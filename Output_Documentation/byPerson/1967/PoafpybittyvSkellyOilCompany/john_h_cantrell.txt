mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
this
case
contains
a
much
deeper
involvement
and
that
indicated
by
state
friend
who
has
proceeding
being
at
this
electorate.
as
will
be
indicated
i
hope
by
the
very
brief
time
which
i
have
to
state
its
various
ramifications.
i
do
believe
by
way
of
preliminary
that
the
opinion
and
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
is
much
broader
in
scope
and
deeper
in
depths
than
that
indicated
by
my
friend.
in
addition
to
that,
i
do
believe
also
that
under
many
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
i
may
present
to
this
court
with
proprietary
matters
concerning
which
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
did
not
speak
consistent
with
the
decree
or
the
decision
which
was
entered.
if
the
matters
were
there
presented
and
either
erroneously
decided
or
ignored
and
for
that
i
have
no
less
authority
than
the
language
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
morley
construction
company
against
maryland
casualty
company,
300
u.s.185
and
191
which
i
would
briefly
refer
without
a
cross
appeal.
an
appellee
may
urge
and
support
of
a
decree
any
matter
appearing
in
the
record.
although
his
argument
may
involve
and
attack
upon
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
court
or
an
insistence
upon
matter
overlooked
or
ignored
by
it.
so
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
i
have
just
found
an
outlining
to
your
honors
the
various
points
which
are
necessarily
involved
in
a
proper
decision
of
the
issues
in
this
court.
initially,
a
feel
i
may
say
with
propriety
that
i
regret
and
even
deplore
the
suggestion
contained
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
the
decision
of
the
two
courts
in
oklahoma
contrary
to
the
claims
of
the
indians
were
the
result
of
racial
discrimination.
i
believe
that
the
record
will
indicate
beyond
per
adventure
of
a
doubt
that
that
is
not
so.
that
the
doors
of
the
courts
were
not
closed
to
these
indians
and
that
they
had
every
possible
proper
consideration
are
their
cause
under
the
procedures
of
a
forum
deliberately
chosen
by
the
petitioners
for
the
advancement
in
their
cause.
and
in
that
connection
i
think
it
is
quite
proper
also
to
indicate
here
very
briefly
and
it
is
covered
in
the
brief
more
fully,
that
upon
the
matter
of
what
the
issues
were
and
what
kind
of
a
case
it
was
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
present,
the
petitioners
made
to
the
trial
court
a
deliberate
election
of
choice
of
the
kind
of
an
action
they
wish
to
pursue.
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
“if
you
will
not
require
us
to
elect
between
the
two
different
types
of
actions
which
might
have
been
wrong,
we
will
state
to
your
honor
that
hereafter
this
will
be
treated
solely
as
an
action
upon
the
contract
to
recover
royalties
due
to
the
petitioners
under
the
terms
of
the
department
of
lease.”
now,
i
say
that
to
your
honors
by
way
of
preliminary
because
while
it
is
not
been
definitely
stated
here
in
argument,
it
is
clear
from
the
greatest
which
have
been
filed
and
the
position
of
the
petitioners
below
that
their
theories
of
their
right
to
maintain
this
action
to
successful
conclusion
are
predicated
upon
the
decision
of
this
court.
in
heckman
versus
united
states
in
the
212
u.s.
412,
224
u.s.
412,
and
upon
an
act
of
congress
which
as
i
recall
is
referred
to
as
the
hasting
act
in
1926,
applicable
only
and
solely
as
specifically
to
the
five
civilized
tribes
of
which
of
course
the
comanches
are
not
among
the
number.
the
heckman
case
is
not
authority
for
the
maintenance
of
this
action
to
successful
conclusion
because
the
heckman
case
contrary
to
counsel's
statement
did
not
involve
an
attempt
to
recover
upon
a
departmental
lease.
but
involved
in
action
by
the
united
states
itself
or
the
cancellation
of
numerous
and
as
i
recall
running
into
thousands
are
cherokee
restricted
indian's
deeds
attempting
to
convey
their
allotments
contrary
to
the
restrictions
imposed
by
congress
and
extended
by
the
congressional
enactment
of
1906.
the
holding
in
that
case
after
reviewing
the
treaties
with
the
cherokees,
the
holding
in
that
case,
a
very
extensive
opinion,
was
boil
down
to
its
ultimate
statement
that
the
united
states
being
the
guardian
of
the
indians
and
the
five
civilized
tribes
owe
the
duty
to
prosecute
upon
the
behalf
of
the
individual
members
of
those
tribes
actions
to
recover
interest
in
their
lands.
and
then
by
way
of
what
i
shall
refer
to
as
considered
victim
because
i
wouldn't
wipe
and
decide
or
attempt
to
believe
with
it.
this
court
said
in
that
connection,
of
course
the
indian
may
bring
his
own
action
to
recover
his
interest
in
tribal
lands
and
if
the
united
states
wish
to
take
over
the
action,
it
could
do
so.
and
following
that,
there
has
been
some
little
use
of
that
victim
in
cases
that
are
entirely
different
from
this
one.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that,
under
the
law
which
is
applicable
to
this
particular
kind
of
case
both
under
the
procedures
adopted
under
the
code
of
procedural
oklahoma
and
the
federal
statutes
and
the
federal
decisions.
there
cannot
be
a
successful
recovery
by
the
indians
in
this
court.
now,
your
honors
i
would
like
to
have
you
bare
with
me
a
moment
while
i
indicate
to
you
what
i
consider
to
be
a
distinction
between
an
action
brought
under
the
court
in
oklahoma
to
recover
an
interest
or
to
protect
an
interest
in
the
lands
and
an
action
like
this
one
which
is
brought
to
recover
alleged
royalties
due
by
way
of
damages
or
otherwise
under
and
because
of
the
terms
of
the
departmental
lease.
there
was
no
departmental
lease
involved
in
the
heckman
case.
the
other
statutory
provision
to
which
reference
has
been
made
as
first
seen
possibly
some
indication
of
authority
for
the
indians
to
maintain
this
suit
to
successful
conclusion
is
as
i
indicated
the
act
of
1926,
which
itself
is
specifically
limited
in
its
effect
to
lands
and
the
civilized
tribes
and
of
course
by
his
very
language
is
not
applicable
to
these
comanches.
and
could
not
be
extended
in
my
judgment
by
judicial
fiat
beyond
that
which
the
congress
clearly
intended
to
accomplish
and
that
was
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
indians
and
the
five
civilized
tribes
to
the
exclusion
of
the
united
states
if
it
refused
to
come
into
the
action.
that's
what
that
act
provide
for.
so
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation
and
we
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
with
a
decision
and
decree
of
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county,
oklahoma
limited
by
virtue
of
venue
provisions
of
the
oklahoma
statutes
to
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
the
contract
to
recover
might
as
do
honor
it.
that
was
the
nature
of
this
action
and
that's
the
sole
nature
of
this
action.
and
that's
the
only
kind
of
an
action
that
the
oklahoma
county
district
court
could
have
tried
or
the
supreme
court
could
have
reviewed.
the
cause
of
action
to
recover
are
established
an
interest
in
the
lands
themselves
or
their
profits
or
their
royalties
or
their
underlying
mineral
areas
had
to
be
instituted
if
it
all
in
the
state
courts
of
oklahoma
in
stevens
county,
oklahoma
where
the
land
lies.
so
that
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county
was
limited
by
the
place
on
torts
to
a
contract
action
upon
the
contract
for
the
recovery
royalties
alleged
to
be
due.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
reason
in
pointing
to
the
declaration
of
the
petitioner's
counsel
to
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
motion
to
elect
was
filed.
my
reason
in
pointing
to
that
was
to
show
that
they
declared
to
the
court
at
that
time
that
this
would
be
that
type
of
action.
otherwise
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
expressed
language
of
the
amended
complaint
upon
which
this
final
judgment
would
enter
and
went
to
the
supreme
court
is
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
recover
royalties
due
under
the
lease.
now,
i'm
going
to
show
to
your
honors
that
royalties
if
they're
indeed
on
this
waste
gas.
if
it
was
waste
gas
were
recoverable
are
on
the
contract
and
not
separate
and
a
part
from
the
contract.
and
that's
where
i
get
to
the
basic
law
which
controlled
this
case
and
which
up
to
now
has
not
been
mentioned
the
oral
argument.
60
statutes
at
large
939
designate
the
powers
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
have
with
respect
to
these
restricted
lands.
it's
also
cited
as
25
u.s.c.a
1
(a).
and
it
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
prescribe
extensive
rule
and
regulations.
and
the
secretary
has
done
so
and
it
has
been
a
time
honored
process.
when
acknowledged
by
the
court
says
legal
and
proper
and
consistently
upheld
through
the
years.
and
in
all
the
circuits
where
indian
affairs
have
been
involved
and
in
this
court
where
they
have
found
their
way
and
that
has
been
the
consistent
holding
of
the
courts
that
these
rules
and
regulations
construed
in
the
light
of
the
statutes
authorizing
them
are
--
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
and
will
be
read
into
a
release.
so
that
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
rights
of
the
parties,
lessor
and
lessee,
are
determinable
from
the
phase
of
the
lease
aided
and
supplemented
wherever
necessary
by
the
rules
and
regulations
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
carrying
out
of
this
guardianship
of
the
indian
wards
of
the
united
states.
and
consistently
throughout,
those
regulations
you
will
find
that
the
only
type
of
a
lease
which
these
indians
could
have
made
was
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
furnished
by
him,
required
--
requiring
the
lessee
to
take
that
kind
of
a
lease
and
requiring
the
lessors
to
make
it.
in
it
there
is
reference
to
these
rules
and
regulations
and
the
lessee
and
the
lessors
are
required
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
rules
and
regulations.
so
that
when
you
come
to
a
determination
of
who
can
prosecute
what
kind
of
an
action
you
must
have
reference
to
those
rules
and
regulations.
the
lease
itself
says
that,
“these
parties
may
not
declare
a
termination.”
and
when
i
say
these
parties,
i
mean
the
petitioners.
these
petitioners
may
not
declare
a
determination
or
bring
about
in
any
form
a
cancellation
of
this
lease
as
long
as
they
are
restricted
and
can
have
no
action
at
law
or
in
equity
to
accomplish
that
result.
in
addition
to
that,
the
rules
and
regulations
specifically
provide
that
in
the
case
of
waste
and
this
question
of
what
is
waste
under
these
regulations
is
a
very
involved
and
serious
one.
what
it
provides
the
regulations
provide
that
in
the
case
of
a
waste
of
gas,
determined
waste
of
gas,
a
royalty
shall
be
paid
sets
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
not
to
be
less
than
five
cents
for
every
1,000
cubic
feet
of
the
gas
waste.
but
along
with
that
determination
and
whether
or
not
there
ha
been
a
waste
of
gas,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
authorized
through
his
subordinates,
to
whom
he
may
delegate
the
authority,
to
manage
the
operation
of
the
lease
hold
estate
created
by
this
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease.
so
that
the
lessee
is
required
and
every
step
of
the
way
in
the
operations
of
the
oil
and
gas
leases
in
their
drilling,
in
their
production
and
their
sale,
to
account
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
has
his
agent
on
the
ground
directing
the
operations.
and
the
complaint
in
this
case
itself
shows
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
wells
which
were
producing
oil
were
also
producing
gas
and
that
the
gas
was
being
vented
and
because
there
was
no
market
for
the
gas.
and
that
went
on
with
the
approval
of
the
supervisor
until
such
time
as
the
market
was
found
for
the
gas.
and
there
is
a
potent,
very
sound
economic
reason
for
it
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
through
his
supervisory
doctrine.
there
were
five
wells
or
seven
wells
surrounded
by
other
wells
which
were
being
produced.
unless
these
wells
were
produced,
the
oil
would
be
drained
from
under
them.
and
the
only
way
they
could
be
produced
would
be
to
flare
the
gas.
in
order
that
the
person
the
gas
would
force
to
this
high
gravity
oil
to
the
surface
which
could
be
marketed
and
during
this
whole
period
during
which
this
gas
was
flared,
the
oil
was
taken
under
the
direction
of
the
supervisor,
marketed,
converted
it
into
money,
and
paid
into
the
hand
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
according
to
the
terms
of
the
departmental
lease.
so
that
when
it's
our
court
came
to
consider
the
federal
law
and
we
concede
without
hesitation
that
the
federal
law
control
this
question
of
who
could
proceed
on
that
lease.
what
could
be
recovered
on
it?
how
the
lease
had
to
be
operated?
what
the
authority
of
the
secretary
was?
and
above
all,
what
protection
the
lessee
got
from
following
the
directions
of
the
interiors
--
secretary
of
the
interiors
supervision?
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
think
it
would
have
made
this
difference
mr.
chief
justice
that
under
the
oklahoma
code
if
the
place
had
not
voluntarily
elected
to
go
to
the
contract
route
to
recover
upon
the
contract.
then
the
court
would
have
required
--
would
have
to
require
them
to
have
elected
which
cause
of
action
they
were
going
on
because
there
were
inconsistent
cause
of
action
under
our
code
and
if
they
had
elected
to
go
the
contract
route
to
recover
for
the
waste
to
protect
their
leasehold
estate
from
waste,
they
would
have
been
relegated
to
re-filing
their
suit
in
steven's
county,
oklahoma
rather
than
oklahoma
county,
oklahoma.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
could
have
gone,
and
then
it
could
have
been
urged
with
some
propriety
under
the
heckman
decision
that
they
might
have
been
able
to
have
prosecuted
that
case,
if
they
could
have
overcome.
and
here
again
mr.
chief
justice,
i
come
back
to
those
things
which
are
involved
in
this
case
which
lied
its
art
and
which
make
it
very
important.
if
they
could
have
overcome
the
presumptions
that
exist
that
the
supervisor
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
their
duty
and
then
what
was
done
under
their
supervision
was
a
proper
thing
to
do.
and
there
again,
this
was
no
waste.
this
was
not
waste
and
could
not
be
classified
or
categorized
as
waste.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
are
substantially
right
in
the
statement.
but
it
overlooks
that
which
we
have
considered
to
be
sacred
and
they
have
the
force
and
effect
even
of
law
in
oklahoma.
that
when
the
counsel
makes
a
commitment
to
the
court
in
open
court
of
which
a
record
is
made,
that
we
will
not
hereafter
claim
anything
in
this
suit
other
than
the
right
to
recover
upon
the
contract.
we
think
that
under
our
code
in
oklahoma,
they
are
to
be
held
to
it.
and
i
find
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
your
honor
will
find
it
in
the
record
and
i
have
also
quoted
in
the
brief.
you
honor
will
find
it
in
the
record
at
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
it
is
partially
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
here
is
the
significance
of
the
court's
order.
board
announcement
of
appraised
counsel
to
the
court
that
well
said
language
before
had
stricken
from
said
petition.
only
one
cause
of
action
is
stated,
presented
by
or
intended
to
be
asserted
in
and
by
said
petition
and
that
only
recovery
in
contract
will
be
sought
in
this
action
by
appellees.
the
motion
of
the
defendant
to
require
election
is
between
two
separate
causes
of
action.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
one
more
thing
you
overlook
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
is
the
oklahoma
venue
statute
which
immediately
--
would
have
immediately
ousted
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county
in
any
jurisdiction
to
have
heard
this
case
upon
any
searched
ground
because
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear.
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
are
now
numerous
to
that
effect
that
an
action
such
as
this,
if
it
be
for
a
waste
for
taking
off
the
dissipation
of
the
interest
land
itself,
is
an
action
which
must
be
brought
in
the
county
where
the
land
lies.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
might
be
an
action
on
the
contract,
mr.
justice
white.
but
at
the
same
time
under
the
oklahoma
statute,
it
is
for
taking
of
the
nature
of
a
contract
which
had
to
be
brought
in
stephens
county
and
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
in
oklahoma
county.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
is
a
venue
problem.
but
the
problem
was
raised
and
from
the
assurance
of
counsel
that
the
other
cause
of
action
was
not
involved
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
would
think
that
your
honor,
it
does
concern
you
to
this
extent,
that
in
reviewing
a
decision
on
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
which
in
turn
reviews
their
decision
of
nisi
prius
court
that
your
honors
would
have
to
consider
yourselves
bound
by
the
established
procedures
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
it's
an
action
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it's
an
action
on
the
contract
which
is
for
royalty
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
--
provided
for
in
the
regulations
which
you
are
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
as
absolute
control
of
and
if
no
one
else
can
exercise
any
authority
over
it
and
it
falls
neither
within
any
philosophy
announced
in
the
heckman
decision
or
any
philosophy
ever
adopted
by
the
congress
of
united
states.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
they
signed
it
accept
to
say
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
no,
mr.
justice
white.
i
do
not
say
that.
i'm
about
to
point
out
the
remedy
which
they
did
have
and
do
have.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
under
the
regulations.
all
these
indians
had
to
do
was
to
apply
to
the
supervisor
for
an
order
directing
either
the
cessation
of
the
flaring
of
the
gas
or
the
accounting
and
paying
for
the
royalty,
under
the
regulations
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
its
section
221.35
of
chapter
2
of
title
30
of
the
federal
code
of
regulations.
under
that
provision,
all
these
indians
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
the
supervisor
and
say,
we
want
give
this
flaring
stop
that
we
want
to
be
paid
for
it.
the
supervisor
would
have
been
required
at
that
time
to
have
made
a
formal
decision
and
stated
it
one
way
or
another
from
which
an
appeal
would
have
been
permissible
and
allowed
are
cleared
up
to
the
secretary
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
--
to
the
secretary
to
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
and
then
it
would
be
determined
by
the
merits
of
the
congress.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
went
clearly
to
the
secretary
then
you
go
to
the
courts.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
go
to
the
court
--
the
losing
party
goes
to
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
now
--
and
now
your
honors
will
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
no
allegation
anywhere
in
any
pleading
filed
by
the
petitioners.
that
there
was
never
any
kind
of
misconduct
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
--
they
--
if
they
go
up
to
the
administrative
remedy
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
turns
him
down.
there
is
a
remedy
provided
but
it's
just
what
for
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
it's
the
secretary.
and
we're
--
the
lessee
is
absolutely
bound
by
the
orders
of
the
secretary
as
to
depend
of
these
orders.
and
only
the
secretary,
only
the
secretary
can
recover
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
in
the
same
manner.
and
that's
the
only
manner
the
lessee
could
review
his
orders
by.
there
is
an
administrative
remedy
provided
for
both
of
these
parties
and
neither
--
neither
the
indians
has
ever
sought
to
exercise
it
and
it
is
still
open
to.
the
basic
fundamental
propositions
have
been
decided
by
the
courts
involving
these
federal
regulations
and
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
proceed
themselves
without
proceeding
through
the
secretary
numerous
cases.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
the
secretary
must
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
has
been
no
formal
information
granted.
there
was
an
act
of
a
subordinate
employee
and
the
indian
officer
in
oklahoma
approving
the
attorney
contract
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes.
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
in
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
that
this
court
ought
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
then
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
there
is
some
suggestion
that
solicitor
general
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
don't
find
that
the
opinion
there
given
is
very
clearly
stated
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
are
ifs
and
ands
about
it.
for
instance,
the
question
of
asset
of
double
exposure
is
discussed
and
it
is
very
clearly
stated.
and
in
connection
with
that,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
also
to
what
can
happen
to
the
guardian
and
ward
relationship
and
the
administrative
regulation
of
the
affairs
of
these
indians
if
they
--
every
time
they
get
dissatisfied
can
bring
an
action
which
is
directly
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
secretary.
now,
in
connection
with
this
proposition
of
why
--
what
the
secretary's
position
is,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
race
and
because
of
anticipation
that
the
very
thing
which
is
now
being
argued
might
be
argued.
we
notified
the
government
of
the
pendency
of
this
action
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
invited
the
government
to
come
in
and
take
the
action
over
and
the
government
refused
to
do
so.
now,
if
there
has
been
a
determination
by
the
department
that
the
government
couldn't
win
or
shouldn't
prosecute
this
action
then
i
think
it
only
stricken
the
proposition
that
unless
the
hands
of
the
secretary
are
upheld
unless
his
regulations
are
enforced
and
unless
the
scheme
of
regulation
which
the
congress
itself
has
specifically
provided
for.
isn't
here
to
regulation
goes
out
the
window.
and
no
oil
operator
and
this
is
a
very
practical
suggestion.
no
oil
operator
could
ever
afford
to
accept
and
pay
for
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease
and
develop
it.
under
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
requiring
that
operator
to
abide
by
the
secretary's
decisions
and
directions
as
to
the
modus
operandi,
what
was
to
be
paid
for,
what
was
to
be
used
on
the
lease
to
produce
oil
and
then
after
the
fact,
have
the
lessor
in
is
the
restricted
indians
double
back
on
that
decision
and
go
to
the
court
and
say
we
won't
need
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
no
mr.
justice
white.
it's
not
quite
that
sample
if
you
would
pardon
me
to
say
that.
when
the
secretary
has
exhausted
the
facts
has
made
the
record
and
that
may
--
and
has
made
a
determination
of
fact
based
upon
that
record
and
then
has
decided
the
case,
it
will
not
be
then
a
matter
or
first
impression
where
this
court
or
another
court
reviewing
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well
your
honor,
i
merely
say
that
there
should
be
adherence
to
the
time
honored
and
almost
universally
adopted
principle
that
wherein
administrative
remedy
is
provided
by
and
for
and
through
an
administrative
body
which
has
been
plowed
with
the
power,
the
exclusive
power,
to
provide
it
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
that
the
courts
themselves
should
not
be
the
ones
to
change
the
law.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
your
honor,
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
can
be
said
to
be
the
actual
fact
unless
you
carry
to
disregard
all
of
the
past
history
of
the
operations
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
how
it's
been
handled.
and
now
take
a
new
view
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they're
in
which
county.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
oh,
i
think
so
and
now
that
is
a
sign
from
the
administrative
remedy
argument.
that's
assuming
if
there
wasn't
any
administrator
remedy.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
but
that
was
before
i
raised
the
discussion
of
the
administrator
remedy
proposition.
i
think
that
before
they
could
get
into
any
court
with
proprietary
properly
and
successfully
maintained
an
action
there,
they
must
have
shown
and
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
which
i
think
were
explicit.
but
assuming
that
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
then
they
would
have
had
to
brought
this
action
for
which
in
a
different
county
from
the
one
we
brought
up.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
think
my
light
is
on.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
this
case
contains
a
much
deeper
involvement
and
that
indicated
by
state
friend
who
has
proceeding
being
at
this
electorate.
as
will
be
indicated
i
hope
by
the
very
brief
time
which
i
have
to
state
its
various
ramifications.
i
do
believe
by
way
of
preliminary
that
the
opinion
and
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
is
much
broader
in
scope
and
deeper
in
depths
than
that
indicated
by
my
friend.
in
addition
to
that,
i
do
believe
also
that
under
many
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
i
may
present
to
this
court
with
proprietary
matters
concerning
which
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
did
not
speak
consistent
with
the
decree
or
the
decision
which
was
entered.
if
the
matters
were
there
presented
and
either
erroneously
decided
or
ignored
and
for
that
i
have
no
less
authority
than
the
language
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
morley
construction
company
against
maryland
casualty
company,
300
u.s.185
and
191
which
i
would
briefly
refer
without
a
cross
appeal.
an
appellee
may
urge
and
support
of
a
decree
any
matter
appearing
in
the
record.
although
his
argument
may
involve
and
attack
upon
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
court
or
an
insistence
upon
matter
overlooked
or
ignored
by
it.
so
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
i
have
just
found
an
outlining
to
your
honors
the
various
points
which
are
necessarily
involved
in
a
proper
decision
of
the
issues
in
this
court.
initially,
a
feel
i
may
say
with
propriety
that
i
regret
and
even
deplore
the
suggestion
contained
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
the
decision
of
the
two
courts
in
oklahoma
contrary
to
the
claims
of
the
indians
were
the
result
of
racial
discrimination.
i
believe
that
the
record
will
indicate
beyond
per
adventure
of
a
doubt
that
that
is
not
so.
that
the
doors
of
the
courts
were
not
closed
to
these
indians
and
that
they
had
every
possible
proper
consideration
are
their
cause
under
the
procedures
of
a
forum
deliberately
chosen
by
the
petitioners
for
the
advancement
in
their
cause.
and
in
that
connection
i
think
it
is
quite
proper
also
to
indicate
here
very
briefly
and
it
is
covered
in
the
brief
more
fully,
that
upon
the
matter
of
what
the
issues
were
and
what
kind
of
a
case
it
was
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
present,
the
petitioners
made
to
the
trial
court
a
deliberate
election
of
choice
of
the
kind
of
an
action
they
wish
to
pursue.
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
“if
you
will
not
require
us
to
elect
between
the
two
different
types
of
actions
which
might
have
been
wrong,
we
will
state
to
your
honor
that
hereafter
this
will
be
treated
solely
as
an
action
upon
the
contract
to
recover
royalties
due
to
the
petitioners
under
the
terms
of
the
department
of
lease.”
now,
i
say
that
to
your
honors
by
way
of
preliminary
because
while
it
is
not
been
definitely
stated
here
in
argument,
it
is
clear
from
the
greatest
which
have
been
filed
and
the
position
of
the
petitioners
below
that
their
theories
of
their
right
to
maintain
this
action
to
successful
conclusion
are
predicated
upon
the
decision
of
this
court.
in
heckman
versus
united
states
in
the
212
u.s.
412,
224
u.s.
412,
and
upon
an
act
of
congress
which
as
i
recall
is
referred
to
as
the
hasting
act
in
1926,
applicable
only
and
solely
as
specifically
to
the
five
civilized
tribes
of
which
of
course
the
comanches
are
not
among
the
number.
the
heckman
case
is
not
authority
for
the
maintenance
of
this
action
to
successful
conclusion
because
the
heckman
case
contrary
to
counsel's
statement
did
not
involve
an
attempt
to
recover
upon
a
departmental
lease.
but
involved
in
action
by
the
united
states
itself
or
the
cancellation
of
numerous
and
as
i
recall
running
into
thousands
are
cherokee
restricted
indian's
deeds
attempting
to
convey
their
allotments
contrary
to
the
restrictions
imposed
by
congress
and
extended
by
the
congressional
enactment
of
1906.
the
holding
in
that
case
after
reviewing
the
treaties
with
the
cherokees,
the
holding
in
that
case,
a
very
extensive
opinion,
was
boil
down
to
its
ultimate
statement
that
the
united
states
being
the
guardian
of
the
indians
and
the
five
civilized
tribes
owe
the
duty
to
prosecute
upon
the
behalf
of
the
individual
members
of
those
tribes
actions
to
recover
interest
in
their
lands.
and
then
by
way
of
what
i
shall
refer
to
as
considered
victim
because
i
wouldn't
wipe
and
decide
or
attempt
to
believe
with
it.
this
court
said
in
that
connection,
of
course
the
indian
may
bring
his
own
action
to
recover
his
interest
in
tribal
lands
and
if
the
united
states
wish
to
take
over
the
action,
it
could
do
so.
and
following
that,
there
has
been
some
little
use
of
that
victim
in
cases
that
are
entirely
different
from
this
one.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that,
under
the
law
which
is
applicable
to
this
particular
kind
of
case
both
under
the
procedures
adopted
under
the
code
of
procedural
oklahoma
and
the
federal
statutes
and
the
federal
decisions.
there
cannot
be
a
successful
recovery
by
the
indians
in
this
court.
now,
your
honors
i
would
like
to
have
you
bare
with
me
a
moment
while
i
indicate
to
you
what
i
consider
to
be
a
distinction
between
an
action
brought
under
the
court
in
oklahoma
to
recover
an
interest
or
to
protect
an
interest
in
the
lands
and
an
action
like
this
one
which
is
brought
to
recover
alleged
royalties
due
by
way
of
damages
or
otherwise
under
and
because
of
the
terms
of
the
departmental
lease.
there
was
no
departmental
lease
involved
in
the
heckman
case.
the
other
statutory
provision
to
which
reference
has
been
made
as
first
seen
possibly
some
indication
of
authority
for
the
indians
to
maintain
this
suit
to
successful
conclusion
is
as
i
indicated
the
act
of
1926,
which
itself
is
specifically
limited
in
its
effect
to
lands
and
the
civilized
tribes
and
of
course
by
his
very
language
is
not
applicable
to
these
comanches.
and
could
not
be
extended
in
my
judgment
by
judicial
fiat
beyond
that
which
the
congress
clearly
intended
to
accomplish
and
that
was
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
indians
and
the
five
civilized
tribes
to
the
exclusion
of
the
united
states
if
it
refused
to
come
into
the
action.
that's
what
that
act
provide
for.
so
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation
and
we
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
with
a
decision
and
decree
of
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county,
oklahoma
limited
by
virtue
of
venue
provisions
of
the
oklahoma
statutes
to
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
the
contract
to
recover
might
as
do
honor
it.
that
was
the
nature
of
this
action
and
that's
the
sole
nature
of
this
action.
and
that's
the
only
kind
of
an
action
that
the
oklahoma
county
district
court
could
have
tried
or
the
supreme
court
could
have
reviewed.
the
cause
of
action
to
recover
are
established
an
interest
in
the
lands
themselves
or
their
profits
or
their
royalties
or
their
underlying
mineral
areas
had
to
be
instituted
if
it
all
in
the
state
courts
of
oklahoma
in
stevens
county,
oklahoma
where
the
land
lies.
so
that
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county
was
limited
by
the
place
on
torts
to
a
contract
action
upon
the
contract
for
the
recovery
royalties
alleged
to
be
due.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
reason
in
pointing
to
the
declaration
of
the
petitioner's
counsel
to
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
motion
to
elect
was
filed.
my
reason
in
pointing
to
that
was
to
show
that
they
declared
to
the
court
at
that
time
that
this
would
be
that
type
of
action.
otherwise
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
expressed
language
of
the
amended
complaint
upon
which
this
final
judgment
would
enter
and
went
to
the
supreme
court
is
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
recover
royalties
due
under
the
lease.
now,
i'm
going
to
show
to
your
honors
that
royalties
if
they're
indeed
on
this
waste
gas.
if
it
was
waste
gas
were
recoverable
are
on
the
contract
and
not
separate
and
a
part
from
the
contract.
and
that's
where
i
get
to
the
basic
law
which
controlled
this
case
and
which
up
to
now
has
not
been
mentioned
the
oral
argument.
60
statutes
at
large
939
designate
the
powers
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
have
with
respect
to
these
restricted
lands.
it's
also
cited
as
25
u.s.c.a
1
(a).
and
it
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
prescribe
extensive
rule
and
regulations.
and
the
secretary
has
done
so
and
it
has
been
a
time
honored
process.
when
acknowledged
by
the
court
says
legal
and
proper
and
consistently
upheld
through
the
years.
and
in
all
the
circuits
where
indian
affairs
have
been
involved
and
in
this
court
where
they
have
found
their
way
and
that
has
been
the
consistent
holding
of
the
courts
that
these
rules
and
regulations
construed
in
the
light
of
the
statutes
authorizing
them
are
--
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
and
will
be
read
into
a
release.
so
that
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
rights
of
the
parties,
lessor
and
lessee,
are
determinable
from
the
phase
of
the
lease
aided
and
supplemented
wherever
necessary
by
the
rules
and
regulations
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
carrying
out
of
this
guardianship
of
the
indian
wards
of
the
united
states.
and
consistently
throughout,
those
regulations
you
will
find
that
the
only
type
of
a
lease
which
these
indians
could
have
made
was
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
furnished
by
him,
required
--
requiring
the
lessee
to
take
that
kind
of
a
lease
and
requiring
the
lessors
to
make
it.
in
it
there
is
reference
to
these
rules
and
regulations
and
the
lessee
and
the
lessors
are
required
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
rules
and
regulations.
so
that
when
you
come
to
a
determination
of
who
can
prosecute
what
kind
of
an
action
you
must
have
reference
to
those
rules
and
regulations.
the
lease
itself
says
that,
“these
parties
may
not
declare
a
termination.”
and
when
i
say
these
parties,
i
mean
the
petitioners.
these
petitioners
may
not
declare
a
determination
or
bring
about
in
any
form
a
cancellation
of
this
lease
as
long
as
they
are
restricted
and
can
have
no
action
at
law
or
in
equity
to
accomplish
that
result.
in
addition
to
that,
the
rules
and
regulations
specifically
provide
that
in
the
case
of
waste
and
this
question
of
what
is
waste
under
these
regulations
is
a
very
involved
and
serious
one.
what
it
provides
the
regulations
provide
that
in
the
case
of
a
waste
of
gas,
determined
waste
of
gas,
a
royalty
shall
be
paid
sets
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
not
to
be
less
than
five
cents
for
every
1,000
cubic
feet
of
the
gas
waste.
but
along
with
that
determination
and
whether
or
not
there
ha
been
a
waste
of
gas,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
authorized
through
his
subordinates,
to
whom
he
may
delegate
the
authority,
to
manage
the
operation
of
the
lease
hold
estate
created
by
this
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease.
so
that
the
lessee
is
required
and
every
step
of
the
way
in
the
operations
of
the
oil
and
gas
leases
in
their
drilling,
in
their
production
and
their
sale,
to
account
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
has
his
agent
on
the
ground
directing
the
operations.
and
the
complaint
in
this
case
itself
shows
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
wells
which
were
producing
oil
were
also
producing
gas
and
that
the
gas
was
being
vented
and
because
there
was
no
market
for
the
gas.
and
that
went
on
with
the
approval
of
the
supervisor
until
such
time
as
the
market
was
found
for
the
gas.
and
there
is
a
potent,
very
sound
economic
reason
for
it
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
through
his
supervisory
doctrine.
there
were
five
wells
or
seven
wells
surrounded
by
other
wells
which
were
being
produced.
unless
these
wells
were
produced,
the
oil
would
be
drained
from
under
them.
and
the
only
way
they
could
be
produced
would
be
to
flare
the
gas.
in
order
that
the
person
the
gas
would
force
to
this
high
gravity
oil
to
the
surface
which
could
be
marketed
and
during
this
whole
period
during
which
this
gas
was
flared,
the
oil
was
taken
under
the
direction
of
the
supervisor,
marketed,
converted
it
into
money,
and
paid
into
the
hand
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
according
to
the
terms
of
the
departmental
lease.
so
that
when
it's
our
court
came
to
consider
the
federal
law
and
we
concede
without
hesitation
that
the
federal
law
control
this
question
of
who
could
proceed
on
that
lease.
what
could
be
recovered
on
it?
how
the
lease
had
to
be
operated?
what
the
authority
of
the
secretary
was?
and
above
all,
what
protection
the
lessee
got
from
following
the
directions
of
the
interiors
--
secretary
of
the
interiors
supervision?
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
think
it
would
have
made
this
difference
mr.
chief
justice
that
under
the
oklahoma
code
if
the
place
had
not
voluntarily
elected
to
go
to
the
contract
route
to
recover
upon
the
contract.
then
the
court
would
have
required
--
would
have
to
require
them
to
have
elected
which
cause
of
action
they
were
going
on
because
there
were
inconsistent
cause
of
action
under
our
code
and
if
they
had
elected
to
go
the
contract
route
to
recover
for
the
waste
to
protect
their
leasehold
estate
from
waste,
they
would
have
been
relegated
to
re-filing
their
suit
in
steven's
county,
oklahoma
rather
than
oklahoma
county,
oklahoma.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
could
have
gone,
and
then
it
could
have
been
urged
with
some
propriety
under
the
heckman
decision
that
they
might
have
been
able
to
have
prosecuted
that
case,
if
they
could
have
overcome.
and
here
again
mr.
chief
justice,
i
come
back
to
those
things
which
are
involved
in
this
case
which
lied
its
art
and
which
make
it
very
important.
if
they
could
have
overcome
the
presumptions
that
exist
that
the
supervisor
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
their
duty
and
then
what
was
done
under
their
supervision
was
a
proper
thing
to
do.
and
there
again,
this
was
no
waste.
this
was
not
waste
and
could
not
be
classified
or
categorized
as
waste.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
are
substantially
right
in
the
statement.
but
it
overlooks
that
which
we
have
considered
to
be
sacred
and
they
have
the
force
and
effect
even
of
law
in
oklahoma.
that
when
the
counsel
makes
a
commitment
to
the
court
in
open
court
of
which
a
record
is
made,
that
we
will
not
hereafter
claim
anything
in
this
suit
other
than
the
right
to
recover
upon
the
contract.
we
think
that
under
our
code
in
oklahoma,
they
are
to
be
held
to
it.
and
i
find
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
your
honor
will
find
it
in
the
record
and
i
have
also
quoted
in
the
brief.
you
honor
will
find
it
in
the
record
at
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
it
is
partially
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
here
is
the
significance
of
the
court's
order.
board
announcement
of
appraised
counsel
to
the
court
that
well
said
language
before
had
stricken
from
said
petition.
only
one
cause
of
action
is
stated,
presented
by
or
intended
to
be
asserted
in
and
by
said
petition
and
that
only
recovery
in
contract
will
be
sought
in
this
action
by
appellees.
the
motion
of
the
defendant
to
require
election
is
between
two
separate
causes
of
action.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
one
more
thing
you
overlook
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
is
the
oklahoma
venue
statute
which
immediately
--
would
have
immediately
ousted
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county
in
any
jurisdiction
to
have
heard
this
case
upon
any
searched
ground
because
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear.
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
are
now
numerous
to
that
effect
that
an
action
such
as
this,
if
it
be
for
a
waste
for
taking
off
the
dissipation
of
the
interest
land
itself,
is
an
action
which
must
be
brought
in
the
county
where
the
land
lies.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
might
be
an
action
on
the
contract,
mr.
justice
white.
but
at
the
same
time
under
the
oklahoma
statute,
it
is
for
taking
of
the
nature
of
a
contract
which
had
to
be
brought
in
stephens
county
and
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
in
oklahoma
county.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
is
a
venue
problem.
but
the
problem
was
raised
and
from
the
assurance
of
counsel
that
the
other
cause
of
action
was
not
involved
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
would
think
that
your
honor,
it
does
concern
you
to
this
extent,
that
in
reviewing
a
decision
on
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
which
in
turn
reviews
their
decision
of
nisi
prius
court
that
your
honors
would
have
to
consider
yourselves
bound
by
the
established
procedures
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
it's
an
action
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it's
an
action
on
the
contract
which
is
for
royalty
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
--
provided
for
in
the
regulations
which
you
are
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
as
absolute
control
of
and
if
no
one
else
can
exercise
any
authority
over
it
and
it
falls
neither
within
any
philosophy
announced
in
the
heckman
decision
or
any
philosophy
ever
adopted
by
the
congress
of
united
states.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
they
signed
it
accept
to
say
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
no,
mr.
justice
white.
i
do
not
say
that.
i'm
about
to
point
out
the
remedy
which
they
did
have
and
do
have.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
under
the
regulations.
all
these
indians
had
to
do
was
to
apply
to
the
supervisor
for
an
order
directing
either
the
cessation
of
the
flaring
of
the
gas
or
the
accounting
and
paying
for
the
royalty,
under
the
regulations
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
its
section
221.35
of
chapter
2
of
title
30
of
the
federal
code
of
regulations.
under
that
provision,
all
these
indians
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
the
supervisor
and
say,
we
want
give
this
flaring
stop
that
we
want
to
be
paid
for
it.
the
supervisor
would
have
been
required
at
that
time
to
have
made
a
formal
decision
and
stated
it
one
way
or
another
from
which
an
appeal
would
have
been
permissible
and
allowed
are
cleared
up
to
the
secretary
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
--
to
the
secretary
to
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
and
then
it
would
be
determined
by
the
merits
of
the
congress.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
it
went
clearly
to
the
secretary
then
you
go
to
the
courts.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
go
to
the
court
--
the
losing
party
goes
to
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
now
--
and
now
your
honors
will
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
no
allegation
anywhere
in
any
pleading
filed
by
the
petitioners.
that
there
was
never
any
kind
of
misconduct
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they
--
they
--
if
they
go
up
to
the
administrative
remedy
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
turns
him
down.
there
is
a
remedy
provided
but
it's
just
what
for
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
it's
the
secretary.
and
we're
--
the
lessee
is
absolutely
bound
by
the
orders
of
the
secretary
as
to
depend
of
these
orders.
and
only
the
secretary,
only
the
secretary
can
recover
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
in
the
same
manner.
and
that's
the
only
manner
the
lessee
could
review
his
orders
by.
there
is
an
administrative
remedy
provided
for
both
of
these
parties
and
neither
--
neither
the
indians
has
ever
sought
to
exercise
it
and
it
is
still
open
to.
the
basic
fundamental
propositions
have
been
decided
by
the
courts
involving
these
federal
regulations
and
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
proceed
themselves
without
proceeding
through
the
secretary
numerous
cases.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
the
secretary
must
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
has
been
no
formal
information
granted.
there
was
an
act
of
a
subordinate
employee
and
the
indian
officer
in
oklahoma
approving
the
attorney
contract
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes.
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
in
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
that
this
court
ought
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
then
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
there
is
some
suggestion
that
solicitor
general
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
don't
find
that
the
opinion
there
given
is
very
clearly
stated
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
are
ifs
and
ands
about
it.
for
instance,
the
question
of
asset
of
double
exposure
is
discussed
and
it
is
very
clearly
stated.
and
in
connection
with
that,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
also
to
what
can
happen
to
the
guardian
and
ward
relationship
and
the
administrative
regulation
of
the
affairs
of
these
indians
if
they
--
every
time
they
get
dissatisfied
can
bring
an
action
which
is
directly
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
secretary.
now,
in
connection
with
this
proposition
of
why
--
what
the
secretary's
position
is,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
race
and
because
of
anticipation
that
the
very
thing
which
is
now
being
argued
might
be
argued.
we
notified
the
government
of
the
pendency
of
this
action
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
invited
the
government
to
come
in
and
take
the
action
over
and
the
government
refused
to
do
so.
now,
if
there
has
been
a
determination
by
the
department
that
the
government
couldn't
win
or
shouldn't
prosecute
this
action
then
i
think
it
only
stricken
the
proposition
that
unless
the
hands
of
the
secretary
are
upheld
unless
his
regulations
are
enforced
and
unless
the
scheme
of
regulation
which
the
congress
itself
has
specifically
provided
for.
isn't
here
to
regulation
goes
out
the
window.
and
no
oil
operator
and
this
is
a
very
practical
suggestion.
no
oil
operator
could
ever
afford
to
accept
and
pay
for
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease
and
develop
it.
under
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
requiring
that
operator
to
abide
by
the
secretary's
decisions
and
directions
as
to
the
modus
operandi,
what
was
to
be
paid
for,
what
was
to
be
used
on
the
lease
to
produce
oil
and
then
after
the
fact,
have
the
lessor
in
is
the
restricted
indians
double
back
on
that
decision
and
go
to
the
court
and
say
we
won't
need
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
no
mr.
justice
white.
it's
not
quite
that
sample
if
you
would
pardon
me
to
say
that.
when
the
secretary
has
exhausted
the
facts
has
made
the
record
and
that
may
--
and
has
made
a
determination
of
fact
based
upon
that
record
and
then
has
decided
the
case,
it
will
not
be
then
a
matter
or
first
impression
where
this
court
or
another
court
reviewing
--
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well
your
honor,
i
merely
say
that
there
should
be
adherence
to
the
time
honored
and
almost
universally
adopted
principle
that
wherein
administrative
remedy
is
provided
by
and
for
and
through
an
administrative
body
which
has
been
plowed
with
the
power,
the
exclusive
power,
to
provide
it
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
that
the
courts
themselves
should
not
be
the
ones
to
change
the
law.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
well,
your
honor,
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
can
be
said
to
be
the
actual
fact
unless
you
carry
to
disregard
all
of
the
past
history
of
the
operations
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
how
it's
been
handled.
and
now
take
a
new
view
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
they're
in
which
county.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
oh,
i
think
so
and
now
that
is
a
sign
from
the
administrative
remedy
argument.
that's
assuming
if
there
wasn't
any
administrator
remedy.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
but
that
was
before
i
raised
the
discussion
of
the
administrator
remedy
proposition.
i
think
that
before
they
could
get
into
any
court
with
proprietary
properly
and
successfully
maintained
an
action
there,
they
must
have
shown
and
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
which
i
think
were
explicit.
but
assuming
that
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
then
they
would
have
had
to
brought
this
action
for
which
in
a
different
county
from
the
one
we
brought
up.
mr.
john
h.
cantrell
i
think
my
light
is
on.
