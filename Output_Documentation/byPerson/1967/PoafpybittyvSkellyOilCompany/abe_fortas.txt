that's
not

way
their
complaint
reads.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
that's
not
what
they're
complaint
says?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
a
complain
--
is
a
complaint
is
an
action
for
waste
and
the
damages
asserted
is
stated
in
terms
of
--
of
the
lost
of
royalty.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
action
itself
is
an
action
for
waste,
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
see
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
in
their
second
amended
--
in
their
amended
complaint
in
response
to
the
court
decision.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
abandon
their
cause
of
action
for
waste
as
i
read
it.
can
you
tell
me
whether
i'm
right
or
wrong?
they
alleged
that
they
had
been
injured
by
the
wrongful
flaring
of
gas
and
they
expressly
said
that
the
defendant
has
illegally
committed
waste
in
the
premises.
and
they're
going
to
say
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease
which
they
these
petitioners
signed.
and
so,
they
claim
damages
on
account
of
the
wrongful
and
the
illegal
waste
that
they
allege
in
violation
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease.
that
the
damages
to
be
measured
by
the
royalty
that
they
would
have
received
had
the
waste
not
occurred.
is
that
--
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
find
it
i
think
you're
talking
about
page
18
of
the
record.
what
happened
here
as
i
understand
it
is
that
counsel
agreed
to
strike
an
allegation
that
the
waste
was
in
violation
of
the
conservation
statutes
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
counsel
did
agree
that
he
was
--
his
claim
was
founded
upon
the
provision
in
the
oil
and
gas
lease
that
prohibits
the
lessees,
skelly
oil
company
respondent
here,
from
committing
waste.
now,
is
that
right
or
is
it
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
well
tell
me,
where
it's
partially
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
sir.
but
the

the
petition

what
was

that
is
that
the

action
for
waste

the
cause
of
action
for
waste
is
preserved

it
is
bottomed
upon

lease
which
commence
the
lessee
not
to
commit
a
waste.
