mr.
charles
hill
johns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
comanche
indians
residing
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
they
own
some
lands
that
were
originally
allotted
to
their
predecessor
under
the
general
allotment
act.
the
lands
are
restricted
against
alienation.
under
the
general
allotment
act,
these
indian
owners
are
permitted
to
make
an
oil
and
gas
lease.
but
the
oil
and
gas
lease
must
be
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
they
lease
some
lands
to
skelly
oil
company.
skelly
oil
company
drilled;
sell
in
wells
on
the
property,
produced
oil
and
gas.
they
flag
the
gas
into
the
air.
petitioners
filed
suit
against
skelly
asking
damages,
money
damages
for
a
breach
of
the
expressed
and
implied
governance
of
the
lease.
and
notified
the
united
states,
invited
them
to
come
into
the
lawsuit.
they
did
not
elect
to
come
into
the
case.
a
trial
course
sustained
a
demurrer
which
is
comparable
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
federal
practice
and
it
would
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
held
by
reason
of
the
federal
restrictions
against
alienation.
these
indian
lessor
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
bring
a
suit
for
damage.
after
the
supreme
court
had
so
held
by
appropriate
proceedings,
we
filed
an
application
for
a
certiorari
which
was
granted
by
this
court.
the
united
states
at
the
invitation
of
the
court,
i
have
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
and
the
united
states
supports
our
position.
so
simply
stated
it
is
our
position,
the
only
one
question
here
is
whether
indian
lessors
in
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease
have
the
capacity
to
institute
and
maintain
a
suit
for
damages
without
the
joiner
the
of
the
united
states.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
the
united
states
had
a
perfect
right
to
bring
such
a
lawsuit.
it's
our
position
the
indian
lessors
have
their
right
to
bring
such
a
lawsuit.
the
case
is
here
as
the
court
please,
on
a
question
of
the
pleadings
that
ended
demurrer
was
sustained.
all
the
allegations
of
our
petition
must
be
taken
as
proof.
in
other
words,
we
think
we
should
be
permitted
to
bring
a
lawsuit
for
damages.
it
is
our
theory
that
the
restrictions
against
alienation
are
for
the
protection
of
the
indians.
that
the
united
states
will
not
permit
certain
indian
citizens
the
right
to
alienate
their
lands
but
that
restriction
if
your
honor
please,
goes
to
the
same
to
the
alienation
of
the
property.
it
is
our
position
and
we
submit
that
it
was
never
the
intention
of
the
congress
that
an
oil
and
gas
lessee
such
as
the
respondent
in
this
case
would
be
entitled
to
benefit
by
using
these
restrictions
against
the
indian
and
saying
that
the
indian
does
not
have
the
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
recover
what
he
thinks
he
is
entitled
to
receive
by
reason
of
a
breach
of
the
lease
contract.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
there
are
no
questions
about
that.
there
are
that
--
i
submit
that
there
is
no
question
about
it
as
i
interpret
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
right
sir.
and
that
is
the
same
situation
that
applies
in
any
number
of
different
matters
as
we
point
that
out
in
our
briefs.
but
i
do
not
believe
if
i
may
say,
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
determining
test.
the
test
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
intended
sale
or
alienation
of
the
property
that
is
when
the
federal
restriction
applied.
now,
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs.
there
are
some
language
in
the
early
decision,
the
heckman
case
that
of
this
court,
that
indicates
clearly
that
the
--
a
member
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
or
the
united
states
government
could
bring
a
lawsuit
pertaining
to
a
departmental
oil
and
gas
lease.
some
time
after
that
in
the
tenth
circuit,
there
was
a
case
seitz
versus
choctaw
and
chickasaw
nations.
in
that
case
reviews
of
all
the
authorities
were
set
out
in
that
opinion
that
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
and
the
tenth
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
squarely
held
that
either
the
indian
or
the
indian
tribe
or
the
united
states
could
bring
such
a
lawsuit
as
we
seek
the
right
to
bring
it
here.
now,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
in
this
case
based
to
its
decision
solely
on
the
question
of
these
restrictions
prevented
the
indian
from
bringing
this
suit.
skelly
oil
company
may
have
raised
two
or
three,
other
what
i
think,
at
least
to
be
interesting
question.
one
question
they
raise
is
they
say
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
could
have
decided
this
case
on
grounds
other
than
what
they
did
decided
on.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
inquiry
here.
i
think
that
when
the
opinion
of
the
states'
supreme
court
squarely
basing
it
this
decision
on
federal
regulations,
federal
laws
then
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
such
a
decision
were
sound
or
unsound.
there
is
another
interesting
matter,
at
least
to
me,
that
while
the
case
was
in
the
supreme
court,
skelly
oil
company
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
motion
to
dismiss
were
denied
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
however,
in
denying
the
appeal,
the
supreme
court
stated
that
in
the
future
a
different
rule
would
apply.
in
other
words,
skelly
oil
company
has
argued
that
because
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
their
lives
have
been
offended
under
the
federal
constitution
because
they
have
been
denied
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now,
this
court
in
the
great
northern
case
that
i
have
said
had
passed
squarely
on
that
question.
that
was
an
interesting
case,
if
your
honor
may
please
the
state
court
in
montana
have
ruled
and
adjudicated
the
question
about
tariffs
in
a
previous
decision
known
as
the
donnie
case
when
the
merit
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
again
in
the
great
northern
case.
the
supreme
court
of
montana
said,
“we're
going
to
overrule
the
donnie
case.
but
we're
going
to
apply
the
rule
in
the
donnie
case
to
the
great
northern
case
and
that
our
ruling
here
is
only
prospective.
this
court
in
that
case
held
that
such
a
decision
did
not
offend
the
rights
of
the
great
northern
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
it's
interesting
that
the
oklahoma
court
in
writing
its
opinion
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
followed
the
great
northern
decision.
i
have
referred
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
with
reference
to
the
position
of
the
united
states,
i
think
it's
very
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
solicitor
general
and
his
amicus
curiae
memorandum
clearly
sets
forth
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
administrative
remedies
mr.
cantrell
talked
about
is
applicable
only
to
the
cancellation
on
oil
and
gas
mining
lease
by
the
secretary
and
had
no
bearing
on
money
damages.
now,
we
don't
seek
cancellation
of
their
lease.
we
merely
sue
for
money
damages,
and
the
government
in
their
brief
in
its
conclusion
states
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
should
be
reversed.
i
merely
point
that
out
your
honor
because
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
the
same
position
that
we
take
that
there
is
no
adequate
administrative
remedy
and
consequently,
the
only
remedy
we
have
is
a
suit
in
court.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
sir?
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes
sir,
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes
sir
that
is
correct
sir.
and
i
said
out
in—very
briefly
in
my
reply
brief
where
the
sole
point
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
passed
on
in
its
syllabus
and
in
its
opinion
was
i'll
read
very
briefly
sir.
in
paragraph
six
of
the
lease
and
it's
provided
that
after
the
restrictions
are
removed,
the
lessor
shall
have
and
be
entitled
to
any
available
remedy
in
law
or
equity
for
breach
of
this
contract
by
the
lessee.
we
think
under
the
maxim
of
expression
unis
est
exclusio
alterius,
this
provision
deprives
the
lessor
of
the
right
to
prosecute
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
lease
contract
until
the
restrictions
are
removed.
and
that's
the
only
question.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
--
i
set
it
out
in
my
reply
brief
that
we
are
entitled,
we
submit,
to
have
the
oklahoma
court
pass
on
these
questions
of
venues
that
mr.
cantrell
argued
without
determining
this
court
on
federal
regulations,
federal
restrictions
alone.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
well,
if
i
might
suggest,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
my
view
is
that
the
supreme
court,
this
court
should
reverse
their
case
on
the
ground
that
an
incorrect
and
erroneous
construction
of
the
federal
statute
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
sir?
mr.
charles
hill
johns
i
reverse
it,
and
that
they
have
said,
the
oklahoma
court
has
said
that
an
indian
lessor
that
have
not
had
the
capacity
to
bring
this
period
for
lawsuit
anywhere
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
no,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
this
court
would
not.
it
would
then
go
back
to
the
oklahoma
court
and
let
us
argue
down
there
the
question
of
venue
before
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
i
am
convinced
they
were
correct.
i
am
convinced
the
venue
is
properly
laid
in
this
suit.
but
those
are
the
questions,
i
submit
to
the
court
is,
for
the
oklahoma
court.
that's
all.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
comanche
indians
residing
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
they
own
some

that
were

the
lands
are
restricted
against

under
the
general
allotment

these
indian
owners
are
permitted
to
make
an
oil
and
gas
lease.
but
the
oil
and
gas
lease
must
be
approved
by
the

of
the

they

skelly

filed

against
skelly

money

for
a

of
the

and
notified
the

invited
them
to
come

the
lawsuit.
they
did
not

a

a

which
is
comparable
to
the

it

the

in

held
by
reason
of
the
federal

against

these
indian

do
not
have
the

after
the
supreme
court
had
so
held

we
filed
an

at

the
case
is
here
as
the

on
a

sustained.
all
the

must
be
taken
as

in
other
words,
we
think
we
should
be
permitted

it
is

that
the

if

goes
to

mr.

mr.

mr.

yes,

there
are
no
questions
about
that.
there
are
that
--
i
submit
that
there
is
no
question
about
it
as
i
interpret
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
right
sir.
and
that
is
the
same
situation
that
applies
in
any
number
of
different
matters
as
we
point
that
out
in
our
briefs.
but
i
do
not
believe
if
i
may
say,
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
determining
test.
the
test
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
intended
sale
or
alienation
of
the
property
that
is
when
the
federal
restriction
applied.

in

from
bringing
this
suit.
skelly
oil
company
may
have
raised
two
or
three,
other
what
i
think,
at
least
to
be
interesting
question.
one
question
they
raise
is
they
say
the

court,
skelly
oil
company
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
motion
to
dismiss
were
denied
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
however,
in
denying
the
appeal,
the
supreme
court
stated
that
in
the
future
a
different
rule
would
apply.
in
other
words,
skelly
oil
company
has
argued
that
because
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
their
lives
have
been
offended
under
the
federal
constitution
because
they
have
been
denied
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now,
this
court
in
the
great
northern
case
that
i
have
said
had
passed
squarely
on
that
question.
that
was
an
interesting
case,
if
your
honor
may
please
the
state
court
in
montana
have
ruled
and
adjudicated
the
question
about
tariffs
in
a
previous
decision
known
as
the
donnie
case
when
the
merit
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
again
in
the
great
northern
case.
the
supreme
court
of
montana
said,
“we're
going
to
overrule
the
donnie
case.
but
we're
going
to
apply
the
rule
in
the
donnie
case
to
the
great
northern
case
and
that
our
ruling
here
is
only
prospective.
this
court
in
that
case
held
that
such
a
decision
did
not
offend
the
rights
of
the
great
northern
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
it's
interesting
that
the
oklahoma
court
in
writing
its
opinion
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
followed
the
great
northern
decision.
i
have
referred
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
with
reference
to
the
position
of
the
united
states,
i
think
it's
very
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
solicitor
general
and
his
amicus
curiae
memorandum
clearly
sets
forth
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
administrative
remedies
mr.
cantrell
talked
about
is
applicable
only
to
the
cancellation
on
oil
and
gas
mining
lease
by
the
secretary
and
had
no
bearing
on
money
damages.
now,
we
don't
seek
cancellation
of
their
lease.
we
merely
sue
for
money
damages,
and
the
government
in
their
brief
in
its
conclusion
states
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
should
be
reversed.
i
merely
point
that
out
your
honor
because
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
the
same
position
that
we
take
that
there
is
no
adequate
administrative
remedy
and
consequently,
the
only
remedy
we
have
is
a
suit
in
court.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
sir?
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes
sir,
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
yes
sir
that
is
correct
sir.
and
i
said
out
in—very
briefly
in
my
reply
brief
where
the
sole
point
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
passed
on
in
its
syllabus
and
in
its
opinion
was
i'll
read
very
briefly
sir.
in
paragraph
six
of
the
lease
and
it's
provided
that
after
the
restrictions
are
removed,
the
lessor
shall
have
and
be
entitled
to
any
available
remedy
in
law
or
equity
for
breach
of
this
contract
by
the
lessee.
we
think
under
the
maxim
of
expression
unis
est
exclusio
alterius,
this
provision
deprives
the
lessor
of
the
right
to
prosecute
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
lease
contract
until
the
restrictions
are
removed.
and
that's
the
only
question.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
--
i
set
it
out
in
my
reply
brief
that
we
are
entitled,
we
submit,
to
have
the
oklahoma
court
pass
on
these
questions
of
venues
that
mr.
cantrell
argued
without
determining
this
court
on
federal
regulations,
federal
restrictions
alone.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
well,
if
i
might
suggest,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
my
view
is
that
the
supreme
court,
this
court
should
reverse
their
case
on
the
ground
that
an
incorrect
and
erroneous
construction
of
the
federal
statute
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
--
mr.
charles
hill
johns
sir?
mr.
charles
hill
johns
i
reverse
it,
and
that
they
have
said,
the
oklahoma
court
has
said
that
an
indian
lessor
that
have
not
had
the
capacity
to
bring
this
period
for
lawsuit
anywhere
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
charles
hill
johns
no,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
this
court
would
not.
it
would
then
go
back
to
the
oklahoma
court
and
let
us
argue
down
there
the
question
of
venue
before
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
i
am
convinced
they
were
correct.
i
am
convinced
the
venue
is
properly
laid
in
this
suit.
but
those
are
the
questions,
i
submit
to
the
court
is,
for
the
oklahoma
court.
that's
all.
