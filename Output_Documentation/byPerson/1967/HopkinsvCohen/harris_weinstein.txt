mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is,
of
course,
a
--
presents
a
problem
of
statutory
construction
and
in
particular,
it
presents
the
problem
of
interpreting
one
word,
“claimant,”
in
the
sentence
from
section
206
(b)(1)
of
the
social
security
act
which
mr.
sharp
read
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
now,
i
shall
turn
to
that
language
in
a
moment
because
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
phraseology
of
that
language
makes
it
clear
that
congress,
by
the
word
“claimant,”
meant
“the
man
or
woman
or
child
who
appears
before
the
court
as
a
plaintiff
and
asks
that
court
to
enter
a
judgment
in
his
favor.”
but
perhaps,
in
view
of
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
and
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made,
it
would
be
useful
if
i
reviewed
briefly
the
history
of
attorney's
fees
in
these
cases,
both
in
an
administrative
and
judicial
level,
and
the
way
in
which
an
attorney
gets
into
the
case.
the
statute
contemplates,
i
think,
a
three-stage
procedure.
first,
there
is
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner.
and,
the
hearing
examiners,
as
i
understand
it,
so
to
speak,
ride
circuit.
they
go
out
to
various
parts
of
the
country
and
they
take
testimony
in
the
location
where
the
claimant
for
the
benefits
lives.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
as
mr.
sharp
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
believe
that's
the
way
it
works,
justice
brennan.
for
example,
the
--
this
case,
i
believe
that
the
hearing
took
place
in
a
post
office
building
in
danville,
illinois.
my
own
ignorance
of
the
geography
here
is
such
that
i
don't
know
how
far
that
means
the
--
that
mr.
hopkins
had
to
travel.
now,
mr.
hopkins
was
not
represented
at
that
hearing.
i
would
agree
with
the
arguments
of
counsel
who
have
represented
these
claimants
that
much
of
the
problem
here
and
much
of
the
litigation
has
probably
been
due
to
the
fact
that
counsel
had
not
appeared
at
these
hearings.
now,
mr.
hopkins,
i
assume,
received
a
form
document
that
goes
to
people
who
are
denied
benefits,
telling
them
their
rights
to
a
hearing,
of
their
rights
to
have
counsel.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
where
a
man
is
illiterate
or
ill-educated
it
may
not
do
the
most
good
to
get
--
send
him
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
“you
can
have
a
counsel.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
before
--
my
understanding
of
the
procedures,
which
is
not
precise
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
would
assume
that's
right
and
i
--
if
there
is
a
procedure
for
appointment
of
counsel
or
making
available
counsel
under
the
programs
of
the
neighborhood
legal
services
program
i'm
unfamiliar
with.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i'm
sure
that
would
be
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
know
of
no
arrangement
for
the
government
to
provide
at
these
hearings
a
man
whose
specific
mission
is
to
represent
the
claimant.
well,
if
we
--
the
second
stage
of
administrative
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
a
practical
matter,
it
may
be.
as
a
legal
matter,
it
is
not
and
in
this
case,
it
was
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
because
if
relief
is
denied
at
that
point,
there
is
an
appellate
body
in
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
conducts
a
hearing
on
that
record
if
it
is
requested,
but
i
also
understand
there
is
a
procedure
to
supplement
that
record
and
i
believe
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
finally
determined
a
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
believe,
justice
fortas,
that
the
department
of
justice
sees
these
cases
until
they
arrive
at
the
stage
of
litigation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
know.
i'd
be
happy
to
determine
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
this
--
you
mean
the
employer
of
this
man?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
an
--
there
are
hernia
problem
involved,
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
came
out
of
an
on
the
job
injury,
but
the
employer
would
not
have
a
financial
interest
because
i
believe
the
scheme
of
this
benefit
is
that
if
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
is
not.
it's
a
payment
that
comes
because
of
what
has
been
paid
in
the
past
into
the
social
security
trust
funds
on
account
of
this
man's
past
employment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
well,
at
the
appellate
level
and
the
administrative
appellate
level,
the
man
may
also
be
represented
and,
in
this
particular
case,
i
believe
that
that
is
where
mr.
sharp
entered
the
case
and
i
believe
that
what
happened
is
he
filed
a
written
brief.
he
did
not
request
an
actual
appearance
before
the
appellate
tribunal.
he
offered,
i
believe,
some
additional
records
in
the
way
of
medical
testimony,
and
this
medical
testimony
together
with
the
transcript
developed
before
the
hearing
examiner
became
the
record
at
the
district
court
level.
now,
until
the
statute
was
changed
and
this
january
effective
this
summer,
compensation
at
--
for
attorney's
appearances
at
these
administrative
proceedings
was
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
he
could
allow
such
fee
as
he
saw
fit.
part
of
the
problems
here
began
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
and
this
is
the
function
of
this
recent
legislation,
that
it
allows
a
withholding
from
the
award
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
technically,
he
can
provide
a
fee
to
be
paid
by
the
claimant
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
there's
no
way
of
paying
it
out
of
the
public
money.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that's
correct.
it's
for
benefits
under
insurance
policy
where
he's
paid
the
premiums
or
they've
been
paid
on
his
behalf.
but,
there's
a
countervailing
consideration
which
i
think
appears
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
justice
fortas,
which
is
the
concern
of
the
congress
that
contingent
fee
arrangements
being
used
in
district
courts
were
allowing
fees
that
were
so
large
that
they
were
internally
eating
into
these
people's
benefits,
but
the
statute
before
this
january
allowed
fees
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
at
one
time,
the
secretary
had
a
regulation
saying
that
the
fees
would
be
very
limited
unless
special
application
was
made,
and
these
were
amounts
i
think
that
vary
from
$10-$50
and
i
think
it's
in
connection
with
those
limitations
that
are
not
in
effect
now,
that
much
of
the
language
in
district
court
opinions
critical
of
the
secretary's
position
was
written.
the
statute,
as
presently
drafted
for
administrative
proceedings,
allows
a
withholding
from
the
past-due
benefits
to
be
paid
directly
to
the
attorney.
under
the
prior
proceeding
--
under
the
prior
statute,
when
the
proceedings
were
simply
administrative,
the
secretary
would
establish
a
fee.
it
was
a
misdemeanor
to
collect
a
higher
fee
than
that
one,
but
the
lawyer
was
left
to
his
own
devices
to
collect
the
fee
from
the
client.
the
major
change
in
the
new
statute,
as
i
see
it,
is
to
set
for
a
withholding
scheme
up
to
25%
of
the
maximum
benefit
at
the
administrative
level.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think,
on
that
one
is--
in
that
respect,
is
indistinguishable
from
the
one
we
have
here.
there's
a
difference,
however,
because
the
new
statute
for
administrative
fees
has
several
alternatives
and
it
would
not
appear
that
the
25%
limitation
is
a
firm
limit.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
as
the
court
adjourned,
i
was
reviewing
briefly
the
administrative
procedures
followed
by
someone
who
has
applied
for
and
been
denied
social
security
benefits.
to
summarize
them
quickly,
there
are
essentially
two
steps
in
the
administrative
procedure:
a
hearing
examiner
and
appeals
council.
there's
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
at
both
stages.
there's
an
opportunity
for
counsel
at
both
stages.
in
fact,
as
the
record
in
the
district
court
here
showed,
mr.
hopkins
in
this
case
was
represented
for
the
first
time
at
the
appeal
stage,
although
he
had
written
notice
at
least
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
lower
stage
and
he
did
testify
at
the
hearing
that
he
could
read.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct.
there
are
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
was
interested
to
learn
last
night
from
the
annual
report
of
the
legal
services
program
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
that,
in
the
most
recent
fiscal
year,
they
provided
assistance
to
something
over
3,000,
i
think
the
number
was
3,200,
applicants.
and,
while
the
statistics
don't
show
the
stage
which
that
occurred,
i
would
infer
that
it
occurred
at
some
administrative
level
since
the
number
of
pending
court
cases
don't,
i
think,
reach
that
number.
but,
there
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
3,000
for
the
whole
country
and
oeo,
and
i
don't
know
how
it
breaks
down
geographically.
mr.
harris
weinstein
under
social
security
generally.
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
them
with
disability,
how
many
were
old
age
or
survivors,
but
i--
the
number
was
3,200-and
something.
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
neighborhood
legal
services
program
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
the
line
in
their
report,
just
listing
on
categories
of
welfare
problems,
lists
social
security
matter
or
something
of
that
euchring
gives
a
number
like
3,200
cases
during
a
fiscal
year.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
would
not
hazard
to
guess
on
which
happened.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
say
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think,
certainly,
it
is
and
i
think
that
what
i
have
been
able
to
uncover
since
yesterday
is,
for
example,
instructions
to
personnel
and
the
field
officers
of
the
social
security
administration.
and,
there's
a
paragraph
of
instruction
that
is
called
“explaining
hearing,”
and
they
are
told
to
give
the
applicant
who
is
dissatisfied
with
what's
been
done
with
his
initial
application
oral
advice
together
with
the
written
advice
about
what
his
rights
are.
and,
one
of
the
sentences
in
that
states
as
follows:
inform
him
that
a
hearing
is
a
semiformal
proceeding
before
a
hearing
examiner
wherein
he
may
present
evidence,
witnesses,
and
oral
or
written
arguments
and
may
appear
with
an
attorney
or
other
representative.
the
statute,
by
the
way,
makes
allowance
for
representation
by
non-attorneys.
and,
also
in
the
instruction,
it
tells
the
employee
of
the
department
to
follow
in
the
oral
presentation
a
booklet
that
is
entitled
“right
to
appeal”
that
i
would
presume
is
also
given
to
the
applicant
and
describes
generally
what
the
review
procedures
are.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
an
appeals
council
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
here
in
washington.
as
with
most
administrative
appellate
hearings,
the
usual
course
is
to
review
on
the
papers.
the
applicant,
if
he
wants
to,
may
request
a
personal
appearance
of
himself
or
by
his
attorney.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
only
the
hearings,
justice
brennan.
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
we
could
certainly
launch
them.
mr.
harris
weinstein
while
i
would
assume
the
former,
i
don't
know
and,
if
the
court
would
wish,
i
would
inform
the
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
will
do
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
only
knowledge
on
that
goes
to
the
procedures
for,
if
any,
for
reviewing
attorney's
fees
granted
by
the
administrators
for
representation
at
the
administrative
levels.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
answer
that,
justice
fortas.
we
did
not
brief
that
point
since
the
point
--
since
the
issues
did
go
to
the
legal
fees
allowable
in
district
courts,
but
we'd
be
happy
to
provide
the
court
with
that
information
in
a
supplemental
document.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
now,
there
are
three
possible
determinations,
justice
brennan.
one
is
to
affirm,
one
is
to
reverse,
and
one
is
to
remand
to
take
more
evidence
or
for
reconsideration
in
the
administrative
level.
and
so,
the
record
wallet
is
closed
for
purposes
of
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
may
direct
a
reopening
of
the
record.
mr.
harris
weinstein
to
the
factual
part
of
it.
of
course,
i
think
that
a
large
measure
of
the
litigation
that's
taken
place
over
the
last
five
or
seven
years
has
gone
to
the
legal
standards
in
this
area
determining
disability
and
the
courts,
i
think,
showed
a
rather
short
disagreement,
at
least
in
some
circuits,
with
the
agency's
interpretation.
now,
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
pending,
but
this
was
resolved
by
congress
in
the
recent
act
which,
i
believe,
in
section
158
(b)
of
the
act
became
effective
january
2
of
this
year
overruled
the
court's
that
had
disagreed
with
the
agency's
interpretation
of
disability.
and
so,
i
think
it's
hard
to
gauge
or
really
to
say
that
the
factual
determinations
have
been
largely
dispositive
because
there
has
been
this
legal
dispute
and,
as
i
say,
that
it
had
resulted
in
a
split
among
the
circuits
that
congress
has
now
resolved.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
the
--
yesterday
that
the
hearings
had
been
brought
to
this
court.
now,
i've
checked
this
morning
and
found
that,
although
they
are
in
the
record
of
the
district
court,
they
had
not
been
brought
forward
on
appeal
because
the
issues
had
gone
solely
to
the
maximum
attorney's
fees
and
i,
with
permission
of
the
other
side,
i
assume
we
could
have
this
sent
forward
to
this
court.
what
it
shows
is
a
record
of
129
pages,
including
transcript,
exhibits,
the
hearing
examiner's
written
decision,
the
appeal
counsel's
refusal
to
go
further
while
looking
at
additional
evidence,
the
brief
that
mr.
sharp
submitted
to
the
appeals
counsel,
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
i
understand
that
as
a
matter
of
course
this
type
of
booklet
or
exhibit
would
be
attached
to
the
agency's
answer
to
the
complaint
to
the
district
court.
now,
this
particular
transcript
shows
55
typed
pages
of
evidence
at
a
hearing
lasting
perhaps
two
hours,
but
there
is
the
same
type
of
transcript
that
one
would
have
in
a
court
proceeding.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
question,
i
think,
is
even
more
limited
than
that,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
the
maximum
amount
of
the
fee
that
a
district
court
can
direct
for
representation
before
that
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
right.
there's
no
contention
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
inadequacy
of
procedure
or
any
inadequacy
of
representation
and,
in
fact,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
decisions--
the
earlier
court
decisions
suggest
that.
for
example,
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
have
each,
in
earlier
cases,
gone
over
records
where
the
applicant
was
not--

examiner

and,
if

and

f.2d.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
black,
and
we
reach
this
i
think
on
a
two-pronged
argument,
one
on
the
basis
of
the--
what
the
committee
report
says
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
and
the
other
is
on
our
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
legislation
arouse
at--
after
a
time
when
the
courts
had
adopted
the
practice
of
approving
fees
in
these
cases,
generally
according
to
contingent
fee
arrangements
that
the
applicant
had
entered
into
with
his
counsel,
often
going
as
high
as
30%
or
40%
or
50%
of
past-due
benefits,
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
legislation
was
introduced
and
we
think
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
back
on
this
court
practice.
and,
the
committee
report
which
we've
set
forth
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief
has
the
following
act.
it
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
that
attorneys
have,
upon
occasion,
charged
what
appear
to
be
inordinately
large
fees
for
representing
claimants
in
federal
district
court
actions
arising
under
the
social
security
program.
usually,
these
large
fees
result
from
a
contingent
fee
arrangement,
under
which
the
attorney
is
entitled
to
a
percentage
frequently
one-third
to
one-half
of
the
approved
benefits.
since
litigation
necessarily
involves
a
considerable
lapse
of
time,
in
many
cases
large
amounts
of
accrued
benefits,
and
consequently
large
legal
fees
are
payable
if
the
claimant
wins
his
case.
and
then,
there's
a
sentence
that
we
quote
that,
like
the
two
sentences
that
mr.
sharp
referred
to
yesterday,
paraphrase
the
statute.
and
--
but
from
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can
only
speak
with
precision
to
the
one
in
this
case,
justice
harlan,
and
that
was
signed
by
both,
i
believe,
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins.
and
that
probably,
it
went
to
both.
i
don't
recall
the
precise
language.
let's
--
i
think
that
the
language
is,
at
best,
ambiguous.
it
says
that
mr.
sharp
isn't
hired
to
prosecute
his
claim,
referring
to
mr.
hopkins,
but
then
the
document
is
signed
by
both
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
believe
so
if
it
takes
place
with
respect
to
court
proceedings.
when
the
fee
is
charged
for
proceedings
before
the
agency,
then
it
has
to
be
subjected
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
it's
a
misdemeanor
to
charge
more
than
he
approves.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there
was
a
wife
and
two
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
document,
on
its
face,
i
think
is
silent.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
document,
on
its
face,
i
believe
is
silent.
i
don't--
i
do
not
see
the
names
of
the
children
and,
although
it
does
say
that
the
contract
is
between
mr.
and
mrs.
hopkins
and
mr.
sharp.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
he
surely
sits
there
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
surely
ma--
sits
there
to
make
a
decision
and
he
does
give
--
render
a
written
decision.
i
don't
know
and
if
in
terms
of
his
instructions
or
the
secretary's
conception
of
the
hearing
examiner's
role
to
what
extent
he
is
expected
to
seek
out
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
claimant,
but
we
would
certainly
include
this
information
in
what
we
would
provide
the
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
do
not
think
that
there's
been
any
contention
that
these
proceedings
have,
in
a
general
way,
been
unfair
to
claimants.
mr.
harris
weinstein
even
when
there
has
been
no
counsel
present.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
alright,
sir.
in
view
of
this
legislative
history
which
was
least
intended
to
cut
back
the
fees
then
being
approved
and
paid
through
court
actions,
the
congress
adopted
section
206
(b)(1)
of
the
statute,
using
the
word
“claimant.”
and,
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
the
very
narrow
question
of
interpretation
in
this
case
and
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
comes
down
to
what
does
the
word
“claimant”
mean
in
this
statute
and
we
suggest,
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation,
there
are
several
clauses
in
the
statute
that
modify
the
word
“claimant”
and
conclusively
define
it
in
a
way
that
can
mean
only
the
plaintiff
who
happens
to
be
before
the
court
in
that
case,
that
is
the
head
of
the
family
in
this
case,
mr.
hopkins,
and
that
it
does
not
include
anybody
else.
we
begin
this
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
statute
with
the
first
phrase.
the
statute
begins,
“whenever
a
court
renders
a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant
under
this
subchapter,”
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language,
“a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant”
is
something
that
ordinarily
would
refer
to
a
plaintiff
before
a
court.
he's
the
person
on
whose
behalf
and
whose
favor
a
judgment
is
rendered.
then,
the
statute
goes
on
to
speak
of
“claimant
under
this
subchapter
who
was
represented
before
the
court
by
an
attorney,”
and
we
suggest
that
there
are
two
points
in
that
phraseology.
first,
the
language
“before
the
court.”
it
suggests
the
claimant
is
the
person
who
is
before
the
court,
the
person
who
is
a
party.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
have
a
justiciable
controversy
with
the
secretary,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
could
certainly
join
as
parties.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
have
a
derivative
controversy
but
if,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
secretary
agreed
that
the
dependants
qualified
for
benefits,
if
the
principal
claimant
benef
--
qualified,
they
would
have
no
controversy.
they
would
be
allowed
to
come
into
court
under
the
statute
to
represent
the
principal
claimant
if
they
wanted
to.
they
could
--
they
are
essentially
given
standing
to
assert
his
rights
on
his
behalf,
but
they
would
still
not
be
the
claimant
represented
before
the
court
on
whose
behalf
a
favorable
judgment
is
entered.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
in
this
court
action,
and
the
claims
for
the
wife
and
children
are
in
separate
documents.
the
checks
for
the
entire
family
come
in
two
separate
amounts:
one
for
the
children,
and
one
for
the
husband
and
wife
together.
mr.
harris
weinstein
which
in
--
sir,
involved
only
the
father,
mr.
hopkins.
there
has
been
no
administrative
denial
of
the
rights
of
the
dependants.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct.
that's
the
only
pers
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
had
been
a
crane
operator,
i
believe.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
grade
school
education.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
only
thing
that
he
could've
been
saying
is
his
rights.
his
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
children
and
wife's
status
as
dependants
have
previously
been
approved.
the
termination
of
the
benefits
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
this
case
they
would
be,
justice
fortas.
and,
a
ques
--
but
i
think
the
word
“claim,”
to
begin
with,
is
a
case
that
has
a
generally
accepted
meaning
in
the
law.
the
claim
the
formal
--
listed
on
the
formal
request
for
hearing
here,
the
claim
given
in
the
caption
of
the
transcript
was
only
the
case
of
raymond
hopkins
and
the
question
whether
he
himself
was
disabled.
now
there
are
two
--
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
here
that
there
are
two
ways
procedurally
in
which
the
dependant's
claims
can
be
disposed
of.
in
this
case,
it
happened
that
the
dependant
status
was
approved
before
mr.
hopkins'
own
claims
were
terminated,
so
that
they
were
all
approved.
they
were
all
receiving
claims.
they
were
all
receiving
benefits
on
their
original
claim.
all
benefits
were
then
terminated
because
the
--
in
the
secretary's
view,
mr.
hopkins'
disability
had
terminated.
when
the
court
directed
the
secretary
to
resume
mr.
hopkins'
benefits
by
finding
that
he
was
disabled,
the
result
was
the
secretary
knew
that
mrs.
hopkins
was
indeed
the
wife
of
mr.
hopkins,
that
there
were
these
children,
that
they
all
satisfy
the
necessary
requirements
of
age
to
quo
--
the
statute
establishes
and,
therefore,
mr.
sharp
could
say
that,
in
this
case,
it
followed
automatically
that
the
benefits
were
resumed.
but,
another
case
that
could
equally
arise
would
be
saying
the
circumstances
where
the
secretary
found
at
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
no
disability.
therefore,
the
secretary
would
not
ordinarily
have
reached
the
claim
of
the
dependants.
he
wouldn't
have
determined
whether
there
was
a
marital
relationship.
he
wouldn't
have
determined
whether
the
claimants
satisfy
the
requirements
of
age.
in
that
situation,
the
judgment
in
favor
of
mr.
hopkins
would've
only
established
one
of
three
essential
facts
and
two
would
not
yet
been
established.
they
couldn't
be
litigated
in
the
court
as
a
claim
in
the
court
until
mrs.
hopkins
and
the
children
had
gone
through
the
administrative
procedures.
presumably,
they
would
benefit
and
the
secretary
would
have
reached
the
same
determination
and
allow
the
claims
administratively
with
no
need
for
asserting
a
dispute.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
reason
why
he
could
not,
justice
harlan,
to
the
extent
that
he
charged
a
fee
to
the
dependants
for
administrative
proceedings.
he
would
have
to
have
that
fee
approved
by
the
secretary.
but,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
approved,
he
could
collect
it.
he
could
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
up
to
--
under
the
new
legislation,
which
i've
misspoken
myself
yesterday,
it
is
effective
now.
it
is
not
postponed
until
this
summer.
he
could
--
when
the
fee
is
approved
by
the
secretary,
it
would
be
to
the
extent
of
25%
of
the
past-due
benefits.
it
would
be
withheld
from
the
fund
that
the
secretary
had.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
statute
does
--
no
way
speaks
to
disbursements
or
expenses,
and
our
assumption
is
that
they're
allowable
in
addition
to
the
fee,
although
they
might
not
be
collectable
out
of
the
sum,
but
the
law--
as
we
read
the
statute,
the
lawyer
legally
can
collect
his
disbursements
in
addition
to
this
fee
and
could
collect
them
directly
from
beneficiaries.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
might
--
i
don't
know
the
status,
say,
of
a
separated
wife.
i
assume
she'll
be
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
except
--
i
don't
know
the
precise
answer
to
that,
justice
black.
i
think
she
is.
certainly,
say,
a
child
who
is
a
student
and
under
the
age
of,
i
think,
22
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
22,
is
entitled
to
benefits
and
the
children's
checks,
as
this
record
shows,
whatever
he
age
of
the
children,
those
amounts
come
in
a
separate
check.
mr.
harris
weinstein
addressed
to
the
children.
now,
i
assume,
for
minor
children,
they
go
to
the
parent
as
guardian,
but
this
record
in
the
letter
from
the
social
security
administration
shows
that
they
will
--
the
checks
come
in
two
separate
amounts:
one
to
mother
and
father,
one
for
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
there
is
a
disability,
this
agency.
this
particular
claim
here
is
a
claim
for
disabling
injury
to
the
husband.
mr.
harris
weinstein
for
a
disabling
injury
to
the
--
i
do
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
work
connected.
it
does
not
have
to
be,
but
it
hinges
on
this
--
the
fact
of
disability.
i
think
there
is
also
an
additional
matter
in
the
statute
that
helps
us
define
a
claim
because
the
statute
speaks
of
the
limit
on
a
fee
for
such
representation,
and
such
representation
refers
back
to
the
representation
before
the
court
of
the
claimant.
and,
the
statute
goes
on
to
s
--
in
setting
the
maximum
amount
of
the
fee,
says
that
it
shall
not
be
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
claimant
is
entitled
by
reason
of
such
judgment.
now,
here
again,
we
suggest
that
the
word
“entitled”
is
a
word
with
a
distinct
legal
meaning.
it
should
mean
claim
of
right
and
the
claimant,
in
this
case
mr.
hopkins,
is
the
only
person
who
has
a
fixed
claim
of
right
by
reason
of
the
court's
judgment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
prove
additional
facts
that
were
not
liti
--
in
controversy
before
the
court.
the
court's
judgment
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
they
are
the
children
and
they
are
the
appropriate
age.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
then,
to
determine
the
amount
to
which
they're
entitled,
they
may
have
to
show
something
about
whether
they
have
other
income.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
claimants
but
they
are
not
the
claimant
before
the
court,
i
would
suggest,
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
not,
justice
black.
they
may
or
may
not
be.
if
the
claim
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
are
in
fact
decided
together,
if
they
do
in
fact
litigate
together
in
the
district
court,
then
the
attorney's
fee,
if
he
represents
them
all,
can
be
measured
by
the
total
amount
of
the
benefits
that
they
all
secure
by
reason
of
the
court
judgment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry,
sir.
perhaps
that's
because
in
the
ordinary
case
the
only
matter
that
is
litigated
before
the
court
is
the
bro
--
the
claim
of
the,
as
in
this
case,
the
father
of
one
claimant.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
it's
as
simple
as
that,
justice
brennan,
because
i
assume
they
have
to
have
a
justiciable
controversy
and
they
have
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
depend
on
a
finding
of
disability,
a
finding
of
relationship,
and
a
finding
of
age.
mr.
harris
weinstein
wherever
the
secretary
disputed
the
relationship
or
the
age.
the
--
first,
this
type
of
litigation
in
itself
represents
perhaps
3%
of
all
social
security
claims,
but
there
are
a
variety
of
cases
where,
say,
the
relationship
of
parent
and
child
might
dis--
be
disputed.
one
example
of
that
the
court
might
be
interested
in
is
a
case
called
chernack
in
360
f.2d,
i
don't
recall
the
page
citation,
where
the
question
was
whether
there
had
--
this
was
a
widow's
claim
for
benefits
that
was
allowed.
and
then,
there
was
a
child.
it
was
the
father's
child
but
not
the
mother's
child,
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
child
had
been
adopted
before
death
of
the
father
and,
therefore,
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
statute.
but,
there
could
be
this
kind
of
controversy.
there
are
controversies
as
to
whether
there's
a
marriage.
if
they
don't
all
come
together
in
one
case
at
the
same
time,
they
will
not
all
come
before
the
court
at
the
same
time.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
were
not,
justice
black.
in
this
case,
the
secretary
had
no
disagreement
with
the
proposition
that
mrs.
hopkins
was
a
lawful
wife,
these
children
were
at
the
proper
age
to
collect
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
suggest
this,
justice
fortas,
that
the
statute
--
the
statutory
terms,
i
don't
think,
can
be
read
one
way
for
this
kind
of
case
where
the
secretary
is
in
an
--
in
advanced
higher
--
agreed
that
the
wi
--
the
woman
and
children
are
the
wife
and
children
of
the
proper
age
and,
yet,
a
different
reading
be
reserved
for
the
case
that
would
have
arisen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
our
disagreement
is
in
terms
of
whether
or
what
is
the
significance
of
the
phraseology
that
congress
has
used,
and
congress
has
spoken
of
the
person
before
the
court
who
becomes
entitled
to
something
by
reason
of
the
judgment.
and,
in
terms
of
the
significance
of
the
contingent
fee
arrangement,
our
understanding
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
was
quite
dissatisfied
with
the
court-approved
contingent
fee
arrangements
and
that
congress
was
trying
to
put
on
the
courts
the
responsibility
of
approving
fees
within
a
fixed
limit
that
did
not
eat
into
the
award
to
the
claimants.
now,
i
think
one
consequence
of
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
one
was
from
the
committee
report
in
the
statute
by
statute
anal
--
the
section
by
section
analysis.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know.
i'm
sure
there
are
a
number.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but,
i
would
al
--
the
statute,
that
language
and
the
statement
of
mr.
mills
on
the
floor
is
not
significantly
different
from
the
committee
language
that
we've
set
forth.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
our
disagreement,
justice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
anything
like
this,
any
claims
of
this
nature
or
litigation
of
this
nature
under
fela.
in
our
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
one
difference
is
that,
in
this
case,
the
claims
are
not
always
or
usually
litigated
together
because
a
controversy
may
only
go
to
one
part
of
the
claim
or
any
controversy,
say,
the
children
might
have
might
be
resolved
at
the
administrative
rather
than
in
the
courts
--
at
the
court
level.
and,
i
think
that
one
consequence
of
the
--
what
i
would
call
the
broader
reading
of
the
statute
for
which
the
petitioners
argue
is
that
where
there
is
a
separate
controversy
between
the
wife
and
the
secretary
where
she
proceeds
differently
in
the
administrative
process,
where
as
--
if
25%
of
her
funds
have
been
paid
to
the
lawyer
who
represented
her
husband,
where
--
from
where
is
the
secretary
going
to
satisfy
the
fee
that
the
statute
tells
him
to
allow
to
whoever
represents
the
wife.
now,
i
think
what
the
statute
does
is
give
the
wife
and
the
children
and
the
husband
their
options.
each
can
or
cannot
hire
a
lawyer
to
present
their
particular
facts.
the
husband
can
hire
a
lawyer
to
present
his
facts
on
issue
of
disability.
then,
the
wife
and
the
children
can
determine
whether
it's
worthwhile
to
pay
additional
money
to
have
a
lawyer
present
the
question
of
whether
they
are
wife
and
children
and
whether
they
are
of
the
appropriate
ages.
and
if
--
if
they
choose
to
present
that
controversy
through
a
lawyer,
then
there
ought
to
be,
and
congress
in
the
recent
legislation
contemplated
that
there
would
be,
funds
left
to
pay
that
lawyer
to
encourage
him
to
come
in.
the
--
if,
on
the
other
hand,
they
ch
--
decide
that
these
facts
are
so
clear
and
simple,
as
they
apparently
were
in
this
case,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
congress
has
taken
the
view
of
not
requiring
them
to
pay
a
lawyer
because
these
facts
aren't
subject
to
controversy.
now,
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
it
is
fixing
at
maximum
fee.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
it's
true,
justice
harlan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
think
it's
true,
justice
harlan,
that
their
case
to
a
very
great
extent
depends
on
the
proposition
that
the
reading
that
we
intend
for
results
in
fees
that
are
too
low.
now,
of
course,
one
consequence
of
their
reading,
i
imagine,
would
be
that
single
claimants
would
never
be
represented
because
it
would
follow
from
their
reading
that
the
fee
for
representing
a
bachelor
or
a
widow
or
a
widower
would
be
less
than
half
of
the
fee
for
representing
somebody
who
was
married
with
two
children
even
though
the
controversy
might
be
of
the
same
nature.
but,
beyond
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
the
contention
--
let's
say
that
the
representation
would
be
inhibited,
justice
stewart.
their
argument
is
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
their
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
fees
under
the
reading
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
have
such
a
low
limit
that
it
is
not
economic
for
attorneys
to
take
these
cases,
that
they
need
the
higher
limit
for
the
cases
to
be
economic.
if
that's
correct,
the
lower
limit
that
they
say
is
inadequate
will
always
apply
unless
they
are
dependants.
i'm
assuming,
by
their
argument,
that
this
would
inhibit
at
least
the
representation
of
single
people
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
result
that
congress
likely
wanted
to
bring
about.
but,
beyond
that,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
amount
of
fees
that
had
been
allowed
here,
if
you
compare
it
to
the
amount
of
work
that
is
ordinarily
involved
and
fees
allowed
in
other
situations,
that
it
--
that
you'd
--
it
appears
that
this
argument
is
not
one
that
is
clearly
right.
it's
not
one
that
is
clearly
wrong
and
it's
one
that
belongs
in
congress
if
it
hasn't
already
been
lost
there.
these
fees
here
are
only
for
representation
in
court.
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
representation
before
the
secretary,
the
lawyer
can't
go
to
the
secretary
and
apply
for
a
separate
fee.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
of
approval.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
right,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there
had
been
some
cases,
for
example,
where
there'd
been
a
court
proceeding
followed
by
a
remand.
i
believe
the
courts
have
contemplated
a
fee
from
the
secretary
for
his
--
for
the
work
there
in
front
of
the
courts
because
--
but
as
--
we
have
collected
some
statistics
which
we
set
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
and
the
median
fee
for
these
representations,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
has
been
running
$800.00
or
$900.00
for
a
proceeding
that
is
limited
essentially
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
preexisting
record.
the
fourth
circuit,
which
has
taken
what
it
considers
a
broader
reading
and
what
it
says
it
is
rejecting
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute,
has
so
far
refused
to
allow
a
fee
as
high
as
the
petitioners
argue
for.
in
fact,
most
recently,
the
case
of
redden,
i
believe
it
is,
where
the
fourth
circuit
originally
rendered
the
decision
that
resulted
in
the
conflict
with
this
case
was
back
into
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
allowance
of
the
fee
and
the
district
court
had
allowed
a
fee
of
25%
of
the
$16,000-benefits
payable
to
the
whole
family.
and,
the
fourth
circuit
said
this
is
just
too
high
and
they
cut
it
back
to
something
around
2,200
and
the
25%
of
the
--
only
the
father's
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
surely.
but
i
--
the
point
it
would
like
to
make,
justice
black,
is
that
the
courts
that
have
adopted
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
have
not
agreed
so
far
that
higher
fees
are
necessary
to
secure
adequate
representation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
justice
harlan,
that
there's
no
question
about
the
court's
exercising
discretion.
the
problem
is
the
limits
within
which
that
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
and,
as
--
for
the
reason
we've
pointed
out,
we
would
urge
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
hope
not
and
the
courts,
at
least
the
court
circuit,
has
not
--
we
would
agree,
has
not
done
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
that's
certainly
right,
justice
stewart,
and
we
would
assume
that
these
are
the
factors
that
congress
also
kept
in
mind
in
establishing
this
limit.
and,
for
the
reasons
we've
set
forth,
we
believe
that
limit
is
as
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
said.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
white?
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
with
--
it
precludes
him
from
collecting
privately
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
in
section
206
(a)
of
the
statute
which
is
section
406
(a)
in
the
us
code
and,
it
allows
the
--
together
with
the
amendments
that
went
into
force
this
january,
it
allows
the
secretary
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
governing
fees.
it
directs
him
to
allow
a
fee
to
any
representative
which
presumably
a
lawyer
could
be
if
he
prosecuted
the
wife's
claim
before
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
statute
is
clear
that
with
--
unless
it's
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary,
it
is
a
misdemeanor,
but
there's
no
--
if
i
may
take
another
moment?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
the
secretary
is
parsimonious
in
these
matters,
although
this
is
again
a
matter
for,
i
would
think,
for
the
congress.
the
--
our
review
of
the
fees,
which
is
not
in
the
brief,
indicates
that
the
secretary,
in
the
last
several
years,
each
year
allows
several
hundred
fees.
i
think,
in
the
calendar
of
1966
there
were
over
800.
a
majority
of
them
are
under
$500.00.
on
the
other
hand,
a
good
number
of
them
range
from
500
and
some
much
as
high
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
as
2,000.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
limitation
on
the
total
fee
to
the
family.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
would
be
in
section
206
(b)(2),
the
immediately
following
subsection
which
i
don't
believe
that
anybody
has
printed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
we
read
the
new
statute.
it
--
the
25%
limit
is
on
the
withholding.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but,
the
statute
says
that
the
withholding
from
the
accrued
benefits
shall
be
the
lesser
of
the
fee
approved
by
the
secretary
or
25%
or
the
contingent
fee,
and
i
assume
that
means
that
the
approved
fee
could
be
higher
than
25%.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is,
of
course,
a
--
presents
a
problem
of
statutory
construction
and
in
particular,
it
presents
the
problem
of
interpreting
one
word,
“claimant,”
in
the
sentence
from
section
206
(b)(1)
of
the
social
security
act
which
mr.
sharp
read
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
now,
i
shall
turn
to
that
language
in
a
moment
because
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
phraseology
of
that
language
makes
it
clear
that
congress,
by
the
word
“claimant,”
meant
“the
man
or
woman
or
child
who
appears
before
the
court
as
a
plaintiff
and
asks
that
court
to
enter
a
judgment
in
his
favor.”
but
perhaps,
in
view
of
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
and
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made,
it
would
be
useful
if
i
reviewed
briefly
the
history
of
attorney's
fees
in
these
cases,
both
in
an
administrative
and
judicial
level,
and
the
way
in
which
an
attorney
gets
into
the
case.
the
statute
contemplates,
i
think,
a
three-stage
procedure.
first,
there
is
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner.
and,
the
hearing
examiners,
as
i
understand
it,
so
to
speak,
ride
circuit.
they
go
out
to
various
parts
of
the
country
and
they
take
testimony
in
the
location
where
the
claimant
for
the
benefits
lives.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
as
mr.
sharp
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
believe
that's
the
way
it
works,
justice
brennan.
for
example,
the
--
this
case,
i
believe
that
the
hearing
took
place
in
a
post
office
building
in
danville,
illinois.
my
own
ignorance
of
the
geography
here
is
such
that
i
don't
know
how
far
that
means
the
--
that
mr.
hopkins
had
to
travel.
now,
mr.
hopkins
was
not
represented
at
that
hearing.
i
would
agree
with
the
arguments
of
counsel
who
have
represented
these
claimants
that
much
of
the
problem
here
and
much
of
the
litigation
has
probably
been
due
to
the
fact
that
counsel
had
not
appeared
at
these
hearings.
now,
mr.
hopkins,
i
assume,
received
a
form
document
that
goes
to
people
who
are
denied
benefits,
telling
them
their
rights
to
a
hearing,
of
their
rights
to
have
counsel.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
where
a
man
is
illiterate
or
ill-educated
it
may
not
do
the
most
good
to
get
--
send
him
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
“you
can
have
a
counsel.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
before
--
my
understanding
of
the
procedures,
which
is
not
precise
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
would
assume
that's
right
and
i
--
if
there
is
a
procedure
for
appointment
of
counsel
or
making
available
counsel
under
the
programs
of
the
neighborhood
legal
services
program
i'm
unfamiliar
with.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i'm
sure
that
would
be
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
know
of
no
arrangement
for
the
government
to
provide
at
these
hearings
a
man
whose
specific
mission
is
to
represent
the
claimant.
well,
if
we
--
the
second
stage
of
administrative
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
a
practical
matter,
it
may
be.
as
a
legal
matter,
it
is
not
and
in
this
case,
it
was
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
because
if
relief
is
denied
at
that
point,
there
is
an
appellate
body
in
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
conducts
a
hearing
on
that
record
if
it
is
requested,
but
i
also
understand
there
is
a
procedure
to
supplement
that
record
and
i
believe
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
finally
determined
a
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
believe,
justice
fortas,
that
the
department
of
justice
sees
these
cases
until
they
arrive
at
the
stage
of
litigation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
know.
i'd
be
happy
to
determine
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
this
--
you
mean
the
employer
of
this
man?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
an
--
there
are
hernia
problem
involved,
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
came
out
of
an
on
the
job
injury,
but
the
employer
would
not
have
a
financial
interest
because
i
believe
the
scheme
of
this
benefit
is
that
if
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
is
not.
it's
a
payment
that
comes
because
of
what
has
been
paid
in
the
past
into
the
social
security
trust
funds
on
account
of
this
man's
past
employment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
well,
at
the
appellate
level
and
the
administrative
appellate
level,
the
man
may
also
be
represented
and,
in
this
particular
case,
i
believe
that
that
is
where
mr.
sharp
entered
the
case
and
i
believe
that
what
happened
is
he
filed
a
written
brief.
he
did
not
request
an
actual
appearance
before
the
appellate
tribunal.
he
offered,
i
believe,
some
additional
records
in
the
way
of
medical
testimony,
and
this
medical
testimony
together
with
the
transcript
developed
before
the
hearing
examiner
became
the
record
at
the
district
court
level.
now,
until
the
statute
was
changed
and
this
january
effective
this
summer,
compensation
at
--
for
attorney's
appearances
at
these
administrative
proceedings
was
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
he
could
allow
such
fee
as
he
saw
fit.
part
of
the
problems
here
began
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
and
this
is
the
function
of
this
recent
legislation,
that
it
allows
a
withholding
from
the
award
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
technically,
he
can
provide
a
fee
to
be
paid
by
the
claimant
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
there's
no
way
of
paying
it
out
of
the
public
money.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that's
correct.
it's
for
benefits
under
insurance
policy
where
he's
paid
the
premiums
or
they've
been
paid
on
his
behalf.
but,
there's
a
countervailing
consideration
which
i
think
appears
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
justice
fortas,
which
is
the
concern
of
the
congress
that
contingent
fee
arrangements
being
used
in
district
courts
were
allowing
fees
that
were
so
large
that
they
were
internally
eating
into
these
people's
benefits,
but
the
statute
before
this
january
allowed
fees
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary.
at
one
time,
the
secretary
had
a
regulation
saying
that
the
fees
would
be
very
limited
unless
special
application
was
made,
and
these
were
amounts
i
think
that
vary
from
$10-$50
and
i
think
it's
in
connection
with
those
limitations
that
are
not
in
effect
now,
that
much
of
the
language
in
district
court
opinions
critical
of
the
secretary's
position
was
written.
the
statute,
as
presently
drafted
for
administrative
proceedings,
allows
a
withholding
from
the
past-due
benefits
to
be
paid
directly
to
the
attorney.
under
the
prior
proceeding
--
under
the
prior
statute,
when
the
proceedings
were
simply
administrative,
the
secretary
would
establish
a
fee.
it
was
a
misdemeanor
to
collect
a
higher
fee
than
that
one,
but
the
lawyer
was
left
to
his
own
devices
to
collect
the
fee
from
the
client.
the
major
change
in
the
new
statute,
as
i
see
it,
is
to
set
for
a
withholding
scheme
up
to
25%
of
the
maximum
benefit
at
the
administrative
level.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think,
on
that
one
is--
in
that
respect,
is
indistinguishable
from
the
one
we
have
here.
there's
a
difference,
however,
because
the
new
statute
for
administrative
fees
has
several
alternatives
and
it
would
not
appear
that
the
25%
limitation
is
a
firm
limit.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
as
the
court
adjourned,
i
was
reviewing
briefly
the
administrative
procedures
followed
by
someone
who
has
applied
for
and
been
denied
social
security
benefits.
to
summarize
them
quickly,
there
are
essentially
two
steps
in
the
administrative
procedure:
a
hearing
examiner
and
appeals
council.
there's
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
at
both
stages.
there's
an
opportunity
for
counsel
at
both
stages.
in
fact,
as
the
record
in
the
district
court
here
showed,
mr.
hopkins
in
this
case
was
represented
for
the
first
time
at
the
appeal
stage,
although
he
had
written
notice
at
least
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
lower
stage
and
he
did
testify
at
the
hearing
that
he
could
read.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct.
there
are
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
was
interested
to
learn
last
night
from
the
annual
report
of
the
legal
services
program
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
that,
in
the
most
recent
fiscal
year,
they
provided
assistance
to
something
over
3,000,
i
think
the
number
was
3,200,
applicants.
and,
while
the
statistics
don't
show
the
stage
which
that
occurred,
i
would
infer
that
it
occurred
at
some
administrative
level
since
the
number
of
pending
court
cases
don't,
i
think,
reach
that
number.
but,
there
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
3,000
for
the
whole
country
and
oeo,
and
i
don't
know
how
it
breaks
down
geographically.
mr.
harris
weinstein
under
social
security
generally.
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
them
with
disability,
how
many
were
old
age
or
survivors,
but
i--
the
number
was
3,200-and
something.
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
neighborhood
legal
services
program
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
the
line
in
their
report,
just
listing
on
categories
of
welfare
problems,
lists
social
security
matter
or
something
of
that
euchring
gives
a
number
like
3,200
cases
during
a
fiscal
year.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
would
not
hazard
to
guess
on
which
happened.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
say
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think,
certainly,
it
is
and
i
think
that
what
i
have
been
able
to
uncover
since
yesterday
is,
for
example,
instructions
to
personnel
and
the
field
officers
of
the
social
security
administration.
and,
there's
a
paragraph
of
instruction
that
is
called
“explaining
hearing,”
and
they
are
told
to
give
the
applicant
who
is
dissatisfied
with
what's
been
done
with
his
initial
application
oral
advice
together
with
the
written
advice
about
what
his
rights
are.
and,
one
of
the
sentences
in
that
states
as
follows:
inform
him
that
a
hearing
is
a
semiformal
proceeding
before
a
hearing
examiner
wherein
he
may
present
evidence,
witnesses,
and
oral
or
written
arguments
and
may
appear
with
an
attorney
or
other
representative.
the
statute,
by
the
way,
makes
allowance
for
representation
by
non-attorneys.
and,
also
in
the
instruction,
it
tells
the
employee
of
the
department
to
follow
in
the
oral
presentation
a
booklet
that
is
entitled
“right
to
appeal”
that
i
would
presume
is
also
given
to
the
applicant
and
describes
generally
what
the
review
procedures
are.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there's
an
appeals
council
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
here
in
washington.
as
with
most
administrative
appellate
hearings,
the
usual
course
is
to
review
on
the
papers.
the
applicant,
if
he
wants
to,
may
request
a
personal
appearance
of
himself
or
by
his
attorney.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
only
the
hearings,
justice
brennan.
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
we
could
certainly
launch
them.
mr.
harris
weinstein
while
i
would
assume
the
former,
i
don't
know
and,
if
the
court
would
wish,
i
would
inform
the
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
will
do
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
only
knowledge
on
that
goes
to
the
procedures
for,
if
any,
for
reviewing
attorney's
fees
granted
by
the
administrators
for
representation
at
the
administrative
levels.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
answer
that,
justice
fortas.
we
did
not
brief
that
point
since
the
point
--
since
the
issues
did
go
to
the
legal
fees
allowable
in
district
courts,
but
we'd
be
happy
to
provide
the
court
with
that
information
in
a
supplemental
document.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
now,
there
are
three
possible
determinations,
justice
brennan.
one
is
to
affirm,
one
is
to
reverse,
and
one
is
to
remand
to
take
more
evidence
or
for
reconsideration
in
the
administrative
level.
and
so,
the
record
wallet
is
closed
for
purposes
of
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
may
direct
a
reopening
of
the
record.
mr.
harris
weinstein
to
the
factual
part
of
it.
of
course,
i
think
that
a
large
measure
of
the
litigation
that's
taken
place
over
the
last
five
or
seven
years
has
gone
to
the
legal
standards
in
this
area
determining
disability
and
the
courts,
i
think,
showed
a
rather
short
disagreement,
at
least
in
some
circuits,
with
the
agency's
interpretation.
now,
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
pending,
but
this
was
resolved
by
congress
in
the
recent
act
which,
i
believe,
in
section
158
(b)
of
the
act
became
effective
january
2
of
this
year
overruled
the
court's
that
had
disagreed
with
the
agency's
interpretation
of
disability.
and
so,
i
think
it's
hard
to
gauge
or
really
to
say
that
the
factual
determinations
have
been
largely
dispositive
because
there
has
been
this
legal
dispute
and,
as
i
say,
that
it
had
resulted
in
a
split
among
the
circuits
that
congress
has
now
resolved.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
the
--
yesterday
that
the
hearings
had
been
brought
to
this
court.
now,
i've
checked
this
morning
and
found
that,
although
they
are
in
the
record
of
the
district
court,
they
had
not
been
brought
forward
on
appeal
because
the
issues
had
gone
solely
to
the
maximum
attorney's
fees
and
i,
with
permission
of
the
other
side,
i
assume
we
could
have
this
sent
forward
to
this
court.
what
it
shows
is
a
record
of
129
pages,
including
transcript,
exhibits,
the
hearing
examiner's
written
decision,
the
appeal
counsel's
refusal
to
go
further
while
looking
at
additional
evidence,
the
brief
that
mr.
sharp
submitted
to
the
appeals
counsel,
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
i
understand
that
as
a
matter
of
course
this
type
of
booklet
or
exhibit
would
be
attached
to
the
agency's
answer
to
the
complaint
to
the
district
court.
now,
this
particular
transcript
shows
55
typed
pages
of
evidence
at
a
hearing
lasting
perhaps
two
hours,
but
there
is
the
same
type
of
transcript
that
one
would
have
in
a
court
proceeding.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
question,
i
think,
is
even
more
limited
than
that,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
the
maximum
amount
of
the
fee
that
a
district
court
can
direct
for
representation
before
that
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
right.
there's
no
contention
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
inadequacy
of
procedure
or
any
inadequacy
of
representation
and,
in
fact,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
decisions--
the
earlier
court
decisions
suggest
that.
for
example,
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
have
each,
in
earlier
cases,
gone
over
records
where
the
applicant
was
not--
chose
not
to
have
counsel
at
any
stage
through
the
court
of
appeals,
and
commented
on
the
meticulous
nature
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
administrator's
actions.
and,
if
the
court
is
interested
in
those
decisions
which
are
not
in
our
brief,
the
eighth
circuit
is
brasher
against
celebrezze
in
340
f.2d
at
page
413
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
paul
against
celebrezze
at
337
f.2d,
page
352.
mr.
harris
weinstein
page
413
and
340
f.2d.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
black,
and
we
reach
this
i
think
on
a
two-pronged
argument,
one
on
the
basis
of
the--
what
the
committee
report
says
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
and
the
other
is
on
our
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
legislation
arouse
at--
after
a
time
when
the
courts
had
adopted
the
practice
of
approving
fees
in
these
cases,
generally
according
to
contingent
fee
arrangements
that
the
applicant
had
entered
into
with
his
counsel,
often
going
as
high
as
30%
or
40%
or
50%
of
past-due
benefits,
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
legislation
was
introduced
and
we
think
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
back
on
this
court
practice.
and,
the
committee
report
which
we've
set
forth
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief
has
the
following
act.
it
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
that
attorneys
have,
upon
occasion,
charged
what
appear
to
be
inordinately
large
fees
for
representing
claimants
in
federal
district
court
actions
arising
under
the
social
security
program.
usually,
these
large
fees
result
from
a
contingent
fee
arrangement,
under
which
the
attorney
is
entitled
to
a
percentage
frequently
one-third
to
one-half
of
the
approved
benefits.
since
litigation
necessarily
involves
a
considerable
lapse
of
time,
in
many
cases
large
amounts
of
accrued
benefits,
and
consequently
large
legal
fees
are
payable
if
the
claimant
wins
his
case.
and
then,
there's
a
sentence
that
we
quote
that,
like
the
two
sentences
that
mr.
sharp
referred
to
yesterday,
paraphrase
the
statute.
and
--
but
from
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can
only
speak
with
precision
to
the
one
in
this
case,
justice
harlan,
and
that
was
signed
by
both,
i
believe,
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins.
and
that
probably,
it
went
to
both.
i
don't
recall
the
precise
language.
let's
--
i
think
that
the
language
is,
at
best,
ambiguous.
it
says
that
mr.
sharp
isn't
hired
to
prosecute
his
claim,
referring
to
mr.
hopkins,
but
then
the
document
is
signed
by
both
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
believe
so
if
it
takes
place
with
respect
to
court
proceedings.
when
the
fee
is
charged
for
proceedings
before
the
agency,
then
it
has
to
be
subjected
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
it's
a
misdemeanor
to
charge
more
than
he
approves.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there
was
a
wife
and
two
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
document,
on
its
face,
i
think
is
silent.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
document,
on
its
face,
i
believe
is
silent.
i
don't--
i
do
not
see
the
names
of
the
children
and,
although
it
does
say
that
the
contract
is
between
mr.
and
mrs.
hopkins
and
mr.
sharp.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
he
surely
sits
there
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
surely
ma--
sits
there
to
make
a
decision
and
he
does
give
--
render
a
written
decision.
i
don't
know
and
if
in
terms
of
his
instructions
or
the
secretary's
conception
of
the
hearing
examiner's
role
to
what
extent
he
is
expected
to
seek
out
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
claimant,
but
we
would
certainly
include
this
information
in
what
we
would
provide
the
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
do
not
think
that
there's
been
any
contention
that
these
proceedings
have,
in
a
general
way,
been
unfair
to
claimants.
mr.
harris
weinstein
even
when
there
has
been
no
counsel
present.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
alright,
sir.
in
view
of
this
legislative
history
which
was
least
intended
to
cut
back
the
fees
then
being
approved
and
paid
through
court
actions,
the
congress
adopted
section
206
(b)(1)
of
the
statute,
using
the
word
“claimant.”
and,
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
the
very
narrow
question
of
interpretation
in
this
case
and
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
comes
down
to
what
does
the
word
“claimant”
mean
in
this
statute
and
we
suggest,
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation,
there
are
several
clauses
in
the
statute
that
modify
the
word
“claimant”
and
conclusively
define
it
in
a
way
that
can
mean
only
the
plaintiff
who
happens
to
be
before
the
court
in
that
case,
that
is
the
head
of
the
family
in
this
case,
mr.
hopkins,
and
that
it
does
not
include
anybody
else.
we
begin
this
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
statute
with
the
first
phrase.
the
statute
begins,
“whenever
a
court
renders
a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant
under
this
subchapter,”
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language,
“a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant”
is
something
that
ordinarily
would
refer
to
a
plaintiff
before
a
court.
he's
the
person
on
whose
behalf
and
whose
favor
a
judgment
is
rendered.
then,
the
statute
goes
on
to
speak
of
“claimant
under
this
subchapter
who
was
represented
before
the
court
by
an
attorney,”
and
we
suggest
that
there
are
two
points
in
that
phraseology.
first,
the
language
“before
the
court.”
it
suggests
the
claimant
is
the
person
who
is
before
the
court,
the
person
who
is
a
party.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
have
a
justiciable
controversy
with
the
secretary,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
could
certainly
join
as
parties.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
have
a
derivative
controversy
but
if,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
secretary
agreed
that
the
dependants
qualified
for
benefits,
if
the
principal
claimant
benef
--
qualified,
they
would
have
no
controversy.
they
would
be
allowed
to
come
into
court
under
the
statute
to
represent
the
principal
claimant
if
they
wanted
to.
they
could
--
they
are
essentially
given
standing
to
assert
his
rights
on
his
behalf,
but
they
would
still
not
be
the
claimant
represented
before
the
court
on
whose
behalf
a
favorable
judgment
is
entered.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
in
this
court
action,
and
the
claims
for
the
wife
and
children
are
in
separate
documents.
the
checks
for
the
entire
family
come
in
two
separate
amounts:
one
for
the
children,
and
one
for
the
husband
and
wife
together.
mr.
harris
weinstein
which
in
--
sir,
involved
only
the
father,
mr.
hopkins.
there
has
been
no
administrative
denial
of
the
rights
of
the
dependants.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct.
that's
the
only
pers
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
had
been
a
crane
operator,
i
believe.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
grade
school
education.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
only
thing
that
he
could've
been
saying
is
his
rights.
his
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
children
and
wife's
status
as
dependants
have
previously
been
approved.
the
termination
of
the
benefits
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
this
case
they
would
be,
justice
fortas.
and,
a
ques
--
but
i
think
the
word
“claim,”
to
begin
with,
is
a
case
that
has
a
generally
accepted
meaning
in
the
law.
the
claim
the
formal
--
listed
on
the
formal
request
for
hearing
here,
the
claim
given
in
the
caption
of
the
transcript
was
only
the
case
of
raymond
hopkins
and
the
question
whether
he
himself
was
disabled.
now
there
are
two
--
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
here
that
there
are
two
ways
procedurally
in
which
the
dependant's
claims
can
be
disposed
of.
in
this
case,
it
happened
that
the
dependant
status
was
approved
before
mr.
hopkins'
own
claims
were
terminated,
so
that
they
were
all
approved.
they
were
all
receiving
claims.
they
were
all
receiving
benefits
on
their
original
claim.
all
benefits
were
then
terminated
because
the
--
in
the
secretary's
view,
mr.
hopkins'
disability
had
terminated.
when
the
court
directed
the
secretary
to
resume
mr.
hopkins'
benefits
by
finding
that
he
was
disabled,
the
result
was
the
secretary
knew
that
mrs.
hopkins
was
indeed
the
wife
of
mr.
hopkins,
that
there
were
these
children,
that
they
all
satisfy
the
necessary
requirements
of
age
to
quo
--
the
statute
establishes
and,
therefore,
mr.
sharp
could
say
that,
in
this
case,
it
followed
automatically
that
the
benefits
were
resumed.
but,
another
case
that
could
equally
arise
would
be
saying
the
circumstances
where
the
secretary
found
at
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
no
disability.
therefore,
the
secretary
would
not
ordinarily
have
reached
the
claim
of
the
dependants.
he
wouldn't
have
determined
whether
there
was
a
marital
relationship.
he
wouldn't
have
determined
whether
the
claimants
satisfy
the
requirements
of
age.
in
that
situation,
the
judgment
in
favor
of
mr.
hopkins
would've
only
established
one
of
three
essential
facts
and
two
would
not
yet
been
established.
they
couldn't
be
litigated
in
the
court
as
a
claim
in
the
court
until
mrs.
hopkins
and
the
children
had
gone
through
the
administrative
procedures.
presumably,
they
would
benefit
and
the
secretary
would
have
reached
the
same
determination
and
allow
the
claims
administratively
with
no
need
for
asserting
a
dispute.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
reason
why
he
could
not,
justice
harlan,
to
the
extent
that
he
charged
a
fee
to
the
dependants
for
administrative
proceedings.
he
would
have
to
have
that
fee
approved
by
the
secretary.
but,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
approved,
he
could
collect
it.
he
could
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
up
to
--
under
the
new
legislation,
which
i've
misspoken
myself
yesterday,
it
is
effective
now.
it
is
not
postponed
until
this
summer.
he
could
--
when
the
fee
is
approved
by
the
secretary,
it
would
be
to
the
extent
of
25%
of
the
past-due
benefits.
it
would
be
withheld
from
the
fund
that
the
secretary
had.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
statute
does
--
no
way
speaks
to
disbursements
or
expenses,
and
our
assumption
is
that
they're
allowable
in
addition
to
the
fee,
although
they
might
not
be
collectable
out
of
the
sum,
but
the
law--
as
we
read
the
statute,
the
lawyer
legally
can
collect
his
disbursements
in
addition
to
this
fee
and
could
collect
them
directly
from
beneficiaries.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
might
--
i
don't
know
the
status,
say,
of
a
separated
wife.
i
assume
she'll
be
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
except
--
i
don't
know
the
precise
answer
to
that,
justice
black.
i
think
she
is.
certainly,
say,
a
child
who
is
a
student
and
under
the
age
of,
i
think,
22
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
22,
is
entitled
to
benefits
and
the
children's
checks,
as
this
record
shows,
whatever
he
age
of
the
children,
those
amounts
come
in
a
separate
check.
mr.
harris
weinstein
addressed
to
the
children.
now,
i
assume,
for
minor
children,
they
go
to
the
parent
as
guardian,
but
this
record
in
the
letter
from
the
social
security
administration
shows
that
they
will
--
the
checks
come
in
two
separate
amounts:
one
to
mother
and
father,
one
for
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
there
is
a
disability,
this
agency.
this
particular
claim
here
is
a
claim
for
disabling
injury
to
the
husband.
mr.
harris
weinstein
for
a
disabling
injury
to
the
--
i
do
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
work
connected.
it
does
not
have
to
be,
but
it
hinges
on
this
--
the
fact
of
disability.
i
think
there
is
also
an
additional
matter
in
the
statute
that
helps
us
define
a
claim
because
the
statute
speaks
of
the
limit
on
a
fee
for
such
representation,
and
such
representation
refers
back
to
the
representation
before
the
court
of
the
claimant.
and,
the
statute
goes
on
to
s
--
in
setting
the
maximum
amount
of
the
fee,
says
that
it
shall
not
be
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
claimant
is
entitled
by
reason
of
such
judgment.
now,
here
again,
we
suggest
that
the
word
“entitled”
is
a
word
with
a
distinct
legal
meaning.
it
should
mean
claim
of
right
and
the
claimant,
in
this
case
mr.
hopkins,
is
the
only
person
who
has
a
fixed
claim
of
right
by
reason
of
the
court's
judgment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
prove
additional
facts
that
were
not
liti
--
in
controversy
before
the
court.
the
court's
judgment
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
they
are
the
children
and
they
are
the
appropriate
age.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
then,
to
determine
the
amount
to
which
they're
entitled,
they
may
have
to
show
something
about
whether
they
have
other
income.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
claimants
but
they
are
not
the
claimant
before
the
court,
i
would
suggest,
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
are
not,
justice
black.
they
may
or
may
not
be.
if
the
claim
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
they
are
in
fact
decided
together,
if
they
do
in
fact
litigate
together
in
the
district
court,
then
the
attorney's
fee,
if
he
represents
them
all,
can
be
measured
by
the
total
amount
of
the
benefits
that
they
all
secure
by
reason
of
the
court
judgment.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry,
sir.
perhaps
that's
because
in
the
ordinary
case
the
only
matter
that
is
litigated
before
the
court
is
the
bro
--
the
claim
of
the,
as
in
this
case,
the
father
of
one
claimant.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
it's
as
simple
as
that,
justice
brennan,
because
i
assume
they
have
to
have
a
justiciable
controversy
and
they
have
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
depend
on
a
finding
of
disability,
a
finding
of
relationship,
and
a
finding
of
age.
mr.
harris
weinstein
wherever
the
secretary
disputed
the
relationship
or
the
age.
the
--
first,
this
type
of
litigation
in
itself
represents
perhaps
3%
of
all
social
security
claims,
but
there
are
a
variety
of
cases
where,
say,
the
relationship
of
parent
and
child
might
dis--
be
disputed.
one
example
of
that
the
court
might
be
interested
in
is
a
case
called
chernack
in
360
f.2d,
i
don't
recall
the
page
citation,
where
the
question
was
whether
there
had
--
this
was
a
widow's
claim
for
benefits
that
was
allowed.
and
then,
there
was
a
child.
it
was
the
father's
child
but
not
the
mother's
child,
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
child
had
been
adopted
before
death
of
the
father
and,
therefore,
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
statute.
but,
there
could
be
this
kind
of
controversy.
there
are
controversies
as
to
whether
there's
a
marriage.
if
they
don't
all
come
together
in
one
case
at
the
same
time,
they
will
not
all
come
before
the
court
at
the
same
time.
mr.
harris
weinstein
they
were
not,
justice
black.
in
this
case,
the
secretary
had
no
disagreement
with
the
proposition
that
mrs.
hopkins
was
a
lawful
wife,
these
children
were
at
the
proper
age
to
collect
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
suggest
this,
justice
fortas,
that
the
statute
--
the
statutory
terms,
i
don't
think,
can
be
read
one
way
for
this
kind
of
case
where
the
secretary
is
in
an
--
in
advanced
higher
--
agreed
that
the
wi
--
the
woman
and
children
are
the
wife
and
children
of
the
proper
age
and,
yet,
a
different
reading
be
reserved
for
the
case
that
would
have
arisen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
our
disagreement
is
in
terms
of
whether
or
what
is
the
significance
of
the
phraseology
that
congress
has
used,
and
congress
has
spoken
of
the
person
before
the
court
who
becomes
entitled
to
something
by
reason
of
the
judgment.
and,
in
terms
of
the
significance
of
the
contingent
fee
arrangement,
our
understanding
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
was
quite
dissatisfied
with
the
court-approved
contingent
fee
arrangements
and
that
congress
was
trying
to
put
on
the
courts
the
responsibility
of
approving
fees
within
a
fixed
limit
that
did
not
eat
into
the
award
to
the
claimants.
now,
i
think
one
consequence
of
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
one
was
from
the
committee
report
in
the
statute
by
statute
anal
--
the
section
by
section
analysis.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
know.
i'm
sure
there
are
a
number.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but,
i
would
al
--
the
statute,
that
language
and
the
statement
of
mr.
mills
on
the
floor
is
not
significantly
different
from
the
committee
language
that
we've
set
forth.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
our
disagreement,
justice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
anything
like
this,
any
claims
of
this
nature
or
litigation
of
this
nature
under
fela.
in
our
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
one
difference
is
that,
in
this
case,
the
claims
are
not
always
or
usually
litigated
together
because
a
controversy
may
only
go
to
one
part
of
the
claim
or
any
controversy,
say,
the
children
might
have
might
be
resolved
at
the
administrative
rather
than
in
the
courts
--
at
the
court
level.
and,
i
think
that
one
consequence
of
the
--
what
i
would
call
the
broader
reading
of
the
statute
for
which
the
petitioners
argue
is
that
where
there
is
a
separate
controversy
between
the
wife
and
the
secretary
where
she
proceeds
differently
in
the
administrative
process,
where
as
--
if
25%
of
her
funds
have
been
paid
to
the
lawyer
who
represented
her
husband,
where
--
from
where
is
the
secretary
going
to
satisfy
the
fee
that
the
statute
tells
him
to
allow
to
whoever
represents
the
wife.
now,
i
think
what
the
statute
does
is
give
the
wife
and
the
children
and
the
husband
their
options.
each
can
or
cannot
hire
a
lawyer
to
present
their
particular
facts.
the
husband
can
hire
a
lawyer
to
present
his
facts
on
issue
of
disability.
then,
the
wife
and
the
children
can
determine
whether
it's
worthwhile
to
pay
additional
money
to
have
a
lawyer
present
the
question
of
whether
they
are
wife
and
children
and
whether
they
are
of
the
appropriate
ages.
and
if
--
if
they
choose
to
present
that
controversy
through
a
lawyer,
then
there
ought
to
be,
and
congress
in
the
recent
legislation
contemplated
that
there
would
be,
funds
left
to
pay
that
lawyer
to
encourage
him
to
come
in.
the
--
if,
on
the
other
hand,
they
ch
--
decide
that
these
facts
are
so
clear
and
simple,
as
they
apparently
were
in
this
case,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
congress
has
taken
the
view
of
not
requiring
them
to
pay
a
lawyer
because
these
facts
aren't
subject
to
controversy.
now,
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
it
is
fixing
at
maximum
fee.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
it's
true,
justice
harlan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
think
it's
true,
justice
harlan,
that
their
case
to
a
very
great
extent
depends
on
the
proposition
that
the
reading
that
we
intend
for
results
in
fees
that
are
too
low.
now,
of
course,
one
consequence
of
their
reading,
i
imagine,
would
be
that
single
claimants
would
never
be
represented
because
it
would
follow
from
their
reading
that
the
fee
for
representing
a
bachelor
or
a
widow
or
a
widower
would
be
less
than
half
of
the
fee
for
representing
somebody
who
was
married
with
two
children
even
though
the
controversy
might
be
of
the
same
nature.
but,
beyond
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
the
contention
--
let's
say
that
the
representation
would
be
inhibited,
justice
stewart.
their
argument
is
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
their
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
fees
under
the
reading
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
have
such
a
low
limit
that
it
is
not
economic
for
attorneys
to
take
these
cases,
that
they
need
the
higher
limit
for
the
cases
to
be
economic.
if
that's
correct,
the
lower
limit
that
they
say
is
inadequate
will
always
apply
unless
they
are
dependants.
i'm
assuming,
by
their
argument,
that
this
would
inhibit
at
least
the
representation
of
single
people
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
result
that
congress
likely
wanted
to
bring
about.
but,
beyond
that,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
amount
of
fees
that
had
been
allowed
here,
if
you
compare
it
to
the
amount
of
work
that
is
ordinarily
involved
and
fees
allowed
in
other
situations,
that
it
--
that
you'd
--
it
appears
that
this
argument
is
not
one
that
is
clearly
right.
it's
not
one
that
is
clearly
wrong
and
it's
one
that
belongs
in
congress
if
it
hasn't
already
been
lost
there.
these
fees
here
are
only
for
representation
in
court.
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
representation
before
the
secretary,
the
lawyer
can't
go
to
the
secretary
and
apply
for
a
separate
fee.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
of
approval.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
that's
right,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
there
had
been
some
cases,
for
example,
where
there'd
been
a
court
proceeding
followed
by
a
remand.
i
believe
the
courts
have
contemplated
a
fee
from
the
secretary
for
his
--
for
the
work
there
in
front
of
the
courts
because
--
but
as
--
we
have
collected
some
statistics
which
we
set
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
and
the
median
fee
for
these
representations,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
has
been
running
$800.00
or
$900.00
for
a
proceeding
that
is
limited
essentially
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
preexisting
record.
the
fourth
circuit,
which
has
taken
what
it
considers
a
broader
reading
and
what
it
says
it
is
rejecting
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute,
has
so
far
refused
to
allow
a
fee
as
high
as
the
petitioners
argue
for.
in
fact,
most
recently,
the
case
of
redden,
i
believe
it
is,
where
the
fourth
circuit
originally
rendered
the
decision
that
resulted
in
the
conflict
with
this
case
was
back
into
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
allowance
of
the
fee
and
the
district
court
had
allowed
a
fee
of
25%
of
the
$16,000-benefits
payable
to
the
whole
family.
and,
the
fourth
circuit
said
this
is
just
too
high
and
they
cut
it
back
to
something
around
2,200
and
the
25%
of
the
--
only
the
father's
benefits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
surely.
but
i
--
the
point
it
would
like
to
make,
justice
black,
is
that
the
courts
that
have
adopted
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
have
not
agreed
so
far
that
higher
fees
are
necessary
to
secure
adequate
representation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
justice
harlan,
that
there's
no
question
about
the
court's
exercising
discretion.
the
problem
is
the
limits
within
which
that
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
and,
as
--
for
the
reason
we've
pointed
out,
we
would
urge
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
hope
not
and
the
courts,
at
least
the
court
circuit,
has
not
--
we
would
agree,
has
not
done
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
that's
certainly
right,
justice
stewart,
and
we
would
assume
that
these
are
the
factors
that
congress
also
kept
in
mind
in
establishing
this
limit.
and,
for
the
reasons
we've
set
forth,
we
believe
that
limit
is
as
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
said.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
white?
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
with
--
it
precludes
him
from
collecting
privately
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
in
section
206
(a)
of
the
statute
which
is
section
406
(a)
in
the
us
code
and,
it
allows
the
--
together
with
the
amendments
that
went
into
force
this
january,
it
allows
the
secretary
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
governing
fees.
it
directs
him
to
allow
a
fee
to
any
representative
which
presumably
a
lawyer
could
be
if
he
prosecuted
the
wife's
claim
before
the
secretary.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
statute
is
clear
that
with
--
unless
it's
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary,
it
is
a
misdemeanor,
but
there's
no
--
if
i
may
take
another
moment?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
the
secretary
is
parsimonious
in
these
matters,
although
this
is
again
a
matter
for,
i
would
think,
for
the
congress.
the
--
our
review
of
the
fees,
which
is
not
in
the
brief,
indicates
that
the
secretary,
in
the
last
several
years,
each
year
allows
several
hundred
fees.
i
think,
in
the
calendar
of
1966
there
were
over
800.
a
majority
of
them
are
under
$500.00.
on
the
other
hand,
a
good
number
of
them
range
from
500
and
some
much
as
high
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
as
2,000.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
limitation
on
the
total
fee
to
the
family.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
would
be
in
section
206
(b)(2),
the
immediately
following
subsection
which
i
don't
believe
that
anybody
has
printed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
we
read
the
new
statute.
it
--
the
25%
limit
is
on
the
withholding.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but,
the
statute
says
that
the
withholding
from
the
accrued
benefits
shall
be
the
lesser
of
the
fee
approved
by
the
secretary
or
25%
or
the
contingent
fee,
and
i
assume
that
means
that
the
approved
fee
could
be
higher
than
25%.
