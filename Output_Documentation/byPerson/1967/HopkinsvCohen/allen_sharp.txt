mr.
allen
sharp
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
social
security
disability
case
involving
the
question
of
the
maximum
fee
to
be
awarded
in
a
united
states
district
court,
under
the
social
security
act,
to
attorneys
under
the
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
of
1965.
the
factual
background
of
the
case
in
its
very
simplest
form
is
that
in
january
of
1961,
the
petitioner
raymond
hopkins
and
his
wife
and
his
two
minor
children,
he
on
their
behalf,
filed
an
application
for
disability
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
and
was
awarded
disability
benefits
commencing
in
march
of
1961.
the
award
of
the
disability
benefits
was
on
one
piece
of
paper,
a
form
--
standard
form
of
the
social
security
administration.
the
applications
were
on
three
different
pieces
of
paper
for
the
wife,
for
raymond
hopkins,
and
for
his
minor
children.
by
action
of
the
social
security
administration
in
1962,
late
in
the
year
in
december,
the
disability
benefits
to
mr.
hopkins
and
the
benefits
of
his
wife
and
to
his
two
minor
children
were
terminated
upon
the
contention
by
the
social
security
administration
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
on
his
own
and
without
the
benefit
of
counsel,
in
july
--
on
july
30,
1963,
mr.
hopkins
filed
a
request
for
a
rehearing,
which
rehearing
was
held
october
9,
1963
in
danville,
illinois,
and,
the
examiner's
decision
was
announced
on
november
27,
1963.
mr.
hopkins
and
his
wife
attended
this
hearing
without
counsel
and
had,
at
this
point,
not
conferred
with
counsel.
the
decision
was
adverse
to
mr.
hopkins
and,
the
--
at
that
point,
the
examiner
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
secretary
to
discontinue
benefits,
and
this
was
appealed
by
me
as
counsel
for
mr.
hopkins.
appeals
counsel
of
the
department--
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
department
of
social
security
administration,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
this
case
was
first
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
lafayette,
indiana
on
july
2,
1964.
on
september
30,
1964
--
1965,
i'm
sorry,
the
united
states
district
judge
in
this
case
reversed
the
decision
of
the
social
security
administration
and
awarded
benefits
retroactive
to
january
1,
1963.
the
principal
issue
involved
is
an
interpretation
of
one
sentence
of
the
social
security
act,
an
amendment
of
the
social
security
act
of
1965.
i
might
say,
parenthetically,
that
this
amendment
is
a
very
small
part.
it's
one
sentence
of
the
massive
amendments
that
were
added
to
the
social
security
act
by
the
congress
in
1965.
it's
been
suggested
in
an
opinion
--
in
several
opinions,
including
one
by
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
legislative
history
is
somewhat
scant.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
illustrate
that
there
are
some-350
pages
of
legislative
history
about
the
amendments.
there
are
only
two
or
three
paragraphs
about
this
particular
sentence,
but
the
sentence
is
206
(b)
(1)
and
the
crucial
part
of
it
is
that
whenever
a
court
renders
a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant,
under
this
sub-chapter,
who
is
represented
before
the
court
by
an
attorney,
the
court
may
determine
and
allow,
as
a
part
of
its
judgment,
a
reasonable
fee
for
such
representations,
not
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
claimant
is
entitled
by
a
reason
of
such
judgment.

i'd

by

mr.
allen
sharp
one
of
the
--
mr.
allen
sharp
may
i
backup
a
minute,
your
honor.
i
was
employed
in
this
case
in
may
of
1964,
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute
and,
at
that
time,
there
were
numerous
cases
which
stated
that
the
matter
of
fees
between
a
claimant
and
his
attorney,
once
the
matter
was
resolved
administratively
and
when
it
was
before
a
united
states
district
court,
was
a
matter
of
contract
and
i
signed
such
a
contract.
i
am
not
here
contending,
and
i
do
not
here
contend
that
that
contract
is
now
valid.
mr.
allen
sharp
on
40%
in
the
event
of
a
successful
trial
and
50%
in
the
event
of
an
appeal.
might
i
say
this,
that
it
was
our
experience
that
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
have
no
statistics
other
than
my
observation
and
what
attorneys
have
told
me,
that
the
government
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
very
high
percentage
of
these
cases
and,
yet,
that
was
a
factor
which
i
took
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
the
percentages.
these
percentages
are
--
there
were
numerous
cases
that
judicially
affirmed
these
percentages
in
this
type
of
a
contract.
i
am
not
here
asserting
--
i
do
not
here
assert
that
that
contract
is
now
valid.
i
believe
the
congress
has
the
right
to
legislate
in
the
face
of
such
a
contract.
i
do
here
assert
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
united
states
district
judge
who
made
this
decision,
two
months
to
the
day
after
the
in
--
after
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment,
that
it
was
his
intention
to
allow,
under
the
statute,
the
maximum
fee
that
was
permissible.
and,
he
took
the
position
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
him
in
this
case
and
joined
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
sims
case
that
the
deter
--
that
the
base
--
the
maximum
base,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
to
be
allowed
in
every
case,
but
the
maximum
base
on
which
a
fee
is
to
be
based
by
a
united
states
district
judge
is
the
benefits
of
the
so-called
primary
claimant
who
is
raymond
hopkins
here
--
mr.
allen
sharp
exclusive
of
any
benefits
to
his
dependent
wife
and
children.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
it's
$3,774.80.
mr.
allen
sharp
the
benefits
to
raymond
hopkins
alone
--
mr.
allen
sharp
are
$3,774.80.
mr.
allen
sharp
$936.20.
mr.
allen
sharp
the
act
of
the
court
in
determining
the
disability
arraignment
of
raymond
hopkins
automatically
determined
the
entitlement
of
his
dependents
and
his
wife
dependent.
mr.
allen
sharp
no,
the
courts
don't
determine
the
amounts.
mr.
allen
sharp
it's
25%,
as
i
read
the
statute
and
as
i
think
congress
intended
and
as
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
have
read
the
statute,
is
25%
of
the
total
benefits
that
automatically
come
and
sprang
from
the
attorney's
effort
in
successfully
prosecuting
a
client.
mr.
allen
sharp
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
allen
sharp
they
request
the
united
states
attorney
to
tell
us
what
it
is
and
then
--
mr.
allen
sharp
it
would
be
$2,124.02.
mr.
allen
sharp
that
is
2
--
no.
so
far,
we're
playing
with
figures
here.
the
benefits
to
raymond
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
$4,752.10.
we
agree
on
that.
that's
in
the
--
mr.
allen
sharp
$1,188.02.
mr.
allen
sharp
$2,124.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
correct.
now,
may
i
say
this,
that
it's
very
easy
for
me
to
criticize
the
conduct
of
the
social
security
administration
and
the
hearing
examiner.
i
will
not
do
that
because
it
has
been
done
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
judicial
decisions,
and
some
of
which
i
have
cited
to
the
court
and
by
the
appellate
courts
and
by
other
courts.
i
think,
in
the
context
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
number
one,
raymond
hopkins
was
virtually
illiterate.
he
had
a
seventh-grade
education.
he
could
read
and
write.
he
went
to
a
hearing
without
an
attorney.
he
didn't
think
he
needed
a
lawyer.
he
didn't
know
that
he
needed
one
until
the
decision
came
back
from
washington.
and,
i
would
say
that
it
is
in
the
record
that
there
are
several
layers
that
turned
him
down
because
they
didn't
want
to
fool
with
this
kind
of
claim.
after
--
while
he
was
there
in
an
atmosphere
that
he
didn't
understand,
in
a
hearing
where
the
evidence
was
taken
down,
he
had
extracted
from
him,
by
the
hearing
examiner,
various
types
of
omissions
and
leading
questions
and
the
sup
--
in
the
opinion
of
judge
ashborne
in
the
circuit
court,
on
september
30,
1965,
he
severely
criticizes
the
conduct
of
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
conduct
of
hearing
examiners
in
these
cases
have
been
severely
criticized.
now,
what's
the
significance
of
this?
the
significance
of
it
is
that
when
we
go
to
the
united
states
district
court,
one
should
get
a
lawyer,
as
happened
in
this
case.
and,
you
go
to
the
united
states
district
court.
all
you
review
is
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record,
and
at
the
--
in
this
case,
raymond
hopkins
didn't
have
an
attorney
and
he
didn't
make
a
very
good
record
and,
notwithstanding
that,
the
united
states
district
judge
chose
to
reverse
it,
and
rightfully
so,
on
the
merits
of
the
question
of
disability.
this
is
really
important
because,
in
interpreting
the
congressional
intention
of
the
statute,
i'm
sure
that
it
was
not
the
con
--
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
so
restrictively
interpret
this
statute
so
as
to
a
practical
matter
to
discourage
lawyers
from
handling
these
claims.
and,
may
i
say
most
respectfully,
i
will
not
argue
here
that
if
the
court
affirms
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
send
that
lawyers
will
quit
handling
these
cases.
i
don't
think
that's
true,
but
i
will
say
this.
that
it's
my
deep
conviction
and
it's
the
deep
conviction
of
many
other
people,
that
it
will
be
a
step
towards
seriously
discouraging
able
and
confident
lawyers
from
representing
these
very
needy
people.
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
these
cases
filed.
if
you
will
look
in
the
us
code
annotations,
there
are
thousands
of
them,
and
many
of
them
reach
the
appellate
court
level.
so,
this
is
of
some
great
significance.
we
do
not
believe,
and
i
do
not
believe,
that
my
particular
economics
or
the
economics
of
the
bar
is
at
all
a
consideration
in
this.
i'm
sure
the
bar
will
do
very
well
if
these
cases
were
eliminated
entirely,
but
i
do
say
that,
because
of
the
need
for
legal
services
of
these
people
of
the
raymond
hopkins'
that
it
certainly
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
have
this
statute
interpreted
so
narrowly
and
so
restrictively
as
to,
in
effect,
discourage
competent
lawyers
from
representing
these
people.
let
me
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
this
may
be
true.
i
think
there's
a
trend
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
there's
a
trend,
certainly
in
our
state,
of
--
because
of
what
i'm
talking
about,
that
lawyers
simply
wouldn't
take
the
cases,
couldn't
afford
to
take
them.
but,
now,
we
are
moving
back
in
workman's
compensation
cases
in
indiana
and
i
can't
speak
for
the
whole
country,
tort
fees
that
are
certainly
as
high
or
higher
than
would
be
allowed
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
that
is
--
mr.
allen
sharp
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
–
the
--
to
me,
there
is
nothing
in
the
congressional
history
and
especially
these
two
paragraphs
that
say
that
all
the
benefits
that
automatically
followed
from
the
decision
that
raymond
hopkins
was
no
--
was
continued
to
be
disabled,
that
one
set
of
the
benefits
should
be
examined.
now,
i'm
not
saying,
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
redden
and
lambert
and
two
other
cases
that
i
want
to
cite,
one
of
which
is
not
reported,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
coleman
in
a
very
excellent
opinion
in
an
unreported
case
have
all
said
this
doesn't
mean
that
united
states
district
judge
will
or
should
in
all
cases
allow
the
maximum
fee.
in
fact,
there
are
many
cases
that
he
shouldn't,
but
let's
take
the
hard
case.
let's
take
the
case
where
the
benefits
are
particularly
low.
let's
take
the
raymond
hopkins
case
and
say
that
the
government
pursued
its
appeal
and
i
would
remind
that
the
record
shows
that
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
it's
very
possible
that
we
might
have
had
to
appeal
this
case.
and,
i
have
appealed
many
cases
but
i'm
learning
in
this
one,
it's
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
case
that
the
congress
had
no
intention
in
the
hard
case,
in
the
difficult
case,
to
discourage
a
lawyer
from
pursuing
this
thing
vigilantly
for
his
client.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
that's
been
decided.
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
this
is
true
and
i
think
that
we'd
be
sticking
our
heads
in
the
sand
to
say
that
it
isn't
true,
and
this
is
a
widespread
thing
that
the
lawyer
plays
a
crucial
role
for
a
very
important
segment
of
our
society
in
this
system
and
it's
a
crucial
role
to
make
the
system
work,
in
my
opinion.
and,
it's
my
view
that
the
narrow
and
restrictive
interpretation
that's
placed
upon
this
statute
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
going
to
have,
in
that
effect,
discouraging
good
lawyers
from
handling
these
cases,
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
demanded.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress,
particularly
the
two
items
of
legislative
history
which
are
not
in
the
brief.
may
i
say
this,
that
i
think
that
there
is
an
un
--
there's
a
non-published
opinion,
if
i
may
read
two
or
three
sentences
from
it,
that
is
referred
to
in
the
brief,
but
the
part
that
is
--
relates
to
this
issue
is
not
in
the
brief
and
it's
an
opinion
by
judge
coleman.
it's
in
alsobrooks
versus
gardner
and
it's
--
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
wrote
the
comments,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
well--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
don't
know.
i'm
sorry.
if
i
had
gotten
it
sooner,
i'd
have
put
it
in
the
brief
but
the
mechanics
of
getting
these
things
is
slow
sometimes
and
i
didn't
become
aware
of
it
until
after
the
brief
was
filed,
but
it's
well-reasoned
and
it's
easy
to
follow.
let
me
read
just
a
--
briefly
from
it.
on
april
15,
1966,
this
court
entered
its
order
allowing
to
counsel
in
alsobrooks
an
attorney's
fee
in
the
amount
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
appellant
is
entitled
by
reason
of
the
award
to
the
appellant
of
social
security
disability
benefits.
a
dispute
has
now
risen
between
the
secretary
and
counsel
for
alsobrooks
as
to
the
amount
of
the
attorney
fees
properly
to
be
paid
pursuant
to
the
above
order.
the
secretary
says
that
counsel
was
entitled
only
to
25%
of
the
amounts
recovered
for
alsobrooks
personally,
analogous
to
hopkins,
personally,
in
our
case.
counsel
for
alsobrooks
contends
that
he
is
entitled
to
25%
of
the
total
amount
recovered
for
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
the
effects
by
which
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents
finally
succeeded
in
receiving
the
social
security
benefits
due
them,
extended
over
a
period
of
four
years,
including
proceedings
in
the
district
court
and
in
this
court,
all
of
which
are
part
of
the
record.
it
was
the
intention
of
this
court
in
its
order
of
april
15,
1966
to
hold
and
to
direct
that
counsel
was
entitled
to
the
25%
of
all
sums
recovered
in
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
had
it
not
been
for
the
faithful
assistance
of
his
counsel,
neither
alsobrooks
nor
his
dependents
would
have
received
anything.
and,
the
repeated
denials
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
would
not
have
been
overturned.
the
services
were
rendered
both
to
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
they
all
received
the
benefits.
the
order
of
april
15
should
be
properly
complied
with.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes.
it's
ollie
alsobrooks
versus
gardner,
357
f.2d
110.
that
is
not
this
opinion.
that
is
of
an
earlier
opinion.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allen
sharp
this
was
jul
--
an
order
supplemental
referred
to
in
both
briefs
in
this
case
of
july
20,
1967,
united
states
court
of
appeals,
fifth
circuit,
no.
22587.
i
apologize
for
not
having
these
materials,
but
this
is
a
recent
statute
and
there's
been
some
development
since
our
briefs
were
filed
as
a
result
of
--
in
this
case
and
in
some
others.
i
would
also
like
to
cite
to
the
court
a
published
opinion
--
two
published
opinions
that
have
come
down
and
been
published
since
our
briefs
were
filed,
and
one
of
them
is
a
fourth
cir
--
another
fourth
circuit
case,
conner
versus
gardner,
381
f.2d
497.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
fourth
circuit,
july
25,
1967.
it
wasn't
published
until
late
this
year,
381
f.2d
497.
and,
a
united
states
district
court
case,
mauldin
versus
gardner,
district
court
of
south
carolina,
264
federal
supplement,
page
370,
both
of
those
cases
or--
one
of
them
is
directly
on
point
and
the
counter
case
is
relatively
on
point
but
it
indicates
the
broad
remedial
reading
of
the
statue
rather
than
a
narrow
reading
of
a
statute.
conner
is
particularly
interesting
because,
in
conner,
there
was
a
remand
by
the
united
states
district
judge
to
the
secretary,
and
no
other
decision
was
made
by
the
district
judge.
the
secretary
ultimately
awarded
benefits,
and
c
--
the
attorney
petitioned
for
the
court
and
the
court
said
that
the
court
still
had
jurisdiction
under
this
same
statute
to
award
a
fee
for
services
rendered
in
the
court,
even
though
the
court
didn't
technically
render
a
judgment
other
than
the
judgment
on
remand
which
indicates
that
there
is
going
to
be,
and
should
be,
a
broad
reading
of
these
--
of
the
statute.
mr.
allen
sharp
i
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
if
they're
fortunate,
they
do.
mr.
allen
sharp
there's
another
section
of
the
statute,
your
honor--
mr.
allen
sharp
which
was
recently
been
liberalized
by
a
mandate--
mr.
allen
sharp
which
went
into
effect
july
2,
1968
which
provides
the
secretary
now
may,
not
now
but,
it
may
grant
benefit
--
it
may
grant
--
mr.
allen
sharp
counsel
fees
for
services
before
it.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
haven't
--
this
statute
is
brand
new
but,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
obligatory
on
the
secretary
now
to
award
some
fee
by
question
of
reasonableness
and
there
are
other
factors
involved
in
it.
mr.
allen
sharp
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
implication.
mr.
allen
sharp
he
goes
to
the
social
security
office
and
they
fill
out
the
forms
for
him.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
he
goes
and
looks
for
one.
that's
what
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
think
it
does
happen
a
great
deal
because
one
only
has
to
look
at
the
annotations
in
the
us
code
and
there
are
that
thick
of
these
cases.
mr.
allen
sharp
i
mean
there
are
thousands
of
them.
mr.
allen
sharp
a
reasonable
allowance
for
the
maximum,
and
what
we're
trying
to
decide
here
is
what's
the
maximum.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
it's
identically
the
same
language,
as
i
see
it,
with
the
possible
addition
of
the
word
“total”
in
the
other
statute.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
--
certainly
be
a
guideline
and
i
--
it
may
well
decide
it.
there
may
be
some
slight
differences
in
the
statute
--
the
administrative
statute,
but
i
think
it
will
be
a
guide.
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
allen
sharp
affirmative,
yes.
mr.
allen
sharp
i'm
not
sure
on
this
new
statute.
i'm
of
the
impression
that
it
will
be
certified
and
paid
directly
to
counsel.
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
i
did
read
the
next
sentence
which
tells
us
how
it
is
to
be
certified
and
paid
directly
to
counsel.
may
i
say
this,
with
reference
to
the
number
of
these
cases
and
the
problems
that
are
inherent
in
them,
a
judge
in
the
third
circuit
recently,
in
a
case
called
“seldomridge
versus
celebrezze,
238
f.
supp.
610,”
recently
indicated
and
set
out
some
statistics
with
regard
to
the
number
of
reversals.
and,
his
statistics
were
that
60
--
75%
of
the
cases
are
reversed
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
90%
of
the
reversals
are
on
the
basis
that
there's
an
--
that
there's
bas
--
that
there's
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record.
may
i
say
this,
that
there
are
two
sentences
in
a
case
called
“mckenti
versus
gardner,”
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
with
because
i
think
it's
the
crux
of
this.
availability
of
lawyers
to
such
claimant
is
of
the
highest
importance
and
if
a
lawyer
is
to
receive
no
compensation,
unless
there
is
reward,
his
compensation
is
contingent
whether
or
not
he
has
a
contract
that
says
so.
most
of
the
disability
claimants
have
no
other
resources
for
the
payment
of
fees.
the
contingency
of
compensation,
whether
it
stems
from
an
employment
contract
or
results
from
a
claimant's
indigency
is
highly
irrelevant
in
the
appraisable
--
in
the
appraisal
of
a
reasonableness
of
any
such
fees.
the
effective
lawyer
will
not
win
all
of
his
cases
and
any
determination
of
the
reasonableness
of
his
fees
in
these
cases
in
which
his
client
prevails
must
take
into
account
the
lawyer's
risks
of
receiving
nothing
for
his
services.
charges
on
the
basis
of
a
minimal
hourly
rate
are
surely
inappropriate.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
statute
should
be
adopted
and
that
the
seventh
and
sixth
circuit
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
too
narrow
and
restrictive.
mr.
allen
sharp
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
social
security
disability
case
involving
the
question
of
the
maximum
fee
to
be
awarded
in
a
united
states
district
court,
under
the
social
security
act,
to
attorneys
under
the
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
of
1965.
the
factual
background
of
the
case
in
its
very
simplest
form
is
that
in
january
of
1961,
the
petitioner
raymond
hopkins
and
his
wife
and
his
two
minor
children,
he
on
their
behalf,
filed
an
application
for
disability
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
and
was
awarded
disability
benefits
commencing
in
march
of
1961.
the
award
of
the
disability
benefits
was
on
one
piece
of
paper,
a
form
--
standard
form
of
the
social
security
administration.
the
applications
were
on
three
different
pieces
of
paper
for
the
wife,
for
raymond
hopkins,
and
for
his
minor
children.
by
action
of
the
social
security
administration
in
1962,
late
in
the
year
in
december,
the
disability
benefits
to
mr.
hopkins
and
the
benefits
of
his
wife
and
to
his
two
minor
children
were
terminated
upon
the
contention
by
the
social
security
administration
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
on
his
own
and
without
the
benefit
of
counsel,
in
july
--
on
july
30,
1963,
mr.
hopkins
filed
a
request
for
a
rehearing,
which
rehearing
was
held
october
9,
1963
in
danville,
illinois,
and,
the
examiner's
decision
was
announced
on
november
27,
1963.
mr.
hopkins
and
his
wife
attended
this
hearing
without
counsel
and
had,
at
this
point,
not
conferred
with
counsel.
the
decision
was
adverse
to
mr.
hopkins
and,
the
--
at
that
point,
the
examiner
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
secretary
to
discontinue
benefits,
and
this
was
appealed
by
me
as
counsel
for
mr.
hopkins.
appeals
counsel
of
the
department--
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
department
of
social
security
administration,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
this
case
was
first
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
lafayette,
indiana
on
july
2,
1964.
on
september
30,
1964
--
1965,
i'm
sorry,
the
united
states
district
judge
in
this
case
reversed
the
decision
of
the
social
security
administration
and
awarded
benefits
retroactive
to
january
1,
1963.
the
principal
issue
involved
is
an
interpretation
of
one
sentence
of
the
social
security
act,
an
amendment
of
the
social
security
act
of
1965.
i
might
say,
parenthetically,
that
this
amendment
is
a
very
small
part.
it's
one
sentence
of
the
massive
amendments
that
were
added
to
the
social
security
act
by
the
congress
in
1965.
it's
been
suggested
in
an
opinion
--
in
several
opinions,
including
one
by
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
legislative
history
is
somewhat
scant.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
illustrate
that
there
are
some-350
pages
of
legislative
history
about
the
amendments.
there
are
only
two
or
three
paragraphs
about
this
particular
sentence,
but
the
sentence
is
206
(b)
(1)
and
the
crucial
part
of
it
is
that
whenever
a
court
renders
a
judgment
favorable
to
a
claimant,
under
this
sub-chapter,
who
is
represented
before
the
court
by
an
attorney,
the
court
may
determine
and
allow,
as
a
part
of
its
judgment,
a
reasonable
fee
for
such
representations,
not
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
claimant
is
entitled
by
a
reason
of
such
judgment.

i'm
sorry.
mr.

sharp
the
last
page
in
--
the
page
number
in
the
congressional
record
is
a-6569.
mr.
allen
sharp
a
comment
by
chairman
mills.
mr.
allen
sharp
one
of
the
--
mr.
allen
sharp
may
i
backup
a
minute,
your
honor.
i
was
employed
in
this
case
in
may
of
1964,
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute
and,
at
that
time,
there
were
numerous
cases
which
stated
that
the
matter
of
fees
between
a
claimant
and
his
attorney,
once
the
matter
was
resolved
administratively
and
when
it
was
before
a
united
states
district
court,
was
a
matter
of
contract
and
i
signed
such
a
contract.
i
am
not
here
contending,
and
i
do
not
here
contend
that
that
contract
is
now
valid.
mr.
allen
sharp
on
40%
in
the
event
of
a
successful
trial
and
50%
in
the
event
of
an
appeal.
might
i
say
this,
that
it
was
our
experience
that
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
have
no
statistics
other
than
my
observation
and
what
attorneys
have
told
me,
that
the
government
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
very
high
percentage
of
these
cases
and,
yet,
that
was
a
factor
which
i
took
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
the
percentages.
these
percentages
are
--
there
were
numerous
cases
that
judicially
affirmed
these
percentages
in
this
type
of
a
contract.
i
am
not
here
asserting
--
i
do
not
here
assert
that
that
contract
is
now
valid.
i
believe
the
congress
has
the
right
to
legislate
in
the
face
of
such
a
contract.
i
do
here
assert
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
united
states
district
judge
who
made
this
decision,
two
months
to
the
day
after
the
in
--
after
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment,
that
it
was
his
intention
to
allow,
under
the
statute,
the
maximum
fee
that
was
permissible.
and,
he
took
the
position
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
him
in
this
case
and
joined
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
sims
case
that
the
deter
--
that
the
base
--
the
maximum
base,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
to
be
allowed
in
every
case,
but
the
maximum
base
on
which
a
fee
is
to
be
based
by
a
united
states
district
judge
is
the
benefits
of
the
so-called
primary
claimant
who
is
raymond
hopkins
here
--
mr.
allen
sharp
exclusive
of
any
benefits
to
his
dependent
wife
and
children.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
it's
$3,774.80.
mr.
allen
sharp
the
benefits
to
raymond
hopkins
alone
--
mr.
allen
sharp
are
$3,774.80.
mr.
allen
sharp
$936.20.
mr.
allen
sharp
the
act
of
the
court
in
determining
the
disability
arraignment
of
raymond
hopkins
automatically
determined
the
entitlement
of
his
dependents
and
his
wife
dependent.
mr.
allen
sharp
no,
the
courts
don't
determine
the
amounts.
mr.
allen
sharp
it's
25%,
as
i
read
the
statute
and
as
i
think
congress
intended
and
as
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
have
read
the
statute,
is
25%
of
the
total
benefits
that
automatically
come
and
sprang
from
the
attorney's
effort
in
successfully
prosecuting
a
client.
mr.
allen
sharp
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
allen
sharp
they
request
the
united
states
attorney
to
tell
us
what
it
is
and
then
--
mr.
allen
sharp
it
would
be
$2,124.02.
mr.
allen
sharp
that
is
2
--
no.
so
far,
we're
playing
with
figures
here.
the
benefits
to
raymond
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
$4,752.10.
we
agree
on
that.
that's
in
the
--
mr.
allen
sharp
$1,188.02.
mr.
allen
sharp
$2,124.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
correct.
now,
may
i
say
this,
that
it's
very
easy
for
me
to
criticize
the
conduct
of
the
social
security
administration
and
the
hearing
examiner.
i
will
not
do
that
because
it
has
been
done
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
judicial
decisions,
and
some
of
which
i
have
cited
to
the
court
and
by
the
appellate
courts
and
by
other
courts.
i
think,
in
the
context
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
number
one,
raymond
hopkins
was
virtually
illiterate.
he
had
a
seventh-grade
education.
he
could
read
and
write.
he
went
to
a
hearing
without
an
attorney.
he
didn't
think
he
needed
a
lawyer.
he
didn't
know
that
he
needed
one
until
the
decision
came
back
from
washington.
and,
i
would
say
that
it
is
in
the
record
that
there
are
several
layers
that
turned
him
down
because
they
didn't
want
to
fool
with
this
kind
of
claim.
after
--
while
he
was
there
in
an
atmosphere
that
he
didn't
understand,
in
a
hearing
where
the
evidence
was
taken
down,
he
had
extracted
from
him,
by
the
hearing
examiner,
various
types
of
omissions
and
leading
questions
and
the
sup
--
in
the
opinion
of
judge
ashborne
in
the
circuit
court,
on
september
30,
1965,
he
severely
criticizes
the
conduct
of
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
conduct
of
hearing
examiners
in
these
cases
have
been
severely
criticized.
now,
what's
the
significance
of
this?
the
significance
of
it
is
that
when
we
go
to
the
united
states
district
court,
one
should
get
a
lawyer,
as
happened
in
this
case.
and,
you
go
to
the
united
states
district
court.
all
you
review
is
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record,
and
at
the
--
in
this
case,
raymond
hopkins
didn't
have
an
attorney
and
he
didn't
make
a
very
good
record
and,
notwithstanding
that,
the
united
states
district
judge
chose
to
reverse
it,
and
rightfully
so,
on
the
merits
of
the
question
of
disability.
this
is
really
important
because,
in
interpreting
the
congressional
intention
of
the
statute,
i'm
sure
that
it
was
not
the
con
--
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
so
restrictively
interpret
this
statute
so
as
to
a
practical
matter
to
discourage
lawyers
from
handling
these
claims.
and,
may
i
say
most
respectfully,
i
will
not
argue
here
that
if
the
court
affirms
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
send
that
lawyers
will
quit
handling
these
cases.
i
don't
think
that's
true,
but
i
will
say
this.
that
it's
my
deep
conviction
and
it's
the
deep
conviction
of
many
other
people,
that
it
will
be
a
step
towards
seriously
discouraging
able
and
confident
lawyers
from
representing
these
very
needy
people.
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
these
cases
filed.
if
you
will
look
in
the
us
code
annotations,
there
are
thousands
of
them,
and
many
of
them
reach
the
appellate
court
level.
so,
this
is
of
some
great
significance.
we
do
not
believe,
and
i
do
not
believe,
that
my
particular
economics
or
the
economics
of
the
bar
is
at
all
a
consideration
in
this.
i'm
sure
the
bar
will
do
very
well
if
these
cases
were
eliminated
entirely,
but
i
do
say
that,
because
of
the
need
for
legal
services
of
these
people
of
the
raymond
hopkins'
that
it
certainly
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
have
this
statute
interpreted
so
narrowly
and
so
restrictively
as
to,
in
effect,
discourage
competent
lawyers
from
representing
these
people.
let
me
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
this
may
be
true.
i
think
there's
a
trend
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
there's
a
trend,
certainly
in
our
state,
of
--
because
of
what
i'm
talking
about,
that
lawyers
simply
wouldn't
take
the
cases,
couldn't
afford
to
take
them.
but,
now,
we
are
moving
back
in
workman's
compensation
cases
in
indiana
and
i
can't
speak
for
the
whole
country,
tort
fees
that
are
certainly
as
high
or
higher
than
would
be
allowed
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
that
is
--
mr.
allen
sharp
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
–
the
--
to
me,
there
is
nothing
in
the
congressional
history
and
especially
these
two
paragraphs
that
say
that
all
the
benefits
that
automatically
followed
from
the
decision
that
raymond
hopkins
was
no
--
was
continued
to
be
disabled,
that
one
set
of
the
benefits
should
be
examined.
now,
i'm
not
saying,
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
redden
and
lambert
and
two
other
cases
that
i
want
to
cite,
one
of
which
is
not
reported,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
coleman
in
a
very
excellent
opinion
in
an
unreported
case
have
all
said
this
doesn't
mean
that
united
states
district
judge
will
or
should
in
all
cases
allow
the
maximum
fee.
in
fact,
there
are
many
cases
that
he
shouldn't,
but
let's
take
the
hard
case.
let's
take
the
case
where
the
benefits
are
particularly
low.
let's
take
the
raymond
hopkins
case
and
say
that
the
government
pursued
its
appeal
and
i
would
remind
that
the
record
shows
that
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
it's
very
possible
that
we
might
have
had
to
appeal
this
case.
and,
i
have
appealed
many
cases
but
i'm
learning
in
this
one,
it's
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
case
that
the
congress
had
no
intention
in
the
hard
case,
in
the
difficult
case,
to
discourage
a
lawyer
from
pursuing
this
thing
vigilantly
for
his
client.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
that's
been
decided.
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
think
this
is
true
and
i
think
that
we'd
be
sticking
our
heads
in
the
sand
to
say
that
it
isn't
true,
and
this
is
a
widespread
thing
that
the
lawyer
plays
a
crucial
role
for
a
very
important
segment
of
our
society
in
this
system
and
it's
a
crucial
role
to
make
the
system
work,
in
my
opinion.
and,
it's
my
view
that
the
narrow
and
restrictive
interpretation
that's
placed
upon
this
statute
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
going
to
have,
in
that
effect,
discouraging
good
lawyers
from
handling
these
cases,
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
demanded.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress,
particularly
the
two
items
of
legislative
history
which
are
not
in
the
brief.
may
i
say
this,
that
i
think
that
there
is
an
un
--
there's
a
non-published
opinion,
if
i
may
read
two
or
three
sentences
from
it,
that
is
referred
to
in
the
brief,
but
the
part
that
is
--
relates
to
this
issue
is
not
in
the
brief
and
it's
an
opinion
by
judge
coleman.
it's
in
alsobrooks
versus
gardner
and
it's
--
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
wrote
the
comments,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
well--
mr.
allen
sharp
i
don't
know.
i'm
sorry.
if
i
had
gotten
it
sooner,
i'd
have
put
it
in
the
brief
but
the
mechanics
of
getting
these
things
is
slow
sometimes
and
i
didn't
become
aware
of
it
until
after
the
brief
was
filed,
but
it's
well-reasoned
and
it's
easy
to
follow.
let
me
read
just
a
--
briefly
from
it.
on
april
15,
1966,
this
court
entered
its
order
allowing
to
counsel
in
alsobrooks
an
attorney's
fee
in
the
amount
of
25%
of
the
total
of
the
past-due
benefits
to
which
the
appellant
is
entitled
by
reason
of
the
award
to
the
appellant
of
social
security
disability
benefits.
a
dispute
has
now
risen
between
the
secretary
and
counsel
for
alsobrooks
as
to
the
amount
of
the
attorney
fees
properly
to
be
paid
pursuant
to
the
above
order.
the
secretary
says
that
counsel
was
entitled
only
to
25%
of
the
amounts
recovered
for
alsobrooks
personally,
analogous
to
hopkins,
personally,
in
our
case.
counsel
for
alsobrooks
contends
that
he
is
entitled
to
25%
of
the
total
amount
recovered
for
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
the
effects
by
which
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents
finally
succeeded
in
receiving
the
social
security
benefits
due
them,
extended
over
a
period
of
four
years,
including
proceedings
in
the
district
court
and
in
this
court,
all
of
which
are
part
of
the
record.
it
was
the
intention
of
this
court
in
its
order
of
april
15,
1966
to
hold
and
to
direct
that
counsel
was
entitled
to
the
25%
of
all
sums
recovered
in
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
had
it
not
been
for
the
faithful
assistance
of
his
counsel,
neither
alsobrooks
nor
his
dependents
would
have
received
anything.
and,
the
repeated
denials
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
would
not
have
been
overturned.
the
services
were
rendered
both
to
alsobrooks
and
his
dependents.
they
all
received
the
benefits.
the
order
of
april
15
should
be
properly
complied
with.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes.
it's
ollie
alsobrooks
versus
gardner,
357
f.2d
110.
that
is
not
this
opinion.
that
is
of
an
earlier
opinion.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allen
sharp
this
was
jul
--
an
order
supplemental
referred
to
in
both
briefs
in
this
case
of
july
20,
1967,
united
states
court
of
appeals,
fifth
circuit,
no.
22587.
i
apologize
for
not
having
these
materials,
but
this
is
a
recent
statute
and
there's
been
some
development
since
our
briefs
were
filed
as
a
result
of
--
in
this
case
and
in
some
others.
i
would
also
like
to
cite
to
the
court
a
published
opinion
--
two
published
opinions
that
have
come
down
and
been
published
since
our
briefs
were
filed,
and
one
of
them
is
a
fourth
cir
--
another
fourth
circuit
case,
conner
versus
gardner,
381
f.2d
497.
mr.
allen
sharp
yes,
fourth
circuit,
july
25,
1967.
it
wasn't
published
until
late
this
year,
381
f.2d
497.
and,
a
united
states
district
court
case,
mauldin
versus
gardner,
district
court
of
south
carolina,
264
federal
supplement,
page
370,
both
of
those
cases
or--
one
of
them
is
directly
on
point
and
the
counter
case
is
relatively
on
point
but
it
indicates
the
broad
remedial
reading
of
the
statue
rather
than
a
narrow
reading
of
a
statute.
conner
is
particularly
interesting
because,
in
conner,
there
was
a
remand
by
the
united
states
district
judge
to
the
secretary,
and
no
other
decision
was
made
by
the
district
judge.
the
secretary
ultimately
awarded
benefits,
and
c
--
the
attorney
petitioned
for
the
court
and
the
court
said
that
the
court
still
had
jurisdiction
under
this
same
statute
to
award
a
fee
for
services
rendered
in
the
court,
even
though
the
court
didn't
technically
render
a
judgment
other
than
the
judgment
on
remand
which
indicates
that
there
is
going
to
be,
and
should
be,
a
broad
reading
of
these
--
of
the
statute.
mr.
allen
sharp
i
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
if
they're
fortunate,
they
do.
mr.
allen
sharp
there's
another
section
of
the
statute,
your
honor--
mr.
allen
sharp
which
was
recently
been
liberalized
by
a
mandate--
mr.
allen
sharp
which
went
into
effect
july
2,
1968
which
provides
the
secretary
now
may,
not
now
but,
it
may
grant
benefit
--
it
may
grant
--
mr.
allen
sharp
counsel
fees
for
services
before
it.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
haven't
--
this
statute
is
brand
new
but,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
obligatory
on
the
secretary
now
to
award
some
fee
by
question
of
reasonableness
and
there
are
other
factors
involved
in
it.
mr.
allen
sharp
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
implication.
mr.
allen
sharp
he
goes
to
the
social
security
office
and
they
fill
out
the
forms
for
him.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
he
goes
and
looks
for
one.
that's
what
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
i
think
it
does
happen
a
great
deal
because
one
only
has
to
look
at
the
annotations
in
the
us
code
and
there
are
that
thick
of
these
cases.
mr.
allen
sharp
i
mean
there
are
thousands
of
them.
mr.
allen
sharp
a
reasonable
allowance
for
the
maximum,
and
what
we're
trying
to
decide
here
is
what's
the
maximum.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
allen
sharp
that's
right.
mr.
allen
sharp
well,
it's
identically
the
same
language,
as
i
see
it,
with
the
possible
addition
of
the
word
“total”
in
the
other
statute.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
--
certainly
be
a
guideline
and
i
--
it
may
well
decide
it.
there
may
be
some
slight
differences
in
the
statute
--
the
administrative
statute,
but
i
think
it
will
be
a
guide.
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
allen
sharp
affirmative,
yes.
mr.
allen
sharp
i'm
not
sure
on
this
new
statute.
i'm
of
the
impression
that
it
will
be
certified
and
paid
directly
to
counsel.
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
i
did
read
the
next
sentence
which
tells
us
how
it
is
to
be
certified
and
paid
directly
to
counsel.
may
i
say
this,
with
reference
to
the
number
of
these
cases
and
the
problems
that
are
inherent
in
them,
a
judge
in
the
third
circuit
recently,
in
a
case
called
“seldomridge
versus
celebrezze,
238
f.
supp.
610,”
recently
indicated
and
set
out
some
statistics
with
regard
to
the
number
of
reversals.
and,
his
statistics
were
that
60
--
75%
of
the
cases
are
reversed
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
90%
of
the
reversals
are
on
the
basis
that
there's
an
--
that
there's
bas
--
that
there's
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record.
may
i
say
this,
that
there
are
two
sentences
in
a
case
called
“mckenti
versus
gardner,”
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
with
because
i
think
it's
the
crux
of
this.
availability
of
lawyers
to
such
claimant
is
of
the
highest
importance
and
if
a
lawyer
is
to
receive
no
compensation,
unless
there
is
reward,
his
compensation
is
contingent
whether
or
not
he
has
a
contract
that
says
so.
most
of
the
disability
claimants
have
no
other
resources
for
the
payment
of
fees.
the
contingency
of
compensation,
whether
it
stems
from
an
employment
contract
or
results
from
a
claimant's
indigency
is
highly
irrelevant
in
the
appraisable
--
in
the
appraisal
of
a
reasonableness
of
any
such
fees.
the
effective
lawyer
will
not
win
all
of
his
cases
and
any
determination
of
the
reasonableness
of
his
fees
in
these
cases
in
which
his
client
prevails
must
take
into
account
the
lawyer's
risks
of
receiving
nothing
for
his
services.
charges
on
the
basis
of
a
minimal
hourly
rate
are
surely
inappropriate.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
statute
should
be
adopted
and
that
the
seventh
and
sixth
circuit
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
too
narrow
and
restrictive.
