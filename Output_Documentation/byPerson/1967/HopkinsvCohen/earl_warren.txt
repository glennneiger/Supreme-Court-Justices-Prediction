mr.
sharp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
are
the
two
or
three
paragraphs
of
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
legislative
history
show
is
the
reason
for
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
that
--
does
that
conflict
with
what
the
attorney
general
or
solicitor
general
has
in
his
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
doesn't
conflict
in
any
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
claim
go
beyond
those
two
statements
that
you've
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
rather
common
throughout
the
country
in
workman's
compensation
cases
for
the
states
to
limit
very
drastically
the
fees
that
can
be
charged
to
these
people
because
most
of
them
are
in
--
were
on
the
borderline
of
poverty
before
they
had
their
accident
and
were
actually
poverty-stricken
after
they
did
get
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
much
difference
between
a
case
--
is
there
much
difference
between
a
case
of
this
kind
and
a
case
of
a
man
who
has
a
$500
claim
against
someone
and
he
goes
to
a
good
firm
of
lawyers
whose
time
is
valuable
and
he's
going
to
involve
some
litigation?
isn't
there
the
same
inclination
on
the
part
of
so
called
good
lawyers
that
you
say
not
to
take
a
case
of
that
kind
because
there
isn't
any
money
in
it
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
the
employer
have
a
lawyer
at
the
hearing
--
administrative
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
injured,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
26,
raymond
hopkins,
petitioner,
versus
john
w.
gardner,
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
please
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
children
involved
here
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
wife
and
the
husband
presume
to
sign
it
on
behalf
of
the
children
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
just
a
moment.
again,
when
i
ask
you
that
question
about
the
examiner,
what
i
really
want
to
know
is
this.
what
is
the
function
of
the
examiner
when
he
takes
the
evidence
in
these
cases?
is
he
sitting
there
as
a
judge
in
an
adversary
case
deciding
between
the
claimant
and
the
agency
or
is
he
there
to
help
and
to
see
that
the
claimant
gets
all
the
facts
in
the
case
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
i
know,
in
some
workman's
compensation
jurisdictions,
the
examiner
there
is
suppose
to
look
after
the
interest
of
the
claimant.
that's
why
they
don't
encourage
lawyers
to
be
in
that
initial
hearing
and
the
examiner,
himself,
is
suppose
to
see
that
the
claimant
gets
a
fair
deal,
gets
his
facts
brought
out
properly
and
that
no
advantage
taken
of
him.
and
i
just
wondered
if
that
same
principle
was
in
this
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
have
--
but
if
you
have
an
ignorant
man,
we'll
say
or
don't
use
that
harsh
word,
let's
just
say
an
unschooled
man
who
comes
to
a
hearing
of
this
kind
and
he
faced
with
the
agency
and
he
needs
to
prove
his
claim,
he's
not
capable
of
doing
it.
and,
i
just
wondered
if
it
was
a
duty
of
the
hearing
officer
to
help
him
an
to
see
that
the
facts
are
developed
and
that
it's
all
in
the
record
there
so
that
a
fair
appraisal
can
be
made
or
whether
he's
there
as
a
judge
in
an
adversary
proceeding
and
letting
each
party
put
in
its
own
evidence.
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
--
i
think
it
would
be
enlightening
though
to
--
for
the
court
to
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
know,
why,
there's
no
use
in
taking
time
on
it
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
go
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gearinger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
does
that.
but,
does
he
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
that
his
responsibility,
to
act
as
all
of
these
things,
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can
act
as
a
prosecutor
against
the
claimant,
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
people
are
taken
from
the
civil
service
list
for
the
particular
reason
that
they
will
not
be
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
government,
are
they
not,
and
so
that
they
will
be
independent
in
their
view
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
read
very
confidently,
a
moment
ago,
that
they
were
prosecutor
and
advisor
to
the
secretary
and
all
the
other
dominance
that
they
could
think
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now
you
knew
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
you
know
about
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gearinger,
now
that
you've
answered
that,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
your
procedure
again.
now,
let's
suppose
this,
that
you
have
two
men,
x
and
y,
who
have
the
identical
disability.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
proceed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
before
this
tribunal.
one
of
them
is
married
and
has
three
little
infant
children,
like
mr.
hopkins.
the
other
one
is
a
bachelor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
hears
--
they
hear
both
cases
and
they
both
get
an
identical
award.
for
some
reason
rather,
they
go
to
the
courts
with
a
lawyer,
both
are
sustained.
are
you
clear
on
what
i've
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
tell
me.
what
additional
work
would
a
lawyer
have
to
do
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
had
a
wife
and
three
children
to
do
in
order
to
get
that
decree
over
what
the
man
with
--
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
was
a
bachelor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
testify
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
have
to
have
that
for
the
other
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you'd
have
to
have
other
witnesses
for
the
bachelor
just
the
same
whether
they
were
wife
and
children
or
not,
or
it
might
be
a
mother
and
a
father,
brothers
and
sisters.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
the
evidentiary,
whatever
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whatever
it
is,
would
the
evidentiary
requirements
be
any
different
in
the
case
of
the
bachelor
or
the
man
with
three
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
in
addition
to
that
would
they
have
to
prove
for
the
man
who
had
a
wife
and
three
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
they
would
have
to
ask
two
questions,
one
for
the
wife,
“are
you
the
wife?”
and
she
would
say,
yes,
and
you'd
have
to
ask
somebody
if
the
children
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
his
children.
and,
that's
the
only
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
--
but
still
you
are
of
the
opinion
that
congress
couldn't
limit
or
shouldn't
limit
the
attorney's
fees
to
a
percentage
of
the
original
claimant
himself
but,
on
the
other
hand,
you
claim
that
congress
intended
that
a
lawyer
should
take
up
to
25%
of
everything
that
comes
in
to
the
wife
and
to
these
children
from
the
time
their
legs
and
arms
were
happed
up
until
they're
21
years
of
age.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
ask
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
this
25%
or
not,
and
whether
it
is
prospective
or
whether
it
is
retrospective
in
the
percentages
that
he's
entitled
to
get,
why
should
a
man
in
the
case
with
the
wife
and
three
children
have
to
be
entitled
to
get
25%
of
all
of
the
payments
that
had
been
made
to
the
wife
and
children
if
all
he
has
to
do
is
ask
him
if
they
are
the
wife
or
are
the
children?
now,
don't
you
think
that
congress
has
a
right
to
say
that
it
shall
be
limited
to
that
--
to
just
the
claimant
himself
rather
than
the
other,
and
don't
you
think
in
a
case
of
this
kind
congress
intended
to
have
a
strict
application
so
that
these
people
would
not
be
--
this
kind
of
claimant
should
not
be
overborne
by
lawyer's
contracts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we've
heard
that
draft
yesterday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
276,
raymond
hopkins,
petitioner,
versus,
john
w.
gardner,
secretary
of

mr.
sharp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
are
the
two
or
three
paragraphs
of
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
legislative
history
show
is
the
reason
for
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
that
--
does
that
conflict
with
what
the
attorney
general
or
solicitor
general
has
in
his
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
doesn't
conflict
in
any
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
claim
go
beyond
those
two
statements
that
you've
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
rather
common
throughout
the
country
in
workman's
compensation
cases
for
the
states
to
limit
very
drastically
the
fees
that
can
be
charged
to
these
people
because
most
of
them
are
in
--
were
on
the
borderline
of
poverty
before
they
had
their
accident
and
were
actually
poverty-stricken
after
they
did
get
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
much
difference
between
a
case
--
is
there
much
difference
between
a
case
of
this
kind
and
a
case
of
a
man
who
has
a
$500
claim
against
someone
and
he
goes
to
a
good
firm
of
lawyers
whose
time
is
valuable
and
he's
going
to
involve
some
litigation?
isn't
there
the
same
inclination
on
the
part
of
so
called
good
lawyers
that
you
say
not
to
take
a
case
of
that
kind
because
there
isn't
any
money
in
it
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
the
employer
have
a
lawyer
at
the
hearing
--
administrative
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
injured,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
26,
raymond
hopkins,
petitioner,
versus
john
w.
gardner,
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
please
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
children
involved
here
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
wife
and
the
husband
presume
to
sign
it
on
behalf
of
the
children
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
just
a
moment.
again,
when
i
ask
you
that
question
about
the
examiner,
what
i
really
want
to
know
is
this.
what
is
the
function
of
the
examiner
when
he
takes
the
evidence
in
these
cases?
is
he
sitting
there
as
a
judge
in
an
adversary
case
deciding
between
the
claimant
and
the
agency
or
is
he
there
to
help
and
to
see
that
the
claimant
gets
all
the
facts
in
the
case
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
i
know,
in
some
workman's
compensation
jurisdictions,
the
examiner
there
is
suppose
to
look
after
the
interest
of
the
claimant.
that's
why
they
don't
encourage
lawyers
to
be
in
that
initial
hearing
and
the
examiner,
himself,
is
suppose
to
see
that
the
claimant
gets
a
fair
deal,
gets
his
facts
brought
out
properly
and
that
no
advantage
taken
of
him.
and
i
just
wondered
if
that
same
principle
was
in
this
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
have
--
but
if
you
have
an
ignorant
man,
we'll
say
or
don't
use
that
harsh
word,
let's
just
say
an
unschooled
man
who
comes
to
a
hearing
of
this
kind
and
he
faced
with
the
agency
and
he
needs
to
prove
his
claim,
he's
not
capable
of
doing
it.
and,
i
just
wondered
if
it
was
a
duty
of
the
hearing
officer
to
help
him
an
to
see
that
the
facts
are
developed
and
that
it's
all
in
the
record
there
so
that
a
fair
appraisal
can
be
made
or
whether
he's
there
as
a
judge
in
an
adversary
proceeding
and
letting
each
party
put
in
its
own
evidence.
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
--
i
think
it
would
be
enlightening
though
to
--
for
the
court
to
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
know,
why,
there's
no
use
in
taking
time
on
it
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
go
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gearinger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
does
that.
but,
does
he
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
that
his
responsibility,
to
act
as
all
of
these
things,
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can
act
as
a
prosecutor
against
the
claimant,
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
people
are
taken
from
the
civil
service
list
for
the
particular
reason
that
they
will
not
be
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
government,
are
they
not,
and
so
that
they
will
be
independent
in
their
view
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
read
very
confidently,
a
moment
ago,
that
they
were
prosecutor
and
advisor
to
the
secretary
and
all
the
other
dominance
that
they
could
think
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now
you
knew
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
you
know
about
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gearinger,
now
that
you've
answered
that,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
your
procedure
again.
now,
let's
suppose
this,
that
you
have
two
men,
x
and
y,
who
have
the
identical
disability.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
proceed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
before
this
tribunal.
one
of
them
is
married
and
has
three
little
infant
children,
like
mr.
hopkins.
the
other
one
is
a
bachelor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
hears
--
they
hear
both
cases
and
they
both
get
an
identical
award.
for
some
reason
rather,
they
go
to
the
courts
with
a
lawyer,
both
are
sustained.
are
you
clear
on
what
i've
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
tell
me.
what
additional
work
would
a
lawyer
have
to
do
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
had
a
wife
and
three
children
to
do
in
order
to
get
that
decree
over
what
the
man
with
--
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
was
a
bachelor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
testify
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
have
to
have
that
for
the
other
man.

well,
you'd
have
to
have
other
witnesses
for
the
bachelor
just
the
same
whether
they
were
wife
and
children
or
not,
or
it
might
be
a
mother
and
a
father,
brothers
and
sisters.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
the
evidentiary,
whatever
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whatever
it
is,
would
the
evidentiary
requirements
be
any
different
in
the
case
of
the
bachelor
or
the
man
with
three
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
in
addition
to
that
would
they
have
to
prove
for
the
man
who
had
a
wife
and
three
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
they
would
have
to
ask
two
questions,
one
for
the
wife,
“are
you
the
wife?”
and
she
would
say,
yes,
and
you'd
have
to
ask
somebody
if
the
children
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
his
children.
and,
that's
the
only
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
--
but
still
you
are
of
the
opinion
that
congress
couldn't
limit
or
shouldn't
limit
the
attorney's
fees
to
a
percentage
of
the
original
claimant
himself
but,
on
the
other
hand,
you
claim
that
congress
intended
that
a
lawyer
should
take
up
to
25%
of
everything
that
comes
in
to
the
wife
and
to
these
children
from
the
time
their
legs
and
arms
were
happed
up
until
they're
21
years
of
age.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
ask
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
this
25%
or
not,
and
whether
it
is
prospective
or
whether
it
is
retrospective
in
the
percentages
that
he's
entitled
to
get,
why
should
a
man
in
the
case
with
the
wife
and
three
children
have
to
be
entitled
to
get
25%
of
all
of
the
payments
that
had
been
made
to
the
wife
and
children
if
all
he
has
to
do
is
ask
him
if
they
are
the
wife
or
are
the
children?
now,
don't
you
think
that
congress
has
a
right
to
say
that
it
shall
be
limited
to
that
--
to
just
the
claimant
himself
rather
than
the
other,
and
don't
you
think
in
a
case
of
this
kind
congress
intended
to
have
a
strict
application
so
that
these
people
would
not
be
--
this
kind
of
claimant
should
not
be
overborne
by
lawyer's
contracts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we've
heard
that
draft
yesterday.
