justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
there,
mr.--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
sharp,
25%
of
the
past-due
benefits
which
i
gather
are
now
known,
is
that
right?
the
figure
is
known.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
much
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
benefits
are
77?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
fee
would
be
700
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
900
--
now,
of
course,
whatever
the
plaintiffs,
defendants
may
ultimately
be
entitled
to
can't
be
determined
until
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
did
not
determine
any
amount,
did
it?
it
couldn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
my
question
then
is
how
is
the
25%,
if
it's
to
be
enhanced
above
the
$900,
again,
it's
25%
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
25%
or
is
that
the
100%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see,
so
then
it'd
be
25%
of
that
amount
plus
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
total
fee
on
your
submission
would
be
around
$2,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rather
than
the
$900.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
those
are
ordinarily
fees
which
are
in
addition
to
awards,
aren't
they?
they're
not
taken
from
the
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
a
--
this
is
taken
out
of
the
award,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
suppose
this
awards
made
by
the
district
judge
doesn't
necessarily
reflect,
does
it,
any
compensation
for
a
work
on
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sharp,
i
take
it
pres
--
did
counsel
ever
get
into
the
proceedings
before
the
examiner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
they?
do
you
know?
plus,
there's
no
provision,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but,
i
gather,
unless
you
have
to
reduce
something
to
judgment
in
the
district
court,
there's
no
provision
for
compensation
for
services
before
the
commissioner,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is?
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
counsel
fees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
the
secretary
assures
that
every
claimant
will
have
a
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering.
how
does
counsel
get
in,
though,
how
--
into
the
proceeding
in
the
first
instance?
does
he
have
to
be
retained
counsel
or
how
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
i
take
it
a
claimant
--
as
a
claimant,
he
had
to
go
through
procedures
before
the
commission
in
the
first
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
he
started
and
he
wants
to
make
the
best
possible
presentation
he
can,
but
where
does
he
get
a
lawyer
at
that
stage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
he
has
to
go
look
for
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
happen
very
often
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
if
he
goes--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
now,
if
he
goes
and
looks
for
one,
there
is
provision,
of
the
thing
ends
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
for
his
compensation,
what,
on
some
basis
of
a
reasonable
allowance,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
listen
--
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
what
we
decide
today,
which
deals
only,
as
i
understand
it,
with
this
provision
for
25%
in
the
case
of
a
court
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
what
we
decide
today
decide
anything
about
what's
reasonable
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
mean
--
will
he
get
the
--
will
counsel
now
get
an
award
of
fee
from
the
commissioner
and
if
he
then
has
to
go
to
court
also
get
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see.
i
guess
the
claimant
just
goes,
what,
to
a
local
uscs
office
or
something,
or
where
does
he
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
you
say
rights
to
have
a
hearing
and
rights
to
have
counsel.
that
is
one
of
the
circuit
writing
examiners
sends
him
a
notice
to
that
effect
that,
at
the
hearing,
he
may
have
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me
mr.
weinstein.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask,
but
at
that
hearing
level,
is
that
the
definitive
record
which
then
governs
the
proceeding
all
the
way
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
not
workman's
compensation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
disability
have
to
be
work-connected
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again
payable
out
of
any
award
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
there
is
no
award,
may
the
commissioner
make
an
allowance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
out
of
any
public
st
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
from
past-due
benefits
but
also
from
a
dependent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
recommend
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
it
doesn't
show
whether
these
claimants
found
their
way
to
the
oeo
office
on
their
own
or
whether
they
were
sent
there
by
the
agency,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
what's
the
panel
that
he
is
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
is
that
here
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
panel
that
functions
outside
of
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
in
that
connection,
mr.
weinstein,
i
think
you
told
us
yesterday
that
whatever
this
proceeding
is--
this
judicial
proceeding
is,
the
determination
is
made
on
the
agency
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
really
crucial
to
the
claimant's
whole
case
is
the
kind
of
record
that's
made
in
the
agency,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
when
evidence
is
taken
at
these
hearings
as
a
verbatim
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
to
understand
then
that
such
a
transcript,
under
agency
regulations,
is
required
when
the
hearing
is
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
413
of
the
first
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
then,
mr.
weinstein,
that
all
an
attorney
has
to
do
is
join
the
dependants
as
claimants
when
he
goes
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
it
arises.
do
i
correctly
understand
that,
under
the
statute,
the
dependants'
payments
depend
upon
a
finding
of
disability
of
the
father?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
under
what
circumstances
then
would
the
wife
and
children
ever
be
made
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
206
--
does
that
have
a
25%
limit,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
to
this
point,
mr.
gearinger,
you
haven't
said
anything
about
a
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
there
be
an
administrative
determination
of
a
denial
of
disability
without
a
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
precisely
what
was
the
alleged
disability
in
mr.
hopkins'
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how?
but
his
disability
had
not
arisen,
you
have
already
said
that
i
think,
from
any
industrial
actions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
deterioration
or
something,
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
investigation?
in
this
instance,
do
investigators
go
around
and
see
mr.
hopkins'
physicians
or
how
do
they
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
his
instance,
did
that
result
in
a
finding
of
disability
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
any
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
he
is
not
an
employee
of
the
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
is
supposed
to
be
impartial,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can
remember,
in
practice,
being
familiar
with
hearings
like
this
in
strike
situations
where
you
had
the
problem
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
qualification
or
disqualification
for
benefits
of
the
strikers.
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
this
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
there,
mr.--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
sharp,
25%
of
the
past-due
benefits
which
i
gather
are
now
known,
is
that
right?
the
figure
is
known.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
much
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
benefits
are
77?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
fee
would
be
700
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
900
--
now,
of
course,
whatever
the
plaintiffs,
defendants
may
ultimately
be
entitled
to
can't
be
determined
until
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
did
not
determine
any
amount,
did
it?
it
couldn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
my
question
then
is
how
is
the
25%,
if
it's
to
be
enhanced
above
the
$900,
again,
it's
25%
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
25%
or
is
that
the
100%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see,
so
then
it'd
be
25%
of
that
amount
plus
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
total
fee
on
your
submission
would
be
around
$2,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rather
than
the
$900.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
those
are
ordinarily
fees
which
are
in
addition
to
awards,
aren't
they?
they're
not
taken
from
the
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
a
--
this
is
taken
out
of
the
award,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
suppose
this
awards
made
by
the
district
judge
doesn't
necessarily
reflect,
does
it,
any
compensation
for
a
work
on
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sharp,
i
take
it
pres
--
did
counsel
ever
get
into
the
proceedings
before
the
examiner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
they?
do
you
know?
plus,
there's
no
provision,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but,
i
gather,
unless
you
have
to
reduce
something
to
judgment
in
the
district
court,
there's
no
provision
for
compensation
for
services
before
the
commissioner,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is?
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
counsel
fees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
the
secretary
assures
that
every
claimant
will
have
a
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering.
how
does
counsel
get
in,
though,
how
--
into
the
proceeding
in
the
first
instance?
does
he
have
to
be
retained
counsel
or
how
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
i
take
it
a
claimant
--
as
a
claimant,
he
had
to
go
through
procedures
before
the
commission
in
the
first
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
he
started
and
he
wants
to
make
the
best
possible
presentation
he
can,
but
where
does
he
get
a
lawyer
at
that
stage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
he
has
to
go
look
for
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
happen
very
often
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
if
he
goes--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
now,
if
he
goes
and
looks
for
one,
there
is
provision,
of
the
thing
ends
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
for
his
compensation,
what,
on
some
basis
of
a
reasonable
allowance,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
listen
--
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
what
we
decide
today,
which
deals
only,
as
i
understand
it,
with
this
provision
for
25%
in
the
case
of
a
court
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
what
we
decide
today
decide
anything
about
what's
reasonable
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
mean
--
will
he
get
the
--
will
counsel
now
get
an
award
of
fee
from
the
commissioner
and
if
he
then
has
to
go
to
court
also
get
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see.
i
guess
the
claimant
just
goes,
what,
to
a
local

or
where
does

go?
justice

again
payable

j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
what's
the
panel
that
he
is
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
is
that
here
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
panel
that
functions
outside
of
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
in
that
connection,
mr.
weinstein,
i
think
you
told
us
yesterday
that
whatever
this
proceeding
is--
this
judicial
proceeding
is,
the
determination
is
made
on
the
agency
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
really
crucial
to
the
claimant's
whole
case
is
the
kind
of
record
that's
made
in
the
agency,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
when
evidence
is
taken
at
these
hearings
as
a
verbatim
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
to
understand
then
that
such
a
transcript,
under
agency
regulations,
is
required
when
the
hearing
is
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
413
of
the
first
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
then,
mr.
weinstein,
that
all
an
attorney
has
to
do
is
join
the
dependants
as
claimants
when
he
goes
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
it
arises.
do
i
correctly
understand
that,
under
the
statute,
the
dependants'
payments
depend
upon
a
finding
of
disability
of
the
father?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
under
what
circumstances
then
would
the
wife
and
children
ever
be
made
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
206
--
does
that
have
a
25%
limit,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
to
this
point,
mr.
gearinger,
you
haven't
said
anything
about
a
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
there
be
an
administrative
determination
of
a
denial
of
disability
without
a
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
precisely
what
was
the
alleged
disability
in
mr.
hopkins'
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how?
but
his
disability
had
not
arisen,
you
have
already
said
that
i
think,
from
any
industrial
actions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
deterioration
or
something,
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
investigation?
in
this
instance,
do
investigators
go
around
and
see
mr.
hopkins'
physicians
or
how
do
they
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
his
instance,
did
that
result
in
a
finding
of
disability
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
any
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
he
is
not
an
employee
of
the
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
is
supposed
to
be
impartial,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can
remember,
in
practice,
being
familiar
with
hearings
like
this
in
strike
situations
where
you
had
the
problem
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
qualification
or
disqualification
for
benefits
of
the
strikers.
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
this
is?
