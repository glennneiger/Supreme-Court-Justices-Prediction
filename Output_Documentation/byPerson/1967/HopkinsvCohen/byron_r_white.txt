lawyers

the

isn't

all
that
he
can
collect
from
the
claimant,
according

up

25%
of

recovery,
do
you
think
the

precludes
him
from
collecting
privately
anything
from

where
do
you

yes,

if
the
lawyer
takes
the

suit

has
an
arrangement
with
him,
he
can
collect
from
him
and
have
it
withheld
from
the
benefits
up
to
25%,
and
you
say
either
the
statute

the
regulations
make
it
quite
clear
that
the

would
be
forbidden
to
pay
him
anything

that

taking

you
