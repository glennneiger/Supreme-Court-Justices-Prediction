your

you

the
last

justice

alright,
thank
you.
justice

black
you
say
not
in
this
court,
was
it
the
claim
below?
justice

black
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
percentage
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
survived.
who
is
“they?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
the
responsibility
of
the
examiner
in
the
situation?
is
he
--
is
it
a
part
of
his
responsibility
to
look
after
the
interests
of
the
claimant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
amount
of
fees
to
be
paid
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
whether
it
can
be
measured
by
the
fee
or
the
amount
paid
to
claimant
alone
about
the
other
beneficiaries
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
family
beneficiary
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
issue
that's
on
defense
that
is
presented
in
any
way
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
amount
on
which
the
government
claims
this
fee
must
be
computed
is
the
amount
paid
to
the
person
who's
actually
injured
rather
than
to
his
family?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
dependant
to
whom
money
is
separately
payable
who
are
overage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
she
has
started
anything
under
the
law
as
a
dependant,
separately.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
age
of
22.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
governmental
agency
pays
money
to
a
wife
where
her
husband
is
injured,
as
the
de
--
the
wife
as
a
dependant,
which
agency
and
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that--
what
you
previously
said.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
children
have
a
separate
amount
of
money
payable
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
they
be
claimants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
all
claimants
decided
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
may
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
hadn't
understood
that
up
to
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
weren't
they
all
not
together
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather
from
you,
this
law,
insofar
as
payments
are
concerned
to
the
man
who's
injured
and
his
beneficiaries,
is
very
much
like
federal
employer's
liability,
i
think.
they
are
the
--
you
have
certain
amounts
for
the
husband
if
he's
injured
or
killed,
certain
amounts
for
his
beneficiaries,
and
it's
all
conducted
in
one
litigation
and
contingent
fees
are
constantly
used
in
that
field
which
i
--
and
i'm
wondering
if
you
found
whether
there's
been
any
claims
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
nature
with
fela.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
claims
are
--
the
claim
is
of
this
nature
because
they
depend
on
children
getting
a
certain
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
acting
within
their
authority,
were
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
that
what
happened
to
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
applies
and
they
turned
him
down.
he
had
to
go
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
the
check
was
sent
to
him
or
his
manager?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
cash
and
use
the
money
on
his
own.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could
get
the
money
himself
and
had
it
in
his
disposal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
what
age
do
the
children
receive
these
benefits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
how
long
they're
entitled
to
it
under
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
make
a
pretty
serious
charge
there,
i
think,
to
that
need
examiners
satisfy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
satisfy
--
to
satisfy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
in
case
if
you
drove
here,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you.
suppose
the
claim
was
that
he
had
his
left
foot
cutoff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
considered.
that
would
not
be
filed
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
drove
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
used
it
as
a
statement
though
which
you
reflected
very
seriously
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
a
group
of
people
who
are
perhaps
as
honest
as
any
other
group
of
individuals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
challenge
your
answer
to
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
can
you
tell
me
what
relevance
did
that
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
issue
that
we
have
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
how
much
fee
will
be
under
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
all
the
claimants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
did
your
lawyer
have
an
agreement
with
these
other
beneficiaries
who
congress
has
tried
to
take
care
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
would
be
held
responsible
so
their
claim
would
be
subject
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
interested
in
is
what
authority
did
he
have
to
sign
away
the
rights
of
these
other
claimants
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
they
didn't
sign?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
“presumably,”
but
what
authority
did
he
have
to
sign
it
for
his
minor
children
and
his
wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
she's
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
the
signatory
but,
as
i
understand
from
the
government,
it
has
provided
separate
sums
of
benefits
for
the
children.
and,
you're
asking
that,
without
any
agreement
on
their
part
or
anyone
acting
for
them,
they
be
subjected
to
a
lawyer's
fee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
signing
their
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
their
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
that
involved
whether
these
children's
properties
that
the
government
has
provided
for
them
shall
be
subjected
to
attorney's
fees
by
reason
of
a
contract
made
by
their
father
who
is
not
their
guardian.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
alright.
he
was
not
their
legal
guardian,
was
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
yet
heard,
maybe
it's
not
in
the
record,
it's
not
yet
mentioned,
has
this
man
been
given
payment
on
the
basis
of
the
total
permanent
incapacity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
depends
on
whether
he's
injured,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
disability
was
found
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
totally
disabled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
hernia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
heard
about
the
other
things
yet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you.
that's
the
only
issue
here.
justice
hugo

it
would

we've
been
going
around
pretty
much.
