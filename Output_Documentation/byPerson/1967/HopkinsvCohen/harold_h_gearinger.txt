mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
without
attempting
to
qualify
myself
as
a
more
expert,
given
this
field,
than
mr.
weinstein,
i
do
have
some
environmental
and
circumstantial
advantages,
in
that,
i
was
in
the
pit
in
these
cases
and
all
the
way
through
from
the
administrative
level.
we
have
a
saying,
if
the
court
please,
in
my
area
and
mr.
justice
fortas's
area,
very
sagle
judge
who
once
said
to
me,
“tell
it
like
it
is.”
and,
if
i
may,
justice
brennan,
and
with
the
pleasure
of
the
court,
let
me
very
briefly
outline
the
exact
procedural
steps
that
are
involved
in
the
background
of
this
particular
narrow
question
here
today.
the
disability
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
not
necessarily
to
have
resulted
from
any
industrial
accident.
it
can
be
from
sickness.
the
substantive
decisions
under
who
is
disabled
or
voluminous
in
the
reports.
that
particular
substantive
question
concerns,
i
would
say,
95%
of
the
cases
that
reached
the
district
court
and
certainly
100%
of
the
cases
that
reach
the
appellate
courts.
to
begin
with,
a
man
who
considers
himself,
let's
take
mr.
x
and
mrs.
x
and
three
minor
children
under
the
age
of
seniority,
under
the
age
of
17,
and
he
has,
as
in
this
case,
a
very
limited
formal
education
and
has
done
a
menial
task
all
his
life.
and,
let
us
assume
that
he
has
some
demonstratable
disablement
and
he
goes
to
the
local
district
office
of
the
social
security
administration
where
he
is
confronted
by
a
clerk
who
inquires
as
of
his
name,
his
address,
his
age,
his
genealogy,
his
wife's
name,
and
his
children's
names.
at
that
particular
point
--
and
this
is
by
statute,
at
that
particular
point,
there
is
an
application
made
by
mr.
x,
an
application
made
by
mrs.
x,
and
an
application
made
by
mr.
x
for
his
minor
children,
so
that
there
are
then
before
the
administrative
agency
three
claims.
the
next
step
in
this
hierarchy
is
for
the
social
security
administration
at
the
field
level
to
investigate
these
circumstances
with
field
operators.
let
us
assume
that
mr.
x
receives
adverse
consideration
all
along
this
administrative
line
until
he
reaches
this
court,
and
i
think
mr.
--
if
the
court
please,
this
is
important
to
understand
the
specific
question
that
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
now
posed
in
this
--
alright,
sir?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black,
what
i'm
doing,
if
the
court
please,
is
to
online
to
you
what
not
only
happened
to
mr.
hopkins
but
happens
to
every
one
of
the
countless
thousands
who
apply
for
social
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
haven't
yet
come
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
black.
there
are
many
administrative
steps
in
which
he's
unrepresented
before
we
reach
that
goal,
sir.
what
then
happens
is
an
investigation
is
made,
and
to
be
very
brief
about
the
administrative
procedures
because
they're
not
too
apt
here.
he
gets
a
denial.
in
other
words,
based
on
mr.
justice
brennan
on
his
not
being
disabled,
there
is
no
passing
upon
the
question
of
the
entitlement
to
the
wife
and
children.
they
would
get
nothing
if
he
is
not
disabled.
so,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
the
disability
of
the
primary
head
of
family
claimant
on
which
this
entire
issue
turns.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
i'm
coming
to
that,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
oh,
yes,
sir.
much
before
you
get
to
the
hearing.
for
example,
they
come
in
this
chronology,
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
makes
his
application.
there
is
an
investigation
made
in
which
he
does
nothing
more
than
sign
his
name.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
mr.
hopkins'
case,
i'm
of
counsel
and
there
were
a
number
of
medical
disabilities
here,
the
substantive
decision
on
which
was
favorable
to
mr.
hopkins,
and
he
was
considered
to
be
disabled
under
the
act.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
it
could
have.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
suffered
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
suffered
a
hernia.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
vocational
experience
was
such
that,
in
the
condition
he
found
himself
when
he
applied,
there
was
no
employer
who
would
hire
him.
he
was
broken
then.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
go
around
and
investigate
in
the
neighborhood.
they
have
what's
called
a
contact
man
who
makes
a
house-to-house
investigation
and
that
person,
that
clerk,
then
makes
a
report.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
this
case,
your
honor,
mr.
hopkins
was
awarded
these
benefits
because
he
was
administratively,
at
the
outset,
determined
to
be
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
without
any
hearing
and,
as
a
consequence,
he
received
one
check
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
a
separate
check
to
him
for
the
use
of
his
minor
children,
as
result
to
this
determination.
but,
let
us
assume
for
the
purposes
of
illustration
and
for
complete
understanding
of
the
exact
problem
here
today
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
is
supposed
to
use
it
for
the
support
of
his
family.
that's
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
and
that's
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
oh!
yes,
sir.
he
being
responsible
for
the
care
of
his
minor
children
under
this
act.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
numerically,
i
believe
it's
to
21.
however,
in
these
families,
if
the
court
please,
we
usually
find
by
practical
experience
in
the
class
of
people
who
apply
for
these
benefits
the
daughter
marries
and
becomes
emancipated,
the
young
man
goes
in
the
army,
the
navy,
the
marine
core.
so
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
under
the
law,
until
they
reach
their
majority,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
or
become
self-maintaining.
let
us,
if
the
court
please,
go
on
to
the
very
next
step
so
we
can
see
how
this
hearing
examiner
acts
which
is
the
pivotal
point
here.
let
us
say
that
mr.
x
is
denied
administratively.
he
then
is
told
by
the
agency
that
he
may
ask
for
reconsideration.
that's
the
next
step.
he
asks
for
reconsideration
and
the
early
denial
is
affirmed.
he
then
is
told
in
formal
fashion
that
he
may
request
a
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner.
the
hearing
examiner
then
sets
it
down
for
a
hearing
and,
at
this
point,
without
going
a
step
further,
the
court
has
inquired
very
pertinently
what
is
the
duty
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
a
judicial
evaluation
of
that
hearing
examiner's
position
is
very
apt
here.
for
example,
judge
hemphill
in
columbia,
south
carolina,
in
robinson
versus
celebrezze
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
says
this,
“the
statute
provides
a
ridiculous
maximum
fee
for
compensation
of
counsel
at
the
hearing
level
where
the
determination
may
well
shape
the
course
of
the
remaining
years
of
a
tired
life
well
spent
dedicatedly
given
at
the
looms
of
industry.
if
the
hearing
examiner
within
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
appointed
through
the
civil
service
rules,
if
the
hearing
examiner
acts
as
judge,
jury,
prosecutor
of
the
claimant,
an
advocate
for
the
secretary,
the
unrepresented
claimant
is
beat
before
he
starts.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
if
he
does.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
is
given
such
discretion,
if
the
court
please,
that
he
can
act
in
any
one
of
those
categories
or
in
all
of
those
categories
simultaneously.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
a
most
subtle
fashion
and
may
i
relate,
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please,
my
own
experiences
at
that
level.
there
have
come
to
my
office
many
cases
after
the
unrepresented
claimant
and
his
family
had
appeared
before
the
hearing
examiner.
they
have
now
received
a
notice
that
the
appeals
counsel
sitting
in
washington
has
affirmed
the
hearing
examiner's
denial
of
disability
and,
therefore,
the
denial
of
benefits
to
the
entire
family.
and,
he
comes
in
and
said
“i
received
this
notice
and
i
think
it
says
something
about
a
court.”
the
statute
then
provides
that,
upon
the
final
denial
by
the
secretary
through
the
voice
of
the
appeals
counsel
sitting
here
in
washington,
within
60
days
in
a
jurisdictional
question
arises,
a
suit
may
be
filed
or
must
be
filed
within
60
days
in
a
federal
district
court.
this
is
the
point,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
most
of
us
at
the
bar
get
into
this
question.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
fortas.
he
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
he
is
selected,
and
i
know
this
because
i've
been
asked
to
be
one,
he
is
selected
from
a
pool
selected
by
the
civil
service
commission
and
certified
in
this
particular
field
or
in
any
other
field
like
most
of
hearing
examiners
are.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
he
is
employed
by
health,
education,
and
welfare
after
being
placed
upon
the
certified
role
of
candidates
by
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
a
similar
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
he
does
not
sit
there
as
an
independent
adjustor
between
two
adversaries.
there
is
no
adversary
proceeding
before
the
hearing
examiner.
there
is
the
hearing
examiner,
the
claimant
if
he's
unrepresented,
and
that
is
it.
that
is
all.
for
example
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
cannot
answer
that,
having
knowledge
of
how
they
think
in
the
proceeding
about--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
do
know,
if
the
court
please,
from
my
own
experience
that
this
happens,
and
i
see
this
in
record
after
record.
for
example,
from
the
substantive
question
of
disability,
i
would
venture
that
in
every
one
of
the
records
i
have
read,
there
is
questioning
by
the
hearing
examiner
of
the
head
of
family
claimant.
and,
one
of
the
questions
always
asked
is,
“how
did
you
come
here
this
morning?”
and
if
he
drove
there,
he's
not
disabled.
this
gets
into
each
record.
i
hesitate
to
say
these
things
because
some
of
my
best
friends
and
acquaintances
are
these
hearing
examiners.
i
admire
their
ability
but,
nevertheless,
we
are
confronted
with
this
record
which
then
cannot
be
heard
de
novo
by
a
district
court
but
can
only
be
reviewed
to
determine
if
there
is
any
evidence
in
that
record
to
support
the
secretary's
denial
of
benefits.
that's
the
test.
and,
by
that
time,
the
barn
door
hinges
have
rusted
and
the
mule
has
been
stolen
and
the
record
is
closed,
and
there's
very
little
that
can
be
done
by
an
attorney
because
the
court
cannot
entertain
any
new
evidence
at
that
level
at
all.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
wouldn't
be
considered
of
course,
your
honor.
i
was
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
no.
i
used
that
as
a
passing
illustration,
mr.
justice
black,
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
did
not
intend
it
to
be
that
way.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
they
are
indeed
--
indeed.
what
i
was
attempting
to
do,
mr.
justice
black,
was
to
respond
to
a
question
and
i
did
not
intend
to
say,
of
course
i
wouldn't
say,
that
that
is
the
sole
determining
factor
but
i
was
using
that
as
a
mere
illustration
of
the
question
and
answer
proceedings
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level.
most
of
those
hearing
examiners
do
a
magnificent
job.
i've
been
before
them
many
times.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
it
has
this
issue
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
and
i'll
get
to
that
point
immediately,
now
that
i
have
attempted
to
outline
this
administrative
procedure
which
prompted
some
questions
from
the
bench.
the
question
here
is
only
one
of
after
mr.
hopkins
was
represented
by
mr.
sharp
in
the
judicial
proceedings
and
was
successful
in
his
representation
of
that
family.
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
is,
very
simply
stated,
25%
which
is
the
maximum
not
to
exceed
that
and
not
necessarily
that,
but
not
to
exceed
25%
applied
to
the
base
of
only
that
which
was
paid
directly
to
and
for
mr.
hopkins,
not
including
the
benefits
derivatively
arrived
in
these
proceedings
to
mrs.
hopkins
and
the
dependant
children.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
and
in
the
sims
case,
which
is
pending
before
this
honorable
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
my
case,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
both
instances
is
that
the
clear
intent
of
the
congress
in
this
particular
statutory
provision
was
to
limit
a
district
judge
exercising
the
discretion
which
is
his,
having
seen
the
people,
heard
the
case,
and
in
a
better
position
to
evaluate
the
services
rendered,
to
set
a
fee
not
to
exceed
25%
of
the
benefits
resulting
from
the
judgment.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
of
it
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
in
this
hopkins
case,
and
of
course
i'm
here
as
of
counsel
in
this
case,
never
having
seen
mr.
hopkins
and
not
knowing
too
much
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
being
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
the
hopkins
case,
your
honor,
mr.
hopkins
was
the
head
of
the
family
who
signed
the
contingency
agreement
with
mr.
sharp,
along
with
mrs.
hopkins,
and
presumably
for
his
minor
children.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
his
wife
signed
it,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
oh,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
is
not
precisely,
mr.
justice
black.
may
i
say
this,
the
children
in
the
case
are,
of
course,
minors
and
they
proceed
through
the
office
of
their
father,
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
normal
circumstances,
under
the
law.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
for
their
benefit.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
payable
to
the
head
of
the
family,
mr.
justice
black,
for
their
benefit
of
course,
there
being
no
funds
here
to
get
any
guardian
appointed
or
being
no
necessity,
their
father
being
alive.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
we're
not.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
it
matters
not
whether
there
was
a
contingent
fee
agreement
or
not.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
right.
that
was
overcome
by
this
statute.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
who
was
their
natural
guardian,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
not
in
the
strict
legal
sense.
no,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
amount
of
legal
professional
work,
undoubtedly,
would
not
be
too
dissimilar.
they
would
be
almost
alike,
except
if
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level
if
he
were
in
--
if
he
were
representing
them
there,
he
would
of
course
call
upon
the
wife,
the
children,
the
neighbors,
or
anyone
else
to
appear
in
that
hearing
and,
herein,
testify.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
they
testify
as
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
and
testify
as
to
the
state
of
disability
of
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
most
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
hearing
is
conducted
on
exhibits
of
medical
reports
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
and
the
hearing
and
the
claimant,
so
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
not
on
the
substantive
question
of
the
disability
of
the
head
of
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
the
relationship
of
those
dependants
to
that
claimant
and
their
entitlement
as
his
dependants.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
children
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level,
that
is
the
only
difference.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
we
say
this,
your
honor,
that
because
the
substantive
question
of
disability
is
only
the
head
of
family
claimant
and
that
the
benefits
flowing
to
the
wife
and
any
dependants
he
may
have,
of
course,
is
insulary
to
a
determination
of
that
first
substantive
question.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
so
that,
they
would
have
no
benefits
had
he
not
been
found
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
a
practical
sense,
the
court
does
not
in
any
case
or
in
all
cases
automatically
grant
25%,
and
he
should
not.
he
should
not
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
your
honor,
i'm
trespassing
upon
my
time,
if
the
court
will
allow
any
longer?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
think
that
we
have
concerned
ourselves
and
i
apologize
for
concerning
myself
so
much
with
the
function
of
this
organization
and
not
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
submitted
to
the
court
yesterday
and,
if
the
court
please,
i
could
now
lodge
with
the
court
we
reproduced
numerous
copies
of
judge
coleman's
opinion
that
was
coming
at
point
from
this.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
position
of
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
on
my
happy
conscience,
your
honor,
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
them
lodged
with
the
clerk.
the
--
the
simple
and
final
position
in
this
case
of
the
government
on
one
hand,
and
the
petitioner's
on
the
other
is
that
we
say
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
not
to
divide
and
separate
bachelors
and
fathers
and
mothers
since
the
benefit
went
to
the
family
unit,
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
under
consideration
making
such
separation.
and,
in
that
connection,
the
petitioner
here
in
this
case
relies
and
urges
very
respectfully
of
this
court
the
position
and
interpretation
taken
by
chief
judge
hainsworth
in
the
fourth
circuit
as
being
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black,
unlike
workman's
compensation
by
percentages
of
permanent
disability
or
non-permanent
disability,
these
--
the
benefits
provided
by
the
social
security
act
are
measured
on
a
formula
concerning
the
payments
he
has
made
toward
the
trust
fund
and
his
eligibility
by
age
and
earning
capacity
in
the
past.
it's
automatically
computed.
it
depends
not
upon
a
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
it
depends
on
whether
he
is
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
this
case,
there
is
--
the
secretary
found
that
he
was
totally
disabled,
and
payment
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
under
--
and
a
number
of
other
things,
combined
together.
in
the
secretary's
determination,
the
administrative
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
well,
we
haven't
touched
upon
those,
mr.
justice
black,
because
the
secretary
has
decided
he
was
disabled
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
that
decision.
the
court
found
he
was
disabled
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
that,
so
that
the
solitary
question
here
is
upon
what
base
does
the
district
judge
fix
a
percentage
fee.
that
is
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
the
only
issue,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
without
attempting
to
qualify
myself
as
a
more
expert,
given
this
field,
than
mr.
weinstein,
i
do
have
some
environmental
and
circumstantial
advantages,
in
that,
i
was
in
the
pit
in
these
cases
and
all
the
way
through
from
the
administrative
level.
we
have
a
saying,
if
the
court
please,
in
my
area
and
mr.
justice
fortas's
area,
very
sagle
judge
who
once
said
to
me,
“tell
it
like
it
is.”
and,
if
i
may,
justice
brennan,
and
with
the
pleasure
of
the
court,
let
me
very
briefly
outline
the
exact
procedural
steps
that
are
involved
in
the
background
of
this
particular
narrow
question
here
today.
the
disability
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
not
necessarily
to
have
resulted
from
any
industrial
accident.
it
can
be
from
sickness.
the
substantive
decisions
under
who
is
disabled
or
voluminous
in
the
reports.
that
particular
substantive
question
concerns,
i
would
say,
95%
of
the
cases
that
reached
the
district
court
and
certainly
100%
of
the
cases
that
reach
the
appellate
courts.
to
begin
with,
a
man
who
considers
himself,
let's
take
mr.
x
and
mrs.
x
and
three
minor
children
under
the
age
of
seniority,
under
the
age
of
17,
and
he
has,
as
in
this
case,
a
very
limited
formal
education
and
has
done
a
menial
task
all
his
life.
and,
let
us
assume
that
he
has
some
demonstratable
disablement
and
he
goes
to
the
local
district
office
of
the
social
security
administration
where
he
is
confronted
by
a
clerk
who
inquires
as
of
his
name,
his
address,
his
age,
his
genealogy,
his
wife's
name,
and
his
children's
names.
at
that
particular
point
--
and
this
is
by
statute,
at
that
particular
point,
there
is
an
application
made
by
mr.
x,
an
application
made
by
mrs.
x,
and
an
application
made
by
mr.
x
for
his
minor
children,
so
that
there
are
then
before
the
administrative
agency
three
claims.
the
next
step
in
this
hierarchy
is
for
the
social
security
administration
at
the
field
level
to
investigate
these
circumstances
with
field
operators.
let
us
assume
that
mr.
x
receives
adverse
consideration
all
along
this
administrative
line
until
he
reaches
this
court,
and
i
think
mr.
--
if
the
court
please,
this
is
important
to
understand
the
specific
question
that
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
now
posed
in
this
--
alright,
sir?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black,
what
i'm
doing,
if
the
court
please,
is
to
online
to
you
what
not
only
happened
to
mr.
hopkins
but
happens
to
every
one
of
the
countless
thousands
who
apply
for
social
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
haven't
yet
come
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
black.
there
are
many
administrative
steps
in
which
he's
unrepresented
before
we
reach
that
goal,
sir.
what
then
happens
is
an
investigation
is
made,
and
to
be
very
brief
about
the
administrative
procedures
because
they're
not
too
apt
here.
he
gets
a
denial.
in
other
words,
based
on
mr.
justice
brennan
on
his
not
being
disabled,
there
is
no
passing
upon
the
question
of
the
entitlement
to
the
wife
and
children.
they
would
get
nothing
if
he
is
not
disabled.
so,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
the
disability
of
the
primary
head
of
family
claimant
on
which
this
entire
issue
turns.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
i'm
coming
to
that,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
oh,
yes,
sir.
much
before
you
get
to
the
hearing.
for
example,
they
come
in
this
chronology,
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
makes
his
application.
there
is
an
investigation
made
in
which
he
does
nothing
more
than
sign
his
name.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
mr.
hopkins'
case,
i'm
of
counsel
and
there
were
a
number
of
medical
disabilities
here,
the
substantive
decision
on
which
was
favorable
to
mr.
hopkins,
and
he
was
considered
to
be
disabled
under
the
act.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
it
could
have.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
suffered
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
suffered
a
hernia.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
vocational
experience
was
such
that,
in
the
condition
he
found
himself
when
he
applied,
there
was
no
employer
who
would
hire
him.
he
was
broken
then.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
go
around
and
investigate
in
the
neighborhood.
they
have
what's
called
a
contact
man
who
makes
a
house-to-house
investigation
and
that
person,
that
clerk,
then
makes
a
report.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
this
case,
your
honor,
mr.
hopkins
was
awarded
these
benefits
because
he
was
administratively,
at
the
outset,
determined
to
be
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
without
any
hearing
and,
as
a
consequence,
he
received
one
check
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
a
separate
check
to
him
for
the
use
of
his
minor
children,
as
result
to
this
determination.
but,
let
us
assume
for
the
purposes
of
illustration
and
for
complete
understanding
of
the
exact
problem
here
today
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
is
supposed
to
use
it
for
the
support
of
his
family.
that's
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
and
that's
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
oh!
yes,
sir.
he
being
responsible
for
the
care
of
his
minor
children
under
this
act.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
numerically,
i
believe
it's
to
21.
however,
in
these
families,
if
the
court
please,
we
usually
find
by
practical
experience
in
the
class
of
people
who
apply
for
these
benefits
the
daughter
marries
and
becomes
emancipated,
the
young
man
goes
in
the
army,
the
navy,
the
marine
core.
so
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
under
the
law,
until
they
reach
their
majority,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
or
become
self-maintaining.
let
us,
if
the
court
please,
go
on
to
the
very
next
step
so
we
can
see
how
this
hearing
examiner
acts
which
is
the
pivotal
point
here.
let
us
say
that
mr.
x
is
denied
administratively.
he
then
is
told
by
the
agency
that
he
may
ask
for
reconsideration.
that's
the
next
step.
he
asks
for
reconsideration
and
the
early
denial
is
affirmed.
he
then
is
told
in
formal
fashion
that
he
may
request
a
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner.
the
hearing
examiner
then
sets
it
down
for
a
hearing
and,
at
this
point,
without
going
a
step
further,
the
court
has
inquired
very
pertinently
what
is
the
duty
of
the
hearing
examiner
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
a
judicial
evaluation
of
that
hearing
examiner's
position
is
very
apt
here.
for
example,
judge
hemphill
in
columbia,
south
carolina,
in
robinson
versus
celebrezze
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
says
this,
“the
statute
provides
a
ridiculous
maximum
fee
for
compensation
of
counsel
at
the
hearing
level
where
the
determination
may
well
shape
the
course
of
the
remaining
years
of
a
tired
life
well
spent
dedicatedly
given
at
the
looms
of
industry.
if
the
hearing
examiner
within
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
appointed
through
the
civil
service
rules,
if
the
hearing
examiner
acts
as
judge,
jury,
prosecutor
of
the
claimant,
an
advocate
for
the
secretary,
the
unrepresented
claimant
is
beat
before
he
starts.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
if
he
does.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
is
given
such
discretion,
if
the
court
please,
that
he
can
act
in
any
one
of
those
categories
or
in
all
of
those
categories
simultaneously.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
a
most
subtle
fashion
and
may
i
relate,
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please,
my
own
experiences
at
that
level.
there
have
come
to
my
office
many
cases
after
the
unrepresented
claimant
and
his
family
had
appeared
before
the
hearing
examiner.
they
have
now
received
a
notice
that
the
appeals
counsel
sitting
in
washington
has
affirmed
the
hearing
examiner's
denial
of
disability
and,
therefore,
the
denial
of
benefits
to
the
entire
family.
and,
he
comes
in
and
said
“i
received
this
notice
and
i
think
it
says
something
about
a
court.”
the
statute
then
provides
that,
upon
the
final
denial
by
the
secretary
through
the
voice
of
the
appeals
counsel
sitting
here
in
washington,
within
60
days
in
a
jurisdictional
question
arises,
a
suit
may
be
filed
or
must
be
filed
within
60
days
in
a
federal
district
court.
this
is
the
point,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
most
of
us
at
the
bar
get
into
this
question.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
fortas.
he
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
he
is
selected,
and
i
know
this
because
i've
been
asked
to
be
one,
he
is
selected
from
a
pool
selected
by
the
civil
service
commission
and
certified
in
this
particular
field
or
in
any
other
field
like
most
of
hearing
examiners
are.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
he
is
employed
by
health,
education,
and
welfare
after
being
placed
upon
the
certified
role
of
candidates
by
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
a
similar
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
he
does
not
sit
there
as
an
independent
adjustor
between
two
adversaries.
there
is
no
adversary
proceeding
before
the
hearing
examiner.
there
is
the
hearing
examiner,
the
claimant
if
he's
unrepresented,
and
that
is
it.
that
is
all.
for
example
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
cannot
answer
that,
having
knowledge
of
how
they
think
in
the
proceeding
about--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
do
know,
if
the
court
please,
from
my
own
experience
that
this
happens,
and
i
see
this
in
record
after
record.
for
example,
from
the
substantive
question
of
disability,
i
would
venture
that
in
every
one
of
the
records
i
have
read,
there
is
questioning
by
the
hearing
examiner
of
the
head
of
family
claimant.
and,
one
of
the
questions
always
asked
is,
“how
did
you
come
here
this
morning?”
and
if
he
drove
there,
he's
not
disabled.
this
gets
into
each
record.
i
hesitate
to
say
these
things
because
some
of
my
best
friends
and
acquaintances
are
these
hearing
examiners.
i
admire
their
ability
but,
nevertheless,
we
are
confronted
with
this
record
which
then
cannot
be
heard
de
novo
by
a
district
court
but
can
only
be
reviewed
to
determine
if
there
is
any
evidence
in
that
record
to
support
the
secretary's
denial
of
benefits.
that's
the
test.
and,
by
that
time,
the
barn
door
hinges
have
rusted
and
the
mule
has
been
stolen
and
the
record
is
closed,
and
there's
very
little
that
can
be
done
by
an
attorney
because
the
court
cannot
entertain
any
new
evidence
at
that
level
at
all.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
wouldn't
be
considered
of
course,
your
honor.
i
was
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
no.
i
used
that
as
a
passing
illustration,
mr.
justice
black,
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
did
not
intend
it
to
be
that
way.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
they
are
indeed
--
indeed.
what
i
was
attempting
to
do,
mr.
justice
black,
was
to
respond
to
a
question
and
i
did
not
intend
to
say,
of
course
i
wouldn't
say,
that
that
is
the
sole
determining
factor
but
i
was
using
that
as
a
mere
illustration
of
the
question
and
answer
proceedings
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level.
most
of
those
hearing
examiners
do
a
magnificent
job.
i've
been
before
them
many
times.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
it
has
this
issue
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
and
i'll
get
to
that
point
immediately,
now
that
i
have
attempted
to
outline
this
administrative
procedure
which
prompted
some
questions
from
the
bench.
the
question
here
is
only
one
of
after
mr.
hopkins
was
represented
by
mr.
sharp
in
the
judicial
proceedings
and
was
successful
in
his
representation
of
that
family.
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
is,
very
simply
stated,
25%
which
is
the
maximum
not
to
exceed
that
and
not
necessarily
that,
but
not
to
exceed
25%
applied
to
the
base
of
only
that
which
was
paid
directly
to
and
for
mr.
hopkins,
not
including
the
benefits
derivatively
arrived
in
these
proceedings
to
mrs.
hopkins
and
the
dependant
children.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
and
in
the
sims
case,
which
is
pending
before
this
honorable
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
my
case,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
both
instances
is
that
the
clear
intent
of
the
congress
in
this
particular
statutory
provision
was
to
limit
a
district
judge
exercising
the
discretion
which
is
his,
having
seen
the
people,
heard
the
case,
and
in
a
better
position
to
evaluate
the
services
rendered,
to
set
a
fee
not
to
exceed
25%
of
the
benefits
resulting
from
the
judgment.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
of
it
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
in
this
hopkins
case,
and
of
course
i'm
here
as
of
counsel
in
this
case,
never
having
seen
mr.
hopkins
and
not
knowing
too
much
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
he
being
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
the
hopkins
case,
your
honor,
mr.
hopkins
was
the
head
of
the
family
who
signed
the
contingency
agreement
with
mr.
sharp,
along
with
mrs.
hopkins,
and
presumably
for
his
minor
children.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
his
wife
signed
it,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
oh,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
is
not
precisely,
mr.
justice
black.
may
i
say
this,
the
children
in
the
case
are,
of
course,
minors
and
they
proceed
through
the
office
of
their
father,
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
normal
circumstances,
under
the
law.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
for
their
benefit.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
payable
to
the
head
of
the
family,
mr.
justice
black,
for
their
benefit
of
course,
there
being
no
funds
here
to
get
any
guardian
appointed
or
being
no
necessity,
their
father
being
alive.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
we're
not.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
it
matters
not
whether
there
was
a
contingent
fee
agreement
or
not.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
right.
that
was
overcome
by
this
statute.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
who
was
their
natural
guardian,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
sir.
not
in
the
strict
legal
sense.
no,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
amount
of
legal
professional
work,
undoubtedly,
would
not
be
too
dissimilar.
they
would
be
almost
alike,
except
if
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level
if
he
were
in
--
if
he
were
representing
them
there,
he
would
of
course
call
upon
the
wife,
the
children,
the
neighbors,
or
anyone
else
to
appear
in
that
hearing
and,
herein,
testify.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
they
testify
as
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
and
testify
as
to
the
state
of
disability
of
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
most
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
hearing
is
conducted
on
exhibits
of
medical
reports
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
and
the
hearing
and
the
claimant,
so
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
not
on
the
substantive
question
of
the
disability
of
the
head
of
family.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
the
relationship
of
those
dependants
to
that
claimant
and
their
entitlement
as
his
dependants.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
children
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
at
the
hearing
examiner's
level,
that
is
the
only
difference.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
we
say
this,
your
honor,
that
because
the
substantive
question
of
disability
is
only
the
head
of
family
claimant
and
that
the
benefits
flowing
to
the
wife
and
any
dependants
he
may
have,
of
course,
is
insulary
to
a
determination
of
that
first
substantive
question.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
so
that,
they
would
have
no
benefits
had
he
not
been
found
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
a
practical
sense,
the
court
does
not
in
any
case
or
in
all
cases
automatically
grant
25%,
and
he
should
not.
he
should
not
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
your
honor,
i'm
trespassing
upon
my
time,
if
the
court
will
allow
any
longer?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
i
think
that
we
have
concerned
ourselves
and
i
apologize
for
concerning
myself
so
much
with
the
function
of
this
organization
and
not
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
submitted
to
the
court
yesterday
and,
if
the
court
please,
i
could
now
lodge
with
the
court
we
reproduced
numerous
copies
of
judge
coleman's
opinion
that
was
coming
at
point
from
this.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
--
position
of
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
on
my
happy
conscience,
your
honor,
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
them
lodged
with
the
clerk.
the
--
the
simple
and
final
position
in
this
case
of
the
government
on
one
hand,
and
the
petitioner's
on
the
other
is
that
we
say
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
not
to
divide
and
separate
bachelors
and
fathers
and
mothers
since
the
benefit
went
to
the
family
unit,
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
under
consideration
making
such
separation.
and,
in
that
connection,
the
petitioner
here
in
this
case
relies
and
urges
very
respectfully
of
this
court
the
position
and
interpretation
taken
by
chief
judge
hainsworth
in
the
fourth
circuit
as
being
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
mr.
justice
black,
unlike
workman's
compensation
by
percentages
of
permanent
disability
or
non-permanent
disability,
these
--
the
benefits
provided
by
the
social
security
act
are
measured
on
a
formula
concerning
the
payments
he
has
made
toward
the
trust
fund
and
his
eligibility
by
age
and
earning
capacity
in
the
past.
it's
automatically
computed.
it
depends
not
upon
a
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
it
depends
on
whether
he
is
disabled.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
in
this
case,
there
is
--
the
secretary
found
that
he
was
totally
disabled,
and
payment
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
under
--
and
a
number
of
other
things,
combined
together.
in
the
secretary's
determination,
the
administrative
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
well,
we
haven't
touched
upon
those,
mr.
justice
black,
because
the
secretary
has
decided
he
was
disabled
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
that
decision.
the
court
found
he
was
disabled
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
that,
so
that
the
solitary
question
here
is
upon
what
base
does
the
district
judge
fix
a
percentage
fee.
that
is
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
that's
the
only
issue,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
h.
gearinger
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
