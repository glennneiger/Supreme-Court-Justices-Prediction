you
give
your

497?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
contingent
fee
arrangements
before
the
statute
was
passed
made
the
contingency
dependant
on
the
recovery
--
total
recovery
or
on
the
recovery
of
your
claimant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
those
contracts
have
to
be
filed
with
any
--
with
the
agency?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
dependant
could
join
him,
is
there
anything
written
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
have
a
derivative
--
they
have
a
derivative
controversy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
you
prevail
in
this
case,
would
there
be
any
reason
why
checking
--
in
order
the
amount
of
work
that
may
continue
these
contract
with
the
dependent's
satisfy
from
one
person
that
against
the
contract
and
many
other
things
you
consider
upon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
directly
against
the
father?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
the
lawyer
get
disbursement
from
part
of
the
fee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
just
to
prove
that
they
are
the
children.
that's
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
define
that
language,
as
your
adversary
referred
to,
who
were
those
two
gentlemen
with
paychecks
on
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
lawyers
are
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
lawyers
are
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
find
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
this
is,
i
take
it,
congress
had
gradually
fixed
the
fee.
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
maximum,
but
still
if
word
gets
out,
your
adversary
in
lieu
of
this
particular
case
would
be
in
order
to
the
amount
of
effort
to
spend
in
this
court
will
have
control
over
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
an
open-ended
issue
as
well.
justice
john
m.
harlan
incidentally,
it
might
be
irrelevant
at
the
administrative
level,
a
man
who
were
represented
by
a
non-lawyer,
is
that
non-lawyer
entitled
to
fees.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
result
from
the
case
that
the
court
would
exercise
some
discretion
for
this
person,
whereas
your
view
puts
a
limitation
on
the
court
in
a
situation
where,
as
you
yourself
said,
the
position
you're
taking
might
lose
on
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i'm
saying
is
it
does
not
mean
that
your
adversary
is
taking
--
it
does
not
mean
that
automatically
every
lawyer
is
going
to
get
25%
of
the
whole
lot.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
reliance
here
whatever
on
that
contingent
fee
agreement,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
we're
not
talking
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
signed
it
or
who
didn't
sign
it
or
anything
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know,
we're
talking
about
is
the
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
the
unreported
opinion
--
justice
john
m.

that
i
asked.
