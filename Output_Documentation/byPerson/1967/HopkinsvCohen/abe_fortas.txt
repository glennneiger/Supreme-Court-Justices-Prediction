justice
abe
fortas
you
compute
the
--
or
the
court
were
to
compute
the
benefits
for
this
purpose,
benefits
to
this
man's
wife
and
children.
justice
abe
fortas
for
how
much
more
did
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
right,
how
much
would
that
be
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sharp,
does
the
payment
come
out
of
the
claimant's
pocket
even
after
the
adminis
--
for
counsel
fees
even
at
the
administrative
level?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is,
he
may
have
counsel
if
he
can
afford
to
hire
one
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
used
one
who
was
taken
on
a
contingent
basis
despite
the
fact
that,
i
suppose,
a
great
many
if
not
most
of
these
claimants
are
indigents.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
--
that
would
be
totally
outside
of
the
federal
security
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
don't
have
any
arrangement
here
for
something
like
public
defender,
do
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
courts
have
to
proceed
on
that
record,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
department
of
justice
have
any
jurisdiction
over
this?
shall
i
say,
a
rather
stringent
or
astringent
procedure?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
no
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
advice
to
the
federal
security
agency
on
its
legal
procedure
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
these
cases,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
whether
you
have
jurisdiction
or
not.
justice
abe
fortas
while
you're
there,
aren't
you
t
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
this
dealing
in
part
with
the
man's
own
money?
hasn't
he
paid
money
into
social
security
fund
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
certain
type
of
insurance,
and
these
hearings
are
being
held
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
he's
entitled
to
benefits
for
which
in
part
he
has
paid?
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
documents,
to
which
you
just
referred,
on
file
with
us?
justice
abe
fortas
at
first
i
--
myself,
would
be
very
grateful
if
that
would
be
done.
may
i
ask
you
this,
are
the
examiners
chosen
under
--
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
are
they,
in
other
words,
selected
under
the
civil
service
procedures
or
are
they
employees
of
and
solely
responsible
to
the
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
would
assume
the
latter
and
i
do
wish
you
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
that.
now,
these
hearings
are
provided
by
statute,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
that
they
are
not
matters
of
administrative
race
but
congress
has
provided
for
them,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
it
your
understanding
that
they
are
or
are
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
substantive
hearing
too.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'd
appreciate
it,
if
that's
alright.
i'd
very
much
appreciate
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wonder
if
you
don't
have
two
questions.
one
who
is
the
claimant
and
accepting
your
point
but
the
claimant
is
the
claimant,
mr.
hopkins,
here.
they
--
don't
you
have
a
second
question
which
is,
what
is
the
claimant's
claim
on
the
basis
of
which
these
may
be
allowed?
and,
mr.
hopkins
claim
here,
i
take
it,
was
for
payments
not
only
to
himself
but
also
to
his
wife
and
to
his
children.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
this
court
action
is,
in
effect,
a
review
of
the
administrative
denials,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
when
mr.
hopkins
proceeded
administratively,
he
proceeded
only
on
behalf
of
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
what
makes
you
say
that?
why
do
you
say
that?
why
--
it
seem
to
me
that
if
the
statute
provides
that
mr.
hopkins,
if
he's
disabled,
is
entitled
to
benefits
and
that--
derivatively
from
that,
benefits
also
go
to
his
wife
and
his
children.
that
it's
certainly
arguable
that
what
hopkins
was
seeking
when
he
went
befor
the
agency
and
without
counsel,
was
payment
to
himself
and
to
his
wife
and
his
children.
justice
abe
fortas
we
don't
know,
do
we?
do
we
have
--
did
he
say
anything?
i
gather,
he's
not
an
uneducated
man.
what
is
he,
a
laborer?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
do
you
know
what
he
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
he
say
when
he
went
before
the
agency?
did
he
say
he
was
seeking
to
establish
his
rights
or
--
and
claim
payments
to
himself
or
on
behalf
on
himself,
his
wife,
and
his
children?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
his
claim
if
what
--
if
he
won
his
case
like
a
plaintiff
in
a
lawsuit,
if
he
won
his
case
they
would
follow,
from
the
judgment
in
his
favor,
certain
consequences.
and,
those
consequences
would
be
payments
not
only
to
him
but
to
his
wife
and
children.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
mr.
weinstein,
before
mr.
hopkins
won
his
lawsuit,
he
and
his
wife
and
dependants
children
were
receiving
about
something
under
9
--
$8,000.
then
--
and
i
mean
to
say
before
the
payments
were
stopped,
then
the
payments
--
let
me
withdraw
that
and
rephrase
it.
mr.
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
receiving
benefits
under
the
act.
then,
the
payment
of
those
benefits
was
stopped
because
of
the
conclusion
of
the
agency
that
his
disability
had
seized.
then
--
so,
mr.
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
receiving
zero.
then,
the
proceeding
was
brought
and,
in
the
court,
mr.
hopkins'
lawyer
managed
to
win
the
case.
then,
mr.
hopkins
was
entitled
as
--
and
his
wife
and
children
were
entitled
to
receive
approximately
$8,000
past-due
payments,
and
there
was
one
letter
written
to
mr.
hopkins,
which
appears
as
appendix
5
in
the
record
before
us,
one
letter
in
which
it
was
said
that
“we're
sending
you
a
combined
payment
--
a
check
for
combined
payment
for
you
and
your
wife,
$5,000,
and
the
children's
check
will
be
sent
to
you
shortly.”
is
it
--
so
that,
simple,
perhaps
over
simplified,
lawyer's
way
of
looking
at
this
thing,
but
mr.
hopkin
--
the
benefit
that
mr.
hopkins
received
as
a
result
of
his
claim
was
approximately
$8,000
and
the
ceiling
fixed
by
the
act
would
be
25%
of
that
total
recovery.
and,
that's
the
simplicity
of
it
and
i
admire
the
--
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
admire
your
--
the
way
you've
gone
about
this
to
arrive
in
another
construction
of
it.
but,
a
claimant
makes
a
claim
and
what
happened
here,
as
a
result
of
winning
the
litigation,
was
that
not
only
mr.
hopkins
but
his
wife
and
children
received
moneys.
and
then,
the
statute
says
that
the
lawyers
--
that
the
court
may
allow
the
lawyer
a
ma
--
a
fee
up
to
25%
of
the
recovery.
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
understand
that
because
the
lawyer
has
a
contingent
arrangement
with
the
client.
it
doesn't
say
--
you
don't
complicate
it
very
much.
you
find
out
what
the
judgment
of
the
court
was,
what
the
client
received,
what
was
the
recovery
in
the
litigation,
and
then
you
take
a
percentage
of
that.
now,
there
may
be
other
consequences
that
have
to
be
established
in
other
litigation,
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
normal
to
read
the
language
of
congress
in
the
ordinary
sense
that
lawyers
are
accustomed
to.
and,
when
congress
said
the
25
--
congress
talked
about
the
25%
limit,
it
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
total
recovery
in
that
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
gets
a
fee
only
if
he
wins.
is
that
right
before
the
agency,
too?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there's
no
possibility
of
two
fees
because
if
he
wins
once,
that's
it.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
justice
abe
fortas
if
--
i
don't
quite
understand
about
the
hearing
examiner.
is
he
a
hearing
examiner
in
the
same
sense
and
at
the
same
independence
of
tenure
and
so
on
that
the,
say,
the
hearing
examiner
at
the
labor
board
or
the
sec
has?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
his
one
of
the
civil
service
core
of
a
hearing
examiner.
justice
abe
fortas
please
start
off
here,
don't
you,
at
the
statutory
provision
that
limits
the
base
to
the
amount
of
past
benefits?
justice
abe
fortas
actually,
what
happens
here
if
a
lawyer
is
successful
is
that
mr.
hopkins
is
enti--
and
his
wife
and
children
are
entitled
not
only
to
pass
the
sums
but
to
payments
in
the
future.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
statute
provides
that
the
lawyer
is
confined
to
the
amount
that
is
received
before
mr.
hopkins
or
mr.
hopkins
et
al.
has
by
reason
of
past
accruals.
justice
abe
fortas
not
only
that,
then
you
have
a
25%
ceiling
on
that
base
and
then
you
have
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
cut
below
that
25%.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
abe
fortas
you
compute
the
--
or
the
court
were
to
compute
the
benefits
for
this
purpose,
benefits
to
this
man's
wife
and
children.
justice
abe
fortas
for
how
much
more
did
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
right,
how
much
would
that
be
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sharp,
does
the
payment
come
out
of
the
claimant's
pocket
even
after
the
adminis
--
for
counsel
fees
even
at
the
administrative
level?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is,
he
may
have
counsel
if
he
can
afford
to
hire
one
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
used
one
who
was
taken
on
a
contingent
basis
despite
the
fact
that,
i
suppose,
a
great
many
if
not
most
of
these
claimants
are
indigents.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
--
that
would
be
totally
outside
of
the
federal
security
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
don't
have
any
arrangement
here
for
something
like
public
defender,
do
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
courts
have
to
proceed
on
that
record,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
department
of
justice
have
any
jurisdiction
over
this?
shall
i
say,
a
rather
stringent
or
astringent
procedure?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
no
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
advice
to
the
federal
security
agency
on
its
legal
procedure
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
these
cases,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
whether
you
have
jurisdiction
or
not.
justice
abe
fortas
while
you're
there,
aren't
you
t
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
this
dealing
in
part
with
the
man's
own
money?
hasn't
he
paid
money
into
social
security
fund
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
certain
type
of
insurance,
and
these
hearings
are
being
held
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
he's
entitled
to
benefits
for
which
in
part
he
has
paid?
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
documents,
to
which
you
just
referred,
on
file
with
us?
justice
abe
fortas
at
first
i
--
myself,
would
be
very
grateful
if
that
would
be
done.
may
i
ask
you
this,
are
the
examiners
chosen
under
--
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
are
they,
in
other
words,
selected
under
the
civil
service
procedures
or
are
they
employees
of
and
solely
responsible
to
the
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
would
assume
the
latter
and
i
do
wish
you
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
that.
now,
these
hearings
are
provided
by
statute,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
that
they
are
not
matters
of
administrative
race
but
congress
has
provided
for
them,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
it
your
understanding
that
they
are
or
are
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
substantive
hearing
too.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'd
appreciate
it,
if
that's
alright.
i'd
very
much
appreciate
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wonder
if
you
don't
have
two
questions.
one
who
is
the
claimant
and
accepting
your
point
but
the
claimant
is
the
claimant,
mr.
hopkins,
here.
they
--
don't
you
have
a
second
question
which
is,
what
is
the
claimant's
claim
on
the
basis
of
which
these
may
be
allowed?
and,
mr.
hopkins
claim
here,
i
take
it,
was
for
payments
not
only
to
himself
but
also
to
his
wife
and
to
his
children.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
this
court
action
is,
in
effect,
a
review
of
the
administrative
denials,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
when
mr.
hopkins
proceeded
administratively,
he
proceeded
only
on
behalf
of
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
what
makes
you
say
that?
why
do
you
say
that?
why
--
it
seem
to
me
that
if
the
statute
provides
that
mr.
hopkins,
if
he's
disabled,
is
entitled
to
benefits
and
that--
derivatively
from
that,
benefits
also
go
to
his
wife
and
his
children.
that
it's
certainly
arguable
that
what
hopkins
was
seeking
when
he
went
befor
the
agency
and
without
counsel,
was
payment
to
himself
and
to
his
wife
and
his
children.
justice
abe
fortas
we
don't
know,
do
we?
do
we
have
--
did
he
say
anything?
i
gather,
he's
not
an
uneducated
man.
what
is
he,
a
laborer?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
do
you
know
what
he
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
he
say
when
he
went
before
the
agency?
did
he
say
he
was
seeking
to
establish
his
rights
or
--
and
claim
payments
to
himself
or
on
behalf
on
himself,
his
wife,
and
his
children?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
his
claim
if
what
--
if
he
won
his
case
like
a
plaintiff
in
a
lawsuit,
if
he
won
his
case
they
would
follow,
from
the
judgment
in
his
favor,
certain
consequences.
and,
those
consequences
would
be
payments
not
only
to
him
but
to
his
wife
and
children.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
mr.
weinstein,
before
mr.
hopkins
won
his
lawsuit,
he
and
his
wife
and
dependants
children
were
receiving
about
something
under
9
--
$8,000.
then
--
and
i
mean
to
say
before
the
payments
were
stopped,
then
the
payments
--
let
me
withdraw
that
and
rephrase
it.
mr.
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
receiving
benefits
under
the
act.
then,
the
payment
of
those
benefits
was
stopped
because
of
the
conclusion
of
the
agency
that
his
disability
had
seized.
then
--
so,
mr.
hopkins'
wife
and
children
were
receiving
zero.
then,
the
proceeding
was
brought
and,
in
the
court,
mr.
hopkins'
lawyer
managed
to
win
the
case.
then,
mr.
hopkins
was
entitled
as
--
and
his
wife
and
children
were
entitled
to
receive
approximately
$8,000
past-due
payments,
and
there
was
one
letter
written
to
mr.
hopkins,
which
appears
as
appendix
5
in
the
record
before
us,
one
letter
in
which
it
was
said
that
“we're
sending
you
a
combined
payment
--
a
check
for
combined
payment
for
you
and
your
wife,
$5,000,
and
the
children's
check
will
be
sent
to
you
shortly.”
is
it
--
so
that,
simple,
perhaps
over
simplified,
lawyer's
way
of
looking
at
this
thing,
but
mr.
hopkin
--
the
benefit
that
mr.
hopkins
received
as
a
result
of
his
claim
was
approximately
$8,000
and
the
ceiling
fixed
by
the
act
would
be
25%
of
that
total
recovery.
and,
that's
the
simplicity
of
it
and
i
admire
the
--
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
admire
your
--
the
way
you've
gone
about
this
to
arrive
in
another
construction
of
it.
but,
a
claimant
makes
a
claim
and
what
happened
here,
as
a
result
of
winning
the
litigation,
was
that
not
only
mr.
hopkins
but
his
wife
and
children
received
moneys.
and
then,
the
statute
says
that
the
lawyers
--
that
the
court
may
allow
the
lawyer
a
ma
--
a
fee
up
to
25%
of
the
recovery.
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
understand
that
because
the
lawyer
has
a
contingent
arrangement
with
the
client.
it
doesn't
say
--
you
don't
complicate
it
very
much.
you
find
out
what
the
judgment
of
the
court
was,
what
the
client
received,
what
was
the
recovery
in
the
litigation,
and
then
you
take
a
percentage
of
that.
now,
there
may
be
other
consequences
that
have
to
be
established
in
other
litigation,
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
normal
to
read
the
language
of
congress
in
the
ordinary
sense
that
lawyers
are
accustomed
to.
and,
when
congress
said
the
25
--
congress
talked
about
the
25%
limit,
it
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
total
recovery
in
that
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
gets
a
fee
only
if
he
wins.
is
that
right
before
the
agency,
too?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there's
no
possibility
of
two
fees
because
if
he
wins
once,
that's
it.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
justice
abe
fortas
if
--
i
don't
quite
understand
about
the
hearing
examiner.
is
he
a
hearing
examiner
in
the
same
sense
and
at
the
same
independence
of
tenure
and
so
on
that
the,
say,
the
hearing
examiner
at
the
labor
board
or
the
sec
has?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
his
one
of
the
civil
service
core
of
a
hearing
examiner.
justice
abe
fortas
please
start
off
here,
don't
you,
at
the
statutory
provision
that
limits
the
base
to
the
amount
of
past
benefits?
justice
abe
fortas
actually,
what
happens
here
if
a
lawyer
is
successful
is
that
mr.
hopkins
is
enti--
and
his
wife
and
children
are
entitled
not
only
to
pass
the
sums
but
to
payments
in
the
future.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
statute
provides
that
the
lawyer
is
confined
to
the
amount
that
is
received
before
mr.
hopkins
or
mr.
hopkins
et
al.
has
by
reason
of
past
accruals.
justice
abe
fortas
not
only
that,
then
you
have
a
25%
ceiling
on
that
base
and
then
you
have
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
cut
below
that
25%.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
way
it
works?
