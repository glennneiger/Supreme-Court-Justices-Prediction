how
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
administrative
search
and
other
kinds
of
searches?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
regulation
was
all
right,
a
valid
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
happen
to
see
something
in
there
it
was
admissible
evidence,
they
couldn't
use
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
whole
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you'd
pull
up
the
--
suppose
the
trunk
had
been
opened
and
they
wanted
to
stop
and
protect
it
from
the
rain.
and
when
he
starts
to
put
the
top
down,
he
accidentally
saw
what
he
was
not
looking
for.but
accidentally
saw
the
dead
body
of
the
man
this
fellow
has
killed.
would
that
be
admissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
judge
them
--
what
they
all
say
is
that
--
he
wasn't
looking
for
this
but
he
just
actually
have
saw
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
they
hadn't
seized
the
property
but
he
just
wanted
to
testify
to
what
he
saw,
wholly
by
accident
but
not
looking
for
it,
not
searching
for
a
thing
in
the
world.
the
stronger
the
fact,
he
didn't
even
get
it.
but
he'd
been
barred
from
testifying
in
the
fact
that
he
saw
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
agreeing
now.
we
are
assuming
that
he
didn't
look
for
it,
he
didn't
search
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
no
effort
to
get
it,
didn't
want
it,
didn't
know
anything
about
the
agreement.
he
saw
it
when
he
shut
this
window
down.
do
you
think
that
he's
barred
from
testifying
to
what
he
saw?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
it
be?
they
are
two
different
things.
one
of
them
is
taking
property
that
you've
searched
for
and
seized
in
violation
of
the
law.
the
other
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he's
have
--
to
testifying
to
something
that
you
saw.
well,
you
are
not
violating
any
law
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
does
it
necessary
to
follow
the
two
and
distribute,
they're
locked
together.
if
it
was
not
a
search,
if
he
was
not
searching
for
it,
he's
not
looking
for
it,
he
just
accidentally
saw
it.
suppose
he'd
been
walking
along
the
street
and
saw
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
might
be
except
to
the
fourth
amendment
directed
that
the
effects
of
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
also
pointed
out,
didn't
it?
this
court
said,
case
after
case
after
case
after
case
that
the
reasonableness
is
always
dependent
on
all
of
the
circumstances
of
each
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
what
the
courts
been
holding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it
does
not
depend
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
all
part
of
the
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
before
you
do
that,
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
on
the
assumption
that
the
preston
case
held
those
circumstances
were
the
only
ones
under
which
--
which
would
make
a
search
reasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
--
to
the
preston
case.
are
you
reading
it
as
saying
while
these
circumstances
are
unreasonable
they
are
the
only
circumstance
that
could
ever
make
a
search
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
on
the
whole
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
is
still
reasonable,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
didn't
understand
it
to
say
did
you,
that
there's
a
per
se
rule,
per
se
just
that,
no
more,
no
less,
that
preston
had
decided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
all
searches
made
--
after
you'd
had
a
car,
certain
length,
the
time
were
unreasonable?
you
didn't
understand
that,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
written
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
thought
for
a
long
time
was
the
law
that
we
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case
to
see
if
it
is
unreasonable
search
and
it's
largely
a
question
of
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
relying
here
as
i
understand
it
on
the
fact
that
eight
judges,
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
was
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
your
answer
about
the
envelope
is
that
you're
not
saying
unless
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
that
an
envelope
could
never
be
opened
even
though
there
had
been
number
of
things
stolen,
they
were
looking
for
stolen
(inaudible),
you're
not
going
to
say
its
--
never
be
--
not
be
a
rule
that
should
never
opened
or
that
it
can
be
opened.
it
depends
on
all
the
circumstances
of
what's
going
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
hard
to
answer
a
per
se
question
particularly
about
anyone
of
particular
things.
