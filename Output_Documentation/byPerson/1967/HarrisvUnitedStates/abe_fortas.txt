justice
abe
fortas
but
as
i
--
would
you
agree
that
the
fourth
amendment
reason
for
excluding
evidence
is
in
part
at
least
to
discourage
an
unlawful
search?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
the
search
was
not
unlawful,
what
is
the
justification
for
excluding
the
evidence?
that
is
to
say
here
we
have
a
situation
in
which
neither
the
general
search,
the
entry
into
the
automobile
was
unlawful
nor
was
the
particular
action.
i
take
it,
your
submission
is
the
--
that
particular
action
of
opening
the
door
was
not
unlawful
and
then
in
plain
view
there
was
this
registration
card.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
up
to
that
point
whatever
the
police
man
did
was
not
unlawful
it
was
justified.
then
on
what
theory
should
the
evidence
be
excluded?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
there
was
--
you
agree
that
the
examine
--
what
the
policeman
did
with
respect
to
the
car
that
is
to
say
putting
the
tag
on
the
steering
wheel,
examining
it
to
remove
personal
property
which
might
get
lost
or
to
be
stolen,
opening
the
doors
with
the
purpose
of
running
up
--
and
want
to
protect
the
car
against
the
rain.
i
thought
you
agreed
that
all
of
that
was
lawful.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now
my
question
to
you
that
if
you
assume
that
all
of
that
was
lawful,
that
is
to
say,
the
entry
into
the
automobile,
the
opening
of
the
door
to
turn
up
the
windows,
then
on
--
how
do
you
--
how
can
we
get
from
there
to
the
proposition
that
the
fourth
amendment
will
not
permit
the
use
of
the
--
this
card
that
was
obtained
in
the
course
of
what
you
agree
was
an
unlawful
activity.
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
you
say
that
when
you
say
that
this
was
lawful
activity
where
the
car
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
the
fact
that
the
policeman
found
something
that
was
evidentiary.
so
it
relates
back
and
invalidates
what
you
would
otherwise
have
said,
it
was
a
lawful
entry
into
the
automobile,
is
that
your
position?
i
mean,
i
don't
--
it
seem
to
be
you're
saying
both
that
the
search
was
a
--
so-called
a
search,
the
entry
into
the
automobile
or
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
that
is
both
lawful
and
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
i
concede
for
example
that
if
in
this
automobile
there
were
--
they
locked
it
safe,
let's
say
or
a
very
secured
glove
compartment
that
it
might
very
well
be
arguable
that
if
the
police
went
in
the
back
you
see,
they
would
be
going
beyond
what
is
necessary
for
custodial
purposes.
that
is
i
understand
your
submission
here
you
agree
that
what
they
--
you
know,
make
you
any
such
point
you
agree
that
this
was
a
proper
activity
for
custodial
purposes.
and
then
the
card
came
into
view.
and
the
course
of
proper
custodial
activity,
there
was
limited
two
custodial
functions
and
that
they
didn't
go
beyond
it.
they
didn't
--
its
--
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
they
would
tear
open
a
package
that
they
found
in
the
area
and
find
evidence
in
that
package
or
go
into
a
locked
compartment
or
anything
of
that
sort.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
difference?
what
makes
the
difference
between
a
search
and
opening
a
door
of
a
car
and
seeing
what's
in
front
of
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
to
say
what
is
the
objective
factual
difference?
why
do
you
say
this
was
not
a
search
or
you
can
say
and
i
understand
your
point
that
--
to
be
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
--
that
fourth
amendment
was
not
violated
by
this
particular
search,
and
why
wasn't
it
a
search?
don't
you
have
a
search
every
time
you
open
the
door
and
see
what's
--
what
your
eyes
behold?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein
has
put
to
us
very
squarely
and
fairly
the
following
preposition
as
i
understand
it
that
where
in
the
course
of
an
administrative
search
for
proper
reasons,
a
custodial
search,
something
is
found
which
has
an
evidentiary
or
incriminating
effect
can
that
later
be
used,
that
crime
against
the
defendant.
now
that's
the
proposition
here.
and
so
--
and
that's
the
question
with
which
i
suggest
we
have
to
struggle
in
this
case
because
as
far
i'm
concern,
the
search
is
a
search.
then
you
have
a
next
question
as
to
whether
it
does
or
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
and
then
the
further
question
is
to
whether
something
transpires
or
something
is
done
by
the
police,
and
of
course
of
it
that
may
violate
that
may
result
in
exclusion
on
the
fourth
amendment
grounds.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
a
policeman
come
to
the
door
of
my
house
and
they
opened
the
door
in
my
house
and
they
walk
in
and
stop
right
there.
and
they
have
no
warrant,
no
cause,
no
--
nothing
else,
is
that
or
is
it
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
i
suggest
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it's
a
search
right
there
which
sets
in
motion
a
legal
inquiry.
and
that's
what's
happened
here
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
beytagh,
i
think
the
--
and
there's
another
possibility,
first,
i'd
tell
you,
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
the
custody,
police
custody
of
the
automobile
here
should
be
assimilated
to
the
impoundment
situation
in
cooper.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
mean
as
i
think
a
colloquy
a
moment
ago
indicated
that
anytime
the
police
impounded
an
automobile
whether
it
was
because
of
unlawful
parking
or
whatnot
that
--
you
would
say
that
cooper
ought
to
apply
even
though
cooper
was
a
different
kind
of
a
case,
it
was
a
forfeiture
type
of
case,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
anytime
the
police
lawfully
take
possession
of
an
automobile
whether
it's
for
parking
or
whatnot
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
--
that
cooper
ought
to
be
applied,
is
that
your
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
in
the
present
case
now,
what
--
am
i
right,
was
cooper
a
--
cooper
was
a
narcotics
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
case?
and
by
--
and
there
might
have
been
narcotics
concealed
in
the
car?
justice
abe
fortas
now
this
was
not
a
narcotics
case,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
--
what
was
this?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
don't
have
the
same
possibility
that
you're
suggesting
is
relevant
of
a
--
use
of
the
car
as
a
place
of
concealment,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
for
the
fruits
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
was
(inaudible)
of
time
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
between
the
commission
of
the
robbery
and
the
time
that
the
police
grabbed
the
car?
justice
abe
fortas
by
now
this
--
alright,
i
think
i
understand
your
position
on
that
but
there's
still
another
approach
here,
isn't
there?
which
is
that,
assuming
that
the
police
had
custody
of
the
car
lawfully
as
mr.
weinstein
seems
to
concede,
the
--
what
they
did,
their
search
of
the
car,
their
entry
into
the
car
was
lawful
in
the
exercise
of
their
custodial
responsibilities,
is
that
a
separate
and
distinct
approach
to
the
analysis
of
the
problem
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
assume
though
that
cooper
placed
special
emphasis
upon
the
forfeiture
aspect,
the
second
analysis
that
i
have
suggested
here
would
get
away
from
what
maybe
the
difficulty
of
analogizing
this
situation
to
a
forfeiture
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
i
understand
you.
do
you
mean
that
if
the
police
lawfully
enter
a
house
let's
say
with
permission
and
they
see
a
sealed
envelope
lying
on
the
table
or
a
package
in
brown
paper
with
a
plan
around
it.
that
they
may
then
proceed
to
open
the
envelop
or
to
open
the
package
without
more?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
a
--
they
entered
a
house
in
pursuit
of
some
robbers
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
i
--
would
you
agree
that
the
fourth
amendment
reason
for
excluding
evidence
is
in
part
at
least
to
discourage
an
unlawful
search?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
the
search
was
not

what
is
the
justification

evidence?
that

we
have

well,
there
was
(inaudible)
of
time
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
between
the
commission
of
the
robbery
and
the
time
that
the
police
grabbed
the
car?
justice
abe
fortas
by
now
this
--
alright,
i
think
i
understand
your
position
on
that
but
there's
still
another
approach
here,
isn't
there?
which
is
that,
assuming
that
the
police
had
custody
of
the
car
lawfully
as
mr.
weinstein
seems
to
concede,
the
--
what
they
did,
their
search
of
the
car,
their
entry
into
the
car
was
lawful
in
the
exercise
of
their
custodial
responsibilities,
is
that
a
separate
and
distinct
approach
to
the
analysis
of
the
problem
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
assume
though
that
cooper
placed
special
emphasis
upon
the
forfeiture
aspect,
the
second
analysis
that
i
have
suggested
here
would
get
away
from
what
maybe
the
difficulty
of
analogizing
this
situation
to
a
forfeiture
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
i
understand
you.
do
you
mean
that
if
the
police
lawfully
enter
a
house
let's
say
with
permission
and
they
see
a
sealed
envelope
lying
on
the
table
or
a
package
in
brown
paper
with
a
plan
around
it.
that
they
may
then
proceed
to
open
the
envelop
or
to
open
the
package
without
more?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
a
--
they
entered
a
house
in
pursuit
of
some
robbers
