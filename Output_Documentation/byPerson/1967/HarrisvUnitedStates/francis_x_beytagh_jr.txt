mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
before
we
get
to
any
fourth
amendment
questions
in
this
case,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
figure
out
whether
are
any
are
presented.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here
and
as
found
by
both
of
the
courts
below,
the
evidence
that
was
sought
to
be
suppressed
was
not
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
search
at
all.
we
have
in
this
case
concurrent
findings
of
fact
by
two
lower
courts
in
this
regard.
we
have
10
judges
that
have
looked
at
this
question.
eight
of
them
have
concluded
that
this
card
was
found
incident
not
to
a
search
but
incident
to
the
officer
seeking
to
roll
up
the
windows
to
prevent
the
car
from
being
damage
by
the
rain.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
take
it
if
there
is
no
search,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
gets
to
the
matter
of
a
terminology.
this
court
had
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
what
has
come
to
be
called
an
open
viewer,
full
view
doctrine.
the
district
judge
here
found
that
the
situation
was
quite
analogous
to
that
but
for
the
fact
that
the
door
had
to
be
opened
before
this
car
was
in
full
view.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
to
say
a
search
is
a
search
requires
one
to
reject
the
findings
that
were
made
by
both
the
courts
below.
that
maybe
right.
and
a
proper
way
to
proceed
what
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
question
is
much
like
the
one
posed
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
all
that
had
going
on
here
was
that
the
officer
went
out
to
close
the
window
and
there
had
been
no
other
--
then
no
regulation
relating
to
an
inventory
search,
no
other
circumstances
that
showed
some
kind
of
searching
activity
was
engaged
in.
then
would
that
be
a
search,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
be
but
i
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
like
to
know
why
they
opened
the
door.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
your
house
is
on
the
fire
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we'll
assume
that
with
the
petitioner,
there
was
a
search
here.
and
it
seems
to
us
then
the
question
its
posed
is
whether
--
assuming
that
there
was
a
search
and
rejecting
the
findings
below
that
there
wasn't.
the
search
was
reasonable.
now,
as
i
take
a
petitioner
concedes
that
the
--
it's
a
reasonable
thing
for
the
police
to
conduct
searches
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
property
which
is
found
in
impounded
cars.
and
he
says
that
here
the
impounding
was
proper.
what
he
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i
don't
know
of
any
situations
here
before
where
that
dichotomy
has
been
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
he's
saying
essentially
is
that
while
it
was
proper
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity,
what
was
improper
was
to
use
anything
that
was
found
as
a
result
of
it
and
as
--
and
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
white
this
courts
decision
under
the
fourth
amendment
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
activity.
and
that
it
seems
incongruous
to
say
that
the
activity
would
be
lawful
but
for
the
fact
that
you
found
something
incident
to
it
that
might
be
used
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
know
how
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
abused
by
opening
the
door
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
of
what
the
government
is
doing
is
reasonable
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
it,
it
finds
something
that's
usable
doesn't
lead
you
to
the
result
that
it
can't
be
used.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
hope
that
at
least
it
could
be
seized
and
removed.
i
would
think
it
would
be.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
situation
here
is
essentially
the
same
thing
though
your
facts
are
a
little
bit
heightened
in
impact.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
essentially
i
think
what
happened.
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
in
our
view
and
the
so-called
open
view
cases
is
that
in
order
to
--
as
everyone
knows
to
roll
up
windows
on
a
car,
you
have
to
open
the
door
because
they
are
rolled
up
from
the
inside.
and
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
suppose,
your
honor
that
if
the
card
could
not
be
introduced,
he
could
not
testify.
as
to
that
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
be
much
purpose
in
saying
that
the
card
couldn't
be
introduced
but
you
could
still
testify
about
what
he
saw
and
observed
pursuant
to
the
activity
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
would
hope
that
it
wouldn't
bar
him
from
testifying.
but
my
answers
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
he
can
testify
or
not
is
essentially
the
same
question
as
to
whether
the
card
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
agree.
i
stay
on
the
facts
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
card
should
be
introduced
and
he
could
testify
as
to
what
he
saw.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
perhaps
they're
not
but
it
would
be
--
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
kind
of
a
curious
rule
if
you
had
the
thing
that
he
saw
and
you
couldn't
introduce
that
but
he
could
testify
as
to
what
it
was.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
then
if
pursuant
to
this
search?
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
a
somewhat
different
situation
but
i
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
in
the
context
to
none
of
this
court's
decisions
talking
about
automobile
searches
and
seizures,
the
cooper
case
which
is
the
last
authority
on
the
point,
speaks
in
terms
of
the
relationship
of
the
search
to
the
crime
for
which
the
person
was
suspected
here.
the
only
thing
that
the
individual
is
suspected
of
is
leaving
his
car
in
the
wrong
place.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
reasonable,
yes.
all
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
or
is
unreasonable.
all
that
i
really
mean
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
question
need
not
be
reached
here
because
on
the
facts,
we
do
have
a
situation
where
a
crime
have
been
committed,
the
car
was
intimately
related
to
that,
it
was
identified
as
the
getaway
car
and
provided
the
basis
for
the
probable
cause
to
arrest,
whatever.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
know
what
preston
stands
for
anymore.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
anymore.
in
light
of
cooper,
i
think
that
the
efforts
have
been
made
by
courts
subsequent
to
cooper
to
put
them
together.
some
courts
have
said
that
cooper
overruled
preston.
cooper
of
course
pointed
out
that
there
were
distinguishing
features
between
the
two
cases.
here
it
seems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
cooper
said.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
a
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
a
fact
your
honor
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
speak
in
those
terms
but
it
also
--
i
have
to
concede
as
a
fact
that
there
are
other
cases
that
speak
in
somewhat
different
terms,
speak
in
terms
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
they
don't
say
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
reasonableness
but
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
opportunity
or
ability
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
there
are
these
two
lines
of
authority
that
move
along
sometimes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
that's
one
way
to
look
at
them.
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
situation
here
is
distinguishable
from
preston.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper
there
was
no
connection
in
the
preston
situation
between
the
crime
for
which
the
people
were
arrested
and
in
the
automobile.
whereas
in
cooper,
the
automobile
was
--
it
was
conceded
as
it
is
here
was
lawfully
impounded
because
it
had
been
used
to
transport
the
narcotics
there.
and
here,
it
was
the
getaway
car
from
the
robbery.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which
authorized
the
forfeiture
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
upon
conviction,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
element
was
in
the
cooper
case
but
the
cooper
opinion
itself
said
that
the
forfeiture
cannot
resolve
until
a
conviction
have
been
obtained.
and
the
dissenting
opinion
there
pointed
out
that
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
the
fact
that
a
forfeiture
may
result
in
the
future
to
justify
a
different
kind
of
activity
and
approaches
to
the
car
during
the
time
it
was
held.
when
it
was
held,
it's
still
was
the
car
of
the
owner
until
the
forfeiture
had
occurred.
the
forfeiture
couldn't
occur
until
the
individual
have
been
found
guilty.
we
think
that
on
the
facts
here
the
situation
is
a
much
closer
one
than
a
--
to
cooper
than
it
is
to
preston.
in
cooper,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
reason
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
the
cooper
case?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
preston
should
be
read
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
in
preston
as
you
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
major
effort
was
to
justify
the
search
on
the
ground
it
was
incidental
to
an
arrest.
preston
says
that
a
search
that
is
not
contemporaneous
and
is
not
in
the
same
area
is
not
--
simply
not
incident
to
the
arrest
and
therefore
can't
be
justified
on
that
ground.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
and
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying,
we
view
the
situation
presented
here
assuming
again
we've
reached
the
question
of
a
search
and
a
reasonableness
of
a
search
under
the
facts
as
one
that
it
is
closer
to
cooper
than
to
preston.
here
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
reason
for
in
the
nature
of
police
custody
of
an
automobile
may
constitutionally
justify
a
search
as
a
reasonable
one.
and
also
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
crime
for
which
the
individual
is
arrested
is
relevant.
and
in
cooper
the
search
was
one
that
was
closely
related
to
the
reason
for
the
arrest,
the
reason
the
car
was
impounded
etcetera.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
there
was
that
element
in
cooper,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that.
as
i
was
pointing
out
the
language
in
cooper,
that
talks
in
terms
of
why
the
search
there
was
reasonable,
talks
about
the
relationship
between
the
reason
for
the
impounding
and
the
search
which
ensued.
it
seems
to
us
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
was
a
robbery
in
which
the
--
this
vehicle
had
been
identified
as
the
getaway
car
and
had
been
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
don't
have,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
--
the
first
place
that
the
fruits
of
a
robbery
go
when
a
car
is
used
to
get
away
from
the
scene
is
into
the
car.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
the
robbery
was
at
midnight
and
the
police
seized
the
car
the
next
day
at
1:30.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
separate
and
distinct.
i
think
that
it
--
that
again
is
a
factor
as
mr.
justice
black
was
pointing
out
that
relates
to
the
overall
reasonableness.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right,
i
agree
with
you.
several
things
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
here,
the
regulation
does
draw
a
distinction
between
the
entry
of
locked
areas
of
automobiles.
and
says
that
when
a
glove
compartment
or
a
trunk
is
locked
and
it
appears
that
the
car
won't
be
held
for
a
significant
period
of
time,
there's
no
need
to
enter
those
parts.
it
also
says
that
where
they
are
locked
and
there
is
a
need
to
enter
them
they
should
not
be
broken
but
the
officer
should
go
to
the
property
clerk
and
seek
instructions.
i
take
it
that
the
basic
purpose
of
this
is
to
avoid
insofar
as
possible
unnecessary
disruption
of
individual's
automobile.
finally,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
--
our
views
on
automobile
search
is
generally.
we're
--
of
course,
the
country
that
has
made
the
automobile,
the
thing
that
everybody
has.
we
have
millions
of
them
on
our
highways.
and
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
large
numbers
of
them
are
impounded.
indeed
i
should
point
out
that
in
1966
over
14,000
cars
were
impounded
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
rush
hour
obstruction
situations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
most
of
those
are
returned
as
soon
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
individual
finds
out
where
they
are
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
get
them.
there
is
a
significant
problem
not
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
in
all
urban
areas
with
automobiles.
and
there
are
problems
with
safeguarding
that
the
property
that
exists
there.
furthermore,
we
don't
think
that
it's
an
unnecessary
thing
to
analogize
automobiles
to
homes
or
houses
in
all
respects
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
fourth
amendment.
even
in
the
preston
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
never
been
applied
and
precisely
the
same
way
as
to
automobiles
as
it
has
to
homes.
if
the
basic
thrust
of
it
was
to
maintain
privacy
in
the
house,
every
man's
castle
that
sort
of
approach.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
considerations
are
irrelevant
in
assessing
the
overall
reasonableness
of
a
search
of
an
automobile.
an
automobile
is
an
effect.
and
the
fourth
amendment
talks
in
terms
of
effects.
and
it's
also
a
container.
now,
the
government
below
argued
what
the
--
has
been
termed
instrumentality
theory
that
once
you
can
seize
the
instruments,
you
can
seize
and
search
all
of
the
contents.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
the
abstract
here
because
we
do
have
this
inventory
search
procedure
that's
more
related
to
the
particular
facts
here.
but
i
should
point
out
that
a
lot
of
effects
or
containers
as
well;
briefcases
are,
suitcases
are,
handbags
are,
wallets
are.
now,
as
to
most
of
these
items,
it
has
never
been
thought
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
envelopes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
i
don't
think
it's
been
thought
that
because
such
items
are
--
have
a
capacity
of
containing
things
that
when
you
take
them
lawfully
into
custody
or
seize
them
or
whatever,
the
term
might
be
in
the
circumstances
that
you
can't
thereupon
do
with
them
what
is
proper
and
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
cars
are
different,
they're
bigger.
we
understand
that
and
we
appreciate
that.
we
also
point
out
that
cars
are
not
homes
and
that
the
basic
thrust
and
or
the
office
is
and
the
basic
thrust
of
most
to
the
court's
fourth
amendment
decisions
have
related
to
the
protection
of
the
privacy
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
why
they
entered
the
house
and
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
--
part
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
apply
the
test
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
seizure
and
if
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i'd
--
again
i
say
that
a
court
would
i
think
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
situation.
if
somebody
had
stolen
a
wrapped
package
and
you
come
upon
them
properly
and
there's
a
wrapped
package
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
no
your
honor
because
it
would
be
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
very
--
and
i
think
that
makes
it
difficult
to
answer
somewhat
in
the
abstract
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
before
we
get
to
any
fourth
amendment
questions
in
this
case,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
figure
out
whether
are
any
are
presented.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here
and
as
found
by
both
of
the
courts
below,
the
evidence
that
was
sought
to
be
suppressed
was
not
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
search
at
all.
we
have
in
this
case
concurrent
findings
of
fact
by
two
lower
courts
in
this
regard.
we
have
10
judges
that
have
looked
at
this
question.
eight
of
them
have
concluded
that
this
card
was
found
incident
not
to
a
search
but
incident
to
the
officer
seeking
to
roll
up
the
windows
to
prevent
the
car
from
being
damage
by
the
rain.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
take
it
if
there
is
no
search,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
gets
to
the
matter
of
a
terminology.
this
court
had
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
what
has
come
to
be
called
an
open
viewer,
full
view
doctrine.
the
district
judge
here
found
that
the
situation
was
quite
analogous
to
that
but
for
the
fact
that
the
door
had
to
be
opened
before
this
car
was
in
full
view.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
to
say
a
search
is
a
search
requires
one
to
reject
the
findings
that
were
made
by
both
the
courts
below.
that
maybe
right.
and
a
proper
way
to
proceed
what
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
question
is
much
like
the
one
posed
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
all
that
had
going
on
here
was
that
the
officer
went
out
to
close
the
window
and
there
had
been
no
other
--
then
no
regulation
relating
to
an
inventory
search,
no
other
circumstances
that
showed
some
kind
of
searching
activity
was
engaged
in.
then
would
that
be
a
search,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
be
but
i
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
like
to
know
why
they
opened
the
door.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
your
house
is
on
the
fire
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we'll
assume
that
with
the
petitioner,
there
was
a
search
here.
and
it
seems
to
us
then
the
question
its
posed
is
whether
--
assuming
that
there
was
a
search
and
rejecting
the
findings
below
that
there
wasn't.
the
search
was
reasonable.
now,
as
i
take
a
petitioner
concedes
that
the
--
it's
a
reasonable
thing
for
the
police
to
conduct
searches
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
property
which
is
found
in
impounded
cars.
and
he
says
that
here
the
impounding
was
proper.
what
he
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i
don't
know
of
any
situations
here
before
where
that
dichotomy
has
been
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
he's
saying
essentially
is
that
while
it
was
proper
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity,
what
was
improper
was
to
use
anything
that
was
found
as
a
result
of
it
and
as
--
and
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
white
this
courts
decision
under
the
fourth
amendment
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
activity.
and
that
it
seems
incongruous
to
say
that
the
activity
would
be
lawful
but
for
the
fact
that
you
found
something
incident
to
it
that
might
be
used
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
know
how
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
abused
by
opening
the
door
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
of
what
the
government
is
doing
is
reasonable
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
it,
it
finds
something
that's
usable
doesn't
lead
you
to
the
result
that
it
can't
be
used.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
hope
that
at
least
it
could
be
seized
and
removed.
i
would
think
it
would
be.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
situation
here
is
essentially
the
same
thing
though
your
facts
are
a
little
bit
heightened
in
impact.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
essentially
i
think
what
happened.
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
in
our
view
and
the
so-called
open
view
cases
is
that
in
order
to
--
as
everyone
knows
to
roll
up
windows
on
a
car,
you
have
to
open
the
door
because
they
are
rolled
up
from
the
inside.
and
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
suppose,
your
honor
that
if
the
card
could
not
be
introduced,
he
could
not
testify.
as
to
that
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
be
much
purpose
in
saying
that
the
card
couldn't
be
introduced
but
you
could
still
testify
about
what
he
saw
and
observed
pursuant
to
the
activity
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
would
hope
that
it
wouldn't
bar
him
from
testifying.
but
my
answers
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
he
can
testify
or
not
is
essentially
the
same
question
as
to
whether
the
card
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
agree.
i
stay
on
the
facts
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
card
should
be
introduced
and
he
could
testify
as
to
what
he
saw.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
perhaps
they're
not
but
it
would
be
--
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
kind
of
a
curious
rule
if
you
had
the
thing
that
he
saw
and
you
couldn't
introduce
that
but
he
could
testify
as
to
what
it
was.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
then
if
pursuant
to
this
search?
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
a
somewhat
different
situation
but
i
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
in
the
context
to
none
of
this
court's
decisions
talking
about
automobile
searches
and
seizures,
the
cooper
case
which
is
the
last
authority
on
the
point,
speaks
in
terms
of
the
relationship
of
the
search
to
the
crime
for
which
the
person
was
suspected
here.
the
only
thing
that
the
individual
is
suspected
of
is
leaving
his
car
in
the
wrong
place.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
reasonable,
yes.
all
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
or
is
unreasonable.
all
that
i
really
mean
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
question
need
not
be
reached
here
because
on
the
facts,
we
do
have
a
situation
where
a
crime
have
been
committed,
the
car
was
intimately
related
to
that,
it
was
identified
as
the
getaway
car
and
provided
the
basis
for
the
probable
cause
to
arrest,
whatever.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
know
what
preston
stands
for
anymore.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
anymore.
in
light
of
cooper,
i
think
that
the
efforts
have
been
made
by
courts
subsequent
to
cooper
to
put
them
together.
some
courts
have
said
that
cooper
overruled
preston.
cooper
of
course
pointed
out
that
there
were
distinguishing
features
between
the
two
cases.
here
it
seems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
cooper
said.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
a
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
a
fact
your
honor
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
speak
in
those
terms
but
it
also
--
i
have
to
concede
as
a
fact
that
there
are
other
cases
that
speak
in
somewhat
different
terms,
speak
in
terms
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
they
don't
say
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
reasonableness
but
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
opportunity
or
ability
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
there
are
these
two
lines
of
authority
that
move
along
sometimes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
that's
one
way
to
look
at
them.
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
situation
here
is
distinguishable
from
preston.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper
there
was
no
connection
in
the
preston
situation
between
the
crime
for
which
the
people
were
arrested
and
in
the
automobile.
whereas
in
cooper,
the
automobile
was
--
it
was
conceded
as
it
is
here
was
lawfully
impounded
because
it
had
been
used
to
transport
the
narcotics
there.
and
here,
it
was
the
getaway
car
from
the
robbery.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which
authorized
the
forfeiture
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
upon
conviction,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
element
was
in
the
cooper
case
but
the
cooper
opinion
itself
said
that
the
forfeiture
cannot
resolve
until
a
conviction
have
been
obtained.
and
the
dissenting
opinion
there
pointed
out
that
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
the
fact
that
a
forfeiture
may
result
in
the
future
to
justify
a
different
kind
of
activity
and
approaches
to
the
car
during
the
time
it
was
held.
when
it
was
held,
it's
still
was
the
car
of
the
owner
until
the
forfeiture
had
occurred.
the
forfeiture
couldn't
occur
until
the
individual
have
been
found
guilty.
we
think
that
on
the
facts
here
the
situation
is
a
much
closer
one
than
a
--
to
cooper
than
it
is
to
preston.
in
cooper,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
reason
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
the
cooper
case?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
preston
should
be
read
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
in
preston
as
you
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
major
effort
was
to
justify
the
search
on
the
ground
it
was
incidental
to
an
arrest.
preston
says
that
a
search
that
is
not
contemporaneous
and
is
not
in
the
same
area
is
not
--
simply
not
incident
to
the
arrest
and
therefore
can't
be
justified
on
that
ground.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
and
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying,
we
view
the
situation
presented
here
assuming
again
we've
reached
the
question
of
a
search
and
a
reasonableness
of
a
search
under
the
facts
as
one
that
it
is
closer
to
cooper
than
to
preston.
here
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
reason
for
in
the
nature
of
police
custody
of
an
automobile
may
constitutionally
justify
a
search
as
a
reasonable
one.
and
also
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
cooper,
the
crime
for
which
the
individual
is
arrested
is
relevant.
and
in
cooper
the
search
was
one
that
was
closely
related
to
the
reason
for
the
arrest,
the
reason
the
car
was
impounded
etcetera.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
there
was
that
element
in
cooper,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that.
as
i
was
pointing
out
the
language
in
cooper,
that
talks
in
terms
of
why
the
search
there
was
reasonable,
talks
about
the
relationship
between
the
reason
for
the
impounding
and
the
search
which
ensued.
it
seems
to
us
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
was
a
robbery
in
which
the
--
this
vehicle
had
been
identified
as
the
getaway
car
and
had
been
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
don't
have,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
--
the
first
place
that
the
fruits
of
a
robbery
go
when
a
car
is
used
to
get
away
from
the
scene
is
into
the
car.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
the
robbery
was
at
midnight
and
the
police
seized
the
car
the
next
day
at
1:30.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
separate
and
distinct.
i
think
that
it
--
that
again
is
a
factor
as
mr.
justice
black
was
pointing
out
that
relates
to
the
overall
reasonableness.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right,
i
agree
with
you.
several
things
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
here,
the
regulation
does
draw
a
distinction
between
the
entry
of
locked
areas
of
automobiles.
and
says
that
when
a
glove
compartment
or
a
trunk
is
locked
and
it
appears
that
the
car
won't
be
held
for
a
significant
period
of
time,
there's
no
need
to
enter
those
parts.
it
also
says
that
where
they
are
locked
and
there
is
a
need
to
enter
them
they
should
not
be
broken
but
the
officer
should
go
to
the
property
clerk
and
seek
instructions.
i
take
it
that
the
basic
purpose
of
this
is
to
avoid
insofar
as
possible
unnecessary
disruption
of
individual's
automobile.
finally,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
--
our
views
on
automobile
search
is
generally.
we're
--
of
course,
the
country
that
has
made
the
automobile,
the
thing
that
everybody
has.
we
have
millions
of
them
on
our
highways.
and
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
large
numbers
of
them
are
impounded.
indeed
i
should
point
out
that
in
1966
over
14,000
cars
were
impounded
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
rush
hour
obstruction
situations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
most
of
those
are
returned
as
soon
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
individual
finds
out
where
they
are
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
get
them.
there
is
a
significant
problem
not
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
in
all
urban
areas
with
automobiles.
and
there
are
problems
with
safeguarding
that
the
property
that
exists
there.
furthermore,
we
don't
think
that
it's
an
unnecessary
thing
to
analogize
automobiles
to
homes
or
houses
in
all
respects
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
fourth
amendment.
even
in
the
preston
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
never
been
applied
and
precisely
the
same
way
as
to
automobiles
as
it
has
to
homes.
if
the
basic
thrust
of
it
was
to
maintain
privacy
in
the
house,
every
man's
castle
that
sort
of
approach.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
considerations
are
irrelevant
in
assessing
the
overall
reasonableness
of
a
search
of
an
automobile.
an
automobile
is
an
effect.
and
the
fourth
amendment
talks
in
terms
of
effects.
and
it's
also
a
container.
now,
the
government
below
argued
what
the
--
has
been
termed
instrumentality
theory
that
once
you
can
seize
the
instruments,
you
can
seize
and
search
all
of
the
contents.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
the
abstract
here
because
we
do
have
this
inventory
search
procedure
that's
more
related
to
the
particular
facts
here.
but
i
should
point
out
that
a
lot
of
effects
or
containers
as
well;
briefcases
are,
suitcases
are,
handbags
are,
wallets
are.
now,
as
to
most
of
these
items,
it
has
never
been
thought
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
envelopes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
i
don't
think
it's
been
thought
that
because
such
items
are
--
have
a
capacity
of
containing
things
that
when
you
take
them
lawfully
into
custody
or
seize
them
or
whatever,
the
term
might
be
in
the
circumstances
that
you
can't
thereupon
do
with
them
what
is
proper
and
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
cars
are
different,
they're
bigger.
we
understand
that
and
we
appreciate
that.
we
also
point
out
that
cars
are
not
homes
and
that
the
basic
thrust
and
or
the
office
is
and
the
basic
thrust
of
most
to
the
court's
fourth
amendment
decisions
have
related
to
the
protection
of
the
privacy
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
why
they
entered
the
house
and
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
--
part
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
apply
the
test
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
seizure
and
if
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i'd
--
again
i
say
that
a
court
would
i
think
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
situation.
if
somebody
had
stolen
a
wrapped
package
and
you
come
upon
them
properly
and
there's
a
wrapped
package
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
no
your
honor
because
it
would
be
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
very
--
and
i
think
that
makes
it
difficult
to
answer
somewhat
in
the
abstract
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
