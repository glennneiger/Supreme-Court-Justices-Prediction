in
this
case
is
cited
on
page

of
my
brief.
during
the
late
evening
hours
of
august
29th,
1964
at
approximately
11:45
pm
that
evening,
a
york
robbery
occurred
in
the
5500
block
of
13th
street,
northwest
washington
dc.
among
one
of
the
articles
taken
from
the
victim
that
evening
was
a
registration
card
to
his
automobile
bearing
his
name
and
identification
of
that
automobile.
an
off-duty
police
officer
at
approximately
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
observed
three
colored
males
running
north
on
13th
street
and
enter
a
ford
automobile.
the
officer
wrote
down
a
description
of
the
automobile
and
the
tag
number.
he
phoned
this
description
in
to
the
sixth
precinct
approximately
five
to
10
minutes
after
he
observed
the
three
males
running
north
on
13th
street.
the
next
day
another
police
officer
was
assigned
to
investigate
this
robbery.
and
at
that
time
was
given
a
description
of
the
automobile
and
the
tag
number.
the
police
officer
at
that
time
checked
with
the
motor
vehicle
department
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
ascertain
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
owner
of
that
automobile
and
also
that
the
car
was
registered
to
a
premises
in
the
vicinity
of
the
2500
block
of
m
street,
northwest.
the
police
officer
preceded
to
the
area
the
2500
block
of
m
street
northwest,
at
which
time,
he
saw
the
petitioner
in
this
case
attempt
to
enter
his
automobile.
the
officer
testified
that
the
petitioner
had
opened
the
door
to
his
car
when
he
approached
him,
asked
him
his
name,
placed
him
under
arrest
for
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
a
police
cruiser
at
that
point.
the
arresting
officer
conducted
a
cursory
search
of
the
automobile
to
see
whether
or
not
there
were
any
weapons
in
the
automobile.
he
found
none.
he
then
called
for
a
police
crane
to
come
and
tow
the
vehicle
to
the
sixth
precinct.
the
car
was
left
on
the
m
street
--at
1m
street
unlocked
and
unattended
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
police
crane.
the
arresting
officer
and
his
partner
transported
the
petitioner
via
a
police
cruiser
to
the
sixth
precinct
which
was
a
ride
of
10
to
20
minutes
and
was
approximately
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
place
of
arrest.
the
time
of
arrest
without
any
warrant
was
estimated
to
be
at
1:30
pm
in
the
afternoon.
at
approximately
3:00
pm
the
same
day,
the
operator
of
the
crane
arrived
at
the
sixth
precinct
and
informed
the
arresting
officer
that
the
car
was
on
the
lot
inside
of
the
precinct.
he
notified
the
officer
that
there
was
a
light
rain
falling,
and
that
he
did
not
roll
up
the
windows
because
he
did
not
want
to
disturb
any
finger
prints
which
may
have
been
found
on
the
automobile.
officer
baker
who
was
the
arresting
officer
went
out
to
the
automobile
to
make
an
inventory
search
pursuant
to
the
police
regulation
which
is
cited
again
on
page
3
of
my
brief.
officer
baker
first
went
and
put
a
property
tag
on
the
steering
wheel.
he
then
proceeded
into
the
car.
he
searched
the
glove
compartment,
the
rear
of
the
car
and
he
also
testified
that
he
looked
behind
the
sun
visor.
he
found
nothing
to
remove
from
the
car.
he
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
around
to
the
passenger
side.
he
opened
up
the
right
front
door
to
roll
up
the
window
to
protect
it
from
the
rain.
at
this
point,
lying
on
the
door
well
with
the
automobile
was
a
registration
card
belonging
to
the
victim
of
the
robbery
that
occurred
the
night
before.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
it
was.
it
was
the
right
door
well
on
the
right
front
door.
after
the
officer
discovered
the
registration
card,
he
left
the
door
opened.
he
left
the
registration
card
lying
in
the
well.
he
went
into
the
precinct
and
brought
the
petitioner
back
and
confronted
him
with
the
evidence
which
he
found.
he
then
took
the
evidence,
turned
it
over
to
the
police
property
clerk.
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
the
court
and
obtained
a
search
warrant
directed
to
the
police
property
clerk
to
seize
the
registration
card
which
he
had
found
the
day
before.
officer
baker
testified
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
find
and
protect
property
which
may
have
been
in
the
car
pursuant
to
the
police
regulation
which
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
on
a
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence,
it
was
denied.
however
the
district
court
found
that
the
police
officer
had
more
than
one
thing
in
mind
when
he
went
out
to
look
at
this
car.
at
page
118
of
the
record,
the
district
judge
stated
that
not
only
did
he
go
out
to
protect
the
automobile
from
the
elements
or
to
remove
property,
but
in
fact
he
did
conduct
a
search
of
that
automobile
for
that
he
eventually
opened
up
the
trunk
of
the
car
which
was
locked.
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
has
laid
down
procedures
to
be
followed
where
police
officers
want
to
search
areas
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
most
recently,
this
doctrine
was
reaffirmed
in
katz
versus
the
united
states
in
which
the
court
said
that
searches
conducted
outside
the
judicial
process
without
prior
approval
by
judge
of
magistrate
are
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
only
to
a
few
specifically
established
and
well
delineated
exceptions.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
police
have
administrative
problem.
i
would
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
restrict
the
use
of
any
incriminating
evidence
which
they
may
find
pursuant
to
an
administrative
search.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
i
would
ask
though
that
any
incriminating
evidence
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct,
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
perfectly
proper.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
they
ought
to
do
this
but
they
should
not.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct
unless
they
comply
with
the
exceptions
or
unless
the
case
falls
within
the
exceptions
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
in
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
first,
it
doesn't
fall
with
any
of
the
--
within
any
of
the
exceptions
as
announced
by
this
court
previously.
that
is
the
two
exceptions
announced
in
preston
nor
the
forfeiture
statute
that
was
a
--
in
proof.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
this
way.
the
intent
of
the
police
department
in
protecting
the
property
is
not
determinative
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amend
--
or
a
persons
fourth
amendment's
rights.
the
motive
or
intent
maybe
perfectly
alright
but
they're
encroaching
on
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
go
into
the
petitioner's
automobile
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
am
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
there
is
no
indication
that
he
was
ever
asked
whether
or
not
the
officer
could
inventory
the
car.
there
was
no
consent
given
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no
it's
not.
i
--
they
had
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
impound
the
car.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
on
the
theory
that
if
they
had
let
--
they
could
have
left
the
car
on
the
street
if
they
have
locked
it
up.
they
did
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
car
may
have
been
connected
with
a
robbery
that
occurred
the
night
before
and
if
they
had
a
description
and
the
tag
known.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
car
was
used
in
a
robbery.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
believe
he
was.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes
he
was.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
connection
there
was
his
car
to
him.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
now
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
your,
honor
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
car
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
following
preston.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
once
he
makes
a
physical
intrusion
into
this
car
regardless
of
his
motive
and
seizes
incriminating
evidence,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
did
admit
that
that
conduct
was
lawful
because
of
the
administrative
problem
that
the
police
have.
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
protect
themselves
against
a
lawsuit
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
--
for
stole
--
for
articles
being
stolen
or
for
negligence.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
i'll
get
to
it
this
way.
the
search
being
conducted
by
the
metropolitan
police
department
is
one
in
administrative
search
which
was
struck
down
by
camera
and
see.
second,
it
gets
around
the
particularity
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
it
strikes
it
down
in
this
respect
that
he
can't
use
the
administrative
search
without
a
warrant
to
secure
evidence.
and
this
is
what
we're
getting
at.
the
administrative
search
here
was
not
designed
only
to
protect
the
--
it
wasn't
limited
only
to
the
protection
of
the
valuables
or
the
petitioner's
automobile,
but
it
also
allowed
then
to
seize
any
evidence
which
they
may
have
found
in
the
automobile
--
in
the
car.
you
have
a
general
and
exploratory
search
without
particularly
describing
the
things
to
be
seized
in
the
vehicle
at
the
time
that
they
seized
it.
so,
it
violates
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
seized
the
incriminating
evidence
pursuant
to
this
general
search.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
i
am
saying
that
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
it
was
lawful
on
one
side
and
unlawful
for
the
reason
that
he
seized
the
evidence.
that
is
--
there
is
the
--
the
problem
here
is
that
they
have
to
inventory
these
cars
and
yet
i'm
asking
this
court
that
were
there
searching
or
inventorying
a
car
pursuant
to
that
police
regulation
and
they
find
incriminating
evidence,
they
should
be
restricted.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
this
incriminating
evidence
although
they
should
be
allowed
to
remove
the
valuables
from
the
car.
applying
the
exceptions
in
preston
versus
united
states
that
is
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
contemporaneous
thereto,
the
facts
in
this
case
certainly
don't
justify
a
search
of
this
vehicle
an
hour
and
a
half
later
and
at
the
police
station,
five
or
six
miles
away.
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
that
police
officer
conducted
the
inventory
search
at
the
police
precinct.
and
the
third
exception
is
announced
in
cooper
versus
california
where
in
the
state
legislature
had
passed
the
statute
forfeiting
the
automobile
to
the
state
in
certain
types
of
crimes.
there
is
no
such
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia,
therefore
the
search
pursuant
to
--
that
statute
would
not
be
lawful
in
this
instance.
the
administrative
search
in
my
opinion
is
also
violated
from
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
was
a
part
of
a
general
practice
of
making
general
searches
of
all
automobiles
that
came
into
police
custody.
if
this
general
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
administrative
search
mr.
justice
black
is
a
regulation
promulgated
here
by
the
metropolitan
police
department.
they
were
or
able
to
promulgate
regulations
directing
the
police
officers
without
either
legislative
authority
or
judicial
authority
to
do
certain
things
which
they
may
not
otherwise
have
been
able
to
do.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
say
it
was
valid
for
the
--
for
defensive
purposes
to
protect
the
police
department
against
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
my
--
basically
my
case.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i'm
not
asking
to
overrule
abbot.
as
i
recollect,
there
was
a
lawful
--
there
was
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
in
abbot.
this
a
search
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
it
took
place
sometime
later.
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
overrule
abbot
your
honor.
of
course,
i
--
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
believe
the
testimony
was
that
he
did
go
into
the
glove
compartment
and
eventually
he
even
removed
the
backseat
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
trunk.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
he
went
into
the
--
i
think
he
said
--
no,
i'm
mistaken.
he
did
go
into
the
search
--
the
truck
with
a
search
warrant
but
he
said
it
was
the
practice
of
the
police
department
that
where
they
couldn't
get
into
the
trunk
that
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
trunk
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
--
through
the
backseat.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
say
so.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
it
would
show
that
they
were
going
into
all
areas
of
the
car
that
then
--
they
weren't
gong
to
restrict
themselves
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
inventory
regulation
is
a
regulation
would
--
which
purports
to
allow
the
police
wherever
they
have
lawful
custody
of
an
automobile
to
conduct
a
general
search
of
that
automobile,
inventorying
it
and
removing
any
and
all
property
which
they
may
find
in
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
what
the
--
what
they
found
would
justify
their
entry
into
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
question
the
entry
into
the
car
for
the
purposes
of
removing
the
valuables.
the
entry
into
the
car
for
the
--
in
this
case
was
illegal
when
he
found
that
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no
i
don't.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i
think
that
at
that
point
he
should've
go
and
gotten
a
search
warrant.
he
had
probable
cause
at
that
point
to
go
and
apply
for
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
he
removed
the
car
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
make
that
statement.
once
he
made
that
entry,
once
he
open
up
the
door
to
the
car,
mr.
justice
white,
the
physical
intrusion
was
there
regardless
of
what
happened
to
that
is
irrelevant.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
opening
of
the
door.
but
there's
--
where
you
have
a
search
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
regardless
of
what
he
found
doesn't
justify
his
entry
into
the
vehicle.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
there
was
nothing
to
suppress
at
that
point.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
it's
my
point
that
whatever
he
--
well,
of
course
i
have
to
limit
that
again
to
my
defensive
argument
that
the
police
have
a
problem
here
but
they
ought
to
be
restricted
as
to
what
they
can
find
and
only
be
able
to
use
it
defensively
against
this
man.
there
is
no
--
in
today's
age
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
this
is
a
federal
case.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
in
answer
to
that,
we
would
--
you
would
have
to
engage
in
determining
what
the
purpose
of
the
intent
or
motive
of
the
police
officer
was
when
he
went
out
to
search
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes
it
is.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
because
the
--
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
car
even
in
that
--
was
used
in
the
robbery,
even
announced
to
the
officer
at
the
time
he
arrested
them
that
he
was
seized
in
this
car
for
evidence.
so
the
--
it
was
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
search
warrant
as
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct
as
was
in
--
announced
in
preston.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
you
should.
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
and
discover
the
evidence?
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
my
position
that
once
he
opens
that
door
there
is
an
intrusion
in
violation
of
this
fourth
amendment
rights.
if
he
discovered
the
evidence
regardless
of
whether
he
was
going
out
there
just
to
roll
the
window
up,
the
minute
he
opened
that
door,
he
was
intruding
in
the
privacy
of
the
man's
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
they
do.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
we
have
a
different
situation
here,
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
think
he
would
be
violating
i
think
he
would
fall
within
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
he
would
fall
within
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
contemporaneous
thereto.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
i
believe
the
police
--
the
crane
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
to
roll
up
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
and
he
was
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
must
point
out
he
was
also
told
that
he
didn't
wish
do
disturb
any
fingerprints
that
might
be
on
the
vehicle.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
thank
you.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is

the

the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
metropolitan
police
department
in
this
case
is
cited
on
page

of
my
brief.
during
the
late
evening
hours
of
august
29th,
1964
at
approximately
11:45
pm
that
evening,
a
york
robbery
occurred
in
the
5500
block
of
13th
street,
northwest
washington
dc.
among
one
of
the
articles
taken
from
the
victim
that
evening
was
a
registration
card
to
his
automobile
bearing
his
name
and
identification
of
that
automobile.
an
off-duty
police
officer
at
approximately
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
observed
three
colored
males
running
north
on
13th
street
and
enter
a
ford
automobile.
the
officer
wrote
down
a
description
of
the
automobile
and
the
tag
number.
he
phoned
this
description
in
to
the
sixth
precinct
approximately
five
to
10
minutes
after
he
observed
the
three
males
running
north
on
13th
street.
the
next
day
another
police
officer
was
assigned
to
investigate
this
robbery.
and
at
that
time
was
given
a
description
of
the
automobile
and
the
tag
number.
the
police
officer
at
that
time
checked
with
the
motor
vehicle
department
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
ascertain
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
owner
of
that
automobile
and
also
that
the
car
was
registered
to
a
premises
in
the
vicinity
of
the
2500
block
of
m
street,
northwest.
the
police
officer
preceded
to
the
area
the
2500
block
of
m
street
northwest,
at
which
time,
he
saw
the
petitioner
in
this
case
attempt
to
enter
his
automobile.
the
officer
testified
that
the
petitioner
had
opened
the
door
to
his
car
when
he
approached
him,
asked
him
his
name,
placed
him
under
arrest
for
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
a
police
cruiser
at
that
point.
the
arresting
officer
conducted
a
cursory
search
of
the
automobile
to
see
whether
or
not
there
were
any
weapons
in
the
automobile.
he
found
none.
he
then
called
for
a
police
crane
to
come
and
tow
the
vehicle
to
the
sixth
precinct.
the
car
was
left
on
the
m
street
--at
1m
street
unlocked
and
unattended
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
police
crane.
the
arresting
officer
and
his
partner
transported
the
petitioner
via
a
police
cruiser
to
the
sixth
precinct
which
was
a
ride
of
10
to
20
minutes
and
was
approximately
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
place
of
arrest.
the
time
of
arrest
without
any
warrant
was
estimated
to
be
at
1:30
pm
in
the
afternoon.
at
approximately
3:00
pm
the
same
day,
the
operator
of
the
crane
arrived
at
the
sixth
precinct
and
informed
the
arresting
officer
that
the
car
was
on
the
lot
inside
of
the
precinct.
he
notified
the
officer
that
there
was
a
light
rain
falling,
and
that
he
did
not
roll
up
the
windows
because
he
did
not
want
to
disturb
any
finger
prints
which
may
have
been
found
on
the
automobile.
officer
baker
who
was
the
arresting
officer
went
out
to
the
automobile
to
make
an
inventory
search
pursuant
to
the
police
regulation
which
is
cited
again
on
page
3
of
my
brief.
officer
baker
first
went
and
put
a
property
tag
on
the
steering
wheel.
he
then
proceeded
into
the
car.
he
searched
the
glove
compartment,
the
rear
of
the
car
and
he
also
testified
that
he
looked
behind
the
sun
visor.
he
found
nothing
to
remove
from
the
car.
he
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
around
to
the
passenger
side.
he
opened
up
the
right
front
door
to
roll
up
the
window
to
protect
it
from
the
rain.
at
this
point,
lying
on
the
door
well
with
the
automobile
was
a
registration
card
belonging
to
the
victim
of
the
robbery
that
occurred
the
night
before.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
it
was.
it
was
the
right
door
well
on
the
right
front
door.
after
the
officer
discovered
the
registration
card,
he
left
the
door
opened.
he
left
the
registration
card
lying
in
the
well.
he
went
into
the
precinct
and
brought
the
petitioner
back
and
confronted
him
with
the
evidence
which
he
found.
he
then
took
the
evidence,
turned
it
over
to
the
police
property
clerk.
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
the
court
and
obtained
a
search
warrant
directed
to
the
police
property
clerk
to
seize
the
registration
card
which
he
had
found
the
day
before.
officer
baker
testified
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
find
and
protect
property
which
may
have
been
in
the
car
pursuant
to
the
police
regulation
which
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
on
a
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence,
it
was
denied.
however
the
district
court
found
that
the
police
officer
had
more
than
one
thing
in
mind
when
he
went
out
to
look
at
this
car.
at
page
118
of
the
record,
the
district
judge
stated
that
not
only
did
he
go
out
to
protect
the
automobile
from
the
elements
or
to
remove
property,
but
in
fact
he
did
conduct
a
search
of
that
automobile
for
that
he
eventually
opened
up
the
trunk
of
the
car
which
was
locked.
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
has
laid
down
procedures
to
be
followed
where
police
officers
want
to
search
areas
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
most
recently,
this
doctrine
was
reaffirmed
in
katz
versus
the
united
states
in
which
the
court
said
that
searches
conducted
outside
the
judicial
process
without
prior
approval
by
judge
of
magistrate
are
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
only
to
a
few
specifically
established
and
well
delineated
exceptions.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
police
have
administrative
problem.
i
would
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
restrict
the
use
of
any
incriminating
evidence
which
they
may
find
pursuant
to
an
administrative
search.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
i
would
ask
though
that
any
incriminating
evidence
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct,
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
perfectly
proper.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
they
ought
to
do
this
but
they
should
not.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct
unless
they
comply
with
the
exceptions
or
unless
the
case
falls
within
the
exceptions
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
in
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
first,
it
doesn't
fall
with
any
of
the
--
within
any
of
the
exceptions
as
announced
by
this
court
previously.
that
is
the
two
exceptions
announced
in
preston
nor
the
forfeiture
statute
that
was
a
--
in
proof.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
this
way.
the
intent
of
the
police
department
in
protecting
the
property
is
not
determinative
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amend
--
or
a
persons
fourth
amendment's
rights.
the
motive
or
intent
maybe
perfectly
alright
but
they're
encroaching
on
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
go
into
the
petitioner's
automobile
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
am
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
there
is
no
indication
that
he
was
ever
asked
whether
or
not
the
officer
could
inventory
the
car.
there
was
no
consent
given
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no
it's
not.
i
--
they
had
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
impound
the
car.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
on
the
theory
that
if
they
had
let
--
they
could
have
left
the
car
on
the
street
if
they
have
locked
it
up.
they
did
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
car
may
have
been
connected
with
a
robbery
that
occurred
the
night
before
and
if
they
had
a
description
and
the
tag
known.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
car
was
used
in
a
robbery.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
believe
he
was.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes
he
was.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
connection
there
was
his
car
to
him.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
now
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
your,
honor
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
car
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
following
preston.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
once
he
makes
a
physical
intrusion
into
this
car
regardless
of
his
motive
and
seizes
incriminating
evidence,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
did
admit
that
that
conduct
was
lawful
because
of
the
administrative
problem
that
the
police
have.
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
protect
themselves
against
a
lawsuit
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
--
for
stole
--
for
articles
being
stolen
or
for
negligence.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
i'll
get
to
it
this
way.
the
search
being
conducted
by
the
metropolitan
police
department
is
one
in
administrative
search
which
was
struck
down
by
camera
and
see.
second,
it
gets
around
the
particularity
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
it
strikes
it
down
in
this
respect
that
he
can't
use
the
administrative
search
without
a
warrant
to
secure
evidence.
and
this
is
what
we're
getting
at.
the
administrative
search
here
was
not
designed
only
to
protect
the
--
it
wasn't
limited
only
to
the
protection
of
the
valuables
or
the
petitioner's
automobile,
but
it
also
allowed
then
to
seize
any
evidence
which
they
may
have
found
in
the
automobile
--
in
the
car.
you
have
a
general
and
exploratory
search
without
particularly
describing
the
things
to
be
seized
in
the
vehicle
at
the
time
that
they
seized
it.
so,
it
violates
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
seized
the
incriminating
evidence
pursuant
to
this
general
search.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
i
am
saying
that
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
it
was
lawful
on
one
side
and
unlawful
for
the
reason
that
he
seized
the
evidence.
that
is
--
there
is
the
--
the
problem
here
is
that
they
have
to
inventory
these
cars
and
yet
i'm
asking
this
court
that
were
there
searching
or
inventorying
a
car
pursuant
to
that
police
regulation
and
they
find
incriminating
evidence,
they
should
be
restricted.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
this
incriminating
evidence
although
they
should
be
allowed
to
remove
the
valuables
from
the
car.
applying
the
exceptions
in
preston
versus
united
states
that
is
that
the
police
have
a
right
to
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
contemporaneous
thereto,
the
facts
in
this
case
certainly
don't
justify
a
search
of
this
vehicle
an
hour
and
a
half
later
and
at
the
police
station,
five
or
six
miles
away.
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
that
police
officer
conducted
the
inventory
search
at
the
police
precinct.
and
the
third
exception
is
announced
in
cooper
versus
california
where
in
the
state
legislature
had
passed
the
statute
forfeiting
the
automobile
to
the
state
in
certain
types
of
crimes.
there
is
no
such
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia,
therefore
the
search
pursuant
to
--
that
statute
would
not
be
lawful
in
this
instance.
the
administrative
search
in
my
opinion
is
also
violated
from
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
was
a
part
of
a
general
practice
of
making
general
searches
of
all
automobiles
that
came
into
police
custody.
if
this
general
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
administrative
search
mr.
justice
black
is
a
regulation
promulgated
here
by
the
metropolitan
police
department.
they
were
or
able
to
promulgate
regulations
directing
the
police
officers
without
either
legislative
authority
or
judicial
authority
to
do
certain
things
which
they
may
not
otherwise
have
been
able
to
do.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
say
it
was
valid
for
the
--
for
defensive
purposes
to
protect
the
police
department
against
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
my
--
basically
my
case.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i'm
not
asking
to
overrule
abbot.
as
i
recollect,
there
was
a
lawful
--
there
was
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
in
abbot.
this
a
search
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
it
took
place
sometime
later.
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
overrule
abbot
your
honor.
of
course,
i
--
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
believe
the
testimony
was
that
he
did
go
into
the
glove
compartment
and
eventually
he
even
removed
the
backseat
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
trunk.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
he
went
into
the
--
i
think
he
said
--
no,
i'm
mistaken.
he
did
go
into
the
search
--
the
truck
with
a
search
warrant
but
he
said
it
was
the
practice
of
the
police
department
that
where
they
couldn't
get
into
the
trunk
that
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
trunk
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
--
through
the
backseat.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
would
say
so.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
it
would
show
that
they
were
going
into
all
areas
of
the
car
that
then
--
they
weren't
gong
to
restrict
themselves
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
inventory
regulation
is
a
regulation
would
--
which
purports
to
allow
the
police
wherever
they
have
lawful
custody
of
an
automobile
to
conduct
a
general
search
of
that
automobile,
inventorying
it
and
removing
any
and
all
property
which
they
may
find
in
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
what
the
--
what
they
found
would
justify
their
entry
into
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
question
the
entry
into
the
car
for
the
purposes
of
removing
the
valuables.
the
entry
into
the
car
for
the
--
in
this
case
was
illegal
when
he
found
that
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no
i
don't.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i
think
that
at
that
point
he
should've
go
and
gotten
a
search
warrant.
he
had
probable
cause
at
that
point
to
go
and
apply
for
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
he
removed
the
car
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
make
that
statement.
once
he
made
that
entry,
once
he
open
up
the
door
to
the
car,
mr.
justice
white,
the
physical
intrusion
was
there
regardless
of
what
happened
to
that
is
irrelevant.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
the
opening
of
the
door.
but
there's
--
where
you
have
a
search
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
regardless
of
what
he
found
doesn't
justify
his
entry
into
the
vehicle.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
there
was
nothing
to
suppress
at
that
point.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
it's
my
point
that
whatever
he
--
well,
of
course
i
have
to
limit
that
again
to
my
defensive
argument
that
the
police
have
a
problem
here
but
they
ought
to
be
restricted
as
to
what
they
can
find
and
only
be
able
to
use
it
defensively
against
this
man.
there
is
no
--
in
today's
age
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
no,
this
is
a
federal
case.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
well,
in
answer
to
that,
we
would
--
you
would
have
to
engage
in
determining
what
the
purpose
of
the
intent
or
motive
of
the
police
officer
was
when
he
went
out
to
search
the
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes
it
is.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
because
the
--
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
car
even
in
that
--
was
used
in
the
robbery,
even
announced
to
the
officer
at
the
time
he
arrested
them
that
he
was
seized
in
this
car
for
evidence.
so
the
--
it
was
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
search
warrant
as
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
that
is
correct
as
was
in
--
announced
in
preston.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
you
should.
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
and
discover
the
evidence?
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
my
position
that
once
he
opens
that
door
there
is
an
intrusion
in
violation
of
this
fourth
amendment
rights.
if
he
discovered
the
evidence
regardless
of
whether
he
was
going
out
there
just
to
roll
the
window
up,
the
minute
he
opened
that
door,
he
was
intruding
in
the
privacy
of
the
man's
automobile.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
they
do.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
we
have
a
different
situation
here,
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
don't
think
he
would
be
violating
i
think
he
would
fall
within
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
think
he
would
fall
within
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
contemporaneous
thereto.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
i
believe
the
police
--
the
crane
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
to
roll
up
the
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
yes,
and
he
was
--
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
i
must
point
out
he
was
also
told
that
he
didn't
wish
do
disturb
any
fingerprints
that
might
be
on
the
vehicle.
mr.
paul
h.
weinstein
thank
you.
