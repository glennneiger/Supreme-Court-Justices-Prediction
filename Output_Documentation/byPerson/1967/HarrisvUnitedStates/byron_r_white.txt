justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
--
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
police
property
clerk
could
have
the
duty
of
examining
automobiles
that
have
been
impounded
legally
and
had
gone
and
searched
the
car
in
a
routine
search
or
to
pick
up
--
to
inventory
personal
property
and
to
put
it
in
the
lock
box
or
in
a
check
room
or
something
and
had
discovered
the
same
statement
and
had
to
call
somebody's
attention
to
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say,
make
--
be
making
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
irrelevant
then
--
what
the
purpose
was
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
in
other
words
that
this
search
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
property
for
safe
keeping
perfectly
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
thing
the
police
ought
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
find
is
incriminating
and
cannot
be
used
in
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
would
you
think
that
though
that
the
rule
of
admissibility
is
--
had
been
admissibility
is
certainly
based
on
unreasonable
search
and
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
officers
--
if
it's
quite
proper
and
legal
for
the
police
to
make
a
--
examine
a
car
and
--
with
the
purpose
of
safe
keeping
articles
at
that
point,
you
wouldn't
say
there's
any
violation
of
anybody's
rights.
this
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
problem
or
anything
like
that.
this
is
a
question
of
inadmissibility
of
evidence
to
enforce
some
subsidy
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me
what
the
unreasonable
police
conduct
is
if
it
has
been
the
administrative
--
if
it
would've
been
the
property
clerk
making
a
routine
check
of
the
articles?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you've
just
told
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that's
perfectly
all
right
for
the
police
to
make
these
examinations.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
at
the
time
the
property
clerk
inventories
these
evidence
and
picks
it
up
and
puts
it
in
a
box
in
--
for
safekeeping.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
deny
that
--
lets
assume
you
--
that
the
trunk
was
not
locked
and
the
administrative
clerk
is
inventorying
the
car.
so
he
opens
the
back
in
and
gets
in
and
inventories
how
many
spare
tires,
chains,
etcetera
at
the
back.
now,
that
is
a
--
to
the
extent
that
it's
legal
at
all,
that
its
legal
as
looking
in
the
front,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
is
locked?
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
--
which
makes
any
--
that
makes
any
difference
to
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
they're
going
into
all
areas
of
the
car
where
it
might
--
where
normally
you
follow
--
you
find
personal
property
to
be
inventoried.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
a
search
warrant,
if
it
was
really
a
search
warrant
issued
on
probable
cause
to
search
a
car
might
authorize
the
officers
to
search
parts
of
the
car
that
no
custodial
purpose
would
ever
permit
them
to
search.
let's
assume
they
had
some
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
--
that
there
were
--
narcotics
were
secured
in
the
upholstery
of
the
car.
i
suppose
they
can
look
in
the
upholstery
of
the
cars,
tear
it
up.
but
i
doubt
if
--
i
doubt
just
an
administrative
--
you
should
search
the
car
to
inventory
and
to
safeguard
personal
property
but
permits
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
at
this
point
yet
--
though,
you
don't
seem
to
really
--
to
question
the
entry
into
this
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
be
the
--
it
would've
been
alright
if
he
had
left
the
car
lying
there,
got
the
search
warrant,
and
came
back
to
pick
it
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
illegal
--
that
was
legal
at
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what
if
he
hadn't
found
anything?
would
you
have
said
he
had
to
--
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
to
suppress
but
it
doesn't
bring
in
what
--
but
there
was
a
--
was
there
an
unlawful
intrusion
into
privacy
or
into
a
protected
area
when
he
opened
the
car
--
that
car
door
regardless
of
what
he
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
difficulty
is
that
--
your
difficulty
is
what's
--
is
the
--
what
the
court
has
said
with
respects
to
the
function
of
the
exclusionary
rule
serves.
certainly,
a
good
many
years
ago,
well,
not
too
long
though
either,
it
was
--
this
is
a
state
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
had
been,
it
has
--
well,
even
a
good
many
years
ago,
there
would've
been
any
question
of
what
illegal
evidence
would've
been
admissible
in
spite
of
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
inadmissibility
serves
a
purpose.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
--
i
still
have
some
trouble
was
whether
that
purpose
observed
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you
really
saying
then
is
that
the
--
since
i
had
him
under
arrest
and
they
had
reason
to
think
that
this
car
may
have
been
the
vehicle
in
connection
with
the
robbery?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
what
they
should've
done
once
they
had
him
in
custody
was
to
get
a
--
not
to
employ
this
type
of
regulation.
which
should
then
and
there
have
gone
to
get
a
search
warrant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
search
that
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
have
probable
cause
you
ought
to
use
it
for
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
here
the
officer
did
what
--
it
seems
to
be
conceded
the
police
can
do
in
a
sense
they
looked
in
the
car
or
maybe
administrative
purposes.
and
they
found
the
card
and
they
didn't
--
they
then
gave
it
to
the
property
clerk
which
is
where
personal
property
found
on
the
car
should
go.
then
they
got
a
search
warrant.
they
got
a
--
they
went
to
a
judge
and
said,
"we
have
a
probable
cause
to
seize
this
card",
and
they
get
the
warrant
and
seized
it.
is
that
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
this
a
reasonable
for
the
police
to
inventory
the
contents
of
the
car
seized
for
illegal
parking
as
it
is
to
inventory
this
car
which
has
been
seized
in
connection
with
the
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
your
--
what
if
somebody
starts
to
ask
him
questions
just
as
a
witness
here,
just
to
investigate
him,
asks
him
some
questions
to
see
a
brown
paper
sack
on
the
table.
and
you
asked
him
what's
in
it,
and
he
says,
“it's
none
of
your
business”.
and
so
you
go
over
and
tear
open
the
sack
and
you
find
two
guns
in
it.
you
had
no
--
and
it's
admitted
you
had
no
probable
cause
to
believe
no
--
that
there
wasn't
anything
in
the
sack
for
that
matter.
you
hadn't
intended
to
arrest
him
or
anything
else
when
you
went
there.
i
don't
suppose
you
could
do
any
--
do
that
and
even
more,
you
can
go
look
in
the
closet,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
--
would
you
be
making
the
