mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
i
think
illustrates
the
growth
and
development
of
constitutional
law
and
practice
in
this
country.
of
course
in
the
sense,
the
problem
of
intergovernmental
immunities
goes
back
to
the
early
days,
mcculloch
and
maryland,
but
i
suppose
that
two
years
ago
--
excuse
me,
two
generations
ago,
two
generations
go,
no
one
would
have
been
here
standing
in
my
place
seeking
to
support
a
statute
such
as
this,
among
other
things
there
was
no
such
statute.
we
should
not
forget
however
that
it
was
about
two
generations
ago
that
south
carolina
against
united
states
was
decided
which
held
that
the
united
states
could
impose
a
tax
on
an
activity
conducted
by
the
state
of
south
carolina.
one
generation
ago,
there
were
marked
developments
in
this
area,
particularly
in
the
tax
field.
there
was
a
whole
series
of
cases
which
step
by
step
moved
along
and
eventually
broke
down
in
large
measure,
the
rigidities
of
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunities
--
intergovernmental
immunities
in
the
tax
field.
i
think
it's
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
too
that
it
was
48
years
ago
next
month
that
a
very
parallel
case
was
argued
before
the
high
court
of
australia,
the
engineers
case
which
is
reported
in
28
common
law
of
law
reports
at
page
129
which
involved
the
power
of
the
commonwealth
to
enact
a
statute
subjecting
state
employees,
in
this
case
it's
railroad,
to
the
compulsory
arbitration
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia.
i
was
reading
about
this
just
the
other
evening
and
noted
that
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
in
that
case
was
robert
gordon
menzies
and
every
state,
but
one
joined
in
opposition
to
the
statute
there
and
counsel
for
the
states
included
john
g.
latham
who
later
became
chief
justice
of
the
high
court
of
australia
and
herbert
evatt
who
was
later
a
justice
of
the
high
court.
in
this
case,
the
syllogism,
it
seems
to
me
it's
fairly
clear.
i
know
the
dangers
of
syllogisms
and
the
risk
that
a
legal
problem
may
be
over
simplified
by
treating
it
in
unduly
logical
terms,
nevertheless
it
maybe
of
assistance
to
see
how
this
case
fits
into
the
constitutional
picture.
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
operation
of
schools
and
hospitals
is
an
activity
which
affects
commerce.
the
stipulations
in
this
case
show
that
the
schools
and
hospitals
in
the
states
here
involved
affect
the
commerce
in
a
very
substantial
way.
the
court
below
and
its
opinion
and
its
quoted
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
in
reference
to
the
stipulation
which
says
that
in
the
current
fiscal
year
which
was
two
or
three
years
ago,
an
estimated
33
and
three
tenths
billion
dollars
will
be
spent
by
state
and
local
public
educational
institutions
in
the
unites
states
in
the
same
fiscal
year
of
1965.
these
authority
spent
$3.9
billion
operating
public
hospitals.
if
it
were
not
the
states
which
were
conducting
these
activities,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
power
of
congress
to
make
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applicable
to
schools
and
hospitals.
we
know
that
the
act
is
applicable
to
retail
stores.
we
have
cases
like
the
heart
of
atlanta
case
involving
the
extension
of
the
commerce
power
to
a
restaurant.
if
these
were
privately
conducted
schools
and
hospitals,
i
think
it
could
be
hard
to
find
counsel
who
would
come
here
and
contend
that
the
act
of
congress
involved
was
not
a
regulation
of
activities
which
substantially
affect
commerce
among
the
several
states.
so
we
are
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
commerce.
i
suggest
that
that's
really
beyond
the
realm
of
dispute
now
and
that
is
the
first
proposition
of
the
syllogism.
under
the
constitution,
the
congress
has
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
this
is
a
power
granted
without
qualification
in
terms.
it
applies
to
all
commerce
even
that
conducted
by
or
for
the
state.
and
thus
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
matter
which
substantially
affects
commerce
and
since
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce
extends
to
commerce
conducted
by
a
state,
we
come
to
our
conclusion
that
congress
has
power
to
regulate
wages
and
hours
of
employees
in
schools
and
hospitals
even
though
these
are
conducted
by
a
state.
are
there
any
flaws
in
this
process?
are
there
subtleties
or
refinements
which
had
been
overlooked
or
submerged
in
the
reasoning
eye
of
outline?
i
do
not
think
so.
for
many
years
in
the
area
of
intergovernmental
immunities
in
the
tax
field,
the
court
labored
to
workout
a
distinction
between
activities
which
were
governmental
in
nature
and
those
which
were
proprietary
in
nature.
some
of
the
tax
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
here
have
been
distinguished
by
my
learned
friends
on
that
ground.
this
distinction
was
undoubtedly
a
useful
stage
in
the
process,
but
it
was
found
in
due
course
that
the
distinction
is
one
which
did
not
prove
to
be
useful
in
the
long
run.
on
what
basis
is
such
a
matter
to
be
determined
as
far
as
such
a
case
as
this
is
concerned.
historically,
neither
elementary
schools
nor
hospitals
were
conducted
by
states.
they
are
not
analytically
a
part
of
governmental
activity
like
legislatures
and
courts.
in
more
recent
times,
the
states
have
become
extensively
involved
in
elementary
education
and
hospitals,
but
these
activities
are
not
exclusively
conducted
by
states
and
any
of
the
plaintiff
states.
the
congress
has
long
followed
a
policy
of
regulating
wages
and
hours
of
work
and
activities
which
affect
commerce
and
has
been
steadily
extending
its
legislation
to
cover
a
very
large
part
of
the
total
area
where
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
it
is
earnestly
contended
here
that
this
regulation
is
not
necessary
and
it
is
not
valid
because
the
operation
of
schools
and
hospitals
to
quote
from
one
of
the
headings
in
the
state's
brief,
does
not
constitute
commerce
and
does
not
affect
commerce
in
a
way
which
subjects
them
to
congressional
regulation.
the
argument
in
support
of
this
is
put
almost
entirely
in
competitive
terms.
it
is
suggested
for
example
that
private
schools
and
hospitals
will
not
have
difficulty
in
competing
if
they
are
subjected
to
federal
wage
and
hour
regulation
while
state
schools
and
hospitals
are
not
because
competition
between
these
groups
does
not
exist
and
to
the
extent
it
does
exist,
it
is
not
on
a
price
basis.
i'm
not
sure
that
even
in
the
area
of
competition
that
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
recent
years,
we
have
developed
enormous
systems
of
insurance
with
respect
to
medical
cost.
this
is
true
at
least
as
far
as
the
hospitals
are
concerned
and
not
only
blue
cross
on
a
national
scale,
but
private
insurance
plans
and
payments
are
made
in
very
large
amounts
to
state
and
other
public
institutions
for
medical
and
hospital
service
and
there
may
well
be
competition
between
the
two,
but
i
don't
think
that's
important.
i
don't
think
that
competition
is
the
ground
upon
which
this
statute
should
particularly
be
rested
even
though
that
is
the
matter
which
was
referred
to
in
the
committee
report
which
related
to
hospitals.
incidentally
it
is
true
as
far
as
elementary
and
secondary
education
is
concerned
that
this
statute
was
passed
in
what
might
be
called
almost
casual
manner.
there
were
no
hearings,
but
i
don't
know
that
congress
is
under
any
obligation
to
hold
hearings.
there
are
no
findings
in
the
statute,
but
there
are
no
constitutional
requirement
that
there
would
be
findings
in
the
statute.
the
speculation
is
that
the
provision
with
respect
to
elementary
and
secondary
schools
was
put
in
by
an
opponent
by
the
bill
who
wanted
to
sink
it
by
putting
in
so
many
things
that
people
wouldn't
vote
for
it.
apparently
to
his
surprise,
it
was
adopted
and
then
accepted
by
the
conference
committee.
all
of
which
i
think
is
irrelevant
because
it
is
in
the
statute
as
passed
by
congress
and
as
we
see
it,
it
was
plainly
within
the
power
of
congress.
but
as
i
have
said,
though
i
think
there
is
competition
and
i
think
it
could
be
advanced
in
terms
of
competition,
that
isn't
the
only
basis
upon
which
congress
can
exercise
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
the
constitution
doesn't
say
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
competition
in
interstate
commerce.
it
says,
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
federal
state
--
among
the
several
states.
and
the
congress
seeks
to
regulate
wages
and
hours
not
merely
to
provide
a
better
basis
for
truly
fair
competition,
but
also
to
minimize
work
stoppages
from
legitimate
employee
discontent
and
also
to
increase
purchasing
power
which
will
directly
affect
the
flow
of
goods
in
commerce.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
i
suggest
that
the
succession
of
statutes
which
the
congress
passed
beginning
in
the
1930s,
not
only
fair
labor
standards
act
but
also
on
employment
insurance
and
old
age
and
survivors
insurance
has
had
an
enormous
impact
on
the
development
and
continuity
of
commerce
and
of
commerce
among
the
several
states
in
this
country.
the
strikes
in
schools
and
even
in
hospitals
are
not
unknown
even
in
this
area.
we've
cited
on
page
12
of
our
brief
an
important
study
of
strikes
by
public
employees
which
deals
among
other
things
with
the
strikes
by
public
employees
in
schools
and
hospitals.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
matter
which
is
born
in
upon
our
consciousness
over
the
past
few
weeks.
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
employees
in
public
schools
and
hospitals
who
receive
less
than
the
minimum
wage
or
work
more
than
maximum
hours
are
in
the
poverty
group
and
the
congress
might
well
feel
that
removing
a
part
of
the
economic
discrimination
against
them
which
they've
long
contended
against
could
have
an
important
bearing
on
maintaining
the
stability
of
the
free
flow
of
commerce
in
the
institutions
in
which
these
people
worked.
what
is
the
web
of
cases
which
has
been
spun
over
the
past
40
years
or
more
and
which
i
suggest
now
enmeshes
the
plaintiffs
here.
perhaps,
the
earliest
case
that
need
to
be
mentioned
is
sanitary
district
of
chicago
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1925.
this
involved
a
clearly
governmental
activity,
namely
the
disposition
of
sewage
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
had
a
direct
relation
to
the
health
of
chicago
and
of
other
parts
of
the
country.
this
court
held
that
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
regulating
that
activity
under
the
commerce
clause
was
valid
and
that
speaking
through
mr.
justice
holmes,
the
power
and
authority
of
the
united
states
to
remove
obstructions
to
interstate
foreign
commerce
was
without
question
superior
to
that
of
the
states
to
provide
for
the
welfare
or
necessities
of
their
inhabitants.
then
the
next
case
came
along,
united
states
against
california,
involving
the
san
francisco
belt
harbor
railroad
and
the
question
was
whether
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
applicable
to
such
a
railroad
conducted
by
the
state.
now
my
friends
here
of
course
seek
to
distinguish
the
case
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
proprietary
activity,
the
distinction
which
was
developed
in
the
tax
cases,
but
which
was
later
pretty
thoroughly
disposed
of,
but
in
that
case
the
court
was
very
specific.
it
said
“that
it
deemed
it
unimportant
to
say
whether
the
state
conducts
its
railroad
in
its
sovereign
or
in
its
private
capacity.”
in
whatever
capacity
the
court
said,
“the
state's
power
must
be
insubordination
to
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
which
has
been
granted
specifically
to
the
national
government.”
in
somewhat
similar
case
that
i'll
take
up
out
of
chronological
order
is
california
against
taylor
which
involved
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
the
same
railroad
and
the
court
there
said
that
the
state
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
has
subjected
itself
to
the
commerce
power
so
that
congress
can
regulate
its
employment
relationships,
now
that
of
course
gets
very
close
to
this.
a
case
which
i
think
is
of
special
importance
here
and
one
for
which
i
have
certain
nostalgic
feeling
since
i
wrote
the
brief
for
the
government
in
it,
is
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
illinois
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1933.
it
was
argued
here
by
judge
thacher
as
solicitor
general.
that
involved
the
application
of
customs
duties
to
scientific
apparatus
which
was
imported
by
the
university
of
illinois
and
i
remember
well
in
the
consideration
of
the
case
the
discussion
of
the
relative
position
of
the
taxing
power
and
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
we
deliberately
based
the
brief
in
that
case
on
the
commerce
power.
we
made
only
casual
or
incidental
reference
to
the
taxing
power.
i
would
point
out
too
that
that
case
involves
education.
this
was
the
university
of
illinois,
an
educational
institution
and
the
items
which
were
imported
were
scientific
equipment
for
use
in
the
education
enterprise.
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes,
a
very,
well
i
want
to
say
a
curt
but
a
short
opinion,
referred
to
the
commerce
power
as
an
exclusive
power
and
its
exercise
may
not
be
limited,
qualified
or
impeded
to
any
extent
by
state
action
and
he
then
went
on
to
say
the
fact
that
the
state
in
the
performance
of
state
functions
may
use
imported
articles
does
not
mean
that
the
importation
is
a
function
of
the
state
government
independent
of
federal
power.
the
control
of
importation
does
not
rest
with
the
state,
but
with
the
congress.
there
is
thus
no
violation
of
the
principle
which
the
petitioner
invokes
which
was
the
principle
of
intergovernmental
immunities
for
there
is
no
encroachment
on
the
power
of
the
state
as
none
exists
with
respect
to
the
subject
over
which
the
federal
power
has
been
exerted.
mr.
griswold
someone
may
have
to
argue
that
someday
before
--
mr.
griswold
if
there
is
no
qualification
whatever,
it
would
seem
to
go
that
far
and
if
congress
should
which
currently
i
suppose
is
unlikely
to
pass
a
statute
regulating
minimum
wages
and
overtime
for
employees
of
state
legislatures
or
of
the
state
courts,
it
would
be
possible
it
seems
to
me
to
defend
it.
it
would
be
a
harder
case
for
this
court
to
decide
on
what
this
case
is.
mr.
griswold
yes.
mr.
griswold
we've
gone
virtually
as
far
as
that
under
the
war
power
which
is
perhaps
a
somewhat
different
matter
but
--
mr.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
license
the
state
government
for
some
activities.
for
example
the
dispensing
of
narcotics
in
the
state
hospitals
i
suspect
is
done
under
federal
licensure
now
and
without
any
--
mr.
griswold
no.
governors
don't
have
a
federal
certificate
in
their
office
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
never
have
to
consider
that
question.
i
do
think
that
the
case
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
university
of
illinois
against
united
states
comes
very
close
to
this
case
when
you
get
done
to
it.
it's
easy
to
toss
it
off
and
say,
oh
it
was
a
tax.
it
wasn't
presented
on
the
basis
of
the
taxing
power.
it
wasn't
decided
on
the
bases
of
the
taxing
power.
it
was
decided
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
did
involve
education
and
it
did
sustain
the
federal
power
in
sweeping
terms.
now
the
next
one
of
these
cases
is
the
one
involving
price
control,
case
against
bowles
also
involves
education.
it
involved
the
sale
of
timber
from
lands
held
by
the
state
of
washington
for
the
support
of
public
schools
in
that
state
and
the
state
sought
to
sell
them
at
the
--
sell
the
timber
at
the
best
price
it
could
get
and
they
run
into
trouble
with
the
emergency
price
control
act
and
in
the
case
which
came
to
this
court,
the
power
of
congress
through
that
statute
to
regulate
the
prices
at
which
state
timber
could
be
sold
involving
proceeds
which
would
be
used
for
school
purposes,
that
statute
was
sustained.
and
now
finally,
we
have
a
very
recent
case,
the
significance
of
which
i
think
might
possibly
be
minimized
because
it
is
a
per
curiam
decision
and
somehow
or
rather
per
curiam
decisions
get
in
the
back
of
the
back
and
are
overlooked
unless
the
facts
aren't
stated
and
that
unless
they
are
specifically
brought
out,
they
sometimes
do
not
have
the
effect
that
case
have
decided
by
opinion
do
have.
the
case
i'm
referring
to
is
380
–
is
united
states
against
ohio
in
385
u.s.
at
page
9.
it's
not
in
the
back
of
the
back.
its
way
in
the
front
but
it's
only
two
lines
long.
united
states
against
ohio
involved
wheat
grown
on
a
state
prison
farm.
it
was
grown
by
the
state
of
ohio
without
complying
with
the
crop
restriction
provisions
of
a
federal
statute.
pursuant
to
an
opinion
of
the
state
attorney
general
that
since
it
was
a
state
and
since
under
the
constitution
of
ohio,
the
wheat
could
not
be
sold
outside
the
state
that
it
did
not
involve
commerce
and
was
not
subject
to
federal
regulation.
the
united
states
sued
to
collect
the
penalty
which
was
due
from
persons
who
operated
areas
growing
wheat
in
excess
of
their
allowance
and
the
district
court
granted
judgment
to
the
united
states
for
some
$27,000.00.
that
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
took
a
position
somewhat
like
that
presented
here
by
counsel
for
the
appellants.
they
said,
well,
this
is
such
a
little
effect
on
commerce
that
we
can't
really
suppose
that
it
ought
to
be
something
that
the
congress
could
regulate
and
they
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
in
the
summer
of
1966,
the
then
solicitor
general
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
with
this
court
to
review
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
october
of
that
year,
that
petition
was
granted
and
the
judgment
was
reversed
without
argument
here
on
the
authority
of
the
case
of
wickard
against
filburn
which
had
extended
the
--
which
had
sustained
the
extension
of
the
commerce
power
to
the
growing
of
crops.
now,
that
gets
even
closer
to
governmental
activity
it
seems
to
me
than
schools
and
hospitals.
prisons
have
long
been
a
governmental
activity
and
no
one
else
can
conduct
prisons.
it
doesn't
perhaps
go
as
far
as
legislatures
and
courts
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
suppose
however
if
the
legislature
itself
grew
some
wheat
that
this
case
would
be
applicable
to
it.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it's
very
hard
to
get
away
from
the
application
of
the
university
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
case.
there
is
one
more
case
mentioned
in
our
brief,
oklahoma
against
guy
f.
atkinson
company
where
it
was
contended
that
the
federal
government
have
no
power
to
build
a
dam
because
some
of
the
lands
which
would
be
affected
would
be
state
lands
and
this
was
important
not
merely
from
the
proprietary
point
of
view
but
also
from
the
governmental
point
of
view
because
it
would
interfere
with
the
state
taxing
power
and
among
other
things
in
some
way
would
obliterate
the
boundary
of
the
state,
but
the
court
had
no
difficulty
there
in
sustaining
the
power
of
congress
to
authorize
the
building
of
the
dam
under
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
a
number
of
other
cases
are
discussed
in
our
brief
and
even
more
in
the
brief
for
the
appellant
states.
they
seem
to
me
to
show
that
the
time
has
passed
when
the
argument
which
counsel
for
the
appellants
are
making
here
can
be
a
successfully
made.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
regulation
of
commerce
whether
it
is
one
which
should
be
made,
was
one
for
the
judgment
of
congress
and
congress
has
made
that
judgment
of
the
fact
that
states
are
affected
at
least
in
these
operations
is
not
sufficient
to
eliminate
the
power
of
congress
over
commerce
and
accordingly
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
i
think
illustrates
the
growth
and
development
of
constitutional
law
and
practice
in
this
country.
of
course
in
the
sense,
the
problem
of
intergovernmental
immunities
goes
back
to
the
early
days,
mcculloch
and
maryland,
but
i
suppose
that
two
years
ago
--
excuse
me,
two
generations
ago,
two
generations
go,
no
one
would
have
been
here
standing
in
my
place
seeking
to
support
a
statute
such
as
this,
among
other
things
there
was
no
such
statute.
we
should
not
forget
however
that
it
was
about
two
generations
ago
that
south
carolina
against
united
states
was
decided
which
held
that
the
united
states
could
impose
a
tax
on
an
activity
conducted
by
the
state
of
south
carolina.
one
generation
ago,
there
were
marked
developments
in
this
area,
particularly
in
the
tax
field.
there
was
a
whole
series
of
cases
which
step
by
step
moved
along
and
eventually
broke
down
in
large
measure,
the
rigidities
of
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunities
--
intergovernmental
immunities
in
the
tax
field.
i
think
it's
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
too
that
it
was
48
years
ago
next
month
that
a
very
parallel
case
was
argued
before
the
high
court
of
australia,
the
engineers
case
which
is
reported
in
28
common
law
of
law
reports
at
page
129
which
involved
the
power
of
the
commonwealth
to
enact
a
statute
subjecting
state
employees,
in
this
case
it's
railroad,
to
the
compulsory
arbitration
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia.
i
was
reading
about
this
just
the
other
evening
and
noted
that
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
in
that
case
was
robert
gordon
menzies
and
every
state,
but
one
joined
in
opposition
to
the
statute
there
and
counsel
for
the
states
included
john
g.
latham
who
later
became
chief
justice
of
the
high
court
of
australia
and
herbert
evatt
who
was
later
a
justice
of
the
high
court.
in
this
case,
the
syllogism,
it
seems
to
me
it's
fairly
clear.
i
know
the
dangers
of
syllogisms
and
the
risk
that
a
legal
problem
may
be
over
simplified
by
treating
it
in
unduly
logical
terms,
nevertheless
it
maybe
of
assistance
to
see
how
this
case
fits
into
the
constitutional
picture.
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
operation
of
schools
and
hospitals
is
an
activity
which
affects
commerce.
the
stipulations
in
this
case
show
that
the
schools
and
hospitals
in
the
states
here
involved
affect
the
commerce
in
a
very
substantial
way.
the
court
below
and
its
opinion
and
its
quoted
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
in
reference
to
the
stipulation
which
says
that
in
the
current
fiscal
year
which
was
two
or
three
years
ago,
an
estimated
33
and
three
tenths
billion
dollars
will
be
spent
by
state
and
local
public
educational
institutions
in
the
unites
states
in
the
same
fiscal
year
of
1965.
these
authority
spent
$3.9
billion
operating
public
hospitals.
if
it
were
not
the
states
which
were
conducting
these
activities,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
power
of
congress
to
make
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applicable
to
schools
and
hospitals.
we
know
that
the
act
is
applicable
to
retail
stores.
we
have
cases
like
the
heart
of
atlanta
case
involving
the
extension
of
the
commerce
power
to
a
restaurant.
if
these
were
privately
conducted
schools
and
hospitals,
i
think
it
could
be
hard
to
find
counsel
who
would
come
here
and
contend
that
the
act
of
congress
involved
was
not
a
regulation
of
activities
which
substantially
affect
commerce
among
the
several
states.
so
we
are
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
commerce.
i
suggest
that
that's
really
beyond
the
realm
of
dispute
now
and
that
is
the
first
proposition
of
the
syllogism.
under
the
constitution,
the
congress
has
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
this
is
a
power
granted
without
qualification
in
terms.
it
applies
to
all
commerce
even
that
conducted
by
or
for
the
state.
and
thus
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
matter
which
substantially
affects
commerce
and
since
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce
extends
to
commerce
conducted
by
a
state,
we
come
to
our
conclusion
that
congress
has
power
to
regulate
wages
and
hours
of
employees
in
schools
and
hospitals
even
though
these
are
conducted
by
a
state.
are
there
any
flaws
in
this
process?
are
there
subtleties
or
refinements
which
had
been
overlooked
or
submerged
in
the
reasoning
eye
of
outline?
i
do
not
think
so.
for
many
years
in
the
area
of
intergovernmental
immunities
in
the
tax
field,
the
court
labored
to
workout
a
distinction
between
activities
which
were
governmental
in
nature
and
those
which
were
proprietary
in
nature.
some
of
the
tax
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
here
have
been
distinguished
by
my
learned
friends
on
that
ground.
this
distinction
was
undoubtedly
a
useful
stage
in
the
process,
but
it
was
found
in
due
course
that
the
distinction
is
one
which
did
not
prove
to
be
useful
in
the
long
run.
on
what
basis
is
such
a
matter
to
be
determined
as
far
as
such
a
case
as
this
is
concerned.
historically,
neither
elementary
schools
nor
hospitals
were
conducted
by
states.
they
are
not
analytically
a
part
of
governmental
activity
like
legislatures
and
courts.
in
more
recent
times,
the
states
have
become
extensively
involved
in
elementary
education
and
hospitals,
but
these
activities
are
not
exclusively
conducted
by
states
and
any
of
the
plaintiff
states.
the
congress
has
long
followed
a
policy
of
regulating
wages
and
hours
of
work
and
activities
which
affect
commerce
and
has
been
steadily
extending
its
legislation
to
cover
a
very
large
part
of
the
total
area
where
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
it
is
earnestly
contended
here
that
this
regulation
is
not
necessary
and
it
is
not
valid
because
the
operation
of
schools
and
hospitals
to
quote
from
one
of
the
headings
in
the
state's
brief,
does
not
constitute
commerce
and
does
not
affect
commerce
in
a
way
which
subjects
them
to
congressional
regulation.
the
argument
in
support
of
this
is
put
almost
entirely
in
competitive
terms.
it
is
suggested
for
example
that
private
schools
and
hospitals
will
not
have
difficulty
in
competing
if
they
are
subjected
to
federal
wage
and
hour
regulation
while
state
schools
and
hospitals
are
not
because
competition
between
these
groups
does
not
exist
and
to
the
extent
it
does
exist,
it
is
not
on
a
price
basis.
i'm
not
sure
that
even
in
the
area
of
competition
that
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
recent
years,
we
have
developed
enormous
systems
of
insurance
with
respect
to
medical
cost.
this
is
true
at
least
as
far
as
the
hospitals
are
concerned
and
not
only
blue
cross
on
a
national
scale,
but
private
insurance
plans
and
payments
are
made
in
very
large
amounts
to
state
and
other
public
institutions
for
medical
and
hospital
service
and
there
may
well
be
competition
between
the
two,
but
i
don't
think
that's
important.
i
don't
think
that
competition
is
the
ground
upon
which
this
statute
should
particularly
be
rested
even
though
that
is
the
matter
which
was
referred
to
in
the
committee
report
which
related
to
hospitals.
incidentally
it
is
true
as
far
as
elementary
and
secondary
education
is
concerned
that
this
statute
was
passed
in
what
might
be
called
almost
casual
manner.
there
were
no
hearings,
but
i
don't
know
that
congress
is
under
any
obligation
to
hold
hearings.
there
are
no
findings
in
the
statute,
but
there
are
no
constitutional
requirement
that
there
would
be
findings
in
the
statute.
the
speculation
is
that
the
provision
with
respect
to
elementary
and
secondary
schools
was
put
in
by
an
opponent
by
the
bill
who
wanted
to
sink
it
by
putting
in
so
many
things
that
people
wouldn't
vote
for
it.
apparently
to
his
surprise,
it
was
adopted
and
then
accepted
by
the
conference
committee.
all
of
which
i
think
is
irrelevant
because
it
is
in
the
statute
as
passed
by
congress
and
as
we
see
it,
it
was
plainly
within
the
power
of
congress.
but
as
i
have
said,
though
i
think
there
is
competition
and
i
think
it
could
be
advanced
in
terms
of
competition,
that
isn't
the
only
basis
upon
which
congress
can
exercise
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
the
constitution
doesn't
say
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
competition
in
interstate
commerce.
it
says,
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
federal
state
--
among
the
several
states.
and
the
congress
seeks
to
regulate
wages
and
hours
not
merely
to
provide
a
better
basis
for
truly
fair
competition,
but
also
to
minimize
work
stoppages
from
legitimate
employee
discontent
and
also
to
increase
purchasing
power
which
will
directly
affect
the
flow
of
goods
in
commerce.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
i
suggest
that
the
succession
of
statutes
which
the
congress
passed
beginning
in
the
1930s,
not
only
fair
labor
standards
act
but
also
on
employment
insurance
and
old
age
and
survivors
insurance
has
had
an
enormous
impact
on
the
development
and
continuity
of
commerce
and
of
commerce
among
the
several
states
in
this
country.
the
strikes
in
schools
and
even
in
hospitals
are
not
unknown
even
in
this
area.
we've
cited
on
page
12
of
our
brief
an
important
study
of
strikes
by
public
employees
which
deals
among
other
things
with
the
strikes
by
public
employees
in
schools
and
hospitals.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
matter
which
is
born
in
upon
our
consciousness
over
the
past
few
weeks.
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
employees
in
public
schools
and
hospitals
who
receive
less
than
the
minimum
wage
or
work
more
than
maximum
hours
are
in
the
poverty
group
and
the
congress
might
well
feel
that
removing
a
part
of
the
economic
discrimination
against
them
which
they've
long
contended
against
could
have
an
important
bearing
on
maintaining
the
stability
of
the
free
flow
of
commerce
in
the
institutions
in
which
these
people
worked.
what
is
the
web
of
cases
which
has
been
spun
over
the
past
40
years
or
more
and
which
i
suggest
now
enmeshes
the
plaintiffs
here.
perhaps,
the
earliest
case
that
need
to
be
mentioned
is
sanitary
district
of
chicago
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1925.
this
involved
a
clearly
governmental
activity,
namely
the
disposition
of
sewage
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
had
a
direct
relation
to
the
health
of
chicago
and
of
other
parts
of
the
country.
this
court
held
that
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
regulating
that
activity
under
the
commerce
clause
was
valid
and
that
speaking
through
mr.
justice
holmes,
the
power
and
authority
of
the
united
states
to
remove
obstructions
to
interstate
foreign
commerce
was
without
question
superior
to
that
of
the
states
to
provide
for
the
welfare
or
necessities
of
their
inhabitants.
then
the
next
case
came
along,
united
states
against
california,
involving
the
san
francisco
belt
harbor
railroad
and
the
question
was
whether
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
applicable
to
such
a
railroad
conducted
by
the
state.
now
my
friends
here
of
course
seek
to
distinguish
the
case
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
proprietary
activity,
the
distinction
which
was
developed
in
the
tax
cases,
but
which
was
later
pretty
thoroughly
disposed
of,
but
in
that
case
the
court
was
very
specific.
it
said
“that
it
deemed
it
unimportant
to
say
whether
the
state
conducts
its
railroad
in
its
sovereign
or
in
its
private
capacity.”
in
whatever
capacity
the
court
said,
“the
state's
power
must
be
insubordination
to
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
which
has
been
granted
specifically
to
the
national
government.”
in
somewhat
similar
case
that
i'll
take
up
out
of
chronological
order
is
california
against
taylor
which
involved
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
the
same
railroad
and
the
court
there
said
that
the
state
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
has
subjected
itself
to
the
commerce
power
so
that
congress
can
regulate
its
employment
relationships,
now
that
of
course
gets
very
close
to
this.
a
case
which
i
think
is
of
special
importance
here
and
one
for
which
i
have
certain
nostalgic
feeling
since
i
wrote
the
brief
for
the
government
in
it,
is
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
illinois
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1933.
it
was
argued
here
by
judge
thacher
as
solicitor
general.
that
involved
the
application
of
customs
duties
to
scientific
apparatus
which
was
imported
by
the
university
of
illinois
and
i
remember
well
in
the
consideration
of
the
case
the
discussion
of
the
relative
position
of
the
taxing
power
and
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
we
deliberately
based
the
brief
in
that
case
on
the
commerce
power.
we
made
only
casual
or
incidental
reference
to
the
taxing
power.
i
would
point
out
too
that
that
case
involves
education.
this
was
the
university
of
illinois,
an
educational
institution
and
the
items
which
were
imported
were
scientific
equipment
for
use
in
the
education
enterprise.
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes,
a
very,
well
i
want
to
say
a
curt
but
a
short
opinion,
referred
to
the
commerce
power
as
an
exclusive
power
and
its
exercise
may
not
be
limited,
qualified
or
impeded
to
any
extent
by
state
action
and
he
then
went
on
to
say
the
fact
that
the
state
in
the
performance
of
state
functions
may
use
imported
articles
does
not
mean
that
the
importation
is
a
function
of
the
state
government
independent
of
federal
power.
the
control
of
importation
does
not
rest
with
the
state,
but
with
the
congress.
there
is
thus
no
violation
of
the
principle
which
the
petitioner
invokes
which
was
the
principle
of
intergovernmental
immunities
for
there
is
no
encroachment
on
the
power
of
the
state
as
none
exists
with
respect
to
the
subject
over
which
the
federal
power
has
been
exerted.
mr.
griswold
someone
may
have
to
argue
that
someday
before
--
mr.
griswold
if
there
is
no
qualification
whatever,
it
would
seem
to
go
that
far
and
if
congress
should
which
currently
i
suppose
is
unlikely
to
pass
a
statute
regulating
minimum
wages
and
overtime
for
employees
of
state
legislatures
or
of
the
state
courts,
it
would
be
possible
it
seems
to
me
to
defend
it.
it
would
be
a
harder
case
for
this
court
to
decide
on
what
this
case
is.
mr.
griswold
yes.
mr.
griswold
we've
gone
virtually
as
far
as
that
under
the
war
power
which
is
perhaps
a
somewhat
different
matter
but
--
mr.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
license
the
state
government
for
some
activities.
for
example
the
dispensing
of
narcotics
in
the
state
hospitals
i
suspect
is
done
under
federal
licensure
now
and
without
any
--
mr.
griswold
no.
governors
don't
have
a
federal
certificate
in
their
office
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
never
have
to
consider
that
question.
i
do
think
that
the
case
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
university
of
illinois
against
united
states
comes
very
close
to
this
case
when
you
get
done
to
it.
it's
easy
to
toss
it
off
and
say,
oh
it
was
a
tax.
it
wasn't
presented
on
the
basis
of
the
taxing
power.
it
wasn't
decided
on
the
bases
of
the
taxing
power.
it
was
decided
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
did
involve
education
and
it
did
sustain
the
federal
power
in
sweeping
terms.
now
the
next
one
of
these
cases
is
the
one
involving
price
control,
case
against
bowles
also
involves
education.
it
involved
the
sale
of
timber
from
lands
held
by
the
state
of
washington
for
the
support
of
public
schools
in
that
state
and
the
state
sought
to
sell
them
at
the
--
sell
the
timber
at
the
best
price
it
could
get
and
they
run
into
trouble
with
the
emergency
price
control
act
and
in
the
case
which
came
to
this
court,
the
power
of
congress
through
that
statute
to
regulate
the
prices
at
which
state
timber
could
be
sold
involving
proceeds
which
would
be
used
for
school
purposes,
that
statute
was
sustained.
and
now
finally,
we
have
a
very
recent
case,
the
significance
of
which
i
think
might
possibly
be
minimized
because
it
is
a
per
curiam
decision
and
somehow
or
rather
per
curiam
decisions
get
in
the
back
of
the
back
and
are
overlooked
unless
the
facts
aren't
stated
and
that
unless
they
are
specifically
brought
out,
they
sometimes
do
not
have
the
effect
that
case
have
decided
by
opinion
do
have.
the
case
i'm
referring
to
is
380
–
is
united
states
against
ohio
in
385
u.s.
at
page
9.
it's
not
in
the
back
of
the
back.
its
way
in
the
front
but
it's
only
two
lines
long.
united
states
against
ohio
involved
wheat
grown
on
a
state
prison
farm.
it
was
grown
by
the
state
of
ohio
without
complying
with
the
crop
restriction
provisions
of
a
federal
statute.
pursuant
to
an
opinion
of
the
state
attorney
general
that
since
it
was
a
state
and
since
under
the
constitution
of
ohio,
the
wheat
could
not
be
sold
outside
the
state
that
it
did
not
involve
commerce
and
was
not
subject
to
federal
regulation.
the
united
states
sued
to
collect
the
penalty
which
was
due
from
persons
who
operated
areas
growing
wheat
in
excess
of
their
allowance
and
the
district
court
granted
judgment
to
the
united
states
for
some
$27,000.00.
that
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
took
a
position
somewhat
like
that
presented
here
by
counsel
for
the
appellants.
they
said,
well,
this
is
such
a
little
effect
on
commerce
that
we
can't
really
suppose
that
it
ought
to
be
something
that
the
congress
could
regulate
and
they
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
in
the
summer
of
1966,
the
then
solicitor
general
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
with
this
court
to
review
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
october
of
that
year,
that
petition
was
granted
and
the
judgment
was
reversed
without
argument
here
on
the
authority
of
the
case
of
wickard
against
filburn
which
had
extended
the
--
which
had
sustained
the
extension
of
the
commerce
power
to
the
growing
of
crops.
now,
that
gets
even
closer
to
governmental
activity
it
seems
to
me
than
schools
and
hospitals.
prisons
have
long
been
a
governmental
activity
and
no
one
else
can
conduct
prisons.
it
doesn't
perhaps
go
as
far
as
legislatures
and
courts
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
suppose
however
if
the
legislature
itself
grew
some
wheat
that
this
case
would
be
applicable
to
it.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it's
very
hard
to
get
away
from
the
application
of
the
university
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
case.
there
is
one
more
case
mentioned
in
our
brief,
oklahoma
against
guy
f.
atkinson
company
where
it
was
contended
that
the
federal
government
have
no
power
to
build
a
dam
because
some
of
the
lands
which
would
be
affected
would
be
state
lands
and
this
was
important
not
merely
from
the
proprietary
point
of
view
but
also
from
the
governmental
point
of
view
because
it
would
interfere
with
the
state
taxing
power
and
among
other
things
in
some
way
would
obliterate
the
boundary
of
the
state,
but
the
court
had
no
difficulty
there
in
sustaining
the
power
of
congress
to
authorize
the
building
of
the
dam
under
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
a
number
of
other
cases
are
discussed
in
our
brief
and
even
more
in
the
brief
for
the
appellant
states.
they
seem
to
me
to
show
that
the
time
has
passed
when
the
argument
which
counsel
for
the
appellants
are
making
here
can
be
a
successfully
made.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
regulation
of
commerce
whether
it
is
one
which
should
be
made,
was
one
for
the
judgment
of
congress
and
congress
has
made
that
judgment
of
the
fact
that
states
are
affected
at
least
in
these
operations
is
not
sufficient
to
eliminate
the
power
of
congress
over
commerce
and
accordingly
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
