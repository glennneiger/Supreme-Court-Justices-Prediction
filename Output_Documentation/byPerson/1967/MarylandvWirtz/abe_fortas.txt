justice
abe
fortas
was
an
amendment
to
take
care
of
that
submitted
to
the
congress,
considered
by
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
the
problem
of
the
overtime
provisions
is
applicable
to
this
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
not
arguing
that
the
burden
per
se
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
affects
constitutional
question,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
your
complaint
be
the
same
if
the
congress
had
merely
said
that
they
have
to
pay
state
hospital
employees
a
dollar
an
hour?
would
you
still
be
here?
would
your
constitutional
question
be
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
second
point
--
suppose
that
it
is
commerce,
would
you
be
here
arguing
your
second
point
that
is
to
say
that
the
regulation
would
be
an
unconstitutional
interference
with
state
functions?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
really
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
at
the
moment
of
the
essence
that
to
say
whether
you
concede
in
effect
that
the
federal
government
has
power
assuming
the
commerce
point
now
so
you
could
concede
that
the
federal
government
has
power
or
arguing
here
it
exercise
that
power
in
a
way
so
destructive
as
to
constitute
an
infringement
of
state's
rights
under
the
constitution
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
you're
arguing
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
power
to
fix
minimum
wages
etcetera
for
employees
of
state
hospitals
etcetera?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
like
you
to
do
--
are
you
saying
that
the
hospital
workers
engage
in
what
used
to
be
called
a
purely
governmental
function.
you're
not
saying
that,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
--
are
you
then
saying
that
the
impact
of
these
particular
regulations
on
otherwise
regulable
state
function
is
so
severe
as
to
make
the
federal
activity
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
state
--
state
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why?
i'm
trying
to
get
why,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
impact
is
so
heavy?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
applied
the
wage
now
regulations
people
engaged
in
the
bottling
of
water,
i
think
that's
bottling
of
spring
water
state
enterprise.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
whether
it's
tax
or
not.
suppose
you
applied
the
wage
an
hour
regulations
to
that,
it
would
have
the
same
effect
in
theory
--
in
principle
although
quantitatively
different,
the
point
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
you're
objecting
here
because
of
the
quantitative
impact.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
arguing
--
professor
wright,
are
you
arguing
that
the
wage
and
hour
act
cannot
apply
to
husbands?
are
you
arguing
that
generally
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
of
the
limitations
of
the
commerce
clause?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
retail
stores?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
laboratories,
medical
laboratories?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
--
i
thought
you're
arguing
generally
that
hospitals
are
outside
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
whether
the
people
pay
for
it
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
only
state
hospitals
and
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
will
you
tell
me
what
the
distinction
is
that
you
make
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
between
state
hospitals
and
private
hospitals?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
as
a
practical
matter?
most
state
hospital's
patient
does
pay
anyway,
doesn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
you
say
that
because
--
well,
let's
assume
that
nobody
pays,
you
say
that
has
an
effect
on
commerce
clause?
is
there
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
any
case
on
that?
any
authority
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
understand
you
professor
wright,
if
you
have
a
hospital
that
is
under
the
private
management,
that
hospital
would
be
in
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
under
state
ownership,
state
operation,
it
is
not.
the
commerce
clause
stops
on
account
of
the
nature
of
the
ownership.
am
i
wrong
in
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
that's
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
help
me
very
much.
let's
take
exactly
this
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is,
what
the
basis
of
your
position
is.
in
this
case,
are
you
arguing
that
hospitals
and
this
goes
back
to
what
i
asked
you
before,
are
you
arguing
that
hospitals
are
outside
of
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause?
or
are
you
arguing
that
an
identical
hospital
which
under
the
--
which
under
the
private
ownership
and
management
would
be
within
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause
and
by
virtue
of
the
state
ownership,
management
and
operation
that
comes
outside
--
is
outside
of
the
reach
of
the
commerce
clause?
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
stop
right
there
if
you
will
and
take
that
exact
hospital.
under
the
private
management
and
ownership
where
everybody
is
charged
$50.00
a
day
for
a
room,
would
it
then
be
within
the
commerce
clause?
we're
talking
about
a
hospital
and
i
don't
have
to
quarrel
about
what
a
hospital
does.
let's
assume
that
we
are
in
agreement
in
what
a
hospital
does
and
how
it
operates.
i
ask
you
that
precise
question
because
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
answer
to
that
is
essential
if
i
am
to
understand
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
it
must
be
your
position
professor
wright
that
the
wages
paid
to
people
per
se
will
not
affect
interstate
commerce
and
now
let's
suppose
you
had
a
monopoly,
pure
monopoly
to
then
compete
with
anybody,
just
assume
that
with
me
if
you
will,
and
it's
general
activities
are
such
to
bring
it
within
the
interstate
commerce
category
but
that
doesn't
compete
with
anybody.
the
federal
government
regulates
wages.
there's
a
fact
that
there
is
no
competitive
factor
there
excluded
from
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power.
justice
abe
fortas
was
an
amendment
to
take
care
of
that

the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
the
problem
of
the

is
applicable
to

justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
not
arguing
that
the

constitutional

are
you?
justice
abe
