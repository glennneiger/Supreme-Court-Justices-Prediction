mr.
alan
m.
wilner
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
asks
whether
the
1966
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
i
shall
refer
to
hereafter
as
public
law
89601
are
constitutional.
specifically,
it
asks
whether
or
not
congress
can
extend
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
state
and
local
school
and
hospital
employees.
now
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
statutory
question
of
whether
the
states
or
the
ultimate
consumers
of
the
goods
which
they
purchase
in
commerce,
we
view
this
case
as
involving
two
essential
issues.
we
do
not
of
course
mean
to
abandon
either
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
statutory
construction
argument,
but
we
would
prefer
to
rest
upon
our
brief
as
to
those
arguments.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
activity
being
regulated
has
a
sufficiently
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
to
be
constitutionally
regulable
by
congress.
now,
this
does
not
involve
any
consideration
of
whether
the
commerce
clause
is
plenary
or
exclusive
or
just
how
powerful
it
is.
it
does
not
involve
the
tenth
amendment.
the
only
consideration
here
is
whether
the
activity
is
or
affects
commerce
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
regulable
per
se.
the
second
issue
is
if
the
court
in
examining
the
activities
under
consideration,
determines
that
they
are
or
substantially
affect
commerce,
it
must
then
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
commerce
power.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
question
of
whether
our
federal
system
itself
is
an
implied
limitation
on
the
commerce
power
comes
into
play.
now
there
are
as
the
court
may
know,
28
states
who
are
appellants
here,
obviously
more
than
one
point
of
view
has
been
expressed.
professor
wright
my
co-counsel
in
his
brief
has
addressed
himself
primarily
to
the
first
issue
and
he
will
argue
that
today.
accordingly,
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
second
issue
that
is
whether
assuming
that
the
activities
affect
commerce
or
our
commerce
the
fact
that
they
are
carried
on
by
states
under
the
circumstances
present
here
precludes
congress
from
regulating
them
in
a
way
that
it
is
sought
to
do.
now
we
assert
initially
as
our
basis,
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
case
of
texas
versus
white
that
the
preservation
of
the
states
and
the
maintenance
of
their
governments
is
as
much
within
the
design
and
care
of
the
constitution
as
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
maintenance
of
the
national
government.
we
start
with
that
as
our
premise.
less
it'd
be
said
that
this
is
a
passé,
no
longer
good
law,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
very
language
and
this
very
context
was
cited
with
approval
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
only
eight
years
ago
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
united
states
versus
florida,
reported
at
363
u.s.
121
his
particular
language
at
132.
the
secretary
of
labor
asserts
that
this
is
no
consideration
in
ascertaining
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power
and
for
that,
he
relies
on
language
of
this
court
in
the
cases
of
united
states
versus
california,
297
u.s.,
case
versus
bowles,
reported
at
327
u.s.
and
board
of
trustees
versus
united
states
reported
at
289
u.s.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
actual
decisions
in
these
cases
are
not
controlling
here
that
the
degree
of
federal
intrusion
upon
the
states
is
entirely
different
and
so
are
its
effects
and
we
urge
that
the
court
reconsider
the
dicta
and
we
submit
and
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
that's
all
that
it
was
that
the
court
reconsider
the
dicta
in
those
cases
in
the
light
of
the
facts
involved
here
and
because
this
is
central
to
our
argument,
i
would
like
to
develop
this
in
some
depth
now.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
from
almost
the
very
beginning,
there
had
been
an
implied
limitation
upon
the
national
taxing
power
where
state
governmental
activities
were
concerned
and
until
the
case
of
united
states
versus
california,
there
had
been
no
occasion
to
conclude
that
the
commerce
power
was
not
subject
to
the
same
limitation.
at
least,
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
california
case
where
the
distinction,
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
determine
was
for
the
first
time
made,
the
court
cited
no
previous
authority
for
making
the
distinction
between
the
taxing
and
commerce
power
and
i
refer
to
the
court
to
297
u.s.
at
page
185
where
this
distinction
was
first
made.
in
california
of
course,
the
question
was
whether
the
state
owned
belt
railway
was
subject
to
the
safety
appliance
act.
california
argued
that
the
railroad
was
owned
and
operated
as
a
sovereign
function
of
the
state,
relying
on
the
doctrine
of
immunity
which
had
been
evolved
from
the
tax
cases.
now
the
court
never
stopped
to
analyze
even,
whether
even
under
the
taxing
doctrine,
that
is
with
the
limitations
imposed
upon
the
taxing
power,
the
railroad
would
be
immune.
but
instead
asserted,
i
submit
quite
unnecessarily,
that
the
limitations
applicable
to
the
taxing
power
were
not
applicable
to
the
commerce
power
and
on
that
basis,
the
railroad
could
be
regulated.
now,
i
say
that
the
distinction
raised
in
that
case
was
unnecessary
because
the
facts
will
demonstrate
that
the
railroad
was
not
only
regulable
under
the
commerce
power,
but
also
taxable
under
the
taxing
power.
in
the
later
case,
in
the
state
of
california
versus
anglim
decided
some
seven
years
after
the
california
case
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
same
belt
railroad
was
not
immune
from
the
federal
carrier's
tax
of
1937.
i
might
mention
that
perhaps
the
chief
justice
may
have
some
special
recollection
of
that
case
having
come
up
under
his
tenure
as
attorney
general
of
california.
the
district
court
in
the
anglim
case
expressly
held
that
the
railroad
was
not
an
essentially
and
traditionally
governmental
function
and
for
that
reason
was
taxable.
this
decision
is
reported
at
37
fed
supp
at
page
667.
the
circuit
court
agreed
entirely
with
the
lower
court's
approach
reporting
its
decision
at
129
f2nd
460.
the
circuit
court
also
went
on
the
theory
that
the
taxing
act
was
a
commerce
regulation,
but
it
expressly
agreed
with
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
as
a
factual
matter,
it
was
--
the
railroad
was
also
taxable
under
the
taxing
power.
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
317
u.s.
669
and
in
fact
i
think
had
implicitly
accepted
the
circuit
and
district
court
approaches
in
the
earlier
case
of
california
versus
latimer
at
305
u.s.
255
where
it
sustained
a
different
aspect
of
the
carrier's
tax
of
1937
against
the
very
same
belt
railroad.
thus,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
distinction
raised
in
the
first
california
case
with
respect
to
the
very
activity
which
was
there
under
consideration
amounted
to
unnecessary
dicta.
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
whether
the
taxing
power
or
the
commerce
power
was
involved.
the
railroad
was
not
an
essentially
--
an
essential
governmental
function
and
that
is
why
it
could
be
regulated
and
taxed.
now
the
idea
that
the
taxing
power
is
somehow
less
potent
or
somehow
more
limited
than
the
commerce
power
it
was
not
supported
by
precedent
and
in
fact
was
rejected
later
by
this
court.
as
a
general
proposition,
the
taxing
power
has
been
described
many
times
by
this
court
in
the
same
broad
way
as
it
has
described
the
commerce
power.
in
tanner
versus
little
for
example,
an
early
case
reported
the
240
u.s.
369,
the
court
said
that
the
power
of
taxation
is
as
extensive
as
the
range
of
subjects
over
which
the
government
extends.
it
is
absolute
and
unlimited
in
the
absence
of
constitutional
limitations
and
restraints
and
carries
with
it
the
power
to
embarrass
and
destroy.
not
only
has
a
taxing
power
been
described
in
this
very
broad
way
on
its
own
but
it
has
also
been
equated
with
the
other
plenary
enumerated
powers.
in
the
case
of
ashton
versus
cameron
county
for
example,
reported
at
298
u.s.
513,
which
i
might
add
was
decided
after
the
california
case,
the
court
equated
the
tax
and
the
bankruptcy
powers
stating
“both
powers
are
granted
by
the
same
section
of
the
constitution
and
we
can
find
no
reason
for
saying
that
one
is
implied
limited
by
the
necessity
of
preserving
independence
of
the
states
while
the
other
is
not.”
even
more
specifically
to
the
point,
“the
court
in
the
same
case
stated
at
page
532
that
for
a
very
long
time,
this
court
has
steadfastly
adhered
to
the
doctrine
that
the
taxing
power
of
congress
does
not
extend
to
the
states
where
there
are
political
subdivisions.
the
same
basic
reasoning
which
leads
to
that
conclusion
we
think,
requires
like
limitation
upon
the
power
which
springs
from
the
bankruptcy
clause.”
later,
in
the
case
of
new
york
versus
united
states,
the
famous
tax
case
with
the
mineral
waters
justice
frankfurter
referring
to
the
california
case
stated,
“that
surely
the
power
of
congress
to
lay
taxes
has
impliedly
no
lesser
reach
in
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce.”
now,
it
serves
no
real
purpose
i
think
to
bounce
cases
back
off
against
one
another.
what
we
must
do
now
is
look
to
the
basic
underlying
legal
concepts
which
are
involved.
now
in
california,
the
court
assumed
that
the
reason
for
the
limitation
on
the
taxing
power
was
to
enable
each
government
to
tax
freely.
this
is
what
it
said.
in
the
earlier
case
of
metcalf
versus
mitchell
however,
the
court
stated
the
rationale
in
this
words,
“but
neither
government
may
destroy
the
other
nor
curtail
in
any
substantial
manner
the
exercise
of
its
powers.”
now,
this
i
submit
is
a
far
broader
basis
for
the
limitation
than
that
which
was
expressed
in
the
california
case
and
i
think
it
strikes
more
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
it
is
also
the
approach
which
was
adopted
by
all
eight
justices
in
the
case
of
new
york
versus
united
states.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
the
new
york
case
that
“the
fact
that
ours
is
a
federal
constitutional
system
as
expressly
recognized
in
the
tenth
amendment
carries
with
it
implications
regarding
the
taxing
power
as
in
other
aspects
of
government,”
citing
his
authority,
hopkins
federal
versus
cleary,
which
of
course
involved
a
limitation
on
the
commerce
and
banking
powers.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
anglim
cases,
the
california
belt
railroad
tax
cases
as
a
result
of
ashton
versus
cameron
and
of
new
york
versus
united
states
and
as
a
result
of
the
other
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
which
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
go
into
at
this
stage,
it
would
appear
that
the
distinction
which
was
raised
in
the
first
california
case
was
inappropriate
and
no
longer
recognized,
but
then
it
was
repeated
in
the
case
of
case
versus
bowles
reported
at
327
u.s.
92.
now,
in
case
versus
bowles,
the
court
rejected
the
distinction
between
essential
and
nonessential
state
functions
with
respect
to
the
war
power
because
it
appeared
to
be
unworkable.
this
is
what
the
court
said,
citing
the
new
york
tax
case
in
which
the
court
was
unable
to
arrive
at
any
agreement
as
to
where
the
balance
would
be
struck.
based
upon
the
new
york
case,
the
court
just
said,
--
simply
said,
it
seemed
to
me
that
“we
can't
work
out
any
kind
of
balance
therefore
there
isn't
any.”
now,
in
that
case,
the
question
was
whether
the
power
of
the
state
of
washington
to
sell
timber
to
the
highest
bider
was
subordinate
to
the
opa
ceiling
price
regulations
which
had
been
issued
pursuant
to
the
war
power.
in
that
context,
the
essential
and
nonessential
distinction
which
had
been
raised
as
a
test
by
some
of
the
justices
in
the
new
york
tax
case
which
had
been
accepted
before
in
tax
cases
may
well
had
been
unworkable
and
maybe
that
distinction
is
unworkable
here.
but
even
that
would
not
mean
that
no
limitation
is
to
be
implied
because
i
submit
that
theory
itself
would
be
unworkable.
to
demonstrate
this,
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
what
public
law
89601
actually
does.
now
in
the
middle
of
a
fiscal
year
that
is
after
state
budgets
had
already
been
enacted,
after
the
next
necessary
taxes
had
been
levy,
along
comes
congress
and
raises
the
pay
of
state
employees.
now
we
stipulated
below
and
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
cost
of
this
to
the
state
just
the
monetary
cost
alone
would
be
enormous,
perhaps
$100
million
to
$200
million
annually,
whether
it's
200
or
100
we
submit
as
terribly
significant,
but
it
would
be
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
for
the
first
year
of
operation.
of
course
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
this
is
--
let
me
clear
this
up
now
mr.
justice
white
in
contrast
to
the
impression
sought
to
be
conveyed
of
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
unions.
the
problem
here
is
not
with
the
minimum
wage.
the
instances
of
sub-minimal
wages
among
the
state
employees
is
rather
limited
and
this
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
this
is
primarily
overtime.
what
this
act
does
essentially
without
getting
into
the
statutory
problems
of
it,
is
to
eliminate
the
device
of
compensatory
time
which
all
levels
of
government
have
used
for
many
years.
that
is
if
an
employee
works,
if
the
wage,
if
the
hourly
thing
is
40
hours
and
an
employee
works
44
hours
in
one
week,
he
would
be
given
four
hours
off
at
some
other
time
and
he
could
accumulate
these
extra
hours
so
he
could
take
a
whole
day
off
and
this
worked
well
in
both
the
federal
and
the
state
systems.
the
effect
of
this
act
is
that
unless
the
compensatory
time
can
be
given
within
the
same
pay
period,
the
state
can
no
longer
use
it.
it
must
pay
a
premium
overtime
and
it
is
this
of
course
which
applies
not
only
to
people
making
a
dollar
an
hour
but
people
to
making
$10.00
an
hour
as
well
and
it's
this
which
affects
the
primary
--
the
major
cost
burden
because
we
stipulated
below
and
the
record
will
show
that
in
many
instances,
it's
just
impossible
for
state
governments
to
compensate
their
people
within
the
same
pay
period.
i
think
the
very
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
with
these
disturbances
in
the
city
will
demonstrate
with
all
of
the
overtime
that
had
to
be
paid
under
this
act
if
it
were
applicable
to
those
people
and
the
constitutional
question
would
be
that
it
could
be
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
to
take
care
of
what
sir?
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no.
this
is
what
--
it
is
so
particularly
distressing
about
the
whole
affair.
this
act
was
passed
without
any
consideration
being
given
to
it.
the
public
school
people
were
put
under
without
any
debate
on
the
house
floor.
it
was
passed
in
conference
committee.
well,
let
me
backtrack.
the
house
labor
committee
which
originally
had
this
excluded
public
school
people.
on
the
floor
of
the
house
without
any
debate
somebody
proposed
an
amendment
to
include
some
900,000
public
school
people
and
it
was
passed
that
way.
the
senate
labor
committee
after
the
house
action
excluded
to
public
school
people
saying
that
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
burden
of
this
on
the
states.
yet
and
the
senate
passed
it
that
way
and
in
conference
committee,
the
house
version
was
the
one
which
resulted
without
any
conference
committee
report
indicating
why.
to
my
knowledge,
no
state
agency
or
affected
agency
was
ever
notified
of
the
bill
or
asked
to
appear
to
explain.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
any
consideration
was
given
either
to
the
constitutional
aspects
of
it
or
to
the
economic
burden
upon
the
states.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
saying
that
it's
an
important
part
of
it
in
the
whole
flavoring
of
this,
but
it's
–
i
am
not
resting
on
the
fact
that
the
additional
cost
alone
is
sufficient.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no
sir.
it
only
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
it
excluded
professional
and
administrative
people.
it's
in
its
minimum
wage
of
this
i
think
perhaps
the
overtime
too.
it's
directed
at
the
lower
paid
people
but
as
i
say
with
respect
to
state
employment
there
had
been
no
evidence
of
any
more
than
minimum
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes
sir.
constitutionally,
we
submit
that
if
the
only
task
is
whether
these
schools
and
hospitals
buy
goods
in
commerce,
we
stipulated
that
the
governor's
office
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
the
governor's
office
by
things
in
commerce
too.
they
can
tell
the
governor
how
much
he's
got
to
make
and
how
much
the
legislators
have
to
be
paid
and
how
long
they
have
to
sit.
i
mean
to
test
--
the
government
claims
this
is
conjuring
up
horribles,
but
we
submit
that
this
is
isn't
conjuring
up
horribles
at
all.
this
is
the
constitutional
power
we're
talking
about.
in
any
event,
the
act
takes
effect
in
the
middle
of
a
fiscal
year
after
all
of
these
budgets
are
set.
now,
we
agree
that
there
are
only
two
ways
of
complying
with
this
act.
either
we
cut
back
programs
in
the
middle
of
the
year
and
thereby
divert
funds
which
were
specifically
appropriated
by
legislatures
for
specific
purposes
to
other
purposes
or
we
call
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
to
levy
new
taxes
to
increase
appropriations
in
order
to
meet
the
act
or
in
some
cases
i
might
add
assemble
a
state
constitutional
convention
in
order
to
increase
taxable
limits
which
were
set
by
state
constitutions.
now
this
goes
as
i
submit
to
the
court
way
beyond
some
incidental
regulation
of
schools
and
hospitals.
this
requires
bypassing
of
the
most
basic
and
fundamental
attribute
of
state
government
and
that
is
the
power
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
state
government
itself.
the
power
of
state
government
to
decide
how
much
taxes
to
levy,
how
to
distribute
the
revenue
among
various
state
programs
and
no
where
in
his
brief
does
the
secretary
of
labor
comment
on
this.
i
think
he
casted
off
under
some
of
these
cases
as
unimportant,
but
we
submit
it's
not
unimportant.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
we
would
still
be
here
because
there
is
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
this
is
even
commerce
in
the
sense
of
the
constitution.
i
think
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
it
would,
but
i
must
confess
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it
maybe
less
so,
but
i
think
it
still
presents
a
very
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
my
argument
is
this
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
act
in
question
does.
now,
i
think
in
doing
that,
it's
hard
to
make
these
fine
distinctions;
hospital
is
okay,
schools
maybe
not.
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
the
act
itself
and
what
it
does
and
if
it
so
substantially
interferes
with
state
government
then
it's
bad.
if
it
doesn't
then
it's
alright.
we
don't
dispute
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
or
that
certain
state
functions
are
so
regulable.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
california
case.
if
we
were
running
a
state
railroad
or
selling
mineral
waters
or
something
like
that,
there'd
no
question
that
they
could
regulate
this
kind
of
activity.
in
fact,
it's
so
done.
the
second
california
case
applied
the
railway
labor
act
to
the
belt
railway
and
we
have
no
qualms
with
that.
i
think
it's
more
of
a
balancing
approach
and
i
would
like
to
expand
on
that.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no
sir.
i'm
not
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
i
would
accept
that,
but
i
would
like
to
paraphrase
it
if
i
may.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
--
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
whether
the
congress
can
regulate
state
hospitals
or
state
schools,
but
simply
whether
the
regulation
doesn't
go
beyond
that
and
more
substantially
affect
state
government
in
itself
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
because
in
this
instance
with
respect
to
this
particular
act,
it
does
a
way
entirely
with
the
concept
of
state
legislatures
determining
what
taxes
to
levy,
where
to
appropriate
the
money,
what
the
scope
--
is
going
to
be.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
not
just
because
of
the
financial
impact,
but
simply,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
increase
the
total
cost,
$100
million
or
$10,000.
the
point
is
that
this
is
where
you
disrupt
the
entire
budgetary
system
by
making
the
states
to
pay
their
own
employees
more
than
they
have
appropriated
money
to
do.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
that
was
taxed.
that
wasn't
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
i
think
it's
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
are
activities
which
had
been
so
regulated
of
an
income
producing
situation.
it's
the
running
of
a
railroad
or
the
selling
of
mineral
water
doesn't
involve
the
same
kind
of
situation
where
you've
got
to
get
your
money
solely
from
the
state
legislature.
if
your
employees
have
to
be
paid
more
then
you
hike
the
price
of
your
freight
tariff
or
you
raises
the
price
of
your
mineral
waters
to
do
it.
this
is
--
the
states
aren't
quite
put
in
quite
the
same
position.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
these
activities.
now,
i
will
submit
that
there
is
no
rationale
analogy
between
this
type
of
control
and
regulation
that
we're
involved
in
here
and
regulations
concerning
the
growing
of
wheat
or
the
operation
of
railroad
or
dock
facilities
or
even
a
sewage
system.
this
strikes
i
think
more
at
the
very
heart
of
the
state
government.
now,
i
think
that
the
court
below
agreed
that
this
was
a
case
of
first
impression
where
the
invasion
of
federal
power
is
the
greatest
and
i
think
that
this
court
must
review
those
cases,
the
dicta
which
are
relied
on
and
determine
where
this
line
is
to
be
drawn.
i
think
in
judging
the
different
approaches,
it
seems
rather
irrelevant
to
consider
whether
one
power
is
exclusive
and
another
concurrent.
i
think
these
are
clichés
that
don't
really
describe
the
total
quantum
of
the
power.
what
we
must
look
to
is
why
is
there
a
limitation
at
all.
now
in
the
tax
cases
it's
because
it
was
early
recognize
that
if
the
federal
government
could
tax
the
sovereign
governmental
functions
or
the
activities
of
the
state,
it
could
destroy
the
state
as
in
effect
of
political
entity.
now
we
are
submitting
to
the
court
how
is
this
commerce
power
any
different
when
it
is
used
this
way
when
they
tell
the
states
how
much
taxes
to
levy,
how
to
appropriate
tax
derived
revenues.
we
submit
that
there's
no
logical
distinction
between
these
two
powers.
the
rationale
for
limiting
the
scope
of
one
is
the
rationale
for
limiting
the
scope
of
the
other.
now,
if
this
approach
is
adopted,
if
the
tax
limitations
are
implied
on
the
commerce
power,
we
don't
consider
that
it
would
be
terribly
unworkable
at
all.
it
would
only
mean
that
this
court
will
act
to
--
view
acts
of
congress
in
the
light
of
whether
they
seriously
intrude
upon
basic
functions
of
state
government
and
you
don't
need
clichés
like
essential
or
governmental
or
sovereign
to
do
this.
you
don't
need
a
mathematical
formula.
so
many
of
the
justices
have
said
in
the
past,
it's
a
delicate
balancing
process.
it's
not
an
easy
one,
but
we
submit
it's
a
necessary
one.
what
you've
got
to
do
is
to
examine
this
act,
look
at
what
it
does
and
determine
whether
it's
so
interferes
with
states
as
states
that
exceeds
the
national
power.
this
will
have
to
be
done
i
submit
on
a
case
by
case
basis
looking
at
each
act
individually.
out
of
this
perhaps
will
involve
some
guidelines
but
this
need
not
be
made
explicit
now.
all
that
is
required
now
is
to
recognize
that
federalism
is
an
implied
limitation
on
federal
power
and
to
decide
on
whatever
test
is
adopted
if
you
accept
the
limitation
that
this
act,
public
law
89601
exceeds
that
limitation
and
is
therefore
void.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
about
$4.5
million
--
well,
it's
about
$2.5
million
directly
the
first
year
of
operation
all
in
overtime.
in
addition
to
that
under
maryland
law,
all
employees
must
be
treated
the
same.
we
can't
discriminate
from
those
who
are
under
the
federal
act
and
those
who
are
not.
so
the
additional
cost
to
the
state
of
treating
the
non-covered
employees
would
be
almost
another
$2
million.
i
think
the
stipulated
fact
which
shows
about
$4
million
to
$4.5
million
the
first
year
and
of
course
as
the
minimum
wage
goes
up
each
year,
this
will
become
more
and
more
expensive
both
in
the
minimum
wage
terms
as
well
as
the
overtime.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
thank
you
sir.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
asks
whether
the
1966
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
i
shall
refer
to
hereafter
as
public
law
89601
are
constitutional.
specifically,
it
asks
whether
or
not
congress
can
extend
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
state
and
local
school
and
hospital
employees.
now
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
statutory
question
of
whether
the
states
or
the
ultimate
consumers
of
the
goods
which
they
purchase
in
commerce,
we
view
this
case
as
involving
two
essential
issues.
we
do
not
of
course
mean
to
abandon
either
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
statutory
construction
argument,
but
we
would
prefer
to
rest
upon
our
brief
as
to
those
arguments.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
activity
being
regulated
has
a
sufficiently
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
to
be
constitutionally
regulable
by
congress.
now,
this
does
not
involve
any
consideration
of
whether
the
commerce
clause
is
plenary
or
exclusive
or
just
how
powerful
it
is.
it
does
not
involve
the
tenth
amendment.
the
only
consideration
here
is
whether
the
activity
is
or
affects
commerce
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
regulable
per
se.
the
second
issue
is
if
the
court
in
examining
the
activities
under
consideration,
determines
that
they
are
or
substantially
affect
commerce,
it
must
then
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
commerce
power.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
question
of
whether
our
federal
system
itself
is
an
implied
limitation
on
the
commerce
power
comes
into
play.
now
there
are
as
the
court
may
know,
28
states
who
are
appellants
here,
obviously
more
than
one
point
of
view
has
been
expressed.
professor
wright
my
co-counsel
in
his
brief
has
addressed
himself
primarily
to
the
first
issue
and
he
will
argue
that
today.
accordingly,
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
second
issue
that
is
whether
assuming
that
the
activities
affect
commerce
or
our
commerce
the
fact
that
they
are
carried
on
by
states
under
the
circumstances
present
here
precludes
congress
from
regulating
them
in
a
way
that
it
is
sought
to
do.
now
we
assert
initially
as
our
basis,
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
case
of
texas
versus
white
that
the
preservation
of
the
states
and
the
maintenance
of
their
governments
is
as
much
within
the
design
and
care
of
the
constitution
as
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
maintenance
of
the
national
government.
we
start
with
that
as
our
premise.
less
it'd
be
said
that
this
is
a
passé,
no
longer
good
law,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
very
language
and
this
very
context
was
cited
with
approval
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
only
eight
years
ago
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
united
states
versus
florida,
reported
at
363
u.s.
121
his
particular
language
at
132.
the
secretary
of
labor
asserts
that
this
is
no
consideration
in
ascertaining
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power
and
for
that,
he
relies
on
language
of
this
court
in
the
cases
of
united
states
versus
california,
297
u.s.,
case
versus
bowles,
reported
at
327
u.s.
and
board
of
trustees
versus
united
states
reported
at
289
u.s.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
actual
decisions
in
these
cases
are
not
controlling
here
that
the
degree
of
federal
intrusion
upon
the
states
is
entirely
different
and
so
are
its
effects
and
we
urge
that
the
court
reconsider
the
dicta
and
we
submit
and
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
that's
all
that
it
was
that
the
court
reconsider
the
dicta
in
those
cases
in
the
light
of
the
facts
involved
here
and
because
this
is
central
to
our
argument,
i
would
like
to
develop
this
in
some
depth
now.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
from
almost
the
very
beginning,
there
had
been
an
implied
limitation
upon
the
national
taxing
power
where
state
governmental
activities
were
concerned
and
until
the
case
of
united
states
versus
california,
there
had
been
no
occasion
to
conclude
that
the
commerce
power
was
not
subject
to
the
same
limitation.
at
least,
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
california
case
where
the
distinction,
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
determine
was
for
the
first
time
made,
the
court
cited
no
previous
authority
for
making
the
distinction
between
the
taxing
and
commerce
power
and
i
refer
to
the
court
to
297
u.s.
at
page
185
where
this
distinction
was
first
made.
in
california
of
course,
the
question
was
whether
the
state
owned
belt
railway
was
subject
to
the
safety
appliance
act.
california
argued
that
the
railroad
was
owned
and
operated
as
a
sovereign
function
of
the
state,
relying
on
the
doctrine
of
immunity
which
had
been
evolved
from
the
tax
cases.
now
the
court
never
stopped
to
analyze
even,
whether
even
under
the
taxing
doctrine,
that
is
with
the
limitations
imposed
upon
the
taxing
power,
the
railroad
would
be
immune.
but
instead
asserted,
i
submit
quite
unnecessarily,
that
the
limitations
applicable
to
the
taxing
power
were
not
applicable
to
the
commerce
power
and
on
that
basis,
the
railroad
could
be
regulated.
now,
i
say
that
the
distinction
raised
in
that
case
was
unnecessary
because
the
facts
will
demonstrate
that
the
railroad
was
not
only
regulable
under
the
commerce
power,
but
also
taxable
under
the
taxing
power.
in
the
later
case,
in
the
state
of
california
versus
anglim
decided
some
seven
years
after
the
california
case
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
same
belt
railroad
was
not
immune
from
the
federal
carrier's
tax
of
1937.
i
might
mention
that
perhaps
the
chief
justice
may
have
some
special
recollection
of
that
case
having
come
up
under
his
tenure
as
attorney
general
of
california.
the
district
court
in
the
anglim
case
expressly
held
that
the
railroad
was
not
an
essentially
and
traditionally
governmental
function
and
for
that
reason
was
taxable.
this
decision
is
reported
at
37
fed
supp
at
page
667.
the
circuit
court
agreed
entirely
with
the
lower
court's
approach
reporting
its
decision
at
129
f2nd
460.
the
circuit
court
also
went
on
the
theory
that
the
taxing
act
was
a
commerce
regulation,
but
it
expressly
agreed
with
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
as
a
factual
matter,
it
was
--
the
railroad
was
also
taxable
under
the
taxing
power.
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
317
u.s.
669
and
in
fact
i
think
had
implicitly
accepted
the
circuit
and
district
court
approaches
in
the
earlier
case
of
california
versus
latimer
at
305
u.s.
255
where
it
sustained
a
different
aspect
of
the
carrier's
tax
of
1937
against
the
very
same
belt
railroad.
thus,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
distinction
raised
in
the
first
california
case
with
respect
to
the
very
activity
which
was
there
under
consideration
amounted
to
unnecessary
dicta.
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
whether
the
taxing
power
or
the
commerce
power
was
involved.
the
railroad
was
not
an
essentially
--
an
essential
governmental
function
and
that
is
why
it
could
be
regulated
and
taxed.
now
the
idea
that
the
taxing
power
is
somehow
less
potent
or
somehow
more
limited
than
the
commerce
power
it
was
not
supported
by
precedent
and
in
fact
was
rejected
later
by
this
court.
as
a
general
proposition,
the
taxing
power
has
been
described
many
times
by
this
court
in
the
same
broad
way
as
it
has
described
the
commerce
power.
in
tanner
versus
little
for
example,
an
early
case
reported
the
240
u.s.
369,
the
court
said
that
the
power
of
taxation
is
as
extensive
as
the
range
of
subjects
over
which
the
government
extends.
it
is
absolute
and
unlimited
in
the
absence
of
constitutional
limitations
and
restraints
and
carries
with
it
the
power
to
embarrass
and
destroy.
not
only
has
a
taxing
power
been
described
in
this
very
broad
way
on
its
own
but
it
has
also
been
equated
with
the
other
plenary
enumerated
powers.
in
the
case
of
ashton
versus
cameron
county
for
example,
reported
at
298
u.s.
513,
which
i
might
add
was
decided
after
the
california
case,
the
court
equated
the
tax
and
the
bankruptcy
powers
stating
“both
powers
are
granted
by
the
same
section
of
the
constitution
and
we
can
find
no
reason
for
saying
that
one
is
implied
limited
by
the
necessity
of
preserving
independence
of
the
states
while
the
other
is
not.”
even
more
specifically
to
the
point,
“the
court
in
the
same
case
stated
at
page
532
that
for
a
very
long
time,
this
court
has
steadfastly
adhered
to
the
doctrine
that
the
taxing
power
of
congress
does
not
extend
to
the
states
where
there
are
political
subdivisions.
the
same
basic
reasoning
which
leads
to
that
conclusion
we
think,
requires
like
limitation
upon
the
power
which
springs
from
the
bankruptcy
clause.”
later,
in
the
case
of
new
york
versus
united
states,
the
famous
tax
case
with
the
mineral
waters
justice
frankfurter
referring
to
the
california
case
stated,
“that
surely
the
power
of
congress
to
lay
taxes
has
impliedly
no
lesser
reach
in
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce.”
now,
it
serves
no
real
purpose
i
think
to
bounce
cases
back
off
against
one
another.
what
we
must
do
now
is
look
to
the
basic
underlying
legal
concepts
which
are
involved.
now
in
california,
the
court
assumed
that
the
reason
for
the
limitation
on
the
taxing
power
was
to
enable
each
government
to
tax
freely.
this
is
what
it
said.
in
the
earlier
case
of
metcalf
versus
mitchell
however,
the
court
stated
the
rationale
in
this
words,
“but
neither
government
may
destroy
the
other
nor
curtail
in
any
substantial
manner
the
exercise
of
its
powers.”
now,
this
i
submit
is
a
far
broader
basis
for
the
limitation
than
that
which
was
expressed
in
the
california
case
and
i
think
it
strikes
more
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
it
is
also
the
approach
which
was
adopted
by
all
eight
justices
in
the
case
of
new
york
versus
united
states.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
the
new
york
case
that
“the
fact
that
ours
is
a
federal
constitutional
system
as
expressly
recognized
in
the
tenth
amendment
carries
with
it
implications
regarding
the
taxing
power
as
in
other
aspects
of
government,”
citing
his
authority,
hopkins
federal
versus
cleary,
which
of
course
involved
a
limitation
on
the
commerce
and
banking
powers.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
anglim
cases,
the
california
belt
railroad
tax
cases
as
a
result
of
ashton
versus
cameron
and
of
new
york
versus
united
states
and
as
a
result
of
the
other
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
which
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
go
into
at
this
stage,
it
would
appear
that
the
distinction
which
was
raised
in
the
first
california
case
was
inappropriate
and
no
longer
recognized,
but
then
it
was
repeated
in
the
case
of
case
versus
bowles
reported
at
327
u.s.
92.
now,
in
case
versus
bowles,
the
court
rejected
the
distinction
between
essential
and
nonessential
state
functions
with
respect
to
the
war
power
because
it
appeared
to
be
unworkable.
this
is
what
the
court
said,
citing
the
new
york
tax
case
in
which
the
court
was
unable
to
arrive
at
any
agreement
as
to
where
the
balance
would
be
struck.
based
upon
the
new
york
case,
the
court
just
said,
--
simply
said,
it
seemed
to
me
that
“we
can't
work
out
any
kind
of
balance
therefore
there
isn't
any.”
now,
in
that
case,
the
question
was
whether
the
power
of
the
state
of
washington
to
sell
timber
to
the
highest
bider
was
subordinate
to
the
opa
ceiling
price
regulations
which
had
been
issued
pursuant
to
the
war
power.
in
that
context,
the
essential
and
nonessential
distinction
which
had
been
raised
as
a
test
by
some
of
the
justices
in
the
new
york
tax
case
which
had
been
accepted
before
in
tax
cases
may
well
had
been
unworkable
and
maybe
that
distinction
is
unworkable
here.
but
even
that
would
not
mean
that
no
limitation
is
to
be
implied
because
i
submit
that
theory
itself
would
be
unworkable.
to
demonstrate
this,
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
what
public
law
89601
actually
does.
now
in
the
middle
of
a
fiscal
year
that
is
after
state
budgets
had
already
been
enacted,
after
the
next
necessary
taxes
had
been
levy,
along
comes
congress
and
raises
the
pay
of
state
employees.
now
we
stipulated
below
and
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
cost
of
this
to
the
state
just
the
monetary
cost
alone
would
be
enormous,
perhaps
$100
million
to
$200
million
annually,
whether
it's
200
or
100
we
submit
as
terribly
significant,
but
it
would
be
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
for
the
first
year
of
operation.
of
course
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
this
is
--
let
me
clear
this
up
now
mr.
justice
white
in
contrast
to
the
impression
sought
to
be
conveyed
of
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
unions.
the
problem
here
is
not
with
the
minimum
wage.
the
instances
of
sub-minimal
wages
among
the
state
employees
is
rather
limited
and
this
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
this
is
primarily
overtime.
what
this
act
does
essentially
without
getting
into
the
statutory
problems
of
it,
is
to
eliminate
the
device
of
compensatory
time
which
all
levels
of
government
have
used
for
many
years.
that
is
if
an
employee
works,
if
the
wage,
if
the
hourly
thing
is
40
hours
and
an
employee
works
44
hours
in
one
week,
he
would
be
given
four
hours
off
at
some
other
time
and
he
could
accumulate
these
extra
hours
so
he
could
take
a
whole
day
off
and
this
worked
well
in
both
the
federal
and
the
state
systems.
the
effect
of
this
act
is
that
unless
the
compensatory
time
can
be
given
within
the
same
pay
period,
the
state
can
no
longer
use
it.
it
must
pay
a
premium
overtime
and
it
is
this
of
course
which
applies
not
only
to
people
making
a
dollar
an
hour
but
people
to
making
$10.00
an
hour
as
well
and
it's
this
which
affects
the
primary
--
the
major
cost
burden
because
we
stipulated
below
and
the
record
will
show
that
in
many
instances,
it's
just
impossible
for
state
governments
to
compensate
their
people
within
the
same
pay
period.
i
think
the
very
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
with
these
disturbances
in
the
city
will
demonstrate
with
all
of
the
overtime
that
had
to
be
paid
under
this
act
if
it
were
applicable
to
those
people
and
the
constitutional
question
would
be
that
it
could
be
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
to
take
care
of
what
sir?
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no.
this
is
what
--
it
is
so
particularly
distressing
about
the
whole
affair.
this
act
was
passed
without
any
consideration
being
given
to
it.
the
public
school
people
were
put
under
without
any
debate
on
the
house
floor.
it
was
passed
in
conference
committee.
well,
let
me
backtrack.
the
house
labor
committee
which
originally
had
this
excluded
public
school
people.
on
the
floor
of
the
house
without
any
debate
somebody
proposed
an
amendment
to
include
some
900,000
public
school
people
and
it
was
passed
that
way.
the
senate
labor
committee
after
the
house
action
excluded
to
public
school
people
saying
that
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
burden
of
this
on
the
states.
yet
and
the
senate
passed
it
that
way
and
in
conference
committee,
the
house
version
was
the
one
which
resulted
without
any
conference
committee
report
indicating
why.
to
my
knowledge,
no
state
agency
or
affected
agency
was
ever
notified
of
the
bill
or
asked
to
appear
to
explain.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
any
consideration
was
given
either
to
the
constitutional
aspects
of
it
or
to
the
economic
burden
upon
the
states.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
saying
that
it's
an
important
part
of
it
in
the
whole
flavoring
of
this,
but
it's
–
i
am
not
resting
on
the
fact
that
the
additional
cost
alone
is
sufficient.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no
sir.
it
only
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
it
excluded
professional
and
administrative
people.
it's
in
its
minimum
wage
of
this
i
think
perhaps
the
overtime
too.
it's
directed
at
the
lower
paid
people
but
as
i
say
with
respect
to
state
employment
there
had
been
no
evidence
of
any
more
than
minimum
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
yes
sir.
constitutionally,
we
submit
that
if
the
only
task
is
whether
these
schools
and
hospitals
buy
goods
in
commerce,
we
stipulated
that
the
governor's
office
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
the
governor's
office
by
things
in
commerce
too.
they
can
tell
the
governor
how
much
he's
got
to
make
and
how
much
the
legislators
have
to
be
paid
and
how
long
they
have
to
sit.
i
mean
to
test
--
the
government
claims
this
is
conjuring
up
horribles,
but
we
submit
that
this
is
isn't
conjuring
up
horribles
at
all.
this
is
the
constitutional
power
we're
talking
about.
in
any
event,
the
act
takes
effect
in
the
middle
of
a
fiscal
year
after
all
of
these
budgets
are
set.
now,
we
agree
that
there
are
only
two
ways
of
complying
with
this
act.
either
we
cut
back
programs
in
the
middle
of
the
year
and
thereby
divert
funds
which
were
specifically
appropriated
by
legislatures
for
specific
purposes
to
other
purposes
or
we
call
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
to
levy
new
taxes
to
increase
appropriations
in
order
to
meet
the
act
or
in
some
cases
i
might
add
assemble
a
state
constitutional
convention
in
order
to
increase
taxable
limits
which
were
set
by
state
constitutions.
now
this
goes
as
i
submit
to
the
court
way
beyond
some
incidental
regulation
of
schools
and
hospitals.
this
requires
bypassing
of
the
most
basic
and
fundamental
attribute
of
state
government
and
that
is
the
power
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
state
government
itself.
the
power
of
state
government
to
decide
how
much
taxes
to
levy,
how
to
distribute
the
revenue
among
various
state
programs
and
no
where
in
his
brief
does
the
secretary
of
labor
comment
on
this.
i
think
he
casted
off
under
some
of
these
cases
as
unimportant,
but
we
submit
it's
not
unimportant.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
we
would
still
be
here
because
there
is
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
this
is
even
commerce
in
the
sense
of
the
constitution.
i
think
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
it
would,
but
i
must
confess
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it
maybe
less
so,
but
i
think
it
still
presents
a
very
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
my
argument
is
this
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
act
in
question
does.
now,
i
think
in
doing
that,
it's
hard
to
make
these
fine
distinctions;
hospital
is
okay,
schools
maybe
not.
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
the
act
itself
and
what
it
does
and
if
it
so
substantially
interferes
with
state
government
then
it's
bad.
if
it
doesn't
then
it's
alright.
we
don't
dispute
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
or
that
certain
state
functions
are
so
regulable.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
california
case.
if
we
were
running
a
state
railroad
or
selling
mineral
waters
or
something
like
that,
there'd
no
question
that
they
could
regulate
this
kind
of
activity.
in
fact,
it's
so
done.
the
second
california
case
applied
the
railway
labor
act
to
the
belt
railway
and
we
have
no
qualms
with
that.
i
think
it's
more
of
a
balancing
approach
and
i
would
like
to
expand
on
that.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
no
sir.
i'm
not
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
i
would
accept
that,
but
i
would
like
to
paraphrase
it
if
i
may.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
i
think
that
--
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
whether
the
congress
can
regulate
state
hospitals
or
state
schools,
but
simply
whether
the
regulation
doesn't
go
beyond
that
and
more
substantially
affect
state
government
in
itself
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
because
in
this
instance
with
respect
to
this
particular
act,
it
does
a
way
entirely
with
the
concept
of
state
legislatures
determining
what
taxes
to
levy,
where
to
appropriate
the
money,
what
the
scope
--
is
going
to
be.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
not
just
because
of
the
financial
impact,
but
simply,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
increase
the
total
cost,
$100
million
or
$10,000.
the
point
is
that
this
is
where
you
disrupt
the
entire
budgetary
system
by
making
the
states
to
pay
their
own
employees
more
than
they
have
appropriated
money
to
do.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
that
was
taxed.
that
wasn't
--
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
well,
i
think
it's
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
are
activities
which
had
been
so
regulated
of
an
income
producing
situation.
it's
the
running
of
a
railroad
or
the
selling
of
mineral
water
doesn't
involve
the
same
kind
of
situation
where
you've
got
to
get
your
money
solely
from
the
state
legislature.
if
your
employees
have
to
be
paid
more
then
you
hike
the
price
of
your
freight
tariff
or
you
raises
the
price
of
your
mineral
waters
to
do
it.
this
is
--
the
states
aren't
quite
put
in
quite
the
same
position.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
these
activities.
now,
i
will
submit
that
there
is
no
rationale
analogy
between
this
type
of
control
and
regulation
that
we're
involved
in
here
and
regulations
concerning
the
growing
of
wheat
or
the
operation
of
railroad
or
dock
facilities
or
even
a
sewage
system.
this
strikes
i
think
more
at
the
very
heart
of
the
state
government.
now,
i
think
that
the
court
below
agreed
that
this
was
a
case
of
first
impression
where
the
invasion
of
federal
power
is
the
greatest
and
i
think
that
this
court
must
review
those
cases,
the
dicta
which
are
relied
on
and
determine
where
this
line
is
to
be
drawn.
i
think
in
judging
the
different
approaches,
it
seems
rather
irrelevant
to
consider
whether
one
power
is
exclusive
and
another
concurrent.
i
think
these
are
clichés
that
don't
really
describe
the
total
quantum
of
the
power.
what
we
must
look
to
is
why
is
there
a
limitation
at
all.
now
in
the
tax
cases
it's
because
it
was
early
recognize
that
if
the
federal
government
could
tax
the
sovereign
governmental
functions
or
the
activities
of
the
state,
it
could
destroy
the
state
as
in
effect
of
political
entity.
now
we
are
submitting
to
the
court
how
is
this
commerce
power
any
different
when
it
is
used
this
way
when
they
tell
the
states
how
much
taxes
to
levy,
how
to
appropriate
tax
derived
revenues.
we
submit
that
there's
no
logical
distinction
between
these
two
powers.
the
rationale
for
limiting
the
scope
of
one
is
the
rationale
for
limiting
the
scope
of
the
other.
now,
if
this
approach
is
adopted,
if
the
tax
limitations
are
implied
on
the
commerce
power,
we
don't
consider
that
it
would
be
terribly
unworkable
at
all.
it
would
only
mean
that
this
court
will
act
to
--
view
acts
of
congress
in
the
light
of
whether
they
seriously
intrude
upon
basic
functions
of
state
government
and
you
don't
need
clichés
like
essential
or
governmental
or
sovereign
to
do
this.
you
don't
need
a
mathematical
formula.
so
many
of
the
justices
have
said
in
the
past,
it's
a
delicate
balancing
process.
it's
not
an
easy
one,
but
we
submit
it's
a
necessary
one.
what
you've
got
to
do
is
to
examine
this
act,
look
at
what
it
does
and
determine
whether
it's
so
interferes
with
states
as
states
that
exceeds
the
national
power.
this
will
have
to
be
done
i
submit
on
a
case
by
case
basis
looking
at
each
act
individually.
out
of
this
perhaps
will
involve
some
guidelines
but
this
need
not
be
made
explicit
now.
all
that
is
required
now
is
to
recognize
that
federalism
is
an
implied
limitation
on
federal
power
and
to
decide
on
whatever
test
is
adopted
if
you
accept
the
limitation
that
this
act,
public
law
89601
exceeds
that
limitation
and
is
therefore
void.
mr.
alan
m.
wilner
about
$4.5
million
--
well,
it's
about
$2.5
million
directly
the
first
year
of
operation
all
in
overtime.
in
addition
to
that
under
maryland
law,
all
employees
must
be
treated
the
same.
we
can't
discriminate
from
those
who
are
under
the
federal
act
and
those
who
are
not.
so
the
additional
cost
to
the
state
of
treating
the
non-covered
employees
would
be
almost
another
$2
million.
i
think
the
stipulated
fact
which
shows
about
$4
million
to
$4.5
million
the
first
year
and
of
course
as
the
minimum
wage
goes
up
each
year,
this
will
become
more
and
more
expensive
both
in
the
minimum
wage
terms
as
well
as
the
overtime.
