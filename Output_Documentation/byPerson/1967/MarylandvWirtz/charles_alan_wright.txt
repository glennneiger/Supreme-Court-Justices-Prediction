mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
year
ago
at
a
time
when
i
had
no
expectation
in
being
professionally
connected
with
this
case,
i
gave
the
facts
of
the
final
examination
question
in
constitutional
law
that
seem
to
me
that
raises
very
testing
issues
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
must
brainwashed
my
students
to
find
the
statute
unconstitutional.
i
intend
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
commerce
clause
issues
here.
they
are
as
mr.
wilner
said
issues
of
first
impression.
there
is
no
case
that
i
can
point
to
nor
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
can
point
to
that
tells
us
unerringly
the
answer
here.
but
there
are
in
my
judgment
principles
that
furnish
guides
to
right
decision.
i
start
out
with
the
fact
that
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
i
take
the
words
among
the
several
states
are
words
of
limitation.
they
were
not
used
by
the
framers
and
put
them
at
the
document
longer
and
there
is
a
difference
between
a
plenary
power
to
regulate
all
commerce
and
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states.
i
suggest
first
that
where
in
fact
we
have
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
this
is
undoubtedly
a
conception
that
has
expanded
as
our
transportation
network
and
our
economy
expanded,
but
here,
there
is
of
course
no
doubt
whatever
about
congress'
power
to
act.
second,
where
we
have
an
activity
that
is
local,
it
may
still
have
such
an
impact
on
commerce
among
the
several
states
that
it
must
be
held
to
be
within
the
power
of
congress.
this
is
a
lesson
that
texas
learned
in
1914.
third,
that
when
the
relation
between
local
activity
and
commerce
among
the
several
states
is
not
sufficiently
close
then
the
power
of
congress
has
come
to
an
end
as
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
what
remains
the
authoritative
exposition
of
the
congress
clause,
it
will
be
inconvenient
and
absolutely
unnecessary
for
the
congress
to
have
been
given
a
complete
power
over
all
commercial
activity
and
he
drew
the
line
in
saying
that
congress
can
regulate
that
commerce
that
concerns
more
states
than
one.
the
problem
then
becomes
one
of
measuring
the
relation
between
a
local
activity
at
interstate
commerce
and
decided
when
that
relationship
is
close
enough
so
that
congress
may
properly
invoke
its
powers.
the
court
has
used
various
terms
in
recent
history
and
we
rely
only
on
the
cases
from
1937
on,
close
and
substantial,
close
and
intimate,
substantial
and
harmful,
all
of
these
terms
suggest
that
there
must
be
a
propinquity
between
the
activity
and
substantiality.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course
it
is
going
to
apply
the
retail
stores.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
test
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
we
have
an
entity
that
is
charging
people
for
what
it
is
doing
and
that
therefore
the
wages
and
hours
that
it
pays
its
employees
will
have
an
effect
on
the
price
that
the
customer
ultimately
pays.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
arguing
that
state
hospitals
are
outside
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
fact
that
in
one
--
the
patient
is
paying
and
then
the
other
as
a
practical
matter,
he
is
not.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
stipulation
and
the
facts
between
texas
and
the
united
states
show
that
in
the
year
involved
of
2900
patients
in
our
tuberculosis
hospitals,
only
nine
paid
any
fee,
that
in
baylor
county
hospital,
94%
of
patients
paid
nothing
whatever
that
in
our
state
schools
between
5%
and
10%
of
the
parents
may
pay
the
nominal
charge
that
we
assert.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
want
to
say
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
that
is
a
complete
answer.
there
might
be
an
argument
to
be
made
for
the
private
hospital,
but
i
don't
think
it's
an
argument
that
i
have
to
make.
when
we
turn
to
look
what
is
the
relation
here
between
this
concededly
local
activity
and
commerce
among
the
several
states,
we
find
that
various
stages
in
the
history
of
the
case,
different
explanations
had
been
suggested.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
itself
except
for
the
committee
report.
there
was
no
testimony.
nobody
was
before
the
congress
saying,
“please
make
this
state
institution
subject
to
the
fail
labor
standards
act.”
so
that
is
not
a
helpful
source.
the
committee
report
says
that
the
state
institutions
are
in
competition
with
private
proprietary
institutions
and
that
it
means
unfair
competition
and
the
facts
i
suggest
simply
are
against
that.
indeed
the
record,
we
have
testimony
from
the
precedents
of
various
educational
institutions
in
texas
in
private
institutions
saying
that
they
are
not
in
competition
with
the
university
of
texas.
they
wouldn't
have
any
place
to
put
our
students
if
they
could
attract
them
away.
in
the
district
court,
judge
winter
and
the
opinion
that
went
in
the
direction
that
the
government
desired,
found
that
we
spend
billions
of
dollars
every
year
in
interstate
commerce.
and
so
he
said,
inevitably,
these
activities
have
a
substantial
impact
in
interstate
commerce.
of
course
we
spend
the
money
and
of
course
our
spending
has
a
substantial
impact
and
i
do
not
doubt
at
all
that
congress
could
regulate
the
way
in
which
state
institutions
purchase
goods
in
interstate
commerce
and
indeed
in
some
aspects
it
does,
food
and
drugs
act
and
things
like
that
i
would
assume
are
as
applicable
to
the
states
as
to
any
private
purchaser
of
goods,
but
i
do
not
think
that
because
one
aspect
of
a
state
institution
may
affect
commerce
that
that
is
a
waiver
entitling
congress
to
regulate
that
state
institution
in
everyone
of
its
activities.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
is
to
regulate
a
particular
activity
or
a
particular
function
of
the
state
institution,
it
must
be
because
that
activity
or
that
function
have
the
needed
relation
to
commerce
among
the
several
states.
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
here,
the
united
states
asserts
that
there
may
be
labor
disputes
as
indeed
there
may
that
substandard
working
conditions
or
cause
of
labor
disputes
and
that
if
labor
disputes
go
on
long
enough
then
it
would
diminish
the
purchases
that
the
states
make
and
in
that
respect
interfere
with
interstate
commerce.
with
great
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
stray
from
reality.
if
there
is
any
instance
in
which
a
state
has
enforce
to
put
an
end
to
its
public
schools
or
its
hospitals
or
its
institutions
of
higher
learning
because
its
janitors
and
its
scrub
women
have
gone
on
strike
over
substandard
working
conditions,
we
are
not
advised
about
it
by
the
united
states
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
so
advised.
in
the
parden
case
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we're
going
to
keep
the
public
schools
running
mr.
justice
white
regardless
of
strikes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
for
temporary
periods,
they
haven't
manage
to
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
think
so
--
i
would
not
think
it
reaches
the
constitutional
question.
i
would
think
that
if
the
labor
relations
of
state
employees
were
concerned
that
congress
arguably
could
bring
them
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
at
present
time
they
are
exempted
from
that
act,
but
if
this
is
a
congressional
concern
to
prevent
labor
unrest
then
the
nlra
is
certainly
a
far
more
direct
means
of
getting
at
the
problem
than
relying
on
the
flsa.
i
would
like
to
invoke
in
this
connection
a
phrase
that
mr.
justice
brennan
used
in
the
parden
case
when
he
referred
to
the
common
sense
of
this
nation's
federalism
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
been
a
common
sensical
matter
as
necessarily
a
question
is
complicated
as
federalism
and
intergovernmental
relations
passed
today
and
that
common
sense
teaches
that
we
aren't
going
to
let
the
public
schools
or
the
universities
or
the
state
hospitals
be
closed.
we're
going
to
keep
them
in
operation.
they're
going
to
continue
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
every
year
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
to
make
this
a
tool
for
allowing
regulation
in
this
respect
of
our
state
institutions
would
be
to
substitute
remote
and
speculative
impact
on
interstate
commerce
for
the
close
of
substantial
impact
that
the
court
has
always
said
is
required.
with
regard
to
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
sir
that
the
impact
there
is
an
extremely
close
one,
that
the
possibility
of
destructive
competition
is
present
unless
the
congress
can
regulate
the
wages
for
manufacturing
institutions.
states
in
which
low
wages
are
paid
and
to
be
able
to
sell
their
goods
at
a
competitive
advantage
in
those
states
that
have
locally
raised
their
standards.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
think
that
a
work
stoppage
at
the
jones
&
laughlin
plant
of
course
has
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
state
commerce
as
the
court
held
in
301
u.s.,
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
work
stoppage
that
the
university
of
texas
law
school
is
going
to
have
any
impact
or
whatever
on
interstate
commerce.
if
our
janitors
go
out
because
they're
dissatisfied
in
a
week,
we
can
have
new
janitors
or
they
will
be
back
at
work
and
we
will
--
have
bought
as
many
desks
and
blackboards
and
books
as
we
would
have
if
there
had
been
no
work
stoppage,
but
if
it's
the
jones
and
laughlin
plant,
commerce
itself
stop
the
moment
the
milk
is
cold.
as
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
i
have
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
texas,
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
commerce
and
the
question
of
impact
on
the
states,
the
question
to
which
mr.
wilner
addressed
himself,
can
profitably
be
viewed
as
if
they
were
totally
independent.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
a
doubtful
question
of
power
under
the
commerce
clause
then
it
is
right
to
ask
yourself
what
is
it
that
congress
is
seeking
to
reach
and
the
fact
that
the
states
do
enjoy
the
special
position
in
our
federal
system
is
something
that
maybe
taken
into
the
balance
in
deciding
whether
or
not
congress
is
here
gone
beyond
commerce
among
the
several
states.
i
frankly
submit
to
the
court
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
not
beyond
the
line
then
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
any
commercial
regulation
that
would
be
beyond
the
line
that
here
of
course,
we
can
talk
about
work
stoppages
and
the
fact
that
perhaps
these
will
have
in
some
very
unlikely
contingency
an
affect
on
commerce,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
that
would
be
different
from
that
and
i
remind
the
court
of
what
was
set
for
a
unanimous
court
in
1944
in
the
polish
national
alliance
case
that
scholastic
reasoning
may
prove
that
no
activity
is
isolated
within
the
boundaries
of
a
single
state
but
that
cannot
justify
absorption
of
legislative
power
by
the
united
states
over
every
activity.
with
great
respect,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
here
being
asked
to
accept
scholastic
reasoning
and
the
reasoning
that
does
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
longer
any
difference
between
interstate
commerce
and
the
general
subject
to
commerce.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
my
position
is
not
quite
that.
if
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
i
will
retain
my
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
were
retained
by
a
private
hospital,
i
think
perhaps
i
could
make
an
argument
but
i
could
not
make
the
argument
that
i
can
make
when
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
my
position
maybe
precisely
stated
in
this
fashion
that
i
am
arguing
that
a
public
hospital
in
which
very
few
patients
are
charged
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
commerce
power.
the
questions
of
commerce
power
are
questions
of
degree
and
a
different
result
might
be
reached
-
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
--
if
i
am
to
take
a
position
for
purposes
of
this
case
only
will
be
that
the
private
hospital
that
charges
$50.00
a
day
would
be
subject
to
regulation.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
because
no
fee
being
paid.
these
are
services
that
are
being
provided
to
most
of
the
patient's
free
of
charge.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
has
this
relation
that
if
we
suppose
two
private
hospitals,
one
of
them
paying
the
minimum
wage
to
its
employees
and
one
not,
but
then
the
hospital
that
is
paying
the
lower
wage
would
be
able
to
charge
lower
prices
and
to
that
extent
it
will
attract
the
people
to
come
to
it
rather
to
go
to
some
place
else.
here
we
have
competition
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
or
to
enjoy
a
lower
university
rates.
i
can
well
imagine
that
a
private
university
might
attract
students
if
they’re
able
to
charge
less
than
some
other
university
of
similar
distinction
and
these
would
be
people
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
with
reluctance
that
i
take
that
position,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case,
he
asked
me
to
take
a
position
on
that,
that
has
to
be
my
position.
i
think
that
helps
to
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
to
mr.
wilner.
it
may
not
been
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
you'll
excuse
me,
and
that
is
why
it
isn't
to
the
same
impact
if
you
start
charging
minimum
wages
when
you
turn
out
mineral
waters
as
when
you
operate
a
hospital
and
the
answer
is
that
once
again
the
fact
of
competition.
the
fact
that
the
state
owned
mineral
water
plant
can
do
the
same
thing
that
a
privately
owned
mineral
water
plant
can
do.
it
can
charge
more
for
its
mineral
water.
we
can't
charge
more
to
attend
to
public
schools
in
texas
because
we
don't
charge
anybody
and
that
is
the
typical
situation
throughout
the
states.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
certainly
failed
to
communicate
what
our
position
is
if
i
have
led
the
learned
solicitor
general
to
suppose
that
it
resembles
the
position
the
sixth
circuit
took
in
united
states
v.
ohio,
a
position
that
quite
accurately
describes
as
being,
well,
it's
just
a
little
wheat
there
for
it
doesn't
have
much
effect
in
interstate
commerce.
the
position
we
take
here
fully
accepts
wickard
v.
filburn
and
it
seem
to
me
that
united
states
v.
ohio
was
an
a
fortiori
case
from
that.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
wickard,
justice
jackson
examined
at
some
length
the
economics
of
the
wheat
industry.
he
found
as
i
recall
that
about
20%
of
all
wheat
is
consumed
at
the
place
where
it
grown.
this
is
the
single
most
variable
factor
in
the
market
and
therefore
the
factor
that
had
the
most
impact
on
the
price
of
wheat
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
and
although
the
amount
of
wheat
consumed
in
the
ohio
jail
or
in
filburn's
farm
by
itself
was
insignificant
taken
as
a
whole
the
problem
of
home
consumed
wheat
was
one
of
great
importance
if
commerce
would
be
effectively
regulated.
that
is
far
different
from
our
position
here.
we're
not
saying
that
what
our
people
do
as
something
so
trivial.
we're
saying
simply
that
it
is
something
that
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce.
in
his
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no
sir.
i
don't
have
to
think
that
competition
is
by
any
means
the
only
factor
that
may
permit
the
congress
to
invoke
the
commerce
power.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
one
looks
to
and
determining
is
their
--
the
relation
here.
mr.
justice
white's
questions
dramatized
for
me.
the
difficulty
i
had
with
the
syllogism
imposed
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
cannot
say
on
the
argument
as
he
puts
it
how
there
is
any
stopping
point.
i
do
not
see
with
regard
to
his
made
true
premise
how
there
could
be
any
limit
on
the
concept
of
commerce
among
the
several
states
that
the
hearings
leading
to
the
1966
legislation.
the
secretary
of
labor
told
the
congress
for
example
that
it
was
beyond
its
power
to
fix
minimum
wages
for
a
truck
driver
if
he
drove
with
his
truck
only
in
intrastate
commerce
and
yet
i
dare
say
that
a
truck
or
the
gasoline
it
uses
or
things
at
that
sort
would
be
bought
out
of
the
state
and
the
possibility
of
a
work
stoppage
would
be
as
real
or
as
unreal
in
its
impact
on
commerce
as
we
have
here.
with
regard
to
the
minor
premise
put
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
suggest
again
that
the
congress
can
bring
the
states
within
some
regulations
of
commerce,
but
because
states
are
states,
they
do
not
exist
merely
at
the
pleasure
of
a
transient
majority
of
the
congress
and
that
their
interferences
with
the
function
of
a
state
in
its
capacity
as
a
constituent
partner
in
the
federal
union,
the
congress
cannot
touch
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
and
in
my
judgment
mr.
justice
white
the
two
arguments
fit
together.
you
can't
separate
them.
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
the
practice
in
this
court
to
strike
down
acts
of
congress
because
the
majority
of
the
court
thought
that
the
act
of
congress
was
a
bad
thing
and
i'm
sure
that
my
friend
and
i
would
make
common
cause
in
saying
that
that
was
an
inappropriate
approach
to
judicial
function.
i
submit
that
it
would
be
equally
wrong
for
this
court
to
uphold
an
act
of
congress
because
it
accomplishes
something
that
we
may
think
is
good.
the
question
in
either
event
is
not
whether
we
like
or
dislike
what
the
congress
has
done,
it
is
whether
the
congress
is
active
in
the
powers
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
pressed
in
it.
as
a
voter
and
a
taxpayer
in
texas,
i
would
be
happy
to
support
a
state
minimum
wage.
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
i
do
not
think
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
the
power
that
is
here
claimed.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
year
ago
at
a
time
when
i
had
no
expectation
in
being
professionally
connected
with
this
case,
i
gave
the
facts
of
the
final
examination
question
in
constitutional
law
that
seem
to
me
that
raises
very
testing
issues
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
must
brainwashed
my
students
to
find
the
statute
unconstitutional.
i
intend
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
commerce
clause
issues
here.
they
are
as
mr.
wilner
said
issues
of
first
impression.
there
is
no
case
that
i
can
point
to
nor
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
can
point
to
that
tells
us
unerringly
the
answer
here.
but
there
are
in
my
judgment
principles
that
furnish
guides
to
right
decision.
i
start
out
with
the
fact
that
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
i
take
the
words
among
the
several
states
are
words
of
limitation.
they
were
not
used
by
the
framers
and
put
them
at
the
document
longer
and
there
is
a
difference
between
a
plenary
power
to
regulate
all
commerce
and
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states.
i
suggest
first
that
where
in
fact
we
have
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
this
is
undoubtedly
a
conception
that
has
expanded
as
our
transportation
network
and
our
economy
expanded,
but
here,
there
is
of
course
no
doubt
whatever
about
congress'
power
to
act.
second,
where
we
have
an
activity
that
is
local,
it
may
still
have
such
an
impact
on
commerce
among
the
several
states
that
it
must
be
held
to
be
within
the
power
of
congress.
this
is
a
lesson
that
texas
learned
in
1914.
third,
that
when
the
relation
between
local
activity
and
commerce
among
the
several
states
is
not
sufficiently
close
then
the
power
of
congress
has
come
to
an
end
as
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
what
remains
the
authoritative
exposition
of
the
congress
clause,
it
will
be
inconvenient
and
absolutely
unnecessary
for
the
congress
to
have
been
given
a
complete
power
over
all
commercial
activity
and
he
drew
the
line
in
saying
that
congress
can
regulate
that
commerce
that
concerns
more
states
than
one.
the
problem
then
becomes
one
of
measuring
the
relation
between
a
local
activity
at
interstate
commerce
and
decided
when
that
relationship
is
close
enough
so
that
congress
may
properly
invoke
its
powers.
the
court
has
used
various
terms
in
recent
history
and
we
rely
only
on
the
cases
from
1937
on,
close
and
substantial,
close
and
intimate,
substantial
and
harmful,
all
of
these
terms
suggest
that
there
must
be
a
propinquity
between
the
activity
and
substantiality.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course
it
is
going
to
apply
the
retail
stores.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
test
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
we
have
an
entity
that
is
charging
people
for
what
it
is
doing
and
that
therefore
the
wages
and
hours
that
it
pays
its
employees
will
have
an
effect
on
the
price
that
the
customer
ultimately
pays.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
arguing
that
state
hospitals
are
outside
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
fact
that
in
one
--
the
patient
is
paying
and
then
the
other
as
a
practical
matter,
he
is
not.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
stipulation
and
the
facts
between
texas
and
the
united
states
show
that
in
the
year
involved
of
2900
patients
in
our
tuberculosis
hospitals,
only
nine
paid
any
fee,
that
in
baylor
county
hospital,
94%
of
patients
paid
nothing
whatever
that
in
our
state
schools
between
5%
and
10%
of
the
parents
may
pay
the
nominal
charge
that
we
assert.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
want
to
say
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
that
is
a
complete
answer.
there
might
be
an
argument
to
be
made
for
the
private
hospital,
but
i
don't
think
it's
an
argument
that
i
have
to
make.
when
we
turn
to
look
what
is
the
relation
here
between
this
concededly
local
activity
and
commerce
among
the
several
states,
we
find
that
various
stages
in
the
history
of
the
case,
different
explanations
had
been
suggested.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
itself
except
for
the
committee
report.
there
was
no
testimony.
nobody
was
before
the
congress
saying,
“please
make
this
state
institution
subject
to
the
fail
labor
standards
act.”
so
that
is
not
a
helpful
source.
the
committee
report
says
that
the
state
institutions
are
in
competition
with
private
proprietary
institutions
and
that
it
means
unfair
competition
and
the
facts
i
suggest
simply
are
against
that.
indeed
the
record,
we
have
testimony
from
the
precedents
of
various
educational
institutions
in
texas
in
private
institutions
saying
that
they
are
not
in
competition
with
the
university
of
texas.
they
wouldn't
have
any
place
to
put
our
students
if
they
could
attract
them
away.
in
the
district
court,
judge
winter
and
the
opinion
that
went
in
the
direction
that
the
government
desired,
found
that
we
spend
billions
of
dollars
every
year
in
interstate
commerce.
and
so
he
said,
inevitably,
these
activities
have
a
substantial
impact
in
interstate
commerce.
of
course
we
spend
the
money
and
of
course
our
spending
has
a
substantial
impact
and
i
do
not
doubt
at
all
that
congress
could
regulate
the
way
in
which
state
institutions
purchase
goods
in
interstate
commerce
and
indeed
in
some
aspects
it
does,
food
and
drugs
act
and
things
like
that
i
would
assume
are
as
applicable
to
the
states
as
to
any
private
purchaser
of
goods,
but
i
do
not
think
that
because
one
aspect
of
a
state
institution
may
affect
commerce
that
that
is
a
waiver
entitling
congress
to
regulate
that
state
institution
in
everyone
of
its
activities.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
is
to
regulate
a
particular
activity
or
a
particular
function
of
the
state
institution,
it
must
be
because
that
activity
or
that
function
have
the
needed
relation
to
commerce
among
the
several
states.
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
here,
the
united
states
asserts
that
there
may
be
labor
disputes
as
indeed
there
may
that
substandard
working
conditions
or
cause
of
labor
disputes
and
that
if
labor
disputes
go
on
long
enough
then
it
would
diminish
the
purchases
that
the
states
make
and
in
that
respect
interfere
with
interstate
commerce.
with
great
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
stray
from
reality.
if
there
is
any
instance
in
which
a
state
has
enforce
to
put
an
end
to
its
public
schools
or
its
hospitals
or
its
institutions
of
higher
learning
because
its
janitors
and
its
scrub
women
have
gone
on
strike
over
substandard
working
conditions,
we
are
not
advised
about
it
by
the
united
states
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
so
advised.
in
the
parden
case
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we're
going
to
keep
the
public
schools
running
mr.
justice
white
regardless
of
strikes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
for
temporary
periods,
they
haven't
manage
to
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
think
so
--
i
would
not
think
it
reaches
the
constitutional
question.
i
would
think
that
if
the
labor
relations
of
state
employees
were
concerned
that
congress
arguably
could
bring
them
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
at
present
time
they
are
exempted
from
that
act,
but
if
this
is
a
congressional
concern
to
prevent
labor
unrest
then
the
nlra
is
certainly
a
far
more
direct
means
of
getting
at
the
problem
than
relying
on
the
flsa.
i
would
like
to
invoke
in
this
connection
a
phrase
that
mr.
justice
brennan
used
in
the
parden
case
when
he
referred
to
the
common
sense
of
this
nation's
federalism
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
been
a
common
sensical
matter
as
necessarily
a
question
is
complicated
as
federalism
and
intergovernmental
relations
passed
today
and
that
common
sense
teaches
that
we
aren't
going
to
let
the
public
schools
or
the
universities
or
the
state
hospitals
be
closed.
we're
going
to
keep
them
in
operation.
they're
going
to
continue
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
every
year
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
to
make
this
a
tool
for
allowing
regulation
in
this
respect
of
our
state
institutions
would
be
to
substitute
remote
and
speculative
impact
on
interstate
commerce
for
the
close
of
substantial
impact
that
the
court
has
always
said
is
required.
with
regard
to
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
sir
that
the
impact
there
is
an
extremely
close
one,
that
the
possibility
of
destructive
competition
is
present
unless
the
congress
can
regulate
the
wages
for
manufacturing
institutions.
states
in
which
low
wages
are
paid
and
to
be
able
to
sell
their
goods
at
a
competitive
advantage
in
those
states
that
have
locally
raised
their
standards.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
think
that
a
work
stoppage
at
the
jones
&
laughlin
plant
of
course
has
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
state
commerce
as
the
court
held
in
301
u.s.,
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
work
stoppage
that
the
university
of
texas
law
school
is
going
to
have
any
impact
or
whatever
on
interstate
commerce.
if
our
janitors
go
out
because
they're
dissatisfied
in
a
week,
we
can
have
new
janitors
or
they
will
be
back
at
work
and
we
will
--
have
bought
as
many
desks
and
blackboards
and
books
as
we
would
have
if
there
had
been
no
work
stoppage,
but
if
it's
the
jones
and
laughlin
plant,
commerce
itself
stop
the
moment
the
milk
is
cold.
as
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
i
have
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
texas,
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
commerce
and
the
question
of
impact
on
the
states,
the
question
to
which
mr.
wilner
addressed
himself,
can
profitably
be
viewed
as
if
they
were
totally
independent.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
a
doubtful
question
of
power
under
the
commerce
clause
then
it
is
right
to
ask
yourself
what
is
it
that
congress
is
seeking
to
reach
and
the
fact
that
the
states
do
enjoy
the
special
position
in
our
federal
system
is
something
that
maybe
taken
into
the
balance
in
deciding
whether
or
not
congress
is
here
gone
beyond
commerce
among
the
several
states.
i
frankly
submit
to
the
court
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
not
beyond
the
line
then
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
any
commercial
regulation
that
would
be
beyond
the
line
that
here
of
course,
we
can
talk
about
work
stoppages
and
the
fact
that
perhaps
these
will
have
in
some
very
unlikely
contingency
an
affect
on
commerce,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
that
would
be
different
from
that
and
i
remind
the
court
of
what
was
set
for
a
unanimous
court
in
1944
in
the
polish
national
alliance
case
that
scholastic
reasoning
may
prove
that
no
activity
is
isolated
within
the
boundaries
of
a
single
state
but
that
cannot
justify
absorption
of
legislative
power
by
the
united
states
over
every
activity.
with
great
respect,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
here
being
asked
to
accept
scholastic
reasoning
and
the
reasoning
that
does
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
longer
any
difference
between
interstate
commerce
and
the
general
subject
to
commerce.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
my
position
is
not
quite
that.
if
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
i
will
retain
my
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
were
retained
by
a
private
hospital,
i
think
perhaps
i
could
make
an
argument
but
i
could
not
make
the
argument
that
i
can
make
when
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
my
position
maybe
precisely
stated
in
this
fashion
that
i
am
arguing
that
a
public
hospital
in
which
very
few
patients
are
charged
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
commerce
power.
the
questions
of
commerce
power
are
questions
of
degree
and
a
different
result
might
be
reached
-
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
--
if
i
am
to
take
a
position
for
purposes
of
this
case
only
will
be
that
the
private
hospital
that
charges
$50.00
a
day
would
be
subject
to
regulation.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
because
no
fee
being
paid.
these
are
services
that
are
being
provided
to
most
of
the
patient's
free
of
charge.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
has
this
relation
that
if
we
suppose
two
private
hospitals,
one
of
them
paying
the
minimum
wage
to
its
employees
and
one
not,
but
then
the
hospital
that
is
paying
the
lower
wage
would
be
able
to
charge
lower
prices
and
to
that
extent
it
will
attract
the
people
to
come
to
it
rather
to
go
to
some
place
else.
here
we
have
competition
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
or
to
enjoy
a
lower
university
rates.
i
can
well
imagine
that
a
private
university
might
attract
students
if
they’re
able
to
charge
less
than
some
other
university
of
similar
distinction
and
these
would
be
people
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
with
reluctance
that
i
take
that
position,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case,
he
asked
me
to
take
a
position
on
that,
that
has
to
be
my
position.
i
think
that
helps
to
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
to
mr.
wilner.
it
may
not
been
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
you'll
excuse
me,
and
that
is
why
it
isn't
to
the
same
impact
if
you
start
charging
minimum
wages
when
you
turn
out
mineral
waters
as
when
you
operate
a
hospital
and
the
answer
is
that
once
again
the
fact
of
competition.
the
fact
that
the
state
owned
mineral
water
plant
can
do
the
same
thing
that
a
privately
owned
mineral
water
plant
can
do.
it
can
charge
more
for
its
mineral
water.
we
can't
charge
more
to
attend
to
public
schools
in
texas
because
we
don't
charge
anybody
and
that
is
the
typical
situation
throughout
the
states.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
certainly
failed
to
communicate
what
our
position
is
if
i
have
led
the
learned
solicitor
general
to
suppose
that
it
resembles
the
position
the
sixth
circuit
took
in
united
states
v.
ohio,
a
position
that
quite
accurately
describes
as
being,
well,
it's
just
a
little
wheat
there
for
it
doesn't
have
much
effect
in
interstate
commerce.
the
position
we
take
here
fully
accepts
wickard
v.
filburn
and
it
seem
to
me
that
united
states
v.
ohio
was
an
a
fortiori
case
from
that.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
wickard,
justice
jackson
examined
at
some
length
the
economics
of
the
wheat
industry.
he
found
as
i
recall
that
about
20%
of
all
wheat
is
consumed
at
the
place
where
it
grown.
this
is
the
single
most
variable
factor
in
the
market
and
therefore
the
factor
that
had
the
most
impact
on
the
price
of
wheat
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
and
although
the
amount
of
wheat
consumed
in
the
ohio
jail
or
in
filburn's
farm
by
itself
was
insignificant
taken
as
a
whole
the
problem
of
home
consumed
wheat
was
one
of
great
importance
if
commerce
would
be
effectively
regulated.
that
is
far
different
from
our
position
here.
we're
not
saying
that
what
our
people
do
as
something
so
trivial.
we're
saying
simply
that
it
is
something
that
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce.
in
his
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no
sir.
i
don't
have
to
think
that
competition
is
by
any
means
the
only
factor
that
may
permit
the
congress
to
invoke
the
commerce
power.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
one
looks
to
and
determining
is
their
--
the
relation
here.
mr.
justice
white's
questions
dramatized
for
me.
the
difficulty
i
had
with
the
syllogism
imposed
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
cannot
say
on
the
argument
as
he
puts
it
how
there
is
any
stopping
point.
i
do
not
see
with
regard
to
his
made
true
premise
how
there
could
be
any
limit
on
the
concept
of
commerce
among
the
several
states
that
the
hearings
leading
to
the
1966
legislation.
the
secretary
of
labor
told
the
congress
for
example
that
it
was
beyond
its
power
to
fix
minimum
wages
for
a
truck
driver
if
he
drove
with
his
truck
only
in
intrastate
commerce
and
yet
i
dare
say
that
a
truck
or
the
gasoline
it
uses
or
things
at
that
sort
would
be
bought
out
of
the
state
and
the
possibility
of
a
work
stoppage
would
be
as
real
or
as
unreal
in
its
impact
on
commerce
as
we
have
here.
with
regard
to
the
minor
premise
put
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
suggest
again
that
the
congress
can
bring
the
states
within
some
regulations
of
commerce,
but
because
states
are
states,
they
do
not
exist
merely
at
the
pleasure
of
a
transient
majority
of
the
congress
and
that
their
interferences
with
the
function
of
a
state
in
its
capacity
as
a
constituent
partner
in
the
federal
union,
the
congress
cannot
touch
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
and
in
my
judgment
mr.
justice
white
the
two
arguments
fit
together.
you
can't
separate
them.
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
the
practice
in
this
court
to
strike
down
acts
of
congress
because
the
majority
of
the
court
thought
that
the
act
of
congress
was
a
bad
thing
and
i'm
sure
that
my
friend
and
i
would
make
common
cause
in
saying
that
that
was
an
inappropriate
approach
to
judicial
function.
i
submit
that
it
would
be
equally
wrong
for
this
court
to
uphold
an
act
of
congress
because
it
accomplishes
something
that
we
may
think
is
good.
the
question
in
either
event
is
not
whether
we
like
or
dislike
what
the
congress
has
done,
it
is
whether
the
congress
is
active
in
the
powers
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
pressed
in
it.
as
a
voter
and
a
taxpayer
in
texas,
i
would
be
happy
to
support
a
state
minimum
wage.
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
i
do
not
think
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
the
power
that
is
here
claimed.
thank
you.
