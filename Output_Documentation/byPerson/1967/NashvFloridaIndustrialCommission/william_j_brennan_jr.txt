you
mean
that
if
it's
proper
for
a
state
to
deny
compensation
even
though
there's
a
burden
on
the
right
to
strike?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
but
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
that's
alright,
we
can
impose
that.
if

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
you've
said
it
but
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
certainly
to
the
extent
its
constitutional
for
florida
to
deny
workmen's
compensation
to
do
a
strike,
there
is,
is
there
not
a
