mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of
inquiry
here
today
is
a
decision
of
the
board
of
review
of
the
florida
industrial
commission
and
that
decision
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
gottesman
is
to
the
effect
that
when
an
employee
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
nlrb,
a
labor
dispute
comes
into
existence
and
therefore
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute
the
employee
will
be
denied
benefits
under
the
state
unemployment
compensation
act
as
long
as
the
charge
or
the
dispute
is
pending.
now,
and
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
i
think
there
have
been
four
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals,
various
court
of
appeals
within
the
state
of
florida
affirming
such
determinations.
as
of
this
time,
there
has
been
no
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
involving
this
particular
issue.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
we
were
anticipating
that
this
case
might
go
there
but
as
mr.
gottesman
has
pointed
out
the
procedure
within
the
state
of
florida
in
this
particular
area
is
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
yes.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
it
is
rather
complicated
and
we
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
oppose
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
because
that
first
--
the
first
impression
that
we
have
was
that
the
state
court
procedure
had
not
been
exhausted
but
then
after
taking
another
look
at
it
while
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
probably
that
it
was.
so
whether
not
the
state
supreme
court
of
florida
will
be
reviewing
one
of
these
cases
any
time
soon
before
the
decision
of
this
court
is
forthcoming
is
not
known
but
it
is
a
rather
complicated
procedure
and
if
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
absence
of
an
attorney
from
the
attorney
general's
office
from
the
state
of
florida
have
no
way
of
knowing.
but
in
any
event,
they
did
not
file
the
brief
but
authorized
me
to
appear
orally
for
the
commission
at
this
time.
so
basically,
that
is
the
problem
before
the
court
and
we
think
that
the
issue
concerning
this
ruling
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
determination.
in
other
words,
is
the
determination
of
the
board
of
review
to
the
extent
that
the
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
for
the
nlrb
unreasonable
not
one
of
whether
or
not
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
this
petitioner
is
violated.
it
is
our
position
that
privileges
and
immunities
has
no
place
or
no
application
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
we
say
that
for
this
reason.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
order
for
that
doctrine
to
come
into
play
and
to
be
an
issue
and
in
order
for
that
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
be
violated,
we
first
of
all
have
to
be
dealing
with
a
right
of
national
citizenship.
now,
its
our
contention
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
group
of
employees,
a
limited
number
of
employees
in
this
particular
area
and
these
employees
must
be
persons
that
not
only
can
go
to
the
state
unemployment
compensation
board
and
file
a
claim
for
unemployment
compensation
but
must
also
be
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
position
of
being
eligible
or
able
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
have
this
charge
processed.
now,
no
right
of
national
citizenship
is
involved.
the
right
or
the
--
in
order
to
qualify
for
both
of
these
positions,
first
of
all,
the
person
must
be
an
employee
and
insofar
as
the
federal
aspect
of
the
situation
is
concerned,
the
person
must
be
an
employee
of
an
employer
engaged
in
an
interstate
commerce.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
citizenship.
if
this
court
held
that
this
rule
was
invalid
because
it
violated
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
would
be
in
effect
holding
that
in
order
to
first
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
within
nlrb
you
would
have
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
this
is
not
the
case
nor
was
this
result
intended
by
congress.
therefore,
we
take
the
position
at
the
outset
that
privileges
and
immunities
is
not
involved
in
this
case
whatsoever.
and
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
citizen
in
this
particular
instance
to
file
or
process
a
charge
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
now
secondly,
the
petitioner
advances
as
a
reason
for
striking
down
this
ruling
of
the
florida
industrial
commission
that
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause
and
in
support
of
this
position,
primarily
relies
upon
two
cases
one
is
davis
against
elmira
state
bank
and
the
other
one
is
hill
against
florida.
now
we
think
that
the
approach
taken
in
these
two
cases
even
if
the
supremacy
clause
is
involved
here
is
not
applicable
and
does
not
furnish
any
sufficient
or
adequate
guidelines
for
determination
that
we
must
make
here
today.
the
elmira
state
bank
case
involved
a
state
statute
and
a
federal
statute
that
were
in
direct
conflict
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
remaining
assets
of
insolvent
banks.
in
other
words,
these
two
statutes
ran
head
on
and
in
hill
against
florida
that
involved
a
statute
that
imposed
certain
conditions
upon
labor
organizations
and
business
agents
before
they
could
decay
on
business
within
the
state
of
florida
and
this
court
held
there
that
the
determination
that
was
being
made
by
the
legislature
and
the
penalties
imposed
such
as
a
complete
injunction
against
functioning
as
a
labor
organization
altogether
did
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
we
do
not
think
that
we
are
faced
with
such
a
situation
here
today.
what
--
rather
what
we
are
faced
with
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
rule.
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it's
only
inquiry
and
it's
only
purpose
in
reviewing
such
a
case
would
be
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
advanced
by
the
unemployment
compensation
commission.
now
i
think
first
of
all
we
have
to
look
at
the
reason
that
these
statutes
both
federal
and
state
were
originally
passed.
that's
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
this
statutes
which
were
passed
back
in
1935,
1936
in
that
particular
area
was
to
alleviate
mass
unemployment
rather
than
come
into
play
in
a
particular
situation
that
we
have
or
that
we
are
faced
with
here
today.
in
other
words,
the
reason
for
this
legislation
in
our
opinion
is
not
present
when
we
consider
what
the
purpose
of
the
rule
of
the
florida
board
of
review
or
the
reason
behind
that
decision.
now,
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
occasions
to
review
various
rulings
of
industrial
commissions.
once
such
rule
was
reviewed
in
the
oregon
case,
which
had
been
cited
in
both
briefs
here
today,
that
case
involved
is
a
situation
in
alaska
where
you
have
seasonal
employees
and
these
seasonal
employees
finished
their
work
in
1939
then
before
the
season
started
in
1940,
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
not
been
negotiated.
there
were
some
attempts
to
prove
that
an
impasse
had
been
reached
in
1940.
and
even
if
negotiations
had
continued
it
would
not
have
been
successful.
this
court
held
that
the
disqualification
of
these
employees,
these
seasonal
employees
from
receiving
these
benefits
even
though
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
been
reached
and
even
though
there
might
have
been
an
impasse
reached
in,
future
negotiations
would
not
have
been
helpful
anyway
that
this
disqualification
was
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
strike
it
down.
secondly,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
gottesman
and
this
is
the
point
that
i
think
that
it
--
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
get
around
and
that
is
the
fact
that
in
all
studies
and
i
think
with
the
approval
of
this
court,
employment,
unemployment
compensation
benefits
will
be
denied
where
the
employees
are
engaged
in
a
strike
situation.
not
true
as
mr.
gottesman
points
out
the
employment
--
unemployment
there
is
voluntary.
the
employee
for
one
reason
or
another
has
decided
not
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
come
into
work.
however,
in
this
instance
where
the
employee
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
the
employee
also
is
contending
that,
“no,
i
am
not
unemployed.
i
was
discharged
unlawfully
and
therefore
i
am
entitled
to
my
job
back,
reinstatement
with
full
back
pay”.
now,
there
is
a
certain
choice
on
the
part
of
the
employee
in
that
situation
and
for
the
florida
board
of
review
to
determine
that
this
creates
a
disqualifying
labor
dispute
does
not
seem
so
unreasonable
to
the
respondents.
in
other
words
if
unemployment
compensation
can
be
denied
when
an
employee
is
striking
and
particularly
if
that
employee
is
engaging
in
picketing
and
supporting
a
strike
which
has
been
held
to
be
a
first
amendment
freedom
then
we
feel
that
there
is
no
basis
and
no
reason
for
saying
that
when
the
employee
voluntarily
chooses
to
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
also
a
labor
dispute
has
been
created.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
also
that
is
not
an
issue.
i
am
interjecting
into
the
argument
for
comparing
the
purposes
only
but
that
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
that
is
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
all
that's
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
no.
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
--
what
i
intend
to
say
is
that
the
strike
case
necessarily
encompasses
this
ruling
rather
than
vice
versa.
i
don't
think
that
this
situation
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
apply
to
reverse
but
i
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
but
i
am
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
which
has
been
held
to
be
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
when
an
employee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
is
engaging
in
freedom
of
speech
activity
then
a
fortiori,
you
can
do
it
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
right.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
right.
we
do
not
think
it
is
so
unreasonable
at
this
time
to
require
the
employee
to
make
a
judgment
beside
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
think
the
policy
and
as
i
say
--
first
of
all,
i
don't
--
i
think
the
strike
situation
would
encompass
this
situation
but
to
reverse
is
not
true.
now,
the
policy
insofar
as
i
have
been
able
to
determine
in
support
of
the
strike
cases
is
that
first
of
all
the
state
wants
to
remain
neutral
and
not
to
be
involved
in
an
active
labor
dispute.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well,
i
take
the
position
that
if
you
reverse
the
ruling
as
a
part
of
florida
board
of
review
in
this
case
that
the
strike
situation
is
not
necessarily
encompassed
in
that
ruling.
now,
the
reasons
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well,
let
me
go
ahead
with
these
reasons
in
support
--
in
connection
with
the
strike
situation.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
there
is
a
particular
burden
on
the
right
to
strike.
i
think
that
--
well
if
there
is,
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable.
the
reasons
behind
the
decisions
in
the
strike
cases
is,
as
i
understand
them
is
that
--
first
of
all
the
state
does
not
want
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
financing
a
labor
dispute.
secondly,
the
employer
should
not
be
put
in
the
position
in
effect
subsidize
a
dispute
involving
his
particular
business.
now,
i
think
going
on
to
this
particular
review
that
the
same
reasons
there
are
applicable
here.
the
employer
is
nevertheless
put
in
the
same
position
if
he
has
to
pay.
secondly,
i
see
no
unreasonable
requirement
put
up
on
the
employee
if
he
has
to
spend
some
time
or
some
--
i
don't
--
by
that
i
don't
mean
days
or
weeks
but
give
some
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
he
in
effect
has
a
legitimate
grievance
before
the
labor
board
and
if
not
then
he
can
go
to
the
state
unemployment
compensation.
i
don't
think
that
the
situation
calls
for
this
court
to
hand
down
a
decision
striking
down
a
decision
of
the
florida
board
of
rewiew
which
was
in
effect
guarantee
the
empolyee
in
what
the
right
to
draw
unemployment
compensation
and
still
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
attack
this
discharge
on
the
grounds
of
union
activity.
i
think
that's
what
it
boils
down
to,
the
fact
that
the
state
can
go
against
the
employee
and
recoup
whatever
unemployment
compensation
benefits
were
gained
by
the
employee.
there's
not
necessarily
at
least
in
my
opinion
eliminate
the
problem
still
places
an
undo
burden,
we
think
on
the
employer
and
also
as
pointed
out
in
the
conclusion
of
our
brief,
it
can
lead
to
three
separate
cases
of
litigation.
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
employee
on
unemployment
compensation
claim,
a
claim
for
back
pay
with
the
federal
government
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
then
in
turn
a
suit
by
the
state
against
the
employee
to
recoup
the
unemployment
compensation
benefits
if
back
pay
is
awarded
by
the
federal
government.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
petitioner
have
sustained
the
burden.
he
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
burden
on
the
state
to
come
forward
and
show
a
compelling
atmosphere.
but
there
is
not
a
burden
on
the
state
to
do
this
until
the
petitioner
has
shown
that
there
is
some
constitutional
question
raised
by
this
decision
of
the
florida
board
of
review
and
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
a
submission
--
issue
to
be
passed
on
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of
inquiry
here
today
is
a
decision
of
the
board
of
review
of
the
florida
industrial
commission
and
that
decision
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
gottesman
is
to
the
effect
that
when
an
employee
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
nlrb,
a
labor
dispute
comes
into
existence
and
therefore
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute
the
employee
will
be
denied
benefits
under
the
state
unemployment
compensation
act
as
long
as
the
charge
or
the
dispute
is
pending.
now,
and
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
i
think
there
have
been
four
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals,
various
court
of
appeals
within
the
state
of
florida
affirming
such
determinations.
as
of
this
time,
there
has
been
no
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
involving
this
particular
issue.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
we
were
anticipating
that
this
case
might
go
there
but
as
mr.
gottesman
has
pointed
out
the
procedure
within
the
state
of
florida
in
this
particular
area
is
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
yes.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
it
is
rather
complicated
and
we
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
oppose
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
because
that
first
--
the
first
impression
that
we
have
was
that
the
state
court
procedure
had
not
been
exhausted
but
then
after
taking
another
look
at
it
while
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
probably
that
it
was.
so
whether
not
the
state
supreme
court
of
florida
will
be
reviewing
one
of
these
cases
any
time
soon
before
the
decision
of
this
court
is
forthcoming
is
not
known
but
it
is
a
rather
complicated
procedure
and
if
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
absence
of
an
attorney
from
the
attorney
general's
office
from
the
state
of
florida
have
no
way
of
knowing.
but
in
any
event,
they
did
not
file
the
brief
but
authorized
me
to
appear
orally
for
the
commission
at
this
time.
so
basically,
that
is
the
problem
before
the
court
and
we
think
that
the
issue
concerning
this
ruling
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
determination.
in
other
words,
is
the
determination
of
the
board
of
review
to
the
extent
that
the
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
for
the
nlrb
unreasonable
not
one
of
whether
or
not
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
this
petitioner
is
violated.
it
is
our
position
that
privileges
and
immunities
has
no
place
or
no
application
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
we
say
that
for
this
reason.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
order
for
that
doctrine
to
come
into
play
and
to
be
an
issue
and
in
order
for
that
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
be
violated,
we
first
of
all
have
to
be
dealing
with
a
right
of
national
citizenship.
now,
its
our
contention
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
group
of
employees,
a
limited
number
of
employees
in
this
particular
area
and
these
employees
must
be
persons
that
not
only
can
go
to
the
state
unemployment
compensation
board
and
file
a
claim
for
unemployment
compensation
but
must
also
be
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
position
of
being
eligible
or
able
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
have
this
charge
processed.
now,
no
right
of
national
citizenship
is
involved.
the
right
or
the
--
in
order
to
qualify
for
both
of
these
positions,
first
of
all,
the
person
must
be
an
employee
and
insofar
as
the
federal
aspect
of
the
situation
is
concerned,
the
person
must
be
an
employee
of
an
employer
engaged
in
an
interstate
commerce.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
citizenship.
if
this
court
held
that
this
rule
was
invalid
because
it
violated
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
would
be
in
effect
holding
that
in
order
to
first
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
within
nlrb
you
would
have
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
this
is
not
the
case
nor
was
this
result
intended
by
congress.
therefore,
we
take
the
position
at
the
outset
that
privileges
and
immunities
is
not
involved
in
this
case
whatsoever.
and
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
citizen
in
this
particular
instance
to
file
or
process
a
charge
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
now
secondly,
the
petitioner
advances
as
a
reason
for
striking
down
this
ruling
of
the
florida
industrial
commission
that
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause
and
in
support
of
this
position,
primarily
relies
upon
two
cases
one
is
davis
against
elmira
state
bank
and
the
other
one
is
hill
against
florida.
now
we
think
that
the
approach
taken
in
these
two
cases
even
if
the
supremacy
clause
is
involved
here
is
not
applicable
and
does
not
furnish
any
sufficient
or
adequate
guidelines
for
determination
that
we
must
make
here
today.
the
elmira
state
bank
case
involved
a
state
statute
and
a
federal
statute
that
were
in
direct
conflict
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
remaining
assets
of
insolvent
banks.
in
other
words,
these
two
statutes
ran
head
on
and
in
hill
against
florida
that
involved
a
statute
that
imposed
certain
conditions
upon
labor
organizations
and
business
agents
before
they
could
decay
on
business
within
the
state
of
florida
and
this
court
held
there
that
the
determination
that
was
being
made
by
the
legislature
and
the
penalties
imposed
such
as
a
complete
injunction
against
functioning
as
a
labor
organization
altogether
did
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
we
do
not
think
that
we
are
faced
with
such
a
situation
here
today.
what
--
rather
what
we
are
faced
with
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
rule.
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it's
only
inquiry
and
it's
only
purpose
in
reviewing
such
a
case
would
be
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
advanced
by
the
unemployment
compensation
commission.
now
i
think
first
of
all
we
have
to
look
at
the
reason
that
these
statutes
both
federal
and
state
were
originally
passed.
that's
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
this
statutes
which
were
passed
back
in
1935,
1936
in
that
particular
area
was
to
alleviate
mass
unemployment
rather
than
come
into
play
in
a
particular
situation
that
we
have
or
that
we
are
faced
with
here
today.
in
other
words,
the
reason
for
this
legislation
in
our
opinion
is
not
present
when
we
consider
what
the
purpose
of
the
rule
of
the
florida
board
of
review
or
the
reason
behind
that
decision.
now,
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
occasions
to
review
various
rulings
of
industrial
commissions.
once
such
rule
was
reviewed
in
the
oregon
case,
which
had
been
cited
in
both
briefs
here
today,
that
case
involved
is
a
situation
in
alaska
where
you
have
seasonal
employees
and
these
seasonal
employees
finished
their
work
in
1939
then
before
the
season
started
in
1940,
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
not
been
negotiated.
there
were
some
attempts
to
prove
that
an
impasse
had
been
reached
in
1940.
and
even
if
negotiations
had
continued
it
would
not
have
been
successful.
this
court
held
that
the
disqualification
of
these
employees,
these
seasonal
employees
from
receiving
these
benefits
even
though
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
been
reached
and
even
though
there
might
have
been
an
impasse
reached
in,
future
negotiations
would
not
have
been
helpful
anyway
that
this
disqualification
was
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
strike
it
down.
secondly,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
gottesman
and
this
is
the
point
that
i
think
that
it
--
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
get
around
and
that
is
the
fact
that
in
all
studies
and
i
think
with
the
approval
of
this
court,
employment,
unemployment
compensation
benefits
will
be
denied
where
the
employees
are
engaged
in
a
strike
situation.
not
true
as
mr.
gottesman
points
out
the
employment
--
unemployment
there
is
voluntary.
the
employee
for
one
reason
or
another
has
decided
not
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
come
into
work.
however,
in
this
instance
where
the
employee
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
the
employee
also
is
contending
that,
“no,
i
am
not
unemployed.
i
was
discharged
unlawfully
and
therefore
i
am
entitled
to
my
job
back,
reinstatement
with
full
back
pay”.
now,
there
is
a
certain
choice
on
the
part
of
the
employee
in
that
situation
and
for
the
florida
board
of
review
to
determine
that
this
creates
a
disqualifying
labor
dispute
does
not
seem
so
unreasonable
to
the
respondents.
in
other
words
if
unemployment
compensation
can
be
denied
when
an
employee
is
striking
and
particularly
if
that
employee
is
engaging
in
picketing
and
supporting
a
strike
which
has
been
held
to
be
a
first
amendment
freedom
then
we
feel
that
there
is
no
basis
and
no
reason
for
saying
that
when
the
employee
voluntarily
chooses
to
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
also
a
labor
dispute
has
been
created.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
also
that
is
not
an
issue.
i
am
interjecting
into
the
argument
for
comparing
the
purposes
only
but
that
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
that
is
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
all
that's
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
no.
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
--
what
i
intend
to
say
is
that
the
strike
case
necessarily
encompasses
this
ruling
rather
than
vice
versa.
i
don't
think
that
this
situation
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
apply
to
reverse
but
i
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
but
i
am
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
which
has
been
held
to
be
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
when
an
employee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
--
is
engaging
in
freedom
of
speech
activity
then
a
fortiori,
you
can
do
it
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
right.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
right.
we
do
not
think
it
is
so
unreasonable
at
this
time
to
require
the
employee
to
make
a
judgment
beside
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
think
the
policy
and
as
i
say
--
first
of
all,
i
don't
--
i
think
the
strike
situation
would
encompass
this
situation
but
to
reverse
is
not
true.
now,
the
policy
insofar
as
i
have
been
able
to
determine
in
support
of
the
strike
cases
is
that
first
of
all
the
state
wants
to
remain
neutral
and
not
to
be
involved
in
an
active
labor
dispute.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well,
i
take
the
position
that
if
you
reverse
the
ruling
as
a
part
of
florida
board
of
review
in
this
case
that
the
strike
situation
is
not
necessarily
encompassed
in
that
ruling.
now,
the
reasons
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
well,
let
me
go
ahead
with
these
reasons
in
support
--
in
connection
with
the
strike
situation.
mr.
glenn
l.
greene,
jr.
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
there
is
a
particular
burden
on
the
right
to
strike.
i
think
that
--
well
if
there
is,
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable.
the
reasons
behind
the
decisions
in
the
strike
cases
is,
as
i
understand
them
is
that
--
first
of
all
the
state
does
not
want
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
financing
a
labor
dispute.
secondly,
the
employer
should
not
be
put
in
the
position
in
effect
subsidize
a
dispute
involving
his
particular
business.
now,
i
think
going
on
to
this
particular
review
that
the
same
reasons
there
are
applicable
here.
the
employer
is
nevertheless
put
in
the
same
position
if
he
has
to
pay.
secondly,
i
see
no
unreasonable
requirement
put
up
on
the
employee
if
he
has
to
spend
some
time
or
some
--
i
don't
--
by
that
i
don't
mean
days
or
weeks
but
give
some
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
he
in
effect
has
a
legitimate
grievance
before
the
labor
board
and
if
not
then
he
can
go
to
the
state
unemployment
compensation.
i
don't
think
that
the
situation
calls
for
this
court
to
hand
down
a
decision
striking
down
a
decision
of
the
florida
board
of
rewiew
which
was
in
effect
guarantee
the
empolyee
in
what
the
right
to
draw
unemployment
compensation
and
still
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
attack
this
discharge
on
the
grounds
of
union
activity.
i
think
that's
what
it
boils
down
to,
the
fact
that
the
state
can
go
against
the
employee
and
recoup
whatever
unemployment
compensation
benefits
were
gained
by
the
employee.
there's
not
necessarily
at
least
in
my
opinion
eliminate
the
problem
still
places
an
undo
burden,
we
think
on
the
employer
and
also
as
pointed
out
in
the
conclusion
of
our
brief,
it
can
lead
to
three
separate
cases
of
litigation.
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
employee
on
unemployment
compensation
claim,
a
claim
for
back
pay
with
the
federal
government
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
then
in
turn
a
suit
by
the
state
against
the
employee
to
recoup
the
unemployment
compensation
benefits
if
back
pay
is
awarded
by
the
federal
government.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
petitioner
have
sustained
the
burden.
he
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
burden
on
the
state
to
come
forward
and
show
a
compelling
atmosphere.
but
there
is
not
a
burden
on
the
state
to
do
this
until
the
petitioner
has
shown
that
there
is
some
constitutional
question
raised
by
this
decision
of
the
florida
board
of
review
and
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
a
submission
--
issue
to
be
passed
on
by
this
court.
thank
you.
