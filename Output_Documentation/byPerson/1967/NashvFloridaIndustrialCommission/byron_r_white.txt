this

what
about

well,
how
can
you
really
simply
distinguish
the
strike

in
this

justice

you
say

you're
arguing

you
can.
you're

supports
your
argument
here,
aren't
you?

we
disagree
with
you
on

say
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
burden
that
then
wouldn't
be
a
fortiori
on
the

that's
this

you
were
just
saying
that
the
right
to
strike
is
a
more
egregious
wording.

well,
there
may
be
a
lot
of
differences

in
terms
of
the
federal
issue
that's
involved,
is
there
really
any
difference,
just
in
terms
of
the
supremacy
clause
for
example,
purging
on
some
federal
clause
or
even
on
the

do
you
--
or
take
the
privilege
of
and
immunity
to
control
here.
(inaudible)
on

you
never

would

that
that's

is
unconstitutional.

you
say
