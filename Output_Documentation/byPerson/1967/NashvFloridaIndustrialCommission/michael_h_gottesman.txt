mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
had
about
with
myringitis
this
week
and
i
seem
to
be
losing
it.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals.
that
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
rule
adapted
by
the
florida
industrial
commission
that
an
employee
who
is
otherwise
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
will
automatically
forfeit
that
entitlement
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
protesting
his
layoff
for
discharge.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple
and
we
think
rather
neatly
demonstrate
how
this
rule
was
going
to
work
in
the
future.
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
steel
workers
union
which
was
the
bargaining
agent
at
her
plant.
they
caught
--
the
bargaining
agreement
came
to
an
end.
the
parties
had
been
unable
to
negotiate
a
new
one.
a
strike
was
called
and
the
petitioner
participated
in
that
strike.
the
strike
was
to
save
at
least
the
flop.
it
was
unsuccessful.
the
company
kept
operating.
and
as
a
result,
after
a
few
weeks
the
union
on
behalf
of
all
the
employees
announced
that
all
of
them
were
prepared
to
return.
the
company
took
back
some
of
the
employees
including
petitioner
but
did
not
take
back
some
of
the
others.
now,
petitioner
made
no
claim
for
unemployment
benefits
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
florida,
as
does,
i
think
every
state
denies
unemployment
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
no
claim
was
made
during
that
period.
but
three
or
four
weeks
after
petitioner
had
come
back
to
work,
the
company
advised
her
that
she
was
laid
off.
she
was
laid
off
said
the
company
because
we
don't
have
enough
work
to
keep
you
busy.
and
so
she
applied
for
unemployment
benefits
and
began
to
receive
them.
this
is
the
typical
case
on
which
unemployment
is
paid.
three
weeks
thereafter,
as
petitioner
saw
many
of
her
fellow
participants
in
the
strike
also
being
laid
off,
she
and
they
decided
that
perhaps
the
real
reason
they
had
been
laid
off
was
not
as
the
company
said
because
there
wasn't
enough
work
but
rather
because
as
a
means
of
retaliation
for
them
having
participated
in
the
earlier
strike.
and
so,
petitioner
and
her
fellow
laid
off
workers
asked
and
got
the
union
to
file
on
their
behalf
the
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
asserting
that
the
real
reason
they
had
been
laid
off
a
month
earlier
and
were
still
on
layoff
was
because
they
had
favored
the
union
and
was
as
a
means
of
retaliation.
now,
though
the
procedures
are
complicated
with
the
florida
industrial
commission
ultimately
held
was
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
received
her
unemployment
compensation
as
she
did.
for
the
first
four
weeks
of
that
layoff
because
as
the
commission
said,
during
that
time
she
did
not
challenge
the
layoff
but
said
the
commission
the
moment
she
filed
that
charge
with
the
labor
board,
she
automatically
disqualified
herself
and
forfeited
any
right
to
further
unemployment
compensation
because
said
the
commission,
we
will
deem
the
filing
of
the
charge
the
creation
of
a
labor
dispute.
and
through
some
artificial
means
that
i
frankly
cannot
comprehend,
we
will
now
say
that
having
filed
that
charge,
her
unemployment
is
caused
by
a
labor
dispute
though
we
don't
say
that
for
the
first
four
weeks
while
she
remained
silent
that
it
was
caused
by
the
labor
dispute.
so
we
have
a
ruling
which
is
a
little
bit
hard
to
square
with
florida's
own
statute
but
of
course
we
can
interpret
it
as
it
will
that
if
a
company
says
you
are
laid
off
for
economic
reasons,
you
are
until
you
dispute
it.
and
at
the
moment
you
dispute
it
the
active
dispute,
the
active
going
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
causes
your
unemployment
to
be
due
to
the
labor
dispute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
that
were
the
theory
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
it
could
--
but
if
that
were
the
theory,
i
don't
even
think
it's
that
because
if
that
were
the
theory,
you
would
disqualify
her
for
the
whole
period
since
what
she's
complaining
about
is
not
all
of
a
sudden
it
became
an
empty
union
layoff.
what
she's
saying
is
the
whole
period
of
my
layoff
has
been
from
my
union
activities.
so
if
the
theory
is
that
she
can't
be
heard
to
contest
what
she
claims,
the
theory
would
have
to
be
let's
disqualify
her
for
the
entire
period.
but
it's
clear
indeed
and
that
that's
not
what
florida
is
doing
here.
what
florida
is
saying
is
regardless
of
why
you're
laid
off,
we'll
pay
you
your
unemployment
compensation
as
long
as
you
remain
meek
and
dazzle
but
the
moment
you
go
to
the
big
fat
federal
government,
we're
going
to
disqualify
you.
that's
exactly
what
they
said
and
that's
exactly
what
they've
done.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
have
--
he
is
called
the
appeals
referee
i
believe.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
examiner
first
issued
a
ruling--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
true
because
the
florida
industrial
commission
itself
affirmed
without
opinion
and
the
florida
district
court
and
appeals
denied
certiorari
which
i
assume
does
not
constitute
a
ruling
on
the
merits
though
it
necessarily
means
under
their
law
that
it
found
no
important
question.
so
in
a
sense
it's
really
an
affirmance,
that's
a
little
bit
different
than
the
test
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
this
court's
denial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
that
there
was
at
the
time,
sir
it
was
--
originally
petitioned
for
here,
the
dispute
is
to
whether
there
was
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
claim
has
not
been
renewed
on
the
merits
now.
we
answered
it
fully
in
our
replied
brief
at
the
time
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
from
the
district
court's
denial
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
only
way
this
case
could
have
gone
further
is
that
the
florida
district
court
had
certified
it
to
the
supreme
court
as
an
important
question
and
it
thought
it's
so
unimportant
not
even
to
hear
it.
so
it
certainly
--
that
is
in
fact
the
case
did
not
certify
it
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
but
the
fact
is
this
case
is
--
the
same
rule
is
being
enforced
in
many
other
cases
and
has
been
approved
in
some
florida
cases
with
opinions
one
of
which
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
here.
now
the
way
the
florida
rule
is
going
to
work
i
think
is
quite
clear.
florida
is
saying
to
the
employees
who
think
they've
been
laid
off
in
violation
of
the
federal
law,
“you
have
a
choice.
if
you
remain
quiet
then
you
will
receive
what
amounts
to
cash
under
about
a
50
bucks
a
week
from
the
moment
you're
laid
off
you'll
get
it
when
you
needed
it
which
is
while
you're
unemployed
or
your
other
choice.
if
you
think
you've
been
unlawfully
laid
off
is
to
go
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
to
be
sure
may
ultimately
reward
you
with
more
money
because
you
will
get
the
full
amount
of
your
back
pay.
but
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
one
is
that
as
this
case
demonstrates,
it
is
literally
years
till
you
collect
from
the
labor
board.
in
this
case,
the
labor
board's
decision
came
down
two
years
and
three
months
after
the
charge
was
filed
and
it's
now
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
you
are
hungry
while
you
are
laid
off,
that
late
arrival
of
the
money
is
not
going
to
help
pretty
much.
and
the
second
problem
of
course
is
you
just
might
lose
before
the
labor
board.
many
people
do.
in
which
case,
by
having
taken
that
gamble
you'll
lose
everything.
so
that
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
that
in
the
future,
very
few
people
are
going
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
they're
in
this
circumstance
in
florida.
only
those
who
can
afford
the
gamble
that
is,
who
have
enough
money
to
feed
themselves
in
the
interim.
and
they
are
willing
to
take
the
chance
they
might
lose
everything
instead
to
take
this
assured
$50.
only
those
people
and
i
think
there'll
be
few
are
going
to
choose
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
the
consequence
that's
going
to
have
on
the
enforcement
of
federal
law
i
think
is
also
quite
clear.
the
labor
board
as
has
been
mentioned
in
the
earlier
case
through
comparison,
the
labor
board
is
not
a
self
enforcing
agency.
it
can
entertain
a
case
and
investigate
a
case
only
when
a
charge
is
filed
with.
if
florida
successfully
persuades
unemployed
people
they
better
not
file
charges.
charges
will
not
be
filed
with
the
labor
board.
if
they're
not
filed
the
labor
board
does
not
have
authority
to
correct
violations
of
federal
law,
does
not
have
authority
to
enforce
the
public
policy.
if
they're
not
filed,
employers
are
going
to
discover
a
very
easy
way
to
combat
unionization
as
the
labor
board
points
out
in
its
amicus
brief.
all
it
need
do
as
unionization
begins
is
to
start
laying
people
off
for
economic
reasons.
the
employees
will
not
fail
to
get
the
message
but
they'll
be
foolhardy
if
they
challenge
so
long
as
the
florida
rule
here
is
established.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
as
the
labor
board
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
florida
rule
clearly
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
we
have
a
national
labor
relations
act.
we
have
a
board
whose
job
it
is
to
enforce
it.
it's
enforcing
a
public
policy
not
a
private
interest
as
is
asserted
by
the
respondent's
brief.
in
enforcing
that
public
policy,
it's
dependent
upon
the
people
who
are
injured
coming
to
it
and
florida
is
preventing
those
people
from
coming
to
it
by
imposing
a
penalty
where
they're
coming
to.
we
think
it's
clear,
we've
cited
many
cases
that
demonstrate
that
it's
clear
that
florida
just
can't
do
that.
there
is
also
a
second
basis
upon
which
we
challenge
the
constitutionality.
now,
with
what
florida
is
doing
here,
looking
at
it
not
from
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
but
from
the
interest
of
the
individual
who
is
putting
this
dilemma.
we
say
that
that
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
federal
government
and
to
ask
for
its
protection
and
to
ask
for
the
enforcement
of
its
laws.
and
that
what
florida
is
doing
here
is
exacting
a
price
for
exercising
that
constitutional
right
which
it
may
not
permissibly
do.
no
--
it's
easier
to
assert
that
there
is
such
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
government
than
it
is
to
say
precisely
where
that
right
comes
from
because
i
think
if
this
case
arose
for
the
first
time
today,
this
question,
the
likely
source
of
that
right
would
be
the
first
amendment
which
creates
a
right
to
petition
the
government
as
it
has
been
incorporated
or
read
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
ironically,
this
question
first
got
discussed
by
this
court
before
the
first
amendment
had
been
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth.
it
first
got
discussed
in
slaughterhouse
cases
in
1873.
and
in
those
cases
in
which
this
court
virtually
read
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
out
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
felt
the
certain
responsibility
to
say
that
there
was
some
content
left
to
it.
there's
some
reason
why
that
clause
was
put
into
this
amendment
and
it
said
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
to
protect
those
rights
which
are
inherently
those
of
national
citizenship
that
relate
to
the
rights
of
the
citizen
with
the
federal
government
itself.
it
then
went
on
to
enumerate
some
examples
which
might
very
well
have
been
to
this
case
the
right
to
petition
the
federal
government
for
the
aid
and
comfort
and
assistance,
the
right
to
inform
the
federal
government
of
violations
of
its
laws,
the
right
to
deal
with
the
federal
government
to
assist
it
in
carrying
out
its
functions.
these
are
the
privileges
and
immunities
enumerated
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases
repeated
in
many
cases
since
then.
and
these
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
things
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
trying
to
do
when
she
had
her
charge
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
it's
true,
i
might
say,
privileges
and
immunities
clause
uses
the
same
operative
verb
as
the
first
amendment
abridged.
no
state
may
abridge
the
privileges
and
immunity.
and
it's
true
that
florida
has
not
abridged
them
here
by
making
it
a
crime
to
go
to
the
labor
board
nor
has
it
attached
the
act
of
going
to
the
labor
board.
but
we
take
it
clear
from
any
of
this
court
cases
under
the
first
amendment
that
what
florida
has
done
which
is
to
impose
a
penalty
which
amounts
to
a
financial
penalty
for
going
to
the
labor
board
constitutes
the
kind
of
abridgement
which
is
forbidden
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
it's
true
as
respondent
contends
that
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
a
privilege,
not
a
right
and
that
therefore
in
large
measure
the
state
is
free
to
dispense
them
as
it
will
to
give
them
to
everyone
or
to
no
one
or
to
classify
them
as
it
would
like.
but
it's
also
clear
that
there
is
one
limitation
on
the
state's
right
to
dispense
its
privileges
and
that
limitation
is
that
it
may
not
condition
the
recede
of
them
upon
the
foregoing
of
the
constitutional
right
or
the
federal
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
arguably
it's
not
because
it's
so
interwoven
with
the
federal
unemployment
scheme
and
some
of
the
money
comes
from
the
federal
system.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
arguably
it's
not
about
the
innocence
that
other
rights
might
be
--
other
state
benefits
would
be
bound
and
that
it
is
interconnected
with
the
federal
law
and
it
survives
because
it
in
effect
behaves
pursuant
to
federal
standards
and
unemployment
compensation.
but
we're
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
to
assume
as
this
court
did
in
sherbert
versus
verner
three
years
ago
when
it
had
another
unemployment
compensation
case
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
denial
of
benefits
was
infringing
on
their
first
amendment
right.
the
court
there
assumed
as
we're
prepared
to
assume
for
argument
that
as
a
general
matter,
florida
can
decide
how
it
wants
to
dispense
unemployment
compensation.
it's
clear
that
florida
could
if
they
choose
--say,
we're
not
going
to
have
any
unemployment
compensation
law.
we
don't
want
the
federal
assistance
that
comes
with
that,
we
just
don't
want
to
give
anybody
unemployment
benefits.
florida
hasn't
chosen
to
do
that,
it's
chosen
instead
to
quite
generously
give
in
most
cases
unemployment
benefits.
and
we
assume
that
it
can
make
certain
classification.
we'll
even
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
it
can
say
people
who
engage
in
strikes
by
getting
themselves
thereby
in
the
labor
dispute
in
which
we
want
to
remain
neutral
shall
be
in
the
class
which
we
exclude.
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
right
but
we'll
admit
that
for
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
what
florida
says
as
to
--
i
think
there
are
48
states
i,
misspoke
earlier,
that
an
employee
who
strikes
is
not
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
while
he's
on
strike
because
for
two
reasons,
really.
one,
he
had
a
choice
of
working
instead
of
voluntarily
unemployed.
and
two,
we
want
to
remain
neutral
in
labor
disputes.
we
don't
want
to
finance
the
strike
by
giving
people
money
for
it.
and
we'll
assume
arguendo
that's
perfectly
legitimate
for
florida
to
make
that
kind
of
classification
or
many
other
kinds
of
classification.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
most
strikes
are.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
say
i'm
willing
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
i'm
willing
to
concede
it
for
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
want
to
concede
it
because
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
case.
we
do
--
we
struggle
very
hard
in
our
reply
briefs
to
say
that
when
the
time
comes
we'd
love
to
argue
that
case.
but
that
case
presents
different
questions
we
think
than
this
one
because
in
that
case,
florida
isn't
singling
out
the
strike
really
and
saying,
“there
is
a
weapon
we
don't
like
if
you
engage
in
that
weapon,
we're
going
to
deny
you
unemployment
compensation
which
we
otherwise
give
you”.
what
florida
is
saying
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
we
don't
think
so
at
all
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
think
so
for
this
reason.
we
don't
--
we
think
it's
a
different
question
for
florida
to
say.
now,
mr.
jones,
you
can
be
employed
if
you
want
to.
nobody
is
keeping
you
from
working.
but
if
you
voluntarily
choose
not
to
work
tomorrow,
either
to
go
fishing
or
to
go
marching
in
a
civil
rights
demonstration
or
to
go
on
a
strike,
whatever
reason
you
choose
voluntarily
not
to
go
to
work
tomorrow.
we
choose
not
to
provide
unemployment
benefits
to
those
who
voluntarily
absent
themselves
from
work.
now
we're
not
penalizing
you
for
striking.
we're
not
taking
away
from
you
something
you'd
get
if
you
didn't
strike
because
if
you
didn't
strike,
you'd
be
working
you
wouldn't
get
unemployment
benefits
anyway.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
well
--
i
believe
that
it
has
a
role
to
play
in
the
strike
case
too
but
what
i'm
prepared
to
say
in
this
case
is
that
whether
or
not
it
does
there
whether
or
not
florida
can
justify
that
distinction
on
the
basis
which
it
would
come
forward
and
justify.
it
cannot
justify
this
distinction.
what
it's
doing
here
is
that
its
saying
to
someone
who
would
otherwise
beginning
unemployment
compensation
because
you
went
to
the
federal
government,
we
are
going
to
reach
out
and
take
away
a
benefit
which
we
would
otherwise
have
given
you.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
--
you
see,
the
difference
is
that
they
don't
withhold
them
merely
because
the
person
goes
on
strike.
if
the
person
didn't
go
on
strike
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
them
either.
and
that's
arguably
a
difference.
i
say
that
we
don't
believe
in
that
difference.
but
we
think,
we'd
--
we'll
be
happy
to
come
here
with
the
other
case
as
soon
as
we
can
get
one.
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
precisely
the
same
issue
as
this
one
and
we
think
here,
the
reaching
out
and
taking
away
of
benefits
that
you
otherwise
would
be
getting
is
more
--
at
least
certainly
more
clearly
than
interference
with
the
labor
act
then
it
is
simply
the
denial
of
benefits
to
one
who
wouldn't
otherwise
get
to
anyway
simply
because
he
engages
in
a
strike.
now
just
one
final
point
and
that
is
to
the
claim
made
in
the
respondent
company's
brief
that
whatever
the
abridgement
of
the
individuals
privileges
and
immunities
whatever
the
interference
with
the
operations
of
the
labor
--
national
labor
relations
act,
there
is
an
overwriting
state
interest
here
which
this
court
should
accept
as
a
justification
for
what's
being
done
here.
at
the
outset,
let
me
note
that
the
florida
industrial
commission
which
is
itself
a
co-respondent
here
and
which
is
presumably
the
voice
of
the
state
has
not
seen
fit
the
file
of
brief.
we
would
think
if
there
were
in
fact
some
compelling
state
interests
to
the
kind
which
would
justify
the
interference
with
the
constitutional
rights,
that
the
state
agency
that's
administering
the
statute
would
have
thought
enough
to
have
come
and
told
this
court
what
they
are.
the
fact
is
indeed
that
there
are
no
such
compelling
state
interests.
none
were
asserted
in
the
decision
of
the
appeals
referee
in
this
case
or
anywhere
up
the
line.
and
the
only
one
which
the
company
having
labored
so
hard
is
able
to
come
up
with
clearly
is
not
the
kind
of
compelling
state
interest
that
would
warrant
the
infringement
with
constitutional
rights.
the
company
is
alleged
compelling
state
interest
is
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
dual
compensation.
a
state
has
a
right
to
say
we
don't
want
to
give
you
unemployment
benefits
when
there's
a
chance
you're
also
going
to
collect
from
the
labor
board
and
therefore
get
double
recovery.
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
concern
is
that
it's
not
a
real
concern
because
this
court
said
many,
many
years
ago
that
if
an
employee
after
collecting
unemployment
compensation
does
get
benefits
from
the
labor
board,
you,
the
state
of
florida
in
administering
your
unemployment
compensation
act
are
free
to
recoup
back
the
unemployment
benefits
you've
paid.
now
the
fact
is,
state
of
florida
since
that
decision
has
not
chosen
to
setup
any
such
procedure.
it
has
not
been
sufficiently
concerned
with
double
compensation
in
the
intervening
15
years
to
have
provided
any
procedure
whereby
it
collects
back
double
payments.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
but
except
that
this
court
has
held
that
you
can't
deduct
from
a
labor
board
award
or
at
least
that
the
board
acted
properly
in
adapting
a
rule
to
which
adheres
that
unemployment
comp
--
will
not
be
deducted
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
--
(voice
overlap)
which
it
could've
done
really
on
either
way.
what
it
said
was
the
answer
is
what
the
state
do
for
--
though
florida
was
told
it
could
do
it,
it
hasn't
seen
fit
to
do
it
in
15
year.
i
suppose
the
reason
is
because
the
number
of
these
cases
is
obviously
so
small
compared
to
the
magnitude
of
unemployment
system
that
it
is
more
a
bother
to
go
collect
back
these
few
dollars
from
a
few
people
and
they
just
forget
about
it.
that
being
so,
they're
not
having
bothered
with
the
15
years,
they're
not
having
asserted
in
this
decision
that
that's
a
compelling
state
interest.
they're
not
having
filed
a
brief
here
to
tell
this
court
it's
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
think
it
sits
rather
heavily
for
the
company
to
come
and
say,
“allow
these
infringements
with
constitutional
rights.
allow
this
disruption
of
the
operations
of
the
of
the
labor
board
because
there
is
this
overwhelming
compelling
state
interest
in
avoiding
dual
compensation”.
we
just
don't
think
any
such
state
interest
exist
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
indeed
it's
opposed
to
--
well
no,
not
in
the
first
instance.
i
gather,
the
company
originally
went
to
the
unemployment
--
when
the
person
first
applies
for
unemployment
compensation,
he
comes
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
after
the
charge
was
filed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
what
happened
here
was
in
fact
and
this
is
what
makes
a
funny
procedure
because
you
know,
the
case
in
which
the
law
is
made
always
gets
somehow
done
retroactively.
minnie
nash
in
fact
got
paid
for
the
entire
period
of
her
unemployment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
then,
the
next
thing
she
knew
was
that
a
month
after
she
was
back
at
work
she
got
letters
from
the
claim's
examiner
saying,
“your
benefits
have
been
redetermined
and
we've
discovered
we
made
a
mistake
and
you
should
not
have
been
paid”.
now
we
don't
know
who
went
to
him,
we
can
give
you
a
pretty
good
guess
that
it's
the
company,
but
we
don't
know
that.
all
we
know
is
that
a
month
after
she
was
back
at
work
she
suddenly
got
a
slip
of
paper
which
said
that
we
have
redetermined
and
discovered
that
we
made
an
error
and
you
should've
been
disqualified
because
you
filed
a
charge
to
the
labor
board.
and
that's
how
this
thing
got
reactivated.
she
appealed
that
notice
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
was
a
hearing
after
that.
the
hearing
is
--
the
hearing
which
appears
in
the
record,
it's
a
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
at
that
hearing,
the
company
counsel
very
vigorously
opposed
the
award
of
benefits
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
company
argued
she
should
be
disqualified
for
the
entire
period.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
adopting
essentially
the
suggestion
that
was
made
earlier
right
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
the
theory
being
that
she
having
claimed
she
was
laid
off,
preempt
the
union
reasons,
that's
a
labor
dispute
and
a
union
reason.
and
therefore,
since
she
claimed
she
was
--
the
whole
period
of
the
layoff
was
for
that
reason,
you
should
disqualify
her
for
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
not
in
his
decision
after
the
hearing.
the
original
announcement
just
said,
you're
disqualified
for
the
entire
year
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
for
a
labor
dispute.
that's
right.
after
the
hearing
that
was
--
the
decision
which
was
finally
written
says,
as
long
as
you
don't
dispute
it
that's
okay,
but
the
moment
you
file
a
charge
with
the
board,
that's
the
labor
dispute.
now
i
might
say
that
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
trouble
here
was
that
they
didn't
take
away
enough.
i
think
it's
equally
--
it
would
have
been
equally
wrong
for
the
state
to
have
disqualified
her
for
the
whole
period
because
florida
has
this
rather
unusual
dichotomy.
if
an
employer
is
foolhardy
enough
to
come
before
the
agency
and
say,
“no,
the
reason
i
fired
this
person
is
because
he
joined
the
union.
and
therefore
this
is
a
labor
dispute.
don't
pay”.
florida
had
such
an
employer
in
1940
was
it
so
and
the
commission
said
it
would
be
outrageous
to
deny
a
person
benefits
when
you
give
and
that
is
your
reason
for
firing
him.
that's
not
a
labor
dispute
if
you
fire
him
for
empty
union
reasons
and
therefore
we're
going
to
pay
this
person.
that
was
--
we
view
that
as
a
compensable
unemployment.
here,
however,
they
say
that
if
the
employee
goes
to
the
federal
agency
and
says
that's
why
he
was
fired
that
he's
going
there
and
saying
that
is
the
disqualifying
feature
so
that
really
was
being
penalized
is
not
the
fact
that
you
were
fired
for
supporting
a
union.
that
it
--
would
be
shocking
enough
as
far
as
we're
concerned
but
it's
quite
clearly
the
act
of
invoking
federal
protection
which
is
the
disqualifying
feature
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
tempted
to
try
it
again
where
i
probably
shouldn't
tread
which
is
the
dilemma
that
mr.
justice
white
has
exposed.
each
of
us
argue
one
thing
for
this
case
and
would
like
something
else
for
the
others
that
are
afraid
and
don't
know
quite
how
far
to
tread.
obviously,
we
think,
it
was
--
i've
indicated,
we
think
the
denial
of
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers
is
also
a
violation
of
law
or
it
is
also
unconstitutional
i
should
say.
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
difference
and
the
question
is
different
and
i
do
think
that
it's
important
to
identify
what
the
difference
is
because
it
really
is
not
essential
perhaps
desirable
for
this
court
to
decide
both
questions
at
once.
and
the
difference
as
we
see
it
is
this,
florida
has
a
general
policy
of
not
compensating
involuntary
--
i'm
sorry,
voluntary
unemployment.
florida
has
a
right
it
seems
to
us
as
a
general
rule
to
adopt
a
general
construction
or
a
general
division
of
its
unemployment
compensation
and
only
those
who
had
a
choice
or
who
had
no
choice
who
are
unemployed
against
their
will
shall
receive
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
but
it's
a
different
question.
the
question
we
have
here
is
the
same
as
that
in
sherbert
versus
verner.
the
difference
is
that
here,
florida
is
making
an
exception
from
its
own
rules
to
reach
this
and
that
clearly
we
think
is
a
reaching
out
to
punish
the
exercise
of
constitutional
right.
the
question
in
the
other
case
is
whether
florida
in
applying
its
own
general
rule
which
is
we
won't
compensate
voluntary
absence,
nonetheless,
though
it
is
a
part
of
a
general
rule
is
so
infringing
upon
a
federally
protected
interest
that
in
balancing
the
florida's
general
rule
against
the
abrasion
of
the
federal
interest.
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
the
federal
interest.
that
issue
really
is
the
one
that
was
involved
in
sherbert
versus
verner
where
the
state
had
a
general
rule
that
those
who
did
--
would
not
accept
available
work
would
be
disqualified
from
unemployment
compensation
but
that
rule
wasn't
limited
to
or
singled
out
for
sabbatarians,
it
was
a
general
rule.
but
nevertheless
when
they
applied
it
to
someone
who
could
not
take
available
work
because
it
was
work
that
occurred
on
a
saturday
and
she
was
sabbatarian.
though
it
was
the
application
of
a
general
rule,
this
court
struck
it
down.
and
they
struck
it
down
because
it
said
that
the
state
interest
involve
were
not
sufficiently
great.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry,
that
it
would?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
raises
the
question
of
the
same
context.
the
context
of
the
application
of
a
general
state
rule
which
everyone
would
concede
is
in
most
instances
alright
to
--
in
a
particular
situation
where
to
do
so
robs
against
the
federal
interest.
whereas,
what
we
have
here
is
not
the
application
of
a
general
rule
but
the
exception
from
a
general
rule
for
the
sole
purpose
of
reaching
a
federal
interest
which
we
think
is
in
a
sense
an
easier
case.
whereas
i
say
we
think
sherbert
and
verner
and
the
approach
and
the
reasoning
there
may
very
well
lead
to
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
deny
unemployment
compensation
to
the
striker.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
had
about
with
myringitis
this
week
and
i
seem
to
be
losing
it.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals.
that
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
rule
adapted
by
the
florida
industrial
commission
that
an
employee
who
is
otherwise
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
will
automatically
forfeit
that
entitlement
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
protesting
his
layoff
for
discharge.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple
and
we
think
rather
neatly
demonstrate
how
this
rule
was
going
to
work
in
the
future.
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
steel
workers
union
which
was
the
bargaining
agent
at
her
plant.
they
caught
--
the
bargaining
agreement
came
to
an
end.
the
parties
had
been
unable
to
negotiate
a
new
one.
a
strike
was
called
and
the
petitioner
participated
in
that
strike.
the
strike
was
to
save
at
least
the
flop.
it
was
unsuccessful.
the
company
kept
operating.
and
as
a
result,
after
a
few
weeks
the
union
on
behalf
of
all
the
employees
announced
that
all
of
them
were
prepared
to
return.
the
company
took
back
some
of
the
employees
including
petitioner
but
did
not
take
back
some
of
the
others.
now,
petitioner
made
no
claim
for
unemployment
benefits
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
florida,
as
does,
i
think
every
state
denies
unemployment
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
no
claim
was
made
during
that
period.
but
three
or
four
weeks
after
petitioner
had
come
back
to
work,
the
company
advised
her
that
she
was
laid
off.
she
was
laid
off
said
the
company
because
we
don't
have
enough
work
to
keep
you
busy.
and
so
she
applied
for
unemployment
benefits
and
began
to
receive
them.
this
is
the
typical
case
on
which
unemployment
is
paid.
three
weeks
thereafter,
as
petitioner
saw
many
of
her
fellow
participants
in
the
strike
also
being
laid
off,
she
and
they
decided
that
perhaps
the
real
reason
they
had
been
laid
off
was
not
as
the
company
said
because
there
wasn't
enough
work
but
rather
because
as
a
means
of
retaliation
for
them
having
participated
in
the
earlier
strike.
and
so,
petitioner
and
her
fellow
laid
off
workers
asked
and
got
the
union
to
file
on
their
behalf
the
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
asserting
that
the
real
reason
they
had
been
laid
off
a
month
earlier
and
were
still
on
layoff
was
because
they
had
favored
the
union
and
was
as
a
means
of
retaliation.
now,
though
the
procedures
are
complicated
with
the
florida
industrial
commission
ultimately
held
was
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
received
her
unemployment
compensation
as
she
did.
for
the
first
four
weeks
of
that
layoff
because
as
the
commission
said,
during
that
time
she
did
not
challenge
the
layoff
but
said
the
commission
the
moment
she
filed
that
charge
with
the
labor
board,
she
automatically
disqualified
herself
and
forfeited
any
right
to
further
unemployment
compensation
because
said
the
commission,
we
will
deem
the
filing
of
the
charge
the
creation
of
a
labor
dispute.
and
through
some
artificial
means
that
i
frankly
cannot
comprehend,
we
will
now
say
that
having
filed
that
charge,
her
unemployment
is
caused
by
a
labor
dispute
though
we
don't
say
that
for
the
first
four
weeks
while
she
remained
silent
that
it
was
caused
by
the
labor
dispute.
so
we
have
a
ruling
which
is
a
little
bit
hard
to
square
with
florida's
own
statute
but
of
course
we
can
interpret
it
as
it
will
that
if
a
company
says
you
are
laid
off
for
economic
reasons,
you
are
until
you
dispute
it.
and
at
the
moment
you
dispute
it
the
active
dispute,
the
active
going
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
causes
your
unemployment
to
be
due
to
the
labor
dispute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
that
were
the
theory
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
it
could
--
but
if
that
were
the
theory,
i
don't
even
think
it's
that
because
if
that
were
the
theory,
you
would
disqualify
her
for
the
whole
period
since
what
she's
complaining
about
is
not
all
of
a
sudden
it
became
an
empty
union
layoff.
what
she's
saying
is
the
whole
period
of
my
layoff
has
been
from
my
union
activities.
so
if
the
theory
is
that
she
can't
be
heard
to
contest
what
she
claims,
the
theory
would
have
to
be
let's
disqualify
her
for
the
entire
period.
but
it's
clear
indeed
and
that
that's
not
what
florida
is
doing
here.
what
florida
is
saying
is
regardless
of
why
you're
laid
off,
we'll
pay
you
your
unemployment
compensation
as
long
as
you
remain
meek
and
dazzle
but
the
moment
you
go
to
the
big
fat
federal
government,
we're
going
to
disqualify
you.
that's
exactly
what
they
said
and
that's
exactly
what
they've
done.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
have
--
he
is
called
the
appeals
referee
i
believe.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
examiner
first
issued
a
ruling--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
true
because
the
florida
industrial
commission
itself
affirmed
without
opinion
and
the
florida
district
court
and
appeals
denied
certiorari
which
i
assume
does
not
constitute
a
ruling
on
the
merits
though
it
necessarily
means
under
their
law
that
it
found
no
important
question.
so
in
a
sense
it's
really
an
affirmance,
that's
a
little
bit
different
than
the
test
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
this
court's
denial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
that
there
was
at
the
time,
sir
it
was
--
originally
petitioned
for
here,
the
dispute
is
to
whether
there
was
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
claim
has
not
been
renewed
on
the
merits
now.
we
answered
it
fully
in
our
replied
brief
at
the
time
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
from
the
district
court's
denial
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
only
way
this
case
could
have
gone
further
is
that
the
florida
district
court
had
certified
it
to
the
supreme
court
as
an
important
question
and
it
thought
it's
so
unimportant
not
even
to
hear
it.
so
it
certainly
--
that
is
in
fact
the
case
did
not
certify
it
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
but
the
fact
is
this
case
is
--
the
same
rule
is
being
enforced
in
many
other
cases
and
has
been
approved
in
some
florida
cases
with
opinions
one
of
which
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
here.
now
the
way
the
florida
rule
is
going
to
work
i
think
is
quite
clear.
florida
is
saying
to
the
employees
who
think
they've
been
laid
off
in
violation
of
the
federal
law,
“you
have
a
choice.
if
you
remain
quiet
then
you
will
receive
what
amounts
to
cash
under
about
a
50
bucks
a
week
from
the
moment
you're
laid
off
you'll
get
it
when
you
needed
it
which
is
while
you're
unemployed
or
your
other
choice.
if
you
think
you've
been
unlawfully
laid
off
is
to
go
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
to
be
sure
may
ultimately
reward
you
with
more
money
because
you
will
get
the
full
amount
of
your
back
pay.
but
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
one
is
that
as
this
case
demonstrates,
it
is
literally
years
till
you
collect
from
the
labor
board.
in
this
case,
the
labor
board's
decision
came
down
two
years
and
three
months
after
the
charge
was
filed
and
it's
now
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
you
are
hungry
while
you
are
laid
off,
that
late
arrival
of
the
money
is
not
going
to
help
pretty
much.
and
the
second
problem
of
course
is
you
just
might
lose
before
the
labor
board.
many
people
do.
in
which
case,
by
having
taken
that
gamble
you'll
lose
everything.
so
that
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
that
in
the
future,
very
few
people
are
going
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
they're
in
this
circumstance
in
florida.
only
those
who
can
afford
the
gamble
that
is,
who
have
enough
money
to
feed
themselves
in
the
interim.
and
they
are
willing
to
take
the
chance
they
might
lose
everything
instead
to
take
this
assured
$50.
only
those
people
and
i
think
there'll
be
few
are
going
to
choose
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
the
consequence
that's
going
to
have
on
the
enforcement
of
federal
law
i
think
is
also
quite
clear.
the
labor
board
as
has
been
mentioned
in
the
earlier
case
through
comparison,
the
labor
board
is
not
a
self
enforcing
agency.
it
can
entertain
a
case
and
investigate
a
case
only
when
a
charge
is
filed
with.
if
florida
successfully
persuades
unemployed
people
they
better
not
file
charges.
charges
will
not
be
filed
with
the
labor
board.
if
they're
not
filed
the
labor
board
does
not
have
authority
to
correct
violations
of
federal
law,
does
not
have
authority
to
enforce
the
public
policy.
if
they're
not
filed,
employers
are
going
to
discover
a
very
easy
way
to
combat
unionization
as
the
labor
board
points
out
in
its
amicus
brief.
all
it
need
do
as
unionization
begins
is
to
start
laying
people
off
for
economic
reasons.
the
employees
will
not
fail
to
get
the
message
but
they'll
be
foolhardy
if
they
challenge
so
long
as
the
florida
rule
here
is
established.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
as
the
labor
board
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
florida
rule
clearly
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
we
have
a
national
labor
relations
act.
we
have
a
board
whose
job
it
is
to
enforce
it.
it's
enforcing
a
public
policy
not
a
private
interest
as
is
asserted
by
the
respondent's
brief.
in
enforcing
that
public
policy,
it's
dependent
upon
the
people
who
are
injured
coming
to
it
and
florida
is
preventing
those
people
from
coming
to
it
by
imposing
a
penalty
where
they're
coming
to.
we
think
it's
clear,
we've
cited
many
cases
that
demonstrate
that
it's
clear
that
florida
just
can't
do
that.
there
is
also
a
second
basis
upon
which
we
challenge
the
constitutionality.
now,
with
what
florida
is
doing
here,
looking
at
it
not
from
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
but
from
the
interest
of
the
individual
who
is
putting
this
dilemma.
we
say
that
that
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
federal
government
and
to
ask
for
its
protection
and
to
ask
for
the
enforcement
of
its
laws.
and
that
what
florida
is
doing
here
is
exacting
a
price
for
exercising
that
constitutional
right
which
it
may
not
permissibly
do.
no
--
it's
easier
to
assert
that
there
is
such
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
government
than
it
is
to
say
precisely
where
that
right
comes
from
because
i
think
if
this
case
arose
for
the
first
time
today,
this
question,
the
likely
source
of
that
right
would
be
the
first
amendment
which
creates
a
right
to
petition
the
government
as
it
has
been
incorporated
or
read
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
ironically,
this
question
first
got
discussed
by
this
court
before
the
first
amendment
had
been
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth.
it
first
got
discussed
in
slaughterhouse
cases
in
1873.
and
in
those
cases
in
which
this
court
virtually
read
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
out
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
felt
the
certain
responsibility
to
say
that
there
was
some
content
left
to
it.
there's
some
reason
why
that
clause
was
put
into
this
amendment
and
it
said
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
to
protect
those
rights
which
are
inherently
those
of
national
citizenship
that
relate
to
the
rights
of
the
citizen
with
the
federal
government
itself.
it
then
went
on
to
enumerate
some
examples
which
might
very
well
have
been
to
this
case
the
right
to
petition
the
federal
government
for
the
aid
and
comfort
and
assistance,
the
right
to
inform
the
federal
government
of
violations
of
its
laws,
the
right
to
deal
with
the
federal
government
to
assist
it
in
carrying
out
its
functions.
these
are
the
privileges
and
immunities
enumerated
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases
repeated
in
many
cases
since
then.
and
these
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
things
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
trying
to
do
when
she
had
her
charge
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
it's
true,
i
might
say,
privileges
and
immunities
clause
uses
the
same
operative
verb
as
the
first
amendment
abridged.
no
state
may
abridge
the
privileges
and
immunity.
and
it's
true
that
florida
has
not
abridged
them
here
by
making
it
a
crime
to
go
to
the
labor
board
nor
has
it
attached
the
act
of
going
to
the
labor
board.
but
we
take
it
clear
from
any
of
this
court
cases
under
the
first
amendment
that
what
florida
has
done
which
is
to
impose
a
penalty
which
amounts
to
a
financial
penalty
for
going
to
the
labor
board
constitutes
the
kind
of
abridgement
which
is
forbidden
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
it's
true
as
respondent
contends
that
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
a
privilege,
not
a
right
and
that
therefore
in
large
measure
the
state
is
free
to
dispense
them
as
it
will
to
give
them
to
everyone
or
to
no
one
or
to
classify
them
as
it
would
like.
but
it's
also
clear
that
there
is
one
limitation
on
the
state's
right
to
dispense
its
privileges
and
that
limitation
is
that
it
may
not
condition
the
recede
of
them
upon
the
foregoing
of
the
constitutional
right
or
the
federal
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
arguably
it's
not
because
it's
so
interwoven
with
the
federal
unemployment
scheme
and
some
of
the
money
comes
from
the
federal
system.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
arguably
it's
not
about
the
innocence
that
other
rights
might
be
--
other
state
benefits
would
be
bound
and
that
it
is
interconnected
with
the
federal
law
and
it
survives
because
it
in
effect
behaves
pursuant
to
federal
standards
and
unemployment
compensation.
but
we're
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
to
assume
as
this
court
did
in
sherbert
versus
verner
three
years
ago
when
it
had
another
unemployment
compensation
case
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
denial
of
benefits
was
infringing
on
their
first
amendment
right.
the
court
there
assumed
as
we're
prepared
to
assume
for
argument
that
as
a
general
matter,
florida
can
decide
how
it
wants
to
dispense
unemployment
compensation.
it's
clear
that
florida
could
if
they
choose
--say,
we're
not
going
to
have
any
unemployment
compensation
law.
we
don't
want
the
federal
assistance
that
comes
with
that,
we
just
don't
want
to
give
anybody
unemployment
benefits.
florida
hasn't
chosen
to
do
that,
it's
chosen
instead
to
quite
generously
give
in
most
cases
unemployment
benefits.
and
we
assume
that
it
can
make
certain
classification.
we'll
even
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
it
can
say
people
who
engage
in
strikes
by
getting
themselves
thereby
in
the
labor
dispute
in
which
we
want
to
remain
neutral
shall
be
in
the
class
which
we
exclude.
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
right
but
we'll
admit
that
for
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
what
florida
says
as
to
--
i
think
there
are
48
states
i,
misspoke
earlier,
that
an
employee
who
strikes
is
not
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
while
he's
on
strike
because
for
two
reasons,
really.
one,
he
had
a
choice
of
working
instead
of
voluntarily
unemployed.
and
two,
we
want
to
remain
neutral
in
labor
disputes.
we
don't
want
to
finance
the
strike
by
giving
people
money
for
it.
and
we'll
assume
arguendo
that's
perfectly
legitimate
for
florida
to
make
that
kind
of
classification
or
many
other
kinds
of
classification.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
most
strikes
are.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
say
i'm
willing
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
i'm
willing
to
concede
it
for
this
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
want
to
concede
it
because
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
case.
we
do
--
we
struggle
very
hard
in
our
reply
briefs
to
say
that
when
the
time
comes
we'd
love
to
argue
that
case.
but
that
case
presents
different
questions
we
think
than
this
one
because
in
that
case,
florida
isn't
singling
out
the
strike
really
and
saying,
“there
is
a
weapon
we
don't
like
if
you
engage
in
that
weapon,
we're
going
to
deny
you
unemployment
compensation
which
we
otherwise
give
you”.
what
florida
is
saying
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
we
don't
think
so
at
all
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
think
so
for
this
reason.
we
don't
--
we
think
it's
a
different
question
for
florida
to
say.
now,
mr.
jones,
you
can
be
employed
if
you
want
to.
nobody
is
keeping
you
from
working.
but
if
you
voluntarily
choose
not
to
work
tomorrow,
either
to
go
fishing
or
to
go
marching
in
a
civil
rights
demonstration
or
to
go
on
a
strike,
whatever
reason
you
choose
voluntarily
not
to
go
to
work
tomorrow.
we
choose
not
to
provide
unemployment
benefits
to
those
who
voluntarily
absent
themselves
from
work.
now
we're
not
penalizing
you
for
striking.
we're
not
taking
away
from
you
something
you'd
get
if
you
didn't
strike
because
if
you
didn't
strike,
you'd
be
working
you
wouldn't
get
unemployment
benefits
anyway.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
well
--
i
believe
that
it
has
a
role
to
play
in
the
strike
case
too
but
what
i'm
prepared
to
say
in
this
case
is
that
whether
or
not
it
does
there
whether
or
not
florida
can
justify
that
distinction
on
the
basis
which
it
would
come
forward
and
justify.
it
cannot
justify
this
distinction.
what
it's
doing
here
is
that
its
saying
to
someone
who
would
otherwise
beginning
unemployment
compensation
because
you
went
to
the
federal
government,
we
are
going
to
reach
out
and
take
away
a
benefit
which
we
would
otherwise
have
given
you.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
--
you
see,
the
difference
is
that
they
don't
withhold
them
merely
because
the
person
goes
on
strike.
if
the
person
didn't
go
on
strike
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
them
either.
and
that's
arguably
a
difference.
i
say
that
we
don't
believe
in
that
difference.
but
we
think,
we'd
--
we'll
be
happy
to
come
here
with
the
other
case
as
soon
as
we
can
get
one.
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
precisely
the
same
issue
as
this
one
and
we
think
here,
the
reaching
out
and
taking
away
of
benefits
that
you
otherwise
would
be
getting
is
more
--
at
least
certainly
more
clearly
than
interference
with
the
labor
act
then
it
is
simply
the
denial
of
benefits
to
one
who
wouldn't
otherwise
get
to
anyway
simply
because
he
engages
in
a
strike.
now
just
one
final
point
and
that
is
to
the
claim
made
in
the
respondent
company's
brief
that
whatever
the
abridgement
of
the
individuals
privileges
and
immunities
whatever
the
interference
with
the
operations
of
the
labor
--
national
labor
relations
act,
there
is
an
overwriting
state
interest
here
which
this
court
should
accept
as
a
justification
for
what's
being
done
here.
at
the
outset,
let
me
note
that
the
florida
industrial
commission
which
is
itself
a
co-respondent
here
and
which
is
presumably
the
voice
of
the
state
has
not
seen
fit
the
file
of
brief.
we
would
think
if
there
were
in
fact
some
compelling
state
interests
to
the
kind
which
would
justify
the
interference
with
the
constitutional
rights,
that
the
state
agency
that's
administering
the
statute
would
have
thought
enough
to
have
come
and
told
this
court
what
they
are.
the
fact
is
indeed
that
there
are
no
such
compelling
state
interests.
none
were
asserted
in
the
decision
of
the
appeals
referee
in
this
case
or
anywhere
up
the
line.
and
the
only
one
which
the
company
having
labored
so
hard
is
able
to
come
up
with
clearly
is
not
the
kind
of
compelling
state
interest
that
would
warrant
the
infringement
with
constitutional
rights.
the
company
is
alleged
compelling
state
interest
is
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
dual
compensation.
a
state
has
a
right
to
say
we
don't
want
to
give
you
unemployment
benefits
when
there's
a
chance
you're
also
going
to
collect
from
the
labor
board
and
therefore
get
double
recovery.
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
concern
is
that
it's
not
a
real
concern
because
this
court
said
many,
many
years
ago
that
if
an
employee
after
collecting
unemployment
compensation
does
get
benefits
from
the
labor
board,
you,
the
state
of
florida
in
administering
your
unemployment
compensation
act
are
free
to
recoup
back
the
unemployment
benefits
you've
paid.
now
the
fact
is,
state
of
florida
since
that
decision
has
not
chosen
to
setup
any
such
procedure.
it
has
not
been
sufficiently
concerned
with
double
compensation
in
the
intervening
15
years
to
have
provided
any
procedure
whereby
it
collects
back
double
payments.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
but
except
that
this
court
has
held
that
you
can't
deduct
from
a
labor
board
award
or
at
least
that
the
board
acted
properly
in
adapting
a
rule
to
which
adheres
that
unemployment
comp
--
will
not
be
deducted
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
--
(voice
overlap)
which
it
could've
done
really
on
either
way.
what
it
said
was
the
answer
is
what
the
state
do
for
--
though
florida
was
told
it
could
do
it,
it
hasn't
seen
fit
to
do
it
in
15
year.
i
suppose
the
reason
is
because
the
number
of
these
cases
is
obviously
so
small
compared
to
the
magnitude
of
unemployment
system
that
it
is
more
a
bother
to
go
collect
back
these
few
dollars
from
a
few
people
and
they
just
forget
about
it.
that
being
so,
they're
not
having
bothered
with
the
15
years,
they're
not
having
asserted
in
this
decision
that
that's
a
compelling
state
interest.
they're
not
having
filed
a
brief
here
to
tell
this
court
it's
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
think
it
sits
rather
heavily
for
the
company
to
come
and
say,
“allow
these
infringements
with
constitutional
rights.
allow
this
disruption
of
the
operations
of
the
of
the
labor
board
because
there
is
this
overwhelming
compelling
state
interest
in
avoiding
dual
compensation”.
we
just
don't
think
any
such
state
interest
exist
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
indeed
it's
opposed
to
--
well
no,
not
in
the
first
instance.
i
gather,
the
company
originally
went
to
the
unemployment
--
when
the
person
first
applies
for
unemployment
compensation,
he
comes
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
after
the
charge
was
filed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
what
happened
here
was
in
fact
and
this
is
what
makes
a
funny
procedure
because
you
know,
the
case
in
which
the
law
is
made
always
gets
somehow
done
retroactively.
minnie
nash
in
fact
got
paid
for
the
entire
period
of
her
unemployment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
then,
the
next
thing
she
knew
was
that
a
month
after
she
was
back
at
work
she
got
letters
from
the
claim's
examiner
saying,
“your
benefits
have
been
redetermined
and
we've
discovered
we
made
a
mistake
and
you
should
not
have
been
paid”.
now
we
don't
know
who
went
to
him,
we
can
give
you
a
pretty
good
guess
that
it's
the
company,
but
we
don't
know
that.
all
we
know
is
that
a
month
after
she
was
back
at
work
she
suddenly
got
a
slip
of
paper
which
said
that
we
have
redetermined
and
discovered
that
we
made
an
error
and
you
should've
been
disqualified
because
you
filed
a
charge
to
the
labor
board.
and
that's
how
this
thing
got
reactivated.
she
appealed
that
notice
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
was
a
hearing
after
that.
the
hearing
is
--
the
hearing
which
appears
in
the
record,
it's
a
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
at
that
hearing,
the
company
counsel
very
vigorously
opposed
the
award
of
benefits
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
company
argued
she
should
be
disqualified
for
the
entire
period.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
adopting
essentially
the
suggestion
that
was
made
earlier
right
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
the
theory
being
that
she
having
claimed
she
was
laid
off,
preempt
the
union
reasons,
that's
a
labor
dispute
and
a
union
reason.
and
therefore,
since
she
claimed
she
was
--
the
whole
period
of
the
layoff
was
for
that
reason,
you
should
disqualify
her
for
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
not
in
his
decision
after
the
hearing.
the
original
announcement
just
said,
you're
disqualified
for
the
entire
year
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--
for
a
labor
dispute.
that's
right.
after
the
hearing
that
was
--
the
decision
which
was
finally
written
says,
as
long
as
you
don't
dispute
it
that's
okay,
but
the
moment
you
file
a
charge
with
the
board,
that's
the
labor
dispute.
now
i
might
say
that
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
trouble
here
was
that
they
didn't
take
away
enough.
i
think
it's
equally
--
it
would
have
been
equally
wrong
for
the
state
to
have
disqualified
her
for
the
whole
period
because
florida
has
this
rather
unusual
dichotomy.
if
an
employer
is
foolhardy
enough
to
come
before
the
agency
and
say,
“no,
the
reason
i
fired
this
person
is
because
he
joined
the
union.
and
therefore
this
is
a
labor
dispute.
don't
pay”.
florida
had
such
an
employer
in
1940
was
it
so
and
the
commission
said
it
would
be
outrageous
to
deny
a
person
benefits
when
you
give
and
that
is
your
reason
for
firing
him.
that's
not
a
labor
dispute
if
you
fire
him
for
empty
union
reasons
and
therefore
we're
going
to
pay
this
person.
that
was
--
we
view
that
as
a
compensable
unemployment.
here,
however,
they
say
that
if
the
employee
goes
to
the
federal
agency
and
says
that's
why
he
was
fired
that
he's
going
there
and
saying
that
is
the
disqualifying
feature
so
that
really
was
being
penalized
is
not
the
fact
that
you
were
fired
for
supporting
a
union.
that
it
--
would
be
shocking
enough
as
far
as
we're
concerned
but
it's
quite
clearly
the
act
of
invoking
federal
protection
which
is
the
disqualifying
feature
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
tempted
to
try
it
again
where
i
probably
shouldn't
tread
which
is
the
dilemma
that
mr.
justice
white
has
exposed.
each
of
us
argue
one
thing
for
this
case
and
would
like
something
else
for
the
others
that
are
afraid
and
don't
know
quite
how
far
to
tread.
obviously,
we
think,
it
was
--
i've
indicated,
we
think
the
denial
of
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers
is
also
a
violation
of
law
or
it
is
also
unconstitutional
i
should
say.
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
difference
and
the
question
is
different
and
i
do
think
that
it's
important
to
identify
what
the
difference
is
because
it
really
is
not
essential
perhaps
desirable
for
this
court
to
decide
both
questions
at
once.
and
the
difference
as
we
see
it
is
this,
florida
has
a
general
policy
of
not
compensating
involuntary
--
i'm
sorry,
voluntary
unemployment.
florida
has
a
right
it
seems
to
us
as
a
general
rule
to
adopt
a
general
construction
or
a
general
division
of
its
unemployment
compensation
and
only
those
who
had
a
choice
or
who
had
no
choice
who
are
unemployed
against
their
will
shall
receive
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
but
it's
a
different
question.
the
question
we
have
here
is
the
same
as
that
in
sherbert
versus
verner.
the
difference
is
that
here,
florida
is
making
an
exception
from
its
own
rules
to
reach
this
and
that
clearly
we
think
is
a
reaching
out
to
punish
the
exercise
of
constitutional
right.
the
question
in
the
other
case
is
whether
florida
in
applying
its
own
general
rule
which
is
we
won't
compensate
voluntary
absence,
nonetheless,
though
it
is
a
part
of
a
general
rule
is
so
infringing
upon
a
federally
protected
interest
that
in
balancing
the
florida's
general
rule
against
the
abrasion
of
the
federal
interest.
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
the
federal
interest.
that
issue
really
is
the
one
that
was
involved
in
sherbert
versus
verner
where
the
state
had
a
general
rule
that
those
who
did
--
would
not
accept
available
work
would
be
disqualified
from
unemployment
compensation
but
that
rule
wasn't
limited
to
or
singled
out
for
sabbatarians,
it
was
a
general
rule.
but
nevertheless
when
they
applied
it
to
someone
who
could
not
take
available
work
because
it
was
work
that
occurred
on
a
saturday
and
she
was
sabbatarian.
though
it
was
the
application
of
a
general
rule,
this
court
struck
it
down.
and
they
struck
it
down
because
it
said
that
the
state
interest
involve
were
not
sufficiently
great.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry,
that
it
would?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
raises
the
question
of
the
same
context.
the
context
of
the
application
of
a
general
state
rule
which
everyone
would
concede
is
in
most
instances
alright
to
--
in
a
particular
situation
where
to
do
so
robs
against
the
federal
interest.
whereas,
what
we
have
here
is
not
the
application
of
a
general
rule
but
the
exception
from
a
general
rule
for
the
sole
purpose
of
reaching
a
federal
interest
which
we
think
is
in
a
sense
an
easier
case.
whereas
i
say
we
think
sherbert
and
verner
and
the
approach
and
the
reasoning
there
may
very
well
lead
to
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
deny
unemployment
compensation
to
the
striker.
