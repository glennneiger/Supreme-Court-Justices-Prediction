mr.
jutice
stewart
all
for
public
drunkenness?
mr.
jutice
stewart
how
hard
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
i
had
thought
that
your
point
was
considerably
narrower.
as
i
understand
the
question
as
verbalized
on
page
3
of
your
brief
that
it
is
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
convict
a
chronic
alcoholic
upon
the
offense
of
public
intoxication.
not
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
arrest
somebody
who
is
publicly
drunk
nor
is
it
a
constitutional
violation
to
prosecute
somebody
who's
publicly
drunk,
but
simply
that
it's
not
constitutional
to
convict
a
chronic
alcoholic
of
that
offense.
and
that
i
would
presume
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
be
yet
opposed
in
a
prosecution
of
somebody
for
public
drunkenness.
he
would
have
a
defense
by
saying
“well
i'm
a
chronic
alcoholic.”
at
that
i
understood
with
your
case
but
i'm
quite
confused
now
with
your
colloquy.
mr.
jutice
stewart
that
might
be
the
practical
result
of
the
court's
decision
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
--
but
you're
not
implying
that
that
is
constitutionally
required
are
you?
mr.
jutice
stewart
all
you're
arguing
is
that
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
defense
to
this
charge?
mr.
jutice
stewart
you're
relying,
in
other
words,
entirely
on
the
eighth
amendment
as
it
might
be
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
that
right?
mr.
jutice
stewart
has
to
--
the
man
has
to
be
both.
those
are
not
alternative
definitions.
mr.
jutice
stewart
he
knew
he
was
confessing.
mr.
jutice
stewart
there's
a
different
definition,
somewhat
different
definition
on
page
10
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
definition
apparently
formulated
by
the
national
institute
of
mental
health
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
of
1963.
mr.
jutice
stewart
well
this
seems
to
be
--
well
is
this
a
different
definition?
a
person
who
is
powerless
to
stop
drinking
and
who's
drinking
seriously
alters
his
normal
living
pattern,
period.
that
is
different?
mr.
jutice
stewart
well
the
texas
statutory
definition
is
different
again.
mr.
jutice
stewart
or,
or
while
chronically
and
habitually
under
the
influence
of
alcoholic
beverages
endangers
public
morals,
health,
safety
or
welfare.
mr.
jutice
stewart
and
quite
a
new
thought,
isn't
it?
mr.
jutice
stewart
but
it
is
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
--
it
is
the
definition
of
this
so
called
disease
in
the
state
from
which
this
case
comes,
isn't
it?
mr.
jutice
stewart
(inaudible)
mr.
jutice
stewart
you're
asking
us,
in
other
words,
to
ignore
or
disregard
the
fact
findings
of
the
trial
court,
are
you?
mr.
jutice
stewart
rather
not
request
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
mr.
jutice
stewart
no.
mr.
jutice
stewart
you
mean
because
of
robinson
against
california,
a
person,
a
narcotics
addict
who
commits
another
crime
would
have
a
defense.
the
defense
that
he
is
a
narcotics
addict,
and
if
that
follows
from
robinson
against
california?
mr.
jutice
stewart
well
what
is
the
behavior
here?
this
is
a
condition.
this
man
wasn't
--
didn't
commit
an
assault
and
battery
or
wasn't
guilty
of
even
disorderly
conduct.what's
the
behavior?
i
suppose
sitting
down
or
lying
down
or
may
be
stumbling.
mr.
jutice
stewart
but
that's
not
criminal
behavior
if
you're
sober,
is
it?
mr.
jutice
stewart
well
he
wasn't
arrested
for
obstructing
the
sidewalk,
was
he?
mr.
jutice
stewart
well
what
was
his
behavior?
mr.
jutice
stewart
it's
a
condition
wasn't
it?
he
didn't
do
anything
that
wouldn't
be
perfectly
legal
to
do
if
he
were
sober,
did
he?
mr.
jutice
stewart
i'm
talking
about
his
case.
mr.
jutice
stewart
it's
not
a
crime
to
become
sick
to
your
stomach
is
it?
mr.
jutice
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand,
this
is
the
vera
study
that
was
referred
to
earlier?
mr.
jutice
stewart
the
vera
institute?
no,
you
were
talking
about
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
that's
the
saint
louis
statistics?
mr.
jutice
stewart
and
this
was
rather
coerced
cooperation,
you
say,
because
it
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
--
cooperated
with
the
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
those
statistics
don't
help
you
do
they
have
to
chose
that
even
with
the
best
kind
of
care
90%
of
the
people
still
can't
help
themselves?
mr.
jutice
stewart
how
can
that
kind
of
a
condition
or
situation
warrant
criminal
prosecution?
mr.
jutice
stewart
if
the
best
kind
of
maximum
care,
still
90%
of
the
people
can't
help
themselves.
mr.
jutice
stewart
how
can
the
civilized
society
--
mr.
jutice
stewart
--
criminally
prosecute
those
to
those
90%?
mr.
jutice
stewart
do
you
see
any
equal
protection
issue
in
this
case?
mr.
jutice
stewart
apparently,
your
brothers
in
the
other
side
are
relying
entirely
in
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
jutice
stewart
out
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jutice
stewart
you
do
see
one
lurking
here,
do
you?
mr.
jutice
stewart
so
do
i.
mr.
jutice
stewart
all
for
public
drunkenness?
mr.
jutice
stewart
how
