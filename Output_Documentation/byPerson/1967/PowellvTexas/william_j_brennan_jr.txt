justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
commitments
there
voluntary
or
may
there
be
some
involuntary
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wholly
voluntary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
so
in
other
words
you
county
authorities
then
cannot
--
no
course
of
procedure
by
which
they
can
commit
them
to
treatment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
has
not
been
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
that's
to
say
then
if,
as
i
understand
it,
if
an
officer
comes
upon
a
person
who
is
drunk,
and
if
there
is
an
ordinance
that
makes
an
offense
--
makes
an
offense
of
public
drunkenness
then
the
officer
may
arrest
him,
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no
he
comes
across
a
person
who
is
drunk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
may
arrest
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
offense
of
public
drunkenness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
and
take
him
to
the
police
station.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
once
he
gets
him
there,
he
may
not
prosecute
him
for
the
offense
--
well
he
may
prosecute
him
for
the
offense
of
public
drunkenness,
but
the
defendant
will
have
a
defense
of
chronic
alcoholism,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
don't
quite
understand
the
relevance
of
many
of
our
--
of
this
discussion
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
take
him
to
a
hospital
first
as
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
want
to
get
clearly
that
you're
not
disputing
the
constitutionality
of
a
public
drunkenness,
ordinance
or
statute
nor
on
its
face
nor
on
of
the
arrest
under
that
of
a
person
who
is
drunk
on
the
street
and
his
prosecution
for
that
offense.
and
you're
limiting
this
solely
to
the
defense
which
maybe
in
oppose
to
chronic
alcoholism.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
mr.
davis,
i
don't
have
any
statistics,
but
i
would
imagine
that
there's
more
public
drunkenness
of
non-alcoholics
than
there
is
of
alcoholics
in
the
sense
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
just
wondering
though
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
of
a
--
what
in
effect
you're
urging
is
that
society
ought
to
come
around
to
the
view
that
the
chronic
--
the
alcoholic
who
was
in
that
sense
has
the
disease
ought
be
treated
medically
and
--
society
ought
to
provide
facilities
and
it
has
to
be
a
public
--
a
burden
because
largely
the
instance
of
this
disease
is
with
people
who
can't
themselves
afford
the
expense
of
the
treatment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
police
can't
disturb
a
person
(inaudible)
do
anything
to
him
except
take
him
to
a
hospital.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
individual
known
to
the
police
officer
already
have
a
record
(inaudible)
drunk
at
the
street,
take
him
in
the
drunk
tank,
and
the
only
thing
that
your
(inaudible)
is
that
they
must
be
under
the
government
policy
allowed
the
defense
of
chronic
alcoholism
so
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
have
--
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
being
voluntary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
a,
i
don't
(inaudible)
is
probably
the
wrong
word,
but
you'd
have
a
powerful
argument
that
you
better
get
doing
something
state
legislatures
because
you
can't
any
longer
convict
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
statutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
40
states
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
cited
in
you
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes!
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
suppose
--
at
least
that
issue
is
not
here,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
conviction
here
is
only
for
public
drunkenness
and
what
you're
now
suggesting,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it
logically
must
follow
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
convict
for
public
--
convict
to
chronic
alcoholic
to
public
drunkenness.
then
it
also
must
be
logically
unconstitutional
to
convict
the
chronic
alcoholic,
who
while
drunk,
commits
a
murder
or
robbery
or
steals
an
automobile
or
less,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
of
it's
an
addictive
kind
of
alcoholism
that
i
understand
from
your
adversary
is
the
issue
that
they
presented.
did
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
necessary
that
would
mean
if
the
addictive
alcoholic
committed
a
robbery
or
a
murder
or
a
rape
while
drunk,
you
suggesting
that
he'd
have
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
were
assuming
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
not
carrying
one
step
further.
are
you
suggesting
perhaps
it
would
also
rule
a
situation
if
he
got
to
the
store,
he
had
no
money
and
he
killed
the
proprietor
in
order
to
get
a
bottle
of
liquor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i've
given
you
the
cause
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
any
ruling
as
suggested
here
would
have
that
necessary
consequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
volitional?
i
understood
it
was
not
--
it
was
un-volitional
criteria.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
commitments
there
voluntary
or
may
there
be
some
involuntary

william

yes,

that's

if

the

correct?

no,
no
he

justice
william

he
may

but
once
