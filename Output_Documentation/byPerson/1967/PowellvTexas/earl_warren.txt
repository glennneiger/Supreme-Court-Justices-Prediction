mr.

chief

earl

are
there
any
institutions
in
the

where
he's
arrested
that
he
could
be
treated
in?
chief

earl
warren
do
they
have
a
program
there
for
treating
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
throughout
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
as
far
as
you
know
there
are
no
medical
facilities
in
the
state
where
a
man
like
this
could
be
treated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
of
course
i
suppose
a
private
institution
where
a
man
could,
but
that's
rather
quite
expensive,
but
i
mean
for
an
indigent
like
this
who
has
the
illness
that
you
claim.
is
there
any
place
where
the
authorities
are
accustomed
to
treating
people
that
kind
or
could
treat
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
has
it
been
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
there
so
many
communities
so
that
don't
have
any
medical
facilities
in
this
day
regardless
of
what
the
humanities
of
this
--
of
such
cases
are?
is
there
any
humane
way
that
we
can
treat
these
people
to
for
instance
to
keep
them
from
staggering
out
into
the
street
and
getting
hit
by
automobiles
or
crossing
in
front
of
a
red
light
and
getting
killed?
there're
so
many
places
in
the
country
that
have
no
medical
facilities
at
all
and
the
only
place
they
could
take
them
would
be
to
jail
and
call
for
a
doctor
i
suppose
to
give
them
some
kind
of
immediate
treatment.
what
are
we
going
to
do
in
all
these
communities
where
the
states
have
never
awakened
to
the
need
for
doing
something
in
this
area
other
than
to
just
lock
them
up
for
48
hours
or
4
days
or
whatever
it
is,
and
then
letting
them
out
to
do
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
him
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
are
you
sure
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
asserted
by
the
police
--
before
the
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
tries
him
for
insanity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
these
situations
and
narcotic
addicts
who
are
obviously
under
the
effect
of
narcotics
publicly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
not
focus
on
the
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
yes,
are
they
always
typically
harmless?
don't
they
do
many
things
that
aren't
very
large
number
of
our
thefts
in
all
of
communities
in
the
country
don't
they
come
from
these
people
who
are
braking
open
cars
and
doing
things
of
that
kind
on
the
street
in
order
to
get
money
to
buy
alcohol?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
all
they
have
to
do
is
go
to
any
police
court
and
see
these
--
a
lot
of
these
people
who
are
often
arrested
for
public
drunkenness,
also
arrested
for
petty
theft
and
things
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
as
far
as
that's
concerned
but
you
said
these
people
do
anything
except
just
be
drunk
in
public.
now
that
isn't
factual
for
my
own
observation
for
many
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
had
experience
of
seeing
police
force
in
cooperation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
in
your
argument,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
right
of
a
policeman
to
arrest
a
man
for
being
drunk
in
public,
that
there's
no
question
about
his
right
to
put
him
in
jail
for
that
offense.
there
is
no
objection
to
his
being
tried
for
the
offense
of
public
drunkenness,
but
that
when
it
comes
to
his
trial
he
has
a
right
to
interpose
the
defense
of
being
a
chronic
alcoholic.
and
if
the
court
finds
or
the
jury
finds
that
he
is
a
chronic
alcoholic
then
he
must
be
treated
medically
instead
of
criminally.
now
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
go
any
farther
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
at
the
outset
if
you
disagree
at
all
with
what
counsel
had
just
stated
in
answer
to
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
because
he's
a
chronic
alcoholic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
a
police
officer
when
he's
charged
with
the
administration
of
law
of
that
kind,
have
a
right
to
judge
the
man's
defense
and
either
convict
him
of
in
his
own
mind
and
take
him
to
jail,
or
acquit
him
on
the
street
even
though
he
is
publicly
drunk
in
violation
of
an
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
raise
the
question
of
constitutionality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
other
than
that,
you
agree
thoroughly
with
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
you
before,
before
you
get
to
what
you
think
would
be
the
result
that
if
we
held
that
alcoholism
was
a
disease
and
that
man
could
not
be
convicted
and
punished
for
being
drunk
in
public.
what
would
be
the
situation
if
he
was
tried
at
such
a
time
for
another
offense
that
required
a
specific
intent
to
proved,
would
it
follow
that
because
he
didn't
have
control
of
himself
to
prevent
his
public
drunkenness
that
he
would
be
incapable
of
mens
rea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
let
us
just
take
a
specific
case.
say
that
the
man
was
a
known
alcoholic
such
as
this
man.
he'd
been
arrested
a
hundred
times,
so
this
time
he
was
obviously
drunk
and
the
ample
testimony
to
show
that
he
was.
and
he
was
charged
also
with
commission
of
a
robbery
at
that
time,
but
if
we
adopted
the
rule
that's
presented
for
us,
would
that
mean
that
he
couldn't
be
convicted
of
robbery
because
he
would
be
incapable
of
performing
the
specific
intent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson,
may
i
ask
you
if
the
state
of
texas
has
a
law
authorizing
the
arrest
and
commitment
of
an
alcoholic
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
do
have
for
that
grounds
alone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
is
it
voluntary
commitment
or
compulsory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
what
the
rule
is
in
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
was
asking,
i
suppose
there're
a
lot
of
these
people
who
are
in
the
condition
of
this
man
whose
case
is
here
today
who
would
much
rather
be
in
and
out
of
jail
the
way
he
is
than
to
be
committed
to
a
mental
hospital
for
a
long
period
of
time.
and
i
just
wondering
what
would
happen
if
he
couldn't
be
convicted
and
a
state
had
no
compulsory
incarceration
in
a
mental
hospital
before
he
comes
before
the
court
and
say
“well,
i'm
an
alcoholic
and
i
can't”
--
no
“i'm
not
an
alcoholic.
i
can
restrain
myself
alright
but
i
just
didn't
do
it
this
time."
and
what
could
the
court
do
if
would
it
try
him
and
find
out
that
he
was
an
alcoholic,
and
if
they
found
he
was
an
alcoholic
they
say
“well
we
can't
do
anything
one
way
or
the
other
to
you.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
--
and
that
is
a
matter
of
concern,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
so.
