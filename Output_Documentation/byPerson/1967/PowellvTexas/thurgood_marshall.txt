justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
--
who
determines
where
there's
a
chronic
alcoholic,
the
policeman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
against
his
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
many
drunks
do
you
think
that
judges
ran
across
in
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
times
do
you
have
this
particular
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would
be
few
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
the
court
that
gets
the
drunks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
saw
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
saw
the
man,
the
petitioner
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
convict
him
without
seeing
him,
wouldn't
it?
he
did
see
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
watched
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
the
benefit
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
haven't
seen
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
haven't
seen
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
none
of
us
have
seen
him,
and
you
say
we
should
disregard
the
court's
finding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
testimony
observed
the
witnesses
too,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
of
the
one
question
on
the
record,
one
question
on
broad
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
extremely
careless
on
direct
examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
$50
fine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
$50
fine
on
$12
a
week
would
be
rather
difficult.
this
man
made
$12
a
week
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
needed
part
of
that
for
his
wine,
so
he
had
pretty
hard
job
to
get
to
$50.00,
wouldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
$50
clearly
punishment
for
being
arrested
for
being
drunk.
that
no
more
and
no
less,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
he
been
fined
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
he
been
fined
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
been
arrested
and
convicted
how
many
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
had
what
effect
on
him
insofar
as
stopping
him
from
drinking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
got
locked
up
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
he's
fined
$50,
so
that
$50
could
not
be
to
deter
him
from
drinking
could
it
in
the
future?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
would
go
to
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
after
he
got
out
of
jail?
his
past
record
would
show
he
would
continue
to
pay.
so
the
only
$50
only
explanation
i
can
personally
see
for
the
$50
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
which
is
punishment
for
being
arrested
for
being
a
drunkard.
justice
thurgood
marshall

this
case?
