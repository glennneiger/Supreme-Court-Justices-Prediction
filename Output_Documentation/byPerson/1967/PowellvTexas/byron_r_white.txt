justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
your
argument
go
far
to
be
saying
that
they
may
not
criminally
punish?
you
must
also
say
that
they
may
not
arrest,
and
unless
you
say
--
well
you
just
say
may
not
arrest,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
if
they're
danger
to
themselves
and
somebody
else,
you
say
they
should
be
taken
to
a
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
--
i
just
said
it's
a
--
here's
a
gentleman
who
maybe
hopelessly
drunk
on
a
street
and
he
maybe
in
danger
to
himself,
his
condition
maybe
dangerous
to
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
awhile
ago
you
suggested
he
should
be
taken
to
the
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
his
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
will
be
--
how
soon
at
the
hospital
may
he
decide
he
wants
to
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
when?
how
long
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
like
48
hours
or
4
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
your
argument
is
that
they
may
not
arrest
them
and
take
them
to
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
just
an
imposition
of
criminal
punishment
is
they
may
not
take
them
to
the
--
take
them
--
arrest
and
take
to
jail
or
even
take
them
to
the
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
just
--
i
gather
your
argument
is
just
addressed
to
chronic
alcoholic?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
to
people
who
are
drunk.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
this
case
there's
not
much
question
about
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
this
person
and
they
don't
need
to
take
him
to
the
station
to
find
out
because
they're
well
acquainted
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
woud
say
they
had
no
power
to
arrest
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let
me
see
if
i
get
your
proposition
correctly.
are
you
arguing
that
constitutionally
states
may
not
establish
a
crime
of
public
drunkenness,
or
are
you
arguing
only
that
if
one
is
a
chronic
alcoholic
that
he
may
not
be
prosecuted
for
the
offense
of
public
drunkenness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
attempts
to
cross
a
known
alcoholic,
a
chronic
alcoholic,
may
he
do
the
same
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
you're
arguing
about
the
constitution,
i
suppose
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
any
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
authority
of
the
police
to
say
in
the
district
of
columbia
not
to
arrest
but
to
--
against
the
person's
will
take
him
to
someone
to
facilitate.
what
is
the
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
and
what's
the
limit
of
--
this
is
of
course
if
think
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
as
a
practical
matter,
what
are
the
limits
of
the
power
to
hold?
do
you
wait
--
do
just
--
do
sober
a
person
up
or
do
you
treat
him?
if
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
just
sober
him
up
then
turn
him
loose?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
is
the
--
be
the
situation
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
assuming
that
you
don't
claim
to
have
a
personnel
in
the
facilities
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
awaken
then
persuaded?
justice
byron
r.
white
awaken
then
persuaded?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
of
them
are
like
texas
and
that
they
haven't
implemented
it
or
funded
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question?
when
you
say
your
argument
is
limited
to
chronic
alcoholic
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
could
you
indicate
what
you
mean
by
that
chronic
alcoholic?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
within
--
it
includes
the
idea
of
addiction
that
alcohol
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
question
of
a
person
who
drinks
a
lot
and
often
and
gets
drunk
often.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
chronic
alcoholism
which
isn't
addictive
or
isn't
--
that
doesn't
represent
addiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
quite
a
difference
between
those
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
just
assume
though
that
we're
talking
about
a
chronic
alcoholic
who
only
qualifies
under
the
last
part
of
that
definition.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
incite
a
state
that
may
have
the
power
to
apply
its
criminal
laws
to
the
alcoholic
who
falls
in
that
ladder
category?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
from
your
argument
that
it's
critical
to
your
case
to
upset
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
basis
of
the
--
that
the
trial
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
basis
that
the
trial
court
stated?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
alcoholism
just
isn't
a
defense
to
some
other
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
suggested
that
if
in
order
to
get
some
more
whiskey
which
he
has
a
compulsion
to
get,
he
got
in
his
car
and
drove
to
the
liquor
store
and
on
that
trip
had
an
accident,
perhaps
this
ruling
would
reach
that
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
i
gather
the
part
of
findings
of
the
lower
court
is
that
appearing
in
public
while
drunk
is
a
recurring
or
unavoidable
symptom
of
alcoholism.
justice
byron
r.
white
spoke
a
lot
of
alcoholics
that
don't
go
out
on
the
public
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
must
be
in
bars,
do
they
stay
at
home
or
somewhere
else?
but
i
think
--
do
you
understand
the
key
to
this
--
the
basis
for
this
statement
is
that
what
they
really
mean
is
the
person
has
lost
his
control,
not
that
his
alcohol
simply
drives
him
to
go
out
on
the
street
rather
than
to
stay
at
home,
because
he
just
losses
his
control
and
he's
appearing
everywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
said,
this
is
a
sort
of
argument
you're
making
then
as
to
the
extent
of
this
holding
that
if
it's
just
the
lack
of
control
that
alcoholism
causes,
then
the
same
argument
would
apply
to
other
crimes?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
your
argument
go
far
to
be
saying
that
they
may
not

you

that

and
unless
you
say
--
well
you

period.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
if
they're
danger
to
themselves
and
somebody
else,
you
say
they
should
be
taken
to
a
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
--
i
just
said
it's
a
--
here's
a
gentleman
who
maybe
hopelessly
drunk
on
a
street
and
he
maybe
in
danger
to
himself,
his

maybe

justice
byron

against
his

justice
byron

what
will
be
--
how
soon
at
the
hospital
may
he
decide
he
wants
to
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
when?
how
long
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
like
48
hours
or
4
days?
justice
byron

white
but
in
any
event,
your
argument
is
that
they
may
not
arrest
them
and
take
them
to

justice

so
it's
just
an

is
they
may
not
take
them
to
the
--
take
them
--
arrest
and
take
to

or
even
take

to
the
jail.
justice
byron

white
and
your
just
--
i
gather
your
argument
is
just
addressed
to
chronic
alcoholic?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
to
people
who
are
drunk.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
arrest?
justice
byron

white
but
not
in
this

there's
not
