mr.
tom
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
move
the
admission
pro
hac
vice
of
mr.
don
davis
of
texas
to
argue
for
appellant
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
davis
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
tom
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
conviction
of
a
chronic
alcoholic
while
being
found
in
a
state
of
intoxication
at
a
public
place
is
prohibited
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
case
comes
to
the
court
in
this
posture.
on
december
19,
1966
the
appellant
was
charged
in
the
corporation
of
court
of
the
city
of
austin,
texas
with
the
offense
of
being
intoxicated
in
a
public
place.
he
was
tried
and
found
guilty
and
he
appealed
the
conviction
to
the
county
court
at
law
of
travis
county
before
following
a
trial
de
novo,
he
was
again
convicted
and
fined
$50.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
county
judge
--
the
county
court
under
these
circumstances
and
in
this
particular
case
being
the
court
of
last
resort
in
texas,
entered
findings
of
fact
with
conclusions
of
law
and
the
appellant
perfected
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
outset
that
appellant
does
not
here
contend
that
article
477
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
as
applied
to
appellant,
article
477
is
unconstitutional
in
that
application.
appellant
being
a
chronic
alcoholic,
afflicted
with
the
disease
of
chronic
alcoholism
who
can
not
resist
the
constant
excessive
consumption
of
alcohol
and
whose
appearance
in
the
public
is
involuntary.
appellant's
story
is
typical
of
the
stories
of
many
americans
afflicted
with
this
disease,
and
i
might
add
many
indigent
americans.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
was
66
years
old,
and
he
had
a
history
of
drinking
dating
back
till
1925.
he
was
injured
on
the
job
in
the
middle
of
50's,
injured
his
back.
he's
been
unable
to
do
heavy
physical
labor
since.
he
drinks
everyday
namely
wine
and
beer.
he
gets
drunk
to
the
point
where
he
passes
out
only
once
a
week.
in
short,
his
drinking
is
limited
only
by
his
financial
resources.
his
financial
resources
are
derived
wholly
from
the
money
he
can
pick
up
shining
shoes
--
excuse
me
--
in
a
local
bar.
this
averages
approximately
$12
a
week.
in
fact,
in
1966,
the
fines
imposed
on
him
for
punishing
him
for
this
disease
exceeded
20%
of
his
total
income.
the
arrest
records
in
travis
county
alone
reflect
73
arrests
since
1949.
this
is
only
part
of
the
story.
mr.
tom
davis
all
except
for
one.
back
in
1951
or
1952,
there
was
one
for
disorderly
conduct,
but
all
of
the
arrest
are
merely
for
public
drunkenness,
excuse
me.
he
estimates
that
in
travis
county
and
in
bastrop
county
together,
he's
been
arrested
approximately
a
hundred
times.
but
again
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
only
a
token
expression
of
evidence
of
the
degree
to
which
this
man
drinks.the
number
of
times
he's
intoxicated
as
he
says
“i've
been
very
lucky
in
avoiding
police
arrest.”
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
he
does.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
tom
davis
the
record
shows
that
he
becomes
intoxicated
to
the
point
before
he
passes
out
only
once
a
week.
the
morning
before
this
trial
began,
he
had
had
a
drink.
he
had
no
more
money
to
buy
any
more
liquor.
but
the
record
shows
he
drinks
each
and
every
day.
i
would
not
represent
to
the
court
that
he
becomes
totally
intoxicated
everyday.
plus
i
don't
think
i
can
justify
it
unless
there's
some
very
benevolent
alcoholic
on
his
team.
he
doesn't
have
the
money
to
get
drunk
everyday,
but
i
think
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
his
man's
alcoholism
and
his
alcoholic
content
was
kept
at
a
very
high
level
each
and
every
day,
it
doesn't
take
--
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
under
texas
procedure
if
you
do
not
have
the
finance
to
pay
your
fine,
you're
imprisoned
and
you
work
it
out.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir
that
is
his
normal
procedure.
mr.
tom
davis
i
believe
it's
$5
a
day,
i
thought
i
was
four
to
five.
it's
$5
a
day.
mr.
tom
davis
the
average
fine
that
the
record
reflects
is
been
imposed
on
mr.
powell
is
been
$20.
mr.
tom
davis
four
days
in
jail,
that's
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
he
has
never
been
institutionalized.
the
record
does
reflect
it.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
tom
davis
no,
travis
county
is
the
county
where
the
state
capital
sits
without
--
travis
county
is
the
county
where
the
state
capital
sits
austin,
texas.
we
have
the
state
hospital.
since
1953,
there
has
been
comprehensive
civil
commitment
legislation
on
the
books.
this
has
never
been
funded,
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
ever
been
civilly
committed
for
public
drunkenness
in
our
county.
mr.
tom
davis
i
would
assume
so.
the
study
that
i
have
appointed
with
from
houston
does
not
reflect
a
practice
of
civil
commitment
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
tom
davis
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
you
question.
no,
there
are
medical
facilities
available.
that
was
my
reference
to
the
state
hospital
in
austin.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
in
austin
there
is
a
facility
which
is
in
the
experimentation
stage.
mr.
tom
davis
about
--
i
was
talking
to
the
director
of
it
about
a
month
ago,
and
they
had
just
got
it
started.
and
they
had
just
developed
--
gotten
the
facility
for
a
halfway
house.
now
this
isn't
a
pure
medical
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
this
is
wholly
voluntary.
mr.
tom
davis
this
is
wholly
voluntary.
mr.
tom
davis
it's
on
the
statute.
there
is
a
statute
where
a
county
judge
on
his
own
motion
can
do
it.
mr.
tom
davis
to
my
knowledge
it
has
not,
and
let
me
be
quick
here
to
add
that
i
would
hesitate
and
be
very
reluctant
to
recommend
wholesale
civil
commitment
of
these
indigent
alcoholics.
and
i
say
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
people
that
have
been
charged
with
the
duty
of
studying
alcoholism
and
its
facets,
the
people
who
are
expert
in
the
area
and
as
reflected
in
the
d.c.
crimes
commission
and
the
u.s.
crime
commission
report.
these
people
recommend
voluntary
treatment.
they
say
it
will
work.
also,
before
the
court
and
cited
in
my
reply
brief
is
a
study
in
the
late
issue
of
the
fbi
bullet,
reflecting
a
pilot
project
in
the
city
of
st.louis
where
on
a
voluntary
basis,
97%
of
the
chronic
alcoholic
stayed
for
the
entire
period
prescribed
by
the
medical
profession.
so
what
--
there
is
evidence
that
voluntary
treatment
will
work,
so
i
hesitate
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
wholesale
program
of
civil
commitment
is
desirable.
mr.
tom
davis
should
be
taken
to
a
medical
facility.
the
man
is
laying
on
a
street
suffering
from
an
epileptic
seizure,
the
police
don't
pick
him
up
and
take
to
the
jail.
he's
suffering
from
a
disease.
now
maybe
under
some
mistake,
the
police
might,
but
if
a
drunk
is
laying
on
the
street
--
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
police
have
two
duties.
of
course
they
have
a
duty
to
enforce
the
crimes,
but
they
also
have
a
charge
with
the
duty
to
protect
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
citizen
of
the
community.
now
certainly
there's
no
false
arrest
by
pick
up
a
--
assuming
i'm
a
police
officer.
if
i
pick
up
a
heart
attack
victim
and
took
him
to
a
medical
facility
for
treatment,
neither
can
every
false
arrest
if
i
picked
up
a
chronic
alcoholic
who
is
in
a
drunken
stupor
wondering
down
the
street.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
don't
think
the
person
in
that
condition
can
make
that
judgment.
mr.
tom
davis
again,
i
believe
the
power
of
the
police
extends
to
protect
the
health
of
the
public
citizens.
mr.
tom
davis
it
isn't
once
we
accept
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease.
mr.
tom
davis
i
read
a
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
excuse
me.
i
think
was
overstating
my
case
to
you
--
a
more
narrower
question
that
i
had
anticipated.
no,
unless
a
chronic
alcoholic
is
in
such
a
condition
that
he's
a
danger
to
somebody,
i
see
no
purpose
in
picking
him
up,
unless
it's
just
to
take
him
as
you
would
for
any
one
suffering
to
some
place
where
he
could
get
help.
but
here
again
let
me
emphasize,
it's
the
medical
facility
where
he
should
be
taken
not
the
police
station.
mr.
tom
davis
there
can
be
no
question
that
there's
going
to
be
some
temporary
dislocations
where
this
court
to
hold
down.
you
can
not
criminally
punish
for
a
disease
or
for
involuntary
exhibiting
its
symptoms
in
public.
mr.
tom
davis
there
will
be
temporary
dislocations.
mr.
tom
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
no.
i
do
not
say
that
if
they're
involved
in
some
other
anti-social
behavior
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
tom
davis
once
again,
i
don't
think
a
person
in
that
condition
can
rationally
refuse
medical
health.
i
don't
think
he
can
make
a
rational
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
when
they
sober
him
up.
mr.
tom
davis
whatever
it
takes
medically
to
--
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
takes
that
long.
i
really
don't.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
well,
we
need
to
differentiate
between
two
classes
here
of
people
here.
first
of
all,
the
known
alcoholic
--
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
point
out.
there's
going
to
be
many,
many
instances.
the
police
obviously
can
not
make
a
diagnosis
of
chronic
alcoholism
on
the
street.
he
will
take
him
to
the
station.
mr.
tom
davis
to
the
station.
mr.
tom
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
yes.
i
don't
think
we
can
charge
the
police
with
the
duty
of
being
able
to
make
a
diagnosis
for
chronic
alcoholism,
but
when
his
disease
condition
comes
to
light,
and
in
many,
many
instances
this
is
going
to
come
to
light
at
booking
desk.
mr.
tom
davis
there's
no
question
at
all
about
it.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
right.
mr.
tom
davis
unless
in
the
sense
to
take
in
for
punishment.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
right.
that
is
what
i
--
mr.
tom
davis
now,
do
i
understand
you're
purposing
this,
he
comes
across
and
know
him
chronic
alcoholic?
mr.
tom
davis
who
is
drunk,
okay.
mr.
tom
davis
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
i
think
we're
focusing
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
we're
focusing
on
a
very
narrow
part.
what
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
our
society
doesn't
let
us
or
doesn't
permit
us
to
punish
for
suffering
from
a
disease.
what
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
at
here,
society
is
punishable
for
exhibiting
the
symptom
of
that
disease.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
very
narrow
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
certainly
we
would
hold
that
he
would
pick
him
up
and
take
him
to
a
health
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
constitutionally,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
false
arrest,
because
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago
to
the
answer
justice
fortas'
question,
they
have
a
power
not
only
to
enforce
the
rules,
but
also
to
protect
the
health
of
the
citizens.
now
certainly
when
they
pick
up
a
person
if
he
is
of
a
danger
to
himself
and
takes
him
to
a
health
facility,
surely
that
could
not
be
constitutionally
attacked.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
tom
davis
i
am
not
saying
the
police
have
the
power
to
arrest.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
it
this
way.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
it
this
way.
let's
look
at
an
insane
person.
what
does
the
police
do
there?
mr.
tom
davis
if
a
man
is
insane
and
he's
out
in
public,
they
pick
him
up
and
they
take
him
to
the
health
facility.
they
don't
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
tom
davis
well
the
defense
of
insanity
is
raised.
mr.
tom
davis
the
defense
of
insanity
is
raised
quite
a
bit.
mr.
tom
davis
no.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
defense
of
insanity
is
raised
is
a
defense
to
many
crimes.
but
we're
talking
here
about
an
insane
person.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
i
do
too.
mr.
tom
davis
i
do
too.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
it's
not.
it
goes
too
far.
what
we're
trying
to
do
here
basically
is
to
transfer
what
is
a
medical
problem
to
the
public
health
facilities.
get
it
out
in
a
way
that
the
criminal
courts
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
i
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
i
do.
i
don't
think
the
conclusion
is
compelled
by
the
analysis.
i
do
believe
that
what
we're
after
and
i
don't
say
to
the
court
that
it's
the
police
should
take
all
drunks
to
the
police
station,
i
do
not
say
that.
and
i
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
they
can
and
should
take
chronic
alcoholics
to
the
police
station.
what
i
was
saying
was
that
if
they
know
a
man
is
chronic
alcoholic
take
him
to
the
medical
facility.
if
it
comes
to
light
placed
at
the
booking
desk
that
he's
got
a
history
of
500
arrests
which
is
common
in
this
country,
immediately
transfer
him
to
a
medical
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
i'm
talking
of
practical
application.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct
and
i
confused
the
issue
by
talking
practicalities
of
how
we
get
to
that
point,
is
what
i
did.
mr.
tom
davis
i
think
that's
correct,
but
here
is
the
point.
there
is
no
justification
for
criminally
punish
a
chronic
alcoholic.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct,
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
that
of
course
is
a
difficult
question
and
it's
--
i
think
we
can
talk
about
it
in
general
conclusion
but
we
don't
focus
on
the
issues.
now
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
focusing
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
let's
focus
on
the
issue.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
do.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
the
issues.
if
a
person
were
proved
to
be
an
addict,
he
was
proved
to
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
disease
if
his
use
of
narcotics
was
involuntary
and
if
he
was
picked
up
for
using
narcotics
in
a
situation
where
the
fact
showed
he
was
not
peddling
it
or
he
was
not
involved
in
any
other
social
behavior,
then
i
think
the
court
could
conclude
under
those
circumstances
that
the
law
is
punishing
him
for
a
symptom
of
his
disease.
i
don't
think
it's
compelled.
i
think
the
court
may
very
well
draw
a
terrible
distinction
between
conduct
where
the
social
consequences
are
so
great
as
in
narcotics
use,
and
in
conduct
such
as
this
where
it's
chronic
alcoholism.
these
people
are
typically
harmless.
they're
non-belligerent
and
passive
--
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
all
i
can
do
is
cite
the
authorities
to
the
court
which
i'm
familiar
with.
the
president
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
justice
concluded
and
i
cite
in
my
brief,
there
are
as
yet
no
data
that
demonstrate
that
alcoholism
is
a
significant
factor
in
the
commission
of
crimes.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
it's
important
here
that
i
distinguish
what
a
person,
an
alcoholic,
even
if
he
is
a
chronic
alcoholic.
if
he's
being
in
--
if
he's
involved
in
anti-social
behavior,
certainly
we
have
the
power
to
civilly
commit
him,
so
society
will
be
protected
in
any
event.
mr.
tom
davis
i
don't
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
point
for
me
to
defer
to
the
amicus
counsel
who
will
state
in
some
detail
exactly
what
the
court
is
positioned
on
right
now.
so
with
that
in
mind,
i
will
at
this
time
defer
to
the
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
for
the
crime
of
public
intoxication.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
he
would.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir
and
i
think
it's
wholly
applicable
to
alcoholism
too.
my
earlier
discussion
simply
got
off
at
my
fault
on
the
practicalities
of
what
we
want
in
the
future.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
tom
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
move
the
admission
pro
hac
vice
of
mr.
don
davis
of
texas
to
argue
for
appellant
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
davis
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
tom
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
conviction
of
a
chronic
alcoholic
while
being
found
in
a
state
of
intoxication
at
a
public
place
is
prohibited
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
case
comes
to
the
court
in
this
posture.
on
december
19,
1966
the
appellant
was
charged
in
the
corporation
of
court
of
the
city
of
austin,
texas
with
the
offense
of
being
intoxicated
in
a
public
place.
he
was
tried
and
found
guilty
and
he
appealed
the
conviction
to
the
county
court
at
law
of
travis
county
before
following
a
trial
de
novo,
he
was
again
convicted
and
fined
$50.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
county
judge
--
the
county
court
under
these
circumstances
and
in
this
particular
case
being
the
court
of
last
resort
in
texas,
entered
findings
of
fact
with
conclusions
of
law
and
the
appellant
perfected
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
outset
that
appellant
does
not
here
contend
that
article
477
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
as
applied
to
appellant,
article
477
is
unconstitutional
in
that
application.
appellant
being
a
chronic
alcoholic,
afflicted
with
the
disease
of
chronic
alcoholism
who
can
not
resist
the
constant
excessive
consumption
of
alcohol
and
whose
appearance
in
the
public
is
involuntary.
appellant's
story
is
typical
of
the
stories
of
many
americans
afflicted
with
this
disease,
and
i
might
add
many
indigent
americans.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
was
66
years
old,
and
he
had
a
history
of
drinking
dating
back
till
1925.
he
was
injured
on
the
job
in
the
middle
of
50's,
injured
his
back.
he's
been
unable
to
do
heavy
physical
labor
since.
he
drinks
everyday
namely
wine
and
beer.
he
gets
drunk
to
the
point
where
he
passes
out
only
once
a
week.
in
short,
his
drinking
is
limited
only
by
his
financial
resources.
his
financial
resources
are
derived
wholly
from
the
money
he
can
pick
up
shining
shoes
--
excuse
me
--
in
a
local
bar.
this
averages
approximately
$12
a
week.
in
fact,
in
1966,
the
fines
imposed
on
him
for
punishing
him
for
this
disease
exceeded
20%
of
his
total
income.
the
arrest
records
in
travis
county
alone
reflect
73
arrests
since
1949.
this
is
only
part
of
the
story.
mr.
tom
davis
all
except
for
one.
back
in
1951
or
1952,
there
was
one
for
disorderly
conduct,
but
all
of
the
arrest
are
merely
for
public
drunkenness,
excuse
me.
he
estimates
that
in
travis
county
and
in
bastrop
county
together,
he's
been
arrested
approximately
a
hundred
times.
but
again
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
only
a
token
expression
of
evidence
of
the
degree
to
which
this
man
drinks.the
number
of
times
he's
intoxicated
as
he
says
“i've
been
very
lucky
in
avoiding
police
arrest.”
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
he
does.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
tom
davis
the
record
shows
that
he
becomes
intoxicated
to
the
point
before
he
passes
out
only
once
a
week.
the
morning
before
this
trial
began,
he
had
had
a
drink.
he
had
no
more
money
to
buy
any
more
liquor.
but
the
record
shows
he
drinks
each
and
every
day.
i
would
not
represent
to
the
court
that
he
becomes
totally
intoxicated
everyday.
plus
i
don't
think
i
can
justify
it
unless
there's
some
very
benevolent
alcoholic
on
his
team.
he
doesn't
have
the
money
to
get
drunk
everyday,
but
i
think
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
his
man's
alcoholism
and
his
alcoholic
content
was
kept
at
a
very
high
level
each
and
every
day,
it
doesn't
take
--
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
under
texas
procedure
if
you
do
not
have
the
finance
to
pay
your
fine,
you're
imprisoned
and
you
work
it
out.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir
that
is
his
normal
procedure.
mr.
tom
davis
i
believe
it's
$5
a
day,
i
thought
i
was
four
to
five.
it's
$5
a
day.
mr.
tom
davis
the
average
fine
that
the
record
reflects
is
been
imposed
on
mr.
powell
is
been
$20.
mr.
tom
davis
four
days
in
jail,
that's
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
he
has
never
been
institutionalized.
the
record
does
reflect
it.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
tom
davis
no,
travis
county
is
the
county
where
the
state
capital
sits
without
--
travis
county
is
the
county
where
the
state
capital
sits
austin,
texas.
we
have
the
state
hospital.
since
1953,
there
has
been
comprehensive
civil
commitment
legislation
on
the
books.
this
has
never
been
funded,
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
ever
been
civilly
committed
for
public
drunkenness
in
our
county.
mr.
tom
davis
i
would
assume
so.
the
study
that
i
have
appointed
with
from
houston
does
not
reflect
a
practice
of
civil
commitment
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
tom
davis
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
you
question.
no,
there
are
medical
facilities
available.
that
was
my
reference
to
the
state
hospital
in
austin.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
in
austin
there
is
a
facility
which
is
in
the
experimentation
stage.
mr.
tom
davis
about
--
i
was
talking
to
the
director
of
it
about
a
month
ago,
and
they
had
just
got
it
started.
and
they
had
just
developed
--
gotten
the
facility
for
a
halfway
house.
now
this
isn't
a
pure
medical
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
this
is
wholly
voluntary.
mr.
tom
davis
this
is
wholly
voluntary.
mr.
tom
davis
it's
on
the
statute.
there
is
a
statute
where
a
county
judge
on
his
own
motion
can
do
it.
mr.
tom
davis
to
my
knowledge
it
has
not,
and
let
me
be
quick
here
to
add
that
i
would
hesitate
and
be
very
reluctant
to
recommend
wholesale
civil
commitment
of
these
indigent
alcoholics.
and
i
say
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
people
that
have
been
charged
with
the
duty
of
studying
alcoholism
and
its
facets,
the
people
who
are
expert
in
the
area
and
as
reflected
in
the
d.c.
crimes
commission
and
the
u.s.
crime
commission
report.
these
people
recommend
voluntary
treatment.
they
say
it
will
work.
also,
before
the
court
and
cited
in
my
reply
brief
is
a
study
in
the
late
issue
of
the
fbi
bullet,
reflecting
a
pilot
project
in
the
city
of
st.louis
where
on
a
voluntary
basis,
97%
of
the
chronic
alcoholic
stayed
for
the
entire
period
prescribed
by
the
medical
profession.
so
what
--
there
is
evidence
that
voluntary
treatment
will
work,
so
i
hesitate
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
wholesale
program
of
civil
commitment
is
desirable.
mr.
tom
davis
should
be
taken
to
a
medical
facility.
the
man
is
laying
on
a
street
suffering
from
an
epileptic
seizure,
the
police
don't
pick
him
up
and
take
to
the
jail.
he's
suffering
from
a
disease.
now
maybe
under
some
mistake,
the
police
might,
but
if
a
drunk
is
laying
on
the
street
--
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
police
have
two
duties.
of
course
they
have
a
duty
to
enforce
the
crimes,
but
they
also
have
a
charge
with
the
duty
to
protect
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
citizen
of
the
community.
now
certainly
there's
no
false
arrest
by
pick
up
a
--
assuming
i'm
a
police
officer.
if
i
pick
up
a
heart
attack
victim
and
took
him
to
a
medical
facility
for
treatment,
neither
can
every
false
arrest
if
i
picked
up
a
chronic
alcoholic
who
is
in
a
drunken
stupor
wondering
down
the
street.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
don't
think
the
person
in
that
condition
can
make
that
judgment.
mr.
tom
davis
again,
i
believe
the
power
of
the
police
extends
to
protect
the
health
of
the
public
citizens.
mr.
tom
davis
it
isn't
once
we
accept
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease.
mr.
tom
davis
i
read
a
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
excuse
me.
i
think
was
overstating
my
case
to
you
--
a
more
narrower
question
that
i
had
anticipated.
no,
unless
a
chronic
alcoholic
is
in
such
a
condition
that
he's
a
danger
to
somebody,
i
see
no
purpose
in
picking
him
up,
unless
it's
just
to
take
him
as
you
would
for
any
one
suffering
to
some
place
where
he
could
get
help.
but
here
again
let
me
emphasize,
it's
the
medical
facility
where
he
should
be
taken
not
the
police
station.
mr.
tom
davis
there
can
be
no
question
that
there's
going
to
be
some
temporary
dislocations
where
this
court
to
hold
down.
you
can
not
criminally
punish
for
a
disease
or
for
involuntary
exhibiting
its
symptoms
in
public.
mr.
tom
davis
there
will
be
temporary
dislocations.
mr.
tom
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
no.
i
do
not
say
that
if
they're
involved
in
some
other
anti-social
behavior
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
tom
davis
once
again,
i
don't
think
a
person
in
that
condition
can
rationally
refuse
medical
health.
i
don't
think
he
can
make
a
rational
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
when
they
sober
him
up.
mr.
tom
davis
whatever
it
takes
medically
to
--
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
takes
that
long.
i
really
don't.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
well,
we
need
to
differentiate
between
two
classes
here
of
people
here.
first
of
all,
the
known
alcoholic
--
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
point
out.
there's
going
to
be
many,
many
instances.
the
police
obviously
can
not
make
a
diagnosis
of
chronic
alcoholism
on
the
street.
he
will
take
him
to
the
station.
mr.
tom
davis
to
the
station.
mr.
tom
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
yes.
i
don't
think
we
can
charge
the
police
with
the
duty
of
being
able
to
make
a
diagnosis
for
chronic
alcoholism,
but
when
his
disease
condition
comes
to
light,
and
in
many,
many
instances
this
is
going
to
come
to
light
at
booking
desk.
mr.
tom
davis
there's
no
question
at
all
about
it.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
right.
mr.
tom
davis
unless
in
the
sense
to
take
in
for
punishment.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
right.
that
is
what
i
--
mr.
tom
davis
now,
do
i
understand
you're
purposing
this,
he
comes
across
and
know
him
chronic
alcoholic?
mr.
tom
davis
who
is
drunk,
okay.
mr.
tom
davis
yes.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
i
think
we're
focusing
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
we're
focusing
on
a
very
narrow
part.
what
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
our
society
doesn't
let
us
or
doesn't
permit
us
to
punish
for
suffering
from
a
disease.
what
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
at
here,
society
is
punishable
for
exhibiting
the
symptom
of
that
disease.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
very
narrow
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
certainly
we
would
hold
that
he
would
pick
him
up
and
take
him
to
a
health
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
constitutionally,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
false
arrest,
because
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago
to
the
answer
justice
fortas'
question,
they
have
a
power
not
only
to
enforce
the
rules,
but
also
to
protect
the
health
of
the
citizens.
now
certainly
when
they
pick
up
a
person
if
he
is
of
a
danger
to
himself
and
takes
him
to
a
health
facility,
surely
that
could
not
be
constitutionally
attacked.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
tom
davis
i
am
not
saying
the
police
have
the
power
to
arrest.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
it
this
way.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
it
this
way.
let's
look
at
an
insane
person.
what
does
the
police
do
there?
mr.
tom
davis
if
a
man
is
insane
and
he's
out
in
public,
they
pick
him
up
and
they
take
him
to
the
health
facility.
they
don't
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
tom
davis
well
the
defense
of
insanity
is
raised.
mr.
tom
davis
the
defense
of
insanity
is
raised
quite
a
bit.
mr.
tom
davis
no.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
defense
of
insanity
is
raised
is
a
defense
to
many
crimes.
but
we're
talking
here
about
an
insane
person.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
i
do
too.
mr.
tom
davis
i
do
too.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
it's
not.
it
goes
too
far.
what
we're
trying
to
do
here
basically
is
to
transfer
what
is
a
medical
problem
to
the
public
health
facilities.
get
it
out
in
a
way
that
the
criminal
courts
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
i
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
i
do.
i
don't
think
the
conclusion
is
compelled
by
the
analysis.
i
do
believe
that
what
we're
after
and
i
don't
say
to
the
court
that
it's
the
police
should
take
all
drunks
to
the
police
station,
i
do
not
say
that.
and
i
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
they
can
and
should
take
chronic
alcoholics
to
the
police
station.
what
i
was
saying
was
that
if
they
know
a
man
is
chronic
alcoholic
take
him
to
the
medical
facility.
if
it
comes
to
light
placed
at
the
booking
desk
that
he's
got
a
history
of
500
arrests
which
is
common
in
this
country,
immediately
transfer
him
to
a
medical
facility.
mr.
tom
davis
no,
i'm
talking
of
practical
application.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct
and
i
confused
the
issue
by
talking
practicalities
of
how
we
get
to
that
point,
is
what
i
did.
mr.
tom
davis
i
think
that's
correct,
but
here
is
the
point.
there
is
no
justification
for
criminally
punish
a
chronic
alcoholic.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct,
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
that
of
course
is
a
difficult
question
and
it's
--
i
think
we
can
talk
about
it
in
general
conclusion
but
we
don't
focus
on
the
issues.
now
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
focusing
--
mr.
tom
davis
--
let's
focus
on
the
issue.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
do.
mr.
tom
davis
let's
focus
on
the
issues.
if
a
person
were
proved
to
be
an
addict,
he
was
proved
to
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
disease
if
his
use
of
narcotics
was
involuntary
and
if
he
was
picked
up
for
using
narcotics
in
a
situation
where
the
fact
showed
he
was
not
peddling
it
or
he
was
not
involved
in
any
other
social
behavior,
then
i
think
the
court
could
conclude
under
those
circumstances
that
the
law
is
punishing
him
for
a
symptom
of
his
disease.
i
don't
think
it's
compelled.
i
think
the
court
may
very
well
draw
a
terrible
distinction
between
conduct
where
the
social
consequences
are
so
great
as
in
narcotics
use,
and
in
conduct
such
as
this
where
it's
chronic
alcoholism.
these
people
are
typically
harmless.
they're
non-belligerent
and
passive
--
mr.
tom
davis
your
honor,
all
i
can
do
is
cite
the
authorities
to
the
court
which
i'm
familiar
with.
the
president
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
justice
concluded
and
i
cite
in
my
brief,
there
are
as
yet
no
data
that
demonstrate
that
alcoholism
is
a
significant
factor
in
the
commission
of
crimes.
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
it's
important
here
that
i
distinguish
what
a
person,
an
alcoholic,
even
if
he
is
a
chronic
alcoholic.
if
he's
being
in
--
if
he's
involved
in
anti-social
behavior,
certainly
we
have
the
power
to
civilly
commit
him,
so
society
will
be
protected
in
any
event.
mr.
tom
davis
i
don't
--
mr.
tom
davis
well
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
point
for
me
to
defer
to
the
amicus
counsel
who
will
state
in
some
detail
exactly
what
the
court
is
positioned
on
right
now.
so
with
that
in
mind,
i
will
at
this
time
defer
to
the
--
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir,
for
the
crime
of
public
intoxication.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir,
he
would.
mr.
tom
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
sir
and
i
think
it's
wholly
applicable
to
alcoholism
too.
my
earlier
discussion
simply
got
off
at
my
fault
on
the
practicalities
of
what
we
want
in
the
future.
mr.
tom
davis
yes
it
is.
mr.
tom
davis
no
sir
i
do
not.
