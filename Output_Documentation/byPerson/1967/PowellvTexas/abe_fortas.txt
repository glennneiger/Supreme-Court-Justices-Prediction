justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
imprisonment
at
all
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
here
that
has
happened
to
him?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
equivalence
between
the
dollar
amount
and
the
day
of
imprisonment
in
texas?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that'd
mean
four
days
in
jail
if
he
couldn't
pay
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
davis,
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
of
course
your
argument,
but
i
would
like
to
know
at
some
point
just
what
you
think
should
be
done,
or
what
you
should
would
happen
if
the
police
came
on
the
petitioner
here
on
the
public
street
and
he
was
dead
drunk.
just
what
do
you
think
should
happen
in
that
event?
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
suppose
he's
not,
let's
suppose
he's
walking
around.
he's
navigating
but
he's
obviously
intoxicated,
and
then
you
think
the
police
can
come
up
to
him
and
say
“come
along
with
us.”
and
what
is
that?
is
that
an
arrest
or
is
it
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
stop
or,
it's
not
a
stop
in
prison
but
a
stop
to
sniff
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
suppose
he
says
“i
don't
want
to
go.”
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
you
can't
make
them,
well
suppose
he
does
anyway
even
though
you
think
he
can't?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
kind
of
a
difficult
question
though
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
know
of
no
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
there
any
rule
of
law
that
apart
from
custom
general
opinion
of
mankind
that
permits
a
policeman
to
pick
up
somebody
who
is
sick
and
take
him
up.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
other
instance
in
the
law
that
you
know
of
where
it
makes
that
kind
of
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
prosecute
or
right
to
arrest?it
sounds
i
--
it
seems
to
be
something
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
a
noble
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
anyway
that
it
would
achieve
the
objective
that
you
desire.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
how
do
they
take
--
what
do
you
call
it
when
they
pick
up
the
fellow
and
he
says
“i
don't
want
to
go.”
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
take
him
up
anyway
and
take
him
to
the
precinct.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
agree
with
that
mr.
davis,
but
the
policeman
takes
a
risk
that
he
may
be
prosecuted
in
that
instance.
where
that
police
authority
comes
from
other
than
the
doctrine
of
public
and
private
necessity
has
always
interested
me
and
i'm
not
sure
what
its
origin
is.
but
if
somebody
--
if
some
member
of
the
family
has
a
psychotic
episode
in
the
house,
let's
say.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the,
is
--
sister
or
brother
or
mother
or
father
calls
the
police,
the
police
come
out
then
and
they
see
that
this
person
is
obviously
having
a
psychotic
episode.
then
the
policeman
if
he's
being
a
good
public
servant
will
take
the
person
and
call
an
ambulance
to
take
the
person,
transport
him,
kicking
and
screaming
if
necessary,
to
a
hospital.
now,
let's
say
socially
--
i've
always
thought
that
that
was
socially
necessary
function
of
the
police.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
where
the
authority
comes
from.
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
that
about
what
you're
talking
about
here,
that
is
to
say.
and
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
you
made
the
concession
that
the
police
would
be
perfectly
justified
in
taking
a
person
over
to
the
precinct,
because
if
they've
justified
the
taking
an
alcoholic
to
the
precinct
and
necessarily
follows
a
sergeant
at
the
desk
is
no
more
confident
than
the
policeman
is
to
make
judgment
as
to
his
medical
condition.
so
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
toss
him
into
drunk
tank
then
when
he
comes
up
for
trial,
if
he's
lucky
enough
to
have
a
public
spirited
lawyer
then
the
defense
can
be
made,
medical
testimony
adduced
and
would
be
proved
to
be
a
medical
case.
that's
not
what
you're
after
him.
that's
not
the
problem
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
the
time
to
put
this
on
the
same
basis
as
in
the
person
who
has
a
psychotic
episode
and
he's
taken
off
to
the
hospital.
in
that
kind
of
case,
i
suppose
a
policeman
in
theory
at
any
rate
takes
a
risk
when
he
picks
up
somebody
on
the
street
for
public
drunkenness,
he
takes
a
risk.
may
be
the
person
is
having
a,
or
is
just
recovering
from
an
epileptic
fit
or
as
in
attack
of
amnesia
or
something
else,
a
patient.
and
the
policeman
takes
a
risk.
now
what
you're
suggesting
here
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
prosecute
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense
then
i
would
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
arrest
him.
now
do
you
disagree
with
that?
do
you
think
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
an
extreme
view?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
not
talking
laws
are
you?
you're
talking
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
of
good
conduct
and
this
is
not
a
court
of
conduct.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
convict
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense,
then
it
is
unconstitutional
to
arrest
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense.
now
when
you
come
to
appraising
whether
the
policeman
did
or
did
not
do
something
for
which
he
is
legally
liable
then
you
get
into
a
set
of
very
different
considerations.
if
he
knew
that
the
person
whom
he
arrested
was
a
medically
alcoholic
then
he
has
done
something
that
maybe
capable.
if
he
did
not
know
that
and
had
no
reason
to
know
it
then
he
is
not,
he
has
not
done
something
that
is
medically
capable.
but
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
convict
a
person
who
is
medically
alcoholic,
then
i
suggest
for
your
comment
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
police
to
arrest
such
a
person.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
get
all
of
these
questions
as
to
the
capability
or
non-capability
of
the
opposite.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes
i'm
not
sure.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
there,
but
i
think
too
that
those
are
very
different
considerations.
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
we
were
to
go
behind
that
finding
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
this
man's
track
record,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
conclude
that
either
he
had
a
--
he
wasn't
able
to
control
himself
or
didn't
try
very
hard,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
he
sure
has
a
formidable
track
record,
doesn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
above
average
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
the
local
conditions,
but
i
would
think
it's
above
average.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
basic,
since
your
experts
know
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robinson,
are
you
familiar
with
the
police
practices
in
--
where
is
this,
travis
county?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
i
wondered
whether
its
customary
for
the
policeman
who
arrested
the
drunk
to
appear
in
court
the
next
morning
if
that's
when
the
fellow
is
brought
up
about
to
be
tried
and
sentenced.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
and
you
don't
know
whether
the
police
have
to
take
their
time
to
come
to
the
--
whether
it's
customary
if
the
police
to
take
their
time
to
come
to
the
courtroom
when
the
drunk
tank
is
empty
and
the
drunks
lined
up
as
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
one
be
because
at
anything
that's
argued
here,
would
it?
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
think
you
stated
the
doctrine
correctly.
there's
a
lot
of
difficulty,
there's
a
lot
of
inconsistencies
in
the
cases
in
various
jurisdictions,
but
then
there
are
some
types
of
crimes
in
which
being
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
is
a
defense.
it's
very
restricted
category.
by
an
large,
as
i
understand
it,
in
state
law
and
state
criminal
law
and
administration
it's
not.
but
where
does
this
particular
argument
fit
into
that?
i
don't
gather
your
adversary's
argument
to
be
that
we
are
to
hold
this
unconstitutional
because
it
results
in
a
mental
disease
or
defect
or
anything
it
would
fit
within
category.
what's
your
connection
between
a
holding
to
the
effect
that
convicting
a
person
who,
suffering
from
the
disease
by
alcoholism,
that
such
conviction
under
a
public
intoxication
statute
is
unconstitutional?
and
the
question
of
whether
you
can
apply
state
criminal
law
to
a
person
who's
drunk.
are
you
suggesting
that
one
follows
from
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
wish
you
would
explain
to
me,
because
i
don't
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
aren't
you
back
for
this
business
of
attacking
the
findings?
aren't
you
back
on
that
now?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
galt
case
got
to
do
with
that?
do
you
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
i
suppose
people
read
opinion
very
differently.
i
didn't
--
don't
read
it
quite
that
way.
justice
abe
fortas
but
nobody
suggested
that
they
be
arrested
for
being
sociopaths.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
a
sociopath
who
engages
in
deviant
behavior
on
the
public
street
without
injuring
anybody
or
injuring
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
a
little
cookie.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
we're
not
--
as
i
understand
it,
this
statute
does
not
talk
about
public
intoxication
involving
a
public
nuisance
as
a
difference
between
public
intoxication.
as
i
understand
it
in
being
a
public
nuisance,
you
talk
about
public
intoxication
as
if
there
were
legal
implicit
in
that
phrase,
the
notion
of
a
public
nuisance.
and
i
think
it
--
that's
not
the
necessary
reading
of
the
statute
in
any
event.
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
you're
talking
about
public
nuisances
and
the
statute
talks
about
public
intoxication.i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
you
agreed
that
they're
not
the
same
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
disorderly
conduct.
we're
talking
about
public
intoxication,
period.
that's
what
the
statute
is
that's
what
the
findings
of
the
court
are
in
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
they
very
well
be
that,
and
i
happen
to
believe
that
it
is
very
different
matter
if
you're
dealing
with
disorderly
conduct
or
being
a
public
nuisance
for
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
different
matter,
it's
not
the
issue
before
this
court
at
the
present
time.
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
imprisonment
at
all
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
here
that
has
happened
to
him?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
equivalence
between
the
dollar
amount
and
the
day
of
imprisonment
in
texas?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that'd
mean
four
days
in
jail
if
he
couldn't
pay
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
davis,
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
of
course
your
argument,
but
i
would
like
to
know
at
some
point
just
what
you
think
should
be
done,
or
what
you
should
would
happen
if
the
police
came
on
the
petitioner
here
on
the
public
street
and
he
was
dead
drunk.
just
what
do
you
think
should
happen
in
that
event?
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
suppose
he's
not,
let's
suppose
he's
walking
around.
he's
navigating
but
he's
obviously
intoxicated,
and
then
you
think
the
police
can
come
up
to
him
and
say
“come
along
with
us.”
and
what
is
that?
is
that
an
arrest
or
is
it
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
stop
or,
it's
not
a
stop
in
prison
but
a
stop
to
sniff
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
suppose
he
says
“i
don't
want
to
go.”
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
you
can't
make
them,
well
suppose
he
does
anyway
even
though
you
think
he
can't?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
kind
of
a
difficult
question
though
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
know
of
no
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
there
any
rule
of

that
apart
from

general

of

justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any

in
the
law
that
you
know
of
where
it
makes
that
kind
of
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
prosecute
or
right
to
arrest?it
sounds
i
--
it
seems
to
be
something
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
a
noble
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
anyway
that
it
would
achieve
the
objective
that
you
desire.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
how
do
they
take
--
what
do
you
call
it
when
they
pick
up
the
fellow
and
he
says
“i
don't
want
to
go.”
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
take
him
up
anyway
and
take
him
to
the
precinct.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
agree
with
that
mr.
davis,
but
the
policeman
takes
a
risk
that
he
may
be
prosecuted
in
that
instance.
where
that
police
authority
comes
from
other
than
the
doctrine
of
public
and
private
necessity
has
always
interested
me
and
i'm
not
sure
what
its
origin
is.
but
if
somebody
--
if
some
member
of
the
family
has
a
psychotic
episode
in
the
house,
let's
say.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the,
is
--
sister
or
brother
or
mother
or
father
calls
the
police,
the
police
come
out
then
and
they
see
that
this
person
is
obviously
having
a
psychotic
episode.
then
the
policeman
if
he's
being
a
good
public
servant
will
take
the
person
and
call
an
ambulance
to
take
the
person,
transport
him,
kicking
and
screaming
if
necessary,
to
a
hospital.
now,
let's
say
socially
--
i've
always
thought
that
that
was
socially
necessary
function
of
the
police.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
where
the
authority
comes
from.
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
that
about
what
you're
talking
about
here,
that
is
to
say.
and
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
you
made
the
concession
that
the
police
would
be
perfectly

in

because
if
they've

is
no

that's

you're

that's
not
the
problem
is

justice
abe
fortas
the
time
to
put
this
on
the
same
basis
as
in
the
person
who
has
a
psychotic
episode
and
he's
taken
off
to
the
hospital.
in
that
kind
of
case,
i
suppose
a

in

at
any

takes
a

when
he
picks

and
the

takes

now
what
you're
suggesting
here
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
prosecute
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense
then
i
would
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
arrest
him.
now
do
you
disagree
with
that?
do
you
think
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
an
extreme
view?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
not
talking
laws
are
you?
you're
talking
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
of
good
conduct
and
this
is
not
a
court
of
conduct.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
convict
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense,
then
it
is
unconstitutional
to
arrest
a
person
who
is
an
alcoholic
in
the
medical
sense.
now
when
you
come
to
appraising
whether
the
policeman
did
or
did
not
do
something
for
which
he
is
legally
liable
then
you
get
into
a
set
of
very
different
considerations.
if
he
knew
that
the
person
whom
he
arrested
was
a
medically
alcoholic
then
he
has
done
something
that
maybe
capable.
if
he
did
not
know
that
and
had
no
reason
to
know
it
then
he
is
not,
he
has
not
done
something
that
is
medically
capable.
but
if
it's
unconstitutional
to
convict
a
person
who
is
medically
alcoholic,
then
i
suggest
for
your
comment
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
police
to
arrest
such
a
person.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
get
all
of
these
questions
as
to
the
capability
or
non-capability
of
the
opposite.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes
i'm
not
sure.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
there,
but
i
think
too
that
those
are
very
different
considerations.
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
we
were
to
go
behind
that
finding
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
this
man's
track
record,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
conclude
that
either
he
had
a
--
he
wasn't
able
to
control
himself
or
didn't
try
very
hard,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
he
sure
has
a
formidable
track
record,
doesn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
above
average
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
the
local
conditions,
but
i
would
think
it's
above
average.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
basic,
since
your
experts
know
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robinson,
are
you
familiar
with
the
police
practices
in
--
where
is
this,
travis
county?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
i
wondered
whether
its
customary
for
the
policeman
who
arrested
the
drunk
to
appear
in
court
the
next
morning
if
that's
when
the
fellow
is
brought
up
about
to
be
tried
and
sentenced.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
and
you
don't
know
whether
the
police
have
to
take
their
time
to
come
to
the
--
whether
it's
customary
if
the
police
to
take
their
time
to
come
to
the
courtroom
when
the
drunk
tank
is
empty
and
the
drunks
lined
up
as
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
one
be
because
at
anything
that's
argued
here,
would
it?
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
think
you
stated
the
doctrine
correctly.
there's
a
lot
of
difficulty,
there's
a
lot
of
inconsistencies
in
the
cases
in
various
jurisdictions,
but
then
there
are
some
types
of
crimes
in
which
being
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
is
a
defense.
it's
very
restricted
category.
by
an
large,
as
i
understand
it,
in
state
law
and
state
criminal
law
and
administration
it's
not.
but
where
does
this
particular
argument
fit
into
that?
i
don't
gather
your
adversary's
argument
to
be
that
we
are
to
hold
this
unconstitutional
because
it
results
in
a
mental
disease
or
defect
or
anything
it
would
fit
within
category.
what's
your
connection
between
a
holding
to
the
effect
that
convicting
a
person
who,
suffering
from
the
disease
by
alcoholism,
that
such
conviction
under
a
public
intoxication
statute
is
unconstitutional?
and
the
question
of
whether
you
can
apply
state
criminal
law
to
a
person
who's
drunk.
are
you
suggesting
that
one
follows
from
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
wish
you
would
explain
to
me,
because
i
don't
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
aren't
you
back
for
this
business
of
attacking
the
findings?
aren't
you
back
on
that
now?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
galt
case
got
to
do
with
that?
do
you
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
i
suppose
people
read
opinion
very
differently.
i
didn't
--
don't
read
it
quite
that
way.
justice
abe
fortas
but
nobody
suggested
that
they
be
arrested
for
being
sociopaths.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
a
sociopath
who
engages
in
deviant
behavior
on
the
public
street
without
injuring
anybody
or
injuring
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
a
little
cookie.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
we're
not
--
as
i
understand
it,
this
statute
does
not
talk
about
public
intoxication
involving
a
public
nuisance
as
a
difference
between
public
intoxication.
as
i
understand
it
in
being
a
public
nuisance,
you
talk
about
public
intoxication
as
if
there
were
legal
implicit
in
that
phrase,
the
notion
of
a
public
nuisance.
and
i
think
it
--
that's
not
the
necessary
reading
of
the
statute
in
any
event.
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
you're
talking
about
public
nuisances
and
the
statute
talks
about
public
intoxication.i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
you
agreed
that
they're
not
the
same
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
disorderly
conduct.
we're
talking
about
public
intoxication,
period.
that's
what
the
statute
is
that's
what
the
findings
of
the
court
are
in
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
they
very
well
be
that,
and
i
happen
to
believe
that
it
is
very
different
matter
if
you're
dealing
with
disorderly
conduct
or
being
a
public
nuisance
for
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
different
matter,
it's
not
the
issue
before
this
court
at
the
present
time.
