mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
appeal
is
a
more
narrow
one
and
in
view
of
the
last
statements
of
counsel
for
amici,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
case
raises
the
constitutional
question
they
wish
to
raise
at
all.
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
whether
an
excessive
drinker
who
has
the
ability
to
abstain
may
be
convicted
of
public
intoxication
consistently
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now
if
indeed
it
is
conceded
that
a
person
who
has
the
power
to
abstain
would
not
be
subject
to
this
constitutional
immunity,
we
feel
that
this
case
does
not
raise
the
question
sought
at
all.
the
record
is
very
short.
the
critical
witness
on
the
question
of
the
appellant's
ability
to
abstain
was
the
only
psychiatrist
called,
he
was
called
by
the
defendant.
the
psychiatrist,
the
dr.david
wade
who
was
amply
qualified
as
an
expert
in
the
field
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
alcoholics
for
a
period
of
over
25
years,
did
testify
on
direct
examination
that
the
appellant
has
an
uncontrollable
compulsion
to
drink
and
that
his
going
in
public
is
involuntary.
however,
on
cross-examination
this
general
assertion
was
substantially
qualified
and
clarified,
and
i'm
reading
form
the
record
on
page
26,
referring
to
the
appellant.
question
“but
at
the
time
that
he
takes
the
first
drink
from
a
sober
condition,
would
you
say
that
it
is
a
voluntary
exercise
of
his
will?”
answer
“yes.
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
yes,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
must
take
into
account”
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
reading
on
page
26
of
the
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
and
we
must
take
into
account
that
these
individuals
have
a
compulsion
and
this
compulsion
while
not
completely
overpowering
is
a
very
strong
influence
and
exceedingly
strong
influence.
and
this
compulsion
coupled
with
the
firm
belief
in
their
mind
that
they're
going
to
be
able
to
handle
it
from
now
on
causes
their
judgment
to
be
somewhat
clouded.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am,
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
is,
obviously,
we
are
not
completely
pleased
with
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
gather
that
texas
has
a
practice
which
in
my
own
experience
is
i
would
say
unusual
of
allowing
counsel
who
does
not
prevail
to
submit
proposed
findings
of
fact.
in
this
case,
defense
counsel
submitted
proposed
findings
of
fact
on
the
afternoon
this
case
was
tried
and
the
judge
signed
them.
but
our
position
is
that
there's
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
lack
power
to
abstain
from
drinking
entirely.
although
we
do
concede
that
there's
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
a
conclusion
that
he
could
not
drink
moderately,
the
ones
he
started
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he
has
a
record
of
73
arrests
over
a
period
of
16
years
which
is
to
say
of
being
arrested
between
four
and
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
that
this
person
frequently
drank
to
excess.
there's
no
doubt
about
that
at
all,
but
the
astonishing
thing
is
that
some
people
do
want
to
drink
to
excess
occasionally
and
sometimes
even
frequently,
that
some
people
do
want
to
adopt
a
way
of
life
involving
excessive
use
of
alcohol.
now
it
is
quite
common
to
characterize
that
as
loss
of
control
because
the
person
doing
the
characterizing
is
ordinarily
evaluating
them
from
quite
a
different
set
of
values.
the
expert
says
“well
if
i
were
that
guy,
i
would
not
continue
to
drink
in
view
of
the
consequences
on
his
total
life,
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
the
man's
behavior
is
involuntary.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
studies
by
interview
of
these
people,
indicate
that
many
of
them
say
“i
like
to
drink”
and
many
of
them
say
“i've
never
tried
to
stop”
but
ought
that
to
immunize
them.
now
the
record
in
this
case
also
includes
a
statement
of
dr.wade
in
terms
of
his
taking
the
history
of
the
appellant
that
the
appellant
had
never
been
referred
to
alcoholics
anonymous.
he
didn't
go
beyond
that,
but
i
assume
by
that,
that
he
was
being
polite
in
saying
that
the
defendant
had
not
sought
the
help
of
alcoholics
anonymous.
well
why
not?
i
assume
that
the
defendant
for
whatever
reason
had
a
desire
to
continue
his
present
way
of
life.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
we're
prepared
to
make
a
constitutional
argument
even
accepting
the
findings
of
fact.
may
i
allude
to
that
in
just
a
moment?
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
appellant
did
make
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
court
can
go
behind
those
findings
of
fact
your
honor
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
in
the
first
place,
they're
not
findings
of
specific
historical
fact.
they
are
conclusions
which
are
interfused
with
standards
which
are
proposed
for
constitutional
adjudication.
the
first
two
findings
of
fact,
the
critical
ones,
are
very
generalized
statements
about
the
nature
of
chronic
alcoholism.
so
it
seems
to
me
they're
--
they
contain
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
about
as
much
law
as
fact,
and
furthermore,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
is
capable
of
taking
judicial
notice
of
facts
of
this
sort.
i
would
think
it
astonishing
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
believe
that
the
court
is
the
position
to
become
as
much
experts
in
alcoholism
as
the
trial
court
was
in
texas.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i'd
like
to
answer
your
honor,
but
i
have
no
information
on
which
to
make
any
statement.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
this
is
a
case
or
i
believe
this
is
a
case
on
appeal
your
honor,
and
how
many
drunks
it
gets,
i
do
not
know.
it
was
appealed
from
the
lower
court
to
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
to
what
i
assume
is
a
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
he
saw
the
petitioner,
right.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he
did
see
him.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
not
seen
him.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
believe
conclusions
with
respect
to
volitional
capacity
are
not
or
cannot
be
made
on
the
basis
of
seeing
someone.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
we
assert
these
findings
are
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
medical
witness
was
being
extremely
careful
on
cross-examination
and
he
explained
himself
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
direct
examination
was
primarily
conducted
by
leading
questions.
i
think
he
was
trying
--
i
assume
he
was
trying
to
give
honest
answers
to
both
counsel
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
i
do
think
that
the
cross-examination
is
significant.
i
think
it's
also
significant
that
during
the
redirect
examination,
there
was
no
attempt
the
physician's
statement
on
cross-examination.
now
the
defendant,
at
one
time,
was
asked
“can
you
stop
drinking”
and
he
said
“no.”
that's
the
only
other
evidence
in
the
record,
but
i
would
say
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
question
because
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
that
means
stop
after
you
start
or
stop
in
the
sense
of
completely
abstaining.
now
it's
my
understanding
that
typical
members
of
alcoholics
anonymous
for
example
characterize
loss
of
control
as
loss
of
control
after
they
take
their
first
drink.
and
dr.wade
was
making
this
statement
not
only
with
respect
to
the
appellant
but
with
respect
--
he
said
the
appellant
was
fairly
typical
of
alcoholics.
and
we
have
other
authorities
who
also
indicate
that
the
dominant
form
of
american
alcoholism
contains
this
phenomenon,
namely
an
inability
to
drink
moderately
but
an
ability
to
completely
abstain.
as
to
the
finding
--
well
i
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
contend
that
even
if
the
findings
are
sustained
that
the
conviction
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no.
well
perhaps
yes
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
have
to
change
my
answer
and
say
yes
on
the
basis
that
the
trail
court
stated.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
defendant's
--
the
appellant's
argument
seems
to
us
to
be
this,
that
there
exists
a
disease
and
i
get
the
impression
that
is
looked
upon
almost
a
unitary
disease
called
chronic
alcoholism.
and
that
this
destroyed
his
will
to
abstain,
his
will
to
drink
moderately,
his
will
to
avoid
appearing
in
public
in
a
condition
of
intoxication
and
therefore
he
ought
to
be
treated
not
as
a
responsible
human
being
but
rather
as
an
ill
person
who
is
acting
without
volition.
at
the
outset,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
this
argument,
if
accepted
by
the
court,
would
have
revolutionary
implications
for
the
criminal
law.
for
example,
the
alcoholic
driver
who
drives
to
another
bar
or
to
a
liquor
store
to
get
a
bottle
of
liquor
would
presumably
have
a
defense
of
chronic
alcoholism
to
a
charge
of
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
or
even
perhaps
to
negligent
homicide.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
if
we
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
not
in
every
situation,
but
where
there's
a
close
cause
or
relation
between
his
chronic
alcoholism
and
the
crime
for
which
he's
charged,
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
would
also
has
to
be
shown
presumably
an
adequate
cause
or
relationship
between
his
alcoholism
and
his
robbery
or
rape.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
but
i'm
assuming
that.
assuming
that,
but
i
agree.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
assuming
an
adequate
relationship
between
the
homicide
and
his
drive
to
get
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
a
ruling
on
the
basis
of
the
sort
of
volitional
criteria
that
they
suggest
as
a
basis
for
constitutional
adjudication
would
have
that
consequence.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
volitional
criteria,
by
that
i
meant
requiring
volition
in
some
sense
independent
of
his
drive
to
obtain
liquor.
i'm
not
disputing
it
here
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
the
principle
which
they
urge
would
also
a
fortiori
be
applicable
to
crimes
by
a
narcotic
cabinet.
immediately
go
on
presumably
would
be
the
possession
of
narcotic
statute
to
which
under
the
uniform
narcotics
act
is
fairly
general
throughout
the
nation.
if
the
person
accused
were
a
narcotics
addict
and
presumably
sale
of
narcotics
by
an
addict
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
also
be
exculpated.
and
theft
and
prostitution
and
robbery
by
an
addict
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
presumably
also,
under
the
principle
urged
here,
be
exculpated.
now
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
alcoholism
and
other
crimes,
we
have
not
--
we
have
presented
some
information
in
our
brief
on
page
17
and
18
a
long
study
in
columbus,
ohio
indicated
64
persons
who
were
arrested
for
felonies
were
intoxicated.
now
that
was
not
necessarily
chronic
alcoholics.
it
would
include
presumably
some
chronic
alcoholics
and
undetermined
member.
in
the
study
in
sing
sing
prison
indicated
that
22%
of
their
prisoners
were
habitually
tampered.
well
there
is
a
strong
relationship
between
alcohol
and
other
crimes
because
as
is
well
known
it
does
relax
one's
inhibitions.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
we're
only
talking
about
harmless
passive
skid
row
derelicts
because
the
range
of
chronic
alcoholics
or
people
diagnosed
chronic
alcoholics
extends
through
all
types
of
personalities;
sociopaths,
passive
aggressive
personality,
schizophrenics,
etcetera.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
homogenous
group.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that
yes
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that
must
be
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that's
their
position,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am
not
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
information
your
honor
with
respect
to
that.
i
am
not
a
resident
of
texas
myself.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
information
on
that
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
deal
specifically
with
the
allegation
that
alcoholism
is
a
disease
because
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
follow
your
honor,
as
i
understand
existing
law
being
intoxicated
is
if
indeed
the
evidence
suggest
a
intoxication
produced
a
lack
of
specific
intent.
as
i
understand
existing
law,
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime
requiring
specific
intent.
in
other
words
his
intoxication
at
present
has
evidentiary
significance.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
position,
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
whether
the
robbery
was
in
some
sense
a
product
of
his
chronic
alcoholism.
now
what
that
might
mean,
i
suppose
would
depend
upon
further
decisions
of
the
court.
but
under
the
carter
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
similar
matter
was
litigated,
they
said
that
the
crime
would
be
a
product
of
a
mental
disease
if
it
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
mental
disease,
which
is
to
say
a
very
little
cause
or
relationship
was
required.
and
indeed
the
cause
or
relationship
had
to
be
negative
by
the
prosecution
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
order
for
the
man
to
be
convicted.
so
i
would
think
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
exculpate
a
robbery
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
principle
on
which
the
appellant
seeks
an
adjudication
in
his
favor
is
a
principle
that
goes
far
beyond
the
crime
of
public
intoxication.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
seems
for
example
in
the
case
of
--
the
easiest
case
i
suppose
is
of
a
narcotics
addict
who
was
charged
for
illegal
possession
of
narcotics.
now
i
assume
that
a
principle
which
says
that
in
addiction
to
alcohol
is
a
disease
which
destroys
a
man's
ability
to
control
his
behavior
and
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
it
does
follow
from
robinson
against
california,
but
the
critical
importance
of
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
it
seeks
to
extend
robinson
versus
california
to
exculpate
with
respect
to
crimes
of
behavior.
robinson
versus
california
was
not
a
crime
of
delinquent
behavior.
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
extend
robinson
to
a
crime
of
delinquent
behavior
and
we
say
that
principle
has
few
stopping
places.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that
would
be
behavior
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
when
one
lies
across
the
sidewalk
that
would
likely
be
–
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
according
to
the
record
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
assume
that's
correct.
i
assume
that's
correct
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
behavior
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
which
is
inseparable
under
the
theory
proposed
would
include
such
things
as
littering
the
streets,
becoming
incontinent,
becoming
ill
sick
to
one's
stomach,
abusing
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me?
oh!
i
think
that
in
other
words
i
think
that
this
statute
has
a
prophylactic
function
in
the
sense
that
even
though
this
man
at
present
may
not
be
staggering
out
in
front
of
a
car.
or
even
though
at
present
may
not
be
cursing
pedestrians
or
walking
by,
he
can
be
removed
from
the
street
before
these
things
occur.
and
i
think
too
there
are
aesthetic
aspects
to
this
type
of
prohibition
which
are
of
importance
to
many
americans.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
being
in
a
sort
of
bowery
type
of
atmosphere
is
extremely
disturbing
to
many
people.
i
think
many
people
would
prefer
to
have
their
communities
not
be
this
way.
but
i
think
there's
a
substantial
aesthetic
element
in
this
specific
crime
which
we're
involved
with
here.
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
we've
made
some
sort
of
attempt
in
our
brief
to
state
our
position
and
i
won't
say
much
more
except
this,
that
when
we
use
disease
in
this
context,
we're
not
using
it
in
the
context
of
something
which
is
capable
of
scientific
verification
that
it
is
or
is
not
a
disease.
the
american
psychiatric
association
has
--
my
note
on
that
escapes
me
for
the
moment,
but
the
american
psychiatric
association
calls
alcoholism
a
personality
disorder.
a
class
which
includes
disorders
of
psychogenic
origin
or
without
clearly
defined
tangible
cause
or
structural
chain.
academic
psychiatrists
who
are
the
only
people
i
gather
frequently
ask
themselves
seriously
what
do
psychiatrists
mean
by
disease,
although
occasionally
it's
required
now
in
medical
–
in
legal
contexts
as
well,
indicate
that
what
we
mean
by
disease
is
disorderly
behavior
or
deviant
behavior
i
should
say.
that
the
classification
of
disease
within
which
it
maybe
asserted
that
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
in
other
words,
is
not
a
category
which
precludes
criminality.
it's
a
category
which
overlaps
criminality
because
the
psychiatrists
are
also
concerned
with
deviant
behavior.
well
why
then
is
there
so
much
concern
whether
it's
a
disease
or
it
isn't
a
disease?
well
we
suggest
there's
concern
because
disease
has
so
much
emotional
force.
you
find
various
groups
interested
in
achieving
with
respect
to
alcoholic
saying
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
alcoholism
a
disease.
the
reason
they're
doing
this
is
not
because
this
is
a
descriptively
meaningful
statement,
but
because
they
realize
it
has
this
emotional
force.
now
as
to
chronic
alcoholism
as
itself,
as
the
court
--
as
some
members
of
the
court
have
noted,
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
different
types
of
definitions
frequently
framed
in
terms
of
social
deviancy.
for
example
endangering
public
moral,
safety
and
welfare,
or
altering
his
--
interfering
with
his
mental
health
etcetera.
now
it
is
quite
true
that
there
is
commonly
in
a
definition,
although
not
always,
an
indication
that
the
criterion
is
whether
a
man
can
control,
whether
he
can
control
his
behavior
with
respect
to
drinking.
however,
how
can
we
determine
whether
a
person
can
control
his
behavior?
it
is
said
“well
you
can't
ask
him
because
alcoholics
are
can
not
frequently
to
be
depended
upon
to
give
away
--“
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
the
findings
mean
your
honor.
in
other
words,
assuming
a
person
is
said
to
lack
ability
to
control
what
is
meant
by
this.
it's
not
something
which
can
be
observed
and
scientifically
demonstrated.
as
far
as
i
can
see
what
it
really
means
is
that
the
expert
from
the
standpoint
of
his
values
or
for
what
--
or
from
the
standpoint
of
what
he
assumes
to
be
community
values
is
believing
that
the
individual
is
acting
unwisely.
now
i
that
judge
bazelon
was
coming
to
that
point
in
the
washington
case
which
we
just
decided
at
the
end
of
last
year.
that
when
the
psychiatrist
was
talking
in
terms
of
behavior
controls,
he
said
this
was
largely
merely
a
façade
with
respect
to
the
moral
judgments
of
the
psychiatrist.
if
you
say
in
the
ultimate
sense
on
the
basis
of
this
person's
whole
life
history
that
you
can
--
that
it
seems
likely
that
he
will
continue
to
drink.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
said
with
respect
to
criminality
in
general
if
you
assume,
as
psychiatrists
tend
to
assume,
that
people
are
controlled
by
their
prior
histories
and
their
genetic
equivalent.
we
attempted
to
make
our
position
clear
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
assertion
that
the
criminal
law
only
ought
to
apply
to
people
who
act
because
of
freewill.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
controversy
that
is
not
essential
to
constitutional
adjudication
of
who
is
to
be
criminally
responsible
and
who
is
not
to
be
criminally
responsible.
it
is
clear
to
us
that
the
criminal
law
traditionally
has
not
required
free
will.
for
example,
typical
insanity
test
have
not
required
freewill
and
even
the
durham
rule
does
not
necessarily
require
freewill
if
mental
disease
is
thought
to
have
some
significance
beyond
volitional
criteria.
furthermore,
the
criminal
law
hasn't
said
to
a
person
who
is
uncontrollably
angry
and
who's
charged
with
homicide
that
you
were
to
be
exculpated
because
you
didn't
have
freewill.
we
believe
that
the
criminal
law
is
rational
as
applied
to
even
a
chronic
alcoholic
for
it
includes
givig
him
an
opportunity
for
food,
clothing,
shelter
or
period
of
compulsory
continence.
the
d.c.crime
report
indicated
that
the
health
of
chronic
alcoholics
in
the
district
had
markedly
deteriorated
following
the
easter
decision.
now,
it
may
be
as
additional
facilities
are
brought
to
bear
that
things
will
get
better,
but
it
seems
that
that
is
a
completely
or
is
a
largely
unpredictable
matter
because
we
don't
have
very
much
experience
with
alternative
facilities
in
this
country.
now
we
don't
have
very
much
experience
as
to
how
much
for
example
cooperation
alcoholics
would
give
if
voluntary
facilities
are
made
available
to
them.
counsel
for
the
appellants
cited
the
experience
recently
in
saint
louis
in
which
he
indicated
that
95%
of
the
alcoholics
referred
to
their
detoxification
center,
had
stayed
there
as
long
as
the
doctors
wanted
them
to.
actually
the
figure
was
97%,
however
the
maximum
stay
there
was
only
seven
days.
and
we
don't
--
and
these
were
alcoholics
who
were
threatened
with
criminal
prosecution
if
they
left.
presumably,
that
would
not
be
allowed
if
the
court
decides
as
appellant
requests
here.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
is
quite
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
was
talking
about
their
reference
to
saint
louis
statistics
with
respect
to
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
cooperation
of
alcoholics.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
as
i
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
read
the
article
to
which
they
referred
and
it
was
an
article
by
a
person
that
has
some
responsibility
for
the
program
and
i
assume
that
he
would
not
do
it
injustice
and
he
indicated
that
if
they
didn't
cooperate
with
the
seven-day
detoxification
that
they
were
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
in
the
saint
louis.
well
under
those
circumstances
he
indicated
97%
did
stay
there
as
long
as
the
doctors
wanted.
now
it
may
be
also
that
the
doctors
said
“well
if
you
want
to
leave
i'll
let
you
leave”
so
some
left
earlier
anyway.
our
experience
with
respect
to
voluntary
clinics
does
not
provide
a
particular
basis
for
optimism.
with
respect
to
people
who
voluntarily
seek
help,
according
to
one
recent
study,
50%
of
alcoholic
patients
after
one
contact
with
voluntary
clinic
did
not
reappear.
i
don't
believe
that
i
have
the
study
which
i
want
to
refer
to.
i
think
was
stated
slightly
too
strongly.
the
study
i
had
indicated
i
think
about
33%
left
after
their
initial
visit
and
about
75%
after
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
there're
some
other
statitics
indicated
in
the
appellant's
brief
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
in
both
the
opening
appellant's
brief
and
the
reply
appellant's
brief
figures
in
the
neighborhood
of
50%
of
cured,
or
aided,
or
arrested
alcoholics
are
cited.
however,
if
you
will
examine
the
context
of
these
figures,
you
will
find
that
these
do
not
refer
to
populations
of
skid
row
alcoholics
the
sort
of
person
who
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
in
this
case.
the
one
congressional
record
citation
which
is
given
was
changed
in
the
edited
version
of
the
congressional
version,
i
assume,
because
it
made
it
clear
that
it
was
referring
to
a
hospital
population
and
not
to
a
population
to
persons
who
are
being
arrested
for
public
intoxication.
united
states
public
health
service
came
up
with
quite
different
figures
in
a
recent
study,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
namely
that
it
was
thought
unlikely
that
more
than
10-12%
could
be
even
aided,
even
aided
and
aided
may
only
mean
that
a
person
decided
to
stay
sober
a
little
bit
more
often.
well
it
may
be
that
things
would
be
much
better
than
that,
it
may
be,
but
we
do
not
yet
have
the
data
to
know.
we
have
just
the
beginnings
of
various
programs
which
do
not
provide
the
basis.
it
seems
to
us,
for
constitutional
adjudication
which
would
have
the
effect
of
terminating
existing
program.
with
respect
to
the
robinson's
case
itself,
we've
attempted
to
deal
with
it
in
our
brief.
we
feel
it
does
not
reach
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
it
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
doesn't
indicate
the
way
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
we
think
there
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
we
think
there
are
values
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
we
feel
there
are
values
in
the
present
system.
we're
believers
in
the
criminal
law.
in
other
words,
the
notion
of
taking
a
person
off
the
street
for
four
or
five
days,
as
this
--
as
the
appellant
was
taken
off
the
street
for
four
or
five
days.
and
given
the
opportunity
for
at
least
physical
rehabilitation
and
then
released
and
allowed
to
go
as
he
pleases
has
some
valuable
to
appellant
and
to
the
city
of
austin,
texas.
it
avoids
many
of
the
problems
of
creating
a
bowery
in
the
city
of
austin,
texas
and
it
offers
some
advantages
to
the
appellant.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
$50
fine
i
suppose
is
less
arguably
of
benefit
to
the
appellant.
however,
i
gather
that
the
$50
was
not
commonly
paid
by
the
appellant
from
what
was
said,
although
i
don't
know
that
the
record
supports
that.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
what
the
evidence
suggests,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
he
would,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
if
he
were
to
have
to
pay
the
$50
fine
that
would
be
punishment
that
punishment
again
presumably
includes
some
other
objectives.
for
example
it
might,
if
he
were
able
to
pay
it
or
if
a
person
were
able
to
pay
it,
it
might
make
them
more
inclined
to
drink
at
home.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
is
that
is
what
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
only
penalty
permitted
by
the
texas
statute
is
a
fine.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he's
been
arrested
73
times.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
don't
follow
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes,
he
had
been
locked
up
in
jail
before.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
if
he
didn't
have
the
$50,
presumably
he
would
not
pay
the
$50.00
and
that
would
not
deter
him
from
drinking.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
and
he
would
go
to
jail.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
chances
are
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
still
--
if
by
in
a
sense
it
is
punishment,
but
i
don't
think
it's
purely
retributive
punishment.
in
other
words,
to
a
person
that
has
$50
presumably
that's
some
incentive
to
the
individual
not
to
appear
in
public
in
a
state
of
intoxication.
to
the
person
that
does
not
have
the
$50
there
are
advantages
in
a
period
of
confinement.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
his
case.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
that
there's
an
equal
protection
issue.
it
is
not
been
raised
and
i've
not
attempted
to
research
it.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
see
an
issue
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
robinson
case
and
the
driver
case
and
the
easter
case,
we
will
rely
on
what
we've
said
in
our
brief.
there
are
some
cases
on
the
other
side
which
are
also
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
the
hoyt
case
in
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
michigan
held
that
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
require
a
result
of
the
sort
argued
for
here.
in
the
narcotics
area,
the
cases
seem
to
be
unanimous
and
not
extending
robinson
beyond
its
limitations
to
include
behavior
with
respect
to
narcotics.
it
seems
to
me
they're
all
against
the
principle
which
is
urged
here.
with
respect
to
the
--
with
--
the
presidential
crime
commission
did
as
appellant
states
recommend
that
public
drunkenness
not
itself
be
a
crime
that
the
principle
that
they
espouse
is
far
more
limited
than
the
one
here
because
for
example
they
recommended
the
disorderly
conduct
continue
to
be
a
crime.
but
on
a
purely
involitional
principle
which
we're
talking
about
here,
it
would
seem
that
the
disorderly
conduct
would
also
fall
and
indeed
mr.
hutt
has
made
that
argument
on
other
occasions.
with
respect
to
the
possibilities
of
achieving
youthful
social
reform
by
forbidding
a
continuation
of
the
present
system,
it
seems
to
us
a
number
of
questions
ought
to
be
asked.
one
question
we've
already
addressed
ourselves
to
and
that's
the
question
of
what
are
the
chances
of
improvement.
if
indeed
we
are
not
likely
to
get
substantial
improvement
with
respect
of
a
lot
of
alcoholics
by
referring
them
either
to
the
streets
or
to
alternative
facilities,
it
seems
that
that
would
be
a
reason
not
to
force
this
sort
of
a
program
across
the
nation.
one
thing
that
would
be
helpful
to
know
for
example
is
how
many
chronic
alcoholics
change
their
way
of
life
under
present
practice.
we
don't
really
know
this.
we
know
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
that
don't
that
we
don't
have
studies
that
indicate
what
the
incidence
is
of
those
who
do.
and
we
don't
have
studies
indicating
what
the
comparative
results
are
between
a
detoxification
approach
of
a
few
days
detoxification
as
in
a
medical
facility
compared
to
a
few
days
detoxification
in
a
jail.
somehow,
detoxification
has
a
much
more
pleasant
sound,
but
essentially
detoxification
is
an
opportunity
for
a
person
to
sober
up
i
assume.
i
would
be
very
interested
in
studies
which
are
now
for
example
being
undertaken
with
respect
to
the
saint
louis
experiment.
i
understand
that
since
studies
are
being
done
by
washington
university
at
saint
louis,
however
we
don't
have
the
results
of
those
studies
yet.
mr.
hutt
says
there's
a
bowery
project
that's
been
inaugurated,
be
interesting
to
find
out
what
the
success
of
that
program
is,
but
we
don't
have
any
information
yet,
and
there's
some
studies
in
other
cities
as
well.
well,
ultimately
we
submit,
society
is
faced
with
a
series
of
possible
choices
in
terms
of
what
ought
to
be
done
with
respect
to
skid
row
alcoholic.
we
feel
that
there
are
three
essential
alternatives
which
are
before
society.
now
one
is
that
the
present
procedures
continued
to
be
allowed
that
criminal
or
civil
processes
be
allowed
with
respect
to
alcoholics
and
in
some
communities
essentially
leaving
them
alone
would
continue
to
be
allowed.
and
this
would
include
probation
programs
and
various
other
types
of
programs
which
are
tied
to
the
criminal
process.
however,
the
appellant
urges
that
well
the
criminal
process
itself
ought
to
be
forbidden
in
part
because
jails
are
frequently
badly
ran
institutions.
well
we
feel
that
here
is
a
real
opportunity
for
the
notion
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
its
traditional
sense.
if
indeed
jails
in
some
communities
are
badly
run
institutions
then
it
would
seem
to
us
appropriate
that
those
jails
be
thought
to
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
in
a
historically
sanctioned
sense.
and
that
those
facilities
would
not
be
continued
to
be
used
not
only
by
habitual
alcoholics
but
by
any
other
people
who
are
subject
to
penal
confinement.
a
second
alternative
is
to
permit
civil
commitment
only
and
i
gather
this
is
commonly
in
approach
which
is
appealing
to
the
medical
profession.
it
is
frequently
thought
that
people
who
are
heavily
committed
to
drugs
or
to
alcohol
can
not
be
cured
under
that
patient
basis.
they
have
to
be
taken
to
an
environment
where
there's
more
control
that
the
environment
ought
to
be
continued
until
the
processes
of
attempted
pretreatment
can
be
continued.
the
model
for
this
approach
to
the
treatment
of
alcoholics
would
be
the
state
mental
hospital
or
the
juvenile
detention
facility.
objectives
of
treatment
and
isolation
would
indeed
be
served.
however,
in
spite
of
the
eagerness
of
some
people
to
funnel
people
to
civil
facilities
and
indeed
of
course
this
has
been
the
approaches
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
california
following
the
decision
of
the
robinson
case
with
respect
to
narcotics
addict.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
some
real
problems
with
respect
to
that.
we
feel
that
the
criminal
process
has
great
advantages
in
terms
of
the
specificity
of
the
charge
which
must
be
levied,
the
specificity
of
the
statutory
proscription
that
a
person
can
not
merely
be
confined
on
the
basis
of
some
person
feeling
that
he
is
ill
under
the
vega's
criteria
and
that
he
requires
treatment.
and
we
feel
that
the
specificity
of
sentence
also
has
an
advantage.
there's
an
advantage
in
the
fact
the
defendant
after
four
days
in
jail
would
get
out
of
jail.
his
disturbance
of
austin
society
was
not
so
great
as
to
justify
indefinite
incarceration
and
the
criminal
process
had
the
advantages
compared
to
the
civil
process,
it
seems
to
us,
in
not
permitting
for
his
own
good
and
under
a
theory
of
benevolence,
indefinite
in
incarceration
is
as
frequently
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
commitment
approaches
to
treatment.
it
seems
to
us,
in
other
words
that
the
experience
in
the
galt
case
where
we
had
probably,
i
suppose
by
and
large
a
much
more
tractable
population
that
we
were
dealing
with
in
terms
of
juvenile
delinquents
than
we
do
with
respect
to
people
whose
long
time
drinking
habits
have
caused
them
to
be
characterized
as
chronic
alcoholics
by
and
large,
should
make
us
very
wary
of
saying
to
the
medical
profession
“well
you
take
these
people
over
and
treat
them
if
you
will.”
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
galt
case,
it
seems
to
us,
to
involve
an
inquiry
into
what
has
happened
in
another
area
of
deviant
behavior
where
there's
been
an
effort
to
terminate
the
criminal
process
and
replace
it
by
a
therapeutic
approach
with
long
term
treatment
available
without
specific
criteria
as
to
the
amount
of
social
damage
which
is
been
caused.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
third
approach
is
the
approach
which
i
gather
is
essentially
urged
here
by
the
appellant
and
by
the
aclu,
although
not
by
the
philadelphia
amicus
and
that
is
terminate
the
possibilities
of
compulsory
criminal
control,
terminate
the
possibilities
of
compulsory
civil
control
and
allow
chronic
alcoholics
if
they
wish
to
remain
on
the
street.
now
this
is
largely
the
approach
which
has
been
followed
in
the
city
of
new
york
for
many,
many
years
and
there
it
led
to
the
bowery.
we
believe
that
this
would
have
unfortunate
consequences
both
as
a
quality
of
american
urban
life
and
also
unfortunate
consequences
in
terms
of
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
chronic
alcoholics
themselves.
in
summary,
our
position
is
that
we
ought
not
now
in
terms
of
the
information
available,
and
in
terms
of
to
be
prepared
descript.
the
devices
for
social
control
and
the
criminal
processes
with
respect
to
chronic
alcoholics,
and
we
ought
not
now
to
devote
to
adopt
the
principle
which
would
clearly
apply
not
only
to
alcoholic
offenders
but
also
to
narcotic
offenders,
and
indeed
to
many
other
types
of
offenders.
sociopaths,
for
example,
are
frequently
defined
in
terms
of
lack
of
behavior
control
and
their
crimes
ran
the
whole
gamut
as
the
court
knows
of
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
he
appellant
be
arrested
for
being
a
chronic
alcoholic.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
we
suggest
that
when
he
appears
drunk
in
a
public
place
that
he
be
subject
to
arrest.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
just
a
little
cookie?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
would
suppose
it
would
depend
upon
what
is
deviant
behavior
it
was.
if
it
was
covered
by
a
criminal
proscription,
i
assume
that
he
would
be
--
i
would
hope
that
he
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
process,
if
it
weren't
--
if
that
weren't
the
case
and
i
would
just
hope
that
he
would
not
be
subject
to
criminal
process.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
would
agree
your
honor.
i
would
--
my
point
is
that
the
principle
urged
here
and
i
--
that
in
terms
of
a
principle
decision,
the
principle
here
would
immediately
reach
the
sort
of
substantial
public
nuisances
that
i've
been
talking
about.
now
it's
possible
to
adopt
a
different
principle
namely
that
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
i
could
--
i
agreed
to
the
statute
would
apply
to
people
whose
behavior
was
not
markedly
disorderly.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
principle
which
is
urged
as
a
basis
for
the
constitutional
adjudication
by
this
court
does
indeed
reach
disorderly
conduct.
now,
i
can
agree
that
there
are
possibilities
through
other
principles
of
limiting
the
reach
of
the
sort
of
decision
which
the
appellant
seek.
for
example,
i
could
imagine
that
it
could
be
thought
that
the
social
objective
with
respect
to
removing
chronic
alcoholics
themselves
did
not
justify
their
incarceration,
but
the
social
objectives
with
respect
to
chronics
alcoholics
who
for
example
were
uttering
obscenities
might
indeed
justify
subjecting
them
to
the
criminal
process.
but
the
difference
between
those
two
cases
seems
to
us
not
to
be
in
terms
of
their
analysis
of
the
principle
they
suggest
whether
one
is
more
volitional
than
the
other.
it
seems
so
us
in
--
that
the
case
goes
not
only
to
the
alcoholic,
to
the
addict,
to
the
sociopath
etcetera
but
that
the
case
essentially
asks
this
court
to
adopt
standards
for
criminal
insanity
which
would
be
of
a
constitutional
dimension
would
be
applicable
throughout
the
nation.
because
again
the
principle
they
urge
is
one
which
requires
a
volitional
insanity
test,
it
seems
to
us,
namely
they
urge
that
a
person
whose
behavior
is
the
product
of
something
denominated
in
mental
illness
that
this
person
be
exculpated.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
they're
also
asking
for
the
abolition
of
the
insanity
test
currently
prevalent
in
most
of
the
states.
now,
without
arguing
the
pros
or
cons
of
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
evanescence
sort
of
standards
referring
to
behavior
controls
which
are
proposed
here,
at
least
we
don't
know
enough
about
them
and
we're
not
sufficiently
confident
of
our
ability
to
give
them
operational
significance
so
that
they
can
be
utilized
in
the
courtrooms
throughout
the
land
without
merely
being
a
façade
for
the
particular
views
of
the
particular
psychiatrist,
that
this
court
ought
not
yet
to
adopt
such
insanity
standards.
in
any
event,
if
the
constitutional
issue
which
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
is
indeed
reached
in
this
case,
we
would
agree
that
the
cases
of
the
most
vital
interest
not
only
to
the
minority
of
chronic
alcoholics
but
to
the
entire
american
society.
and
we
believe
that
we
plead
on
their
behalf.
thank
you.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am
informed
that
they
do
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
am
informed
they
have
a
commitment
statute
permitting
the
commitment
of
alcoholics.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
don't
have
personal
knowledge
of
that.
i
asked
my
associate
here
who
is
an
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
of
texas
that
question
and
he
was
uncertain.
he
knew
that
there
was
a
compulsory
commitment
provision
and
he
knew
that
it
was
possible
for
an
alcoholic
to
request
commitment
and
receive
commitment
to
a
texas
state
hospital.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
informed
that
the
states
have
statutes
with
relating
to
civil
commitment
of
alcoholics
to
quite
generally
and
that
they
typically
limit
the
term
of
permissible
commitment
between
30
--
between
i
think
either
30
or
i
think
between
90
days
and
three
years.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
court
would
do.
i
guess
that
was
the
problem
in
the
lynch
case
which
was
before
this
court.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
appeal
is
a
more
narrow
one
and
in
view
of
the
last
statements
of
counsel
for
amici,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
case
raises
the
constitutional
question
they
wish
to
raise
at
all.
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
whether
an
excessive
drinker
who
has
the
ability
to
abstain
may
be
convicted
of
public
intoxication
consistently
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now
if
indeed
it
is
conceded
that
a
person
who
has
the
power
to
abstain
would
not
be
subject
to
this
constitutional
immunity,
we
feel
that
this
case
does
not
raise
the
question
sought
at
all.
the
record
is
very
short.
the
critical
witness
on
the
question
of
the
appellant's
ability
to
abstain
was
the
only
psychiatrist
called,
he
was
called
by
the
defendant.
the
psychiatrist,
the
dr.david
wade
who
was
amply
qualified
as
an
expert
in
the
field
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
alcoholics
for
a
period
of
over
25
years,
did
testify
on
direct
examination
that
the
appellant
has
an
uncontrollable
compulsion
to
drink
and
that
his
going
in
public
is
involuntary.
however,
on
cross-examination
this
general
assertion
was
substantially
qualified
and
clarified,
and
i'm
reading
form
the
record
on
page
26,
referring
to
the
appellant.
question
“but
at
the
time
that
he
takes
the
first
drink
from
a
sober
condition,
would
you
say
that
it
is
a
voluntary
exercise
of
his
will?”
answer
“yes.
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
yes,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
must
take
into
account”
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
reading
on
page
26
of
the
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
and
we
must
take
into
account
that
these
individuals
have
a
compulsion
and
this
compulsion
while
not
completely
overpowering
is
a
very
strong
influence
and
exceedingly
strong
influence.
and
this
compulsion
coupled
with
the
firm
belief
in
their
mind
that
they're
going
to
be
able
to
handle
it
from
now
on
causes
their
judgment
to
be
somewhat
clouded.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am,
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
is,
obviously,
we
are
not
completely
pleased
with
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
gather
that
texas
has
a
practice
which
in
my
own
experience
is
i
would
say
unusual
of
allowing
counsel
who
does
not
prevail
to
submit
proposed
findings
of
fact.
in
this
case,
defense
counsel
submitted
proposed
findings
of
fact
on
the
afternoon
this
case
was
tried
and
the
judge
signed
them.
but
our
position
is
that
there's
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
lack
power
to
abstain
from
drinking
entirely.
although
we
do
concede
that
there's
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
a
conclusion
that
he
could
not
drink
moderately,
the
ones
he
started
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he
has
a
record
of
73
arrests
over
a
period
of
16
years
which
is
to
say
of
being
arrested
between
four
and
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
that
this
person
frequently
drank
to
excess.
there's
no
doubt
about
that
at
all,
but
the
astonishing
thing
is
that
some
people
do
want
to
drink
to
excess
occasionally
and
sometimes
even
frequently,
that
some
people
do
want
to
adopt
a
way
of
life
involving
excessive
use
of
alcohol.
now
it
is
quite
common
to
characterize
that
as
loss
of
control
because
the
person
doing
the
characterizing
is
ordinarily
evaluating
them
from
quite
a
different
set
of
values.
the
expert
says
“well
if
i
were
that
guy,
i
would
not
continue
to
drink
in
view
of
the
consequences
on
his
total
life,
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
the
man's
behavior
is
involuntary.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
studies
by
interview
of
these
people,
indicate
that
many
of
them
say
“i
like
to
drink”
and
many
of
them
say
“i've
never
tried
to
stop”
but
ought
that
to
immunize
them.
now
the
record
in
this
case
also
includes
a
statement
of
dr.wade
in
terms
of
his
taking
the
history
of
the
appellant
that
the
appellant
had
never
been
referred
to
alcoholics
anonymous.
he
didn't
go
beyond
that,
but
i
assume
by
that,
that
he
was
being
polite
in
saying
that
the
defendant
had
not
sought
the
help
of
alcoholics
anonymous.
well
why
not?
i
assume
that
the
defendant
for
whatever
reason
had
a
desire
to
continue
his
present
way
of
life.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
we're
prepared
to
make
a
constitutional
argument
even
accepting
the
findings
of
fact.
may
i
allude
to
that
in
just
a
moment?
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
appellant
did
make
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
court
can
go
behind
those
findings
of
fact
your
honor
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
in
the
first
place,
they're
not
findings
of
specific
historical
fact.
they
are
conclusions
which
are
interfused
with
standards
which
are
proposed
for
constitutional
adjudication.
the
first
two
findings
of
fact,
the
critical
ones,
are
very
generalized
statements
about
the
nature
of
chronic
alcoholism.
so
it
seems
to
me
they're
--
they
contain
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
about
as
much
law
as
fact,
and
furthermore,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
is
capable
of
taking
judicial
notice
of
facts
of
this
sort.
i
would
think
it
astonishing
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
believe
that
the
court
is
the
position
to
become
as
much
experts
in
alcoholism
as
the
trial
court
was
in
texas.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i'd
like
to
answer
your
honor,
but
i
have
no
information
on
which
to
make
any
statement.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
this
is
a
case
or
i
believe
this
is
a
case
on
appeal
your
honor,
and
how
many
drunks
it
gets,
i
do
not
know.
it
was
appealed
from
the
lower
court
to
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
to
what
i
assume
is
a
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
he
saw
the
petitioner,
right.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he
did
see
him.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
not
seen
him.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
believe
conclusions
with
respect
to
volitional
capacity
are
not
or
cannot
be
made
on
the
basis
of
seeing
someone.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
we
assert
these
findings
are
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
medical
witness
was
being
extremely
careful
on
cross-examination
and
he
explained
himself
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
direct
examination
was
primarily
conducted
by
leading
questions.
i
think
he
was
trying
--
i
assume
he
was
trying
to
give
honest
answers
to
both
counsel
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
i
do
think
that
the
cross-examination
is
significant.
i
think
it's
also
significant
that
during
the
redirect
examination,
there
was
no
attempt
the
physician's
statement
on
cross-examination.
now
the
defendant,
at
one
time,
was
asked
“can
you
stop
drinking”
and
he
said
“no.”
that's
the
only
other
evidence
in
the
record,
but
i
would
say
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
question
because
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
that
means
stop
after
you
start
or
stop
in
the
sense
of
completely
abstaining.
now
it's
my
understanding
that
typical
members
of
alcoholics
anonymous
for
example
characterize
loss
of
control
as
loss
of
control
after
they
take
their
first
drink.
and
dr.wade
was
making
this
statement
not
only
with
respect
to
the
appellant
but
with
respect
--
he
said
the
appellant
was
fairly
typical
of
alcoholics.
and
we
have
other
authorities
who
also
indicate
that
the
dominant
form
of
american
alcoholism
contains
this
phenomenon,
namely
an
inability
to
drink
moderately
but
an
ability
to
completely
abstain.
as
to
the
finding
--
well
i
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
contend
that
even
if
the
findings
are
sustained
that
the
conviction
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no.
well
perhaps
yes
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
have
to
change
my
answer
and
say
yes
on
the
basis
that
the
trail
court
stated.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
defendant's
--
the
appellant's
argument
seems
to
us
to
be
this,
that
there
exists
a
disease
and
i
get
the
impression
that
is
looked
upon
almost
a
unitary
disease
called
chronic
alcoholism.
and
that
this
destroyed
his
will
to
abstain,
his
will
to
drink
moderately,
his
will
to
avoid
appearing
in
public
in
a
condition
of
intoxication
and
therefore
he
ought
to
be
treated
not
as
a
responsible
human
being
but
rather
as
an
ill
person
who
is
acting
without
volition.
at
the
outset,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
this
argument,
if
accepted
by
the
court,
would
have
revolutionary
implications
for
the
criminal
law.
for
example,
the
alcoholic
driver
who
drives
to
another
bar
or
to
a
liquor
store
to
get
a
bottle
of
liquor
would
presumably
have
a
defense
of
chronic
alcoholism
to
a
charge
of
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
or
even
perhaps
to
negligent
homicide.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
if
we
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
not
in
every
situation,
but
where
there's
a
close
cause
or
relation
between
his
chronic
alcoholism
and
the
crime
for
which
he's
charged,
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
would
also
has
to
be
shown
presumably
an
adequate
cause
or
relationship
between
his
alcoholism
and
his
robbery
or
rape.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
but
i'm
assuming
that.
assuming
that,
but
i
agree.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
assuming
an
adequate
relationship
between
the
homicide
and
his
drive
to
get
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
a
ruling
on
the
basis
of
the
sort
of
volitional
criteria
that
they
suggest
as
a
basis
for
constitutional
adjudication
would
have
that
consequence.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
volitional
criteria,
by
that
i
meant
requiring
volition
in
some
sense
independent
of
his
drive
to
obtain
liquor.
i'm
not
disputing
it
here
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
the
principle
which
they
urge
would
also
a
fortiori
be
applicable
to
crimes
by
a
narcotic
cabinet.
immediately
go
on
presumably
would
be
the
possession
of
narcotic
statute
to
which
under
the
uniform
narcotics
act
is
fairly
general
throughout
the
nation.
if
the
person
accused
were
a
narcotics
addict
and
presumably
sale
of
narcotics
by
an
addict
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
also
be
exculpated.
and
theft
and
prostitution
and
robbery
by
an
addict
in
order
to
support
his
habit
would
presumably
also,
under
the
principle
urged
here,
be
exculpated.
now
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
alcoholism
and
other
crimes,
we
have
not
--
we
have
presented
some
information
in
our
brief
on
page
17
and
18
a
long
study
in
columbus,
ohio
indicated
64
persons
who
were
arrested
for
felonies
were
intoxicated.
now
that
was
not
necessarily
chronic
alcoholics.
it
would
include
presumably
some
chronic
alcoholics
and
undetermined
member.
in
the
study
in
sing
sing
prison
indicated
that
22%
of
their
prisoners
were
habitually
tampered.
well
there
is
a
strong
relationship
between
alcohol
and
other
crimes
because
as
is
well
known
it
does
relax
one's
inhibitions.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
we're
only
talking
about
harmless
passive
skid
row
derelicts
because
the
range
of
chronic
alcoholics
or
people
diagnosed
chronic
alcoholics
extends
through
all
types
of
personalities;
sociopaths,
passive
aggressive
personality,
schizophrenics,
etcetera.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
homogenous
group.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that
yes
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that
must
be
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
that's
their
position,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
would
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am
not
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
information
your
honor
with
respect
to
that.
i
am
not
a
resident
of
texas
myself.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
information
on
that
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
deal
specifically
with
the
allegation
that
alcoholism
is
a
disease
because
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
follow
your
honor,
as
i
understand
existing
law
being
intoxicated
is
if
indeed
the
evidence
suggest
a
intoxication
produced
a
lack
of
specific
intent.
as
i
understand
existing
law,
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime
requiring
specific
intent.
in
other
words
his
intoxication
at
present
has
evidentiary
significance.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
position,
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
whether
the
robbery
was
in
some
sense
a
product
of
his
chronic
alcoholism.
now
what
that
might
mean,
i
suppose
would
depend
upon
further
decisions
of
the
court.
but
under
the
carter
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
similar
matter
was
litigated,
they
said
that
the
crime
would
be
a
product
of
a
mental
disease
if
it
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
mental
disease,
which
is
to
say
a
very
little
cause
or
relationship
was
required.
and
indeed
the
cause
or
relationship
had
to
be
negative
by
the
prosecution
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
order
for
the
man
to
be
convicted.
so
i
would
think
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
exculpate
a
robbery
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
principle
on
which
the
appellant
seeks
an
adjudication
in
his
favor
is
a
principle
that
goes
far
beyond
the
crime
of
public
intoxication.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
it
seems
for
example
in
the
case
of
--
the
easiest
case
i
suppose
is
of
a
narcotics
addict
who
was
charged
for
illegal
possession
of
narcotics.
now
i
assume
that
a
principle
which
says
that
in
addiction
to
alcohol
is
a
disease
which
destroys
a
man's
ability
to
control
his
behavior
and
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
it
does
follow
from
robinson
against
california,
but
the
critical
importance
of
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
it
seeks
to
extend
robinson
versus
california
to
exculpate
with
respect
to
crimes
of
behavior.
robinson
versus
california
was
not
a
crime
of
delinquent
behavior.
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
extend
robinson
to
a
crime
of
delinquent
behavior
and
we
say
that
principle
has
few
stopping
places.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that
would
be
behavior
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
when
one
lies
across
the
sidewalk
that
would
likely
be
–
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
according
to
the
record
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
assume
that's
correct.
i
assume
that's
correct
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
behavior
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
which
is
inseparable
under
the
theory
proposed
would
include
such
things
as
littering
the
streets,
becoming
incontinent,
becoming
ill
sick
to
one's
stomach,
abusing
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
pardon
me?
oh!
i
think
that
in
other
words
i
think
that
this
statute
has
a
prophylactic
function
in
the
sense
that
even
though
this
man
at
present
may
not
be
staggering
out
in
front
of
a
car.
or
even
though
at
present
may
not
be
cursing
pedestrians
or
walking
by,
he
can
be
removed
from
the
street
before
these
things
occur.
and
i
think
too
there
are
aesthetic
aspects
to
this
type
of
prohibition
which
are
of
importance
to
many
americans.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
being
in
a
sort
of
bowery
type
of
atmosphere
is
extremely
disturbing
to
many
people.
i
think
many
people
would
prefer
to
have
their
communities
not
be
this
way.
but
i
think
there's
a
substantial
aesthetic
element
in
this
specific
crime
which
we're
involved
with
here.
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
we've
made
some
sort
of
attempt
in
our
brief
to
state
our
position
and
i
won't
say
much
more
except
this,
that
when
we
use
disease
in
this
context,
we're
not
using
it
in
the
context
of
something
which
is
capable
of
scientific
verification
that
it
is
or
is
not
a
disease.
the
american
psychiatric
association
has
--
my
note
on
that
escapes
me
for
the
moment,
but
the
american
psychiatric
association
calls
alcoholism
a
personality
disorder.
a
class
which
includes
disorders
of
psychogenic
origin
or
without
clearly
defined
tangible
cause
or
structural
chain.
academic
psychiatrists
who
are
the
only
people
i
gather
frequently
ask
themselves
seriously
what
do
psychiatrists
mean
by
disease,
although
occasionally
it's
required
now
in
medical
–
in
legal
contexts
as
well,
indicate
that
what
we
mean
by
disease
is
disorderly
behavior
or
deviant
behavior
i
should
say.
that
the
classification
of
disease
within
which
it
maybe
asserted
that
chronic
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
in
other
words,
is
not
a
category
which
precludes
criminality.
it's
a
category
which
overlaps
criminality
because
the
psychiatrists
are
also
concerned
with
deviant
behavior.
well
why
then
is
there
so
much
concern
whether
it's
a
disease
or
it
isn't
a
disease?
well
we
suggest
there's
concern
because
disease
has
so
much
emotional
force.
you
find
various
groups
interested
in
achieving
with
respect
to
alcoholic
saying
alcoholism
is
a
disease,
alcoholism
a
disease.
the
reason
they're
doing
this
is
not
because
this
is
a
descriptively
meaningful
statement,
but
because
they
realize
it
has
this
emotional
force.
now
as
to
chronic
alcoholism
as
itself,
as
the
court
--
as
some
members
of
the
court
have
noted,
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
different
types
of
definitions
frequently
framed
in
terms
of
social
deviancy.
for
example
endangering
public
moral,
safety
and
welfare,
or
altering
his
--
interfering
with
his
mental
health
etcetera.
now
it
is
quite
true
that
there
is
commonly
in
a
definition,
although
not
always,
an
indication
that
the
criterion
is
whether
a
man
can
control,
whether
he
can
control
his
behavior
with
respect
to
drinking.
however,
how
can
we
determine
whether
a
person
can
control
his
behavior?
it
is
said
“well
you
can't
ask
him
because
alcoholics
are
can
not
frequently
to
be
depended
upon
to
give
away
--“
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
the
findings
mean
your
honor.
in
other
words,
assuming
a
person
is
said
to
lack
ability
to
control
what
is
meant
by
this.
it's
not
something
which
can
be
observed
and
scientifically
demonstrated.
as
far
as
i
can
see
what
it
really
means
is
that
the
expert
from
the
standpoint
of
his
values
or
for
what
--
or
from
the
standpoint
of
what
he
assumes
to
be
community
values
is
believing
that
the
individual
is
acting
unwisely.
now
i
that
judge
bazelon
was
coming
to
that
point
in
the
washington
case
which
we
just
decided
at
the
end
of
last
year.
that
when
the
psychiatrist
was
talking
in
terms
of
behavior
controls,
he
said
this
was
largely
merely
a
façade
with
respect
to
the
moral
judgments
of
the
psychiatrist.
if
you
say
in
the
ultimate
sense
on
the
basis
of
this
person's
whole
life
history
that
you
can
--
that
it
seems
likely
that
he
will
continue
to
drink.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
said
with
respect
to
criminality
in
general
if
you
assume,
as
psychiatrists
tend
to
assume,
that
people
are
controlled
by
their
prior
histories
and
their
genetic
equivalent.
we
attempted
to
make
our
position
clear
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
assertion
that
the
criminal
law
only
ought
to
apply
to
people
who
act
because
of
freewill.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
controversy
that
is
not
essential
to
constitutional
adjudication
of
who
is
to
be
criminally
responsible
and
who
is
not
to
be
criminally
responsible.
it
is
clear
to
us
that
the
criminal
law
traditionally
has
not
required
free
will.
for
example,
typical
insanity
test
have
not
required
freewill
and
even
the
durham
rule
does
not
necessarily
require
freewill
if
mental
disease
is
thought
to
have
some
significance
beyond
volitional
criteria.
furthermore,
the
criminal
law
hasn't
said
to
a
person
who
is
uncontrollably
angry
and
who's
charged
with
homicide
that
you
were
to
be
exculpated
because
you
didn't
have
freewill.
we
believe
that
the
criminal
law
is
rational
as
applied
to
even
a
chronic
alcoholic
for
it
includes
givig
him
an
opportunity
for
food,
clothing,
shelter
or
period
of
compulsory
continence.
the
d.c.crime
report
indicated
that
the
health
of
chronic
alcoholics
in
the
district
had
markedly
deteriorated
following
the
easter
decision.
now,
it
may
be
as
additional
facilities
are
brought
to
bear
that
things
will
get
better,
but
it
seems
that
that
is
a
completely
or
is
a
largely
unpredictable
matter
because
we
don't
have
very
much
experience
with
alternative
facilities
in
this
country.
now
we
don't
have
very
much
experience
as
to
how
much
for
example
cooperation
alcoholics
would
give
if
voluntary
facilities
are
made
available
to
them.
counsel
for
the
appellants
cited
the
experience
recently
in
saint
louis
in
which
he
indicated
that
95%
of
the
alcoholics
referred
to
their
detoxification
center,
had
stayed
there
as
long
as
the
doctors
wanted
them
to.
actually
the
figure
was
97%,
however
the
maximum
stay
there
was
only
seven
days.
and
we
don't
--
and
these
were
alcoholics
who
were
threatened
with
criminal
prosecution
if
they
left.
presumably,
that
would
not
be
allowed
if
the
court
decides
as
appellant
requests
here.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
is
quite
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
was
talking
about
their
reference
to
saint
louis
statistics
with
respect
to
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
cooperation
of
alcoholics.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
as
i
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
read
the
article
to
which
they
referred
and
it
was
an
article
by
a
person
that
has
some
responsibility
for
the
program
and
i
assume
that
he
would
not
do
it
injustice
and
he
indicated
that
if
they
didn't
cooperate
with
the
seven-day
detoxification
that
they
were
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
in
the
saint
louis.
well
under
those
circumstances
he
indicated
97%
did
stay
there
as
long
as
the
doctors
wanted.
now
it
may
be
also
that
the
doctors
said
“well
if
you
want
to
leave
i'll
let
you
leave”
so
some
left
earlier
anyway.
our
experience
with
respect
to
voluntary
clinics
does
not
provide
a
particular
basis
for
optimism.
with
respect
to
people
who
voluntarily
seek
help,
according
to
one
recent
study,
50%
of
alcoholic
patients
after
one
contact
with
voluntary
clinic
did
not
reappear.
i
don't
believe
that
i
have
the
study
which
i
want
to
refer
to.
i
think
was
stated
slightly
too
strongly.
the
study
i
had
indicated
i
think
about
33%
left
after
their
initial
visit
and
about
75%
after
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
there're
some
other
statitics
indicated
in
the
appellant's
brief
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
in
both
the
opening
appellant's
brief
and
the
reply
appellant's
brief
figures
in
the
neighborhood
of
50%
of
cured,
or
aided,
or
arrested
alcoholics
are
cited.
however,
if
you
will
examine
the
context
of
these
figures,
you
will
find
that
these
do
not
refer
to
populations
of
skid
row
alcoholics
the
sort
of
person
who
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
in
this
case.
the
one
congressional
record
citation
which
is
given
was
changed
in
the
edited
version
of
the
congressional
version,
i
assume,
because
it
made
it
clear
that
it
was
referring
to
a
hospital
population
and
not
to
a
population
to
persons
who
are
being
arrested
for
public
intoxication.
united
states
public
health
service
came
up
with
quite
different
figures
in
a
recent
study,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
namely
that
it
was
thought
unlikely
that
more
than
10-12%
could
be
even
aided,
even
aided
and
aided
may
only
mean
that
a
person
decided
to
stay
sober
a
little
bit
more
often.
well
it
may
be
that
things
would
be
much
better
than
that,
it
may
be,
but
we
do
not
yet
have
the
data
to
know.
we
have
just
the
beginnings
of
various
programs
which
do
not
provide
the
basis.
it
seems
to
us,
for
constitutional
adjudication
which
would
have
the
effect
of
terminating
existing
program.
with
respect
to
the
robinson's
case
itself,
we've
attempted
to
deal
with
it
in
our
brief.
we
feel
it
does
not
reach
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
it
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
it
doesn't
indicate
the
way
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
we
think
there
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
--
we
think
there
are
values
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
we
feel
there
are
values
in
the
present
system.
we're
believers
in
the
criminal
law.
in
other
words,
the
notion
of
taking
a
person
off
the
street
for
four
or
five
days,
as
this
--
as
the
appellant
was
taken
off
the
street
for
four
or
five
days.
and
given
the
opportunity
for
at
least
physical
rehabilitation
and
then
released
and
allowed
to
go
as
he
pleases
has
some
valuable
to
appellant
and
to
the
city
of
austin,
texas.
it
avoids
many
of
the
problems
of
creating
a
bowery
in
the
city
of
austin,
texas
and
it
offers
some
advantages
to
the
appellant.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
$50
fine
i
suppose
is
less
arguably
of
benefit
to
the
appellant.
however,
i
gather
that
the
$50
was
not
commonly
paid
by
the
appellant
from
what
was
said,
although
i
don't
know
that
the
record
supports
that.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
what
the
evidence
suggests,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
he
would,
yes.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
if
he
were
to
have
to
pay
the
$50
fine
that
would
be
punishment
that
punishment
again
presumably
includes
some
other
objectives.
for
example
it
might,
if
he
were
able
to
pay
it
or
if
a
person
were
able
to
pay
it,
it
might
make
them
more
inclined
to
drink
at
home.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
is
that
is
what
your
honor?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
only
penalty
permitted
by
the
texas
statute
is
a
fine.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
he's
been
arrested
73
times.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
don't
follow
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes,
he
had
been
locked
up
in
jail
before.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
if
he
didn't
have
the
$50,
presumably
he
would
not
pay
the
$50.00
and
that
would
not
deter
him
from
drinking.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
and
he
would
go
to
jail.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
the
chances
are
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
still
--
if
by
in
a
sense
it
is
punishment,
but
i
don't
think
it's
purely
retributive
punishment.
in
other
words,
to
a
person
that
has
$50
presumably
that's
some
incentive
to
the
individual
not
to
appear
in
public
in
a
state
of
intoxication.
to
the
person
that
does
not
have
the
$50
there
are
advantages
in
a
period
of
confinement.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
that's
his
case.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
think
that
there's
an
equal
protection
issue.
it
is
not
been
raised
and
i've
not
attempted
to
research
it.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
see
an
issue
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
robinson
case
and
the
driver
case
and
the
easter
case,
we
will
rely
on
what
we've
said
in
our
brief.
there
are
some
cases
on
the
other
side
which
are
also
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
the
hoyt
case
in
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
michigan
held
that
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
require
a
result
of
the
sort
argued
for
here.
in
the
narcotics
area,
the
cases
seem
to
be
unanimous
and
not
extending
robinson
beyond
its
limitations
to
include
behavior
with
respect
to
narcotics.
it
seems
to
me
they're
all
against
the
principle
which
is
urged
here.
with
respect
to
the
--
with
--
the
presidential
crime
commission
did
as
appellant
states
recommend
that
public
drunkenness
not
itself
be
a
crime
that
the
principle
that
they
espouse
is
far
more
limited
than
the
one
here
because
for
example
they
recommended
the
disorderly
conduct
continue
to
be
a
crime.
but
on
a
purely
involitional
principle
which
we're
talking
about
here,
it
would
seem
that
the
disorderly
conduct
would
also
fall
and
indeed
mr.
hutt
has
made
that
argument
on
other
occasions.
with
respect
to
the
possibilities
of
achieving
youthful
social
reform
by
forbidding
a
continuation
of
the
present
system,
it
seems
to
us
a
number
of
questions
ought
to
be
asked.
one
question
we've
already
addressed
ourselves
to
and
that's
the
question
of
what
are
the
chances
of
improvement.
if
indeed
we
are
not
likely
to
get
substantial
improvement
with
respect
of
a
lot
of
alcoholics
by
referring
them
either
to
the
streets
or
to
alternative
facilities,
it
seems
that
that
would
be
a
reason
not
to
force
this
sort
of
a
program
across
the
nation.
one
thing
that
would
be
helpful
to
know
for
example
is
how
many
chronic
alcoholics
change
their
way
of
life
under
present
practice.
we
don't
really
know
this.
we
know
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
that
don't
that
we
don't
have
studies
that
indicate
what
the
incidence
is
of
those
who
do.
and
we
don't
have
studies
indicating
what
the
comparative
results
are
between
a
detoxification
approach
of
a
few
days
detoxification
as
in
a
medical
facility
compared
to
a
few
days
detoxification
in
a
jail.
somehow,
detoxification
has
a
much
more
pleasant
sound,
but
essentially
detoxification
is
an
opportunity
for
a
person
to
sober
up
i
assume.
i
would
be
very
interested
in
studies
which
are
now
for
example
being
undertaken
with
respect
to
the
saint
louis
experiment.
i
understand
that
since
studies
are
being
done
by
washington
university
at
saint
louis,
however
we
don't
have
the
results
of
those
studies
yet.
mr.
hutt
says
there's
a
bowery
project
that's
been
inaugurated,
be
interesting
to
find
out
what
the
success
of
that
program
is,
but
we
don't
have
any
information
yet,
and
there's
some
studies
in
other
cities
as
well.
well,
ultimately
we
submit,
society
is
faced
with
a
series
of
possible
choices
in
terms
of
what
ought
to
be
done
with
respect
to
skid
row
alcoholic.
we
feel
that
there
are
three
essential
alternatives
which
are
before
society.
now
one
is
that
the
present
procedures
continued
to
be
allowed
that
criminal
or
civil
processes
be
allowed
with
respect
to
alcoholics
and
in
some
communities
essentially
leaving
them
alone
would
continue
to
be
allowed.
and
this
would
include
probation
programs
and
various
other
types
of
programs
which
are
tied
to
the
criminal
process.
however,
the
appellant
urges
that
well
the
criminal
process
itself
ought
to
be
forbidden
in
part
because
jails
are
frequently
badly
ran
institutions.
well
we
feel
that
here
is
a
real
opportunity
for
the
notion
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
its
traditional
sense.
if
indeed
jails
in
some
communities
are
badly
run
institutions
then
it
would
seem
to
us
appropriate
that
those
jails
be
thought
to
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
in
a
historically
sanctioned
sense.
and
that
those
facilities
would
not
be
continued
to
be
used
not
only
by
habitual
alcoholics
but
by
any
other
people
who
are
subject
to
penal
confinement.
a
second
alternative
is
to
permit
civil
commitment
only
and
i
gather
this
is
commonly
in
approach
which
is
appealing
to
the
medical
profession.
it
is
frequently
thought
that
people
who
are
heavily
committed
to
drugs
or
to
alcohol
can
not
be
cured
under
that
patient
basis.
they
have
to
be
taken
to
an
environment
where
there's
more
control
that
the
environment
ought
to
be
continued
until
the
processes
of
attempted
pretreatment
can
be
continued.
the
model
for
this
approach
to
the
treatment
of
alcoholics
would
be
the
state
mental
hospital
or
the
juvenile
detention
facility.
objectives
of
treatment
and
isolation
would
indeed
be
served.
however,
in
spite
of
the
eagerness
of
some
people
to
funnel
people
to
civil
facilities
and
indeed
of
course
this
has
been
the
approaches
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
california
following
the
decision
of
the
robinson
case
with
respect
to
narcotics
addict.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
some
real
problems
with
respect
to
that.
we
feel
that
the
criminal
process
has
great
advantages
in
terms
of
the
specificity
of
the
charge
which
must
be
levied,
the
specificity
of
the
statutory
proscription
that
a
person
can
not
merely
be
confined
on
the
basis
of
some
person
feeling
that
he
is
ill
under
the
vega's
criteria
and
that
he
requires
treatment.
and
we
feel
that
the
specificity
of
sentence
also
has
an
advantage.
there's
an
advantage
in
the
fact
the
defendant
after
four
days
in
jail
would
get
out
of
jail.
his
disturbance
of
austin
society
was
not
so
great
as
to
justify
indefinite
incarceration
and
the
criminal
process
had
the
advantages
compared
to
the
civil
process,
it
seems
to
us,
in
not
permitting
for
his
own
good
and
under
a
theory
of
benevolence,
indefinite
in
incarceration
is
as
frequently
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
commitment
approaches
to
treatment.
it
seems
to
us,
in
other
words
that
the
experience
in
the
galt
case
where
we
had
probably,
i
suppose
by
and
large
a
much
more
tractable
population
that
we
were
dealing
with
in
terms
of
juvenile
delinquents
than
we
do
with
respect
to
people
whose
long
time
drinking
habits
have
caused
them
to
be
characterized
as
chronic
alcoholics
by
and
large,
should
make
us
very
wary
of
saying
to
the
medical
profession
“well
you
take
these
people
over
and
treat
them
if
you
will.”
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
galt
case,
it
seems
to
us,
to
involve
an
inquiry
into
what
has
happened
in
another
area
of
deviant
behavior
where
there's
been
an
effort
to
terminate
the
criminal
process
and
replace
it
by
a
therapeutic
approach
with
long
term
treatment
available
without
specific
criteria
as
to
the
amount
of
social
damage
which
is
been
caused.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
third
approach
is
the
approach
which
i
gather
is
essentially
urged
here
by
the
appellant
and
by
the
aclu,
although
not
by
the
philadelphia
amicus
and
that
is
terminate
the
possibilities
of
compulsory
criminal
control,
terminate
the
possibilities
of
compulsory
civil
control
and
allow
chronic
alcoholics
if
they
wish
to
remain
on
the
street.
now
this
is
largely
the
approach
which
has
been
followed
in
the
city
of
new
york
for
many,
many
years
and
there
it
led
to
the
bowery.
we
believe
that
this
would
have
unfortunate
consequences
both
as
a
quality
of
american
urban
life
and
also
unfortunate
consequences
in
terms
of
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
chronic
alcoholics
themselves.
in
summary,
our
position
is
that
we
ought
not
now
in
terms
of
the
information
available,
and
in
terms
of
to
be
prepared
descript.
the
devices
for
social
control
and
the
criminal
processes
with
respect
to
chronic
alcoholics,
and
we
ought
not
now
to
devote
to
adopt
the
principle
which
would
clearly
apply
not
only
to
alcoholic
offenders
but
also
to
narcotic
offenders,
and
indeed
to
many
other
types
of
offenders.
sociopaths,
for
example,
are
frequently
defined
in
terms
of
lack
of
behavior
control
and
their
crimes
ran
the
whole
gamut
as
the
court
knows
of
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
no
your
honor
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
he
appellant
be
arrested
for
being
a
chronic
alcoholic.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
we
suggest
that
when
he
appears
drunk
in
a
public
place
that
he
be
subject
to
arrest.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
just
a
little
cookie?
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
would
suppose
it
would
depend
upon
what
is
deviant
behavior
it
was.
if
it
was
covered
by
a
criminal
proscription,
i
assume
that
he
would
be
--
i
would
hope
that
he
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
process,
if
it
weren't
--
if
that
weren't
the
case
and
i
would
just
hope
that
he
would
not
be
subject
to
criminal
process.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
would
agree
your
honor.
i
would
--
my
point
is
that
the
principle
urged
here
and
i
--
that
in
terms
of
a
principle
decision,
the
principle
here
would
immediately
reach
the
sort
of
substantial
public
nuisances
that
i've
been
talking
about.
now
it's
possible
to
adopt
a
different
principle
namely
that
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
i
could
--
i
agreed
to
the
statute
would
apply
to
people
whose
behavior
was
not
markedly
disorderly.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
the
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
principle
which
is
urged
as
a
basis
for
the
constitutional
adjudication
by
this
court
does
indeed
reach
disorderly
conduct.
now,
i
can
agree
that
there
are
possibilities
through
other
principles
of
limiting
the
reach
of
the
sort
of
decision
which
the
appellant
seek.
for
example,
i
could
imagine
that
it
could
be
thought
that
the
social
objective
with
respect
to
removing
chronic
alcoholics
themselves
did
not
justify
their
incarceration,
but
the
social
objectives
with
respect
to
chronics
alcoholics
who
for
example
were
uttering
obscenities
might
indeed
justify
subjecting
them
to
the
criminal
process.
but
the
difference
between
those
two
cases
seems
to
us
not
to
be
in
terms
of
their
analysis
of
the
principle
they
suggest
whether
one
is
more
volitional
than
the
other.
it
seems
so
us
in
--
that
the
case
goes
not
only
to
the
alcoholic,
to
the
addict,
to
the
sociopath
etcetera
but
that
the
case
essentially
asks
this
court
to
adopt
standards
for
criminal
insanity
which
would
be
of
a
constitutional
dimension
would
be
applicable
throughout
the
nation.
because
again
the
principle
they
urge
is
one
which
requires
a
volitional
insanity
test,
it
seems
to
us,
namely
they
urge
that
a
person
whose
behavior
is
the
product
of
something
denominated
in
mental
illness
that
this
person
be
exculpated.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
they're
also
asking
for
the
abolition
of
the
insanity
test
currently
prevalent
in
most
of
the
states.
now,
without
arguing
the
pros
or
cons
of
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
evanescence
sort
of
standards
referring
to
behavior
controls
which
are
proposed
here,
at
least
we
don't
know
enough
about
them
and
we're
not
sufficiently
confident
of
our
ability
to
give
them
operational
significance
so
that
they
can
be
utilized
in
the
courtrooms
throughout
the
land
without
merely
being
a
façade
for
the
particular
views
of
the
particular
psychiatrist,
that
this
court
ought
not
yet
to
adopt
such
insanity
standards.
in
any
event,
if
the
constitutional
issue
which
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
is
indeed
reached
in
this
case,
we
would
agree
that
the
cases
of
the
most
vital
interest
not
only
to
the
minority
of
chronic
alcoholics
but
to
the
entire
american
society.
and
we
believe
that
we
plead
on
their
behalf.
thank
you.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
am
informed
that
they
do
--
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
well
i
am
informed
they
have
a
commitment
statute
permitting
the
commitment
of
alcoholics.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
don't
have
personal
knowledge
of
that.
i
asked
my
associate
here
who
is
an
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
of
texas
that
question
and
he
was
uncertain.
he
knew
that
there
was
a
compulsory
commitment
provision
and
he
knew
that
it
was
possible
for
an
alcoholic
to
request
commitment
and
receive
commitment
to
a
texas
state
hospital.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i'm
informed
that
the
states
have
statutes
with
relating
to
civil
commitment
of
alcoholics
to
quite
generally
and
that
they
typically
limit
the
term
of
permissible
commitment
between
30
--
between
i
think
either
30
or
i
think
between
90
days
and
three
years.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
court
would
do.
i
guess
that
was
the
problem
in
the
lynch
case
which
was
before
this
court.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
i
assume
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
robinson,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
