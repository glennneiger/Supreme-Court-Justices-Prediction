mr.
peter
barton
hutt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
like
to
defer
to
mr.
tom
davis,
a
member
of
this
bar
and
of
the
state
of
texas
bar
to
move
the
admission
as
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
nine
amici
curiae
who
are
filed
the
browns
colored
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
pose
one
qualification,
your
honor.
there
have
been
times
where
a
given
individual
was
arrested
as
the
u.s.
crime
commission
found
on
one
occasion,
some
31
times
in
four
months
largely
by
the
same
police
officer.
i
think
there
may
arise
on
occasion
where
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
arresting
officer's
discretion
where
he
obviously
has
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
would
necessarily
be
to
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
because
he
is
a
known
chronic
alcoholic,
for
example,
a
man
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
that
incident
took
place
who
had
been
adjudicated
by
court
to
be
a
chronic
alcoholic
and
had
been
acquitted
on
31
prior
occasions.
the
--
i
think
at
that
point
the
arresting
officer
if
he
knows
that
would
--
well
he
may
have
not
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
but
certainly
if
he
did
not
know
that
the
man
was
an
alcoholic,
i
would
agree
100%.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
as
i
say
your
honor,
i
am
not
an
authority
under
law
of
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
i
have
not
researched
that
in
detail.
i
merely
raised
that
as
one
possibility
that
certainly
the
u.s.
crime
commission
did
raise
a
question
about
it.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
did
not
discuss
it
in
constitutional
terms.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
certainly
do,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i'm
a
little
bit
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
am
troubled
by
your
analysis
a
little
bit,
and
i'd
like
to
use
the
analogy
to
the
insane.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
this
day
and
age
to
convict
an
insane
person
for
a
product
caused
by
his
insanity.
i
would
not
suggest
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
arrest
him
and
charge
him
with
a
crime.
therefore,
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
the
chief
justice
in
that
analysis.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
because
you
have
questions.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
--private
agencies
and
trained
or
professional
personnel
as
well
as
lay
persons.
they're
deeply
interested,
all
of
them,
in
improving
both
law
enforcement
and
the
standard
of
healthcare
in
our
society.
the
chief
justice
raised
the
question
just
before
we
adjourned,
about
the
lack
of
facilities
to
handle
the
public
inebriate
alcoholic
in
our
population.
i
can't
speak
specifically
for
the
state
of
the
argue
in
texas,
but
certainly
around
the
country,
the
amici
represent
the
people
who
would
have
to
take
up
the
slack
and
who
must
provide
that
treatment.
the
american
medical
association,
the
state
programs
in
alcoholism.
these
are
the
people
who
will
be
dealing
with
the
problem.
they're
prepared
to
undertake
the
treatment.
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
found
throughout
the
country
is
that
in
areas
where
the
jails
have
hidden
the
problem
up
to
now,
the
situation
is
very
poor.
there
is
a
lack
of
treatment,
but
as
soon
as
the
jails
are
not
used
to
hide
the
problem,
treatment
becomes
available
largely
to
a
better
use
of
existing
resources.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
we
think
it
unnecessary
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well
i
think
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
think
there
is
a
tenable
position
that
has
been
urged
to
the
court
in
the
brief
on
that
very
point.
we
think
it
unnecessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
we
think
this
presents
a
very
simple
case
of
an
illness.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
think
this
raises
a
very
important
question
of
what
this
means
to
a
community
with
a
ruling
that
is
handed
down,
for
example
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
philadelphia
and
atlanta,
georgia
and
in
the
fourth
circuit.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
court
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
holding
that
alcoholism
is
a
defense
to
the
charge
of
public
intoxication.
the
police
and
the
health
authorities
have
devised
plans
that
are
beginning
to
circumvent
the
arrest
process
completely.
we
now
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
as
to
any
person.
and
the
--
what
will
happen
is
that
these
people
as
recommended
by
the
u.s.
and
d.c.
crime
commissions
will
be
all
be
taken
directly
to
a
detoxification
center.
there
is
a
bill
in
congress
now
that
has
passed
the
house
of
representatives
that
repeals
the
district
of
columbia
public
intoxication
law.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
we
are
not
arguing
that
point
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
the
entire
issue
in
this
point,
in
this
case,
but
i
did
want
to
answer
the
question
that
was
posed.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
tremendous
reform,
and
frankly
those
are
the
reforms
that
the
amici
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
not
completely,
no.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
--
well
let
me
suggest
that
in
1960
--
fiscal
year
1966,
there
were
47,000
arrests
for
public
intoxication,
and
that
had
remained
steady
for
about
five
years.
in
fiscal
'67,
i
have
the
preliminary
figures
which
show
37,000
that's
a
decrease
--
of
10,000
arrests.
i
would
suggest,
and
that
was
before
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
do
not.
atlanta
was
notorious
as
being
worst
than
the
district
of
columbia
in
terms
of
arrest
and
i
have
no
information
on
that
area
or
philadelphia.
but
philadelphia,
the
diagnostic
and
relocation
center
has
submitted
both
a
brief
to
this
court
which
i
believe
is
a
yellow
colored
brief,
and
also
a
report
of
a
10-day
study
entitled
alternatives
to
arrest,
which
points
out
that
what
the
way
they
obviously
would
head
under
their
decision
would
be
to
circumvent
the
entire
arrest
problem.
i
would
like
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
at
the
present
time
your
honor?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
the
authority
and
at
this
at
one
time
was
debated
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
whether
there
was
a
common
law
authority
to
pick
up
an
incapacitated
drunk
on
the
street
and
take
him
to
a
health
--
to
a
hospital.
in
the
d.c.
crime
commission
report,
the
commissioner's
unanimously
concluded
that
there
was
common
law
authority
to
do
this
under
the
--
as
a
civil
law
matter
and
that
it
would
not
constitute
a
criminal
arrest.
they
used
the
example
of
taking
an
insane
person
or
a
heart
attack
victim
to
a
hospital.
nevertheless,
they
went
on
to
say
that
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
this
and
if
the
police
were
concerned,
certainly
the
police
should
be
protected
by
a
statute.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
right.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
say
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
think,
the
way
i
would
analyze
it
and
this
is
my
personal
view
point,
is
that
the
state
is
justified
in
intervening
in
a
parens
patriae
view
or
rather
role
anytime
that
the
individual
is
incapacitated
for
any
reason,
whether
it's
drunkenness
and
whether
he's
an
alcoholic
or
not.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
but
that
once
he
becomes
in
a
position
where
he
is,
you
might
say
sufficiently
in
possession
of
its
faculties
to
make
a
rational
decision
which
has
to
be
a
medical
judgment
that
he
should
be
allowed
either
to
leave
or
to
stay.
now
i
think
it's
interesting
that
in
the
places
where
detoxification
had
been
used
and
in
--
particularly
in
the
vera
institute
project
that
has
just
been
started
in
new
york.
the
people
who
are
given
the
opportunity
of
treatment
as
contrasted
with
the
old
process
of
arrest
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
this
being
completely
voluntary,
and
in
fact
there's
not
--
they
aren't
even
allowed
to
be
brought
in
by
the
police
in
the
vera
institute
project.
under
those
circumstances,
i
don't
think
they've
had
anybody
or
any
significant
number
maybe
2
or
3%
that
have
refused
to
come
in
voluntarily
and
wanted
to
stay
there
as
long
they
would
be
allowed.
and
the
main
reason
they've
never
been
treated
before.
these
people
are
under
fringes
of
society.
they've
never
been
allowed
to
enjoy
any
of
the
health
benefits
that
the
rest
of
the
population
have.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
it
has
passed
the
house.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is,
yes,
there
is
a
citation
to
it
and
to
the
hearings
held
on
the
house
side.
the
senate
hearings
have
not
yet
been
held.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
undertake
the
responsibility
for
this
treatment.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
certainly
not,
and
i
think
the
brief
for
the
amici
points
out
in
some
veil
of
detail
that
we
don't
have
the
facilities
today.
we
don't
have
all
the
treatment
personnel
today.
we
don't
have
all
the
plans.
the
reason
is
that
communities
have
never
been
awaken
to
the
problem
and
that
we
have
found
that
with
the
court
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
up
to
now,
the
communities
have
been
awaken.
there
has
been
a
growing
consciousness
of
the
problem.
you
might
liken
it
to
the
situation
after
this
court
decided
brown
versus
board
of
education.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
pardon
sir?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
and
the
thing
that
is
i
think
disturbed
the
amici
is
that
in
most
jurisdictions
where
there
has
been
no
court
decision,
there
has
been
no
progress.
there
has
been
a
complete
unwillingness
to
deal
with
the
situation
because
it
is
being
handled
in
the
jails.
it
is
being
handled
inadequately
and
inhumanely,
but
nevertheless
you
sweep
it
under
the
rock.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
your
honor
i'd
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well
i
would
be
happy
to
deal
with
that
right
at
this
point.
the
basic
argument
is
that
the
punishment
under
the
criminal
law
of
an
inherent
universal
and
necessary
symptom
of
an
illness,
in
this
case
the
illness
being
alcoholism
and
the
symptom
being
public
intoxication
is
unconstitutional
through,
i
might
say
an
extension
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
robinson
versus
california.
we
believe
that
a
statute
which
does
not
purport
to
offer
treatment
that
will
rehabilitate
people
that
will
prevent
the
type
of
recidivism
that
is
so
clearly
shown
in
this
case
by
appellant
powell,
has
no
logic,
has
no
humanity
and
is
manifestly
cruel.
now
there
is,
in
a
sense,
there's
no
authority
that
we
can
cite
beyond
the
case
in
this
court
of
robinson
versus
california.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
entirely
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no
your
honor.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
the
punishment
is
the
conviction.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
in
our
opinion
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
this
case,
powell,
had
been
given
two
years
in
jail,
which
happened
in
driver
or
have
a
suspended
sentence
which
happened
in
easter.
it
makes
no
difference
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
what
we
say
is
that
the
criminal
law
is
inappropriate,
ineffective
and
inhumane
as
a
result.
this
is
the
very
strong
feeling
not
just
of
the
appellant
and
his
counsel,
but
of
the
law
enforcement
and
the
medical
treatment
personnel
represented
on
the
brief
for
the
amici
curiae.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
oh!
in
other
words,
you're
going
back
to
the
original
cause?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
a
state
could
make
a
legislative
determination
and
that
it
might
be
reviewable
in
court
and
it
might
be
sufficient
and
in
my
view
probably
would
be
sufficient
evidence
medically
to
overturn.
that
issue
isn't
in
this
case
because
the
texas
state
legislature
has
specifically
found
as
a
legislative
fact
that
alcoholism
is
an
illness
and
that
an
alcoholic
drinks
involuntarily.
he
has
lost
self
control
over
the
use
of
alcohol.
that
is
true
in
at
least
40
states.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
amici
curiae
in
this
case
is
the
north
american
association
of
alcoholism
programs,
which
represents
all
of
the
state
tax
supported
agencies
that
have
been
set
up
by
the
state
legislatures
to
deal
with
this
problem
under
state
statutes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
are
typical
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
are
i
would
say
somewhat
similar
to
the
texas
statute.
they
define
an
alcoholic.
they
say
that
an
alcoholic
should
be
given
treatment
and
that
alcoholism
is
an
illness.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
at
least.
there're
maybe
closer
to
--
i
say
at
least
40
because
it
may
be
45,
maybe
even
close
to
the
50.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
because
each
one
will
have
implemented
or
funded
it
to
a
different
degree,
but
certainly
i
would
say
that
none
has
done
an
adequate
job.
i
think
i
can
say
that
flatly,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
one
of
those
programs
would
disagree
with
me.
they
have
not
been
able
to
generate
the
interest
again,
because
the
problem
has
been
hidden,
and
if
i
could
say
just
a
few
concluding
words
to
save
time
for
rebuttal.
the
amici
in
this
case
who
i
say
have
the
responsibility
under
state
laws
both
for
law
enforcement
and
for
treatment
of
ill
persons,
believe
very
strongly
that
the
future
of
alcoholism
treatment
rest
in
this
case.
and
we
certainly
urge
that
this
case
--
that
in
this
case
that
the
court
keep
the
door
open
for
the
opportunity
for
treatment
that
we
wish
to
have.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
a
chronic
alcoholic
is
defined
under
the
texas
state
statute
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor,
as
a
person
who
has
lost
self-control
over
the
use
of
alcoholism.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
i
would
also
cite,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
in
appendix
b
in
our
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
certainly
not.
a
person
--
the
--
if
i
can
perhaps
define
the
laws
of
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
one
sentence
definition
from
a
recent
report.
this
i
think
is
the
best
definition
in
lay
terminology.
it
is
from
the
1967
report
to
the
nation
of
a
special
study
group
that
had
studied
the
problem
for
five
years
under
a
grant
from
the
national
institute
of
mental
health.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
on
page
39
is
a
definition
though
which
is
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
therefore
would
like
to
read
it.
alcoholism
is
defined
as
a
condition
in
which
the
individual
has
lost
control
over
his
alcohol
intake
in
the
sense
that
he
is
consistently
unable
to
refrain
from
drinking
or
to
stop
drinking
before
getting
intoxicated.
he
can't
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
or
to
stop
drinking
before
getting
intoxicated.
now
obviously
if
he
has
no
money
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
there
is
but
it's
both.
he
can't
either
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
then
quite
clearly,
he
is
not
the
man
we're
talking
about.
if,
in
my
view,
and
i
think
in
the
prevailing
medical
view
that
man
would
not
be
a
chronic
alcoholic,
unless
he
both
is
unable
to
avoid
drinking
and
unable
to
stop
once
started
then
that
man
is
not
a
chronic
alcoholic,
he
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
he
isn't
an
alcoholic
your
honor,
he
is
--
what
we
would
call
a
voluntary
drinker.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
right.
and
as
dr.wade
testified
in
the
case
below
and
as
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
appellant
knew
he
was
drinking
in
the
same
way,
i
guess
that
a
person
who
involuntarily
confesses
as
the
last
case
before
this
court
shows.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
he
knew
--
he
knows
he's
confessing
but
he's
powerless
to
avoid
it
and
the
alcoholic
is
powerless
to
avoid
either
drinking
or
he
is
powerless
--
and
he
is
powerless
to
avoid
stopping.
i'm
sorry,
he
is
powerless
to
stop
drinking.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
there
are
many
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
the
difficulty
is
this,
that
there
are
many
different
definitions
in
a
sense
for
many
different
purposes.
some
people
would
say
that
an
alcoholic
is
a
person
who
drinks
to
an
extent
that
he
--
it
has
harmed
his
life.
that
is
perhaps
the
broadest
definition
and
it
is
functional
in
some
situations
where
you
want
to
defraud
--
i'm
sorry,
define
alcoholism
broadly
for
purposes
of
getting
treatment
to
his
larger
population
as
possible.
this
would
include
the
incipient
alcoholic,
but
the
true
chronic
addictive
alcoholic
is
the
one
we're
talking
about.
and
the
chronic
alcoholic
as
opposed
to
the
incipient
alcoholic
would
have
to
have,
in
certainly
our
case,
the
appellant's
case
and
the
amici
agree,
is
based
upon
an
inability
to
abstain
and
an
inability
to
stop.
it
is
a
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
says
loss
of
self
control.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
an
un-equated
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
and
that
stands
from
a
1947
district
of
columbia
statute,
which
frankly
was
enacted
before
as
much
as
is
now
know
was
known.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is
un-equated.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
and
in
all
the
court
decisions
that
have
come
down
on
the
question
of
alcoholism,
your
honor,
the
courts
have
been
careful
to
point
out
that
they
were
talking
about
the
first
part
of
that
definition
because
that
part
of
that
the
definition
was
in
the
d.c.
case.
it
was
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
and
it's
been
in
all
of
the
cases.frankly,
it's
just
been
ignored
by
the
courts
as
un-equated.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
that's
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
like
to
defer
to
mr.
tom
davis,
a
member
of
this
bar
and
of
the
state
of
texas
bar
to
move
the
admission
as
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
nine
amici
curiae
who
are
filed
the
browns
colored
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
pose
one
qualification,
your
honor.
there
have
been
times
where
a
given
individual
was
arrested
as
the
u.s.
crime
commission
found
on
one
occasion,
some
31
times
in
four
months
largely
by
the
same
police
officer.
i
think
there
may
arise
on
occasion
where
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
arresting
officer's
discretion
where
he
obviously
has
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
would
necessarily
be
to
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
because
he
is
a
known
chronic
alcoholic,
for
example,
a
man
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
that
incident
took
place
who
had
been
adjudicated
by
court
to
be
a
chronic
alcoholic
and
had
been
acquitted
on
31
prior
occasions.
the
--
i
think
at
that
point
the
arresting
officer
if
he
knows
that
would
--
well
he
may
have
not
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
but
certainly
if
he
did
not
know
that
the
man
was
an
alcoholic,
i
would
agree
100%.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
as
i
say
your
honor,
i
am
not
an
authority
under
law
of
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
i
have
not
researched
that
in
detail.
i
merely
raised
that
as
one
possibility
that
certainly
the
u.s.
crime
commission
did
raise
a
question
about
it.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
did
not
discuss
it
in
constitutional
terms.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
certainly
do,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i'm
a
little
bit
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
am
troubled
by
your
analysis
a
little
bit,
and
i'd
like
to
use
the
analogy
to
the
insane.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
this
day
and
age
to
convict
an
insane
person
for
a
product
caused
by
his
insanity.
i
would
not
suggest
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
arrest
him
and
charge
him
with
a
crime.
therefore,
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
the
chief
justice
in
that
analysis.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
because
you
have
questions.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
--private
agencies
and
trained
or
professional
personnel
as
well
as
lay
persons.
they're
deeply
interested,
all
of
them,
in
improving
both
law
enforcement
and
the
standard
of
healthcare
in
our
society.
the
chief
justice
raised
the
question
just
before
we
adjourned,
about
the
lack
of
facilities
to
handle
the
public
inebriate
alcoholic
in
our
population.
i
can't
speak
specifically
for
the
state
of
the
argue
in
texas,
but
certainly
around
the
country,
the
amici
represent
the
people
who
would
have
to
take
up
the
slack
and
who
must
provide
that
treatment.
the
american
medical
association,
the
state
programs
in
alcoholism.
these
are
the
people
who
will
be
dealing
with
the
problem.
they're
prepared
to
undertake
the
treatment.
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
found
throughout
the
country
is
that
in
areas
where
the
jails
have
hidden
the
problem
up
to
now,
the
situation
is
very
poor.
there
is
a
lack
of
treatment,
but
as
soon
as
the
jails
are
not
used
to
hide
the
problem,
treatment
becomes
available
largely
to
a
better
use
of
existing
resources.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
we
think
it
unnecessary
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well
i
think
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
think
there
is
a
tenable
position
that
has
been
urged
to
the
court
in
the
brief
on
that
very
point.
we
think
it
unnecessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
we
think
this
presents
a
very
simple
case
of
an
illness.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
think
this
raises
a
very
important
question
of
what
this
means
to
a
community
with
a
ruling
that
is
handed
down,
for
example
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
philadelphia
and
atlanta,
georgia
and
in
the
fourth
circuit.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
court
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
holding
that
alcoholism
is
a
defense
to
the
charge
of
public
intoxication.
the
police
and
the
health
authorities
have
devised
plans
that
are
beginning
to
circumvent
the
arrest
process
completely.
we
now
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
as
to
any
person.
and
the
--
what
will
happen
is
that
these
people
as
recommended
by
the
u.s.
and
d.c.
crime
commissions
will
be
all
be
taken
directly
to
a
detoxification
center.
there
is
a
bill
in
congress
now
that
has
passed
the
house
of
representatives
that
repeals
the
district
of
columbia
public
intoxication
law.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
we
are
not
arguing
that
point
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
the
entire
issue
in
this
point,
in
this
case,
but
i
did
want
to
answer
the
question
that
was
posed.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
tremendous
reform,
and
frankly
those
are
the
reforms
that
the
amici
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
not
completely,
no.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
--
well
let
me
suggest
that
in
1960
--
fiscal
year
1966,
there
were
47,000
arrests
for
public
intoxication,
and
that
had
remained
steady
for
about
five
years.
in
fiscal
'67,
i
have
the
preliminary
figures
which
show
37,000
that's
a
decrease
--
of
10,000
arrests.
i
would
suggest,
and
that
was
before
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
do
not.
atlanta
was
notorious
as
being
worst
than
the
district
of
columbia
in
terms
of
arrest
and
i
have
no
information
on
that
area
or
philadelphia.
but
philadelphia,
the
diagnostic
and
relocation
center
has
submitted
both
a
brief
to
this
court
which
i
believe
is
a
yellow
colored
brief,
and
also
a
report
of
a
10-day
study
entitled
alternatives
to
arrest,
which
points
out
that
what
the
way
they
obviously
would
head
under
their
decision
would
be
to
circumvent
the
entire
arrest
problem.
i
would
like
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
at
the
present
time
your
honor?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
the
authority
and
at
this
at
one
time
was
debated
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
whether
there
was
a
common
law
authority
to
pick
up
an
incapacitated
drunk
on
the
street
and
take
him
to
a
health
--
to
a
hospital.
in
the
d.c.
crime
commission
report,
the
commissioner's
unanimously
concluded
that
there
was
common
law
authority
to
do
this
under
the
--
as
a
civil
law
matter
and
that
it
would
not
constitute
a
criminal
arrest.
they
used
the
example
of
taking
an
insane
person
or
a
heart
attack
victim
to
a
hospital.
nevertheless,
they
went
on
to
say
that
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
this
and
if
the
police
were
concerned,
certainly
the
police
should
be
protected
by
a
statute.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
right.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
say
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
think,
the
way
i
would
analyze
it
and
this
is
my
personal
view
point,
is
that
the
state
is
justified
in
intervening
in
a
parens
patriae
view
or
rather
role
anytime
that
the
individual
is
incapacitated
for
any
reason,
whether
it's
drunkenness
and
whether
he's
an
alcoholic
or
not.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
but
that
once
he
becomes
in
a
position
where
he
is,
you
might
say
sufficiently
in
possession
of
its
faculties
to
make
a
rational
decision
which
has
to
be
a
medical
judgment
that
he
should
be
allowed
either
to
leave
or
to
stay.
now
i
think
it's
interesting
that
in
the
places
where
detoxification
had
been
used
and
in
--
particularly
in
the
vera
institute
project
that
has
just
been
started
in
new
york.
the
people
who
are
given
the
opportunity
of
treatment
as
contrasted
with
the
old
process
of
arrest
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
this
being
completely
voluntary,
and
in
fact
there's
not
--
they
aren't
even
allowed
to
be
brought
in
by
the
police
in
the
vera
institute
project.
under
those
circumstances,
i
don't
think
they've
had
anybody
or
any
significant
number
maybe
2
or
3%
that
have
refused
to
come
in
voluntarily
and
wanted
to
stay
there
as
long
they
would
be
allowed.
and
the
main
reason
they've
never
been
treated
before.
these
people
are
under
fringes
of
society.
they've
never
been
allowed
to
enjoy
any
of
the
health
benefits
that
the
rest
of
the
population
have.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
it
has
passed
the
house.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is,
yes,
there
is
a
citation
to
it
and
to
the
hearings
held
on
the
house
side.
the
senate
hearings
have
not
yet
been
held.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
undertake
the
responsibility
for
this
treatment.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
certainly
not,
and
i
think
the
brief
for
the
amici
points
out
in
some
veil
of
detail
that
we
don't
have
the
facilities
today.
we
don't
have
all
the
treatment
personnel
today.
we
don't
have
all
the
plans.
the
reason
is
that
communities
have
never
been
awaken
to
the
problem
and
that
we
have
found
that
with
the
court
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
up
to
now,
the
communities
have
been
awaken.
there
has
been
a
growing
consciousness
of
the
problem.
you
might
liken
it
to
the
situation
after
this
court
decided
brown
versus
board
of
education.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
pardon
sir?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
and
the
thing
that
is
i
think
disturbed
the
amici
is
that
in
most
jurisdictions
where
there
has
been
no
court
decision,
there
has
been
no
progress.
there
has
been
a
complete
unwillingness
to
deal
with
the
situation
because
it
is
being
handled
in
the
jails.
it
is
being
handled
inadequately
and
inhumanely,
but
nevertheless
you
sweep
it
under
the
rock.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
your
honor
i'd
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well
i
would
be
happy
to
deal
with
that
right
at
this
point.
the
basic
argument
is
that
the
punishment
under
the
criminal
law
of
an
inherent
universal
and
necessary
symptom
of
an
illness,
in
this
case
the
illness
being
alcoholism
and
the
symptom
being
public
intoxication
is
unconstitutional
through,
i
might
say
an
extension
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
robinson
versus
california.
we
believe
that
a
statute
which
does
not
purport
to
offer
treatment
that
will
rehabilitate
people
that
will
prevent
the
type
of
recidivism
that
is
so
clearly
shown
in
this
case
by
appellant
powell,
has
no
logic,
has
no
humanity
and
is
manifestly
cruel.
now
there
is,
in
a
sense,
there's
no
authority
that
we
can
cite
beyond
the
case
in
this
court
of
robinson
versus
california.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
entirely
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no
your
honor.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
the
punishment
is
the
conviction.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
in
our
opinion
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
this
case,
powell,
had
been
given
two
years
in
jail,
which
happened
in
driver
or
have
a
suspended
sentence
which
happened
in
easter.
it
makes
no
difference
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
what
we
say
is
that
the
criminal
law
is
inappropriate,
ineffective
and
inhumane
as
a
result.
this
is
the
very
strong
feeling
not
just
of
the
appellant
and
his
counsel,
but
of
the
law
enforcement
and
the
medical
treatment
personnel
represented
on
the
brief
for
the
amici
curiae.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
oh!
in
other
words,
you're
going
back
to
the
original
cause?
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
a
state
could
make
a
legislative
determination
and
that
it
might
be
reviewable
in
court
and
it
might
be
sufficient
and
in
my
view
probably
would
be
sufficient
evidence
medically
to
overturn.
that
issue
isn't
in
this
case
because
the
texas
state
legislature
has
specifically
found
as
a
legislative
fact
that
alcoholism
is
an
illness
and
that
an
alcoholic
drinks
involuntarily.
he
has
lost
self
control
over
the
use
of
alcohol.
that
is
true
in
at
least
40
states.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
amici
curiae
in
this
case
is
the
north
american
association
of
alcoholism
programs,
which
represents
all
of
the
state
tax
supported
agencies
that
have
been
set
up
by
the
state
legislatures
to
deal
with
this
problem
under
state
statutes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
are
typical
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
they
are
i
would
say
somewhat
similar
to
the
texas
statute.
they
define
an
alcoholic.
they
say
that
an
alcoholic
should
be
given
treatment
and
that
alcoholism
is
an
illness.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
at
least.
there're
maybe
closer
to
--
i
say
at
least
40
because
it
may
be
45,
maybe
even
close
to
the
50.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
because
each
one
will
have
implemented
or
funded
it
to
a
different
degree,
but
certainly
i
would
say
that
none
has
done
an
adequate
job.
i
think
i
can
say
that
flatly,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
one
of
those
programs
would
disagree
with
me.
they
have
not
been
able
to
generate
the
interest
again,
because
the
problem
has
been
hidden,
and
if
i
could
say
just
a
few
concluding
words
to
save
time
for
rebuttal.
the
amici
in
this
case
who
i
say
have
the
responsibility
under
state
laws
both
for
law
enforcement
and
for
treatment
of
ill
persons,
believe
very
strongly
that
the
future
of
alcoholism
treatment
rest
in
this
case.
and
we
certainly
urge
that
this
case
--
that
in
this
case
that
the
court
keep
the
door
open
for
the
opportunity
for
treatment
that
we
wish
to
have.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
a
chronic
alcoholic
is
defined
under
the
texas
state
statute
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor,
as
a
person
who
has
lost
self-control
over
the
use
of
alcoholism.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
i
would
also
cite,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
in
appendix
b
in
our
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
certainly
not.
a
person
--
the
--
if
i
can
perhaps
define
the
laws
of
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
no,
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
one
sentence
definition
from
a
recent
report.
this
i
think
is
the
best
definition
in
lay
terminology.
it
is
from
the
1967
report
to
the
nation
of
a
special
study
group
that
had
studied
the
problem
for
five
years
under
a
grant
from
the
national
institute
of
mental
health.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
on
page
39
is
a
definition
though
which
is
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
therefore
would
like
to
read
it.
alcoholism
is
defined
as
a
condition
in
which
the
individual
has
lost
control
over
his
alcohol
intake
in
the
sense
that
he
is
consistently
unable
to
refrain
from
drinking
or
to
stop
drinking
before
getting
intoxicated.
he
can't
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
or
to
stop
drinking
before
getting
intoxicated.
now
obviously
if
he
has
no
money
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
there
is
but
it's
both.
he
can't
either
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
then
quite
clearly,
he
is
not
the
man
we're
talking
about.
if,
in
my
view,
and
i
think
in
the
prevailing
medical
view
that
man
would
not
be
a
chronic
alcoholic,
unless
he
both
is
unable
to
avoid
drinking
and
unable
to
stop
once
started
then
that
man
is
not
a
chronic
alcoholic,
he
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
he
isn't
an
alcoholic
your
honor,
he
is
--
what
we
would
call
a
voluntary
drinker.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that's
right.
and
as
dr.wade
testified
in
the
case
below
and
as
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
appellant
knew
he
was
drinking
in
the
same
way,
i
guess
that
a
person
who
involuntarily
confesses
as
the
last
case
before
this
court
shows.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
he
knew
--
he
knows
he's
confessing
but
he's
powerless
to
avoid
it
and
the
alcoholic
is
powerless
to
avoid
either
drinking
or
he
is
powerless
--
and
he
is
powerless
to
avoid
stopping.
i'm
sorry,
he
is
powerless
to
stop
drinking.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
there
are
many
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
well,
the
difficulty
is
this,
that
there
are
many
different
definitions
in
a
sense
for
many
different
purposes.
some
people
would
say
that
an
alcoholic
is
a
person
who
drinks
to
an
extent
that
he
--
it
has
harmed
his
life.
that
is
perhaps
the
broadest
definition
and
it
is
functional
in
some
situations
where
you
want
to
defraud
--
i'm
sorry,
define
alcoholism
broadly
for
purposes
of
getting
treatment
to
his
larger
population
as
possible.
this
would
include
the
incipient
alcoholic,
but
the
true
chronic
addictive
alcoholic
is
the
one
we're
talking
about.
and
the
chronic
alcoholic
as
opposed
to
the
incipient
alcoholic
would
have
to
have,
in
certainly
our
case,
the
appellant's
case
and
the
amici
agree,
is
based
upon
an
inability
to
abstain
and
an
inability
to
stop.
it
is
a
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
says
loss
of
self
control.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
an
un-equated
--
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes,
and
that
stands
from
a
1947
district
of
columbia
statute,
which
frankly
was
enacted
before
as
much
as
is
now
know
was
known.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
it
is
un-equated.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
that
is
correct.
and
in
all
the
court
decisions
that
have
come
down
on
the
question
of
alcoholism,
your
honor,
the
courts
have
been
careful
to
point
out
that
they
were
talking
about
the
first
part
of
that
definition
because
that
part
of
that
the
definition
was
in
the
d.c.
case.
it
was
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
and
it's
been
in
all
of
the
cases.frankly,
it's
just
been
ignored
by
the
courts
as
un-equated.
mr.
peter
barton
hutt
yes
that's
--
