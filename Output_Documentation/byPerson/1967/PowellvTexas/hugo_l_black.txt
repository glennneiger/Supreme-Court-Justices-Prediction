may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
to
see
if
i
understand.
then
i
understand
what
you
have
said
that
a
man
who
is
a
chronic
alcoholic
can
not
be
constitutionally
convicted
of
a
crime.
that's
basically
what
you're
presenting
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
--
yes
for
the
crime
of
public
intoxication.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
can
not
constitutionally
be
convicted,
but
if
the
policeman
comes
along
and
sees
the
man,
you
--
it
seems
to
me
it
gotten
awfully
considerably,
duty
of
arrest.
if
a
policeman
comes
along
and
sees
a
man
that
it's
completely
insane,
no
doubt
he's
crazy,
and
he
sees
him
shooting
somebody
on
the
street,
he
would
sudden
if
you
justified
an
arrest
if
he
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
defense
would
be
later
set
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
policeman
would
be
absolutely
justified
in
making
the
arrest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
understand
it
that's
what
you've
been
trying
to
argue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
theory
seems
