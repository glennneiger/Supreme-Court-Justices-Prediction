justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
as
i
read
frothingham,
i
would
say
that
it's
based
squarely
upon
separation
of
powers
that
for
the
courts
to
entertain
a
stockholder
to
pay
a
taxpayer's
action
of
this
sort
would
be
to
invade
the
legislative
prerogatives
of
the
congress
for
example
and
that
the
court
certainly
talked
in
terms
of
one
of
jurisdiction,
an
absence
of
jurisdiction.
and
that
the
very
last
sentence
in
the
opinion
which
i
have
before
me
says
that
to
entertain
the
suit,
would
be
not
to
decide
a
judicial
controversy,
but
to
assume
a
position
of
authority
over
the
governmental
acts
of
another
and
co-equal
department
and
authority
which
plainly
we
do
not
possess,
which
reads
to
me
as
the
court
is
saying
two
things.
one,
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
two,
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
of
the
principles
of
separation
of
powers.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
followed
your
argument
on
that
but
you
did
not,
you
haven't
heretofore
addressed
yourself
to
this
question
of
the
separation
of
powers,
which
as
i
read
the
opinion
in
frothingham
is
the
basis
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
frothingham
says
there
are
certain
types
of
actions
including
that
the
exercise
of
the
appropriation
of
power
and
the
determination
of
how
federal
moneys
which
will
be
expended
which
are
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
therefore,
as
i
read
frothingham
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
i'm
asking
for
your
help,
as
i
read
frothingham
where
the
court
said,
“and
therefore,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
on
this
type
of
suit.”
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you're
right
about
that
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
mr.
justice
sutherland
used
some
language
kind
of
loosely
when
he
said,
that
by
jurisdiction
that
we
do
not
possess,
and
said
that
we
have
a
want
of
jurisdiction
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
position
in
frothingham
is
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
that
the
suit
was
properly
brought
by
a
taxpayer
that
the
court
might
have
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
maternity
act
and
that
it's
merely
declined
to
do
so
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
or
something
of
the
sort,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
--
would
you
make
any
distinction
between
or
among
the
types
of
cases
that
taxpayers
may
bring,
that
is
may
a
taxpayer
--
would
a
taxpayer
have
standing
to
attack
for
example,
the
constitutionality
of
appropriations
for
welfare
funds
or
the
constitutionality
of
expenditures
for
farm
subsidies
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
this
discretion
business?
you
mean
to
say
that
we
can
decide
that
we
will
or
will
not
entertain
suits
without
any
later
hindrance,
there
being
no
alternative
forum?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
a
matter
of
complete
discretion
in
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
not
talking
about
this
court,
the
federal,
we're
talking
about
the
federal
courts.
now,
can
they
--
can
the
district
courts
although
the
proposition
is
established
that
a
taxpayer
has
standing
to
challenge
any
sort
of
expenditure
of
federal
funds.
if
that
proposition
were
established,
could
a
district
court
say,
we'll
enter,
you
have
standing
to
attack
this
kind,
but
not
the
other
kind
and
on
what
basis
would
you
draw
such
a
line?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
i'm
raising
questions
of
what
is
the
discretion?
whether
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
court
or
whether
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
to
maintain
the
suit
and
therefore
the
district
court
has
a
duty
to
entertain
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
apart
from
sound
discretion,
is
it
your
submission
that
a
taxpayer
has
standing
to
challenge
the
appropriation
and
expenditure
of
federal
funds
where
that
challenge
is
based
upon
alleged
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
not
otherwise.
is
that
your
submission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
i'm
afraid
that
doesn't
help
me
very
much.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
draw
--
you
make
no
distinction,
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
there
is
jurisdiction
that
taxpayer's
standing
to
challenge
any
federal
appropriation
and
that
means
that
this
--
that
the
congress
passes
a
law,
authorizing
certain
expenditures
for
let's
say,
farm
subsidy
or
welfare
program
and
that
means
that
a
taxpayer
can
go
into
a
district
court.
and
the
district
court
if
it
is
so
minded
would
have
a
--
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
and
if
it's
so
minded,
it
could
for
example
issue
a
restraining
order
and
temporary
injunction
pendente
lite,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
that
really
help
you,
mr.
solicitor
general?
does
that
help
you
because
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
your
point
up
to
705
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
alleges
as
i
understand
it
not
that
funds
are
being
expended
for
religious
instruction,
but
they
are
being
expended
for
instruction
in
religious
schools
and
that
is
unconstitutional.
the
complaint
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
think
that's
really
surely
clear
that
they
mean
something
a
little
different
from,
what
i
understand
you
to
imply,
what
they're
saying
is
they're
attacking
the
actions
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
approving
the
plan
of
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
have
thought
we
had
enough
trouble
with
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
the
complaint
or
your
point.
as
i
understand
it
what
they
are
in
effect
asking
for
is
an
injunction
against
the
secretary
of
hew
and
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
united
states
to
prevent
them
from
approving
a
program
of
the
department
of
education
of
new
york,
to
the
extent
that
that
program
provides
for
the
payment
of
money
to
religious
schools
for
these
--
for
the
purposes
that
are
clearly
stated
in
here.
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that
the
complaint
has
failed
to
state
a
justiciable
cause.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
grounds
that
you're
now
urging.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
different
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
that's
not
the
argument
you
are
addressing.
justice
abe
fortas
but
another
part
of
argument
is
that
if
it
should
have
been
dismissed
on
that
ground,
it
should
have
been
dismissed
by
a
motion
in
the
district
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
government
should
stop.
what
i
am
suggesting
that
if
you're
right
about
that,
it's
--
i'm
suggesting
that
may
be
if
the
government
moved
below
on
this
ground
that
there
is
a
substantial
ground,
it’s
at
least
unfortunate.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that's
true
of
all
taxpayer
suits?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
i
did
misunderstand
you
then.
what
you're
saying,
what
you're
doing
then
is
not
attacking
this
complaint
especially
but
saying
that
all
taxpayer
suits
are
by
their
nature,
by
their
nature
present
abstract
questions.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
you
rather
that
we
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
it
was

that
judge
frankel
was
the
only
judge
vested
in
jurisdiction.[laughter]
