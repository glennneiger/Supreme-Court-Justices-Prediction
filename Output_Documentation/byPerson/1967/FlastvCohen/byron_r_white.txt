absolutely,
we're
talking
about
equity
jurisdiction?
justice

white
were
you
--
did
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
the
government's
position
would
mean
that
there
was
absolutely
no
one
to
do
that,
there
are
other
kinds
of
parties
i
suppose,
but
the
government
you
think
would
object
to
them
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
state
or
what
about
the
state
or
the
authority
within
a
state,
if
the
plan
they
submitted
was
not
approved
by
the
secretary
on
the
grounds
that
it
didn't
comply
with
the
act
in
that
benefits
were
not
allocated
to
a
certain
private
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
they
are
the
ones
who
originated
the
plan,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
doesn't
require
them
to
present
a
plan
which
involves
this
particular
kind
of
money
expenditure?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
local
administrator
wanted
to
submit
a
plan
without
these
disbursements
and
i
suppose
he
could
and
if
it
were
turned
down,
he
might
have
legitimate
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
massachusetts
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
--
senator
what
do
you
with
the
doremus
and
that
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
mr.
jackson
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
it
would've
been
different
if
there's
just
been
actually
expenditures
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
reading
of
doremus?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
involve
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
money
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
that
be
the
–
if
what
you
say
is
the
proper
construction
of
the
complaint
there
is
really
nothing
stated
against
these
defendants.
do
you
think
that
it
comes
out
to
a
jurisdictional
question
of
standing
or
shouldn't
it
be
just
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
failure
to
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that,
i
agree
with
that.
i
certainly
would
agree
with
that
but
the
argument
doesn't
state
the
facts
against
these
sentences
of
standing
problem,
but
it
is
just
a
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
