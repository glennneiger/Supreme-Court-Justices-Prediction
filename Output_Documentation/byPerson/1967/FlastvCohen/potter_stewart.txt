justice
potter
stewart
wilson
against
shaw
of
course
was
that
--
was
before
frothingham
and
i
suppose
the
government
counsel
says
that
frothingham
simply
overruled
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
suggest
a
variety
of
possible
ways?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
i
read
in
the
briefs
somewhere
that
there
is
pending
litigation
in
the
state
courts
attacking
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
reference
to
the
caption
and
file
of
that
case
and
then
where
it
is,
i
suppose
that's
a
matter
of
the
court's
judicial
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
suggested,
i
think
here
that
long
ago
that
an
attack
might
have
been
made
upon
that
act
upon
first
amendment
ground
if
as
you
suspect
or
suppose
some
of
the
money
was
used
in
presbyterian
or
methodist
or
roman
catholic
or
jewish
hospitals,
was
that
--
that
was
the
point
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
have
suggested?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fact
is
that
there
was
no
attack
in
that
case
upon
the
legislation
upon
the
grounds
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
attack
there
was
based
on
the
tenth
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
mrs.
--
does
the
frothingham
party
was
based
on
what
constitutional
provision?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
now
passed
again
at
frothingham
and
i
find
it
--
you're
quite
right.
the
attack
of
the
appellant
frothingham
in
that
case
was
based
not
only
on
the
tenth
amendment,
but
also
that
the
taking
of
her
checks
would
violate
the
due
--
take
her
property
without
due
process
of
law,
but
it
was
as
we
both
agree
not
based
upon
in
anyway
upon
the
first
amendment.
it
occurs
to
me
that
whatever
the
validity
or
rational
of
the
frothingham
decision
may
be
and
there
has
been
some
difference
of
opinion
about
that
expressed
here
today,
that
as
suggested
by
in
oral
argument
here,
particularly
by
senator
ervin
and
as
suggested
by
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
frankel
in
this
district
court
that
might
even
accepting
frothingham
that
there
might
and
should
be
quite
a
different
rule
with
respect
at
least
to
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
because
what
the
establishment
clause
itself
prohibits
among
other
explicit
things,
but
most
explicitly
prohibits
is
the
expenditure
of
public
taxpayers
money
for
religious
purposes
whereas
the
tenth
amendment
doesn't
have
very
much
to
do
with
the
expenditure
of
federal
money
nor
does
the
due
process
clause
have
very
much
to
do
with
the
expenditure
of
federal
money.
the
establishment
clause
at
least
of
the
first
amendment
has
directly
and
explicitly
to
do
with
that
very
subject
and
that's
the
difference
between
this
case
and
frothingham.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it
does
have
to
do
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart

by

it's

you've

another

you

didn't
quite

your
last
