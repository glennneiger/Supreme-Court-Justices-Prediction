mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
charge
in
this
suit
is
that
two
high
officers
of
the
federal
government
have
acted
improperly.
it's
irrelevant,
but
i
think
it
highlights
the
abstract
nature
of
the
case
to
point
out
that
the
first
of
the
defendants
is
no
longer
in
office.
i
don't
know
what's
the
name
of
the
case
is
now.
it
isn't
flast
against
gardner.
the
essence
of
the
charge
is
that
these
officers
have
misapplied
an
act
of
congress
or
more
accurately
that
they
have
allowed
others,
state
school
officials
to
make
such
a
misapplication.
as
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
raised
first
the
question
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
or
putting
it
in
another
way,
whether
this
was
a
case
which
was
required
by
any
act
of
congress
to
be
heard
by
a
district
court
of
three
judges.
in
examining
this
question,
i
will
ask
the
court
to
look
in
three
places.
first,
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court;
second,
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
and
third,
the
arguments
made
here
by
the
appellants.
the
complaint
begins
on
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix
which
from
the
course
of
habit,
i
suspect
i
will
call
the
record.
it's
carefully
drawn
by
skilled
lawyers
and
i
would
suppose
it
could
be
taken
at
face
value.
incidentally,
it
makes
no
allegation
whatever
that
the
plaintiffs'
tax
liabilities
have
been
increased
by
a
reason
of
anything
that
has
been
done.
let
me
call
attention
first
on
page
6a
of
the
record
to
paragraphs
8
and
9
where
it
is
alleged
under
the
heading,
factual
allegations
higher
on
the
page,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
title
i,
section
205
(a)
(2)
to
require
local
educational
agencies
in
order
to
qualify
for
federal
funds
to
violate
the
prohibitions
of
the
first
amendment.
in
other
words,
they
are
contending
that
the
statute
properly
construed,
does
not
provide
for
any
violation.
and
then
in
paragraph
9,
there
is
a
very
interesting
allegation,
“there
are
many
programs
within
the
meaning
of
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
which
could
practicably
be
instituted
by
local
educational
agencies
which
would
qualify
them
for
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
under
the
act,
but
which
would
not
violate
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.”
in
other
words,
the
act,
the
alleged
is
constitutional.
and
then
finally
on
paragraph
11,
“on
inspiration
and
belief,
it
is
feasible
and
practicable
for
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york
to,”
it
says
expand,
i
assume
it
means,
expend
this
--
to
--
no,
it
is
expand,
“to
expand
this
constitutional
programs
and
institute
other
constitutional
programs
and
thereby
qualify
for
and
receive
all
the
federal
funds
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
act.
then
the
complaint
goes
on
to
a
heading
on
page
9
under
causes
of
action
and
there
are
two
causes
of
action,
paragraph
16,
first
count.
“the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
violate
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
that
they,”
now
that's
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
which
is
the
question
of
construing
the
statute,
not
that
the
statute
is
invalid,
“constitute
a
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.”
and
summarily
in
the
paragraph
17
of
the
second
count,
“the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants,”
again
it
is
the
construction
made
by
the
defendants
which
is
charged
not
the
statute
itself
and
finally,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
payers
for
relief,
paragraph
21,
the
last
full
line,
they
referred,
they
asked
the
court
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants.
on
the
page
10,
the
complaint
does
move
a
little
further.
it
starts
out
to
say
that
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
and
then
almost
as
an
afterthought
and
with
no
factual
allegation
to
support
it,
they
ask
in
the
alternative
if
such
determination
and
action
are
within
the
authority
and
in
the
intent
of
the
act,
the
act
is
to
that
extent
unconstitutional
and
void
and
that
phrase
is
the
only
thing
in
the
complaint
which
either
asserts
or
presents
any
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
alleged
that
it
has
been.
they
make
--
that
is
a
completely
allegation.
it
makes
no
reference
to
any
particular
place,
any
particular
school.
no
way
to
tell
what
are
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
observe
that
that
does
tie
in
with
the
argument
about
unconstitutionality.
but
let
me
refer
next
to
the
statute
itself.
much
of
it
though
not
all
of
it,
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellants'
brief
beginning
on
page
57.
it's
a
long
statute
and
obviously
very
carefully
drawn.
this
is
the
blue
covered
brief.
it's
obviously
an
educational
and
welfare
act
by
which
congress
sought
as
it
stated
in
the
opening
declaration
of
policy
to
recognize
the
special
educational
needs
of
children
of
low
income
families.
and
the
fact
that
special
problems
are
created
because
such
children
tend
to
be
concentrated
in
certain
areas
and
the
desire
of
congress
to
assist
local
educational
agencies
with
concentrations
of
children
from
low
income
families
to
expand
and
improve
their
programs
in
order
to
contribute
particularly
to
meeting
the
specially
--
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children.
the
statute
then
contains
provision
for
grants
to
the
states
either
directly
or
though
local
education
or
agencies.
the
applications
of
the
local
educational
agencies
must
be
approved
by
the
appropriate
state,
educational
agency
and
this
approval
requires
a
determination
of
several
factors,
and
that
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
material
in
section
205
on
page
63
of
the
appellant's
brief.
205
(a)
(1)
that
payments
under
this
title
will
be
used
for
programs
and
projects
which
are
designed
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
school
attendance
areas
having
high
concentration
of
children
from
low
income
families.
and
then
i
would
call
attention
to
the
--
of
the
court
to
the
provisions
for
judicial
review
which
appear
on
page
69
and
then
to
title
ii
which
relates
to
library
resources
where
congress
directs
the
commissioner
to
carry
out
a
program
for
making
grants
for
the
acquisition
of
school
library
resources,
textbooks
and
other
printed
and
published
instructional
materials
for
the
use
of
children
and
teachers
in
public
and
private
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
on
page
74
in
section
203
(a)
(3)
(b),
the
states
are
required
to
provide
assurance
that
to
the
extent
consistent
with
law
such
library
and
textbook
facilities
will
be
provided
on
an
equitable
basis.
and
there
are
provisions
on
page
75
in
the
same
section
which
require
that
the
expenditures
shall
in
no
case
supplant
state,
local
and
private
school
funds.
and
finally
on
page
76
in
section
205,
it
is
expressly
provided
that
title
to
library
resources,
textbooks
and
other
printed
and
published
instructional
materials
furnished
pursuant
to
this
title
and
control
and
administration
of
their
use
shall
vest
only
in
a
public
agency.
and
then
finally
again
on
page
77,
there
is
provision
for
judicial
review
and
there
is
also
provision
in
section
206
that
the
commissioner
shall
watch
and
see
that
there
is
no
change
in
the
plan
which
has
been
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
contend,
there's
one
more
section
of
the
statute
that
helps
in
this
contention
that
the
statute
is
perfectly,
plainly
constitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
trying
to
contend
at
this
point
in
my
argument,
mr.
justice,
that
their
contention
is
directed
not
against
the
statute,
but
against
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
if
it
is
against
the
administration
of
the
statute,
it
was
not
a
case
which
called
for
a
three-judge
court
and
therefore
does
not
lie
within
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
this
point,
i
am
discussing
simply
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
do
want
to
refer
to
what
i
will
now
call
section
805
of
the
act,
and
i
think
i
should
explain
this
because
the
court
may
in
looking
and
checking
on
this
may
find
some
problem.
this
was
first
enacted
in
1965
as
section
605
and
then
in
1966,
the
act
was
amended
and
this
was
changed
to
section
705.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
summarized
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
last
part
of
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
4
contains
practically
all
of
it,
but
i'll
read
the
full
text
of
section
705
which
is
three-and-a-half
lines
long.
“nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
authorize
the
making
of
any
payment
under
this
act
or
under
any
act
amended
by
this
act
for
religious
worship
or
instruction.”
that
is
section
--
now
section
805.
now,
finally,
let
me
turn
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
helps
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
complaint
here
and
all
of
the
contentions
are
against
the
administration
of
the
act
and
not
against
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
enough
of
an
allegation
without
any
factual
basis
to
support
it,
to
support
the
contention
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
now,
let
us
turn
to
the
brief
which
was
filed
by
the
appellees,
by
the
appellants
in
this
court.
this
reinforces
the
position
taken
in
their
pleading.
it
makes
it
plain
that
they
are
talking
about
administration
and
not
about
the
basic
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
indeed,
at
page
4
of
the
brief
as
already
been
pointed
out,
the
appellant
expressly
states,
first
two
lines
of
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page,
“the
plaintiffs
do
not
count
the
constitutionality
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.”
they
then
quote
paragraph
9
of
their
complaint
to
which
i've
already
referred
in
which
they
assert
that
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
statute
can
be
administered
constitutionally.
now,
let
me
also
point
out
two
other
items
on
page
4
of
their
brief.
one
of
the
contentions
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
which
is
relevant
here
is
that
in
this
suit
as
taxpayers
they
are
federal
taxpayers
and
if
they
have
standing
to
question
things
in
new
york,
they
have
as
much
standing
to
question
was
being
done
in
california,
hawaii,
and
i
guess
guam
as
what
happens
in
new
york
and
they
tried
to
cut
that
down
in
the
district
court
and
the
statement
at
the
top
of
page
4
that
the
plaintiffs
through
their
attorney
expressly
stated
that
this
case
was
to
be
deemed
one
limited
to
the
practices
of
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
not
what
the
federal
officer
join
but
the
new
york
city
board
of
education.
and
the
last
line
and
a
half
of
the
following
paragraph,
“to
defend
only
the
programs
and
practices
engaged
within
the
city
of
new
york.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
so,
but
let's
take
a
look
at
page
17
of
their
brief.
just
above
the
middle
of
the
page
about
10
lines
down
on
page
17,
they
say
the
complaint
in
the
present
suit
should
not
have
been
dismissed
for
it
too
should
have
been
deemed
a
suit
against
the
municipality.
now
the
only
municipality
would
be
that
of
the
city
of
new
york.
a
similar
statement
is
made
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
where
we
are
told
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
case
even
if
it
be
deemed
a
suit
against
the
federal
government
rather
than
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york.
i'm
not
here
representing
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york,
but
the
appellants
seem
to
regard
this
as
a
suit
against
those
officers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
there
is
pending
a
case
there
and
that
seems
to
me
they
go
to
what
you
might
call
equity
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
that
is
the
case
where
the
defendants
against
whom
they
do
have
a
charge
are
in
court
and
where
this
matter
might
be
decided
and
it's
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
high
federal
officers
should
come
in
here
to
defend
a
matter
which
turns
largely
on
actions
done
by
state
administrative
officers.
finally
on
pages
52
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i'm
not
--
it's
in
a
footnote,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
turn
to
it
at
once.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
copy
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
may
be,
i'm
not
--
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
contending
that
it
does
materially
affect
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
thing
that
is
before
the
court
is
this
complaint
and
i
am
suggesting
that
a
complaint
which
does
not
in
effect
allege
any
facts
with
respect
to
the
defendants
in
the
complaint
does
not
present
the
issue
which
the
parties
seek
to
present
here.
let
met
finally
call
attention
to
pages
52
and
53
of
the
appellees'
brief
where
twice
they
say
that
what
they
are
contending
against
is
the
administration
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
have
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
mr.
justice
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
court
had
found
probable
jurisdiction.
so
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
raise
the
question
in
our
brief.
it
is
our
duty
to
raise
jurisdictional
questions
whenever
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
will
get
to
that
in
the
next
portion
of
my
argument.
but
to
conclude
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
many
cases
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
three-judge
court
with
attendant
direct
appeal
when
and
i'm
quoting,
“when
administrative
action
and
not
the
act
of
congress
is
the
sale.”
here
the
appellants
expressly
disclaim
any
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
as
this
court
said
in
the
ex
parte
bransford
where
the
complaint
seeks
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
result
obtained
by
the
use
of
a
statute
which
does
not
attack
this
unconstitutional,
no
special
court
is
required
where
the
attack
is
aimed
at
an
allegedly
erroneous
administrative
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
it
first
became
apparent
to
us
when
we
read
the
appellants'
brief
and
found
that
striking
statement
at
the
beginning
that
no
charge
is
made
against
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
standard
fall
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
on
the
pleadings
and
that
led
us
to
reexamine
the
pleadings
and
when
we
re-examined
the
pleadings
we
found
repeated
allegations
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
act
and
only
incidental,
but
seemed
to
us
afterthought
allegations
relating
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
now
turn
to
the
other
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case.
it
might
be
known
as
frothingham
revisited
where
the
setting
here
is
extraordinarily
close
to
that
which
was
actually
involved
in
the
frothingham
case.
among
other
things
that
was
a
welfare
statute.
the
maternity
act
of
1921,
it
called
for
payments
to
be
made
to
state
child
welfare
or
hygiene
agencies.
the
states
were
required
to
present
detailed
plans
for
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
for
approval
of
a
newly
created
board
of
maternity
and
infant
hygiene
composed
of
the
chief
of
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
labor,
the
surgeon
general
and
the
commissioner
of
education,
the
same
officer
who
is
involved
here.
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
carry
out
some
research
and
find
out
whether
some
of
the
money
actually
expended
under
the
maternity
act
of
1921
was
used
in
presbyterian
or
jewish
hospitals,
but
i
think
is
very
likely
that
it
was.
in
the
frothingham
case,
this
court
held
that
a
taxpayer
could
not
maintain
a
suit
to
enjoin
an
expenditure
under
that
act.
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
--
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
possible
to
make
such
an
attack.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
was
merely
trying
to
point
out
that
cases
are
extraordinarily
parallel.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
attack
made
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
was
based
on
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
quite
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
due
process
perhaps,
taking
of
her
money
without
proper
constitutional
warrant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
he
relied
in
part
on
the
tenth
amendment,
but
not
sue
it.
i
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
the
result
that
was
reached
in
the
frothingham
case
was
a
fortunate
one.
the
case
has
served
us
well.
it's
not
operated
to
shield
great
illegality
on
the
part
of
either
the
federal
government
or
the
states.
with
the
frothingham
on
the
books,
this
court
has
had
ample
room
to
move
around
to
fulfill
its
function
and
our
constitutional
and
federal
system.
if
the
rule
had
not
been
so
long
established,
it
would
still
be
a
good
one.
there
is
no
occasion,
we
contend,
to
overturn
a
doctrine
which
has
functioned
well
and
has
stood
the
test
of
time.
one
of
the
first
cases
that
came
before
this
court
was
hayburn's
case
in
2
dallas
in
1792.
there
the
court
made
up
of
judges
who
were
familiar
with
the
framing
of
the
constitution
declined
to
decide
a
friendly
suit
designed
to
get
an
opinion
on
a
legal
question
with
which
government
officers
were
confronted.
during
the
same
decade,
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
not
give
an
advisory
opinion
at
the
request
of
president
washington.
affirming
him
against
mellon
was,
i
submit,
simply
a
modern
exemplar
of
the
doctrine
so
clearly
stated
in
the
early
days
of
the
court.
it
has
been
explained
in
various
ways
as
a
matter
of
case
or
controversy,
as
a
matter
standing,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
denial
or
judicial
self-limitation,
as
something
akin
to
the
rule
of
the
court
will
not
decide
political
questions
and
so
on.
i
think
it
partakes
of
all
of
these
things
and
that
they
are
ways
of
expressing
an
important
element
that
lies
back
of
the
decision
without
in
any
way
losing
any
benefit
that
those
ideas
provide.
i
would
suggest
that
the
frothingham
decision
and
its
predecessors
and
successors
are
in
last
analysis,
expressions
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
which
is
embedded
in
our
history
and
as
substantially
affected
constitutional
doctrine.
in
the
field
of
intergovernmental
immunities,
for
example,
the
mcculloch
and
maryland,
and
collector
against
dave,
well,
the
latter
case
has
been
overruled.
it's
still
the
law
i
suppose
that
a
discriminatory
state
tax
against
a
federal
officer
would
be
unconstitutional.
there's
no
provision
in
the
constitution
which
says
so,
but
the
constitution
does
establish
the
federal
system
and
the
constitutional
doctrine
flows
from
that
fact.
now,
similarly,
the
constitution
sets
up
the
three
co-equal
branches
of
our
government
and
this
is
the
basis
for
constitutional
rules
and
practices.
only
two
weeks
ago,
we
had
in
this
area
an
example
of
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
case
involving
a
congressman
adam
clayton
powell.
of
course
this
court
has
not
passed
on
that
decision,
but
it
is
relevant
since
the
result
reached
for
the
court
of
appeals
turns
essentially
on
concepts
of
separation
of
powers.
under
that
doctrine
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
get
all
the
help
that
i
can.
[laughter]
under
that
doctrine,
the
matter
of
the
capacity,
the
whole
seat
in
congress
is
one
for
the
houses
of
that
body
to
decide
and
it
is
not
fitting
for
a
court
says
the
court
of
appeals,
a
part
of
another
co-equal
branch
of
the
government
to
enter
into
it.
do
i
mean
by
this
that
it's
never
appropriate
for
a
court
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
since
that
would
inevitably
bring
the
court
into
conflict
with
the
legislative
body
which
has
of
course
given
its
own
opinion
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
enacting
it?
obviously
enough
i
make
no
such
contention.
i
do
say
though
that
considerations
arising
out
of
the
separation
of
powers
make
it
appropriate
and
i
would
say
impair
that
the
court
considered
heavily
the
circumstances
under
which
it
will
undertake
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
now,
that
i
suggest
was
what
the
court
was
doing
in
frothingham
against
mellon.
the
considerations
that
led
the
court
to
withhold
its
hand
there
are
equally
valid
today.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
justice,
i
kind
of
like
to
qualify
you
explicitly
there
there
because
of
course
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
modern
view
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
perfectly
plain
that
it
was
not
conception
of
the
first
amendment
when
it
was
written
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
at
all
i
like
it.
my
brother
was
the
treasurer
of
a
congregational
church
in
exeter,
new
hampshire
and
he,
on
behalf
of
the
finance
committee,
wanted
to
borrow
money
on
a
mortgage
in
order
to
put
an
elevator
in
the
church
and
they
discovered
that
the
title
to
the
church
is
in
the
town
of
exeter.
and
they
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
giving
the
title
out
of
the
town
of
exeter
because
constitutional
objections
were
made
that
this
would
be
an
appropriation
for
a
religious
body
and
i
simply
mentioned
this
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
first
amendment
says
there
shall
be
no
appropriation
for
an
establishment
of
religion.
the
first
amendment
does
prohibit
an
establishment
of
religion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
that
what
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion
is
a
complex
and
difficult
matter.
for
example,
we
have
always
had
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
always
had
and
still
have
in
this
country
and
i
hope
we
will
retain
tax
exemption
for
religious
bodies
and
that
is
certainly
a
substantial
financial
aid
to
a
religion
which
until
very
recently
was
never
questioned
in
any
way
and
i
simply
suggest
that
this
is
a
far
more
complex
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
welcome
a
chance
to
get
that
as
the
thread
of
my
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
and
frankly,
i
do
not
myself
place
much
stock
as
a
citizen
and
lawyer
in
the
preferred
status
of
the
first
amendment
i
like
all
of
the
constitution.
i
like
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
prohibition
against
titles
and
mobility
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
hard
to
say
and
hard
to
find
any
historical
or
other
basis
for
saying
that
because
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
it
should
be
treated
in
a
different
way.
this
court’s
great
moments
come
when
it
deals
with
people,
people
who
are
directly
affected
by
government
or
the
law.
i
think
of
frank
against
magnum
and
the
scottsboro
boys
and
shuffling
sam.
the
court
did
not
do
so
well
with
dred
scott,
largely
because
it
lost
sight
of
scott
and
used
his
case
as
a
vehicle
for
seeking
to
dispose
of
a
large
question
which
was
then
rending
the
country
and
which
need
not
have
been
decided
in
order
to
dispose
of
his
case.
when
the
court
has
considered
broad
and
general
questions
in
the
abstract
more
or
less,
it
has
not
always
found
the
results
lastingly
valid.
the
decision
holding
in
new
york
workman's
compensation
act
unconstitutional
might
be
cited
as
an
example
and
if
i
may
say
so
with
great
respect
to
your
honor's
predecessors,
the
decision
which
might
have
been
rendered
if
frothingham
v.
mellon
had
gone
the
other
way.
the
genius
of
the
common
law
and
in
large
measure,
the
talisman
of
constitutional
adjudication
is
the
concrete
case
with
real
and
specific
facts.
we
common
lawyers
do
not
do
so
well
in
the
abstract.
the
present
litigation
is
utterly
abstract.
there
are
no
real
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
is
entirely
in
general
terms.
it
could
be
applicable
to
over
22,000
local
projects
which
had
been
financed
by
the
office
of
education
under
this
statute
all
over
the
country
in
every
state
with
many
types
of
projects
and
almost
limitless
local
variations.
it
is
true
that
in
this
court,
the
appellant
say
that
they
limit
their
complaint
to
practices
in
new
york
city.
even
as
to
that
though,
no
facts
whatever
are
alleged.
everything
is
in
general
terms.
the
appellants
do
not
like
what
is
being
done
under
the
act,
but
was
is
being
done
has
left
to
speculation.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
i
suggest
that
some
things
are
being
done
in
the
sectarian
or
parochial
schools
because
even
the
appellants
concede
that
medical
and
dental
services
may
be
provided
in
sectarian
schools.
i
suppose
this
would
apply
to
psychiatric
services,
remedial
programs
for
retarded
or
disturbed
children
are
not
much
different
and
the
record
in
the
court
below
included
in
an
assertion
that
such
children
will
be
better
reached
if
instruction
is
given
to
them
in
their
own
familiar
surroundings,
but
we
have
no
facts
about
such
matters,
not
because
the
court
below
cut
off
proof
but
because
they
were
never
alleged.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
what
school
and
on
what
page
mr.
justice
is
something
alleged
to
have
been
done?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
read
it
mr.
justice.
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say
mr.
justice
that
they
do
not
allege
tax
which
say
that
at
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time,
something
can
be
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
is
that
issues
of
this
sort
ought
to
be
decided
in
specific
concrete
cases
and
not
in
perfectly
general
terms
and
why
we're
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
i
would
like
to
add
some
facts
upon
which
this
case
in
stand.
now,
why
our
facts
not
alleged?
because
i
submit
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
this
is
all
what
--
this
all
bears
on
standing
to
sue.
they
would
have
standing
if
they
have
alleged
a
specific
concrete
case
and
facts
which
showed
that
they
were
hurt
by
something.
the
reason
that
they
didn't
allege
facts
it
seems
to
me
is
what
they
are
seeking
here
is
a
broad
general
declaration
of
the
statutes
or
about
the
administration
of
the
statute
of
theoretical
determination
divorced
from
any
concrete
impact
on
any
party
in
the
case.
that's
why
i
think
it's
relevant
to
this
point.
some
citizens,
who
happen
to
be
taxpayers
too,
though
i
don't
think
that's
important,
do
not
like
what
the
government
is
doing.
though
as
near
as
i
can
tell,
the
things
they
don't
like
are
being
done
by
officials
of
new
york
state
and
city
governments
and
so
they
sue
two
high
officers
of
the
government
for
what?
for
a
declaration
and
injunction
that
the
very
general
things
they
assert
without
ever
putting
down
the
single
concrete
fact
are
unauthorized
or
unconstitutional.
now,
this
i
submit
is
essentially
a
prayer
for
an
advisory
opinion,
an
opinion
which
is
to
be
rendered
in
broad,
general,
and
essentially
abstract
terms.
let
me
see
if
i
can
test
that
statement.
suppose
this
case
came
here
the
other
way
around.
let
me
suppose
that
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
were
doubtful
and
uncertain
about
their
powers
and
responsibilities
under
the
act.
of
course
they
could
ask
their
general
counsel
or
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
could
request
the
attorney
general
to
give
an
opinion,
but
such
opinions
would
be
advisory
only.
they
would
not
bind
anyone
outside
the
government,
but
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
wanted
a
decision.
so
they
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
asking
for
a
binding
declaration.
against
whom
do
they
file
the
suit?
well,
that's
a
nice
question.
they've
heard
that
mr.
pfeffer
and
know
that
he
has
long
given
thoughtful
consideration
to
these
matters
so
they
named
him
as
the
defendant
and
then
there’s
mr.
brownell,
he
knows
his
way
around
the
government
and
they
name
him
as
the
defendant.
it
really
doesn't
matter
who
they
named
since
no
one
has
any
direct
personal
interest
in
the
question
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
since
all
points
of
view
will
be
presented
as
briefs
filed
by
friends
of
the
court.
in
the
abstract
though,
let
me
observe
and
in
the
absence
of
any
concrete
facts.
i
might
point
out
that
we
have
a
full
court
of
amicus
briefs
here
and
when
i
counted
them
last,
there
were
nine
and
i've
lost
six
to
three.
can
it
be
imagined
for
a
moment
that
the
suit
by
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
would
be
entertained
by
any
court.
i
don't
think
so
and
why
not,
because
it
would
be
seeking
an
essentially
advisory
opinion,
a
decision
in
the
case
which
does
not
really
have
adverse
parties
and
which
did
not
arise
on
specific
concrete
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
mr.
justice
they
do
not
--
they
do
not
allege
a
single
program.
they
do
not
allege
a
single
fact,
a
single
school,
a
single
specific
situation
where
anything
is
done
and
if
something
is
being
done
in
the
sectarian
school
has
become
quite
relevant
to
know
what
is
being
done
and
what
are
the
circumstances
of
that
and
none
of
those
facts
are
alleged
in
anyway.
everything
here
is
in
completely
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
still
think
we
would
have
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
taxpayers
suits
on
the
one
hand
in
that
they
would
not
be
affected
by
what
was
done
in
their
--
either
in
their
pecuniary
or
in
their
personal
interest.
i
also
think
we
have
a
real
problem
here
in
that
commissioner
gardner
--
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
have
no
direct
supervisory
or
administrative
responsibility
here
and
indeed
a
section
of
the
statute
not
quoted
in
our
brief
expressly
prevents
them
from
undertaking
to
operate
the
programs
of
the
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
plans
which
states
that
something
will
be
unconstitutional
or
illegal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
don't
know
what
the
plans
are.
i
agree.
they
are
not
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
assuming
that
there
were
allegations
which
raise
it
and
that
there
were
--
this
was
the
type
of
case
in
view
of
the
essentially
abstract
nature
of
the
claim
that
is
made
which
is
proper
for
the
courts
to
decide
under
what
i
would
call
a
fair
application
of
well
established
principles
of
separation
of
powers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
i'm
not
because
here
the
absence
of
a
concrete
case
is
what
keeps
this
from
being
a
suit
to
use
madison's
raised
of
a
judiciary
nature.
it
is
of
course
proper
for
this
court
to
pass
--
to
consider
and
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
when
that
issue
is
presented
to
it
in
an
actual
controversy
involving
specific
facts,
i
suggest
that
in
this
case,
what
is
sought
is
a
simply
general
abstract
declaration
and
that
frothingham
against
mellon
is
a
great
exemplar
of
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
against
powers
that
this
court
will
not
enter
into
such
an
undertaking.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
maybe
--
may
be
a
part
of
the
trouble.
people
are
talking
in
general
terms.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
the
charge
related
to
specific
facts
and
if
it
were
brought
by
people
who
were
hurt
by
what
has
been
done
of
course
the
court
ought
to
consider
and
decide
the
case.
in
the
hypothetical
suit
that
i
referred
to
brought
by
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
and
it's
an
obviously
impossible
suit,
the
issues
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
the
interest
of
the
parties
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
those
sought
to
be
raised
here.
the
defendants
would
be
taxpayers
and
citizens
as
the
appellants
are
here.
the
fact
is
that
it
would
make
it
unwise
and
inappropriate
to
decide
that
case
are
equally
applicable
here.
they
are
the
factors
which
lay
behind
this
court’s
decision
in
the
frothingham
case
and
they
remain
equally
valid
today.
few
days
ago,
we
celebrated
the
127th
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
justice
holmes.
in
1904,
shortly
after
he
came
on
this
court,
he
wrote
the
court's
opinion
in
missouri,
kansas
and
texas
railway
company
against
may,
in
which
he
said
“great
constitutional
provisions
must
be
administered
with
caution.
some
play
must
be
allowed
for
the
joints
of
the
machine
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
legislatures
are
ultimate
guardians
of
the
liberty
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
and
quite
as
great
the
degree
as
the
courts.”
this
is
a
case
i
submit
where
it's
appropriate
in
the
proper
application
of
the
constitutionally
established
separation
or
divisions
of
powers
in
this
country
for
this
court
to
refrain
from
rendering
a
decision
until
a
case
of
a
truly
judiciary
nature
arises
and
is
properly
presented
to
the
court.
not
an
abstract
general
case
seeking
a
sweeping
declaration
about
everybody's
rights,
but
a
case
raising
a
specific
question
by
someone
who
was
hurt.
that
will
present
a
proper
case
for
a
judicial
action.
this
is
a
peculiarly
a
situation
where
there
should
be
room
for
play
in
the
joints.
the
questions
involved
here
are
not
ones
of
black
and
white.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
this
is
a
problem
filled
with
so
many
uncertainties,
mr.
justice,
so
many
variables,
so
many
problems
and
difficulties,
it
is
not
wise
and
fitting
it
seems
to
me
for
the
court
to
enter
into
it
in
a
general
and
abstract
way.
but
it
is
wise
for
the
court
to
wait
until
its
rule
is
called
for,
that
of
deciding
a
case
between
parties
of
where
the
people
have
themselves
a
genuine
personal
interest
in
the
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
the
court
has
a
case
like
that
on
its
docket
now
which
will
be
heard
either
later
this
term
or
early
next
term,
the
case
involving
a
city
in
new
york
which
came
up
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i've
already
pointed
out
to
two
provisions
in
this
statute
itself
containing
provision
for
judicial
review
and
that
if
a
plan
was
disapproved
by
the
secretary
or
the
commissioner
on
these
grounds,
the
state
school
authorities
could
directly
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
to
get
the
question
raised.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
question
can
be
raised
and
in
which
if
it
is
raised
it
will
be
raised
in
a
specific
concrete
context.
here
the
appellants
have
conceded
that
medical
and
dental
services
may
be
rendered
to
children
in
sectarian
schools.
they
agree
that
inspection
may
be
given
in
the
public
schools
to
children
from
the
sectarian
schools
and
that
library
services
could
be
given
to
all
children
on
publicly
owned
neutral
ground.
their
complaint
is
against
remedial
and
guidance
services
note
not
some
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
exactly
what
the
issue
will
be
there,
but
i
do
know
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
passed
on
them
it
is
the
basis
of
the
appeal
from
that
decision
which
is
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
moved
to
dismiss
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
had
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
do
not
have
standing
to
maintain
this
act
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
for
such
other
and
further
relief,
is
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
appreciate
it
mr.
justice
but
if
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed
on
any
ground
i
believe
that
that's
appropriate
to
raise
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
understand
that
i'm
making
a
separate
ground.
i'm
trying
to
make
an
argument
in
terms
of
frothingham
against
mellon
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
which
ought
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
would
be
true
of
the
taxpayer
suits
and
the
federal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
that
is
exemplified
in
a
rather
striking
way
by
this
particular
complaint.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
and
president
are
as
much
want
to
uphold
the
constitution
as
are
the
courts
or
government
lawyers.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
was
long
before
congress,
thoroughly
debated
there,
carefully
drawn
with
the
precise
issue
here
presented
well
in
line
and
finally
resolved
by
the
action
of
congress
and
the
approval
of
the
president.
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
problem
before
congress
involved
not
merely
the
question
of
church
and
state,
but
also
another
great
constitutional
principle,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
provided
as
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
perhaps
made
applicable
to
the
united
states
by
the
fifth
amendment.
this
court
now
has
before
its
certain
welfare
cases
where
it
is
contended
that
if
welfare
is
to
be
given
by
a
state,
it
must
be
made
available
on
a
basis
of
equality
to
all
persons
with
similar
needs
without
the
irrelevant
or
arbitrary
qualifications.
summarily,
congress
could
well
have
concluded
that
if
aid
was
to
be
given
to
needy
children,
or
if
books
were
to
be
provided
for
children
in
school,
these
things
should
be
available
to
all
children
and
that
anything
else
would
be
an
inadmissible
denial
of
equal
protection.
all
that
i
say
now
is
that
these
questions
are
real
ones.
they
are
difficult
ones.
they
were
wrestled
out
by
congress
in
a
way
that
it's
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
admiration
as
well
as
respect.
in
due
course,
this
court
will
have
to
come
to
its
own
conclusion
and
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
the
action
of
congress
or
the
president
though
they
were
aware
of
their
constitutional
duties
is
binding
on
this
court.
but
it
is
entitled
to
respect
and
in
this
situation
to
weight.
this
is,
i
submit
one
of
the
places
where
there
is
some
small
room
for
freedom
in
the
joints
in
our
great
constitutional
structure.
this
court
will
of
course
not
shrink
its
judicial
duty
when
a
truly
concrete
cases
presented
by
someone
who
is
hurt
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
application
of
the
statute.
until
such
a
case
is
presented,
proper
deference
to
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
government,
proper
regard
to
the
great
principles
of
separation
of
powers
requires,
i
submit,
that
the
court
withhold
its
hand.
a
great
predecessor
of
mine
john
w.
davis,
when
president
of
the
american
bar
association
referred
in
his
presidential
address
to
this
court's
power
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
and
the
criticisms
which
had
been
made
of
the
use
of
that
power
and
the
certain
proposals
to
curb
it.
in
discussing
this
matter,
he
said,
there
is
a
curious
misconception
underlying
much
that
is
said
and
written
on
this
subject
as
to
the
duties
that
the
court
is
called
upon
the
discharge.
one
might
suppose
from
some
of
these
outgivings
that
the
court
sat
at
the
outer
gate
of
congress
waiting
to
visit
the
zealous
censorship
on
the
laws
that
issue
from
that
port
and
that
over
then
it
had
a
general
power
of
life
and
death
or
of
approval
or
of
veto.
but
all
thus,
as
are
the
functions
of
the
court,
surely
they
do
not
go
one
step
beyond
the
administration
of
justice
to
individual
litigants.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
charge
in
this
suit
is
that
two
high
officers
of
the
federal
government
have
acted
improperly.
it's
irrelevant,
but
i
think
it
highlights
the
abstract
nature
of
the
case
to
point
out
that
the
first
of
the
defendants
is
no
longer
in
office.
i
don't
know
what's
the
name
of
the
case
is
now.
it
isn't
flast
against
gardner.
the
essence
of
the
charge
is
that
these
officers
have
misapplied
an
act
of
congress
or
more
accurately
that
they
have
allowed
others,
state
school
officials
to
make
such
a
misapplication.
as
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
raised
first
the
question
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
or
putting
it
in
another
way,
whether
this
was
a
case
which
was
required
by
any
act
of
congress
to
be
heard
by
a
district
court
of
three
judges.
in
examining
this
question,
i
will
ask
the
court
to
look
in
three
places.
first,
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court;
second,
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
and
third,
the
arguments
made
here
by
the
appellants.
the
complaint
begins
on
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix
which
from
the
course
of
habit,
i
suspect
i
will
call
the
record.
it's
carefully
drawn
by
skilled
lawyers
and
i
would
suppose
it
could
be
taken
at
face
value.
incidentally,
it
makes
no
allegation
whatever
that
the
plaintiffs'
tax
liabilities
have
been
increased
by
a
reason
of
anything
that
has
been
done.
let
me
call
attention
first
on
page
6a
of
the
record
to
paragraphs
8
and
9
where
it
is
alleged
under
the
heading,
factual
allegations
higher
on
the
page,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
title
i,
section
205
(a)
(2)
to
require
local
educational
agencies
in
order
to
qualify
for
federal
funds
to
violate
the
prohibitions
of
the
first
amendment.
in
other
words,
they
are
contending
that
the
statute
properly
construed,
does
not
provide
for
any
violation.
and
then
in
paragraph
9,
there
is
a
very
interesting
allegation,
“there
are
many
programs
within
the
meaning
of
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
which
could
practicably
be
instituted
by
local
educational
agencies
which
would
qualify
them
for
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
under
the
act,
but
which
would
not
violate
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.”
in
other
words,
the
act,
the
alleged
is
constitutional.
and
then
finally
on
paragraph
11,
“on
inspiration
and
belief,
it
is
feasible
and
practicable
for
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york
to,”
it
says
expand,
i
assume
it
means,
expend
this
--
to
--
no,
it
is
expand,
“to
expand
this
constitutional
programs
and
institute
other
constitutional
programs
and
thereby
qualify
for
and
receive
all
the
federal
funds
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
act.
then
the
complaint
goes
on
to
a
heading
on
page
9
under
causes
of
action
and
there
are
two
causes
of
action,
paragraph
16,
first
count.
“the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
violate
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
that
they,”
now
that's
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
which
is
the
question
of
construing
the
statute,
not
that
the
statute
is
invalid,
“constitute
a
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.”
and
summarily
in
the
paragraph
17
of
the
second
count,
“the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants,”
again
it
is
the
construction
made
by
the
defendants
which
is
charged
not
the
statute
itself
and
finally,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
payers
for
relief,
paragraph
21,
the
last
full
line,
they
referred,
they
asked
the
court
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants.
on
the
page
10,
the
complaint
does
move
a
little
further.
it
starts
out
to
say
that
the
determination
and
action
of
the
defendants
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
and
then
almost
as
an
afterthought
and
with
no
factual
allegation
to
support
it,
they
ask
in
the
alternative
if
such
determination
and
action
are
within
the
authority
and
in
the
intent
of
the
act,
the
act
is
to
that
extent
unconstitutional
and
void
and
that
phrase
is
the
only
thing
in
the
complaint
which
either
asserts
or
presents
any
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
alleged
that
it
has
been.
they
make
--
that
is
a
completely
allegation.
it
makes
no
reference
to
any
particular
place,
any
particular
school.
no
way
to
tell
what
are
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
observe
that
that
does
tie
in
with
the
argument
about
unconstitutionality.
but
let
me
refer
next
to
the
statute
itself.
much
of
it
though
not
all
of
it,
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellants'
brief
beginning
on
page
57.
it's
a
long
statute
and
obviously
very
carefully
drawn.
this
is
the
blue
covered
brief.
it's
obviously
an
educational
and
welfare
act
by
which
congress
sought
as
it
stated
in
the
opening
declaration
of
policy
to
recognize
the
special
educational
needs
of
children
of
low
income
families.
and
the
fact
that
special
problems
are
created
because
such
children
tend
to
be
concentrated
in
certain
areas
and
the
desire
of
congress
to
assist
local
educational
agencies
with
concentrations
of
children
from
low
income
families
to
expand
and
improve
their
programs
in
order
to
contribute
particularly
to
meeting
the
specially
--
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children.
the
statute
then
contains
provision
for
grants
to
the
states
either
directly
or
though
local
education
or
agencies.
the
applications
of
the
local
educational
agencies
must
be
approved
by
the
appropriate
state,
educational
agency
and
this
approval
requires
a
determination
of
several
factors,
and
that
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
material
in
section
205
on
page
63
of
the
appellant's
brief.
205
(a)
(1)
that
payments
under
this
title
will
be
used
for
programs
and
projects
which
are
designed
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
school
attendance
areas
having
high
concentration
of
children
from
low
income
families.
and
then
i
would
call
attention
to
the
--
of
the
court
to
the
provisions
for
judicial
review
which
appear
on
page
69
and
then
to
title
ii
which
relates
to
library
resources
where
congress
directs
the
commissioner
to
carry
out
a
program
for
making
grants
for
the
acquisition
of
school
library
resources,
textbooks
and
other
printed
and
published
instructional
materials
for
the
use
of
children
and
teachers
in
public
and
private
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
on
page
74
in
section
203
(a)
(3)
(b),
the
states
are
required
to
provide
assurance
that
to
the
extent
consistent
with
law
such
library
and
textbook
facilities
will
be
provided
on
an
equitable
basis.
and
there
are
provisions
on
page
75
in
the
same
section
which
require
that
the
expenditures
shall
in
no
case
supplant
state,
local
and
private
school
funds.
and
finally
on
page
76
in
section
205,
it
is
expressly
provided
that
title
to
library
resources,
textbooks
and
other
printed
and
published
instructional
materials
furnished
pursuant
to
this
title
and
control
and
administration
of
their
use
shall
vest
only
in
a
public
agency.
and
then
finally
again
on
page
77,
there
is
provision
for
judicial
review
and
there
is
also
provision
in
section
206
that
the
commissioner
shall
watch
and
see
that
there
is
no
change
in
the
plan
which
has
been
provided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
contend,
there's
one
more
section
of
the
statute
that
helps
in
this
contention
that
the
statute
is
perfectly,
plainly
constitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
trying
to
contend
at
this
point
in
my
argument,
mr.
justice,
that
their
contention
is
directed
not
against
the
statute,
but
against
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
if
it
is
against
the
administration
of
the
statute,
it
was
not
a
case
which
called
for
a
three-judge
court
and
therefore
does
not
lie
within
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
this
point,
i
am
discussing
simply
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
do
want
to
refer
to
what
i
will
now
call
section
805
of
the
act,
and
i
think
i
should
explain
this
because
the
court
may
in
looking
and
checking
on
this
may
find
some
problem.
this
was
first
enacted
in
1965
as
section
605
and
then
in
1966,
the
act
was
amended
and
this
was
changed
to
section
705.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
summarized
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
last
part
of
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
4
contains
practically
all
of
it,
but
i'll
read
the
full
text
of
section
705
which
is
three-and-a-half
lines
long.
“nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
authorize
the
making
of
any
payment
under
this
act
or
under
any
act
amended
by
this
act
for
religious
worship
or
instruction.”
that
is
section
--
now
section
805.
now,
finally,
let
me
turn
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
helps
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
complaint
here
and
all
of
the
contentions
are
against
the
administration
of
the
act
and
not
against
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
enough
of
an
allegation
without
any
factual
basis
to
support
it,
to
support
the
contention
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
now,
let
us
turn
to
the
brief
which
was
filed
by
the
appellees,
by
the
appellants
in
this
court.
this
reinforces
the
position
taken
in
their
pleading.
it
makes
it
plain
that
they
are
talking
about
administration
and
not
about
the
basic
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
indeed,
at
page
4
of
the
brief
as
already
been
pointed
out,
the
appellant
expressly
states,
first
two
lines
of
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page,
“the
plaintiffs
do
not
count
the
constitutionality
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.”
they
then
quote
paragraph
9
of
their
complaint
to
which
i've
already
referred
in
which
they
assert
that
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
statute
can
be
administered
constitutionally.
now,
let
me
also
point
out
two
other
items
on
page
4
of
their
brief.
one
of
the
contentions
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
which
is
relevant
here
is
that
in
this
suit
as
taxpayers
they
are
federal
taxpayers
and
if
they
have
standing
to
question
things
in
new
york,
they
have
as
much
standing
to
question
was
being
done
in
california,
hawaii,
and
i
guess
guam
as
what
happens
in
new
york
and
they
tried
to
cut
that
down
in
the
district
court
and
the
statement
at
the
top
of
page
4
that
the
plaintiffs
through
their
attorney
expressly
stated
that
this
case
was
to
be
deemed
one
limited
to
the
practices
of
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
not
what
the
federal
officer
join
but
the
new
york
city
board
of
education.
and
the
last
line
and
a
half
of
the
following
paragraph,
“to
defend
only
the
programs
and
practices
engaged
within
the
city
of
new
york.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
so,
but
let's
take
a
look
at
page
17
of
their
brief.
just
above
the
middle
of
the
page
about
10
lines
down
on
page
17,
they
say
the
complaint
in
the
present
suit
should
not
have
been
dismissed
for
it
too
should
have
been
deemed
a
suit
against
the
municipality.
now
the
only
municipality
would
be
that
of
the
city
of
new
york.
a
similar
statement
is
made
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
where
we
are
told
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
case
even
if
it
be
deemed
a
suit
against
the
federal
government
rather
than
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york.
i'm
not
here
representing
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york,
but
the
appellants
seem
to
regard
this
as
a
suit
against
those
officers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
there
is
pending
a
case
there
and
that
seems
to
me
they
go
to
what
you
might
call
equity
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
that
is
the
case
where
the
defendants
against
whom
they
do
have
a
charge
are
in
court
and
where
this
matter
might
be
decided
and
it's
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
high
federal
officers
should
come
in
here
to
defend
a
matter
which
turns
largely
on
actions
done
by
state
administrative
officers.
finally
on
pages
52
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i'm
not
--
it's
in
a
footnote,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
turn
to
it
at
once.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
copy
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
may
be,
i'm
not
--
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
contending
that
it
does
materially
affect
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
thing
that
is
before
the
court
is
this
complaint
and
i
am
suggesting
that
a
complaint
which
does
not
in
effect
allege
any
facts
with
respect
to
the
defendants
in
the
complaint
does
not
present
the
issue
which
the
parties
seek
to
present
here.
let
met
finally
call
attention
to
pages
52
and
53
of
the
appellees'
brief
where
twice
they
say
that
what
they
are
contending
against
is
the
administration
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
have
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
mr.
justice
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
court
had
found
probable
jurisdiction.
so
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
raise
the
question
in
our
brief.
it
is
our
duty
to
raise
jurisdictional
questions
whenever
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
will
get
to
that
in
the
next
portion
of
my
argument.
but
to
conclude
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
many
cases
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
three-judge
court
with
attendant
direct
appeal
when
and
i'm
quoting,
“when
administrative
action
and
not
the
act
of
congress
is
the
sale.”
here
the
appellants
expressly
disclaim
any
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
as
this
court
said
in
the
ex
parte
bransford
where
the
complaint
seeks
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
result
obtained
by
the
use
of
a
statute
which
does
not
attack
this
unconstitutional,
no
special
court
is
required
where
the
attack
is
aimed
at
an
allegedly
erroneous
administrative
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
it
first
became
apparent
to
us
when
we
read
the
appellants'
brief
and
found
that
striking
statement
at
the
beginning
that
no
charge
is
made
against
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
standard
fall
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
on
the
pleadings
and
that
led
us
to
reexamine
the
pleadings
and
when
we
re-examined
the
pleadings
we
found
repeated
allegations
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
act
and
only
incidental,
but
seemed
to
us
afterthought
allegations
relating
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
now
turn
to
the
other
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case.
it
might
be
known
as
frothingham
revisited
where
the
setting
here
is
extraordinarily
close
to
that
which
was
actually
involved
in
the
frothingham
case.
among
other
things
that
was
a
welfare
statute.
the
maternity
act
of
1921,
it
called
for
payments
to
be
made
to
state
child
welfare
or
hygiene
agencies.
the
states
were
required
to
present
detailed
plans
for
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
for
approval
of
a
newly
created
board
of
maternity
and
infant
hygiene
composed
of
the
chief
of
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
labor,
the
surgeon
general
and
the
commissioner
of
education,
the
same
officer
who
is
involved
here.
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
carry
out
some
research
and
find
out
whether
some
of
the
money
actually
expended
under
the
maternity
act
of
1921
was
used
in
presbyterian
or
jewish
hospitals,
but
i
think
is
very
likely
that
it
was.
in
the
frothingham
case,
this
court
held
that
a
taxpayer
could
not
maintain
a
suit
to
enjoin
an
expenditure
under
that
act.
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
--
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
possible
to
make
such
an
attack.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
was
merely
trying
to
point
out
that
cases
are
extraordinarily
parallel.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
attack
made
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
was
based
on
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
quite
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
due
process
perhaps,
taking
of
her
money
without
proper
constitutional
warrant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
he
relied
in
part
on
the
tenth
amendment,
but
not
sue
it.
i
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
the
result
that
was
reached
in
the
frothingham
case
was
a
fortunate
one.
the
case
has
served
us
well.
it's
not
operated
to
shield
great
illegality
on
the
part
of
either
the
federal
government
or
the
states.
with
the
frothingham
on
the
books,
this
court
has
had
ample
room
to
move
around
to
fulfill
its
function
and
our
constitutional
and
federal
system.
if
the
rule
had
not
been
so
long
established,
it
would
still
be
a
good
one.
there
is
no
occasion,
we
contend,
to
overturn
a
doctrine
which
has
functioned
well
and
has
stood
the
test
of
time.
one
of
the
first
cases
that
came
before
this
court
was
hayburn's
case
in
2
dallas
in
1792.
there
the
court
made
up
of
judges
who
were
familiar
with
the
framing
of
the
constitution
declined
to
decide
a
friendly
suit
designed
to
get
an
opinion
on
a
legal
question
with
which
government
officers
were
confronted.
during
the
same
decade,
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
not
give
an
advisory
opinion
at
the
request
of
president
washington.
affirming
him
against
mellon
was,
i
submit,
simply
a
modern
exemplar
of
the
doctrine
so
clearly
stated
in
the
early
days
of
the
court.
it
has
been
explained
in
various
ways
as
a
matter
of
case
or
controversy,
as
a
matter
standing,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
denial
or
judicial
self-limitation,
as
something
akin
to
the
rule
of
the
court
will
not
decide
political
questions
and
so
on.
i
think
it
partakes
of
all
of
these
things
and
that
they
are
ways
of
expressing
an
important
element
that
lies
back
of
the
decision
without
in
any
way
losing
any
benefit
that
those
ideas
provide.
i
would
suggest
that
the
frothingham
decision
and
its
predecessors
and
successors
are
in
last
analysis,
expressions
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
which
is
embedded
in
our
history
and
as
substantially
affected
constitutional
doctrine.
in
the
field
of
intergovernmental
immunities,
for
example,
the
mcculloch
and
maryland,
and
collector
against
dave,
well,
the
latter
case
has
been
overruled.
it's
still
the
law
i
suppose
that
a
discriminatory
state
tax
against
a
federal
officer
would
be
unconstitutional.
there's
no
provision
in
the
constitution
which
says
so,
but
the
constitution
does
establish
the
federal
system
and
the
constitutional
doctrine
flows
from
that
fact.
now,
similarly,
the
constitution
sets
up
the
three
co-equal
branches
of
our
government
and
this
is
the
basis
for
constitutional
rules
and
practices.
only
two
weeks
ago,
we
had
in
this
area
an
example
of
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
case
involving
a
congressman
adam
clayton
powell.
of
course
this
court
has
not
passed
on
that
decision,
but
it
is
relevant
since
the
result
reached
for
the
court
of
appeals
turns
essentially
on
concepts
of
separation
of
powers.
under
that
doctrine
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
get
all
the
help
that
i
can.
[laughter]
under
that
doctrine,
the
matter
of
the
capacity,
the
whole
seat
in
congress
is
one
for
the
houses
of
that
body
to
decide
and
it
is
not
fitting
for
a
court
says
the
court
of
appeals,
a
part
of
another
co-equal
branch
of
the
government
to
enter
into
it.
do
i
mean
by
this
that
it's
never
appropriate
for
a
court
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
since
that
would
inevitably
bring
the
court
into
conflict
with
the
legislative
body
which
has
of
course
given
its
own
opinion
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
enacting
it?
obviously
enough
i
make
no
such
contention.
i
do
say
though
that
considerations
arising
out
of
the
separation
of
powers
make
it
appropriate
and
i
would
say
impair
that
the
court
considered
heavily
the
circumstances
under
which
it
will
undertake
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
now,
that
i
suggest
was
what
the
court
was
doing
in
frothingham
against
mellon.
the
considerations
that
led
the
court
to
withhold
its
hand
there
are
equally
valid
today.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
justice,
i
kind
of
like
to
qualify
you
explicitly
there
there
because
of
course
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
a
modern
view
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
perfectly
plain
that
it
was
not
conception
of
the
first
amendment
when
it
was
written
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
at
all
i
like
it.
my
brother
was
the
treasurer
of
a
congregational
church
in
exeter,
new
hampshire
and
he,
on
behalf
of
the
finance
committee,
wanted
to
borrow
money
on
a
mortgage
in
order
to
put
an
elevator
in
the
church
and
they
discovered
that
the
title
to
the
church
is
in
the
town
of
exeter.
and
they
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
giving
the
title
out
of
the
town
of
exeter
because
constitutional
objections
were
made
that
this
would
be
an
appropriation
for
a
religious
body
and
i
simply
mentioned
this
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
first
amendment
says
there
shall
be
no
appropriation
for
an
establishment
of
religion.
the
first
amendment
does
prohibit
an
establishment
of
religion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
that
what
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion
is
a
complex
and
difficult
matter.
for
example,
we
have
always
had
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
always
had
and
still
have
in
this
country
and
i
hope
we
will
retain
tax
exemption
for
religious
bodies
and
that
is
certainly
a
substantial
financial
aid
to
a
religion
which
until
very
recently
was
never
questioned
in
any
way
and
i
simply
suggest
that
this
is
a
far
more
complex
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
welcome
a
chance
to
get
that
as
the
thread
of
my
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
and
frankly,
i
do
not
myself
place
much
stock
as
a
citizen
and
lawyer
in
the
preferred
status
of
the
first
amendment
i
like
all
of
the
constitution.
i
like
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
prohibition
against
titles
and
mobility
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
hard
to
say
and
hard
to
find
any
historical
or
other
basis
for
saying
that
because
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
it
should
be
treated
in
a
different
way.
this
court’s
great
moments
come
when
it
deals
with
people,
people
who
are
directly
affected
by
government
or
the
law.
i
think
of
frank
against
magnum
and
the
scottsboro
boys
and
shuffling
sam.
the
court
did
not
do
so
well
with
dred
scott,
largely
because
it
lost
sight
of
scott
and
used
his
case
as
a
vehicle
for
seeking
to
dispose
of
a
large
question
which
was
then
rending
the
country
and
which
need
not
have
been
decided
in
order
to
dispose
of
his
case.
when
the
court
has
considered
broad
and
general
questions
in
the
abstract
more
or
less,
it
has
not
always
found
the
results
lastingly
valid.
the
decision
holding
in
new
york
workman's
compensation
act
unconstitutional
might
be
cited
as
an
example
and
if
i
may
say
so
with
great
respect
to
your
honor's
predecessors,
the
decision
which
might
have
been
rendered
if
frothingham
v.
mellon
had
gone
the
other
way.
the
genius
of
the
common
law
and
in
large
measure,
the
talisman
of
constitutional
adjudication
is
the
concrete
case
with
real
and
specific
facts.
we
common
lawyers
do
not
do
so
well
in
the
abstract.
the
present
litigation
is
utterly
abstract.
there
are
no
real
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
is
entirely
in
general
terms.
it
could
be
applicable
to
over
22,000
local
projects
which
had
been
financed
by
the
office
of
education
under
this
statute
all
over
the
country
in
every
state
with
many
types
of
projects
and
almost
limitless
local
variations.
it
is
true
that
in
this
court,
the
appellant
say
that
they
limit
their
complaint
to
practices
in
new
york
city.
even
as
to
that
though,
no
facts
whatever
are
alleged.
everything
is
in
general
terms.
the
appellants
do
not
like
what
is
being
done
under
the
act,
but
was
is
being
done
has
left
to
speculation.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
i
suggest
that
some
things
are
being
done
in
the
sectarian
or
parochial
schools
because
even
the
appellants
concede
that
medical
and
dental
services
may
be
provided
in
sectarian
schools.
i
suppose
this
would
apply
to
psychiatric
services,
remedial
programs
for
retarded
or
disturbed
children
are
not
much
different
and
the
record
in
the
court
below
included
in
an
assertion
that
such
children
will
be
better
reached
if
instruction
is
given
to
them
in
their
own
familiar
surroundings,
but
we
have
no
facts
about
such
matters,
not
because
the
court
below
cut
off
proof
but
because
they
were
never
alleged.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
what
school
and
on
what
page
mr.
justice
is
something
alleged
to
have
been
done?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
read
it
mr.
justice.
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say
mr.
justice
that
they
do
not
allege
tax
which
say
that
at
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time,
something
can
be
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
is
that
issues
of
this
sort
ought
to
be
decided
in
specific
concrete
cases
and
not
in
perfectly
general
terms
and
why
we're
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
i
would
like
to
add
some
facts
upon
which
this
case
in
stand.
now,
why
our
facts
not
alleged?
because
i
submit
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
this
is
all
what
--
this
all
bears
on
standing
to
sue.
they
would
have
standing
if
they
have
alleged
a
specific
concrete
case
and
facts
which
showed
that
they
were
hurt
by
something.
the
reason
that
they
didn't
allege
facts
it
seems
to
me
is
what
they
are
seeking
here
is
a
broad
general
declaration
of
the
statutes
or
about
the
administration
of
the
statute
of
theoretical
determination
divorced
from
any
concrete
impact
on
any
party
in
the
case.
that's
why
i
think
it's
relevant
to
this
point.
some
citizens,
who
happen
to
be
taxpayers
too,
though
i
don't
think
that's
important,
do
not
like
what
the
government
is
doing.
though
as
near
as
i
can
tell,
the
things
they
don't
like
are
being
done
by
officials
of
new
york
state
and
city
governments
and
so
they
sue
two
high
officers
of
the
government
for
what?
for
a
declaration
and
injunction
that
the
very
general
things
they
assert
without
ever
putting
down
the
single
concrete
fact
are
unauthorized
or
unconstitutional.
now,
this
i
submit
is
essentially
a
prayer
for
an
advisory
opinion,
an
opinion
which
is
to
be
rendered
in
broad,
general,
and
essentially
abstract
terms.
let
me
see
if
i
can
test
that
statement.
suppose
this
case
came
here
the
other
way
around.
let
me
suppose
that
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
were
doubtful
and
uncertain
about
their
powers
and
responsibilities
under
the
act.
of
course
they
could
ask
their
general
counsel
or
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
could
request
the
attorney
general
to
give
an
opinion,
but
such
opinions
would
be
advisory
only.
they
would
not
bind
anyone
outside
the
government,
but
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
wanted
a
decision.
so
they
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
asking
for
a
binding
declaration.
against
whom
do
they
file
the
suit?
well,
that's
a
nice
question.
they've
heard
that
mr.
pfeffer
and
know
that
he
has
long
given
thoughtful
consideration
to
these
matters
so
they
named
him
as
the
defendant
and
then
there’s
mr.
brownell,
he
knows
his
way
around
the
government
and
they
name
him
as
the
defendant.
it
really
doesn't
matter
who
they
named
since
no
one
has
any
direct
personal
interest
in
the
question
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
since
all
points
of
view
will
be
presented
as
briefs
filed
by
friends
of
the
court.
in
the
abstract
though,
let
me
observe
and
in
the
absence
of
any
concrete
facts.
i
might
point
out
that
we
have
a
full
court
of
amicus
briefs
here
and
when
i
counted
them
last,
there
were
nine
and
i've
lost
six
to
three.
can
it
be
imagined
for
a
moment
that
the
suit
by
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
would
be
entertained
by
any
court.
i
don't
think
so
and
why
not,
because
it
would
be
seeking
an
essentially
advisory
opinion,
a
decision
in
the
case
which
does
not
really
have
adverse
parties
and
which
did
not
arise
on
specific
concrete
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
mr.
justice
they
do
not
--
they
do
not
allege
a
single
program.
they
do
not
allege
a
single
fact,
a
single
school,
a
single
specific
situation
where
anything
is
done
and
if
something
is
being
done
in
the
sectarian
school
has
become
quite
relevant
to
know
what
is
being
done
and
what
are
the
circumstances
of
that
and
none
of
those
facts
are
alleged
in
anyway.
everything
here
is
in
completely
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
still
think
we
would
have
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
taxpayers
suits
on
the
one
hand
in
that
they
would
not
be
affected
by
what
was
done
in
their
--
either
in
their
pecuniary
or
in
their
personal
interest.
i
also
think
we
have
a
real
problem
here
in
that
commissioner
gardner
--
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
have
no
direct
supervisory
or
administrative
responsibility
here
and
indeed
a
section
of
the
statute
not
quoted
in
our
brief
expressly
prevents
them
from
undertaking
to
operate
the
programs
of
the
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
plans
which
states
that
something
will
be
unconstitutional
or
illegal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
don't
know
what
the
plans
are.
i
agree.
they
are
not
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
assuming
that
there
were
allegations
which
raise
it
and
that
there
were
--
this
was
the
type
of
case
in
view
of
the
essentially
abstract
nature
of
the
claim
that
is
made
which
is
proper
for
the
courts
to
decide
under
what
i
would
call
a
fair
application
of
well
established
principles
of
separation
of
powers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
i'm
not
because
here
the
absence
of
a
concrete
case
is
what
keeps
this
from
being
a
suit
to
use
madison's
raised
of
a
judiciary
nature.
it
is
of
course
proper
for
this
court
to
pass
--
to
consider
and
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
when
that
issue
is
presented
to
it
in
an
actual
controversy
involving
specific
facts,
i
suggest
that
in
this
case,
what
is
sought
is
a
simply
general
abstract
declaration
and
that
frothingham
against
mellon
is
a
great
exemplar
of
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
against
powers
that
this
court
will
not
enter
into
such
an
undertaking.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
maybe
--
may
be
a
part
of
the
trouble.
people
are
talking
in
general
terms.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
the
charge
related
to
specific
facts
and
if
it
were
brought
by
people
who
were
hurt
by
what
has
been
done
of
course
the
court
ought
to
consider
and
decide
the
case.
in
the
hypothetical
suit
that
i
referred
to
brought
by
secretary
gardner
and
commissioner
howe
and
it's
an
obviously
impossible
suit,
the
issues
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
the
interest
of
the
parties
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
those
sought
to
be
raised
here.
the
defendants
would
be
taxpayers
and
citizens
as
the
appellants
are
here.
the
fact
is
that
it
would
make
it
unwise
and
inappropriate
to
decide
that
case
are
equally
applicable
here.
they
are
the
factors
which
lay
behind
this
court’s
decision
in
the
frothingham
case
and
they
remain
equally
valid
today.
few
days
ago,
we
celebrated
the
127th
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
justice
holmes.
in
1904,
shortly
after
he
came
on
this
court,
he
wrote
the
court's
opinion
in
missouri,
kansas
and
texas
railway
company
against
may,
in
which
he
said
“great
constitutional
provisions
must
be
administered
with
caution.
some
play
must
be
allowed
for
the
joints
of
the
machine
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
legislatures
are
ultimate
guardians
of
the
liberty
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
and
quite
as
great
the
degree
as
the
courts.”
this
is
a
case
i
submit
where
it's
appropriate
in
the
proper
application
of
the
constitutionally
established
separation
or
divisions
of
powers
in
this
country
for
this
court
to
refrain
from
rendering
a
decision
until
a
case
of
a
truly
judiciary
nature
arises
and
is
properly
presented
to
the
court.
not
an
abstract
general
case
seeking
a
sweeping
declaration
about
everybody's
rights,
but
a
case
raising
a
specific
question
by
someone
who
was
hurt.
that
will
present
a
proper
case
for
a
judicial
action.
this
is
a
peculiarly
a
situation
where
there
should
be
room
for
play
in
the
joints.
the
questions
involved
here
are
not
ones
of
black
and
white.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
this
is
a
problem
filled
with
so
many
uncertainties,
mr.
justice,
so
many
variables,
so
many
problems
and
difficulties,
it
is
not
wise
and
fitting
it
seems
to
me
for
the
court
to
enter
into
it
in
a
general
and
abstract
way.
but
it
is
wise
for
the
court
to
wait
until
its
rule
is
called
for,
that
of
deciding
a
case
between
parties
of
where
the
people
have
themselves
a
genuine
personal
interest
in
the
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
the
court
has
a
case
like
that
on
its
docket
now
which
will
be
heard
either
later
this
term
or
early
next
term,
the
case
involving
a
city
in
new
york
which
came
up
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i've
already
pointed
out
to
two
provisions
in
this
statute
itself
containing
provision
for
judicial
review
and
that
if
a
plan
was
disapproved
by
the
secretary
or
the
commissioner
on
these
grounds,
the
state
school
authorities
could
directly
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
to
get
the
question
raised.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
question
can
be
raised
and
in
which
if
it
is
raised
it
will
be
raised
in
a
specific
concrete
context.
here
the
appellants
have
conceded
that
medical
and
dental
services
may
be
rendered
to
children
in
sectarian
schools.
they
agree
that
inspection
may
be
given
in
the
public
schools
to
children
from
the
sectarian
schools
and
that
library
services
could
be
given
to
all
children
on
publicly
owned
neutral
ground.
their
complaint
is
against
remedial
and
guidance
services
note
not
some
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
exactly
what
the
issue
will
be
there,
but
i
do
know
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
passed
on
them
it
is
the
basis
of
the
appeal
from
that
decision
which
is
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
moved
to
dismiss
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
had
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
do
not
have
standing
to
maintain
this
act
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
for
such
other
and
further
relief,
is
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
appreciate
it
mr.
justice
but
if
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed
on
any
ground
i
believe
that
that's
appropriate
to
raise
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
understand
that
i'm
making
a
separate
ground.
i'm
trying
to
make
an
argument
in
terms
of
frothingham
against
mellon
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
which
ought
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
would
be
true
of
the
taxpayer
suits
and
the
federal
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
that
is
exemplified
in
a
rather
striking
way
by
this
particular
complaint.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
and
president
are
as
much
want
to
uphold
the
constitution
as
are
the
courts
or
government
lawyers.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
was
long
before
congress,
thoroughly
debated
there,
carefully
drawn
with
the
precise
issue
here
presented
well
in
line
and
finally
resolved
by
the
action
of
congress
and
the
approval
of
the
president.
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
problem
before
congress
involved
not
merely
the
question
of
church
and
state,
but
also
another
great
constitutional
principle,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
provided
as
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
perhaps
made
applicable
to
the
united
states
by
the
fifth
amendment.
this
court
now
has
before
its
certain
welfare
cases
where
it
is
contended
that
if
welfare
is
to
be
given
by
a
state,
it
must
be
made
available
on
a
basis
of
equality
to
all
persons
with
similar
needs
without
the
irrelevant
or
arbitrary
qualifications.
summarily,
congress
could
well
have
concluded
that
if
aid
was
to
be
given
to
needy
children,
or
if
books
were
to
be
provided
for
children
in
school,
these
things
should
be
available
to
all
children
and
that
anything
else
would
be
an
inadmissible
denial
of
equal
protection.
all
that
i
say
now
is
that
these
questions
are
real
ones.
they
are
difficult
ones.
they
were
wrestled
out
by
congress
in
a
way
that
it's
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
admiration
as
well
as
respect.
in
due
course,
this
court
will
have
to
come
to
its
own
conclusion
and
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
the
action
of
congress
or
the
president
though
they
were
aware
of
their
constitutional
duties
is
binding
on
this
court.
but
it
is
entitled
to
respect
and
in
this
situation
to
weight.
this
is,
i
submit
one
of
the
places
where
there
is
some
small
room
for
freedom
in
the
joints
in
our
great
constitutional
structure.
this
court
will
of
course
not
shrink
its
judicial
duty
when
a
truly
concrete
cases
presented
by
someone
who
is
hurt
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
application
of
the
statute.
until
such
a
case
is
presented,
proper
deference
to
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
government,
proper
regard
to
the
great
principles
of
separation
of
powers
requires,
i
submit,
that
the
court
withhold
its
hand.
a
great
predecessor
of
mine
john
w.
davis,
when
president
of
the
american
bar
association
referred
in
his
presidential
address
to
this
court's
power
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
and
the
criticisms
which
had
been
made
of
the
use
of
that
power
and
the
certain
proposals
to
curb
it.
in
discussing
this
matter,
he
said,
there
is
a
curious
misconception
underlying
much
that
is
said
and
written
on
this
subject
as
to
the
duties
that
the
court
is
called
upon
the
discharge.
one
might
suppose
from
some
of
these
outgivings
that
the
court
sat
at
the
outer
gate
of
congress
waiting
to
visit
the
zealous
censorship
on
the
laws
that
issue
from
that
port
and
that
over
then
it
had
a
general
power
of
life
and
death
or
of
approval
or
of
veto.
but
all
thus,
as
are
the
functions
of
the
court,
surely
they
do
not
go
one
step
beyond
the
administration
of
justice
to
individual
litigants.
