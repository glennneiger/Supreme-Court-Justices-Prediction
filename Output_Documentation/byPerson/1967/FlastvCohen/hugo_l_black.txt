black
what
do
you
understand
was
meant
by
that
last
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
legislative
power
to
enact
laws,
and
therefore
we
can't
consider
the
constitutionality
of
any
outcome?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
the
reading
interpretation
of
my
brother
fortas'
case
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
if
you
take
the
position
that's
marbury
versus
madison
was
decided,
this
court
does
have
found,
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
legislation
whether
the
corporations
or
other
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
looked
at
all
these.
do
you
claim
that
any
of
them
detracts
the
plain
allegation
of
the
bill,
that
the
bill
provides
for
using
money
to
give
to
state
churches,
to
state
schools,
to
public
church
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i'm
talking
about
the
acute
issue
they
raise
that
it's
not
constitutional
because
it
provides
for
the
appropriation
of
tax-raised
funds
to
operate
church
schools.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
limiting
your
reference
to
this
to
that
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that,
in
basis
of
section
13
of
the
bill?

(voice

the
meticulous
details
about
where
the
money
was
spent.
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
say
that
they
do
not
charge,
an
ambiguous
language.
the
money
was
being
used
in
this
bill
to
finance
the
construction
of
sectarian
schools.
justice
hugo

so
why
do
they
have
to
alleged
the
facts
about
a
particular
thing
when
they
alleged
it
in
general.
that's
the
general
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
want
to
get
back
to
commonwealth
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
aren't
you
making
the
same
argument
that's
made
in
doremus
everyday
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
claim,
but
it's
not
a
sufficient
cause
to
deny
a
jurisdiction
of
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
get
any
more
vigorous?
he's
in
this
controversy.
it's
a
dispute
between
two
people
charged
by
one
that
the
taxpayer's
money
is
being
spent
to
aid
sectarian
schools
and
teaching
--
teachers
in
those
schools.
justice
hugo
l.

but
the
charge
is
that
the
government
has
been
spending
money
in
this
act
for
that
purpose.
