o.
douglas
counsel,
do
you
know
of
any
better
way
to
establish
an
institution
and
to
finance
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
ask
you
to
define
that,
i
just
put
you
one
simple
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
we're
--
are
you
assuming
that
we
withhold
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
merits,
aren't
you,
and
that’s
not
here,
is
it?
if
the
court
would
sit
in
a
shattering
theory
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
that
this
will
call
all
act
of
