isn't

justice
thurgood

is
it

of
the
new

justice
thurgood

well,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
decide
without
reading
it
whether
it
affects
this
case
of
not.
justice
thurgood

only
thing
we
passed
on
is
this
complaint.
justice

mr.
solicitor
general
was
this
question
was
raised
in
the
district
court
that
it
wasn't
specific,
or
was
it
merely
the
one
point
that
they
did
not
having
the
standing
to
sue.
i
made
a
question
because
it
would
have
been
a
possibility
of
amendment
in
the
district
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
the
complaint
not
dismissed,
wouldn't
it
be
possible
to
find
some
of
those
facts
by
discovery
one
way
or
the
other
which
might
help
everybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
we
have
to
approve
the
plan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
in
fact,
we
don't
know
what
the
plans
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
court
keeps
jurisdiction
to
the
district
court,
we
would
find
out,
wouldn't
we?
