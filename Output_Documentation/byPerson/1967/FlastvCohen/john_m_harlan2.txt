harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
mr.
pfeffer
with
the
solicitor
general's
three-judge
court
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
threshold
question,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
do
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
case
are
you
referring

justice
john
m.
harlan
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
this
complaint
had
two
causes
of
action
have
set
forth
the
unconstitutional
claim
and
the
cause
of
action
in
a
constitutional
claim,
you
would
have
--
a
three-judge
court
would
have
been
required.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
practical
argument,
but
not
a
legal
argument
on
the
equation
of
jurisdiction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
before
you
leave
that,
you
do
say,
do
you
not

your
brief,
you
disclaim
any
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
this
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
however
this
question
was
raised
[indiscernible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
you
understand
the
cause,
why
not
[indiscernible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
pleadings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[indiscernible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
–
in
your
view
is
that
[indiscernible]
sort
of
class
action
[indiscernible]
attacks
the
application
of
this
act
or
of
the
united
states
in
one
