mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
a
group
of
individual
taxpayers
residing
in
the
city
of
new
york
challenging
under
both
establishment
and
free
exercise
clauses
of
the
first
amendment,
the
expenditure
by
the
federal
government
funds
to
provide
teaching
services
and
textbooks
and
church
related
sectarian
schools,
the
government
act
pursuant
to
which
interpretation
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
acts
of
1965.
our
suit
was
brought
and
the
government
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
one
ground
and
one
ground
only
and
that
is
since
the
plaintiffs
were
merely
taxpayers,
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
frothingham
against
mellon,
they
did
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
act
and
its
administration.
we
cross
moved
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
courts
and
justice
frankel
granted
our
motion
and
referred
to
the
three-judge
court,
the
question
of
standing.
this
was
argued
before
the
chief
--
before
the
three-judge
court.
by
a
vote
two
to
one,
the
government's
position
was
upheld
and
with
the
dissent
by
judge
frankel
and
our
complaint
was
dismissed.
the
sole
authority
for
the
dismissal
of
this
complaint,
at
this
level
anyway,
is
that
we
do
not
have
standing
to
sue
and
as
frothingham
constitutes
barring
to
a
suit
by
taxpayers,
challenging
federal
expenditures
of
funds,
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
initial
question
which
the
--
which
we
address
ourselves
to
and
which
the
government
addresses
itself
to
in
its
brief
other
than
the
technical
question
of
the
three-judge
court
which
i
presume
the
government
will
argue,
is
whether
frothingham
presents
a
constitutional
barrier
to
a
taxpayer's
suit.
it's
our
contention
that
unlike
the
companion
suit
of
massachusetts
against
mellon,
which
may
--
which
we
are
willing
to
concede
may
have
serve
as
a
constitutional
barrier
to
taxpayer
suits.
frothingham
was
a
decided
on
a
party
of
judicial
self-restraint
statute
rather
than
constitutional
lack
of
capacity.
i
must
say
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
would
not
concur
with
my
concession
because
according
to
mr.
justice
brandeis,
even
massachusetts
against
mellon
in
which
the
state
of
massachusetts
brought
the
suit
challenging
expenditure,
even
that
was
not
a
case
of
constitutional
lack
of
competence,
but
of
abstention.
in
the
classic
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
ashwander
against
t.v.a.,
he
said,
page
341
of
279
u.s.,
“the
court
developed,
for
its
own
governance
in
the
cases
confessedly
within
its
jurisdiction,
a
series
of
rules
under
which
it
has
avoided
passing
upon
a
large
part
of
all
the
constitutional
questions
pressed
upon
it
for
decision.
they
are
at
least
of
five
of
them,
the
fifth
is
the
following.
the
court
will
not
pass
upon
the
validity
of
a
statute
by
complaint
of
one
who
failed
to
show
that
he
is
injured
by
its
operations.”
in
massachusetts
against
mellon,
the
challenge
of
the
federal
maternity
act
was
not
entertained,
although
made
by
the
commonwealth
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
now,
justice
brandeis
was
one
of
the
justices
of
the
court
which
decided
massachusetts
and
frothingham.
he
participated
in
the
conference
and
presumably
was
in
the
position
to
know
what
the
court
intended
and
according
to
justice
brandeis,
even
massachusetts
does
not
represent
a
constitutional
question
under
office
but
on
the
question
of
judicial
self-restraint.
however
for
the
purpose
of
our
case,
we
need
not
go
that
far
and
we
urge
that
even
if,
even
if
massachusetts
interpret
to
represent
a
determination
that
a
state
had
no
constitutional
power,
for
the
court
has
no
constitutional
power
to
hear
a
case
by
a
state
allegedly
in
behalf
of
its
citizens,
this
does
not
apply
to
the
frothingham
against
mellon
which
was
decided
simultaneously,
but
was
an
entirely
separate
and
independent
case
by
a
taxpayer.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
would
try
to
deal
with
it
–
if
the
court
wants
i
would
be
glad
to
deal
with
it
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
--
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
--
in
the
answering
brief.
if
you
prefer
i'll
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
prefer
deal
with
it
in
our
rebuttal,
unless
the
court
prefers
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
then
turning
to
that
question,
for
the
first
time,
in
its
answering
brief,
not
before
judge
frankel,
not
before
the
three-judge
court
nor
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
but
for
the
first
time
in
its
answering
brief,
the
court
asserts,
the
government
asserts
that
this
case
should
have
been
heard
by
a
single
judge
and
therefore
direct
appeal
is
not
proper.
apparently,
it's
difficult
for
me
fully
to
grasp
the
thrust
of
the
government's
position,
but
apparently
it
appeared
that
it's
that.
our
complaint
asserts
that
the
commissioner
of
education
had
misconstrued
the
statute
and
has
interpreted
to
authorize
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
finance
education
in
parochial
schools.
however,
in
the
alternative,
if
we
are
wrong
and
if
the
commissioner
did
correctly
interpret
the
statute,
we
assert
that
the
statute
to
that
extent
was
unconstitutional.
the
government's
position
apparently
is
that
we
have
pleaded
in
the
alternative.
now
we
do
not
initially
challenge
the
statute
itself,
but
only
its
administration,
a
three-judge
court
is
improper.
i
have
examined
carefully
every
single
one
of
the
decisions
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
i
have
penalized
every
one
of
these
in
my
reply
brief.
i
find
not
a
single
case
cited
by
the
government
or
elsewhere
which
supports
that
proposition.
on
the
contrary,
i
have
cited
at
least
five
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
where
you
have
all
kinds
of
pleadings
of
this
kind
and
assert
first
that
the
statute
was
not
complied
with
or
the
governmental
agency
did
not
act
in
compliance
with
the
statutory
authority,
but
in
the
event
it
did,
that
the
statute
is
valid
and
constitutional.
this
court
has
held
that
the
three-judge
court
is
the
appropriate
in
direct
appeal
is
the
procedure.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
following
cases,
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft,
347
u.s.
535.
the
latest
case
on
this
is
zemel
against
rusk,
381
u.s.
1.
also
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers
versus
jacobsen,
362
u.s.
73
and
lee
against
bickell
of
1934,
292
u.s.
415
and
sterling
against
constantin
287
u.s.
387.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
sir.
now,
the
reason
for
that
i
think
it's
entirely
logical.
suppose
we
had
not
asserted
that
this
--
the
agency
was
acting
beyond
a
statutory
authority
but
had
a
simple
one
cause
of
action,
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
authorizes
--
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
authorizes
this
expenditure.
pursuant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
consistently,
this
court
would
have
insisted
from
the
first
week
question
whether
the
agency
did
act
in
authority
with
the
statute
would
not
reach
a
constitutional
issue
if
it
could
find
that
agency
acted
beyond
its
statutory
authority
in
the
case
after
case
which
i
have
i
cited
in
my
brief
where
the
assertion
was
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
of
course
we
don't
reach
that.
we'll
only
reach
that
in
the
event
we
find
that
the
agency
acted
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority.
therefore,
in
a
sense,
you
might
very
well
say
your
honor.
that
our
assertion
that
the
agency
is
acting
beyond
its
statutory
authority
is
mere
placid.
we
would
have
done
it
anyway.
the
court
would
have
to
decide
that
anyway.
it's
therefore
quite
appropriate,
indeed
you
might
very
well
say
if
you
accept
the
logic,
the
government's
position
of
three-judge
court
is
never
appropriate
because
in
every
case,
you
will
have
to
--
you
can't
attack
a
statute
on
its
face.
once
the
statute
is
passed
you
can't
go
to
court
and
get
it
attacked
and
get
it
declared
constitutional.
you
have
to
wait
until
it's
administered
and
then
it
comes
up
to
initial
question,
did
the
administration
complied
with
the
statutory
intent?
but
that
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
appreciate
why
the
government
has
thought
fit
to
assert
that
this
case
is
not
proper
before
it.
one
more
point
on
this
and
i
refer
--
if
your
honors
please,
i
got
first
to
go
to
the
merits.
suppose
the
government
is
correct,
suppose
the
government
is
right,
what
happens?
the
court
–
the
case
is
remanded
to
whom?
to
judge
frankel
which
is
the
initial
judge.
he
decided
in
our
favor.
he
held
we
did
have,
we
did
have
the
standing.
we
have
to
therefore
go
to
trial,
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
appeal
to
this
court
to
which
time
perhaps
this
court
would
tell
us
we're
wrong.
now,
we
didn't
have
that
which
would
mean
in
a
trial
unnecessary
bearing
upon
the
government
in
defending
this
suit
in
front
of
this
court.
now,
if
there
ever
was
a
case
which
is
ripe
for
decision,
this
case
is.
it
was
argued
first
before
judge
frankel,
briefed
before
him.
it
was
argued
before
the
three-judge
court.
it
was
argued
in
our
brief.
it
was
a
subject
of
it
as
a
hearing,
extensive
hearings
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
every
recognized
the
authority
on
the
subject
has
testified
and
given
the
opinion,
been
subject
of
innumerable
law
review
articles
and
textbooks.
what
additional
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
what
additional
light
can
another
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
decision
before
them
shed
to
help
this
court?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
your
honor,
it's
a
practical
argument.
now,
returning
--
returning
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
only
if
it
is
interpreted
according
to
what
the
government
interprets
that
authorized
the
conduct
which
we
declare
to
be
unconstitutional.
we
believe
that
the
statute
can
be
conserved
or
preserved
by
holding
that
the
court
--
that
the
agency
or
the
commissioner
misinterpreted
the
statute
and
the
authority,
it
does
not
have
a
statutory
authority
to
use
public
funds
for
sectarian
schools.
now,
returning
to
frothingham,
we
suggest
that
the
examination
of
the
opinion
itself
and
comparison
to
the
opinion
with
the
massachusetts
opinion
showed
that
the
court
did
not
intend
there
to
hold
that
it
lacked
constitutional
jurisdiction.
to
give
you
one
or
two,
if
you
want
two
examples,
the
court
asserts
that
if
frothingham
were
allowed
to
sue,
there
would
be
the
danger
of
a
multitude
of
these
civil
suits
and
this
is
of
course
the
practical
point,
you
pointed
out
so
strong,
it's
a
practical
thing,
not
jurisdictional.
the
court
would
not
have
raised
--
asserted
that
practical
consideration
if
the
issue
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
it
will
simply
say,
under
this,
does
not
present
a
case
of
controversy
under
lee
therefore
we
have
to
dismiss.
but
that
went
into
that
and
it
did
raise
that
issue,
that
practical
issue
which
is
an
issue
relevant
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
to
exercise
discretionary
jurisdiction,
but
irrelevant
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
act
at
all,
no
power
to
act
at
all.
similarly,
the
court
referred
to
the
distinguished
case
of
bradfield
against
roberts.
bradfield
against
roberts,
a
taxpayer
suit,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
to
maintain
a
sectarian
hospital
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
suit
was
accepted
and
was
decided
on
the
merits.
in
frothingham,
the
court
said,
“well,
that
case
is
different
because
that
was
considered
as
it
if
were
a
suit
by
a
--
against
a
municipal
corporation.
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
assuming
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
cited
in
(inaudible)
in
this
corporation's
order
(inaudible),
i
don't
remember
what,
in
a
corporation
law
showing
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation,
a
city
is
like
a
municipal
corporation
and
just
like
a
stockholder
is
allowed
to
sue
in
a
court
of
equity
against
waste
by
the
board
of
directors,
so
the
same
way
a
citizen
of
a
city
is
considered
like
a
stockholder
to
sue
the
board
of
directors
or
the
mayor
or
whoever
it
is
for
waste.
that
too,
your
honors,
is
a
question
of
equitable
discretion.
it's
not
a
question
of
constitutional
jurisdiction,
so
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
examination
of
frothingham
on
its
face
indicates
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
not
lack
of
jurisdictional
competence,
but
a
judicial
discretion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
--
as
i
interpret
that
part
of
the
opinion,
that
last
sentence
it's
that
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
in
this
way.
first,
it
determines
that
and
the
previous
language
of
the
court
indicates,
it
determines
that
as
the
court
of
equity
it
will
not
entertain
on
the
theory
of
de
minimis
a
suit
by
an
individual
who
suffered
a
de
minimis
injury.
therefore,
the
court
said
that
this
is
a
decision
made
by
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
separation
of
power
is
not
ever
since
marbury
versus
madison
is
not
a
jurisdictional
power.
the
--
whatever
this
court,
whatever
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
it's
to
that
extent
infringing,
if
you
will,
on
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers.
marbury
versus
madison
said
this
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court.
and
as
we
indicate
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
read
frothingham
that
way.
i
read
frothingham,
the
court's
determination
that
it
will
not
issue
in
effect
in
part
of
the
opinion
where
it
decides
first
as
a
court
of
equity,
that
the
plaintiff
has
no
standing
therefore
dismiss
the
case,
that's
the
end,
there
was
therefore
no
controversy
before
it.
there
was
simply
an
issue,
but
there
was
no
litigant,
therefore
in
that
case,
there's
no
case
of
controversy.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
can
reply
to
that
is
that,
though
mr.
justice
brandeis
has
interpreted
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
was
on
the
bench
then,
and
presumably
he
has
with
the
position
to
know
what
was
this
intended.
this
is
one
loose
sentence
at
the
end
which
i
might
suggest
that
if
that
was
case,
the
court
would
have
hand
it
down,
a
single
opinion
both
in
massachusetts
and
frothingham.
it
carefully
had
two
of
things
with
different
reasoning
with
different
approaches.
now
i
also
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes,
perhaps
an
equity
jurisdiction.
now,
equity
that's
my
argument.
they're
talking
about
equity
jurisdiction
which
is
not
a
question
of
oxley
not
a
question
of
constitutional
jurisdiction.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
pardon?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
my
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
trust
that's
not
what
he
intended
to
say,
couldn't
possibly
have.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
tried
to
find
that
relationship,
but
other
than
the
possibly,
loose
use
of
concluding
sentence
which
there
may
be
more
accurate
psychological
explanation
for
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indeed
it
does
and
in
my
brief,
i
have
listed
and
analyzed
many
cases,
many
cases
both
before
and
after
frothingham.
it
was
the
court
which
did
exactly
that
in
suits
by
taxpayers.
i
have
just
cited
two
for
the
lack
of
--
the
others
are
all
in
my
brief.
one
of
the
case
is
wilson
against
shaw
in
which
the
court
accepted
jurisdiction,
decided
on
the
merits
on
a
taxpayer
suit
challenging
the
building
of
panama
canal,
the
expansion
of
the
panama
canal.
now
the
court
took
that.
if
this
were
a
case
of
competence,
judicial
incompetence,
lack
of
judicial
competence,
now
the
court
would
never
have
proper
merits
for
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that's
exactly
my
position.
now,
assuming
--
assuming
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
in
fact
the
government
does
so
contend.
the
government
does
so
contend
that
wilson
against
shaw
is
overruled
by
frothingham.
well,
if
that's
so
then
i
ask
this
court
to
overrule
frothingham,
but
what
one
court
can
do
another
court
can
undo,
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
court
intended
to
overrule
frothingham
or
with
to
overrule
shaw,
it
did
not
face
them.
it
said
that
wilson
against
shaw
and
bradfield
against
roberts,
and
the
other
case
the
question
was
reserved.
now,
our
argument
that
this
by
the
court
in
frothingham
saying
that
no
case
or
the
question
was
reserved
is
the
determination
that
the
issue
is
not
one
of
jurisdictional
power
or
jurisdictional
--
judicial
power,
but
judicial
discretion
because
ever
since
the
earliest
time
of
the
supreme
court,
it
does
not
give
a
advisory
opinion.
there
must
be
a
case
of
controversy.
therefore,
when
it
did
decide
on
the
merits
in
all
those
cases
even
though
the
question
of
standing
was
raised
and
it
was
consciously
considered
by
the
court,
it
nevertheless
proceeded
to
decide
it
on
the
merits.
i
can
offer
no
explanation
for
that
other
than
a
finding,
a
determination,
yes
we
do
have
--
we
do
have
jurisdiction
under
the
constitution.
now
what
the
court
said
in
frothingham
by
interpreting
this
“at
the
most
we
made
a
mistake
in
exercising
the
jurisdiction
we
have.
perhaps,
we
shouldn't.
in
this
case,
we
will
not
make
that
mistake.
we
will
not
exercise
the
jurisdiction
we
have,”
but
it
could
--
did
not
say
that
those
cases
were
erroneously
decided
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
but
only
perhaps
on
the
question
of
judicial
discretion.
now,
since
frothingham,
--
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
bradfield
against
roberts,
this
is
just
a
case
directly
in
point
to
our
case.
it
was
absolutely
the
same
as
our
case.
it
indicates
that
it
did
intend
to
overrule
bradfield
against
roberts
is
the
fact
that
they
sought
to
distinguish
it
--
mr.
justice
sutherland
so
distinguishes
it
in
frothingham,
that
doesn't
indicate
an
intent
to
overrule.
how
did
they
seek
to
distinguish
it?
he
said,
“that
was
treated
by
the
lower
court
as
if
it
were
a
suit
against
a
municipal
corporation,
a
taxpayer's
suit
against
a
municipal
corporation
and
of
course
said
that
we
consider
those
somewhat
similar
to
a
stockholder's
suit
and
therefore
we
accept
it.”
we
have
argued
that
if
that
is
so,
we're
trying
to
doubt
the
validity
of
that
distinction
because
many
--
there's
a
variety
of
reasons
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
but
even
if
that
were
so,
then
this
case
is
exactly
our
old
force
with
bradfield
against
roberts.
bradfield
against
roberts
was
a
suit
not
against
the
municipal
government
of
the
district
of
columbia,
mr.
roberts
was
the
secretary
of
treasury
of
the
united
states.
the
expenditures
which
were
challenged
were
the
building
of
a
hospital
didn't
come
from
taxes
paid
exclusively
by
residents
of
district
of
columbia.
it
was
paid,
came
out
of
the
general
treasury
of
the
united
states,
paid
off
by
120
million
americans
at
that
time.
the
suit
was
defended
not
by
the
corporation
council
of
the
district
of
columbia
but
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
there
was
a
corporation,
a
municipal
corporation
in
sense
of
--
but
they
were
the
instrumentality
by
which
the
money
was
passed
over
to
the
sectarian
institutions.
every
one
of
these
factors
are
present
here.
our
suit
is
against
a
national
official,
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
special
education
not
local.
it's
being
defended
by
the
department
of
justice
not
by
the
corporation
counsel
of
city
of
new
york
and
all
on
respect
it's
entirely
identical.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
just
one
short
addendum
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas
about
the
separation
of
powers.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
this
is
a
–
indeed
it
invoked
the
opening
words
of
the
bill
of
rights,
congress
will
make
no
law
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof.
in
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
i
think
separation
of
powers
argument
is
least
apposite.
i
will
remind,
your
honors,
of
the
classic
statement
in
barnette,
west
virginia
against
barnette
case
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
withdraw
certain
subjects
from
the
vicissitudes
of
political
controversy,
to
place
them
beyond
the
reach
of
the
majorities
and
officials
to
establish
them
as
legal
principles
to
be
applied
by
the
courts.
one's
the
right
for
life,
liberty,
and
property,
free
speech,
a
free
press,
freedom
of
worship
and
assembly
and
other
fundamental
rights
may
not
be
submitted
to
vote;
they
depend
on
the
outcome
of
no
election.
now
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
prior
number
of
cases
after
frothingham
in
which
taxpayer
suits
similar
to
the
present
one
were
accepted
by
this
court.
because
of
lack
of
time
i
will
rely
on
my
brief
rather
than
to
summarize
those
cases.
i
come
now
to
the
--
well,
i
believe
the
major
consideration,
should
the
court
exercise
that
discretion
which
the
constitution
gives
it
in
accepting
or
rejecting
this
similar
case.
initially,
i
want
to
make
one
point
that
should
the
court
decide
to
follow
the
discretion
of
frothingham
and
hold
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can't
sue,
or
the
plaintiffs
--
taxpayers
cannot
sue
in
any
first
amendment
case
on
the
establishment
clause
involving
expense
through
federal
funds
then
there
were
simply
no
way,
none
that
i
know
of,
whereby
a
congressional
act
granting
a
million
dollars
to
a
church,
to
build
a
church
can
be
challenged
in
the
courts.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
solicitor
general's
suggests
a
variety
of
the
--
none
of
which
are
applicable
to
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
for
example
that
the
state
can
conceivably
sue
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
this
law.
but
the
stand
of
new
york
has
taken
the
position
that
this
is
not,
it
has
no
jurisdiction
here.
new
york
had
--
where
this
case
originated,
new
york
has
a
constitutional
provision
specifically
forbidding,
specifically
forbidding
this
type
of
expenditure
which
is
being
carried
on
under
the
federal
act
by
the
commissioner
of
education.
and
an
opinion
which
was
requested
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
have
furnished
the
clerk
of
this
court
the
copy
of
that
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
for
state
department
of
education,
asking
whether
--
the
question
was,
could
the
state
of
new
york
cooperate
whether
the
--
from
the
case
of
a
federal
act
because
of
its
own
constitutional
prohibitions?
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
attorney
for
commissioner
of
education
said,
“yes,
because
this
is
not
state
money.”
the
state
of
new
york
is
merely
acting
as
the
conduit,
merely
acting
as
conduit
to
transfer
the
federal
money
to
the
schools.
now,
the
federal
government
takes
a
position
that
this
is
state
responsibility,
the
state's
exposition
is
that
this
is
the
federal
responsibility.
the
result
is,
nobody
can
challenge.
the
state
of
new
york
says,
“we
have
no
grievance
because
not
a
penny
of
our
money
is
being
involved
here.
now,
there
is
many
reasons
why
the
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
first
and
foremost,
this
is
--
the
issues
in
this
case
are
just
the
type
of
questions
which
a
court
should
have
defied
upon
on
the
day
this
court
was
established
in
1789.
this
is
a
forum
to
determine
the
constitutional
application
of
federal
statutes.
there
is
no
other
forum.
second,
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
the
court,
the
federal
courts
ever
since
the
bill
of
rights
was
written,
it
hasn't
been
pointed
out,
they
definitely
pointed
out,
the
debate
on
having
the
bill
of
rights,
that
the
courts
are
the
peculiar
guardians
of
the
bill
of
rights.
it
is
to
the
courts
which
an
aggrieved
citizen
goes
to,
to
determine
whether
the
bill
of
rights
is
being
adhered
to
or
violated.
this
would
be
the
only
case,
the
only
area
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
would
tie
for
want
of
practical
reasons.
there
is
no
other
part
of
the
the
bill
of
rights,
from
the
first
through
to
the
tenth
amendment
or
the
eight
amendment,
which
isn't
somebody
who
can
go
to
the
courts
and
get
a
judicial
determination,
except
if
frothingham
is
followed
except
this.
for
all
practical
purposes,
this
constitutes,
you
might
almost
say,
a
repeal
of
the
bill
of
establishments
clause
insofar
as
it
concerns
governmental
expenditures.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
have
said,
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
would
object
to
them
nor
do
i
concede
of
any
case.
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
never
has
been
a
case
that
i
know
of
in
which
a
government
would
probably
have
challenged
the
federal
expenditure
under
the
first
amendment.
i've
know
of
no
such
case.
moreover,
if
the
--
this
case
is
barred
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
states
have
done,
at
least
one,
two
other
states
have
followed
the
opinion
of
the
new
york
attorney
general
in
saying
that
they
can
that
those
private
--
that
the
state
can't
act
as
a
conduit
to
transfer
the
money
to
the
private
school
because
as
they
have
no
grievance.
they
have
no
grievance
one
way,
they
are
completely
without
grievance.
if
the
money
can
be
transferred
in
the
deal
--
on
the
type
of
two
the
state
has
very
relatively
minor
part
in
this
act.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they
--
ones
originate
the
plan
as
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
doesn't
have
an
authorized
--
it
authorized
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
time
to
get
around.
you
might
very
well
argue
that
[indiscernible]
has
no
standing.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
presume
massachusetts
know
why
a
suit
brought
in
the
sense
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
on
behalf
of
its
residents.
now,
there
is
one
--
another
factor
which
the
government
has
asserted
in
its
brief
which
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
the
contention
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
very
complex
and
therefore
it's
not
in
--
the
taxpayer's
action
is
not
appropriate
means
of
securing
the
judicial
determination
of
it.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple,
child's
play,
compared
to
those
which
were
involved
in
apportionment
cases.
apportionment
cases
that
involve
congressional
districts,
state
upper
chamber
districts,
state
lower
chamber
districts
under
the
committee
of
municipal
districts,
municipal
apportionment
districts,
each
district,
each
of
these
districts
is
an
island
to
itself
must
be
decided
by
a
court
individually.
yet
the
court
has
taken
ever
since
baker
against
carr,
has
taken
suits
which
are
the
equivalent
of
taxpayers
suit,
a
suit
of
an
individual
citizen.
one
individual
citizen
who
has
relationship
to
the
whole
area
of
representation
is
similar
to
a
taxpayer's
relationship
to
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds.
he
is
in
the
same
concept,
the
same
category
of
de
minimis.
there
is
anything
hardly
more
de
minimis
than
the
value
of
an
individual
citizen
both
in
respect
to,
let's
say,
congressional
representation
which
represents
the
half
the
million
people.
yet
this
court
ever
since
baker
versus
carr
and
even
before
baker
against
carr,
never
had
the
problems
of
that,
never
doubted
that
the
individual
citizens
whose
interest
is
so
minute
nevertheless
has
standing
to
bring
this
suit.
and
as
i
say,
the
issue
there
is
far
more
complex
than
the
issues
here.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
de
minimis
on
which
filing
was
based
has
no
relevancy
under
the
first
amendment
and
it
doesn't
have
under
the
citizenship's
right
to
participate
in
--
select
to
represent
this
government.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
constitution
--
as
far
as
constitutional
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
no,
as
far
as
judicial
discretion
is
concerned,
yes.
this
court
had
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
what
i
am
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
discretion
is
a
broad
sense.
what
i'm
referring
it
to
justice
brandies'
rules
of
self-governance
as
set
forth
in
the
ashwander
against
tva.
he
said
over
the
years,
this
court
has
developed
a
pattern
of
what
case
it
will
take,
what
case
it
will
not
take.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
court
had
a
supervisory
capacity
over
to
this
question
in
the
district
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
this
court
can
very
well
hold
that
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
involved,
the
court's
sound
discretion
is
required
the
acceptance
of
the
suit,
pure
due
process.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
wilson
against
shaw,
the
court
took
jurisdiction
of
the
suit
against
panama
canal?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
--
oh,
i
am
saying
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
i'm
convinced
the
court
has
jurisdiction
even
if
there
were
no
first
amendment
case.
i
do
not
have,
just
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
first
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
as
far
as
[indiscernible]
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
system
is
concerned,
yes.
i
find
nothing
in
the
case
of
this
court
which
is
decided
to
contrary.
i
am
now
yielding
10
minutes
of
my
time
for
senator
ervin
and
i
will
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
first,
a
brief
comment
on
hypothetical
case
of
gardner
against
[indiscernible]
and
how
it's
distinguished
from
the
very
real
case,
flast
against
gardner.
if
the
--
if
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
were
to
bring
this
type
of
suit,
that
the
solicitor
general
referred
to,
the
only
consummation
could
be
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
law
is
or
is
not
constitutional.
that
would
indeed
be
an
advisory
opinion.
now,
perhaps
that
is
a
case
of
controversy
although
that
is
not
100%
certain.
but
flast
against
gardner
does
not
call
for
an
advisory
opinion.
it
calls
for
specific
injunction
against
mr.
gardner,
that's
hardly
is
an
advisory
opinion
and
certainly
is
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
we
ought
to
--
the
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction,
injunctive
relief
or
both.
secondly,
i
think
i
also
ought
to
be
called
the
court's
attention
that
since
this
suit
was
started,
and
since
there's
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
the
issue,
and
the
question,
the
facts
of
governmental
expenditure,
the
expenditure
of
funds
to
finance
the
construction
of
sectarian
schools
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
had
only
in
the
past
two
months,
extended
the
bill
for
another
--
the
law
for
another
three
or
four
years
which
at
this
point
may
very
well
be
held
to
be
a
legislative
acceptance
of
the
department's
determination,
that
indeed
the
act
does
authorize
the
expenditures
which
we
are
challenging
in
this
case,
so
that
they
very
well
be
even
in
that
basis,
in
that
basis
that
the
act
has
now
have
been
in
effect
legislatively
construed
and
therefore
would
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
but
the
thrust,
the
crux
of
our
complaint
is
that
the
whole
act
is
not
unconstitutional.
this
entire
program
is
not
unconstitutional
but
unconstitutional
at
most
is
one
--
two
sets
of
them.
one
of
type
and
one
type
of
two
which
we
say,
we
say
that
at
best
gives
the
administrator
an
option.
you
can
do
--
you
can
enforce
this
one
of
two
ways.
you
can
enforce
it
in
the
way
which
we
suggest
through
giving
these
special
services
in
nonsectarian
auspices,
open
to
all
children
that
would
raise
no
constitutional
issue.
or
you
can
--
you
can
enforce
in
a
different
way
which
does
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
the
administration
has
taken
the
line
of
approach
and
we
assert
that
if
this
is
what
is
authorized
by
the
act,
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it
would
be
completely
impossible.
we'd
have
to
prove,
we
have
to
prove
and
would
be
impossible
to
prove
it.
now,
all
we
can
do
is
in
all
cases
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
as
i
would
say,
we
are
attacking
--
we
are
attacking
the
secretary's
determination,
the
secretary's
determination
that
it
is
constitutional
all
over
the
united
states
to
use
federal
funds
to
finance
the
teaching
in
sectarian
schools.
now
we
prove
our
case
--
we
prove
our
case
especially
(a)
that
that
is
being
done
at
least
in
one
place
and
(b)
that
the
secretary
has
so
approved
it.
this
is
our
case.
now,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
been
done
in
massachusetts,
in
pennsylvania
where
a
similar
suit
is
pending.
the
new
york
times
reported
just
the
other
day
that's
being
done
in
new
jersey
and
certainly
under
the
direction
of
[indiscernible]
and
i'm
certain
its
being
done
in
other
places
as
well.
but
to
get
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court,
we
have
to
establish
at
least
one
place
where
it's
truly,
else
that
it's
truly
an
advisory
opinion
and
no
case
of
controversy.
i
want
to
make
one
more
point
about
the
three-judge
court
and
direct
appeal
here
being
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
it
is.
this
court
has
taken
cases
from
a
one-judge
court
and
bypassed
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
felt
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest,
in
the
national
interest,
it
made
--
this
court
could
very
well
hold.
now
even
if
this
work,
decided
by
judge
frankel
alone,
the
issue
is
of
such
great
significance
required
an
expedition
determination
that
the
court
could
bypass
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
now,
i
want
to
assure
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
case
which
i
put
my
reply
brief
that
bypassing
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
jurisdictional
matter
that
even
if
this
were
not
a
three-judge
court,
even
this
case
had
been
decided
by
one
judge,
it
would
have
been
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
like
to
believe
that,
but
whenever
that
it's
still
within
the
power
of
the
court,
i
think
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
it
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
the
new
york
state
suit
which
referred
to
(a)
does
not
--
that
raises
–
does
not
raise
title
ii
which
is
raised
in
this
case,
(b)
it
raises
issue
which
are
not
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
case
which
was
taken
in
the
new
york
courts?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that
comes
up
partly
under
this
--
it
partly
comes
up
under
the
statute.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
under
title
ii
but
even
under
title
i.
that
case
allegedly
could
not
apply
with
the
reply
brief.
certain
conduct
which
are
not
authorized
by
the
commissioner
of
education
and
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
for
example,
we
allege
there
that
the
board
of
education
has
allowed
discretion
on
public
school
teachers
to
go
into
the
parochial
schools
and
teach
them
and
be
paid
off
from
the
fund.
this
we
contend
at
all.
it's
authorized
either
by
the
statute
or
by
the
health
--
by
the
secretary's
determination.
how
could
we
bring
such
suit
in
the
federal
court?
we
certainly
would
be
told
you
go
to
the
state
court
and
exhaust
your
state's
remedies.
for
that
reason,
not
for
any
other
reasons
that
that
suit
is
brought
here.
finally,
the
theoretical,
completely
theoretical
idea
that
there
is
a
remedy
elsewhere,
there
isn't.
there
is
no
more
remedy
here
than
there
was
in
baker
against
carr.
baker
against
carr,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
a
dissenting
opinion
he
stated
in
colegrove
against
green
or
you
can
go
to
the
legislature
--
to
state
legislature,
they'll
remedy,
whatever
grievance
you
have,
but
of
course
it
didn't
because
they
have
the
state
in
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo.
every
single
state
has
a
spec
as
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo.
it
warranted
the
federal
court
and
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
let
it
go
with
the
proper
court
and
to
find
the
rationalization
for
it
as
new
york
has
done
by
saying,
“well,
we're
just
a
conduit,
we
don't
really
exercise
determination”
and
therefore
any
grievance
you
have
should
go
to
the
federal
government.
we
have
called
it
the
game
of
[indiscernible]
where
everybody
hit
the
[indiscernible]
to
get
the
ball
to
the
other
side,
because
you're
responsiblity.
now,
between
that
the
constitution
falls
to
the
ground
and
nobody
has
responsibility
for
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
a
group
of
individual
taxpayers
residing
in
the
city
of
new
york
challenging
under
both
establishment
and
free
exercise
clauses
of
the
first
amendment,
the
expenditure
by
the
federal
government
funds
to
provide
teaching
services
and
textbooks
and
church
related
sectarian
schools,
the
government
act
pursuant
to
which
interpretation
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
acts
of
1965.
our
suit
was
brought
and
the
government
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
one
ground
and
one
ground
only
and
that
is
since
the
plaintiffs
were
merely
taxpayers,
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
frothingham
against
mellon,
they
did
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
act
and
its
administration.
we
cross
moved
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
courts
and
justice
frankel
granted
our
motion
and
referred
to
the
three-judge
court,
the
question
of
standing.
this
was
argued
before
the
chief
--
before
the
three-judge
court.
by
a
vote
two
to
one,
the
government's
position
was
upheld
and
with
the
dissent
by
judge
frankel
and
our
complaint
was
dismissed.
the
sole
authority
for
the
dismissal
of
this
complaint,
at
this
level
anyway,
is
that
we
do
not
have
standing
to
sue
and
as
frothingham
constitutes
barring
to
a
suit
by
taxpayers,
challenging
federal
expenditures
of
funds,
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
initial
question
which
the
--
which
we
address
ourselves
to
and
which
the
government
addresses
itself
to
in
its
brief
other
than
the
technical
question
of
the
three-judge
court
which
i
presume
the
government
will
argue,
is
whether
frothingham
presents
a
constitutional
barrier
to
a
taxpayer's
suit.
it's
our
contention
that
unlike
the
companion
suit
of
massachusetts
against
mellon,
which
may
--
which
we
are
willing
to
concede
may
have
serve
as
a
constitutional
barrier
to
taxpayer
suits.
frothingham
was
a
decided
on
a
party
of
judicial
self-restraint
statute
rather
than
constitutional
lack
of
capacity.
i
must
say
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
would
not
concur
with
my
concession
because
according
to
mr.
justice
brandeis,
even
massachusetts
against
mellon
in
which
the
state
of
massachusetts
brought
the
suit
challenging
expenditure,
even
that
was
not
a
case
of
constitutional
lack
of
competence,
but
of
abstention.
in
the
classic
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
ashwander
against
t.v.a.,
he
said,
page
341
of
279
u.s.,
“the
court
developed,
for
its
own
governance
in
the
cases
confessedly
within
its
jurisdiction,
a
series
of
rules
under
which
it
has
avoided
passing
upon
a
large
part
of
all
the
constitutional
questions
pressed
upon
it
for
decision.
they
are
at
least
of
five
of
them,
the
fifth
is
the
following.
the
court
will
not
pass
upon
the
validity
of
a
statute
by
complaint
of
one
who
failed
to
show
that
he
is
injured
by
its
operations.”
in
massachusetts
against
mellon,
the
challenge
of
the
federal
maternity
act
was
not
entertained,
although
made
by
the
commonwealth
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
now,
justice
brandeis
was
one
of
the
justices
of
the
court
which
decided
massachusetts
and
frothingham.
he
participated
in
the
conference
and
presumably
was
in
the
position
to
know
what
the
court
intended
and
according
to
justice
brandeis,
even
massachusetts
does
not
represent
a
constitutional
question
under
office
but
on
the
question
of
judicial
self-restraint.
however
for
the
purpose
of
our
case,
we
need
not
go
that
far
and
we
urge
that
even
if,
even
if
massachusetts
interpret
to
represent
a
determination
that
a
state
had
no
constitutional
power,
for
the
court
has
no
constitutional
power
to
hear
a
case
by
a
state
allegedly
in
behalf
of
its
citizens,
this
does
not
apply
to
the
frothingham
against
mellon
which
was
decided
simultaneously,
but
was
an
entirely
separate
and
independent
case
by
a
taxpayer.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
would
try
to
deal
with
it
–
if
the
court
wants
i
would
be
glad
to
deal
with
it
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
--
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
--
in
the
answering
brief.
if
you
prefer
i'll
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
prefer
deal
with
it
in
our
rebuttal,
unless
the
court
prefers
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
then
turning
to
that
question,
for
the
first
time,
in
its
answering
brief,
not
before
judge
frankel,
not
before
the
three-judge
court
nor
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
but
for
the
first
time
in
its
answering
brief,
the
court
asserts,
the
government
asserts
that
this
case
should
have
been
heard
by
a
single
judge
and
therefore
direct
appeal
is
not
proper.
apparently,
it's
difficult
for
me
fully
to
grasp
the
thrust
of
the
government's
position,
but
apparently
it
appeared
that
it's
that.
our
complaint
asserts
that
the
commissioner
of
education
had
misconstrued
the
statute
and
has
interpreted
to
authorize
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
finance
education
in
parochial
schools.
however,
in
the
alternative,
if
we
are
wrong
and
if
the
commissioner
did
correctly
interpret
the
statute,
we
assert
that
the
statute
to
that
extent
was
unconstitutional.
the
government's
position
apparently
is
that
we
have
pleaded
in
the
alternative.
now
we
do
not
initially
challenge
the
statute
itself,
but
only
its
administration,
a
three-judge
court
is
improper.
i
have
examined
carefully
every
single
one
of
the
decisions
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
i
have
penalized
every
one
of
these
in
my
reply
brief.
i
find
not
a
single
case
cited
by
the
government
or
elsewhere
which
supports
that
proposition.
on
the
contrary,
i
have
cited
at
least
five
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
where
you
have
all
kinds
of
pleadings
of
this
kind
and
assert
first
that
the
statute
was
not
complied
with
or
the
governmental
agency
did
not
act
in
compliance
with
the
statutory
authority,
but
in
the
event
it
did,
that
the
statute
is
valid
and
constitutional.
this
court
has
held
that
the
three-judge
court
is
the
appropriate
in
direct
appeal
is
the
procedure.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
following
cases,
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft,
347
u.s.
535.
the
latest
case
on
this
is
zemel
against
rusk,
381
u.s.
1.
also
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers
versus
jacobsen,
362
u.s.
73
and
lee
against
bickell
of
1934,
292
u.s.
415
and
sterling
against
constantin
287
u.s.
387.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
sir.
now,
the
reason
for
that
i
think
it's
entirely
logical.
suppose
we
had
not
asserted
that
this
--
the
agency
was
acting
beyond
a
statutory
authority
but
had
a
simple
one
cause
of
action,
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
authorizes
--
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
authorizes
this
expenditure.
pursuant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
consistently,
this
court
would
have
insisted
from
the
first
week
question
whether
the
agency
did
act
in
authority
with
the
statute
would
not
reach
a
constitutional
issue
if
it
could
find
that
agency
acted
beyond
its
statutory
authority
in
the
case
after
case
which
i
have
i
cited
in
my
brief
where
the
assertion
was
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
of
course
we
don't
reach
that.
we'll
only
reach
that
in
the
event
we
find
that
the
agency
acted
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority.
therefore,
in
a
sense,
you
might
very
well
say
your
honor.
that
our
assertion
that
the
agency
is
acting
beyond
its
statutory
authority
is
mere
placid.
we
would
have
done
it
anyway.
the
court
would
have
to
decide
that
anyway.
it's
therefore
quite
appropriate,
indeed
you
might
very
well
say
if
you
accept
the
logic,
the
government's
position
of
three-judge
court
is
never
appropriate
because
in
every
case,
you
will
have
to
--
you
can't
attack
a
statute
on
its
face.
once
the
statute
is
passed
you
can't
go
to
court
and
get
it
attacked
and
get
it
declared
constitutional.
you
have
to
wait
until
it's
administered
and
then
it
comes
up
to
initial
question,
did
the
administration
complied
with
the
statutory
intent?
but
that
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
appreciate
why
the
government
has
thought
fit
to
assert
that
this
case
is
not
proper
before
it.
one
more
point
on
this
and
i
refer
--
if
your
honors
please,
i
got
first
to
go
to
the
merits.
suppose
the
government
is
correct,
suppose
the
government
is
right,
what
happens?
the
court
–
the
case
is
remanded
to
whom?
to
judge
frankel
which
is
the
initial
judge.
he
decided
in
our
favor.
he
held
we
did
have,
we
did
have
the
standing.
we
have
to
therefore
go
to
trial,
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
appeal
to
this
court
to
which
time
perhaps
this
court
would
tell
us
we're
wrong.
now,
we
didn't
have
that
which
would
mean
in
a
trial
unnecessary
bearing
upon
the
government
in
defending
this
suit
in
front
of
this
court.
now,
if
there
ever
was
a
case
which
is
ripe
for
decision,
this
case
is.
it
was
argued
first
before
judge
frankel,
briefed
before
him.
it
was
argued
before
the
three-judge
court.
it
was
argued
in
our
brief.
it
was
a
subject
of
it
as
a
hearing,
extensive
hearings
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
every
recognized
the
authority
on
the
subject
has
testified
and
given
the
opinion,
been
subject
of
innumerable
law
review
articles
and
textbooks.
what
additional
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
what
additional
light
can
another
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
decision
before
them
shed
to
help
this
court?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
your
honor,
it's
a
practical
argument.
now,
returning
--
returning
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
only
if
it
is
interpreted
according
to
what
the
government
interprets
that
authorized
the
conduct
which
we
declare
to
be
unconstitutional.
we
believe
that
the
statute
can
be
conserved
or
preserved
by
holding
that
the
court
--
that
the
agency
or
the
commissioner
misinterpreted
the
statute
and
the
authority,
it
does
not
have
a
statutory
authority
to
use
public
funds
for
sectarian
schools.
now,
returning
to
frothingham,
we
suggest
that
the
examination
of
the
opinion
itself
and
comparison
to
the
opinion
with
the
massachusetts
opinion
showed
that
the
court
did
not
intend
there
to
hold
that
it
lacked
constitutional
jurisdiction.
to
give
you
one
or
two,
if
you
want
two
examples,
the
court
asserts
that
if
frothingham
were
allowed
to
sue,
there
would
be
the
danger
of
a
multitude
of
these
civil
suits
and
this
is
of
course
the
practical
point,
you
pointed
out
so
strong,
it's
a
practical
thing,
not
jurisdictional.
the
court
would
not
have
raised
--
asserted
that
practical
consideration
if
the
issue
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
it
will
simply
say,
under
this,
does
not
present
a
case
of
controversy
under
lee
therefore
we
have
to
dismiss.
but
that
went
into
that
and
it
did
raise
that
issue,
that
practical
issue
which
is
an
issue
relevant
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
to
exercise
discretionary
jurisdiction,
but
irrelevant
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
act
at
all,
no
power
to
act
at
all.
similarly,
the
court
referred
to
the
distinguished
case
of
bradfield
against
roberts.
bradfield
against
roberts,
a
taxpayer
suit,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
to
maintain
a
sectarian
hospital
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
suit
was
accepted
and
was
decided
on
the
merits.
in
frothingham,
the
court
said,
“well,
that
case
is
different
because
that
was
considered
as
it
if
were
a
suit
by
a
--
against
a
municipal
corporation.
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
assuming
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
cited
in
(inaudible)
in
this
corporation's
order
(inaudible),
i
don't
remember
what,
in
a
corporation
law
showing
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation,
a
city
is
like
a
municipal
corporation
and
just
like
a
stockholder
is
allowed
to
sue
in
a
court
of
equity
against
waste
by
the
board
of
directors,
so
the
same
way
a
citizen
of
a
city
is
considered
like
a
stockholder
to
sue
the
board
of
directors
or
the
mayor
or
whoever
it
is
for
waste.
that
too,
your
honors,
is
a
question
of
equitable
discretion.
it's
not
a
question
of
constitutional
jurisdiction,
so
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
examination
of
frothingham
on
its
face
indicates
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
not
lack
of
jurisdictional
competence,
but
a
judicial
discretion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
--
as
i
interpret
that
part
of
the
opinion,
that
last
sentence
it's
that
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
in
this
way.
first,
it
determines
that
and
the
previous
language
of
the
court
indicates,
it
determines
that
as
the
court
of
equity
it
will
not
entertain
on
the
theory
of
de
minimis
a
suit
by
an
individual
who
suffered
a
de
minimis
injury.
therefore,
the
court
said
that
this
is
a
decision
made
by
a
court
of
equity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
separation
of
power
is
not
ever
since
marbury
versus
madison
is
not
a
jurisdictional
power.
the
--
whatever
this
court,
whatever
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
it's
to
that
extent
infringing,
if
you
will,
on
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers.
marbury
versus
madison
said
this
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court.
and
as
we
indicate
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
read
frothingham
that
way.
i
read
frothingham,
the
court's
determination
that
it
will
not
issue
in
effect
in
part
of
the
opinion
where
it
decides
first
as
a
court
of
equity,
that
the
plaintiff
has
no
standing
therefore
dismiss
the
case,
that's
the
end,
there
was
therefore
no
controversy
before
it.
there
was
simply
an
issue,
but
there
was
no
litigant,
therefore
in
that
case,
there's
no
case
of
controversy.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
can
reply
to
that
is
that,
though
mr.
justice
brandeis
has
interpreted
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
was
on
the
bench
then,
and
presumably
he
has
with
the
position
to
know
what
was
this
intended.
this
is
one
loose
sentence
at
the
end
which
i
might
suggest
that
if
that
was
case,
the
court
would
have
hand
it
down,
a
single
opinion
both
in
massachusetts
and
frothingham.
it
carefully
had
two
of
things
with
different
reasoning
with
different
approaches.
now
i
also
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes,
perhaps
an
equity
jurisdiction.
now,
equity
that's
my
argument.
they're
talking
about
equity
jurisdiction
which
is
not
a
question
of
oxley
not
a
question
of
constitutional
jurisdiction.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
pardon?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
my
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
trust
that's
not
what
he
intended
to
say,
couldn't
possibly
have.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
tried
to
find
that
relationship,
but
other
than
the
possibly,
loose
use
of
concluding
sentence
which
there
may
be
more
accurate
psychological
explanation
for
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indeed
it
does
and
in
my
brief,
i
have
listed
and
analyzed
many
cases,
many
cases
both
before
and
after
frothingham.
it
was
the
court
which
did
exactly
that
in
suits
by
taxpayers.
i
have
just
cited
two
for
the
lack
of
--
the
others
are
all
in
my
brief.
one
of
the
case
is
wilson
against
shaw
in
which
the
court
accepted
jurisdiction,
decided
on
the
merits
on
a
taxpayer
suit
challenging
the
building
of
panama
canal,
the
expansion
of
the
panama
canal.
now
the
court
took
that.
if
this
were
a
case
of
competence,
judicial
incompetence,
lack
of
judicial
competence,
now
the
court
would
never
have
proper
merits
for
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that's
exactly
my
position.
now,
assuming
--
assuming
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
in
fact
the
government
does
so
contend.
the
government
does
so
contend
that
wilson
against
shaw
is
overruled
by
frothingham.
well,
if
that's
so
then
i
ask
this
court
to
overrule
frothingham,
but
what
one
court
can
do
another
court
can
undo,
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
court
intended
to
overrule
frothingham
or
with
to
overrule
shaw,
it
did
not
face
them.
it
said
that
wilson
against
shaw
and
bradfield
against
roberts,
and
the
other
case
the
question
was
reserved.
now,
our
argument
that
this
by
the
court
in
frothingham
saying
that
no
case
or
the
question
was
reserved
is
the
determination
that
the
issue
is
not
one
of
jurisdictional
power
or
jurisdictional
--
judicial
power,
but
judicial
discretion
because
ever
since
the
earliest
time
of
the
supreme
court,
it
does
not
give
a
advisory
opinion.
there
must
be
a
case
of
controversy.
therefore,
when
it
did
decide
on
the
merits
in
all
those
cases
even
though
the
question
of
standing
was
raised
and
it
was
consciously
considered
by
the
court,
it
nevertheless
proceeded
to
decide
it
on
the
merits.
i
can
offer
no
explanation
for
that
other
than
a
finding,
a
determination,
yes
we
do
have
--
we
do
have
jurisdiction
under
the
constitution.
now
what
the
court
said
in
frothingham
by
interpreting
this
“at
the
most
we
made
a
mistake
in
exercising
the
jurisdiction
we
have.
perhaps,
we
shouldn't.
in
this
case,
we
will
not
make
that
mistake.
we
will
not
exercise
the
jurisdiction
we
have,”
but
it
could
--
did
not
say
that
those
cases
were
erroneously
decided
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
but
only
perhaps
on
the
question
of
judicial
discretion.
now,
since
frothingham,
--
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
bradfield
against
roberts,
this
is
just
a
case
directly
in
point
to
our
case.
it
was
absolutely
the
same
as
our
case.
it
indicates
that
it
did
intend
to
overrule
bradfield
against
roberts
is
the
fact
that
they
sought
to
distinguish
it
--
mr.
justice
sutherland
so
distinguishes
it
in
frothingham,
that
doesn't
indicate
an
intent
to
overrule.
how
did
they
seek
to
distinguish
it?
he
said,
“that
was
treated
by
the
lower
court
as
if
it
were
a
suit
against
a
municipal
corporation,
a
taxpayer's
suit
against
a
municipal
corporation
and
of
course
said
that
we
consider
those
somewhat
similar
to
a
stockholder's
suit
and
therefore
we
accept
it.”
we
have
argued
that
if
that
is
so,
we're
trying
to
doubt
the
validity
of
that
distinction
because
many
--
there's
a
variety
of
reasons
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
but
even
if
that
were
so,
then
this
case
is
exactly
our
old
force
with
bradfield
against
roberts.
bradfield
against
roberts
was
a
suit
not
against
the
municipal
government
of
the
district
of
columbia,
mr.
roberts
was
the
secretary
of
treasury
of
the
united
states.
the
expenditures
which
were
challenged
were
the
building
of
a
hospital
didn't
come
from
taxes
paid
exclusively
by
residents
of
district
of
columbia.
it
was
paid,
came
out
of
the
general
treasury
of
the
united
states,
paid
off
by
120
million
americans
at
that
time.
the
suit
was
defended
not
by
the
corporation
council
of
the
district
of
columbia
but
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
there
was
a
corporation,
a
municipal
corporation
in
sense
of
--
but
they
were
the
instrumentality
by
which
the
money
was
passed
over
to
the
sectarian
institutions.
every
one
of
these
factors
are
present
here.
our
suit
is
against
a
national
official,
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
special
education
not
local.
it's
being
defended
by
the
department
of
justice
not
by
the
corporation
counsel
of
city
of
new
york
and
all
on
respect
it's
entirely
identical.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
just
one
short
addendum
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas
about
the
separation
of
powers.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
this
is
a
–
indeed
it
invoked
the
opening
words
of
the
bill
of
rights,
congress
will
make
no
law
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof.
in
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
i
think
separation
of
powers
argument
is
least
apposite.
i
will
remind,
your
honors,
of
the
classic
statement
in
barnette,
west
virginia
against
barnette
case
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
withdraw
certain
subjects
from
the
vicissitudes
of
political
controversy,
to
place
them
beyond
the
reach
of
the
majorities
and
officials
to
establish
them
as
legal
principles
to
be
applied
by
the
courts.
one's
the
right
for
life,
liberty,
and
property,
free
speech,
a
free
press,
freedom
of
worship
and
assembly
and
other
fundamental
rights
may
not
be
submitted
to
vote;
they
depend
on
the
outcome
of
no
election.
now
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
prior
number
of
cases
after
frothingham
in
which
taxpayer
suits
similar
to
the
present
one
were
accepted
by
this
court.
because
of
lack
of
time
i
will
rely
on
my
brief
rather
than
to
summarize
those
cases.
i
come
now
to
the
--
well,
i
believe
the
major
consideration,
should
the
court
exercise
that
discretion
which
the
constitution
gives
it
in
accepting
or
rejecting
this
similar
case.
initially,
i
want
to
make
one
point
that
should
the
court
decide
to
follow
the
discretion
of
frothingham
and
hold
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can't
sue,
or
the
plaintiffs
--
taxpayers
cannot
sue
in
any
first
amendment
case
on
the
establishment
clause
involving
expense
through
federal
funds
then
there
were
simply
no
way,
none
that
i
know
of,
whereby
a
congressional
act
granting
a
million
dollars
to
a
church,
to
build
a
church
can
be
challenged
in
the
courts.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
solicitor
general's
suggests
a
variety
of
the
--
none
of
which
are
applicable
to
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
for
example
that
the
state
can
conceivably
sue
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
this
law.
but
the
stand
of
new
york
has
taken
the
position
that
this
is
not,
it
has
no
jurisdiction
here.
new
york
had
--
where
this
case
originated,
new
york
has
a
constitutional
provision
specifically
forbidding,
specifically
forbidding
this
type
of
expenditure
which
is
being
carried
on
under
the
federal
act
by
the
commissioner
of
education.
and
an
opinion
which
was
requested
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
have
furnished
the
clerk
of
this
court
the
copy
of
that
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
for
state
department
of
education,
asking
whether
--
the
question
was,
could
the
state
of
new
york
cooperate
whether
the
--
from
the
case
of
a
federal
act
because
of
its
own
constitutional
prohibitions?
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
attorney
for
commissioner
of
education
said,
“yes,
because
this
is
not
state
money.”
the
state
of
new
york
is
merely
acting
as
the
conduit,
merely
acting
as
conduit
to
transfer
the
federal
money
to
the
schools.
now,
the
federal
government
takes
a
position
that
this
is
state
responsibility,
the
state's
exposition
is
that
this
is
the
federal
responsibility.
the
result
is,
nobody
can
challenge.
the
state
of
new
york
says,
“we
have
no
grievance
because
not
a
penny
of
our
money
is
being
involved
here.
now,
there
is
many
reasons
why
the
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
first
and
foremost,
this
is
--
the
issues
in
this
case
are
just
the
type
of
questions
which
a
court
should
have
defied
upon
on
the
day
this
court
was
established
in
1789.
this
is
a
forum
to
determine
the
constitutional
application
of
federal
statutes.
there
is
no
other
forum.
second,
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
the
court,
the
federal
courts
ever
since
the
bill
of
rights
was
written,
it
hasn't
been
pointed
out,
they
definitely
pointed
out,
the
debate
on
having
the
bill
of
rights,
that
the
courts
are
the
peculiar
guardians
of
the
bill
of
rights.
it
is
to
the
courts
which
an
aggrieved
citizen
goes
to,
to
determine
whether
the
bill
of
rights
is
being
adhered
to
or
violated.
this
would
be
the
only
case,
the
only
area
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
would
tie
for
want
of
practical
reasons.
there
is
no
other
part
of
the
the
bill
of
rights,
from
the
first
through
to
the
tenth
amendment
or
the
eight
amendment,
which
isn't
somebody
who
can
go
to
the
courts
and
get
a
judicial
determination,
except
if
frothingham
is
followed
except
this.
for
all
practical
purposes,
this
constitutes,
you
might
almost
say,
a
repeal
of
the
bill
of
establishments
clause
insofar
as
it
concerns
governmental
expenditures.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
have
said,
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
would
object
to
them
nor
do
i
concede
of
any
case.
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
never
has
been
a
case
that
i
know
of
in
which
a
government
would
probably
have
challenged
the
federal
expenditure
under
the
first
amendment.
i've
know
of
no
such
case.
moreover,
if
the
--
this
case
is
barred
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
states
have
done,
at
least
one,
two
other
states
have
followed
the
opinion
of
the
new
york
attorney
general
in
saying
that
they
can
that
those
private
--
that
the
state
can't
act
as
a
conduit
to
transfer
the
money
to
the
private
school
because
as
they
have
no
grievance.
they
have
no
grievance
one
way,
they
are
completely
without
grievance.
if
the
money
can
be
transferred
in
the
deal
--
on
the
type
of
two
the
state
has
very
relatively
minor
part
in
this
act.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they
--
ones
originate
the
plan
as
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
doesn't
have
an
authorized
--
it
authorized
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
time
to
get
around.
you
might
very
well
argue
that
[indiscernible]
has
no
standing.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
presume
massachusetts
know
why
a
suit
brought
in
the
sense
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
on
behalf
of
its
residents.
now,
there
is
one
--
another
factor
which
the
government
has
asserted
in
its
brief
which
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
the
contention
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
very
complex
and
therefore
it's
not
in
--
the
taxpayer's
action
is
not
appropriate
means
of
securing
the
judicial
determination
of
it.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple,
child's
play,
compared
to
those
which
were
involved
in
apportionment
cases.
apportionment
cases
that
involve
congressional
districts,
state
upper
chamber
districts,
state
lower
chamber
districts
under
the
committee
of
municipal
districts,
municipal
apportionment
districts,
each
district,
each
of
these
districts
is
an
island
to
itself
must
be
decided
by
a
court
individually.
yet
the
court
has
taken
ever
since
baker
against
carr,
has
taken
suits
which
are
the
equivalent
of
taxpayers
suit,
a
suit
of
an
individual
citizen.
one
individual
citizen
who
has
relationship
to
the
whole
area
of
representation
is
similar
to
a
taxpayer's
relationship
to
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds.
he
is
in
the
same
concept,
the
same
category
of
de
minimis.
there
is
anything
hardly
more
de
minimis
than
the
value
of
an
individual
citizen
both
in
respect
to,
let's
say,
congressional
representation
which
represents
the
half
the
million
people.
yet
this
court
ever
since
baker
versus
carr
and
even
before
baker
against
carr,
never
had
the
problems
of
that,
never
doubted
that
the
individual
citizens
whose
interest
is
so
minute
nevertheless
has
standing
to
bring
this
suit.
and
as
i
say,
the
issue
there
is
far
more
complex
than
the
issues
here.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
de
minimis
on
which
filing
was
based
has
no
relevancy
under
the
first
amendment
and
it
doesn't
have
under
the
citizenship's
right
to
participate
in
--
select
to
represent
this
government.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
constitution
--
as
far
as
constitutional
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
no,
as
far
as
judicial
discretion
is
concerned,
yes.
this
court
had
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
what
i
am
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
discretion
is
a
broad
sense.
what
i'm
referring
it
to
justice
brandies'
rules
of
self-governance
as
set
forth
in
the
ashwander
against
tva.
he
said
over
the
years,
this
court
has
developed
a
pattern
of
what
case
it
will
take,
what
case
it
will
not
take.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
court
had
a
supervisory
capacity
over
to
this
question
in
the
district
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
this
court
can
very
well
hold
that
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
involved,
the
court's
sound
discretion
is
required
the
acceptance
of
the
suit,
pure
due
process.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
wilson
against
shaw,
the
court
took
jurisdiction
of
the
suit
against
panama
canal?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
--
oh,
i
am
saying
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
i'm
convinced
the
court
has
jurisdiction
even
if
there
were
no
first
amendment
case.
i
do
not
have,
just
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
first
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
as
far
as
[indiscernible]
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
system
is
concerned,
yes.
i
find
nothing
in
the
case
of
this
court
which
is
decided
to
contrary.
i
am
now
yielding
10
minutes
of
my
time
for
senator
ervin
and
i
will
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
first,
a
brief
comment
on
hypothetical
case
of
gardner
against
[indiscernible]
and
how
it's
distinguished
from
the
very
real
case,
flast
against
gardner.
if
the
--
if
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
were
to
bring
this
type
of
suit,
that
the
solicitor
general
referred
to,
the
only
consummation
could
be
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
law
is
or
is
not
constitutional.
that
would
indeed
be
an
advisory
opinion.
now,
perhaps
that
is
a
case
of
controversy
although
that
is
not
100%
certain.
but
flast
against
gardner
does
not
call
for
an
advisory
opinion.
it
calls
for
specific
injunction
against
mr.
gardner,
that's
hardly
is
an
advisory
opinion
and
certainly
is
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
we
ought
to
--
the
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction,
injunctive
relief
or
both.
secondly,
i
think
i
also
ought
to
be
called
the
court's
attention
that
since
this
suit
was
started,
and
since
there's
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
the
issue,
and
the
question,
the
facts
of
governmental
expenditure,
the
expenditure
of
funds
to
finance
the
construction
of
sectarian
schools
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
had
only
in
the
past
two
months,
extended
the
bill
for
another
--
the
law
for
another
three
or
four
years
which
at
this
point
may
very
well
be
held
to
be
a
legislative
acceptance
of
the
department's
determination,
that
indeed
the
act
does
authorize
the
expenditures
which
we
are
challenging
in
this
case,
so
that
they
very
well
be
even
in
that
basis,
in
that
basis
that
the
act
has
now
have
been
in
effect
legislatively
construed
and
therefore
would
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
but
the
thrust,
the
crux
of
our
complaint
is
that
the
whole
act
is
not
unconstitutional.
this
entire
program
is
not
unconstitutional
but
unconstitutional
at
most
is
one
--
two
sets
of
them.
one
of
type
and
one
type
of
two
which
we
say,
we
say
that
at
best
gives
the
administrator
an
option.
you
can
do
--
you
can
enforce
this
one
of
two
ways.
you
can
enforce
it
in
the
way
which
we
suggest
through
giving
these
special
services
in
nonsectarian
auspices,
open
to
all
children
that
would
raise
no
constitutional
issue.
or
you
can
--
you
can
enforce
in
a
different
way
which
does
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
the
administration
has
taken
the
line
of
approach
and
we
assert
that
if
this
is
what
is
authorized
by
the
act,
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it
would
be
completely
impossible.
we'd
have
to
prove,
we
have
to
prove
and
would
be
impossible
to
prove
it.
now,
all
we
can
do
is
in
all
cases
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
as
i
would
say,
we
are
attacking
--
we
are
attacking
the
secretary's
determination,
the
secretary's
determination
that
it
is
constitutional
all
over
the
united
states
to
use
federal
funds
to
finance
the
teaching
in
sectarian
schools.
now
we
prove
our
case
--
we
prove
our
case
especially
(a)
that
that
is
being
done
at
least
in
one
place
and
(b)
that
the
secretary
has
so
approved
it.
this
is
our
case.
now,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
been
done
in
massachusetts,
in
pennsylvania
where
a
similar
suit
is
pending.
the
new
york
times
reported
just
the
other
day
that's
being
done
in
new
jersey
and
certainly
under
the
direction
of
[indiscernible]
and
i'm
certain
its
being
done
in
other
places
as
well.
but
to
get
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court,
we
have
to
establish
at
least
one
place
where
it's
truly,
else
that
it's
truly
an
advisory
opinion
and
no
case
of
controversy.
i
want
to
make
one
more
point
about
the
three-judge
court
and
direct
appeal
here
being
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
it
is.
this
court
has
taken
cases
from
a
one-judge
court
and
bypassed
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
felt
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest,
in
the
national
interest,
it
made
--
this
court
could
very
well
hold.
now
even
if
this
work,
decided
by
judge
frankel
alone,
the
issue
is
of
such
great
significance
required
an
expedition
determination
that
the
court
could
bypass
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
now,
i
want
to
assure
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
case
which
i
put
my
reply
brief
that
bypassing
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
jurisdictional
matter
that
even
if
this
were
not
a
three-judge
court,
even
this
case
had
been
decided
by
one
judge,
it
would
have
been
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
say
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
like
to
believe
that,
but
whenever
that
it's
still
within
the
power
of
the
court,
i
think
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
it
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
the
new
york
state
suit
which
referred
to
(a)
does
not
--
that
raises
–
does
not
raise
title
ii
which
is
raised
in
this
case,
(b)
it
raises
issue
which
are
not
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
case
which
was
taken
in
the
new
york
courts?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that
comes
up
partly
under
this
--
it
partly
comes
up
under
the
statute.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
under
title
ii
but
even
under
title
i.
that
case
allegedly
could
not
apply
with
the
reply
brief.
certain
conduct
which
are
not
authorized
by
the
commissioner
of
education
and
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
for
example,
we
allege
there
that
the
board
of
education
has
allowed
discretion
on
public
school
teachers
to
go
into
the
parochial
schools
and
teach
them
and
be
paid
off
from
the
fund.
this
we
contend
at
all.
it's
authorized
either
by
the
statute
or
by
the
health
--
by
the
secretary's
determination.
how
could
we
bring
such
suit
in
the
federal
court?
we
certainly
would
be
told
you
go
to
the
state
court
and
exhaust
your
state's
remedies.
for
that
reason,
not
for
any
other
reasons
that
that
suit
is
brought
here.
finally,
the
theoretical,
completely
theoretical
idea
that
there
is
a
remedy
elsewhere,
there
isn't.
there
is
no
more
remedy
here
than
there
was
in
baker
against
carr.
baker
against
carr,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
a
dissenting
opinion
he
stated
in
colegrove
against
green
or
you
can
go
to
the
legislature
--
to
state
legislature,
they'll
remedy,
whatever
grievance
you
have,
but
of
course
it
didn't
because
they
have
the
state
in
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo.
every
single
state
has
a
spec
as
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo.
it
warranted
the
federal
court
and
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
let
it
go
with
the
proper
court
and
to
find
the
rationalization
for
it
as
new
york
has
done
by
saying,
“well,
we're
just
a
conduit,
we
don't
really
exercise
determination”
and
therefore
any
grievance
you
have
should
go
to
the
federal
government.
we
have
called
it
the
game
of
[indiscernible]
where
everybody
hit
the
[indiscernible]
to
get
the
ball
to
the
other
side,
because
you're
responsiblity.
now,
between
that
the
constitution
falls
to
the
ground
and
nobody
has
responsibility
for
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
