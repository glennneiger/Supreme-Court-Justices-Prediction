(inaudible)?
what

that
of

which
provides
for
the
division
of

between
you

delineates
the

determine
where
its
boundary
results.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
very
strange
method
for
business
to
be
done.
it
seems
to
me
to
present
us
a
case
here
where
it
said
that
the
two
owned
territory,
if
neither
one
can
point
to
anything,
which
will
show
what
that
division
of

is.

well,
do
we
have
to
determine

from

the

black
they've

black
yes.
justice

that's
right.

black
well,
did
you
all

did
either
one
of
you
offer
any
evidence
to
the
judge
to
show
where
its
division
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
claim
that
the

that
(inaudible)
“the

which
existed
on
the

was
passed”.
justice

black
does
the

the

that
existed

justice

black
do
they
agree

that?
justice

black
to
do
what?
justice

black
is
that
not
a
finding
of
fact
or
--
justice

l.
black
does
this
depend
on
what
congress
intended
in
that
act?
in
your
judgment,
does
this
decision
in
this
case
depend
on
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
that
act
with
reference
to
the
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
we
decide
this
without
a
finding
of

by
the
trial
judge?
you've
got
to
--
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
differs
between
this

to
the

justice

black
but
that
doesn't
determine
where
the

is.
justice

black
now,
(inaudible)
if
it
was.
i
have
--
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
accepting
the
standard
that
what
the
service
that
one
of
them
has
today.
it
has
somehow
surrendered
its
right
to
expand
it
--
justice

black
and
it's
settled
on
that
alternative.
justice
hugo

black
where
is

outside

where

black
the

justice

black
is
that
their

you
have
involved
in
this
case?
justice

black
that's
all
you
have.
justice
hugo

that
depends
that
no

as
to
who
was
giving
the
service
to
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
in
july
the
1st,
19

anybody
else
serving
it?
justice

that's
the

so
neither

justice

what

do
you
have
a

may
i
ask
you
one
more
question

--
on
your

is
it
your
position
that
either
you

that
it's
