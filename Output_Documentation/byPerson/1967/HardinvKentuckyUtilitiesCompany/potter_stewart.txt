justice
potter
stewart
is
that
exhibit
91
blown
up?
justice
potter
stewart
plus
38.
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
oh,
and
there's
exhibit
36
here
also
in
the
--
appended
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
by
the
mayors
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
justice
potter
stewart
but
although
it
purports
to
be
of
the
same
thing,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
also
appended
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
edwards
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
outline
with
your
pointer
there
the
pink
line,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
i
can
see
a
pink
line
from
here.
justice
potter
stewart
obviously,
i
cannot
see
it.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
here
really
isn't
--
the
meaning
of
the
word
primary,
is
it?
it's
the
meaning
of
the
word
area
in
this
legislation.
i
suppose
both
parties
would
agree
that
if
the
area
of
these
two
cities
then
tva
was
not
the
primary
supplier
of
these
two
cities.
and
i
also
suppose
both
parties
or
i
understand
both
parties
would
agree
that
if
the
area
is
the
county,
claiborne
county,
then
tva
is
the
primary
supplier
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
that
county.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
so,
tell
me.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
area
that's
an
issue
here
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
not
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
concept
of
primary.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
the
areas
--
the
two
cities
then
there's
no
question
that
--
what
ku
is
the
primary
supplier
and
tva
was
not,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
way
of
telling
me
that
i'm
right
or
wrong
with
my
understanding
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
telling
us
though
as
i
understand
it,
that
we
must
give
more
deference
to
a
decision
which
is
made
with
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
adversary
proceeding.
we
should
give
more
deference
to
a
decision
that
is
made
in
that
unilateral
in
camera
way
than
we
should
give
to
a
--
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
a
quasi
administrative
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice

justice
