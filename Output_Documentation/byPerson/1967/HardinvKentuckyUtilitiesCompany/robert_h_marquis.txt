mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
by
the
kentucky
utilities
company,
ku,
to
enjoin
the
distribution
of
tva
power
in
tazewell
and
new
tazewell,
two
small
towns
in
claiborne
county
in
northeastern
tennessee.
the
gist
of
the
complaint
is
that
such
distribution
would
violate
section
15d
of
the
tva
act.
that
section
was
added
to
the
act
in
1959,
primarily
to
authorize
tva
to
issue
revenue
bonds
to
help
finance
its
power
program.
it
also
provided
subject
to
certain
exceptions
which
aren't
here
directly
involved.
the
tva
shall
make
no
contracts
for
the
sale
of
power
which
would
result
in
hit
for
its
distributors
becoming
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
july
1st,
1957.
the
tva
board
determined
that
the
tazewell's'
were
within
the
area
thus
described.
the
district
court
after
a
court
--
a
trial
sustained
that
determination
and
indicated
its
own
agreement
with
it.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
tva
board's
determination
was
of
no
consequence
in
making
its
own
independent
determination
to
the
contrary.
there
are
two
issues
presented
here
whether
ku
have
standing
to
sue
and
if
so,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
ignoring
the
tva
board's
determination
in
making
its
own
contrary
determination.
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
if
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
sir,
i
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
including
that
in
my
(voice

--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
might
well
be
true,
yes
sir.
i
should
like
first
to
turn
to
the
facts
out
of
which
this
controversy
arose.
tva
is
a
part
of
this
reasonable
resource
development
program
to
supply
as
lower
cost
power
in
an
area
of
some
80,000
square
miles,
which
is
online
generally
on
this
map.
the
blue
on
this
map
shows
the
tennessee
valley
drainage
basin,
the
area
in
which
power
supply
is
shown
approximately
in
the
pink
area
and
in
that
portion,
the
blue
that
is
inside
the
pink
line.
tva
is
primarily
a
wholesaler
of
power
except
for
supply
to
some
federal
defense
installations
and
a
few
very
large
industries.
it
distributes
its
power
through
some
150
municipalities
and
cooperatives
with
whom
it
has
power
contracts.
now,
claiborne
county,
tennessee
is
shown
on
this
map
as
within
the
area.
it's
just
below
the
point
where
the
tennessee,
kentucky
and
virginia
boundaries
come
together.
and
the
situation
in
claiborne
county
on
the
key
date,
the
key
statutory
date
of
july
1st,
1957
is
shown
on
this

but
that

for
many
years,
the
electric

provided
in
the
county,
it
was
provided
by
those
distribution
lines
coming
from
hillsboro
down
to
and
just
beyond
the
tazewell.
ku
made
no
effort
to
serve
the
rural
areas
of
the
county
and
that
vacuum
was
filled
beginning
in
the
early
1940s
by
two
distributors
of
tva
power,
the
city
of
la
follette
which
is
located
in

and
the
powell

mr.

the

mr.

no

that's
the

made
in
1952,
five

before
this

it
was
a

prepared
by
tva

and
the

is
very
silent
on
the

on
which
it
was

for

now
by
july
1st,
1957,
the
tva
distributors
were
supplying
approximately
two
thirds
of
all
the
customers
in
claiborne
county.
ku
continued
to
supply
about
95%
of
the
customers
in
the
tazewell
themselves
and
in
powell
valley
had
some
customers
in
each
town.
as
the
court
could
see,
powell
valley's
service
lines
completely
surrounded
the
tazewell's
and
penetrated
into
the
towns
at
several
points.
ku's
rates
were
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
is
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
(inaudible)
maps,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
as
i
was
saying,
ku's
rates
were
considerably
higher
than
those
of
the
tva
distributors.
the
towns
located
on
a
depressed
area
were
anxious
to
attract
industry
and
create
jobs
and
they
felt
that
ku's
rates
were
handicapped.
a
representative
of
the
towns
came
to
meet
with
the
tva
board
in
february
of
1960
to
see
if
they
could
obtain
tva
power.
also
present
at
that
meeting
were
representatives
from
middlesborough,
kentucky
located
just
across
the
state
line.
the
tva
board
at
that
time
advised
that
the
tazewells
were
within
the
area
the
tva
could
legally
supply
but
middlesborough
was
not.
that
i
may
say
was
the
first
application
of
the
1959
amendment.
a
little
less
than
six
months
after
the
statute
was
passed
and
the
then
members
of
the
tva
board,
general
(inaudible),
mr.
a.r.
jones
and
mr.
brooks
hayes
had
also
been
directors
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
passed
and
were
thoroughly
with
it
--
familiar
with
it.
so
i
think
that's
a
clear
case
of
contemporaneous
construction.
the
tva
board
also
at
that
time
suggested
that
because
of
their
small
size,
the
tazewells
explore
the
possibility
of
getting
power
through
powell
valley.
now
the
board
had
occasioned
again
to
review
this
matter
in
november
1962
because
tazewell
had
gone
to
powell
valley.
they
had
some
exploratory
meetings
and
powell
valley
wanted
to
be
sure
that
if
it
supplied
power
to
the
towns,
tva
would
continue
to
supply
the
necessary
power
to
powell
valley.
that
was
a
problem
because
that
might
require
tva
to
build
admission
--
additional
transmission
into
the
area
at
a
cost
of
some
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars.
the
board
again
reviewed
the
matter
at
that
time
and
directed
that
powell
valley
be
given
that
necessary
assurance.
after
that,
the
tazewells
attempted
to
buy
the
distribution
lines
of
ku
within
their
limits.
ku
is
not
interested
in
selling.
the
tazewell's
then
decided
to
construct
their
own
duplicating
distribution
system
and
arranged
with
powell
valley
to
supply
them
with
the
power.
some
customers
transferred
from
ku
service
to
the
service
offered
by
the
towns
in
ku
then
brought
this
lawsuit.
again,
in
august
1964,
the
matter
came
before
the
tva
board
because
as
a
result
of
the
lawsuit
and
the
publicity
attending
it,
tva
received
various
inquiries
from
specific
organizations,
from
members
of
congress,
from
distributors
and
individuals
as
to
whether
tva
might
supply
power
in
other
portions
of
claiborne
county.
and
at
that
time,
the
tva
made
a
formal
determination
that
tva
power
might
be
sold
within
all
of
claiborne
county.
now,
i
would
like
next
to
take
up
the
statute
which
the
tva
board
was
called
upon
to
apply.
i
think
this
pink
and
blue
map
is
of
importance
of
that
connection.
not
because
we
think
that
it
exactly
shows
the
boundaries
of
the
area
that
tva
distributors
supply.
we
think
they're
very
approximate
but
it
does
help
to
show
what
the
congress
had
purported.
this
is
one
of
the
three
generally
similar
maps
which
were
purported
to
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
the
tva
bond
legislation.
that
consideration
incidentally
extended
from
1955
to
1959.
and
i
think
this
map
tends
to
show
that
what
congress
was
thinking
of
was
a
solid
expanse,
a
solid
area
which
might
be
imposed
within
a
periphery
or
a
perimeter.
congress
knew
incidentally
that
there
were
islands.
senate
committee
report
shows
that
clearly
the
private
power
service
inside
the
pink
line.
we
think
that
the
statutory
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
it
starts
right
here
going
over
here
and
then
to
this.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
but
i
hope
it
is.
now,
we
think
that
the
area
for
which
the
primary
source
of
power,
tva
or
its
distributors
with
primary
source
of
power
supply
includes
everything
within
that
pink
line.
ku's
contention
is
that
areas
of
private
power
service
and
indeed,
i
think
any
private
power
customer
are
excluded.
now
the
statute
as
we
see
it
describes
three
areas.
the
first
two
are
included
in
the
first
provision
--
the
first
sentence
of
the
territorial
limitation
in
section
15d
(a)
and
they're
described
as
the
area
for
which
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
in
july
1st,
1957.
and
we
think
as
i
indicated
that
that
meant
an
area
within
which
there
were
some
prior
--
some
power
supply
by
others
that
in
which
we
were
the
chief
supplier.
then
next,
such
additional
area,
extending
not
more
than
five
miles
around
the
periphery
of
such
area,
that
is
the
primary
area
as
maybe
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
the
corporation
and
its
distributors
within
the
said
area
and
we
think
that
by
that,
the
congress
meant
a
five-mile
belt
extending
around
the
periphery.
the
act
contains
no
limitations
on
tva
service
within
the
primary
area.
it
contains
certain
limitations
and
service
within
the
peripheral
area.
one
of
which
is
that
we
may
not
serve
within
a
municipality
which
is
receiving
power
from
another
source
on
or
after
july
1st,
1957.
then
the
act
speaks
of
what
we
think
is
a
third
area
and
that
is
described
in
these
terms.
nothing
in
this
subsections,
subsection
(a)
of
15d,
shall
prevent
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
from
supplying
electric
power
to
any
customer
within
any
area
in
which
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
had
generally
established
electric
service
on
july
1st,
1957
into
which,
electric
service
was
not
being
supplied
from
any
other
source
on
the
effective
date
of
this
act
which
is
august
6,
1959.
that
we
think
is
a
catchall,
an
insurance
kind
of
provision.
congress
knew
for
example
that
we
were
serving
an
ac
complex
delivering
huge
quantities
of
power
to
it
up
here
in
kentucky
where
we
moved
from
that
pink
area.
they
were
serving
customer
in
tarrant
city,
alabama
down
here.
there
were
possibilities
that
perhaps
the
distributor
lines
existing
on
july
1st,
1957
might
have
been
extended
outside
the
57
peripheral
areas
between
57
and
59.
we
think
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
section
where
it
was
designed
to
take
care
of
and
we
also
do
not
believe
that
it
can
possibly
be
read
as
i
think
ku
raised
it
as
a
limitation
on
the
first
two
areas
since
it
begins,
nothing
shall
prevent.
we
don't
think
that
that
can
be
read
dramatically
as
a
limitation.
now
ku
also
relies
on
legislative
history.
we
think
that
reliance
is
erroneous.
the
bill
which
became
section
15d
was
past
first
by
the
house.
and
as
so
passed,
it
included
an
amendment
offered
by
representative
benson
which
would
have
prevented
with
the
exception
of
service
to
certain
named
towns
the
supplying
of
power
outside
the
service
area
of
the
corporation
has
existed
on
july
1st,
1957.
now
when
the
bill
went
over
to
the
senate
and
got
before
the
senate
public
works
committee,
there
is
obviously
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
respect
to
the
term
“service
area”.
one
reason
being
that
at
that
time
the
only
limitation
on
tva's
supplying
of
power
was
that
it
had
to
be
within
economic
transmission
distance
of
a
tva
dam
on
the
tennessee
river.
that
obviously
was
not
a
very
specific
limitation
and
it
was
one
which
is
subject
to
change
with
technological
change
and
with
economic
change.
some
members
of
the
senate
committee,
senator
kerr
for
one
as
he
said
the
floor,
interpreted
service
area
to
include
everything
that
we
might
then
supply
as
being
within
economic
transmission
distance.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
senator
kerr
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
subcommittee
has
considered
the
bill
your
honor.
then
other
members
obviously
thought
it
was
so
much
a
narrower
provision.
it
would
appear
that
congressman
benson
himself
may
have
intended
it
as
a
narrower
provision.
but
in
any
event,
the
senate
committee
decided,
so
they
said
in
their
report
that
it
was
a
nebulous
term
difficult
to
define
and
it's
substituted
the
term
area
for
which
tva
was
the
primary
source
of
power
supply.
now
i
don't
think
if
there's
any
question
about
what
the
senate
committee
meant
when
it
used
that
term.
it's
said
expressly
that
that
term
meant
the
area
in
which
tva
was
the
chief
or
principal
supplier
of
power
on
july
1st,
1957.
it
also
said
that
while
its
version
of
the
bill
which
would
have
permitted
us
to
serve
everything
within
the
area
for
which
we
were
the
sort
--
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
plus
an
additional
2000
square
miles
or
2.5%.
it
said
that
that
version
would
permit
elasticity
and
adjustments,
adjustments
on
the
periphery
of
the
area
presently
supplied
and
within
that
area.
it
made
pretty
clear
what
kind
of
adjustments
to
have
in
mind.
it
said,
within
the
general
area
receiving
tva
power,
there
are
small
areas
served
by
a
private
power
entirely
surrounded
by
the
lines
of
tva
distributors.
there
are
also
many
areas
in
which
the
lines
of
tv
--
of
distributors
of
tva
power
and
the
lines
of
private
power
companies
were
interlaced.
and
we
think
that
describes
the
situation
in
and
around
the
tazewells
as
well
as
any
can
possibly
could.
now
ku
says
that
the
senate
committee
report
is
irrelevant
because
after
the
bill
was
reported
out,
there
was
adopted
what
was
one
small
change
was
the
final
version
of
the
bill,
an
amendment
cosponsored
by
senator
randolph,
the
randolph
amendment.
ku
says
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
amendment
was
in
effect
a
return
to
the
house
version
of
the
bill
considered
in
a
stricter
sense.
well,
we
just
believe
that
that
is
erroneous.
it
certainly
wasn't
for
one
thing.
it
included
the
five-mile
belt
which
the
house
bill
certainly
didn't.
it
included
the
third
area
which
i
mentioned
which
the
house
bill
certainly
didn't
but
most
importantly,
it
retained
the
language
area
for
which
tva
was
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
after
the
senate
committee
had
made
perfectly
clear
what
it
meant
by
that
language.
and
the
senate
committee's
explanation
incidentally
of
course
accords
fully
with
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
term
“primary”.
primary
means
first
in
rank
or
importance,
chief
or
principal
which
is
just
what
the
senate
committee
said
it
meant.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
the
question
is,
the
area
for
which
we
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
which
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
but
the
term
primary
describes
the
term
area.
the
area
that
we're
dealing
with
is
the
one
for
which
we're
the
primary
source
of
power
supply.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
the
an
--
the
question
your
honor
is
whether
the
area
in
effect
includes
something
approximating
everything
within
the
pink
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
or
whether
utility
islands
within
that
pink
line
are
excluded.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
think
you're
right
your
honor.
now
the
randolph
amendment,
we
think
also
designed
from
the
use
of
the
statutory
language
as
the
senate
committee
had
explained
with
the
elasticity
and
adjustment
both
on
the
periphery
and
within
the
periphery,
the
randolph
amendment
did
not
change
that
basic
concept.
also,
senator
randolph
had
made
very
clear
in
his
supplementary
reviews
to
the
senate
report
what
his
problem
was
with
the
senate
committee
version
of
the
bill.
that
version
as
i
said
permitted
this
to
supply
an
additional
2000
miles
without
limiting
it
to
anything
necessarily
contiguous
to
the
primary
area.
and
he
was
afraid
that
we
might
run
a
narrow
corridor
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
miles
and
with
a
long
distance
away
perhaps
as
he
put
it
even
getting
up
to
his
homestead
of
west
virginia.
the
final
version
keeps
the
2000
mile
limitation
on
the
peripheral
area
but
it
limits
it
to
the
five-mile
belt.
now
ku
also
relies
on
some
subsequent
legislative
history.
in
1966,
which
we
think
directly
contradicts
its
theory,
the
original
59
legislation
that
authorizes
to
issue
bonds
in
the
total
amount
of
$750
million.
the
1966
legislation
increased
that
to
$1,750,000,000.
at
the
time
that
legislation
was
before
the
senate
public
works
committee,
the
jackson
purchase
world
electric
cooperative
appears
before
the
committee
and
asked
to
be
specifically
--
asked
that
it
be
named
specifically
in
the
legislation
so
that
tva
could
serve
it.
jackson
purchase
served
an
area
up
here
in
the
extreme
portion
of
northwestern
kentucky.
it
was
a
customer
of
ku.
it
had
come
to
tva
and
asked
that
we
serve
it.
the
tva
board
had
determined
in
that
case
that
we
could
not
legally
supply
it
under
the
terms
of
the
1959
amendment
and
jackson
purchase
there
upon
filed
suit
against
this
for
mandatory
injunction
as
a
preference
customer
to
seek
an
order
requiring
that
we
serve
it.
that
suit
was
pending
at
the
time
of
the
1966
hearing.
the
senate
committee
denied
jackson
purchase's
request
and
in
doing
so,
it
discussed
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
adopted
in
1959.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
randolph
submitted
the
report
for
the
senate
committee.
he
was
now
a
chairman
both
of
the
senate
public
works
committee
and
of
the
flight
control
subcommittee
which
considered
that
legislation.
and
that
senate
committee
report
speaks
just
as
did
the
59
report.
it
says,
the
act
permits
an
increase
in
such
area
of
2.5%
or
2000
square
miles
which
ever
is
the
lesser
or
of
which
tva
was
the
chief
or
principal
supplier
of
power
in
july
1st,
1957.
and
then
it
indicated
its
understanding
of
what
it
meant
by
the
legislation.
it
goes
back
and
actually
quotes
from
the
1959
senate
committee
report.
on
page
57
of
ku's
brief,
they
quote
a
portion
of
the
59
senate
committee
report
and
say
that
the
senate
--
that
the
randolph
amendment
was
a
departure
from
it.
well
now
here
on
66,
along
comes
the
senate
committee
and
quotes
from
the
very
paragraph
of
that
report
to
which
they
refer
on
page
57
of
their
brief,
saying
in
part,
it,
the
legislation
will
permit
desirable
minor
adjustments
on
the
periphery
of
the
area
presently
supplied
and
within
that
area.
now,
i
think
if
it's
once
recognized
that
the
primary
area
is
that
area
for
which
we
were
the
chief
source
of
power
supply,
not
the
sole
source
of
power
supply
and
may
include
some
private
utility
customers
then
there
is
considerable
discretion
as
to
how
that
primary
area
shall
be
drawn.
the
tva
board's
interpretation
of
this
was
that
the
act
indicated
that
they
should
draw
stable
boundaries,
boundaries
within
the
area,
the
utilities,
tva,
and
the
people
could
live
with,
and
we
think
that
is
correct.
we
also
think
that
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
proper
in
that
situation
to
include
the
tazewells
as
within
the
area.
in
fact,
we
think
it
had
been
--
would
have
been
most
unreasonable
to
exclude
them.
the
determination
made
by
the
board
i
think
was
a
mixed
one
of
law
and
fact.
the
legal
part
was
that
as
i
have
said,
the
area
was
a
single
area
with
a
perimeter
around
it
and
with
some
private
utility
--
islands
of
private
utility
service
inside.
the
back
portion
of
it
was
that
the
tazewells
were
inside
the
periphery.
this
was
an
executive
determination.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
act
for
notice
for
hearings
and
the
thing
of
the
--
things
normally
associated
with
adjudicatory
process.
it
was
an
executive
or
management
determination
incident
to
the
sale
of
property
in
this
case,
tva
power
and
contracting
for
the
sale
of
that
power.
even
in
the
case
of
quasi
judicial
agencies,
i
think
this
court
has
gone
a
long
way
in
deferring
to
the
construction,
contemporaneous
construction
of
statutory
terms
by
such
agencies.
and
of
course
it
upholds
their
fact
determinations
where
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
support.
i
think
that
the
scope
of
judicial
review
in
the
case
of
an
executive
determination
is
narrow.
i
think
the
principle
has
been
--
then
accepted
ever
since
(inaudible)
against
paul
then
the
case
of
such
a
determination
unless
the
act
is
in
effect
a
ministerial
act,
the
court
will
not
substitute
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
executive
agency
either
as
to
the
law,
if
there's
any
question
about
its
meaning,
or
the
facts
unless
the
executive
agency
is
just
going
clear
(inaudible).
now
certainly,
the
tva
board's
determination
both
of
law
in
fact
in
this
case
can
hardly
be
unreasonable
where
a
long
experienced
district
judge
after
a
four-day
trial,
indicates
that
he
agrees
independently
both
with
the
interpretation
of
law
and
the
interpretation
of
the
facts.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor,
we
do
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
because
we
think
the
rule
has
always
been
that
where
you
have
an
executive
determination,
one
that
is
not
associated
with
adjudication,
a
situation
where
the
executive
is
called
upon
in
performing
its
normal
duties
to
look
at
the
statutes
under
which
it
acts
and
act
accordingly
that
you
have
there
a
question
of
executive
discretion.
and
unless
you
have
a
ministerial
act
situation,
the
court's
have
not
historically
intervened
to
either
a
mandamus
or
injunction.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
it
certainly
couldn't
be
rule
making,
your
honor,
because
the
administrative
procedure
act
expressly
excludes
anything
having
to
do
with
property
or
contracts
from
rulemaking.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
yes,
it
is
that.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct
and
that's
what
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
administrative
procedure
act
provides
for.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
not
practically
immune.
if
for
example,
the
court
should
think
that
the
law
is
absolutely
and
completely
clear
against
the
agency's
construction
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
matter
then
you
have
a
ministerial
situation
and
a
mandamus
or
injunction
would
lie.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
i'm
about
to
get
to
that
right
now.
that
of
course
is
the
threshold
question.
and
i
think
the
factors
there
that
are
of
primary
importance
are
first,
that
ku
has
no
exclusive
franchise
to
serve
in
claiborne
county.
it's
a
non-exclusive
franchise.
and
second,
that
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
under
tennessee
law
are
entitled
to
compete.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
act
expressly
gives
municipality
such
authority.
now,
ku's
theory
here
is
that
the
competition
is
illegible
not
because
the
towns
had
no
right
to
compete
but
because
tva
was
unlawfully
supplying
power
ot
them.
we
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
their
situation
from
alabama
power
company
against
ickes.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
challenged
loan
--
there
were
challenged
loans
and
grants
by
the
emergency
administrator
of
public
works
for
the
purpose
of
financing
municipal
construction
of
electric
distribution
systems.
and
this
court
said
that
the
utility
company
could
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
federal
action,
loan
some
grants
which
made
possible
competition
which
in
itself
was
legal.
here,
tva
is
not
furnishing
loan
to
grants,
its
furnishing
power
and
we
think
the
basic
situation
is
the
same.
also,
we
think
that
the
duty
here
that
tva
owes,
is
a
duty
not
owed
to
any
private
party
but
a
duty
owed
to
the
government.
we
think
that
congress
reserved
to
itself
the
authority
to
determine
whether
the
tva
board
was
doing
its
duty
in
applying
the
statute
and
itself
giving
adequate
protection
of
utilities
as
of
course
we
did
in
the
case
of
middlesborough
and
in
the
case
of
jackson
purchase.
and
in
that
connection
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
read
briefly
from
the
senate
committee
report.
i
seem
not
to
have
it
your
honors
but
what
they
said
in
that
case
was
that
nothing
in
this
act
would
change
the
basic
relationship
between
congress
and
tva
that
tva
would
be
held
as
it
always
has
been
accountable
for
results.
it
would
have
to
come
before
congress
each
year
in
connection
with
its
appropriations
for
its
other
programs
at
which
time
its
power
program
could
also
be
reviewed.
and
it
said
that
it
in
effect
would
rely
upon
the
tva
board
to
carry
out
faithfully
the
duties
entrusted
to
it.
i
would
now
like
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
deal
to
mr.
stanifer
and
to
reserve
the
balance
of
what
time
we
have
after
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
i
first
want
to
deal
with
this
question
of
specific
municipalities
because
there
is
in
the
statute
15d
an
expressed
provision
relating
to
them.
and
it
starts
again
with
the
language
nothing
shall
prevent
service
to
certain
named
municipalities.
now
the
way
that
got
into
the
legislation
was
this.
those
--
most
of
those
were
added
in
the
house
at
a
time
when
it
adopted
the
benson
amendment
with
its
service
area
limitation.
when
the
matter
came
before
the
senate
committee,
other
municipalities
appeared
with
their
congressman,
their
senators
and
i
think
just
about
everybody
who
asked
for
such
a
specific
exception
got
one.
now,
the
senate
committee
reported
out
its
version
of
the
bill
with
those
exceptions
still
there.
and
it
was
logical
that
they
should
because
there
is
no
assurance
of
that
time
what
final
--
what
form
the
bill
was
going
to
take.
should
it
for
example
go
to
conference?
it
is
logical
therefore
to
preserve
those
exceptions.
further,
if
i
understand
ku's
brief
correctly,
it
admits
that
the
senate
committee
version
of
the
bill
would
permit
us
to
exercise
the
discretion
that
we
have
exercised
and
to
serve
the
tazewells.
well,
all
of
those
exceptions
were
included
in
the
bills
as
were
reported
out
by
the
senate
committee.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
the
right
to
determine
the
periphery
of
that
area
for
which
we
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply,
the
chief
supplier
or
the
principal
supplier.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no
sir
but
i
think
we
were
in
cumberland
county
as
a
whole
and
i
think
that
the
tazewells
were
islands
inside
that
primary
area.
now
with
reference
to
these
maps,
we
did
prepare
as
mr.
marshall
said,
a
number
of
maps.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
them,
you
will
see
that
they
are
virtually
artist's
renderings.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
presented
here.
and
they
just
didn't
take
into
account
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
if
we
are
going
like
--
by
something
like
that,
i
might
in
reply
say
that
before
the
house
committee,
ku
presented
a
map.
its
sheet
8(b)
of
exhibit
volume
1
and
it
shows
the
tazewells
within
what
they
call
the
tva
service
area.
i
don't
think
that
the
situation
can
be
decided
by
maps
that
were
not
prepared
without
reference
to
the
question
at
hand.
the
only
such
map
as
exhibit
91
and
the
accuracy
of
that
has
nowhere
been
challenged.
now
they
talk
about
the
roe-osborn
map.
that
map
was
prepared
in
1960
by
two
local
managers
of
ku
and
powell
valley
respectively.
it
was
never
accepted
by
the
powell
valley
cooperative.
in
fact,
when
ku
presented
ku
with
the
1961
proposed
agreement
which
called
for
a
territory
agreement
based
on
those
maps,
powell
valley
refused
to
accept
it.
moreover,
on
that
roe-osborn
map
if
the
court
will
examine
it
and
it
is
number
14.
that
map
itself
shows
that
there
is
a
separation
between
what
ku
claims
are
two
of
its
areas
of
service.
that
separation
occurs
right
here
where
the
line
of
powell
valley
crosses,
so
that
their,
it
seems
to
me
under
any
theory
of
the
case,
we
incidentally
had
a
large
blow
off
of
that
so
that
the
court
could
see
it
more
clearly
and
we
outlined
in
pink
so
that
it
could
and
you
will
notice
that
there
is
a
separation
just
at
that
point
between
their
so-called
corridors
so
that
under
area
(inaudible).
this
is
an
island
inside
the
tva
periphery
whether
it's
drawn
there
or
whether
it's
drawn
where
we
finally
drew
up
here
at
the
state
line.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
exactly
correct
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
adjustment
within
the
periphery
that
the
senate
committee
spoke
of.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
our
rates
are
lower
than
theirs.
that
of
course
is
where
the
towns
would
prefer
to
have
tva
power.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
those
islands?
probably
so,
quite
possible.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
for
an
electrically
heated
home
of
average
size,
their
rates
were
two
and
a
half
times
as
high.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
because
your
honor,
they
spoke
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
it
that
they
intended
that
there
be
adjustments
around
the
periphery
and
within
the
periphery.
now
the
only
kind
of
adjustments
they
could
possibly
mean
were
a
transfer
of
one
kind
of
service
to
another.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
read
this
language
from
the
senate
report.
within
the
general
area
receiving
tva
power,
there
are
small
areas
served
by
private
power
entirely
surrounded
by
the
lines
of
tva
distributors.
that
is
the
exact
situation
here
in
the
tazewell.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
because
it
explained,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
the
kind
of
adjustments
within
the
periphery
of
our
area
that
they
anticipated
would
take
place
and
should
take
place.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
inside
the
periphery.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
what
size?
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
periphery
is
a
more
accurately
drawn
--
of
line
around
our
--
the
area
in
which
we
are
the
chief
supplier
and
that
would
approximate
the
line
on
that
big
map
although
it
is
exactly
accurate.
there
was
reference
to
this,
senator
randolph
himself
who
proposed
the
amendment
that
finally
became
law,
said
in
the
very
last
part
of
his
supplemental
views
of
course
consistent
with
this
view,
and
the
view
he's
talking
about
is
that
we
ought
to
be
more
limited
in
the
peripheral
area.
of
course,
consistent
with
this
view,
tva
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
any
islands
which
now
exist
within
its
geographical
operating
area
as
it
existed
on
july
1st,
1957.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
senator
randolph,
your
honor,
and
he
proposed
the
amendment
on
the
senate
floor,
it
was
finally
adopted.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
this
area?
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
i
don't
concede
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
anyway
to
protect
the
islands
within
our
perimeter.
now
it
was
to
afford
though
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
the
--
they
were
to
be
protected
by
confining
tva
service
within
the
periphery
of
the
primary
area
plus
the
five-mile
belt
around
it
plus
the
third
area
i
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
in
any
particular
towns
that
might
be
involved.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
oh,
surely
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
it's
protected
middlesborough.
the
tva
board
decided
it
couldn't
serve
it.
they're
protected
over
here
as
to
jackson
purchase
when
the
tva
board
decided
it
couldn't
serve
it
and
where
we
were
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
precisely.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
exactly
correct
your
honor.
but
its
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not.
the
tva
board
finally
drew
the
line
of
the
state
line.
so,
no
earthly
way
to
draw
any
corridor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
we
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
we
would
contend
your
honor
that
the
five-miles
would
take
in
everything
except
for
the
town
of
cumberland
gap.
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no,
not
tazewell
for
the
reason
of
the
five
miles.
we
think
the
five
--
that
tazewell
has
to
be
inside
the
perimeter
when
it's
drawn
up
here,
here,
or
here.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
five-mile
peripheral
area
does
not
permit
us
to
serve
within
municipalities.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
we
read
differently
than
does
mr.
marshall,
this
business
about
distributors
within
the
area.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
will
simply
say
that
i
think
that's
just
a
descriptive
word.
it
started
out
communities
in
the
area
and
the
congress
deliberately
changed
it
to
tva
and
its
distributors
including
cooperatives,
so
i
don't
think
it
can
possibly
have
the
meaning
that
he
ascribes
to
it.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
mention
judge
--
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
of
the
district
court's
findings.
the
district
court
had
done
a
judgment
which
it
said
included
its
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
within
the
course
of
the
--
four
corners
of
the
opinion.
and
judge
taylor
in
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes.
yes
your
honor.
and
one
thing
that
judge
taylor
said
was
maps
show
that
the
lines
of
powell
valley
crossed
the
lines
of
ku
at
one
point
in
the
so-called
corridor.
he
also
said
the
finding
of
the
board,
tva
board,
was
made
in
good
faith
and
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
on
the
discretion
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
said
to
tva,
one,
before
this
act
was
passed,
you
must
serve
a
preference
customer
if
you
legally
can
serve.
those
are
that
--
that
provision
is
in
section
10
and
section
12
of
the
tva
act.
then
it
said
to
us
here,
confine
yourself
within
the
periphery
of
the
area
for
which
you
are
the
primary,
the
chief,
or
principal
supplier
plus
the
peripheral
area
and
so
on.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
such
circumstances
when
a
preference
customer
comes
to
us
whether
it's
the
tazewells,
whether
it's
middlesborough,
whether
it's
jackson
purchase,
that
the
tva
board
must
make
a
determination
one
way
or
the
other.
it's
his
job.
it's
got
to
do
it
in
carrying
on
its
functions
under
the
tva
act.
now
mr.
marshall
indicated
that
no
determination
was
made
until
1964.
well,
certainly,
the
tazewells
were
told
in
1960
that
they
could
be
served.
and
in
1962,
the
tva
board
certainly
made
a
determination
when
it
constructed
tva
staff
to
give
powell
valley
assurance
that
tva
would
supply
the
necessary
power
to
serve
the
tazewells
even
though
that
might
mean
tva
is
spending
$750,000
for
additional
transmission.
now,
i
found
incidentally
in
connection
with
that
discretion
point,
the
paragraphs
that
i
was
looking
for
in
the
senate
committee
report.
i
have
only
a
minute
in
the
relation
of
the
standard.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
indicate
that
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
ride
a
herd
so
to
speak
on
the
tva
board,
and
that
our
duty
was
owed
to
the
government,
not
the
private
litigants.
the
committee
said
--
the
committee
believes
that
the
tva
board
would
not
be
reckless
in
utilizing
the
authority
to
provide
additional
service
which
actually
amounts
to
less
than
one
mile
around
the
periphery
or
the
present
area
in
which
tva
power
is
used.
it
were
properly
used
such
authority
to
supply
isolated
communities
from
contiguous
areas
extension
to
rural
areas
and
expanded
municipal
areas,
and
minor
and
necessary
adjustments
around
the
periphery
and
within
the
area
in
which
power
is
now
supplied.
hr3460
where
the
amendments
proposed
by
the
committee
does
not
change
the
basic
administrative
premise
of
the
tva
act.
the
tva
board
will
continue
to
be
held
fully
responsible
by
the
congress
for
the
results
of
its
operations
and
will
have
corresponding
administrative
authority
in
the
discharge
of
this
responsibility.
the
actions
of
the
board
will
be
subject
to
annual
review
by
the
congress.
and
of
course
they're
also
subject
every
five
years
because
congress
gives
us
an
increase
in
bond
authorization
that
will
last
for
about
that
period
of
time
and
then
we
have
to
come
back.
under
those
circumstances,
it's
our
position
as
i
indicated
in
perkins
against
lukens
steel,
i
think
is
the
case
closest
to
it
that
the
duty
owed
by
tva
is
due
to
the
government,
is
owed
to
the
government
and
not
to
private
litigants
and
that
there
was
no
intention
to
confer
a
standing.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
by
the
kentucky
utilities
company,
ku,
to
enjoin
the
distribution
of
tva
power
in
tazewell
and
new
tazewell,
two
small
towns
in
claiborne
county
in
northeastern
tennessee.
the
gist
of
the
complaint
is
that
such
distribution
would
violate
section
15d
of
the
tva
act.
that
section
was
added
to
the
act
in
1959,
primarily
to
authorize
tva
to
issue
revenue
bonds
to
help
finance
its
power
program.
it
also
provided
subject
to
certain
exceptions
which
aren't
here
directly
involved.
the
tva
shall
make
no
contracts
for
the
sale
of
power
which
would
result
in
hit
for
its
distributors
becoming
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
july
1st,
1957.
the
tva
board
determined
that
the
tazewell's'
were
within
the
area
thus
described.
the
district
court
after
a
court
--
a
trial
sustained
that
determination
and
indicated
its
own
agreement
with
it.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
tva
board's
determination
was
of
no
consequence
in
making
its
own
independent
determination
to
the
contrary.
there
are
two
issues
presented
here
whether
ku
have
standing
to
sue
and
if
so,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
ignoring
the
tva
board's
determination
in
making
its
own
contrary
determination.
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
if
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
sir,
i
was
--
mr.
robert

including
that
in
my

--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
might
well
be
true,
yes
sir.
i
should
like
first
to
turn
to
the
facts
out
of
which
this
controversy
arose.
tva
is
a
part
of
this
reasonable
resource
development
program
to
supply
as
lower
cost
power
in
an
area
of
some
80,000
square
miles,
which
is
online
generally
on
this
map.
the
blue
on
this
map
shows
the
tennessee
valley
drainage
basin,
the
area
in
which
power
supply
is
shown
approximately
in
the
pink
area
and
in
that
portion,
the
blue
that
is
inside
the
pink
line.
tva
is
primarily
a
wholesaler
of
power
except
for
supply
to
some
federal
defense
installations
and
a
few
very
large
industries.
it
distributes
its
power
through
some
150
municipalities
and
cooperatives
with
whom
it
has
power
contracts.
now,
claiborne
county,
tennessee
is
shown
on
this
map
as
within
the
area.
it's
just
below
the
point
where
the
tennessee,
kentucky
and
virginia
boundaries
come
together.
and
the
situation
in
claiborne
county
on
the
key
date,
the
key
statutory

of
july

1957
is

but
that

it
--
distribution

are
shown
in

for
many
years,
the
electric
service
provided
in
the
county,
it
was
provided
by
those
distribution
lines
coming
from
hillsboro
down
to
and
just
beyond
the
tazewell.
ku
made
no
effort
to
serve
the
rural
areas
of
the
county
and
that
vacuum
was
filled
beginning
in
the
early
1940s
by
two
distributors
of
tva
power,
the
city
of
la
follette
which
is
located
in

and
the
powell

mr.

the

mr.

oh,
that's
a

yes

mr.
robert

no
sir,
that's
the
map
made
in
1952,
five
years
before
this
key
date.
it
was
a
map
prepared
by
tva
engineer
and
the
record
is
very
silent
on
the
basis
on
which
it
was
prepared
for
what
he
considered.
mr.

and

which

of

number

now
by
july
1st,
1957,
the
tva
distributors
were
supplying
approximately
two
thirds
of
all
the
customers
in
claiborne
county.
ku
continued
to
supply
about
95%
of
the
customers
in
the
tazewell
themselves
and
in
powell
valley
had
some
customers
in
each
town.
as
the
court
could
see,
powell
valley's
service
lines
completely
surrounded
the
tazewell's
and
penetrated
into
the
towns
at
several
points.
ku's
rates
were
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
is
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
(inaudible)
maps,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
as
i
was
saying,
ku's
rates
were
considerably
higher
than
those
of
the
tva
distributors.
the
towns
located
on
a
depressed
area
were
anxious
to
attract
industry
and
create
jobs
and
they
felt
that
ku's
rates
were
handicapped.
a
representative
of
the
towns
came
to
meet
with
the
tva
board
in
february
of
1960
to
see
if
they
could
obtain
tva
power.
also
present
at
that
meeting
were
representatives
from
middlesborough,
kentucky
located
just
across
the
state
line.
the
tva
board
at
that
time
advised
that
the
tazewells
were
within
the
area
the
tva
could
legally
supply
but
middlesborough
was
not.
that
i
may
say
was
the
first
application
of
the
1959
amendment.
a
little
less
than
six
months
after
the
statute
was
passed
and
the
then
members
of
the
tva
board,
general
(inaudible),
mr.
a.r.
jones
and
mr.
brooks
hayes
had
also
been
directors
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
passed
and
were
thoroughly
with
it
--
familiar
with
it.
so
i
think
that's
a
clear
case
of
contemporaneous
construction.
the
tva
board
also
at
that
time
suggested
that
because
of
their
small
size,
the
tazewells
explore
the
possibility
of
getting
power
through
powell
valley.
now
the
board
had
occasioned
again
to
review
this
matter
in
november
1962
because
tazewell
had
gone
to
powell
valley.
they
had
some
exploratory
meetings
and
powell
valley
wanted
to
be
sure
that
if
it
supplied
power
to
the
towns,
tva
would
continue
to
supply
the
necessary
power
to
powell
valley.
that
was
a
problem
because
that
might
require
tva
to
build
admission
--
additional
transmission
into
the
area
at
a
cost
of
some
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars.
the
board
again
reviewed
the
matter
at
that
time
and
directed
that
powell
valley
be
given
that
necessary
assurance.
after
that,
the
tazewells
attempted
to
buy
the
distribution
lines
of
ku
within
their
limits.
ku
is
not
interested
in
selling.
the
tazewell's
then
decided
to
construct
their
own
duplicating
distribution
system
and
arranged
with
powell
valley
to
supply
them
with
the
power.
some
customers
transferred
from
ku
service
to
the
service
offered
by
the
towns
in
ku
then
brought
this
lawsuit.
again,
in
august
1964,
the
matter
came
before
the
tva
board
because
as
a
result
of
the
lawsuit
and
the
publicity
attending
it,
tva
received
various
inquiries
from
specific
organizations,
from
members
of
congress,
from
distributors
and
individuals
as
to
whether
tva
might
supply
power
in
other
portions
of
claiborne
county.
and
at
that
time,
the
tva
made
a
formal
determination
that
tva
power
might
be
sold
within
all
of
claiborne
county.
now,
i
would
like
next
to
take
up
the
statute
which
the
tva
board
was
called
upon
to
apply.
i
think
this
pink
and
blue
map
is
of
importance
of
that
connection.
not
because
we
think
that
it
exactly
shows
the
boundaries
of
the
area
that
tva
distributors
supply.
we
think
they're
very
approximate
but
it
does
help
to
show
what
the
congress
had
purported.
this
is
one
of
the
three
generally
similar
maps
which
were
purported
to
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
the
tva
bond
legislation.
that
consideration
incidentally
extended
from
1955
to
1959.
and
i
think
this
map
tends
to
show
that
what
congress
was
thinking
of
was
a
solid
expanse,
a
solid
area
which
might
be
imposed
within
a
periphery
or
a
perimeter.
congress
knew
incidentally
that
there
were
islands.
senate
committee
report
shows
that
clearly
the
private
power
service
inside
the
pink
line.
we
think
that
the
statutory
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
it
starts
right
here
going
over
here
and
then
to
this.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
but
i
hope
it
is.
now,
we
think
that
the
area
for
which
the
primary
source
of
power,
tva
or
its
distributors
with
primary
source
of
power
supply
includes
everything
within
that
pink
line.
ku's
contention
is
that
areas
of
private
power
service
and
indeed,
i
think
any
private
power
customer
are
excluded.
now
the
statute
as
we
see
it
describes
three
areas.
the
first
two
are
included
in
the
first
provision
--
the
first
sentence
of
the
territorial
limitation
in
section
15d
(a)
and
they're
described
as
the
area
for
which
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
in
july
1st,
1957.
and
we
think
as
i
indicated
that
that
meant
an
area
within
which
there
were
some
prior
--
some
power
supply
by
others
that
in
which
we
were
the
chief
supplier.
then
next,
such
additional
area,
extending
not
more
than
five
miles
around
the
periphery
of
such
area,
that
is
the
primary
area
as
maybe
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
the
corporation
and
its
distributors
within
the
said
area
and
we
think
that
by
that,
the
congress
meant
a
five-mile
belt
extending
around
the
periphery.
the
act
contains
no
limitations
on
tva
service
within
the
primary
area.
it
contains
certain
limitations
and
service
within
the
peripheral
area.
one
of
which
is
that
we
may
not
serve
within
a
municipality
which
is
receiving
power
from
another
source
on
or
after
july
1st,
1957.
then
the
act
speaks
of
what
we
think
is
a
third
area
and
that
is
described
in
these
terms.
nothing
in
this
subsections,
subsection
(a)
of
15d,
shall
prevent
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
from
supplying
electric
power
to
any
customer
within
any
area
in
which
the
corporation
or
its
distributors
had
generally
established
electric
service
on
july
1st,
1957
into
which,
electric
service
was
not
being
supplied
from
any
other
source
on
the
effective
date
of
this
act
which
is
august
6,
1959.
that
we
think
is
a
catchall,
an
insurance
kind
of
provision.
congress
knew
for
example
that
we
were
serving
an
ac
complex
delivering
huge
quantities
of
power
to
it
up
here
in
kentucky
where
we
moved
from
that
pink
area.
they
were
serving
customer
in
tarrant
city,
alabama
down
here.
there
were
possibilities
that
perhaps
the
distributor
lines
existing
on
july
1st,
1957
might
have
been
extended
outside
the
57
peripheral
areas
between
57
and
59.
we
think
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
section
where
it
was
designed
to
take
care
of
and
we
also
do
not
believe
that
it
can
possibly
be
read
as
i
think
ku
raised
it
as
a
limitation
on
the
first
two
areas
since
it
begins,
nothing
shall
prevent.
we
don't
think
that
that
can
be
read
dramatically
as
a
limitation.
now
ku
also
relies
on
legislative
history.
we
think
that
reliance
is
erroneous.
the
bill
which
became
section
15d
was
past
first
by
the
house.
and
as
so
passed,
it
included
an
amendment
offered
by
representative
benson
which
would
have
prevented
with
the
exception
of
service
to
certain
named
towns
the
supplying
of
power
outside
the
service
area
of
the
corporation
has
existed
on
july
1st,
1957.
now
when
the
bill
went
over
to
the
senate
and
got
before
the
senate
public
works
committee,
there
is
obviously
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
respect
to
the
term
“service
area”.
one
reason
being
that
at
that
time
the
only
limitation
on
tva's
supplying
of
power
was
that
it
had
to
be
within
economic
transmission
distance
of
a
tva
dam
on
the
tennessee
river.
that
obviously
was
not
a
very
specific
limitation
and
it
was
one
which
is
subject
to
change
with
technological
change
and
with
economic
change.
some
members
of
the
senate
committee,
senator
kerr
for
one
as
he
said
the
floor,
interpreted
service
area
to
include
everything
that
we
might
then
supply
as
being
within
economic
transmission
distance.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
senator
kerr
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
subcommittee
has
considered
the
bill
your
honor.
then
other
members
obviously
thought
it
was
so
much
a
narrower
provision.
it
would
appear
that
congressman
benson
himself
may
have
intended
it
as
a
narrower
provision.
but
in
any
event,
the
senate
committee
decided,
so
they
said
in
their
report
that
it
was
a
nebulous
term
difficult
to
define
and
it's
substituted
the
term
area
for
which
tva
was
the
primary
source
of
power
supply.
now
i
don't
think
if
there's
any
question
about
what
the
senate
committee
meant
when
it
used
that
term.
it's
said
expressly
that
that
term
meant
the
area
in
which
tva
was
the
chief
or
principal
supplier
of
power
on
july
1st,
1957.
it
also
said
that
while
its
version
of
the
bill
which
would
have
permitted
us
to
serve
everything
within
the
area
for
which
we
were
the
sort
--
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
plus
an
additional
2000
square
miles
or
2.5%.
it
said
that
that
version
would
permit
elasticity
and
adjustments,
adjustments
on
the
periphery
of
the
area
presently
supplied
and
within
that
area.
it
made
pretty
clear
what
kind
of
adjustments
to
have
in
mind.
it
said,
within
the
general
area
receiving
tva
power,
there
are
small
areas
served
by
a
private
power
entirely
surrounded
by
the
lines
of
tva
distributors.
there
are
also
many
areas
in
which
the
lines
of
tv
--
of
distributors
of
tva
power
and
the
lines
of
private
power
companies
were
interlaced.
and
we
think
that
describes
the
situation
in
and
around
the
tazewells
as
well
as
any
can
possibly
could.
now
ku
says
that
the
senate
committee
report
is
irrelevant
because
after
the
bill
was
reported
out,
there
was
adopted
what
was
one
small
change
was
the
final
version
of
the
bill,
an
amendment
cosponsored
by
senator
randolph,
the
randolph
amendment.
ku
says
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
amendment
was
in
effect
a
return
to
the
house
version
of
the
bill
considered
in
a
stricter
sense.
well,
we
just
believe
that
that
is
erroneous.
it
certainly
wasn't
for
one
thing.
it
included
the
five-mile
belt
which
the
house
bill
certainly
didn't.
it
included
the
third
area
which
i
mentioned
which
the
house
bill
certainly
didn't
but
most
importantly,
it
retained
the
language
area
for
which
tva
was
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
after
the
senate
committee
had
made
perfectly
clear
what
it
meant
by
that
language.
and
the
senate
committee's
explanation
incidentally
of
course
accords
fully
with
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
term
“primary”.
primary
means
first
in
rank
or
importance,
chief
or
principal
which
is
just
what
the
senate
committee
said
it
meant.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
the
question
is,
the
area
for
which
we
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
which
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
but
the
term
primary
describes
the
term
area.
the
area
that
we're
dealing
with
is
the
one
for
which
we're
the
primary
source
of
power
supply.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
the
an
--
the
question
your
honor
is
whether
the
area
in
effect
includes
something
approximating
everything
within
the
pink
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
or
whether
utility
islands
within
that
pink
line
are
excluded.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
think
you're
right
your
honor.
now
the
randolph
amendment,
we
think
also
designed
from
the
use
of
the
statutory
language
as
the
senate
committee
had
explained
with
the
elasticity
and
adjustment
both
on
the
periphery
and
within
the
periphery,
the
randolph
amendment
did
not
change
that
basic
concept.
also,
senator
randolph
had
made
very
clear
in
his
supplementary
reviews
to
the
senate
report
what
his
problem
was
with
the
senate
committee
version
of
the
bill.
that
version
as
i
said
permitted
this
to
supply
an
additional
2000
miles
without
limiting
it
to
anything
necessarily
contiguous
to
the
primary
area.
and
he
was
afraid
that
we
might
run
a
narrow
corridor
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
miles
and
with
a
long
distance
away
perhaps
as
he
put
it
even
getting
up
to
his
homestead
of
west
virginia.
the
final
version
keeps
the
2000
mile
limitation
on
the
peripheral
area
but
it
limits
it
to
the
five-mile
belt.
now
ku
also
relies
on
some
subsequent
legislative
history.
in
1966,
which
we
think
directly
contradicts
its
theory,
the
original
59
legislation
that
authorizes
to
issue
bonds
in
the
total
amount
of
$750
million.
the
1966
legislation
increased
that
to
$1,750,000,000.
at
the
time
that
legislation
was
before
the
senate
public
works
committee,
the
jackson
purchase
world
electric
cooperative
appears
before
the
committee
and
asked
to
be
specifically
--
asked
that
it
be
named
specifically
in
the
legislation
so
that
tva
could
serve
it.
jackson
purchase
served
an
area
up
here
in
the
extreme
portion
of
northwestern
kentucky.
it
was
a
customer
of
ku.
it
had
come
to
tva
and
asked
that
we
serve
it.
the
tva
board
had
determined
in
that
case
that
we
could
not
legally
supply
it
under
the
terms
of
the
1959
amendment
and
jackson
purchase
there
upon
filed
suit
against
this
for
mandatory
injunction
as
a
preference
customer
to
seek
an
order
requiring
that
we
serve
it.
that
suit
was
pending
at
the
time
of
the
1966
hearing.
the
senate
committee
denied
jackson
purchase's
request
and
in
doing
so,
it
discussed
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
adopted
in
1959.
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
randolph
submitted
the
report
for
the
senate
committee.
he
was
now
a
chairman
both
of
the
senate
public
works
committee
and
of
the
flight
control
subcommittee
which
considered
that
legislation.
and
that
senate
committee
report
speaks
just
as
did
the
59
report.
it
says,
the
act
permits
an
increase
in
such
area
of
2.5%
or
2000
square
miles
which
ever
is
the
lesser
or
of
which
tva
was
the
chief
or
principal
supplier
of
power
in
july
1st,
1957.
and
then
it
indicated
its
understanding
of
what
it
meant
by
the
legislation.
it
goes
back
and
actually
quotes
from
the
1959
senate
committee
report.
on
page
57
of
ku's
brief,
they
quote
a
portion
of
the
59
senate
committee
report
and
say
that
the
senate
--
that
the
randolph
amendment
was
a
departure
from
it.
well
now
here
on
66,
along
comes
the
senate
committee
and
quotes
from
the
very
paragraph
of
that
report
to
which
they
refer
on
page
57
of
their
brief,
saying
in
part,
it,
the
legislation
will
permit
desirable
minor
adjustments
on
the
periphery
of
the
area
presently
supplied
and
within
that
area.
now,
i
think
if
it's
once
recognized
that
the
primary
area
is
that
area
for
which
we
were
the
chief
source
of
power
supply,
not
the
sole
source
of
power
supply
and
may
include
some
private
utility
customers
then
there
is
considerable
discretion
as
to
how
that
primary
area
shall
be
drawn.
the
tva
board's
interpretation
of
this
was
that
the
act
indicated
that
they
should
draw
stable
boundaries,
boundaries
within
the
area,
the
utilities,
tva,
and
the
people
could
live
with,
and
we
think
that
is
correct.
we
also
think
that
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
proper
in
that
situation
to
include
the
tazewells
as
within
the
area.
in
fact,
we
think
it
had
been
--
would
have
been
most
unreasonable
to
exclude
them.
the
determination
made
by
the
board
i
think
was
a
mixed
one
of
law
and
fact.
the
legal
part
was
that
as
i
have
said,
the
area
was
a
single
area
with
a
perimeter
around
it
and
with
some
private
utility
--
islands
of
private
utility
service
inside.
the
back
portion
of
it
was
that
the
tazewells
were
inside
the
periphery.
this
was
an
executive
determination.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
act
for
notice
for
hearings
and
the
thing
of
the
--
things
normally
associated
with
adjudicatory
process.
it
was
an
executive
or
management
determination
incident
to
the
sale
of
property
in
this
case,
tva
power
and
contracting
for
the
sale
of
that
power.
even
in
the
case
of
quasi
judicial
agencies,
i
think
this
court
has
gone
a
long
way
in
deferring
to
the
construction,
contemporaneous
construction
of
statutory
terms
by
such
agencies.
and
of
course
it
upholds
their
fact
determinations
where
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
support.
i
think
that
the
scope
of
judicial
review
in
the
case
of
an
executive
determination
is
narrow.
i
think
the
principle
has
been
--
then
accepted
ever
since
(inaudible)
against
paul
then
the
case
of
such
a
determination
unless
the
act
is
in
effect
a
ministerial
act,
the
court
will
not
substitute
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
executive
agency
either
as
to
the
law,
if
there's
any
question
about
its
meaning,
or
the
facts
unless
the
executive
agency
is
just
going
clear
(inaudible).
now
certainly,
the
tva
board's
determination
both
of
law
in
fact
in
this
case
can
hardly
be
unreasonable
where
a
long
experienced
district
judge
after
a
four-day
trial,
indicates
that
he
agrees
independently
both
with
the
interpretation
of
law
and
the
interpretation
of
the
facts.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor,
we
do
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
because
we
think
the
rule
has
always
been
that
where
you
have
an
executive
determination,
one
that
is
not
associated
with
adjudication,
a
situation
where
the
executive
is
called
upon
in
performing
its
normal
duties
to
look
at
the
statutes
under
which
it
acts
and
act
accordingly
that
you
have
there
a
question
of
executive
discretion.
and
unless
you
have
a
ministerial
act
situation,
the
court's
have
not
historically
intervened
to
either
a
mandamus
or
injunction.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
it
certainly
couldn't
be
rule
making,
your
honor,
because
the
administrative
procedure
act
expressly
excludes
anything
having
to
do
with
property
or
contracts
from
rulemaking.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
yes,
it
is
that.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct
and
that's
what
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
administrative
procedure
act
provides
for.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
not
practically
immune.
if
for
example,
the
court
should
think
that
the
law
is
absolutely
and
completely
clear
against
the
agency's
construction
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
matter
then
you
have
a
ministerial
situation
and
a
mandamus
or
injunction
would
lie.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
i'm
about
to
get
to
that
right
now.
that
of
course
is
the
threshold
question.
and
i
think
the
factors
there
that
are
of
primary
importance
are
first,
that
ku
has
no
exclusive
franchise
to
serve
in
claiborne
county.
it's
a
non-exclusive
franchise.
and
second,
that
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
under
tennessee
law
are
entitled
to
compete.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
act
expressly
gives
municipality
such
authority.
now,
ku's
theory
here
is
that
the
competition
is
illegible
not
because
the
towns
had
no
right
to
compete
but
because
tva
was
unlawfully
supplying
power
ot
them.
we
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
their
situation
from
alabama
power
company
against
ickes.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
challenged
loan
--
there
were
challenged
loans
and
grants
by
the
emergency
administrator
of
public
works
for
the
purpose
of
financing
municipal
construction
of
electric
distribution
systems.
and
this
court
said
that
the
utility
company
could
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
federal
action,
loan
some
grants
which
made
possible
competition
which
in
itself
was
legal.
here,
tva
is
not
furnishing
loan
to
grants,
its
furnishing
power
and
we
think
the
basic
situation
is
the
same.
also,
we
think
that
the
duty
here
that
tva
owes,
is
a
duty
not
owed
to
any
private
party
but
a
duty
owed
to
the
government.
we
think
that
congress
reserved
to
itself
the
authority
to
determine
whether
the
tva
board
was
doing
its
duty
in
applying
the
statute
and
itself
giving
adequate
protection
of
utilities
as
of
course
we
did
in
the
case
of
middlesborough
and
in
the
case
of
jackson
purchase.
and
in
that
connection
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
read
briefly
from
the
senate
committee
report.
i
seem
not
to
have
it
your
honors
but
what
they
said
in
that
case
was
that
nothing
in
this
act
would
change
the
basic
relationship
between
congress
and
tva
that
tva
would
be
held
as
it
always
has
been
accountable
for
results.
it
would
have
to
come
before
congress
each
year
in
connection
with
its
appropriations
for
its
other
programs
at
which
time
its
power
program
could
also
be
reviewed.
and
it
said
that
it
in
effect
would
rely
upon
the
tva
board
to
carry
out
faithfully
the
duties
entrusted
to
it.
i
would
now
like
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
deal
to
mr.
stanifer
and
to
reserve
the
balance
of
what
time
we
have
after
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
i
first
want
to
deal
with
this
question
of
specific
municipalities
because
there
is
in
the
statute
15d
an
expressed
provision
relating
to
them.
and
it
starts
again
with
the
language
nothing
shall
prevent
service
to
certain
named
municipalities.
now
the
way
that
got
into
the
legislation
was
this.
those
--
most
of
those
were
added
in
the
house
at
a
time
when
it
adopted
the
benson
amendment
with
its
service
area
limitation.
when
the
matter
came
before
the
senate
committee,
other
municipalities
appeared
with
their
congressman,
their
senators
and
i
think
just
about
everybody
who
asked
for
such
a
specific
exception
got
one.
now,
the
senate
committee
reported
out
its
version
of
the
bill
with
those
exceptions
still
there.
and
it
was
logical
that
they
should
because
there
is
no
assurance
of
that
time
what
final
--
what
form
the
bill
was
going
to
take.
should
it
for
example
go
to
conference?
it
is
logical
therefore
to
preserve
those
exceptions.
further,
if
i
understand
ku's
brief
correctly,
it
admits
that
the
senate
committee
version
of
the
bill
would
permit
us
to
exercise
the
discretion
that
we
have
exercised
and
to
serve
the
tazewells.
well,
all
of
those
exceptions
were
included
in
the
bills
as
were
reported
out
by
the
senate
committee.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
the
right
to
determine
the
periphery
of
that
area
for
which
we
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply,
the
chief
supplier
or
the
principal
supplier.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no
sir
but
i
think
we
were
in
cumberland
county
as
a
whole
and
i
think
that
the
tazewells
were
islands
inside
that
primary
area.
now
with
reference
to
these
maps,
we
did
prepare
as
mr.
marshall
said,
a
number
of
maps.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
them,
you
will
see
that
they
are
virtually
artist's
renderings.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
presented
here.
and
they
just
didn't
take
into
account
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
if
we
are
going
like
--
by
something
like
that,
i
might
in
reply
say
that
before
the
house
committee,
ku
presented
a
map.
its
sheet
8(b)
of
exhibit
volume
1
and
it
shows
the
tazewells
within
what
they
call
the
tva
service
area.
i
don't
think
that
the
situation
can
be
decided
by
maps
that
were
not
prepared
without
reference
to
the
question
at
hand.
the
only
such
map
as
exhibit
91
and
the
accuracy
of
that
has
nowhere
been
challenged.
now
they
talk
about
the
roe-osborn
map.
that
map
was
prepared
in
1960
by
two
local
managers
of
ku
and
powell
valley
respectively.
it
was
never
accepted
by
the
powell
valley
cooperative.
in
fact,
when
ku
presented
ku
with
the
1961
proposed
agreement
which
called
for
a
territory
agreement
based
on
those
maps,
powell
valley
refused
to
accept
it.
moreover,
on
that
roe-osborn
map
if
the
court
will
examine
it
and
it
is
number
14.
that
map
itself
shows
that
there
is
a
separation
between
what
ku
claims
are
two
of
its
areas
of
service.
that
separation
occurs
right
here
where
the
line
of
powell
valley
crosses,
so
that
their,
it
seems
to
me
under
any
theory
of
the
case,
we
incidentally
had
a
large
blow
off
of
that
so
that
the
court
could
see
it
more
clearly
and
we
outlined
in
pink
so
that
it
could
and
you
will
notice
that
there
is
a
separation
just
at
that
point
between
their
so-called
corridors
so
that
under
area
(inaudible).
this
is
an
island
inside
the
tva
periphery
whether
it's
drawn
there
or
whether
it's
drawn
where
we
finally
drew
up
here
at
the
state
line.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
exactly
correct
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
adjustment
within
the
periphery
that
the
senate
committee
spoke
of.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
our
rates
are
lower
than
theirs.
that
of
course
is
where
the
towns
would
prefer
to
have
tva
power.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
those
islands?
probably
so,
quite
possible.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
for
an
electrically
heated
home
of
average
size,
their
rates
were
two
and
a
half
times
as
high.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
because
your
honor,
they
spoke
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
it
that
they
intended
that
there
be
adjustments
around
the
periphery
and
within
the
periphery.
now
the
only
kind
of
adjustments
they
could
possibly
mean
were
a
transfer
of
one
kind
of
service
to
another.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
read
this
language
from
the
senate
report.
within
the
general
area
receiving
tva
power,
there
are
small
areas
served
by
private
power
entirely
surrounded
by
the
lines
of
tva
distributors.
that
is
the
exact
situation
here
in
the
tazewell.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
because
it
explained,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
the
kind
of
adjustments
within
the
periphery
of
our
area
that
they
anticipated
would
take
place
and
should
take
place.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
inside
the
periphery.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
what
size?
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
periphery
is
a
more
accurately
drawn
--
of
line
around
our
--
the
area
in
which
we
are
the
chief
supplier
and
that
would
approximate
the
line
on
that
big
map
although
it
is
exactly
accurate.
there
was
reference
to
this,
senator
randolph
himself
who
proposed
the
amendment
that
finally
became
law,
said
in
the
very
last
part
of
his
supplemental
views
of
course
consistent
with
this
view,
and
the
view
he's
talking
about
is
that
we
ought
to
be
more
limited
in
the
peripheral
area.
of
course,
consistent
with
this
view,
tva
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
any
islands
which
now
exist
within
its
geographical
operating
area
as
it
existed
on
july
1st,
1957.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
senator
randolph,
your
honor,
and
he
proposed
the
amendment
on
the
senate
floor,
it
was
finally
adopted.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
this
area?
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
well,
i
don't
concede
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
anyway
to
protect
the
islands
within
our
perimeter.
now
it
was
to
afford
though
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
in
the
--
they
were
to
be
protected
by
confining
tva
service
within
the
periphery
of
the
primary
area
plus
the
five-mile
belt
around
it
plus
the
third
area
i
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
--
in
any
particular
towns
that
might
be
involved.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
oh,
surely
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
it's
protected
middlesborough.
the
tva
board
decided
it
couldn't
serve
it.
they're
protected
over
here
as
to
jackson
purchase
when
the
tva
board
decided
it
couldn't
serve
it
and
where
we
were
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
precisely.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
that's
exactly
correct
your
honor.
but
its
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not.
the
tva
board
finally
drew
the
line
of
the
state
line.
so,
no
earthly
way
to
draw
any
corridor.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
we
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
we
would
contend
your
honor
that
the
five-miles
would
take
in
everything
except
for
the
town
of
cumberland
gap.
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
no,
not
tazewell
for
the
reason
of
the
five
miles.
we
think
the
five
--
that
tazewell
has
to
be
inside
the
perimeter
when
it's
drawn
up
here,
here,
or
here.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
five-mile
peripheral
area
does
not
permit
us
to
serve
within
municipalities.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes
your
honor.
we
read
differently
than
does
mr.
marshall,
this
business
about
distributors
within
the
area.
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
i
will
simply
say
that
i
think
that's
just
a
descriptive
word.
it
started
out
communities
in
the
area
and
the
congress
deliberately
changed
it
to
tva
and
its
distributors
including
cooperatives,
so
i
don't
think
it
can
possibly
have
the
meaning
that
he
ascribes
to
it.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
mention
judge
--
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
of
the
district
court's
findings.
the
district
court
had
done
a
judgment
which
it
said
included
its
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
within
the
course
of
the
--
four
corners
of
the
opinion.
and
judge
taylor
in
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
marquis
yes.
yes
your
honor.
and
one
thing
that
judge
taylor
said
was
maps
show
that
the
lines
of
powell
valley
crossed
the
lines
of
ku
at
one
point
in
the
so-called
corridor.
he
also
said
the
finding
of
the
board,
tva
board,
was
made
in
good
faith
and
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
on
the
discretion
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
said
to
tva,
one,
before
this
act
was
passed,
you
must
serve
a
preference
customer
if
you
legally
can
serve.
those
are
that
--
that
provision
is
in
section
10
and
section
12
of
the
tva
act.
then
it
said
to
us
here,
confine
yourself
within
the
periphery
of
the
area
for
which
you
are
the
primary,
the
chief,
or
principal
supplier
plus
the
peripheral
area
and
so
on.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
such
circumstances
when
a
preference
customer
comes
to
us
whether
it's
the
tazewells,
whether
it's
middlesborough,
whether
it's
jackson
purchase,
that
the
tva
board
must
make
a
determination
one
way
or
the
other.
it's
his
job.
it's
got
to
do
it
in
carrying
on
its
functions
under
the
tva
act.
now
mr.
marshall
indicated
that
no
determination
was
made
until
1964.
well,
certainly,
the
tazewells
were
told
in
1960
that
they
could
be
served.
and
in
1962,
the
tva
board
certainly
made
a
determination
when
it
constructed
tva
staff
to
give
powell
valley
assurance
that
tva
would
supply
the
necessary
power
to
serve
the
tazewells
even
though
that
might
mean
tva
is
spending
$750,000
for
additional
transmission.
now,
i
found
incidentally
in
connection
with
that
discretion
point,
the
paragraphs
that
i
was
looking
for
in
the
senate
committee
report.
i
have
only
a
minute
in
the
relation
of
the
standard.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
indicate
that
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
ride
a
herd
so
to
speak
on
the
tva
board,
and
that
our
duty
was
owed
to
the
government,
not
the
private
litigants.
the
committee
said
--
the
committee
believes
that
the
tva
board
would
not
be
reckless
in
utilizing
the
authority
to
provide
additional
service
which
actually
amounts
to
less
than
one
mile
around
the
periphery
or
the
present
area
in
which
tva
power
is
used.
it
were
properly
used
such
authority
to
supply
isolated
communities
from
contiguous
areas
extension
to
rural
areas
and
expanded
municipal
areas,
and
minor
and
necessary
adjustments
around
the
periphery
and
within
the
area
in
which
power
is
now
supplied.
hr3460
where
the
amendments
proposed
by
the
committee
does
not
change
the
basic
administrative
premise
of
the
tva
act.
the
tva
board
will
continue
to
be
held
fully
responsible
by
the
congress
for
the
results
of
its
operations
and
will
have
corresponding
administrative
authority
in
the
discharge
of
this
responsibility.
the
actions
of
the
board
will
be
subject
to
annual
review
by
the
congress.
and
of
course
they're
also
subject
every
five
years
because
congress
gives
us
an
increase
in
bond
authorization
that
will
last
for
about
that
period
of
time
and
then
we
have
to
come
back.
under
those
circumstances,
it's
our
position
as
i
indicated
in
perkins
against
lukens
steel,
i
think
is
the
case
closest
to
it
that
the
duty
owed
by
tva
is
due
to
the
government,
is
owed
to
the
government
and
not
to
private
litigants
and
that
there
was
no
intention
to
confer
a
standing.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
