that's

justice

what

yes.
justice

what

it's

(inaudible)
justice

well,

don't

about
my

question
and
this

is
dated,
am
i
wrong?
november
30,
1944?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
that
date,
the
november
30,
1944?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however,
it
says
general
revision.
is
your
map
say
--
general
revision
on
it
at
the
bottom?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
revision
says
some
date
in
1945.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
revised
1945,
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
that
something
happened
later.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
what
that
is.
justice
abe
fortas
and
now,
tell
me
what
this
corridor
means
if
anything
which
you
referred
to
as
a
corridor?
justice
abe
fortas
he
doesn't
refer
to
this
corridor,
does
he?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
telling
us
that
when
this
is
seen
by
kentucky
utilities,
all
these
lines
are
on
this
map.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
also
--
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
this
was
made
up
subsequent
to
1945
except
to
this
letter?
justice
abe
fortas
and
anything
in
the
letter
would
indicate
when
a
drawing
was
made
on
the
map
and
there's
no
data
there
--
no
occasion
of
their
revision
at
‘45,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
explain
the
corridor
to
me
if
you
will,
please.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
referring
to
this
as
a
corridor.
i
don't
know
what
a
corridor
is,
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
your
reliance
here
that
--
going
down,
scoop
down
a
southeasterly
direction
on
this
map
but
that
doesn't
indicate
--
i
don't
know
why
it's
called
a
corridor
because
there's
any
--
no
allocation
of
that
territory
to
you
so
far
as
i
know
by
law,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
do
--
please
tell
me
what
significance
you
place
upon
these
so-called
divisions
of
territory?
justice
abe
fortas
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
the
powell
valley
acknowledgements
if
such
there
were
are
binding
on
tva?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
mr.
marquis
told
us
that
in
the
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
areas
as
--
power
were
supplied
by
two
tva
distributors,
powell
valley
and
what's
the
other
one?
justice
abe
fortas
where
--
and
what
about
la
follette?
is
la
follette
acknowledged
your
boundaries?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
about
controversy
between
la
follette.
that
--
doesn't
la
follette
supply
some
customers
in
new
tazewell
or
tazewell?
justice
abe
fortas
in
such
additional
area,
would
you
go
again?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
wait
a
minute.
justice
abe
fortas
just
go
ahead
with
the
exact
language
in
reference
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
well
as
that
of
mr.
justice
black.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
in
the
government's
brief
--
justice
abe
fortas
page
43
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
i
perhaps
misunderstood
you
but
the
statute
does
say
to
care
for
the
growth
of
tva
and
its
distributors
within
the
said
area,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
real
--
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
your
statement
that
you
included
that
tva
could
include
--tva
area
and
kentucky
utility
area
and
say
that
tva
is
bigger
in
that
whole
area
so
that
whole
area
is
a
primary
area
of
tva.
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
their
position
and
they
can
help
me
on
it.
as
i
understand
it,
what
tva
is
saying
is
that
there
is
this
area
marked
out
by
the
pink
lines
on
the
map
there
in
which
tva
is
a
major
supplier
that
within
that
area
in
the
case
at
bar
there
is
the
sort
of
packet
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
which
is
served
by
kentucky
utilities.
if
that
pocket,
being
within
the
total
primary
area
that
tva
may
supply
power
to
its
distributor
that
may
supply
tazewell
consistently
with
the
statute.
and
it
is
my
statement
of
that
position
wrong
as
you
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
very
leery
of
that
card
as
was
drawn
in
there
and
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
tva
didn't
draw
it.
tva
drew
that
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
for
but
it
certainly
doesn't
represent
anything
realistic
in
terms
of
the
utility
industry
that
i
know
of.
and
i'm
sure
you're
not
going
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
valid
binding
division
of
territory
between
powell
valley
and
kentucky
utilities.
i'm
sure
that
kentucky
utilities
wouldn't
engage
in
any
said
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
suggesting
whatever
that
suggests
to
your
mind.
but
i
don't
think
you
to
suggest
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
taking
that
position
but
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
one
way
or
the
other
whether
the
congress
intended
that
this
statute
would
mean
that
pockets
of
private
utility
operation
within
the
general
area
of
tva
operation
should
be
reserved
to
the
private
--
to
private
utilities
and
free
from
competition
by
tva
and
its
distributors.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
a
very
plain
question.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
no,
i
think
we're
getting
something
that
accurate
that
you
got
to
grip
on
because
your
position
is
then,
as
i
understand
it,
that
what
ex
--
with
the
exception
of
the
specifically
named
communities,
congress
intended
that
within
the
general
operating
area
of
the
tva
and
its
pipeline
that
where
there
is
a
pocket
served
by
a
private
utility,
95%
or
100%,
that
that
pocket
will
continue
so
long
as
this
legislation
is
on
the
books,
break
from
competition
by
tva
and
its
distributors.
justice
abe
fortas
aren't
you
going
to
say
something
about
standing?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
they
still
press
the
point
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
always
follow,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
will
put
this
very
simply
in
a
rough
language.
your
view
of
it
as
if
congress
said
that
tva
now
--
there
has
to
be
a
determination
of
the
area
of
the
tva
service.
now
within
that
area,
you
may
clean
up
the
situation
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
sense
of
cleaning
out
--
providing
competition
to
pockets
which
are
--
may
now
be
served
by
private
utility
companies
but
then
stay
in
that
area
and
don't
go
outside
of
it
except
for
the
five-mile
limitation.
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
where
you
look
at
it.
