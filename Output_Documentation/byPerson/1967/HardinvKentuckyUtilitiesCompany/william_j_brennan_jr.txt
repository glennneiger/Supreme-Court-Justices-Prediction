i

exhibit
volume

i'll
--
probably,
the
clerk
would
have
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
was
it
that
--
why
wasn't
this
something
like
a
rulemaking
by
executive
or
administrative
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
say
it
was
rule
making
within
that,
i
just
--
i
--
isn't
it
like
rulemaking?
it's
really
an
instruction
of
the
statute
by
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
certainly
the
administrative
agency
of
the
rulemaking
has
some
kind
of
previous
notice
and
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
public?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes,
i
didn't
suggest
the
lack
of
--
it
applies,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
except
where
it
does
apply
that
this
sort
of
determination
by
executive
agency
have
always
been
and
should
be
practically
immune
judicially?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are
you
going
to
argue
standing
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the

today?
justice
william
j.

as

justice
william
j.

is
there
any
--
is
there
a
finding
in
the

court
--
the
trial
court
can't
hold
against
you,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
fact
finding
under
this
thing
that
mr.
justice
black
was
asking
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
government‘s
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
marshall
at
page
321,
(inaudible)
said
this.
the
history
of
the
1959
act
supports
the
finding
of
the
tva
board,
it
was
the
finding
of
the
tva
board
that
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
where
within
the
primary
area
served
by
tva
and
its
supplier
as
of
july
1,
1957.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
of
the
1959
act
can
be
construed
to
two
tazewells
and
the
primary
service
centers
served
by
tva
and
its
suppliers
as
of
the
july
1,
1957.
is
there
anything
in
the
way
of
a
finding
on
this
thing
whether
you
discussed,
whether
the
judge
(inaudible)
or
if
he's
just
saying
the
‘59
act
authorize
the
board
to
make
this
determination
inclined
with
the
determination
by
the
board
to
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
(inaudible)
the
finding
of
the
board
was
made
in
good
faith
and
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that's
rather
charging
this
(inaudible)
in
the
administrative
agency
determination
plainly
reviewed
by
the
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
his
determination
was
that
whatever
power
regions,
service
areas
or
whatever
they
may
be,
his
determination
was
that
the
tazewells
found
within
the
area
of
tva,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
is
the
--
i
gather
you
concede
that
one
purpose
of
(inaudible)
to
this
legislation
was
to
protect
the
five

something.

what
is
(inaudible)
