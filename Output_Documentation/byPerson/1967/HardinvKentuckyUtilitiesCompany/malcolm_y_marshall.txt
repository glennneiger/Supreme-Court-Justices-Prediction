mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
what
we
believe
to
be
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
i
want
to
respond
briefly
to
mr.
stanifer's
statement
on
behalf
of
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
unless
tva
is
to
be
permitted
to
expand
its
service
to
include
the
entire
country,
there
must
always
be
a
border
between
tva
on
the
one
hand
and
investor
owned
utilities
on
the
other.
that
border
will
always
be
a
top
situation.
the
investor
owned
utilities
and
i
do
not
propose
to
get
into
the
philosophy
of
public
against
private
power
but
the
investor
owned
utilities
cannot
pay
federal
and
state
income
taxes
in
the
full
capital
cost
of
their
facilities
and
still
sell
power
as
cheaply
as
tva.
there
are
two
alternatives.
one
is
to
give
this
tax
free
power
to
whatever
group
happens
to
be
just
outside
the
current
border,
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
if
you
do
that,
you
have
not
eliminated
the
border
problems.
you
simply
push
them
back
to
another
area
where
they
will
reoccur
next
year,
a
different
group.
the
second
alternative
is
to
draw
a
boundary
as
of
some
given
time
and
say
that's
it.
that's
as
far
as
we're
going
to
let
it
go.
in
the
1959
statute,
congress
adopted
the
second
alternative.
again,
in
1966
when
jackson
purchase
went
back
to
congress
and
said
that
we're
just
outside
the
boundary.
we
have
the
same
intolerable
situation
which
the
cities
have
described
this
morning,
making
exception
for
us,
congress
said
no.
we
drew
the
boundary
in
the
1959
act
and
we're
going
to
adhere
to
it.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
kentucky
utilities
exchanges
power
with
tva
at
a
number
of
points,
one
of
them
being
here
at
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
do
not
buy
power
from
tva.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
one
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
there's
a
very
little
on
that.
the
exchange
works
out
--
i'm
not
in
the
position
where
i
can
answer
the
question
but
it
is
a
pay
back
of
power.
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
pay
back
actually,
tva
uses
more
of
our
power
than
we
use
of
theirs.
we
exchange
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
didn't
understand
the
first
word.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
that's
not
the
point
of
our
exchanges
with
tva.
there
are
areas
in
which
we
have
transmission
facilities
available
where
tva
loads
grew.
in
those
areas,
we
supply
power
for
the
account
of
tva.
there
are
reversed
areas
where
they
have
transmission
available
for
our
loads
grew
and
they
supply
power
for
our
account.
there
is
no
difference
in
base
load
and
peaking
power.
and
if
i
--
as
i
say
it,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
on
the
facts,
the
exchange
is
virtually
equal.
we
are
not
customers
of
tva.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
i
know
the
point
of
your
question
and
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright
sir.
we
had
understood
that
there
were
three
issues
in
this
case
and
i'm
really
genuinely
baffled
by
mr.
marquis'
statement
of
the
issues.
he
did
not
seem
to
me
to
state
an
issue
on
the
merits.
we
have
felt
that
the
three
issues
we're
standing
to
sue
the
substantive
question
on
the
merits
and
administrative
discretion.
what
effect
is
to
give
to
the
so-called
termination
by
the
tva
board?
particularly
in
this
case,
administrative
discretion
cannot
be
considered
apart
from
the
facts.
so
i
would
propose
to
discuss
the
facts
and
the
substantive
question
on
the
merits
first.
that
question
is,
are
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
to
which
electric
service
admittedly
is
being
supplied
by
ku
on
july
1,
1957
outside
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
that
date.
i
would
emphasize
that
there
is
no
dispute
in
any
basic
operative
fact
in
the
case.
for
example,
ku
on
the
statutory
date
supply,
95%
of
the
customers
sold
95%
of
the
power
consumed
in
the
towns.
powell
valley
in
contrast
had
a
few
customers
in
the
eastern
edge
of
the
towns.powell
valley's
lines
in
the
rural
area
had
extended
in
to
the
eastern
edge.
this
map
which
is
exhibit
b
shows
customers
not
as
of
the
statutory
date
but
as
of
april
1964.
there
is
another
map,
exhibit
25,
which
shows
the
customers
as
of
the
july
1,
1957
statutory
date.
ku
was
virtually
the
sole
supplier
of
power
in
the
tazewells.
i
would
like
to
state
the
substantive
question
in
tva
terms
in
an
indirect
discussion
of
the
facts
to
it.
tva,
general
counsel
--
former
general
counsel,
stated
the
question
as
follows
to
the
district
court
and
this
continues
to
be
mr.
marquis
statement
of
it.
it
is
the
periphery
of
the
area,
the
tva
area
that
is
not
defined.
that
is
really
the
job
to
determine
where
the
periphery
is.
does
it
go
across
the
straight
line
or
does
it
dip
down
into
to
tennessee.
now
mr.
marquis
discussed
with
you
some
exceptions
to
the
basic
primary
area
section
of
the
statute.
we
discussed
them
in
our
brief,
we
differ
with
them,
with
tva.
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
them
this
morning
because
of
time
limitations
and
because
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
generating
plant.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
does
your
assumption
include
customers
ku
had
a
generating
plant
and
served
customers
at
a
defined
area?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
--
that
is
where
we
differ
with
tva.
if
that
situation
existed
where
we
were
completely
surrounded
by
tva
service
in
island
well
within
that
territory,
it's
our
interpretation
of
the
act.
i
think
it
supported
the
legislative
history.
we
so
urge
in
our
brief
that
tva
could
not
take
that
service
area.
that's
the
point
of
difference.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
line
matter
because
that
is
not
the
situation
presented
by
this
case
if
your
honor
please.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
emphasize
that
tva
does
not
claim
that
this
is
the
island
situation.
all
we
differ
on
what
the
result
would
be
if
it
were.
tva
says
in
its
own
statement
of
the
question
--
of
the
periphery
dips
down
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
and
tva
--
if
tva
is
wrong
in
that
position,
if
the
tazewells
and
new
tazewells
are
not
thus
within
tva's
primary
area
defined
by
that
dipping
periphery,
then
tva
would
concede
that
it
cannot
take
the
tazewells.
so
that's
why
--
i'm
not
going
to
get
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
difference,
i'm
going
to
discuss
where
the
periphery
goes
because
if
we're
correct
in
that
and
the
circuit
court
so
held
in
tva
by
its
own
statement
of
the
law
loses
on
the
merits.
tva
would
have
you
believe
that
the
tazewells
are
these
islands.
if
they're
connected
in
our
service
area
only
by
the
transmission
line
which
extends
up
into
kentucky,
that
is
not
the
case.
i
want
to
talk
about
several
towns
in
tennessee,
the
tennessee
state
line
and
the
tazewells.
and
you
can
only
consider
those
matters
in
relation
to
each
other
by
reference
to
a
map.
this
map
that
i
have
is
the
map
which
was
attached
to
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion.
it's
a
so-called
tva
demerit
map.
it's
found
in
your
record
at
page
771.
it
is
the
ku
area
is
shaded
here
to
make
it
more
apparent.
this
map
was
made
not
by
ku
but
by
tva
in
1952.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
may
i
answer
that?
i'm
going
to
answer
it
in
detail.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
that's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
exactly
where
i'm
headed.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
in
kentucky,
just
north
of
the
tennessee
state
line,
kentucky
utilities
has
the
only
service
there.
tva
and
its
distributors
have
none.
there
is
a
kentucky
town
of
middlesborough
which
is
almost
on
the
state
line.
coming
on
down
in
the
northern
tennessee,
you
find
the
tennessee
towns.
now,
all
of
these
are
tennessee
communities.
cumberland
gap,
harrogate,
off
to
the
west,
(inaudible)
up
at
the
eastern
corner
shawanee,
five
miles
down
south
of
cumberland
gap,
arthur.
kentucky
utilities
is
the
only
utility
which
has
any
facilities,
customers
or
service
in
these
towns
and
in
all
of
the
area
between
them.
tva
and
its
distributors
do
not
have
any
facilities,
customers
or
service
in
the
area
i've
described.
in
this
corridor
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
something
different,
if
you've
ever
driven
through
this
part
of
the
mountains
down
there
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
it's
quite
a
bit
different.
now
in
this
corridor
which
they
would
again
have
you
believe
as
a
transmission
line,
ku
has
a
69,000
volt
major
transmission
line,
a
substation,
100
miles
of
12,000
volt
distribution
lines
which
is
shown
off
here
in
red
and
all
of
the
other
secondary
line,
services
and
other
facilities
which
are
not
shown
on
here
to
serve
about
2000
customers
in
that
county.
on
july
1,
1957,
ku
supplied
service
in
the
corridor
outside
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
to
1278
customers.
when
the
litigation
began,
powell
valley's
manager
undertook
to
make
a
map
for
using
that
litigation
on
which
you
would
show
individual
ku
customers.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
tva
and
said,
“i
cannot
do
it
because
of
the
density
on
ku's
system.”
this
corridor
is
not
empty.
it
is
not
a
transmission
line.
if
you
would
refer
to
map
exhibit
37
at
record
772
as
well
as
this
map,
exhibit
38,
you
would
see
that
ku's
facilities
fill
and
served
all
parts
of
this
corridor.
the
tazewells
are
not
islands.
they
are
not
isolated
from
the
rest
of
our
service
area.
they
are
an
integral
part
of
that
service
area
and
the
service
area
as
shown
on
this
map
continues
on
up
into
and
as
a
part
of
our
contiguous
service
area
up
in
kentucky.
on
the
map,
you
would
see
u.s.
highway
25e
running
from
harrogate
down
to
the
tazewells.
tazewell
on
the
map
is
near
the
hill
of
the
boot
and
new
tazewell
is
further
down
to
something
i
suppose
would
be
the
instep.
in
addition
to
this
matter,
the
tva
demerit
map
which
they
criticize
was
having
been
made
in
1952.
there
are
in
this
record
10
other
maps.
they
are
exhibits
26
through
35.
each
one
of
the
10
maps
was
made
by
tva,
made
published
and
distributed
by
it,
not
by
kentucky
utilities
company.
these
maps,
the
10
others
are
dated
variously
in
1956,
a
year
before
the
significant
date
in
the
statute
and
then
in
each
of
the
year
successively
through
1963.
four
of
these
10
other
tva
maps
were
made
after
this
act
became
effective
in
1959.
they
were
thus
made
at
a
time
when
everyone
knew
the
significance
of
putting
a
service
area
boundary
on
a
map.
every
one
of
these
10
maps
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no
sir.
this
--
or
the
corridor
was
put
on
here
in
1952,
the
base
map
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
are
you
looking
at
exhibit
36
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that
--
that's
the
time
the
base
map
was
made.
the
tva
engineer
who
drew
this,
mr.
demerit
used
that
base
map
and
then
he
drew
this
corridor
on
here
in
19
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
i
--
i
can't.
oh
yes,
i
see
down
there.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
evidence
says
the
letter
from
mr.
demerit,
dated
in
1952
in
which
he
indicates
that
he
used
a
base
map.
it
was
dated
1945.
this
base
map
was
not
drawn
to
show
the
corridor.
he
used
that
map
in
1952
and
sent
the
map
with
a
letter
which
says
i'm
attaching
a
map
made
up
of
our
lc
7000
series
of
distribution
maps.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
letter
is
part
of
the
exhibit
36.
the
letter
is
on
page
769
of
the
record.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
everyone
of
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
he
refers
to
it
as
an
area
now
served
by
ku.
it
means
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
everything
that's
on
this
map
except
the
dark
shading
was
there.
as
you
look
at
the
map
in
your
record,
everything
was
on
there
as
you
see
it
when
we
received
it.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
nothing
except
to
the
letter.
mr.
demerit
did
not
testify.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
what
you
mean
by
explain
the
corridor.
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
not
by
law
but
i
will
come
to
facts
that
indicate
it
was
our
recognized
territory,
recognized
by
the
defendants
themselves.
i
think
your
question
would
be
answered
or
--
each
of
these
10
other
maps
that
i've
referred
to
made
by
tva
dated
1956
through
1963
reports
to
show
the
service
area
of
tva
and
its
distributors,
each
indicates
as
an
exception
to
the
tva
service
area,
the
same
corridor.
each
of
these
maps
shows
the
tva
periphery
to
dip
down
in
the
manner
shown
on
this
demerit
map
and
to
exclude
that
geographic
area
from
the
tva
service
area
as
defined
on
these
maps.
there
are
other
acknowledgments
by
the
defendants
that
this
was
our
service
area.
in
1952
and
in
1958,
ku
and
powell
valley,
the
tva
distributor
entered
into
territorial
agreement
so
referred
to
by
the
defendants
throughout
their
correspondents,
supplementing
and
implementing
the
1958
agreement
and
i
hope
mr.
justice
fortas
that
this
may
answer
your
question.
in
1960,
representative
--
a
representative
of
powell
valley,
the
tva
distributor
and
a
representative
of
ku
went
on
the
ground.they
took
a
very
detailed
coast
and
geodetic
survey
map
which
is
in
evidence
as
exhibit
14
and
they
drew
of
the
map

entitled.
the
map
showing
agreed
territorial
boundary
lines
between
ku
and
powell
valley
in
tennessee.
the
legends
on
the
maps
are
shaded

that
designates
ku
territory.
this
map
was
made

mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it's

sir.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
entire
map
was
reprinted,
parts
of
it
i
think.
this
is
the
so-called
roe-osborn
map
because
those
are
the
names
of
the
two
men
who
made
it.
the
portion
around
the
tazewells
is

on

detail
the
boundaries.
this
map
is
so
detailed
that
it
shows
such
things
as
cemeteries,
knobs,
ponds,
ridges,
roads,
schools,
churches,
every
individual
features.
the
roe-osborn
map
shows
the
boundary
between
ku
and
powell
valley
to
start
up
in
this
area
much
like
the
tva
demerit
map
that
then
continued
down
to
this
point
where
there
is
a
single
line
crossing
which
i'll
mention
again
in
a
moment.
it
then
includes
within
the
ku
territory,
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
and
continues
up
to
a
point
about
here
midway
up.
now
the
boundary
on
the
roe-osborn
map
stops
at
that
point
because
the
area
above
it
on
the
northwest
is
served
la
follette
rather
than
powell
valley.
ku
and
la
follette
had
no
controversy
so
the
boundary
was
not
defined
here.
there's
a
waiving
cross
patched
line
just
to
get
somebody
to
the
corridor.
the
boundary
is
defined
all
down
the
east
around
the
tazewell
and
the
new
tazewell
from
about
half
way
up
by
this
roe-osborn
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
these
divisions
of
territory
constitutes
acknowledgments
by
the
defendants
themselves
that
this
was
territory
supplied
by
ku
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
and
therefore
was
not
supplied
by
tva.
it
cannot
be
considered
within
tva's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
not
saying
they're
binding
in
a
contractual
sense,
i'm
saying
they
constitute
evidence
as
to
where
the
services
were.
they
constitute
acknowledgements.
tva
itself
has
no
service
area.
it
does
not
supply
customers
except
for
a
few
large
industrial
loads.
each
area
is
the
area
of
its
distributors.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
la
follette.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
map
was
drawn
to
show
only
the
boundary
between
ku
and
powell
valley.
it
was
not
located
between
la
follette.
this
is
a
mountainous
area,
the
la
follette
facilities
run
to
a
point
about
here.
there
has
never
been
any
controversy
with
la
follette.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
not.
i
think
it
services
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
county.
i
don't
think
it
supplies
any
in
the
immediate
area
of
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
this
map
right
here?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
was
this
the
map
that
you
referred
to?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
those
are
substantially
the
boundaries.
this
map
is
not
drawn
in
the
detail
of
the
roe-osborn
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
so
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
are
you
saying
the
outer
boundaries
of
this
shaded
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
tva's
facilities
run
to
the
border
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
of
that
shaded
area
and
did
not
come
in
with
one
exception.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
they
did
not
serve
in
that
area.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
except
as
i
say
what
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
no
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
tva
does
not
claim
a
right
to
take
any
territory
in
this
case
by
reason
of
the
five-mile
periphery
provision
because
that
says
that
they
cannot
take
any
power
--
cannot
take
any
part
of
a
municipality
serve
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you're
--
and
here
outside
the
tazewell?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright.
now,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
but
the
answer
to
it
is
this.
the
five-mile
periphery
does
not
say
to
tva,
“you
can
take
anything
you
want
around
the
five
miles
without
a
basis.”
the
five-mile
periphery
was
because
there
were
some
towns
near
the
border
inside
tva
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
congress
that
those
towns
might
expand
outside
the
periphery.
so
the
five-mile
says,
you
can
go
for
up
to
five
miles
as
necessary.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
act
because
they
can
only
do
that
mr.
justice
white.
they
can
only
do
it
if
necessary
to
care
for
growth
of
their
distributors
within
the
primary
area.
that's
the
statutory
language.
it
does
not
say
you
can
expand
anywhere
you
want
to
for
five
miles
outside
of
a
municipality.
it
says
as
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
one
of
your
distributors
in
your
primary
area.
here,
tva
--
if
powell
valley
had
a
facility
outside
this
corridor
and
simply
wanted
to
go
take
a
customer,
that
would
not
be
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
powell
valley.
if
there
were
a
city
outside
that
corridor
that
grew
over
the
line,
annexed
territory,
yes,
that's
the
legislative
history
of
what
that
section
was
designed
to
correct.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
roe-osborn
map
made
jointly
between
ku
and
tva
as
distributor
of
powell
valley
delineates
the
boundary.
there
is
no
contract.
there
were
two
letter
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
between
ku
and
powell
valley.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
tva
did
not
agree
to
the
making
of
the
map.
i
do
not
know
that
it
knew
of
the
making
with
the
map.
it
was
made
by
tva's
distributor,
powell
valley
that
had
the
service
and
ku.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
don't
think
it
disputes
the
fact
set
out
in
the
map
but
it
did
not
agree
in
the
sense
of
contractual
--
or
didn't
participate
in
the
making
of
the
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
a
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer
because
part
of
our
position
in
this
lawsuit
is
that
they
offer
you
no
standard.
they
say
that
if
--
that
their
board
can
fix
the
periphery,
they
say
first
that
the
job
is
to
draw
the
periphery
and
then
they
say
that
the
board
can
draw
the
periphery
as
we
say
without
relation
to
fact.
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
we
have
pointed
in
this
record
the
facts
which
showed
very
sharply
what
the
division
is.
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it
is
a
matter
of
fact.
i
do
not
know
any
other
word
to
establish
a
utility's
boundary
other
than
in
relation
to
where
it
has
facilities
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
in
customers.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
ku
and
tva?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
far
as
i
know,
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
on
the
boundary
in
this
particular
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
other
than
as
powell
valley
is
a
representative
of
tva,
i
would
have
to
say
no.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
there
are
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
evidence
as
to
the
location
of
facilities,
customers
and
service
on
the
date
of
the
act
and
that's
the
only
way
i
know
to
fix
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you
just
say,
--
is
it
my
claiming
that
the
act
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
oh,
i
missed
that.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
precisely.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
so.
i
have
to
let
them
--
except
as
i
say
they
have
discretion
to
put
it
almost
anywhere
they
want
to
without
relation
to
facts
as
to
facilities
and
customers
which
discretion
we
do
not
find
anywhere
in
the
act.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
to
the
boundary,
i
would
say
no.
the
trial
court
brought
a
lengthy
opinion
in
which
he
recited
all
of
the
physical
facts
pretty
accurately
and
again
may
i
emphasize
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
alright.
may
i
again,
i
emphasize
to
both
of
you
that
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
the
physical
facts
as
to
where
we
have
facilities,
where
they
had
facilities,
where
we
have
customers
and
they
have
customers.
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
that
character
of
fact.
after
the
trial
court
accurately
reciting
those
facts
as
to
service,
he
then
in
about
three
paragraphs
expressed
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
did
not
intend
to
exclude
the
tazewells.
there's
difference
between
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
to
con
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
broadly,
yes,
but
as
to
the
tazewells,
congress
had
no
intention.
you
can
read
the
legislative
history.
the
tazewells
are
not
mentioned.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
justice,
we
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
not
as
to
the
facts.
we
completely
agree
where
we
had
service
and
where
we
had
facilities.
tva
does
not
disagree
with
us
on
that
character
of
fact.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
say
that
it
does
and
perhaps,
i
should
come
now
to
a
statement
of
the
basic
issue
between
them.
that's
where
we're
headed.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright
sir.
it
is
ku's
position
that
when
you
define
the
primary
service
area
of
tva
or
any
other
utility
you
can
only
do
so
in
relation
to
facilities
and
customers
on
whatever
the
given
date
is.
that
is
done
if
that
standard
is
accepted,
there's
no
question
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
exactly
what
the
1959
act
does.
it
says,
there
shall
not
be
anymore
extension
--
expansion
where
you
have
a
service
area
today,
that
is
it.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
1959
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
act
itself?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
find
the
page?
i
can
quote
it
for
you.
it
says,
“tva,
substituting
tva
for
the
corporation
shall
make
no
contracts
for
the
sale
or
delivery
of
power
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
the
area,
outside
the
area
for
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
july
1,
1957.
that's
the
statutory
language.
now
tva
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
and
such
additional
area
as
maybe
necessary,
your
honor
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
are
on
the
first
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
(inaudible)
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
page
43
of
the
government's
--
and
such
additional
area
extending
not
more
than
five
miles
around
the
periphery
of
such
area
and
here
is
the
language
i
was
basing
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
on,
as
maybe
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
the
corporation
and
its
distributors
within
said
primary
area.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
that
five
mile
provision
is
also
subject
to
itself
to
an
exception
that
it
cannot
include
any
part
of
any
area,
any
municipality
served
by
another
source
and
that
would
be
the
tazewells.
so
tva
does
not
base
any
claim.
it
disclaims
any
right
under
this
provision
we're
just
now
reading.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
say
not
the
former.
the
sixth
circuit
indicated
some
doubt
as
to
whether
judge
taylor
had
given
particular
weight
to
the
tva
board
determination.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
all
through
the
trial
of
this
action
however,
judge
taylor
indicated
clearly
that
he
was
deciding
this
case
de
novo.
tva
recognized
that
when
it
went
to
the
sixth
circuit,
tva
and
its
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit
stated
the
questions
whether
the
district
court
answered
yes,
we
answer
no
type.
but
if
the
statement
in
tva's
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit
was,
is
the
district
court
after
this
board
determination
to
try
this
matter
de
novo
and
they
said,
the
district
court
answered
the
matter,
yes,
we
think
no,
we
should
not
try
de
novo.
now
the
sixth
circuit
indicated
as
i
say,
some
doubt
as
to
what
judge
taylor
had
done,
what
he
meant
by
the
language
you've
quoted.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
judge
taylor
--
well,
i
know
judge
taylor
made
his
independent
determination
because
he
indicated
very
clearly
earlier
in
his
opinion
as
well
as
throughout
the
trial
that
he
was
going
to
decide
this
case
de
novo
and
he
did
not
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
finding
by
the
tva
board.
and
i
think
he
supported
his
decision
by
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
tva
board.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
his
conclusion
was
that
he
did
not
make
a
factual
determination
that
they
fail
within
any
periphery.
his
conclusion
was,
yes,
that
they
were
in
the
primary
area.
and
the
circuit
court,
the
sixth
circuit
said,
if
that
is
to
be
construed
as
a
finding
of
fact,
it
was
clearly
erroneous
and
such
it
is
we
submit
to
you.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
black
because
there
is
a
very
key
issue
here
that
would
not
been
able
to
develop.
what
is
tva's
position
as
to
how
its
primary
area
is
to
be
determined?
tva
says
that
even
where
there
is
a
sharp,
well-defined
boundary
as
there
is
here
and
i
would
emphasize
to
mr.
justice
fortas
what
we
mean
by
the
corridor.
powell
valley's
lines
come
to
the
boundary,
they
do
not
come
in.
ku's
facilities
are
inside,
they
come
to
the
boundary,
they
do
not
go
out.
that
has
been
the
historical
development
and
that
is
the
factual
situation
now.
that
is
the
corridor.
now
tva
says,
even
where
there
is
such
a
sharp
boundary
with
a
private
utility
on
one
side
and
tva
on
the
other
side
of
this
boundary,
tva
can
relate
some
undefined
part
of
its
service
area
to
a
part
of
the
private
utilities
service
area
and
then
on
the
basis
that
the
part
of
tva's
area
is
larger
than
the
selected
part
of
the
private
utilities
defined
area,
tva
can
take
this
part.now
i
know
that's
a
long
sentence.
let
me
illustrate
it
in
this
way.
if
you
would
consider
for
a
moment
the
entire
tva
service
area
of
some
80,000
square
miles,
it's
defined
let's
say.
then
consider
above
it,
ku's
entire
service
area
in
which
ku
serves
and
tva
does
not.
now,
take
the
two
and
consider
them
as
one
entirety.
tva
then
says
based
on
this
word
primary.
in
this
totality,
we're
primary
because
we're
bigger.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
bigger
and
we
don't
deny
that
tva
is
bigger
than
we
are.
and
if
you
take
their
principle,
they
would
say
that
they
could
take
our
entire
service
area
because
in
this
total,
they
are
primary.
now
that's
all
they've
done
here.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you
say,
is
there
only
dispute?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
tazewell
and
new
tazewell,
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
all
we
have
legally.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
not
answer
quite
that
limited.
it
depends
in
part
on
who
is
giving
service
there
but
i
will
accept
tva's
statement
of
the
problem
as
one
to
define
its
periphery
and
then
say
to
you
that
on
the
facts,
tva's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
its
tva's
entire
case
sir.
they
say,
the
periphery
of
their
area
is
to
be
drawn
across
the
kentucky-tennessee
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
kentucky
utilities
company?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
5%
powell
valley,
95%
ku.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
not
absolutely.
no
sir.
now
tva
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
i
think
that's
their
position
and
it
leads
you
to
this
analysis
of
how
they
get
there.
they
say
it
is
a
pocket.
factually,
it
is
not
a
pocket.
their
periphery
has
grown
on
their
own
10
maps
made
before
this
litigation
started,
there's
not
--
these
are
not
our
map
(inaudible).
their
periphery
does
not
cut
across
the
tennessee
state
line
as
they
now
do
it.
their
periphery
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
didn't
draw
it.
tva
drew
it,
excuse
me.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you're
suggesting
an
antitrust
problem
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
don't.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
there
were
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
is
--
i
will
first
preface
my
answer
by
saying,
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation
here
but
here
is
the
answer
to
your
question.
this
act
accepts
from
tva's
prohibition
against
service,
12
named
municipalities
and
says
that
despite
the
prohibition,
you
can
serve
this
12.
eight
of
the
12
are
equally
within
and
completely
surrounded
by
tva
service.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
reason
for
this
provision
that
says
to
tva,
you
can
go
serve
this
eight
surrounded
by
your
service
area
if
they
could
do
it
anyway.
the
tva
says,
this
just
came
about
by
accident.
that's
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
these
communities
were
added
just
before
the
bill
was
finally
adopted
in
its
last
stages
in
the
senate
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir,
and
if
that
were
not
so,
there
are
some
80,000
private
utility
customers
that
tva
could
take.
that
was
all
pointed
out
in
the
legislative
history.
but
once
again,
the
basic
position
of
tva
here
is
that
its
periphery
and
that's
not
my
term,
its
tvas,
that
its
periphery
must
be
drawn
across
the
kentucky-tennessee
state
line.
we
say
factually
that
cannot
be
a
part
of
tva's
periphery.
when
ku
and
only
ku
have
facilities,
customers
and
service
on
both
sides
of
that
periphery,
the
periphery
must
get
down
to
exclude
ku
service
area
as
it
does
on
every
one
of
their
maps.
and
i'm
completely
neglecting
administrative
discretion.
so
far
as
administrative
discretion
is
concerned,
i
think
i'll
ignore
the
cases
and
simply
characterize
what
determination
by
the
tva
board
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
marquis
tells
you
and
they
suggest
in
their
briefs
that
we're
talking
about
a
determination
made
in
february
1960.
at
that
time,
a
meeting
was
held
among
representatives
of
the
kentucky
town
of
middlesborough,
one
man
from
tazewell,
the
tva
board
and
other
representatives
of
tva.
the
principal
subject
of
the
meeting
was
middlesborough.
at
that
time,
the
tva
board
made
no
determination
or
whatever.
it
did
not
even
make
a
statement.
mr.
mccarthy,
tva's
former
general
counsel
was
present
at
the
meeting.
and
he
told
the
district
court
that
the
tazewell
man
was
told,
“in
the
presence
of
the
tva
board”
that
there
was
no
legal
inhibition.
the
tva
board
didn't
tell
the
tazewell
man
anything.
it
didn't
make
a
determination.
that
statement
is
at
the
record
576.
there
is
no
minute
of
the
february
1960
action
of
the
tva
board
because
it
didn't
take
any.
there
was
a
memorandum
kept
by
its
director
of
power
marketing,
that's
the
only
memorandum
of
this
meeting
as
far
as
we
know
it.
he
also
said
that
tva
representatives,
not
the
tva
board
told
tazewell.
now
in
august
1961,
there
was
a
subsequent
meeting
in
which
--
with
tva
at
which
their
subject
was
discussed.
tva
was
represented
by
responsible
officials
and
including
a
lawyer
from
its
legal
department
and
at
that
meeting,
there
were
three
significant
statements
made
in
1961.
first,
due
to
present
territorial
limitations
in
the
tva
act,
it
is
not
now
believed
that
tva
power
could
be
furnished
to
cumberland
gap.
now
they
tell
you
the
periphery
should
be
drawn
so
that
they
can
serve
cumberland
gap.
1961,
they
didn't
think
so
and
the
act
is
not
been
changed.
second,
further
study
and
consideration
will
be
necessary
for
tva
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
can
supply
power
in
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
if
the
tva
board
have
resolved
that
question
in
1960,
no
further
study
would
have
been
necessary
in
1961.
any
consideration
of
administrative
discretion
in
this
case
has
to
be
confined
to
action
which
the
tva
board
did
take
on
august
26,
1964.
the
defendant
started
taking
our
customers
in
october
1963.
the
lawsuit
was
filed
november
1963.
on
august
12,
1964,
five
weeks
before
trial
of
the
action
in
the
district
court,
we
took
the
deposition
of
mr.
wesnar
(ph),
tva's
manager
of
power.
in
that
deposition,
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
admitted
that
he
did
not
even
know
where
the
cumberland
gap
was
in
claiborne
county,
tennessee.
more
significantly,
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
admitted
that
tva
had
not
undertaken
to
locate
its
boundary
as
related
to
claiborne
county
and
then
he
did
not
even
know
how
you
would
go
about
fixing
that
boundary.
that
testimony
in
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
deposition
on
august
12,
1964,
undoubtedly
suggested
two
things
to
those
in
tva
in
charge
of
the
conduct
of
this
lawsuit.
first,
it
suggested
a
weakness
in
their
position
in
the
lawsuit.
they
have
determined
that
they
could
take
the
tazewells
but
they
have
not
fixed
the
periphery
which
they
now
say
is
all
important.
second,
it
undoubtedly
occurred
to
them
that
an
administrative
discretion
defense
could
be
developed
because
in
the
two
weeks
following,
mr.
wesnar's
(ph)
deposition,
they
prepared
two
memoranda
for
the
tva
board.
and
on
august
26,
1964,
tva
made
it
only
determine
--
tva
board
made
the
only
determination
it
ever
made
in
this
matter.
that
determination
was
made
nine
and
one
half
months
after
the
suit
have
been
filed.
it
was
made
two
weeks
after
mr.
wesnar's
(ph)
deposition
and
it
was
made
three
and
one
half
weeks
before
trial
of
the
action
in
the
district
court.
the
sixth
circuit
course
--
court
twice
accurately
characterized
this
determination
as
having
been
“adopted”
to
sustain
its
position
in
this
lawsuit
and
second,
as
made
for
the
purpose
and
on
the
eve
of
trial
and
it
unquestionably
was.
tva
says
that
in
this
case,
so
much
expertise,
knowledge
and
information,
is
necessary
that
its
board
is
the
only
one
who
could
make
this
determination
fixing
its
periphery.
as
i
say,
the
board
determination
was
made
nine
and
a
half
months
after
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed.
interrogatories,
depositions
had
been
exchanged
and
taken.
all
of
the
map
exhibits
have
been
exchanged.
a
wealth
of
information
including
the
more
than
hundred
exhibits
in
this
file
had
been
developed
and
it
was
known
to
everybody.
the
tva
board
was
given
a
very
minute
fraction
of
that
information
although
it
was
readily
available
and
it
made
its
determination.
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
and
tva's
then
general
counsel
each
in
their
two
memoranda
acknowledged
that
there
are
two
areas
in
the
county
where
ku
and
only
ku
has
served.
one
over
here
in
(inaudible)
in
the
west
part
of
the
county,
another
one
harrogate,
(inaudible),
cumberland
gap,
customer
south
of
the
powell
river
which
is
in
our
corridor
crosses
it
and
the
tazewells.
despite
having
acknowledged
those
facts
as
to
service
area,
tva's
general
counsel,
his
memorandum
includes
the
following.
the
closer
question
is
whether
the
periphery
should
be
drawn
to
include
all
of
claiborne
county
or
should
dip
down
to
exclude
mingle
hollow
and
again
to
exclude
the
area
in
the
vicinity
of
cumberland
gap,
having
acknowledged
the
fact
that
he
then
said
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
board
to
decide.
well,
it
isn't
a
matter
for
the
board
to
decide.
it's
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
where
their
area
was
and
they
went
through
the
motion
and
made
a
determination
as
the
sixth
circuit
repeatedly
stated
contrary
to
the
fact.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
(inaudible)
alright
sir,
we
had
understood
that
their
principal
reliance
was
on
administrative
discretion
rather
than
standing.on
standing
to
sue
and
i
think
the
basic
premise
for
all
of
these
is
that
the
1959
statute
was
enacted
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
private
utilities.
this
question
of
standing
under
this
particular
statute
has
been
before
six
federal
judges.
the
four
who
heard
this
case,
judge
henry
brooks
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky
and
judge
smith
in
georgia.
each
of
the
six
has
concluded
without
question,
without
dissent
that
standing
exists.
judge
brooks
on
that
matter
of
purpose
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
leaves
no
doubt
but
that
the
provision
was
passed
for
the
protection
of
private
utilities.
the
sixth
circuit
said
the
same
thing.
i
think
rather
than
what
tva
does
not
really
dispute
at
that
point,
it's
acknowledged
in
effect
on
its
brief.
i
would
come
to
what
i
think
to
be
their
prin
--
would
you
like
the
citation,
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
they
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
they
press
the
point
of
standing
but
not
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
the
underlying
matter
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
on
page
10
of
their
current
brief,
they
acknowledge,
to
be
sure
a
desire
to
afford
some
protection
to
adjoining
utilities
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
factors.
and
then
they
say,
a
purpose
to
protect
is
not
the
equivalent
of
the
creation
of
a
private
right.
they
acknowledge
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
now
all
of
the
judges
have
found
that
as
i
say
all
six
have
found
standing.
i
think
tva's
basic
argument
on
standing
to
sue
is
what
we
consider
to
be
a
definitely
superficial
argument.
you're
all
familiar
with
the
decisions
in
alabama
power
against
ickes
and
the
other
electric
utility
standing
cases
where
the
plaintiffs
were
really
challenging
some
underlying
loan
activity.
they
were
--
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
who
were
challenging
the
propriety
or
legality
of
the
actions
of
the
lending
officials
to
make
the
loans
or
the
funds.
and
the
courts
in
those
cases
said,
the
plaintiffs
as
to
that
matter
are
simply
members
of
the
general
public.
they
have
no
standing
to
question
the
legality
of
the
action
of
the
rea
administrator
making
a
loan,
that
character
of
defense.
now
tva
tries
to
get
under
those
cases
by
saying
that
we're
not
here
complaining
of
competition
by
tva.
we're
complaining
of
competition
by
the
cities,
by
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
and
even
powell
valley.
well,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
congress
itself
entered
that
defense.
this
statute
first
prohibits
contracts
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
the
source
of
power
supply
outside
this
described
area.
second,
to
give
even
more
certain
effect
to
its
intention,
congress
prohibited
contracts
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
directly
or
indirectly
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
its
area.
we're
not
complaining
of
competition
from
the
towns.
we're
complaining
of
tva
power
in
our
area.
that
is
the
very
thing
which
is
prohibited
by
the
1959
act.
the
act
was
enacted
for
the
very
purpose
of
protecting
the
nine
private
utilities
around
tva
by
keeping
tva
power
out
of
their
area.
the
statute
was
enacted
for
that
purpose,
it
prohibits
that
activity.
the
activity
complained
of
is
itself
here
unlawful.
the
national
bank
cases,
the
frost
case,
all
of
these
are
directly
in
point.
we
are
not
complaining
of
what
the
town
is
doing,
we're
complaining
of
what
tva
is
doing.
it's
violating
the
statute.
it's
violating
the
expressed
prohibition.
now
tva
tells
you
that
it
had
to
act
when
the
tazewells
came
to
it.
that
necessitated
action
on
its
part.
but
anytime,
anybody
comes
to
an
administrative
officer
or
agency
and
request
that
it
do
a
prohibited
act
or
do
an
act
in
excess
of
its
authority,
obviously,
it
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
exceed
to
that
request.
and
the
necessity
of
making
that
character
of
the
decision,
certainly
does
not
make
the
decision
binding
on
the
courts
if
in
fact
it
is
exceeding
its
authority,
if
in
fact,
it
is
acting
contrary
to
an
expressed
prohibition
in
the
statute.
i
think
in
all
the
standing
cases,
the
most
significant
question
that
the
court
asked
is
whether
the
statute
in
question
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
plaintiff
or
a
small
class
of
which
the
plaintiff
was
a
party
or
for
the
purpose
of
simply
--
some
broad
pronouncement
of
congressional
policy.
if
the
former
situation
is
concluded
to
be
the
fact
as
to
the
statute
than
an
individual
injured
by
a
violation
of
the
statute
has
standing
to
enforce
the
statutory
provision.
as
that
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
have
to
answer
you
this
way.
i
don't
know
any
single
case
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
there
is
no
standing
when
these
things
exist
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
first,
we
have
a
charge
that
the
competition
complained
of
is
itself
unlawful.
second,
the
very
competition
in
question
not
just
some
remote
underlying
activity
is
expressly
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
third,
the
statute
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
plaintiff
in
litigation
against
the
very
act
complained
of.
now,
i'm
--
had
not
found
any
case
where
those
elements
were
present
where
standing
was
denied.
on
standing,
tva
makes
one
other
point.
they
say
that
because
the
statute
is
silent,
it
does
not
give
an
express
right
of
civil
action
non-exists.
i
think
on
that,
we
just
simply
cite
to
you
this
court's
decision
in
stark
against
wickard
where
the
court
held
that
where
all
of
the
element
of
standing
exist,
the
right,
the
violation,
certainly
where
its
--
one
expressly
prohibited
by
statute.
there's
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
statutory
provision
even
though
the
statute
is
silent.
i
would
like
in
the
remaining
couple
of
minutes
to
go
back
and
make
plain
what
i
think
to
be
the
key
matter
on
the
merits
which
i
don't
believe
have
managed
to
make
claim
yet
--
i
think
i
failed
in
that.
tva
says
that
somehow
by
use
of
this
word
primary,
it
may
go
--
it
may
draw
its
periphery
out
somewhere
beyond
the
outermost
limits
where
its
facilities
and
customers
and
those
of
its
distributors
exist.
it
says
that
it
may
include
within
its
area,
facilities
and
customers
of
another
utility
because
of
the
word
primary.
that
word
primary
came
in
the
statute,
clearly
under
the
legislative
history
for
this
reason
where
lines
of
--
an
adjacent
utility
and
those
of
tva
distributors
in
fact
interlace
in
the
manner
indicated.
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
boundary
at
any
location
without
including
facilities
and
customers
are
one
in
the
service
area
of
the
other.
that's
what
primary
means.
here,
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation.
we
have
a
sharp
boundary
with
tva
and
its
distributors
on
one
side
and
ku
on
the
other
throughout
this
entire
--
i'm
reluctant
to
use
the
word
corridor,
peninsula
of
service
area.
where
that
situation
exist,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
words
of
the
statute
which
would
permit
tva
to
go
beyond
the
outermost
area
where
it
has
facilities
and
customers
and
relate
a
part
of
our
area
by
use
of
this
word
primary
and
take
it.
i'm
sure
that
you
always
hear
from
every
respondent
that
the
circuit
court
decided
the
case
directly
and
gave
it
utmost
care
and
attention.
we
feel
very
earnestly
that
that's
true
in
this
case.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
eight
other
utilities
whose
service
areas
like
ours
adjoin
tva,
has
joined
with
us.
they
all
join
with
me
in
this
plea
that
you
leave
intact
this
decision
which
we
feel
is
the
only
way
of
giving
meaning
to
the
protection,
the
needed
protection
which
congress
enacted
for
our
benefit.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
what
we
believe
to
be
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
i
want
to
respond
briefly
to
mr.
stanifer's
statement
on
behalf
of
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
unless
tva
is
to
be
permitted
to
expand
its
service
to
include
the
entire
country,
there
must
always
be
a
border
between
tva
on
the
one
hand
and
investor
owned
utilities
on
the
other.
that
border
will
always
be
a
top
situation.
the
investor
owned
utilities
and
i
do
not
propose
to
get
into
the
philosophy
of
public
against
private
power
but
the
investor
owned
utilities
cannot
pay
federal
and
state
income
taxes
in
the
full
capital
cost
of
their
facilities
and
still
sell
power
as
cheaply
as
tva.
there
are
two
alternatives.
one
is
to
give
this
tax
free
power
to
whatever
group
happens
to
be
just
outside
the
current
border,
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
if
you
do
that,
you
have
not
eliminated
the
border
problems.
you
simply
push
them
back
to
another
area
where
they
will
reoccur
next
year,
a
different
group.
the
second
alternative
is
to
draw
a
boundary
as
of
some
given
time
and
say
that's
it.
that's
as
far
as
we're
going
to
let
it
go.
in
the
1959
statute,
congress
adopted
the
second
alternative.
again,
in
1966
when
jackson
purchase
went
back
to
congress
and
said
that
we're
just
outside
the
boundary.
we
have
the
same
intolerable
situation
which
the
cities
have
described
this
morning,
making
exception
for
us,
congress
said
no.
we
drew
the
boundary
in
the
1959
act
and
we're
going
to
adhere
to
it.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
kentucky
utilities
exchanges
power
with
tva
at
a
number
of
points,
one
of
them
being
here
at
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
do
not
buy
power
from
tva.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
one
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
there's
a
very
little
on
that.
the
exchange
works
out
--
i'm
not
in
the
position
where
i
can
answer
the
question
but
it
is
a
pay
back
of
power.
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
pay
back
actually,
tva
uses
more
of
our
power
than
we
use
of
theirs.
we
exchange
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
didn't
understand
the
first
word.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
that's
not
the
point
of
our
exchanges
with
tva.
there
are
areas
in
which
we
have
transmission
facilities
available
where
tva
loads
grew.
in
those
areas,
we
supply
power
for
the
account
of
tva.
there
are
reversed
areas
where
they
have
transmission
available
for
our
loads
grew
and
they
supply
power
for
our
account.
there
is
no
difference
in
base
load
and
peaking
power.
and
if
i
--
as
i
say
it,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
on
the
facts,
the
exchange
is
virtually
equal.
we
are
not
customers
of
tva.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
i
know
the
point
of
your
question
and
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright
sir.
we
had
understood
that
there
were
three
issues
in
this
case
and
i'm
really
genuinely
baffled
by
mr.
marquis'
statement
of
the
issues.
he
did
not
seem
to
me
to
state
an
issue
on
the
merits.
we
have
felt
that
the
three
issues
we're
standing
to
sue
the
substantive
question
on
the
merits
and
administrative
discretion.
what
effect
is
to
give
to
the
so-called
termination
by
the
tva
board?
particularly
in
this
case,
administrative
discretion
cannot
be
considered
apart
from
the
facts.
so
i
would
propose
to
discuss
the
facts
and
the
substantive
question
on
the
merits
first.
that
question
is,
are
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
to
which
electric
service
admittedly
is
being
supplied
by
ku
on
july
1,
1957
outside
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
that
date.
i
would
emphasize
that
there
is
no
dispute
in
any
basic
operative
fact
in
the
case.
for
example,
ku
on
the
statutory
date
supply,
95%
of
the
customers
sold
95%
of
the
power
consumed
in
the
towns.
powell
valley
in
contrast
had
a
few
customers
in
the
eastern
edge
of
the
towns.powell
valley's
lines
in
the
rural
area
had
extended
in
to
the
eastern
edge.
this
map
which
is
exhibit
b
shows
customers
not
as
of
the
statutory
date
but
as
of
april
1964.
there
is
another
map,
exhibit
25,
which
shows
the
customers
as
of
the
july
1,
1957
statutory
date.
ku
was
virtually
the
sole
supplier
of
power
in
the
tazewells.
i
would
like
to
state
the
substantive
question
in
tva
terms
in
an
indirect
discussion
of
the
facts
to
it.
tva,
general
counsel
--
former
general
counsel,
stated
the
question
as
follows
to
the
district
court
and
this
continues
to
be
mr.
marquis
statement
of
it.
it
is
the
periphery
of
the
area,
the
tva
area
that
is
not
defined.
that
is
really
the
job
to
determine
where
the
periphery
is.
does
it
go
across
the
straight
line
or
does
it
dip
down
into
to
tennessee.
now
mr.
marquis
discussed
with
you
some
exceptions
to
the
basic
primary
area
section
of
the
statute.
we
discussed
them
in
our
brief,
we
differ
with
them,
with
tva.
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
them
this
morning
because
of
time
limitations
and
because
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
generating
plant.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
does
your
assumption
include
customers
ku
had
a
generating
plant
and
served
customers
at
a
defined
area?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
--
that
is
where
we
differ
with
tva.
if
that
situation
existed
where
we
were
completely
surrounded
by
tva
service
in
island
well
within
that
territory,
it's
our
interpretation
of
the
act.
i
think
it
supported
the
legislative
history.
we
so
urge
in
our
brief
that
tva
could
not
take
that
service
area.
that's
the
point
of
difference.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
line
matter
because
that
is
not
the
situation
presented
by
this
case
if
your
honor
please.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
emphasize
that
tva
does
not
claim
that
this
is
the
island
situation.
all
we
differ
on
what
the
result
would
be
if
it
were.
tva
says
in
its
own
statement
of
the
question
--
of
the
periphery
dips
down
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
and
tva
--
if
tva
is
wrong
in
that
position,
if
the
tazewells
and
new
tazewells
are
not
thus
within
tva's
primary
area
defined
by
that
dipping
periphery,
then
tva
would
concede
that
it
cannot
take
the
tazewells.
so
that's
why
--
i'm
not
going
to
get
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
difference,
i'm
going
to
discuss
where
the
periphery
goes
because
if
we're
correct
in
that
and
the
circuit
court
so
held
in
tva
by
its
own
statement
of
the
law
loses
on
the
merits.
tva
would
have
you
believe
that
the
tazewells
are
these
islands.
if
they're
connected
in
our
service
area
only
by
the
transmission
line
which
extends
up
into
kentucky,
that
is
not
the
case.
i
want
to
talk
about
several
towns
in
tennessee,
the
tennessee
state
line
and
the
tazewells.
and
you
can
only
consider
those
matters
in
relation
to
each
other
by
reference
to
a
map.
this
map
that
i
have
is
the
map
which
was
attached
to
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion.
it's
a
so-called
tva
demerit
map.
it's
found
in
your
record
at
page
771.
it
is
the
ku
area
is
shaded
here
to
make
it
more
apparent.
this
map
was
made
not
by
ku
but
by
tva
in
1952.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
may
i
answer
that?
i'm
going
to
answer
it
in
detail.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
that's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
exactly
where
i'm
headed.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
in
kentucky,
just
north
of
the
tennessee
state
line,
kentucky
utilities
has
the
only
service
there.
tva
and
its
distributors
have
none.
there
is
a
kentucky
town
of
middlesborough
which
is
almost
on
the
state
line.
coming
on
down
in
the
northern
tennessee,
you
find
the
tennessee
towns.
now,
all
of
these
are
tennessee
communities.
cumberland
gap,
harrogate,
off
to
the
west,
(inaudible)
up
at
the
eastern
corner
shawanee,
five
miles
down
south
of
cumberland
gap,
arthur.
kentucky
utilities
is
the
only
utility
which
has
any
facilities,
customers
or
service
in
these
towns
and
in
all
of
the
area
between
them.
tva
and
its
distributors
do
not
have
any
facilities,
customers
or
service
in
the
area
i've
described.
in
this
corridor
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
something
different,
if
you've
ever
driven
through
this
part
of
the
mountains
down
there
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
it's
quite
a
bit
different.
now
in
this
corridor
which
they
would
again
have
you
believe
as
a
transmission
line,
ku
has
a
69,000
volt
major
transmission
line,
a
substation,
100
miles
of
12,000
volt
distribution
lines
which
is
shown
off
here
in
red
and
all
of
the
other
secondary
line,
services
and
other
facilities
which
are
not
shown
on
here
to
serve
about
2000
customers
in
that
county.
on
july
1,
1957,
ku
supplied
service
in
the
corridor
outside
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
to
1278
customers.
when
the
litigation
began,
powell
valley's
manager
undertook
to
make
a
map
for
using
that
litigation
on
which
you
would
show
individual
ku
customers.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
tva
and
said,
“i
cannot
do
it
because
of
the
density
on
ku's
system.”
this
corridor
is
not
empty.
it
is
not
a
transmission
line.
if
you
would
refer
to
map
exhibit
37
at
record
772
as
well
as
this
map,
exhibit
38,
you
would
see
that
ku's
facilities
fill
and
served
all
parts
of
this
corridor.
the
tazewells
are
not
islands.
they
are
not
isolated
from
the
rest
of
our
service
area.
they
are
an
integral
part
of
that
service
area
and
the
service
area
as
shown
on
this
map
continues
on
up
into
and
as
a
part
of
our
contiguous
service
area
up
in
kentucky.
on
the
map,
you
would
see
u.s.
highway
25e
running
from
harrogate
down
to
the
tazewells.
tazewell
on
the
map
is
near
the
hill
of
the
boot
and
new
tazewell
is
further
down
to
something
i
suppose
would
be
the
instep.
in
addition
to
this
matter,
the
tva
demerit
map
which
they
criticize
was
having
been
made
in
1952.
there
are
in
this
record
10
other
maps.
they
are
exhibits
26
through
35.
each
one
of
the
10
maps
was
made
by
tva,
made
published
and
distributed
by
it,
not
by
kentucky
utilities
company.
these
maps,
the
10
others
are
dated
variously
in
1956,
a
year
before
the
significant
date
in
the
statute
and
then
in
each
of
the
year
successively
through
1963.
four
of
these
10
other
tva
maps
were
made
after
this
act
became
effective
in
1959.
they
were
thus
made
at
a
time
when
everyone
knew
the
significance
of
putting
a
service
area
boundary
on
a
map.
every
one
of
these
10
maps
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no
sir.
this
--
or
the
corridor
was
put
on
here
in
1952,
the
base
map
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
are
you
looking
at
exhibit
36
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that
--
that's
the
time
the
base
map
was
made.
the
tva
engineer
who
drew
this,
mr.
demerit
used
that
base
map
and
then
he
drew
this
corridor
on
here
in
19
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
i
--
i
can't.
oh
yes,
i
see
down
there.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
evidence
says
the
letter
from
mr.
demerit,
dated
in
1952
in
which
he
indicates
that
he
used
a
base
map.
it
was
dated
1945.
this
base
map
was
not
drawn
to
show
the
corridor.
he
used
that
map
in
1952
and
sent
the
map
with
a
letter
which
says
i'm
attaching
a
map
made
up
of
our
lc
7000
series
of
distribution
maps.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
letter
is
part
of
the
exhibit
36.
the
letter
is
on
page
769
of
the
record.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
everyone
of
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
he
refers
to
it
as
an
area
now
served
by
ku.
it
means
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
everything
that's
on
this
map
except
the
dark
shading
was
there.
as
you
look
at
the
map
in
your
record,
everything
was
on
there
as
you
see
it
when
we
received
it.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
nothing
except
to
the
letter.
mr.
demerit
did
not
testify.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
what
you
mean
by
explain
the
corridor.
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
not
by
law
but
i
will
come
to
facts
that
indicate
it
was
our
recognized
territory,
recognized
by
the
defendants
themselves.
i
think
your
question
would
be
answered
or
--
each
of
these
10
other
maps
that
i've
referred
to
made
by
tva
dated
1956
through
1963
reports
to
show
the
service
area
of
tva
and
its
distributors,
each
indicates
as
an
exception
to
the
tva
service
area,
the
same
corridor.
each
of
these
maps
shows
the
tva
periphery
to
dip
down
in
the
manner
shown
on
this
demerit
map
and
to
exclude
that
geographic
area
from
the
tva
service
area
as
defined
on
these
maps.
there
are
other
acknowledgments
by
the
defendants
that
this
was
our
service
area.
in
1952
and
in
1958,
ku
and
powell
valley,
the
tva
distributor
entered
into
territorial
agreement
so
referred
to
by
the
defendants
throughout
their
correspondents,
supplementing
and
implementing
the
1958
agreement
and
i
hope
mr.
justice
fortas
that
this
may
answer
your
question.
in
1960,
representative
--
a
representative
of
powell
valley,
the
tva
distributor
and
a
representative
of
ku
went
on
the
ground.they
took
a
very
detailed
coast
and
geodetic
survey
map
which
is
in
evidence
as
exhibit
14
and
they
drew
of
the
map
is
entitled.
the
map
showing
agreed
territorial
boundary
lines
between
ku
and
powell
valley
in
tennessee.
the
legends
on
the
maps
are
shaded
area
that
designates
ku
territory.
this
map
was
made
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it's
(inaudible)
on
exhibit
14
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it's
exhibit
14
sir.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
entire
map
was
reprinted,
parts
of
it
i
think.
this
is
the
so-called
roe-osborn
map
because
those
are
the
names
of
the
two
men
who
made
it.
the
portion
around
the
tazewells
is
sheet
4(b)
of
exhibit
14.
the
map
however
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it's
on
this
large
map
volume.
on
the
roe-osborn
map
--
on
this
coast
and
geodetic
survey
map,
these
two
men
went
out
and
marked
in
minute
detail
the
boundaries.
this
map
is
so
detailed
that
it
shows
such
things
as
cemeteries,
knobs,
ponds,
ridges,
roads,
schools,
churches,
every
individual
features.
the
roe-osborn
map
shows
the
boundary
between
ku
and
powell
valley
to
start
up
in
this
area
much
like
the
tva
demerit
map
that
then
continued
down
to
this
point
where
there
is
a
single
line
crossing
which
i'll
mention
again
in
a
moment.
it
then
includes
within
the
ku
territory,
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
and
continues
up
to
a
point
about
here
midway
up.
now
the
boundary
on
the
roe-osborn
map
stops
at
that
point
because
the
area
above
it
on
the
northwest
is
served
la
follette
rather
than
powell
valley.
ku
and
la
follette
had
no
controversy
so
the
boundary
was
not
defined
here.
there's
a
waiving
cross
patched
line
just
to
get
somebody
to
the
corridor.
the
boundary
is
defined
all
down
the
east
around
the
tazewell
and
the
new
tazewell
from
about
half
way
up
by
this
roe-osborn
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
these
divisions
of
territory
constitutes
acknowledgments
by
the
defendants
themselves
that
this
was
territory
supplied
by
ku
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
and
therefore
was
not
supplied
by
tva.
it
cannot
be
considered
within
tva's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
not
saying
they're
binding
in
a
contractual
sense,
i'm
saying
they
constitute
evidence
as
to
where
the
services
were.
they
constitute
acknowledgements.
tva
itself
has
no
service
area.
it
does
not
supply
customers
except
for
a
few
large
industrial
loads.
each
area
is
the
area
of
its
distributors.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
la
follette.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
map
was
drawn
to
show
only
the
boundary
between
ku
and
powell
valley.
it
was
not
located
between
la
follette.
this
is
a
mountainous
area,
the
la
follette
facilities
run
to
a
point
about
here.
there
has
never
been
any
controversy
with
la
follette.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
not.
i
think
it
services
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
county.
i
don't
think
it
supplies
any
in
the
immediate
area
of
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
this
map
right
here?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
was
this
the
map
that
you
referred
to?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
those
are
substantially
the
boundaries.
this
map
is
not
drawn
in
the
detail
of
the
roe-osborn
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
so
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
are
you
saying
the
outer
boundaries
of
this
shaded
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
tva's
facilities
run
to
the
border
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
of
that
shaded
area
and
did
not
come
in
with
one
exception.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
they
did
not
serve
in
that
area.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
except
as
i
say
what
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
no
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
tva
does
not
claim
a
right
to
take
any
territory
in
this
case
by
reason
of
the
five-mile
periphery
provision
because
that
says
that
they
cannot
take
any
power
--
cannot
take
any
part
of
a
municipality
serve
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you're
--
and
here
outside
the
tazewell?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright.
now,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
but
the
answer
to
it
is
this.
the
five-mile
periphery
does
not
say
to
tva,
“you
can
take
anything
you
want
around
the
five
miles
without
a
basis.”
the
five-mile
periphery
was
because
there
were
some
towns
near
the
border
inside
tva
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
congress
that
those
towns
might
expand
outside
the
periphery.
so
the
five-mile
says,
you
can
go
for
up
to
five
miles
as
necessary.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
act
because
they
can
only
do
that
mr.
justice
white.
they
can
only
do
it
if
necessary
to
care
for
growth
of
their
distributors
within
the
primary
area.
that's
the
statutory
language.
it
does
not
say
you
can
expand
anywhere
you
want
to
for
five
miles
outside
of
a
municipality.
it
says
as
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
one
of
your
distributors
in
your
primary
area.
here,
tva
--
if
powell
valley
had
a
facility
outside
this
corridor
and
simply
wanted
to
go
take
a
customer,
that
would
not
be
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
powell
valley.
if
there
were
a
city
outside
that
corridor
that
grew
over
the
line,
annexed
territory,
yes,
that's
the
legislative
history
of
what
that
section
was
designed
to
correct.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
roe-osborn
map
made
jointly
between
ku
and
tva
as
distributor
of
powell
valley
delineates
the
boundary.
there
is
no
contract.
there
were
two
letter
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
between
ku
and
powell
valley.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
tva
did
not
agree
to
the
making
of
the
map.
i
do
not
know
that
it
knew
of
the
making
with
the
map.
it
was
made
by
tva's
distributor,
powell
valley
that
had
the
service
and
ku.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
don't
think
it
disputes
the
fact
set
out
in
the
map
but
it
did
not
agree
in
the
sense
of
contractual
--
or
didn't
participate
in
the
making
of
the
map.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
a
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer
because
part
of
our
position
in
this
lawsuit
is
that
they
offer
you
no
standard.
they
say
that
if
--
that
their
board
can
fix
the
periphery,
they
say
first
that
the
job
is
to
draw
the
periphery
and
then
they
say
that
the
board
can
draw
the
periphery
as
we
say
without
relation
to
fact.
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
we
have
pointed
in
this
record
the
facts
which
showed
very
sharply
what
the
division
is.
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
it
is
a
matter
of
fact.
i
do
not
know
any
other
word
to
establish
a
utility's
boundary
other
than
in
relation
to
where
it
has
facilities
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
in
customers.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
ku
and
tva?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
far
as
i
know,
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
on
the
boundary
in
this
particular
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
other
than
as
powell
valley
is
a
representative
of
tva,
i
would
have
to
say
no.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
there
are
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
evidence
as
to
the
location
of
facilities,
customers
and
service
on
the
date
of
the
act
and
that's
the
only
way
i
know
to
fix
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you
just
say,
--
is
it
my
claiming
that
the
act
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
oh,
i
missed
that.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes,
precisely.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
so.
i
have
to
let
them
--
except
as
i
say
they
have
discretion
to
put
it
almost
anywhere
they
want
to
without
relation
to
facts
as
to
facilities
and
customers
which
discretion
we
do
not
find
anywhere
in
the
act.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
to
the
boundary,
i
would
say
no.
the
trial
court
brought
a
lengthy
opinion
in
which
he
recited
all
of
the
physical
facts
pretty
accurately
and
again
may
i
emphasize
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
alright.
may
i
again,
i
emphasize
to
both
of
you
that
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
the
physical
facts
as
to
where
we
have
facilities,
where
they
had
facilities,
where
we
have
customers
and
they
have
customers.
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
that
character
of
fact.
after
the
trial
court
accurately
reciting
those
facts
as
to
service,
he
then
in
about
three
paragraphs
expressed
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
the
tazewells.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
did
not
intend
to
exclude
the
tazewells.
there's
difference
between
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
as
to
con
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
broadly,
yes,
but
as
to
the
tazewells,
congress
had
no
intention.
you
can
read
the
legislative
history.
the
tazewells
are
not
mentioned.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
mr.
justice,
we
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no.
not
as
to
the
facts.
we
completely
agree
where
we
had
service
and
where
we
had
facilities.
tva
does
not
disagree
with
us
on
that
character
of
fact.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
we
say
that
it
does
and
perhaps,
i
should
come
now
to
a
statement
of
the
basic
issue
between
them.
that's
where
we're
headed.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright
sir.
it
is
ku's
position
that
when
you
define
the
primary
service
area
of
tva
or
any
other
utility
you
can
only
do
so
in
relation
to
facilities
and
customers
on
whatever
the
given
date
is.
that
is
done
if
that
standard
is
accepted,
there's
no
question
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
the
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
exactly
what
the
1959
act
does.
it
says,
there
shall
not
be
anymore
extension
--
expansion
where
you
have
a
service
area
today,
that
is
it.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
1959
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
act
itself?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
find
the
page?
i
can
quote
it
for
you.
it
says,
“tva,
substituting
tva
for
the
corporation
shall
make
no
contracts
for
the
sale
or
delivery
of
power
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
the
area,
outside
the
area
for
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
the
area
for
which
tva
or
its
distributors
were
the
primary
source
of
power
supply
on
july
1,
1957.
that's
the
statutory
language.
now
tva
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
and
such
additional
area
as
maybe
necessary,
your
honor
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
are
on
the
first
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
(inaudible)
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
alright.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
page
43
of
the
government's
--
and
such
additional
area
extending
not
more
than
five
miles
around
the
periphery
of
such
area
and
here
is
the
language
i
was
basing
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
on,
as
maybe
necessary
to
care
for
the
growth
of
the
corporation
and
its
distributors
within
said
primary
area.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
that
five
mile
provision
is
also
subject
to
itself
to
an
exception
that
it
cannot
include
any
part
of
any
area,
any
municipality
served
by
another
source
and
that
would
be
the
tazewells.
so
tva
does
not
base
any
claim.
it
disclaims
any
right
under
this
provision
we're
just
now
reading.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
say
not
the
former.
the
sixth
circuit
indicated
some
doubt
as
to
whether
judge
taylor
had
given
particular
weight
to
the
tva
board
determination.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
all
through
the
trial
of
this
action
however,
judge
taylor
indicated
clearly
that
he
was
deciding
this
case
de
novo.
tva
recognized
that
when
it
went
to
the
sixth
circuit,
tva
and
its
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit
stated
the
questions
whether
the
district
court
answered
yes,
we
answer
no
type.
but
if
the
statement
in
tva's
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit
was,
is
the
district
court
after
this
board
determination
to
try
this
matter
de
novo
and
they
said,
the
district
court
answered
the
matter,
yes,
we
think
no,
we
should
not
try
de
novo.
now
the
sixth
circuit
indicated
as
i
say,
some
doubt
as
to
what
judge
taylor
had
done,
what
he
meant
by
the
language
you've
quoted.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
think
judge
taylor
--
well,
i
know
judge
taylor
made
his
independent
determination
because
he
indicated
very
clearly
earlier
in
his
opinion
as
well
as
throughout
the
trial
that
he
was
going
to
decide
this
case
de
novo
and
he
did
not
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
finding
by
the
tva
board.
and
i
think
he
supported
his
decision
by
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
tva
board.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
his
conclusion
was
that
he
did
not
make
a
factual
determination
that
they
fail
within
any
periphery.
his
conclusion
was,
yes,
that
they
were
in
the
primary
area.
and
the
circuit
court,
the
sixth
circuit
said,
if
that
is
to
be
construed
as
a
finding
of
fact,
it
was
clearly
erroneous
and
such
it
is
we
submit
to
you.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
black
because
there
is
a
very
key
issue
here
that
would
not
been
able
to
develop.
what
is
tva's
position
as
to
how
its
primary
area
is
to
be
determined?
tva
says
that
even
where
there
is
a
sharp,
well-defined
boundary
as
there
is
here
and
i
would
emphasize
to
mr.
justice
fortas
what
we
mean
by
the
corridor.
powell
valley's
lines
come
to
the
boundary,
they
do
not
come
in.
ku's
facilities
are
inside,
they
come
to
the
boundary,
they
do
not
go
out.
that
has
been
the
historical
development
and
that
is
the
factual
situation
now.
that
is
the
corridor.
now
tva
says,
even
where
there
is
such
a
sharp
boundary
with
a
private
utility
on
one
side
and
tva
on
the
other
side
of
this
boundary,
tva
can
relate
some
undefined
part
of
its
service
area
to
a
part
of
the
private
utilities
service
area
and
then
on
the
basis
that
the
part
of
tva's
area
is
larger
than
the
selected
part
of
the
private
utilities
defined
area,
tva
can
take
this
part.now
i
know
that's
a
long
sentence.
let
me
illustrate
it
in
this
way.
if
you
would
consider
for
a
moment
the
entire
tva
service
area
of
some
80,000
square
miles,
it's
defined
let's
say.
then
consider
above
it,
ku's
entire
service
area
in
which
ku
serves
and
tva
does
not.
now,
take
the
two
and
consider
them
as
one
entirety.
tva
then
says
based
on
this
word
primary.
in
this
totality,
we're
primary
because
we're
bigger.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
bigger
and
we
don't
deny
that
tva
is
bigger
than
we
are.
and
if
you
take
their
principle,
they
would
say
that
they
could
take
our
entire
service
area
because
in
this
total,
they
are
primary.
now
that's
all
they've
done
here.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you
say,
is
there
only
dispute?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
tazewell
and
new
tazewell,
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
that's
all
we
have
legally.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
not
answer
quite
that
limited.
it
depends
in
part
on
who
is
giving
service
there
but
i
will
accept
tva's
statement
of
the
problem
as
one
to
define
its
periphery
and
then
say
to
you
that
on
the
facts,
tva's
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
its
tva's
entire
case
sir.
they
say,
the
periphery
of
their
area
is
to
be
drawn
across
the
kentucky-tennessee
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
kentucky
utilities
company?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
5%
powell
valley,
95%
ku.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
not
absolutely.
no
sir.
now
tva
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
no,
i
think
that's
their
position
and
it
leads
you
to
this
analysis
of
how
they
get
there.
they
say
it
is
a
pocket.
factually,
it
is
not
a
pocket.
their
periphery
has
grown
on
their
own
10
maps
made
before
this
litigation
started,
there's
not
--
these
are
not
our
map
(inaudible).
their
periphery
does
not
cut
across
the
tennessee
state
line
as
they
now
do
it.
their
periphery
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
didn't
draw
it.
tva
drew
it,
excuse
me.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
you're
suggesting
an
antitrust
problem
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
don't.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
there
were
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
is
--
i
will
first
preface
my
answer
by
saying,
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation
here
but
here
is
the
answer
to
your
question.
this
act
accepts
from
tva's
prohibition
against
service,
12
named
municipalities
and
says
that
despite
the
prohibition,
you
can
serve
this
12.
eight
of
the
12
are
equally
within
and
completely
surrounded
by
tva
service.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
reason
for
this
provision
that
says
to
tva,
you
can
go
serve
this
eight
surrounded
by
your
service
area
if
they
could
do
it
anyway.
the
tva
says,
this
just
came
about
by
accident.
that's
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
these
communities
were
added
just
before
the
bill
was
finally
adopted
in
its
last
stages
in
the
senate
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir,
and
if
that
were
not
so,
there
are
some
80,000
private
utility
customers
that
tva
could
take.
that
was
all
pointed
out
in
the
legislative
history.
but
once
again,
the
basic
position
of
tva
here
is
that
its
periphery
and
that's
not
my
term,
its
tvas,
that
its
periphery
must
be
drawn
across
the
kentucky-tennessee
state
line.
we
say
factually
that
cannot
be
a
part
of
tva's
periphery.
when
ku
and
only
ku
have
facilities,
customers
and
service
on
both
sides
of
that
periphery,
the
periphery
must
get
down
to
exclude
ku
service
area
as
it
does
on
every
one
of
their
maps.
and
i'm
completely
neglecting
administrative
discretion.
so
far
as
administrative
discretion
is
concerned,
i
think
i'll
ignore
the
cases
and
simply
characterize
what
determination
by
the
tva
board
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
marquis
tells
you
and
they
suggest
in
their
briefs
that
we're
talking
about
a
determination
made
in
february
1960.
at
that
time,
a
meeting
was
held
among
representatives
of
the
kentucky
town
of
middlesborough,
one
man
from
tazewell,
the
tva
board
and
other
representatives
of
tva.
the
principal
subject
of
the
meeting
was
middlesborough.
at
that
time,
the
tva
board
made
no
determination
or
whatever.
it
did
not
even
make
a
statement.
mr.
mccarthy,
tva's
former
general
counsel
was
present
at
the
meeting.
and
he
told
the
district
court
that
the
tazewell
man
was
told,
“in
the
presence
of
the
tva
board”
that
there
was
no
legal
inhibition.
the
tva
board
didn't
tell
the
tazewell
man
anything.
it
didn't
make
a
determination.
that
statement
is
at
the
record
576.
there
is
no
minute
of
the
february
1960
action
of
the
tva
board
because
it
didn't
take
any.
there
was
a
memorandum
kept
by
its
director
of
power
marketing,
that's
the
only
memorandum
of
this
meeting
as
far
as
we
know
it.
he
also
said
that
tva
representatives,
not
the
tva
board
told
tazewell.
now
in
august
1961,
there
was
a
subsequent
meeting
in
which
--
with
tva
at
which
their
subject
was
discussed.
tva
was
represented
by
responsible
officials
and
including
a
lawyer
from
its
legal
department
and
at
that
meeting,
there
were
three
significant
statements
made
in
1961.
first,
due
to
present
territorial
limitations
in
the
tva
act,
it
is
not
now
believed
that
tva
power
could
be
furnished
to
cumberland
gap.
now
they
tell
you
the
periphery
should
be
drawn
so
that
they
can
serve
cumberland
gap.
1961,
they
didn't
think
so
and
the
act
is
not
been
changed.
second,
further
study
and
consideration
will
be
necessary
for
tva
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
can
supply
power
in
tazewell
and
new
tazewell.
if
the
tva
board
have
resolved
that
question
in
1960,
no
further
study
would
have
been
necessary
in
1961.
any
consideration
of
administrative
discretion
in
this
case
has
to
be
confined
to
action
which
the
tva
board
did
take
on
august
26,
1964.
the
defendant
started
taking
our
customers
in
october
1963.
the
lawsuit
was
filed
november
1963.
on
august
12,
1964,
five
weeks
before
trial
of
the
action
in
the
district
court,
we
took
the
deposition
of
mr.
wesnar
(ph),
tva's
manager
of
power.
in
that
deposition,
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
admitted
that
he
did
not
even
know
where
the
cumberland
gap
was
in
claiborne
county,
tennessee.
more
significantly,
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
admitted
that
tva
had
not
undertaken
to
locate
its
boundary
as
related
to
claiborne
county
and
then
he
did
not
even
know
how
you
would
go
about
fixing
that
boundary.
that
testimony
in
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
deposition
on
august
12,
1964,
undoubtedly
suggested
two
things
to
those
in
tva
in
charge
of
the
conduct
of
this
lawsuit.
first,
it
suggested
a
weakness
in
their
position
in
the
lawsuit.
they
have
determined
that
they
could
take
the
tazewells
but
they
have
not
fixed
the
periphery
which
they
now
say
is
all
important.
second,
it
undoubtedly
occurred
to
them
that
an
administrative
discretion
defense
could
be
developed
because
in
the
two
weeks
following,
mr.
wesnar's
(ph)
deposition,
they
prepared
two
memoranda
for
the
tva
board.
and
on
august
26,
1964,
tva
made
it
only
determine
--
tva
board
made
the
only
determination
it
ever
made
in
this
matter.
that
determination
was
made
nine
and
one
half
months
after
the
suit
have
been
filed.
it
was
made
two
weeks
after
mr.
wesnar's
(ph)
deposition
and
it
was
made
three
and
one
half
weeks
before
trial
of
the
action
in
the
district
court.
the
sixth
circuit
course
--
court
twice
accurately
characterized
this
determination
as
having
been
“adopted”
to
sustain
its
position
in
this
lawsuit
and
second,
as
made
for
the
purpose
and
on
the
eve
of
trial
and
it
unquestionably
was.
tva
says
that
in
this
case,
so
much
expertise,
knowledge
and
information,
is
necessary
that
its
board
is
the
only
one
who
could
make
this
determination
fixing
its
periphery.
as
i
say,
the
board
determination
was
made
nine
and
a
half
months
after
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed.
interrogatories,
depositions
had
been
exchanged
and
taken.
all
of
the
map
exhibits
have
been
exchanged.
a
wealth
of
information
including
the
more
than
hundred
exhibits
in
this
file
had
been
developed
and
it
was
known
to
everybody.
the
tva
board
was
given
a
very
minute
fraction
of
that
information
although
it
was
readily
available
and
it
made
its
determination.
mr.
wesnar
(ph)
and
tva's
then
general
counsel
each
in
their
two
memoranda
acknowledged
that
there
are
two
areas
in
the
county
where
ku
and
only
ku
has
served.
one
over
here
in
(inaudible)
in
the
west
part
of
the
county,
another
one
harrogate,
(inaudible),
cumberland
gap,
customer
south
of
the
powell
river
which
is
in
our
corridor
crosses
it
and
the
tazewells.
despite
having
acknowledged
those
facts
as
to
service
area,
tva's
general
counsel,
his
memorandum
includes
the
following.
the
closer
question
is
whether
the
periphery
should
be
drawn
to
include
all
of
claiborne
county
or
should
dip
down
to
exclude
mingle
hollow
and
again
to
exclude
the
area
in
the
vicinity
of
cumberland
gap,
having
acknowledged
the
fact
that
he
then
said
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
board
to
decide.
well,
it
isn't
a
matter
for
the
board
to
decide.
it's
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
where
their
area
was
and
they
went
through
the
motion
and
made
a
determination
as
the
sixth
circuit
repeatedly
stated
contrary
to
the
fact.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
yes
sir.
(inaudible)
alright
sir,
we
had
understood
that
their
principal
reliance
was
on
administrative
discretion
rather
than
standing.on
standing
to
sue
and
i
think
the
basic
premise
for
all
of
these
is
that
the
1959
statute
was
enacted
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
private
utilities.
this
question
of
standing
under
this
particular
statute
has
been
before
six
federal
judges.
the
four
who
heard
this
case,
judge
henry
brooks
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky
and
judge
smith
in
georgia.
each
of
the
six
has
concluded
without
question,
without
dissent
that
standing
exists.
judge
brooks
on
that
matter
of
purpose
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
leaves
no
doubt
but
that
the
provision
was
passed
for
the
protection
of
private
utilities.
the
sixth
circuit
said
the
same
thing.
i
think
rather
than
what
tva
does
not
really
dispute
at
that
point,
it's
acknowledged
in
effect
on
its
brief.
i
would
come
to
what
i
think
to
be
their
prin
--
would
you
like
the
citation,
sir?
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
they
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
they
press
the
point
of
standing
but
not
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
--
the
underlying
matter
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
on
page
10
of
their
current
brief,
they
acknowledge,
to
be
sure
a
desire
to
afford
some
protection
to
adjoining
utilities
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
factors.
and
then
they
say,
a
purpose
to
protect
is
not
the
equivalent
of
the
creation
of
a
private
right.
they
acknowledge
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
now
all
of
the
judges
have
found
that
as
i
say
all
six
have
found
standing.
i
think
tva's
basic
argument
on
standing
to
sue
is
what
we
consider
to
be
a
definitely
superficial
argument.
you're
all
familiar
with
the
decisions
in
alabama
power
against
ickes
and
the
other
electric
utility
standing
cases
where
the
plaintiffs
were
really
challenging
some
underlying
loan
activity.
they
were
--
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
who
were
challenging
the
propriety
or
legality
of
the
actions
of
the
lending
officials
to
make
the
loans
or
the
funds.
and
the
courts
in
those
cases
said,
the
plaintiffs
as
to
that
matter
are
simply
members
of
the
general
public.
they
have
no
standing
to
question
the
legality
of
the
action
of
the
rea
administrator
making
a
loan,
that
character
of
defense.
now
tva
tries
to
get
under
those
cases
by
saying
that
we're
not
here
complaining
of
competition
by
tva.
we're
complaining
of
competition
by
the
cities,
by
the
towns
of
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
and
even
powell
valley.
well,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
congress
itself
entered
that
defense.
this
statute
first
prohibits
contracts
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
the
source
of
power
supply
outside
this
described
area.
second,
to
give
even
more
certain
effect
to
its
intention,
congress
prohibited
contracts
which
would
have
the
effect
of
making
tva
or
its
distributors
directly
or
indirectly
a
source
of
power
supply
outside
its
area.
we're
not
complaining
of
competition
from
the
towns.
we're
complaining
of
tva
power
in
our
area.
that
is
the
very
thing
which
is
prohibited
by
the
1959
act.
the
act
was
enacted
for
the
very
purpose
of
protecting
the
nine
private
utilities
around
tva
by
keeping
tva
power
out
of
their
area.
the
statute
was
enacted
for
that
purpose,
it
prohibits
that
activity.
the
activity
complained
of
is
itself
here
unlawful.
the
national
bank
cases,
the
frost
case,
all
of
these
are
directly
in
point.
we
are
not
complaining
of
what
the
town
is
doing,
we're
complaining
of
what
tva
is
doing.
it's
violating
the
statute.
it's
violating
the
expressed
prohibition.
now
tva
tells
you
that
it
had
to
act
when
the
tazewells
came
to
it.
that
necessitated
action
on
its
part.
but
anytime,
anybody
comes
to
an
administrative
officer
or
agency
and
request
that
it
do
a
prohibited
act
or
do
an
act
in
excess
of
its
authority,
obviously,
it
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
exceed
to
that
request.
and
the
necessity
of
making
that
character
of
the
decision,
certainly
does
not
make
the
decision
binding
on
the
courts
if
in
fact
it
is
exceeding
its
authority,
if
in
fact,
it
is
acting
contrary
to
an
expressed
prohibition
in
the
statute.
i
think
in
all
the
standing
cases,
the
most
significant
question
that
the
court
asked
is
whether
the
statute
in
question
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
plaintiff
or
a
small
class
of
which
the
plaintiff
was
a
party
or
for
the
purpose
of
simply
--
some
broad
pronouncement
of
congressional
policy.
if
the
former
situation
is
concluded
to
be
the
fact
as
to
the
statute
than
an
individual
injured
by
a
violation
of
the
statute
has
standing
to
enforce
the
statutory
provision.
as
that
--
mr.
malcolm
y.
marshall
i
would
have
to
answer
you
this
way.
i
don't
know
any
single
case
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
there
is
no
standing
when
these
things
exist
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
first,
we
have
a
charge
that
the
competition
complained
of
is
itself
unlawful.
second,
the
very
competition
in
question
not
just
some
remote
underlying
activity
is
expressly
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
third,
the
statute
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
plaintiff
in
litigation
against
the
very
act
complained
of.
now,
i'm
--
had
not
found
any
case
where
those
elements
were
present
where
standing
was
denied.
on
standing,
tva
makes
one
other
point.
they
say
that
because
the
statute
is
silent,
it
does
not
give
an
express
right
of
civil
action
non-exists.
i
think
on
that,
we
just
simply
cite
to
you
this
court's
decision
in
stark
against
wickard
where
the
court
held
that
where
all
of
the
element
of
standing
exist,
the
right,
the
violation,
certainly
where
its
--
one
expressly
prohibited
by
statute.
there's
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
statutory
provision
even
though
the
statute
is
silent.
i
would
like
in
the
remaining
couple
of
minutes
to
go
back
and
make
plain
what
i
think
to
be
the
key
matter
on
the
merits
which
i
don't
believe
have
managed
to
make
claim
yet
--
i
think
i
failed
in
that.
tva
says
that
somehow
by
use
of
this
word
primary,
it
may
go
--
it
may
draw
its
periphery
out
somewhere
beyond
the
outermost
limits
where
its
facilities
and
customers
and
those
of
its
distributors
exist.
it
says
that
it
may
include
within
its
area,
facilities
and
customers
of
another
utility
because
of
the
word
primary.
that
word
primary
came
in
the
statute,
clearly
under
the
legislative
history
for
this
reason
where
lines
of
--
an
adjacent
utility
and
those
of
tva
distributors
in
fact
interlace
in
the
manner
indicated.
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
boundary
at
any
location
without
including
facilities
and
customers
are
one
in
the
service
area
of
the
other.
that's
what
primary
means.
here,
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation.
we
have
a
sharp
boundary
with
tva
and
its
distributors
on
one
side
and
ku
on
the
other
throughout
this
entire
--
i'm
reluctant
to
use
the
word
corridor,
peninsula
of
service
area.
where
that
situation
exist,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
words
of
the
statute
which
would
permit
tva
to
go
beyond
the
outermost
area
where
it
has
facilities
and
customers
and
relate
a
part
of
our
area
by
use
of
this
word
primary
and
take
it.
i'm
sure
that
you
always
hear
from
every
respondent
that
the
circuit
court
decided
the
case
directly
and
gave
it
utmost
care
and
attention.
we
feel
very
earnestly
that
that's
true
in
this
case.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
eight
other
utilities
whose
service
areas
like
ours
adjoin
tva,
has
joined
with
us.
they
all
join
with
me
in
this
plea
that
you
leave
intact
this
decision
which
we
feel
is
the
only
way
of
giving
meaning
to
the
protection,
the
needed
protection
which
congress
enacted
for
our
benefit.
