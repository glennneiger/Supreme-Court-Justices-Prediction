mr.
william
r.
stanifer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
marquis
has
covered
the
legal
question
and
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
those.
but
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
tazewells
and
what
our
problems
are.
i
was
born
and
raised
in
new
tazewell.
now
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
are
two
small
mountainous
communities
located
in
claiborne
county,
tennessee.
in
1955,
tazewell
and
new
tazewell
incorporate
separately.
in
that
territory
incorporated
was
two
small
areas.
now
this
area
beyond
this
dark
mark
was
the
municipal
limit
of
the
town
of
tazewell.
this
dark
area
which
they
have
common
municipal
boundaries
in
this
section,
this
dark
area
was
the
municipal
boundaries
of
the
town
of
new
tazewell
--
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
new
tazewell,
tennessee.
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
the
population
on
incorporation
1955
was
approximately
1040
in
tazewell
and
approximately
700
in
new
tazewell.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
incorporation
in
1955,
there
was
tva
customers
or
two
that
are
distributors,
and
kentucky
utility
customers.
now
as
time
passed,
it
came
necessary
for
each
town
to
annex
additional
territory.
in
fact,
when
tazewell
annexed
additional
territory
about
the
year
1960,
it
over
doubled
in
size.
now
in
that
newly
annexed
territory,
there
were
more
tva
customers
annexed
than
there
were
kentucky
utilities
customers.
now,
new
tazewell
has
now
annexed
additional
territory
in
which
it
has
tripled
its
size
through
annexation
approximately
year
1960.
there
is
one
annexed
area
which
is
not
shown
on
this
exhibit,
this
exhibit
b
on
number
24
and
this
is
a
map
indicative
of
the
year
1954.
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
the
populations
today,
your
honor
are
in
tazewell,
approximately
1600
and
new
tazewell
approximately
1200
to
1300.
now,
neither
town
now
can
annex
in
any
direction
into
any
territory
without
there
have
been
more
tva
customers
than
kentucky
utility
customers.
now
in
the
1920s,
kentucky
utilities
run
a
power
line
down
to
tazewell.
and
all
that
they
have
served
is
along
the
highway,
a
small
section
on
the
highway
and
into
town.
there
are
two
distributors
of
tva
power
begins
supplying
electrical
power
to
the
rest
of
our
citizens
and
eventually
started
serving
citizens
in
the
town
in
the
south.
now,
with
these
customers
located
within
the
towns
is
that
where
our
problems
begin.
now
kentucky
utility
rates
are
approximately
2
and
a
half
times
higher
than
kentucky
utility
rates,
i
mean
the
tva
rates.
now
that
is
if
anyone
won't
use
the
electrical
power
for
your
things
except
electric
lights.
so
therefore,
no
one
wants
to
live
in
an
area
before
they
cannot
be
served
by
tva
power.
now
the
property
which
these
black
dots,
they
were
agreeing,
your
honor,
and
we
didn't
think
you
can
see
them
from
there,
so
they
were
applied.
so
that
these
are
tva
customers
located.
now
this
has
been
the
original
(inaudible).
this
is
an
annexed
area
which
resulted
in
tazewell
about
the
year
1960
which
extended
the
municipal
mandate
and
all
of
these
black
dots
are
tva
customers.
now
people
of
our
(inaudible)
that's
where
they
want
to
fail
or
their
residential
or
emerging
property,
they
said
they
don't
want
to
buy
property
that
which
they
cannot
obtain
this
power
in
due
to
the
high
rate.
now,
going
through
kentucky
utilities'
brief,
it
sounds
to
me
that
kentucky
utilities
are
trying
to
tell
this
court
that
this
is
justifiable
between
kentucky
utilities
and
tva.
well,
this
just
isn't
so.
i
don't
know
how
much
tva
cares
about
serving
the
town,
but
believe
me
the
citizens
that
happily
live
there
do
care.
ku
seems
to
ignore
the
fact
that
we're
just
not
talking
about
kentucky
utility
rights
or
ku
rights
or
the
tva
rights.
i
feel
that
the
citizens
of
those
tazewells
have
their
rights
also.
now
there
is
nothing
in
their
brief
that
indicate
that
they
recognize
that
decisions
have
been
interacted
or
that
there's
nothing
in
their
brief
where
they
indicate
their
concern
for
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
people
that
give
rise
to
these
lawsuit.
now
in
1959,
the
claiborne
county
chambers
of
commerce
was
organized
in
the
effort
to
locate
(inaudible)
to
supplement
the
low
form
of
income
which
we
had.
and
in
fact
in
1961,
claiborne
county
was
raised
most
economic
best
area
from
the
state
of
tennessee.
we
have
had
some
small
success
in
obtaining
the
industry.
in
fact,
we
have
located
three
new
small
factories.
one
is
located
in
this
area.
one
located
in
this
area.
and
one
located
in
an
area
which
then
had
been
in
new
tazewell
which
is
not
on
this
map.
and
all
three
of
those
new
small
plants,
it's
served
by
tva
power.
now
our
system
believes
that
we
are
entitled
to
tva
power
and
they
can't
understand
why
that
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
it
when
the
very
backwaters
of
the
first
dam
ever
built
by
tva
is
within
three
and
one
half
miles
of
our
municipal
boundary.
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
yes.
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
yes,
the
backwaters.
mr.
william
r.
stanifer
now
to
affirm
ku's
position
in
this
case
would
be
to
deny
our
citizens
the
freedom
of
choice
and
would
most
certainly
create
an
intolerable
situation
that
we
could
never
live
with.
they
just
doesn't
seem
fair
that
our
citizens
should
be
forced
to
live
in
such
an
unstable
situation.
thank
you
very
much.
