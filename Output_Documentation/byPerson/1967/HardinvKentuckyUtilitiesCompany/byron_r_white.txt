justice

i
would
just
like
to
aske
you
a
question
on
that
respect?
let's
assume
that
ku
had
no
transmission
line
running
into
tazewell
but
had
a
plant
there,
generating

and
that
that's
--
and
here
was
just
a
--
here
was
a
place
where
they
had
a
generating
plants
and
supplied
an
area
inside
--
with
inside
the
general
area
thereby
served
by
tva.
i
suppose
that
the
exception
would
--
the
exception
for
islands
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
would
mean
that
tva
could
sup
--
could
compete
with
you
in
those
--
in
that
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
--
and
the
--
and
so
it
is
--
if
you
would
say
the
same
--
that
would
be
no
difference
from
this
situation
where
you
have
a
line
running
in
from
outside.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
i
got
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir.
mr.
marquis
said
that
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
its
purpose.
the
map
was
sent
to
us
with
a
letter
from
tva
which
i
think
clarifies
any
question
as
to
its
purpose.
the
letter
says,
“i
am
attaching
that
made
up
of
our
lc
7000
series
of

maps,
showing
the
areas
now

and
ku
where
in
the
cumberland
gap
tazewell,
section
of
tennessee.
now
if
you
would
refer
to
this
map,
you
would
see
that
the
kentucky-tennessee
state
line
is
near
the
top
of
the
map.
it
comes
from
a
point
on
the
west
until
it
intersects
ku's

of
service
area
then
up
to
the
point
i'm

which
is
the
point
where
virginia,

converge.
then
the

passes

say

of

justice

well,
on
the
date
of
the
act,
do
you
say
that
other
than
that,
you
had
up
there
was
the
showing
the
corridor
--
with
your
so-called
corridor.
you
say
on
the
date
the
act
went
into
effect,
as
--
those
were
the
boundaries
of
tva
territory
and
between
tva

is
that
it?
justice

yes.
justice

yes.

yes.
well,
the

the

is
that

justice

is
that
your
--
well,
the
five-mile
--
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
i
understand,
that's
what
--
you
do
say
then
that
tva
territory
ended
at
those
gray
--
at
those
--
at
that
shaded
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
would
have
the
authority
over
the
act
to
go
ahead
and
serve
anywhere
in
that
shaded
area
except
as
you
say
in

tazewell.
justice
byron

except
in
the
tazewell?
justice
byron

white
well,
what
about
the
five-mile
of
the
periphery?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
that
isn't
one
of
my
question
--
justice
byron

white
i
believe
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
would
be
a
contrary
to
the
act
if
one
of
the
customers
you
are
now
serving
in
that
corridor
outside
of
tazewell
ask
the
tva
to
supply
them
power
and
the
tva
build
a
line
into
--
or
one
of
their
distributors
build
a
line
into
them
and
supply
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
do
you
agree
with
the
--
with
your
opponent
that
in
that
so-called
corridor,
what
if
--
would
you
tell
us
that
or
not
or
however
wide
or
narrow
it
is,
within
that
corridor
outside
tazewell,
the
tva
may
not
serve
customers
which
are
now
served
by
ku.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
that's
on
a
different
basis.
that's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
--
but
now
let's
assume
that
they
--
that
you
agreed
that
the
ku
--
that
you
do
have
a
boundary
line
inside
with
them,
that
that
corridor
does
exist
that
that
is
the
boundary
line
between
ku
and
tva.
what
about
the
operation
of
the
five-mile
rule
--
justice

--
outside
tazewell?
justice
byron

white
and
tazewell?
justice
byron

white
i
understand
that
but
do
you
think
if

do
you
think
it
is
just
an
open
invitation,
an
open
right
to
expand
beyond
your
