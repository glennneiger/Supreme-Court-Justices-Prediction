mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
picture
of
what
is
involved
in
this
copyright
dispute
is
so
contrary
to
a
four
weeks
trial
with
experts,
thousands
of
pages
of
depositions,
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
in
a
profound
74
page
printed
opinion
and
the
unanimous
affirmance
by
court
of
appeals
in
the
24
page
printed
opinion
that
i
think
i'd
better
stop
to
dissipate
the
notion
that
we're
dealing
with
rooftop
antennas
which
are
not
copyright
infringements
at
all
and
explained
briefly
at
the
out
set
what
this
system
is.
it
has
just
as
clarksburg
and
fairmont
system
has
steel
towers,
a
hundred
feet
high
connected
with
a
cat
volt
of
25
feet
with
five
antennas
arrays.
it
has
a
head-in
equipment
which
is
as
extensive
as
a
broadcasting
stations
equipment.
it
has
665
miles
of
cable
and
strands
on
10,000
poles
for
which
a
franchise
has
been
obtained
from
this
two
cities.
it
has
ten
men
to
maintain
the
system,
two
of
them
engineers.
it
has
2,000
to
3,000
tubes
in
both
systems
as
compared
with
the
150
tubes
in
a
transmitter
of
a
small
broadcasting
station.
it
cost
the
small
equipment
$750,000.00
to
a
million
dollars
without
the
head-in
equipment.
the
installation
charges
were
$200.00
a
month
or
a
$110.00
and
$6.00
monthly
charge,
meaning
a
collection
of
$630,000.00
a
year
for
this
small
equipment
from
15,000
subscribers.
so
that
when
your
honor,
i
ask
whether
you
could
direct
the
same
kind
of
antenna,
if
your
honor
wish
to
spend
$800,000.00
direct
to
these
towers
and
ten
engineers
and
then
to
run
it,
you
could.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
isn't
your
honor,
i'm
sure.
but
the
master
antenna
or
rooftop
antenna
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
was
no
finding
that
it
was
a
violation.
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
it
is
a
violation
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
right
now,
it's
function
is
not
to
send
out
to
thousands
of
subscribers
or
less
a
picture
through
a
treatment
and
change
of
channel
in
this
complex,
sophisticated
equipment.
it
doesn't
advertise
for
subscribers.
it
is
as
much
a
facility
in
the
house,
let's
say
a
refrigerator
or
anything
else
that
is
supplied
in
order
to
facilitate
the
rental
arrangement.
there's
actually
no
profit
made
in
those
situations
but
it's
usually
a
charge
to
keep
a
thousand
antennas
off
the
roof
so
that
each
band
doesn't
have
an
antenna
and
the
accidents
which
result
to
their
problem.
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
any
finding
that
there
was
a
master
antenna
case
involved
here
at
all.
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
it's
a
violation.
the
thoughts
here
as
well
as
that
of
damages
which
i
shall
address
myself
too
are
simply
to
avoid
the
simple
issue
that
a
catv
system
takes
copyright
material
and
pays
nothing
for
it
while
all
the
stations,
local
stations
it
competes
with
are
paying
for
that
property,
hundreds
of
thousand,
indeed
millions
of
dollars.
we
want
the
catv
systems.
it
provides
with
the
copyright
on
it.
it
provides
a
new
market
and
we
hope
they
prosper
as
indeed
they
are
but
not
without
paying
a
license
fee
and
keeping
the
unjust
enrichment
which
they
receive
from
these
moneys.
now,
there
are
six
points
that
i've
observed
that
counsel
made
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
which
by
choice
of
sort
of
anticipated
rebuttal,
i
will
address
myself
to
briefly
before
treating
more
completely
the
issues
involved.
catv
bespeaks
the
public
interest
in
receiving
free
telecast
yet
it
along
in
the
entire
broadcast
industry
imposes
a
direct
charge
on
the
public
for
television
reception
and
the
evidence
given
before
various
senate
committees
that
it
receives
a
72%
profit
on
its
collections
and
a
59%
profit
on
its
capital
investor.
these
extraordinary
figures
of
course
due
to
the
fact
that
they
don't
pay
for
the
merchandise
they
sell
which
is
the
royalties
they
ought
to
pay
for
the
copyrighted
material.
catv
claims
deep
concern
for
anti
competitive
consequences
of
the
copy
--
if
the
copyright
law
is
applied
to
it.
yet
catv
engages
in
the
most
deadly
unfair
competition
with
the
local
tv
stations
since
it
pays
nothing
for
programs
for
which
the
local
station
pay
63%
of
its
operating
cause.
indeed
in
this
very
case
your
honor,
the
evidence
is
that
the
local
tv
station
in
clarksburg,
wboy
was
bought
out
by
the
petitioner
catv
since
its
cost
could
not
compete
within
any
more
than
a
grocery
store
could
compete
with
any
other
store
when
it
paid
for
its
merchandise
and
its
competitor
did
not.
the
fcc
has
reported
in
its
second
order
that
it
cannot
consider
catv
operation
“a
fair
method
of
competition
with
local
stations”.
catv
protested
that
it
is
not
dealing
with
programs
but
it's
only
on
antenna
service.
but
when
wboy
is
a
very
local
tv
station
before
it
succumb,
subscribed
to
the
petitioner's
tv
system
--
catv
system
and
then
rebroadcast
a
program
that
had
received
on
this
subscription.
the
petitioner
laid
a
trap
by
cutting
off
its
own
broadcast
and
putting
on
the
air
and
announcement
“trouble
on
the
network”
it
incidentally
shows
that
they
can
originate
with
them
and
send
out
their
own
messages
which
159
of
them
do
originate
programs.
and
when
this
sign
appeared
on
wboy's
broadcast,
a
letter
followed
from
the
petitioner
which
is
an
evidence
demanding
that
wboy
be
ceased
from
“rebroadcasting
programs”
our
programs.
thus
the
petitioner
who
has
choose
the
word
program
in
describing
its
activities,
considered
someone
else's
retransmission
of
a
catv
broadcast
an
appropriation
of
its
program.
catv
pleads
that
its
activity
does
not
involve
a
corporeal
right
which
could
be
the
subject
of
a
copyright
license
that
it
did
only
propagates
electromagnetic
energy.
yet
when
a
railroad
worker
in
clarksburg
tapped
a
catv
cable
to
get
the
program
into
his
home,
the
petitioner,
catv
induced
the
district
attorney
to
have
a
warrant
of
arrest
issued
and
the
accused
was
confined
in
jail
for
12
to
18
hours
because
he
couldn't
raise
the
bail
and
thereafter
was
convicted
and
pay
the
fine.
the
petitioner
was
so
intent
on
protecting
its
program,
its
property
from
being
siphoned
off
that
it
resorted
to
the
criminal
laws
but
when
the
creators
of
literary
works
seek
to
protect
their
rights
under
the
copyright
statute,
catv
tells
them
they
have
none
because
it
is
transmitting
a
femoral
electromagnetic
energy.
mr.
louis
nizer
what?
mr.
louis
nizer
the
evidence
–-
mr.
louis
nizer
the
testimony
was
they
claimed
it
was
a
trespass
and
that
they
have
blown
out
the
service
but
actually
of
course
it
isn't
trespass
to
take
a
line
that
was
taking
their
property
which
was
really
involved.
this
was
a
matter
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
is
by
a
manager
who
didn't
know
the
law
that
he
thought
it
was
a
trespass
charge.
mr.
louis
nizer
alright,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
substantiate
it
your
honor.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
it
was
--
mr.
louis
nizer
it
was
a
testimony
given
in
a
deposition
by
a
manager
in
fairmont
who
characterize
that
he
believe
that's
a
trespass
charge.
there
is
no
record
of
the
actual
criminal
proceeding
except
for
that
testimony.
that
when
a
new
tenant
moves
in
to
an
apartment
which
already
has
had
a
catv
installation.
catv
requires
him
to
pay
another
installation
fee
although
nothing
has
to
be
done
but
it's
reduced
from
$125.00
to
$110.00
and
if
he
doesn't,
the
catv
executive
who
testified
referred
to
this
as
“stealing
my
signal”
and
this
phrase
connotes
the
very
property
right
which
catv
pretends
does
not
exist.
catv
asserts
a
conflict
between
the
communication
act
and
the
copyright
law.
there
is
none
your
honor.
the
federal
communication
commission
itself
has
rejected
this
contention
and
asserted
its
communication
policy
with
regards
to
catv.
it
has
said
in
its
second
report,
i
quote
“our
decision
is
not
intended
to
affect
in
anyway
the
pending
copyright
suits
referring
to
this
litigation
involving
as
they
do
matters
entirely
beyond
our
jurisdiction.
the
fact
that
we
have
given
the
local
station
the
right
to
have
its
signal
carry
over
catv
system
upholds
no
defense
to
that
system
in
the
copyright
suit.”
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor,
there
has
been
an
attempt
made
and
that
is
where
the
attempt
should
be
made
to
amend
the
copyright
act
so
as
to
create
certain
--
either
compulsory
licenses
or
involved
provision
with
respect
to
catv.
it's
quite
complicated.
thus
far
your
honor,
the
house
has
not
accepted
that
proposal
to
change
the
act,
it's
still
under
consideration
and
it
is
coming
before
the
senate.
there
is
a
good
deal
that
has
been
done
by
the
two
industries
mainly
the
copyright
owning
industry,
the
office,
writers,
copyright
owners,
companies
and
the
catv
industry
which
is
organized
into
an
association
of
some
500
members
to
impress
upon
the
legislature,
the
need
for
some
special
kind
of
amendment
to
the
copyright
act.
the
register
of
copyright
has
issued
a
statement
which
i
hope
to
quote
in
which
he
says
that
clearly,
this
is
a
performance.it
is
a
violation
of
the
copyright
act
and
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
to
the
effort
is
being
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
the
catv
industry
is
attempting
to
get
an
exemption
written
into
the
act
to
change
the
act
as
it
is
now
which
i
think
everyone
recognizes
encompasses
them
in
copyright
infringement.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
when
i
say,
everyone
recognizes,
what
i
mean
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
presumptuous.
i
mean
that
thus
far,
the
only
courts
which
have
passed
on
it
and
the
register
of
copyright
and
other
statements
made
by
the
authorities.
mr.
louis
nizer
by
the
catv
to
get
some
kind
of
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
explicitly
to
get
some
kind
of
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
we
don't
need
any
inclusion
of
catv.
we
believe
your
honor
respectfully
that
it
is
in
--
mr.
louis
nizer
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
mr.
louis
nizer
no
your
honor
because
as
an
individual
company,
we
may
refer
as
we
do
today
with
local
broadcasting
companies
to
give
one
rather
than
another
license
for
commercial
reasons.we
may
think
it's
a
better
station
and
to
that
extent,
each
individual
company
and
indeed
that's
true
of
every
copyright
owner
or
patent
owner
has
some
choice.
but
the
attempted
impression
which
is
being
given
here,
if
it
would
be
to
our
interest
generally
as
--
mr.
louis
nizer
of
court
mr.
justice
we
can
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
understand
sir.
the
best
information
we
have
is
about
50%
of
the
material
on
network
and
local
stations
is
copyrighted
and
the
other
50%
are
not.
and
of
this,
the
client
i
represent,
united
artist
and
i
presume
what
the
motion
pictures
represent
probably
about
5%
or
6%
of
all
motion
pictures
on
film,
on
tv
about
i
think
maybe
5%
to
6%.
those
are
the
best
statistics
available.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
have
personally,
after
this
decisions
came
down,
sent
a
letter
to
all
catv
stations
inviting
them
to
come
in
and
get
licenses
at
reasonable
fees.
they
are
customers
of
ours.
there's
no
reason
for
us
economically
to
which
to
buy
them.
we
welcome
a
need
of
this
kind
of
further
outlet
--
of
that
growth
at
crushing
uhf
possibilities
in
the
area.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
that
is
why
any
anticipation
of
any
repetition
of
past
sins
is
unlikely
a
view
--
as
mr.
justice
holmes
says,
“not
as
long
as
we're
here.”
and
i
think
that
to
take
away
a
copyright
right,
right.
i'm
not
suggesting
again
presumptuously
that
anyone
will
but
the
argument
that
a
copyright
right,
right,
which
exist
now
in
the
statute
should
be
taken
away
because
of
anticipation
that
there
maybe
abuse
of
that
right
which
we
should
have.
we
respectfully
submit
is
to
do
violation
to
every
statute
which
can
be
abused
or
illegally
applied
and
then
the
court's
are
there
for
that
remedy.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
your
honor
that
in
view
of
the
many,
many
copyright
companies
available
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
severest
competition
to
get
into
this
program.
indeed,
we
the
copyright
owners
are
for
the
catv
originating
programs
because
this
will
encourage
them
to
use
some
of
our
properties
to
do
it
directly.
we
are
appealing
to
whatever
authorities
they're
ought
to
give
them
back
right.
we
are
not
opposed
to
catv
on
every
economic
interest
and
instinct
is
to
encourage
them
to
grow
and
they
don't
need
our
encouragement.
it
has
been
suggested
your
honor,
i
testified
too
before
a
senate
hearing
that
by
1984,
there
will
be
a
hundred
and
ten
million
cabled
homes
and
that
the
income
to
catv
will
be
three
billion,
$200
million
a
year
more
than
all
the
income
from
all
the
tv
broadcasting
industry.
that's
how
quickly
they
are
growing
and
we
welcome
that
if
they
only
pay
and
they
can
afford
to
pay
the
reasonable
share
to
the
artist
who
had
created
the
material
which
they
are
using.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
a
correct
statement
to
this
proposal.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
his
position
that
the
--
but
you're
saying
that
--
you're
saying
that
everytime
in
a
house
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
a
catv
--
the
use
of
a
catv
service
to
exhibit
a
film
at
that
type
of
public
performance.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
because
whoever
else
intervenes
to
perform
even
within
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
your
honor,
if
isolated
to
an
individual
home,
what
you
say
is
true.
the
a
area
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
should
like
to
explain.
if
isolate
to
one
person
what
you
say
maybe
true
but
of
the
a
area
and
b
areas
are
constantly
shifting
and
there
are
many
people
who
would
not
see
this
program
at
all
except
for
this
new
transmission
which
brings
it
into
their
home
and
since
the
people
who
have
made
that
performance
and
it
is
accepting
performance
according
to
all
the
authorities,
the
buck
and
lasalle,
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
and
it
has
been
held
repeatedly.
there's
no
opinion
i
think
that
they
will
indicate
your
honor
anything
to
the
contrary.
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
the
buck
case
for
example
which
i
was
going
to
analyze
under
the
later
point
of
performance,
the
hotel
picked
up
a
radio
signal
but
had
a
very
special
kind
of
equipment
and
also
a
control
room
and
two
engineers,
it
wasn't
just
an
antenna
and
sent
it
down
to
1900
rooms
and
this
court
held
in
that
case,
justice
brandeis
writing
the
opinion
that
that
was
a
performance,
a
new
infringement
by
the
owner
even
though
those
people
might
or
might
not
have
received
it
on
their
own
radio.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
did
in
that
case
but
in
this
upward
case,
it
was
held
specifically
that
once
the
equipment
the
radio
wouldn't
make
the
slightest
difference
and
it
doesn't
because
that's
really
the
reception.
it
is
true
in
all
electromagnetic
phenomena
that
unless
you
turn
the
buckle
on
you
will
get
nothing
in
your
home.
but
the
ownership
of
a
television
set
which
is
available
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case
weeping
soundly.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
not
infringement.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
clearly
that
the
statute
does
not
make
reception
ever
in
infringement.
it
only
makes
performance.
the
language
is
--
mr.
louis
nizer
because
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
that's
right.
a
performance
in
the
sense
your
honor
in
terms
of
semantics
perhaps,
it
is
difficult
but
in
terms
of
legal
connotation
it
has
been
made
fairly
clear
a
turning
on
of
an
instrument,
radio
or
television
which
makes
the
performance
come
into
your
home
in
that
sense
performance
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act
which
does
not
forbid
reception
even
of
an
authorized
copyrighter
--
an
authorized
copyrighter.
in
other
words,
if
i
were
to
set
--
mr.
louis
nizer
the
--
it
would
make
it
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
charge
made
that
has
been
held
that
reception
for
profit
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
so
it
has
been
held.
so
if
your
honor
charged
or
of
a
store,
if
a
tenant
charge
to
see
the
television
program,
it
has
been
held
by
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
that's
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
only
reception
for
profit.
public
reception
for
a
profit
is
a
violation.
reception
otherwise
is
never
a
violation
under
the
act.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
the
authorities
have
held
that
reception
for
profit
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
nizer
pardon.
mr.
louis
nizer
there
was
no
occasion
to
it.
it
didn't
come
into
play
in
this
case.
justice
--
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
it
very
clearly
in
the
buck-lasalle
case
and
if
i
have
the
time,
i'd
like
to
refer
it
to
this
specific
analysis
of
that
point
which
he
made.
now,
implied
in
law
your
honor,
it
connotes
that
some
condition
is
imposed
at
least
on
one
of
the
parties
and
therefore
is
equivalent
to
a
compulsory
license
but
when
the
copyright
statute
intended
to
provide
a
compulsory
license,
it
did
so
high
further
for
example
section
1
(e)
music.
there
is
a
compulsory
license
for
records
to
a
sense
of
that
but
this
compulsory
license
was
conditioned
in
the
statute
upon
special
registration
formalities
and
periodical
accountings
under
oath.
but
when
congress
intended
also
a
complete
exemption
under
the
copyright
act
and
also,
you
have
to
provide
it
explicitly
in
this
copyright
statute
when
it
exempted
jukeboxes
from
any
copyright
liability
whatsoever.
incidentally
your
honors
that
is
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
that
this
exemption
was
urged
upon
the
congress,
it
was
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
minor
advertising
device
at
any
powers
they
have
now
become
a
$500
million
a
year
industry
without
paying
a
cent
of
the
composers
and
musicians
at
least
until
the
new
copyright
act
goes
into
effect.
i
think
that
is
going
to
be
changed
your
honors.
this
illustrates
the
danger
even
for
the
legislature
in
granting
exemptions
when
the
art
may
prosper
subsequently.
in
this
case,
the
catv
we're
dealing
already
with
the
giant
and
to
imply
a
license,
a
concept
to
which
binds
lower
guardian
law
in
this
field
at
all
on
the
unwanted
grounds
of
judicial
flexibility
to
cover
out
special
privileges
as
unwarranted.
in
buck
against
lasalle
too
your
honor,
it
was
urged
to
make
an
acception
to
the
copyright
act
to
the
benefit
of
hotel
keepers
who
used
radio
broadcast
for
its
own
commercial
purpose.
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
there,
the
existing
statute
makes
no
such
exception
and
if
one
is
to
be
made,
it
must
be
done
by
the
legislature
and
not
the
courts.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general,
contend
that
a
license
implied
in
law
under
the
copyright
act
results
from
what
they
turn
communications
policy.
communications
policy
can
only
have
two
sources
your
honor,
the
act
itself
and
the
actions
of
the
commission.
one
can
search
the
communications
act
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
find
nothing
directly
or
implied
dealing
with
copyrights.
there
is
a
communication
policy
with
respect
to
catv
clearly
announced
that
it
is
to
lessen
catv's
unfair
competitive
advantage
over
local
broadcaster
which
arise
--
mr.
louis
nizer
this
is
a
quotation
of
it
your
honor.
i
believe
i
have
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
no
this
is
the
regulations
to
repeatedly
and
rules
announced
can
the
first
and
second
order?
no,
the
communications--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
case.
the
catv
has
taken
the
position
your
honor
that
for
the
commission
has
taken
the
position.
the
catv
which
leads
the
phase
for
its
programs
your
honors
the
exclusive
rights
of
the
local
tv
station
to
programs
for
which
it
pays
is
unfair
competition
and
wishes
to
limit
that
in
order
to
increase
the
competitive
opportunity.
i
wish
to
insert
the
other
fact
that
the
legislative
purpose
was
also
to
encourage
uhf
development.
that's
ultra
high
frequency
is
against
very
high
frequency
that
has
70
possibilities
and
this
was
not
making
headway
your
honor
until
the
congress
passed
a
special
statute
requiring
all
television
sets
to
have
uhf
reception
and
you
now
see
it
on
every
television
set.
and
for
a
while
your
honor
uhf
began
to
grow
but
when
the
catv
group,
it
was
preposterous
to
expect
the
uhf
station
to
make
its
investment
and
also
go
into
the
field
in
competition
with
someone
who
got
the
product
free
for
which
uhf
would
have
had
to
pay
a
license.
and
the
commission
stated
clearly
that
the
reason
why
it
was
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
adopt
the
carriage
requirement
which
i
think
was
explained
to
you
your
honors
this
morning,
the
non-duplication
rule
and
the
distant
signal
rule
and
the
reason
for
this
and
here,
i
have
the
quotation
mr.
justice
fortas
was
to
ameliorate
the
risk
the
bargaining
catv
industry
would
have
a
future
adverse
impact
on
television
broadcast
service
both
existing
and
potential.
that's
in
the
second
order
in
725.
in
short
your
honor,
the
commission
emphasized
not
once
but
many
times
that
the
condition
it
was
trying
to
overcome
resulted
from
the
inability
of
the
present
copyrighter
to
enforce
their
rights
with
respect
to
catv.
for
example,
the
commission
said
on
another
occasion
in
the
light
of
the
unequal
footing
on
which
the
broadcasters
and
catv
systems
now
stand.
we
cannot
regard
any
catv
systems
duplication
of
local
programming
via
the
signals
of
distant
stations
is
a
fair
method
of
computation.
that's
also
in
that
order.
i
have
one
more
quotation
on
the
question
you're
asked
your
honor.
the
commission
said
that
“we
cannot
close
our
eyes
to
the
significance
which
the
present
inability
of
program
supplies
to
control
the
availability
of
their
programs
via
catv
has
from
petition
between
catv
and
broadcasting
station.”
now
this
being
the
one
and
only
communication
policy
based
on
the
inability
of
copyright
owners
to
enforce
the
existing
law
against
catv
and
the
consequent
burdens
placed
on
the
commission
by
the
intransigence
of
catv,
how
anomalous
it
is
to
argue
that
it
is
necessary
to
exempt
catv
from
copyright
liability
in
order
to
coalesce
the
communications
policy
with
the
copyright
law.
in
the
petitioners
replied
brief,
he
contends
that
it
is
not
as
reasserted
as
to
policy
and
he
quotes
the
fcc
the
second
order
paragraph
47
to
the
effect
that
quote
--
that
commission
goal
was
to
integrate
catv
service
into
the
national
television
structure
in
such
a
way
as
to
promote
maximum
television
service
to
both
those
who
are
cable
viewers
and
those
dependent
and
off
their
service.
the
petitioner
has
however
omitted
the
very
next
sentence
of
the
passage
which
reads
“the
new
rules
discussed
below,
that's
the
carriage
and
duplication
distant
signal
rules
are
the
minimum
measures
we
believe
to
be
essential
to
ensure
that
catv
continues
to
perform
its
valuable
supplemental
role
without
unduly
damaging
or
impeding
the
growth
of
television
broadcasting
service.”
so
i
repeat
your
honor,
there
is
only
one
catv
communication
policy
with
respect
to
catv
and
it
lends
no
support
to
any
theory
for
an
implied
license.
now
who
would
benefit
from
the
exemption
sought
and
at
whose
expense.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
the
implied
in
law
theory
contrary
to
the
precise
language
giving
us
exclusive
rights
for
every
public
performance
without
limitation
is
a
misnomer
and
as
a
semantic,
wittingly
or
unwittingly
a
semantic
device
to
put
a
good
color
on
an
impossible
concept
in
this
case.
so
we
have
translated
it
to
be
what
it
must
be
even
a
compulsory
license
or
an
exemption.
it
can't
be
anything
else
because
there
is
no
warrant
to
say
under
this
act
that
one
can
apply
on
how
he
make
it
and
with
what
the
guarantees
to
the
owner
to
the
contrary.
now
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
and
i
am
able
to
persuade
you
but
the
briefs
and
the
clarities
will
make
it
rather
clear.
it
isn't
involved
and
refined
subject
matter
not
and
rather
sophisticated
analysis
but
having
made
it
leave
with
this
for
years.
i
may
say
to
you
your
honor,
something
should
be
explained.
this
case
is
six
years
old,
the
defendants
put
in
every
conceivable
defense
which
is
now
put
aside
for
separate
trial.
i
think
your
honors
ought
to
understand
that
legends.
stop
them
because
we
gave
a
license
we
must
have
included
this.
copyrights
are
not
properly
noticed.
it's
claimed
to
be
eligible.
antitrust
law
violation
and
after
six
years
of
delay
during
which
they
were
making
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
we
think
of
unjust
profits.
the
court
finally
--
the
chief
justice
and
the
district
court
said
we
will
put
a
note
to
this
delay
and
we
will
try
this
case
in
separate
sections.
we
will
try
first
the
copyright
infringement,
is
there
one?
and
then
after
we
will
put
aside
implied
license
in
fact
in
other
words
by
giving
a
license
to
the
copyright
--
to
the
station,
have
we
thereby
granted
a
license
to
catv.
they
have
that
issue.
it
will
be
tried
subsequently
your
honor.
and
damages
had
been
put
aside
and
the
law
is
clear
that
there
can
be
no
oppressive
damages
such
as
it's
been
feared
here
and
the
stopple
and
ledges
and
all
the
other
defenses
have
been
put
aside
and
after
six
years,
we
finally
got
to
an
issue
where
we
could
come
to
grips
with
this
question
while
our
copyrights
were
dying
due
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
were
running
out
and
due
to
the
statute
of
limitations
of
three
years
once
you
know
you
have
a
claim
and
everyday
that
goes
fine.
we
lose
those
rights
for
these
arguments
and
it
was
to
stop
that
that
the
courts
split
this
case
into
four
parts
and
many
of
the
matters
which
our
adversary
refers
to,
he
will
have
a
full
day
in
court
after
this
case
is
decided
by
your
honors.
now,
who
would
profit
from
this
exemption?
the
catv
who
never
creates
anything
except
those
159
stations
that
are
beginning
to
originate
programs,
i
think
they
do.
sells
a
product
which
others
have
invested
millions
of
dollars
which
they
appropriate
without
even
a
thank
you,
this
profit
exorbitantly
not
by
virtue
of
skill
but
because
they're
not
paying
on
what
the
merchandise
they
sell
who
frustrate
the
communication
policy
of
encouraging
local
stations
particularly
uhf
which
serve
local
expression.
mr.
louis
nizer
pay
them.
yes
your
honor.
yes.
in
all
and
that
is
why
we
hope
your
honor
they
prosper
and
even
to
begin
to
originate
more
programs
that
will
give
as
an
outlet
of
the
copyright
owners
and
all
the
others
or
the
field
which
we
--
which
the
others
particularly
desperately
need
as
the
briefs
here
indicate.
mr.
louis
nizer
none
at
all.
anymore
your
honor
than
a
local
station
that
receives
by
microwave
a
program
--
this
is
the
way
all
network
works.
there
are
very
few
live
programs
from
the
major
network.
they
put
it
on
tape,
they
send
it
to
your
local
station
here
but
it
just
receives
this
electromagnetic
energy
which
we
talked
about
and
sends
it
out,
rebroadcast
the
same
person.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
is
arranging
the
program
and
it
pays
license
fees
for
everything
that
it
engages
and
then
sends
it
out
by
this
--
the
same
way
and
the
only
difference
is
they
send
it
over
the
air
and
they
send
it
by
wire.
otherwise,
it's
precisely
the
same.
there
are
differences
that
a
broad
--
and
this
was
analyzed
by
the
court,
a
broadcasting
station
goes
to
advertise
at
the
present
time
they
don't
but
there's
nothing
to
stop
them
from
going
to
advertise
and
they
will
as
soon
as
they
originate
programs.
mr.
louis
nizer
they
do
only
in
this
sense
your
honor.
they
denied
that
they
do
attempting
to
make
another
distinction
but
actually,
they
select
from
the
various
different
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
but
you
go
very
far.
for
example,
they
picked
up
pittsburg
and
they
advertised
mr.
justice
warren
asked
about
football,
it
was
a
felicitous
question
in
view
of
the
evidence
here.
they
advertise
--
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
football
and
baseball
games
is
by
coming
to
our
cable
because
no
one
else
will
have
it
due
to
local
conditions
and
restrictions.
mr.
louis
nizer
oh
yes.
they
have
--
they
now
build
them.
it
started
with
three,
five,
they've
gone
to
twelve
and
now
twenty
stations
and
they
select
which
ones
they
want
and
if
the
local
tv
is
not
on
it,
that
station
is
going
to
die
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
that
selection
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
if
they
have
20
channels.
i
suppose
you
could
--
mr.
louis
nizer
if
they
chose
to
you
have,
yes,
on
the
uhf
band
particularly
and
i
suppose
on
the
vhf
13
would
be
the
limit.
you
can't
get
more
than
13.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
they
quite
so.
i
think
they
are
and
your
honor,
the
testimony
was
that
they
even
had
a
poll
taken
of
their
subscribers.
what
do
you
wish?
but
when
the
subscribers
wish
something
which
they
found
was
a
little
more
expensive
to
bring
in,
they
ignored
it
just
the
same
but
there
was
this
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
--
mr.
louis
nizer
oh
yes.
they
do
it
all
the
time
and
they
do
not
only
that
your
honor.
those
--
it
is
far
more
serious
than
that
as
one
of
the
questions
elicited
a
proper
answer
from
counsel.
they
will
convert
the
signal
from
one
to
another.
they
will
change
the
band.
channel
9
will
be
on
their
station
channel
2
if
they
wish.
they
have
the
equipment
with
which
to
do
this
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
more
power
and
get
further
stations
away
for
sending
so
that
the
identity
of
the
station
is
lost
as
well
in
cost
of--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor.
they
can
pick
whatever
they
wish
off
the
air.
take
it
and
then
send
it
out.
indeed
their
advertising
was
unless
you
subscribe
to
the
clarksburg
station,
you
will
never
get
the
three
big
networks.
we're
the
only
one
who
can
give
it
to
you
and
that
was
true.
now
what
chances
a
copyright
owner
to
sell
his
product
in
clarksburg
to
the
local
tv
station
when
the
local
tv
station
says,
“i'm
hardly
listened
to,
they've
got
the
football
and
other
big
programs
that
i'll
see
in
here
and
i
can't
have
that?”
they
took
full
advantage
of
that
in
their
advertising
and
there
were
letters
of
evidence.
one
of
which
was
by
the
manager
of
a
catv
system
saying,
“we
have
this
baseball
we're
going
to
bring
you
in
here.
it
was
close
to
world
series
time
or
might
have
been
world
series.”
and
our
opponent,
wboy,
the
independent
local
station
is
claiming
that
it's
going
to
get
a
baseball
game
in
here
but
i
don't
see
how
i've
talked
to
these
people,
they're
not
getting
that
license
it's
too
expensive
on
whatever
the
reason
was
and
they
advertise
the
only
way
you're
going
to
get
this
is
by
coming
to
the
catv
system.
i
also
wish
to
point
out
and
i
omitted
to
say
something
which
maybe
helpful
in
my
effort
to
persuade
that
even
if
a
copyright
infringer
does
not
cause
damage.
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
the
profits.
under
the
copyright
law,
it
is
clear
that
if
you
can
recover
either
damager
all
profits,
in
other
words,
the
unjust
enrichments
still
belongs
to
you
even
if
you
haven't
been
heard
and
therefore
even
in
the
local
areas
or
anywhere
else
where
a
intervening
broadcaster
send
even
to
the
same
people,
we,
the
copyright
owners
are
damaged
in
two
ways.
that
is
damaged
by
loss
of
profits
at
least
in
two
ways.
one,
we
have
not
received
part
of
that
royalty
that
we
should
have
gotten
and
secondly
the
local
station
has
been
heard
and
we
have
far
more
difficulty
selling
them
and
indeed
we
can't
at
all.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
there
isn't
--
that's
quite
right.
there
isn't
the
sensitive
relationship
between
audience
which
our
friend
here
argues
and
the
fee.
far
more
significant
in
the
bargaining
process
as
the
evidence
would
show,
this
is
for
later
damages.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
i
must
be
fair
to
say
as
yet.
but
far
more
important
than
merely
audience
at
least
15,000
subscribers
added
to
a
million
viewers,
far
more
important
is
how
many
stations
are
there
in
the
area.
that's
what
creates
the
competition
and
then
it
gives
us
a
chance
to
get
more
money
where
as
one
station,
we
have
very
much
bargaining
power
and
also,
how
much
inventory
have
they
if
the
station
has
bought
motion
pictures
from
warner
brothers
and
united
artist
comes.
it
is
not
a
very
good
position.
so
that
the
economic
factors
here
are
not
--
are
completely
over
simplified
where
it
is
said
just
more
audience,
more
money.
it
doesn't
reflect
itself
that
way
at
all
but
whatever
there
is
to
that,
you'll
have
this
day
in
court
on
that
on
the
question
of
damages
and
applied
license
in
fact
and
double
payment,
all
of
these
issues
that
have
been
raised
here,
he
will
have
his
trial
after
your
honors
decide
this
if
there
is
anything
to
go
to
trial.
now,
i
was
saying
who
is
victimized
by
this
implied
license
of
law
or
exemption
or
whatever
it
is
called.
in
addition
to
all
the
copyright
companies,
owners
that
have
spent
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
for
these
licenses
and
find
that
they're
just
being
taken,
there
are
16,000
actors
in
the
screen
actors
guild
who
is
averaging
from
the
year
it
was
testified
before
the
senate
is
$3000.00
a
year
according
to
charlton
heston
testified.
there
are
3000
writers
of
the
writers
guild
who
depend
upon
their
livelihood
from
television.
the
testimony
is
that
their
largest
income
comes
from
this
broadcast
today,
all
of
these
others.
3300
members
of
the
directors
guild,
16,000
members
of
actor
--
it's
the
union
that
takes
care
of
the
small
mid
players
and
so
on.1
50
composers
of
the
screen
composes,
more
than
10,000
members
of
ascap,
14,000
writers
and
publishers
of
bmi
and
tens
of
thousands
of
musicians
and
thousands
of
other
artists.
they
are
the
ones
who
are
being
deprived.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
would
go
to
the
implied
license
in
fact
that
we've
been
paid.
mr.
louis
nizer
well
--
double
payment
thus
it
is
argued
that
will
be
for
a
trial
and
since
my
time
is
limited,
i
would
like
to
--
if
your
honor
will
excuse
me,
just
very
briefly
reply.
it
is
a
very
involved
subject.
i
think
--
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
appreciate
it
your
honor.
i
haven't
even
touch
the
performance
which
i
did
want
to
address
myself
so
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
briefs.
but
on
this
subject
your
honor,
the
evidence
that
is
now
in
the
record
since
depositions
were
permitted
on
this
subject
even
though
it
was
kept
for
a
separate
trial.
the
evidence
already
in
the
record
in
the
depositions
is
that
we
are
injured
far
more
by
losing
the
local
tv
stations
opportunity
to
purchase
and
we
all
by
any
theoretical
notion
that
because
there
are
more
listeners
or
viewers
that
we
can
get
a
larger
fee.
it
doesn't
work
out
that
way.
it
is
completely
and
the
evidence
also
shows
that
one
of
our
companies
that
invested
money
in
the
--
a
full
group
of
pictures,
copyrights
brought
them
for
this
purpose
has
lost
$10
million
because
it
hasn't
got
the
outlet
that
it
expected
to
have
due
to
catv.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
picture
of
what
is
involved
in
this
copyright
dispute
is
so
contrary
to
a
four
weeks
trial
with
experts,
thousands
of
pages
of
depositions,
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
in
a
profound
74
page
printed
opinion
and
the
unanimous
affirmance
by
court
of
appeals
in
the
24
page
printed
opinion
that
i
think
i'd
better
stop
to
dissipate
the
notion
that
we're
dealing
with
rooftop
antennas
which
are
not
copyright
infringements
at
all
and
explained
briefly
at
the
out
set
what
this
system
is.
it
has
just
as
clarksburg
and
fairmont
system
has
steel
towers,
a
hundred
feet
high
connected
with
a
cat
volt
of
25
feet
with
five
antennas
arrays.
it
has
a
head-in
equipment
which
is
as
extensive
as
a
broadcasting
stations
equipment.
it
has
665
miles
of
cable
and
strands
on
10,000
poles
for
which
a
franchise
has
been
obtained
from
this
two
cities.
it
has
ten
men
to
maintain
the
system,
two
of
them
engineers.
it
has
2,000
to
3,000
tubes
in
both
systems
as
compared
with
the
150
tubes
in
a
transmitter
of
a
small
broadcasting
station.
it
cost
the
small
equipment
$750,000.00
to
a
million
dollars
without
the
head-in
equipment.
the
installation
charges
were
$200.00
a
month
or
a
$110.00
and
$6.00
monthly
charge,
meaning
a
collection
of
$630,000.00
a
year
for
this
small
equipment
from
15,000
subscribers.
so
that
when
your
honor,
i
ask
whether
you
could
direct
the
same
kind
of
antenna,
if
your
honor
wish
to
spend
$800,000.00
direct
to
these
towers
and
ten
engineers
and
then
to
run
it,
you
could.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
isn't
your
honor,
i'm
sure.
but
the
master
antenna
or
rooftop
antenna
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
was
no
finding
that
it
was
a
violation.
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
it
is
a
violation
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
right
now,
it's
function
is
not
to
send
out
to
thousands
of
subscribers
or
less
a
picture
through
a
treatment
and
change
of
channel
in
this
complex,
sophisticated
equipment.
it
doesn't
advertise
for
subscribers.
it
is
as
much
a
facility
in
the
house,
let's
say
a
refrigerator
or
anything
else
that
is
supplied
in
order
to
facilitate
the
rental
arrangement.
there's
actually
no
profit
made
in
those
situations
but
it's
usually
a
charge
to
keep
a
thousand
antennas
off
the
roof
so
that
each
band
doesn't
have
an
antenna
and
the
accidents
which
result
to
their
problem.
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
any
finding
that
there
was
a
master
antenna
case
involved
here
at
all.
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
it's
a
violation.
the
thoughts
here
as
well
as
that
of
damages
which
i
shall
address
myself
too
are
simply
to
avoid
the
simple
issue
that
a
catv
system
takes
copyright
material
and
pays
nothing
for
it
while
all
the
stations,
local
stations
it
competes
with
are
paying
for
that
property,
hundreds
of
thousand,
indeed
millions
of
dollars.
we
want
the
catv
systems.
it
provides
with
the
copyright
on
it.
it
provides
a
new
market
and
we
hope
they
prosper
as
indeed
they
are
but
not
without
paying
a
license
fee
and
keeping
the
unjust
enrichment
which
they
receive
from
these
moneys.
now,
there
are
six
points
that
i've
observed
that
counsel
made
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
which
by
choice
of
sort
of
anticipated
rebuttal,
i
will
address
myself
to
briefly
before
treating
more
completely
the
issues
involved.
catv
bespeaks
the
public
interest
in
receiving
free
telecast
yet
it
along
in
the
entire
broadcast
industry
imposes
a
direct
charge
on
the
public
for
television
reception
and
the
evidence
given
before
various
senate
committees
that
it
receives
a
72%
profit
on
its
collections
and
a
59%
profit
on
its
capital
investor.
these
extraordinary
figures
of
course
due
to
the
fact
that
they
don't
pay
for
the
merchandise
they
sell
which
is
the
royalties
they
ought
to
pay
for
the
copyrighted
material.
catv
claims
deep
concern
for
anti
competitive
consequences
of
the
copy
--
if
the
copyright
law
is
applied
to
it.
yet
catv
engages
in
the
most
deadly
unfair
competition
with
the
local
tv
stations
since
it
pays
nothing
for
programs
for
which
the
local
station
pay
63%
of
its
operating
cause.
indeed
in
this
very
case
your
honor,
the
evidence
is
that
the
local
tv
station
in
clarksburg,
wboy
was
bought
out
by
the
petitioner
catv
since
its
cost
could
not
compete
within
any
more
than
a
grocery
store
could
compete
with
any
other
store
when
it
paid
for
its
merchandise
and
its
competitor
did
not.
the
fcc
has
reported
in
its
second
order
that
it
cannot
consider
catv
operation
“a
fair
method
of
competition
with
local
stations”.
catv
protested
that
it
is
not
dealing
with
programs
but
it's
only
on
antenna
service.
but
when
wboy
is
a
very
local
tv
station
before
it
succumb,
subscribed
to
the
petitioner's
tv
system
--
catv
system
and
then
rebroadcast
a
program
that
had
received
on
this
subscription.
the
petitioner
laid
a
trap
by
cutting
off
its
own
broadcast
and
putting
on
the
air
and
announcement
“trouble
on
the
network”
it
incidentally
shows
that
they
can
originate
with
them
and
send
out
their
own
messages
which
159
of
them
do
originate
programs.
and
when
this
sign
appeared
on
wboy's
broadcast,
a
letter
followed
from
the
petitioner
which
is
an
evidence
demanding
that
wboy
be
ceased
from
“rebroadcasting
programs”
our
programs.
thus
the
petitioner
who
has
choose
the
word
program
in
describing
its
activities,
considered
someone
else's
retransmission
of
a
catv
broadcast
an
appropriation
of
its
program.
catv
pleads
that
its
activity
does
not
involve
a
corporeal
right
which
could
be
the
subject
of
a
copyright
license
that
it
did
only
propagates
electromagnetic
energy.
yet
when
a
railroad
worker
in
clarksburg
tapped
a
catv
cable
to
get
the
program
into
his
home,
the
petitioner,
catv
induced
the
district
attorney
to
have
a
warrant
of
arrest
issued
and
the
accused
was
confined
in
jail
for
12
to
18
hours
because
he
couldn't
raise
the
bail
and
thereafter
was
convicted
and
pay
the
fine.
the
petitioner
was
so
intent
on
protecting
its
program,
its
property
from
being
siphoned
off
that
it
resorted
to
the
criminal
laws
but
when
the
creators
of
literary
works
seek
to
protect
their
rights
under
the
copyright
statute,
catv
tells
them
they
have
none
because
it
is
transmitting
a
femoral
electromagnetic
energy.
mr.
louis
nizer
what?
mr.
louis
nizer
the
evidence
–-
mr.
louis
nizer
the
testimony
was
they
claimed
it
was
a
trespass
and
that
they
have
blown
out
the
service
but
actually
of
course
it
isn't
trespass
to
take
a
line
that
was
taking
their
property
which
was
really
involved.
this
was
a
matter
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
is
by
a
manager
who
didn't
know
the
law
that
he
thought
it
was
a
trespass
charge.
mr.
louis
nizer
alright,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
substantiate
it
your
honor.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
it
was
--
mr.
louis
nizer
it
was
a
testimony
given
in
a
deposition
by
a
manager
in
fairmont
who
characterize
that
he
believe
that's
a
trespass
charge.
there
is
no
record
of
the
actual
criminal
proceeding
except
for
that
testimony.
that
when
a
new
tenant
moves
in
to
an
apartment
which
already
has
had
a
catv
installation.
catv
requires
him
to
pay
another
installation
fee
although
nothing
has
to
be
done
but
it's
reduced
from
$125.00
to
$110.00
and
if
he
doesn't,
the
catv
executive
who
testified
referred
to
this
as
“stealing
my
signal”
and
this
phrase
connotes
the
very
property
right
which
catv
pretends
does
not
exist.
catv
asserts
a
conflict
between
the
communication
act
and
the
copyright
law.
there
is
none
your
honor.
the
federal
communication
commission
itself
has
rejected
this
contention
and
asserted
its
communication
policy
with
regards
to
catv.
it
has
said
in
its
second
report,
i
quote
“our
decision
is
not
intended
to
affect
in
anyway
the
pending
copyright
suits
referring
to
this
litigation
involving
as
they
do
matters
entirely
beyond
our
jurisdiction.
the
fact
that
we
have
given
the
local
station
the
right
to
have
its
signal
carry
over
catv
system
upholds
no
defense
to
that
system
in
the
copyright
suit.”
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor,
there
has
been
an
attempt
made
and
that
is
where
the
attempt
should
be
made
to
amend
the
copyright
act
so
as
to
create
certain
--
either
compulsory
licenses
or
involved
provision
with
respect
to
catv.
it's
quite
complicated.
thus
far
your
honor,
the
house
has
not
accepted
that
proposal
to
change
the
act,
it's
still
under
consideration
and
it
is
coming
before
the
senate.
there
is
a
good
deal
that
has
been
done
by
the
two
industries
mainly
the
copyright
owning
industry,
the
office,
writers,
copyright
owners,
companies
and
the
catv
industry
which
is
organized
into
an
association
of
some
500
members
to
impress
upon
the
legislature,
the
need
for
some
special
kind
of
amendment
to
the
copyright
act.
the
register
of
copyright
has
issued
a
statement
which
i
hope
to
quote
in
which
he
says
that
clearly,
this
is
a
performance.it
is
a
violation
of
the
copyright
act
and
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
to
the
effort
is
being
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
the
catv
industry
is
attempting
to
get
an
exemption
written
into
the
act
to
change
the
act
as
it
is
now
which
i
think
everyone
recognizes
encompasses
them
in
copyright
infringement.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
when
i
say,
everyone
recognizes,
what
i
mean
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
presumptuous.
i
mean
that
thus
far,
the
only
courts
which
have
passed
on
it
and
the
register
of
copyright
and
other
statements
made
by
the
authorities.
mr.
louis
nizer
by
the
catv
to
get
some
kind
of
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
explicitly
to
get
some
kind
of
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
we
don't
need
any
inclusion
of
catv.
we
believe
your
honor
respectfully
that
it
is
in
--
mr.
louis
nizer
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
mr.
louis
nizer
no
your
honor
because
as
an
individual
company,
we
may
refer
as
we
do
today
with
local
broadcasting
companies
to
give
one
rather
than
another
license
for
commercial
reasons.we
may
think
it's
a
better
station
and
to
that
extent,
each
individual
company
and
indeed
that's
true
of
every
copyright
owner
or
patent
owner
has
some
choice.
but
the
attempted
impression
which
is
being
given
here,
if
it
would
be
to
our
interest
generally
as
--
mr.
louis
nizer
of
court
mr.
justice
we
can
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
understand
sir.
the
best
information
we
have
is
about
50%
of
the
material
on
network
and
local
stations
is
copyrighted
and
the
other
50%
are
not.
and
of
this,
the
client
i
represent,
united
artist
and
i
presume
what
the
motion
pictures
represent
probably
about
5%
or
6%
of
all
motion
pictures
on
film,
on
tv
about
i
think
maybe
5%
to
6%.
those
are
the
best
statistics
available.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
have
personally,
after
this
decisions
came
down,
sent
a
letter
to
all
catv
stations
inviting
them
to
come
in
and
get
licenses
at
reasonable
fees.
they
are
customers
of
ours.
there's
no
reason
for
us
economically
to
which
to
buy
them.
we
welcome
a
need
of
this
kind
of
further
outlet
--
of
that
growth
at
crushing
uhf
possibilities
in
the
area.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
that
is
why
any
anticipation
of
any
repetition
of
past
sins
is
unlikely
a
view
--
as
mr.
justice
holmes
says,
“not
as
long
as
we're
here.”
and
i
think
that
to
take
away
a
copyright
right,
right.
i'm
not
suggesting
again
presumptuously
that
anyone
will
but
the
argument
that
a
copyright
right,
right,
which
exist
now
in
the
statute
should
be
taken
away
because
of
anticipation
that
there
maybe
abuse
of
that
right
which
we
should
have.
we
respectfully
submit
is
to
do
violation
to
every
statute
which
can
be
abused
or
illegally
applied
and
then
the
court's
are
there
for
that
remedy.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
your
honor
that
in
view
of
the
many,
many
copyright
companies
available
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
severest
competition
to
get
into
this
program.
indeed,
we
the
copyright
owners
are
for
the
catv
originating
programs
because
this
will
encourage
them
to
use
some
of
our
properties
to
do
it
directly.
we
are
appealing
to
whatever
authorities
they're
ought
to
give
them
back
right.
we
are
not
opposed
to
catv
on
every
economic
interest
and
instinct
is
to
encourage
them
to
grow
and
they
don't
need
our
encouragement.
it
has
been
suggested
your
honor,
i
testified
too
before
a
senate
hearing
that
by
1984,
there
will
be
a
hundred
and
ten
million
cabled
homes
and
that
the
income
to
catv
will
be
three
billion,
$200
million
a
year
more
than
all
the
income
from
all
the
tv
broadcasting
industry.
that's
how
quickly
they
are
growing
and
we
welcome
that
if
they
only
pay
and
they
can
afford
to
pay
the
reasonable
share
to
the
artist
who
had
created
the
material
which
they
are
using.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
a
correct
statement
to
this
proposal.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
his
position
that
the
--
but
you're
saying
that
--
you're
saying
that
everytime
in
a
house
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
a
catv
--
the
use
of
a
catv
service
to
exhibit
a
film
at
that
type
of
public
performance.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
because
whoever
else
intervenes
to
perform
even
within
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
your
honor,
if
isolated
to
an
individual
home,
what
you
say
is
true.
the
a
area
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
should
like
to
explain.
if
isolate
to
one
person
what
you
say
maybe
true
but
of
the
a
area
and
b
areas
are
constantly
shifting
and
there
are
many
people
who
would
not
see
this
program
at
all
except
for
this
new
transmission
which
brings
it
into
their
home
and
since
the
people
who
have
made
that
performance
and
it
is
accepting
performance
according
to
all
the
authorities,
the
buck
and
lasalle,
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
and
it
has
been
held
repeatedly.
there's
no
opinion
i
think
that
they
will
indicate
your
honor
anything
to
the
contrary.
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
the
buck
case
for
example
which
i
was
going
to
analyze
under
the
later
point
of
performance,
the
hotel
picked
up
a
radio
signal
but
had
a
very
special
kind
of
equipment
and
also
a
control
room
and
two
engineers,
it
wasn't
just
an
antenna
and
sent
it
down
to
1900
rooms
and
this
court
held
in
that
case,
justice
brandeis
writing
the
opinion
that
that
was
a
performance,
a
new
infringement
by
the
owner
even
though
those
people
might
or
might
not
have
received
it
on
their
own
radio.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
did
in
that
case
but
in
this
upward
case,
it
was
held
specifically
that
once
the
equipment
the
radio
wouldn't
make
the
slightest
difference
and
it
doesn't
because
that's
really
the
reception.
it
is
true
in
all
electromagnetic
phenomena
that
unless
you
turn
the
buckle
on
you
will
get
nothing
in
your
home.
but
the
ownership
of
a
television
set
which
is
available
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case
weeping
soundly.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
not
infringement.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
clearly
that
the
statute
does
not
make
reception
ever
in
infringement.
it
only
makes
performance.
the
language
is
--
mr.
louis
nizer
because
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
that's
right.
a
performance
in
the
sense
your
honor
in
terms
of
semantics
perhaps,
it
is
difficult
but
in
terms
of
legal
connotation
it
has
been
made
fairly
clear
a
turning
on
of
an
instrument,
radio
or
television
which
makes
the
performance
come
into
your
home
in
that
sense
performance
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act
which
does
not
forbid
reception
even
of
an
authorized
copyrighter
--
an
authorized
copyrighter.
in
other
words,
if
i
were
to
set
--
mr.
louis
nizer
the
--
it
would
make
it
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
charge
made
that
has
been
held
that
reception
for
profit
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
so
it
has
been
held.
so
if
your
honor
charged
or
of
a
store,
if
a
tenant
charge
to
see
the
television
program,
it
has
been
held
by
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
that's
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
only
reception
for
profit.
public
reception
for
a
profit
is
a
violation.
reception
otherwise
is
never
a
violation
under
the
act.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
the
authorities
have
held
that
reception
for
profit
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
nizer
pardon.
mr.
louis
nizer
there
was
no
occasion
to
it.
it
didn't
come
into
play
in
this
case.
justice
--
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
it
very
clearly
in
the
buck-lasalle
case
and
if
i
have
the
time,
i'd
like
to
refer
it
to
this
specific
analysis
of
that
point
which
he
made.
now,
implied
in
law
your
honor,
it
connotes
that
some
condition
is
imposed
at
least
on
one
of
the
parties
and
therefore
is
equivalent
to
a
compulsory
license
but
when
the
copyright
statute
intended
to
provide
a
compulsory
license,
it
did
so
high
further
for
example
section
1
(e)
music.
there
is
a
compulsory
license
for
records
to
a
sense
of
that
but
this
compulsory
license
was
conditioned
in
the
statute
upon
special
registration
formalities
and
periodical
accountings
under
oath.
but
when
congress
intended
also
a
complete
exemption
under
the
copyright
act
and
also,
you
have
to
provide
it
explicitly
in
this
copyright
statute
when
it
exempted
jukeboxes
from
any
copyright
liability
whatsoever.
incidentally
your
honors
that
is
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
that
this
exemption
was
urged
upon
the
congress,
it
was
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
minor
advertising
device
at
any
powers
they
have
now
become
a
$500
million
a
year
industry
without
paying
a
cent
of
the
composers
and
musicians
at
least
until
the
new
copyright
act
goes
into
effect.
i
think
that
is
going
to
be
changed
your
honors.
this
illustrates
the
danger
even
for
the
legislature
in
granting
exemptions
when
the
art
may
prosper
subsequently.
in
this
case,
the
catv
we're
dealing
already
with
the
giant
and
to
imply
a
license,
a
concept
to
which
binds
lower
guardian
law
in
this
field
at
all
on
the
unwanted
grounds
of
judicial
flexibility
to
cover
out
special
privileges
as
unwarranted.
in
buck
against
lasalle
too
your
honor,
it
was
urged
to
make
an
acception
to
the
copyright
act
to
the
benefit
of
hotel
keepers
who
used
radio
broadcast
for
its
own
commercial
purpose.
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
there,
the
existing
statute
makes
no
such
exception
and
if
one
is
to
be
made,
it
must
be
done
by
the
legislature
and
not
the
courts.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general,
contend
that
a
license
implied
in
law
under
the
copyright
act
results
from
what
they
turn
communications
policy.
communications
policy
can
only
have
two
sources
your
honor,
the
act
itself
and
the
actions
of
the
commission.
one
can
search
the
communications
act
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
find
nothing
directly
or
implied
dealing
with
copyrights.
there
is
a
communication
policy
with
respect
to
catv
clearly
announced
that
it
is
to
lessen
catv's
unfair
competitive
advantage
over
local
broadcaster
which
arise
--
mr.
louis
nizer
this
is
a
quotation
of
it
your
honor.
i
believe
i
have
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
no
this
is
the
regulations
to
repeatedly
and
rules
announced
can
the
first
and
second
order?
no,
the
communications--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
case.
the
catv
has
taken
the
position
your
honor
that
for
the
commission
has
taken
the
position.
the
catv
which
leads
the
phase
for
its
programs
your
honors
the
exclusive
rights
of
the
local
tv
station
to
programs
for
which
it
pays
is
unfair
competition
and
wishes
to
limit
that
in
order
to
increase
the
competitive
opportunity.
i
wish
to
insert
the
other
fact
that
the
legislative
purpose
was
also
to
encourage
uhf
development.
that's
ultra
high
frequency
is
against
very
high
frequency
that
has
70
possibilities
and
this
was
not
making
headway
your
honor
until
the
congress
passed
a
special
statute
requiring
all
television
sets
to
have
uhf
reception
and
you
now
see
it
on
every
television
set.
and
for
a
while
your
honor
uhf
began
to
grow
but
when
the
catv
group,
it
was
preposterous
to
expect
the
uhf
station
to
make
its
investment
and
also
go
into
the
field
in
competition
with
someone
who
got
the
product
free
for
which
uhf
would
have
had
to
pay
a
license.
and
the
commission
stated
clearly
that
the
reason
why
it
was
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
adopt
the
carriage
requirement
which
i
think
was
explained
to
you
your
honors
this
morning,
the
non-duplication
rule
and
the
distant
signal
rule
and
the
reason
for
this
and
here,
i
have
the
quotation
mr.
justice
fortas
was
to
ameliorate
the
risk
the
bargaining
catv
industry
would
have
a
future
adverse
impact
on
television
broadcast
service
both
existing
and
potential.
that's
in
the
second
order
in
725.
in
short
your
honor,
the
commission
emphasized
not
once
but
many
times
that
the
condition
it
was
trying
to
overcome
resulted
from
the
inability
of
the
present
copyrighter
to
enforce
their
rights
with
respect
to
catv.
for
example,
the
commission
said
on
another
occasion
in
the
light
of
the
unequal
footing
on
which
the
broadcasters
and
catv
systems
now
stand.
we
cannot
regard
any
catv
systems
duplication
of
local
programming
via
the
signals
of
distant
stations
is
a
fair
method
of
computation.
that's
also
in
that
order.
i
have
one
more
quotation
on
the
question
you're
asked
your
honor.
the
commission
said
that
“we
cannot
close
our
eyes
to
the
significance
which
the
present
inability
of
program
supplies
to
control
the
availability
of
their
programs
via
catv
has
from
petition
between
catv
and
broadcasting
station.”
now
this
being
the
one
and
only
communication
policy
based
on
the
inability
of
copyright
owners
to
enforce
the
existing
law
against
catv
and
the
consequent
burdens
placed
on
the
commission
by
the
intransigence
of
catv,
how
anomalous
it
is
to
argue
that
it
is
necessary
to
exempt
catv
from
copyright
liability
in
order
to
coalesce
the
communications
policy
with
the
copyright
law.
in
the
petitioners
replied
brief,
he
contends
that
it
is
not
as
reasserted
as
to
policy
and
he
quotes
the
fcc
the
second
order
paragraph
47
to
the
effect
that
quote
--
that
commission
goal
was
to
integrate
catv
service
into
the
national
television
structure
in
such
a
way
as
to
promote
maximum
television
service
to
both
those
who
are
cable
viewers
and
those
dependent
and
off
their
service.
the
petitioner
has
however
omitted
the
very
next
sentence
of
the
passage
which
reads
“the
new
rules
discussed
below,
that's
the
carriage
and
duplication
distant
signal
rules
are
the
minimum
measures
we
believe
to
be
essential
to
ensure
that
catv
continues
to
perform
its
valuable
supplemental
role
without
unduly
damaging
or
impeding
the
growth
of
television
broadcasting
service.”
so
i
repeat
your
honor,
there
is
only
one
catv
communication
policy
with
respect
to
catv
and
it
lends
no
support
to
any
theory
for
an
implied
license.
now
who
would
benefit
from
the
exemption
sought
and
at
whose
expense.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
the
implied
in
law
theory
contrary
to
the
precise
language
giving
us
exclusive
rights
for
every
public
performance
without
limitation
is
a
misnomer
and
as
a
semantic,
wittingly
or
unwittingly
a
semantic
device
to
put
a
good
color
on
an
impossible
concept
in
this
case.
so
we
have
translated
it
to
be
what
it
must
be
even
a
compulsory
license
or
an
exemption.
it
can't
be
anything
else
because
there
is
no
warrant
to
say
under
this
act
that
one
can
apply
on
how
he
make
it
and
with
what
the
guarantees
to
the
owner
to
the
contrary.
now
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
and
i
am
able
to
persuade
you
but
the
briefs
and
the
clarities
will
make
it
rather
clear.
it
isn't
involved
and
refined
subject
matter
not
and
rather
sophisticated
analysis
but
having
made
it
leave
with
this
for
years.
i
may
say
to
you
your
honor,
something
should
be
explained.
this
case
is
six
years
old,
the
defendants
put
in
every
conceivable
defense
which
is
now
put
aside
for
separate
trial.
i
think
your
honors
ought
to
understand
that
legends.
stop
them
because
we
gave
a
license
we
must
have
included
this.
copyrights
are
not
properly
noticed.
it's
claimed
to
be
eligible.
antitrust
law
violation
and
after
six
years
of
delay
during
which
they
were
making
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
we
think
of
unjust
profits.
the
court
finally
--
the
chief
justice
and
the
district
court
said
we
will
put
a
note
to
this
delay
and
we
will
try
this
case
in
separate
sections.
we
will
try
first
the
copyright
infringement,
is
there
one?
and
then
after
we
will
put
aside
implied
license
in
fact
in
other
words
by
giving
a
license
to
the
copyright
--
to
the
station,
have
we
thereby
granted
a
license
to
catv.
they
have
that
issue.
it
will
be
tried
subsequently
your
honor.
and
damages
had
been
put
aside
and
the
law
is
clear
that
there
can
be
no
oppressive
damages
such
as
it's
been
feared
here
and
the
stopple
and
ledges
and
all
the
other
defenses
have
been
put
aside
and
after
six
years,
we
finally
got
to
an
issue
where
we
could
come
to
grips
with
this
question
while
our
copyrights
were
dying
due
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
were
running
out
and
due
to
the
statute
of
limitations
of
three
years
once
you
know
you
have
a
claim
and
everyday
that
goes
fine.
we
lose
those
rights
for
these
arguments
and
it
was
to
stop
that
that
the
courts
split
this
case
into
four
parts
and
many
of
the
matters
which
our
adversary
refers
to,
he
will
have
a
full
day
in
court
after
this
case
is
decided
by
your
honors.
now,
who
would
profit
from
this
exemption?
the
catv
who
never
creates
anything
except
those
159
stations
that
are
beginning
to
originate
programs,
i
think
they
do.
sells
a
product
which
others
have
invested
millions
of
dollars
which
they
appropriate
without
even
a
thank
you,
this
profit
exorbitantly
not
by
virtue
of
skill
but
because
they're
not
paying
on
what
the
merchandise
they
sell
who
frustrate
the
communication
policy
of
encouraging
local
stations
particularly
uhf
which
serve
local
expression.
mr.
louis
nizer
pay
them.
yes
your
honor.
yes.
in
all
and
that
is
why
we
hope
your
honor
they
prosper
and
even
to
begin
to
originate
more
programs
that
will
give
as
an
outlet
of
the
copyright
owners
and
all
the
others
or
the
field
which
we
--
which
the
others
particularly
desperately
need
as
the
briefs
here
indicate.
mr.
louis
nizer
none
at
all.
anymore
your
honor
than
a
local
station
that
receives
by
microwave
a
program
--
this
is
the
way
all
network
works.
there
are
very
few
live
programs
from
the
major
network.
they
put
it
on
tape,
they
send
it
to
your
local
station
here
but
it
just
receives
this
electromagnetic
energy
which
we
talked
about
and
sends
it
out,
rebroadcast
the
same
person.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
is
arranging
the
program
and
it
pays
license
fees
for
everything
that
it
engages
and
then
sends
it
out
by
this
--
the
same
way
and
the
only
difference
is
they
send
it
over
the
air
and
they
send
it
by
wire.
otherwise,
it's
precisely
the
same.
there
are
differences
that
a
broad
--
and
this
was
analyzed
by
the
court,
a
broadcasting
station
goes
to
advertise
at
the
present
time
they
don't
but
there's
nothing
to
stop
them
from
going
to
advertise
and
they
will
as
soon
as
they
originate
programs.
mr.
louis
nizer
they
do
only
in
this
sense
your
honor.
they
denied
that
they
do
attempting
to
make
another
distinction
but
actually,
they
select
from
the
various
different
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
but
you
go
very
far.
for
example,
they
picked
up
pittsburg
and
they
advertised
mr.
justice
warren
asked
about
football,
it
was
a
felicitous
question
in
view
of
the
evidence
here.
they
advertise
--
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
football
and
baseball
games
is
by
coming
to
our
cable
because
no
one
else
will
have
it
due
to
local
conditions
and
restrictions.
mr.
louis
nizer
oh
yes.
they
have
--
they
now
build
them.
it
started
with
three,
five,
they've
gone
to
twelve
and
now
twenty
stations
and
they
select
which
ones
they
want
and
if
the
local
tv
is
not
on
it,
that
station
is
going
to
die
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
that
selection
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
if
they
have
20
channels.
i
suppose
you
could
--
mr.
louis
nizer
if
they
chose
to
you
have,
yes,
on
the
uhf
band
particularly
and
i
suppose
on
the
vhf
13
would
be
the
limit.
you
can't
get
more
than
13.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
they
quite
so.
i
think
they
are
and
your
honor,
the
testimony
was
that
they
even
had
a
poll
taken
of
their
subscribers.
what
do
you
wish?
but
when
the
subscribers
wish
something
which
they
found
was
a
little
more
expensive
to
bring
in,
they
ignored
it
just
the
same
but
there
was
this
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
--
mr.
louis
nizer
oh
yes.
they
do
it
all
the
time
and
they
do
not
only
that
your
honor.
those
--
it
is
far
more
serious
than
that
as
one
of
the
questions
elicited
a
proper
answer
from
counsel.
they
will
convert
the
signal
from
one
to
another.
they
will
change
the
band.
channel
9
will
be
on
their
station
channel
2
if
they
wish.
they
have
the
equipment
with
which
to
do
this
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
more
power
and
get
further
stations
away
for
sending
so
that
the
identity
of
the
station
is
lost
as
well
in
cost
of--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
your
honor.
they
can
pick
whatever
they
wish
off
the
air.
take
it
and
then
send
it
out.
indeed
their
advertising
was
unless
you
subscribe
to
the
clarksburg
station,
you
will
never
get
the
three
big
networks.
we're
the
only
one
who
can
give
it
to
you
and
that
was
true.
now
what
chances
a
copyright
owner
to
sell
his
product
in
clarksburg
to
the
local
tv
station
when
the
local
tv
station
says,
“i'm
hardly
listened
to,
they've
got
the
football
and
other
big
programs
that
i'll
see
in
here
and
i
can't
have
that?”
they
took
full
advantage
of
that
in
their
advertising
and
there
were
letters
of
evidence.
one
of
which
was
by
the
manager
of
a
catv
system
saying,
“we
have
this
baseball
we're
going
to
bring
you
in
here.
it
was
close
to
world
series
time
or
might
have
been
world
series.”
and
our
opponent,
wboy,
the
independent
local
station
is
claiming
that
it's
going
to
get
a
baseball
game
in
here
but
i
don't
see
how
i've
talked
to
these
people,
they're
not
getting
that
license
it's
too
expensive
on
whatever
the
reason
was
and
they
advertise
the
only
way
you're
going
to
get
this
is
by
coming
to
the
catv
system.
i
also
wish
to
point
out
and
i
omitted
to
say
something
which
maybe
helpful
in
my
effort
to
persuade
that
even
if
a
copyright
infringer
does
not
cause
damage.
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
the
profits.
under
the
copyright
law,
it
is
clear
that
if
you
can
recover
either
damager
all
profits,
in
other
words,
the
unjust
enrichments
still
belongs
to
you
even
if
you
haven't
been
heard
and
therefore
even
in
the
local
areas
or
anywhere
else
where
a
intervening
broadcaster
send
even
to
the
same
people,
we,
the
copyright
owners
are
damaged
in
two
ways.
that
is
damaged
by
loss
of
profits
at
least
in
two
ways.
one,
we
have
not
received
part
of
that
royalty
that
we
should
have
gotten
and
secondly
the
local
station
has
been
heard
and
we
have
far
more
difficulty
selling
them
and
indeed
we
can't
at
all.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
there
isn't
--
that's
quite
right.
there
isn't
the
sensitive
relationship
between
audience
which
our
friend
here
argues
and
the
fee.
far
more
significant
in
the
bargaining
process
as
the
evidence
would
show,
this
is
for
later
damages.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
i
must
be
fair
to
say
as
yet.
but
far
more
important
than
merely
audience
at
least
15,000
subscribers
added
to
a
million
viewers,
far
more
important
is
how
many
stations
are
there
in
the
area.
that's
what
creates
the
competition
and
then
it
gives
us
a
chance
to
get
more
money
where
as
one
station,
we
have
very
much
bargaining
power
and
also,
how
much
inventory
have
they
if
the
station
has
bought
motion
pictures
from
warner
brothers
and
united
artist
comes.
it
is
not
a
very
good
position.
so
that
the
economic
factors
here
are
not
--
are
completely
over
simplified
where
it
is
said
just
more
audience,
more
money.
it
doesn't
reflect
itself
that
way
at
all
but
whatever
there
is
to
that,
you'll
have
this
day
in
court
on
that
on
the
question
of
damages
and
applied
license
in
fact
and
double
payment,
all
of
these
issues
that
have
been
raised
here,
he
will
have
his
trial
after
your
honors
decide
this
if
there
is
anything
to
go
to
trial.
now,
i
was
saying
who
is
victimized
by
this
implied
license
of
law
or
exemption
or
whatever
it
is
called.
in
addition
to
all
the
copyright
companies,
owners
that
have
spent
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
for
these
licenses
and
find
that
they're
just
being
taken,
there
are
16,000
actors
in
the
screen
actors
guild
who
is
averaging
from
the
year
it
was
testified
before
the
senate
is
$3000.00
a
year
according
to
charlton
heston
testified.
there
are
3000
writers
of
the
writers
guild
who
depend
upon
their
livelihood
from
television.
the
testimony
is
that
their
largest
income
comes
from
this
broadcast
today,
all
of
these
others.
3300
members
of
the
directors
guild,
16,000
members
of
actor
--
it's
the
union
that
takes
care
of
the
small
mid
players
and
so
on.1
50
composers
of
the
screen
composes,
more
than
10,000
members
of
ascap,
14,000
writers
and
publishers
of
bmi
and
tens
of
thousands
of
musicians
and
thousands
of
other
artists.
they
are
the
ones
who
are
being
deprived.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
would
go
to
the
implied
license
in
fact
that
we've
been
paid.
mr.
louis
nizer
well
--
double
payment
thus
it
is
argued
that
will
be
for
a
trial
and
since
my
time
is
limited,
i
would
like
to
--
if
your
honor
will
excuse
me,
just
very
briefly
reply.
it
is
a
very
involved
subject.
i
think
--
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
appreciate
it
your
honor.
i
haven't
even
touch
the
performance
which
i
did
want
to
address
myself
so
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
briefs.
but
on
this
subject
your
honor,
the
evidence
that
is
now
in
the
record
since
depositions
were
permitted
on
this
subject
even
though
it
was
kept
for
a
separate
trial.
the
evidence
already
in
the
record
in
the
depositions
is
that
we
are
injured
far
more
by
losing
the
local
tv
stations
opportunity
to
purchase
and
we
all
by
any
theoretical
notion
that
because
there
are
more
listeners
or
viewers
that
we
can
get
a
larger
fee.
it
doesn't
work
out
that
way.
it
is
completely
and
the
evidence
also
shows
that
one
of
our
companies
that
invested
money
in
the
--
a
full
group
of
pictures,
copyrights
brought
them
for
this
purpose
has
lost
$10
million
because
it
hasn't
got
the
outlet
that
it
expected
to
have
due
to
catv.
thank
you
your
honor.
