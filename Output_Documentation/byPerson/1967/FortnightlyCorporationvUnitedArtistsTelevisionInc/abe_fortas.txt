justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
the
substance
of
the
situation
is
that
by
your
facilities,
you
to
some
extent
exhibit
that
you're
responsible
for
making
the
motion
picture
available
in
homes
where
it
would
not
otherwise
be
available,
take
your
facilities
that
are
on
the
outer
--
that
are
outside
of
the
--
the
band
they
expect
from
here,
the
service
area.
and
i
suppose
that
it's
arguable
that
that's
what
you're
doing
in
essence,
that
you're
making
available
the
motion
picture
film
to
which
is
the
property
of
somebody
else
to
people
to
whom
it
would
not
otherwise
be
available,
and
that
is
--
and
you're
getting
paid
for
it
and
that
that
is
a
use
of
somebody
else's
property
which
without
too
much
quarreling
and
hair
splitting
can
be
brought
within
a
specific
language
of
the
copyright
act.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
my
position
but
i
say
that
that's
--
i
understand
it
would
be
the
argument
on
the
other
side.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
do
get
kind
of
mixed
up
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
that
thing
i
see
on
the
screen
when
i
go
to
the
movies?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
my
point,
yes
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
could
say
speak
for
yourself
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
way,
what
are
your
charges?
what
are
your
charges
for
this
service?
justice
abe
fortas
a
month?
justice
abe
fortas
then
--
and
that's
the
total
charge?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
were
technologically
possible
and
you
sold
your
service
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
were
technologically
possible
and
you
sold
your
service
to
a
theatre,
and
the
theatre
exhibited
a
motion
picture
that
came
in
over
there
and
exactly
the
way
you
described
charged
admission
for
it.
what
would
be
the
legal
consequences
under
the
copyright
act?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
not
be.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
be
liable
--
you
would
be
infringing
the
copyright
act?
justice
abe
fortas
the
difference
being
that
then
you
would
be
providing
this
service
or
facility
or
whatnot
for
a
public
performance
as
distinguished
from
a
private
performance.
justice
abe
fortas
for
a
private
viewing
or
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
say,
we
believe
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive.
this
is
reinforced
by
the
communications
act
which
says
that
a
broadcast
must
be
intended
for
reception
by
the
public.
in
the
nbc
case,
the
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
the
communications
act
is
the
interest
of
the
listening
public
in
the
greater
and
more
efficient
use
of
radio.
i
assume
today,
the
court
would
speak
of
the
viewing
public
as
well
as
the
listening
public.
nothing
in
the
act
restricts
the
right.
nothing
in
the
laws
restricts
the
right
of
a
member
of
the
public
to
use
any
antenna
it
chooses
for
any
set
he
chooses
for
a
reception
of
a
broadcast.
and
as
i
say,
we
believe
this
is
confirmed
by
the
industry
economics
which
we
offered
a
proof
that
the
broadcaster
has
contemplates
the
audience
which
include
the
community
antenna
subscriber.
the
license
has
been
paid
for
broadcast
to
that
public
and
that
therefore
the
public
should
have
the
right
to
receive.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
a
license
implied
in
law
but
he
limits
the
--
limits
it
to
the
state
--
what
he
calls
the
station
service
area
or
the
b
contour.
he
proposes
this
limit
not
because
this
marks
the
end
of
the
limit
where
you
can
receive
a
broadcast
off
the
air
but
because
it
is
in
his
words
a
good
rule
of
thumb
and
because
and
we
believe
this
is
correct
that
it
is
certain,
there
is
a
map
of
fcc
for
every
station
marking
out
the
contour,
a
contour
and
b
contour.
moreover,
the
commissions
regulations
of
catv
are
geared
to
the
b
contour.
it's
the
station
within
which
the
system
is
located
if
it's
to
b
contour,
it's
known
as
the
local
station.
now
the
commission
has
made
clear
that
catv
provides
an
important
service
in
connection
with
its
allocations
plan
and
in
the
recent
decision
last
february
23rd
in
a
so
called
shen
heist
case,
the
commission
made
clear
what
it
meant
by
that
because
there,
it
ordered
the
community
antenna
to
receive
a
signal
and
to
give
the
station
a
non-duplication
protection
even
though
the
station
did
not
put
a
viewable
signal
in
the
commissions
word
over
any
part
of
the
catv
community.
this
means
that
the
commission
is
regarding
the
community
antennas
as
a
means
of
assuring
service
of
the
stations
and
in
mr.
hyde's
words
under
the
commission's
regulations,
community
antennas
are
providing
the
antenna
service
which
he
regards
as
being
the
proper
service
to
be
provided.
if
a
judicial
limitation
is
to
be
constructed
on
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
people
--
public
to
receive
off
the
air
then
we
agree
that
the
b
contour
is
the
only
reasonable
limit
but
we
point
out
particularly
in
this
case
for
the
receptions
of
the
air
that
all
the
receptions
within
the
b
or
very
near
the
b
involves
no
significant
extension
of
the
area.
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
he
favors
an
interpretation
which
harmonizes
the
copyright
act
and
the
federal
communications
act
and
the
antitrust
laws.
we
believe
that
this
will
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
catv
reception
is
not
performance.
however,
if
it
worked
to
be
held
to
be
performance
then
implying
a
license
brings
about
what
the
solicitor
general
has
called
the
coalescence
of
these
laws
but
he
coalescence
is
only
partial
unless
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
off
the
air
for
surely
there
are
still
the
same
tendency
or
dangers
of
monopolistic
practices
in
the
event
that
the
b
contour
marks
the
limit
because
they're
just
across
the
line
of
the
copyright
owners
control
takes
over,
he
can
substitute
his
systems
of
exclusivity,
can
rollback
the
public's
use
of
catv
for
television
service
and
can
in
short
control,
competing
--
competition
between
stations
for
his
own
benefit
in
exporting
his
copyright
monopoly.
if
there
is
to
be
a
limit
on
the
public's
right
to
receive
and
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
by
the
congress
and
should
not
be
constructed
by
the
court
by
a
strained
expansion
of
the
words
of
the
copyright
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer,
is
there
anything
in
the
pending
copyright
bill
that
deals
with
this
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer.
i
suppose
that
presently
if
it
should
be
held
that
catv
has
to
imply
copyright
laws
if
that
would
mean
that
if
your
plan
for
example
did
not
want
to
permit
them
to
show
use
to
transmit,
propagate
or
whatever
it
may
be
any
particular
film
that
you
own
that
you
could
withhold
permission.
and
then
they'd
have
to
blackout
that
part
of
the
program?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
you
that
mr.
nizer.
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
could
refuse
to
permit
a
catv
to
utilize
a
film
to
which
you
own
a
copyright.
justice
abe
fortas
now
how
much
is
any
instrument
in
this
record
or
can
you
give
us
any
idea
about
how
much
of
a
station's
programming,
daily
programming
handled
by
catv
system
would
be
subject
to
copyright
if
it's
--
if
we
decide
in
your
favor?
i
assume
the
principle
would
apply
not
only
to
motion
pictures
but
to
any
type
of
original
production.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
two
questions
facing
catv
if
we
should
agree
with
you.
one
is
whether
they
can
get
the
permission
from
the
copyright
owner
of
this
50%
of
the
material
and
the
other
is
at
what
price?
justice
abe
fortas
and
just
assume
not
a
picture
like
a
history
of
motion
picture
distribution
with
which
we're
all
familiar.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer,
i
hope
you
will
indulge
me
of
one
further
thing.
i
hope
before
you
finish
that
you
will
comment
on
the
solicitor
general's
decision.
i
tend
to
in
depth.
the
solicitor
general
incidentally
so
far
as
this
issue
was
concern,
stated
in
the
southwest
cable
company
brief
just
argued
before
your
honors
stating
in
the
commissions
view.
this
extension
of
signal
by
catv
directly
affects
its
basic
plan
for
allocating
free
television
service
throughout
united
states.
now
catv
presents
itself
as
“predominantly
oriented
toward
smaller
systems
in
smaller
size
communities”
your
honor
for
that
repeated
by
mr.
barnard.
in
giving
the
impression
to
this
in
capable
of
coping
with
the
giant
broadcasting
industry
and
therefore
the
potential
victim
of
anti
competitive
pressures,
the
fact
is
that
catv
operators
now
include
the
largest
industrial
complexes
in
the
united
states
such
general
electric,
westinghouse,
time
life,
western
union,
apco,
scripts
howard,
general
telephone
and
electrics
used
aircraft
company
and
many
others.
and
multiple
ownership
is
common
25
owners
controls
671
franchises
with
394
applications
pending
in
1966.
catv
national
executives
therefore
have
taken
the
position
now
that
they
are
far
more
responsible
executives
in
the
industry
representing
these
large
companies
that
they
do
not
object.
they
have
made
public
statements
on
it
which
is
quoting
in
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
by
director
of
cox
broadcasting
one
of
the
large
catv
operators
and
a
director
of
the
national
association
of
which
he
said
a
recent
court
ruling
implies
that
the
catv
operators
maybe
required
to
pay
fees
for
the
privilege
of
transmitting
copyrighted
material
to
cable
television
subscribers.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
would
impose
a
critical
financial
burden
of
the
operators
in
our
opinion.
the
answer
--
the
alarm
is
not
warranted.
copyright
fees
are
a
normal
cost
of
doing
business
in
many
fields
and
as
in
radio
and
television
today,
they
would
constitute
a
relatively
small
element
in
their
total
cost
of
providing
a
service
desired.
there
is
therefore
no
fear
in
the
industry
actually
except
this
counsel
attempts
to
present
it
that
paying
a
fair
minor
portion
of
their
unjust
enrichment
as
we
view
it
to
the
artist
who
create
the
material
within
any
way
sacrificed
their
position.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
southwestern
cable
brief
says,
“catv
poses
a
genuine
threat
to
potential
harm
to
the
public
interest
and
possible
frustration
of
congress'
goal.”
it
is
now
your
honors
concentrating
in
the
large
settings.
it
is
not
giving
the
service
which
originates
this
practice.
if
for
example,
it
has
committed
itself
according
to
the
testimony
to
$16
million
for
catv
system
in
denver.
$37
million
in
philadelphia
and
it
is
estimated
that
there
will
be
a
$30
million
annual
income
from
one
borrows
in
manhattan,
in
new
york.
it
is
against
this
background
your
honors,
so
different
from
the
miniature
depiction
of
the
petition
that
we
turn
to
his
argument
for
an
applied
license
in
law.
we
shall
assume
for
this
discussion
as
the
petitioner
must
arguendo
when
he
argues
for
an
applied
license
that
a
catv
transmission
is
a
performance
under
the
copyright
law
and
i
shall
as
time
permits
later
deal
with
that
question.
but
assuming
a
performance
is
there
an
implied
license
of
law
in
favor
of
catv
which
exempts
it
from
being
an
infringer
under
the
copyright
law.
the
district
court
in
its
scholarly
opinion
said
there
was
no
implied
license
in
law
concluding
“neither
the
policy
nor
language
of
the
federal
communications
act
nor
its
regulations
are
intended
to
or
have
the
effect
of
repealing
or
modifying
section
1
of
the
copyright
law.”
the
court
finds
no
basis
for
concluding
that
defendant
is
the
beneficiary
of
any
license
implied
in
law.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
specifically
residing,
rejecting
the
theory
of
double
payment
as
a
justification
for
an
applied
license
in
law.
it
concluded
“a
resolution
of
such
issues
of
broadcasting
economics
has
not
been
entrusted
to
the
courts
through
the
copyright
act.”
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
the
courts
below
that
they
can
be
no
implied
license
applicable
to
all
programs
“whatever
their
source
and
wherever
reproduced”.
he
stresses
that
such
an
implied
license
in
law
“would
be
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
terms
of
the
statute
of
the
copyright
law
but
also
with
existing
precedence
and
with
its
own
policy”.
and
one
would
think
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
after
this
correct
statement
of
the
law
to
have
any
differences
with
the
learned
solicitor
general.
but
surprisingly,
he
abandons
his
statement
--
this
statement
of
the
law
fully
supported
by
all
the
authorities
onto
which
there
is
not
a
single
exception
to
suggest
that
there
should
be
an
exception
that
this
court
should
create
a
unprecedented
implied
license
in
law
for
a
catv
transmission
with
the
broadcasting
stations
within
the
broadcasting
stations
grade
b
contour.
let
us
examine
this
suggestion
legally
and
then
in
terms
of
alleged
economic
realities
which
spawned
this
hybrid
concept.
the
copyright
law
grants
to
the
copyright
owner,
exclusive
right
not
merely
to
one
public
performance
or
to
any
limited
number
of
performances.
but
as
this
court
phrased
it
expressly
to
all
public
performances
for
profit
without
limitation,
a
copyright
infringement
does
not
depend
on
the
pleas
of
the
performance.
to
grant
upon
the
statute
unequivocal,
unambiguous
and
absolute
grant
of
right
to
the
copyright
owner,
a
limitation
of
such
right
is
the
privilege
only
of
the
legislature.
it
is
a
strange
and
dangerous
doctrine
the
preaches
that
an
active
congress
maybe
improper
appealed
or
modified
by
the
court
as
justice
holmes
put
that
the
law
is
not
approving
under
presence
in
the
sky.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
quite
--
that
is
--
i
don't
understand
his
position
but
as
well
as
i
can
understand
it,
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
a
television
station
duly
licensed
and
to
--
and
duly
authorized
to
broadcast
the
copyrighted
material.
that
the
substance
of
that
is
that
it
maybe
transmitted
for
a
reception
in
the
home
etcetera
within
certain
areas
as
the
a
contour
and
the
b
contour
and
that
the
catv
service
merely
results
in
providing
the
material
of
presumably
more
satisfactory
basis
within
those
same
contours
but
if
the
catv
service
goes
outside
of
the
intended
license
covered
by
the
copyright
fee
then
the
catv
does
not
have
an
implied
license.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
his
position,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
the
--
perhaps
that's
right.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor.
i
say
that
reception
is
never
an
infringement
under
the
copyright
law.
all
the
spheres
that
somebody
will
be
held
contributing
an
infringement
by
receiving
or
seeing
it,
never
--
the
statute
forbids
performance
and
when
there
is
a
performance,
a
second
or
a
third
by
an
intervener
such
as
catv
who
makes
a
profit
there
from
unless
he
too
pays
a
reasonable
license
fee
under
the
section
of
the
act,
he
is
receiving
an
unjust
enrichment
and
that
the
uniform
law
on
this
subject
is
that
they
can
be
multiple
performances,
multiple
collections
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
indeed
in
this
particular
industry
at
a
significant
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
syndicated
material
which
goes
out
again
and
again
and
again,
it's
called
syndicated
on
local
stations,
is
the
only
source
from
which
the
cost
of
the
program
is
finally
recoup.
but
first,
the
evidence
is
that
the
first
rate
showing
does
not
recoup
the
cost
and
that
the
testimony
is
clear
that
if
a
writer
or
a
director
all
of
whom
exhibit
amicus
curiae
briefs
with
statistics
in
this
matter
unless
he
can
receive
this
repeated
revenues
from
subsequent
showings
in
any
area,
the
b
or
a
area
aside
from
difficulties,
i
will
address
myself
too
as
to
what
is
a
b
area
and
what
the
solicitor
general
suggest
as
a
case
by
case
determination
of
this
in
the
courts
which
would
create
a
flood
of
litigation
was
not
without
guidelines
of
any
kind.
aside
from
that,
we
do
take
the
position
that
even
within
any
area,
a
future
subsequent
choice
from
which
a
profit
is
made
entitles
the
author,
the
creator
the
work
with
the
awesome
background
of
article
i
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
promote
the
odds
that
it
entitles
him
to
some
share
and
i
call
respectfully
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that
clearly
declared?
justice
abe
fortas
from
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
we
have
before
us
in
the
proceeding
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
suggesting
--
are
you
suggesting
mr.
nizer
that
they
can
--
catv
can
pick
an
individual
program
such
as
an
individual
football
game
from
a
station
and
not
carrying
the
entire
station
program?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
i
understand,
it
is
that
--
they
can
hold
of
a
particular
catv
system
it
does
not
customarily
carry
the
programs
of
television
station
x.
it
can
and
does
on
occasion
carry
a
particular
program
that
originates
with
station
x.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
really
just
a
letter
in
it
because
let's
assume
that
a
television
station
who
is
your
licensee
completely
saturated
an
area,
you
don't
get
anymore
for
your
copyright,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
on
the
other
end,
it
maybe
that
the
question
is,
that
didn't
quite
shape
up
that
way
mr.
nizer
because
i
would
assume
that
it
should
be
established
that
your
product
and
the
product
of
these
artists
is
being
disseminated
not
only
by
a
television
station
but
also
by
some
other
instrumentality
that
your
fees
would
take
that
into
account
just
as
i
should
think
that
maybe
the
advertisers
on
the
television
station
are
more
concerned
about
the
number
of
people
to
whom
their
advertising
is
exposed
and
whether
it's
exposed
to
the
potential
consumer
and
picks
it
up
directly
from
the
station
or
through
the
intervention
of
catv.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
goes
to
a
lot
more
than
implied
licensing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
see.
what
is
the
specific
answer
to
this
specific
question?
justice
abe
fortas
is
your
system
capable
of
doing
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
suppose
that
you
irregularly
providing
your
subscribers
with
the
service
of
--
from
three
stations,
could
you
pick
a
program
from
the
fourth?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
would
be
possible?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
say
you've
never
done
it?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
entire
broadcast,
you
mean
the
entire
programming
of
a
station
for
the
entire
day?
justice
abe
fortas
and
for
seven
days
in
a
week?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
the
substance
of
the
situation
is
that
by
your
facilities,
you
to
some
extent
exhibit
that
you're
responsible
for
making
the
motion
picture
available
in
homes
where
it
would
not
otherwise
be
available,
take
your
facilities
that
are
on
the
outer
--
that
are
outside
of
the
--
the
band
they
expect
from
here,
the
service
area.
and
i
suppose
that
it's
arguable
that
that's
what
you're
doing
in
essence,
that
you're
making
available
the
motion
picture
film
to
which
is
the
property
of
somebody
else
to
people
to
whom
it
would
not
otherwise
be
available,
and
that
is
--
and
you're
getting
paid
for
it
and
that
that
is
a
use
of
somebody
else's
property
which
without
too
much
quarreling
and
hair
splitting
can
be
brought
within
a
specific
language
of
the
copyright
act.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
my
position
but
i
say
that
that's
--
i
understand
it
would
be
the
argument
on
the
other
side.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
do
get
kind
of
mixed
up
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
that
thing
i
see
on
the
screen
when
i
go
to
the
movies?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
my
point,
yes
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
could
say
speak
for
yourself
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
way,
what
are
your
charges?
what
are
your
charges
for
this
service?
justice
abe
fortas
a
month?
justice
abe
fortas
then
--
and
that's
the
total
charge?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
were
technologically
possible
and
you
sold
your
service
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
were
technologically
possible
and
you
sold
your
service
to
a
theatre,
and
the
theatre
exhibited
a
motion
picture
that
came
in
over
there
and
exactly
the
way
you
described
charged
admission
for
it.
what
would
be
the
legal
consequences
under
the
copyright
act?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
not
be.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
be
liable
--
you
would
be
infringing
the
copyright
act?
justice
abe
fortas
the
difference
being
that
then
you
would
be
providing
this
service
or
facility
or
whatnot
for
a
public
performance
as
distinguished
from
a
private
performance.
justice
abe
fortas
for
a
private
viewing
or
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
say,
we
believe
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive.
this
is
reinforced
by
the
communications
act
which
says
that
a
broadcast
must
be
intended
for
reception
by
the
public.
in
the
nbc
case,
the
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
the
communications
act
is
the
interest
of
the
listening
public
in
the
greater
and
more
efficient
use
of
radio.
i
assume
today,
the
court
would
speak
of
the
viewing
public
as
well
as
the
listening
public.
nothing
in
the
act
restricts
the
right.
nothing
in
the
laws
restricts
the
right
of
a
member
of
the
public
to
use
any
antenna
it
chooses
for
any
set
he
chooses
for
a
reception
of
a
broadcast.
and
as
i
say,
we
believe
this
is
confirmed
by
the
industry
economics
which
we
offered
a
proof
that
the
broadcaster
has
contemplates
the
audience
which
include
the
community
antenna
subscriber.
the
license
has
been
paid
for
broadcast
to
that
public
and
that
therefore
the
public
should
have
the
right
to
receive.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
a
license
implied
in
law
but
he
limits
the
--
limits
it
to
the
state
--
what
he
calls
the
station
service
area
or
the
b
contour.
he
proposes
this
limit
not
because
this
marks
the
end
of
the
limit
where
you
can
receive
a
broadcast
off
the
air
but
because
it
is
in
his
words
a
good
rule
of
thumb
and
because
and
we
believe
this
is
correct
that
it
is
certain,
there
is
a
map
of
fcc
for
every
station
marking
out
the
contour,
a
contour
and
b
contour.
moreover,
the
commissions
regulations
of
catv
are
geared
to
the
b
contour.
it's
the
station
within
which
the
system
is
located
if
it's
to
b
contour,
it's
known
as
the
local
station.
now
the
commission
has
made
clear
that
catv
provides
an
important
service
in
connection
with
its
allocations
plan
and
in
the
recent
decision
last
february
23rd
in
a
so
called
shen
heist
case,
the
commission
made
clear
what
it
meant
by
that
because
there,
it
ordered
the
community
antenna
to
receive
a
signal
and
to
give
the
station
a
non-duplication
protection
even
though
the
station
did
not
put
a
viewable
signal
in
the
commissions
word
over
any
part
of
the
catv
community.
this
means
that
the
commission
is
regarding
the
community
antennas
as
a
means
of
assuring
service
of
the
stations
and
in
mr.
hyde's
words
under
the
commission's
regulations,
community
antennas
are
providing
the
antenna
service
which
he
regards
as
being
the
proper
service
to
be
provided.
if
a
judicial
limitation
is
to
be
constructed
on
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
people
--
public
to
receive
off
the
air
then
we
agree
that
the
b
contour
is
the
only
reasonable
limit
but
we
point
out
particularly
in
this
case
for
the
receptions
of
the
air
that
all
the
receptions
within
the
b
or
very
near
the
b
involves
no
significant
extension
of
the
area.
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
he
favors
an
interpretation
which
harmonizes
the
copyright
act
and
the
federal
communications
act
and
the
antitrust
laws.
we
believe
that
this
will
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
catv
reception
is
not
performance.
however,
if
it
worked
to
be
held
to
be
performance
then
implying
a
license
brings
about
what
the
solicitor
general
has
called
the
coalescence
of
these
laws
but
he
coalescence
is
only
partial
unless
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
off
the
air
for
surely
there
are
still
the
same
tendency
or
dangers
of
monopolistic
practices
in
the
event
that
the
b
contour
marks
the
limit
because
they're
just
across
the
line
of
the
copyright
owners
control
takes
over,
he
can
substitute
his
systems
of
exclusivity,
can
rollback
the
public's
use
of
catv
for
television
service
and
can
in
short
control,
competing
--
competition
between
stations
for
his
own
benefit
in
exporting
his
copyright
monopoly.
if
there
is
to
be
a
limit
on
the
public's
right
to
receive
and
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
by
the
congress
and
should
not
be
constructed
by
the
court
by
a
strained
expansion
of
the
words
of
the
copyright
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer,
is
there
anything
in
the
pending
copyright
bill
that
deals
with
this
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer.
i
suppose
that
presently
if
it
should
be
held
that
catv
has
to
imply
copyright
laws
if
that
would
mean
that
if
your
plan
for
example
did
not
want
to
permit
them
to
show
use
to
transmit,
propagate
or
whatever
it
may
be
any
particular
film
that
you
own
that
you
could
withhold
permission.
and
then
they'd
have
to
blackout
that
part
of
the
program?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
you
that
mr.
nizer.
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
could
refuse
to
permit
a
catv
to
utilize
a
film
to
which
you
own
a
copyright.
justice
abe
fortas
now
how
much
is
any
instrument
in
this
record
or
can
you
give
us
any
idea
about
how
much
of
a
station's
programming,
daily
programming
handled
by
catv
system
would
be
subject
to
copyright
if
it's
--
if
we
decide
in
your
favor?
i
assume
the
principle
would
apply
not
only
to
motion
pictures
but
to
any
type
of
original
production.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
two
questions
facing
catv
if
we
should
agree
with
you.
one
is
whether
they
can
get
the
permission
from
the
copyright
owner
of
this
50%
of
the
material
and
the
other
is
at
what
price?
justice
abe
fortas
and
just
assume
not
a
picture
like
a
history
of
motion
picture
distribution
with
which
we're
all
familiar.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nizer,
i
hope
you
will
indulge
me
of
one
further
thing.
i
hope
before
you
finish
that
you
will
comment
on
the
solicitor
general's
decision.
i
tend
to
in
depth.
the
solicitor
general
incidentally
so
far
as
this
issue
was
concern,
stated
in
the
southwest
cable
company
brief
just
argued
before
your
honors
stating
in
the
commissions
view.
this
extension
of
signal
by
catv
directly
affects
its
basic
plan
for
allocating
free
television
service
throughout
united
states.
now
catv
presents
itself
as
“predominantly
oriented
toward
smaller
systems
in
smaller
size
communities”
your
honor
for
that
repeated
by
mr.
barnard.
in
giving
the
impression
to
this
in
capable
of
coping
with
the
giant
broadcasting
industry
and
therefore
the
potential
victim
of
anti
competitive
pressures,
the
fact
is
that
catv
operators
now
include
the
largest
industrial
complexes
in
the
united
states
such
general
electric,
westinghouse,
time
life,
western
union,
apco,
scripts
howard,
general
telephone
and
electrics
used
aircraft
company
and
many
others.
and
multiple
ownership
is
common
25
owners
controls
671
franchises
with
394
applications
pending
in
1966.
catv
national
executives
therefore
have
taken
the
position
now
that
they
are
far
more
responsible
executives
in
the
industry
representing
these
large
companies
that
they
do
not
object.
they
have
made
public
statements
on
it
which
is
quoting
in
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
by
director
of
cox
broadcasting
one
of
the
large
catv
operators
and
a
director
of
the
national
association
of
which
he
said
a
recent
court
ruling
implies
that
the
catv
operators
maybe
required
to
pay
fees
for
the
privilege
of
transmitting
copyrighted
material
to
cable
television
subscribers.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
would
impose
a
critical
financial
burden
of
the
operators
in
our
opinion.
the
answer
--
the
alarm
is
not
warranted.
copyright
fees
are
a
normal
cost
of
doing
business
in
many
fields
and
as
in
radio
and
television
today,
they
would
constitute
a
relatively
small
element
in
their
total
cost
of
providing
a
service
desired.
there
is
therefore
no
fear
in
the
industry
actually
except
this
counsel
attempts
to
present
it
that
paying
a
fair
minor
portion
of
their
unjust
enrichment
as
we
view
it
to
the
artist
who
create
the
material
within
any
way
sacrificed
their
position.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
southwestern
cable
brief
says,
“catv
poses
a
genuine
threat
to
potential
harm
to
the
public
interest
and
possible
frustration
of
congress'
goal.”
it
is
now
your
honors
concentrating
in
the
large
settings.
it
is
not
giving
the
service
which
originates
this
practice.
if
for
example,
it
has
committed
itself
according
to
the
testimony
to
$16
million
for
catv
system
in
denver.
$37
million
in
philadelphia
and
it
is
estimated
that
there
will
be
a
$30
million
annual
income
from
one
borrows
in
manhattan,
in
new
york.
it
is
against
this
background
your
honors,
so
different
from
the
miniature
depiction
of
the
petition
that
we
turn
to
his
argument
for
an
applied
license
in
law.
we
shall
assume
for
this
discussion
as
the
petitioner
must
arguendo
when
he
argues
for
an
applied
license
that
a
catv
transmission
is
a
performance
under
the
copyright
law
and
i
shall
as
time
permits
later
deal
with
that
question.
but
assuming
a
performance
is
there
an
implied
license
of
law
in
favor
of
catv
which
exempts
it
from
being
an
infringer
under
the
copyright
law.
the
district
court
in
its
scholarly
opinion
said
there
was
no
implied
license
in
law
concluding
“neither
the
policy
nor
language
of
the
federal
communications
act
nor
its
regulations
are
intended
to
or
have
the
effect
of
repealing
or
modifying
section
1
of
the
copyright
law.”
the
court
finds
no
basis
for
concluding
that
defendant
is
the
beneficiary
of
any
license
implied
in
law.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
specifically
residing,
rejecting
the
theory
of
double
payment
as
a
justification
for
an
applied
license
in
law.
it
concluded
“a
resolution
of
such
issues
of
broadcasting
economics
has
not
been
entrusted
to
the
courts
through
the
copyright
act.”
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
the
courts
below
that
they
can
be
no
implied
license
applicable
to
all
programs
“whatever
their
source
and
wherever
reproduced”.
he
stresses
that
such
an
implied
license
in
law
“would
be
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
terms
of
the
statute
of
the
copyright
law
but
also
with
existing
precedence
and
with
its
own
policy”.
and
one
would
think
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
after
this
correct
statement
of
the
law
to
have
any
differences
with
the
learned
solicitor
general.
but
surprisingly,
he
abandons
his
statement
--
this
statement
of
the
law
fully
supported
by
all
the
authorities
onto
which
there
is
not
a
single
exception
to
suggest
that
there
should
be
an
exception
that
this
court
should
create
a
unprecedented
implied
license
in
law
for
a
catv
transmission
with
the
broadcasting
stations
within
the
broadcasting
stations
grade
b
contour.
let
us
examine
this
suggestion
legally
and
then
in
terms
of
alleged
economic
realities
which
spawned
this
hybrid
concept.
the
copyright
law
grants
to
the
copyright
owner,
exclusive
right
not
merely
to
one
public
performance
or
to
any
limited
number
of
performances.
but
as
this
court
phrased
it
expressly
to
all
public
performances
for
profit
without
limitation,
a
copyright
infringement
does
not
depend
on
the
pleas
of
the
performance.
to
grant
upon
the
statute
unequivocal,
unambiguous
and
absolute
grant
of
right
to
the
copyright
owner,
a
limitation
of
such
right
is
the
privilege
only
of
the
legislature.
it
is
a
strange
and
dangerous
doctrine
the
preaches
that
an
active
congress
maybe
improper
appealed
or
modified
by
the
court
as
justice
holmes
put
that
the
law
is
not
approving
under
presence
in
the
sky.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
quite
--
that
is
--
i
don't
understand
his
position
but
as
well
as
i
can
understand
it,
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
a
television
station
duly
licensed
and
to
--
and
duly
authorized
to
broadcast
the
copyrighted
material.
that
the
substance
of
that
is
that
it
maybe
transmitted
for
a
reception
in
the
home
etcetera
within
certain
areas
as
the
a
contour
and
the
b
contour
and
that
the
catv
service
merely
results
in
providing
the
material
of
presumably
more
satisfactory
basis
within
those
same
contours
but
if
the
catv
service
goes
outside
of
the
intended
license
covered
by
the
copyright
fee
then
the
catv
does
not
have
an
implied
license.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
his
position,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
the
--
perhaps
that's
right.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor.
i
say
that
reception
is
never
an
infringement
under
the
copyright
law.
all
the
spheres
that
somebody
will
be
held
contributing
an
infringement
by
receiving
or
seeing
it,
never
--
the
statute
forbids
performance
and
when
there
is
a
performance,
a
second
or
a
third
by
an
intervener
such
as
catv
who
makes
a
profit
there
from
unless
he
too
pays
a
reasonable
license
fee
under
the
section
of
the
act,
he
is
receiving
an
unjust
enrichment
and
that
the
uniform
law
on
this
subject
is
that
they
can
be
multiple
performances,
multiple
collections
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
indeed
in
this
particular
industry
at
a
significant
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
syndicated
material
which
goes
out
again
and
again
and
again,
it's
called
syndicated
on
local
stations,
is
the
only
source
from
which
the
cost
of
the
program
is
finally
recoup.
but
first,
the
evidence
is
that
the
first
rate
showing
does
not
recoup
the
cost
and
that
the
testimony
is
clear
that
if
a
writer
or
a
director
all
of
whom
exhibit
amicus
curiae
briefs
with
statistics
in
this
matter
unless
he
can
receive
this
repeated
revenues
from
subsequent
showings
in
any
area,
the
b
or
a
area
aside
from
difficulties,
i
will
address
myself
too
as
to
what
is
a
b
area
and
what
the
solicitor
general
suggest
as
a
case
by
case
determination
of
this
in
the
courts
which
would
create
a
flood
of
litigation
was
not
without
guidelines
of
any
kind.
aside
from
that,
we
do
take
the
position
that
even
within
any
area,
a
future
subsequent
choice
from
which
a
profit
is
made
entitles
the
author,
the
creator
the
work
with
the
awesome
background
of
article
i
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
promote
the
odds
that
it
entitles
him
to
some
share
and
i
call
respectfully
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that
clearly
declared?
justice
abe
fortas
from
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
we
have
before
us
in
the
proceeding
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
suggesting
--
are
you
suggesting
mr.
nizer
that
they
can
--
catv
can
pick
an
individual
program
such
as
an
individual
football
game
from
a
station
and
not
carrying
the
entire
station
program?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
i
understand,
it
is
that
--
they
can
hold
of
a
particular
catv
system
it
does
not
customarily
carry
the
programs
of
television
station
x.
it
can
and
does
on
occasion
carry
a
particular
program
that
originates
with
station
x.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
really
just
a
letter
in
it
because
let's
assume
that
a
television
station
who
is
your
licensee
completely
saturated
an
area,
you
don't
get
anymore
for
your
copyright,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
on
the
other
end,
it
maybe
that
the
question
is,
that
didn't
quite
shape
up
that
way
mr.
nizer
because
i
would
assume
that
it
should
be
established
that
your
product
and
the
product
of
these
artists
is
being
disseminated
not
only
by
a
television
station
but
also
by
some
other
instrumentality
that
your
fees
would
take
that
into
account
just
as
i
should
think
that
maybe
the
advertisers
on
the
television
station
are
more
concerned
about
the
number
of
people
to
whom
their
advertising
is
exposed
and
whether
it's
exposed
to
the
potential
consumer
and
picks
it
up
directly
from
the
station
or
through
the
intervention
of
catv.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
goes
to
a
lot
more
than
implied
licensing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
see.
what
is
the
specific
answer
to
this
specific
question?
justice
abe
fortas
is
your
system
capable
of
doing
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
suppose
that
you
irregularly
providing
your
subscribers
with
the
service
of
--
from
three
stations,
could
you
pick
a
program
from
the
fourth?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
would
be
possible?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
say
you've
never
done
it?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
entire
broadcast,
you
mean
the
entire
programming
of
a
station
for
the
entire
day?
justice
abe
fortas
and
for
seven
days
in
a
week?
