justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
every
subscriber
could
have
afforded
it,
they
could
have
put
up
their
own
antenna.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
give
a
--
don't
you
give
the
signal
a
little
more
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnard,
could
you
just
address
yourself
one
more
moment
to
--
what
you
actually
do?
don't
you,
as
well
as
amplify
signals,
also
convert
them
from
one
frequency
to
another
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
considerably
more
with
your
antenna
system
than
the
ordinary
set
owner
does
with
his.
he
takes
it
off
the
air
--
he
either
takes
it
off
the
air
the
way
it
comes
or
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
that
you
can't
amp
--
you
say
you
can
strengthen
the
signal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
strengthen
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
mr.
barnard,
you
will
deal
with
the
situation
where
there
is
a
licensed
television
station
in
a
city,
and
that
licensed
television
receives
a
network
program
and
does
nothing
with
the
signal
it
receives
by
microwave
relay
or
whatever
it
is.
it
receives
the
signal
and
retransmits
it
to
the
public
who
take
it
into
their
sets
and
watch
it,
and
the
station
doesn't
do
anything
to
the
signal
at
all
except
retransmit
it,
i
gather.
and
if
the
program
has
a
copyrighted
work
in
it,
does
that
station
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
are
they
doing
that
you
aren't
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
both
the
originating
station
and
the,
say
originates
in
new
york
it
would
be
that
the
station
of
new
york
has
to
pay
and
the
station
of
pittsburgh?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
pays?
who's
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
the
stations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
there's
--
the
programs
originate
in
the
station
and
is
carried
to
another
station,
and
that
station
in
other
words
--
will
both
stations
pay
in
other
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
then
in
terms
of
the
physical
activities
that
he
goes
through,
he
gives
it
very
difficult
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
one
for
sound
and
the
--
doesn't
have
to
be
in
this
--
it
would
be
the
licensed
station
that
it's
consummate?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
get
to
say
is
the
same
thing
about
your
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
client
owned
all
the
television
sets,
it
would
be
like
the
hotel
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
barnard,
i
suppose
that
under
those
decisions
below
that
if
you
just
--
if
your
equipment
has
made
a
mistake
and
you
then
put
out
a
perfectly
good
signal
but
it
just
had
to
be
a
signal
that
your
subscribers
did
receive
in
their
sets,
somebody
else
might
have
been
able
to
receive
it
that
there
would
still
be
infringement.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
--
what
if
you
have
to
comply
with
the
fcc
rules,
you
taped
a
program
for
delayed
delivery
to
your
customers
in
a
couple
of
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
they
--
i
thought
that
they
prevented
duplicating
local
programs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
the
catv
people
ever
taped
and
--
for
delayed
delivery?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
did,
i
suppose
then
you
have
it
over
a
different
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
perhaps
the
basis
for
say
that
the
private
set
owner
is
not
liable
for
an
infringement.is
it
on
the
implied
license
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
that
if
the
gentleman
has
sold
him
and
installed
the
antenna,
he's
subject
to
the
rule
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
mr.
nizer,
the
hotel
also
own
the
equipment
at
the
end
of
the
line
that
which
actually
made
the
sounds
or
the
pictures
of
what
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
could
you
tell
me
what
your
basis
is
for
saying
that
the
home
owner
that
turns
on
his
set
and
invites
the
people
in
to
watch
some
show
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it's
not
an
infringer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
why
isn't
that
a
performance?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
just
say
it's
because
of
the
reception.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
i
had
a
television
--
a
large
television
screen
in
my
house
and
i
made
a
regular
practice
of
charging
to
come
over
and
watch
a
--
watching
programs
and
people
did.
they
came
in
and
paid
a
dollar
of
every
sunday
afternoon.
they
paid
me
a
dollar.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
reception
come
to
be
a
performance?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
all
you
did
is
turn
on
and
switch.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
receive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
even
mention
reception,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nizer,
i
think
that
those
stations
that
you
suggest
are
--
have
began
to
originate
programs
if
they
use
a
copyright
at
work,
they
do
pay
their
royalties.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
if
you
do
â€“
i
gather
you
don't
see
any
difference
though
between
the
station
that
originates
and
the
station
that
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
station
it
originates
is
doing
a
lot
of
things
different
in
addition
to
what
the
non-originated
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
catv
system
such
as
the
petitioners
here
--
don't
they
actually
make
a
selection
of
the
program
that
they're
going
to
give
to
their
subscribers?
justice
byron
r.
white
stations
that's
within
the
range
of
their
equipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
simultaneously
on
their
cable
have
more
than
one
program,
i
gather
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
programs
if
i
will
subscribe
with
their
service
and
say
in
the
primetime
in
the
evening,
how
many
different
programs
could
i
get
off
with
their
cable.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
chose
to
send
you
20
different
stations,
you
have
20.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
there
were.let's
assume
there
were
20
stations
within
the
range
of
this
catv
system
and
they
just
--
but
they
just
chose
to
retransmit
or
whatever
they
do,
three
of
them.
so
they
are
selecting
a
program
in
that
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
every
subscriber
could
have
afforded
it,
they
could
have
put
up
their
own
antenna.
justice
byron
r.
white
but

justice
