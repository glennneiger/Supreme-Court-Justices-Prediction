mr.
robert
c.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent,
plaintiff
below
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
licensing
films
and
cartoons
to
television
stations
to
be
broadcasted
by
those
stations.
the
petitioner
on
two
community
antenna
systems
is
charged
with
copyright
infringement
by
reason
of
the
reception
of
the
broadcasts
of
the
movies
and
cartoons
by
the
stations
licensed
by
the
respondent.
there
are
two
basic
issues
on
this
appeal.
first
is
the
reception
of
a
broadcast
signaled
by
the
petitioner,
catv,
and
the
transmission
or
the
conducting
of
that
signal
by
wire
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
without
sight
or
sound
being
involved
a
performance
in
public
of
the
copyrighted
works
within
the
meaning
of
sections
1
(c)
and
1
(d)
of
the
copyrighter.
the
second
and
related
issue
is
whether
when
a
broadcast
has
been
licensed
by
a
copyright
owner,
as
it
has
been
here.
a
member
of
the
public
has
a
license
implied
in
law
under
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
to
receive
off
the
air
and
enjoy
the
authorized
broadcast
by
the
use
of
a
receiving
antenna
of
his
choice,
including
subscribing
to
the
service
of
a
community
antenna.
petitioner's
two
community
antenna
systems
were
located
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont,
west
virginia,
two
towns
in
--.
just
by
west
virginia
is
hilly,
rugged,
and
mountainous.
in
1952
when
the
systems
began,
the
only
television
stations
in
the
area
were
in
pittsburgh
and
in
johnstown,
pennsylvania.
in
1953,
the
stations
in
wheeling,
west
virginia
and
steubenville,
ohio
began
broadcasting.
they
were
--
these
were
the
only
stations
that
the
people
in
this
area
had
from
which
they
could
get
any
television
service.
these
stations
were
some
distance
away
from
clarksburg
and
fairmont.
they're
some
50
to
65
miles
from
fairmont
and
a
little
bit
farther
from
clarksburg.
as
i
said,
the
area
here
is
mountainous
and
the
towns
are
in
hilly
areas.
most
of
the
houses
are
in
valleys
but
there
are
also
houses
and
people
who
live
on
the
hills
and
in
and
around
the
towns.
this
is
also
an
area
where
the
winters
are
harsh.
as
a
result
of
the
winds
and
ice,
the
tall
antennas
on
poles
presented
problems
with
the
householders.
as
a
result,
many
clarksburg
and
fairmont
residents
found
it
convenient
to
subscribe
to
the
petitioner's
service
rather
than
put
up
their
own
antennas.others
joined
in
cooperation
with
their
neighbors
and
put
up
cooperative
antennas.
coops
of
this
kind
still
exist
in
these
communities.
others
subscribed
to
community
antennas
other
than
those
owning
to
petitioner
and
those
systems
still
exist.
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
systems
are
classic
examples
of
catv
put
up
where
the
terrain
and
the
distance
made
reception
difficult
for
the
people
in
the
area.
we
were
performing
this
service
which
mr.
gellar
said
yesterday
the
commission
had
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
and
perhaps,
west
virginia
is
a
classical
area
for
the
community
antenna.
figures
that
were
writ
--
issued
recently
suggest
that
more
than
25%
--
more
than
20%
of
the
homes
in
that
area
depend
on
community
antenna
for
their
television
service.
the
court
has
just
heard
community
antenna
discussed
in
very
general
terms
in
the
southwestern
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
i
state
not
only
what
community
antenna
does,
but
also
what
it
does
not
do
because
there
is
confusion
and
a
number
of
allegations
that
do
not
apply
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
in
order
to
operate,
every
television
set
must
have
an
antenna
and
there
must
be
a
connection
between
the
antenna
and
the
receiving
set.
in
most
cases,
the
antenna
is
built
in
to
the
television
set
itself
and
most
people
in
metropolitan
areas
use
the
built-in
antenna.
others
use
rabbit
ears,
others
put
antennas
on
top
of
their
houses
or
on
poles,
depending
on
their
interest
in
television
service
and
how
much
they
wish
to
spend
for
an
antenna.
but
in
all
instances,
they
must
have
an
antenna
and
the
connection
from
the
antenna
to
the
set
for
the
set
to
operate.
now,
the
sole
activity
of
the
petitioner's
antenna
system
was
to
put
up
an
antenna
and
to
provide
an
antenna
connection
or
a
wire
connection
to
the
set.
we
had
antennas
on
telephone
poles
or
on
structures,
on
hills
near
the
towns,
and
they
were
connected
to
the
towns
by
wire
coaxial
cable
and
distributed
along
the
cables
were
amplifiers
in
order
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal
because
it
losses
its
strength
as
it
passes
through
the
wires.
the
respondent's
expert
testified
that
the
function
of
our
antenna
system
is
the
same
as
that
of
a
home
antenna
or
an
apartment
house
antenna.
petitioner
systems
received
the
entire
broadcast
of
the
stations
and
it
was
able
to
receive
--
there
was
no
editing
or
deletion.
the
service
provided
was
instantaneous
and
simultaneous.
there
was
no
recording
or
transcriptions
made
of
any
broadcasts.
the
petitioner
did
not
originate
any
programs
and
had
no
equipment
to
do
so.
i
wish
to
characterize
the
service
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
what
we
did.
we
provided
a
service
for
a
flat
fee.
we
charged
just
a
flat
fee
regardless
of
whether
any
programs
were
watched
by
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there's
a
connection
by
coaxial
cables
strung
along
telephone
poles
on
the
streets,
sir.
and
from
that
coaxial
cable,
there's
what
is
called
a
drop,
a
connecting
cable
that
goes
into
the
house
itself.
it
goes
into
the
house
and
the
subscriber
attaches
it
to
his
own
television
set
within
his
house.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
point
right
now,
sir.
we
of
the
--
each
system
received
five
stations.
there
are
therefore
ten
station
system
situations,
all
of
them
were
received
off
the
air.
in
five
of
the
instances,
we
are
receiving
what
the
commission
calls
local
stations.
that
is
the
system
was
within
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
station
itself.
and
the
other
five
instances,
we
were
virtually
on
or
very
near
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
station.
we
were
within
an
area
where
reception
is
possible
off
the
air.
this
is
all
off
the
air
reception.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
--
it's
conceivable
it
would
have
been
inferior.
they
would
obviously
have
made
other
arrangements
for
their
television
reception.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
steubenville
and
wheeling.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they're
all
the
same
here,
sir.
there
were
two
separate
systems,
one
in
clarksburg
and
one
in
fairmont
and
received
the
same
stations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
the
fairmont
case,
in
four
instances,
it
was
within
the
b
and
in
one
instance,
it
was
just
outside,
and
clarksburg
it
is
the
reverse.
it
was
one
instance
within
the
b
and
four
instances
just
outside.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
partly
by
the
hilliness
and
it's
with
--
it's
certainly
within
the
area
where
reception
would
have
been
expected
if
it
were
not
for
the
ruggedness
of
the
area.
may
i
say
that
there
is
no
sight
or
sound
involved
in
any
part
of
our
system.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
sight
or
sound.
if
there
is
any
rendition
of
the
movies
involved
here,
it's
in
the
homes
of
the
subscribers.
they
provide
their
own
sets.
we
do
not
sell
them,
service
them,
provide
them
or
control
them
in
any
way.
we
don't
display
or
show
a
program
of
any
nature
in
the
community
antenna
system.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
is
--
there
are
about
1,800
systems
as
i
understand
it,
1,800
community
antenna
television
systems
throughout
the
nation
and
of
course,
there
are
many
thousand
apartment
house
antennas
which
provide
service
for
the
people
who
live
in
the
apartments
and
use
equipment
substantially
like
that
which
is
used
by
the
community
antenna
systems.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
general,
it's
done
by
small
companies,
sir.
the
industry
is
diffused
and
it's
a
small
town
industry.
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
some
larger
companies
that
have
come
into
the
business,
but
it
is
essentially
a
small
town
business
and
is
a
small
town
type
industry.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
did
business
just
in
these
sections
here.
other
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
that's
correct,
sir.
we
do
not
do
anything
at
all
with
the
programs.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
programs.
we
provide
a
service
which
connects
an
antenna
well
situated
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they
could
certainly
have
filed
over
with
the
antenna
service
because
it
is
available
in
the
community
by
coops
or
other
ways.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir,
it
provides
a
more
efficient
antenna
service
and
the
higher
the
--
the
more
--
the
better
the
location
of
the
antenna,
the
better
your
reception
will
be.
we
provide
that
service
and
provide
a
--
an
efficient
link
between
the
antenna
and
the
home
sets
of
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
amplify
the
signal
as
it
goes
down
the
line,
mr.
justice
white,
because
it
loses
strength
as
it
passes
through
a
cable.
we
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal
with
the
amplifiers,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
equipment
within
our
community
antenna
system
which
converts
from
one
frequency
to
another.
we
convert
from
a
what
so-called
high
band,
that
is
the
7
to
12
down
to
2
to
6
because
it
is
more
efficient
to
transmit
through
the
cables.
you'll
lose
less
on
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it
depends
on
what
you
mean,
mr.
justice
white.
within
each
set,
the
signal
is
converted
by
the
set
itself.
it
is
converted
for
amplification
and
for
purposes
of
circuitry
within
the
set
itself.
so
far
as
conversion
is
concerned,
it's
a
standard
operation
that's
done
by
every
radio
set
and
every
television
set.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
it's
closer
to
2,000,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i'm
sure
that
many
of
them
do
because
the
equipment
is
reasonably
standard,
your
honor.
it
is
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
normally,
they
have
a
cable
which
connects
from
the
antenna
to
the
--
into
town.
they
use
lots
of
names,
they
call
it
runs.
the
equipment
has
been
described
as
being
sophisticated
and
complicated.
it
involves
nothing
that's
complicated
electronically.
i'm
sure
mr.
nizer
will
point
out
that
it
cost
quite
a
bit
of
money
but
then,
it
also
provides
antenna
service
for
quite
a
few
people.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
as
a
signal
is
received,
it
is
amplified
near
the
antenna
site
in
order
to
maintain
strength
down
the
cable
as
the
cable
--
as
it
moves
down
into
town
because
it
loses
strength
as
it
passes
through
the
cable.
so
amplifiers
are
spaced
every
thousand
or
1,500
feet,
whatever
it
is,
in
order
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal.
but
i
would
point
out
one
thing
to
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
that
the
community
antenna
can
do
to
improve
the
signal
as
it's
received
at
the
antenna
site.
if
the
signal
received
at
the
antenna
site
is
bad,
it
remains
bad.
all
it
can
do
is
maintain
the
signal
in
the
form
in
which
it
arrives
at
the
antenna
site
as
efficiently
as
possible.
it
endeavors
with
its
equipment
to
avoid
distortion
between
the
antenna
site
and
the
homes,
but
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
improve
the
signal
if
when
it
arrives
at
the
antenna
as
bad.
in
that
respect,
it's
exactly
like
a
home.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
--
but
you
couldn't
improve
it
if
it
had
snow
or
distortion
that
there's
nothing
you
could
do
about
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
you
could
strengthen.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor,
just
as
every
television
set
does,
too.
there
are
several
additional
undisputed
facts
that
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
every
one
of
these
broadcasts
that
were
involved
here
were
licensed.
there's
no
contention
that
the
broadcasts
are
infringed.
we
received
all
of
the
signals
off
the
air
and
the
--
what
we
conduct
or
transmit
is
electromagnetic
energy
and
the
respondent
claims
no
copyright
in
the
electromagnetic
energy.
the
only
rendition,
if
there
is
any,
is
in
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
and
there
is
no
contention
that
that
viewing
is
an
infringement.
a
copyright
is
a
completely
statutory
right
and
whatever
is
claimed
by
the
copyright
owner
must
be
found
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute.
sections
1
(c)
and
1
(d)
confirm
on
the
copyright
owner
the
exclusive
right
to
perform
the
copyrighted
work.
but
in
order
to
be
an
infringement
however,
there
must
be
two
separate
elements
shown
as
required
by
the
statute.
first,
there
must
be
a
performance
of
the
copyrighted
work,
and
second,
the
performance
must
be
in
public.
in
the
case
of
1
(c),
there
is
a
third
element
for
profit.
i
emphasize
these
separate
elements
because
the
respondent
has
endeavored
to
collapse
them
into
one
in
public.
there
must
first
be
a
performance
and
then
in
public.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
in
public
or
private
if
it's
not
a
performance.
the
number
of
the
subscribers
which
we
have
may
be
relevant
to
the
issue
whether
it's
in
public
but
that
issue
is
reached
only
if
it's
first
found
that
there
is
a
performance.
so
i
then
turn
to
the
question
which
i
regard
as
the
key
question,
whether
we
perform
the
copyrighted
work,
that
is
whether
receiving
the
signal
off
the
air,
conducting
it
through
a
wire
with
amplifiers
and
with
the
equipment
that
we
use
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
without
sight
or
sound
is
a
performance
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
guiding
principles
for
the
construction
of
the
copyright
act
were
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
white
smith
against
the
apollo
company
case
many
years
ago.
there,
the
issue
was
whether
a
perforated
role,
piano
player
role
was
a
copy
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act.
it
was
no
doubt
that
you
could
use
the
role
to
reproduce
the
music
and
they
were
the
economic
arguments
made
there
which
are
like
those
made
here.
however,
the
court
held
there
that
this
was
not
a
copy
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
laid
down
the
construction
of
the
copyright
statute.
it
said
that
you
should
not
use
strained
and
artificial
meaning
in
construing
the
words
but
the
words
should
be
construed
as
the
court
said
using
its
words
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
sense,
the
common
understanding
or
the
generally
understood
meanings
of
the
terms.
and
it's
this
construction
which
we
think
if
applicable
here
indicates
that
what
we
do
is
not
to
perform
the
copyrighted
work.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
what
would
be
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”.
the
district
court
did
consider
it
but
recognized
that
the
meaning
it
was
adopting
was
not
that
which
an
ordinary
layman
would
use
for
the
word
perform.
we
believe
that
if
the
courts
below
had
followed
the
standard
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words,
they
would
have
recognized
that
the
word
“perform”
in
the
copyright
statute
means
providing
a
visible
and
audible
rendition
of
the
work,
a
rendition
of
the
work.
we
think
this
is
the
meaning
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
statute.
it
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
problem
of
stage
plays
and
people
who
came
in
and
took
stenographic
notes
or
transcriptions
of
the
play
with
the
intention
of
giving
an
authorized
performance
at
a
later
date.
congress
is
also
concerned
with
the
nickelodeon
what
it
called
the
graphic
phone
and
the
phonograph
and
the
player
piano.
indeed
in
section
1
(e)
which
is
not
involved
here,
the
so-called
jukebox
provision,
in
order
to
provide
and
exception
from
the
public
performance
provision
for
a
jukebox,
the
congress
had
to
say
that
a
rendition
or
a
reproduction
of
the
music
was
not
a
public
performance
except
where
admission
were
charged.
this
is
in
my
--
our
minds
a
clear
indication
of
the
relationship
between
rendition
sight
and
sound
and
performance.
we
believe
that
to
hold
that
by
receiving
a
broadcast
signal
and
conducting
those
signals
with
whatever
equipment
is
needed
to
maintain
their
strength
to
the
homes
of
their
subscribers.
without
sight
or
sound
is
not
a
performance
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
and
does
not
meet
the
standards
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
white
smith
case.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they're
doing
several
things.
a
broadcaster
is
in
a
very
different
kind
of
business
than
we're
in.
a
broadcaster's
business
is
to
procure
programming.
as
federal
communication
has
said,
his
--
the
essence
of
his
business
is
to
procure
programs.
he
can
either
procure
programs
by
having
a
program
in
his
own
studio
or
he
can
procure
the
program
by
having
it
performed
in
a
distant
studio.
and
his
job
is
to,
once
he
procured
the
program,
is
to
make
the
program
public
by
means
of
a
broadcast.
the
fact
that
he
gets
it
from
a
network
simply
means
that
his
studio
is
placed
at
some
distance
from
where
he
is.
it's
not
in
the
building
where
he's
actually
conducting
his
business.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
network
doesn't
originate,
your
honor.
the
network
does
not
broadcast.
the
network
provides
programs
to
stations
to
broadcast.
the
network
is
not
engaged
in
broadcasting.
it
is
simply
engaged
in
providing
programs.
it
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
stations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
stations
pay
or
in
the
instance
of
the
network,
the
network
provides
the
clearance
in
advance
for
the
stations,
but
it
is
not
the
network
which
is
the
broadcaster.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor
because
the
station
which
is,
as
you
say,
retransmitting
is
also
engaged
in
broadcasting.
and
the
fact
that
he
has
got
his
program
from
a
distant
studio
doesn't
make
any
difference
than
when
he
got
his
program
in
his
own
studio.he
is
procuring
a
program
for
the
purposes
of
broadcast.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
there
are.
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
the
physical
activities,
your
honor.
in
order
to
broadcast
the
station
which,
as
you
said,
retransmitted,
must
modulate
a
carrier
wave
in
order
to
broadcast
because
what
he
receives
is
a
video
or
sound
signal.
our
equipment
does
not
modulate
a
carrier
wave.
indeed,
one
of
the
misconceptions
of
the
district
court
was
that
we
are
the
same
as
the
broadcaster
because
we
modulate
a
carrier
wave.
the
truth
is
that
once
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
but
he
is
procuring
a
performance
in
another
location.
the
difference
between
the
location
within
his
building
and
the
location
outside
his
building
seems
to
me
to
be
not
very
significant,
but
what
he's
doing
is
asking
that
a
performance
be
made
someplace
else
and
doing
it
under
contract,
i.e.,
by
a
network
agreement.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
because
we're
making
no
arrangements
for
our
programs.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
him.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
be
in
advance.
we
don't
know
where
they
come
from,
and
we
don't
ex
--
we
don't
endeavor
to
exploit
them
as
programs.
we
sell
no
advertising.
we
do
nothing
with
them,
which
is
what
a
broadcaster
does
with
them.
this
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
to
sell
advertising
and
association
with
them.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
critical
issue
is
what
is
the
public
entitled
to
receive
off
the
air.
if
the
receiver
is
within
the
normal
service
area
of
a
station
where
the
signal
can
be
received
off
the
air,
in
our
view,
it
is
the
public's
right
to
receive,
which
should
be
given
--
paid
attention
to
here,
and
when
we
argue
the
second
branch
of
the
case,
i
will
argue
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
within
the
antenna
it
chooses,
that
this
is
the
nature
of
broadcasting
and
the
right
which
was
conferred.
and
indeed,
we
--
our
contention
is
that
the
copyright
owner
had
been
paid.
he
is
releasing
a
particular
form
of
his
work
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
a
broadcast.
he
is
releasing
it
because
he
licensed
the
broadcaster
and
he's
paid
for
that
broadcast,
and
the
people
who
receive
the
broadcast
off
the
air
are
the
people
for
whom
the
broadcast
was
intended
indeed
as
a
matter
of
law.
under
the
communications
act,
the
broadcast
must
be
that
which
is
intended
to
be
received
by
the
public.
and
in
our
view,
the
public
interest
is
what
is
paramount
here
as
to
the
right
to
receive
once
you
have
licensed
the
broadcast
itself.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
certainly
could
not
transcribe
it
or
record
it.
you
could
not
rebroadcast
it
because
section
325
forbids
rebroadcasting
and
we
are
not
a
broadcaster.
we
are
engaged
solely
and
exclusively
in
simultaneous
and
instantaneous
reception
off
the
air
of
a
television
signal.
our
--
the
courts
below
rely
on
buck
against
jewell-lasalle,
the
hotel
case,
and
we
think
erroneously
because
that
case
confirms
our
view
that
the
court
has
adhered
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
perform.
in
that
case,
the
hotels
was
held
to
have
performed
the
music
but
its
equipment
was
significantly
different
from
that
which
the
community
antenna
has.
the
hotel
not
only
had
an
antenna
and
a
connection
between
the
antenna
of
a
radio
set,
it
had
loudspeakers.
and
it
was
the
fact
that
it
provided
the
music
in
audible
form
in
the
loudspeakers
which
the
court
referred
to
in
connection
to
performance.
mr.
nizer
would
interpret
it
to
mean
that
if
the
hotel
simply
had
a
wire
down
to
a
radio
set
but
no
loudspeakers
so
that
you
heard
nothing
that
the
hotel
would
have
held
to
have
performed.
we
think
that
the
--
if
you
see
the
--
in
the
opinion,
the
significance
of
the
hearing
of
the
music
is
paramount
to
the
decision
in
that
case
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
because
the
court
said
it
was
the
translation
in
the
sound
of
the
musical
works
on
instrumentalities
under
the
hotel's
control,
which
was
the
reproduction
that
amounted
to
a
performance.
here,
there
was
no
translation
of
the
sound,
no
visible
nor
audible
reproduction
of
the
music,
and
we
think
therefore
that
the
hotel
case
actually
demonstrates
that
the
word
“perform”
does
not
apply
to
the
operations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
is
only
one
instance
--
well,
your
honor,
that
case
has
come
up
in
canada
where
they
--
the
system
provided
something
called
radio
diffusion.
it
provided
all
of
the
hotel
--
provided
all
of
the
equipment
in
the
homes.
the
canadian
court
said
that
the
performance
in
the
homes
or
the
rendition
in
the
homes
was
a
private
performance
and
that
when
the
radio
diffusion
system
had
sets
in
a
public
room,
that
part
of
its
operations
was
a
public
performance.
our
respondent
tried
its
case
on
the
theory
that
performance
could
be
found
in
the
electronic
function
of
our
equipment
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
view.
there
were
two
technological
alternates
which
were
urged
and
which
the
respondent
no
longer
urges
here.
first,
it
said
that
because
of
the
way
the
circuitry
has
worked
inside
the
television
--
inside
of
the
equipment,
there
was
an
electronic
reproduction
made
that
is
the
of
the
signal,
that
is
the
signal
that
came
out
of
the
tube,
had
the
same
electrical
characteristics,
and
that
this
was
a
reproduction
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act.
no
one
supports
this
view
here
and
the
almost
unbelievable
billions
of
numbers
of
tubes
that
would
be
involved
if
that
weren't
correct
is
an
indication
of
the
tremendous
sweep
of
this
position.
the
second
position
which
they
took
below
was
that
because
our
equipment
modulated
the
carrier
wave
that
its
electronic
function
was
like
a
broadcaster.
hence,
we
performed.
i
have
commented
on
this.
we
had
equipment
at
one
time
which
model
--
modulated
the
video
carrier
but
not
the
sound
carrier.
our
older
equipment
did
not.
the
more
modern
equipment
modulates
nothing,
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
since
modulation
is
neither
required
nor
typical
as
catv
equipment,
this
theory
of
performance
must
fall.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
may
i
suggest
your
honor
that
this
mixes
up
the
electromagnetic
energy
which
we
receive
and
the
copyrighted
work.
there
is
no
contention
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
they
get
mixed
up
in
the
argument
but
they
don't
get
mixed
up
in
fact
because
there's
no
doubt
that
the
copyright
is
not
on
the
electromagnetic
energy.
if
there
is
a
copyright,
it
is
on
the
movie
and
on
the
performance
of
the
movie.
and
so
far
as
the
electromagnetic
energy
is
concerned
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
when
you
go
to
the
movies?
you
see
light
or
a
picture.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
that
everything
could
be
reduced
to
electromagnetic
energy
because
i
guess
that's
all
we
are.
but
i
--
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
don't
feel
very
electromagnetic
but
it
does
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
it
does
confuse
what
the
statute
is
talking
about,
the
copyrighted
work
and
electromagnetic
energy
because
all
we
deal
with
or
conduct
or
amplify
or
convert
is
electromagnetic
energy,
and
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
a
copyright
on
that.
indeed,
it
could
not
be
copyrighted.
if
there
is
something
that
is
a
rendition
and
you
must
look
to
the
statute
as
to
what
it
covers.
if
there
is
a
performance,
in
our
view,
it
is
in
the
home
where
the
light
and
sound
appear.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
within
the
theory
which
was
just
suggested
here,
yes,
they
would
be
liable
and
one
of
the
points
which
we
have
made
is
that
the
various
theories
of
performance
urged
in
this
court
sweep
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
statute
not
only
community
antennas
but
the
apartment
house
antenna
which
is
so
common
in
this
area.
they
sweep
within
their
scope
the
common
carriers.
they
sweep
within
their
scope
new
methods
of
communication
which
are
just
on
the
horizon
because
they
include
within
their
scope
these
broad
elements
of
communication
or
the
dealing
in
electromagnetic
energy.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
that
case
--
that
point
came
up
specifically
in
the
record
and
it
is
no
doubt
that
the
function
of
the
apartment
house
antenna
is
exactly
the
same
as
ours,
respondent's
expert
so
testified,
and
the
equip
--
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
equipment
was
the
same.
we
were
not
permitted
to
make
that
--
good
on
that
offer,
but
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
equipment
was
the
same.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
that
that
was
conceded
but
no
effort
had
been
made
to
collect
from
anyone
prior
to
the
time
they
brought
suit
against
us.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
that's
correct,
sir.
i'm
talking
of
community
antennas
or
apartment
house
antennas.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
community
antennas
or
apartment
house
antennas.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
--
well,
there
are
two
varying
in
charges
depending
on
whether
they
paid
a
so-called
installation
fee
or
a
rental
fee.
it's
$3.75
if
they
paid
an
installation
fee
and
$5.00
if
they
paid
a
rental
fee.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
a
month.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
the
total
charge,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
indeed,
under
the
argument
which
is
here
in
this
court
now,
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
the
viewing
in
the
homes
is
not
even
relevant
to
the
question
whether
or
not
we
infringe
or
whether
or
not
we
perform
to
be
more
specific.
they
say
that
the
viewing
is,
as
they
said
in
the
opposition,
private
performance
and
in
their
brief
here,
they
say
it's
not
even
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly,
therefore
you
must
find
that
performance
in
the
wires
and
amplifiers
and
what
we
do
to
the
electromagnetic
energy
within
the
wires
and
amplifiers
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
there
are
no
such
fcc
rules,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
sir.
what
they
mean
is
that
you
block
out,
it
isn't
that
you
tape.
it
means
that
you
block
out.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
if
they
do,
it's
not
in
this
case
and
i
know
of
no
one
in
this
practice
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
statute
reads
specifically
on
the
making
of
a
transcription
or
a
record
of
a
copyrighted
at
work.
but
that
is
--
that's
illegal
because
the
statute
forbids
the
making.
it
isn't
because
it's
a
public
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
don't
know
--
there
are
great
many
apartment
house
antennas
in
washington
and
baltimore.
there
are
some
that
i
understand
are
constructed
close
here.
cumberland,
maryland
has
a
catv.
there
are
some
out
by
the
bay
that
the
communities
are
setting
up
catvs
and
i
think
there
are
some
around
the
metropolitan
area.
i
don't
know
of
any
in
the
metropolitan
area,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
in
new
york
city,
this
is
the
way
they
work.
they
--
under
the
franchise
in
new
york
city,
they
pick
up
only
local
cities.
new
york
from
the
point
of
view
of
electromagnetic
wave
is
a
horrid
area
because
it's
very
mountainous.
and
so,
reception
is
difficult
in
the
apartment
buildings
in
new
york,
so
that
they
do
use
antenna
systems
there
for
reception
and
to
improve
the
reception.
this
is
the
kind
of
function
which
we
contend
we're
doing
in
the
area
worthy
because
of
terrain
or
other
reasons
the
reception
is
difficult.
we
are
providing
a
service
that
makes
the
reception
better.
the
respondent
really
has
three
theories
of
performance
which
is
surging
in
this
court.
the
first
is
that
by
amplifying,
processing
and
retransmitting
electromagnetic
energy
we
are
performing,
every
television
set,
every
radio
set,
every
communications
common
carrier
does
that.
the
second
is
that
we
are
communicating
the
pictures
in
whatever
form
they
may
be
to
where
they
become
visible
or
audible.
this
is
the
separate
new
position
which
they
took
in
this
--
in
their
brief
in
the
court
this
time.
as
i
tried
to
comment
earlier,
i
think
this
confuses
the
signal
with
the
copyrighted
work.
the
rendition
of
the
work
which
they
say
is
irrelevant
to
performance
occurs
in
the
home
and
we
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
a
performance
without
a
rendition.
in
the
buck
case,
there
surely
would
not
have
been
a
performance
found
if
the
hotel
did
not
have
loudspeakers
on
which
it
made
the
music
audible
for
the
benefit
of
its
guests.
respondent
relies
on
three
broadcaster
cases
for
its
argument.
each
of
these
cases
involved
the
actual
performance
of
the
music
in
the
studio
of
the
broadcaster,
one
was
in
american
case,
the
remick
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
one
was
an
australian
case
and
one
was
a
british
case.
in
each
case,
there
was
--
there's
no
question
that
there
was
an
actually
rendition
of
the
work
in
the
studio.
the
issue
which
the
court
addressed
itself
to
is
whether
that
performance
had
been
made
public
by
the
broadcaster.
in
each
instance,
they
said
it
was
made
public.
the
broadcaster's
function
as
i
have
tried
to
say
is
significantly
different
both
from
a
physical
and
business
point
of
view
than
the
catv.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
this
problem
has
ramifications
in
copyright
law,
communications
regulations
and
anti-trust,
and
we
suggest
that
in
an
area
where
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
congressional
intent,
here
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
congressional
intent.
these
are
considerations
which
the
court
should
have
in
mind
in
construing
or
deciding
whether
to
extend
or
expand
the
monopoly
conferred
by
the
copyright
statute.
in
earlier
testimony
and
in
its
memorandum,
the
department
of
justice
points
out
the
anti-competitive
consequences
that
would
flow
if
infringement
were
imposed
on
catv.
as
i
said
earlier,
this
is
a
small
town
industry.
and
as
the
solicitor
has
said,
copyrights
are
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
networks
and
seven
movie
companies,
either
because
of
back
damages,
and
respondent
is
claiming
$250.00
minimum
damage
for
every
cartoon
and
every
movie
which
we
received.
on
the
basis
of
that
claim,
we
would
be
incurring
damages
at
the
rate
of
$1
million
a
month.
obviously,
this
opens
the
way
to
take
over
the
community
antenna
business.
but
even
apart
from
the
past
damages,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
copyright
infringement
is
imposed,
they
will
be
able
to
control
the
community
antennas
for
the
purposes
of
--
for
their
own
purposes
obviously.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
putting
a
community
antenna
on
a
business
by
the
size
of
the
fee
they
would
charge.
and
indeed,
they
have
said
that
we
were
carrying
programs
into
areas
that
they
would
otherwise
like
to
exploit
differently.
so
clearly,
they
want
to
cut
off
the
reception
of
the
programs
in
those
areas.
so
far
as
the
copyright
owner
is
concerned,
he
has
received
his
reward.
he's
been
paid
for
the
broadcast
as
i
had
said
earlier.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
this
and
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
copyright
owner
had
been
paid
not
only
for
the
audience
of
the
station
but
the
audience
which
included
the
catv
subscribers.
what
the
broadcasters
and
the
na
-
national
association
of
broadcasters'
brief
and
it
makes
clear
the
respondent
says
here
they
want
to
control
the
competition
between
stations
for
their
own
purposes.
they
want
to
cut
off
by
license
agreements
the
reception
of
the
signals
of
a
competing
station
when
it
suits
their
interest.
they
want
to
supplant
the
regulation
of
reception
by
license
exclusivity,
license
agreements
to
supplant
the
regulation
which
the
fcc
as
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest
has
been
explained
to
you
in
the
case
just
preceding.
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
the
same
power
in
the
use
of
exclusive
territories
which
concerned
the
court
in
the
schwene
case
and
the
albreck
case.
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
not
strain
to
expand
the
statute
in
order
to
encourage
this
kind
of
exclusivity.
this
brings
me
to
the
second
issue,
the
issue
of
the
license
implied
in
law.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
license
implied
in
law
to
receive
broadcasts
off
the
air.
if
it
be
assumed
that
our
systems
perform
the
copyrighted
works,
which
we
deny,
then
the
question
is,
does
the
public
have
a
license
implied
in
law
to
receive
the
broadcast
off
the
air
with
whatever
set
or
equipment
it
chooses,
including
a
community
antenna?
this
was
a
question
reserved
in
the
jewell-lasalle
case
and
as
the
court
below
said,
it's
presented
here
as
a
question
of
first
impression.
in
our
view,
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
broadcasts
off
the
air
with
antennas
of
their
choice.
and
that
this
policy
--
this
is
based
on
the
policy
embodied
on
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act.
when
a
copyright
owner
has
licensed
a
broadcast,
he
has
received
his
reward
for
releasing
that
particular
embodiment
of
his
work
to
the
public.
i
emphasize
this,
your
honor,
because
there
has
been
confusion.
it's
been
said
that
we
are
--
say
the
work
is
dedicated
to
the
public.
that's
not
correct.
we
said
that
--
it's
been
said
that
we
are
charging
that
the
owner
loses
his
right
to
license
other
broadcast
stations.
it
said
that
work
falls
in
the
public
domain.
the
only
point
we
have
made
is
that
when
the
broadcast
--
when
the
copyright
owner
decides
to
license
a
broadcast,
the
public
has
a
right
to
receive
that
broadcast
off
the
air
with
its
antenna
of
its
choice,
including
catv,
and
that
the
copyright
owner
cannot
control
that
reception
or
put
a
second
charge
on
it.
respondent
says
there
is
no
such
license
implied
in
law.
it
says
it
doesn't
want
to
charge
the
public
and
wants
to
charge
the
community
antenna.
this
is
of
course
just
passing
beside
the
point
because
clearly,
a
charge
on
the
community
antenna
is
a
charge
on
the
public.
it's
a
charge
in
doing
business
and
will
be
passed
along.
and
certainly,
in
the
case
of
apartment
house
antennas,
it
would
be
a
charge
directly
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
our
position,
that
this
is
genuinely
a
charge
to
the
public.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
it's
conceded
that
this
non-infringing,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
they
claim
that
the
principle
is
do-it-yourself,
that
you
must
put
up
your
own
antenna,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
go
to
others
to
assist
you
in
reception
of
your
program
a
reception
of
the
broadcast.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
on
the
--
you're
getting
exactly
the
same
performance
on
a
private
antenna
as
you're
getting
on
the
community
antenna.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
if
i
underst
--
in
my
view,
yes.
but
if
i
understand
respondent's
position
correctly,
no,
their
view
is
that
the
viewing
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly.
they
have
also
stated
that
the
viewing
in
the
homes
is
a
private
performance,
not
a
public
performance.
now,
which
position
they're
taking
right
now,
i
don't
know.
the
respondent's
primary
legal
argument
is
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
do-it-yourself.
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
thing
as
a
homeowner
can
do
if
he
chooses
to
do
it.
what
they're
suggesting
is
that
an
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
it
quite
possibly
may,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
under
--
i
think
that
under
the
construction
of
the
rule
below
and
certainly
under
the
respondent's
theories
here,
the
gentleman
is
maybe
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly
because
he
was
contributing,
he
was
providing
--
making
it
possible
for
you
to
view
what
otherwise
you
wouldn't
view.
as
i
was
saying,
the
main
legal
argument
that's
made
here
is
that
a
broadcast
is
different
from
a
sale
of
a
book
and
because
of
a
license
to
a
broadcaster
is
personal
while
a
sale
of
a
book
is
a
transfer
of
title
in
a
channel.
but
the
form
of
the
release
we
suggest
--
the
form
of
the
release
to
the
public
selected
by
the
monopolist,
the
copyright
owner
we
believe
is
not
important
in
this
context.
the
normal
method
for
release
of
a
book
is
sale.
the
normal
method
for
release
to
the
public
of
a
film
to
be
broadcast
is
by
broadcast.
the
controlling
issue
is
not
the
form
which
the
copyright
owner
chooses
to
release
to
the
public
but
the
pubic
policy
underlying
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
that
once
the
copyright
owner
has
been
paid,
and
he
has
been
paid
here,
then
the
public
policy
of
release
to
the
public
should
be
the
guiding
policy
and
the
public
should
be
entitled
to
receive
that
broadcast
by
any
means
it
finds
convenient,
including
a
do-it-yourself
or
a
community
antenna
if
it
chooses
to.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
the
first
one?
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
theatre
was
performing
within
the
meaning
buck
case.
this
is
providing
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
conceivable
that
we
would
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringement
but
we
would
not
be
liable
as
a
performer
because
we
are
not
giving
a
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
might
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringement
and
need
the
respond
that
has
said
that
it's
going
to
make
such
a
contention
but
so
far
as
we
can
see,
the
performance
is
done
by
the
theatre
in
your
illustration
and
not
by
us.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor.
i
find
a
little
hard
to
recognize
the
case.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
involving
the
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
as
it
appears
in
the
copyright
act.
mr.
nizer
refers
to
criminal
prosecution
in
1954
involving
a
man
who
cut
the
cable.
he
talks
about
station
wboy,
this
is
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
footnote
25
and
i
commend
the
court
to
that.
the
only
theory
on
which
he
tried
to
bring
this
within
the
statute
is
that
there
has
been
a
reception
or
a
transmission
as
he
says
for
profit.
the
statute
doesn't
read
on
reception
or
transmission.
the
statute
reads
on
perform
and
there
is
no
element
of
profit
in
section
1
(d)
but
there
is
in
1
(c).
the
statutes
briefs
on
perform
and
in
public.
mr.
nizer
says
that
he
does
not
wish
to
cover
master
antennas
but
there
is
no
way
in
which
you
can
exclude
master
antennas
if
reception
and
transmission
are
to
test.
that's
exactly
what
they
do.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
a
man
pays
for
his
master
antenna
service
and
his
rent
rather
than
pays
directly
for
the
service.
mr.
nizer
talked
about
advertising.
is
it
--
does
it
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
a
man
advertises
or
not
as
to
whether
he
performs
is
--
performing
when
it
says
something
in
its
ad
about
ads
for
television
sets.
you
can
see
the
world
series
game,
is
that
performing
the
world
series
game?
i
don't
understand
this.
i
don't
understand
the
relevance
of
this
at
all.
we
must
somehow
rather
get
back
to
the
statute
and
look
to
see
what
these
systems
do
and
how
it
fits
the
statutes.
mr.
nizer
talked
about
the
expensive
equipment.
we
hope
our
equipments
could.we
tried
to
buy
good
equipment
and
we
hope
we
provide
a
decent
service
to
our
people
and
we'll
certainly
try
to
do
better
for
our
subscribers
if
we
can.
he
talks
about
broadcasting.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
congressional
intent
as
to
the
community
antenna
but
the
evidence
of
congressional
intent
as
to
broadcasting
is
clear.
in
1952,
the
congress
amended
section
1
(c)
specifically
with
reference
to
broadcasting
thus
making
a
claim
that
the
congress
thought
that
broadcasting
was
covered
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
he
speaks
about
unfair
competition.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
commission
addresses
itself
to
what
it
regards
as
a
competitive
problem
and
its
rules
and
regulations
deal
with
that.
he
talks
about
the
local
station.
well,
there
is
no
doubt
that
reception
of
the
local
station
on
the
community
antenna
would
in
mr.
nizer's
views
being
infringement.
he
is
not
trying
to
provide
an
audience
for
the
local
station.
he
wants
to
prohibit
reception
in
order
that
he
can
practice
exclusivity
in
his
marketing.
he
talks
about
the
federal
communications
commission
being
concerned
with
this
matter
because
copyright
infringement
has
not
been
imposed
on
a
community
antenna.
this
is
just
plain
not
correct
as
mr.
gellar
said
today,
the
commission
has
found
the
community
antenna
provides
a
valuable
service
in
connection
with
the
reception
in
the
service
areas
of
the
stations.
this
is
precisely
what
it
does
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
do.
he
suggests
that
we
are
proposing
that
the
copyright
act
has
been
repealed
by
the
communications
act.
it's
not
correct
at
all.
our
position
is
that
the
public
policy
underlying
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
should
be
considered
by
the
court
when
it
is
deciding
whether
or
not
to
extend
the
meaning
of
a
word
performs
in
a
noble
area,
an
area
not
contemplated
by
the
congress.
he
said
we
select
the
programs.
it's
completely
agreed
that
there
has
been
no
selection
of
programs
here
in
the
sense
that
we
did
not
receive
everything
that
is
on
the
air.
there
is
no
deletion,
no
picking
and
choosing.
we
select
the
programs
in
the
sense
that
our
systems
were
capable
of
receiving
five
stations
and
we
receive
five,
we
didn't
receive
six.
in
that
sense,
we
select
it
but
only
in
that
sense.
there
was
no
picking
and
choosing
of
programs.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
have
we
ever
picked
in
a
specific
program
and
receive
for
our
subscribers,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
you
could
take
a
switch
and
turn
it
off
and
on,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
only
by
cutting
off
the
reception
of
one
of
the
three.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
technically,
you
could
switch
from
one
station
to
another.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
there's
been
no
deletion
of
broadcast.
we
have
received
the
entire
broadcast.we
received
it
simultaneously
with
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir,
subject
going
to
shutdown
for
failure
of
equipment.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
five
different
stations,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
sir.
and
he
turns
it
off
or
on
as
he
sees
fit.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
at
or
were
not
to
listen
to
any
which
i'm
sure
many
of
them
elect.
we
suggest
also
your
honor
that
the
issue.
there's
no
question
about
the
rightness
of
the
issue
here.
the
question
is
under
the
statute,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
issue
is
here.
the
issue
implied
in
law
is
that
which
was
reserved
in
the
buck
case.
in
the
buck
case,
the
broadcast
was
unauthorized
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
agree
sir.
in
our
view,
the
construction
of
the
statute
should
take
into
account
as
the
solicitor
suggests
the
harmonizing
of
the
copyright
laws,
communications
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that
if
one
looks
at
the
consequences
in
this
situation,
the
obvious
conclusion
is
that
the
statute
should
not
be
extended
into
a
new
area,
a
noble
area
and
not
contemplated
by
the
congress
that
this
is
a
subject
which
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
congress
and
should
not
be
handled
by
judicial
construction
where
the
consequences
are
those
which
the
solicitor
general
has
foreseen
and
it
is
our
view
therefore
that
we
are
not
proposing
a
violation
that
a
repeal
where
proposing
is
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
right
begins
to
power
which
we
think
is
the
guiding
rule
here.
the
ordinary
common
sense
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
and
under
that
standard,
we
do
not
perform
we're
providing
a
reception
service.
if
there
are
no
questions
your
honor,
i've
concluded.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent,
plaintiff
below
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
licensing
films
and
cartoons
to
television
stations
to
be
broadcasted
by
those
stations.
the
petitioner
on
two
community
antenna
systems
is
charged
with
copyright
infringement
by
reason
of
the
reception
of
the
broadcasts
of
the
movies
and
cartoons
by
the
stations
licensed
by
the
respondent.
there
are
two
basic
issues
on
this
appeal.
first
is
the
reception
of
a
broadcast
signaled
by
the
petitioner,
catv,
and
the
transmission
or
the
conducting
of
that
signal
by
wire
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
without
sight
or
sound
being
involved
a
performance
in
public
of
the
copyrighted
works
within
the
meaning
of
sections
1
(c)
and
1
(d)
of
the
copyrighter.
the
second
and
related
issue
is
whether
when
a
broadcast
has
been
licensed
by
a
copyright
owner,
as
it
has
been
here.
a
member
of
the
public
has
a
license
implied
in
law
under
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
to
receive
off
the
air
and
enjoy
the
authorized
broadcast
by
the
use
of
a
receiving
antenna
of
his
choice,
including
subscribing
to
the
service
of
a
community
antenna.
petitioner's
two
community
antenna
systems
were
located
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont,
west
virginia,
two
towns
in
--.
just
by
west
virginia
is
hilly,
rugged,
and
mountainous.
in
1952
when
the
systems
began,
the
only
television
stations
in
the
area
were
in
pittsburgh
and
in
johnstown,
pennsylvania.
in
1953,
the
stations
in
wheeling,
west
virginia
and
steubenville,
ohio
began
broadcasting.
they
were
--
these
were
the
only
stations
that
the
people
in
this
area
had
from
which
they
could
get
any
television
service.
these
stations
were
some
distance
away
from
clarksburg
and
fairmont.
they're
some
50
to
65
miles
from
fairmont
and
a
little
bit
farther
from
clarksburg.
as
i
said,
the
area
here
is
mountainous
and
the
towns
are
in
hilly
areas.
most
of
the
houses
are
in
valleys
but
there
are
also
houses
and
people
who
live
on
the
hills
and
in
and
around
the
towns.
this
is
also
an
area
where
the
winters
are
harsh.
as
a
result
of
the
winds
and
ice,
the
tall
antennas
on
poles
presented
problems
with
the
householders.
as
a
result,
many
clarksburg
and
fairmont
residents
found
it
convenient
to
subscribe
to
the
petitioner's
service
rather
than
put
up
their
own
antennas.others
joined
in
cooperation
with
their
neighbors
and
put
up
cooperative
antennas.
coops
of
this
kind
still
exist
in
these
communities.
others
subscribed
to
community
antennas
other
than
those
owning
to
petitioner
and
those
systems
still
exist.
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
systems
are
classic
examples
of
catv
put
up
where
the
terrain
and
the
distance
made
reception
difficult
for
the
people
in
the
area.
we
were
performing
this
service
which
mr.
gellar
said
yesterday
the
commission
had
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
and
perhaps,
west
virginia
is
a
classical
area
for
the
community
antenna.
figures
that
were
writ
--
issued
recently
suggest
that
more
than
25%
--
more
than
20%
of
the
homes
in
that
area
depend
on
community
antenna
for
their
television
service.
the
court
has
just
heard
community
antenna
discussed
in
very
general
terms
in
the
southwestern
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
i
state
not
only
what
community
antenna
does,
but
also
what
it
does
not
do
because
there
is
confusion
and
a
number
of
allegations
that
do
not
apply
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
in
order
to
operate,
every
television
set
must
have
an
antenna
and
there
must
be
a
connection
between
the
antenna
and
the
receiving
set.
in
most
cases,
the
antenna
is
built
in
to
the
television
set
itself
and
most
people
in
metropolitan
areas
use
the
built-in
antenna.
others
use
rabbit
ears,
others
put
antennas
on
top
of
their
houses
or
on
poles,
depending
on
their
interest
in
television
service
and
how
much
they
wish
to
spend
for
an
antenna.
but
in
all
instances,
they
must
have
an
antenna
and
the
connection
from
the
antenna
to
the
set
for
the
set
to
operate.
now,
the
sole
activity
of
the
petitioner's
antenna
system
was
to
put
up
an
antenna
and
to
provide
an
antenna
connection
or
a
wire
connection
to
the
set.
we
had
antennas
on
telephone
poles
or
on
structures,
on
hills
near
the
towns,
and
they
were
connected
to
the
towns
by
wire
coaxial
cable
and
distributed
along
the
cables
were
amplifiers
in
order
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal
because
it
losses
its
strength
as
it
passes
through
the
wires.
the
respondent's
expert
testified
that
the
function
of
our
antenna
system
is
the
same
as
that
of
a
home
antenna
or
an
apartment
house
antenna.
petitioner
systems
received
the
entire
broadcast
of
the
stations
and
it
was
able
to
receive
--
there
was
no
editing
or
deletion.
the
service
provided
was
instantaneous
and
simultaneous.
there
was
no
recording
or
transcriptions
made
of
any
broadcasts.
the
petitioner
did
not
originate
any
programs
and
had
no
equipment
to
do
so.
i
wish
to
characterize
the
service
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
what
we
did.
we
provided
a
service
for
a
flat
fee.
we
charged
just
a
flat
fee
regardless
of
whether
any
programs
were
watched
by
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there's
a
connection
by
coaxial
cables
strung
along
telephone
poles
on
the
streets,
sir.
and
from
that
coaxial
cable,
there's
what
is
called
a
drop,
a
connecting
cable
that
goes
into
the
house
itself.
it
goes
into
the
house
and
the
subscriber
attaches
it
to
his
own
television
set
within
his
house.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
point
right
now,
sir.
we
of
the
--
each
system
received
five
stations.
there
are
therefore
ten
station
system
situations,
all
of
them
were
received
off
the
air.
in
five
of
the
instances,
we
are
receiving
what
the
commission
calls
local
stations.
that
is
the
system
was
within
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
station
itself.
and
the
other
five
instances,
we
were
virtually
on
or
very
near
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
station.
we
were
within
an
area
where
reception
is
possible
off
the
air.
this
is
all
off
the
air
reception.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
--
it's
conceivable
it
would
have
been
inferior.
they
would
obviously
have
made
other
arrangements
for
their
television
reception.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
steubenville
and
wheeling.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they're
all
the
same
here,
sir.
there
were
two
separate
systems,
one
in
clarksburg
and
one
in
fairmont
and
received
the
same
stations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
the
fairmont
case,
in
four
instances,
it
was
within
the
b
and
in
one
instance,
it
was
just
outside,
and
clarksburg
it
is
the
reverse.
it
was
one
instance
within
the
b
and
four
instances
just
outside.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
partly
by
the
hilliness
and
it's
with
--
it's
certainly
within
the
area
where
reception
would
have
been
expected
if
it
were
not
for
the
ruggedness
of
the
area.
may
i
say
that
there
is
no
sight
or
sound
involved
in
any
part
of
our
system.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
sight
or
sound.
if
there
is
any
rendition
of
the
movies
involved
here,
it's
in
the
homes
of
the
subscribers.
they
provide
their
own
sets.
we
do
not
sell
them,
service
them,
provide
them
or
control
them
in
any
way.
we
don't
display
or
show
a
program
of
any
nature
in
the
community
antenna
system.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
is
--
there
are
about
1,800
systems
as
i
understand
it,
1,800
community
antenna
television
systems
throughout
the
nation
and
of
course,
there
are
many
thousand
apartment
house
antennas
which
provide
service
for
the
people
who
live
in
the
apartments
and
use
equipment
substantially
like
that
which
is
used
by
the
community
antenna
systems.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
general,
it's
done
by
small
companies,
sir.
the
industry
is
diffused
and
it's
a
small
town
industry.
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
some
larger
companies
that
have
come
into
the
business,
but
it
is
essentially
a
small
town
business
and
is
a
small
town
type
industry.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
did
business
just
in
these
sections
here.
other
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
that's
correct,
sir.
we
do
not
do
anything
at
all
with
the
programs.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
programs.
we
provide
a
service
which
connects
an
antenna
well
situated
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they
could
certainly
have
filed
over
with
the
antenna
service
because
it
is
available
in
the
community
by
coops
or
other
ways.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir,
it
provides
a
more
efficient
antenna
service
and
the
higher
the
--
the
more
--
the
better
the
location
of
the
antenna,
the
better
your
reception
will
be.
we
provide
that
service
and
provide
a
--
an
efficient
link
between
the
antenna
and
the
home
sets
of
the
subscribers.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
amplify
the
signal
as
it
goes
down
the
line,
mr.
justice
white,
because
it
loses
strength
as
it
passes
through
a
cable.
we
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal
with
the
amplifiers,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
equipment
within
our
community
antenna
system
which
converts
from
one
frequency
to
another.
we
convert
from
a
what
so-called
high
band,
that
is
the
7
to
12
down
to
2
to
6
because
it
is
more
efficient
to
transmit
through
the
cables.
you'll
lose
less
on
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it
depends
on
what
you
mean,
mr.
justice
white.
within
each
set,
the
signal
is
converted
by
the
set
itself.
it
is
converted
for
amplification
and
for
purposes
of
circuitry
within
the
set
itself.
so
far
as
conversion
is
concerned,
it's
a
standard
operation
that's
done
by
every
radio
set
and
every
television
set.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
it's
closer
to
2,000,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i'm
sure
that
many
of
them
do
because
the
equipment
is
reasonably
standard,
your
honor.
it
is
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
normally,
they
have
a
cable
which
connects
from
the
antenna
to
the
--
into
town.
they
use
lots
of
names,
they
call
it
runs.
the
equipment
has
been
described
as
being
sophisticated
and
complicated.
it
involves
nothing
that's
complicated
electronically.
i'm
sure
mr.
nizer
will
point
out
that
it
cost
quite
a
bit
of
money
but
then,
it
also
provides
antenna
service
for
quite
a
few
people.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
as
a
signal
is
received,
it
is
amplified
near
the
antenna
site
in
order
to
maintain
strength
down
the
cable
as
the
cable
--
as
it
moves
down
into
town
because
it
loses
strength
as
it
passes
through
the
cable.
so
amplifiers
are
spaced
every
thousand
or
1,500
feet,
whatever
it
is,
in
order
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
signal.
but
i
would
point
out
one
thing
to
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
that
the
community
antenna
can
do
to
improve
the
signal
as
it's
received
at
the
antenna
site.
if
the
signal
received
at
the
antenna
site
is
bad,
it
remains
bad.
all
it
can
do
is
maintain
the
signal
in
the
form
in
which
it
arrives
at
the
antenna
site
as
efficiently
as
possible.
it
endeavors
with
its
equipment
to
avoid
distortion
between
the
antenna
site
and
the
homes,
but
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
improve
the
signal
if
when
it
arrives
at
the
antenna
as
bad.
in
that
respect,
it's
exactly
like
a
home.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
--
but
you
couldn't
improve
it
if
it
had
snow
or
distortion
that
there's
nothing
you
could
do
about
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
you
could
strengthen.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor,
just
as
every
television
set
does,
too.
there
are
several
additional
undisputed
facts
that
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
every
one
of
these
broadcasts
that
were
involved
here
were
licensed.
there's
no
contention
that
the
broadcasts
are
infringed.
we
received
all
of
the
signals
off
the
air
and
the
--
what
we
conduct
or
transmit
is
electromagnetic
energy
and
the
respondent
claims
no
copyright
in
the
electromagnetic
energy.
the
only
rendition,
if
there
is
any,
is
in
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
and
there
is
no
contention
that
that
viewing
is
an
infringement.
a
copyright
is
a
completely
statutory
right
and
whatever
is
claimed
by
the
copyright
owner
must
be
found
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute.
sections
1
(c)
and
1
(d)
confirm
on
the
copyright
owner
the
exclusive
right
to
perform
the
copyrighted
work.
but
in
order
to
be
an
infringement
however,
there
must
be
two
separate
elements
shown
as
required
by
the
statute.
first,
there
must
be
a
performance
of
the
copyrighted
work,
and
second,
the
performance
must
be
in
public.
in
the
case
of
1
(c),
there
is
a
third
element
for
profit.
i
emphasize
these
separate
elements
because
the
respondent
has
endeavored
to
collapse
them
into
one
in
public.
there
must
first
be
a
performance
and
then
in
public.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
in
public
or
private
if
it's
not
a
performance.
the
number
of
the
subscribers
which
we
have
may
be
relevant
to
the
issue
whether
it's
in
public
but
that
issue
is
reached
only
if
it's
first
found
that
there
is
a
performance.
so
i
then
turn
to
the
question
which
i
regard
as
the
key
question,
whether
we
perform
the
copyrighted
work,
that
is
whether
receiving
the
signal
off
the
air,
conducting
it
through
a
wire
with
amplifiers
and
with
the
equipment
that
we
use
to
the
homes
of
the
subscribers
without
sight
or
sound
is
a
performance
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
guiding
principles
for
the
construction
of
the
copyright
act
were
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
white
smith
against
the
apollo
company
case
many
years
ago.
there,
the
issue
was
whether
a
perforated
role,
piano
player
role
was
a
copy
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act.
it
was
no
doubt
that
you
could
use
the
role
to
reproduce
the
music
and
they
were
the
economic
arguments
made
there
which
are
like
those
made
here.
however,
the
court
held
there
that
this
was
not
a
copy
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
laid
down
the
construction
of
the
copyright
statute.
it
said
that
you
should
not
use
strained
and
artificial
meaning
in
construing
the
words
but
the
words
should
be
construed
as
the
court
said
using
its
words
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
sense,
the
common
understanding
or
the
generally
understood
meanings
of
the
terms.
and
it's
this
construction
which
we
think
if
applicable
here
indicates
that
what
we
do
is
not
to
perform
the
copyrighted
work.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
what
would
be
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”.
the
district
court
did
consider
it
but
recognized
that
the
meaning
it
was
adopting
was
not
that
which
an
ordinary
layman
would
use
for
the
word
perform.
we
believe
that
if
the
courts
below
had
followed
the
standard
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words,
they
would
have
recognized
that
the
word
“perform”
in
the
copyright
statute
means
providing
a
visible
and
audible
rendition
of
the
work,
a
rendition
of
the
work.
we
think
this
is
the
meaning
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
statute.
it
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
problem
of
stage
plays
and
people
who
came
in
and
took
stenographic
notes
or
transcriptions
of
the
play
with
the
intention
of
giving
an
authorized
performance
at
a
later
date.
congress
is
also
concerned
with
the
nickelodeon
what
it
called
the
graphic
phone
and
the
phonograph
and
the
player
piano.
indeed
in
section
1
(e)
which
is
not
involved
here,
the
so-called
jukebox
provision,
in
order
to
provide
and
exception
from
the
public
performance
provision
for
a
jukebox,
the
congress
had
to
say
that
a
rendition
or
a
reproduction
of
the
music
was
not
a
public
performance
except
where
admission
were
charged.
this
is
in
my
--
our
minds
a
clear
indication
of
the
relationship
between
rendition
sight
and
sound
and
performance.
we
believe
that
to
hold
that
by
receiving
a
broadcast
signal
and
conducting
those
signals
with
whatever
equipment
is
needed
to
maintain
their
strength
to
the
homes
of
their
subscribers.
without
sight
or
sound
is
not
a
performance
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
and
does
not
meet
the
standards
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
white
smith
case.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
they're
doing
several
things.
a
broadcaster
is
in
a
very
different
kind
of
business
than
we're
in.
a
broadcaster's
business
is
to
procure
programming.
as
federal
communication
has
said,
his
--
the
essence
of
his
business
is
to
procure
programs.
he
can
either
procure
programs
by
having
a
program
in
his
own
studio
or
he
can
procure
the
program
by
having
it
performed
in
a
distant
studio.
and
his
job
is
to,
once
he
procured
the
program,
is
to
make
the
program
public
by
means
of
a
broadcast.
the
fact
that
he
gets
it
from
a
network
simply
means
that
his
studio
is
placed
at
some
distance
from
where
he
is.
it's
not
in
the
building
where
he's
actually
conducting
his
business.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
network
doesn't
originate,
your
honor.
the
network
does
not
broadcast.
the
network
provides
programs
to
stations
to
broadcast.
the
network
is
not
engaged
in
broadcasting.
it
is
simply
engaged
in
providing
programs.
it
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
stations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
stations
pay
or
in
the
instance
of
the
network,
the
network
provides
the
clearance
in
advance
for
the
stations,
but
it
is
not
the
network
which
is
the
broadcaster.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor
because
the
station
which
is,
as
you
say,
retransmitting
is
also
engaged
in
broadcasting.
and
the
fact
that
he
has
got
his
program
from
a
distant
studio
doesn't
make
any
difference
than
when
he
got
his
program
in
his
own
studio.he
is
procuring
a
program
for
the
purposes
of
broadcast.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
there
are.
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
the
physical
activities,
your
honor.
in
order
to
broadcast
the
station
which,
as
you
said,
retransmitted,
must
modulate
a
carrier
wave
in
order
to
broadcast
because
what
he
receives
is
a
video
or
sound
signal.
our
equipment
does
not
modulate
a
carrier
wave.
indeed,
one
of
the
misconceptions
of
the
district
court
was
that
we
are
the
same
as
the
broadcaster
because
we
modulate
a
carrier
wave.
the
truth
is
that
once
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
but
he
is
procuring
a
performance
in
another
location.
the
difference
between
the
location
within
his
building
and
the
location
outside
his
building
seems
to
me
to
be
not
very
significant,
but
what
he's
doing
is
asking
that
a
performance
be
made
someplace
else
and
doing
it
under
contract,
i.e.,
by
a
network
agreement.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
because
we're
making
no
arrangements
for
our
programs.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
him.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
be
in
advance.
we
don't
know
where
they
come
from,
and
we
don't
ex
--
we
don't
endeavor
to
exploit
them
as
programs.
we
sell
no
advertising.
we
do
nothing
with
them,
which
is
what
a
broadcaster
does
with
them.
this
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
to
sell
advertising
and
association
with
them.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
critical
issue
is
what
is
the
public
entitled
to
receive
off
the
air.
if
the
receiver
is
within
the
normal
service
area
of
a
station
where
the
signal
can
be
received
off
the
air,
in
our
view,
it
is
the
public's
right
to
receive,
which
should
be
given
--
paid
attention
to
here,
and
when
we
argue
the
second
branch
of
the
case,
i
will
argue
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
within
the
antenna
it
chooses,
that
this
is
the
nature
of
broadcasting
and
the
right
which
was
conferred.
and
indeed,
we
--
our
contention
is
that
the
copyright
owner
had
been
paid.
he
is
releasing
a
particular
form
of
his
work
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
a
broadcast.
he
is
releasing
it
because
he
licensed
the
broadcaster
and
he's
paid
for
that
broadcast,
and
the
people
who
receive
the
broadcast
off
the
air
are
the
people
for
whom
the
broadcast
was
intended
indeed
as
a
matter
of
law.
under
the
communications
act,
the
broadcast
must
be
that
which
is
intended
to
be
received
by
the
public.
and
in
our
view,
the
public
interest
is
what
is
paramount
here
as
to
the
right
to
receive
once
you
have
licensed
the
broadcast
itself.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
certainly
could
not
transcribe
it
or
record
it.
you
could
not
rebroadcast
it
because
section
325
forbids
rebroadcasting
and
we
are
not
a
broadcaster.
we
are
engaged
solely
and
exclusively
in
simultaneous
and
instantaneous
reception
off
the
air
of
a
television
signal.
our
--
the
courts
below
rely
on
buck
against
jewell-lasalle,
the
hotel
case,
and
we
think
erroneously
because
that
case
confirms
our
view
that
the
court
has
adhered
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
perform.
in
that
case,
the
hotels
was
held
to
have
performed
the
music
but
its
equipment
was
significantly
different
from
that
which
the
community
antenna
has.
the
hotel
not
only
had
an
antenna
and
a
connection
between
the
antenna
of
a
radio
set,
it
had
loudspeakers.
and
it
was
the
fact
that
it
provided
the
music
in
audible
form
in
the
loudspeakers
which
the
court
referred
to
in
connection
to
performance.
mr.
nizer
would
interpret
it
to
mean
that
if
the
hotel
simply
had
a
wire
down
to
a
radio
set
but
no
loudspeakers
so
that
you
heard
nothing
that
the
hotel
would
have
held
to
have
performed.
we
think
that
the
--
if
you
see
the
--
in
the
opinion,
the
significance
of
the
hearing
of
the
music
is
paramount
to
the
decision
in
that
case
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
because
the
court
said
it
was
the
translation
in
the
sound
of
the
musical
works
on
instrumentalities
under
the
hotel's
control,
which
was
the
reproduction
that
amounted
to
a
performance.
here,
there
was
no
translation
of
the
sound,
no
visible
nor
audible
reproduction
of
the
music,
and
we
think
therefore
that
the
hotel
case
actually
demonstrates
that
the
word
“perform”
does
not
apply
to
the
operations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
is
only
one
instance
--
well,
your
honor,
that
case
has
come
up
in
canada
where
they
--
the
system
provided
something
called
radio
diffusion.
it
provided
all
of
the
hotel
--
provided
all
of
the
equipment
in
the
homes.
the
canadian
court
said
that
the
performance
in
the
homes
or
the
rendition
in
the
homes
was
a
private
performance
and
that
when
the
radio
diffusion
system
had
sets
in
a
public
room,
that
part
of
its
operations
was
a
public
performance.
our
respondent
tried
its
case
on
the
theory
that
performance
could
be
found
in
the
electronic
function
of
our
equipment
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
view.
there
were
two
technological
alternates
which
were
urged
and
which
the
respondent
no
longer
urges
here.
first,
it
said
that
because
of
the
way
the
circuitry
has
worked
inside
the
television
--
inside
of
the
equipment,
there
was
an
electronic
reproduction
made
that
is
the
of
the
signal,
that
is
the
signal
that
came
out
of
the
tube,
had
the
same
electrical
characteristics,
and
that
this
was
a
reproduction
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act.
no
one
supports
this
view
here
and
the
almost
unbelievable
billions
of
numbers
of
tubes
that
would
be
involved
if
that
weren't
correct
is
an
indication
of
the
tremendous
sweep
of
this
position.
the
second
position
which
they
took
below
was
that
because
our
equipment
modulated
the
carrier
wave
that
its
electronic
function
was
like
a
broadcaster.
hence,
we
performed.
i
have
commented
on
this.
we
had
equipment
at
one
time
which
model
--
modulated
the
video
carrier
but
not
the
sound
carrier.
our
older
equipment
did
not.
the
more
modern
equipment
modulates
nothing,
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
since
modulation
is
neither
required
nor
typical
as
catv
equipment,
this
theory
of
performance
must
fall.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
may
i
suggest
your
honor
that
this
mixes
up
the
electromagnetic
energy
which
we
receive
and
the
copyrighted
work.
there
is
no
contention
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
they
get
mixed
up
in
the
argument
but
they
don't
get
mixed
up
in
fact
because
there's
no
doubt
that
the
copyright
is
not
on
the
electromagnetic
energy.
if
there
is
a
copyright,
it
is
on
the
movie
and
on
the
performance
of
the
movie.
and
so
far
as
the
electromagnetic
energy
is
concerned
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
when
you
go
to
the
movies?
you
see
light
or
a
picture.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
that
everything
could
be
reduced
to
electromagnetic
energy
because
i
guess
that's
all
we
are.
but
i
--
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
don't
feel
very
electromagnetic
but
it
does
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
it
does
confuse
what
the
statute
is
talking
about,
the
copyrighted
work
and
electromagnetic
energy
because
all
we
deal
with
or
conduct
or
amplify
or
convert
is
electromagnetic
energy,
and
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
a
copyright
on
that.
indeed,
it
could
not
be
copyrighted.
if
there
is
something
that
is
a
rendition
and
you
must
look
to
the
statute
as
to
what
it
covers.
if
there
is
a
performance,
in
our
view,
it
is
in
the
home
where
the
light
and
sound
appear.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
within
the
theory
which
was
just
suggested
here,
yes,
they
would
be
liable
and
one
of
the
points
which
we
have
made
is
that
the
various
theories
of
performance
urged
in
this
court
sweep
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
statute
not
only
community
antennas
but
the
apartment
house
antenna
which
is
so
common
in
this
area.
they
sweep
within
their
scope
the
common
carriers.
they
sweep
within
their
scope
new
methods
of
communication
which
are
just
on
the
horizon
because
they
include
within
their
scope
these
broad
elements
of
communication
or
the
dealing
in
electromagnetic
energy.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
that
case
--
that
point
came
up
specifically
in
the
record
and
it
is
no
doubt
that
the
function
of
the
apartment
house
antenna
is
exactly
the
same
as
ours,
respondent's
expert
so
testified,
and
the
equip
--
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
equipment
was
the
same.
we
were
not
permitted
to
make
that
--
good
on
that
offer,
but
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
equipment
was
the
same.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
that
that
was
conceded
but
no
effort
had
been
made
to
collect
from
anyone
prior
to
the
time
they
brought
suit
against
us.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
that's
correct,
sir.
i'm
talking
of
community
antennas
or
apartment
house
antennas.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
community
antennas
or
apartment
house
antennas.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
--
well,
there
are
two
varying
in
charges
depending
on
whether
they
paid
a
so-called
installation
fee
or
a
rental
fee.
it's
$3.75
if
they
paid
an
installation
fee
and
$5.00
if
they
paid
a
rental
fee.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
a
month.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
the
total
charge,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
indeed,
under
the
argument
which
is
here
in
this
court
now,
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
the
viewing
in
the
homes
is
not
even
relevant
to
the
question
whether
or
not
we
infringe
or
whether
or
not
we
perform
to
be
more
specific.
they
say
that
the
viewing
is,
as
they
said
in
the
opposition,
private
performance
and
in
their
brief
here,
they
say
it's
not
even
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly,
therefore
you
must
find
that
performance
in
the
wires
and
amplifiers
and
what
we
do
to
the
electromagnetic
energy
within
the
wires
and
amplifiers
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
there
are
no
such
fcc
rules,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
sir.
what
they
mean
is
that
you
block
out,
it
isn't
that
you
tape.
it
means
that
you
block
out.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
if
they
do,
it's
not
in
this
case
and
i
know
of
no
one
in
this
practice
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
statute
reads
specifically
on
the
making
of
a
transcription
or
a
record
of
a
copyrighted
at
work.
but
that
is
--
that's
illegal
because
the
statute
forbids
the
making.
it
isn't
because
it's
a
public
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
don't
know
--
there
are
great
many
apartment
house
antennas
in
washington
and
baltimore.
there
are
some
that
i
understand
are
constructed
close
here.
cumberland,
maryland
has
a
catv.
there
are
some
out
by
the
bay
that
the
communities
are
setting
up
catvs
and
i
think
there
are
some
around
the
metropolitan
area.
i
don't
know
of
any
in
the
metropolitan
area,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
in
new
york
city,
this
is
the
way
they
work.
they
--
under
the
franchise
in
new
york
city,
they
pick
up
only
local
cities.
new
york
from
the
point
of
view
of
electromagnetic
wave
is
a
horrid
area
because
it's
very
mountainous.
and
so,
reception
is
difficult
in
the
apartment
buildings
in
new
york,
so
that
they
do
use
antenna
systems
there
for
reception
and
to
improve
the
reception.
this
is
the
kind
of
function
which
we
contend
we're
doing
in
the
area
worthy
because
of
terrain
or
other
reasons
the
reception
is
difficult.
we
are
providing
a
service
that
makes
the
reception
better.
the
respondent
really
has
three
theories
of
performance
which
is
surging
in
this
court.
the
first
is
that
by
amplifying,
processing
and
retransmitting
electromagnetic
energy
we
are
performing,
every
television
set,
every
radio
set,
every
communications
common
carrier
does
that.
the
second
is
that
we
are
communicating
the
pictures
in
whatever
form
they
may
be
to
where
they
become
visible
or
audible.
this
is
the
separate
new
position
which
they
took
in
this
--
in
their
brief
in
the
court
this
time.
as
i
tried
to
comment
earlier,
i
think
this
confuses
the
signal
with
the
copyrighted
work.
the
rendition
of
the
work
which
they
say
is
irrelevant
to
performance
occurs
in
the
home
and
we
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
a
performance
without
a
rendition.
in
the
buck
case,
there
surely
would
not
have
been
a
performance
found
if
the
hotel
did
not
have
loudspeakers
on
which
it
made
the
music
audible
for
the
benefit
of
its
guests.
respondent
relies
on
three
broadcaster
cases
for
its
argument.
each
of
these
cases
involved
the
actual
performance
of
the
music
in
the
studio
of
the
broadcaster,
one
was
in
american
case,
the
remick
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
one
was
an
australian
case
and
one
was
a
british
case.
in
each
case,
there
was
--
there's
no
question
that
there
was
an
actually
rendition
of
the
work
in
the
studio.
the
issue
which
the
court
addressed
itself
to
is
whether
that
performance
had
been
made
public
by
the
broadcaster.
in
each
instance,
they
said
it
was
made
public.
the
broadcaster's
function
as
i
have
tried
to
say
is
significantly
different
both
from
a
physical
and
business
point
of
view
than
the
catv.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
this
problem
has
ramifications
in
copyright
law,
communications
regulations
and
anti-trust,
and
we
suggest
that
in
an
area
where
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
congressional
intent,
here
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
congressional
intent.
these
are
considerations
which
the
court
should
have
in
mind
in
construing
or
deciding
whether
to
extend
or
expand
the
monopoly
conferred
by
the
copyright
statute.
in
earlier
testimony
and
in
its
memorandum,
the
department
of
justice
points
out
the
anti-competitive
consequences
that
would
flow
if
infringement
were
imposed
on
catv.
as
i
said
earlier,
this
is
a
small
town
industry.
and
as
the
solicitor
has
said,
copyrights
are
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
networks
and
seven
movie
companies,
either
because
of
back
damages,
and
respondent
is
claiming
$250.00
minimum
damage
for
every
cartoon
and
every
movie
which
we
received.
on
the
basis
of
that
claim,
we
would
be
incurring
damages
at
the
rate
of
$1
million
a
month.
obviously,
this
opens
the
way
to
take
over
the
community
antenna
business.
but
even
apart
from
the
past
damages,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
copyright
infringement
is
imposed,
they
will
be
able
to
control
the
community
antennas
for
the
purposes
of
--
for
their
own
purposes
obviously.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
putting
a
community
antenna
on
a
business
by
the
size
of
the
fee
they
would
charge.
and
indeed,
they
have
said
that
we
were
carrying
programs
into
areas
that
they
would
otherwise
like
to
exploit
differently.
so
clearly,
they
want
to
cut
off
the
reception
of
the
programs
in
those
areas.
so
far
as
the
copyright
owner
is
concerned,
he
has
received
his
reward.
he's
been
paid
for
the
broadcast
as
i
had
said
earlier.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
this
and
we
offered
to
prove
that
the
copyright
owner
had
been
paid
not
only
for
the
audience
of
the
station
but
the
audience
which
included
the
catv
subscribers.
what
the
broadcasters
and
the
na
-
national
association
of
broadcasters'
brief
and
it
makes
clear
the
respondent
says
here
they
want
to
control
the
competition
between
stations
for
their
own
purposes.
they
want
to
cut
off
by
license
agreements
the
reception
of
the
signals
of
a
competing
station
when
it
suits
their
interest.
they
want
to
supplant
the
regulation
of
reception
by
license
exclusivity,
license
agreements
to
supplant
the
regulation
which
the
fcc
as
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest
has
been
explained
to
you
in
the
case
just
preceding.
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
the
same
power
in
the
use
of
exclusive
territories
which
concerned
the
court
in
the
schwene
case
and
the
albreck
case.
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
not
strain
to
expand
the
statute
in
order
to
encourage
this
kind
of
exclusivity.
this
brings
me
to
the
second
issue,
the
issue
of
the
license
implied
in
law.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
license
implied
in
law
to
receive
broadcasts
off
the
air.
if
it
be
assumed
that
our
systems
perform
the
copyrighted
works,
which
we
deny,
then
the
question
is,
does
the
public
have
a
license
implied
in
law
to
receive
the
broadcast
off
the
air
with
whatever
set
or
equipment
it
chooses,
including
a
community
antenna?
this
was
a
question
reserved
in
the
jewell-lasalle
case
and
as
the
court
below
said,
it's
presented
here
as
a
question
of
first
impression.
in
our
view,
the
public
has
the
right
to
receive
broadcasts
off
the
air
with
antennas
of
their
choice.
and
that
this
policy
--
this
is
based
on
the
policy
embodied
on
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act.
when
a
copyright
owner
has
licensed
a
broadcast,
he
has
received
his
reward
for
releasing
that
particular
embodiment
of
his
work
to
the
public.
i
emphasize
this,
your
honor,
because
there
has
been
confusion.
it's
been
said
that
we
are
--
say
the
work
is
dedicated
to
the
public.
that's
not
correct.
we
said
that
--
it's
been
said
that
we
are
charging
that
the
owner
loses
his
right
to
license
other
broadcast
stations.
it
said
that
work
falls
in
the
public
domain.
the
only
point
we
have
made
is
that
when
the
broadcast
--
when
the
copyright
owner
decides
to
license
a
broadcast,
the
public
has
a
right
to
receive
that
broadcast
off
the
air
with
its
antenna
of
its
choice,
including
catv,
and
that
the
copyright
owner
cannot
control
that
reception
or
put
a
second
charge
on
it.
respondent
says
there
is
no
such
license
implied
in
law.
it
says
it
doesn't
want
to
charge
the
public
and
wants
to
charge
the
community
antenna.
this
is
of
course
just
passing
beside
the
point
because
clearly,
a
charge
on
the
community
antenna
is
a
charge
on
the
public.
it's
a
charge
in
doing
business
and
will
be
passed
along.
and
certainly,
in
the
case
of
apartment
house
antennas,
it
would
be
a
charge
directly
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
our
position,
that
this
is
genuinely
a
charge
to
the
public.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
it's
conceded
that
this
non-infringing,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
they
claim
that
the
principle
is
do-it-yourself,
that
you
must
put
up
your
own
antenna,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
go
to
others
to
assist
you
in
reception
of
your
program
a
reception
of
the
broadcast.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
on
the
--
you're
getting
exactly
the
same
performance
on
a
private
antenna
as
you're
getting
on
the
community
antenna.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
if
i
underst
--
in
my
view,
yes.
but
if
i
understand
respondent's
position
correctly,
no,
their
view
is
that
the
viewing
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly.
they
have
also
stated
that
the
viewing
in
the
homes
is
a
private
performance,
not
a
public
performance.
now,
which
position
they're
taking
right
now,
i
don't
know.
the
respondent's
primary
legal
argument
is
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
do-it-yourself.
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
thing
as
a
homeowner
can
do
if
he
chooses
to
do
it.
what
they're
suggesting
is
that
an
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
it
quite
possibly
may,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
under
--
i
think
that
under
the
construction
of
the
rule
below
and
certainly
under
the
respondent's
theories
here,
the
gentleman
is
maybe
within
the
scope
of
the
copyright
monopoly
because
he
was
contributing,
he
was
providing
--
making
it
possible
for
you
to
view
what
otherwise
you
wouldn't
view.
as
i
was
saying,
the
main
legal
argument
that's
made
here
is
that
a
broadcast
is
different
from
a
sale
of
a
book
and
because
of
a
license
to
a
broadcaster
is
personal
while
a
sale
of
a
book
is
a
transfer
of
title
in
a
channel.
but
the
form
of
the
release
we
suggest
--
the
form
of
the
release
to
the
public
selected
by
the
monopolist,
the
copyright
owner
we
believe
is
not
important
in
this
context.
the
normal
method
for
release
of
a
book
is
sale.
the
normal
method
for
release
to
the
public
of
a
film
to
be
broadcast
is
by
broadcast.
the
controlling
issue
is
not
the
form
which
the
copyright
owner
chooses
to
release
to
the
public
but
the
pubic
policy
underlying
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
that
once
the
copyright
owner
has
been
paid,
and
he
has
been
paid
here,
then
the
public
policy
of
release
to
the
public
should
be
the
guiding
policy
and
the
public
should
be
entitled
to
receive
that
broadcast
by
any
means
it
finds
convenient,
including
a
do-it-yourself
or
a
community
antenna
if
it
chooses
to.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
the
first
one?
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
theatre
was
performing
within
the
meaning
buck
case.
this
is
providing
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it's
conceivable
that
we
would
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringement
but
we
would
not
be
liable
as
a
performer
because
we
are
not
giving
a
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
might
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringement
and
need
the
respond
that
has
said
that
it's
going
to
make
such
a
contention
but
so
far
as
we
can
see,
the
performance
is
done
by
the
theatre
in
your
illustration
and
not
by
us.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor.
i
find
a
little
hard
to
recognize
the
case.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
involving
the
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
as
it
appears
in
the
copyright
act.
mr.
nizer
refers
to
criminal
prosecution
in
1954
involving
a
man
who
cut
the
cable.
he
talks
about
station
wboy,
this
is
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
footnote
25
and
i
commend
the
court
to
that.
the
only
theory
on
which
he
tried
to
bring
this
within
the
statute
is
that
there
has
been
a
reception
or
a
transmission
as
he
says
for
profit.
the
statute
doesn't
read
on
reception
or
transmission.
the
statute
reads
on
perform
and
there
is
no
element
of
profit
in
section
1
(d)
but
there
is
in
1
(c).
the
statutes
briefs
on
perform
and
in
public.
mr.
nizer
says
that
he
does
not
wish
to
cover
master
antennas
but
there
is
no
way
in
which
you
can
exclude
master
antennas
if
reception
and
transmission
are
to
test.
that's
exactly
what
they
do.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
a
man
pays
for
his
master
antenna
service
and
his
rent
rather
than
pays
directly
for
the
service.
mr.
nizer
talked
about
advertising.
is
it
--
does
it
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
a
man
advertises
or
not
as
to
whether
he
performs
is
--
performing
when
it
says
something
in
its
ad
about
ads
for
television
sets.
you
can
see
the
world
series
game,
is
that
performing
the
world
series
game?
i
don't
understand
this.
i
don't
understand
the
relevance
of
this
at
all.
we
must
somehow
rather
get
back
to
the
statute
and
look
to
see
what
these
systems
do
and
how
it
fits
the
statutes.
mr.
nizer
talked
about
the
expensive
equipment.
we
hope
our
equipments
could.we
tried
to
buy
good
equipment
and
we
hope
we
provide
a
decent
service
to
our
people
and
we'll
certainly
try
to
do
better
for
our
subscribers
if
we
can.
he
talks
about
broadcasting.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
congressional
intent
as
to
the
community
antenna
but
the
evidence
of
congressional
intent
as
to
broadcasting
is
clear.
in
1952,
the
congress
amended
section
1
(c)
specifically
with
reference
to
broadcasting
thus
making
a
claim
that
the
congress
thought
that
broadcasting
was
covered
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
he
speaks
about
unfair
competition.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
commission
addresses
itself
to
what
it
regards
as
a
competitive
problem
and
its
rules
and
regulations
deal
with
that.
he
talks
about
the
local
station.
well,
there
is
no
doubt
that
reception
of
the
local
station
on
the
community
antenna
would
in
mr.
nizer's
views
being
infringement.
he
is
not
trying
to
provide
an
audience
for
the
local
station.
he
wants
to
prohibit
reception
in
order
that
he
can
practice
exclusivity
in
his
marketing.
he
talks
about
the
federal
communications
commission
being
concerned
with
this
matter
because
copyright
infringement
has
not
been
imposed
on
a
community
antenna.
this
is
just
plain
not
correct
as
mr.
gellar
said
today,
the
commission
has
found
the
community
antenna
provides
a
valuable
service
in
connection
with
the
reception
in
the
service
areas
of
the
stations.
this
is
precisely
what
it
does
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
do.
he
suggests
that
we
are
proposing
that
the
copyright
act
has
been
repealed
by
the
communications
act.
it's
not
correct
at
all.
our
position
is
that
the
public
policy
underlying
the
copyright
act
and
the
communications
act
should
be
considered
by
the
court
when
it
is
deciding
whether
or
not
to
extend
the
meaning
of
a
word
performs
in
a
noble
area,
an
area
not
contemplated
by
the
congress.
he
said
we
select
the
programs.
it's
completely
agreed
that
there
has
been
no
selection
of
programs
here
in
the
sense
that
we
did
not
receive
everything
that
is
on
the
air.
there
is
no
deletion,
no
picking
and
choosing.
we
select
the
programs
in
the
sense
that
our
systems
were
capable
of
receiving
five
stations
and
we
receive
five,
we
didn't
receive
six.
in
that
sense,
we
select
it
but
only
in
that
sense.
there
was
no
picking
and
choosing
of
programs.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
have
we
ever
picked
in
a
specific
program
and
receive
for
our
subscribers,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i
suppose
you
could
take
a
switch
and
turn
it
off
and
on,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
only
by
cutting
off
the
reception
of
one
of
the
three.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
technically,
you
could
switch
from
one
station
to
another.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
there's
been
no
deletion
of
broadcast.
we
have
received
the
entire
broadcast.we
received
it
simultaneously
with
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir,
subject
going
to
shutdown
for
failure
of
equipment.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
five
different
stations,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct
sir.
and
he
turns
it
off
or
on
as
he
sees
fit.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
at
or
were
not
to
listen
to
any
which
i'm
sure
many
of
them
elect.
we
suggest
also
your
honor
that
the
issue.
there's
no
question
about
the
rightness
of
the
issue
here.
the
question
is
under
the
statute,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
issue
is
here.
the
issue
implied
in
law
is
that
which
was
reserved
in
the
buck
case.
in
the
buck
case,
the
broadcast
was
unauthorized
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
agree
sir.
in
our
view,
the
construction
of
the
statute
should
take
into
account
as
the
solicitor
suggests
the
harmonizing
of
the
copyright
laws,
communications
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that
if
one
looks
at
the
consequences
in
this
situation,
the
obvious
conclusion
is
that
the
statute
should
not
be
extended
into
a
new
area,
a
noble
area
and
not
contemplated
by
the
congress
that
this
is
a
subject
which
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
congress
and
should
not
be
handled
by
judicial
construction
where
the
consequences
are
those
which
the
solicitor
general
has
foreseen
and
it
is
our
view
therefore
that
we
are
not
proposing
a
violation
that
a
repeal
where
proposing
is
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
right
begins
to
power
which
we
think
is
the
guiding
rule
here.
the
ordinary
common
sense
meaning
of
the
word
“perform”
and
under
that
standard,
we
do
not
perform
we're
providing
a
reception
service.
if
there
are
no
questions
your
honor,
i've
concluded.
