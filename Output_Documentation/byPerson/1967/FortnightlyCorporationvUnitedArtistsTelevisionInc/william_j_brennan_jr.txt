justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
that
the
thought
that
all
these
systems
do
is
enhance
the
efficiency
of
the
receiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
something
--
i
live
in
the
section
of
washington
where
i
don't
get
some
stations
very
well.
i'll
use
an
antenna
and
that
gets
me
the
local
signals
because
i
could
not
get
them
without
an
antenna.
and
is
that
what
you're
suggesting
as
all
the
catv
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
barnard
that
merely
pick
up
local
signals
if
that's
the
reception
of
local
signals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
the
position
was
that
when
i
hire
someone
as
i
did
and
paid
a
lot
of
money
for
it
to
put
up
one
of
these
fancy
antennas
that
runs
by
electric
clocks,
that
that
was
the
do-it-yourself
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
probably
costs
me
a
lot
more
than
if
i
got
one
of
--
subscribe
to
one
of
your
community
antenna
services,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
misunderstood
mr.
nizer.
that
wasn't
my
point
at
all.
my
point
was,
how
would
possibly
be
regarded
as
a
do-it-yourself
job
what's
on
the
top
of
my
roof,
so
it
was,
nothing
to
do
with
what
his
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
going
to
get
around
and
then
telling
us
why
it
isn't
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
mr.
nizer.
what's
this
proposal
now
to
bring
catv
explicitly
within
the
copyright
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
--
i
didn't
quite
get
you.
you
said
something
about
license
and
the
proposal
being
considered
was
made
by
whom,
by
the
copyright
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
issue
we
have
to
decide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
what
is
this
bill,
it's
proposal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
explicitly
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
someone
else
is
trying
to
get
something
explicit
to
include
them,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
that
will
depend
on
how
we
come
out
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
nizer,
i
don't
follow
this
if
you're
talking
within
the
a
area.
there's
only
one
showing
by
the
local
broadcasting
station
right?
motion
picture
is
on
and
there
it
is
and
it's
on
at
nine
o'clock
at
night
and
all
those
television
receivers
in
the
a
area
would
receive
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one
show
--
that's
one
performance.
now
how
is
it
become
two
when
everybody
in
that
are
uses
a
catv
service
to
improve
their
reception
of
that
one
showing.
how
does
it
become
two
performances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
is
not
performing.
there's
only
one
performance
at
my
home
that
i
can't
get
it
without
the
help
of
the
catv
service
because
the
reception
on
my
set
is
not
that
good
or
if
it
is
good,
it's
not
good
enough
for
me.
so
i
take
the
catv
service
to
improve
my
reception
of
it.
but
all
i'm
watching
is
the
motion
picture
as
it's
broadcast
by
the
local
tv
station.
that's
all.
that's
one
performance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
difference
does
it
matter
if
in
new
york
city
there
are
million
homes
would
perceive
the
same
performance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
that's
really
the
knob
of
this
case
isn't
it?
is
that
another
performance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
this
court
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
this
court
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
this
is
all
on
the
--
on
the
premises
mr.
nizer.
you
persuaded
us
that
what
catv
does
is
a
performance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
that
if
we
agree
with
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
ever
get
to
that
if
i
agree
with
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
