you
don’t
--
you
may
be
right,

there’s
no
case
holding
that
is
there?
justice

stewart
but
i
thought,
alright
just
at
the
analytical
level.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
cases
have
held
that
that
is
a
matter
entirely
for
the
grand
jury
as
to
on
what
bases
they’re
going
to
bring
in
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
get
at
it?
justice
potter
stewart
given
the
strong
traditions
at

in
the
federal
system
of
grand
jury
secrecy,
how
do
you
get
at
this?
justice

stewart
call
the
grand

or
do
you
call
--
who
do
you
call
as
a

so
what
do
you
do,
excuse
me.

there
would

it
would
have
to
be.
justice

well
--

pro

that

invades
the

for
whatever
that’s
worth.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
now
that
maybe
i
should
listen.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
seem
to
me,
just
as
a
matter
practical
trial
strategy
that
the
answers
you
got
were
more
useful
to
you,
if
they
couldn’t
remember
from
whom
and
when
and
how
much
they
took
the
money
from.
that
would
make
their
testimony
in
your
case
very
reliable,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
they’ve
been
awfully
precise,
the
jury
might
have
thought
their
memories
were
better
than
you
showed
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
that
that
was
the
precise
argument
that
was
available
to
you
on
the
basis
of
the
answers
you
did
elicit,
but
that
is
not
a
point
worth
pursuing
anyway.
