mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
before
turning
to
the
argument
of
the
two
principle
issues
raised
in
this
case,
i
want
to
point
out
one
fact
omitted
by
the
petitioner
and
pulling
out
all
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
two
main
issues
in
this
case
developed.
the
seven
internal
revenue
employees
involved
who
are
witnesses
in
the
case,
six
were
indicted
along
with
petitioner
and
the
seventh
was
indicted
in
a
separate
indictment.
so
these
seven
witnesses
were
in
a
sense
different
than
the
normal
witness
you
have
in
a
normal
situation,
in
a
normal
case.
now,
what
happened
is,
they
--
each
of
these
witnesses
testified
on
direct
examination
that
they
accepted
bribes
from
petitioner.
their
direct
examination
was
only
concerned
with
their
transactions
with
petitioner.
they
didn’t,
in
their
direct
examination
--
they
didn’t
go
into
any
other
bribes
with
any
other
accountants.
after
the
direct
examine
--
after
the
first
witness
testified
on
direct
examination,
petitioner
made
a
blank
at
the
man
for
all
statements
made
by
the
witness.
after
this
blank
at
the
man,
the
government
turned
over
statements,
affidavits
of
the
witnesses
and
some
of
the
affidavits
were
turned
over
directly
to
defense
counsel.
other
affidavits,
the
government
told
the
court
that
had
matters
in
them
which
did
not
relate
to
the
direct
examination.
so
the
court
examined
those
affidavits
in-camera,
and
as
result
of
its
examination
what
was
actually
turned
over
the
government,
the
government
had
prepared
it
in
advance
were
affidavits
with
certain
portions
excised
--
would
have
--
with
certain
portions
of
it
with
material
excised
from
it.
and
what
wasn’t
turned
over
were
statements
concerning
the
petitioner’s
transactions
with
other
accountants.
now
each
of
the
--
included
in
the
material
turned
over
were
grand
jury
testimony
of
these
witnesses.
these
witnesses,
each
of
these
witnesses
had
testified
before
a
previous
grand
jury.
this
was
in
the
initial
stage
of
investigation
which
involved
widespread
corruption
in
the
new
york
internal
revenue
office
and
at
this
previous,
in
the
initial
stage
before
this
first
grand
jury,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
had
named
petitioner
as
a
person
who
had
paid
him
bribes.
the
testimony
before
the
previous
grand
jury
however
somewhat
the
--
the
previous
grand
jury
didn’t
try
to
develop
all
the
names
of
all
of
the
accountants
who
had
received
bribes
from
petitioner.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
defendant
--
as
each
witness
testified,
found
out
that
none
of
these
witnesses
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
which
had
indicted
petitioner.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
he
moved
the
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
none
of
the
witnesses
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
asked
the
court
to
examine
the
grand
jury
testimony.
at
this
point
the
court
overruled
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
refused
to
examine
the
grand
jury
testimony.
as
i
read
the
record,
at
no
time
did
petitioner
ask
to
have
this
grand
jury
testimony.
the
grand
jury
testimony
involved
in
this
case
turned
over
to
him.
now
his
first
contention
is
that
costello
versus
united
states
should
either
be
reexamined
or
overruled.
we
see
nothing
in
this
case
to
warrant
the
reexamination
or
overruling
costello.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know
the
practice
varies
with
the
individual
u.s.
attorney.
now
of
course
now
in
the
second
circuit
as
a
result
of
this
case
and
as
a
result
of
another
case,
it’ll
be
prudent
for
the
u.s.
attorney
–
any
u.s.
attorney
in
the
second
circuit
to
offer
firsthand
testimony
of
the
witnesses
because
in
this
case
the
court
said
unless
there
are
some
unusual
reasons
whenever
possible,
firsthand
witnesses
should
be
used
before
the
grand
jury,
so
as
far
as
the
practice
which
will
be
followed
in
the
second
circuit
any
prudent
prosecutor
will
offer
some
firsthand
testimony
unless
he
has
some
reason
not
to.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it’s
not
the
justice
department.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
as
far
as
i
know
there’s
no
justice
department
policy.
it
all
depends
on
the
individual
u.s.
attorney.
what
i
did
say
was
that
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
case
that
the
u.s.
attorney
in
new
york
is
adopting
a
policy
which
the
opinion
says
that
wherever
possible
firsthand
--
witnesses
with
firsthand
information
should
be
used
before
the
grand
jury.
i
said
its
prudent
being
in
the
second
circuit
for
him
to
do
it
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
from
the
u.s.
attorney’s
letter
of
the
second
circuit,
i
would
assume
that
it
was
common
for
--
to
put
on
an
agent
and
not
offer
firsthand
information
in
cases
which
originated
through
the
investigation
agencies.
now
that
would
be
different
in
the
case
where
the
grand
jury
did
its
own
investigation,
but
that
is
apparently
the
practice
in
new
york.
now
i
do
not
know
that
that
practice
existed
elsewhere.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
this
is
the
southern
district
and
this
case
arises
out
of
the
southern
district.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
the
southern
district
is
following
the
admonition
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
think
it’s
confined
with
tax
cases.
i
mean,
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
doesn’t
say
he
confined
it
to
tax
cases.
of
course
you
know
there
are
some
tax
cases
where
the
grand
jury
investigates
themselves.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
that
in
other
districts
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
that
in
other
districts
there
are
cases
where
u.s.
attorneys
use
the
agent,
the
agent
instead
of
using
firsthand
witnesses.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
i
would
assume
that
it
also
has
occurred
in
non-tax
cases.
i
don’t
--
i
would
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
it
could
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
have
no
idea,
no.
now
one
suggestion
which
we
have
made,
it’s
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
if
a
particular
district
judge
is
dissatisfied
with
the
quality
of
test
--
of
evidence
being
presented
before
the
grand
jury.
we
suggest
a
simple
solution
and
that’s
on
empaneling
a
grand
jury
the
district
judge
can
instruct
the
grand
jury
as
to
the
quality
of
evidence.
and
so
instead
of
waiting
until
after
the
grand
jury
has
heard
the
case
and
adopting
a
drastic
remedy
dismissing
indictments,
it
seems
you
can
adopt
as
prophylactic
measure
and
that
solves
the
problem.
i
mean
if
the
particular
district
is
using
what
the
judge
can
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
that
also
be
a
solution
to
the
problem.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
we
certainly
couldn’t
bind
the
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
if
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
return
an
indictment
on
its
own,
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence
the
u.s.
attorney
couldn’t
bind
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
after
all
is
an
independent
body.
and
traditionally
it
has
been
considered
to
be
the
protection
a
defendant
has
against
arbitrary
indictment.
instead
of
having
an
elected
official,
the
constitution
has
provided
for
these
lay
people
to
hear
the
case
unhampered
by
technical
rules.
my
suggestion
when
i
was
--
if
district
judges
do
not
like
or
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
prefer
better
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
certainly
the
department
would
on
its
own,
would
try
to
offer
firsthand
testimony
and
suggest
it
to
the
grand
jury.
but
the
grand
jury,
we
submit,
has
the
power
to
act
on
hearsay
evidence.
after
all
its
function
is
only
to
determine
the
probable
cause
and
the
probable
cause
--
you
take
a
situation
like
this
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case
you
have
six
people
who
are
indicted
as
co-defendants.
now,
it
so
happened
that
they
were
cooperating
with
the
government,
but
if
they
hadn’t
been
cooperating
with
the
government
or
the
government
wasn’t
sure
of
the
cooperation,
it
seems
to
me
that
it’d
be
adequate
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
because
they
sometimes
change
their
mind.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
adequate
for
the
government
to
present
the
affidavits
of
the
six
people,
indicating
that
they
had
committed
a
crime.
this
is
certainly
reliable
information.
after
all
a
--
people
don’t
ordinarily
put
their
--
subject
themselves
to
punishment
or
to
loss
of
jobs
by
admitting
they
have
committed
an
offense.
and
so
the
grand
jury
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
had
very
reliable
evidence
and
they
had
sufficient
evidence
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
i
didn’t
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i
don’t
suggest
that
we
were
tried
--
the
department
of
justice
would
try
to
stop
the
grand
jury
from
hearing
hearsay
evidence.
i
just
suggest
that
the
department
of
justice
when
they
assist
a
grand
jury
would
find
it
prudent
in
view
of
criticism
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
offer
firsthand
testimony.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
the
law
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
i
don't
think
the
law
is
the
other
way.
i
think
the
law
is
that
a
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
act
on
its
own.
i
think
the
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
act
on
its
own,
and
if
the
grand
jury
can
hear
any
type
of
evidence
that
it
wants.
all
i’m
suggesting
is
if
the
court
of
appeals
like
the
second
circuit
is
done
in
this
case
has
said
that
where
practical
the
u.s.
attorney
should
offer
the
grand
jury
first
hand
evidence.
i
say
it’s
prudent
for
the
u.s.
attorney
to
do
this
because
if
you’re
going
to
--
why
get
yourself
involved
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
trial
long
involved
lawsuit,
and
at
the
very
tail
end,
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
say
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
grand
jury
procedure.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
though
i
think
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
the
right
may
--
i
think
the
suggestion
may
have
come
from
a
case,
an
earlier
case
which
they
had
where
there
was
a
dispute
between,
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
there
had
been
a
witness
--
an
agent
who
testified
they
had
deceived
the
grand
jury.
and
in
order
--
and
i
think
it
was
in
response
and
that
was
in
the
payton
case
and
it
was
a
two
to
one
decision
on
the
second
circuit.
and
now
i
think
in
this
case
–
because
this
case
followed
that
up,
and
i
think
what
they
wanted
to
do
is
avoid
a
situation
where
somebody
could
say
the
agent
who’s
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
agent
testified
before
the
grand
jury
indicated
the
grand
jury
had
personal
knowledge
with
certain
fact
when
he
didn’t.
and
the
court
--
i
think
that
was
the
response
of
the
--
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
it.
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
let
me
get
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case.
the
jencks
act
or
statute
provides
that
after
a
witness
testifies
on
direct
examination,
upon
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
government
shall
turn
over
all
statements
of
the
witness
which
relates
to
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
the
witness
has
testified.
and
if
material
doesn’t
relate
to
the
subject
matter,
the
court
shall
examine
the
statement
in-camera
and
shall
excise
the
portion
of
the
statements
which
do
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
testimony.
now
in
this
particular
case,
the
court,
the
trial
judge
we
believe
did
turn
over
the
material
which
should
have
been
turned
over
and
the
material
which
was
not
turned
over
was
properly
kept
from
the
defendant.
now
the
trial
judge
in
determining
what
related
in
this
to
the
subject
matter
upon
which
the
witness
has
testified
didn’t
adopt
any
narrow
rule.
he
gave
them
--
the
defense
got
the
affidavits
which
concerned
the
activities
to
which
witnesses
testified
on
direct
examination.
in
addition,
the
defense
obtained
earlier
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
witnesses
even
though
only
one
of
the
witnesses
as
mentioned
petitioner,
and
even
as
to
the
statements.
even
statements
which
didn’t
mention
petitioner
in
two
instances
were
turned
over
to
petitioner
and
these
statements
mentioned
acts
of
other
accountants.
the
full
record
and
not
just
the
printed
appendix
in
this
case
shows
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
--
initially
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
third
witness,
a
former
employee
named
diche
(ph)
was
not
turned
over.
the
court
after
reading
the
exhibit
noticed
a
question
in
this
grand
jury’s
act
testimony
which
said
“did
anybody
else
give
you
any
money?”
and
the
witness
at
that
time
didn’t
name
umans.
the
court
said
“this
material
should
be
turned
over.”
and
what
the
court
says
“at
least
the
defendant
could
argue
that
at
that
particular
time
in
the
grand
jury,
the
witness
either
did
not
remember
or
could
not
remember
or
did
not
want
to
remember
umans’
name.”
so
we
have
a
situation
where
what
the
court
was
trying
to
do
was,
was
trying
to
turn
over
--
is
turning
over
any
material
which
related
to
umans
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
from
disclosure
a
material
which
related
to
other
accountants
individuals
who
hadn’t
been
--
who
had
been
indicted
and
which
were
--
and
who
were
awaiting
trial.
now
the
issue
thus,
is
whether
this
peripheral
matter
has
to
be
turned
over.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
court
has
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
court
has
discretion
at
trial
to
cut
off
all
examination
as
to
other
acts
of
bribery.
the
court
doesn’t
have
to
allow
a
defense
counsel
to
get
into
the
--
to
allow
him
to
cross-examine
upon
--
and
try
to
impeach
a
witness
with
other
acts
of
misconduct
not
amounting
to
criminal
conviction.
but
here
the
court,
the
court
did
allow
this
--
did
allow
these
witnesses
to
be
examined
concerning
these
other
bribes,
but
what
the
court
didn’t
turn
over
and
properly
didn’t
turn
over
was
the
particulars.
in
other
words,
he
didn’t
turn
over
the
defense's
statements
which
said
that
on
a
particular
day
involving
a
particular
tax
return,
the
particular
accountant
who
may
have
been
awaiting
trial
on
a
separate
indictment
paid
the
agent
a
particular
sum
of
money.
we
don’t
think
that
--
we
think
the
jencks
act
--
this
is
a
type
of
a
material
which
the
jencks
act
meant
to
keep
confidential,
especially
since
it
involves
what
we
say
is
needless
disclosure
of
other
people.
petitioner’s
cross-examination
wasn’t
hampered.
he
was
allowed
to
question
each
of
the
witnesses
as
to
the
various
amounts
of
money
they
received
from
other
people.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
yes
that’s
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
in
addition
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
the
–
no,
at
the
trial.
no,
the
trial
turned
over
grand
jury
testimony
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
sure
we
agree
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
that’s
right
and
that’s
what
the
court,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
portion
of
the
transcript
it’s
in
page
162
and
163
of
the
original
transcript,
it
isn’t
printed,
the
court
did
when
he
noticed
that
one
of
these
documents
did
name
either
accountants,
he
did
turn
over
that
type
of
material,
and
also
that
there
are
two
other
affidavits
which
name
other
accountants,
don’t
name
petitioner
one
as
exhibit
107
involving
the
witness
ellington,
the
other
one
is
128
(a)
involving
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
for
some
reason
the
witness
ellington
was
not
cross-examined
except
with
his
grand
jury
testimony
just
for
two
pages.
the
witness
ryan
was
cross-examined
extensively
not
only
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
he
had
that
material.
now
how
much
use
he
made
of
it,
he
--
i
don’t
recall,
but
he
had
it
and
i
think
what
he
did
is
he
may
had
it
marked
as
a
defense
exhibit
and
it
was
given
to
the
jury.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
would
have
i
–
in
first
place
i
can’t
conceive
of
a
prosecutor
doing
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
would
say
if
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence,
no
evidence,
i
would
have
trouble
with
the
case.
i
would
think
that’s
--
you
could
find
some
sort
of
abuse,
maybe
the
government,
this
is
overreaching
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
should
give
the
grand
jury
something.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
the
--
that
the
--
i
have
no
objection
to
--
in
this
case
there
is
a
probable
cause.
i
have
--
with
the
problem
i
have
in
the
case
it
seems
to
me
that
i
don’t
see
the
real
need
for
putting
an
intervening
step
with
--
in
this
type
of
situation.
i
think
as
long
as
there
is
some
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
should
be
sufficient,
because
unlike
the
motion
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
--
well
of
course,
if
there’s
--
and
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
any
evidence,
if
there’s
any
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
should
be
sufficient,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
no
evidence
--
if
there’s
absolutely
--
if
there’s
an
absolutely
no
evidence
in
that
particular
situation
that’s
where
i’d
say
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there
have
to
be
some
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
there’s
absolutely
no
evidence,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
some
evidence
and
especially
in
a
case
--
and
of
course
in
this
case,
i
think
there’s
clear
evidence
of
probable
cause.
i
don’t
think
that
requires
an
examination
by
the
court.
but
my
problem
with
the
no
evidence
situation
is
if
the
grand
jury
on
its
own
would
go
ahead
and
indict
and
it
was
an
unbiased
grand
jury
and
did
it
on
the
basis
of
its
own
knowledge,
i
would
say
it’s
a
valid
indictment.
where
i
have
trouble
is
the
situation
where
the
u.s.
attorney
knowing,
with
knowledge
of
the
law
has
some
evidence,
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
has
a
duty
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
and
not
just
say
indict
so
and
so.
that’s
why
it’s
a
--
in
connection
with
the
no
evidence
case,
i
think
that
may
not
be
--
that
is
basically
a
problem
where
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
has
sort
of
overreached
or
perhaps
deceived
the
grand
jury.
i
don’t
think
the
u.s.
attorney
should
do
that.
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
should
try
to
give
some
evidence
to
grand
jury.
however,
i
think
the
grand
jury
on
its
own
decides
to
indict
somebody
on
its
own
knowledge,
and
i
think
it’s
a
valid
indictment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
of
course
that
indictment
will
only
be
valid
as
i
understand
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
cox
case
which
requires
its
u.s.
attorney
to
sign
the
indictment.
i
can’t
conceive
of
the
u.s.
attorney
signing
an
indictment
in
that
situation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
was
the
dispute
in
this
case
--
in
the
case
involving
down
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
my
recollection
is
when
that
case
went
up
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
--
it
had
said
they
couldn’t
proceed
with
the
trial,
that
the
indictment
required
a
signature
of
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
you’re
faced
unless
you’re
going
through
the
change
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
traditional
notion
of
the
grand
jury
was
that
the
grand
jury
could
act
on
its
own
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
sure.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct.
it’s
a
rare
grand
jury
where
it’ll
act
on
its
own,
but
if
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
correct.
i
think
there’s
a
protection
which
we
can
overlook
in
the
fact
that
it’s
not
one
of
the
grand
juries,
not
one
person.
the
grand
jury
takes
12
people
and
the
grand
jury
doesn’t
sit
permanently.
you
have
a
constant
change
over
in
grand
juries,
so
you
don’t
have
a
situation
where
you
have
an
arbitrary
elected
official
who
might
be
doing
something.
here’s
a
grand
jury
which
been
sitting
for
a
short
span
of
time
then
it
takes
12
people
have
to
go
haywire
and
not
just
one,
and
to
have
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
not
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
often
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
but
as
we
point
out
in
that
brief,
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
abuse
from
this
situation
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
one
of
the
state
that
i’m
very
familiar
with
missouri
is
an
alternative.
the
prosecutor
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
an
alternative
in
every
case.
he
can
either
proceed
by
information.
if
he
proceeds
by
information
then
the
defendants
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
if
he
proceeds
by
information,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
preliminary
hearing,
or
if
he
proceeds
by
indictment,
the
indictment
eliminates
preliminary
hearing.
in
other
words,
he
has
an
alternative,
but
in
the
--
as
to
a
state
where
the
prosecutor
just
has
the
right,
you
know,
going
in
a
case
by
information,
i’m
not
sure
whether
the
procedure
would
require
a
preliminary
hearing
or
not
or
whether
the
--
just
the
oath
of
the
prosecutor
would
be
sufficient
and
would
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
provide.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i’m
sure
that’s
a
practice
and
i
--
it’s
the
english
practice
as
i
understand
it
now
also
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
don’t
know
what
the
rule
is.
i
just
know
that
in
one
state,
the
rule
is
when
they
proceed
by
information
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing.
now
whether
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
where
there
is
probable
cause,
probable
cause
is
the
issue.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct,
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i’m
not
--
i
just
know
the
--
i
think
the
english
procedure
they
file
an
information
and
there’s
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
very
extensive
preliminary
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
sure,
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
before
turning
to
the
argument
of
the
two
principle
issues
raised
in
this
case,
i
want
to
point
out
one
fact
omitted
by
the
petitioner
and
pulling
out
all
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
two
main
issues
in
this
case
developed.
the
seven
internal
revenue
employees
involved
who
are
witnesses
in
the
case,
six
were
indicted
along
with
petitioner
and
the
seventh
was
indicted
in
a
separate
indictment.
so
these
seven
witnesses
were
in
a
sense
different
than
the
normal
witness
you
have
in
a
normal
situation,
in
a
normal
case.
now,
what
happened
is,
they
--
each
of
these
witnesses
testified
on
direct
examination
that
they
accepted
bribes
from
petitioner.
their
direct
examination
was
only
concerned
with
their
transactions
with
petitioner.
they
didn’t,
in
their
direct
examination
--
they
didn’t
go
into
any
other
bribes
with
any
other
accountants.
after
the
direct
examine
--
after
the
first
witness
testified
on
direct
examination,
petitioner
made
a
blank
at
the
man
for
all
statements
made
by
the
witness.
after
this
blank
at
the
man,
the
government
turned
over
statements,
affidavits
of
the
witnesses
and
some
of
the
affidavits
were
turned
over
directly
to
defense
counsel.
other
affidavits,
the
government
told
the
court
that
had
matters
in
them
which
did
not
relate
to
the
direct
examination.
so
the
court
examined
those
affidavits
in-camera,
and
as
result
of
its
examination
what
was
actually
turned
over
the
government,
the
government
had
prepared
it
in
advance
were
affidavits
with
certain
portions
excised
--
would
have
--
with
certain
portions
of
it
with
material
excised
from
it.
and
what
wasn’t
turned
over
were
statements
concerning
the
petitioner’s
transactions
with
other
accountants.
now
each
of
the
--
included
in
the
material
turned
over
were
grand
jury
testimony
of
these
witnesses.
these
witnesses,
each
of
these
witnesses
had
testified
before
a
previous
grand
jury.
this
was
in
the
initial
stage
of
investigation
which
involved
widespread
corruption
in
the
new
york
internal
revenue
office
and
at
this
previous,
in
the
initial
stage
before
this
first
grand
jury,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
had
named
petitioner
as
a
person
who
had
paid
him
bribes.
the
testimony
before
the
previous
grand
jury
however
somewhat
the
--
the
previous
grand
jury
didn’t
try
to
develop
all
the
names
of
all
of
the
accountants
who
had
received
bribes
from
petitioner.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
defendant
--
as
each
witness
testified,
found
out
that
none
of
these
witnesses
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
which
had
indicted
petitioner.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
he
moved
the
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
none
of
the
witnesses
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
asked
the
court
to
examine
the
grand
jury
testimony.
at
this
point
the
court
overruled
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
refused
to
examine
the
grand
jury
testimony.
as
i
read
the
record,
at
no
time
did
petitioner
ask
to
have
this
grand
jury
testimony.
the
grand
jury
testimony
involved
in
this
case
turned
over
to
him.
now
his
first
contention
is
that
costello
versus
united
states
should
either
be
reexamined
or
overruled.
we
see
nothing
in
this
case
to
warrant
the
reexamination
or
overruling
costello.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know
the
practice
varies
with
the
individual
u.s.
attorney.
now
of
course
now
in
the
second
circuit
as
a
result
of
this
case
and
as
a
result
of
another
case,
it’ll
be
prudent
for
the
u.s.
attorney
–
any
u.s.
attorney
in
the
second
circuit
to
offer
firsthand
testimony
of
the
witnesses
because
in
this
case
the
court
said
unless
there
are
some
unusual
reasons
whenever
possible,
firsthand
witnesses
should
be
used
before
the
grand
jury,
so
as
far
as
the
practice
which
will
be
followed
in
the
second
circuit
any
prudent
prosecutor
will
offer
some
firsthand
testimony
unless
he
has
some
reason
not
to.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it’s
not
the
justice
department.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
as
far
as
i
know
there’s
no
justice
department
policy.
it
all
depends
on
the
individual
u.s.
attorney.
what
i
did
say
was
that
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
case
that
the
u.s.
attorney
in
new
york
is
adopting
a
policy
which
the
opinion
says
that
wherever
possible
firsthand
--
witnesses
with
firsthand
information
should
be
used
before
the
grand
jury.
i
said
its
prudent
being
in
the
second
circuit
for
him
to
do
it
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
from
the
u.s.
attorney’s
letter
of
the
second
circuit,
i
would
assume
that
it
was
common
for
--
to
put
on
an
agent
and
not
offer
firsthand
information
in
cases
which
originated
through
the
investigation
agencies.
now
that
would
be
different
in
the
case
where
the
grand
jury
did
its
own
investigation,
but
that
is
apparently
the
practice
in
new
york.
now
i
do
not
know
that
that
practice
existed
elsewhere.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
this
is
the
southern
district
and
this
case
arises
out
of
the
southern
district.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
the
southern
district
is
following
the
admonition
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
think
it’s
confined
with
tax
cases.
i
mean,
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
doesn’t
say
he
confined
it
to
tax
cases.
of
course
you
know
there
are
some
tax
cases
where
the
grand
jury
investigates
themselves.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
that
in
other
districts
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
that
in
other
districts
there
are
cases
where
u.s.
attorneys
use
the
agent,
the
agent
instead
of
using
firsthand
witnesses.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
i
would
assume
that
it
also
has
occurred
in
non-tax
cases.
i
don’t
--
i
would
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
it
could
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
have
no
idea,
no.
now
one
suggestion
which
we
have
made,
it’s
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
if
a
particular
district
judge
is
dissatisfied
with
the
quality
of
test
--
of
evidence
being
presented
before
the
grand
jury.
we
suggest
a
simple
solution
and
that’s
on
empaneling
a
grand
jury
the
district
judge
can
instruct
the
grand
jury
as
to
the
quality
of
evidence.
and
so
instead
of
waiting
until
after
the
grand
jury
has
heard
the
case
and
adopting
a
drastic
remedy
dismissing
indictments,
it
seems
you
can
adopt
as
prophylactic
measure
and
that
solves
the
problem.
i
mean
if
the
particular
district
is
using
what
the
judge
can
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
that
also
be
a
solution
to
the
problem.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
we
certainly
couldn’t
bind
the
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
if
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
return
an
indictment
on
its
own,
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence
the
u.s.
attorney
couldn’t
bind
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
after
all
is
an
independent
body.
and
traditionally
it
has
been
considered
to
be
the
protection
a
defendant
has
against
arbitrary
indictment.
instead
of
having
an
elected
official,
the
constitution
has
provided
for
these
lay
people
to
hear
the
case
unhampered
by
technical
rules.
my
suggestion
when
i
was
--
if
district
judges
do
not
like
or
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
prefer
better
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
certainly
the
department
would
on
its
own,
would
try
to
offer
firsthand
testimony
and
suggest
it
to
the
grand
jury.
but
the
grand
jury,
we
submit,
has
the
power
to
act
on
hearsay
evidence.
after
all
its
function
is
only
to
determine
the
probable
cause
and
the
probable
cause
--
you
take
a
situation
like
this
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case
you
have
six
people
who
are
indicted
as
co-defendants.
now,
it
so
happened
that
they
were
cooperating
with
the
government,
but
if
they
hadn’t
been
cooperating
with
the
government
or
the
government
wasn’t
sure
of
the
cooperation,
it
seems
to
me
that
it’d
be
adequate
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
because
they
sometimes
change
their
mind.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
adequate
for
the
government
to
present
the
affidavits
of
the
six
people,
indicating
that
they
had
committed
a
crime.
this
is
certainly
reliable
information.
after
all
a
--
people
don’t
ordinarily
put
their
--
subject
themselves
to
punishment
or
to
loss
of
jobs
by
admitting
they
have
committed
an
offense.
and
so
the
grand
jury
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
had
very
reliable
evidence
and
they
had
sufficient
evidence
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
i
didn’t
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i
don’t
suggest
that
we
were
tried
--
the
department
of
justice
would
try
to
stop
the
grand
jury
from
hearing
hearsay
evidence.
i
just
suggest
that
the
department
of
justice
when
they
assist
a
grand
jury
would
find
it
prudent
in
view
of
criticism
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
offer
firsthand
testimony.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
the
law
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
i
don't
think
the
law
is
the
other
way.
i
think
the
law
is
that
a
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
act
on
its
own.
i
think
the
grand
jury
has
the
right
to
act
on
its
own,
and
if
the
grand
jury
can
hear
any
type
of
evidence
that
it
wants.
all
i’m
suggesting
is
if
the
court
of
appeals
like
the
second
circuit
is
done
in
this
case
has
said
that
where
practical
the
u.s.
attorney
should
offer
the
grand
jury
first
hand
evidence.
i
say
it’s
prudent
for
the
u.s.
attorney
to
do
this
because
if
you’re
going
to
--
why
get
yourself
involved
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
trial
long
involved
lawsuit,
and
at
the
very
tail
end,
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
say
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
grand
jury
procedure.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
though
i
think
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
the
right
may
--
i
think
the
suggestion
may
have
come
from
a
case,
an
earlier
case
which
they
had
where
there
was
a
dispute
between,
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
there
had
been
a
witness
--
an
agent
who
testified
they
had
deceived
the
grand
jury.
and
in
order
--
and
i
think
it
was
in
response
and
that
was
in
the
payton
case
and
it
was
a
two
to
one
decision
on
the
second
circuit.
and
now
i
think
in
this
case
–
because
this
case
followed
that
up,
and
i
think
what
they
wanted
to
do
is
avoid
a
situation
where
somebody
could
say
the
agent
who’s
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
agent
testified
before
the
grand
jury
indicated
the
grand
jury
had
personal
knowledge
with
certain
fact
when
he
didn’t.
and
the
court
--
i
think
that
was
the
response
of
the
--
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
it.
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
let
me
get
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case.
the
jencks
act
or
statute
provides
that
after
a
witness
testifies
on
direct
examination,
upon
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
government
shall
turn
over
all
statements
of
the
witness
which
relates
to
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
the
witness
has
testified.
and
if
material
doesn’t
relate
to
the
subject
matter,
the
court
shall
examine
the
statement
in-camera
and
shall
excise
the
portion
of
the
statements
which
do
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
testimony.
now
in
this
particular
case,
the
court,
the
trial
judge
we
believe
did
turn
over
the
material
which
should
have
been
turned
over
and
the
material
which
was
not
turned
over
was
properly
kept
from
the
defendant.
now
the
trial
judge
in
determining
what
related
in
this
to
the
subject
matter
upon
which
the
witness
has
testified
didn’t
adopt
any
narrow
rule.
he
gave
them
--
the
defense
got
the
affidavits
which
concerned
the
activities
to
which
witnesses
testified
on
direct
examination.
in
addition,
the
defense
obtained
earlier
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
witnesses
even
though
only
one
of
the
witnesses
as
mentioned
petitioner,
and
even
as
to
the
statements.
even
statements
which
didn’t
mention
petitioner
in
two
instances
were
turned
over
to
petitioner
and
these
statements
mentioned
acts
of
other
accountants.
the
full
record
and
not
just
the
printed
appendix
in
this
case
shows
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
--
initially
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
third
witness,
a
former
employee
named
diche
(ph)
was
not
turned
over.
the
court
after
reading
the
exhibit
noticed
a
question
in
this
grand
jury’s
act
testimony
which
said
“did
anybody
else
give
you
any
money?”
and
the
witness
at
that
time
didn’t
name
umans.
the
court
said
“this
material
should
be
turned
over.”
and
what
the
court
says
“at
least
the
defendant
could
argue
that
at
that
particular
time
in
the
grand
jury,
the
witness
either
did
not
remember
or
could
not
remember
or
did
not
want
to
remember
umans’
name.”
so
we
have
a
situation
where
what
the
court
was
trying
to
do
was,
was
trying
to
turn
over
--
is
turning
over
any
material
which
related
to
umans
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
from
disclosure
a
material
which
related
to
other
accountants
individuals
who
hadn’t
been
--
who
had
been
indicted
and
which
were
--
and
who
were
awaiting
trial.
now
the
issue
thus,
is
whether
this
peripheral
matter
has
to
be
turned
over.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
court
has
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
court
has
discretion
at
trial
to
cut
off
all
examination
as
to
other
acts
of
bribery.
the
court
doesn’t
have
to
allow
a
defense
counsel
to
get
into
the
--
to
allow
him
to
cross-examine
upon
--
and
try
to
impeach
a
witness
with
other
acts
of
misconduct
not
amounting
to
criminal
conviction.
but
here
the
court,
the
court
did
allow
this
--
did
allow
these
witnesses
to
be
examined
concerning
these
other
bribes,
but
what
the
court
didn’t
turn
over
and
properly
didn’t
turn
over
was
the
particulars.
in
other
words,
he
didn’t
turn
over
the
defense's
statements
which
said
that
on
a
particular
day
involving
a
particular
tax
return,
the
particular
accountant
who
may
have
been
awaiting
trial
on
a
separate
indictment
paid
the
agent
a
particular
sum
of
money.
we
don’t
think
that
--
we
think
the
jencks
act
--
this
is
a
type
of
a
material
which
the
jencks
act
meant
to
keep
confidential,
especially
since
it
involves
what
we
say
is
needless
disclosure
of
other
people.
petitioner’s
cross-examination
wasn’t
hampered.
he
was
allowed
to
question
each
of
the
witnesses
as
to
the
various
amounts
of
money
they
received
from
other
people.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
yes
that’s
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
in
addition
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
the
–
no,
at
the
trial.
no,
the
trial
turned
over
grand
jury
testimony
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
sure
we
agree
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
that’s
right
and
that’s
what
the
court,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
portion
of
the
transcript
it’s
in
page
162
and
163
of
the
original
transcript,
it
isn’t
printed,
the
court
did
when
he
noticed
that
one
of
these
documents
did
name
either
accountants,
he
did
turn
over
that
type
of
material,
and
also
that
there
are
two
other
affidavits
which
name
other
accountants,
don’t
name
petitioner
one
as
exhibit
107
involving
the
witness
ellington,
the
other
one
is
128
(a)
involving
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
for
some
reason
the
witness
ellington
was
not
cross-examined
except
with
his
grand
jury
testimony
just
for
two
pages.
the
witness
ryan
was
cross-examined
extensively
not
only
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
he
had
that
material.
now
how
much
use
he
made
of
it,
he
--
i
don’t
recall,
but
he
had
it
and
i
think
what
he
did
is
he
may
had
it
marked
as
a
defense
exhibit
and
it
was
given
to
the
jury.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
would
have
i
–
in
first
place
i
can’t
conceive
of
a
prosecutor
doing
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
would
say
if
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence,
no
evidence,
i
would
have
trouble
with
the
case.
i
would
think
that’s
--
you
could
find
some
sort
of
abuse,
maybe
the
government,
this
is
overreaching
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
should
give
the
grand
jury
something.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
the
--
that
the
--
i
have
no
objection
to
--
in
this
case
there
is
a
probable
cause.
i
have
--
with
the
problem
i
have
in
the
case
it
seems
to
me
that
i
don’t
see
the
real
need
for
putting
an
intervening
step
with
--
in
this
type
of
situation.
i
think
as
long
as
there
is
some
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
should
be
sufficient,
because
unlike
the
motion
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
--
well
of
course,
if
there’s
--
and
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
any
evidence,
if
there’s
any
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
should
be
sufficient,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
no
evidence
--
if
there’s
absolutely
--
if
there’s
an
absolutely
no
evidence
in
that
particular
situation
that’s
where
i’d
say
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there
have
to
be
some
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
there’s
absolutely
no
evidence,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
there’s
some
evidence
and
especially
in
a
case
--
and
of
course
in
this
case,
i
think
there’s
clear
evidence
of
probable
cause.
i
don’t
think
that
requires
an
examination
by
the
court.
but
my
problem
with
the
no
evidence
situation
is
if
the
grand
jury
on
its
own
would
go
ahead
and
indict
and
it
was
an
unbiased
grand
jury
and
did
it
on
the
basis
of
its
own
knowledge,
i
would
say
it’s
a
valid
indictment.
where
i
have
trouble
is
the
situation
where
the
u.s.
attorney
knowing,
with
knowledge
of
the
law
has
some
evidence,
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
has
a
duty
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
and
not
just
say
indict
so
and
so.
that’s
why
it’s
a
--
in
connection
with
the
no
evidence
case,
i
think
that
may
not
be
--
that
is
basically
a
problem
where
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
has
sort
of
overreached
or
perhaps
deceived
the
grand
jury.
i
don’t
think
the
u.s.
attorney
should
do
that.
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
should
try
to
give
some
evidence
to
grand
jury.
however,
i
think
the
grand
jury
on
its
own
decides
to
indict
somebody
on
its
own
knowledge,
and
i
think
it’s
a
valid
indictment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
of
course
that
indictment
will
only
be
valid
as
i
understand
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
cox
case
which
requires
its
u.s.
attorney
to
sign
the
indictment.
i
can’t
conceive
of
the
u.s.
attorney
signing
an
indictment
in
that
situation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
was
the
dispute
in
this
case
--
in
the
case
involving
down
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
my
recollection
is
when
that
case
went
up
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
--
it
had
said
they
couldn’t
proceed
with
the
trial,
that
the
indictment
required
a
signature
of
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
you’re
faced
unless
you’re
going
through
the
change
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
traditional
notion
of
the
grand
jury
was
that
the
grand
jury
could
act
on
its
own
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
sure.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct.
it’s
a
rare
grand
jury
where
it’ll
act
on
its
own,
but
if
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
correct.
i
think
there’s
a
protection
which
we
can
overlook
in
the
fact
that
it’s
not
one
of
the
grand
juries,
not
one
person.
the
grand
jury
takes
12
people
and
the
grand
jury
doesn’t
sit
permanently.
you
have
a
constant
change
over
in
grand
juries,
so
you
don’t
have
a
situation
where
you
have
an
arbitrary
elected
official
who
might
be
doing
something.
here’s
a
grand
jury
which
been
sitting
for
a
short
span
of
time
then
it
takes
12
people
have
to
go
haywire
and
not
just
one,
and
to
have
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
not
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that’s
often
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
but
as
we
point
out
in
that
brief,
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
abuse
from
this
situation
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
one
of
the
state
that
i’m
very
familiar
with
missouri
is
an
alternative.
the
prosecutor
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
an
alternative
in
every
case.
he
can
either
proceed
by
information.
if
he
proceeds
by
information
then
the
defendants
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
if
he
proceeds
by
information,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
preliminary
hearing,
or
if
he
proceeds
by
indictment,
the
indictment
eliminates
preliminary
hearing.
in
other
words,
he
has
an
alternative,
but
in
the
--
as
to
a
state
where
the
prosecutor
just
has
the
right,
you
know,
going
in
a
case
by
information,
i’m
not
sure
whether
the
procedure
would
require
a
preliminary
hearing
or
not
or
whether
the
--
just
the
oath
of
the
prosecutor
would
be
sufficient
and
would
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
provide.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i’m
sure
that’s
a
practice
and
i
--
it’s
the
english
practice
as
i
understand
it
now
also
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
don’t
know
what
the
rule
is.
i
just
know
that
in
one
state,
the
rule
is
when
they
proceed
by
information
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing.
now
whether
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
where
there
is
probable
cause,
probable
cause
is
the
issue.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
correct,
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i’m
not
--
i
just
know
the
--
i
think
the
english
