justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
any
knowledge
mr.
brodsky
whether
this
is
a
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
or
is
this
something
developed
by
the
united
states
attorneys
in
their
respect
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brodsky,
was
there
any
arraignment
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
nature
of
the
government’s
case
to
hold
them
over
for
grand
jury
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
preliminary
hearing
i
guess
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
this
--
what
happens
to
the
preliminary
hearings,
are
they
--
would’ve
they
simply
decide
whether
they
hold
over
for
the
grand
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
is
the
standard
that’s
followed
before
the
united
states
commission
in
those
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
there
had
been
one
here,
with
what
was
presented
to
this
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
indictment
had
been
sufficient
to
commit
--
united
states
commission
to
hold
a
motive
for
grand
jury
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
if
he’d
read
the
affidavits
than
were
a
difficult
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
swore
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there’s
a
transcript
of
this
particular
grand
jury
proceeding
anywhere
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
try
to
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
hasn’t
the
second
circuit
mr.
brodsky
been
rather
more
liberal
perhaps
in
other
circuits
about
making
minutes
of
grand
jury
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
sorry
mr.
glazer;
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it’s
the
justice
department?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
with
any
justice
department
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
the
record
wouldn’t
show
anything
about
this
but
how
often
was,
before
this
case,
was
the
practice
followed
which
was
followed
in
this
case,
do
you
know
that?
is
that
a
common
place
thing
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
the
southern
district
we’re
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
southern
district
is
now
following
the
admonition
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
i
take
it
the
department
of
justice
could,
i
imagine,
administratively
establish
a
policy
which
would
be
binding
on
all
u.s.
attorneys
i
suspect,
couldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
indication
that
it
has
any
idea
doing
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
suggest
i
should
think
a
more
practical
way
would
be
for
the
department
of
justice
to
announce
a
policy
in
this
regard
and
bind
the
u.s.
attorneys
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
glazer,
were
any
of
the
papers
turned
over
to
the
defense,
affidavits
or
other
statements
of
the
witnesses
in
which
they
identified
receipts
of
money
from
other
than
this
petitioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there
were
some
documents
in
which
omissions
of
the
petitioner’s
name
as
one
who
paid
the
money
appears,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
agree
or
do
you
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
a
document
in
which
a
name
was
omitted
that
there
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
any
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses
based
on
the
omission
of
petitioners
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
the
omission
of
petitioner’s
name
from
his
prior
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
glazer,
may
i
just
ask
you
before
you
sit
down,
i
gather
this,
the
probable
cause
standard
is
the
standard
that
staged
a
preliminary
hearing
to
bind
over
to
the
grand
jury,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
it’s
still
true,
it
used
to
be
when
i
was
in
the
practice
that
it’s
not
often
that
the
grand
jury
goes
off
on
its
own?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily
the
grand
jury
receives
only
that
which
the
prosecutor
presents,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
this
case,
it
doesn’t
really
involve
an
issue
of
what
would
be
the
case
if
the
grand
jury
went
off
on
its
own?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
we’re
really
concerned
with
what
should
be
the
case
when
the
government,
u.s.
attorney,
comes
before
the
grand
jury
just
as
it
would
be
the
u.s.
attorney
who
would
come
before
the
commissioner
in
preliminary
hearing,
isn’t
it?
why
should
we
have
any
different
test
over
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well
i’d
like
to
lay
that
aside
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
just
wondering
where,
whereas
i
think
is
usually
the
case,
the
grand
jury
never
thinks
of
doing
anything
unless
and
as
the
u.s.
attorney,
i
know
they’re
exception,
but
unless
and
as
the
u.s.
attorney
comes
in
and
produces
witnesses
and
suggests
that
this
is
an
indictable
offense.
i
don’t
think
grand
juries
ordinarily
act,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
isn’t
any
doubt
that
grand
juries
often
will
refuse
to
indict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however
persuasive
the
u.s.
attorney
may
be
that
this
is
an
indictable
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
