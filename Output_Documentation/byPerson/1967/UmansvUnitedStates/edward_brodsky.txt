mr.
edward
brodsky
if
the
court
please.
petitioner
is
a
certified
public
accountant
who
was
convicted
in
the
court
below
of
giving
money
to
internal
revenue
service
agents.
he
was
named
in
24
counts
of
an
indictment
for
12
separate
transactions
with
respect
to
each
transaction
there
were
two
separate
counts
in
the
indictment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
three
of
the
counts
of
the
indictments
so
there
were
21
counts
remaining.
the
evidence
very
briefly
consisted
of
testimony
from
seven
internal
revenue
service
agents
who
testified
generally
that
they
received
money
from
the
petitioner
in
connection
with
their
audit
of
various
tax
returns.
the
amount
of
money
that
they
received
varied
from
a
low
of
$25.00
according
to
them
to
a
high
of
$75.00
most
of
the
payments
were
$50.00.
with
that
very
brief
statement
of
the
facts,
because
we’re
not
complaining
that
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
was
insufficient,
i
will
go
immediately
to
my
first
point
which
is
that
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
was
insufficient
to
support
the
indictment.
now
the
entire
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
consisted
according
to
the
government’s
characterization
of
an
internal
revenue
service
agent’s
brief
summary
of
portions
of
affidavits
relating
to
the
alleged
illegal
payments
made
by
petitioner.
the
man
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
i
don’t
know
who
he
was,
but
from
the
record
in
this
case
he
could
not
have
had
any
personal
knowledge
about
more
than
just
a
few
of
these
affidavits.
in
other
words,
the
government
puts
a
man
before
the
grand
jury
who
has
no
personal
knowledge
of
most,
if
not
all,
of
these
pieces
of
paper
that
he’s
summarizing,
and
then
he
briefly
summarizes
this
hearsay,
and
that
is
the
entire
testimony
to
support
this
indictment.
now
the
grand
jury
testimony
itself
is
not
a
part
of
the
record.
i
know
what
it
was
because
the
government
stated
what
it
was
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
this
is
what
the
grand
jury
testimony
was.
now,
i
am
arguing
here
that
that
evidence
was
insufficient
on
alternative
grounds,
either
under
petitioner’s
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury,
i
think
that
right
includes
some
kind
of
substance
behind
the
grand
jury
indictment,
or
if
this
case
does
not
reach
constitutional
dimensions
then
i
would
ask
this
court
under
its
rule
making
power
to
so
hold.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
two
hurdles
to
overcome
in
this
court.
first,
i
must
convince
the
court
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
standard
of
evidence
in
these
grand
jury
situations,
a
standard
of
evidence
which
is
enforceable
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts.
second,
once
i
get
beyond
that
hurdle,
the
question
becomes
what
should
that
standard
of
evidence
be.
addressing
myself
to
the
first
question,
i
think
that
the
analysis
can
be
made
in
this
way.
surely,
i
would
think
that
everyone
would
agree
that
if
an
indictment
is
based
upon
no
evidence,
if
for
an
example
the
prosecutor
walks
into
the
grand
jury
and
says
“ladies
and
gentlemen,
john
doe
committed
a
crime,
return
an
indictment.”
and
it
does
inconceivably
it
could.
i
think
that
all
would
agree
that
such
an
indictment
would
not
be
supported
by
this
or
any
other
court.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
not
at
all.
i’m
just
trying
to
make
an
analysis
now.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
the
costello
case
in
this
court
certainly
says
that.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
edward
brodsky
before
costello,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
brodsky
there’s
no
decision
after
costello
which
would
sustain
what
i
said.
and
i
think
to
be
perfectly
frank
that
what
i’m
asking
this
court
to
do
is
not
to
overrule
costello
because
i
think
this
case
is
far
distinguishable
from
costello,
but
at
least
to
change
some
of
the
broad
sweeping
language
in
costello.
costello
says
that
if
an
indictment
is
valid
on
its
face,
and
if
it
was
returned
by
a
legally
constituted
grand
jury
that’s
enough.
and
i’m
saying
that
that
is
not
enough
under
many
circumstances
and
particularly
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
what’s
happened
since
costello,
i
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
my
brief
where
this
has
happened,
is
that
prosecutors
had
been
reading
costello
in
its
broadest
sense
and
have
been
returning
indictments
based
upon
less
and
less
evidence.
and
i
think
that,
and
i
charge
in
my
brief,
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
they’re
doing
this
is
because
when
they
don’t
put
a
person
with
personal
knowledge
before
the
grand
jury
then
they
don’t
create
another
record
by
a
person
who
is
going
to
testify
a
trial,
a
record
which
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
defense
counsel.
so
that
prosecutors
are
motivated
to
get
further
and
further
away
from
presenting
to
grand
juries
any
evidence
which
is
based
upon
personal
knowledge.
and
the
further
away
from
that
which
you
get,
the
closer
you
get
to
a
situation
of
no
evidence
at
all,
and
i
think
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
all
of
them
did
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
obtained
portions
of
their
affidavits
and
the
solicitor
general
says
and
i
have
no
reason
to
dispute
it
that
the
affidavits
which
they
gave
us
at
trial
are
the
very
same
affidavits
which
were
summarized
before
the
grand
jury,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
did
indeed.
we
would’ve
obtained
that
your
honor
under
the
jencks
act
in
any
event.
i
think
what
the
government
avoids
here
if
they
would’ve
had
these
same
witnesses
testify
before
this
grand
jury,
we
would’ve
had
not
only
their
jencks
act
statements,
these
affidavits
that
were
summarized,
but
in
addition
their
grand
jury
testimony
which
might
have
been
inconsistent
with
their
jencks
act
statements.
i’d
like
to
pursue
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
doubt
that
for
this
reason.
these
very
same
persons
testified
before
a
previous
grand
jury
in
this
case
and
six
out
of
seven
of
them,
when
they
were
asked
in
substance
to
name
the
persons
from
whom
they
received
money,
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
they
did,
when
the
prosecutor
said
“are
there
other
people
from
whom
you
have
taken
money
whose
names
you
don’t
remember?”
they
said
“yes.”
but
when
they
were
asked
this
specific
question
“tell
me
the
names
of
those
persons
from
whom
you
received
money,”
six
out
of
seven
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
now
when
they
come
to
get
an
indictment
against
petitioner,
instead
of
using
the
same
grand
jury
which
knew
about
these
prior,
what
i
would
call
inconsistent
statements,
they
go
to
a
new
grand
jury
and
they
don’t
tell
the
new
grand
jury
that
these
people
have
previously
testified
and
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
they
merely
have
an
agent
who
is
isolated,
from
firsthand
testimony,
summarize
these
affidavits.
and
i
think
that’s
very
far
away
from
any
kind
of
substantive
evidence.
i
should
say
also
that
the
scope
of
this
problem
is
indicated
by
a
letter
which
is
annexed
to
the
government’s
brief,
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
the
solicitor
general,
where
the
united
states
attorney
says,
in
answer
to
my
charge
that
in
most
cases,
indictments
are
being
returned
on
less
and
less
evidence,
he
says
himself
that
his
policy
has
been
up
until
this
very
case
in
the,
and
this
is
his
language,
in
the
so
called
cut
and
dried
cases
to
have
an
agent
summarize
his
interviews
or
his
investigations
of
the
case,
mostly
his
interviews
in
the
cases
the
way
the
united
states
attorney
puts
it.
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
united
states
attorneys
throughout
the
country,
unless
the
law
is
changed,
unless
this
court
says
something
about
it
to
make
a
change,
the
united
states
attorneys
in
this
country
have
the
discretion
now
to
present
second
or
third
or
fifth
or
sixth
hand
evidence
to
grand
juries.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
knowledge
on
that
one
way
or
another
your
honor.
the
only
information
is
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
department
of
justice
does
not
say
in
this
record
any
place
what
their
policy
is
throughout
country.
now
assuming
for
a
moment
that,
and
i
might
say
this
before
i
get
to
the
next
point,
that
if
the
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case
is
upheld
by
this
court
and
this
indictment
is
sustained,
then
this
is
an
effect
a
notification
to
the
united
states
attorneys
across
the
country
that
this
kind
of
flimsy
evidence
at
least
will
be
sustained
and
there’s
no
reason,
there’s
no
motivation
on
their
part
to
present
any
stronger
evidence,
and
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned
as
a
practical
matter,
when
a
prosecutor
says
to
the
grand
jury
after
summarizing
affidavits,
well
if
the
grand
jury
does
say
“shouldn’t
we
have
something
more?”
when
he
says
to
the
grand
jury
“well
you
know
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
sustained
this
procedure,”
that
i
believe
would
be
sufficient
for
most
grand
jurors
not
to
probe
any
further.
now
assuming
for
a
moment
that
i’m
over
the
first
hurdle
and
that
or
might
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
standard
that
i
get
to
the
next
question
which
is
what
should
that
standard
be.
and
i’m
arguing
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
standard
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
should
at
the
very
least
be
the
same
standard
of
evidence
as
one
needs
to
get
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
anomalous
that
you
can
indict
a
person
on
something
less
than
you
can
arrest
a
person
on.
after
all
the
consequences
of
an
indictment,
the
humiliation
to
say
nothing
of
the
expense
of
going
through
a
complicated
or
even
a
non-complicated
trial.
a
much
more
severe
when
a
person
is
indicted
then
when
he’s
arrested
yet
as
this
very
case
shows
a
person
can
be
indicted
on
substantially
less
evidence
than
a
person
can
be
arrested.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
i
address
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
try
to
address
myself
to
that
question
in
the
brief
and
i
ask
this
court
to
look
out
for
reference
to
what’s
done
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
constitutional
language
is
almost
identical
to
the
federal
constitution
on
this
point
and
my
interpretation
in
that
state
and
by
statute
only
legal
evidence,
what
they
call
legal
evidence
can
be
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
and
they
go
this
far,
and
i’m
not
arguing
that
this
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
this
case,
in
new
york
they
say
that
you
must
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
as
you
would
at
trial
before
the
grand
jury.
now
addressing
myself
to
that
question,
don’t
you
need
a
hearing
in
every
case,
the
answer
in
new
york
has
been
no.
a
person
must
first
establish
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
there
may
indeed
be
insufficient
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
you
don’t
automatically
get
a
hearing
just
because
you
ask
for
it.
it
might
be
similar
to
an
illegal
search
question
where
the
question
is
“was
there
an
illegal
trespass
by
federal
agents?”
a
person
must
first
make
a
showing
of
some
kind
of
evidence
that
there
was
indeed
an
illegal
trespass
before
he’s
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
i
think
it’s
both.
i
think
its
more
reliability
than
quantum
of
evidence.
i
don’t
suggest
to
mean
quantum
of
evidence.
i
don’t
understand
probable
cause
in
arrest
or
search
warrant
cases
to
mean
quantum
of
evidence.
i
understand
it
to
be
reliability,
and
i’m
arguing
reliability
here
too,
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
that
would’ve
been
clearly
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no
it’s
about
three
times
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes,
there
was
an
arraignment.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
there
was
an
arraignment
after
the
grand
jury
an
indictment,
excuse
me.
mr.
edward
brodsky
not
before,
no
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no
there
was
not,
no
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
what
would’ve
happened
in
this
case
your
honor?
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
believe
its
probable
cause,
the
same
standard
as
is
necessary
for
arrest
or
search.
i
believe
that’s
the
same
one.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
because
there
was
no
probable
cause.
i
think
the
standard
there
is
the
same
standard
of
probable
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
not
necessarily
your
honor,
i
think
for
example
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
no,
the
fact
that
i
was
summary
of
an
affidavit
instead
of
a
person.
for
example,
i
think
that
if
an
agent
in
this
case
had
interviewed
all
seven
of
these
people
and
had
then
gone
to
the
commissioner
and
said
“commissioner,
i
have
spoken
to
these
seven
people.
each
of
them
told
me
that
petitioner
gave
them
money
in
connection
with
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
i’d
be
making
the
same
argument
would
not
be
as
strong
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
much
stronger
case
because
he
summarized
these
affidavits.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
so.
at
least
he
would
have
been
given
word
for
word
to
the
grand
jury
what
these
people
actually
said,
this
would
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
and
swore
to.
i
go
further
because
this
agent
didn’t
even
know
that
these
pieces
of
paper
were
in
fact
affidavits.
these
pieces
of
paper
i
would
assume
what
happened,
i
think
the
record
supports
this,
one
agent
gathered
the
affidavits.
they
were
sworn
before
many
different
agents,
some
10
or
12
or
more
agents
and
one
agent
took
them
all.
he
may
have
had
personal
knowledge
because
maybe
one
or
two
of
these
people
swore
to
these
affidavits
before
the
agent,
but
he
didn’t
have
any
knowledge.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
were
sworn
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
were
in
form
of
affidavits,
no
question
about
that,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
go
to
my
second
point
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
idea,
i
don’t
know
what
his
name
was,
i
don’t
know
what
his
capacity
is.
the
government
does
not
reveal
that
and
it’s
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
do
not
know
that
your
honor
from
this
record
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
would
think
he
did,
yes,
but
without
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
do
not
know
that
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
even
if
you
were
if
it’s
not
part
of
the
record
before
the
grand
jury,
i
make
an
analogy
to
the
arresting
officer
who
has
a
great
deal
of
information
in
his
head
that
he
doesn’t
put
into
an
affidavit.
this
court
has
held
that
you
look
to
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit.
i’m
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
you
look
to
the
four
corners
of
the
foundation
for
the
indictment.
mr.
edward
brodsky
sorry
i
didn’t
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
you
don’t
call
grand
jurors.
i
--
certainly
i
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
all
proceedings
are
transcribed.
i
think
this
is
the
practice
generally
throughout
the
country.
mr.
edward
brodsky
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
we
did.
we
asked
for
it
but
it
was
denied.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
no,
what
you
would
do,
yes.
assuming
that
we
can
make
a
showing
as
we
did
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial
testified
before
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
petitioner.
now
that
leads
to
the
question,
well
what
was
the
evidence,
and
we
bring
to
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
we
say
to
the
court
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
of
the
trial
court,
oh
yes!
and
we
said,
please
direct
the
government
to
furnish
you
with
a
copy
of
the
minutes
before
the
grand
jury,
or
furnish
them
to
us
so
that
we
can
look
at
them
and
brief
and
argue
the
point,
assuming
that
there
is
a
point
after
you
look
at
them.
so
there
wouldn’t
be
any
calling
of
grand
jurors
or
calling
of
witnesses
who
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edward
brodsky
at
least
to
the
court.
it
could
be
in-camera.
mr.
edward
brodsky
--
in
the
first
instance,
that’s
the
way
they
do
it
in
new
york.
again
i
refer
to
that,
because
in
the
first
instance
the
judge
himself
takes
a
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
then
if
the
point,
as
they
put
it,
is
fairly
arguable
then
they
give
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
defense
counsel
for
brief
and
argument.
mr.
edward
brodsky
it
did
most
assuredly
does
in
that
sense.
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
problem
we
invade
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
very
often.
we
get
the
minutes
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
when
they
testify
at
trial.
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
said
that
under
some
circumstances
we’re
entitled
to
the
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
have
indeed.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
have
indeed,
during
the
pro
tanto.
i
would
like
to
get
to
my
jencks
act
point
in
the
time
remaining.
after
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
they
were,
counsel
asked
the
government
to
produce
all
of
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
which
came
within
the
jencks
statute.
now
there
are
a
large
number
of
statements
which
were
not
furnished
to
us,
which
were
sealed
in
the
court
below,
sent
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
understand
that
they
are
still
sealed
and
now
they
are
lodged
with
this
court.
now
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
these
statements
are
statements
by
these
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial
in
which
they
admit
the
receipt
of
money
from
other
people,
not
from
petitioner,
and
therefore
the
government
has
said
that
does
not
relate
to
their
direct
testimony
since
they
didn’t
testify
about
other
people
on
direct
testimony
and
that
therefore
the
statements
do
not
fall
within
the
jencks
statute.
i
want
to
put
the
jencks
act
in
what
i
think
it’s
it
proper
context
before
i
argue
how
these
statements
do
indeed
relate
to
the
direct
testimony.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
the
jencks
act
in
terms
of
the
rosenberg
case
in
this
court
in
which
this
court
said
that
jencks
should
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
its
purpose
which
is
to
provide
defense
counsel
with
material
which
might
be
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
so
trying
to
answer
that
question,
was
this
material
useful
for
impeachment
purposes,
of
course
i
haven’t
seen
it,
but
knowing
what
it
is
from
the
statement
in
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
that
it
was
indeed
valuable
for
impeachment
purposes
in
this
way.
the
witnesses
apparently
gave
a
lot
of
affidavits
to
the
government
in
which
they
fail
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
now
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
useful
for
us
at
trial
to
be
able
to
show
that,
for
example,
on
january
1,
on
january
15,
on
january
20,
and
that’s
the
way
it
is
in
this
case.
i’m
referring
to
dates
with
respect
to
one
of
the
particular
witnesses,
on
each
of
those
dates,
the
witness
filled
out
an
affidavit
in
which
he
purported
to
name,
the
names
of
those
people
from
whom
he
received
money
and
he
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name
on
each
of
those
dates.
and
it
wasn’t
until
for
example
april
17
in
the
particular
case
that
i’m
talking
about,
that
he
first
mentioned
petitioner’s
name.
now
i
think
that
would’ve
been
extremely
useful
for
cross
examination
purposes
and
we
were
denied
that
in
the
court
below.
in
addition,
i
think
that
there
was
another
value
for
impeachment
purposes
here
and
that
is
this.
in
the
statements,
the
witnesses
admitted
taking
money
from
other
people.
they
admitted
in
effect
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
i
think
that
on
cross-examination,
it
would’ve
been
useful
and
valuable
for
impeachment
purposes
to
be
able
to
show
each
specific
crime
that
these
witnesses
admitted
in
the
affidavits
which
were
denied
to
us.
now
the
government
claims
with
regard
to
this
point
that
we
did
on
cross-examination
asked
these
witnesses
whether
or
not
they
received
money
from
other
people
aside
from
petitioner,
and
indeed
we
did.
but
the
record
shows
that
in
answer
to
our
questions
on
cross-examination,
the
witnesses
were
somewhat
vague.
they
said
“well,
yes
i
took
money,
but
i
don’t
remember
how
many
people
that
i
took
money
from
or
the
years
or
the
amounts”
and
yet
when
they
were
filling
out
these
affidavits
in
the
privacy
of
their
rooms
with
the
government
officials,
they
were
quite
precise
i
am
sure
these
affidavits
will
show.
they
were
quite
precise
in
saying
“on
july
5,
1965,
i
took
$25.00
from
john
doe”
and
i
think
that
these
statements
would’ve
been
extremely
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
because
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy,
what
we
might
have
been
able
to
argue
to
the
jury
was
that
these
people
were
actually
memorizing
what
they
said
in
this
case.
and
indeed
filling
out
precise
affidavits
and
only
by
minimizing
these
affidavits
could
they
remember
what
their
actual
testimony
was.
they
really
couldn’t
remember
it
unless
they
were
sitting
down
with
government
agents
and
writing
with
government
agents
precisely
what
they
were
recreating
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
brodsky
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
nothing
further
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
if
the
court
please.
petitioner
is
a
certified
public
accountant
who
was
convicted
in
the
court
below
of
giving
money
to
internal
revenue
service
agents.
he
was
named
in
24
counts
of
an
indictment
for
12
separate
transactions
with
respect
to
each
transaction
there
were
two
separate
counts
in
the
indictment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
three
of
the
counts
of
the
indictments
so
there
were
21
counts
remaining.
the
evidence
very
briefly
consisted
of
testimony
from
seven
internal
revenue
service
agents
who
testified
generally
that
they
received
money
from
the
petitioner
in
connection
with
their
audit
of
various
tax
returns.
the
amount
of
money
that
they
received
varied
from
a
low
of
$25.00
according
to
them
to
a
high
of
$75.00
most
of
the
payments
were
$50.00.
with
that
very
brief
statement
of
the
facts,
because
we’re
not
complaining
that
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
was
insufficient,
i
will
go
immediately
to
my
first
point
which
is
that
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
was
insufficient
to
support
the
indictment.
now
the
entire
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
consisted
according
to
the
government’s
characterization
of
an
internal
revenue
service
agent’s
brief
summary
of
portions
of
affidavits
relating
to
the
alleged
illegal
payments
made
by
petitioner.
the
man
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
i
don’t
know
who
he
was,
but
from
the
record
in
this
case
he
could
not
have
had
any
personal
knowledge
about
more
than
just
a
few
of
these
affidavits.
in
other
words,
the
government
puts
a
man
before
the
grand
jury
who
has
no
personal
knowledge
of
most,
if
not
all,
of
these
pieces
of
paper
that
he’s
summarizing,
and
then
he
briefly
summarizes
this
hearsay,
and
that
is
the
entire
testimony
to
support
this
indictment.
now
the
grand
jury
testimony
itself
is
not
a
part
of
the
record.
i
know
what
it
was
because
the
government
stated
what
it
was
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
this
is
what
the
grand
jury
testimony
was.
now,
i
am
arguing
here
that
that
evidence
was
insufficient
on
alternative
grounds,
either
under
petitioner’s
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury,
i
think
that
right
includes
some
kind
of
substance
behind
the
grand
jury
indictment,
or
if
this
case
does
not
reach
constitutional
dimensions
then
i
would
ask
this
court
under
its
rule
making
power
to
so
hold.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
two
hurdles
to
overcome
in
this
court.
first,
i
must
convince
the
court
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
standard
of
evidence
in
these
grand
jury
situations,
a
standard
of
evidence
which
is
enforceable
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts.
second,
once
i
get
beyond
that
hurdle,
the
question
becomes
what
should
that
standard
of
evidence
be.
addressing
myself
to
the
first
question,
i
think
that
the
analysis
can
be
made
in
this
way.
surely,
i
would
think
that
everyone
would
agree
that
if
an
indictment
is
based
upon
no
evidence,
if
for
an
example
the
prosecutor
walks
into
the
grand
jury
and
says
“ladies
and
gentlemen,
john
doe
committed
a
crime,
return
an
indictment.”
and
it
does
inconceivably
it
could.
i
think
that
all
would
agree
that
such
an
indictment
would
not
be
supported
by
this
or
any
other
court.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
not
at
all.
i’m
just
trying
to
make
an
analysis
now.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
the
costello
case
in
this
court
certainly
says
that.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
edward
brodsky
before
costello,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
brodsky
there’s
no
decision
after
costello
which
would
sustain
what
i
said.
and
i
think
to
be
perfectly
frank
that
what
i’m
asking
this
court
to
do
is
not
to
overrule
costello
because
i
think
this
case
is
far
distinguishable
from
costello,
but
at
least
to
change
some
of
the
broad
sweeping
language
in
costello.
costello
says
that
if
an
indictment
is
valid
on
its
face,
and
if
it
was
returned
by
a
legally
constituted
grand
jury
that’s
enough.
and
i’m
saying
that
that
is
not
enough
under
many
circumstances
and
particularly
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
what’s
happened
since
costello,
i
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
my
brief
where
this
has
happened,
is
that
prosecutors
had
been
reading
costello
in
its
broadest
sense
and
have
been
returning
indictments
based
upon
less
and
less
evidence.
and
i
think
that,
and
i
charge
in
my
brief,
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
they’re
doing
this
is
because
when
they
don’t
put
a
person
with
personal
knowledge
before
the
grand
jury
then
they
don’t
create
another
record
by
a
person
who
is
going
to
testify
a
trial,
a
record
which
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
defense
counsel.
so
that
prosecutors
are
motivated
to
get
further
and
further
away
from
presenting
to
grand
juries
any
evidence
which
is
based
upon
personal
knowledge.
and
the
further
away
from
that
which
you
get,
the
closer
you
get
to
a
situation
of
no
evidence
at
all,
and
i
think
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
all
of
them
did
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
obtained
portions
of
their
affidavits
and
the
solicitor
general
says
and
i
have
no
reason
to
dispute
it
that
the
affidavits
which
they
gave
us
at
trial
are
the
very
same
affidavits
which
were
summarized
before
the
grand
jury,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
did
indeed.
we
would’ve
obtained
that
your
honor
under
the
jencks
act
in
any
event.
i
think
what
the
government
avoids
here
if
they
would’ve
had
these
same
witnesses
testify
before
this
grand
jury,
we
would’ve
had
not
only
their
jencks
act
statements,
these
affidavits
that
were
summarized,
but
in
addition
their
grand
jury
testimony
which
might
have
been
inconsistent
with
their
jencks
act
statements.
i’d
like
to
pursue
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
doubt
that
for
this
reason.
these
very
same
persons
testified
before
a
previous
grand
jury
in
this
case
and
six
out
of
seven
of
them,
when
they
were
asked
in
substance
to
name
the
persons
from
whom
they
received
money,
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
they
did,
when
the
prosecutor
said
“are
there
other
people
from
whom
you
have
taken
money
whose
names
you
don’t
remember?”
they
said
“yes.”
but
when
they
were
asked
this
specific
question
“tell
me
the
names
of
those
persons
from
whom
you
received
money,”
six
out
of
seven
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
now
when
they
come
to
get
an
indictment
against
petitioner,
instead
of
using
the
same
grand
jury
which
knew
about
these
prior,
what
i
would
call
inconsistent
statements,
they
go
to
a
new
grand
jury
and
they
don’t
tell
the
new
grand
jury
that
these
people
have
previously
testified
and
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
they
merely
have
an
agent
who
is
isolated,
from
firsthand
testimony,
summarize
these
affidavits.
and
i
think
that’s
very
far
away
from
any
kind
of
substantive
evidence.
i
should
say
also
that
the
scope
of
this
problem
is
indicated
by
a
letter
which
is
annexed
to
the
government’s
brief,
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
the
solicitor
general,
where
the
united
states
attorney
says,
in
answer
to
my
charge
that
in
most
cases,
indictments
are
being
returned
on
less
and
less
evidence,
he
says
himself
that
his
policy
has
been
up
until
this
very
case
in
the,
and
this
is
his
language,
in
the
so
called
cut
and
dried
cases
to
have
an
agent
summarize
his
interviews
or
his
investigations
of
the
case,
mostly
his
interviews
in
the
cases
the
way
the
united
states
attorney
puts
it.
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
united
states
attorneys
throughout
the
country,
unless
the
law
is
changed,
unless
this
court
says
something
about
it
to
make
a
change,
the
united
states
attorneys
in
this
country
have
the
discretion
now
to
present
second
or
third
or
fifth
or
sixth
hand
evidence
to
grand
juries.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
knowledge
on
that
one
way
or
another
your
honor.
the
only
information
is
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
department
of
justice
does
not
say
in
this
record
any
place
what
their
policy
is
throughout
country.
now
assuming
for
a
moment
that,
and
i
might
say
this
before
i
get
to
the
next
point,
that
if
the
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case
is
upheld
by
this
court
and
this
indictment
is
sustained,
then
this
is
an
effect
a
notification
to
the
united
states
attorneys
across
the
country
that
this
kind
of
flimsy
evidence
at
least
will
be
sustained
and
there’s
no
reason,
there’s
no
motivation
on
their
part
to
present
any
stronger
evidence,
and
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned
as
a
practical
matter,
when
a
prosecutor
says
to
the
grand
jury
after
summarizing
affidavits,
well
if
the
grand
jury
does
say
“shouldn’t
we
have
something
more?”
when
he
says
to
the
grand
jury
“well
you
know
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
sustained
this
procedure,”
that
i
believe
would
be
sufficient
for
most
grand
jurors
not
to
probe
any
further.
now
assuming
for
a
moment
that
i’m
over
the
first
hurdle
and
that
or
might
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
standard
that
i
get
to
the
next
question
which
is
what
should
that
standard
be.
and
i’m
arguing
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
standard
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
should
at
the
very
least
be
the
same
standard
of
evidence
as
one
needs
to
get
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
anomalous
that
you
can
indict
a
person
on
something
less
than
you
can
arrest
a
person
on.
after
all
the
consequences
of
an
indictment,
the
humiliation
to
say
nothing
of
the
expense
of
going
through
a
complicated
or
even
a
non-complicated
trial.
a
much
more
severe
when
a
person
is
indicted
then
when
he’s
arrested
yet
as
this
very
case
shows
a
person
can
be
indicted
on
substantially
less
evidence
than
a
person
can
be
arrested.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor,
i
address
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
try
to
address
myself
to
that
question
in
the
brief
and
i
ask
this
court
to
look
out
for
reference
to
what’s
done
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
constitutional
language
is
almost
identical
to
the
federal
constitution
on
this
point
and
my
interpretation
in
that
state
and
by
statute
only
legal
evidence,
what
they
call
legal
evidence
can
be
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
and
they
go
this
far,
and
i’m
not
arguing
that
this
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
this
case,
in
new
york
they
say
that
you
must
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
as
you
would
at
trial
before
the
grand
jury.
now
addressing
myself
to
that
question,
don’t
you
need
a
hearing
in
every
case,
the
answer
in
new
york
has
been
no.
a
person
must
first
establish
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
there
may
indeed
be
insufficient
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
you
don’t
automatically
get
a
hearing
just
because
you
ask
for
it.
it
might
be
similar
to
an
illegal
search
question
where
the
question
is
“was
there
an
illegal
trespass
by
federal
agents?”
a
person
must
first
make
a
showing
of
some
kind
of
evidence
that
there
was
indeed
an
illegal
trespass
before
he’s
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
i
think
it’s
both.
i
think
its
more
reliability
than
quantum
of
evidence.
i
don’t
suggest
to
mean
quantum
of
evidence.
i
don’t
understand
probable
cause
in
arrest
or
search
warrant
cases
to
mean
quantum
of
evidence.
i
understand
it
to
be
reliability,
and
i’m
arguing
reliability
here
too,
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
that
would’ve
been
clearly
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no
it’s
about
three
times
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes,
there
was
an
arraignment.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
there
was
an
arraignment
after
the
grand
jury
an
indictment,
excuse
me.
mr.
edward
brodsky
not
before,
no
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no
there
was
not,
no
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
what
would’ve
happened
in
this
case
your
honor?
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
believe
its
probable
cause,
the
same
standard
as
is
necessary
for
arrest
or
search.
i
believe
that’s
the
same
one.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
because
there
was
no
probable
cause.
i
think
the
standard
there
is
the
same
standard
of
probable
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
not
necessarily
your
honor,
i
think
for
example
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
no,
the
fact
that
i
was
summary
of
an
affidavit
instead
of
a
person.
for
example,
i
think
that
if
an
agent
in
this
case
had
interviewed
all
seven
of
these
people
and
had
then
gone
to
the
commissioner
and
said
“commissioner,
i
have
spoken
to
these
seven
people.
each
of
them
told
me
that
petitioner
gave
them
money
in
connection
with
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
i’d
be
making
the
same
argument
would
not
be
as
strong
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
much
stronger
case
because
he
summarized
these
affidavits.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
so.
at
least
he
would
have
been
given
word
for
word
to
the
grand
jury
what
these
people
actually
said,
this
would
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
and
swore
to.
i
go
further
because
this
agent
didn’t
even
know
that
these
pieces
of
paper
were
in
fact
affidavits.
these
pieces
of
paper
i
would
assume
what
happened,
i
think
the
record
supports
this,
one
agent
gathered
the
affidavits.
they
were
sworn
before
many
different
agents,
some
10
or
12
or
more
agents
and
one
agent
took
them
all.
he
may
have
had
personal
knowledge
because
maybe
one
or
two
of
these
people
swore
to
these
affidavits
before
the
agent,
but
he
didn’t
have
any
knowledge.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
were
sworn
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
were
in
form
of
affidavits,
no
question
about
that,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
go
to
my
second
point
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
have
no
idea,
i
don’t
know
what
his
name
was,
i
don’t
know
what
his
capacity
is.
the
government
does
not
reveal
that
and
it’s
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
do
not
know
that
your
honor
from
this
record
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
would
think
he
did,
yes,
but
without
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
we
do
not
know
that
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
even
if
you
were
if
it’s
not
part
of
the
record
before
the
grand
jury,
i
make
an
analogy
to
the
arresting
officer
who
has
a
great
deal
of
information
in
his
head
that
he
doesn’t
put
into
an
affidavit.
this
court
has
held
that
you
look
to
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit.
i’m
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
you
look
to
the
four
corners
of
the
foundation
for
the
indictment.
mr.
edward
brodsky
sorry
i
didn’t
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
well
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
no,
you
don’t
call
grand
jurors.
i
--
certainly
i
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
all
proceedings
are
transcribed.
i
think
this
is
the
practice
generally
throughout
the
country.
mr.
edward
brodsky
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes
we
did.
we
asked
for
it
but
it
was
denied.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
no,
what
you
would
do,
yes.
assuming
that
we
can
make
a
showing
as
we
did
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial
testified
before
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
petitioner.
now
that
leads
to
the
question,
well
what
was
the
evidence,
and
we
bring
to
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
we
say
to
the
court
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
of
the
trial
court,
oh
yes!
and
we
said,
please
direct
the
government
to
furnish
you
with
a
copy
of
the
minutes
before
the
grand
jury,
or
furnish
them
to
us
so
that
we
can
look
at
them
and
brief
and
argue
the
point,
assuming
that
there
is
a
point
after
you
look
at
them.
so
there
wouldn’t
be
any
calling
of
grand
jurors
or
calling
of
witnesses
who
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edward
brodsky
at
least
to
the
court.
it
could
be
in-camera.
mr.
edward
brodsky
--
in
the
first
instance,
that’s
the
way
they
do
it
in
new
york.
again
i
refer
to
that,
because
in
the
first
instance
the
judge
himself
takes
a
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
then
if
the
point,
as
they
put
it,
is
fairly
arguable
then
they
give
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
defense
counsel
for
brief
and
argument.
mr.
edward
brodsky
it
did
most
assuredly
does
in
that
sense.
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
problem
we
invade
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
very
often.
we
get
the
minutes
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
when
they
testify
at
trial.
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
said
that
under
some
circumstances
we’re
entitled
to
the
--
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
have
indeed.
mr.
edward
brodsky
they
have
indeed,
during
the
pro
tanto.
i
would
like
to
get
to
my
jencks
act
point
in
the
time
remaining.
after
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
they
were,
counsel
asked
the
government
to
produce
all
of
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
which
came
within
the
jencks
statute.
now
there
are
a
large
number
of
statements
which
were
not
furnished
to
us,
which
were
sealed
in
the
court
below,
sent
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
understand
that
they
are
still
sealed
and
now
they
are
lodged
with
this
court.
now
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
these
statements
are
statements
by
these
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial
in
which
they
admit
the
receipt
of
money
from
other
people,
not
from
petitioner,
and
therefore
the
government
has
said
that
does
not
relate
to
their
direct
testimony
since
they
didn’t
testify
about
other
people
on
direct
testimony
and
that
therefore
the
statements
do
not
fall
within
the
jencks
statute.
i
want
to
put
the
jencks
act
in
what
i
think
it’s
it
proper
context
before
i
argue
how
these
statements
do
indeed
relate
to
the
direct
testimony.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
the
jencks
act
in
terms
of
the
rosenberg
case
in
this
court
in
which
this
court
said
that
jencks
should
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
its
purpose
which
is
to
provide
defense
counsel
with
material
which
might
be
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
so
trying
to
answer
that
question,
was
this
material
useful
for
impeachment
purposes,
of
course
i
haven’t
seen
it,
but
knowing
what
it
is
from
the
statement
in
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
that
it
was
indeed
valuable
for
impeachment
purposes
in
this
way.
the
witnesses
apparently
gave
a
lot
of
affidavits
to
the
government
in
which
they
fail
to
mention
petitioner’s
name.
now
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
useful
for
us
at
trial
to
be
able
to
show
that,
for
example,
on
january
1,
on
january
15,
on
january
20,
and
that’s
the
way
it
is
in
this
case.
i’m
referring
to
dates
with
respect
to
one
of
the
particular
witnesses,
on
each
of
those
dates,
the
witness
filled
out
an
affidavit
in
which
he
purported
to
name,
the
names
of
those
people
from
whom
he
received
money
and
he
failed
to
mention
petitioner’s
name
on
each
of
those
dates.
and
it
wasn’t
until
for
example
april
17
in
the
particular
case
that
i’m
talking
about,
that
he
first
mentioned
petitioner’s
name.
now
i
think
that
would’ve
been
extremely
useful
for
cross
examination
purposes
and
we
were
denied
that
in
the
court
below.
in
addition,
i
think
that
there
was
another
value
for
impeachment
purposes
here
and
that
is
this.
in
the
statements,
the
witnesses
admitted
taking
money
from
other
people.
they
admitted
in
effect
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
i
think
that
on
cross-examination,
it
would’ve
been
useful
and
valuable
for
impeachment
purposes
to
be
able
to
show
each
specific
crime
that
these
witnesses
admitted
in
the
affidavits
which
were
denied
to
us.
now
the
government
claims
with
regard
to
this
point
that
we
did
on
cross-examination
asked
these
witnesses
whether
or
not
they
received
money
from
other
people
aside
from
petitioner,
and
indeed
we
did.
but
the
record
shows
that
in
answer
to
our
questions
on
cross-examination,
the
witnesses
were
somewhat
vague.
they
said
“well,
yes
i
took
money,
but
i
don’t
remember
how
many
people
that
i
took
money
from
or
the
years
or
the
amounts”
and
yet
when
they
were
filling
out
these
affidavits
in
the
privacy
of
their
rooms
with
the
government
officials,
they
were
quite
precise
i
am
sure
these
affidavits
will
show.
they
were
quite
precise
in
saying
“on
july
5,
1965,
i
took
$25.00
from
john
doe”
and
i
think
that
these
statements
would’ve
been
extremely
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
because
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy,
what
we
might
have
been
able
to
argue
to
the
jury
was
that
these
people
were
actually
memorizing
what
they
said
in
this
case.
and
indeed
filling
out
precise
affidavits
and
only
by
minimizing
these
affidavits
could
they
remember
what
their
actual
testimony
was.
they
really
couldn’t
remember
it
unless
they
were
sitting
down
with
government
agents
and
writing
with
government
agents
precisely
what
they
were
recreating
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
brodsky
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brodsky
nothing
further
your
honor.
