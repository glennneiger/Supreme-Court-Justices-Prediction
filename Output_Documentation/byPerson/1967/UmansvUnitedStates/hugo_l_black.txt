justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
he
could
do
that
if
the
law
provides
otherwise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
you
the
question
again,
because
i
thought
you
answered
rather
quickly,
the
problem
that
i
hadn’t
talked
about
until
the
question
was
answered.
so
this
is
that.
suppose
if
he
agrees
that
legal
and
constitution
to
a
grand
jury
to
proceed
on
the
basis
if
they
ever
and
the
court
of
appeals
judge
decides
he
doesn’t
like
this.
i
understood
you
they
hadn’t
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
judge
or
district
judge
but
in
some
way
bar
the
grand
jury
from
proceeding
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
department
of
justice,
the
attorney
general
and
the
executive
office
could
change
that
rule
by
telling
his
prosecuting
officers
not
to
use
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
might
be
--
suppose
the
criticism
was
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
law
is
the
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
only
mean
that
they
would
have
to
bound
to
the
will
of
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
violate
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
did
they
make
that
suggestion
on
the
basis
even
though
the
law
provided
otherwise,
they
were
going
to
say
it,
admonish
the
judges
in
that
circuit
to
take
evidence
is
not
being
missed
there
under
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
that
right
come
from
to
make
that
suggestion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i’m
not
talking
about
interpretative
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
asking
the
question
because
i
hadn’t
--
the
thought
hadn’t
occurred
to
me
that
anybody
would
think
of
this
judge
to
have
that
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
standard
use
in
the
shuffling
in
stanton
case
where
there’s
no
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
standard
then,
wouldn’t
it,
there
have
to
be
some
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i’m
not
--
i’m
just
thinking
that
was
an
instance
in
which
we
had
held.
that
was
the
standard
and
that’s
the
issue
of
no
evidence
at
all
would
take
any
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what’s
the
general
rule
in
the
states
that
provide
for
information
to
be
filed
by
the
prosecuting
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
information
subject
to
attack?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
that
they
got
a
number
of
states
whose
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provide
simply
for
the
prosecution
to
trial
proceeding
by
information
in
any
kind
the
case,
felony
or
misdemeanor,
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
he
does,
that’s
final,
is
it
not?
in
other
words
that
can
not
be
dismissed
by
some
attack
on
the
ground
that
he
didn’t
know
anything
about
it,
or
is
it,
it
is
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
the
preliminary
held
in
many
of
the
states
before
you
can
arrest
a
man
and
hold
them
over
to
the
grand
jury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
hold
them
over
to
see
if
it’s
probable
cause
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that’s
not
in
the
information
stage
as
i
understand.
my
understanding
is
the
information,
they
simply
file
an
information
and
that’s
the
end
of
it.
i
may
be
wrong
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
in
some
of
the
states
to
view,
as
i
recall
it,
one
or
two
hasn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
he
could
do
that
if
the
