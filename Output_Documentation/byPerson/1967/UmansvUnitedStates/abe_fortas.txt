justice
abe
fortas
but
there
are
some
decisions
by
various
courts
of
appeals
that
would
sustain
what
you
have
just
said.
justice
abe
fortas
before
costello.
justice
abe
fortas
but
some
of
these
people,
whose
affidavits
were
rather
summarized
to
the
grand
jury
testified
here
at
trial,
did
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
all
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
did
obtain
their
affidavits,
did
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
that
sense
and
to
that
extent
you
could
obtain
something
that
is
substitute
for
the
testimony
of
these
persons
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
reason
to
think
that
these
affidavits
were
not
prepared
specifically
for
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
is
possible
that
the
affidavits
might
not
have
existed
if
these
persons
have
testified
personally
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
--
excuse
me,
did
the
agent
who
summarized
these
affidavits
for
the
grand
jury
testified
later
at
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
was
he
in
charge
of
the
investigation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
don’t
know
whether
he
was
in
a
position
to
answer
any
question
that
the
grand
jurors
may
have
had.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
grand
jurors
had
questions
about
what
was
covered
by
the
affidavits,
we
don’t
know
whether
he
was
in
a
position
to
answer
them?
justice
abe
fortas
mwhat
is
the
practice
in
this
respect?
is
there
any
general
departmental
policy
or
instructions
with
respect
to
the
use
of
live
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
confined
--
is
it
confined
to
tax
cases?
this
practice,
was
it
confined
to
tax
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
practice
of
using
affidavits
where
it
existed,
do
you
know?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
understand
that,
but
what
i’d
like
to
know
is
whether
there
are
other
districts
too
where
non-tax
cases
this
practice
--
is
this
the
right
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
shortcut.
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
non-tax
case.
justice
abe
fortas
what
eventually
happened
in
that
case?
i
remember
that
did
the
judge
go
ahead
with
the
case
anyway
despite
the
u.s.
attorney’s
refusal
to
sign
the
indictment?
justice
abe
fortas
for
one
point
of
view,
this
might
be
said
that
upon
revealing
this
here
is
an
allegation
of
prosecutorial
abuse,
abuse
by
the
prosecution
and
that
the
prosecution
obtained
an
indictment
from
a
grand
jury
in
such
a
way
in
and
in
such
circumstances
as
to
result
in
invalidation
of
the
subsequent
conviction.
i
suppose
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it?
justice
abe
fortas
which
would
carve
out
the
question
of
what
the
grand
jury
can
do
acting
on
its
own.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that’s
the
next
question.
i’m
just
talking
about
it
theoretically
and
then
let
it
collect.
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
issues?
excuse
me,
what
are
the
issues
of
preliminary
hearing?
justice
abe
fortas

there
are
