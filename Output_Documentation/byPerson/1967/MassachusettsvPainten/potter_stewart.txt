justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
and
take
you
back
one
moment.
now
why
did
the
district
court
alone
have
available
to
the
transcript
of
the
massachusetts
proceeding?
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--is
part
of
the
record
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
one
way
to
account
for
and
another
way
to
account
for
would
be
that
the
district
court
is
--
was
wrong
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
can
we
know
without
having
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
applying
the
post
hope
objective
test
which
you
suggest
and
submit,
by
that
test,
what
was
it
that
brought
the
officers
to
the
door
of
the
apartment?
justice
potter
stewart
well
no,
we're
not
to
the
house
yet.
i
asked
you
what
brought
them
to
the
door
of
the
apartment?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
may
discontinue
a
moment
to
ask
you
to
--
so
that
you
understand
your
position.
you
do
not
contend,
do
you,
that
at
the
time
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
apartment,
they
had
probable
cause
for
a
search
or
for
an
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
i
--
if
we
can
return
for
a
moment
just
to
the
jury
facts.
your
brother
represented
that
the
facts
were
that
after
they
went
into
the
room,
the
first
thing
that
one
of
the
policemen
did
was
to
reach
into
mr.
ash's
pocket.
do
you
agree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
do
you
dissent
to
the
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
district
court's
finding.
justice
potter
stewart
no
search
of
painten.
justice
potter
stewart
and
ash
of
course
--
ash's
case
is
not
before
it?
