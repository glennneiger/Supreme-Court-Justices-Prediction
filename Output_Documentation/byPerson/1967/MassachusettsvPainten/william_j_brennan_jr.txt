justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
policeman's
informed
intuition,
is
that
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
that
from
judge
kaufman's
opinion
that
he
disagreed
with
the
rationale
of
his
colleague.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
one
–
one
of
his
basis
for
concurring
namely
that
as
he
puts
it,
the
officer
used
the
apartment
as
a
conduit
of
convenience
for
seizing
the
bag
on
the
fire
escape
that
therefore
the
--
in
that
circumstance,
the
seizure
of
the
bag
from
the
grading
was
unlawful?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
their
consent
in
other
words
would
embrace
his
appearance
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
take
the
same
position
of
that
bag
that
had
been
sitting
on
the
kitchen
table,
they
looked
into
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
have
a
mug
shot
though,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ordinarily,
they
take
a
mug
shot
only
when
someone
is
arrested
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
what
they
do?
how
does
this
differ
from
abel
where
abel
discarded
in
a
paper
basket
as
i
recall
it
in
his
hotel
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
throwing
it
out
in
the
window
in
a
paper
bag
is
different
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
throwing
them
into
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
still
his
room
though,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
know
why
they
have
it?[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
that
matter
he
opened
the
door
to
let
them
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
really
have
difficulty
seeing
why
there
wasn't
a
consent
to
entry
in
those
circumstances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
opening
the
door
that
seems
to
me
the
second
time
to
invite
them
to
come
in.
what
else
it
could
have
been?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
wasn't
anything
in
johnson
comparable
to
these
set
of
facts
as
i
understand
it.
the
police
officers
arrived,
they
knocked
at
the
door,
painten
saw
them,
painten
said
wait
a
minute.
he
closed
the
door
and
then
later,
he
came
back,
opened
the
door,
stepped
aside
and
let
them
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
have
known.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
no
demand
of
entrance
here.
the
officers
didn't
demand
to
come
in
as
i
understand
these
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
mr.
attorney
--
they
were
around
say
the
third
floor
and
they
stopped
in
the
first,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
fourth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
from
the
third.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
floor
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
just
so
i'm
very
clear
with
you
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
that
the
commonwealth's
position
is
this.
it's
utterly
irrelevant
that
they
had
an
intent
to
make
an
arrest
or
a
search
when
they
appeared
at
painten's
door.
that
there
are
factual
circumstances
that
followed,
it's
clear
that
there
was
a
consent
that
you
argued
to
the
officer's
entry
and
that
the
things
that
followed
thereafter
after
their
entry
justified
the
arrest
as
an
arrest
then
certainly
on
probable
cause
and
that
the
search
of
the
apartment
later
was
incidental
with
that
arrest,
is
that
it?
