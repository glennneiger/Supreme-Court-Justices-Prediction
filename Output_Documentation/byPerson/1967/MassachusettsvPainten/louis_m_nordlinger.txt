mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
just
address
myself
first
if
i
may
to
a
couple
of
the
factual
matters
that
my
distinguished
brother
from
massachusetts
has
covered
quite
thoroughly,
but
a
few
things
i
think
bear
mentioning.
first
of
all,
having
in
mind
the
decision
of
this
court
of
johnson
against
united
states,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
time
of
day
of
the
case
now
before
the
court,
this
painten
case
we're
arguing
today
is
quite
similar
to
the
time
in
johnson
against
united
states.
these
are
both
evening
cases,
just
to
fix
the
time
of
day.
another
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
which
was
not
brought
out
heretofore,
the
respondent
on
this
case,
painten
was
not
known
to
the
police
officer
to
have
any
record
for
any
particular
type
of
offense.
this
appears
from
our
record.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
the
only
basis
for
suspicion
mr.
justice
that
there
was
a
record.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
that's
very
true
then
i
think
we
have
to
concede
that
much
but
the
officer
have
no
knowledge
whatsoever
that
would
connect
this
man,
painten
to
any
robberies
or
any
crime
of
that
nature.
it's
a
different
matter
of
course
as
to
ash,
the
companion.
and
then,
in
the
record,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
we
have
a
rather
complete
record
of
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
and
that
testimony
indicates
that
the
police
came
to
the
door,
showed
a
badge
and
said
only,
this
is
the
police.
there
was
no
mention,
we'd
like
to
talk
to
you,
if
that
were
to
be
important,
but
i
think
that
the
district
court
maybe
had
overlooked
this.
i
don't
know
what
happened.
we
never
made
an
issue
of
it
before
the
united
states
circuit
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
that
finding.
i
think
just
examining
the
same
record
that
is
before
this
court
today,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
police
said,
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you.
now,
there
is
a
finding
if
i
may
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
there
is
a
finding
that
there
was
no
consent
to
the
entry
or
finding
by
the
united
states
district
court.
maybe
it
was
not
in
expressed
words
but
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
respectfully
that
on
page
55
of
the
record
which
is
part
of
the
findings
of
the
united
states
district
court,
the
court
says,
it
follows
that
the
entrance
into
painten's
apartment
without
a
warrant
and
absent
to
any
probable
cause
to
arrest
any
occupant
thereof
was
“under
column
of
their
police
authority”
and
citing
johnson
against
united
states
and
there
was
no
“valid
basis
in
law
for
the
intrusion.
”
i
think
when
the
district
court
judge
included
this
language,
he
had
in
mind
that
there
was
no
consent
to
this
entry.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
very
true.
yes,
that's
true
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
urge
and
i
hope
i
don't
exceed
the
liberty
that
counsel
has
in
this
court,
i
would
like
to
urge
very
seriously
before
the
court
that
this
is
not
an
unusual
situation,
but
rather
this
is
a
very
typical
situation
where
the
states
would
do
well
to
apply
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
there
are
ample
decisions
in
this
area
regarding
the
importance
of
privacy
of
the
individual.
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
bradley
that
i
think
are
so
important
here,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
be
watchful
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizen
and
against
any
stealthy
encroachments
thereon.
or
again
words
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
“we
are
duly
mindful
of
the
reliance
that
society
must
place
for
achieving
law
and
order
upon
the
enforcing
agencies
of
the
criminal
law,
but
insistence
on
observance
by
law
officers
of
traditional
fair
procedural
requirements
is
from
the
long
point
of
law
best
calculated
to
contribute
to
that
end.
”
and
i
think
if
the
court
please
that
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
now
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that
would
have
to
be
our
contention
if
your
honor
please
that
there
was
not
a
voluntary
admission
surely
for
the
purposes
of
search
and
the
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
we
would
argue
that
the
entry
to
the
apartment
was
not
because
the
voluntary
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
whether
we
would
go
so
far
to
say
in
every
case,
the
simple
entry
by
the
police
without
a
forceful
resistance
by
the
tenant
would
mean
that
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
think
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
entire
record,
looked
to
all
the
elements
in
the
case
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
they
did
look
to
what
the
police
had
in
mind
of
course.
that
figures
into
it
but
they
do
not
rely
solely
on
this.
they
looked
to
what
the
police
did
if
your
honor
please.
they
look
to
what
officer
mcnamara
related
was
the
actual
history
of
the
actions
of
the
police.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
having
--
in
treating
your
question
properly,
your
honor,
i
have
in
mind
that
the
courts
have
already
examined
this
problem
to
see
whether
the
police
were
admitted
voluntary
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
whether
they
were
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
talking
or
whether
they
were
admitted
for
the
purpose
searching.
now
we
have
cases
on
this
of
course.
i
think
one
of
the
cases
is
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
the
search
began,
if
your
honor
please,
when
the
officers
entered
the
apartment,
walked
over
to
ash,
the
gentleman
who
was
in
the
apartment.
the
officer
put
his
hand
on
ash's
pocket,
withdrew
a
roll
of
bills
and
examined
these
bills.
i
think
that's
the
beginning
of
the
search.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
let
me
say
this
if
i
may
your
honor,
to
clarify
the
history
of
this
very
briefly.
“we
have
no
problem
with
ash
being
in
a
trial
because
this
material
that
was
seized
as
a
result
of
this
search
and
seizure,”
this
material
was
never
used
in
what
the
officers
claim
was
a
loan
company
hold
up
or
a
liquor
store
hold
up
was
not
used
for
that
at
all.
these
people
were
never
found
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
not
against
painten,
no
your
honor
and
painten
is
the
only
man
before
us
of
course.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
next
complaint
of
course
is
taking
the
paper
bag
from
the
fire
escape
and
bring
it
back
into
the
apartment.
that
would
have
to
be
the
next
element
of
the
search
that
we
see
an
issue
here.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
fact
that
the
paper
bag
was
on
--
either
on
the
premises
or
within
the
cartilage
of
this
apartment,
i
surely
would
urge
that
most
strenuously
and
that
the
officers
had
no
authority
to
search
in
the
apartment,
search
anywhere
in
the
apartment
when
they
entered
and
this
is
just
part
of
the
search
that
they
conducted.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
knowing
how
far
we're
making
an
assumption
here,
but
if
we're
not
assuming
that
the
tenant
that
painten
agreed
to
a
search
of
his
apartment
and
then
of
course
we'd
say
that
it
would
be
immaterial
whether
the
bag
was
on
the
fire
escape
or
on
the
kitchen
table
that
they
have
no
right
to
search.
we
have
in
the
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
see
no
difference
mr.
justice.
the
bag
we
still
would
argue
was
within
the
cartilage
of
the
apartment.
it
was
not
in
plain
view.
we
have
no
trouble
here
with
a
plain
view
case.
this
is
not
a
plastic
bag
that
the
guns
are
visible
in
on
the
fire
escape.
this
is
a
paper
bag
and
the
police
had
no
way
to
tell
what
it
was
until
they
went
up
and
got
it
and
opened
it
up.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
think
it
would
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they're
still
invading
a
protected
area
of
this
tenant's
apartment
whether
they
go
through
the
apartment
or
up
the
fire
escape.
there's
an
equal
invasion
of
this
man's
privacy.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
could
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes
there
were.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
your
honor,
i
can
only
have
in
mind
when
i
answer
that
--
i
can
only
have
in
mind
the
cases
that
we
already
see
in
the
reports
where
the
courts
have
examined
what
is
this
area
in
which
the
material
was
thrown
out.
now
in
some
cases,
it
was
thrown
out
in
the
backyard
of
a
privately
owned
dwelling
and
they
said
that
was
within
the
cartilage.
suppose
the
material
was
thrown
out
on
the
street,
the
back
window
opened
on
a
street
instead
of
opening
on
a
fire
escape
and
the
stuff
fell
on
a
public
street,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
argue
if
that's
within
the
cartilage.
i
think
there,
we're
faced
only
with
an
area
that
is
within
the
protections
of
this
tenant's
premises.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes
your
honor,
i
think
there's
quite
a
difference
in
the
facts
if
you
please
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no.
in
the
case
of
--
in
abel,
he
was
leaving
the
premises
for
good.
he
was
heading
for
detention
and
then
to
prison.
he
was
leaving
his
premises
for
good.
the
officers
were
in
the
apartment.
he
was
told,
“pack
up
your
things,
you're
coming
with
us”
and
as
he
packed
up
his
belongings
in
a
suitcase,
he
threw
a
few
incriminating
items
in
the
waste
basket
and
then
he
went
out
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no
it
wasn't
your
honor.
the
court,
i
believe
that
this
court
found,
that
when
he
left
that
apartment
--
that
room,
he
had
no
more
right
to
what
was
in
the
waste
basket
became
the
property
of
the
hotel
if
anyone
and
the
hotel
gave
permission
to
the
officers
to
engage
in
a
search.
he
abandoned
that
property,
throwing
it
in
a
waste
basket
and
knowing
that
he
wasn't
going
to
come
back
or
take
the
other
case,
if
your
honor
please,
the
hester
case
of
some
years
ago.
the
officers
appear
on
the
property
and
these
moon
shiners,
all
--
i
don't
know
why
they
have
them
but
they
happened
to
have
jugs
and
bottles
on
their
persons.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
know.
unless
they
were
thirsty
your
honor
and
they
took
these
bottles
and
threw
them
aside
just
abandoned
the
bottles
and
threw
them
aside.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
question
of
the
home,
but
aside
from
no
invasion
of
the
home,'
here
they
were
just
throwing
these
bottles
in
the
side
and
running
away
and
the
bottles
were
smashing
around
on
the
ground
right
in
front
of
the
officer.
i
think
there's
a
difference
in
hester
also
and
in
abel
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
clear
from
the
abel
case.
turning
for
a
moment
to
this
question
of
consent
which
seems,
i
think
it's
rather
important
and
i
know
that
to
the
commonwealth's
case,
they
must
stress
the
element
of
consent.
we
don't
have
the
factual
situation
that
was
before
a
court
of
appeals
in
davis
against
california
some
years
ago.
this
is
a
case
which
was
stressed
in
the
brief
for
the
commonwealth
and
i
think
should
be
distinguished
in
that
the
tenant
said,
“come
in
and
look
around.
”
now,
if
painten
were
to
say
to
the
officers,
“come
in
and
look
around,”
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
today.
i
don't
think
it
will
be
much
merit
to
the
case.
in
addition
in
the
davis
case
in
which
a
consent
was
found
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
we
would
be.
yes,
your
honor.
because
i
don't
think
that
the
consent
to
come
in
and
talk
means
a
consent
to
search.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
record
of
testimony
not
--
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
findings
mr.
justice,
the
record
of
testimony
in
the
district
court
which
appears
in
the
record
before
this
court
today
shows
that
the
police
said,
“i
had
my
badge
in
my
hand.”
i
said,
“we're
police
officers.”
the
district
judge
when
he
made
his
findings
added
to
this
that
the
police
said,
“we're
police
officers,
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you,”
but
by
the
time
the
case
come
to
this
court
of
appeals
again,
they
examined
this
record
of
testimony
and
couldn't
find
that
and
they
made
a
finding
that
there
was
only
the
statement,
“we're
police
officers,”
that's
all.
now,
i
submit
also,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
petitioner
test
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
there
would
be
a
difference
if
the
petitioner,
if
the
tenant
had
said,
“come
in
and
look
around.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
he
said
nothing.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
first
time
to
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
then
your
honor
it
would
be
a
very
hard
foot
to
make
an
argument
that
there
was
no
consent.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
think
that
could.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
that's
when
he
first
opened
the
door
and
saw
who
it
was.
he
said,
“wait
a
minute.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
and
they
waited.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
right.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
nothing.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
right.
i
don't
know
if
that's
much
different
than
his
opening
the
door
initially.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
but
if
your
honor
please,
you
have
this
question
before
this
court
in
johnson
against
united
states
and
a
very
same
thing
happened
and
no
consent
was
found.
in
the
johnson
case,
you
have
the
officers
coming
to
the
door.
i
think
this
is
a
hotel
room,
if
my
memory
assures
me
correctly.
the
girl
in
the
hotel
room,
there
was
a
smell
of
opium
in
the
hotel
and
the
girl
opened
the
door
and
the
police
came
in.
she
didn't
say
anything
and
painten
said
nothing
and
there
was
no
consent
in
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
not
the
same
as
johnson
of
course.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
that
there
is
excellent
language,
if
i
may
say
this,
if
the
court
please,
judge
youngdahl
in
this
district
or
i
should
say
in
the
district
of
washington,
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
evans
and
another
case,
i
don't
recall
who
the
district
--
who
the
judge
was,
this
is
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
jude
against
united
states
examined
this
type
of
situation
where
the
police
come
to
the
door
and
there's
no
express
consent.
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
didn't
give
us
actual
consent
to
search,
the
police
said
in
our
case,
“he
gave
us
consent
to
go
in
there.
he
said
he
had
nothing
to
conceal
or
hide,
it
was
perfectly
alright
for
us
to
go
out
there.”
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“invitations
to
enter
ones
home,
extended
to
armed
officers
of
the
law
who
demand
entrance
are
usually
to
be
considered
as
invitation
secured
by
force”.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
just
the
fact
that
the
officers
were
there
and
said
“we're
the
police”.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
would
be
enough,
i
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
--
aside
from
the
opening
of
the
door
and
saying
wait
a
minute
and
then
coming
back
to
the
door,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
very
close
to
johnson
against
united
states.
i
think
a
case
which
calls
for
the
same
sort
of
approach,
the
same
sort
of
thinking
that
we
see
expressed
in
johnson
against
united
states.
now
with
consent
lacking
and
i
believe
that
under
the
cases
like
jude
against
united
states
and
evans
which
both
come
from
this
area.
i
think
with
consent
lacking
and
of
course,
we
have
no
ward
in
issue
here,
and
we
don't
have
those
exceptional
circumstances
that
were
authorized
an
entry
to
arrest
and
search.
the
petitioner
then
is
asking
to
have
the
arrest
and
entry
rehabilitated
by
the
fruits
of
the
search
and
i
believe
this
is
where
the
commonwealth
finds
itself
today.
they're
saying
that
because
we
found
a
paper
bag
and
brought
it
in
and
found
guns
in
the
paper
bag,
that
made
our
entry
valid.
i
don't
see
how
well
the
commonwealth
can
ask
that
the
state
be
upheld
in
the
way
it
handled
this
case.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
how
did
they
happen
to
find
it?
by
seeing
the
bag,
by
seeing
a
bag
and
that's
all,
a
paper
bag
dropped
from
a
window
on
to
the
fire
escape.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
onto
a
fire
escape.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
possibly
so.
you
know
we
have
a
case,
if
your
honor
please,
that
under
the
name
of
work
(ph)
against
united
states
again,
a
court
of
appeals
case.
here,
the
police
approached
the
house
and
the
girl
who
is
in
the
house
as
inconspicuous
she
could,
just
walked
out
the
door
as
the
police
were
coming
in.
one
of
the
police
turned
around
and
saw
this
girl
stuffing
something
in
a
trash
basket
and
then
she
came
in.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“this
girl
acted
involuntarily
because
of
the
presence
of
the
police
and
this
was
not
abandoned
property.”
and
the
police
said,
“no
right
to
open
the
trash
can
and
take
out
the
narcotics
that
the
girl
had
put
in
here.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
girl
acted
involuntarily.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that
the
actions
of
the
police
compelled
her
to
act
that
she
didn't
put
this
material
in
the
trash
can
expecting
that
it
will
be
taken
away
by
the
rubbish
disposal
people.
she
put
in
the
trash
can
under
the
emergency
situation
of
seeing
the
police
come
in.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
to
hide
it
from
the
police.
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
have
that
--
we
have
that
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
commonwealth
--
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
another
case
which
is
relied
on
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
the
case
of
hobson
and
in
the
hobson
case
which
appears
in
both
of
our
briefs,
we
have
something
of
this
element.
we
had
officers
approaching
the
house
and
somebody
in
the
house
opening
a
back
window
just
like
in
painten's
case
and
throwing
the
material
out
the
back
window
and
it
fell
all
the
way
to
the
ground.
now
in
this
case,
in
hobson,
the
court
had
found
that
there
was
the
involuntary
act
of
the
tenant
and
this
was
the
cartilage,
within
the
cartilage
of
the
property
and
within
the
protected
area
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
this
saying
that
in
the
hobson
case,
officers
broke
through
the
door
and
this
compelled
the
property
to
be
thrown
out
the
window
but
of
course
if
the
hobson
case
is
read,
this
is
simply
not
the
factual
situation.
in
hobson,
the
material
was
thrown
out
the
window
when
the
police
came
to
the
door
and
in
fact
in
hobson
unless
i'm
mistaken
be
a
the
same
thing,
somebody
came
to
the
door
and
said
to
the
police,
“wait
a
minute,
my
wife
has
to
get
dressed”
and
closed
the
door
and
i
think
they
use
a
peep
hole
in
that
case.
they
didn't
have
to
open
the
door,
but
in
any
even
in
hobson,
the
property
was
thrown
out
the
window
when
the
police
came
to
the
door
and
then
the
officer
posted
in
the
back
of
the
house
called
to
the
men
in
front
and
said,
“they
just
threw
something
out
the
window.”
and
with
that,
the
officers
burst
into
the
door.
so
it
was
not
the
bursting
through
the
door
that
compelled
the
throwing
of
the
material
out
the
window
in
hobson.
it
was
the
appearing
on
the
scene
by
the
police
officers
which
provoked
the
tenant
to
throw
the
material
into
his
backyard
and
this
was
held
protected,
a
protected
area
and
the
material
was
not
admissible.
i
think
this
is
a
good
case
employed
by
the
united
states
court
below
and
i
think
it's
a
case
that
have
every
bit
of
validity
before
the
court
today.
you
know,
both
my
distinguished
brother
and
i
come
from
massachusetts
and
we
have
a
tradition
in
massachusetts
that
began
200
years
ago
and
this
court
knows
very
well
when
james
otis,
jr.
argued
for
the
discontinuance
of
the
writs
of
assistance
and
i
feel
as
though
massachusetts
should
not
be
down
here
today
arguing
before
this
court
that
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
receive
every
bit
of
protection.
it
should
not
have
every
bit
of
substance
as
pronounced
by
this
court,
traditionally
before
this
court
and
should
be
limited.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
in
a
manner
in
which
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
asking
today.
i
think
it
would
mean
a
regression
from
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
come
to
mean.
i
think
it
would
be
a
diminution
surely
of
what
the
right
of
privacy
means
in
this
country
today.
we've
come
a
long
way
with
the
development
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
compelling
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
general
picture
of
the
country
today
that
warrants
detracting
from
what
the
right
of
privacy
has
come
to
mean
and
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
come
to
mean.
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
thank
you.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
just
address
myself
first
if
i
may
to
a
couple
of
the
factual
matters
that
my
distinguished
brother
from
massachusetts
has
covered
quite
thoroughly,
but
a
few
things
i
think
bear
mentioning.
first
of
all,
having
in
mind
the
decision
of
this
court
of
johnson
against
united
states,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
time
of
day
of
the
case
now
before
the
court,
this
painten
case
we're
arguing
today
is
quite
similar
to
the
time
in
johnson
against
united
states.
these
are
both
evening
cases,
just
to
fix
the
time
of
day.
another
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
which
was
not
brought
out
heretofore,
the
respondent
on
this
case,
painten
was
not
known
to
the
police
officer
to
have
any
record
for
any
particular
type
of
offense.
this
appears
from
our
record.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
the
only
basis
for
suspicion
mr.
justice
that
there
was
a
record.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
that's
very
true
then
i
think
we
have
to
concede
that
much
but
the
officer
have
no
knowledge
whatsoever
that
would
connect
this
man,
painten
to
any
robberies
or
any
crime
of
that
nature.
it's
a
different
matter
of
course
as
to
ash,
the
companion.
and
then,
in
the
record,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
we
have
a
rather
complete
record
of
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
and
that
testimony
indicates
that
the
police
came
to
the
door,
showed
a
badge
and
said
only,
this
is
the
police.
there
was
no
mention,
we'd
like
to
talk
to
you,
if
that
were
to
be
important,
but
i
think
that
the
district
court
maybe
had
overlooked
this.
i
don't
know
what
happened.
we
never
made
an
issue
of
it
before
the
united
states
circuit
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
that
finding.
i
think
just
examining
the
same
record
that
is
before
this
court
today,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
police
said,
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you.
now,
there
is
a
finding
if
i
may
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
there
is
a
finding
that
there
was
no
consent
to
the
entry
or
finding
by
the
united
states
district
court.
maybe
it
was
not
in
expressed
words
but
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
respectfully
that
on
page
55
of
the
record
which
is
part
of
the
findings
of
the
united
states
district
court,
the
court
says,
it
follows
that
the
entrance
into
painten's
apartment
without
a
warrant
and
absent
to
any
probable
cause
to
arrest
any
occupant
thereof
was
“under
column
of
their
police
authority”
and
citing
johnson
against
united
states
and
there
was
no
“valid
basis
in
law
for
the
intrusion.
”
i
think
when
the
district
court
judge
included
this
language,
he
had
in
mind
that
there
was
no
consent
to
this
entry.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
very
true.
yes,
that's
true
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
urge
and
i
hope
i
don't
exceed
the
liberty
that
counsel
has
in
this
court,
i
would
like
to
urge
very
seriously
before
the
court
that
this
is
not
an
unusual
situation,
but
rather
this
is
a
very
typical
situation
where
the
states
would
do
well
to
apply
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
there
are
ample
decisions
in
this
area
regarding
the
importance
of
privacy
of
the
individual.
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
bradley
that
i
think
are
so
important
here,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
be
watchful
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizen
and
against
any
stealthy
encroachments
thereon.
or
again
words
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
“we
are
duly
mindful
of
the
reliance
that
society
must
place
for
achieving
law
and
order
upon
the
enforcing
agencies
of
the
criminal
law,
but
insistence
on
observance
by
law
officers
of
traditional
fair
procedural
requirements
is
from
the
long
point
of
law
best
calculated
to
contribute
to
that
end.
”
and
i
think
if
the
court
please
that
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
now
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that
would
have
to
be
our
contention
if
your
honor
please
that
there
was
not
a
voluntary
admission
surely
for
the
purposes
of
search
and
the
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
we
would
argue
that
the
entry
to
the
apartment
was
not
because
the
voluntary
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
whether
we
would
go
so
far
to
say
in
every
case,
the
simple
entry
by
the
police
without
a
forceful
resistance
by
the
tenant
would
mean
that
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
think
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
entire
record,
looked
to
all
the
elements
in
the
case
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
they
did
look
to
what
the
police
had
in
mind
of
course.
that
figures
into
it
but
they
do
not
rely
solely
on
this.
they
looked
to
what
the
police
did
if
your
honor
please.
they
look
to
what
officer
mcnamara
related
was
the
actual
history
of
the
actions
of
the
police.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
having
--
in
treating
your
question
properly,
your
honor,
i
have
in
mind
that
the
courts
have
already
examined
this
problem
to
see
whether
the
police
were
admitted
voluntary
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
whether
they
were
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
talking
or
whether
they
were
admitted
for
the
purpose
searching.
now
we
have
cases
on
this
of
course.
i
think
one
of
the
cases
is
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
the
search
began,
if
your
honor
please,
when
the
officers
entered
the
apartment,
walked
over
to
ash,
the
gentleman
who
was
in
the
apartment.
the
officer
put
his
hand
on
ash's
pocket,
withdrew
a
roll
of
bills
and
examined
these
bills.
i
think
that's
the
beginning
of
the
search.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
let
me
say
this
if
i
may
your
honor,
to
clarify
the
history
of
this
very
briefly.
“we
have
no
problem
with
ash
being
in
a
trial
because
this
material
that
was
seized
as
a
result
of
this
search
and
seizure,”
this
material
was
never
used
in
what
the
officers
claim
was
a
loan
company
hold
up
or
a
liquor
store
hold
up
was
not
used
for
that
at
all.
these
people
were
never
found
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
not
against
painten,
no
your
honor
and
painten
is
the
only
man
before
us
of
course.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
next
complaint
of
course
is
taking
the
paper
bag
from
the
fire
escape
and
bring
it
back
into
the
apartment.
that
would
have
to
be
the
next
element
of
the
search
that
we
see
an
issue
here.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
fact
that
the
paper
bag
was
on
--
either
on
the
premises
or
within
the
cartilage
of
this
apartment,
i
surely
would
urge
that
most
strenuously
and
that
the
officers
had
no
authority
to
search
in
the
apartment,
search
anywhere
in
the
apartment
when
they
entered
and
this
is
just
part
of
the
search
that
they
conducted.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
knowing
how
far
we're
making
an
assumption
here,
but
if
we're
not
assuming
that
the
tenant
that
painten
agreed
to
a
search
of
his
apartment
and
then
of
course
we'd
say
that
it
would
be
immaterial
whether
the
bag
was
on
the
fire
escape
or
on
the
kitchen
table
that
they
have
no
right
to
search.
we
have
in
the
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
see
no
difference
mr.
justice.
the
bag
we
still
would
argue
was
within
the
cartilage
of
the
apartment.
it
was
not
in
plain
view.
we
have
no
trouble
here
with
a
plain
view
case.
this
is
not
a
plastic
bag
that
the
guns
are
visible
in
on
the
fire
escape.
this
is
a
paper
bag
and
the
police
had
no
way
to
tell
what
it
was
until
they
went
up
and
got
it
and
opened
it
up.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
think
it
would
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they're
still
invading
a
protected
area
of
this
tenant's
apartment
whether
they
go
through
the
apartment
or
up
the
fire
escape.
there's
an
equal
invasion
of
this
man's
privacy.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
could
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes
there
were.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
your
honor,
i
can
only
have
in
mind
when
i
answer
that
--
i
can
only
have
in
mind
the
cases
that
we
already
see
in
the
reports
where
the
courts
have
examined
what
is
this
area
in
which
the
material
was
thrown
out.
now
in
some
cases,
it
was
thrown
out
in
the
backyard
of
a
privately
owned
dwelling
and
they
said
that
was
within
the
cartilage.
suppose
the
material
was
thrown
out
on
the
street,
the
back
window
opened
on
a
street
instead
of
opening
on
a
fire
escape
and
the
stuff
fell
on
a
public
street,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
argue
if
that's
within
the
cartilage.
i
think
there,
we're
faced
only
with
an
area
that
is
within
the
protections
of
this
tenant's
premises.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes
your
honor,
i
think
there's
quite
a
difference
in
the
facts
if
you
please
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no.
in
the
case
of
--
in
abel,
he
was
leaving
the
premises
for
good.
he
was
heading
for
detention
and
then
to
prison.
he
was
leaving
his
premises
for
good.
the
officers
were
in
the
apartment.
he
was
told,
“pack
up
your
things,
you're
coming
with
us”
and
as
he
packed
up
his
belongings
in
a
suitcase,
he
threw
a
few
incriminating
items
in
the
waste
basket
and
then
he
went
out
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no
it
wasn't
your
honor.
the
court,
i
believe
that
this
court
found,
that
when
he
left
that
apartment
--
that
room,
he
had
no
more
right
to
what
was
in
the
waste
basket
became
the
property
of
the
hotel
if
anyone
and
the
hotel
gave
permission
to
the
officers
to
engage
in
a
search.
he
abandoned
that
property,
throwing
it
in
a
waste
basket
and
knowing
that
he
wasn't
going
to
come
back
or
take
the
other
case,
if
your
honor
please,
the
hester
case
of
some
years
ago.
the
officers
appear
on
the
property
and
these
moon
shiners,
all
--
i
don't
know
why
they
have
them
but
they
happened
to
have
jugs
and
bottles
on
their
persons.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
don't
know.
unless
they
were
thirsty
your
honor
and
they
took
these
bottles
and
threw
them
aside
just
abandoned
the
bottles
and
threw
them
aside.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
question
of
the
home,
but
aside
from
no
invasion
of
the
home,'
here
they
were
just
throwing
these
bottles
in
the
side
and
running
away
and
the
bottles
were
smashing
around
on
the
ground
right
in
front
of
the
officer.
i
think
there's
a
difference
in
hester
also
and
in
abel
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
clear
from
the
abel
case.
turning
for
a
moment
to
this
question
of
consent
which
seems,
i
think
it's
rather
important
and
i
know
that
to
the
commonwealth's
case,
they
must
stress
the
element
of
consent.
we
don't
have
the
factual
situation
that
was
before
a
court
of
appeals
in
davis
against
california
some
years
ago.
this
is
a
case
which
was
stressed
in
the
brief
for
the
commonwealth
and
i
think
should
be
distinguished
in
that
the
tenant
said,
“come
in
and
look
around.
”
now,
if
painten
were
to
say
to
the
officers,
“come
in
and
look
around,”
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
today.
i
don't
think
it
will
be
much
merit
to
the
case.
in
addition
in
the
davis
case
in
which
a
consent
was
found
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
we
would
be.
yes,
your
honor.
because
i
don't
think
that
the
consent
to
come
in
and
talk
means
a
consent
to
search.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
record
of
testimony
not
--
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
findings
mr.
justice,
the
record
of
testimony
in
the
district
court
which
appears
in
the
record
before
this
court
today
shows
that
the
police
said,
“i
had
my
badge
in
my
hand.”
i
said,
“we're
police
officers.”
the
district
judge
when
he
made
his
findings
added
to
this
that
the
police
said,
“we're
police
officers,
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you,”
but
by
the
time
the
case
come
to
this
court
of
appeals
again,
they
examined
this
record
of
testimony
and
couldn't
find
that
and
they
made
a
finding
that
there
was
only
the
statement,
“we're
police
officers,”
that's
all.
now,
i
submit
also,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
petitioner
test
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
there
would
be
a
difference
if
the
petitioner,
if
the
tenant
had
said,
“come
in
and
look
around.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
he
said
nothing.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
first
time
to
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
then
your
honor
it
would
be
a
very
hard
foot
to
make
an
argument
that
there
was
no
consent.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
i
think
that
could.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
oh,
that's
when
he
first
opened
the
door
and
saw
who
it
was.
he
said,
“wait
a
minute.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
and
they
waited.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
right.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
nothing.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
right.
i
don't
know
if
that's
much
different
than
his
opening
the
door
initially.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well
--
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
no,
but
if
your
honor
please,
you
have
this
question
before
this
court
in
johnson
against
united
states
and
a
very
same
thing
happened
and
no
consent
was
found.
in
the
johnson
case,
you
have
the
officers
coming
to
the
door.
i
think
this
is
a
hotel
room,
if
my
memory
assures
me
correctly.
the
girl
in
the
hotel
room,
there
was
a
smell
of
opium
in
the
hotel
and
the
girl
opened
the
door
and
the
police
came
in.
she
didn't
say
anything
and
painten
said
nothing
and
there
was
no
consent
in
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that's
not
the
same
as
johnson
of
course.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
i
think
that
there
is
excellent
language,
if
i
may
say
this,
if
the
court
please,
judge
youngdahl
in
this
district
or
i
should
say
in
the
district
of
washington,
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
evans
and
another
case,
i
don't
recall
who
the
district
--
who
the
judge
was,
this
is
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
jude
against
united
states
examined
this
type
of
situation
where
the
police
come
to
the
door
and
there's
no
express
consent.
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
didn't
give
us
actual
consent
to
search,
the
police
said
in
our
case,
“he
gave
us
consent
to
go
in
there.
he
said
he
had
nothing
to
conceal
or
hide,
it
was
perfectly
alright
for
us
to
go
out
there.”
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“invitations
to
enter
ones
home,
extended
to
armed
officers
of
the
law
who
demand
entrance
are
usually
to
be
considered
as
invitation
secured
by
force”.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
just
the
fact
that
the
officers
were
there
and
said
“we're
the
police”.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
would
be
enough,
i
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
--
aside
from
the
opening
of
the
door
and
saying
wait
a
minute
and
then
coming
back
to
the
door,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
very
close
to
johnson
against
united
states.
i
think
a
case
which
calls
for
the
same
sort
of
approach,
the
same
sort
of
thinking
that
we
see
expressed
in
johnson
against
united
states.
now
with
consent
lacking
and
i
believe
that
under
the
cases
like
jude
against
united
states
and
evans
which
both
come
from
this
area.
i
think
with
consent
lacking
and
of
course,
we
have
no
ward
in
issue
here,
and
we
don't
have
those
exceptional
circumstances
that
were
authorized
an
entry
to
arrest
and
search.
the
petitioner
then
is
asking
to
have
the
arrest
and
entry
rehabilitated
by
the
fruits
of
the
search
and
i
believe
this
is
where
the
commonwealth
finds
itself
today.
they're
saying
that
because
we
found
a
paper
bag
and
brought
it
in
and
found
guns
in
the
paper
bag,
that
made
our
entry
valid.
i
don't
see
how
well
the
commonwealth
can
ask
that
the
state
be
upheld
in
the
way
it
handled
this
case.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
how
did
they
happen
to
find
it?
by
seeing
the
bag,
by
seeing
a
bag
and
that's
all,
a
paper
bag
dropped
from
a
window
on
to
the
fire
escape.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
onto
a
fire
escape.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
well,
possibly
so.
you
know
we
have
a
case,
if
your
honor
please,
that
under
the
name
of
work
(ph)
against
united
states
again,
a
court
of
appeals
case.
here,
the
police
approached
the
house
and
the
girl
who
is
in
the
house
as
inconspicuous
she
could,
just
walked
out
the
door
as
the
police
were
coming
in.
one
of
the
police
turned
around
and
saw
this
girl
stuffing
something
in
a
trash
basket
and
then
she
came
in.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“this
girl
acted
involuntarily
because
of
the
presence
of
the
police
and
this
was
not
abandoned
property.”
and
the
police
said,
“no
right
to
open
the
trash
can
and
take
out
the
narcotics
that
the
girl
had
put
in
here.”
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
the
girl
acted
involuntarily.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
that
the
actions
of
the
police
compelled
her
to
act
that
she
didn't
put
this
material
in
the
trash
can
expecting
that
it
will
be
taken
away
by
the
rubbish
disposal
people.
she
put
in
the
trash
can
under
the
emergency
situation
of
seeing
the
police
come
in.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
to
hide
it
from
the
police.
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
have
that
--
we
have
that
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
commonwealth
--
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
another
case
which
is
relied
on
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
the
case
of
hobson
and
in
the
hobson
case
which
appears
in
both
of
our
briefs,
we
have
something
of
this
element.
we
had
officers
approaching
the
house
and
somebody
in
the
house
opening
a
back
window
just
like
in
painten's
case
and
throwing
the
material
out
the
back
window
and
it
fell
all
the
way
to
the
ground.
now
in
this
case,
in
hobson,
the
court
had
found
that
there
was
the
involuntary
act
of
the
tenant
and
this
was
the
cartilage,
within
the
cartilage
of
the
property
and
within
the
protected
area
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
this
saying
that
in
the
hobson
case,
officers
broke
through
the
door
and
this
compelled
the
property
to
be
thrown
out
the
window
but
of
course
if
the
hobson
case
is
read,
this
is
simply
not
the
factual
situation.
in
hobson,
the
material
was
thrown
out
the
window
when
the
police
came
to
the
door
and
in
fact
in
hobson
unless
i'm
mistaken
be
a
the
same
thing,
somebody
came
to
the
door
and
said
to
the
police,
“wait
a
minute,
my
wife
has
to
get
dressed”
and
closed
the
door
and
i
think
they
use
a
peep
hole
in
that
case.
they
didn't
have
to
open
the
door,
but
in
any
even
in
hobson,
the
property
was
thrown
out
the
window
when
the
police
came
to
the
door
and
then
the
officer
posted
in
the
back
of
the
house
called
to
the
men
in
front
and
said,
“they
just
threw
something
out
the
window.”
and
with
that,
the
officers
burst
into
the
door.
so
it
was
not
the
bursting
through
the
door
that
compelled
the
throwing
of
the
material
out
the
window
in
hobson.
it
was
the
appearing
on
the
scene
by
the
police
officers
which
provoked
the
tenant
to
throw
the
material
into
his
backyard
and
this
was
held
protected,
a
protected
area
and
the
material
was
not
admissible.
i
think
this
is
a
good
case
employed
by
the
united
states
court
below
and
i
think
it's
a
case
that
have
every
bit
of
validity
before
the
court
today.
you
know,
both
my
distinguished
brother
and
i
come
from
massachusetts
and
we
have
a
tradition
in
massachusetts
that
began
200
years
ago
and
this
court
knows
very
well
when
james
otis,
jr.
argued
for
the
discontinuance
of
the
writs
of
assistance
and
i
feel
as
though
massachusetts
should
not
be
down
here
today
arguing
before
this
court
that
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
receive
every
bit
of
protection.
it
should
not
have
every
bit
of
substance
as
pronounced
by
this
court,
traditionally
before
this
court
and
should
be
limited.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
in
a
manner
in
which
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
asking
today.
i
think
it
would
mean
a
regression
from
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
come
to
mean.
i
think
it
would
be
a
diminution
surely
of
what
the
right
of
privacy
means
in
this
country
today.
we've
come
a
long
way
with
the
development
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
compelling
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
general
picture
of
the
country
today
that
warrants
detracting
from
what
the
right
of
privacy
has
come
to
mean
and
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
come
to
mean.
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
thank
you.
mr.
louis
m.
nordlinger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
