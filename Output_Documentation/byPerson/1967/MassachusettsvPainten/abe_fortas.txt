mr.
attorney
general,
could
you
tell
me
whether
the
officer
told
painten
the
reason
for
his
arrest?
did
he
say
anything
to
painten
about
why
he
was
arrested?
i
notice
in
page
50
of
the
record
it
says,
it
recites
mcnamara
then
placed
painten
under
arrest
for
suspicion
of
the
hold
up
from
“loan
company.
”
does
that
mean
that
the
officer
told
that
--
said
that
to
painten?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
--
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
did
not
pursue
that
line?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
opposed
to
the
statement
by
judge
kaufman
concurring?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
majority
then
went
off
on
a
different
basis
namely
that
as
i
read,
namely
that
the
police
officer
set
out
to
arrest
and
search
the
man
with
the
hope
that
evidence
would
develop.
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
take
this
step
by
step,
what
are
the
specific
points
of
conflict
with
the
constitutional
doctrine.
the
officers
came
to
the
apartment
and
they
said,
this
is
police
and
then
they
were
voluntarily
admitted
into
the
apartment.
now,
is
it
your
point
that
there
--
do
you
have
an
objection
at
that
point
namely
that
there
are
some
coercion
resulting
from
their
saying
this
is
the
police?
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
–
wait
a
minute,
let's
just
like
about
the
admission
to
the
apartment
without
reference
to
search?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
anytime
the
police
come
to
the
door
of
an
apartment
and
they
say
this
is
the
police
and
people
let
them
in
that,
that
is
an
unlawful
entry
by
the
police,
wouldn't
have
to
be
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
what
makes
this
--
what
is
the
element
that
differentiate
this
case
then
that
makes
this
case
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights?
is
it
the
intention,
the
mental
attitude
of
the
police
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
the
majority
said,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
you
have
to
put
it
in
words
what
did
they
say,
what
did
they
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
right.
well,
let's
take
it
step
by
step
if
you
don't
mind.
then,
let's
assume
for
purposes
of
discussion
that
the
entry
into
the
apartment
was
lawful
by
the
police,
make
that
assumption
would
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
–
for
just
for
purposes
of
these
questions.
then
was
--
what
was
the
next
unconstitutional
act
done
by
the
police,
if
there
was
one
in
your
submission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
make
that
assumption.
justice
abe
fortas
the
search
here
was
not
undertaken
or
would
you
contest
this?
justice
abe
fortas
the
search
was
not
undertaken
until
after
the
bag
containing
the
revolvers
was
found
and
produced.
justice
abe
fortas
now
was
that
introduced
and
there
was
a
testimony
to
that
affect
that
ash
had
in
his
pocket
$200.00
or
whatever
it
was
in
the
bills,
was
that
introduced
as
evidence
against
ash?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
was
the
fact
that
the
officer
found
$200.00
or
whatever
in
ash's
pocket
used
in
evidentiary
manner?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what's
your
next
complaint
about
what
happened?
justice
abe
fortas
what
made
that
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
you
say
the
consent
when
i
went
--
we're
assuming
that
it
was
consent
to
enter
the
apartment
did
not
extend
to
the
cartilage
or
did
not
extend
to
a
consent
to
picking
up
what
was
inside
on
the
fire
escape
or
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
if
i
may
take
another
moment.
the
difficulty
about
united
states
against
johnson
as
i
see
it
is
that
in
that
case
there
was
a
consent
or
acquiescence
consent
--
consents
and
there
was
a
smell
of
opium
coming
out
into
the
hall
but
this
court
held
that
search
warrant
was
necessary
and
that
the
entry
was
unlawful
because
it
was
compelled
in
the
sense
that
there's
always
coercion
implicit
in
a
police
request
to
come
in.
justice
abe
fortas
the
issue
though
in
the
case
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
entry,
not
the
arrest
but
the
entry
was
a
lawful
entry
and
this
court
held
that
the
opinion
by
justice
jackson
that
since
there
was
no
search
warrant
and
since
coercion
is
implicit
and
the
request
for
police,
the
entry
was
unlawful.

you.
