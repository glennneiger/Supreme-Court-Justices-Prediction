mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
allowing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
by
donald
m.
painten,
the
respondent
in
this
court.
the
respondent
had
been
convicted
in
massachusetts
for
armed
robbery
and
other
related
charges.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
affirmed
that
a
writ
of
error
was
subsequently
denied.
the
united
states
district
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
gave
the
commonwealth
the
option
either
of
bringing
a
new
trial
or
discharging
the
respondent.
the
issue
in
this
court
is
essentially
that
of
the
reasonableness
of
police
conduct
held
by
the
federal
courts
to
be
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
since
the
facts
and
the
constitutional
issues
thereby
presented
are
inseparably
interwoven
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
state
the
facts
in
considerable
detail.
and
at
this
point,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
important
to
have
in
view
that
the
statement
of
the
facts
that
i
shall
be
giving
you
is
based
in
its
entirety
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
which
begin
on
page
50
of
the
record.
there
are
certain
discrepancies
in
the
fact
as
they
appear
in
those
findings,
as
they
appear
in
the
testimony
before
the
district
court
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
as
they
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
these
discrepancies
are
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
and
only
the
district
court
had
available
to
it,
the
full
transcript
of
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
proceeding
then
with
the
facts;
on
saturday
evening,
march
1,
1958,
emmett
mcnamara
and
herbert
maxwell,
two
plain
clothes
officers
of
the
boston
police
department
were
on
patrol
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
it
was
a
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
not
available
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
it
is
very
lengthy
and
it
is
not
here
in
this
court.
so
that
we
are
only
--
awareness
of
what
it
contained.
it
appears
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
which
insofar
as
they
vary
from
the
testimony
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
district
court
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
compared
both
and
selected
a
version
which
it
believed
to
be
the
correct
one
and
which
we
now
before
you
are
relying
upon.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
the
district
court
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
the
district
court
explicitly
states
at
the
beginning
of
that
portion
of
its
opinion
that
it
did
so
rely
on
page
50
of
the
record,
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court
record
and
the
evidentiary
type
of
hearing
held
in
this
court
i
find
and
then
follows
the
statement
of
facts
which
i'm
about
to
summarize.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
to
my
knowledge
mr.
chief
justice,
no
actual
dispute
and
yet
in
certain
respects,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
and
for
the
commonwealth
select
slightly
different
versions
which
can
be
found
at
these
various
points,
so
that
i
would
simply
mean
and
make
it
clear
that
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
of
course
we
represent
a
petitioner
and
a
respondent
in
a
situation
in
which
the
facts
and
the
constitutional
issues
are
so
much
inseparable
that
slight
shadings
of
difference
in
the
facts
could
make
a
difference
in
the
result.
so
i
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
findings
themselves
are
part
of
the
record
for
this
court
and
that
rather
than
for
this
court,
for
example,
to
go
back
to
the
testimony
which
you
do
have
transcribed
before
the
district
judge
and
to
draw
inferences
from
that
testimony
ab
initio,
leaves
it
preferable
it
seems
to
me
to
rely
on
the
facts
as
found
by
the
district
judge
who
did
have
the
benefit
both
of
hearing
the
witnesses
before
him
as
well
as
reviewing
the
transcript
before
you.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
in
one
respect
at
least,
their
statement
of
the
facts
does
differ
from
that
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
however,
this
court
may
feel
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
because
the
facts,
the
transcript
in
the
original
proceedings
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
then
the
superior
court
would
have
been
a
transcript
of
some
1120
pages.
and
because
the
--
it
seems
sufficient
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
was
also
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
it
certainly
could
be
made
available.
i
merely
felt
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
that
the
statement
that
i
will
be
making
to
you
is
drawn
entirely
from
the
findings
of
fact
set
forth
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
50.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
sir.
so
then
on
saturday,
march
1,
1958,
these
two
boston
plain
clothes
officers
were
on
patrol
in
the
south
end
of
boston.
they
found
themselves
traveling
behind
a
ford
sedan
occupied
by
two
men.
they
observed
the
sedan
pull
up
in
front
of
a
liquor
store.
it
happened
that
there
had
been
a
recent
rash
of
liquor
store
hold
ups
in
the
vicinity.
officer
mcnamara
saw
one
of
the
two
men
get
out
of
the
car
and
entered
the
store.
he
recognized
the
man
as
the
respondent
painten
from
a
mug
shot,
photograph
of
him
that
he
picked
at
the
police
headquarters
and
happened
to
have
in
his
pocket.
the
sedan
moved
slowly
up
the
street,
turned
around
and
pulled
up
before
the
liquor
store.
when
the
driver
saw
mcnamara
in
the
unmarked
police
car,
he
took
off
down
the
street
in
a
burst
of
speed.
mcnamara
wheeled
the
squad
car
around
and
gave
a
chase,
overtaking
the
sedan
within
a
few
blocks.
mcnamara
recognized
the
driver
as
one
george
ash,
whom
he
knew
as
having
been
convicted
of
several
holdups
in
the
past
and
thus
having
served
time
in
prison.
mcnamara
ordered
ash
out
of
the
car
and
asked
him
why
he
had
fled.
ash
said
that
it
was
because
mcnamara
had
scared
him.
the
officers
looked
in
the
car
and
after
some
conversation,
let
ash
go
on
his
way.
ash
went
back
in
the
direction
of
the
liquor
store.
in
addition
to
the
recent
liquor
store
hold
ups,
there
had
been
a
loan
company
hold
up
that
same
day.
the
hold
up
had
been
described
as
two
white
men,
one
tall,
one
a
little
shorter.
the
appearance
of
painten
and
ash
was
consistent
with
this
description,
scanty
though
it
was.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
returned
to
the
liquor
store
and
showed
painten's
picture
to
the
clerk
who
told
them
that
painten
lived
in
nearby
apartment
building.
they
drove
to
this
address
and
behind
the
building
found
the
car
that
ash
had
been
driving.
painten's
name
was
under
one
of
the
door
bells
at
the
front
door.
mcnamara
returned
to
his
car
and
put
in
a
radio
call
for
two
more
police
officers.
when
these
two
officers,
menia
and
rufo
arrived,
mcnamara
told
them
that
he
and
maxwell
were
going
up
to
see
some
fellows
in
an
apartment.
rufo
was
assigned
to
watch
the
rear
of
the
apartment
building
and
menia
was
left
to
watch
the
front
stairway.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
then
went
on
upstairs
to
painten's
third
floor
apartment
and
knocked
on
the
door.
painten
came
to
the
door,
opened
it
only
a
few
inches
and
asked
who
is
there?
mcnamara
showed
his
badge
and
replied,
“it's
the
police.
we'd
like
to
talk
to
you.
painten
asked,
if
they
would
wait
a
minute.
mcnamara
replied
that
they
would
and
painten
closed
the
door.
while
the
door
was
closed,
mcnamara
heard
inside
the
apartment,
a
sound
like
that
of
a
window
being
raised
and
lowered.
a
few
seconds
later
painten
opened
the
door.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
entered
the
apartment.
inside
in
the
kitchen,
they
found
george
ash
and
a
woman
identified
as
doris
painten.
there
was
some
conversation
between
mcnamara
and
the
occupants
of
the
apartment.
no
search
of
painten's
person
or
the
apartment
took
place
at
this
time.
about
three
minutes
had
elapsed
between
the
admission
of
mcnamara
and
maxwell
to
the
apartment
when
officer
rufo
came
into
the
kitchen
and
said,
“they
threw
a
bag
out
of
the
window.”
rufo
opened
the
kitchen
window,
stepped
out
on
the
fire
escape,
went
down
on
the
landing
in
the
second
floor,
picked
up
the
brown
paper
bag
and
brought
it
back
to
the
kitchen.
mcnamara
opened
the
bag
and
discovered
inside
wrapped
in
wax
paper,
a
32
caliber
automatic
and
45
caliber
revolver
together
with
a
number
of
32
caliber
and
45
caliber
bullets.
mcnamara
thereupon
placed
painten
under
arrest
and
proceeded
to
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
apartment.
in
the
course
of
the
search,
mcnamara
found
and
seized
the
box
of
32
caliber
bullets
and
under
a
mattress
in
painten's
bedroom
about
$980.00
in
cash.
later
the
same
evening,
either
police
officers
found
and
seized
a
roll
of
waxed
paper,
edge
of
which
corresponded
with
the
edge
of
the
wax
paper
that
had
been
used
to
wrap
the
guns
and
ammunition
found
in
the
paper
bag.
now
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
there
was
no
money
found
in
painten's
pocket.
upon
entering
into
the
apartment,
i
left
this
out
only
because
it
did
not
seem
material,
a
bulge
was
noted
in
ash's
pocket
and
mcnamara
reached
into
the
pocket,
presumably
thinking
it
might
be
a
weapon.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
he
might
have.
in
any
event
that
money
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
know
why
he
did.
in
any
event,
that
money
was
not
seized.
as
soon
as
mcnamara
found
that
it
was
money,
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
that
money
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no,
well,
if
it
were
a
search
in
any
event,
it
was
a
search
which
was
in
the
sense
negated
by
the
fact
that
the
officer
did
not
seize
the
object
found
and
it
was
not
later
introduced
in
evidence.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
made
my
point
that
there
was
no
search
of
painten.
the
money
that
you
--
we've
just
been
talking
about
$200.00
in
cash
that
bulge
in
the
pocket.
this
was
ash's
pocket.
there
was
no
search
of
painten
whatsoever
and
no
search
of
the
apartment
as
such
until
after
the
bag
had
been
brought
into
the
kitchen
and
opened
and
the
guns
and
bullets
found.
now
these,
may
it
please
the
court,
are
all
the
facts
which
a
neutral
observer
could
have
seen
or
heard
which
a
camera,
accompanied
by
tape
recording
equipment
at
every
point
in
the
scene
could
have
picked
up.
and
if
these
were
all
that
the
record
contained,
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
case
would
not
ever
have
reached
this
honorable
body.
in
setting
aside
painten's
conviction
however
and
directing
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
either
devote
a
new
trial
or
to
discharge
him,
the
courts
below
relied
on
elements
in
the
record
which
could
not
have
been
seen
or
heard
by
a
neutral
observer.
these
consist
of
mcnamara's
own
impressionistic
attempts
more
than
seven
years
after
the
events
in
question.
under
cross-examination
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
account
for
the
motives
and
attitudes
which
led
him
to
do
what
he
did.
as
their
opinions
make
overwhelmingly
clear,
both
of
the
courts
below
make
mcnamara's
intent
as
they
construed
it,
the
touchstone
of
the
validity
of
his
actions.
thus
as
the
district
court
put
it,
i
find
that
the
officers
went
into
the
apartment
intending
to
ask
painten
a
few
questions
and
then
they
arrest
him
on
suspicion
of
the
loan
company
job.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
doesn't
appear
to
my
--
i
don't
find
satisfactorily
answered
mr.
justice
fortas
the
question
of
what
they
did
say
to
him.
the
reference
is
to
the
loan
company
job
and
the
arrest
are
parts
of
mcnamara's
reconstruction
of
what
he
had
in
mind,
but
i
find
nothing
and
which
differs
directly
to
what
he
said
at
that
time.
the
district
court
then
finding
that
he
did
intend
to
arrest
him
on
suspicion
of
a
loan
company
job
by
going
to
say
in
so
finding,
i
have
in
mind
the
statement
by
officer
mcnamara
at
the
hearing
here
that
if
painten
have
not
gone
from
the
car
into
the
liquor
store,
he
would
have
asked
him
and
ash
a
few
questions
and
then
quoting
mcnamara,
“i
believe
i
would
have
taken
him
to
the
station
for
a
suspicion
of
that
hold
up
that
day.
”
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
observed,
the
commonwealth's
own
evidence
indicates
that
a
search
was
in
fact
intended,
continuing
the
court
quotes
from
the
testimony
of
mcnamara
under
cross-examination.
“was
it
your
opinion?”
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
it
appears
on
page
63
of
the
record
before
you.
“was
it
your
opinion?”
this
is
the
question
of
counsel.
something
was
going
on
in
that
household
to
give
you
reason
to
enter
the
household
without
a
warrant.
answered
by
mcnamara,
“yes
sir.
in
that
household,
it
has
people
with
a
background,
people
that
i
knew
were
in
there,
i
might
be
able
to
solve
a
string
of
serious
crimes”.
further,
the
court
of
appeals
observed
quote
from
mcnamara.
“now,
we
have
them,”
referring
to
ash
and
painten,
“together
in
the
apartment
and
the
hold
up
of
the
loan
company
is
in
my
mind
now
and
i
found
out
he
is
living
there.
these
things
in
my
mind
lead
me
to
arrest
him
for
that
hold
up.”
the
meeting
mentioned
of
mcnamara
as
additional
reference
a
moment
later,
the
officer
coming
in
discovering
the
guns
and
in
this
connection
mcnamara's
testimony
could
be
read
as
meaning,
“these
other
things
i
had
in
mind
plus
the
discovery
the
guns.
”
this
is
the
second
reference
by
mcnamara.
it
is
not
included
in
the
court
of
appeals
quotation.
the
court
observes,
“it
is
apparent
that
the
police
knowing
of
a
crime
and
knowing
that
ash
and
petitioner
were
suspicious
characters,
but
having
no
reason
to
connect
them
with
the
crime
they
are
investigating
set
out
to
arrest
and
searched
the
man
in
the
hope
that
evidence
would
develop.
”
the
courts
below
have
thus
rested
their
invalidation
of
a
state
court
conviction
fully
on
a
police
officer's
efforts
to
bridge
up
from
the
remote
subconscious,
his
motives
through
action
which
took
place
more
than
seven
years
earlier.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
point
is
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
in
supporting
the
district
court
finding
that
mcnamara
and
maxwell
intended
to
make
the
arrest
when
they
went
to
the
apartment.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
our
point
is
that
reliance
upon
this
sort
of
testimony
as
to
mcnamara's
state
of
mind
at
the
time,
particularly
since
it
is
a
testimony
seven
years
after
the
event
can
only
lead
to
a
confusion
and
speculative
tests
of
subjective
attitude
in
application
of
the
administration
of
the
law
of
search
and
seizure.
this
i
think
is
the
irony
of
this
entire
exercise
reconstructing
mcnamara's
state
of
mind.
it's
pointed
out
by
the
fact
that
his
own
introspective
self-examination
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
what
he
and
officer
maxwell
actually
did.
if
when
they
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
apartment,
they
had
really
intended
to
carry
out
an
arrest
and
search.
why
didn't
they
enter
the
moment
the
door
opened
instead
of
acquiescing
in
painten's
request
that
they
wait
a
moment,
why?
after
entering
the
apartment,
didn't
they
arrest
painten
immediately
instead
of
engaging
him
in
conversation
for
three
minutes?
why?
if
they
thought
they
already
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
conduct
a
search,
the
discovery
--
did
the
discovery
of
the
guns
and
bullets
become
the
critical
factor
in
the
actual
timing
of
the
arrest
and
search.
one
can
speculate
of
course
that
mcnamara
despite
his
belated
efforts
to
reconstruct
his
own
state
of
mind,
didn't
in
fact
really
have
any
fixed
purpose
in
setting
out
to
talk
to
painten
and
ash.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
a
series
of
observations,
none
of
which
were
of
tremendous
importance
in
themselves,
first
of
all,
the
knowledge
that
there
had
been
a
rash
of
hold
ups
in
the
area.
the
fact
that
two
men
answering
in
general
the
very
scanty
description
available
to
them
of
the
men
who
would
commit
at
the
most
recent
hold
up,
caught
up
in
front
of
the
liquor
store
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
intent
of
carrying
out
a
hold
up.
the
fact
that
the
one
left
in
the
car
took
off
at
a
burst
of
speed
simply
upon
seeing
one
of
the
officers
that
they
then
upon
going
to
the
house
heard
the
window
being
raised
and
lowered.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
up
to
the
point
where
they
come
to
the
door,
i
think
one
can
only
say
that
this
combination
of
circumstances,
the
noticing
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
believe
that
is
expresses
precisely
what
is
involved
here.
indeed,
this
is
a
way
of
expressing
the
importance
of
this
case
because
this
court
would
have
been
(voice
overlap)
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
we
do
not
contend
that.
we
concede
that
they
did
not.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
and
we
would
agree
that
they
had
no
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
or
a
search
incidental
thereto
after
they
entered
the
apartment
or
at
any
time
up
to
the
point
when
the
paper
bag
was
opened
and
the
guns
appeared.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
they
are
carrying
out
an
investigation
and
of
course,
it
is
essential
to
our
position
that
there
was
no
unlawful
act
at
any
step
of
the
way
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
guns.
if
of
course,
it
were
found
that
they
had
entered
that
apartment
without
consent
of
painten,
this
would
be
a
basis
for
invalidating
what
took
place
thereafter.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
consent
and
indeed,
we
believe
that
the
facts
before
you
require
the
conclusion
that
that
there
was
consent.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
can
only
say
as
to
this
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
account
for
his
characterization
of
what
--
of
what
officer
rufo
did
as
being
the
use
of
a
conduit
of
convenience.
actually,
the
time
when
rufo
entered
and
this
is
quite
clear
i
think
in
the
record,
mcnamara
and
maxwell
were
talking
to
painten
and
ash
and
mrs.
painten
in
the
kitchen.
rufo
entered
and
found
them
in
the
kitchen
and
the
window
he
used
to
go
out
on
to
the
fire
escape
was
the
kitchen
window.
he
was
therefore
if
the
others
were
lawfully
within
the
apartment
so
was
he.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
would
appear
so
and
if
he
were
lawfully
there
then
what
we
have
in
effect
is
a
lawful
entrance
to
the
apartment,
but
which
is
sometime
and
somehow
or
rather
the
exit
there
from
becomes
unlawful
and
thus
used
by
judge
kaufman
to
invalidate
everything
else.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
think
that
the
case
would
be
--
would
be
very
clear
at
that
stage
that
of
course,
the
bag
unlike
the
heroin
in
the
kerr
against
california
case
would
not
have
had
been
obvious
with
respect
to
what
it's
contents
were.
the
situation
then
i
think
is
that
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
direct
attention
to
the
bag.
here,
it
was
the
fact
that
the
window
opened
and
this
particular
item
was
dropped
out
which
of
course
gave
reason
to
inquire
what
it
was
and
open
it.
and
we're
not
aware
of
any
contention
before
the
court
that
the
actual
opening
of
the
bag
somehow
invalidated
everything
else.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
few
minutes
remains
mr.
chief
justice
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
may
it
please
the
court.
massachusetts
certainly
is
proud
of
its
contributions
historically
to
the
development
of
the
protections
of
the
individual.
at
the
same
time,
massachusetts
has
also
recognized
the
validity
of
the
observation
of
this
court
in
kerr
against
california
that
the
states
are
not
precluded
from
developing
workable
rules
governing
arrest,
searches
and
seizures
to
meet
the
practical
demand
of
effective
criminal
investigation
and
law
enforcement.
the
courts
of
massachusetts
indeed
from
their
earliest
history
have
been
engaged
in
the
process
of
developing
just
such
workable
rules.
in
so
doing,
they
have
been
mindful
in
the
words
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
massachusetts
in
commonwealth
against
lawton
that
a
police
officer
in
the
solution
of
a
crime
and
in
the
presence
of
when
he
thinks
committed
it,
is
not
adjudged
with
time
for
mature
consideration
and
the
contrary
in
this
position
more
nearly
resembles
that
in
the
sentry
it
is
post
in
time
of
war,
upon
his
alertness
and
judgment
depends
the
safety
of
many?
the
importance
of
this
case,
we
believe
is
that,
we
have
here
on
the
one
side
a
series
of
steps
taken
by
police
officers
which
in
the
point
of
view
of
those
of
us
who
represent
law
enforcement
do
constitute
the
exercise
of
alertness
and
intelligence
in
the
carrying
out
of
their
responsibilities.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
in
substance
it
shall
validate
that
kind
of
course
of
conduct
or
whether
it
shall
say
to
the
police,
“no,
you
may
not
do
this”
even
though
each
step
along
the
course
they
take
is
justified
in
the
light
of
the
knowledge
and
experience
and
the
information
available
to
them
at
the
time.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
this
is
dealt
with
on
page
53
of
the
record
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
noticing
a
bulge
in
ash's
pocket,
mcnamara
stuck
his
hand
into
it
and
found
about
$200.00
and
$10.00
and
$20.00
bill
stuffed
in
the
pocket.
the
court
then
goes
on,
there
were
some
conversation
between
mcnamara
and
the
occupants
of
the
apartment,
no
search
of
painten
purse.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
this
is
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no
search
of
painten's
person
or
his
apartment
took
place
at
this
time.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
insofar
as
it
appears.
they
went
there
simply
to
talk
to
him
to
find
out
whatever
they
might
find
out
and
i
believe
the
issue
is
quite
correctly
stated
that
they
reappoint
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
which
is
may
police
officers
under
these
circumstances
knock
on
the
door
of
a
person
to
make
that
sort
of
inquiry
and
be
admitted
for
the
purpose.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
they
knew
that
these
were
men
who
had
been
involved
in
police
records.
there
had
been
hold
ups.
they
did
so
where
we
submit
simply
as
a
manner
of
wise
precaution
under
all
the
circumstances,
indeed
a
precaution
which
the
events
prove
to
have
been
well
taken.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
they
certainly
would
not
have
been
in
the
position
in
our
view
to
have
taken
any
of
our
action,
but
for
the
circumstance
that
the
bag
appeared
and
i
might
add
it
was
on
the
second
floor,
below
the
floor
of
the
apartment
in
which
--
from
which
it
was
dropped
and
they
would
have
gone
away.
we
suggest
that
this
is
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
dropped
to
the
second.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
from
the
third.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
with
one
floor
below
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
when
retrieved
by
officer
rufo.
we
submit
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
say
as
to
that
that
if
the
intent
of
the
police
officers
is
to
controlling
test
here
that
there
maybe
basis
for
the
courts
below,
both
to
have
found
that
they
did
intend
to
make
an
arrest,
but
our
position
basically
is
that
the
finding
of
their
intent
whether
or
not
substantiated
in
the
record,
it
should
not
control
the
question
whether
or
not
the
ultimate
arrest
and
search
were
valid.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
and
indeed
they
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
finding
of
intent
should
control
the
determination
whether
or
not
a
valid
arrest
and
search
took
place.
our
position
basically
is
that
granted
that
the
findings
may
have
been
correct
as
to
the
intent
of
the
police
officers
and
then
what
they
did
in
fact
and
the
reasonableness
of
what
they
did
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances
ought
to
be
the
test
and
alone
should
be
the
test
of
whether
or
not
their
action
was
or
was
not
constitutional.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
we
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
even
if
it
had
been
their
intent
to
make
an
arrest
that
that
intent
alone
would
not
invalidate
the
entry
and
in
fact,
they
didn't
make
an
arrest.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
johnson
case
cited
there
is
that
they
smelled
the
opium
in
the
johnson
case.
the
occupant
of
the
hotel
room
opened
the
door
and
the
officer
said,
“you're
under
arrest.
we're
going
to
search
the
hotel
room,”
which
they
did
and
then
found
the
equipment
used
for
smoking
opium.
in
this
instance,
they
went
in
and
they
were
talking
to
them
three
minutes
in
the
kitchen
when
rufo
came
up
and
said,
“he
had
seen
something
dropped
out
of
the
window.”
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
think
the
only
possible
explanation
of
that
is
that
the
officer
saw
the
bulge
and
presumed
that
it
may
be
a
gun.
in
any
event,
nothing
turns
on
this
and
although,
he
reached
into
the
pocket
immediately,
they
were
still
conversing
three
minutes
later
when
rufo
came
up
the
stairs
to
say
that
he
had
seen
the
gun
dropped
out
of
the
window.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
very
simply
and
accurately
does
state
to
the
condition
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
we
concede
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
arrest
at
the
time
of
entry,
but
what
–
our
position
is
that
the
entry
should
not
be
invalidated
with
all
the
consequences
then
flowing
from
this
by
the
mere
circumstance
that
in
the
mind
of
the
police
officers'
entering
was
the
intent
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
an
arrest.
we
say
first
of
all
that
this
is
implausible
in
the
light
what
actually
transpired,
but
in
any
event
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
just
restated
our
position
that
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
however,
one
characterizes
the
terms
of
legal
conclusions
what
transpired
in
that
case
that
the
fact
that
the
moment
the
door
was
opened,
the
agent
said,
“you're
under
arrest,
we're
going
to
search
the
room.”
there's
a
fundamental
distinction.
there
the
issue
essentially
is,
was
there
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
search
consequent
thereon
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
have
suggested
that
the
essence
of
that
holding
is
summarized
in
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
jackson
for
the
majority,
thus,
the
government
is
obliged
to
justify
the
arrest
by
the
search
and
at
the
same
time,
to
justify
the
search
by
the
arrest,
this
will
not
do.
now,
we
would
concede
here
that
there
was
no
cause
of
arrest
at
the
time
of
the
entry.
so,
this
would
suggest
to
me
at
least
that
the
lawfulness
of
the
entrance
was
not
the
controlling
issue
there
and
certainly,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
here.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
the
terminology,
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
indeed
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
allowing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
by
donald
m.
painten,
the
respondent
in
this
court.
the
respondent
had
been
convicted
in
massachusetts
for
armed
robbery
and
other
related
charges.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
affirmed
that
a
writ
of
error
was
subsequently
denied.
the
united
states
district
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
gave
the
commonwealth
the
option
either
of
bringing
a
new
trial
or
discharging
the
respondent.
the
issue
in
this
court
is
essentially
that
of
the
reasonableness
of
police
conduct
held
by
the
federal
courts
to
be
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
since
the
facts
and
the
constitutional
issues
thereby
presented
are
inseparably
interwoven
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
state
the
facts
in
considerable
detail.
and
at
this
point,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
important
to
have
in
view
that
the
statement
of
the
facts
that
i
shall
be
giving
you
is
based
in
its
entirety
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
which
begin
on
page
50
of
the
record.
there
are
certain
discrepancies
in
the
fact
as
they
appear
in
those
findings,
as
they
appear
in
the
testimony
before
the
district
court
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
as
they
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
these
discrepancies
are
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
and
only
the
district
court
had
available
to
it,
the
full
transcript
of
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
proceeding
then
with
the
facts;
on
saturday
evening,
march
1,
1958,
emmett
mcnamara
and
herbert
maxwell,
two
plain
clothes
officers
of
the
boston
police
department
were
on
patrol
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
it
was
a
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
not
available
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
it
is
very
lengthy
and
it
is
not
here
in
this
court.
so
that
we
are
only
--
awareness
of
what
it
contained.
it
appears
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
which
insofar
as
they
vary
from
the
testimony
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
district
court
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
compared
both
and
selected
a
version
which
it
believed
to
be
the
correct
one
and
which
we
now
before
you
are
relying
upon.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
the
district
court
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
the
district
court
explicitly
states
at
the
beginning
of
that
portion
of
its
opinion
that
it
did
so
rely
on
page
50
of
the
record,
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court
record
and
the
evidentiary
type
of
hearing
held
in
this
court
i
find
and
then
follows
the
statement
of
facts
which
i'm
about
to
summarize.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
to
my
knowledge
mr.
chief
justice,
no
actual
dispute
and
yet
in
certain
respects,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
and
for
the
commonwealth
select
slightly
different
versions
which
can
be
found
at
these
various
points,
so
that
i
would
simply
mean
and
make
it
clear
that
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
of
course
we
represent
a
petitioner
and
a
respondent
in
a
situation
in
which
the
facts
and
the
constitutional
issues
are
so
much
inseparable
that
slight
shadings
of
difference
in
the
facts
could
make
a
difference
in
the
result.
so
i
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
findings
themselves
are
part
of
the
record
for
this
court
and
that
rather
than
for
this
court,
for
example,
to
go
back
to
the
testimony
which
you
do
have
transcribed
before
the
district
judge
and
to
draw
inferences
from
that
testimony
ab
initio,
leaves
it
preferable
it
seems
to
me
to
rely
on
the
facts
as
found
by
the
district
judge
who
did
have
the
benefit
both
of
hearing
the
witnesses
before
him
as
well
as
reviewing
the
transcript
before
you.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
in
one
respect
at
least,
their
statement
of
the
facts
does
differ
from
that
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
however,
this
court
may
feel
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
because
the
facts,
the
transcript
in
the
original
proceedings
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
then
the
superior
court
would
have
been
a
transcript
of
some
1120
pages.
and
because
the
--
it
seems
sufficient
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
was
also
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
it
certainly
could
be
made
available.
i
merely
felt
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
that
the
statement
that
i
will
be
making
to
you
is
drawn
entirely
from
the
findings
of
fact
set
forth
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
50.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
sir.
so
then
on
saturday,
march
1,
1958,
these
two
boston
plain
clothes
officers
were
on
patrol
in
the
south
end
of
boston.
they
found
themselves
traveling
behind
a
ford
sedan
occupied
by
two
men.
they
observed
the
sedan
pull
up
in
front
of
a
liquor
store.
it
happened
that
there
had
been
a
recent
rash
of
liquor
store
hold
ups
in
the
vicinity.
officer
mcnamara
saw
one
of
the
two
men
get
out
of
the
car
and
entered
the
store.
he
recognized
the
man
as
the
respondent
painten
from
a
mug
shot,
photograph
of
him
that
he
picked
at
the
police
headquarters
and
happened
to
have
in
his
pocket.
the
sedan
moved
slowly
up
the
street,
turned
around
and
pulled
up
before
the
liquor
store.
when
the
driver
saw
mcnamara
in
the
unmarked
police
car,
he
took
off
down
the
street
in
a
burst
of
speed.
mcnamara
wheeled
the
squad
car
around
and
gave
a
chase,
overtaking
the
sedan
within
a
few
blocks.
mcnamara
recognized
the
driver
as
one
george
ash,
whom
he
knew
as
having
been
convicted
of
several
holdups
in
the
past
and
thus
having
served
time
in
prison.
mcnamara
ordered
ash
out
of
the
car
and
asked
him
why
he
had
fled.
ash
said
that
it
was
because
mcnamara
had
scared
him.
the
officers
looked
in
the
car
and
after
some
conversation,
let
ash
go
on
his
way.
ash
went
back
in
the
direction
of
the
liquor
store.
in
addition
to
the
recent
liquor
store
hold
ups,
there
had
been
a
loan
company
hold
up
that
same
day.
the
hold
up
had
been
described
as
two
white
men,
one
tall,
one
a
little
shorter.
the
appearance
of
painten
and
ash
was
consistent
with
this
description,
scanty
though
it
was.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
returned
to
the
liquor
store
and
showed
painten's
picture
to
the
clerk
who
told
them
that
painten
lived
in
nearby
apartment
building.
they
drove
to
this
address
and
behind
the
building
found
the
car
that
ash
had
been
driving.
painten's
name
was
under
one
of
the
door
bells
at
the
front
door.
mcnamara
returned
to
his
car
and
put
in
a
radio
call
for
two
more
police
officers.
when
these
two
officers,
menia
and
rufo
arrived,
mcnamara
told
them
that
he
and
maxwell
were
going
up
to
see
some
fellows
in
an
apartment.
rufo
was
assigned
to
watch
the
rear
of
the
apartment
building
and
menia
was
left
to
watch
the
front
stairway.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
then
went
on
upstairs
to
painten's
third
floor
apartment
and
knocked
on
the
door.
painten
came
to
the
door,
opened
it
only
a
few
inches
and
asked
who
is
there?
mcnamara
showed
his
badge
and
replied,
“it's
the
police.
we'd
like
to
talk
to
you.
painten
asked,
if
they
would
wait
a
minute.
mcnamara
replied
that
they
would
and
painten
closed
the
door.
while
the
door
was
closed,
mcnamara
heard
inside
the
apartment,
a
sound
like
that
of
a
window
being
raised
and
lowered.
a
few
seconds
later
painten
opened
the
door.
mcnamara
and
maxwell
entered
the
apartment.
inside
in
the
kitchen,
they
found
george
ash
and
a
woman
identified
as
doris
painten.
there
was
some
conversation
between
mcnamara
and
the
occupants
of
the
apartment.
no
search
of
painten's
person
or
the
apartment
took
place
at
this
time.
about
three
minutes
had
elapsed
between
the
admission
of
mcnamara
and
maxwell
to
the
apartment
when
officer
rufo
came
into
the
kitchen
and
said,
“they
threw
a
bag
out
of
the
window.”
rufo
opened
the
kitchen
window,
stepped
out
on
the
fire
escape,
went
down
on
the
landing
in
the
second
floor,
picked
up
the
brown
paper
bag
and
brought
it
back
to
the
kitchen.
mcnamara
opened
the
bag
and
discovered
inside
wrapped
in
wax
paper,
a
32
caliber
automatic
and
45
caliber
revolver
together
with
a
number
of
32
caliber
and
45
caliber
bullets.
mcnamara
thereupon
placed
painten
under
arrest
and
proceeded
to
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
apartment.
in
the
course
of
the
search,
mcnamara
found
and
seized
the
box
of
32
caliber
bullets
and
under
a
mattress
in
painten's
bedroom
about
$980.00
in
cash.
later
the
same
evening,
either
police
officers
found
and
seized
a
roll
of
waxed
paper,
edge
of
which
corresponded
with
the
edge
of
the
wax
paper
that
had
been
used
to
wrap
the
guns
and
ammunition
found
in
the
paper
bag.
now
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
there
was
no
money
found
in
painten's
pocket.
upon
entering
into
the
apartment,
i
left
this
out
only
because
it
did
not
seem
material,
a
bulge
was
noted
in
ash's
pocket
and
mcnamara
reached
into
the
pocket,
presumably
thinking
it
might
be
a
weapon.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
he
might
have.
in
any
event
that
money
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
know
why
he
did.
in
any
event,
that
money
was
not
seized.
as
soon
as
mcnamara
found
that
it
was
money,
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
that
money
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no,
well,
if
it
were
a
search
in
any
event,
it
was
a
search
which
was
in
the
sense
negated
by
the
fact
that
the
officer
did
not
seize
the
object
found
and
it
was
not
later
introduced
in
evidence.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
made
my
point
that
there
was
no
search
of
painten.
the
money
that
you
--
we've
just
been
talking
about
$200.00
in
cash
that
bulge
in
the
pocket.
this
was
ash's
pocket.
there
was
no
search
of
painten
whatsoever
and
no
search
of
the
apartment
as
such
until
after
the
bag
had
been
brought
into
the
kitchen
and
opened
and
the
guns
and
bullets
found.
now
these,
may
it
please
the
court,
are
all
the
facts
which
a
neutral
observer
could
have
seen
or
heard
which
a
camera,
accompanied
by
tape
recording
equipment
at
every
point
in
the
scene
could
have
picked
up.
and
if
these
were
all
that
the
record
contained,
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
case
would
not
ever
have
reached
this
honorable
body.
in
setting
aside
painten's
conviction
however
and
directing
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
either
devote
a
new
trial
or
to
discharge
him,
the
courts
below
relied
on
elements
in
the
record
which
could
not
have
been
seen
or
heard
by
a
neutral
observer.
these
consist
of
mcnamara's
own
impressionistic
attempts
more
than
seven
years
after
the
events
in
question.
under
cross-examination
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
account
for
the
motives
and
attitudes
which
led
him
to
do
what
he
did.
as
their
opinions
make
overwhelmingly
clear,
both
of
the
courts
below
make
mcnamara's
intent
as
they
construed
it,
the
touchstone
of
the
validity
of
his
actions.
thus
as
the
district
court
put
it,
i
find
that
the
officers
went
into
the
apartment
intending
to
ask
painten
a
few
questions
and
then
they
arrest
him
on
suspicion
of
the
loan
company
job.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
doesn't
appear
to
my
--
i
don't
find
satisfactorily
answered
mr.
justice
fortas
the
question
of
what
they
did
say
to
him.
the
reference
is
to
the
loan
company
job
and
the
arrest
are
parts
of
mcnamara's
reconstruction
of
what
he
had
in
mind,
but
i
find
nothing
and
which
differs
directly
to
what
he
said
at
that
time.
the
district
court
then
finding
that
he
did
intend
to
arrest
him
on
suspicion
of
a
loan
company
job
by
going
to
say
in
so
finding,
i
have
in
mind
the
statement
by
officer
mcnamara
at
the
hearing
here
that
if
painten
have
not
gone
from
the
car
into
the
liquor
store,
he
would
have
asked
him
and
ash
a
few
questions
and
then
quoting
mcnamara,
“i
believe
i
would
have
taken
him
to
the
station
for
a
suspicion
of
that
hold
up
that
day.
”
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
observed,
the
commonwealth's
own
evidence
indicates
that
a
search
was
in
fact
intended,
continuing
the
court
quotes
from
the
testimony
of
mcnamara
under
cross-examination.
“was
it
your
opinion?”
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
it
appears
on
page
63
of
the
record
before
you.
“was
it
your
opinion?”
this
is
the
question
of
counsel.
something
was
going
on
in
that
household
to
give
you
reason
to
enter
the
household
without
a
warrant.
answered
by
mcnamara,
“yes
sir.
in
that
household,
it
has
people
with
a
background,
people
that
i
knew
were
in
there,
i
might
be
able
to
solve
a
string
of
serious
crimes”.
further,
the
court
of
appeals
observed
quote
from
mcnamara.
“now,
we
have
them,”
referring
to
ash
and
painten,
“together
in
the
apartment
and
the
hold
up
of
the
loan
company
is
in
my
mind
now
and
i
found
out
he
is
living
there.
these
things
in
my
mind
lead
me
to
arrest
him
for
that
hold
up.”
the
meeting
mentioned
of
mcnamara
as
additional
reference
a
moment
later,
the
officer
coming
in
discovering
the
guns
and
in
this
connection
mcnamara's
testimony
could
be
read
as
meaning,
“these
other
things
i
had
in
mind
plus
the
discovery
the
guns.
”
this
is
the
second
reference
by
mcnamara.
it
is
not
included
in
the
court
of
appeals
quotation.
the
court
observes,
“it
is
apparent
that
the
police
knowing
of
a
crime
and
knowing
that
ash
and
petitioner
were
suspicious
characters,
but
having
no
reason
to
connect
them
with
the
crime
they
are
investigating
set
out
to
arrest
and
searched
the
man
in
the
hope
that
evidence
would
develop.
”
the
courts
below
have
thus
rested
their
invalidation
of
a
state
court
conviction
fully
on
a
police
officer's
efforts
to
bridge
up
from
the
remote
subconscious,
his
motives
through
action
which
took
place
more
than
seven
years
earlier.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
point
is
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
in
supporting
the
district
court
finding
that
mcnamara
and
maxwell
intended
to
make
the
arrest
when
they
went
to
the
apartment.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
our
point
is
that
reliance
upon
this
sort
of
testimony
as
to
mcnamara's
state
of
mind
at
the
time,
particularly
since
it
is
a
testimony
seven
years
after
the
event
can
only
lead
to
a
confusion
and
speculative
tests
of
subjective
attitude
in
application
of
the
administration
of
the
law
of
search
and
seizure.
this
i
think
is
the
irony
of
this
entire
exercise
reconstructing
mcnamara's
state
of
mind.
it's
pointed
out
by
the
fact
that
his
own
introspective
self-examination
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
what
he
and
officer
maxwell
actually
did.
if
when
they
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
apartment,
they
had
really
intended
to
carry
out
an
arrest
and
search.
why
didn't
they
enter
the
moment
the
door
opened
instead
of
acquiescing
in
painten's
request
that
they
wait
a
moment,
why?
after
entering
the
apartment,
didn't
they
arrest
painten
immediately
instead
of
engaging
him
in
conversation
for
three
minutes?
why?
if
they
thought
they
already
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
conduct
a
search,
the
discovery
--
did
the
discovery
of
the
guns
and
bullets
become
the
critical
factor
in
the
actual
timing
of
the
arrest
and
search.
one
can
speculate
of
course
that
mcnamara
despite
his
belated
efforts
to
reconstruct
his
own
state
of
mind,
didn't
in
fact
really
have
any
fixed
purpose
in
setting
out
to
talk
to
painten
and
ash.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
a
series
of
observations,
none
of
which
were
of
tremendous
importance
in
themselves,
first
of
all,
the
knowledge
that
there
had
been
a
rash
of
hold
ups
in
the
area.
the
fact
that
two
men
answering
in
general
the
very
scanty
description
available
to
them
of
the
men
who
would
commit
at
the
most
recent
hold
up,
caught
up
in
front
of
the
liquor
store
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
intent
of
carrying
out
a
hold
up.
the
fact
that
the
one
left
in
the
car
took
off
at
a
burst
of
speed
simply
upon
seeing
one
of
the
officers
that
they
then
upon
going
to
the
house
heard
the
window
being
raised
and
lowered.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
up
to
the
point
where
they
come
to
the
door,
i
think
one
can
only
say
that
this
combination
of
circumstances,
the
noticing
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
believe
that
is
expresses
precisely
what
is
involved
here.
indeed,
this
is
a
way
of
expressing
the
importance
of
this
case
because
this
court
would
have
been
(voice
overlap)
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
we
do
not
contend
that.
we
concede
that
they
did
not.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
and
we
would
agree
that
they
had
no
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
or
a
search
incidental
thereto
after
they
entered
the
apartment
or
at
any
time
up
to
the
point
when
the
paper
bag
was
opened
and
the
guns
appeared.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
they
are
carrying
out
an
investigation
and
of
course,
it
is
essential
to
our
position
that
there
was
no
unlawful
act
at
any
step
of
the
way
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
guns.
if
of
course,
it
were
found
that
they
had
entered
that
apartment
without
consent
of
painten,
this
would
be
a
basis
for
invalidating
what
took
place
thereafter.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
consent
and
indeed,
we
believe
that
the
facts
before
you
require
the
conclusion
that
that
there
was
consent.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
can
only
say
as
to
this
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
account
for
his
characterization
of
what
--
of
what
officer
rufo
did
as
being
the
use
of
a
conduit
of
convenience.
actually,
the
time
when
rufo
entered
and
this
is
quite
clear
i
think
in
the
record,
mcnamara
and
maxwell
were
talking
to
painten
and
ash
and
mrs.
painten
in
the
kitchen.
rufo
entered
and
found
them
in
the
kitchen
and
the
window
he
used
to
go
out
on
to
the
fire
escape
was
the
kitchen
window.
he
was
therefore
if
the
others
were
lawfully
within
the
apartment
so
was
he.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
would
appear
so
and
if
he
were
lawfully
there
then
what
we
have
in
effect
is
a
lawful
entrance
to
the
apartment,
but
which
is
sometime
and
somehow
or
rather
the
exit
there
from
becomes
unlawful
and
thus
used
by
judge
kaufman
to
invalidate
everything
else.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
think
that
the
case
would
be
--
would
be
very
clear
at
that
stage
that
of
course,
the
bag
unlike
the
heroin
in
the
kerr
against
california
case
would
not
have
had
been
obvious
with
respect
to
what
it's
contents
were.
the
situation
then
i
think
is
that
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
direct
attention
to
the
bag.
here,
it
was
the
fact
that
the
window
opened
and
this
particular
item
was
dropped
out
which
of
course
gave
reason
to
inquire
what
it
was
and
open
it.
and
we're
not
aware
of
any
contention
before
the
court
that
the
actual
opening
of
the
bag
somehow
invalidated
everything
else.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
few
minutes
remains
mr.
chief
justice
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
may
it
please
the
court.
massachusetts
certainly
is
proud
of
its
contributions
historically
to
the
development
of
the
protections
of
the
individual.
at
the
same
time,
massachusetts
has
also
recognized
the
validity
of
the
observation
of
this
court
in
kerr
against
california
that
the
states
are
not
precluded
from
developing
workable
rules
governing
arrest,
searches
and
seizures
to
meet
the
practical
demand
of
effective
criminal
investigation
and
law
enforcement.
the
courts
of
massachusetts
indeed
from
their
earliest
history
have
been
engaged
in
the
process
of
developing
just
such
workable
rules.
in
so
doing,
they
have
been
mindful
in
the
words
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
massachusetts
in
commonwealth
against
lawton
that
a
police
officer
in
the
solution
of
a
crime
and
in
the
presence
of
when
he
thinks
committed
it,
is
not
adjudged
with
time
for
mature
consideration
and
the
contrary
in
this
position
more
nearly
resembles
that
in
the
sentry
it
is
post
in
time
of
war,
upon
his
alertness
and
judgment
depends
the
safety
of
many?
the
importance
of
this
case,
we
believe
is
that,
we
have
here
on
the
one
side
a
series
of
steps
taken
by
police
officers
which
in
the
point
of
view
of
those
of
us
who
represent
law
enforcement
do
constitute
the
exercise
of
alertness
and
intelligence
in
the
carrying
out
of
their
responsibilities.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
in
substance
it
shall
validate
that
kind
of
course
of
conduct
or
whether
it
shall
say
to
the
police,
“no,
you
may
not
do
this”
even
though
each
step
along
the
course
they
take
is
justified
in
the
light
of
the
knowledge
and
experience
and
the
information
available
to
them
at
the
time.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
this
is
dealt
with
on
page
53
of
the
record
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
noticing
a
bulge
in
ash's
pocket,
mcnamara
stuck
his
hand
into
it
and
found
about
$200.00
and
$10.00
and
$20.00
bill
stuffed
in
the
pocket.
the
court
then
goes
on,
there
were
some
conversation
between
mcnamara
and
the
occupants
of
the
apartment,
no
search
of
painten
purse.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
this
is
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no
search
of
painten's
person
or
his
apartment
took
place
at
this
time.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
insofar
as
it
appears.
they
went
there
simply
to
talk
to
him
to
find
out
whatever
they
might
find
out
and
i
believe
the
issue
is
quite
correctly
stated
that
they
reappoint
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
which
is
may
police
officers
under
these
circumstances
knock
on
the
door
of
a
person
to
make
that
sort
of
inquiry
and
be
admitted
for
the
purpose.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
they
knew
that
these
were
men
who
had
been
involved
in
police
records.
there
had
been
hold
ups.
they
did
so
where
we
submit
simply
as
a
manner
of
wise
precaution
under
all
the
circumstances,
indeed
a
precaution
which
the
events
prove
to
have
been
well
taken.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
they
certainly
would
not
have
been
in
the
position
in
our
view
to
have
taken
any
of
our
action,
but
for
the
circumstance
that
the
bag
appeared
and
i
might
add
it
was
on
the
second
floor,
below
the
floor
of
the
apartment
in
which
--
from
which
it
was
dropped
and
they
would
have
gone
away.
we
suggest
that
this
is
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
it
dropped
to
the
second.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
from
the
third.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
with
one
floor
below
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
--
when
retrieved
by
officer
rufo.
we
submit
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
say
as
to
that
that
if
the
intent
of
the
police
officers
is
to
controlling
test
here
that
there
maybe
basis
for
the
courts
below,
both
to
have
found
that
they
did
intend
to
make
an
arrest,
but
our
position
basically
is
that
the
finding
of
their
intent
whether
or
not
substantiated
in
the
record,
it
should
not
control
the
question
whether
or
not
the
ultimate
arrest
and
search
were
valid.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
and
indeed
they
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
finding
of
intent
should
control
the
determination
whether
or
not
a
valid
arrest
and
search
took
place.
our
position
basically
is
that
granted
that
the
findings
may
have
been
correct
as
to
the
intent
of
the
police
officers
and
then
what
they
did
in
fact
and
the
reasonableness
of
what
they
did
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances
ought
to
be
the
test
and
alone
should
be
the
test
of
whether
or
not
their
action
was
or
was
not
constitutional.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
we
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
even
if
it
had
been
their
intent
to
make
an
arrest
that
that
intent
alone
would
not
invalidate
the
entry
and
in
fact,
they
didn't
make
an
arrest.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
johnson
case
cited
there
is
that
they
smelled
the
opium
in
the
johnson
case.
the
occupant
of
the
hotel
room
opened
the
door
and
the
officer
said,
“you're
under
arrest.
we're
going
to
search
the
hotel
room,”
which
they
did
and
then
found
the
equipment
used
for
smoking
opium.
in
this
instance,
they
went
in
and
they
were
talking
to
them
three
minutes
in
the
kitchen
when
rufo
came
up
and
said,
“he
had
seen
something
dropped
out
of
the
window.”
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
i
think
the
only
possible
explanation
of
that
is
that
the
officer
saw
the
bulge
and
presumed
that
it
may
be
a
gun.
in
any
event,
nothing
turns
on
this
and
although,
he
reached
into
the
pocket
immediately,
they
were
still
conversing
three
minutes
later
when
rufo
came
up
the
stairs
to
say
that
he
had
seen
the
gun
dropped
out
of
the
window.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
very
simply
and
accurately
does
state
to
the
condition
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
we
concede
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
arrest
at
the
time
of
entry,
but
what
–
our
position
is
that
the
entry
should
not
be
invalidated
with
all
the
consequences
then
flowing
from
this
by
the
mere
circumstance
that
in
the
mind
of
the
police
officers'
entering
was
the
intent
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
an
arrest.
we
say
first
of
all
that
this
is
implausible
in
the
light
what
actually
transpired,
but
in
any
event
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
just
restated
our
position
that
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
however,
one
characterizes
the
terms
of
legal
conclusions
what
transpired
in
that
case
that
the
fact
that
the
moment
the
door
was
opened,
the
agent
said,
“you're
under
arrest,
we're
going
to
search
the
room.”
there's
a
fundamental
distinction.
there
the
issue
essentially
is,
was
there
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
search
consequent
thereon
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
have
suggested
that
the
essence
of
that
holding
is
summarized
in
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
jackson
for
the
majority,
thus,
the
government
is
obliged
to
justify
the
arrest
by
the
search
and
at
the
same
time,
to
justify
the
search
by
the
arrest,
this
will
not
do.
now,
we
would
concede
here
that
there
was
no
cause
of
arrest
at
the
time
of
the
entry.
so,
this
would
suggest
to
me
at
least
that
the
lawfulness
of
the
entrance
was
not
the
controlling
issue
there
and
certainly,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
here.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
no,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
the
terminology,
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
indeed
--
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
richardson
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
