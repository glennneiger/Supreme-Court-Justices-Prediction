defendant
as
a

of
the
voluntary
defenders
committee
of
your
community.

considers
that
it's
very
important
that

are
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that

of

would
have
an
organization
of
that
kind
that
can
see
to
it
that
every
indigent
defendant
is
given
his
rights
in

and
of

we're
always
comforted
by
the
facts
that
