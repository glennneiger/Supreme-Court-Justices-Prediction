paragraph

shall
not

securities
in
the

corporation
are
received
and
no
securities
are
surrendered
in

with
such
distribution.

so
security
--
so
the
security
does
not
apply
to
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
wholly
inapplicable
to
this
case
because
securities
weren't
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
--
it
was
over
what
they
paid
for
it,
$16
is
more
than
they
paid
for
it.

do
you
think
it's
a
distribution
that
you
sell
stock
of
stockholders
even
if
it
is
sold
at
fair
market
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
section
355,
why
it's
unquestioned
that
the
distribution
of
the
stock
would
have
been
a
taxable
dividend?
justice

well,
aside
from
the
reorganizations,
if
a
corporation
which
has
owned
stock
in
another
company,
in
an
unrelated
company
for
some
time
and
the
stockholder's
--
the
value
of
the
stockholder's
stock
has
reflected
the
value
of
that
corporate
holding.
if
that
stock
is
simply
distributed
to
stockholders,
it's
normally
a
taxable
dividend?
justice
byron

is
that
issue
here
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.

but
the
fact
that
the
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
stockholders'
interest
hasn't
changed
any
--
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
distribution
is
taxable?
justice
byron

that's
an
interesting
fact.

could

ask
you
if
it

the

company

most
of

distributed

it

now,
will
they
pay
tax
or
will
they
