mr.
harry
r.
horrow
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
here.
one
issue
arises
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
northwest
rights.
the
other
issue
relates
to
the
sale
of
the
northwest
rights.
the
solicitor
general
misspoke
in
referring
to
the
sale
issue
as
arising
in
the
bann
case.
actually,
it
arose
in
the
gordon
case
and
the
bann
case
involves
only
the
exercise
of
rights
issue,
the
same
issue
that
is
involved
in
the
gordon
case.
addressing
myself
first
to
the
exercise
issue,
i
should
like
to
review
briefly
the
facts
giving
rise
to
the
reorganization
that
is
in
question
here.
pacific
operated
the
telephone
business
in
the
four
western
states,
california,
washington,
oregon
and
idaho
prior
to
july
1,
1961.
this
territory
experienced
enormous
growth
in
the
post-war
period,
so
much
so
that
it
was
apparent
that
extreme
administrative
difficulties
were
being
generated
by
the
expansion
which
was
taking
place.
the
company
therefore
undertook
a
study
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
desirable
to
divide
pacific
into
two
or
more
corporations
and
this
study
took
place
over
a
period
of
about
two
years,
which
begun
in
1958.
the
result
of
the
study
was
that
it
was
desirable
to
divide
the
business
of
pacific
into
two
corporations,
one
which
would
have
all
of
the
business
and
assets
in
the
three
northwest
states,
and
the
other
the
remaining
operations
in
california.
the
reasons
for
the
division
were
to
have
a
management
and
a
board
drawn
from
the
area
served
so
that
there
would
be
a
better
understanding
of
the
service
needs,
so
that
there
would
be
better
relations
with
customers,
employees,
and
government
officials.
the
plan
to
divide
the
pacific
company
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
devising
a
means
of
raising
capital.
based
on
this
study,
it
was
determined
to
proceed
with
the
division
of
the
pacific
company.
the
most
obvious
way
of
affecting
this
division
would
be
by
transferring
all
of
the
assets
and
business
in
the
three
northwest
states
to
a
new
corporation,
and
then
simply
distributing
the
stock
of
that
corporation
pro
rata
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
such
a
distribution
would
have
taken
the
form
of
a
dividend
and
would
have
had
to
be
charged
to
the
earned
surplus
of
pacific.
pacific
did
not
have
sufficient
surplus
for
this
purpose.
accordingly,
counsel
for
the
company
advised
pacific
management
that
under
the
california
law,
it
could
not
create
northwest
and
distribute
the
northwest
stock
directly
to
the
pacific
shareholders
without
the
payment
of
any
consideration.
the
plan
then
devised
in
conformity
with
the
california
law
was
to
affect
a
distribution
of
a
northwest
stock
by
rights
offerings.
the
northwest
assets
represented
about
20%
of
pacific's
business
and
when
northwest
was
created,
it
had
a
net
worth
of
approximately
$575
million.
in
order
to
induce
the
pacific
shareholders
to
retain
their
proportionate
interest
in
pacific
in
the
form
of
northwest
stock,
the
price
at
which
the
stock
was
offered
was
fixed
at
approximately
40%
below
the
fair
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock.
these
rights
represented
in
effect,
part
of
the
equity
of
pacific
shareholders
since
20%
of
the
company
had
been
transferred
to
northwest,
and
the
rights
were
the
means
in
conformity
with
the
state
law
whereby
pacific
distributed
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
so
that
they
could
retain
their
equity
in
the
pacific
company.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
net
effect
is
to
increase
the
capital
of
pacific,
but
it
need
not
to
be
considered,
as
the
second
circuit
considered
it
from
a
tax
standpoint,
as
a
contribution
to
capital.
it
can
be
considered
as
i
will
develop
later
in
my
argument
as
simply
a
sale
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
because
of
a
sale
under
the
palmer
case
decided
30
years
ago
and
which
has
been
followed
by
the
commissioner
ever
since
a
sale
is
a
distribution.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor,
so
that
the
rights
or
the
means
whereby
the
northwest
stock
was
distributed
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
now,
the
opposing
views
of
the
commissioner
and
the
taxpayers
are
not
simply
that
the
transaction
involving
the
receipt
of
northwest
stock
is
tax-free
under
section
355.
much
of
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
is
addressed
to
the
proposition
that
the
receipt
of
the
northwest
stock,
through
the
rights
offerings,
is
not
governed
by
section
355,
but
the
solicitor
general
has
not
stated
what
it
is
and
what
the
commissioner
has
contended
resulted
to
the
receipt
of
the
stock.
and
it
might
be
pertinent
to
look
at
the
question,
which
was
so
properly
asked
by
the
second
circuit
judge
moore
--
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
275
and
turning
to
the
top
of
page
277,
pointing
to
the
fact
that
when
the
taxpayers
exercise
their
rights,
they
simply
receive
the
same
and
retain
the
same
equity
that
they
have
before,
only
they
have
two
pieces
of
paper,
certificates
in
pacific
and
northwest
instead
of
simply
certificates
in
pacific
representing
their
ownership
in
the
pacific
corporation.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
true,
but
the
payment
of
cash
into
the
corporation
should
not
be
a
vice
to
a
tax
and
i
will
advert
to
that
your
honor
if
i
may
in
pointing
to
the
question
raised
by
the
--
by
judge
moore
and
which
properly
was
raised.
as
i
have
stated,
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
when
pacific
decided
to
have
his
assets
held
by
two
corporations
instead
of
one,
the
taxpayer
simply
had
two
pieces
of
paper
instead
of
certificates
in
one
corporation.
and
the
question
is
asked,
“how
this
corporate
change
of
asset
ownership,
brought
income,
and
if
so,
where
is
it?”
here,
the
taxpayer
wound
up
with
the
same
equity,
they
paid
$16
a
share
in
the
pacific
and
the
commissioner
asserts
that
somehow
or
other,
they
received
a
dividend.
now
what
is
the
subject
of
the
dividend?
what
form
does
it
take?
the
commissioner
now
suggests
that
it
takes
the
form
of
the
rights
which
were
received
although
i
shall
deal
with
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
the
commissioner
had
ruled
that
the
subject
of
the
income,
the
distribution,
was
not
the
rights
but
was
a
stock
and
yet
the
stock
represented
to
retain
ownership
in
pacific.
these
rights
had
a
three-week
duration,
by
their
terms
they
expire,
they
are
worthless
after
three
weeks.
they
require
the
payment
of
cash
into
pacific
in
order
for
the
shareholders
of
pacific
to
retain
their
same
equity.
the
effect
of
the
commissioner's
determination
in
finding
that
this
transaction
resulted
in
income
is
to
hold
that
where
the
taxpayer
simply
paid
money
into
the
corporation
to
retain
their
same
equity
that
somehow
or
other,
they
received
the
income.
and
as
an
added
element
of
harshness,
the
commissioner
asserts
that
the
retention
of
this
equity
not
only
resulted
in
income,
but
resulted
in
ordinary
income,
a
dividend
income.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
when
the
rights
were
issued,
there
was
no
reduction
in
the
aggregated
net
worth
of
pacific.
there
was
no
distribution
of
property.
the
aggregate
property
and
net
worth
of
pacific
and
northwest
was
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
before
northwest
was
created.
the
payment
of
cash
by
the
pacific
shareholders
into
pacific
surely
should
not
result
in
income.
they
were
out
of
pocket
far
from
receiving
anything
from
the
corporation.
they
were
financially
out
of
pocket.
there
is
nothing
here
that
presents
an
occasion
for
the
imposition
of
the
tax
and
it
would
be
a
very
strange
thing
for
congress
to
provide
that
this
transaction
should
give
rise
to
income.
on
the
contrary,
our
position
is
that
section
355
properly
construed,
accords
the
receipt
of
the
northwest
stock
nonrecognition.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
would
have
to
be
a
profit
in
some
tangible
form
as
the
court
asked,
“where
is
it?
where
is
the
profit?”
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
cannot
be
a
profit
here
because
the
taxpayers
receive
nothing
more
than
what
they
have
before.
they
own
part
of
pacific
to
the
extent
that
they
exercise
their
rights.
they
have
the
same
equity,
only
they
have
the
equity
in
two
corporations
instead
of
one
and
this
is
precisely
what
section
355
was
intended
to
accomplish.
the
legislative
history
of
section
355
shows
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
facilitate
and
promote
the
breakup
of
large
corporations,
of
any
corporations,
so
that
they
could
be
reduced
to
smaller
business
units
under
altered
corporate
structures
although
owned
essentially
by
the
same
shareholders.
and
this
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
the
purpose
--
the
only
purpose
of
this
reorganization
was
to
divide
the
pacific
company
into
two
corporations
which
essentially
the
same
ownership.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
northwest
stock
represented
the
investment
of
the
shareholders
through
pacific,
and
the
assets
in
business
in
the
three
northwest
states.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
i
will
deal
with
that
your
honor.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
found
in
the
palmer
case
and
this
case
was
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government's
briefs,
the
palmer
case
dealt
with
the
nature
of
stock
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
palmer
case
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
issuance
of
stock
rights
gave
rise
to
a
dividend.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
under
a
different
statute,
but
essentially
the
same
language.
the
palmer
case
arose
under
the
1928
act
and
the
language,
despite
the
assertions
by
the
government
to
the
contrary,
the
language
of
the
dividend
distribution
section
in
the
1928
act
is
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes
as
the
language
in
301,
section
301,
which
is
the
dividend
distribution
section
relied
on
by
the
commissioner
in
the
1954
code.
now
in
the
palmer
case,
there
are
rights
issued
to
shareholders.
these
rights
had
a
value
at
the
time
they're
issued,
they
were
traded,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
receipt
of
those
rights
constituted
income.
the
commissioner
contended
before
this
court
that
rights
were
property
and
therefore,
when
the
corporation
issued
the
rights,
there
was
a
distribution
of
property,
and
therefore,
a
dividend.
the
supreme
court
held
this,
“rights
are
simply
offers.
there
is
no
distribution
of
property
when
rights
are
created”.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
is
no
reduction
in
the
corporate
property
or
net
worth.
and
a
dividend
involves
three
elements.
it
involves
a
distribution
of
property,
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
the
mere
fact
that
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
property
maybe
something
of
value.
when
the
corporation
declares
a
dividend,
the
right
to
that
dividend
is
property.
the
taxpayer
does
not
receive
a
dividend
until
the
dividend
is
paid.
there
is
no
dividend
in
the
sense
of
taxable
income
until
property
is
distributed.
and
in
the
palmer
case,
the
supreme
court
said
that
when
the
rights
are
issued
at
that
point,
there
is
no
distribution
because
there
is
no
transfer
of
corporate
property,
not
until
the
offer
is
accepted
by
exercising
the
rights.
is
there
a
transfer?
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
so.
and
that
is
our
position
here,
your
honor,
that
when
the
northwest
rights
were
issued,
there
was
no
distribution,
not
until
the
rights
were
exercised
was
there
a
distribution
and
the
distribution
then
took
the
form
of
the
northwest
stock,
because
in
the
exercise
of
rights,
the
rights
are
extinguished
and
the
property
transferred.
the
property
distributed
is
the
stock
which
is
subject
to
the
rights.
in
this
case,
the
northwest
stock
and
therefore
in
our
view
contrary
to
the
commissioner's
position,
there
was
a
distribution
solely
of
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
questions
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
that
can
be
most
easily
disposed
of
because
the
statute
does
not
say
distribute
it
to
all
of
the
shareholders
of
pacific
and
the
rights
were
issued
to
the
pacific
shareholders
as
shareholders.
as
shareholders,
they
exercise
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
correct.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
100%
of
the
stock
be
distributed
to
100%
of
the
shareholders.
the
statute
does
not
say
all
of
the
shareholders
and
that
provision
simply
is
a
provision
designed
to
ensure
continuity
of
interest
and
continuity
of
interest
as
the
court's
below
held
is
surely
taken
care
of
by
having
more
than
95%
of
the
rights
exercised
by
the
pacific
shareholders
to
whom
the
rights
were
issued.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
in
our
view,
it
could
make
a
difference,
but
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case
or
these
cases,
simply
this.
the
rights
were
a
mechanism
designed
to
affect
a
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock.
the
testimony
showed
that
a
rights
offering
would
be
successful
if
only
a
10%
under
pricing
were
used
if
the
rights
--
if
the
offering
price
was
only
10%
less
than
the
expected
fair
market
value
of
the
stock
subject
to
the
rights.
in
this
case,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
pacific
shareholders
would
retain
their
same
proportionate
interest
in
pacific
insofar
as
possible,
consistent
with
the
necessity
of
not
dipping
into
pacific's
surplus
so
that
pacific
could
conform
to
the
california
law.
the
price
at
which
the
northwest
stock
was
offered
was
40%
less
and
the
fact
that
the
under
pricing
was
successful
is
established
by
the
great
majority
of
the
shareholders
who
exercised
their
rights.
now
the
statement
was
made
that
approximately
one-third
of
the
minority
shareholders
did
not
exercise
their
rights.
the
record
shows
that
not
less
than
two-thirds
exercise
their
rights
and
a
large
number
of
rights
were
exercised
through
brokers
and
it
is
common
knowledge
that
stockholders
will
use
brokers
as
a
matter
of
convenience
in
the
exercise
of
rights.
so
a
great
many
of
the
rights
that
were
exercised
through
brokerage
firms,
we
believe,
were
exercised
by
pacific
shareholders,
but
in
response
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
stock
subject
to
the
rights
offer
and
the
offering
price
makes
a
difference,
conceivably
it
could,
but
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case
because
the
record
overwhelmingly
establishes
that
the
rights
mechanism
used
here
was
for
the
primary
purpose
of
getting
the
stock,
the
northwest
stock,
in
the
hands
of
the
pacific
shareholders.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes
your
honor.
that
portion
of
the
statute
to
which
you
have
referred
to
is
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d).
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
and
d
(1),
yes,
and
the
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
understood
was
directed
at
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
and
that
was
the
language
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
i
believe
that
he
was
addressing
his
remarks
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
requires
a
distribution
of
either
all
of
the
stock
of
the
controlled
corporation
or
at
least
80%
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
statute,
your
honor,
permits
retention
of
some
shares
as
long
as
these
shares
are
not
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoidance
of
federal
income
tax,
but
in
any
event,
it
is
our
position
that
all
of
the
shares
of
northwest
were
distributed.
now
the
point
with
respect
to
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
rights
were
not
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
rights
were
not
the
subject
to
the
distribution,
but
rather
the
stock,
but
all
of
the
stock
was
offered
to
the
pacific
shareholders
and
all
of
the
stock
was
thereby
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well
your
honor
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
--
the
rights
were
the
means
whereby
the
stock
was
distributed.
the
rights
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
they
exercised
their
rights
and
thereby
received
the
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
was
a
period
of
21
months
between
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
was
a
period
of
21
months
before
pacific
completed
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock.
now
with
respect
to
that
point,
in
the
tax
court,
no
contention
was
made
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
commissioner
then
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
are
two
elements
involved
in
this
contention.
one
is
the
factual
issue
as
to
whether
these
two
distributions
were
part
of
the
same
transaction
and
the
other
is
a
legal
issue
as
to
whether
the
statute
permits
more
than
one
distribution.
now
the
commissioner
apparently
has
abandoned
any
theory
which
was
contended,
and
i
think
properly
so,
that
the
statute
is
not
restricted
to
one
distribution.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
that
requires
that
there
be
only
one
distribution
of
all
the
stock
in
order
to
qualify
under
355.
now,
if
that
so,
then
the
mere
fact
that
there
were
two
distributions
is
not
a
violation
of
that
subsection.
turning
then
to
the
facts
as
just
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
this
is
a
matter
that
falls
within
the
province
of
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
so
found.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
oh!
i
think
your
inquiry
suggest
the
answer,
your
honor,
and
the
answer
i
think
is
clear
that
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
finding
for
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
made
a
finding.
the
tax
court
found
that
the
1961
and
the
1963
distributions
were
part
of
the
same
transaction.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
language
that
is
referred
to
in
the
taxpayers'
reply
brief
on
page
8.
and
there,
it
is
stated
in
the
plan,
the
pacific
company
shall
offer
to
its
shareholders
as
set
forth
below
the
right
to
purchase
all
of
the
shares
of
capital
stock
of
the
new
company
acquired
pursuant
to
this
plan.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
page
103,
your
honor,
in
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes.
the
plan
for
reorganization
which
was
submitted
to
the
shareholders
begins
on
page
102
of
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it's
not
contrary
to
it.
the
statement
on
page
109
relates
solely
to
the
maximum
period
of
time
during
which
it
was
anticipated
that
all
of
the
stock
would
be
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
at
the
bottom
of
103
and
the
top
of
104,
after
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
first
offering
would
be
approximately
56%,
the
statement
is
made
and
i
quote
the
bottom
page
103,
“at
a
time
or
times
related
to
its
need
for
a
new
capital,
the
company
will
offer
the
remainder
of
the
shares
of
the
new
company
for
sale
in
a
similar
manner
to
shareholders
of
the
company”.
and
similar
representations
were
made
in
the
registration
statement,
there
is
no
question
that
the
tax
court
so
found
that
all
of
the
shares
would
be
offered,
and
the
company
was
required
to
offer
all
the
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
pacific
was
not
in
the
position
to
charge
surplus
in
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock,
the
stock
had
to
be
offered
to
the
pacific
shareholders
at
more
than
its
book
value.
the
book
value
was
around
$13
a
share,
necessarily.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
actual
value
based
on
market
quotations,
your
honor,
was
in
excess
of
$26
a
share,
ranged
prices
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
a
relevant
fact
your
honor
and
it
reinforces
the
point
i
made
that
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
was
40%
greater
than
the
offering
price.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
to
affect
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders
to
provide
the
maximum
inducement
to
them
to
retain
their
equity
in
pacific.
now,
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
if
they
had
received
cash,
surely,
that
would
have
been
a
taxable
dividend.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
stock
represented
the
retention
of
their
equity
and
under
section
355,
congress
expressly
permitted,
provided
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
corporation
into
several
corporations
so
that
the
shareholders
could
receive
the
stock
of
the
new
corporations
tax
free
and
this
is
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
right
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
our
position
that
we
do
comply
and
the
suggestion
that
we
do
not
so
contend
is
not
--
it's
not
warranted.
we
contend
that
section
355
is
fully
complied
with.
our
case
revolves
around
the
interpretation
of
section
355
and
the
highly
technical
and
inhospitable
reading
to
quote
the
tax
court
which
the
commissioner
seeks
to
give
section
355,
engrafted
under
that
section
conditions
that
are
nowhere
expressed,
results
in
taxable
income
when
there
was
none
and
results
in
frustration
of
the
purposes
of
congress
rather
than
as
the
tax
court
pointed
out,
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
section
355.
section
355,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
conceded,
permitted
the
northwest
stock
to
be
distributed
tax-free
without
the
payment
of
any
cash.
it
was
stated
that
if
that
had
been
done,
section
355
clearly
would
have
been
complied
with.
the
position
of
the
commissioner
is
that
simply
because
the
taxpayers
paid
money
into
pacific
instead
of
receiving
the
northwest
stock
without
any
payment
that
thereby
they
incurred
a
tax.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
such
a
distribution
would
have
had
to
be
charged
to
surplus
and
pacific
did
not
have
sufficient
surplus
to
permit
a
distribution
in
that
manner.
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
california
law
and
pacific
was
so
advised.
therefore,
when
in
conformity
with
the
california
corporation
law,
the
stock
rights
method
was
used
in
order
to
avoid
charging
surplus,
the
offering
price
was
fixed
at
an
amount
in
excess
of
book
value.
now
necessarily,
that
figure
involved
the
payment
into
pacific
of
very,
very
large
sums
of
money.
the
total
amount
paid
in
under
the
rights
offerings
was
approximately
$480
million.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
rights
offerings
would
involve
such
a
large
inflow
of
capital,
it
was
necessary
to
take
cognizance
of
that
and
not
raise
capital
as
pacific
had
customarily
by
issuing
its
own
securities.
it
was
--
pacific
then
was
requiring
about
$250
million
a
year
and
prior
to
1961,
it
had
been
issuing
its
own
securities,
its
own
debentures
and
its
own
stock
in
order
to
raise
capital.
but
because
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock
in
conformity
with
the
california
law
required
the
payment
of
capital
into
pacific,
it
was
unnecessary
for
pacific
during
this
interim
period
to
resort
to
issuance
of
its
own
securities
to
raise
capital.
and
necessarily,
because
pacific
was
a
public
utility,
it
could
not
have
on
hand
properly
large
sums
of
unused
capital.
in
the
interest
of
the
shareholders
and
the
ratepayers,
it
would
have
been
improper
for
pacific
to
have
a
large
amount
of
unused
cash,
lying
in
the
banks
and
yielding
a
low
rate
of
return.
now,
i
have
dealt
with
the
palmer
case
and
i
think
it
might
be
pertinent
here
to
talk
about
the
--
whether
or
not
the
1954
code
changed
the
rule
in
that
case.
as
i
said,
that
rule
was
accepted
by
the
commissioner.
it's
embodied
in
a
general
counsel's
memorandum.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
administrative
practice
of
the
commissioner
for
30
years
has
been
to
follow
the
palmer
case,
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
income,
no
distribution
when
rights
are
issued,
that
when
the
rights
are
exercised,
that's
when
the
distribution
takes
place.
in
fact,
in
the
rulings
that
were
issued
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases,
the
commissioner
applied
the
palmer
doctrine.
the
commissioners
rulings
sated
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
property.
the
property
was
in
the
form
of
a
northwest
stock
and
the
commissioner
further
said
that
the
receipt
of
rights
was
not
taxable
income.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
commissioner's
theory
here
before
this
court
is
not
only
contrary
to
his
long-established
administrative
practice,
but
it's
contrary
to
the
rulings
that
he
expressively
made
in
the
--
in
connection
with
this
reorganization.
now,
as
to
the
1954
code,
the
commissioner
relies
on
a
change
in
the
definition
of
property,
and
the
contention
made
is
that
rights
are
therefore
property
and
when
they're
issued,
there
is
a
distribution
of
a
dividend.
well,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
palmer
case
turns
not
on
the
concept
of
property.
it
turns
on
the
concept
of
what
is
a
distribution
and
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
1954
code
in
language
of
the
statute
dealing
with
distributions
of
property
as
dividends.
not
only
there
was
a
no
change
in
that
language,
but
congress,
in
the
committee
reports
stated
that
section
301
which
embodies
this
language
substantially
was
the
same
as
the
corresponding
provisions
in
the
prior
law
which
were
involved
in
the
palmer
case.
there
is
no
indication
whatever
in
any
of
the
committee
reports
that
congress
ever
made
any
change
in
this
important
rule,
in
this
backhanded
fashion
by
simply
dealing
with
what
i
consider
was
a
drafting
clarification
in
the
definition
of
property
and
we've
explained
that
in
our
brief.
it's
a
highly
tactical
point,
but
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
the
assertion
that
congress
intended
to
make
any
change
in
the
1954
code
with
respect
to
the
palmer
rule.
and
after
palmer
case
is
applied,
there
is
a
distribution
because
palmer
said
that
a
sale
of
property
to
shareholders
of
a
corporation
is
in
a
literal
sense,
a
distribution.
there
is
also
a
distribution
solely
of
stock
because
the
subject
to
the
distribution
is
not
the
rights,
but
a
northwest
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
distribution
but
it
does
not
involve
any
distribution
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
there
are
three
elements.
there
clearly
is
a
distribution
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
transfer
of
corporate
property
to
the
shareholders
and
that's
the
sense
in
which
the
word
--
the
term
distribution
is
used
in
section
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
i
am
questioning,
because
it
is
our
position
that
if
this
transaction
does
not
fit
under
section
355,
it
fits
under
some
other
reorganization
provision
or
in
any
event
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it
would
be
a
taxable
transaction
and
a
taxable
distribution,
your
honor,
but
it
maybe
either
an
ordinary
dividend
or
it
may
be
a
distribution
and
partial
liquidation.
in
our
contention,
one
of
our
alternative
contentions
here
is
that
because
the
northwest
stock
represented
20%
of
the
assets
of
the
pacific
company
before
northwest
was
created
that
if
there
is
any
taxable
distribution,
it
is
a
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
it
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
it
was
an
alternative
contention
which
was
not
considered
by
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
found
that
there
was
no
taxable
distribution.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor,
but
it's
a
very
compelling
factor
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
--
in
finding
that
the
purpose
and
the
fact
of
the
reorganization
fits
under
section
355
because
section
355
was
designed
to
accomplish
just
that,
to
permit
one
corporation
to
be
divided
into
two
corporations
or
more
with
essentially
the
same
ownership
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
pacific
shareholders
wound
up
with
certificates
in
two
corporations
instead
of
one,
there
is
just
simply
a
change
in
the
corporate
structures.
we've
had
some
discussion
on
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
and
i
believe
that
the
issue
there
is
controlled
by
the
clear
finding
of
the
tax
court
which
is
clearly
supported
by
the
record
and
this
finding
is
not
supported
only
by
the
documents,
the
representations
that
were
made
by
the
shareholders
in
the
filings
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
were
subject
to
all
the
civil
and
criminal
penalties,
if
there
are
any
material
misrepresentations
of
fact,
but
it's
also
supported
by
the
unequivocal
testimony
of
the
controller
and
the
vice
president
of
pacific.
he
testified
that
the
1963
offering
and
the
1961
offering
of
the
northwest
stock
were
interdependent.
neither
step
would
have
been
taken
without
the
other
and
the
court
found
that
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
transaction
looking
toward
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock
by
pacific.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
american
filed
a
consolidated
return
but
the
absence
of
a
dividend
income
is
predicated
on
the
ruling
that
the
subject
of
the
distribution
was
the
northwest
stock
and
the
commissioner
ruled
that
if
the
basis
of
the
northwest
stock
was
less
than
the
offering
price
and
then
in
the
case
of
corporate
shareholder
of
pacific,
there
would
be
no
dividend
and
american,
like
all
the
other
corporate
shareholders
of
pacific
under
the
commissioner's
ruling,
are
deemed
not
to
have
received
dividend
income.
but
under
the
theory,
the
new
theory,
that
the
commissioner
has
expounded
here,
that
the
rights
are
taxable
income
when
received,
there
still
is
no
income
for
the
corporate
shareholders
because
corporate
shareholders
are
treated
differently
than
individual
shareholders
in
respect
with
dividends
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
consolidated
return
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
the
receipt
of
income
through
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
i
might
say
this
that
i
was
somewhat
startled
to
find
in
the
commissioner's
brief
the
espousal
of
the
theory
of
convenience,
the
rule
of
convenience
in
connection
with
determining
tax
liability.
when
the
commissioner
issued
his
rulings,
he
said
the
taxable
event
was
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
now,
the
position
is
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
receipt
of
the
rights.
when
he
ruled
that
the
exercise
event
was
--
gave
rise
to
the
tax,
the
measure
of
the
tax
was
the
difference
in
the
commissioner's
view
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
stock
at
the
time
of
exercise
and
the
offering
price.
now
the
commissioner
asserts
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
receipt
of
the
rights
and
that
while
analytically
speaking,
the
amount
of
the
income
is
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
time
of
receipt,
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
“convenience,”
the
taxable
income
maybe
determined
by
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
stock
and
the
offering
price
at
the
date
of
exercise.
now
i
submit
your
honor
that
--
submit
to
this
court
that
tax
liability
could
not
be
predicated
on
such
flexible
rules.
the
taxable
event
is
either
the
exercised
dates
or
it's
the
receipt
date
or
no
rules
of
convenience
can
be
permitted
simply
because
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
not
much
difference
in
dollar
amount
between
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
date
of
exercise
and
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
date
of
receipt.
there
must
be
one
rule
of
taxation
that
applies
to
all
taxpayers.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
the
commissioner
has
taken
a
position
that
as
a
matter
of
computational
convenience,
the
commissioner
could
determine
properly
that
the
measure
of
income
was
the
value
at
the
date
of
exercise.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
the
rule
of
construction
to
be
applied
here.
the
rule
of
construction
which
the
taxpayers
are
contending
for
is
not
a
so
called
liberal
construction.
our
contention
is
the
statute
must
be
applied
as
it
reads
section
355
is
in
the
context
of
the
reorganization
provisions.
it
is
part
of
subchapter
c
dealing
with
all
types
of
reorganizations
not
merely
the
device
of
reorganizations
that
are
embraced
within
the
section
355.
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
that
in
connection
with
section
355,
congress
wished
to
do
a
way
with
forms
in
corporate
mechanics
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
device
of
reorganization
would
be
treated
as
tax
free.
it
wanted
to
deal
with
the
substance.
the
effect
of
transactions
and
the
reason
for
it
is
because
of
the
history
of
the
spin-off,
so
called
spin-off
provisions
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
use
the
tax
jargon
here
which
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
which
occurred
in
the
gregory
case.
now
this
case
is
the
antithesis
of
the
gregory
case.
in
the
gregory
case,
the
taxpayer
used
a
form
of
spin-off
in
order
to
affect
what
was
essentially
a
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits.
it
was
a
tax
avoidance
scheme
pure
and
simple
that
followed
the
form
of
the
statute,
but
the
substance
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
congress
intended.
therefore,
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
spin-off
provisions
could
be
abused,
in
1934,
the
congress
did
away
with
a
spin-off
provision
but
it
retained
all
of
the
other
device
of
reorganization,
the
split-ups
and
the
split-off.
and
the
reason
is
clear
because
the
congress
at
all
times
evinced
the
policy
of
encouraging
the
division
and
the
breaking
up
of
corporations,
rearrangement
of
corporate
structures
with
essentially
the
same
ownership.
therefore,
it
was
impelled
to
reinstate
the
spin-off
provision
in
1951,
but
it
did
not
reinstate
it
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
put
in
1924
when
the
gregory
case
and
all
of
that
litigation
arose.
there
was
a
qualification
in
the
statute
as
it
stood
in
1951
which
showed
clearly
that
congress
did
not
want
the
spin-off
provisions
to
be
abused
by
using
that
form
of
device
of
reorganization
as
a
means
the
getting
earnings
and
profits
out
of
the
corporation.
therefore
in
1954,
when
there
was
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
code,
a
reexamination
of
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
code
and
in
particular
the
corporate
reorganization
provisions,
congress
placed
the
emphasis
on
substance
and
not
form.
and
in
one
section,
section
355,
it
dealt
with
all
types
of
device
of
reorganizations
and
it
said
regardless
of
the
mechanics,
the
forms,
the
corporate
forms
used
whether
it's
a
spin-off
or
a
split-off
or
a
split-up,
as
long
as
in
substance,
there
was
no
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits
then
that
change
of
corporate
ownership,
change
in
corporate
structure
on
their
audit
form
would
be
permitted
to
take
place
on
a
tax-free
basis.
the
purpose
of
congress,
i
think,
in
doing
that
is
well
set
out
in
the
committee
report.
the
committee
report
is
referred
to
in
the
commissioner's
brief
on
page
2
of
his
reply,
but
unfortunately,
he
has
omitted
from
the
text
which
is
quoted,
the
entire
language
which
shows
clearly
that
congress
wished
to
be
exceedingly
liberal
with
respect
to
readjustments
and
rearrangements
of
corporate
structure
but
to
tighten
up
on
the
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits
so
that
the
substance,
the
effect
of
the
transactions
would
control.
the
full
text
of
that
statement
in
the
committee
report
which
i
have
referred
to
appears
in
the
taxpayers'
brief
on
pages
33
and
34
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
statement
in
that
report
that
i
think
is
pertinent
here,
“thus,
your
committee
would
liberalize
present
law
with
respect
to
the
non-recognition
of
gain
or
loss
in
cases
which
involved
mere
rearrangements
of
the
corporate
structure
while
at
the
same
time,
providing
less
liberal
rules
in
other
areas
in
order
to
ensure
that
transactions
which
are
in
substance,
although
not
in
form,
dividend
distributions
by
corporations
to
their
shareholders
are
subject
to
tax
at
ordinary
income
rather
than
a
capital
gain
rates”.
now
what
do
we
have
here?
we
have
precisely
what
the
committee
was
dealing
with,
the
rearrangement
of
corporate
structures
with
essentially
the
same
ownership
and
this,
the
statute
was
designed
to
permit
to
be
accomplished
on
a
tax-free
basis.
the
changes
that
were
made
in
the
prior
law
by
the
1954
code
through
section
355
are
set
out
in
the
brief
of
the
taxpayers,
the
opening
brief
on
pages
34
and
35,
and
they
show
clearly
that
congress
in
dealing
away
with
a
necessity
for
pro
rata
distributions
and
making
it
unnecessary
to
form
a
holding
company
which
would
take
over
the
stock
of
a
controlled
corporation
and
be
the
subject
of
a
tax
free
spin-off.
congress
was
concerned
with
eliminating
all
of
these
corporate
mechanics,
but
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
use
of
section
355
to
distribute
earnings
and
profits
in
the
four
conditions
two
of
which
had
been
relied
on
by
the
commissioner
here.
the
four
conditions
in
section
355
are
all
designed
to
implement
this
overall
concern
of
congress
that
there'd
be
no
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits.
now
when
the
taxpayers
exercise
their
rights,
when
the
pacific
shareholders
exercise
their
rights,
what
happens?
was
there
any
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits?
assuredly
not
because
all
of
the
property
and
net
worth
that
had
been
in
pacific
was
then
in
two
corporations,
pacific
and
northwest
and
was
still
available
for
distribution
of
dividends
to
be
taxed
when
as
and
if
distributed,
but
not
until
then.
now,
turning
to
the
precise
language
of
355
(a)
(1)
(a),
taking
that
language
as
it
should
be
read
in
its
ordinary
meaning
and
in
the
context
in
which
the
section
appears,
it
is
our
contention
that
we
meet
all
of
the
conditions
prescribed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(a),
a
corporation
referred
to
in
this
section
as
a
distributing
corporation
distributes.
assuredly
there
was
a
distribution
here
under
the
palmer
case,
the
transfer
of
corporate
property
to
a
shareholder
is
a
distribution
even
though
it
might
be
called
a
sale.
as
the
palmer
case
says,
a
sale
literally
is
a
distribution.
and
the
language
is
precisely
the
same
in
section
301
which
seemingly
the
commissioner
agrees,
includes
a
so
called
sale
or
on
pages
6
and
7,
the
reply
brief
of
the
commissioner,
the
statement
is
made
and
i
quote,
“there
is
such
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock
only
when
the
sale
is
a
bargain,
the
price
is
less
than
value”.
in
that
circumstance
which
is
the
present
case,
the
item
distributed
is
the
value
of
the
bargain
measured
by
the
spread
between
the
price
and
the
value.
it
is
submitted
that
what
is
distributed
is
not
an
item
of
value.
what
is
distributed
is
property
and
the
property
that
was
distributed
here
was
the
northwest
stock.
with
respect
to
its
stock,
as
our
brief
shows
clearly,
means
simply
the
recognition
of
the
shareholders
in
their
capacity
as
such
and
nothing
more.
we
believe
that
we
complied
in
every
way
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
section
355.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
here.
one
issue
arises
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
northwest
rights.
the
other
issue
relates
to
the
sale
of
the
northwest
rights.
the
solicitor
general
misspoke
in
referring
to
the
sale
issue
as
arising
in
the
bann
case.
actually,
it
arose
in
the
gordon
case
and
the
bann
case
involves
only
the
exercise
of
rights
issue,
the
same
issue
that
is
involved
in
the
gordon
case.
addressing
myself
first
to
the
exercise
issue,
i
should
like
to
review
briefly
the
facts
giving
rise
to
the
reorganization
that
is
in
question
here.
pacific
operated
the
telephone
business
in
the
four
western
states,
california,
washington,
oregon
and
idaho
prior
to
july
1,
1961.
this
territory
experienced
enormous
growth
in
the
post-war
period,
so
much
so
that
it
was
apparent
that
extreme
administrative
difficulties
were
being
generated
by
the
expansion
which
was
taking
place.
the
company
therefore
undertook
a
study
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
desirable
to
divide
pacific
into
two
or
more
corporations
and
this
study
took
place
over
a
period
of
about
two
years,
which
begun
in
1958.
the
result
of
the
study
was
that
it
was
desirable
to
divide
the
business
of
pacific
into
two
corporations,
one
which
would
have
all
of
the
business
and
assets
in
the
three
northwest
states,
and
the
other
the
remaining
operations
in
california.
the
reasons
for
the
division
were
to
have
a
management
and
a
board
drawn
from
the
area
served
so
that
there
would
be
a
better
understanding
of
the
service
needs,
so
that
there
would
be
better
relations
with
customers,
employees,
and
government
officials.
the
plan
to
divide
the
pacific
company
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
devising
a
means
of
raising
capital.
based
on
this
study,
it
was
determined
to
proceed
with
the
division
of
the
pacific
company.
the
most
obvious
way
of
affecting
this
division
would
be
by
transferring
all
of
the
assets
and
business
in
the
three
northwest
states
to
a
new
corporation,
and
then
simply
distributing
the
stock
of
that
corporation
pro
rata
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
such
a
distribution
would
have
taken
the
form
of
a
dividend
and
would
have
had
to
be
charged
to
the
earned
surplus
of
pacific.
pacific
did
not
have
sufficient
surplus
for
this
purpose.
accordingly,
counsel
for
the
company
advised
pacific
management
that
under
the
california
law,
it
could
not
create
northwest
and
distribute
the
northwest
stock
directly
to
the
pacific
shareholders
without
the
payment
of
any
consideration.
the
plan
then
devised
in
conformity
with
the
california
law
was
to
affect
a
distribution
of
a
northwest
stock
by
rights
offerings.
the
northwest
assets
represented
about
20%
of
pacific's
business
and
when
northwest
was
created,
it
had
a
net
worth
of
approximately
$575
million.
in
order
to
induce
the
pacific
shareholders
to
retain
their
proportionate
interest
in
pacific
in
the
form
of
northwest
stock,
the
price
at
which
the
stock
was
offered
was
fixed
at
approximately
40%
below
the
fair
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock.
these
rights
represented
in
effect,
part
of
the
equity
of
pacific
shareholders
since
20%
of
the
company
had
been
transferred
to
northwest,
and
the
rights
were
the
means
in
conformity
with
the
state
law
whereby
pacific
distributed
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
so
that
they
could
retain
their
equity
in
the
pacific
company.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
net
effect
is
to
increase
the
capital
of
pacific,
but
it
need
not
to
be
considered,
as
the
second
circuit
considered
it
from
a
tax
standpoint,
as
a
contribution
to
capital.
it
can
be
considered
as
i
will
develop
later
in
my
argument
as
simply
a
sale
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
because
of
a
sale
under
the
palmer
case
decided
30
years
ago
and
which
has
been
followed
by
the
commissioner
ever
since
a
sale
is
a
distribution.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor,
so
that
the
rights
or
the
means
whereby
the
northwest
stock
was
distributed
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
now,
the
opposing
views
of
the
commissioner
and
the
taxpayers
are
not
simply
that
the
transaction
involving
the
receipt
of
northwest
stock
is
tax-free
under
section
355.
much
of
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
is
addressed
to
the
proposition
that
the
receipt
of
the
northwest
stock,
through
the
rights
offerings,
is
not
governed
by
section
355,
but
the
solicitor
general
has
not
stated
what
it
is
and
what
the
commissioner
has
contended
resulted
to
the
receipt
of
the
stock.
and
it
might
be
pertinent
to
look
at
the
question,
which
was
so
properly
asked
by
the
second
circuit
judge
moore
--
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
275
and
turning
to
the
top
of
page
277,
pointing
to
the
fact
that
when
the
taxpayers
exercise
their
rights,
they
simply
receive
the
same
and
retain
the
same
equity
that
they
have
before,
only
they
have
two
pieces
of
paper,
certificates
in
pacific
and
northwest
instead
of
simply
certificates
in
pacific
representing
their
ownership
in
the
pacific
corporation.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
true,
but
the
payment
of
cash
into
the
corporation
should
not
be
a
vice
to
a
tax
and
i
will
advert
to
that
your
honor
if
i
may
in
pointing
to
the
question
raised
by
the
--
by
judge
moore
and
which
properly
was
raised.
as
i
have
stated,
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
when
pacific
decided
to
have
his
assets
held
by
two
corporations
instead
of
one,
the
taxpayer
simply
had
two
pieces
of
paper
instead
of
certificates
in
one
corporation.
and
the
question
is
asked,
“how
this
corporate
change
of
asset
ownership,
brought
income,
and
if
so,
where
is
it?”
here,
the
taxpayer
wound
up
with
the
same
equity,
they
paid
$16
a
share
in
the
pacific
and
the
commissioner
asserts
that
somehow
or
other,
they
received
a
dividend.
now
what
is
the
subject
of
the
dividend?
what
form
does
it
take?
the
commissioner
now
suggests
that
it
takes
the
form
of
the
rights
which
were
received
although
i
shall
deal
with
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
the
commissioner
had
ruled
that
the
subject
of
the
income,
the
distribution,
was
not
the
rights
but
was
a
stock
and
yet
the
stock
represented
to
retain
ownership
in
pacific.
these
rights
had
a
three-week
duration,
by
their
terms
they
expire,
they
are
worthless
after
three
weeks.
they
require
the
payment
of
cash
into
pacific
in
order
for
the
shareholders
of
pacific
to
retain
their
same
equity.
the
effect
of
the
commissioner's
determination
in
finding
that
this
transaction
resulted
in
income
is
to
hold
that
where
the
taxpayer
simply
paid
money
into
the
corporation
to
retain
their
same
equity
that
somehow
or
other,
they
received
the
income.
and
as
an
added
element
of
harshness,
the
commissioner
asserts
that
the
retention
of
this
equity
not
only
resulted
in
income,
but
resulted
in
ordinary
income,
a
dividend
income.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
when
the
rights
were
issued,
there
was
no
reduction
in
the
aggregated
net
worth
of
pacific.
there
was
no
distribution
of
property.
the
aggregate
property
and
net
worth
of
pacific
and
northwest
was
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
before
northwest
was
created.
the
payment
of
cash
by
the
pacific
shareholders
into
pacific
surely
should
not
result
in
income.
they
were
out
of
pocket
far
from
receiving
anything
from
the
corporation.
they
were
financially
out
of
pocket.
there
is
nothing
here
that
presents
an
occasion
for
the
imposition
of
the
tax
and
it
would
be
a
very
strange
thing
for
congress
to
provide
that
this
transaction
should
give
rise
to
income.
on
the
contrary,
our
position
is
that
section
355
properly
construed,
accords
the
receipt
of
the
northwest
stock
nonrecognition.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
would
have
to
be
a
profit
in
some
tangible
form
as
the
court
asked,
“where
is
it?
where
is
the
profit?”
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
cannot
be
a
profit
here
because
the
taxpayers
receive
nothing
more
than
what
they
have
before.
they
own
part
of
pacific
to
the
extent
that
they
exercise
their
rights.
they
have
the
same
equity,
only
they
have
the
equity
in
two
corporations
instead
of
one
and
this
is
precisely
what
section
355
was
intended
to
accomplish.
the
legislative
history
of
section
355
shows
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
facilitate
and
promote
the
breakup
of
large
corporations,
of
any
corporations,
so
that
they
could
be
reduced
to
smaller
business
units
under
altered
corporate
structures
although
owned
essentially
by
the
same
shareholders.
and
this
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
the
purpose
--
the
only
purpose
of
this
reorganization
was
to
divide
the
pacific
company
into
two
corporations
which
essentially
the
same
ownership.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
northwest
stock
represented
the
investment
of
the
shareholders
through
pacific,
and
the
assets
in
business
in
the
three
northwest
states.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
i
will
deal
with
that
your
honor.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
found
in
the
palmer
case
and
this
case
was
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government's
briefs,
the
palmer
case
dealt
with
the
nature
of
stock
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
palmer
case
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
issuance
of
stock
rights
gave
rise
to
a
dividend.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
under
a
different
statute,
but
essentially
the
same
language.
the
palmer
case
arose
under
the
1928
act
and
the
language,
despite
the
assertions
by
the
government
to
the
contrary,
the
language
of
the
dividend
distribution
section
in
the
1928
act
is
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes
as
the
language
in
301,
section
301,
which
is
the
dividend
distribution
section
relied
on
by
the
commissioner
in
the
1954
code.
now
in
the
palmer
case,
there
are
rights
issued
to
shareholders.
these
rights
had
a
value
at
the
time
they're
issued,
they
were
traded,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
receipt
of
those
rights
constituted
income.
the
commissioner
contended
before
this
court
that
rights
were
property
and
therefore,
when
the
corporation
issued
the
rights,
there
was
a
distribution
of
property,
and
therefore,
a
dividend.
the
supreme
court
held
this,
“rights
are
simply
offers.
there
is
no
distribution
of
property
when
rights
are
created”.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
is
no
reduction
in
the
corporate
property
or
net
worth.
and
a
dividend
involves
three
elements.
it
involves
a
distribution
of
property,
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
the
mere
fact
that
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
property
maybe
something
of
value.
when
the
corporation
declares
a
dividend,
the
right
to
that
dividend
is
property.
the
taxpayer
does
not
receive
a
dividend
until
the
dividend
is
paid.
there
is
no
dividend
in
the
sense
of
taxable
income
until
property
is
distributed.
and
in
the
palmer
case,
the
supreme
court
said
that
when
the
rights
are
issued
at
that
point,
there
is
no
distribution
because
there
is
no
transfer
of
corporate
property,
not
until
the
offer
is
accepted
by
exercising
the
rights.
is
there
a
transfer?
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
so.
and
that
is
our
position
here,
your
honor,
that
when
the
northwest
rights
were
issued,
there
was
no
distribution,
not
until
the
rights
were
exercised
was
there
a
distribution
and
the
distribution
then
took
the
form
of
the
northwest
stock,
because
in
the
exercise
of
rights,
the
rights
are
extinguished
and
the
property
transferred.
the
property
distributed
is
the
stock
which
is
subject
to
the
rights.
in
this
case,
the
northwest
stock
and
therefore
in
our
view
contrary
to
the
commissioner's
position,
there
was
a
distribution
solely
of
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
questions
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
that
can
be
most
easily
disposed
of
because
the
statute
does
not
say
distribute
it
to
all
of
the
shareholders
of
pacific
and
the
rights
were
issued
to
the
pacific
shareholders
as
shareholders.
as
shareholders,
they
exercise
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
correct.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
100%
of
the
stock
be
distributed
to
100%
of
the
shareholders.
the
statute
does
not
say
all
of
the
shareholders
and
that
provision
simply
is
a
provision
designed
to
ensure
continuity
of
interest
and
continuity
of
interest
as
the
court's
below
held
is
surely
taken
care
of
by
having
more
than
95%
of
the
rights
exercised
by
the
pacific
shareholders
to
whom
the
rights
were
issued.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
in
our
view,
it
could
make
a
difference,
but
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case
or
these
cases,
simply
this.
the
rights
were
a
mechanism
designed
to
affect
a
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock.
the
testimony
showed
that
a
rights
offering
would
be
successful
if
only
a
10%
under
pricing
were
used
if
the
rights
--
if
the
offering
price
was
only
10%
less
than
the
expected
fair
market
value
of
the
stock
subject
to
the
rights.
in
this
case,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
pacific
shareholders
would
retain
their
same
proportionate
interest
in
pacific
insofar
as
possible,
consistent
with
the
necessity
of
not
dipping
into
pacific's
surplus
so
that
pacific
could
conform
to
the
california
law.
the
price
at
which
the
northwest
stock
was
offered
was
40%
less
and
the
fact
that
the
under
pricing
was
successful
is
established
by
the
great
majority
of
the
shareholders
who
exercised
their
rights.
now
the
statement
was
made
that
approximately
one-third
of
the
minority
shareholders
did
not
exercise
their
rights.
the
record
shows
that
not
less
than
two-thirds
exercise
their
rights
and
a
large
number
of
rights
were
exercised
through
brokers
and
it
is
common
knowledge
that
stockholders
will
use
brokers
as
a
matter
of
convenience
in
the
exercise
of
rights.
so
a
great
many
of
the
rights
that
were
exercised
through
brokerage
firms,
we
believe,
were
exercised
by
pacific
shareholders,
but
in
response
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
stock
subject
to
the
rights
offer
and
the
offering
price
makes
a
difference,
conceivably
it
could,
but
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case
because
the
record
overwhelmingly
establishes
that
the
rights
mechanism
used
here
was
for
the
primary
purpose
of
getting
the
stock,
the
northwest
stock,
in
the
hands
of
the
pacific
shareholders.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes
your
honor.
that
portion
of
the
statute
to
which
you
have
referred
to
is
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d).
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
and
d
(1),
yes,
and
the
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
understood
was
directed
at
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
and
that
was
the
language
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
i
believe
that
he
was
addressing
his
remarks
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
requires
a
distribution
of
either
all
of
the
stock
of
the
controlled
corporation
or
at
least
80%
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
statute,
your
honor,
permits
retention
of
some
shares
as
long
as
these
shares
are
not
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoidance
of
federal
income
tax,
but
in
any
event,
it
is
our
position
that
all
of
the
shares
of
northwest
were
distributed.
now
the
point
with
respect
to
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
rights
were
not
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
rights
were
not
the
subject
to
the
distribution,
but
rather
the
stock,
but
all
of
the
stock
was
offered
to
the
pacific
shareholders
and
all
of
the
stock
was
thereby
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
well
your
honor
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
--
the
rights
were
the
means
whereby
the
stock
was
distributed.
the
rights
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
they
exercised
their
rights
and
thereby
received
the
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
was
a
period
of
21
months
between
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
was
a
period
of
21
months
before
pacific
completed
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock.
now
with
respect
to
that
point,
in
the
tax
court,
no
contention
was
made
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
commissioner
then
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
there
are
two
elements
involved
in
this
contention.
one
is
the
factual
issue
as
to
whether
these
two
distributions
were
part
of
the
same
transaction
and
the
other
is
a
legal
issue
as
to
whether
the
statute
permits
more
than
one
distribution.
now
the
commissioner
apparently
has
abandoned
any
theory
which
was
contended,
and
i
think
properly
so,
that
the
statute
is
not
restricted
to
one
distribution.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
that
requires
that
there
be
only
one
distribution
of
all
the
stock
in
order
to
qualify
under
355.
now,
if
that
so,
then
the
mere
fact
that
there
were
two
distributions
is
not
a
violation
of
that
subsection.
turning
then
to
the
facts
as
just
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
this
is
a
matter
that
falls
within
the
province
of
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
so
found.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
oh!
i
think
your
inquiry
suggest
the
answer,
your
honor,
and
the
answer
i
think
is
clear
that
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
finding
for
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
made
a
finding.
the
tax
court
found
that
the
1961
and
the
1963
distributions
were
part
of
the
same
transaction.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
language
that
is
referred
to
in
the
taxpayers'
reply
brief
on
page
8.
and
there,
it
is
stated
in
the
plan,
the
pacific
company
shall
offer
to
its
shareholders
as
set
forth
below
the
right
to
purchase
all
of
the
shares
of
capital
stock
of
the
new
company
acquired
pursuant
to
this
plan.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
page
103,
your
honor,
in
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes.
the
plan
for
reorganization
which
was
submitted
to
the
shareholders
begins
on
page
102
of
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it's
not
contrary
to
it.
the
statement
on
page
109
relates
solely
to
the
maximum
period
of
time
during
which
it
was
anticipated
that
all
of
the
stock
would
be
distributed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
at
the
bottom
of
103
and
the
top
of
104,
after
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
first
offering
would
be
approximately
56%,
the
statement
is
made
and
i
quote
the
bottom
page
103,
“at
a
time
or
times
related
to
its
need
for
a
new
capital,
the
company
will
offer
the
remainder
of
the
shares
of
the
new
company
for
sale
in
a
similar
manner
to
shareholders
of
the
company”.
and
similar
representations
were
made
in
the
registration
statement,
there
is
no
question
that
the
tax
court
so
found
that
all
of
the
shares
would
be
offered,
and
the
company
was
required
to
offer
all
the
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
pacific
was
not
in
the
position
to
charge
surplus
in
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock,
the
stock
had
to
be
offered
to
the
pacific
shareholders
at
more
than
its
book
value.
the
book
value
was
around
$13
a
share,
necessarily.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
actual
value
based
on
market
quotations,
your
honor,
was
in
excess
of
$26
a
share,
ranged
prices
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
a
relevant
fact
your
honor
and
it
reinforces
the
point
i
made
that
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
was
40%
greater
than
the
offering
price.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
to
affect
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders
to
provide
the
maximum
inducement
to
them
to
retain
their
equity
in
pacific.
now,
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
if
they
had
received
cash,
surely,
that
would
have
been
a
taxable
dividend.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
stock
represented
the
retention
of
their
equity
and
under
section
355,
congress
expressly
permitted,
provided
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
corporation
into
several
corporations
so
that
the
shareholders
could
receive
the
stock
of
the
new
corporations
tax
free
and
this
is
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
right
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
that
is
our
position
that
we
do
comply
and
the
suggestion
that
we
do
not
so
contend
is
not
--
it's
not
warranted.
we
contend
that
section
355
is
fully
complied
with.
our
case
revolves
around
the
interpretation
of
section
355
and
the
highly
technical
and
inhospitable
reading
to
quote
the
tax
court
which
the
commissioner
seeks
to
give
section
355,
engrafted
under
that
section
conditions
that
are
nowhere
expressed,
results
in
taxable
income
when
there
was
none
and
results
in
frustration
of
the
purposes
of
congress
rather
than
as
the
tax
court
pointed
out,
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
section
355.
section
355,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
conceded,
permitted
the
northwest
stock
to
be
distributed
tax-free
without
the
payment
of
any
cash.
it
was
stated
that
if
that
had
been
done,
section
355
clearly
would
have
been
complied
with.
the
position
of
the
commissioner
is
that
simply
because
the
taxpayers
paid
money
into
pacific
instead
of
receiving
the
northwest
stock
without
any
payment
that
thereby
they
incurred
a
tax.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
such
a
distribution
would
have
had
to
be
charged
to
surplus
and
pacific
did
not
have
sufficient
surplus
to
permit
a
distribution
in
that
manner.
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
california
law
and
pacific
was
so
advised.
therefore,
when
in
conformity
with
the
california
corporation
law,
the
stock
rights
method
was
used
in
order
to
avoid
charging
surplus,
the
offering
price
was
fixed
at
an
amount
in
excess
of
book
value.
now
necessarily,
that
figure
involved
the
payment
into
pacific
of
very,
very
large
sums
of
money.
the
total
amount
paid
in
under
the
rights
offerings
was
approximately
$480
million.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
rights
offerings
would
involve
such
a
large
inflow
of
capital,
it
was
necessary
to
take
cognizance
of
that
and
not
raise
capital
as
pacific
had
customarily
by
issuing
its
own
securities.
it
was
--
pacific
then
was
requiring
about
$250
million
a
year
and
prior
to
1961,
it
had
been
issuing
its
own
securities,
its
own
debentures
and
its
own
stock
in
order
to
raise
capital.
but
because
the
distribution
of
the
northwest
stock
in
conformity
with
the
california
law
required
the
payment
of
capital
into
pacific,
it
was
unnecessary
for
pacific
during
this
interim
period
to
resort
to
issuance
of
its
own
securities
to
raise
capital.
and
necessarily,
because
pacific
was
a
public
utility,
it
could
not
have
on
hand
properly
large
sums
of
unused
capital.
in
the
interest
of
the
shareholders
and
the
ratepayers,
it
would
have
been
improper
for
pacific
to
have
a
large
amount
of
unused
cash,
lying
in
the
banks
and
yielding
a
low
rate
of
return.
now,
i
have
dealt
with
the
palmer
case
and
i
think
it
might
be
pertinent
here
to
talk
about
the
--
whether
or
not
the
1954
code
changed
the
rule
in
that
case.
as
i
said,
that
rule
was
accepted
by
the
commissioner.
it's
embodied
in
a
general
counsel's
memorandum.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
administrative
practice
of
the
commissioner
for
30
years
has
been
to
follow
the
palmer
case,
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
income,
no
distribution
when
rights
are
issued,
that
when
the
rights
are
exercised,
that's
when
the
distribution
takes
place.
in
fact,
in
the
rulings
that
were
issued
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases,
the
commissioner
applied
the
palmer
doctrine.
the
commissioners
rulings
sated
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
property.
the
property
was
in
the
form
of
a
northwest
stock
and
the
commissioner
further
said
that
the
receipt
of
rights
was
not
taxable
income.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
commissioner's
theory
here
before
this
court
is
not
only
contrary
to
his
long-established
administrative
practice,
but
it's
contrary
to
the
rulings
that
he
expressively
made
in
the
--
in
connection
with
this
reorganization.
now,
as
to
the
1954
code,
the
commissioner
relies
on
a
change
in
the
definition
of
property,
and
the
contention
made
is
that
rights
are
therefore
property
and
when
they're
issued,
there
is
a
distribution
of
a
dividend.
well,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
palmer
case
turns
not
on
the
concept
of
property.
it
turns
on
the
concept
of
what
is
a
distribution
and
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
1954
code
in
language
of
the
statute
dealing
with
distributions
of
property
as
dividends.
not
only
there
was
a
no
change
in
that
language,
but
congress,
in
the
committee
reports
stated
that
section
301
which
embodies
this
language
substantially
was
the
same
as
the
corresponding
provisions
in
the
prior
law
which
were
involved
in
the
palmer
case.
there
is
no
indication
whatever
in
any
of
the
committee
reports
that
congress
ever
made
any
change
in
this
important
rule,
in
this
backhanded
fashion
by
simply
dealing
with
what
i
consider
was
a
drafting
clarification
in
the
definition
of
property
and
we've
explained
that
in
our
brief.
it's
a
highly
tactical
point,
but
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
the
assertion
that
congress
intended
to
make
any
change
in
the
1954
code
with
respect
to
the
palmer
rule.
and
after
palmer
case
is
applied,
there
is
a
distribution
because
palmer
said
that
a
sale
of
property
to
shareholders
of
a
corporation
is
in
a
literal
sense,
a
distribution.
there
is
also
a
distribution
solely
of
stock
because
the
subject
to
the
distribution
is
not
the
rights,
but
a
northwest
stock.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
distribution
but
it
does
not
involve
any
distribution
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
there
are
three
elements.
there
clearly
is
a
distribution
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
transfer
of
corporate
property
to
the
shareholders
and
that's
the
sense
in
which
the
word
--
the
term
distribution
is
used
in
section
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
i
am
questioning,
because
it
is
our
position
that
if
this
transaction
does
not
fit
under
section
355,
it
fits
under
some
other
reorganization
provision
or
in
any
event
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
it
would
be
a
taxable
transaction
and
a
taxable
distribution,
your
honor,
but
it
maybe
either
an
ordinary
dividend
or
it
may
be
a
distribution
and
partial
liquidation.
in
our
contention,
one
of
our
alternative
contentions
here
is
that
because
the
northwest
stock
represented
20%
of
the
assets
of
the
pacific
company
before
northwest
was
created
that
if
there
is
any
taxable
distribution,
it
is
a
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no,
it
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
it
was
an
alternative
contention
which
was
not
considered
by
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
found
that
there
was
no
taxable
distribution.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor,
but
it's
a
very
compelling
factor
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
--
in
finding
that
the
purpose
and
the
fact
of
the
reorganization
fits
under
section
355
because
section
355
was
designed
to
accomplish
just
that,
to
permit
one
corporation
to
be
divided
into
two
corporations
or
more
with
essentially
the
same
ownership
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
pacific
shareholders
wound
up
with
certificates
in
two
corporations
instead
of
one,
there
is
just
simply
a
change
in
the
corporate
structures.
we've
had
some
discussion
on
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
and
i
believe
that
the
issue
there
is
controlled
by
the
clear
finding
of
the
tax
court
which
is
clearly
supported
by
the
record
and
this
finding
is
not
supported
only
by
the
documents,
the
representations
that
were
made
by
the
shareholders
in
the
filings
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
were
subject
to
all
the
civil
and
criminal
penalties,
if
there
are
any
material
misrepresentations
of
fact,
but
it's
also
supported
by
the
unequivocal
testimony
of
the
controller
and
the
vice
president
of
pacific.
he
testified
that
the
1963
offering
and
the
1961
offering
of
the
northwest
stock
were
interdependent.
neither
step
would
have
been
taken
without
the
other
and
the
court
found
that
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
transaction
looking
toward
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock
by
pacific.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
american
filed
a
consolidated
return
but
the
absence
of
a
dividend
income
is
predicated
on
the
ruling
that
the
subject
of
the
distribution
was
the
northwest
stock
and
the
commissioner
ruled
that
if
the
basis
of
the
northwest
stock
was
less
than
the
offering
price
and
then
in
the
case
of
corporate
shareholder
of
pacific,
there
would
be
no
dividend
and
american,
like
all
the
other
corporate
shareholders
of
pacific
under
the
commissioner's
ruling,
are
deemed
not
to
have
received
dividend
income.
but
under
the
theory,
the
new
theory,
that
the
commissioner
has
expounded
here,
that
the
rights
are
taxable
income
when
received,
there
still
is
no
income
for
the
corporate
shareholders
because
corporate
shareholders
are
treated
differently
than
individual
shareholders
in
respect
with
dividends
--
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
consolidated
return
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
the
receipt
of
income
through
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
i
might
say
this
that
i
was
somewhat
startled
to
find
in
the
commissioner's
brief
the
espousal
of
the
theory
of
convenience,
the
rule
of
convenience
in
connection
with
determining
tax
liability.
when
the
commissioner
issued
his
rulings,
he
said
the
taxable
event
was
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
now,
the
position
is
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
receipt
of
the
rights.
when
he
ruled
that
the
exercise
event
was
--
gave
rise
to
the
tax,
the
measure
of
the
tax
was
the
difference
in
the
commissioner's
view
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
stock
at
the
time
of
exercise
and
the
offering
price.
now
the
commissioner
asserts
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
receipt
of
the
rights
and
that
while
analytically
speaking,
the
amount
of
the
income
is
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
time
of
receipt,
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
“convenience,”
the
taxable
income
maybe
determined
by
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
stock
and
the
offering
price
at
the
date
of
exercise.
now
i
submit
your
honor
that
--
submit
to
this
court
that
tax
liability
could
not
be
predicated
on
such
flexible
rules.
the
taxable
event
is
either
the
exercised
dates
or
it's
the
receipt
date
or
no
rules
of
convenience
can
be
permitted
simply
because
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
not
much
difference
in
dollar
amount
between
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
date
of
exercise
and
the
value
of
the
rights
at
the
date
of
receipt.
there
must
be
one
rule
of
taxation
that
applies
to
all
taxpayers.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
no
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
the
commissioner
has
taken
a
position
that
as
a
matter
of
computational
convenience,
the
commissioner
could
determine
properly
that
the
measure
of
income
was
the
value
at
the
date
of
exercise.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
the
rule
of
construction
to
be
applied
here.
the
rule
of
construction
which
the
taxpayers
are
contending
for
is
not
a
so
called
liberal
construction.
our
contention
is
the
statute
must
be
applied
as
it
reads
section
355
is
in
the
context
of
the
reorganization
provisions.
it
is
part
of
subchapter
c
dealing
with
all
types
of
reorganizations
not
merely
the
device
of
reorganizations
that
are
embraced
within
the
section
355.
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
that
in
connection
with
section
355,
congress
wished
to
do
a
way
with
forms
in
corporate
mechanics
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
device
of
reorganization
would
be
treated
as
tax
free.
it
wanted
to
deal
with
the
substance.
the
effect
of
transactions
and
the
reason
for
it
is
because
of
the
history
of
the
spin-off,
so
called
spin-off
provisions
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
use
the
tax
jargon
here
which
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
which
occurred
in
the
gregory
case.
now
this
case
is
the
antithesis
of
the
gregory
case.
in
the
gregory
case,
the
taxpayer
used
a
form
of
spin-off
in
order
to
affect
what
was
essentially
a
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits.
it
was
a
tax
avoidance
scheme
pure
and
simple
that
followed
the
form
of
the
statute,
but
the
substance
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
congress
intended.
therefore,
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
spin-off
provisions
could
be
abused,
in
1934,
the
congress
did
away
with
a
spin-off
provision
but
it
retained
all
of
the
other
device
of
reorganization,
the
split-ups
and
the
split-off.
and
the
reason
is
clear
because
the
congress
at
all
times
evinced
the
policy
of
encouraging
the
division
and
the
breaking
up
of
corporations,
rearrangement
of
corporate
structures
with
essentially
the
same
ownership.
therefore,
it
was
impelled
to
reinstate
the
spin-off
provision
in
1951,
but
it
did
not
reinstate
it
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
put
in
1924
when
the
gregory
case
and
all
of
that
litigation
arose.
there
was
a
qualification
in
the
statute
as
it
stood
in
1951
which
showed
clearly
that
congress
did
not
want
the
spin-off
provisions
to
be
abused
by
using
that
form
of
device
of
reorganization
as
a
means
the
getting
earnings
and
profits
out
of
the
corporation.
therefore
in
1954,
when
there
was
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
code,
a
reexamination
of
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
code
and
in
particular
the
corporate
reorganization
provisions,
congress
placed
the
emphasis
on
substance
and
not
form.
and
in
one
section,
section
355,
it
dealt
with
all
types
of
device
of
reorganizations
and
it
said
regardless
of
the
mechanics,
the
forms,
the
corporate
forms
used
whether
it's
a
spin-off
or
a
split-off
or
a
split-up,
as
long
as
in
substance,
there
was
no
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits
then
that
change
of
corporate
ownership,
change
in
corporate
structure
on
their
audit
form
would
be
permitted
to
take
place
on
a
tax-free
basis.
the
purpose
of
congress,
i
think,
in
doing
that
is
well
set
out
in
the
committee
report.
the
committee
report
is
referred
to
in
the
commissioner's
brief
on
page
2
of
his
reply,
but
unfortunately,
he
has
omitted
from
the
text
which
is
quoted,
the
entire
language
which
shows
clearly
that
congress
wished
to
be
exceedingly
liberal
with
respect
to
readjustments
and
rearrangements
of
corporate
structure
but
to
tighten
up
on
the
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits
so
that
the
substance,
the
effect
of
the
transactions
would
control.
the
full
text
of
that
statement
in
the
committee
report
which
i
have
referred
to
appears
in
the
taxpayers'
brief
on
pages
33
and
34
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
statement
in
that
report
that
i
think
is
pertinent
here,
“thus,
your
committee
would
liberalize
present
law
with
respect
to
the
non-recognition
of
gain
or
loss
in
cases
which
involved
mere
rearrangements
of
the
corporate
structure
while
at
the
same
time,
providing
less
liberal
rules
in
other
areas
in
order
to
ensure
that
transactions
which
are
in
substance,
although
not
in
form,
dividend
distributions
by
corporations
to
their
shareholders
are
subject
to
tax
at
ordinary
income
rather
than
a
capital
gain
rates”.
now
what
do
we
have
here?
we
have
precisely
what
the
committee
was
dealing
with,
the
rearrangement
of
corporate
structures
with
essentially
the
same
ownership
and
this,
the
statute
was
designed
to
permit
to
be
accomplished
on
a
tax-free
basis.
the
changes
that
were
made
in
the
prior
law
by
the
1954
code
through
section
355
are
set
out
in
the
brief
of
the
taxpayers,
the
opening
brief
on
pages
34
and
35,
and
they
show
clearly
that
congress
in
dealing
away
with
a
necessity
for
pro
rata
distributions
and
making
it
unnecessary
to
form
a
holding
company
which
would
take
over
the
stock
of
a
controlled
corporation
and
be
the
subject
of
a
tax
free
spin-off.
congress
was
concerned
with
eliminating
all
of
these
corporate
mechanics,
but
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
use
of
section
355
to
distribute
earnings
and
profits
in
the
four
conditions
two
of
which
had
been
relied
on
by
the
commissioner
here.
the
four
conditions
in
section
355
are
all
designed
to
implement
this
overall
concern
of
congress
that
there'd
be
no
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits.
now
when
the
taxpayers
exercise
their
rights,
when
the
pacific
shareholders
exercise
their
rights,
what
happens?
was
there
any
distribution
of
earnings
and
profits?
assuredly
not
because
all
of
the
property
and
net
worth
that
had
been
in
pacific
was
then
in
two
corporations,
pacific
and
northwest
and
was
still
available
for
distribution
of
dividends
to
be
taxed
when
as
and
if
distributed,
but
not
until
then.
now,
turning
to
the
precise
language
of
355
(a)
(1)
(a),
taking
that
language
as
it
should
be
read
in
its
ordinary
meaning
and
in
the
context
in
which
the
section
appears,
it
is
our
contention
that
we
meet
all
of
the
conditions
prescribed.
mr.
harry
r.
horrow
yes,
your
honor.
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(a),
a
corporation
referred
to
in
this
section
as
a
distributing
corporation
distributes.
assuredly
there
was
a
distribution
here
under
the
palmer
case,
the
transfer
of
corporate
property
to
a
shareholder
is
a
distribution
even
though
it
might
be
called
a
sale.
as
the
palmer
case
says,
a
sale
literally
is
a
distribution.
and
the
language
is
precisely
the
same
in
section
301
which
seemingly
the
commissioner
agrees,
includes
a
so
called
sale
or
on
pages
6
and
7,
the
reply
brief
of
the
commissioner,
the
statement
is
made
and
i
quote,
“there
is
such
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock
only
when
the
sale
is
a
bargain,
the
price
is
less
than
value”.
in
that
circumstance
which
is
the
present
case,
the
item
distributed
is
the
value
of
the
bargain
measured
by
the
spread
between
the
price
and
the
value.
it
is
submitted
that
what
is
distributed
is
not
an
item
of
value.
what
is
distributed
is
property
and
the
property
that
was
distributed
here
was
the
northwest
stock.
with
respect
to
its
stock,
as
our
brief
shows
clearly,
means
simply
the
recognition
of
the
shareholders
in
their
capacity
as
such
and
nothing
more.
we
believe
that
we
complied
in
every
way
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
section
355.
