justice

l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
mind
telling
me
where
the
name
spin-off
came
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
sometime
ago
that
they
all
would
sell
the
stock
for
less
than
its
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
say
that
that
was
not
adding
to
the
stock
value
of
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
not
add
to
the
--
that
general
assets
of
the
company
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
book
gain,
but
an
actual
loss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
started
to
ask
you
this
question.
you
make
one
argument
under
section
(a)
of
355
and
one
under
section
(b).
do
you
argue
those,
so
to
speak,
conjunctively
or
alternately?
either
one
of
them
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
--
one
have
to
agree
with
you
on
both,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
when
the
shareholder
received
what
he
gets,
did
he
receive
in
stock,
plus
rights,
something
of
greater
value
than
he
had
in
the
original
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
he
didn't,
if
the
rights
worth
more
than
when
they
were
assessed
and
as
valued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
more
specific
in
the
same
condition
it
had
been,
when
the
stock
was
issued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
it
wasn't
--
this
went
to
different
shareholders,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
the
same
shareholders
but
with
a
different
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
if,
i'll
just
say
if
--
why
if
the
stock
was
worth
more,
i
mean
the
right
was
worth
more
than
it
was
assessed
there,
when
it
passed
out
to
the
pacific's
holding,
was
not
then
a
distribution
of
dividend
so
far
as
pacific
was
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
same
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
same
statute
or
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
wouldn't
that
be
if
the
rights
were
created
in
a
way,
it
gave
the
man
something
more
valuable
than
what
that
which
he
hadn't
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
property
is
something
of
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
it
accepted,
when
it's
accepted
as
a
stock
in
the
new
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
or
assert
that
these
sections
which
requires
the
distribution,
immediately
before
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation,
immediately
withhold
the
distribution,
then
referred
all
of
it,
but
it
says
all
of
the
stock
and
the
securities
and
you
say
that
they
did
not
get
it
actually
until
rights
had
been
exercised
and
cover
it
within
the
form.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
all
of
the
stock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(d)
(1)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
been
mistaken.
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
this
alternative
of
the
solicitor
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
he
was
or
not,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
all
of
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
rights
were
not
distributed,
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
until
they
were
cashed
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
plus
the
rights
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
it
was,
they
didn't
get
the
stock,
did
they
until
they
cashed
in
those
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
tell
me,
that
was
how
many
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
the
distribution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
wasn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
would
he
overlook
at
the
grades
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
its
actual
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that's
what
we'd
have
to
consider,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
i
just
give
them
a
dividend
with
that
much
money,
would
that
made
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
stock
was
the
same
as
cash,
wasn't
it?
