justice

fortas
who
won,
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
get
that
--
how
do
you
get
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
how
do
you
get
the
treatment
of
it
as
a
dividend?
you
mean
that
it
should
treat
as
dividend,
the
difference
between
$16
or
six
--
whatever
works
out
to?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
the
difference
between
the
price
at
which
the
right
was
sold
and
the
amount
paid
by
the
stockholder
to
pacific
should
all
be
treated
as
dividend,
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
your
--
is
it
your
position
that
in
any
case
where
warrants
are
distributed
even
without
the
payment
of
money
that
that
destroys
the
tax-free
aspects
of
the
transaction?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
it
happened
that
the
mathematics
of
it,
the
arithmetic
of
the
transaction
worked
out
so
that
the
stock
right
was
distributed
together
with
warrants.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
isn't
quite
so.
isn't
your
company,
pacific
distributed
the
stock
less
$16
per
share,
in
effect
that's
totally
shortly
enough,
either
that
the
$16
was
either
--
either
has
to
be
subtracted
as
a
practical
matter
from
the
value
of
northwest
or
you
have
treat
it
as
a
capital
contribution
--
i'm
just
talking
about
the
net
effect
of
the
transaction.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
way
it
was
set
up
actually
in
the
plan,
wasn't
it,
as
announced
to
the
shareholders.
it
was
set
up
as
a
sale.
justice
abe
fortas
they
did
that
less
$16
though?
justice
abe
fortas
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
if
you
pursue
that
line
of
argument,
you
would
find
yourself
impaled
on
the
other
horn
of
the
dilemma
that
he
presents,
because
in
that
event,
there
haven't
been
some
trading
in
the
warrants
of
the
stock
that
was
not
distributed
to
the
stockholders
of
pacific,
but
it
was
distributed
in
part
of
the
stockholders
and
in
part
to
others
and
in
any
event,
there
is
no
assurance
that
it
was
distributed
as
a
statute
seems
to
contemplate
pro
rata
(voice
overlap)
pacific.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
black,
you
said
that
the
distribution
did
not
take
place
until
the
stock
of
northwest
was
distributed.
and
if
that
so,
and
there
was
trading
in
the
rights
in
the
intervening
time,
then
the
distribution
did
not
take
place
to
stockholders
of
pacific,
but
only
in
part
to
stockholders
of
pacific
and
in
part
to
strangers
and
that's
what
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
argues.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
could
you
have
stop
--
could
the
company
have
stopped
short
of
the
1963
transaction
without
a
breach
of
its
representations
in
the
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
--
(voice
overlap)
as
if
it
could
have,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
show
me
the
language
on
which
you
rely
on?
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
that
appear
in
the
plan?
have
you
got
a
reference
to
it?
because
i'm
looking
at
the
108
of
the
record
and
108
of
the
record
says
that
promptly
after
acquiring
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
the
plan,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
the
language
to
which
i
refer
and
which
the
solicitor
general
referred
appears
on
108
and
109
of
the
record,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
first,
it
says
that
promptly
after
acquiring
the
securities
of
the
new
company,
the
company
will
offer
for
sale
approximately
56%
of
the
stock.
and
then
on
page
109,
it
says
it's
expected
that
within
about
three
years,
the
company
will
offer
for
sale
the
balance
of
the
stock.
are
you
saying
that
there's
something
in
the
plan
that
countered
--
that's
contrary
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
could
you
tell
me
where
in
here,
there
is
a
provision
saying
that
the
company
will
distribute
all
of
the
stock
to
the
stockholder?
it
may
be
here,
but
i
haven't
seen
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
not
all
that
clear
just
by
the
text?
justice
abe
fortas
