mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
technical
tax
case,
about
as
technical
as
they
come
and
i
think
i
ought
to
make
a
confession.
i
used
it
as
an
examination
question
two
years
ago
and
thus
had
the
benefit
of
reading
the
reactions
to
200
young
minds
and
i
don’t
think
i
learned
a
great
deal.
mr.
griswold
it
was
a
tie.
mr.
griswold
how
--
mr.
griswold
that,
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
[laughter]
i
did
not
review
the
record.
the
case
involves
the
construction
of
section
355
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
a
provision
which
deals
with
what
are
called
divisive
reorganizations.
some
reorganizations
put
corporations
together
and
section
355
deals
with
situations
where
they're
taken
apart.
in
the
jargon
of
the
trade,
section
355
includes
such
things
as
split-ups,
split-offs,
and
spin-offs.
and
the
transaction
involved
here
is
or
may
be
or
maybe
is
not
a
spin-off.
now
the
question
is
whether
it
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
there
is
no
income
on
the
receipt
of
stock
or
securities
on
a
spin-off
when
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are
met.
a
spin-off
arises
in
a
situation
where
a
corporation
has
a
subsidiary
and
distributes
the
stock
or
securities
in
the
subsidiary
to
its
shareholders
without
the
shareholders
giving
up
anything.
there
is
no
exchange.
the
general
theory
is
that
the
shareholders
have
two
pieces
of
paper
representing
the
same
interests
which
they
had
before.
now
where
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
complied
with,
it
is
provided
that
no
gain
or
loss
will
be
recognized
on
the
receipt
of
securities
in
a
spin-off.
the
problem
here
arises
on
these
facts.
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
which
we
will
call
pacific,
for
many
years
has
operated
telephone
service
in
california,
oregon,
washington
and
idaho,
and
through
a
subsidiary
in
nevada.
since
1907,
more
than
80%
of
the
voting
stock
of
pacific
has
been
held
by
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company.
and
in
1961,
which
is
the
year
and
the
only
year
before
the
court,
at&t
owned
about
90%
of
pacific's
common
stock,
about
78%
of
pacific's
preferred
stock,
and
had
nearly
90%
of
the
voting
power
in
pacific.
during
the
late
1950s
and
in
1960,
pacific
in
the
process
of
evolving
its
management
of
this
great
enterprise
developed
a
plan
to
decentralize
its
operations
by
separating
out
its
business
in
oregon,
washington
and
idaho.
it
organized
a
new
corporation
called
pacific
northwest
bell
telephone
company
and
which
we
refer
to
as
northwest
in
this
case.
in
creating
a
new
corporation,
it
transferred
a
small
amount
of
cash
to
northwest
for
stock
and
then
it
transferred
all
of
its
assets
in
oregon,
washington
and
idaho
to
northwest
in
exchange
for
the
balance
of
its
stock
and
debentures.
at
this
point,
july
1,
1961,
northwest
exists
as
a
complete
operating
corporation
wholly
owned
by
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
company.
if
pacific
had
then
distributed
all
of
the
northwest
stock
and
securities
to
its
shareholders,
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
spin-off
and
that
no
gain
or
loss
would
be
recognized.
indeed,
the
same
result
would
have
happened,
subject
to
certain
conditions,
if
pacific
had
distributed
at
least
80%
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
this
would
have
been
a
spin-off
and
thus
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
making
the
distribution
tax
free.
however,
pacific
chose
not
to
proceed
in
this
way
and
that's
why
the
problem
arises
here.
instead
of
distributing
all
of
the
stock
or
at
least
80%
of
it,
pacific
chose
to
issue
warrants
or
rights
to
its
shareholders
in
1961
through
which
they
or
persons
who
purchased
their
rights
could
buy
not
all
or
80%
but
57%
of
the
northwest
stock.
under
the
rights
offer,
it
took
six
rights
and
$16
to
acquire
a
share
of
northwest
stock
and
$16
was
less
than
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
so
that
the
rights
had
value.
at
the
time
when
these
rights
were
issued,
pacific
had
what
it
denominated
a
plan
in
which
it
was
stated
that
pacific
expected
to
dispose
of
the
rest
of
the
stock
through
further
issues
of
rights,
the
time
and
prices
to
be
determined
later.
however,
pacific
was
under
no
obligation
to
make
such
a
disposition.
it
did
in
fact
issue
further
rights
in
1963,
21
months
later.
as
a
result,
all
of
the
northwest
stock
was
eventually
disposed
of
either
to
the
pacific
shareholders
at
the
two
separated
points
of
time
or
to
the
persons
to
whom
such
shareholders
sold
their
rights.
in
the
first
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
the
gordon
case
number
760,
the
shareholder
received
rights
in
1962
and
exercised
them.
the
question
is
whether
he
had
income
from
this
transaction.
in
the
other
case
before
the
court,
the
bann
case,
number
781,
the
shareholder
exercised
all
of
his
rights
but
four.
as
i've
said,
it
took
six
rights
plus
$16
to
subscribe
to
a
share
of
northwest
stock.
mr.
bann
exercised
all
of
his
rights
that
he
could
to
get
full
shares,
but
he
had
four
leftover,
and
he
sold
those
four.
the
question
in
the
bann
case
with
respect
to
the
receipt
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
is
the
same
as
that
in
the
gordon
case.
in
the
bann
case
however,
there
is
the
additional
question
as
to
the
tax
liability
arising
with
respect
to
the
four
rights
which
were
not
exercised
but
were
sold.
at
the
time
the
transaction
was
under
consideration,
counsel
for
pacific
submitted
the
question
to
the
internal
revenue
service
for
a
ruling
and
that
ruling
is
set
out
in
full
at
page
146
of
the
record
dated
june
28,
1961
just
before
the
transfer
occurred.
the
service
rule
that
the
transaction
did
not
fall
within
section
355
and
that
the
shareholders
would
be
taxable.
of
course
that
ruling
isn't
binding
on
the
court.
i
mention
it
however
to
show
the
position
of
those
charged
with
administering
the
tax
laws
and
to
show
further
that
pacific
and
its
shareholders
were
not
taken
by
surprise
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
unfair
if
it
should
eventually
be
concluded
that
the
treasury's
contemporaneous
ruling
was
correct.
after
the
transaction
was
carried
out
and
returns
for
1961
had
been
filed,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
determined
deficiencies
against
the
two
taxpayers
now
before
the
court,
who,
as
i
have
indicated,
had
received
and
exercised
rights,
but
had
not
included
anything
in
their
tax
returns
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
the
taxpayers
filed
petition
for
review
with
the
tax
court.
in
a
careful
opinion
by
judge
raum,
the
taxpayers
prevailed
there.
judge
raum
held
that
since
a
distribution
of
the
northwest
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders
without
payment
would
have
been
tax-free.
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
congress
intended
a
tax
liability
to
result
from
a
lesser
distribution,
that
is
an
offer
to
dispose
of
the
shares
at
a
price
through
rights
as
the
transaction
was
actually
carried
out.
from
the
decision
of
the
tax
court,
two
separate
appeals
were
taken;
one
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
gordon
case
and
the
other
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
bann
case.
the
second
circuit
decided
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
in
a
two-to-one
decision
with
judge
friendly
dissenting.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
in
favor
of
the
commissioner.
thus,
there
was
a
square
conflict
of
decisions.
both
sides
filed
petitions
for
certiorari
and
these
are
the
cases.
both
arise
on
the
same
record
which
are
now
before
the
court.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
arises
in
the
same
basic
area
as
was
involved
in
the
famous
gregory
case
in
293
u.s.
decided
in
1935,
i
suppose
all
tax
lawyers
would
agree
one
of
the
great
landmarks
in
the
tax
law.
the
gregory
case
involved
a
spin-off.
at
that
time,
this
was
an
area
which
had
come
to
be
used
very
widely
for
rather
blatant
tax
avoidance
which
was
the
situation
in
the
gregory
case
itself.
as
a
result,
not
only
was
the
gregory
decision
announced
from
this
court,
but
congress
repealed
the
provisions
which
had
been
included
in
the
earlier
revenue
laws
granting
tax-free
status
to
spin-offs.
and
there
was
no
provision
for
tax-free
status
of
spin-offs
between
1934
and
1951,
a
period
of
17
years.
now,
let
me
make
it
plain
that
in
this
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
substantial
and
legitimate
business
purpose
and
for
the
steps
which
pacific
took
with
respect
to
its
northwest
operations.
the
reference
to
the
gregory
case
however
does
seem
to
me
to
be
relevant
because
it
shows
that
congress
knew
that
this
was
a
delicate
area
with
substantial
tax
avoidance
potential.
as
a
result,
when
congress
first
restored
a
tax-free
status
to
some
spin-offs
in
1951,
it
included
careful
restrictions.
these
restrictions
were
extended
and
amplified
in
the
1954
code,
section
355
which
is
now
before
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
background
of
the
spin-off
provisions
and
the
language
which
congress
actually
used,
it
is
our
position
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
language
of
the
statute
would
be
carefully
read,
that
its
requirements
would
have
to
be
met,
and
that
it
could
not
be
given
a
broad
and
sweeping
construction.
the
statutory
provision
involved
here
is
the
same
sort
of
provision
as
that
relating
to
collapsible
corporations,
which
was
involved
in
braunstein
against
the
commissioner
in
374
u.s.
where
the
court
referred
to
the
statute
there
as
setting
up
“a
carefully
and
elaborately
defined
category
of
transactions”.
we
have
such
a
provision
here.
let
us
turn
then
to
the
statute
itself.
as
i've
said
at
the
opening
of
the
argument,
this
is
a
technical
tax
case.
much
of
the
technicality
is
developed
in
the
main
briefs
and
the
reply
briefs
which
have
been
filed
by
both
of
the
parties.
i'm
going
to
try
to
keep
my
argument
relatively
simple
focusing
attention
on
three
provisions
of
the
statute.
if
more
detail
is
wanted,
it
will
be
found
in
ample
amounts
in
the
briefs
which
have
been
prepared
for
the
court.
the
full
text
of
section
355
appears
at
several
places
in
the
papers
before
the
court.
the
place
to
which
i
shall
refer
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
main
brief,
the
usual
gray-covered
brief,
beginning
at
page
53
of
that
brief.
section
355
is
a
part
of
subchapter
(c)
in
the
internal
revenue
code
relating
to
corporate
distributions
and
reorganizations.
it
follows
section
351
which
deals
with
transfers
to
a
controlled
corporation
and
section
354
which
deals
with
exchanges
in
connection
with
a
reorganization.
section
355
is
itself
entitled
distribution
of
stock
and
securities
of
a
controlled
corporation.
as
you
will
see,
it's
a
long
provision
occupying
nearly
all
of
four
pages
in
the
brief.
generally
speaking
though,
we
need
be
concerned
only
with
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
page
53
and
the
top
of
page
54,
that
is
a
total
of
one
and
a
half
out
of
the
entire
four
pages.
the
rest
of
the
provision
is
important
as
a
part
of
the
setting
of
the
statute
since
it
illustrates
the
care
with
which
congress
drew
the
provision
and
its
apparent
concern
that
its
term
should
be
specific
and
carefully
safeguarded.
let
us
then
look
at
paragraph
(a)
(1)
of
section
355
as
it
begins
on
page
53
of
the
government's
brief.
it
starts
off
with
one
important
condition
imposing
word
‘if.
it
says,
“if
a
corporation
referred
to
in
this
section
as
the
distributing
corporation;
(i)
it
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock”,
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
or,
and
then
we
can
skip
(ii)
as
it
has
no
application
here,
what
does
the
corporation
distribute?
the
section
then
continues,
“solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation”,
referred
to
in
this
section
as
controlled
corporation,
which
it
controls
immediately
before
the
distribution.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
the
important
words
there
are
in
(i)
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
and
then
the
words
immediately
following
(ii)
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
now,
in
examining
this
statute,
we
can
skip
the
provisions
of
paragraphs
(b)
and
(c)
at
the
bottom
of
page
53
and
go
over
to
the
next
page,
page
54
of
the
government's
brief.
we
there
find
(d)
as
part
of
the
distribution.
the
distributing
corporation
distributes;
(i)
all
of
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution,
or,
and
then,
there's
a
longer
(ii)
and
which
makes
it
applicable
if
they
do
distribute
80%
and
certain
other
conditions
are
complied
with.
then,
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
to
and
no
amount
shall
be
includable
in
the
income
of
such
shareholder
or
security
holder
on
the
receipt
of
such
stock
or
securities,
which
is
a
consummation
devotedly
to
be
wished
by
any
taxpayer.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
what
was
actually
done
by
pacific's
management
here
meets
the
terms
of
the
provisions
of
section
355
to
which
i
referred.
mr.
griswold
that
relates
to
debt
securities,
mr.
justice.
if
they
had
distributed
for
example
debentures,
paragraph
(3)
says
that
paragraph
(1)
should
not
apply
--
mr.
griswold
security
does
not
apply
to
stock
--
mr.
griswold
and
that
is
only
inapplicable
because
securities
are
not
involved.
i
think
we
can
perhaps
have
some
discussion
as
to
whether
rights,
not
being
stocked,
are
securities,
but
that
isn't
directly
involved
here.
before
looking
at
these
specific
provisions
in
greater
detail,
i
may
observe
that
counsel
for
the
taxpayer,
if
i
may
so,
prefer
to
ignore
the
precise
language
of
the
statute.
they
advance
section
355
as
a
beneficent
provision
designed
to
be
applicable
to
bona
fide
spin-offs
of
all
sorts.
they
prefer
not
to
look
at
the
exact
text
of
the
--
detailed
statutory
provisions
which
congress
actually
wrote
and
wrote
with
care
in
the
light
of
its
experience
with
earlier
spin-off
provisions
in
the
gregory
case.
indeed,
in
the
first
51
pages
of
the
taxpayer's
brief
in
this
court,
they
speak
of
section
355
only
in
general
terms
and
make
no
reference
to
the
precise
language
which
the
congress
wrote.
mr.
griswold
frankly,
i
don't
know.
there
are
--
there
are
split-offs
which
occur
when
a
portion
of
the
business
is
taken
out
and
given
to
shareholders
in
exchange
for
some
of
their
stock,
a
split-off
involves
an
exchange.
there
are
split-ups
where
for
example,
the
business
is
divided
into
two
corporations
and
the
shares
in
those
two
corporations
are
then
distributed
to
the
shareholders
in
exchange
for
their
stock.
both
a
split-off
and
a
split-up
involved
an
exchange.
but
a
spin-off
is
applied
to
a
situation
where
there
is
no
exchange.
where
there
is
a
corporation
and
for
a
good
and
sufficient
reason,
a
portion
of
it
is
separated
out
and
that
stock
is
then
distributed
to
the
shareholders
of
the
original
corporation.
and
i
suppose
it
has
a
certain
picture
appeal,
that
as
long
as
i
can
remember
has
been
called
a
spin-off.
certainly
that
was
the
reference
that
was
made
in
the
gregory
case
which
goes
back
35
years
now.
mr.
griswold
this
--
this
case
would
have
been
a
spin-off
if
they
had
distributed
the
stock
in
pacific.
whether
or
not
it
is
a
spin-off,
we
will
learn
when
this
court
has
decided
the
case,
i
suppose.[laughter]
mr.
griswold
well,
i
referred
to
it
in
my
opening
statement
as
a
kind
of
a
spin-off
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
if
it's
not
a
spin-off,
it's
a
sale
of
the
pacific
stock
through
the
issuance
of
rights.
and
as
a
sale
of
the
pacific
stock
through
the
issuance
of
rights,
it
should
be
treated
as
a
sale
as
it
was
by
pacific
in
this
case.
pacific
made
a
gain
on
the
shares
which
it
sold
to
its
shareholders
and
reported
that
gain
for
tax
purposes
and
the
question
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
shareholders,
if
section
355
does
not
apply
because
it
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities,
then
turn
simply
on
the
other
general
provisions
of
the
statute
and
it
would
be
a
distribution
of
property
which
since
pacific
had
adequate
earnings
and
profits
would
be
a
dividend
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
griswold
no,
it
is
not
--
i'm
sorry,
i
referred
to
split-up
and
split-off,
but
section
355
does
relate
to
them
as
well
as
to
distributions
without
the
giving
up
of
any
other
property.
now,
it's
recognized
of
course
that
sometimes
statutes
are
read
rather
broadly
and
it
clearly
seen
objective
becomes
the
touchstone
to
interpretation.
in
other
situations,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
one,
the
statutes
are
written
in
a
highly
articulated
manner
and
are
clearly
designed
to
be
read
specifically
and
not
in
general
terms.
broadly
speaking,
i
think
that
this
is
the
line
on
which
this
case
will
be
determined.
if
one
looks
only
at
the
general
situation
as
the
taxpayers'
counsels
do
as
far
as
they
can,
reasons
may
be
found
which
will
lead
to
a
conclusion
their
way.
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
looks
at
the
statute
and
gives
a
fair
construction
to
the
language
actually
used
by
congress,
it
will
be
found
i
submit
that
the
conditions
of
the
statute
were
not
met
and
that
the
tax-free
status
sought
by
the
taxpayers
was
not
achieved.
so
let's
look
at
the
terms
of
the
statute
with
the
facts
of
the
case
in
mind.
in
doing
this,
i
would
recall
that
the
issue
arises
because
pacific
chose
to
use
warrants
or
rights
rather
than
distributing
the
northwest
stock
to
its
shareholders
outright.
if
pacific
had
done
the
latter
here,
there
would
be
no
problem.
why
should
the
result
be
different,
simply
because
they
did
something
less?
the
answer
is
i
think
that
the
one
would
have
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
statute
while
what
was
actually
done
did
not,
and
the
difference
is
not
entirely
formal
for
a
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
would
have
been
a
true
spin-off,
a
division
of
the
same
enterprise
into
two,
with
each
shareholder
of
pacific
now
owning
two
pieces
of
paper
to
represent
exactly
what
he
owned
before.
but
what
was
actually
done
was
quite
different
and
not
within
the
spirit
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
not
within
its
terms.
what
was
actually
done
was
a
refinancing
of
pacific,
a
sale
of
a
part
of
its
northwest
stock
in
1961
for
a
very
large
sum
of
money
which
reviews
for
the
expansion
of
pacific's
operations
in
california,
as
well
as
to
pay
off
part
of
its
indebtedness
to
at&t.
pacific
shareholders
did
not
simply
receive
the
northwest
stock
as
section
355
contemplates.
they
had
to
buy
it
and
to
put
large
sums
of
new
money
into
pacific
in
order
to
get
their
shares
in
northwest,
or
else
to
sell
or
lose
their
rights.
now,
how
does
this
fit
in
into
the
actual
terms
of
the
statute?
let's
look
again
at
the
beginning
of
section
355
(a)
(1)
(a).
if
a
corporation
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
did
pacific
distribute
northwest
stock
to
its
shareholders
with
respect
to
its
stock?
i
suggest
that
it
did
not.
in
actual
fact,
pacific
made
two
distributions
or
dispositions
in
1961.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
there
were
two
separate
mailings
of
distinct
items.
first
on
september
29,
1961,
it
distributed
rights
to
its
shareholders.
that
was
certainly
a
distribution
but
was
it
a
distributed
stock
in
northwest,
no,
rights
to
the
shareholders.
this
was
a
distribution
to
its
shareholders
with
respect
to
its
stock,
but
it
was
clearly
a
distribution
of
rights,
not
of
northwest
stock.
no
shareholder
received
northwest
stock
at
that
time
and
no
shareholder
would
receive
northwest
stock
at
a
later
time
unless
he
took
affirmative
steps
which
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
do.
at
a
somewhat
later
time,
pacific
did
sell
northwest
stock,
but
not
to
its
shareholders.
the
sales
were
made
to
the
then
holders
of
warrants
or
rights
who
might
or
might
not
have
been
shareholders
of
pacific.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
about
a
third
of
the
minority
shareholders
of
pacific
did
not
exercise
their
rights
and
did
not
receive
northwest
stock.
mr.
griswold
there
were
some
80,000
rights
that
expired,
but
several
hundred
thousand
which
must
have
been
sold.
there
--
these
were
traded
on
the
exchange.
there
was
a
–
a
before
issuance
market
and
a
market
during
all
the
time
that
they
were
outstanding.
this
is
what,
in
the
bann
case,
the
problem
we
had
with
respect
to
the
four
rights.
in
that
case,
they
sold
the
four
rights
and
the
question
arises
as
to
the
taxability
of
the
proceeds.
the
important
matter
in
the
application
of
the
statute
is
that
northwest
stock
was
not
distributed
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
it
was
in
fact
distributed
to
whatever
person's
owned
and
presented
the
rights,
together
with
$16
for
each
share
of
northwest
stock
to
be
acquired.
this
is
not
what
the
statute
says
and
the
refinancing,
which
was
carried
out
is
not
what
was
contemplated
when
the
statute
was
formulated.
one
element
in
that
picture,
which
i
think
is
relevant
is
that
the
spin-off
statute,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plainly
contemplates
that
the
size
of
the
distributing
corporation
will
be
reduced
after
the
distribution.
now,
you
have
a
corporation
which
has
a
subsidiary.
it
distributes
the
subsidiary
and
the
old
corporation
is
left
with
reduced
assets.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
book
value
is
concerned,
the
result
was
an
actual
increase
of
the
size
of
pacific
after
the
distribution
because
the
book
value
to
pacific
of
the
northwest
shares
was
less
than
the
$16
a
share
which
it
received
on
the
distribution
of
each
share.
that
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
capital
gain,
which
pacific
recognized
and
returned.
there's
one
element
in
this
picture,
which
makes
me
a
little
nervous.
it
was
suggested
for
the
first
time
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
when
the
second
circuit
said
that
well,
really,
this
was
a
distribution
of
northwest
stock
to
the
shareholders.
and
what
the
shareholders
did
then
was
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific.
they
treated
the
$16
as
a
--
or
they
said
it
could
be
treated
as
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific
rather
than
as
a
payment
of
the
purchase
price.
well
now,
if
it's
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific,
it
would
not
be
taxable
income
to
pacific,
and
i
see
lurking
in
the
background
here
a
claim
for
refund
by
pacific
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
contribution
to
capital.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
extremely
far-fetched.
the
transaction
was
referred
to
in
the
plan
as
an
offer
to
sell
the
shares.
it
was
understood
by
all
as
an
offer
to
sell
the
shares
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
sale,
both
in
this
case
and
with
respect
to
pacific.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
--
it
took
six
rights
and
$16
to
buy
one
share
of
northwest
and
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
at
this
time
was
--
of
the
order
of
$26
a
share.
mr.
griswold
that
that
was
--
mr.
griswold
i
said
--
i
referred,
mr.
justice,
and
perhaps
it
was
misleading,
to
the
book
value
of
the
assets.
it
is
true
that
it
reduced
the
actual
value
of
the
assets
by
the
amount
of
the
spread.
but
the
book
value
of
the
northwest
shares,
which
was
based
upon
the
amount
of
money
which
pacific
had
invested
in
the
three
states
was
of
the
order
of
$14
or
$15
a
share,
so
that
the
$16
which
they
received
resulted
in
a
book
gain,
which
for
tax
purposes
would
have
to
be
recognized.
mr.
griswold
a
book
gain
but
an
actual
loss,
that
is
true,
an
actual
loss
of
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
shares
and
the
$16
a
share
--
mr.
griswold
$16
was
more
than
their
--
mr.
griswold
more
than
their
base
is.
what
they
paid
for
--
well,
their
bases
is
somewhat
complicated
because
it
involved
the
amount
that
they
had
invested
in
assets
in
those
three
states,
which
they
then
distributed
to
pacific
in
exchange
for
pacific's
stock.
now,
the
argument
that
i've
just
made
with
respect
to
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
(i)
applies
too
to
the
following
portion
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
there
be
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
word
‘solely'
was
added
in
1954
when
congress
enacted
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
the
corresponding
provision
which
was
put
in
1951
did
not
have
the
‘solely'
there.
now,
the
taxpayers
can't
have
it
both
ways,
it
seems
to
me.
either
there
was
a
distribution
of
rights,
in
which
case,
it
was
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
his
stock
but
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities.
or
there
was
a
distribution
of
northwest
stock,
although
it
was
more
accurately
a
sale,
in
which
case,
it
was
made
to
the
right
holders
and
thus
was
not
a
distribution
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock.
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
the
two
parts
were
some
sort
of
a
step
transaction
and
that
they
are
to
be
read
together.
even
that
will
not
bring
them
within
the
statute
as
written,
nor
will
it
mean
that
pacific
distributed
solely
stock
or
securities
in
northwest.
as
this
court
said
in
the
southwest
securities
corporation
case,
315
u.s.,
“solely'
leaves
no
leeway”.
what
pacific
distributed
here
was
rights
representing
an
obligation
against
pacific.
such
rights
are
not
solely
stock
in
northwest.
finally,
there's
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
was
not
met
here.
this
is
on
the
next
page,
page
54,
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
at
the
top
of
page
54.
it
provides
that
the
distributing
corporation.
here,
pacific,
must
distribute;
(i)
all
of
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution,
while
the
following
paragraph
(ii)
qualifies
this,
if
at
least
80%
of
the
stock
is
distributed.
in
this
case,
even
if
the
issuance
of
rights
in
the
sale
of
northwest
stock
in
1961,
is
treated
as
a
distribution
of
stock,
it
was
only
57%.
the
required
aggregate
of
at
least
80%
can
be
reached
only
if
the
1961
distribution
is
added
into
the
--
in
with
the
sale
of
the
remaining
43%
of
the
northwest
stock
which
did
not
occur
until
1963,
more
than
21
months
later.
and
the
important
thing
about
this
is
that
it
was
not
obligating
in
any
way
in
1961.
this
can
best
be
seen
by
examining
the
plan
for
reorganization
which
is
set
out
in
full
beginning
at
page
102
of
the
record,
and
i
would
call
your
attention
particularly
to
the
relevant
portions
of
the
plan
on
page
109.
this
was
carefully
drawn
so
as
not
to
subject
pacific
to
any
obligation
as
to
future
distributions.
note
the
first
line
on
page
109,
“it
is
expected
that
within
about
three
years,”
and
then
further
down
the
page,
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
third
line,
it's
provided
that
the
offering
price
will
be
determined
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
at
the
time
of
each
offering
and
then,
the
next
sentence
begins
it's
expected
that,
and
so
on.
now
plainly,
we
suggest
that
this
does
not
square
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
words
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
(i)
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution
connote
some
sort
at
least
of
a
limited
time
within
which
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
stock
must
be
made.
mr.
griswold
to
some
extent,
mr.
justice,
you're
right.
on
the
other
hand,
the
consolidated
stipulation
of
facts,
which
begins
on
page
33,
contains
references
to
this
matter
in
the
safeguarding
of
the
position.
it
certainly
was
not
squarely
raised
and
presented
in
the
--
mr.
griswold
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice,
and
that
we
have
made
a
brief
reference
to
and
we
put
forth
in
our
brief
that
there
was
here
an
elaborate
stipulation
of
facts
which
set
forth
the
full
text
of
all
of
the
documents
including
a
good
many
internal
documents.
the
papers,
for
example,
which
were
presented
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
and
the
argument
that
we
made
arises
on
the
face
of
those
documents
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
evidence
could
have
been
presented
which
would
change
the
effect
of
those
documents.
after
all,
i
just
referred
to
the
text
of
the
plan
for
reorganization
and
bringing
in
a
witness
who
would
say,
“well,
we
didn't
really
mean
that.
what
we
had
in
mind
was
that
we
were
bound
to
do
it”.
it
seems
to
me
would
not
affect
the
situation.
now,
in
referring
to
the
reference
to
immediately
before
the
distribution
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
(i),
we
don't
suggest
that
everything
has
to
be
done
in
an
instant
or
even
on
the
same
day.
obviously,
time
for
the
mechanics
of
the
transaction
must
be
allowed,
but
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
limited
time
within
which
the
distribution
should
be
made.
if
it's
to
be
done
in
two
stages,
they
must
be
at
least
reasonably
close
together
and
what's
more
important,
committed
from
the
beginning.
otherwise,
it's
impossible
to
know
whether
the
first
distribution
complies
with
the
statute.
at
the
close
of
1961
and
at
the
close
of
1962,
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
determine
the
tax
liability
of
these
taxpayers
for
the
year
1961
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out
in
the
second
circuit
below.
that's
not
only
--
mr.
griswold
i
wouldn't
even
be
sure
of
that.
i
could
imagine
that
you
could
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
distribution
in
december,
a
distribution
in
february,
all
planned
and
committed,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
could
come
within
the
statute.
certainly,
it
makes
it
easier
if
it's
all
within
the
same
taxable
year.
our
only
position
is
that
when
they
are
widely
separated
and
quite
non-committed,
that
section
355,
in
the
light
of
this
language,
cannot
fairly
be
regarded
as
applying.
leaving
the
thing
in
limbo
for
21
months
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
basic
approach,
always
followed
by
congress'
annual
accounting
periods,
but
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
and
thus,
as
is
discussed
in
more
detail
in
our
briefs,
we
contend
that
the
disposition
or
sale
made
here
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
355
because
only
57%
of
the
stock
of
northwest
was
sold
in
1961,
and
there
was
no
commitment
to
dispose
off
the
rest
of
the
stock.
now,
there's
a
remaining
issue
in
the
bann
case,
number
781.
the
taxpayer
there
sold
four
of
his
rights
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
taxable
on
the
proceeds
at
capital
gain
rates.
we've
discussed
this
point
at
the
conclusion
of
our
main
brief.
it's
our
contention
that
the
decision
below
on
this
is
wrong
because
the
distribution
of
rights
did
not
come
within
section
355
as
it
was
obviously
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities
in
northwest.
indeed,
this
point
highlights
our
argument
on
the
main
point
in
the
case.
a
good
deal
of
reference
is
made
in
the
opinions
below
and
in
the
briefs
to
this
court's
decision
in
palmer
against
commissioner
back
in
302
u.s.
where
in
an
opinion
by
justice
stone,
it
was
held
that
the
issuance
of
rights
did
not
constitute
a
distribution
by
a
corporation.
the
premise
on
which
that
opinion
was
based
however
was
that
in
that
particular
case,
the
rights
were
issued
at
the
fair
market
value
of
the
distributed
stock
as
of
the
time
the
rights
were
determined
on.
there
is
a
language
in
the
palmer
case
which
it
seems
to
me
justice
stone
probably
would
be
reexamining
himself
if
he
were
here
to
do
it.
but
i
would
point
out
that
regardless
of
the
palmer
case
and
its
status
now,
the
congress
substantially
amended
the
statute
by
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
adding
a
whole
new
subchapter
(c)
spelling
out
in
much
greater
detail
the
provisions
with
respect
to
distributions.
and
we
would
contend
that
the
palmer
case
is
no
longer
applicable,
whether
it
was
rightly
or
wrongly
decided,
and
that
section
301
and
other
sections
of
the
code
squarely
call
for
the
treatment
of
the
rights
on
receipt
as
being
taxable
income.
now,
it
is
convenient
with
respect
to
rights
which
are
usually
short-lived
to
withhold
taxability
until
the
rights
have
been
disposed
of
and
to
treat
the
proceeds
of
the
rights
as
being
the
dividend
or
distribution.
and
ordinarily,
this
makes
no
difference,
although
we
suggest
that
the
better
analysis
is
to
say
that
the
rights
are
income
at
their
fair
market
value
when
they
are
received.
and
that
there
is
then
a
capital
gain
or
loss,
ordinarily
a
short-term
gain
or
loss,
on
the
sale
of
the
rights
depending
upon
whether
they
were
sold
for
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
than
they
were
worth
when
they
were
received.
in
this
case,
such
a
gain
or
loss
would
have
been
a
short-term
gain
or
loss
all
in
the
same
taxable
year
so
that
the
result
of
the
amount
--
the
result
of
taxing
the
amount
received
on
sale
is
a
convenient
and
wholly
accurate
way
to
treat
the
transaction,
but
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
dividend
distribution
and
not
in
any
sense
as
a
capital
gain
or
loss.
mr.
griswold
well,
roughly
here,
it
would
be
one-sixth
of
the
difference
between
$26
and
$16
or
about
a
$1.66
is
a
right.
it
would
actually
we
suggest
not
be
so
mechanically
determined
in
this
case
since
there
was
a
market,
an
active
market
for
these
shares.
it
would
be
determined
by
what
was
the
market
value
of
the
rights
on
the
date
of
receipt
and
there
was
--
it
did
run
out,
as
i
recall
it,
between
$1.60
and
$1.85,
one
or
two
days
a
little
higher
and
a
little
lower
per
right.
mr.
griswold
no.
i'm
only
--
only
contending
that
the
fair
market
value
of
the
right,
when
received,
should
be
treated
as
a
dividend.
mr.
griswold
that
then
if
the
right
is
sold
some
days
later,
there
is
technically
a
short-term
capital
gain
or
loss
on
the
right.
it
usually
isn't
very
much
and
being
short-term,
it's
treated
in
full
anyway
so
that
it's
easier
and
simpler,
and
it's
the
practice
usually
followed
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
continuing
wait
of
the
palmer
case,
then
what
you
do
is
look
and
see
what
did
he
sell
the
right
for
and
then
treat
that
as
a
dividend.
i'm
only
suggesting
that
though
that's
convenient
and
is
acceptable
to
us
that
perhaps
from
an
excessively
pedantic
point
of
view,
the
analysis
would
be
that
the
distribution
of
the
right
is
a
dividend,
that
it
is
viewed
as
whole
property.
it
can
go
up
or
down
in
value
and
if
it
goes
up
or
down
in
value,
the
difference
between
what
you
get
for
it
and
its
value
when
you
received
it
would
be
a
short-term
capital
gain
or
loss.
mr.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
make
--
we
make
two
arguments
under
355
(a)
(1)
(a);
one
with
respect
to
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
and
the
other
with
respect
to
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
and
then,
we
make
an
argument
under
(d),
d
for
detroit,
we
make
no
argument
under
(b)
or
(c)
and
--
mr.
griswold
those
are
the
two
provisions
of
the
statute
upon
which
we
specifically
relied.
mr.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
if
we
are
right
on
either
one,
then
the
taxpayer
does
not
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
thought
he
made
it
referenced
to
both,
but
he
did
refer
to
d
particularly.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
because
it
is
not
solely
stock
or
securities.
mr.
griswold
there
again,
that
--
that
would
be
exactly
what
was
involved
in
southwest
consolidated.
the
court
there
held
that
warrants
were
not
stock
and
therefore,
it
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities.
we
would
take
the
same
position
here.
mr.
griswold
for
the
reasons
indicated,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
gordon
case
number
760
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
bann
case
number
781
should
be
reversed
on
both
questions
raised.
mr.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
full
quotation
from
the
committee
report
is
given
accurately
in
the
taxpayers
brief
in
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
and
34
and
i
have
--
i
agree
with
it
entirely.
the
congress
wasn't
trying
to
remove
unwarranted
restrictions,
unnecessary
or
desirable
business
practices
but
it
was
also
including
provisions
to
ensure
that
this
would
not
be
misused
and
there's
nothing
in
that
paragraph
in
the
committee
report
which
even
suggest
that
the
language
which
the
congress
actually
used
in
the
statute
is
not
to
be
read
as
having
its
meaning
and
to
be
applied
the
way
it
was
written,
and
that
gets
us
back
to
our
contentions
about
the
three
particular
paragraphs
of
the
statute
where
it
seems
to
us
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
were
not
met
by
the
distribution
of
rights
as
distinguished
from
the
distribution
of
shares.
the
counsel
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
rights
were
used
here
because
there
were
difficulties
under
california
law
and
they
couldn't
have
distributed
the
shares.
i
think
that's,
perhaps,
exaggerated.
pacific
had
able
counsel
here
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
above
or
beyond
their
capacities
to
have
developed
a
recapitalization
which
would
have
produced
capital
surplus,
which
would
have
enabled
the
distribution
to
be
made
if
that's
what
they'd
wanted
to
do.
the
fact
was
that
they
wanted
very
much,
they
needed
desperately,
we're
fortunate
that
we
have
an
excellent
management
available
there.
they
need
it
desperately
to
have
large
amounts
of
new
capital
to
provide
for
the
rapid
growth
of
the
business
in
california
and
as
the
tax
court
pointed
out
on
its
opinion
on
page
240
of
the
record,
this
was
the
dominating
factor
which
determined
their
use
of
rights
rather
than
the
distribution
of
stock.
then
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
rights
are
property,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
one
other
problems
in
this
case
is
that
both
sides
have
to
try
to
deal
somehow
or
other
with
the
palmer
case.
i
don't
think
that
the
palmer
case
is
a
barrier
to
the
government's
position
here
nor
necessarily
a
barrier
to
the
taxpayers'
position,
but
i
think
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
rights
are
a
property.
all
one
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
consider
a
theft
of
the
envelope
containing
the
rights
or
a
question
of
property
tax
liability
with
respect
to
rights.
and
there
is
a
very
important
factor
here
in
that
congress
didn't
make
changes
in
1954
and
they
were
more
substantial
than
my
other
learned
brother
has
indicated.
i
would
call
a
particular
attention
to
section
317
which
is
new
in
the
1954
code
and
which
defines
property
in
such
a
way
as
clearly
to
include
rights
to
subscribe
to
shares
in
another
corporation.
we
would
welcome
a
reexamination
and
a
clarification
of
the
palmer
case
along
the
lines
indicated
in
our
brief.
mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
technical
tax
case,
about
as
technical
as
they
come
and
i
think
i
ought
to
make
a
confession.
i
used
it
as
an
examination
question
two
years
ago
and
thus
had
the
benefit
of
reading
the
reactions
to
200
young
minds
and
i
don’t
think
i
learned
a
great
deal.
mr.
griswold
it
was
a
tie.
mr.
griswold
how
--
mr.
griswold
that,
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
[laughter]
i
did
not
review
the
record.
the
case
involves
the
construction
of
section
355
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
a
provision
which
deals
with
what
are
called
divisive
reorganizations.
some
reorganizations
put
corporations
together
and
section
355
deals
with
situations
where
they're
taken
apart.
in
the
jargon
of
the
trade,
section
355
includes
such
things
as
split-ups,
split-offs,
and
spin-offs.
and
the
transaction
involved
here
is
or
may
be
or
maybe
is
not
a
spin-off.
now
the
question
is
whether
it
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
there
is
no
income
on
the
receipt
of
stock
or
securities
on
a
spin-off
when
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are
met.
a
spin-off
arises
in
a
situation
where
a
corporation
has
a
subsidiary
and
distributes
the
stock
or
securities
in
the
subsidiary
to
its
shareholders
without
the
shareholders
giving
up
anything.
there
is
no
exchange.
the
general
theory
is
that
the
shareholders
have
two
pieces
of
paper
representing
the
same
interests
which
they
had
before.
now
where
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
complied
with,
it
is
provided
that
no
gain
or
loss
will
be
recognized
on
the
receipt
of
securities
in
a
spin-off.
the
problem
here
arises
on
these
facts.
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
which
we
will
call
pacific,
for
many
years
has
operated
telephone
service
in
california,
oregon,
washington
and
idaho,
and
through
a
subsidiary
in
nevada.
since
1907,
more
than
80%
of
the
voting
stock
of
pacific
has
been
held
by
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company.
and
in
1961,
which
is
the
year
and
the
only
year
before
the
court,
at&t
owned
about
90%
of
pacific's
common
stock,
about
78%
of
pacific's
preferred
stock,
and
had
nearly
90%
of
the
voting
power
in
pacific.
during
the
late
1950s
and
in
1960,
pacific
in
the
process
of
evolving
its
management
of
this
great
enterprise
developed
a
plan
to
decentralize
its
operations
by
separating
out
its
business
in
oregon,
washington
and
idaho.
it
organized
a
new
corporation
called
pacific
northwest
bell
telephone
company
and
which
we
refer
to
as
northwest
in
this
case.
in
creating
a
new
corporation,
it
transferred
a
small
amount
of
cash
to
northwest
for
stock
and
then
it
transferred
all
of
its
assets
in
oregon,
washington
and
idaho
to
northwest
in
exchange
for
the
balance
of
its
stock
and
debentures.
at
this
point,
july
1,
1961,
northwest
exists
as
a
complete
operating
corporation
wholly
owned
by
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
company.
if
pacific
had
then
distributed
all
of
the
northwest
stock
and
securities
to
its
shareholders,
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
spin-off
and
that
no
gain
or
loss
would
be
recognized.
indeed,
the
same
result
would
have
happened,
subject
to
certain
conditions,
if
pacific
had
distributed
at
least
80%
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
this
would
have
been
a
spin-off
and
thus
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
making
the
distribution
tax
free.
however,
pacific
chose
not
to
proceed
in
this
way
and
that's
why
the
problem
arises
here.
instead
of
distributing
all
of
the
stock
or
at
least
80%
of
it,
pacific
chose
to
issue
warrants
or
rights
to
its
shareholders
in
1961
through
which
they
or
persons
who
purchased
their
rights
could
buy
not
all
or
80%
but
57%
of
the
northwest
stock.
under
the
rights
offer,
it
took
six
rights
and
$16
to
acquire
a
share
of
northwest
stock
and
$16
was
less
than
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
so
that
the
rights
had
value.
at
the
time
when
these
rights
were
issued,
pacific
had
what
it
denominated
a
plan
in
which
it
was
stated
that
pacific
expected
to
dispose
of
the
rest
of
the
stock
through
further
issues
of
rights,
the
time
and
prices
to
be
determined
later.
however,
pacific
was
under
no
obligation
to
make
such
a
disposition.
it
did
in
fact
issue
further
rights
in
1963,
21
months
later.
as
a
result,
all
of
the
northwest
stock
was
eventually
disposed
of
either
to
the
pacific
shareholders
at
the
two
separated
points
of
time
or
to
the
persons
to
whom
such
shareholders
sold
their
rights.
in
the
first
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
the
gordon
case
number
760,
the
shareholder
received
rights
in
1962
and
exercised
them.
the
question
is
whether
he
had
income
from
this
transaction.
in
the
other
case
before
the
court,
the
bann
case,
number
781,
the
shareholder
exercised
all
of
his
rights
but
four.
as
i've
said,
it
took
six
rights
plus
$16
to
subscribe
to
a
share
of
northwest
stock.
mr.
bann
exercised
all
of
his
rights
that
he
could
to
get
full
shares,
but
he
had
four
leftover,
and
he
sold
those
four.
the
question
in
the
bann
case
with
respect
to
the
receipt
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
is
the
same
as
that
in
the
gordon
case.
in
the
bann
case
however,
there
is
the
additional
question
as
to
the
tax
liability
arising
with
respect
to
the
four
rights
which
were
not
exercised
but
were
sold.
at
the
time
the
transaction
was
under
consideration,
counsel
for
pacific
submitted
the
question
to
the
internal
revenue
service
for
a
ruling
and
that
ruling
is
set
out
in
full
at
page
146
of
the
record
dated
june
28,
1961
just
before
the
transfer
occurred.
the
service
rule
that
the
transaction
did
not
fall
within
section
355
and
that
the
shareholders
would
be
taxable.
of
course
that
ruling
isn't
binding
on
the
court.
i
mention
it
however
to
show
the
position
of
those
charged
with
administering
the
tax
laws
and
to
show
further
that
pacific
and
its
shareholders
were
not
taken
by
surprise
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
unfair
if
it
should
eventually
be
concluded
that
the
treasury's
contemporaneous
ruling
was
correct.
after
the
transaction
was
carried
out
and
returns
for
1961
had
been
filed,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
determined
deficiencies
against
the
two
taxpayers
now
before
the
court,
who,
as
i
have
indicated,
had
received
and
exercised
rights,
but
had
not
included
anything
in
their
tax
returns
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
the
taxpayers
filed
petition
for
review
with
the
tax
court.
in
a
careful
opinion
by
judge
raum,
the
taxpayers
prevailed
there.
judge
raum
held
that
since
a
distribution
of
the
northwest
shares
to
the
pacific
shareholders
without
payment
would
have
been
tax-free.
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
congress
intended
a
tax
liability
to
result
from
a
lesser
distribution,
that
is
an
offer
to
dispose
of
the
shares
at
a
price
through
rights
as
the
transaction
was
actually
carried
out.
from
the
decision
of
the
tax
court,
two
separate
appeals
were
taken;
one
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
gordon
case
and
the
other
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
bann
case.
the
second
circuit
decided
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
in
a
two-to-one
decision
with
judge
friendly
dissenting.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
in
favor
of
the
commissioner.
thus,
there
was
a
square
conflict
of
decisions.
both
sides
filed
petitions
for
certiorari
and
these
are
the
cases.
both
arise
on
the
same
record
which
are
now
before
the
court.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
arises
in
the
same
basic
area
as
was
involved
in
the
famous
gregory
case
in
293
u.s.
decided
in
1935,
i
suppose
all
tax
lawyers
would
agree
one
of
the
great
landmarks
in
the
tax
law.
the
gregory
case
involved
a
spin-off.
at
that
time,
this
was
an
area
which
had
come
to
be
used
very
widely
for
rather
blatant
tax
avoidance
which
was
the
situation
in
the
gregory
case
itself.
as
a
result,
not
only
was
the
gregory
decision
announced
from
this
court,
but
congress
repealed
the
provisions
which
had
been
included
in
the
earlier
revenue
laws
granting
tax-free
status
to
spin-offs.
and
there
was
no
provision
for
tax-free
status
of
spin-offs
between
1934
and
1951,
a
period
of
17
years.
now,
let
me
make
it
plain
that
in
this
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
substantial
and
legitimate
business
purpose
and
for
the
steps
which
pacific
took
with
respect
to
its
northwest
operations.
the
reference
to
the
gregory
case
however
does
seem
to
me
to
be
relevant
because
it
shows
that
congress
knew
that
this
was
a
delicate
area
with
substantial
tax
avoidance
potential.
as
a
result,
when
congress
first
restored
a
tax-free
status
to
some
spin-offs
in
1951,
it
included
careful
restrictions.
these
restrictions
were
extended
and
amplified
in
the
1954
code,
section
355
which
is
now
before
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
background
of
the
spin-off
provisions
and
the
language
which
congress
actually
used,
it
is
our
position
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
language
of
the
statute
would
be
carefully
read,
that
its
requirements
would
have
to
be
met,
and
that
it
could
not
be
given
a
broad
and
sweeping
construction.
the
statutory
provision
involved
here
is
the
same
sort
of
provision
as
that
relating
to
collapsible
corporations,
which
was
involved
in
braunstein
against
the
commissioner
in
374
u.s.
where
the
court
referred
to
the
statute
there
as
setting
up
“a
carefully
and
elaborately
defined
category
of
transactions”.
we
have
such
a
provision
here.
let
us
turn
then
to
the
statute
itself.
as
i've
said
at
the
opening
of
the
argument,
this
is
a
technical
tax
case.
much
of
the
technicality
is
developed
in
the
main
briefs
and
the
reply
briefs
which
have
been
filed
by
both
of
the
parties.
i'm
going
to
try
to
keep
my
argument
relatively
simple
focusing
attention
on
three
provisions
of
the
statute.
if
more
detail
is
wanted,
it
will
be
found
in
ample
amounts
in
the
briefs
which
have
been
prepared
for
the
court.
the
full
text
of
section
355
appears
at
several
places
in
the
papers
before
the
court.
the
place
to
which
i
shall
refer
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
main
brief,
the
usual
gray-covered
brief,
beginning
at
page
53
of
that
brief.
section
355
is
a
part
of
subchapter
(c)
in
the
internal
revenue
code
relating
to
corporate
distributions
and
reorganizations.
it
follows
section
351
which
deals
with
transfers
to
a
controlled
corporation
and
section
354
which
deals
with
exchanges
in
connection
with
a
reorganization.
section
355
is
itself
entitled
distribution
of
stock
and
securities
of
a
controlled
corporation.
as
you
will
see,
it's
a
long
provision
occupying
nearly
all
of
four
pages
in
the
brief.
generally
speaking
though,
we
need
be
concerned
only
with
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
page
53
and
the
top
of
page
54,
that
is
a
total
of
one
and
a
half
out
of
the
entire
four
pages.
the
rest
of
the
provision
is
important
as
a
part
of
the
setting
of
the
statute
since
it
illustrates
the
care
with
which
congress
drew
the
provision
and
its
apparent
concern
that
its
term
should
be
specific
and
carefully
safeguarded.
let
us
then
look
at
paragraph
(a)
(1)
of
section
355
as
it
begins
on
page
53
of
the
government's
brief.
it
starts
off
with
one
important
condition
imposing
word
‘if.
it
says,
“if
a
corporation
referred
to
in
this
section
as
the
distributing
corporation;
(i)
it
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock”,
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
or,
and
then
we
can
skip
(ii)
as
it
has
no
application
here,
what
does
the
corporation
distribute?
the
section
then
continues,
“solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation”,
referred
to
in
this
section
as
controlled
corporation,
which
it
controls
immediately
before
the
distribution.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
the
important
words
there
are
in
(i)
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
and
then
the
words
immediately
following
(ii)
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
now,
in
examining
this
statute,
we
can
skip
the
provisions
of
paragraphs
(b)
and
(c)
at
the
bottom
of
page
53
and
go
over
to
the
next
page,
page
54
of
the
government's
brief.
we
there
find
(d)
as
part
of
the
distribution.
the
distributing
corporation
distributes;
(i)
all
of
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution,
or,
and
then,
there's
a
longer
(ii)
and
which
makes
it
applicable
if
they
do
distribute
80%
and
certain
other
conditions
are
complied
with.
then,
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
to
and
no
amount
shall
be
includable
in
the
income
of
such
shareholder
or
security
holder
on
the
receipt
of
such
stock
or
securities,
which
is
a
consummation
devotedly
to
be
wished
by
any
taxpayer.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
what
was
actually
done
by
pacific's
management
here
meets
the
terms
of
the
provisions
of
section
355
to
which
i
referred.
mr.
griswold
that
relates
to
debt
securities,
mr.
justice.
if
they
had
distributed
for
example
debentures,
paragraph
(3)
says
that
paragraph
(1)
should
not
apply
--
mr.
griswold
security
does
not
apply
to
stock
--
mr.
griswold
and
that
is
only
inapplicable
because
securities
are
not
involved.
i
think
we
can
perhaps
have
some
discussion
as
to
whether
rights,
not
being
stocked,
are
securities,
but
that
isn't
directly
involved
here.
before
looking
at
these
specific
provisions
in
greater
detail,
i
may
observe
that
counsel
for
the
taxpayer,
if
i
may
so,
prefer
to
ignore
the
precise
language
of
the
statute.
they
advance
section
355
as
a
beneficent
provision
designed
to
be
applicable
to
bona
fide
spin-offs
of
all
sorts.
they
prefer
not
to
look
at
the
exact
text
of
the
--
detailed
statutory
provisions
which
congress
actually
wrote
and
wrote
with
care
in
the
light
of
its
experience
with
earlier
spin-off
provisions
in
the
gregory
case.
indeed,
in
the
first
51
pages
of
the
taxpayer's
brief
in
this
court,
they
speak
of
section
355
only
in
general
terms
and
make
no
reference
to
the
precise
language
which
the
congress
wrote.
mr.
griswold
frankly,
i
don't
know.
there
are
--
there
are
split-offs
which
occur
when
a
portion
of
the
business
is
taken
out
and
given
to
shareholders
in
exchange
for
some
of
their
stock,
a
split-off
involves
an
exchange.
there
are
split-ups
where
for
example,
the
business
is
divided
into
two
corporations
and
the
shares
in
those
two
corporations
are
then
distributed
to
the
shareholders
in
exchange
for
their
stock.
both
a
split-off
and
a
split-up
involved
an
exchange.
but
a
spin-off
is
applied
to
a
situation
where
there
is
no
exchange.
where
there
is
a
corporation
and
for
a
good
and
sufficient
reason,
a
portion
of
it
is
separated
out
and
that
stock
is
then
distributed
to
the
shareholders
of
the
original
corporation.
and
i
suppose
it
has
a
certain
picture
appeal,
that
as
long
as
i
can
remember
has
been
called
a
spin-off.
certainly
that
was
the
reference
that
was
made
in
the
gregory
case
which
goes
back
35
years
now.
mr.
griswold
this
--
this
case
would
have
been
a
spin-off
if
they
had
distributed
the
stock
in
pacific.
whether
or
not
it
is
a
spin-off,
we
will
learn
when
this
court
has
decided
the
case,
i
suppose.[laughter]
mr.
griswold
well,
i
referred
to
it
in
my
opening
statement
as
a
kind
of
a
spin-off
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
if
it's
not
a
spin-off,
it's
a
sale
of
the
pacific
stock
through
the
issuance
of
rights.
and
as
a
sale
of
the
pacific
stock
through
the
issuance
of
rights,
it
should
be
treated
as
a
sale
as
it
was
by
pacific
in
this
case.
pacific
made
a
gain
on
the
shares
which
it
sold
to
its
shareholders
and
reported
that
gain
for
tax
purposes
and
the
question
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
shareholders,
if
section
355
does
not
apply
because
it
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities,
then
turn
simply
on
the
other
general
provisions
of
the
statute
and
it
would
be
a
distribution
of
property
which
since
pacific
had
adequate
earnings
and
profits
would
be
a
dividend
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
griswold
no,
it
is
not
--
i'm
sorry,
i
referred
to
split-up
and
split-off,
but
section
355
does
relate
to
them
as
well
as
to
distributions
without
the
giving
up
of
any
other
property.
now,
it's
recognized
of
course
that
sometimes
statutes
are
read
rather
broadly
and
it
clearly
seen
objective
becomes
the
touchstone
to
interpretation.
in
other
situations,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
one,
the
statutes
are
written
in
a
highly
articulated
manner
and
are
clearly
designed
to
be
read
specifically
and
not
in
general
terms.
broadly
speaking,
i
think
that
this
is
the
line
on
which
this
case
will
be
determined.
if
one
looks
only
at
the
general
situation
as
the
taxpayers'
counsels
do
as
far
as
they
can,
reasons
may
be
found
which
will
lead
to
a
conclusion
their
way.
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
looks
at
the
statute
and
gives
a
fair
construction
to
the
language
actually
used
by
congress,
it
will
be
found
i
submit
that
the
conditions
of
the
statute
were
not
met
and
that
the
tax-free
status
sought
by
the
taxpayers
was
not
achieved.
so
let's
look
at
the
terms
of
the
statute
with
the
facts
of
the
case
in
mind.
in
doing
this,
i
would
recall
that
the
issue
arises
because
pacific
chose
to
use
warrants
or
rights
rather
than
distributing
the
northwest
stock
to
its
shareholders
outright.
if
pacific
had
done
the
latter
here,
there
would
be
no
problem.
why
should
the
result
be
different,
simply
because
they
did
something
less?
the
answer
is
i
think
that
the
one
would
have
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
statute
while
what
was
actually
done
did
not,
and
the
difference
is
not
entirely
formal
for
a
distribution
of
all
of
the
northwest
stock
to
the
pacific
shareholders
would
have
been
a
true
spin-off,
a
division
of
the
same
enterprise
into
two,
with
each
shareholder
of
pacific
now
owning
two
pieces
of
paper
to
represent
exactly
what
he
owned
before.
but
what
was
actually
done
was
quite
different
and
not
within
the
spirit
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
not
within
its
terms.
what
was
actually
done
was
a
refinancing
of
pacific,
a
sale
of
a
part
of
its
northwest
stock
in
1961
for
a
very
large
sum
of
money
which
reviews
for
the
expansion
of
pacific's
operations
in
california,
as
well
as
to
pay
off
part
of
its
indebtedness
to
at&t.
pacific
shareholders
did
not
simply
receive
the
northwest
stock
as
section
355
contemplates.
they
had
to
buy
it
and
to
put
large
sums
of
new
money
into
pacific
in
order
to
get
their
shares
in
northwest,
or
else
to
sell
or
lose
their
rights.
now,
how
does
this
fit
in
into
the
actual
terms
of
the
statute?
let's
look
again
at
the
beginning
of
section
355
(a)
(1)
(a).
if
a
corporation
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
did
pacific
distribute
northwest
stock
to
its
shareholders
with
respect
to
its
stock?
i
suggest
that
it
did
not.
in
actual
fact,
pacific
made
two
distributions
or
dispositions
in
1961.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
there
were
two
separate
mailings
of
distinct
items.
first
on
september
29,
1961,
it
distributed
rights
to
its
shareholders.
that
was
certainly
a
distribution
but
was
it
a
distributed
stock
in
northwest,
no,
rights
to
the
shareholders.
this
was
a
distribution
to
its
shareholders
with
respect
to
its
stock,
but
it
was
clearly
a
distribution
of
rights,
not
of
northwest
stock.
no
shareholder
received
northwest
stock
at
that
time
and
no
shareholder
would
receive
northwest
stock
at
a
later
time
unless
he
took
affirmative
steps
which
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
do.
at
a
somewhat
later
time,
pacific
did
sell
northwest
stock,
but
not
to
its
shareholders.
the
sales
were
made
to
the
then
holders
of
warrants
or
rights
who
might
or
might
not
have
been
shareholders
of
pacific.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
about
a
third
of
the
minority
shareholders
of
pacific
did
not
exercise
their
rights
and
did
not
receive
northwest
stock.
mr.
griswold
there
were
some
80,000
rights
that
expired,
but
several
hundred
thousand
which
must
have
been
sold.
there
--
these
were
traded
on
the
exchange.
there
was
a
–
a
before
issuance
market
and
a
market
during
all
the
time
that
they
were
outstanding.
this
is
what,
in
the
bann
case,
the
problem
we
had
with
respect
to
the
four
rights.
in
that
case,
they
sold
the
four
rights
and
the
question
arises
as
to
the
taxability
of
the
proceeds.
the
important
matter
in
the
application
of
the
statute
is
that
northwest
stock
was
not
distributed
to
the
pacific
shareholders.
it
was
in
fact
distributed
to
whatever
person's
owned
and
presented
the
rights,
together
with
$16
for
each
share
of
northwest
stock
to
be
acquired.
this
is
not
what
the
statute
says
and
the
refinancing,
which
was
carried
out
is
not
what
was
contemplated
when
the
statute
was
formulated.
one
element
in
that
picture,
which
i
think
is
relevant
is
that
the
spin-off
statute,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plainly
contemplates
that
the
size
of
the
distributing
corporation
will
be
reduced
after
the
distribution.
now,
you
have
a
corporation
which
has
a
subsidiary.
it
distributes
the
subsidiary
and
the
old
corporation
is
left
with
reduced
assets.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
book
value
is
concerned,
the
result
was
an
actual
increase
of
the
size
of
pacific
after
the
distribution
because
the
book
value
to
pacific
of
the
northwest
shares
was
less
than
the
$16
a
share
which
it
received
on
the
distribution
of
each
share.
that
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
capital
gain,
which
pacific
recognized
and
returned.
there's
one
element
in
this
picture,
which
makes
me
a
little
nervous.
it
was
suggested
for
the
first
time
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
when
the
second
circuit
said
that
well,
really,
this
was
a
distribution
of
northwest
stock
to
the
shareholders.
and
what
the
shareholders
did
then
was
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific.
they
treated
the
$16
as
a
--
or
they
said
it
could
be
treated
as
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific
rather
than
as
a
payment
of
the
purchase
price.
well
now,
if
it's
a
contribution
to
the
capital
of
pacific,
it
would
not
be
taxable
income
to
pacific,
and
i
see
lurking
in
the
background
here
a
claim
for
refund
by
pacific
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
contribution
to
capital.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
extremely
far-fetched.
the
transaction
was
referred
to
in
the
plan
as
an
offer
to
sell
the
shares.
it
was
understood
by
all
as
an
offer
to
sell
the
shares
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
sale,
both
in
this
case
and
with
respect
to
pacific.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
--
it
took
six
rights
and
$16
to
buy
one
share
of
northwest
and
the
market
value
of
the
northwest
stock
at
this
time
was
--
of
the
order
of
$26
a
share.
mr.
griswold
that
that
was
--
mr.
griswold
i
said
--
i
referred,
mr.
justice,
and
perhaps
it
was
misleading,
to
the
book
value
of
the
assets.
it
is
true
that
it
reduced
the
actual
value
of
the
assets
by
the
amount
of
the
spread.
but
the
book
value
of
the
northwest
shares,
which
was
based
upon
the
amount
of
money
which
pacific
had
invested
in
the
three
states
was
of
the
order
of
$14
or
$15
a
share,
so
that
the
$16
which
they
received
resulted
in
a
book
gain,
which
for
tax
purposes
would
have
to
be
recognized.
mr.
griswold
a
book
gain
but
an
actual
loss,
that
is
true,
an
actual
loss
of
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
northwest
shares
and
the
$16
a
share
--
mr.
griswold
$16
was
more
than
their
--
mr.
griswold
more
than
their
base
is.
what
they
paid
for
--
well,
their
bases
is
somewhat
complicated
because
it
involved
the
amount
that
they
had
invested
in
assets
in
those
three
states,
which
they
then
distributed
to
pacific
in
exchange
for
pacific's
stock.
now,
the
argument
that
i've
just
made
with
respect
to
355
(a)
(1)
(a)
(i)
applies
too
to
the
following
portion
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
there
be
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
and
i
would
point
out
that
that
word
‘solely'
was
added
in
1954
when
congress
enacted
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
the
corresponding
provision
which
was
put
in
1951
did
not
have
the
‘solely'
there.
now,
the
taxpayers
can't
have
it
both
ways,
it
seems
to
me.
either
there
was
a
distribution
of
rights,
in
which
case,
it
was
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
his
stock
but
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities.
or
there
was
a
distribution
of
northwest
stock,
although
it
was
more
accurately
a
sale,
in
which
case,
it
was
made
to
the
right
holders
and
thus
was
not
a
distribution
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock.
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
the
two
parts
were
some
sort
of
a
step
transaction
and
that
they
are
to
be
read
together.
even
that
will
not
bring
them
within
the
statute
as
written,
nor
will
it
mean
that
pacific
distributed
solely
stock
or
securities
in
northwest.
as
this
court
said
in
the
southwest
securities
corporation
case,
315
u.s.,
“solely'
leaves
no
leeway”.
what
pacific
distributed
here
was
rights
representing
an
obligation
against
pacific.
such
rights
are
not
solely
stock
in
northwest.
finally,
there's
another
provision
of
the
statute
which
was
not
met
here.
this
is
on
the
next
page,
page
54,
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
at
the
top
of
page
54.
it
provides
that
the
distributing
corporation.
here,
pacific,
must
distribute;
(i)
all
of
the
stock
and
securities
in
the
controlled
corporation
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution,
while
the
following
paragraph
(ii)
qualifies
this,
if
at
least
80%
of
the
stock
is
distributed.
in
this
case,
even
if
the
issuance
of
rights
in
the
sale
of
northwest
stock
in
1961,
is
treated
as
a
distribution
of
stock,
it
was
only
57%.
the
required
aggregate
of
at
least
80%
can
be
reached
only
if
the
1961
distribution
is
added
into
the
--
in
with
the
sale
of
the
remaining
43%
of
the
northwest
stock
which
did
not
occur
until
1963,
more
than
21
months
later.
and
the
important
thing
about
this
is
that
it
was
not
obligating
in
any
way
in
1961.
this
can
best
be
seen
by
examining
the
plan
for
reorganization
which
is
set
out
in
full
beginning
at
page
102
of
the
record,
and
i
would
call
your
attention
particularly
to
the
relevant
portions
of
the
plan
on
page
109.
this
was
carefully
drawn
so
as
not
to
subject
pacific
to
any
obligation
as
to
future
distributions.
note
the
first
line
on
page
109,
“it
is
expected
that
within
about
three
years,”
and
then
further
down
the
page,
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
third
line,
it's
provided
that
the
offering
price
will
be
determined
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
at
the
time
of
each
offering
and
then,
the
next
sentence
begins
it's
expected
that,
and
so
on.
now
plainly,
we
suggest
that
this
does
not
square
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
words
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
(i)
held
by
it
immediately
before
the
distribution
connote
some
sort
at
least
of
a
limited
time
within
which
the
distribution
of
all
of
the
stock
must
be
made.
mr.
griswold
to
some
extent,
mr.
justice,
you're
right.
on
the
other
hand,
the
consolidated
stipulation
of
facts,
which
begins
on
page
33,
contains
references
to
this
matter
in
the
safeguarding
of
the
position.
it
certainly
was
not
squarely
raised
and
presented
in
the
--
mr.
griswold
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
justice,
and
that
we
have
made
a
brief
reference
to
and
we
put
forth
in
our
brief
that
there
was
here
an
elaborate
stipulation
of
facts
which
set
forth
the
full
text
of
all
of
the
documents
including
a
good
many
internal
documents.
the
papers,
for
example,
which
were
presented
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
and
the
argument
that
we
made
arises
on
the
face
of
those
documents
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
evidence
could
have
been
presented
which
would
change
the
effect
of
those
documents.
after
all,
i
just
referred
to
the
text
of
the
plan
for
reorganization
and
bringing
in
a
witness
who
would
say,
“well,
we
didn't
really
mean
that.
what
we
had
in
mind
was
that
we
were
bound
to
do
it”.
it
seems
to
me
would
not
affect
the
situation.
now,
in
referring
to
the
reference
to
immediately
before
the
distribution
in
section
355
(a)
(1)
(d)
(i),
we
don't
suggest
that
everything
has
to
be
done
in
an
instant
or
even
on
the
same
day.
obviously,
time
for
the
mechanics
of
the
transaction
must
be
allowed,
but
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
limited
time
within
which
the
distribution
should
be
made.
if
it's
to
be
done
in
two
stages,
they
must
be
at
least
reasonably
close
together
and
what's
more
important,
committed
from
the
beginning.
otherwise,
it's
impossible
to
know
whether
the
first
distribution
complies
with
the
statute.
at
the
close
of
1961
and
at
the
close
of
1962,
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
determine
the
tax
liability
of
these
taxpayers
for
the
year
1961
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out
in
the
second
circuit
below.
that's
not
only
--
mr.
griswold
i
wouldn't
even
be
sure
of
that.
i
could
imagine
that
you
could
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
distribution
in
december,
a
distribution
in
february,
all
planned
and
committed,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
could
come
within
the
statute.
certainly,
it
makes
it
easier
if
it's
all
within
the
same
taxable
year.
our
only
position
is
that
when
they
are
widely
separated
and
quite
non-committed,
that
section
355,
in
the
light
of
this
language,
cannot
fairly
be
regarded
as
applying.
leaving
the
thing
in
limbo
for
21
months
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
basic
approach,
always
followed
by
congress'
annual
accounting
periods,
but
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
and
thus,
as
is
discussed
in
more
detail
in
our
briefs,
we
contend
that
the
disposition
or
sale
made
here
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
355
because
only
57%
of
the
stock
of
northwest
was
sold
in
1961,
and
there
was
no
commitment
to
dispose
off
the
rest
of
the
stock.
now,
there's
a
remaining
issue
in
the
bann
case,
number
781.
the
taxpayer
there
sold
four
of
his
rights
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
taxable
on
the
proceeds
at
capital
gain
rates.
we've
discussed
this
point
at
the
conclusion
of
our
main
brief.
it's
our
contention
that
the
decision
below
on
this
is
wrong
because
the
distribution
of
rights
did
not
come
within
section
355
as
it
was
obviously
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities
in
northwest.
indeed,
this
point
highlights
our
argument
on
the
main
point
in
the
case.
a
good
deal
of
reference
is
made
in
the
opinions
below
and
in
the
briefs
to
this
court's
decision
in
palmer
against
commissioner
back
in
302
u.s.
where
in
an
opinion
by
justice
stone,
it
was
held
that
the
issuance
of
rights
did
not
constitute
a
distribution
by
a
corporation.
the
premise
on
which
that
opinion
was
based
however
was
that
in
that
particular
case,
the
rights
were
issued
at
the
fair
market
value
of
the
distributed
stock
as
of
the
time
the
rights
were
determined
on.
there
is
a
language
in
the
palmer
case
which
it
seems
to
me
justice
stone
probably
would
be
reexamining
himself
if
he
were
here
to
do
it.
but
i
would
point
out
that
regardless
of
the
palmer
case
and
its
status
now,
the
congress
substantially
amended
the
statute
by
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
adding
a
whole
new
subchapter
(c)
spelling
out
in
much
greater
detail
the
provisions
with
respect
to
distributions.
and
we
would
contend
that
the
palmer
case
is
no
longer
applicable,
whether
it
was
rightly
or
wrongly
decided,
and
that
section
301
and
other
sections
of
the
code
squarely
call
for
the
treatment
of
the
rights
on
receipt
as
being
taxable
income.
now,
it
is
convenient
with
respect
to
rights
which
are
usually
short-lived
to
withhold
taxability
until
the
rights
have
been
disposed
of
and
to
treat
the
proceeds
of
the
rights
as
being
the
dividend
or
distribution.
and
ordinarily,
this
makes
no
difference,
although
we
suggest
that
the
better
analysis
is
to
say
that
the
rights
are
income
at
their
fair
market
value
when
they
are
received.
and
that
there
is
then
a
capital
gain
or
loss,
ordinarily
a
short-term
gain
or
loss,
on
the
sale
of
the
rights
depending
upon
whether
they
were
sold
for
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
than
they
were
worth
when
they
were
received.
in
this
case,
such
a
gain
or
loss
would
have
been
a
short-term
gain
or
loss
all
in
the
same
taxable
year
so
that
the
result
of
the
amount
--
the
result
of
taxing
the
amount
received
on
sale
is
a
convenient
and
wholly
accurate
way
to
treat
the
transaction,
but
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
dividend
distribution
and
not
in
any
sense
as
a
capital
gain
or
loss.
mr.
griswold
well,
roughly
here,
it
would
be
one-sixth
of
the
difference
between
$26
and
$16
or
about
a
$1.66
is
a
right.
it
would
actually
we
suggest
not
be
so
mechanically
determined
in
this
case
since
there
was
a
market,
an
active
market
for
these
shares.
it
would
be
determined
by
what
was
the
market
value
of
the
rights
on
the
date
of
receipt
and
there
was
--
it
did
run
out,
as
i
recall
it,
between
$1.60
and
$1.85,
one
or
two
days
a
little
higher
and
a
little
lower
per
right.
mr.
griswold
no.
i'm
only
--
only
contending
that
the
fair
market
value
of
the
right,
when
received,
should
be
treated
as
a
dividend.
mr.
griswold
that
then
if
the
right
is
sold
some
days
later,
there
is
technically
a
short-term
capital
gain
or
loss
on
the
right.
it
usually
isn't
very
much
and
being
short-term,
it's
treated
in
full
anyway
so
that
it's
easier
and
simpler,
and
it's
the
practice
usually
followed
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
continuing
wait
of
the
palmer
case,
then
what
you
do
is
look
and
see
what
did
he
sell
the
right
for
and
then
treat
that
as
a
dividend.
i'm
only
suggesting
that
though
that's
convenient
and
is
acceptable
to
us
that
perhaps
from
an
excessively
pedantic
point
of
view,
the
analysis
would
be
that
the
distribution
of
the
right
is
a
dividend,
that
it
is
viewed
as
whole
property.
it
can
go
up
or
down
in
value
and
if
it
goes
up
or
down
in
value,
the
difference
between
what
you
get
for
it
and
its
value
when
you
received
it
would
be
a
short-term
capital
gain
or
loss.
mr.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
make
--
we
make
two
arguments
under
355
(a)
(1)
(a);
one
with
respect
to
distributes
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock,
and
the
other
with
respect
to
solely
stock
or
securities
of
a
corporation.
and
then,
we
make
an
argument
under
(d),
d
for
detroit,
we
make
no
argument
under
(b)
or
(c)
and
--
mr.
griswold
those
are
the
two
provisions
of
the
statute
upon
which
we
specifically
relied.
mr.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
if
we
are
right
on
either
one,
then
the
taxpayer
does
not
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
thought
he
made
it
referenced
to
both,
but
he
did
refer
to
d
particularly.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
because
it
is
not
solely
stock
or
securities.
mr.
griswold
there
again,
that
--
that
would
be
exactly
what
was
involved
in
southwest
consolidated.
the
court
there
held
that
warrants
were
not
stock
and
therefore,
it
was
not
a
distribution
of
solely
stock
or
securities.
we
would
take
the
same
position
here.
mr.
griswold
for
the
reasons
indicated,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
gordon
case
number
760
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
bann
case
number
781
should
be
reversed
on
both
questions
raised.
mr.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
full
quotation
from
the
committee
report
is
given
accurately
in
the
taxpayers
brief
in
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
and
34
and
i
have
--
i
agree
with
it
entirely.
the
congress
wasn't
trying
to
remove
unwarranted
restrictions,
unnecessary
or
desirable
business
practices
but
it
was
also
including
provisions
to
ensure
that
this
would
not
be
misused
and
there's
nothing
in
that
paragraph
in
the
committee
report
which
even
suggest
that
the
language
which
the
congress
actually
used
in
the
statute
is
not
to
be
read
as
having
its
meaning
and
to
be
applied
the
way
it
was
written,
and
that
gets
us
back
to
our
contentions
about
the
three
particular
paragraphs
of
the
statute
where
it
seems
to
us
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
were
not
met
by
the
distribution
of
rights
as
distinguished
from
the
distribution
of
shares.
the
counsel
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
rights
were
used
here
because
there
were
difficulties
under
california
law
and
they
couldn't
have
distributed
the
shares.
i
think
that's,
perhaps,
exaggerated.
pacific
had
able
counsel
here
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
above
or
beyond
their
capacities
to
have
developed
a
recapitalization
which
would
have
produced
capital
surplus,
which
would
have
enabled
the
distribution
to
be
made
if
that's
what
they'd
wanted
to
do.
the
fact
was
that
they
wanted
very
much,
they
needed
desperately,
we're
fortunate
that
we
have
an
excellent
management
available
there.
they
need
it
desperately
to
have
large
amounts
of
new
capital
to
provide
for
the
rapid
growth
of
the
business
in
california
and
as
the
tax
court
pointed
out
on
its
opinion
on
page
240
of
the
record,
this
was
the
dominating
factor
which
determined
their
use
of
rights
rather
than
the
distribution
of
stock.
then
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
rights
are
property,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
one
other
problems
in
this
case
is
that
both
sides
have
to
try
to
deal
somehow
or
other
with
the
palmer
case.
i
don't
think
that
the
palmer
case
is
a
barrier
to
the
government's
position
here
nor
necessarily
a
barrier
to
the
taxpayers'
position,
but
i
think
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
rights
are
a
property.
all
one
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
consider
a
theft
of
the
envelope
containing
the
rights
or
a
question
of
property
tax
liability
with
respect
to
rights.
and
there
is
a
very
important
factor
here
in
that
congress
didn't
make
changes
in
1954
and
they
were
more
substantial
than
my
other
learned
brother
has
indicated.
i
would
call
a
particular
attention
to
section
317
which
is
new
in
the
1954
code
and
which
defines
property
in
such
a
way
as
clearly
to
include
rights
to
subscribe
to
shares
in
another
corporation.
we
would
welcome
a
reexamination
and
a
clarification
of
the
palmer
case
along
the
lines
indicated
in
our
brief.
