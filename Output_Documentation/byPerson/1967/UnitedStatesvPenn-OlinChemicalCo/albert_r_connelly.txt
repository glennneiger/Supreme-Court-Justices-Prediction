mr.
albert
r.
connelly
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
of
the
two
points
argued
by
the
appellant,
i
propose
to
address
myself
to
the
first,
that
is
to
say
to
the
correctness
of
the
finding
of
fact,
not
the
conclusion,
by
the
court
below
as
to
the
probability
of
independent
entry
by
either
pennsalt
or
olin
if
there
had
not
been
a
joint
venture.
and
mr.
delone
will
take
up
the
second
and
separate
question
as
to
whether
assuming
the
probability
of
independent
entry
by
one
whether
the
joint
venture
or
close
competition
by
the
other
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
substantially
lessen
the
competition.
the
keystone
fact
in
this
case,
the
one
which
in
my
view
distinguishes
it
from
any
other
section
7
case
that
has
come
before
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
neither
party
to
this
joint
venture
had
been
or
was
a
producer
in
the
marketplace.
we
suggest
two
potential
competitors,
potential
entrants
neither
of
which
within
the
market.
now,
if
a
merger
or
combination
involves
one
company
that
is
in
the
market,
actual
competitors
with
another
which
might
be
another
actual
competitor
or
even
a
potential
competitor,
there
is
some
subtraction
from
the
total
competitors
seen.
and
therefore
the
inquiry
proceeds
directly
to
whether
there
is
a
probability
that
that
merger,
that
combination
will
result
in
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
here,
there
wasn't
any
subtraction.
the
combination
brought
into
the
marketplace
like
an
additional
increase
in
competition
and
there
is
no
question
concerning
the
lessening
of
competition
unless
there
is
first
found
to
be
a
factual
probability,
an
absent
to
joint
venture
one
or
the
other
would
have
entered
the
market
anytime.
that
keystone
fact
has
two
aspects
which
i
think
are
of
significance,
number
one,
a
conceptual
aspect
and
two,
a
temporal
aspect.
a
conceptual
aspect
is
that
this
first
preliminary
issue
of
probability
is
not
an
antitrust
issue
at
all.
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
probability
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition,
that
involved
looking
at
the
structure
of
the
market
concentration,
character,
nature,
and
extent
of
other
competition,
it
requires
consideration
of
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
preliminary
question
which
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
one
company
as
a
matter
of
probability
would
or
would
not
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture
is
solely
a
factual
question
and
exactly
the
same,
granted
that
it's
a
very
simply
factual
question,
exactly
the
same
whatever
the
context
of
the
law
under
which
the
proceeding
had
brought.
the
second
aspect
of
this
keystone
fact
is
the
temporal
aspect
and
that
is
that
the
question
of
probability
of
independent
entry.
right
now
i'm
talking
about
the
probability
of
substantial
estimate
competition,
the
probability
of
independent
entrant
is
to
be
looked
at
and
measured
not
at
the
time
of
the
venture
but
prospectively.
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
clark
when
this
case
was
here
on
the
first
appeal
recognized
that,
all
he
said
is
at
page
173
or
four.
the
difference
of
course,
the
difference,
he
is
measuring
the
difference
between
a
merger
which
involves
somebody
who
was
actually
in
the
marketplace
in
a
country
and
the
joint
venture
which
involved
the
two
potentials.
the
difference
of
course
is
that
the
merger's
foreclosure
is
present
while
the
joint
venture
is
prospective.
the
appellant
recognized
that
in
its
main
brief
at
page
30
when
it
stated
its
position,
that
if
the
parties
had
not
gone
--
followed
with
the
joint
venture,
sooner
or
later,
one
of
the
firms
would
have
entered
the
market.
now
here,
the
appellant
would
nevertheless
exclude
as
irrelevant
all
post
transaction
facts
which
they
say
were
not
apparent,
they
don't
say
apparent
to
whom,
but
which
were
not
apparent
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
that
argument
misses
the
point
completely.
even
on
the
issue
of
the
probability
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition,
section
7
speaks
of
probable
effects,
the
probability
rule
permits
a
forecast,
would
be
--
requires
a
forecast
on
whatever
facts
are
available
at
the
time
the
decision
is
reached.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
require
a
disregard
of
facts
that
are
known
at
the
time
the
decision
is
made
to
the
extent
that
those
facts
bear
upon
the
central
issue
of
probability.
the
timing
will
depend
upon
the
time
of
the
trial
in
relation
to
the
transaction,
can
run
all
the
way
from
the
situation
that
existed
both
in
youngstown
and
the
court
was
considering
that
merger,
before
that
have
taken
place,
therefore
all
of
the
facts
were
prospective
do
the
decision
in
dupont
general
motors
where
40
years
after
the
event,
they
undertook
to
consider
that
question
in
the
light
of
facts
which
it
included,
the
facts
in
the
intervening
40
years.
on
the
issue
--
this
preliminary
issue
to
which
i
am
addressing
myself
is
to
say
the
probability
of
independent
entry
sooner
or
later
after
august
1960.
and
the
appellant
doesn't
give
us
any
clue
as
to
when
he
says
--
when
they
say
that
this
independent
entry
would
have
taken
place
anytime
was
in
the
broad
definition
of
sooner
or
later.
the
facts
as
to
what
happened
in
the
marketplace
during
that
period,
during
which
they
say
one
of
the
companies
would've
entered,
they
may
be
subject
to
explanation,
they
may
be
--
the
weight
to
be
given
to
them
has
to
be
considered
but
they're
clearly
relevant
to
that
central
issue
of
probability.
this
appeal
really
presents
nothing
more
than
a
difference
of
views
as
between
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
district
court
on
the
other.
obviously
we
concur
in
the
district
court's
views
as
to
the
weight
of
evidence.
in
that
connection,
mr.
justice
white
i
asked
about
of
the
opinion
dealt
--
with
decisions
made
by
the
parties,
i
hope
your
honors
will
have
in
mind
that
there
were
two
full
and
complete
and
detailed
opinions
written
there.
and
that
both
of
those
opinions
must
be
looked
at
to
exact
--
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
painstaking
care
that
the
district
court
gave
to
all
of
the
evidence,
not
just
the
part
of
the
evidence
but
to
all
of
the
evidence.
and
in
an
effort
to
inject
into
this
factual
weight
of
evidence
question,
some
notion
of
a
legal
question
or
a
law
question,
the
appellant
asked
this
court
now
to
adopt
some
new
rule
which
would
describe
decisive
weight
to
what
the
appellant
terms
objective
evidence
and
which
would
accord
little
or
no
link
to
what
the
appellant
describes
in
the
subjective
evidence.
that
is
described
from
time
to
time
as
a
legal
question
or
a
question
of
law
in
the
appellants
brief
whether
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
10
there
it
ultimately,
whether
inadvertent
or
not,
the
concession
that
the
question
really
is
one
of
the
relative
weight
of
evidence.
on
this
objective
--
subjective
determination
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
we
referred
to
what
we
regard
as
the
inadequacies
of
appellant's
definition,
the
so-called
rule
to
the
inconsistencies
and
its
application
depending
upon
whether
the
evidence
to
be
looked
at
is
favorable
or
unfavorable
to
the
government.
we
don't
propose
to
argue
semantics
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
that
--
its
in
weight
of
evidence
between
on
the
one
hand,
hypothetical
testimony
by
a
corporate
executive
at
the
trial
as
to
what
he
would've
done
if
penn-olin
had
not
been
formed.
and
on
the
other
hand
evidence
where
the
testimonial
or
document
relating
to
the
contemporaneous
acts,
decisions,
and
the
thinking
of
the
persons
who
were
responsible
for
making
the
decision
to
enter
if
any
such
decision
was
to
be
made.
we
do
not
contend
and
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
there
is
any
requirement
imposed
upon
appellant
to
sustain
its
verdict
to
establish
a
direct
evidence,
and
intent
to
enter
or
decision
to
enter
is
simply
was
not
the
holding
of
this
court.
we
do
say
that
in
looking
at
that
question
deciding
what
the
probability
is,
it
would
be
irrational
to
exclude
consideration
of
what
was
actually
done,
the
actual
decisions
were
reached
by
the
people
who
are
going
to
make
that
decision.
i
point
out
also
that
on
the
record
on
remand,
the
defendants
did
introduce
substantial
additional
evidence
on
external
facts
as
well
as
additional
evidence
on
the
internal
consideration.
i
think
it's
important
in,
your
honors
looking
at
this
situation
to
get
a
little
perspective
on
the
market
that
has
been
talked
about
so
knowingly.
in
1960,
the
entire
demand
in
the
southeast
market
amounted
to
only
47,000
tons
of
sodium
chlorate
with
a
market
price
of
less
than
$8
million.
and
during
the
five
years
or
four
years,
that
--
five
years
that
elapsed
between
the
first
--
the
joint
venture
and
the
time
of
the
second
trial,
the
increase
had
been
less
than
twice
in
that
amount.
those
--
that
dollar
figure
can
appropriately
be
compared
with
the
multimillion
dollar
industries
that
your
honors
had
considered
on
other
cases.
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
rapidly
growing
industry
in
that
southeastern
market
and
that
it
had
growing
at
some
10%
or
12%
year
on
the
average.
but
the
basis
for
that
growth
clearly
brought
out
on
the
remand
trial
was
that
conversion
of
the
pulp
and
paper
manufacturers
in
the
southeast
to
the
chlorine
dioxide
method
of
bleaching
is
introduced
into
the
market,
new
customers
for
the
product.
there
came
a
time
however
when
that
opportunity
of
going
in
that
direction
was
exhausted
and
the
testimony
of
the
second
trial
is
that
by
1964
that
had
been
rather
substantially
completed
but
from
there
on
in
that
rate
of
growth
would
be
alive
and
the
rate
of
growth
in
the
pulp
and
paper
industry
itself.
there
was
no
longer
that
opportunity
to
add
new
pulp
and
paper
management
in
custody.
and
by
1965,
the
rate
had
in
fact
slowed
down
to
about
5%
or
6%
a
year.
and
looking
at
that
market
from
the
standpoint
of
demand,
there
was
then
in
the
market
hooker
and
american
potash
company
which
then
had,
going
back
to
1960,
productive
capacities
sufficient
to
supply
the
entire
market.
as
the
court
below
noted,
they
were
multimillion
dollar
companies,
they
had
adequate
resources
to
expand
their
facilities
to
meet
any
anticipatory
demand
that
might
be
created
in
the
market.
now,
against
that
background,
the
cost
of
putting
a
plant
in,
in
the
southeast,
was
not
high
in
any
absolute
sense.
testimony
is
that
a
15,000-ton
plant
would
have
cost
about
$4
million,
25,000-ton
plant
about
$7
million.
but
in
relation
to
the
size
of
the
market
that
was
a
high
price
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
entering
the
market
in
trying
to
take
the
small
share
away
from
hooker
and
american
potash.
to
make
those
that
definition
of
the
market
is
important
in
considering
what
kind
of
consideration
was
given
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
pennsalt
and
olin.
each
of
them
had
considered
the
possibility
of
an
entry
for
years.
then,
at
least
the
ninth
--
middle
1950's,
pennsalt
gave
serious
consideration
to
it,
conducted
a
number
of
studies,
and
the
highest
projection
that
it
could
make
as
to
possible
return
on
investment
was
something
in
the
order
of
16%,
3.9
to
be
precise.
pennsalt
figured
its
estimate
returns
on
the
basis
of
before
taxes,
and
olin
after
taxes
so
there
was
some
confusion,
though,
they'll
have
that
in
mind.
it
was
at
that
point
in
1957,
that
the
pennsalt
management
determined
that
independent
entry
was
not
a
possibility
to
them.
the
investment
policy
of
pennsalt
had
been
--
for
some
time
had
been,
that
in
this
kind
of
venture.
that
they
had
to
have
a
projective
return
of
at
least
25%
before
taxes
to
make
the
investment
at
all
attractive
and
that's
it.
the
existence
of
that
investment
policy
was
brought
out
on
the
--
the
first
trial,
also
at
the
second
trial,
still
continued
in
producing
useful
results.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
second
trial
took
two
weeks.
now
there
was
consideration
given
by
pennsalt
in
1958
and
1959
that
the
possibility
of
a
sodium
chlorate
plant,
not
on
it's
own,
but
in
combination
with
ammonium
perchlorate,
just
a
the
word
about
that
perchlorate
because
it
really
goes
out
of
the
picture
entirely
very
shortly.
it
did
have
1957-1958
real
promise
as
a
possible
growth
product.
used
as
a
rocket
propellant
and
there
was
estimates
made
that
the
demand
would
increase
by
40%
in
1959
and
by
a
140%
perhaps
in
1961.
and
early
in
1958,
pennsalt
did
in
fact
put
up
a
small
pilot
plant
of
its
west
coast
portland
plant.
and
that
plant
was
expanded
with
commercial
production
in
about
2000
tons
in
february
of
1959.
they
did
consider,
november
of
1958
in
carrying
on
to
the
early
part
of
1959
the
possibility
of
putting
a
combination
of
those
two
together
in
the
southeast,
but
increasing
doubts
as
to
the
demand
for
ammonium
perchlorate
led
to
the
conclusion,
led
to
the
loss
of
interest
in
it
in
early
1959.
in
august
of
1960,
the
defense
department
advised
that
there
was
then
a
substantial
excess
of
capacity
of
perchlorate
and
would
continue
at
least
for
the
next
two
or
three
years.
footnote
on
that,
perchlorate
story,
by
1964
the
market
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
pennsalt
closed
its
west
coast
plant.
the
appellant
asked
us
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
pennsalt
went
into
the
joint
venture
at
all.
and
had
it
got
been
for
the
joint
venture,
it
could
be
counted
on
to
go
in
by
itself.
that
argument
ignores
the
essential
difference
that
exists
between
the
joint
venture
and
independent
entry.
penn-olin
estimates
called
for
a
plant
finally
at
26,500
tons
and
cost
to
$7.5
million
of
which
4.5
was
to
borrowed
by
penn-olin
requiring
an
equity
investment
of
only
$1.5
million
by
each
of
the
parents.
this
meant
that
the
joint
venture
offered
a
--
the
economics
of
a
larger
plant
that
either
would
have
considered
on
its
own.
it
offered
the
opportunity
of
combining
pennsalt's
production
experience
with
olin's
sales
experience
in
the
southeast,
thereby
providing
a
greater
opportunity
for
competition
with
american
potash
and
hooker.
it
provided
by
this
borrowing
device
that
the
penn-olin
had
a
50%
subsidiary,
the
borrowings
of
penn-olin
would
not
show
up
on
the
balance
sheet
and
therefore
not
affect
the
debt
ratios
either
of
pennsalt
or
olin.
this
meant
a
substantially
higher
return
on
the
equity.
pennsalt
estimate
was
that
for
the
penn-olin
plan,
a
return
on
the
total
investment
would
be
some
11.8%
before
taxes,
but
for
pennsalt
its
investment
amounted
to
31%,
and
that
was
the
one
way
that
the
joint
venture
provided
the
only
way
for
pennsalt
could
achieve
an
attractive
enough
return
to
meet
its
minimum
standards.
olin
likewise
gave
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
independent
entry
beginning
in
the
middle
of
1950's.
in
1958
and
1959,
it
entered
into
a
test
marketing
project
with
pennsalt
whereby
olin
sold
in
this
market,
in
the
southeast
market,
to
see
what
the
possibilities
were
for
getting
into
it.
in
april
of
1959,
the
first
and
only
recommendation
was
made
by
olin's
chemical
division
which
was
to
put
up
a
15,000-ton
plant,
the
cost
of
$4
million
with
a
projected
after
tax
return
of
11%.
that
proposal
was
rejected
by
the
olin
management.
that
was
a
managerial
position
at
that
time.
it
is
true
that
subsequently,
talks
of
the
joint
venture
late
in
1959
led
to
a
consideration,
a
conclusion,
go
in
to
the
joint
venture
in
1960.
the
argument
that
the
appellant
makes
that
we'll
perhaps
there
had
been
a
different
decision.
there
had
not
been
talks
of
the
joint
venture.
if
by
that,
the
appellant
means
that
we
take
the
position
that
olin's
rejection
of
the
proposal
is
conclusive
could
simply
eliminates
the
possibility
that
olin
would
have
any
interest
at
anytime
in
going
in,
of
course
we
agree
with
it.
but
i
take
that
the
burden
on
it
is
not
upon
us
to
establish
the
impossibility
of
all
endeavor
going
in
independently
but
rather
the
burden
is
on
the
government
who
established
a
probability
that
one
or
the
other
would
have
gone
in.
and
on
that
issue,
the
issue
of
probability,
i
ask
your
honors
to
think
on
--
and
look
only
two
things.
first,
after
this
letter
of
intent,
february
of
1960
that
they
entered
into,
olin
reconsidered
even
the
desirability
of
going
into
the
much
more
attractive
joint
venture.
and
it
wasn't
finally
approved
until
august
1960
after
there
had
been
significant
changes
made,
the
capacity
--
the
rated
capacity
of
the
plant
had
been
increased.
after
then
redesigned
to
bring
about
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
cost
and
there
was
a
further
redesign
in
engineering
to
produce
an
improvement
in
the
estimated
rate
of
return.
if,
as
you
consider,
the
potential
to
what
olin
was
considering
about
the
more
attractive
joint
venture,
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
with
those
circumstances
existing
that
olin
would
nevertheless
had
went
ahead
independent.
now,
we
point
also
to
evidence
concerning
other
large
number
of
other
potential
merchant
producers
of
sodium
chlorate
who
were
giving
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
entry
in
the
same
market.
but
this
evidence
on
the
other
potential
merchant
producers
has
a
dual
relevance.
it
bears
upon
the
question
of
the
lessening
of
competition
issue
because
it
bears
upon
the
impact
if
any
of
that
potential
commission
--
competition
had
upon
the
market.
but
it's
also
bears
upon
my
issue
of
probability
because
here
are
companies
that
had
exactly
the
same
capacity
that
is
described
to
pennsalt
and
olin,
and
that
be
the
same
interest
in
terms
of
sustained
consideration,
and
yet
they
did
not
in
fact
reached
the
decision
to
enter
the
market
independently.
to
mention
just
a
few
here,
allied
chemical
which
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeastern
market
which
was
indeed
actually
engaged
in
the
sale
of
sodium
chlorate
in
that
market,
as
sales
agent
for
american
potash
and
its
predecessor
from
1950
right
through
1965.
it
gave
periodic
consideration
and
studied
the
possibility
of
putting
up
a
plant
on
its
own.it
never
reached
the
point
of
finding
it
attractive
(inaudible).
fmc
or
food
machinery
corporation,
it
also
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast,
engaged
in
the
sale
of
chemicals
to
the
pulp
and
paper
industry,
it
conducted
chlorate
studies,
almost
yearly
or
at
least
by
two-year
gaps
throughout
the
period
in
1954
to
1964,
negative
results.
diamond
alkali,
it
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast.
it
conducted
--
it
made
sales
to
the
pulp
and
paper
industry.
it
conducted
studies,
intensive
studies
in
1958
and
1959
which
led
to
a
formal
recommendation
by
staff,
the
management,
of
entry
into
the
market,
and
that
recommendation
was
rejected.
wyandotte
is
another.
it
also
had
the
same
situation
with
reference
to
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast,
sales
of
chemicals
to
pulp
and
paper
companies,
studies
in
1952
and
1953,
again,
in
1959,
and
no
decisions
to
going
up.
each
of
those
companies
as
well
as
others
that
will
be
mentioned
on
this
(inaudible)
--
each
of
those
companies
had
the
capacity
to
enter
the
field,
each
of
the
companies
considered
it.
they
had
an
active
interest.
on
appellant's
theory,
all
of
those
were
not
merely
potential,
but
were
probable
entrants
and
yet
throughout
all
of
those
years
none
of
them
in
fact
have
entered.
the
only
company
that
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes
sir?
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
think
as
mr.
delone
will
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
it
could
well
be
sir,
in
terms
of
certain
industry,
but
not
in
this
industry
because
the
testimony
is
quite
clear.
that
the
only
price
effect
of
potential
competition
came
not
from
the
existence
of
this
large
number
of
possible
entrants
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
--
the
pulp
and
paper
companies
start
--
of
starting
production
on
their
own.
again,
that's
a
subject
to
be
developed
in
(inaudible)
next
by
mr.
delone.
now,
the
only
company
did
in
fact
was
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
1961,
that
significant
is
the
only
company
in
this
large
group
i
have
referred
to
which
combined
manufacturing
experience
in
sodium
chlorate,
had
a
plant
in
canada,
and
selling
experience
in
the
southeast
from
its
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast.
that's
a
combination,
the
pennsalt
and
olin
were
able
to
achieve
only
by
the
joint
venture.
during
this
entire
period
of
time,
during
the
1950's
and
up
to
august
of
1960,
although
each
of
these
companies
gave
consideration
to
possibility
of
entry,
neither
company
was
able
to
justify
entry.
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
market
was
expanding
rapidly,
at
that
time
there
were
only
two
producers
in
the
market,
at
that
time
the
price
levels
appeared
to
be
burdened.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
period
of
time
after
august
1960,
the
sooner
or
later
period
during
which
the
appellant
says
that
it
is
probably
that
either
one
or
the
other
that
it
--
they
find
not
only
in
the
increase
in
the
probability,
they
find
that
the
market
becomes
less
and
less
attractive,
first,
with
the
entry
of
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
1961.
that
made
a
--
in
a
small
market
three
producers
rather
than
the
two
that
existed
formally.
secondly,
a
thread
of
captive
production
by
the
pulp
and
paper
companies,
again,
in
the
early
60's,
a
development
which
you
had
--
if
it
had
fully
materialized
would
reduce
the
demand
by
some
55%
and
finally,
in
1964
an
actual
price
reduction
of
approximately
9%.
all
the
market
facts
since
1960
in
our
view
make
even
more
able
to
do
the
possibility
of
independent
entry
by
either
company
had
the
joint
venture
not
on
olin,
and
in
our
submission,
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
this
issue
is
clearly
correct.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
of
the
two
points
argued
by
the
appellant,
i
propose
to
address
myself
to
the
first,
that
is
to
say
to
the
correctness
of
the
finding
of
fact,
not
the
conclusion,
by
the
court
below
as
to
the
probability
of
independent
entry
by
either
pennsalt
or
olin
if
there
had
not
been
a
joint
venture.
and
mr.
delone
will
take
up
the
second
and
separate
question
as
to
whether
assuming
the
probability
of
independent
entry
by
one
whether
the
joint
venture
or
close
competition
by
the
other
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
substantially
lessen
the
competition.
the
keystone
fact
in
this
case,
the
one
which
in
my
view
distinguishes
it
from
any
other
section
7
case
that
has
come
before
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
neither
party
to
this
joint
venture
had
been
or
was
a
producer
in
the
marketplace.
we
suggest
two
potential
competitors,
potential
entrants
neither
of
which
within
the
market.
now,
if
a
merger
or
combination
involves
one
company
that
is
in
the
market,
actual
competitors
with
another
which
might
be
another
actual
competitor
or
even
a
potential
competitor,
there
is
some
subtraction
from
the
total
competitors
seen.
and
therefore
the
inquiry
proceeds
directly
to
whether
there
is
a
probability
that
that
merger,
that
combination
will
result
in
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
here,
there
wasn't
any
subtraction.
the
combination
brought
into
the
marketplace
like
an
additional
increase
in
competition
and
there
is
no
question
concerning
the
lessening
of
competition
unless
there
is
first
found
to
be
a
factual
probability,
an
absent
to
joint
venture
one
or
the
other
would
have
entered
the
market
anytime.
that
keystone
fact
has
two
aspects
which
i
think
are
of
significance,
number
one,
a
conceptual
aspect
and
two,
a
temporal
aspect.
a
conceptual
aspect
is
that
this
first
preliminary
issue
of
probability
is
not
an
antitrust
issue
at
all.
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
probability
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition,
that
involved
looking
at
the
structure
of
the
market
concentration,
character,
nature,
and
extent
of
other
competition,
it
requires
consideration
of
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
preliminary
question
which
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
one
company
as
a
matter
of
probability
would
or
would
not
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture
is
solely
a
factual
question
and
exactly
the
same,
granted
that
it's
a
very
simply
factual
question,
exactly
the
same
whatever
the
context
of
the
law
under
which
the
proceeding
had
brought.
the
second
aspect
of
this
keystone
fact
is
the
temporal
aspect
and
that
is
that
the
question
of
probability
of
independent
entry.
right
now
i'm
talking
about
the
probability
of
substantial
estimate
competition,
the
probability
of
independent
entrant
is
to
be
looked
at
and
measured
not
at
the
time
of
the
venture
but
prospectively.
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
clark
when
this
case
was
here
on
the
first
appeal
recognized
that,
all
he
said
is
at
page
173
or
four.
the
difference
of
course,
the
difference,
he
is
measuring
the
difference
between
a
merger
which
involves
somebody
who
was
actually
in
the
marketplace
in
a
country
and
the
joint
venture
which
involved
the
two
potentials.
the
difference
of
course
is
that
the
merger's
foreclosure
is
present
while
the
joint
venture
is
prospective.
the
appellant
recognized
that
in
its
main
brief
at
page
30
when
it
stated
its
position,
that
if
the
parties
had
not
gone
--
followed
with
the
joint
venture,
sooner
or
later,
one
of
the
firms
would
have
entered
the
market.
now
here,
the
appellant
would
nevertheless
exclude
as
irrelevant
all
post
transaction
facts
which
they
say
were
not
apparent,
they
don't
say
apparent
to
whom,
but
which
were
not
apparent
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
that
argument
misses
the
point
completely.
even
on
the
issue
of
the
probability
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition,
section
7
speaks
of
probable
effects,
the
probability
rule
permits
a
forecast,
would
be
--
requires
a
forecast
on
whatever
facts
are
available
at
the
time
the
decision
is
reached.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
require
a
disregard
of
facts
that
are
known
at
the
time
the
decision
is
made
to
the
extent
that
those
facts
bear
upon
the
central
issue
of
probability.
the
timing
will
depend
upon
the
time
of
the
trial
in
relation
to
the
transaction,
can
run
all
the
way
from
the
situation
that
existed
both
in
youngstown
and
the
court
was
considering
that
merger,
before
that
have
taken
place,
therefore
all
of
the
facts
were
prospective
do
the
decision
in
dupont
general
motors
where
40
years
after
the
event,
they
undertook
to
consider
that
question
in
the
light
of
facts
which
it
included,
the
facts
in
the
intervening
40
years.
on
the
issue
--
this
preliminary
issue
to
which
i
am
addressing
myself
is
to
say
the
probability
of
independent
entry
sooner
or
later
after
august
1960.
and
the
appellant
doesn't
give
us
any
clue
as
to
when
he
says
--
when
they
say
that
this
independent
entry
would
have
taken
place
anytime
was
in
the
broad
definition
of
sooner
or
later.
the
facts
as
to
what
happened
in
the
marketplace
during
that
period,
during
which
they
say
one
of
the
companies
would've
entered,
they
may
be
subject
to
explanation,
they
may
be
--
the
weight
to
be
given
to
them
has
to
be
considered
but
they're
clearly
relevant
to
that
central
issue
of
probability.
this
appeal
really
presents
nothing
more
than
a
difference
of
views
as
between
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
district
court
on
the
other.
obviously
we
concur
in
the
district
court's
views
as
to
the
weight
of
evidence.
in
that
connection,
mr.
justice
white
i
asked
about
of
the
opinion
dealt
--
with
decisions
made
by
the
parties,
i
hope
your
honors
will
have
in
mind
that
there
were
two
full
and
complete
and
detailed
opinions
written
there.
and
that
both
of
those
opinions
must
be
looked
at
to
exact
--
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
painstaking
care
that
the
district
court
gave
to
all
of
the
evidence,
not
just
the
part
of
the
evidence
but
to
all
of
the
evidence.
and
in
an
effort
to
inject
into
this
factual
weight
of
evidence
question,
some
notion
of
a
legal
question
or
a
law
question,
the
appellant
asked
this
court
now
to
adopt
some
new
rule
which
would
describe
decisive
weight
to
what
the
appellant
terms
objective
evidence
and
which
would
accord
little
or
no
link
to
what
the
appellant
describes
in
the
subjective
evidence.
that
is
described
from
time
to
time
as
a
legal
question
or
a
question
of
law
in
the
appellants
brief
whether
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
10
there
it
ultimately,
whether
inadvertent
or
not,
the
concession
that
the
question
really
is
one
of
the
relative
weight
of
evidence.
on
this
objective
--
subjective
determination
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
we
referred
to
what
we
regard
as
the
inadequacies
of
appellant's
definition,
the
so-called
rule
to
the
inconsistencies
and
its
application
depending
upon
whether
the
evidence
to
be
looked
at
is
favorable
or
unfavorable
to
the
government.
we
don't
propose
to
argue
semantics
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
that
--
its
in
weight
of
evidence
between
on
the
one
hand,
hypothetical
testimony
by
a
corporate
executive
at
the
trial
as
to
what
he
would've
done
if
penn-olin
had
not
been
formed.
and
on
the
other
hand
evidence
where
the
testimonial
or
document
relating
to
the
contemporaneous
acts,
decisions,
and
the
thinking
of
the
persons
who
were
responsible
for
making
the
decision
to
enter
if
any
such
decision
was
to
be
made.
we
do
not
contend
and
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
there
is
any
requirement
imposed
upon
appellant
to
sustain
its
verdict
to
establish
a
direct
evidence,
and
intent
to
enter
or
decision
to
enter
is
simply
was
not
the
holding
of
this
court.
we
do
say
that
in
looking
at
that
question
deciding
what
the
probability
is,
it
would
be
irrational
to
exclude
consideration
of
what
was
actually
done,
the
actual
decisions
were
reached
by
the
people
who
are
going
to
make
that
decision.
i
point
out
also
that
on
the
record
on
remand,
the
defendants
did
introduce
substantial
additional
evidence
on
external
facts
as
well
as
additional
evidence
on
the
internal
consideration.
i
think
it's
important
in,
your
honors
looking
at
this
situation
to
get
a
little
perspective
on
the
market
that
has
been
talked
about
so
knowingly.
in
1960,
the
entire
demand
in
the
southeast
market
amounted
to
only
47,000
tons
of
sodium
chlorate
with
a
market
price
of
less
than
$8
million.
and
during
the
five
years
or
four
years,
that
--
five
years
that
elapsed
between
the
first
--
the
joint
venture
and
the
time
of
the
second
trial,
the
increase
had
been
less
than
twice
in
that
amount.
those
--
that
dollar
figure
can
appropriately
be
compared
with
the
multimillion
dollar
industries
that
your
honors
had
considered
on
other
cases.
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
rapidly
growing
industry
in
that
southeastern
market
and
that
it
had
growing
at
some
10%
or
12%
year
on
the
average.
but
the
basis
for
that
growth
clearly
brought
out
on
the
remand
trial
was
that
conversion
of
the
pulp
and
paper
manufacturers
in
the
southeast
to
the
chlorine
dioxide
method
of
bleaching
is
introduced
into
the
market,
new
customers
for
the
product.
there
came
a
time
however
when
that
opportunity
of
going
in
that
direction
was
exhausted
and
the
testimony
of
the
second
trial
is
that
by
1964
that
had
been
rather
substantially
completed
but
from
there
on
in
that
rate
of
growth
would
be
alive
and
the
rate
of
growth
in
the
pulp
and
paper
industry
itself.
there
was
no
longer
that
opportunity
to
add
new
pulp
and
paper
management
in
custody.
and
by
1965,
the
rate
had
in
fact
slowed
down
to
about
5%
or
6%
a
year.
and
looking
at
that
market
from
the
standpoint
of
demand,
there
was
then
in
the
market
hooker
and
american
potash
company
which
then
had,
going
back
to
1960,
productive
capacities
sufficient
to
supply
the
entire
market.
as
the
court
below
noted,
they
were
multimillion
dollar
companies,
they
had
adequate
resources
to
expand
their
facilities
to
meet
any
anticipatory
demand
that
might
be
created
in
the
market.
now,
against
that
background,
the
cost
of
putting
a
plant
in,
in
the
southeast,
was
not
high
in
any
absolute
sense.
testimony
is
that
a
15,000-ton
plant
would
have
cost
about
$4
million,
25,000-ton
plant
about
$7
million.
but
in
relation
to
the
size
of
the
market
that
was
a
high
price
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
entering
the
market
in
trying
to
take
the
small
share
away
from
hooker
and
american
potash.
to
make
those
that
definition
of
the
market
is
important
in
considering
what
kind
of
consideration
was
given
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
pennsalt
and
olin.
each
of
them
had
considered
the
possibility
of
an
entry
for
years.
then,
at
least
the
ninth
--
middle
1950's,
pennsalt
gave
serious
consideration
to
it,
conducted
a
number
of
studies,
and
the
highest
projection
that
it
could
make
as
to
possible
return
on
investment
was
something
in
the
order
of
16%,
3.9
to
be
precise.
pennsalt
figured
its
estimate
returns
on
the
basis
of
before
taxes,
and
olin
after
taxes
so
there
was
some
confusion,
though,
they'll
have
that
in
mind.
it
was
at
that
point
in
1957,
that
the
pennsalt
management
determined
that
independent
entry
was
not
a
possibility
to
them.
the
investment
policy
of
pennsalt
had
been
--
for
some
time
had
been,
that
in
this
kind
of
venture.
that
they
had
to
have
a
projective
return
of
at
least
25%
before
taxes
to
make
the
investment
at
all
attractive
and
that's
it.
the
existence
of
that
investment
policy
was
brought
out
on
the
--
the
first
trial,
also
at
the
second
trial,
still
continued
in
producing
useful
results.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
second
trial
took
two
weeks.
now
there
was
consideration
given
by
pennsalt
in
1958
and
1959
that
the
possibility
of
a
sodium
chlorate
plant,
not
on
it's
own,
but
in
combination
with
ammonium
perchlorate,
just
a
the
word
about
that
perchlorate
because
it
really
goes
out
of
the
picture
entirely
very
shortly.
it
did
have
1957-1958
real
promise
as
a
possible
growth
product.
used
as
a
rocket
propellant
and
there
was
estimates
made
that
the
demand
would
increase
by
40%
in
1959
and
by
a
140%
perhaps
in
1961.
and
early
in
1958,
pennsalt
did
in
fact
put
up
a
small
pilot
plant
of
its
west
coast
portland
plant.
and
that
plant
was
expanded
with
commercial
production
in
about
2000
tons
in
february
of
1959.
they
did
consider,
november
of
1958
in
carrying
on
to
the
early
part
of
1959
the
possibility
of
putting
a
combination
of
those
two
together
in
the
southeast,
but
increasing
doubts
as
to
the
demand
for
ammonium
perchlorate
led
to
the
conclusion,
led
to
the
loss
of
interest
in
it
in
early
1959.
in
august
of
1960,
the
defense
department
advised
that
there
was
then
a
substantial
excess
of
capacity
of
perchlorate
and
would
continue
at
least
for
the
next
two
or
three
years.
footnote
on
that,
perchlorate
story,
by
1964
the
market
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
pennsalt
closed
its
west
coast
plant.
the
appellant
asked
us
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
pennsalt
went
into
the
joint
venture
at
all.
and
had
it
got
been
for
the
joint
venture,
it
could
be
counted
on
to
go
in
by
itself.
that
argument
ignores
the
essential
difference
that
exists
between
the
joint
venture
and
independent
entry.
penn-olin
estimates
called
for
a
plant
finally
at
26,500
tons
and
cost
to
$7.5
million
of
which
4.5
was
to
borrowed
by
penn-olin
requiring
an
equity
investment
of
only
$1.5
million
by
each
of
the
parents.
this
meant
that
the
joint
venture
offered
a
--
the
economics
of
a
larger
plant
that
either
would
have
considered
on
its
own.
it
offered
the
opportunity
of
combining
pennsalt's
production
experience
with
olin's
sales
experience
in
the
southeast,
thereby
providing
a
greater
opportunity
for
competition
with
american
potash
and
hooker.
it
provided
by
this
borrowing
device
that
the
penn-olin
had
a
50%
subsidiary,
the
borrowings
of
penn-olin
would
not
show
up
on
the
balance
sheet
and
therefore
not
affect
the
debt
ratios
either
of
pennsalt
or
olin.
this
meant
a
substantially
higher
return
on
the
equity.
pennsalt
estimate
was
that
for
the
penn-olin
plan,
a
return
on
the
total
investment
would
be
some
11.8%
before
taxes,
but
for
pennsalt
its
investment
amounted
to
31%,
and
that
was
the
one
way
that
the
joint
venture
provided
the
only
way
for
pennsalt
could
achieve
an
attractive
enough
return
to
meet
its
minimum
standards.
olin
likewise
gave
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
independent
entry
beginning
in
the
middle
of
1950's.
in
1958
and
1959,
it
entered
into
a
test
marketing
project
with
pennsalt
whereby
olin
sold
in
this
market,
in
the
southeast
market,
to
see
what
the
possibilities
were
for
getting
into
it.
in
april
of
1959,
the
first
and
only
recommendation
was
made
by
olin's
chemical
division
which
was
to
put
up
a
15,000-ton
plant,
the
cost
of
$4
million
with
a
projected
after
tax
return
of
11%.
that
proposal
was
rejected
by
the
olin
management.
that
was
a
managerial
position
at
that
time.
it
is
true
that
subsequently,
talks
of
the
joint
venture
late
in
1959
led
to
a
consideration,
a
conclusion,
go
in
to
the
joint
venture
in
1960.
the
argument
that
the
appellant
makes
that
we'll
perhaps
there
had
been
a
different
decision.
there
had
not
been
talks
of
the
joint
venture.
if
by
that,
the
appellant
means
that
we
take
the
position
that
olin's
rejection
of
the
proposal
is
conclusive
could
simply
eliminates
the
possibility
that
olin
would
have
any
interest
at
anytime
in
going
in,
of
course
we
agree
with
it.
but
i
take
that
the
burden
on
it
is
not
upon
us
to
establish
the
impossibility
of
all
endeavor
going
in
independently
but
rather
the
burden
is
on
the
government
who
established
a
probability
that
one
or
the
other
would
have
gone
in.
and
on
that
issue,
the
issue
of
probability,
i
ask
your
honors
to
think
on
--
and
look
only
two
things.
first,
after
this
letter
of
intent,
february
of
1960
that
they
entered
into,
olin
reconsidered
even
the
desirability
of
going
into
the
much
more
attractive
joint
venture.
and
it
wasn't
finally
approved
until
august
1960
after
there
had
been
significant
changes
made,
the
capacity
--
the
rated
capacity
of
the
plant
had
been
increased.
after
then
redesigned
to
bring
about
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
cost
and
there
was
a
further
redesign
in
engineering
to
produce
an
improvement
in
the
estimated
rate
of
return.
if,
as
you
consider,
the
potential
to
what
olin
was
considering
about
the
more
attractive
joint
venture,
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
with
those
circumstances
existing
that
olin
would
nevertheless
had
went
ahead
independent.
now,
we
point
also
to
evidence
concerning
other
large
number
of
other
potential
merchant
producers
of
sodium
chlorate
who
were
giving
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
entry
in
the
same
market.
but
this
evidence
on
the
other
potential
merchant
producers
has
a
dual
relevance.
it
bears
upon
the
question
of
the
lessening
of
competition
issue
because
it
bears
upon
the
impact
if
any
of
that
potential
commission
--
competition
had
upon
the
market.
but
it's
also
bears
upon
my
issue
of
probability
because
here
are
companies
that
had
exactly
the
same
capacity
that
is
described
to
pennsalt
and
olin,
and
that
be
the
same
interest
in
terms
of
sustained
consideration,
and
yet
they
did
not
in
fact
reached
the
decision
to
enter
the
market
independently.
to
mention
just
a
few
here,
allied
chemical
which
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeastern
market
which
was
indeed
actually
engaged
in
the
sale
of
sodium
chlorate
in
that
market,
as
sales
agent
for
american
potash
and
its
predecessor
from
1950
right
through
1965.
it
gave
periodic
consideration
and
studied
the
possibility
of
putting
up
a
plant
on
its
own.it

reached
the
point
of
finding
it
attractive
(inaudible).

or

machinery
corporation,
it
also
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast,
engaged
in
the
sale
of
chemicals
to
the
pulp
and
paper
industry,
it
conducted
chlorate
studies,

or
at
least
by
two-year

throughout

to

alkali,
it
had
a
chlorine
plant
in
the

it
conducted

it
made
sales
to
the
pulp
and
paper
industry.
it
conducted
studies,
intensive
studies
in
1958
and
1959
which
led
to
a
formal
recommendation
by
staff,
the
management,
of
entry
into
the
market,
and
that
recommendation
was
rejected.
wyandotte
is
another.
it
also
had
the
same
situation
with
reference
to
a
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast,
sales
of
chemicals
to
pulp
and
paper
companies,
studies
in
1952
and
1953,
again,
in
1959,
and
no
decisions
to
going
up.
each
of
those
companies
as
well
as
others
that
will
be
mentioned
on
this
(inaudible)
--
each
of
those
companies
had
the
capacity
to
enter
the
field,
each
of
the
companies
considered
it.
they
had
an
active
interest.
on
appellant's
theory,
all
of
those
were
not
merely
potential,
but
were
probable
entrants
and
yet
throughout
all
of
those
years
none
of
them
in
fact
have
entered.
the
only
company
that
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes
sir?
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
think
as
mr.
delone
will
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
it
could
well
be
sir,
in
terms
of
certain
industry,
but
not
in
this
industry
because
the
testimony
is
quite
clear.
that
the
only
price
effect
of
potential
competition
came
not
from
the
existence
of
this
large
number
of
possible
entrants
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
--
the
pulp
and
paper
companies
start
--
of
starting
production
on
their
own.
again,
that's
a
subject
to
be
developed
in
(inaudible)
next
by
mr.
delone.
now,
the
only
company
did
in
fact
was
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
1961,
that
significant
is
the
only
company
in
this
large
group
i
have
referred
to
which
combined
manufacturing
experience
in
sodium
chlorate,
had
a
plant
in
canada,
and
selling
experience
in
the
southeast
from
its
chlorine
plant
in
the
southeast.
that's
a
combination,
the
pennsalt
and
olin
were
able
to
achieve
only
by
the
joint
venture.
during
this
entire
period
of
time,
during
the
1950's
and
up
to
august
of
1960,
although
each
of
these
companies
gave
consideration
to
possibility
of
entry,
neither
company
was
able
to
justify
entry.
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
market
was
expanding
rapidly,
at
that
time
there
were
only
two
producers
in
the
market,
at
that
time
the
price
levels
appeared
to
be
burdened.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
period
of
time
after
august
1960,
the
sooner
or
later
period
during
which
the
appellant
says
that
it
is
probably
that
either
one
or
the
other
that
it
--
they
find
not
only
in
the
increase
in
the
probability,
they
find
that
the
market
becomes
less
and
less
attractive,
first,
with
the
entry
of
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
1961.
that
made
a
--
in
a
small
market
three
producers
rather
than
the
two
that
existed
formally.
secondly,
a
thread
of
captive
production
by
the
pulp
and
paper
companies,
again,
in
the
early
60's,
a
development
which
you
had
--
if
it
had
fully
materialized
would
reduce
the
demand
by
some
55%
and
finally,
in
1964
an
actual
price
reduction
of
approximately
9%.
all
the
market
facts
since
1960
in
our
view
make
even
more
able
to
do
the
possibility
of
independent
entry
by
either
company
had
the
joint
venture
not
on
olin,
and
in
our
submission,
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
this
issue
is
clearly
correct.
