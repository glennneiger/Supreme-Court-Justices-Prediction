let
me
see
if
i
get
this,
suppose
that
--
supposed
what
we
have
here
was,
that
olin
should
never
had
any
idea
of
the
joint,
or
never
suggested
it.
olin
went
through
everything
that
it
did
and
finally
the
board
of
directors
after
waiting
considerations
said,
“no,
we
better
stay
out
of
this
on
our
own”.
pennsalt,
done
so
--
everything
it
did,
and
now
24%
is
our
policy
and
this
promises
us
in
that
,
and
we're
not
going
into
it.
these
decisions
are
made.
so
a
month
later,
this
happens,
(inaudible)
meeting
between
the
two
executives
comes
about
then
has
generated
all
of
the
events
which
finally
resulted
in
a
joint
venture,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
real
point
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
real
point
is
that
in
the
context
of
the
joint
venture
are
very
much
in
the
mind
of
both
companies
and
of
both
management,
top
management,
when
all
these
other
events
are
going
give
a
flavor
in
this
which
is
rather
different

in
other
words,
all
you're
asking
us
if
you
prevail,
if
you
send
it
back
for
the
--
pre-dissolving
joint
ventures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
you
want
us
to
say
you've
established
the
case
with
a
section
7
violation,
nothing
remains
to
be
done
now
except
an
appropriate
decree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
brief,
but
i
thought
--
all
you
ask
is
the
reversal
and
the
remand
for
the
fashion
whether
an
appropriate
decree
beyond
anything
else?
