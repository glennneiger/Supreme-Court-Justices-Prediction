justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
really
asking
us
to
arrive
at
a
result
that
involves
modification
or
prior
decision
in
this
court
in
this
case,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
(inaudible)
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
connelly
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
in
the
argument
that
the
existence
of
those
companies
hence
--
may
have
had
some
market
effect.
that
is
to
say
that
the
existence
of
those
companies
and
the
possibility
or
whatever,
that
the
word,
(inaudible)
of
entry
into
the
market
may
have
had
some
effect
on
the
price
in
the
market,
that's
a
--
an
observation
going
from
other
fields,
but
i
suppose
it
applies
here
too.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
a
difference
between
a
potential
--
a
--
between
the
market
effect,
these
companies
have
had
a
sort
of
(inaudible),
let's
say
of
having
been
that
--
the
number
of
their
operations.
the
possibility
of
expansion
into
this
field,
the
difference
between
a
joint
venture
by
companies
of
that
sort
for
example
and
companies
engaged
in
totally
unrelated
fields
that
don't
have
within
this
same
figure
of
speech,
that
don't
have
between
the
--
numbers
in
their
operations
within
that
field?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
all
of
them
got
together?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
supposed
all
of
the
companies
in
the
chlor-alkali
group
got
together
and
formed
a
joint
enterprise,
what
would
your
position
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
all
probability
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
impact
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
antitrust
consequences?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
really
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
put
your
--
is
that
your
position,
somewhat
diluted
and
i
think
because
if
i
follow
you
then,
what
you're
saying
is
that
penn
--
as
that
penn
and
olin
put
together,
did
not
constitute
a
sufficiently
large
segment
of
the
group
of
potential
competitors
to
have
a
necessary
antitrust
impact.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
only
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
other
aspect
of
it
from
your
point
of
view
now,
i
should
think
is
that
when
you
have
--
when
you
have
this
--
you
have
the
facts
upon
which
we
were
working,
the
problem
upon
which
we
were
working
assumes
that
there
is
another
company
that
is
in
this
business
that
wasn't
in
the
business
before.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
presumably
is
providing
the
competition
of
an
actual
competitor
so
that
you
have
not
only
a
process
of
subtraction
but
you
also
have
a
process
of
addition
if
there
are
--
that
a
balance
i
suppose.
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
think
that
those
in
fact,
whether
it
inspired
essential
profound
disbelief
in
the
honor
of
heir
intention.
