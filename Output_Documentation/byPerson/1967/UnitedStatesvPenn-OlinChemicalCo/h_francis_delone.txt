mr.
h.
francis
delone
may
it
please
the
court.
my
position
here
is
a
bit
odd
because
if
this
deal
is
right,
its
basic
finding
as
i
trust
mr.
connelly
have
persuaded
you,
and
the
subject
to
which
i
turn
my
attention
is
one
which
--
will
in
no
event
reached
by
the
court.
in
other
words,
if
in
fact,
as
defendants
have
intended,
the
finding
the
court
below
has
not
shown
that
there's
reason
to
be
probable,
that
either
pennsalt
or
olin
could
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture.
if
that
finding
sustained
that,
of
course,
is
an
end
to
this
mitigation,
which
the
government
has
described,
i
guess
fairly
as
attractive
mitigation.
but
we
must
be
concerned
about
the
second
suggestion
which
the
government
makes
here.
it
suggests
that
you
should
overturn
judge
steele's
fact
finding
or
finding
that
there
was
no
showing
of
a
probability
of
entry
by
pennsalt
or
olin.
and
that
you
should
go
beyond
that.
and
that
on
the
record
which
is
now
before
you,
you
should
find
first
that
it
was
probable
that
one
of
these
companies
at
least
would
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
the
joint
venture.
and
second,
it
should
find
that
had
that
one
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
the
joint
venture,
that
would
have
been
more
competitive
if
you
will
than
the
entry
that
was
made
by
penn-olin.
in
other
words,
they
contend
that
the
section
7
lessening
of
competition
here
means
that
the
increase
of
competition
provided
by
penn-olin
which
did
bring
a
new
competitive
force
in
the
market
as
this
court
earlier
have
viewed,
they
contend
that
any
--
that
increase
was
less
than
the
increase
which
hypothetically
would
have
resulted
from
separate
entry
by
one
of
these
companies
and
the
other
company
remaining
pondering
as
i
think
mr.
zimmerman
referred
to
it,
or
in
the
wings
as
referred
to
at
the
time
of
our
last
argument.
and
this
second
contention
which
the
government
puts
in
it's
brief
this
way,
it
remains
only
to
consider
whether
the
relevant
market
was
highly
concentrated
and
whether
the
potential
competition
of
the
firm
that
might
not
have
entered
immediately
represented
a
sufficiently
important
restraint
on
the
behavior
of
the
existing
sellers
in
the
market,
that
is
removal,
brings
the
joint
venture
within
the
band
of
the
statute.
now,
after
the
first
trial,
when
we
really
dealt
with
the
question
and
the
contention
that
both
companies
was
at
--
would've
entered
or
with
the
contention
that
that
if
they
had
the
capability
to
enter,
they
were
not
free
to
engage
in
the
joint
venture.
the
government
moved
in
this
court
to
the
theory
which
this
court
sustained
at
the
last
argument
we
had
here
which
was
the
district
court
should
give
consideration
to
the
question
if
one
had
entered,
then
would
the
other
been
--
have
been,
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture
what
was
referred
to
as
a
significant
potential
competitor.
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
most
of
the
testimony
at
the
second
trial
was
particularly
addressed,
the
trial
on
remand.
there
was
a
two-week
trial
and
the
appellees,
the
defendants
called
some
19
witnesses
under
subpoena
who
were
drawn
from
the
actual
competitors
in
the
marketplace
from
the
other
chemical
companies
who
had
been
considering
the
possibility
of
entering
the
market
and
from
the
pulp
and
paper
company
customers
who
likewise
had
been
considering
entering
the
market.
the
court
below
has
never
come
to
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
of
whether
under
the
facts
that
were
then
adduced,
there
would
be
a
substantial
“lessening”
in
the
sense
that
i
have
explained
because
it's
found
the
--
there
was
no
probability
of
entry
by
one
company
or
the
other,
and
that
disposes
the
case
if
that's
as
far
as
you
go.
the
government
says
now
that
on
this
second
question,
your
honors
should
first
reverse
what
judge
steele's
has
already
decided
and
then
should
decide
the
other
even
though
the
district
court
has
never
really
come
to
grips
with
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
to
the
trial
on
remand.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
at
the
trial
on
the
remand,
the
government
adduced
no
testimony
on
any
of
the
three
issues
which
had
been
declared
to
be
the
issues
there
to
be
tried.
now,
this
issue
that
i'm
talking
about
is
quite
different
from
the
question
of
the
probability
of
entry
that
mr.
connelly
has
addressed
himself
to.
there,
the
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact
finding,
was
it
probable
that
one
company
would
have
entered
the
market,
one
or
the
other?
here,
the
question
is
assuming
that
one
would've,
what
would've
been
the
effect
on
competition
of
having
another
company
still
in
the
wings
that
might
enter
the
market
at
some
later
time?
mr.
zimmerman
phrase
it
whose
presence
on
the
edge
might
influence
decision
of
those
in
the
market.
so
that
--
it's
really
a
question
of
how
will
the
actual
competitors
be
influenced
by
the
presence
of
a
company,
one
company
in
the
wings
that
they
recognized
as
a
company
which
might
enter
the
market?
the
government
seems
to
recognize
this
in
it's
brief,
and
yet
in
the
passage
i
read
to
you
few
moments
ago,
and
yet
when
it
turns
to
deal
with
this
second
question
which
we
say
is
not
properly
presented
here
because
it
has
not
yet
been
considered
below,
when
it
turns
to
that
question,
it
ignores
entirely
the
testimony
of
the
actual
competitors
in
the
marketplace,
testimony
which
was
adduced
by
the
defendants
in
the
court
below.
it
quarrels
with
whether
a
particular
company
should
be
classed
as
a
serious
potential
entrant
or
not
on
the
basis
only
of
that
company's
internal
considerations
of
whether
or
not
it
would
enter.
and
on
that
basis
it
concedes
four
significant,
what
it
calls
potent
--
serious
potential
entrants,
pennsalt,
olin,
ppg
and
allied.
and
then
it
discusses
the
testimony,
some
of
which
mr.
connelly
has
already
adverted
to,
with
reference
to
diamond,
dow
--
alright
diamond,
wyandotte,
fmc,
kaiser
or
other
companies
in
the
chlorate-like
group
and
reasons
--
for
one
reason
or
another
that
wasn't
really
probable
that
in
fact
those
particular
companies
would
enter
the
market.
but
it
seems
to
--
and
then
it
goes
on
and
does
essentially
the
same
thing
about
the
pulp
and
paper
companies
who
later
came
to
a
consideration
of
the
same
question
of
whether
or
not
they
would
enter
the
market.
now,
your
honors
will
see
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
unfortunately
was
designated
for
putting
in
the
record
and
somehow
it
was
lost
and
shuffled.
this
exhibit
that
mr.
zimmerman
has
already
referred
to
appears
at
page
3a
of
our
brief
and
it
lists
there
all
of
the
substantial
chlor-alkali
companies
as
they
are
called,
plus
two
others
that
are
not
generally
in
the
chlor-alkali
group
which
are
chapman
chemical
company
and
virginia
chemicals.
and
then
at
page
--
it
list
them
both
in
terms
of
--
these
stipulated
facts,
terms
of
their
assets,
the
next
page,
their
land
and
equipment,
the
next
page,
their
sales,
the
next
page,
their
net
income.
and
then
we
go
through
a
similar
setting
for
--
to
the
fact
with
reference
to
the
southeastern
pulp
and
paper
companies
who
as
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
at
the
trial
on
remand
shows
were
also
considering
entry.
now
it's
perfectly
clear
turning
first
to
the
chemical
companies
the
actuality
which
is
what
the
government
--
oh,
the
likelihood
of
their
entry
what
--
which
the
government,
i
think,
mistakenly
thought
this
was
on
that
indeed
there
were
eight
or
nine
of
such
companies
which
gave
repeated,
steady
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
breaking
in
to
the
southeastern
market.
a
company
set
as
dow
chemical
which
made
--
which
had
done
research
on
it
for
years,
which
approached
the
southern
pulp
mills
in
late
1959
to
try
to
solicit
it's
method
of
delivering
chlorine
dioxide
by
putting
up
a
plant
next
door
to
the
pulp
mill
and
making
it's
own
sodium
chlorate
in
the
dow
plant
and
delivering
the
finished
product
which
is
what
the
pulp
now
really
wants,
direct
to
the
pulp
mill.
and
i
don't
think
however
that
i
should
spend
much
time
talking
more
about
the
actuality
because
in
our
contention
this
is
not
what
really
counts.
and
i
really
do
want
to
point
out
the
record
is
entirely
clear,
there
were
no
barriers
to
entry
by
any
of
the
pulp
and
paper
companies.
indeed,
it's
conceded
in
the
very
footnote
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
mr.
zimmerman
has
cited
here
and
that
it
has
not
been
contested.
it
was
also
included
in
the
some
of
the
government's
findings
of
facts.
so
no
barriers
to
entry
and
this
were
known
in
the
industry.
and
likewise
beginning
at
least
in
the
early
60's
it
became
feasible
for
the
pulp
mills
to
build
their
own
plant
because
they
could
--
in
their
own
mills,
could
take
sodium
chlorate
in
liquid
form
and
deliver
it
into
the
bleaching
part
of
their
plant,
and
thereby
avoid
paying
great
quantities
of
freight,
to
ship
it
in
the
liquid
form.
they
were
able
to
use
it
in
that
form
and
the
testimony
is
that
an
economically
feasible
operation
for
them.
as
long
as
they
manufacture
it
right
where
they
wanted
to
use
it
was
down
to
something
under
5,000
tons
per
year.
so
that
has
been
the
situation
which
has
come
to
develop.
but
what's
really
important
to
--
in
our
contention
on
the
second
issue
is
what
did
the
actual
competitors
think
about
potential
competition?
how
did
potential
competition
influence
the
market
behavior
of
the
actual
competitors
because
that's
what
we're
talking
about
if
we
assume
that
one
company
would
have
entered
and
the
others
significance
or
influence
is
only
in
respect
of
how
it
went
--
might
work
on
the
actual
operations
in
the
marketplace.
now,
we
called
on
this
subject
the
responsible
officials
of
the
hooker
chemical
company,
the
--
one
of
the
two
original
market
occupants
of
the
american
potash
company,
and
finally,
of
pittsburgh
plate
glass
which
entered
in
1961.
so
these
are
the
three
actual
competitors
of
the
marketplace.
and
mr.
(inaudible)
made
it
clear
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
potential
competition
from
the
chemical
companies
was
as
he
put
it
most
of
the
chlor-alkali
industry,
that's
the
group
that's
listed
in
the
appendix
to
which
i
have
already
referred.
mr.
neubauer
referred
to
the
chlor-alkali
group
and
mr.
dirksen
referred
to
the
chlor-alkali
manufacturers
as
a
class.
he
actually
used
the
word
as
a
class.
mr.
dirksen
said
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned,
foremost
in
the
group
was
allied.
he
said
that
pennsalt
and
olin,
he
regarded,
as
lately
entrants
but
viewed
the
whole
class
as
the
potential
competition
so
far
as
merchant
producers
were
concerned.
and
potential
competitors
such
as
dow,
mr.
(inaudible),
and
barn
of
allied,
both
recognized
that
the
potential
competition
--
and
this
goes
back
to
1960.
the
questions
were
put
to
them
as
of
1960's,
“whom
did
you
recognize
as
the
potential
competition?”
and
mr.
(inaudible)
and
mr.
barn
also
corroborated,
the
chlor-alkali
industry
as
a
group,
that's
that
large
group
of
well-financed
companies
that
i've
already
mentioned.
now,
turning
to
mr.
justice
fortas's
question,
what
was
the
influence
on
the
--
those
in
the
marketplace
and
if
you
would
look
at
the
testimony
of
mr.
cowey,
the
official
of
hooker
at
record
177,
he
makes
clear
that
yes,
the
actual
competitors
of
the
marketplace
took
into
account
the
possibility
that
anyone
of
this
group
of
chlor-alkali
producers
might
enter
the
market
and
that
tended
to
hold
the
pricing
down.
there
was
no
actual
price
change
until
1964
when
there
was
reduction
because
of
the
threat
of
captive
production
by
this
pulp
and
paper
company.
but
he
said
that,
yes,
the
presence
of
these
large
number
of
well-financed
chemical
companies,
that
i'm
--
is
not
his
terms,
i'm
not
quoting
precisely,
that
that
influence
intended
to
keep
a
break
on
the
price.
but
he
said
equally
that
that
would
have
been
unaffected
by
whether
or
not
pennsalt
or
olin
were
included
in
or
excluded
out
of
the
group
of
chlor-alkali
companies.
one
company
more
or
less
made
no
difference
and
in
fact
mr.
dirksen
testified
that
his
business
decisions
and
reactions,
this
is
an
actual
contender.
his
business
decisions
and
reactions
would
not
have
been
influenced
by
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
of
allied
chemical
in
the
group
that
he
regarded
as
the
likely
potentials
as
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
even
though
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
even
though
mr.
dirksen
regarded
allied
as
the
foremost
potential
competitor.
he
said,
you
can
put
it
in
the
group
or
take
it
out.
it
would
make
no
difference
to
him.
now,
i
didn't
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
if
you
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
--
were
not
for
the
pulp
and
paper
companies,
you
would
clearly
then
have
an
elimination
of
all
potential
competition
and
at
least
the
potential
competition
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
which
i'm
dealing
with
and
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
not
precisely
sir.
maybe
i
can
clarify
and
it's
the
problem
were
dealing
with
the
hypothetical
situation
here.
we're
dealing
with
a
question
assumed
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
and
in
fact
in
the
absence
of
this
joint
venture
that
one
would
have
entered,
the
manufacturer
out
in
the
southeast.
then
what
influence
would
the
other
who
by
hypothesis
didn't
enter
but
was
merely
pondering
and
indeed
wouldn't
have
entered
according
to
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
was
referred,
how
much
difference
does
it
make
to
preserve
that
company,
that
other
company
in
the
wings
because
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
if
the
two
companies
go
into
the
joint
venture,
then
it
means
they're
eliminated
as
separate.
they
can't
--
can
no
longer
be
looked
on
as
potential
competitors
but
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that's
correct.
and
that's
why,
as
we
have
said,
the
lessening
is
a
curious
kind
of
a
lessening.
the
lessening
really
is,
did
you
increase
competition
less
than
might
have
been
--
that
it
might
have
been
increased
under
the
hypothetical
situation
that
i've
been
talking
about.
and
we
had
the
testimony
of
professor
cooke
from
harvard
business
school,
an
economist,
who
turned
his
attention
to
the
same
subject
and
the
government
has
ignored
this
as
it's
ignored
the
actual
reactions
of
those
in
the
marketplace
and
it
seems
to
me
he
pretty
well
summed
it
up.
he
was
asked
by
and
--
by
the
court,
page
434,
“how
important
then
in
determining
a
threshold
price
would
it
be
if
one
of
these
persons
in
the
chlori
--
chlor-alkali
group
put
in
the
papers,
“we
have
no
intention
now
or
a
forever
of
going
into
the
sodium
chlorate
business
in
the
southeast?”
how
would
that
affect
the
threshold
price
and
the
answer
was
the
removal
of
one
would
make
no
difference
at
all.
the
general
threat
--
generalized
threat
of
entry
would
stay
as
strong
as
it
was
before.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
he
turned
to
a
bit
more
of
something
that's
practically
what
the
government
asserts
in
its
brief
for
the
benefit
of
the
testimony
when
he
was
asked
on
the
assumption
be
it
--
record
identifies
10
potential
merchant
producers
of
sodium
chlorate
in
the
southeast.
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
hypothesize
the
decisive
removal,
without
an
announcement
sir,
of
five
of
these
companies
as
potential
competitors,
would
the
further
removal
of
one
of
the
remaining
five
potential
competitors
have
an
effect
on
the
action
of
those
in
the
market
at
page
436.
answer,
“i
would
expect
those
in
the
market
to
react
to
four
outside
as
much
as
they
would
react
to
the
eight
outside.”
and
he
said
parenthetically
--
and
indeed
to
the
extent
that
they
reacted
at
all,
because
his
testimony
was
quite
clear
that
the
actual
competition
brought
on
by
penn-olin,
brought
on
by
ppg's
later
entry
was
more
significant
indeed
than
the
potential
competition.
and
the
testimony
of
those
in
the
marketplace
was
equally
clear
that
from
their
standpoint,
i
refer
again
to
the
officials
of
the
american
potash
and
of
hooker
and
ppg,
that
the
most
significant
potential
competition
to
them
was
that
threatened
by
the
large
group
of
pulp
and
paper
companies.
these
were
the
ultimate
consumers
and
if
they
embarked
on
the
production
of
this
product,
it
meant
that
the
commercial
producers
such
as
hooker,
american
potash,
or
later
penn-olin
was
permanently
deprived
of
a
portion
of
the
market.
and
responsive
to
the
possibility
of
captive
production,
it
was
in
1964,
that
the
price
of
this
product
in
the
southeastern
market
was
reduced.
now,
it
seems
to
us
from
this
testimony
which
i
have
briefly
summarized
on
the
second
trial
that
although
we
do
not
contend
that
this
court
should
try
to
sift
the
testimony
of
19
or
20
witnesses
adduced
at
that
trial
without
having
the
benefit
of
the
trial
judges'
comments
on
it
and
findings
on
it.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
if
there
were
to
be
any
ruling
by
this
court
on
this
record,
on
the
ultimate
issue
whether
competition
was
lessened
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
increased
as
much
by
penn-olin
as
it
might
have
been
increased
if
one
of
the
penn-olin
parents
had
entered
and
if
the
other
had
remained
interested.
even
though,
we
don't
contend
that
if
you
look
at
this
record
no
fair
reading
of
the
record
could
lead
this
court
to
conclude
other
than
that
in
fact
there
was
no
showing
of
the
lessening
of
competition
in
the
sense
that
i've
referred
to
by
the
government
and
the
record
indeed
is
just
to
the
contrary.
the
cases
that
have
been
relied
on
at
the
el
paso
case,
the
clorox
case,
the
continental
can
case,
are
quite
different
situations
although
there
was
an
element
of
potential
competition
in
those
cases.
el
paso
involved
a
company
that
was
actually
bidding
for
the
business
in
the
marketplace
and
only
one
company
which
merged
with
an
actual
competitor.
clorox
involved
the
single
substantial
potential
competitor,
the
procter
&
gamble
company,
which
the
trade
commissioner
found
and
this
court
agree
was
really
the
only
likely
entrant,
and
the
combination
between
those
two.
and
continental
can
involved
a
situation
where
there
were
--
was
both
actual
and
potential
competition
by
virtue
of
the
definition
of
the
market
between
the
two
companies
that
were
involved
in
that
transaction,
so
none
of
them
presents
a
situation
such
as
is
presented
in
this
case.
in
our
contention,
the
district
court's
finding
was
correct
neither
pennsalt
nor
olin
would,
as
a
reasonable
probability,
have
entered
the
market.
but
even
if
that
finding
were
not
correct
in
our
contention,
there
was
no
lessening
of
competition
by
the
elimination
of
the
other
joint
venture
parent
from
the
ranks
of
potential
competitors
of
whom
there
were
a
great
number
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
may
it
please
the
court.
my
position
here
is
a
bit
odd
because
if
this
deal
is
right,
its
basic
finding
as
i
trust
mr.
connelly
have
persuaded
you,
and
the
subject
to
which
i
turn
my
attention
is
one
which
--
will
in
no
event
reached
by
the
court.
in
other
words,
if
in
fact,
as
defendants
have
intended,
the
finding
the
court
below
has
not
shown
that
there's
reason
to
be
probable,
that
either
pennsalt
or
olin
could
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture.
if
that
finding
sustained
that,
of
course,
is
an
end
to
this
mitigation,
which
the
government
has
described,
i
guess
fairly
as
attractive
mitigation.
but
we
must
be
concerned
about
the
second
suggestion
which
the
government
makes
here.
it
suggests
that
you
should
overturn
judge
steele's
fact
finding
or
finding
that
there
was
no
showing
of
a
probability
of
entry
by
pennsalt
or
olin.
and
that
you
should
go
beyond
that.
and
that
on
the
record
which
is
now
before
you,
you
should
find
first
that
it
was
probable
that
one
of
these
companies
at
least
would
have
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
the
joint
venture.
and
second,
it
should
find
that
had
that
one
entered
the
market
in
the
absence
of
the
joint
venture,
that
would
have
been
more
competitive
if
you
will
than
the
entry
that
was
made
by
penn-olin.
in
other
words,
they
contend
that
the
section
7
lessening
of
competition
here
means
that
the
increase
of
competition
provided
by
penn-olin
which
did
bring
a
new
competitive
force
in
the
market
as
this
court
earlier
have
viewed,
they
contend
that
any
--
that
increase
was
less
than
the
increase
which
hypothetically
would
have
resulted
from
separate
entry
by
one
of
these
companies
and
the
other
company
remaining
pondering
as
i
think
mr.
zimmerman
referred
to
it,
or
in
the
wings
as
referred
to
at
the
time
of
our
last
argument.
and
this
second
contention
which
the
government
puts
in
it's
brief
this
way,
it
remains
only
to
consider
whether
the
relevant
market
was
highly
concentrated
and
whether
the
potential
competition
of
the
firm
that
might
not
have
entered
immediately
represented
a
sufficiently
important
restraint
on
the
behavior
of
the
existing
sellers
in
the
market,
that
is
removal,
brings
the
joint
venture
within
the
band
of
the
statute.
now,
after
the
first
trial,
when
we
really
dealt
with
the
question
and
the
contention
that
both
companies
was
at
--
would've
entered
or
with
the
contention
that
that
if
they
had
the
capability
to
enter,
they
were
not
free
to
engage
in
the
joint
venture.
the
government
moved
in
this
court
to
the
theory
which
this
court
sustained
at
the
last
argument
we
had
here
which
was
the
district
court
should
give
consideration
to
the
question
if
one
had
entered,
then
would
the
other
been
--
have
been,
in
the
absence
of
a
joint
venture
what
was
referred
to
as
a
significant
potential
competitor.
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
most
of
the
testimony
at
the
second
trial
was
particularly
addressed,
the
trial
on
remand.
there
was
a
two-week
trial
and
the
appellees,
the
defendants
called
some
19
witnesses
under
subpoena
who
were
drawn
from
the
actual
competitors
in
the
marketplace
from
the
other
chemical
companies
who
had
been
considering
the
possibility
of
entering
the
market
and
from
the
pulp
and
paper
company
customers
who
likewise
had
been
considering
entering
the
market.
the
court
below
has
never
come
to
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
of
whether
under
the
facts
that
were
then
adduced,
there
would
be
a
substantial
“lessening”
in
the
sense
that
i
have
explained
because
it's
found
the
--
there
was
no
probability
of
entry
by
one
company
or
the
other,
and
that
disposes
the
case
if
that's
as
far
as
you
go.
the
government
says
now
that
on
this
second
question,
your
honors
should
first
reverse
what
judge
steele's
has
already
decided
and
then
should
decide
the
other
even
though
the
district
court
has
never
really
come
to
grips
with
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
to
the
trial
on
remand.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
at
the
trial
on
the
remand,
the
government
adduced
no
testimony
on
any
of
the
three
issues
which
had
been
declared
to
be
the
issues
there
to
be
tried.
now,
this
issue
that
i'm
talking
about
is
quite
different
from
the
question
of
the
probability
of
entry
that
mr.
connelly
has
addressed
himself
to.
there,
the
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact
finding,
was
it
probable
that
one
company
would
have
entered
the
market,
one
or
the
other?
here,
the
question
is
assuming
that
one
would've,
what
would've
been
the
effect
on
competition
of
having
another
company
still
in
the
wings
that
might
enter
the
market
at
some
later
time?
mr.
zimmerman
phrase
it
whose
presence
on
the
edge
might
influence
decision
of
those
in
the
market.
so
that
--
it's
really
a
question
of
how
will
the
actual
competitors
be
influenced
by
the
presence
of
a
company,
one
company
in
the
wings
that
they
recognized
as
a
company
which
might
enter
the
market?
the
government
seems
to
recognize
this
in
it's
brief,
and
yet
in
the
passage
i
read
to
you
few
moments
ago,
and
yet
when
it
turns
to
deal
with
this
second
question
which
we
say
is
not
properly
presented
here
because
it
has
not
yet
been
considered
below,
when
it
turns
to
that
question,
it
ignores
entirely
the
testimony
of
the
actual
competitors
in
the
marketplace,
testimony
which
was
adduced
by
the
defendants
in
the
court
below.
it
quarrels
with
whether
a
particular
company
should
be
classed
as
a
serious
potential
entrant
or
not
on
the
basis
only
of
that
company's
internal
considerations
of
whether
or
not
it
would
enter.
and
on
that
basis
it
concedes
four
significant,
what
it
calls
potent
--
serious
potential
entrants,
pennsalt,
olin,
ppg
and
allied.
and
then
it
discusses
the
testimony,
some
of
which
mr.
connelly
has
already
adverted
to,
with
reference
to
diamond,
dow
--
alright
diamond,
wyandotte,
fmc,
kaiser
or
other
companies
in
the
chlorate-like
group
and
reasons
--
for
one
reason
or
another
that
wasn't
really
probable
that
in
fact
those
particular
companies
would
enter
the
market.
but
it
seems
to
--
and
then
it
goes
on
and
does
essentially
the
same
thing
about
the
pulp
and
paper
companies
who
later
came
to
a
consideration
of
the
same
question
of
whether
or
not
they
would
enter
the
market.
now,
your
honors
will
see
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
unfortunately
was
designated
for
putting
in
the
record
and
somehow
it
was
lost
and
shuffled.
this
exhibit
that
mr.
zimmerman
has
already
referred
to
appears
at
page
3a
of
our
brief
and
it
lists
there
all
of
the
substantial
chlor-alkali
companies
as
they
are
called,
plus
two
others
that
are
not
generally
in
the
chlor-alkali
group
which
are
chapman
chemical
company
and
virginia
chemicals.
and
then
at
page
--
it
list
them
both
in
terms
of
--
these
stipulated
facts,
terms
of
their
assets,
the
next
page,
their
land
and
equipment,
the
next
page,
their
sales,
the
next
page,
their
net
income.
and
then
we
go
through
a
similar
setting
for
--
to
the
fact
with
reference
to
the
southeastern
pulp
and
paper
companies
who
as
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
at
the
trial
on
remand
shows
were
also
considering
entry.
now
it's
perfectly
clear
turning
first
to
the
chemical
companies
the
actuality
which
is
what
the
government
--
oh,
the
likelihood
of
their
entry
what
--
which
the
government,
i
think,
mistakenly
thought
this
was
on
that
indeed
there
were
eight
or
nine
of
such
companies
which
gave
repeated,
steady
consideration
to
the
possibility
of
breaking
in
to
the
southeastern
market.
a
company
set
as
dow
chemical
which
made
--
which
had
done
research
on
it
for
years,
which
approached
the
southern
pulp
mills
in
late
1959
to
try
to
solicit
it's
method
of
delivering
chlorine
dioxide
by
putting
up
a
plant
next
door
to
the
pulp
mill
and
making
it's
own
sodium
chlorate
in
the
dow
plant
and
delivering
the
finished
product
which
is
what
the
pulp
now
really
wants,
direct
to
the
pulp
mill.
and
i
don't
think
however
that
i
should
spend
much
time
talking
more
about
the
actuality
because
in
our
contention
this
is
not
what
really
counts.
and
i
really
do
want
to
point
out
the
record
is
entirely
clear,
there
were
no
barriers
to
entry
by
any
of
the
pulp
and
paper
companies.
indeed,
it's
conceded
in
the
very
footnote
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
mr.
zimmerman
has
cited
here
and
that
it
has
not
been
contested.
it
was
also
included
in
the
some
of
the
government's
findings
of
facts.
so
no
barriers
to
entry
and
this
were
known
in
the
industry.
and
likewise
beginning
at
least
in
the
early
60's
it
became
feasible
for
the
pulp
mills
to
build
their
own
plant
because
they
could
--
in
their
own
mills,
could
take
sodium
chlorate
in
liquid
form
and
deliver
it
into
the
bleaching
part
of
their
plant,
and
thereby
avoid
paying
great
quantities
of
freight,
to
ship
it
in
the
liquid
form.
they
were
able
to
use
it
in
that
form
and
the
testimony
is
that
an
economically
feasible
operation
for
them.
as
long
as
they
manufacture
it
right
where
they
wanted
to
use
it
was
down
to
something
under
5,000
tons
per
year.
so
that
has
been
the
situation
which
has
come
to
develop.
but
what's
really
important
to
--
in
our
contention
on
the
second
issue
is
what
did
the
actual
competitors
think
about
potential
competition?
how
did
potential
competition
influence
the
market
behavior
of
the
actual
competitors
because
that's
what
we're
talking
about
if
we
assume
that
one
company
would
have
entered
and
the
others
significance
or
influence
is
only
in
respect
of
how
it
went
--
might
work
on
the
actual
operations
in
the
marketplace.
now,
we
called
on
this
subject
the
responsible
officials
of
the
hooker
chemical
company,
the
--
one
of
the
two
original
market
occupants
of
the
american
potash
company,
and
finally,
of
pittsburgh
plate
glass
which
entered
in
1961.
so
these
are
the
three
actual
competitors
of
the
marketplace.
and
mr.
(inaudible)
made
it
clear
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
potential
competition
from
the
chemical
companies
was
as
he
put
it
most
of
the
chlor-alkali
industry,
that's
the
group
that's
listed
in
the
appendix
to
which
i
have
already
referred.
mr.
neubauer
referred
to
the
chlor-alkali
group
and
mr.
dirksen
referred
to
the
chlor-alkali
manufacturers
as
a
class.
he
actually
used
the
word
as
a
class.
mr.
dirksen
said
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned,
foremost
in
the
group
was
allied.
he
said
that
pennsalt
and
olin,
he
regarded,
as
lately
entrants
but
viewed
the
whole
class
as
the
potential
competition
so
far
as
merchant
producers
were
concerned.
and
potential
competitors
such
as
dow,
mr.
(inaudible),
and
barn
of
allied,
both
recognized
that
the
potential
competition
--
and
this
goes
back
to
1960.
the
questions
were
put
to
them
as
of
1960's,
“whom
did
you
recognize
as
the
potential
competition?”
and
mr.
(inaudible)
and
mr.
barn
also
corroborated,
the
chlor-alkali
industry
as
a
group,
that's
that
large
group
of
well-financed
companies
that
i've
already
mentioned.
now,
turning
to
mr.
justice
fortas's
question,
what
was
the
influence
on
the
--
those
in
the
marketplace
and
if
you
would
look
at
the
testimony
of
mr.
cowey,
the
official
of
hooker
at
record
177,
he
makes
clear
that
yes,
the
actual
competitors
of
the
marketplace
took
into
account
the
possibility
that
anyone
of
this
group
of
chlor-alkali
producers
might
enter
the
market
and
that
tended
to
hold
the
pricing
down.
there
was
no
actual
price
change
until
1964
when
there
was
reduction
because
of
the
threat
of
captive
production
by
this
pulp
and
paper
company.
but
he
said
that,
yes,
the
presence
of
these
large
number
of
well-financed
chemical
companies,
that
i'm
--
is
not
his
terms,
i'm
not
quoting
precisely,
that
that
influence
intended
to
keep
a
break
on
the
price.
but
he
said
equally
that
that
would
have
been
unaffected
by
whether
or
not
pennsalt
or
olin
were
included
in
or
excluded
out
of
the
group
of
chlor-alkali
companies.
one
company
more
or
less
made
no
difference
and
in
fact
mr.
dirksen
testified
that
his
business
decisions
and
reactions,
this
is
an
actual
contender.
his
business
decisions
and
reactions
would
not
have
been
influenced
by
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
of
allied
chemical
in
the
group
that
he
regarded
as
the
likely
potentials
as
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
even
though
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
even
though
mr.
dirksen
regarded
allied
as
the
foremost
potential
competitor.
he
said,
you
can
put
it
in
the
group
or
take
it
out.
it
would
make
no
difference
to
him.
now,
i
didn't
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
if
you
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
--
were
not
for
the
pulp
and
paper
companies,
you
would
clearly
then
have
an
elimination
of
all
potential
competition
and
at
least
the
potential
competition
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
which
i'm
dealing
with
and
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
not
precisely
sir.
maybe
i
can
clarify
and
it's
the
problem
were
dealing
with
the
hypothetical
situation
here.
we're
dealing
with
a
question
assumed
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
and
in
fact
in
the
absence
of
this
joint
venture
that
one
would
have
entered,
the
manufacturer
out
in
the
southeast.
then
what
influence
would
the
other
who
by
hypothesis
didn't
enter
but
was
merely
pondering
and
indeed
wouldn't
have
entered
according
to
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
was
referred,
how
much
difference
does
it
make
to
preserve
that
company,
that
other
company
in
the
wings
because
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
if
the
two
companies
go
into
the
joint
venture,
then
it
means
they're
eliminated
as
separate.
they
can't
--
can
no
longer
be
looked
on
as
potential
competitors
but
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that's
correct.
and
that's
why,
as
we
have
said,
the
lessening
is
a
curious
kind
of
a
lessening.
the
lessening
really
is,
did
you
increase
competition
less
than
might
have
been
--
that
it
might
have
been
increased
under
the
hypothetical
situation
that
i've
been
talking
about.
and
we
had
the
testimony
of
professor
cooke
from
harvard
business
school,
an
economist,
who
turned
his
attention
to
the
same
subject
and
the
government
has
ignored
this
as
it's
ignored
the
actual
reactions
of
those
in
the
marketplace
and
it
seems
to
me
he
pretty
well
summed
it
up.
he
was
asked
by
and
--
by
the
court,
page
434,
“how
important
then
in
determining
a
threshold
price
would
it
be
if
one
of
these
persons
in
the
chlori
--
chlor-alkali
group
put
in
the
papers,
“we
have
no
intention
now
or
a
forever
of
going
into
the
sodium
chlorate
business
in
the
southeast?”
how
would
that
affect
the
threshold
price
and
the
answer
was
the
removal
of
one
would
make
no
difference
at
all.
the
general
threat
--
generalized
threat
of
entry
would
stay
as
strong
as
it
was
before.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
he
turned
to
a
bit
more
of
something
that's
practically
what
the
government
asserts
in
its
brief
for
the
benefit
of
the
testimony
when
he
was
asked
on
the
assumption
be
it
--
record
identifies
10
potential
merchant
producers
of
sodium
chlorate
in
the
southeast.
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
hypothesize
the
decisive
removal,
without
an
announcement
sir,
of
five
of
these
companies
as
potential
competitors,
would
the
further
removal
of
one
of
the
remaining
five
potential
competitors
have
an
effect
on
the
action
of
those
in
the
market
at
page
436.
answer,
“i
would
expect
those
in
the
market
to
react
to
four
outside
as
much
as
they
would
react
to
the
eight
outside.”
and
he
said
parenthetically
--
and
indeed
to
the
extent
that
they
reacted
at
all,
because
his
testimony
was
quite
clear
that
the
actual
competition
brought
on
by
penn-olin,
brought
on
by
ppg's
later
entry
was
more
significant
indeed
than
the
potential
competition.
and
the
testimony
of
those
in
the
marketplace
was
equally
clear
that
from
their
standpoint,
i
refer
again
to
the
officials
of
the
american
potash
and
of
hooker
and
ppg,
that
the
most
significant
potential
competition
to
them
was
that
threatened
by
the
large
group
of
pulp
and
paper
companies.
these
were
the
ultimate
consumers
and
if
they
embarked
on
the
production
of
this
product,
it
meant
that
the
commercial
producers
such
as
hooker,
american
potash,
or
later
penn-olin
was
permanently
deprived
of
a
portion
of
the
market.
and
responsive
to
the
possibility
of
captive
production,
it
was
in
1964,
that
the
price
of
this
product
in
the
southeastern
market
was
reduced.
now,
it
seems
to
us
from
this
testimony
which
i
have
briefly
summarized
on
the
second
trial
that
although
we
do
not
contend
that
this
court
should
try
to
sift
the
testimony
of
19
or
20
witnesses
adduced
at
that
trial
without
having
the
benefit
of
the
trial
judges'
comments
on
it
and
findings
on
it.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
if
there
were
to
be
any
ruling
by
this
court
on
this
record,
on
the
ultimate
issue
whether
competition
was
lessened
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
increased
as
much
by
penn-olin
as
it
might
have
been
increased
if
one
of
the
penn-olin
parents
had
entered
and
if
the
other
had
remained
interested.
even
though,
we
don't
contend
that
if
you
look
at
this
record
no
fair
reading
of
the
record
could
lead
this
court
to
conclude
other
than
that
in
fact
there
was
no
showing
of
the
lessening
of
competition
in
the
sense
that
i've
referred
to
by
the
government
and
the
record
indeed
is
just
to
the
contrary.
the
cases
that
have
been
relied
on
at
the
el
paso
case,
the
clorox
case,
the
continental
can
case,
are
quite
different
situations
although
there
was
an
element
of
potential
competition
in
those
cases.
el
paso
involved
a
company
that
was
actually
bidding
for
the
business
in
the
marketplace
and
only
one
company
which
merged
with
an
actual
competitor.
clorox
involved
the
single
substantial
potential
competitor,
the
procter
&
gamble
company,
which
the
trade
commissioner
found
and
this
court
agree
was
really
the
only
likely
entrant,
and
the
combination
between
those
two.
and
continental
can
involved
a
situation
where
there
were
--
was
both
actual
and
potential
competition
by
virtue
of
the
definition
of
the
market
between
the
two
companies
that
were
involved
in
that
transaction,
so
none
of
them
presents
a
situation
such
as
is
presented
in
this
case.
in
our
contention,
the
district
court's
finding
was
correct
neither
pennsalt
nor
olin
would,
as
a
reasonable
probability,
have
entered
the
market.
but
even
if
that
finding
were
not
correct
in
our
contention,
there
was
no
lessening
of
competition
by
the
elimination
of
the
other
joint
venture
parent
from
the
ranks
of
potential
competitors
of
whom
there
were
a
great
number
in
this
case.
thank
you.
