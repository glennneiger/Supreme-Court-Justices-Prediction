mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
joint
venture
entered
into
in
1960
by
the
pennsalt
chemical
corporation
and
the
olin
mathieson
chemical
corporation.
the
joint
venture
called
the
penn-olin
company
was
for
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
a
chemical
called
sodium
chlorate
in
the
southeastern
region
of
the
united
states
where
the
chemical
has
several
uses.
its
major
use
is
to
make
chlorine
dioxide,
a
bleach
for
the
pulp
and
paper
industry.
in
january
1961
the
government
filed
a
suit
under
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act
attacking
the
joint
venture
and
the
transactions
relating
to
it.
a
complaint
was
amended
in
august
1961
and
trial
began
in
october
1961.
at
the
first
trial,
the
district
court
believed
that
illegality
under
the
clayton
act
required
a
showing
that
but
for
the
joint
venture
both
parents
would
have
entered
the
market.
since
the
district
court
did
not
believe
that
a
showing
had
been
made,
that
both
parents
would
have
entered
the
market,
it
dismissed
the
case.
the
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court,
and
in
june
1964,
this
court
reversed
and
remanded.
this
court
stressed
the
importance
of
potential
competition,
of
the
competition
of
the
firm
on
the
edge
of
the
market
whose
presence
might
affect
the
pricing
decisions
of
those
in
the
market.
this
court
therefore
told
the
district
court
to
make
a
finding
on
the
question
whether
one
firm
would
have
entered
the
market
and
the
other
firm
remained
as
a
potential
entrant
hovering
on
the
edge
of
the
market.
further
trial
was
had
on
this
issue
and
the
district
court
this
time
concluded
that
neither
company
was
a
potential
entrant.
since
it
concluded
that
neither
company
was
a
potential
entrant,
it
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
find
whether
one
would
have
hovered
at
the
edge
of
the
market.
we
are
here
today
because
we
believe
that
the
standard
use
by
the
district
court
for
evaluating
the
question
of
probable
entry
is
incorrect.
the
district
court
in
effect
held
that
for
the
united
states
to
prevail
in
the
case
such
as
this,
it
must
show
that
top
management
actually
decided
to
enter
independently
as
an
alternative
to
the
joint
venture.
let
me
illustrate
what
we
feel
to
be
the
difficulty
of
the
court's
approach.
the
district
court's
opinion
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
the
fate
of
internal
corporate
proposals
to
enter
the
market.
the
district
court's
opinion
reveals
that
both
in
the
case
of
olin
and
in
the
case
of
pennsalt,
even
looking
at
this
evidence
alone
we
see
a
growing
prospect
of
near
commitment
to
internal
entry.
hence,
in
the
case
of
pennsalt,
after
more
than
five
years
of
study,
the
president
in
november
1958
is
authorized
to
press
the
button
to
make
independent
entry
a
reality
if
he
so
desires.
he
discovers
some
overestimates
of
demand
and
in
january
1959,
the
proposal
is
revised
to
take
these
overestimates
into
account.
but
also
in
january
1959,
the
president
of
pennsalt
has
indicated
in
the
district
judges'
opinion,
page
828
of
the
record,
mr.
drake
accidentally
met
mr.
logan
of
olin
mathieson
and
the
two
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
at
that
time
the
proposal
for
independent
entry
was
put
on
ice,
pending
for
the
discussion
of
the
joint
venture.
again,
we
are
told
by
the
district
judges'
opinion
that
as
of
november
1959,
independent
construction
by
olin
at
page
816
appeared
to
be
definitely
more
of
a
possibility
that
it
had
been.
but
again,
a
curtain
descends
and
the
joint
venture
itself
is
shortly
entered
into.
in
fact,
neither
of
the
proposals,
the
pennsalt
plan
of
january
1959,
the
olin
plan
of
november
1959
for
independent
entry,
neither
proposal
was
rejected.
in
fact,
both
proposals
represented
the
culmination
of
long
sustained
efforts.
in
fact
both
appeared
to
make
economic
sense.
but
the
district
court
states
that
neither
proposal
had
in
fact
been
presented
to
top
management.
moreover,
we
are
told
on
page
823
of
the
record
the
following,
even
if
the
olin
proposal
had
been
presented
to
top
management,
no
intelligent
forecast
can
be
made
as
to
the
likelihood
of
its
approval
by
the
board
of
directors
who
had
the
final
say.
only
two
of
the
15
members
of
the
board
were
officers
of
olin.
the
names
of
some
of
the
other
members
marked
them
as
man
of
broad
financial
and
business
experience,
whether
these
men
were
hypercritical
or
easily
persuaded
to
accept
management
proposals
is
not
disclosed.
they're
record
in
approving
or
disapproving
such
proposals
is
not
revealed.
what
their
views
would
have
been
about
a
wholly
owned
chlorate
facility
cannot
be
conjectured.
we
disagree
that
an
intelligent
forecast
cannot
be
made
without
this
detailed
analysis
of
the
preferences
of
each
individual
member
of
the
board
but
we
agree
or
we
argue
that
an
intelligent
forecast
cannot
be
made
by
a
standard
that
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
evidence
of
managerial
reaction
to
independent
entry
at
a
particular
hour
and
date
and
ignores
the
economic
circumstances
in
which
the
company
finds
it
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
did
not,
the
government
believe
that
the
record
that
it
had
previously
made
and
which
this
court
had
previously
reviewed
had
not
been
rebutted
by
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe
that
this
opinion
reflects
the
district
court's
almost
complete
overlooking
at
this
point
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
firms
found
themselves
in
their
market.
it
concentrates
almost
exclusively
on
what
went
on
within
particular
divisions
and
within
the
boardroom.
we
also
argue
that
a
intelligent
evaluation
cannot
be
made
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
managerial
reaction
to
independent
entry
at
the
time
when
management
is
in
fact
evaluating
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
and
we
note
in
this
case
that
ever
since
1958,
the
two
companies
had
been
consulting
with
one
another
on
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
we
also
note
that
we
cannot
meet
the
court's
requirement
of
having
top
management
even
consider
the
proposal
when
it
is
the
very
fact
of
the
joint
venture
that
leads
top
management
to
ignore
the
proposal.
hence,
we
are
here
to
argue
that
the
standard
for
an
evaluation
of
whether
a
company
was
a
probable
entrant
cannot
be
the
standard
that
the
district
court
applied.
secondly,
we
shall
argue
that
under
an
appropriate
standard
applied
to
this
case,
the
government
has
proved,
at
least,
that
either
pennsalt
or
olin
would
have
entered
and
that
the
other
would
remain
a
significant
potential
competitor.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
there
are
some
findings
which
are
clearly
erroneous,
we
note
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
--
true,
depending
on
how
they
are
interpreted,
but
it's
very
hard
to
get
to
the
question
of
clearly
erroneous
when
the
standard
by
which
the
findings
are
made
is
erroneous.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
a
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
located
--
after
it
launched
is
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
one
is
if
the
court
was
assessed
--
asserting
that
the
so-called
investment
minimum
had
not
been
met,
that
was
clearly
erroneous.
now
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
if
we
persuade
you
that
under
a
proper
standard,
there
would
have
been
actual
entry
and
potential
competition
remaining
at
the
edge
of
the
market.
we
believed
that
this
court
can,
if
it
so
desires,
dispose
of
the
case
at
this
time
although
we
also
recognized
that
ordinarily,
you
were
to
remand
the
case
for
a
finding
of
violation
on
the
basis
of
a
proper
standard
of
entry.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
what
should
be
a
proper
standard
for
determining
entry.
i
should
like
to
start
by
referring
to
two
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
in
order
to
demonstrate
where
our
standard
that
we
proposed
comes
from.
i
refer
you
first
to
your
decision
in
this
case
378
u.s.
at
page
175.
after
reviewing
several
factors
concerning
the
market
structure
in
which
these
two
companies
operated,
concerning
their
capabilities,
concerning
their
interest,
this
court
said,
“unless
we
are
going
to
require
subjective
evidence,
this
array
of
probability
certainly
reaches
the
prima
facie
stage.”
as
we
have
indicated,
to
require
more
would
be
to
read
the
statutory
requirement
of
reasonable
probability
into
a
requirement
of
certainty.
this
we
will
not
do.
secondly,
recently
this
court
had
occasioned
to
address
itself
again
to
the
question
of
probable
entry
in
procter
&
gamble.
and
at
386
u.s.
and
580,
referring
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
potential
competition
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
management's
decision
to
enter
independently
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
an
actual
attempt
to
enter.
this
court
reached
the
conclusion
of
procter
&
gamble
was
the
most
likely
potential
entrant
from
evidence
as
to
procter's
activity
in
the
industry,
activity
is
similar
to
the
liquid
bleach
product,
procter's
program
of
diversifying
the
natural
avenue
of
expansion
represented
by
procter's
ability
to
use
similar
distribution
methods,
and
procter's
capabilities,
resources
and
special
advantages.
this
court
in
fact,
in
effect
i
believe,
looked
at
objective
economic
criteria
not
at
the
specifics
of
subjective
managerial
reactions
at
a
particular
time
and
place
to
make
an
overall
evaluation.
now
from
these
two
cases,
we
suggest
that
a
useful
rule
and
a
rule
which
would
lead
to
predictable
accuracy
would
be
as
follows.
first,
we
would
ask
does
the
company
have
the
capabilities
of
entering.
by
that
i
mean
does
it
have
the
technology,
the
know-how,
the
financial
resources.
if
it
does,
i
believe
it
is
at
least
a
possible
entry,
but
not
necessarily
a
probable
entrant.
the
second
question
is
designed
to
isolate
those
of
the
possible
entrants,
which
are
probable
entrants,
and
there
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
why
would
this
company
at
this
time
commit
its
resources
in
this
direction
rather
than
that
direction.
there,
there
are
a
variety
of
considerations
which
some
into
play
and
bearing
on
the
question
of
special
incentive.
as
in
procter
&
gamble,
it
might
be
that
the
new
market
is
in
the
area
of
the
natural
expansion
of
the
company
because
of
the
interrelationship
of
the
new
market
to
the
current
market.
or
again
as
in
procter
&
gamble,
the
company
may
enjoy
some
special
advantages
which
would
make
the
new
market
particularly
attractive
to
it
and
would
give
a
promise
of
the
good
profit
margin.or
indications
of
special
interest
may
be
reflected
by
sustained
and
intense
examination
of
this
particular
market
by
the
company.
and
in
the
case
such
as
this
where
in
fact
you
have
independent
entry,
i
don't
mean
independent
entry,
you
have
new
entry
via
a
joint
venture
and
the
commitment
of
three
and
three
quarter
million
dollars
by
each.
i
think
that
is
an
indication
that
this
is
not
just
another
possible
area
of
interest
that
the
companies
had
a
special
interest
in
this
market.
now,
the
virtues
of
the
test
that
we
proposed
is
combination
of
capabilities
and
special
incentive
or
that
it's
consonant
with
the
economic
forces
that
would
lead
to
predictions
which
the
economics
of
the
situation
would
lead
to.
it
would
not
have
any
particular
disincentive
effect
since
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
joint
venture
where
the
two
companies
cannot
individually
go
in,
that
would
be
taken
cared
of
by
the
capabilities
part
of
the
test.
thirdly,
it
avoids
the
vices
of
a
rule
such
as
used
by
the
court
below
where
there
is
virtually
exclusive
reliance
on
evidence
of
how
management
reacted
at
a
time
when
it
wasn't
focusing
on
independent
entry
without
having
before
it
the
prospect
of
joint
entry.
it
would
also
avoid
the
problem
of
evaluating
evidence
which
might
be
manufactured
to
avoid
antitrust
difficulties.
now
we
believe
that
such
a
test
was
implicitly
applied
by
this
court
to
this
case
the
last
time
this
case
was
here.
and
i
should
like
to
advert
again
to
this
court's
opinion
previously.
and
the
opinion
examined
the
evidence
then
before
the
court
and
this
court
stated,
the
evidence
shows
beyond
question
that
the
industry
was
rapidly
expanding,
the
relevant
southeast
market
was
important,
few
corporations
had
the
inclination,
resources,
and
know-how.
both
parents
of
penn-olin
had
great
resources,
each
had
long
been
identified
with
the
industry,
one
owned
a
valuable
patent
right
while
the
other
actually
engaged
in
sodium
chlorate
production.
each
had
other
chemicals
which
used
sodium
chlorate.
each
had
sustained
a
long
interest
in
entering
the
relevant
market
right
up
to
the
creation
of
the
joint
venture.
each
enjoyed
good
reputation
with
the
customers.
each
had
the
know-how
and
the
capacity.
each
could
have
done
so
at
a
reasonable
profit.
each
had
compelling
reasons.
pennsalt
needed
to
expand
its
sales.
olin
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
it
was
already
buying
sodium
chlorate,
and
that
it
was
promoting
a
process
for
using
it.
and
at
this
point
the
court
reached
the
conclusion,
unless
we
are
going
to
require
a
subjective
evidence,
this
array
of
probability
certainly
reaches
the
prima
facie
stage.
so
at
this
point
that
the
case
was
sent
back
for
further
evidence
on
the
question
whether
one
company
would
have
entered
and
one
company
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
market.
while
appellees
on
remand
put
in
additional
evidence
on
alleged
changes
in
the
market
after
the
joint
venture
took
place
and
cumulated
previous
testimony
as
to
managerial
thoughts
and
intentions,
the
basic
facts
reviewed
by
this
court
making
for
a
conclusion
of
probably
entry
are
unrebutted.
these
facts
were
found
by
the
district
court
in
its
first
decision.
penn
and
olin
each
had
the
resources
and
the
capabilities.
penn
was
one
of
the
very
few
actual
producers
of
sodium
chloride.
there
were
only
three
producers
of
this
commodity
in
the
country
at
that
time.
penn
was
--
pennsalt
was
one
of
them.
olin,
on
the
other
hand,
had
developed
a
process
of
its
own
for
the
production
of
pennsalt
--
of
sodium
chlorate
in
anticipation
of
entry
and
had
also
access
to
the
vickers-krebs
process.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
facts
on
the
record
in
this
case
which
i
believe
when
tested
by
a
proper
standard
compelled
a
conclusion
that
there
would
have
been
probable
entry
here.
these,
as
the
district
court
found
in
its
first
decision
comprised
the
following.
each
parent
had
ample
resources
and
capabilities
for
entering.
pennsalt
had
the
rare
actual
manufacturing
experience.
olin
had
a
substantially
developed
process
for
production
of
sodium
chlorate
of
its
own
and
in
addition
had
accessed
to
the
vickers-krebs
process.
olin
had
been
actually
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
sodium
chlorate
to
the
southeast
market,
to
the
pulp
customers
in
that
market.
pennsalt
had
marketing
experience
in
the
sale
of
sodium
chlorate
elsewhere
which
was
readily
transferable.
each
possessed
a
plant
site
at
which
a
factory
could
have
been
constructed.
each
had
financing
ability
to
construct
the
plant.
so
far
as
incentive
is
concerned,
the
market
itself
was
growing
rapidly.
it
was
highly
concentrated
with
two
companies
having
over
90%
of
the
business.
pennsalt,
a
producer
of
sodium
chlorate
could
develop
a
new
market
for
its
sodium
chlorate
and
for
other
chemicals.
olin,
because
of
its
work
in
installing
the
mathieson
process
which
was
the
most
commonly
used
bleaching
process
by
the
pulp
industry
possessed
ample
goodwill
and
ample
opportunity
to
sell
to
the
pulp
companies,
the
sodium
chlorate
they
needed
for
the
input
to
this
olin
mathieson
process.
finally,
there
has
been
a
longstanding
interest
on
the
part
of
both
companies
in
this
market.
there
had
been
indications
of
profitable
activity
possible.
and
finally,
we
have
indeed
here
the
fact
of
an
actual
investment
of
$7
and
a
half
million
at
a
10.1%
rate
of
return.
it
was
facts
such
as
these
that
i
think
this
court
applied
a
standard
similar
to
the
one
that
we
are
here
proposing
at
it
--
at
the
last
decision
and
which
led
this
court
to
believe
that
at
the
least
a
prima
facie
showing
had
been
made.
the
prima
facie
showing
has
not
rebutted
by
the
evidence
submitted
by
appellees.
the
evidence
submitted
by
appellees
largely
concerns
itself
with
developments
which
appeared
well
after
the
joint
venture
was
entered
into.
and
indeed,
i
believe
it
is
significant
that
the
district
judge
in
reaching
his
conclusion
that
there
was
no
probability
of
entry
does
not
rely
on
these
after
acquisition
events
for
his
conclusion.
the
principle
events
that
appellees
point
to,
they
urged
that
the
growth
and
demand
which
this
court
had
noted
as
a
significant
factor
in
explaining
the
incentive
for
entry
was
declining.
the
appellees
note
that
the
price
of
sodium
chlorate
was
declining.
and
the
appellees
note
that
there
was
a
threat
of
new
entry
from
the
pulp
and
paper
customers
and
the
appellees
would
argue
that
these
events
had
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
probable
entry
and
therefore
on
a
question
of
violation
in
this
case.
taking
first
the
question
of
price,
it
is
the
case
that
in
1964,
october
1964,
over
four
years
after
the
joint
venture
was
established
there
was
a
price
decline.
this
is
the
only
price
decline.
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
price
decline
four
years
after
the
fact
was
anticipated
at
the
time
the
joint
venture
was
entered
into.
it
would
therefore
have
no
bearing
on
whether
either
party
would
have
been
deterred
from
independent
entry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
look
at
page
551,
an
august
1960
document
at
the
very
time
of
the
inception
of
the
joint
venture,
where
we
have
a
request
for
appropriations
for
the
joint
venture
to
--
i
take
at
the
olin
management,
we
see
in
paragraph
three
the
following:
“in
view
of
the
stability
of
the
market
over
the
past
few
years,
we
anticipate
no
major
price
changes
during
the
next
five
years”.
now
that
was
the
state
of
mind
of
pennsalt
and
olin
at
the
time
they
entered
the
market.
they
were
not
anticipating
a
decline
of
price,
and
indeed
there
was
no
decline
in
price
until
four
years
later
which
they
freely
could
not
have
anticipated.
as
to
demand,
here
we'd
like
to
refer
to
the
appellee's
brief
where
in
appendix
2a,
on
page
2a,
they
have
provided
an
indication
of
what
happened
subsequently.
and
on
page
2a
we
find
that
the
production
in
the
market
in
1962
was
66,293
tons,
in
1963,
77,771
tons,
1964,
88,967
tons.
my
arithmetic
tells
me
that
this
represents
a
rate
of
growth
in
1962-1963,
i
believe
of
over
17%
and
on
1963-1964
of
over
14%.
now,
i
admit
that
there
is
a
decline
from
17%
to
14%,
but
nonetheless
the
testimony
indicated
that
the
usual
rate
of
growth
was
10%
at
the
time
of
the
joint
venture.
and
the
testimony
also
indicated
that
the
ordinary
rate
of
growth
in
the
chemical
industry
as
a
whole
is
5%
or
6%.
i
do
not
regard
this
as
indicating
any
radical
change
in
demand
which
could
have
been
anticipated
or
which
indeed
had
any
effect
on
the
question
of
entry
at
the
time
that
entry
occurred.
moreover
i
would
bring
the
court's
attention
to
same
table
in
1964,
the
hooker
chemical
company
which
was
one
of
the
established
entrants,
we
note
from
footnote
3
that
in
1964
it
has
further
capacity
under
construction.
so
that
we
scarcely
have
the
picture
here
of
a
market
which
has
suddenly
taken
a
radical
change
toward
diminution
and
decline.
the
third
major
factor
that
appellees
point
to
as
a
development
which
in
some
way
affected
the
question
of
entry
was
the
rise
of
the
threat
of
production
of
sodium
chlorate
by
the
pulp
and
paper
industry
itself.
and
indeed,
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
1964
price
drop
was
in
part
stimulated
by
threats
of
the
consumers
to
build
their
own
plants.
now
again,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
this
threat
was
a
lively
or
obvious
one
at
the
time
the
joint
venture
was
set
up.
that
it
would
have
deterred
either
pennsalt
or
olin
from
going
into
the
joint
venture.
and
indeed
the
best
inference
i
can
draw
from
this
development
is
that
it
was
the
highly
concentrated
nature
of
the
sodium
chlorate
market
that
forced
the
customers
to
seek
a
way
of
avoiding
this
high
and
stable
price
by
seeking
new
technology.
i
would
also
note
that
as
of
the
date
of
remand,
1965,
there
had
been
no
construction
of
plants
by
the
captive
producers
--
i'm
sorry,
by
the
captive
producers
i
mean
consumers
who
build
their
own
supplies.
so
that
even
if
this
began
to
emerged
as
a
factor,
it
would
have
been
emerging
in
the
mid-60's
and
could
not
have
had
any
effect
on
pennsalt
or
olin
at
the
time
that
they
were
making
their
decisions
to
enter
and
would
not
have
seriously
inhibited
their
continuing
concern
and
continuing
interest
in
the
market.
again,
i
point
out
that
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
these
after
the
acquisition
developments
for
its
findings
that
there
was
no
probability
of
entry.
it
simply
said
that
these
subsequent
developments
after
the
venture
make
it
even
less
likely
that
they
would
have
gone
in.
now,
i
would
also
wish
to
argue
that
not
only
would
one
of
the
firms
have
entered
under
the
test
as
we
understand
it
as
we
think
it
should
be
and
under
the
record
as
it
exist.
but
we
also
believe
that
the
entry
of
the
one
firm
would
not
have
deterred
the
remaining
firm
from
continuing
its
long
existent
interest
in
entering.
here
i
would
note
that
we
have
the
phenomenon
of
both
firms
knowing
for
several
years
that
each
was
considering
independent
entry
or
possible
joint
entry.
they
had
the
relationships
since
1958
where
they
would
advice
one
another
of
new
developments.
there
is
no
indication
in
any
of
their
thinking
at
that
point
that
they
said,
“well,
if
olin
beats
me,
i,
pennsalt
will
not
go
in”,
or
“if
pennsalt
beats
me,
i,
olin
would
not
go
in.”
we
don't
see
any
indication
of
that.
secondly,
as
i've
suggested,
this
market
has
continued
to
expand
and
even
after
the
entry
of
a
combined
penn-olin,
and
a
rather
larger
tonnage
than
was
anticipated
by
either
one,
we
find
that
the
pittsburg
plate
glass
company
was
not
deterred
from
entry
and
it
found
room
to
build
a
15,000-ton
capacity.
and
we
find
as
i
have
just
indicated
that
hooker
found
it
desirable
to
expand
its
capacity
in
1964.
i
think
this
suggests
that
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
mere
fact
that
actual
entry
by
one
would
have
upset
or
change
this
long-sustained
rational
interest
that
each
company
had
in
this
market.
i
would
rather
suspect
that
one
would
have
followed
the
other
in
shortly
thereafter,
but
that
isn't
necessary
for
our
case.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
mr.
justice
white,
there
were
no
decisions
not
to
go
in.
what
happened
here
is
you
have
some
projects
hang
in
fire
and
then
nothing
more
is
heard
from
them.
and
all
the
focus
on
attention
moves
on
to
the
joint
venture.
we
have
in
fact
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
decision
not
to
go
in.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
there
was
--
certainly
not
at
the
january
1959
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
yes,
but
that
was
the
district
court's
ultimate
conclusion.
but
the
district
court
did
not
find
decisions
not
to
go
in.
in
other
words
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
factual
finding
that
the
board
of
directors
sat
down
in
january
of
1959,
the
pennsalt
board
of
directors
and
looked
at
the
proposal
which
is
set
forth
on
page
730
of
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
on
the
fact
that
the
management
never
considered
these
proposals,
that
top
management
never
approved
these
proposals,
and
that
there's
no
way
of
predicting
that
top
management
would've
--
approved
it,
the
proposal.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
white
that
that
was
a
somewhat
harder
case,
but
i
would
still
suggest
that
even
there,
you
would
not
want
to
rely
solely
and
exclusively
on
such
a
decision.
and
that
you
would
have
to
give
some
attention
to
the
other
factors
to
which
i
refer
and
let
me
illustrate
why.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
for
this
reason
that
the
--
and
it
depends
on
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
same
decision.
if
you
are
referring
to
a
decision
not
to
go
in
made
at
a
time
when
the
board
of
directors
has
before
it,
the
prospects
of
the
joint
venture,
which
they
very
much
want,
i
would
suggest
that
their
decision
not
to
go
in
cannot
be
dispositive.
no,
i
do
not
say
that
it
does
not
have
considerable
significance,
but
it
should
not
be
dispositive.
we
have
seen
in
the
antitrust
field
other
situations
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that's
right,
i
would
slot
it
in.
but
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
we
will
know
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes
mr.
justice
white.
this
opinion
spends
virtually
no
time
at
all.
no
space
at
all
in
considering
pennsalt's
capacity
or
the
state
of
the
market
or
the
incentives
to
enter.
this
opinion
is
radically
different
from
the
findings
on
which
this
court
relied
earlier.
it's
confined
almost
solely
to
an
examination
of
proposals
and
responses.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
i
argue
that
we
cannot
give
that
conclusive
weight
but
it
goes
into
the
package
that
you
take
the
overall
array
of
considerations.
now
i
don't
think
there
is
apt
to
be
that
this
kind
of
great
disparity
between
what
is
economically
desirable
to
the
company
in
the
way
their
corporation
might
react
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
think
that
decisions
made
in
such
a
context
would
have
far
more
appropriative
weight
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
than
the
decisions
made
here.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
there
were
none
decisions
in
--
again,
there
were
no
--
and
the
problem
here
is
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
management
never
made
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
were
decisions
made
to
go
via
the
joint
venture
but
two
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
proposals
were
left
hanging
in
fire.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
certainly.
your
honor,
i
mean
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
inevitable
consequence
of
going
in
jointly
as
that
one
doesn't
go
in
alone.
yes,
i
am
suggesting
that
you
cannot
give
--
well,
in
the
situation
here,
in
the
situation
where
the
joint
venture
is
always
the
context
of
decision
making,
you
cannot
give
the
decision
to
go
into
the
joint
venture
rather
than
to
go
individually.
(inaudible)
cannot
say
that
therefore,
had
the
joint
venture
never
existed,
they
would
have
not
gone
in.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
when
this
case
was
last
here,
this
court
all
but
found
probable
entry
and
remanded
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
prima
facie
case
of
probable
entry
and
i
assumed
that
the
appellees
were
to
have
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
case.
i
would
suppose
that
what
i
am
suggesting
is
quite
consistent
with
what
this
court
have
previously
done.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
if
i
may
on
the
question
of
whether
assuming
that
i
have
persuaded
you
that
the
standard
for
entry
and
for
judging
entry
that
i
proposed
is
an
appropriate
one.
and
assuming
that
you
agree
with
me
that
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
one
would
have
gone
in
and
the
other
at
least
hovered,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
the
question
of
whether
this
would
constitute
a
violation
of
section
7.
and
in
this
regard
i
wish
to
note
very
briefly
that
you
have
here
a
very
highly
concentrated
industry
with
two
companies
having
over
90%
assuming
that
olin
or
penn
had
gone
in,
you
would've
had
three
companies
representing
100%
of
the
industry.
it
also
note
that
the
structure
of
the
industry
hasn't
changed
in
five
years.
i
would
urge
that
when
you
have
a
three-company
industry
and
--
but
when
you
have
as
you
have
here
but
very
few
potential
entrants
of
any
significance,
and
if
one
of
those
very
few
potential
entrants
of
any
significance
is
the
other
partner
here,
i
would
urge
that
the
result
of
the
joint
venture
was
to
remove
as
a
control
or
as
an
influence
on
the
market
one
of
the
very
few
influences
that
existed
and
that
this
would
be
a
basis
for
finding
a
violation
of
section
7.
now,
i
well
understand
that
there
has
--
there
have
not
been
findings
on
this
point
on
the
case
below.
we
have
analyzed
in
great
detail
the
evidence
that
has
been
put
in.
our
analysis
demonstrates
i
believe
that
at
most
there
were
two
or
three
potential
entrants
which
had
the
significance
and
vitality
under
olin
and
that
the
other
chemical
companies
were
distinguishable
because
they
had
no
experience
in
producing
sodium
chlorate.
they
had
no
experience
in
selling
sodium
chlorate.
they
had
no
plant
sites.
they
had
no
record
of
similar
sustained
interest
which
has
been
going
on
in
this
case
for
years
on
behalf
of
these
two
companies.
and
unlike
these
two
companies,
they
did
not
in
fact
invest
substantial
sums
of
money
in
this
business.
i
therefore
think
there
was
a
small
group
of
potential
entrants
and
olin
for
--
of
that
group,
the
joint
venture
has
deprived
this
market
of
the
competition
that
that
potential
entry
could
well
have
provided.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
if
there
were
a
remand
for
determination
of
the
question
of
violation
and
if
there
were
a
full-pledge
hearing
on
whether
there
would
be
distinguishable
factors
between
penn
and
olin
has
potential
entrants
and
others,
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
be
all
advised
not
to
put
more
evidence
in
but
i
think
we
have
made
our
case
now.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
be
sending
it
back
for
appropriate
relief,
the
relief
we
had
asked
for
dissolution
of
the
joint
venture
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
which
would
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
brennan
i
would
be
quite
happy
if
we
understand
and
if
we
developed
a
proper
standard
for
entry
and
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate
to
send
the
case
back
to
see
how
that
standard
works.
however,
this
case
has
been
here
before.
we
have
had
a
very
full
provision
of
evidence,
the
appellees
put
in
all
their
evidence
on
the
question
of
violation.
i
think
this
court
could
well
dispose
of
this
case
now
and
that
would
make
me
happier
still.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
but
we
make
it
clear
that
we
understand
that
this
is
not
a
normal
procedure
of
this
court.
we
simply
suggest
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
case
in
which
not
to
remand
for
further
trial.
we've
had
seven
years
now.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice
i'd
like
to
comment
on
several
--
of
the
points
made.
it
seems
to
me
that
appellees
cannot
argue
simultaneously
that
we're
dealing
with
the
market
surrounded
by
a
host
of
possible
entrants,
namely
the
rest
of
the
chlor-alkali
industry,
always
on
the
edge
--
always
exercising
influence
on
the
price
in
the
market.
and
at
the
same
time
argue
that
the
captive
producers'
threat
of
emergence
in
1964
led
to
a
price
break.
clearly,
if
you
have
a
market
of
actual
and
potential
competitors
consisting
of
some
13
or
15
companies
which
is
what
i
understand
the
appellees
to
argue,
i
would
assume
that
the
market
price
must
be
somewhere
near
a
competitive
level
and
it
would
not
require
a
threat
of
rebellion
by
the
consumers
to
lead
finally
to
a
price
reduction.
i
think
the
significant
threat,
if
there
were
one,
emerged
in
1964
or
in
1965,
the
other
chemical
companies
were
not
regarded
and
did
not
have
the
effect
on
the
market
that
is
claimed
beforehand,
else
we
would
not
see
the
phenomenon
of
the
price
break
in
response
to
the
threat
of
the
consumer.
now,
if
what
we
have
here
is
the
emergence,
three
or
four
years
after
the
joint
venture,
of
a
reaction
by
the
consumer
which
indeed
does
for
the
first
time
placed
a
restraint
on
the
ability
of
the
members
of
this
highly
concentrated
market
to
maintain
an
absolutely
stable
price,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
joint
venture
was
not
a
violation
at
the
time
it
was
consummated.
the
argument
in
effect,
i
believe
that
appellees
are
making,
is
that
if
you
have
a
joint
venture
which
maintains
a
tightly
concentrated
industry
and
if
as
a
result
there
is
an
absolute
stability
of
prices
so
that
consumers
finally
search
out
other
devices,
and
if
four
years
later,
the
sellers
respond
to
this
new
threat
by
lowering
their
prices,
the
joint
venture
is
in
some
sense
legitimatize
retroactively.
this
i
think
cannot
be
a
theory
that
this
court
can
abide.
now
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
there
would
be
an
enhancement
of
competition,
we
must
note
that
when
we
are
speaking
about
the
question
of
violation
we
are
assuming
the
entry
of
one
firm
and
the
continued
presence
on
the
edge
of
the
market
of
another.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
single
olin
or
a
single
pennsalt
could
not
have
competed
effectively
and
in
a
market
as
highly
concentrated
as
this,
i
think
it
is
peculiarly
important
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
a
second
firm
which
might
have
threatened
to
enter
through
new
technology
and
indeed
which
might
have
ultimately
entered.
i
should
think
that
this
would
be
a
great
contribution
to
competition.
i
would
also
like
to
note
that
mr.
delone
misreads
the
significance
of
note
18
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
what
we
were
contending
against
was
the
court's
finding
that
pennsalt's
process
was
in
some
sense
superior
to
olin's
process.
we
were
not
contending
that
the
possession
of
a
process
for
making
sodium
chlorate
was
not
significant.
we
were
saying
each
of
these
were
uniquely
situated
and
that
they
had
processes,
and
in
this
respect
they
were
significantly
different
than
the
other
members
of
this
industry.
finally,
i
should
like
to
note
with
respect
to
the
assertions
that
there
was
something
magical
about
the
investment
rate
of
return
that
explained
the
reluctance
of
pennsalt
to
go
forward
with
its
project
or
the
reluctance
of
olin
to
go
forward
with
the
october
or
november
1959
project,
the
argument
asserted
is
that
--
but
for
the
joint
venture
there
could
be
no
borrowing.
without
borrowing
there
could
be
no
leverage
effect.
without
leverage
effect
there
could
be
no
substantial
profit.
this
simply
is
not
the
case
and
the
court
does
not
so
claim,
and
the
record
disputes
it.
if
the
court
found
on
page
834
that
the
court's
estimate
in
pennsalt
indicated
a
rate
of
return
of
26.2%
without
borrowing
and
then
in
footnote
28
with
50%
of
the
capital
borrowing
--
borrowed
the
combined
project
gave
a
rate
of
return
of
42.7%.
and
if
you
look
at
supporting
documents,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
combined
--
that
the
borrowing
was
to
be
by
pennsalt
alone
and
this
is
at
the
time
when
commutations
were
made
for
a
pennsalt
only
project.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
pennsalt
from
borrowing
and
getting
the
leverage
effect.
there's
nothing
that
prevent
olin
from
borrowing,
from
getting
the
leverage
effect.
and
in
fact
the
nub
of
the
matter
is
that
they
went
forward
with
the
transaction
without
borrowing.
and
they
went
forward
at
a
time
when
they
knew
they
were
walking
into
antitrust
problems
and
when
they
--
would
know
that
if
borrowing
were
the
key
elements
that
they
would
think
twice
about
the
transaction.
that's
all
i
have.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
joint
venture
entered
into
in
1960
by
the
pennsalt
chemical
corporation
and
the
olin
mathieson
chemical
corporation.
the
joint
venture
called
the
penn-olin
company
was
for
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
a
chemical
called
sodium
chlorate
in
the
southeastern
region
of
the
united
states
where
the
chemical
has
several
uses.
its
major
use
is
to
make
chlorine
dioxide,
a
bleach
for
the
pulp
and
paper
industry.
in
january
1961
the
government
filed
a
suit
under
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act
attacking
the
joint
venture
and
the
transactions
relating
to
it.
a
complaint
was
amended
in
august
1961
and
trial
began
in
october
1961.
at
the
first
trial,
the
district
court
believed
that
illegality
under
the
clayton
act
required
a
showing
that
but
for
the
joint
venture
both
parents
would
have
entered
the
market.
since
the
district
court
did
not
believe
that
a
showing
had
been
made,
that
both
parents
would
have
entered
the
market,
it
dismissed
the
case.
the
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court,
and
in
june
1964,
this
court
reversed
and
remanded.
this
court
stressed
the
importance
of
potential
competition,
of
the
competition
of
the
firm
on
the
edge
of
the
market
whose
presence
might
affect
the
pricing
decisions
of
those
in
the
market.
this
court
therefore
told
the
district
court
to
make
a
finding
on
the
question
whether
one
firm
would
have
entered
the
market
and
the
other
firm
remained
as
a
potential
entrant
hovering
on
the
edge
of
the
market.
further
trial
was
had
on
this
issue
and
the
district
court
this
time
concluded
that
neither
company
was
a
potential
entrant.
since
it
concluded
that
neither
company
was
a
potential
entrant,
it
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
find
whether
one
would
have
hovered
at
the
edge
of
the
market.
we
are
here
today
because
we
believe
that
the
standard
use
by
the
district
court
for
evaluating
the
question
of
probable
entry
is
incorrect.
the
district
court
in
effect
held
that
for
the
united
states
to
prevail
in
the
case
such
as
this,
it
must
show
that
top
management
actually
decided
to
enter
independently
as
an
alternative
to
the
joint
venture.
let
me
illustrate
what
we
feel
to
be
the
difficulty
of
the
court's
approach.
the
district
court's
opinion
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
the
fate
of
internal
corporate
proposals
to
enter
the
market.
the
district
court's
opinion
reveals
that
both
in
the
case
of
olin
and
in
the
case
of
pennsalt,
even
looking
at
this
evidence
alone
we
see
a
growing
prospect
of
near
commitment
to
internal
entry.
hence,
in
the
case
of
pennsalt,
after
more
than
five
years
of
study,
the
president
in
november
1958
is
authorized
to
press
the
button
to
make
independent
entry
a
reality
if
he
so
desires.
he
discovers
some
overestimates
of
demand
and
in
january
1959,
the
proposal
is
revised
to
take
these
overestimates
into
account.
but
also
in
january
1959,
the
president
of
pennsalt
has
indicated
in
the
district
judges'
opinion,
page
828
of
the
record,
mr.
drake
accidentally
met
mr.
logan
of
olin
mathieson
and
the
two
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
at
that
time
the
proposal
for
independent
entry
was
put
on
ice,
pending
for
the
discussion
of
the
joint
venture.
again,
we
are
told
by
the
district
judges'
opinion
that
as
of
november
1959,
independent
construction
by
olin
at
page
816
appeared
to
be
definitely
more
of
a
possibility
that
it
had
been.
but
again,
a
curtain
descends
and
the
joint
venture
itself
is
shortly
entered
into.
in
fact,
neither
of
the
proposals,
the
pennsalt
plan
of
january
1959,
the
olin
plan
of
november
1959
for
independent
entry,
neither
proposal
was
rejected.
in
fact,
both
proposals
represented
the
culmination
of
long
sustained
efforts.
in
fact
both
appeared
to
make
economic
sense.
but
the
district
court
states
that
neither
proposal
had
in
fact
been
presented
to
top
management.
moreover,
we
are
told
on
page
823
of
the
record
the
following,
even
if
the
olin
proposal
had
been
presented
to
top
management,
no
intelligent
forecast
can
be
made
as
to
the
likelihood
of
its
approval
by
the
board
of
directors
who
had
the
final
say.
only
two
of
the
15
members
of
the
board
were
officers
of
olin.
the
names
of
some
of
the
other
members
marked
them
as
man
of
broad
financial
and
business
experience,
whether
these
men
were
hypercritical
or
easily
persuaded
to
accept
management
proposals
is
not
disclosed.
they're
record
in
approving
or
disapproving
such
proposals
is
not
revealed.
what
their
views
would
have
been
about
a
wholly
owned
chlorate
facility
cannot
be
conjectured.
we
disagree
that
an
intelligent
forecast
cannot
be
made
without
this
detailed
analysis
of
the
preferences
of
each
individual
member
of
the
board
but
we
agree
or
we
argue
that
an
intelligent
forecast
cannot
be
made
by
a
standard
that
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
evidence
of
managerial
reaction
to
independent
entry
at
a
particular
hour
and
date
and
ignores
the
economic
circumstances
in
which
the
company
finds
it
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
did
not,
the
government
believe
that
the
record
that
it
had
previously
made
and
which
this
court
had
previously
reviewed
had
not
been
rebutted
by
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe
that
this
opinion
reflects
the
district
court's
almost
complete
overlooking
at
this
point
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
firms
found
themselves
in
their
market.
it
concentrates
almost
exclusively
on
what
went
on
within
particular
divisions
and
within
the
boardroom.
we
also
argue
that
a
intelligent
evaluation
cannot
be
made
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
managerial
reaction
to
independent
entry
at
the
time
when
management
is
in
fact
evaluating
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
and
we
note
in
this
case
that
ever
since
1958,
the
two
companies
had
been
consulting
with
one
another
on
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture.
we
also
note
that
we
cannot
meet
the
court's
requirement
of
having
top
management
even
consider
the
proposal
when
it
is
the
very
fact
of
the
joint
venture
that
leads
top
management
to
ignore
the
proposal.
hence,
we
are
here
to
argue
that
the
standard
for
an
evaluation
of
whether
a
company
was
a
probable
entrant
cannot
be
the
standard
that
the
district
court
applied.
secondly,
we
shall
argue
that
under
an
appropriate
standard
applied
to
this
case,
the
government
has
proved,
at
least,
that
either
pennsalt
or
olin
would
have
entered
and
that
the
other
would
remain
a
significant
potential
competitor.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
there
are
some
findings
which
are
clearly
erroneous,
we
note
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
--
true,
depending
on
how
they
are
interpreted,
but
it's
very
hard
to
get
to
the
question
of
clearly
erroneous
when
the
standard
by
which
the
findings
are
made
is
erroneous.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
a
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
located
--
after
it
launched
is
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
one
is
if
the
court
was
assessed
--
asserting
that
the
so-called
investment
minimum
had
not
been
met,
that
was
clearly
erroneous.
now
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
if
we
persuade
you
that
under
a
proper
standard,
there
would
have
been
actual
entry
and
potential
competition
remaining
at
the
edge
of
the
market.
we
believed
that
this
court
can,
if
it
so
desires,
dispose
of
the
case
at
this
time
although
we
also
recognized
that
ordinarily,
you
were
to
remand
the
case
for
a
finding
of
violation
on
the
basis
of
a
proper
standard
of
entry.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
what
should
be
a
proper
standard
for
determining
entry.
i
should
like
to
start
by
referring
to
two
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
in
order
to
demonstrate
where
our
standard
that
we
proposed
comes
from.
i
refer
you
first
to
your
decision
in
this
case
378
u.s.
at
page
175.
after
reviewing
several
factors
concerning
the
market
structure
in
which
these
two
companies
operated,
concerning
their
capabilities,
concerning
their
interest,
this
court
said,
“unless
we
are
going
to
require
subjective
evidence,
this
array
of
probability
certainly
reaches
the
prima
facie
stage.”
as
we
have
indicated,
to
require
more
would
be
to
read
the
statutory
requirement
of
reasonable
probability
into
a
requirement
of
certainty.
this
we
will
not
do.
secondly,
recently
this
court
had
occasioned
to
address
itself
again
to
the
question
of
probable
entry
in
procter
&
gamble.
and
at
386
u.s.
and
580,
referring
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
potential
competition
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
management's
decision
to
enter
independently
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
an
actual
attempt
to
enter.
this
court
reached
the
conclusion
of
procter
&
gamble
was
the
most
likely
potential
entrant
from
evidence
as
to
procter's
activity
in
the
industry,
activity
is
similar
to
the
liquid
bleach
product,
procter's
program
of
diversifying
the
natural
avenue
of
expansion
represented
by
procter's
ability
to
use
similar
distribution
methods,
and
procter's
capabilities,
resources
and
special
advantages.
this
court
in
fact,
in
effect
i
believe,
looked
at
objective
economic
criteria
not
at
the
specifics
of
subjective
managerial
reactions
at
a
particular
time
and
place
to
make
an
overall
evaluation.
now
from
these
two
cases,
we
suggest
that
a
useful
rule
and
a
rule
which
would
lead
to
predictable
accuracy
would
be
as
follows.
first,
we
would
ask
does
the
company
have
the
capabilities
of
entering.
by
that
i
mean
does
it
have
the
technology,
the
know-how,
the
financial
resources.
if
it
does,
i
believe
it
is
at
least
a
possible
entry,
but
not
necessarily
a
probable
entrant.
the
second
question
is
designed
to
isolate
those
of
the
possible
entrants,
which
are
probable
entrants,
and
there
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
why
would
this
company
at
this
time
commit
its
resources
in
this
direction
rather
than
that
direction.
there,
there
are
a
variety
of
considerations
which
some
into
play
and
bearing
on
the
question
of
special
incentive.
as
in
procter
&
gamble,
it
might
be
that
the
new
market
is
in
the
area
of
the
natural
expansion
of
the
company
because
of
the
interrelationship
of
the
new
market
to
the
current
market.
or
again
as
in
procter
&
gamble,
the
company
may
enjoy
some
special
advantages
which
would
make
the
new
market
particularly
attractive
to
it
and
would
give
a
promise
of
the
good
profit
margin.or
indications
of
special
interest
may
be
reflected
by
sustained
and
intense
examination
of
this
particular
market
by
the
company.
and
in
the
case
such
as
this
where
in
fact
you
have
independent
entry,
i
don't
mean
independent
entry,
you
have
new
entry
via
a
joint
venture
and
the
commitment
of
three
and
three
quarter
million
dollars
by
each.
i
think
that
is
an
indication
that
this
is
not
just
another
possible
area
of
interest
that
the
companies
had
a
special
interest
in
this
market.
now,
the
virtues
of
the
test
that
we
proposed
is
combination
of
capabilities
and
special
incentive
or
that
it's
consonant
with
the
economic
forces
that
would
lead
to
predictions
which
the
economics
of
the
situation
would
lead
to.
it
would
not
have
any
particular
disincentive
effect
since
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
joint
venture
where
the
two
companies
cannot
individually
go
in,
that
would
be
taken
cared
of
by
the
capabilities
part
of
the
test.
thirdly,
it
avoids
the
vices
of
a
rule
such
as
used
by
the
court
below
where
there
is
virtually
exclusive
reliance
on
evidence
of
how
management
reacted
at
a
time
when
it
wasn't
focusing
on
independent
entry
without
having
before
it
the
prospect
of
joint
entry.
it
would
also
avoid
the
problem
of
evaluating
evidence
which
might
be
manufactured
to
avoid
antitrust
difficulties.
now
we
believe
that
such
a
test
was
implicitly
applied
by
this
court
to
this
case
the
last
time
this
case
was
here.
and
i
should
like
to
advert
again
to
this
court's
opinion
previously.
and
the
opinion
examined
the
evidence
then
before
the
court
and
this
court
stated,
the
evidence
shows
beyond
question
that
the
industry
was
rapidly
expanding,
the
relevant
southeast
market
was
important,
few
corporations
had
the
inclination,
resources,
and
know-how.
both
parents
of
penn-olin
had
great
resources,
each
had
long
been
identified
with
the
industry,
one
owned
a
valuable
patent
right
while
the
other
actually
engaged
in
sodium
chlorate
production.
each
had
other
chemicals
which
used
sodium
chlorate.
each
had
sustained
a
long
interest
in
entering
the
relevant
market
right
up
to
the
creation
of
the
joint
venture.
each
enjoyed
good
reputation
with
the
customers.
each
had
the
know-how
and
the
capacity.
each
could
have
done
so
at
a
reasonable
profit.
each
had
compelling
reasons.
pennsalt
needed
to
expand
its
sales.
olin
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
it
was
already
buying
sodium
chlorate,
and
that
it
was
promoting
a
process
for
using
it.
and
at
this
point
the
court
reached
the
conclusion,
unless
we
are
going
to
require
a
subjective
evidence,
this
array
of
probability
certainly
reaches
the
prima
facie
stage.
so
at
this
point
that
the
case
was
sent
back
for
further
evidence
on
the
question
whether
one
company
would
have
entered
and
one
company
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
market.
while
appellees
on
remand
put
in
additional
evidence
on
alleged
changes
in
the
market
after
the
joint
venture
took
place
and
cumulated
previous
testimony
as
to
managerial
thoughts
and
intentions,
the
basic
facts
reviewed
by
this
court
making
for
a
conclusion
of
probably
entry
are
unrebutted.
these
facts
were
found
by
the
district
court
in
its
first
decision.
penn
and
olin
each
had
the
resources
and
the
capabilities.
penn
was
one
of
the
very
few
actual
producers
of
sodium
chloride.
there
were
only
three
producers
of
this
commodity
in
the
country
at
that
time.
penn
was
--
pennsalt
was
one
of
them.
olin,
on
the
other
hand,
had
developed
a
process
of
its
own
for
the
production
of
pennsalt
--
of
sodium
chlorate
in
anticipation
of
entry
and
had
also
access
to
the
vickers-krebs
process.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
facts
on
the
record
in
this
case
which
i
believe
when
tested
by
a
proper
standard
compelled
a
conclusion
that
there
would
have
been
probable
entry
here.
these,
as
the
district
court
found
in
its
first
decision
comprised
the
following.
each
parent
had
ample
resources
and
capabilities
for
entering.
pennsalt
had
the
rare
actual
manufacturing
experience.
olin
had
a
substantially
developed
process
for
production
of
sodium
chlorate
of
its
own
and
in
addition
had
accessed
to
the
vickers-krebs
process.
olin
had
been
actually
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
sodium
chlorate
to
the
southeast
market,
to
the
pulp
customers
in
that
market.
pennsalt
had
marketing
experience
in
the
sale
of
sodium
chlorate
elsewhere
which
was
readily
transferable.
each
possessed
a
plant
site
at
which
a
factory
could
have
been
constructed.
each
had
financing
ability
to
construct
the
plant.
so
far
as
incentive
is
concerned,
the
market
itself
was
growing
rapidly.
it
was
highly
concentrated
with
two
companies
having
over
90%
of
the
business.
pennsalt,
a
producer
of
sodium
chlorate
could
develop
a
new
market
for
its
sodium
chlorate
and
for
other
chemicals.
olin,
because
of
its
work
in
installing
the
mathieson
process
which
was
the
most
commonly
used
bleaching
process
by
the
pulp
industry
possessed
ample
goodwill
and
ample
opportunity
to
sell
to
the
pulp
companies,
the
sodium
chlorate
they
needed
for
the
input
to
this
olin
mathieson
process.
finally,
there
has
been
a
longstanding
interest
on
the
part
of
both
companies
in
this
market.
there
had
been
indications
of
profitable
activity
possible.
and
finally,
we
have
indeed
here
the
fact
of
an
actual
investment
of
$7
and
a
half
million
at
a
10.1%
rate
of
return.
it
was
facts
such
as
these
that
i
think
this
court
applied
a
standard
similar
to
the
one
that
we
are
here
proposing
at
it
--
at
the
last
decision
and
which
led
this
court
to
believe
that
at
the
least
a
prima
facie
showing
had
been
made.
the
prima
facie
showing
has
not
rebutted
by
the
evidence
submitted
by
appellees.
the
evidence
submitted
by
appellees
largely
concerns
itself
with
developments
which
appeared
well
after
the
joint
venture
was
entered
into.
and
indeed,
i
believe
it
is
significant
that
the
district
judge
in
reaching
his
conclusion
that
there
was
no
probability
of
entry
does
not
rely
on
these
after
acquisition
events
for
his
conclusion.
the
principle
events
that
appellees
point
to,
they
urged
that
the
growth
and
demand
which
this
court
had
noted
as
a
significant
factor
in
explaining
the
incentive
for
entry
was
declining.
the
appellees
note
that
the
price
of
sodium
chlorate
was
declining.
and
the
appellees
note
that
there
was
a
threat
of
new
entry
from
the
pulp
and
paper
customers
and
the
appellees
would
argue
that
these
events
had
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
probable
entry
and
therefore
on
a
question
of
violation
in
this
case.
taking
first
the
question
of
price,
it
is
the
case
that
in
1964,
october
1964,
over
four
years
after
the
joint
venture
was
established
there
was
a
price
decline.
this
is
the
only
price
decline.
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
price
decline
four
years
after
the
fact
was
anticipated
at
the
time
the
joint
venture
was
entered
into.
it
would
therefore
have
no
bearing
on
whether
either
party
would
have
been
deterred
from
independent
entry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
look
at
page
551,
an
august
1960
document
at
the
very
time
of
the
inception
of
the
joint
venture,
where
we
have
a
request
for
appropriations
for
the
joint
venture
to
--
i
take
at
the
olin
management,
we
see
in
paragraph
three
the
following:
“in
view
of
the
stability
of
the
market
over
the
past
few
years,
we
anticipate
no
major
price
changes
during
the
next
five
years”.
now
that
was
the
state
of
mind
of
pennsalt
and
olin
at
the
time
they
entered
the
market.
they
were
not
anticipating
a
decline
of
price,
and
indeed
there
was
no
decline
in
price
until
four
years
later
which
they
freely
could
not
have
anticipated.
as
to
demand,
here
we'd
like
to
refer
to
the
appellee's
brief
where
in
appendix
2a,
on
page
2a,
they
have
provided
an
indication
of
what
happened
subsequently.
and
on
page
2a
we
find
that
the
production
in
the
market
in
1962
was
66,293
tons,
in
1963,
77,771
tons,
1964,
88,967
tons.
my
arithmetic
tells
me
that
this
represents
a
rate
of
growth
in
1962-1963,
i
believe
of
over
17%
and
on
1963-1964
of
over
14%.
now,
i
admit
that
there
is
a
decline
from
17%
to
14%,
but
nonetheless
the
testimony
indicated
that
the
usual
rate
of
growth
was
10%
at
the
time
of
the
joint
venture.
and
the
testimony
also
indicated
that
the
ordinary
rate
of
growth
in
the
chemical
industry
as
a
whole
is
5%
or
6%.
i
do
not
regard
this
as
indicating
any
radical
change
in
demand
which
could
have
been
anticipated
or
which
indeed
had
any
effect
on
the
question
of
entry
at
the
time
that
entry
occurred.
moreover
i
would
bring
the
court's
attention
to
same
table
in
1964,
the
hooker
chemical
company
which
was
one
of
the
established
entrants,
we
note
from
footnote
3
that
in
1964
it
has
further
capacity
under
construction.
so
that
we
scarcely
have
the
picture
here
of
a
market
which
has
suddenly
taken
a
radical
change
toward
diminution
and
decline.
the
third
major
factor
that
appellees
point
to
as
a
development
which
in
some
way
affected
the
question
of
entry
was
the
rise
of
the
threat
of
production
of
sodium
chlorate
by
the
pulp
and
paper
industry
itself.
and
indeed,
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
1964
price
drop
was
in
part
stimulated
by
threats
of
the
consumers
to
build
their
own
plants.
now
again,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
this
threat
was
a
lively
or
obvious
one
at
the
time
the
joint
venture
was
set
up.
that
it
would
have
deterred
either
pennsalt
or
olin
from
going
into
the
joint
venture.
and
indeed
the
best
inference
i
can
draw
from
this
development
is
that
it
was
the
highly
concentrated
nature
of
the
sodium
chlorate
market
that
forced
the
customers
to
seek
a
way
of
avoiding
this
high
and
stable
price
by
seeking
new
technology.
i
would
also
note
that
as
of
the
date
of
remand,
1965,
there
had
been
no
construction
of
plants
by
the
captive
producers
--
i'm
sorry,
by
the
captive
producers
i
mean
consumers
who
build
their
own
supplies.
so
that
even
if
this
began
to
emerged
as
a
factor,
it
would
have
been
emerging
in
the
mid-60's
and
could
not
have
had
any
effect
on
pennsalt
or
olin
at
the
time
that
they
were
making
their
decisions
to
enter
and
would
not
have
seriously
inhibited
their
continuing
concern
and
continuing
interest
in
the
market.
again,
i
point
out
that
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
these
after
the
acquisition
developments
for
its
findings
that
there
was
no
probability
of
entry.
it
simply
said
that
these
subsequent
developments
after
the
venture
make
it
even
less
likely
that
they
would
have
gone
in.
now,
i
would
also
wish
to
argue
that
not
only
would
one
of
the
firms
have
entered
under
the
test
as
we
understand
it
as
we
think
it
should
be
and
under
the
record
as
it
exist.
but
we
also
believe
that
the
entry
of
the
one
firm
would
not
have
deterred
the
remaining
firm
from
continuing
its
long
existent
interest
in
entering.
here
i
would
note
that
we
have
the
phenomenon
of
both
firms
knowing
for
several
years
that
each
was
considering
independent
entry
or
possible
joint
entry.
they
had
the
relationships
since
1958
where
they
would
advice
one
another
of
new
developments.
there
is
no
indication
in
any
of
their
thinking
at
that
point
that
they
said,
“well,
if
olin
beats
me,
i,
pennsalt
will
not
go
in”,
or
“if
pennsalt
beats
me,
i,
olin
would
not
go
in.”
we
don't
see
any
indication
of
that.
secondly,
as
i've
suggested,
this
market
has
continued
to
expand
and
even
after
the
entry
of
a
combined
penn-olin,
and
a
rather
larger
tonnage
than
was
anticipated
by
either
one,
we
find
that
the
pittsburg
plate
glass
company
was
not
deterred
from
entry
and
it
found
room
to
build
a
15,000-ton
capacity.
and
we
find
as
i
have
just
indicated
that
hooker
found
it
desirable
to
expand
its
capacity
in
1964.
i
think
this
suggests
that
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
mere
fact
that
actual
entry
by
one
would
have
upset
or
change
this
long-sustained
rational
interest
that
each
company
had
in
this
market.
i
would
rather
suspect
that
one
would
have
followed
the
other
in
shortly
thereafter,
but
that
isn't
necessary
for
our
case.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
mr.
justice
white,
there
were
no
decisions
not
to
go
in.
what
happened
here
is
you
have
some
projects
hang
in
fire
and
then
nothing
more
is
heard
from
them.
and
all
the
focus
on
attention
moves
on
to
the
joint
venture.
we
have
in
fact
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
decision
not
to
go
in.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
there
was
--
certainly
not
at
the
january
1959
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
yes,
but
that
was
the
district
court's
ultimate
conclusion.
but
the
district
court
did
not
find
decisions
not
to
go
in.
in
other
words
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
factual
finding
that
the
board
of
directors
sat
down
in
january
of
1959,
the
pennsalt
board
of
directors
and
looked
at
the
proposal
which
is
set
forth
on
page
730
of
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
on
the
fact
that
the
management
never
considered
these
proposals,
that
top
management
never
approved
these
proposals,
and
that
there's
no
way
of
predicting
that
top
management
would've
--
approved
it,
the
proposal.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
white
that
that
was
a
somewhat
harder
case,
but
i
would
still
suggest
that
even
there,
you
would
not
want
to
rely
solely
and
exclusively
on
such
a
decision.
and
that
you
would
have
to
give
some
attention
to
the
other
factors
to
which
i
refer
and
let
me
illustrate
why.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
for
this
reason
that
the
--
and
it
depends
on
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
same
decision.
if
you
are
referring
to
a
decision
not
to
go
in
made
at
a
time
when
the
board
of
directors
has
before
it,
the
prospects
of
the
joint
venture,
which
they
very
much
want,
i
would
suggest
that
their
decision
not
to
go
in
cannot
be
dispositive.
no,
i
do
not
say
that
it
does
not
have
considerable
significance,
but
it
should
not
be
dispositive.
we
have
seen
in
the
antitrust
field
other
situations
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that's
right,
i
would
slot
it
in.
but
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
we
will
know
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes
mr.
justice
white.
this
opinion
spends
virtually
no
time
at
all.
no
space
at
all
in
considering
pennsalt's
capacity
or
the
state
of
the
market
or
the
incentives
to
enter.
this
opinion
is
radically
different
from
the
findings
on
which
this
court
relied
earlier.
it's
confined
almost
solely
to
an
examination
of
proposals
and
responses.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
i
argue
that
we
cannot
give
that
conclusive
weight
but
it
goes
into
the
package
that
you
take
the
overall
array
of
considerations.
now
i
don't
think
there
is
apt
to
be
that
this
kind
of
great
disparity
between
what
is
economically
desirable
to
the
company
in
the
way
their
corporation
might
react
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
think
that
decisions
made
in
such
a
context
would
have
far
more
appropriative
weight
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
than
the
decisions
made
here.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
there
were
none
decisions
in
--
again,
there
were
no
--
and
the
problem
here
is
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
management
never
made
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
were
decisions
made
to
go
via
the
joint
venture
but
two
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
proposals
were
left
hanging
in
fire.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
certainly.
your
honor,
i
mean
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
inevitable
consequence
of
going
in
jointly
as
that
one
doesn't
go
in
alone.
yes,
i
am
suggesting
that
you
cannot
give
--
well,
in
the
situation
here,
in
the
situation
where
the
joint
venture
is
always
the
context
of
decision
making,
you
cannot
give
the
decision
to
go
into
the
joint
venture
rather
than
to
go
individually.
(inaudible)
cannot
say
that
therefore,
had
the
joint
venture
never
existed,
they
would
have
not
gone
in.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
when
this
case
was
last
here,
this
court
all
but
found
probable
entry
and
remanded
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
prima
facie
case
of
probable
entry
and
i
assumed
that
the
appellees
were
to
have
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
case.
i
would
suppose
that
what
i
am
suggesting
is
quite
consistent
with
what
this
court
have
previously
done.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
if
i
may
on
the
question
of
whether
assuming
that
i
have
persuaded
you
that
the
standard
for
entry
and
for
judging
entry
that
i
proposed
is
an
appropriate
one.
and
assuming
that
you
agree
with
me
that
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
one
would
have
gone
in
and
the
other
at
least
hovered,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
the
question
of
whether
this
would
constitute
a
violation
of
section
7.
and
in
this
regard
i
wish
to
note
very
briefly
that
you
have
here
a
very
highly
concentrated
industry
with
two
companies
having
over
90%
assuming
that
olin
or
penn
had
gone
in,
you
would've
had
three
companies
representing
100%
of
the
industry.
it
also
note
that
the
structure
of
the
industry
hasn't
changed
in
five
years.
i
would
urge
that
when
you
have
a
three-company
industry
and
--
but
when
you
have
as
you
have
here
but
very
few
potential
entrants
of
any
significance,
and
if
one
of
those
very
few
potential
entrants
of
any
significance
is
the
other
partner
here,
i
would
urge
that
the
result
of
the
joint
venture
was
to
remove
as
a
control
or
as
an
influence
on
the
market
one
of
the
very
few
influences
that
existed
and
that
this
would
be
a
basis
for
finding
a
violation
of
section
7.
now,
i
well
understand
that
there
has
--
there
have
not
been
findings
on
this
point
on
the
case
below.
we
have
analyzed
in
great
detail
the
evidence
that
has
been
put
in.
our
analysis
demonstrates
i
believe
that
at
most
there
were
two
or
three
potential
entrants
which
had
the
significance
and
vitality
under
olin
and
that
the
other
chemical
companies
were
distinguishable
because
they
had
no
experience
in
producing
sodium
chlorate.
they
had
no
experience
in
selling
sodium
chlorate.
they
had
no
plant
sites.
they
had
no
record
of
similar
sustained
interest
which
has
been
going
on
in
this
case
for
years
on
behalf
of
these
two
companies.
and
unlike
these
two
companies,
they
did
not
in
fact
invest
substantial
sums
of
money
in
this
business.
i
therefore
think
there
was
a
small
group
of
potential
entrants
and
olin
for
--
of
that
group,
the
joint
venture
has
deprived
this
market
of
the
competition
that
that
potential
entry
could
well
have
provided.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
if
there
were
a
remand
for
determination
of
the
question
of
violation
and
if
there
were
a
full-pledge
hearing
on
whether
there
would
be
distinguishable
factors
between
penn
and
olin
has
potential
entrants
and
others,
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
be
all
advised
not
to
put
more
evidence
in
but
i
think
we
have
made
our
case
now.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
would
suppose
that
we
would
be
sending
it
back
for
appropriate
relief,
the
relief
we
had
asked
for
dissolution
of
the
joint
venture
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
which
would
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
brennan
i
would
be
quite
happy
if
we
understand
and
if
we
developed
a
proper
standard
for
entry
and
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate
to
send
the
case
back
to
see
how
that
standard
works.
however,
this
case
has
been
here
before.
we
have
had
a
very
full
provision
of
evidence,
the
appellees
put
in
all
their
evidence
on
the
question
of
violation.
i
think
this
court
could
well
dispose
of
this
case
now
and
that
would
make
me
happier
still.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
but
we
make
it
clear
that
we
understand
that
this
is
not
a
normal
procedure
of
this
court.
we
simply
suggest
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
case
in
which
not
to
remand
for
further
trial.
we've
had
seven
years
now.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice
i'd
like
to
comment
on
several
--
of
the
points
made.
it
seems
to
me
that
appellees
cannot
argue
simultaneously
that
we're
dealing
with
the
market
surrounded
by
a
host
of
possible
entrants,
namely
the
rest
of
the
chlor-alkali
industry,
always
on
the
edge
--
always
exercising
influence
on
the
price
in
the
market.
and
at
the
same
time
argue
that
the
captive
producers'
threat
of
emergence
in
1964
led
to
a
price
break.
clearly,
if
you
have
a
market
of
actual
and
potential
competitors
consisting
of
some
13
or
15
companies
which
is
what
i
understand
the
appellees
to
argue,
i
would
assume
that
the
market
price
must
be
somewhere
near
a
competitive
level
and
it
would
not
require
a
threat
of
rebellion
by
the
consumers
to
lead
finally
to
a
price
reduction.
i
think
the
significant
threat,
if
there
were
one,
emerged
in
1964
or
in
1965,
the
other
chemical
companies
were
not
regarded
and
did
not
have
the
effect
on
the
market
that
is
claimed
beforehand,
else
we
would
not
see
the
phenomenon
of
the
price
break
in
response
to
the
threat
of
the
consumer.
now,
if
what
we
have
here
is
the
emergence,
three
or
four
years
after
the
joint
venture,
of
a
reaction
by
the
consumer
which
indeed
does
for
the
first
time
placed
a
restraint
on
the
ability
of
the
members
of
this
highly
concentrated
market
to
maintain
an
absolutely
stable
price,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
joint
venture
was
not
a
violation
at
the
time
it
was
consummated.
the
argument
in
effect,
i
believe
that
appellees
are
making,
is
that
if
you
have
a
joint
venture
which
maintains
a
tightly
concentrated
industry
and
if
as
a
result
there
is
an
absolute
stability
of
prices
so
that
consumers
finally
search
out
other
devices,
and
if
four
years
later,
the
sellers
respond
to
this
new
threat
by
lowering
their
prices,
the
joint
venture
is
in
some
sense
legitimatize
retroactively.
this
i
think
cannot
be
a
theory
that
this
court
can
abide.
now
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
there
would
be
an
enhancement
of
competition,
we
must
note
that
when
we
are
speaking
about
the
question
of
violation
we
are
assuming
the
entry
of
one
firm
and
the
continued
presence
on
the
edge
of
the
market
of
another.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
single
olin
or
a
single
pennsalt
could
not
have
competed
effectively
and
in
a
market
as
highly
concentrated
as
this,
i
think
it
is
peculiarly
important
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
a
second
firm
which
might
have
threatened
to
enter
through
new
technology
and
indeed
which
might
have
ultimately
entered.
i
should
think
that
this
would
be
a
great
contribution
to
competition.
i
would
also
like
to
note
that
mr.
delone
misreads
the
significance
of
note
18
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
what
we
were
contending
against
was
the
court's
finding
that
pennsalt's
process
was
in
some
sense
superior
to
olin's
process.
we
were
not
contending
that
the
possession
of
a
process
for
making
sodium
chlorate
was
not
significant.
we
were
saying
each
of
these
were
uniquely
situated
and
that
they
had
processes,
and
in
this
respect
they
were
significantly
different
than
the
other
members
of
this
industry.
finally,
i
should
like
to
note
with
respect
to
the
assertions
that
there
was
something
magical
about
the
investment
rate
of
return
that
explained
the
reluctance
of
pennsalt
to
go
forward
with
its
project
or
the
reluctance
of
olin
to
go
forward
with
the
october
or
november
1959
project,
the
argument
asserted
is
that
--
but
for
the
joint
venture
there
could
be
no
borrowing.
without
borrowing
there
could
be
no
leverage
effect.
without
leverage
effect
there
could
be
no
substantial
profit.
this
simply
is
not
the
case
and
the
court
does
not
so
claim,
and
the
record
disputes
it.
if
the
court
found
on
page
834
that
the
court's
estimate
in
pennsalt
indicated
a
rate
of
return
of
26.2%
without
borrowing
and
then
in
footnote
28
with
50%
of
the
capital
borrowing
--
borrowed
the
combined
project
gave
a
rate
of
return
of
42.7%.
and
if
you
look
at
supporting
documents,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
combined
--
that
the
borrowing
was
to
be
by
pennsalt
alone
and
this
is
at
the
time
when
commutations
were
made
for
a
pennsalt
only
project.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
pennsalt
from
borrowing
and
getting
the
leverage
effect.
there's
nothing
that
prevent
olin
from
borrowing,
from
getting
the
leverage
effect.
and
in
fact
the
nub
of
the
matter
is
that
they
went
forward
with
the
transaction
without
borrowing.
and
they
went
forward
at
a
time
when
they
knew
they
were
walking
into
antitrust
problems
and
when
they
--
would
know
that
if
borrowing
were
the
key
elements
that
they
would
think
twice
about
the
transaction.
that's
all
i
have.
