mr.
justin
r.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
justin
wolf.
i
appear
here
today
in
behalf
of
standard
oil
company
of
texas,
to
argue
the
single
point
that
we
have
raised
in
our
very
short
brief,
the
point
that
we
have
persistently
raised
before
the
commission
on
rehearing
and
before
the
court
of
appeals.
assuming
the
propriety
of
familiar
rate
base,
cost
of
service,
methods
for
prescribing
the
rate
for
new
gas-well
gas
on
an
industry
basis
in
the
permian
basin
area.
it
is
our
contention
if
the
commission
has
committed
a
grievous,
serious
error
in
it's
computation
of
that
cost
of
service
and
error
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
utility
regulation
and
cost
of
service
specifically.
they
have
allowed
an
earning
of
their
allowed
12%
return
--
rate
of
return
on
a
rate
base
that
is
equal
to
a
little
more
than
half
of
what
the
commission
has
found
is
the
industry's
prudent
investment
in
the
production
of
new
gas-well
gas
specifically.
they
have
allowed
a
12%
return
on
a
rate
base
of
43.45
cents
where
they
had
found
that
the
prudent
investment
rate
base
of
the
industry
is
79
cents.
the
error
of
the
commission
really
amounts
to
saying
that
it
would
be
proper
for
any
regulated
industry
to
charge
rate
certificate
to
be
permitted
to
be
char
--
to
charge
rates
which
would
not
yield
the
required
reasonable
rate
of
return
during
the
first
period
of
a
capital
recovery
period
in
this
instance
a
hypothetical
20
years.
in
anticipation
of
the
regulated
industry
at
the
same
rates
will
recover
or
earn
an
excessive
rate
of
return
during
the
last
half
of
that
capital
recovery
period,
in
this
instance,
the
last
10
years.
we
submit
that
this
is
fundamentally
in
conflict
with
the
utility
law
that
has
been
developed
by
this
court
at
least
beginning
in
bluefield
in
262,
in
los
angeles
gas
electric
in
289
u.s.,
and
the
west
ohio
case
in
294
and
indeed
is
a
hypothesis
rejected
by
the
commission
itself
in
its
south
carolina
generating
case
and
decision
in
16,
federal
power
commission
reports,
page
52.
moreover,
the
cost
of
the
natural
gas
producing
industry
is
--
it
has
been
an
aggressive,
dynamic
one
which
regulates
year-in,
year-out,
invest
large
new
sums
to
find
and
develop
new
reserves
to
meet
a
constantly
increasing
market
demands
to
which
reference
has
made
--
inlaid
before
you
today.
that
natural
gas
producing
industry
will
never,
in
the
foreseeable
future,
reach
a
state
of
50%
equation
of
its
new
gas-well
gas
reserves.
yet,
under
the
commission's
formula,
the
gas
producing
industry
must
reach
a
stage
of
50%
depletion
before
it
can
begin
to
recruit
its
earned
--
it's
under
earnings
through
alleged
accessories.
the
commission
treats
each
79
cent
capital
investment
to
which
it
refers
in
its
opinion
as
if
it
were
a
single
asset
and
as
if
it
were
the
only
asset
of
the
gas
producing
industry.
the
fact
is
that
each
year
the
industry
has
a
constantly
changing
and
a
constantly
expanding
package
of
assets.
as
of
the
test
year
in
1960,
there
were
some
depleted
properties,
some
brand
new
ones.
others
come
all.
in
the
foreseeable
future,
the
totality
of
the
package
that
is
what
the
industry
has,
is
a
package
of
gas,
new
gas-well
gas
producing
assets.
in
the
foreseeable
future
the
package
will
never
reach
a
stage
of
50%
depletion.
both
the
commission
and
the
courts,
particularly
the
fifth
circuit,
have
recognized
that
in
a
growing,
expanding
industry,
you
cannot,
do
not
in
the
foreseeable
future,
reach
a
stage
of
50%
efficient
or
50%
depreciation.
when
i
say
that
the
commission
has
recognized
this,
i
refer
to
the
relatively
recent
opinion
in
the
alabama,
tennessee
case
at
31,
federal
power
commission
reports,
and
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
affirming
the
commission's
decision
reporting
in
359
f.2d.--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
--
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
in
87
supreme
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
the
commission?
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
in
view
--
in
applying
the
rate
base?
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
the
alternative
--
one
alternative
would
be,
if
this
court
feels
it
appropriate
to
direct
to
the
commission
to
pick
and
choose
between
the
alternatives
but
since
you're
not
asking
me
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
(inaudible)
you're
asking
the
part
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
they
could
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
the
commission
could
readily
have
employed
a
cross
section
of
packages
of
gas
if
you
will,
of
investments
found
or
made
over
a
relatively
recent
period
or
more
precisely
struck
an
average
of
all
new
gas-well
gas
that
was
flowing
in
1967.
remember
by
definition
that
all
new
gas-well
gas
of
all
new
gas-well
gas
is
gas
flowing
under
contracts
executed
after
january
1,
1961.
now,
they
could
have
taken
gas
discovered
in
1960,
gas
discovered
in
1961,
gas
discovered
in
1962,
etcetera
to
a
reasonable
period.
let's
say
through
1964,
since
they
wrote
their
opinion
in
september
of
1965,
they
could've
taken
those
packages,
reduced
the
gross
investment
of
each
by
the
period
of
depletion
of
each.
they
could
have
struck
an
average,
determined
an
average
rate
base,
and
apply
their
12%
for
that.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes
sir.
because
what
they
did
was
to
assume
one
package,
one
asset,
one
79
cent
investment.
you
see,
mr.
justice
fortas,
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
--
if
you
do
it
my
way
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
am
not.
i
am
saying
that
applying
the
method
that
they
used
of
these
79
cents
of
--
in
--
of
prudent
investment
in
finding
new
gas-well
gas,
what
they
did
was
to
apply
the
12%
rate
of
return
to
a
rate
base
that's
roughly
half.
i
am
saying
that's
wrong
because
the
industry
will
never
reach
that
stage
of
depletion,
i.e.50%
depletion
that
would
permit
it
in
the
latter
years
of
12%
times
43.45
who
have
excess
earnings
when
we
know
that
in
the
earlier
years
at
12%
times
43.45,
they're
going
to
have
under
earnings.
i'm
saying
they
could've
avoided
that.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
oh,
no
sir.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
--
that
their
79
cents
is
--
that
(inaudible)
the
record
for
their
43.45.
i
am
clearly
criticizing
if
i
may
for
one
moment
to
answer
the
question
i'm
clearly
criticizing,
what
they
have
done
with
the
data
that
they
have
used
in
the
matter
of
which
i
have
described.
thank
you,
your
