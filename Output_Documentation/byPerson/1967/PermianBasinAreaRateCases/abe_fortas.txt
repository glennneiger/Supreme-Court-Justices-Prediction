rejection
of
what,
mr.
solomon?
justice

fortas
when
you
say
distributors,
you
mean
the
pipeline
companies?
justice
abe
fortas
whom
do
you
then?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
when
you've
been
talking
about
distributors
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
producer
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solomon,
when
you
talked
about
directionality,
you
mean
prospecting,
directed
to
the
discovery
of
gas-wells
as
distinguished
from
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
in
this
--
can
you
tell
what
the
–
a
producer
or
prospector
is
going
for?
in
other
words,
does
the
technique
used
to
prospect
for
gas
is
so
different
from
the
technique
used
to
prospect
for
oil,
if
you
can
tell
which
names
the
outcome,
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
the
subject
of
the
facts
here.
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
information
that
was
collected
confined
to
the
permian
basin,
these
questionnaires
you're
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
only
matched?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
conclusions
here
are
based
on
national
data?
justice
abe
fortas
before
we
get
to
that,
mr.
solomon,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
you
just
said
that
the
commission
arrived
a
cost
of
gas-well
gas
and
then
trended
that
back
to
find
the
cost
for
old
well
gas
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
old
gas-well
gas,
and
the
--
then
took
that
figure
and
used
that
as
the
basis
for
costing
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
gas
in
association
with
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
in
other
words,
that
the
--
let
me
make
sure,
that
the
oil-well
gas
was
priced
by
reference
to
the
old
gas-well
gas.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
have
i
got
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we're
going
to
say
--
and
then
say
12%
rate
of
returns
which
you
have
talked
about,
are
you
going
to
elaborate
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
the
12%
rate
of
return,
or
was
that
a
private
--
is
that
applied
across
the
board
to
all
producers?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
was
not
especially
calibrated
being
a
small
producer?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
what
percentage
of
the
--
totaled
out
for
the
--
in
the
permian
basin
to
distribute
it
to
small
producers
as
you
define
small
producers.
you
said
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
a
12
--
that
the
12%
figure
as
a
rate
of
return
was
determined
by
the
commission
because
of
the
problem
of
the
small
producers?
justice
abe
fortas
you
were
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
everybody
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
everybody
gets
such
a
nice,
good,
fat
rate
of
return
that
small
producers
aren't
--
not
to
complain
despite
the
possibility
that
they
may
have
a
special
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that.
well,
i
have
a
difficulty
in
reading
the
material,
the
–
in
understanding
here
in
--
that
there
was
any
special
relationship
between
the
12%
rate
of
return
and
the
special
problem,
if
one
exists
with
the
small
producers.
and
to
what
you've
said
now,
i
gather
that
this
is
not
the
same
that
the
12%
whole
rate
of
return
overall
are
to
take
care
of
the
smaller
producers
as
well
as
everybody
else.
justice
abe
fortas
will
significantly
affect
what?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
conservation
interests
involved
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
the
commission
takes
that
into
account
on
abandonment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
they'll
conduct
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
will
continue
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
–
as
the
price
fix
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
the
fact
that
this
is
a
natural
resource
of
--
that
there
are
conservation
values
involved
here
give
you
any
comfort
with
respect
to
supporting
this
price
regulation.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
remember
any
reference
to
the
special
impact,
if
any,
that
in
fact,
that
this
natural
resource
may
have
upon
the
legal
issues
to
some
of
the
cases,
how
much
you
rely.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
about
--
what
is
the
range
of
variation
in
the
contract
price
now
in
the
permian
basin?
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
no,
let's
take
a
contract
negotiation
in
a
short
range
of
time.
well,
let's
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
there's
so
much
variation
within
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
take
contracts
that
are
negotiated
within
the
10-day
or
30-day
period
of
time,
is
there
much
of
a
range
in
the
price
term
of
those
contracts?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
in
the
negotiation
of
contracts
at
a
particular
point
of
time,
the
individual
situation
determines
price,
whether
the
price
is
determined
by
the
clustering
of
the
marketplace.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
do
take
--
do
you
take
the
position
on
where
the
contract
price
is
higher
than
the
--
merely
price
--
the
contract
price
suggested
value?
justice
abe
fortas
but
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
two
as
a
legal
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps,
i
don't
understand
this.
but
i'm
going
to
ask
you
this
question.
a
producer
in
the
permian
basin
has
a
contract
10
years
ago
for
the
sale
of
gas
at
a
price
that
is
lower
than
your
area
rate.
the
producer
with
the
consent
of
the
company
purchasing
from
that
producer
comes
to
the
commission
and
says
that,
“i
want
to
raise
my
--
this
contract
price”,
do
you
or
do
you
not
permit
that
or
do
you
prohibit
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
escalation.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
escalations.
they
want
to
bring
it
up
to
the
rate
that
–
as
described
in
your
schedule?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
they
come
in
and
say
it
doesn't
–
it's
not
written
into
this
contract
where
originally
entered
into
but
we
agree
now
that
the
rate
be
raised,
the
producer
and
the
purchaser,
and
with
your
schedule
from
the
pricing
system
here
prohibit
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
your
position
is
that
your
escape
clause
is
broad
enough
so
that
somebody
thinks
that
confiscatory
result
has
been
occasioned
by
a
preexisting
application.
can
come
in
and
seek
relief
or
he
can
file
or
(inaudible)
and
start
and
take
off
a
proceeding
that
way
which
presumably
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so,
or
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
commission's
order
does
not
commit
the
commission
on
granting
relief
in
those
circumstances
but
you
would
say
that
it
has
power
to
do
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals,
i
suppose
on
the
criticisms
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
was
that
you
--
the
commission
did
not
commit
itself
to
give
relief
in
these
hypothetical
con
--
in
situations
of
individually
confiscatory
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
it
–
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
me
generally
whether
it's
shows
a
higher
or
a
lower
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
excuse
me
sir,
what
percentage
if
you
can
give
us
an
idea,
what
percentage
of
the
cost
figure
here
is
represented
by
exploration
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
30%?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
beg
your
pardon?
what
is
that
1.1
cents?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
against
the
4
point
something
cents.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
i
understand
your
position
that
–
should
at
least
say
it
this
way
that
you're
saying
that
1
--
only
1.1
cents
out
of
this
4
point
something
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
standards
and
beyond
that,
there
is
an
allowance
made
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
(inaudible)?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
see,
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
is
that
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
remainder
is
the
replacement
of
the
price,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
spending
stock
as
preserved
presented
so
to
speak.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
the
average,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
about
the
extreme
or
to
say
that
very
high
cost
producer.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
another
question,
i
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
most
figures,
you
don't
like
the
idea.
justice
abe
fortas
well
how
did
your
largest
customer
range
for
that
gas?
is
it
somewhat
--
it's
a
pipeline
more
than
el
paso?
justice
abe
fortas
the
matter
what
–
made
that
way
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
there
--
mr.
merrill,
was
there
also
a
change
in
the
underlying
facts
that
is
to
say,
when
did
the
directional
technique
of
--
for
finding
gas
oil
--
gas
oils
of
--
become
an
important
factor
in
the
industry?
i
don't
know,
let's
review
our
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
you
ask
that
(voice
overlap)
--
you
heard
the
argument
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i
suppose
--
let's
supposed
there
did
come
a
point
of
time
that
would
show
--
let
us
say
a
majority
of
the
gas
that
were
sold
was
a
gas-well
gas,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
can
you
approximate
that
point
of
time
for
us?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
this
have
happened
after
the
statement
made
by
the
commission
on
the
second
phillips
case?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
let
me
just
state
to
you
what's
running
through
my
mind.
i
don't
know
whether
its
sound.
but
what's
running
through
my
mind
is
that
the
impression
of
the
argument
--
from
the
argument
yesterday
that
there
came
a
point
of
time
when
gas-well
gas
became
a
predominant
importance
in
the
industry.
and
the
possibility
that
because
of
that
change
in
the
characteristics
of
the
industry,
a
quotation
that
you
just
read
from
the
commission's
second
philips
case
may
not
have
had
the
same
opinion,
say
in
the
same
thrust
that
it
had
at
the
time
that
the
commission
wrote
that.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
opposing
contentions
bear
in
my
mind
and
if
i
correctly
understand
the
situation,
perhaps
very
likelihood
i
don't.
at
a
time
when
the
industry
was
dominated
by
gas
that
was
produced
jointly
with
oil,
say,
the
commission
made
the
--
that
at
that
time,
the
commission
said
that
the
use
of
a
cost
data
is
not
feasible
because
of
the
necessarily
arbitrary
characteristics
of
allocating
joint
cost.
then
there
came
a
point
of
time
when
it
was
not
gas
and
association
with
oil
but
gas
that
had
been
produced
more
or
less
independently
of
oil.
at
that
became
dominant
in
the
industry
and
the
question
that
the
arguments
today
and
what
you've
said
here
raised
in
my
mind
is
whether
that
may
have
made
a
difference
in
the
logic
of
the
commission
statement
in
the
second
phillips.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
merrill,
is
there
a
different
--
a
legal
distinction
between
the
commission's
job
and
the
job
of
their
reviewing
forth
with
respect
to
this
consideration?
that
is
to
say,
you
argue
and
i
think
understand
it,
that
an
incentive
--
price
incentive
has
to
be
provided
in
the
rate
structure
in
the
national
intrastate,
i
quite
understand
that
i
think.
the
question
is
does
a
--
does
that
consideration
apply
with
the
same
vigor
in
terms
of
the
reviewing
court's
function
as
it
does
in
terms
of
the
administrative
agency,
that
is
to
say
are
franchises
not
total
that
completes
franchise?
what
your
--
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(inaudible)
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
are
different
matters.
and
i
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
talking
to
you
about
this
matter
providing
an
incentive
for
exploration.
well,
do
you
derive
that
from
the
constitutional
provision
or
from
something
in
the
statute
or
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
is
the
judicially
and
forcible
duty
of
the
commission
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
--
(inaudible)
is
to
what
is
there
--
what
specific
provision
on
the
constitution
or
what
specific
provision
in
the
statute?
do
you
rely
upon
to
say
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
court's
to
require
not
only
that
the
commission
pay
or
what
justice
jackson,
that
the
commission
provide
payment
for
a
cost
of
producing
the
gas
but
also
that
the
commission
provide
rates
that
will
give
an
incentive
for
exploration,
kind
of
distinction
that
mr.
justice
jackson
made
the
--
in
that
quotation
that
you
read.
that's
what
i'm
asking
about.
what
is
the
specific
provision
of
law
on
which
you
rely
with
respect
from
the
question
of
public
--
imperative
public
policy?
justice
abe
fortas
but
general,
do
i
understand
that
you're
not
attacking
the
rates
fixed
by
the
federal
power
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
your
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
mattered
but,
are
you
urging
that
the
states
are
prejudiced
by
the
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
how
so?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean
to
say
if
you
do
--
if
you
are
--
not,
if
you
don't
take
the
position
that
these
rates
are
fixed
so
as
to
injure
the
conservation
interest
of
the
state,
how
is
the
state
prejudiced
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
but
why
did
you
take
the
9.5%,
the
preparation
of
the
exhibit
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
initially?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
where
did
the
9.5%
figure
come
from?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
object
to
the
9.5%?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
this
rate
is
confiscatory
as
to
the
hunt
oil
company
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
record
contains
evidence
to
demonstrate
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
percentage
if
you
can
tell
me,
as
your
cost
as
shown
with
--
related
to
exploration?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
however
that
may
be,
is
it
your
position
that
to
determine
the
(inaudible)
the
lower
rates
confiscatory
that
your
coal
exploration
cost
has
to
be
taken
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
constitutional
question.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
asking
it
to
you
for
your
--
i'm
asking
about
it
because
of
its
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
it
should
be
some.
that
would
be
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
fine.
now,
on
a
reasonable
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
question
is
that
the
industry
average
is
4%
and
the
history
shows
that
the
volume
and
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
history
shows
that
the
volume
has
been
that
has
been
sold
--
has
been
replaced,
is
it
--
would
it
still
be
your
position
that
hunt
oil
should
be
allowed
to
call
such
a
percent?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you'd
have
to
discount
this
cost
on
that
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
say
that
perhaps,
can
you
tell
me,
if
you
took
only
the
fair
return,
whatever
that
might
be
on
the
amount
of
your
investment
in
the
existing
oil
wells
and
your
operating
expenses
excluding
exploration,
would
the
results
still
be
confiscatory
as
to
hunt
oil
company
under
these
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
a
small
independent
producer,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
still
--
you
say
that
excluding
all
cost
for
exploration
that
a
rate
of
return
--
fair
rate
of
return
on
the
investment,
i
won't
ask
you
what
that
is,
plus
your
our
of
pocket
operating
expenses,
if
these
rates,
you
would
not
be
covering
those
two
items?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
for
the
moment,
yes
sir
because
that's
what
i
understood
you
argue
in
your
last
statement
i
--
to
the
time
you
made
which
i'm
sorry
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
we're
talking
only
about
permian
basin.
it's
not
covered
for
us
at
the
moment.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
think
i
follow
on
this
but
i
hate
to
take
more
of
your
time,
the
problem
that
perplexes
me
in
this
field
is,
how
you
can
really
be
in
anywhere
with
respect
to
the
confiscation
argument
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
exploration
cost
here
are
absolutely
with
--
are
almost
absolutely
within
the
control
of
the
producer.
now
this
to
say
that
the
argument
assumes
that
the
--
that
if
a
producer
at
all
--
if
the
argument
assumes
that
all
a
producer's
exploration
cost
are
properly
part
of
the
cost
base
for
purposes
of
confiscation,
then
if
a
producer
can
go
out
and
--
to
enlarge
his
own
supply
and
spend
all
the
money
that
he
can
beg
or
borrow
for
exploration
just
to
enlarge
his
own
position
in
the
industry
and
his
own
share
of
market
and
that
--
all
of
that
cost
would
go
to
this
cost
base
and
he'll
use
it
for
purposes
of
measuring
confiscation
and
that's
a
concept
that
--
does
not
at
all
like
the
usual
thing
that
lawyer
encounters
in
this
or
--
with
the
respect
to
the
constitutional
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
my
question
to
you
is,
does
this
record
with
respect
to
your
client
--
does
this
record
contain
information
sufficiently
specific
individualized
and
precise
so
as
to
permit
a
judgment
on
that
point
either
in
terms
of
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
or
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
proof.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
about
including
the
offer
of
--
any
offer
of
proof
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
they
should
be
compensated
for
that
cost,
you
mean
that
they
ought
to
be
a
rate
plus
something
else
fixed
by
the
commission
or
do
you
mean
--
or
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
error
in
the
failure
to
include
this
in
cost
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i'm
asking
you
which
--
for
which
position
are
you
contending?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
we
can
try
to
very
clear
about
this.
are
you
saying
that
the
order
we
have
before
us
is
an
error
or
failure
of
the
commission
to
include
and
increment
over
and
above
the
rate
fixed?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
claim
that
the
great
aspects
because
they
don't
allow
you
exactly
in
the
–
in
a
special
amount
for
that
one
and
for
pre
--
or
confiscatory?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
your
clients
because
your
client
--
has
inquiry
rates
confiscatory
as
to
your
plan,
is
that
your
contention?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
you
state
for
us
in
the
constitution,
the
statutory
terms,
what
you're
legal
point
is
apart
from
(inaudible)
and
due
process
clause?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
before
whether
you
are
complaining
about
failure
to
include
business
cost
and
the
failure
to
make
special
allowance
in
the
rates
and
i
thought
you
said
the
limit.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
although
you
don't
complain
about
the
overall
rate,
you
say
the
overall
rate
is
not
confiscatory
as
to
your
client
nor
is
the
overall
rate
i
assume,
i
don't
know,
you
claim
that
if
the
overall,
it
doesn't
give
you
an
adequate
return,
i
don't
understand
--
really
i
don't
understand
--
and
your
position
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
in
a
constitutional
statutory
terms.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
i
don't
want
too
right
now.
well,
i
got
to
do
(inaudible)
of
your
client?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
call
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
what
do
you
think
those
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
they
should've
done?
i
understand
the
method
that
they
used
was
to
assume
that
they
got
20
years
in
which
to
--
recovery
of
(inaudible)
and
the
--
they
made
a
distribution
of
your
capital
cost
over
that
period
of
time,
and
what
do
you
think
they
should've
done?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
alternative
into
what
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
essentially
different
from
what
they
did?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
they
may.
they
arrived
at
an
overall
figure,
i
don't
understand
you
really.
commission
arrived
at
an
overall
figure.
you're
suggesting
that
they
should
have
taken,
arrived
at
separate
figures
for
new
gas-well
gas
and
for
old
gas-well
gas,
and
for
oil
well
gas,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
--
are
you
saying
--
that
you're
not
saying,
are
you
that
the
record
does
not
contain
substantial
evidence
on
the
point,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
do
you
do
that,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
these
rates
haven't
gone
into
effect,
have
they?
justice
abe
fortas
these
rates
have
not
gone
into
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
apart
from
the
moratorium
or
the
--
none
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there's
more
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
moratorium
order,
the
effect
of
that's
been
stayed
too.
justice
abe
fortas
so
and
the
--
then
the
moratorium
expires
january
1.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
any
factual
or
realistic
point,
that
issue
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
set
apart
from
the
question
of
principle
and
theory
of
the
--
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
they
could
live,
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that,
did
anybody
been
heard?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
anybody
do
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
nobody
can
be
heard
thereafter?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no.
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
order
in
this
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we
decide
it
after
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
they've
got
it.
there's
quite
a
few
problems
in
this
case
as
i
understand
that
it
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
is
whether
we
have
to
face
up
with
this
point
too.
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
that
be?
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
16
and
14?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
contending
for
is
the
minimum?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
saying
it's
wrong
but
you
don't
have
--
supposed
they
fixed
it
overall
as
you're
doing
now,
you're
quarrelling
with
the
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
should
it
be?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
arguing
that
9
cents
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there's
no
indication
at
all
to
me,
because
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statutes
that
says,
the
purpose
in
--
of
the
commission
adopted
a
purpose
for
a
minimum
rate
would
be
--
the
commission
have
to
adopt
any
minimum
in
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
--
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
introduce
that
from
phillips
2.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
this
ought
to
include
the
total
exploration
cost
regardless
of
what
they
are?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i've
asked
you
before.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
hope
you
would
be.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
suppose
a
company,
your
client
for
example
decided
that
it
was
going
out
--
to
try
to
get
20%
share
of
the
market
and
then
in
5
years,
and
therefore
it
--
i
don't
know
what
the
share
market
is.
but
supposed
your
client
has
a
half
of
one
percent
now
and
i
don't
mean
an
(inaudible),
and
supposed
that
it
got
a
--
had
as
its
target
to
get
20%
for
5
years
and
then
they
got
up
a
tremendous
exploration
market,
do
you
think
all
of
that
ought
to
be
included
as
cost
of
operation?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
come
on
down.
justice
abe
fortas
so
why
couldn't
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
couldn't
it
--
what
terms,
prudent
--
related
to
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
approval?
every
cent
you
spent,
let's
assume
that
every
cent
you
spent
was
prudent,
conservative,
dominated
by
genius
and
inspired
by
conservatism.
if
he
wants
to
assume
--
if
he
wants
to
assume
the
legitimacy
for
ratemaking
purposes
of
the
objective
mainly
to
engage
in
exploration
which
will
let
you
get
20%
of
the
market
in
five
years.
justice
abe
fortas
okay,
i
take
--
i
see
we're
not
heading
there.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
the
commission's
approach
here,
only
tried
of
the
part
of
the
commission's
approach
here
as
if
the
rates
have
been
fixed
here
on
such
generous
basis
that
something
good
for
everybody.
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
class
would
come
to
everybody
and
now
--
and
i
say,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
it
has
evidence
in
this
threshold
coupled
with
an
offer
of
approval
that
would
show
that
these
rates
are
confiscatory
as
to
the
sun
oil
company.
justice
abe
fortas
well
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
show
that
--
my
question
here
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
show
that
it's
confiscatory?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
afraid
that
i
missed
you.
i
thought
you
said
the
12.72
cents
per
mcf
was
the
average
return
on
the
basis
of
actual
rates.
justice
abe
fortas
applying
what?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
if
--
as
of
1960
then
you're
telling
us,
if
you
take
the
actual
contract
prices
in
effect
the
average
return
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
justice
abe
fortas
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
that
compare
with
the
14
point
whatever
it
was
and
the
16
point
whatever
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
saying
--
what
i'm
asking
is
this,
commission
found
that
as
of
1960,
the
--
what
do
you
call,
that
average
return,
whatever
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
average
revenue
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
commission
set
rates
to
near
average
revenues,
is
that
right,
of
14.5
cents
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
where
i
want
to
get
straighten
out.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
average
cost
--
justice
abe
fortas
14.5
cents
and
the
16.5
cents
new
gas
in
which
you
say
is
that
relevant
purposes
of
comparison.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
and
the
1960
revenue
was
12.72
cents
which
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
almost
2
cents
lower.
the
revenue
is
2
cents
lower
than
the
figure
that
the
commission
found
to
be
the
average
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
at
that
time.
now,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
then
if
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
take
this
though
as
fair
figures
the
commission
need
a
figured
cost
generously
or
the
average
cost
would
appear
on
this
very
superficial
and
highly
unreal
basis
to
the
average
cost
was
almost
2
cents
higher
than
the
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
now,
excuse
me.
where
does
the
12%
figure
come
in?
was
that
over
and
above
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
in
the
14.5?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
generalized
figure?
that
is
to
say
those
--
you
refer
to
the
pipeline
cost
for
bringing
up
a
substandard
gas.
now
is
that
a
single
figure
that
the
commission
has
arrived
at
or
is
about
to
arrive
at?
justice
abe
fortas
through
it's
pipeline
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
your
honor,
yesterday
there
was
a
reference
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
estimates.
the
commission
made
one
most
critical
statement
however,
and
that
was
that
the
record
does
not
permit
a
finding
as
to
the
financial
impact
of
these
deductions.
justice
abe
fortas
but
supposed
that
a
margin
of
1
point
if
you
take
the
cost
here
as
being
1.7
cents
per
mcf,
you're
still
within
the
12.72
cents
per
mcf
for
having
this
revenue,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
correct.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
is
the
average
cost?
that's
not
the
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
the
oil
was
--
every
time
a
rate
case
i've
ever
heard
off
is
that
the
sliding
words
necessarily
so
because
that's
what
the
language
is
and
you
can't
get
around
that.
but
this
14.5-cent
average
cost
includes
the
12%
return.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
cost
gets
to
be
kind
of
a
clear
thing.
but
you
still
haven't
gotten
us
found
below
the
average
of
actual
revenue
in
1960
average.
and
we
don't
have
any
evidence
i
supposed
or
do
we
have
evidence
as
to
what
the
--
with
history,
could
work
it
out
as
to
what
the
average
cost
without
reference
to
the
12%
would
be
on
1960
on
a
natural
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
you
don't
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
that
figure
is,
the
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
they
did
that
and
suppose
they
found
an
excess
for
the
group,
then
what
would
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
for
the
group,
then
what
would
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
that
be
done?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
revenue
with
--
and
just
to
make
this
clear,
if
you
took
that
1960
and
have
a
14.5
cent
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
called
cost
revenue
period
--
justice
abe
fortas
right?
justice
abe
fortas
a
revenue
requirement,
that's
good.
justice
abe
fortas
revenue
requirement.
and
you'd
compare
that
with
a
--
with
what?
with
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
12
--
wait
a
minute.
let
me
ask
you
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
compare
that
with
the
12.72
cents
average
revenue
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
1960.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
to
put
it
in
another
way,
if
you
applied
the
commission
rates
without
reference
to
the
allowance
for
equality
inferiority
which
maybe
substantial
if
--
i
don't
know.
but
if
you
take
that
14.5
cent
figure
as
the
rate
of
the
commission
gave
you,
they
gave
you
a
rate
that
was
higher
than
the
average
--
than
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
return
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
that's
also
the
rate,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
as
--
and
i
would
--
the
commission
fixed
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
maximum
rate.
justice
abe
fortas
as
well
as
what
you've
referred
to
as
revenue
requirement.
it's
a
maximum
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
rate
and
if
you
take
that
and
compare
it
with
your
average
revenue
in
1960
you
get
your
rate
fixed
by
the
commission
at
14.5
cents
less
whatever
it
should
be
deducted
from
it
as
compared
with
12.72
cents,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
--
no,
no,
no,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
taking
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
taking
that
14.5
cent
figure
and
working
backwards
on
it.
i've
combat
your
actual
operations.
does
the
record
show
that
on
the
basis
of
your
actual
operations
in
the
year
1960,
the
industry
lost
money
on
its
gas
operations
as
a
result
of
permian
--
in
the
permian
basin
operations.
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
commission
would
--
couldn't
say
that
looking
at
it
on
an
aggregate
or
a
group
basis
in
generosity
of
their
rates
as
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
they
almost
a
cent
higher
than
what
el
paso
paid
on
the
average.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i
say
that
if
you
compare
those
two
figures,
i
understood
that
you
are
not
arguing
that
the
commission
fixed
the
rates
of
the
--
maximum
rates
that
were
too
high.
justice
abe
fortas
assuming
what
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
they
challenge
it
as
a
maximum
rate
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
they
or
did
--
do
you
--
do
they
or
do
they
--
did
--
do
your
clients
or
do
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
your
clients
don't
challenge
the
maximum
rate
figure
as
such.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
if
you
don't
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
maximum
rates
fixed
by
the
commission,
you
just
think
they
were
done
on
a
wrong
basis
and
that
they
ought
to
be
redesigned
so
that
they
would
take
account
of
individual
variations.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
was
coming
back
--
not
your
argument
on
the
refunds
but
the
argument
made
by
your
co-counsel
and
what
is
your
attack
on
the
rates
then?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
having
a
great
difficulty
and
i'm
sure
it's
my
own
fault
but
i'm
still
having
a
difficulty.
now,
either
you
are
or
you
are
not
attacking
the
maximum
rates
as
maximum
rates,
they're
maximum
--
this
is
a
maximum
rate.
now,
and
it
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
permit
as
it
set
now,
it
does
not
provide
for
exceptions.
justice
abe
fortas
now
are
you
attacking
the
maximum
rate
in
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
doing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
you're
attacking
the
maximum
rates
fixed
by
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
there
ought
to
be
that
the
rate's
structure
should
be
such
that
the
maximum
rate
should
be
increased
for
certain
types
of
operations
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
certain
types
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
see
--
i
really
have
difficulty
in
seeing
how
you
can
make
that
argument
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
say
that
you're
not
opposing
the
fixing
of
--
the
theory
of
fixing
group
rates.
so
that's
my
difficulty,
i
guess.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
any
square
of
those
which
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
where
i
have
my
trouble.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
figure
that
was
given
to
us
was
1.
--
i
think
it
was
a
maximum
rate
--
of
the
range
of
1.7
cents
deduction
for
this
pipeline
cost
due
to
the
lower
quality
of
the
gas.
and
if
you'd
deduct
that
from
14.5
cents,
you're
still
above
12.72.
now,
my
method
of
--
my
approach
to
this
must
be
wrong
when
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument.
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
to
tell
me
where
and
how?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
but
that
also
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
includes
a
return.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
say
in
this
--
what
you're
saying
mr.
gillian
depends
upon
going
from
the
group
average
basis
to
the
individual
basis
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
i
guess,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
you
that
when
you
start
engaging
in
that
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
mess.
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
you
have
findings
on
that?
what
the
commission
is
doing
in
effect
is
saying
that
people
who
have
this
point
made
contacts
for
gas.
and
more
of
them
14.5
just
as
you've
said
roughly
have
to
and
--
have
to
or
reduce
a
future
contract
to
that
point.
people
have
made
contracts
at
lower
figure
and
if
the
marketplace
permits
to
make
contracts
at
a
higher
figure
than
their
previous
contract
price
up
to
14.5.
well
now,
actually
on
the
basis
of
experience
as
i
understand
this,
the
industry
revenues
may
not
be
14.5,
they're
maybe
less
than
that
rate
by
considerable
amount,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
rejection
of
what?
justice
abe
fortas
rejection
of
what,
mr.
solomon?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
distributors,
you
mean
the
pipeline
companies?
justice
abe
fortas
whom
do
you
then?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
when
you've
been
talking
about
distributors
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
producer
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solomon,
when
you
talked
about
directionality,
you
mean
prospecting,
directed
to
the
discovery
of
gas-wells
as
distinguished
from
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
in
this
--
can
you
tell
what
the
–
a
producer
or
prospector
is
going
for?
in
other
words,
does
the
technique
used
to
prospect
for
gas
is
so
different
from
the
technique
used
to
prospect
for
oil,
if
you
can
tell
which
names
the
outcome,
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
the
subject
of
the
facts
here.
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
information
that
was
collected
confined
to
the
permian
basin,
these
questionnaires
you're
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
only
matched?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
conclusions
here
are
based
on
national
data?
justice
abe
fortas
before
we
get
to
that,
mr.
solomon,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
you
just
said
that
the
commission
arrived
a
cost
of
gas-well
gas
and
then
trended
that
back
to
find
the
cost
for
old
well
gas
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
old
gas-well
gas,
and
the
--
then
took
that
figure
and
used
that
as
the
basis
for
costing
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
gas
in
association
with
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
in
other
words,
that
the
--
let
me
make
sure,
that
the
oil-well
gas
was
priced
by
reference
to
the
old
gas-well
gas.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
have
i
got
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we're
going
to
say
--
and
then
say
12%
rate
of
returns
which
you
have
talked
about,
are
you
going
to
elaborate
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
the
12%
rate
of
return,
or
was
that
a
private
--
is
that
applied
across
the
board
to
all
producers?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
was
not
especially
calibrated
being
a
small
producer?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
what
percentage
of
the
--
totaled
out
for
the
--
in
the
permian
basin
to
distribute
it
to
small
producers
as
you
define
small
producers.
you
said
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
a
12
--
that
the
12%
figure
as
a
rate
of
return
was
determined
by
the
commission
because
of
the
problem
of
the
small
producers?
justice
abe
fortas
you
were
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
everybody
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
everybody
gets
such
a
nice,
good,
fat
rate
of
return
that
small
producers
aren't
--
not
to
complain
despite
the
possibility
that
they
may
have
a
special
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that.
well,
i
have
a
difficulty
in
reading
the
material,
the
–
in
understanding
here
in
--
that
there
was
any
special
relationship
between
the
12%
rate
of
return
and
the
special
problem,
if
one
exists
with
the
small
producers.
and
to
what
you've
said
now,
i
gather
that
this
is
not
the
same
that
the
12%
whole
rate
of
return
overall
are
to
take
care
of
the
smaller
producers
as
well
as
everybody
else.
justice
abe
fortas
will
significantly
affect
what?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
conservation
interests
involved
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
the
commission
takes
that
into
account
on
abandonment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
they'll
conduct
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
will
continue
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
–
as
the
price
fix
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
the
fact
that
this
is
a
natural
resource
of
--
that
there
are
conservation
values
involved
here
give
you
any
comfort
with
respect
to
supporting
this
price
regulation.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
remember
any
reference
to
the
special
impact,
if
any,
that
in
fact,
that
this
natural
resource
may
have
upon
the
legal
issues
to
some
of
the
cases,
how
much
you
rely.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
about
--
what
is
the
range
of
variation
in
the
contract
price
now
in
the
permian
basin?
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
no,
let's
take
a
contract
negotiation
in
a
short
range
of
time.
well,
let's
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
there's
so
much
variation
within
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
take
contracts
that
are
negotiated
within
the
10-day
or
30-day
period
of
time,
is
there
much
of
a
range
in
the
price
term
of
those
contracts?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
in
the
negotiation
of
contracts
at
a
particular
point
of
time,
the
individual
situation
determines
price,
whether
the
price
is
determined
by
the
clustering
of
the
marketplace.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
do
take
--
do
you
take
the
position
on
where
the
contract
price
is
higher
than
the
--
merely
price
--
the
contract
price
suggested
value?
justice
abe
fortas
but
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
two
as
a
legal
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps,
i
don't
understand
this.
but
i'm
going
to
ask
you
this
question.
a
producer
in
the
permian
basin
has
a
contract
10
years
ago
for
the
sale
of
gas
at
a
price
that
is
lower
than
your
area
rate.
the
producer
with
the
consent
of
the
company
purchasing
from
that
producer
comes
to
the
commission
and
says
that,
“i
want
to
raise
my
--
this
contract
price”,
do
you
or
do
you
not
permit
that
or
do
you
prohibit
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
escalation.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
escalations.
they
want
to
bring
it
up
to
the
rate
that
–
as
described
in
your
schedule?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
they
come
in
and
say
it
doesn't
–
it's
not
written
into
this
contract
where
originally
entered
into
but
we
agree
now
that
the
rate
be
raised,
the
producer
and
the
purchaser,
and
with
your
schedule
from
the
pricing
system
here
prohibit
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
your
position
is
that
your
escape
clause
is
broad
enough
so
that
somebody
thinks
that
confiscatory
result
has
been
occasioned
by
a
preexisting
application.
can
come
in
and
seek
relief
or
he
can
file
or
(inaudible)
and
start
and
take
off
a
proceeding
that
way
which
presumably
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so,
or
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
commission's
order
does
not
commit
the
commission
on
granting
relief
in
those
circumstances
but
you
would
say
that
it
has
power
to
do
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals,
i
suppose
on
the
criticisms
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
was
that
you
--
the
commission
did
not
commit
itself
to
give
relief
in
these
hypothetical
con
--
in
situations
of
individually
confiscatory
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
it
–
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
me
generally
whether
it's
shows
a
higher
or
a
lower
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
excuse
me
sir,
what
percentage
if
you
can
give
us
an
idea,
what
percentage
of
the
cost
figure
here
is
represented
by
exploration
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
30%?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
beg
your
pardon?
what
is
that
1.1
cents?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
against
the
4
point
something
cents.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
i
understand
your
position
that
–
should
at
least
say
it
this
way
that
you're
saying
that
1
--
only
1.1
cents
out
of
this
4
point
something
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
standards
and
beyond
that,
there
is
an
allowance
made
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
(inaudible)?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
see,
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
is
that
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
remainder
is
the
replacement
of
the
price,
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
spending
stock
as
preserved
presented
so
to
speak.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
the
average,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
about
the
extreme
or
to
say
that
very
high
cost
producer.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
another
question,
i
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
most
figures,
you
don't
like
the
idea.
justice
abe
fortas
well
how
did
your
largest
customer
range
for
that
gas?
is
it
somewhat
--
it's
a
pipeline
more
than
el
paso?
justice
abe
fortas
the
matter
what
–
made
that
way
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
there
--
mr.
merrill,
was
there
also
a
change
in
the
underlying
facts
that
is
to
say,
when
did
the
directional
technique
of
--
for
finding
gas
oil
--
gas
oils
of
--
become
an
important
factor
in
the
industry?
i
don't
know,
let's
review
our
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
you
ask
that
(voice
overlap)
--
you
heard
the
argument
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i
suppose
--
let's
supposed
there
did
come
a
point
of
time
that
would
show
--
let
us
say
a
majority
of
the
gas
that
were
sold
was
a
gas-well
gas,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
can
you
approximate
that
point
of
time
for
us?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
this
have
happened
after
the
statement
made
by
the
commission
on
the
second
phillips
case?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
let
me
just
state
to
you
what's
running
through
my
mind.
i
don't
know
whether
its
sound.
but
what's
running
through
my
mind
is
that
the
impression
of
the
argument
--
from
the
argument
yesterday
that
there
came
a
point
of
time
when
gas-well
gas
became
a
predominant
importance
in
the
industry.
and
the
possibility
that
because
of
that
change
in
the
characteristics
of
the
industry,
a
quotation
that
you
just
read
from
the
commission's
second
philips
case
may
not
have
had
the
same
opinion,
say
in
the
same
thrust
that
it
had
at
the
time
that
the
commission
wrote
that.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
opposing
contentions
bear
in
my
mind
and
if
i
correctly
understand
the
situation,
perhaps
very
likelihood
i
don't.
at
a
time
when
the
industry
was
dominated
by
gas
that
was
produced
jointly
with
oil,
say,
the
commission
made
the
--
that
at
that
time,
the
commission
said
that
the
use
of
a
cost
data
is
not
feasible
because
of
the
necessarily
arbitrary
characteristics
of
allocating
joint
cost.
then
there
came
a
point
of
time
when
it
was
not
gas
and
association
with
oil
but
gas
that
had
been
produced
more
or
less
independently
of
oil.
at
that
became
dominant
in
the
industry
and
the
question
that
the
arguments
today
and
what
you've
said
here
raised
in
my
mind
is
whether
that
may
have
made
a
difference
in
the
logic
of
the
commission
statement
in
the
second
phillips.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
merrill,
is
there
a
different
--
a
legal
distinction
between
the
commission's
job
and
the
job
of
their
reviewing
forth
with
respect
to
this
consideration?
that
is
to
say,
you
argue
and
i
think
understand
it,
that
an
incentive
--
price
incentive
has
to
be
provided
in
the
rate
structure
in
the
national
intrastate,
i
quite
understand
that
i
think.
the
question
is
does
a
--
does
that
consideration
apply
with
the
same
vigor
in
terms
of
the
reviewing
court's
function
as
it
does
in
terms
of
the
administrative
agency,
that
is
to
say
are
franchises
not
total
that
completes
franchise?
what
your
--
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(inaudible)
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
are
different
matters.
and
i
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
talking
to
you
about
this
matter
providing
an
incentive
for
exploration.
well,
do
you
derive
that
from
the
constitutional
provision
or
from
something
in
the
statute
or
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
is
the
judicially
and
forcible
duty
of
the
commission
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
--
(inaudible)
is
to
what
is
there
--
what
specific
provision
on
the
constitution
or
what
specific
provision
in
the
statute?
do
you
rely
upon
to
say
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
court's
to
require
not
only
that
the
commission
pay
or
what
justice
jackson,
that
the
commission
provide
payment
for
a
cost
of
producing
the
gas
but
also
that
the
commission
provide
rates
that
will
give
an
incentive
for
exploration,
kind
of
distinction
that
mr.
justice
jackson
made
the
--
in
that
quotation
that
you
read.
that's
what
i'm
asking
about.
what
is
the
specific
provision
of
law
on
which
you
rely
with
respect
from
the
question
of
public
--
imperative
public
policy?
justice
abe
fortas
but
general,
do
i
understand
that
you're
not
attacking
the
rates
fixed
by
the
federal
power
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
your
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
mattered
but,
are
you
urging
that
the
states
are
prejudiced
by
the
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
how
so?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean
to
say
if
you
do
--
if
you
are
--
not,
if
you
don't
take
the
position
that
these
rates
are
fixed
so
as
to
injure
the
conservation
interest
of
the
state,
how
is
the
state
prejudiced
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
did
you
take
the
9.5%,
the
preparation
of
the
exhibit
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
initially?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
where
did
the
9.5%
figure
come
from?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
object
to
the
9.5%?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
this
rate
is
confiscatory
as
to
the
hunt
oil
company
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
record
contains
evidence
to
demonstrate
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
percentage
if
you
can
tell
me,
as
your
cost
as
shown
with
--
related
to
exploration?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
however
that
may
be,
is
it
your
position
that
to
determine
the
(inaudible)
the
lower
rates
confiscatory
that
your
coal
exploration
cost
has
to
be
taken
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
constitutional
question.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
asking
it
to
you
for
your
--
i'm
asking
about
it
because
of
its
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
it
should
be
some.
that
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
fine.
now,
on
a
reasonable
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
question
is
that
the
industry
average
is
4%
and
the
history
shows
that
the
volume
and
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
history
shows
that
the
volume
has
been
that
has
been
sold
--
has
been
replaced,
is
it
--
would
it
still
be
your
position
that
hunt
oil
should
be
allowed
to
call
such
a
percent?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you'd
have
to
discount
this
cost
on
that
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
say
that
perhaps,
can
you
tell
me,
if
you
took
only
the
fair
return,
whatever
that
might
be
on
the
amount
of
your
investment
in
the
existing
oil
wells
and
your
operating
expenses
excluding
exploration,
would
the
results
still
be
confiscatory
as
to
hunt
oil
company
under
these
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
a
small
independent
producer,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
still
--
you
say
that
excluding
all
cost
for
exploration
that
a
rate
of
return
--
fair
rate
of
return
on
the
investment,
i
won't
ask
you
what
that
is,
plus
your
our
of
pocket
operating
expenses,
if
these
rates,
you
would
not
be
covering
those
two
items?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
for
the
moment,
yes
sir
because
that's
what
i
understood
you
argue
in
your
last
statement
i
--
to
the
time
you
made
which
i'm
sorry
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
we're
talking
only
about
permian
basin.
it's
not
covered
for
us
at
the
moment.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
think
i
follow
on
this
but
i
hate
to
take
more
of
your
time,
the
problem
that
perplexes
me
in
this
field
is,
how
you
can
really
be
in
anywhere
with
respect
to
the
confiscation
argument
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
exploration
cost
here
are
absolutely
with
--
are
almost
absolutely
within
the
control
of
the
producer.
now
this
to
say
that
the
argument
assumes
that
the
--
that
if
a
producer
at
all
--
if
the
argument
assumes
that
all
a
producer's
exploration
cost
are
properly
part
of
the
cost
base
for
purposes
of
confiscation,
then
if
a
producer
can
go
out
and
--
to
enlarge
his
own
supply
and
spend
all
the
money
that
he
can
beg
or
borrow
for
exploration
just
to
enlarge
his
own
position
in
the
industry
and
his
own
share
of
market
and
that
--
all
of
that
cost
would
go
to
this
cost
base
and
he'll
use
it
for
purposes
of
measuring
confiscation
and
that's
a
concept
that
--
does
not
at
all
like
the
usual
thing
that
lawyer
encounters
in
this
or
--
with
the
respect
to
the
constitutional
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
my
question
to
you
is,
does
this
record
with
respect
to
your
client
--
does
this
record
contain
information
sufficiently
specific
individualized
and
precise
so
as
to
permit
a
judgment
on
that
point
either
in
terms
of
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
or
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
proof.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
about
including
the
offer
of
--
any
offer
of
proof
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
they
should
be
compensated
for
that
cost,
you
mean
that
they
ought
to
be
a
rate
plus
something
else
fixed
by
the
commission
or
do
you
mean
--
or
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
error
in
the
failure
to
include
this
in
cost
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i'm
asking
you
which
--
for
which
position
are
you
contending?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
we
can
try
to
very
clear
about
this.
are
you
saying
that
the
order
we
have
before
us
is
an
error
or
failure
of
the
commission
to
include
and
increment
over
and
above
the
rate
fixed?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
claim
that
the
great
aspects
because
they
don't
allow
you
exactly
in
the
–
in
a
special
amount
for
that
one
and
for
pre
--
or
confiscatory?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
your
clients
because
your
client
--
has
inquiry
rates
confiscatory
as
to
your
plan,
is
that
your
contention?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
you
state
for
us
in
the
constitution,
the
statutory
terms,
what
you're
legal
point
is
apart
from
(inaudible)
and
due
process
clause?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
before
whether
you
are
complaining
about
failure
to
include
business
cost
and
the
failure
to
make
special
allowance
in
the
rates
and
i
thought
you
said
the
limit.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
although
you
don't
complain
about
the
overall
rate,
you
say
the
overall
rate
is
not
confiscatory
as
to
your
client
nor
is
the
overall
rate
i
assume,
i
don't
know,
you
claim
that
if
the
overall,
it
doesn't
give
you
an
adequate
return,
i
don't
understand
--
really
i
don't
understand
--
and
your
position
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
in
a
constitutional
statutory
terms.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
i
don't
want
too
right
now.
well,
i
got
to
do
(inaudible)
of
your
client?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
call
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
what
do
you
think
those
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
they
should've
done?
i
understand
the
method
that
they
used
was
to
assume
that
they
got
20
years
in
which
to
--
recovery
of
(inaudible)
and
the
--
they
made
a
distribution
of
your
capital
cost
over
that
period
of
time,
and
what
do
you
think
they
should've
done?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
alternative
into
what
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
essentially
different
from
what
they
did?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
they
may.
they
arrived
at
an
overall
figure,
i
don't
understand
you
really.
commission
arrived
at
an
overall
figure.
you're
suggesting
that
they
should
have
taken,
arrived
at
separate
figures
for
new
gas-well
gas
and
for
old
gas-well
gas,
and
for
oil
well
gas,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
--
are
you
saying
--
that
you're
not
saying,
are
you
that
the
record
does
not
contain
substantial
evidence
on
the
point,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
do
you
do
that,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
these
rates
haven't
gone
into
effect,
have
they?
justice
abe
fortas
these
rates
have
not
gone
into
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
apart
from
the
moratorium
or
the
--
none
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there's
more
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
moratorium
order,
the
effect
of
that's
been
stayed
too.
justice
abe
fortas
so
and
the
--
then
the
moratorium
expires
january
1.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
any
factual
or
realistic
point,
that
issue
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
set
apart
from
the
question
of
principle
and
theory
of
the
--
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
they
could
live,
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that,
did
anybody
been
heard?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
anybody
do
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
nobody
can
be
heard
thereafter?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no.
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
order
in
this
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we
decide
it
after
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
they've
got
it.
there's
quite
a
few
problems
in
this
case
as
i
understand
that
it
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
is
whether
we
have
to
face
up
with
this
point
too.
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
that
be?
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
16
and
14?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
contending
for
is
the
minimum?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
saying
it's
wrong
but
you
don't
have
--
supposed
they
fixed
it
overall
as
you're
doing
now,
you're
quarrelling
with
the
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
should
it
be?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
arguing
that
9
cents
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there's
no
indication
at
all
to
me,
because
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statutes
that
says,
the
purpose
in
--
of
the
commission
adopted
a
purpose
for
a
minimum
rate
would
be
--
the
commission
have
to
adopt
any
minimum
in
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
--
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
introduce
that
from
phillips
2.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
this
ought
to
include
the
total
exploration
cost
regardless
of
what
they
are?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i've
asked
you
before.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
hope
you
would
be.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
suppose
a
company,
your
client
for
example
decided
that
it
was
going
out
--
to
try
to
get
20%
share
of
the
market
and
then
in
5
years,
and
therefore
it
--
i
don't
know
what
the
share
market
is.
but
supposed
your
client
has
a
half
of
one
percent
now
and
i
don't
mean
an
(inaudible),
and
supposed
that
it
got
a
--
had
as
its
target
to
get
20%
for
5
years
and
then
they
got
up
a
tremendous
exploration
market,
do
you
think
all
of
that
ought
to
be
included
as
cost
of
operation?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
come
on
down.
justice
abe
fortas
so
why
couldn't
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
couldn't
it
--
what
terms,
prudent
--
related
to
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
approval?
every
cent
you
spent,
let's
assume
that
every
cent
you
spent
was
prudent,
conservative,
dominated
by
genius
and
inspired
by
conservatism.
if
he
wants
to
assume
--
if
he
wants
to
assume
the
legitimacy
for
ratemaking
purposes
of
the
objective
mainly
to
engage
in
exploration
which
will
let
you
get
20%
of
the
market
in
five
years.
justice
abe
fortas
okay,
i
take
--
i
see
we're
not
heading
there.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
the
commission's
approach
here,
only
tried
of
the
part
of
the
commission's
approach
here
as
if
the
rates
have
been
fixed
here
on
such
generous
basis
that
something
good
for
everybody.
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
class
would
come
to
everybody
and
now
--
and
i
say,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
it
has
evidence
in
this
threshold
coupled
with
an
offer
of
approval
that
would
show
that
these
rates
are
confiscatory
as
to
the
sun
oil
company.
justice
abe
fortas
well
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
show
that
--
my
question
here
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
show
that
it's
confiscatory?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
afraid
that
i
missed
you.
i
thought
you
said
the
12.72
cents
per
mcf
was
the
average
return
on
the
basis
of
actual
rates.
justice
abe
fortas
applying
what?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
if
--
as
of
1960
then
you're
telling
us,
if
you
take
the
actual
contract
prices
in
effect
the
average
return
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
justice
abe
fortas
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
that
compare
with
the
14
point
whatever
it
was
and
the
16
point
whatever
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
saying
--
what
i'm
asking
is
this,
commission
found
that
as
of
1960,
the
--
what
do
you
call,
that
average
return,
whatever
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
average
revenue
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
commission
set
rates
to
near
average
revenues,
is
that
right,
of
14.5
cents
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
where
i
want
to
get
straighten
out.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
average
cost
--
justice
abe
fortas
14.5
cents
and
the
16.5
cents
new
gas
in
which
you
say
is
that
relevant
purposes
of
comparison.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
and
the
1960
revenue
was
12.72
cents
which
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
almost
2
cents
lower.
the
revenue
is
2
cents
lower
than
the
figure
that
the
commission
found
to
be
the
average
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
at
that
time.
now,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
then
if
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
take
this
though
as
fair
figures
the
commission
need
a
figured
cost
generously
or
the
average
cost
would
appear
on
this
very
superficial
and
highly
unreal
basis
to
the
average
cost
was
almost
2
cents
higher
than
the
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
now,
excuse
me.
where
does
the
12%
figure
come
in?
was
that
over
and
above
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
in
the
14.5?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
generalized
figure?
that
is
to
say
those
--
you
refer
to
the
pipeline
cost
for
bringing
up
a
substandard
gas.
now
is
that
a
single
figure
that
the
commission
has
arrived
at
or
is
about
to
arrive
at?
justice
abe
fortas
through
it's
pipeline
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
your
honor,
yesterday
there
was
a
reference
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
estimates.
the
commission
made
one
most
critical
statement
however,
and
that
was
that
the
record
does
not
permit
a
finding
as
to
the
financial
impact
of
these
deductions.
justice
abe
fortas
but
supposed
that
a
margin
of
1
point
if
you
take
the
cost
here
as
being
1.7
cents
per
mcf,
you're
still
within
the
12.72
cents
per
mcf
for
having
this
revenue,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
correct.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
is
the
average
cost?
that's
not
the
average
revenue.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
the
oil
was
--
every
time
a
rate
case
i've
ever
heard
off
is
that
the
sliding
words
necessarily
so
because
that's
what
the
language
is
and
you
can't
get
around
that.
but
this
14.5-cent
average
cost
includes
the
12%
return.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
cost
gets
to
be
kind
of
a
clear
thing.
but
you
still
haven't
gotten
us
found
below
the
average
of
actual
revenue
in
1960
average.
and
we
don't
have
any
evidence
i
supposed
or
do
we
have
evidence
as
to
what
the
--
with
history,
could
work
it
out
as
to
what
the
average
cost
without
reference
to
the
12%
would
be
on
1960
on
a
natural
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
you
don't
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
that
figure
is,
the
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
they
did
that
and
suppose
they
found
an
excess
for
the
group,
then
what
would
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
for
the
group,
then
what
would
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
that
be
done?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
revenue
with
--
and
just
to
make
this
clear,
if
you
took
that
1960
and
have
a
14.5
cent
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
called
cost
revenue
period
--
justice
abe
fortas
right?
justice
abe
fortas
a
revenue
requirement,
that's
good.
justice
abe
fortas
revenue
requirement.
and
you'd
compare
that
with
a
--
with
what?
with
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
12
--
wait
a
minute.
let
me
ask
you
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
compare
that
with
the
12.72
cents
average
revenue
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
1960.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
to
put
it
in
another
way,
if
you
applied
the
commission
rates
without
reference
to
the
allowance
for
equality
inferiority
which
maybe
substantial
if
--
i
don't
know.
but
if
you
take
that
14.5
cent
figure
as
the
rate
of
the
commission
gave
you,
they
gave
you
a
rate
that
was
higher
than
the
average
--
than
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
return
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
that's
also
the
rate,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
as
--
and
i
would
--
the
commission
fixed
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
maximum
rate.
justice
abe
fortas
as
well
as
what
you've
referred
to
as
revenue
requirement.
it's
a
maximum
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
rate
and
if
you
take
that
and
compare
it
with
your
average
revenue
in
1960
you
get
your
rate
fixed
by
the
commission
at
14.5
cents
less
whatever
it
should
be
deducted
from
it
as
compared
with
12.72
cents,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
--
no,
no,
no,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
taking
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
taking
that
14.5
cent
figure
and
working
backwards
on
it.
i've
combat
your
actual
operations.
does
the
record
show
that
on
the
basis
of
your
actual
operations
in
the
year
1960,
the
industry
lost
money
on
its
gas
operations
as
a
result
of
permian
--
in
the
permian
basin
operations.
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
commission
would
--
couldn't
say
that
looking
at
it
on
an
aggregate
or
a
group
basis
in
generosity
of
their
rates
as
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
they
almost
a
cent
higher
than
what
el
paso
paid
on
the
average.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i
say
that
if
you
compare
those
two
figures,
i
understood
that
you
are
not
arguing
that
the
commission
fixed
the
rates
of
the
--
maximum
rates
that
were
too
high.
justice
abe
fortas
assuming
what
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
they
challenge
it
as
a
maximum
rate
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
they
or
did
--
do
you
--
do
they
or
do
they
--
did
--
do
your
clients
or
do
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
your
clients
don't
challenge
the
maximum
rate
figure
as
such.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
if
you
don't
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
maximum
rates
fixed
by
the
commission,
you
just
think
they
were
done
on
a
wrong
basis
and
that
they
ought
to
be
redesigned
so
that
they
would
take
account
of
individual
variations.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
was
coming
back
--
not
your
argument
on
the
refunds
but
the
argument
made
by
your
co-counsel
and
what
is
your
attack
on
the
rates
then?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
having
a
great
difficulty
and
i'm
sure
it's
my
own
fault
but
i'm
still
having
a
difficulty.
now,
either
you
are
or
you
are
not
attacking
the
maximum
rates
as
maximum
rates,
they're
maximum
--
this
is
a
maximum
rate.
now,
and
it
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
permit
as
it
set
now,
it
does
not
provide
for
exceptions.
justice
abe
fortas
now
are
you
attacking
the
maximum
rate
in
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
doing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
you're
attacking
the
maximum
rates
fixed
by
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
there
ought
to
be
that
the
rate's
structure
should
be
such
that
the
maximum
rate
should
be
increased
for
certain
types
of
operations
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
certain
types
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
see
--
i
really
have
difficulty
in
seeing
how
you
can
make
that
argument
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
say
that
you're
not
opposing
the
fixing
of
--
the
theory
of
fixing
group
rates.
so
that's
my
difficulty,
i
guess.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
any
square
of
those
which
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
where
i
have
my
trouble.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
figure
that
was
given
to
us
was
1.
--
i
think
it
was
a
maximum
rate
--
of
the
range
of
1.7
cents
deduction
for
this
pipeline
cost
due
to
the
lower
quality
of
the
gas.
and
if
you'd
deduct
that
from
14.5
cents,
you're
still
above
12.72.
now,
my
method
of
--
my
approach
to
this
must
be
wrong
when
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument.
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
to
tell
me
where
and
how?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
but
that
also
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
includes
a
return.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
say
in
this
--
what
you're
saying
mr.
gillian
depends
upon
going
from
the
group
average
basis
to
the
individual
basis
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
i
guess,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
you
that
when
you
start
engaging
in
that
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
mess.
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
you
have
findings
on
that?
what
the
commission
is
doing
in
effect
is
saying
that
people
who
have
this
point
made
contacts
for
gas.
and
more
of
them
14.5
just
as
you've
said
roughly
have
to
and
--
have
to
or
reduce
a
future
contract
to
that
point.
people
have
made
contracts
at
lower
figure
and
if
the
marketplace
permits
to
make
contracts
at
a
higher
figure
than
their
previous
contract
price
up
to
14.5.
well
now,
actually
on
the
basis
of
experience
as
i
understand
this,
the
industry
revenues
may
not
be
14.5,
they're
maybe
less
than
that
rate
by
considerable
amount,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
