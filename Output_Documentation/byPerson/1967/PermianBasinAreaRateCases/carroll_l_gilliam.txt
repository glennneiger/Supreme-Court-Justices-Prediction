mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
and
mr.
stone
who
will
follow
me
appear
for
30
producer
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
unique
thus
far
before
the
court.
we
are
the
--
apparently
the
only
parties
here
who
asked
the
court
to
do
one
simple
thing
and
that
is
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
are
the
parties
within
the
producing
industry
who
are
not
petitioners
in
this
case
and
we
are
here
as
i
said
as
respondents
only.
mr.
stone
who
will
follow
me
will
discuss
our
view
as
to
the
refund
issues
and
issues
involving
section
4
(e)
of
the
act.
i
will
cover
the
issues
of
rate
design
and
the
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
limited
remand
ordered
in
this
case
is
correct.
we
believed
that
the
limited
remand
is
essential
to
have
a
lawful
area
rate
method
and
to
have
valid
rates
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
court
will
see
that
implicit
in
that
statement
is
the
fact
that
our
group
supports
the
commission
insofar
as
it
has
adopted
the
area
rate
method.
we
are
not
before
the
court
raising
special
circumstance
type
questions.
we
are
therefore
somewhat
unique
and
that
we
cannot
endorse
any
of
the
arguments
that
had
been
made
before
the
court
so
far.
we
find
ourselves
agreeing
with
the
commission
on
some
things,
agreeing
with
even
the
california
distributors
on
the
adequacy
of
supply
questions,
agreeing
with
our
fellow
producers
in
part
and
not
in
part.
so
the
safest
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
must
start
my
argument
on
a
clean
slate.
i
do
have
to
return
the
attention
of
the
court
however
to
the
items
and
issues
that
were
discussed
yesterday
and
not
today.
very
briefly
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
the
legality
of
the
use
of
group
or
area
procedures.
we
agree
with
that.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
the
dual
pricing
system.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
methods
of
data
collection,
means
of
determining
group
clause
that
were
determined
in
the
case
for
producers
and
apparently
the
means
for
determining
revenue
requirements
for
the
producing
industry.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
to
accept
the
commission's
cost
yardstick
but
to
tell
the
commission
that
having
selected
that
yardstick
the
commission
should
use
it
when
it
designs
the
rates
that
are
applicable
to
the
group.
now
this
brings
us
to
what
are
the
patent
errors
in
the
commission
opinion
that
compelled
this
result
in
the
court
of
appeals.
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
this
question
as
to
possibly
the
most
important
in
the
case.
it
is
the
question
that
if
area
rates
are
valid
under
this
statute
what
is
the
substantive
standard
as
to
what
is
a
lawful
and
valid
area
rate
on
a
group
basis.
that
of
course
is
important
in
the
permian
basin
in
this
case
in
the
second
round
of
any
future
permian
basin
case
and
it
is
the
most
critical
issue
here
in
relation
to
the
four
of
the
area
rate
cases
that
mr.
solomon
referred
to
yesterday.
if
the
standard
being
used
to
determine
the
rates
on
the
group
basis
is
a
hodgepodge
and
complete
confusion
then
those
cases
like
all
others
will
be
endless
in
the
time
of
trial.
they
will
be
endless
in
judicial
review
because
no
court
of
appeals
will
know
what
it
is
they're
supposed
to
be
reviewing
when
the
case
arrives
there.
the
court
of
appeals
solved
this
question
by
turning
to
this
court's
prior
construction
of
the
standard
in
the
natural
gas
act
principally
in
the
hope
case,
the
end
result
test.
it
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
even
though
the
commission
had
shifted
to
a
group
method
using
group
data,
the
objectives
still
was
to
come
out
with
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
applied
to
the
group
under
that
statutory
standard.
now,
some
questions
have
come
up
about
the
scope
of
review
and
so
forth.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
turned
to
hope
to
find
out
what
is
the
measure
of
judicial
review
in
a
rate
case
which
this
is.
using
that
standard,
the
court
turned
to
look
at
what
is
the
end
result
in
this
case
in
relation
to
what
is
said
in
hope.
and
here
is
the
problem.
the
end
result
in
relation
to
the
test
in
hope
is
an
unknown
today.
no
one
who
has
argued
before
this
court
including
the
distinguished
general
counsel
of
the
commission
can
tell
the
court
that
in
what
in
the
prescribed
group
rates
is
the
return
actually
allowed
or
what
clause
have
been
covered,
cushions
or
otherwise.
the
reason
is
that
the
rates
on
the
record
before
this
court
are
unknowns.
now
i
had
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
tedious
facts
as
to
what
the
commission
did
in
order
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
case.
a
number
of
counsel
have
covered
the
steps
the
commission
used
to
collect
data
to
composite
cost.
we
are
not
questioning
in
our
argument
those
steps.
what
they
did
though
was
give
the
commission
the
ingredients
to
measure
cost
and
currents
and
the
financial
requirements
for
the
industry.
now,
mr.
solomon
referred
to
the
two
types
of
cost
determinations
that
were
made.
and
i
would
make
one
blanket
general
statement
about
those
that
i
don't
think
could
be
contested.
every
single
step
involved
was
a
process
of
averaging.
they
had
questionnaires
which
we
all
answered
and
in
fact
we
cooperated
in
this
endeavor.
so
let
us
just
take
as
an
example
the
overhead
cost
of
the
company.
each
producer
who
filled
out
the
questionnaire
supplied
the
cost.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
also
acquired
unsifted
volume
data
that
is
unsifted
as
to
quality.
all
of
these
things
were
totaled
up,
volumes
are
divided
into
cost
and
you
thereby
come
out
with
an
average
cost.
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
normal
ingredients
of
a
group
type
of
rate
regulation.
the
examiner
in
the
case,
i
would
point
this
out
specifically
because
i
will
get
back
to
the
new
gas
cost,
expressly
labeled
his
new
gas
cost
as
the
average
unit
cost
at
1960
which
was
the
test
year.
i
would
refer
for
those
statements
to
the
record,
page
186
that
is
the
joint
appendix
page
221
and
257.
but
the
product
of
this
process
of
averaging
was
this
commission
yardstick.
now,
mr.
atwell
did
cover
it
earlier
and
i
won't
go
into
that
the
fact
that
the
yardstick
was
the
cost
to
the
wellhead
only.
it
did
not
include
producer
incurred
cost
beyond
that
point
which
are
cost
incurred
to
bring
gas
up
to
a
higher
quality.
but
accepting
the
wellhead
cost
figures,
there
are
two
of
significance.
on
the
new
gas
cost
16.5
cents
and
the
old
gas
cost
14.5
cents.
the
commission
then
had
these
as
the
yardsticks
to
turn
to
measure
against
that
yardstick
the
average
revenues
that
the
industry
was
then
deriving
at
the
contracts
in
effect
under
the
act.
the
record
showed
that
the
test
year
average
revenues
and
this
is
all
gas
regardless
of
age
or
quality.
the
test
year
average
revenue
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
this
was
an
approximate
collection
of
about
a
$110
million.
the
rate
structure
that
created
that
revenue
consisted
of
prices
that
were
originally
contract
that
are
now
filed
rate
schedules
under
the
act
ranging
from
as
low
as
3
cents
per
mcf
up
to
18
cents
per
mcf.
but
this
structure
of
contracts
produced
this
average
revenue
figure
of
12.72.
it
is
our
view
that
at
that
point
following
the
steps
for
testing
and
prescribing
rates
that
this
court
referred
to
in
1942
in
the
natural
gas
pipeline
case,
the
commission
should
have
then
turned
to
test
against
its
cost
figure,
the
average
cost
figure,
the
revenues
at
existing
rates.
the
commission
however
skipped
these
steps
and
went
straight
to
the
step
of
prescribing
or
designing
a
complete
new
structure
of
rates
to
replace
these
contracts
in
effect.
and
it
is
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
perhaps
the
average
revenue,
test
year
revenue
in
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
contract
prices
that
were
in
effect,
not
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
not
the
commission
prescribed
rates.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
i
can
simplify
that
by
this
statement.
the
16.5
cent
new
gas
figure
the
commission
has
prescribed
under
its
dual
price
system
would
apply
only
to
gas
sold
under
contracts
executed
after
january
1,
1961.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
so
we
leave
that
aside
because
this
1960
is
flowing
gas.
so
as
we
would
see
the
case,
the
comparison
would
be
the
14.5
cents
figure
of
cost
with
the
12.72
cents
revenue
figure.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that's
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
mr.
justice
fortas
where
you're
headed
right
now
is
one
of
the
essential
problems
in
the
case.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
alright.
the
14.5
cents
is
the
average
cost
figure
that
came
from
the
composite
cost
study.
now
we
go
to
rate
design.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
cost.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
with
the
1960
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
at
that
time.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
you're
correct
at
that
point.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
on
that
basis,
yes.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
want
to
mislead
you.
the
commission
will
contest
my
view
that
that
is
an
average
cost
and
i
must
go
into
the
next
steps
that
go
into
rate
design
under
the
commission
method.
as
we
view
the
case
what
the
commission
did
with
that
14.5
cents
average
cost
and
i
will
concentrate
on
the
argument
on
that
was
to
make
that
the
rate
applicable
to
pipeline
quality
only
the
highest
quality
under
the
quality
standards
that
they
prescribed
indicates.
the
court
of
appeals
make
the
point
that
only
10%
of
the
gas
involved
in
the
permian
basin
area
would
be
eligible
for
that
average
cost
maximum
rate
of
14.5
cents.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
12%
return?
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
is
embedded
in
the
methodology
used
to
get
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
to
the
14.5
cents.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
correct.
the
return
element
is
in
there.
i
hope
that
later
in
the
argument
to
get
to
the
questions
about
the
12%
returns.
but
i'm
talking
now
only
about
the
end
product
of
all
of
the
costing
methods.
this
is
tidying
up
everything.
and
that's
14.5
cents.
now,
as
i
said
under
the
rate
design
that
the
commission
used,
that
rate
was
used
as
the
maximum
rate,
the
pipeline
quality
only,
but
all
of
the
data
that
the
commission
had
for
average
data.
but
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
problem.
earlier,
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
the
view
that
there
is
something
in
here
for
everyone
as
the
commission
argument.
that
was
a
song
in
one
--
i
believe
some
years
ago,
that
the
title
of
the
show
was
a
funny
thing
happened
on
the
way
to
the
forum.
and
this
in
effect
is
the
problem
in
rate
design
because
the
funny
thing
happened
when
you
moved
from
the
14.5
to
the
prescribed
rates.
a
number
of
things
including
the
12%
return
fall
through
the
crack
because
the
next
step
is
to
apply
the
rate.
you
have
to
take
the
commission's
pipeline
quality
standard
and
subtract
from
that,
not
producer
cost
or
cost
which
are
in
this
record
but
pipeline
cost.
now,
this
source
of
subtraction
to
arrive
at
a
producer
rate
was
sprung
on
all
parties
to
this
case
out
of
the
blue
in
the
commission
opinion.
i
don't
believe
that
a
single
witness
on
rate
design
who
appeared
indicates
ever
conceived
that
to
design
producer
rates,
you
would
have
to
have
recourse
to
something
not
in
that
record
which
was
the
cost
incurred
by
the
pipelines
when
they
bring
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
so
when
the
commission
prescribed
the
rate
system,
you
have
to
go
to
what
is
called
the
ordering
paragraph
b
where
the
quality
standard
is
set
up.
then
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
rates
are
you
have
to
go
to
the
pipeline,
these
are
all
added
up
and
submitted
to
the
commission.
the
result
of
that
was
that
when
the
commission
entered
this
order
on
august
5,
1965,
it
did
not
know
and
could
not
have
known
what
were
the
rates
that
prescribed?
it
could
not
have
known
what
costs
were
covered.
it
could
not
have
known
what
the
actual
return
allowance
would
be.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
and
i
am
talking
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
believe
that
they
have
submitted
in
the
brief,
certainly,
on
the
court
of
appeals.
in
brief
they
submitted
some
figures
based
on
materials
they
had
at
that
time.
in
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
there
were
still
different
figures.
there
are
still
different
figures
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
we
have
questioned
them
in
our
brief.
apparently
there's
something
wrong
with
how
we
questioned
them.
i
would
be
--
assume
that
you
might
hear
still
other
figures
from
the
commission.
but
in
order
to
get
that
total
what
was
required
was
that
each
individual
producer
had
to
go
to
the
pipeline
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it's
pipeline.
there
are
three
principal
pipelines
involved.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
then
they
agree
on
these
things
and
it's
supposed
to
include
a
reasonable
return
on
investment
through
the
pipeline,
not
the
producers.
you
get
those
costs,
subtract
from
the
14.5
cents
and
you
come
out
with
a
cents
per
mcf
figure
and
that
was
filed
with
the
commission.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now,
from
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
total
impact
the
commission
was
saying
they
could
not
find.
now
it
is
correct,
now,
we'll
answer
your
question.
i
believe
the
commission
brief
here
refers
to
three
types
of
estimates.
but
there
is
no
record
basis
for
any
of
them.
while
the
commissioners
on
a
concurring
opinion
referred
to
contractual
provisions,
they
cover
differences
in
quality
and
he
had
an
estimate
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
opinion
on
rehearing
had
an
estimate
of
i
believe
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
it
was
1
cent
to
1.7
cents
per
mcf.
there
were
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
was
an
estimate
in
the
opinion
but,
your
honor,
my
point
was
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
is
no
record
basis
whatsoever
as
to
this
pipeline
cost
that
are
in
fact
used
to
subtract.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
up
to
pipeline
quality.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
so
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
pipeline
cost.
now
what
they
have
referred
to
are
three
different
things
that
are
not
the
same
thing.
there
were
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
were
producer
processing
costs
submitted
in
the
record
for
a
different
purpose.
but
the
producers'
function
in
processing
is
different
and
therefore
the
cost
involved
would
differ.
i
would
add
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
if
that
was
subtracted
from
the
14.5
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
it
would
be
in
that
range.
but
i
would
look
--
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
of
that
and
the
problem
that
it
creates
in
the
rate
case.
what
it
means
is
that
when
the
commission
got
to
the
critical
point
of
rate
designs
and
therefore
came
out
with
a
decision
which
was
subject
to
judicial
review,
the
product
still
was
an
unknown.
and
it
is
critical
in
this
sense
that
whether
the
pipeline
cost
were
in
the
record
or
not,
the
effect
of
the
rate
design
is
to
reduce
the
average
revenue
below
an
average
cost
by
using
the
average
cost
figure
as
a
maximum
rate
and
then
using
deductions
from
that.
the
total
revenue
then
would
be
derived
from
these
prescribed
rates
whatever
they
are
would
come
out
at
an
average
level
that
is
below
the
average
cost.
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
average
cost
as
we
would
see
it
in
the
case
would
be
the
14.5
cents
figure
of
flowing
gas.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that's
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
that
would
be
in
the
record.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
but
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
would
not
because
in
order
to
determine
that
in
the
case,
you
would
have
to
have
evidence
on
the
pipeline
cost.
now,
i
think
it
would
turn
from
that
to
the
corrective
steps
that
the
remand
would
contemplate.
the
examiner
in
the
case
recognized
principles
that
would
produce
a
lawful
result
and
it
starts
with
the
proposition
that
the
average
cost
in
any
case
determined
on
an
average
rate
base
method.
that
rate
is
the
fit
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
event
yesterday,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
briefly
on
a
personal
note
because
i
have
received
many
expressions
of
concerns
from
the
offices
of
the
court
and
counsel
in
the
case.
i
am
assured
on
confident
medical
advice
that
the
problem
is
a
sinus
congestion
and
not
having
availed
myself
of
proper
dining
for
the
past
two
or
three
days,
there
is
no
impediment
whatsoever
to
our
continuing
under
the
normal
rules
of
the
game.
i
would
hope
as
mark
twain
once
stated
it
that
the
trade
press
would
note
that
the
news
of
yesterday
was
greatly
exaggerated.
so
with
that
note
i
would
state
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
thank
you.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
thank
you
your
honor.
yesterday
at
the
point
of
the
unfunny
event
in
this
forum,
mr.
justice
fortas
had
propounded
a
series
of
questions
that
go
to
the
attempt
to
find
a
post
revenue
balance
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
white
had
propounded
a
series
of
questions
dealing
with
the
quality
treatment
deduction
cost.
i
would
state
that
the
answers
to
those
two
series
of
questions
actually
cannot
be
made
on
the
face
of
the
commission
decision
or
its
opinion
on
rehearing.
the
difficulty
that
i
believe
the
court
is
having
and
that
all
counsel
are
having
in
discussing
those
two
questions
is
precisely
what
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
a
normal
rate
case
whether
it
is
individual
company
or
a
group
rate
case,
the
agency
makes
findings
as
to
the
cost
that
he
is
going
to
allow
in
the
rate
and
findings
as
to
the
rates
it
is
allowing.
we
then
proceed
if
there
are
judicial
review
questions
that
these
questions
are
weld
if
they
leave
out
a
cost
or
did
they
not.
there's
one
side
of
the
other
thing,
a
cost
allowed
was
generous
or
not
generous
is
the
rate
of
return
high
or
low
under
the
hope
test.
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case
is
precisely
what
was
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
for
that
court
or
this
court
to
address
itself
to
those
questions,
there
are
certain
limited
gaps
in
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case.
now,
to
go
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
problem
with
this
revenue
costs
balance.
we
had
the
14.5
cents
cost
of
flowing
gas.
that
is
a
cost
finding
by
the
commission.
it
is
based
on
a
number
of
underlying
subsidiary
findings
as
to
each
of
the
cost
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
that.
we
are
not
attacking
that.
to
apply
the
hope
test
however,
you
have
to
compare
that
figure
with
what
is
the
average
revenue
under
the
prescribed
rates.
unfortunately,
in
this
case
in
order
to
know
what
the
prescribed
rates
are
we
need
to
know
what
is
shown
by
this
evidence
of
pipeline
cost
that
would
have
to
be
used
to
arrive
at
the
prescribed
rates.
what
the
resultant
rates
are?
make
some
multiplications
by
the
volume
sold
and
we
would
come
out
with
an
average
revenue
figure.
which
figure
should
be
the
one
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
seeking
to
compare
with
this
14.5
cent
figure?
now
yesterday,
we
had
talked
about
the
12.72
cent
figure
but
that
is
the
average
revenue
in
1960
at
all
of
the
contracts
and
rates
then
in
effect
that
includes
these
18
cent
rates.
it
include
the
whole
spectrum
of
the
3
cent
rates
and
everything
in
between
and
it
averaged
12.72.
now
under
the
prescribed
rates,
we
know
a
number
of
things.
we
know
first
of
all
that
all
of
them
in
that
batch
that
were
above
14.5
cents
are
reduced
first
to
the
14.5
cent
level.
then
on
the
rates
for
the
90%
of
the
gas
involved
in
this
case
which
is
not
eligible
for
the
pipeline
quality
rate,
the
prescribed
rates
are
lower
so
that
as
we
review
the
case
and
if
you
accept
some
of
these
estimates
of
how
much
is
this
pipeline
quality
subtraction
the
average
revenue
under
the
prescribed
rates
will
be
lower
than
the
12.72
cent
figure
that
existed
in
1960.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
think
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
you
honor
that
is
most
critical.
but
just
as
we
had
to
do
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
i
would
have
to
do,
and
as
much
as
solomon
would
have
to
do
when
he's
follows
me
to
answer
that
question.
i
have
to
go
outside
of
this
record
and
talk
about
these
materials
as
to
pipeline
cost
which
the
commission
of
course
has
now
but
they
are
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
can
answer
the
question
if
i
--
on
estimate.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
it's
the
same
type
of
estimate
that
you
asked
me
about
yesterday.
if
you
accept
a
lower
figure
that
i
believe
the
commission
has
in
it's
brief
now
lower
than
1.7,
at
one
point
in
their
brief
here,
they
say
that
on
examining
the
statements
they
have,
if
the
range
would
be
between
one
and
2
cents
and
in
another
place
they
say
something
like
1.1
to
one
category
of
gas
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
alright.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
commission
found
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
recommend
--
i
don't
think
there
is
one
but
mr.
solomon
make
the
supply
you
want.
the
commission
did
make
a
finding
that
included
the
1.7
figure
that
mr.
justice
fortas
mentioned.
it
did
not
make
specific
findings
on
this
pipeline
quality
material
which
i
think
maybe
the
source
of
a
material
before
you.
the
estimates
that
the
commission
made
were
not
based
upon
the
pipeline
cost
data
at
all.
they
were
based
upon
what
we
considered
totally
unrelated
evidence
as
to
producer
cost
and
the
provisions
in
existing
contracts
that
are
addressed
to
this
quality
differential.
well,
they
rejected
this
contract
approached
as
mr.
merrill
covered
yesterday.
but
let
me
get
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
if
we
take
--
let's
take
the
1.5
cent
figure
instead
of
1.7.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
just
assume
that
it
is
1.5.
the
subtraction
that
you
have
to
make
in
applying
this
designed
rate
here
is
not
from
the
14.5
cent
cost
figure.
that
is
a
commission
finding
on
producer
cost
only
of
a
revenue
requirement.
when
you
design
rates
the
subtraction
is
made
over
on
the
revenue
side
not
the
cost
side.
you
don't
subtract
--
let's
say
this,
the
14.5
cents
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
is
the
average
cost.
now,
the
commission
has
found
that
it
does
that
on
cost
of
service
methods
in
every
case,
in
every
regulatory
agency
that
uses
this
method
makes
that
finding
that
that's
the
product
of
a
cost
to
service,
an
average
cost
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
includes
a
return
and
i
hope
to
get
that.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
1.5
cents
is
not
subtracted
from
the
cost
that
have
to
be
compared.
it
is
subtracted
from
the
rates
that
are
prescribed.
the
maximum
pipeline
quality
gets
the
14.5
cents
in
revenue,
so
you
have
a
cost
revenue
balance
assuming
that.
but
on
the
other
90%
of
the
gas
you
have
to
make
the
subtractions
which,
let
assume,
the
average
1.5.
you
subtract
that,
you
come
down
to
what
the
revenue
is
for
that
90%
of
the
gas
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
your
honor,
we
--
we're
like
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believed
that
with
these
corrections
the
area
rate
method
is
not
a
mess,
it
can
be
made
a
viable,
workable,
regulatory
method.
but
i'm
not
talking
about
individual
company
figures
in
any
of
my
discussion
this
morning.
i'm
talking
about
the
aggregate.
this
is
most
unlike
the
questions
this
court
had
in
the
chicago
v.
atchison
case
last
term.
i'm
not
talking
about
individual
company
findings.
i'm
talking
about
the
aggregate
cost
filed
on
this
composite
industry
basis
and
the
aggregate
industry
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
is
the
latter
that
we
don't
have
the
necessary
findings
to
make
this
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
--
they
can
be
under
given
set
of
facts
and
the
test
year
and
it
could
happen
in
this
case
from
1960.
but
that
has
very
great
legal
significance
in
rate
regulations.
if
the
combination
of
all
of
these
contracts
produced
an
average
revenue
that
is
below
the
average
revenue
requirement,
it
means
that
you
can't
say
that
the
rates,
the
totality
of
revenue
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
commission
is
closed
from
looking
at
the
spectrum
and
saying
that
this
is
discriminatory
and
so
on.
but
that
the
first
step
in
a
rate
case
before
you
start
to
design
the
rates
to
be
placed
in
effect
is
this
cost
revenue
balance.
now,
once
you
make
that
and
if
the
commission
filed
as
it
could
find
in
any
case,
yes,
the
industry
revenue
is
excessive.
what
is
the
next
step?
it
is
to
design
a
structural
rates
and
even
in
this
case,
there's
no
single
uniform
rate.
the
commission
has
designed
a
structure
of
differing
rates.
but
mr.
justice
fortas
when
they
imposed
it,
it
automatically
sets
aside
the
contract
prices
and
this
is
imposed
in
lieu
of
that
but
it
still
as
we
see
the
majority
opinion
in
hope
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
concluded.
it
means
that
even
under
the
group
method
the
revenue
--
the
average
revenue
under
that
spectrum
of
rates
should
at
least
be
such
that
the
industry
has
the
opportunity
and
i
emphasize
opportunity
because
this
doesn't
guarantee
anything,
its
opportunity,
to
earn
the
average
cost.
its
average
revenue,
average
cost.
now,
on
--
included
as
your
honor
said
is
this
12%
rate
of
return.
that
is
a
piece
that
makes
up
the
14.5
cent
cost.
it
is
significant
in
this
case
because
the
commission
says,
“well,
even
though
you
may
not
have
gotten
a
balance,
you
certainly
didn't
get
the
14.5
cent
cost,
therefore
you
didn't
get
the
14
--
the
12%
return
but
that
was
kind
of
generous,
so
what?”
to
apply
the
hope
test
and
for
a
court
to
review
a
rate
case
it
is
not
reviewing
a
hypothetical
12%
return
or
something
else.
the
court
has
to
know
what
is
the
return
that
was
allowed,
right?
doesn't
make
any
difference.
if
i
stand
up
here
and
tell
you
that
the
12%
is
too
low
and
somebody
else
says
it's
too
high,
if
that
isn't
what
is
allowed
in
this
rate,
what
difference
does
it
make
out?
there's
no
point
in
wasting
the
time
of
the
court.
what
we
should
be
talking
about
is
the
12
--
it
is
not
the
12%
but
what
was
the
return
allowed
in
the
rates
prescribed?
now,
the
12
may
sound
high
but
there's
a
significant
reason
for
that
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
difference
in
the
equity
debt
ratio
in
the
producing
industry
with
ordinary
utilities.
the
court's
were
accustomed
to
hearing
6%
and
times
passed
and
that
seems
to
be
the
sacrosanct
magic
number.
but
just
as
a
hypothetical
example,
in
pipelines
and
in
most
utilities
the
equity
is
usually
only
about
15%
of
the
total
capital.
the
rest
of
the
total
capital
is
debt
but
at
least
until
times
recently
the
companies
that
get
is
4.5%
or
something
along
that
line
4.5
to
5.
it
certainly
is
not
possible
today.
but
assume
that
in
my
example
when
they
allow
6%
on
the
total
capitalization,
it
means
that
the
equity
gets
9
to
10%
and
on
page
144
of
the
commission's
brief
they
correctly
state
that,
“in
recent
pipeline
cases,
they
have
allowed
and
this
is
based
on
evidence
about
the
market
cost
money
and
so
forth.
rates
of
return
that
permitted
pipeline
equity
that
earn
10
to
12%
on
the
equity.”
now,
let
me
shift
from
that
to
the
producer
situation.
the
commission
made
finding
at
the
finding
in
the
rate
of
return
part
of
its
opinion
that
an
equity
investment
in
a
producing
company
is
far
riskier
than
this
pipeline
equity
investment.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
party
to
the
case
and
that
would
include
the
commission
staff
who
disagrees
with
that.
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
riskiest
investments
that
anyone
could
make.
and
this
brings
me
right
back
to
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
producers
have
an
85%
equity,
it's
this
simple,
you
can't
finance
the
bulk
of
exploration
by
going
to
a
bank
and
conservative
institutions.
it
has
to
be
done
with
equity
money.
and
that
it
has
to
be
primarily
generated
internally
through
the
rates
collected.
but
let
me
get
to
the
mathematics
of
this
12%
return.
the
commission
in
its
brief
has
these
numbers
that
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out.
if
you
apply
that
both
in
this
case
the
effect
of
it
is
to
reduce
this
12%
to
something
on
the
order
of
9.5
or
9
or
10
or
somewhere
in
there.
but
what
that
does
to
the
producer
equity
in
this
case,
if
that
is
correct,
is
to
reduce
the
allowed
return
to
the
producer
equity
below
that
or
certainly
no
higher
than
that,
that
the
commission
is
allowing
on
the
pipeline
case
equity
and
other
cases.
and
yet
in
the
rate
or
return
part
of
this
decision
there
is
finding
at
the
finding
that
the
producer
equity
is
riskier.
now,
of
course
no
one
asked
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
pick
12,
9,
10
or
anything.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
cost
of
this
pipeline
quality
thing,
first
of
all
there
is
the
procedural
error,
it
isn't
in
the
record,
we
can't
quantify
in
the
court.
it
does
have
the
effect
of
reducing
this
cost
revenue
balance.
it
obviously
has
this
effect
on
the
allow
of
return.
we
can't
fill
those
gaps
or
speculate.
it
is
a
function
of
the
commission
to
make
the
additional
findings.
now,
just
briefly,
this
limited
remand
somebody
said
yesterday
that
it
could
take
forever.
it
is
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
it
would
be
true
under
any
limited
remand.
by
this
court
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
a
practical
matter
would
contemplate
getting
into
this
record.
these
pipeline
quality
and
cost
data
that
they
have
and
adjusting
the
findings.
and
i
think
in
the
essence
that
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
asking.
they
certainly
have
not
discarded
this
record.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
and
mr.
stone
who
will
follow
me
appear
for
30
producer
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
unique
thus
far
before
the
court.
we
are
the
--
apparently
the
only
parties
here
who
asked
the
court
to
do
one
simple
thing
and
that
is
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
are
the
parties
within
the
producing
industry
who
are
not
petitioners
in
this
case
and
we
are
here
as
i
said
as
respondents
only.
mr.
stone
who
will
follow
me
will
discuss
our
view
as
to
the
refund
issues
and
issues
involving
section
4
(e)
of
the
act.
i
will
cover
the
issues
of
rate
design
and
the
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
limited
remand
ordered
in
this
case
is
correct.
we
believed
that
the
limited
remand
is
essential
to
have
a
lawful
area
rate
method
and
to
have
valid
rates
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
court
will
see
that
implicit
in
that
statement
is
the
fact
that
our
group
supports
the
commission
insofar
as
it
has
adopted
the
area
rate
method.
we
are
not
before
the
court
raising
special
circumstance
type
questions.
we
are
therefore
somewhat
unique
and
that
we
cannot
endorse
any
of
the
arguments
that
had
been
made
before
the
court
so
far.
we
find
ourselves
agreeing
with
the
commission
on
some
things,
agreeing
with
even
the
california
distributors
on
the
adequacy
of
supply
questions,
agreeing
with
our
fellow
producers
in
part
and
not
in
part.
so
the
safest
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
must
start
my
argument
on
a
clean
slate.
i
do
have
to
return
the
attention
of
the
court
however
to
the
items
and
issues
that
were
discussed
yesterday
and
not
today.
very
briefly
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
the
legality
of
the
use
of
group
or
area
procedures.
we
agree
with
that.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
the
dual
pricing
system.
it
did
not
reverse
the
commission
as
to
methods
of
data
collection,
means
of
determining
group
clause
that
were
determined
in
the
case
for
producers
and
apparently
the
means
for
determining
revenue
requirements
for
the
producing
industry.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
to
accept
the
commission's
cost
yardstick
but
to
tell
the
commission
that
having
selected
that
yardstick
the
commission
should
use
it
when
it
designs
the
rates
that
are
applicable
to
the
group.
now
this
brings
us
to
what
are
the
patent
errors
in
the
commission
opinion
that
compelled
this
result
in
the
court
of
appeals.
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
this
question
as
to
possibly
the
most
important
in
the
case.
it
is
the
question
that
if
area
rates
are
valid
under
this
statute
what
is
the
substantive
standard
as
to
what
is
a
lawful
and
valid
area
rate
on
a
group
basis.
that
of
course
is
important
in
the
permian
basin
in
this
case
in
the
second
round
of
any
future
permian
basin
case
and
it
is
the
most
critical
issue
here
in
relation
to
the
four
of
the
area
rate
cases
that
mr.
solomon
referred
to
yesterday.
if
the
standard
being
used
to
determine
the
rates
on
the
group
basis
is
a
hodgepodge
and
complete
confusion
then
those
cases
like
all
others
will
be
endless
in
the
time
of
trial.
they
will
be
endless
in
judicial
review
because
no
court
of
appeals
will
know
what
it
is
they're
supposed
to
be
reviewing
when
the
case
arrives
there.
the
court
of
appeals
solved
this
question
by
turning
to
this
court's
prior
construction
of
the
standard
in
the
natural
gas
act
principally
in
the
hope
case,
the
end
result
test.
it
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
even
though
the
commission
had
shifted
to
a
group
method
using
group
data,
the
objectives
still
was
to
come
out
with
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
applied
to
the
group
under
that
statutory
standard.
now,
some
questions
have
come
up
about
the
scope
of
review
and
so
forth.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
turned
to
hope
to
find
out
what
is
the
measure
of
judicial
review
in
a
rate
case
which
this
is.
using
that
standard,
the
court
turned
to
look
at
what
is
the
end
result
in
this
case
in
relation
to
what
is
said
in
hope.
and
here
is
the
problem.
the
end
result
in
relation
to
the
test
in
hope
is
an
unknown
today.
no
one
who
has
argued
before
this
court
including
the
distinguished
general
counsel
of
the
commission
can
tell
the
court
that
in
what
in
the
prescribed
group
rates
is
the
return
actually
allowed
or
what
clause
have
been
covered,
cushions
or
otherwise.
the
reason
is
that
the
rates
on
the
record
before
this
court
are
unknowns.
now
i
had
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
tedious
facts
as
to
what
the
commission
did
in
order
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
case.
a
number
of
counsel
have
covered
the
steps
the
commission
used
to
collect
data
to
composite
cost.
we
are
not
questioning
in
our
argument
those
steps.
what
they
did
though
was
give
the
commission
the
ingredients
to
measure
cost
and
currents
and
the
financial
requirements
for
the
industry.
now,
mr.
solomon
referred
to
the
two
types
of
cost
determinations
that
were
made.
and
i
would
make
one
blanket
general
statement
about
those
that
i
don't
think
could
be
contested.
every
single
step
involved
was
a
process
of
averaging.
they
had
questionnaires
which
we
all
answered
and
in
fact
we
cooperated
in
this
endeavor.
so
let
us
just
take
as
an
example
the
overhead
cost
of
the
company.
each
producer
who
filled
out
the
questionnaire
supplied
the
cost.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
also
acquired
unsifted
volume
data
that
is
unsifted
as
to
quality.
all
of
these
things
were
totaled
up,
volumes
are
divided
into
cost
and
you
thereby
come
out
with
an
average
cost.
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
normal
ingredients
of
a
group
type
of
rate
regulation.
the
examiner
in
the
case,
i
would
point
this
out
specifically
because
i
will
get
back
to
the
new
gas
cost,
expressly
labeled
his
new
gas
cost
as
the
average
unit
cost
at
1960
which
was
the
test
year.
i
would
refer
for
those
statements
to
the
record,
page
186
that
is
the
joint
appendix
page
221
and
257.
but
the
product
of
this
process
of
averaging
was
this
commission
yardstick.
now,
mr.
atwell
did
cover
it
earlier
and
i
won't
go
into
that
the
fact
that
the
yardstick
was
the
cost
to
the
wellhead
only.
it
did
not
include
producer
incurred
cost
beyond
that
point
which
are
cost
incurred
to
bring
gas
up
to
a
higher
quality.
but
accepting
the
wellhead
cost
figures,
there
are
two
of
significance.
on
the
new
gas
cost
16.5
cents
and
the
old
gas
cost
14.5
cents.
the
commission
then
had
these
as
the
yardsticks
to
turn
to
measure
against
that
yardstick
the
average
revenues
that
the
industry
was
then
deriving
at
the
contracts
in
effect
under
the
act.
the
record
showed
that
the
test
year
average
revenues
and
this
is
all
gas
regardless
of
age
or
quality.
the
test
year
average
revenue
was
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
this
was
an
approximate
collection
of
about
a
$110
million.
the
rate
structure
that
created
that
revenue
consisted
of
prices
that
were
originally
contract
that
are
now
filed
rate
schedules
under
the
act
ranging
from
as
low
as
3
cents
per
mcf
up
to
18
cents
per
mcf.
but
this
structure
of
contracts
produced
this
average
revenue
figure
of
12.72.
it
is
our
view
that
at
that
point
following
the
steps
for
testing
and
prescribing
rates
that
this
court
referred
to
in
1942
in
the
natural
gas
pipeline
case,
the
commission
should
have
then
turned
to
test
against
its
cost
figure,
the
average
cost
figure,
the
revenues
at
existing
rates.
the
commission
however
skipped
these
steps
and
went
straight
to
the
step
of
prescribing
or
designing
a
complete
new
structure
of
rates
to
replace
these
contracts
in
effect.
and
it
is
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
perhaps
the
average
revenue,
test
year
revenue
in
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
contract
prices
that
were
in
effect,
not
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
not
the
commission
prescribed
rates.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
12.72
cents
per
mcf.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
i
can
simplify
that
by
this
statement.
the
16.5
cent
new
gas
figure
the
commission
has
prescribed
under
its
dual
price
system
would
apply
only
to
gas
sold
under
contracts
executed
after
january
1,
1961.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
so
we
leave
that
aside
because
this
1960
is
flowing
gas.
so
as
we
would
see
the
case,
the
comparison
would
be
the
14.5
cents
figure
of
cost
with
the
12.72
cents
revenue
figure.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that's
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
mr.
justice
fortas
where
you're
headed
right
now
is
one
of
the
essential
problems
in
the
case.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
alright.
the
14.5
cents
is
the
average
cost
figure
that
came
from
the
composite
cost
study.
now
we
go
to
rate
design.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
average
cost.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
with
the
1960
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
at
that
time.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
you're
correct
at
that
point.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
on
that
basis,
yes.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
want
to
mislead
you.
the
commission
will
contest
my
view
that
that
is
an
average
cost
and
i
must
go
into
the
next
steps
that
go
into
rate
design
under
the
commission
method.
as
we
view
the
case
what
the
commission
did
with
that
14.5
cents
average
cost
and
i
will
concentrate
on
the
argument
on
that
was
to
make
that
the
rate
applicable
to
pipeline
quality
only
the
highest
quality
under
the
quality
standards
that
they
prescribed
indicates.
the
court
of
appeals
make
the
point
that
only
10%
of
the
gas
involved
in
the
permian
basin
area
would
be
eligible
for
that
average
cost
maximum
rate
of
14.5
cents.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
12%
return?
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
is
embedded
in
the
methodology
used
to
get
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
to
the
14.5
cents.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
correct.
the
return
element
is
in
there.
i
hope
that
later
in
the
argument
to
get
to
the
questions
about
the
12%
returns.
but
i'm
talking
now
only
about
the
end
product
of
all
of
the
costing
methods.
this
is
tidying
up
everything.
and
that's
14.5
cents.
now,
as
i
said
under
the
rate
design
that
the
commission
used,
that
rate
was
used
as
the
maximum
rate,
the
pipeline
quality
only,
but
all
of
the
data
that
the
commission
had
for
average
data.
but
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
problem.
earlier,
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
the
view
that
there
is
something
in
here
for
everyone
as
the
commission
argument.
that
was
a
song
in
one
--
i
believe
some
years
ago,
that
the
title
of
the
show
was
a
funny
thing
happened
on
the
way
to
the
forum.
and
this
in
effect
is
the
problem
in
rate
design
because
the
funny
thing
happened
when
you
moved
from
the
14.5
to
the
prescribed
rates.
a
number
of
things
including
the
12%
return
fall
through
the
crack
because
the
next
step
is
to
apply
the
rate.
you
have
to
take
the
commission's
pipeline
quality
standard
and
subtract
from
that,
not
producer
cost
or
cost
which
are
in
this
record
but
pipeline
cost.
now,
this
source
of
subtraction
to
arrive
at
a
producer
rate
was
sprung
on
all
parties
to
this
case
out
of
the
blue
in
the
commission
opinion.
i
don't
believe
that
a
single
witness
on
rate
design
who
appeared
indicates
ever
conceived
that
to
design
producer
rates,
you
would
have
to
have
recourse
to
something
not
in
that
record
which
was
the
cost
incurred
by
the
pipelines
when
they
bring
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
so
when
the
commission
prescribed
the
rate
system,
you
have
to
go
to
what
is
called
the
ordering
paragraph
b
where
the
quality
standard
is
set
up.
then
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
rates
are
you
have
to
go
to
the
pipeline,
these
are
all
added
up
and
submitted
to
the
commission.
the
result
of
that
was
that
when
the
commission
entered
this
order
on
august
5,
1965,
it
did
not
know
and
could
not
have
known
what
were
the
rates
that
prescribed?
it
could
not
have
known
what
costs
were
covered.
it
could
not
have
known
what
the
actual
return
allowance
would
be.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
and
i
am
talking
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
believe
that
they
have
submitted
in
the
brief,
certainly,
on
the
court
of
appeals.
in
brief
they
submitted
some
figures
based
on
materials
they
had
at
that
time.
in
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
there
were
still
different
figures.
there
are
still
different
figures
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
we
have
questioned
them
in
our
brief.
apparently
there's
something
wrong
with
how
we
questioned
them.
i
would
be
--
assume
that
you
might
hear
still
other
figures
from
the
commission.
but
in
order
to
get
that
total
what
was
required
was
that
each
individual
producer
had
to
go
to
the
pipeline
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it's
pipeline.
there
are
three
principal
pipelines
involved.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
then
they
agree
on
these
things
and
it's
supposed
to
include
a
reasonable
return
on
investment
through
the
pipeline,
not
the
producers.
you
get
those
costs,
subtract
from
the
14.5
cents
and
you
come
out
with
a
cents
per
mcf
figure
and
that
was
filed
with
the
commission.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now,
from
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
total
impact
the
commission
was
saying
they
could
not
find.
now
it
is
correct,
now,
we'll
answer
your
question.
i
believe
the
commission
brief
here
refers
to
three
types
of
estimates.
but
there
is
no
record
basis
for
any
of
them.
while
the
commissioners
on
a
concurring
opinion
referred
to
contractual
provisions,
they
cover
differences
in
quality
and
he
had
an
estimate
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
opinion
on
rehearing
had
an
estimate
of
i
believe
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
it
was
1
cent
to
1.7
cents
per
mcf.
there
were
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
was
an
estimate
in
the
opinion
but,
your
honor,
my
point
was
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
is
no
record
basis
whatsoever
as
to
this
pipeline
cost
that
are
in
fact
used
to
subtract.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
up
to
pipeline
quality.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
so
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
pipeline
cost.
now
what
they
have
referred
to
are
three
different
things
that
are
not
the
same
thing.
there
were
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
were
producer
processing
costs
submitted
in
the
record
for
a
different
purpose.
but
the
producers'
function
in
processing
is
different
and
therefore
the
cost
involved
would
differ.
i
would
add
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
if
that
was
subtracted
from
the
14.5
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
--
it
would
be
in
that
range.
but
i
would
look
--
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
of
that
and
the
problem
that
it
creates
in
the
rate
case.
what
it
means
is
that
when
the
commission
got
to
the
critical
point
of
rate
designs
and
therefore
came
out
with
a
decision
which
was
subject
to
judicial
review,
the
product
still
was
an
unknown.
and
it
is
critical
in
this
sense
that
whether
the
pipeline
cost
were
in
the
record
or
not,
the
effect
of
the
rate
design
is
to
reduce
the
average
revenue
below
an
average
cost
by
using
the
average
cost
figure
as
a
maximum
rate
and
then
using
deductions
from
that.
the
total
revenue
then
would
be
derived
from
these
prescribed
rates
whatever
they
are
would
come
out
at
an
average
level
that
is
below
the
average
cost.
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
average
cost
as
we
would
see
it
in
the
case
would
be
the
14.5
cents
figure
of
flowing
gas.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that's
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
that
would
be
in
the
record.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
but
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
would
not
because
in
order
to
determine
that
in
the
case,
you
would
have
to
have
evidence
on
the
pipeline
cost.
now,
i
think
it
would
turn
from
that
to
the
corrective
steps
that
the
remand
would
contemplate.
the
examiner
in
the
case
recognized
principles
that
would
produce
a
lawful
result
and
it
starts
with
the
proposition
that
the
average
cost
in
any
case
determined
on
an
average
rate
base
method.
that
rate
is
the
fit
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
event
yesterday,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
briefly
on
a
personal
note
because
i
have
received
many
expressions
of
concerns
from
the
offices
of
the
court
and
counsel
in
the
case.
i
am
assured
on
confident
medical
advice
that
the
problem
is
a
sinus
congestion
and
not
having
availed
myself
of
proper
dining
for
the
past
two
or
three
days,
there
is
no
impediment
whatsoever
to
our
continuing
under
the
normal
rules
of
the
game.
i
would
hope
as
mark
twain
once
stated
it
that
the
trade
press
would
note
that
the
news
of
yesterday
was
greatly
exaggerated.
so
with
that
note
i
would
state
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
thank
you.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
thank
you
your
honor.
yesterday
at
the
point
of
the
unfunny
event
in
this
forum,
mr.
justice
fortas
had
propounded
a
series
of
questions
that
go
to
the
attempt
to
find
a
post
revenue
balance
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
white
had
propounded
a
series
of
questions
dealing
with
the
quality
treatment
deduction
cost.
i
would
state
that
the
answers
to
those
two
series
of
questions
actually
cannot
be
made
on
the
face
of
the
commission
decision
or
its
opinion
on
rehearing.
the
difficulty
that
i
believe
the
court
is
having
and
that
all
counsel
are
having
in
discussing
those
two
questions
is
precisely
what
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
a
normal
rate
case
whether
it
is
individual
company
or
a
group
rate
case,
the
agency
makes
findings
as
to
the
cost
that
he
is
going
to
allow
in
the
rate
and
findings
as
to
the
rates
it
is
allowing.
we
then
proceed
if
there
are
judicial
review
questions
that
these
questions
are
weld
if
they
leave
out
a
cost
or
did
they
not.
there's
one
side
of
the
other
thing,
a
cost
allowed
was
generous
or
not
generous
is
the
rate
of
return
high
or
low
under
the
hope
test.
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case
is
precisely
what
was
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
for
that
court
or
this
court
to
address
itself
to
those
questions,
there
are
certain
limited
gaps
in
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case.
now,
to
go
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
problem
with
this
revenue
costs
balance.
we
had
the
14.5
cents
cost
of
flowing
gas.
that
is
a
cost
finding
by
the
commission.
it
is
based
on
a
number
of
underlying
subsidiary
findings
as
to
each
of
the
cost
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
that.
we
are
not
attacking
that.
to
apply
the
hope
test
however,
you
have
to
compare
that
figure
with
what
is
the
average
revenue
under
the
prescribed
rates.
unfortunately,
in
this
case
in
order
to
know
what
the
prescribed
rates
are
we
need
to
know
what
is
shown
by
this
evidence
of
pipeline
cost
that
would
have
to
be
used
to
arrive
at
the
prescribed
rates.
what
the
resultant
rates
are?
make
some
multiplications
by
the
volume
sold
and
we
would
come
out
with
an
average
revenue
figure.
which
figure
should
be
the
one
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
seeking
to
compare
with
this
14.5
cent
figure?
now
yesterday,
we
had
talked
about
the
12.72
cent
figure
but
that
is
the
average
revenue
in
1960
at
all
of
the
contracts
and
rates
then
in
effect
that
includes
these
18
cent
rates.
it
include
the
whole
spectrum
of
the
3
cent
rates
and
everything
in
between
and
it
averaged
12.72.
now
under
the
prescribed
rates,
we
know
a
number
of
things.
we
know
first
of
all
that
all
of
them
in
that
batch
that
were
above
14.5
cents
are
reduced
first
to
the
14.5
cent
level.
then
on
the
rates
for
the
90%
of
the
gas
involved
in
this
case
which
is
not
eligible
for
the
pipeline
quality
rate,
the
prescribed
rates
are
lower
so
that
as
we
review
the
case
and
if
you
accept
some
of
these
estimates
of
how
much
is
this
pipeline
quality
subtraction
the
average
revenue
under
the
prescribed
rates
will
be
lower
than
the
12.72
cent
figure
that
existed
in
1960.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
think
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
you
honor
that
is
most
critical.
but
just
as
we
had
to
do
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
i
would
have
to
do,
and
as
much
as
solomon
would
have
to
do
when
he's
follows
me
to
answer
that
question.
i
have
to
go
outside
of
this
record
and
talk
about
these
materials
as
to
pipeline
cost
which
the
commission
of
course
has
now
but
they
are
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
can
answer
the
question
if
i
--
on
estimate.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
it's
the
same
type
of
estimate
that
you
asked
me
about
yesterday.
if
you
accept
a
lower
figure
that
i
believe
the
commission
has
in
it's
brief
now
lower
than
1.7,
at
one
point
in
their
brief
here,
they
say
that
on
examining
the
statements
they
have,
if
the
range
would
be
between
one
and
2
cents
and
in
another
place
they
say
something
like
1.1
to
one
category
of
gas
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
alright.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
commission
found
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
recommend
--
i
don't
think
there
is
one
but
mr.
solomon
make
the
supply
you
want.
the
commission
did
make
a
finding
that
included
the
1.7
figure
that
mr.
justice
fortas
mentioned.
it
did
not
make
specific
findings
on
this
pipeline
quality
material
which
i
think
maybe
the
source
of
a
material
before
you.
the
estimates
that
the
commission
made
were
not
based
upon
the
pipeline
cost
data
at
all.
they
were
based
upon
what
we
considered
totally
unrelated
evidence
as
to
producer
cost
and
the
provisions
in
existing
contracts
that
are
addressed
to
this
quality
differential.
well,
they
rejected
this
contract
approached
as
mr.
merrill
covered
yesterday.
but
let
me
get
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
if
we
take
--
let's
take
the
1.5
cent
figure
instead
of
1.7.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
just
assume
that
it
is
1.5.
the
subtraction
that
you
have
to
make
in
applying
this
designed
rate
here
is
not
from
the
14.5
cent
cost
figure.
that
is
a
commission
finding
on
producer
cost
only
of
a
revenue
requirement.
when
you
design
rates
the
subtraction
is
made
over
on
the
revenue
side
not
the
cost
side.
you
don't
subtract
--
let's
say
this,
the
14.5
cents
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
is
the
average
cost.
now,
the
commission
has
found
that
it
does
that
on
cost
of
service
methods
in
every
case,
in
every
regulatory
agency
that
uses
this
method
makes
that
finding
that
that's
the
product
of
a
cost
to
service,
an
average
cost
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
includes
a
return
and
i
hope
to
get
that.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
1.5
cents
is
not
subtracted
from
the
cost
that
have
to
be
compared.
it
is
subtracted
from
the
rates
that
are
prescribed.
the
maximum
pipeline
quality
gets
the
14.5
cents
in
revenue,
so
you
have
a
cost
revenue
balance
assuming
that.
but
on
the
other
90%
of
the
gas
you
have
to
make
the
subtractions
which,
let
assume,
the
average
1.5.
you
subtract
that,
you
come
down
to
what
the
revenue
is
for
that
90%
of
the
gas
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
your
honor,
we
--
we're
like
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believed
that
with
these
corrections
the
area
rate
method
is
not
a
mess,
it
can
be
made
a
viable,
workable,
regulatory
method.
but
i'm
not
talking
about
individual
company
figures
in
any
of
my
discussion
this
morning.
i'm
talking
about
the
aggregate.
this
is
most
unlike
the
questions
this
court
had
in
the
chicago
v.
atchison
case
last
term.
i'm
not
talking
about
individual
company
findings.
i'm
talking
about
the
aggregate
cost
filed
on
this
composite
industry
basis
and
the
aggregate
industry
revenue.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
is
the
latter
that
we
don't
have
the
necessary
findings
to
make
this
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
it
--
they
can
be
under
given
set
of
facts
and
the
test
year
and
it
could
happen
in
this
case
from
1960.
but
that
has
very
great
legal
significance
in
rate
regulations.
if
the
combination
of
all
of
these
contracts
produced
an
average
revenue
that
is
below
the
average
revenue
requirement,
it
means
that
you
can't
say
that
the
rates,
the
totality
of
revenue
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
commission
is
closed
from
looking
at
the
spectrum
and
saying
that
this
is
discriminatory
and
so
on.
but
that
the
first
step
in
a
rate
case
before
you
start
to
design
the
rates
to
be
placed
in
effect
is
this
cost
revenue
balance.
now,
once
you
make
that
and
if
the
commission
filed
as
it
could
find
in
any
case,
yes,
the
industry
revenue
is
excessive.
what
is
the
next
step?
it
is
to
design
a
structural
rates
and
even
in
this
case,
there's
no
single
uniform
rate.
the
commission
has
designed
a
structure
of
differing
rates.
but
mr.
justice
fortas
when
they
imposed
it,
it
automatically
sets
aside
the
contract
prices
and
this
is
imposed
in
lieu
of
that
but
it
still
as
we
see
the
majority
opinion
in
hope
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
concluded.
it
means
that
even
under
the
group
method
the
revenue
--
the
average
revenue
under
that
spectrum
of
rates
should
at
least
be
such
that
the
industry
has
the
opportunity
and
i
emphasize
opportunity
because
this
doesn't
guarantee
anything,
its
opportunity,
to
earn
the
average
cost.
its
average
revenue,
average
cost.
now,
on
--
included
as
your
honor
said
is
this
12%
rate
of
return.
that
is
a
piece
that
makes
up
the
14.5
cent
cost.
it
is
significant
in
this
case
because
the
commission
says,
“well,
even
though
you
may
not
have
gotten
a
balance,
you
certainly
didn't
get
the
14.5
cent
cost,
therefore
you
didn't
get
the
14
--
the
12%
return
but
that
was
kind
of
generous,
so
what?”
to
apply
the
hope
test
and
for
a
court
to
review
a
rate
case
it
is
not
reviewing
a
hypothetical
12%
return
or
something
else.
the
court
has
to
know
what
is
the
return
that
was
allowed,
right?
doesn't
make
any
difference.
if
i
stand
up
here
and
tell
you
that
the
12%
is
too
low
and
somebody
else
says
it's
too
high,
if
that
isn't
what
is
allowed
in
this
rate,
what
difference
does
it
make
out?
there's
no
point
in
wasting
the
time
of
the
court.
what
we
should
be
talking
about
is
the
12
--
it
is
not
the
12%
but
what
was
the
return
allowed
in
the
rates
prescribed?
now,
the
12
may
sound
high
but
there's
a
significant
reason
for
that
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
difference
in
the
equity
debt
ratio
in
the
producing
industry
with
ordinary
utilities.
the
court's
were
accustomed
to
hearing
6%
and
times
passed
and
that
seems
to
be
the
sacrosanct
magic
number.
but
just
as
a
hypothetical
example,
in
pipelines
and
in
most
utilities
the
equity
is
usually
only
about
15%
of
the
total
capital.
the
rest
of
the
total
capital
is
debt
but
at
least
until
times
recently
the
companies
that
get
is
4.5%
or
something
along
that
line
4.5
to
5.
it
certainly
is
not
possible
today.
but
assume
that
in
my
example
when
they
allow
6%
on
the
total
capitalization,
it
means
that
the
equity
gets
9
to
10%
and
on
page
144
of
the
commission's
brief
they
correctly
state
that,
“in
recent
pipeline
cases,
they
have
allowed
and
this
is
based
on
evidence
about
the
market
cost
money
and
so
forth.
rates
of
return
that
permitted
pipeline
equity
that
earn
10
to
12%
on
the
equity.”
now,
let
me
shift
from
that
to
the
producer
situation.
the
commission
made
finding
at
the
finding
in
the
rate
of
return
part
of
its
opinion
that
an
equity
investment
in
a
producing
company
is
far
riskier
than
this
pipeline
equity
investment.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
party
to
the
case
and
that
would
include
the
commission
staff
who
disagrees
with
that.
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
riskiest
investments
that
anyone
could
make.
and
this
brings
me
right
back
to
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
producers
have
an
85%
equity,
it's
this
simple,
you
can't
finance
the
bulk
of
exploration
by
going
to
a
bank
and
conservative
institutions.
it
has
to
be
done
with
equity
money.
and
that
it
has
to
be
primarily
generated
internally
through
the
rates
collected.
but
let
me
get
to
the
mathematics
of
this
12%
return.
the
commission
in
its
brief
has
these
numbers
that
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out.
if
you
apply
that
both
in
this
case
the
effect
of
it
is
to
reduce
this
12%
to
something
on
the
order
of
9.5
or
9
or
10
or
somewhere
in
there.
but
what
that
does
to
the
producer
equity
in
this
case,
if
that
is
correct,
is
to
reduce
the
allowed
return
to
the
producer
equity
below
that
or
certainly
no
higher
than
that,
that
the
commission
is
allowing
on
the
pipeline
case
equity
and
other
cases.
and
yet
in
the
rate
or
return
part
of
this
decision
there
is
finding
at
the
finding
that
the
producer
equity
is
riskier.
now,
of
course
no
one
asked
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
pick
12,
9,
10
or
anything.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
cost
of
this
pipeline
quality
thing,
first
of
all
there
is
the
procedural
error,
it
isn't
in
the
record,
we
can't
quantify
in
the
court.
it
does
have
the
effect
of
reducing
this
cost
revenue
balance.
it
obviously
has
this
effect
on
the
allow
of
return.
we
can't
fill
those
gaps
or
speculate.
it
is
a
function
of
the
commission
to
make
the
additional
findings.
now,
just
briefly,
this
limited
remand
somebody
said
yesterday
that
it
could
take
forever.
it
is
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
it
would
be
true
under
any
limited
remand.
by
this
court
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
a
practical
matter
would
contemplate
getting
into
this
record.
these
pipeline
quality
and
cost
data
that
they
have
and
adjusting
the
findings.
and
i
think
in
the
essence
that
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
asking.
they
certainly
have
not
discarded
this
record.
thank
you
your
honors.
