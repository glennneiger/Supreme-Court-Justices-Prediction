mr.
robert
w.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
w.
henderson.
i
represent
hunt
oil
company
and
several
other
independent
producers.
we
are
petitioners
in
number
101.
it
is
not
our
position
before
this
court
that
group
area
ratemaking
per
se
is
unlawful.
it
is
our
position
that
the
application
of
the
method
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
unlawful.
first,
it
violates
the
individual
constitutional
rights
of
the
independent
producer
by
lowering
their
revenues
below
the
cost
incurred
by
those
producers
without
taking
into
consideration,
the
cost
incurring
factors
of
the
gas
itself.
the
second
reason
that
the
method
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
unlawful
is
because
it
does
not
provide
for
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
group
nor
for
the
individual
oil
and
gas
producers.
because
it
fails
to
provide
for
the
lowest
possible
reasonable
rate,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service
in
the
public
interest.
first
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
pertinent
facts
which
should
be
considered
by
this
commission
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
method
applied
by
the
commission
violates
the
constitution
or
the
statute.
that
is
reference
should
be
made
to
the
exhibits
in
the
record
which
appear
at
519e,
520e
which
is
basically
the
exhibit
174
prepared
by
the
staff
witness
wright.
it
shows
the
individual
cost
of
the
producers
whose
cost
reduced
by
the
commission
in
arriving
at
the
average.
of
course
that
exhibit
uses
a
9.5%
rate
of
return.
so
therefore
for
the
exhibit
to
actually
be
comparable
with
what
the
commission
determined
in
opinion
468,
the
return
component
of
that
exhibit
would
have
to
be
raised
from
9.5%
to
12%.
basically
that
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
appendix
1
to
our
brief
where
we
have
taken
the
individual
cost
of
the
44
producers,
raised
the
rate
of
return
from
9.5%
to
12%
and
have
shown
exactly
what
the
individual
cost
of
the
companies
would
be
and
this
is
what
it
showed.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
it
is
a
--
original
staff
exhibit.
what
the
commission
did,
they
applied
a
12%
rate
of
return
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
to
the
cost
of
44
producers.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
9.5%
figure
your
honor
came
from
the
recommendation
of
the
staff
witness,
the
entire
staff's
case
was
built
on
the
proposition
of
the
9.5%
rate
of
return
should
be
used.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
industry
of
which
--
we
were
supporting
the
industry
witness
was
contending
a
16%
rate
of
return
to
be
used.
the
commission
about
to
--
a
12%
rate
of
return.
so
the
appendix
to
our
brief
raises
the
figures
from
9.5%
to
12%
and
sets
forth
the
cost
of
the
44
producers
whose
cost
reduced
by
the
commission
of
arriving
at
the
average.
among
the
44
producers
there
is
a
wide
dispersion
of
cost.
this
wide
dispersion
is
shown
in
schedule
2,
of
appendix
1
attached
to
our
brief.
that
appendix
shows
of
the
per
unit
cost
was
as
low
as
5
cents
per
mcf
and
it
all
further
shows
the
16
producers
of
the
44
had
cost
below
the
14.5
some
average,
and
that
28
of
the
producers
had
cost
above
14.5
set
price.
of
the
28
producers
who
had
cost
above
the
14.5
cents,
well,
had
cost
between
14.5
to
20
cents.
sixteen
of
the
28
had
cost
even
above
20
cents
per
mcf.
if
you
would
take
an
average
of
the
cost
of
the
producers
who
have
cost
below
the
14.5,
their
cost
would
average
12.6
cents.
if
you
were
to
take
an
average
of
the
28
producers
who
have
cost
above
the
14.5,
their
cost
would
average
23
cents.
the
commission
attempts
to
leave
the
impression
that
cost
above
the
average
is
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
and
cites
to
acker
versus
u.s.,
298
u.s.
426
for
the
proposition
that
regulatory
agencies
should
not
allow
such
cost.
we
do
not
contend
that
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
should
be
allowed.
we
have
no
gold
plated
wells.
acker
versus
u.s.
should
be
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
method
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
inappropriate.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“the
secretary
was
not
bound
to
and
indeed
he
could
not
adopt
anyone
agency's
cost
or
an
average
of
the
cost
irrelevant.
to
do
so
would
be
to
leave
out
a
consideration,
relative
size,
relative
volume
and
relative
efficiency
of
individual
agencies”,
end
of
quote,
page
429.
in
this
case,
the
commission
has
not
considered
any
fact
other
than
the
average
cost
of
a
select
group
of
companies
representing
only
16%
of
the
gas
in
the
average.
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
size,
volume
or
other
cost
incurring
factors
which
are
inherent
in
the
gas
itself.
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
made
any
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
cost
incurred
by
the
producers
were
extravagant
or
wasteful.
in
fact,
all
of
the
cost
of
the
selected
group
of
44
producers
were
included
in
the
cost
finding.
this
inclusion
should
by
implication
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
cost
so
included
was
not
extravagant
or
wasteful.
the
wide
variations
in
per
unit
cost
between
producers
is
not
a
question
of
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
but
is
an
inherent
characteristic
of
the
gas
producing
industry.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
we,
like
superior
oil
company
tendered
the
--
a
complete
cost
showing
with
reference
to
hunt
oil
company.
but
pursuant
to
the
commission's
order
with
reference
to
individual
company
cost,
the
examiner
excluded
all
of
the
cost
material.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
can
say
this
justice
fortas
that
our
cost
with
reference
to
exploration
would
be
somewhat
higher
than
the
average
of
4.08
cents.
i
believe
it
would
be
approximately
6%
--
excuse
me,
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
6
cents.
but
your
honor,
most
of
the
cost
is
embedded
cost
that
is
cost
in
drilling
deep
wells.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
is
a
most
difficult
question
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
personally
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
believe
your
honor
that
sufficient
amount
of
exploration
expenditure
should
be
included
in
determining
whether
or
not
confiscation
has
resulted.
now,
what
amount
it
should
be,
i
--
at
this
moment
i
cannot
say.
it
should
at
least
be
that
amount
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
it
should
be
at
least
that
amount
which
would
replace
the
volumes
that
you
are
--
presently
so.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
if
i
understand
the
question
justice
fortas,
you're
assuming
that
the
industry
has
an
average
of
4%
per
mcf
exploration
expense?
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
basically
hunt
oil
company
would
have
an
average
of
6
cents
exploration
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
expenditures
and
has
been
able
to
replace
the
volumes
that
they
have
been
currently
selling.
i
would
say
in
that
situation
your
honor
that
basically
the
industry
by
incurring
the
4
cents
exploration
expenditure
has
basically
replaced
the
volumes
that
the
industry
had
sold.
that
we've
got
(inaudible)
to
just
maintain
the
status
quo.
definitely
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
i
believe
from
a
confiscatory
standpoint,
that
should
be
included.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
would
say
from
the
confiscatory
standpoint
that
there
is
certainly
some
latitude
in
allowing
a
confiscation,
maybe
all
of
the
exploration
development
expenditures
may
not
be
allowed.
but
your
honor,
most
of
the
cost
with
reference
to
confiscation
comes
from
the
actual
amount
of
investment
that
you
have
in
the
wells
on
the
profit,
the
operating
expense.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir
it
would
be.
not
only
for
hunt
oil
company
but
for
all
of
the
in
--
small
independent
producers,
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
we
are
a
large
independent
producer
somewhat
like
superior
oil
company
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
but
we
are
primarily
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
justice
fortas
i
believe
you
said,
excluding
all
exploration
and
development
expenditures.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
and
my
prior
answer
to
you
was
with
the
idea
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
exploration
development
expenditure
would
be
included
in
considering
what
the
confiscation
resulted.
in
some
areas
your
honor,
i
cannot
state
for
a
fact
about
permian
basin.
in
some
areas,
the
cost
actually
put
into
the
well
investment
is
at
the
revenue
level.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
in
19
six
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
your
honor,
i
construe
confiscation
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
as
being
that
you
should
have
a
return
of
your
capital.
and
i
believe
that
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
is
depreciation
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
believe
your
honor
that
anytime
you
consider
the
oil
and
gas
industry,
you
have
to
include
a
certain
amount
of
exploration
expenditures
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
well
that
--
there
would
be
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
would
be
a
different
question
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
don't
completely
understand
your
question
justice
black.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
no
sir,
no,
no,
that
situation,
i
might
--
there
should
be
enough
revenues
for
that
to
cover
the
ordinary
replacement
cost
of
the
products
that
yourself
and
if
that
happens
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
right.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
would
not
stand
before
this
court
and
claim
constitution
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
confiscation
under
those
circumstances,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i'm
sorry,
i
meant
--
i've
left
that
impression
your
honor.
the
wide
variations
of
per
unit
cost
between
producers
is
a
cost
incurring
factor
in
the
gas
itself
depends
upon
the
time
the
gas
was
discovered
and
developed,
it
depends
upon
the
depth
on
which
the
gas
is
discovered.
it
depends
upon
the
size
of
the
reservoirs
and
the
rate
of
production
that
those
reservoirs
are
produced
by.
that
is
why
we
have
the
wide
dispersion
of
cost
of
the
gas
and
that
is
the
reason
why
you
have
the
wide
dispersions
of
cost
with
reference
to
individual
producer.
moreover,
it
depends
in
part
of
whether
the
producer
is
an
active
explorationist
or
whether
he
is
depleting
his
inventory
without
replacement.
now
the
period
of
time
in
which
gas
is
discovered
and
developed
as
a
material
effective
on
cost,
the
examiner
found
the
cost
increased
by
approximately
75%
from
1948
to
1960.
costs
prior
to
1948
relating
to
25%
of
the
volumes
has
been
included
in
the
composite
on
which
the
commission
has
determined
the
14.5
cents
price.
the
commission
itself
recognized
that
drilling
cost
decreased
by
approximately
6%
from
1958
to
1960.
if
gas
cost
16.5
cents
of
1960,
the
gas
discovered
and
developed
in
1958
would
have
the
cost
17.5
cents,
not
14.5.
the
size
of
the
reservoir
discovered
in
the
rate
--
such
reservoir
is
depleted
is
substantially
material
on
the
per
unit
cost
of
gas.
the
record
shows
in
this
proceeding
that
in
the
1960
test
year,
in
the
permian
basin
area
when
you
are
considering
only
gas-well
gas,
two
fields
in
that
entire
permian
basin
area
accounted
for
52.5%
of
the
gas,
13
fields
accounted
for
17
--
excuse
me,
76%
of
it,
24%
of
the
gas-well
gas
in
1960
produced
in
the
permian
basin
came
from
358
(inaudible).
however,
there
is
no
record
--
evidence
as
to
whether
the
cost
used
by
the
commission
relating
to
the
group
of
44
producers
came
entirely
from
the
two
field
or
whether
it
came
from
the
13
fields
or
whether
there
was
a
dispersion
among
the
other
358
fields.
it
cannot
be
disputed
that
you
have
two
reservoirs
and
the
cost
of
each
reservoir
is
the
same.
and
one
reservoir
contains
twice
as
much
gas.
the
smaller
reservoir
and
the
gas
produced
from
it,
the
gas
cost
is
going
to
be
twice
as
high
thus
a
cost
incurring
factor
of
gas,
etcetera.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
justice
fortas
i
believe
there
could
be
a
very
simple
answer
to
that.
let's
take
over
--
let's
--
don't
take
one
test
of
year,
let's
take
over
a
period
of
years,
three-year
supply.
this
particular
producer
was
replacing
double
the
reserves
produced,
he
was
adding
reserves
twice
the
amount
produced.
so
let's
assume
his
exploration
expenditures
were
10
cents.
in
that
situation,
then
i
would
i
say
from
a
confiscatory
standpoint,
on
a
constitutional
standpoint,
that
basically
he
should
be
allowed
at
least
that
proportion
of
the
exploration
expenditures
which
would
let
him
replace
the
reserves
he
is
producing,
which
would
be
one-half
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
and
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
your
honor,
i'm
at
--
based
upon
the
commission's
orders
about
no
individual
cost
evidence,
the
evidence
does
--
on
the
individual
company
basis
does
not
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
there
is
an
offer
of
proof
your
honor,
but
the
evidence
does
not
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
w.
henderson.
i
represent
hunt
oil
company
and
several
other
independent
producers.
we
are
petitioners
in
number
101.
it
is
not
our
position
before
this
court
that
group
area
ratemaking
per
se
is
unlawful.
it
is
our
position
that
the
application
of
the
method
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
unlawful.
first,
it
violates
the
individual
constitutional
rights
of
the
independent
producer
by
lowering
their
revenues
below
the
cost
incurred
by
those
producers
without
taking
into
consideration,
the
cost
incurring
factors
of
the
gas
itself.
the
second
reason
that
the
method
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
unlawful
is
because
it
does
not
provide
for
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
group
nor
for
the
individual
oil
and
gas
producers.
because
it
fails
to
provide
for
the
lowest
possible
reasonable
rate,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service
in
the
public
interest.
first
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
pertinent
facts
which
should
be
considered
by
this
commission
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
method
applied
by
the
commission
violates
the
constitution
or
the
statute.
that
is
reference
should
be
made
to
the
exhibits
in
the
record
which
appear
at
519e,
520e
which
is
basically
the
exhibit
174
prepared
by
the
staff
witness
wright.
it
shows
the
individual
cost
of
the
producers
whose
cost
reduced
by
the
commission
in
arriving
at
the
average.
of
course
that
exhibit
uses
a
9.5%
rate
of
return.
so
therefore
for
the
exhibit
to
actually
be
comparable
with
what
the
commission
determined
in
opinion
468,
the
return
component
of
that
exhibit
would
have
to
be
raised
from
9.5%
to
12%.
basically
that
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
appendix
1
to
our
brief
where
we
have
taken
the
individual
cost
of
the
44
producers,
raised
the
rate
of
return
from
9.5%
to
12%
and
have
shown
exactly
what
the
individual
cost
of
the
companies
would
be
and
this
is
what
it
showed.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
it
is
a
--
original
staff
exhibit.
what
the
commission
did,
they
applied
a
12%
rate
of
return
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
to
the
cost
of
44
producers.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
9.5%
figure
your
honor
came
from
the
recommendation
of
the
staff
witness,
the
entire
staff's
case
was
built
on
the
proposition
of
the
9.5%
rate
of
return
should
be
used.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
the
industry
of
which
--
we
were
supporting
the
industry
witness
was
contending
a
16%
rate
of
return
to
be
used.
the
commission
about
to
--
a
12%
rate
of
return.
so
the
appendix
to
our
brief
raises
the
figures
from
9.5%
to
12%
and
sets
forth
the
cost
of
the
44
producers
whose
cost
reduced
by
the
commission
of
arriving
at
the
average.
among
the
44
producers
there
is
a
wide
dispersion
of
cost.
this
wide
dispersion
is
shown
in
schedule
2,
of
appendix
1
attached
to
our
brief.
that
appendix
shows
of
the
per
unit
cost
was
as
low
as
5
cents
per
mcf
and
it
all
further
shows
the
16
producers
of
the
44
had
cost
below
the
14.5
some
average,
and
that
28
of
the
producers
had
cost
above
14.5
set
price.
of
the
28
producers
who
had
cost
above
the
14.5
cents,
well,
had
cost
between
14.5
to
20
cents.
sixteen
of
the
28
had
cost
even
above
20
cents
per
mcf.
if
you
would
take
an
average
of
the
cost
of
the
producers
who
have
cost
below
the
14.5,
their
cost
would
average
12.6
cents.
if
you
were
to
take
an
average
of
the
28
producers
who
have
cost
above
the
14.5,
their
cost
would
average
23
cents.
the
commission
attempts
to
leave
the
impression
that
cost
above
the
average
is
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
and
cites
to
acker
versus
u.s.,
298
u.s.
426
for
the
proposition
that
regulatory
agencies
should
not
allow
such
cost.
we
do
not
contend
that
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
should
be
allowed.
we
have
no
gold
plated
wells.
acker
versus
u.s.
should
be
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
method
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
is
inappropriate.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“the
secretary
was
not
bound
to
and
indeed
he
could
not
adopt
anyone
agency's
cost
or
an
average
of
the
cost
irrelevant.
to
do
so
would
be
to
leave
out
a
consideration,
relative
size,
relative
volume
and
relative
efficiency
of
individual
agencies”,
end
of
quote,
page
429.
in
this
case,
the
commission
has
not
considered
any
fact
other
than
the
average
cost
of
a
select
group
of
companies
representing
only
16%
of
the
gas
in
the
average.
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
size,
volume
or
other
cost
incurring
factors
which
are
inherent
in
the
gas
itself.
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
made
any
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
cost
incurred
by
the
producers
were
extravagant
or
wasteful.
in
fact,
all
of
the
cost
of
the
selected
group
of
44
producers
were
included
in
the
cost
finding.
this
inclusion
should
by
implication
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
cost
so
included
was
not
extravagant
or
wasteful.
the
wide
variations
in
per
unit
cost
between
producers
is
not
a
question
of
extravagant
or
wasteful
cost
but
is
an
inherent
characteristic
of
the
gas
producing
industry.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
we,
like
superior
oil
company
tendered
the
--
a
complete
cost
showing
with
reference
to
hunt
oil
company.
but
pursuant
to
the
commission's
order
with
reference
to
individual
company
cost,
the
examiner
excluded
all
of
the
cost
material.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
can
say
this
justice
fortas
that
our
cost
with
reference
to
exploration
would
be
somewhat
higher
than
the
average
of
4.08
cents.
i
believe
it
would
be
approximately
6%
--
excuse
me,
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
6
cents.
but
your
honor,
most
of
the
cost
is
embedded
cost
that
is
cost
in
drilling
deep
wells.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
is
a
most
difficult
question
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
personally
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
believe
your
honor
that
sufficient
amount
of
exploration
expenditure
should
be
included
in
determining
whether
or
not
confiscation
has
resulted.
now,
what
amount
it
should
be,
i
--
at
this
moment
i
cannot
say.
it
should
at
least
be
that
amount
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
it
should
be
at
least
that
amount
which
would
replace
the
volumes
that
you
are
--
presently
so.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
if
i
understand
the
question
justice
fortas,
you're
assuming
that
the
industry
has
an
average
of
4%
per
mcf
exploration
expense?
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
basically
hunt
oil
company
would
have
an
average
of
6
cents
exploration
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
expenditures
and
has
been
able
to
replace
the
volumes
that
they
have
been
currently
selling.
i
would
say
in
that
situation
your
honor
that
basically
the
industry
by
incurring
the
4
cents
exploration
expenditure
has
basically
replaced
the
volumes
that
the
industry
had
sold.
that
we've
got
(inaudible)
to
just
maintain
the
status
quo.
definitely
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
i
believe
from
a
confiscatory
standpoint,
that
should
be
included.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
would
say
from
the
confiscatory
standpoint
that
there
is
certainly
some
latitude
in
allowing
a
confiscation,
maybe
all
of
the
exploration
development
expenditures
may
not
be
allowed.
but
your
honor,
most
of
the
cost
with
reference
to
confiscation
comes
from
the
actual
amount
of
investment
that
you
have
in
the
wells
on
the
profit,
the
operating
expense.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir
it
would
be.
not
only
for
hunt
oil
company
but
for
all
of
the
in
--
small
independent
producers,
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
we
are
a
large
independent
producer
somewhat
like
superior
oil
company
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
but
we
are
primarily
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
justice
fortas
i
believe
you
said,
excluding
all
exploration
and
development
expenditures.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
and
my
prior
answer
to
you
was
with
the
idea
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
exploration
development
expenditure
would
be
included
in
considering
what
the
confiscation
resulted.
in
some
areas
your
honor,
i
cannot
state
for
a
fact
about
permian
basin.
in
some
areas,
the
cost
actually
put
into
the
well
investment
is
at
the
revenue
level.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
in
19
six
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
your
honor,
i
construe
confiscation
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
as
being
that
you
should
have
a
return
of
your
capital.
and
i
believe
that
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
is
depreciation
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
believe
your
honor
that
anytime
you
consider
the
oil
and
gas
industry,
you
have
to
include
a
certain
amount
of
exploration
expenditures
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
well
that
--
there
would
be
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
that
would
be
a
different
question
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
don't
completely
understand
your
question
justice
black.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
no
sir,
no,
no,
that
situation,
i
might
--
there
should
be
enough
revenues
for
that
to
cover
the
ordinary
replacement
cost
of
the
products
that
yourself
and
if
that
happens
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
right.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i
would
not
stand
before
this
court
and
claim
constitution
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
confiscation
under
those
circumstances,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
i'm
sorry,
i
meant
--
i've
left
that
impression
your
honor.
the
wide
variations
of
per
unit
cost
between
producers
is
a
cost
incurring
factor
in
the
gas
itself
depends
upon
the
time
the
gas
was
discovered
and
developed,
it
depends
upon
the
depth
on
which
the
gas
is
discovered.
it
depends
upon
the
size
of
the
reservoirs
and
the
rate
of
production
that
those
reservoirs
are
produced
by.
that
is
why
we
have
the
wide
dispersion
of
cost
of
the
gas
and
that
is
the
reason
why
you
have
the
wide
dispersions
of
cost
with
reference
to
individual
producer.
moreover,
it
depends
in
part
of
whether
the
producer
is
an
active
explorationist
or
whether
he
is
depleting
his
inventory
without
replacement.
now
the
period
of
time
in
which
gas
is
discovered
and
developed
as
a
material
effective
on
cost,
the
examiner
found
the
cost
increased
by
approximately
75%
from
1948
to
1960.
costs
prior
to
1948
relating
to
25%
of
the
volumes
has
been
included
in
the
composite
on
which
the
commission
has
determined
the
14.5
cents
price.
the
commission
itself
recognized
that
drilling
cost
decreased
by
approximately
6%
from
1958
to
1960.
if
gas
cost
16.5
cents
of
1960,
the
gas
discovered
and
developed
in
1958
would
have
the
cost
17.5
cents,
not
14.5.
the
size
of
the
reservoir
discovered
in
the
rate
--
such
reservoir
is
depleted
is
substantially
material
on
the
per
unit
cost
of
gas.
the
record
shows
in
this
proceeding
that
in
the
1960
test
year,
in
the
permian
basin
area
when
you
are
considering
only
gas-well
gas,
two
fields
in
that
entire
permian
basin
area
accounted
for
52.5%
of
the
gas,
13
fields
accounted
for
17
--
excuse
me,
76%
of
it,
24%
of
the
gas-well
gas
in
1960
produced
in
the
permian
basin
came
from
358
(inaudible).
however,
there
is
no
record
--
evidence
as
to
whether
the
cost
used
by
the
commission
relating
to
the
group
of
44
producers
came
entirely
from
the
two
field
or
whether
it
came
from
the
13
fields
or
whether
there
was
a
dispersion
among
the
other
358
fields.
it
cannot
be
disputed
that
you
have
two
reservoirs
and
the
cost
of
each
reservoir
is
the
same.
and
one
reservoir
contains
twice
as
much
gas.
the
smaller
reservoir
and
the
gas
produced
from
it,
the
gas
cost
is
going
to
be
twice
as
high
thus
a
cost
incurring
factor
of
gas,
etcetera.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
justice
fortas
i
believe
there
could
be
a
very
simple
answer
to
that.
let's
take
over
--
let's
--
don't
take
one
test
of
year,
let's
take
over
a
period
of
years,
three-year
supply.
this
particular
producer
was
replacing
double
the
reserves
produced,
he
was
adding
reserves
twice
the
amount
produced.
so
let's
assume
his
exploration
expenditures
were
10
cents.
in
that
situation,
then
i
would
i
say
from
a
confiscatory
standpoint,
on
a
constitutional
standpoint,
that
basically
he
should
be
allowed
at
least
that
proportion
of
the
exploration
expenditures
which
would
let
him
replace
the
reserves
he
is
producing,
which
would
be
one-half
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
--
and
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
your
honor,
i'm
at
--
based
upon
the
commission's
orders
about
no
individual
cost
evidence,
the
evidence
does
--
on
the
individual
company
basis
does
not
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
w.
henderson
there
is
an
offer
of
proof
your
honor,
but
the
evidence
does
not
go
that
far.
