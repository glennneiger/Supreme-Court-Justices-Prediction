mr.
crawford
c.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
crawford
martin.
i'm
the
elected
attorney
general
of
texas
and
i
appear
here
this
morning
representing
the
state
of
texas
in
official
capacity.
i
--
some
of
these
producers
maybe
my
constituents
but
they
are
--
i
do
not
represent
the
producers
here
this
morning.
we
are
representing
the
state
and
we
appear
before
you
here
presenting
four
points
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
expert
witnesses
or
the
things
in
this
lawsuit.
it's
only
the
state's
interest
and
mr.
boston
witt,
attorney
general
of
new
mexico
beyond
the
left
will
present
the
last
two
points,
i
will
present
two
points.
our
arguments
will
be
brief
as
you
see
the
producers
after
part
of
the
time.
but
i
will
try
to
go
as
fast
as
i
can
on
them
your
honor.
the
points
that
we
have
are
listed
at
four
points.
i
will
cover
the
first
two,
they're
actually
all
related.
we
first
contend
that
the
state
of
texas
presented
evidence
in
this
case
before
the
commission
of
the
hearing
examiner,
the
commission
rejected
it
on
account
of
the
holding
in
the
hope
case
and
the
circuit
court
of
den
--
in
denver,
colorado
upheld
that
particular
point.
there's
only
one
little
paragraph
in
the
decision
that
we
disagree
with
and
that's
what
we're
actually
here
this
morning.
as
you
know
the
hope
case
was
decided
in
1944,
some
10
years
before
this
court
held
that
the
producer
came
under
the
natural
gas
act.
we
are
--
appeal
that
we
do
not
--
that
that
decision
does
not
control
as
it
now,
the
act
is
now
come
into
be.
it
was
one
pipeline,
do
you
remember
out
of
west
virginia
and
one
producer
--
or
not
producer,
one
distributor
there
or
the
consumers
rather,
and
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
i
would
just
--
it
was
a
small
of
matter.
west
virginia
was
trying
to
argue
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
price
of
gas
up
in
order
to
protect
coal
and
all
that
have
an
effect
on
the
economy
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
the
court
rejected
that.
but
we
don't
have
that
thing
here
this
morning.
the
court
said
in
that
case,
in
the
hope
case
that
the
results
to
west
virginia
were
--
in
our
--
i
believe
i
quoted
right,
it
was
indirect
and
it
was
insignificant.
now
we
have
in
texas
and
new
mexico,
since
we're
arguing
this
jointly,
a
tremendous
area
out
there.
we
have
4,700,000
acres
of
land
in
this
basin.
i
believe
new
mexico
has
around
3
million
acres
in
the
basin.
now
this
4,700,000,
the
greatest
majority
of
the
fact
in
all
of
it
is
state
owned
land.
the
state
owns
the
minerals
under
this
land.
they're
producing
--
the
producers
here
made
contract
with
landowner
which
--
acting
as
agent
for
the
state
are
the
state
in
most
cases
lately
have
been
leasing
the
land
themselves.
we
have
grown
up
tremendous
cities
and
an
area.
if
you've
been
there,
is
not
in
the
world
but
(inaudible)
less
than
3
to
4
inches
of
the
land
a
year
not
suited
(inaudible)
there's
no
irrigation
water.
the
ranching
is
all
it
can
do
outside
of
producing
oil.
it
built
up
a
tremendous
economy
in
there.
and
we
undertook
before
the
examiner
and
to
show
the
commission
that
the
production
of
oil
and
the
production
of
gas
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
economy
of
our
state.
now
we're
not
just
talking
about
--
the
one
i'm
talking
about
the
hope
case.
i'm
not
just
talking
about
this
particular
case
because
as
it
was
indicated
yesterday
they
have
hearings
under
way
in
which
will
cover
--
blanket
our
entire
estate.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
(inaudible)
left
out
i'm
sure
that
they
have
tried
to
get
(inaudible).
but
those
--
will
have
the
last
case,
i
believe
the
catchall.
and
i
won't
--
i
want
the
court
to
understand
that
we
don't
have
a
one
plea
here
this
morning
that's
all
we're
after.
all
we're
interested
in
is
that
the
state
of
texas
be
allowed
to
present
its
evidence
as
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
order
might
have
on
the
state
and
its
economy.
i'm
going
to
read
those
brief
in
and
with
our
cut
cover
one
or
two
then
we
--
and
then
will
turnover
to
mr.
witt.
i
--
the
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir?
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
we
had
an
opportunity
to
present.
we
presented
one
morning,
i
believe,
of
the
evidence
there
but
the
commission
rejected
it
and
said
they
will
not
consider
it
and
they
--
the
--
didn't
record.
the
way
i
read
the
decision,
they
said
that
they
could
not
on
account
of
the
hope
case.
they
decided
the
hope
case
and
rejected
our
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir,
we
offered
a
proof
of
--
on
the
conservation
of
gas.
our
railroad
commissioner
mr.
murray
at
the
time
testified
as
to
how
this
would
work
with
that
and
the
other
was
offered
by
mr.
stockton
who
was
with
the
university
of
texas
and
he
offered
testimony
concerning
that
if
the
production
of
gas,
exploration
of
gas
is
discontinued
that
this
economy
with
million
and
millions
of
dollar
would
completely
collapse,
so
there's
nothing
else
to
support.
that
was
frankly
offered
but
the
court
decided
the
hope
case.
what
i
want
to
try
to
tell
you,
(inaudible)
of
the
hope
case,
in
my
opinion,
there's
no
--
no
longer
apply
to
the
facts
or
at
least
to
--
as
i
understand.
now
new
mexico
they'd
say,
they
have
3
million
acres
and
about
45%
of
their
education
comes
out
of
that
particular
basin.
now
we
feel
that
the
commission
failed
in
the
statutory
responsibility
to
the
public
to
protect
the
public.
what
is
the
public
interest?
that
is
--
that's
the
question
that
was
--
that
is
the
question
that
i
could
--
that
we
have
here
in
front
of
us.
i
think
the
public
interest
includes
a
tremendous
wide
field.
is
not
--
and
i
think
the
commission
has
taken
that
in
view
and
we're
a
little
bit
alarmed
if
they
didn't
allow
the
full
range
and
look
at
that
testimony
because
we
feel
that
the
public
interest
includes
all
the
states.
and
this
is
a
constitutional
question
that
we've
mentioned
in
here
about
this
place
being
only
for
footing.
i
know
it's
very
easy
to
say,
"well,
you're
producing
state
and
therefore
you
shouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it".
as
long
as
it
is
only
cost
basis,
as
long
as
it
is
strictly
on
a
cost
basis,
i
would
probably
agree
with
the
court.
i
don't
disagree
with
the
hope
case
and
original
finding
but
i
certainly
disagree
with
it
when
you
change
it
from
and
it
seems
that
that's
the
direction
the
commission
is
going
at,
when
you're
changing
it
from
a
cost
basis
over
to
other
--
bringing
other
factors
particular
to
explore
for
new
gas.
then
you
would
certainly
bring
in
and
mr.
witt
will
cover
that
point
adequately,
the
conservation
of
oil
and
gas.
as
i
have
stated,
they
have
done
a
tremendous
job
and
the
railroad
commission
has
--
we
feel
likely
conserving
oil
and
gas
and
the
compact
was
renewed
i
believe
only
this
--
here
today
for
two
more
years.
i
wanted
to
state
to
the
court
as
my
opinion,
the
commission
and
the
court
completely
were
in
error
and
not
lying
this
evidence
in
because
of
the
public
interest.
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
you
can
say
well,
that
you're
going
to
have
--
just
look
at
the
consumer
in
the
matter
and
i
believe
it's
indicated
by
the
arguments
here
yesterday
that
the
consumer
in
this
case,
but
we
told
it
about
it
is
a
small
consumer,
that's
what
the
state
of
california
preceded.
i
say
that
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it
and
the
way
we
like
this
court
to
look
at
our
end
of
it,
there
are
high
quantities
and
there
are
low
quantities.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
believed
that
the
consumer
in
california
and
i
have
nothing
against
them.
and
i
want
to
say
that
if
the
state
is
allowed
in
here,
it
may
be
the
time
come
and
it
probably
will
come
soon
that
we
might
be
just
as
interested
in
the
lower
price
of
gas
than
we
were
in
the
higher
price
of
gas.
but
the
low
consumer
in
california,
i
mean
the
low
quantity
as
i
see
it
in
california,
is
testified
here
at
least
stated
in
the
court
yesterday
was
around
$6
to
$8
at
the
most,
maybe
$10
per
person
out
there.
i
slipped
into
the
meddling
of
this
area,
el
paso,
the
person
out
there
has
a
high
quantity
because
he
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
the
matter.
millions
of
dollars
invested
that
each
person
draws
a
salary
out
of
that
and
i
certainly
don't
stand
here
in
front
of
the
court
to
say
that
you
should
support
something
in
order
just
to
keep
few
people
off.
what
we
feel
like
that
the
court
should
look
at
this
and
should
allow
us
by
all
means
to
come
in
and
present
our
evidence.
if
the
court
doesn't
--
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
give
us
any
consideration,
we
--
i
would
say,
but
we
think
it
should
be
allowed
to
present
it.
thank
you.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
crawford
martin.
i'm
the
elected
attorney
general
of
texas
and
i
appear
here
this
morning
representing
the
state
of
texas
in
official
capacity.
i
--
some
of
these
producers
maybe
my
constituents
but
they
are
--
i
do
not
represent
the
producers
here
this
morning.
we
are
representing
the
state
and
we
appear
before
you
here
presenting
four
points
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
expert
witnesses
or
the
things
in
this
lawsuit.
it's
only
the
state's
interest
and
mr.
boston
witt,
attorney
general
of
new
mexico
beyond
the
left
will
present
the
last
two
points,
i
will
present
two
points.
our
arguments
will
be
brief
as
you
see
the
producers
after
part
of
the
time.
but
i
will
try
to
go
as
fast
as
i
can
on
them
your
honor.
the
points
that
we
have
are
listed
at
four
points.
i
will
cover
the
first
two,
they're
actually
all
related.
we
first
contend
that
the
state
of
texas
presented
evidence
in
this
case
before
the
commission
of
the
hearing
examiner,
the
commission
rejected
it
on
account
of
the
holding
in
the
hope
case
and
the
circuit
court
of
den
--
in
denver,
colorado
upheld
that
particular
point.
there's
only
one
little
paragraph
in
the
decision
that
we
disagree
with
and
that's
what
we're
actually
here
this
morning.
as
you
know
the
hope
case
was
decided
in
1944,
some
10
years
before
this
court
held
that
the
producer
came
under
the
natural
gas
act.
we
are
--
appeal
that
we
do
not
--
that
that
decision
does
not
control
as
it
now,
the
act
is
now
come
into
be.
it
was
one
pipeline,
do
you
remember
out
of
west
virginia
and
one
producer
--
or
not
producer,
one
distributor
there
or
the
consumers
rather,
and
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
i
would
just
--
it
was
a
small
of
matter.
west
virginia
was
trying
to
argue
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
price
of
gas
up
in
order
to
protect
coal
and
all
that
have
an
effect
on
the
economy
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
the
court
rejected
that.
but
we
don't
have
that
thing
here
this
morning.
the
court
said
in
that
case,
in
the
hope
case
that
the
results
to
west
virginia
were
--
in
our
--
i
believe
i
quoted
right,
it
was
indirect
and
it
was
insignificant.
now
we
have
in
texas
and
new
mexico,
since
we're
arguing
this
jointly,
a
tremendous
area
out
there.
we
have
4,700,000
acres
of
land
in
this
basin.
i
believe
new
mexico
has
around
3
million
acres
in
the
basin.
now
this
4,700,000,
the
greatest
majority
of
the
fact
in
all
of
it
is
state
owned
land.
the
state
owns
the
minerals
under
this
land.
they're
producing
--
the
producers
here
made
contract
with
landowner
which
--
acting
as
agent
for
the
state
are
the
state
in
most
cases
lately
have
been
leasing
the
land
themselves.
we
have
grown
up
tremendous
cities
and
an
area.
if
you've
been
there,
is
not
in
the
world
but
(inaudible)
less
than
3
to
4
inches
of
the
land
a
year
not
suited
(inaudible)
there's
no
irrigation
water.
the
ranching
is
all
it
can
do
outside
of
producing
oil.
it
built
up
a
tremendous
economy
in
there.
and
we
undertook
before
the
examiner
and
to
show
the
commission
that
the
production
of
oil
and
the
production
of
gas
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
economy
of
our
state.
now
we're
not
just
talking
about
--
the
one
i'm
talking
about
the
hope
case.
i'm
not
just
talking
about
this
particular
case
because
as
it
was
indicated
yesterday
they
have
hearings
under
way
in
which
will
cover
--
blanket
our
entire
estate.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
(inaudible)
left
out
i'm
sure
that
they
have
tried
to
get
(inaudible).
but
those
--
will
have
the
last
case,
i
believe
the
catchall.
and
i
won't
--
i
want
the
court
to
understand
that
we
don't
have
a
one
plea
here
this
morning
that's
all
we're
after.
all
we're
interested
in
is
that
the
state
of
texas
be
allowed
to
present
its
evidence
as
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
order
might
have
on
the
state
and
its
economy.
i'm
going
to
read
those
brief
in
and
with
our
cut
cover
one
or
two
then
we
--
and
then
will
turnover
to
mr.
witt.
i
--
the
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir?
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
we
had
an
opportunity
to
present.
we
presented
one
morning,
i
believe,
of
the
evidence
there
but
the
commission
rejected
it
and
said
they
will
not
consider
it
and
they
--
the
--
didn't
record.
the
way
i
read
the
decision,
they
said
that
they
could
not
on
account
of
the
hope
case.
they
decided
the
hope
case
and
rejected
our
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir,
we
offered
a
proof
of
--
on
the
conservation
of
gas.
our
railroad
commissioner
mr.
murray
at
the
time
testified
as
to
how
this
would
work
with
that
and
the
other
was
offered
by
mr.
stockton
who
was
with
the
university
of
texas
and
he
offered
testimony
concerning
that
if
the
production
of

exploration
of

is
discontinued
that
this
economy
with
million
and
millions
of
dollar
would
completely
collapse,
so
there's
nothing
else
to
support.
that
was
frankly
offered
but
the
court
decided
the
hope
case.
what
i
want
to
try
to
tell
you,
(inaudible)
of
the
hope
case,
in
my
opinion,
there's
no
--
no
longer
apply
to
the
facts
or
at
least
to
--
as
i
understand.
now
new
mexico
they'd
say,
they
have
3
million
acres
and
about
45%
of
their
education
comes
out
of
that
particular
basin.
now
we
feel
that
the
commission
failed
in
the
statutory
responsibility
to
the
public
to
protect
the
public.
what
is
the
public
interest?
that
is
--
that's
the
question
that
was
--
that
is
the
question
that
i
could
--
that
we
have
here
in
front
of
us.
i
think
the
public
interest
includes
a
tremendous
wide
field.
is
not
--
and
i
think
the
commission
has
taken
that
in
view
and
we're
a
little
bit
alarmed
if
they
didn't
allow
the
full
range
and
look
at
that
testimony
because
we
feel
that
the
public
interest
includes
all
the
states.
and
this
is
a
constitutional
question
that
we've
mentioned
in
here
about
this
place
being
only
for
footing.
i
know
it's
very
easy
to
say,
"well,
you're
producing
state
and
therefore
you
shouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it".
as
long
as
it
is
only
cost
basis,
as
long
as
it
is
strictly
on
a
cost
basis,
i
would
probably
agree
with
the
court.
i
don't
disagree
with
the
hope
case
and
original
finding
but
i
certainly
disagree
with
it
when
you
change
it
from
and
it
seems
that
that's
the
direction
the
commission
is
going
at,
when
you're
changing
it
from
a
cost
basis
over
to
other
--
bringing
other
factors
particular
to
explore
for
new
gas.
then
you
would
certainly
bring
in
and
mr.
witt
will
cover
that
point
adequately,
the
conservation
of
oil
and
gas.
as
i
have
stated,
they
have
done
a
tremendous
job
and
the
railroad
commission
has
--
we
feel
likely
conserving
oil
and
gas
and
the
compact
was
renewed
i
believe
only
this
--
here
today
for
two
more
years.
i
wanted
to
state
to
the
court
as
my
opinion,
the
commission
and
the
court
completely
were
in
error
and
not
lying
this
evidence
in
because
of
the
public
interest.
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
you
can
say
well,
that
you're
going
to
have
--
just
look
at
the
consumer
in
the
matter
and
i
believe
it's
indicated
by
the
arguments
here
yesterday
that
the
consumer
in
this
case,
but
we
told
it
about
it
is
a
small
consumer,
that's
what
the
state
of
california
preceded.
i
say
that
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it
and
the
way
we
like
this
court
to
look
at
our
end
of
it,
there
are
high
quantities
and
there
are
low
quantities.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
believed
that
the
consumer
in
california
and
i
have
nothing
against
them.
and
i
want
to
say
that
if
the
state
is
allowed
in
here,
it
may
be
the
time
come
and
it
probably
will
come
soon
that
we
might
be
just
as
interested
in
the
lower
price
of
gas
than
we
were
in
the
higher
price
of
gas.
but
the
low
consumer
in
california,
i
mean
the
low
quantity
as
i
see
it
in
california,
is
testified
here
at
least
stated
in
the
court
yesterday
was
around
$6
to
$8
at
the
most,
maybe
$10
per
person
out
there.
i
slipped
into
the
meddling
of
this
area,
el
paso,
the
person
out
there
has
a
high
quantity
because
he
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
the
matter.
millions
of
dollars
invested
that
each
person
draws
a
salary
out
of
that
and
i
certainly
don't
stand
here
in
front
of
the
court
to
say
that
you
should
support
something
in
order
just
to
keep
few
people
off.
what
we
feel
like
that
the
court
should
look
at
this
and
should
allow
us
by
all
means
to
come
in
and
present
our
evidence.
if
the
court
doesn't
--
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
give
us
any
consideration,
we
--
i
would
say,
but
we
think
it
should
be
allowed
to
present
it.
thank
you.
