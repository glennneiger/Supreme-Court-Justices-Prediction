justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
this
sweet
gas
and
sour
gas
oil?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
this
--
sour
of
gas
or
otherwise
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
too
much
sulfur.
justice
potter
stewart
or
otherwise
deficient
so
far
as
the
pipeline
quality
gas
goes
peculiar
to
oil-well
gas
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
more
likely
to
be
found
on
oil-well
gas
or
in
gas-well
gas
or
is
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
correlation
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
no
correlation
then,
between
the
two?
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
deficiency
is
maybe
of
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
--
as
a
matter
of
practice,
these
costs
are
born
by
the
pipelines,
aren't
they
or
are
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
there
are
--
or
are
there,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
some
where
the
producers
just
to
--
takes
his
gas
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
brings
it
up
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
pipeline
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
part
of
his
costs?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
gets
the
higher
price?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
way
you
have
done
it,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
is
--
is
that
a
downward
from
a
thousand
and
upward
from
1050?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
area
from
a
thousand
to
1050,
that
was
just
standard
gas
area?
justice
potter
stewart
no
adjustment
either
way.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
--
the
(inaudible)
of
oil
in
california.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
(inaudible)
oil
in
california
the
last
time
i
heard.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
question
it,
but
i
certainly
know
that
california
is
a
great
and
wonderful
state.
i
just
wondered
about
whether
or
not
your
people
out
there's
so
unique.
but
you
have
to
say
this
case
would
be
applicable
if
it
was
done
very
generally
i
suppose
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
coal?
justice
potter
stewart
but
since
that
the
matter
is
intact,
if
the
commission
is
upheld,
how
would
these
refund
going
to
work?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
refundable
and
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
to
the
pipeline
side.
justice
potter
stewart
pipelines
were
the
first
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
consumer?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
was
–
and
the
question
and
perhaps
i
think
you
understood
it
was,
as
a
matter
of
mechanics
under
the
--
in
this
case,
not
some
other
case
that
might
come
to
us
someday.
but
in
this
case,
if
the
commission
is
upheld,
as
a
matter
of
mechanics,
how
will
this
refund
be
refunded?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
by
we,
you
mean
the
public
utility
commission
of
california.
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
in
terms
of
dollars
exactly
would
this
refund
amount
to,
to
the
average
domestic
user
in
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
for
domestic
users?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
have
an
idea
how
many
domestic
users
there
are.
how
much
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
you
refund
those
–
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
users.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
in
the
--
that's
in
a
item
--
opinion
of
the
commissioner's
there
or
in
the
brief
for
commission
in
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
case
came
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
was
the
first
permian
basin
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
no
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
ratio
in
the
oil
industry
here
in
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
(inaudible)
--
it's
been
rather
steady.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
brief,
what
was
your
ultimate
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
no
way
of
storing
it
at
that
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
i
appreciate
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
offer
evidence
to
prove
that.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
claim
that
the
--
your
client
superior
oil
company
is
--
that
the
rate
has
that
effect
upon
superior
oil
company?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that'd
be
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
for
certain
producers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
this
sweet
gas
and
sour
gas
oil?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that

is
