mr.
oliver
l.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
behalf
of
the
side
of
producers
who
are
here
solely
as
respondents
seeking
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
i
wish
to
discuss
the
issue
of
refunds.
in
this
case,
the
commission
consolidated
a
large
number
of
section
4
(e)
increased
proceedings
which
were
pending
before
it.
and
in
its
decision,
the
commission
recognizes
that
its
decision
here
will
have
a
dual
impact
upon
producers,
that
is
it
fixes
a
rate
for
the
future
and
it
also
uses
that
rate
as
the
basis
for
the
refunds
in
the
past.
now,
in
determining
its
ceiling
rate
and
let's
speak
now
in
terms
of
the
flowing
gas
cost
because
that's
where
the
greatest
impact
is
with
respect
to
refunds.
the
commission
fixed
the
maximum
rate
at
14.5
cents.
and
it
did
that
on
the
use
of
aggregate
cost
or
as
i
would
call
it
using
the
group
approach.
after
having
used
that
approach
to
reach
that
unit
figure,
what
did
the
commission
do
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
refunds?
it
then
switched
over
to
an
individual
basis
and
ordered
each
company
that
had
an
increased
rate
above
that
14.5
cents
to
make
refunds
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
down
to
the
14.5
cents
as
further
reduced
for
quality
deficiencies.
in
doing
that
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
commission
gave
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
revenues
which
were
generated
during
this
past
period
by
virtue
of
the
rates
including
the
increases
either
to
the
industry
as
a
group
or
as
to
any
individual
company.
nor
did
the
commission
in
reaching
its
conclusion
on
refunds
on
an
individual
contract
by
contract
basis
decide
that
anyone
of
those
increases
was
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
the
commission
used
as
the
sole
basis
for
refunds
the
fact
that
the
individual
increase
exceeded
this
ceiling
price
as
further
adjusted
for
quality.
so
in
essence,
what
the
commission
did
as
we
view
it
is
to
determine
that
each
such
increase
above
that
ceiling
rate
was
unlawful
per
se.
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing
differed
with
the
commission
on
that
issue
concluding
that
no
refund
obligation
could
be
imposed
for
any
portion
of
this
past
period
in
which
there
was
a
group
revenue
deficiency.
before
pointing
out
the
principle
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
and
the
federal
power
commission
was
in
error,
let
me
make
as
clear
as
i
can
what
we
are
not
claiming.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
producers
should
be
entitled
to
raise
a
single
contract
price
we
have.
we
have
never
claimed
that
in
this
proceeding
at
any
of
its
stages.
we
do
claim
that
during
this
past
or
refund
period,
when
the
refunds
generated
to
the
group
are
less
than
the
revenue
requirements
of
the
cost
found
for
that
group
by
the
commission
it
is
improper
to
order
refunds.
now
we
do
not
say
that
some
refunds
might
not
be
due
in
the
future.
we
do
say
the
commission
committed
serious
error
in
not
giving
any
consideration
to
the
revenue
side
of
the
ledger
including
the
rates
as
increased
but
as
i
said
made
the
refunds
upon
the
mere
premise
that
the
individual
increase
happened
to
exceed
its
ceiling
price.
in
the
first
place,
we
believe
that
when
the
commission
in
an
area
proceeding
adopts
the
group
approach
to
determine
the
revenue
requirements
of
the
cost
on
a
group
basis
consistency
requires
that
that
same
group
or
unit
be
looked
to
on
the
revenue
side
of
the
ledger
to
see
whether
our
rates
including
the
increases
produce
too
much
or
too
little
revenue.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
an
excess
of
revenue?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
then
your
honor
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case,
then
refunds
on
some
equitable
individual
contract
by
contract
basis
could
be
ordered.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
it
could
be
done
rather
simply.
and
in
fact
i
think
if
this
case
is
remanded
as
we
suggest,
the
procedure
will
be
quite
simple
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
because
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
have
here
and
bear
in
mind,
we
are
talking
now
about
the
past
period,
this
refund
period
which
came
to
an
end
september
1,
1965
which
was
the
date
the
commission
said
its
rates
fixed
in
this
cre
--
in
this
case
will
be
effective
for
the
future.
so
under
section
5
(a)
starting
in
september,
the
commission
fixed
is
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
future.
now,
with
respect
to
these
increases,
we
are
concerned
only
with
a
past
period
as
we
think
this
court
was
in
second
thoughts.
you
asked,
your
honor,
how
might
they
do
it?
i
think
it
can
be
done
rather
simply.
and
we're
dealing
with
flowing
gas.
we
know
the
cost
for
revenue
requirement,
14.5
cents.
we'd
know
or
can
very
easily
ascertain
the
actual
revenue
to
the
industry
on
a
year
by
year
basis
because
producers
have
made
those
filings
with
the
commission.
for
each
year
let
us
take
the
test
year
1960,
you
have
the
cost
figure.
you
know
what
volumes
were
sold
jurisdictionally.
that's
in
this
record.
its
861
billion,
but
i
won't
bother
you
with
these
numbers.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
what?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
that's
not
revenue.
it's
either
cost
or
revenue
requirement.
let
--
i
think
falling
in
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
here's
what
i
would
do?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
you
can
do
that.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
you
can
do
that
but
the
way
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
proof
excess
of
revenue
would
be
take
this
unit
revenue
requirement
and
multiply
it
by
the
volumes
of
jurisdictional
gas.
that
will
give
you
a
total
dollar
figure.
now
you
know
the
total
revenue
figure
because
that's
on
file
with
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
happened
to
have
it.
for
the
test
year
if
you
multiply
the
14.5
by
the
test
year
jurisdictional
volumes,
you
come
out
just
with
about
$124
million.
that's
revenue
requirement.
our
actual
revenues
as
shown
by
exhibit
175
in
this
record
equals
--
it
comes
to
$109.5
million.
the
revenue
in
other
words
for
the
test
year
is
about
$14.5
million
less
than
our
revenue
requirements
as
found
by
the
commission.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
this
revenue
includes
the
rates
as
increased.
so
we
already
have
on
that
basis
for
the
test
year,
a
revenue
deficiency
in
the
order
of
some
$14.5
million
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
excuse
me.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
you're
confusing
rate
and
revenue.
the
14.5
cent
figure
is
our
cost.
they
did
not
give
us
revenue
to
come
up
to
the
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
fixed
it
as
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
the
maximum
rate.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that
is
correct.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that
same
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes,
you
could
get
it
that
way,
sure.
and
it
would
show
a
revenue
deficiency
then
on
a
unit
basis.
but
we
believed
that
the
commission
should
be
consistent
in
the
area
approach.
if
it
uses
the
group
approach
to
determine
the
industry's
requirements,
it
must
also
look
to
the
group
to
determine
whether
that
same
entity
got
too
much
or
too
little
revenue.
otherwise,
they've
gone
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
in
con
--
no.
in
computing
the
refunds
i
would
do
it
on
an
annual
basis
for
each
year
and
these
refunds
would
stop
at
september
1965.
the
commission
could
start
with
the
test
year
1960.
very
simply,
take
its
unit
revenue.
if
they
get
a
14.5
cents
multiply
that
by
the
volumes.
it
knows
the
actual
revenue.
now,
for
each
year
they
can
do
it
by
--
on
annual
pay
periods.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
they
could
do
it
if
they
saw
fit
that
way
but
i
think
since
these
reports
are
filed
normally
with
the
commission
on
your
revenues
on
an
annual
basis
and
the
examiner
would
have
recommended
too
doing
it
on
an
annual
basis,
i
would
think
that
might
be
the
better
approach
to
it,
your
honor
of
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no.
i
think
all
of
the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
area
now
are
a
group
and
to
me
it
constitutes
the
regulated
entity.
and
i
think
you
should
look
at
the
revenue
requirements
for
that
entity
during
each
of
these
years,
during
the
refund
period.
and
where
there
is
no
excess
revenue,
no
refunds.
now,
in
some
of
those
years
it
could
well
be,
your
honors,
that
there
will
be
an
excess
of
revenue
over
revenue
requirement.
then
how
might
they
do
it?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
certainly
did
on
our
gas
business
in
the
permian
basin,
we
think
more
than
$14.5
million.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it's
obvious
from
the
commission's
findings,
yes
it
is.
we
can
show
you
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it's
in
the
records
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
all
i
could
look
to,
your
honor
is
the
cost
found
by
the
commission.
and
according
to
that
we
did
lose
money.
now
another
reason
or
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
believe
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
position
we
advocate
here
namely
the
balancing
of
group
ne
--
revenue
requirements
as
against
the
groups
revenue
before
refunds
are
due
will
fully
accommodate
and
protect
the
interest
of
consumers
and
will
likewise
be
fair
to
the
interest
of
producers.
and
why
is
that?
this
is
why
we
believe
it
to
be
so.
this
court
knows
generally,
the
chain
of
command
or
events
by
which
gas,
gas
from
the
producing
field
out
to
the
consuming
points.
let's
take
the
permian
basin
and
then
the
principal
pipeline
there,
el
paso.
all
of
the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
sell
to
el
paso
at
various
prices
in
the
field.
el
paso
transports
this
gas
to
the
arizona,
california
stateline
where
--
there
sells
to
get
the
gas
to
the
distributors.
the
distributors
in
turn
move
it
within
the
state
for
delivery
and
sale
to
the
consumers.
el
paso's
price
to
the
distributors
at
the
california
stateline
is
of
course
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
regulation
is
upon
a
cost
of
service
basis.
into
that
cost
of
service
goes
what
is
known
as
el
paso's
purchased
gas
cost.
that
purchase
gas
cost
your
honors,
and
this
is
important,
is
a
lump
sum
or
total
aggregate
number
of
dollars
that
el
paso
has
paid
for
this
gas
to
the
producers.
that
passes
on
as
an
item
of
expense,
not
a
part
of
the
rate
base
on
which
returned
as
earned.
what
the
amount
that
el
paso
pays
for
the
various
producers
here
is
passed
on
as
an
expense
from
el
paso
through
the
distributors
to
the
consumers.
so
what
the
consumers
pay
for
this
el
paso
gas,
vis-à-vis
the
producers
is
the
aggregate
that
el
paso
pays
to
the
producers
for
the
same
gas.
now,
so
long,
so
long
as
the
aggregate
prices
paid
by
the
consumers
in
california
is
less
than
the
aggregate
cost
of
the
producers
of
making
that
gas
available
we
find
it
impossible
to
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
consumers
are
paying
excessive
charges
or
that
producers
are
receiving
excessive
prices.
the
commission
has
said
in
this
opinion
that
the
area
approach
as
it
question
will
enable
it
to
provide
a
fair
relationship
and
this
now
are
the
commission's
words,
a
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
i
was
using
that
as
an
example
--
the
same
--
in
--
and
in
fact
the
same
would
apply.
el
paso
and
transwestern
go
to
the
pacific
coast.
but
the
rates
are
passed
on
in
the
same
way.
that
is
the
consumer
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
who
has
--
i
understand
northern
natural,
the
one
that
goes
in
the
midwest,
but
it
would
be
the
same
proposition
there.
the
point,
your
honor,
is
this.
it's
the
aggregate
we're
looking
at
to
determine
whether
consumers
pay
excessive
prices.
the
aggregate
which
they
pay
as
against
the
aggregate
cost
to
all
of
the
producers
of
making
this
gas
available
and
that's
the
basis
i
think
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
that's
the
gist
of
our
position,
the
commission.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
is
none
in
first
determining
whether
or
not
refunds
are
due.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
you
would
still
have
to
have
the
same
in
this
clause
because
i
understand
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
to
be
able
to
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
a
required
or
a
necessary
part
of
the
area
rate
approach.
if
you
don't
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
no.
wait
a
--
no,
no
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
this
perfectly
clear.
in
order
to
determine
first
of
all
whether
the
revenue
requirements
are
being
met,
in
order
to
determine
whether
any
refunds
are
due,
this
thing
we
believe
must
be
evaluated
on
a
group
basis
and
that
will
fully
protect
consumers
and
we
think
also
be
fair
to
producers.
now,
if
you
make
the
evaluation
on
the
group
basis
and
it
turns
out
that
the
group
has
an
excess
of
revenue
then
as
the
court
of
appeal
said,
the
commission
can
then
order
refunds
on
some
equitable
in
--
contract
by
contract
basis.
and
that
as
i
see
it
would
be
about
the
only
practical
way
it
could
work
once
refunds
are
found
to
be
due.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
because
i
was
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
coming
to
it
next.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
your
assumption
is
wrong
yet
you
--
if
el
paso
were
paying
unlawful
prices
of
course,
we
should
have
--
we
might
have
to
make
refunds.
but
this
record
shows
this,
el
paso's
unit
gas
purchase
cost
for
all
these
gas
it
bought
in
the
permian
basin
for
the
test
year
1960
was
15.4
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
now,
my
point
is
this.
el
paso,
to
whom
most
of
these
refunds
would
go,
purchased
gas
in
the
permian
basin
for
the
test
year
had
more
than
a
cent
less
than
the
commission
determined
the
industry's
revenue
requirements
to
be.
and
i
figured
it
out
on
the
total
dollar
basis
and
for
the
test
year,
el
paso
paid
$84
million
for
this
gas
and
it
cost
the
producers
to
produce
it
according
to
the
commission's
own
determination
$90
million.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
there's
no
question,
they
bought
it
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's'
correct,
your
honor.
but
you
see
in
passing
on
their
rates
they
roll
them
in.
it's
an
aggregate
figure.
and
it's
--
in
the
el
paso's
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
the
commission
actually
didn't
say
very
much
about
that
except
that
they
said
anyone
that's
above
this
rate
we
think
is
unlawful
per
se
and
we
strike
it
down.
had
the
commission
really
evaluated
el
paso's
cost
for
this
gas
as
against
what
the
commission
itself
found
to
be
the
producer's
cost,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
sensibly
have
required
refunds
to
be
made
by
the
producers.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no.
if
i
may
your
honor,
the
commission
said
the
area
approached
enabled
it
and
would
afford
it
the
opportunity
of
striking
a
fair
relationship,
a
fair
relationship
between
and
the
aggregate
price
paid
by
the
consumers
and
the
aggregate
cost
incurred
by
the
producers.
and
we
are
saying
that's
all
we
are
contending
for
here.
look
at
this
thing
on
an
aggregate
or
a
group
basis.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
believe
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
first
of
all
your
honor,
we
disagree
that
there
was
generosity
there.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
assuming
that
figure
for
present
practices.
but
no
one
challenged
that
figure.
these
people
who
are
now
saying
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
the
generosity.
the
distributors
are
not
saying
--
they
did
not
challenge
the
court
below.
the
commission's
finding
of
the
revenue
requirement
figure
of
14.5
cents.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
as
they
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
did
as
they're
doing
here
now
your
honors.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
said
affirm
the
commission.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
my
clients?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
do
not,
we
do
not.
it's
a
question
of
design.
what
we
in
effect
--
what
we
are
saying
and
what
mr.
gillman
was
saying
that
it
operates
both
in
the
future
and
in
the
past
is
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
no.
we
are
accepting
the
commission's
revenue
requirement
determinations
for
this
purpose.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
commission
did
not
properly
design
rates
to
afford
the
industry
the
opportunity
to
recover
the
cost
as
the
commission
itself
determined
that
cost
to
be.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
and
we
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
our
attack
on
--
we
are
not
--
first
of
all
let
me
make
it
clear.
we
are
not
at
this
time
attacking
the
commission's
determination
for
all
gas
of
14.5
cents
was
alright.
we're
not
attacking
that
now.
what
we
are
saying
is
this.
you
have
found
our
revenue
requirements
on
a
cost
of
group
basis.
it
is
improper
to
fix
our
maximum
price.
at
the
average,
you
cannot
fix
the
ceiling
at
the
average.
you
have
not
properly
designed
rates
which
will
afford
us
the
industry
the
opportunity
of
recovering
our
cost
as
you
have
found
them
to
be.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
if
your
honor
would
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
right,
we
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
attacking
the
maximum
rate,
yes.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
but
we
are
not
attacking
this
revenue
requirement
at
the
moment.
we're
saying
you've
fixed
your
maximum
rate
too
low,
you
fix
it
at
the
average.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
absolutely!
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
the
commissions
couldn't
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
increase
them
and
someway
designed
the
rates
and
i
think
it
would
be
probably.
you
have
to
increase
this
maximum
somewhat
because
i
don't
think
we
want
a
sort
of
a
post
to
stamp
rate,
we
don't.
that
is
one
rate,
one
single
rate
clear
across
the
area
for
all
gas.
you
design
a
serum
of
ma
--
of
a
series
of
maximum
and
minimum
rates
and
within
that
the
opportunity
will
then
be
afforded
to
the
industry
to
recover
this
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
not
of
--
the
group
i'm
working
with
--
well,
we
--
no,
we
think
they
could
still
do
it
on
a
group
basis.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
maybe
if
i
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
let's
look
at
it
and
assume
what
we
are
saying
if
you're
going
to
go
to
group
basis
then
the
regulated
entity
becomes
the
group
instead
of
an
individual
company.
now
for
this
entity,
you
have
found
a
certain
revenue
requirement
figure.
and
all
we
are
saying
is,
"alright,
we're
not
challenging
that
at
this
moment".
but
having
found
the
revenue
needs
for
this
(inaudible)
you
must
then
decide
a
series
of
rates
which
will
afford
this
entity,
the
group.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
we'll
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it
would
be
that
way
because
the
contracts
will
operate
that
way.
some
of
them
will
be
limited
by
their
contracts.
we're
not
asking
for
our
contract
rates
to
be
increased.
yes,
there
will
be
varying
rates
within
that
maximum-minimum
range.
but
if
i
may
on
the
refund
question
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
philips
case
governs
here
on
refunds
because
we
think
the
situation
here
is
as
a
legal
matter
in
the
same
posture
as
was
second
phillips.
of
course,
here
the
regulated
entity
is
not
an
individual
company
but
a
group
of
companies.
but
in
second
phillips
they
were
dealing
with
a
past
period
or
a
refund
period.
i
think
i
understood
the
general
counsel
for
the
commission
yesterday
to
say
that
here
we
do
not
have
a
locked
in
period.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
a
discussion
to
this
administrative
terminology
but
the
significant
point
here
is,
the
commission
issued
its
order
under
section
5
(a)
of
the
law
and
it
made
that
effective
on
september
1,
1965.
and
it
said
this
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
all
gas
in
the
permian
basin
from
and
after
this
date.
so
these
rate
increase
proceedings
therefore
and
their
rates
was
superseded
as
of
that
date
by
the
commission's
order
in
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding.
so
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
past
or
an
impoundment
period
where
the
only
question
is
that
of
refunds.
and
in
second
phillips,
we
believe
that
the
commission
held
and
this
court
affirmed
that
rates
well
off
the
just
and
reasonable
if
you
wish,
though
the
commission
did
not
use
those
specific
words,
where
during
the
past
period,
the
revenues
to
phillips
were
less
than
these
revenue
requirements
even
though
some
of
the
individual
rates
exceeded
phillips'
revenue
requirement
of
12.16
cents
in
that
case.
that
we
submit
is
controlling
here
and
the
briefs
they
refer
to
the
tennessee
gas
case,
time
will
not
commit
my
going
into
that.
i
would
refer,
your
honors,
to
our
discussion
of
it.
in
our
brief,
tennessee
deals
with
zones,
a
rate
that
was
concededly
illegal
whereas
here
that's
a
question
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
and
those
in
our
brief
we
respectfully
urged
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
assume
you
want
me
to
(inaudible)
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
(inaudible).
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
(inaudible)
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
behalf
of
the
side
of
producers
who
are
here
solely
as
respondents
seeking
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
i
wish
to
discuss
the
issue
of
refunds.
in
this
case,
the
commission
consolidated
a
large
number
of
section
4
(e)
increased
proceedings
which
were
pending
before
it.
and
in
its
decision,
the
commission
recognizes
that
its
decision
here
will
have
a
dual
impact
upon
producers,
that
is
it
fixes
a
rate
for
the
future
and
it
also
uses
that
rate
as
the
basis
for
the
refunds
in
the
past.
now,
in
determining
its
ceiling
rate
and
let's
speak
now
in
terms
of
the
flowing
gas
cost
because
that's
where
the
greatest
impact
is
with
respect
to
refunds.
the
commission
fixed
the
maximum
rate
at
14.5
cents.
and
it
did
that
on
the
use
of
aggregate
cost
or
as
i
would
call
it
using
the
group
approach.
after
having
used
that
approach
to
reach
that
unit
figure,
what
did
the
commission
do
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
refunds?
it
then
switched
over
to
an
individual
basis
and
ordered
each
company
that
had
an
increased
rate
above
that
14.5
cents
to
make
refunds
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
down
to
the
14.5
cents
as
further
reduced
for
quality
deficiencies.
in
doing
that
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
commission
gave
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
revenues
which
were
generated
during
this
past
period
by
virtue
of
the
rates
including
the
increases
either
to
the
industry
as
a
group
or
as
to
any
individual
company.
nor
did
the
commission
in
reaching
its
conclusion
on
refunds
on
an
individual
contract
by
contract
basis
decide
that
anyone
of
those
increases
was
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
the
commission
used
as
the
sole
basis
for
refunds
the
fact
that
the
individual
increase
exceeded
this
ceiling
price
as
further
adjusted
for
quality.
so
in
essence,
what
the
commission
did
as
we
view
it
is
to
determine
that
each
such
increase
above
that
ceiling
rate
was
unlawful
per
se.
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing
differed
with
the
commission
on
that
issue
concluding
that
no
refund
obligation
could
be
imposed
for
any
portion
of
this
past
period
in
which
there
was
a
group
revenue
deficiency.
before
pointing
out
the
principle
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
and
the
federal
power
commission
was
in
error,
let
me
make
as
clear
as
i
can
what
we
are
not
claiming.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
producers
should
be
entitled
to
raise
a
single
contract
price
we
have.
we
have
never
claimed
that
in
this
proceeding
at
any
of
its
stages.
we
do
claim
that
during
this
past
or
refund
period,
when
the
refunds
generated
to
the
group
are
less
than
the
revenue
requirements
of
the
cost
found
for
that
group
by
the
commission
it
is
improper
to
order
refunds.
now
we
do
not
say
that
some
refunds
might
not
be
due
in
the
future.
we
do
say
the
commission
committed
serious
error
in
not
giving
any
consideration
to
the
revenue
side
of
the
ledger
including
the
rates
as
increased
but
as
i
said
made
the
refunds
upon
the
mere
premise
that
the
individual
increase
happened
to
exceed
its
ceiling
price.
in
the
first
place,
we
believe
that
when
the
commission
in
an
area
proceeding
adopts
the
group
approach
to
determine
the
revenue
requirements
of
the
cost
on
a
group
basis
consistency
requires
that
that
same
group
or
unit
be
looked
to
on
the
revenue
side
of
the
ledger
to
see
whether
our
rates
including
the
increases
produce
too
much
or
too
little
revenue.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
an
excess
of
revenue?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
then
your
honor
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case,
then
refunds
on
some
equitable
individual
contract
by
contract
basis
could
be
ordered.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
it
could
be
done
rather
simply.
and
in
fact
i
think
if
this
case
is
remanded
as
we
suggest,
the
procedure
will
be
quite
simple
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
because
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
have
here
and
bear
in
mind,
we
are
talking
now
about
the
past
period,
this
refund
period
which
came
to
an
end
september
1,
1965
which
was
the
date
the
commission
said
its
rates
fixed
in
this
cre
--
in
this
case
will
be
effective
for
the
future.
so
under
section
5
(a)
starting
in
september,
the
commission
fixed
is
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
future.
now,
with
respect
to
these
increases,
we
are
concerned
only
with
a
past
period
as
we
think
this
court
was
in
second
thoughts.
you
asked,
your
honor,
how
might
they
do
it?
i
think
it
can
be
done
rather
simply.
and
we're
dealing
with
flowing
gas.
we
know
the
cost
for
revenue
requirement,
14.5
cents.
we'd
know
or
can
very
easily
ascertain
the
actual
revenue
to
the
industry
on
a
year
by
year
basis
because
producers
have
made
those
filings
with
the
commission.
for
each
year
let
us
take
the
test
year
1960,
you
have
the
cost
figure.
you
know
what
volumes
were
sold
jurisdictionally.
that's
in
this
record.
its
861
billion,
but
i
won't
bother
you
with
these
numbers.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
what?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
that's
not
revenue.
it's
either
cost
or
revenue
requirement.
let
--
i
think
falling
in
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
here's
what
i
would
do?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
you
can
do
that.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
you
can
do
that
but
the
way
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
proof
excess
of
revenue
would
be
take
this
unit
revenue
requirement
and
multiply
it
by
the
volumes
of
jurisdictional
gas.
that
will
give
you
a
total
dollar
figure.
now
you
know
the
total
revenue
figure
because
that's
on
file
with
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
happened
to
have
it.
for
the
test
year
if
you
multiply
the
14.5
by
the
test
year
jurisdictional
volumes,
you
come
out
just
with
about
$124
million.
that's
revenue
requirement.
our
actual
revenues
as
shown
by
exhibit
175
in
this
record
equals
--
it
comes
to
$109.5
million.
the
revenue
in
other
words
for
the
test
year
is
about
$14.5
million
less
than
our
revenue
requirements
as
found
by
the
commission.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
this
revenue
includes
the
rates
as
increased.
so
we
already
have
on
that
basis
for
the
test
year,
a
revenue
deficiency
in
the
order
of
some
$14.5
million
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
excuse
me.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
you're
confusing
rate
and
revenue.
the
14.5
cent
figure
is
our
cost.
they
did
not
give
us
revenue
to
come
up
to
the
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
fixed
it
as
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
the
maximum
rate.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that
is
correct.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that
same
cost.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes,
you
could
get
it
that
way,
sure.
and
it
would
show
a
revenue
deficiency
then
on
a
unit
basis.
but
we
believed
that
the
commission
should
be
consistent
in
the
area
approach.
if
it
uses
the
group
approach
to
determine
the
industry's
requirements,
it
must
also
look
to
the
group
to
determine
whether
that
same
entity
got
too
much
or
too
little
revenue.
otherwise,
they've
gone
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
in
con
--
no.
in
computing
the
refunds
i
would
do
it
on
an
annual
basis
for
each
year
and
these
refunds
would
stop
at
september
1965.
the
commission
could
start
with
the
test
year
1960.
very
simply,
take
its
unit
revenue.
if
they
get
a
14.5
cents
multiply
that
by
the
volumes.
it
knows
the
actual
revenue.
now,
for
each
year
they
can
do
it
by
--
on
annual
pay
periods.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
they
could
do
it
if
they
saw
fit
that
way
but
i
think
since
these
reports
are
filed
normally
with
the
commission
on
your
revenues
on
an
annual
basis
and
the
examiner
would
have
recommended
too
doing
it
on
an
annual
basis,
i
would
think
that
might
be
the
better
approach
to
it,
your
honor
of
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no.
i
think
all
of
the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
area
now
are
a
group
and
to
me
it
constitutes
the
regulated
entity.
and
i
think
you
should
look
at
the
revenue
requirements
for
that
entity
during
each
of
these
years,
during
the
refund
period.
and
where
there
is
no
excess
revenue,
no
refunds.
now,
in
some
of
those
years
it
could
well
be,
your
honors,
that
there
will
be
an
excess
of
revenue
over
revenue
requirement.
then
how
might
they
do
it?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
certainly
did
on
our
gas
business
in
the
permian
basin,
we
think
more
than
$14.5
million.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it's
obvious
from
the
commission's
findings,
yes
it
is.
we
can
show
you
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
alright.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it's
in
the
records
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
all
i
could
look
to,
your
honor
is
the
cost
found
by
the
commission.
and
according
to
that
we
did
lose
money.
now
another
reason
or
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
believe
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
position
we
advocate
here
namely
the
balancing
of
group
ne
--
revenue
requirements
as
against
the
groups
revenue
before
refunds
are
due
will
fully
accommodate
and
protect
the
interest
of
consumers
and
will
likewise
be
fair
to
the
interest
of
producers.
and
why
is
that?
this
is
why
we
believe
it
to
be
so.
this
court
knows
generally,
the
chain
of
command
or
events
by
which
gas,
gas
from
the
producing
field
out
to
the
consuming
points.
let's
take
the
permian
basin
and
then
the
principal
pipeline
there,
el
paso.
all
of
the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
sell
to
el
paso
at
various
prices
in
the
field.
el
paso
transports
this
gas
to
the
arizona,
california
stateline
where
--
there
sells
to
get
the
gas
to
the
distributors.
the
distributors
in
turn
move
it
within
the
state
for
delivery
and
sale
to
the
consumers.
el
paso's
price
to
the
distributors
at
the
california
stateline
is
of
course
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
regulation
is
upon
a
cost
of
service
basis.
into
that
cost
of
service
goes
what
is
known
as
el
paso's
purchased
gas
cost.
that
purchase
gas
cost
your
honors,
and
this
is
important,
is
a
lump
sum
or
total
aggregate
number
of
dollars
that
el
paso
has
paid
for
this
gas
to
the
producers.
that
passes
on
as
an
item
of
expense,
not
a
part
of
the
rate
base
on
which
returned
as
earned.
what
the
amount
that
el
paso
pays
for
the
various
producers
here
is
passed
on
as
an
expense
from
el
paso
through
the
distributors
to
the
consumers.
so
what
the
consumers
pay
for
this
el
paso
gas,
vis-à-vis
the
producers
is
the
aggregate
that
el
paso
pays
to
the
producers
for
the
same
gas.
now,
so
long,
so
long
as
the
aggregate
prices
paid
by
the
consumers
in
california
is
less
than
the
aggregate
cost
of
the
producers
of
making
that
gas
available
we
find
it
impossible
to
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
consumers
are
paying
excessive
charges
or
that
producers
are
receiving
excessive
prices.
the
commission
has
said
in
this
opinion
that
the
area
approach
as
it
question
will
enable
it
to
provide
a
fair
relationship
and
this
now
are
the
commission's
words,
a
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
i
was
using
that
as
an
example
--
the
same
--
in
--
and
in
fact
the
same
would
apply.
el
paso
and
transwestern
go
to
the
pacific
coast.
but
the
rates
are
passed
on
in
the
same
way.
that
is
the
consumer
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
who
has
--
i
understand
northern
natural,
the
one
that
goes
in
the
midwest,
but
it
would
be
the
same
proposition
there.
the
point,
your
honor,
is
this.
it's
the
aggregate
we're
looking
at
to
determine
whether
consumers
pay
excessive
prices.
the
aggregate
which
they
pay
as
against
the
aggregate
cost
to
all
of
the
producers
of
making
this
gas
available
and
that's
the
basis
i
think
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
that's
the
gist
of
our
position,
the
commission.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
is
none
in
first
determining
whether
or
not
refunds
are
due.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
you
would
still
have
to
have
the
same
in
this
clause
because
i
understand
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
to
be
able
to
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
a
required
or
a
necessary
part
of
the
area
rate
approach.
if
you
don't
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
no.
wait
a
--
no,
no
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
this
perfectly
clear.
in
order
to
determine
first
of
all
whether
the
revenue
requirements
are
being
met,
in
order
to
determine
whether
any
refunds
are
due,
this
thing
we
believe
must
be
evaluated
on
a
group
basis
and
that
will
fully
protect
consumers
and
we
think
also
be
fair
to
producers.
now,
if
you
make
the
evaluation
on
the
group
basis
and
it
turns
out
that
the
group
has
an
excess
of
revenue
then
as
the
court
of
appeal
said,
the
commission
can
then
order
refunds
on
some
equitable
in
--
contract
by
contract
basis.
and
that
as
i
see
it
would
be
about
the
only
practical
way
it
could
work
once
refunds
are
found
to
be
due.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
because
i
was
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
coming
to
it
next.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
your
assumption
is
wrong
yet
you
--
if
el
paso
were
paying
unlawful
prices
of
course,
we
should
have
--
we
might
have
to
make
refunds.
but
this
record
shows
this,
el
paso's
unit
gas
purchase
cost
for
all
these
gas
it
bought
in
the
permian
basin
for
the
test
year
1960
was
15.4
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
now,
my
point
is
this.
el
paso,
to
whom
most
of
these
refunds
would
go,
purchased
gas
in
the
permian
basin
for
the
test
year
had
more
than
a
cent
less
than
the
commission
determined
the
industry's
revenue
requirements
to
be.
and
i
figured
it
out
on
the
total
dollar
basis
and
for
the
test
year,
el
paso
paid
$84
million
for
this
gas
and
it
cost
the
producers
to
produce
it
according
to
the
commission's
own
determination
$90
million.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
there's
no
question,
they
bought
it
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's'
correct,
your
honor.
but
you
see
in
passing
on
their
rates
they
roll
them
in.
it's
an
aggregate
figure.
and
it's
--
in
the
el
paso's
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
the
commission
actually
didn't
say
very
much
about
that
except
that
they
said
anyone
that's
above
this
rate
we
think
is
unlawful
per
se
and
we
strike
it
down.
had
the
commission
really
evaluated
el
paso's
cost
for
this
gas
as
against
what
the
commission
itself
found
to
be
the
producer's
cost,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
sensibly
have
required
refunds
to
be
made
by
the
producers.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no.
if
i
may
your
honor,
the
commission
said
the
area
approached
enabled
it
and
would
afford
it
the
opportunity
of
striking
a
fair
relationship,
a
fair
relationship
between
and
the
aggregate
price
paid
by
the
consumers
and
the
aggregate
cost
incurred
by
the
producers.
and
we
are
saying
that's
all
we
are
contending
for
here.
look
at
this
thing
on
an
aggregate
or
a
group
basis.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
believe
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
first
of
all
your
honor,
we
disagree
that
there
was
generosity
there.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
assuming
that
figure
for
present
practices.
but
no
one
challenged
that
figure.
these
people
who
are
now
saying
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
the
generosity.
the
distributors
are
not
saying
--
they
did
not
challenge
the
court
below.
the
commission's
finding
of
the
revenue
requirement
figure
of
14.5
cents.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
as
they
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
did
as
they're
doing
here
now
your
honors.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
said
affirm
the
commission.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
my
clients?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
do
not,
we
do
not.
it's
a
question
of
design.
what
we
in
effect
--
what
we
are
saying
and
what
mr.
gillman
was
saying
that
it
operates
both
in
the
future
and
in
the
past
is
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
no.
we
are
accepting
the
commission's
revenue
requirement
determinations
for
this
purpose.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
commission
did
not
properly
design
rates
to
afford
the
industry
the
opportunity
to
recover
the
cost
as
the
commission
itself
determined
that
cost
to
be.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
and
we
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
our
attack
on
--
we
are
not
--
first
of
all
let
me
make
it
clear.
we
are
not
at
this
time
attacking
the
commission's
determination
for
all
gas
of
14.5
cents
was
alright.
we're
not
attacking
that
now.
what
we
are
saying
is
this.
you
have
found
our
revenue
requirements
on
a
cost
of
group
basis.
it
is
improper
to
fix
our
maximum
price.
at
the
average,
you
cannot
fix
the
ceiling
at
the
average.
you
have
not
properly
designed
rates
which
will
afford
us
the
industry
the
opportunity
of
recovering
our
cost
as
you
have
found
them
to
be.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
if
your
honor
would
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
right,
we
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
attacking
the
maximum
rate,
yes.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
but
we
are
not
attacking
this
revenue
requirement
at
the
moment.
we're
saying
you've
fixed
your
maximum
rate
too
low,
you
fix
it
at
the
average.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
absolutely!
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
the
commissions
couldn't
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
increase
them
and
someway
designed
the
rates
and
i
think
it
would
be
probably.
you
have
to
increase
this
maximum
somewhat
because
i
don't
think
we
want
a
sort
of
a
post
to
stamp
rate,
we
don't.
that
is
one
rate,
one
single
rate
clear
across
the
area
for
all
gas.
you
design
a
serum
of
ma
--
of
a
series
of
maximum
and
minimum
rates
and
within
that
the
opportunity
will
then
be
afforded
to
the
industry
to
recover
this
cost
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
are
not
of
--
the
group
i'm
working
with
--
well,
we
--
no,
we
think
they
could
still
do
it
on
a
group
basis.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
maybe
if
i
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
let's
look
at
it
and
assume
what
we
are
saying
if
you're
going
to
go
to
group
basis
then
the
regulated
entity
becomes
the
group
instead
of
an
individual
company.
now
for
this
entity,
you
have
found
a
certain
revenue
requirement
figure.
and
all
we
are
saying
is,
"alright,
we're
not
challenging
that
at
this
moment".
but
having
found
the
revenue
needs
for
this
(inaudible)
you
must
then
decide
a
series
of
rates
which
will
afford
this
entity,
the
group.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
we'll
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it
would
be
that
way
because
the
contracts
will
operate
that
way.
some
of
them
will
be
limited
by
their
contracts.
we're
not
asking
for
our
contract
rates
to
be
increased.
yes,
there
will
be
varying
rates
within
that
maximum-minimum
range.
but
if
i
may
on
the
refund
question
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
philips
case
governs
here
on
refunds
because
we
think
the
situation
here
is
as
a
legal
matter
in
the
same
posture
as
was
second
phillips.
of
course,
here
the
regulated
entity
is
not
an
individual
company
but
a
group
of
companies.
but
in
second
phillips
they
were
dealing
with
a
past
period
or
a
refund
period.
i
think
i
understood
the
general
counsel
for
the
commission
yesterday
to
say
that
here
we
do
not
have
a
locked
in
period.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
a
discussion
to
this
administrative
terminology
but
the
significant
point
here
is,
the
commission
issued
its
order
under
section
5
(a)
of
the
law
and
it
made
that
effective
on
september
1,
1965.
and
it
said
this
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
all
gas
in
the
permian
basin
from
and
after
this
date.
so
these
rate
increase
proceedings
therefore
and
their
rates
was
superseded
as
of
that
date
by
the
commission's
order
in
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding.
so
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
past
or
an
impoundment
period
where
the
only
question
is
that
of
refunds.
and
in
second
phillips,
we
believe
that
the
commission
held
and
this
court
affirmed
that
rates
well
off
the
just
and
reasonable
if
you
wish,
though
the
commission
did
not
use
those
specific
words,
where
during
the
past
period,
the
revenues
to
phillips
were
less
than
these
revenue
requirements
even
though
some
of
the
individual
rates
exceeded
phillips'
revenue
requirement
of
12.16
cents
in
that
case.
that
we
submit
is
controlling
here
and
the
briefs
they
refer
to
the
tennessee
gas
case,
time
will
not
commit
my
going
into
that.
i
would
refer,
your
honors,
to
our
discussion
of
it.
in
our
brief,
tennessee
deals
with
zones,
a
rate
that
was
concededly
illegal
whereas
here
that's
a
question
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
and
those
in
our
brief
we
respectfully
urged
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
assume
you
want
me
to
(inaudible)
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
(inaudible).
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
(inaudible)
