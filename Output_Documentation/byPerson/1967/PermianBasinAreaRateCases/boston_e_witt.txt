mr.
boston
e.
witt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
boston
witt.
i'm
the
attorney
general
of
new
mexico.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
new
mexico
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
now,
the
court
please
i
could
stand
here
during
my
allotted
time
and
commiserate
about
how
much
tax
money
this
decision
will
cost
new
mexico.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
far
more
important
question
at
issue
here.
far
more
important
than
any
tax
lost
to
new
mexico.
even
more
important
than
any
profit,
to
any
company
involved
in
this
case
and
in
my
judgment
more
important
than
the
price
of
gas
to
the
consumers
in
california.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
more
important
question
is,
what
will
be
the
day
when
the
consumers
of
california
will
it
--
be
able
to
buy
gas,
be
unable
to
buy
gas
from
the
permian
basin
at
any
price.
the
question
then
of
course
is
conservation.
now,
we
have
to
remember
that
in
the
discussion
yesterday,
it
was
pointed
out
that
two-thirds
of
all
gas
produced
in
the
permian
basin
is
casinghead
gas.
that
is
to
say
gas
produced
in
conjunction
with
oil.
casinghead
gas
is
somewhat
different
form
a
gas-well
gas,
and
that
it
must
be
produced
at
the
same
time
that
the
oil
is
produced.
when
you
produce
the
oil,
you
must
by
necessity
produce
the
gas.
at
that
point,
two
things
can
be
done
with
the
gas.
one,
it
can
be
marketed
if
the
cost
involved
in
gathering
it
and
bringing
it
up
to
pipeline
standards
are
--
the
price
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
cost.
or
two,
it
can
be
vented
to
the
atmosphere
and
flared.
now
new
mexico
in
the
1930s,
along
with
texas
were
the
leaders
in
the
conservation
measures
in
the
hydrocarbon
field.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
on
casinghead
gas.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
new
mexico
and
texas
led
the
nation
in
conservation
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
in
the
early
1930s,
we
passed
a
statute
empowering
our
oil
conservation
commission
to
prohibit
the
flaring
of
gas.
now
we
permitted
them
to
flare
gas
for
some
period
of
time
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
was
uneconomical
to
gather
at
that
point
because
the
price
was
insufficient
to
justify
the
cost.
but
almost
two
decades
ago,
new
mexico
has
prohibited
producers
from
flaring
casinghead
gas.
we
have
--
we
did
so,
because
at
that
point,
the
price
became
economic
enough
that
we
could
force
them
to
market
and
gather
it.
now
this
is
in
contradistinction
of
california.
california
had
great
and
vast
reserves
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
and
today,
they
are
barren.
and
i
must
say
that
california
appeared
before
you
yesterday
as
a
consumer
state
as
it
must
because
its
hydrocarbon
energy
now
has
been
wasted,
it
has
perhaps
lead
the
nation
in
lack
of
conservation
practices.
so
what
appears
before
this
court
today,
or
yesterday,
and
ask
this
court
to
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
a
decision
of
this
--
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
will
be
the
seed
which
might
well
destroy
new
mexico's
conservation
practices.
now
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
there
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
conservation
measures
in
california.
but
california
has
never
adopted
the
well
spacing
regulations,
has
never
adopted
the
proration
theory
which
we
think
are
so
necessary
to
the
conservation
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct.
but
i
think
it
is
a
--
so
clear
that
this
court
may
take
judicial
knowledge
of
it
that
california
has
not
done
nearly
the
job
on
conservation
of
its
hydrocarbon
energies
as
--
that
new
mexico
and
texas
have
done.
i
think
testimony
of
the
fact
that
their
hydrocarbon
energy
is
largely
expanded
at
this
point,
it
is
proved
of
the
point.
now,
if
we
--
now
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this,
we
are
not
standing
here
saying
that
the
price
the
commission
set
for
casinghead
gas
will
--
is
at
that
point,
where
it
is
uneconomic
to
produce
it
any
longer.
we
think
it
--
that
may
be
the
case
but
we're
not
here
saying
that's
the
case.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
appeared
in
new
mexico
as
well
as
texas
appeared
before
the
commission
and
that
offered
testimony
as
to
what
effect
their
decision
would
have
on
new
mexico's
conservation
practices.
as
general
martin
pointed
out
that
testimony
was
rejected.
we
appeared
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
again
urged
our
position
on
the
conservation
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
again,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
our
offer
of
proof.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
conservation
is
not
a
parochial
issue
to
new
mexico,
indeed
it
is
an
issue
of
vital
interest
to
the
nation.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir?
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
the
problem
is,
if
they
set
the
price
of
casinghead
gas
at
a
point
so
low
that
it
is
uneconomical
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
--
to
harvest
its
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we're
not
saying
that
they
have
reached
that
point.
we're
saying
they
did
not
consider
our
offer
of
testimony
on
that
point.
and
we
think
the
question
of
conservation
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
public
interest
under
the
national
gas
act.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
because
if
it
is
uneconomic,
at
a
price
to
gather
and
produce
the
gas,
the
companies
are
going
to
flare
it.
they
won't
go
to
the
expense
of
gathering
the
gas
and
putting
it
into
the
market,
(voice
overlap)
flared
it
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we're
talking
about
casinghead
gas.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
which
constitutes
two-thirds
of
the
permian
basin.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
they
will
flare
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
if
we
refuse
to
permit
them
to
flare
it
and
they
cannot
recover
their
cost
by
marketing
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
our
--
that
the
order
of
our
conservation
commission
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct
(voice
overlap).
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
however
much
we
would
like
to
consider
this
testimony,
we
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
hope
case.
because
the
hope
case
said,
the
interest
of
the
producing
states
is
not
a
part
of
the
public
interest.
now,
our
point
as
general
martin
pointed
out
is,
we
think
the
evolution
of
the
law
has
progressed
further
than
that
at
this
time.
we
think
conservation
is
a
national
issue.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
do
not
say
here
that
the
rate
they
set
for
casinghead
gas
will
cause
this
effect.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
are
saying
the
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir
for
this
reason.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
only
as
conserve
--
there
is
no
federal
authority
to
conserve
hydrocarbon
energy
in
new
mexico.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
we
say
we
don't
know,
we
think
this
rate
may
reach
this
point.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
would
like
to
go
in
and
offer
our
testimony
on
the
impact
of
this
decision,
how
important
it
is.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
and
it
was
not
considered
because
they
said
we
cannot
under
the
hope
case.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
think
the
commission
when
it
decided
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
we
offered
it
--
we
offered
testimony
that
whatever
price
they
established
would
have
a
profound
effect
upon
conservation
in
new
mexico
which
is
directly
related
to
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
we
say
--
we
are
saying
we
don't
know
at
this
point
because
nobody
can
tell.
we're
--
all
i
am
saying
to
the
court
is
that
in
considering
what
is
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
we
don't
know
whether
they
can
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir.
because
--
now
we're
talking
about
two
different
questions,
casinghead
gas
they
said
we
are
going
to
set
it
14
and
a
half
cents.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
but
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
now
--
that's
not
going
to
be
the
actual
rate
mr.
justice.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
i
--
on
what
the
--
in
fact
rate,
on
casinghead
gas
will
be
in
the
permian
basin
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
rate
they
set
in
the
order
because
as
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
sir?
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right.
the
price
will
be
closer
to
9
cents
than
it
will
be
closer
to
14.
and
we
think
on
that
basis
we
may
very
well
get
to
the
position
where
the
companies
are
going
to
come
to
us
and
say
we
can't
make
a
profit
on
the
casinghead
gas
because
of
the
adjustments.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
only
are
interested,
it
seems
to
me
they're
the
interest
of
the
nation.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
our
--
new
mexico's
interest
are
not
damaged
but
if
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
only
and
that
can
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
boston
witt.
i'm
the
attorney
general
of
new
mexico.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
new
mexico
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
order.
now,
the
court
please
i
could
stand
here
during
my
allotted
time
and
commiserate
about
how
much
tax
money
this
decision
will
cost
new
mexico.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
far
more
important
question
at
issue
here.
far
more
important
than
any
tax
lost
to
new
mexico.
even
more
important
than
any
profit,
to
any
company
involved
in
this
case
and
in
my
judgment
more
important
than
the
price
of
gas
to
the
consumers
in
california.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
more
important
question
is,
what
will
be
the
day
when
the
consumers
of
california
will
it
--
be
able
to
buy
gas,
be
unable
to
buy
gas
from
the
permian
basin
at
any
price.
the
question
then
of
course
is
conservation.
now,
we
have
to
remember
that
in
the
discussion
yesterday,
it
was
pointed
out
that
two-thirds
of
all
gas
produced
in
the
permian
basin
is
casinghead
gas.
that
is
to
say
gas
produced
in
conjunction
with
oil.
casinghead
gas
is
somewhat
different
form
a
gas-well
gas,
and
that
it
must
be
produced
at
the
same
time
that
the
oil
is
produced.
when
you
produce
the
oil,
you
must
by
necessity
produce
the
gas.
at
that
point,
two
things
can
be
done
with
the
gas.
one,
it
can
be
marketed
if
the
cost
involved
in
gathering
it
and
bringing
it
up
to
pipeline
standards
are
--
the
price
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
cost.
or
two,
it
can
be
vented
to
the
atmosphere
and
flared.
now
new
mexico
in
the
1930s,
along
with
texas
were
the
leaders
in
the
conservation
measures
in
the
hydrocarbon
field.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
on
casinghead
gas.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
new
mexico
and
texas
led
the
nation
in
conservation
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
in
the
early
1930s,
we
passed
a
statute
empowering
our
oil
conservation
commission
to
prohibit
the
flaring
of
gas.
now
we
permitted
them
to
flare
gas
for
some
period
of
time
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
was
uneconomical
to
gather
at
that
point
because
the
price
was
insufficient
to
justify
the
cost.
but
almost
two
decades
ago,
new
mexico
has
prohibited
producers
from
flaring
casinghead
gas.
we
have
--
we
did
so,
because
at
that
point,
the
price
became
economic
enough
that
we
could
force
them
to
market
and
gather
it.
now
this
is
in
contradistinction
of
california.
california
had
great
and
vast
reserves
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
and
today,
they
are
barren.
and
i
must
say
that
california
appeared
before
you
yesterday
as
a
consumer
state
as
it
must
because
its
hydrocarbon
energy
now
has
been
wasted,
it
has
perhaps
lead
the
nation
in
lack
of
conservation
practices.
so
what
appears
before
this
court
today,
or
yesterday,
and
ask
this
court
to
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
a
decision
of
this
--
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
will
be
the
seed
which
might
well
destroy
new
mexico's
conservation
practices.
now
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
there
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
conservation
measures
in
california.
but
california
has
never
adopted
the
well
spacing
regulations,
has
never
adopted
the
proration
theory
which
we
think
are
so
necessary
to
the
conservation
of
hydrocarbon
energy.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct.
but
i
think
it
is
a
--
so
clear
that
this
court
may
take
judicial
knowledge
of
it
that
california
has
not
done
nearly
the
job
on
conservation
of
its
hydrocarbon
energies
as
--
that
new
mexico
and
texas
have
done.
i
think
testimony
of
the
fact
that
their
hydrocarbon
energy
is
largely
expanded
at
this
point,
it
is
proved
of
the
point.
now,
if
we
--
now
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this,
we
are
not
standing
here
saying
that
the
price
the
commission
set
for
casinghead
gas
will
--
is
at
that
point,
where
it
is
uneconomic
to
produce
it
any
longer.
we
think
it
--
that
may
be
the
case
but
we're
not
here
saying
that's
the
case.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
appeared
in
new
mexico
as
well
as
texas
appeared
before
the
commission
and
that
offered
testimony
as
to
what
effect
their
decision
would
have
on
new
mexico's
conservation
practices.
as
general
martin
pointed
out
that
testimony
was
rejected.
we
appeared
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
again
urged
our
position
on
the
conservation
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
again,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
our
offer
of
proof.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
conservation
is
not
a
parochial
issue
to
new
mexico,
indeed
it
is
an
issue
of
vital
interest
to
the
nation.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir?
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
the
problem
is,
if
they
set
the
price
of
casinghead
gas
at
a
point
so
low
that
it
is
uneconomical
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
--
to
harvest
its
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we're
not
saying
that
they
have
reached
that
point.
we're
saying
they
did
not
consider
our
offer
of
testimony
on
that
point.
and
we
think
the
question
of
conservation
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
public
interest
under
the
national
gas
act.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
because
if
it
is
uneconomic,
at
a
price
to
gather
and
produce
the
gas,
the
companies
are
going
to
flare
it.
they
won't
go
to
the
expense
of
gathering
the
gas
and
putting
it
into
the
market,
(voice
overlap)
flared
it
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we're
talking
about
casinghead
gas.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
which
constitutes
two-thirds
of
the
permian
basin.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
they
will
flare
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
if
we
refuse
to
permit
them
to
flare
it
and
they
cannot
recover
their
cost
by
marketing
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
our
--
that
the
order
of
our
conservation
commission
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
correct
(voice
overlap).
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
however
much
we
would
like
to
consider
this
testimony,
we
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
hope
case.
because
the
hope
case
said,
the
interest
of
the
producing
states
is
not
a
part
of
the
public
interest.
now,
our
point
as
general
martin
pointed
out
is,
we
think
the
evolution
of
the
law
has
progressed
further
than
that
at
this
time.
we
think
conservation
is
a
national
issue.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
do
not
say
here
that
the
rate
they
set
for
casinghead
gas
will
cause
this
effect.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
are
saying
the
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir
for
this
reason.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
only
as
conserve
--
there
is
no
federal
authority
to
conserve
hydrocarbon
energy
in
new
mexico.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
we
say
we
don't
know,
we
think
this
rate
may
reach
this
point.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
would
like
to
go
in
and
offer
our
testimony
on
the
impact
of
this
decision,
how
important
it
is.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
and
it
was
not
considered
because
they
said
we
cannot
under
the
hope
case.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
we
think
the
commission
when
it
decided
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir,
we
offered
it
--
we
offered
testimony
that
whatever
price
they
established
would
have
a
profound
effect
upon
conservation
in
new
mexico
which
is
directly
related
to
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
we
say
--
we
are
saying
we
don't
know
at
this
point
because
nobody
can
tell.
we're
--
all
i
am
saying
to
the
court
is
that
in
considering
what
is
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
we
don't
know
whether
they
can
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
yes
sir.
because
--
now
we're
talking
about
two
different
questions,
casinghead
gas
they
said
we
are
going
to
set
it
14
and
a
half
cents.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
but
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
now
--
that's
not
going
to
be
the
actual
rate
mr.
justice.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well
i
--
on
what
the
--
in
fact
rate,
on
casinghead
gas
will
be
in
the
permian
basin
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
rate
they
set
in
the
order
because
as
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
sir?
mr.
boston
e.
witt
that's
right.
the
price
will
be
closer
to
9
cents
than
it
will
be
closer
to
14.
and
we
think
on
that
basis
we
may
very
well
get
to
the
position
where
the
companies
are
going
to
come
to
us
and
say
we
can't
make
a
profit
on
the
casinghead
gas
because
of
the
adjustments.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
not
only
are
interested,
it
seems
to
me
they're
the
interest
of
the
nation.
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
our
--
new
mexico's
interest
are
not
damaged
but
if
--
mr.
boston
e.
witt
well,
only
and
that
can
--
