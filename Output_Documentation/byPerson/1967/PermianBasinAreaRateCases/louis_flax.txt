mr.
louis
flax
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
louis
flax
and
i
represent
sun
oil
company.
sun's
briefs
are
those
covered
with
the
green
cover
include
a
rather
thick
principle
brief
inside.
mr.
solomon,
in
his
opening
yesterday,
said
that
a
--
said
that
this
case
is
important,
of
a
legal
framework
of
all
other
producer
cases.
we
say
however,
that
it's
important
for
more
than
the
legal
framework
of
producer
cases,
it
is
important
for
the
whole
legal
framework
of
regulatory
law
because
what
we
have
here
is
not
producers
as
a
world
apart.
we
have
many
determinations
of
this
court
as
to
what
is
just
and
reasonable,
as
to
what
is
confiscation
and
we
say
these
determinations
are
applicable
to
an
area
rate
even
though
it
deals
with
producers.
sun's
position
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
natural
gas
act
require
that
the
federal
power
commission
give
consideration
to
the
individual
in
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
the
act.
and
that
this
consideration
is
to
be
in
the
form
of
rate
that
permit
the
individual
to
recover
as
a
minimum.
it
cost
the
service
made
up
of
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges.
this
however
does
not
mean
that
separate
findings
need
be
made
as
to
each
individual
in
a
group.
instead,
individual
rights
maybe
reconciled
with
those
of
the
group
in
a
cost
method
of
regulation.
by
use
of
evidence
that
is
typical
and
representative
of
the
individuals
in
the
group
and
by
providing
for
an
effective
and
viable
savings
cost.
the
federal
power
commission
in
its
permian
opinion
however,
has
neither
recognized
nor
applied
these
principles.
and
for
this
reason
we
say
that
its
action
should
be
reversed
in
its
entirety.
in
the
time
i
have
available,
i
want
to
make
four
points
in
support
of
this
position.
i
shall
try
to
avoid
repetition
but
sometimes
in
order
to
make
a
complete
presentation
might
be
necessary
to
what
appears
would
be
repetition.
first,
it
is
fundamental
that
the
federal
power
commission
must
consider
the
effect
the
rates
fixed
on
the
individual.
the
individual
producers
have
very
extensive
investments
and
constitutionally,
these
investments
will
be
confiscated
by
inadequate
rates.
this
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
tag
brothers
in
the
market
agency
cases
in
which
they
distinguished
the
need
for
confiscation
in
a
utility
type
case
as
opposed
to
this
market
agency
type
case
where
there
was
no
investment,
it
was
just
simply
the
operating
expenses
we're
involved.
also
the
individual
has
a
continuing
obligation
to
sell
and
it
is
not
free
to
terminate
by
reason
of
the
aban
--
by
reason
of
the
abandonment
section
of
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
as
applied
by
this
--
by
the
federal
power
commission
on
a
number
of
cases
as
cited
in
our
brief
contrary
to
the
statements
of
mr.
solomon
to
which
i
would
say
would've
given
the
impression
that
the
commission
just
simply
let's
people
out
of
their
contracts
and
out
of
their
obligation
to
sell
at
will.
now
in
addition,
the
natural
gas
act
is
predicated
on
the
commerce
power
and
not
the
war
power
as
was
the
case
of
group
ratemaking
under
war
pri
--
war
time
price
control.
from
a
statutory
standpoint
the
underlying
rights
of
the
individual
are
indicated
by
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
by
a
contrast
with
this
statute,
with
statutes
that
were
advisably
designed
for
group
ratemaking
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
transport
--
and
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938
which
was
virtually
contemporaneously
the
natural
gas
act.
in
addition
as
has
been
mentioned,
this
court
in
bowles
v.
willingham
recognized
that
under
the
act,
the
rates
that
fixed
must
be
just
and
reasonable
as
to
particular
person's
incompetence.
we
now
come
to
my
second
point
which
is
the
consideration
that
must
be
given
to
the
individual
is
that
as
a
minimum,
it
must
be
provided
rates
which
will
afford
the
opportunity
to
recover
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges.
this
assumes
of
course
that
those
cost
are
prudent
and
that
the
resulting
rates
are
within
competitive
limits.
in
the
instant
case
however,
there
is
no
evidence
of
imprudency.
in
fact
the
question
was
put
to
any
number
of
staff
witnesses,
the
commission
staff
witnesses.
have
you
seen
any
imprudency?
and
they
said
“no,
we
have
not
done
so”.
mr.
louis
flax
i'm
glad
you
asked
that,
mr.--
mr.
louis
flax
--
justice
fortas.
i
know
you
did
and
i
was
prepared
for
it.
mr.
louis
flax
i
say
this,
under
the
lindheimer
case,
one
of
the
elements
to
be
included
in
a
cost
to
service
is
the
operating
expenses.
now,
if
the
exploration
and
development
is
prudent
and
if
the
product
of
that
exploration
and
development
is
directed
to
the
public
benefit
that
is
if
it's
dedicated
to
interstate
operations
then
i
say
that's
it's
a
viable
vital
cost.
mr.
louis
flax
i
think
that
this
is
a
determination
of
whether
this
was
prudently
expanded.
mr.
louis
flax
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
louis
flax
and
the
reason
i
say
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
i
think
that
if
it's
imprudent
to
get
20
--
to
make
a
single
thrust,
to
get
20%
of
the
market
in
five
years
then
i
think
it
might
be
disallowed.
mr.
louis
flax
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
this
commission
in
opinion
468
said,
it
is
but
--
beyond
disputed
that
continuing
exploration
and
development
of
new
gas
reserves
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
we
cite
that
on
page
70
of
our
brief
further,
the
fifth
circuit
in
forest
oil
company
said
that
dry
hole
expenses
are
unavoidable
elements
of
exploration
and
development.
now
we
say
that
therein
lies
the
rule
as
for
the
allowance
of
this.
now
let's
take
this
situation
that
mr.
furbush
brought
out
where
you
find
a
138%
of
your
reserves
in
one
year.
now
what
happen
sometimes
is
the
company
might
drill
for
three
or
four
years
before
it
finds
something.
then
it
finds
a
good
find,
it
dedicates
it
to
the
public
interest
in
that
one
year
by
signing
a
20
year
pipe
--
contract
with
a
pipeline.
now
we
say
that
you
shouldn't
limit
your
company
to
just
replacing
its
reserves.
we
think
that
this
is
all
a
question
of
fact
and
that
you
can't
use
a
rule
of
thumb
on
it
and
that's
why
you
have
hearings.
and
that's
why
you
don't
do
what
the
federal
power
commission
did
in
this
case
which
is
just
simply
ask
for
reports
which
is
a
raw
reports
stated
how
much
did
you
drill
this
year
and
didn't
let
anybody
explained
what
that
meant.
and
this
is
part
of
the
whole
area
the
commission
has
met
--
mr.
louis
flax
well
--
mr.
louis
flax
i
say
your
honor
that
sun
oil
company
attempted
to
put
in
as
did
others.
mr.
louis
flax
but
the
commission
wouldn't
let
it
an
individual
cost
of
service.
and
we
say
that
these
would
be
appropriate
for
a
savings
cost
presentation.
however,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
excuse
me
--
mr.
louis
flax
what
that
would
show
is
that
on
sun's
views
of
it's
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges
the
rates
provided
will
not
permit
it
to
recover
those
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges
hence
it
would
be
confiscatory.
now,
let
me
say
this
as
long
as
you
brought
the
subject
up,
that
we
believed
that
in
the
first
instance
there
are
two
criteria
for
this
group
ratemaking.
in
the
first
instance,
the
commission
had
to
find
that
the
evidence
it
used
was
typical
and
representative
of
the
individuals
in
the
group.
now
this
is
just
a
straight
regulatory
law
of
the
commission.
this
court
has
applied
it.
it
approved
it
last
term
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
for
the
fixing
of
group
divisions.
there
have
been
other
cases
where
the
court
has
recognized
the
identity
of
the
individual
and
the
group.
now
we
say
that's
the
proper
test
that
was
kept
along
and
represented
as
evidence.
the
commission
didn't
do
that
and
on
that
basis
alone,
we
say
it
should
be
reversed
as
this
court
reversed
the
icc
in
the
orient
case,
the
u.s.
v.
abilene,
southern
at
265
u.s.
however,
there
is
the
second
element
that
if
the
commission
had
found
properly
that
it
had
typical
and
representative
evidence,
the
second
element
to
our
presentation
or
to
the
fundamentals
to
group
ratemaking
under
this
statute
is
providing
a
viable
and
effective
savings
cost.
and
we
say
one
of
the
elements
of
the
savings
cost
is
permitting
an
individual
company
to
show
that
it
would
be
confiscated
by
the
rates
that
are
being
fixed.
and
when
i
say
confiscated,
i
mean
confiscation
on
an
overall
basis
because
this
court
has
found
that
confiscation
is
an
overall
company
concept.
now
from
what
i
have
stated,
we
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
cost
were
imprudent.
there
is
no
basis
for
mr.
solomon
to
seek
to
equate
a
producer
whose
cost
exceed
the
average
as
being
some
way
imprudent
hence
the
commission
takes
the
view
that
you
can
just
simply
ignore
their
costs.
and
mr.
furbush
yesterday
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
go
bankrupt.
we
say
that
the
producers
are
not
strangers
to
bankruptcy.
and
that
many
producers
have
gone
bankrupt
by
the
normal
forces
of
competition,
their
ability
to
find
gas,
their
ability
to
sell
the
gas,
and
that's
one
thing.
but
when
they
go
bankrupt
because
the
federal
power
commission
fixed
a
rate
which
refuse
to
consider
their
individual
costs
and
reduce
their
revenues
and
for
that
reason
they
go
bankrupt,
we
say
this
is
confiscation.
we
say
that
this
minimum
of
operating
expenses
from
capital
charges
has
been
held
by
this
court.
the
commission
says
however
it
needs
only
balance
in
consumer
and
investor
interest.
however,
if
you
re
--
and
may
cite
for
that
justice
black's
concurrence
in
natural
gas
pipe.
but
if
you
read
that
concurrence
in
full
context
and
if
you
read
the
hope
case,
the
colorado
interstate
case,
the
statement
is
that
imbalancing
that
interest,
the
minimum
investor
interest
is
its
operating
expenses
in
capital
charges.
my
third
point
is
the
need
for
identity
between
group
and
individual.
in
u.s.
v.
borden,
a
1962
decision
of
this
court
there
was
involved
cost
justification
for
price
differentials
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
the
concurrence
urged
that
the
cost
justification
should
be
on
an
individual
basis.
the
majority
however
held
that
--
bound
that
it
could
be
on
a
group
basis
if
there
was
a
“self
saneness”
of
the
individuals
in
the
group.
now
we
say
this
principle
is
the
same
thing
the
icc
has
applied
in
its
division's
cases
and
in
its
group
ratemaking
cases
where
it
used
typical
and
representative
evidence
and
provided
the
savings
cost.
my
fourth
point
was
that
the
commission
had
not
give
in
effect
or
considered
the
typicality
or
representative
a
--
ness
of
the
evidence
or
had
prov
--
had
not
provided
any--
an
adequate
savings
cost.
i
have
to
skip
over
the
details
including
some
good
answers
i
had
to
mr.
solomon
for
some
of
his
statements
yesterday
because
i
want
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
savings
cost.
as
i
said,
in
the
first
place
we
say
that
the
commission,
the
typicality
of
the
representativeness
is
the
first
criteria.
the
commission
has
not
found
it
and
therefore
it
should
be
reversed
on
that
basis.
however,
as
to
the
savings
cost,
the
commission's
view
of
a
savings
cost
is
apparently
--
in
the
one
instance
it
says
that's
unnecessary
to
its
method
of
regulation.
on
the
other
hand
it
refers
to
the
savings
cost
throughout
its
brief
as
apparently
a
catchall
to
foster
the
impression
that
no
matter
the
inequities
of
its
method,
sooner
or
later
justice
will
be
done.
the
fact
is
however
although
the
operation
of
savings
cost
is
not
to
any
extent
explained,
enough
is
said
to
show
that
the
savings
cost
that
the
commission
proposes
is
nothing
like
the
savings
cost
that
this
court
recognized
as
recently
in
its
last
term
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
commission
views
the
savings
cost
only
as
a
matter
to
be
heard
at
a
distant
future.
and
it
even
resists
a
stay
pending
that
determination.
on
the
other
hand,
the
icc
makes
the
savings
cost
an
intrical
part
of
its
determination.
in
fact,
the
argument
was
made
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
that
a
company
had
not
made
their
savings
cost
presentation
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
and
therefore
they
were
stopped.
in
further
contrast,
our
opinion
468
clearly
states
that
the
savings
cost
will
not
permit
the
individual
to
show
that
he
is
atypical.
also
it
will
not
permit
the
individual
to
show
that
he
is
being
confiscated.
now
mr.
solomon
referred
to
out
of
pocket
expenses.
now
out
of
pocket
expenses
are
not
the
measure
of
confiscation
because
there
wouldn't
be
included
return,
there
wouldn't
be
included
depreciation,
there
wouldn't
be
included
overhead.
it's
just
simply
a
question
if
you're
ready
to
go
out
of
business,
you
can't
even
make
your
out
of
pocket
expenses.
the
distinction
between
out
of
pocket
expenses
and
confiscation
has
also
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
b
&
o
railroad
case,
298
u.s.
so
we
say
that
the
commission
has
advisably
said
--
as
it
stated
as
we
pointed
out
that
it
will
not
use
confiscation
as
a
measure
of
a
savings
cost.
further,
it
has
indicated
by
its
moratorium
that
it
won't
consider
changed
facts
and
conditions.
and
this
is
one
of
the
other
elements
of
its
savings
cost
to
permit
the
individual
if
he
has
changed
facts
and
conditions
to
show
them.
i
note
my
time
is
up.
mr.
louis
flax
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
louis
flax
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
louis
flax
and
i
represent
sun
oil
company.
sun's
briefs
are
those
covered
with
the
green
cover
include
a
rather
thick
principle
brief
inside.
mr.
solomon,
in
his
opening
yesterday,
said
that
a
--
said
that
this
case
is
important,
of
a
legal
framework
of
all
other
producer
cases.
we
say
however,
that
it's
important
for
more
than
the
legal
framework
of
producer
cases,
it
is
important
for
the
whole
legal
framework
of
regulatory
law
because
what
we
have
here
is
not
producers
as
a
world
apart.
we
have
many
determinations
of
this
court
as
to
what
is
just
and
reasonable,
as
to
what
is
confiscation
and
we
say
these
determinations
are
applicable
to
an
area
rate
even
though
it
deals
with
producers.
sun's
position
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
natural
gas
act
require
that
the
federal
power
commission
give
consideration
to
the
individual
in
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
the
act.
and
that
this
consideration
is
to
be
in
the
form
of
rate
that
permit
the
individual
to
recover
as
a
minimum.
it
cost
the
service
made
up
of
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges.
this
however
does
not
mean
that
separate
findings
need
be
made
as
to
each
individual
in
a
group.
instead,
individual
rights
maybe
reconciled
with
those
of
the
group
in
a
cost
method
of
regulation.
by
use
of
evidence
that
is
typical
and
representative
of
the
individuals
in
the
group
and
by
providing
for
an
effective
and
viable
savings
cost.
the
federal
power
commission
in
its
permian
opinion
however,
has
neither
recognized
nor
applied
these
principles.
and
for
this
reason
we
say
that
its
action
should
be
reversed
in
its
entirety.
in
the
time
i
have
available,
i
want
to
make
four
points
in
support
of
this
position.
i
shall
try
to
avoid
repetition
but
sometimes
in
order
to
make
a
complete
presentation
might
be
necessary
to
what
appears
would
be
repetition.
first,
it
is
fundamental
that
the
federal
power
commission
must
consider
the
effect
the
rates
fixed
on
the
individual.
the
individual
producers
have
very
extensive
investments
and
constitutionally,
these
investments
will
be
confiscated
by
inadequate
rates.
this
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
tag
brothers
in
the
market
agency
cases
in
which
they
distinguished
the
need
for
confiscation
in
a
utility
type
case
as
opposed
to
this
market
agency
type
case
where
there
was
no
investment,
it
was
just
simply
the
operating
expenses
we're
involved.
also
the
individual
has
a
continuing
obligation
to
sell
and
it
is
not
free
to
terminate
by
reason
of
the
aban
--
by
reason
of
the
abandonment
section
of
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
as
applied
by
this
--
by
the
federal
power
commission
on
a
number
of
cases
as
cited
in
our
brief
contrary
to
the
statements
of
mr.
solomon
to
which
i
would
say
would've
given
the
impression
that
the
commission
just
simply
let's
people
out
of
their
contracts
and
out
of
their
obligation
to
sell
at
will.
now
in
addition,
the
natural
gas
act
is
predicated
on
the
commerce
power
and
not
the
war
power
as
was
the
case
of
group
ratemaking
under
war
pri
--
war
time
price
control.
from
a
statutory
standpoint
the
underlying
rights
of
the
individual
are
indicated
by
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
by
a
contrast
with
this
statute,
with
statutes
that
were
advisably
designed
for
group
ratemaking
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
transport
--
and
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938
which
was
virtually
contemporaneously
the
natural
gas
act.
in
addition
as
has
been
mentioned,
this
court
in
bowles
v.
willingham
recognized
that
under
the
act,
the
rates
that
fixed
must
be
just
and
reasonable
as
to
particular
person's
incompetence.
we
now
come
to
my
second
point
which
is
the
consideration
that
must
be
given
to
the
individual
is
that
as
a
minimum,
it
must
be
provided
rates
which
will
afford
the
opportunity
to
recover
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges.
this
assumes
of
course
that
those
cost
are
prudent
and
that
the
resulting
rates
are
within
competitive
limits.
in
the
instant
case
however,
there
is
no
evidence
of
imprudency.
in
fact
the
question
was
put
to
any
number
of
staff
witnesses,
the
commission
staff
witnesses.
have
you
seen
any
imprudency?
and
they
said
“no,
we
have
not
done
so”.
mr.
louis
flax
i'm
glad
you
asked
that,
mr.--
mr.
louis
flax
--
justice
fortas.
i
know
you
did
and
i
was
prepared
for
it.
mr.
louis
flax
i
say
this,
under
the
lindheimer
case,
one
of
the
elements
to
be
included
in
a
cost
to
service
is
the
operating
expenses.
now,
if
the
exploration
and
development
is
prudent
and
if
the
product
of
that
exploration
and
development
is
directed
to
the
public
benefit
that
is
if
it's
dedicated
to
interstate
operations
then
i
say
that's
it's
a
viable
vital
cost.
mr.
louis
flax
i
think
that
this
is
a
determination
of
whether
this
was
prudently
expanded.
mr.
louis
flax
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
louis
flax
and
the
reason
i
say
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
i
think
that
if
it's
imprudent
to
get
20
--
to
make
a
single
thrust,
to
get
20%
of
the
market
in
five
years
then
i
think
it
might
be
disallowed.
mr.
louis
flax
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
this
commission
in
opinion
468
said,
it
is
but
--
beyond
disputed
that
continuing
exploration
and
development
of
new
gas
reserves
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
we
cite
that
on
page
70
of
our
brief
further,
the
fifth
circuit
in
forest
oil
company
said
that
dry
hole
expenses
are
unavoidable
elements
of
exploration
and
development.
now
we
say
that
therein
lies
the
rule
as
for
the
allowance
of
this.
now
let's
take
this
situation
that
mr.
furbush
brought
out
where
you
find
a
138%
of
your
reserves
in
one
year.
now
what
happen
sometimes
is
the
company
might
drill
for
three
or
four
years
before
it
finds
something.
then
it
finds
a
good
find,
it
dedicates
it
to
the
public
interest
in
that
one
year
by
signing
a
20
year
pipe
--
contract
with
a
pipeline.
now
we
say
that
you
shouldn't
limit
your
company
to
just
replacing
its
reserves.
we
think
that
this
is
all
a
question
of
fact
and
that
you
can't
use
a
rule
of
thumb
on
it
and
that's
why
you
have
hearings.
and
that's
why
you
don't
do
what
the
federal
power
commission
did
in
this
case
which
is
just
simply
ask
for
reports
which
is
a
raw
reports
stated
how
much
did
you
drill
this
year
and
didn't
let
anybody
explained
what
that
meant.
and
this
is
part
of
the
whole
area
the
commission
has
met
--
mr.
louis
flax
well
--
mr.
louis
flax
i
say
your
honor
that
sun
oil
company
attempted
to
put
in
as
did
others.
mr.
louis
flax
but
the
commission
wouldn't
let
it
an
individual
cost
of
service.
and
we
say
that
these
would
be
appropriate
for
a
savings
cost
presentation.
however,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
louis
flax
well,
excuse
me
--
mr.
louis
flax
what
that
would
show
is
that
on
sun's
views
of
it's
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges
the
rates
provided
will
not
permit
it
to
recover
those
operating
expenses
and
capital
charges
hence
it
would
be
confiscatory.
now,
let
me
say
this
as
long
as
you
brought
the
subject
up,
that
we
believed
that
in
the
first
instance
there
are
two
criteria
for
this
group
ratemaking.
in
the
first
instance,
the
commission
had
to
find
that
the
evidence
it
used
was
typical
and
representative
of
the
individuals
in
the
group.
now
this
is
just
a
straight
regulatory
law
of
the
commission.
this
court
has
applied
it.
it
approved
it
last
term
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
for
the
fixing
of
group
divisions.
there
have
been
other
cases
where
the
court
has
recognized
the
identity
of
the
individual
and
the
group.
now
we
say
that's
the
proper
test
that
was
kept
along
and
represented
as
evidence.
the
commission
didn't
do
that
and
on
that
basis
alone,
we
say
it
should
be
reversed
as
this
court
reversed
the
icc
in
the
orient
case,
the
u.s.
v.
abilene,
southern
at
265
u.s.
however,
there
is
the
second
element
that
if
the
commission
had
found
properly
that
it
had
typical
and
representative
evidence,
the
second
element
to
our
presentation
or
to
the
fundamentals
to
group
ratemaking
under
this
statute
is
providing
a
viable
and
effective
savings
cost.
and
we
say
one
of
the
elements
of
the
savings
cost
is
permitting
an
individual
company
to
show
that
it
would
be
confiscated
by
the
rates
that
are
being
fixed.
and
when
i
say
confiscated,
i
mean
confiscation
on
an
overall
basis
because
this
court
has
found
that
confiscation
is
an
overall
company
concept.
now
from
what
i
have
stated,
we
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
cost
were
imprudent.
there
is
no
basis
for
mr.
solomon
to
seek
to
equate
a
producer
whose
cost
exceed
the
average
as
being
some
way
imprudent
hence
the
commission
takes
the
view
that
you
can
just
simply
ignore
their
costs.
and
mr.
furbush
yesterday
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
go
bankrupt.
we
say
that
the
producers
are
not
strangers
to
bankruptcy.
and
that
many
producers
have
gone
bankrupt
by
the
normal
forces
of
competition,
their
ability
to
find
gas,
their
ability
to
sell
the
gas,
and
that's
one
thing.
but
when
they
go
bankrupt
because
the
federal
power
commission
fixed
a
rate
which
refuse
to
consider
their
individual
costs
and
reduce
their
revenues
and
for
that
reason
they
go
bankrupt,
we
say
this
is
confiscation.
we
say
that
this
minimum
of
operating
expenses
from
capital
charges
has
been
held
by
this
court.
the
commission
says
however
it
needs
only
balance
in
consumer
and
investor
interest.
however,
if
you
re
--
and
may
cite
for
that
justice
black's
concurrence
in
natural
gas
pipe.
but
if
you
read
that
concurrence
in
full
context
and
if
you
read
the
hope
case,
the
colorado
interstate
case,
the
statement
is
that
imbalancing
that
interest,
the
minimum
investor
interest
is
its
operating
expenses
in
capital
charges.
my
third
point
is
the
need
for
identity
between
group
and
individual.
in
u.s.
v.
borden,
a
1962
decision
of
this
court
there
was
involved
cost
justification
for
price
differentials
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
the
concurrence
urged
that
the
cost
justification
should
be
on
an
individual
basis.
the
majority
however
held
that
--
bound
that
it
could
be
on
a
group
basis
if
there
was
a
“self
saneness”
of
the
individuals
in
the
group.
now
we
say
this
principle
is
the
same
thing
the
icc
has
applied
in
its
division's
cases
and
in
its
group
ratemaking
cases
where
it
used
typical
and
representative
evidence
and
provided
the
savings
cost.
my
fourth
point
was
that
the
commission
had
not
give
in
effect
or
considered
the
typicality
or
representative
a
--
ness
of
the
evidence
or
had
prov
--
had
not
provided
any--
an
adequate
savings
cost.
i
have
to
skip
over
the
details
including
some
good
answers
i
had
to
mr.
solomon
for
some
of
his
statements
yesterday
because
i
want
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
savings
cost.
as
i
said,
in
the
first
place
we
say
that
the
commission,
the
typicality
of
the
representativeness
is
the
first
criteria.
the
commission
has
not
found
it
and
therefore
it
should
be
reversed
on
that
basis.
however,
as
to
the
savings
cost,
the
commission's
view
of
a
savings
cost
is
apparently
--
in
the
one
instance
it
says
that's
unnecessary
to
its
method
of
regulation.
on
the
other
hand
it
refers
to
the
savings
cost
throughout
its
brief
as
apparently
a
catchall
to
foster
the
impression
that
no
matter
the
inequities
of
its
method,
sooner
or
later
justice
will
be
done.
the
fact
is
however
although
the
operation
of
savings
cost
is
not
to
any
extent
explained,
enough
is
said
to
show
that
the
savings
cost
that
the
commission
proposes
is
nothing
like
the
savings
cost
that
this
court
recognized
as
recently
in
its
last
term
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
commission
views
the
savings
cost
only
as
a
matter
to
be
heard
at
a
distant
future.
and
it
even
resists
a
stay
pending
that
determination.
on
the
other
hand,
the
icc
makes
the
savings
cost
an
intrical
part
of
its
determination.
in
fact,
the
argument
was
made
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
that
a
company
had
not
made
their
savings
cost
presentation
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
and
therefore
they
were
stopped.
in
further
contrast,
our
opinion
468
clearly
states
that
the
savings
cost
will
not
permit
the
individual
to
show
that
he
is
atypical.
also
it
will
not
permit
the
individual
to
show
that
he
is
being
confiscated.
now
mr.
solomon
referred
to
out
of
pocket
expenses.
now
out
of
pocket
expenses
are
not
the
measure
of
confiscation
because
there
wouldn't
be
included
return,
there
wouldn't
be
included
depreciation,
there
wouldn't
be
included
overhead.
it's
just
simply
a
question
if
you're
ready
to
go
out
of
business,
you
can't
even
make
your
out
of
pocket
expenses.
the
distinction
between
out
of
pocket
expenses
and
confiscation
has
also
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
b
&
o
railroad
case,
298
u.s.
so
we
say
that
the
commission
has
advisably
said
--
as
it
stated
as
we
pointed
out
that
it
will
not
use
confiscation
as
a
measure
of
a
savings
cost.
further,
it
has
indicated
by
its
moratorium
that
it
won't
consider
changed
facts
and
conditions.
and
this
is
one
of
the
other
elements
of
its
savings
cost
to
permit
the
individual
if
he
has
changed
facts
and
conditions
to
show
them.
i
note
my
time
is
up.
mr.
louis
flax
thank
you,
your
honors.
