mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
mr.
justices,
if
it
please
the
court.
i'm
arguing
for
continental
oil
company
and
midhurst
oil
corporation.
of
the
many
extremely
important
issues
raised
in
the
permian
basin
area
rate
cases
my
argument
is
restricted
to
three
issues
which
i
believe
to
be
the
very
foundation
of
these
cases.
these
three
issues
go
to
the
theory
and
method
of
produced
regulation.
my
argument
accepts
the
legality
of
producer
regulation
on
an
area
and
a
group
basis
provided
such
regulation
is
not
arbitrary,
discriminatory
or
capricious
that
producer
petitioners
that
will
follow
me
in
argument
and
the
producers
who
are
respondents
only,
who
would
follow
them
addressed
themselves
to
different
issues.
a
conscientious
effort
has
been
made
to
ensure
that
no
issue
will
be
argued
by
more
than
one
producer
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
not
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
historically,
the
commission
had
determined
rates
on
utility
rate
base,
cost
to
service
method.
inherent
in
this
method
is
a
clear
foreseeable
relationship
as
to
any
particular
service
to
be
rendered
for
each
utility
entity
and
the
cost
of
rendering
that
service.
a
certain
number
of
dollars
will
provide
a
service
for
which
a
certain
rate
must
be
permitted.
this
is
the
heart
of
utility
regulation
and
this
system
has
worked
very
well
in
the
utility
industries.
when
this
court
held
that
the
natural
gas
act
applied
to
the
producers
of
natural
gas,
spokesman
for
this
industry
vehemently
urged
that
this
industry
was
no
count
whatever
to
a
public
utility
and
that
a
utility
method
of
regulation
could
not
successfully
be
applied
in
the
producing
industry.
the
commission
staff
urged
rejection
of
this
pleads.
after
all,
it
was
expert
in
utility
regulation
that
knew
they
were
they
method.
this
ideological
battle
weighs
for
seven
years
while
the
producers
thought
cost
to
service
regulation
and
urged
the
method
of
regulation
based
upon
the
consideration
of
the
economic
characteristics
of
and
the
economic
factors
that
work
in
the
producing
industry.
producers
argued
first
that
the
cost
of
gas
cannot
be
determined
like
the
cost
of
public
utility
service
with
little
joint
cause
but
for
gas
in
a
joint
product
with
oil
and
with
natural
gas
liquids
the
best
that
could
be
done
was
to
estimate
the
cost
of
gas
using
some
cost
in
formula
in
flowing
wholly
arbitrary
allocation
method
that
allocates
the
joint
cause.
in
no
real
sense
could
the
cost
of
gas
actually
be
determined.
the
producers
argued
second
that
the
commission
owed
a
duty
to
induce
an
adequate
continuing
supply
of
gas
for
the
interstate
consumer
and
that
even
if
the
cost
of
gas
could
be
determined,
a
cost
determined
rate
could
not
perform
the
function
of
a
listening
supply
due
to
the
lack
of
relationship
between
expenditures
and
results.
the
forcibility,
the
dollars
of
input,
the
output
and
the
rate
that
would
provide
an
adequate
return
so
characteristic
in
the
utilities
was
absent
in
the
producer
industry.
nonetheless,
during
these
seven
years,
the
utility
rate
based
cost
of
service
method
was
employed
by
the
commission
while
each
side
shamelessly
computed
cost
to
service
studies
designed
to
yield
a
desired
cost
result.
it
was
readily
apparent
that
the
joint
cost
constituted
such
a
large
percentage
of
the
total
cost
that
any
desired
cost
result
could
be
obtained
and
was
obtained.
finally,
the
commission
recognized
what
foolishness
this
was.
concurrently
with
the
second
phillips
opinion,
the
commission
issued
a
statement
of
general
policy
in
which
it
announced
it
was
abandoning
individual
regulation
in
favor
of
regulation
of
an
area
and
a
group
basis.
for
as
reasons
stated
in
the
second
phillips
that
in
the
experience
of
the
commission
and
i've
hoped
has
shown
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
traditional
original
cost,
prudent
investment
rate
base
method
of
regulating
utilities
is
not
a
sensible
or
even
a
workable
method
of
fixing
the
rates
of
independent
producers
of
natural
gas.
producers
of
natural
gas
cannot
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
properly
classified
as
traditional
public
utilities.
their
result
finally
reached
may
give
the
illusion
of
accuracy
since
mathematical
processes
are
involved
and
a
definite
prize
for
mcf
is
the
final
result.
but
such
a
result
must
be
tested
against
the
realities
of
the
marketplace.
thus,
prices
calculated
solely
on
the
cost
rate
base
principle
cannot
be
accepted
if
they
are
higher
than
a
buyer
pay
or
lower
than
the
seller
will
accept
when
an
unrealistic
result
is
reached,
they
formulate
for
allocations
must
be
changed
in
order
to
bring
about
a
reasonable
result.
the
allocation
method
has
then
become
a
means
of
supporting
a
result
already
arrived
at
rather
than
a
means
on
arriving
at
a
result
which
was
previously
unknown.
from
the
foregoing,
it
follows
that
effective
regulation
of
the
price
of
natural
gas
must
be
on
some
more
manageable
plan
than
the
rate
base
method.‚Äù
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
this
comes
from
the
second
phillips
decision
of
the
commission,
opinion
number
338,
your
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
opinion
of
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
that
was
1963
i
believe.
six
--
1960
right,
it
preceded
the
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
preceded
the
commencement
of
the
area
rate
proceeding,
yes
your
honor.
at
this
point
in
time,
the
commission
was
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
that
is
in
opinion
number
338
of
the
commission
commonly
known
as
the
second
phillips
decision.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
and
--
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
that
case
came
here.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
and
that's
the
one
of
which
you
have
found
the
commission
and
its
filings
that
it
need
not
use
cost
of
services
in
its
regulation.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
that
was
the
forerunner
of
the
permian
basin
case
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
at
this
point
in
time,
the
commission
was
completely
correct
and
was
supported
in
such
findings
by
this
court
in
its
second
phillips
act
opinion.
the
commission
found
that
true
in
an
order
ruling
on
evidence
to
be
considered
in
these
proceedings,
proscribing
cost
of
service
evidenced
on
either
individual
or
a
group
basis.
subsequently
however,
there
were
important
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
commission
and
more
than
a
year
after
the
first
ruling,
a
second
ruling
issued
in
which
cost
to
service
was
to
be
permitted
on
a
group
basis.
such
composite
studies
that
the
commission
found
may
not
suffer
from
the
same
deficiencies
as
similar
cost
that
is
on
an
individual
basis.
the
commission
should
have
known
that
its
findings
respecting
unit
costing
would
be
as
true
for
composite
and
area
costing
as
it
had
been
for
individual
costing.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
now
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
don't
think
anybody
could
put
their
finger
on
a
point
in
time
when
directionality
became
a
matter
of
significant
change
in
the
industry.
actually,
a
directionality
is
only
the
consequence
of
the
amassing
of
drilling
history
so
that
the
--you
drill
enough
wells
in
one
area
and
get
the
certain
product
as
result
of
that
drilling.you
know
that
if
you
go
to
drill
in
that
area,
you're
going
to
find
either
oil
or
gas
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
and
it
just
cumulates
it.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
cannot.
i
know
that
the
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
national
result
is
the
reverse
of
the
permian
basin
result
but
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
doubt
if
gas-well
gas
on
a
national
basis
ever
exceeded,
i
mean
that
they're
all
oil
gas
on
a
national
basis
ever
exceeded
gas-well
gas.
i
believe
there's
always
been
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
that's
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
that
is
so
mr.
justice
fortas,
then
it
not
be
consequence
of
the
predominance
of
gas-well
gas.
it
may
have
some
variant
on
the
fact
that
the
industry
alleged
for
the
first
time
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
proceeding
that
it
posses
these
directionality.
but
it
really
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
really
shouldn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
regulatory
method
insofar
as
the
use
or
not
--
non-use
of
cost.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
in
this
sense
of
the
word
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
does,
because
the
commission
after
they
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
was
directionality
in
the
industries
they
were
--
then
we
will
endeavor
to
cost
gas-well
gas
only
leaving
out
of
the
cost
data
and
the
cost
mass,
the
figures
relating
to
oil
well
gas.
and
therefore,
we
will
limit
the
allocation
product.
but
to
keep
it
in
focus,
the
allocation
column
still
goes
to
55%
of
the
cost
even
under
the
current
cost
of
gas-well
gas.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
think
not
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
don't
believe
the
other
side
mr.
chief
justice
warren
quite
said
that.
i
think
that
they
said
that
the
industry
showed
an
ability
to
search
directionally
at
a
point
in
time,
which
was
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
hearing.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
said
that
the
importance
of
gas-well
gas
as
compared
to
all
of
the
gas
that
there
was
any
shift
in
that
at
any
point
in
time.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
case.
the
commission
went
from
out
--
not
at
rejection
of
cost
to
service
as
a
producer
regulatory
method
to
have
a
permission
to
adduce
cost
of
service
evidence
on
a
group
basis
to
predicate
in
this
decision
entirely
upon
unit
cost
estimations.
and
this
was
done
in
the
phase
of
the
fact
that
composite
costing
surface
from
all
of
the
deficiencies
of
individual
costing
has
all
the
same
opportunities
to
arrive
at
any
desired
result.
but
even
worse,
suffers
from
the
additional
deficiencies
of
inadequate
and
inconsistent
data
and
data
sources.
this
course
of
action
was
also
taken
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
admitted
in
its
opinion
that
two-thirds
of
the
permian
basin
gas,
the
gas
produced
from
oil
well
could
not
be
--
i
mean,
if
they
cost
even
on
a
composite
basis.
mr.
justice
jackson,
with
rare
foresight,
foretold
the
dilemma
which
must
result
in
an
effort
to
regulate
the
producing
industry
as
a
public
utility.
in
fpc
versus
hope,
320
u.s.
591,
he
--
it
was
perceived,
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
utility
business
of
providing
an
inexhaustible
service
and
the
finding,
developing
and
producing
of
irreplaceable
gas
at
an
unknown
cost.
the
consequence
of
the
relationship
between
inputs
and
outputs,
sole
characteristic
in
the
utilities
and
so
absent
in
the
producing
industry
was
clear
to
him.
he
said
the
service
was
to
be
measured
by
what
was
got
out
of
the
ground
not
by
what
was
put
in
the
ground
and
that
there
was
no
more
relation
between
investment
and
result
in
a
game
of
poker.
he
thought
it
easier
to
directly
determine
the
fair
market
value
of
gas
than
to
indulge
in
a
round
about
way
of
rate
based
price
fixing.
a
year
later,
in
colorado
interstate
versus
fpc,
324
u.s.
581,
mr.
justice
jackson
was
in
even
more
prophetic.
there
he
indicated
he
had
not
buy
the
end
result
test
as
to
catch
all
solution
to
all
problems
nor
the
necessary
correlative
velocity
that
they
--
and
justifies
the
means.
this
was
especially
true
where
as
in
the
rate
of
--
natural
gas
rate
making
the
use
of
rate
based
figures
was
a
little
better
than
to
draw
figures
from
a
hat.
he
bemoaned
his
lack
of
intuitive
knowledge
by
which
he
may
determine
--
may
decide
that
a
rate
so
determined
was
just
and
reasonable.
in
that
case,
he
laid
down
the
foundation
of
what
became
the
regulatory
method
advocated
by
the
producers.
he
said
and
i
quote,
‚Äúforesight
of
gas
rate
regulation
will
concern
itself
for
the
present
and
future
rather
than
with
the
past
as
the
rate
base
formula
does.‚Äù
it
will
take
account
of
conditions
and
trends
at
the
source
of
the
supply
being
regulated.
it
was
used
price
as
a
tool
to
bring
goods
to
market,
to
obtain
for
the
public
service
that
needed
amount
of
gas.
once
the
price
is
reached,
that
will
do
that.
there
is
no
legal
or
economic
reason
to
go
higher.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
supply
is
not
too
(inaudible)
and
the
price
is
not
a
sufficient
incentive
to
exploit
it
and
fails
to
bring
forth
the
quality
needed,
the
price
is
unwisely
low
even
if
it
does
square
perfectly
with
somebody's
idea
of
return
on
a
rate
base.
before
going
into
the
supply
consequences
of
the
present
regulatory
method,
i
will
quickly
enumerate
the
reasons
why
rate
based
regulation
they
produced
in
the
industry
is
arbitrary,
discriminatory
and
unlawful.
one,
the
cost
of
gas
as
distinguished
from
the
cost
of
the
utility
service
cannot
be
determined.
two,
a
rate
fixed
at
any
estimated
cost
can
perform
the
economic
function
of
a
listening
supply
only
as
the
consequence
of
accident,
such
there's
no
relationship
between
cost
incurred
and
supply
added.
three,
if
a
cost
determined
interstate
rate
is
less
than
or
equal
to
a
free
market
determined
in
cost
state
rate
available
gas
supply
will
tend
to
move
to
the
intrastate
market.
four,
cost
based
rates
are
not
amenable
to
the
judicial
review
to
its
participants
in
a
producer
area
rate
proceeding
are
entitled.
the
tenth
circuit
said
and
i
quote,
‚Äúin
arriving
at
the
permian
basin
rates,
the
commission
used
many
sources
of
cost
information
that
producers
attacked
these
sources
on
many
invalid
grounds
to
take
up
each
of
these
objections
would
increase
the
rate
of
this
opinion
to
encyclopedic
dimensions.
from
the
information
so
obtained,
the
parties,
the
staff,
and
the
commission
made
many
competitions
and
reached
many
results.
the
assumptions,
allocations,
formula,
equations,
averages,
means,
and
massive
calculations
they
intrigue
a
mathematician
or
a
statistician
but
they
have
no
attraction
for
us.
we
respectfully
declined
to
be
drawn
into
such
a
turmoil
of
numbers.
we
cannot
in
a
few
months
unravel
as
null
of
statistics
developed
in
the
years
of
hearings.‚Äù
a
regulatory
method
which
is
too
massive
and
too
complicated
to
permit
appellate
review
can
hardly
be
deemed
a
valid
method.
and
the
end
result
test
fails
because
the
only
thing
against
which
the
end
result
may
be
tested
is
the
untested
cost
result.
five,
cost
to
service
discourages
exploration
because
it
uses
past
calls
to
set
future
rates
without
any
adjustment
contemplation.
sixth,
in
periods
of
declining
explorations
such
as
over
the
past
10
years,
successive
cost
to
service
studies
will
use
successively
lower
cost
results
which
in
turn
will
inspire
further
reduced
exploratory
expend
--
investment.
while
each
of
these
studies
well
appeared
to
provide
the
industry
with
the
return,
it
is
in
fact
liquidating
in
the
day
of
gas
shortage
and
gas
ration
and
is
being
advanced.
seven,
cost
to
service
estimated
area
by
area
will
discriminate
against
those
consumers
who
draw
their
supplies
from
high
cost
areas
and
discriminate
in
favor
of
those
consumers
withdraw
their
supplies
from
low
cost
areas.
eight,
the
cost
of
gas
has
no
relation
to
the
commodity
value
of
gas.
to
those
members
of
the
court
who
may
have
a
copy
of
my
brief

direct
your

where
all
appears
a
most
illuminating
table.
this
table
plainly
tells
us
that
under
the
empathies
of
commission
regulation,
we
are
slowly
running
out
of
gas.
however
high,
the
commission
is
to
be
graded,
for
providing
the
consumer
with
low
rates
for
gas,
it
is
lacking
in
providing
the
consumer
with
an
adequate
continuing
supply
of
gas.

i
wish
i
could
tell
this
court
at

would
reverse
this
trends
but
i
cannot.
in
1967,
successful
exploratory
well
is
drilled,
will
be
down
to
only
445
if
the
percentage
decline
for
the
first
nine
months
of
1967
compared
to
the
first
nine
months
of
1966
continues.
actual
demand
will
be
up
to
18.4
trillion
cubic
feet.
the
reserve
to
production
ratio
will
be
down
to
only
15.7
to
1.
this
is
practically
down
to
the
15.5
to
1
which
was
the
lowest
figure
that
any
party
to
these
proceedings
ever
suggested
it
was
safe
to
allow.
if
these
trends
are
not
reversed
or
rested,
it
is
frightening
to
ponder
what
the
supply-demand
relationship
to
future
prospects
will
be
by
1970,
only
three
years
away.
these
are
the
economic
forces
that
are
working
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
oil
industry,
it
has
run
generally
by
12
to
13
to
1.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
and
cost
that
way
for
decades
mr.
justice
stewart.
these
--
the
economic
forces
that
worked
in
the
industry,
they
are
plain
to
see,
they
are
easily
evaluated
at
any
point
in
time
and
they
cannot
be
ignored
in
the
process
of
ratemaking.
the
commission's
dual
price
rate
design
is
demonstrably
wrong
and
unlawful
in
several
respects.
one,
the
dual
price
system
itself
does
not
provide
incentive
as
claimed
by
the
commission.
a
single
high
enough
price
will
provide
incentive.
and
incentive
will
not
be
supplied
by
prices
which
are
too
low
no
matter
how
many
price
differentials
are
provided
according
to
dates
of
commitment
to
the
interstate
market.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
up
to
the
regulatory
agent
to
provide
the
regulatory
system
and
the
rate
structure
over
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
that
in
the
file
analysis
is
up
to
the
court
could
give
the
commission
guidance
whether
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
commission
has
come
up
with
a
system
that
is
unworkable
or
arbitrary
discriminatory.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
natural
gas
act
at
various
cases
have
held
that
the
commission
has
a
dual
function.
one
is
to
provide
adequate
supply
of
gas
to
the
consumer.
and
two,
is
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
at
which
that
first
former
function
can
be
performed.
and
i
think
that
the
judiciary
has
the
ultimate
duty
to
see
that
the
commission
is
performing
the
--
its
given
function.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
put
my
finger
or
anything
in
the
natural
gas
act
nor
the
legislative
history
which
specifically
directs
its
intention
to
that.
however,
there
are
numerous
recitations
in
the
commission
opinions
and
court
opinions
that
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
induce
an
adequate
supply
to
the
interstate
consumer
as
well
as
to
regulate
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
--
of
the
first
function
that
can
be
performed
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
they
have
acknowledged
it
as
being
their
duty
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
my
argument
is
that
they're
failing
and
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
said
that
the
commission
has
acknowledged
that
duty
and
it
is
argument
that
they
are
failing
in
that
acknowledged
duty.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
my
argument
depends
upon
the
existence
of
that
duty
justice
harlan.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well,
my
argument
mr.
justice
harlan
is
the
function
of
this
court
is
to
direct
the
commission
that
unit
cost
estimations
are
an
improper
and
unworkable
method
of
accomplishing
these
objectives
and
that
sincere
and
considered
evaluation
of
the
economic
characteristics
of
the
industry
are
necessary
and
obedient
to
whatever
method
they
do
evolve.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
then
i
think
this
--
i
think
really
it
would
be
on
the
same
posture
as
it
is
now.
i
don't
believe
it
was
necessary
before
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
that
is
right
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
no.
i
will
not
challenge
the
constitutional
power
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
absolutely
yes.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
is
so
only
if
you
accept
their
computed
cost
study
which
of
course
i
do
not
accept.
they
have
a
cost
of
service
computation
at
which
they
claim
that
a
portion
of
the
exploratory
cost
component
is
an
inducement
to
explore
but
i
don't
agree
with
that
or
accept
that
at
all.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
didn't
intend
to
give
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
did
not
address
myself
to
the
question
of
incentive
in
connection
with
the
evaluation
of
their
costing
studies
at
all
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
am
a
little
bit
in
a
lost
--
what
(inaudible),
i
must
have
misled
you
in
some
respect.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
that
is
correct.
i
further
say
that
is
impossible
to
be
correct
and
do
it
on
a
cost
basis.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
the
law
requires
that
they
consider
the
public
interest
in
setting
a
rate,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
they
must
buy
the
nature
of
the
--
definition
of
public
interest
consider
conservation
in
determining
their
rate
they
didn't
do
so.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
it
(inaudible)
very
well.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
considering
the
conservation
question
of
casinghead
gas
alone.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
mr.
justices,
if
it
please
the
court.
i'm
arguing
for
continental
oil
company
and
midhurst
oil
corporation.
of
the
many
extremely
important
issues
raised
in
the
permian
basin
area
rate
cases
my
argument
is
restricted
to
three
issues
which
i
believe
to
be
the
very
foundation
of
these
cases.
these
three
issues
go
to
the
theory
and
method
of
produced
regulation.
my
argument
accepts
the
legality
of
producer
regulation
on
an
area
and
a
group
basis
provided
such
regulation
is
not
arbitrary,
discriminatory
or
capricious
that
producer
petitioners
that
will
follow
me
in
argument
and
the
producers
who
are
respondents
only,
who
would
follow
them
addressed
themselves
to
different
issues.
a
conscientious
effort
has
been
made
to
ensure
that
no
issue
will
be
argued
by
more
than
one
producer
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
not
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
historically,
the
commission
had
determined
rates
on
utility
rate
base,
cost
to
service
method.
inherent
in
this
method
is
a
clear
foreseeable
relationship
as
to
any
particular
service
to
be
rendered
for
each
utility
entity
and
the
cost
of
rendering
that
service.
a
certain
number
of
dollars
will
provide
a
service
for
which
a
certain
rate
must
be
permitted.
this
is
the
heart
of
utility
regulation
and
this
system
has
worked
very
well
in
the
utility
industries.
when
this
court
held
that
the
natural
gas
act
applied
to
the
producers
of
natural
gas,
spokesman
for
this
industry
vehemently
urged
that
this
industry
was
no
count
whatever
to
a
public
utility
and
that
a
utility
method
of
regulation
could
not
successfully
be
applied
in
the
producing
industry.
the
commission
staff
urged
rejection
of
this
pleads.
after
all,
it
was
expert
in
utility
regulation
that
knew
they
were
they
method.
this
ideological
battle
weighs
for
seven
years
while
the
producers
thought
cost
to
service
regulation
and
urged
the
method
of
regulation
based
upon
the
consideration
of
the
economic
characteristics
of
and
the
economic
factors
that
work
in
the
producing
industry.
producers
argued
first
that
the
cost
of
gas
cannot
be
determined
like
the
cost
of
public
utility
service
with
little
joint
cause
but
for
gas
in
a
joint
product
with
oil
and
with
natural
gas
liquids
the
best
that
could
be
done
was
to
estimate
the
cost
of
gas
using
some
cost
in
formula
in
flowing
wholly
arbitrary
allocation
method
that
allocates
the
joint
cause.
in
no
real
sense
could
the
cost
of
gas
actually
be
determined.
the
producers
argued
second
that
the
commission
owed
a
duty
to
induce
an
adequate
continuing
supply
of
gas
for
the
interstate
consumer
and
that
even
if
the
cost
of
gas
could
be
determined,
a
cost
determined
rate
could
not
perform
the
function
of
a
listening
supply
due
to
the
lack
of
relationship
between
expenditures
and
results.
the
forcibility,
the
dollars
of
input,
the
output
and
the
rate
that
would
provide
an
adequate
return
so
characteristic
in
the
utilities
was
absent
in
the
producer
industry.
nonetheless,
during
these
seven
years,
the
utility
rate
based
cost
of
service
method
was
employed
by
the
commission
while
each
side
shamelessly
computed
cost
to
service
studies
designed
to
yield
a
desired
cost
result.
it
was
readily
apparent
that
the
joint
cost
constituted
such
a
large
percentage
of
the
total
cost
that
any
desired
cost
result
could
be
obtained
and
was
obtained.
finally,
the
commission
recognized
what
foolishness
this
was.
concurrently
with
the
second
phillips
opinion,
the
commission
issued
a
statement
of
general
policy
in
which
it
announced
it
was
abandoning
individual
regulation
in
favor
of
regulation
of
an
area
and
a
group
basis.
for
as
reasons
stated
in
the
second
phillips
that
in
the
experience
of
the
commission
and
i've
hoped
has
shown
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
traditional
original
cost,
prudent
investment
rate
base
method
of
regulating
utilities
is
not
a
sensible
or
even
a
workable
method
of
fixing
the
rates
of
independent
producers
of
natural
gas.
producers
of
natural
gas
cannot
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
properly
classified
as
traditional
public
utilities.
their
result
finally
reached
may
give
the
illusion
of
accuracy
since
mathematical
processes
are
involved
and
a
definite
prize
for
mcf
is
the
final
result.
but
such
a
result
must
be
tested
against
the
realities
of
the
marketplace.
thus,
prices
calculated
solely
on
the
cost
rate
base
principle
cannot
be
accepted
if
they
are
higher
than
a
buyer
pay
or
lower
than
the
seller
will
accept
when
an
unrealistic
result
is
reached,
they
formulate
for
allocations
must
be
changed
in
order
to
bring
about
a
reasonable
result.
the
allocation
method
has
then
become
a
means
of
supporting
a
result
already
arrived
at
rather
than
a
means
on
arriving
at
a
result
which
was
previously
unknown.
from
the
foregoing,
it
follows
that
effective
regulation
of
the
price
of
natural
gas
must
be
on
some
more
manageable
plan
than
the
rate
base
method.‚Äù

at

point

the

was

no,

is

338
of

mr.
bruce

and
--
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
that
case
came
here.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
and
that's
the
one
of
which
you
have
found
the
commission
and
its
filings
that
it
need
not
use
cost
of
services
in
its
regulation.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
that
was
the
forerunner
of
the
permian
basin
case
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
at
this
point
in
time,
the
commission
was
completely
correct
and
was
supported
in
such
findings
by
this
court
in
its
second
phillips
act
opinion.
the
commission
found
that
true
in
an
order
ruling
on
evidence
to
be
considered
in
these
proceedings,
proscribing
cost
of
service
evidenced
on
either
individual
or
a
group
basis.
subsequently
however,
there
were
important
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
commission
and
more
than
a
year
after
the
first
ruling,
a
second
ruling
issued
in
which
cost
to
service
was
to
be
permitted
on
a
group
basis.
such
composite
studies
that
the
commission
found
may
not
suffer
from
the
same
deficiencies
as
similar
cost
that
is
on
an
individual
basis.
the
commission
should
have
known
that
its
findings
respecting
unit
costing
would
be
as
true
for
composite
and
area
costing
as
it
had
been
for
individual
costing.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
now
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
don't
think
anybody
could
put
their
finger
on
a
point
in
time
when
directionality
became
a
matter
of
significant
change
in
the
industry.
actually,
a
directionality
is
only
the
consequence
of
the
amassing
of
drilling
history
so
that
the
--you
drill
enough
wells
in
one
area
and
get
the
certain
product
as
result
of
that
drilling.you
know
that
if
you
go
to
drill
in
that
area,
you're
going
to
find
either
oil
or
gas
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
and
it
just
cumulates
it.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
cannot.
i
know
that
the
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
national
result
is
the
reverse
of
the
permian
basin
result
but
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
doubt
if
gas-well
gas
on
a
national
basis
ever
exceeded,
i
mean
that
they're
all
oil
gas
on
a
national
basis
ever
exceeded
gas-well
gas.
i
believe
there's
always
been
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
that's
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
that
is
so
mr.
justice
fortas,
then
it
not
be
consequence
of
the
predominance
of
gas-well
gas.
it
may
have
some
variant
on
the
fact
that
the
industry
alleged
for
the
first
time
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
proceeding
that
it
posses
these
directionality.
but
it
really
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
really
shouldn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
regulatory
method
insofar
as
the
use
or
not
--
non-use
of
cost.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
in
this
sense
of
the
word
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
does,
because
the
commission
after
they
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
was
directionality
in
the
industries
they
were
--
then
we
will
endeavor
to
cost
gas-well
gas
only
leaving
out
of
the
cost
data
and
the
cost
mass,
the
figures
relating
to
oil
well
gas.
and
therefore,
we
will
limit
the
allocation
product.
but
to
keep
it
in
focus,
the
allocation
column
still
goes
to
55%
of
the
cost
even
under
the
current
cost
of
gas-well
gas.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
think
not
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
don't
believe
the
other
side
mr.
chief
justice
warren
quite
said
that.
i
think
that
they
said
that
the
industry
showed
an
ability
to
search
directionally
at
a
point
in
time,
which
was
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
hearing.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
said
that
the
importance
of
gas-well
gas
as
compared
to
all
of
the
gas
that
there
was
any
shift
in
that
at
any
point
in
time.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
case.
the
commission
went
from
out
--
not
at
rejection
of
cost
to
service
as
a
producer
regulatory
method
to
have
a
permission
to
adduce
cost
of
service
evidence
on
a
group
basis
to
predicate
in
this
decision
entirely
upon
unit
cost
estimations.
and
this
was
done
in
the
phase
of
the
fact
that
composite
costing
surface
from
all
of
the
deficiencies
of
individual
costing
has
all
the
same
opportunities
to
arrive
at
any
desired
result.
but
even
worse,
suffers
from
the
additional
deficiencies
of
inadequate
and
inconsistent
data
and
data
sources.
this
course
of
action
was
also
taken
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
admitted
in
its
opinion
that
two-thirds
of
the
permian
basin
gas,
the
gas
produced
from
oil
well
could
not
be
--
i
mean,
if
they
cost
even
on
a
composite
basis.
mr.
justice
jackson,
with
rare
foresight,
foretold
the
dilemma
which
must
result
in
an
effort
to
regulate
the
producing
industry
as
a
public
utility.
in
fpc
versus
hope,
320
u.s.
591,
he
--
it
was
perceived,
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
utility
business
of
providing
an
inexhaustible
service
and
the
finding,
developing
and
producing
of
irreplaceable
gas
at
an
unknown
cost.
the
consequence
of
the
relationship
between
inputs
and
outputs,
sole
characteristic
in
the
utilities
and
so
absent
in
the
producing
industry
was
clear
to
him.
he
said
the
service
was
to
be
measured
by
what
was
got
out
of
the
ground
not
by
what
was
put
in
the
ground
and
that
there
was
no
more
relation
between
investment
and
result
in
a
game
of
poker.
he
thought
it
easier
to
directly
determine
the
fair
market
value
of
gas
than
to
indulge
in
a
round
about
way
of
rate
based
price
fixing.
a
year
later,
in
colorado
interstate
versus
fpc,
324
u.s.
581,
mr.
justice
jackson
was
in
even
more
prophetic.
there
he
indicated
he
had
not
buy
the
end
result
test
as
to
catch
all
solution
to
all
problems
nor
the
necessary
correlative
velocity
that
they
--
and
justifies
the
means.
this
was
especially
true
where
as
in
the
rate
of
--
natural
gas
rate
making
the
use
of
rate
based
figures
was
a
little
better
than
to
draw
figures
from
a
hat.
he
bemoaned
his
lack
of
intuitive
knowledge
by
which
he
may
determine
--
may
decide
that
a
rate
so
determined
was
just
and
reasonable.
in
that
case,
he
laid
down
the
foundation
of
what
became
the
regulatory
method
advocated
by
the
producers.
he
said
and
i
quote,
‚Äúforesight
of
gas
rate
regulation
will
concern
itself
for
the
present
and
future
rather
than
with
the
past
as
the
rate
base
formula
does.‚Äù
it
will
take
account
of
conditions
and
trends
at
the
source
of
the
supply
being
regulated.
it
was
used
price
as
a
tool
to
bring
goods
to
market,
to
obtain
for
the
public
service
that
needed
amount
of
gas.
once
the
price
is
reached,
that
will
do
that.
there
is
no
legal
or
economic
reason
to
go
higher.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
supply
is
not
too
(inaudible)
and
the
price
is
not
a
sufficient
incentive
to
exploit
it
and
fails
to
bring
forth
the
quality
needed,
the
price
is
unwisely
low
even
if
it
does
square
perfectly
with
somebody's
idea
of
return
on
a
rate
base.
before
going
into
the
supply
consequences
of
the
present
regulatory
method,
i
will
quickly
enumerate
the
reasons
why
rate
based
regulation
they
produced
in
the
industry
is
arbitrary,
discriminatory
and
unlawful.
one,
the
cost
of
gas
as
distinguished
from
the
cost
of
the
utility
service
cannot
be
determined.
two,
a
rate
fixed
at
any
estimated
cost
can
perform
the
economic
function
of
a
listening
supply
only
as
the
consequence
of
accident,
such
there's
no
relationship
between
cost
incurred
and
supply
added.
three,
if
a
cost
determined
interstate
rate
is
less
than
or
equal
to
a
free
market
determined
in
cost
state
rate
available
gas
supply
will
tend
to
move
to
the
intrastate
market.
four,
cost
based
rates
are
not
amenable
to
the
judicial
review
to
its
participants
in
a
producer
area
rate
proceeding
are
entitled.
the
tenth
circuit
said
and
i
quote,
‚Äúin
arriving
at
the
permian
basin
rates,
the
commission
used
many
sources
of
cost
information
that
producers
attacked
these
sources
on
many
invalid
grounds
to
take
up
each
of
these
objections
would
increase
the
rate
of
this
opinion
to
encyclopedic
dimensions.
from
the
information
so
obtained,
the
parties,
the
staff,
and
the
commission
made
many
competitions
and
reached
many
results.
the
assumptions,
allocations,
formula,
equations,
averages,
means,
and
massive
calculations
they
intrigue
a
mathematician
or
a
statistician
but
they
have
no
attraction
for
us.
we
respectfully
declined
to
be
drawn
into
such
a
turmoil
of
numbers.
we
cannot
in
a
few
months
unravel
as
null
of
statistics
developed
in
the
years
of
hearings.‚Äù
a
regulatory
method
which
is
too
massive
and
too
complicated
to
permit
appellate
review
can
hardly
be
deemed
a
valid
method.
and
the
end
result
test
fails
because
the
only
thing
against
which
the
end
result
may
be
tested
is
the
untested
cost
result.
five,
cost
to
service
discourages
exploration
because
it
uses
past
calls
to
set
future
rates
without
any
adjustment
contemplation.
sixth,
in
periods
of
declining
explorations
such
as
over
the
past
10
years,
successive
cost
to
service
studies
will
use
successively
lower
cost
results
which
in
turn
will
inspire
further
reduced
exploratory
expend
--
investment.
while
each
of
these
studies
well
appeared
to
provide
the
industry
with
the
return,
it
is
in
fact
liquidating
in
the
day
of
gas
shortage
and
gas
ration
and
is
being
advanced.
seven,
cost
to
service
estimated
area
by
area
will
discriminate
against
those
consumers
who
draw
their
supplies
from
high
cost
areas
and
discriminate
in
favor
of
those
consumers
withdraw
their
supplies
from
low
cost
areas.
eight,
the
cost
of
gas
has
no
relation
to
the
commodity
value
of
gas.
to
those
members
of
the
court
who
may
have
a
copy
of
my
brief
before
them,
i
respectfully
direct
your
attention
to
page
29
where
all
appears
a
most
illuminating
table.
this
table
plainly
tells
us
that
under
the
empathies
of
commission
regulation,
we
are
slowly
running
out
of
gas.
however
high,
the
commission
is
to
be
graded,
for
providing
the
consumer
with
low
rates
for
gas,
it
is
lacking
in
providing
the
consumer
with
an
adequate
continuing
supply
of
gas.
column
b
shows
the
plunge
in
successful
exploratory
drilling
for
the
years
1960
to
1966
from
868
in
the
former
years
steadily
down
to
578
in
the
latter
year.
while
in
absolute
figures,
the
total
reserves
in
column
c
show
us
nine
increase,
increase
is
nowhere
near
as
great
as
to
increase
in
actual
demand
showing
in
column
e
with
the
attendant
continuous
decline
in
the
proportion
of
reserves
to
production
so
in
column
g.
i
wish
i
could
tell
this
court
at
1967
would
reverse
this
trends
but
i
cannot.
in
1967,
successful
exploratory
well
is
drilled,
will
be
down
to
only
445
if
the
percentage
decline
for
the
first
nine
months
of
1967
compared
to
the
first
nine
months
of
1966
continues.
actual
demand
will
be
up
to
18.4
trillion
cubic
feet.
the
reserve
to
production
ratio
will
be
down
to
only
15.7
to
1.
this
is
practically
down
to
the
15.5
to
1
which
was
the
lowest
figure
that
any
party
to
these
proceedings
ever
suggested
it
was
safe
to
allow.
if
these
trends
are
not
reversed
or
rested,
it
is
frightening
to
ponder
what
the
supply-demand
relationship
to
future
prospects
will
be
by
1970,
only
three
years
away.
these
are
the
economic
forces
that
are
working
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
oil
industry,
it
has
run
generally
by
12
to
13
to
1.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
and
cost
that
way
for
decades
mr.
justice
stewart.
these
--
the
economic
forces
that
worked
in
the
industry,
they
are
plain
to
see,
they
are
easily
evaluated
at
any
point
in
time
and
they
cannot
be
ignored
in
the
process
of
ratemaking.
the
commission's
dual
price
rate
design
is
demonstrably
wrong
and
unlawful
in
several
respects.
one,
the
dual
price
system
itself
does
not
provide
incentive
as
claimed
by
the
commission.
a
single
high
enough
price
will
provide
incentive.
and
incentive
will
not
be
supplied
by
prices
which
are
too
low
no
matter
how
many
price
differentials
are
provided
according
to
dates
of
commitment
to
the
interstate
market.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
up
to
the
regulatory
agent
to
provide
the
regulatory
system
and
the
rate
structure
over
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
that
in
the
file
analysis
is
up
to
the
court
could
give
the
commission
guidance
whether
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
commission
has
come
up
with
a
system
that
is
unworkable
or
arbitrary
discriminatory.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
natural
gas
act
at
various
cases
have
held
that
the
commission
has
a
dual
function.
one
is
to
provide
adequate
supply
of
gas
to
the
consumer.
and
two,
is
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
at
which
that
first
former
function
can
be
performed.
and
i
think
that
the
judiciary
has
the
ultimate
duty
to
see
that
the
commission
is
performing
the
--
its
given
function.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
put
my
finger
or
anything
in
the
natural
gas
act
nor
the
legislative
history
which
specifically
directs
its
intention
to
that.
however,
there
are
numerous
recitations
in
the
commission
opinions
and
court
opinions
that
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
induce
an
adequate
supply
to
the
interstate
consumer
as
well
as
to
regulate
the
rates
that
were
in
effect
--
of
the
first
function
that
can
be
performed
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
they
have
acknowledged
it
as
being
their
duty
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
my
argument
is
that
they're
failing
and
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
said
that
the
commission
has
acknowledged
that
duty
and
it
is
argument
that
they
are
failing
in
that
acknowledged
duty.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
my
argument
depends
upon
the
existence
of
that
duty
justice
harlan.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well,
my
argument
mr.
justice
harlan
is
the
function
of
this
court
is
to
direct
the
commission
that
unit
cost
estimations
are
an
improper
and
unworkable
method
of
accomplishing
these
objectives
and
that
sincere
and
considered
evaluation
of
the
economic
characteristics
of
the
industry
are
necessary
and
obedient
to
whatever
method
they
do
evolve.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
then
i
think
this
--
i
think
really
it
would
be
on
the
same
posture
as
it
is
now.
i
don't
believe
it
was
necessary
before
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
that
is
right
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
no.
i
will
not
challenge
the
constitutional
power
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
absolutely
yes.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
is
so
only
if
you
accept
their
computed
cost
study
which
of
course
i
do
not
accept.
they
have
a
cost
of
service
computation
at
which
they
claim
that
a
portion
of
the
exploratory
cost
component
is
an
inducement
to
explore
but
i
don't
agree
with
that
or
accept
that
at
all.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
didn't
intend
to
give
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
did
not
address
myself
to
the
question
of
incentive
in
connection
with
the
evaluation
of
their
costing
studies
at
all
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
am
a
little
bit
in
a
lost
--
what
(inaudible),
i
must
have
misled
you
in
some
respect.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
that
is
correct.
i
further
say
that
is
impossible
to
be
correct
and
do
it
on
a
cost
basis.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
the
law
requires
that
they
consider
the
public
interest
in
setting
a
rate,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
they
must
buy
the
nature
of
the
--
definition
of
public
interest
consider
conservation
in
determining
their
rate
they
didn't
do
so.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
it
(inaudible)
very
well.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
considering
the
conservation
question
of
casinghead

alone.
