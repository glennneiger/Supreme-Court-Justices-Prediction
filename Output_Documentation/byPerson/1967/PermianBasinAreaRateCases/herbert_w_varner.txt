mr.
herbert
w.
varner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
herbert
varner
and
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
superior
oil
company.
the
superior
oil
company
is
a
large
nonintegrated
producer
of
oil
and
gas.
we
have
no
refining
operations,
no
retail
marketing
of
any
kind.
we
do
not
engage
in
the
federal
chemical
business,
on
the
plastics
business,
(inaudible).
our
operations
are
limited
exclusively
to
exploring
far
and
producing
that
oil
and
gas
which
is
sold
generally
in
the
(inaudible).
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
our
operations,
relatively
more
allow
a
capital
is
expanded
annually
for
exploration,
than
that
of
most
other
companies.
more
than
that
perhaps
in
the
integrated
company,
because
necessarily
their
budgets
must
include
their
exploration
function
and
accommodate
to
the
other
aspects
of
their
business
which
are
vary
in
their
needs
from
year
to
year,
more
than
the
so-called
small
producers,
merely
because
of
our
size.
our
operations
are
identical
with
that
of
the
so-called
small
producer.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
need
to
drill
more
wells
and
deep
wells,
we
are
what
is
known
as
a
high
cost
company.
we
do
not
gold
plate
our
wells.
dr.
warren
(ph),
a
witness
for
the
commission,
explained
in
--
explaining
why
there
was
a
variation
in
annual
cost
of
the
various
companies
for
drilling
and
exploration,
that
primarily
it
results
from
what
he
call
the
well
mix,
the
well
mix
being
the
type
of
well
and
the
depth
of
well.
and
he
said
these
are
the
factors
that
lead
to
add
cost,
not
extractions,
not
improvements.
he
did
point
out
that
there
was
a
great
range
in
cost
from
here
to
here
between
the
various
companies.
but
he
did
not
point
out
and
it
is
not
true,
that
a
high
cost
operator
who
continues
to
do
the
same
thing
won't
continue
doing
a
high
cost
operation.
it's
just
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
business.
as
i
say,
there
are
some
changes
in
some
of
the
companies.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
even
though
they
don't
get
their
money
back
this
year,
next
year
they're
the
low
cost
companies
can
get
it.
that
argument
to
me
runs
right
into
the
phase
of
regulatory
rules
that
future
rates
will
not
be
made
to
compensate
the
past
losses.
now
i
would
assume
that
present
rates
will
not
be
fixed
to
compensate
for
potential
savings
which
may
or
may
not
ever
develop.
but
this
fact
explains
why
superior
takes
the
position
that
we
do,
that
group
rate
fixing
is
invalid.
the
fact
is
that
high
cost
companies
get
the
benefit
of
the
reduced
rate
that
results
from
average
whereas
the
low
cost
companies
get
a
part
of
their
cost,
a
part
of
the
high
company
cost
which
go
into
their
averages
and
permit
the
computation
of
a
rate
of
return
for
them
on
figures
which
are
in
fact
actually
higher
than
their
cost.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
i
do
quite
differently
from
continental.
i
take
the
position
that
group
rate
fixing
under
the
natural
gas
act
is
not
provided
for
in
the
act.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
right.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
right.
i
may
give
you
an
exception
later
of
suggesting
method
if
you
want
it.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
i
did
not
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
in
part.
it
is
in
part,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
say
basically
so.
i
think
this,
if
i
must
put
myself
in
a
nutshell,
i'd
say
my
position
is
that
the
hope
decision
is
correct.
now,
as
i
say
i
am
going
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
issue
of
legality.
and
the
basis
of
(inaudible)
is
that
the
natural
gas
itself
at
work,
requires
individual
rate
fixing.
furthermore
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
act
as
this
court
has
described
it,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
case,
the
hope
case
and
the
colorado
interstate
case,
i
think
leads
a
no
conclusion
other
than
that
individual
rate
fixing
is
absolutely
required.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
show
that
if
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
provide
for
the
establishment
of
individual
just
and
reasonable
rate,
then
the
act
doesn't
have
any
standard
of
regulation
whatsoever.
it
is
with
that
question
then,
i
believe,
an
unlawful,
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power.
because
then,
they
are
legislating
rates
and
they
have
no
standard
whatsoever.
now
the
act
was
passed
in
1938,
and
as
the
court
below
found,
all
of
its
wording
goes
to
the
(inaudible).
now,
the
general
counsel
for
the
commission
told
you
a
particular
attention
to
section
4
and
i'd
like
to
do
the
same
thing.
he
urged
going
here,
that
any
rate
has
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
i
will
look
at
the
same
section
because
it
says
all
rates
of
any
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable
and
if
they're
not,
they're
unlawful.
this
was
the
rate
standard
under
which
the
natural
gas
act
was
held
constitutional
in
natural
gas
pipe.
there,
with
reference
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
permitted
under
section
5,
the
court
said,
by
long
standing
usage
in
the
field
of
rate
regulation,
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
or
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
is
one
which
is
not
confiscatory
in
the
constitutional
sense.
the
constitutional
sense
itself
is
an
individual
consent.
it
applies
to
a
person
or
a
company.
now
i
admit
it
that
the
constitution
doesn't
find
rate
fixing
or
agencies
to
the
use
of
a
single
formula,
but
the
leeway
to
choose
a
formula
for
fixing
has
absolutely
nothing
with
meeting
the
standard
of
rate
fixing
which
again
is
just
and
reasonable.
now
this
was
the
precise
holding
as
i
understand
the
hope
natural
gas
case.
there,
they
said
that
at
the
end
result
is
just
and
reasonable.
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
how
they
got
that.
they
can
use
any
formula
they
choose.
and
they
said
to
be
just
and
reasonable
the
rate
must
be
one
that
will
produce
revenue
sufficient
to
cover
the
operating
cost
and
the
capital
cost
of
the
business.
it
must
be
rates
which
from
the
investor
or
a
company
point,
will
lead
capital
cost
the
ability
to
pay
interest
on
debt,
pay
dividends,
to
have
sufficient
return
to
measure
what
the
risk
in
several
enterprises
to
maintain
confidence
in
the
financial
integrity
of
the
business,
to
permit
that
business,
to
maintain
its
credit
and
attract
more
capital.
the
obtaining
and
maintaining
of
credit,
the
payment
of
dividends,
the
attraction
of
capital,
even
the
payment
of
operating
expenses
are
all
individual
company
obligations
and
abilities.
the
industry
does
not
have
these
capabilities,
it
does
not
have
these
obligations.
since
you
cannot
comply,
the
hope
case
to
the
industry
as
such,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
are
in
the
position
where
there
is
no
standard
whatsoever
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
there
cannot
be
any
question
as
to
the
fact
that
hope
did
in
fact
require
individualized
rate
fixing.
the
very
option
was
suggested
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson,
there
he
pointed
out
that
because
and
incidentally
these
are
the
same
reasons
now
put
forth
for
the
group
rate
method,
because
of
the
erratic
nature
and
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
this
business,
the
erratic
nature
between
investment
and
results.
that
it
was
improper
to
use
any
sort
of
cost
of
service.
incidentally,
i
do
not
insist
on
the
cost
of
service,
that
doesn't
have
to
be
the
method.
but
--
then
he
said
what
he
would
like
to
do,
is
to
fix
the
price
of
gas
on
some
sort
of
a
commodity,
a
basis
that
didn't
assure
a
fair
return
to
any
producer.
in
his
own
words,
his
views
were
rejected
by
the
majority
of
the
court
because
congress
in
passing
the
natural
gas
act
intended
to
and
did
provide
for
regulation
along
recognized
in
more
or
less
standardized
matter.
they
then
--
conceivable
to
me
that
the
individual
rate
fixing
requirement
opposed
in
1944
is
not
equally
applicable
today
even
though
it
may
be
inconvenient
with
the
administrative
agency.
certainly,
since
1938
when
this
act
was
passed,
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
intent
of
congress
has
changed.
furthermore,
it's
rather
unbelievable
to
me
that
a
rate
fixing
agency
would
propose
a
matter
which
by
design
is
going
to
provide
far
in
the
words
or
the
court
below
of
bankruptcy
rate
for
a
high
percentage
of
the
industry
and
less
than
a
fair
rate
for
50%
of
it.
this
is
the
exact
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
i
would
refer
you
to
the
cost
of
service
exhibit
of
the
superior
oil
company
which
was
offered
refused
of
course
because
there
was
a
preliminary
order
to
the
effect
that
individual
cost
would
not
be
considered
or
heard.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
i
would
also
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
it
--
i
won't
say
it
won't
cover
out-of-pocket
cost
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
you
have
placed
me
in
a
terrible
position
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
alright,
may
i
answer
it
this
way?
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
well,
you
asked
me
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
by
ordinary
accounting
methods.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
very
well,
let
me
explain.
you
asked
by
ordinary
accounting
methods,
ordinary
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
alright
sir.
by
the
methods
that
i
believe
were
used
here
on
a
composite
basis,
that
would
be
the
result.
i
would
give
you
an
example
that
is
in
the
record
of
some
variant
between
the
cost,
there
is
an
exhibit
here
put
in
by
the
staff
witness
wright.
it's
exhibit
number
174,
found
at
record
of
499e
and
500e.
and
it
shows
the
cost
for
raw
gas,
total
raw
gas
of
some
60
producers
in
the
permian
basin
which
includes
among
others
the
superior
oil
company.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
we're
both.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
everybody
in
the
industry
in
the
permian
basin
is
both
primarily
because
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
if
you
won't
rule
me
to
this,
i'd
say
we
do
not
have
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
in
all
probability
in
a
gas-well
gas.
i
believe
it's
all
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
associated
gas.
i
believe
that
happens
to
be
our
particular
situation.
if
you
look
at
that
exhibit
that
i've
pointed
to
you,
you'll
have
to
look
the
company
number
48
because
the
companies
are
not
named.
the
rate
there
shown
for
the
superior
oil
company
is
14.7.
you
will
observe
and
somebody
asked
this
question
yesterday
so
i'll
get
to
it
now.
that
somebody
asked
a
question,
what
is
the
variants
of
cost
between
the
companies?
the
com
--
the
variants
here,
and
this
is
not
total
cost,
but
this
is
a
cost
concept
that
mr.
wright
developed
on
this
particular
item
and
it
shows
there
it
ranged
from
4
cents
per
thousand
to
28.9
cent
per
thousand
for
all
except
the
last
company.
the
last
company,
the
60th
with
a
dollar
22,
so
that's
pretty
high.
now,
the
fact
is
that
if
you'd
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
no
sir,
it
doesn't
take
into
account
the
oil
revenue
and
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
oil
isn't
regulated,
but
we
have
made
allocations.
now
of
course
in
this
particular
case
they
did
not.
they
used
--
they
determined
cost
for
gas-well
gas
for
the
reason
that
they
said
there
are
fewer
allocations.
the
--
someone
has
pointed
out,
you
still
have
55%
of
the
total
cost
is
an
allocated
cost.
but
be
that
as
it
might
they
could
--
they
imputed
that
cost
over
to
the
associated
gas.
now
as
i
say,
this
ratemaking
method,
by
design
is
going
to
result
in
a
high
percentage
of
the
companies
going
out
of
business
or
being
required
to
go
out
of
business
every
time
there's
a
successive
hearing
because
obviously
if
the
high
cost
--
the
highest
cost
producers
here
are
eliminated,
the
next
time
you
got
a
low
rated
average
and
so
you
are
going
to
eliminate
those
and
pretty
soon
you're
going
to
get
down
to
where
there
are
no
others.
then
that
effect
of
it
--
it
seems
to
me
it's
totally
contrary
to
general
national
policy.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
without
the
--
no.
without
the
oil
production,
we
probably
would
not
have
produced
this
gas.
now
the
thing
is
this,
if
we
do
not
continue
to
produce
the
gas
as
general
witt
pointed
out,
we
can't
produce
the
oil
because
it
is
now
prohibited
to
flare
gas.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
prohibited
to
flare
gas
for
the
sole
production
of
--
sole
purpose
of
producing
oil
that
maybe
i
think
pointed
out
some
exceptional
circumstances
where
economics
will
not
permit
it.
now
unless
we
have
this
economics
imposed
on
us,
we've
been
able
to
--
forward
to
gather
it
and
sell
it.
now
i
would
point
out
too,
the
natural
gas
act
certainly
does
not
require
a
uniform.
a
uniform
price
is
alien
to
the
industry.
it
hasn't
even
been
a
matter
that
the
purchasers
have
embarked
upon
their
prices
in
the
same
field
at
the
same
time
are
generally
are
the
same.
but
between
purchasers,
there's
always
been
a
difference
in
price.
there
is
in
a
situation
here
that
have
been
pointed
to
where
they
say,
but
you
can't
make
money
anyhow.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we've
been
getting
along
very
well
at
our
contract
rates
and
the
contract
rates,
high,
low
or
otherwise
have
been
rates
that
the
public
not
only
could
afford
but
found
sufficiently
interesting
to
increase
their
demand
for
the
product.
i
certainly
can
assure
you
that
if
you
can
eliminate
any
high
percentage
of
the
50%
of
the
companies
who
will
not
make
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
in
their
gas
production,
there
is
an
absolute
shortage
tomorrow
if
that's
when
it
becomes
effective.
now,
i
would
also
call
to
you
--
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
justice
jackson's
dissent
in
hope,
he
recognized
that
in
this
situation
if
the
party
who's
rate
was
--
did
not
yield
a
fair
return,
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
business
and
was
compelled
by
some
other
reasons
to
stay
in,
then
the
court
--
he
was
suggesting
would
not
meet
constitutional
requirements
and
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here.
now,
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
moment
ago
was
that
there
can
be
absolutely
no
question
as
to
the
effect
of
the
holding
in
hope.
and
for
that,
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention,
the
decision
in
bowles
versus
willingham
which
involved
a
wartime
federal
rent
control
statute.
that
opinion
written
less
than
90
days
after
hope,
again,
by
mr.
justice
douglas
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
majority
of
the
court,
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
this
rent
control
line
and
the
natural
gas
act
because
congress
in
passing
the
natural
gas
act
provided
the
fixing
a
rates
which
are
just
and
reasonable
in
their
application
to
particular
companies
or
particular
parties
and
he
cited
hope
of
course
with
that
to
review.
now
then,
if
we
assume,
which
i
don't,
that
hope
is
not
governing
here
and
i
do
not
see
how
group
rate
fixing
can
be
established
without
overruling
hope.
and
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
second
phillips
did
that
because
second
phillips
relied
in
fact
on
hope.
second
phillips
says,
"first,
we're
not
going
to
render
advisory
opinions,
which
of
course
is
nothing
new
in
history
of
this
court,
and
they
didn't".
but
they
did
say
this,
they
said,
"we
can't
--
now
determine
that
the
method
employed
will
necessarily
result
in
a
rate
which
is
not
just
to
the
consumer
and
not
just
and
reasonable
to
the
producer,
a
rate
to
which
they
each
have
a
right".
that's
that
right
i
am
here
insisting
upon.
now,
if
the
act
doesn't
provide
for
group
rate
fixing
and
certainly
i
think
everybody
concedes
it
does
not
provide
for
it
and
the
question
is
does
it
prohibit?
then
if
it
doesn't,
then
by
what
standard
must
the
composition
of
groups
be
determined
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
act
provides
none.
now
obviously
if
the
federal
power
commission
can
pick
any
group
it
chooses,
then
by
the
very
constitution
of
the
group
itself
you
foreclose
and
foreordain
what
the
average
rate
will
be
and
what
appears
to
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
if
the
answer
of
it
that
--
well
it
doesn't
say
one
way
or
another
so
obviously
the
implication
is
that
they
may
create
reasonable
groups,
then
if
that'd
be
the
case
in
this
particular
proceeding
we
have
all
been
deprived
the
due
process
of
law
for
the
reason
of
that.
with
the
institution
of
the
proceeding
here,
the
commission
also
provided
in
the
very
same
law
that
they
would
not
entertain
objections
or
a
contention
to
the
effect
that
the
group
fixed
was
not
sufficient
for
rate
making
purposes.
and
we
have
been
deprived
of
that
and
therefore
as
i
say
we
have
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
herbert
varner
and
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
superior
oil
company.
the
superior
oil
company
is
a
large
nonintegrated
producer
of
oil
and
gas.
we
have
no
refining
operations,
no
retail
marketing
of
any
kind.
we
do
not
engage
in
the
federal
chemical
business,
on
the
plastics
business,
(inaudible).
our
operations
are
limited
exclusively
to
exploring
far
and
producing
that
oil
and
gas
which
is
sold
generally
in
the
(inaudible).
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
our
operations,
relatively
more
allow
a
capital
is
expanded
annually
for
exploration,
than
that
of
most
other
companies.
more
than
that
perhaps
in
the
integrated
company,
because
necessarily
their
budgets
must
include
their
exploration
function
and
accommodate
to
the
other
aspects
of
their
business
which
are
vary
in
their
needs
from
year
to
year,
more
than
the
so-called
small
producers,
merely
because
of
our
size.
our
operations
are
identical
with
that
of
the
so-called
small
producer.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
need
to
drill
more
wells
and
deep
wells,
we
are
what
is
known
as
a
high
cost
company.
we
do
not
gold
plate
our
wells.
dr.
warren
(ph),
a
witness
for
the
commission,
explained
in
--
explaining
why
there
was
a
variation
in
annual
cost
of
the
various
companies
for
drilling
and
exploration,
that
primarily
it
results
from
what
he
call
the
well
mix,
the
well
mix
being
the
type
of
well
and
the
depth
of
well.
and
he
said
these
are
the
factors
that
lead
to
add
cost,
not
extractions,
not
improvements.
he
did
point
out
that
there
was
a
great
range
in
cost
from
here
to
here
between
the
various
companies.
but
he
did
not
point
out
and
it
is
not
true,
that
a
high
cost
operator
who
continues
to
do
the
same
thing
won't
continue
doing
a
high
cost
operation.
it's
just
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
business.
as
i
say,
there
are
some
changes
in
some
of
the
companies.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
even
though
they
don't
get
their
money
back
this
year,
next
year
they're
the
low
cost
companies
can
get
it.
that
argument
to
me
runs
right
into
the
phase
of
regulatory
rules
that
future
rates
will
not
be
made
to
compensate
the
past
losses.
now
i
would
assume
that
present
rates
will
not
be
fixed
to
compensate
for
potential
savings
which
may
or
may
not
ever
develop.
but
this
fact
explains
why
superior
takes
the
position
that
we
do,
that
group
rate
fixing
is
invalid.
the
fact
is
that
high
cost
companies
get
the
benefit
of
the
reduced
rate
that
results
from
average
whereas
the
low
cost
companies
get
a
part
of
their
cost,
a
part
of
the
high
company
cost
which
go
into
their
averages
and
permit
the
computation
of
a
rate
of
return
for
them
on
figures
which
are
in
fact
actually
higher
than
their
cost.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
i
do
quite
differently
from
continental.
i
take
the
position
that
group
rate
fixing
under
the
natural
gas
act
is
not
provided
for
in
the
act.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
right.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
right.
i
may
give
you
an
exception
later
of
suggesting
method
if
you
want
it.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
i
did
not
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
in
part.
it
is
in
part,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
say
basically
so.
i
think
this,
if
i
must
put
myself
in
a
nutshell,
i'd
say
my
position
is
that
the
hope
decision
is
correct.
now,
as
i
say
i
am
going
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
issue
of
legality.
and
the
basis
of
(inaudible)
is
that
the
natural
gas
itself
at
work,
requires
individual
rate
fixing.
furthermore
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
act
as
this
court
has
described
it,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
case,
the
hope
case
and
the
colorado
interstate
case,
i
think
leads
a
no
conclusion
other
than
that
individual
rate
fixing
is
absolutely
required.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
show
that
if
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
provide
for
the
establishment
of
individual
just
and
reasonable
rate,
then
the
act
doesn't
have
any
standard
of
regulation
whatsoever.
it
is
with
that
question
then,
i
believe,
an
unlawful,
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power.
because
then,
they
are
legislating
rates
and
they
have
no
standard
whatsoever.
now
the
act
was
passed
in
1938,
and
as
the
court
below
found,
all
of
its
wording
goes
to
the
(inaudible).
now,
the
general
counsel
for
the
commission
told
you
a
particular
attention
to
section
4
and
i'd
like
to
do
the
same
thing.
he
urged
going
here,
that
any
rate
has
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
i
will
look
at
the
same
section
because
it
says
all
rates
of
any
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable
and
if
they're
not,
they're
unlawful.
this
was
the
rate
standard
under
which
the
natural
gas
act
was
held
constitutional
in
natural
gas
pipe.
there,
with
reference
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
permitted
under
section
5,
the
court
said,
by
long
standing
usage
in
the
field
of
rate
regulation,
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
or
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
is
one
which
is
not
confiscatory
in
the
constitutional
sense.
the
constitutional
sense
itself
is
an
individual
consent.
it
applies
to
a
person
or
a
company.
now
i
admit
it
that
the
constitution
doesn't
find
rate
fixing
or
agencies
to
the
use
of
a
single
formula,
but
the
leeway
to
choose
a
formula
for
fixing
has
absolutely
nothing
with
meeting
the
standard
of
rate
fixing
which
again
is
just
and
reasonable.
now
this
was
the
precise
holding
as
i
understand
the
hope
natural
gas
case.
there,
they
said
that
at
the
end
result
is
just
and
reasonable.
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
how
they
got
that.
they
can
use
any
formula
they
choose.
and
they
said
to
be
just
and
reasonable
the
rate
must
be
one
that
will
produce
revenue
sufficient
to
cover
the
operating
cost
and
the
capital
cost
of
the
business.
it
must
be
rates
which
from
the
investor
or
a
company
point,
will
lead
capital
cost
the
ability
to
pay
interest
on
debt,
pay
dividends,
to
have
sufficient
return
to
measure
what
the
risk
in
several
enterprises
to
maintain
confidence
in
the
financial
integrity
of
the
business,
to
permit
that
business,
to
maintain
its
credit
and
attract
more
capital.
the
obtaining
and
maintaining
of
credit,
the
payment
of
dividends,
the
attraction
of
capital,
even
the
payment
of
operating
expenses
are
all
individual
company
obligations
and
abilities.
the
industry
does
not
have
these
capabilities,
it
does
not
have
these
obligations.
since
you
cannot
comply,
the
hope
case
to
the
industry
as
such,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
are
in
the
position
where
there
is
no
standard
whatsoever
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
there
cannot
be
any
question
as
to
the
fact
that
hope
did
in
fact
require
individualized
rate
fixing.
the
very
option
was
suggested
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson,
there
he
pointed
out
that
because
and
incidentally
these
are
the
same
reasons
now
put
forth
for
the
group
rate
method,
because
of
the
erratic
nature
and
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
this
business,
the
erratic
nature
between
investment
and
results.
that
it
was
improper
to
use
any
sort
of
cost
of
service.
incidentally,
i
do
not
insist
on
the
cost
of
service,
that
doesn't
have
to
be
the
method.
but
--
then
he
said
what
he
would
like
to
do,
is
to
fix
the
price
of
gas
on
some
sort
of
a
commodity,
a
basis
that
didn't
assure
a
fair
return
to
any
producer.
in
his
own
words,
his
views
were
rejected
by
the
majority
of
the
court
because
congress
in
passing
the
natural
gas
act
intended
to
and
did
provide
for
regulation
along
recognized
in
more
or
less
standardized
matter.
they
then
--
conceivable
to
me
that
the
individual
rate
fixing
requirement
opposed
in
1944
is
not
equally
applicable
today
even
though
it
may
be
inconvenient
with
the
administrative
agency.
certainly,
since
1938
when
this
act
was
passed,
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
intent
of
congress
has
changed.
furthermore,
it's
rather
unbelievable
to
me
that
a
rate
fixing
agency
would
propose
a
matter
which
by
design
is
going
to
provide
far
in
the
words
or
the
court
below
of
bankruptcy
rate
for
a
high
percentage
of
the
industry
and
less
than
a
fair
rate
for
50%
of
it.
this
is
the
exact
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
i
would
refer
you
to
the
cost
of
service
exhibit
of
the
superior
oil
company
which
was
offered
refused
of
course
because
there
was
a
preliminary
order
to
the
effect
that
individual
cost
would
not
be
considered
or
heard.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes
sir.
i
would
also
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
it
--
i
won't
say
it
won't
cover
out-of-pocket
cost
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
you
have
placed
me
in
a
terrible
position
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
alright,
may
i
answer
it
this
way?
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
well,
you
asked
me
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
by
ordinary
accounting
methods.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
very
well,
let
me
explain.
you
asked
by
ordinary
accounting
methods,
ordinary
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
alright
sir.
by
the
methods
that
i
believe
were
used
here
on
a
composite
basis,
that
would
be
the
result.
i
would
give
you
an
example
that
is
in
the
record
of
some
variant
between
the
cost,
there
is
an
exhibit
here
put
in
by
the
staff
witness
wright.
it's
exhibit
number
174,
found
at
record
of
499e
and
500e.
and
it
shows
the
cost
for
raw
gas,
total
raw
gas
of
some
60
producers
in
the
permian
basin
which
includes
among
others
the
superior
oil
company.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
we're
both.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
everybody
in
the
industry
in
the
permian
basin
is
both
primarily
because
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
if
you
won't
rule
me
to
this,
i'd
say
we
do
not
have
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
in
all
probability
in
a
gas-well
gas.
i
believe
it's
all
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
--
associated
gas.
i
believe
that
happens
to
be
our
particular
situation.
if
you
look
at
that
exhibit
that
i've
pointed
to
you,
you'll
have
to
look
the
company
number
48
because
the
companies
are
not
named.
the
rate
there
shown
for
the
superior
oil
company
is
14.7.
you
will
observe
and
somebody
asked
this
question
yesterday
so
i'll
get
to
it
now.
that
somebody
asked
a
question,
what
is
the
variants
of
cost
between
the
companies?
the
com
--
the
variants
here,
and
this
is
not
total
cost,
but
this
is
a
cost
concept
that
mr.
wright
developed
on
this
particular
item
and
it
shows
there
it
ranged
from
4
cents
per
thousand
to
28.9
cent
per
thousand
for
all
except
the
last
company.
the
last
company,
the
60th
with
a
dollar
22,
so
that's
pretty
high.
now,
the
fact
is
that
if
you'd
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
no
sir,
it
doesn't
take
into
account
the
oil
revenue
and
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
oil
isn't
regulated,
but
we
have
made
allocations.
now
of
course
in
this
particular
case
they
did
not.
they
used
--
they
determined
cost
for
gas-well
gas
for
the
reason
that
they
said
there
are
fewer
allocations.
the
--
someone
has
pointed
out,
you
still
have
55%
of
the
total
cost
is
an
allocated
cost.
but
be
that
as
it
might
they
could
--
they
imputed
that
cost
over
to
the
associated
gas.
now
as
i
say,
this
ratemaking
method,
by
design
is
going
to
result
in
a
high
percentage
of
the
companies
going
out
of
business
or
being
required
to
go
out
of
business
every
time
there's
a
successive
hearing
because
obviously
if
the
high
cost
--
the
highest
cost
producers
here
are
eliminated,
the
next
time
you
got
a
low
rated
average
and
so
you
are
going
to
eliminate
those
and
pretty
soon
you're
going
to
get
down
to
where
there
are
no
others.
then
that
effect
of
it
--
it
seems
to
me
it's
totally
contrary
to
general
national
policy.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
without
the
--
no.
without
the
oil
production,
we
probably
would
not
have
produced
this
gas.
now
the
thing
is
this,
if
we
do
not
continue
to
produce
the
gas
as
general
witt
pointed
out,
we
can't
produce
the
oil
because
it
is
now
prohibited
to
flare
gas.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
prohibited
to
flare
gas
for
the
sole
production
of
--
sole
purpose
of
producing
oil
that
maybe
i
think
pointed
out
some
exceptional
circumstances
where
economics
will
not
permit
it.
now
unless
we
have
this
economics
imposed
on
us,
we've
been
able
to
--
forward
to
gather
it
and
sell
it.
now
i
would
point
out
too,
the
natural
gas
act
certainly
does
not
require
a
uniform.
a
uniform
price
is
alien
to
the
industry.
it
hasn't
even
been
a
matter
that
the
purchasers
have
embarked
upon
their
prices
in
the
same
field
at
the
same
time
are
generally
are
the
same.
but
between
purchasers,
there's
always
been
a
difference
in
price.
there
is
in
a
situation
here
that
have
been
pointed
to
where
they
say,
but
you
can't
make
money
anyhow.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we've
been
getting
along
very
well
at
our
contract
rates
and
the
contract
rates,
high,
low
or
otherwise
have
been
rates
that
the
public
not
only
could
afford
but
found
sufficiently
interesting
to
increase
their
demand
for
the
product.
i
certainly
can
assure
you
that
if
you
can
eliminate
any
high
percentage
of
the
50%
of
the
companies
who
will
not
make
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
in
their
gas
production,
there
is
an
absolute
shortage
tomorrow
if
that's
when
it
becomes
effective.
now,
i
would
also
call
to
you
--
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
justice
jackson's
dissent
in
hope,
he
recognized
that
in
this
situation
if
the
party
who's
rate
was
--
did
not
yield
a
fair
return,
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
business
and
was
compelled
by
some
other
reasons
to
stay
in,
then
the
court
--
he
was
suggesting
would
not
meet
constitutional
requirements
and
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here.
now,
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
moment
ago
was
that
there
can
be
absolutely
no
question
as
to
the
effect
of
the
holding
in
hope.
and
for
that,
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention,
the
decision
in
bowles
versus
willingham
which
involved
a
wartime
federal
rent
control
statute.
that
opinion
written
less
than
90
days
after
hope,
again,
by
mr.
justice
douglas
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
majority
of
the
court,
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
this
rent
control
line
and
the
natural
gas
act
because
congress
in
passing
the
natural
gas
act
provided
the
fixing
a
rates
which
are
just
and
reasonable
in
their
application
to
particular
companies
or
particular
parties
and
he
cited
hope
of
course
with
that
to
review.
now
then,
if
we
assume,
which
i
don't,
that
hope
is
not
governing
here
and
i
do
not
see
how
group
rate
fixing
can
be
established
without
overruling
hope.
and
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
second
phillips
did
that
because
second
phillips
relied
in
fact
on
hope.
second
phillips
says,
"first,
we're
not
going
to
render
advisory
opinions,
which
of
course
is
nothing
new
in
history
of
this
court,
and
they
didn't".
but
they
did
say
this,
they
said,
"we
can't
--
now
determine
that
the
method
employed
will
necessarily
result
in
a
rate
which
is
not
just
to
the
consumer
and
not
just
and
reasonable
to
the
producer,
a
rate
to
which
they
each
have
a
right".
that's
that
right
i
am
here
insisting
upon.
now,
if
the
act
doesn't
provide
for
group
rate
fixing
and
certainly
i
think
everybody
concedes
it
does
not
provide
for
it
and
the
question
is
does
it
prohibit?
then
if
it
doesn't,
then
by
what
standard
must
the
composition
of
groups
be
determined
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
act
provides
none.
now
obviously
if
the
federal
power
commission
can
pick
any
group
it
chooses,
then
by
the
very
constitution
of
the
group
itself
you
foreclose
and
foreordain
what
the
average
rate
will
be
and
what
appears
to
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
if
the
answer
of
it
that
--
well
it
doesn't
say
one
way
or
another
so
obviously
the
implication
is
that
they
may
create
reasonable
groups,
then
if
that'd
be
the
case
in
this
particular
proceeding
we
have
all
been
deprived
the
due
process
of
law
for
the
reason
of
that.
with
the
institution
of
the
proceeding
here,
the
commission
also
provided
in
the
very
same
law
that
they
would
not
entertain
objections
or
a
contention
to
the
effect
that
the
group
fixed
was
not
sufficient
for
rate
making
purposes.
and
we
have
been
deprived
of
that
and
therefore
as
i
say
we
have
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law.
thank
you.
