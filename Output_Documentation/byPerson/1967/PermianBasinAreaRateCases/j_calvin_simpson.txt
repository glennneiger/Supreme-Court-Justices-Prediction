mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
the
california
public
utilities
commission,
los
angeles,
san
francisco
and
san
diego
appear
before
this
court
to
urge
that
it
affirm
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
in
its
entirety,
whether
by
design
or
accident
when
the
commission
shows
the
permian
basin
area
of
west
texas
and
southeastern
new
mexico
to
initiate
this
pilot
pioneering
case.
it
involved
california
very
deeply
because
as
you
have
been
informed
on
the
basis
of
the
test
year
volumes,
approximately
85%
of
the
gas
produced
in
the
basin
is
consumed
in
the
california
market.
the
volumes
sold
from
the
permian
basin
have
increased
subsequently
and
my
best
information
now
is
that
the
volumes
are
larger,
but
that
we
consume
some
77%
of
the
gas.
in
appearing
before
this
court,
we
rep
--
we
feel
we
represent
the
consumer
interest
and
we
hope
that
we
can
give
some
perspective
to
your
evaluation
of
the
decision
through
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer.
that
the
consumer
interest
is
important
especially
in
california,
i
think
it
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
we
lack
economical
alternative
sources
of
energy,
not
only
for
residential
space
heating
and
the
like
but
also
for
the
generation
of
electric
power.
also,
we
have
a
very
severe
air
pollution
problem
in
california
which
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with.
therefore,
it's
very
important
to
the
economic
wellbeing
of
california
that
we
obtain
natural
gas
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rates.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes
sir,
we
do
and
the
--
i
think
that
the
statistic
show
that
for
residential
purposes
and
they
are
truly
the
captive
customers,
most
of
the
appliances
especially
for
space
heating
are
gas
burning
appliances
meaning
that
once
the
consumer
has
made
an
election
to
use
that
kind
of
fuel,
the
price
would
have
to
go
very
high
indeed
in
order
to
justify
as
discontinuing
the
use
of
his
durable
good
type
appliance
and
switching
to
something
else.
however,
industrially
speaking,
under
the
interruptible
rate
schedules
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
alternative
uses
or
rather
facilities
for
the
use
of
oil
in
steam
generation
plants.
but
there
is
a
drawback
to
that
because
the
oil,
unless
it's
a
very
special
low
salt
or
bearing
type,
does
create
air
pollution
problems.
therefore
the
city
of
los
angeles,
through
it's
air
pollution
control
district
has
a
rule
that
the
distributing
--
or
rather
that
the
steam
generation
plants
in
the
--
in
los
angeles
county
burn
natural
gas
to
the
extent
that
it
is
available.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
think
that
is
right
except
for
the
fact
that
we
do
not
at
the
present
time
have
coal
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
as
one
of
the
basic
sources
of
our
energy.
and
i
certainly
agree
with
you
sir
that
in
participating
in
this
case,
we
have
realized
that
our
job
is
not
completely
parochial
and
that
our
responses
to
the
problem
suppose
in
this
case
do
have
a
certain
national
importance
insofar
as
the
decision
in
this
case
may
stand
for
precedent
for
the
future
development
of
area
rate
making.
as
this
court
well
knows,
consumer
protection
is
the
primary
aim
of
the
natural
gas
act.
in
fact,
in
the
atlantic
refining
company
against
public
service
commission
of
new
york,
the
court
referred
to
the
natural
gas
act
by
indicating
that
it
was
framed
to
provide
consumers
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
of
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
certainly,
this
has
been
the
kind
of
bond
that
has
taken
a
very
long
time
indeed
to
mature.
we
have
waited
some
11
years
for
a
decision
from
the
federal
power
commission
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
independent
producers
in
measuring
that
period
of
time
between
this
court's
decision
in
phillips
petroleum
company
against
wisconsin
until
the
issuance
of
opinion
468
which
is
now
before
the
court.
and
of
course,
the
rest
of
the
time
has
elapsed
going
to
the
necessity
for
judicial
review
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
rate
reduction
portions
of
the
commission's
order,
they
have
been
stayed
by
the
court
below.
and
the
commission
itself
stayed
the
operation
of
the
refund
portion
of
its
order
in
this
case,
so
that
as
we
appear
before
the
court
right
now,
there's
still
no
relief
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
insofar
as
consumers
are
concerned.
despite
all
that,
or
ready
enough
in
--
not
in
spite
of
it
but
we
feel
as
though
certainly
the
time
has
come
that
the
solution
ought
to
be
before
us.
and
we
asked
that
the
court
affirm
the
commission's
decision
in
its
entirety
because
for
the
first
time,
an
effective
and
administratively
feasible
system
of
regulation
of
independent
producers
has
been
created.
for
the
first
time,
just
and
reasonable
rates
both
in
terms
of
section
4
and
section
5
of
the
act
had
been
established
by
the
commission.
and
we
think
this
is
important
too
for
the
first
time,
all
the
thickets
and
tangles
involved
with
the
suspect
price
doctrine
and
inline
pricing
with
which
i'm
sure
that
the
court
is
familiar,
that
too
will
be
a
disappearing
thing,
because
the
commission
has
indicated
that
it
expects
to
apply
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
determined
in
the
area
to
newly
certificated
sales
of
gas.
now,
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
correct.
in
developing
the
case
below
that
a
--
within
the
commission,
we
did
support
the
two-price
system.
in
fact,
we
went
along
the
little
different
route
from
some
of
the
other
economist
who
made
presentations,
california
was
the
only
party
to
present,
for
the
examiner's
consideration
a
--
an
estimated
cost
of
new
non-associated
gas-well
gas
which
was
based
on
area
cost
as
opposed
to
national
cost.
our
thought
being
that
the
purpose
behind
area
rate
making
was
to
the
extent
possible
to
focus
on
the
cost
experience
within
that
area
so
that
the
cost
of
the
gas
could
be
determined
for
the
area.
the
presiding
examiner
rejected
our
showing
in
that
regard
because
he
felt
that
it
would
--
that
it
relied
too
much
on
allocations
which
he
felt
were
not
reliable
basis
for
decision
when
one
is
attempting
to
find
an
economic
cost
of
gas
for
the
future
which
the
cost
of
the
new
gas-well
gas
is.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
it's
exhibit
number
222
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
and
it
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
it
shows
a
lower
cost
although
to
be
fair
about
it,
i
must
indicate
that
the
rate
of
return
of
which
california
relied
on
was
that
which
was
advanced
by
the
staff,
by
its
witness
dr.
shaffner
of
9
and
a
half
percent
whereas
the
commission
and
the
presiding
examiner
chose
12%.
it
was
mentioned
by
general
counsel
for
the
commission
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
his
argument
as
to
the
plight
in
which
we
found
ourselves
when
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
the
second
phillips.
it
is
true,
i
think
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
the
court
shows
that
within
--
the
closest
to
advocating
that
the
individual
company
cost
to
service
method
was
the
only
method
which
the
commission
ought
to
pursue.
just
to
amplify
that
a
little
bit,
first
of
all,
we're
not
here
to
reargue
second
phillips.
our
disappointment
in
the
result
there
was
that
we
were
very
much
afraid
that
the
development
of
area
rate
making
might
cast
itself
lose
entirely
from
any
kind
of
attention
to
costs.
our
concern
was
not
so
much
that
the
rates
would
be
predicated
on
individual
company
experience
as
that
the
rates
would
not
be
predicated
on
costs.
that
the
thinking
of
the
language
in
city
of
detroit
that
we
would
free
ourselves
completely
of
the
anchor
and
discard
all
of
the
experience
under
the
act
as
we
ventured
into
this
rather
uncharted
at
that
time
problem
of
devising
area
rates.
and
when
that
case
was
argued
before
this
court,
there
had
been
some
reason
to
believe
this
that
when
we
went
to
midland
in
1961,
one
of
the
producers,
in
fact
was
a
large
group
of
major
producers,
offered
the
commission
a
motion
which
indicated
that
no
individual
company
cost
of
service
data
would
be
allowed
in
the
case
as
admissible
evidence.
not
only
that,
but
no
group
of
cost
to
service
would
be
allowed
in,
only
cost
data.
now,
that's
a
peculiar
distinction,
what's
the
difference
between
cost
data
and
cost
of
the
service
data.
well,
i
suggest
although
i'm
not
sure
yet,
i
suggest
that
the
difference
is
that
you
take
the
raw
cost
trending
data
but
you
don't
match
it
up
with
respect
to
the
gas
that
is
sold.
and
we
thought
that
it
was
the
means
whereby
no
evaluation
of
the
profitability
of
the
rates
could
be
established.
it
was
not
until
1962,
in
fact,
may
14
of
1962
that
pursuant
to
our
motion,
the
commission
reversed
its
order
of
april
5,
1961
barring
all
costs
of
service
presentations
of
any
type
or
nature
from
the
case
and
said
that
upon
further
consideration
of
the
matter,
they
might
be
of
some
usefulness
and
we'll
let
them
into
the
record
for
whatever
use
they
may
provide.
and
i
think
that
that
might
give
the
court
some
perspective
as
to
the
long
journey
which
california
consumers
travel
through
this
case
to
reach
any
kind
of
cost
based
area
rates.
after
that,
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
put
in
complete
cost
of
service
presentations
with
respect
to
the
categories
of
the
gas
and
we
rely
very
heavily
upon
them.
now
just
why
is
it
that
we
are
so
concerned
about
costs?
is
this
just
some
sort
of
fixation?
i
think
not.
from
the
consumer
point
of
view,
we
think
that
the
alternative
are
notions
of
market
value
that
mark
that
value
and
we
are
convinced
speaking
for
consumers
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
situation
wherein
competition
has
proved
effective.
the
commission
has
so
found
in
this
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
approved
that
finding.
however,
i
don't
think
we
should
lose
sight
of
it
from
the
consumer
point
of
view
in
looking
at
the
commission's
decision.
and
that
of
course
comes
back
again
to
what
i
said
that
in
large
measure,
gas
consumers
do
not
have
a
choice
insofar,
as
their
costs
have
passed
on
to
the
interstate
pipeline
companies,
they
are
in
turn
passed
on
to
the
locally
regulated
california
distributors
in
this
case
pg&e,
pacific
lighting
companies
and
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
they
finally
end
up
in
a
little
brown
envelop
which
is
delivered
to
the
customer
and
are
paid
in
full.
they
can't
be
argued
about
consumers
rely
in
the
first
instance
upon
the
federal
power
commission
and
in
the
second
instance
in
our
situation
in
the
california
public
utilities
commission
for
protection.
they
cannot
delegate
this
function
to
huge
interstate
pipeline
companies
to
bargain
effectively
for
them,
for
we
are
convinced
that
if
the
pipeline
company
is
in
the
position
to
pass
on
these
costs,
their
incentive
to
bargain
is
--
at
least
it
is
fair
to
say
diminished
to
some
extent.
they
don't
have
a
buyer
who
can
say,
“i
don't
want
it”.
now
the
commission
to
our
great
--
the
commission
has
used
cost
in
this
case
and
this
is
of
course
we
think
very
important
and
permits
us
to
come
before
this
court
today
and
asked
that
this
be
affirmed.
the
commission
has
said
that
cost
provides
an
objective
price
standard
based
on
cost.
they
said
the
cost
is
the
bedrock
of
the
decision.
and
in
another
instance
it
said
that
it
is
the
nature
ingredient
of
the
decision.
now,
let
us
be
clear
about
this.
it
is
a
cost
based
decision.
it
is
not
entirely
based
on
costs.
its
cost
based
to
the
extent
that
new
gas-well
gas
which
is
gas
produced
not
in
association
with
oil.
and
old
gas-well
gas,
those
prices
are
based
on
cost.
however,
it's
--
it
has
been
pointed
out
to
you,
66%
of
the
gas
sold
in
the
permian
basin
area
is
oil-well
gas,
it's
not
the
gas-well
gas.
and
the
commission
has
said
because
of
its
disinclination
toward
making
allocations,
(inaudible)
myself
by
saying
that
we've
never
really
agreed
with
that
point
of
view.
we
think
that
allocations
can
be
made
by
rational
men
and
that
it
isn't
necessary
just
because
joint
costs
are
involved
simply
to
refuse
to
do
it.
but
we're
not
here
to
quarrel
about
that.
but
apparently
is
the
view
of
the
commission
that
it
is
to
be
avoided
wherever
possible
and
that
is
what
they've
done,
but
they
priced
most
of
the
gas
which
is
going
to
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
value.
well,
some
interesting
questions
arise
there.
one
wonders
whether
or
not
that
would
not
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
commission
had
had
no
idea
whatever
as
to
what
casinghead
and
residue
gas
costs.
would
it
have
been
an
appropriate
exercise
of
their
administrative
responsibilities
under
the
act
to
have
simply
priced
most
of
the
gas
at
the
gas-well
gas
price
but
the
commission
was
not
fully
unaware
as
to
what
the
cost
of
oil-well
gas
was.
the
staff
had
made
a
full
presentation
on
that.
all
of
the
parties,
california
and
the
california
distributors
took
the
point
of
view
that
the
gas
should
be
historically
caused
it.
so
that
--
we're
not
too
concerned
within
the
framework
of
this
particular
decision
that
the
value
has
been
misused,
we
think
that,
as
the
commission
itself
recognizes,
the
oil-well
gas
does
in
fact
costs
less
even
using
the
same
rate
of
return
and
not
changing
any
of
the
comparisons
than
gas-well
gas.
and
we
would
recommend
or
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
that
section
of
the
commission's
opinion
on
rehearing,
468-a
beginning
i
believe
at
1112d
called
revenues
versus
costs.
there,
the
commission
was
addressing
itself
to
be
problem
which
apparently
concerned
most
greatly
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
the
argument
that
costs
do
not
--
rather
that
revenues
do
not
balance
cost.
and
the
commission
was
fully
aware
of
this
argument
and
gave
consideration
there
to
it.
and
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
go
through
some
of
the
observations
that
the
commission
made
and
as
a
prelude
to
that
to
point
to
the
court,
that
with
each
one
of
these
observations,
i
think
it
should
be
realized
that
consumers
had
been
made
to
pay
a
price
that
these
are
matters
which
go
against
us.
the
commission
first
of
all
pointed
out
that
exploration
and
development
costs
were
allowed
at
4.08
cents
even
though
in
its
judgment,
the
oil-well
gas
was
found
as
a
byproduct
of
the
search
for
--
for
the
search
for
oil.
now,
that
there'd
be
no
misunderstanding
of
this,
that
4.08
cents
does
have
within
it,
when
you
look
at
the
cost
--
at
the
yardstick,
the
old
gas-well
gas
cost,
it
is
an
allocated
cost.
the
condensate
which
is
separated
at
the
least
does
bear
a
part
of
this
e
and
d
cost
that
is
being
reflected
over
to
the
old
flowing
oil-well
gas.
and
furthermore,
the
commission
reversed
the
examiner
or
refused
to
accept
his
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
spraberry
contracts.
these
are
contracts
for
the
sale
of
residue
gas
flowing
oil-well
residue
gas.
the
plants
are
owned
by
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
and
the
contractual
arrangement
between
it
and
the
producers
is
such
that
the
producer
is
paid
for
the
gas
at
the
well-gas
--
however
the
price
that
is
paid
to
him
is
figured
at
the
tailgate
of
the
plant
after
the
natural
gasoline
has
been
extracted
which
we
think
is
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
directing
those
plants.
moreover,
there
is
a
division
or
percentage
of
the
liquid
revenues
which
are
a
part
--
part
as
retained
by
el
paso
and
part
is
given
back
to
the
producer.
now,
the
commission
decided
that
this
contract
was
a
useful
mechanism
in
the
industry
and
permitted
it
to
remain
as
such
and
rationalized
the
result
in
the
ground
that
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
that
el
paso
did
not
retain
sufficient
of
the
liquid
revenues
to
offset
it's
costs
of
running
the
plant.
i
suggest
by
the
converse
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
contrary
is
not
true
and
if
it
is
not
true,
then
consumers
are
going
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
that
residue
gas
in
the
spraberry
contracts
than
otherwise.
the
truth
to
the
--
the
reason
that
we
say
that
is
that
el
paso
is
under
the
ordinary
approach
that
the
commission
takes
in
pipeline
cases
are
--
el
paso
is
required
to
credit
its
revenue
from
those
liquid
sales
to
its
cost
to
service
in
determining
our
pipeline
rates.
so
that
we
don't
end
up
paying
all
of
the
costs
of
the
plant
and
not
get
any
credit
whatever
for
some
of
the
revenues
which
had
been
enjoyed
by
el
paso
as
the
result
of
those
costs
inputs
in
the
plant.
our
problem
has
always
been
that
we've
been
unable
to
get
a
cost
for
the
plant
operations
in
order
to
determine
whether
el
paso
does
make
out
all
right
on
the
amount
of
the
liquid
revenues
which
it
attains
or
whether
it
goes
in
the
whole.
if
it
goes
in
the
whole,
we're
going
to
pay
the
bill.
but
rather,
the
commission
turned
its
attention
to
what
would
happen
to
the
--
it
turned
its
attention
to
the
commission,
or
rather
to
the
pipeline
and
said
that,
“well,
if
this
isn't
going
to
be
satisfactory,
well,
we
would
expect
you
to
renegotiate
with
the
producer”.
i
have
already
indicated
at
least
our
--
less
than
our
faith
in
the
motivation
that
the
pipeline
company
refused
to
undertake
those
negotiations
especially
in
view
that
they
can
pass
on
costs
to
the
consumer.
there's
one
other
item
too
which
is
right
in
the
same
thing
and
that
is
that
the
commission
in
this
discussion
points
out
that
in
constructing
its
yardstick
for
old
gas-well
gas,
they
did
not
include
a
plant
liquid
credit.
now,
such
a
credit
was
included
in
making
the
new
gas-well
gas
cost
study.
it
was
not
included
in
the
old
gas-well
gas
and
it
is
the
yardstick
that
is
applied
to
this
huge
resort
of
gas
which
is
sold
in
the
permian
basin.
the
distinction
there
is
that
although
the
--
there's
an
allocation
of
the
cost
to
take
care
of
the
revenues
and
liquids
which
are
separated
at
the
least.
there
was
an
old
allocation
of
the
plant
costs
because
the
plant
cost
were
not
even
figured
in
the
basic
cost.
however,
the
--
if
you're
going
to
strip
the
gas
beyond
the
least
and
extract
even
more
liquids
from
it,
then
it
would
appear
and
this
is
all
that
we
think
that
the
commission
was
saying
that
that
those
revenues
should
also
be
taken
into
account.
i
should
like
now
to
move
on
to
what
i
would
call
the
basic
finding
of
this
case
and
you'll
find
it
in
paragraph
4
of
the
further
findings
of
the
commission.
that's
at
687(d)
when
it
says
that
--
when
the
commission
says
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
past,
present
and
for
post
sales
of
natural
gas
to
which
this
order
applies
are
the
applicable
area
rates
set
forth
in
ordering
paragraphs
(a)
and
(b).
that
means
that
these
applicable
area
rates
should
perform
three
functions.
prospectively,
under
5(a)
they
are
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
here
after
observed.
under
4
(e)
they
are
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
which
have
to
be
applied
to
the
rate
schedules
to
calculate
refunds.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
would
replace
the
concept
of
in
lineness
which
is
presently
necessary
because
there
is
no
just
and
reasonable
rate
at
least
on
such
--
until
such
time
as
this
decision
is
affirmed
and
we
hope
it
will
be.
turning
to
the
refunds,
our
concept
of
refunds
is
that
is
--
that
is
merely
a
derived
calculation
under
the
act.
section
4
(e)
states
that
all
the
rates
of
the
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable
and
if
they're
not
just
and
reasonable,
they're
unlawful.
that's
a
very,
very
simple
straightforward
statement
we
think.
and
what
we
think
that
means
is
that
once
you've
determined
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is,
you
look
at
the
total
amount
of
money
that
was
collected
subject
to
refund
by
the
natural
gas
company
and
that
excess
must
be
refunded.
the
converse
of
corollary
of
this
is,
that
if
you
do
not
do
so,
then
you
must
really
be
finding
by
implication
at
least
that
the
--
that
to
the
extent
that
you
do
not
require
the
full
refund
of
--
the
whole
refund,
the
distance
between
the
amount
collected
subject
to
refund
and
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
what
--
what
we
argue
is
that
you
must
have
raised
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
by
implication.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
what
the
--
we
think
that
the
commission
was
very
explicit
right
in
its
opinion
in
specifying
what
the
refund
reports
should
show.
and
i
can't
remember
just
what
it
says
but
they
want
the
producers
to
pay
to
all
of
their
rate
schedules
and
indicate
what
rates
were
collected
subject
to
refund,
the
refund
obligation,
and
then
apply
to
them
the
applicable
area
rate.
and
of
course,
that
difference
is
the
amount
which
is
to
be
refunded.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
that
is
refundable.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
not
really.
we've
had
some
trouble
with
the
pipelines
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes
sir,
however,
the
commission
just
heard
an
argument
in
a
case
that
is
not
before
the
court
now
but
i
rather
think
it
will
be.
we're
in
--
there
is
--
the
commission
had
shown
a
concern
and
certainly
from
the
producer
or
rather
from
the
consumer
point
of
view,
we've
shown
a
concern
that
these
refunds
be
passed
through
the
pipelines
and
they
have
another
step
to
go
after
that.
they
have
to
go
through
the
locally
regulated
distributors
too.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
to
the
consumer,
that
is
certainly
our
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
position,
otherwise
we
feel
that
the
protection
given
us
by
section
4
(e)
of
the
act
–
well,
it
just
won't
be
there.
it
well
be
swallowed
by
somebody
else
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
very
well,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
can
answer
that.
with
respect
to
el
paso
and
transwestern
who
served
california,
we
presently
have
entered
into
agreements
with
them
that
arose
out
of
the
settlement
of
other
issues,
but
as
part
of
the
bargaining
in
those
settlement
conferences,
we
were
able
to
obtain
a
commitment
from
el
paso
and
from
transwestern
to
flow
these
refunds
through.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
well,
i
think
--
i
mean
all
of
the
--
yes,
because
i
only
used
the
word
“we”
is
because
we
were
the
party
along
with
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission,
i
should
certainly
add.
the
rule
insisted
that
these
provisions
be
concluded.
of
course
they
didn't
have
to
include
them.
but
the
commission
presently
has
a
policy
to
which
it
refers
in
opinion
468
that
they
will
not
release
refunds
from
producers
to
pipeline
companies
until
the
pipeline
company
indicates
to
the
commission
just
what
kind
of
disposition
it's
--
is
going
to
be
made
of
it.
we
could
go
all
further
into
this
by
equitable
entitlement
in
your
interstate
case
and
so
forth.
i
wonder
if
it
might
not
do
to
indicate
that
there
are
some
unsolved
problems
here
that
certainly
the
consumer
interest
are
doing
the
best
that
they
can
to
try
to
solve
them
because
--
although
it
may
just
be
brought
to
say
so,
we're
very
anxious
that
this
natural
gas
act
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
are
those
who
are
protected
by
its
primary
aim.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
don't
have
a
figure
for
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
can
--
i
--
my
guess
would
be,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
you
in
any
way.
it
might
at
the
range
of
--
we
think
it's
probably
when
this
is
all
over.
it
will
be
up
somewhere
around
$40
million
would
be
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
no.
no,
no,
no,
no.
hardly
--
i
didn't
mean
that
but
that
would
be
--
give
you
some
sort
of
a
gauge
of
the
amount
of
money
which
would
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
be
divided
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
well,
there
are
about
five
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes,
well,
i
don't
have
a
calculation
of
that.
but
and
so
there
really
would
be
no
point
in
my
trying
to
make
a
guess.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
i
will
say
that
when
we
did
receive
about
a
$136
million
in
refunds
which
were
actually
available
for
distribution
to
california
customers
that
figure
comes
to
my
mind.
the
refunds
among
residential
customers
ranged
all
the
way
from
--
as
i
recall
from
06
even
up
to
$10.
so
that
would
give
you
some
kind
of
a
–
although,
you
can
get
it
all
figured
out,
i
just
don't
--
i
have
not
meet
the
calculation.
before
leaving
the
refund
part
of
the
argument,
this
court
has
observed
that
re
--
that
the
refund
protection
section
4
(e)
is
a
very
disadvantageous
kind
of
relief.
we
don't
use
this
kind
of
relief
under
the
public
utilities
code
in
california.
we
used
a
different
system
which
does
not
involve
refunding
and
we
think
that
in
your
deliberations
on
the
refund
question
that
if
anything,
it
must
provide
a
sanction
against
filing
unwarranted
increased
rates
because
to
the
extent
that
that
can
happen,
they
just
borrow
the
consumers'
money.
and
that
if
we
read
the
refund
section
out
of
the
act
to
this
area
refund
concept
adopted
on
rehearing
by
the
court
of
appeals,
then
as
we
observed
in
our
brief,
the
sanction
of
individuals
making
up
their
own
minds
will
sound
as
in
the
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
an
increased
rate
can
be
justified
is
certainly
reduced,
because
once
again,
the
consumers
are
at
the
end
of
the
line
when
it
comes
to
the
refunds.
we
don't
think
there
should
be
any
trouble
at
all
in
the
commission's
observation
that
the
just
and
reasonable
price
should
become
the
inline
price
in
future
cases.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
notion
that
we're
dealing
here
with
just
a
limited
remand.
if
we
go
down
to
the
power
commission
again,
if
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
power
commission
in
it's
decision
has
indicated
that
there's
a
certain
degree
of
generosity
in
the
determinations
that
they
had
made
on
the
value
basis
and
if
we
are
going
to
reexamine
as
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
as
do,
the
12%
rate
of
return
which
was
expressly
made
that
high
in
order
to
protect
the
producers
from
quality
deduction
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
if
it
would
that
this
entire
opinion
468
in
our
judgment
at
least
is
an
interdependent
package.
there
are
many
considerations
which
have
to
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
entire
decision.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
changed
just
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
there
is
a
severe
danger
i
think
that
consumer
interest
who
have
decided
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
consumers
to
support
this
decision
that
they
go
back
only
for
corrections
the
other
way.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
power
commission.
we
objected
to
this
12%
rate
of
return.
we
objected
to
a
minimum
rate
of
9
cents.
and
we
objected
to
a
dividing
date
between
new
and
old
gas
of
the
--
of
january
1,
1961
because
the
very
basis
for
having
the
two-price
system
is
the
price
performed,
the
function
of
eliciting
supply
and
that
the
price
carrier
--
be
out
there
for
everyone
to
see
in
order
to
make
his
decisions
by
back
dating
it
to
the
1st
of
january
1961
that
didn't
--
was
not
in
accord
really
with
economic
theory
in
our
judgment
of
the
two-price
system.
there
is
no
question
that
in
our
mind
that
what
we
really
end
up
here
within
the
area
rate
making
is
a
just
and
reasonable
uniform
price.
as
mr.
solomon
in
the
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
indicated
that
the
price
could,
by
renegotiation
go
up
to
this
just
and
reasonable
price
and
the
commission
by
its
regulations,
if
the
contract
permits
it,
producers
can
file
up
to
it.
that's
the
theory
of
this.
there
is
--
when
you
say
that
the
price
is
just
and
reasonable,
then
there's
an
implication
that
that
people
want
to
be
able
to
get
it.
but
i
would
certainly
join
in
the
counsel's
concern
that
there
–
be
some
indication
on
the
part
of
the
pipelines
that
it's
--
that
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
for
changing
your
contracts,
because
fundamentally,
you
can
talk
about
group
rate
making
but
we
are
in
fact
fixing
rates
on
individual
producer
with
individual
sales.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
visualize
that
it
would
take
a
very
long
time
indeed.
it
would
take
a
long
time
on
the
balancing
in
my
judgment.
in
order
to
hear
all
the
arguments
about
whether
the
minimum
rate
should
come
up
to
the
ceiling
rate,
indeed
the
--
as
it
were,
the
floor,
whether
or
not
a
whole
system
of
non-uniform
rates
rather
than
uniform
rates
be
as
--
be
established
and
further
grant
--
the
court
has
also
indicated
that
we
have
to
go
back
into
the
quality
section
of
the
case
and
that
might
take
a
very
long
time
indeed
to
unravel
all
of
that.
i
would
bluntly
say
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
the
sense
of
its
balancing
notion
is
to
try
to
import
completely
the
notion
of
individual
company
cost
of
service
rate
making
over
to
the
area
rate
making
as
though
the
permian
basin
is
some
sort
of
super
corporation
and
of
course
it's
not.
it
is
many,
many
consumer
or
rather
many
producers
operating
in
the
area.
but
we
would
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
commission
might
have
to
start
all
over
again
and
in
fact,
we
would
have
to
make
certain
demands
that
it
do
start
all
over
again
because
we
have
trouble
with
the
idea
of
value
based
prices
being
balanced.
if
the
–
if
they
were
cost
based
then
causes
less
trouble.
but
they're
valued
based
and
we
know
that
there
is
something
extra
in
there
as
the
commission
itself
concedes.
so
we
do
think
it
would
take
a
considerable
length
of
time.
now
i
know
that
i've
made
many
critical
remarks
of
the
opinion.
but
let
me
close
by
saying
that
we
think
that
the
commission
has
done
a
responsible
job
that
it
has
addressed
itself
to
all
of
the
questions
that
this
very
complex
area
poses.
we
think
that
we
might
have
been
able
to
do
better
by
the
consumer
but
nevertheless,
we
think
that
all
of
the
prices
which
had
been
adjudged
in
this
case
are
in
–
are
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
albeit
as
we
see
at
page
32,
footnote
25
of
our
brief,
at
the
very
top
of
that
zone
of
reasonableness.
the
problem
of
the
contracts
apparently
is
going
to
be
a
transitional
thing.
we
would
expect
in
the
future
that
there
are
going
to
be
contracts
at
the
applicable
just
and
reasonable
area
rate.
we
ask
this
court
from
the
consumer
point
of
view
to
affirm
the
opinion
468
in
its
entirety.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
the
california
public
utilities
commission,
los
angeles,
san
francisco
and
san
diego
appear
before
this
court
to
urge
that
it
affirm
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
in
its
entirety,
whether
by
design
or
accident
when
the
commission
shows
the
permian
basin
area
of
west
texas
and
southeastern
new
mexico
to
initiate
this
pilot
pioneering
case.
it
involved
california
very
deeply
because
as
you
have
been
informed
on
the
basis
of
the
test
year
volumes,
approximately
85%
of
the
gas
produced
in
the
basin
is
consumed
in
the
california
market.
the
volumes
sold
from
the
permian
basin
have
increased
subsequently
and
my
best
information
now
is
that
the
volumes
are
larger,
but
that
we
consume
some
77%
of
the
gas.
in
appearing
before
this
court,
we
rep
--
we
feel
we
represent
the
consumer
interest
and
we
hope
that
we
can
give
some
perspective
to
your
evaluation
of
the
decision
through
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer.
that
the
consumer
interest
is
important
especially
in
california,
i
think
it
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
we
lack
economical
alternative
sources
of
energy,
not
only
for
residential
space
heating
and
the
like
but
also
for
the
generation
of
electric
power.
also,
we
have
a
very
severe
air
pollution
problem
in
california
which
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with.
therefore,
it's
very
important
to
the
economic
wellbeing
of
california
that
we
obtain
natural
gas
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rates.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes
sir,
we
do
and
the
--
i
think
that
the
statistic
show
that
for
residential
purposes
and
they
are
truly
the
captive
customers,
most
of
the
appliances
especially
for
space
heating
are
gas
burning
appliances
meaning
that
once
the
consumer
has
made
an
election
to
use
that
kind
of
fuel,
the
price
would
have
to
go
very
high
indeed
in
order
to
justify
as
discontinuing
the
use
of
his
durable
good
type
appliance
and
switching
to
something
else.
however,
industrially
speaking,
under
the
interruptible
rate
schedules
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
alternative
uses
or
rather
facilities
for
the
use
of
oil
in
steam
generation
plants.
but
there
is
a
drawback
to
that
because
the
oil,
unless
it's
a
very
special
low
salt
or
bearing
type,
does
create
air
pollution
problems.
therefore
the
city
of
los
angeles,
through
it's
air
pollution
control
district
has
a
rule
that
the
distributing
--
or
rather
that
the
steam
generation
plants
in
the
--
in
los
angeles
county
burn
natural
gas
to
the
extent
that
it
is
available.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
think
that
is
right
except
for
the
fact
that
we
do
not
at
the
present
time
have
coal
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
as
one
of
the
basic
sources
of
our
energy.
and
i
certainly
agree
with
you
sir
that
in
participating
in
this
case,
we
have
realized
that
our
job
is
not
completely
parochial
and
that
our
responses
to
the
problem
suppose
in
this
case
do
have
a
certain
national
importance
insofar
as
the
decision
in
this
case
may
stand
for
precedent
for
the
future
development
of
area
rate
making.
as
this
court
well
knows,
consumer
protection
is
the
primary
aim
of
the
natural
gas
act.
in
fact,
in
the
atlantic
refining
company
against
public
service
commission
of
new
york,
the
court
referred
to
the
natural
gas
act
by
indicating
that
it
was
framed
to
provide
consumers
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
of
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
certainly,
this
has
been
the
kind
of
bond
that
has
taken
a
very
long
time
indeed
to
mature.
we
have
waited
some
11
years
for
a
decision
from
the
federal
power
commission
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
independent
producers
in
measuring
that
period
of
time
between
this
court's
decision
in
phillips
petroleum
company
against
wisconsin
until
the
issuance
of
opinion
468
which
is
now
before
the
court.
and
of
course,
the
rest
of
the
time
has
elapsed
going
to
the
necessity
for
judicial
review
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
rate
reduction
portions
of
the
commission's
order,
they
have
been
stayed
by
the
court
below.
and
the
commission
itself
stayed
the
operation
of
the
refund
portion
of
its
order
in
this
case,
so
that
as
we
appear
before
the
court
right
now,
there's
still
no
relief
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
insofar
as
consumers
are
concerned.
despite
all
that,
or
ready
enough
in
--
not
in
spite
of
it
but
we
feel
as
though
certainly
the
time
has
come
that
the
solution
ought
to
be
before
us.
and
we
asked
that
the
court
affirm
the
commission's
decision
in
its
entirety
because
for
the
first
time,
an
effective
and
administratively
feasible
system
of
regulation
of
independent
producers
has
been
created.
for
the
first
time,
just
and
reasonable
rates
both
in
terms
of
section
4
and
section
5
of
the
act
had
been
established
by
the
commission.
and
we
think
this
is
important
too
for
the
first
time,
all
the
thickets
and
tangles
involved
with
the
suspect
price
doctrine
and
inline
pricing
with
which
i'm
sure
that
the
court
is
familiar,
that
too
will
be
a
disappearing
thing,
because
the
commission
has
indicated
that
it
expects
to
apply
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
determined
in
the
area
to
newly
certificated
sales
of
gas.
now,
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
correct.
in
developing
the
case
below
that
a
--
within
the
commission,
we
did
support
the
two-price
system.
in
fact,
we
went
along
the
little
different
route
from
some
of
the
other
economist
who
made
presentations,
california
was
the
only
party
to
present,
for
the
examiner's
consideration
a
--
an
estimated
cost
of
new
non-associated
gas-well
gas
which
was
based
on
area
cost
as
opposed
to
national
cost.
our
thought
being
that
the
purpose
behind
area
rate
making
was
to
the
extent
possible
to
focus
on
the
cost
experience
within
that
area
so
that
the
cost
of
the
gas
could
be
determined
for
the
area.
the
presiding
examiner
rejected
our
showing
in
that
regard
because
he
felt
that
it
would
--
that
it
relied
too
much
on
allocations
which
he
felt
were
not
reliable
basis
for
decision
when
one
is
attempting
to
find
an
economic
cost
of
gas
for
the
future
which
the
cost
of
the
new
gas-well
gas
is.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
it's
exhibit
number
222
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
and
it
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
it
shows
a
lower
cost
although
to
be
fair
about
it,
i
must
indicate
that
the
rate
of
return
of
which
california
relied
on
was
that
which
was
advanced
by
the
staff,
by
its
witness
dr.
shaffner
of
9
and
a
half
percent
whereas
the
commission
and
the
presiding
examiner
chose
12%.
it
was
mentioned
by
general
counsel
for
the
commission
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
his
argument
as
to
the
plight
in
which
we
found
ourselves
when
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
the
second
phillips.
it
is
true,
i
think
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
the
court
shows
that
within
--
the
closest
to
advocating
that
the
individual
company
cost
to
service
method
was
the
only
method
which
the
commission
ought
to
pursue.
just
to
amplify
that
a
little
bit,
first
of
all,
we're
not
here
to
reargue
second
phillips.
our
disappointment
in
the
result
there
was
that
we
were
very
much
afraid
that
the
development
of
area
rate
making
might
cast
itself
lose
entirely
from
any
kind
of
attention
to
costs.
our
concern
was
not
so
much
that
the
rates
would
be
predicated
on
individual
company
experience
as
that
the
rates
would
not
be
predicated
on
costs.
that
the
thinking
of
the
language
in
city
of
detroit
that
we
would
free
ourselves
completely
of
the
anchor
and
discard
all
of
the
experience
under
the
act
as
we
ventured
into
this
rather
uncharted
at
that
time
problem
of
devising
area
rates.
and
when
that
case
was
argued
before
this
court,
there
had
been
some
reason
to
believe
this
that
when
we
went
to
midland
in
1961,
one
of
the
producers,
in
fact
was
a
large
group
of
major
producers,
offered
the
commission
a
motion
which
indicated
that
no
individual
company
cost
of
service
data
would
be
allowed
in
the
case
as
admissible
evidence.
not
only
that,
but
no
group
of
cost
to
service
would
be
allowed
in,
only
cost
data.
now,
that's
a
peculiar
distinction,
what's
the
difference
between
cost
data
and
cost
of
the
service
data.
well,
i
suggest
although
i'm
not
sure
yet,
i
suggest
that
the
difference
is
that
you
take
the
raw
cost
trending
data
but
you
don't
match
it
up
with
respect
to
the
gas
that
is
sold.
and
we
thought
that
it
was
the
means
whereby
no
evaluation
of
the
profitability
of
the
rates
could
be
established.
it
was
not
until
1962,
in
fact,
may
14
of
1962
that
pursuant
to
our
motion,
the
commission
reversed
its
order
of
april
5,
1961
barring
all
costs
of
service
presentations
of
any
type
or
nature
from
the
case
and
said
that
upon
further
consideration
of
the
matter,
they
might
be
of
some
usefulness
and
we'll
let
them
into
the
record
for
whatever
use
they
may
provide.
and
i
think
that
that
might
give
the
court
some
perspective
as
to
the
long
journey
which
california
consumers
travel
through
this
case
to
reach
any
kind
of
cost
based
area
rates.
after
that,
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
put
in
complete
cost
of
service
presentations
with
respect
to
the
categories
of
the
gas
and
we
rely
very
heavily
upon
them.
now
just
why
is
it
that
we
are
so
concerned
about
costs?
is
this
just
some
sort
of
fixation?
i
think
not.
from
the
consumer
point
of
view,
we
think
that
the
alternative
are
notions
of
market
value
that
mark
that
value
and
we
are
convinced
speaking
for
consumers
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
situation
wherein
competition
has
proved
effective.
the
commission
has
so
found
in
this
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
approved
that
finding.
however,
i
don't
think
we
should
lose
sight
of
it
from
the
consumer
point
of
view
in
looking
at
the
commission's
decision.
and
that
of
course
comes
back
again
to
what
i
said
that
in
large
measure,
gas
consumers
do
not
have
a
choice
insofar,
as
their
costs
have
passed
on
to
the
interstate
pipeline
companies,
they
are
in
turn
passed
on
to
the
locally
regulated
california
distributors
in
this
case
pg&e,
pacific
lighting
companies
and
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
they
finally
end
up
in
a
little
brown
envelop
which
is
delivered
to
the
customer
and
are
paid
in
full.
they
can't
be
argued
about
consumers
rely
in
the
first
instance
upon
the
federal
power
commission
and
in
the
second
instance
in
our
situation
in
the
california
public
utilities
commission
for
protection.
they
cannot
delegate
this
function
to
huge
interstate
pipeline
companies
to
bargain
effectively
for
them,
for
we
are
convinced
that
if
the
pipeline
company
is
in
the
position
to
pass
on
these
costs,
their
incentive
to
bargain
is
--
at
least
it
is
fair
to
say
diminished
to
some
extent.
they
don't
have
a
buyer
who
can
say,
“i
don't
want
it”.
now
the
commission
to
our
great
--
the
commission
has
used
cost
in
this
case
and
this
is
of
course
we
think
very
important
and
permits
us
to
come
before
this
court
today
and
asked
that
this
be
affirmed.
the
commission
has
said
that
cost
provides
an
objective
price
standard
based
on
cost.
they
said
the
cost
is
the
bedrock
of
the
decision.
and
in
another
instance
it
said
that
it
is
the
nature
ingredient
of
the
decision.
now,
let
us
be
clear
about
this.
it
is
a
cost
based
decision.
it
is
not
entirely
based
on
costs.
its
cost
based
to
the
extent
that
new
gas-well
gas
which
is
gas
produced
not
in
association
with
oil.
and
old
gas-well
gas,
those
prices
are
based
on
cost.
however,
it's
--
it
has
been
pointed
out
to
you,
66%
of
the
gas
sold
in
the
permian
basin
area
is
oil-well
gas,
it's
not
the
gas-well
gas.
and
the
commission
has
said
because
of
its
disinclination
toward
making
allocations,
(inaudible)
myself
by
saying
that
we've
never
really
agreed
with
that
point
of
view.
we
think
that
allocations
can
be
made
by
rational
men
and
that
it
isn't
necessary
just
because
joint
costs
are
involved
simply
to
refuse
to
do
it.
but
we're
not
here
to
quarrel
about
that.
but
apparently
is
the
view
of
the
commission
that
it
is
to
be
avoided
wherever
possible
and
that
is
what
they've
done,
but
they
priced
most
of
the
gas
which
is
going
to
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
value.
well,
some
interesting
questions
arise
there.
one
wonders
whether
or
not
that
would
not
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
commission
had
had
no
idea
whatever
as
to
what
casinghead
and
residue
gas
costs.
would
it
have
been
an
appropriate
exercise
of
their
administrative
responsibilities
under
the
act
to
have
simply
priced
most
of
the
gas
at
the
gas-well
gas
price
but
the
commission
was
not
fully
unaware
as
to
what
the
cost
of
oil-well
gas
was.
the
staff
had
made
a
full
presentation
on
that.
all
of
the
parties,
california
and
the
california
distributors
took
the
point
of
view
that
the
gas
should
be
historically
caused
it.
so
that
--
we're
not
too
concerned
within
the
framework
of
this
particular
decision
that
the
value
has
been
misused,
we
think
that,
as
the
commission
itself
recognizes,
the
oil-well
gas
does
in
fact
costs
less
even
using
the
same
rate
of
return
and
not
changing
any
of
the
comparisons
than
gas-well
gas.
and
we
would
recommend
or
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
that
section
of
the
commission's
opinion
on
rehearing,
468-a
beginning
i
believe
at
1112d
called
revenues
versus
costs.
there,
the
commission
was
addressing
itself
to
be
problem
which
apparently
concerned
most
greatly
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
the
argument
that
costs
do
not
--
rather
that
revenues
do
not
balance
cost.
and
the
commission
was
fully
aware
of
this
argument
and
gave
consideration
there
to
it.
and
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
go
through
some
of
the
observations
that
the
commission
made
and
as
a
prelude
to
that
to
point
to
the
court,
that
with
each
one
of
these
observations,
i
think
it
should
be
realized
that
consumers
had
been
made
to
pay
a
price
that
these
are
matters
which
go
against
us.
the
commission
first
of
all
pointed
out
that
exploration
and
development
costs
were
allowed
at
4.08
cents
even
though
in
its
judgment,
the
oil-well
gas
was
found
as
a
byproduct
of
the
search
for
--
for
the
search
for
oil.
now,
that
there'd
be
no
misunderstanding
of
this,
that
4.08
cents
does
have
within
it,
when
you
look
at
the
cost
--
at
the
yardstick,
the
old
gas-well
gas
cost,
it
is
an
allocated
cost.
the
condensate
which
is
separated
at
the
least
does
bear
a
part
of
this
e
and
d
cost
that
is
being
reflected
over
to
the
old
flowing
oil-well
gas.
and
furthermore,
the
commission
reversed
the
examiner
or
refused
to
accept
his
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
spraberry
contracts.
these
are
contracts
for
the
sale
of
residue
gas
flowing
oil-well
residue
gas.
the
plants
are
owned
by
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
and
the
contractual
arrangement
between
it
and
the
producers
is
such
that
the
producer
is
paid
for
the
gas
at
the
well-gas
--
however
the
price
that
is
paid
to
him
is
figured
at
the
tailgate
of
the
plant
after
the
natural
gasoline
has
been
extracted
which
we
think
is
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
directing
those
plants.
moreover,
there
is
a
division
or
percentage
of
the
liquid
revenues
which
are
a
part
--
part
as
retained
by
el
paso
and
part
is
given
back
to
the
producer.
now,
the
commission
decided
that
this
contract
was
a
useful
mechanism
in
the
industry
and
permitted
it
to
remain
as
such
and
rationalized
the
result
in
the
ground
that
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
that
el
paso
did
not
retain
sufficient
of
the
liquid
revenues
to
offset
it's
costs
of
running
the
plant.
i
suggest
by
the
converse
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
contrary
is
not
true
and
if
it
is
not
true,
then
consumers
are
going
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
that
residue
gas
in
the
spraberry
contracts
than
otherwise.
the
truth
to
the
--
the
reason
that
we
say
that
is
that
el
paso
is
under
the
ordinary
approach
that
the
commission
takes
in
pipeline
cases
are
--
el
paso
is
required
to
credit
its
revenue
from
those
liquid
sales
to
its
cost
to
service
in
determining
our
pipeline
rates.
so
that
we
don't
end
up
paying
all
of
the
costs
of
the
plant
and
not
get
any
credit
whatever
for
some
of
the
revenues
which
had
been
enjoyed
by
el
paso
as
the
result
of
those
costs
inputs
in
the
plant.
our
problem
has
always
been
that
we've
been
unable
to
get
a
cost
for
the
plant
operations
in
order
to
determine
whether
el
paso
does
make
out
all
right
on
the
amount
of
the
liquid
revenues
which
it
attains
or
whether
it
goes
in
the
whole.
if
it
goes
in
the
whole,
we're
going
to
pay
the
bill.
but
rather,
the
commission
turned
its
attention
to
what
would
happen
to
the
--
it
turned
its
attention
to
the
commission,
or
rather
to
the
pipeline
and
said
that,
“well,
if
this
isn't
going
to
be
satisfactory,
well,
we
would
expect
you
to
renegotiate
with
the
producer”.
i
have
already
indicated
at
least
our
--
less
than
our
faith
in
the
motivation
that
the
pipeline
company
refused
to
undertake
those
negotiations
especially
in
view
that
they
can
pass
on
costs
to
the
consumer.
there's
one
other
item
too
which
is
right
in
the
same
thing
and
that
is
that
the
commission
in
this
discussion
points
out
that
in
constructing
its
yardstick
for
old
gas-well
gas,
they
did
not
include
a
plant
liquid
credit.
now,
such
a
credit
was
included
in
making
the
new
gas-well
gas
cost
study.
it
was
not
included
in
the
old
gas-well
gas
and
it
is
the
yardstick
that
is
applied
to
this
huge
resort
of
gas
which
is
sold
in
the
permian
basin.
the
distinction
there
is
that
although
the
--
there's
an
allocation
of
the
cost
to
take
care
of
the
revenues
and
liquids
which
are
separated
at
the
least.
there
was
an
old
allocation
of
the
plant
costs
because
the
plant
cost
were
not
even
figured
in
the
basic
cost.
however,
the
--
if
you're
going
to
strip
the
gas
beyond
the
least
and
extract
even
more
liquids
from
it,
then
it
would
appear
and
this
is
all
that
we
think
that
the
commission
was
saying
that
that
those
revenues
should
also
be
taken
into
account.
i
should
like
now
to
move
on
to
what
i
would
call
the
basic
finding
of
this
case
and
you'll
find
it
in
paragraph
4
of
the
further
findings
of
the
commission.
that's
at
687(d)
when
it
says
that
--
when
the
commission
says
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
past,
present
and
for
post
sales
of
natural
gas
to
which
this
order
applies
are
the
applicable
area
rates
set
forth
in
ordering
paragraphs
(a)
and
(b).
that
means
that
these
applicable
area
rates
should
perform
three
functions.
prospectively,
under
5(a)
they
are
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
here
after
observed.
under
4
(e)
they
are
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
which
have
to
be
applied
to
the
rate
schedules
to
calculate
refunds.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
would
replace
the
concept
of
in
lineness
which
is
presently
necessary
because
there
is
no
just
and
reasonable
rate
at
least
on
such
--
until
such
time
as
this
decision
is
affirmed
and
we
hope
it
will
be.
turning
to
the
refunds,
our
concept
of
refunds
is
that
is
--
that
is
merely
a
derived
calculation
under
the
act.
section
4
(e)
states
that
all
the
rates
of
the
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable
and
if
they're
not
just
and
reasonable,
they're
unlawful.
that's
a
very,
very
simple
straightforward
statement
we
think.
and
what
we
think
that
means
is
that
once
you've
determined
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is,
you
look
at
the
total
amount
of
money
that
was
collected
subject
to
refund
by
the
natural
gas
company
and
that
excess
must
be
refunded.
the
converse
of
corollary
of
this
is,
that
if
you
do
not
do
so,
then
you
must
really
be
finding
by
implication
at
least
that
the
--
that
to
the
extent
that
you
do
not
require
the
full
refund
of
--
the
whole
refund,
the
distance
between
the
amount
collected
subject
to
refund
and
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
what
--
what
we
argue
is
that
you
must
have
raised
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
by
implication.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
what
the
--
we
think
that
the
commission
was
very
explicit
right
in
its
opinion
in
specifying
what
the
refund
reports
should
show.
and
i
can't
remember
just
what
it
says
but
they
want
the
producers
to
pay
to
all
of
their
rate
schedules
and
indicate
what
rates
were
collected
subject
to
refund,
the
refund
obligation,
and
then
apply
to
them
the
applicable
area
rate.
and
of
course,
that
difference
is
the
amount
which
is
to
be
refunded.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
that
is
refundable.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
not
really.
we've
had
some
trouble
with
the
pipelines
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes
sir,
however,
the
commission
just
heard
an
argument
in
a
case
that
is
not
before
the
court
now
but
i
rather
think
it
will
be.
we're
in
--
there
is
--
the
commission
had
shown
a
concern
and
certainly
from
the
producer
or
rather
from
the
consumer
point
of
view,
we've
shown
a
concern
that
these
refunds
be
passed
through
the
pipelines
and
they
have
another
step
to
go
after
that.
they
have
to
go
through
the
locally
regulated
distributors
too.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
to
the
consumer,
that
is
certainly
our
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
position,
otherwise
we
feel
that
the
protection
given
us
by
section
4
(e)
of
the
act
–
well,
it
just
won't
be
there.
it
well
be
swallowed
by
somebody
else
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
very
well,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
can
answer
that.
with
respect
to
el
paso
and
transwestern
who
served
california,
we
presently
have
entered
into
agreements
with
them
that
arose
out
of
the
settlement
of
other
issues,
but
as
part
of
the
bargaining
in
those
settlement
conferences,
we
were
able
to
obtain
a
commitment
from
el
paso
and
from
transwestern
to
flow
these
refunds
through.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
well,
i
think
--
i
mean
all
of
the
--
yes,
because
i
only
used
the
word
“we”
is
because
we
were
the
party
along
with
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission,
i
should
certainly
add.
the
rule
insisted
that
these
provisions
be
concluded.
of
course
they
didn't
have
to
include
them.
but
the
commission
presently
has
a
policy
to
which
it
refers
in
opinion
468
that
they
will
not
release
refunds
from
producers
to
pipeline
companies
until
the
pipeline
company
indicates
to
the
commission
just
what
kind
of
disposition
it's
--
is
going
to
be
made
of
it.
we
could
go
all
further
into
this
by
equitable
entitlement
in
your
interstate
case
and
so
forth.
i
wonder
if
it
might
not
do
to
indicate
that
there
are
some
unsolved
problems
here
that
certainly
the
consumer
interest
are
doing
the
best
that
they
can
to
try
to
solve
them
because
--
although
it
may
just
be
brought
to
say
so,
we're
very
anxious
that
this
natural
gas
act
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
are
those
who
are
protected
by
its
primary
aim.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
don't
have
a
figure
for
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
can
--
i
--
my
guess
would
be,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
you
in
any
way.
it
might
at
the
range
of
--
we
think
it's
probably
when
this
is
all
over.
it
will
be
up
somewhere
around
$40
million
would
be
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
no.
no,
no,
no,
no.
hardly
--
i
didn't
mean
that
but
that
would
be
--
give
you
some
sort
of
a
gauge
of
the
amount
of
money
which
would
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
--
be
divided
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
well,
there
are
about
five
--
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
yes,
well,
i
don't
have
a
calculation
of
that.
but
and
so
there
really
would
be
no
point
in
my
trying
to
make
a
guess.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
i
will
say
that
when
we
did
receive
about
a
$136
million
in
refunds
which
were
actually
available
for
distribution
to
california
customers
that
figure
comes
to
my
mind.
the
refunds
among
residential
customers
ranged
all
the
way
from
--
as
i
recall
from
06
even
up
to
$10.
so
that
would
give
you
some
kind
of
a
–
although,
you
can
get
it
all
figured
out,
i
just
don't
--
i
have
not
meet
the
calculation.
before
leaving
the
refund
part
of
the
argument,
this
court
has
observed
that
re
--
that
the
refund
protection
section
4
(e)
is
a
very
disadvantageous
kind
of
relief.
we
don't
use
this
kind
of
relief
under
the
public
utilities
code
in
california.
we
used
a
different
system
which
does
not
involve
refunding
and
we
think
that
in
your
deliberations
on
the
refund
question
that
if
anything,
it
must
provide
a
sanction
against
filing
unwarranted
increased
rates
because
to
the
extent
that
that
can
happen,
they
just
borrow
the
consumers'
money.
and
that
if
we
read
the
refund
section
out
of
the
act
to
this
area
refund
concept
adopted
on
rehearing
by
the
court
of
appeals,
then
as
we
observed
in
our
brief,
the
sanction
of
individuals
making
up
their
own
minds
will
sound
as
in
the
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
an
increased
rate
can
be
justified
is
certainly
reduced,
because
once
again,
the
consumers
are
at
the
end
of
the
line
when
it
comes
to
the
refunds.
we
don't
think
there
should
be
any
trouble
at
all
in
the
commission's
observation
that
the
just
and
reasonable
price
should
become
the
inline
price
in
future
cases.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
notion
that
we're
dealing
here
with
just
a
limited
remand.
if
we
go
down
to
the
power
commission
again,
if
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
power
commission
in
it's
decision
has
indicated
that
there's
a
certain
degree
of
generosity
in
the
determinations
that
they
had
made
on
the
value
basis
and
if
we
are
going
to
reexamine
as
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
as
do,
the
12%
rate
of
return
which
was
expressly
made
that
high
in
order
to
protect
the
producers
from
quality
deduction
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
if
it
would
that
this
entire
opinion
468
in
our
judgment
at
least
is
an
interdependent
package.
there
are
many
considerations
which
have
to
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
entire
decision.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
changed
just
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
there
is
a
severe
danger
i
think
that
consumer
interest
who
have
decided
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
consumers
to
support
this
decision
that
they
go
back
only
for
corrections
the
other
way.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
power
commission.
we
objected
to
this
12%
rate
of
return.
we
objected
to
a
minimum
rate
of
9
cents.
and
we
objected
to
a
dividing
date
between
new
and
old
gas
of
the
--
of
january
1,
1961
because
the
very
basis
for
having
the
two-price
system
is
the
price
performed,
the
function
of
eliciting
supply
and
that
the
price
carrier
--
be
out
there
for
everyone
to
see
in
order
to
make
his
decisions
by
back
dating
it
to
the
1st
of
january
1961
that
didn't
--
was
not
in
accord
really
with
economic
theory
in
our
judgment
of
the
two-price
system.
there
is
no
question
that
in
our
mind
that
what
we
really
end
up
here
within
the
area
rate
making
is
a
just
and
reasonable
uniform
price.
as
mr.
solomon
in
the
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
indicated
that
the
price
could,
by
renegotiation
go
up
to
this
just
and
reasonable
price
and
the
commission
by
its
regulations,
if
the
contract
permits
it,
producers
can
file
up
to
it.
that's
the
theory
of
this.
there
is
--
when
you
say
that
the
price
is
just
and
reasonable,
then
there's
an
implication
that
that
people
want
to
be
able
to
get
it.
but
i
would
certainly
join
in
the
counsel's
concern
that
there
–
be
some
indication
on
the
part
of
the
pipelines
that
it's
--
that
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
for
changing
your
contracts,
because
fundamentally,
you
can
talk
about
group
rate
making
but
we
are
in
fact
fixing
rates
on
individual
producer
with
individual
sales.
mr.
j.
calvin
simpson
i
visualize
that
it
would
take
a
very
long
time
indeed.
it
would
take
a
long
time
on
the
balancing
in
my
judgment.
in
order
to
hear
all
the
arguments
about
whether
the
minimum
rate
should
come
up
to
the
ceiling
rate,
indeed
the
--
as
it
were,
the
floor,
whether
or
not
a
whole
system
of
non-uniform
rates
rather
than
uniform
rates
be
as
--
be
established
and
further
grant
--
the
court
has
also
indicated
that
we
have
to
go
back
into
the
quality
section
of
the
case
and
that
might
take
a
very
long
time
indeed
to
unravel
all
of
that.
i
would
bluntly
say
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
the
sense
of
its
balancing
notion
is
to
try
to
import
completely
the
notion
of
individual
company
cost
of
service
rate
making
over
to
the
area
rate
making
as
though
the
permian
basin
is
some
sort
of
super
corporation
and
of
course
it's
not.
it
is
many,
many
consumer
or
rather
many
producers
operating
in
the
area.
but
we
would
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
commission
might
have
to
start
all
over
again
and
in
fact,
we
would
have
to
make
certain
demands
that
it
do
start
all
over
again
because
we
have
trouble
with
the
idea
of
value
based
prices
being
balanced.
if
the
–
if
they
were
cost
based
then
causes
less
trouble.
but
they're
valued
based
and
we
know
that
there
is
something
extra
in
there
as
the
commission
itself
concedes.
so
we
do
think
it
would
take
a
considerable
length
of
time.
now
i
know
that
i've
made
many
critical
remarks
of
the
opinion.
but
let
me
close
by
saying
that
we
think
that
the
commission
has
done
a
responsible
job
that
it
has
addressed
itself
to
all
of
the
questions
that
this
very
complex
area
poses.
we
think
that
we
might
have
been
able
to
do
better
by
the
consumer
but
nevertheless,
we
think
that
all
of
the
prices
which
had
been
adjudged
in
this
case
are
in
–
are
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
albeit
as
we
see
at
page
32,
footnote
25
of
our
brief,
at
the
very
top
of
that
zone
of
reasonableness.
the
problem
of
the
contracts
apparently
is
going
to
be
a
transitional
thing.
we
would
expect
in
the
future
that
there
are
going
to
be
contracts
at
the
applicable
just
and
reasonable
area
rate.
we
ask
this
court
from
the
consumer
point
of
view
to
affirm
the
opinion
468
in
its
entirety.
