mr.
j.
evans
attwell
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
evans
attwell,
and
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
perry
r.
bass
et
al.
petitioners
in
number
105.
my
clients
have
the
somewhat
dubious
distinction
of
offering
the
largest
single
reduction
of
any
firm
certificated
price
in
the
permian
basin
area
as
a
result
of
the
area
rates
prescribed
by
the
commission
in
this
case.
during
the
time
allotted
me
for
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
focus
your
attention
on
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
include
any
amount
in
its
cost
base
area
rate
to
compensate
producers
such
as
my
client
for
a
substantial
out-of-pocket
cost
incurred
in
rendering,
gathering
and
treading
services
which
are
of
demonstrable
value
to
the
consumer
in
which
if
performed
by
a
pipeline
would
admittedly
be
included
in
the
pipeline's
cost
of
service
to
its
customers.
if
my
time
permits,
perhaps
after
lunch,
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
comment
on
a
procedural
due
process
question
concerning
the
quality
standard
set
by
the
commission.
from
the
consumer
standpoint,
the
natural
gas
business
is
divided
into
four
basic
functions.
first,
the
gas
must
be
found
and
produced
at
the
well
bed,
then
it
must
be
gathered
for
many
different
wells,
might
i
say
this
gathering
function
is
necessary
whether
it's
oil-well
gas,
whether
it's
gas-well
gas,
whether
it's
new
gas,
whether
it's
old
gas.
in
some
instances,
the
gas
contains
impurities
and
must
be
cleaned.
in
other
instances,
the
pressure
of
the
gas
is
too
low
and
it
must
be
compressed
before
it
can
be
delivered
to
the
interstate
pipeline
companies
which
transport
at
long
distances
to
distribution
companies
which
in
turn
sell
it
to
the
housewives
and
to
the
other
consumers.
now
each
of
these
functions
must
be
performed
if
gas
is
to
be
made
available
to
the
consumer
at
the
burned
tip.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
area
rates
in
this
case
were
fixed
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
computation
of
the
cost
of
gas
at
the
wellhead
that
is
before
gathering,
before
any
treading.
we
don't
challenge
any
of
those
false
computations.
what
we
do
challenge
is
that
the
commission
admittedly
did
not
determine
or
make
any
allowance
to
compensate
producers
such
as
my
clients
for
the
cost
they
incurred
performing
services
beyond
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
they
did.
i
think
that
mr.
solomon
dealt
with
it
yesterday.
mr.
justice
--
alright,
i
believe
that
he
said
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
was
--
i'm
planning
to
touch
on
that
and
meet
that
issue
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
but
as
i
understand
his
position,
he
says
that
if
they
bring
the
gas
up
to
the
quality
standard,
they're
compensated
because
they
get
the
ceiling
price.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
threefold.
first,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
no
processing
or
treading
cost
were
included
anywhere
in
the
cost
computations
used
by
the
commission
in
determining
its
area
rates.
i
think
secondly,
the
argument
of
the
commission
ignores
the
fact
that
these
processing
and
treading
services
actually
exceed
the
minimum
standards
prescribed
by
the
commission.
in
other
words,
my
client
for
instance,
they
compressed
the
gas
20%
more
than
the
commission
would
require
and
yet
they
get
no
compensation
for
that,
no
compensation
for
the
extra
cost
that
they
incur
to
doing.
and
of
course,
the
commission's
quality
standard
by
bringing
it
up
to
the
quality
standard
has
nothing
to
do
with
gathering
whatsoever.
if
the
gas
is
delivered
at
the
wellhead
the
area
price
applies.
if
it's
gathered
over
many,
many
miles
and
many,
many
thousands
of
acres,
the
price
is
the
same.
oh,
i
think
that
that's
the
answer
to
that.
what
we
really
challenge
here
is
that
the
commission
admittedly
did
not
determine
or
make
any
allowance
for
such
cost.
we
submit
that
in
fixing
area
rates
the
commission
simply
cannot
regard
--
disregard
actual
legitimate
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
gas
after
it
was
produced
but
before
it
is
delivered
to
pipelines.
this
cost
benefit
the
consumer
and
some
allocated
portion
should
have
been
allowed
by
the
commission
in
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
permian
basin.
such
gathering
and
treading
cost
actually
involves
millions
and
millions
of
dollars.
for
example,
my
clients
alone
own
and
operate
the
equivalent
of
253
miles
of
3-inch
pipeline
that
connect
and
gather
gas
from
hundreds
of
wells
over
many
thousands
of
acres.
we
have
installed
over
24,000
horsepower
compression
to
compress
the
gas
to
the
pressure
required
by
the
pipeline,
which
i
have
just
stated
is
actually
20%
higher
than
the
commission
standard.
our
investment
in
this
gathering
in
the
compression
plant
is
our
equipment
is
--
in
excess
of
$13.8
million.
of
course
the
total
investment
of
the
other
producers
in
the
permian
basin
rendering
similar
services
is
much
greater.
there
is
no
question
that
if
these
services
had
been
performed
by
pipelines,
they
would
have
been
included
in
the
pipelines
cost
of
service.
this
court
had
so
held
on
many
different
occasions.
it
follows
that
when
producers
such
as
my
client
provide
identical
services,
they
too
should
be
compensated
for
their
cost.
now
the
tenth
circuit
attempted
to
wash
its
hands
of
this
problem.
it
says
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
have
cost
of
gas
at
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
say
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
contending
that
if
that
wellhead
price
is
correct,
we
will
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
then
they
got
to
put
an
increment
on
top
of
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
of
area
basis
to
compensate
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
those
producers
in
the
area
adduced
in
these
amounts.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
precisely.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
for
certain
producers.
the
tenth
circuit
attempted
to
wash
its
hands
to
this
issue
with.
it
said
--
it
stated
and
i
quote
that
it
involved
the
troublesome
field
of
cost
allocations.
this
is
misleading
because
the
court
failed
to
recognize
that
the
commission
made
no
allocation
of
the
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
gas.
it
simply
did
not
include
allowance
of
any
kind
for
these
services.
our
complaint
is
not
that
the
commission
erred
in
allocating
the
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
but
that
it
completely
disregarded
such
cost
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
actual,
legitimate
and
necessary
cost
which
benefit
the
consumer
and
therefore
must
be
included
in
any
lawful
scheme
of
area
rate
regulation.
certainly,
there's
going
to
be
an
allocation
of
these
costs
between
gas
and
liquid.
it
has
going
to
have
to
be
made
but
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
made
in
the
first
instance
by
the
commission.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
question
stating
and
i
quote,
“the
producer's
argument
that
the
imposition
of
quality
standards
by
equal
due
process
because
of
lack
of
notice
need
not
be
resolved
at
this
time.
we
are
remanding
the
case
and
now
everyone
has
notice”.
therefore,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
tenth
circuit,
it
must
decide
this
serious
procedural
due
process
question.
we
submit
a
considerations
of
fundamental
fairness
required
that
the
commission
hold
supplemental
proceedings
in
which
all
parties
will
have
notice
of
the
quality
standard
and
price
reduction
issue
and
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
present
full
and
complete
evidence
on
that
issue.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
that
it
is
our
primary
position
in
this
case
as
expressed
in
our
application
for
certiorari
that
the
tenth
circuit
decision
should
be
affirmed.
we
believed
that
the
limited
remand
required
by
that
court
will
give
the
commission
the
opportunity
to
fill
obvious
procedure
and
evidentiary
gaps
in
this
--
its
first
area
ratings
firm.
certainly
such
a
remand
would
remove
the
procedural
due
process
question
we
have
raised
and
as
indicated
by
the
tenth
circuit
on
such
remands
perhaps
the
commission
will
allow
producers
are
gathering
costs
since
such
costs
allowed
in
pipelines.
however,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
tenth
circuit
decision,
we
submit
that
the
orders
of
the
commission
must
still
be
remanded
for
the
limited
purpose
of
having
the
commission
determine
what
increment
to
its
area
well
head
prices
should
be
allowed
producers
such
as
machlup
to
perform
extensive
gathering
and
trading
services
after
the
gas
is
produced
but
before
it
is
delivered
to
the
pipeline
purchasers.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
it
depends
up
on
the
definition
of
confiscation,
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
i
keep
considering
area
ratemaking
that
in
order
–-
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
for
it
to
be
legal
and
non-confiscatory
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
my
contention
is
that
on
an
overall
basis,
we
are
looking
at
an
area
of
ratemaking.
we
haven't
presented
any
individual
–-
halt
the
service
(inaudible)
such
as
there
are
individual
calls,
so
there's
none
of
that
in
this
record.
but
if
you
look
at
the
overall
area,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
--
our
point
is
simply
this.
that
if
the
commission
is
going
to
set
area
rates
legally,
it
must
include
in
those
where
area
rates,
all
actual
legitimate
costs
incurred
by
producers
in
order
to
make
the
gas
available
to
the
consumer.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
our
position
is
that
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
perhaps
i'm
--
i
misled
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
said
is
the
commission
has
determined
the
cost
of
the
well
gas.
now,
we've
incurred
costs
beyond
the
well
gas
certain
--
certain
producers.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
saying
that
a
--
--
a
legal
area
rate
will
have
to
in
it
–
as
to
those
producers
determine
another
cost,
it
--
be
tapped
--
packed
on
to
the
top
of
the
wellhead
cost.
and
the
commission
has
not
done
that.
there
is
a
gap
there.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
saying
as
an
industrial
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
have
to
look
at
this
as
an
industry,
halves
the
commission
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
early
in
the
game
the
commission
said
that
they
would
not
permit
my
client
to
put
on
individual
evidence
to
show
what
its
cost
were
and
the
--
we
did
not
--
but
it
--
there
was
any
such
evidence,
there's
none
in
the
records.
i'm
strictly
arguing
this
case
assuming
the
validity
of
the
area
rate
concept.
what
did
the
commission
do
wrong,
and
the
implementation
of
area
rates,
that
vis-à-vis.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
not
claiming
that
we
are
sufficiently
different
from
other
producers.
we're
saying
that
there
are
many,
not
many
but
are
considerable
number
of
other
producers
in
the
permian
basin
just
as
we
do
that
provide
these
services.
it's
an
area
concept.
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
allowance
for
an
area
wide
basis
for
gathering
and
trading
costs
as
to
those
producers
that
provide
that.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
the
court
of
appeal
said
two
things,
mr.
justice
douglas.
first,
they
said
that
we
were
trying
to
get
a
special
allowance
just
for
ourselves
just
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out.
that's
not
right.
we
have
used
our
own
circumstances
as
illustrative
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
others
in
the
industry,
other
producers
that
provide
extensive
gathering
and
trading
services.
secondly,
they
had
said,
this
involves
the
difficult
question
of
allocation
which
they
were
not
going
to
delve
into.
and
as
i
try
to
develop
before
lunch,
we're
not
arguing
about
any
allocation
issue
here.
we're
just
saying
that
they
didn't
include
any
cost.
now,
we
agreed
that
there
will
have
to
be
an
allocation
at
some
point
in
time
and
we
agreed
that
the
commission
is
the
--
is
a
proper
authority
to
make
that
at
least
in
the
first
instance.
so
that
the
--
the
question
really
is
the
complete
omission
of
any
allowance
for
gathering
and
trading
costs.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
they
did
leave
out
texas
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
think
they
made
out
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
it's
a
different
basis.
i
think
that
they
claim
that
texas
is
more
or
less
a
phantom
tax
and
that
producers
don't
actually
incur
texas
because
of
certain
tax
benefits
they
get.
but
there
is
no
question
that
here
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
we
spend
this
money.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
there
are
but
the
differences
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
because
of
the
difference
in
production
tax
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
there's
going
to
be
two
prices
between
those
two
different
areas,
yes
sir,
because
the
costs
are
different
in
those
two
areas
as
the
commission
determines.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that's
exactly
right
as
to
those
produces
that
do
provide
the
gathering
and
trading
services.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
some
of
the
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
would
say
we'd
want
an
increment
to
each
of
the
two
other
prices,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
might
give
you
four
prices
but
it
would
just
be
a
common
increment.
we'll
say
1
cent
per
mcf
on
top
of
the
14.5
and
1
cent
on
top
of
the
16.5.
i
wouldn't
differentiate
between
gathering
and
trading
services
as
to
old
gas
and
new
gas.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
evans
attwell,
and
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
perry
r.
bass
et
al.
petitioners
in
number
105.
my
clients
have
the
somewhat
dubious
distinction
of
offering
the
largest
single
reduction
of
any
firm
certificated
price
in
the
permian
basin
area
as
a
result
of
the
area
rates
prescribed
by
the
commission
in
this
case.
during
the
time
allotted
me
for
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
focus
your
attention
on
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
include
any
amount
in
its
cost
base
area
rate
to
compensate
producers
such
as
my
client
for
a
substantial
out-of-pocket
cost
incurred
in
rendering,
gathering
and
treading
services
which
are
of
demonstrable
value
to
the
consumer
in
which
if
performed
by
a
pipeline
would
admittedly
be
included
in
the
pipeline's
cost
of
service
to
its
customers.
if
my
time
permits,
perhaps
after
lunch,
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
comment
on
a
procedural
due
process
question
concerning
the
quality
standard
set
by
the
commission.
from
the
consumer
standpoint,
the
natural
gas
business
is
divided
into
four
basic
functions.
first,
the
gas
must
be
found
and
produced
at
the
well
bed,
then
it
must
be
gathered
for
many
different
wells,
might
i
say
this
gathering
function
is
necessary
whether
it's
oil-well
gas,
whether
it's
gas-well
gas,
whether
it's
new
gas,
whether
it's
old
gas.
in
some
instances,
the
gas
contains
impurities
and
must
be
cleaned.
in
other
instances,
the
pressure
of
the
gas
is
too
low
and
it
must
be
compressed
before
it
can
be
delivered
to
the
interstate
pipeline
companies
which
transport
at
long
distances
to
distribution
companies
which
in
turn
sell
it
to
the
housewives
and
to
the
other
consumers.
now
each
of
these
functions
must
be
performed
if
gas
is
to
be
made
available
to
the
consumer
at
the
burned
tip.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
area
rates
in
this
case
were
fixed
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
computation
of
the
cost
of
gas
at
the
wellhead
that
is
before
gathering,
before
any
treading.
we
don't
challenge
any
of
those
false
computations.
what
we
do
challenge
is
that
the
commission
admittedly
did
not
determine
or
make
any
allowance
to
compensate
producers
such
as
my
clients
for
the
cost
they
incurred
performing
services
beyond
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
they
did.
i
think
that
mr.
solomon
dealt
with
it
yesterday.
mr.
justice
--
alright,
i
believe
that
he
said
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
was
--
i'm
planning
to
touch
on
that
and
meet
that
issue
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
but
as
i
understand
his
position,
he
says
that
if
they
bring
the
gas
up
to
the
quality
standard,
they're
compensated
because
they
get
the
ceiling
price.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
threefold.
first,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
no
processing
or
treading
cost
were
included
anywhere
in
the
cost
computations
used
by
the
commission
in
determining
its
area
rates.
i
think
secondly,
the
argument
of
the
commission
ignores
the
fact
that
these
processing
and
treading
services
actually
exceed
the
minimum
standards
prescribed
by
the
commission.
in
other
words,
my
client
for
instance,
they
compressed
the
gas
20%
more
than
the
commission
would
require
and
yet
they
get
no
compensation
for
that,
no
compensation
for
the
extra
cost
that
they
incur
to
doing.
and
of
course,
the
commission's
quality
standard
by
bringing
it
up
to
the
quality
standard
has
nothing
to
do
with
gathering
whatsoever.
if
the
gas
is
delivered
at
the
wellhead
the
area
price
applies.
if
it's
gathered
over
many,
many
miles
and
many,
many
thousands
of
acres,
the
price
is
the
same.
oh,
i
think
that
that's
the
answer
to
that.
what
we
really
challenge
here
is
that
the
commission
admittedly
did
not
determine
or
make
any
allowance
for
such
cost.
we
submit
that
in
fixing
area
rates
the
commission
simply
cannot
regard
--
disregard
actual
legitimate
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
gas
after
it
was
produced
but
before
it
is
delivered
to
pipelines.
this
cost
benefit
the
consumer
and
some
allocated
portion
should
have
been
allowed
by
the
commission
in
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
permian
basin.
such
gathering
and
treading
cost
actually
involves
millions
and
millions
of
dollars.
for
example,
my
clients
alone
own
and
operate
the
equivalent
of
253
miles
of
3-inch
pipeline
that
connect
and
gather
gas
from
hundreds
of
wells
over
many
thousands
of
acres.
we
have
installed
over
24,000
horsepower
compression
to
compress
the
gas
to
the
pressure
required
by
the
pipeline,
which
i
have
just
stated
is
actually
20%
higher
than
the
commission
standard.
our
investment
in
this
gathering
in
the
compression
plant
is
our
equipment
is
--
in
excess
of
$13.8
million.
of
course
the
total
investment
of
the
other
producers
in
the
permian
basin
rendering
similar
services
is
much
greater.
there
is
no
question
that
if
these
services
had
been
performed
by
pipelines,
they
would
have
been
included
in
the
pipelines
cost
of
service.
this
court
had
so
held
on
many
different
occasions.
it
follows
that
when
producers
such
as
my
client
provide
identical
services,
they
too
should
be
compensated
for
their
cost.
now
the
tenth
circuit
attempted
to
wash
its
hands
of
this
problem.
it
says
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
have
cost
of
gas
at
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
say
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
contending
that
if
that
wellhead
price
is
correct,
we
will
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
then
they
got
to
put
an
increment
on
top
of
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
of
area
basis
to
compensate
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
those
producers
in
the
area
adduced
in
these
amounts.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
precisely.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
for
certain
producers.
the
tenth
circuit
attempted
to
wash
its
hands
to
this
issue
with.
it
said
--
it
stated
and
i
quote
that
it
involved
the
troublesome
field
of
cost
allocations.
this
is
misleading
because
the
court
failed
to
recognize
that
the
commission
made
no
allocation
of
the
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
gas.
it
simply
did
not
include
allowance
of
any
kind
for
these
services.
our
complaint
is
not
that
the
commission
erred
in
allocating
the
cost
of
gathering
and
treading
but
that
it
completely
disregarded
such
cost
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
actual,
legitimate
and
necessary
cost
which
benefit
the
consumer
and
therefore
must
be
included
in
any
lawful
scheme
of
area
rate
regulation.
certainly,
there's
going
to
be
an
allocation
of
these
costs
between
gas
and
liquid.
it
has
going
to
have
to
be
made
but
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
made
in
the
first
instance
by
the
commission.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
question
stating
and
i
quote,
“the
producer's
argument
that
the
imposition
of
quality
standards
by
equal
due
process
because
of
lack
of
notice
need
not
be
resolved
at
this
time.
we
are
remanding
the
case
and
now
everyone
has
notice”.
therefore,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
tenth
circuit,
it
must
decide
this
serious
procedural
due
process
question.
we
submit
a
considerations
of
fundamental
fairness
required
that
the
commission
hold
supplemental
proceedings
in
which
all
parties
will
have
notice
of
the
quality
standard
and
price
reduction
issue
and
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
present
full
and
complete
evidence
on
that
issue.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
that
it
is
our
primary
position
in
this
case
as
expressed
in
our
application
for
certiorari
that
the
tenth
circuit
decision
should
be
affirmed.
we
believed
that
the
limited
remand
required
by
that
court
will
give
the
commission
the
opportunity
to
fill
obvious
procedure
and
evidentiary
gaps
in
this
--
its
first
area
ratings
firm.
certainly
such
a
remand
would
remove
the
procedural
due
process
question
we
have
raised
and
as
indicated
by
the
tenth
circuit
on
such
remands
perhaps
the
commission
will
allow
producers
are
gathering
costs
since
such
costs
allowed
in
pipelines.
however,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
tenth
circuit
decision,
we
submit
that
the
orders
of
the
commission
must
still
be
remanded
for
the
limited
purpose
of
having
the
commission
determine
what
increment
to
its
area
well
head
prices
should
be
allowed
producers
such
as
machlup
to
perform
extensive
gathering
and
trading
services
after
the
gas
is
produced
but
before
it
is
delivered
to
the
pipeline
purchasers.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
it
depends
up
on
the
definition
of
confiscation,
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
i
keep
considering
area
ratemaking
that
in
order
–-
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
for
it
to
be
legal
and
non-confiscatory
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
my
contention
is
that
on
an
overall
basis,
we
are
looking
at
an
area
of
ratemaking.
we
haven't
presented
any
individual
–-
halt
the
service
(inaudible)
such
as
there
are
individual
calls,
so
there's
none
of
that
in
this
record.
but
if
you
look
at
the
overall
area,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
--
our
point
is
simply
this.
that
if
the
commission
is
going
to
set
area
rates
legally,
it
must
include
in
those
where
area
rates,
all
actual
legitimate
costs
incurred
by
producers
in
order
to
make
the
gas
available
to
the
consumer.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
our
position
is
that
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
perhaps
i'm
--
i
misled
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
said
is
the
commission
has
determined
the
cost
of
the
well
gas.
now,
we've
incurred
costs
beyond
the
well
gas
certain
--
certain
producers.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
saying
that
a
--
--
a
legal
area
rate
will
have
to
in
it
–
as
to
those
producers
determine
another
cost,
it
--
be
tapped
--
packed
on
to
the
top
of
the
wellhead
cost.
and
the
commission
has
not
done
that.
there
is
a
gap
there.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i'm
saying
as
an
industrial
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
have
to
look
at
this
as
an
industry,
halves
the
commission
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
early
in
the
game
the
commission
said
that
they
would
not
permit
my
client
to
put
on
individual
evidence
to
show
what
its
cost
were
and
the
--
we
did
not
--
but
it
--
there
was
any
such
evidence,
there's
none
in
the
records.
i'm
strictly
arguing
this
case
assuming
the
validity
of
the
area
rate
concept.
what
did
the
commission
do
wrong,
and
the
implementation
of
area
rates,
that
vis-à-vis.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
not
claiming
that
we
are
sufficiently
different
from
other
producers.
we're
saying
that
there
are
many,
not
many
but
are
considerable
number
of
other
producers
in
the
permian
basin
just
as
we
do
that
provide
these
services.
it's
an
area
concept.
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
allowance
for
an
area
wide
basis
for
gathering
and
trading
costs
as
to
those
producers
that
provide
that.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
the
court
of
appeal
said
two
things,
mr.
justice
douglas.
first,
they
said
that
we
were
trying
to
get
a
special
allowance
just
for
ourselves
just
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out.
that's
not
right.
we
have
used
our
own
circumstances
as
illustrative
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
others
in
the
industry,
other
producers
that
provide
extensive
gathering
and
trading
services.
secondly,
they
had
said,
this
involves
the
difficult
question
of
allocation
which
they
were
not
going
to
delve
into.
and
as
i
try
to
develop
before
lunch,
we're
not
arguing
about
any
allocation
issue
here.
we're
just
saying
that
they
didn't
include
any
cost.
now,
we
agreed
that
there
will
have
to
be
an
allocation
at
some
point
in
time
and
we
agreed
that
the
commission
is
the
--
is
a
proper
authority
to
make
that
at
least
in
the
first
instance.
so
that
the
--
the
question
really
is
the
complete
omission
of
any
allowance
for
gathering
and
trading
costs.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
they
did
leave
out
texas
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
think
they
made
out
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
it's
a
different
basis.
i
think
that
they
claim
that
texas
is
more
or
less
a
phantom
tax
and
that
producers
don't
actually
incur
texas
because
of
certain
tax
benefits
they
get.
but
there
is
no
question
that
here
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
--
we
spend
this
money.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
there
are
but
the
differences
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
because
of
the
difference
in
production
tax
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
there's
going
to
be
two
prices
between
those
two
different
areas,
yes
sir,
because
the
costs
are
different
in
those
two
areas
as
the
commission
determines.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that's
exactly
right
as
to
those
produces
that
do
provide
the
gathering
and
trading
services.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
some
of
the
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
would
say
we'd
want
an
increment
to
each
of
the
two
other
prices,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
might
give
you
four
prices
but
it
would
just
be
a
common
increment.
we'll
say
1
cent
per
mcf
on
top
of
the
14.5
and
1
cent
on
top
of
the
16.5.
i
wouldn't
differentiate
between
gathering
and
trading
services
as
to
old
gas
and
new
gas.
thank
you.
