mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
armour
and
i'm
here
before
the
court
today
on
behalf
of
mobil
oil
corporation
and
northern
natural
gas
producing
company,
petition
number
388.
in
the
20
minutes
allotted
to
mobil,
an
attempt
will
be
--
had
been
made
to
discuss
various
points,
the
moratorium,
the
ban
on
flexible
pricing
clauses,
the
last
clean
rate
argument,
the
automatic
application
of
section
7,
in
the
section
7
the
inline
argument,
the
minimum
rate
argument.
the
first
argument,
i'd
like
to
conserve,
would
be
that
of
the
moratorium.
as
was
stated
yesterday,
the
commission
by
its
order
placed
an
absolute
ban
on
all
contractually
allowable
rate
increases
above
the
area
maximum
from
the
date
--
from
the
effective
date
of
its
decision
which
is
september
1,
1965
until
january
1,
1968.
that
is
true
that
this
moratorium
will
expire
(inaudible)
before
the
court
renders
its
decision.
but
it
has
a
great
deal
of
importance
not
only
for
permian
but
for
the
other
area
rate
proceedings
that
are
now
in
progress.
and
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
be
emphasized
to
the
court
that
the
rules,
the
holding
in
the
permian
decision
will
set
the
basis
for
the
other
area
rate
proceedings
which
encompass
as
the
solicitor
told
you
yesterday
some
93%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce.
the
commission
attempts
to
justify
its
moratorium
in
two
basic
ways
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
january
1,
1968.
and
so
it
could
expire,
but
the
issue
is
far
from
moot
and
the
overall
approach
of
the
area
of
concept.
the
commission
attempts
to
justify
the
moratorium
in
two
basic
ways,
statutory
and
by
“reasonableness
test.”
now
first,
it's
statutory.
the
commission
tends
to
use
that
to
be
thereafter
observed
language
in
section
5
of
the
act.
now,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
to
allow
--
that
to
be
thereafter
observed
the
language
to
be
so
used
completely
ignores
the
entire
rate
changing
structure
of
the
act.
section
5
can
be
used
only
by
the
commission
by
certain
state
agencies
or
by
certain
distribution
companies.
a
natural
gas
company
cannot
institute
a
section
5
proceeding.
on
the
other
hand,
section
4
(e)
and
section
4
(d)
which
are
the
rate
changing
section
of
the
act
which
are
available
to
a
natural
gas
company
to
change
its
existing
rates
cannot
be
invoked
by
the
commission.
we
think
there's
a
complete
disregard
by
the
commission
in
using
that
to
be
thereafter
language
of
section
5.
now
previously
this
court
in
the
mobil
case,
in
the
memphis
case,
and
in
the
sunray
dx
case
held
emphatically
that
under
the
natural
gas
act
contrary
to
other
methods
of
regulation
employed
by
federal
agencies,
the
regulation
and
the
imposition
of
regulation
by
the
commission
is
superimposed
on
private
contracts.
and
this
court
in
mobil
specifically
held
that
when
a
contract
allows
the
producer
to
file
--
not
a
producer
but
the
seller
of
natural
gas,
the
natural
gas
company,
the
producer
wasn't
involved
but
it's
the
same
principle.
when
he's
--
when
his
contract
allows
a
filing
for
an
increased
rate,
he
may
file
under
section
4.
now
the
mere
filing
under
section
4
(d)
does
not
mean
that
the
filed
rate
becomes
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
congress
foresaw
this
problem.
and
before
the
file
rate
can
become
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
the
commission
must
find
itself.
that
is
true
that
after
five
months,
the
rate
can
be
placed
into
effect
but
subject
to
refund
if
the
commission
so
desires.
there
are
number
of
refunds
being
ordered
in
this
case
before
the
court
today
which
were
put
into
effect
under
this
very
same
power.
so
in
effect,
we
can
only
have
a
balancing
of
consumer
and
investor
interest.
the
producers
are
allowed
to
place
their
rates
into
effect
if
they
are
suspended
after
five
months
but
subject
to
refunding
and
under
bond.
now,
the
commission
also
attempts
to
use
as
a
justification
for
the
moratorium
certain
decisions
by
this
court
which
have
been
developed
in
the
interim
period
pending
development
of
the
area
method.
this
started
in
the
now
famous
case
of
catco
where
this
court
said
that
it
was
up
to
the
commission
to
hold
the
line
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
now,
the
hold
of
the
line
theory
has
been
applied
by
the
commission
in
numerous
ways.
one
of
the
ways
is
by
the
imposition
of
a
moratorium
on
either
a
temporary
or
permanent
certificate.
in
the
hunt
case,
decided
with
this
case
in
nine
--
presided
by
this
court
in
1964,
it
was
held
that
the
commission
could
impose
a
moratorium
on
a
temporary
certificate.
now,
the
moratorium
is
on
filing
under
section
4
(e).
at
--
in
the
hunt
case,
it
was
told
until
the
permanent
certificate
was
issued
but
now
in
callery,
in
1965,
this
court
then
said
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
under
section
7
not
under
section
4,
under
section
7
of
the
act
imposed
a
moratorium
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
whole
concept
that
hold
the
line,
all
the
doctrines
developed
and
the
hold
the
line
theory
have
been
approved
by
this
court
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
permian
decision,
the
decision
now
before
this
court
is
a
determination
of
what
the
commission
hopes
is
just
and
reasonable
rates.
this
is
not
an
interim
measure.
in
the
permian
decision,
the
period
of
pendency
has
ended.
now,
the
commission
also
attempts
to
use
the
power
given
to
it
under
section
16
of
the
act.
and
very
briefly
i
like
to
say
that
section
16,
in
and
out
of
itself,
is
not
an
independent
grant
of
power.
it
very
specifically
states
to
be
used
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
turning
now
with
the
court's
permission,
the
ban
on
flexible
pricing
clauses,
this
court
in
the
texas
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
l.
armour
the
moratorium
under
the
commission
as
i
understand
it
has
been
stayed
and
so
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
they
have
not
become
the
just
and
reasonable
rates.
mr.
james
l.
armour
because
the
commission
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
--
has
not
so
found.
mr.
james
l.
armour
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
james
l.
armour
that
is
true.
mr.
james
l.
armour
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
armour
well
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well
i
can't
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
can't
say
--
if
you
put
the
question
that
way,
they
haven't
been
heard
as
much
as
they
would
be
if
the
order
had
been
staged.
but
again,
let
me
emphasize
and
i
would
like
to
rest
it
on
this
if
i
may.
mr.
james
l.
armour
they
can
be
heard
very
definitely.
93%
of
the
gas
going
in
interstate
commerce
is
now
subject
to
area
proceeds.
if
this
court
approves
the
principle
and
moratorium
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
if
a
--
depending
upon
the
--
whether
the
court
decides
the
order
by
january
1,
1958.
mr.
james
l.
armour
the
moratorium
will
then
expire.
mr.
james
l.
armour
certainly
do,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well,
may
i
say
this
that
in
mobile
field
that
this
is
an
issue
which
perhaps
the
court
will
address
itself
to
--
in
setting
the
guidelines
for
the
area
rate
and
it
will
be
up
for
the
future,
for
the
other
93%.
it's
not
moot
in
that
respect
and
the
solicitor
made
the
same
point
to
the
court
yesterday
and
we
join
in
that.
if
i
may
turn
now
to
the
flexible
pricing
clause
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
said,
the
commission
by
its
permian
order
hopefully
has
said
what
it's
considered
to
be
just
unreasonable
rates.
the
mobil
has
objections
to
that.
mr.
james
l.
armour
as
i've
stated.
turning
now
to
the
flexible
pricing
clause
ban,
this
issue
has
been
before
the
court
before
in
the
texaco
case
decided
in
1964
also.
this
court
said
that
the
commission
by
the
use
of
the
rule
making
authority
could
ban
certain
flexible
pricing
clauses
in
contracts
to
be
filed
with
the
commission
in
the
future.
now
that
is
not
the
issue
presently
before
the
court.
the
issue
presently
before
the
court
is
the
order
of
the
commission
in
permian
banning
flexible
pricing
clauses
in
contracts
which
will
formally
file
with
the
commission
which
were
formally
approved
and
with
--
on
which
formal
approval
of
various
producers
committed
their
gas
interstate.
now
it
is
true
that
under
section
5
of
the
act
as
this
court
made
clear
in
texaco,
the
commission
can
change
existing
contracts
but
in
a
matter
which
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
as
this
court
said
in
hope,
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
is
a
balancing
of
consumer
and
investor
interest.
and
mobil
submits
it's
not
a
balance
of
consumer
investor
interest
to
completely
eliminate
these
clauses
and
thereby
trap
the
producers
in
a
situation
from
which
they
cannot
extricate
themselves.
turning
now
if
i
may
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
the
last
clean
rate
argument.
this
is
a
very
difficult
argument
to
state
and
in
the
interest
of
conserving
time,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
brief
which
mobil
has
filed,
pages
66
to
72
in
which
we
have
set
forth
a
very
detailed
example
of
what
we're
contending.
basically,
the
contention
is,
that
once
the
commission
has
permanently
certified
a
rate
then
while
it
may
reduce
that
rate
perspectively
under
section
5
(a),
it
cannot
because
a
section
4
(e)
increase
has
been
filed,
go
behind
its
permanent
rate.
now
this
court
in
the
hunt
case
stated
that
once
a
permanent
certificate
is
granted,
the
commission
can
correct
that
importer
rate
only
under
section
5
of
the
act.
and
as
long
ago
again
as
the
hope
case,
in
catco
and
again
in
callery,
this
court
has
been
very
straight
in
saying
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
rates
retroactively.
and
once
the
rate
is
fixed,
this
maybe
reduced
prospectively
but
not
retroactively.
now,
the
commission
and
in
particular
the
various
california
producers,
seem
to
contend
that
because
a
section
4
(e)
increase
has
been
filed
on
top
of
a
permanently
certified
rate,
that
a
reduction
maybe
made
down
to
the
area
rate
in
complete
disregard
of
this
permanent
certification.
again,
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
66
and
72
of
mobil
brief.
another
point
with
the
permission
of
the
court
which
i
would
like
to
bring
your
attention
is
discussed
in
pages
72
to
77
of
mobil's
brief.
and
this
involves
the
automatic
application
by
the
commission
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
which
they
purport
to
have
found
--
to
section
7
proceedings.
the
rate
is
based
on
a
1960
test
year.
and
under
the
commission's
order
as
the
mobil
interprets
it,
if
a
certificate
were
filed
today
and
an
attempt
were
made
under
section
7
to
have
that
rate
certified,
the
commission
would
use
the
rate
which
it
has
decided
on
the
1960
test
year.
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
states
the
certificates
are
to
be
based
on
the
present
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
we
think
that
that
means
a
present
showing
and
not
a
1960
test
year.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
decide
this
issue.
and
so
mobil's
position
on
this
must
be
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
commission,
then
this
one
issue
should
be
remanded
back
down
to
the
tenth
circuit
for
their
initial
decision.
it
has
never
been
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
they
reserved
their
decision
on
it.
of
course,
if
the
commission
is
reversed,
then
the
issue
would
go
back
to
the
commission.
turning
now
if
i
may
to
the
minimum
rate,
i
have
dwelled
at
length
upon
the
integrity
of
contracts
and
the
superimposition
of
rate
regulation
on
private
contracting.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
commission's
minimum
rate
are.
in
its
decision,
the
commission
set
a
minimum
rate
of
9
cents
subject
of
course
to
quality
deductions.
and
they
based
this
minimum
rate
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
sierra
case.
now
the
sierra
case
and
the
case
of
mobil
which
i
have
just
discussed
in
moratorium
are
both
decided
the
same
day
by
this
court,
february
the
27th,
1956.
now,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
including
a
minimum
rate
in
the
rate
designed
to
the
area
method.
and
it's
such
a
decision
is
just
and
reasonable,
but
mobil
contends
that
the
9
cent
level
is
too
low
and
cannot
be
supported
by
the
commission
rather
the
minimum
should
be
placed
at
a
level
which
would
allow
recovery
of
the
revenue
requirements
which
the
commission
has
established
for
the
permian
area.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
commission
in
following
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
phillips
2,
has
set
16.5
for
new
gas
and
14.5
for
old
gas
as
the
revenue
requirements
for
the
industry
collectively
in
the
permian
area.
now,
having
gone
this
far,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
rate
should
be
designed
which
will
allow
the
recovery
of
these
revenue
requirements.
now
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
this
would
be
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
we
just
said
that
rates
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
rates
that
are
set.
it's
the
rate
designed
as
the
14
and
15
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
as
the
minimum,
that
would
be
up
to
the
commission,
considering
the
fact
that
under
contract
limitations,
not
all
rates
are
uniform.
this
is
a
fact
of
life
under
the
natural
gas
act.
considering
also
that
as
we
have
contended,
rate
filings
above
should
be
allowed,
in
other
words
the
moratorium
should
be
relaxed.
and
that
somewhere
from
the
record,
a
minimum
can
be
said
which
will
allow
a
range
of
rates
which
will
allow
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i'm
quarrelling
with
the
9
cents,
yes.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
think
that
if
there's
not,
there
should
be,
considering
the
contract
limitations.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
am
arguing
that
9
cents
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
it
should
be
used.
the
commission
itself
stated
that
the
9
cent
will
only
provide
an
additional
$250,000.
now,
it's
purported
purpose
in
setting
the
minimum
basing
again
upon
the
decision
in
sierra
was
that
the
rate
received
by
a
producer
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
commission's
decision
at
671
(d),
the
rate
received
by
a
producer
must
not
be
so
low
as
to
prevent
or
retard
further
exploration
and
thereby
decrease
possible
discovery
of
gas
reserves
which
will
be
needed
by
consumers.
now
the
commission
itself
has
found
that
the
cost
of
new
gas,
the
average
cost
of
new
gas
is
16.5.
now,
don't
misunderstand
me.
i'm
not
saying
the
minimum
should
be
16.5,
but
i
think
that
should
be
some
indication
to
the
court
that
a
9
cent
minimum
which
only
produces
$250,000
doesn't
live
up
to
its
purpose.
mr.
james
l.
armour
under
the
group
procedures
which
they
have
used
following
the
mandate
of
phillips
2
to
set
rates
based
on
industry
averages,
yes
it
would
be
my
position
that
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
--
they
do
have
to
set
a
minimum.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
would
introduce
that
in
a
rate
designed
which
would
allow
recovery.
if
i
might
now
turn
to
quick
--
a
quick
word
as
to
the
rate
of
return
and
i
only
wish
to
say
very
briefly
that
the
commission
purported
to
allow
a
12%
rate
of
return.
however,
in
their
brief
to
this
court,
page
141,
we
now
find
that
the
commission
says
that
the
rate
of
return
was
only
to
be
allowed
on
gas
of
pipeline
quality.
and
that
in
actuality,
the
rate
is
something
like
10
and
three-fourths
on
new
gas,
and
9%
on
flowing
gas.
now
this
comes
as
a
better
shock
to
those
people
who
have
studied
the
commission's
decision.
in
the
record,
page
606
(d),
the
commission's
decision,
it
stated
that
the
rate
of
return
is
to
be
allowed
on
the
production
activities.
and
there's
no
mention
there
of
gas
of
pipeline
quality
or
anything
of
that
nature.
so,
most
of
the
position
is
that
if
the
impact
of
the
quality
deductions
are
going
to
reduce
the
rate
of
return
down
to
10
and
three-fourths
than
9,
then
perhaps
the
commission
should
again
raise
the
stated
rate
of
return
to
14
or
13
and
a
half
to
allow
the
actual
recovery
of
a
12%
rate.
thank
you.
mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
armour
and
i'm
here
before
the
court
today
on
behalf
of
mobil
oil
corporation
and
northern
natural
gas
producing
company,
petition
number
388.
in
the
20
minutes
allotted
to
mobil,
an
attempt
will
be
--
had
been
made
to
discuss
various
points,
the
moratorium,
the
ban
on
flexible
pricing
clauses,
the
last
clean
rate
argument,
the
automatic
application
of
section
7,
in
the
section
7
the
inline
argument,
the
minimum
rate
argument.
the
first
argument,
i'd
like
to
conserve,
would
be
that
of
the
moratorium.
as
was
stated
yesterday,
the
commission
by
its
order
placed
an
absolute
ban
on
all
contractually
allowable
rate
increases
above
the
area
maximum
from
the
date
--
from
the
effective
date
of
its
decision
which
is
september
1,
1965
until
january
1,
1968.
that
is
true
that
this
moratorium
will
expire
(inaudible)
before
the
court
renders
its
decision.
but
it
has
a
great
deal
of
importance
not
only
for
permian
but
for
the
other
area
rate
proceedings
that
are
now
in
progress.
and
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
be
emphasized
to
the
court
that
the
rules,
the
holding
in
the
permian
decision
will
set
the
basis
for
the
other
area
rate
proceedings
which
encompass
as
the
solicitor
told
you
yesterday
some
93%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce.
the
commission
attempts
to
justify
its
moratorium
in
two
basic
ways
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
january
1,
1968.
and
so
it
could
expire,
but
the
issue
is
far
from
moot
and
the
overall
approach
of
the
area
of
concept.
the
commission
attempts
to
justify
the
moratorium
in
two
basic
ways,
statutory
and
by
“reasonableness
test.”
now
first,
it's
statutory.
the
commission
tends
to
use
that
to
be
thereafter
observed
language
in
section
5
of
the
act.
now,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
to
allow
--
that
to
be
thereafter
observed
the
language
to
be
so
used
completely
ignores
the
entire
rate
changing
structure
of
the
act.
section
5
can
be
used
only
by
the
commission
by
certain
state
agencies
or
by
certain
distribution
companies.
a
natural
gas
company
cannot
institute
a
section
5
proceeding.
on
the
other
hand,
section
4
(e)
and
section
4
(d)
which
are
the
rate
changing
section
of
the
act
which
are
available
to
a
natural
gas
company
to
change
its
existing
rates
cannot
be
invoked
by
the
commission.
we
think
there's
a
complete
disregard
by
the
commission
in
using
that
to
be
thereafter
language
of
section
5.
now
previously
this
court
in
the
mobil
case,
in
the
memphis
case,
and
in
the
sunray
dx
case
held
emphatically
that
under
the
natural
gas
act
contrary
to
other
methods
of
regulation
employed
by
federal
agencies,
the
regulation
and
the
imposition
of
regulation
by
the
commission
is
superimposed
on
private
contracts.
and
this
court
in
mobil
specifically
held
that
when
a
contract
allows
the
producer
to
file
--
not
a
producer
but
the
seller
of
natural
gas,
the
natural
gas
company,
the
producer
wasn't
involved
but
it's
the
same
principle.
when
he's
--
when
his
contract
allows
a
filing
for
an
increased
rate,
he
may
file
under
section
4.
now
the
mere
filing
under
section
4
(d)
does
not
mean
that
the
filed
rate
becomes
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
congress
foresaw
this
problem.
and
before
the
file
rate
can
become
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
the
commission
must
find
itself.
that
is
true
that
after
five
months,
the
rate
can
be
placed
into
effect
but
subject
to
refund
if
the
commission
so
desires.
there
are
number
of
refunds
being
ordered
in
this
case
before
the
court
today
which
were
put
into
effect
under
this
very
same
power.
so
in
effect,
we
can
only
have
a
balancing
of
consumer
and
investor
interest.
the
producers
are
allowed
to
place
their
rates
into
effect
if
they
are
suspended
after
five
months
but
subject
to
refunding
and
under
bond.
now,
the
commission
also
attempts
to
use
as
a
justification
for
the
moratorium
certain
decisions
by
this
court
which
have
been
developed
in
the
interim
period
pending
development
of
the
area
method.
this
started
in
the
now
famous
case
of
catco
where
this
court
said
that
it
was
up
to
the
commission
to
hold
the
line
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
now,
the
hold
of
the
line
theory
has
been
applied
by
the
commission
in
numerous
ways.
one
of
the
ways
is
by
the
imposition
of
a
moratorium
on
either
a
temporary
or
permanent
certificate.
in
the
hunt
case,
decided
with
this
case
in
nine
--
presided
by
this
court
in
1964,
it
was
held
that
the
commission
could
impose
a
moratorium
on
a
temporary
certificate.
now,
the
moratorium
is
on
filing
under
section
4
(e).
at
--
in
the
hunt
case,
it
was
told
until
the
permanent
certificate
was
issued
but
now
in
callery,
in
1965,
this
court
then
said
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
under
section
7
not
under
section
4,
under
section
7
of
the
act
imposed
a
moratorium
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
whole
concept
that
hold
the
line,
all
the
doctrines
developed
and
the
hold
the
line
theory
have
been
approved
by
this
court
pending
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
permian
decision,
the
decision
now
before
this
court
is
a
determination
of
what
the
commission
hopes
is
just
and
reasonable
rates.
this
is
not
an
interim
measure.
in
the
permian
decision,
the
period
of
pendency
has
ended.
now,
the
commission
also
attempts
to
use
the
power
given
to
it
under
section
16
of
the
act.
and
very
briefly
i
like
to
say
that
section
16,
in
and
out
of
itself,
is
not
an
independent
grant
of
power.
it
very
specifically
states
to
be
used
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
turning
now
with
the
court's
permission,
the
ban
on
flexible
pricing
clauses,
this
court
in
the
texas
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
l.
armour
the
moratorium
under
the
commission
as
i
understand
it
has
been
stayed
and
so
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
they
have
not
become
the
just
and
reasonable
rates.
mr.
james
l.
armour
because
the
commission
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
--
has
not
so
found.
mr.
james
l.
armour
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
james
l.
armour
that
is
true.
mr.
james
l.
armour
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
armour
well
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well
i
can't
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
can't
say
--
if
you
put
the
question
that
way,
they
haven't
been
heard
as
much
as
they
would
be
if
the
order
had
been
staged.
but
again,
let
me
emphasize
and
i
would
like
to
rest
it
on
this
if
i
may.
mr.
james
l.
armour
they
can
be
heard
very
definitely.
93%
of
the
gas
going
in
interstate
commerce
is
now
subject
to
area
proceeds.
if
this
court
approves
the
principle
and
moratorium
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
if
a
--
depending
upon
the
--
whether
the
court
decides
the
order
by
january
1,
1958.
mr.
james
l.
armour
the
moratorium
will
then
expire.
mr.
james
l.
armour
certainly
do,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well,
may
i
say
this
that
in
mobile
field
that
this
is
an
issue
which
perhaps
the
court
will
address
itself
to
--
in
setting
the
guidelines
for
the
area
rate
and
it
will
be
up
for
the
future,
for
the
other
93%.
it's
not
moot
in
that
respect
and
the
solicitor
made
the
same
point
to
the
court
yesterday
and
we
join
in
that.
if
i
may
turn
now
to
the
flexible
pricing
clause
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
well,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
said,
the
commission
by
its
permian
order
hopefully
has
said
what
it's
considered
to
be
just
unreasonable
rates.
the
mobil
has
objections
to
that.
mr.
james
l.
armour
as
i've
stated.
turning
now
to
the
flexible
pricing
clause
ban,
this
issue
has
been
before
the
court
before
in
the
texaco
case
decided
in
1964
also.
this
court
said
that
the
commission
by
the
use
of
the
rule
making
authority
could
ban
certain
flexible
pricing
clauses
in
contracts
to
be
filed
with
the
commission
in
the
future.
now
that
is
not
the
issue
presently
before
the
court.
the
issue
presently
before
the
court
is
the
order
of
the
commission
in
permian
banning
flexible
pricing
clauses
in
contracts
which
will
formally
file
with
the
commission
which
were
formally
approved
and
with
--
on
which
formal
approval
of
various
producers
committed
their
gas
interstate.
now
it
is
true
that
under
section
5
of
the
act
as
this
court
made
clear
in
texaco,
the
commission
can
change
existing
contracts
but
in
a
matter
which
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
as
this
court
said
in
hope,
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
is
a
balancing
of
consumer
and
investor
interest.
and
mobil
submits
it's
not
a
balance
of
consumer
investor
interest
to
completely
eliminate
these
clauses
and
thereby
trap
the
producers
in
a
situation
from
which
they
cannot
extricate
themselves.
turning
now
if
i
may
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
the
last
clean
rate
argument.
this
is
a
very
difficult
argument
to
state
and
in
the
interest
of
conserving
time,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
brief
which
mobil
has
filed,
pages
66
to
72
in
which
we
have
set
forth
a
very
detailed
example
of
what
we're
contending.
basically,
the
contention
is,
that
once
the
commission
has
permanently
certified
a
rate
then
while
it
may
reduce
that
rate
perspectively
under
section
5
(a),
it
cannot
because
a
section
4
(e)
increase
has
been
filed,
go
behind
its
permanent
rate.
now
this
court
in
the
hunt
case
stated
that
once
a
permanent
certificate
is
granted,
the
commission
can
correct
that
importer
rate
only
under
section
5
of
the
act.
and
as
long
ago
again
as
the
hope
case,
in
catco
and
again
in
callery,
this
court
has
been
very
straight
in
saying
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
rates
retroactively.
and
once
the
rate
is
fixed,
this
maybe
reduced
prospectively
but
not
retroactively.
now,
the
commission
and
in
particular
the
various
california
producers,
seem
to
contend
that
because
a
section
4
(e)
increase
has
been
filed
on
top
of
a
permanently
certified
rate,
that
a
reduction
maybe
made
down
to
the
area
rate
in
complete
disregard
of
this
permanent
certification.
again,
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
66
and
72
of
mobil
brief.
another
point
with
the
permission
of
the
court
which
i
would
like
to
bring
your
attention
is
discussed
in
pages
72
to
77
of
mobil's
brief.
and
this
involves
the
automatic
application
by
the
commission
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
which
they
purport
to
have
found
--
to
section
7
proceedings.
the
rate
is
based
on
a
1960
test
year.
and
under
the
commission's
order
as
the
mobil
interprets
it,
if
a
certificate
were
filed
today
and
an
attempt
were
made
under
section
7
to
have
that
rate
certified,
the
commission
would
use
the
rate
which
it
has
decided
on
the
1960
test
year.
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
states
the
certificates
are
to
be
based
on
the
present
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
we
think
that
that
means
a
present
showing
and
not
a
1960
test
year.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
decide
this
issue.
and
so
mobil's
position
on
this
must
be
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
commission,
then
this
one
issue
should
be
remanded
back
down
to
the
tenth
circuit
for
their
initial
decision.
it
has
never
been
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
they
reserved
their
decision
on
it.
of
course,
if
the
commission
is
reversed,
then
the
issue
would
go
back
to
the
commission.
turning
now
if
i
may
to
the
minimum
rate,
i
have
dwelled
at
length
upon
the
integrity
of
contracts
and
the
superimposition
of
rate
regulation
on
private
contracting.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
commission's
minimum
rate
are.
in
its
decision,
the
commission
set
a
minimum
rate
of
9
cents
subject
of
course
to
quality
deductions.
and
they
based
this
minimum
rate
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
sierra
case.
now
the
sierra
case
and
the
case
of
mobil
which
i
have
just
discussed
in
moratorium
are
both
decided
the
same
day
by
this
court,
february
the
27th,
1956.
now,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
including
a
minimum
rate
in
the
rate
designed
to
the
area
method.
and
it's
such
a
decision
is
just
and
reasonable,
but
mobil
contends
that
the
9
cent
level
is
too
low
and
cannot
be
supported
by
the
commission
rather
the
minimum
should
be
placed
at
a
level
which
would
allow
recovery
of
the
revenue
requirements
which
the
commission
has
established
for
the
permian
area.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
commission
in
following
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
phillips
2,
has
set
16.5
for
new
gas
and
14.5
for
old
gas
as
the
revenue
requirements
for
the
industry
collectively
in
the
permian
area.
now,
having
gone
this
far,
it
is
mobil's
contention
that
rate
should
be
designed
which
will
allow
the
recovery
of
these
revenue
requirements.
now
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
this
would
be
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
we
just
said
that
rates
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
rates
that
are
set.
it's
the
rate
designed
as
the
14
and
15
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
as
the
minimum,
that
would
be
up
to
the
commission,
considering
the
fact
that
under
contract
limitations,
not
all
rates
are
uniform.
this
is
a
fact
of
life
under
the
natural
gas
act.
considering
also
that
as
we
have
contended,
rate
filings
above
should
be
allowed,
in
other
words
the
moratorium
should
be
relaxed.
and
that
somewhere
from
the
record,
a
minimum
can
be
said
which
will
allow
a
range
of
rates
which
will
allow
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
i'm
quarrelling
with
the
9
cents,
yes.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
think
that
if
there's
not,
there
should
be,
considering
the
contract
limitations.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
am
arguing
that
9
cents
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
it
should
be
used.
the
commission
itself
stated
that
the
9
cent
will
only
provide
an
additional
$250,000.
now,
it's
purported
purpose
in
setting
the
minimum
basing
again
upon
the
decision
in
sierra
was
that
the
rate
received
by
a
producer
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
commission's
decision
at
671
(d),
the
rate
received
by
a
producer
must
not
be
so
low
as
to
prevent
or
retard
further
exploration
and
thereby
decrease
possible
discovery
of
gas
reserves
which
will
be
needed
by
consumers.
now
the
commission
itself
has
found
that
the
cost
of
new
gas,
the
average
cost
of
new
gas
is
16.5.
now,
don't
misunderstand
me.
i'm
not
saying
the
minimum
should
be
16.5,
but
i
think
that
should
be
some
indication
to
the
court
that
a
9
cent
minimum
which
only
produces
$250,000
doesn't
live
up
to
its
purpose.
mr.
james
l.
armour
under
the
group
procedures
which
they
have
used
following
the
mandate
of
phillips
2
to
set
rates
based
on
industry
averages,
yes
it
would
be
my
position
that
--
mr.
james
l.
armour
--
they
do
have
to
set
a
minimum.
mr.
james
l.
armour
i
would
introduce
that
in
a
rate
designed
which
would
allow
recovery.
if
i
might
now
turn
to
quick
--
a
quick
word
as
to
the
rate
of
return
and
i
only
wish
to
say
very
briefly
that
the
commission
purported
to
allow
a
12%
rate
of
return.
however,
in
their
brief
to
this
court,
page
141,
we
now
find
that
the
commission
says
that
the
rate
of
return
was
only
to
be
allowed
on
gas
of
pipeline
quality.
and
that
in
actuality,
the
rate
is
something
like
10
and
three-fourths
on
new
gas,
and
9%
on
flowing
gas.
now
this
comes
as
a
better
shock
to
those
people
who
have
studied
the
commission's
decision.
in
the
record,
page
606
(d),
the
commission's
decision,
it
stated
that
the
rate
of
return
is
to
be
allowed
on
the
production
activities.
and
there's
no
mention
there
of
gas
of
pipeline
quality
or
anything
of
that
nature.
so,
most
of
the
position
is
that
if
the
impact
of
the
quality
deductions
are
going
to
reduce
the
rate
of
return
down
to
10
and
three-fourths
than
9,
then
perhaps
the
commission
should
again
raise
the
stated
rate
of
return
to
14
or
13
and
a
half
to
allow
the
actual
recovery
of
a
12%
rate.
thank
you.
