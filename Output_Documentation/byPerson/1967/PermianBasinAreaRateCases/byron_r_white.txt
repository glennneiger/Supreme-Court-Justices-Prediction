and
what
do
you

you
should
just

justice

white
well,
you
just
–
that
is
a
–
would
you
give
me
a
little
enlightening
up,
do
you
say
that
the
fellow
was
entitled
to
any

for
any
price
relief
just
because
he'd
been
making
the
12%
if
he
happens
to
be
a
high

producer.
but
(voice

--
justice

white
--
that
if
he
had
a
high
enough
cost,
if
he's
bad
enough
as
far
as
cost
wise
is
concerned,
you'd
give
him
price

justice
byron

white
well,
you
said
it
was
a
possibility?
justice
byron

white
so
why
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
give
him
a
price
relief
if
a
--
if
you
wouldn't

if
a

instead
of

above

you
don't
give

if
he's
over

--
a

by

you
do.
justice

white
that
doesn't
make
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
you
don't
put
--
justice

white
--
anybody
that
has
never

anything

a

--
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
can
you
give
me
an
example
that
allows
price
relief
for
the
situation
where
a

doesn't
cover
his
out-of-pocket

when
you
assumed
that
there
is

in

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
very
pretty
fuzzy
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
fuzzy
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
--
under
this
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
rate
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
from
circumstances
(inaudible)
which
are
or
probably
not
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
conservation
have
to
do
with
the
--
got
to
do
with
--
what
are
they
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
want
to
offer
evidence
to
prove
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
offered
the
evidence
that
the
reason
for
offering
them
was
to
prove
that
the
casinghead
gas
was
not
to
be
produced
in
an
economic
basis
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
what
you
offered
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so.
that
may
be
quite
so
but
were
you
also
claiming
that
the
pricing
the
commission
would
--
suggested
that
were
uneconomic?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
the
commission
knew
that
it
is
going
to
have
to
set
the
prices
to
be
economic,
isn't
it?
well,
i
mean
they
have
found
that
people
from
(inaudible)
that
the
average
producer
can
make
a
profit
of
these
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let's
assume
that's
true.
just
assume
with
me
for
a
moment
that
is
true.
now
how
about
if
that's
true,
are
the
conservation
of
this
--
new
mexico
include
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
average
producer
can
make
a
profit
at
that
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
--
let's
assume
that
he
can
make
a
profit
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
the
adjustments?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
quality
adjustments?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
assume
that
that's
not
so.
assume
that
they
can
make
a
profit.
now
your
conservation
interests
are
well
served
in
that
case.
i
mean
they're
not
damaged
in
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
yes,
but
if
it's
true
that
they
can
make
a
profit
at
this
rate
then
your
interests
are
not
damaged.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
that's
enough
(inaudible).
new
mexico's
interest
aren't
damaged
so
the
question
gets
back
to
whether
or
not
the
commission
--
the
reasonableness,
the
justice,
the
reason
was
–
of
the
rates
the
commission
fixed.
now,
that
question
to
say,
now
whether
--
whatever
your
conservation
is
concern.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there're
just
and
reasonable
in
this
interest,
they
--
that
they
can
make
a
profit
where
interests
are
not
damaged.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
considering
it
won't
change
the
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
wasn't
--
all
they
would
have
to
do
--
all
they
would
do
is
to
ensure
that
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
object
to
group
rate
fixing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
regardless
with
the
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
different
from
continentals?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
its
deal
price
basis
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
cost
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
ordinary
accounting
principles
this
--
you
--
will
roughly
cover
your
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
you
can
give
me
--
you're
placing
us
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you're
saying
this
rate
won't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
bankruptcy
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
just
want
to
know
is
what
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
by
whatever
method
you
were
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
without
the
gas
production,
you
wouldn't
produce
oil
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
address
themselves
to
it
at
all?
did
they
deal
with
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
that
the
commission
won't
let
you
do
it
now?
they
do
have
an
escape
cost
of
some
of
the
covered
companies.
i
don't
quite
know
what
it
covers
but
the
--
but
if
you're
different
from
the
--
here,
sufficiently
different
from
other
producers
for
--
from
area
rates
that
it
said,
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
--
you
could
present
that
kind
to
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
was
though
as
--
the
commission
has
left
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
really
did.
--
and
you
make
the
case
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
there
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
but
the
--
you're
claiming
that
this
is
all
the
commission
has
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they've
come
up,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
commission
has
not
yet
set
just
and
reasonable
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
stage
will
it
accept
just
and
reasonable
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
purport
find
just
and
reasonable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
didn't
the
commission
find
the
--
what
the
range
of
deductions
would
be.
they
may
not
know
what
the
specific
--
what
specific
thing
it
was
as
in
connection
with
every
company
or
with
every
producer
but
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
didn't
make
any
findings
to
what
this
quality
adjustments
would
be
in
terms
of
dollars
per
cent.
but
didn't
the
commission
find
that
it
would
be
something
like
0.7
or
up
to
1.5
or
something
like
that
per
mcf?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
finding
in
the
record
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
well,
anyway
the
commission
--
we
have
in
the
commission's
opinion
its
judgment
of
the
range,
of
cost
to
bring
gas
up
to
quality.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
--
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
this
pipeline
cost
to
bring
gas
up
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pipeline
quality
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
the
commission
just
took
that
statement
out
of
the
blue.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
there
some
basis
for
it
then
whether
it
was
pipeline
cost,
they're
not
--
there
are
some
other
basis
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
shouldn't
in
this
area
approach
it
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
escape
clauses?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
escape
clauses?
no
individualizations
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
some
purposes
even
individualized
and
not
--
but
not
for
refunds.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
el
paso
is
collecting
14
point
whatever
it
is
plus
x,
they've
been
collecting
an
excess
of
the
maximum
rate
at
sometime.
the
only
reason
that
they
shouldn't
get
refunds
is
because
of
a
--
is
because
some
other
people
in
the
--
producing
in
the
basin
have
not
been
doing
so
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
bought
some
gas
from
some
producers
at
much
lower
prices
from
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
were
below
the
--
the
price
is
somewhere
above
obviously
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
was
an
average
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
commission
says
that
--
instead
of
a
no
roll
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
in
effect
says
that
determining
a
refund
should
be
--
you
don't
add
them
all
up
together,
even
in
the
case
of
el
paso.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to.
i
guess
they're
regulating
the
producers'
prices
is
not
the
seller's
ag
--
buyer's
aggregate
cost.
justice
byron

white
but
mr.

justice

oh,
at

of

it
says

they

they

the

found?
justice

white
what
was
wrong
and
if
there's
any

justice

white
so
it's
all
in
the
refunds,
mr.
solomon?
justice

if
your

if
the

question
to
say,
now
whether
--
whatever
your
conservation
is
concern.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there're
just
and
reasonable
in
this
interest,
they
--
that
they
can
make
a
profit
where
interests
are
not
damaged.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
considering
it
won't
change
the
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
wasn't
--
all
they
would
have
to
do
--
all
they
would
do
is
to
ensure
that
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
object
to
group
rate
fixing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
regardless
with
the
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
different
from
continentals?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
its
deal
price
basis
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
cost
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
ordinary
accounting
principles
this
--
you
--
will
roughly
cover
your
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
you
can
give
me
--
you're
placing
us
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you're
saying
this
rate
won't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
bankruptcy
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
just
want
to
know
is
what
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
by
whatever
method
you
were
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
without
the
gas
production,
you
wouldn't
produce
oil
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
address
themselves
to
it
at
all?
did
they
deal
with
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
that
the
commission
won't
let
you
do
it
now?
they
do
have
an
escape
cost
of
some
of
the
covered
companies.
i
don't
quite
know
what
it
covers
but
the
--
but
if
you're
different
from
the
--
here,
sufficiently
different
from
other
producers
for
--
from
area
rates
that
it
said,
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
--
you
could
present
that
kind
to
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
was
though
as
--
the
commission
has
left
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
really
did.
--
and
you
make
the
case
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
you're
claiming
that
this
is
all
the
commission
has
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they've
come
up,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
commission
has
not
yet
set
just
and
reasonable
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
stage
will
it
accept
just
and
reasonable
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
purport
find
just
and
reasonable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
didn't
the
commission
find
the
--
what
the
range
of
deductions
would
be.
they
may
not
know
what
the
specific
--
what
specific
thing
it
was
as
in
connection
with
every
company
or
with
every
producer
but
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
didn't
make
any
findings
to
what
this
quality
adjustments
would
be
in
terms
of
dollars
per
cent.
but
didn't
the
commission
find
that
it
would
be
something
like
0.7
or
up
to
1.5
or
something
like
that
per
mcf?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
finding
in
the
record
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
well,
anyway
the
commission
--
we
have
in
the
commission's
opinion
its
judgment
of
the
range,
of
cost
to
bring
gas
up
to
quality.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
--
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
this
pipeline
cost
to
bring
gas
up
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pipeline
quality
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
the
commission
just
took
that
statement
out
of
the
blue.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
there
some
basis
for
it
then
whether
it
was
pipeline
cost,
they're
not
--
there
are
some
other
basis
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
shouldn't
in
this
area
approach
it
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
escape
clauses?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
escape
clauses?
no
individualizations
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
some
purposes
even
individualized
and
not
--
but
not
for
refunds.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
el
paso
is
collecting
14
point
whatever
it
is
plus
x,
they've
been
collecting
an
excess
of
the
maximum
rate
at
sometime.
the
only
reason
that
they
shouldn't
get
refunds
is
because
of
a
--
is
because
some
other
people
in
the
--
producing
in
the
basin
have
not
been
doing
so
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
bought
some
gas
from
some
producers
at
much
lower
prices
from
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
were
below
the
--
the
price
is
somewhere
above
obviously
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
was
an
average
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
commission
says
that
--
instead
of
a
no
roll
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
in
effect
says
that
determining
a
refund
should
be
--
you
don't
add
them
all
up
together,
even
in
the
case
of
el
paso.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to.
i
guess
they're
regulating
the
producers'
prices
is
not
the
seller's
ag
--
buyer's
aggregate
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
gilliam
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
at
page
34
of
your
brief,
it
says
--
they
say
that
the
permian
gas
(inaudible)
that
page
that
the
turning
gas
(inaudible)
in
a
range
of
0.7
to
point
--
to
1.5
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
say,
and
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
wrong
and
if
there's
any
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
all
in
the
refunds,
mr.
solomon?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
--
if
the
commission's
moratorium
order
is
upheld
this
would
result
in
a
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
stay
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
filed
increase
(voice

justice
byron

yes.
