mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
case
on
clause
appeals
from
the
tenth
circuit
presents
for
the
court's
consideration,
the
validity
of
the
federal
power
commission's
first
area
rate
determination
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
sale
by
producers
of
natural
gas
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
the
particular
decision
here
involves
the
so-called
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico,
which
is
a
major
producing
area
responsible
for
approximately
12%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce.
off
of
this
gas,
roughly
three-quarters,
a
little
bit
more
than
three-quarters,
goes
to
the
california
market
and
the
remainder
to
on-route
are
points
in
arizona,
new
mexico,
texas
and
by
another
pipeline
to
the
midwest.
the
prices
fixed
by
the
commission
in
this
case
will
result
in
refunds.
that
is
refunds
with
respect
to
increased
prices
which
had
previously
been
suspended
by
the
commission
and
allowed
to
go
into
effect
subject
to
the
refund
obligation
of
approximately
$32
million
plus
interest.
in
addition,
and
certainly
no
less
important,
the
decision
will
result
in
annual
rate
reductions
beginning
as
of
september
1st,
1965,
the
date
of
the
commission's
decision,
of
approximately
$16
million
a
year.
but
obviously,
the
decision
although
important
for
itself,
has
greater
importance
in
establishing
the
legal
framework
for
all
producer
ratemaking.
and
this
includes
the
four
other
cases
that
we
now
have
before
the
commission
in
various
stages
which
together
with
permian,
when
they
are
completed
will
fix
the
rates
for
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce
approximately
93%.
in
other
words,
with
these
first
five
cases
by
process
of
packaging,
we
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
93%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir,
the
one
which
is
nearest
to
being
completed
is
the
southern
louisiana
area.
there
is
a
case
involving
the
so-called
hugoton-anadarko
area
of
kansas,
oklahoma,
and
texas.
there
is
a
case
which
is
concurrent
with
it
which
involves
three
of
the
texas
railroad
districts
along
the
gulf
of
texas.
and
there
are
some
newer
cases
which
has
packaged
all
of
the
areas
in
between
in
the
southwest
which
probably
will
depend
on
how
you
split
them
up
where
they're
closer
to
one
group
or
another.
yes,
it
is
different
areas.
we
are
strongly
urging
in
this
case
that
the
commission's
decision
be
infirmed
in
its
entirety.
now,
the
genesis
of
the
action
under
review
here
today
is
of
course
the
commission
--
this
court's
decision
in
1954
in
the
phillips
case,
hearing
of
347.
it's
first
held
with
the
rates
which
natural
gas
producers
should
sell
their
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce,
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission.
i
don't
think
i
really
have
to
go
into
detail
with
this
court
as
to
the
history
during
the
succeeding
six
years,
or
rather
a
board
of
history
of
the
commission's
attempts
to
resolve
this
price
in
question
by
conventional
individual
company
cost
of
service
rate
making
technique.
as
you
are
aware,
in
the
second
phillips
case,
which
in
this
court
is
styled
wisconsin
against
the
federal
power
commission,
decided
in
1962
in
volume
373.
in
the
second
phillips
case,
the
commission
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
individual
company
prudent
investment
cost
of
service
technique
made
no
sense
for
the
natural
gas
industry,
economically,
administratively
does
not
acquire
it
legally.
instead,
it's
cited
that
would
institute
these
area
rate
proceedings
of
which
this
is
the
first.
in
the
interim,
building
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case,
the
commission
has
utilized
its
conditioning
authority
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
to
as
the
court
put
it,
hold
the
line,
this
program
has
worked.
it
does
not
only
stopped
the
previous
spiral
of
prices
which
the
court
is
aware
of,
but
its
resulted
in
the
last
seven
years,
in
price
reductions
below
contract
levels
which
for
the
seven-year
period
have
aggregated
about
$134
million.
and
i
want
to
say
that
there're
another
$20
million
in
refunds
which
will
ride
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
another
series
of
cases
to
be
heard
later
this
term.
the
petition
--
the
commission's
1960
phillips
decision
decided
that
we
were
going
to
regulate
by
area
rates,
but
i'm
afraid,
it's
fair
to
say,
a
very
little
else.
accordingly,
when
the
commission
instituted
the
permian
proceeding
which
it
did
roughly
two
months
thereafter,
that
on
december
23rd,
1960,
there
were
virtually
no
guidelines
as
to
how
the
parties
to
--
should
proceed,
or
for
that
matter,
what
the
commission's
real
intent
was.
i
very
strongly
suspect
that
this
uncertainty
together
with
certain
language
in
the
phillips
decision
itself
which
could
be
read
as
indicating
that
the
commission
would
drop
consideration
of
costs
and
rely
largely
on
unregulated
field
prices
was
responsible
for
the
unhappiness
of
the
consumer
interest
such
as
the
state
of
california,
who
unsuccessfully
challenged
the
phillips
decision
in
this
court.
but
as
i
will
show,
that
if
this
was
what
they
were
afraid
of,
their
fears
have
not
--
their
fears
were
unwarranted.
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court
in
evaluating
the
commission's
end
product
here.
if
i
briefly
outline
the
procedure
the
commission
followed
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
order
of
december
23rd,
1960
named
about
330
producing
parties
who
were
--
had
filed
rates
on
file
in
the
permian
area
as
respondents.
and
in
addition,
about
47
other
parties,
some
big
and
some
small,
were
allowed
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
that
the
commission
held
a
prehearing
conference
in
midland,
texas
in
march
1961,
to
try
and
workout
with
the
party
some
way
of
proceeding.
but
again,
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
very
little
was
accomplished
here,
except
what
i
guess
was
important,
a
recognition
that
there
wasn't
any
real
agreement
as
to
how
area
rates
should
be
established.
the
one
thing
that
did
come
out
of
this
proceeding
in
subsequent
discussions
among
the
parties
was
agreement
that
there
should
be
a
cost
questionnaire
developed
by
the
commission
staff
with
the
assistance
of
the
industry.
and
since
it
was
recognized
that
the
preparation
and
the
filling
out
and
compilation
of
this
cost
questionnaire
was
going
to
take
time,
it
was
decided
that
they
would
--
we
would
split
up
of
the
hearing
and
we
would
start
the
hearing
with
general
evidence
on
the
economic
phases
of
the
industry.
now,
this
economic
phase
in
the
--
of
the
hearing
were
important
phase
of
the
hearing,
started
in
october
of
1961.
it
started
essentially
with
producer
testimony.
they
stressed
as
one
would
expect
the
alleged
existence
of
a
free
and
competitive
market
for
the
sale
of
gas
from
producers
to
pipelines.
and
the
more
--
they
need
to
encourage
gas
exploration
and
development
to
meet
the
ever
increasing
demands
for
gas.
the
producers
in
effect
asserted
that
the
only
way
the
country
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
enough
gas
to
meet
these
increasing
needs
was
by
substantial
price
encouragement
to
the
producing
industry
to
go
out
and
explore
for
and
develop
new
gas
fields.
and
this
they
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
permian
basin
would
necessitate
a
ceiling
price
of
about
20
cents
which
was
roughly
about
4
cents
higher
than
the
going
price
for
gas
in
permian
at
that
time.
now,
in
the
course
of
this
presentation,
the
producers
presented
some
very
significant
and
fairly
unique
as
of
that
time
evidence
that
the
production
industry
which
formulate
had
been
very
much
tied
together
between
the
exploration
and
development
of
oil
and
gas,
was
that
they
were
locked
together
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
that
the
production
industry
as
of
about
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
this
case,
you
can't
fix
a
definite
date,
some
people
got
this,
what
i'm
about
to
say
earlier,
others
who
were
getting
it
at
the
time.
but
roughly
about
this
1960
period,
the
production
industry
had
developed
the
ability
and
capacity
to
explore
and
drill
directly
for
gas
reserves
as
contrasted
with
oil
reserves.
now,
the
importance
of
this
is
perfectly
clear.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
important
to
the
basic
argument
being
made
by
the
producers,
because
as
long
as
gas
is
merely
a
byproduct
of
oil,
the
argument
that
you
need
very
high
prices
to
induce
gas
exploration
obviously
is
not
a
very
good
one.
but
if
now
for
the
first
time,
you
could
really
explore
for
gas
individually,
and
if
you
could
decide
where
you're
going
to
put
your
money,
that
price
arguably
became
significant.
the
producers
put
forward
this
directional
argument
as
a
contention
that
there
should
be
a
general
increase
in
prices
or
at
least
a
high
ceiling
applicable
to
all
gas.
they
did
this
despite
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
the
gas,
flowing
gas,
was
oil-well
gas
or
what
in
this
standpoint
is
the
same
thing,
residue
gas
produced
from
oil-well
gas.
let
me
--
maybe
i
be
better
to
find
some
terms
that
i'll
be
throwing
around
here.
by
gas-well
gas,
we're
talking
about
dry
gas,
gas
which
more
or
less
is
not
connected
with
oil.
it's
about
--
it
comes
out
of
reservoirs
which
are
not
oil
reservoirs.
as
we'll
get
into
in
a
few
minutes,
there's
a
serious
problem
here
too
because
gas-well
gas
or
at
least
most
gas-well
gas
does
have
some
heavy
hydrocarbons
condensate
which
are
liquefiable
and
which
not
only
are
liquefiable
but
which
are
probably
more
valuable
economically
if
they
are
liquefied.
so
we
still
have
the
condensate
liquid
problems
to
deal
with.
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
proportion
of
gas-well
gas
is
increasing.
in
permian
basin,
there
was
at
the
time
of
this
decision
still
roughly
two-thirds
oil-well
gas.
the
permian
basin
essentially
started
out
as
being
one
of
the
big
oil
reservoirs
of
west
texas.
but
even
in
permian
basin,
the
gas-well
percentage
is
increasing
nationally.
it
is
i
think,
almost
up
to
50%
or
maybe
higher
are
--
well,
66%
nationally
now.
and
i
think
everybody
in
this
room
recognizes
and
believes
that
the
future
here
lies
with
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
two-thirds
of
it
nationally
–-
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
is
now
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
you
can't
talk
that
way.
the
original
gas
discoveries
in
kansas
or
the
thing
which
probably
more
than
anything
else
started
the
natural
gas
industry
is
the
pipeline
industry
was
gas-well
gas.
then
you've
got
a
lot
of
this
oil-well
gas
in
the
big
developments
in
texas,
then
in
northern
louisiana,
and
now
the
offshore
gas.
a
lot
of
the
offshore
gas
which
certainly
bring
major
gas
is
coming
in
as
gas-well
gas.
it's
exceedingly
rich
and
condensate.
so
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
natural
gas
industry,
but
it's
not
oil.
well,
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
--
this
directional
hypothesis
were
put
forward
as
a
general
claim
for
a
price
increase,
even
though
most
of
the
gas
in
permian
to
be
priced
was
oil-well
gas
or
residue
derived
from
the
oil
ones.
and
even
though
all
of
the
flowing
gas
or
practically
all
of
the
flowing
gas
had
been
developed
prior
to
the
time
in
which
there
was
any
significant
directional
search.
now,
the
reason
for
this
of
course
and
maybe
i
should
mention
this
again
because
another
basic
fact
is
distinguished
with
this
industry
from
certain
others,
is
that
gas
is
sold
on
20-year
contracts.
actually,
these
contracts
after
they
expire
they
tend
to
be
even
further
selling,
gasses
sold
now
which
was
developed
15
to
20
years
ago.
and
the
flowing
gas
of
1960
isn't
gas
that
was
developed
in
1960.
now,
based
on
the
facts
that
i
just
mentioned
and
the
recognition
that
gas-well
gas
is
the
need
for
the
future,
the
distributors
in
their
economic
presentation
put
forward
to
the
commission
a
basic
new
approach
to
the
whole
subject
of
gas
pricing.
they
relied
largely
on
policy
testimony
by
dr.
alfred
kahn,
the
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
cornell
university,
has
developed
a
more
concrete
terms
by
his
economists
statistician,
what
have
you,
colleagues
of
a
private
organization
going
under
a
rather
fancy
name
of
the
national
economic
research
associates.
i
would
-–
i
should
give
any
impression
that
this
is
a
governmental
body.
and
the
distributors
working
through
these
people
developed
what
has
been
known
as
the
two-price
system,
which
the
commission
eventually
adopted.
they
started
from
the
premise
and
that
there
is
a
finite
and
discernible
cost
for
the
separate
search
development
and
production
of
gas
as
distinguished
from
oil.
and
dr.
kahn
proposed
that
if
this
is
the
case,
that
the
new
gas-well
gas,
the
gas
of
the
future,
the
gas
which
was
going
to
be
responsive
to
price
and
was
the
gas
that
needed
to
adduced,
should
be
separately
priced
from
the
old
stuff
and
should
be
priced
not
on
historical
cost
concepts
but
price
on
the
basis
of
its
own
current
cost
for
this
search
and
discovery
of
gas,
this
of
course
would
achieve
a
number
of
basic
advantages.
afar
from
the
least
is
that
it
would
eliminate
in
this
basic
pricing
determination
many
of
the
more
difficult
allocation
problems
which
have
driven
us
all
mad
in
this
case
of
trying
to
determine
what
the
joint
cost
of
oil
and
gas
should
be
when
they
are
joint
product
that
people
aren't
--
are
really
operating
one
better
than
the
other.
and
i
said,
there
are
still
all
these
all
problems
of
condensate
but
at
least
you
got
rid
of
the
--
the
oil
part
of
it.
in
addition
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
are
similar
but
they're
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what,
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
we
don't
think
so.
and
if
you
look
at
the
decision,
you'll
see
for
example
that
in
this
new
gas-well
pricing,
instead
of
making
an
allocation
of
embedded
cost,
what
the
commission
was
able
to
do
using
the
information
supplied
in
the
record
by
both
producers
and
distributors
in
picking
and
choosing
the
proper
ones,
was
to
price
the
gas
and
have
priced
the
operation
which
leads
to
gas
and
have
a
condensate
liquid
credit
based
upon
the
value,
and
on
regulated
liquid
business
and
simply
determine
that
the
liquid
credit
which
is
what
these
people
are
getting
from
liquids
is
the
part
of
the
cost
which
can
be
subtracted
from
gas,
and
to
a
large
extent,
avoid
these
allocations.
now,
we
do
have
some,
i
don't
want
to
oversell
this,
like
most
things,
this
is
a
matter
of
degree.
but
if
you
will
read
the
very
good
discussion
on
this
in
the
commission
decision
and
the
examiner's
decision,
you'll
see
that
the
very
great
advantages
and
improvements
were
made
on
this
issue.
the
other
point
i'm
trying
to
make
and
certainly
equally
important
is
that
by
this
two-price
system
based
on
a
current
cost
for
gas,
we
are
able
to
adjust
prospectively
gas
prices
as
conditions
in
the
cost
or
otherwise
required
without
automatically
raising
the
price
on
oil
as
other
flowing
gas
and
giving
windfalls
to
people
who
produce
gas
under
very
different
conditions.
this
is
not
important
in
terms
of
the
permian
decision
that
we
have
here
before
us.
this
math
that
we
could
fix
and
did
fix
a
cost
based
price
for
new
pipeline
gas
of
$16
and
a
half
cents
without
affording
the
2
cent
windfall
which
would
have
resulted
if
we
priced
flowing
gas
at
this
price
which
on
historical
basis
came
out
to
$14
and
a
half
cents.
now
of
course,
you
could
have
done
it
another
way,
you
could
have
combine
these
prices
and
come
out
with
something
in
between.
but
if
you
would
have
done
that,
maybe
you
would
have
avoided
the
windfall
to
a
certain
extent
if
not
completely.
but
you
wouldn't
have
had
as
higher
price
for
the
new
development
and
search
as
the
commission
found
was
the
appropriate
price
if
you're
going
to
induce
enough
gas.
let
me
take
sometime
here,
it's
a
useful
thing
to
do,
to
discuss
some
of
the
arguments
against
this
two-price
system.
nobody
was
bored
originally
except
the
distributors,
the
staff
of
the
commission
and
the
staff
of
the
california
commission
argued
that
this
was
all
very
well
in
theory
but
there
really
hadn't
been
much
of
the
demonstration
that
this
directional
search
had
been
put
into
effect
as
yet.
and
they
said
that
under
these
circumstances
the
historical
method
was
appropriate,
particularly
since
the
evidence
indicated
that
there
were
not
any
great
price
up
trends
in
cost
since
about
1958.
the
commission
disagreed
with
this
and
concluded
that
the
evidence
did
show
that
there
was
a
real
increasing
directional
ability
here
and
that
it
would
agree
with
the
producer
and
distributor
evidence
on
this
point.
and
this
of
course
required
the
rejection
of
the
two
staff's
argument.
it
also
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
i'm
sorry
to
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
rejection
of
the
argument
against
the
directionality.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
one
of
the
interesting
things
as
i
will
bring
out
in
this
argument
is
the
relative
silence
of
the
pipelines.
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
distributors
are
primarily
a
group
of
the
distributors
of
gas
in
california,
pacific
gas
&
electric,
pacific
lighting
companies,
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
the
people
who
are
selling
gas
on
the
firing
line,
one
of
the
more
interesting
factors
in
this
case
is
the
pipelines
are
much
less
interested
in
this
price
for
their
own
gas
even
though
its
one
of
the
major
components
of
the
costs.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
even
though
the
cost
of
purchased
gas
is
one
the
major
components
in
a
pipeline's
cost,
the
people
who
are
interested
in
price
here
and
the
people
who
are
arguing
that
the
price
should
come
down
and
knots
go
up,
the
people
who
were
fighting
this
case
from
a
consumer's
standpoint
outside
of
the
commission
and
outside
of
the
california
commission,
were
the
distributors,
not
the
pipelines.
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
this
which
i
will
get
into.
the
rejection
upon
the
acceptance
of
directional
capability
did
unfortunately
require
of
the
rejection
by
the
commission
of
a
major
pioneering
effort
by
the
staff.
our
chief
economist,
dr.
harold
warren
had
developed
and
put
into
evidence
an
econometric
study
attempting
to
relate
supply
and
demand
in
this
industry.
his
study
had
not
taken
into
account
directionality
and
the
commission
felt
that
as
a
result
of
this,
that
it
was
necessary
to
--
they
couldn't
rely
on
it.
the
commission
noted
with
respect
to
this
study
as
well
as
certain
other
imperfect
pricing
techniques
which
had
been
put
forward
here,
it's
hoped
that
future
developers
might
make
their
use
possible
in
subsequent
proceedings,
because
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
we're
convinced
that
this
present
area
rate
decision
is
a
good
one.
fully
meeting
the
end
requirement
task
of
the
hope
--
but
we
don't
suggest
it's
the
final
word
and
we
know
that
we're
going
to
develop
further
insight
into
this
problem
with
experience
in
the
other
cases
and
with
experience
in
our
future
review.
the
producer
argument
of
the
gas
two-price
system,
was
of
course
that
they
should
--
as
i
said,
that
they
should
get
the
higher
price
for
all
of
their
gas.
and
it's
most
unsophisticated
level
that
the
argument
is
gas
is
gas.
and
the
consumer,
the
pipeline,
can't
tell
whether
a
molecule
was
old
gas
or
new
gas,
but
therefore,
even
if
the
old
gas
had
been
developed
as
a
pure
byproduct
of
the
search
for
oil,
it
should
have
the
same
price.
we
don't
think
this
is
a
really
a
good
argument.
this
is
the
same
type
of
argument
that
got
this
industry
into
trouble
though
the
indefinite
escalation
clauses
whereby
everybody
in
the
industry
would
always
get
the
highest
price
that
was
being
charged
at
a
later
date.
now
you
can
--
just
as
well
say
money
is
money
which
of
course
it
is,
but
that
doesn't
mean
--
because
money
is
money,
that
where
interest
rates
on
a
mortgage
--
mortgages
go
up,
that
the
interest
rates
on
old
--
the
old
mortgages
go
up
as
well.
the
fact
is
that
gas
maybe
gas
molecularly
but
the
value
of
gas
and
the
cost
of
gas
at
different
times
and
on
different
circumstance
are
not
the
same
thing.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
think
it's
somebody
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
understand
your
question.
i'm
not
an
engineer.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
engineering
question
so
much
as
a
geological
question,
various
techniques
of
seismograph
and
other
things.
we
are
just
better
equipped
to
judge
on
the
basis
of
what
we
know
before.
whether
if
you
drill
at
this
particular
spot
to
a
given
level,
that
you're
more
likely
to
hit
a
gas
reservoir
as
contrasted
with
an
oil
reservoir.
now,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
absolute.
somebody
drills
right
under
this
building,
you
probably
won't
hit
anything,
but
there
are
obviously
be
no
basis
to
determine
whether
this
is
going
to
be
oil
or
gas
if
they
hit
something.
this
is
a
basis
of
accumulated
experience.
but
it
is
pretty
well
established
now
that
this
industry
does
what
inland
--
know
what
it's
going
to
search
for
when
it's
searching.
the
other
contention
against
the
two-price
system
is
that
a
one
price
high
price
should
be
allowed
for
all
gas
because
revenues
from
gas
have
been
the
primary
source
for
reinvestment.
but
as
the
commission
pointed
out
the
allowances
in
the
old
gas
price
here,
in
over
beyond
out-of-pocket
cost,
the
allowances
for
exploration
and
development
in
dd&a
depreciation,
depletion
and
what's
that?
i
forgot.
in
return,
will
all
provide
more
than
adequate
revenues
for
reinvestment
if
the
price
is
right.
if
the
price
for
new
gas
isn't
right,
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
money
you
give
for
old
gas,
they'll
simply
put
their
money
on
other
places.
moreover,
the
producer
just
aren't
restricted
to
old
gas
revenues,
they
have
plenty
of
revenues
from
other
sources
which
they'll
put
into
gas
if
the
price
is
right.
and
they
have
accessed
to
equity
and
debt.
in
short,
gas
exploration
and
development
will
continue
as
long
as
there's
a
profitable
market
for
natural
gas
and
won't
continue
if
there
isn't.
the
choice
of
the
two-price
system
resulted
in
another
problem
for
the
commission
and
that
is
the
evidentiary
problem.
as
i
indicated,
we
had
agreed
to
prepare
and
did
prepare
with
the
cooperation
of
the
producers
and
the
distributors
and
the
clients,
a
detailed
cost
questionnaire.
the
data
from
this
cost
questionnaire
is
very
useful,
subsequently
used
as
the
basic
method
of
fixing
the
price
for
old
flowing
gas.
it
was
also
used
to
a
very
great
extent
for
new
gas
but
it
was
not
adequate
to
this
task.
it
was
not
adequate
to
this
task
because
it
had
been
geared
at
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
to
a
conventional
historical
cost
approach
and
there
was
a
lot
of
information
which
would
need
it
if
you're
going
to
get
a
current
cost
for
gas
discovery
which
was
just
not
in
this
cost
questionnaire.
now
this
presented
a
problem
but
it
was
not
an
insoluble
problem
and
the
breach
was
filled
and
testimony
by
both
producers
and
distributors,
by
a
careful
selection
by
expert
witnesses
of
information
taken
from
a
variety
of
sources
to
supplement
the
cost
information.
these
sources
range
from
the
united
states
census
of
mineral
industries,
to
a
chase
manhattan
bank
gas
survey,
to
information
developed
on
a
regular
basis
by
the
american
gas
association,
the
american
petroleum
institute,
to
trade
publications
such
as
the
oil
&
gas
journal
and
the
world
oil
magazine.
the
witnesses
were
on
an
agreement
generally
as
to
what
they
were
looking
for
by
way
of
information.
they
disagreed
as
to
what
was
the
better
source
when
there
were
one
or
more
source
to
be
picked
from
and
exactly
how
the
matter
would
be
derived
from
these
sources.
but
their
individual
expositions
on
this
matter
were
subject
to
most
extensive
and
thorough
cross-examination
and
most
careful
and
detailed
analysis
by,
first,
the
examiner,
and
second
by
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
the
information
collected
in
the
questionnaire
was
both
national
and
permian.
and
the
information
that
i'm
talking
about
now
is
the
broader
information,
was
in
some
respect
only
matched
as
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
only
matched,
so
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
decided
for
the
reasons
that
they
explained
in
some
detail
that
the
new
gas-well
gas
price
would
be
based
on
national
data
or
as
part
of
a
new
discovery
for
the
future
generally.
the
commission
also
decided
and
utilized
for
permian
figures
which
are
more
directly
related
to
permian.
but
even
there,
they
picked
and
chose
and
when
they
got
to
a
matter
like
exploration
and
development
expenses
for
dry
holes
for
the
non-product
of
the
search,
they
used
--
as
everybody
agreed,
they
had
to
--
national
figures.
the
commission
also
faced
up
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
justification
or
not
in
new
gas-well
price
for
separate
deviations
for
this
national
law
for
permian
cited
there
was
not,
this
has
not
been
shown
on
this
record.
these
selections
were
by
no
means
one
way.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
costing
is
largely
based
from
the
evidence
of
dr.
roseman
(ph)
who
was
a
witness
for
the
distributors,
but
there
are
situations
in
which
the
commission
found
he
was
too
low.
there
are
other
situations
where
they
found
he
was
too
high.
there
areas
where
they
picked
other
testimony
which
they
thought
better
reflected
the
true
fact.
this
picking
and
choosing
of
statistical
information
of
the
pipe
i'm
talking
about
has
been
criticized
in
the
briefs
here
primarily
by
the
sun
oil
company
as
being
outrageous
attempt
to
get
away
from
anything
which
is
real
in
the
way
of
cost.
it's
surprising
since
sun
or
the
other
producers
were
violently
against
the
effort
by
the
california
commission
to
adopt
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
but
actually
sun
was
right
and
california
was
wrong.
because
any
efforts
to
adopt
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
which
give
the
–
which
–
we'd
had
one.
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding,
it
would
have
almost
certainly
not
proved
adequate
to
the
past
because
this
whole
directional
idea
and
lot
of
the
other
developments
here
were
things
which
grew
up
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
we
picked
and
used
on
a
thoroughly
analyzed
basis,
good
statistical
sources
by
no
means
skew
against
the
industry.
we
analyzed
them
to
the
best
of
our
ability
and
the
argument
that
we
should
have
waited
until
there
could
be
agreement
as
to
a
uniform
system
of
accounting
and
statistical
information.
and
then
developed
area
rate
making
is
of
course
only
an
argument
that
we
should
postpone,
area
rate
making
in
depth,
the
commission
was
not
willing
to
do
this.
sun
is
also
challenged
and
maybe
it's
a
good
point
to
mention
this,
the
data
we
used
in
pricing
old
gas-well
gas,
the
flowing
gas,
now
here
the
information
from
the
cost
questionnaire
which
we
had
agreed
with
in
various
parties
was
available
and
usable.
and
it
was
used
as
the
basic
way
of
pricing
the
old
gas-well
gas.
it
was,
however,
and
i
think
this
is
not
unimportant,
wasn't
just
on
that
way.
the
examiner
has
suggested
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
technique
of
trending
back
the
new
gas-well
prices
that
he
had
found
on
basis
of
cost
trends
over
a
period
of
years
to
get
the
old
gas-well
gas.
and
the
commission
used
this
technique
as
a
check
against
its
historical
cost
and
technique
and
came
out
with
a
quite
comparable
figure
of
the
old
gas-well
cost
on
a
historical
basis
with
about
14.39
or
37.
on
the
trend
back,
it
was
14.67
or
something
like
that
and
the
commission
felt
that
this
was
a
reasonable
check
on
its
figure
which
had
grounded
off
to
14
and
a
half.
now,
sun
objects
to
the
appendix
b
form
which
was
the
basic
form,
cost
form,
which
were
used
for
this
old
gas-well
gas
because
it
says
it's
unrepresented.
in
fact,
this
appendix
b
form
includes
the
cost
for
the
producers
who
in
permian
account
for
85%
of
the
gas-well
gas.
sun
knew
that
the
figure
of
15%
on
some
place
or
other
achieves
this
figure
of
15%
by
simply
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
commission,
to
avoid
the
worst
of
these
allocation
problems,
justice
stewart,
shows
not
to
price
oil-well
gas,
flowing
oil-well
gas
at
all,
but
instead
priced
gas-well
gas
and
fixed
the
price
of
oil-well
gas
on
a
value
basis
at
the
same
level.
it
also
gets
this
low
figure
by
of
course
of
the
commission
in
another
similar
effort.
it
didn't
use
the
figures
which
we
had
on
the
record,
in
which
of
anything.
it
gives
a
slightly
lower
price
relating
to
so-called
combination
of
oil
and
gas
leases.
again,
we
avoided
using
these
figure
because
it
involved
an
allocation
between
oil
and
gas
which
we
thought
would
produce
a
result
less
true
than
if
we
didn't
used
these
figures
at
all
and
used
the
other
mass
of
material
we
had.
the
only
real
question
as
far
as
the
use
of
the
questionnaire
information
is
concerned,
as
i
said,
is
with
respect
to
small
producers
and
whether
these
costs
are
representative
of
the
cost
of
small
producers.
now
here
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
old
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
what
i
said
was
that
the
old
gas-well
gas
was
fixed
primarily
on
the
historical
cost
from
the
cost
questionnaire,
checked
out
against
this
back
trending.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
fixed
the
price
for
gas-well
gas.
we
did
not
fix
a
cost
for
oil-well
gas
or
residue
gas.
we
decided
that
the
costing
of
oil-well
gas
or
residue
gas
because
of
the
additional
allocation
problems
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
which
would
lead
to
horrible
fights
--
large
amounts
of
money
which
allocation
we'd
picked,
would
not
get
any
meaningful
figure
and
instead
we
said
that
this
gas
has
the
value
in
the
marketplace
as
the
marketplace
in
this
year
showed
of
the
gas-well
gas,
the
old
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
we
will
give
them
that
price.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
have,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oil-well
gas
was
valued
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
knew
how
to
speak
briefly
about
the
small
producer
problem.
the
small
producers,
has
a
real
problem
on
information.
they
just
don't
maintain
the
type
of
books
upon
which
you
can
get
any
meaningful
information.
the
commission
tried
to
handle
this
by
providing
for
a
simplified
appendix
c
questionnaire
which
was
optional
for
small
producers
under
10
million
mcf
a
year
and
it
didn't
work
very
well.
of
about
285
small
producers
in
this
area,
25
of
them
chose
to
respond
on
appendix
b.
that's
the
main
one.
a
130
responded
on
appendix
c,
but
of
that
information,
only
60
of
them
had
anything
which
you
could
even
use
for
compositing
the
factors.
it's
true
and
an
argument
is
made
here
that
the
composite
cost
of
the
60
small
producers
who
did
submit
usable
material
on
appendix
c,
are
somewhat
higher
than
the
appendix
b
clause
which
we
used
for
old
gas-well
gas.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
25
small
producers
who
filed
on
appendix
b
who
went
about
as
much
gas
as
the
60
will
file
on
appendix
c,
it's
slightly
lower
cost
than
the
major
producers.
casting
real
doubt
upon
whether
these
higher
costs
on
appendix
c
were
really
meaningful,
and
moreover,
if
we
had
included
these
appendix
c
clause
in
our
old
gas-well
gas,
which
we
did
not,
the
total
effect
would
have
been
roughly
--
well,
it's
less
than
a
mill,
seven-tenths
of
a
mill
on
the
entire
business.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
we
--
in
our
decision
here,
as
the
result
of
this
ignored
small
producer
problems.
there
isn't
any
evidence
as
far
as
i
know
that
small
producers
really
have
lower
cost
on
the
overall
basis.
there
is
some
evidence
that
some
other
costs
are
lower
such
as
drilling
companies.
there
are
also
evidence
offsetting
this
that
some
of
their
cost
--
pardon
me,
some
of
their
costs
are
higher
really,
also
evidence
that
some
of
their
costs
are
lower.
they
used
the
geophysical
and
geological
and
lease
work
of
the
majors
in
the
like
piggyback
ride.
but
what's
more
important,
even
if
the
smaller
producers
as
a
class
did
have
demonstrably
higher
cost
which
they
don't,
it
wouldn't
materially
aid
them
to
set
a
separate
higher
price
for
their
gas.
the
reason
for
this
is
clear,
even
assuming
that
you
could
establish
different
prices
for
the
same
type
of
gas,
nearly
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
the
company.
the
pipelines
would
not
and
should
not
buy
gas
for
more
money
when
there's
gas
for
less
money
available
in
the
same
area.
and
the
small
producers
recognized
this
dilemma.
they
have
not
sought
a
higher
separate
price
for
themselves
and
they
have
not
even
asked
for
exemption
entirely
from
area
rates
as
various
people
including
justice
clark
of
this
court
has
suggested
from
time
to
time.
instead,
what
they
were
asking
is
that
the
highest
possible
price
for
all
gas
so
that
they
can
ride
along.
a
perfectly
reasonable
eye
concept
to
what
the
real
marketplace
is
here,
the
commission
was
understandably,
unwillingness
--
unwilling
to
raise
overall
prices
on
this
unproven
claims
of
the
small
producers.
but
they
have
done
two
important
things
for
smaller
producers.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
established
a
small
producer
certificate
system
which
allows
the
producer
to
get
out
of
the
administrative
burdens
which
are
much
more
real
for
them
than
for
the
big
company
of
continually
filing
with
our
commission.
now
they
can
get
one
certificate
which
is
good
for
all
of
their
sales
and
they
can
file
up
for
increase
as
their
contracts
permit
up
to
the
ceiling,
as
we've
said
here
without
bothering
to
come
to
us
with
rate
claims.
the
second
place,
we
have,
because
we
found
it
was
not
worth
the
price
to
do
otherwise
but
also
because
it
would
benefit
them,
relieve
them
from
observing
the
quality
differentials
that
the
commission
established
on
major
permission.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
problem
that
i
--
that
you
asked
before
justice
stewart.
this
quality
question
presented
another
major
problem
for
the
commission
acquiring
innovation
of
some
sort
or
another
from
itself
is
very
simple.
particularly
in
permian,
considerable
percentage
of
the
gas
which
the
pipeline
buy,
more
important,
not
what
they
buy,
considerable
percentage
of
the
gas
as
it
comes
to
the
pipeline
is
not
of
pipeline
quality
and
has
to
be
processed
by
the
pipelines
at
considerable
expense
for
them
and
their
consumers.
there
are
a
number
of
kinds
of
this
deficiency
which
were
set
out
in
the
record,
high
sulfur,
too
much
water,
too
little
pressure,
and
particular
nasty
thing
in
the
permian
basin,
other
gas
comes
out
with
a
lot
of
co2.
and
whereas
the
petroleum
industry
has
shown
tremendous
ability
to
make
use
of
all
sorts
of
wastes
and
byproducts,
so
far,
at
least
on
this
record,
they
haven't
figured
out
what
to
do
with
co2.
this
may
come
yet,
but
it
hasn't
come
out.
and
there's
additional
problem
and
that's
the
btu
problem.
btu
is
the
heating
content
of
the
gas.
i
think
its
british
thermal
units.
gas
as
it
comes
out
of
the
round,
depending
on
its
molecular
structure
is
of
this
different
heating
value.
the
btu
problem
will
come
back
to
as
a
little
different
than
these
others
because
it
goes
both
up
and
down.
now,
the
producer
said,
don't
worry
about
the
quality
problem,
you
can
depend
on
the
pipelines
to
bargain
this
down
from
any
ceiling
rates
you
set
for
bad
quality
gas.
and
it
certainly
is
evidenced
that
the
pipelines
in
certain
areas
have
paid
less
for
low
pressure
gas
which
they
had
to
compress
to
bring
up
to
the
level.
but
there's
also
evidence
that
this
is
far
from
the
perfect
system
and
the
commission
was
unwilling
to
do
this
while
a
lot
of
gas
which
has
a
low
quality
get
the
ceiling
because
there
hadn't
been
such
provisions
and
contracts
and
allow
a
higher
in
effect
ceilings
for
bargaining
in
the
future.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
treat
the
risk,
a
very
real
risk
in
the
permian
basin,
of
finding
and
developing
gas
of
less
than
pipeline
quality.
as
one
of
the
major
elements
which
it
relied
upon
in
fixing
the
12%
rate
of
return
which
fixed
not
for
average
quality
gas
but
as
the
return
for
finding
pipeline
quality
gas.
in
other
words,
it
said,
essentially
the
risk
of
finding
low
quality
gas
is
analogist
to
the
risk
of
finding
no
gas
or
the
risk
of
finding
gas
in
insufficient
quantities.
and
we
will
consider
it
as
one
of
the
major
elements
in
determining
on
a
12%
rate
of
return
on
investment
here.
the
court
of
appeals
in
one
stage
of
its
opinion
seems
to
have
thought
this
was
wrong,
that
the
--
rather
being
treated
as
risk,
we
should
treat
as
a
producer
cost.
we
don't
understand
this
because
obviously
this
is
not
a
producer
cost,
bad
gas
cost
of
producer,
no
more
and
no
less
than
good
gas.
and
the
gas
we're
talking
about,
the
processing
cost
we're
talking
about
here
are
the
cost
which
the
pipelines
have
to
pay.
there
is
producer
of
processing
gas.
of
course,
there's
producer
processing
of
gas
in
permian,
but
where
the
producers
process
the
gas
in
permian
and
then
sell
it,
they
get
the
pipeline
quality
ceiling
price
but
without
any
discount.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
technique
the
commission
adopted
for
handling
this
difficult
quality
problem
is
necessarily
the
only
one.
the
examiner
equally
innovating
had
a
different
one
in
which
he
fixed
the
price
for
average
gas
and
then
had
a
--
what
you
call
a
gold
standard,
above
that
where
higher
quality
gas
and
a
compression
technique
for
lower
quality
gas.
and
the
--
whereas
this
is
far
from
--
perfected
in
the
examiner's
opinion,
this
a
possible
approach
to
the
problem
also.
we
adduce
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
sour
means
too
much
salt.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
it's
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
not
peculiar
to
oil-well
gas.
i
am
sure,
but
i
have
not
the
confidence
to
tell
you
what,
that
some
of
these
deficiencies
are
more
likely
in
some
areas
than
other,
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
sure
there's
a
correlation,
but
there
are
deficiencies
and
sometimes
major
deficiencies
with
gas-well
gas
as
well
as
oil-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
different
magnitude,
different
degree,
that's
right.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
commission
decided
that
rather
than
a
general
reduction,
it
would
have
the
quality
of
each
individual
sale
determined
on
the
basis
of
relationships
between
--
agreements
between
the
pipeline
sellers
as
to
what
the
actual
cost
of
bringing
this
gas
is
up
to
pipeline
quality.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
costs
we're
talking
about
are
borne
by
the
pipelines.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
sure!
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
sure!
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
a
processing
plant
which
is
owned
by
the
producers
will
--
as
well
as
extracting
higher
btus,
usually
raise
the
quality
of
the
gas,
and
to
the
extent
of
the
producer
raises
the
quality
of
the
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
gets
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
he
gets
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
gets
the
higher
price
–-
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
well,
it
is
the
return
which
was
allowed
in
fixing
a
ceiling.
all
producers
won't
get
it,
some
will
get
more
and
some
will
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
get
it
less.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
one
of
the
factors
the
commission
mentioned
was
the
small
producers
in
fixing
a
return
as
high
as
12%.
but
it
was
not
specially
calibrated
to
the
small
producers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
85%
of
the
gas-well
gas
in
permian
was
produced
by
the
large
producers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
far
from
it.
this
was
one
of
the
minor
factors
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
that
was
taken
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
into
account.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
is
normal
in
rate
of
return
determinations,
the
commission
considered
lots
of
factors.
it
considered
notably
minor
factor
but
did
mention
the
small
producer
problem.
it
considered
as
a
major
factor
the
quality
problem.
it
considered
the
risk
of
finding
anything.
it
compared
the
risk
of
this
industry
with
the
pipeline
branch
of
it.
it
considered,
as
this
court
have
said,
it
must
consider
in
the
hope
case
and
other
cases,
what
comparable
industries
were
secured
so
that
it
–
you
make
sure
that
there'd
be
enough
of
an
investment
inducement
here
for
people
to
invest
in
this
industry.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly.
well,
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
on
this
quality
problem
at
this
point
because
i'll
get
back
to
it
a
little
later
is
that
the
idea
the
we
didn't
know
the
--
we
couldn't
quantify
it,
is
not
right
and
commission,
for
reasons
which
i'll
get
into
a
little
later
expressly
found
that
the
range
of
quantification
of
this
quality
business
was
going
to
be
between
about
seven
tenths
of
a
cent,
one
and
half
cent.
this
is
based
on
evidence
in
the
record.
we've
been
accused
of
supporting
this
by
post
record
filings
of
these
quality
statements
of
the
actual
amounts.
each
individual
sale
is
going
to
have
--
deducted
from
it.
now,
this
isn't
true.
then,
we
have
referred
to
these
filings
which
support
the
commission's
judgment
based
on
the
record
of
what
the
extent
of
the
quality
differential
would
be
because
it
does
show
we
were
right
and
because
we
know
that
if
the
specific
quality
statements
have
shown
that
we
were
wrong
by
2
or
3
cents
and
that
this
was
a
much
more
serious
problem
that
the
commission
had
counted
on
in
fixing
the
rate
of
return,
that
the
producers
quite
properly
would
be
back
here
saying,
“you
have
to
remand
it,
you've
made
a
serious
mistake
even
if
there
was
a
basis
for
you're
making”.
let
me
say
a
quick
word
about
the
btu
problem.
this
is
heating
content,
and
here
you
can
have
very
low
btu
and
very
high
btu
and
this
is
not
only
a
natural
phenomena,
but
much
more
important,
it
is
feasible
and
economic
for
pipelines
unless
there's
--
for
producers
unless
there's
a
good
reason
to
the
contrary
to
extract
the
high
btu's
which
can
be
converted
into
bottled
gas
and
sold
as
propane
and
butane.
now,
traditionally
in
this
area,
there
has
been
a
downward
btu
adjustment
starting
at
1000
btu
per
cubic
foot
and
the
commission
adopted
that
in
its
opinion.
traditionally,
there
has
been
no
upward
btu
adjustment
in
this
area,
but
traditionally,
the
average
value
of
btu
value
of
the
gas
sold
was
about
1042
btu
at
least,
this
were
the
best
statistics
we
could
get
on.
and
this
is
not
insignificant
because
particularly
in
this
area,
the
pipelines
sell
to
the
california
distributors
on
a
thermal
basis,
high
btu
gas,
they
don't
just
extract
it
for
their
own
operations.
the
commission
felt
that
significant
and
important
here
to
provide
an
inducement
to
the
producer
not
to
extract
the
high
btu's
before
it
got
to
the
pipeline.
and
they
provided
for
the
first
time,
unique
in
this
area
for
upward
btu.
they
set
the
upward
btu
in
a
1050,
an
approximation
of
the
average
btu
in
the
area.
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
--
if
they
were
going
to
give
a
bonus
or
no
bonus
was
ever
before
been
given,
they
weren't
going
to
give
a
bonus
for
people
giving
less
valuable
gas
than
they
have
been
supplying
without
a
bonus.
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
understand
this
gap
of
figure
that
we
had
to
--
apparently
a
figure
that
if
we're
going
to
have
a
btu
adjustment
half
a
start
downward
or
an
upward
from
the
same
point.
for
the
reasons
i
just
state,
i
don't
think
this
is
true
but
if
we
had
done
that,
as
long
as
we
would
have
set
it
somewhere
at
around
1042
or
1050
both
upwards
and
downwards
and
that
would
not
benefit
the
producers
quite
a
bit.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
correct.
we
used
the
1000
figure
which
is
the
conventional
figure
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
for
downward,
and
we
used
the
figure
approximating
what
was
conventional
without
bonuses
for
the
upward.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
adjustment.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
now,
maybe
belatedly
let
me
turn
the
basic
legal
challenges
to
the
commission's
action
in
this
case.
the
court
in
giving
a
green
light
to
area
rate
making
in
the
second
phillips
case,
as
we
already
made
clear
or
rather
reiterated,
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
impose
any
special
method
for
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates,
and
particularly
that
the
individual
company
prudent
investment
costs
of
service
technique
which
has
become
conventional
in
utility
rate
making
since
this
court
decision
in
hope
is
not
the
only
perhaps
to
a
reasonable
end
result
in
dealing
with
the
industry
like
natural
gas.
the
essential
difficulty
when
utilizing
individual
company
costs
and
pricing
natural
gas
were
set
out
by
the
commission
in
the
second
phillips
decision
and
are
summarized
in
justice
harlan's
decision
affirming
the
commission.
in
short,
unlike
a
normal
utility
fixing
a
transportation
or
communications
or
heating
and
lighting
service,
prudent
investment
and
gas
exploration
will
have
only
a
tangential
relationship
to
the
end
product
of
what
you
will
get
at
and
maybe
more
important,
the
conversiveness
equivalent
grades
of
gas
from
producers
with
different
cost.
now,
whether
this
results
from
efficiency
or
luck,
whatever,
will
not
and
should
not
have
different
values
in
the
marketplace,
likewise
are
not
going
to
play
high
prices
to
one
producer
and
another.
even
if
as
certainly
is
not
the
case
in
this
industry,
even
if
gas
were
sold
on
a
cost
or
price
competitive
basis.
and
the
fact
which
i
think
measures
--
mentioned
in
phillips
previously,
that
two
or
more
producers
with
quite
different
cost
frequently
share
the
same
well
or
the
same
lease,
only
is
a
further
illustration
of
the
absurdity
of
attempting
to
price
on
the
individual
cost
basis.
there
are
other
problems.
as
the
court
pointed
out,
individual
company
pricing
will
penalize
the
person
who
takes
the
risk
and
reward
the
person
who
say
–
say
for
a
fellow
who
follows
after
him
because
the
risk
taker
will
have
less
cost
for
buying
leases
on
a
property
where
they
don't
expect
gas.
then
the
fellow
comes
along
later
and
buys
on
the
periphery
of
a
known
gas
reserve.
and
of
course,
the
extremely
grave
administrative
problems
in
fixing
rates
separately,
even
for
the
45
major
producers
say
nothing
with
the
smaller
producers
is
significant.
the
record
in
this
case
here
fully
confirms
the
validity
of
the
commission's
original
determination
on
this
case.
in
fact
it
goes
beyond
this.
it
suggest
that
no
pricing
system
based
on
individual
producers
cost
will
provide
any
real
picture
of
even
that
producer's
long-term
cost.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
cost
for
even
of
the
largest
of
producers
who
might
be
expected
because
of
the
sheer
magnitude
of
their
operations
to
balance
out
very
tremendously
from
year
to
year,
and
not
only
very
tremendously
from
year
to
year
but
there's
many
pattern
within
any
one
producer.
now
on
the
contrary,
the
evidence
on
this
record
also
indicates
that
for
the
industry
as
a
whole,
there
are
meaningful
cross
trends,
reasonably
three
of
this
board
swings.
thus,
we've
got
to
a
situation
here
where
you
can
really
say
that
for
almost
any
given
producer,
the
average
industry
cost
rather
than
any
historical
cross
section
of
his
own
cost
at
a
particular
moment
for
several
years
will
be
a
far
more
likely
indication
of
what
his
probable
cost
are
for
the
future.
of
course
true,
that
this
group
average
experience
will
not
be
reflected
by
any
individual
company
at
any
given
moment
but
more
in
the
long
run
to
good
years
balancing
bad
years.
but
this
is
the
true
and
accurate
picture
of
this
industry.
and
attempting
to
price
individually
would
distort
the
structure.
if
you
--
if
a
particular
company's
cost
for
a
given
year
of
what
you
have
used,
given
a
series
of
years
which
you've
used
as
test
years
were
high,
higher
than
average
and
you
set
its
prices
on
this
basis.
would
be
a
very
good
chance
that
he'd
be
going
into
a
low
cost
period
that
is
high
cost
or
because
he
had
made
investment
which
hadn't
matured
yet
and
that
in
fact
would
be
setting
a
windfall
price
range.
at
the
same
time,
if
you
set
--
if
an
individual
company
has
low
cost
for
a
test
period
and
you
set
his
individual
rates
on
this
low
cost,
just
as
good
a
chance
that
he
is
about
going
to
a
high
cost
cycle
and
will
be
in
trouble
as
a
result
of
that.
in
short,
group
or
area
rate
making
not
only
makes
sense
to
the
industry
as
a
whole
in
the
consumers,
but
it
makes
more
sense
than
anything
else
for
the
individual
producer.
now
these
tracks
in
our
opinion
alone
would
support
the
use
of
the
area
rate
procedure
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
directive
that
we
couldn't
use
but
there's
plenty
of
judicial
pressing.
i've
already
referred
to
the
phillips
case
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
which
have
consistently
indicated
that
an
area
rate
proceeding
might
be
an
appropriate
way
for
handling
producer
rates.
more
important
than
this
maybe,
under
a
virtually
identical
statute,
this
court
has
held
involving
the
packers
&
stockyards
act,
this
court
has
held
in
the
tagg
brothers
case
at
280
f.2d
–
from
280
u.s.
in
the
acker
and
corrick
cases
in
298
that
you
can
have
group
price
making
under
this
type
of
statute.
and
the
f.c.c.
has
group
price
making
in
the
international
telegraph
field
under
a
similar
type
of
statute.
and
of
course,
the
numerous
federal
and
state
statutes
providing
for
group
rate
or
price
making
in
milk
and
coal,
warehousing,
insurance,
and
aviation,
all
indicates
that
there
isn't
any
statutory
or
constitutional
need
to
fix
rates
which
are
geared
to
individual
company.
specifically,
this
is
maybe
the
guts
of
the
legal
issue
here.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
statutory
or
constitutional
right
for
any
claim
that
because
average
group
cost
will
necessarily
be
higher
than
the
cost
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
group
at
any
given
time
and
lower
than
the
cost
of
others
that
high
cost
producers
are
entitled
to
rates
to
meet
their
so-called
cost.
as
i've
indicated,
everything
in
this
record
indicates
that
over
the
long
run,
most
individual
producers
cost
will
fluctuate
around
the
industry
average,
and
that
today's
high
cost
producers
will
be
tomorrow's
low
cost
producers
and
vice
versa.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
might
run
into
a
problem,
but
let
me
attempt
in
the
next
few
minutes
to
what
we
think
should
--
how
that
problem
should
be
narrowed.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
yes
you're
right,
they
did
think
our
escape
clause
was
too
broad
or
something.
what
i'm
saying
isn't
a
new
proposition
clause.
the
stockyard
cases
which
i
mentioned,
packers
&
stockyard
cases
which
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
court
expressly
made
clear
in
those
cases
that
the
fact
that
the
approved
rates
would
mean
in
some
marginal
dealers
with
high
cost
wouldn't
make
any
profit
at
all
did
not
invalidate
the
decision
and
did
not
involve
confiscation.
and
this
really
is
the
universal
reading
of
group
rate
making
cases,
going
back
as
far
as
munn
versus
illinois,
let
me
read
if
i
may
what
this
court
said
in
321
u.s.,
bowles
v.
willingham
which
was
a
rent
fixing
case,
i
think
written
by
justice
douglas,
which
he
said
it's
implicit
in
cases
such
as
nebbia
v.
new
york
which
involved
the
power
of
new
york
to
fix
minimum
and
maximum
prices
of
milk.
and
sunshine
anthracite
coal
co.
v.
adkins
which
involved
the
power
of
the
bituminous
coal
commission
to
fix
minimum
and
maximum
prices
of
bituminous
coal,
that
high
cost
operators
may
be
more
seriously
affected
by
price
control
than
others.
but
it
has
never
been
thought
that
price-fixing
otherwise
valid
was
improper
because
it
was
on
a
class
rather
than
an
individual
basis.
now,
it's
true
and
in
some
of
these
cases
as
one
of
the
rationales
for
saying
the
people
could
be
hit
by
group
rate
making,
even
though
it
hit
them
farther
than
certain
other
people.
the
court
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
they
didn't
like
it,
they
could
get
out
in
the
business.
and
it's
equally
true
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
nobody
can
get
out
of
the
business
without
getting
abandonment
authority
from
the
federal
power
commission.
but
the
commission
has
made
clear
in
this
decision
that
it
would
continue
to
do
what
it
is
always
done
and
that
is
freely
permit
abandonment
an
out-of-pocket
cost
of
a
particular
well
exceed
revenues
of
that
well.
and
it
stated,
let
me
read
again
if
i
may
from
the
commission
decision,
this
actually
appears
at
659,
unlike
the
case
of
some
public
utilities
which
cannot
abandon
service
without
harming
a
public
dependent
thereon,
we
will
seldom
have
a
situation
on
which
a
particular
producer's
abandonment
of
some
or
all
of
its
sales
in
the
area
will
significantly
affect
the
purchasing
pipeline.
say
nothing
to
deal
with
consumers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
significantly
the
affect
the
purchasing
pipeline
to
say
nothing
of
the
ultimate
consumer.
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
could
be,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
it
does.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
a
possibility
that
you
would
have
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
conflict
between
conservation
interest
and
the
abandonment.
it's
a
--
we
have
lots
of
these
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
people
have
abandoned
to
go
into
intrastate
commerce.
maybe
that's
the
solution.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
you
have
to
get
out
of
the
business.
it
isn't
like
the
rent
control
cases.
you
can
stay
in
the
business
from
going
to
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
--
what
you're
saying
is
a
possibility.
it
is
a
problem
here.
there
are
conceivable
situations
where
abandonment
is
not
the
alternative
where
some
other
relief
will
be
necessary
and
this
is
what
the
commission
said
and
provided
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
guess
–
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
am
not
--
i'm
not
--
it
gives
me
comfort
in
this
sense.
conceivably,
if
you
took
the
lid
off
completely
or
set
a
very
high
price,
obviously,
one
factor
of
that
would
be
to
some
extent
it
would
be
to
encourage
a
lot
of
marginal
drilling
which
maybe
shouldn't
be
encouraged.
to
that
extent,
yes,
we
do
get
satisfaction.
but
we
recognized
the
need
for
continuing
exploration
and
development
and
within
the
proper
limits,
we
are
encouraging.
i
don't
know
what
to
say
in
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
addition,
anybody
claiming
confiscation
would
in
our
opinion
be
up
against
at
least
two
major
areas
in
this
cost
which
we
don't
think
is
part
of
any
confiscation
claim
at
all.
in
first
place,
the
commission
is
allowed
about
4
cents
for
e
and
d
allowance,
for
e
and
d
expenses.
these
are
expenditures
which
went
down
the
drain
which
didn't
produce
anything
of
value
for
the
customer.
now,
we
don't
agree
with
justice
clark's
suggestion
in
the
second
phillips
case
that
it
was
improper
to
allow
disallowance.
as
part
of
a
general
pricing
system
in
order
to
attract
revenue
to
this
industry,
these
expenses
are
part
of
the
cost
of
the
general
operation
in
this
industry,
but
producers
of
this
industry
have
no
obligations
whatsoever
to
take
their
revenues
and
put
them
back
into
production.
and
under
these
circumstances,
while
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
allow
disallowance
in
the
cost,
we
do
not
think
anybody
can
claim
constitutional
right
to
these
4
cents.
similarly,
we
don't
believe
that
anybody
coming
to
us
claiming,
“i'm
a
high
cost
producer”
has
a
right
to
claim
that
he
is
a
high
cost
producer
entitled
to
special
relief
because
he
isn't
making
12%.
this
rate
of
return
we
allowed
in
large
part
because
of
the
various
risk
of
this
very
industry.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
certainly.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
that
if
he
isn't
getting
his
out-of-pocket
expenses,
that
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
relief.
we
think
the
relief
will
normally
be
abandonment.
in
certain
cases,
this
may
not
be
possible
and
then
we
may
have
to
find
other
relief,
it
maybe
raising
his
lower
rates
on
some
of
the
contracts
which
he
got
a
contractual
limitation
on
and
maybe
otherwise.
in
that
situation,
yes,
he
is
entitled
to
relief.
and
this
is
what
he
commission
said
in
establishing
this
special
relief
procedure.
it
didn't
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
fuzzy
only
on
the
sense
the
commission
didn't
attempt
in
making
its
first
area
rate
determination
to
set
out
all
the
individual
exceptions
thereto.
it
did
say
that
there
is
some
area
where
your
cost,
vis-à-vis
your
revenues
will
involve
a
constitutional
issue
of
confiscation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
i
didn't
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
no,
i
didn't
say
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
said
it's
a
possibility.
the
reason
why
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
this
was
a
situation
in
which
somebody
could
have
five
times
the
normal
cost
as
a
result
of
well
drilling,
if
that
happened,
which
it
doesn't,
then
obviously
that
person
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
putting
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
isn't
even
involved
in
this
case.
the
people
who
only
drill
dry
holes
don't
even
get
this
as
far
as
the
commission.
they're
not
in
the
business
anymore.
the
person,
if
he
wants
to
put
gold
plating
on
his
well,
have
a
gold
plated
well,
and
maybe
some
of
the
people
in
this
industry
are
in
the
high
enough
tax
bracket
so
they
can,
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
that.
maybe
some
of
these
high
cost
producers
are
people
who
are
high
cost
producers
because
they
are
in
the
higher
tax
brackets
and
therefore
can
take
the
risk
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
cannot
give
you
a
situation
because
i
don't
know
whether
it
exists.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
i
don't
know
whether
it
exists.
i
can
tell
you
that
there
–
your
situation
where
somebody
is
entitled
to
relief,
at
least
to
getting
out
of
the
responsibility
of
staying
in
the
business
with
this
well.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
a
line
which
has
not
been
pricked
out
because
we're
at
the
start
rather
than
the
end
of
this
procedure.
if
the
commission
had
done,
attempted
to
do
what
the
court
below
seems
to
have
suggested
we
should
do,
not
only
established
a
general
price
structure
but
also
spell
out
all
of
the
possible
exceptions
thereto
which
are
conceivable
in
this
industry
we
would
not
only
--
never
finish
this
case
but
it
would
have
been
most
outrageous
thing
to
do
on
this
record.
we
established
a
procedure.
we
explained
that
it
was
available
for
the
people
with
out-of-pocket
expenses
with
respect
to
individual
wells
normally.
we
also
set
forth
other
reasons
where
it
might
be
used
or
certain
--
unlikely,
but
possible
cost
squeezes
which
people
can
get
into
as
a
result
of
some
of
our
pricing.
we
said
that
if
you
do
get
into
this,
we
don't
think
you
will,
but
if
you
do
come
around
and
ask
for
a
special
exception.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
of
course,
when
you're
in
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
are
special
relief
situations,
it's
very
difficult
when
somebody
asked
you,
“what
would
you
do
with
a
particular
case
which
we
haven't
had
before
us
yet?”
and
frankly
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
were
some
contract
prices
as
of
this
decision
as
high
as
20
cents.
there
were
some
old
contract
prices
lower
than
9
cents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
range
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
of
prices
in
--
there
are
always
some
deviations
for
types
of
gas.
but
the
range
of
prices
for
relatively
good
gas
at
the
time
of
this
decision
were
about
16
cents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
some
were
higher.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
industry
to
--
and
the
pipelines
to
operate
on
the
kind
of
a
posted
price
basis.
but
there
are
variations
within
these
standards.
if
people
have
very
little
gas,
the
pipeline
won't
spend
the
money
to
go
and
build
a
feeder
line
to
him.
if
people
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
understand
your
question.
the
record
indicates
that
the
general
price
range
is
the
major
factor
but
there
are
individual
situations
which
play
in
particular
contracts,
there
is
no
indication
that
these
individual
situations
aren't
related
in
anyway
to
costs.
it's
a
question
of
how
much
gas
a
particular
producer
has
at
a
particular
moment,
nobody
has
suggested
that
the
low
prices
were
for
low
cost
producers
or
the
high
prices
were
for
high
cost
producers
which
i
think
maybe
the
basic
problems
we're
getting
at.
we
also
think
there's
no
justification
for
the
court's
suggestion
that
this
special
relief
--
and
when
anybody
applies
for
a
special
relief,
he
should
be
able
to
stay
the
entire
commission's
decision
and
not
lower
his
--
higher
the
just
reasonable
rates
until
we
pass
on
this.
this
would
obviously
just
flood
us
with
this
request
to
keep
up
with
this
rate.
cases
such
as
the
new
england
division's
case
indicate
this
is
totally
unnecessary
and
that
the
real
proof
of
the
putting
here
is
that
we
have
allowed
in
either
the
old
gas
or
the
new
gas
were
such
a
higher
figure
than
the
out-of-pocket
costs
of
anybody
except
for
our
gold
plated
friend
that
the
ability
of
anybody
to
show
that
he
is
going
to
be
significantly
harmed
if
he
operates
under
these
ceilings
while
his
special
exemption
is
processed
is
in
our
opinion
nil.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
before
lunch,
i
was
talking
about
the
special
exemption
procedure
and
i
may
have
misstated
myself
in
talking
with
justice
white.
we
have
suggested
justice
white
that
we
will
allow
pre-abandonment
when
their
out-of-pocket
expenses
on
particular
sale
are
more
than
the
revenues
on
that
sale.
and
we
have
made
clear
that
we
will
not
do
that
and
we
see
no
immediate
necessity
for
any
special
relief
for
other
than
out-of-pocket
expenses
and
particularly
the
–
and
the
12%
rate
of
return.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
was
what
i'm
saying
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
at
all
that
the
commission
has
suggested
that
somebody
who
is
a
moderately
high
cost
producer
will
get
no
relief,
but
that
somebody
who
is
really
bad
will
get
relief.
on
the
contrary,
if
there
are
such
people
who
have
say,
50
cents
instead
of
--
or
a
dollar
cost,
if
that
means
anything
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
not
so
much
that
there
are
–
well,
there
are
in
the
circumstances.
it's
a
standard
operating
procedure
in
this
industry
to
have
individual
wells
become
unprofitable.
this
is
nothing
new.
the
commission
for
years
has
worked
a
simple
procedure
for
these
wells
which
become
unprofitable
to
be
dropped
out.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
not
saying
there
is
any
justification
for
giving
a
higher
price
and
the
commission
hasn't
said
so.
it
said
what
clearly
isn't
the
justification
and
i
don't
want
to
give
any
false
impression
that
if
a
producer
can
show
that
his
prices
are
on
the
average,
30
cents
higher
than
other
people,
and
that
this
is
something
which
is
not
the
result
of
bad
management
or
shooting
for
the
moon
by
going
off
on
the
marginal
prospects,
hoping
it
will
strike
it
rich,
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
want
to
give
any
impression
that
anybody
who
really
has
high
prices
and
can
show
that
this
is
going
to
continue
to
have
high
prices
will
be
allowed
to
do
anything
more
than
gradually
get
out
of
the
business.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
group
of
producers
who
suggest
that
area
rates
will
swell
but
the
cost
is
not
a
good
basis
for
area
rates.
i
think
there's
great
balance
at
this
stage
of
area
rate
making,
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
at
all
for
the
commission
not
to
use
cost
as
a
basic
yardstick
in
determining
area
rates.
there
maybe
stages
once
you
have
the
cost
base
started
out
whereby,
as
economic
situations
change,
the
factors
other
than
cost
may
become
increasingly
more
important.
firstly,
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
would
have
been
appropriate
from
the
standpoint
of
making
sure
that
the
consumer
is
not
being
--
getting
--
paying
more
than
he
needs
to,
whereas
to
start
out
absent
of
cost
basis.
but
even
assuming
that
it
will
be
legally
possible,
obviously,
the
commission's
determination
to
use
cost
is
a
judgment
of
the
commission
which
a
very
heavy
burden
would
be
on
anybody
trying
to
offset.
and
certainly,
this
burden
hasn't
been
met
here.
as
usual,
i
find
my
time
is
running
and
therefore
i'm
not
going
to
go
in
my
argument
here
very
much
into
the
matter
which
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief
as
to
why
the
argument
that
there's
free
competition
in
this
industry.
and
that
that
alone
is
good
enough
to
justify,
relying
on
the
market
price
rather
than
a
cost
based
price
is
sufficient.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
although
there
are
a
lot
of
producers
in
any
field
and
they
compete
among
themselves
for
new
leases
that
there
isn't
a
type
of
price
competition
which
will
--
can
be
depended
upon
to
protect
the
public.
on
the
contrary,
the
history
of
pricing
in
permian
is
very
much
like
the
history
of
pricing
in
southern
louisiana
which
lead
this
court
in
catco
to
say
something
has
to
be
done
and
the
regulatory
agency
has
to
move
in.
the
reasons
for
this
aren't
obscure,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
el
paso
divestment
case,
the
way
this
business
operates
is
a
pipeline
will,
in
addition
to
its
usual
increments
of
gas,
every
once
in
a
while,
it's
making
a
big
new
sale
and
needs
a
lot
of
gas
quickly.
then
it
has
to
go
to
the
producers
in
the
particular
area
who
have
the
gas,
these
are
usually
a
few
producers,
they
obviously
can
--
as
the
record
here
indicates,
it
can
get
the
prices
up.
the
history
of
this
business
is
this
quasi
posted
price
business
that
i
mentioned
before.
all
other
prices
go
up
and
with
the
escalations
in
the
old
contracts
even
the
prices
for
flowing
gas
goes
up.
when
you
add
to
this,
the
fact
that
one
of
the
major
pipelines
in
the
permian
basin
and
the
one
which
broke
the
pipe
--
the
price
line
but
good
in
1960,
the
transwestern
pipeline
was
at
that
time
very
largely
owned
by
producers,
and
when
you
add
the
strange
absence
of
serious
participation
in
this
case
by
the
pipeline,
you'll
see
what's
going
on.
i
said
i
tell
you
why
the
pipelines
didn't
participate,
a
very
simple
answer.
the
pipelines
much
more
than
one
would
--
might
suspect
can
pass
on
a
higher
price
as
they
get
to
their
customers
is
particularly
true
in
this
case.
the
residential
consumer
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
captive
customer
who
can't
switch
back
and
forth.
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
we're
dealing
with
california
where
the
industrial
consumer
also
is
dependent
largely
on
gas,
price
competition
does
just
not
hold
down
the
prices
and
the
pipelines
as
a
result
relatively
disinterested.
the
other
argument
with
respect
to
don't
use
cost
or
rather
if
you
use
it,
use
it
as
a
very
minor
factor
is
a
little
different.
it
goes
on
this
basis.
there's
too
little
gas
being
discovered
to
meet
future
needs
and
even
under
the
commission's
pricing
system
we
can't
be
sure
that
there's
going
to
be
enough
gas
discovered
therefore
don't
use
cost
or
anything
else
to
really
put
much
of
a
lid
on
it.
the
fact
that
in
every
year,
not
only
through
this
record,
but
since
this
time,
reserves
at
it
have
been
more
in
production
and
the
fact
that
in
permian,
since
the
commission
in
1960
put
a
guideline
price
on
which
is
about
the
same
as
the
new
gas-well
pipes,
have
been
tremendous
development,
is
discounted
and
what
this
type
of
argument
talks
about
is
the
declining
reserves
to
production
ratio
nationally,
the
rp
ratio.
this
has
been
going
down,
it
certainly
has,
it
was
about
32
to
1
at
a
time
when
gas
was
a
waste
product
and
it
has
been
going
down
steadily
ever
since.
slower
but
still
steadily
and
it's
now
about
16.5
to
1
and
may
go
down
through.
the
commission
recognized
this
and
so
it
wasn't
disturbed
by
this,
that
it
was
far
from
clear
that
the
present
ratios
are
not
too
high
in
the
sense
of
--
in
the
economy
and
the
consumer
standpoint
requiring
present
consumers
to
pay
for
too
much
gas
for
the
future.
the
oil
industry
which
is
certainly
not
comparable
in
all
respects,
the
rp
ratio
there
is
leveled
off
at
about
11
to
1.
and
far
from
clear
that
something
similar
to
this
wouldn't
be
equally
good
in
the
gas
industry.
the
commission
hasn't
ignored
this
problem.
the
commission
in
fact
added
one
cent
to
the
e
and
d
allowance
to
provide
for
exploration
and
development
greater
than
the
current
figure
in
order
to
provide
for
further
advancement
in
exploration
and
development.
let
me
be
clear
about
this
one.
we're
fully
aware
of
our
--
that
our
obligations
to
the
gas
consumers
and
we
think
that
is
to
fix
prices
at
the
lowest
possible
level
consistent
with
a
healthy
industry
and
reasonable
profits
to
the
producers,
cannot
be
met
by
ignoring
the
long-term
interplay
of
the
factors
of
supply
and
demand.
we
shall
and
must
continue
to
watch
current
and
future
trends
on
the
production
side
and
to
the
extent
that
price
can
play
a
positive
role
area,
be
prepared
to
adjust
prices
for
future
vantages
of
gas
to
meet
current
conditions.
but
on
this
point,
let
me
read
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hope
case,
in
response
to
a
similar
claim
by
the
state
of
west
virginia.
we
have
set
production
cost
there.
tends
to
be
cost
for
the
individual
pipeline
but
the
point
is
the
same.
at
too
low
a
level
to
insure
there'd
be
adequate
production.
and
what
justice
douglas
said
in
that
case
and
we
thinks
it's
completely
applicable
here
is
the
following.
i'm
reading
from
320
u.s.
at
615,
if
in
the
light
of
experience,
they,
that
is
the
rates,
turn
out
to
be
inadequate
for
the
development
of
new
sources
of
supply,
the
doors
of
the
commission
are
open
for
increased
allowances.
this
is
not
an
order
for
all
time.
this
is
equally
applicable
here,
and
the
16
and
a
half
to
1
rp
ratio,
that
means,
there
is
proven
reserves,
admittedly
understated
as
to
the
actual
reserves,
but
proven
reserves
16
and
a
half
times
the
present
production
is
more
than
adequate
to
provide
lead
time
if
this
in
this
year
shows
that
something
should
be
done.
now,
let
me
turn
to
our
third
group
of
producer
arguments
who
accept
as
at
least
within
our
discretion
reluctantly,
tying
cost
--
tying
rates
to
cost
yardsticks.
that
they
argue
and
here
they're
joined
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
commission,
either
by
fixing
minimum
as
well
as
maximum
rates
or
by
raising
the
maximum
rates,
has
to
ensure
that
producers
as
a
group
will
recover
revenues
equal
to
their
average
costs.
and
the
edge
--
alleged
failure
of
the
commission
to
make
this
assurance
was
certainly
one
of
the
main
grounds
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
remanding
it
to
us
because
the
court
said
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
end
result
test
in
hope.
it
will
also
form
this
court's
basis
on
rehearing
for
saying
that
the
refunds
cannot
be
made
even
on
increased
rates
which
are
above
the
just
and
reasonable
ceiling
we
have
set
here.
unless
we
first
find
out
they're
not
offset
by
lower
rates
which
some
of
the
producers
are
voluntarily
agreed
to
in
their
context.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
this
end
result
test
of
hope
to
requiring
a
balancing
of
cost
with
expected
revenues.
it
reversed
the
commission
because
it
did
not
specify
the
total
revenues
which
the
producers
would
secure
on
the
established
rate.
if
you
remember
justice
stewart,
the
same
argument
was
made
last
year
in
the
chicago
northwestern
division
case.
and
also
because
the
revenues
would
necessarily
not
equal
cost
average
cost
to
the
extent
that
contractual
limitations
precluded
producers
from
filing
from
appropriate
ceilings.
the
commission
in
response
to
this
letter
claimed
expressly
denied
its
intent
to
match
jurisdictional
revenues
with
jurisdiction
cost.
and
what
it
said
was,
and
i'm
reading
from
our
record
1114d,
it
would
be
contrary
to
all
regulatory
principles
to
permit
prices
in
excess
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
certain
purchases
merely
because
other
sales
have
been
voluntarily
made
below
costs.
but
the
commission
went
on
to
make
clear
that
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
that
overall
producer
revenues
would
be
inadequate
for
the
maintenance
of
the
healthy
industry.
now
the
court
of
appeals
was
dissatisfied
with
this
latter
conclusion
because
it
felt
that
the
failure,
i'm
quoting
from
the
court,
the
failure
of
the
record
to
disclose
the
revenue
impact
of
the
adjustments
in
the
area
rates
to
reflect
quality
differentials.
as
i've
already
indicated
but
i'll
expand
upon
a
little
bit
here,
that
this
is
just
plain
wrong,
it
overlooks
the
finding
of
the
commission
on
this
point.
now,
let
me
explain
this
problem
and
i
think
the
court
was
confused.
there
isn't
any
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
don't
pretend
there
is
as
to
the
pipeline
cost
at
their
processing
plants
of
bringing
the
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
and
therefore,
since
the
commission
was
establishing
the
system
of
matching
the
individual
sale
to
its
quality,
it
was
necessary
to
provide
for
a
special
procedure
of
quality
statements
filed
by
the
producers
at
the
consultation
with
the
pipelines
with
respect
to
the
particular
discount
for
the
particular
sale
as
a
result
of
the
particular
processing
operations.
but
there
was
evidence.
there
was
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
approximate
overall
impact
of
the
quality
reduction.
what
was
this
evidence?
first
of
all,
there
was
evidence
based
upon
producer
cost
in
their
processing
claim
of
performing
the
same
functions
of
bringing
gas
up
to
the
pipeline
quality.
secondly,
there
was
an
evidence
of
certain
contractual
provisions
and
some
of
the
contracts
where
pipelines
expressly
provided
for
their
--
they
should
be
reimbursed
where
they
had
to
bring
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
and
third,
there
was
expert
testimony
based
on
these
facts
as
to
what
the
impact
would
be.
this
wasn't
something
the
commission
invented.
the
examiner
--
it's
--
in
his
decision
had
quantified
this
that
about
1
to
1
and
a
half
cents.
the
concurring
commissioner
said
1
to
1.7
cents.
and
the
commission
in
the
light
of
certain
adjustments
to
quality
which
it
made
that
the
producers'
behest
on
rehearing
found
that
the
range
of
this
quantity
discount
would
be
.7%
to
1.5%.
and
what
they
found
on
the
basis
of
the
record
actually
squares
with
these
quality
statements.
there
is
thus
no,
if
i
may
use
the
term
the
court
used,
there
is
no
revenue
deficiency.the
question
at
all
is
with
respect
to
quality
adjustments.
the
producers
aren't
going
to
receive
the
ceiling
price
which
we
have
set
for
pipeline
quality
gas
for
the
large
percentage
of
permian
gas
which
is
far
from
pipeline
quality.
but
this
was
exactly
what
the
commission
anticipated
whether
it
adopted
a
rate
of
return,
deliberately
set
to
take
into
account
the
quantified
risk
that
permian
gas
would
not
qualify
for
ceiling
prices.
now
let
me
get
back
to
the
other
aspect
of
this
problem.
this
relates
to
contract
pricings
made
by
various
producers
over
various
periods
of
time
by
which
they
agreed
in
selling
gas
to
the
various
pipeline
at
the
maximum
price
they
could
charge
at
a
given
moment
was
x
and
x
may,
and
is
in
certain
areas,
less
than
we
have
found
the
maximum
they
could
have
charged.
the
court
of
appeals
originally
seems
to
have
believed
that
we
were
under
an
obligation
to
take
care
of
these
contracts
by
setting
minimum
rates
which
would
aviate
the
overall
impact
of
these
limitations
on
filing
up
to
the
area
of
ceiling.
now
rehearing,
it
seems
to
have
also
suggested
that
maybe
instead
of
setting
minimum
rates,
we
could
simply
set
the
base
rate
higher,
similarly
to
negate
the
effect
of
these
contractual
limitations.
but
while
it
isn't
entirely
clear
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
should
do,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
of
either
respect.
now,
what
is
the
basis,
the
legal
basis
for
this
position?
essentially,
we
go
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
mobil
and
the
sierra
pacific
cases
at
350
u.s.
--
at
332
and
348.
now,
the
point
of
these
cases
which
of
course
billed
on
earlier
cases
in
the
railroad
and
natural
gas
fields,
state
natural
gas
law
field,
the
point
of
these
cases
is
that
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
automatically
supersede
freely
made
contracts
between
buyer
and
seller.
contractual
limitations,
not
only
cannot
be
circumvented
by
the
sellers
filing
a
rate
increase,
under
section
4
of
the
act,
that's
the
mobil
case.
but
as
justice
harlan
made
clear
in
the
sierra
pacific,
the
commission
itself
cannot
and
shouldn't
raise
a
rate
which
by
contrary,
the
seller
in
this
industry
has
set
at
a
lower
figure
than
he
could
have
charged
merely
in
order
to
enable
that
seller
to
return
--
earn
the
full
return
that
would
have
been
permissible.
what
justice
harlan
said
there,
the
test
he
said
we
had
to
apply
and
the
test
we're
–
or
if
you're
willing
to
apply
here
too
is
that
before
somebody
volunt
--
before
somebody
who
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
a
lower
rate
to
perform
this
service,
that
he
might
have
been
entitled
in
this
range
of
what's
in
the
public
interest.
it
must
be
demonstrated
and
here
i
am
quoting,
“that
the
rate
is
so
low
as
to
adversely
affect
the
public
interest”,
as
where
it
might
impair
the
financial
ability
of
the
public
utility
to
continue
its
service,
passed
on
other
consumers
in
excessive
burden
or
be
unduly
discriminatory.
and
nothing
is
in
the
sierra
case
as
we
read
suggest
that
the
decision
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
company
involved
could
--
without
a
similar
public
interest
showing,
charged
rates
on
other
sense
higher
than
otherwise
would
be
appropriate
on
these
sales
simply
to
make
up
for
the
loss
in
maximum
profits
who
doesn't
voluntarily
agree
to
bear.
on
the
contrary,
the
natural
gas
act
which
we
were
construing
here
today,
expressly
states
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
that
all
rates
and
charges
of
a
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
any
such
rate
or
charge
that
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
hereby
declared
to
be
unlawful.
and
this
court
in
the
tennessee
case,
at
371
u.s.
similarly
made
clear
that
losses
in
the
first
instance
do
not
justify
illegal
gains
in
the
other.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
certainly
do.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
people
who
charge
a
series
of
rates
don't
charge
as
to
one
rate.
have
rights
under
special
circumstances
whether
to
charge
the
less
than
the
full
rate
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
regulatory
cost,
so
you
wouldn't
get
--
you
would
allow
them
to
have.
the
fact
that
they
charged
less
than
what
they
might
have
got,
in
our
opinion,
and
as
we
read
sierra
and
other
cases,
does
not
justify
them
to
charge
more
than
is
the
appropriate
rate
whatever
that
may
be.
on
other
side,
they
cannot,
in
other
words
--
because
they
have
voluntarily
entered
into
an
agreement
to
charge
one
customer,
less
than
they
might
have
charged,
they
raise
the
rates
to
the
second
customer.
the
customer
is
entitled
to
have
his
rate
no
higher
than
what's
just
and
reasonable
taking
--
and
not
to
have
a
higher
than
the
normal
rate
because
the
company
has
entered
into
lower
sales
with
other
people.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
the
contract,
typically,
relies
for
not
only
initial
rate
but
certain
escalations
in
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
he
may
file
for
these
escalations
in
this
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
he
has
a
contractual
right
to
bring
it
up
to
the
rate,
yes
he
has
a
contractual
right
to
bring
up
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
there
are
renegotiations
between
the
pipelines
and
the
producers
of
contracts
which
now
prohibit
the
filing
for
the
area
rate,
under
our
system
this
would
not
have
to
be
--
this
renegotiation
could
take
place
and
they
could
file
them
because
there
would
be
no
contractual
innovation.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
necessarily
unless
there
were
some
consideration
for
this
that
we
would
look
at
the
pipeline
when
it
comes
up
for
a
rate
increase
we
might
very
well
ask
the
pipeline,
what
was
the
consideration
for
you
--
allowing
higher
rates
where
you
previously
bargained
to?
as
far
as
the
producer
is
concerned,
renegotiation
is
appropriate
and
it
was
renegotiated,
that
were
fine.
we're
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
pipelines
were
unwilling
to
renegotiate.
they
want
to
stick
with
their
bargain.
let
me
explain
what
the
problem
is,
it's
very,
very
clear
in
permian.
a
lot
of
the
very
low
rates
here
are
the
result
of
the
bargains
made
by
northern
natural
gas
company
with
some
producers.
now,
northern
has
got
the
benefit
of
these
bargains,
and
this
is
going
to
benefit
its
customers
in
the
midwest.
a
lot
of
the
higher
rates
which
were
subject
to
refunds
here,
subject
to
reduction
of
the
result
of
el
paso
agreeing
to
high
charges
in
part
to
get
rid
of
some
of
these
escalations
that
we
mentioned
in
its
raise.
now,
maybe
northern
is
going
to
allow
that
the
goodness
of
its
heart
because
it's
so
important
to
it,
agree
to
allow
these
rates
to
be
raised,
but
the
problem
really
is
el
paso.
el
paso's
customers
have
been
paying
these
rates
which
we
found
to
be
too
high,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
should
get
any
relief
for
it,
both
from
the
area
of
reductions
for
the
future
and
in
refunds
for
the
past.
don't
get
me
wrong,
we
believe
that
the
sierra
test
is
applicable
and
if
somebody
can
show
that
these
low
contract
rates
are
in
fact
inhibiting
the
industry
from
performing
its
functions,
not
only
to
itself
but
to
its
customers
then
obviously
there
is
justification
under
–
that's
it
the
appropriate
tests
for
raising
these
low
contract
rates.
but,
there
hasn't
been
any
such
showing.
with
respect
to
the
new
gas-well
gas,
the
gas
--
the
prices
we've
set
for
new
gas-well
gas
for
the
future
perfectly
clear
that
there
can't
be
–
there's
some
showing.
they're
under
no
contractual
innovations.
we
haven't
set
any.
they
can
contract
for
the
area
rate.
it's
conceivable
as
some
of
the
producers
point
out
that
despite
these
innovations,
various
sales
will
in
the
future
go
for
less
than
the
area
rate.
but
certainly
this
is
not
the
basis
for
our
fixing
the
new
gas-well
rate
at
some
arbitrary
higher
figure
to
take
care
of
this
situation.
with
respect
to
the
old
gas-well
gas
rate
and
the
oil-well
gas
which
is
tied
to
this,
the
continuing
operations
here
are
--
as
i've
indicated
before,
basically
a
relationship
of
the
continuing
production
cost.
and
we
don't
see
how
anybody
is
going
to
make
any
showing,
certainly
not
on
the
group
basis.
certainly
not
of
the
group
basis
that
if
these
rates
are
not
raised
and
they
continue
to
have
to
get
what
they
contracted
for
here
that
this
industry
is
going
to
be
adversely
affected
from
the
public
interest
in
any
respect.
now,
let
me
make
a
very
strong
caveat,
i
don't
think
the
industry
can
come
close
to
making
a
sierra
type
point
and
they
certainly
haven't
made
it
on
this
record.
i
can
conceive
money.
individual
producers
with
high
embedded
cost
or
other
special
problems
who
could
make
the
sierra
form.
i
can
conceive
of
an
individual
producer
who
is
in
the
problem
that
justice
fortas
mentioned
before
who's
got
an
unprofitable
sale
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest
to
allow
to
be
abandoned,
i
believe
they're
on
that
sale
or
another
sale
has
a
contractual
limitation
coming
in
and
saying,
“this
is
good
justification
for
allowing
me
to
raise
the
contractual
limitation
here”.
and
we
do
think
it's
possible
that
there
will
be
on
an
individual
basis
pursuant
for
the
special
exception
procedure,
individual
showings
as
to
why
some
are
all
--
low
contract
rate
should
be
raised.
but
we
don't
think
this
is
a
general
matter
and
we
don't
think
it's
anything
that
requires
as
the
court
did
a
remand
to
the
commission.
and
what
i
have
said
here
is
at
least
in
our
opinion
equally
applicable
to
the
refund
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
so,
and
what
i'm
saying
specifically
is
that,
there
may
very
well
be
situations,
individual
situations.
for
a
part
of
the
relief
that
somebody
makes
under
this
special
exception
thing
will
be
to
relieve
him
from
a
particular
low
contract
which
are
squeezing
him
and
making
it
difficult
for
him
to
perform
as
a
producer
performing
useful
content
in
this
industry.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
correct.
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
court's
opinion
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement
of
the
commission's
opinion
that
we
could
not
and
certainly
don't
have
to
commit
ourselves
in
advance
as
to
how
we
will
treat
individual
situations
which
necessarily
vary
from
case
to
case.
now,
to
go
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
think
you're
right
also.
i
think
this
certainly
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
said.
one
of
their
problems
with
our
special
exemption
procedures
is
just
--
they
said
you
haven't
spelled
it
out
sufficiently.
you
haven't
stated
in
greater
--
of
detail
as
to
what
type
of
things
will
entitle
people
to
special
relief.
as
i've
indicated
before
on
that,
i
think
we
spelled
it
out
as
adequately
as
is
possible
at
this
stage
of
area
rate
making
in
the
absence
of
any
claims
of
this
nature
at
this
day.
i
don't
think
--
i'm
sure
there
wouldn't
--
i
sympathize
with
the
court
of
appeals,
obviously
the
more
that
an
agency
can
spell
out
how
it
will
react
to
individual
request
for
special
relief,
the
more
it
can
do
so,
the
better.
but
we're
dealing
with
a
problem
where
you
only
don't
have
the
record
to
do
it.
we
don't
have
the
claims
before
us.
and
to
ask
for
the
specificity
that
the
court
wanted,
in
our
opinion,
is
certainly
not
legally
necessary
and
under
the
circumstances
here,
it's
just
impossible.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
really
haven't
the
vaguest
idea.
i
tried
to
figure
out
how
we
could
comply
with
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
and
i
frankly
haven't
the
slightest
idea
how
we
could
comply.
unfortunately,
my
time
is
going
pretty
fast,
i
do
want
to
say
on
the
refund
business.
if
i
indicated,
the
refunds
are
largely
to
el
paso
whose
under
an
obligation
to
flow
them
onto
their
customers,
a
large
percentage
of
the
low
price
contracts
are
normal.
that
shows
you
the
type
of
problem
it
is.
the
court
of
appeals
originally
believed
as
we
think
rightly
that
refunds
of
rates
which
these
people
have
been
allowed
under
the
act,
to
put
into
effect
and
charge
only
upon
the
agreement
that
they
would
pay
back
to
their
customers
if
they
were
found
to
be
high
--
have
to
be
on
an
individual
basis.
the
court
was
persuaded
on
rehearing
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
phillips
case,
the
wisconsin
case,
precluded
that
termination
and
that
there
had
to
be
a
more
general
balance.
now
this
is
a
misreading
of
phillips.
briefly
what
happens
in
phillips
was
this.
if
you
remember,
we
started
out
to
fix
phillips
rates
for
all
its
sales
throughout
the
united
states.
some
of
these
sales
were
much
higher
and
some
of
them
are
much
lower
than
the
average
--
and
the
average
cost.
this
isn't
surprising.
there
sales
involved
there
were
not
only
in
permian,
there
is
hugoton-anadarko
which
is
the
oldest
and
shallowest
field
in
the
unites
states.
there
were
in
southern
louisiana,
they're
all
over
the
continent.
the
commission
didn't
finish
that
up.
it
never
got
the
rate
design
part
of
the
phillips
case
in
which
it
went
through
the
exercise
of
determining
whether
some
of
these
high
sales
were
or
were
not
in
the
light
of
the
particular
circumstances
too
high.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
presumption
that
they
were
above
a
just
and
reasonable
standard
in
their
area
merely
because
they
were
higher
than
the
phillips
cost
statute.
what
the
commission
did
was,
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
go
through
this
exercise
and
with
respect
to
the
10(4)
(e)
increased
rate
filings
we
have.
it
isn't
worth
our
time
or
anybody's
time
to
make
these
allocations
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
and
the
court
in
affirming
us,
made
very
clear
that
it
was
limiting
us
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
justice
harlan's
decision
noted
that
we
had
in
the
subsequent
case
said
that
a
high
rate
isn't
necessarily
justified
merely
because
the
comparison
of
overall
costs
and
overall
revenues
were
balanced
out.
but
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
the
rate
wasn't
locked
in
as
it
was
in
phillips
and
as
they
are
not
here.
and
he
also
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
in
the
hunt
case,
this
rate
was
higher
than
that
area's
average,
analogous
to
the
situation
here.
and
he
distinguished
the
phillips
situation
on
that
basis.
and
we
think
that
this
is
all
what
phillips
really
stands
for
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
that
particular
case,
it
was
justifiable
for
the
commission
as
was
said,
it
wasn't
going
to
go
ahead
generally
with
this
allocation
to
refuse
to
make
it
for
these
10
sales
on
the
off
chance
that
a
few
of
the
high
sales
might
turn
out
to
be
more
than
just
and
reasonable.
certainly,
that's
not
the
present
situation.
in
the
brief
time,
before
i
have
to
sit
down
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
word.
the
commission
has
done
another
innovative
thing
in
this
proceeding.
at
least
it's
innovative
as
far
as
the
federal
power
commission
is
concerned,
and
that
is
the
establishment
of
a
moratorium
on
any
increased
sales
for
a
discrete
period
of
time.
the
commission
in
excess
of
precaution
because
this
was
the
first
case,
because
of
the
nature
of
area
rate
making
at
this
stage,
limited
this
moratorium
to
a
two-year
period
that
would
expire
on
january
1st,
1968.
but
this
is
an
important
question
for
future
cases
and
this
is
by
no
means
moot
because
there
are
a
number
of
sales
increased
during
this
moratorium
period.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
works
out
to
a
little
more
than
two
years
in
this
case.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
the
two-year
moratorium
is
the
minimum
or
maximum
that
we
could
have
done,
and
what
we
chose
under
the
facts
of
this
case
of
the
status
of
area
rate
making
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
effect
of
that
is
for
the
commission
--
by
a
commission
act
to
eliminate
escalation
clauses
of
--
for
that
period.
this
isn't
a
unique
matter
as
you
remember
under
our
certificate
authority.
we
have
similarly
wiped
out
escalation
clauses
for
a
discrete
period.
and
this
court
has
upheld
this
authority
both
in
the
hunt
case
with
respect
to
temporary
certificates
and
the
callery
case
with
respect
to
permanent
certificates.
and
more
important
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
most
cases
by
the
way,
justice
harlan,
as
in
this
case,
we
haven't
precluded
all
rate
findings.
we've
allowed
them
up
to
the
ceiling
so
that
anybody
who
has
a
limitation
that
is
eliminated
during
this
period
and
at
least
$3
million
of
it
--
it
have
here
--
they
can
try.
we're
only
talking
about
increases
over
the
ceiling.
and
the
point
i
--
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
not
only
that
this
has
been
allowed
for
our
commission
by
the
certificate
authority
of
section
7,
but
we
think
that
it
is
equally
permissible
under
the
provision
of
section
5
of
the
act
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
which
provides
that
the
commission
shall
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
to
be
thereafter
observed
and
enforced
and
to
fix
the
same
by
order.
this
is
exactly
the
same
language
which
this
court
found
over
20
years
ago
in
the
u.s.
v.
corrick
case
at
298
justified
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
refusing
to
consider
rate
increase
filings
filed
under
an
identical
statute
in
section
4
of
our
act.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
when
the
commission,
in
a
rate
case
of
this
nature,
not
merely
responds
to
allowing
company
made
rates
to
go
into
effect.
but
where
the
commission
has
done
the
legislative
job
that
under
this
type
of
language,
the
commission's
action
in
effect,
justice
harlan,
takes
the
place
of
contractual
limitations
on
section
4
that
we
were
talking
about
in
the
mobil
case.
and
we
think
that
the
same
situation
here
certainly
justified
on
the
record
on
this
proceeding.
if
you
don't
mind,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
limited
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
let
me
take
care
of
couple
of
minor
matters.
there
were
some
statement
yesterday
by
texas
and
new
mexico
that
we
had
excluded
the
evidence
they
submitted.
the
attorney
generals
were
in
error
there.
we
did
not
exclude
the
evidence.
in
fact,
some
of
the
evidence
is
in
the
joint
appendix
here,
extracts
from
it.
it
was
admitted
into
the
record
and
was
considered.
we
did
reach
the
results
that
they
wanted
but
there's
no
exclusion
problem
involved.
now,
let
me
take
up
the
problem
which
i
did
not
take
up
in
my
initial
argument
which
was
raised
by
counsel
for
bass
yesterday
and
that
is
the
argument
that
the
commission
ignored
some
very
substantial
expenses
which
are
born
by
the
plant
sellers,
the
producers
who
purchase
on
--
normally
on
percentage
contracts
from
producers
in
the
field
gathered,
process
and
then
sell
at
the
tailgate
of
the
plant
and
the
argument
made
yesterday
was
--
that
it
was
outrageous
with
the
commission
to
fix
a
price
for
gas
at
the
tailgate
of
a
plant
after
gathering
and
processing
which
was
the
same
as
the
price
of
fixed
for
gas-well
gas
in
the
field.
now,
obviously
whether
the
commission
has
properly
or
improperly
decided
every
issue
here,
it
isn't
foolish
and
it
didn't
overlook
this
very
major
problem.
their
estimates
can
be
made
many
ways
but
probably
as
much
time
was
spent
on
cost
of
gasoline
plants,
so-called
gasoline
plants
in
this
record
as
any
other.
that
the
examiner
discusses
this
matter
in
great
detail
in
his
opinion
at
pages
226
to
231,
where
he
explains
why
despite
all
these
costing,
he
thinks
it
make
sense
to
price
it
on
a
value
basis
which
after
all
is
exactly
what's
happening
in
this
industry.
they
have
in
fact
sold
at
the
same
prices
roughly
as
the
price
of
the
pipelines
play
at
the
well
head
for
gas-well
gas.
and
at
pages
328
to
341,
if
you
want
to
go
through
a
very
interesting
exercise,
he
goes
into
great
depths
on
the
costing.
because
both
the
commission
and
the
examiner
in
coming
to
the
eventual
conclusion
that
an
exact
cost
involves
just
too
many
allocations
to
be
exact.
i've
done
so
only
in
the
light
of
a
recognition
that
they
were
not
by
so
doing
giving
too
little
for
these
various
expenses.
and
let
me
briefly
read
you
what
the
commission
said
in
response
to
bass'
arguments
or
with
similar
argument
very
point
on
rehearing
and
i'm
reading
from
1116
(d)
of
the
record.
they
say,
"it
has
been
stated
in
the
applications
for
rehearing
of
several
producer
respondents
that
the
price
of
residue
gas,
derived
from
casinghead
gas
should
be
fixed
at
a
higher
price
because
the
record
would
contain
evidence
which
would
establish
this
cost
for
the
level
above
the
14.5
cents
per
mcf
based
on
gas
well
it
cost".
the
record
does
not
support
this
argument.
on
the
contrary,
well
a
precise
cost
computation
of
residue
gas
cannot
be
made
with
sufficient
assurance
of
accuracy
sure
was
a
basis
for
fixing
prices.
the
evidence
demonstrates
the
cost
of
residue
gas
is
lower
than
the
cost
of
flowing
gas-well
gas.
it
reflects
in
the
evidence
and
then
they
go
on
to
discuss
certain
evidentiary
matters
which
had
been
raised
and
which
they
disagree
with.
now
this
is
not
at
all
the
picture
that
you
got
yesterday.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
this
further.
we've
discussed
it
pages
157
to
159
of
our
brief.
briefly,
let
me
refer
to
another
argument
made
by
counsel
for
bass
yesterday.
this
was
the
procedural
argument
with
respect
to
equality.
that
equality
wasn't
in
this
case.
very
difficult
point
it
seems
to
us
because
we
can't
quite
see
how
you
could
have
an
area
case
where
you
don't
consider
quality.
what
--
in
general
let
me
refer
you
here
if
i
may
to
pages
154
to
155
of
our
brief
and
particularly
to
the
statement
why
the
producers
when
they
try
to
tie
a
rule
making
proceeding
on
quality
to
the
permian
basin
decision,
what
they
said
was
not
that
it
was
in
the
permian
basin
case
but
they
said
was
and
i'm
quoting
from
there
--
to
my
brief
and
this
is
a
quote,
“the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
proceeding
have
introduced
evidence
regarding
quality
standards
in
price
differentials
and
planned
to
introduced
additional
evidence
on
such
points
when
appropriate”.
now,
what
the
commission
did
was
to
say
that
it
wasn't
going
to
in
the
light
of
those
statements
try
a
general
quality
thing
into
this
proceeding
that
nobody
thought
up
until
much
later
the
quality
wasn't
an
issue.
now
justice
fortas,
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
i
agree
with
the
counsel
for
socony
that
it
is
not
only
useful
from
the
standpoint
of
--
i
think
the
entire
industry
for
this
court
to
decide
the
moratorium
issue
but
that
--
this
moratorium
issue
is
not
moot.
the
technical
reason
for
moratorium
issue
is
not
moot
is
because
moratorium
in
a
state,
we
haven't
been
able
when
people
filed
increase
which
would
have
been
subject
to
the
moratorium
to
not
let
them
go
into
effect.
but
we
have
assumed
that
the
court
stay
on
the
moratorium
like
everything
else
were
subject
to
the
final
action
of
that
court
and
this
court.
and
the
commission
has
consisted
with
in
allowing
these
increases
to
go
into
effect
and
they're
clear
that
they
were
going
into
effect
subject
to
the
final
outcome
of
this
case.
so,
there's
considerable
amount
of
money
which
means
that
the
problem
is
not
moot.
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
went
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
would
result
in
refunds
for
those
producers
who
pursuant
to
the
stay
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
and
filed
increases
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
which
wouldn't
have
been
(voice
overlap).
that's
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
exactly.
i'll
give
you
something
back.
there
was
one
argument
here
which
we
don't.
i
won't
go
any
great
length.
that
is
the
argument
about
the
last
“clean
rate”
problem.
i
wouldn't
even
attempt
to
describe
it.
it
was
mentioned
in
some
of
the
briefs.
it
was
mentioned
by
counsel
for
mobil
yesterday.
i
don't
--
they
want
to
decide
it
in
may
but
the
fact
is
on
this
one,
the
commission
expressly
refrained
from
deciding
it.
it
has
not
been
decided
by
the
commission.
at
the
time
of
the
commission's
decision
it
wasn't
clear
whether
it
was
a
real
problem
or
not
and
we
said
we'd
handle
it
when
we
got
it.
so,
this
is
not
something
which
is
the
part
of
the
commission
decision.
now,
briefly
on
the
problem
that
mr.
gilliam
was
speaking
this
morning,
speaking
to
this
morning.
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
justice
white
that
there
is
a
finding.
the
finding
is
that
1115
(d)
of
the
record
and
what
the
finding
is
there's
a
longer
paragraph
on
the
matter.
it
says,
with
the
charges
--
changes
we
have
made
with
respect
to
quality
standards,
the
average
adjustments
for
gas-well
gas
will
range
from
0.7
to
1.5
reduced
by
the
additional
revenue
for
plant
liquids
and
the
effect
of
the
btu
adjustment.
there
is
evidence
upon
that
--
which
that
is
based
on
--
it
is
evidenced
which
mr.
gilliam
doesn't
think
is
good
evidence.
this
evidence
we
think
is
clearly
good
enough
evidence
as
well
as
the
exporter.
and
the
evidentiary
references,
i
will
not
labor
the
court
with
but
they
are
cited
in
our
brief
in
the
footnote
15
at
pages
142
to
143
of
our
brief.
finally,
like
my
client
put
back
on
the
track
what
i
think
mr.
gilliam's
argument
comes
down
to.
i
don't
think
once
we
get
out
of
this
morass
of
quality
that
this
is
a
real
problem.
there
is
a
real
problem.
what
they
are
really
saying,
they
phrased
it,
what
mr.
gilliam
did
this
morning,
in
terms
of
letting
us
have
the
opportunity
to
earn
this
cost
based
standard
price.
but
what
this
really
boils
down
to
is
saying,
set
your
rates
to
guarantee
that
the
--
we
will
earn
these
revenues
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
on
a
number
of
our
sales
previously
contracted
to
charge
less.
and
that
is
what
the
problem
is
really
all
about
on
the
so-called
revenue
deficiency
argument
and
i
think
or
as
i
know
this
is
something
that
i
hope
i
explain
in
some
detail
on
tuesday.
oh,
may
i
say
one
more
word
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
lack
of
material
in
the
briefs
on
some
of
the
costing
matters
which
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
get
to.
we
are
asking
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning
that
the
court
affirmed
the
commission
on
all
of
the
case.
we
hope
that
our
brief
has
taken
care
of
the
matter
and
we
certainly
hope
that
the
result
of
this
case
would
be
a
full
affirmation
of
the
commission
decision.
so,
we
can
proceed
with
the
difficult
task
of
finishing
up
this
area
rate
making
process.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
case
on
clause
appeals
from
the
tenth
circuit
presents
for
the
court's
consideration,
the
validity
of
the
federal
power
commission's
first
area
rate
determination
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
sale
by
producers
of
natural
gas
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
the
particular
decision
here
involves
the
so-called
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico,
which
is
a
major
producing
area
responsible
for
approximately
12%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce.
off
of
this
gas,
roughly
three-quarters,
a
little
bit
more
than
three-quarters,
goes
to
the
california
market
and
the
remainder
to
on-route
are
points
in
arizona,
new
mexico,
texas
and
by
another
pipeline
to
the
midwest.
the
prices
fixed
by
the
commission
in
this
case
will
result
in
refunds.
that
is
refunds
with
respect
to
increased
prices
which
had
previously
been
suspended
by
the
commission
and
allowed
to
go
into
effect
subject
to
the
refund
obligation
of
approximately
$32
million
plus
interest.
in
addition,
and
certainly
no
less
important,
the
decision
will
result
in
annual
rate
reductions
beginning
as
of
september
1st,
1965,
the
date
of
the
commission's
decision,
of
approximately
$16
million
a
year.
but
obviously,
the
decision
although
important
for
itself,
has
greater
importance
in
establishing
the
legal
framework
for
all
producer
ratemaking.
and
this
includes
the
four
other
cases
that
we
now
have
before
the
commission
in
various
stages
which
together
with
permian,
when
they
are
completed
will
fix
the
rates
for
gas
flowing
in
interstate
commerce
approximately
93%.
in
other
words,
with
these
first
five
cases
by
process
of
packaging,
we
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
93%
of
the
gas
flowing
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir,
the
one
which
is
nearest
to
being
completed
is
the
southern
louisiana
area.
there
is
a
case
involving
the
so-called
hugoton-anadarko
area
of
kansas,
oklahoma,
and
texas.
there
is
a
case
which
is
concurrent
with
it
which
involves
three
of
the
texas
railroad
districts
along
the
gulf
of
texas.
and
there
are
some
newer
cases
which
has
packaged
all
of
the
areas
in
between
in
the
southwest
which
probably
will
depend
on
how
you
split
them
up
where
they're
closer
to
one
group
or
another.
yes,
it
is
different
areas.
we
are
strongly
urging
in
this
case
that
the
commission's
decision
be
infirmed
in
its
entirety.
now,
the
genesis
of
the
action
under
review
here
today
is
of
course
the
commission
--
this
court's
decision
in
1954
in
the
phillips
case,
hearing
of
347.
it's
first
held
with
the
rates
which
natural
gas
producers
should
sell
their
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce,
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission.
i
don't
think
i
really
have
to
go
into
detail
with
this
court
as
to
the
history
during
the
succeeding
six
years,
or
rather
a
board
of
history
of
the
commission's
attempts
to
resolve
this
price
in
question
by
conventional
individual
company
cost
of
service
rate
making
technique.
as
you
are
aware,
in
the
second
phillips
case,
which
in
this
court
is
styled
wisconsin
against
the
federal
power
commission,
decided
in
1962
in
volume
373.
in
the
second
phillips
case,
the
commission
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
individual
company
prudent
investment
cost
of
service
technique
made
no
sense
for
the
natural
gas
industry,
economically,
administratively
does
not
acquire
it
legally.
instead,
it's
cited
that
would
institute
these
area
rate
proceedings
of
which
this
is
the
first.
in
the
interim,
building
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case,
the
commission
has
utilized
its
conditioning
authority
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
to
as
the
court
put
it,
hold
the
line,
this
program
has
worked.
it
does
not
only
stopped
the
previous
spiral
of
prices
which
the
court
is
aware
of,
but
its
resulted
in
the
last
seven
years,
in
price
reductions
below
contract
levels
which
for
the
seven-year
period
have
aggregated
about
$134
million.
and
i
want
to
say
that
there're
another
$20
million
in
refunds
which
will
ride
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
another
series
of
cases
to
be
heard
later
this
term.
the
petition
--
the
commission's
1960
phillips
decision
decided
that
we
were
going
to
regulate
by
area
rates,
but
i'm
afraid,
it's
fair
to
say,
a
very
little
else.
accordingly,
when
the
commission
instituted
the
permian
proceeding
which
it
did
roughly
two
months
thereafter,
that
on
december
23rd,
1960,
there
were
virtually
no
guidelines
as
to
how
the
parties
to
--
should
proceed,
or
for
that
matter,
what
the
commission's
real
intent
was.
i
very
strongly
suspect
that
this
uncertainty
together
with
certain
language
in
the
phillips
decision
itself
which
could
be
read
as
indicating
that
the
commission
would
drop
consideration
of
costs
and
rely
largely
on
unregulated
field
prices
was
responsible
for
the
unhappiness
of
the
consumer
interest
such
as
the
state
of
california,
who
unsuccessfully
challenged
the
phillips
decision
in
this
court.
but
as
i
will
show,
that
if
this
was
what
they
were
afraid
of,
their
fears
have
not
--
their
fears
were
unwarranted.
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court
in
evaluating
the
commission's
end
product
here.
if
i
briefly
outline
the
procedure
the
commission
followed
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
order
of
december
23rd,
1960
named
about
330
producing
parties
who
were
--
had
filed
rates
on
file
in
the
permian
area
as
respondents.
and
in
addition,
about
47
other
parties,
some
big
and
some
small,
were
allowed
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
that
the
commission
held
a
prehearing
conference
in
midland,
texas
in
march
1961,
to
try
and
workout
with
the
party
some
way
of
proceeding.
but
again,
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
very
little
was
accomplished
here,
except
what
i
guess
was
important,
a
recognition
that
there
wasn't
any
real
agreement
as
to
how
area
rates
should
be
established.
the
one
thing
that
did
come
out
of
this
proceeding
in
subsequent
discussions
among
the
parties
was
agreement
that
there
should
be
a
cost
questionnaire
developed
by
the
commission
staff
with
the
assistance
of
the
industry.
and
since
it
was
recognized
that
the
preparation
and
the
filling
out
and
compilation
of
this
cost
questionnaire
was
going
to
take
time,
it
was
decided
that
they
would
--
we
would
split
up
of
the
hearing
and
we
would
start
the
hearing
with
general
evidence
on
the
economic
phases
of
the
industry.
now,
this
economic
phase
in
the
--
of
the
hearing
were
important
phase
of
the
hearing,
started
in
october
of
1961.
it
started
essentially
with
producer
testimony.
they
stressed
as
one
would
expect
the
alleged
existence
of
a
free
and
competitive
market
for
the
sale
of
gas
from
producers
to
pipelines.
and
the
more
--
they
need
to
encourage
gas
exploration
and
development
to
meet
the
ever
increasing
demands
for
gas.
the
producers
in
effect
asserted
that
the
only
way
the
country
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
enough
gas
to
meet
these
increasing
needs
was
by
substantial
price
encouragement
to
the
producing
industry
to
go
out
and
explore
for
and
develop
new
gas
fields.
and
this
they
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
permian
basin
would
necessitate
a
ceiling
price
of
about
20
cents
which
was
roughly
about
4
cents
higher
than
the
going
price
for
gas
in
permian
at
that
time.
now,
in
the
course
of
this
presentation,
the
producers
presented
some
very
significant
and
fairly
unique
as
of
that
time
evidence
that
the
production
industry
which
formulate
had
been
very
much
tied
together
between
the
exploration
and
development
of
oil
and
gas,
was
that
they
were
locked
together
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
that
the
production
industry
as
of
about
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
this
case,
you
can't
fix
a
definite
date,
some
people
got
this,
what
i'm
about
to
say
earlier,
others
who
were
getting
it
at
the
time.
but
roughly
about
this
1960
period,
the
production
industry
had
developed
the
ability
and
capacity
to
explore
and
drill
directly
for
gas
reserves
as
contrasted
with
oil
reserves.
now,
the
importance
of
this
is
perfectly
clear.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
important
to
the
basic
argument
being
made
by
the
producers,
because
as
long
as
gas
is
merely
a
byproduct
of
oil,
the
argument
that
you
need
very
high
prices
to
induce
gas
exploration
obviously
is
not
a
very
good
one.
but
if
now
for
the
first
time,
you
could
really
explore
for
gas
individually,
and
if
you
could
decide
where
you're
going
to
put
your
money,
that
price
arguably
became
significant.
the
producers
put
forward
this
directional
argument
as
a
contention
that
there
should
be
a
general
increase
in
prices
or
at
least
a
high
ceiling
applicable
to
all
gas.
they
did
this
despite
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
the
gas,
flowing
gas,
was
oil-well
gas
or
what
in
this
standpoint
is
the
same
thing,
residue
gas
produced
from
oil-well
gas.
let
me
--
maybe
i
be
better
to
find
some
terms
that
i'll
be
throwing
around
here.
by
gas-well
gas,
we're
talking
about
dry
gas,
gas
which
more
or
less
is
not
connected
with
oil.
it's
about
--
it
comes
out
of
reservoirs
which
are
not
oil
reservoirs.
as
we'll
get
into
in
a
few
minutes,
there's
a
serious
problem
here
too
because
gas-well
gas
or
at
least
most
gas-well
gas
does
have
some
heavy
hydrocarbons
condensate
which
are
liquefiable
and
which
not
only
are
liquefiable
but
which
are
probably
more
valuable
economically
if
they
are
liquefied.
so
we
still
have
the
condensate
liquid
problems
to
deal
with.
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
proportion
of
gas-well
gas
is
increasing.
in
permian
basin,
there
was
at
the
time
of
this
decision
still
roughly
two-thirds
oil-well
gas.
the
permian
basin
essentially
started
out
as
being
one
of
the
big
oil
reservoirs
of
west
texas.
but
even
in
permian
basin,
the
gas-well
percentage
is
increasing
nationally.
it
is
i
think,
almost
up
to
50%
or
maybe
higher
are
--
well,
66%
nationally
now.
and
i
think
everybody
in
this
room
recognizes
and
believes
that
the
future
here
lies
with
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
two-thirds
of
it
nationally
–-
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
is
now
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
you
can't
talk
that
way.
the
original
gas
discoveries
in
kansas
or
the
thing
which
probably
more
than
anything
else
started
the
natural
gas
industry
is
the
pipeline
industry
was
gas-well
gas.
then
you've
got
a
lot
of
this
oil-well
gas
in
the
big
developments
in
texas,
then
in
northern
louisiana,
and
now
the
offshore
gas.
a
lot
of
the
offshore
gas
which
certainly
bring
major
gas
is
coming
in
as
gas-well
gas.
it's
exceedingly
rich
and
condensate.
so
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
natural
gas
industry,
but
it's
not
oil.
well,
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
--
this
directional
hypothesis
were
put
forward
as
a
general
claim
for
a
price
increase,
even
though
most
of
the
gas
in
permian
to
be
priced
was
oil-well
gas
or
residue
derived
from
the
oil
ones.
and
even
though
all
of
the
flowing
gas
or
practically
all
of
the
flowing
gas
had
been
developed
prior
to
the
time
in
which
there
was
any
significant
directional
search.
now,
the
reason
for
this
of
course
and
maybe
i
should
mention
this
again
because
another
basic
fact
is
distinguished
with
this
industry
from
certain
others,
is
that
gas
is
sold
on
20-year
contracts.
actually,
these
contracts
after
they
expire
they
tend
to
be
even
further
selling,
gasses
sold
now
which
was
developed
15
to
20
years
ago.
and
the
flowing
gas
of
1960
isn't
gas
that
was
developed
in
1960.
now,
based
on
the
facts
that
i
just
mentioned
and
the
recognition
that
gas-well
gas
is
the
need
for
the
future,
the
distributors
in
their
economic
presentation
put
forward
to
the
commission
a
basic
new
approach
to
the
whole
subject
of
gas
pricing.
they
relied
largely
on
policy
testimony
by
dr.
alfred
kahn,
the
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
cornell
university,
has
developed
a
more
concrete
terms
by
his
economists
statistician,
what
have
you,
colleagues
of
a
private
organization
going
under
a
rather
fancy
name
of
the
national
economic
research
associates.
i
would
-–
i
should
give
any
impression
that
this
is
a
governmental
body.
and
the
distributors
working
through
these
people
developed
what
has
been
known
as
the
two-price
system,
which
the
commission
eventually
adopted.
they
started
from
the
premise
and
that
there
is
a
finite
and
discernible
cost
for
the
separate
search
development
and
production
of
gas
as
distinguished
from
oil.
and
dr.
kahn
proposed
that
if
this
is
the
case,
that
the
new
gas-well
gas,
the
gas
of
the
future,
the
gas
which
was
going
to
be
responsive
to
price
and
was
the
gas
that
needed
to
adduced,
should
be
separately
priced
from
the
old
stuff
and
should
be
priced
not
on
historical
cost
concepts
but
price
on
the
basis
of
its
own
current
cost
for
this
search
and
discovery
of
gas,
this
of
course
would
achieve
a
number
of
basic
advantages.
afar
from
the
least
is
that
it
would
eliminate
in
this
basic
pricing
determination
many
of
the
more
difficult
allocation
problems
which
have
driven
us
all
mad
in
this
case
of
trying
to
determine
what
the
joint
cost
of
oil
and
gas
should
be
when
they
are
joint
product
that
people
aren't
--
are
really
operating
one
better
than
the
other.
and
i
said,
there
are
still
all
these
all
problems
of
condensate
but
at
least
you
got
rid
of
the
--
the
oil
part
of
it.
in
addition
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
are
similar
but
they're
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what,
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
we
don't
think
so.
and
if
you
look
at
the
decision,
you'll
see
for
example
that
in
this
new
gas-well
pricing,
instead
of
making
an
allocation
of
embedded
cost,
what
the
commission
was
able
to
do
using
the
information
supplied
in
the
record
by
both
producers
and
distributors
in
picking
and
choosing
the
proper
ones,
was
to
price
the
gas
and
have
priced
the
operation
which
leads
to
gas
and
have
a
condensate
liquid
credit
based
upon
the
value,
and
on
regulated
liquid
business
and
simply
determine
that
the
liquid
credit
which
is
what
these
people
are
getting
from
liquids
is
the
part
of
the
cost
which
can
be
subtracted
from
gas,
and
to
a
large
extent,
avoid
these
allocations.
now,
we
do
have
some,
i
don't
want
to
oversell
this,
like
most
things,
this
is
a
matter
of
degree.
but
if
you
will
read
the
very
good
discussion
on
this
in
the
commission
decision
and
the
examiner's
decision,
you'll
see
that
the
very
great
advantages
and
improvements
were
made
on
this
issue.
the
other
point
i'm
trying
to
make
and
certainly
equally
important
is
that
by
this
two-price
system
based
on
a
current
cost
for
gas,
we
are
able
to
adjust
prospectively
gas
prices
as
conditions
in
the
cost
or
otherwise
required
without
automatically
raising
the
price
on
oil
as
other
flowing
gas
and
giving
windfalls
to
people
who
produce
gas
under
very
different
conditions.
this
is
not
important
in
terms
of
the
permian
decision
that
we
have
here
before
us.
this
math
that
we
could
fix
and
did
fix
a
cost
based
price
for
new
pipeline
gas
of
$16
and
a
half
cents
without
affording
the
2
cent
windfall
which
would
have
resulted
if
we
priced
flowing
gas
at
this
price
which
on
historical
basis
came
out
to
$14
and
a
half
cents.
now
of
course,
you
could
have
done
it
another
way,
you
could
have
combine
these
prices
and
come
out
with
something
in
between.
but
if
you
would
have
done
that,
maybe
you
would
have
avoided
the
windfall
to
a
certain
extent
if
not
completely.
but
you
wouldn't
have
had
as
higher
price
for
the
new
development
and
search
as
the
commission
found
was
the
appropriate
price
if
you're
going
to
induce
enough
gas.
let
me
take
sometime
here,
it's
a
useful
thing
to
do,
to
discuss
some
of
the
arguments
against
this
two-price
system.
nobody
was
bored
originally
except
the
distributors,
the
staff
of
the
commission
and
the
staff
of
the
california
commission
argued
that
this
was
all
very
well
in
theory
but
there
really
hadn't
been
much
of
the
demonstration
that
this
directional
search
had
been
put
into
effect
as
yet.
and
they
said
that
under
these
circumstances
the
historical
method
was
appropriate,
particularly
since
the
evidence
indicated
that
there
were
not
any
great
price
up
trends
in
cost
since
about
1958.
the
commission
disagreed
with
this
and
concluded
that
the
evidence
did
show
that
there
was
a
real
increasing
directional
ability
here
and
that
it
would
agree
with
the
producer
and
distributor
evidence
on
this
point.
and
this
of
course
required
the
rejection
of
the
two
staff's
argument.
it
also
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
i'm
sorry
to
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
rejection
of
the
argument
against
the
directionality.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
one
of
the
interesting
things
as
i
will
bring
out
in
this
argument
is
the
relative
silence
of
the
pipelines.
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
distributors
are
primarily
a
group
of
the
distributors
of
gas
in
california,
pacific
gas
&
electric,
pacific
lighting
companies,
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
the
people
who
are
selling
gas
on
the
firing
line,
one
of
the
more
interesting
factors
in
this
case
is
the
pipelines
are
much
less
interested
in
this
price
for
their
own
gas
even
though
its
one
of
the
major
components
of
the
costs.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
even
though
the
cost
of
purchased
gas
is
one
the
major
components
in
a
pipeline's
cost,
the
people
who
are
interested
in
price
here
and
the
people
who
are
arguing
that
the
price
should
come
down
and
knots
go
up,
the
people
who
were
fighting
this
case
from
a
consumer's
standpoint
outside
of
the
commission
and
outside
of
the
california
commission,
were
the
distributors,
not
the
pipelines.
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
this
which
i
will
get
into.
the
rejection
upon
the
acceptance
of
directional
capability
did
unfortunately
require
of
the
rejection
by
the
commission
of
a
major
pioneering
effort
by
the
staff.
our
chief
economist,
dr.
harold
warren
had
developed
and
put
into
evidence
an
econometric
study
attempting
to
relate
supply
and
demand
in
this
industry.
his
study
had
not
taken
into
account
directionality
and
the
commission
felt
that
as
a
result
of
this,
that
it
was
necessary
to
--
they
couldn't
rely
on
it.
the
commission
noted
with
respect
to
this
study
as
well
as
certain
other
imperfect
pricing
techniques
which
had
been
put
forward
here,
it's
hoped
that
future
developers
might
make
their
use
possible
in
subsequent
proceedings,
because
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
we're
convinced
that
this
present
area
rate
decision
is
a
good
one.
fully
meeting
the
end
requirement
task
of
the
hope
--
but
we
don't
suggest
it's
the
final
word
and
we
know
that
we're
going
to
develop
further
insight
into
this
problem
with
experience
in
the
other
cases
and
with
experience
in
our
future
review.
the
producer
argument
of
the
gas
two-price
system,
was
of
course
that
they
should
--
as
i
said,
that
they
should
get
the
higher
price
for
all
of
their
gas.
and
it's
most
unsophisticated
level
that
the
argument
is
gas
is
gas.
and
the
consumer,
the
pipeline,
can't
tell
whether
a
molecule
was
old
gas
or
new
gas,
but
therefore,
even
if
the
old
gas
had
been
developed
as
a
pure
byproduct
of
the
search
for
oil,
it
should
have
the
same
price.
we
don't
think
this
is
a
really
a
good
argument.
this
is
the
same
type
of
argument
that
got
this
industry
into
trouble
though
the
indefinite
escalation
clauses
whereby
everybody
in
the
industry
would
always
get
the
highest
price
that
was
being
charged
at
a
later
date.
now
you
can
--
just
as
well
say
money
is
money
which
of
course
it
is,
but
that
doesn't
mean
--
because
money
is
money,
that
where
interest
rates
on
a
mortgage
--
mortgages
go
up,
that
the
interest
rates
on
old
--
the
old
mortgages
go
up
as
well.
the
fact
is
that
gas
maybe
gas
molecularly
but
the
value
of
gas
and
the
cost
of
gas
at
different
times
and
on
different
circumstance
are
not
the
same
thing.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
think
it's
somebody
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
understand
your
question.
i'm
not
an
engineer.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
engineering
question
so
much
as
a
geological
question,
various
techniques
of
seismograph
and
other
things.
we
are
just
better
equipped
to
judge
on
the
basis
of
what
we
know
before.
whether
if
you
drill
at
this
particular
spot
to
a
given
level,
that
you're
more
likely
to
hit
a
gas
reservoir
as
contrasted
with
an
oil
reservoir.
now,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
absolute.
somebody
drills
right
under
this
building,
you
probably
won't
hit
anything,
but
there
are
obviously
be
no
basis
to
determine
whether
this
is
going
to
be
oil
or
gas
if
they
hit
something.
this
is
a
basis
of
accumulated
experience.
but
it
is
pretty
well
established
now
that
this
industry
does
what
inland
--
know
what
it's
going
to
search
for
when
it's
searching.
the
other
contention
against
the
two-price
system
is
that
a
one
price
high
price
should
be
allowed
for
all
gas
because
revenues
from
gas
have
been
the
primary
source
for
reinvestment.
but
as
the
commission
pointed
out
the
allowances
in
the
old
gas
price
here,
in
over
beyond
out-of-pocket
cost,
the
allowances
for
exploration
and
development
in
dd&a
depreciation,
depletion
and
what's
that?
i
forgot.
in
return,
will
all
provide
more
than
adequate
revenues
for
reinvestment
if
the
price
is
right.
if
the
price
for
new
gas
isn't
right,
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
money
you
give
for
old
gas,
they'll
simply
put
their
money
on
other
places.
moreover,
the
producer
just
aren't
restricted
to
old
gas
revenues,
they
have
plenty
of
revenues
from
other
sources
which
they'll
put
into
gas
if
the
price
is
right.
and
they
have
accessed
to
equity
and
debt.
in
short,
gas
exploration
and
development
will
continue
as
long
as
there's
a
profitable
market
for
natural
gas
and
won't
continue
if
there
isn't.
the
choice
of
the
two-price
system
resulted
in
another
problem
for
the
commission
and
that
is
the
evidentiary
problem.
as
i
indicated,
we
had
agreed
to
prepare
and
did
prepare
with
the
cooperation
of
the
producers
and
the
distributors
and
the
clients,
a
detailed
cost
questionnaire.
the
data
from
this
cost
questionnaire
is
very
useful,
subsequently
used
as
the
basic
method
of
fixing
the
price
for
old
flowing
gas.
it
was
also
used
to
a
very
great
extent
for
new
gas
but
it
was
not
adequate
to
this
task.
it
was
not
adequate
to
this
task
because
it
had
been
geared
at
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
to
a
conventional
historical
cost
approach
and
there
was
a
lot
of
information
which
would
need
it
if
you're
going
to
get
a
current
cost
for
gas
discovery
which
was
just
not
in
this
cost
questionnaire.
now
this
presented
a
problem
but
it
was
not
an
insoluble
problem
and
the
breach
was
filled
and
testimony
by
both
producers
and
distributors,
by
a
careful
selection
by
expert
witnesses
of
information
taken
from
a
variety
of
sources
to
supplement
the
cost
information.
these
sources
range
from
the
united
states
census
of
mineral
industries,
to
a
chase
manhattan
bank
gas
survey,
to
information
developed
on
a
regular
basis
by
the
american
gas
association,
the
american
petroleum
institute,
to
trade
publications
such
as
the
oil
&
gas
journal
and
the
world
oil
magazine.
the
witnesses
were
on
an
agreement
generally
as
to
what
they
were
looking
for
by
way
of
information.
they
disagreed
as
to
what
was
the
better
source
when
there
were
one
or
more
source
to
be
picked
from
and
exactly
how
the
matter
would
be
derived
from
these
sources.
but
their
individual
expositions
on
this
matter
were
subject
to
most
extensive
and
thorough
cross-examination
and
most
careful
and
detailed
analysis
by,
first,
the
examiner,
and
second
by
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
the
information
collected
in
the
questionnaire
was
both
national
and
permian.
and
the
information
that
i'm
talking
about
now
is
the
broader
information,
was
in
some
respect
only
matched
as
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
only
matched,
so
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
decided
for
the
reasons
that
they
explained
in
some
detail
that
the
new
gas-well
gas
price
would
be
based
on
national
data
or
as
part
of
a
new
discovery
for
the
future
generally.
the
commission
also
decided
and
utilized
for
permian
figures
which
are
more
directly
related
to
permian.
but
even
there,
they
picked
and
chose
and
when
they
got
to
a
matter
like
exploration
and
development
expenses
for
dry
holes
for
the
non-product
of
the
search,
they
used
--
as
everybody
agreed,
they
had
to
--
national
figures.
the
commission
also
faced
up
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
justification
or
not
in
new
gas-well
price
for
separate
deviations
for
this
national
law
for
permian
cited
there
was
not,
this
has
not
been
shown
on
this
record.
these
selections
were
by
no
means
one
way.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
costing
is
largely
based
from
the
evidence
of
dr.
roseman
(ph)
who
was
a
witness
for
the
distributors,
but
there
are
situations
in
which
the
commission
found
he
was
too
low.
there
are
other
situations
where
they
found
he
was
too
high.
there
areas
where
they
picked
other
testimony
which
they
thought
better
reflected
the
true
fact.
this
picking
and
choosing
of
statistical
information
of
the
pipe
i'm
talking
about
has
been
criticized
in
the
briefs
here
primarily
by
the
sun
oil
company
as
being
outrageous
attempt
to
get
away
from
anything
which
is
real
in
the
way
of
cost.
it's
surprising
since
sun
or
the
other
producers
were
violently
against
the
effort
by
the
california
commission
to
adopt
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
but
actually
sun
was
right
and
california
was
wrong.
because
any
efforts
to
adopt
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
which
give
the
–
which
–
we'd
had
one.
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding,
it
would
have
almost
certainly
not
proved
adequate
to
the
past
because
this
whole
directional
idea
and
lot
of
the
other
developments
here
were
things
which
grew
up
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
we
picked
and
used
on
a
thoroughly
analyzed
basis,
good
statistical
sources
by
no
means
skew
against
the
industry.
we
analyzed
them
to
the
best
of
our
ability
and
the
argument
that
we
should
have
waited
until
there
could
be
agreement
as
to
a
uniform
system
of
accounting
and
statistical
information.
and
then
developed
area
rate
making
is
of
course
only
an
argument
that
we
should
postpone,
area
rate
making
in
depth,
the
commission
was
not
willing
to
do
this.
sun
is
also
challenged
and
maybe
it's
a
good
point
to
mention
this,
the
data
we
used
in
pricing
old
gas-well
gas,
the
flowing
gas,
now
here
the
information
from
the
cost
questionnaire
which
we
had
agreed
with
in
various
parties
was
available
and
usable.
and
it
was
used
as
the
basic
way
of
pricing
the
old
gas-well
gas.
it
was,
however,
and
i
think
this
is
not
unimportant,
wasn't
just
on
that
way.
the
examiner
has
suggested
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
technique
of
trending
back
the
new
gas-well
prices
that
he
had
found
on
basis
of
cost
trends
over
a
period
of
years
to
get
the
old
gas-well
gas.
and
the
commission
used
this
technique
as
a
check
against
its
historical
cost
and
technique
and
came
out
with
a
quite
comparable
figure
of
the
old
gas-well
cost
on
a
historical
basis
with
about
14.39
or
37.
on
the
trend
back,
it
was
14.67
or
something
like
that
and
the
commission
felt
that
this
was
a
reasonable
check
on
its
figure
which
had
grounded
off
to
14
and
a
half.
now,
sun
objects
to
the
appendix
b
form
which
was
the
basic
form,
cost
form,
which
were
used
for
this
old
gas-well
gas
because
it
says
it's
unrepresented.
in
fact,
this
appendix
b
form
includes
the
cost
for
the
producers
who
in
permian
account
for
85%
of
the
gas-well
gas.
sun
knew
that
the
figure
of
15%
on
some
place
or
other
achieves
this
figure
of
15%
by
simply
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
commission,
to
avoid
the
worst
of
these
allocation
problems,
justice
stewart,
shows
not
to
price
oil-well
gas,
flowing
oil-well
gas
at
all,
but
instead
priced
gas-well
gas
and
fixed
the
price
of
oil-well
gas
on
a
value
basis
at
the
same
level.
it
also
gets
this
low
figure
by
of
course
of
the
commission
in
another
similar
effort.
it
didn't
use
the
figures
which
we
had
on
the
record,
in
which
of
anything.
it
gives
a
slightly
lower
price
relating
to
so-called
combination
of
oil
and
gas
leases.
again,
we
avoided
using
these
figure
because
it
involved
an
allocation
between
oil
and
gas
which
we
thought
would
produce
a
result
less
true
than
if
we
didn't
used
these
figures
at
all
and
used
the
other
mass
of
material
we
had.
the
only
real
question
as
far
as
the
use
of
the
questionnaire
information
is
concerned,
as
i
said,
is
with
respect
to
small
producers
and
whether
these
costs
are
representative
of
the
cost
of
small
producers.
now
here
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
old
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
what
i
said
was
that
the
old
gas-well
gas
was
fixed
primarily
on
the
historical
cost
from
the
cost
questionnaire,
checked
out
against
this
back
trending.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
fixed
the
price
for
gas-well
gas.
we
did
not
fix
a
cost
for
oil-well
gas
or
residue
gas.
we
decided
that
the
costing
of
oil-well
gas
or
residue
gas
because
of
the
additional
allocation
problems
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
which
would
lead
to
horrible
fights
--
large
amounts
of
money
which
allocation
we'd
picked,
would
not
get
any
meaningful
figure
and
instead
we
said
that
this
gas
has
the
value
in
the
marketplace
as
the
marketplace
in
this
year
showed
of
the
gas-well
gas,
the
old
gas-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
we
will
give
them
that
price.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
have,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oil-well
gas
was
valued
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
knew
how
to
speak
briefly
about
the
small
producer
problem.
the
small
producers,
has
a
real
problem
on
information.
they
just
don't
maintain
the
type
of
books
upon
which
you
can
get
any
meaningful
information.
the
commission
tried
to
handle
this
by
providing
for
a
simplified
appendix
c
questionnaire
which
was
optional
for
small
producers
under
10
million
mcf
a
year
and
it
didn't
work
very
well.
of
about
285
small
producers
in
this
area,
25
of
them
chose
to
respond
on
appendix
b.
that's
the
main
one.
a
130
responded
on
appendix
c,
but
of
that
information,
only
60
of
them
had
anything
which
you
could
even
use
for
compositing
the
factors.
it's
true
and
an
argument
is
made
here
that
the
composite
cost
of
the
60
small
producers
who
did
submit
usable
material
on
appendix
c,
are
somewhat
higher
than
the
appendix
b
clause
which
we
used
for
old
gas-well
gas.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
25
small
producers
who
filed
on
appendix
b
who
went
about
as
much
gas
as
the
60
will
file
on
appendix
c,
it's
slightly
lower
cost
than
the
major
producers.
casting
real
doubt
upon
whether
these
higher
costs
on
appendix
c
were
really
meaningful,
and
moreover,
if
we
had
included
these
appendix
c
clause
in
our
old
gas-well
gas,
which
we
did
not,
the
total
effect
would
have
been
roughly
--
well,
it's
less
than
a
mill,
seven-tenths
of
a
mill
on
the
entire
business.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
we
--
in
our
decision
here,
as
the
result
of
this
ignored
small
producer
problems.
there
isn't
any
evidence
as
far
as
i
know
that
small
producers
really
have
lower
cost
on
the
overall
basis.
there
is
some
evidence
that
some
other
costs
are
lower
such
as
drilling
companies.
there
are
also
evidence
offsetting
this
that
some
of
their
cost
--
pardon
me,
some
of
their
costs
are
higher
really,
also
evidence
that
some
of
their
costs
are
lower.
they
used
the
geophysical
and
geological
and
lease
work
of
the
majors
in
the
like
piggyback
ride.
but
what's
more
important,
even
if
the
smaller
producers
as
a
class
did
have
demonstrably
higher
cost
which
they
don't,
it
wouldn't
materially
aid
them
to
set
a
separate
higher
price
for
their
gas.
the
reason
for
this
is
clear,
even
assuming
that
you
could
establish
different
prices
for
the
same
type
of
gas,
nearly
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
the
company.
the
pipelines
would
not
and
should
not
buy
gas
for
more
money
when
there's
gas
for
less
money
available
in
the
same
area.
and
the
small
producers
recognized
this
dilemma.
they
have
not
sought
a
higher
separate
price
for
themselves
and
they
have
not
even
asked
for
exemption
entirely
from
area
rates
as
various
people
including
justice
clark
of
this
court
has
suggested
from
time
to
time.
instead,
what
they
were
asking
is
that
the
highest
possible
price
for
all
gas
so
that
they
can
ride
along.
a
perfectly
reasonable
eye
concept
to
what
the
real
marketplace
is
here,
the
commission
was
understandably,
unwillingness
--
unwilling
to
raise
overall
prices
on
this
unproven
claims
of
the
small
producers.
but
they
have
done
two
important
things
for
smaller
producers.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
established
a
small
producer
certificate
system
which
allows
the
producer
to
get
out
of
the
administrative
burdens
which
are
much
more
real
for
them
than
for
the
big
company
of
continually
filing
with
our
commission.
now
they
can
get
one
certificate
which
is
good
for
all
of
their
sales
and
they
can
file
up
for
increase
as
their
contracts
permit
up
to
the
ceiling,
as
we've
said
here
without
bothering
to
come
to
us
with
rate
claims.
the
second
place,
we
have,
because
we
found
it
was
not
worth
the
price
to
do
otherwise
but
also
because
it
would
benefit
them,
relieve
them
from
observing
the
quality
differentials
that
the
commission
established
on
major
permission.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
problem
that
i
--
that
you
asked
before
justice
stewart.
this
quality
question
presented
another
major
problem
for
the
commission
acquiring
innovation
of
some
sort
or
another
from
itself
is
very
simple.
particularly
in
permian,
considerable
percentage
of
the
gas
which
the
pipeline
buy,
more
important,
not
what
they
buy,
considerable
percentage
of
the
gas
as
it
comes
to
the
pipeline
is
not
of
pipeline
quality
and
has
to
be
processed
by
the
pipelines
at
considerable
expense
for
them
and
their
consumers.
there
are
a
number
of
kinds
of
this
deficiency
which
were
set
out
in
the
record,
high
sulfur,
too
much
water,
too
little
pressure,
and
particular
nasty
thing
in
the
permian
basin,
other
gas
comes
out
with
a
lot
of
co2.
and
whereas
the
petroleum
industry
has
shown
tremendous
ability
to
make
use
of
all
sorts
of
wastes
and
byproducts,
so
far,
at
least
on
this
record,
they
haven't
figured
out
what
to
do
with
co2.
this
may
come
yet,
but
it
hasn't
come
out.
and
there's
additional
problem
and
that's
the
btu
problem.
btu
is
the
heating
content
of
the
gas.
i
think
its
british
thermal
units.
gas
as
it
comes
out
of
the
round,
depending
on
its
molecular
structure
is
of
this
different
heating
value.
the
btu
problem
will
come
back
to
as
a
little
different
than
these
others
because
it
goes
both
up
and
down.
now,
the
producer
said,
don't
worry
about
the
quality
problem,
you
can
depend
on
the
pipelines
to
bargain
this
down
from
any
ceiling
rates
you
set
for
bad
quality
gas.
and
it
certainly
is
evidenced
that
the
pipelines
in
certain
areas
have
paid
less
for
low
pressure
gas
which
they
had
to
compress
to
bring
up
to
the
level.
but
there's
also
evidence
that
this
is
far
from
the
perfect
system
and
the
commission
was
unwilling
to
do
this
while
a
lot
of
gas
which
has
a
low
quality
get
the
ceiling
because
there
hadn't
been
such
provisions
and
contracts
and
allow
a
higher
in
effect
ceilings
for
bargaining
in
the
future.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
treat
the
risk,
a
very
real
risk
in
the
permian
basin,
of
finding
and
developing
gas
of
less
than
pipeline
quality.
as
one
of
the
major
elements
which
it
relied
upon
in
fixing
the
12%
rate
of
return
which
fixed
not
for
average
quality
gas
but
as
the
return
for
finding
pipeline
quality
gas.
in
other
words,
it
said,
essentially
the
risk
of
finding
low
quality
gas
is
analogist
to
the
risk
of
finding
no
gas
or
the
risk
of
finding
gas
in
insufficient
quantities.
and
we
will
consider
it
as
one
of
the
major
elements
in
determining
on
a
12%
rate
of
return
on
investment
here.
the
court
of
appeals
in
one
stage
of
its
opinion
seems
to
have
thought
this
was
wrong,
that
the
--
rather
being
treated
as
risk,
we
should
treat
as
a
producer
cost.
we
don't
understand
this
because
obviously
this
is
not
a
producer
cost,
bad
gas
cost
of
producer,
no
more
and
no
less
than
good
gas.
and
the
gas
we're
talking
about,
the
processing
cost
we're
talking
about
here
are
the
cost
which
the
pipelines
have
to
pay.
there
is
producer
of
processing
gas.
of
course,
there's
producer
processing
of
gas
in
permian,
but
where
the
producers
process
the
gas
in
permian
and
then
sell
it,
they
get
the
pipeline
quality
ceiling
price
but
without
any
discount.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
technique
the
commission
adopted
for
handling
this
difficult
quality
problem
is
necessarily
the
only
one.
the
examiner
equally
innovating
had
a
different
one
in
which
he
fixed
the
price
for
average
gas
and
then
had
a
--
what
you
call
a
gold
standard,
above
that
where
higher
quality
gas
and
a
compression
technique
for
lower
quality
gas.
and
the
--
whereas
this
is
far
from
--
perfected
in
the
examiner's
opinion,
this
a
possible
approach
to
the
problem
also.
we
adduce
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
sour
means
too
much
salt.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
it's
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
not
peculiar
to
oil-well
gas.
i
am
sure,
but
i
have
not
the
confidence
to
tell
you
what,
that
some
of
these
deficiencies
are
more
likely
in
some
areas
than
other,
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
sure
there's
a
correlation,
but
there
are
deficiencies
and
sometimes
major
deficiencies
with
gas-well
gas
as
well
as
oil-well
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
different
magnitude,
different
degree,
that's
right.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
commission
decided
that
rather
than
a
general
reduction,
it
would
have
the
quality
of
each
individual
sale
determined
on
the
basis
of
relationships
between
--
agreements
between
the
pipeline
sellers
as
to
what
the
actual
cost
of
bringing
this
gas
is
up
to
pipeline
quality.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
costs
we're
talking
about
are
borne
by
the
pipelines.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
sure!
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
sure!
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
a
processing
plant
which
is
owned
by
the
producers
will
--
as
well
as
extracting
higher
btus,
usually
raise
the
quality
of
the
gas,
and
to
the
extent
of
the
producer
raises
the
quality
of
the
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
gets
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
he
gets
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
gets
the
higher
price
–-
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
well,
it
is
the
return
which
was
allowed
in
fixing
a
ceiling.
all
producers
won't
get
it,
some
will
get
more
and
some
will
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
get
it
less.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
one
of
the
factors
the
commission
mentioned
was
the
small
producers
in
fixing
a
return
as
high
as
12%.
but
it
was
not
specially
calibrated
to
the
small
producers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
85%
of
the
gas-well
gas
in
permian
was
produced
by
the
large
producers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
far
from
it.
this
was
one
of
the
minor
factors
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
that
was
taken
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
into
account.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
is
normal
in
rate
of
return
determinations,
the
commission
considered
lots
of
factors.
it
considered
notably
minor
factor
but
did
mention
the
small
producer
problem.
it
considered
as
a
major
factor
the
quality
problem.
it
considered
the
risk
of
finding
anything.
it
compared
the
risk
of
this
industry
with
the
pipeline
branch
of
it.
it
considered,
as
this
court
have
said,
it
must
consider
in
the
hope
case
and
other
cases,
what
comparable
industries
were
secured
so
that
it
–
you
make
sure
that
there'd
be
enough
of
an
investment
inducement
here
for
people
to
invest
in
this
industry.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly.
well,
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
on
this
quality
problem
at
this
point
because
i'll
get
back
to
it
a
little
later
is
that
the
idea
the
we
didn't
know
the
--
we
couldn't
quantify
it,
is
not
right
and
commission,
for
reasons
which
i'll
get
into
a
little
later
expressly
found
that
the
range
of
quantification
of
this
quality
business
was
going
to
be
between
about
seven
tenths
of
a
cent,
one
and
half
cent.
this
is
based
on
evidence
in
the
record.
we've
been
accused
of
supporting
this
by
post
record
filings
of
these
quality
statements
of
the
actual
amounts.
each
individual
sale
is
going
to
have
--
deducted
from
it.
now,
this
isn't
true.
then,
we
have
referred
to
these
filings
which
support
the
commission's
judgment
based
on
the
record
of
what
the
extent
of
the
quality
differential
would
be
because
it
does
show
we
were
right
and
because
we
know
that
if
the
specific
quality
statements
have
shown
that
we
were
wrong
by
2
or
3
cents
and
that
this
was
a
much
more
serious
problem
that
the
commission
had
counted
on
in
fixing
the
rate
of
return,
that
the
producers
quite
properly
would
be
back
here
saying,
“you
have
to
remand
it,
you've
made
a
serious
mistake
even
if
there
was
a
basis
for
you're
making”.
let
me
say
a
quick
word
about
the
btu
problem.
this
is
heating
content,
and
here
you
can
have
very
low
btu
and
very
high
btu
and
this
is
not
only
a
natural
phenomena,
but
much
more
important,
it
is
feasible
and
economic
for
pipelines
unless
there's
--
for
producers
unless
there's
a
good
reason
to
the
contrary
to
extract
the
high
btu's
which
can
be
converted
into
bottled
gas
and
sold
as
propane
and
butane.
now,
traditionally
in
this
area,
there
has
been
a
downward
btu
adjustment
starting
at
1000
btu
per
cubic
foot
and
the
commission
adopted
that
in
its
opinion.
traditionally,
there
has
been
no
upward
btu
adjustment
in
this
area,
but
traditionally,
the
average
value
of
btu
value
of
the
gas
sold
was
about
1042
btu
at
least,
this
were
the
best
statistics
we
could
get
on.
and
this
is
not
insignificant
because
particularly
in
this
area,
the
pipelines
sell
to
the
california
distributors
on
a
thermal
basis,
high
btu
gas,
they
don't
just
extract
it
for
their
own
operations.
the
commission
felt
that
significant
and
important
here
to
provide
an
inducement
to
the
producer
not
to
extract
the
high
btu's
before
it
got
to
the
pipeline.
and
they
provided
for
the
first
time,
unique
in
this
area
for
upward
btu.
they
set
the
upward
btu
in
a
1050,
an
approximation
of
the
average
btu
in
the
area.
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
--
if
they
were
going
to
give
a
bonus
or
no
bonus
was
ever
before
been
given,
they
weren't
going
to
give
a
bonus
for
people
giving
less
valuable
gas
than
they
have
been
supplying
without
a
bonus.
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
understand
this
gap
of
figure
that
we
had
to
--
apparently
a
figure
that
if
we're
going
to
have
a
btu
adjustment
half
a
start
downward
or
an
upward
from
the
same
point.
for
the
reasons
i
just
state,
i
don't
think
this
is
true
but
if
we
had
done
that,
as
long
as
we
would
have
set
it
somewhere
at
around
1042
or
1050
both
upwards
and
downwards
and
that
would
not
benefit
the
producers
quite
a
bit.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
correct.
we
used
the
1000
figure
which
is
the
conventional
figure
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
for
downward,
and
we
used
the
figure
approximating
what
was
conventional
without
bonuses
for
the
upward.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
adjustment.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
now,
maybe
belatedly
let
me
turn
the
basic
legal
challenges
to
the
commission's
action
in
this
case.
the
court
in
giving
a
green
light
to
area
rate
making
in
the
second
phillips
case,
as
we
already
made
clear
or
rather
reiterated,
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
impose
any
special
method
for
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates,
and
particularly
that
the
individual
company
prudent
investment
costs
of
service
technique
which
has
become
conventional
in
utility
rate
making
since
this
court
decision
in
hope
is
not
the
only
perhaps
to
a
reasonable
end
result
in
dealing
with
the
industry
like
natural
gas.
the
essential
difficulty
when
utilizing
individual
company
costs
and
pricing
natural
gas
were
set
out
by
the
commission
in
the
second
phillips
decision
and
are
summarized
in
justice
harlan's
decision
affirming
the
commission.
in
short,
unlike
a
normal
utility
fixing
a
transportation
or
communications
or
heating
and
lighting
service,
prudent
investment
and
gas
exploration
will
have
only
a
tangential
relationship
to
the
end
product
of
what
you
will
get
at
and
maybe
more
important,
the
conversiveness
equivalent
grades
of
gas
from
producers
with
different
cost.
now,
whether
this
results
from
efficiency
or
luck,
whatever,
will
not
and
should
not
have
different
values
in
the
marketplace,
likewise
are
not
going
to
play
high
prices
to
one
producer
and
another.
even
if
as
certainly
is
not
the
case
in
this
industry,
even
if
gas
were
sold
on
a
cost
or
price
competitive
basis.
and
the
fact
which
i
think
measures
--
mentioned
in
phillips
previously,
that
two
or
more
producers
with
quite
different
cost
frequently
share
the
same
well
or
the
same
lease,
only
is
a
further
illustration
of
the
absurdity
of
attempting
to
price
on
the
individual
cost
basis.
there
are
other
problems.
as
the
court
pointed
out,
individual
company
pricing
will
penalize
the
person
who
takes
the
risk
and
reward
the
person
who
say
–
say
for
a
fellow
who
follows
after
him
because
the
risk
taker
will
have
less
cost
for
buying
leases
on
a
property
where
they
don't
expect
gas.
then
the
fellow
comes
along
later
and
buys
on
the
periphery
of
a
known
gas
reserve.
and
of
course,
the
extremely
grave
administrative
problems
in
fixing
rates
separately,
even
for
the
45
major
producers
say
nothing
with
the
smaller
producers
is
significant.
the
record
in
this
case
here
fully
confirms
the
validity
of
the
commission's
original
determination
on
this
case.
in
fact
it
goes
beyond
this.
it
suggest
that
no
pricing
system
based
on
individual
producers
cost
will
provide
any
real
picture
of
even
that
producer's
long-term
cost.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
cost
for
even
of
the
largest
of
producers
who
might
be
expected
because
of
the
sheer
magnitude
of
their
operations
to
balance
out
very
tremendously
from
year
to
year,
and
not
only
very
tremendously
from
year
to
year
but
there's
many
pattern
within
any
one
producer.
now
on
the
contrary,
the
evidence
on
this
record
also
indicates
that
for
the
industry
as
a
whole,
there
are
meaningful
cross
trends,
reasonably
three
of
this
board
swings.
thus,
we've
got
to
a
situation
here
where
you
can
really
say
that
for
almost
any
given
producer,
the
average
industry
cost
rather
than
any
historical
cross
section
of
his
own
cost
at
a
particular
moment
for
several
years
will
be
a
far
more
likely
indication
of
what
his
probable
cost
are
for
the
future.
of
course
true,
that
this
group
average
experience
will
not
be
reflected
by
any
individual
company
at
any
given
moment
but
more
in
the
long
run
to
good
years
balancing
bad
years.
but
this
is
the
true
and
accurate
picture
of
this
industry.
and
attempting
to
price
individually
would
distort
the
structure.
if
you
--
if
a
particular
company's
cost
for
a
given
year
of
what
you
have
used,
given
a
series
of
years
which
you've
used
as
test
years
were
high,
higher
than
average
and
you
set
its
prices
on
this
basis.
would
be
a
very
good
chance
that
he'd
be
going
into
a
low
cost
period
that
is
high
cost
or
because
he
had
made
investment
which
hadn't
matured
yet
and
that
in
fact
would
be
setting
a
windfall
price
range.
at
the
same
time,
if
you
set
--
if
an
individual
company
has
low
cost
for
a
test
period
and
you
set
his
individual
rates
on
this
low
cost,
just
as
good
a
chance
that
he
is
about
going
to
a
high
cost
cycle
and
will
be
in
trouble
as
a
result
of
that.
in
short,
group
or
area
rate
making
not
only
makes
sense
to
the
industry
as
a
whole
in
the
consumers,
but
it
makes
more
sense
than
anything
else
for
the
individual
producer.
now
these
tracks
in
our
opinion
alone
would
support
the
use
of
the
area
rate
procedure
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
directive
that
we
couldn't
use
but
there's
plenty
of
judicial
pressing.
i've
already
referred
to
the
phillips
case
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
which
have
consistently
indicated
that
an
area
rate
proceeding
might
be
an
appropriate
way
for
handling
producer
rates.
more
important
than
this
maybe,
under
a
virtually
identical
statute,
this
court
has
held
involving
the
packers
&
stockyards
act,
this
court
has
held
in
the
tagg
brothers
case
at
280
f.2d
–
from
280
u.s.
in
the
acker
and
corrick
cases
in
298
that
you
can
have
group
price
making
under
this
type
of
statute.
and
the
f.c.c.
has
group
price
making
in
the
international
telegraph
field
under
a
similar
type
of
statute.
and
of
course,
the
numerous
federal
and
state
statutes
providing
for
group
rate
or
price
making
in
milk
and
coal,
warehousing,
insurance,
and
aviation,
all
indicates
that
there
isn't
any
statutory
or
constitutional
need
to
fix
rates
which
are
geared
to
individual
company.
specifically,
this
is
maybe
the
guts
of
the
legal
issue
here.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
statutory
or
constitutional
right
for
any
claim
that
because
average
group
cost
will
necessarily
be
higher
than
the
cost
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
group
at
any
given
time
and
lower
than
the
cost
of
others
that
high
cost
producers
are
entitled
to
rates
to
meet
their
so-called
cost.
as
i've
indicated,
everything
in
this
record
indicates
that
over
the
long
run,
most
individual
producers
cost
will
fluctuate
around
the
industry
average,
and
that
today's
high
cost
producers
will
be
tomorrow's
low
cost
producers
and
vice
versa.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
might
run
into
a
problem,
but
let
me
attempt
in
the
next
few
minutes
to
what
we
think
should
--
how
that
problem
should
be
narrowed.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
yes
you're
right,
they
did
think
our
escape
clause
was
too
broad
or
something.
what
i'm
saying
isn't
a
new
proposition
clause.
the
stockyard
cases
which
i
mentioned,
packers
&
stockyard
cases
which
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
court
expressly
made
clear
in
those
cases
that
the
fact
that
the
approved
rates
would
mean
in
some
marginal
dealers
with
high
cost
wouldn't
make
any
profit
at
all
did
not
invalidate
the
decision
and
did
not
involve
confiscation.
and
this
really
is
the
universal
reading
of
group
rate
making
cases,
going
back
as
far
as
munn
versus
illinois,
let
me
read
if
i
may
what
this
court
said
in
321
u.s.,
bowles
v.
willingham
which
was
a
rent
fixing
case,
i
think
written
by
justice
douglas,
which
he
said
it's
implicit
in
cases
such
as
nebbia
v.
new
york
which
involved
the
power
of
new
york
to
fix
minimum
and
maximum
prices
of
milk.
and
sunshine
anthracite
coal
co.
v.
adkins
which
involved
the
power
of
the
bituminous
coal
commission
to
fix
minimum
and
maximum
prices
of
bituminous
coal,
that
high
cost
operators
may
be
more
seriously
affected
by
price
control
than
others.
but
it
has
never
been
thought
that
price-fixing
otherwise
valid
was
improper
because
it
was
on
a
class
rather
than
an
individual
basis.
now,
it's
true
and
in
some
of
these
cases
as
one
of
the
rationales
for
saying
the
people
could
be
hit
by
group
rate
making,
even
though
it
hit
them
farther
than
certain
other
people.
the
court
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
they
didn't
like
it,
they
could
get
out
in
the
business.
and
it's
equally
true
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
nobody
can
get
out
of
the
business
without
getting
abandonment
authority
from
the
federal
power
commission.
but
the
commission
has
made
clear
in
this
decision
that
it
would
continue
to
do
what
it
is
always
done
and
that
is
freely
permit
abandonment
an
out-of-pocket
cost
of
a
particular
well
exceed
revenues
of
that
well.
and
it
stated,
let
me
read
again
if
i
may
from
the
commission
decision,
this
actually
appears
at
659,
unlike
the
case
of
some
public
utilities
which
cannot
abandon
service
without
harming
a
public
dependent
thereon,
we
will
seldom
have
a
situation
on
which
a
particular
producer's
abandonment
of
some
or
all
of
its
sales
in
the
area
will
significantly
affect
the
purchasing
pipeline.
say
nothing
to
deal
with
consumers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
significantly
the
affect
the
purchasing
pipeline
to
say
nothing
of
the
ultimate
consumer.
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
could
be,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
it
does.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
a
possibility
that
you
would
have
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
conflict
between
conservation
interest
and
the
abandonment.
it's
a
--
we
have
lots
of
these
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
people
have
abandoned
to
go
into
intrastate
commerce.
maybe
that's
the
solution.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
you
have
to
get
out
of
the
business.
it
isn't
like
the
rent
control
cases.
you
can
stay
in
the
business
from
going
to
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
--
what
you're
saying
is
a
possibility.
it
is
a
problem
here.
there
are
conceivable
situations
where
abandonment
is
not
the
alternative
where
some
other
relief
will
be
necessary
and
this
is
what
the
commission
said
and
provided
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
guess
–
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
am
not
--
i'm
not
--
it
gives
me
comfort
in
this
sense.
conceivably,
if
you
took
the
lid
off
completely
or
set
a
very
high
price,
obviously,
one
factor
of
that
would
be
to
some
extent
it
would
be
to
encourage
a
lot
of
marginal
drilling
which
maybe
shouldn't
be
encouraged.
to
that
extent,
yes,
we
do
get
satisfaction.
but
we
recognized
the
need
for
continuing
exploration
and
development
and
within
the
proper
limits,
we
are
encouraging.
i
don't
know
what
to
say
in
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
addition,
anybody
claiming
confiscation
would
in
our
opinion
be
up
against
at
least
two
major
areas
in
this
cost
which
we
don't
think
is
part
of
any
confiscation
claim
at
all.
in
first
place,
the
commission
is
allowed
about
4
cents
for
e
and
d
allowance,
for
e
and
d
expenses.
these
are
expenditures
which
went
down
the
drain
which
didn't
produce
anything
of
value
for
the
customer.
now,
we
don't
agree
with
justice
clark's
suggestion
in
the
second
phillips
case
that
it
was
improper
to
allow
disallowance.
as
part
of
a
general
pricing
system
in
order
to
attract
revenue
to
this
industry,
these
expenses
are
part
of
the
cost
of
the
general
operation
in
this
industry,
but
producers
of
this
industry
have
no
obligations
whatsoever
to
take
their
revenues
and
put
them
back
into
production.
and
under
these
circumstances,
while
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
allow
disallowance
in
the
cost,
we
do
not
think
anybody
can
claim
constitutional
right
to
these
4
cents.
similarly,
we
don't
believe
that
anybody
coming
to
us
claiming,
“i'm
a
high
cost
producer”
has
a
right
to
claim
that
he
is
a
high
cost
producer
entitled
to
special
relief
because
he
isn't
making
12%.
this
rate
of
return
we
allowed
in
large
part
because
of
the
various
risk
of
this
very
industry.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
certainly.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
that
if
he
isn't
getting
his
out-of-pocket
expenses,
that
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
relief.
we
think
the
relief
will
normally
be
abandonment.
in
certain
cases,
this
may
not
be
possible
and
then
we
may
have
to
find
other
relief,
it
maybe
raising
his
lower
rates
on
some
of
the
contracts
which
he
got
a
contractual
limitation
on
and
maybe
otherwise.
in
that
situation,
yes,
he
is
entitled
to
relief.
and
this
is
what
he
commission
said
in
establishing
this
special
relief
procedure.
it
didn't
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
fuzzy
only
on
the
sense
the
commission
didn't
attempt
in
making
its
first
area
rate
determination
to
set
out
all
the
individual
exceptions
thereto.
it
did
say
that
there
is
some
area
where
your
cost,
vis-à-vis
your
revenues
will
involve
a
constitutional
issue
of
confiscation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
i
didn't
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
no,
i
didn't
say
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
said
it's
a
possibility.
the
reason
why
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
this
was
a
situation
in
which
somebody
could
have
five
times
the
normal
cost
as
a
result
of
well
drilling,
if
that
happened,
which
it
doesn't,
then
obviously
that
person
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
putting
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
isn't
even
involved
in
this
case.
the
people
who
only
drill
dry
holes
don't
even
get
this
as
far
as
the
commission.
they're
not
in
the
business
anymore.
the
person,
if
he
wants
to
put
gold
plating
on
his
well,
have
a
gold
plated
well,
and
maybe
some
of
the
people
in
this
industry
are
in
the
high
enough
tax
bracket
so
they
can,
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
that.
maybe
some
of
these
high
cost
producers
are
people
who
are
high
cost
producers
because
they
are
in
the
higher
tax
brackets
and
therefore
can
take
the
risk
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
cannot
give
you
a
situation
because
i
don't
know
whether
it
exists.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
i
don't
know
whether
it
exists.
i
can
tell
you
that
there
–
your
situation
where
somebody
is
entitled
to
relief,
at
least
to
getting
out
of
the
responsibility
of
staying
in
the
business
with
this
well.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
a
line
which
has
not
been
pricked
out
because
we're
at
the
start
rather
than
the
end
of
this
procedure.
if
the
commission
had
done,
attempted
to
do
what
the
court
below
seems
to
have
suggested
we
should
do,
not
only
established
a
general
price
structure
but
also
spell
out
all
of
the
possible
exceptions
thereto
which
are
conceivable
in
this
industry
we
would
not
only
--
never
finish
this
case
but
it
would
have
been
most
outrageous
thing
to
do
on
this
record.
we
established
a
procedure.
we
explained
that
it
was
available
for
the
people
with
out-of-pocket
expenses
with
respect
to
individual
wells
normally.
we
also
set
forth
other
reasons
where
it
might
be
used
or
certain
--
unlikely,
but
possible
cost
squeezes
which
people
can
get
into
as
a
result
of
some
of
our
pricing.
we
said
that
if
you
do
get
into
this,
we
don't
think
you
will,
but
if
you
do
come
around
and
ask
for
a
special
exception.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
of
course,
when
you're
in
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
are
special
relief
situations,
it's
very
difficult
when
somebody
asked
you,
“what
would
you
do
with
a
particular
case
which
we
haven't
had
before
us
yet?”
and
frankly
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
were
some
contract
prices
as
of
this
decision
as
high
as
20
cents.
there
were
some
old
contract
prices
lower
than
9
cents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
range
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
of
prices
in
--
there
are
always
some
deviations
for
types
of
gas.
but
the
range
of
prices
for
relatively
good
gas
at
the
time
of
this
decision
were
about
16
cents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
some
were
higher.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
industry
to
--
and
the
pipelines
to
operate
on
the
kind
of
a
posted
price
basis.
but
there
are
variations
within
these
standards.
if
people
have
very
little
gas,
the
pipeline
won't
spend
the
money
to
go
and
build
a
feeder
line
to
him.
if
people
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
understand
your
question.
the
record
indicates
that
the
general
price
range
is
the
major
factor
but
there
are
individual
situations
which
play
in
particular
contracts,
there
is
no
indication
that
these
individual
situations
aren't
related
in
anyway
to
costs.
it's
a
question
of
how
much
gas
a
particular
producer
has
at
a
particular
moment,
nobody
has
suggested
that
the
low
prices
were
for
low
cost
producers
or
the
high
prices
were
for
high
cost
producers
which
i
think
maybe
the
basic
problems
we're
getting
at.
we
also
think
there's
no
justification
for
the
court's
suggestion
that
this
special
relief
--
and
when
anybody
applies
for
a
special
relief,
he
should
be
able
to
stay
the
entire
commission's
decision
and
not
lower
his
--
higher
the
just
reasonable
rates
until
we
pass
on
this.
this
would
obviously
just
flood
us
with
this
request
to
keep
up
with
this
rate.
cases
such
as
the
new
england
division's
case
indicate
this
is
totally
unnecessary
and
that
the
real
proof
of
the
putting
here
is
that
we
have
allowed
in
either
the
old
gas
or
the
new
gas
were
such
a
higher
figure
than
the
out-of-pocket
costs
of
anybody
except
for
our
gold
plated
friend
that
the
ability
of
anybody
to
show
that
he
is
going
to
be
significantly
harmed
if
he
operates
under
these
ceilings
while
his
special
exemption
is
processed
is
in
our
opinion
nil.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
before
lunch,
i
was
talking
about
the
special
exemption
procedure
and
i
may
have
misstated
myself
in
talking
with
justice
white.
we
have
suggested
justice
white
that
we
will
allow
pre-abandonment
when
their
out-of-pocket
expenses
on
particular
sale
are
more
than
the
revenues
on
that
sale.
and
we
have
made
clear
that
we
will
not
do
that
and
we
see
no
immediate
necessity
for
any
special
relief
for
other
than
out-of-pocket
expenses
and
particularly
the
–
and
the
12%
rate
of
return.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
was
what
i'm
saying
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
at
all
that
the
commission
has
suggested
that
somebody
who
is
a
moderately
high
cost
producer
will
get
no
relief,
but
that
somebody
who
is
really
bad
will
get
relief.
on
the
contrary,
if
there
are
such
people
who
have
say,
50
cents
instead
of
--
or
a
dollar
cost,
if
that
means
anything
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
not
so
much
that
there
are
–
well,
there
are
in
the
circumstances.
it's
a
standard
operating
procedure
in
this
industry
to
have
individual
wells
become
unprofitable.
this
is
nothing
new.
the
commission
for
years
has
worked
a
simple
procedure
for
these
wells
which
become
unprofitable
to
be
dropped
out.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
not
saying
there
is
any
justification
for
giving
a
higher
price
and
the
commission
hasn't
said
so.
it
said
what
clearly
isn't
the
justification
and
i
don't
want
to
give
any
false
impression
that
if
a
producer
can
show
that
his
prices
are
on
the
average,
30
cents
higher
than
other
people,
and
that
this
is
something
which
is
not
the
result
of
bad
management
or
shooting
for
the
moon
by
going
off
on
the
marginal
prospects,
hoping
it
will
strike
it
rich,
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
want
to
give
any
impression
that
anybody
who
really
has
high
prices
and
can
show
that
this
is
going
to
continue
to
have
high
prices
will
be
allowed
to
do
anything
more
than
gradually
get
out
of
the
business.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
group
of
producers
who
suggest
that
area
rates
will
swell
but
the
cost
is
not
a
good
basis
for
area
rates.
i
think
there's
great
balance
at
this
stage
of
area
rate
making,
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
at
all
for
the
commission
not
to
use
cost
as
a
basic
yardstick
in
determining
area
rates.
there
maybe
stages
once
you
have
the
cost
base
started
out
whereby,
as
economic
situations
change,
the
factors
other
than
cost
may
become
increasingly
more
important.
firstly,
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
would
have
been
appropriate
from
the
standpoint
of
making
sure
that
the
consumer
is
not
being
--
getting
--
paying
more
than
he
needs
to,
whereas
to
start
out
absent
of
cost
basis.
but
even
assuming
that
it
will
be
legally
possible,
obviously,
the
commission's
determination
to
use
cost
is
a
judgment
of
the
commission
which
a
very
heavy
burden
would
be
on
anybody
trying
to
offset.
and
certainly,
this
burden
hasn't
been
met
here.
as
usual,
i
find
my
time
is
running
and
therefore
i'm
not
going
to
go
in
my
argument
here
very
much
into
the
matter
which
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief
as
to
why
the
argument
that
there's
free
competition
in
this
industry.
and
that
that
alone
is
good
enough
to
justify,
relying
on
the
market
price
rather
than
a
cost
based
price
is
sufficient.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
although
there
are
a
lot
of
producers
in
any
field
and
they
compete
among
themselves
for
new
leases
that
there
isn't
a
type
of
price
competition
which
will
--
can
be
depended
upon
to
protect
the
public.
on
the
contrary,
the
history
of
pricing
in
permian
is
very
much
like
the
history
of
pricing
in
southern
louisiana
which
lead
this
court
in
catco
to
say
something
has
to
be
done
and
the
regulatory
agency
has
to
move
in.
the
reasons
for
this
aren't
obscure,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
el
paso
divestment
case,
the
way
this
business
operates
is
a
pipeline
will,
in
addition
to
its
usual
increments
of
gas,
every
once
in
a
while,
it's
making
a
big
new
sale
and
needs
a
lot
of
gas
quickly.
then
it
has
to
go
to
the
producers
in
the
particular
area
who
have
the
gas,
these
are
usually
a
few
producers,
they
obviously
can
--
as
the
record
here
indicates,
it
can
get
the
prices
up.
the
history
of
this
business
is
this
quasi
posted
price
business
that
i
mentioned
before.
all
other
prices
go
up
and
with
the
escalations
in
the
old
contracts
even
the
prices
for
flowing
gas
goes
up.
when
you
add
to
this,
the
fact
that
one
of
the
major
pipelines
in
the
permian
basin
and
the
one
which
broke
the
pipe
--
the
price
line
but
good
in
1960,
the
transwestern
pipeline
was
at
that
time
very
largely
owned
by
producers,
and
when
you
add
the
strange
absence
of
serious
participation
in
this
case
by
the
pipeline,
you'll
see
what's
going
on.
i
said
i
tell
you
why
the
pipelines
didn't
participate,
a
very
simple
answer.
the
pipelines
much
more
than
one
would
--
might
suspect
can
pass
on
a
higher
price
as
they
get
to
their
customers
is
particularly
true
in
this
case.
the
residential
consumer
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
captive
customer
who
can't
switch
back
and
forth.
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
we're
dealing
with
california
where
the
industrial
consumer
also
is
dependent
largely
on
gas,
price
competition
does
just
not
hold
down
the
prices
and
the
pipelines
as
a
result
relatively
disinterested.
the
other
argument
with
respect
to
don't
use
cost
or
rather
if
you
use
it,
use
it
as
a
very
minor
factor
is
a
little
different.
it
goes
on
this
basis.
there's
too
little
gas
being
discovered
to
meet
future
needs
and
even
under
the
commission's
pricing
system
we
can't
be
sure
that
there's
going
to
be
enough
gas
discovered
therefore
don't
use
cost
or
anything
else
to
really
put
much
of
a
lid
on
it.
the
fact
that
in
every
year,
not
only
through
this
record,
but
since
this
time,
reserves
at
it
have
been
more
in
production
and
the
fact
that
in
permian,
since
the
commission
in
1960
put
a
guideline
price
on
which
is
about
the
same
as
the
new
gas-well
pipes,
have
been
tremendous
development,
is
discounted
and
what
this
type
of
argument
talks
about
is
the
declining
reserves
to
production
ratio
nationally,
the
rp
ratio.
this
has
been
going
down,
it
certainly
has,
it
was
about
32
to
1
at
a
time
when
gas
was
a
waste
product
and
it
has
been
going
down
steadily
ever
since.
slower
but
still
steadily
and
it's
now
about
16.5
to
1
and
may
go
down
through.
the
commission
recognized
this
and
so
it
wasn't
disturbed
by
this,
that
it
was
far
from
clear
that
the
present
ratios
are
not
too
high
in
the
sense
of
--
in
the
economy
and
the
consumer
standpoint
requiring
present
consumers
to
pay
for
too
much
gas
for
the
future.
the
oil
industry
which
is
certainly
not
comparable
in
all
respects,
the
rp
ratio
there
is
leveled
off
at
about
11
to
1.
and
far
from
clear
that
something
similar
to
this
wouldn't
be
equally
good
in
the
gas
industry.
the
commission
hasn't
ignored
this
problem.
the
commission
in
fact
added
one
cent
to
the
e
and
d
allowance
to
provide
for
exploration
and
development
greater
than
the
current
figure
in
order
to
provide
for
further
advancement
in
exploration
and
development.
let
me
be
clear
about
this
one.
we're
fully
aware
of
our
--
that
our
obligations
to
the
gas
consumers
and
we
think
that
is
to
fix
prices
at
the
lowest
possible
level
consistent
with
a
healthy
industry
and
reasonable
profits
to
the
producers,
cannot
be
met
by
ignoring
the
long-term
interplay
of
the
factors
of
supply
and
demand.
we
shall
and
must
continue
to
watch
current
and
future
trends
on
the
production
side
and
to
the
extent
that
price
can
play
a
positive
role
area,
be
prepared
to
adjust
prices
for
future
vantages
of
gas
to
meet
current
conditions.
but
on
this
point,
let
me
read
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hope
case,
in
response
to
a
similar
claim
by
the
state
of
west
virginia.
we
have
set
production
cost
there.
tends
to
be
cost
for
the
individual
pipeline
but
the
point
is
the
same.
at
too
low
a
level
to
insure
there'd
be
adequate
production.
and
what
justice
douglas
said
in
that
case
and
we
thinks
it's
completely
applicable
here
is
the
following.
i'm
reading
from
320
u.s.
at
615,
if
in
the
light
of
experience,
they,
that
is
the
rates,
turn
out
to
be
inadequate
for
the
development
of
new
sources
of
supply,
the
doors
of
the
commission
are
open
for
increased
allowances.
this
is
not
an
order
for
all
time.
this
is
equally
applicable
here,
and
the
16
and
a
half
to
1
rp
ratio,
that
means,
there
is
proven
reserves,
admittedly
understated
as
to
the
actual
reserves,
but
proven
reserves
16
and
a
half
times
the
present
production
is
more
than
adequate
to
provide
lead
time
if
this
in
this
year
shows
that
something
should
be
done.
now,
let
me
turn
to
our
third
group
of
producer
arguments
who
accept
as
at
least
within
our
discretion
reluctantly,
tying
cost
--
tying
rates
to
cost
yardsticks.
that
they
argue
and
here
they're
joined
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
commission,
either
by
fixing
minimum
as
well
as
maximum
rates
or
by
raising
the
maximum
rates,
has
to
ensure
that
producers
as
a
group
will
recover
revenues
equal
to
their
average
costs.
and
the
edge
--
alleged
failure
of
the
commission
to
make
this
assurance
was
certainly
one
of
the
main
grounds
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
remanding
it
to
us
because
the
court
said
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
end
result
test
in
hope.
it
will
also
form
this
court's
basis
on
rehearing
for
saying
that
the
refunds
cannot
be
made
even
on
increased
rates
which
are
above
the
just
and
reasonable
ceiling
we
have
set
here.
unless
we
first
find
out
they're
not
offset
by
lower
rates
which
some
of
the
producers
are
voluntarily
agreed
to
in
their
context.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
this
end
result
test
of
hope
to
requiring
a
balancing
of
cost
with
expected
revenues.
it
reversed
the
commission
because
it
did
not
specify
the
total
revenues
which
the
producers
would
secure
on
the
established
rate.
if
you
remember
justice
stewart,
the
same
argument
was
made
last
year
in
the
chicago
northwestern
division
case.
and
also
because
the
revenues
would
necessarily
not
equal
cost
average
cost
to
the
extent
that
contractual
limitations
precluded
producers
from
filing
from
appropriate
ceilings.
the
commission
in
response
to
this
letter
claimed
expressly
denied
its
intent
to
match
jurisdictional
revenues
with
jurisdiction
cost.
and
what
it
said
was,
and
i'm
reading
from
our
record
1114d,
it
would
be
contrary
to
all
regulatory
principles
to
permit
prices
in
excess
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
certain
purchases
merely
because
other
sales
have
been
voluntarily
made
below
costs.
but
the
commission
went
on
to
make
clear
that
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
that
overall
producer
revenues
would
be
inadequate
for
the
maintenance
of
the
healthy
industry.
now
the
court
of
appeals
was
dissatisfied
with
this
latter
conclusion
because
it
felt
that
the
failure,
i'm
quoting
from
the
court,
the
failure
of
the
record
to
disclose
the
revenue
impact
of
the
adjustments
in
the
area
rates
to
reflect
quality
differentials.
as
i've
already
indicated
but
i'll
expand
upon
a
little
bit
here,
that
this
is
just
plain
wrong,
it
overlooks
the
finding
of
the
commission
on
this
point.
now,
let
me
explain
this
problem
and
i
think
the
court
was
confused.
there
isn't
any
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
don't
pretend
there
is
as
to
the
pipeline
cost
at
their
processing
plants
of
bringing
the
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
and
therefore,
since
the
commission
was
establishing
the
system
of
matching
the
individual
sale
to
its
quality,
it
was
necessary
to
provide
for
a
special
procedure
of
quality
statements
filed
by
the
producers
at
the
consultation
with
the
pipelines
with
respect
to
the
particular
discount
for
the
particular
sale
as
a
result
of
the
particular
processing
operations.
but
there
was
evidence.
there
was
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
approximate
overall
impact
of
the
quality
reduction.
what
was
this
evidence?
first
of
all,
there
was
evidence
based
upon
producer
cost
in
their
processing
claim
of
performing
the
same
functions
of
bringing
gas
up
to
the
pipeline
quality.
secondly,
there
was
an
evidence
of
certain
contractual
provisions
and
some
of
the
contracts
where
pipelines
expressly
provided
for
their
--
they
should
be
reimbursed
where
they
had
to
bring
gas
up
to
pipeline
quality.
and
third,
there
was
expert
testimony
based
on
these
facts
as
to
what
the
impact
would
be.
this
wasn't
something
the
commission
invented.
the
examiner
--
it's
--
in
his
decision
had
quantified
this
that
about
1
to
1
and
a
half
cents.
the
concurring
commissioner
said
1
to
1.7
cents.
and
the
commission
in
the
light
of
certain
adjustments
to
quality
which
it
made
that
the
producers'
behest
on
rehearing
found
that
the
range
of
this
quantity
discount
would
be
.7%
to
1.5%.
and
what
they
found
on
the
basis
of
the
record
actually
squares
with
these
quality
statements.
there
is
thus
no,
if
i
may
use
the
term
the
court
used,
there
is
no
revenue
deficiency.the
question
at
all
is
with
respect
to
quality
adjustments.
the
producers
aren't
going
to
receive
the
ceiling
price
which
we
have
set
for
pipeline
quality
gas
for
the
large
percentage
of
permian
gas
which
is
far
from
pipeline
quality.
but
this
was
exactly
what
the
commission
anticipated
whether
it
adopted
a
rate
of
return,
deliberately
set
to
take
into
account
the
quantified
risk
that
permian
gas
would
not
qualify
for
ceiling
prices.
now
let
me
get
back
to
the
other
aspect
of
this
problem.
this
relates
to
contract
pricings
made
by
various
producers
over
various
periods
of
time
by
which
they
agreed
in
selling
gas
to
the
various
pipeline
at
the
maximum
price
they
could
charge
at
a
given
moment
was
x
and
x
may,
and
is
in
certain
areas,
less
than
we
have
found
the
maximum
they
could
have
charged.
the
court
of
appeals
originally
seems
to
have
believed
that
we
were
under
an
obligation
to
take
care
of
these
contracts
by
setting
minimum
rates
which
would
aviate
the
overall
impact
of
these
limitations
on
filing
up
to
the
area
of
ceiling.
now
rehearing,
it
seems
to
have
also
suggested
that
maybe
instead
of
setting
minimum
rates,
we
could
simply
set
the
base
rate
higher,
similarly
to
negate
the
effect
of
these
contractual
limitations.
but
while
it
isn't
entirely
clear
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
should
do,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
of
either
respect.
now,
what
is
the
basis,
the
legal
basis
for
this
position?
essentially,
we
go
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
mobil
and
the
sierra
pacific
cases
at
350
u.s.
--
at
332
and
348.
now,
the
point
of
these
cases
which
of
course
billed
on
earlier
cases
in
the
railroad
and
natural
gas
fields,
state
natural
gas
law
field,
the
point
of
these
cases
is
that
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
automatically
supersede
freely
made
contracts
between
buyer
and
seller.
contractual
limitations,
not
only
cannot
be
circumvented
by
the
sellers
filing
a
rate
increase,
under
section
4
of
the
act,
that's
the
mobil
case.
but
as
justice
harlan
made
clear
in
the
sierra
pacific,
the
commission
itself
cannot
and
shouldn't
raise
a
rate
which
by
contrary,
the
seller
in
this
industry
has
set
at
a
lower
figure
than
he
could
have
charged
merely
in
order
to
enable
that
seller
to
return
--
earn
the
full
return
that
would
have
been
permissible.
what
justice
harlan
said
there,
the
test
he
said
we
had
to
apply
and
the
test
we're
–
or
if
you're
willing
to
apply
here
too
is
that
before
somebody
volunt
--
before
somebody
who
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
a
lower
rate
to
perform
this
service,
that
he
might
have
been
entitled
in
this
range
of
what's
in
the
public
interest.
it
must
be
demonstrated
and
here
i
am
quoting,
“that
the
rate
is
so
low
as
to
adversely
affect
the
public
interest”,
as
where
it
might
impair
the
financial
ability
of
the
public
utility
to
continue
its
service,
passed
on
other
consumers
in
excessive
burden
or
be
unduly
discriminatory.
and
nothing
is
in
the
sierra
case
as
we
read
suggest
that
the
decision
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
company
involved
could
--
without
a
similar
public
interest
showing,
charged
rates
on
other
sense
higher
than
otherwise
would
be
appropriate
on
these
sales
simply
to
make
up
for
the
loss
in
maximum
profits
who
doesn't
voluntarily
agree
to
bear.
on
the
contrary,
the
natural
gas
act
which
we
were
construing
here
today,
expressly
states
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
that
all
rates
and
charges
of
a
natural
gas
company
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
any
such
rate
or
charge
that
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
hereby
declared
to
be
unlawful.
and
this
court
in
the
tennessee
case,
at
371
u.s.
similarly
made
clear
that
losses
in
the
first
instance
do
not
justify
illegal
gains
in
the
other.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
certainly
do.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
people
who
charge
a
series
of
rates
don't
charge
as
to
one
rate.
have
rights
under
special
circumstances
whether
to
charge
the
less
than
the
full
rate
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
regulatory
cost,
so
you
wouldn't
get
--
you
would
allow
them
to
have.
the
fact
that
they
charged
less
than
what
they
might
have
got,
in
our
opinion,
and
as
we
read
sierra
and
other
cases,
does
not
justify
them
to
charge
more
than
is
the
appropriate
rate
whatever
that
may
be.
on
other
side,
they
cannot,
in
other
words
--
because
they
have
voluntarily
entered
into
an
agreement
to
charge
one
customer,
less
than
they
might
have
charged,
they
raise
the
rates
to
the
second
customer.
the
customer
is
entitled
to
have
his
rate
no
higher
than
what's
just
and
reasonable
taking
--
and
not
to
have
a
higher
than
the
normal
rate
because
the
company
has
entered
into
lower
sales
with
other
people.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
the
contract,
typically,
relies
for
not
only
initial
rate
but
certain
escalations
in
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
he
may
file
for
these
escalations
in
this
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
he
has
a
contractual
right
to
bring
it
up
to
the
rate,
yes
he
has
a
contractual
right
to
bring
up
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
there
are
renegotiations
between
the
pipelines
and
the
producers
of
contracts
which
now
prohibit
the
filing
for
the
area
rate,
under
our
system
this
would
not
have
to
be
--
this
renegotiation
could
take
place
and
they
could
file
them
because
there
would
be
no
contractual
innovation.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
necessarily
unless
there
were
some
consideration
for
this
that
we
would
look
at
the
pipeline
when
it
comes
up
for
a
rate
increase
we
might
very
well
ask
the
pipeline,
what
was
the
consideration
for
you
--
allowing
higher
rates
where
you
previously
bargained
to?
as
far
as
the
producer
is
concerned,
renegotiation
is
appropriate
and
it
was
renegotiated,
that
were
fine.
we're
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
pipelines
were
unwilling
to
renegotiate.
they
want
to
stick
with
their
bargain.
let
me
explain
what
the
problem
is,
it's
very,
very
clear
in
permian.
a
lot
of
the
very
low
rates
here
are
the
result
of
the
bargains
made
by
northern
natural
gas
company
with
some
producers.
now,
northern
has
got
the
benefit
of
these
bargains,
and
this
is
going
to
benefit
its
customers
in
the
midwest.
a
lot
of
the
higher
rates
which
were
subject
to
refunds
here,
subject
to
reduction
of
the
result
of
el
paso
agreeing
to
high
charges
in
part
to
get
rid
of
some
of
these
escalations
that
we
mentioned
in
its
raise.
now,
maybe
northern
is
going
to
allow
that
the
goodness
of
its
heart
because
it's
so
important
to
it,
agree
to
allow
these
rates
to
be
raised,
but
the
problem
really
is
el
paso.
el
paso's
customers
have
been
paying
these
rates
which
we
found
to
be
too
high,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
should
get
any
relief
for
it,
both
from
the
area
of
reductions
for
the
future
and
in
refunds
for
the
past.
don't
get
me
wrong,
we
believe
that
the
sierra
test
is
applicable
and
if
somebody
can
show
that
these
low
contract
rates
are
in
fact
inhibiting
the
industry
from
performing
its
functions,
not
only
to
itself
but
to
its
customers
then
obviously
there
is
justification
under
–
that's
it
the
appropriate
tests
for
raising
these
low
contract
rates.
but,
there
hasn't
been
any
such
showing.
with
respect
to
the
new
gas-well
gas,
the
gas
--
the
prices
we've
set
for
new
gas-well
gas
for
the
future
perfectly
clear
that
there
can't
be
–
there's
some
showing.
they're
under
no
contractual
innovations.
we
haven't
set
any.
they
can
contract
for
the
area
rate.
it's
conceivable
as
some
of
the
producers
point
out
that
despite
these
innovations,
various
sales
will
in
the
future
go
for
less
than
the
area
rate.
but
certainly
this
is
not
the
basis
for
our
fixing
the
new
gas-well
rate
at
some
arbitrary
higher
figure
to
take
care
of
this
situation.
with
respect
to
the
old
gas-well
gas
rate
and
the
oil-well
gas
which
is
tied
to
this,
the
continuing
operations
here
are
--
as
i've
indicated
before,
basically
a
relationship
of
the
continuing
production
cost.
and
we
don't
see
how
anybody
is
going
to
make
any
showing,
certainly
not
on
the
group
basis.
certainly
not
of
the
group
basis
that
if
these
rates
are
not
raised
and
they
continue
to
have
to
get
what
they
contracted
for
here
that
this
industry
is
going
to
be
adversely
affected
from
the
public
interest
in
any
respect.
now,
let
me
make
a
very
strong
caveat,
i
don't
think
the
industry
can
come
close
to
making
a
sierra
type
point
and
they
certainly
haven't
made
it
on
this
record.
i
can
conceive
money.
individual
producers
with
high
embedded
cost
or
other
special
problems
who
could
make
the
sierra
form.
i
can
conceive
of
an
individual
producer
who
is
in
the
problem
that
justice
fortas
mentioned
before
who's
got
an
unprofitable
sale
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest
to
allow
to
be
abandoned,
i
believe
they're
on
that
sale
or
another
sale
has
a
contractual
limitation
coming
in
and
saying,
“this
is
good
justification
for
allowing
me
to
raise
the
contractual
limitation
here”.
and
we
do
think
it's
possible
that
there
will
be
on
an
individual
basis
pursuant
for
the
special
exception
procedure,
individual
showings
as
to
why
some
are
all
--
low
contract
rate
should
be
raised.
but
we
don't
think
this
is
a
general
matter
and
we
don't
think
it's
anything
that
requires
as
the
court
did
a
remand
to
the
commission.
and
what
i
have
said
here
is
at
least
in
our
opinion
equally
applicable
to
the
refund
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
so,
and
what
i'm
saying
specifically
is
that,
there
may
very
well
be
situations,
individual
situations.
for
a
part
of
the
relief
that
somebody
makes
under
this
special
exception
thing
will
be
to
relieve
him
from
a
particular
low
contract
which
are
squeezing
him
and
making
it
difficult
for
him
to
perform
as
a
producer
performing
useful
content
in
this
industry.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
correct.
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
court's
opinion
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement
of
the
commission's
opinion
that
we
could
not
and
certainly
don't
have
to
commit
ourselves
in
advance
as
to
how
we
will
treat
individual
situations
which
necessarily
vary
from
case
to
case.
now,
to
go
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
think
you're
right
also.
i
think
this
certainly
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
said.
one
of
their
problems
with
our
special
exemption
procedures
is
just
--
they
said
you
haven't
spelled
it
out
sufficiently.
you
haven't
stated
in
greater
--
of
detail
as
to
what
type
of
things
will
entitle
people
to
special
relief.
as
i've
indicated
before
on
that,
i
think
we
spelled
it
out
as
adequately
as
is
possible
at
this
stage
of
area
rate
making
in
the
absence
of
any
claims
of
this
nature
at
this
day.
i
don't
think
--
i'm
sure
there
wouldn't
--
i
sympathize
with
the
court
of
appeals,
obviously
the
more
that
an
agency
can
spell
out
how
it
will
react
to
individual
request
for
special
relief,
the
more
it
can
do
so,
the
better.
but
we're
dealing
with
a
problem
where
you
only
don't
have
the
record
to
do
it.
we
don't
have
the
claims
before
us.
and
to
ask
for
the
specificity
that
the
court
wanted,
in
our
opinion,
is
certainly
not
legally
necessary
and
under
the
circumstances
here,
it's
just
impossible.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
really
haven't
the
vaguest
idea.
i
tried
to
figure
out
how
we
could
comply
with
that
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
and
i
frankly
haven't
the
slightest
idea
how
we
could
comply.
unfortunately,
my
time
is
going
pretty
fast,
i
do
want
to
say
on
the
refund
business.
if
i
indicated,
the
refunds
are
largely
to
el
paso
whose
under
an
obligation
to
flow
them
onto
their
customers,
a
large
percentage
of
the
low
price
contracts
are
normal.
that
shows
you
the
type
of
problem
it
is.
the
court
of
appeals
originally
believed
as
we
think
rightly
that
refunds
of
rates
which
these
people
have
been
allowed
under
the
act,
to
put
into
effect
and
charge
only
upon
the
agreement
that
they
would
pay
back
to
their
customers
if
they
were
found
to
be
high
--
have
to
be
on
an
individual
basis.
the
court
was
persuaded
on
rehearing
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
phillips
case,
the
wisconsin
case,
precluded
that
termination
and
that
there
had
to
be
a
more
general
balance.
now
this
is
a
misreading
of
phillips.
briefly
what
happens
in
phillips
was
this.
if
you
remember,
we
started
out
to
fix
phillips
rates
for
all
its
sales
throughout
the
united
states.
some
of
these
sales
were
much
higher
and
some
of
them
are
much
lower
than
the
average
--
and
the
average
cost.
this
isn't
surprising.
there
sales
involved
there
were
not
only
in
permian,
there
is
hugoton-anadarko
which
is
the
oldest
and
shallowest
field
in
the
unites
states.
there
were
in
southern
louisiana,
they're
all
over
the
continent.
the
commission
didn't
finish
that
up.
it
never
got
the
rate
design
part
of
the
phillips
case
in
which
it
went
through
the
exercise
of
determining
whether
some
of
these
high
sales
were
or
were
not
in
the
light
of
the
particular
circumstances
too
high.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
presumption
that
they
were
above
a
just
and
reasonable
standard
in
their
area
merely
because
they
were
higher
than
the
phillips
cost
statute.
what
the
commission
did
was,
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
go
through
this
exercise
and
with
respect
to
the
10(4)
(e)
increased
rate
filings
we
have.
it
isn't
worth
our
time
or
anybody's
time
to
make
these
allocations
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
and
the
court
in
affirming
us,
made
very
clear
that
it
was
limiting
us
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
justice
harlan's
decision
noted
that
we
had
in
the
subsequent
case
said
that
a
high
rate
isn't
necessarily
justified
merely
because
the
comparison
of
overall
costs
and
overall
revenues
were
balanced
out.
but
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
the
rate
wasn't
locked
in
as
it
was
in
phillips
and
as
they
are
not
here.
and
he
also
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
in
the
hunt
case,
this
rate
was
higher
than
that
area's
average,
analogous
to
the
situation
here.
and
he
distinguished
the
phillips
situation
on
that
basis.
and
we
think
that
this
is
all
what
phillips
really
stands
for
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
that
particular
case,
it
was
justifiable
for
the
commission
as
was
said,
it
wasn't
going
to
go
ahead
generally
with
this
allocation
to
refuse
to
make
it
for
these
10
sales
on
the
off
chance
that
a
few
of
the
high
sales
might
turn
out
to
be
more
than
just
and
reasonable.
certainly,
that's
not
the
present
situation.
in
the
brief
time,
before
i
have
to
sit
down
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
word.
the
commission
has
done
another
innovative
thing
in
this
proceeding.
at
least
it's
innovative
as
far
as
the
federal
power
commission
is
concerned,
and
that
is
the
establishment
of
a
moratorium
on
any
increased
sales
for
a
discrete
period
of
time.
the
commission
in
excess
of
precaution
because
this
was
the
first
case,
because
of
the
nature
of
area
rate
making
at
this
stage,
limited
this
moratorium
to
a
two-year
period
that
would
expire
on

but
this
is
an
important
question
for
future
cases
and
this
is
by
no
means
moot
because
there
are
a
number
of
sales
increased
during
this
moratorium
period.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
works
out
to
a
little
more
than
two
years
in
this
case.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
the
two-year
moratorium
is
the
minimum
or
maximum
that
we
could
have
done,
and
what
we
chose
under
the
facts
of
this
case
of
the
status
of
area
rate
making
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
effect
of
that
is
for
the
commission
--
by
a
commission
act
to
eliminate
escalation
clauses
of
--
for
that
period.
this
isn't
a
unique
matter
as
you
remember
under
our
certificate
authority.
we
have
similarly
wiped
out
escalation
clauses
for
a
discrete
period.
and
this
court
has
upheld
this
authority
both
in
the
hunt
case
with
respect
to
temporary
certificates
and
the
callery
case
with
respect
to
permanent
certificates.
and
more
important
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
most
cases
by
the
way,
justice
harlan,
as
in
this
case,
we
haven't
precluded
all
rate
findings.
we've
allowed
them
up
to
the
ceiling
so
that
anybody
who
has
a
limitation
that
is
eliminated
during
this
period
and
at
least
$3
million
of
it
--
it
have
here
--
they
can
try.
we're
only
talking
about
increases
over
the
ceiling.
and
the
point
i
--
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
not
only
that
this
has
been
allowed
for
our
commission
by
the
certificate
authority
of
section
7,
but
we
think
that
it
is
equally
permissible
under
the
provision
of
section
5
of
the
act
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
which
provides
that
the
commission
shall
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
to
be
thereafter
observed
and
enforced
and
to
fix
the
same
by
order.
this
is
exactly
the
same
language
which
this
court
found
over
20
years
ago
in
the
u.s.
v.
corrick
case
at
298
justified
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
refusing
to
consider
rate
increase
filings
filed
under
an
identical
statute
in
section
4
of
our
act.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
when
the
commission,
in
a
rate
case
of
this
nature,
not
merely
responds
to
allowing
company
made
rates
to
go
into
effect.
but
where
the
commission
has
done
the
legislative
job
that
under
this
type
of
language,
the
commission's
action
in
effect,
justice
harlan,
takes
the
place
of
contractual
limitations
on
section
4
that
we
were
talking
about
in
the
mobil
case.
and
we
think
that
the
same
situation
here
certainly
justified
on
the
record
on
this
proceeding.
if
you
don't
mind,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
limited
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
let
me
take
care
of
couple
of
minor
matters.
there
were
some
statement
yesterday
by
texas
and
new
mexico
that
we
had
excluded
the
evidence
they
submitted.
the
attorney
generals
were
in
error
there.
we
did
not
exclude
the
evidence.
in
fact,
some
of
the
evidence
is
in
the
joint
appendix
here,
extracts
from
it.
it
was
admitted
into
the
record
and
was
considered.
we
did
reach
the
results
that
they
wanted
but
there's
no
exclusion
problem
involved.
now,
let
me
take
up
the
problem
which
i
did
not
take
up
in
my
initial
argument
which
was
raised
by
counsel
for
bass
yesterday
and
that
is
the
argument
that
the
commission
ignored
some
very
substantial
expenses
which
are
born
by
the
plant
sellers,
the
producers
who
purchase
on
--
normally
on
percentage
contracts
from
producers
in
the
field
gathered,
process
and
then
sell
at
the
tailgate
of
the
plant
and
the
argument
made
yesterday
was
--
that
it
was
outrageous
with
the
commission
to
fix
a
price
for
gas
at
the
tailgate
of
a
plant
after
gathering
and
processing
which
was
the
same
as
the
price
of
fixed
for
gas-well
gas
in
the
field.
now,
obviously
whether
the
commission
has
properly
or
improperly
decided
every
issue
here,
it
isn't
foolish
and
it
didn't
overlook
this
very
major
problem.
their
estimates
can
be
made
many
ways
but
probably
as
much
time
was
spent
on
cost
of
gasoline
plants,
so-called
gasoline
plants
in
this
record
as
any
other.
that
the
examiner
discusses
this
matter
in
great
detail
in
his
opinion
at
pages
226
to
231,
where
he
explains
why
despite
all
these
costing,
he
thinks
it
make
sense
to
price
it
on
a
value
basis
which
after
all
is
exactly
what's
happening
in
this
industry.
they
have
in
fact
sold
at
the
same
prices
roughly
as
the
price
of
the
pipelines
play
at
the
well
head
for
gas-well
gas.
and
at
pages
328
to
341,
if
you
want
to
go
through
a
very
interesting
exercise,
he
goes
into
great
depths
on
the
costing.
because
both
the
commission
and
the
examiner
in
coming
to
the
eventual
conclusion
that
an
exact
cost
involves
just
too
many
allocations
to
be
exact.
i've
done
so
only
in
the
light
of
a
recognition
that
they
were
not
by
so
doing
giving
too
little
for
these
various
expenses.
and
let
me
briefly
read
you
what
the
commission
said
in
response
to
bass'
arguments
or
with
similar
argument
very
point
on
rehearing
and
i'm
reading
from
1116
(d)
of
the
record.
they
say,
"it
has
been
stated
in
the
applications
for
rehearing
of
several
producer
respondents
that
the
price
of
residue
gas,
derived
from
casinghead
gas
should
be
fixed
at
a
higher
price
because
the
record
would
contain
evidence
which
would
establish
this
cost
for
the
level
above
the
14.5
cents
per
mcf
based
on
gas
well
it
cost".
the
record
does
not
support
this
argument.
on
the
contrary,
well
a
precise
cost
computation
of
residue
gas
cannot
be
made
with
sufficient
assurance
of
accuracy
sure
was
a
basis
for
fixing
prices.
the
evidence
demonstrates
the
cost
of
residue
gas
is
lower
than
the
cost
of
flowing
gas-well
gas.
it
reflects
in
the
evidence
and
then
they
go
on
to
discuss
certain
evidentiary
matters
which
had
been
raised
and
which
they
disagree
with.
now
this
is
not
at
all
the
picture
that
you
got
yesterday.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
this
further.
we've
discussed
it
pages
157
to
159
of
our
brief.
briefly,
let
me
refer
to
another
argument
made
by
counsel
for
bass
yesterday.
this
was
the
procedural
argument
with
respect
to
equality.
that
equality
wasn't
in
this
case.
very
difficult
point
it
seems
to
us
because
we
can't
quite
see
how
you
could
have
an
area
case
where
you
don't
consider
quality.
what
--
in
general
let
me
refer
you
here
if
i
may
to
pages
154
to
155
of
our
brief
and
particularly
to
the
statement
why
the
producers
when
they
try
to
tie
a
rule
making
proceeding
on
quality
to
the
permian
basin
decision,
what
they
said
was
not
that
it
was
in
the
permian
basin
case
but
they
said
was
and
i'm
quoting
from
there
--
to
my
brief
and
this
is
a
quote,
“the
producers
in
the
permian
basin
proceeding
have
introduced
evidence
regarding
quality
standards
in
price
differentials
and
planned
to
introduced
additional
evidence
on
such
points
when
appropriate”.
now,
what
the
commission
did
was
to
say
that
it
wasn't
going
to
in
the
light
of
those
statements
try
a
general
quality
thing
into
this
proceeding
that
nobody
thought
up
until
much
later
the
quality
wasn't
an
issue.
now
justice
fortas,
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
i
agree
with
the
counsel
for
socony
that
it
is
not
only
useful
from
the
standpoint
of
--
i
think
the
entire
industry
for
this
court
to
decide
the
moratorium
issue
but
that
--
this
moratorium
issue
is
not
moot.
the
technical
reason
for
moratorium
issue
is
not
moot
is
because
moratorium
in
a
state,
we
haven't
been
able
when
people
filed
increase
which
would
have
been
subject
to
the
moratorium
to
not
let
them
go
into
effect.
but
we
have
assumed
that
the
court
stay
on
the
moratorium
like
everything
else
were
subject
to
the
final
action
of
that
court
and
this
court.
and
the
commission
has
consisted
with
in
allowing
these
increases
to
go
into
effect
and
they're
clear
that
they
were
going
into
effect
subject
to
the
final
outcome
of
this
case.
so,
there's
considerable
amount
of
money
which
means
that
the
problem
is
not
moot.
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
went
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
would
result
in
refunds
for
those
producers
who
pursuant
to
the
stay
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
and
filed
increases
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
which
wouldn't
have
been
(voice
overlap).
that's
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
exactly.
i'll
give
you
something
back.
there
was
one
argument
here
which
we
don't.
i
won't
go
any
great
length.
that
is
the
argument
about
the
last
“clean
rate”
problem.
i
wouldn't
even
attempt
to
describe
it.
it
was
mentioned
in
some
of
the
briefs.
it
was
mentioned
by
counsel
for
mobil
yesterday.
i
don't
--
they
want
to
decide
it
in
may
but
the
fact
is
on
this
one,
the
commission
expressly
refrained
from
deciding
it.
it
has
not
been
decided
by
the
commission.
at
the
time
of
the
commission's
decision
it
wasn't
clear
whether
it
was
a
real
problem
or
not
and
we
said
we'd
handle
it
when
we
got
it.
so,
this
is
not
something
which
is
the
part
of
the
commission
decision.
now,
briefly
on
the
problem
that
mr.
gilliam
was
speaking
this
morning,
speaking
to
this
morning.
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
justice
white
that
there
is
a
finding.
the
finding
is
that
1115
(d)
of
the
record
and
what
the
finding
is
there's
a
longer
paragraph
on
the
matter.
it
says,
with
the
charges
--
changes
we
have
made
with
respect
to
quality
standards,
the
average
adjustments
for
gas-well
gas
will
range
from
0.7
to
1.5
reduced
by
the
additional
revenue
for
plant
liquids
and
the
effect
of
the
btu
adjustment.
there
is
evidence
upon
that
--
which
that
is
based
on
--
it
is
evidenced
which
mr.
gilliam
doesn't
think
is
good
evidence.
this
evidence
we
think
is
clearly
good
enough
evidence
as
well
as
the
exporter.
and
the
evidentiary
references,
i
will
not
labor
the
court
with
but
they
are
cited
in
our
brief
in
the
footnote
15
at
pages
142
to
143
of
our
brief.
finally,
like
my
client
put
back
on
the
track
what
i
think
mr.
gilliam's
argument
comes
down
to.
i
don't
think
once
we
get
out
of
this
morass
of
quality
that
this
is
a
real
problem.
there
is
a
real
problem.
what
they
are
really
saying,
they
phrased
it,
what
mr.
gilliam
did
this
morning,
in
terms
of
letting
us
have
the
opportunity
to
earn
this
cost
based
standard
price.
but
what
this
really
boils
down
to
is
saying,
set
your
rates
to
guarantee
that
the
--
we
will
earn
these
revenues
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
on
a
number
of
our
sales
previously
contracted
to
charge
less.
and
that
is
what
the
problem
is
really
all
about
on
the
so-called
revenue
deficiency
argument
and
i
think
or
as
i
know
this
is
something
that
i
hope
i
explain
in
some
detail
on
tuesday.
oh,
may
i
say
one
more
word
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
lack
of
material
in
the
briefs
on
some
of
the
costing
matters
which
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
get
to.
we
are
asking
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning
that
the
court
affirmed
the
commission
on
all
of
the
case.
we
hope
that
our
brief
has
taken
care
of
the
matter
and
we
certainly
hope
that
the
result
of
this
case
would
be
a
full
affirmation
of
the
commission
decision.
so,
we
can
proceed
with
the
difficult
task
of
finishing
up
this
area
rate
making
process.
