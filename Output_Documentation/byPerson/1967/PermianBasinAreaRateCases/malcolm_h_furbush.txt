mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company,
one
of
the
california
distributors
that
had
been
referred
to
here
today.
we
participated
in
this
case
before
the
commission
because
we
were
convinced
that
a
price
had
to
come
out
of
this
decision
which
would
be
adequate,
but
no
higher
than
adequate
to
bring
forth
the
supplies
of
gas
that
are
required
by
the
consumers
in
our
area.
now,
that
statement
which
i
just
made,
the
price
which
is
adequate
and
no
higher
than
adequate
or
no
higher
than
necessary
is
really
a
statement
of
the
function
which
price
plays
in
our
basic
economic
system.
and
we
approach
this
case
from
that
point
of
view
and
retained
economist
as
commission
counsel
has
described
to
you
this
morning,
to
help
us
make
our
presentation.
and
they,
on
their
review
of
basic
economic
law
concluded
that
that
is
just
what
should
be
done
here.
we
should
seek
that
price.
now,
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
the
price
that
is
as
high
and
no
higher
than
necessary
to
bring
forth
the
required
supplies.
parenthetically,
i
might
say
that
the
major
producers
interestingly
enough
adopt
the
same
standard
before
the
commission.
but
the
dispute
was,
what
evidence
do
you
use?
what
you
utilize
to
determine
that
price?
our
economist
told
us
and
told
the
commission
to
a
testimony
that
such
a
price
cannot
be
determined
without
some
reference
to
cost.
some
reference
to
cost.
and
also
that
price
can
only
perform
that
function
of
eliciting
supply
in
respect
to
such
supplies
as
will
be
responsive
to
price.
and
the
history
of
the
industry
was
such
that
gas
had
not
historically
been
responsible
to
the
--
did
not
respond
to
the
price
of
gas
because
gas
was
historically
a
byproduct
found
in
the
search
for
oil
and
produced
in
conjunction
with
the
production
of
oil
and
thereby
controlled
by
the
demand
for
oil.
and
that
therefore
price
will
not
perform
that
function,
but
with
the
advent
of
the
directionality
ability
of
the
commission
--
of
the
producers,
price
could
then
perform
that
function.
however,
recognizing
as
the
commission
recognized
and
as
the
court,
and
as
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
bulk
of
the
flowing
gas
supplies
were
found
as
a
result
of
the
search
for
oil
and
as
a
byproduct
of
that
search,
it
was
therefore
in
economic
terms
fairly
clear
that
paying
an
incentive
price,
a
high
price
necessary
to
bring
forth
new
gas-well
discoveries
would
not
be
necessary
in
respect
to
that
flowing
gas.
and
as
a
consequence,
our
economist
suggested
that
that
price
need
only
be
one
that
was
fair
and
reasonable
and
the
price
will
not
perform
the
function
which
we
had
assigned
to
it.
now
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
discussion
today
and
you
will
certainly
hear
more
tomorrow
on
costs.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
today
about
cost
as
i
take
it
from
the
proper
context
of
this
case.
now,
and
i'll
have
to
--
could
i
address
for
a
moment
to
talk
about
what
we're
regulating
hereto.
what
is
being
regulated
is
price.
the
producers
aren't
being
regulated.
the
producer
is
free
to
go
out
and
search
throughout
the
nation
for
gas
or
for
oil
and
do
whatever
he
wants
with
the
funds
that
he
gets
from
the
sale
of
the
gas.
he
may
engage
in
as
much
production
as
he
wants
to
when
he
--
and
as
much
exploration.
and
when
he
finds
gas,
he
can
sell
it
anywhere
he
wants.
he
can
sell
it
in
the
intrastate
market
and
if
he
sells
it
in
intrastate
market,
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
it.
and
it
is
only
if
he
sells
it
into
the
interstate
market
for
resale,
that
his
sale
becomes
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
hence
to
regulation.
now,
the
record
clearly
demonstrates
in
this
case
that
insofar
as
permian
gas
is
concerned,
50%
of
it
is
consumed
intrastate,
50%.
and
so
we're
talking
about
only
50%
of
the
gas
in
the
permian
basin
which
goes
into
the
interstate
market
which
is
subject
to
sale.
now,
with
that
thought
in
mind,
let's
go
back
to
cost
as
it
is
used
in
this
proceeding
and
talk
about
cost
of
service
for
a
moment.
now,
cost
of
service
applied
to
a
producer
does
not
mean
the
cost
of
gas
which
is
subject
to
that
price
order.
it
means
the
cost
of
engaging
in
the
exploration
development,
production
and
sale
of
gas
as
the
producing
industry
engaged
in
that
business.
as
it
engaged
in
the
business,
now
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
well,
at
4.08
cents
of
the
cost
of
flowing
gas
is
represented
by
exploration.
now
it
--
so
if
we
take
--
well
it's
at
least,
say
around
30%.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
at
least
30%
of
the
cost.
the
highest
of
course
--
highest
element
is
in
the
--
is
in
return.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
return
allowance.
now,
this
4.08
cents
representing
exploration
in
the
flowing
gas
here,
remembering
now
all
along
that
this
flowing
gas
cost
is
of
gas-well
gas
which
the
commission
said
and
the
highest
cost
of
any
of
the
types
of
gas
which
were
being
subject
to
the
regulation.
but
that
cost
study
included
4.08
cents
for
exploration.
now
you
know
what
that
means,
that
means
it
includes
for
dry
holes,
geological
and
geophysical
expenses,
delayed
rentals,
abandoned
leases,
all
of
the
expenses
of
a
non-productive
nature.
now,
that
is
not
the
exploration
cost
which
resulted
in
the
gas
that
was
flowing
during
1960.
that
was
the
exploration
cost
which
was
incurred
during
the
year
1960
under
the
exploration
programs
conducted
during
that
year
which,
however,
to
get
the
4.08
was
assigned
to
production
during
that
year.
and
what
does
this
mean?
this
means
that
the
costs
of
exploration
which
the
record
demonstrates
resulted
in
the
finding
on
an
average
of
138%
of
production,
138%
of
production.
the
cost
of
that
are
included
in
the
flowing
gas
cost.
now,
immediately,
we
harkened
back
these
overall
traditional
uses
of
public
utility
regulation
in
the
hope
case
itself,
don't
we?
and
what
do
we
find
there?
the
great
question
was
whether
or
not
original
cost
should
be
used,
the
commission
used,
employed
for
fair
value
which
is
just
replacement
cost.
so
what
do
we
have
here?
we're
having
that
4.08
cents
per
mcf
not
only
the
replacement
cost
of
the
gas
produced
during
that
year,
and
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all,
but
the
amount
of
money
necessary
for
the
producers
to
find
38%
more
to
increase
their
inventory
by
38%
more
than
they
produced
during
that
year.
now,
we
can
also
harken
back
the
hope
and
the
quotation
in
hope
about
--
well,
from
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
to
the
effect
that
a
producer
embarking
upon
a
wasting
asset
business
or
a
regulated
entity
embarking
for
the
wasting
asset
business
has
no
constitutional
right
to
have
more
at
the
end
of
that
business
than
he
had
at
the
beginning
of
that
business.
now,
here,
we
have
at
the
end
of
the
business,
the
producer
is
going
to
have
a
138%
more
than
he
had
when
he
started.
now,
we
don't
object
to
the
inclusion
of
that
extra
amount
which
if
you
want
to
compute
it,
138%
and
you
go
through
all
the
mathematical
maneuvers
applying
that
to
4.08
cents,
you
come
up
with
1.11
cents
per
mcf
which
i
classify
as
a
cushion
against
confiscation.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
that
is
the
amount
of
the
exploration
expenditure
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
--
in
the
flowing
gas
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
38%
over
simply
replacing
the
gas
produced.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
right,
right.
its
1.11
of
the
4.08.
now
in
the
price
for
new
a
non-associated
gas,
it's
clearly
stated
1.11
cents
per
mcf
was
provided
for
increased
exploration
activity.
now
we
subscribed
to
the
proposition
that
this
should
be
included
but
we
do
so
recognizing
that
we
are
doing
it
for
economic
reasons
in
the
hope
that
the
industry
would
utilize
these
funds
being
supplied
in
this
manner
to
acquire
reserves
which
it
is
hoped
by
us,
will
find
their
way
into
the
interstate
market.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
absolutely
not
your
honor.
they're
not
compelled
at
all.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
your
honor,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
just
switch
it
the
other
way
around.
i
wish
i
could
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
but
that
--
i
did
not
mean
that.
the
1.11
cents
or
1.12
in
the
case
of
the
flowing
and
1.1
in
the
case
of
the
new
is
that
which
is
being
supplied
for
public
policy.
the
remainder
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
right.
now,
let's
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
that's
right.
it's
replacing
--
it's
not
the
original
cost.
it's
the
replacement
of
the
gas
and
as
we
recognized
that
insofar
as
the
casinghead
gas
is
concerned,
oil-well
gas,
well,
you're
replacing
it
with
a
new
and
much
higher
cost
--
form
of
gas
than
what
was
originally
discovered.
now,
if
you
would
indulge
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
get
a
little
legalist
here
if
i
might.
i
don't
think
there's
any
concept
at
all
such
as
group
confiscation.
i
can't
read
that
in
our
constitution.
there
is
obviously
confiscation
of
the
individual.
and
so
you
really
don't
get
to
the
question
of
confiscation
until
you
see
what
happens
to
the
individual
when
he
comes
up
and
claims
that
he
--
his
property
is
being
confiscated
but
for
the
purpose
of
my
discussion
here
to
point
out
that
there
is
this
great
question
against
confiscation,
i
like
to
look
on
this
situation
as
being
(inaudible)
that
the
just
considerate
producer
having
the
cost
experience
that
was
employed
in
the
yardsticks
â€“
the
yardstick
cost.
and
then
we
see
whether
or
not
his
property
would
be
confiscated
on
the
basis
of
the
yardstick
cost
that
were
employed.
and
in
that
context,
is
where
i
talk
about
the
confiscation
and
i
say
that
there
we
have
right
off
the
top
of
this,
over
a
cent
cushion
against
confiscation.
and
as
i
say,
we
supported
the
inclusion
of
this
but
we
supported
for
these
other
reasons.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes.
we're
talking
--
the
yardstick
cost
is
what
we
referred
to
as
the
average.
we
can
call
it
the
average.
you
can
call
it
an
adequate
sample.
you
can
call
it
whatever
you
want.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
no.
no,
there
isn't.
but
then
should
that
bother
us
really
at
all.
you
know
the
constitution
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes.
well,
no
it
doesn't
--
but
you
know,
the
constitution
does
provide
for
bankruptcy
legislation
as
i
understand
it.
and
so
even
in
those
early
days,
it
was
recognized
that
in
our
economic
system,
there
are
going
to
be
some
fatalities.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
well
that
--
that's
right.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
would
like
it
your
honor.
now,
the
commission
as
has
been
pointed
out
several
times
today
employed
in
this
--
as
its
yardstick,
this
cost
of
gas
to
which
i
had
referenced
which
had
this
cushion
end
of
one
--
of
over
one
cent.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
recognized
as
being
the
highest
cost
gas
which
was
being
costed
by
the
participants
in
the
proceedings.
and
the
commission
referring
to
cost
of
casinghead
gas
said
that
it
could
not
be
accurately
determined.
and
one
of
the
criticisms
which
it
leveled
against
it
was
that
any
method
of
costing
casinghead
gas,
gas
that
comes
along
with
oil
which
allocates
to
that
gas
a
significant
or
substantial
amount
for
exploration,
one
was
found
as
a
byproduct
of
oil,
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
now,
that's
the
finding
of
the
commission
and
that
is
the
context
in
which
the
commission
was
criticizing
the
cost
studies
in
the
record
relative
to
casinghead
gas.
but
the
commission
also
said
in
recognizing
that
will
be
sold,
that
even
though
there
were
cost
studies
of
casinghead
gas
in
the
record
which
under
this
finding
would
still
be
overstated.
that
even
those
cost
studies
were
less
than
the
cost
yardstick
employed
by
the
commission.
now
this
being
so,
we
submit
that
during
--
when
you
hear
during
the
course
of
this
argument
references
to
cost
that
you
keep
in
mind
that
the
cost
which
was
referred
to
by
the
commission,
the
yardstick
costs
which
were
used
and
employed
in
the
development
of
the
commission
prices
were
costs
which
not
only
had
this
cushion
against
confiscation,
but
were
also
the
highest
cost
which
the
commission
felt
that
it
could
employ.
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company,
one
of
the
california
distributors
that
had
been
referred
to
here
today.
we
participated
in
this
case
before
the
commission
because
we
were
convinced
that
a
price
had
to
come
out
of
this
decision
which
would
be
adequate,
but
no
higher
than
adequate
to
bring
forth
the
supplies
of
gas
that
are
required
by
the
consumers
in
our
area.
now,
that
statement
which
i
just
made,
the
price
which
is
adequate
and
no
higher
than
adequate
or
no
higher
than
necessary
is
really
a
statement
of
the
function
which
price
plays
in
our
basic
economic
system.
and
we
approach
this
case
from
that
point
of
view
and
retained
economist
as
commission
counsel
has
described
to
you
this
morning,
to
help
us
make
our
presentation.
and
they,
on
their
review
of
basic
economic
law
concluded
that
that
is
just
what
should
be
done
here.
we
should
seek
that
price.
now,
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
the
price
that
is
as
high
and
no
higher
than
necessary
to
bring
forth
the
required
supplies.
parenthetically,
i
might
say
that
the
major
producers
interestingly
enough
adopt
the
same
standard
before
the
commission.
but
the
dispute
was,
what
evidence
do
you
use?
what
you
utilize
to
determine
that
price?
our
economist
told
us
and
told
the
commission
to
a
testimony
that
such
a
price
cannot
be
determined
without
some
reference
to
cost.
some
reference
to
cost.
and
also
that
price
can
only
perform
that
function
of
eliciting
supply
in
respect
to
such
supplies
as
will
be
responsive
to
price.
and
the
history
of
the
industry
was
such
that
gas
had
not
historically
been
responsible
to
the
--
did
not
respond
to
the
price
of
gas
because
gas
was
historically
a
byproduct
found
in
the
search
for
oil
and
produced
in
conjunction
with
the
production
of
oil
and
thereby
controlled
by
the
demand
for
oil.
and
that
therefore
price
will
not
perform
that
function,
but
with
the
advent
of
the
directionality
ability
of
the
commission
--
of
the
producers,
price
could
then
perform
that
function.
however,
recognizing
as
the
commission
recognized
and
as
the
court,
and
as
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
bulk
of
the
flowing
gas
supplies
were
found
as
a
result
of
the
search
for
oil
and
as
a
byproduct
of
that
search,
it
was
therefore
in
economic
terms
fairly
clear
that
paying
an
incentive
price,
a
high
price
necessary
to
bring
forth
new
gas-well
discoveries
would
not
be
necessary
in
respect
to
that
flowing
gas.
and
as
a
consequence,
our
economist
suggested
that
that
price
need
only
be
one
that
was
fair
and
reasonable
and
the
price
will
not
perform
the
function
which
we
had
assigned
to
it.
now
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
discussion
today
and
you
will
certainly
hear
more
tomorrow
on
costs.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
today
about
cost
as
i
take
it
from
the
proper
context
of
this
case.
now,
and
i'll
have
to
--
could
i
address
for
a
moment
to
talk
about
what
we're
regulating
hereto.
what
is
being
regulated
is
price.
the
producers
aren't
being
regulated.
the
producer
is
free
to
go
out
and
search
throughout
the
nation
for
gas
or
for
oil
and
do
whatever
he
wants
with
the
funds
that
he
gets
from
the
sale
of
the
gas.
he
may
engage
in
as
much
production
as
he
wants
to
when
he
--
and
as
much
exploration.
and
when
he
finds
gas,
he
can
sell
it
anywhere
he
wants.
he
can
sell
it
in
the
intrastate
market
and
if
he
sells
it
in
intrastate
market,
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
it.
and
it
is
only
if
he
sells
it
into
the
interstate
market
for
resale,
that
his
sale
becomes
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
hence
to
regulation.
now,
the
record
clearly
demonstrates
in
this
case
that
insofar
as
permian
gas
is
concerned,
50%
of
it
is
consumed
intrastate,
50%.
and
so
we're
talking
about
only
50%
of
the
gas
in
the
permian
basin
which
goes
into
the
interstate
market
which
is
subject
to
sale.
now,
with
that
thought
in
mind,
let's
go
back
to
cost
as
it
is
used
in
this
proceeding
and
talk
about
cost
of
service
for
a
moment.
now,
cost
of
service
applied
to
a
producer
does
not
mean
the
cost
of
gas
which
is
subject
to
that
price
order.
it
means
the
cost
of
engaging
in
the
exploration
development,
production
and
sale
of
gas
as
the
producing
industry
engaged
in
that
business.
as
it
engaged
in
the
business,
now
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
well,
at
4.08
cents
of
the
cost
of
flowing
gas
is
represented
by
exploration.
now
it
--
so
if
we
take
--
well
it's
at
least,
say
around
30%.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
at
least
30%
of
the
cost.
the
highest
of
course
--
highest
element
is
in
the
--
is
in
return.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
return
allowance.
now,
this
4.08
cents
representing
exploration
in
the
flowing
gas
here,
remembering
now
all
along
that
this
flowing
gas
cost
is
of
gas-well
gas
which
the
commission
said
and
the
highest
cost
of
any
of
the
types
of
gas
which
were
being
subject
to
the
regulation.
but
that
cost
study
included
4.08
cents
for
exploration.
now
you
know
what
that
means,
that
means
it
includes
for
dry
holes,
geological
and
geophysical
expenses,
delayed
rentals,
abandoned
leases,
all
of
the
expenses
of
a
non-productive
nature.
now,
that
is
not
the
exploration
cost
which
resulted
in
the
gas
that
was
flowing
during
1960.
that
was
the
exploration
cost
which
was
incurred
during
the
year
1960
under
the
exploration
programs
conducted
during
that
year
which,
however,
to
get
the
4.08
was
assigned
to
production
during
that
year.
and
what
does
this
mean?
this
means
that
the
costs
of
exploration
which
the
record
demonstrates
resulted
in
the
finding
on
an
average
of
138%
of
production,
138%
of
production.
the
cost
of
that
are
included
in
the
flowing
gas
cost.
now,
immediately,
we
harkened
back
these
overall
traditional
uses
of
public
utility
regulation
in
the
hope
case
itself,
don't
we?
and
what
do
we
find
there?
the
great
question
was
whether
or
not
original
cost
should
be
used,
the
commission
used,
employed
for
fair
value
which
is
just
replacement
cost.
so
what
do
we
have
here?
we're
having
that
4.08
cents
per
mcf
not
only
the
replacement
cost
of
the
gas
produced
during
that
year,
and
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all,
but
the
amount
of
money
necessary
for
the
producers
to
find
38%
more
to
increase
their
inventory
by
38%
more
than
they
produced
during
that
year.
now,
we
can
also
harken
back
the
hope
and
the
quotation
in
hope
about
--
well,
from
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
to
the
effect
that
a
producer
embarking
upon
a
wasting
asset
business
or
a
regulated
entity
embarking
for
the
wasting
asset
business
has
no
constitutional
right
to
have
more
at
the
end
of
that
business
than
he
had
at
the
beginning
of
that
business.
now,
here,
we
have
at
the
end
of
the
business,
the
producer
is
going
to
have
a
138%
more
than
he
had
when
he
started.
now,
we
don't
object
to
the
inclusion
of
that
extra
amount
which
if
you
want
to
compute
it,
138%
and
you
go
through
all
the
mathematical
maneuvers
applying
that
to
4.08
cents,
you
come
up
with
1.11
cents
per
mcf
which
i
classify
as
a
cushion
against
confiscation.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
that
is
the
amount
of
the
exploration
expenditure
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
--
in
the
flowing
gas
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
38%
over
simply
replacing
the
gas
produced.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
right,
right.
its
1.11
of
the
4.08.
now
in
the
price
for
new
a
non-associated
gas,
it's
clearly
stated
1.11
cents
per
mcf
was
provided
for
increased
exploration
activity.
now
we
subscribed
to
the
proposition
that
this
should
be
included
but
we
do
so
recognizing
that
we
are
doing
it
for
economic
reasons
in
the
hope
that
the
industry
would
utilize
these
funds
being
supplied
in
this
manner
to
acquire
reserves
which
it
is
hoped
by
us,
will
find
their
way
into
the
interstate
market.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
absolutely
not
your
honor.
they're
not
compelled
at
all.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
your
honor,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
just
switch
it
the
other
way
around.
i
wish
i
could
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
but
that
--
i
did
not
mean
that.
the
1.11
cents
or
1.12
in
the
case
of
the
flowing
and
1.1
in
the
case
of
the
new
is
that
which
is
being
supplied
for
public
policy.
the
remainder
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
right.
now,
let's
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
that's
right.
it's
replacing
--
it's
not
the
original
cost.
it's
the
replacement
of
the
gas
and
as
we
recognized
that
insofar
as
the
casinghead
gas
is
concerned,
oil-well
gas,
well,
you're
replacing
it
with
a
new
and
much
higher
cost
--
form
of
gas
than
what
was
originally
discovered.
now,
if
you
would
indulge
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
get
a
little
legalist
here
if
i
might.
i
don't
think
there's
any
concept
at
all
such
as
group
confiscation.
i
can't
read
that
in
our
constitution.
there
is
obviously
confiscation
of
the
individual.
and
so
you
really
don't
get
to
the
question
of
confiscation
until
you
see
what
happens
to
the
individual
when
he
comes
up
and
claims
that
he
--
his
property
is
being
confiscated
but
for
the
purpose
of
my
discussion
here
to
point
out
that
there
is
this
great
question
against
confiscation,
i
like
to
look
on
this
situation
as
being
(inaudible)
that
the
just
considerate
producer
having
the
cost
experience
that
was
employed
in
the
yardsticks
â€“
the
yardstick
cost.
and
then
we
see
whether
or
not
his
property
would
be
confiscated
on
the
basis
of
the
yardstick
cost
that
were
employed.
and
in
that
context,
is
where
i
talk
about
the
confiscation
and
i
say
that
there
we
have
right
off
the
top
of
this,
over
a
cent
cushion
against
confiscation.
and
as
i
say,
we
supported
the
inclusion
of
this
but
we
supported
for
these
other
reasons.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes.
we're
talking
--
the
yardstick
cost
is
what
we
referred
to
as
the
average.
we
can
call
it
the
average.
you
can
call
it
an
adequate
sample.
you
can
call
it
whatever
you
want.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
no.
no,
there
isn't.
but
then
should
that
bother
us
really
at
all.
you
know
the
constitution
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
yes,
yes.
well,
no
it
doesn't
--
but
you
know,
the
constitution
does
provide
for
bankruptcy
legislation
as
i
understand
it.
and
so
even
in
those
early
days,
it
was
recognized
that
in
our
economic
system,
there
are
going
to
be
some
fatalities.
mr.
malcolm
h.
furbush
well
that
--
that's
right.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
would
like
it
your
honor.
now,
the
commission
as
has
been
pointed
out
several
times
today
employed
in
this
--
as
its
yardstick,
this
cost
of
gas
to
which
i
had
referenced
which
had
this
cushion
end
of
one
--
of
over
one
cent.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
recognized
as
being
the
highest
cost
gas
which
was
being
costed
by
the
participants
in
the
proceedings.
and
the
commission
referring
to
cost
of
casinghead
gas
said
that
it
could
not
be
accurately
determined.
and
one
of
the
criticisms
which
it
leveled
against
it
was
that
any
method
of
costing
casinghead
gas,
gas
that
comes
along
with
oil
which
allocates
to
that
gas
a
significant
or
substantial
amount
for
exploration,
one
was
found
as
a
byproduct
of
oil,
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
now,
that's
the
finding
of
the
commission
and
that
is
the
context
in
which
the
commission
was
criticizing
the
cost
studies
in
the
record
relative
to
casinghead
gas.
but
the
commission
also
said
in
recognizing
that
will
be
sold,
that
even
though
there
were
cost
studies
of
casinghead
gas
in
the
record
which
under
this
finding
would
still
be
overstated.
that
even
those
cost
studies
were
less
than
the
cost
yardstick
employed
by
the
commission.
now
this
being
so,
we
submit
that
during
--
when
you
hear
during
the
course
of
this
argument
references
to
cost
that
you
keep
in
mind
that
the
cost
which
was
referred
to
by
the
commission,
the
yardstick
costs
which
were
used
and
employed
in
the
development
of
the
commission
prices
were
costs
which
not
only
had
this
cushion
against
confiscation,
but
were
also
the
highest
cost
which
the
commission
felt
that
it
could
employ.
thank
you.
