mr.
c.
hayden
ames
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
c.
hayden
ames.
i
represent
san
diego
gas
&
electric
company.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
this
evening,
i
want
to
discuss
or
point
that
i
believe
would
--
will
be
concerning
all
of
you
individually
and
collectively
after
having
listened
all
of
this
time
to
the
description
of
the
massive
evidence
both
economic
and
cost
that
is
going
into
the
development
of
the
regulations
appear
under
review.
and
this
question
is
naturally
this,
is
this
going
to
work?
mr.
c.
hayden
ames
i'm
very
much
for
the
commission's
order.
the
question,
is
this
going
to
work?
is
the
area
rate
mechanism
going
to
produce
a
fair
result?
is
the
price
in
the
words
of
justice
jackson
in
the
hope
case
going
to
bring
--
to
be
an
effective
tool
in
bringing
the
gas
to
the
market?
we
as
distributors
are
greatly
concerned
over
this
as
mr.
ormasa
has
indicated.
we
are
--
have
large
amounts
of
plant
as
well
as
our
consumers
plants
invested
which
would
hardly
be
used
for
other
purposes.
for
this
reason,
we
find
that
the
producers'
argument
which
we've
heard
time
and
time
again,
somewhat
annoying
but
at
the
same
time
intriguing
in
this
argument.
you've
heard
it
today,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
have
their
unregulated
contract
prices.
and
unless
they
have
their
unregulated
contract
prices,
they
won't
bring
the
gas
to
the
market.
now,
this
is
annoying
because
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
as
it
ordered
the
federal
power
commissions
to
get
on
with
the
job
of
regulation,
in
the
catco
decision,
and
other
decision
so
that
there's
no
help
to
suggest
in
effect
to
non-regulation.
it
is
intriguing
to
me
in
this
respect
that
the
actual
effect
in
the
permian
basin
has
in
a
way
mocked
the
claim
of
the
producers.
i'm
sure,
they
may
be
unhappy
about
this.
but
practically,
in
a
lot
of
steps
with
the
proceedings
we're
considering
here
and
after
the
guideline
where
prices
were
adopted
in
1960
and
at
16
cents,
a
prodigious
and
very
prolific
effort
commenced
in
the
permian
basin,
in
the
deep
delaware
and
the
(inaudible)
portion
of
that
basin
where
these
producers
we're
going
down
to
depths
of
20,000
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
earth,
the
deepest
gas
wells
in
the
world.
this
commenced
in
about
1961
at
the
same
time
that
dr.
hills,
their
witness,
testified
before
the
commission
as
the
second
witness
that
this
would
be
the
area
where
the
gas
would
have
to
come
from
and
there
would
have
to
be
incentives
to
bring
the
gas
forth.
and
mr.
justice
fortas,
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
can
look
for
gas
as
distinguished
from
oil
was
that
as
--
that's
it's
a
physical
fact
that
the
further
you
go
in
depth,
the
less
you
get
an
oil,
the
more
you're
getting
gas.
anyway,
they've
been
going
to
these
great
depths
to
get
this
gas
and
this
is
since
--
let's
say
in
1960,
the
commission
adopted
the
guideline
prices
of
16
cents.
in
1964,
examiner
ware
(ph)
came
up
with
the
16
and
three-quarter
cents
for
new
gas
in
this
area.
and
finally,
in
1965,
the
commission
came
out
with
it
and
the
price
you
were
considering
here,
16
and
a
half
cents
is
the
ceiling
price.
all
of
this
period,
these
men
who
are
i'm
sure
very
hardheaded
not
in
the
sense
that
they
are
dumb
but
in
the
sense
that
they
are
economically
astute,
were
drilling
for
gas
in
the
permian
basin
and
it
became
one
of
the
large
producing
areas
in
recent
time.
now
this
is
documented
in
the
--
not
only
in
the
record
but
subsequent
to
the
record,
the
commission
who
has
the
same
concern
that
you
have,
is
this
going
to
work,
the
commission
had
before
it
a
number
of
cases
including
the
pipeline
case
that
mr.
ormasa
referred
to
which
was
all
in
opinion
500
where
they
said
--
they
preferred
a
large
pipeline
expansion
of
el
paso
and
transwestern
coming
partially
at
least
as
a
reserve
or
partially
out
of
the
permian
basin
over
this
competing
project
which
would
have
dedicated
6
trillion
feet
of
east
--
eastern,
southeastern
texas
gas
to
the
west
coast.
so
the
commission
knew
at
that
time
and
they
continues
to
have
cases,
opinion
519
to
new
pipeline
projects
into
the
permian
basis
--
basin
just
adopted
in
march
of
this
year
that
the
gas
is
forthcoming.
we
don't
say
that
this
is
the
end
of
the
line.
we
say
that
the
price
is
acting
as
a
tool
and
hopefully
we
believe
that
it
will
continue
and
that
the
commission
will
--
through
its
continuing
jurisdiction
develop
and
refine
this
method
so
that
they
can
keep
in
touch
with
what's
going
on
in
the
field
and
bring
the
gas
so
that
we
can
use
it
in
california.
thank
you.
