mr.
john
ormasa
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
john
ormasa.
i'm
general
counsel
for
the
pacific
lighting
system
of
companies
that
includes
southern
california
gas
company,
southern
counties
gas
company
of
california,
and
pacific
lighting
services
supply
company.
we
are
distributors,
serving
gas
to
some
10
million
people
in
southern
and
central
california.
our
interest
in
this
proceeding
is
different
from
that,
of
any
other
party
to
this
proceeding.
i'd
like
to
spell
that
out
a
bit
if
i
may.
mr.
john
ormasa
our
interest
justice
black
is
this,
that
we
are
a
straight
gas
company.
we
have
no
electric
service
that
we
provide
at
all,
that's
provided
by
other
utilities,
that
all
bears
on
this
question.
mr.
john
ormasa
we
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
ormasa
we
support
100%
affirmance
of
the
commission's
order.not
to
say
that
we
would
have
prepared
the
order
that
way,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
are
reasonably
satisfied
that
it
does
the
job.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
that,
“what
is
our
interest”.
we
are
not
interested
in
the
lowest
possible
conceivable
rate.
we
are
not
interested
in
a
rate
that
probably
will
bring
forth
the
gas
supplies.
what
we
are
interested
in
is
a
rate
that
will
produce
with
reasonable
certainty
those
gas
supplies
that
our
customers
must
have,
that's
number
one
here.
on
the
other
hand,
we
must
have
a
rate
that
is
not
too
high.
we
must
have
a
rate
that
permits
us
to
sell
our
product
in
competition
with
alternatives
that
are
available
to
our
customers.
let
me
say
this,
we
are
the
largest
single
purchaser
of
interstate
gas
going
out
to
the
permian
basin.
its
contract
--
in
our
companies
in
el
paso
is
not
a
gas
flowing
intrastate
out
of
the
permian
basin.
we're
talking
about
1945.
in
1946,
we
got
a
certificate
as
el
paso
did.
1947,
just
20
years
ago,
the
gas
started
to
flow
to
us
in
southern
california.
before
that
time,
we
produced
all
of
our
own
gas
in
california.
today,
our
companies
import
possibly
75%
to
80%
of
our
gas
supplies
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
in
1954,
this
court
said
in
phillips,
“you,
the
commission,
whether
you
want
to
or
not
must
regulate
the
fuel
price
of
the
producer”.
and
you
know
what
we
went
through?
we
went
through
unregulated
field
price
period.
1950's
the
gas-well
price
in
the
permian
basin
kept
jumping
and
jumping.
the
price
skyrocketed.
el
paso
is
buying.
the
northern
natural
came
in
to
the
basin.
the
transwestern
came
in
to
the
basin.
under
the
natural
gas
act,
when
the
cost
increase
of
the
pipeline
company,
it
files
for
rate
increase
and
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
--
cannot
prevent
an
increase
after
a
six-month
period
then
the
increase
goes
into
effect.
so
in
fact,
we
in
california
were
paying
very
high
prices
for
gas
flowing
out
of
the
permian
basin,
at
the
same
time
that
this
gas
prices
supposed
to
be
regulated
and
in
fact
was
not.
(inaudible),
our
largest
customer,
a
large
part,
out
to
seek
its
own
independent
gas
supply
because
it
didn't
want
to
have
what
in
fact
was
an
unregulated
price
that
can
jumping.
they
wanted
to
get
an
unregulated
price
at
a
fixed
rate
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
it's
only
because
of
the
activities
of
this
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
area
rate
proceeding
has
been
some
stability
went
to
the
industry.
mr.
john
ormasa
pardon?
yes,
it
did.
mr.
john
ormasa
it
entered
to
contracts
with
producers
in
the
field
and
that
a
new
company
is
to
be
set
up
by
one
of
the
existing
pipeline
companies
to
transport
the
gas
from
--
actually
it
was
in
south
texas
to
california.
now,
with
--
we
have
felt
sufficiently
encouraged
by
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
area
rate
area
that
this
is
what
we
have
agreed
to
do
with
our
two
largest
customers,
these
electric
utilities.
we
have
a
contract
with
them.
the
largest
one
is
for
175
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
year
and
the
contract
amount
for
the
department
of
oil
and
power
is
somewhat
smaller.
at
a
fixed
price,
guaranteed
price
by
our
companies,
29
and
three
quarter
cents
per
million
btu.
we've
gone
that
far
in
order
to
try
and
meet
their
desires
and
their
needs.
what's
going
to
happen
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
commission,
justice
harlan,
you
are
raising
question
about
that.
as
i
said,
we're
going
to
have
chaos.
you've
got
a
brand
new
commission.
you've
got
--
i'm
not
relating
those
two
obviously.
you
have
new
commissioners,
what
i'm
saying
is,
we
don't
know
what
they
feel
or
think,
what
their
views
maybe.
commissioner
swidler,
commissioner
black
are
gone,
commissioner
baggy
(ph)
who
was
on
the
commission
and
is
but
did
not
participate
in
the
permian
basin
proceeding.
commissioner
o'connor
went
along
--
mr.
john
ormasa
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice
harlan,
don't
misunderstand
me.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this.
is
that
these
gentlemen
are
not
committed
to
the
prior
opinion
rendered
by
the
commission.
and
what's
going
to
happen
when
it
goes
back
as
we
don't
know
it's
going
to
happen.
there
are
people
who
will
say
i'm
sure,
you
have
a
stale
record
and
they're
saying
that
already
in
this
case,
that
you
have
a
stale
record.
what
happens
if
we
go
back
on
remand?
everybody
will
say,
we'll
we've
got
a
stale
record.
we've
got
to
present
new
evidence.
we'll
be
back
here
before
this
court
in
the
70's
without
area
rate
concept.
you'd
finally
determine
in
the
permian
basin,
this
is
the
risk
that
we're
running.
these
are
the
things
we've
got
to
think
about.
mr.
john
ormasa
and
with
another
stale
record,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
ormasa
let
me
turn
to
one
last
point
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
use
of
the
area
rate
itself
as
the
inline
price
in
certificating
new
gas
sale.
as
we
see
it,
this
is
essential
and
proper.
why
do
we
have
inline
prices?
if
i
remember
what
the
catco
case
said,
it
says
as
to
hold
the
line
until
the
commission
has
had
a
chance
to
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
inline
price.
well
then
how
do
you
ignore
what
the
commission
has
just
found
to
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate?
you
say,
“no,
we'll
set
as
the
inline
price
with
some
other
rate”,
i'll
leave
that
problem
with
you.
thank
you
very
much
