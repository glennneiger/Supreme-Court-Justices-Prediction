mr.
lon
hocker
i
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
fundamental
question
in
this
case
was
touched
at
by
mr.
justice
fortas
a
moment
ago
when
he
pointed
out
that
this
case
had
been
tried
to
a
jury.
and
this
was
done,
not
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
but
at
the
request
of
the
plaintiff.
page
7
of
the
transcript
you
will
see
that
in
the
bottom
of
the
complaint
that
plaintiff
said
--
the
plaintiff
request
a
trial
by
jury
of
all
the
issues
herein
pleaded.
now
we
had
a
trial
by
jury
of
all
the
issues
here
and
pleaded
and
they
lost.
and
they
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
he
did
alleged
error
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
submission
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
this
proceeding,
in
this
certiorari,
no
error,
not
any
error
is
alleged
as
a
ground
of
reversal
and
no
relief
is
prayed
for
except
outright
reversals,
not
remand
for
a
new
trial
because
of
an
error
in
the
charge
of
the
court.
the
question
presented
appears
at
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
question
presented
is
only
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
newspaper's
actions
of
soliciting
away
the
customers
are
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
similarly,
the
prayer
of
the
petition
which
appears
at
page
32
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
simply,
petitioner
respectfully
prays
the
court
to
reverse
for
decis
--
reverse
the
decision
below
and
direct
the
judgment
be
entered
for
the
petitioner
albrecht
on
the
manner
of
liability
and
the
trial
be
had
on
the
amount
of
damages
resulting
from
the
unlawful
solicitations
and
unlawful
termination.
but
the
only
question
before
this
court
is,
shall
the
case
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
that
this
defendant
has
violated
a
criminal
statute
which
raises
before
the
court
a
most
vital
constitutional
question
which
is
thoroughly
briefed
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
this
court
has
no
constitutional
jurisdiction
to
make
such
an
order
as
plaintiff
seeks
here
because
the
predicate
of
liability
here
is
a
violation
of
a
criminal
statute,
a
misdemeanor
enacted
by
the
congress.
and
the
relief
sought
is
the
punishment
of
the
defendant,
treble-damages
has
to
be
a
punishment
because
the
cons
--
the
bill
of
rights
says
that
no
fact
found
by
a
jury
can
be
otherwise
reexamined.
mr.
lon
hocker
of
guilty?
yes
indeed
sir.
mr.
lon
hocker
well,
the
label
which
is
put
upon
it,
this
court
has
held
many
times
mr.
justice
fortas,
does
not
control
the
constitutional
effect.
and
that
the
constitutional
effect
is
to
punish
the
defendant
your
honor.
i
know
this
is
a
noble
argument,
for
70
years,
the
statute's
been
on
the
books.
but
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
it
just
never
been
tried
out
in
this
court.
and
there
are
10
reasons,
10
constitutional
provisions
which
are
violated
in
my
view
by
any
such
direction
as
this.
mr.
lon
hocker
why
of
course,
yes
your
honor.
but
we
have
had
a
trial
here
and
no
error
is
raised
in
this
court
as
to
an
error
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
question
really
presented
here
is
whether
on
the
record
in
this
case,
the
court
shall
adjudge
the
respondent
guilty
of
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime
which
is
the
predicate
of
recovery
here.
it
has
to
find
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
but
for
any
liability
can
arise
your
honors
have
held
that
treble-damages
aren't
punishment,
punishment
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights
except
imposition
by
reason
of
the
requirements
of
the
bill
of
rights.
now
i
have
briefed
this,
there
are
40
cases
cited
in
the
petition
--
on
the
petition
--
on
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
28
cases
from
this
court.
the
constitution
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment
of
this
section
is
also
set
forth
in
the
brief.
time
of
course
did
not
permit
me
to
go
into
that
at
any
length
but
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
do
contend
that
to
instruct
a
verdict
which
would
have
the
result
of
imposing
punishment
upon
the
defendant
for
the
violation
of
a
misdemeanor
statute
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights.
may
i
turn
if
you
please
to
the
--
what
i
might
call
the
antitrust
case
that
is
before
you.
mr.
dorsey
is
somewhat
at
error
in
the
origin
of
this
litigation.
it
is
not
true
that
the
globe-democrat
told
the
plaintiff
here
and
others
in
his
position
that
they
would
deal
with
him
no
longer.
there
was
a
contract
between
the
--
a
so-called
union
of
carriers
of
these
newspapers
and
the
defendant
and
it
was
the
union
itself
including
albrecht
that
notified
the
globe-democrat
that
it
would
no
longer
abide
by
this
contract
and
didn't
consider
itself
to
be
bound
that
the
parties
weren't
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
contract.
now
the
contract
while
informed,
a
labor
contract
was
actually
merely
a
matter
of
convenience
and
it
reserved
the
right
to
the
newspaper
to
set
the
retail
price
of
the
newspaper
unilaterally.
and
at
page
56
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
when
the
union
teminated
the
contract
relationship,
the
newspaper
said
very
well,
“these
are
the
circumstances
under
which
we
will
permit
you
to
sell
our
newspapers
in
your
territories.”
and
they're
all
set
out
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
followed
in
this
case,
they
appear
on
pages
56
and
57
of
the
record.
and
they
say
that
we
will
permit
you
although
we
can't
set
your
territories
and
although
we
reserve
the
right
to
terminate
the
territorial
sale
of
newspapers
by
you
in
this
area,
we
recognized
that
people
do
sometimes
buy
and
sell
these
routes
between
themselves
and
we
will
not
object
to
someone
else
to
whom
you
wish
to
sell
it,
appointing
him
as
a
news
dealer
in
this
area
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
is
paying
something
for
it
although
we
do
not
recognize
any
property
rights
with
respect
to
it.
and
we
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
prosecution
of
the
newspaper
enterprise
that
a
minimum
price
be
maintained
--
a
maximum
price
i
should
say
be
maintained.
and
if
you
violate
this
maximum
price,
we
will
compete
with
you.
this
is
what
we
said.
now
albrecht
paid
$11,000
for
this
route.
he
was
a
man
of
little
education,
no
business
background,
he
had
been
a
route
salesman
for
a
bread
company
and
some
others
and
had
done
a
little
farming,
and
he
had
to
mortgage
his
house
to
raise
the
$11,000
and
make
some
notes
to
the
fellow
that
he
--
from
whom
he
bought
this
route,
and
this
was
his
all,
this
route.
now
your
honor
said
in
parke,
davis
that
mr.
dorsey
is
fond
of
reporting
that
we
cannot
go
further
than
a
mere
declination
to
sell.
now
it's
a
position
with
the
respondent
here
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
didn't
go
as
far
as
the
mere
refusal
to
sell.
it
--
does
--
i
think
the
wording
of
mr.
j
--
mr.
brennan's
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
as
a
simple
refusal
of
sale.
a
simple
refusal
to
sell
in
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
very
simple.
for
albrecht,
it
would
have
been
a
complete
wipeout
of
his
entire
investment.
the
mortgage
on
his
house
would
have
come
due.
and
what
the
globe-democrat
said,
instead
of
saying,
“sorry,
we're
not
going
to
sell
you
anymore,”
is
“we'll
continue
to
sell
you
and
we'll
sell
alongside
of
you
as
long
as
you
insist
upon
setting
your
own
price.
and
therefore,
we
will
make
available
to
the
people
in
your
territory,
the
newspaper
at
the
price
which
we
think
it
ought
to
be
sold
at.
and
we
continued
that
way
for
several
months,
he's
selling
at
his
price
and
i
suppose
later
as
the
record
tells
he
reduced
his
price,
at
least
he
so
testified
but
it
was
not
until
this
suit
was
filed.
this
suit
was
filed
that
he
was
told,
“sorry,
we
can't
continue
to
act
as
you
have
our
dis
--
to
be
our
distributor
and
at
the
same
time
litigate
with
us.
so
you
must
choose.”
but
even
then,
we
didn't
give
him
a
simple
refusal
to
sell.
even
then
we
said
you've
got
60
days
to
find
somebody
else
and
we'll
let
you
sell
it
to
somebody
else
and
he
did
find
somebody
else.
mr.
lon
hocker
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lon
hocker
because
we
said
so.
mr.
lon
hocker
no
sir,
this
is
--
there
no
legal
reason
why.
we
could
have
litigated
with
him
of
course
while
selling
him
newspapers
but
we
have
the
right
unilaterally
to
terminate
and
to
do
business
with
which
we
can
if
there's
any
breadth
at
all
left
in
colgate
as
the
chief
justice
--
justice
white
suggests
and
we
did
say,
we
exercised
our
right
not
to
deal
with
you
if
you're
going
to
litigate
with
us.
but
even
so,
we
gave
him
60
days
to
find
someone
to
buy.
mr.
lon
hocker
it
would've
been
sufficient
to
us
justice
white
but
we
never
knew
about
it
until
the
trial.
he
never
told
us
that.
as
mr.
dorsey
says
at
the
time
that
we
cut
him
off
and
the
time
we
discussed
the
sale
with
somebody
else,
he
didn't
--
we
didn't
know
that
he
was
--
reduced
his
price,
if
he'd
reduced
his
price,
well,
we
were
quite
happy.
mr.
lon
hocker
oh
yes,
it
was
never
--
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
anywhere
in
this
case
of
the
requirement
of
an
agreement
by
anybody.
and
it's
specially
as
should
in
the
respondent's
brief,
he
says,
“other
than
the
case
of
albrecht,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
coercion
of
anybody.”
this
is
a
respondent's
--
of
the
--
the
petitioner
himself
says
there.
no
sir,
we
have
never
agreed
with
anybody
with
respect
to
price
and
we've
had
simply
this
unilateral
declaration
of
policy
if
you
sell
at
the
price
of
--
we're
going
to
compete
with.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
hocker
answer
to
the
first
question,
yes
it
would
be
because
it
would
involve
an
agreement
and
in
the
second
place,
it
is
not
like
this
case
for
reasons
which
--
i'll
interrupt
myself
to
state
if
your
honor
will
permit
me.
in
the
current
edition
of
the
antitrust
law
journal,
there
is
a
debate
on
how
to
argue
an
antitrust
case
in
the
supreme
court
and
as
your
honors
may
not
be
aware
of,
a
mr.
gesell
says
the
following.
mr.
lon
hocker
mr.
gesell,
a
member
of
this
court,
gerhard
gesell.
mr.
lon
hocker
i
--
mr.
lon
hocker
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
lon
hocker
that
he
--
he
says,
i
think
the
second
point
that
i
would
make
about
antitrust
cases
is
that
the
court
is
more
interested
in
the
economic
significance
of
what
you're
talking
about
than
about
the
law.
i
don't
think
they're
very
interested
in
the
law
because
they
are
writing
that
as
they
go
along.
i'm
serious
about
that
as
you
probably
know
the
court
three
or
four
times
has
said
that
their
objective
is
to
carry
out
a
statute
designed
to
create
a
nation
of
small
shopkeepers.
there
in
lies
a
distinction
--
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
the
answer
--
i
would
like
to
expand
on
it
if
i
may
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
shelf
life
of
a
new
chevrolet
is
a
year.
the
shelf
life
of
a
newspaper
is
about
four
hours.
a
newspaper
after
four
hours
has
gone
by,
is
only
good
to
start
a
fire
with
or
line
a
garbage
pale,
it
isn't
any
good
as
a
commodity.
therefore,
it
has
to
be
distributed
to
home
delivery
promptly
and
right
now.
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
done.
therefore,
i
think
there's
an
immense
difference
between
the
system,
the
distribution
between
automobiles
and
newspapers
which
can't
be
reconciled
by
what
i
might
call
a
doctrine
error
or
approach
to
the
statute.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
if
i
may
develop
that
a
little
bit
further,
there's
undoubtedly
the
right
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
newspaper
to
sell
directly
to
the
reader.
we
can
with
our
own
employees
deliver
the
newspaper
to
the
reader's
door
instead
of
through
independent
merchant
as
we
do
now
and
as
we
did
in
this
case.
and
of
course
since
three-fourths
of
the
newspaper's
revenue
comes
from
the
advertising
rather
than
from
the
circulation
revenue,
the
newspaper
is
going
to
see
that
the
price
is
kept
down.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
news
dealer,
he
is
better
off
to
sell
a
hundred
newspapers
at
a
dollar
and
500
newspapers
at
10
cents
because
it's
a
lot
less
expensive
to
make
such
delivery.
he
said,
he
would
do
so
of
course
if
he
could.
this
would
be
death
to
the
newspaper,
couldn't
stand
that
because
its
(inaudible)
line
rate
would
go
to
(inaudible)
and
it
wouldn't
sell
any
advertising.
so,
if
it
is
impossible
for
a
newspaper
to
require
its
news
dealers
to
maintain
a
certain
minimum
price,
the
only
alternative
for
the
newspapers
is
to
wash
out
all
such
people
and
to
wash
out
their
investments,
their
$11,000
or
$20,000
whatever
they
may
be,
and
deliver
the
newspapers
themselves.
this
is
the
economic
consequence
of
this.
but
i
think
more
than
that,
if
your
honor
please
the
fact
that
there
must
be
an
immediate
delivery
that
the
economic
necessity
of
the
sale
of
the
newspaper
requires
the
delivery,
requires
a
different
approach
to
the
territorial
franchise
as
in
the
case
of
an
automobile.
there's
no
difficulty.
if
i'm
going
to
pay
$2-3000
for
an
automobile,
i
don't
mind
to
be
driving
a
hundred
or
200
miles
to
get
a
better
price.
and
an
automobile
in
itself
of
course
is
a
mobile
device.so
perhaps
this
makes
a
distinction
between
the
chevrolet
case
or
not.
but
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
mr.
dorsey
a
while
ago
and
that
is,
who
is
the
combination
with?
now
i've
never
had
a
satisfactory
answer
to
this
either
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
briefing
in
this
court
and
i
should
point
out
to
your
hnors
that
this
case
was
tried,
it
was
pre-tried
and
tried
on
an
allegation
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
culmination
between
the
globe-democrat
and
persons
or
persons
unknown.
now
at
the
time
the
charge
was
being
made
up,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in,
the
plaintiff
saw
that
it
was
very
awkward
to
suppose
to
the
jury
a
combination
with
parties
unknown.
so
he
amended
his
complaint
at
the
time
of
the
charge
to
say
that
you
combined
with
plaintiff's
customers
and/or
merely
circulation
sales
which
was
a
circulation
company
and/or
george
kroner.
mr.
lon
hocker
george
kroner
was
a
man
who
delivered
the
300
newspapers
which
were
obtained
by
the
globe-democrat
by
competition
with
albrecht.
the
testimony
and
kroner
was
at
--
a
witness
called
by
the
petitioner
not
by
the
respondent,
the
testimony
was
that
kroner
never
solicited
a
customer
of
albrecht's
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
acquiring
customers
from
albrecht
at
all.
he
merely
delivered
the
newspapers
which
had
been
obtained
by
the
globe-democrat's
competition.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
he
bought
and
resold
the
newspapers.
mr.
lon
hocker
and
set
his
own
prices
although
as
he
said,
i
recognized
the
globe-democrat's
suggested
retail
price
and
abided
by
it.
yes
sir
this
is
true.
but
in
any
case,
there
could
be
no
clause
or
connection
between
the
two
things
which
are
the
subject
of
the
complaint
here
and
anything
that
kroner
did.
because
the
petition
ends
with
a
prayer
that
the
only
damages
he
wants
here
are
those
resulting
from
the
unlawful
solicitations
and
the
unlawful
terminations
and
kroner's
activity
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
either
with
the
solicitations
or
with
the
termination.
now,
i
have
said
your
honors
that
in
the
second
point
in
the
brief,
that
this
and/or
allegation
constitutes
an
allegation
of
seven
different
combinations
with
each
one
of
the
three
or
with
any
two
of
the
three
or
with
all
of
the
three,
this
is
the
allegation.
he
says
and/or,
and/or.
and
yet
what
he
is
complaining
of
here
is
the
failure
of
the
court
to
direct
a
verdict
on
a
question
of
liability.
and
i
say
unless
he
could
specify
to
the
court
on
which
of
these
claims,
which
of
these
alleged
conspiracies
existed
as
a
matter
of
law.
he's
in
no
position
to
ask
the
court
to
make
an
instruction
of
this
sort,
where
there
are
alternative
pleadings
and
of
course
you
can
have
alternative
pleadings
and
alternative
submissions
because
the
rule
of
law
is,
that
a
jury
may
select
between
alternatives
which
are
well-pleaded.
but
this
does
not
mean
and
the
reason
for
that
of
course
is
because
where
alternatives
exist
and
are
supported
in
the
record
reasonable
minds
can
differ
but
the
predicate
of
a
directive
verdict
is
that
reasonable
minds
cannot
differ
and
therefore,
where
he
submits
a
pleading
and
this
was
done
not
back
in
the
pretrial
days,
but
after
trial,
at
the
time
the
charge
was
being
made
up,
history
was
that
there
were
seven
alternative
combinations.
actually
i
think
we've
demonstrated
in
our
brief
that
there
was
no
combination
with
anybody.
and
this
i
think
is
the
true
position
which
the
petitioner
takes
both
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
because
the
question
presened
does
not
predicate
an
agreement
with
anybody.
the
question
presented
on
page
2
of
their
brief
and
also
in
the
petition
itself
says
nothing
about
a
combination
with
anyone.
it
says,
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
newspaper's
actions
of
soliciting
away
the
customers
of
one
of
his
independent
merchant
carriers
in
order
to
induce
him
to
comply
with
its
suggested
resale
price
and
then
terminating
sales
to
him
for
his
continued
refusal
to
agree
to
comply
are
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
so
that
he
would
have
you
say
that
merely
the
combination
between
the
coercer
and
the
coercee
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
yet
the
statute
itself,
the
wording
of
the
statute
requires
that
there'd
be
a
contract,
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
none
such
was
pleaded.none
such
is
showed
here.
the
rule
of
law
which
the
petitioner
strives
for
would
not
require
any
such
--
the
existence
of
anything
of
this
sort.
so
we
feel
your
honors
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here
to
afford
the
relief
which
the
plaintiff
wants.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
not
available
to
him
under
the
theory
of
the
case
in
which
it
was
tried
below.
and
that
lastly,
the
statement
of
law
upon
which
he
predicates
his
claim
for
relief
is
not
in
accordance
either
with
the
statute
or
with
the
decided
cases.
thank
you
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
lon
hocker
i
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
fundamental
question
in
this
case
was
touched
at
by
mr.
justice
fortas
a
moment
ago
when
he
pointed
out
that
this
case
had
been
tried
to
a
jury.
and
this
was
done,
not
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
but
at
the
request
of
the
plaintiff.
page
7
of
the
transcript
you
will
see
that
in
the
bottom
of
the
complaint
that
plaintiff
said
--
the
plaintiff
request
a
trial
by
jury
of
all
the
issues
herein
pleaded.
now
we
had
a
trial
by
jury
of
all
the
issues
here
and
pleaded
and
they
lost.
and
they
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
he
did
alleged
error
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
submission
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
this
proceeding,
in
this
certiorari,
no
error,
not
any
error
is
alleged
as
a
ground
of
reversal
and
no
relief
is
prayed
for
except
outright
reversals,
not
remand
for
a
new
trial
because
of
an
error
in
the
charge
of
the
court.
the
question
presented
appears
at
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
question
presented
is
only
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
newspaper's
actions
of
soliciting
away
the
customers
are
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
similarly,
the
prayer
of
the
petition
which
appears
at
page
32
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
simply,
petitioner
respectfully
prays
the
court
to
reverse
for
decis
--
reverse
the
decision
below
and
direct
the
judgment
be
entered
for
the
petitioner
albrecht
on
the
manner
of
liability
and
the
trial
be
had
on
the
amount
of
damages
resulting
from
the
unlawful
solicitations
and
unlawful
termination.
but
the
only
question
before
this
court
is,
shall
the
case
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
that
this
defendant
has
violated
a
criminal
statute
which
raises
before
the
court
a
most
vital
constitutional
question
which
is
thoroughly
briefed
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
this
court
has
no
constitutional
jurisdiction
to
make
such
an
order
as
plaintiff
seeks
here
because
the
predicate
of
liability
here
is
a
violation
of
a
criminal
statute,
a
misdemeanor
enacted
by
the
congress.
and
the
relief
sought
is
the
punishment
of
the
defendant,
treble-damages
has
to
be
a
punishment
because
the
cons
--
the
bill
of
rights
says
that
no
fact
found
by
a
jury
can
be
otherwise
reexamined.
mr.
lon
hocker
of
guilty?
yes
indeed
sir.
mr.
lon
hocker
well,
the
label
which
is
put
upon
it,
this
court
has
held
many
times
mr.
justice
fortas,
does
not
control
the
constitutional
effect.
and
that
the
constitutional
effect
is
to
punish
the
defendant
your
honor.
i
know
this
is
a
noble
argument,
for
70
years,
the
statute's
been
on
the
books.
but
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
it
just
never
been
tried
out
in
this
court.
and
there
are
10
reasons,
10
constitutional
provisions
which
are
violated
in
my
view
by
any
such
direction
as
this.
mr.
lon
hocker
why
of
course,
yes
your
honor.
but
we
have
had
a
trial
here
and
no
error
is
raised
in
this
court
as
to
an
error
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
question
really
presented
here
is
whether
on
the
record
in
this
case,
the
court
shall
adjudge
the
respondent
guilty
of
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime
which
is
the
predicate
of
recovery
here.
it
has
to
find
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
but
for
any
liability
can
arise
your
honors
have
held
that
treble-damages
aren't
punishment,
punishment
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights
except
imposition
by
reason
of
the
requirements
of
the
bill
of
rights.
now
i
have
briefed
this,
there
are
40
cases
cited
in
the
petition
--
on
the
petition
--
on
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
28
cases
from
this
court.
the
constitution
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment
of
this
section
is
also
set
forth
in
the
brief.
time
of
course
did
not
permit
me
to
go
into
that
at
any
length
but
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
do
contend
that
to
instruct
a
verdict
which
would
have
the
result
of
imposing
punishment
upon
the
defendant
for
the
violation
of
a
misdemeanor
statute
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights.
may
i
turn
if
you
please
to
the
--
what
i
might
call
the
antitrust
case
that
is
before
you.
mr.
dorsey
is
somewhat
at
error
in
the
origin
of
this
litigation.
it
is
not
true
that
the
globe-democrat
told
the
plaintiff
here
and
others
in
his
position
that
they
would
deal
with
him
no
longer.
there
was
a
contract
between
the
--
a
so-called
union
of
carriers
of
these
newspapers
and
the
defendant
and
it
was
the
union
itself
including
albrecht
that
notified
the
globe-democrat
that
it
would
no
longer
abide
by
this
contract
and
didn't
consider
itself
to
be
bound
that
the
parties
weren't
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
contract.
now
the
contract
while
informed,
a
labor
contract
was
actually
merely
a
matter
of
convenience
and
it
reserved
the
right
to
the
newspaper
to
set
the
retail
price
of
the
newspaper
unilaterally.
and
at
page
56
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
when
the
union
teminated
the
contract
relationship,
the
newspaper
said
very
well,
“these
are
the
circumstances
under
which
we
will
permit
you
to
sell
our
newspapers
in
your
territories.”
and
they're
all
set
out
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
followed
in
this
case,
they
appear
on
pages
56
and
57
of
the
record.
and
they
say
that
we
will
permit
you
although
we
can't
set
your
territories
and
although
we
reserve
the
right
to
terminate
the
territorial
sale
of
newspapers
by
you
in
this
area,
we
recognized
that
people
do
sometimes
buy
and
sell
these
routes
between
themselves
and
we
will
not
object
to
someone
else
to
whom
you
wish
to
sell
it,
appointing
him
as
a
news
dealer
in
this
area
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
is
paying
something
for
it
although
we
do
not
recognize
any
property
rights
with
respect
to
it.
and
we
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
prosecution
of
the
newspaper
enterprise
that
a
minimum
price
be
maintained
--
a
maximum
price
i
should
say
be
maintained.
and
if
you
violate
this
maximum
price,
we
will
compete
with
you.
this
is
what
we
said.
now
albrecht
paid
$11,000
for
this
route.
he
was
a
man
of
little
education,
no
business
background,
he
had
been
a
route
salesman
for
a
bread
company
and
some
others
and
had
done
a
little
farming,
and
he
had
to
mortgage
his
house
to
raise
the
$11,000
and
make
some
notes
to
the
fellow
that
he
--
from
whom
he
bought
this
route,
and
this
was
his
all,
this
route.
now
your
honor
said
in
parke,
davis
that
mr.
dorsey
is
fond
of
reporting
that
we
cannot
go
further
than
a
mere
declination
to
sell.
now
it's
a
position
with
the
respondent
here
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
didn't
go
as
far
as
the
mere
refusal
to
sell.
it
--
does
--
i
think
the
wording
of
mr.
j
--
mr.
brennan's
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
as
a
simple
refusal
of
sale.
a
simple
refusal
to
sell
in
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
very
simple.
for
albrecht,
it
would
have
been
a
complete
wipeout
of
his
entire
investment.
the
mortgage
on
his
house
would
have
come
due.
and
what
the
globe-democrat
said,
instead
of
saying,
“sorry,
we're
not
going
to
sell
you
anymore,”
is
“we'll
continue
to
sell
you
and
we'll
sell
alongside
of
you
as
long
as
you
insist
upon
setting
your
own
price.
and
therefore,
we
will
make
available
to
the
people
in
your
territory,
the
newspaper
at
the
price
which
we
think
it
ought
to
be
sold
at.
and
we
continued
that
way
for
several
months,
he's
selling
at
his
price
and
i
suppose
later
as
the
record
tells
he
reduced
his
price,
at
least
he
so
testified
but
it
was
not
until
this
suit
was
filed.
this
suit
was
filed
that
he
was
told,
“sorry,
we
can't
continue
to
act
as
you
have
our
dis
--
to
be
our
distributor
and
at
the
same
time
litigate
with
us.
so
you
must
choose.”
but
even
then,
we
didn't
give
him
a
simple
refusal
to
sell.
even
then
we
said
you've
got
60
days
to
find
somebody
else
and
we'll
let
you
sell
it
to
somebody
else
and
he
did
find
somebody
else.
mr.
lon
hocker
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lon
hocker
because
we
said
so.
mr.
lon
hocker
no
sir,
this
is
--
there
no
legal
reason
why.
we
could
have
litigated
with
him
of
course
while
selling
him
newspapers
but
we
have
the
right
unilaterally
to
terminate
and
to
do
business
with
which
we
can
if
there's
any
breadth
at
all
left
in
colgate
as
the
chief
justice
--
justice
white
suggests
and
we
did
say,
we
exercised
our
right
not
to
deal
with
you
if
you're
going
to
litigate
with
us.
but
even
so,
we
gave
him
60
days
to
find
someone
to
buy.
mr.
lon
hocker
it
would've
been
sufficient
to
us
justice
white
but
we
never
knew
about
it
until
the
trial.
he
never
told
us
that.
as
mr.
dorsey
says
at
the
time
that
we
cut
him
off
and
the
time
we
discussed
the
sale
with
somebody
else,
he
didn't
--
we
didn't
know
that
he
was
--
reduced
his
price,
if
he'd
reduced
his
price,
well,
we
were
quite
happy.
mr.
lon
hocker
oh
yes,
it
was
never
--
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
anywhere
in
this
case
of
the
requirement
of
an
agreement
by
anybody.
and
it's
specially
as
should
in
the
respondent's
brief,
he
says,
“other
than
the
case
of
albrecht,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
coercion
of
anybody.”
this
is
a
respondent's
--
of
the
--
the
petitioner
himself
says
there.
no
sir,
we
have
never
agreed
with
anybody
with
respect
to
price
and
we've
had
simply
this
unilateral
declaration
of
policy
if
you
sell
at
the
price
of
--
we're
going
to
compete
with.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
hocker
answer
to
the
first
question,
yes
it
would
be
because
it
would
involve
an
agreement
and
in
the
second
place,
it
is
not
like
this
case
for
reasons
which
--
i'll
interrupt
myself
to
state
if
your
honor
will
permit
me.
in
the
current
edition
of
the
antitrust
law
journal,
there
is
a
debate
on
how
to
argue
an
antitrust
case
in
the
supreme
court
and
as
your
honors
may
not
be
aware
of,
a
mr.
gesell
says
the
following.
mr.
lon
hocker
mr.
gesell,
a
member
of
this
court,
gerhard
gesell.
mr.
lon
hocker
i
--
mr.
lon
hocker
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
lon
hocker
that
he
--
he
says,
i
think
the
second
point
that
i
would
make
about
antitrust
cases
is
that
the
court
is
more
interested
in
the
economic
significance
of
what
you're
talking
about
than
about
the
law.
i
don't
think
they're
very
interested
in
the
law
because
they
are
writing
that
as
they
go
along.
i'm
serious
about
that
as
you
probably
know
the
court
three
or
four
times
has
said
that
their
objective
is
to
carry
out
a
statute
designed
to
create
a
nation
of
small
shopkeepers.
there
in
lies
a
distinction
--
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
the
answer
--
i
would
like
to
expand
on
it
if
i
may
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
shelf
life
of
a
new
chevrolet
is
a
year.
the
shelf
life
of
a
newspaper
is
about
four
hours.
a
newspaper
after
four
hours
has
gone
by,
is
only
good
to
start
a
fire
with
or
line
a
garbage
pale,
it
isn't
any
good
as
a
commodity.
therefore,
it
has
to
be
distributed
to
home
delivery
promptly
and
right
now.
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
done.
therefore,
i
think
there's
an
immense
difference
between
the
system,
the
distribution
between
automobiles
and
newspapers
which
can't
be
reconciled
by
what
i
might
call
a
doctrine
error
or
approach
to
the
statute.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
if
i
may
develop
that
a
little
bit
further,
there's
undoubtedly
the
right
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
newspaper
to
sell
directly
to
the
reader.
we
can
with
our
own
employees
deliver
the
newspaper
to
the
reader's
door
instead
of
through
independent
merchant
as
we
do
now
and
as
we
did
in
this
case.
and
of
course
since
three-fourths
of
the
newspaper's
revenue
comes
from
the
advertising
rather
than
from
the
circulation
revenue,
the
newspaper
is
going
to
see
that
the
price
is
kept
down.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
news
dealer,
he
is
better
off
to
sell
a
hundred
newspapers
at
a
dollar
and
500
newspapers
at
10
cents
because
it's
a
lot
less
expensive
to
make
such
delivery.
he
said,
he
would
do
so
of
course
if
he
could.
this
would
be
death
to
the
newspaper,
couldn't
stand
that
because
its
(inaudible)
line
rate
would
go
to
(inaudible)
and
it
wouldn't
sell
any
advertising.
so,
if
it
is
impossible
for
a
newspaper
to
require
its
news
dealers
to
maintain
a
certain
minimum
price,
the
only
alternative
for
the
newspapers
is
to
wash
out
all
such
people
and
to
wash
out
their
investments,
their
$11,000
or
$20,000
whatever
they
may
be,
and
deliver
the
newspapers
themselves.
this
is
the
economic
consequence
of
this.
but
i
think
more
than
that,
if
your
honor
please
the
fact
that
there
must
be
an
immediate
delivery
that
the
economic
necessity
of
the
sale
of
the
newspaper
requires
the
delivery,
requires
a
different
approach
to
the
territorial
franchise
as
in
the
case
of
an
automobile.
there's
no
difficulty.
if
i'm
going
to
pay
$2-3000
for
an
automobile,
i
don't
mind
to
be
driving
a
hundred
or
200
miles
to
get
a
better
price.
and
an
automobile
in
itself
of
course
is
a
mobile
device.so
perhaps
this
makes
a
distinction
between
the
chevrolet
case
or
not.
but
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
mr.
dorsey
a
while
ago
and
that
is,
who
is
the
combination
with?
now
i've
never
had
a
satisfactory
answer
to
this
either
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
briefing
in
this
court
and
i
should
point
out
to
your
hnors
that
this
case
was
tried,
it
was
pre-tried
and
tried
on
an
allegation
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
culmination
between
the
globe-democrat
and
persons
or
persons
unknown.
now
at
the
time
the
charge
was
being
made
up,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in,
the
plaintiff
saw
that
it
was
very
awkward
to
suppose
to
the
jury
a
combination
with
parties
unknown.
so
he
amended
his
complaint
at
the
time
of
the
charge
to
say
that
you
combined
with
plaintiff's
customers
and/or
merely
circulation
sales
which
was
a
circulation
company
and/or
george
kroner.
mr.
lon
hocker
george
kroner
was
a
man
who
delivered
the
300
newspapers
which
were
obtained
by
the
globe-democrat
by
competition
with
albrecht.
the
testimony
and
kroner
was
at
--
a
witness
called
by
the
petitioner
not
by
the
respondent,
the
testimony
was
that
kroner
never
solicited
a
customer
of
albrecht's
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
acquiring
customers
from
albrecht
at
all.
he
merely
delivered
the
newspapers
which
had
been
obtained
by
the
globe-democrat's
competition.
mr.
lon
hocker
yes
sir.
he
bought
and
resold
the
newspapers.
mr.
lon
hocker
and
set
his
own
prices
although
as
he
said,
i
recognized
the
globe-democrat's
suggested
retail
price
and
abided
by
it.
yes
sir
this
is
true.
but
in
any
case,
there
could
be
no
clause
or
connection
between
the
two
things
which
are
the
subject
of
the
complaint
here
and
anything
that
kroner
did.
because
the
petition
ends
with
a
prayer
that
the
only
damages
he
wants
here
are
those
resulting
from
the
unlawful
solicitations
and
the
unlawful
terminations
and
kroner's
activity
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
either
with
the
solicitations
or
with
the
termination.
now,
i
have
said
your
honors
that
in
the
second
point
in
the
brief,
that
this
and/or
allegation
constitutes
an
allegation
of
seven
different
combinations
with
each
one
of
the
three
or
with
any
two
of
the
three
or
with
all
of
the
three,
this
is
the
allegation.
he
says
and/or,
and/or.
and
yet
what
he
is
complaining
of
here
is
the
failure
of
the
court
to
direct
a
verdict
on
a
question
of
liability.
and
i
say
unless
he
could
specify
to
the
court
on
which
of
these
claims,
which
of
these
alleged
conspiracies
existed
as
a
matter
of
law.
he's
in
no
position
to
ask
the
court
to
make
an
instruction
of
this
sort,
where
there
are
alternative
pleadings
and
of
course
you
can
have
alternative
pleadings
and
alternative
submissions
because
the
rule
of
law
is,
that
a
jury
may
select
between
alternatives
which
are
well-pleaded.
but
this
does
not
mean
and
the
reason
for
that
of
course
is
because
where
alternatives
exist
and
are
supported
in
the
record
reasonable
minds
can
differ
but
the
predicate
of
a
directive
verdict
is
that
reasonable
minds
cannot
differ
and
therefore,
where
he
submits
a
pleading
and
this
was
done
not
back
in
the
pretrial
days,
but
after
trial,
at
the
time
the
charge
was
being
made
up,
history
was
that
there
were
seven
alternative
combinations.
actually
i
think
we've
demonstrated
in
our
brief
that
there
was
no
combination
with
anybody.
and
this
i
think
is
the
true
position
which
the
petitioner
takes
both
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
because
the
question
presened
does
not
predicate
an
agreement
with
anybody.
the
question
presented
on
page
2
of
their
brief
and
also
in
the
petition
itself
says
nothing
about
a
combination
with
anyone.
it
says,
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
newspaper's
actions
of
soliciting
away
the
customers
of
one
of
his
independent
merchant
carriers
in
order
to
induce
him
to
comply
with
its
suggested
resale
price
and
then
terminating
sales
to
him
for
his
continued
refusal
to
agree
to
comply
are
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
so
that
he
would
have
you
say
that
merely
the
combination
between
the
coercer
and
the
coercee
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
yet
the
statute
itself,
the
wording
of
the
statute
requires
that
there'd
be
a
contract,
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
none
such
was
pleaded.none
such
is
showed
here.
the
rule
of
law
which
the
petitioner
strives
for
would
not
require
any
such
--
the
existence
of
anything
of
this
sort.
so
we
feel
your
honors
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here
to
afford
the
relief
which
the
plaintiff
wants.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
not
available
to
him
under
the
theory
of
the
case
in
which
it
was
tried
below.
and
that
lastly,
the
statement
of
law
upon
which
he
predicates
his
claim
for
relief
is
not
in
accordance
either
with
the
statute
or
with
the
decided
cases.
thank
you
sir.
thank
you.
