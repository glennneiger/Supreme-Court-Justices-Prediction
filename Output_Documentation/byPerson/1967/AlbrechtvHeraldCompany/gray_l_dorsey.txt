mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
admitted
resale
price
maintenance.
the
only
question
is,
whether
this
resale
price
maintenance
is
unlawful
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
it
involves
the
control
of
the
retail
price
of
the
globe-democrat
newspaper
to
home
delivery
customers
on
a
suburban
route
in
st.louis.
the
petitioner,
mr.
albrecht
bought
this
route
number
99
in
1956.
in
1961,
the
globe-democrat
took
the
position
that
the
home
delivery
carriers
were
not
employees
but
were
independent
merchants
and
they
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
renew
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
carrier's
union
when
it
expired
in
may
of
1961.
it
did
expire,
it
was
not
renewed.
the
policy
statement
of
the
newspaper
expressly
says
that
in
its
position,
in
its
view,
this
home
delivery
carriers
are
independent
merchants.
they're
not
employees.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
these
--
mr.
justice
black
are
news
carriers,
they
are
adults.
mr.
albrecht
was
42
years
old
when
he
bought
this
route
after
20
years
of
experience
at
home
delivery
services
with
a
bakery
and
with
a
milk
company.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
don't
know
whether
all
of
them
are
but
in
general,
these
are
adult
carriers
and
they're
--
they
have
in
the
neighborhood
about
1200
customers.
they
own
a
truck
and
deliver
from
a
truck.
this
is
not
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
type
of
case.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
honor?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no.
no,
these
are
adult
men.
they
buy
their
papers
at
price
of
course
set
by
the
newspaper.
they
resale
and
they
have
to
pay
all
their
expenses
out
of
the
difference
and
anything
that
they
make
is
--
has
to
come
out
of
the
difference
between
the
price
they
sell
at
and
the
price
that
they
buy.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
albrecht
is
the
only
one
of
whom
i
know.
he
had
employees
occasionally
whom
he
paid
and
his
wife
helped
him
quite
often
with
respect
to
clerical
manners,
people
calling
the
house
in
order
to
make
changes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
whenever
he
had
employees,
he
paid
this
out
of
his
proceeds,
the
difference
between
the
prices
that
he
paid
and
charged.
in
1961,
the
globe-democrat
having
decided
that
it
did
not
chose
to
make
deliveries
to
employees
on
its
some
172
routes
that
one
of
the
deal
of
independent
merchants
nevertheless
wanted
to
control
the
price
at
which
the
customer
bought
the
newspaper.
and
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
amicus
brief
here
or
make
clear
of
why
that
is,
the
charge
that
they
are
able
to
make
for
advertising
depends
on
the
size
of
their
readership
and
therefore
they
want
to
keep
the
price
down
to
their
ultimate
customer
and
get
as
much
readership
as
possible.
they
--
therefore,
the
newspaper
therefore
published
daily
their
suggested
resale
price
in
their
newspaper.
and
in
1961,
this
was
set
at
a
dollar
and
60
cents
a
month
for
the
daily
paper.
mr.
albrecht
charged
a
dollar
and
70
cents
a
month
or
10
cents
a
month
more
for
the
daily
paper
than
the
suggested
resale
price
of
the
globe-democrat
to
persons
who
did
not
pay
in
advance.if
they
paid
in
advance,
he
charged
a
dollar
and
60
cents.
from
time
to
time,
beginning
in
1961,
customers
wouldn't
see
the
suggested
price
in
the
newspaper,
call
into
the
newspaper
office
and
make
a
complaint
that
they
were
charged
a
dollar
70
or
more
than
the
suggested
resale
price.
and
when
this
occurred,
it
was
the
policy
of
the
newspaper,
the
circulation
director,
to
get
in
touch
with
the
carrier,
with
mr.
albrecht
to
warn
him
that
he
was
charging
more
than
their
suggested
price,
to
tell
him
that
they
insisted
that
he
charge
the
suggested
price.
this
happened
from
time
to
time
between
1961
and
may
20,
1964,
on
at
--
on
two
occasions
in
1961
or
1962,
the
circulation
director
talked
by
phone
with
mr.
albrecht.
and
in
1962,
he
also
had
mr.
albrecht
into
the
office
and
discussed
it
with
him.
mr.
albrecht
continued
to
charge
a
dollar
and
70-cent
price,
and
on
may
20,
1964,
the
newspaper
sent
him
a
letter
in
which
they
enclosed
another
letter
which
they
proposed
to
send
to
all
of
the
people
on
--
within
the
territory
of
mr.
albrecht's
route.
now
this
letter
would
inform
these
people
that
they
were
paying
more
than
the
suggested
price
and
would
offer
to
have
the
paper
delivered
to
them
at
the
suggested
price
of
a
dollar
and
60
cents
if
they
chose
to
have
this
done.
on
may
20th,
this
letter
was
sent
out
to
all
of
the
people
in
mr.
albrecht's
route.
it
was
followed
subsequently
by
telephone
solicitation
by
a
circulation
company
mainly
circulation
sales
company,
which
involve
quite
a
number
of
hours
of
calling.
there
were
three
persons
employed,
13
hours
a
day
and
a
director
of
this
company
estimated
that
they
call
for
about
two
weeks.
this
was
followed
up
by
a
door-to-door
solicitation
by
boys
who
were
hired
by
the
circulation
company
and
instructed
by
the
globe-democrat.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
this
was
directed
down
at
the
trial
and
there's
been
no
question
of
it
since
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
the
interstate
commerce
your
honor
is
that
the
news
comes
from
all
over
the
world
and
is
published
in
this
newspaper
and
sold
to
the
readers
in
kirkwood,
and
this
readership
in
kirkwood
is
sold
to
advertisers
in
new
york
and
all
over
the
country.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
the
result
of
this
solicitation
was
according
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
mr.
albrecht
that
people
he'd
known
for
20
years
would
meet
him
on
the
street
and
refuse
to
speak
to
him,
his
customers
call
him
up,
cursed
him,
call
him
a
cheat
and
a
thief,
people
moved
away
from
him
in
church
and
this
was
effective
cooperation
--
or
was
effective
coercion.
for
a
little
over
for
about
three
years
from
1961
to
1964,
the
globe-democrat
had
been
trying
to
persuade
mr.
albrecht
to
charge
a
dollar
and
60
cents
instead
of
a
dollar
70
cents
and
have
not
been
able
to
persuade
him
to
do
so.
within
about
20
days
after
this
solicitation
began,
mr.
albrecht
had
been
subjected
to
this
abuse,
he
had
lost
over
300
of
his
1200
customers
and
he
was
forced
to
reduce
his
price
to
their
suggested
price,
so
you
had
him
clubbed
into
compliance
with
their
resale
price
maintenance
so
there's
no
question
that
this
was
effective
coercion.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
it
was
intended
to
have
the
price
--
the
effect
of
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
evans,
the
circulation
director,
and
mr.
bowman,
the
general
manger
of
the
newspaper,
both
freely
admitted
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
solicitation
was
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
resale
price
maintenance.
now,
it
was
early
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
has
sold.
there
was
subsequent
termination
after
a
suit
was
filed
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
we
think
your
honor
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
coercion
to
get
him
to
bring
the
price
down
because
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
had
brought
it
down.
he
had
not
notified
them
and
he
would
not
agree
in
the
future
to
keep
it
down.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
after
the
customers
had
been
taken
away
from
him
in
july,
there
was
a
conference
between
him
and
the
manager
of
the
newspaper
in
which
they
said
that
everything
would
be
alright
if
he
would
only
charge
their
price.
he
refused
to
charge
their
price,
he
then
saw
his
attorney,
filed
a
suit,
they
terminated,
gave
him
60
days
in
which
to
sell
a
route.
he
brought
in
the
person
who
had
offered
him
$24,000
for
the
route
so
that
they
could
--
the
newspaper
could
approve
his
credit.
and
at
that
time,
in
that
conference
in
september
15
of
1964,
after
the
suit
was
filed
on
august
20,
a
notice
of
termination
went
up
--
august
12,
suit
was
filed,
august
20
notice
of
termination
went
out,
september
15,
when
he
came
out
with
the
pers
--
in
with
a
perspective
new
customer.
at
that
time,
the
newspaper
tried
to
get
him
to
comply
with
their
resale
price,
told
him
that
the
customers
that
had
been
taken
away
would
not
be
returned
for
--
to
him
for
sale,
unless
he
dropped
the
suit.
in
which
case,
he
could
sell
these
customers
as
well
as
the
other
900.
and
furthermore,
if
would
agree
at
that
time,
to
charge
their
resale
price
maintenance,
he
could
come
back
and
again
operate
the
route.
so
coercion
was
continuing
even
after
termination
had
occurred,
notice
of
termination
had
occurred.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
think
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
that's
on
page
45
of
the
record.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
so
we
think
there's
no
question
of
anything
like
simplicity
pattern
case
or
dark
drug
works
outside
the
period
of
coercion.
the
coercion
was
clearly
exercised
after
that
period.
in
order
to
make
delivery
of
--
to
these
customers,
the
newspaper
did
not
go
into
the
carrier
business,
it
was
there
stated
in
their
policy
and
in
depositions,
that
was
the
position
of
the
officers
of
the
newspaper
that
they
had
a
right
to
compete
with
a
carrier
who
is
not
charging
their
resale
price.
this
has
not
seriously
been
argued
in
this
case
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
--
all
of
the
facts
clearly
show
that
under
the
rule
of
good
faith
competition
in
the
restatement
section
709
on
the
early
leading
case,
tuttle
versus
buck,
this
was
not
good
faith
competition.
it's
absolutely
clear
they
were
never
in
the
carrier
business.
they
said
they
didn't
want
to
be
in
the
carrier
business.
when
they
took
these
300
customers
away,
they
didn't
even
assert
any
proprietary
right
over
them.
they
didn't
view
them
as
having
become
their
customers
at
all.
they
advertised
for
another
carrier.
they
deliver
to
these
temporarily,
they
gave
them
to
him
without
any
charge
and
they
told
him,
“we
don't
know
how
long
you'll
have
this.
you
can
take
the
profit
while
you're
delivering
but,
if
albrecht
gets
straightened
up
with
us,
you
will
have
to
give
them
back.”
so
whereas
later
they
said,
“well,
this
belong
to
another
man.
if
you
are
going
to
get
them,
you'll
have
to
buy
them
back.”
at
the
time
they
gave
them
to
kroner,
this
other
carrier,
they
said
it's
only
temporary.
and
if
this
resale
price
maintenance,
if
this
--
albrecht
get
straightened
up
with
us
and
charges
our
price,
you
will
have
to
give
them
back.
so
they
clearly
contemplated
this
as
a
major
coercion
at
the
time
that
it
was
done.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it's
our
view
your
honor
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
soon
as
the
globe-democrat
went
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination,
then
a
combination
came
into
effect
between
the
globe-democrat
and
the
customer,
albrecht.
that
whether
or
not,
although
they
did
entwined
with
him
mainly
circulation
sales
as
other
carrier
who
enabled
them
to
withhold
these
customers
from
albrecht
in
order
to
increase
the
length
of
time
of
this
coercion.
the
customers
themselves
who
certainly
brought
the
coercion
that
whether
or
not,
there
is
an
unlawful
combination
between
the
globe-democrat
and
anyone
or
more
of
these
persons
that
regardless
of
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
result
of
the
coercion
by
the
globe-democrat
on
albrecht.
and
he
is
then
complying
with
that
and
charging
their
price,
if
that
price
is
a
result
of
an
unlawful
combination
consisting
of
the
globe-democrat
and
albrecht.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
it
does
your
honor.
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
if
they
had
coerced
and
he
had
never
lowered.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
is
lower
than
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
kiefer-stewart
was
that
kind
of
a
case
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
kiefer-stewart
was
that
kind
of
a
case
your
honor,
where
the
manufacturers
after
price
controls,
after
the
war
went
off,
they
want
to
keep
the
price
down
in
order
to
sell
more
whiskey.
and
this
court
said,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
evil
is
destroying
the
independent
judgment
of
the
customer.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
time
you're
purportedly
benefiting
the
consumer.
it's
the
power
that's
wrong
because
it
can
be
misused
and
it
should
never
be
there.
it's
a
violation
when
it's
there.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
coming
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
it
can
generally
be
assumed
that
all
parties
are
willing
parties,
and
that
they
are
in
an
agreement
to
fix
price
because
they
see
it
as
to
their
advantage
and
that
they
can
be
counted
upon
to
carry
out
the
agreement
so
there
will
be
this
effect
on
the
price.
with
respect
to
resale
price
maintenance
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
the
seller's
action
is
to
hold
down
his
customer's
price
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
customer
but
to
the
advantage
of
the
seller,
then
the
question
is
extremely
important
what
the
effect
of
coercion
is.
now
in
resale
price
maintenance
cases,
i
think
this
court
has
already
clearly
and
unequivocally
held
that
if
the
seller
by
means
of
coercion
induces
the
cooperative
action
of
third
parties
together
with
him
and
then
brings
this
combination
to
bear
against
the
customer
in
order
to
affect
--
effect
resale
price
maintenance,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
section
1.
i
think
there's
no
question
at
that
sort,
the
beech-nut
case
holds,
there
was
no
finding
of
agreements
there,
only
that
the
coercion
effected
and
arrangement
that
was
the
equivalent
of
an
agreement.
now
then
i
think
it's
absolute
this
court
has
also
absolutely
clearly
and
unequivocally
held
in
the
simpson
case,
simpson
versus
union
oil,
that
if
the
coercion
of
the
seller,
not
involving
third
persons
at
all
but
solely
against
the
buyer,
results
in
the
buyer
signing
his
name
to
a
contract
even
though
it's
against
his
interest
and
whenever
he
can
he
will
not
abide
by
it
and
this
case
came
up
because
he
didn't
abide
by
it.
but
if
that
formality
resulting
from
the
coercion
is
to
sign
a
contract,
then
that
--
he's
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
now
we
have
here
the
case
that
we
ask
the
court
to
hold
because
we
think
that
the
real
protection
to
buyers
and
their
exercise
of
independent
judgment
in
the
resale
price
maintenance
situation
is
to
be
protected
from
the
coercion
not
protected
from
the
coercion
if
they
happened
to
sign
a
contract.
so
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
we
have
objected
to
the
instructions
in
that
they
required
the
finding
of
common
purpose
to
find
the
combination.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor.
we
think
that
was
--
that's
true,
but
we
ask
for
summary
judgment
and
we
think
that
we
should
have
had
it
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no.
i'm
saying
what
happened
below
was
that
we
asked
summary
judgment
and
we
think
there
was
error
in
not
granting
the
summary
judgment.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
then
we
asked
for
a
directed
verdict
but
we
asked
for
summary
judgment
before
they
ever
went
to
trial.
then
we
asked
for
a
directed
verdict.
then
we
asked
for
judgment
n.o.v.
and
we
think
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
were
entitled
a
judgment
n.o.v.that
from
the
time
that
these
facts
were
in
and
it
was
admitted
that
these
things
were
done,
that
if
the
language
of
parke,
davis
means
what
it
says
that
if
a
seller
goes
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sale,
he
has
put
together
an
unlawful
combination.
now
we
think
that
that
language
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
that
coercion
your
honor
goes
beyond
the
very
narrow
permissible
limits
laid
down
in
parke,
davis
namely
prior
announcement
of
price
and
mere
declination
to
sell.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
is.
there's
no
question
about
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
absolute
--
well
not
agreed
but
not
contested
and
practically
all
by
admission
by
depositions.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
those
were
the
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
oh
no,
absolutely
impossible.
those
clearly
are
not
the
facts
your
honor.
they
exercised
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
but
if
there
wasn't
a
fact
--
our
position
is
that
there
really
is
no
fact
question
involved
here,
they
have
never
disputed
that.
they
engaged
in
this
solicitation
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
solicitation
was
to
get
compliance
for
their
resale
price
policy.
their
officers
have
said
this.so
there's
no
question
that
they
did
it
specifically.
they
got
these
customers
specifically
in
order
to
attempt
to
get
compliance
with
their
resale
price.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
they
certainly
could
have
done
that.
that's
our
position
but
they
certainly
did
not
do
that.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
they
did
not
compete
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
exactly.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
he
had
your
honor,
then
of
course
it
wouldn't
--
needed
to
go
to
the
jury
but
these
were
not
the
fact.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
didn't
controvert
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
didn't
controvert
these
facts
at
all.
he
put
on
no
evidence
except
company
policy
and
some
statements
of
that
kind.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
these
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
and
it
turns
on
this
question
of
combination.
does
combination
require
a
common
purpose
with
third
persons?
or
can
it
come
as
a
result
of
an
antagonistic
coercive
relationship
between
the
seller
and
the
buyer,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
decide
that
it
can
because
we
think
in
this
situation,
that's
the
only
real
protection
of
the
independent
judgment
of
the
customer
but
we
feel
that
in
any
event
whether
or
not
the
court
wishes
to
rule
that
way,
that
in
any
event
there
are
certain
--
the
facts
here
show
that
there
certainly
is
sufficient
relationship
between
the
globe-democrat,
mainly
circulation
sales,
the
customers
of
albrecht
and
kroner,
the
other
carrier
so
that
whether
this
is
ruled
or
not,
there
was
a
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
should
have
given
us
a
direct
verdict
either
on
the
view
that
there
is
a
combination
between
globe-democrat
and
albrecht
or
on
the
view
that
the
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
beyond
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
we
did
present
that.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon
if
it
wasn't
clear.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
in
that
--
the
language
on
page
43
expressly
says
that.
now
in
your
opinion
where
you
subsequently
point
out
but
there
is
in
the
facts
of
parke,
davis
that
show
there
is
a
going
too
far.
there,
these
are
in
terms
of
parke,
davis
in
relationship
between
parke,
davis
and
the
wholesalers,
and
the
relationship
between
parke,
davis
in
some
of
the
retailers
against
other
retailers.
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
we're
here
with
this
case.
that
it's
a
question
of
what
the
meaning
of
that
language
is.
if
there
is
a
going
beyond
not
by
establishing
a
relationship
with
third
parties
even
if
that's
coercively
established.
but
if
there
is
a
going
beyond
by
a
coercive
relationship
with
the
customer,
that
controls
his
price
which
i
read
literally
that
language
to
me.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
provide
protection
on
the
buyer's
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
this
is
of
course,
your
honor
the
hard
marginal
case
and
it
would
simply
be
a
question
under
all
the
equities
if
there
was
generally
fair
treatment
whether
you
would
view
this
as
the
reminder
as
being
part
of
the
prior
announcement
in
the
facts.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
may
be
but
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
may
be
that
he
can
do
a
very
little
bit
but
he
has
done
a
very
great
deal
more
than
what
you
suggest
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
would
have
to
take
a
look
at
that
your
honor
when
it
came
up.
i
would
suppose
that
this
might
post
a
question
of
a
--
an
attempt
to
violate
rather
than
an
actual
violation
and
you
certainly
would
not
have
as
clear
a
case
as
you
have
here
where
the
action
has
been
engaged
been
and
has
exercised
the
coercion
and
the
effect
has
been
had
on
the
resale
price.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
they
have
the
right
to
compete
but
if
they
did
not
compete,
they
did
not
themselves
go
out
into
this
territory
and
go
door-to-door
and
try
to
get
their
own
customers
at
a
dollar
and
60
cents.
and
they
did
not
say
to
another
carrier,
we
will
sell
you
if
you
worked
up
a
customer
lives.
but
they
went
to
the
customers
of
albrecht
and
they
said,
“he's
overcharging
you.”
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well
it
clearly
would
not
be
permissible
if
their
very
purpose
is
to
bring
pressure
on
albrecht
in
order
to
coerce
him
to
comply
with
their
resale
price
policy
which
was
the
case
here,
admittedly
so.
they
say,
“this
is
why
we
did.”
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
breadth
left
in
colgate
was
the
breadth
left
in
that
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
parke,
davis
opinion,
that
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sell
and
beyond
that
colgate
expires.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
between
what,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor,
we
did
not
say
that
that's
unlawful
and
the
globe-democrat
did
that
for
three
years,
they
tried
to
persuade
for
three
years.
and
mr.
albrecht
was
unmovable
and
insisted
that
he
had
the
right
to
charge
his
own
price.
they
didn't
move
him
by
persuasion
and
by
threats,
that
we
won't
tolerate
this
and
by
statements
that
you
must
follow
our
price.
what
moved
him
was
when
they
took
away
300
of
his
customers
and
cost
his
customers
to
call
him
a
cheat
and
a
thief.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
our
brief,
pages
13
and
32,
i
think
that
there
is
the
answer
to
the
question
that
you
raised
awhile
ago
but
mr.
hocker
is
correct
that
in
our
prayer
we
did
not
asked
alternatively
for
a
new
trial.
we
didn't
allege
that
there
was
error
in
the
instructions
when
it
went
to
trial.
but
our
feeling
was
that
a
--
since
all
of
the
facts
are
there,
there's
no
factual
question
to
be
decided
that
there
would
be
no
question
sending
--
there's
no
point
in
sending
this
back
for
a
new
trial
but
--
and
so
we
asked
direction
that
you
direct
that
judgment
be
added
for
petitioner
on
the
liability
in
the
new
trial
solely
on
damages.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
i
don't
to
see
at
the
moment
how
reasonable
would
it
come
in
except
in
the
kind
of
situation
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
me
about,
could
they
do
a
little
something
more
than
just
terminate.
i
think
it
might
very
well
commend
it.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
i
simply
would
be
--
i
think
that
applies
in
this
way
that
it
is
unreasonable
per
se
when
price
fixing
has
occurred
and
there's
no
need
to
inquire
whether
this
price-fixing
affected
a
substantial
amount
of
the
market
and
that's
their
--
i
think
there's
no
need
to
inquire
in
this
case
with
respect
to
that.
this
matter
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
treble-damage
action,
i
really
think
that
there's
nothing
substantial
there.
over
a
hundred
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
punitive
damage
has
been
a
part
of
the
civil
law
for
over
a
hundred
years
at
that
time
so
that
for
more
than
200
years,
it's
been
accepted.
it's
logically
somewhat
anomalist
but
it's
a
good
bargain
to
get
at
the
expense
--
slight
expense
of
logic
to
get
a
doctrine
that
has
been
useful
and
has
been
used
for
over
200
years.
in
the
house
of
lords
in
1964
did
reconsider
on
the
merits
and
decided
to
leave
it
in
as
a
part
of
the
civil
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
hocker
is
not
correct
that
the
carriers
wrote
--
the
carrier's
business
manager
wrote
to
the
business
manager
of
the
newspaper,
called
attention
of
the
fact
that
the
contract
expiration
date
was
coming
up
on
february
16
of
1954.
and
on
february
17,
wrote
offering
to
negotiate
for
a
new
contract
and
that
the
newspaper
wrote.
then
shortly
before
that
expiration
date
in
may
saying
they
would
not
negotiate
because
the
carriers
are
independent
merchants.
now,
i
think
really
this
argument
that
they
didn't
go
beyond
because
they
were
more
kind
to
albrecht
that
--
is
really
ridiculous.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
they
were
kind
to
him.
it's
a
question
of
whether
in
the
matter
of
coercion
they
went
beyond
announcement
and
declination.
they
clearly
did
go
beyond
even
if
it
were
disastrous
for
albrecht
to
stand
on
his
right,
he
had
the
right.
and
furthermore,
it
was
not
disastrous
because
it
misrepresents
to
say
that
by
refusing
the
sell
to
him,
they
wiped
out
his
investment.
they
don't
wipeout
his
investment,
he
owns
the
route.
the
contracts
to
deliver
to
those
people
in
kirkwood
belong
to
him.
he
bought
them
from
the
previous
man.
he
had
the
right
to
sell
them
to
the
next
man
and
he
did
sell
it.
it
wasn't
any
great
act
of
kindness
to
give
him
60
days
to
sell
them.
they
didn't
have
anyone
who
had
the
right
to
deliver
to
those
people
and
they
could
only
agree
to
sell
to
someone
who
did
have
that
right
and
that
man
could
only
get
that
right
from
albrecht.
now,
it's
true
that
the
newspaper
has
the
need
to
control
price
because
of
their
short
shelf
life.
they
certainly
could
do
it.
they
could
hire
employees.
they
could
plan
employee's
benefits.
they
could
ensure
the
job
security
that
the
union
contract
ensures.
they
have
been
so
kind
to
albrecht
that
at
the
age
of
50,
he's
out
of
work.
he's
done
nothing
except
home
delivery
work
for
28
years.
he's
50
years
old,
now
he's
terminated,
he
doesn't
have
a
job.
if
they
want
to
ensure
that
they
can
charge
the
price,
they
can
hire
employees
and
deliver
it.
kroner's
--
was
instructed
at
the
time
that
he
took
over
these
300
customers,
that
of
course
you
know
what
our
policy
is,
and
it
was
clear
that
he
understood
that
the
condition
of
taking
over
these
customers
was
that
he
would
follow
this
resale
price.
so
our
position
is
your
honor
is
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
that
the
coercion
has
clearly
gone
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sell
that
the
real
protection
of
people
in
this
situation
would
be
for
this
court
unequivocally
to
rule
that
coerced
this
antagonistic
coercive
relationship
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
alone
gives
rise
to
an
unlawful
combination
that
that
in
any
event
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
so
rule,
that
there
is
the
relationship
between
the
globe-democrat,
the
customers
of
albrecht,
the
circulation
company
and
the
other
carrier,
kroner,
that
establishes
a
sufficient
combination
between
them
so
that
in
this
instance,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
in
any
event.
we
feel
that
the
only
thing
--
that
there's
no
need
for
a
new
trial
which
should
be
directed
on
the
matter
of
liability.
thank
you.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
admitted
resale
price
maintenance.
the
only
question
is,
whether
this
resale
price
maintenance
is
unlawful
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
it
involves
the
control
of
the
retail
price
of
the
globe-democrat
newspaper
to
home
delivery
customers
on
a
suburban
route
in
st.louis.
the
petitioner,
mr.
albrecht
bought
this
route
number
99
in
1956.
in
1961,
the
globe-democrat
took
the
position
that
the
home
delivery
carriers
were
not
employees
but
were
independent
merchants
and
they
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
renew
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
carrier's
union
when
it
expired
in
may
of
1961.
it
did
expire,
it
was
not
renewed.
the
policy
statement
of
the
newspaper
expressly
says
that
in
its
position,
in
its
view,
this
home
delivery
carriers
are
independent
merchants.
they're
not
employees.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
these
--
mr.
justice
black
are
news
carriers,
they
are
adults.
mr.
albrecht
was
42
years
old
when
he
bought
this
route
after
20
years
of
experience
at
home
delivery
services
with
a
bakery
and
with
a
milk
company.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
don't
know
whether
all
of
them
are
but
in
general,
these
are
adult
carriers
and
they're
--
they
have
in
the
neighborhood
about
1200
customers.
they
own
a
truck
and
deliver
from
a
truck.
this
is
not
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
type
of
case.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
honor?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no.
no,
these
are
adult
men.
they
buy
their
papers
at
price
of
course
set
by
the
newspaper.
they
resale
and
they
have
to
pay
all
their
expenses
out
of
the
difference
and
anything
that
they
make
is
--
has
to
come
out
of
the
difference
between
the
price
they
sell
at
and
the
price
that
they
buy.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
albrecht
is
the
only
one
of
whom
i
know.
he
had
employees
occasionally
whom
he
paid
and
his
wife
helped
him
quite
often
with
respect
to
clerical
manners,
people
calling
the
house
in
order
to
make
changes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
whenever
he
had
employees,
he
paid
this
out
of
his
proceeds,
the
difference
between
the
prices
that
he
paid
and
charged.
in
1961,
the
globe-democrat
having
decided
that
it
did
not
chose
to
make
deliveries
to
employees
on
its
some
172
routes
that
one
of
the
deal
of
independent
merchants
nevertheless
wanted
to
control
the
price
at
which
the
customer
bought
the
newspaper.
and
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
amicus
brief
here
or
make
clear
of
why
that
is,
the
charge
that
they
are
able
to
make
for
advertising
depends
on
the
size
of
their
readership
and
therefore
they
want
to
keep
the
price
down
to
their
ultimate
customer
and
get
as
much
readership
as
possible.
they
--
therefore,
the
newspaper
therefore
published
daily
their
suggested
resale
price
in
their
newspaper.
and
in
1961,
this
was
set
at
a
dollar
and
60
cents
a
month
for
the
daily
paper.
mr.
albrecht
charged
a
dollar
and
70
cents
a
month
or
10
cents
a
month
more
for
the
daily
paper
than
the
suggested
resale
price
of
the
globe-democrat
to
persons
who
did
not
pay
in
advance.if
they
paid
in
advance,
he
charged
a
dollar
and
60
cents.
from
time
to
time,
beginning
in
1961,
customers
wouldn't
see
the
suggested
price
in
the
newspaper,
call
into
the
newspaper
office
and
make
a
complaint
that
they
were
charged
a
dollar
70
or
more
than
the
suggested
resale
price.
and
when
this
occurred,
it
was
the
policy
of
the
newspaper,
the
circulation
director,
to
get
in
touch
with
the
carrier,
with
mr.
albrecht
to
warn
him
that
he
was
charging
more
than
their
suggested
price,
to
tell
him
that
they
insisted
that
he
charge
the
suggested
price.
this
happened
from
time
to
time
between
1961
and
may
20,
1964,
on
at
--
on
two
occasions
in
1961
or
1962,
the
circulation
director
talked
by
phone
with
mr.
albrecht.
and
in
1962,
he
also
had
mr.
albrecht
into
the
office
and
discussed
it
with
him.
mr.
albrecht
continued
to
charge
a
dollar
and
70-cent
price,
and
on
may
20,
1964,
the
newspaper
sent
him
a
letter
in
which
they
enclosed
another
letter
which
they
proposed
to
send
to
all
of
the
people
on
--
within
the
territory
of
mr.
albrecht's
route.
now
this
letter
would
inform
these
people
that
they
were
paying
more
than
the
suggested
price
and
would
offer
to
have
the
paper
delivered
to
them
at
the
suggested
price
of
a
dollar
and
60
cents
if
they
chose
to
have
this
done.
on
may
20th,
this
letter
was
sent
out
to
all
of
the
people
in
mr.
albrecht's
route.
it
was
followed
subsequently
by
telephone
solicitation
by
a
circulation
company
mainly
circulation
sales
company,
which
involve
quite
a
number
of
hours
of
calling.
there
were
three
persons
employed,
13
hours
a
day
and
a
director
of
this
company
estimated
that
they
call
for
about
two
weeks.
this
was
followed
up
by
a
door-to-door
solicitation
by
boys
who
were
hired
by
the
circulation
company
and
instructed
by
the
globe-democrat.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
this
was
directed
down
at
the
trial
and
there's
been
no
question
of
it
since
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
the
interstate
commerce
your
honor
is
that
the
news
comes
from
all
over
the
world
and
is
published
in
this
newspaper
and
sold
to
the
readers
in
kirkwood,
and
this
readership
in
kirkwood
is
sold
to
advertisers
in
new
york
and
all
over
the
country.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
the
result
of
this
solicitation
was
according
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
mr.
albrecht
that
people
he'd
known
for
20
years
would
meet
him
on
the
street
and
refuse
to
speak
to
him,
his
customers
call
him
up,
cursed
him,
call
him
a
cheat
and
a
thief,
people
moved
away
from
him
in
church
and
this
was
effective
cooperation
--
or
was
effective
coercion.
for
a
little
over
for
about
three
years
from
1961
to
1964,
the
globe-democrat
had
been
trying
to
persuade
mr.
albrecht
to
charge
a
dollar
and
60
cents
instead
of
a
dollar
70
cents
and
have
not
been
able
to
persuade
him
to
do
so.
within
about
20
days
after
this
solicitation
began,
mr.
albrecht
had
been
subjected
to
this
abuse,
he
had
lost
over
300
of
his
1200
customers
and
he
was
forced
to
reduce
his
price
to
their
suggested
price,
so
you
had
him
clubbed
into
compliance
with
their
resale
price
maintenance
so
there's
no
question
that
this
was
effective
coercion.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
it
was
intended
to
have
the
price
--
the
effect
of
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
evans,
the
circulation
director,
and
mr.
bowman,
the
general
manger
of
the
newspaper,
both
freely
admitted
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
solicitation
was
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
resale
price
maintenance.
now,
it
was
early
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
has
sold.
there
was
subsequent
termination
after
a
suit
was
filed
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
we
think
your
honor
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
coercion
to
get
him
to
bring
the
price
down
because
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
had
brought
it
down.
he
had
not
notified
them
and
he
would
not
agree
in
the
future
to
keep
it
down.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
after
the
customers
had
been
taken
away
from
him
in
july,
there
was
a
conference
between
him
and
the
manager
of
the
newspaper
in
which
they
said
that
everything
would
be
alright
if
he
would
only
charge
their
price.
he
refused
to
charge
their
price,
he
then
saw
his
attorney,
filed
a
suit,
they
terminated,
gave
him
60
days
in
which
to
sell
a
route.
he
brought
in
the
person
who
had
offered
him
$24,000
for
the
route
so
that
they
could
--
the
newspaper
could
approve
his
credit.
and
at
that
time,
in
that
conference
in
september
15
of
1964,
after
the
suit
was
filed
on
august
20,
a
notice
of
termination
went
up
--
august
12,
suit
was
filed,
august
20
notice
of
termination
went
out,
september
15,
when
he
came
out
with
the
pers
--
in
with
a
perspective
new
customer.
at
that
time,
the
newspaper
tried
to
get
him
to
comply
with
their
resale
price,
told
him
that
the
customers
that
had
been
taken
away
would
not
be
returned
for
--
to
him
for
sale,
unless
he
dropped
the
suit.
in
which
case,
he
could
sell
these
customers
as
well
as
the
other
900.
and
furthermore,
if
would
agree
at
that
time,
to
charge
their
resale
price
maintenance,
he
could
come
back
and
again
operate
the
route.
so
coercion
was
continuing
even
after
termination
had
occurred,
notice
of
termination
had
occurred.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
think
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
that's
on
page
45
of
the
record.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
so
we
think
there's
no
question
of
anything
like
simplicity
pattern
case
or
dark
drug
works
outside
the
period
of
coercion.
the
coercion
was
clearly
exercised
after
that
period.
in
order
to
make
delivery
of
--
to
these
customers,
the
newspaper
did
not
go
into
the
carrier
business,
it
was
there
stated
in
their
policy
and
in
depositions,
that
was
the
position
of
the
officers
of
the
newspaper
that
they
had
a
right
to
compete
with
a
carrier
who
is
not
charging
their
resale
price.
this
has
not
seriously
been
argued
in
this
case
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
--
all
of
the
facts
clearly
show
that
under
the
rule
of
good
faith
competition
in
the
restatement
section
709
on
the
early
leading
case,
tuttle
versus
buck,
this
was
not
good
faith
competition.
it's
absolutely
clear
they
were
never
in
the
carrier
business.
they
said
they
didn't
want
to
be
in
the
carrier
business.
when
they
took
these
300
customers
away,
they
didn't
even
assert
any
proprietary
right
over
them.
they
didn't
view
them
as
having
become
their
customers
at
all.
they
advertised
for
another
carrier.
they
deliver
to
these
temporarily,
they
gave
them
to
him
without
any
charge
and
they
told
him,
“we
don't
know
how
long
you'll
have
this.
you
can
take
the
profit
while
you're
delivering
but,
if
albrecht
gets
straightened
up
with
us,
you
will
have
to
give
them
back.”
so
whereas
later
they
said,
“well,
this
belong
to
another
man.
if
you
are
going
to
get
them,
you'll
have
to
buy
them
back.”
at
the
time
they
gave
them
to
kroner,
this
other
carrier,
they
said
it's
only
temporary.
and
if
this
resale
price
maintenance,
if
this
--
albrecht
get
straightened
up
with
us
and
charges
our
price,
you
will
have
to
give
them
back.
so
they
clearly
contemplated
this
as
a
major
coercion
at
the
time
that
it
was
done.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it's
our
view
your
honor
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
soon
as
the
globe-democrat
went
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination,
then
a
combination
came
into
effect
between
the
globe-democrat
and
the
customer,
albrecht.
that
whether
or
not,
although
they
did
entwined
with
him
mainly
circulation
sales
as
other
carrier
who
enabled
them
to
withhold
these
customers
from
albrecht
in
order
to
increase
the
length
of
time
of
this
coercion.
the
customers
themselves
who
certainly
brought
the
coercion
that
whether
or
not,
there
is
an
unlawful
combination
between
the
globe-democrat
and
anyone
or
more
of
these
persons
that
regardless
of
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
result
of
the
coercion
by
the
globe-democrat
on
albrecht.
and
he
is
then
complying
with
that
and
charging
their
price,
if
that
price
is
a
result
of
an
unlawful
combination
consisting
of
the
globe-democrat
and
albrecht.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
it
does
your
honor.
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
if
they
had
coerced
and
he
had
never
lowered.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
is
lower
than
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
kiefer-stewart
was
that
kind
of
a
case
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
kiefer-stewart
was
that
kind
of
a
case
your
honor,
where
the
manufacturers
after
price
controls,
after
the
war
went
off,
they
want
to
keep
the
price
down
in
order
to
sell
more
whiskey.
and
this
court
said,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
evil
is
destroying
the
independent
judgment
of
the
customer.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
time
you're
purportedly
benefiting
the
consumer.
it's
the
power
that's
wrong
because
it
can
be
misused
and
it
should
never
be
there.
it's
a
violation
when
it's
there.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
coming
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
it
can
generally
be
assumed
that
all
parties
are
willing
parties,
and
that
they
are
in
an
agreement
to
fix
price
because
they
see
it
as
to
their
advantage
and
that
they
can
be
counted
upon
to
carry
out
the
agreement
so
there
will
be
this
effect
on
the
price.
with
respect
to
resale
price
maintenance
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
the
seller's
action
is
to
hold
down
his
customer's
price
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
customer
but
to
the
advantage
of
the
seller,
then
the
question
is
extremely
important
what
the
effect
of
coercion
is.
now
in
resale
price
maintenance
cases,
i
think
this
court
has
already
clearly
and
unequivocally
held
that
if
the
seller
by
means
of
coercion
induces
the
cooperative
action
of
third
parties
together
with
him
and
then
brings
this
combination
to
bear
against
the
customer
in
order
to
affect
--
effect
resale
price
maintenance,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
section
1.
i
think
there's
no
question
at
that
sort,
the
beech-nut
case
holds,
there
was
no
finding
of
agreements
there,
only
that
the
coercion
effected
and
arrangement
that
was
the
equivalent
of
an
agreement.
now
then
i
think
it's
absolute
this
court
has
also
absolutely
clearly
and
unequivocally
held
in
the
simpson
case,
simpson
versus
union
oil,
that
if
the
coercion
of
the
seller,
not
involving
third
persons
at
all
but
solely
against
the
buyer,
results
in
the
buyer
signing
his
name
to
a
contract
even
though
it's
against
his
interest
and
whenever
he
can
he
will
not
abide
by
it
and
this
case
came
up
because
he
didn't
abide
by
it.
but
if
that
formality
resulting
from
the
coercion
is
to
sign
a
contract,
then
that
--
he's
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
now
we
have
here
the
case
that
we
ask
the
court
to
hold
because
we
think
that
the
real
protection
to
buyers
and
their
exercise
of
independent
judgment
in
the
resale
price
maintenance
situation
is
to
be
protected
from
the
coercion
not
protected
from
the
coercion
if
they
happened
to
sign
a
contract.
so
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
we
have
objected
to
the
instructions
in
that
they
required
the
finding
of
common
purpose
to
find
the
combination.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor.
we
think
that
was
--
that's
true,
but
we
ask
for
summary
judgment
and
we
think
that
we
should
have
had
it
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no.
i'm
saying
what
happened
below
was
that
we
asked
summary
judgment
and
we
think
there
was
error
in
not
granting
the
summary
judgment.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
and
then
we
asked
for
a
directed
verdict
but
we
asked
for
summary
judgment
before
they
ever
went
to
trial.
then
we
asked
for
a
directed
verdict.
then
we
asked
for
judgment
n.o.v.
and
we
think
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
were
entitled
a
judgment
n.o.v.that
from
the
time
that
these
facts
were
in
and
it
was
admitted
that
these
things
were
done,
that
if
the
language
of
parke,
davis
means
what
it
says
that
if
a
seller
goes
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sale,
he
has
put
together
an
unlawful
combination.
now
we
think
that
that
language
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
that
coercion
your
honor
goes
beyond
the
very
narrow
permissible
limits
laid
down
in
parke,
davis
namely
prior
announcement
of
price
and
mere
declination
to
sell.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
is.
there's
no
question
about
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
absolute
--
well
not
agreed
but
not
contested
and
practically
all
by
admission
by
depositions.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
those
were
the
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
oh
no,
absolutely
impossible.
those
clearly
are
not
the
facts
your
honor.
they
exercised
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
but
if
there
wasn't
a
fact
--
our
position
is
that
there
really
is
no
fact
question
involved
here,
they
have
never
disputed
that.
they
engaged
in
this
solicitation
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
solicitation
was
to
get
compliance
for
their
resale
price
policy.
their
officers
have
said
this.so
there's
no
question
that
they
did
it
specifically.
they
got
these
customers
specifically
in
order
to
attempt
to
get
compliance
with
their
resale
price.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
they
certainly
could
have
done
that.
that's
our
position
but
they
certainly
did
not
do
that.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
they
did
not
compete
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
exactly.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
if
he
had
your
honor,
then
of
course
it
wouldn't
--
needed
to
go
to
the
jury
but
these
were
not
the
fact.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
didn't
controvert
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
he
didn't
controvert
these
facts
at
all.
he
put
on
no
evidence
except
company
policy
and
some
statements
of
that
kind.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
these
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
and
it
turns
on
this
question
of
combination.
does
combination
require
a
common
purpose
with
third
persons?
or
can
it
come
as
a
result
of
an
antagonistic
coercive
relationship
between
the
seller
and
the
buyer,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
decide
that
it
can
because
we
think
in
this
situation,
that's
the
only
real
protection
of
the
independent
judgment
of
the
customer
but
we
feel
that
in
any
event
whether
or
not
the
court
wishes
to
rule
that
way,
that
in
any
event
there
are
certain
--
the
facts
here
show
that
there
certainly
is
sufficient
relationship
between
the
globe-democrat,
mainly
circulation
sales,
the
customers
of
albrecht
and
kroner,
the
other
carrier
so
that
whether
this
is
ruled
or
not,
there
was
a
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
should
have
given
us
a
direct
verdict
either
on
the
view
that
there
is
a
combination
between
globe-democrat
and
albrecht
or
on
the
view
that
the
facts
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
--
beyond
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes,
we
did
present
that.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon
if
it
wasn't
clear.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
in
that
--
the
language
on
page
43
expressly
says
that.
now
in
your
opinion
where
you
subsequently
point
out
but
there
is
in
the
facts
of
parke,
davis
that
show
there
is
a
going
too
far.
there,
these
are
in
terms
of
parke,
davis
in
relationship
between
parke,
davis
and
the
wholesalers,
and
the
relationship
between
parke,
davis
in
some
of
the
retailers
against
other
retailers.
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
we're
here
with
this
case.
that
it's
a
question
of
what
the
meaning
of
that
language
is.
if
there
is
a
going
beyond
not
by
establishing
a
relationship
with
third
parties
even
if
that's
coercively
established.
but
if
there
is
a
going
beyond
by
a
coercive
relationship
with
the
customer,
that
controls
his
price
which
i
read
literally
that
language
to
me.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
provide
protection
on
the
buyer's
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
this
is
of
course,
your
honor
the
hard
marginal
case
and
it
would
simply
be
a
question
under
all
the
equities
if
there
was
generally
fair
treatment
whether
you
would
view
this
as
the
reminder
as
being
part
of
the
prior
announcement
in
the
facts.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
may
be
but
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
it
may
be
that
he
can
do
a
very
little
bit
but
he
has
done
a
very
great
deal
more
than
what
you
suggest
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
would
have
to
take
a
look
at
that
your
honor
when
it
came
up.
i
would
suppose
that
this
might
post
a
question
of
a
--
an
attempt
to
violate
rather
than
an
actual
violation
and
you
certainly
would
not
have
as
clear
a
case
as
you
have
here
where
the
action
has
been
engaged
been
and
has
exercised
the
coercion
and
the
effect
has
been
had
on
the
resale
price.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
they
have
the
right
to
compete
but
if
they
did
not
compete,
they
did
not
themselves
go
out
into
this
territory
and
go
door-to-door
and
try
to
get
their
own
customers
at
a
dollar
and
60
cents.
and
they
did
not
say
to
another
carrier,
we
will
sell
you
if
you
worked
up
a
customer
lives.
but
they
went
to
the
customers
of
albrecht
and
they
said,
“he's
overcharging
you.”
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well
it
clearly
would
not
be
permissible
if
their
very
purpose
is
to
bring
pressure
on
albrecht
in
order
to
coerce
him
to
comply
with
their
resale
price
policy
which
was
the
case
here,
admittedly
so.
they
say,
“this
is
why
we
did.”
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
breadth
left
in
colgate
was
the
breadth
left
in
that
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
parke,
davis
opinion,
that
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sell
and
beyond
that
colgate
expires.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
between
what,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
no
your
honor,
we
did
not
say
that
that's
unlawful
and
the
globe-democrat
did
that
for
three
years,
they
tried
to
persuade
for
three
years.
and
mr.
albrecht
was
unmovable
and
insisted
that
he
had
the
right
to
charge
his
own
price.
they
didn't
move
him
by
persuasion
and
by
threats,
that
we
won't
tolerate
this
and
by
statements
that
you
must
follow
our
price.
what
moved
him
was
when
they
took
away
300
of
his
customers
and
cost
his
customers
to
call
him
a
cheat
and
a
thief.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
our
brief,
pages
13
and
32,
i
think
that
there
is
the
answer
to
the
question
that
you
raised
awhile
ago
but
mr.
hocker
is
correct
that
in
our
prayer
we
did
not
asked
alternatively
for
a
new
trial.
we
didn't
allege
that
there
was
error
in
the
instructions
when
it
went
to
trial.
but
our
feeling
was
that
a
--
since
all
of
the
facts
are
there,
there's
no
factual
question
to
be
decided
that
there
would
be
no
question
sending
--
there's
no
point
in
sending
this
back
for
a
new
trial
but
--
and
so
we
asked
direction
that
you
direct
that
judgment
be
added
for
petitioner
on
the
liability
in
the
new
trial
solely
on
damages.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
i
don't
to
see
at
the
moment
how
reasonable
would
it
come
in
except
in
the
kind
of
situation
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
me
about,
could
they
do
a
little
something
more
than
just
terminate.
i
think
it
might
very
well
commend
it.
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
gray
l.
dorsey
well,
i
simply
would
be
--
i
think
that
applies
in
this
way
that
it
is
unreasonable
per
se
when
price
fixing
has
occurred
and
there's
no
need
to
inquire
whether
this
price-fixing
affected
a
substantial
amount
of
the
market
and
that's
their
--
i
think
there's
no
need
to
inquire
in
this
case
with
respect
to
that.
this
matter
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
treble-damage
action,
i
really
think
that
there's
nothing
substantial
there.
over
a
hundred
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
punitive
damage
has
been
a
part
of
the
civil
law
for
over
a
hundred
years
at
that
time
so
that
for
more
than
200
years,
it's
been
accepted.
it's
logically
somewhat
anomalist
but
it's
a
good
bargain
to
get
at
the
expense
--
slight
expense
of
logic
to
get
a
doctrine
that
has
been
useful
and
has
been
used
for
over
200
years.
in
the
house
of
lords
in
1964
did
reconsider
on
the
merits
and
decided
to
leave
it
in
as
a
part
of
the
civil
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
hocker
is
not
correct
that
the
carriers
wrote
--
the
carrier's
business
manager
wrote
to
the
business
manager
of
the
newspaper,
called
attention
of
the
fact
that
the
contract
expiration
date
was
coming
up
on
february
16
of
1954.
and
on
february
17,
wrote
offering
to
negotiate
for
a
new
contract
and
that
the
newspaper
wrote.
then
shortly
before
that
expiration
date
in
may
saying
they
would
not
negotiate
because
the
carriers
are
independent
merchants.
now,
i
think
really
this
argument
that
they
didn't
go
beyond
because
they
were
more
kind
to
albrecht
that
--
is
really
ridiculous.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
they
were
kind
to
him.
it's
a
question
of
whether
in
the
matter
of
coercion
they
went
beyond
announcement
and
declination.
they
clearly
did
go
beyond
even
if
it
were
disastrous
for
albrecht
to
stand
on
his
right,
he
had
the
right.
and
furthermore,
it
was
not
disastrous
because
it
misrepresents
to
say
that
by
refusing
the
sell
to
him,
they
wiped
out
his
investment.
they
don't
wipeout
his
investment,
he
owns
the
route.
the
contracts
to
deliver
to
those
people
in
kirkwood
belong
to
him.
he
bought
them
from
the
previous
man.
he
had
the
right
to
sell
them
to
the
next
man
and
he
did
sell
it.
it
wasn't
any
great
act
of
kindness
to
give
him
60
days
to
sell
them.
they
didn't
have
anyone
who
had
the
right
to
deliver
to
those
people
and
they
could
only
agree
to
sell
to
someone
who
did
have
that
right
and
that
man
could
only
get
that
right
from
albrecht.
now,
it's
true
that
the
newspaper
has
the
need
to
control
price
because
of
their
short
shelf
life.
they
certainly
could
do
it.
they
could
hire
employees.
they
could
plan
employee's
benefits.
they
could
ensure
the
job
security
that
the
union
contract
ensures.
they
have
been
so
kind
to
albrecht
that
at
the
age
of
50,
he's
out
of
work.
he's
done
nothing
except
home
delivery
work
for
28
years.
he's
50
years
old,
now
he's
terminated,
he
doesn't
have
a
job.
if
they
want
to
ensure
that
they
can
charge
the
price,
they
can
hire
employees
and
deliver
it.
kroner's
--
was
instructed
at
the
time
that
he
took
over
these
300
customers,
that
of
course
you
know
what
our
policy
is,
and
it
was
clear
that
he
understood
that
the
condition
of
taking
over
these
customers
was
that
he
would
follow
this
resale
price.
so
our
position
is
your
honor
is
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
that
the
coercion
has
clearly
gone
beyond
prior
announcement
and
mere
declination
to
sell
that
the
real
protection
of
people
in
this
situation
would
be
for
this
court
unequivocally
to
rule
that
coerced
this
antagonistic
coercive
relationship
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
alone
gives
rise
to
an
unlawful
combination
that
that
in
any
event
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
so
rule,
that
there
is
the
relationship
between
the
globe-democrat,
the
customers
of
albrecht,
the
circulation
company
and
the
other
carrier,
kroner,
that
establishes
a
sufficient
combination
between
them
so
that
in
this
instance,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
in
any
event.
we
feel
that
the
only
thing
--
that
there's
no
need
for
a
new
trial
which
should
be
directed
on
the
matter
of
liability.
thank
you.
