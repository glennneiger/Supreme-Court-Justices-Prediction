justice

may
i
ask
you
mr.
dorsey.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
a
jury
verdict
against
you?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
object
to
the
instructions?
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
--
how
would
you
state
your
--
the
legal
point
that
you're
presenting
to
us
that
the
instruction,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
because
the
instructions
were
faulty
would
concur
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
the
summary
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
summary
--
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
you
mean
we
ought
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
your
really
asking
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
do
then
is
to
rule
that
in
any
resale
price
fixing
case,
any
resale
price
fixing
case,
the
court
should
as
a
matter
of
law
take
the
case
away
from
the
jury
except
on
the
question
of
damages
where
there
is
coercion
as
between
the
defendant
and
his
customer.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
everything
here
is
conceded
then,
all
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
the
facts
are
considered
and
agreed?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
your
adversary
will
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
provision
here
whatever
that
all
they
did
was
to
offer
mr.
albrecht
an
opportunity
to
comply
with
company
policy
and
that
upon
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
company
policy,
they
unilaterally
terminated
their
arrangement
with
him
and
proceeded
to
take
other
measures
to
satisfy
the
people
who
wanted
to
buy
the
product.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
they
--
yes,
what
i
say,
it
--
won't
they
say
that
those
effects
and
--
isn't
the
--
is
that
something
that
a
jury
might
have
found?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
as
you
say
and
they
say
--
let
me
just
assume
for
the
moment,
i
don't
know
if
it's
true
or
not.let
me
assume
for
the
moment,
they
say
that
contrary
don't
we
usually
submit
that
to
the
jury
under
appropriate
instructions?
justice
abe
fortas
of
course,
just
did
what?
so
the
least
arguable
that
they
could
have
--
mr.
albrecht
said,
“i
want
to
sell
this
for
a
dollar
70
cents”
or
whatever
it
is,
and
its
at
least
arguable
that
the
globe-democrat
could
have
said,
“well,
we're
so
sorry
mr.
albrecht,
if
that's
what
you're
going
to
do
we
just
wanted
some
--
we're
just
going
to
select
somebody
else
to
whom
we'll
sell
the
paper".
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
they
did
do
not
do
that.but
what
they've
did
was
to
adopt
various
techniques
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
mr.
albrecht
to
resell
after
suggested
resale
price.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
suggest
--
is
asking
you
this
question,
supposed
your
adversary
should
say,
"i
don't
know."
but
suppose
your
adversary
should've
taken
--
should
have
taken
the
position
that
there
was
no
coercion
at
all
that
the
facts
are
closer
to
what
you
and
i
just
discussed
to
which
we
can
--
i
think
you
conceded
would
not
be
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
that
he
has
--
that
there's
--
there
has
not
been
any
bona
fide
contest
on
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
definition
of
facts
as
an
illusory
problem,
isn't
it?
it
seems
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
we
don't
dispute
the
facts,
but
what
we
do
dispute
is
the
ultimate
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
well
this
was
coercion.
justice
abe
fortas
i
dislike
taking
more
of
your
time
but
i
had
trouble
ascertaining
your
precise
position
from
your
brief
and
i
wanted
to
be
--
to
see
if
i'm
clear
about
it
now,
you're
taking
two
positions,
two
legal
positions.
justice
abe
fortas
one
is
that
the
instruction
was
incorrect,
that
reversible
error
was
committed
in
the
instruction
becau
--
in
that
instruction
where
the
court
said
you've
got
to
find
a
common
purpose,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
that
was
a
reversible
error.
and
then
second,
you're
saying
that
the
regardless
of
that,
the
court
below
committed
error
because
it
should
have
given
you
a
directed
verdict.
justice
abe
fortas
or
did
i
miss
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
did
i
miss
it
or
did
you
or
did
you
not
present
that
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
i
must
have
missed
it
(inaudible)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
have
it
pointed
out
then.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
put
it
very
briefly
and
i'm
trying
to
do
it,
you're
making
a
distinction
between
the
following.
number
one
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
you're
making
a
distinction
between
these
two
propositions.
number
one,
the
supplier
says
to
his
customer,
“if
you
don't
follow
the
suggested
retail
prices
we
will
terminate
our
dealings
with
you.”
we
say
that's
lawful.
number
two,
the
supplier
says
to
the
retail
dealer
either
directly
or
by
unmistakable
action
that
we're
--
we
want
you
to
continue
handling
our
goods,
we
don't
object
to
that
but
unless
you
handle
that
goods
and
at
the
suggested
retail
prices,
we're
just
going
to
chip
away
at
you,
chop
away
at
you
and
exert
pressures
on
you.
which
you
say
is
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
correct.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
constitution
prohibits
a
united
states
district
court
in
a
treble-damage
case
from
directing
a
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
not
of
a
--
not
of
guilty,
this
is
a
civil
case.
justice
abe
fortas
there
have
been
other
treble-damage
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
why
must
he
choose
mr.
hocker?
justice
abe
fortas
why
must
he
choose?
you
said
that
he's
either
got
to
litigate
or
be
your
distributor,
he
can't
be
both,
he's
got
to
choose.
now,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hocker,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
theory
and
let's
move
it
over
to
another
commodity.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
general
motors
has
a
distributor
of
its
chevrolet
cars.
and
general
motors
has
a
suggested
retail
price
and
general
motors
says
that
and
let
--
to
this
distributor,
unless
you
abide
by
our
suggested
retail
--
resale
price,
we
are
going
to
take
away
your
franchise
and
give
it
to
somebody
else.
and
then
general
motors
does
that,
he
says
“i
will
not
agree
to
comply.
so
general
motors
says,
“we'll
take
it
away.”
general
motors
then
goes
ahead
and
takes
away
his
franchise
and
gives
it
to
someone
else.
is
that
--
is
in
your
opinion,
is
that
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws
and
second
in
your
opinion,
is
that
like
this
case
as
you
see
it?
justice

your

my
