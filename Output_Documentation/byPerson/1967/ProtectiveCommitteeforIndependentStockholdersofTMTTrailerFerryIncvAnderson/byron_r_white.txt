justice
byron
r.
white
on
behalf
of
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
result
if
there
was
recovery
the
recovery
would
go
into
the
assets
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
prophylactic
rule
is
urging
that
the
trustee
is
not
going
to
be
trustee
of
the
company
and
that's
been
set
aside
plan
that
[inaudible]
president
of
the
company
but
it's
otherwise
make
the
plan
exactly
as
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do
but
it's
the
only
that's
wrong
with
the
plan,
is
that
the
trustee
is
the
president
of
the
company,
where
you
can
get
a
new
president
of
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
that's
the
answer
to
this,
that's
just
credit
isn't
it,
but
there
are
other
things
wrong
with
this
plan
that
must
be
cured.
you
say
that
trustee
would
not
only
become
president
of
the
company
but
in
the
process
of
compromising
certain
claims
that
there
wasn't
enough
done
to
later
comprise
on
and
that
the
court
had
also
in
approving
the
compromise.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
--
did
you
ever
object
to,
did
you
client
ever
object
to
trustee
being
president
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
proceedings
available
in
reorganization
[inaudible]
trustee
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
trust,
nobody
trust
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
on
the
claims,
why
do
you
need
to
go
beyond
just
saying
that
there
is
no,
not
sufficient
places
in
the
record
for
these
compromises?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
need
to
get
these
other
charges
of
alliances
and
fraud,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
all
the
record
showed
that
the
trustee
walks
in
the
court
that
here
are
some
claims
which
have
been
objected
to,
but
i
recommend
they
be
compromised
at
x
dollars
and
the
court
said
fine,
x
dollars.
your
position
is
that
just
about
all
that
happened
and
it's
insufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
certain
organizations,
the
sec
is
obligated
to
the
write
a
report
on
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
say
you
don't
recall
any
cases
since
the
early
1940s
in
which
you
have
not
objected
to
the
trustee
becoming
president
of
a
company
of
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
let's
assume
to
the
moment
that
the
court
agreed
that
you
want
the
contesting
president
[inaudible]
and
agreed
with
the
plan
i
believe
outside
of
the
conformation
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
to
your
argument
just
a
while
ago
[inaudible]
trying
to
that
there
would
be
settlement
and
maybe
something
wrong
with
the
settlement
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
without
you're
so
called
prophylactic
rule
wouldn't
just
be
cured
or
satisfied
by
appointing
a
new
president.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
argue
i
suppose
that
the
court
doesn't
go
along
with
you
know,
this
trustee's
president
if
the
reorganization
was
never
--
the
confirmation
was
nevertheless
be
set
aside
under
the
ground,
several
other
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
have
to
go
back
have
the
166
[inaudible]
because
that's
the
place
after
that
he
was
first
supposed
to
be
president.
i
would
think
that
its
into
your,
since
that's
the
critical
part
of
the
reorganization,
because
you
have
to
have
it
done
by
someone
you
felt
was
the
president.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
had
been,
the
first
reorganization
plan
had
him
as
president.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that
was
knocked
over
and
he
made
an
investigation
under
157.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
this
would
be
the
very
time
where
you
would
say
obviously
you
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
if
the
court
says
these
compromises
are
in
fact
they
are
vulnerable
because
nothing
appears
in
the
record,
they
maybe
absolutely
not
a
compromise
but
there
isn't
enough
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
percentage
of
their
claims
were
the
unsecured
creditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
preferred
claims
just
about
to
took
the
all
the
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
percentage
of
the
unsecured
creditors
claim
was
actually
recognized
in
a
way
of
stock,
i
suppose
they
got
stock
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
preferred
claims
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
merrill
claim,
a
maritime
name
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise
merrill's
claim
was
just
an
unsecured
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
mortgage
claims
that
are
that
were
also
settled
they
were
paid
in
cash?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
are
--
unless
they
have
a
claim
that
the
company
could
not
recognized?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
claims
against
outsider
with
the
trustees
just
existed
at
one
point,
did
those
claims
against
outside
[inaudible]
compromises
that
were
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
certainly
increase
the
assets
of
the
company,
if
those
claims
were
good
and
they
were
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
claim
to
extent
the
claim
to
extent
that
the
claim
is
made
here
that
trustee
did
not
pursuit
claims
that
should
have
been
pursued,
if
the
trustee
should
have
pursued
then
he
would
have
collected
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
have
some
more
assets
to
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
claims
you
say
wash
out
with
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
what
do
you
think
normally
happens
within
a
--
when
an
objection
is
filed
to
the
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
some
creditor
votes
against
the
plan
and
has
also
filed
an
objection
to
somebody
else's
claim.
do
you
think
that
the
vote
of
the
two
thirds
of
the
class
keeps
him
from
having
a
hearing
on
the
objection
of
that
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
this
case
then?
how
come
the
stockholders
didn't
get
a
hearing
on
their
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
reason
you've
got
this
is
--
is
the
only
answer
that
they
had
no
interest
in
the
reorganized
--
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
did
had
an
interest,
would
you
say
they've
would've
--
a
hearing
on
the
objections
would've
been
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happened
to
the
abrams
in
that
suits?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
by
the
trustee.
i've
got
the
answer
to
my
question.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
think
that
that's
true
but
do
you
have
the
$250,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
keep
it,
you're
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
like
to
know
that
nobody
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
have
plenty
of
opportunity
at
various
stages
in
this
proceeding
to
present
whatever
fact
to
the
court
you
wanted
to,
that
you
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
this
particular
settlement
of
the
caplan,
the
mortgage
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
the
trustee
on
the
stand
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ask
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
did
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
you
pursue
it
or
did
you
find
out
all
you
wanted
to
know?
he
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
refuse
to
say
--
tell
you,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
still
had
an
opportunity
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
question
him,
find
out
all
you
wanted
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
pursue
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
objected
the
approval
of
the
--
to
the
approval
to
compromise
on
the
basis
that
--
on
the
basis
stated
by
the
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
as
ultimately
objected
to
the
compromise?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
memorandum
that
you
joined
in
further
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
ever
ask
the
judge
to
set
the
matter
down
for
a
further
hearing?
what
--
in
that
memorandum
the
sec
filed
within
--
which
you
joined.
you
objected
to
the
compromise
and
there
hadn't
been
inadequate
here
--
basis
for
--
that
you
asked
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
further
--
for
a
further
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
behalf
of
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
result
if
there
was
recovery
the
recovery
would
go

i
know
you
do
but
it's
the
only
that's
wrong
with
the
plan,
is
that
the
trustee
is
the
president
of
the
company,
where
you
can
get
a
new
president
of
the
company.
justice

exactly
that's
the

to
this,
that's

there

what

[inaudible]

[inaudible]
justice

was
the

they

unless

did
the

did
those

that

increase

the

to

here
that

if

there
would
have

and
those

you

wash
out

keeps
him
from

how
about

then?
how

the

didn't
get

the

reason
you've

you
