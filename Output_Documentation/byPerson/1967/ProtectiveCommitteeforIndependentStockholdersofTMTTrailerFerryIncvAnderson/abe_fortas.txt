justice
abe
fortas
mr.
langbein,
how
is
the
state
point
which
you
are
asking
this
court
to
decide?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
see
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
that
proposition
of
law.
the
question
is
how
to
try
in
this
case?
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
that
proposition
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
also
relied
on
the
fact
on
[inaudible]
mentioning
with
that
trustee
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
that
trustee
became
the
president
on
the
of
the
reorganized
company?
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
we
are
asked
to
look
at
the
record
here
and
determine
that
the
trustee
was
derelict
in
his
fiduciary
duty
in
the
respect
which
you
have
been
discussing
and
on
that
basis
to
confirm
that
the
reorganization
plans
should
be
set
aside?
justice
abe
fortas
kind
of
a
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
take
the
position
having
objected
and
the
trustee
having
nevertheless
appointment
president
of
the
new
company,
did
you
take
position
of
that
invalidates
the
plan?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that's
place
that
you
have
failed
to
expose
your
[inaudible]
you
assert
that
position,
but
suppose
your
position
were
disallowed,
did
you
thereafter
take
the
position
that
invalidated
the
plan
and
made
any
distinction
between
the
time
and
the
occasion
of
which
you
make
your
objection
and
the
consequences
of
the
disallowance
of
your
objection.
because
here
you
are
saying
not
merely
that
it
was
wrong
for
the
court
below
to
approve
the
plan,
to
approve
that
feature
of
the
plan,
the
trustee
as
a
president,
but
you
are
saying
that,
that
such
approval
invalidate
the
plan
in
this
ground
for
setting
aside?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
fell
from
grace
only
after
the
all
the
other
terms
of
the
plan
had
been
approved,
suppose
this
paragon
and
all
these
trustees
are
supposed
to
be
paragons
of
virtue
and
suppose
this
paragon
continue
to
be
a
paragon
that
everything
else
was
decided
and
then
he
was
invited
to
neighborhood
salon
by
the
dominant
merging
interest
in
the
company
and
they
discuss
the
matter
quietly
and
they
reluctantly
agree
that
he
would
become
president
of
the
company.
does
that
make
any
difference
in
the
absoluteness
of
the
sec's
view?
justice
abe
fortas
were
these
compromises,
does
a
record
show
that
these
compromises
were
made
after
the
trustee
was
approached
with
respect
of
becoming
president
of
the
company?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
lots
of
temptations
to
which
even
an
independent
trustee
[inaudible]
for
example
on
the
questions
of
abuse,
trustees
would
know
for
example
that
this
case
in
these
two
companies
to
which
you
refer,
would
have
a
lot
to
say
about
whether
he
gets
a
$100,000
or
$500,000
as
fees?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
saying
maybe
perfectly
valid
moral
point
that
is
to
say
that
because
of
the
difficulty
of
knowing
just
when
trustee
agreed
to
become
a
president
or
when
came
the
idea
and
also
because
there
is
a
prospect
that
he
might
become
president
of
the
company,
he
might
make
unduly
favorable
settlements
if
the
people
who
were
merged
with
control,
it
maybe
correct
or
moral
idea,
but
when
you
say
that
should
be
a
principle
of
law
assisted
on
by
this
court
rather
than
something
that
congress
to
legislate
here
i
suppose
is
a
very
serious
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
you
got
to
do
some
fairly
rough
at
least
arbitrary
things
with
respect
to
time.
now
when
the
man
that's
presumably
when
this
man
was
appointed
as
trustee
was
independent
then
he
later
fell
from
grace?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
sec
take
a
position
on
the
merrill
--
whatever
it
is,
claim?
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
say
--
did
the
sec
alleged
that
it
was
fraudulent
that
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
the
court
ever
go
into
that?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
sec
object
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
sec
object
to
the
compromise?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
do
you
consider
the
sec's
role
under
the
statute
to
be
in
the
reorganization
of
this
magnitude?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
want
to
be
a
little
more
helpful
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
that
makes
--
see
if
i
can
clarify
this
in
my
on
line,
did
there
come
a
point
of
time
at
which
the
court,
the
judge
not
the
trustee,
the
court,
gave
to
the
stockholders
committee
and
the
sec
an
opportunity
to
present
on
the
record
evidence
that
it
had
with
respect
to
claims
that
might
be
asserted
against
these
--
to
a
creditor
party.
justice
abe
fortas
to
what
conclusion
does
all
that
leads
you
in
terms
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
what
conclusion
does
that
leads
you
in
terms
of
what
this
court
intended?
i
should
suppose
for
example,
your
position
is
that
--
your
claim
was
thoroughly
considered
before
the
court
and
everybody
had
an
opportunity
in
exhausting
this
opportunity
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
before
the
court.
supposed
that
we're
not
true
with
respect
to
the
merrill-stevens'
claim.
if
that
were
not
true
and
suppose
that
this
court
should
conclude,
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
will
(inaudible),
that
the
absence
of
those
hearings
as
surprisingly
hears
with
respect
with
the
merrill-stevens'
claim
is
a
violation
or
the
correct
rule
of
procedure,
then
don't
we
have
to
set
the
whole
plan
aside?
justice
abe
fortas
how
could
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
what
i'm
asking
is
--
i
appreciate
your
argument
and
of
course
the
clarity
of
it,
whatever
i
asked
you
is,
how
can
we
do
it?
what
do
you
--
asking
us
to
do?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
don't
know
how
we
could
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
we're
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
--
your
verifying
that
statement
here
ended
in
a
specific
conclusion
of
whether
it
was
an
admonition,
has
to
do
the
right
thing.
