you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

how
much

out
of
the
earnings?
chief

what
was
the
rest
of
it?
who
said
--
chief

earl
warren
in
the
10
years.
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ten
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
ask
this
mr.
simmons
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
these
alleged
conflicts
of
interest
raised
in
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
district
court
make
specific
findings
as
to
his
lack
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
evidenced
--
evidence
was
introduced
as
to
that
conflict
of
interest
alleged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
result
--
what
did
they
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
have
any
hearing
on
the
subject
as
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
relative
merits
of
these
reports
that
were
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
evidence
taken
on
--
before
the
court
in
any
proceeding
on
these
reports?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
request
made
by
either
side
to
have
it
--
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
--
did
they
ask
for
a
hearing
before
the
courts
on
the
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
would
that
make
if
the
compromise
was
in
fact
fraudulent?
why
shouldn't
they
be
in
here
of
some
kind
to
determine
the
liability
of
claim?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
you
would've
decided
that
representing
the
trustee,
but
as
with
the
court
any
interest
in
that
whether
it's
fraud
or
whether
it's
tort,
that
reduces
--
well
let's
say,
reduces
a
claim
of
a
million
and
a
half
down
to
a
half
a
million.
wouldn't
the
court
have
an
interest
in
determining
that
fact
when
there
are
reports
by
the
stockholders
and
by
the
sec
to
the
effect
that
that
is
a
fact?
i
would
think
that
in
the
interest
of
preserving
the
assets
of
the
company
for
anybody
who
might
be
entitled
to
it
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in
determining
that
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
simmons
i
can
see
how
you
could
--
on
your
investigation
becomes
satisfied
of
that
but
how
could
the
court
be
satisfied
of
that
if
it
didn't
have
a
hearing
on
that
conclusion
on
your
part
as
compared
with
the
reports
of
the
sec
and
the
stockholders
to
the
contrary?
