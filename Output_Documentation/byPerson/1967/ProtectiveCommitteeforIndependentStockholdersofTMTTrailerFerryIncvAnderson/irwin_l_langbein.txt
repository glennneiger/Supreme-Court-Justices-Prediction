mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
corporate
reorganization
case
arising
under
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
comes
here
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
originated
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
where
the
company
under
reorganization
has
its
home
port
and
principal
office.
it's
in
the
business
of
supplying
ocean
shipping
service
of
a
specialized
nature.
it
falls
well
or
highway
rather
trailers
overseas,
the
maritime
equivalent
of
railroad
fleet.
the
petitioner
protective
committee
consists
of
a
small
group
of
small
stockholders
who
hold
authorizations
from
like
stockholders,
but
they
have
attempted
throughout
10
years
in
three
reorganization
plans
involved
here
to
discharge
their
responsibility
to
the
whole
group
of
public
stockholders
and
not
insofar
as
the
record
shows
to
over
7000
stockholders
who
hold
over
one
million
eight
hundred
thousand
shares
of
stock
which
was
sold
to
them
in
an
original
flotation
or
a
series
of
flotations
of
stock
of
this
company
at
prices
up
to
$4.5
and
$5
a
share
in
a
rig
market
for
the
most
part
in
violation
of
the
1933
securities
act,
so
far
as
registration
is
concerned
and
also
in
violation
of
various
fraud
provisions
that
would
be
applicable
under
both
of
1933
and
1934
act.
the
protective
committee
seeks
to
set
aside
this
plan
of
reorganization,
the
third
as
i
said
which
excluded
the
stockholders
from
participation
in
the
reorganized
company.
they
say
that
this
reorganization
is
a
rehearsal
of
the
classic
pattern
of
the
reorganization
scandals
of
generation
ago
that
resulted
in
chapter
10.
scattered
innocent
security
holders
are
excluded
from
the
reorganization
which
has
been
dominated
we
say
by
the
people
who
wreck
the
old
company
and
notwithstanding
charges
of
mismanagement
and
fraud
against
them,
they
come
out
either
with
priorities
or
with
control
of
the
company.
we
served
as
brown's
proportion
not
a
long
trail
court
errors
of
law
particularly
in
the
area
of
valuation
law
and
securities
law
but
that
there
is
a
pervading
failure
on
the
part
of
both
courts
below
to
hold
the
trustee
who
in
chapter
10
is
the
key
to
a
fair
and
honest
reorganization
to
the
performance
of
the
statutory
duties.
we
say
that
he
performed
belated
and
inadequate
investigations
particularly
of
charges
of
fraud
against
the
people
who
ran
the
company
and
come
out
on
top.
we
say
that
he
made
some
errors
of
securities
law
which
mr.
ferber
for
the
sec
proposed
to
discuss
a
little
bit
later,
but
we
say
that
basically
what
was
wrong
was
that
both
courts
refused
to
hold
the
trustee
to
his
duties
of
investigation,
particularly
of
frauds
of
disclosure,
particularly
of
compromises
with
people
charged
with
fraud
and
in
one
instance
established
so
far
as
the
trustee
himself
is
concerned
by
an
investigation
which
he
had
made,
which
came
up
for
the
demonstration
of
fraud
to
his
satisfaction
on
the
basis
of
which
he
recommended
for
example
that
under
the
taylor
triborough
doctrine
those
people
should
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
reorganization,
but
they
came
out
on
top.
and
we
say
that
he
failed
to
disclose
the
basis
of
his
comprises
with
and
after
they
had
been
charged
with
fraud
which
had
never
been
recorded.
he
failed
to
bring
into
the
record
various
facts
which
are
of
importance
on
valuation.
he
fudged
we
say,
some
of
the
valuation
facts
which
were
in
the
record
and
most
important
of
all
he
failed
in
his
basic
duty
for
which
the
statute
imposed
upon
him
of
independence.
he
had
a
fiduciary
duty
under
the
statute
to
stay
it
on
the
length
with
all
the
people
in
the
reorganization
and
instead
he
entered
into
alliances
with
them.
for
example
the
largest
single
creditor
whose
case
i
shall
discuss
in
a
moment
turned
up
on
the
board
of
directors
with
him
and
he
himself
on
the
board
of
directors,
a
fact
which
the
sec
proposes
to
argue
as
having
special
significance.
and
we
say
that
he
had
a
duty
to
accept
no
favors
at
the
hands
of
the
people
with
whom
he
was
required
to
deal
and
with
whom
he
made
these
compromises.
we
say
he
violated
these
--
his
duty
by
accepting
his
position
as
president
of
the
new
company
at
the
hands
of
people
charged
with
fraud
and
also
at
the
hands
of
people
who
were
discount
claim
buyers
who
were
interested
in
patronage
and
they
too
sit
on
the
board
with
him
now.
sir,
this
is
the
third
time
that
the
case
has
been
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
our
complaints
here,
the
reason
that
we
presented
the
case
under
the
supervisory
power
rather
than
just
under
conflicts
is
that
we
felt
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
share
of
the
responsibility
for
happened
here
that
on
the
first
two
appeals,
on
the
first
one
we
raised
some
of
these
points
that
we
are
now
raising,
on
the
second
appeal
we
raised
all
of
them,
passed
them
off,
didn't
issue
advisory
guidance
on
these
points,
dismissed
them
as
moot
and
thereby
encouraged
the
court
below
to
encourage
the
trustee
it
his
dereliction
of
duty.
and
on
the
third
one
its
plain
from
the
opinion
and
the
court
said
this
case
has
been
here
nine
years,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
we
might
just
well
let
it
go
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
pretty
well
bored
with
it
and
never
looked
into
it
and
this
is
why
we
brought
it
here
as
a
matter
of
the
supervisory
power.
in
the
first
appeal
it
was
our
position
and
it
was
dismissed
as
moot.
the
second
appeal
and
it
was
combined
with
another
appeal
in
which
the
main
question
of
setting
aside
the
first
plan
for
fraud
was
brought
up
on
certiorari.
the
second
appeal,
we
didn't
bring
certiorari
although
the
government
on
a
collateral
point
that
is
collateral
presentation
did.
the
third
time
around
we
brought
certiorari
because
only
then
was
it
then
squarely
presented.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no
sir.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
is
quite
true
that
certiorari
was
denied
but
it
was
not,
it
was
not
our
committee
who
asked
for
it.
in
the
first
case
mr.
shaffer
and
spitzer
who
filed
the
brief
here
filed
for
certiorari
denied,
in
the
second
case
the
custody
himself
on
a
collateral
question
to
the
government
priority
rate,
filed
for
certiorari
also
denied
and
the
third
time
we
brought
it
here.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
the
priority,
well
really
the
priority
of
non-tax
plan.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
now,
what
i
think
illustrates
what
happened
here
and
what
we
complain
now
first
is
the
treatment
of
the
claim
of
merrill-stevens
dry-dock
and
repair
company,
which
is
the
shipyard
that
had
the
largest
single
creditor
claim
in
the
case.
merrill-stevens
claimed
amount
of
about
$1,600,000.
most
of
it
was
for
conversation
work
on
the
company's
self
propelled
vessel
called
the
carib
queen.
what
immediately
provoked
the
reorganization
was
the
fact
that
the
carib
queen
on
her
maiden
voyage
to
france
had
a
boiler
blowup
and
this
crippled
the
queen
and
the
crippled
the
company
and
led
to
reorganization.
of
course
the
validity
of
that
claim
just
as
a
matter
of
a
commercial
claim
was
a
better
subject
of
dispute.
when
a
boiler
blows
up
and
a
vessel
is
put
out
of
commission,
so
that
the
company
has
to
limp
along
after
that
has
it
did
during
the
reorganization
with
barges
only,
there
is
a
lot
of
serious
problem
involved
and
this
was
at
first
disposed
off
by
the
trustee
notwithstanding
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
not
alone
the
queen
that
it
had
been
subject
to
shoddy
workmanship,
but
another
vessel
had
capsized
after
having
been
designed
by
merrill-stevens,
still
another
vessel
had
been
put
out
of
the
shipyard
with
some
defect
in
discharge
line,
which
of
course
at
the
swamp
and
sink
and
there
were
all
of
these
shall
we
say
commercial
defenses.
the
trustee
recommended
payment
in
full,
after
an
off
the
record
of
investigation.
the
security
and
exchange
commission
made
its
own
investigation,
purely
on
the
question
of
what
i
might
call
a
commercial
claim.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
defenses.
they
weren't
perfect,
but
they
should
either
be
litigated
out
for
if
an
appropriate
settlement
whose
dimension
that
commission
wasn't
prepared
the
state
within
the
week
it
should
be
settled
out.
we
the
committee
were
dissatisfied
with
that,
just
as
we
had
been
dissatisfied
with
some
earlier
refusals
of
the
trustee
to
investigate.
we
obtained
leave
from
the
court
to
investigate
and
we
made
a
further
investigation,
as
a
result
of
which
we
turned
out
charges
and
we
outlined
the
evidence
of
fraud
by
merrill-stevens,
its
largest
creditor.
the
essence
of
the
fraud,
the
details
i
have
to
skim
over
consisted
of
participation
in
a
fraud
by
other
people
in
the
case.
the
other
people
in
the
case
are
a
group
headed
by
a
man
named
abrams,
a
notorious
stock
swindler
who
was
in
federal
prison
at
the
time
of
this
reorganization,
although
not
convicted
of
any
matters
involved
in
this
company,
a
representative
of
a
respectable
security
house,
a
man
named
shaffer.
the
trustee
in
a
belated
investigation
that
wasted
three
years
of
this
reorganization,
the
one
that
resulted
in
the
first
certiorari
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about,
had
found
that
abrams
and
shaffer
had
wrecked
this
company,
that
there
had
been
in
the
pre-reorganization
stage
a
large
number
of
sales
of
securities,
most
of
them
in
violation
of
the
securities
act
and
fraudulent
by
virtue
of
the
techniques
that
i
have
mentioned.
and
furthermore
he
had
found
notwithstanding
denials
by
m/s.
shaffer
and
spitzer
and
some
of
the
people
associated
with
them,
that
shaffer
and
spitzer
who
came
into
reorganization
posing
as
innocent
mortgagee
title
holders,
actually
knew
that
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
mortgage
that
they
have
and
which
wound
up
with
the
priority
were
to
a
large
extent
owned
by
shaffer
and
by
abrams,
directors
of
the
records
of
the
company
but
this
was
hidden.
and
this
was
the
crime
--
this
was
the
matter
that
it
had
led
to
this
first
plan.
the
trustee
refused
to
accept
leads
that
we
had
offered
him
showing
the
connection
and
it
wasn't
until
three
years
later
as
a
result
of
an
independent
investigation
by
the
sec
followed
by
a
thorough
so
far
as
it
went
investigation
on
167,
the
statute
section
that
provides
for
formal
investigation,
full
investigation
that
these
things
were
discovered
and
at
that
time
the
trustee
recommended
that
shaffer's
spitzer
should
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
heap,
that
there
should
be
suits
pressed
against
them
against
the
individuals
behind
them
that
there
should
be.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
on
behalf
of
the
company
and
also
the
point
or
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
faber
proposed
to
discuss
that
the
individual
stockholders
who
had
been
defrauded
by
the
company
had
a
position
to
creditors
just
as
if
they
have
been
run
down
by
a
company
truck
or
had
failed
to
receive
goods.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
he
said
the
company
had
claims
on
the
individual--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sure,
he
recommended
the
assertion
of
both
sets
of
claims,
the
company
claim
against
these
people,
the
stockholder
claim
against
these
people
and
also
he
recommended
that
there
should
be
an
offset
against
this
innocent
appearing
mortgage
which
was
on
the
most
crucial
assets
that
the
company
had
and
which
had
been
put
by
these
people
who
wrecked
the
company.
on
these
assets,
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
for
the
option
to
turn
them
all,
again
the
stock
that
everything
went
well
and
with
the
stranglehold
in
case
everything
worked
out
to
nothing
as
look
to
be
the
case
at
that
time.
now,
essentially
what
i
have
said
a
the
shaffer
spitzer
group
and
it's
first
reorganization
plan
was
a
digression
because
my
interest
in
it
is
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
were
charges
of
fraud
against
this
group.
and
that
they
had
been
established
by
the
trustee
on
the
record
in
the
result
of
an
investigation
although
belatedly.
and
we
have
said
also
in
this
further
investigation
that
we
had
made
that
the
merrill-stevens
group
allied
themselves
with
this,
stop
pushing
in
this
fraud
because
they
too
had
connive
with
management
and
with
the
people
who
are
dominating
management
and
it's
financial
matters
to
commit
a
fraud
upon
the
maritime
administration
and
upon
the
public.
again
without
going
into
the
detail
of
it
because
it
has
never
been
investigated
in
fact
there
happens
not
to
be
a
formal
denial
of
it
on
the
record.
a
portion
of
the
stock
portion
was
achieved
in
this
case
by
representation
as
to
a
maritime
commission
guarantee
on
the
construction
mortgage
of
the
carib
queen
in
her
reconversion
of
the
company's
use.
the
mortgage
had
been
guaranteed
by
the
maritime
commission,
which
made
a
statutory
finding
which
was
much
advertised
by
the
stock
pushers
that
the
enterprise
was
economically
sound
and
that
guarantee
could
not
have
issued
nor
that
representation
had
been
made
use
of
in
the
sales
or
not
for
fraud
practices
upon
the
maritime
administration
by
a
mortgaging
out
procedure.
the
statue
under
which
the
maritime
administration
operates
initially
in
these
loan
guarantees
requires
that
a
certain
fraction
of
the
cost
to
be
paid
in
cash,
it
was
not.
although
it
was
paid
in
cash,
there
was
a
hidden
under-the-table
deal
whereby
the
cash
would
return
right
back
to
the
company
in
exchange
for
company
stock
at
an
arbitrary
price.
the
company
was
at
the
time
putting
stock
down
on
the
markets
who,
the
hands
of
its
friends
and
people
who
controlled
it
for
all
sorts
of
prices
and
for
nothing.
so
this
was
way
in
which
we
said
that
there
had
been
a
fraud
on
the
part
of
this
major
creditor.
now
with
respect
to
both
these
creditors
the
mortgagee
group
and
the
trustee
had
found
guilty
of
fraud
and
the
shipyard
when
we
had
alleged
in
detail
although
there
had
been
no
formal
investigation
was
guilty
of
fraud
nothing
happened
so
far
as
the
trustee
was
concerned
by
way
of
action
on
that
fraud.
indeed
at
one
point
in
support
of
our
charges
of
fraud
against
merrill-stevens
we
attempted
to
bring
into
the
record
by
ordinary
discovery
procedures,
motion
to
produce
and
so
on
some
documents
bearing
on
it
which
we
described
after
we
located
them
that
the
trustee
said
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
he
hadn't
found
them
and
the
trustee
opposed
our
attempt
to
obtain
them
by
ordinary
discovery
procedures.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
would
like
the
court
to
rule
as
follows.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
first
that
a
reorganization
conducted
by
a
trustee
in
disregard
of
his
responsibilities
to
investigate
and
his
responsibilities
to
disclose
results
in
a
reorganization
plan
which
has
to
be
set
aside
because
the
trustee's
functions
under
the
statute
are
too
important
to
trifle
with.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
think
there
is
some
bickering
about
it
in
the
briefs.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
regard
it
as
myself
substantially
settled
because
i
can
find
the
counsel
has
not
been
able
to
cite
any
cases
to
the
contrary.
next
we
would
like
to
have
the
court
rule
on
the
disqualifications
of
the
trustee
through
making
alliances
with
people
whom
he
ought
to
kept
at
arm's
length
and
because
section
221(5)
of
the
act
requires
that
as
a
precondition
of
confirming
a
plan
that
the
court
must
take
a
look
back
over
what's
happened
in
the
reorganization
and
satisfy
itself
of
the
independence
of
the
trustee
that
the
plan
is
bad
if
the
trustee
isn't
independent.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yeah.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
and
the
sec
was
running
this
on
the
ground
of
prophylactic
rule
that
no
matter
of
what
the
facts
the
trustee
has
no
business
being
president
of
the
company,
the
way
there
has
been
a
disputed
reorganization
plan,
we
say
that
while
we
agree
with
that
position
perhaps
because
we
are
closer
to
the
facts.
we
don't
have
this
magisterial
view
that
the
sec
has
that
on
the
particular
facts
the
trustee
disqualified
himself
because
he
made
alliances
with
the
people
that
he
was
supposed
to
create
fiduciary
in
fashion
and
not
make
alliances
with
them,
not
get
any
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
one
contention
was
ruled
on
against
us
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
what
i
call
a
prophylactic
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
left
open
the
question
of
whether
a
lack
of
independence
in
fact
was
available
to
us.
it
said
that
if
we
prove
that
it
was
in
--
that
he
didn't
have
independence
in
fact
that
at
that
point
we
would
have
a
bad
point.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
well,
there
are
other
grounds
that
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
mr.
justice.
we
are
asking
you
to
look
at
the
record.
we
have
summarized
the
record
and
while
there
is
dispute
i
think
on
some
of
the
fringes
of
the
fact,
there
is
no
dispute
i
think
as
to
the
main
fact
here,
although
i
was
somewhat
surprised
by,
in
the
reply
briefs
and
kind
of
a
general
denial
and
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
it's
vigorously
general
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir,
i
think
so,
but
there
are
lot
of
things
that
need
diagnose
here
and
-–
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
think
so.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
there
are
multiple
grounds
upon
which
we
advance
this
case.
one
ground
i
haven't
even
mentioned
except
as
a
rubric
the
fact
the
district
court
announced
and
allowed
the
application
of
what
we
consider
to
be
a
rule
of
valuation
law
that
is
utterly
contrary
to
every
case
that
this
court
has
had
on
the
subject.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
if
you
can
disclose
it
short
by
the
prophylactic
rule
and
if
it
follows
from
that
as
we
say
that
the
plan
itself
is
bad
if
the
trustee
is
independent
then
the
plan
goes
back,
but
what
i
am
afraid
of,
very
much
afraid
of
in
view
of
the
history
of
what
happens
when
there
is
no
affiliate
guidance
in
this
case
that
we
are
in
for
more
of
the
same.
we've
had
10
years
of
this
litigation.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no
your
honor
we
insist
that
the
trustees'
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
now
we
say
that
there
are
other
things
wrong
with
the
plan.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right,
sir.
so
that
i
think
if
you
would
nearly
disposed
off
the
thing
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
trustee
shouldn't
become
president,
that
wouldn't
answer
case.
it's
our
view
that
what
the
trustee
did
on
the
way
to
becoming
president
compromised
the
whole
record,
made
it
impossible
for
one
to
make
a
fair
determination
as
for
example
the
facts
that
he
put
into
the
record
on
valuation.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh!
yes
we
did
sir.
not
on
the
first
plan,
although
he
was
president
in
the
first
plan
too,
but
in
the
second
plan
and
in
the
third
plan
we
objected
and
in
the
proceedings
below
we
objected.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
it
happens
that
that
there
are
no
precedents
on
the
subject
and
i
need
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
am
certain
that
there
are
procedures
available
although
the
statute
doesn't
spell
them
out
–
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
it
would
be
too
outrageous
if
one
didn't
have
that,
but
we
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
remove
the
trustee
by
an
independent
procedure.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
there
is
a
claim
remedy
available
for
an
non-independent
trustee
knock
out
the
plan
and
as
a
core
committee
we
even
had
to
have
the
court
under
the
old
rules
weigh
depending
on
the
record,
we
couldn't
afford
to
go
up
on
every
side
skirmish.
most
of
the
trustee's
lack
of
independence
was
built
up
during
the
proceedings
that
lasted
very
few
months
in
the
formulation
of
the
second
plan.
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
began
to
realize
that
the
trustee
was
withholding
evidence
from
the
record,
that
the
trustee
was
making
alliances
with
people
with
whom
we
thought
he
shouldn't
make
alliances
that
he
was
granting
sweetheart
contracts
for
example
to
one
of
these
claim
buyer
that
cost
the
company
a
$100,000
a
year
over
the
nearest
competitive
bid
that
he
was
running
off
people
majors
in
the
industry
i
am
talking
about
the
towing
contract,
majors
in
the
industry
whom
we
brought
in
and
whom
he
refused
to
allow
to
have
information
that
he
was
running
off
bidders
whom
we
proposed
to
bring
in
because
he
wouldn't
give
them
information
that
he
was
rejecting
a
cash
plan
which
was
offered
by
an
alternative
bidder
whom
we
didn't
bring
in
to
the
case.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir
they
are.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
to
the
extent
that
they
are
un-denied
we
–-
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
not
solely
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
un-denied
in
the
record.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
that
the
court
doesn't
go
into
such
as
resolving
disputes
of
fact
that
have
been
resolved
by
the
judge.
but
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
in
a
brief
says
that
where
we
say
we
charge
fraud
against
merrill-stevens
and
one
of
the
answering
brief
says
no,
they
never
charged
fraud
against
merrill-stevens,
that's
merely
cited
on
the
brief,
shouldn't
preclude
the
court
from
what
is
unpleasant
and
difficult
duty
most
of
which
probably
does
get
turned
over
to
the
courts,
going
to
the
record
and
finding
out
whether
what
we
say
is
so.
this
occurs
anytime
that
there
is
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
trial
court
justice.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
i
think
we
can
sir.
we
think
that
this
was
a
primary
duty
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
we
said
these
very
things
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
chapter
and
verse
citation
to
this
record
that
it
was
the
court
of
appeals'
duty
not
to
flip
this
off
as
it
did
saying
well
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
but
when
we
say
that
the
record
is
poisoned,
they
may
have
taken
a
look
at
the
record,
but
what
they
did
was
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
when
we
said
that
the
trustee
derelictions
of
duty
were
compounded
by
errors
of
law
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court,
for
example
in
enunciating
a
wrong
rule
of
evaluation
law
and
when
we
say
that
the
trustee
prevented
us
from
having
a
true
evaluation
of
the
proper
number
of
claims,
that
at
that
point
this
passes
beyond
the
boundary
of
discretion.
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
something,
the
court
has
the
evidence
before
and
it
ruled
as
it
--
as
it
had
the
right
to
rule
on
disputed
questions
of
fact.
this
not
discretion.
this
is
error
of
law
particularly
in
the
area
where
we
say
--
particularly
in
the
area
where
we
say
that
the
trustee
who
has
the
duty
of
making
up
a
record
for
the
court
distorted
the
record.
the
court
didn't
pass
on
those
issues
in
fact.
these
are
very
serious
charges.
they
go
the
essence
of
bankruptcy
as
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
is
one
ground
that
we
certainly
have
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
not
just
to
knock
out
those
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that's
right.
we
think
the
case
law
says
that
and
likewise
we
say
that
on
the
other
major
issues
here
valuation
and
wrong
standard.
valuation
--
wrong
standard,
that's
a
matter
of
law
and
when
the
trustee
acting
under
that
wrong
standard
doesn't
bring
into
the
record
or
the
court
keeps
out
of
the
record
evidence
for
example
of
the
present
trends
of
the
company,
where
he
allows
the
company
to
be
valued
on
the
basis
of
three
ships,
although
in
fact
there
are
four
now,
where
he
allows
the
company
to
valued
on
the
basis
of
barges
although
the
trustee
has
well
matured
plans.
he's
been
spending
company
money,
going
out
and
investigating
another
type
of
ship,
which
he
says
is
going
to
make
it
cheaper
to
run.
that
at
that
point
that
evidence
has
got
to
come
into
the
record
and
the
trial
judge
said,
no
it
can't
come
into
the
record.
i'm
not
interested
in
anything
expect
what's
happening
now.
this
is
a
type
of
thing
that
we
say
you
have
to
go
beyond
in
order
to
stop
this
from
happening
again.
that
this
[inaudible]
is
one
of
these
fields
and
reorganization
is
one
of
these
fields,
it
just
requires
supervision
every
now
and
then.
this
is
what
makes
bankruptcy
ring.
we
say
to
the
court
to
look
into
these
things
in
every
once
in
a
while
i
am
reminded
of
the
right
to
consultation
from
the
days
of
[inaudible]
julian
wayneright.
he
would
bring
them
up
here
and
we'd
come
up
with
charges
and
the
court
would
have
to
look
into
the
record
and
see
what
happened.
unpleasant
job,
unpleasant
to
all
of
you,
unpleasant
to
investigate.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
do
it,
we
are
committed
to
do
the
duty
of
this
court's
[inaudible]
and
the
jury
as
well.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
reply
only
very
briefly
to
mr.
spitzer's
discussion.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
going
to
reply
only
very
briefly,
sir
to
mr.
spitzer's
discussion.
because
most
of
it
is
what
i
characterized
yesterday
as
bickering
in
the
responding
brief
and
also
answered
by
more
bickering
i'm
afraid
in
our
reply
brief.
we
have
attempted
to
set
out
specific
citations
to
the
record
that
places
of
which
we
think
mr.
spitzer
is
in
error
in
his
view
of
what
was
actually
in
the
record.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
say,
sir
that
mr.
spitzer
cannot
come
here
and
talk
about
equities
when
all
compromises,
when
our
position
on
it,
mr.
justice
black,
is
not
on
the
merits
of
the
mortgage.
he
may
have
a
good
mortgage;
he
may
have
a
bad
mortgage.
our
position
on
it
from
the
first
was
that
he
was
not
or
his
clients
were
not
in
any
position
of
being
able
to
assert
their
commercial
rights
under
the
mortgage
because
they
were
in
fact
acting
as
cloaks
for
people
who
wrecked
this
company.
and
that
no
matter
what
the
commercial
situation
with
respect
to
the
mortgage,
the
trustee
at
first
brought
that
very
bitterly
that
they
cannot
estop
anybody
because
they
are
covers
for
frauds.this
was
a
position
that
we
wondered
about
to
begin
with.
very
early
in
the
proceedings,
mr.
spitzer
was
asked
in
open
court,
“is
there
is
mr.
joe
abrams
interested
in
or
who
is
a
part
of
that
group?”,referring
to
his
settings.
mr.
spitzer:
“there
is
no
joe
--
mr.
joe
abrams
in
our
group.
he
has
an
interest
in
i
believe
in
--
no
there
is
not.
no.”
so,
at
that
point,
there
was
a
disclaimer
of
any
interest
by
--
in
the
group
by
the
man
who
was
primarily
along
with
his
other
client,
mr.
shaffer,
so
the
trustee
found
in
his
ultimate
investigation
the
prime
record
of
this
company.
it
was
only
when
we
turned
up
evidence
which
we
tended
to
the
trustee
in
which
he
rejected
that
there
really
was
a
joe
abrams
behind
this
and
when
the
sec
turned
up
more
evidence
that
ultimately
the
trustee
was
forced
to
set
aside
his
first
plan
which
it
turned
the
whole
company
over
to
these
people.
now,
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
that
they
cannot
be
in
a
position
of
saying,
“we're
innocent
equity
people
here.
we
have
equities
with
us.
we
were
sucked
into
a
compromise.”
we
say
that
they
were
sucked
into
a
compromise,
the
terms
of
that
compromise
whenever
fully
disclosed.
the
basis
for
that
compromise
was
never
fully
disclosed
as
i
argued
yesterday.
what
right
therefore
do
they
have
to
sit
here
innocently
and
say,
“everybody
is
estopped?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
made
a
deal."
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
with
respect
to
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
didn't
know
what
the
detail
facts
of
the
settlement
were.
we
had
presented
all
the
facts
of
the
fraud.
we
had
presented
or
the
trustee
had
finally
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes,
we
did.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
there
was
a
passage
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
he
misleds.
there's
a
passage
in
the
record
in
which
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
let
me
just
read
what
happened
here,
sir.
he
was
asked
regarding
the
alleged
compromises
of
the
shaffer-spitzer
mortgage
claim
and
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
would
you
give
us
some
indication
as
to
the
basis
of
this
compromises.
now
this
was
after
the
facts
were
out,
that
there
was
a
fraud
here
permitted
by
their
shaffer-spitzer
principle.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
sorry,
sir.
“i'll
be
glad
to,”
he
says,
“i'll
be
glad
to”.
and
on
the
next
page,
he's
asked
again
about
shaffer-spitzer
and
he
says,
“the
compromise
of
a
claim,
the
caplan
claim,
was
worked
out
between
the
attorney
for
the
group,
my
attorney
and
myself
was
done
in
conference;
all
three
of
us
had
with
the
court,
completed
after
deliberations,
negotiations,
submitted
to
the
court,
approved
by
the
court.
that's
the
way
we
came
about
to
reach
that
compromise.
so
he
states
where
it
happened,
“in
chambers”
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
“who
was
there”
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
didn't
pursue
for
the
reason
that
the
court
at
that
very
point
was
telling
everybody,
“look,
i
have
a
jury
coming
in
here.
i
can't
sit
around
here
all
day
and
listen
to
wrangling
about
this.
you
can
submit
a
memorandum.”
and
the
sec
submitted
a
memorandum
in
which
it
raised
this
very
point
and
we
joined
in
the
memorandum.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
it
beforehand
and
we
were
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
further
objections.
we
objected
to
it
when
the
plan
first
came
out.
we
said
you
can
have
a
plan
with
these
compromises
in
them
uninvestigated,
with
the
basis
not
stated.
then
when
mr.
gonson,
sec
counsel,
made
this
direct
inquiry,
“what's
the
basis?”
i
read
the
answer.
and
on
--
we
said
the
same
thing
and
made
these
objections
again
not
alone
at
approval
time,
at
a
confirmation
time,
at
appeal
time
on
both
the
version
of
the
final
plan
that
was
--
what
we
call
the
second
plan
and
the
version
of
plan
that
we
call
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
all
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
all
of
these
points.
i
can't
tell
the
court
that
we
said
that
there
had
to
be
a
further
hearing
after
there
was
an
order
of
approval
came
out.
we'd
raise
the
same
points
again
and
again
and
again,
we'd
ask
the
hearings
on
them
again
and
again
and
again
particularly
with
respect
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim
and
we
had
insisted
throughout
this
proceeding.
one
further
point
should
be
mentioned
here.
we
are
a
committee.
we
are
intended
to
be
holding
a
watching
brief.
it
is
our
responsibility
to
the
people
whom
we
represent,
some
7000
stockholders,
who
have
paid
many
millions
of
dollars
under
this
fraudulent
scheme
to
float
stock,
how
much
of
it
reached
the
company
ultimately.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
we
know
from
the
extent
of
the
record
that
has
been
made,
a
good
deal
of
it,
many
hundreds
of
thousand
dollars
of
it
were
(inaudible).
our
position
here
is
to
point
out
what
needs
to
be
done,
to
suggest
what
needs
to
be
done,
to
try
and
do
it
if
it
isn't
done.
but
when
we
are
blocked,
at
that
point
it
becomes
the
court's
own
responsibility
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
take
an
affirmative
responsibility
for
the
fairness
of
a
plan
which
is
his
duty
under
chapter
x.
whether
we
object
before,
during
or
after
and
we
did.
we
think
we've
done
all
that
we
needed
to
do
as
the
court's
responsibility
and
the
trustee's
fiduciary
responsibility.
let
me
turn
more
directly
now,
if
i
may,
to
mr.
simmons'
position.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
something
he
said
at
the
very
start
of
his
discussion
which
he
said
it's
going
to
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
read
all
seven
volumes
of
this
record.
i'm
afraid
as
i
said
yesterday
that
it
was
going
to
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
read
a
little
more
of
this
record
than
i
would
like
to
have
read
just
because
of
these
matters
of
detail
of
the
fact.
but
none
of
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
ordinarily
refuses
to
read
by
way
of
looking
over
to
see
whether
or
not
a
district
judge
has
made
appropriate
findings
of
fact
on
an
issue
presented
to
him.
of
course
there
are
disputes
of
fact.
mr.
simmons
insists
that
there
never
wasn't
a
--
any
real
charges
of
fraud
by
us
against
merrill-stevens.
and
all
we
can
do
is
ask
the
court
to
read
our
specifications
in
which
we
say
that
they
joined
themselves
in
with
the
basic
shaffer-spitzer
we
call
it,
it
could
just
as
well
be
called
abrams
and
shaffer
because
they
are
the
ultimate
defrauders.
mr.
shaffer
and
mr.
spitzer
in
our
view
are
merely
gnawing
close
for
shaffer
himself
and
abrams
as
himself
on
it.
we
objected
to
the
claim
on
fraud
grounds
because
there
were
misrepresentation
as
to
this
carib
queen
as
to
her
speed,
her
performance,
whether
or
not
she'd
been
mortgaged
out.
all
these
matters
that
were
essential
to
the
fraud.
this,
the
court
will
have
to
read.
likewise,
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
just
see
whether
i'm
right
or
whether
mr.
spitzer
is
right
when
he
says
both
in
his
brief
and
here
that
the
group
behind
the
shaffer-spitzer
mortgage
was
“plainly
disclosed”.
the
briefs
themselves
operators
and
indexed
to
the
record.
but
the
most
important
thing
that
i'd
do
want
to
state
with
respect
to
this
question
of
how
much
you
have
to
read
is
really
an
answer
to
the
question
that
i
started
to
answer
yesterday
when
justice
fortas
asked
me
about
it.
but
what
do
we
want
here?
it's
our
position
that
nothing
that
we
want
is
going
to
require
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
determinations
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
even
where
we
asked
for
review
of
something
that
is
a
mix
batch
in
effect
in
law,
the
matter
of
insolvency
evaluation.
what
we're
objecting
to
there
is
the
adoption
and
the
enforcement
of
a
rule
of
law
by
the
district
court
which
we
say
is
in
--
just
counter
distinction
to
the
rules
of
law
that
this
court
had
always
enforced
and
said
in
the
area
of
evaluation.
that
it
is
necessarily
a
matter
of
future,
i
think
that
it
is
necessarily
a
matter
or
probability
and
that
all
evidence
which
now
exists
bearing
on
the
future
earnings
of
the
company
must
be
presented
to
the
court.
and
for
that
reason
we
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
discuss
even
on
this
one
question
which
might
be
of
question
of
fact,
any
of
the
detailed
underlying
facts
because
the
facts
are
really
admitted
in
here.
the
disputes
of
facts
are
fringed
disputes.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
undisputed
on
that,
that
you
cannot
value
we
think
a
company,
which
during
the
reorganization
has
grown
from
300
to
600
trailers
from
three
to
five
ships
as
this
court
--
the
district
court
insisted
it
be
valued.
as
it
is
now,
a
three-ship
company,
when
their
turning
away
business
all
the
time
and
find
new
ships
and
planning
improved
ships
and
spending
estate
money
on
those
plans
and
spending
a
estate
time
on
those
plans,
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
fact.
similarly,
on
the
question
whether
there
should
be
a
full
investigation,
it
is
a
matter
of
law
we
say.
four
courts
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
four
of
the
circuits
have
said
that
you've
got
to
have
a
full
investigation
on
the
record
instead
of
the
kind
of
investigation
that
was
had
here
off
the
record
with
the
trustee
even
turning
down
and
objecting
to
us
and
blocking
us
when
we
wanted
to
get
discovery
of
some
of
the
most
important
facts
here
that
we
had
found
in
third-party
hands.
similarly,
when
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
full
disclosure
of
the
basis
of
compromise,
it
is
a
fact
that
the
compromise
basis
was
not
stated
on
the
record
and
three
more
of
the
circuit
courts
which
we've
cited
in
the
briefs
have
said
this.
it's
our
view
that
it's
this
court's
function
and
responsibility
in
response
really
to
justice
fortas'
question
as
what
we
want
here,
to
make
it
clear
that
the
law
is
the
same
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
the
law
should
be
the
same
throughout
the
country
so
that
we
don't
have
the
danger
of
what
happens,
what
is
traditionally
happened.
what
caused
chapter
x,
people
without
any
supervision,
running
bankruptcies
to
suit
themselves,
friendly
trustees,
private
deals.
another
thing
that
we
think
the
court
must
enunciate
as
a
rule
of
law
here
is
that
the
trustee
must
put
under
an
affirmative
duty
to
bring
in
to
the
record
all
the
evidence
that
there's
on
valuation.
mr.
simmons,
i'm
sure
inadvertently
made
a
mistake
--
meant
there
when
he
said,
that
our
own
expert,
the
committee's
expert
valued
this
property
at
only
$4,500,000
as
a
going
concern
value.
there
is
a
passage
in
the
record.
i
could
quote
it
but
i
will
cite
it.
we've
also
cited
it
on
the
brief
at
pages
246
to
248
of
the
record
that
we
call
roman
ii
here
in
which
the
thrust
--
in
which
our
officer
says
--
our
--
i'm
sorry.
in
which
our
expert
says
that
the
officers
of
the
company,
the
trustee,
have
not
furnished
him
with
only
information
he
needs
to
determine
how
much
higher,
how
much
higher
than
$4,500,000
it
should
be.
our
expert
did
not
make
a
valuation
in
terms
of
--
this
is
the
figure,
he
said
that
this
is
the
minimum
figure
and
the
reason
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
a
higher
figure
is
because
the
trustee
can't
--
wouldn't
furnish
me
the
information
that's
necessary.
that's
in
the
record
and
i
have
discussed
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
and
placed
into
the
brief
a
number
of
other
passages
in
which
the
trustee
withheld
information
from
a
--
certainly
one
thing
must
be
done
here
by
way
of
remedy.
the
trustee
must
be
instructive.
any
trustee
must
be
instructed
that
it
is
his
duty
to
supply
all
the
information.
another
thing
that
we
need
that
doesn't
require
any
statement,
any
controversy
of
a
fact,
fewer
matter
of
law,
that
there
must
be
a
ruling
and
we
think
that
that
the
ruling
should
be
the
one
that
is
set
out
in
the
sec's
brief
that
defrauders'
stockholders
do
have
a
right
to
claim
as
creditors.
that
question
was
never
ventilated
below
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
erroneously
held
and
we
think
this
is
again
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
we
were
barred
from
raising
the
question
because
of
laches.
we
say
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
of
laches,
that
we
were
too
late
in
filing
our
claim.
we
say
on
that
point
that
laches
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court,
and
we've
cited
the
(inaudible)
case
in
our
brief
that
laches
is
a
question
of
fact
and
that
the
district
judge
has
no
authority
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
make
a
finding
that
we
were
in
laches
until
there'd
been
a
hearing
on
that
question
determining
what
would
the
excuses
for
our
delay,
what
were
the
consequences,
who
was
hurt
by
our
delay
as
well
as
did
we
in
fact
delay.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
bickering
over
facts.
this
is
a
matter
of
acting
on
agreed
facts,
facts
which
are
indisputable
in
the
record.
there
must
also
be,
we
say,
by
way
of
remedy
here,
a
real
review
under
section
221
(5)
which
requires
the
judge
to
look
over
the
whole
cause
of
the
proceedings
and
determine
before
he
approves
the
plan,
before
he
confirms
it
rather,
that
there
has
been
an
independent
trustee.
this
is
not
a
fact
question.
we
think
we
have
developed
the
facts
which
demonstrate
that
this
trustee
had
been
acting
under
conflict
of
interest.
the
question
is
not
whether
he
was
corrupt
but
as
this
court
had
said
whether
he
had
the
opportunity
for
corruption
and
whether
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
position
where
it
can't
be
told,
it
can't
be
determined
what
he
has
done.
it
--
none
of
this
is
a
question
of
fact.
the
trustee,
we
say,
must
go.
it
is
not
important
really
whether
the
trustee
has
the
job
as
president
of
this
company.
what
is
important
is
that
whether
by
a
director's
instruction
in
the
mandate,
unmistakable
language
in
the
opinion,
it
must
be
made
plain
that
the
plan
must
be
vacated
and
that
any
other
plan
by
a
man
who
has
acted
in
conflict
of
interest
will
also
be
vacated.
this
is
a
conclusion
that
we
reached
in
our
brief
when
we
asked
for
relief.
the
sec
which
has
supported
us
throughout
in
this
proceeding
long
before
the
particular
questions
that
mr.
ferber
argued
yesterday
were
raised.
the
sec
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
and
the
conclusion
of
its
--
stated
in
somewhat
differentlanguage.
it
is
our
view
that
all
of
these
things
are
things
that
the
court
can
do,
the
court
can
order
done
in
a
mandate
or
indicate
must
be
done
in
an
opinion.
that's
what's
necessary
to
claim
this
reorganization
now.
i
would
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
some
of
mr.
simmons'
particular
contentions
that
there
was
little
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
there
was
a
dispute
as
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
the
sec
objected
to
its
allowance.
at
roman
ii
1094
of
the
record
that
the
sec
asked
for
a
hearing
on
our
particular
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
it
said
that
after
those
new
specifications
at
large
charging
fraud
were
in
the
record
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
on
it.
finally,
on
this
detailed
points,
it
is
important
just
to
notice
with
respect
to
the
suits,
the
objections
to
the
various
claims,
the
suits
that
were
dropped,
but
what
we're
objecting
to
is
that
although
each
plan
said
that
suits
are
reserved,
all
suits
are
reserved,
all
causes
of
action
reserved
that
the
trustee
did
not
just
make
on
the
advise
of
his
counsel
that
judgment
of
these
were
not
worthy
of
prosecution,
but
that
he
made
a
deal
not
to
prosecute
them;
that
it
was
part
of
the
deal
and
it
was
only
disclosed
in
part
three
years
later
and
another
part
four
years
later.
this
we
say
is
no
way
to
run
a
reorganization.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
think
that
passage
of
it,
your
honor,
is
already
in
the
record.
i
know
it's
in
the
record.
we've
cited
it
in
the
record
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
when
there
was
a
contention
that
everything
was
disclosed
at
the
shaffer-spitzer.
we've
cited
the
passages
in
the
record
in
our
reply
brief.
one
final
point
on
the
law
of
the
case,
mr.
simmons
has
made
again
i
think
in
inadvertent
statement
which
he
said
that
the
plan
was
returned
at
the
time
of
the
second
appeal
only,
and
i'm
quoting
him,
for
determination
of
its
feasibility.
he
is
i
think
quoting
but
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
returned
only
for
determination
of
its
feasibility.
on
the
third
appeal
whether
its
contention
was
made
that
the
law
of
the
case
covered
everything
and
i
quote
from
the
third
appeal
364
f.2d
at
936,
where
the
district
court
said
the
decisions
of
the
appellate
court
sent
the
plan
of
reorganization
back
only
for
determined
feasibility
of
the
plan.
the
fifth
circuit
said
on
the
third
appeal,
“we
do
not
agree
but
hold
that
this
court's
reversal
of
the
order
of
confirmation
left
open
those
issues
not
in
terms
discussed
and
decided”.
the
only
issue
that
was
discussed
and
decided
with
respect
to
us
was
the
matter
or
decided
against
us
was
the
prophylactic
barring
of
the
trustee.
this
is
why
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
exercise
its
supervisory
function
and
why
this
court
has
to
step
in
and
exercise
its
supervisory
function
because
on
each
of
the
first
two
appeals
where
we
had
raised
all
almost
of
these
questions,
although
the
plans
were
set
aside
and
this
is
important,
perhaps
i
didn't
make
this
clear
in
response
to
your
question
yesterday,
mr.
justice
harlan.
on
our
first
appeal
of
claim
was
set
aside
and
our
second
appeal,
the
claim
was
set
aside
but
they
were
set
aside
on
collateral
grounds
which
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
find
necessary
to
consider
the
particular
questions
that
we
had
raised
except
by
indirection
where
it
said
that
the
court
could
act,
the
court
below
on
the
first
appeal
could
act
on
the
findings
ofthe
trustee
had
belatedly
made
with
respect
to
the
shaffer-spitzer
and
could
set
aside
the
first
plan
for
fraud.
this
is
the
reason
why
we've
brought
the
case
here
under
the
supervisory
power
primarily
and
this
is
the
reason
why
we
say
that
there
can
be
a
mandate
and
there
can
be
instructions
and
there
can
be
an
opinion
that
without
going
into
details
bickerings
about
petty
facts
here,
acting
only
on
what
is
claimed
in
the
record
will
clean
up
reorganization
again.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
corporate
reorganization
case
arising
under
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
comes
here
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
originated
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
where
the
company
under
reorganization
has
its
home
port
and
principal
office.
it's
in
the
business
of
supplying
ocean
shipping
service
of
a
specialized
nature.
it
falls
well
or
highway
rather
trailers
overseas,
the
maritime
equivalent
of
railroad
fleet.
the
petitioner
protective
committee
consists
of
a
small
group
of
small
stockholders
who
hold
authorizations
from
like
stockholders,
but
they
have
attempted
throughout
10
years
in
three
reorganization
plans
involved
here
to
discharge
their
responsibility
to
the
whole
group
of
public
stockholders
and
not
insofar
as
the
record
shows
to
over
7000
stockholders
who
hold
over
one
million
eight
hundred
thousand
shares
of
stock
which
was
sold
to
them
in
an
original
flotation
or
a
series
of
flotations
of
stock
of
this
company
at
prices
up
to
$4.5
and
$5
a
share
in
a
rig
market
for
the
most
part
in
violation
of
the
1933
securities
act,
so
far
as
registration
is
concerned
and
also
in
violation
of
various
fraud
provisions
that
would
be
applicable
under
both
of
1933
and
1934
act.
the
protective
committee
seeks
to
set
aside
this
plan
of
reorganization,
the
third
as
i
said
which
excluded
the
stockholders
from
participation
in
the
reorganized
company.
they
say
that
this
reorganization
is
a
rehearsal
of
the
classic
pattern
of
the
reorganization
scandals
of
generation
ago
that
resulted
in
chapter
10.
scattered
innocent
security
holders
are
excluded
from
the
reorganization
which
has
been
dominated
we
say
by
the
people
who
wreck
the
old
company
and
notwithstanding
charges
of
mismanagement
and
fraud
against
them,
they
come
out
either
with
priorities
or
with
control
of
the
company.
we
served
as
brown's
proportion
not
a
long
trail
court
errors
of
law
particularly
in
the
area
of
valuation
law
and
securities
law
but
that
there
is
a
pervading
failure
on
the
part
of
both
courts
below
to
hold
the
trustee
who
in
chapter
10
is
the
key
to
a
fair
and
honest
reorganization
to
the
performance
of
the
statutory
duties.
we
say
that
he
performed
belated
and
inadequate
investigations
particularly
of
charges
of
fraud
against
the
people
who
ran
the
company
and
come
out
on
top.
we
say
that
he
made
some
errors
of
securities
law
which
mr.
ferber
for
the
sec
proposed
to
discuss
a
little
bit
later,
but
we
say
that
basically
what
was
wrong
was
that
both
courts
refused
to
hold
the
trustee
to
his
duties
of
investigation,
particularly
of
frauds
of
disclosure,
particularly
of
compromises
with
people
charged
with
fraud
and
in
one
instance
established
so
far
as
the
trustee
himself
is
concerned
by
an
investigation
which
he
had
made,
which
came
up
for
the
demonstration
of
fraud
to
his
satisfaction
on
the
basis
of
which
he
recommended
for
example
that
under
the
taylor
triborough
doctrine
those
people
should
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
reorganization,
but
they
came
out
on
top.
and
we
say
that
he
failed
to
disclose
the
basis
of
his
comprises
with
and
after
they
had
been
charged
with
fraud
which
had
never
been
recorded.
he
failed
to
bring
into
the
record
various
facts
which
are
of
importance
on
valuation.
he
fudged
we
say,
some
of
the
valuation
facts
which
were
in
the
record
and
most
important
of
all
he
failed
in
his
basic
duty
for
which
the
statute
imposed
upon
him
of
independence.
he
had
a
fiduciary
duty
under
the
statute
to
stay
it
on
the
length
with
all
the
people
in
the
reorganization
and
instead
he
entered
into
alliances
with
them.
for
example
the
largest
single
creditor
whose
case
i
shall
discuss
in
a
moment
turned
up
on
the
board
of
directors
with
him
and
he
himself
on
the
board
of
directors,
a
fact
which
the
sec
proposes
to
argue
as
having
special
significance.
and
we
say
that
he
had
a
duty
to
accept
no
favors
at
the
hands
of
the
people
with
whom
he
was
required
to
deal
and
with
whom
he
made
these
compromises.
we
say
he
violated
these
--
his
duty
by
accepting
his
position
as
president
of
the
new
company
at
the
hands
of
people
charged
with
fraud
and
also
at
the
hands
of
people
who
were
discount
claim
buyers
who
were
interested
in
patronage
and
they
too
sit
on
the
board
with
him
now.
sir,
this
is
the
third
time
that
the
case
has
been
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
our
complaints
here,
the
reason
that
we
presented
the
case
under
the
supervisory
power
rather
than
just
under
conflicts
is
that
we
felt
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
share
of
the
responsibility
for
happened
here
that
on
the
first
two
appeals,
on
the
first
one
we
raised
some
of
these
points
that
we
are
now
raising,
on
the
second
appeal
we
raised
all
of
them,
passed
them
off,
didn't
issue
advisory
guidance
on
these
points,
dismissed
them
as
moot
and
thereby
encouraged
the
court
below
to
encourage
the
trustee
it
his
dereliction
of
duty.
and
on
the
third
one
its
plain
from
the
opinion
and
the
court
said
this
case
has
been
here
nine
years,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
we
might
just
well
let
it
go
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
pretty
well
bored
with
it
and
never
looked
into
it
and
this
is
why
we
brought
it
here
as
a
matter
of
the
supervisory
power.
in
the
first
appeal
it
was
our
position
and
it
was
dismissed
as
moot.
the
second
appeal
and
it
was
combined
with
another
appeal
in
which
the
main
question
of
setting
aside
the
first
plan
for
fraud
was
brought
up
on
certiorari.
the
second
appeal,
we
didn't
bring
certiorari
although
the
government
on
a
collateral
point
that
is
collateral
presentation
did.
the
third
time
around
we
brought
certiorari
because
only
then
was
it
then
squarely
presented.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no
sir.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
is
quite
true
that
certiorari
was
denied
but
it
was
not,
it
was
not
our
committee
who
asked
for
it.
in
the
first
case
mr.
shaffer
and
spitzer
who
filed
the
brief
here
filed
for
certiorari
denied,
in
the
second
case
the
custody
himself
on
a
collateral
question
to
the
government
priority
rate,
filed
for
certiorari
also
denied
and
the
third
time
we
brought
it
here.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
the
priority,
well
really
the
priority
of
non-tax
plan.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
now,
what
i
think
illustrates
what
happened
here
and
what
we
complain
now
first
is
the
treatment
of
the
claim
of
merrill-stevens
dry-dock
and
repair
company,
which
is
the
shipyard
that
had
the
largest
single
creditor
claim
in
the
case.
merrill-stevens
claimed
amount
of
about
$1,600,000.
most
of
it
was
for
conversation
work
on
the
company's
self
propelled
vessel
called
the
carib
queen.
what
immediately
provoked
the
reorganization
was
the
fact
that
the
carib
queen
on
her
maiden
voyage
to
france
had
a
boiler
blowup
and
this
crippled
the
queen
and
the
crippled
the
company
and
led
to
reorganization.
of
course
the
validity
of
that
claim
just
as
a
matter
of
a
commercial
claim
was
a
better
subject
of
dispute.
when
a
boiler
blows
up
and
a
vessel
is
put
out
of
commission,
so
that
the
company
has
to
limp
along
after
that
has
it
did
during
the
reorganization
with
barges
only,
there
is
a
lot
of
serious
problem
involved
and
this
was
at
first
disposed
off
by
the
trustee
notwithstanding
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
not
alone
the
queen
that
it
had
been
subject
to
shoddy
workmanship,
but
another
vessel
had
capsized
after
having
been
designed
by
merrill-stevens,
still
another
vessel
had
been
put
out
of
the
shipyard
with
some
defect
in
discharge
line,
which
of
course
at
the
swamp
and
sink
and
there
were
all
of
these
shall
we
say
commercial
defenses.
the
trustee
recommended
payment
in
full,
after
an
off
the
record
of
investigation.
the
security
and
exchange
commission
made
its
own
investigation,
purely
on
the
question
of
what
i
might
call
a
commercial
claim.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
defenses.
they
weren't
perfect,
but
they
should
either
be
litigated
out
for
if
an
appropriate
settlement
whose
dimension
that
commission
wasn't
prepared
the
state
within
the
week
it
should
be
settled
out.
we
the
committee
were
dissatisfied
with
that,
just
as
we
had
been
dissatisfied
with
some
earlier
refusals
of
the
trustee
to
investigate.
we
obtained
leave
from
the
court
to
investigate
and
we
made
a
further
investigation,
as
a
result
of
which
we
turned
out
charges
and
we
outlined
the
evidence
of
fraud
by
merrill-stevens,
its
largest
creditor.
the
essence
of
the
fraud,
the
details
i
have
to
skim
over
consisted
of
participation
in
a
fraud
by
other
people
in
the
case.
the
other
people
in
the
case
are
a
group
headed
by
a
man
named
abrams,
a
notorious
stock
swindler
who
was
in
federal
prison
at
the
time
of
this
reorganization,
although
not
convicted
of
any
matters
involved
in
this
company,
a
representative
of
a
respectable
security
house,
a
man
named
shaffer.
the
trustee
in
a
belated
investigation
that
wasted
three
years
of
this
reorganization,
the
one
that
resulted
in
the
first
certiorari
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about,
had
found
that
abrams
and
shaffer
had
wrecked
this
company,
that
there
had
been
in
the
pre-reorganization
stage
a
large
number
of
sales
of
securities,
most
of
them
in
violation
of
the
securities
act
and
fraudulent
by
virtue
of
the
techniques
that
i
have
mentioned.
and
furthermore
he
had
found
notwithstanding
denials
by
m/s.
shaffer
and
spitzer
and
some
of
the
people
associated
with
them,
that
shaffer
and
spitzer
who
came
into
reorganization
posing
as
innocent
mortgagee
title
holders,
actually
knew
that
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
mortgage
that
they
have
and
which
wound
up
with
the
priority
were
to
a
large
extent
owned
by
shaffer
and
by
abrams,
directors
of
the
records
of
the
company
but
this
was
hidden.
and
this
was
the
crime
--
this
was
the
matter
that
it
had
led
to
this
first
plan.
the
trustee
refused
to
accept
leads
that
we
had
offered
him
showing
the
connection
and
it
wasn't
until
three
years
later
as
a
result
of
an
independent
investigation
by
the
sec
followed
by
a
thorough
so
far
as
it
went
investigation
on
167,
the
statute
section
that
provides
for
formal
investigation,
full
investigation
that
these
things
were
discovered
and
at
that
time
the
trustee
recommended
that
shaffer's
spitzer
should
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
heap,
that
there
should
be
suits
pressed
against
them
against
the
individuals
behind
them
that
there
should
be.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
on
behalf
of
the
company
and
also
the
point
or
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
faber
proposed
to
discuss
that
the
individual
stockholders
who
had
been
defrauded
by
the
company
had
a
position
to
creditors
just
as
if
they
have
been
run
down
by
a
company
truck
or
had
failed
to
receive
goods.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
he
said
the
company
had
claims
on
the
individual--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sure,
he
recommended
the
assertion
of
both
sets
of
claims,
the
company
claim
against
these
people,
the
stockholder
claim
against
these
people
and
also
he
recommended
that
there
should
be
an
offset
against
this
innocent
appearing
mortgage
which
was
on
the
most
crucial
assets
that
the
company
had
and
which
had
been
put
by
these
people
who
wrecked
the
company.
on
these
assets,
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
for
the
option
to
turn
them
all,
again
the
stock
that
everything
went
well
and
with
the
stranglehold
in
case
everything
worked
out
to
nothing
as
look
to
be
the
case
at
that
time.
now,
essentially
what
i
have
said
a
the
shaffer
spitzer
group
and
it's
first
reorganization
plan
was
a
digression
because
my
interest
in
it
is
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
were
charges
of
fraud
against
this
group.
and
that
they
had
been
established
by
the
trustee
on
the
record
in
the
result
of
an
investigation
although
belatedly.
and
we
have
said
also
in
this
further
investigation
that
we
had
made
that
the
merrill-stevens
group
allied
themselves
with
this,
stop
pushing
in
this
fraud
because
they
too
had
connive
with
management
and
with
the
people
who
are
dominating
management
and
it's
financial
matters
to
commit
a
fraud
upon
the
maritime
administration
and
upon
the
public.
again
without
going
into
the
detail
of
it
because
it
has
never
been
investigated
in
fact
there
happens
not
to
be
a
formal
denial
of
it
on
the
record.
a
portion
of
the
stock
portion
was
achieved
in
this
case
by
representation
as
to
a
maritime
commission
guarantee
on
the
construction
mortgage
of
the
carib
queen
in
her
reconversion
of
the
company's
use.
the
mortgage
had
been
guaranteed
by
the
maritime
commission,
which
made
a
statutory
finding
which
was
much
advertised
by
the
stock
pushers
that
the
enterprise
was
economically
sound
and
that
guarantee
could
not
have
issued
nor
that
representation
had
been
made
use
of
in
the
sales
or
not
for
fraud
practices
upon
the
maritime
administration
by
a
mortgaging
out
procedure.
the
statue
under
which
the
maritime
administration
operates
initially
in
these
loan
guarantees
requires
that
a
certain
fraction
of
the
cost
to
be
paid
in
cash,
it
was
not.
although
it
was
paid
in
cash,
there
was
a
hidden
under-the-table
deal
whereby
the
cash
would
return
right
back
to
the
company
in
exchange
for
company
stock
at
an
arbitrary
price.
the
company
was
at
the
time
putting
stock
down
on
the
markets
who,
the
hands
of
its
friends
and
people
who
controlled
it
for
all
sorts
of
prices
and
for
nothing.
so
this
was
way
in
which
we
said
that
there
had
been
a
fraud
on
the
part
of
this
major
creditor.
now
with
respect
to
both
these
creditors
the
mortgagee
group
and
the
trustee
had
found
guilty
of
fraud
and
the
shipyard
when
we
had
alleged
in
detail
although
there
had
been
no
formal
investigation
was
guilty
of
fraud
nothing
happened
so
far
as
the
trustee
was
concerned
by
way
of
action
on
that
fraud.
indeed
at
one
point
in
support
of
our
charges
of
fraud
against
merrill-stevens
we
attempted
to
bring
into
the
record
by
ordinary
discovery
procedures,
motion
to
produce
and
so
on
some
documents
bearing
on
it
which
we
described
after
we
located
them
that
the
trustee
said
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
he
hadn't
found
them
and
the
trustee
opposed
our
attempt
to
obtain
them
by
ordinary
discovery
procedures.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
would
like
the
court
to
rule
as
follows.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
first
that
a
reorganization
conducted
by
a
trustee
in
disregard
of
his
responsibilities
to
investigate
and
his
responsibilities
to
disclose
results
in
a
reorganization
plan
which
has
to
be
set
aside
because
the
trustee's
functions
under
the
statute
are
too
important
to
trifle
with.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
think
there
is
some
bickering
about
it
in
the
briefs.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
regard
it
as
myself
substantially
settled
because
i
can
find
the
counsel
has
not
been
able
to
cite
any
cases
to
the
contrary.
next
we
would
like
to
have
the
court
rule
on
the
disqualifications
of
the
trustee
through
making
alliances
with
people
whom
he
ought
to
kept
at
arm's
length
and
because
section
221(5)
of
the
act
requires
that
as
a
precondition
of
confirming
a
plan
that
the
court
must
take
a
look
back
over
what's
happened
in
the
reorganization
and
satisfy
itself
of
the
independence
of
the
trustee
that
the
plan
is
bad
if
the
trustee
isn't
independent.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yeah.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
and
the
sec
was
running
this
on
the
ground
of
prophylactic
rule
that
no
matter
of
what
the
facts
the
trustee
has
no
business
being
president
of
the
company,
the
way
there
has
been
a
disputed
reorganization
plan,
we
say
that
while
we
agree
with
that
position
perhaps
because
we
are
closer
to
the
facts.
we
don't
have
this
magisterial
view
that
the
sec
has
that
on
the
particular
facts
the
trustee
disqualified
himself
because
he
made
alliances
with
the
people
that
he
was
supposed
to
create
fiduciary
in
fashion
and
not
make
alliances
with
them,
not
get
any
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
one
contention
was
ruled
on
against
us
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
what
i
call
a
prophylactic
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
left
open
the
question
of
whether
a
lack
of
independence
in
fact
was
available
to
us.
it
said
that
if
we
prove
that
it
was
in
--
that
he
didn't
have
independence
in
fact
that
at
that
point
we
would
have
a
bad
point.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
well,
there
are
other
grounds
that
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
mr.
justice.
we
are
asking
you
to
look
at
the
record.
we
have
summarized
the
record
and
while
there
is
dispute
i
think
on
some
of
the
fringes
of
the
fact,
there
is
no
dispute
i
think
as
to
the
main
fact
here,
although
i
was
somewhat
surprised
by,
in
the
reply
briefs
and
kind
of
a
general
denial
and
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
it's
vigorously
general
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir,
i
think
so,
but
there
are
lot
of
things
that
need
diagnose
here
and
-–
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
think
so.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
there
are
multiple
grounds
upon
which
we
advance
this
case.
one
ground
i
haven't
even
mentioned
except
as
a
rubric
the
fact
the
district
court
announced
and
allowed
the
application
of
what
we
consider
to
be
a
rule
of
valuation
law
that
is
utterly
contrary
to
every
case
that
this
court
has
had
on
the
subject.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
if
you
can
disclose
it
short
by
the
prophylactic
rule
and
if
it
follows
from
that
as
we
say
that
the
plan
itself
is
bad
if
the
trustee
is
independent
then
the
plan
goes
back,
but
what
i
am
afraid
of,
very
much
afraid
of
in
view
of
the
history
of
what
happens
when
there
is
no
affiliate
guidance
in
this
case
that
we
are
in
for
more
of
the
same.
we've
had
10
years
of
this
litigation.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no
your
honor
we
insist
that
the
trustees'
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
now
we
say
that
there
are
other
things
wrong
with
the
plan.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right,
sir.
so
that
i
think
if
you
would
nearly
disposed
off
the
thing
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
trustee
shouldn't
become
president,
that
wouldn't
answer
case.
it's
our
view
that
what
the
trustee
did
on
the
way
to
becoming
president
compromised
the
whole
record,
made
it
impossible
for
one
to
make
a
fair
determination
as
for
example
the
facts
that
he
put
into
the
record
on
valuation.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh!
yes
we
did
sir.
not
on
the
first
plan,
although
he
was
president
in
the
first
plan
too,
but
in
the
second
plan
and
in
the
third
plan
we
objected
and
in
the
proceedings
below
we
objected.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
it
happens
that
that
there
are
no
precedents
on
the
subject
and
i
need
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
am
certain
that
there
are
procedures
available
although
the
statute
doesn't
spell
them
out
–
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
it
would
be
too
outrageous
if
one
didn't
have
that,
but
we
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
remove
the
trustee
by
an
independent
procedure.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
there
is
a
claim
remedy
available
for
an
non-independent
trustee
knock
out
the
plan
and
as
a
core
committee
we
even
had
to
have
the
court
under
the
old
rules
weigh
depending
on
the
record,
we
couldn't
afford
to
go
up
on
every
side
skirmish.
most
of
the
trustee's
lack
of
independence
was
built
up
during
the
proceedings
that
lasted
very
few
months
in
the
formulation
of
the
second
plan.
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
began
to
realize
that
the
trustee
was
withholding
evidence
from
the
record,
that
the
trustee
was
making
alliances
with
people
with
whom
we
thought
he
shouldn't
make
alliances
that
he
was
granting
sweetheart
contracts
for
example
to
one
of
these
claim
buyer
that
cost
the
company
a
$100,000
a
year
over
the
nearest
competitive
bid
that
he
was
running
off
people
majors
in
the
industry
i
am
talking
about
the
towing
contract,
majors
in
the
industry
whom
we
brought
in
and
whom
he
refused
to
allow
to
have
information
that
he
was
running
off
bidders
whom
we
proposed
to
bring
in
because
he
wouldn't
give
them
information
that
he
was
rejecting
a
cash
plan
which
was
offered
by
an
alternative
bidder
whom
we
didn't
bring
in
to
the
case.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir
they
are.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
to
the
extent
that
they
are
un-denied
we
–-
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
not
solely
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
un-denied
in
the
record.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
that
the
court
doesn't
go
into
such
as
resolving
disputes
of
fact
that
have
been
resolved
by
the
judge.
but
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
in
a
brief
says
that
where
we
say
we
charge
fraud
against
merrill-stevens
and
one
of
the
answering
brief
says
no,
they
never
charged
fraud
against
merrill-stevens,
that's
merely
cited
on
the
brief,
shouldn't
preclude
the
court
from
what
is
unpleasant
and
difficult
duty
most
of
which
probably
does
get
turned
over
to
the
courts,
going
to
the
record
and
finding
out
whether
what
we
say
is
so.
this
occurs
anytime
that
there
is
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
trial
court
justice.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
i
think
we
can
sir.
we
think
that
this
was
a
primary
duty
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
we
said
these
very
things
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
chapter
and
verse
citation
to
this
record
that
it
was
the
court
of
appeals'
duty
not
to
flip
this
off
as
it
did
saying
well
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
but
when
we
say
that
the
record
is
poisoned,
they
may
have
taken
a
look
at
the
record,
but
what
they
did
was
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
when
we
said
that
the
trustee
derelictions
of
duty
were
compounded
by
errors
of
law
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court,
for
example
in
enunciating
a
wrong
rule
of
evaluation
law
and
when
we
say
that
the
trustee
prevented
us
from
having
a
true
evaluation
of
the
proper
number
of
claims,
that
at
that
point
this
passes
beyond
the
boundary
of
discretion.
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
something,
the
court
has
the
evidence
before
and
it
ruled
as
it
--
as
it
had
the
right
to
rule
on
disputed
questions
of
fact.
this
not
discretion.
this
is
error
of
law
particularly
in
the
area
where
we
say
--
particularly
in
the
area
where
we
say
that
the
trustee
who
has
the
duty
of
making
up
a
record
for
the
court
distorted
the
record.
the
court
didn't
pass
on
those
issues
in
fact.
these
are
very
serious
charges.
they
go
the
essence
of
bankruptcy
as
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
is
one
ground
that
we
certainly
have
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well
not
just
to
knock
out
those
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that's
right.
we
think
the
case
law
says
that
and
likewise
we
say
that
on
the
other
major
issues
here
valuation
and
wrong
standard.
valuation
--
wrong
standard,
that's
a
matter
of
law
and
when
the
trustee
acting
under
that
wrong
standard
doesn't
bring
into
the
record
or
the
court
keeps
out
of
the
record
evidence
for
example
of
the
present
trends
of
the
company,
where
he
allows
the
company
to
be
valued
on
the
basis
of
three
ships,
although
in
fact
there
are
four
now,
where
he
allows
the
company
to
valued
on
the
basis
of
barges
although
the
trustee
has
well
matured
plans.
he's
been
spending
company
money,
going
out
and
investigating
another
type
of
ship,
which
he
says
is
going
to
make
it
cheaper
to
run.
that
at
that
point
that
evidence
has
got
to
come
into
the
record
and
the
trial
judge
said,
no
it
can't
come
into
the
record.
i'm
not
interested
in
anything
expect
what's
happening
now.
this
is
a
type
of
thing
that
we
say
you
have
to
go
beyond
in
order
to
stop
this
from
happening
again.
that
this
[inaudible]
is
one
of
these
fields
and
reorganization
is
one
of
these
fields,
it
just
requires
supervision
every
now
and
then.
this
is
what
makes
bankruptcy
ring.
we
say
to
the
court
to
look
into
these
things
in
every
once
in
a
while
i
am
reminded
of
the
right
to
consultation
from
the
days
of
[inaudible]
julian
wayneright.
he
would
bring
them
up
here
and
we'd
come
up
with
charges
and
the
court
would
have
to
look
into
the
record
and
see
what
happened.
unpleasant
job,
unpleasant
to
all
of
you,
unpleasant
to
investigate.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
do
it,
we
are
committed
to
do
the
duty
of
this
court's
[inaudible]
and
the
jury
as
well.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
reply
only
very
briefly
to
mr.
spitzer's
discussion.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
going
to
reply
only
very
briefly,
sir
to
mr.
spitzer's
discussion.
because
most
of
it
is
what
i
characterized
yesterday
as
bickering
in
the
responding
brief
and
also
answered
by
more
bickering
i'm
afraid
in
our
reply
brief.
we
have
attempted
to
set
out
specific
citations
to
the
record
that
places
of
which
we
think
mr.
spitzer
is
in
error
in
his
view
of
what
was
actually
in
the
record.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
say,
sir
that
mr.
spitzer
cannot
come
here
and
talk
about
equities
when
all
compromises,
when
our
position
on
it,
mr.
justice
black,
is
not
on
the
merits
of
the
mortgage.
he
may
have
a
good
mortgage;
he
may
have
a
bad
mortgage.
our
position
on
it
from
the
first
was
that
he
was
not
or
his
clients
were
not
in
any
position
of
being
able
to
assert
their
commercial
rights
under
the
mortgage
because
they
were
in
fact
acting
as
cloaks
for
people
who
wrecked
this
company.
and
that
no
matter
what
the
commercial
situation
with
respect
to
the
mortgage,
the
trustee
at
first
brought
that
very
bitterly
that
they
cannot
estop
anybody
because
they
are
covers
for
frauds.this
was
a
position
that
we
wondered
about
to
begin
with.
very
early
in
the
proceedings,
mr.
spitzer
was
asked
in
open
court,
“is
there
is
mr.
joe
abrams
interested
in
or
who
is
a
part
of
that
group?”,referring
to
his
settings.
mr.
spitzer:
“there
is
no
joe
--
mr.
joe
abrams
in
our
group.
he
has
an
interest
in
i
believe
in
--
no
there
is
not.
no.”
so,
at
that
point,
there
was
a
disclaimer
of
any
interest
by
--
in
the
group
by
the
man
who
was
primarily
along
with
his
other
client,
mr.
shaffer,
so
the
trustee
found
in
his
ultimate
investigation
the
prime
record
of
this
company.
it
was
only
when
we
turned
up
evidence
which
we
tended
to
the
trustee
in
which
he
rejected
that
there
really
was
a
joe
abrams
behind
this
and
when
the
sec
turned
up
more
evidence
that
ultimately
the
trustee
was
forced
to
set
aside
his
first
plan
which
it
turned
the
whole
company
over
to
these
people.
now,
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
that
they
cannot
be
in
a
position
of
saying,
“we're
innocent
equity
people
here.
we
have
equities
with
us.
we
were
sucked
into
a
compromise.”
we
say
that
they
were
sucked
into
a
compromise,
the
terms
of
that
compromise
whenever
fully
disclosed.
the
basis
for
that
compromise
was
never
fully
disclosed
as
i
argued
yesterday.
what
right
therefore
do
they
have
to
sit
here
innocently
and
say,
“everybody
is
estopped?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
made
a
deal."
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
with
respect
to
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
didn't
know
what
the
detail
facts
of
the
settlement
were.
we
had
presented
all
the
facts
of
the
fraud.
we
had
presented
or
the
trustee
had
finally
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes,
we
did.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
there
was
a
passage
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
he
misleds.
there's
a
passage
in
the
record
in
which
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
let
me
just
read
what
happened
here,
sir.
he
was
asked
regarding
the
alleged
compromises
of
the
shaffer-spitzer
mortgage
claim
and
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
would
you
give
us
some
indication
as
to
the
basis
of
this
compromises.
now
this
was
after
the
facts
were
out,
that
there
was
a
fraud
here
permitted
by
their
shaffer-spitzer
principle.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
sorry,
sir.
“i'll
be
glad
to,”
he
says,
“i'll
be
glad
to”.
and
on
the
next
page,
he's
asked
again
about
shaffer-spitzer
and
he
says,
“the
compromise
of
a
claim,
the
caplan
claim,
was
worked
out
between
the
attorney
for
the
group,
my
attorney
and
myself
was
done
in
conference;
all
three
of
us
had
with
the
court,
completed
after
deliberations,
negotiations,
submitted
to
the
court,
approved
by
the
court.
that's
the
way
we
came
about
to
reach
that
compromise.
so
he
states
where
it
happened,
“in
chambers”
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
“who
was
there”
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
didn't
pursue
for
the
reason
that
the
court
at
that
very
point
was
telling
everybody,
“look,
i
have
a
jury
coming
in
here.
i
can't
sit
around
here
all
day
and
listen
to
wrangling
about
this.
you
can
submit
a
memorandum.”
and
the
sec
submitted
a
memorandum
in
which
it
raised
this
very
point
and
we
joined
in
the
memorandum.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
it
beforehand
and
we
were
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
further
objections.
we
objected
to
it
when
the
plan
first
came
out.
we
said
you
can
have
a
plan
with
these
compromises
in
them
uninvestigated,
with
the
basis
not
stated.
then
when
mr.
gonson,
sec
counsel,
made
this
direct
inquiry,
“what's
the
basis?”
i
read
the
answer.
and
on
--
we
said
the
same
thing
and
made
these
objections
again
not
alone
at
approval
time,
at
a
confirmation
time,
at
appeal
time
on
both
the
version
of
the
final
plan
that
was
--
what
we
call
the
second
plan
and
the
version
of
plan
that
we
call
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
all
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
objected
to
all
of
these
points.
i
can't
tell
the
court
that
we
said
that
there
had
to
be
a
further
hearing
after
there
was
an
order
of
approval
came
out.
we'd
raise
the
same
points
again
and
again
and
again,
we'd
ask
the
hearings
on
them
again
and
again
and
again
particularly
with
respect
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim
and
we
had
insisted
throughout
this
proceeding.
one
further
point
should
be
mentioned
here.
we
are
a
committee.
we
are
intended
to
be
holding
a
watching
brief.
it
is
our
responsibility
to
the
people
whom
we
represent,
some
7000
stockholders,
who
have
paid
many
millions
of
dollars
under
this
fraudulent
scheme
to
float
stock,
how
much
of
it
reached
the
company
ultimately.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
we
know
from
the
extent
of
the
record
that
has
been
made,
a
good
deal
of
it,
many
hundreds
of
thousand
dollars
of
it
were
(inaudible).
our
position
here
is
to
point
out
what
needs
to
be
done,
to
suggest
what
needs
to
be
done,
to
try
and
do
it
if
it
isn't
done.
but
when
we
are
blocked,
at
that
point
it
becomes
the
court's
own
responsibility
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
take
an
affirmative
responsibility
for
the
fairness
of
a
plan
which
is
his
duty
under
chapter
x.
whether
we
object
before,
during
or
after
and
we
did.
we
think
we've
done
all
that
we
needed
to
do
as
the
court's
responsibility
and
the
trustee's
fiduciary
responsibility.
let
me
turn
more
directly
now,
if
i
may,
to
mr.
simmons'
position.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
something
he
said
at
the
very
start
of
his
discussion
which
he
said
it's
going
to
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
read
all
seven
volumes
of
this
record.
i'm
afraid
as
i
said
yesterday
that
it
was
going
to
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
read
a
little
more
of
this
record
than
i
would
like
to
have
read
just
because
of
these
matters
of
detail
of
the
fact.
but
none
of
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
ordinarily
refuses
to
read
by
way
of
looking
over
to
see
whether
or
not
a
district
judge
has
made
appropriate
findings
of
fact
on
an
issue
presented
to
him.
of
course
there
are
disputes
of
fact.
mr.
simmons
insists
that
there
never
wasn't
a
--
any
real
charges
of
fraud
by
us
against
merrill-stevens.
and
all
we
can
do
is
ask
the
court
to
read
our
specifications
in
which
we
say
that
they
joined
themselves
in
with
the
basic
shaffer-spitzer
we
call
it,
it
could
just
as
well
be
called
abrams
and
shaffer
because
they
are
the
ultimate
defrauders.
mr.
shaffer
and
mr.
spitzer
in
our
view
are
merely
gnawing
close
for
shaffer
himself
and
abrams
as
himself
on
it.
we
objected
to
the
claim
on
fraud
grounds
because
there
were
misrepresentation
as
to
this
carib
queen
as
to
her
speed,
her
performance,
whether
or
not
she'd
been
mortgaged
out.
all
these
matters
that
were
essential
to
the
fraud.
this,
the
court
will
have
to
read.
likewise,
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
just
see
whether
i'm
right
or
whether
mr.
spitzer
is
right
when
he
says
both
in
his
brief
and
here
that
the
group
behind
the
shaffer-spitzer
mortgage
was
“plainly
disclosed”.
the
briefs
themselves
operators
and
indexed
to
the
record.
but
the
most
important
thing
that
i'd
do
want
to
state
with
respect
to
this
question
of
how
much
you
have
to
read
is
really
an
answer
to
the
question
that
i
started
to
answer
yesterday
when
justice
fortas
asked
me
about
it.
but
what
do
we
want
here?
it's
our
position
that
nothing
that
we
want
is
going
to
require
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
determinations
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
even
where
we
asked
for
review
of
something
that
is
a
mix
batch
in
effect
in
law,
the
matter
of
insolvency
evaluation.
what
we're
objecting
to
there
is
the
adoption
and
the
enforcement
of
a
rule
of
law
by
the
district
court
which
we
say
is
in
--
just
counter
distinction
to
the
rules
of
law
that
this
court
had
always
enforced
and
said
in
the
area
of
evaluation.
that
it
is
necessarily
a
matter
of
future,
i
think
that
it
is
necessarily
a
matter
or
probability
and
that
all
evidence
which
now
exists
bearing
on
the
future
earnings
of
the
company
must
be
presented
to
the
court.
and
for
that
reason
we
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
discuss
even
on
this
one
question
which
might
be
of
question
of
fact,
any
of
the
detailed
underlying
facts
because
the
facts
are
really
admitted
in
here.
the
disputes
of
facts
are
fringed
disputes.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
undisputed
on
that,
that
you
cannot
value
we
think
a
company,
which
during
the
reorganization
has
grown
from
300
to
600
trailers
from
three
to
five
ships
as
this
court
--
the
district
court
insisted
it
be
valued.
as
it
is
now,
a
three-ship
company,
when
their
turning
away
business
all
the
time
and
find
new
ships
and
planning
improved
ships
and
spending
estate
money
on
those
plans
and
spending
a
estate
time
on
those
plans,
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
fact.
similarly,
on
the
question
whether
there
should
be
a
full
investigation,
it
is
a
matter
of
law
we
say.
four
courts
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
four
of
the
circuits
have
said
that
you've
got
to
have
a
full
investigation
on
the
record
instead
of
the
kind
of
investigation
that
was
had
here
off
the
record
with
the
trustee
even
turning
down
and
objecting
to
us
and
blocking
us
when
we
wanted
to
get
discovery
of
some
of
the
most
important
facts
here
that
we
had
found
in
third-party
hands.
similarly,
when
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
full
disclosure
of
the
basis
of
compromise,
it
is
a
fact
that
the
compromise
basis
was
not
stated
on
the
record
and
three
more
of
the
circuit
courts
which
we've
cited
in
the
briefs
have
said
this.
it's
our
view
that
it's
this
court's
function
and
responsibility
in
response
really
to
justice
fortas'
question
as
what
we
want
here,
to
make
it
clear
that
the
law
is
the
same
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
the
law
should
be
the
same
throughout
the
country
so
that
we
don't
have
the
danger
of
what
happens,
what
is
traditionally
happened.
what
caused
chapter
x,
people
without
any
supervision,
running
bankruptcies
to
suit
themselves,
friendly
trustees,
private
deals.
another
thing
that
we
think
the
court
must
enunciate
as
a
rule
of
law
here
is
that
the
trustee
must
put
under
an
affirmative
duty
to
bring
in
to
the
record
all
the
evidence
that
there's
on
valuation.
mr.
simmons,
i'm
sure
inadvertently
made
a
mistake
--
meant
there
when
he
said,
that
our
own
expert,
the
committee's
expert
valued
this
property
at
only
$4,500,000
as
a
going
concern
value.
there
is
a
passage
in
the
record.
i
could
quote
it
but
i
will
cite
it.
we've
also
cited
it
on
the
brief
at
pages
246
to
248
of
the
record
that
we
call
roman
ii
here
in
which
the
thrust
--
in
which
our
officer
says
--
our
--
i'm
sorry.
in
which
our
expert
says
that
the
officers
of
the
company,
the
trustee,
have
not
furnished
him
with
only
information
he
needs
to
determine
how
much
higher,
how
much
higher
than
$4,500,000
it
should
be.
our
expert
did
not
make
a
valuation
in
terms
of
--
this
is
the
figure,
he
said
that
this
is
the
minimum
figure
and
the
reason
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
a
higher
figure
is
because
the
trustee
can't
--
wouldn't
furnish
me
the
information
that's
necessary.
that's
in
the
record
and
i
have
discussed
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
and
placed
into
the
brief
a
number
of
other
passages
in
which
the
trustee
withheld
information
from
a
--
certainly
one
thing
must
be
done
here
by
way
of
remedy.
the
trustee
must
be
instructive.
any
trustee
must
be
instructed
that
it
is
his
duty
to
supply
all
the
information.
another
thing
that
we
need
that
doesn't
require
any
statement,
any
controversy
of
a
fact,
fewer
matter
of
law,
that
there
must
be
a
ruling
and
we
think
that
that
the
ruling
should
be
the
one
that
is
set
out
in
the
sec's
brief
that
defrauders'
stockholders
do
have
a
right
to
claim
as
creditors.
that
question
was
never
ventilated
below
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
erroneously
held
and
we
think
this
is
again
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
we
were
barred
from
raising
the
question
because
of
laches.
we
say
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
of
laches,
that
we
were
too
late
in
filing
our
claim.
we
say
on
that
point
that
laches
under
the
doctrines
of
this
court,
and
we've
cited
the
(inaudible)
case
in
our
brief
that
laches
is
a
question
of
fact
and
that
the
district
judge
has
no
authority
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
make
a
finding
that
we
were
in
laches
until
there'd
been
a
hearing
on
that
question
determining
what
would
the
excuses
for
our
delay,
what
were
the
consequences,
who
was
hurt
by
our
delay
as
well
as
did
we
in
fact
delay.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
bickering
over
facts.
this
is
a
matter
of
acting
on
agreed
facts,
facts
which
are
indisputable
in
the
record.
there
must
also
be,
we
say,
by
way
of
remedy
here,
a
real
review
under
section
221
(5)
which
requires
the
judge
to
look
over
the
whole
cause
of
the
proceedings
and
determine
before
he
approves
the
plan,
before
he
confirms
it
rather,
that
there
has
been
an
independent
trustee.
this
is
not
a
fact
question.
we
think
we
have
developed
the
facts
which
demonstrate
that
this
trustee
had
been
acting
under
conflict
of
interest.
the
question
is
not
whether
he
was
corrupt
but
as
this
court
had
said
whether
he
had
the
opportunity
for
corruption
and
whether
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
position
where
it
can't
be
told,
it
can't
be
determined
what
he
has
done.
it
--
none
of
this
is
a
question
of
fact.
the
trustee,
we
say,
must
go.
it
is
not
important
really
whether
the
trustee
has
the
job
as
president
of
this
company.
what
is
important
is
that
whether
by
a
director's
instruction
in
the
mandate,
unmistakable
language
in
the
opinion,
it
must
be
made
plain
that
the
plan
must
be
vacated
and
that
any
other
plan
by
a
man
who
has
acted
in
conflict
of
interest
will
also
be
vacated.
this
is
a
conclusion
that
we
reached
in
our
brief
when
we
asked
for
relief.
the
sec
which
has
supported
us
throughout
in
this
proceeding
long
before
the
particular
questions
that
mr.
ferber
argued
yesterday
were
raised.
the
sec
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
and
the
conclusion
of
its
--
stated
in
somewhat
differentlanguage.
it
is
our
view
that
all
of
these
things
are
things
that
the
court
can
do,
the
court
can
order
done
in
a
mandate
or
indicate
must
be
done
in
an
opinion.
that's
what's
necessary
to
claim
this
reorganization
now.
i
would
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
some
of
mr.
simmons'
particular
contentions
that
there
was
little
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
there
was
a
dispute
as
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
the
sec
objected
to
its
allowance.
at
roman
ii
1094
of
the
record
that
the
sec
asked
for
a
hearing
on
our
particular
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
it
said
that
after
those
new
specifications
at
large
charging
fraud
were
in
the
record
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
on
it.
finally,
on
this
detailed
points,
it
is
important
just
to
notice
with
respect
to
the
suits,
the
objections
to
the
various
claims,
the
suits
that
were
dropped,
but
what
we're
objecting
to
is
that
although
each
plan
said
that
suits
are
reserved,
all
suits
are
reserved,
all
causes
of
action
reserved
that
the
trustee
did
not
just
make
on
the
advise
of
his
counsel
that
judgment
of
these
were
not
worthy
of
prosecution,
but
that
he
made
a
deal
not
to
prosecute
them;
that
it
was
part
of
the
deal
and
it
was
only
disclosed
in
part
three
years
later
and
another
part
four
years
later.
this
we
say
is
no
way
to
run
a
reorganization.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
think
that
passage
of
it,
your
honor,
is
already
in
the
record.
i
know
it's
in
the
record.
we've
cited
it
in
the
record
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
when
there
was
a
contention
that
everything
was
disclosed
at
the
shaffer-spitzer.
we've
cited
the
passages
in
the
record
in
our
reply
brief.
one
final
point
on
the
law
of
the
case,
mr.
simmons
has
made
again
i
think
in
inadvertent
statement
which
he
said
that
the
plan
was
returned
at
the
time
of
the
second
appeal
only,
and
i'm
quoting
him,
for
determination
of
its
feasibility.
he
is
i
think
quoting
but
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
returned
only
for
determination
of
its
feasibility.
on
the
third
appeal
whether
its
contention
was
made
that
the
law
of
the
case
covered
everything
and
i
quote
from
the
third
appeal
364
f.2d
at
936,
where
the
district
court
said
the
decisions
of
the
appellate
court
sent
the
plan
of
reorganization
back
only
for
determined
feasibility
of
the
plan.
the
fifth
circuit
said
on
the
third
appeal,
“we
do
not
agree
but
hold
that
this
court's
reversal
of
the
order
of
confirmation
left
open
those
issues
not
in
terms
discussed
and
decided”.
the
only
issue
that
was
discussed
and
decided
with
respect
to
us
was
the
matter
or
decided
against
us
was
the
prophylactic
barring
of
the
trustee.
this
is
why
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
exercise
its
supervisory
function
and
why
this
court
has
to
step
in
and
exercise
its
supervisory
function
because
on
each
of
the
first
two
appeals
where
we
had
raised
all
almost
of
these
questions,
although
the
plans
were
set
aside
and
this
is
important,
perhaps
i
didn't
make
this
clear
in
response
to
your
question
yesterday,
mr.
justice
harlan.
on
our
first
appeal
of
claim
was
set
aside
and
our
second
appeal,
the
claim
was
set
aside
but
they
were
set
aside
on
collateral
grounds
which
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
find
necessary
to
consider
the
particular
questions
that
we
had
raised
except
by
indirection
where
it
said
that
the
court
could
act,
the
court
below
on
the
first
appeal
could
act
on
the
findings
ofthe
trustee
had
belatedly
made
with
respect
to
the
shaffer-spitzer
and
could
set
aside
the
first
plan
for
fraud.
this
is
the
reason
why
we've
brought
the
case
here
under
the
supervisory
power
primarily
and
this
is
the
reason
why
we
say
that
there
can
be
a
mandate
and
there
can
be
instructions
and
there
can
be
an
opinion
that
without
going
into
details
bickerings
about
petty
facts
here,
acting
only
on
what
is
claimed
in
the
record
will
clean
up
reorganization
again.
