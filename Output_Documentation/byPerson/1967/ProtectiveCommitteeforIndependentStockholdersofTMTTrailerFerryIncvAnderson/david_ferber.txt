mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
first
discuss
the
question
of
the
trustee
succeeding
himself
as
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
that
the
choice
of
the
person
to
head
up
the
reorganized
corporation
must
be
“consistent
with
public
policy.”
this
is
section
221
of
the
act
which
we
quote
on
page
four
of
our
brief,
if
i
may
just
read
the
applicable
provision.
the
judge
shall
confirm
a
plan
if
satisfied
that
there
are
various
requirements
such
as
if
the
plan
is
fair
and
equitable
and
feasible
and
finally
the
last
requirement
is
that
the
identity,
qualifications
and
affiliations
of
the
persons
who
are
to
be
directors
or
officers
or
voting
trustees
of
any,
upon
the
consummation
of
the
plan
have
been
fully
disclosed
and
that
the
appointment
of
such
persons
to
such
offices
or
their
continuance
therein
is
equitable,
compatible
with
the
interests
of
the
creditors
and
stockholders
and
consistent
with
public
policy.
now,
the
choice
of
the
reorganization
trustee
to
be
president
of
the
reorganized
company
in
our
view
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
policy
of
chapter
10
which
requires
that
the
trustee
be
disinterested,
section
156
of
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
trustee
as
well
as
counsel
for
the
trustee
must
be
disinterested
and
this
is
defined
in
section
158
of
the
act,
disinterested.
it
excludes
specific
persons
such
as
creditors
and
the
debtor,
stockholders
and
the
debtor,
the
underwriter
of
existing
securities
of
the
debtor,
directors,
officers
and
employees
of
the
debtor
and
there
is
a
catch-all
at
the
end
and
this
too
is
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
the
final
provision
which
says
that
a
person
shall
not
be
deemed
disinterested
if
it
appears
that
he
has
by
reason
of
any
other
direct
or
indirect
relation
to
--
relationship
to,
connection
with
or
interest
in
the
debtor
or
such
underwriter
or
for
any
reason
an
interest
materially
adverse
to
interests
of
any
class
or
stockholders.
now
the
importance
--
mr.
david
ferber
we
feel
that
unless
--
mr.
david
ferber
yes
we
feel
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
no
your
honor,
there
have
been
fairly
few
cases
where
this
has
come
up.
we
have
urged
the
position
in
several
district
court
cases,
the
sec
as
you
may
know
although
a
party
to
these
reorganizations
may
not
take
appeals.
mr.
david
ferber
so
far
as
i
am
aware
we
have
that
position
in
various
cases
going
back
at
least
to
the
40s.
i
believe
there
were
cases
in
the
earlier
days
where
the
commission
may
not
have
taken
that
position
and
there
may
have
been
--
i
just
haven't
had
--
been
able
to
survey
them
all,
there
may
have
some
cases
more
recently
where
we
neglected
to.
mr.
david
ferber
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
recall
any,
but
there
could
have
been
some.
i
just
--
in
other
words
i
only
know
appeal
cases
where
this
has
occurred
in
recent
years
and
at
least
in
the
last
few
years
those
cases
where
it
occurred,
we
did
object.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
that
was
the
--
this
was
the
place
we
took
the
position
in,
in
connection
with
objecting
to
the
approval
of
a
plan
if
the
approval
show
that
the
trustee
was
to
be
as
occurred
in
i
believe
in
this
case
and
otherwise
at
the
confirmation.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
the
confirmation
of
the
plan
we
are
saying
and
this
where
we
generally
would
object
in
another
words
when
the
plan
was
submitted
to
us
or
when
we
first
learned
that
it
was
contemplated
that
the
chapter
10
trustee
was
to
be
the
president
of
--
now
this
often
we
come
up
very,
very
late
in
the
proceeding
of
course.
now
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
this
is
important
and
believe
me
we
too
have,
we've
learned
from
experience
and
that's
why
i
think
our
past
action
should
not
certainly
conclude
as
here.
we
think
that
when
we
look
at
the
importance
of
the
requirement
of
the
disinterested
trustee,
which
was
certainly
emphasized
by
the
legislative
history,
the
studies
that
preceded
the
adoption
of
chapter
10
had
shown
case
after
case,
where
those
able
to
manipulate
the
reorganization
proceeding
had
benefited
of
the
expenses
scattered
public
investors
to
a
lack
of
an
independent
trustee.
the
committee
report,
the
house
report
noted
that
the
“functions
of
the
independent
trustee
appointed
in
the
larger
cases
are
difficult
to
over
emphasize”
and
i
continue,
“only
through
an
impartial
trustee
can
the
court
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
an
informed
judgment
and
to
afford
a
critical
scrutiny
and
supervision
of
these
state
at
all
times.”
the
commission's
representative
testified
that
the
reorganization
trustee,
that
requirement
that
he
be
disinterested
was
the
key
to
real
reform.
mr.
david
ferber
exactly.
mr.
david
ferber
it
is
our
position
that
a
man
cannot
continue
to
be
disinterested
once
he
is
angling
for
the
job
of
becoming
president
of
the
reorganized
corporation.
we
don't
know
the
moment
he
cease
to
be
disinterested,
but
we
do
know
that
somewhere
along
the
line
he
has
been
having
conversations.
he
has
been
talking
with
people.
he
may
have
been
taking
actions
to
bring
about
this
result
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
between
wanting
the
fairest
and
best
plan
for
security
holders
and
wanting
a
plan
that
will
make
you
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
the
difficulty
of
proof
of
such
thing
just
impossible.
for
the
outsider
to
be
able
to
disprove
that
this
is
the
way
it
happened.
now
in
this
case
it
epitomizes
the
contracts,
i
mean
the
conflict
that
the
trustee
was
confronted
with
whether
or
not
he
was
an
honest
man.
whether
or
not
in
other
words,
let's
assume
that
he
was
completely
honest.
he
had
choices
to
make,
which
a
man
cannot
make
without
serious
conflict
that's,
we
think
ceases
to
make
disinterested.
for
example
the
charge
here
that
in
the
operation
of
the
business
he
signed
a
sweetheart
contract
with
a
florida
towing
company.
this
was
a
contract
$1,500,000
a
year,
the
biggest
expense
of
the
company.
it's
charged
by
the
committee
that
he
could
have
gotten
the
same
kind
of
contract
for
$100,000
less,
i
don't
know
whether
that
so
or
not,
but
we
do
know
that
florida
towing
corporation
has
a
man
on
the
board
of
directors
and
was
a
very
substantial
creditor
at
the
top.
so
that
here
was
a
conflict
right
in
the
operation
of
the
business
of
not
hurting
or
perhaps
helping
someone
which
you
would
want
to
vote
for
you
to
be
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
the
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
know
the
instances
to
which
you
are
referring
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
believe
your
honor
that
at
least
for
several
years.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
think
at
least
there
are
some
safeguard
in
that
area.
i
believe
for
example
the
general
who
goes
with
the
chairman
of
the
board
the
new
corporation
cannot
appear
before
the
defense
department
at
least
for
several
years
or
with
respect
to
any
matter
as
to
which
he
had
worked
previously.
so
at
least
there
are
some
sorts
of
safeguards,
but
here
i
think
that
the
disinterested
and
this
is
not
just
in
lacking
because
of
the
operations
of
course,
but
even
more
basically
because
of
his
duties
in
bringing
about
a
fair
plan
in
compromising
claims.
for
example
the
compromises
here,
we
don't
say
that
you
have
to
determine
on
this
record
that
the
compromises
were
unfair.
we
think
that
you
can
determine
very
easily
from
this
record
that
the
compromises
were
not
sufficiently
explained
that
the
compromise
of
merrill-stevens
claim
whereby
merrill-stevens
who
received
40%
of
the
stock
of
the
debtor
whereby
they
got
their
entire
claim
paid
in
full
with
an
explanation
of
about
one
paragraph
which
in
effect
said
something
about
well
we
don't
think
they
would
take
less.
mr.
david
ferber
we
don't
know
when
the
trustee
was
approached.
we
don't
know
when
this
began
justice
fortas
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
we
do
know.
mr.
david
ferber
only
when
he
is,
when
its
out
of
–
you
mean
trustee
fees?
mr.
david
ferber
it's
the
serious
problem.
the
congress
did
legislate
and
said
that
the
trustee
must
be
disinterested.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
means
this
be
in
a
position
where
he
does
not
have
serious
conflicts
of
interests
among
the
service
of
the
trust
in
effect
the
security
holders
when
he
is
to
make
the
plans
when
its
up
to
--
mr.
david
ferber
if
this
prophylactic
position
that
we
are
asserting
is
followed
it
will
prevent
such
falls
from
grace.
i
didn't,
haven't
had
a
chance
to
point
out
the
many
important
procedures
that
the
trustee
must
accomplish.
he
is
the
one
who
is
primarily
in
charge
of
putting
together
the
reorganization
plan
and
valuing
the
debt
and
of
taking
positions
as
to
what
claims
he
shall
oppose
and
of
taking
positions
between
perhaps
contesting
plans
in
each
of
these
areas.
in
this
very
case
the
trustee
was
put
into
serious
positions
of
conflict.
for
example,
in
the
early
plan
which
went
through
very
quickly
when
the
trustee
skipped
evaluation
hearing
and
did
not
even
begin
to
investigate
this
caplan
mortgage
claim
and
the
caplan
people
got
control
of
the
reorganized
company
and
he
was
made
president.
now,
assuming
he
had
a
deal
with
those
people
to
be
president
now
naturally
his
interest
was
not
to
delay
the
reorganization
by
going
through
all
these
procedures.
with
respect
to
the
stockholders
here,
they
have
been
litigating
with
the
trustee.
they've
been
making
all
sorts
of
charges
against
him.
presumably
if
they
were
cut
into
this
reorganization,
they
would
not
be
tempted
to
vote
for
him
to
be
its
president.
and
so
that
when
he
is
undervaluing,
if
he
is
undervaluing
the
data
which
will
cut
the
stockholders
out,
here
perhaps
he
didn't
undervalue,
but
it
certainly
there
was
a
conflict.
similarly
when
he
opposed
the
claims
of
these
stockholders,
the
creditor
claims
that
is
the
base
--
the
in
effect
recession
claims
on
the
theory
that
they
purchased
them
on
the
ground
of
fraud
when
he
opposed
it
not
only
on
the
merits
but
procedurally
because
he
claimed
the
claims
were
filed,
well
he
may
have
been
right
but
he
was
certainly
in
the
conflicting
position
to
do
this.
mr.
david
ferber
i
am
not
representing
your
honor
that
the
trustee
in
these
areas
consciously
violated
his
trust.
i
do
think
he
was
derelict
in
his
duties
in
not
having
the
kind
of
hearings
that
the
act
contemplates
in
making
compromises
without
bringing
them
out
into
the
open
and
then
not
affording
the
procedures
which
chapter
x
requires.
mr.
david
ferber
no.
mr.
david
ferber
three
and
this
--
and
compromised.
i
really
don't
know
your
honor,
there
were
never
a
panel
of
more
than
three.
i
should
correct
perhaps
--
mr.
david
ferber
no,
i
should
correct
a
misunderstanding
i
think
that
mr.
langbein
did
misunderstand
your
earlier
question,
there
were
three
appeals
that
his
committee
was
in
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
reorganization.
there
had
been
two
other
appeals
by
the
caplan
group
attempting
to
let
it
stay.
so
coming
back
but
those
first
two
appeals
didn't
delay
this
proceeding
if
anything
they
probably
hastened
it
along
because
it
was
refusing
to
let
them
foreclose
on
the
mortgage.
my
time
is
almost
up.
i
think
i'll
have
to
rely
on
our
briefs
for
our
other
points.
i
would
like
merely
to
conclude
by
saying
that
we
think
in
this
case
that
they
were
omitted
a
substantial
number
of
the
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
the
public
that
chapter
x
was
designed
to
provide.
some
of
the
disinterested
trustee
i
have
discussed,
the
others
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
while
everyone
is
anxious
to
get
this
case
finally
over
with,
this
court
through
justice
stone,
many
years
ago
in
one
of
the
first
chapter
x
cases,
first
cases
to
reach
this
court
pointed
out
they're
indicated
that
in
chapter
x,
the
safeguards
for
public
investors
are
not
to
be
sacrificed
for
speed
and
conflict.
mr.
david
ferber
we
have
no
authority
to
promulgate
a
regulation.
we
did
ask
congress
several
years
ago
to
adopt
legislation
along
this
line.
i
don't
even
know
whether
the
bill,
i
think
the
bill
got
introduced
but
it
never
got
to
the
hearing
stage.
mr.
david
ferber
never
got
to
the
hearing
stage
into
the
core
committee.
it
sort
of,
i
think
believe
it
died
shortly
after
it
was
introduced
and
we've
never
reintroduced
it.
mr.
david
ferber
that
bill
would
have
provided
that
--
would
have
put
a
two
year
period
after
the
conclusion
of
reorganization
before
a
trustee
of
the
reorganization
could
be
a
president
or
i
believe
any
other
executive
officer
of
a
corporation.
mr.
david
ferber
with
this,
the
rule
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
adopt
here
is
really
that
no
plan
can
be
confirmed
where
it
is
proposed
that
the
trustee
will
be
president
of
the
new
company
and
it
comes
up
on
the
conformation.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
lay
down
such
a
rule
and
then
let's
say
the
initial,
the
board
of
directors
held
a
meeting
three
weeks
later
and
threw
out
the
president
and
elected
a
new
president,
i
think
we
would
say
that
was
probably
the
fraud
on
the
court
and
that
it
would
appear
on
the
phase
of
it
to
be
absent,
very
exceptional
circumstances
such
as
that
the
interim
trustee
had
died
or
control
have
changed
hands
or
something
of
that
sort
but
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
work
it
out,
the
courts
would
have
to
work
it
out
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
that
we
certainly
think
if
we,
if
you
agree
with
us
i
think
you
would
also
consistently
agree
that
the
plan
hearings
must
be
re-had
and
these
compromises
--
mr.
david
ferber
because
it
seems
to
me
that
this
conflict
permeates
everything
that
is
going
on.
how
can
the
trustee
who
would
settles
these
--
mr.
david
ferber
well
perhaps
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
prospectively
at
any
given
point
of
time
certainly
before
we
knew
the
trustee
was
contemplating
being
president.
we
could
show
at
that
time
that
here
is
a
man
who
is
working
toward
a
particular
end
of
getting
himself
to
be
president.
mr.
david
ferber
oh
no,
very
much
no
sir.
mr.
david
ferber
this
maybe
what
should
follow,
but
not
necessarily.
if
it
becomes
clear
that
the
trustee
cannot
become
president
then
at
least
the
conflict
that
we
are
complaining
about
would
not
be
there
for
future
plan
hearings
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
possible
of
course
that
by
reason
of
the
recriminations
and
litigation
it
might
be
that
the
committee
or
the
commission
might
consider
a
motion
to
remove
him
at
that
time,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
issues
are
necessarily
at
all
the
same.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right.
mr.
david
ferber
well
it
has
to
go
back
most
of
the
way,
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
well
i
mean
--
mr.
david
ferber
no
in
many
things
there
has
been
no
argument
about,
many
claimants,
no
one
dispute
of
them.
the
essential
things
that
there
have
been
issues
are
with
respect
to
are;
one
the
valuation
of
this
company,
should
the
stockholders
be
cut
in.
two,
the
two
large
compromises
of
the
two
major
creditors.
three,

or
not

mr.
david
ferber
we
are
sure
he
had
been
president
with
an
earlier
group,
now
whether
during
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
right.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right,
conceivably
he
could
have
at
this
time
given
up
his
idea
of
being
president.
mr.
david
ferber
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
certainly
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
first
discuss
the
question
of
the
trustee
succeeding
himself
as
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
that
the
choice
of
the
person
to
head
up
the
reorganized
corporation
must
be
“consistent
with
public
policy.”
this
is
section
221
of
the
act
which
we
quote
on
page
four
of
our
brief,
if
i
may
just
read
the
applicable
provision.
the
judge
shall
confirm
a
plan
if
satisfied
that
there
are
various
requirements
such
as
if
the
plan
is
fair
and
equitable
and
feasible
and
finally
the
last
requirement
is
that
the
identity,
qualifications
and
affiliations
of
the
persons
who
are
to
be
directors
or
officers
or
voting
trustees
of
any,
upon
the
consummation
of
the
plan
have
been
fully
disclosed
and
that
the
appointment
of
such
persons
to
such
offices
or
their
continuance
therein
is
equitable,
compatible
with
the
interests
of
the
creditors
and
stockholders
and
consistent
with
public
policy.
now,
the
choice
of
the
reorganization
trustee
to
be
president
of
the
reorganized
company
in
our
view
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
policy
of
chapter
10
which
requires
that
the
trustee
be
disinterested,
section
156
of
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
trustee
as
well
as
counsel
for
the
trustee
must
be
disinterested
and
this
is
defined
in
section
158
of
the
act,
disinterested.
it
excludes
specific
persons
such
as
creditors
and
the
debtor,
stockholders
and
the
debtor,
the
underwriter
of
existing
securities
of
the
debtor,
directors,
officers
and
employees
of
the
debtor
and
there
is
a
catch-all
at
the
end
and
this
too
is
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
the
final
provision
which
says
that
a
person
shall
not
be
deemed
disinterested
if
it
appears
that
he
has
by
reason
of
any
other
direct
or
indirect
relation
to
--
relationship
to,
connection
with
or
interest
in
the
debtor
or
such
underwriter
or
for
any
reason
an
interest
materially
adverse
to
interests
of
any
class
or
stockholders.
now
the
importance
--
mr.
david
ferber
we
feel
that
unless
--
mr.
david
ferber
yes
we
feel
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
no
your
honor,
there
have
been
fairly
few
cases
where
this
has
come
up.
we
have
urged
the
position
in
several
district
court
cases,
the
sec
as
you
may
know
although
a
party
to
these
reorganizations
may
not
take
appeals.
mr.
david
ferber
so
far
as
i
am
aware
we
have
that
position
in
various
cases
going
back
at
least
to
the
40s.
i
believe
there
were
cases
in
the
earlier
days
where
the
commission
may
not
have
taken
that
position
and
there
may
have
been
--
i
just
haven't
had
--
been
able
to
survey
them
all,
there
may
have
some
cases
more
recently
where
we
neglected
to.
mr.
david
ferber
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
recall
any,
but
there
could
have
been
some.
i
just
--
in
other
words
i
only
know
appeal
cases
where
this
has
occurred
in
recent
years
and
at
least
in
the
last
few
years
those
cases
where
it
occurred,
we
did
object.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
that
was
the
--
this
was
the
place
we
took
the
position
in,
in
connection
with
objecting
to
the
approval
of
a
plan
if
the
approval
show
that
the
trustee
was
to
be
as
occurred
in
i
believe
in
this
case
and
otherwise
at
the
confirmation.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
the
confirmation
of
the
plan
we
are
saying
and
this
where
we
generally
would
object
in
another
words
when
the
plan
was
submitted
to
us
or
when
we
first
learned
that
it
was
contemplated
that
the
chapter
10
trustee
was
to
be
the
president
of
--
now
this
often
we
come
up
very,
very
late
in
the
proceeding
of
course.
now
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
this
is
important
and
believe
me
we
too
have,
we've
learned
from
experience
and
that's
why
i
think
our
past
action
should
not
certainly
conclude
as
here.
we
think
that
when
we
look
at
the
importance
of
the
requirement
of
the
disinterested
trustee,
which
was
certainly
emphasized
by
the
legislative
history,
the
studies
that
preceded
the
adoption
of
chapter
10
had
shown
case
after
case,
where
those
able
to
manipulate
the
reorganization
proceeding
had
benefited
of
the
expenses
scattered
public
investors
to
a
lack
of
an
independent
trustee.
the
committee
report,
the
house
report
noted
that
the
“functions
of
the
independent
trustee
appointed
in
the
larger
cases
are
difficult
to
over
emphasize”
and
i
continue,
“only
through
an
impartial
trustee
can
the
court
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
an
informed
judgment
and
to
afford
a
critical
scrutiny
and
supervision
of
these
state
at
all
times.”
the
commission's
representative
testified
that
the
reorganization
trustee,
that
requirement
that
he
be
disinterested
was
the
key
to
real
reform.
mr.
david
ferber
exactly.
mr.
david
ferber
it
is
our
position
that
a
man
cannot
continue
to
be
disinterested
once
he
is
angling
for
the
job
of
becoming
president
of
the
reorganized
corporation.
we
don't
know
the
moment
he
cease
to
be
disinterested,
but
we
do
know
that
somewhere
along
the
line
he
has
been
having
conversations.
he
has
been
talking
with
people.
he
may
have
been
taking
actions
to
bring
about
this
result
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
between
wanting
the
fairest
and
best
plan
for
security
holders
and
wanting
a
plan
that
will
make
you
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
the
difficulty
of
proof
of
such
thing
just
impossible.
for
the
outsider
to
be
able
to
disprove
that
this
is
the
way
it
happened.
now
in
this
case
it
epitomizes
the
contracts,
i
mean
the
conflict
that
the
trustee
was
confronted
with
whether
or
not
he
was
an
honest
man.
whether
or
not
in
other
words,
let's
assume
that
he
was
completely
honest.
he
had
choices
to
make,
which
a
man
cannot
make
without
serious
conflict
that's,
we
think
ceases
to
make
disinterested.
for
example
the
charge
here
that
in
the
operation
of
the
business
he
signed
a
sweetheart
contract
with
a
florida
towing
company.
this
was
a
contract
$1,500,000
a
year,
the
biggest
expense
of
the
company.
it's
charged
by
the
committee
that
he
could
have
gotten
the
same
kind
of
contract
for
$100,000
less,
i
don't
know
whether
that
so
or
not,
but
we
do
know
that
florida
towing
corporation
has
a
man
on
the
board
of
directors
and
was
a
very
substantial
creditor
at
the
top.
so
that
here
was
a
conflict
right
in
the
operation
of
the
business
of
not
hurting
or
perhaps
helping
someone
which
you
would
want
to
vote
for
you
to
be
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
the
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
know
the
instances
to
which
you
are
referring
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
believe
your
honor
that
at
least
for
several
years.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
think
at
least
there
are
some
safeguard
in
that
area.
i
believe
for
example
the
general
who
goes
with
the
chairman
of
the
board
the
new
corporation
cannot
appear
before
the
defense
department
at
least
for
several
years
or
with
respect
to
any
matter
as
to
which
he
had
worked
previously.
so
at
least
there
are
some
sorts
of
safeguards,
but
here
i
think
that
the
disinterested
and
this
is
not
just
in
lacking
because
of
the
operations
of
course,
but
even
more
basically
because
of
his
duties
in
bringing
about
a
fair
plan
in
compromising
claims.
for
example
the
compromises
here,
we
don't
say
that
you
have
to
determine
on
this
record
that
the
compromises
were
unfair.
we
think
that
you
can
determine
very
easily
from
this
record
that
the
compromises
were
not
sufficiently
explained
that
the
compromise
of
merrill-stevens
claim
whereby
merrill-stevens
who
received
40%
of
the
stock
of
the
debtor
whereby
they
got
their
entire
claim
paid
in
full
with
an
explanation
of
about
one
paragraph
which
in
effect
said
something
about
well
we
don't
think
they
would
take
less.
mr.
david
ferber
we
don't
know
when
the
trustee
was
approached.
we
don't
know
when
this
began
justice
fortas
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
we
do
know.
mr.
david
ferber
only
when
he
is,
when
its
out
of
–
you
mean
trustee
fees?
mr.
david
ferber
it's
the
serious
problem.
the
congress
did
legislate
and
said
that
the
trustee
must
be
disinterested.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
means
this
be
in
a
position
where
he
does
not
have
serious
conflicts
of
interests
among
the
service
of
the
trust
in
effect
the
security
holders
when
he
is
to
make
the
plans
when
its
up
to
--
mr.
david
ferber
if
this
prophylactic
position
that
we
are
asserting
is
followed
it
will
prevent
such
falls
from
grace.
i
didn't,
haven't
had
a
chance
to
point
out
the
many
important
procedures
that
the
trustee
must
accomplish.
he
is
the
one
who
is
primarily
in
charge
of
putting
together
the
reorganization
plan
and
valuing
the
debt
and
of
taking
positions
as
to
what
claims
he
shall
oppose
and
of
taking
positions
between
perhaps
contesting
plans
in
each
of
these
areas.
in
this
very
case
the
trustee
was
put
into
serious
positions
of
conflict.
for
example,
in
the
early
plan
which
went
through
very
quickly
when
the
trustee
skipped
evaluation
hearing
and
did
not
even
begin
to
investigate
this
caplan
mortgage
claim
and
the
caplan
people
got
control
of
the
reorganized
company
and
he
was
made
president.
now,
assuming
he
had
a
deal
with
those
people
to
be
president
now
naturally
his
interest
was
not
to
delay
the
reorganization
by
going
through
all
these
procedures.
with
respect
to
the
stockholders
here,
they
have
been
litigating
with
the
trustee.
they've
been
making
all
sorts
of
charges
against
him.
presumably
if
they
were
cut
into
this
reorganization,
they
would
not
be
tempted
to
vote
for
him
to
be
its
president.
and
so
that
when
he
is
undervaluing,
if
he
is
undervaluing
the
data
which
will
cut
the
stockholders
out,
here
perhaps
he
didn't
undervalue,
but
it
certainly
there
was
a
conflict.
similarly
when
he
opposed
the
claims
of
these
stockholders,
the
creditor
claims
that
is
the
base
--
the
in
effect
recession
claims
on
the
theory
that
they
purchased
them
on
the
ground
of
fraud
when
he
opposed
it
not
only
on
the
merits
but
procedurally
because
he
claimed
the
claims
were
filed,
well
he
may
have
been
right
but
he
was
certainly
in
the
conflicting
position
to
do
this.
mr.
david
ferber
i
am
not
representing
your
honor
that
the
trustee
in
these
areas
consciously
violated
his
trust.
i
do
think
he
was
derelict
in
his
duties
in
not
having
the
kind
of
hearings
that
the
act
contemplates
in
making
compromises
without
bringing
them
out
into
the
open
and
then
not
affording
the
procedures
which
chapter
x
requires.
mr.
david
ferber
no.
mr.
david
ferber
three
and
this
--
and
compromised.
i
really
don't
know
your
honor,
there
were
never
a
panel
of
more
than
three.
i
should
correct
perhaps
--
mr.
david
ferber
no,
i
should
correct
a
misunderstanding
i
think
that
mr.
langbein
did
misunderstand
your
earlier
question,
there
were
three
appeals
that
his
committee
was
in
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
reorganization.
there
had
been
two
other
appeals
by
the
caplan
group
attempting
to
let
it
stay.
so
coming
back
but
those
first
two
appeals
didn't
delay
this
proceeding
if
anything
they
probably
hastened
it
along
because
it
was
refusing
to
let
them
foreclose
on
the
mortgage.
my
time
is
almost
up.
i
think
i'll
have
to
rely
on
our
briefs
for
our
other
points.
i
would
like
merely
to
conclude
by
saying
that
we
think
in
this
case
that
they
were
omitted
a
substantial
number
of
the
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
the
public
that
chapter
x
was
designed
to
provide.
some
of
the
disinterested
trustee
i
have
discussed,
the
others
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
while
everyone
is
anxious
to
get
this
case
finally
over
with,
this
court
through
justice
stone,
many
years
ago
in
one
of
the
first
chapter
x
cases,
first
cases
to
reach
this
court
pointed
out
they're
indicated
that
in
chapter
x,
the
safeguards
for
public
investors
are
not
to
be
sacrificed
for
speed
and
conflict.
mr.
david
ferber
we
have
no
authority
to
promulgate
a
regulation.
we
did
ask
congress
several
years
ago
to
adopt
legislation
along
this
line.
i
don't
even
know
whether
the
bill,
i
think
the
bill
got
introduced
but
it
never
got
to
the
hearing
stage.
mr.
david
ferber
never
got
to
the
hearing
stage
into
the
core
committee.
it
sort
of,
i
think
believe
it
died
shortly
after
it
was
introduced
and
we've
never
reintroduced
it.
mr.
david
ferber
that
bill
would
have
provided
that
--
would
have
put
a
two
year
period
after
the
conclusion
of
reorganization
before
a
trustee
of
the
reorganization
could
be
a
president
or
i
believe
any
other
executive
officer
of
a
corporation.
mr.
david
ferber
with
this,
the
rule
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
adopt
here
is
really
that
no
plan
can
be
confirmed
where
it
is
proposed
that
the
trustee
will
be
president
of
the
new
company
and
it
comes
up
on
the
conformation.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
lay
down
such
a
rule
and
then
let's
say
the
initial,
the
board
of
directors
held
a
meeting
three
weeks
later
and
threw
out
the
president
and
elected
a
new
president,
i
think
we
would
say
that
was
probably
the
fraud
on
the
court
and
that
it
would
appear
on
the
phase
of
it
to
be
absent,
very
exceptional
circumstances
such
as
that
the
interim
trustee
had
died
or
control
have
changed
hands
or
something
of
that
sort
but
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
work
it
out,
the
courts
would
have
to
work
it
out
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
that
we
certainly
think
if
we,
if
you
agree
with
us
i
think
you
would
also
consistently
agree
that
the
plan
hearings
must
be
re-had
and
these
compromises
--
mr.
david
ferber
because
it
seems
to
me
that
this
conflict
permeates
everything
that
is
going
on.
how
can
the
trustee
who
would
settles
these
--
mr.
david
ferber
well
perhaps
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
prospectively
at
any
given
point
of
time
certainly
before
we
knew
the
trustee
was
contemplating
being
president.
we
could
show
at
that
time
that
here
is
a
man
who
is
working
toward
a
particular
end
of
getting
himself
to
be
president.
mr.
david
ferber
oh
no,
very
much
no
sir.
mr.
david
ferber
this
maybe
what
should
follow,
but
not
necessarily.
if
it
becomes
clear
that
the
trustee
cannot
become
president
then
at
least
the
conflict
that
we
are
complaining
about
would
not
be
there
for
future
plan
hearings
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
possible
of
course
that
by
reason
of
the
recriminations
and
litigation
it
might
be
that
the
committee
or
the
commission
might
consider
a
motion
to
remove
him
at
that
time,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
issues
are
necessarily
at
all
the
same.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right.
mr.
david
ferber
well
it
has
to
go
back
most
of
the
way,
yes.
mr.
david
ferber
well
i
mean
--
mr.
david
ferber
no
in
many
things
there
has
been
no
argument
about,
many
claimants,
no
one
dispute
of
them.
the
essential
things
that
there
have
been
issues
are
with
respect
to
are;
one
the
valuation
of
this
company,
should
the
stockholders
be
cut
in.
two,
the
two
large
compromises
of
the
two
major
creditors.
three,
whether
or
not
the
stockholders
have
a
claim
based
upon
the
fraud
in
the
sale
of
their
stock.
mr.
david
ferber
we
are
sure
he
had
been
president
with
an
earlier
group,
now
whether
during
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
right.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right,
conceivably
he
could
have
at
this
time
given
up
his
idea
of
being
president.
mr.
david
ferber
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
certainly
would
not
your
honor.
