mr.
m.
james
spitzer
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
perhaps
a
searing
emotional
experience
to
sit
at
the
counsel
table
of
this
court
and
because
one
is
an
(inaudible)
trustee
to
find
oneself
receiving
the
phrasal
and
invective
employed
yesterday.
i
suppose
if
one
could
be
objective
about
it,
would
be
alleviated
by
knowing
that
everybody
else
connected
with
this
proceeding
whether
it
be
the
trustee,
its
counsel,
the
creditors,
even
to
some
extent,
the
district
court
and
even
some
members
of
the
panel
of
the
--
the
panels
that
sat
in
the
fifth
court
of
appeals
are
included.
perhaps
it
mitigates,
it
doesn't
eliminate
it.
and
if
there's
any
emotion
in
my
argument,
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me.
i
appear
solely
on
behalf
of
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
your
honors
will
find
in
the
briefs
which
is
so
highly
critical,
there
isn't
a
word
as
to
the
nature
of
those
claims,
of
that
claim.
some
$330,000
and
fresh
new
money,
it
was
paid
for
a
note
in
that
amount
secured
by
two
mortgages
for
plainly
disclosed
investors
and
for
shares
of
stock
having
a
described
value
of
$49,500.
a
little
over
two-thirds
of
that
money
was
immediately
on
the
direction
of
the
data
transmitted
to
the
(inaudible)
national
bank
to
pay
for
an
installment
of
interest
in
principal
on
a
maritime
mortgage
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
maritime
administration
and
thereby
redounded
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
by
reducing
its
liability.
the
greater
part
of
the
balance
was
used
to
clear
liens
and
libels
on
other
vessels
to
which
it
would
now
be
subject.
the
claim
presently
would
be
something
substantially,
substantially
in
excess
of
a
half
million
dollars
with
interest
at
a
6%
rate
provided
for
in
the
note.
this
has
been
settled
for
the
sum
of
$250,000
with
the
interest
subordinated
to
that
of
a
general
claim
with
no
voice
whatsoever
in
the
reorganized
corporation,
except
as
a
minority
stockholder
having
roughly
3%
of
the
outstanding
stock.
let
me
it
very
plain
irrespective
of
what
the
brief
say.
the
plan
is
clear,
the
record
is
clear.
we
never
sought,
we
never
obtained
and
there
has
been
no
disposition
of
any
claims
against
any
participant.
i
appear
here
solely
on
behalf
of
the
trustees.
if
the
data
or
state
desires
to
sue
any
individual
participant,
we
have
never
blocked
it.
i
want
to
be
also
clear
on
one
thing.
the
position
of
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees
from
the
inception
has
been
plain.
we
immediately
filed
a
claim.
we
made
opposition
claim,
we
said
we
were
first
mortgagees,
subject
and
subordinate
to
no
claims.
for
two
and
a
half
years,
neither
petitioner
nor
the
sec
filed
any
objections
whatsoever
to
our
client.
a
plan
of
reorganization
was
promulgated
which
incorporated
a
compromise,
not
at
our
request.
we
have
never
once
requested
any
compromise
on
our
claim.
we
have
manfully
stood
up
and
taken
our
position
and
read
--
and
been
ready
to
defend
it.
it
was
only
after
we
petitioned
for
a
leave
to
foreclose.
when
it
was
denied
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
remanded
and
directed
that
we
be
satisfied.
when
the
court
referred
it
to
a
special
master,
we
took
a
second
appeal.
and
during
the
pendency
of
that
appeal,
the
trustee
and
the
creditors
requested
that
we
compromise.
we
were
prepared
to
accept
the
compromise
or
litigate.
the
matter
was
incorporated
in
a
plan
of
reorganization
which
was
approved
and
confirmed
and
let
me
make
it
plain.
there
was
no
objection
of
any
kind
to
our
claim
at
this
point
by
anyone.
when
the
plan
was
ready
to
be
consummated,
the
sec
requested
an
investigation
of
our
claim.
we
immediately
consented
in
any
form,
manner
or
shape
that
was
sought.
there
was
an
investigation
that
took
place
from
january
29
to
may
4,
1960.
it
was
conducted
by
the
reorganization
and
trustee
and
his
counsel
and
by
four
members
of
the
staff
of
the
sec,
two
of
their
attorneys
and
two
of
their
investigators.
there
was
some
33
persons
interrogated.
there
was
some
2200
pages
of
testimony
transcribed.
there
was
some
60
exhibits
that
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
while
we
flatly
disagreed
with
the
conclusion
of
the
reorganization
trustee,
at
least
he
was
fair
enough
to
say
that
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees
and
the
participants
gave
every
possible
cooperation,
we
testified
everything
that
was
asked
for,
we
produced
every
record
that
was
sought.
may
i
say
to
your
honors
that
when
the
court
originally
passed
upon
the
plan
of
reorganization
incorporating
our
compromise
of
our
claim
it
had
before
it
everything
that
the
combined
and
cumulative
efforts
of
counsel
for
the
trustee,
counsel
for
the
sec,
counsel
for
the
creditors
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
could
bring
before
the
court.
now
in
one
respect,
i
see
i
have
only
five
minutes
and
i'd
hope
i'd
have
more.
in
one
respect
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
simmons
with
respect
to
our
claim.
the
charges
of
fraud
whenever
refuted
as
what
stated
yesterday,
we
filed
a
claim,
there
was
no
objection
filed.
now,
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
transpired
and
there
--
what
hearings
with
respect
to
our
claim
before
the
court.
on
april
24th,
1962,
after
the
plan
was
--
the
present
plan
was
prepared,
eight
days
before
it
was
submitted
for
approval,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
interrogated
the
trustee
with
respect
to
outstanding
litigation
and
claims
that
would
be
litigated
and
it
went
into
causes
of
action,
patent
claims,
the
wilmington
transaction
and
merrill-stevens.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
not
one
question
was
propounded
with
respect
to
any
defense
to
our
claim
or
to
any
claims
against
our
participants.
eight
days
later,
the
plan
came
up
for
approval.
again,
petitioner's
counsel
interrogated.
there
wasn't
again
one
question
asked
with
respect
to
our
claim
and
this
was
when
it
was
before
the
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
sec
on
the
approval,
the
sec's
counsel
questioned
the
trustee
as
to
what
were
his
reasons
for
approving
this
compromised
provision.
the
court
stated
that
it
had
a
jury
waiting
to
come
in,
it
had
another
case
ready
for
the
afternoon.
and
if
there
was
time
desired
to
review
this
matter,
it
would
set
the
matter
down
for
another
day.
at
this
point,
sec
counsel
stated
and
i
quote
from
record
2,
page
283,
“speaking
for
my
self
your
honor,
i
have
concluded”.
now
it
is
asserted
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
imply
that
they
were
satisfied.
i
make
no
implication.
satisfied
or
not,
they
had
the
opportunity.
they
were
requested
by
the
court,
“if
you
want
this
matter
set
down
for
a
day
certain,
we
will
do
it”
but
they
didn't
want
it.
what
they
wanted
really
was
and
they
then
requested
the
trustee
of
state,
how
did
they
arrive
at
the
compromise
which
he
stated.
the
court
then
submitted
a
memorandum
at
a
later
date
that
there
was
insufficient
on
the
record
of
proof.this
was
not
the
end
of
it.
this
was
in
1962.
the
matter
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
at
that
time,
the
counsel
for
the
trustee
set
forth
the
various
reasons
for
the
compromise
of
our
claim.
there
was
a
reversal,
as
your
honors
know,
because
of
the
priority
status
of
the
government's
nontax
claims.
when
the
matter
was
remanded
and
came
before
the
court
again,
on
november
4th,
1964
sec
counsel
inquired
as
to
the
general
manager
whether
any
attempt
had
been
made
to
negotiate
a
more
favorable
settlement.
it
was
answered.
no
effort
whatsoever
was
made
to
impugn
the
settlement.
they
disagree
with
the
reasons
for
the
settlement
to
request
us
to
appear
and
testify
and
we've
been
ready
on
any
and
every
occasion
or
to
produce
any
testimony
whatsoever.
there
was
a
further
hearing
on
january
19th,
1965
where
sec
counsel
inquired
the
reorganization
trustee's
counsel
as
to
the
status
of
litigation
even
with
respect
to
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
again,
there
was
no
request
for
any
interrogation,
any
criticism
whatsoever
with
respect
to
this
compromised
provision.
and
during
all
these
period,
petitioner's
counsel
which
portrays
itself
fulfilling
such
a
heroic
role
in
uncovering
all
these
matters
stood
there
silent
(inaudible).
no
interrogation,
no
inquiry
whatsoever.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
the
contention
that
this
record
is
inadequate
or
that
the
district
court
acted
improvidently
with
respect
to
our
claim
and
i
am
here
only
on
behalf
of
our
claim
is
absolutely
incorrect.
and
may
i
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
united
states
government,
which
is
the
--
one
of
the
largest
creditors,
has
not
objected
to
this
provision.
and
may
i
also
add
one
further
thing
with
respect
to
the
government.
in
1959,
the
united
states
department
of
justice,
at
a
hearing
before
the
court,
set
forth
on
the
record
that
it
had
made
an
investigation
of
our
claim
that
it
had
interrogated
our
representatives.
with
our
consent
had
gone
through
all
books,
records
and
documents
and
were
thoroughly
satisfied
with
respect
to
this
claim.
i
know
that
i
can't
go
further
that
i
had
wanted
to
present
certain
--
the
aspect
of
the
two,
your
honors.
i
merely
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
we
are
in
this
position
at
this
time.
we
have
compromised
twice,
thinking
that
we
had
eliminated
the
problem,
apparently
we
haven't.
we
have
surrendered
our
mortgages
at
the
direction
of
the
district
court.
we
no
longer
even
have
those.
our
property
is
now
subject
and
subordinate
to
a
mortgage
that
was
issued
to
fulfill
and
consummate
this
plan
of
reorganization
to
that
mortgage.
neither
the
sec
nor
the
petitioner
objected.
we
are
afforded
in
an
absolutely
untenable
position
as
a
result
of
no
efforts
on
our
part.
we
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
this
situation
today.
we
have
been
prepared
to
substantiate
our
position.
we
have
filed
our
claim.
we
have
been
ready
to
fight
and
we
have
never
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
it
would
seem
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
as
a
mater
of
fundamental
equity
here,
our
position
should
be
preserved.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
we
cannot
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
matter,
at
least
with
respect
to
our
claim
having
been
compromised
and
the
adjusted
therefore
full
and
complete
and
adequate
hearings
in
the
record,
that
compromise
should
stand.
we
cannot
at
this
point
be
restored
to
our
position.
our
mortgages
cannot
be
reinstated
because
that
may
now
be
intervening
equities,
which
no
court
i
think
that
it
could
eliminate.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
and
it
seems
to
me
irrespective
of
what
may
have
and
i
don't
know
what
happened
or
what
the
court's
position
will
be
but
we
should
be
preserved
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
compromise
which
we
have
in
good
faith
carried
out.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
you're
the
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
i
am
not.
i'm
not
(inaudible)
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
this
is
the
first
laugh
i've
gotten
out
of
this
proceeding
so
forgive
me.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
admonish
this
court.
i
do
believe
that
under
section
27,
there
has
been
a
compromise
made.
it
has
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
and
if
other
provisions
of
the
plan
do
not
stand,
this
compromise
should
be
honored
and
respected
and
at
least
built
in
within
any
type
of
agreement.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir
and
we
are
holding
the
money.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
except
your
honor
please,
if
i
may
intrude.
what
do
we
do
to
preserve
our
situation
in
enforcing
it
in
any
subsequent
proceeding?
we
no
longer
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
--
have
our
mortgages
and
they've
been
satisfied
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
--
and
they're
probably
has
been
subordinated.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
so
how
can
we
preserve
our
position
in
any
further
proceedings?
we
are
at
this
point
not
in
the
position
where
we
can
assert
the
lien
claim
that
we
had.
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
the
power
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
restore
it
now.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
we
have
$250,000,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir.
we
compromise
it
and
we're
prepared
to
stand
on
that
compromise.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
i'd
like
to
know
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
in
violation
of
any
order
of
a
court.
i'll
be
subjected
to
further
proceeding.
yes,
sir,
this
is
also
important
to
us.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
perhaps
a
searing
emotional
experience
to
sit
at
the
counsel
table
of
this
court
and
because
one
is
an
(inaudible)
trustee
to
find
oneself
receiving
the
phrasal
and
invective
employed
yesterday.
i
suppose
if
one
could
be
objective
about
it,
would
be
alleviated
by
knowing
that
everybody
else
connected
with
this
proceeding
whether
it
be
the
trustee,
its
counsel,
the
creditors,
even
to
some
extent,
the
district
court
and
even
some
members
of
the
panel
of
the
--
the
panels
that
sat
in
the
fifth
court
of
appeals
are
included.
perhaps
it
mitigates,
it
doesn't
eliminate
it.
and
if
there's
any
emotion
in
my
argument,
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me.
i
appear
solely
on
behalf
of
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
your
honors
will
find
in
the
briefs
which
is
so
highly
critical,
there
isn't
a
word
as
to
the
nature
of
those
claims,
of
that
claim.
some
$330,000
and
fresh
new
money,
it
was
paid
for
a
note
in
that
amount
secured
by
two
mortgages
for
plainly
disclosed
investors
and
for
shares
of
stock
having
a
described
value
of
$49,500.
a
little
over
two-thirds
of
that
money
was
immediately
on
the
direction
of
the
data
transmitted
to
the
(inaudible)
national
bank
to
pay
for
an
installment
of
interest
in
principal
on
a
maritime
mortgage
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
maritime
administration
and
thereby
redounded
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
by
reducing
its
liability.
the
greater
part
of
the
balance
was
used
to
clear
liens
and
libels
on
other
vessels
to
which
it
would
now
be
subject.
the
claim
presently
would
be
something
substantially,
substantially
in
excess
of
a
half
million
dollars
with
interest
at
a
6%
rate
provided
for
in
the
note.
this
has
been
settled
for
the
sum
of
$250,000
with
the
interest
subordinated
to
that
of
a
general
claim
with
no
voice
whatsoever
in
the
reorganized
corporation,
except
as
a
minority
stockholder
having
roughly
3%
of
the
outstanding
stock.
let
me
it
very
plain
irrespective
of
what
the
brief
say.
the
plan
is
clear,
the
record
is
clear.
we
never
sought,
we
never
obtained
and
there
has
been
no
disposition
of
any
claims
against
any
participant.
i
appear
here
solely
on
behalf
of
the
trustees.
if
the
data
or
state
desires
to
sue
any
individual
participant,
we
have
never
blocked
it.
i
want
to
be
also
clear
on
one
thing.
the
position
of
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees
from
the
inception
has
been
plain.
we
immediately
filed
a
claim.
we
made
opposition
claim,
we
said
we
were
first
mortgagees,
subject
and
subordinate
to
no
claims.
for
two
and
a
half
years,
neither
petitioner
nor
the
sec
filed
any
objections
whatsoever
to
our
client.
a
plan
of
reorganization
was
promulgated
which
incorporated
a
compromise,
not
at
our
request.
we
have
never
once
requested
any
compromise
on
our
claim.
we
have
manfully
stood
up
and
taken
our
position
and
read
--
and
been
ready
to
defend
it.
it
was
only
after
we
petitioned
for
a
leave
to
foreclose.
when
it
was
denied
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
remanded
and
directed
that
we
be
satisfied.
when
the
court
referred
it
to
a
special
master,
we
took
a
second
appeal.
and
during
the
pendency
of
that
appeal,
the
trustee
and
the
creditors
requested
that
we
compromise.
we
were
prepared
to
accept
the
compromise
or
litigate.
the
matter
was
incorporated
in
a
plan
of
reorganization
which
was
approved
and
confirmed
and
let
me
make
it
plain.
there
was
no
objection
of
any
kind
to
our
claim
at
this
point
by
anyone.
when
the
plan
was
ready
to
be
consummated,
the
sec
requested
an
investigation
of
our
claim.
we
immediately
consented
in
any
form,
manner
or
shape
that
was
sought.
there
was
an
investigation
that
took
place
from
january
29
to
may
4,
1960.
it
was
conducted
by
the
reorganization
and
trustee
and
his
counsel
and
by
four
members
of
the
staff
of
the
sec,
two
of
their
attorneys
and
two
of
their
investigators.
there
was
some
33
persons
interrogated.
there
was
some
2200
pages
of
testimony
transcribed.
there
was
some
60
exhibits
that
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
while
we
flatly
disagreed
with
the
conclusion
of
the
reorganization
trustee,
at
least
he
was
fair
enough
to
say
that
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees
and
the
participants
gave
every
possible
cooperation,
we
testified
everything
that
was
asked
for,
we
produced
every
record
that
was
sought.
may
i
say
to
your
honors
that
when
the
court
originally
passed
upon
the
plan
of
reorganization
incorporating
our
compromise
of
our
claim
it
had
before
it
everything
that
the
combined
and
cumulative
efforts
of
counsel
for
the
trustee,
counsel
for
the
sec,
counsel
for
the
creditors
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
could
bring
before
the
court.
now
in
one
respect,
i
see
i
have
only
five
minutes
and
i'd
hope
i'd
have
more.
in
one
respect
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
simmons
with
respect
to
our
claim.
the
charges
of
fraud
whenever
refuted
as
what
stated
yesterday,
we
filed
a
claim,
there
was
no
objection
filed.
now,
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
transpired
and
there
--
what
hearings
with
respect
to
our
claim
before
the
court.
on
april
24th,
1962,
after
the
plan
was
--
the
present
plan
was
prepared,
eight
days
before
it
was
submitted
for
approval,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
interrogated
the
trustee
with
respect
to
outstanding
litigation
and
claims
that
would
be
litigated
and
it
went
into
causes
of
action,
patent
claims,
the
wilmington
transaction
and
merrill-stevens.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
not
one
question
was
propounded
with
respect
to
any
defense
to
our
claim
or
to
any
claims
against
our
participants.
eight
days
later,
the
plan
came
up
for
approval.
again,
petitioner's
counsel
interrogated.
there
wasn't
again
one
question
asked
with
respect
to
our
claim
and
this
was
when
it
was
before
the
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
sec
on
the
approval,
the
sec's
counsel
questioned
the
trustee
as
to
what
were
his
reasons
for
approving
this
compromised
provision.
the
court
stated
that
it
had
a
jury
waiting
to
come
in,
it
had
another
case
ready
for
the
afternoon.
and
if
there
was
time
desired
to
review
this
matter,
it
would
set
the
matter
down
for
another
day.
at
this
point,
sec
counsel
stated
and
i
quote
from
record
2,
page
283,
“speaking
for
my
self
your
honor,
i
have
concluded”.
now
it
is
asserted
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
imply
that
they
were
satisfied.
i
make
no
implication.
satisfied
or
not,
they
had
the
opportunity.
they
were
requested
by
the
court,
“if
you
want
this
matter
set
down
for
a
day
certain,
we
will
do
it”
but
they
didn't
want
it.
what
they
wanted
really
was
and
they
then
requested
the
trustee
of
state,
how
did
they
arrive
at
the
compromise
which
he
stated.
the
court
then
submitted
a
memorandum
at
a
later
date
that
there
was
insufficient
on
the
record
of
proof.this
was
not
the
end
of
it.
this
was
in
1962.
the
matter
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
at
that
time,
the
counsel
for
the
trustee
set
forth
the
various
reasons
for
the
compromise
of
our
claim.
there
was
a
reversal,
as
your
honors
know,
because
of
the
priority
status
of
the
government's
nontax
claims.
when
the
matter
was
remanded
and
came
before
the
court
again,
on
november
4th,
1964
sec
counsel
inquired
as
to
the
general
manager
whether
any
attempt
had
been
made
to
negotiate
a
more
favorable
settlement.
it
was
answered.
no
effort
whatsoever
was
made
to
impugn
the
settlement.
they
disagree
with
the
reasons
for
the
settlement
to
request
us
to
appear
and
testify
and
we've
been
ready
on
any
and
every
occasion
or
to
produce
any
testimony
whatsoever.
there
was
a
further
hearing
on
january
19th,
1965
where
sec
counsel
inquired
the
reorganization
trustee's
counsel
as
to
the
status
of
litigation
even
with
respect
to
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
again,
there
was
no
request
for
any
interrogation,
any
criticism
whatsoever
with
respect
to
this
compromised
provision.
and
during
all
these
period,
petitioner's
counsel
which
portrays
itself
fulfilling
such
a
heroic
role
in
uncovering
all
these
matters
stood
there
silent
(inaudible).
no
interrogation,
no
inquiry
whatsoever.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
the
contention
that
this
record
is
inadequate
or
that
the
district
court
acted
improvidently
with
respect
to
our
claim
and
i
am
here
only
on
behalf
of
our
claim
is
absolutely
incorrect.
and
may
i
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
united
states
government,
which
is
the
--
one
of
the
largest
creditors,
has
not
objected
to
this
provision.
and
may
i
also
add
one
further
thing
with
respect
to
the
government.
in
1959,
the
united
states
department
of
justice,
at
a
hearing
before
the
court,
set
forth
on
the
record
that
it
had
made
an
investigation
of
our
claim
that
it
had
interrogated
our
representatives.
with
our
consent
had
gone
through
all
books,
records
and
documents
and
were
thoroughly
satisfied
with
respect
to
this
claim.
i
know
that
i
can't
go
further
that
i
had
wanted
to
present
certain
--
the
aspect
of
the
two,
your
honors.
i
merely
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
we
are
in
this
position
at
this
time.
we
have
compromised
twice,
thinking
that
we
had
eliminated
the
problem,
apparently
we
haven't.
we
have
surrendered
our
mortgages
at
the
direction
of
the
district
court.
we
no
longer
even
have
those.
our
property
is
now
subject
and
subordinate
to
a
mortgage
that
was
issued
to
fulfill
and
consummate
this
plan
of
reorganization
to
that
mortgage.
neither
the
sec
nor
the
petitioner
objected.
we
are
afforded
in
an
absolutely
untenable
position
as
a
result
of
no
efforts
on
our
part.
we
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
this
situation
today.
we
have
been
prepared
to
substantiate
our
position.
we
have
filed
our
claim.
we
have
been
ready
to
fight
and
we
have
never
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
it
would
seem
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
as
a
mater
of
fundamental
equity
here,
our
position
should
be
preserved.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
we
cannot
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
matter,
at
least
with
respect
to
our
claim
having
been
compromised
and
the
adjusted
therefore
full
and
complete
and
adequate
hearings
in
the
record,
that
compromise
should
stand.
we
cannot
at
this
point
be
restored
to
our
position.
our
mortgages
cannot
be
reinstated
because
that
may
now
be
intervening
equities,
which
no
court
i
think
that
it
could
eliminate.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
and
it
seems
to
me
irrespective
of
what
may
have
and
i
don't
know
what
happened
or
what
the
court's
position
will
be
but
we
should
be
preserved
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
compromise
which
we
have
in
good
faith
carried
out.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
you're
the
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
i
am
not.
i'm
not
(inaudible)
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
this
is
the
first
laugh
i've
gotten
out
of
this
proceeding
so
forgive
me.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
admonish
this
court.
i
do
believe
that
under
section
27,
there
has
been
a
compromise
made.
it
has
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
and
if
other
provisions
of
the
plan
do
not
stand,
this
compromise
should
be
honored
and
respected
and
at
least
built
in
within
any
type
of
agreement.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir
and
we
are
holding
the
money.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
except
your
honor
please,
if
i
may
intrude.
what
do
we
do
to
preserve
our
situation
in
enforcing
it
in
any
subsequent
proceeding?
we
no
longer
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
--
have
our
mortgages
and
they've
been
satisfied
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
--
and
they're
probably
has
been
subordinated.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
so
how
can
we
preserve
our
position
in
any
further
proceedings?
we
are
at
this
point
not
in
the
position
where
we
can
assert
the
lien
claim
that
we
had.
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
the
power
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
restore
it
now.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
we
have
$250,000,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes
sir.
we
compromise
it
and
we're
prepared
to
stand
on
that
compromise.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer
i'd
like
to
know
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
in
violation
of
any
order
of
a
court.
i'll
be
subjected
to
further
proceeding.
yes,
sir,
this
is
also
important
to
us.
