mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
other
members
of
the
court,
may
i
please
the
court.
there
are
four
issues
involved
in
this
case,
four
general
areas
of
issues
and
i
want
to
divide
my
time
between
the
four
of
them,
approximately
15
minutes
each
roughly,
leaving
mr.
spitzer
to
take
his
part
of
the
argument.
now
i'm
going
to
discuss
them
in
this
order
there
is
the
question
of
insolvency,
is
the
debtor
insolvent,
though
the
stockholders
are
to
be
excluded
from
it.
the
second
issue
is
about
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
you
heard
–
been
discussing
that
more
than
anything
else
here.
the
third
is
whether
the
stockholders
should
be
invited
by
the
court
to
file
recession
claims
based
on
the
alleged
frauds
that
took
place
back
before
the
reorganization
began.
we
haven't
had
much
discussion
on
that
issue
yet.
and
the
fourth
issue
is
about
the
compromises
of
the
claims,
and
we're
talking
about
two
claims,
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
which
i'll
discuss
and
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
which
mr.
spitzer
will
discuss
because
he
is
their
attorney
and
one
of
the
trustees.
and
i'm
going
to
take
them
up
one
at
a
time
and
i
would
appreciate
the
court
ask
me
questions
about
each
one
of
these
four
things
at
the
same
time,
although
i
have
no
objection
to
get
operandi
in
the
other,
if
you
want
--
if
you
feel
it
pertinent.
now
about
insolvency.
there
should
be
no
question
about
this
debtor
being
insolvent.
it's
the
weakest
part
in
the
whole
case.
let
me
just
give
you
the
facts
and
before
i
get
into
the
facts
on
this,
i
want
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
in
every
one
of
these
issues,
if
you're
going
to
reverse
the
lower
court,
you're
going
to
have
to
take
that
record
that
stacks
up
this
high
and
study
those
facts
and
place
yourself
in
a
position
of
that
trial
judge
and
ask
and
try
to
decide
whether
you
would
have
decided
those
facts
differently.
you
might
have,
you
might
have
in
some
instances,
but
i
doubt
it.
judge
cho,
judge
amet
cho
who
had
been
on
the
bench
a
long
time
and
practiced
law
a
long
time
before
he
went
on
the
bench,
he's
retired
or
aged
70
here
about
a
year
or
two
ago,
but
still
continues
to
handle
a
case.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i'll
get
to
that
when
i
get
there.
there's
a
lot
in
the
record.
your
honor
there's
plenty
in
the
record.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i
know.
my
argument
assumes
that
there's
plenty
in
the
record
on
the
facts
to
sustain
the
compromises
and
if
you
read
what
i've
outlined
in
my
brief
in
the
record
on
that
--
you'll
know
a
lot
about
the
merrill-stevens
claim
and
it's
objections.
you
need
just
about
all
you
need
to
know
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
compromise
would
be
acceptable
or
not.
my
statement
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
a
lot
of
facts
in
the
record.
now
on
the
question
of
insolvency,
what
does
the
evidence
in
fact
show?
the
total
claims
against
this
debtor
were
in
were
in
excess
$5,400,000.
of
these
claims,
over
2
million
were
either
preferred
claims,
like
government
tax
claims
and
non-tax
claims
that
had
preference
or
they
were
claims,
secured
claims,
maritime
lien
claims
or
mortgage
claims
like
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
the
company
operates
under
the
trustee.
the
company
started
out
and
only
it
was
in
existence
about
a
couple
of
years
before
it
went
on
and
it
had
this
idea,
it
was
run
by
this
man
named
rad
and
he
had
the
idea
of
rolling
on,
called
roll
on
roll
off
method
of
hauling
freight,
back
in
1956.
you
roll
the
trailers,
the
highway
trailers
on
to
the
vessel
and
then
you
roll
them
off
at
the
other
end,
overseas
and
you
don't
have
to
have
stevedore
and
it's
a
lot
easier
to
load
and
unload
and
you
use
the
same
trucks
for
a
line
haul
on
each
end.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
the
thing.
back
in
the
mid
1950s
this
was
sort
of
a
coming
thing,
so
it
caught
on.
since
the
trustee
has
taken
over
he
has
restricted
his
operations
to
hauling
these
trailer
ships
as
we
call
them
between
miami
and
puerto
rico
and
between
jacksonville
and
puerto
rico
and
all
they
used
this
business
is
five
old
world
war
ii
lst
converted,
the
guts
were
taken
out
of
them
and
you
try
and
fix
them
up
so
you
can
haul
freight
and
they
are
hauled
by
sea
going
tugs.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
company
was
organized
in
1955
or
it
maybe
it
was
in
the
end
of
1954
and
the
reorganization
proceedings
began
in
june
1957.
they
are
now
in
their
11th
year.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir.
a
little
over
two
years.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
sir
it
may
be
in
there
but
we
don't
consider
it
material
at
this
point.
a
lot
has
happened
since
it
began.
getting
back
to
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
--
whether
it's
solvent
or
insolvent,
as
against
these
$5,400,000
in
claims
of
which
over
2
million
were
preferred
or
secured
or
claimed
to
be
secured.
the
valuation
hearings
held
in
the
spring
of
1962
disclosed
that
the
assets
of
the
company
were
worth
less
than
$2
million,
that
is
the
assets
being
primarily
these
old
world
war
ii
lsts
that
were
being
kept
--
that
they
were
--
had
converted
into
barges
and
were
running,
plus
their
motor
vehicle
equipment
and
shop
equipment
and
terminal
equipment
was
worth
less
than
$2,000.
we
had
valuation
proceedings
which
are
rather
extensive
in
the
record
on
the
value
of
these
assets.
2
million,
i'm
sorry
i
made
a
mistake.
but
the
business
had
made
money
under
the
trustee
whereas
it
had
not
made
money
under
the
former
poor
management
that
ran
it
in
the
ground,
because
he
was
a
good
successful
trustee
they
made
money
and
–
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
company
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
before
and
he
met
all
of
those
requirements
of
the
statute,
he
wasn't
a
stockholder,
he
wasn't
a
creditor.
he
had
no
interest,
he
never
heard
of
tmt
until
the
court
appointed
him
as
trustee.
so
the
company
had
made
money
under
the
trusteeship
and
it's
going
concern
value
based
on
it's
earnings
under
the
trusteeship
up
to
that
time
reflected
that
it's
value
was
worth
more
than
this
$2
million
in
assets.
our
expert
that
is
the
trustee's
expert
on
the
subject
placed
the
going
concern
value
at
$1,800,000.
the
expert
put
on
the
stand
by
the
stockholders
committee,
placed
the
going
concern
value
at
about
$4,000,500.
the
trustee
computed
the
going-concern
value
at
about
$2
million,
and
the
district
judge
found
the
going-concern
value
to
be
$2,780,000.
this
was
based
on
the
then
high
earnings
of
the
company
that
is
the
estimated
earnings
for
the
year
1962
capitalized,
is
the
way
the
court
found
that
value.
the
earnings
during
the
seven
years
of
the
trusteeship
that
are
that
the
--
firm
figures
are
in
the
record
that
is
for
the
years
1958
to
1964
varied,
the
net
earnings
varied
from
$200,000
per
year
to
$524,000.
they
have
been
less
in
recent
years.
they've
had
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that
is
--
this
is
in
the
record,
these
are
--
financial
statements
are
in
the
record
certified
by
that
certified
public
account
as
to
the
earnings
of
the
company.
the
court
accepting
these
financial
statements
as
accurate
made
of
finding
of
going-concern
value.
now
in
determining
whether,
bear
in
mind
that
the
issue
is
not
what
is
the
going-concern
value
of
the
debtor,
the
issue
is
the
debtor
solvent
or
not.
so
this
going-concern
value
does
not
have
to
be
fixed
and
determined
accurately,
as
you
would
in
a
condemnation
suit
or
possibly
a
rate
base
in
a
rate
case.
the
only
reason
for
computing
the
going-concern
value
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
debtor
is
solvent.
in
this
case
it's
important
because
of
the
success
of
the
trustee;
the
going-concern
value
is
more
than
the
cash
value
or
the
value
of
the
assets
from
sales.
the
district
judge
found
it
to
be,
he
found
it
to
be
$2,780,000.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
value
that
you
would
pay
for
this
business
as
a
going-concern
and
it
is
computed
by
capitalizing
the
estimated
earnings
of
the
business,
not
its
sale
value
of
its
assets.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
the
sale
or
cash
value
of
its
assets,
no.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
by
going-concern
value
we
mean
what
is
its
value
as
a
going
business
earning
money.
earning
money
and
it's
based
on
the
capitalization
of
the
earnings.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
going-concern
value
is
computed
on
profits,
on
the
earnings
of
the
business.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
as
distinguished
from
the
value
of
the
physical
assets
itself.
now
the
only
criticism,
the
sec
admits
that
it
appears
that
from
these
figures
that
i
have
given
you
this,
this
debtor
is
hopelessly
insolvent
and
i
want
to
--
before
i
get
to
their
point,
i
want
to
point
this
out
that
the
$5,400,000
figure
of
the
total
value
of
the
claims
is
not
the
figure
that
you
have
to
use
to
determine
solvency
or
not.
interest
must
be
paid
to
creditors
on
their
claims
before
stockholders
can
get
anything
if
the
company
is
solvent
and
the
courts
have
so
held.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
in
this
case
$5,400,000
in
claims,
but
through
the
years
the
interest
on
these
claims
would
make
the
insolvency
even
greater
than
it
would
appear
from
the
figures
that
i
have
given.
now
the
only
real
issue
in
this
point
is
did
the
district
court
fail
to
consider
evidence
of
probable
growth
of
the
business
after
reorganization.
the
sec's
contention
is
that
the
law
requires
recognition
of
contemplated
changes
in
operations
and
acquisitions
that
are
likely
to
take
place
after
reorganization.
they
are
indicated
in
this
case
that
those
changes
will
have
to
take
place.
these
changes
will
have
to
take
place
because
these
old
lsts
have
got
to
be
replaced.
they
were
expendable.
they
were
built
22
years
ago,
and
they
were
designed
to
be
destroyed
quickly
and
they
don't
have
thick
skins
and
this
company
spends
tremendous
sums
of
money
every
year
to
the
coast
guard,
makes
them
bring
them
in,
replate
them
and
they
just
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
every
year
and
it's
in
the
record,
keeping
these
old
lsts
running,
they've
got
to
be
replaced
by
more
modern
barges.
so
naturally
the
trustee
is
looking
and
thinking
about
replacing
them
and
what's
going
to
be
the
cost.
it
is
going
to
cost
from
$1
million
to
$2
million
to
build
another
type
vessel
that
will
be
efficient
and
you
got
to
have,
you
got
to
replace
all
five
of
them.
but
that's
as
far
as
the
trustee
can
go.
he
can't
commit
in
his
planning
the
reorganized
company
what
it's
going
to
do
to
replace
these
vessels.
he
can't
determine
the
financing
of
this
thing.
in
fact
the
sec
even
says,
he
shouldn't
even
be
thinking
about
it
and
yet
in
their
argument
they
say
that
the
trustee
should
have
brought
in
to
the
court
an
estimate
of
going-concern
value
based
on
prospective
earnings
in
the
future,
based
on
new
vessels
and
new
financing
of
those
vessels
in
the
future.
now
the
trial
court
after
hearing
all
this
evidence
on
this
subject,
and
we
did
have
two
experts
that
looked
into
the
future
and
gave
their
opinion,
the
trial
court
said
all
this
speculation
about
future
profits
and
earnings
on
the
change
conditions
with
new
vessels
and
new
kind
of
financing
is
not
reliable.
the
most
reliable
information
is
that
which
we
have
of
the
trustees'
own
operations
and
everything
is
in
this
record
concerning
what
has
been
done
under
all
the
years
of
the
trustees
operations
up
to
the
time
the
two
evaluation
hearings
were
held
and
bear
in
mind
that
this
plan
has
been
through
the
mail
twice.
it
went
through
the
mail
once
in
1962,
it
went
up
to
the
appellate
court
and
came
back
and
the
same
plan
has
been
through
the
mail
again.
so
we've
had
two
evaluation
hearings,
one
in
1962
and
another
one
in
1965
and
the
trustees
–
and
the
court
found
that
the
company
in
1965
had
not
been
making
as
much
money
as
it
had
before
the
previous
evaluation
hearings
and
so
it
said
that
if
it
had
to
make
another
finding
of
going
concern
value
it
would
be
less
now
than
it
was
at
that
time.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
unsecured
creditors
had
originally
about
three
3,200,000
and
the
preferred
and
secured
2,200,000.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right.
now
we
converted
--
one
of
the
compromises
was
to
convert
$5,574,000
of
the
alleged
secured
claims
of
merrill-stevens
over
in
to
the
unsecured
class,
that
was
the
compromise
and
reduce
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
all
of
he
unsecured
creditors,
got
all
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
didn't
get
any,
now
since
you've
asked
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i'll
go
into
that
now
because
it's
important.
this
is
the
simplest
most
equitable
plan
of
reorganization
you
can
think
of.
i
can't
think
of
a
simpler
one.
i've
outlined
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
claims.
in
the
plan
of
reorganization
since
debtor
is
obviously
insolvent,
all
the
new
common
stock
is
given
the
unsecured
or
common
creditors
in
proportion
to
their
claims,
when
we
got
through
converting
some
of
them
to
--
in
compromising
some
of
them
over
to
unsecured
they
total
about
three
million,
seven
or
eight
thousand
dollars.
so
the
company
is
turned
over
to
its
unsecured
creditors
and
they
swap
their
claims
for
the
common
stock
prorata
and
the
secured
creditors
and
the
preferred
creditors
are
all
paid
all
in
cash
and
your
honors
they
have
been
paid
off
in
cash.
they
have
been
paid
off
in
cash.
this
plan
has
been
consummated
substantially.
all
the
preferred
creditors
and
all
the
secured
creditors
have
been
paid.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
$574,000
of
it
was
and
it's
compromise
was
to
convert
it
to
unsecured
and
it
has
been
paid
in
stock.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir,
out
of
the
$1,600,000
claim,
roughly
1
million
of
it
was
unsecured
from
the
beginning
and
nearly
600,000
was
preferred.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
capital
and
mortgage
claim
of
330,000
plus
interest,
costs,
attorneys
fees
and
everything
was
settled
for
$250,000
in
cash
and
the
250,000
has
been
paid
to
it.
that's
the
plan,
it's
a
simpler
plan
as
you
can
think
of
and
that
is
the
plan
that
they
were
trying
to
sustain
here,
to
turn
this
company
over
its
common
creditor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
sir,
the
company
is
insolvent
so
they
have
no
equity
in
it
and
no
right
to
participate
and
since
the
company
is
hopelessly
insolvent
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
another
issue,
that's
an
entirely
different
issue.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
a
little
over
two
years,
two
and
a
half
years
at
the
most.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
your
honor
rather,
rather
amazing.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
it
had
it
had
a
lot
of
stockholders.
at
the
time
the
reorganization
proceeding
began
there
were
a
lot
of
stockholders
that
bought
the
stock
on
the
open
market.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
it
was
--
most
of
it
was
issued
to
persons
in
payment
for
services
and
materials
and
supplies
and
equipment
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
some
of
it
was
issued
for
cash
and
sold,
very
little
of
it
was
registered.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right
very
little
of
it.
getting
into
the
--
so
closing
out
the
--
on
the
issue
of
insolvency
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
this
debtor
is
insolvent
and
i
don't
see
how
the
court
find
otherwise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
only
some
of
them,
when
i
come
to
discussing
the
compromises
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
weren't
though,
we
decided
that
they
--
we
pursued
some
of
it,
we
pursued
we
filed
two
suits
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
principal
ones
they
are
complaining
about
are
the
counter
claims
against
the
claims
of
merrill-stevens
and
the
captain
mortgage.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right
i
do.
one
more
point
on
that
insolvency,
if
you
wiped
out
--
your
honor
if
you
wiped
out
those
claims
entirely,
you
wiped
out
those
two
claims
entirely
nearly
$2,000,000
worth,
the
company
would
still
be
insolvent.
the
fact
of
insolvency
is
the
most
important
fact
here
because
these
stockholders
have
got
no
right
to
complaint
against
the
compromise
of
these
claims,
because
they
have
no
equity
in
them,
the
compromise
is
of
concern
only
to
the
creditors.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
it
is
my
opinion
your
honor
that
if
you
took
every
favorable
factor
that
they
have,
i
still
don't
believe
it
would
be
solvent
because
you'd
have
to
add
interest
to
those
claims
and
if
you
took
their
experts
most
favorable
one,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
solvent,
i'll
go
into
the
rest
of
it
tomorrow.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
--
the
issued
that
i
will
discuss
first
this
morning
is
the
issue
concerning
the
employment
of
the
trustee
by
the
reorganized
company.
the
success
of
the
trustee
in
operating
the
business
of
a
data
is
best
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
when
he
took
over
in
november
of
1959
--
1957,
almost
exactly
10
years
ago,
business
was
at
a
stand
still.
the
ships
were
not
moving.
they
were
in
bad
need
of
repair
and
there
was
little
hope
for
the
business
so
everyone
thought.
under
his
able
management,
the
business
grew
to
the
point
where
by
1964,
the
end
of
the
--
or
1965,
when
we
began
by
the
end
of
1965,
when
we
began
to
consummate
the
present
plan
of
reorganization,
the
business
was
able
to
pay
off
in
cash
over
$1,500,000
in
claims
being
all
of
the
preferred
claims
and
all
of
the
secured
claims.
of
this
sum,
about
$1,100,000
went
to
the
united
states
government
for
its
tax
and
nontax
claims.
and
of
--
and
$250,000
went
to
the
--
to
pay
off
the
caplan
mortgage,
the
compromise
of
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
this
--
the
payment
of
this
large
sum
of
money
to
pay
off
all
of
these
claimants
in
these
two
categories,
did
not
come
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
business.
most
of
it
came
from
a
loan
of
$1,250,000
that
the
reorganized
company
was
permitted
by
the
court
to
make
from
a
bank
in
florida,
a
long-term
loan
which
reorg
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
rest
of
it
came
out
of
the
earnings.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
total
of
the
claims
was
--
in
excess
of
$1,500,000,
so
of
that
sum
approximately
between
$250,000
and
$300,000
came
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
data.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
earnings
had
been
a
great
deal
more
than
that.
most
of
the
earnings
had
been
plowed
back
in
to
the
business
to
purchase
new
or
purchase
more
lst's.
when
the
trustees
took
over,
they
were
operating
only
three
of
these
old
world
war
ii
lst's.
during
his
tenure,
they
have
purchased
and
converted
two
more
of
the
lst's
so
they're
operating
five.
and
most
of
the
earnings
of
the
business
during
that
period
of
time
had
to
be
plowed
back
into
additional
assets.
so
it
was
inevitable,
almost
inevitable
that
persons
who
were
interested
in
inquiring
this
company
upon
reorganization
would
want
to
retain
the
services
of
--
the
good
services
of
this
trustee,
and
so
it
was
has
it
been
emphasized
in
all
of
the
briefs.
all
of
the
plans
of
reorganization
have
contemplated
the
retention
of
the
services
of
this
trustee.
the
present
plan
of
reorganization,
this
internal
plan
which
i
have
described
to
the
court,
was
prepared
by
the
committee
appointed
by
the
district
judge
to
represent
the
unsecured
creditors
as
a
class.
this
committee
--
the
larger
creditors
of
course
were
represented
by
their
own
counsel.
and
so
the
court
appended
a
committee
of
two
experienced
local
attorneys
to
represent
the
general
mass
of
the
unsecured
creditors.
and
this
committee
presented
and
suggested
this
internal
plan
of
reorganization
which
included
the
two
compromises
of
the
claims
that
are
among
the
issues
here
and
also
included
a
provision
which
contemplated
the
retention
of
the
trustee's
management
by
the
reorganized
company.
it
did
not
require
the
retention
of
that
management.
it
merely
permitted
it
and
put
everyone
on
notice
that
though
--
the
proponents
of
the
plan
contemplated
the
possible
retention
of
the
trustee
and
his
good
management
team.
now,
our
first
point
of
course
is
that
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
preclude
the
employment
of
the
trustee
and
all
of
the
recorded
cases
thus
far,
that
have
touched
on
this
subject
have
permitted
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
or
rather
more
accurately
stated,
cases
as
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
they
have
cited
to
the
court
instances
where
the
trustee
has
been
retained
or
employed
by
a
reorganized
company.
and
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
decisions
where
that
has
been
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
appears
to
us
that
the
matter
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
under
section
221
(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
simply
requires
a
complete
disclosure
of
the
identity,
qualifications
and
affiliations
of
the
persons
who
are
to
be
the
initial
directors
and
officers
of
the
reorganized
company
and
the
finding
that
their
appointment
by
the
court
would
be
compatible
with
the
interest
of
the
data
and
consistent
with
public
policy.
we
think
this
is
a
finding
of
fact
to
be
made
in
each
case.
it
has
been
made
in
this
case
by
the
district
judge
that
this
trustee's
retention
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
data.
the
opposing
contention
is
based
upon
an
interpretation
of
sections
156
and
158
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
pertain
to
the
appointment
of
a
disinterested
trustee.
but
nothing
in
those
statutes
asses
or
implies
that
an
interest
in
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
is
a
disqualification
to
act
as
trustee.
opposing
counsel
would
write
into
the
statute
a
meaning
that
is
not
stated.
their
position
is
not
sound
and
presupposes
that
a
trustee
will
necessarily
breach
his
trust
if
he
contemplates
continuation
of
his
employment.
this
is
contrary
to
human
experience
or
a
person
with
an
incentive
will
do
a
better
job
than
one
who
knows
that
his
services
will
be
terminated
no
matter
how
well
he
performs.
opposing
argument
of
opposing
counsel
of
course
overlooks
the
benefits
to
the
data
of
being
able
to
retain
the
services
of
a
good
and
successful
trustee.
it
also
overlooks
the
fact
that
all
of
the
trustee's
actions
are
subject
to
court
approval.
the
criticism
that
you
have
heard
here
yesterday
expressed
of
this
trustee
and
the
things
that
he
did
involve
matters
that
were
all
approved
by
the
court.
for
example,
the
towing
contract,
the
award
of
a
towing
contract
was
criticized
and
the
recommendation
of
the
compromise
of
these
two
large
claims
was
criticized.
but
both
of
those
matters
have
been
the
subject
of
many
hearings
in
court
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
all
parties
and
throughout
this
proceeding.
that
has
been
true
with
respect
to
all
actions
of
the
trustee.
they
have
been
subjected
to
a
great
deal
of
scrutiny,
a
great
deal
of
criticism
by
the
stockholders
committee.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
trustee
is
a
retired
successful
merchant.
for
many
years,
he
was
a
manager
of
a
large
retail
department
store
and
a
successful
reputable
businessman
in
miami.
he'd
lived
in
miami
for
many
years.
he'd
been
associated
with
large
department
stores.
this
is
well-known
in
the
community.
he'd
retired
and
the
court
appointed
him
as
trustee.
he'd
had
no
interest
or
knowledge
of
tmt
at
all
before
that.
he'd
been
in
the
--
he's
just
a
good
businessman
and
he
brought
to
the
trusteeship
with
him
the
man
that
had
been
his
general
manager
and
right-hand
man
in
the
retail
merchandizing
business,
mr.
(inaudible),
who
brought
a
great
deal
of
know-how
and
sound
business
methods
to
this
trusteeship.
it
would
appear
that
opposing
counsel
would
write
into
the
bankruptcy
act
something
that
congress
has
not
written
into
it.
and
i
think
it
was
admitted
yesterday
that
in
1948
or
1958,
the
sec
sponsored
enacting
congress
that
would
have
expressly
prohibited
the
employment
of
a
trustee
for
a
period
of
two
years
after
the
conclusion
of
reorganization
proceedings
and
it
would
appear
that
the
sec
knows
that
congress
has
not
yet
prohibited
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
so
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
placed
a
proper
construction
on
the
statutes
involved
here
when
it
held
that
the
proponents
of
the
plan
that
that
--
what
the
--
the
dis
--
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
trustee
is
not
disinterested
unless
the
proponents
of
the
plan
assured
him
of
emoluments
and
security
rather
than
merely
nominating
him
for
approval
by
the
court
and
subject
to
the
usual
control
of
the
board
of
directors.
now,
one
of
the
most
imp
--
significant
factors
in
this
whole
issue
is
that,
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
disqualify
this
trustee
because
of
his
interest
in
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
or
for
any
other
reason.
if
the
position
of
opposing
counsel
is
correct,
this
trustee
has
been
disqualified
since
early
1959
for
that
was
the
first
time
when
a
plan
of
reorganization
was
proposed
that
contemplated
his
employment.
every
plan
has
contemplated
his
employment
since
early
1959.
so
we
say
to
the
court
that
it
is
too
late
now
to
urge
that
his
past
disqualification
prohibits
him
from
being
employed
in
the
future.
the
plan
has
been
substantially
consummated.
new
directors
have
taken
over
the
operations
of
the
business
and
are
running
the
company
with
this
trustee
in
his
team
in
charge
of
operations.
it
would
be
highly
inequitable
to
re
--
now
require
the
reorganized
company
to
fire
him
and
force
him
--
enforce
it
to
employ
a
less
qualified
person
to
run
the
business.
we
say
that
the
petitioner
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
are
now
estopped
to
raise
this
question
after
having
permitted
the
trustee
for
eight
years
to
operate
the
business
of
this
data,
knowing
all
that
time
that
he
was
being
considered
for
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
without
coming
in
and
specifically
asking
the
court
to
remove
him
for
that
reason.
another
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is,
that
this
issue
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
1964
decision
when
this
plan
of
reorganization
was
first
reviewed
by
that
court.
you
recall
it
has
been
reviewed
twice
and
we're
here
after
the
second
review.
the
very
provisions
of
the
plan
that
are
here
now
were
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
1964
and
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
those
provisions
in
the
plan
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
therefore,
that
decision
became
the
law
of
the
case
for
no
appeal
was
taken
from
it.
and
we
say
that
this
court
should
now
recognize
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
law
of
the
case
on
the
question
of
the
trustee's
employment
as
it
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1964.
when
the
fifth
circuit
sent
the
plan
back
in
1964,
it
sent
it
back
only
to
determine
its
feasibility
in
the
light
of
the
companion
decision
which
it
made
in
another
case
requiring
payment
in
full
of
the
government
nontax
claims.
these
claims
amounted
to
$900,000
so
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
the
data
would
be
able
to
do
it.
but
by
means
of
this
bank
loan
that
i
referred
to
a
while
ago,
the
$1,250,000
borrowed
in
that
amount
of
money,
the
data
was
able
to
pay
the
government
nontax
claims
in
full
as
well,
as
i
have
said,
all
other
preferred
and
secured
claims.
so
the
plan
of
reorganization
that
we
now
have
before
us,
the
amended
plan
is
amended
only
in
one
particular,
one
material
particular:
that
is
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
nontax
claims
of
the
government
in
full.
it
was
not
amended
in
any
particular
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
and
the
amended
plan
that
we
have
here
now
approves
the
appointment
of
the
same
officers
and
directors
of
the
reorganized
company
as
the
first
plan
did
back
in
1964
when
it
first
went
to
the
appellate
court.
now
the
court
well
knows
that
the
law
of
the
case
is
a
salutary
one
designed
to
end
litigation.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
and
other
courts,
it
should
be
recognized
and
followed,
unless
there
are
impelling
reasons
for
reversing
the
former
decision.
on
the
contrary
in
this
case,
there
are
impelling
reasons
for
allowing
it
to
stand.
number
one,
there's
been
no
effort
to
remove
the
trustee,
as
i
have
pointed
out.
number
two,
the
creditors,
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
here,
want
to
retain
the
trustee.
not
a
single
creditor,
not
one,
has
come
forward
to
object
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee
by
the
reorganized
company.
these
creditors
of
course
are
now
the
new
stockholders,
the
new
owners
of
the
reorganized
company.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
urged
to
the
district
court
the
approval
of
his
appointment
or
his
being
a
director
and
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
third,
substantial
consummation
of
this
plan
has
taken
place
as
i
have
previously
described
to
this
court.
and
it
would
certainly
serve
no
useful
purpose
in
this
case
to
prohibit
his
future
employment
because
of
a
--
an
alleged
statutory
pass
disqualification
to
serve
his
trustee.
and
finally,
it
is
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
district
court
so
found
that
the
best
interest
of
the
reorganized
company
require
to
re
--
they
require
the
retention
of
the
valuable
services
of
the
trustee
and
his
management
team.
i
would
like
to
--
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
on
that
point,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
next
point.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
asserted
time
and
time
again
in
pleadings
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i'd
have
to
put
it
this
way.
at
no
point
did
--
has
anybody
raised
any
of
these
things
as
it
faces
for
disqualifying
the
trustee
as
trustee.
they
keep
raising
them
in
this
litigation
through
the
years
as
a
reason
why
he
should
not
be
retained
or
employed
by
the
reorganized
company.
but
not
as
a
re
--
this
is
what's
inconsistent
about
the
whole
thing.
at
no
point
have
they
said,
and
i
think
counsel
for
the
sec
admitted
that
in
response
to
a
question
yesterday
that
they
had
not
raised
the
question
about
his
qualifications
as
trustee.
they
say
just
as
a
matter
of
prophylactic
rule
they
say,
that
he
shouldn't
be
retained
by
the
reorganized
company.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
because
there
was
never
any
issue
presented
to
the
court
on
it.
it
was
asserted
from
time
to
time.
it
was
asserted
that
the
trustee
for
example,
for
some
reason
favored
the
towing
company
that
he
recommended
that
the
towing
contract
was
awarded
to
that
that
the
fact
that
he
awarded
the
--
recommended
the
award
of
the
contract
without
competitive
bidding
or
something
like
that,
indicated
that
he
favored
that
company
as
against
maybe
somebody
else.
and
these
things
were
asserted
but
--
well
that
particular
issue
was
heard
in
connection
with
the
towing
contract
and
overruled.
the
court
approved
the
award
of
the
towing
contract
to
the
company
recommended
by
the
trustee.
that's
the
way
these
things
came
up.
on
individual
issues
and
actions
of
the
trustee,
they
would
object
to
him
and
the
court
would
enter
an
order.
and
in
no
time
was
a
clear
cut
issue
presented
to
the
court
that
the
trustee
was
disqualified.
the
next
issue
is
the
--
that
i
will
discuss
is
the
matter
of
the
compromise
of
the
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
now,
when
this
plan
came
back
from
the
appellate
court
in
1964
and
the
appellate
court
had
held
that
that
this
$900,000,
a
nontax
claim
to
the
government
had
to
be
paid
in
full
in
cash.
it
posed
a
real
practical
problem.
in
addition
--
because
in
addition
to
this
$1
million
--
actually
$1
million
one
--
$1,200,000
in
tax
and
preferred
claims
that
had
to
be
paid
in
cash.
there
were
these
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
i'm
adding
to
approximately
a
million
dollars.
well
something
had
to
give
or
it
would
not
be
able
to
work
out
a
plan
of
reorganization.
so,
it
was
inevitable
that
settlement
discussion
would
take
place
with
respect
to
these
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
two
largest
lien
claims
were
the
ones
in
controversy
here.
the
caplan
mortgage
was
in
the
principal
sum
of
$330,000
and
it
was
a
preferred
ship
mortgage
on
all
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
other
lien
claim
was
the
$574,000
lien
--
series
of
lien
claims
again
--
by
merrill-stevens
against
all
of
the
vessels
of
the
data.
so
with
the
approval
of
the
court
and
the
knowledge
of
everyone
concerned,
settlement
discussions
took
place
between
the
trustee,
the
trustee's
counsel
and
counsel
for
these
creditors.
and
the
result
was
that
when
this
creditors
committee
proposed
the
present
internal
plan
of
reorganization,
that
plan
included
in
it
as
an
integral
part
the
proposed
compromises
of
these
two
claims.
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
of
base
amount
of
$330,000,
which
had
added
to
it
interest,
cost
and
attorney's
fees
which
would
have
make
it
at
least
$500,000,
was
reduced
to
$250,000
payable
in
cash.
and
that
--
and
in
connection
with
the
consummation
of
the
plan
that
has
taken
place,
that
$250,000
has
been
paid
to
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees.
the
only
other
fact
in
that
compromise
was
that
the
interest
due
--
accrued
interest
due
on
that
mortgage
was
paid
against
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company
or
satisfied
by
giving
them
common
stock.
now,
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
lien
claims
against
the
vessel
amounted
to
$574,000
and
the
compromised
with
merrill-stevens
provided
that
those
claims
would
be
taken
off
of
the
vessels
entirely
and
that
amount
would
become
an
unsecured
claim
payable
in
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company.
and
that
was
the
settlement
there.
the
result
of
these
two
compromises
meant
that
the
plan
was
feasible;
that
instead
of
having
to
pay
up
perhaps
puts
to
a
million
dollars
or
satisfied
puts
to
a
million
dollars
in
lien
claims
of
preferred
ship
mortgage
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
data
would
only
have
to
pay
$250,000
and
the
balance
in
the
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company
which
it
didn't
cost
him
anything
in
cash.
and
as
a
result
of
these
compromises,
the
plan
was
made
feasible.
now,
the
objections
to
the
compromises
are,
the
sec
states
in
its
brief
that
the
record
contains
insufficient
facts
for
the
court
to
form,
to
make
an
informed
judgment
of
--
on
the
merits
of
the
compromise.
the
petitioner,
the
stockholders
committee,
in
addition
says
there
was
inadequate
investigation
of
the
objections
to
these
two
claims.
now
neither
of
these
contentions
is
sustained
by
the
record.
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
and
the
terrific
investigation
that
was
made
of
it.
it's
stated
in
our
brief
and
mr.
spitzer
represents
the
caplan
mortgage
people
and
will
go
into
the
details
of
that
during
his
time
before
the
court
when
i
finish.
but,
with
respect
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
the
numerous
pleadings
and
places
in
the
record
where
the
facts
concerning
this
claim
and
particularly
the
objections
to
it
are
set
forth
in
great
detail
particularly
by
opposing
counsel.
and
insofar
as
investigation
is
concerned,
the
record
shows
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
no
less
than
four
investigations
were
made
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
to
a
trustee's
investigation
in
1959
which
he
reported
in
his
opinion,
the
amount
of
the
claim
and
so
far
the
value
of
merrill-stevens
services
was
concerned
was
substantially
awarded
or
justified.
admittedly,
that
wasn't
much
of
an
investigation.
we
don't
have
much
in
the
record
on
it.
the
next
investigation
was
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigation
in
1961,
and
they
reported
that
rather
thoroughly
to
the
court
and
to
--
in
his
own
record.
the
stockholders
committee
made
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
recommended
--
they
reported
that
their
investigation
--
they
had
very
little
criticism
of
the
amount
of
the
claim.
bear
in
mind
that
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
was
$1,600,000
and
there
is
little
objection
to
the
fact
that
merrill-stevens
did
perform
extensive
work
on
the
vessel
and
for
which
it
was
not
paid.
and
there's
little
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
the
claim.
but
the
sec
objections
stated
that
merrill-stevens
did
not
--
the
main
objections
are
--
with
respect
to
the
million
dollar
claim
against
the
carib
queen
for
rebuilding
the
carib
queen,
merrill-stevens
did
not
properly
convert
the
vessel.
they
did
not
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
contract.
they
did
not
properly
repair
the
vessel
and
they
fail
to
establish
the
value
of
its
work
and
materials.
and
in
addition,
the
petitioner
in
its
charges
against
--
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
repeated
what
the
sec
had
said
and
went
on
to
say
to
charge
that
merrill-stevens
is
liable
in
thought
for
negligence
in
performing
the
work
on
the
vessel
causing
in
part
the
downfall
of
tmt.
they
also
charged
that
merrill-stevens
bought
stock
in
tmt
for
which
it
has
not
been
paid.
and
that
is
a
substance
of
the
charges
that
they
made
against
merrill-stevens.
merrill-stevens
filed
pleadings
denying
all
of
these.
and
in
addition
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigation
and
the
stockholders
committee
investigation,
the
trustee
or
rather
--
our
firm,
as
counsel
for
the
trustee,
took
all
of
these
information
that
was
made
available
to
us
by
the
sec
and
the
stockholders
committee
and
by
merrill-stevens
and
made
an
off-the-record
investigation
of
all
of
these
things
just
as
attorneys
always
do
in
connect
--
when
the
question
of
settlement
of
a
claim
is
being
considered.
we
studied
all
of
these
and
reported
to
the
court
that
--
as
follows,
two
attorneys
in
the
office
of
counsel
for
the
trustee
have
examined
the
factual
data,
gathered
in
the
trustee's
investigation
of
the
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
and
it
is
the
considered
opinion
of
both
attorneys
that
the
possibility
is
remote
of
obtaining
any
reduction
or
material
reduction
in
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim
by
litigating
the
objections
against
it.
trial
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
objections
would
be
time
consuming
and
would
result
in
unnecessary
delay
in
formulating
a
plan
of
reorganization.
that
is
our
considered
judgment
of
this
compromise
as
attorneys
for
the
trustee.
and
i
say
to
the
court
and
all
candidates,
one
thing
to
sit
up
in
your
office
and
prepare
pleadings
and
make
objections
and
file
fraud
charges.
but
it's
quite
another
thing
when
you're
on
the
firing
line
and
have
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
you're
going
to
file
a
lawsuit
by
the
claim
or
compromise
it
on
a
reasonable
basis.
and
we
advise
the
trustee
and
we
advise
the
court
that
this
compromise
should
be
accepted
and
the
court
accepted
our
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
and
that's
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
expressly,
the
--
bear
in
mind
that
the
proposed
compromises
were
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization.
and
therefore,
the
hearings
--
the
extensive
hearings
that
were
held
on
two
different
occasions
in
1962
and
in
1965
again,
on
the
merits
of
the
plan
whether
it
should
be
approved
or
not,
are
the
hearings
that
involved
everything
in
connection
with
the
plan,
including
these
objections.
and
our
report
to
the
court
on
this
was
--
came
out
in
there.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
we
had
--
no
evidence
was
taken
on
it.
we
had
in
these
investigation
reports
and
--
in
the
record,
sufficient
facts
to
show
on
the
one
hand
what
the
basis
of
merrill-stevens
claim
was
and
on
the
other
hand,
what
the
basis
of
the
objections
were
and
no
evidence
was
taken.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
stockholders
committee
kept
yelling
for
more
investigation,
more
investigation.
we
did
not
think
more
investigation
was
necessary.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
may
have.
but
in
the
meantime,
none
was
necessary
because
the
creditors
committee
had
proposed
the
compromises
and
we'd
recommended
the
approval
of
the
compromises
and
we
didn't
think
that
any
good
would
come
of
any
hearings
on
the
objection.
we
didn't
think
we
had
to
get
in
and
upheld
the
facts
before
the
court
and
try
the
thing
--
before
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
approval
of
the
compromise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
this
court
has
held
and
the
law
seems
to
be
clear
that
you
don't
have
to
hear
objections
to
a
claim,
parti
--
where
the
settlement
of
that
claim
is
proposed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
hearings
on
the
feasibility
and
the
fairness
and
so
forth
of
the
plan
that
are
held
in
--
are
the
hearings
in
which
those
matters
are
considered.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
our
principal
answer.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
where
the
compromises
proposed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization
and
the
hearings
that
you
have
on
that
are
the
--
the
hearings
on
the
plan
go
into
the
whole
thing
including
the
compromise,
if
you
don't
have
any
specific
hearing
on
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
any
basis
for
a
charge
of
fraud
in
this
case,
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
hearing.
for
one
of
the
things
we
emphasize
is
that
there's
no
facts
in
this
record
to
show
that
merrill-stevens
is
guilty
of
any
fraud.
now
--
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
counsel
appeared
yesterday,
said
that
merrill-stevens
was
guilty
of
fraud
and
in
the
next
breadth
said
the
fraud
was
connected
with
sha
--
with
abrams
and
shaffer
who
wrecked
the
company.
there's
not
a
thing
in
this
record
to
connect
merrill-stevens
with
shaffer
and
abrams
or
the
caplan
mortgage
people
at
all.
that
is
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
reorganization
proceedings
in
this
thing.
there
is
no
basis
and
this
is
the
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief.
there's
no
basis
for
fraud
against
--
the
only
charges
against
merrill-stevens
are
that
they
didn't
repair
the
vessel
properly
and
are
responsible
for
it
breaking
down
at
sea
and
things
of
that
kind.
things
involving
tort
claims
against
that
which
when
we
waived
these
things,
we
decided
that
the
burden
of
proof
just
wasn't
worth
going
after,
particularly
when
the
creditors
wanted
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
your
honor,
the
court
was
interested
and
so
are
we
as
counsel
for
the
trustee.
we're
anxious
to
recover
everything
possible
for
the
debtor
in
this
particular
case.
but
we
were
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
creditors
concerned
were
anxious
for
these
--
both
of
these
compromises
to
take
place
in
order
that
the
reorganization
not
be
delayed.
and
this
was
a
very
important
factor
and
we
felt
on
--
from
our
examination
of
the
facts
and
the
dispute
and
everything
and
we
still
stand
by
it,
that
it
was
not
the
objections
to
the
claim
were
not
--
did
not
warrant
litigation
in
view
of
the
fairness
of
the
proposed
compromise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
well,
we
argued
to
the
lower
court
that
there
were
no
basis
for
fraud
chares
that
this
was
a
factual
matter
and
we
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
breakdown
of
the
vessels
and
all
that
was
caused
by
merrill-stevens
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
vessel
was
accepted
by
the
government
authorities
and
everybody
concern
and
put
out
to
sea.
we
had
weighed
all
of
these
things
and
we
gave
the
results
of
our
weighing
of
these
matters
to
the
court.
now
this
is
a
way
cases
are
settled,
the
--
but
commonly
we
study
the
facts
and
you
report
and
recommend
to
your
client
the
basis
of
your
settlement.
we
didn't
try
to
spread
all
the
facts
and
the
reason
before
the
court
except
that
conclusion
on
the
matter.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
they
never
alleged
that
it
was
fraudulent.
they
merely
alleged
--
stated
the
objections.
they
stated
there
was
--
they'd
uncovered
evidence
to
indicate
that
merrill-stevens
was
--
may
have
been
guilty
of
negligence
or
breach
of
contract
in
some
manner
in
performing
the
work
on
these
vessels.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
we
never
tried
the
matter
except
to
consider
and
weigh
the
--
object
the
statements
that
merrill's
--
denials
of
merrill-stevens,
the
statements
on
the
other
side
and
then
the
court
considered
the
compromise
which
all
of
the
creditors
approved.
now
all
the
creditors
wanted
the
compromise
very
much.
i
think
i've
made
that
quiet
clear.
no
creditor
objected
to
the
compromise
and
the
creditors
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
they're
the
ones
who
would
benefit
by
the
compromise
or
would
benefit
by
any
recovery.
it
might
be
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
--
made
against
merrill-stevens.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes.
they
have
(inaudible)
and
through
here
objected
to
the
compromise,
only
on
the
basis
that
we
--
that
we
didn't
go
in
and
tried
the
thing.
now,
i
want
to
--
we
had
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
which,
what
we're
going
to
try
and
what
we're
not
going
to
try
about
all
these
claims
that
have
been
made
against
the
data.
and
i
want
to
--
my
time
is
about
up
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
are
advisers
to
the
court
and
to
the
trustee,
and
they
had
been
very
helpful
in
a
great
many
matters.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
i
don't
--
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
sec
here
has
made
a
kind
of
a
crusade
out
of
this
case
for
these
poor
stockholders.
we
think
that
they
should
be
just
as
concern
or
more
concerned
about
the
poor
creditors
because
creditors
come
ahead
of
stockholders.
and
we've
taken
the
position
that
the
creditors
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
they
want
these
compromises
and
they've
approved
this
plan
in
overwhelming
vote.
the
last
count
was
about
98
or
95%
approved
and
nobody
disapproved.
they
want
this
plan.
they
want
to
get
on
with
this
reorganization.
they
don't
want
to
take
the
time
and
go
back
and
fight
these
claims
out.
this
is
a
practical
matter
that
they
are
concerned
with.
i
do
want
to
conclude
by
just
pointing
out
one
thing
regarding
the
failure
of
the
trustee
to
bring
suits
to
recover
damages
against
persons
accused
of
fraudulent
practices
in
connection
with
transactions
involving
tmt
stock.
petitioner's
brief
makes
a
serious
and
unfounded
charge
against
the
trustee
and
against
me.
on
page
30
of
his
brief,
he
says
that
for
three
years
preceding
1965,
trustee's
counsel
for
that
--
in
1965,
trustee's
counsel
for
the
first
time
admitted
the
other
abandonment
of
these
suits.
now
--
and
on
page
15
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
repeats
his
charge
in
the
following
language.
the
trustee
failed
to
disclose
on
the
record
to
the
stockholders
or
creditors
or
the
sec
that
a
secret
understanding
was
actually
made
in
1962
to
suppress
the
suits
and
waive
the
setoffs.
this
was
disclosed
as
to
the
suits
for
the
first
time
in
1965.
and
what
they're
referring
to
in
1965
is
where
in
an
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
gonson
of
the
sec,
he
says
there's
a
contemplated
--
at
all
that
the
trustee
of
the
estate
would
institute
any
litigation
with
respect
to
the
caplan
mortgage
transaction
answered
by
mr.
simmons,
know
that
matter
has
been
settled
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
now,
i
want
to
refer
the
court
to
page
662
of
the
record,
in
record
number
2,
in
which
--
in
april
of
1962
when
we
were
beginning
to
consider
this
plan
of
reorganization,
this
is
the
report
that
the
trustee
and
i
made
to
the
court.
as
to
the
contention
of
the
stockholders
committee
that
there
are
causes
of
action
against
caplan
and
merrill-stevens,
which
could
result
in
recoveries
beyond
the
amount
of
the
claims,
that
trustee
has
been
advised
that
such
possibility
is
too
remote
to
warrant
the
expensive
litigation
and
to
delay
in
reorganization.
the
trustee
has
filed
two
suits
as
a
result
of
his
1960
investigation
of
the
caplan
mortgage
participants
and
others
who
had
dealings
with
the
form
of
management.
one
of
these
suits
is
against
joseph
abrams
and
others
involved
in
the
purchase
of
the
property
at
wilmington,
delaware.
the
other
is
against
eric
rath
(ph),
former
president-organizer
of
tmt,
recovers
in
these
suits
are
uncertain
amount
and
they
are
the
only
ones
considered
worthy
of
prosecution.
it
was
our
opinion
that
in
a
reorganization
case
you
have
to
look
to
the
future
and
not
to
the
past.
the
creditors
wanted
to
get
it
on
with
reorganization
and
they
did
not
want
to
waste
the
time
of
the
--
time
would
be
necessary
and
the
expense
in
prosecuting
these
all
--
suits
in
trying
to
punish
all
these
people
that
may
have
been
involved
in
the
downfall
of
tmt.
and
this
was
our
considered
judgment
and
this
was
made
a
matter
of
record
in
connection
with
the
hearings
proceeding,
the
first
consideration
of
the
plan
in
1962.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
we
got
a
judgment
against
mr.
rath
(ph),
the
ringleader
of
the
former
management
in
the
amount
of
a
$131,000
in
1963
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
collect
1-5
cent
a
piece
on
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
other
suit
is
still
pending
in
the
southern
district
court
of
new
york.
any
benefits
that
it
gets
come
under
the
plan
will
go
to
the
common
creditors
of
the
company
under
the
plan
of
reorganization.
so
far,
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
that
suit
and
so
far,
we
haven't
gotten
anywhere
with
it.
it's
not
over
with
yet,
but
we've
not
recovered
anything
with
it
enough.
now
those
are
the
two
suits
that
we
brought
and
we
considered
all
the
rest
of
them.
and
i'm
not
--
brought
anymore
because
we
didn't
feel
that
they
warranted
--
the
merits
of
them
didn't
warrant
it,
the
expense
was
not
warranted
and
the
delay
in
the
reorganization
case
was
not
warranted.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
because
the
facts
--
no,
because
the
facts
with
respect
to
those
objections
were
well-developed
in
the
various
investigation
that
were
made
to
be
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
they
were
no.
they
were
not.
the
rest
of
my
time
will
be
taken
--
of
our
time
will
be
taken
by
mr.
spitzer.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
other
members
of
the
court,
may
i
please
the
court.
there
are
four
issues
involved
in
this
case,
four
general
areas
of
issues
and
i
want
to
divide
my
time
between
the
four
of
them,
approximately
15
minutes
each
roughly,
leaving
mr.
spitzer
to
take
his
part
of
the
argument.
now
i'm
going
to
discuss
them
in
this
order
there
is
the
question
of
insolvency,
is
the
debtor
insolvent,
though
the
stockholders
are
to
be
excluded
from
it.
the
second
issue
is
about
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
you
heard
–
been
discussing
that
more
than
anything
else
here.
the
third
is
whether
the
stockholders
should
be
invited
by
the
court
to
file
recession
claims
based
on
the
alleged
frauds
that
took
place
back
before
the
reorganization
began.
we
haven't
had
much
discussion
on
that
issue
yet.
and
the
fourth
issue
is
about
the
compromises
of
the
claims,
and
we're
talking
about
two
claims,
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
which
i'll
discuss
and
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
which
mr.
spitzer
will
discuss
because
he
is
their
attorney
and
one
of
the
trustees.
and
i'm
going
to
take
them
up
one
at
a
time
and
i
would
appreciate
the
court
ask
me
questions
about
each
one
of
these
four
things
at
the
same
time,
although
i
have
no
objection
to
get
operandi
in
the
other,
if
you
want
--
if
you
feel
it
pertinent.
now
about
insolvency.
there
should
be
no
question
about
this
debtor
being
insolvent.
it's
the
weakest
part
in
the
whole
case.
let
me
just
give
you
the
facts
and
before
i
get
into
the
facts
on
this,
i
want
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
in
every
one
of
these
issues,
if
you're
going
to
reverse
the
lower
court,
you're
going
to
have
to
take
that
record
that
stacks
up
this
high
and
study
those
facts
and
place
yourself
in
a
position
of
that
trial
judge
and
ask
and
try
to
decide
whether
you
would
have
decided
those
facts
differently.
you
might
have,
you
might
have
in
some
instances,
but
i
doubt
it.
judge
cho,
judge
amet
cho
who
had
been
on
the
bench
a
long
time
and
practiced
law
a
long
time
before
he
went
on
the
bench,
he's
retired
or
aged
70
here
about
a
year
or
two
ago,
but
still
continues
to
handle
a
case.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i'll
get
to
that
when
i
get
there.
there's
a
lot
in
the
record.
your
honor
there's
plenty
in
the
record.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i
know.
my
argument
assumes
that
there's
plenty
in
the
record
on
the
facts
to
sustain
the
compromises
and
if
you
read
what
i've
outlined
in
my
brief
in
the
record
on
that
--
you'll
know
a
lot
about
the
merrill-stevens
claim
and
it's
objections.
you
need
just
about
all
you
need
to
know
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
compromise
would
be
acceptable
or
not.
my
statement
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
a
lot
of
facts
in
the
record.
now
on
the
question
of
insolvency,
what
does
the
evidence
in
fact
show?
the
total
claims
against
this
debtor
were
in
were
in
excess
$5,400,000.
of
these
claims,
over
2
million
were
either
preferred
claims,
like
government
tax
claims
and
non-tax
claims
that
had
preference
or
they
were
claims,
secured
claims,
maritime
lien
claims
or
mortgage
claims
like
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
the
company
operates
under
the
trustee.
the
company
started
out
and
only
it
was
in
existence
about
a
couple
of
years
before
it
went
on
and
it
had
this
idea,
it
was
run
by
this
man
named
rad
and
he
had
the
idea
of
rolling
on,
called
roll
on
roll
off
method
of
hauling
freight,
back
in
1956.
you
roll
the
trailers,
the
highway
trailers
on
to
the
vessel
and
then
you
roll
them
off
at
the
other
end,
overseas
and
you
don't
have
to
have
stevedore
and
it's
a
lot
easier
to
load
and
unload
and
you
use
the
same
trucks
for
a
line
haul
on
each
end.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
the
thing.
back
in
the
mid
1950s
this
was
sort
of
a
coming
thing,
so
it
caught
on.
since
the
trustee
has
taken
over
he
has
restricted
his
operations
to
hauling
these
trailer
ships
as
we
call
them
between
miami
and
puerto
rico
and
between
jacksonville
and
puerto
rico
and
all
they
used
this
business
is
five
old
world
war
ii
lst
converted,
the
guts
were
taken
out
of
them
and
you
try
and
fix
them
up
so
you
can
haul
freight
and
they
are
hauled
by
sea
going
tugs.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
company
was
organized
in
1955
or
it
maybe
it
was
in
the
end
of
1954
and
the
reorganization
proceedings
began
in
june
1957.
they
are
now
in
their
11th
year.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir.
a
little
over
two
years.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
sir
it
may
be
in
there
but
we
don't
consider
it
material
at
this
point.
a
lot
has
happened
since
it
began.
getting
back
to
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
--
whether
it's
solvent
or
insolvent,
as
against
these
$5,400,000
in
claims
of
which
over
2
million
were
preferred
or
secured
or
claimed
to
be
secured.
the
valuation
hearings
held
in
the
spring
of
1962
disclosed
that
the
assets
of
the
company
were
worth
less
than
$2
million,
that
is
the
assets
being
primarily
these
old
world
war
ii
lsts
that
were
being
kept
--
that
they
were
--
had
converted
into
barges
and
were
running,
plus
their
motor
vehicle
equipment
and
shop
equipment
and
terminal
equipment
was
worth
less
than
$2,000.
we
had
valuation
proceedings
which
are
rather
extensive
in
the
record
on
the
value
of
these
assets.
2
million,
i'm
sorry
i
made
a
mistake.
but
the
business
had
made
money
under
the
trustee
whereas
it
had
not
made
money
under
the
former
poor
management
that
ran
it
in
the
ground,
because
he
was
a
good
successful
trustee
they
made
money
and
–
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
company
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
before
and
he
met
all
of
those
requirements
of
the
statute,
he
wasn't
a
stockholder,
he
wasn't
a
creditor.
he
had
no
interest,
he
never
heard
of
tmt
until
the
court
appointed
him
as
trustee.
so
the
company
had
made
money
under
the
trusteeship
and
it's
going
concern
value
based
on
it's
earnings
under
the
trusteeship
up
to
that
time
reflected
that
it's
value
was
worth
more
than
this
$2
million
in
assets.
our
expert
that
is
the
trustee's
expert
on
the
subject
placed
the
going
concern
value
at
$1,800,000.
the
expert
put
on
the
stand
by
the
stockholders
committee,
placed
the
going
concern
value
at
about
$4,000,500.
the
trustee
computed
the
going-concern
value
at
about
$2
million,
and
the
district
judge
found
the
going-concern
value
to
be
$2,780,000.
this
was
based
on
the
then
high
earnings
of
the
company
that
is
the
estimated
earnings
for
the
year
1962
capitalized,
is
the
way
the
court
found
that
value.
the
earnings
during
the
seven
years
of
the
trusteeship
that
are
that
the
--
firm
figures
are
in
the
record
that
is
for
the
years
1958
to
1964
varied,
the
net
earnings
varied
from
$200,000
per
year
to
$524,000.
they
have
been
less
in
recent
years.
they've
had
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that
is
--
this
is
in
the
record,
these
are
--
financial
statements
are
in
the
record
certified
by
that
certified
public
account
as
to
the
earnings
of
the
company.
the
court
accepting
these
financial
statements
as
accurate
made
of
finding
of
going-concern
value.
now
in
determining
whether,
bear
in
mind
that
the
issue
is
not
what
is
the
going-concern
value
of
the
debtor,
the
issue
is
the
debtor
solvent
or
not.
so
this
going-concern
value
does
not
have
to
be
fixed
and
determined
accurately,
as
you
would
in
a
condemnation
suit
or
possibly
a
rate
base
in
a
rate
case.
the
only
reason
for
computing
the
going-concern
value
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
debtor
is
solvent.
in
this
case
it's
important
because
of
the
success
of
the
trustee;
the
going-concern
value
is
more
than
the
cash
value
or
the
value
of
the
assets
from
sales.
the
district
judge
found
it
to
be,
he
found
it
to
be
$2,780,000.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
value
that
you
would
pay
for
this
business
as
a
going-concern
and
it
is
computed
by
capitalizing
the
estimated
earnings
of
the
business,
not
its
sale
value
of
its
assets.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
the
sale
or
cash
value
of
its
assets,
no.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
by
going-concern
value
we
mean
what
is
its
value
as
a
going
business
earning
money.
earning
money
and
it's
based
on
the
capitalization
of
the
earnings.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
going-concern
value
is
computed
on
profits,
on
the
earnings
of
the
business.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
as
distinguished
from
the
value
of
the
physical
assets
itself.
now
the
only
criticism,
the
sec
admits
that
it
appears
that
from
these
figures
that
i
have
given
you
this,
this
debtor
is
hopelessly
insolvent
and
i
want
to
--
before
i
get
to
their
point,
i
want
to
point
this
out
that
the
$5,400,000
figure
of
the
total
value
of
the
claims
is
not
the
figure
that
you
have
to
use
to
determine
solvency
or
not.
interest
must
be
paid
to
creditors
on
their
claims
before
stockholders
can
get
anything
if
the
company
is
solvent
and
the
courts
have
so
held.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
in
this
case
$5,400,000
in
claims,
but
through
the
years
the
interest
on
these
claims
would
make
the
insolvency
even
greater
than
it
would
appear
from
the
figures
that
i
have
given.
now
the
only
real
issue
in
this
point
is
did
the
district
court
fail
to
consider
evidence
of
probable
growth
of
the
business
after
reorganization.
the
sec's
contention
is
that
the
law
requires
recognition
of
contemplated
changes
in
operations
and
acquisitions
that
are
likely
to
take
place
after
reorganization.
they
are
indicated
in
this
case
that
those
changes
will
have
to
take
place.
these
changes
will
have
to
take
place
because
these
old
lsts
have
got
to
be
replaced.
they
were
expendable.
they
were
built
22
years
ago,
and
they
were
designed
to
be
destroyed
quickly
and
they
don't
have
thick
skins
and
this
company
spends
tremendous
sums
of
money
every
year
to
the
coast
guard,
makes
them
bring
them
in,
replate
them
and
they
just
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
every
year
and
it's
in
the
record,
keeping
these
old
lsts
running,
they've
got
to
be
replaced
by
more
modern
barges.
so
naturally
the
trustee
is
looking
and
thinking
about
replacing
them
and
what's
going
to
be
the
cost.
it
is
going
to
cost
from
$1
million
to
$2
million
to
build
another
type
vessel
that
will
be
efficient
and
you
got
to
have,
you
got
to
replace
all
five
of
them.
but
that's
as
far
as
the
trustee
can
go.
he
can't
commit
in
his
planning
the
reorganized
company
what
it's
going
to
do
to
replace
these
vessels.
he
can't
determine
the
financing
of
this
thing.
in
fact
the
sec
even
says,
he
shouldn't
even
be
thinking
about
it
and
yet
in
their
argument
they
say
that
the
trustee
should
have
brought
in
to
the
court
an
estimate
of
going-concern
value
based
on
prospective
earnings
in
the
future,
based
on
new
vessels
and
new
financing
of
those
vessels
in
the
future.
now
the
trial
court
after
hearing
all
this
evidence
on
this
subject,
and
we
did
have
two
experts
that
looked
into
the
future
and
gave
their
opinion,
the
trial
court
said
all
this
speculation
about
future
profits
and
earnings
on
the
change
conditions
with
new
vessels
and
new
kind
of
financing
is
not
reliable.
the
most
reliable
information
is
that
which
we
have
of
the
trustees'
own
operations
and
everything
is
in
this
record
concerning
what
has
been
done
under
all
the
years
of
the
trustees
operations
up
to
the
time
the
two
evaluation
hearings
were
held
and
bear
in
mind
that
this
plan
has
been
through
the
mail
twice.
it
went
through
the
mail
once
in
1962,
it
went
up
to
the
appellate
court
and
came
back
and
the
same
plan
has
been
through
the
mail
again.
so
we've
had
two
evaluation
hearings,
one
in
1962
and
another
one
in
1965
and
the
trustees
–
and
the
court
found
that
the
company
in
1965
had
not
been
making
as
much
money
as
it
had
before
the
previous
evaluation
hearings
and
so
it
said
that
if
it
had
to
make
another
finding
of
going
concern
value
it
would
be
less
now
than
it
was
at
that
time.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
unsecured
creditors
had
originally
about
three
3,200,000
and
the
preferred
and
secured
2,200,000.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right.
now
we
converted
--
one
of
the
compromises
was
to
convert
$5,574,000
of
the
alleged
secured
claims
of
merrill-stevens
over
in
to
the
unsecured
class,
that
was
the
compromise
and
reduce
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
all
of
he
unsecured
creditors,
got
all
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
didn't
get
any,
now
since
you've
asked
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i'll
go
into
that
now
because
it's
important.
this
is
the
simplest
most
equitable
plan
of
reorganization
you
can
think
of.
i
can't
think
of
a
simpler
one.
i've
outlined
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
claims.
in
the
plan
of
reorganization
since
debtor
is
obviously
insolvent,
all
the
new
common
stock
is
given
the
unsecured
or
common
creditors
in
proportion
to
their
claims,
when
we
got
through
converting
some
of
them
to
--
in
compromising
some
of
them
over
to
unsecured
they
total
about
three
million,
seven
or
eight
thousand
dollars.
so
the
company
is
turned
over
to
its
unsecured
creditors
and
they
swap
their
claims
for
the
common
stock
prorata
and
the
secured
creditors
and
the
preferred
creditors
are
all
paid
all
in
cash
and
your
honors
they
have
been
paid
off
in
cash.
they
have
been
paid
off
in
cash.
this
plan
has
been
consummated
substantially.
all
the
preferred
creditors
and
all
the
secured
creditors
have
been
paid.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
$574,000
of
it
was
and
it's
compromise
was
to
convert
it
to
unsecured
and
it
has
been
paid
in
stock.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir,
out
of
the
$1,600,000
claim,
roughly
1
million
of
it
was
unsecured
from
the
beginning
and
nearly
600,000
was
preferred.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
capital
and
mortgage
claim
of
330,000
plus
interest,
costs,
attorneys
fees
and
everything
was
settled
for
$250,000
in
cash
and
the
250,000
has
been
paid
to
it.
that's
the
plan,
it's
a
simpler
plan
as
you
can
think
of
and
that
is
the
plan
that
they
were
trying
to
sustain
here,
to
turn
this
company
over
its
common
creditor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
sir,
the
company
is
insolvent
so
they
have
no
equity
in
it
and
no
right
to
participate
and
since
the
company
is
hopelessly
insolvent
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
another
issue,
that's
an
entirely
different
issue.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
a
little
over
two
years,
two
and
a
half
years
at
the
most.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
your
honor
rather,
rather
amazing.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
it
had
it
had
a
lot
of
stockholders.
at
the
time
the
reorganization
proceeding
began
there
were
a
lot
of
stockholders
that
bought
the
stock
on
the
open
market.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
it
was
--
most
of
it
was
issued
to
persons
in
payment
for
services
and
materials
and
supplies
and
equipment
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
some
of
it
was
issued
for
cash
and
sold,
very
little
of
it
was
registered.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right
very
little
of
it.
getting
into
the
--
so
closing
out
the
--
on
the
issue
of
insolvency
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
this
debtor
is
insolvent
and
i
don't
see
how
the
court
find
otherwise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
only
some
of
them,
when
i
come
to
discussing
the
compromises
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
weren't
though,
we
decided
that
they
--
we
pursued
some
of
it,
we
pursued
we
filed
two
suits
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
principal
ones
they
are
complaining
about
are
the
counter
claims
against
the
claims
of
merrill-stevens
and
the
captain
mortgage.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
right
i
do.
one
more
point
on
that
insolvency,
if
you
wiped
out
--
your
honor
if
you
wiped
out
those
claims
entirely,
you
wiped
out
those
two
claims
entirely
nearly
$2,000,000
worth,
the
company
would
still
be
insolvent.
the
fact
of
insolvency
is
the
most
important
fact
here
because
these
stockholders
have
got
no
right
to
complaint
against
the
compromise
of
these
claims,
because
they
have
no
equity
in
them,
the
compromise
is
of
concern
only
to
the
creditors.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
it
is
my
opinion
your
honor
that
if
you
took
every
favorable
factor
that
they
have,
i
still
don't
believe
it
would
be
solvent
because
you'd
have
to
add
interest
to
those
claims
and
if
you
took
their
experts
most
favorable
one,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
solvent,
i'll
go
into
the
rest
of
it
tomorrow.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
--
the
issued
that
i
will
discuss
first
this
morning
is
the
issue
concerning
the
employment
of
the
trustee
by
the
reorganized
company.
the
success
of
the
trustee
in
operating
the
business
of
a
data
is
best
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
when
he
took
over
in
november
of
1959
--
1957,
almost
exactly
10
years
ago,
business
was
at
a
stand
still.
the
ships
were
not
moving.
they
were
in
bad
need
of
repair
and
there
was
little
hope
for
the
business
so
everyone
thought.
under
his
able
management,
the
business
grew
to
the
point
where
by
1964,
the
end
of
the
--
or
1965,
when
we
began
by
the
end
of
1965,
when
we
began
to
consummate
the
present
plan
of
reorganization,
the
business
was
able
to
pay
off
in
cash
over
$1,500,000
in
claims
being
all
of
the
preferred
claims
and
all
of
the
secured
claims.
of
this
sum,
about
$1,100,000
went
to
the
united
states
government
for
its
tax
and
nontax
claims.
and
of
--
and
$250,000
went
to
the
--
to
pay
off
the
caplan
mortgage,
the
compromise
of
the
caplan
mortgage
claim.
this
--
the
payment
of
this
large
sum
of
money
to
pay
off
all
of
these
claimants
in
these
two
categories,
did
not
come
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
business.
most
of
it
came
from
a
loan
of
$1,250,000
that
the
reorganized
company
was
permitted
by
the
court
to
make
from
a
bank
in
florida,
a
long-term
loan
which
reorg
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
rest
of
it
came
out
of
the
earnings.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
total
of
the
claims
was
--
in
excess
of
$1,500,000,
so
of
that
sum
approximately
between
$250,000
and
$300,000
came
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
data.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
earnings
had
been
a
great
deal
more
than
that.
most
of
the
earnings
had
been
plowed
back
in
to
the
business
to
purchase
new
or
purchase
more
lst's.
when
the
trustees
took
over,
they
were
operating
only
three
of
these
old
world
war
ii
lst's.
during
his
tenure,
they
have
purchased
and
converted
two
more
of
the
lst's
so
they're
operating
five.
and
most
of
the
earnings
of
the
business
during
that
period
of
time
had
to
be
plowed
back
into
additional
assets.
so
it
was
inevitable,
almost
inevitable
that
persons
who
were
interested
in
inquiring
this
company
upon
reorganization
would
want
to
retain
the
services
of
--
the
good
services
of
this
trustee,
and
so
it
was
has
it
been
emphasized
in
all
of
the
briefs.
all
of
the
plans
of
reorganization
have
contemplated
the
retention
of
the
services
of
this
trustee.
the
present
plan
of
reorganization,
this
internal
plan
which
i
have
described
to
the
court,
was
prepared
by
the
committee
appointed
by
the
district
judge
to
represent
the
unsecured
creditors
as
a
class.
this
committee
--
the
larger
creditors
of
course
were
represented
by
their
own
counsel.
and
so
the
court
appended
a
committee
of
two
experienced
local
attorneys
to
represent
the
general
mass
of
the
unsecured
creditors.
and
this
committee
presented
and
suggested
this
internal
plan
of
reorganization
which
included
the
two
compromises
of
the
claims
that
are
among
the
issues
here
and
also
included
a
provision
which
contemplated
the
retention
of
the
trustee's
management
by
the
reorganized
company.
it
did
not
require
the
retention
of
that
management.
it
merely
permitted
it
and
put
everyone
on
notice
that
though
--
the
proponents
of
the
plan
contemplated
the
possible
retention
of
the
trustee
and
his
good
management
team.
now,
our
first
point
of
course
is
that
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
preclude
the
employment
of
the
trustee
and
all
of
the
recorded
cases
thus
far,
that
have
touched
on
this
subject
have
permitted
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
or
rather
more
accurately
stated,
cases
as
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
they
have
cited
to
the
court
instances
where
the
trustee
has
been
retained
or
employed
by
a
reorganized
company.
and
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
decisions
where
that
has
been
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
appears
to
us
that
the
matter
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
under
section
221
(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
simply
requires
a
complete
disclosure
of
the
identity,
qualifications
and
affiliations
of
the
persons
who
are
to
be
the
initial
directors
and
officers
of
the
reorganized
company
and
the
finding
that
their
appointment
by
the
court
would
be
compatible
with
the
interest
of
the
data
and
consistent
with
public
policy.
we
think
this
is
a
finding
of
fact
to
be
made
in
each
case.
it
has
been
made
in
this
case
by
the
district
judge
that
this
trustee's
retention
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
data.
the
opposing
contention
is
based
upon
an
interpretation
of
sections
156
and
158
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
pertain
to
the
appointment
of
a
disinterested
trustee.
but
nothing
in
those
statutes
asses
or
implies
that
an
interest
in
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
is
a
disqualification
to
act
as
trustee.
opposing
counsel
would
write
into
the
statute
a
meaning
that
is
not
stated.
their
position
is
not
sound
and
presupposes
that
a
trustee
will
necessarily
breach
his
trust
if
he
contemplates
continuation
of
his
employment.
this
is
contrary
to
human
experience
or
a
person
with
an
incentive
will
do
a
better
job
than
one
who
knows
that
his
services
will
be
terminated
no
matter
how
well
he
performs.
opposing
argument
of
opposing
counsel
of
course
overlooks
the
benefits
to
the
data
of
being
able
to
retain
the
services
of
a
good
and
successful
trustee.
it
also
overlooks
the
fact
that
all
of
the
trustee's
actions
are
subject
to
court
approval.
the
criticism
that
you
have
heard
here
yesterday
expressed
of
this
trustee
and
the
things
that
he
did
involve
matters
that
were
all
approved
by
the
court.
for
example,
the
towing
contract,
the
award
of
a
towing
contract
was
criticized
and
the
recommendation
of
the
compromise
of
these
two
large
claims
was
criticized.
but
both
of
those
matters
have
been
the
subject
of
many
hearings
in
court
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
all
parties
and
throughout
this
proceeding.
that
has
been
true
with
respect
to
all
actions
of
the
trustee.
they
have
been
subjected
to
a
great
deal
of
scrutiny,
a
great
deal
of
criticism
by
the
stockholders
committee.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
trustee
is
a
retired
successful
merchant.
for
many
years,
he
was
a
manager
of
a
large
retail
department
store
and
a
successful
reputable
businessman
in
miami.
he'd
lived
in
miami
for
many
years.
he'd
been
associated
with
large
department
stores.
this
is
well-known
in
the
community.
he'd
retired
and
the
court
appointed
him
as
trustee.
he'd
had
no
interest
or
knowledge
of
tmt
at
all
before
that.
he'd
been
in
the
--
he's
just
a
good
businessman
and
he
brought
to
the
trusteeship
with
him
the
man
that
had
been
his
general
manager
and
right-hand
man
in
the
retail
merchandizing
business,
mr.
(inaudible),
who
brought
a
great
deal
of
know-how
and
sound
business
methods
to
this
trusteeship.
it
would
appear
that
opposing
counsel
would
write
into
the
bankruptcy
act
something
that
congress
has
not
written
into
it.
and
i
think
it
was
admitted
yesterday
that
in
1948
or
1958,
the
sec
sponsored
enacting
congress
that
would
have
expressly
prohibited
the
employment
of
a
trustee
for
a
period
of
two
years
after
the
conclusion
of
reorganization
proceedings
and
it
would
appear
that
the
sec
knows
that
congress
has
not
yet
prohibited
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
so
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
placed
a
proper
construction
on
the
statutes
involved
here
when
it
held
that
the
proponents
of
the
plan
that
that
--
what
the
--
the
dis
--
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
trustee
is
not
disinterested
unless
the
proponents
of
the
plan
assured
him
of
emoluments
and
security
rather
than
merely
nominating
him
for
approval
by
the
court
and
subject
to
the
usual
control
of
the
board
of
directors.
now,
one
of
the
most
imp
--
significant
factors
in
this
whole
issue
is
that,
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
disqualify
this
trustee
because
of
his
interest
in
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
or
for
any
other
reason.
if
the
position
of
opposing
counsel
is
correct,
this
trustee
has
been
disqualified
since
early
1959
for
that
was
the
first
time
when
a
plan
of
reorganization
was
proposed
that
contemplated
his
employment.
every
plan
has
contemplated
his
employment
since
early
1959.
so
we
say
to
the
court
that
it
is
too
late
now
to
urge
that
his
past
disqualification
prohibits
him
from
being
employed
in
the
future.
the
plan
has
been
substantially
consummated.
new
directors
have
taken
over
the
operations
of
the
business
and
are
running
the
company
with
this
trustee
in
his
team
in
charge
of
operations.
it
would
be
highly
inequitable
to
re
--
now
require
the
reorganized
company
to
fire
him
and
force
him
--
enforce
it
to
employ
a
less
qualified
person
to
run
the
business.
we
say
that
the
petitioner
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
are
now
estopped
to
raise
this
question
after
having
permitted
the
trustee
for
eight
years
to
operate
the
business
of
this
data,
knowing
all
that
time
that
he
was
being
considered
for
employment
by
the
reorganized
company
without
coming
in
and
specifically
asking
the
court
to
remove
him
for
that
reason.
another
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is,
that
this
issue
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
1964
decision
when
this
plan
of
reorganization
was
first
reviewed
by
that
court.
you
recall
it
has
been
reviewed
twice
and
we're
here
after
the
second
review.
the
very
provisions
of
the
plan
that
are
here
now
were
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
1964
and
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
those
provisions
in
the
plan
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
therefore,
that
decision
became
the
law
of
the
case
for
no
appeal
was
taken
from
it.
and
we
say
that
this
court
should
now
recognize
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
law
of
the
case
on
the
question
of
the
trustee's
employment
as
it
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1964.
when
the
fifth
circuit
sent
the
plan
back
in
1964,
it
sent
it
back
only
to
determine
its
feasibility
in
the
light
of
the
companion
decision
which
it
made
in
another
case
requiring
payment
in
full
of
the
government
nontax
claims.
these
claims
amounted
to
$900,000
so
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
the
data
would
be
able
to
do
it.
but
by
means
of
this
bank
loan
that
i
referred
to
a
while
ago,
the
$1,250,000
borrowed
in
that
amount
of
money,
the
data
was
able
to
pay
the
government
nontax
claims
in
full
as
well,
as
i
have
said,
all
other
preferred
and
secured
claims.
so
the
plan
of
reorganization
that
we
now
have
before
us,
the
amended
plan
is
amended
only
in
one
particular,
one
material
particular:
that
is
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
nontax
claims
of
the
government
in
full.
it
was
not
amended
in
any
particular
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee.
and
the
amended
plan
that
we
have
here
now
approves
the
appointment
of
the
same
officers
and
directors
of
the
reorganized
company
as
the
first
plan
did
back
in
1964
when
it
first
went
to
the
appellate
court.
now
the
court
well
knows
that
the
law
of
the
case
is
a
salutary
one
designed
to
end
litigation.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
and
other
courts,
it
should
be
recognized
and
followed,
unless
there
are
impelling
reasons
for
reversing
the
former
decision.
on
the
contrary
in
this
case,
there
are
impelling
reasons
for
allowing
it
to
stand.
number
one,
there's
been
no
effort
to
remove
the
trustee,
as
i
have
pointed
out.
number
two,
the
creditors,
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
here,
want
to
retain
the
trustee.
not
a
single
creditor,
not
one,
has
come
forward
to
object
to
the
employment
of
the
trustee
by
the
reorganized
company.
these
creditors
of
course
are
now
the
new
stockholders,
the
new
owners
of
the
reorganized
company.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
urged
to
the
district
court
the
approval
of
his
appointment
or
his
being
a
director
and
the
president
of
the
reorganized
company.
third,
substantial
consummation
of
this
plan
has
taken
place
as
i
have
previously
described
to
this
court.
and
it
would
certainly
serve
no
useful
purpose
in
this
case
to
prohibit
his
future
employment
because
of
a
--
an
alleged
statutory
pass
disqualification
to
serve
his
trustee.
and
finally,
it
is
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
district
court
so
found
that
the
best
interest
of
the
reorganized
company
require
to
re
--
they
require
the
retention
of
the
valuable
services
of
the
trustee
and
his
management
team.
i
would
like
to
--
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
on
that
point,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
next
point.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
asserted
time
and
time
again
in
pleadings
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i'd
have
to
put
it
this
way.
at
no
point
did
--
has
anybody
raised
any
of
these
things
as
it
faces
for
disqualifying
the
trustee
as
trustee.
they
keep
raising
them
in
this
litigation
through
the
years
as
a
reason
why
he
should
not
be
retained
or
employed
by
the
reorganized
company.
but
not
as
a
re
--
this
is
what's
inconsistent
about
the
whole
thing.
at
no
point
have
they
said,
and
i
think
counsel
for
the
sec
admitted
that
in
response
to
a
question
yesterday
that
they
had
not
raised
the
question
about
his
qualifications
as
trustee.
they
say
just
as
a
matter
of
prophylactic
rule
they
say,
that
he
shouldn't
be
retained
by
the
reorganized
company.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
because
there
was
never
any
issue
presented
to
the
court
on
it.
it
was
asserted
from
time
to
time.
it
was
asserted
that
the
trustee
for
example,
for
some
reason
favored
the
towing
company
that
he
recommended
that
the
towing
contract
was
awarded
to
that
that
the
fact
that
he
awarded
the
--
recommended
the
award
of
the
contract
without
competitive
bidding
or
something
like
that,
indicated
that
he
favored
that
company
as
against
maybe
somebody
else.
and
these
things
were
asserted
but
--
well
that
particular
issue
was
heard
in
connection
with
the
towing
contract
and
overruled.
the
court
approved
the
award
of
the
towing
contract
to
the
company
recommended
by
the
trustee.
that's
the
way
these
things
came
up.
on
individual
issues
and
actions
of
the
trustee,
they
would
object
to
him
and
the
court
would
enter
an
order.
and
in
no
time
was
a
clear
cut
issue
presented
to
the
court
that
the
trustee
was
disqualified.
the
next
issue
is
the
--
that
i
will
discuss
is
the
matter
of
the
compromise
of
the
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
now,
when
this
plan
came
back
from
the
appellate
court
in
1964
and
the
appellate
court
had
held
that
that
this
$900,000,
a
nontax
claim
to
the
government
had
to
be
paid
in
full
in
cash.
it
posed
a
real
practical
problem.
in
addition
--
because
in
addition
to
this
$1
million
--
actually
$1
million
one
--
$1,200,000
in
tax
and
preferred
claims
that
had
to
be
paid
in
cash.
there
were
these
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
i'm
adding
to
approximately
a
million
dollars.
well
something
had
to
give
or
it
would
not
be
able
to
work
out
a
plan
of
reorganization.
so,
it
was
inevitable
that
settlement
discussion
would
take
place
with
respect
to
these
lien
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
two
largest
lien
claims
were
the
ones
in
controversy
here.
the
caplan
mortgage
was
in
the
principal
sum
of
$330,000
and
it
was
a
preferred
ship
mortgage
on
all
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
other
lien
claim
was
the
$574,000
lien
--
series
of
lien
claims
again
--
by
merrill-stevens
against
all
of
the
vessels
of
the
data.
so
with
the
approval
of
the
court
and
the
knowledge
of
everyone
concerned,
settlement
discussions
took
place
between
the
trustee,
the
trustee's
counsel
and
counsel
for
these
creditors.
and
the
result
was
that
when
this
creditors
committee
proposed
the
present
internal
plan
of
reorganization,
that
plan
included
in
it
as
an
integral
part
the
proposed
compromises
of
these
two
claims.
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
of
base
amount
of
$330,000,
which
had
added
to
it
interest,
cost
and
attorney's
fees
which
would
have
make
it
at
least
$500,000,
was
reduced
to
$250,000
payable
in
cash.
and
that
--
and
in
connection
with
the
consummation
of
the
plan
that
has
taken
place,
that
$250,000
has
been
paid
to
the
caplan
mortgage
trustees.
the
only
other
fact
in
that
compromise
was
that
the
interest
due
--
accrued
interest
due
on
that
mortgage
was
paid
against
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company
or
satisfied
by
giving
them
common
stock.
now,
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
lien
claims
against
the
vessel
amounted
to
$574,000
and
the
compromised
with
merrill-stevens
provided
that
those
claims
would
be
taken
off
of
the
vessels
entirely
and
that
amount
would
become
an
unsecured
claim
payable
in
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company.
and
that
was
the
settlement
there.
the
result
of
these
two
compromises
meant
that
the
plan
was
feasible;
that
instead
of
having
to
pay
up
perhaps
puts
to
a
million
dollars
or
satisfied
puts
to
a
million
dollars
in
lien
claims
of
preferred
ship
mortgage
claims
against
the
vessels
of
the
data.
the
data
would
only
have
to
pay
$250,000
and
the
balance
in
the
common
stock
of
the
reorganized
company
which
it
didn't
cost
him
anything
in
cash.
and
as
a
result
of
these
compromises,
the
plan
was
made
feasible.
now,
the
objections
to
the
compromises
are,
the
sec
states
in
its
brief
that
the
record
contains
insufficient
facts
for
the
court
to
form,
to
make
an
informed
judgment
of
--
on
the
merits
of
the
compromise.
the
petitioner,
the
stockholders
committee,
in
addition
says
there
was
inadequate
investigation
of
the
objections
to
these
two
claims.
now
neither
of
these
contentions
is
sustained
by
the
record.
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
the
caplan
mortgage
claim
and
the
terrific
investigation
that
was
made
of
it.
it's
stated
in
our
brief
and
mr.
spitzer
represents
the
caplan
mortgage
people
and
will
go
into
the
details
of
that
during
his
time
before
the
court
when
i
finish.
but,
with
respect
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
the
numerous
pleadings
and
places
in
the
record
where
the
facts
concerning
this
claim
and
particularly
the
objections
to
it
are
set
forth
in
great
detail
particularly
by
opposing
counsel.
and
insofar
as
investigation
is
concerned,
the
record
shows
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
no
less
than
four
investigations
were
made
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
to
a
trustee's
investigation
in
1959
which
he
reported
in
his
opinion,
the
amount
of
the
claim
and
so
far
the
value
of
merrill-stevens
services
was
concerned
was
substantially
awarded
or
justified.
admittedly,
that
wasn't
much
of
an
investigation.
we
don't
have
much
in
the
record
on
it.
the
next
investigation
was
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigation
in
1961,
and
they
reported
that
rather
thoroughly
to
the
court
and
to
--
in
his
own
record.
the
stockholders
committee
made
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
recommended
--
they
reported
that
their
investigation
--
they
had
very
little
criticism
of
the
amount
of
the
claim.
bear
in
mind
that
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
was
$1,600,000
and
there
is
little
objection
to
the
fact
that
merrill-stevens
did
perform
extensive
work
on
the
vessel
and
for
which
it
was
not
paid.
and
there's
little
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
the
claim.
but
the
sec
objections
stated
that
merrill-stevens
did
not
--
the
main
objections
are
--
with
respect
to
the
million
dollar
claim
against
the
carib
queen
for
rebuilding
the
carib
queen,
merrill-stevens
did
not
properly
convert
the
vessel.
they
did
not
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
contract.
they
did
not
properly
repair
the
vessel
and
they
fail
to
establish
the
value
of
its
work
and
materials.
and
in
addition,
the
petitioner
in
its
charges
against
--
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim,
repeated
what
the
sec
had
said
and
went
on
to
say
to
charge
that
merrill-stevens
is
liable
in
thought
for
negligence
in
performing
the
work
on
the
vessel
causing
in
part
the
downfall
of
tmt.
they
also
charged
that
merrill-stevens
bought
stock
in
tmt
for
which
it
has
not
been
paid.
and
that
is
a
substance
of
the
charges
that
they
made
against
merrill-stevens.
merrill-stevens
filed
pleadings
denying
all
of
these.
and
in
addition
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigation
and
the
stockholders
committee
investigation,
the
trustee
or
rather
--
our
firm,
as
counsel
for
the
trustee,
took
all
of
these
information
that
was
made
available
to
us
by
the
sec
and
the
stockholders
committee
and
by
merrill-stevens
and
made
an
off-the-record
investigation
of
all
of
these
things
just
as
attorneys
always
do
in
connect
--
when
the
question
of
settlement
of
a
claim
is
being
considered.
we
studied
all
of
these
and
reported
to
the
court
that
--
as
follows,
two
attorneys
in
the
office
of
counsel
for
the
trustee
have
examined
the
factual
data,
gathered
in
the
trustee's
investigation
of
the
objections
to
the
merrill-stevens
claim.
and
it
is
the
considered
opinion
of
both
attorneys
that
the
possibility
is
remote
of
obtaining
any
reduction
or
material
reduction
in
the
amount
of
the
merrill-stevens
claim
by
litigating
the
objections
against
it.
trial
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
objections
would
be
time
consuming
and
would
result
in
unnecessary
delay
in
formulating
a
plan
of
reorganization.
that
is
our
considered
judgment
of
this
compromise
as
attorneys
for
the
trustee.
and
i
say
to
the
court
and
all
candidates,
one
thing
to
sit
up
in
your
office
and
prepare
pleadings
and
make
objections
and
file
fraud
charges.
but
it's
quite
another
thing
when
you're
on
the
firing
line
and
have
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
you're
going
to
file
a
lawsuit
by
the
claim
or
compromise
it
on
a
reasonable
basis.
and
we
advise
the
trustee
and
we
advise
the
court
that
this
compromise
should
be
accepted
and
the
court
accepted
our
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
and
that's
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
expressly,
the
--
bear
in
mind
that
the
proposed
compromises
were
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization.
and
therefore,
the
hearings
--
the
extensive
hearings
that
were
held
on
two
different
occasions
in
1962
and
in
1965
again,
on
the
merits
of
the
plan
whether
it
should
be
approved
or
not,
are
the
hearings
that
involved
everything
in
connection
with
the
plan,
including
these
objections.
and
our
report
to
the
court
on
this
was
--
came
out
in
there.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
we
had
--
no
evidence
was
taken
on
it.
we
had
in
these
investigation
reports
and
--
in
the
record,
sufficient
facts
to
show
on
the
one
hand
what
the
basis
of
merrill-stevens
claim
was
and
on
the
other
hand,
what
the
basis
of
the
objections
were
and
no
evidence
was
taken.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
stockholders
committee
kept
yelling
for
more
investigation,
more
investigation.
we
did
not
think
more
investigation
was
necessary.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
may
have.
but
in
the
meantime,
none
was
necessary
because
the
creditors
committee
had
proposed
the
compromises
and
we'd
recommended
the
approval
of
the
compromises
and
we
didn't
think
that
any
good
would
come
of
any
hearings
on
the
objection.
we
didn't
think
we
had
to
get
in
and
upheld
the
facts
before
the
court
and
try
the
thing
--
before
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
approval
of
the
compromise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
this
court
has
held
and
the
law
seems
to
be
clear
that
you
don't
have
to
hear
objections
to
a
claim,
parti
--
where
the
settlement
of
that
claim
is
proposed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
hearings
on
the
feasibility
and
the
fairness
and
so
forth
of
the
plan
that
are
held
in
--
are
the
hearings
in
which
those
matters
are
considered.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
that's
our
principal
answer.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
not
where
the
compromises
proposed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
of
reorganization
and
the
hearings
that
you
have
on
that
are
the
--
the
hearings
on
the
plan
go
into
the
whole
thing
including
the
compromise,
if
you
don't
have
any
specific
hearing
on
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
any
basis
for
a
charge
of
fraud
in
this
case,
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
hearing.
for
one
of
the
things
we
emphasize
is
that
there's
no
facts
in
this
record
to
show
that
merrill-stevens
is
guilty
of
any
fraud.
now
--
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
counsel
appeared
yesterday,
said
that
merrill-stevens
was
guilty
of
fraud
and
in
the
next
breadth
said
the
fraud
was
connected
with
sha
--
with
abrams
and
shaffer
who
wrecked
the
company.
there's
not
a
thing
in
this
record
to
connect
merrill-stevens
with
shaffer
and
abrams
or
the
caplan
mortgage
people
at
all.
that
is
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
reorganization
proceedings
in
this
thing.
there
is
no
basis
and
this
is
the
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief.
there's
no
basis
for
fraud
against
--
the
only
charges
against
merrill-stevens
are
that
they
didn't
repair
the
vessel
properly
and
are
responsible
for
it
breaking
down
at
sea
and
things
of
that
kind.
things
involving
tort
claims
against
that
which
when
we
waived
these
things,
we
decided
that
the
burden
of
proof
just
wasn't
worth
going
after,
particularly
when
the
creditors
wanted
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
your
honor,
the
court
was
interested
and
so
are
we
as
counsel
for
the
trustee.
we're
anxious
to
recover
everything
possible
for
the
debtor
in
this
particular
case.
but
we
were
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
creditors
concerned
were
anxious
for
these
--
both
of
these
compromises
to
take
place
in
order
that
the
reorganization
not
be
delayed.
and
this
was
a
very
important
factor
and
we
felt
on
--
from
our
examination
of
the
facts
and
the
dispute
and
everything
and
we
still
stand
by
it,
that
it
was
not
the
objections
to
the
claim
were
not
--
did
not
warrant
litigation
in
view
of
the
fairness
of
the
proposed
compromise.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
well,
we
argued
to
the
lower
court
that
there
were
no
basis
for
fraud
chares
that
this
was
a
factual
matter
and
we
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
breakdown
of
the
vessels
and
all
that
was
caused
by
merrill-stevens
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
vessel
was
accepted
by
the
government
authorities
and
everybody
concern
and
put
out
to
sea.
we
had
weighed
all
of
these
things
and
we
gave
the
results
of
our
weighing
of
these
matters
to
the
court.
now
this
is
a
way
cases
are
settled,
the
--
but
commonly
we
study
the
facts
and
you
report
and
recommend
to
your
client
the
basis
of
your
settlement.
we
didn't
try
to
spread
all
the
facts
and
the
reason
before
the
court
except
that
conclusion
on
the
matter.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
they
never
alleged
that
it
was
fraudulent.
they
merely
alleged
--
stated
the
objections.
they
stated
there
was
--
they'd
uncovered
evidence
to
indicate
that
merrill-stevens
was
--
may
have
been
guilty
of
negligence
or
breach
of
contract
in
some
manner
in
performing
the
work
on
these
vessels.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
we
never
tried
the
matter
except
to
consider
and
weigh
the
--
object
the
statements
that
merrill's
--
denials
of
merrill-stevens,
the
statements
on
the
other
side
and
then
the
court
considered
the
compromise
which
all
of
the
creditors
approved.
now
all
the
creditors
wanted
the
compromise
very
much.
i
think
i've
made
that
quiet
clear.
no
creditor
objected
to
the
compromise
and
the
creditors
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
they're
the
ones
who
would
benefit
by
the
compromise
or
would
benefit
by
any
recovery.
it
might
be
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
--
made
against
merrill-stevens.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
yes.
they
have
(inaudible)
and
through
here
objected
to
the
compromise,
only
on
the
basis
that
we
--
that
we
didn't
go
in
and
tried
the
thing.
now,
i
want
to
--
we
had
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
which,
what
we're
going
to
try
and
what
we're
not
going
to
try
about
all
these
claims
that
have
been
made
against
the
data.
and
i
want
to
--
my
time
is
about
up
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
are
advisers
to
the
court
and
to
the
trustee,
and
they
had
been
very
helpful
in
a
great
many
matters.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
they
--
i
don't
--
they
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
sec
here
has
made
a
kind
of
a
crusade
out
of
this
case
for
these
poor
stockholders.
we
think
that
they
should
be
just
as
concern
or
more
concerned
about
the
poor
creditors
because
creditors
come
ahead
of
stockholders.
and
we've
taken
the
position
that
the
creditors
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
they
want
these
compromises
and
they've
approved
this
plan
in
overwhelming
vote.
the
last
count
was
about
98
or
95%
approved
and
nobody
disapproved.
they
want
this
plan.
they
want
to
get
on
with
this
reorganization.
they
don't
want
to
take
the
time
and
go
back
and
fight
these
claims
out.
this
is
a
practical
matter
that
they
are
concerned
with.
i
do
want
to
conclude
by
just
pointing
out
one
thing
regarding
the
failure
of
the
trustee
to
bring
suits
to
recover
damages
against
persons
accused
of
fraudulent
practices
in
connection
with
transactions
involving
tmt
stock.
petitioner's
brief
makes
a
serious
and
unfounded
charge
against
the
trustee
and
against
me.
on
page
30
of
his
brief,
he
says
that
for
three
years
preceding
1965,
trustee's
counsel
for
that
--
in
1965,
trustee's
counsel
for
the
first
time
admitted
the
other
abandonment
of
these
suits.
now
--
and
on
page
15
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
repeats
his
charge
in
the
following
language.
the
trustee
failed
to
disclose
on
the
record
to
the
stockholders
or
creditors
or
the
sec
that
a
secret
understanding
was
actually
made
in
1962
to
suppress
the
suits
and
waive
the
setoffs.
this
was
disclosed
as
to
the
suits
for
the
first
time
in
1965.
and
what
they're
referring
to
in
1965
is
where
in
an
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
gonson
of
the
sec,
he
says
there's
a
contemplated
--
at
all
that
the
trustee
of
the
estate
would
institute
any
litigation
with
respect
to
the
caplan
mortgage
transaction
answered
by
mr.
simmons,
know
that
matter
has
been
settled
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
now,
i
want
to
refer
the
court
to
page
662
of
the
record,
in
record
number
2,
in
which
--
in
april
of
1962
when
we
were
beginning
to
consider
this
plan
of
reorganization,
this
is
the
report
that
the
trustee
and
i
made
to
the
court.
as
to
the
contention
of
the
stockholders
committee
that
there
are
causes
of
action
against
caplan
and
merrill-stevens,
which
could
result
in
recoveries
beyond
the
amount
of
the
claims,
that
trustee
has
been
advised
that
such
possibility
is
too
remote
to
warrant
the
expensive
litigation
and
to
delay
in
reorganization.
the
trustee
has
filed
two
suits
as
a
result
of
his
1960
investigation
of
the
caplan
mortgage
participants
and
others
who
had
dealings
with
the
form
of
management.
one
of
these
suits
is
against
joseph
abrams
and
others
involved
in
the
purchase
of
the
property
at
wilmington,
delaware.
the
other
is
against
eric
rath
(ph),
former
president-organizer
of
tmt,
recovers
in
these
suits
are
uncertain
amount
and
they
are
the
only
ones
considered
worthy
of
prosecution.
it
was
our
opinion
that
in
a
reorganization
case
you
have
to
look
to
the
future
and
not
to
the
past.
the
creditors
wanted
to
get
it
on
with
reorganization
and
they
did
not
want
to
waste
the
time
of
the
--
time
would
be
necessary
and
the
expense
in
prosecuting
these
all
--
suits
in
trying
to
punish
all
these
people
that
may
have
been
involved
in
the
downfall
of
tmt.
and
this
was
our
considered
judgment
and
this
was
made
a
matter
of
record
in
connection
with
the
hearings
proceeding,
the
first
consideration
of
the
plan
in
1962.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
we
got
a
judgment
against
mr.
rath
(ph),
the
ringleader
of
the
former
management
in
the
amount
of
a
$131,000
in
1963
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
collect
1-5
cent
a
piece
on
it.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
the
other
suit
is
still
pending
in
the
southern
district
court
of
new
york.
any
benefits
that
it
gets
come
under
the
plan
will
go
to
the
common
creditors
of
the
company
under
the
plan
of
reorganization.
so
far,
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
that
suit
and
so
far,
we
haven't
gotten
anywhere
with
it.
it's
not
over
with
yet,
but
we've
not
recovered
anything
with
it
enough.
now
those
are
the
two
suits
that
we
brought
and
we
considered
all
the
rest
of
them.
and
i'm
not
--
brought
anymore
because
we
didn't
feel
that
they
warranted
--
the
merits
of
them
didn't
warrant
it,
the
expense
was
not
warranted
and
the
delay
in
the
reorganization
case
was
not
warranted.
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
because
the
facts
--
no,
because
the
facts
with
respect
to
those
objections
were
well-developed
in
the
various
investigation
that
were
made
to
be
--
mr.
william
p.
simmons,
jr.
no,
they
were
no.
they
were
not.
the
rest
of
my
time
will
be
taken
--
of
our
time
will
be
taken
by
mr.
spitzer.
