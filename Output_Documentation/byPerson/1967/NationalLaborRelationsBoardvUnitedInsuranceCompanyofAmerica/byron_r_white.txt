justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
following
the
hearst
case
in
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
this
boys?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
had
congress
indicate
--
what
it
thought
about
news
boys?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
their
--
under
the
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
that
the
board's
petition
for
a
cert
has
indicated
that
this
ruling
here
would
be
significant
as
far
as
news
boys
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
might
reach
the
same
result
under
your
present
test
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
in
the
hearst
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
manoli,
congress
certainly
indicated
that
it
wasn't
satisfied
with
what
the
board
was
doing
with
employees,
he
wanted
to
amend
the
act.
and
yet,
do
you
think
the
amendment
has
made
any
difference
at
all?
you
apparently
believed
that
the
news
voice
case
is
--
a
result
from
the
news
voice
case
isn't
going
to
be
changed
under
the
new
test
and
yet
that's
what
disturbed
congress
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
that
going
to
make
any
difference
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
not
--
so
congress
didn't
want
the
courts
to
review
these
kinds
of
determinations
of
agencies
with
some
care?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
congress
disagreed
with
the
result
of
the
hearst?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
congress
disagreed
with
the
board
on
his
voice?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
--
what
if
the
legislative
history
is
that
way
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
news
voice,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
understand
the
government
to
say
that
if
the
board
is
right
in
this
case;
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
the
news
voice
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
see
their
petition
for
certiorari
suggests
about
says
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
in
the
record
to
show
the
names
of
their
compensation
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
segal,
i
gather
these
individual
debit
agents
are
not
free
to
get
any
help
themselves
in
terms
--
can
they
hire
--
are
they
free
to
hire
few
people
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
territorial
restrictions
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
one
want
to
hire
ten
people
and
go
out
if
he
could
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
he
assign
the
list
of
customers
to
collect?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
build
that
list
up
as
large
as
he
wants.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
the
board
making
careful
notes
of
your
position.
justice
byron

this
