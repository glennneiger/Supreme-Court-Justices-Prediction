no

justice

i
had
an
idea
that
we'd
had
some
life
insurance
agent
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
insurance,
life
insurance
sales
agents
were,
wasn't
it?
we
didn't
have
the
case
of
life
insurance
sales
agents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
call
them
life
insurance
agents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
was
talking
about
life
insurance,
the
life
insurance
agents
only.
justice

what
did

justice

black
what
did
they
hold?
justice

do
they
have
to
assume
that
they
were
employees
in

to
decide
in
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
raise
but
they
have
to
employees
to
be
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
was
told
like
spears
independent
contract,
definitions
that
had
been
given
to
independent
contractor
are
not
models
of
the
decision
of
such
and
such?
justice
hugo
l.
black
base
on
these
records
that
in
each,
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
have
many
adhered
this
evidence.
the
court
had
been
decided
either
way
it
wishes
under
the
common
law
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
anyone
argues
to
the
contrary
of
that
and
it
was
considered
to
rest
on
the
independent
contract
in
light
of
the
act
and
what
is
so
far
as
the
purposes
of
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
--
it
seems
to
me
actually
on
the
ground
that
common
law
independent
contractors
are
saying
that
anybody
could
know
or
could
see
it?
all
they
have
to
do
is
just
look
at
it
and
know
that
contractors
are
not
in
control?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
common
law,
as
i
recall
it,
it
had
to
do
mainly
with
tort.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
were
the
some
minor
who
is
working
in
the
mine,
was
an
independent
contractor
when
he
only
had
one
foot
of
mine
whether
he
was
an
employee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
one
of
the
main
things
which
you
had
to
consider
was
rather
this
was
a
mere
device
or
an
employer's
part
to
escape
liability
for
tort.
he
should
work
it
as
a
play.
whether
it
was
a
man
was
a
genuine
employee
of
the
company,
they
were
trying
to
conceal
it
behind
a
lot
of
camouflage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
limit
itself
to
a
precise
definition,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
piece
of
legislative
history
you
chiefly
rely
on
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
segal,
i
have
just
read
each
quotation
you
have
of
senator
taft
and
from
the
committee
report
and
from
the
other
statement.
i
get
very
little
assistance
from
it
except
they
emphasized
their
purpose
to
see
that
independent
contractors
were
treated
as
independent
contractors
and
employees
are
treated
as
employees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
you
get
out
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
that's
the
part
i
can't
get
much
of.
of
course,
it's
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
an
independent
contractor
as
we
go
over
the
statute
than
what
an
employee.
but
the
facts,
the
law
has
to
be
applied
to
the
facts.
so,
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
will
now
if
this
is
that
i
don't
have
a
good
deal
of
dealing
with
independent
contractors
and
employees
and
i
never
was
a
rule
to
try
in
anyone
definition
whereby
you
can
just
hurl
those
words
out
and
say,
“now
you
decide
whether
this
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee
as
a
matter
of
law.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
why
he
said
the
nlrb
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
able
to
give
a
definition
now,
the
common
law
difference
between
an
independent
contractor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
all
of
it,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
all
of
it,
could
it?
because
they
might
just
let
some
employee
control
three
or
four
employees
around
him,
that
would
be
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
quite
a
number
of
facts
and
circumstances
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
than
the
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
the

what

oh
--
justice

how
about

justice

well,
how

i
understood
you
to

that
they
could
employ
other
people
to
do
their
work.
justice

black
they
pick
on
bad
people?
justice

i
can't
believe
that!
justice

black
well,
that's
what
i
would
suppose.

that

did?
justice

deny
they
did
not

so
he
hold
it
justified
falsely

saying,
they
own

justice

as
i
understand
it,
the
evidence
does
not
so
much
in

mr.

would

was

examination

statement
about

the

pays
social
