mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
right
here
and
now,
i
should
like
to
sever
the
connection
which
my
friends
this
morning
have
built
between
them
and
me.
they
have
said,
mr.
manoli,
yesterday
that
there
is
no
significant
dispute
as
to
facts.
mr.
manoli
said
there
was
no
significant
dispute
as
to
the
scope
of
review
or
as
to
the
definition.
and
this
morning,
i
hear
from
my
friend,
mr.
groner
that
there
is
no
significant
dispute
between
us,
as
to
the
meaning
of
congress,
as
to
what
happened
to
the
hearst
act,
as
to
whether
news
voice
are
or
are
not
covered.
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
in
the
words
of
the
famous
author,
“methinks
my
lady
doth
protest
too
loudly.”
the
fact
is,
that
of
course
there
are
very,
very
substantial
differences
between
us.
the
fact
is,
as
we
apprehend
the
law,
congress
intended
very
specific
and
very
positive
and
very
definite
results.
mr.
manoli
said
yesterday
that
in
his
view,
the
only
time
that
the
economic
realities
came
into
effect,
mind
with
you
the
hearst
case,
was
when
there
was
a
taft
case
that
in
the
easy
case
you
apply
the
law
of
agency.
and
in
the
taft
case,
and
i
quoted
exactly,
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute,
“tilt
the
scales”.
i
suggest,
your
honors,
if
that
is
true,
congress
achieve
nothing.
mr.
groner,
this
morning,
said
categorically,
mr.
manoli
said
this
morning
categorically
that
this
determination
is
not
one
of
law.
if
that
is
true,
your
honors,
then
senator
taft
was
completely
in
error
when
he
defined
for
the
congress
what
the
conference
report
achieved.
my
friends
say
that
they
have
not
departed
from
the
test.
let
me
read,
in
addition
to
the
portion
of
the
brief
that
mr.
justice
fortas
so
aptly
referred
to,
namely
the
footnote
and
other
part
of
the
brief
on
page
19.
the
determination
whether
an
individual
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor
thus
allows
considerable
room
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
and
discretion
tests
which
the
board,
with
its
wide
experience
in
handling
cases,
involving
different
hiring
relationships
is
a
specially
competent
to
perform.
then
we
skip
down
to
the
middle
of
the
page,
middle
of
the
sentence,
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
the
way
to
be
assigned
them
“are
so
infinite
and
subtle
that
of
necessity
a
large
major
of
informed
discretion”.
“so
infinite
and
subtle”
instead
of
so
simple
as
we
were
told
this
morning
that
of
necessity
at
large
and
measurable
of
informed
discretion
is
involved
in
the
exercise
by
the
board
of
its
primary
function
to
determine
whether
an
individual
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee.
and
then
comes
something,
which
i
don't
want
to
take
time
with
the
moment
for,
but
the
board
then
says
that
the
test
--
that
the
court
must
apply
is
warrant
in
the
record
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
law.
that
again
was
hearst
and
that
was
overruled
by
universal
camera
but
i'll
come
to
that
later.
and
then
i
come
to
the
footnote
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
and
i
see
where
the
board
feels
that
where
respondeat
superior,
which
is
what
congress
said
was
to
be
the
test,
the
same
test
that
has
been
applied
there.
that
where
that
is
not
involved,
the
subsequent
infusion
of
flexibility.
this
is
something
new
in
the
law
of
independent
contractor,
the
subsequent
infusion
of
flexibility
into
the
relevant
standard.
something
else
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
determining
employment
status
is
a
especially
appropriate
where
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is
not
to
decide
the
applicability
of
respondeat
superior
liability
but
to
determine
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
well,
that's
all
the
congress
was
dealt
with
if
it
–
dealing
with
if
it
please
the
court,
that's
the
coverage
of
the
national
relations
act.
now,
let
me
just
read
to
your
honors,
if
i
may,
and
i
have
not
intended
to
take
your
time
with
this,
two
excerpts,
one
from
the
house
committee
report
which
originated
the
language
and
the
other
from
senator
taft
in
explaining
to
the
senate
why
he
recommended
that
they
adopt
the
conference
report.
the
house
report
says,
“an
employee,
according
to
all
standard
dictionaries,
according
to
the
law
as
the
court
have
stated,
and
according
to
the
understanding
of
almost
everyone,
with
the
exception
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
means
“someone
who
works
for
another
for
hire.”
but
in
the
case
of
nlrb
against
hearst,
the
board
expanded
the
term
“employee”
beyond
anything
it
ever
had
included
before.
and
the
supreme
court,
relying
on
the
theoretic
expertness
of
the
board,
upheld
the
board.
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress,
when
it
passed
the
act,
authorized
the
board
to
give
to
every
word
in
the
act
whatever
meaning
it
wishes.
on
the
contrary,
congress
intended
then
and
it
intends
now
that
the
board
gives
to
words
not
farfetched
meanings
but
ordinary
measures,
ordinary
meanings.
to
correct
what
the
board
has
done
and
what
the
supreme
court
putting
misplaced
reliance
upon
the
board's
expertness
has
approved
the
bill
excludes
independent
contract
and
so
on.
and
what
does
mr.
senator
taft
do
to
my
friend's
argument
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
law?
“the
legal
effect
of
the
amendment
therefore”
he
says,
that
the
congress,
in
presenting
the
conference
report,
necessary
an
official
position,
“is
merely
to
make
it
clear
that
the
question
whether
or
not
a
person
is
an
employee
is
always
a
question
of
law,
always
a
question
of
law.”
since
the
term
is
not
meant
to
embrace
persons
outside
that
category
under
the
general
principles
of
the
law
of
agency.
excuse
me.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
you
have
a
question
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
an
act
which
involves
independent
contractors,
if
you
have
a
question
of
representation,
as
to
the
representation
question,
as
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
question,
do
regard
as
had
for
the
act.
but
when
you
get
to
the
independent
contractor,
then
as
we
say
the
controlling
principle
must
be
the
law
of
agency.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
precisely
what
we
meant
to
say,
your
honor,
that
nevertheless
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
we
say
never
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
nevertheless,
agency
principles
constitute
the
controlling
test.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
groner
was
saying,
your
honor,
that
this
is
never
a
question
of
law.
senator
taft
says
it
is
always
a
question
of
law.
mr.
groner
--
mr.
manoli
says
that
in
a
closed
case,
agency
principles
are
departed
from
and
you
look
only
at
the
purposes
of
the
act.
we
say
that
while
the
framework
is
the
act,
the
controlling
principle
must
be
agency
law.
certainly,
that's
what
we
intended
to
say,
that's
what
we
thought
we
said
that
we
didn't.
it
isn't
what
we
intended.
now,
i
address
myself
to
a
question,
several
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
and
that
is
what
the
senate
thought
as
to
the
specific
issue
of
this
case,
namely
the
newspaper
drivers.
i
may
say
that
in
the
back
of
our
brief
as
appendix
a,
we
have
drawn
three
columns,
four
columns
really.
the
first
are
the
items
that
were
considered
by
courts.
the
second
contains
the
items
which
the
courts
have
felt
important
as
to
united's
agents.
but,
of
course,
we
say
that
there
is
no
generic
debit
agent.
there
are
certain
things
they
have
in
common.
there
are
great
many
things
they
have
different
from
each
other.
the
third
contains
interestingly
enough.
the
items
in
the
phoenix
mutual
case
where
the
court
below
held
that
debit
agents
were
not
independent
contractors
but
were
employees
because
they
operated
differently
from
united's
employees
and
the
court
showed
the
difference
between
those.
and
the
last
column
shows
what's
in
the
hearst
case
the
court
defined
as
the
controls
and
lack
of
controls
over
the
news
voice.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
what
the
court
--
what
the
congress
said
about
the
hearst
and
then
specifically
about
these
rather
petty
types
of
employees
as
the
board
regarded
them.
in
the
first
place,
the
house
conference
report
said
it
is
believed
that
the
provisions
of
the
conference
agreement
relating
to
the
court's
reviewing
power
will
be
adequate
to
preclude
such
decisions
as
those
in
hearst.
now,
i
don't
know
what
precluding
a
decision
like
the
one
in
hearst
can
mean
except
precluding
the
holding
of
those
news
voice
to
be
employees.
and
then
i
go
to
a
portion
of
senator
taft's
statement
and
he
said
specifically,
“while
the
board
has
never
claimed
that
independent
contractors
were
employees,
the
supreme
court
has
the
hearst
publication's
case
held
that
the
ordinary
test
of
the
law
of
agency
could
be
disregarded
by
the
board
in
determining
if
petty
occupational
groups
were
employees.”
that's
very
much
like
mr.
manoli,
in
reverse.
mr.
manoli
says
that
where
it's
a
clear
case
and
that
he
very
clearly
says
as
these
petty
occupational
groups
in
effect,
the
board's
view
has
become
today
as
i
shall
show
that
you've
got
to
be
an
independent
businessman.
that
if
it's
the
type
of
thing
that
some
people
had
employees
and
some
have
independent
contractors
that
has
fled
from
the
law.
that's
not
what
the
congress
said.
the
congress
said
that,
if
petty
groups
were
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
labors
relations
act,
the
court
consequently
refused
to
consider
the
question.
the
legal
effect
of
the
amendment,
therefore,
is
to
make
clear
and
so
on.
so
that
i
would
say
categorically,
mr.
justice
white,
that
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
congress
in
an
issue
which
is
not
constitutional
in
character
but
merely
involves
what
it
wants
words
to
mean,
obviously,
it
could
use
any
word
and
define
as
it
pleases
and
this
court,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
bound
by
it.
the
congress
in
an
issue
not
involving
constitutional
questions
has
said,
the
court
has
played
mistaken,
has
paid
mistaken
difference
to
the
board.
this
is
a
question
where
the
court's
expertise,
where
the
long
list
of
cases
to
which
mr.
justice
black
referred,
whatever
may
have
been
the
issues
in
those
cases
have
established
the
law
of
independent
agency,
you
cannot
say
that
economic
realities
make
it
so
that
if
there's
a
right
of
termination,
if
the
status
is
not
a
lofty
status,
if
it's
not
an
independent
business,
will
no
longer
regard
it
as
an
independent
contractor.
and
i
can
see
the
reason
why
the
board
says
that.
the
board
says
that
because
its
function
is
to
extend
coverage,
to
extend
coverage.
congress
has
said,
it
extended
it
too
far.
now,
we
are
going
to
put
a
stop
in
this
one
respect.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor.
i
only
rely
on
two
things,
and
there
are
only
two
significant
ones.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
one
is
the
house
report
because
the
house
originated
the
language.
the
senate,
originally,
did
not.
then
in
the
conference,
senator
taft
and
the
senate
conferees
went
along
with
the
house
definition.
and
so,
the
second
thing
i
rely
on
is
the
conference
report,
house
and
senate,
and
senator
taft's
explanation
to
the
congress
of
what
the
conference
report
achieved
and
so
we
quote
the
house
report
and
we
quote
senator
taft
statement.
and
i
may
say
that
the
amicus
brief
quotes
further
portions
of
both.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
has
to
be,
your
honor.
if
you
will
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and,
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
this
tabulation
we've
shown,
you
will
find
fewer
controls
in
the
debit
agent
case
than
were
present
in
the
news
voice
case.
now,
i
address
myself
factually
to
a
statement
by
mr.
manoli.
he
says
there
is,
and
i
quote
him
exactly,
he
said
yesterday,
“there
is
really
no
significant
dispute
as
to
the
basic
facts.”
and
that
is
what
the
brief
says
for
the
government,
for
the
board
that
is
what
the
union
brief
says
and
interestingly
enough,
that
is
what
the
trial
examiners
introduced
the
statement
said.
if
so,
your
honors,
my
task
would
be
an
easy
one
because
under
the
test
i
have
just
shown,
this
court
would
be
the
expert
agency
to
apply
the
various
factors
of
traditional
independent
agency.
but
i
fear
that
if
we
argued
the
case
on
the
basis
of
their
being
no
significant
dispute,
your
honors,
when
you
reread
the
briefs,
would
find
that
it
would
be
like
hans
christian
andersen's
famous
“the
emperor's
new
clothes”.
you
would
find
that
it
was
all
a
mirage
because
the
simple
fact
is
that
they're
very
substantial
disputes.
i
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
my
friend,
mr.
groner,
and
i'm
sure
it
was
an
inadvertence,
say
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
one
of
the
differences
between
this
case
and
the
other
cases
was
that
this
case
the
board
offered
more
witnesses.
the
board
had
one
significant
witness
in
this
case.
you
couldn't
have
less
than
that
and
it
had
one
witness
to
corroborate
on
transfers,
very
brief
witness
who
told
very
briefly.
and
that
was
the
total
board's
case.
there
wasn't
one
other
solitary
thing
type
of
testimony
in
the
board.
so,
mr.
groner's
recollection
obviously
is
at
fault.
now,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
a
minute
about
what
debit
agents
do?
if
they
are
such
simple
focus,
mr.
manoli
described
to
your
honors,
if
their
total
time
is
simply
devoted
to
knocking
at
the
door
in
saying
“your
premium
is
due,
please
pay
it”,
why
does
the
brief
of
the
government
spend
more
than
50%
on
the
facts?
and
why
does
the
union
brief
takes
44
pages
to
do
nothing
but
state
the
facts?
it's
because
it
is
not
an
uncomplicated
job.
mr.
manoli's
deprecatory
references
to
the
debit
agents
activities
calls
for
a
very
brief
statement
of
what
they
are.
i
take
it
that
every
one
would
agree
that
united
had
the
right
to
parcel
out
this
phase
of
its
business.
business
can
parcel
out
anything
that
it
wants
to.
it
could
have
parceled
out
its
advertising;
it
could
parcel
out
its
accounting.
it
shows
to
parcel
out
three
phases
of
its
business.
one
is
the
collecting,
it
is
true,
another
is
the
selling,
and
the
third
is
the
servicing
of
its
policies.
i'd
like
to
tell
your
honors,
that
a
third
of
the
income
of
these
people
comes
from
not
from
collections,
but
from
the
new
business
they
write.
and
i
might
say
as
this
record
shows
one-third
to
40%
of
their
time
spent
on
activities
other
than
collecting,
selling,
servicing
of
policies.
but
don't
let
me
deprecate
selling,
your
honors,
it's
not
a
routine
job
to
collect
premiums
on
insurance
policies.
each
collection
in
the
first
place
is
the
reselling
job.
these
are
simple
folk
that
buy
industrial
insurance.
they
have
to
be
resold
each
time
you
collect
the
policy.
i
may
say
competition
is
very
keen.
it's
a
good
deal
of
endeavor
to
try
to
change
these
people
especially
early
in
the
policy
where
there's
no
loss
to
other
policies.
the
scheduling
in
a
wide
territory
is
difficult.
he
must
learn
the
habits
of
each
client.
he
must
learn
the
best
time
to
collect.
he
must
learn
about
the
man
who
when
he
gets
his
pay
on
friday,
no
longer
has
it
on
sunday
night.
he's
going
to
get
there
friday
before
it
goes
to
the
corner
cup
brew.
he's
got
to
know
about
the
housewife
who
will
spend
her
allowance
monday.
prepayment
is
a
very,
very
important
thing.
he's
got
to
know
that
the
man
who
works,
for
example,
on
a
contracting
job
in
montana
may
have
months
without
work
and
he's
got
to
try
to
persuade
that
man
to
pay
in
advance
three
or
four
months
premiums
so
the
policy
won't
lapse
during
the
time
that
the
snows
are
on
the
ground
and
no
construction
is
going
on.
so
that,
your
honors,
i
suggest
that
there's
nothing
routine
or
clerical
about
this
kind
of
collection.
he's
got
to
be
a
specialist;
he's
got
to
learn
how
to
be.
selling
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
without
doubt.
but
they
could
have
paid
the
salary,
they
could
have
paid
an
employee
but
this
company
has
decided
that
its
best
interests
are
not
using
an
employee.
i
would
say
your
honors
that
90%
of
the
independent
contractorship
can
be
done
through
employees.
i'm
one
of
the
board
of
the
distributors
for
rca.
we,
in
philadelphia,
distributes
through
an
independent
agency.
in
your
state,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
california,
rca
distributes
itself.
it
doesn't
use
a
distributor.
in
chicago,
it
doesn't
use
a
distributor.
it
does
it
through
its
own
employees.
the
choice
is
the
contractor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
was
stressing
that,
your
honor,
to
show
why
this
company
believes
that
it's
wise
to
give
it
to
the
individual
entrepreneur.
now,
some
other
companies
believe
differently
like
phoenix.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
get
a
good
deal
more
out
of
it
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
get
out
of
it
the
fact,
and
i
might
say
i
read
more
of
the
reports
this
morning
than
we
quoted
because
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
specific
inquiries,
which
we
didn't
have
before
when
we
wrote
the
brief,
but
i
get
of
it
this.
i
get
out
of
it
that
what
the
board
was
saying
is
that
there
is
nothing
technical
about
this
relationship.
there
is
nothing
in
which
there's
an
expertness
on
the
part
of
the
board;
that
this
is
an
area
wants
the
court
to
be
the
expert
in
applying
the
principles
in
weighing
the
factors;
that
the
traditional
law
of
respondeat
superior,
that
the
law
of
agency
which
created
the
difference
between
independent
contractor
and
employee
which
the
courts
created
shall
apply
here
and
the
court
shall
not
have
what
it
called
false
reliance
upon
the
board.
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
report,
your
honor,
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
it
verbatim.
and,
i
get
the
fact
that
senator
taft
said
it
is
not
as
my
friend
mr.
manoli
said,
a
matter
for
the
board's
expert
fact
determination
among
factors
but
it's
one
of
law.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and
the
committee
reports
and
senator
taft
say
that
here's
where
this
court
--
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
texas
transmission
case,
this
court
said
that
when
contract
principles
were
involved,
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
expertise,
it's
this
court
that
overruled
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
interpretation
of
whether
“they
had
entered
into”
or
rather
whether
“texas
gas
transmission
had
entered
into
a
new
contract,
a
contract”.
and
so
in
the
chenery
case,
this
court
said
that
it
was
the
courts
that
were
expert
on
the
law
of
fiduciary
obligations.
and
so
when
the
sec
said
there
was
a
violation
of
fiduciary
obligations,
this
court
said
it
owed
no
filthy
to
that
finding.
and,
what
congress
said,
is
the
court
who
has
mistaken
with
full
deference.
the
court
was
mistaken
in
saying
that
it
did
owe
that
type
of
application
in
the
determination
of
this
question
in
the
hearst
case.
surely,
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
precisely
what
senator
taft
said.
he
said,
“there
are
no
talismanic
words
to
define
the
relationship
but
it's
the
courts
that
are
experts
and
not
the
nlrb.
the
fact,
the
very
factors
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'm
quoting
them,
your
honor.
he
said
there
are
no
talismanic
words.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
he
said
that
it
is
for
the
court
to
make
the
determination
of
his
whole
complaint
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
the
scope
of
review.
his
whole
complaint,
his
second
complaint
was
as
first
complaint,
was
really
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
questions.
not
to
be
anticipated
them
but
he
did
answer
them.
his
second
complaint
was
that
the
court
was
wrong
as
to
the
scope
of
review
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
your
honor,
i
sat
for
three
months
and
the
counsel
for
the
american
wants
it
to
in
arguing
this
but
we,
i'm
sure
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
right
of
control
is
the
primary
test.
now,
the
rest
of
it
are
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say
it's
primary
and
i'd
say
it's
80%.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
that's
right.
i'd
say
that
right
of
control
is
a
primary
and
not
the
sole
test,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
there
are.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
reinstatement,
we
took
a
specific
example.
we
said
take
the
salesmen
an
illustration.
we
said
take
the
salesman,
who
supplies
his
own
car
as
this
man
does
and
who
goes
out
on
his
own
to
sell
as
this
man
does.
they
said
in
that
case
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
he's
an
employee.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
in
the
reinstatement,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
for
all
states.
i
have
to
say
that
are
differs
in
states.
some
states
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
in
most
states,
they
would
say
that.
that's
an
obligation
imposed
on
law
and
explains
why
in
a
book
to
which
i
will
refer
the
rate
book
which
mr.
manoli
thought
consisted
of
instructions
and
has
only
two
pages
of
suggestion
as
to
policy
that
is
emphasized
not
to
make
any
misrepresentation
and
that
the
reason
given
is,
that
the
company
in
maryland
as
that
happens
where
this
was
involved
is
responsible.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
are
some
states
that
have
solved
that
responsibility,
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
it
takes
safeguard.
that's
all
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say
that
is
right
but
i'd
like
to
add
to
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
except
as
the
law
adds
one
requirement
that
is
no
different
from
the
handling
of
general
motors
product
by
its
distributor
or
the
handling
of
rca
product
by
its
distributor.
what
the
law
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
what
the
board
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
was
about
to
say
and
that's
what
i
want
to
add.
what
the
law
imposes
here
is
that
the
company
is
allowed
to
sell
only
the
contract
that
is
approved
by
the
insurance
commissioner
and
that
the
rates
improved
by
the
insurance
commissioner.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honor,
i'd
rather
restrict
it
to
representations
rather
than
actions.
but,
i
may
say
that
that
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
insurance
broker
who
himself
employs
a
hundred
men,
he
is
bound
by
the
policy,
he
is
bound
by
the
rate
and
his
misrepresentation
binds
the
company
and
yet
not
even
the
board
would
hold.
we
tendered
the
testimony
here
although
it
was
rejected
of
an
independent
insurance
broker
who
himself
employs
a
large
number
of
men
and
this
is
a
very
large
offer
of
proof,
both
in
this
case
and
the
prior
case,
to
demonstrate
that
such
controls
as
there
are
here
are
precisely
the
same
as
to
him.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
agree
to
that
very
readily,
mr.
justice
fortas.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
agents
pay
their
own
accident
liability.
they
pay
their
own
burglary
insurance
in
case
the
funds
which
they
have
collected
are
stolen.
they
own
the
cars.
they
pay
the
expense
of
the
cars.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
not
at
all,
not
in
anyway.
now,
those
with
very
wide
territories,
because
of
time
and
many
elements
in
a
very
few
in
number,
get
1%
commission
on
collections
additional
but
a
great
bulk
of
agents
don't
get
that
and
they
are
never
reimbursed
in
any
way
for
the
items
that
you
have
mentioned,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
won't
emphasize
the
expertise
that
goes
into
selling
except
that
i'd
just
like
to
say
this,
your
honors,
that
these
debit
agents
sell
from
one-third
to
40%
of
all
the
ordinary,
the
non-debit
insurance
type,
the
non-industrial
life
sold
by
this
company.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
manoli
whether
debit
agents
hold
other
jobs.
mr.
manoli
answered
having
no
advance
notice,
of
course,
of
the
question
that
usually,
that
some
of
them
can
sell
other
insurance
but
usually
do
not.
well,
as
to
that
answer,
he
was
mistaken.
this
record
shows
that
the
board's
witness,
mr.
scott,
had
four
licenses
to
sell
for
other
companies;
that
he
sold
in
five
months
one
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
of
insurance
for
other
companies.
it
shows
that
mr.
spalding,
who
devotes
just
20
hours
a
week
to
his
work
for
united,
devotes
the
rest
of
his
time
to
selling
casualty
or
on
appeal
insurance
for
other
companies.
the
prior
record
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
gives
29
men
who
hold
licenses
and
sell
insurance
for
other
companies.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
then
followed
that
up
with
a
question,
“do
they
engage
in
other
businesses?”
and
mr.
manoli
replied,
“no”.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
with
deference
he
has
mistaken.
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
have
the
right
to
engage
in
other
businesses,
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
do.
as
this
record
show
one
witness
testified
he
is
in
the
real
estate
business.
another
runs
a
ballet
school
with
his
wife
and
as
an
actor
and
playwright.
i
may
say
that
he's
on
the
board
of
the
john
hopkins'
great
facility
in
that
field
board
of
trustees.
another
sells
general
merchandize
on
credit
and
another
sells
used
cars
and
obviously,
there
are
many
other
activities.
these
are
just
typical.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
you
mean
--
their
headquarters,
your
honor,
is
admittedly
in
this
record,
their
homes
or
portions
of
their
homes
set
apart
and
they
deduct
from
their
income
tax
for
that
use
of
their
home;
everyone
of
them.
the
prior
record
shows
that
some
of
them
rent
their
own
offices
and
pay
their
rent
and
their
telephone.
now,
the
board
conceded
that
these
men
do
not
come
to
the
district
offices
more
than
once
a
week
and
that
when
there,
they
are
not
there
more
than
two
to
four
hours
in
a
whole
week.
so,
it's
obvious,
that's
not
the
center
of
their
activity.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
come
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
first
to
present
a
weekly
report.
and
while
i'm
on
it,
i
may
as
well
get
back
straighten,
it's
not
that
complicated
difficult
accounting
report
of
great
detail
which
my
friend
has
referred
to
and
which
was
present
in
the
phoenix
case
where
everyday
they
have
to
report
the
hours,
the
people
they
saw,
their
sales,
what
they
did
hour
by
hour.
that's
one
of
the
differences
that
in
the
phoenix
case
they
were
employees
and
they
had
a
work
at
certain
number
of
hours
and
they
had
to
respect
their
hours.
whereas
here,
admittedly,
they
are
on
their
own
and
the
--
it
is
made
very
clearer
indeed
that
these
agents
have
no
restrictions
at
all.
that
the
report
that
comes
in
weekly
that
chief
justice
asked
about
is
a
report
of
the
new
business
they
sold.
obviously,
they
got
to
report
back
was
then
policies
are
assured
on
them
within
the
next
couple
of
weeks
and
every
other
phase,
it's
in
the
record
and
it's
a
one-page
report,
and
it's
their
own
computation
of
their
own
commissions
because
this
money
though
trust
funds
in
the
hands
of
an
insurance
agent,
a
general
insurance
agent,
are
not
trust
funds
in
their
hands.
they
may
use
them
for
whatever
their
purpose.
once
a
week
when
they
come
in,
they
turnover
the
net,
they
take
out
their
commission.
if
they've
settled
any
claims,
they
take
out
their
claims.
if
they
have
any
checks
they've
collected,
they
turn
in
the
checks
and
the
net
is
what
the
company
gets.
then
there
are
meetings
on
that
day
of
the
week
at
which
changes
in
the
law,
recommendations
as
to
policy
are
given
to
these
people.
they
are
very
much
the
same
as
the
general
sales
meetings
that
all
big
companies
in
america
have
for
their
distributors
except
that,
frankly,
they
occur
much
more
often.
i
mentioned
the
distributor
in
philadelphia;
rca
has
a
man
exclusively
assigned
to
that
distributor
100%
of
the
time.
that
isn't
because
they
want
to
control,
that's
what
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
their
products
are
marketed
in
the
best
possible
way.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
it
were,
you
simply
couldn't
get
enough
of
them
with
the
turnover.
but
i
would
say
that
the
success
of
the
agent
--
you
see
their
compensation
runs
from
$7,000
and
pull
or
more
to
$20,000
a
year
in
this
record.
the
success
of
the
agent
depends
on
how
quickly
he
becomes
a
specialist.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
sorry,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
show.
all
that
shows
is
that
some
were
old-time
insurance
agents
and
some
had
no
experience
at
all.
one
testified
he'd
been
in
it
for
20
or
30
years
and
actually
had
been
a
general
agent.
another
testified
he
hadn't
been
in
it
at
all.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
mr.
manoli
said
yesterday
that
there
are
3,000.
that's
not
in
the
record
but
i
would
guess
it's
about
right.
perhaps
a
low
by
two
or
three
hundred
and
involved
here
are
a
159
and
i
want
to
get
to
a
difference
because
there
were
80
in
st.
paul
street
and
79
in
franklin
street.
and
that's
really
the
difference
to
answer
mr.
justice
fortas
between
the
other
case
and
this.
now,
i
pat
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor,
that
in
maryland,
it's
$7,000
to
$20,000
a
year.
that's
very
specific.
now,
i
might
say
as
to
servicing
policies
that's
an
expert
job.
they
have
to
help
with
the
claim
forms,
they
settle
claims,
change
the
beneficiary,
cash
surrender
value,
loans,
advances,
terms
of
--
there
are
many
policies
involved,
insurable
interest,
illegibility
of
beneficiary
clause.
these
are
things
--
then
got
to
pass
an
examination
given
by
the
insurance
commissioner
before
they
can
get
their
license.
now,
i
must
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say,
your
honor,
that
the
categorical
answer
that
we
make
is
no
and
the
prior
examiners
so
found,
if
i'm
going
to
come
to
these
examiner,
admittedly
there's
no
individualized
treatment.
they
are
only
there
two
to
four
hours
and
perform
all
these
things.
there
is
a
general
meeting
at
which
company,
the
assistant
manager,
will
go
over
with
them,
developments
in
the
field.
but
that
is
advisory
and
as
i
say
it
has
its
direct
counterpart
in
the
kind
of
meetings
held
for
distributors
by
large
industries
throughout
america.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
they
will
go
over
everything
from
saying,
“you
better
be
advised
that
the
weather
report
show,
whitely
snow
next
week”;
they
will
tell
them
that
the
insurance
commissioner
has
issued
the
ruling;
they
will
say
that
the
experience
in
philadelphia
or
chicago
has
demonstrated
x
or
y
which
you
men
may
want
to
take
into
consideration.
they
are
the
kind
of
promotional
inspirational
meetings
that
you
expect
the
projector
of
a
project
to
try
to
inspire
his
independent
contractors
or
his
employees
with.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they're
used
in
both.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
say
it
or
his
employee's
salesmen.
i
say
in
either
event
that's
the
kind
of
meeting
they
have.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
certainly,
your
honor,
there's
a
great
mistake
in
this
record.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
now
there
is
evidence
on
this
record
to
this
extent.
one,
that
they
have
the
right
to;
two,
that
they
use
other
members
of
their
family.
one
man,
for
example
testified
that
his
wife
does
collect
before
hand.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
none.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
without
doubt.
now,
there's
one
who
for
example
said
that
he
hires
the
payroll
girl
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
his
original
--
when
he
comes
with
the
company,
he
has
what
is
called
the
“debit”
and
that's
a
list
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
anywhere
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
indeed
one
man
testified,
he
pursued
his
customers
outside
the
maryland
and
one
went
to
columbia
in
south
america
where
he
has
--
he
sold
the
policy.
and,
well
i
think
that
answers
your
honest
question.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
wouldn't
be
given
a
contract
here.
he
just
wouldn't
be
with
the
company.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
with
this
company?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
this
company,
of
course,
as
does
any
good
company
investigates
the
background.
these
people
going
to
home
should
get
to
be
very
careful.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
typical,
independent
contractorship.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
i
think
every
company
has
to
select
whether
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
whether
they
are
independent
contractors,
mr.
justice
black
or
employees.
the
company
is
very
foolish
that
doesn't
set
a
high
standard.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
didn't
finish
that.
the
law
is
that
you
may
not
employ
as
a
salesman
anyone
other
than
another
licensed
salesman
for
that
company.
if
i'm
licensed
to
sell
for
equitable,
i
can't
sell
for
united.
i
must
have
two
licenses.
but
as
to
the
collection,
as
to
the
servicing,
as
to
the
other
activities,
they
are
free
to
take
on
their
pick,
anyone
they
want.
now,
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
they
took
one
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
can
take
on
whom
they
want.
i
would
presume
that
if
they
took
on
a
thief,
the
company
would
have
to
say,
“if
you
want
to
employ
thieves,
your
contract
is
terminated.”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
just
as
they
would
do
with
the
distributor
of
rca.
if
he
has
thieves
going
around
the
salesman,
they
simply
will
separate
with
their
contract.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
not
all.
excuse
me?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it's
an
old
question
of
the
floor
and
the
ceiling,
mr.
justice
black.
it
doesn't
have
control.
but
when
it
gets
out
of
control,
it
can
sever
the
relationship.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
out
of
control
of
the
contractor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
are,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
either
party.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
either
party
just
as
in
the
news
case.
i
have
a
case
right
now
for
a
distributor
with
a
$7
million
investment
where
he
was
told
on
monday
morning
he
was
out.
we're
taking
the
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
put
them
out
but
they
got
to
do
something
about
the
stock
that
he
has
on
hand.
this
is
not
peculiar
to
the
insurance
business.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and
it's
getting
more
and
more
common,
your
honor,
to
the
independent
contractor
relationship
as
big
companies
do
to
improve
transportation
and
communication
are
not
as
dependent
they
were.
this
is
why
where
rca
and
thought
of
you
can
get
an
outstanding
distributor
that
will
to
$50
million,
$60
million
a
year
business
and
have
a
building,
a
block
long
it
uses
them.
and
when
in
chicago,
it
had
to
terminate
and
then
feel
it
could
get
to
someone
else;
it
went
into
its
own
distributorship
and
formed
the
rca
distributing
company.
this
is
not
peculiar
again
to
this
business.
now,
some
have
a
month
termination
notice
but
i
don't
know
of
any
independent
contract
with
my
experience
as
a
lawyer
that
had
more
than
three
months
notice.
and
there,
there
are
people
with
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
of
investment.
now,
i
would
say
the
basic
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
is
that
the
board
takes
the
position,
that
a
debit
agent
is
generically
an
employee
and
the
court
takes
the
position
that
that
is
not
so.
the
board
pursues
with
that
at
determination
and
the
court
would
find
discrimination.
and
so,
the
board
says
in
the
phoenix
case
that
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
taking
the
word
“fine”
as
in
this
day
defining
discrimination
and
eliminating
any
onerous
aspects
of
that
may
have
a
connotation
that
it's
much
better
to
take
it
case
by
case
and
not
have
a
rule
that
applies
regardless,
a
rule
which
is
based
on
the
economic
realities.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
mr.
manoli
replied
that
united
is
the
only
holdout,
the
only
company
that
still
employs
debit
agents
as
employees.
it
just
happens.
i
know
that
it's
wrong
because
our
office
had
litigation
last
year
in
which
the
president
of
the
company
called
pilgrim
life
insurance
company
testified
that
his
debit
agents
are
independent
contractors.
i
happen
to
know
in
my
own
city
that
there
is
a
company
who
put
up
the
united
life
insurance
company
where
they
operate
as
independent
contractors
and
i've
been
informed
by
the
president
of
this
company
last
evening,
the
american
general
life
insurance
company
of
houston.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
alright.
yes.
no,
i
think
it's
the
union
is
making
my
notes.
well
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
two
things
that
curiously
were
not
mentioned
here.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
whether
the
records
weren't
really
the
same
and
i'd
like
to
say,
your
honors,
they
are
different
in
one
respect.
it
is
true
that
in
the
other
cases
the
examiners
made
that
pertinent
findings
and
they
found
the
facts
as
they
were
and
they
concluded
on
this
board's
philosophy
of
economic
realities
that
these
are
debit
agents.
but
they
said
they
are
on
their
own
and
they
have
unlimited
hours,
they
can
do
what
they
please,
they
can
work
20
hours
as
one
man
testified
or
42
hours
as
another
man
testified.
this
examiner
found
every
significant
fact
against
the
company.
and
not
only
that,
the
conceded
facts,
this
fact
that
i
mentioned,
he
just
diluted
it,
he
reduced
it,
he
said
it
applied
only
to
selling.
he
then
said
that
it
was
too
in
extent
and
he
then
said
they
have
to
work
day
and
night
anyway,
that
it's
all
around
the
clock
job
which
of
course,
it
isn't.
the
testimony
here
is
at
20
hours
to
42.
but
there
is
--
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
for
the
company
here
was
virtually
identical.
it
happens
the
same
lawyer
tried
the
cases,
it
happened
to
be
my
brother.
it
happens
that
the
same
attorney
from
the
company
was
assigned
to
the
case.
they
operate
uniformly.
there
is
a
big
difference
and
this
difference
is
franklin
street.
this
company
had
taken
over
quaker
and
incidentally,
it's
interesting
that
my
friends
do
not
even
refer
to.
the
company
took
over
the
quaker
city
life
insurance
company,
which
was
a
company
whose
debit
agents
were
clearly
employees.
they
exercise
all
controls,
they
required
the
reports
that
were
present
in
phoenix
life
and
that
we‘ve
outlined.
a
man
named
scott,
by
the
examiner's
definition,
became
the
ring
leader.
the
examiner
said
that
mr.
scott
was
obviously
partisan,
was
obviously
endeavoring
to
further
the
general
counsel's
case.
but
he
believed
scott
explicitly
and
every
single
word
he
said
and
most
of
his
words
were
different
from
both
board
witnesses
and
employee
and
employer
witnesses
or
company
witnesses
in
the
last
case.
now,
he
was
at
franklin
street
and
all
of
the
former
agents
of
the
quaker
city
life
were
at
franklin
street.
and
curiously,
this
one
witness
that
the
board
produced
and
the
witness
who
substantiated
him
as
to
these
transfers
both
came
from
franklin
street.
admittedly,
they
knew
nothing
about
st.paul
street.
we
put
on
the
assistant
manager
we
had
at
franklin
street.
obviously,
these
fellows
were
formed
as
a
group.
they
were
filing
written
demands.
they
were
endeavoring
to
frustrate
the
endeavor
to
make
them
independent
contractors.
now,
here
were
our
witnesses,
all
of
them
were
from
st.
paul
street,
which
had
been
our
traditional
office
there.
both
are
covered
here.
there
were
80
agents
there
in
79.
and
this
examined,
without
a
word
of
testimony
by
a
board
witness
what
went
on
to
st.
paul
street
simply
said
everything
scott
said
applied
to
st.
paul
street.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
no
court
could
sustain
that
and
this
court
didn't
sustain
that.
now,
the
examiner
tried
to
get
around
that
by
saying,
“no,
but
that
only
went
on
for
two
weeks
in
march
and
it
was
all
over
by
then.”
but
this
record
has
letters
in
june
and
in
september
and
it
has
the
testimony
of
mr.
forwaldt,
the
assistant
manager
who
said
things
were
chaotic
in
december
at
that
time
of
the
hearing.this
was
an
aberration.
this
was
sui
generis
at
this
one
point.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
the
examiner,
in
trying
to
gloss
it
over
as
a
part
of
a
kind
of
absolute
policy
that
he
was
going
to
write
the
one
--
he
was
going
to
write
the
one
report
decision
that
couldn't
be
reversed
by
a
court,
differed
from
all
of
his
predecessors
in
the
findings.
there's
been
one
sense
and
we
cite
the
case
in
the
footnote.
i'm
going
to
send
the
clerk
the
citation
because
it
will
show,
your
honors,
how
the
same
agents
have
been
treated
as
if
they
were
different
breeds
of
animals
in
the
four
other
trial
examiners
versus
this
one.
now,
this
examiner
did
a
remarkable
thing.
the
court
said
that
it
seriously
influenced
the
court
and
yet,
your
honors,
mr.
manoli
didn't
refer
to
it
this
morning.
mr.
groner
didn't
refer
to
it
this
morning.
the
board
brief
relegates
it
to
the
very
last
footnote
on
the
very
last
page
and
the
union
does
the
same
thing.
and
this
was
something
which
the
court
below
simply
could
not
accept.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
your
honor,
it's
a
very
major
part
of
its
decision.
the
court
below
said
that
there
was
not,
from
its
examination
of
the
records,
substantial
evidence
for
critical
facts
and
there
were
at
best
what
it
called
tenuous
support
for
others.
it
said
that
critical
findings
had
infirmities
from
the
standpoint
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence
we
support
and
it
gave
the
test
of
universal
camera
and
said
it
could
not
conscientiously
rely
on
this
examiner.
now,
then
it
gave
this
story,
it
said,
“why
is
it
that
this
examiner
believed
one
witness,
who
admittedly
know
only
about
franklin
street
and
disbelieved
all
the
others
who
testified
about
a
wholly
different
location?”
and
he
said
“that
he
was
undoubtedly
influenced
by
the
fact
that
he
said
as
he
observed
these
not
witnesses
but
debit
agents,
both
those
who
testified
and
those
who
didn't
in
the
courtroom,
he
called
it
on
and
off
the
stand
demeanor”.
as
he
observed
their
demeanor,
they
showed
--
i'd
like
to
read
that
to
your
honors.
“they
showed
a
servile
attitude.”
they
showed
something
--
let
just
if
i
may
read
that
to
your
honor.
i
have
that
right
here.
here
it
is.
“they
showed
a
marked
deference
beyond
the
sometimes
illusive
requirements
of
courtesy.”
he
said
that
“they
failed
to
show
in
their
off
the
stand
and
on
the
stand
attitude,
a
demeanor
of
independence.”
and
he
said,
“typical
of
what
happened,
his
attitude
was
when
there
was
stipulated
that
six
witnesses,
six
debit
agents
wouldn't
testify,
they
just
identified
themselves
and
the
testimony
would
be
the
same
as
the
other”.
he
said,
“while
being
deprived
of
their
‘moments
of
the
glory'”.
and
this
was
his
all
attitude
towards
these
debit
agents.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
“moments
of
glory”
is
877
if
it
please
your
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
and
the
--
but
the
important
matter,
your
honor,
that
demeanor
testimony,
you
will
find
it
on
page
1151,
i
mean
the
demeanor
statement,
1151
in
footnote
26,
which
starts
on
that
page;
it's
a
very
long
footnote.
then
he
says,
he
makes
the
significant
finding.
he
terms
it
a
“finding”
that
i
just
read
to
your
honors.
and
then
in
the
text,
he
says,
that
“he
uses
this
in
conjunction
with
other
and
themselves
sufficient
basis
for
all
of
these
findings”.
now
what
is
the
board
do
with
that?
the
board
puts
that
in
a
footnote
too.
and
the
board
says,
--
the
board
says,
“we
do
not,”
one
sentence,
“we
do
not
rely
on
the
trial
examiner's
observation
as
set
out
in
the
footnote,”
observation.
now,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
by
saying
they
don't
agree
with
the
observation
in
the
footnote,
i
don't
know
whether
they
mean
they
don't
agree
with
the
“finding”,
so
label
the
finding
by
the
examiner.
but
it
isn't
just
the
footnote.
the
text
says
that,
“as
he
observed
the
debit
agents
in
eight
days
of
hearings,”
well,
our
people
run
stand
only
five
days,
so
his
textual
reference
has
to
be
off
the
stand
as
well
and
he
says
that,
his
observation,
he
is
using
that
support
for
“my
findings”.
and
i
submit,
that
the
court
then
said,
“we
can't
do
that.”
the
whole
thing
is
tainted.
this
whole
attitude,
the
reason
he
had
said
these
people
are
unworthy
of
belief
is
because
they
are
saying
things
which
label
them
as
independent
contractors
and
his
view
is,
that
they're
servile,
that
they
don't
show
ordinary
independence
as
they
walk
around
the
courtroom.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
your
honor.
he
didn't
swear
himself
and
he
rode
a
very
learned
discourse
on
why
off
the
stand,
demeanor
was
proper.
and
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
that's
a
short
form
of
order.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
rather
defer
to
mr.
manoli.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
usually
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
yes,
and
the
court
very,
very
conscientiously
went
into
why.
the
court
pointed
out
that
you
cannot
split
up
a
man's
mind
in
two
segments.
and
say,
well,
we
know
he
wasn't
influenced
although
we
said
he
was.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
court
under
these
circumstances,
since
my
time
is
almost
up,
this
court
under
these
circumstances
applied
the
rule
of
the
universal
camera
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
your
honor,
all
the
evidence
they
gave
in
the
other
cases.
they
gave
evidences
to
the
fact
that
there
are
hours
of
work
are
free.
there
are
1,500
pages,
i
guess
of
evidence.
12,000
pages
of
evidence.
they
went
through
the
fact.
they
own
their
own
automobiles.
they
thought
what
the
answers
that
i
gave
to
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
why
sure
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
said
--
he
specifically
found
that
the
1%
that
a
few
agents
get
is
for
transportation
and
he
disregarded
the
rest.
he
never
mentions
that
in
his
opinion,
your
honor,
if
it's
not
important.
the
reinstatement
says
that
that
is
a
factor,
that's
important.
he
disregards
it.
he
never
even
mentions
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
didn't
say
that
but
he
said
that
they're
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
the
evidence
is
vigorously
in
dispute.
and
that's
what
i
stored
out
by.
that's
where
i
disagree
with
my
friends.
that's
why
they
take
so
much
time
to
go
through
the
facts
and
that's
why
we
do
so.
and,
if
may,
your
honors,
simply
say
that
in
the
scope
of
review,
this
court
faithfully
and
loyally
followed
universal
camera.
the
court
made
it
very
clear
and
i
might
i
say
that
here,
the
brief
is
perfectly
clear
of
the
board
that
it
wants
to
return
to
warrant
in
law
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
law.
well,
this
court
said
on
that
point
unanimously
in
universal
camera
and
in
pittsburg
steamship
that
that
is
no
longer
the
test.
and
i
submit
that
the
court,
having
followed
the
standard,
having
reviewed
the
finding,
having
found
it
couldn't
conscientiously
rely
was
in
this
posture.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
for
this
court,
“where
we
called
upon
to
pass
on
the
boards
conclusions
in
the
first
instance,
or
to
make
an
independent
review,
of
the
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
might
well
support
the
boards
conclusion
and
reject
that
of
the
court
below.
but
congress
has
charged
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
this
court,
with
normal
and
primary
responsibility
for
granting
or
denying
enforcement
orders.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
having
applied
the
test
under
the
mandate
of
the
act,
having
followed
faithfully
the
universal
camera's
scope
of
review,
the
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
right
here
and
now,
i
should
like
to
sever
the
connection
which
my
friends
this
morning
have
built
between
them
and
me.
they
have
said,
mr.
manoli,
yesterday
that
there
is
no
significant
dispute
as
to
facts.
mr.
manoli
said
there
was
no
significant
dispute
as
to
the
scope
of
review
or
as
to
the
definition.
and
this
morning,
i
hear
from
my
friend,
mr.
groner
that
there
is
no
significant
dispute
between
us,
as
to
the
meaning
of
congress,
as
to
what
happened
to
the
hearst
act,
as
to
whether
news
voice
are
or
are
not
covered.
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
in
the
words
of
the
famous
author,
“methinks
my
lady
doth
protest
too
loudly.”
the
fact
is,
that
of
course
there
are
very,
very
substantial
differences
between
us.
the
fact
is,
as
we
apprehend
the
law,
congress
intended
very
specific
and
very
positive
and
very
definite
results.
mr.
manoli
said
yesterday
that
in
his
view,
the
only
time
that
the
economic
realities
came
into
effect,
mind
with
you
the
hearst
case,
was
when
there
was
a
taft
case
that
in
the
easy
case
you
apply
the
law
of
agency.
and
in
the
taft
case,
and
i
quoted
exactly,
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute,
“tilt
the
scales”.
i
suggest,
your
honors,
if
that
is
true,
congress
achieve
nothing.
mr.
groner,
this
morning,
said
categorically,
mr.
manoli
said
this
morning
categorically
that
this
determination
is
not
one
of
law.
if
that
is
true,
your
honors,
then
senator
taft
was
completely
in
error
when
he
defined
for
the
congress
what
the
conference
report
achieved.
my
friends
say
that
they
have
not
departed
from
the
test.
let
me
read,
in
addition
to
the
portion
of
the
brief
that
mr.
justice
fortas
so
aptly
referred
to,
namely
the
footnote
and
other
part
of
the
brief
on
page
19.
the
determination
whether
an
individual
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor
thus
allows
considerable
room
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
and
discretion
tests
which
the
board,
with
its
wide
experience
in
handling
cases,
involving
different
hiring
relationships
is
a
specially
competent
to
perform.
then
we
skip
down
to
the
middle
of
the
page,
middle
of
the
sentence,
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
the
way
to
be
assigned
them
“are
so
infinite
and
subtle
that
of
necessity
a
large
major
of
informed
discretion”.
“so
infinite
and
subtle”
instead
of
so
simple
as
we
were
told
this
morning
that
of
necessity
at
large
and
measurable
of
informed
discretion
is
involved
in
the
exercise
by
the
board
of
its
primary
function
to
determine
whether
an
individual
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee.
and
then
comes
something,
which
i
don't
want
to
take
time
with
the
moment
for,
but
the
board
then
says
that
the
test
--
that
the
court
must
apply
is
warrant
in
the
record
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
law.
that
again
was
hearst
and
that
was
overruled
by
universal
camera
but
i'll
come
to
that
later.
and
then
i
come
to
the
footnote
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
and
i
see
where
the
board
feels
that
where
respondeat
superior,
which
is
what
congress
said
was
to
be
the
test,
the
same
test
that
has
been
applied
there.
that
where
that
is
not
involved,
the
subsequent
infusion
of
flexibility.
this
is
something
new
in
the
law
of
independent
contractor,
the
subsequent
infusion
of
flexibility
into
the
relevant
standard.
something
else
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
determining
employment
status
is
a
especially
appropriate
where
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is
not
to
decide
the
applicability
of
respondeat
superior
liability
but
to
determine
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
well,
that's
all
the
congress
was
dealt
with
if
it
–
dealing
with
if
it
please
the
court,
that's
the
coverage
of
the
national
relations
act.
now,
let
me
just
read
to
your
honors,
if
i
may,
and
i
have
not
intended
to
take
your
time
with
this,
two
excerpts,
one
from
the
house
committee
report
which
originated
the
language
and
the
other
from
senator
taft
in
explaining
to
the
senate
why
he
recommended
that
they
adopt
the
conference
report.
the
house
report
says,
“an
employee,
according
to
all
standard
dictionaries,
according
to
the
law
as
the
court
have
stated,
and
according
to
the
understanding
of
almost
everyone,
with
the
exception
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
means
“someone
who
works
for
another
for
hire.”
but
in
the
case
of
nlrb
against
hearst,
the
board
expanded
the
term
“employee”
beyond
anything
it
ever
had
included
before.
and
the
supreme
court,
relying
on
the
theoretic
expertness
of
the
board,
upheld
the
board.
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress,
when
it
passed
the
act,
authorized
the
board
to
give
to
every
word
in
the
act
whatever
meaning
it
wishes.
on
the
contrary,
congress
intended
then
and
it
intends
now
that
the
board
gives
to
words
not
farfetched
meanings
but
ordinary
measures,
ordinary
meanings.
to
correct
what
the
board
has
done
and
what
the
supreme
court
putting
misplaced
reliance
upon
the
board's
expertness
has
approved
the
bill
excludes
independent
contract
and
so
on.
and
what
does
mr.
senator
taft
do
to
my
friend's
argument
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
law?
“the
legal
effect
of
the
amendment
therefore”
he
says,
that
the
congress,
in
presenting
the
conference
report,
necessary
an
official
position,
“is
merely
to
make
it
clear
that
the
question
whether
or
not
a
person
is
an
employee
is
always
a
question
of
law,
always
a
question
of
law.”
since
the
term
is
not
meant
to
embrace
persons
outside
that
category
under
the
general
principles
of
the
law
of
agency.
excuse
me.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
you
have
a
question
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
an
act
which
involves
independent
contractors,
if
you
have
a
question
of
representation,
as
to
the
representation
question,
as
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
question,
do
regard
as
had
for
the
act.
but
when
you
get
to
the
independent
contractor,
then
as
we
say
the
controlling
principle
must
be
the
law
of
agency.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
precisely
what
we
meant
to
say,
your
honor,
that
nevertheless
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
we
say
never
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
nevertheless,
agency
principles
constitute
the
controlling
test.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
groner
was
saying,
your
honor,
that
this
is
never
a
question
of
law.
senator
taft
says
it
is
always
a
question
of
law.
mr.
groner
--
mr.
manoli
says
that
in
a
closed
case,
agency
principles
are
departed
from
and
you
look
only
at
the
purposes
of
the
act.
we
say
that
while
the
framework
is
the
act,
the
controlling
principle
must
be
agency
law.
certainly,
that's
what
we
intended
to
say,
that's
what
we
thought
we
said
that
we
didn't.
it
isn't
what
we
intended.
now,
i
address
myself
to
a
question,
several
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
and
that
is
what
the
senate
thought
as
to
the
specific
issue
of
this
case,
namely
the
newspaper
drivers.
i
may
say
that
in
the
back
of
our
brief
as
appendix
a,
we
have
drawn
three
columns,
four
columns
really.
the
first
are
the
items
that
were
considered
by
courts.
the
second
contains
the
items
which
the
courts
have
felt
important
as
to
united's
agents.
but,
of
course,
we
say
that
there
is
no
generic
debit
agent.
there
are
certain
things
they
have
in
common.
there
are
great
many
things
they
have
different
from
each
other.
the
third
contains
interestingly
enough.
the
items
in
the
phoenix
mutual
case
where
the
court
below
held
that
debit
agents
were
not
independent
contractors
but
were
employees
because
they
operated
differently
from
united's
employees
and
the
court
showed
the
difference
between
those.
and
the
last
column
shows
what's
in
the
hearst
case
the
court
defined
as
the
controls
and
lack
of
controls
over
the
news
voice.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
what
the
court
--
what
the
congress
said
about
the
hearst
and
then
specifically
about
these
rather
petty
types
of
employees
as
the
board
regarded
them.
in
the
first
place,
the
house
conference
report
said
it
is
believed
that
the
provisions
of
the
conference
agreement
relating
to
the
court's
reviewing
power
will
be
adequate
to
preclude
such
decisions
as
those
in
hearst.
now,
i
don't
know
what
precluding
a
decision
like
the
one
in
hearst
can
mean
except
precluding
the
holding
of
those
news
voice
to
be
employees.
and
then
i
go
to
a
portion
of
senator
taft's
statement
and
he
said
specifically,
“while
the
board
has
never
claimed
that
independent
contractors
were
employees,
the
supreme
court
has
the
hearst
publication's
case
held
that
the
ordinary
test
of
the
law
of
agency
could
be
disregarded
by
the
board
in
determining
if
petty
occupational
groups
were
employees.”
that's
very
much
like
mr.
manoli,
in
reverse.
mr.
manoli
says
that
where
it's
a
clear
case
and
that
he
very
clearly
says
as
these
petty
occupational
groups
in
effect,
the
board's
view
has
become
today
as
i
shall
show
that
you've
got
to
be
an
independent
businessman.
that
if
it's
the
type
of
thing
that
some
people
had
employees
and
some
have
independent
contractors
that
has
fled
from
the
law.
that's
not
what
the
congress
said.
the
congress
said
that,
if
petty
groups
were
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
labors
relations
act,
the
court
consequently
refused
to
consider
the
question.
the
legal
effect
of
the
amendment,
therefore,
is
to
make
clear
and
so
on.
so
that
i
would
say
categorically,
mr.
justice
white,
that
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
congress
in
an
issue
which
is
not
constitutional
in
character
but
merely
involves
what
it
wants
words
to
mean,
obviously,
it
could
use
any
word
and
define
as
it
pleases
and
this
court,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
bound
by
it.
the
congress
in
an
issue
not
involving
constitutional
questions
has
said,
the
court
has
played
mistaken,
has
paid
mistaken
difference
to
the
board.
this
is
a
question
where
the
court's
expertise,
where
the
long
list
of
cases
to
which
mr.
justice
black
referred,
whatever
may
have
been
the
issues
in
those
cases
have
established
the
law
of
independent
agency,
you
cannot
say
that
economic
realities
make
it
so
that
if
there's
a
right
of
termination,
if
the
status
is
not
a
lofty
status,
if
it's
not
an
independent
business,
will
no
longer
regard
it
as
an
independent
contractor.
and
i
can
see
the
reason
why
the
board
says
that.
the
board
says
that
because
its
function
is
to
extend
coverage,
to
extend
coverage.
congress
has
said,
it
extended
it
too
far.
now,
we
are
going
to
put
a
stop
in
this
one
respect.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor.
i
only
rely
on
two
things,
and
there
are
only
two
significant
ones.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
one
is
the
house
report
because
the
house
originated
the
language.
the
senate,
originally,
did
not.
then
in
the
conference,
senator
taft
and
the
senate
conferees
went
along
with
the
house
definition.
and
so,
the
second
thing
i
rely
on
is
the
conference
report,
house
and
senate,
and
senator
taft's
explanation
to
the
congress
of
what
the
conference
report
achieved
and
so
we
quote
the
house
report
and
we
quote
senator
taft
statement.
and
i
may
say
that
the
amicus
brief
quotes
further
portions
of
both.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
has
to
be,
your
honor.
if
you
will
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and,
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
this
tabulation
we've
shown,
you
will
find
fewer
controls
in
the
debit
agent
case
than
were
present
in
the
news
voice
case.
now,
i
address
myself
factually
to
a
statement
by
mr.
manoli.
he
says
there
is,
and
i
quote
him
exactly,
he
said
yesterday,
“there
is
really
no
significant
dispute
as
to
the
basic
facts.”
and
that
is
what
the
brief
says
for
the
government,
for
the
board
that
is
what
the
union
brief
says
and
interestingly
enough,
that
is
what
the
trial
examiners
introduced
the
statement
said.
if
so,
your
honors,
my
task
would
be
an
easy
one
because
under
the
test
i
have
just
shown,
this
court
would
be
the
expert
agency
to
apply
the
various
factors
of
traditional
independent
agency.
but
i
fear
that
if
we
argued
the
case
on
the
basis
of
their
being
no
significant
dispute,
your
honors,
when
you
reread
the
briefs,
would
find
that
it
would
be
like
hans
christian
andersen's
famous
“the
emperor's
new
clothes”.
you
would
find
that
it
was
all
a
mirage
because
the
simple
fact
is
that
they're
very
substantial
disputes.
i
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
my
friend,
mr.
groner,
and
i'm
sure
it
was
an
inadvertence,
say
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
one
of
the
differences
between
this
case
and
the
other
cases
was
that
this
case
the
board
offered
more
witnesses.
the
board
had
one
significant
witness
in
this
case.
you
couldn't
have
less
than
that
and
it
had
one
witness
to
corroborate
on
transfers,
very
brief
witness
who
told
very
briefly.
and
that
was
the
total
board's
case.
there
wasn't
one
other
solitary
thing
type
of
testimony
in
the
board.
so,
mr.
groner's
recollection
obviously
is
at
fault.
now,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
a
minute
about
what
debit
agents
do?
if
they
are
such
simple
focus,
mr.
manoli
described
to
your
honors,
if
their
total
time
is
simply
devoted
to
knocking
at
the
door
in
saying
“your
premium
is
due,
please
pay
it”,
why
does
the
brief
of
the
government
spend
more
than
50%
on
the
facts?
and
why
does
the
union
brief
takes
44
pages
to
do
nothing
but
state
the
facts?
it's
because
it
is
not
an
uncomplicated
job.
mr.
manoli's
deprecatory
references
to
the
debit
agents
activities
calls
for
a
very
brief
statement
of
what
they
are.
i
take
it
that
every
one
would
agree
that
united
had
the
right
to
parcel
out
this
phase
of
its
business.
business
can
parcel
out
anything
that
it
wants
to.
it
could
have
parceled
out
its
advertising;
it
could
parcel
out
its
accounting.
it
shows
to
parcel
out
three
phases
of
its
business.
one
is
the
collecting,
it
is
true,
another
is
the
selling,
and
the
third
is
the
servicing
of
its
policies.
i'd
like
to
tell
your
honors,
that
a
third
of
the
income
of
these
people
comes
from
not
from
collections,
but
from
the
new
business
they
write.
and
i
might
say
as
this
record
shows
one-third
to
40%
of
their
time
spent
on
activities
other
than
collecting,
selling,
servicing
of
policies.
but
don't
let
me
deprecate
selling,
your
honors,
it's
not
a
routine
job
to
collect
premiums
on
insurance
policies.
each
collection
in
the
first
place
is
the
reselling
job.
these
are
simple
folk
that
buy
industrial
insurance.
they
have
to
be
resold
each
time
you
collect
the
policy.
i
may
say
competition
is
very
keen.
it's
a
good
deal
of
endeavor
to
try
to
change
these
people
especially
early
in
the
policy
where
there's
no
loss
to
other
policies.
the
scheduling
in
a
wide
territory
is
difficult.
he
must
learn
the
habits
of
each
client.
he
must
learn
the
best
time
to
collect.
he
must
learn
about
the
man
who
when
he
gets
his
pay
on
friday,
no
longer
has
it
on
sunday
night.
he's
going
to
get
there
friday
before
it
goes
to
the
corner
cup
brew.
he's
got
to
know
about
the
housewife
who
will
spend
her
allowance
monday.
prepayment
is
a
very,
very
important
thing.
he's
got
to
know
that
the
man
who
works,
for
example,
on
a
contracting
job
in
montana
may
have
months
without
work
and
he's
got
to
try
to
persuade
that
man
to
pay
in
advance
three
or
four
months
premiums
so
the
policy
won't
lapse
during
the
time
that
the
snows
are
on
the
ground
and
no
construction
is
going
on.
so
that,
your
honors,
i
suggest
that
there's
nothing
routine
or
clerical
about
this
kind
of
collection.
he's
got
to
be
a
specialist;
he's
got
to
learn
how
to
be.
selling
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
without
doubt.
but
they
could
have
paid
the
salary,
they
could
have
paid
an
employee
but
this
company
has
decided
that
its
best
interests
are
not
using
an
employee.
i
would
say
your
honors
that
90%
of
the
independent
contractorship
can
be
done
through
employees.
i'm
one
of
the
board
of
the
distributors
for
rca.
we,
in
philadelphia,
distributes
through
an
independent
agency.
in
your
state,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
california,
rca
distributes
itself.
it
doesn't
use
a
distributor.
in
chicago,
it
doesn't
use
a
distributor.
it
does
it
through
its
own
employees.
the
choice
is
the
contractor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
was
stressing
that,
your
honor,
to
show
why
this
company
believes
that
it's
wise
to
give
it
to
the
individual
entrepreneur.
now,
some
other
companies
believe
differently
like
phoenix.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
get
a
good
deal
more
out
of
it
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
get
out
of
it
the
fact,
and
i
might
say
i
read
more
of
the
reports
this
morning
than
we
quoted
because
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
specific
inquiries,
which
we
didn't
have
before
when
we
wrote
the
brief,
but
i
get
of
it
this.
i
get
out
of
it
that
what
the
board
was
saying
is
that
there
is
nothing
technical
about
this
relationship.
there
is
nothing
in
which
there's
an
expertness
on
the
part
of
the
board;
that
this
is
an
area
wants
the
court
to
be
the
expert
in
applying
the
principles
in
weighing
the
factors;
that
the
traditional
law
of
respondeat
superior,
that
the
law
of
agency
which
created
the
difference
between
independent
contractor
and
employee
which
the
courts
created
shall
apply
here
and
the
court
shall
not
have
what
it
called
false
reliance
upon
the
board.
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
report,
your
honor,
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
it
verbatim.
and,
i
get
the
fact
that
senator
taft
said
it
is
not
as
my
friend
mr.
manoli
said,
a
matter
for
the
board's
expert
fact
determination
among
factors
but
it's
one
of
law.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and
the
committee
reports
and
senator
taft
say
that
here's
where
this
court
--
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
texas
transmission
case,
this
court
said
that
when
contract
principles
were
involved,
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
expertise,
it's
this
court
that
overruled
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
interpretation
of
whether
“they
had
entered
into”
or
rather
whether
“texas
gas
transmission
had
entered
into
a
new
contract,
a
contract”.
and
so
in
the
chenery
case,
this
court
said
that
it
was
the
courts
that
were
expert
on
the
law
of
fiduciary
obligations.
and
so
when
the
sec
said
there
was
a
violation
of
fiduciary
obligations,
this
court
said
it
owed
no
filthy
to
that
finding.
and,
what
congress
said,
is
the
court
who
has
mistaken
with
full
deference.
the
court
was
mistaken
in
saying
that
it
did
owe
that
type
of
application
in
the
determination
of
this
question
in
the
hearst
case.
surely,
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
precisely
what
senator
taft
said.
he
said,
“there
are
no
talismanic
words
to
define
the
relationship
but
it's
the
courts
that
are
experts
and
not
the
nlrb.
the
fact,
the
very
factors
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'm
quoting
them,
your
honor.
he
said
there
are
no
talismanic
words.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
he
said
that
it
is
for
the
court
to
make
the
determination
of
his
whole
complaint
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
the
scope
of
review.
his
whole
complaint,
his
second
complaint
was
as
first
complaint,
was
really
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
questions.
not
to
be
anticipated
them
but
he
did
answer
them.
his
second
complaint
was
that
the
court
was
wrong
as
to
the
scope
of
review
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
your
honor,
i
sat
for
three
months
and
the
counsel
for
the
american
wants
it
to
in
arguing
this
but
we,
i'm
sure
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
right
of
control
is
the
primary
test.
now,
the
rest
of
it
are
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say
it's
primary
and
i'd
say
it's
80%.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
that's
right.
i'd
say
that
right
of
control
is
a
primary
and
not
the
sole
test,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
there
are.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
reinstatement,
we
took
a
specific
example.
we
said
take
the
salesmen
an
illustration.
we
said
take
the
salesman,
who
supplies
his
own
car
as
this
man
does
and
who
goes
out
on
his
own
to
sell
as
this
man
does.
they
said
in
that
case
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
he's
an
employee.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
in
the
reinstatement,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
for
all
states.
i
have
to
say
that
are
differs
in
states.
some
states
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
in
most
states,
they
would
say
that.
that's
an
obligation
imposed
on
law
and
explains
why
in
a
book
to
which
i
will
refer
the
rate
book
which
mr.
manoli
thought
consisted
of
instructions
and
has
only
two
pages
of
suggestion
as
to
policy
that
is
emphasized
not
to
make
any
misrepresentation
and
that
the
reason
given
is,
that
the
company
in
maryland
as
that
happens
where
this
was
involved
is
responsible.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
are
some
states
that
have
solved
that
responsibility,
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
it
takes
safeguard.
that's
all
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say
that
is
right
but
i'd
like
to
add
to
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
except
as
the
law
adds
one
requirement
that
is
no
different
from
the
handling
of
general
motors
product
by
its
distributor
or
the
handling
of
rca
product
by
its
distributor.
what
the
law
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
what
the
board
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
was
about
to
say
and
that's
what
i
want
to
add.
what
the
law
imposes
here
is
that
the
company
is
allowed
to
sell
only
the
contract
that
is
approved
by
the
insurance
commissioner
and
that
the
rates
improved
by
the
insurance
commissioner.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honor,
i'd
rather
restrict
it
to
representations
rather
than
actions.
but,
i
may
say
that
that
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
insurance
broker
who
himself
employs
a
hundred
men,
he
is
bound
by
the
policy,
he
is
bound
by
the
rate
and
his
misrepresentation
binds
the
company
and
yet
not
even
the
board
would
hold.
we
tendered
the
testimony
here
although
it
was
rejected
of
an
independent
insurance
broker
who
himself
employs
a
large
number
of
men
and
this
is
a
very
large
offer
of
proof,
both
in
this
case
and
the
prior
case,
to
demonstrate
that
such
controls
as
there
are
here
are
precisely
the
same
as
to
him.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
agree
to
that
very
readily,
mr.
justice
fortas.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
agents
pay
their
own
accident
liability.
they
pay
their
own
burglary
insurance
in
case
the
funds
which
they
have
collected
are
stolen.
they
own
the
cars.
they
pay
the
expense
of
the
cars.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
not
at
all,
not
in
anyway.
now,
those
with
very
wide
territories,
because
of
time
and
many
elements
in
a
very
few
in
number,
get
1%
commission
on
collections
additional
but
a
great
bulk
of
agents
don't
get
that
and
they
are
never
reimbursed
in
any
way
for
the
items
that
you
have
mentioned,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
won't
emphasize
the
expertise
that
goes
into
selling
except
that
i'd
just
like
to
say
this,
your
honors,
that
these
debit
agents
sell
from
one-third
to
40%
of
all
the
ordinary,
the
non-debit
insurance
type,
the
non-industrial
life
sold
by
this
company.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
manoli
whether
debit
agents
hold
other
jobs.
mr.
manoli
answered
having
no
advance
notice,
of
course,
of
the
question
that
usually,
that
some
of
them
can
sell
other
insurance
but
usually
do
not.
well,
as
to
that
answer,
he
was
mistaken.
this
record
shows
that
the
board's
witness,
mr.
scott,
had
four
licenses
to
sell
for
other
companies;
that
he
sold
in
five
months
one
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
of
insurance
for
other
companies.
it
shows
that
mr.
spalding,
who
devotes
just
20
hours
a
week
to
his
work
for
united,
devotes
the
rest
of
his
time
to
selling
casualty
or
on
appeal
insurance
for
other
companies.
the
prior
record
to
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
gives
29
men
who
hold
licenses
and
sell
insurance
for
other
companies.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
then
followed
that
up
with
a
question,
“do
they
engage
in
other
businesses?”
and
mr.
manoli
replied,
“no”.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
with
deference
he
has
mistaken.
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
have
the
right
to
engage
in
other
businesses,
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
do.
as
this
record
show
one
witness
testified
he
is
in
the
real
estate
business.
another
runs
a
ballet
school
with
his
wife
and
as
an
actor
and
playwright.
i
may
say
that
he's
on
the
board
of
the
john
hopkins'
great
facility
in
that
field
board
of
trustees.
another
sells
general
merchandize
on
credit
and
another
sells
used
cars
and
obviously,
there
are
many
other
activities.
these
are
just
typical.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
you
mean
--
their
headquarters,
your
honor,
is
admittedly
in
this
record,
their
homes
or
portions
of
their
homes
set
apart
and
they
deduct
from
their
income
tax
for
that
use
of
their
home;
everyone
of
them.
the
prior
record
shows
that
some
of
them
rent
their
own
offices
and
pay
their
rent
and
their
telephone.
now,
the
board
conceded
that
these
men
do
not
come
to
the
district
offices
more
than
once
a
week
and
that
when
there,
they
are
not
there
more
than
two
to
four
hours
in
a
whole
week.
so,
it's
obvious,
that's
not
the
center
of
their
activity.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
come
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
first
to
present
a
weekly
report.
and
while
i'm
on
it,
i
may
as
well
get
back
straighten,
it's
not
that
complicated
difficult
accounting
report
of
great
detail
which
my
friend
has
referred
to
and
which
was
present
in
the
phoenix
case
where
everyday
they
have
to
report
the
hours,
the
people
they
saw,
their
sales,
what
they
did
hour
by
hour.
that's
one
of
the
differences
that
in
the
phoenix
case
they
were
employees
and
they
had
a
work
at
certain
number
of
hours
and
they
had
to
respect
their
hours.
whereas
here,
admittedly,
they
are
on
their
own
and
the
--
it
is
made
very
clearer
indeed
that
these
agents
have
no
restrictions
at
all.
that
the
report
that
comes
in
weekly
that
chief
justice
asked
about
is
a
report
of
the
new
business
they
sold.
obviously,
they
got
to
report
back
was
then
policies
are
assured
on
them
within
the
next
couple
of
weeks
and
every
other
phase,
it's
in
the
record
and
it's
a
one-page
report,
and
it's
their
own
computation
of
their
own
commissions
because
this
money
though
trust
funds
in
the
hands
of
an
insurance
agent,
a
general
insurance
agent,
are
not
trust
funds
in
their
hands.
they
may
use
them
for
whatever
their
purpose.
once
a
week
when
they
come
in,
they
turnover
the
net,
they
take
out
their
commission.
if
they've
settled
any
claims,
they
take
out
their
claims.
if
they
have
any
checks
they've
collected,
they
turn
in
the
checks
and
the
net
is
what
the
company
gets.
then
there
are
meetings
on
that
day
of
the
week
at
which
changes
in
the
law,
recommendations
as
to
policy
are
given
to
these
people.
they
are
very
much
the
same
as
the
general
sales
meetings
that
all
big
companies
in
america
have
for
their
distributors
except
that,
frankly,
they
occur
much
more
often.
i
mentioned
the
distributor
in
philadelphia;
rca
has
a
man
exclusively
assigned
to
that
distributor
100%
of
the
time.
that
isn't
because
they
want
to
control,
that's
what
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
their
products
are
marketed
in
the
best
possible
way.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
it
were,
you
simply
couldn't
get
enough
of
them
with
the
turnover.
but
i
would
say
that
the
success
of
the
agent
--
you
see
their
compensation
runs
from
$7,000
and
pull
or
more
to
$20,000
a
year
in
this
record.
the
success
of
the
agent
depends
on
how
quickly
he
becomes
a
specialist.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
sorry,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
show.
all
that
shows
is
that
some
were
old-time
insurance
agents
and
some
had
no
experience
at
all.
one
testified
he'd
been
in
it
for
20
or
30
years
and
actually
had
been
a
general
agent.
another
testified
he
hadn't
been
in
it
at
all.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
mr.
manoli
said
yesterday
that
there
are
3,000.
that's
not
in
the
record
but
i
would
guess
it's
about
right.
perhaps
a
low
by
two
or
three
hundred
and
involved
here
are
a
159
and
i
want
to
get
to
a
difference
because
there
were
80
in
st.
paul
street
and
79
in
franklin
street.
and
that's
really
the
difference
to
answer
mr.
justice
fortas
between
the
other
case
and
this.
now,
i
pat
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
your
honor,
that
in
maryland,
it's
$7,000
to
$20,000
a
year.
that's
very
specific.
now,
i
might
say
as
to
servicing
policies
that's
an
expert
job.
they
have
to
help
with
the
claim
forms,
they
settle
claims,
change
the
beneficiary,
cash
surrender
value,
loans,
advances,
terms
of
--
there
are
many
policies
involved,
insurable
interest,
illegibility
of
beneficiary
clause.
these
are
things
--
then
got
to
pass
an
examination
given
by
the
insurance
commissioner
before
they
can
get
their
license.
now,
i
must
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say,
your
honor,
that
the
categorical
answer
that
we
make
is
no
and
the
prior
examiners
so
found,
if
i'm
going
to
come
to
these
examiner,
admittedly
there's
no
individualized
treatment.
they
are
only
there
two
to
four
hours
and
perform
all
these
things.
there
is
a
general
meeting
at
which
company,
the
assistant
manager,
will
go
over
with
them,
developments
in
the
field.
but
that
is
advisory
and
as
i
say
it
has
its
direct
counterpart
in
the
kind
of
meetings
held
for
distributors
by
large
industries
throughout
america.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
they
will
go
over
everything
from
saying,
“you
better
be
advised
that
the
weather
report
show,
whitely
snow
next
week”;
they
will
tell
them
that
the
insurance
commissioner
has
issued
the
ruling;
they
will
say
that
the
experience
in
philadelphia
or
chicago
has
demonstrated
x
or
y
which
you
men
may
want
to
take
into
consideration.
they
are
the
kind
of
promotional
inspirational
meetings
that
you
expect
the
projector
of
a
project
to
try
to
inspire
his
independent
contractors
or
his
employees
with.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they're
used
in
both.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
say
it
or
his
employee's
salesmen.
i
say
in
either
event
that's
the
kind
of
meeting
they
have.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
certainly,
your
honor,
there's
a
great
mistake
in
this
record.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
now
there
is
evidence
on
this
record
to
this
extent.
one,
that
they
have
the
right
to;
two,
that
they
use
other
members
of
their
family.
one
man,
for
example
testified
that
his
wife
does
collect
before
hand.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
none.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
without
doubt.
now,
there's
one
who
for
example
said
that
he
hires
the
payroll
girl
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
his
original
--
when
he
comes
with
the
company,
he
has
what
is
called
the
“debit”
and
that's
a
list
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
anywhere
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
indeed
one
man
testified,
he
pursued
his
customers
outside
the
maryland
and
one
went
to
columbia
in
south
america
where
he
has
--
he
sold
the
policy.
and,
well
i
think
that
answers
your
honest
question.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
wouldn't
be
given
a
contract
here.
he
just
wouldn't
be
with
the
company.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
with
this
company?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
this
company,
of
course,
as
does
any
good
company
investigates
the
background.
these
people
going
to
home
should
get
to
be
very
careful.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
typical,
independent
contractorship.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
i
think
every
company
has
to
select
whether
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
whether
they
are
independent
contractors,
mr.
justice
black
or
employees.
the
company
is
very
foolish
that
doesn't
set
a
high
standard.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
didn't
finish
that.
the
law
is
that
you
may
not
employ
as
a
salesman
anyone
other
than
another
licensed
salesman
for
that
company.
if
i'm
licensed
to
sell
for
equitable,
i
can't
sell
for
united.
i
must
have
two
licenses.
but
as
to
the
collection,
as
to
the
servicing,
as
to
the
other
activities,
they
are
free
to
take
on
their
pick,
anyone
they
want.
now,
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
they
took
one
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
can
take
on
whom
they
want.
i
would
presume
that
if
they
took
on
a
thief,
the
company
would
have
to
say,
“if
you
want
to
employ
thieves,
your
contract
is
terminated.”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
just
as
they
would
do
with
the
distributor
of
rca.
if
he
has
thieves
going
around
the
salesman,
they
simply
will
separate
with
their
contract.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
not
all.
excuse
me?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it's
an
old
question
of
the
floor
and
the
ceiling,
mr.
justice
black.
it
doesn't
have
control.
but
when
it
gets
out
of
control,
it
can
sever
the
relationship.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
out
of
control
of
the
contractor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
are,
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
either
party.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
either
party
just
as
in
the
news
case.
i
have
a
case
right
now
for
a
distributor
with
a
$7
million
investment
where
he
was
told
on
monday
morning
he
was
out.
we're
taking
the
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
put
them
out
but
they
got
to
do
something
about
the
stock
that
he
has
on
hand.
this
is
not
peculiar
to
the
insurance
business.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and
it's
getting
more
and
more
common,
your
honor,
to
the
independent
contractor
relationship
as
big
companies
do
to
improve
transportation
and
communication
are
not
as
dependent
they
were.
this
is
why
where
rca
and
thought
of
you
can
get
an
outstanding
distributor
that
will
to
$50
million,
$60
million
a
year
business
and
have
a
building,
a
block
long
it
uses
them.
and
when
in
chicago,
it
had
to
terminate
and
then
feel
it
could
get
to
someone
else;
it
went
into
its
own
distributorship
and
formed
the
rca
distributing
company.
this
is
not
peculiar
again
to
this
business.
now,
some
have
a
month
termination
notice
but
i
don't
know
of
any
independent
contract
with
my
experience
as
a
lawyer
that
had
more
than
three
months
notice.
and
there,
there
are
people
with
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
of
investment.
now,
i
would
say
the
basic
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
is
that
the
board
takes
the
position,
that
a
debit
agent
is
generically
an
employee
and
the
court
takes
the
position
that
that
is
not
so.
the
board
pursues
with
that
at
determination
and
the
court
would
find
discrimination.
and
so,
the
board
says
in
the
phoenix
case
that
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
taking
the
word
“fine”
as
in
this
day
defining
discrimination
and
eliminating
any
onerous
aspects
of
that
may
have
a
connotation
that
it's
much
better
to
take
it
case
by
case
and
not
have
a
rule
that
applies
regardless,
a
rule
which
is
based
on
the
economic
realities.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
mr.
manoli
replied
that
united
is
the
only
holdout,
the
only
company
that
still
employs
debit
agents
as
employees.
it
just
happens.
i
know
that
it's
wrong
because
our
office
had
litigation
last
year
in
which
the
president
of
the
company
called
pilgrim
life
insurance
company
testified
that
his
debit
agents
are
independent
contractors.
i
happen
to
know
in
my
own
city
that
there
is
a
company
who
put
up
the
united
life
insurance
company
where
they
operate
as
independent
contractors
and
i've
been
informed
by
the
president
of
this
company
last
evening,
the
american
general
life
insurance
company
of
houston.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
alright.
yes.
no,
i
think
it's
the
union
is
making
my
notes.
well
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
two
things
that
curiously
were
not
mentioned
here.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
whether
the
records
weren't
really
the
same
and
i'd
like
to
say,
your
honors,
they
are
different
in
one
respect.
it
is
true
that
in
the
other
cases
the
examiners
made
that
pertinent
findings
and
they
found
the
facts
as
they
were
and
they
concluded
on
this
board's
philosophy
of
economic
realities
that
these
are
debit
agents.
but
they
said
they
are
on
their
own
and
they
have
unlimited
hours,
they
can
do
what
they
please,
they
can
work
20
hours
as
one
man
testified
or
42
hours
as
another
man
testified.
this
examiner
found
every
significant
fact
against
the
company.
and
not
only
that,
the
conceded
facts,
this
fact
that
i
mentioned,
he
just
diluted
it,
he
reduced
it,
he
said
it
applied
only
to
selling.
he
then
said
that
it
was
too
in
extent
and
he
then
said
they
have
to
work
day
and
night
anyway,
that
it's
all
around
the
clock
job
which
of
course,
it
isn't.
the
testimony
here
is
at
20
hours
to
42.
but
there
is
--
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
for
the
company
here
was
virtually
identical.
it
happens
the
same
lawyer
tried
the
cases,
it
happened
to
be
my
brother.
it
happens
that
the
same
attorney
from
the
company
was
assigned
to
the
case.
they
operate
uniformly.
there
is
a
big
difference
and
this
difference
is
franklin
street.
this
company
had
taken
over
quaker
and
incidentally,
it's
interesting
that
my
friends
do
not
even
refer
to.
the
company
took
over
the
quaker
city
life
insurance
company,
which
was
a
company
whose
debit
agents
were
clearly
employees.
they
exercise
all
controls,
they
required
the
reports
that
were
present
in
phoenix
life
and
that
we‘ve
outlined.
a
man
named
scott,
by
the
examiner's
definition,
became
the
ring
leader.
the
examiner
said
that
mr.
scott
was
obviously
partisan,
was
obviously
endeavoring
to
further
the
general
counsel's
case.
but
he
believed
scott
explicitly
and
every
single
word
he
said
and
most
of
his
words
were
different
from
both
board
witnesses
and
employee
and
employer
witnesses
or
company
witnesses
in
the
last
case.
now,
he
was
at
franklin
street
and
all
of
the
former
agents
of
the
quaker
city
life
were
at
franklin
street.
and
curiously,
this
one
witness
that
the
board
produced
and
the
witness
who
substantiated
him
as
to
these
transfers
both
came
from
franklin
street.
admittedly,
they
knew
nothing
about
st.paul
street.
we
put
on
the
assistant
manager
we
had
at
franklin
street.
obviously,
these
fellows
were
formed
as
a
group.
they
were
filing
written
demands.
they
were
endeavoring
to
frustrate
the
endeavor
to
make
them
independent
contractors.
now,
here
were
our
witnesses,
all
of
them
were
from
st.
paul
street,
which
had
been
our
traditional
office
there.
both
are
covered
here.
there
were
80
agents
there
in
79.
and
this
examined,
without
a
word
of
testimony
by
a
board
witness
what
went
on
to
st.
paul
street
simply
said
everything
scott
said
applied
to
st.
paul
street.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
no
court
could
sustain
that
and
this
court
didn't
sustain
that.
now,
the
examiner
tried
to
get
around
that
by
saying,
“no,
but
that
only
went
on
for
two
weeks
in
march
and
it
was
all
over
by
then.”
but
this
record
has
letters
in
june
and
in
september
and
it
has
the
testimony
of
mr.
forwaldt,
the
assistant
manager
who
said
things
were
chaotic
in
december
at
that
time
of
the
hearing.this
was
an
aberration.
this
was
sui
generis
at
this
one
point.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
the
examiner,
in
trying
to
gloss
it
over
as
a
part
of
a
kind
of
absolute
policy
that
he
was
going
to
write
the
one
--
he
was
going
to
write
the
one
report
decision
that
couldn't
be
reversed
by
a
court,
differed
from
all
of
his
predecessors
in
the
findings.
there's
been
one
sense
and
we
cite
the
case
in
the
footnote.
i'm
going
to
send
the
clerk
the
citation
because
it
will
show,
your
honors,
how
the
same
agents
have
been
treated
as
if
they
were
different
breeds
of
animals
in
the
four
other
trial
examiners
versus
this
one.
now,
this
examiner
did
a
remarkable
thing.
the
court
said
that
it
seriously
influenced
the
court
and
yet,
your
honors,
mr.
manoli
didn't
refer
to
it
this
morning.
mr.
groner
didn't
refer
to
it
this
morning.
the
board
brief
relegates
it
to
the
very
last
footnote
on
the
very
last
page
and
the
union
does
the
same
thing.
and
this
was
something
which
the
court
below
simply
could
not
accept.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
your
honor,
it's
a
very
major
part
of
its
decision.
the
court
below
said
that
there
was
not,
from
its
examination
of
the
records,
substantial
evidence
for
critical
facts
and
there
were
at
best
what
it
called
tenuous
support
for
others.
it
said
that
critical
findings
had
infirmities
from
the
standpoint
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence
we
support
and
it
gave
the
test
of
universal
camera
and
said
it
could
not
conscientiously
rely
on
this
examiner.
now,
then
it
gave
this
story,
it
said,
“why
is
it
that
this
examiner
believed
one
witness,
who
admittedly
know
only
about
franklin
street
and
disbelieved
all
the
others
who
testified
about
a
wholly
different
location?”
and
he
said
“that
he
was
undoubtedly
influenced
by
the
fact
that
he
said
as
he
observed
these
not
witnesses
but
debit
agents,
both
those
who
testified
and
those
who
didn't
in
the
courtroom,
he
called
it
on
and
off
the
stand
demeanor”.
as
he
observed
their
demeanor,
they
showed
--
i'd
like
to
read
that
to
your
honors.
“they
showed
a
servile
attitude.”
they
showed
something
--
let
just
if
i
may
read
that
to
your
honor.
i
have
that
right
here.
here
it
is.
“they
showed
a
marked
deference
beyond
the
sometimes
illusive
requirements
of
courtesy.”
he
said
that
“they
failed
to
show
in
their
off
the
stand
and
on
the
stand
attitude,
a
demeanor
of
independence.”
and
he
said,
“typical
of
what
happened,
his
attitude
was
when
there
was
stipulated
that
six
witnesses,
six
debit
agents
wouldn't
testify,
they
just
identified
themselves
and
the
testimony
would
be
the
same
as
the
other”.
he
said,
“while
being
deprived
of
their
‘moments
of
the
glory'”.
and
this
was
his
all
attitude
towards
these
debit
agents.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
“moments
of
glory”
is
877
if
it
please
your
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
and
the
--
but
the
important
matter,
your
honor,
that
demeanor
testimony,
you
will
find
it
on
page
1151,
i
mean
the
demeanor
statement,
1151
in
footnote
26,
which
starts
on
that
page;
it's
a
very
long
footnote.
then
he
says,
he
makes
the
significant
finding.
he
terms
it
a
“finding”
that
i
just
read
to
your
honors.
and
then
in
the
text,
he
says,
that
“he
uses
this
in
conjunction
with
other
and
themselves
sufficient
basis
for
all
of
these
findings”.
now
what
is
the
board
do
with
that?
the
board
puts
that
in
a
footnote
too.
and
the
board
says,
--
the
board
says,
“we
do
not,”
one
sentence,
“we
do
not
rely
on
the
trial
examiner's
observation
as
set
out
in
the
footnote,”
observation.
now,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
by
saying
they
don't
agree
with
the
observation
in
the
footnote,
i
don't
know
whether
they
mean
they
don't
agree
with
the
“finding”,
so
label
the
finding
by
the
examiner.
but
it
isn't
just
the
footnote.
the
text
says
that,
“as
he
observed
the
debit
agents
in
eight
days
of
hearings,”
well,
our
people
run
stand
only
five
days,
so
his
textual
reference
has
to
be
off
the
stand
as
well
and
he
says
that,
his
observation,
he
is
using
that
support
for
“my
findings”.
and
i
submit,
that
the
court
then
said,
“we
can't
do
that.”
the
whole
thing
is
tainted.
this
whole
attitude,
the
reason
he
had
said
these
people
are
unworthy
of
belief
is
because
they
are
saying
things
which
label
them
as
independent
contractors
and
his
view
is,
that
they're
servile,
that
they
don't
show
ordinary
independence
as
they
walk
around
the
courtroom.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
your
honor.
he
didn't
swear
himself
and
he
rode
a
very
learned
discourse
on
why
off
the
stand,
demeanor
was
proper.
and
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
that's
a
short
form
of
order.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
rather
defer
to
mr.
manoli.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
usually
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
yes,
and
the
court
very,
very
conscientiously
went
into
why.
the
court
pointed
out
that
you
cannot
split
up
a
man's
mind
in
two
segments.
and
say,
well,
we
know
he
wasn't
influenced
although
we
said
he
was.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
court
under
these
circumstances,
since
my
time
is
almost
up,
this
court
under
these
circumstances
applied
the
rule
of
the
universal
camera
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh!
your
honor,
all
the
evidence
they
gave
in
the
other
cases.
they
gave
evidences
to
the
fact
that
there
are
hours
of
work
are
free.
there
are
1,500
pages,
i
guess
of
evidence.
12,000
pages
of
evidence.
they
went
through
the
fact.
they
own
their
own
automobiles.
they
thought
what
the
answers
that
i
gave
to
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
why
sure
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
said
--
he
specifically
found
that
the
1%
that
a
few
agents
get
is
for
transportation
and
he
disregarded
the
rest.
he
never
mentions
that
in
his
opinion,
your
honor,
if
it's
not
important.
the
reinstatement
says
that
that
is
a
factor,
that's
important.
he
disregards
it.
he
never
even
mentions
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
didn't
say
that
but
he
said
that
they're
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
the
evidence
is
vigorously
in
dispute.
and
that's
what
i
stored
out
by.
that's
where
i
disagree
with
my
friends.
that's
why
they
take
so
much
time
to
go
through
the
facts
and
that's
why
we
do
so.
and,
if
may,
your
honors,
simply
say
that
in
the
scope
of
review,
this
court
faithfully
and
loyally
followed
universal
camera.
the
court
made
it
very
clear
and
i
might
i
say
that
here,
the
brief
is
perfectly
clear
of
the
board
that
it
wants
to
return
to
warrant
in
law
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
law.
well,
this
court
said
on
that
point
unanimously
in
universal
camera
and
in
pittsburg
steamship
that
that
is
no
longer
the
test.
and
i
submit
that
the
court,
having
followed
the
standard,
having
reviewed
the
finding,
having
found
it
couldn't
conscientiously
rely
was
in
this
posture.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
for
this
court,
“where
we
called
upon
to
pass
on
the
boards
conclusions
in
the
first
instance,
or
to
make
an
independent
review,
of
the
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
might
well
support
the
boards
conclusion
and
reject
that
of
the
court
below.
but
congress
has
charged
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
this
court,
with
normal
and
primary
responsibility
for
granting
or
denying
enforcement
orders.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
having
applied
the
test
under
the
mandate
of
the
act,
having
followed
faithfully
the
universal
camera's
scope
of
review,
the
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
