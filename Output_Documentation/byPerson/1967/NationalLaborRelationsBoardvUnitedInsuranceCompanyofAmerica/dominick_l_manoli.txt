mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
act
excludes
from
the
term
“employees”
and
therefore,
from
the
protection
that
employs
have
under
the
statute.
it
includes
from
that
term
any
individual
having
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor.
the
board
found
that
the
debit
agents
of
the
respondent
insurance
company
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors,
and
that
therefore
the
company
violated
the
statute
when
it
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
the
board
has
certified
as
the
agent’s
partly
represented.
the
court
below,
on
the
other
hand,
held
that
the
debit
agents
were
independent
contractors
and
not
employees,
and
that
therefore
the
company
was
under
no
obligation
to
recognize
or
(voice
overlap)
with
the
union.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
board
properly
determined
that
these
agents
are
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
whether
the
court
below
in
displacing
that
judgment
with
its
own
judgment
has
overstepped
its
reviewing
function.
i
think
its
not
unfair
to
say
that
the
facts
which
underlie
the
dispute,
and
putting
to
one
side
some
argumentative
shadings
that
there
really
is
no
significant
dispute
as
what
the
basic
facts
are
that
give
rise
to
this
controversy
in
which
i
think
in
the
final
analysis,
will
govern
its
disposition.
the
record
here
is
a
very
lengthy
one
and
well,
i
very
much
regret
in
giving
the
court
a
rather
lengthy
summary
of
the
facts.
i
think
that
a
full
understanding
of
those
cases
requires
a
summary
of
the
facts
no
longer
than
usual.
the
company
is
engaged
in
the
sale
of
life
and
health
and
accident
insurance
through
its
district
offices
located
in
various
states.
every
district
office
has
a
manager
and
several
assistant
managers.
each
assistant
manager
is
in-charge
of
the
staff
of
four
or
five
of
these
debit
agents
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
company
has
a
compliment
of
approximately
3,000
debit
agents
and
involved
in
these
proceedings
are
approximately
150
of
these
agents
who
are
attached
to
the
company’s
district
offices
in
baltimore.
the
company
hires
the
debit
agents
and
assigns
them
to
a
particular
district
office.
a
debit
agent
deals
mainly
with
the
industrial
insurance.
this
type
of
insurance,
unlike
the
ordinary
or
commercial
insurance,
involves
smaller
coverage
usually
a
thousand
dollars
or
less,
and
provides
for
the
payment
of
premiums
on
a
weekly
basis.
the
agent's
job
is
to
collect
premiums
from
the
holders
of
these
policies
in
a
relatively
concentrated
geographic
area
to
prevent
the
lapsing
of
policies
and
the
sales
of
such
a
new
insurance
as
time
allows.
he
spends
most
of
his
time
collecting
premiums
from
the
policy
holders
whom
he
serves.
the
agents
need
not
have
any
prior
training
or
experience
that
are
trained
by
company’s
supervisory
personnel.
the
company's
supplies
them
with
a
so-called,
and
i
might
say
a
misnamed
great
book
which
contains
detailed
and
comprehensive
instructions
how
to
perform
many
of
their
duties,
requires
them
to
file
weekly
and
other
periodic
reports
with
respect
to
their
premiums
collected,
the
increase
or
decrease
in
business,
lapses,
and
so
on.
the
company
reviews
his
reports,
requires
changes
if
necessary
and
approves
them
and
correct.
the
agents
do
business
in
the
company's
name.
the
company
provides
them
with
the
debit
book
which
contains
the
names
of
the
policy
--
names
of
the
policy
holders
the
agent
has
to
serve,
the
insurance
policies,
various
forms
and
sales
promotion
literature.
although
the
agents
may
be
licensed
to
sell
other
company's
insurance
and
sometimes
do
such
sales
are
infrequent.
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
they
operate
and
the
compensation
which
they
received
are
promulgated
unilaterally
by
the
company.
their
compensation
is
based
primarily
upon
a
percentage
commission
of
the
premiums
collected.
the
agents
participate
in
the
company's
group
insurance
and
profit
sharing
pension
fund
which
the
company
has
established
for
the
benefit
of
employees.
they
also
enjoy
what
is
essentially
a
vacation
pay
plan
under
which
the
agent
may
take
one
or
two
weeks
off,
depending
on
his
length
of
service.
they
have
a
permanent
working
arrangement
with
the
company
under
which
they
may
continue
as
long
as
their
performance
is
satisfactory.
the
agents
perform
their
work
primarily
away
from
the
company's
offices.
they
do
not
have
regular
offices
for
which
they
pay
rent.
although
some
set
aside
workspace
in
their
homes
and
deduct
the
maintenance
involved
for
tax
purposes.
however,
they
regularly
report
to
the
district
office
once
each
week
in
order
to
turnover
premiums
collected,
to
file
weekly
reports
and
to
attend
staff
meetings.
the
agents
have
no
employs.
from
time
to
time
the
assistant
manager
accompanies
an
agent
on
his
rounds
among
the
policy
holders
in
his
debit.
if
the
agent
is
ill
or
absent,
his
assistant
manager
services
his
debit.
the
agents
may
fix
their
own
hours
of
work
and
workdays
but
since
the
company
expects
him
to
obtain
a
high
percentage
of
collections
and
to
avoid
policy
lapses,
and
to
bring
in
new
business,
it
is
evident
that
they
must
be
diligent
in
the
performance
of
their
functions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
just
said
a
moment
ago,
your
honor,
if
they
are
licensed
to
sell
insurance
for
some
other
company,
they
may
sell
insurance
for
some
other
companies.
but
apparently,
that's
--
those
sales
are
minimum,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
record
does
not
show
they
hold
any
other
jobs
in
any
other
capacity.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
that
there's
anything
on
the
record
with
respect
to
that.
the
company
may
terminate
the
relationship
at
will.
now,
the
degree
of
control,
which
the
company
exercises
over
the
agents
is
best
perhaps
some
gap
in
the
words
of
the
company's
board's
chairman.
in
a
letter
read
to
some
of
the
agents
which
was
critical
of
the
agent's
failure
to
make
certain
reports
of
the
company,
he
declared,
if
any
agent
believes
he
has
the
power
to
make
his
own
rules
and
plan
of
handling
the
company's
business,
then
that
agent
should
hand
his
resignation
at
once.
and
if
we
learned
that
said
agent
is
not
going
to
operate
in
accordance
with
the
company's
plan,
then
the
company
would
be
forced
to
make
the
agents
final
that
means
dismissal.
we
would
not
allow
anyone
to
interfere
with
us
in
our
successful
plan.
so
much
for
the
facts
of
this
case,
let's
say
it's
a
little
bit
lengthy
than
usual,
without
having
gone
into
some
degree,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
appreciate
what
our
problem
is
in
this
case.
as
i
stated,
the
very
beginning
of
my
discussion,
the
labor
act
excludes
from
the
definition
of
employees
individuals
who
have
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor.
the
statute
does
not
define
either
terms,
either
the
term
employer
or
the
term
independent
contractor.
congress
incorporated
this
specific
exclusion
of
contractors,
independent
contractors
in
the
1947
amendments.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
and
i'll
come
to
hearst
eventually.
the
--
of
course,
under
the
original
wagner
act,
the
term
“employee”
impliedly
excluded
independent
contractors.
the
problem
under
the
old
act,
the
problem
under
the
new
act,
has
always
been
where
the
draw
of
the
line
between
the
employer
and
employee
and
an
independent
contractor.
what
the
test
is
to
govern
the
--
he
has
to
govern
the
drawing
of
that
line
and
this
application
of
that
test
to
specific
situations.
now,
in
the
hearst
case
which
was
decided
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
which
was
decided
by
the
1947
amendment,
this
court
rejected
their
contention
that
in
drawing
the
line
between
employees
and
an
independent
contractors,
technical
common
law
standards
would
apply
exclusively.
it
held
instead
that
employee
status
or
independent
contractor
status
was
to
be
determined
upon
the
basis
of
the
underlying
economic
realities
of
the
relationship
in
the
light
of
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute
and
their
effectuation.
congress
disapproved
of
this
ruling
and
in
1947,
it
expressly
excluded
in
order
to
carry
out
the
disapproval
of
the
hearst
decision
and
expressly
excluded
from
the
statute
of
independent
contractors
from
the
term
“employee
--
independent
contractors”.
and
in
the
legislative
history,
it
made
clear
its
intention
that
the
term
employee
or
independent
contractor
was
to
be
defined
on
the
basis
of
general
agency
principles.
now,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
should
--
the
status
of
those
news
boys?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
they
thought
that
--
their
criticism
of
this
court's
decision
was
that
it
left
to
the
board
pretty
much
at
large.
pretty
much
at
large
or
without
any
standard
at
all
to
determine
who
is
going
--
who
was
an
employee
and
who
was
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
it
would.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
indeed,
this
court
itself
in
hearst
did
not
say
that
those
news
boys
would
not
have
satisfied
agency
principles.
but
it
took
the
occasion
of
that
case
of
course,
to
deal
with
the
very
larger
problem
of
what
the
proper
test
would
be
under
the
statute.
now,
it
is
trite
for
me
to
say
that
under
the
--
that
these
agency
principles
that
are
to
govern
the
task
of
determining
who
is
an
employee
and
who
is
an
independent
contractor,
it
is
trite
for
me
to
say
that
they
don't
furnish
us
with
any
simple
formula
that's
going
to
solve
our
problem
in
a
very
easy
fashion.
under
those
principles,
it
seems
that
in
large
measure,
the
decision
turns
upon
the
scope
and
extent
of
control
that
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed,
their
control
which
he
exercises
or
that
control
which
he
may
exercise
over
the
performance
of
the
job
or
of
the
service.
now
i
think
it
is
common
ground
among
us
here
at
counsel
table
that
in
assessing
the
requisite
degree
of
con
--
of
this
kind
of
control
that
no
single
factor,
no
single
element
of
the
relationship
between
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed
or
fellow
who
is
performing
this
service
that
no
single
element
is
decisive
but
that
all
of
the
elements,
their
relationship
must
be
taken
into
account
and
it
is
the
total
situation
that
governs.
now,
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency
which
we
all
cite
incidentally
and
rely
on,
we
all
come
--
cite
pretty
much
the
same
thing
but
come
to
different
conclusions.
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency,
among
the
relevant
factors
which
it
lists,
which
are
significant
for
determining
that
kind
of
control
whether
it's
employee
status
or
independent
contractors,
it
lists
among
other
things
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
control
over
the
details
of
the
work
by
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed,
whether
the
person
who
is
performing
the
service
is
engaged
in
a
distinct
occupation
or
business
or
whether
the
work
that
he
is
doing
is
an
integral
part
of
the
daily
business,
operations
of
the
person
for
whom
he
is
performing
the
service.
the
continuity
of
the
duration
of
the
relationship
between
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
performed,
fellows
performing
the
service,
the
method
of
compensation
and
i
believe
that
some
others
listed
there.
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
a
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
obviously
this
is
an
area
in
which
there
is
going
to
be
an
enormous
infinite
variety
of
factual
situation,
and
obviously
decision
as
to
status
is
going
to
call
for
discretion,
for
judgment
and
i
might
even
say
for
some
intuitive
judgment.
we
believe
that
the
board's
overall
appraisal
of
the
overall
situation
here
is
--
as
its
judgment
and
its
judgment
of
these
--
in
agents
--
that
these
debit
agents
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors
is
wholly
reasonable
and
within
the
framework
of
the
legal
test
of
this
agency
principles.
in
the
first
place,
these
agents
do
have
a
relatively
and
continuing
relationship
with
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
unilaterally
promulgates
the
terms
and
conditions
of
their
service.
three,
these
agents
make
no
investments
in
the
business
and
they
have
no
independent
business
establishment.
four,
they
have
no
prior
experience
or
training
is
--
as
it
is
required
in
order
to
have
one
of
these
jobs.
they
assume
no
risk
of
profit,
no
risk
of
loss,
nor
the
possibility
--
and
know
the
posibilty
of
profit
beyond
the
premiums
which
they
collect
upon
under
insurance.
their
work
obviously
is
an
integral
part
of
the
company's
business
of
selling
insurance
and
servicing
its
policyholders.
the
collection
of
premiums
which
constitutes
the
major
part
of
the
work
which
these
business
agents
performed
is
routine
and
clerical.
the
nature
of
the
company's
business,
the
supervision
which
that
business
--
which
the
assistant
managers
exercise
over
these
debit
agents,
they're
reporting
and
acquiring
--
a
kind
of
requirements
which
these
agents
must
follow
and
the
diligence
in
the
industry
which
these
agents
must
demonstrate
in
order
to
properly
service
their
debt,
all
these
combined
to
indicate
that
these
agents
have
very
little
leeway
in
the
exercise
of
any
real
discretion
or
any
real
freedom
of
action
in
their
performances
or
functions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is.
it's
a
--
there
are
--
in
the
early
days,
the
wagner
act,
a
number
of
insurance
companies
pressed
the
same
issue
before
the
board
that
these
people
were
not
employed
or
not
independent
contractors.
but
the
board
has
uniformly
held
that
these
debit
agents
throughout
the
industry
are
employees
and
the
industry
has
at
large
measure
acquiesced,
i
think
perhaps
united
is
the
only
holdout.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
that
the
board
has
had
but
there
are
other
types
of
agents
obviously
were
may
be
quite
different
from
these
debit
agents,
from
the
debit
--
from
these
debit
agents,
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
board
has
had
a
--
at
the
moment,
i
don't
recall.
it
may
well
have
had
insurance
policy,
people
selling
insurance
other
than
debt
--
in
debit
agents.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
you
did
but
they
involved
unit
questions.
we
had
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
cases,
oh,
cases
under
the
labor
board?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
those
were
here
couple
of
terms
ago
and
it
involved
questions
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit.
there
was
no
issue
there
as
to
whether
or
not
the
debit
agents
were
employees.
nobody
was
disputing
that
the
debit
agents
involved
in
those
cases
were
employees
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
those
cases
involved
debit
agents
of
insurance
companies.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
these
people
on
the
trade
are
called
debit
agents.
these
people
whose
service
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there's
been
no
case
before
this
board
--
under
the
labor
--
before
this
court.
under
the
labor
act
as
to
the
status
of
these
insurance
agents
other
than
this
one
here
your
honor.
the
--
now,
to
be
sure,
these
agents
in
the
sense
are
on
their
own.
they
do
work
primarily
away
from
the
company's
district
office
and
apart
from
reporting
weekly
to
their
regional
office,
except
on
rare
occasions,
they
do
--
they
may
fix
their
own
hours
of
work
and
their
workdays.
but
we
submit
that
the
board
could
recently
discount
the
seeming
elements
of
independence
in
the
context
of
the
entire
picture
which
i
submit.
the
board
properly
found,
reflects
a
pervasive
control
and
supervision
over
every
aspect
of
the
agent's
functions
and
performance.
now,
the
company
argues
that
the
board
in
this
case
and
another
cases
that
its
judgment
in
this
case
and
other
case
at
bottom
rest
upon
a
continuing
adherence
to
the
hearst
case.
i
submitted
that
that
argument
is
ill-found.
of
course,
in
the
nature
of
the
problem,
in
the
nature
of
the
problem,
they
are
bound
to
be
common
factors
which
will
play
a
role
under
both
tests.
the
agency
principle
test
and
the
hearst
test
in
the
gray
area,
and
so
many
this
gray
area,
where's
going
to
be
a
difference
but
the
two
tests
may
make
a
difference,
in
the
gray
area
where
one
test
or
the
other
may
dictate
a
different
result.
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
distinction
between
the
two
tests,
the
economic
reality,
so
called
economic
reality
test
of
hearst,
and
the
agency
principles
does
not,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
said
in
another
context
does
not
present
a
glaringly
bright
line.
but
under
both
test,
you
do
take
into
account
all
of
the
elements
of
the
service
relationship.
the
differences
between
the
two
tests
that
under
hearst
in
the
closed
case
and
i
repeat
again
that
that's
the
only
area
where
these
two
tests
may
make
a
difference.
“that
in
the
close
case
which
may
fall
short
under
its
--
under
agency
principles
of
establishing
an
employee
status
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
under
the
hearst
test,
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
effectuation
of
those
policies
will
suffice
to
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
finding
that
that
person
is
an
employee.
now,
the
board
has
repeatedly
acknowledged
since
1947
that
agency
principles
do
in
fact
govern
its
determination
of
employee's
status
and
i
have
sought
to
explain,
i
believe
that
this
decision
in
this
case
does
come
forth
with
those
--
or
with
the
--
those
principles.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
thrust
of
the
company's
argument
on
this
leg
of
the
case
is
that
the
board
has
given
undue
weight
to
certain
factors
which
are
indicative
of
employee's
status
and
discarded
those
which
the
company
says
--
it
says,
point
the
other
way.
but
obviously
we
are
in
an
area
whether
there
will
be
differences
of
judgment
as
to
how
much
weight
is
to
be
given
to
one
factor
as
against
another
in
arriving
at
a
balanced
judgment.
but
i
submit
that
the
board's
judgment
in
this
case
is
vulnerable
to
attack
only
if
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
the
overall
evaluation
that
it
is
made
is
unreasonable
and
not
within
the
general
framework
of
this
agency
principles.
i
want
to
come
to
the
second
leg
of
my
argument
here
and
that
is
--
deal
with
what
the
court
below
has
done.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
in
displacing
the
board's
judgment
of
this
case
as
the
status
of
these
debit
agents
has
misapplied
or
misconceived
these
agency
principles,
and
has
over-stepped
the
proper
bounds
of
its
reviewing
function.
the
court
below
implicitly,
if
not
expressly,
and
recognized
that
the
company
does
exercise
a
substantial
degree
of
supervision
and
control
over
these
debit
agents.
but
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
said
that
in
determining
statutes
you
look
to
the
total
situation.
the
court
below
completely
neutralized
these
elements
of
control
and
supervision
which
the
company
does
in
fact
exercise
and
which
the
court
below,
i
think,
they
in
fact
does
recognize.
it
completely
neutralized
those
because
they
are
inherent
in
its
business
operations.
the
court
says
that
since
business
necessity
may
require
some
of
these
controls,
some
of
the
supervisions
you
simply
neutralize.
the
board
should
not
give
any
weight
at
all
to
those
particular
factors.
and
then
having
said
that,
the
court
then
look
at
the
fact
that
these
employees
are
under
own
in
the
sense
that
they
work
away
from
their
district
office,
that
they
may
select
their
own
hours,
and
gave
that
fact
a
decisive
weight.
but
we
submit
your
honors,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
court
to
discount
elements
of
control
and
supervision
which
the
company
does
in
fact
exercise
simply
because
business
necessity
requires
such
control
and
supervision
or
because
they
may
be
inherent
in
the
operation
of
the
company's
business.
it
is
--
if
those
controls
do
exist,
yet
that
such
supervision
does
exist
as
would
indicate
employee
status,
then
it's
irrelevant
what
the
reason
or
the
source
for
those
controls
may
be.
they
do
remain
a
fact
of
life,
and
they
should
be
weighed
in
the
balance
in
order
to
determine
an
overall
evaluation
whether
or
not
these
people
are
or
not
employees.
finally,
the
--
your
honor,
i
see
there's
one
more
minute
left.
i
have
about
five
more
minutes
to
go.
shall
i
stop
at
this
point?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alright
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
inquired
about
some
insurance
salesman
cases
in
this
court
and
i
mentioned
that
we
had
had
one
metropolitan
life
insurance
case
not
too
long
ago
and
that
that
case
involves
question
of
unit.
through
some
somewhat
curious
lapse
of
memory,
mr.
justice
black,
i
forgot
to
mention
one
other
case.
i
say
curious
lapse
of
memory
because
i
argued
it
and
since
i've
lost
it,
that's
probably
why
i
don't
want
to
remember
it.
but
that
was
the
insurance
agent,
the
prudential
insurance
agent's
case
which
is
also
cited
--
both
these
cases
certainly
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
one
was
on
361
477
and
i'm
sure
mr.
justice
brennan
will
recall
that
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
--
in
the
first
case,
the
prudential
insurance
case
you
had
involved
there
some
debit
agents.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
employees.
they
had
engaged
in
some
intimate
and
work
staff.
but
there's
in
the
question
there
was
whether
those
intimate
work
staff
is
constituted
bad
faith
bargaining
on
the
part
of
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
so
assumed
but
i
don't
want
to
raise
the
issue.
have
the
issue
was
not
–-
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
in
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
case,
that
too
involved
debit
agents
and
there
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
unit
which
the
board
had
fund
was
inappropriate
collective
bargaining
unit.
in
that
case,
it
was
conceded
that
they
were
employees.
now,
in
the
remaining
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
my
final
part
of
my
discussion.
yesterday,
i
sought
to
explain
that
the
board's
judgment
that
these
debit
agents
are
employees
under
the
meaning
of
the
act
is
reasonable
and
wholly
within
the
framework
of
the
applicable
governing
test.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
in
displacing
the
board's
judgment
as
the
status
of
these
agents
has,
as
i
said
yesterday
not
only
misconceived
the
controlling
test
but
we
also
think
that
it
has
overstepped
the
bounds
of
judicial
review.
this
court
has
often
said
that
problems
of
definition
of
status
have
been
wisely
committed
by
congress
to
the
expert
agency
as
created
and
not
to
the
courts.
the
company
argues
that
since
the
controlling
test
here
is
a
common
law
test,
that
the
board
has
no
special
expertise
in
this
area
and
that
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
owes
the
board
no
particular
deference
in
applying
such
a
standard.
but
i
suggest
your
honors
that
the
question
involved,
the
problem
involved
is
not
simply
one
of
law
but
rather
the
application
of
a
statutory
term
to
a
variety,
an
infinite
variety
of
factual
situations.
and
in
that
area
--
in
that
area,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
board
for
administering
the
statute
is
singularly
appropriate
and
this
court
only
recently
said,
“universal
camera
is
not
an
invitation
to
disregard
that
primacy.”
indeed,
universal
camera
says
that
even
in
areas
where
the
board
does
not
possessed
any
special
competence
or
expertise
that
the
board's
choice
of
two
fairly
conflicting
views
is
to
be
respected
by
a
reviewing
court
even
though
the
reviewing
court,
upon
the
de
novo
consideration
of
the
matter
might
have
fairly
and
reasonably
come
out
with
the
adequate
way,
the
other
conclusion.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
yesterday
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
say
this.
the
principal
criticism
that
both
the
house
and
the
senate
had
with
respect
to
the
hearst
cases
as
i
see
it,
the
thrust
of
their
criticism
was
that
they
thought
that
this
court
here
had
pretty
much
left
the
board
at
large
in
determining
whether
or
not
individual
for
employees
and
for
the
contractors
without
any
definite
standard.
and
in
the
house
conference
report,
the
court
--
it
was
said
there,
conference
report,
speaking
of
hearst
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
think
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
sure
that
the
board
would
be
applying
agency
rules
--
agency
rules
in
determining
the
status.
but
the
fact
that
they
adopted
a
common
law
rule
doesn't
mean
that
in
the
application
of
that
rule
that
the
board
was
not
to
have
the
usual
area
of
discretion
of
judgment
that
it
ordinarily
has
in
the
application
of
statutory
terms
to
particular
specific
situations.
now,
the
--
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
universal
camera,
universal
camera
as
this
court
said,
is
an
invitation
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
disregard
that
premise
in
the
application
of
a
specific
statutory
term
to
specific
situations.
it's
very
much
the
same
in
the
case
of
a
supervisor
to
be
sure
that
the
supervisor
is
not
a
common
law
term
but
congress
in
the
act
has
defined
the
various
incidents
that
established
supervisory
status.
and
repeatedly,
the
courts
have
said
that
that's
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
board
to
apply
that
definition,
to
apply
that
definition
to
a
specific
situation.
and
incidentally,
i
might
mention
that
unlike
this
case
here,
the
seventh
circuit
itself
has
paid
that
kind
of
difference
to
the
board
and
the
application
of
the
terms
“supervisor”
to
a
specific
situation.
now,
to
say
the
board
has
no
special
competence
in
this
area,
i
think
merely
overlooks
what
the
board
does.
the
board
has
these
situations
almost
daily.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
the
boards,
volumes
dealing
with
the
employees'
status
within
the
independent
contractors'
status,
with
supervisors'
status,
all
kinds
of
shadings,
all
these
various
and
almost
infinite
different
situations.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
surely,
that
experience
makes
for
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
in
the
words
of
this
court
is
entirely
the
usual
difference
by
a
reviewing
court
to
the
board
expertise
in
applying
specific
statutory
provisions
to
specific
situations.
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
often
does
have
short
form
of
decision
at
that
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
act
excludes
from
the
term
“employees”
and
therefore,
from
the
protection
that
employs
have
under
the
statute.
it
includes
from
that
term
any
individual
having
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor.
the
board
found
that
the
debit
agents
of
the
respondent
insurance
company
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors,
and
that
therefore
the
company
violated
the
statute
when
it
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
the
board
has
certified
as
the
agent’s
partly
represented.
the
court
below,
on
the
other
hand,
held
that
the
debit
agents
were
independent
contractors
and
not
employees,
and
that
therefore
the
company
was
under
no
obligation
to
recognize
or
(voice
overlap)
with
the
union.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
board
properly
determined
that
these
agents
are
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
whether
the
court
below
in
displacing
that
judgment
with
its
own
judgment
has
overstepped
its
reviewing
function.
i
think
its
not
unfair
to
say
that
the
facts
which
underlie
the
dispute,
and
putting
to
one
side
some
argumentative
shadings
that
there
really
is
no
significant
dispute
as
what
the
basic
facts
are
that
give
rise
to
this
controversy
in
which
i
think
in
the
final
analysis,
will
govern
its
disposition.
the
record
here
is
a
very
lengthy
one
and
well,
i
very
much
regret
in
giving
the
court
a
rather
lengthy
summary
of
the
facts.
i
think
that
a
full
understanding
of
those
cases
requires
a
summary
of
the
facts
no
longer
than
usual.
the
company
is
engaged
in
the
sale
of
life
and
health
and
accident
insurance
through
its
district
offices
located
in
various
states.
every
district
office
has
a
manager
and
several
assistant
managers.
each
assistant
manager
is
in-charge
of
the
staff
of
four
or
five
of
these
debit
agents
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
company
has
a
compliment
of
approximately
3,000
debit
agents
and
involved
in
these
proceedings
are
approximately
150
of
these
agents
who
are
attached
to
the
company’s
district
offices
in
baltimore.
the
company
hires
the
debit
agents
and
assigns
them
to
a
particular
district
office.
a
debit
agent
deals
mainly
with
the
industrial
insurance.
this
type
of
insurance,
unlike
the
ordinary
or
commercial
insurance,
involves
smaller
coverage
usually
a
thousand
dollars
or
less,
and
provides
for
the
payment
of
premiums
on
a
weekly
basis.
the
agent's
job
is
to
collect
premiums
from
the
holders
of
these
policies
in
a
relatively
concentrated
geographic
area
to
prevent
the
lapsing
of
policies
and
the
sales
of
such
a
new
insurance
as
time
allows.
he
spends
most
of
his
time
collecting
premiums
from
the
policy
holders
whom
he
serves.
the
agents
need
not
have
any
prior
training
or
experience
that
are
trained
by
company’s
supervisory
personnel.
the
company's
supplies
them
with
a
so-called,
and
i
might
say
a
misnamed
great
book
which
contains
detailed
and
comprehensive
instructions
how
to
perform
many
of
their
duties,
requires
them
to
file
weekly
and
other
periodic
reports
with
respect
to
their
premiums
collected,
the
increase
or
decrease
in
business,
lapses,
and
so
on.
the
company
reviews
his
reports,
requires
changes
if
necessary
and
approves
them
and
correct.
the
agents
do
business
in
the
company's
name.
the
company
provides
them
with
the
debit
book
which
contains
the
names
of
the
policy
--
names
of
the
policy
holders
the
agent
has
to
serve,
the
insurance
policies,
various
forms
and
sales
promotion
literature.
although
the
agents
may
be
licensed
to
sell
other
company's
insurance
and
sometimes
do
such
sales
are
infrequent.
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
they
operate
and
the
compensation
which
they
received
are
promulgated
unilaterally
by
the
company.
their
compensation
is
based
primarily
upon
a
percentage
commission
of
the
premiums
collected.
the
agents
participate
in
the
company's
group
insurance
and
profit
sharing
pension
fund
which
the
company
has
established
for
the
benefit
of
employees.
they
also
enjoy
what
is
essentially
a
vacation
pay
plan
under
which
the
agent
may
take
one
or
two
weeks
off,
depending
on
his
length
of
service.
they
have
a
permanent
working
arrangement
with
the
company
under
which
they
may
continue
as
long
as
their
performance
is
satisfactory.
the
agents
perform
their
work
primarily
away
from
the
company's
offices.
they
do
not
have
regular
offices
for
which
they
pay
rent.
although
some
set
aside
workspace
in
their
homes
and
deduct
the
maintenance
involved
for
tax
purposes.
however,
they
regularly
report
to
the
district
office
once
each
week
in
order
to
turnover
premiums
collected,
to
file
weekly
reports
and
to
attend
staff
meetings.
the
agents
have
no
employs.
from
time
to
time
the
assistant
manager
accompanies
an
agent
on
his
rounds
among
the
policy
holders
in
his
debit.
if
the
agent
is
ill
or
absent,
his
assistant
manager
services
his
debit.
the
agents
may
fix
their
own
hours
of
work
and
workdays
but
since
the
company
expects
him
to
obtain
a
high
percentage
of
collections
and
to
avoid
policy
lapses,
and
to
bring
in
new
business,
it
is
evident
that
they
must
be
diligent
in
the
performance
of
their
functions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
just
said
a
moment
ago,
your
honor,
if
they
are
licensed
to
sell
insurance
for
some
other
company,
they
may
sell
insurance
for
some
other
companies.
but
apparently,
that's
--
those
sales
are
minimum,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
record
does
not
show
they
hold
any
other
jobs
in
any
other
capacity.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
that
there's
anything
on
the
record
with
respect
to
that.
the
company
may
terminate
the
relationship
at
will.
now,
the
degree
of
control,
which
the
company
exercises
over
the
agents
is
best
perhaps
some
gap
in
the
words
of
the
company's
board's
chairman.
in
a
letter
read
to
some
of
the
agents
which
was
critical
of
the
agent's
failure
to
make
certain
reports
of
the
company,
he
declared,
if
any
agent
believes
he
has
the
power
to
make
his
own
rules
and
plan
of
handling
the
company's
business,
then
that
agent
should
hand
his
resignation
at
once.
and
if
we
learned
that
said
agent
is
not
going
to
operate
in
accordance
with
the
company's
plan,
then
the
company
would
be
forced
to
make
the
agents
final
that
means
dismissal.
we
would
not
allow
anyone
to
interfere
with
us
in
our
successful
plan.
so
much
for
the
facts
of
this
case,
let's
say
it's
a
little
bit
lengthy
than
usual,
without
having
gone
into
some
degree,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
appreciate
what
our
problem
is
in
this
case.
as
i
stated,
the
very
beginning
of
my
discussion,
the
labor
act
excludes
from
the
definition
of
employees
individuals
who
have
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor.
the
statute
does
not
define
either
terms,
either
the
term
employer
or
the
term
independent
contractor.
congress
incorporated
this
specific
exclusion
of
contractors,
independent
contractors
in
the
1947
amendments.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
and
i'll
come
to
hearst
eventually.
the
--
of
course,
under
the
original
wagner
act,
the
term
“employee”
impliedly
excluded
independent
contractors.
the
problem
under
the
old
act,
the
problem
under
the
new
act,
has
always
been
where
the
draw
of
the
line
between
the
employer
and
employee
and
an
independent
contractor.
what
the
test
is
to
govern
the
--
he
has
to
govern
the
drawing
of
that
line
and
this
application
of
that
test
to
specific
situations.
now,
in
the
hearst
case
which
was
decided
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
which
was
decided
by
the
1947
amendment,
this
court
rejected
their
contention
that
in
drawing
the
line
between
employees
and
an
independent
contractors,
technical
common
law
standards
would
apply
exclusively.
it
held
instead
that
employee
status
or
independent
contractor
status
was
to
be
determined
upon
the
basis
of
the
underlying
economic
realities
of
the
relationship
in
the
light
of
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute
and
their
effectuation.
congress
disapproved
of
this
ruling
and
in
1947,
it
expressly
excluded
in
order
to
carry
out
the
disapproval
of
the
hearst
decision
and
expressly
excluded
from
the
statute
of
independent
contractors
from
the
term
“employee
--
independent
contractors”.
and
in
the
legislative
history,
it
made
clear
its
intention
that
the
term
employee
or
independent
contractor
was
to
be
defined
on
the
basis
of
general
agency
principles.
now,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
should
--
the
status
of
those
news
boys?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
they
thought
that
--
their
criticism
of
this
court's
decision
was
that
it
left
to
the
board
pretty
much
at
large.
pretty
much
at
large
or
without
any
standard
at
all
to
determine
who
is
going
--
who
was
an
employee
and
who
was
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
it
would.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
indeed,
this
court
itself
in
hearst
did
not
say
that
those
news
boys
would
not
have
satisfied
agency
principles.
but
it
took
the
occasion
of
that
case
of
course,
to
deal
with
the
very
larger
problem
of
what
the
proper
test
would
be
under
the
statute.
now,
it
is
trite
for
me
to
say
that
under
the
--
that
these
agency
principles
that
are
to
govern
the
task
of
determining
who
is
an
employee
and
who
is
an
independent
contractor,
it
is
trite
for
me
to
say
that
they
don't
furnish
us
with
any
simple
formula
that's
going
to
solve
our
problem
in
a
very
easy
fashion.
under
those
principles,
it
seems
that
in
large
measure,
the
decision
turns
upon
the
scope
and
extent
of
control
that
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed,
their
control
which
he
exercises
or
that
control
which
he
may
exercise
over
the
performance
of
the
job
or
of
the
service.
now
i
think
it
is
common
ground
among
us
here
at
counsel
table
that
in
assessing
the
requisite
degree
of
con
--
of
this
kind
of
control
that
no
single
factor,
no
single
element
of
the
relationship
between
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed
or
fellow
who
is
performing
this
service
that
no
single
element
is
decisive
but
that
all
of
the
elements,
their
relationship
must
be
taken
into
account
and
it
is
the
total
situation
that
governs.
now,
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency
which
we
all
cite
incidentally
and
rely
on,
we
all
come
--
cite
pretty
much
the
same
thing
but
come
to
different
conclusions.
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency,
among
the
relevant
factors
which
it
lists,
which
are
significant
for
determining
that
kind
of
control
whether
it's
employee
status
or
independent
contractors,
it
lists
among
other
things
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
control
over
the
details
of
the
work
by
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
being
performed,
whether
the
person
who
is
performing
the
service
is
engaged
in
a
distinct
occupation
or
business
or
whether
the
work
that
he
is
doing
is
an
integral
part
of
the
daily
business,
operations
of
the
person
for
whom
he
is
performing
the
service.
the
continuity
of
the
duration
of
the
relationship
between
the
person
for
whom
the
service
is
performed,
fellows
performing
the
service,
the
method
of
compensation
and
i
believe
that
some
others
listed
there.
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
a
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
obviously
this
is
an
area
in
which
there
is
going
to
be
an
enormous
infinite
variety
of
factual
situation,
and
obviously
decision
as
to
status
is
going
to
call
for
discretion,
for
judgment
and
i
might
even
say
for
some
intuitive
judgment.
we
believe
that
the
board's
overall
appraisal
of
the
overall
situation
here
is
--
as
its
judgment
and
its
judgment
of
these
--
in
agents
--
that
these
debit
agents
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors
is
wholly
reasonable
and
within
the
framework
of
the
legal
test
of
this
agency
principles.
in
the
first
place,
these
agents
do
have
a
relatively
and
continuing
relationship
with
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
unilaterally
promulgates
the
terms
and
conditions
of
their
service.
three,
these
agents
make
no
investments
in
the
business
and
they
have
no
independent
business
establishment.
four,
they
have
no
prior
experience
or
training
is
--
as
it
is
required
in
order
to
have
one
of
these
jobs.
they
assume
no
risk
of
profit,
no
risk
of
loss,
nor
the
possibility
--
and
know
the
posibilty
of
profit
beyond
the
premiums
which
they
collect
upon
under
insurance.
their
work
obviously
is
an
integral
part
of
the
company's
business
of
selling
insurance
and
servicing
its
policyholders.
the
collection
of
premiums
which
constitutes
the
major
part
of
the
work
which
these
business
agents
performed
is
routine
and
clerical.
the
nature
of
the
company's
business,
the
supervision
which
that
business
--
which
the
assistant
managers
exercise
over
these
debit
agents,
they're
reporting
and
acquiring
--
a
kind
of
requirements
which
these
agents
must
follow
and
the
diligence
in
the
industry
which
these
agents
must
demonstrate
in
order
to
properly
service
their
debt,
all
these
combined
to
indicate
that
these
agents
have
very
little
leeway
in
the
exercise
of
any
real
discretion
or
any
real
freedom
of
action
in
their
performances
or
functions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is.
it's
a
--
there
are
--
in
the
early
days,
the
wagner
act,
a
number
of
insurance
companies
pressed
the
same
issue
before
the
board
that
these
people
were
not
employed
or
not
independent
contractors.
but
the
board
has
uniformly
held
that
these
debit
agents
throughout
the
industry
are
employees
and
the
industry
has
at
large
measure
acquiesced,
i
think
perhaps
united
is
the
only
holdout.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
that
the
board
has
had
but
there
are
other
types
of
agents
obviously
were
may
be
quite
different
from
these
debit
agents,
from
the
debit
--
from
these
debit
agents,
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
board
has
had
a
--
at
the
moment,
i
don't
recall.
it
may
well
have
had
insurance
policy,
people
selling
insurance
other
than
debt
--
in
debit
agents.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
you
did
but
they
involved
unit
questions.
we
had
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
cases,
oh,
cases
under
the
labor
board?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
those
were
here
couple
of
terms
ago
and
it
involved
questions
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit.
there
was
no
issue
there
as
to
whether
or
not
the
debit
agents
were
employees.
nobody
was
disputing
that
the
debit
agents
involved
in
those
cases
were
employees
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
those
cases
involved
debit
agents
of
insurance
companies.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
these
people
on
the
trade
are
called
debit
agents.
these
people
whose
service
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there's
been
no
case
before
this
board
--
under
the
labor
--
before
this
court.
under
the
labor
act
as
to
the
status
of
these
insurance
agents
other
than
this
one
here
your
honor.
the
--
now,
to
be
sure,
these
agents
in
the
sense
are
on
their
own.
they
do
work
primarily
away
from
the
company's
district
office
and
apart
from
reporting
weekly
to
their
regional
office,
except
on
rare
occasions,
they
do
--
they
may
fix
their
own
hours
of
work
and
their
workdays.
but
we
submit
that
the
board
could
recently
discount
the
seeming
elements
of
independence
in
the
context
of
the
entire
picture
which
i
submit.
the
board
properly
found,
reflects
a
pervasive
control
and
supervision
over
every
aspect
of
the
agent's
functions
and
performance.
now,
the
company
argues
that
the
board
in
this
case
and
another
cases
that
its
judgment
in
this
case
and
other
case
at
bottom
rest
upon
a
continuing
adherence
to
the
hearst
case.
i
submitted
that
that
argument
is
ill-found.
of
course,
in
the
nature
of
the
problem,
in
the
nature
of
the
problem,
they
are
bound
to
be
common
factors
which
will
play
a
role
under
both
tests.
the
agency
principle
test
and
the
hearst
test
in
the
gray
area,
and
so
many
this
gray
area,
where's
going
to
be
a
difference
but
the
two
tests
may
make
a
difference,
in
the
gray
area
where
one
test
or
the
other
may
dictate
a
different
result.
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
distinction
between
the
two
tests,
the
economic
reality,
so
called
economic
reality
test
of
hearst,
and
the
agency
principles
does
not,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
said
in
another
context
does
not
present
a
glaringly
bright
line.
but
under
both
test,
you
do
take
into
account
all
of
the
elements
of
the
service
relationship.
the
differences
between
the
two
tests
that
under
hearst
in
the
closed
case
and
i
repeat
again
that
that's
the
only
area
where
these
two
tests
may
make
a
difference.
“that
in
the
close
case
which
may
fall
short
under
its
--
under
agency
principles
of
establishing
an
employee
status
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
under
the
hearst
test,
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
effectuation
of
those
policies
will
suffice
to
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
finding
that
that
person
is
an
employee.
now,
the
board
has
repeatedly
acknowledged
since
1947
that
agency
principles
do
in
fact
govern
its
determination
of
employee's
status
and
i
have
sought
to
explain,
i
believe
that
this
decision
in
this
case
does
come
forth
with
those
--
or
with
the
--
those
principles.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
thrust
of
the
company's
argument
on
this
leg
of
the
case
is
that
the
board
has
given
undue
weight
to
certain
factors
which
are
indicative
of
employee's
status
and
discarded
those
which
the
company
says
--
it
says,
point
the
other
way.
but
obviously
we
are
in
an
area
whether
there
will
be
differences
of
judgment
as
to
how
much
weight
is
to
be
given
to
one
factor
as
against
another
in
arriving
at
a
balanced
judgment.
but
i
submit
that
the
board's
judgment
in
this
case
is
vulnerable
to
attack
only
if
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
the
overall
evaluation
that
it
is
made
is
unreasonable
and
not
within
the
general
framework
of
this
agency
principles.
i
want
to
come
to
the
second
leg
of
my
argument
here
and
that
is
--
deal
with
what
the
court
below
has
done.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
in
displacing
the
board's
judgment
of
this
case
as
the
status
of
these
debit
agents
has
misapplied
or
misconceived
these
agency
principles,
and
has
over-stepped
the
proper
bounds
of
its
reviewing
function.
the
court
below
implicitly,
if
not
expressly,
and
recognized
that
the
company
does
exercise
a
substantial
degree
of
supervision
and
control
over
these
debit
agents.
but
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
said
that
in
determining
statutes
you
look
to
the
total
situation.
the
court
below
completely
neutralized
these
elements
of
control
and
supervision
which
the
company
does
in
fact
exercise
and
which
the
court
below,
i
think,
they
in
fact
does
recognize.
it
completely
neutralized
those
because
they
are
inherent
in
its
business
operations.
the
court
says
that
since
business
necessity
may
require
some
of
these
controls,
some
of
the
supervisions
you
simply
neutralize.
the
board
should
not
give
any
weight
at
all
to
those
particular
factors.
and
then
having
said
that,
the
court
then
look
at
the
fact
that
these
employees
are
under
own
in
the
sense
that
they
work
away
from
their
district
office,
that
they
may
select
their
own
hours,
and
gave
that
fact
a
decisive
weight.
but
we
submit
your
honors,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
court
to
discount
elements
of
control
and
supervision
which
the
company
does
in
fact
exercise
simply
because
business
necessity
requires
such
control
and
supervision
or
because
they
may
be
inherent
in
the
operation
of
the
company's
business.
it
is
--
if
those
controls
do
exist,
yet
that
such
supervision
does
exist
as
would
indicate
employee
status,
then
it's
irrelevant
what
the
reason
or
the
source
for
those
controls
may
be.
they
do
remain
a
fact
of
life,
and
they
should
be
weighed
in
the
balance
in
order
to
determine
an
overall
evaluation
whether
or
not
these
people
are
or
not
employees.
finally,
the
--
your
honor,
i
see
there's
one
more
minute
left.
i
have
about
five
more
minutes
to
go.
shall
i
stop
at
this
point?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alright
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
inquired
about
some
insurance
salesman
cases
in
this
court
and
i
mentioned
that
we
had
had
one
metropolitan
life
insurance
case
not
too
long
ago
and
that
that
case
involves
question
of
unit.
through
some
somewhat
curious
lapse
of
memory,
mr.
justice
black,
i
forgot
to
mention
one
other
case.
i
say
curious
lapse
of
memory
because
i
argued
it
and
since
i've
lost
it,
that's
probably
why
i
don't
want
to
remember
it.
but
that
was
the
insurance
agent,
the
prudential
insurance
agent's
case
which
is
also
cited
--
both
these
cases
certainly
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
one
was
on
361
477
and
i'm
sure
mr.
justice
brennan
will
recall
that
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
--
in
the
first
case,
the
prudential
insurance
case
you
had
involved
there
some
debit
agents.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
employees.
they
had
engaged
in
some
intimate
and
work
staff.
but
there's
in
the
question
there
was
whether
those
intimate
work
staff
is
constituted
bad
faith
bargaining
on
the
part
of
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
so
assumed
but
i
don't
want
to
raise
the
issue.
have
the
issue
was
not
–-
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
in
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
case,
that
too
involved
debit
agents
and
there
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
unit
which
the
board
had
fund
was
inappropriate
collective
bargaining
unit.
in
that
case,
it
was
conceded
that
they
were
employees.
now,
in
the
remaining
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
my
final
part
of
my
discussion.
yesterday,
i
sought
to
explain
that
the
board's
judgment
that
these
debit
agents
are
employees
under
the
meaning
of
the
act
is
reasonable
and
wholly
within
the
framework
of
the
applicable
governing
test.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
in
displacing
the
board's
judgment
as
the
status
of
these
agents
has,
as
i
said
yesterday
not
only
misconceived
the
controlling
test
but
we
also
think
that
it
has
overstepped
the
bounds
of
judicial
review.
this
court
has
often
said
that
problems
of
definition
of
status
have
been
wisely
committed
by
congress
to
the
expert
agency
as
created
and
not
to
the
courts.
the
company
argues
that
since
the
controlling
test
here
is
a
common
law
test,
that
the
board
has
no
special
expertise
in
this
area
and
that
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
owes
the
board
no
particular
deference
in
applying
such
a
standard.
but
i
suggest
your
honors
that
the
question
involved,
the
problem
involved
is
not
simply
one
of
law
but
rather
the
application
of
a
statutory
term
to
a
variety,
an
infinite
variety
of
factual
situations.
and
in
that
area
--
in
that
area,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
board
for
administering
the
statute
is
singularly
appropriate
and
this
court
only
recently
said,
“universal
camera
is
not
an
invitation
to
disregard
that
primacy.”
indeed,
universal
camera
says
that
even
in
areas
where
the
board
does
not
possessed
any
special
competence
or
expertise
that
the
board's
choice
of
two
fairly
conflicting
views
is
to
be
respected
by
a
reviewing
court
even
though
the
reviewing
court,
upon
the
de
novo
consideration
of
the
matter
might
have
fairly
and
reasonably
come
out
with
the
adequate
way,
the
other
conclusion.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
yesterday
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
say
this.
the
principal
criticism
that
both
the
house
and
the
senate
had
with
respect
to
the
hearst
cases
as
i
see
it,
the
thrust
of
their
criticism
was
that
they
thought
that
this
court
here
had
pretty
much
left
the
board
at
large
in
determining
whether
or
not
individual
for
employees
and
for
the
contractors
without
any
definite
standard.
and
in
the
house
conference
report,
the
court
--
it
was
said
there,
conference
report,
speaking
of
hearst
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
think
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
sure
that
the
board
would
be
applying
agency
rules
--
agency
rules
in
determining
the
status.
but
the
fact
that
they
adopted
a
common
law
rule
doesn't
mean
that
in
the
application
of
that
rule
that
the
board
was
not
to
have
the
usual
area
of
discretion
of
judgment
that
it
ordinarily
has
in
the
application
of
statutory
terms
to
particular
specific
situations.
now,
the
--
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
universal
camera,
universal
camera
as
this
court
said,
is
an
invitation
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
disregard
that
premise
in
the
application
of
a
specific
statutory
term
to
specific
situations.
it's
very
much
the
same
in
the
case
of
a
supervisor
to
be
sure
that
the
supervisor
is
not
a
common
law
term
but
congress
in
the
act
has
defined
the
various
incidents
that
established
supervisory
status.
and
repeatedly,
the
courts
have
said
that
that's
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
board
to
apply
that
definition,
to
apply
that
definition
to
a
specific
situation.
and
incidentally,
i
might
mention
that
unlike
this
case
here,
the
seventh
circuit
itself
has
paid
that
kind
of
difference
to
the
board
and
the
application
of
the
terms
“supervisor”
to
a
specific
situation.
now,
to
say
the
board
has
no
special
competence
in
this
area,
i
think
merely
overlooks
what
the
board
does.
the
board
has
these
situations
almost
daily.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
the
boards,
volumes
dealing
with
the
employees'
status
within
the
independent
contractors'
status,
with
supervisors'
status,
all
kinds
of
shadings,
all
these
various
and
almost
infinite
different
situations.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
surely,
that
experience
makes
for
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
in
the
words
of
this
court
is
entirely
the
usual
difference
by
a
reviewing
court
to
the
board
expertise
in
applying
specific
statutory
provisions
to
specific
situations.
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
often
does
have
short
form
of
decision
at
that
time.
