justice
abe
fortas
have
you
had
some
cases
involving
insurance
agents
other
than
those
who
write
industrial
insurance?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
--
your
position
is
different
from
the
government's
position,
is
it
not,
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
action?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
looking
at
page
17,
footnote
17
of
the
board's
brief
and
which
is
just
an
elaboration
of
what
they
say
several
times
in
the
text
as
i've
recall
and
that
is
that
the
governing
standard
as
a
result
of
the
congressional
action
is
that
agency
principles
are
dispositive.
and
you
--
you
sir,
are
you
telling
me
that
that
is
not
the
government's
position
as
you
understand
it?
justice
abe
fortas
“dispositive”
means
“dispositive”,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
do
i
correctly
recall
that
there
are
two
other
cases
that
did
not
come
to
this
court
involving
the
same
company
in
which
the
debit
agents
were
held
to
be
--
held
not
to
be
subject
to
the
act?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
--
was
there
a
factual
difference
in
that
--
between
that
case
and
the
one
we
have
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari
as
i
recall.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
--
telling
us
now
is
that
in
your
submission,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
facts
between
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
about,
mr.
groner.
what
are
the
differences?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
records?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
the
agent
gets
the
same
commission
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
groner
referred
us
to
your
brief,
mr.
segal
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
15
of
your
brief,
you
quote
a
court
of
appeals
with
approval.
it
reads,
as
follows,
“while
due
regard
must
be
had
for
the
purposes
of
the
act”
--
we
find
it
on
the
bottom
of
page
15
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
was
at
very
bottom,
“while
do
you
regard
must
be
had
for
the
purposes
of
the
act,
nevertheless,
agency
principles
constitutes
the
controlling
test
in
distinguishing
between
employees
and
independent
contractors.”
and
then
in
the
next
sentence
you
say,
“hearst
clearly
demonstrates
us
to
be
the
correct
approach.”
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
understand
that.
is
that
what
you
are
saying
in
your
brief
that
phrase?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
are
construing
the
effect
of
the
congressional
action
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
to
say,
i
don't
know
what
the
importance
of
this
is
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
this
verbal
excursion
is
going
to
help
me
conclusively
but
you
do
say
while
do
you
regard,
must
be
have
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
agency
principles
constitute
the
controlling
test
and
that's
pretty
close
to
what
mr.
groner
was
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
segal
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
some
purposes
--
for
some
purposes,
these
debit
agents
are
in
law
agents
of
the
insurance
company,
aren't
they?
suppose
a
debit
agent
makes
a
material
misrepresentation
of
fact
in
selling
a
policy
to
somebody,
isn't
the
insurance
company
liable
for
that
ordinarily
or
generally?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
take
each
plain
agency
principle
if
there
is
such
thing
i
had
take
back,
take
agency
principles.
and
if
the
debit
agent
goes
around,
sells
an
insurance
policy
of
this
company
and
makes
a
material
misrepresentation
of
fact,
ordinarily
went
to
the
court
say
that
principle
of
respondeat
superior
applies
and
the
company
is
held
to
responsibility
for
the
agent's
misrepresentation.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
yes.
i
think
so.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
next
thing
is
the
debit
agents
have
no
power
whatever
to
modify
the
terms
so
to
speak,
the
terms
of
sale.
that
is
to
say
the
rights
are
given
to
them,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
policy
are
prescribed
by
the
company
so
that
if
in
the
act
of
some,
they
are
bound,
they
have
no
freedom
to
bury
the
terms,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
general
motors
would
like
being
bound
by
that
mr.
segal?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they've
found
an
uncomfortable
and
perhaps
dangerous.
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
--
whatever
the
cause
may
be?
whatever
the
cause
may
be,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
debit
agent
does
not
have
control
or
discretion
over
the
product
so
to
speak
or
the
terms
and
conditions
of
sale,
number
1.
and
number
2,
for
certain
purposes,
in
any
event
the
company
is
responsible
for
the
actions
and
the
representations
of
the
debit
agents.
those
are
the
two
points
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that.
and
the
problem
is
that,
there
are
one
of
these
cases,
i
expect
you
to
bring
despite
the
proposition
that
you
have
emphasized
which
is
an
ultimately
the
question
as
one
of
law.
the
legal
judgment
depends
upon,
as
mr.
justice
black
was
saying,
depends
upon
the
totality
of
the
facts
and
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
better?
justice
abe
fortas
the
board
found
that
no
prejudicial
error
is
committed
by
the
examiner.
that's
on
page
1200.
you
know,
mr.
segal,
whether
that
is
a
customary
form
that
the
board
uses
when
it
affirms
examiners'
findings?
justice
abe
fortas
then
that
they,
you
can
use
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
can
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
finds
that
no
prejudicial
error
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
this
was
a
prejudicial
error.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
had
some
cases

agents
