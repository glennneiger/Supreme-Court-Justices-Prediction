mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
parties
in
this
case
have
agreed
as
to
the
legal
test
to
be
applied
when
an
issue
arises
under
the
labor
relations
act
as
to
whether
particular
workers
or
employees
or
independent
contractors.
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
test,
two
aspects.
one
is
what
may
be
termed
the
general
agency
principle
or
the
common
law
principle.
and
i
think
that
the
parties
have
looked
primarily
to
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency
for
the
factors
which
are
involved
in
terms
of
their
test.
but
the
parties
are
agreed
that
that
test
is
not
the
entire
test.
there
is
a
second
test
which
the
company,
the
respondent,
joins
the
petitioners
in
making
relevant,
at
least
so
the
brief
says,
and
that
is,
that
there
must
be
consideration
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
a
realistic
application
of
the
common
law
test,
so
that
there
are
two
facets.
one
is
the
common
law
or
the
general
principles
of
law.
the
other
is
the
effectuation
of
the
principles
of
the
act
or
a
realistic
application
of
the
first.
now,
the
first
facets
was
added
by
--
was
made
express
as
a
result
of
the
congressional
action
or
reaction
to
the
hearst
case
of
this
court.
that
congressional
action,
we
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
can
be
summed
up
fairly
and
accurately
as
a
feeling
that
both
the
board
and
this
court
in
the
hearst
case
had
given
no
attention
whatsoever
to
common
law
principles.
congress
felt
that
the
board
had
not
paid
any
attention
to
those
principles.
congress
read
the
opinion
of
this
court
as
expressly
saying
that
common
law
or
general
principles
of
agency
law
are
not
to
be
considered
but
only
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
only
the
expertise
of
the
board.
now,
whether
that
reading
was
right
or
wrong
is
beside
the
point.
what
we
submit
and
submit
most
emphatically
is
that
the
congressional
record,
the
reports
of
the
committees
make
very
clear
that
this
was
the
congressional
reading
so
that
the
difference
that
the
congressional
reaction
made
was
that
the
common
law
test
had
to
be
considered
and
we
further
submit
that
this
is
the
only
difference
that
the
congressional
reaction
to
the
hearst
test
makes.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
but
congress
was
agreeing
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
primary
thrust
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
congress
disagreed
with
the
result?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
then
i
would
submit
to,
your
honors,
that
you
would
look
to
the
standard
as
defined
by
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history.
the
way
that
congress
reached
that
result
was
that
it
believed
the
news
voice
to
be
independent
merchants.
this
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
house
report
“independent
merchants”.
and
the
congress
stated,
well,
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
in
general,
the
concept
of
an
“employee”
is
one
who
makes
his
living
as
part
of
someone
else's
organization
through
a
wage
or
a
salary
whereas
an
“independent
contractor”
is
one
who
makes
his
living
by
profit,
by
the
difference
between
the
costs
of
the
goods
that
he
purchases
and
his
selling
price.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
mr.
manoli
stated
that
the
common
law
test
had
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
board.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
that
is
the
government's
position
as
i
do
understand
that,
excuse
me.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed.
but
agency
--
the
principles
of
agency
law
has
to
be
examined
realistically.
the
two
facets
of
the
test
which
i
was
emphasizing
are
not
inconsistent.
they
are
compatible.
i
merely
separated
them
for
purposes
of
emphasis.
what
the
board
is
emphasizing
is
what
we
are
not
emphasizing.
that
in
the
application
of
the
agency
tests,
there
must
be
some
room
for
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there
must
be
some
room
for
a
realistic
application
and
respondent
joins
us
in
this.
if
you
will
look
at
pages
13
and
15,
and
18
of
his
brief,
you
will
find
that
they
also
emphasized
that
they
are
not
arguing
that
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
be
disregarded.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
does
--
yes,
there
are
factual
circumstances
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
that
include
almost
any
pertinent
fact
in
determining
whether
a
group
--
a
particular
group
of
workers
are
employees
or
independent
contractors.
the
reinstatement
list
as
i
recall
about
ten
separate
clusters
of
fact
which
are
pertinent.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
that
--
it's
because
of
that,
mr.
justice,
black
because
the
application
of
the
common
law
rule,
if
it
is
viewed
in
isolation
as
some
kind
of
automatic
touch
stone
for
defining
rock
which
will
give
the
answer
which
may
lead
to
error
and
will
lead
to
a
diversity
of
results.
but
if
it
is
illuminated
by
--
in
terms
of
the
labor
relations
act,
if
it
is
illuminated
by
regard
for
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
our
regard
for
a
realistic
application.
then,
we
would
submit
that
the
board
in
that
context
has
an
expertise
which
the
court
should
respect
and
which
the
normal
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
one
here
is
arguing
that
but
the
decision
of
the
court
below
reflects
that.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
provides
no
realistic
basis
for
saying
that
they
gave
regard
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
precisely
the
way
that
i
would
read
it,
mr.
justice
black
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
would
say
that
on
analysis
they
did
not
give
any
consideration,
any
realistic
or
informed
consideration
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
or
to
the
fact
that
this
problem
arose
in
the
context
of
an
issue
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
is
precisely
because
the
court
below
regarded
the
common
law
test
as
some
abstraction
which
could
guide
them
infallibly
without
regard
to
the
context
that
the
decision
below
will
lead
to
a
very
wide
error
if
it
is
not
reversed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
common
law
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
correct,
that
it
--
the
original
question
which
gave
rise
to
the
concept
of
independent
contractor
was
whether
there
was
liability
in
tort
when
a
third
party
who
had
been
engaged
by
the
defendant
to
do
some
work
committed
a
tort
against
the
plaintiff.
and
the
original
common
law
test
was
a
test
of
independent
calling.
this
was
the
basis
for
the
so-called
“rider
patrol
test”.
the
common
law
decisions
held
that
if
that
third
party
were
engaged
in
an
independent
calling
such
as
draymen
or
minor
or
what
you
will.
if
he
was
truly
independent,
then
the
person
who
had
engaged
in
these
services
should
not
be
held
liable
for
the
tort.
and
that
independent
calling
test,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
evokes
the
independent
merchant
phraseology
which
the
congress
used
so
that
the
background
in
tort
was
a
background
of
looking
to
the
cause
for
the
lack
of
control.
and
the
original
cause
was
that
the
party
was
engaging
in
a
different
calling
or
enterprise.
it
was
a
different
economic
or
legal
business
entity.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
did
not
limit
itself
to
precise
definition.
no,
your
honor.
and
that
is
why
the
context
makes
a
difference
and
that
is
why
i
assume
that
respondent
joins
us
in
pointing
out
that
the
context
makes
a
difference.
and
that
the
context
in
this
case
is
in
the
labor
relations
act,
so
that
we
would
apply
that
if
we
apply
the
test
that
congress
specify
in
the
legislative
history
ought
to
have
been
specified
in
the
hearst
case,
that
test
will
result
in
this
case
in
the
finding
of
employees
because
these
insurance
agents
are
not
independent
merchants.
they
do
not
make
their
living
by
profit.
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
respondents'
entire
organization.
they
are
not
separate
business
entities.
they
do
not
have
their
own
place
of
business.
they
do
not
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public
as
being
a
separate
and
distinct
business
entity.
and
so,
whatever
test
is
applied
and
there
are
obviously
many
different
verbal
formulations,
whatever
test
is
applied,
whatever
standard
of
judicial
review
is
applied,
the
decision
below
cannot
be
sustained.
the
decision
below
sweeps
to
one
side
many
of
the
evidences
of
factual
control,
which
are
contained
on
this
record
with
the
statement
that
they
are
inherent
in
the
insurance
business
or
in
the
debit
life
and
accident
and
fire
insurance
business.
now,
whether
or
not
they
are
inherent
in
the
business,
we
would
submit
it's
beside
the
legal
point
of
the
right
of
control
tests
realistically
or
unrealistically
applied
because
the
right
of
control
looks
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
controls
may
be
exercised.
the
right
of
control
is
a
right
of
controlled
tests.
if
the
right
to
control
has
been
reserved
even
though
it
has
not
been
exercised,
that,
according
to
the
traditional
formulation
is
enough
so
that
those
involved
must
be
classified
as
employees.
and
to
say
that
it
is
necessary
in
the
nature
of
the
industry
because
a
debit
insurance
agent
is
given
a
collection
book
with
a
group
of
life
and
health
and
fire
policy
holders
from
whom
he
collects,
so
that
he
must
perforce
make
many
reports
and
must
report
to
the
office
on
a
weekly
basis
because
these
are
necessary
in
the
industry.
that
is
obviously
no
reason
to
disregard
the
fact
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
is
a
compelling
reason
for
saying
that
on
this
record
in
this
industry,
demonstration
has
been
made,
that
control
has
been
reserved
and
that
in
fact
control
has
been
exercised.
the
court
made
much
--
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
concept
that
these
agents
were
on
their
own.
i
must
confess
i
do
not
know
what
that
means.
i
suspect
that
again
it
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
the
court
below
concluded
that
they
were
independent
contractors.
if
the
court
meant
that
they
were
on
their
own
in
the
sense
that
they
were
on
their
own
business
enterprises,
that
is
clear
error.
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
support
it.
if
the
court
below
meant
that
they
were
“on
their
own”
in
a
physical
sense
because
it
is
true
that
most
of
their
working
time
they
spend
out
and
the
debit,
their
concentrated
territory
where
most
of
their
policyholder's
reside.
if
that
is
what
the
court
meant,
again,
that
is
not
relevant
legally
and
not
supported
on
the
record
factually.
it
is
not
relevant
legally
because
the
right
of
control
may
be
reserved.
the
right
of
physical
control
may
be
reserved
even
though
it
is
not
exercised.
and
indeed,
it
is
wrong
factually
because
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
right
of
physical
control
has
indeed
been
reserved
and
it
is
being
exercised
on
at
least
two
different
ways,
one
is
that
there
is
a
regular
meeting
which
all
these
agents
must
attend
on
a
thursday
or
friday
morning;
they
must
be
there,
they
are
there
and
this
is
an
occasion
when
supervision
is
physical
felt,
when
management
may
physically
confer
with
the
agents
and
for
example,
tell
him
that
he
is
not
doing
a
satisfactory
job
and
therefore
must
resign
or
should
look
for
other
employment.
furthermore,
there
is
physical
presence
felt
by
the
accompaniment
on
the
debit
of
the
agent
as
he
makes
his
collections
and
sales
rounds.
there
is
a
hierarchy
above
the
agents,
assistant
managers,
special
riders,
managers
and
then
all
the
way
up
to
vice
president
of
sales.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
have
been
three
decisions
but
basically
there's
only
one
other
case.
the
two
that
--
the
first
decision
did
not
reach
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
previous
case.
the
first
decision
on
the
seventh
circuit
turned
on
a
due
process
point.
it
was
a
remanding
for
further
hearing.
after
that
further
hearing,
the
case
did
go
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
involved
a
pennsylvania
unit,
as
i
recall
it
was
1960,
304
f.2d
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
hold
and
that
is
the
only
decision
prior
to
the
case
now
under
review
that
they
were
independent
contractors.
they
both
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
the
--
the
primary
without
me
to
be
facetious,
your
honor,
the
primary
factual
difference
is
that
we
are
here.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
at
that
point,
the
union
had
no
right
to
take
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
petition.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari.
the
union
had
no
legal
right
so
far
as
we
know
the
file
what
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--
the
board
did
not.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
no.
let
me
answer.
secondly,
there
are
differences
in
facts,
yes.
they
are
differences
in
facts
can
be
described
it
seems
to
me
on
two
different
levels.
first
of
all,
the
record
is
different.
in
other
words,
the
particular
witnesses
who
testified
here
and
what
they
testified
to
is
different.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
--
let
me
make
clear.
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
initial
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
so
that
if
i
was
saying
that
i'm
relying
on
the
differences,
that
would
not
be
an
accurate
and
fair
statement.
it
is
clear
on
this
record
than
perhaps
it
was
on
the
last
that
these
agents
are
required
to
come
weekly
to
the
office.
it
is
clearer
on
this
record
than
perhaps
it
was
on
the
last
that
they
do
not
invest
any
of
their
own
money;
that
they
make
no
investment
whatsoever
with
respect
to
becoming
agents
or
staying
agents
with
the
exception
of
$5.00
or
$10.00
for
the
initial
state
license.
the
renewals
are
paid
for
by
the
company.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
that
it
was
on
the
last
that
these
agents
are
not
separate
independent
business
entities
but
that
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
entire
structure
and
hierarchy
of
the
respondent.
so
that,
for
example,
when
they
are
absent
for
illness
or
for
the
so-called
“service
bonus”,
which
is
in
reality
a
vacation
plan,
their
assistant
manager
covers
the
debit
and
the
sales
that
he
makes
in
general
accrual
to
the
agents'
advantage.
it
is
perhaps
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
than
it
was
on
the
last
that
the
method
and
amount
and
type
of
compensation
is
dictated
unilaterally
by
the
company
that
the
contract
which
the
agent
signed
has
been
written
solely
by
the
company
without
any
negotiation
or
consultation
with
the
agents.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
that
that
it
was
on
the
last
that
the
company
retains
and
indeed
has
exercised
the
right
to
hire
and
fire
these
agents.
those
are
perhaps
the
principle
elements
on
which
this
record
is
clearer.
we
believe
that
the
prior
record
was
that
the
case
for
the
general
counsel
had
more
witnesses
in
this
particular
hearing.
they
were,
we
think,
more
persuasive
and
then
thorough
witnesses.
in
short,
the
documentary
evidence
is
more
ample
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
control
retained
in
the
fact.
for
example,
the
transfers
of
cases
may
not
be
made
without
the
approval
of
the
company.
there
is,
for
example,
in
this
record
enumeration
of
two
or
three
cases
where
the
approval
was
not
given;
thereby
giving
a
clearer
proof
that
the
right
had
--
the
right
of
control
in
this
respect
had
been
retained.
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
down
through
the
various
elements.
we
believe
that
the
facts
are
much
clearer
on
this.
the
bargaining
unit
involved
in
this
case
is
a
different
one.
this
case
involves
anne
arundel
county
in
baltimore.
the
other
case
involves
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
and
there
are
other
certain
differences
on
the
facts;
some
of
the
agents
in
this
case
came
from
the
quaker
city
life
insurance
company
and
that
made
some
difference
in
the
record
so
that
there
are
some
differences
with
respect
to
the
two
records.
that
if
--
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
should
like
to
save
the
balance
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
to
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
the
first
answer
i
will
give
your
honor,
is
that
the
board
expressly
disavowed
any
reliance
on
the
off
the
stand
demeanor
testimony.
so
that
what
was
before
the
court
was
the
board
order?
so
that
even
though
the
board
had
adopted
the
short
form
order,
which
in
effect
adopted
the
findings
and
decision
of
the
trial
examiner,
they
dropped
the
footnote,
indeed,
from
the
record
to
form
to
call
special
attention
to
it
and
to
say
we
disavow
any
reliance
upon
the
comment
by
the
trial
examiner
with
respect
to
off
stand
demeanor.
that
is
my
first
answer.
my
second
answer
is
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
trial
examiner's
decision
will
demonstrate
that
this
is
pure
dictum,
that
he
said
it
was
pure
dictum
and
that
the
entire
elevation
of
this
issue
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
respondent
is
merely,
and
i
regret
to
say
it
but
it
is
our
view
that
it
is
merely
one
way
of
attempting
to
mask
the
overwhelming
facts
of
this
record
demonstrating
that
these
agents
are
employees.
the
trial
examiner's
decision
is
a
long
and
a
careful
one.
if
you
open
it
to
any
page,
it
relies
as
much
upon
witnesses
called
by
the
respondent,
vice
president
ross,
division
manager
forwaldt,
the
agents
from
st.
paul
street.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
the
examiner
found
that
all
the
testimony
called
by
the
respondent
was
false.
if
you
read
the
examiner's
decision,
you
will
find
that
he
weighed
all
the
evidence
and
that
he
doesn't
give
--
he
does
indeed
give
credence
to
many
of
the
statements
by
the
respondent's
witnesses.
many
of
the
facts
which
mr.
segal
has
said
it
have
admittedly
so
and
did
are
not
admittedly
so.
for
example,
on
page
222
of
the
record,
the
question
is,
“do
you
think
it
is
against
the
rules
for
you
to
get
someone
to
collect
for
you?”
answer,
“if
i
may
you
asked
me,
if
i
thought
it
was
against
the
rules
to
have
an
outsider
and
that's
the
term
you
used,
do
my
work
for
me
and
i
said
yes
and
i
still
say
yes
that
i
consider
it
a
violation
of
the
rules.”
now,
mr.
segal
said
admittedly
there
were
no
individual
meetings.
on
page
632
of
the
record,
the
question
is,
“was
mr.
gore
asked
to
come
in
on
a
day
other
than
his
regular
reporting
day?”
the
witness,
respondent's
witness,
william
h.
forwaldt
answer,
“yes,
he
was”,
page
632
of
the
record.
mr.
segal
states
that
the
headquarters
of
these
agents
are
in
the
home.
if
you
look
them
up
in
the
phonebook,
you
would
find
the
address
and
the
telephone
number
of
that
district
office
of
the
company.
these
employees
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
hierarchy
and
organization
of
the
respondent.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed,
that's
on
the
record.
they
have
no
employees
of
their
own.
the
products
which
they
sell
are
the
respondent's
products.
the
headquarters
which
they
use
is
the
respondent's
headquarters.
the
very
purpose
of
the
district
office
testified
to
by
witnesses
called
by
the
respondent.
the
very
purpose
of
the
district
office
is
because
the
respondent
has
decided
that
that
is
the
best
manner
on
means
it
has
selected
for
carrying
on
its
business.
so
that
the
business
we
are
dealing
with
as
the
organization
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
business
and
organization
of
the
respondents.
these
employees
rely
upon
this
employment,
mr.
justice
harlan,
for
their
livelihood.
whatever
they
may
do
by
way
of
advocation
as
the
salaries
of
$7,000
to
$20,000
demonstrate
and
as
the
record
demonstrates,
many
times,
these
are
full
time
employees.
they
have
no
genuine
bargaining
power
vis-à-vis
the
respondent.
the
company
pays
social
security
tax
payments
which
they
would
not
do
in
terms
of
statutory
provision
that
they
must
be
full
time
insurance
agents
if
the
contribution
is
to
be
made.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
the
company
makes
the
social
security
payments.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
act
does
not
to
it
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
but
if
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
--
there
is
a
provision
which
specifically
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
agents
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
there
are
various
other
requirements
such
as
that
most
of
the
services
must
be
performed
personally
which
is
effective
response
to
the
statement
that
they
may
hire
others,
if
they
do
hire
others
and
they
are
not
performing
the
services
personally.
so
in
response
to
the
particular
part
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
agents
and
provides
various
conditions
they're
not
effective
which,
mr.
justice
black,
is
indeed
that
the
implication
in
that
effect
is
that
these
agents
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors
that
the
board
was
correct
in
within
its
statutory
finding,
authority
and
finding
them
to
be
employees,
that
the
court
exceeded
any
test
of
law
or
a
fact
of
law.
any
proper
test
of
review,
any
proper
test
of
agency,
any
proper
test
of
law
in
deciding
that
they
were
not
on
the
basis,
we
submit,
of
the
court's
own
approach
to
this
problem.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
no.
i'm
relying
particularly
on
the
section
of
the
act
which
expressly
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
salesmen,
i
believe.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
not
necessarily.
no.
i'm
merely
calling
attention
to
the
particular
elements
that
the
statute
requires.
full
time
is
one
of
them.
performing
the
services
personally
is
another.
not
making
substantial
investment
is
another
but
the
terms
“employee”
and
“independent
contractor”
are
not
relevant
to
the
particular
payments
on
behalf
of
full
time
life
insurance
agents.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
these
agents
are
under
a
debit
plan
--
excuse
me,
under
a
pension
plan
which
is
in
effect
a
profit
sharing
plan.
the
definition
of
this
plan
applies
to
employees,
the
definition
of
employees
as
drafted
by
the
company
covers
specifically
the
debit
agents.
so
that
there
is
no
concession
by
the
company
that
the
application
of
the
pension
plan
to
the
employees
has
an
--
or
the
word
“employees”
in
that
context
is
applicable
here.
but
yes,
they
do
have
a
pension
plan
and
they
are
covered
by
the
same
pension
plan
and
as
all
other
admitted
employees
of
respondent
are
covered
by.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
parties
in
this
case
have
agreed
as
to
the
legal
test
to
be
applied
when
an
issue
arises
under
the
labor
relations
act
as
to
whether
particular
workers
or
employees
or
independent
contractors.
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
test,
two
aspects.
one
is
what
may
be
termed
the
general
agency
principle
or
the
common
law
principle.
and
i
think
that
the
parties
have
looked
primarily
to
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency
for
the
factors
which
are
involved
in
terms
of
their
test.
but
the
parties
are
agreed
that
that
test
is
not
the
entire
test.
there
is
a
second
test
which
the
company,
the
respondent,
joins
the
petitioners
in
making
relevant,
at
least
so
the
brief
says,
and
that
is,
that
there
must
be
consideration
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
a
realistic
application
of
the
common
law
test,
so
that
there
are
two
facets.
one
is
the
common
law
or
the
general
principles
of
law.
the
other
is
the
effectuation
of
the
principles
of
the
act
or
a
realistic
application
of
the
first.
now,
the
first
facets
was
added
by
--
was
made
express
as
a
result
of
the
congressional
action
or
reaction
to
the
hearst
case
of
this
court.
that
congressional
action,
we
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
can
be
summed
up
fairly
and
accurately
as
a
feeling
that
both
the
board
and
this
court
in
the
hearst
case
had
given
no
attention
whatsoever
to
common
law
principles.
congress
felt
that
the
board
had
not
paid
any
attention
to
those
principles.
congress
read
the
opinion
of
this
court
as
expressly
saying
that
common
law
or
general
principles
of
agency
law
are
not
to
be
considered
but
only
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
only
the
expertise
of
the
board.
now,
whether
that
reading
was
right
or
wrong
is
beside
the
point.
what
we
submit
and
submit
most
emphatically
is
that
the
congressional
record,
the
reports
of
the
committees
make
very
clear
that
this
was
the
congressional
reading
so
that
the
difference
that
the
congressional
reaction
made
was
that
the
common
law
test
had
to
be
considered
and
we
further
submit
that
this
is
the
only
difference
that
the
congressional
reaction
to
the
hearst
test
makes.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
but
congress
was
agreeing
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
primary
thrust
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
congress
disagreed
with
the
result?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
then
i
would
submit
to,
your
honors,
that
you
would
look
to
the
standard
as
defined
by
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history.
the
way
that
congress
reached
that
result
was
that
it
believed
the
news
voice
to
be
independent
merchants.
this
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
house
report
“independent
merchants”.
and
the
congress
stated,
well,
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
in
general,
the
concept
of
an
“employee”
is
one
who
makes
his
living
as
part
of
someone
else's
organization
through
a
wage
or
a
salary
whereas
an
“independent
contractor”
is
one
who
makes
his
living
by
profit,
by
the
difference
between
the
costs
of
the
goods
that
he
purchases
and
his
selling
price.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
mr.
manoli
stated
that
the
common
law
test
had
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
board.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
that
is
the
government's
position
as
i
do
understand
that,
excuse
me.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed.
but
agency
--
the
principles
of
agency
law
has
to
be
examined
realistically.
the
two
facets
of
the
test
which
i
was
emphasizing
are
not
inconsistent.
they
are
compatible.
i
merely
separated
them
for
purposes
of
emphasis.
what
the
board
is
emphasizing
is
what
we
are
not
emphasizing.
that
in
the
application
of
the
agency
tests,
there
must
be
some
room
for
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there
must
be
some
room
for
a
realistic
application
and
respondent
joins
us
in
this.
if
you
will
look
at
pages
13
and
15,
and
18
of
his
brief,
you
will
find
that
they
also
emphasized
that
they
are
not
arguing
that
the
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
be
disregarded.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
does
--
yes,
there
are
factual
circumstances
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
that
include
almost
any
pertinent
fact
in
determining
whether
a
group
--
a
particular
group
of
workers
are
employees
or
independent
contractors.
the
reinstatement
list
as
i
recall
about
ten
separate
clusters
of
fact
which
are
pertinent.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
that
--
it's
because
of
that,
mr.
justice,
black
because
the
application
of
the
common
law
rule,
if
it
is
viewed
in
isolation
as
some
kind
of
automatic
touch
stone
for
defining
rock
which
will
give
the
answer
which
may
lead
to
error
and
will
lead
to
a
diversity
of
results.
but
if
it
is
illuminated
by
--
in
terms
of
the
labor
relations
act,
if
it
is
illuminated
by
regard
for
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
our
regard
for
a
realistic
application.
then,
we
would
submit
that
the
board
in
that
context
has
an
expertise
which
the
court
should
respect
and
which
the
normal
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
one
here
is
arguing
that
but
the
decision
of
the
court
below
reflects
that.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
provides
no
realistic
basis
for
saying
that
they
gave
regard
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
precisely
the
way
that
i
would
read
it,
mr.
justice
black
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
would
say
that
on
analysis
they
did
not
give
any
consideration,
any
realistic
or
informed
consideration
to
effectuation
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
or
to
the
fact
that
this
problem
arose
in
the
context
of
an
issue
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
is
precisely
because
the
court
below
regarded
the
common
law
test
as
some
abstraction
which
could
guide
them
infallibly
without
regard
to
the
context
that
the
decision
below
will
lead
to
a
very
wide
error
if
it
is
not
reversed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
common
law
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
correct,
that
it
--
the
original
question
which
gave
rise
to
the
concept
of
independent
contractor
was
whether
there
was
liability
in
tort
when
a
third
party
who
had
been
engaged
by
the
defendant
to
do
some
work
committed
a
tort
against
the
plaintiff.
and
the
original
common
law
test
was
a
test
of
independent
calling.
this
was
the
basis
for
the
so-called
“rider
patrol
test”.
the
common
law
decisions
held
that
if
that
third
party
were
engaged
in
an
independent
calling
such
as
draymen
or
minor
or
what
you
will.
if
he
was
truly
independent,
then
the
person
who
had
engaged
in
these
services
should
not
be
held
liable
for
the
tort.
and
that
independent
calling
test,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
evokes
the
independent
merchant
phraseology
which
the
congress
used
so
that
the
background
in
tort
was
a
background
of
looking
to
the
cause
for
the
lack
of
control.
and
the
original
cause
was
that
the
party
was
engaging
in
a
different
calling
or
enterprise.
it
was
a
different
economic
or
legal
business
entity.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
did
not
limit
itself
to
precise
definition.
no,
your
honor.
and
that
is
why
the
context
makes
a
difference
and
that
is
why
i
assume
that
respondent
joins
us
in
pointing
out
that
the
context
makes
a
difference.
and
that
the
context
in
this
case
is
in
the
labor
relations
act,
so
that
we
would
apply
that
if
we
apply
the
test
that
congress
specify
in
the
legislative
history
ought
to
have
been
specified
in
the
hearst
case,
that
test
will
result
in
this
case
in
the
finding
of
employees
because
these
insurance
agents
are
not
independent
merchants.
they
do
not
make
their
living
by
profit.
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
respondents'
entire
organization.
they
are
not
separate
business
entities.
they
do
not
have
their
own
place
of
business.
they
do
not
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public
as
being
a
separate
and
distinct
business
entity.
and
so,
whatever
test
is
applied
and
there
are
obviously
many
different
verbal
formulations,
whatever
test
is
applied,
whatever
standard
of
judicial
review
is
applied,
the
decision
below
cannot
be
sustained.
the
decision
below
sweeps
to
one
side
many
of
the
evidences
of
factual
control,
which
are
contained
on
this
record
with
the
statement
that
they
are
inherent
in
the
insurance
business
or
in
the
debit
life
and
accident
and
fire
insurance
business.
now,
whether
or
not
they
are
inherent
in
the
business,
we
would
submit
it's
beside
the
legal
point
of
the
right
of
control
tests
realistically
or
unrealistically
applied
because
the
right
of
control
looks
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
controls
may
be
exercised.
the
right
of
control
is
a
right
of
controlled
tests.
if
the
right
to
control
has
been
reserved
even
though
it
has
not
been
exercised,
that,
according
to
the
traditional
formulation
is
enough
so
that
those
involved
must
be
classified
as
employees.
and
to
say
that
it
is
necessary
in
the
nature
of
the
industry
because
a
debit
insurance
agent
is
given
a
collection
book
with
a
group
of
life
and
health
and
fire
policy
holders
from
whom
he
collects,
so
that
he
must
perforce
make
many
reports
and
must
report
to
the
office
on
a
weekly
basis
because
these
are
necessary
in
the
industry.
that
is
obviously
no
reason
to
disregard
the
fact
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
is
a
compelling
reason
for
saying
that
on
this
record
in
this
industry,
demonstration
has
been
made,
that
control
has
been
reserved
and
that
in
fact
control
has
been
exercised.
the
court
made
much
--
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
concept
that
these
agents
were
on
their
own.
i
must
confess
i
do
not
know
what
that
means.
i
suspect
that
again
it
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
the
court
below
concluded
that
they
were
independent
contractors.
if
the
court
meant
that
they
were
on
their
own
in
the
sense
that
they
were
on
their
own
business
enterprises,
that
is
clear
error.
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
support
it.
if
the
court
below
meant
that
they
were
“on
their
own”
in
a
physical
sense
because
it
is
true
that
most
of
their
working
time
they
spend
out
and
the
debit,
their
concentrated
territory
where
most
of
their
policyholder's
reside.
if
that
is
what
the
court
meant,
again,
that
is
not
relevant
legally
and
not
supported
on
the
record
factually.
it
is
not
relevant
legally
because
the
right
of
control
may
be
reserved.
the
right
of
physical
control
may
be
reserved
even
though
it
is
not
exercised.
and
indeed,
it
is
wrong
factually
because
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
right
of
physical
control
has
indeed
been
reserved
and
it
is
being
exercised
on
at
least
two
different
ways,
one
is
that
there
is
a
regular
meeting
which
all
these
agents
must
attend
on
a
thursday
or
friday
morning;
they
must
be
there,
they
are
there
and
this
is
an
occasion
when
supervision
is
physical
felt,
when
management
may
physically
confer
with
the
agents
and
for
example,
tell
him
that
he
is
not
doing
a
satisfactory
job
and
therefore
must
resign
or
should
look
for
other
employment.
furthermore,
there
is
physical
presence
felt
by
the
accompaniment
on
the
debit
of
the
agent
as
he
makes
his
collections
and
sales
rounds.
there
is
a
hierarchy
above
the
agents,
assistant
managers,
special
riders,
managers
and
then
all
the
way
up
to
vice
president
of
sales.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
have
been
three
decisions
but
basically
there's
only
one
other
case.
the
two
that
--
the
first
decision
did
not
reach
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
previous
case.
the
first
decision
on
the
seventh
circuit
turned
on
a
due
process
point.
it
was
a
remanding
for
further
hearing.
after
that
further
hearing,
the
case
did
go
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
involved
a
pennsylvania
unit,
as
i
recall
it
was
1960,
304
f.2d
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
hold
and
that
is
the
only
decision
prior
to
the
case
now
under
review
that
they
were
independent
contractors.
they
both
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
the
--
the
primary
without
me
to
be
facetious,
your
honor,
the
primary
factual
difference
is
that
we
are
here.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
at
that
point,
the
union
had
no
right
to
take
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
petition.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari.
the
union
had
no
legal
right
so
far
as
we
know
the
file
what
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--
the
board
did
not.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
no.
let
me
answer.
secondly,
there
are
differences
in
facts,
yes.
they
are
differences
in
facts
can
be
described
it
seems
to
me
on
two
different
levels.
first
of
all,
the
record
is
different.
in
other
words,
the
particular
witnesses
who
testified
here
and
what
they
testified
to
is
different.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
--
let
me
make
clear.
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
initial
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
so
that
if
i
was
saying
that
i'm
relying
on
the
differences,
that
would
not
be
an
accurate
and
fair
statement.
it
is
clear
on
this
record
than
perhaps
it
was
on
the
last
that
these
agents
are
required
to
come
weekly
to
the
office.
it
is
clearer
on
this
record
than
perhaps
it
was
on
the
last
that
they
do
not
invest
any
of
their
own
money;
that
they
make
no
investment
whatsoever
with
respect
to
becoming
agents
or
staying
agents
with
the
exception
of
$5.00
or
$10.00
for
the
initial
state
license.
the
renewals
are
paid
for
by
the
company.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
that
it
was
on
the
last
that
these
agents
are
not
separate
independent
business
entities
but
that
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
entire
structure
and
hierarchy
of
the
respondent.
so
that,
for
example,
when
they
are
absent
for
illness
or
for
the
so-called
“service
bonus”,
which
is
in
reality
a
vacation
plan,
their
assistant
manager
covers
the
debit
and
the
sales
that
he
makes
in
general
accrual
to
the
agents'
advantage.
it
is
perhaps
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
than
it
was
on
the
last
that
the
method
and
amount
and
type
of
compensation
is
dictated
unilaterally
by
the
company
that
the
contract
which
the
agent
signed
has
been
written
solely
by
the
company
without
any
negotiation
or
consultation
with
the
agents.
it
is
perhaps
clearer
on
this
record
that
that
it
was
on
the
last
that
the
company
retains
and
indeed
has
exercised
the
right
to
hire
and
fire
these
agents.
those
are
perhaps
the
principle
elements
on
which
this
record
is
clearer.
we
believe
that
the
prior
record
was
that
the
case
for
the
general
counsel
had
more
witnesses
in
this
particular
hearing.
they
were,
we
think,
more
persuasive
and
then
thorough
witnesses.
in
short,
the
documentary
evidence
is
more
ample
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
control
retained
in
the
fact.
for
example,
the
transfers
of
cases
may
not
be
made
without
the
approval
of
the
company.
there
is,
for
example,
in
this
record
enumeration
of
two
or
three
cases
where
the
approval
was
not
given;
thereby
giving
a
clearer
proof
that
the
right
had
--
the
right
of
control
in
this
respect
had
been
retained.
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
down
through
the
various
elements.
we
believe
that
the
facts
are
much
clearer
on
this.
the
bargaining
unit
involved
in
this
case
is
a
different
one.
this
case
involves
anne
arundel
county
in
baltimore.
the
other
case
involves
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
and
there
are
other
certain
differences
on
the
facts;
some
of
the
agents
in
this
case
came
from
the
quaker
city
life
insurance
company
and
that
made
some
difference
in
the
record
so
that
there
are
some
differences
with
respect
to
the
two
records.
that
if
--
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
should
like
to
save
the
balance
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
to
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
the
first
answer
i
will
give
your
honor,
is
that
the
board
expressly
disavowed
any
reliance
on
the
off
the
stand
demeanor
testimony.
so
that
what
was
before
the
court
was
the
board
order?
so
that
even
though
the
board
had
adopted
the
short
form
order,
which
in
effect
adopted
the
findings
and
decision
of
the
trial
examiner,
they
dropped
the
footnote,
indeed,
from
the
record
to
form
to
call
special
attention
to
it
and
to
say
we
disavow
any
reliance
upon
the
comment
by
the
trial
examiner
with
respect
to
off
stand
demeanor.
that
is
my
first
answer.
my
second
answer
is
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
trial
examiner's
decision
will
demonstrate
that
this
is
pure
dictum,
that
he
said
it
was
pure
dictum
and
that
the
entire
elevation
of
this
issue
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
respondent
is
merely,
and
i
regret
to
say
it
but
it
is
our
view
that
it
is
merely
one
way
of
attempting
to
mask
the
overwhelming
facts
of
this
record
demonstrating
that
these
agents
are
employees.
the
trial
examiner's
decision
is
a
long
and
a
careful
one.
if
you
open
it
to
any
page,
it
relies
as
much
upon
witnesses
called
by
the
respondent,
vice
president
ross,
division
manager
forwaldt,
the
agents
from
st.
paul
street.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
the
examiner
found
that
all
the
testimony
called
by
the
respondent
was
false.
if
you
read
the
examiner's
decision,
you
will
find
that
he
weighed
all
the
evidence
and
that
he
doesn't
give
--
he
does
indeed
give
credence
to
many
of
the
statements
by
the
respondent's
witnesses.
many
of
the
facts
which
mr.
segal
has
said
it
have
admittedly
so
and
did
are
not
admittedly
so.
for
example,
on
page
222
of
the
record,
the
question
is,
“do
you
think
it
is
against
the
rules
for
you
to
get
someone
to
collect
for
you?”
answer,
“if
i
may
you
asked
me,
if
i
thought
it
was
against
the
rules
to
have
an
outsider
and
that's
the
term
you
used,
do
my
work
for
me
and
i
said
yes
and
i
still
say
yes
that
i
consider
it
a
violation
of
the
rules.”
now,
mr.
segal
said
admittedly
there
were
no
individual
meetings.
on
page
632
of
the
record,
the
question
is,
“was
mr.
gore
asked
to
come
in
on
a
day
other
than
his
regular
reporting
day?”
the
witness,
respondent's
witness,
william
h.
forwaldt
answer,
“yes,
he
was”,
page
632
of
the
record.
mr.
segal
states
that
the
headquarters
of
these
agents
are
in
the
home.
if
you
look
them
up
in
the
phonebook,
you
would
find
the
address
and
the
telephone
number
of
that
district
office
of
the
company.
these
employees
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
hierarchy
and
organization
of
the
respondent.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed,
that's
on
the
record.
they
have
no
employees
of
their
own.
the
products
which
they
sell
are
the
respondent's
products.
the
headquarters
which
they
use
is
the
respondent's
headquarters.
the
very
purpose
of
the
district
office
testified
to
by
witnesses
called
by
the
respondent.
the
very
purpose
of
the
district
office
is
because
the
respondent
has
decided
that
that
is
the
best
manner
on
means
it
has
selected
for
carrying
on
its
business.
so
that
the
business
we
are
dealing
with
as
the
organization
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
business
and
organization
of
the
respondents.
these
employees
rely
upon
this
employment,
mr.
justice
harlan,
for
their
livelihood.
whatever
they
may
do
by
way
of
advocation
as
the
salaries
of
$7,000
to
$20,000
demonstrate
and
as
the
record
demonstrates,
many
times,
these
are
full
time
employees.
they
have
no
genuine
bargaining
power
vis-à-vis
the
respondent.
the
company
pays
social
security
tax
payments
which
they
would
not
do
in
terms
of
statutory
provision
that
they
must
be
full
time
insurance
agents
if
the
contribution
is
to
be
made.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
the
company
makes
the
social
security
payments.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
act
does
not
to
it
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
but
if
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
--
there
is
a
provision
which
specifically
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
agents
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
there
are
various
other
requirements
such
as
that
most
of
the
services
must
be
performed
personally
which
is
effective
response
to
the
statement
that
they
may
hire
others,
if
they
do
hire
others
and
they
are
not
performing
the
services
personally.
so
in
response
to
the
particular
part
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
agents
and
provides
various
conditions
they're
not
effective
which,
mr.
justice
black,
is
indeed
that
the
implication
in
that
effect
is
that
these
agents
are
employees
and
not
independent
contractors
that
the
board
was
correct
in
within
its
statutory
finding,
authority
and
finding
them
to
be
employees,
that
the
court
exceeded
any
test
of
law
or
a
fact
of
law.
any
proper
test
of
review,
any
proper
test
of
agency,
any
proper
test
of
law
in
deciding
that
they
were
not
on
the
basis,
we
submit,
of
the
court's
own
approach
to
this
problem.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
no.
i'm
relying
particularly
on
the
section
of
the
act
which
expressly
refers
to
full
time
life
insurance
salesmen,
i
believe.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
not
necessarily.
no.
i'm
merely
calling
attention
to
the
particular
elements
that
the
statute
requires.
full
time
is
one
of
them.
performing
the
services
personally
is
another.
not
making
substantial
investment
is
another
but
the
terms
“employee”
and
“independent
contractor”
are
not
relevant
to
the
particular
payments
on
behalf
of
full
time
life
insurance
agents.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
these
agents
are
under
a
debit
plan
--
excuse
me,
under
a
pension
plan
which
is
in
effect
a
profit
sharing
plan.
the
definition
of
this
plan
applies
to
employees,
the
definition
of
employees
as
drafted
by
the
company
covers
specifically
the
debit
agents.
so
that
there
is
no
concession
by
the
company
that
the
application
of
the
pension
plan
to
the
employees
has
an
--
or
the
word
“employees”
in
that
context
is
applicable
here.
but
yes,
they
do
have
a
pension
plan
and
they
are
covered
by
the
same
pension
plan
and
as
all
other
admitted
employees
of
respondent
are
covered
by.
thank
you
very
much.
