justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
you
or
interrupt
you
but
are
you
saying
it
would
not
raise
a
constitutional
issue
to
charge
a
man
for
the
violation
of
one
statute
and
have
his
conviction
affirmed
for
violation
of
another
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
think
it
would
have
some
bearing
on
that,
on
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
could
not
have
another
because
that
reason,
they
extended
there
heavily
on
the
right
to
privacy.
the
man
might
not
want
anybody.
he
might
not
want
the
government
to
have
that
information,
his
constitutional
right
to
privacy,
would
it
be
invaded
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
breaking
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
an
opinion
for
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
metamor
case?
it
might
have
been.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hadn't
argued,
i
wrote
that
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
1,000
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
i
think
if
--
my
brother
frankfurter
wrote
a
concurring
opinion,
at
least
that's
at
one
meadowmoor
case.
however,
it's
not
an
improper
reading.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
be
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
quite
understood
the
scope
or
part
of
your
argument.
suppose
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
except
the
fact
that
a
man
wanted
to
burn
his
draft
card
not
to
protest
but
he
just
wanted
to
burn
his
draft
card.
would
you
say
that
congress
is
without
power
to
make
it
illegal
to
burn
it
--
engage
in
that
conduct
of
burning
draft
cards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
congress
is
without
power
to
make
it
against
the
law
to
destroy
draft
cards
which
it
has
--
it
should
--
in
order
to
carry
on
its
business
even
without
any
protest
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
to
you
the
difference
between
conduct
and
speech.
that
can
be
speech,
conduct
plus
speech.
there
can
be
a
press
advertising.
there
can
be
marching
backwards
and
forward
engaging
in
conduct,
backwards
and
forward.
have
you
any
case
in
mind
that
has
held
that
the
government
is
without
power
to
regulate
that
kind
of
conduct
even
though
people
want
to
do
it
in
order
to
picket,
in
order
to
express
ideas?
if
so,
what
is
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
will
find
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
which
i
concurred
in
which
we
pointed
out
that
those
things
were
different,
one
was
conduct
and
one
was
speech
and
that
that's
speech
plus
conduct.
have
you
found
any
case
of
this
court
held
without
more
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
state
or
the
federal
government
to
bar
marching
backwards
and
forwards
in
front
of
a
place
in
order
to
protest
something
it's
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
it
become
kind
of
balancing
when
it
shown
that
there's
conduct
plus
speech
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
balance
and
to
find
out
time
opponent
it
is
for
the
government
to
enforce
its
law
against
the
conduct
which
is
included.
as
i
understand
it,
that's
what
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
do
not
think,
i
know
of
no
case
of
this
court
that
has
expressly
held
that
violates
the
constitution
or
the
government
to
regulate
marching
backwards
and
forwards
in
front
of
or
around
the
building,
the
home,
or
anything
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
does
not.
if
you
read
it
carefully,
you
will
see
it
does
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
court
has
held
that
it
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
swing,
was
it
not?
