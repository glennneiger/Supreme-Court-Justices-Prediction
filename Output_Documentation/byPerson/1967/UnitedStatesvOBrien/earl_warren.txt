chief

what
case
of
ours
is
nearest
to
this
case
insofar
as
valid
and
conviction
is
concerned
under
6
or
is
charged
under
3?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
any
decision
that
we
have
rendered
saying
that
a
case
like
this,
for
his
charge,
burning
a
draft
card,
was
sustained
a
conviction
for
his
not
possessing
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
putting
it
on
the
basis
that
you
and
justice
fortas
have
been
discussing,
it
wouldn't
make
a
particular
difference
with
it,
whether
you
did
this
publicly
or
privately
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
maximum
--
are
the
maximum
punishments
for
the
two
crimes
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same.
chief

mr.
karpatkin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
soldier
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
solider
over
in
vietnam
in
front
of
a
large
crowd,
soldiers
broke
his
weapon
and
said
it
was
a
protest
against
the
war
in
the
foreign
policy
of
the
government,
would
that
be
symbolic
speech?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
to
go
a
little
farther
than
just
this
particular
case,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
give
the
government
some
information
needed
in
administering
the
selective
service
act
to
have
a
young
man
carry
a
card
that
would
show
that
he
actually
did
register
in
a
particular
place
as
this
certificate
shows,
farmington,
town
of
farmington,
state
of
massachusetts
and
that
the
date
of
his
registration
was
11
--
12-11-1964
together
with
the
certificate
of
the
board
on
it
to
the
effect
that
he
did
actually
register.
now,
we
have
millions
of
people
in
this
country
floating
around
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another.
a
lot
of
them
are
young
men.
isn't
it
the
government
entitled
to
have
some
knowledge
of
those
facts
as
obtained
from
the
young
men
in
order
to
effectually
administer
the
selective
service
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
young
man
is
found
out
in,
let's
say,
arizona.
he's
19
years
old
and
he
has
the
same
attitude
that
he
has
here
and
he
refuses
to
give
the

any
information
at

and
the

wants
him
to
have
this

so
they
can
know
whether
he

in

massachusetts
or

he
didn't.
don't
you
think
that
might
be
in
the
event
that
a
lot
of
young
men
did
this
same
thing?
don't
you
think
that
that
might
be
a
manner
of
concern
to
the
government?
chief

i
think

had
--
if
the
petitioner,
had
done
this
in
private,
the
privacy
of
his
home
and
his
burned
his
card,
would
you
be
making
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
tell
me
what
cases
you
have
that
would
equate
a
private
burning
of
a
draft
card
contrary
to
the
statute
to
be
symbolic
speech?
chief

yes,
