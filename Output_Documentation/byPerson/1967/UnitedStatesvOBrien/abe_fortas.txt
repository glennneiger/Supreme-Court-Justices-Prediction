is
that
brief
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
referent
of
the
word
“if”
that
it
says
you're
talking
about
the
evidence
or
the
charge?
what
you
have
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
have
here
is
the
specific
statement
in
unmistakable
language
of
the
charge,
namely,
mutilation
or
destruction.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
the
quotation
that
you
have
read
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
language
used
in
the
indictment
has
to
be
susceptible
of
being
construed
as
language
laid
under
one
section
or
the
other
or
under
one
statute
or
the
other;
that's
not
true
here.
all
you
have
here
is
the
argument
that
the
evidence
shows
that
it
could
have
been
charged
with
the
violation
of
6.
but
anyway,
you
said
you're
coming
to
that
later;
so
i
don't
want
press
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
take
it
that
what
you're
doing
is
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
designed
to
punish
contumacious
conduct.
now,
isn't
there
another
approach
to
it,
the
statute
requires
that
these
cards,
draft
cards,
be
kept
on
the
personal
possession
of
the
registrant.
and
that
this
--
is
it
arguable
that
these
provisions
in
(b)
were
to
facilitate
in
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
that
regulatory
provision
that
is
to
say
that
there's
widespread
burning
of
draft
cards
obviously
they'll
be
difficult
to
enforce
that
provision,
requiring
that
the
draft
cards
be
kept
in
personal
possession
of
the
registrant.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
advancing
that
as
a
correct
analysis
but
i
have
them
a
little
surprised
that
is
your
argument
seemed
to
be
pitched
in
terms
of
the
defending
the
statute
as
a
statute
designed
to
punish
contumacious
conduct
which
does
bring
it
closely
and
perhaps
quite
closely
within
the
area
of
free
speech.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
this
covered
by
cole
against
arkansas
just
the
other
way
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there's
no
unfairness
of
charging
one
thing
and
then
justifying
the
conviction
by
some
total
--
reference
to
some
totally
different
acts
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
the
acts
are
different.
one
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
man
was
charged
for
willfully
and
knowingly
mutilating,
destroying
and
changing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
burning.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
to
differ
with
you.
i
shall
think
that
a
lawyer
faced
with
one
charged,
that
is
the
charge
of
burning
would
have
a
test
ahead
of
him
that
differs
in
material
and
important
respects
from
the
defense
of
a
client
charged
with
non-possession
and
that
is
presentation
of
this
case
to
the
jury
as
marshalling
of
evidence.
the
arguments
that
he
presents
might
be
very
different
from
the
one
than
there
would
be
onto
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
a
“verbal
conduct”
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
here,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
to
say,
we're
talking
about
the
burning
of
the
draft
card
and
now
you
can
say
that
that
is
symbolic
first
amendment
expression
if
you
want
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
we're
not
talking
about
verbal.
we're
not
talking
about
anything
he
uttered
here,
are
we
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
was
a
lady,
virginia
killims
(ph)
i
think
it
was
who
protested
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
laws.
tax
laws
require
the
maintenance
of
certain
books
and
records.
suppose
in
order
to
show
her
cons
--
deep
perversion
to
the
tax
laws,
she
had
burned
her
books
and
records
and
done
it
publicly.
would
that
fall
in
the
same
category
as
your
draft
case
and
would
you
defend
it
on
the
same
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
you
personally.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
problem
because
now
you're
right
back
to
a
defense
to
an
attack
upon
the
requirement
of
possession
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
a
draft
card.
but
in
the
killims
(ph)
case,
well
--
and
you
seem
to
concede
that
if
there
is
a
valid
governmental
purpose
attached
to
the
object,
the
burning
of
that
object
can
be
criminally
punished
regardless
of
the
impact
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do
and
i
want
to
know
where
you
--
how
you
--
if
how
in
your
minds
hide
the
scale
tips?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
it
was
an
enforcement,
provides,
to
help
identify
people
who
have
registered.
justice
abe
fortas
collective
service
registration,
no?
justice
abe
fortas
but
somebody
might
think
of
it
as
insulting
and
unpatriotic
to
break
a
window
in
the
whitehouse
but
i
suppose
you
could
also
--
the
person
who
did
it
could
also
be
punished
criminally
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
might
do
it
to
--
as
an
expression
of
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
than
to
be
all
of
those
things,
couldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
has
--
have
you
got
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
ever
invalidated
the
statutes
solely
because
of
an
improper
motive
on
the
part
of
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
was
commenting
on
yours
beforehand.
justice
abe
fortas
he
said
not
--
we
haven't
yet
explicitly
done
that.
that's
the
answer
i
wanted.
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
you
have
no
authority
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
support
your
argument
that
this
court
may
look
at
the
motive
of
congress
and
solely
at
the
motive
of
congress
and
on
that
basis
invalidate
the
statute
as
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
also
true
of
course
that
not
all
action
is
speech,
not
all
action
is
symbolic
speech.
some
action
is
symbolic
speech;
not
all
action
is
symbolic
speech.
justice
abe
fortas
your
problem
is
where
does
this
fall
and
that
all
embracing
duality
of
propositions.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
somebody,
as
an
act
of
protest
throws
his
quivering
body
in
front
of
or
on
the
railroad
tracks
and
insists
on
staying
there
to
--
and
blocks
passenger
trains.
now
is
that
symbolic
speech
or
is
that
outside
of
the
--
or
is
it
action
which
cannot
be
defended
as
symbolic
speech
because
it
is
an
interference
with
the
rights
of
others.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
problem
--
and
so
your
problem
here
is
whether
this
is
protected,
as
i
see
at
the
moment
anyway,
is
whether
this
is
protected
as
symbolic
speech
or
whether
it
is
an
unprotected
interference
with
the
process
of
government,
with
a
legitimate
process
of
government.
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
simplify
if
that's
the
only
problem
that
we
have
here.
that
simplifies
a
great
--
but
is
that
your
total
submission.
do
you
say
that
we
have
to
find
that
this
act
was
animated
by
an
improper
motive
on
the
part
of
congress
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
result
you
seek?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
tell
me
what
they
are
because
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
have
great
difficulty
of
reaching
a
result
here
based
upon
which
requires
this
court
to
act
on
the
--
as
a
result
of
an
assessment
of
the
motivation
of
the
congress.
so
what
are
your
other
grounds?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
--
and
that's
because
you're
--
you
say
that
it
does
not
--
that
it
is
essentially
expression,
communication
of
a
point
of
view,
number
one.
number
two,
that
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
others
or
with
the
exercise,
performance
or
execution
of
any
legitimate
government
function.
and
don't
--
is
that
the
--
am
i
stating
the
position
correctly?
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
unless
we
cross
the
first
one,
unless
we
accept
your
first
position
that
this
is
to
be
considered
as
if
it
were
speech.
if
we
consider
it
not
as
speech
but
as
action
which
interferes
with
the
rights
of
others,
which
is
an
aggression
on
the
rights
of
others
or
an
aggression
on
the
performance
of
governmental
functions,
do
we
still
have
to
reach
clear
and
present
danger?
justice
abe
