how
old
is
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
person
can
be
sentenced
under
that
act
up
to
what
age
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
21?
justice
potter
stewart
when
the
offense
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
very
obvious
difference
in
that
case,
isn't
it?
that
involved
an
affront
upon
this
--
the
aesthetic
sensibilities
of
other
people.
it
was
not
unlike
a
common
law
nuisance.
in
the
present
case,
i
guess
does
not
involved
that,
does
not
have
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
no
injury
to
other
people
is
there
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose,
somebody
who
had
a
very
sincere
belief
that
the
laws
against
robbery
were
all
wrong
could
not
go
express
that
belief
by
going
around
and
robbing
houses
because
that
would
be
injuring
other
people.
but
here,
you
don't
have
any
of
that
quality,
do
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
present
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what

the
defense
of
this
case
in
the
trial
court?
you
told
us
that
the
defendant
admitted
at
least
these
arguments
to
the
jury.
he
didn't
take
the
stand
himself
but
that
he
conceded
that
he'd
violated
the
statutes.

potter
stewart
go
ahead,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
government
argue
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
is
this
something
that
judge
aldrich
thought
up
on
his
own?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course,
i
realize
that

wonder
if
they
had

stewart
--
fall
back
position.

there
not?
