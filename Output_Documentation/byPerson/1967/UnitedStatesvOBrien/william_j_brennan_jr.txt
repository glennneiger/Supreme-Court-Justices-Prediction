what
was
that
charge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
violation
in
section
6,
mr.
solicitor?
is
there
a
charge
of
violation
of
section
6?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
that's
part
of
what?
may
i
ask
you,
if
this
is
--
is
it
--
this
is
the
charge
in
page
3,
is
this
the
only
one
we're
dealing
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
that
is
relied
upon
to
support,
the
conviction
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
both
3
and
6,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
you'd
still
say
this
although
this
charge
is
only
mutilate,
destroy
and
change
by
burning
a
certificate
without
identification
of
section
3,
i
take
it
you'd
make
the
same
argument
even
had
the
pleading
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
identified
this
to
section
3
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
charge
doesn't
even
refer
to
this
section
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
this
charge
was
that
he
had
willfully
placed
the
--
this
certificate
in
his
dresser
--
drawer
all
the
reason,
that
you
now
say
that
he
burned
up
this
way.
would
you
be
--
make
any
different
argument?
he
said
nothing
about
it
with
no
media
person
and
no
publicity
to
it
but
the
government
discovered
he
didn't
carry
it
because
for
all
other
reasons
he
burned
it
here,
he
hid
it
or
put
it
away
on
his
dresser-drawer
and
walked
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
the
first
amendment
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
would
nevertheless
be
otherwise
urging
your
first
amendment
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
“manifestation”
you
mean
same
public
manifestation?
in
other
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
are
you
making
a
special
point
of
the
fact
that
this
was
done
publicly
in
the
presence
of
news
media
with
photographs
taken
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
--
in
the
hypothetical
i've
put
to
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
symbolic
speech
requires
some
public
manifestation,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
my
hypothetical,
you
look
--
be
hard
for
--
to
it
to
find
any
transmission
and
reception,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
probably
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
serves
only
a
notification
purpose,
a
lot
of
other
information
on
it,
i'm
sure.
then
does
want
to
have
to
be
told
the
date
of
his
birth?
it
has
that
on
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
place
of
his
birth?
do
i
have
to
be
told
the
place
of
my
birth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
tells
the
name
and
address
of
some
person
who
will
always
know
my
address,
the
color
of
my
eyes,
the
color
of
my
hair,
my
height,
my
weight,
do
i
have
to
be
told
those
things
if
this
serves
only
a
notification
purpose
to
me
in
my
classification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps,
it
serves
some
other
governmental
purpose.
your
suggestion
is
that
all
it
does
is
to
serve,
as
i
understood
you
in
your
colloquy
in
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
only
legitimate
purpose
is
that
notifies
you
is
that
draft
classification.
and
once
you
get
it,
you've
got
the
notice
and
otherwise,
it
serves
no
purpose.
but
obviously
there's
a
lot
of
information
on
that
which
serves,
must
serve
other
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
obviously,
it
must
serve
a
purpose
of
identification,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
only
in
registration
but
of
identification.
it
has
a
lot
of
things,
including
indeed
that
this
one
does,
i
noticed.
obvious
physical
characteristics,
scars
on
right
shoulder
and
wears
eyeglass.
and
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
why
isn't
it
obviously
prepared
this
way
and
required
to
be
carried
so
that
the
government
may
be
in
a
position
to
enforce
the
requirements
of
the
selective
service
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
typically,
you
have
a
difficult
enough
constitutional
question
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
what
congress
had
in
mind
was,
now
despite
of
this
form
of
dissent
because
of
its
effect
upon
the
enforcement
of
the
selective
service,
would
you
still
say
that
that
was
an
illegitimate
purpose?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that
charge

a
