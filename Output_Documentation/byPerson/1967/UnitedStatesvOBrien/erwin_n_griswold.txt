mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it
raises
the
question
of
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
amendment
which
congress
passed
in
august
1965
to
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
the
nature
of
the
statutory
provision
involved
can
best
be
seen
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
which
sets
out
that
section
12
(b)
of
what
is
often
called
the
selective
service
act.
that
is
the
general
criminal
provision
of
the
selective
service
act,
making
a
large
number
of
specified
actions
subject
to
criminal
penalty
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
first
at
paragraph
6
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
the
section
begins:
“any
person”
in
(6),
“who
annoyingly
violates
or
evades
any
of
the
provision
of
this
title
or
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
thereto,
relating
to
the
issuance,
transfer
or
possession
of
such
certificate
shall
upon
conviction”
and
so
on.
then,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
paragraph
3
at
the
middle
of
page
3,
which
is
the
paragraph
directly
involved
in
this
case,
until
1965
it
contained
the
words
which
are
not
printed
in
italics,
making
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
forge,
alter
or
in
any
manner
change
any
such
certificate
and
what
congress
did
in
1965
was
to
add
the
forewords
which
are
printed
in
italics,
“knowingly
destroys,
knowingly
mutilates”.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
in
june
1966
before
judge
sweeney
in
a
jury.
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
no
counsel
at
the
trial.
this
was
his
own
choice
and
judge
sweeney
took
pains
to
see
that
he
was
advised
as
to
his
rights
or
that
he
understood
his
rights.
in
this
connection,
it
should
also
be
observed
that
he
had
counsel
at
his
arraignment.
that
an
appearance
was
entered
for
him;
that
he
obviously
had
counsel
in
preparing
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
he
filed
on
constitutional
grounds
and
that
he
has
the
help
of
counsel
in
this
court
as
he
had
in
the
court
below.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
was
not
in
dispute.
it
showed
that
the
defendant
and
three
others
burned
small
white
cards
on
the
steps
of
the
south
boston
courthouse
on
march
31,
1966
in
the
presence
of
a
sizable
crowd.
four
photographs
of
this
event
were
introduced
into
evidence
and
they
appear
at
pages
48
to
51
of
the
record.
photographs
of
the
remnant
of
the
draft
card
itself
were
also
received
in
evidence
and
can
be
found
on
pages
52
and
53
of
the
record.
immediately
after
the
event
and
after
he
had
been
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
have
counsel,
the
defendant
told
an
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
and
this
is
on
page
11
of
the
record:
“i
asked
him
what
he
had
done,
what
he
had
burned”,
said
the
agent.
“he
told
me
that
he
had
burned
a
selective
service
certificate
and
that
he
knew
it
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
but
that
he
had
his
own
beliefs
and
his
own
philosophies
why
he
did
it.
and
he
produced
the
charred
remains
of
the
selective
service
certificate
which
he
showed
me
and
it
was
in
an
envelope.
i
asked
him
if
it
is
alright
if
i
photographed
it
and
he
said
it
was
perfectly
alright.
and
i
called
in
special
agent
burnt
who
was
with
me
and
we
photographed
the
remains”.
the
defendant
did
not
testify
nor
call
any
witnesses
but
he
did
make
an
argument
to
the
jury
at
--
during
which
he
stated,
and
this
is
on
page
29
of
the
record
and,
“i
don't
contest
the
fact
that
i
did
burn
my
draft
card
because
i
did”.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
after
a
careful
consideration
which
is
fully
disclosed
on
the
record,
judge
sweeney
sentenced
the
defendant
under
the
youth
correction
act.
in
the
defendant's
brief,
this
is
referred
to
as
a
six-year
maximum
indeterminate
sentence
and
in
a
very
real
sense
it
is.
but
it
is
also
quite
different
from
an
ordinary
sentence
because
it
can
be
much
shorter
than
the
maximum
and
it
can
be
terminated
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
the
defendant
with
no
criminal
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
19
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
when
the
offense
is
committed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21.
when
the
case
went
to
the
united
states'
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
that
court
in
an
opinion
by
judge
aldrich
held
that
the
1965
amendment
which
made
draft
card
burning
specifically
an
offense
was
unconstitutional
as
a
suppression
of
symbolic
speech.
having
reached
the
result
of
unconstitutionality
however,
judge
aldrich
then
exercised
the
certain
measure
of
what
might
be
called
yankee
ingenuity.
he
held
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
should
nevertheless
be
sustained
because
the
facts
necessarily
prove
to
support
the
draft
card
burning
charge
inevitably
clude
--
included
proof
of
a
related
offense,
namely,
not
being
in
possession
of
a
draft
card
as
required
by
the
selective
service
regulations
and
made
an
offense
under
paragraph
6
of
the
statute
to
which
i've
already
referred.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
judge
aldrich
said
it
was
an
included
offense.
i
would
support
the
result
on
a
slightly
different
verbal
formulation
that
it
was
an
offense
the
facts
of
which
were
proved
and
the
fact
that
the
government
appeared
to
proceed
under
a
different
clause
of
the
statute
didn't
negative
the
validity
of
the
conviction
when
the
facts
proved
showed
a
violation
of
section
6
even
though
section
3
was
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
question
with
respect
to
section
6
and
the
possession
offense
is
the
issue
in
number
233,
the
respondent's
petition.
i
would
prefer
to
deal
with
that
after
i've
dealt
with
the
constitution
argument
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
--
the
indictment
is
on
page
3
and
that
is
the
entire
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
your
honor.
from
this
result,
both
parties
sought
certiorari
and
the
grant
of
both
petitions
brings
the
case
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
insofar
as
–
are
you
talking
about
the
constitutional
argument
now,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
the
recent
case
which
is
closest
to
it
is
united
states
against
hutcheson
in
312
u.s.
where
the
court
said,
“in
order
to
determine
whether
an
indictment
charges
an
offense
against
the
united
states,
designated
by
the
pleader
of
the
statute
under
--
an
offense
designation
by
the
pleader
of
the
statute
under
which
he
purported,
delay
the
charge
is
immaterial.
he
may
have
conceived
the
charge
under
one
statute
which
would
not
sustain
the
indictment
but
it
may
nevertheless
come
within
the
terms
of
another
statute.
now,
here
it
is
not
really
another
statute,
it's
another
clause
of
the
same
statute
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
burned
his
draft
card
and
it
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
that
that
he
was
thereafter
not
in
possession
of
the
draft
card.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
you
get
to
only
if
you
decide
against
us
on
the
constitutional
issue
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
had
regarded
it
as
a
subordinate
issue
and
had
planned
to
deal
with
it
later.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
if
the
facts
which
were
required
to
prove
the
first
offense
were
also
facts
which
would
prove
the
second
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position,
your
honor.
it
is
not
verbally
so
but
it
is
logical.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
make
the
same
argument
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
even
if
it
had
referred
to
section
3,
under
our
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
government
has
brought
an
indictment
under
one
section
of
the
revised
statutes
or
of
the
criminal
code
and
this
court
has
sustained
the
conviction
under
another
section
of
the
revised
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
charge
does
not
refer
to
the
section
at
all
and
it
is
all
under
the
same
section.
i
think
we
got
into
this
by
my
saying
that
though
judge
aldrich
had
recalled
it
a
lesser
included
offense,
i
did
not
regard
it
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
regarded
it
as
another
offense
under
the
same
section.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
certainly
is
the
primary
question
to
which
i
will
now
turn.
on
the
government's
petition,
no.
232,
there
is
only
a
question
of
constitutional
law.
there's
no
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute,
no
question
as
to
the
effect
or
the
weight
of
evidence.
the
facts
are
clear
and
as
i've
indicated
in
effect
admitted.
on
its
face,
there
can
be
no
constitutional
question
about
the
statute.
it
forbids
the
doing
of
an
act:
knowingly
destroys,
knowingly
mutilates.
the
contention
is
made,
however,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
act
constitutes
symbolic
speech
and
that
congress
cannot
proscribe
it
because
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment's
provision
of
laws
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
of
course,
it
is
clear
that
there
can
be
symbolic
speech
or
to
put
it
another
way
that
acts
may
be
in
effect
a
speech
though
they
are
not
vocal,
oral,
by
voice,
a
nod,
the
shake
of
the
head,
a
wink,
a
raising
of
an
eyebrow
at
an
auction
sale,
a
gesture
such
thumbs
down
may
be
modes
of
communication
and
one
can
readily
think
of
circumstances
under
which
congress
could
not
forbid
them
as
for
example
on
the
case
of
an
address
delivered
by
hand
signals
to
an
audience
of
deaf
persons.
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
all
acts
are
the
equivalent
of
speech
or
that
congress
cannot
forbid
them
even
though
there
is
an
element
of
communication
in
them.
i
suppose
that
assaulting
an
official
of
the
selective
service
system
could
be
thought
of
as
symbolic
speech
or
breaking
a
window
of
this
court
building
under
certain
circumstances.
in
a
sense,
refusing
to
report
for
induction
could
be
argued
to
be
symbolic
speech.
it
seems
equally
clear
that
all
of
these
acts
can
be
made
unlawful
by
congress.
in
an
effort
to
test
this
problem,
there
is
one
case
which
this
court
has
considered
which
i
think
is
entirely
out
of
the
emotional
zone
and
therefore
it
may
be
of
a
particular
use
in
considering
this
question.
this
is
people
against
stover
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief.
that
is
the
case
which
came
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
it
involved
a
married
couple
in
new
rochelle,
new
york
who
thought
their
taxes
were
too
high
and
so
they
strung
dirty
clothes
and
underwear
and
odds
and
ends
of
unattractive
things
on
a
clothesline
in
front
of
their
house
and
each
year
that
they
didn't
get
their
taxes
reduced,
they
put
up
another
clothesline
so
that
in
time,
they
had
six,
both
in
the
front
and
in
the
side
of
their
yard.
and
thereafter,
after
the
clothesline
were
up,
the
city
of
new
rochelle
passed
an
ordinance
making
it
illegal
to
have
clotheslines
on
the
front
or
side
of
a
house
abutting
the
street
with
certain
exceptions
in
cases
of
necessity
and
the
defendants
in
that
case
did
not
claim
the
necessity.
they
were
then
prosecuted
under
this
city
ordinance
and
were
convicted.
they
took
their
case
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
very
carefully
considered
in
an
opinion
by
then
judge
fuld,
who
considered
expressly
the
first
amendment
argument
that
this
putting
up
of
the
clothesline
was
symbolic
speech
intended
to
show
their
opposition
to
the
local
government
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
and
then
not
content
with
that,
the
parties
filed
an
appeal
to
this
court
and
in
375
u.s.,
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
see
that
that
--
no
i
find
nothing
of
aesthetic
about
this
case.
i
don't
see
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
see
that
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
issue
which
seems
to
me
to
--
be
the
one
in
which
in
that
case
is
parallel
with
what
is
here
which
is
whether
this
is
symbolic
speech.
and
if
it
is,
whether
it
can
be
proscribed
by
a
law
enacted
or
putting
it
another
way,
whether
that
law
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
which
is
of
course
is
binding
on
congress
in
which
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
equally
applicable
to
the
city
of
new
rochelle
in
that
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
don't
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
quality
but
we
do
maintain
that
there
was
a
valid
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
not
aesthetics
to
be
sure
but
one
related
to
the
effective
operation
of
the
selective
service
system,
which
is
within
the
power
expressly
granted
to
congress
to
reasons
support
armies
and
to
enact
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
out
the
foregoing
powers.
now
let
me
see
if
i
can
help
to
answer
your
question
by
turning
to
another
one
which
is
more
emotional
of
the
flag.
neither
side
here
has
made
much
reference
to
the
flag.
i
suppose
because
it
comes
close
to
the
line.
of
course,
the
flag
is
a
symbol
and
burning
or
defiling
a
flag
could
be
regarded
as
symbolic
speech.
as
things
have
developed
in
this
country,
legislation
with
respect
to
desecration
of
the
flag
has
been
almost
entirely
left
to
the
states.
nearly
every
state
has
such
a
statute.
the
only
act
of
congress
relates
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
applicable
to
anyone
who
shall
publicly
mutilate,
the
same
word
as
we
have
here,
deface,
defile
or
defy,
trample
upon
or
cast
contempt
either
by
word
or
action
upon
any
such
flag.
that's
title
iv
of
the
united
states
code,
section
3.
can
there
be
any
doubt
about
the
validity
of
such
a
statute?
i
would
have
thought
not
and
similar
legislation
has
been
applied
in
many
states
decisions.
of
course,
a
draft
card
is
not
a
flag.
nevertheless,
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
symbol
of
public
authority.
i
suppose
that
the
fact
that
it
is
such
a
symbol
as
what
makes
it
attracted
to
burning.
is
it
not
clear
that
maintaining
public
authority,
not
suppression
of
speech
but
simply
maintaining
public
authority,
is
a
proper
exercise
of
government
and
specifically
has
something
which
congress
could
properly
regard
as
necessary
and
proper
to
the
effective
exercise
of
its
undoubted
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
the
defendant
relies
extensively
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
amendment.
he
makes
extensive
arguments
about
the
difference
between
motive
behind
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
are,
i
regret
to
say,
too
elusive
for
me
to
comprehend.
even
on
the
defendant's
ground
though,
the
legislative
history
which
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
defendant's
brief,
seems
that
best
equivocal
to
me.
i
think
i
should
mention
that
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
which
the
defendants
sets
out,
and
i
only
became
aware
of
this
myself
yesterday
afternoon,
there
is
four
pages
of
what
i
suppose
technically
would
be
called
“hearing”
before
the
house
armed
services
committee
dated
august
6,
1965.
however,
when
this
is
examined,
it
is
not
a
hearing
in
the
usual
sense
and
that
there
were
no
outside
witnesses.
the
only
persons
who
participated
were
members
of
the
committee
and
that
does
affect
the
--
in
effect
the
proceedings
of
the
committee
at
the
time
that
they
adopted
the
report
which
was
presented
to
the
house.
only
three
members
of
both
houses
spoke
at
all,
two
congressmen
and
one
senator.
the
house
passed
the
bill
by
a
vote
of
393
to
1.
the
senate
passed
the
bill
by
a
voice
vote
without
a
roll
call.
there
were
two
committee
reports
by
the
two
armed
services
committee.
the
earlier
report
is
that
of
the
committee
of
the
house
and
it
states
that
the
states
--
the
purpose
of
the
bill
in
these
terms,
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
legislation
is
to
provide
a
clear
statutory
prohibition
against
the
person
knowingly
destroying
or
knowingly
mutilating
a
draft
registration
card.
and
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
said,
if
allowed
to
continue
unchecked,
referring
to
draft
card
burning,
this
contumacious
conduct
represents
a
potential
threat
to
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
and
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
that
is
true.
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
that
and
there
had
then
been
publicity
to
it,
that
might
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
impact
of
this
is
of
course,
in
its
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
says
nothing
about
that.
i
recognized
the
statute
was
of
course
enacted
to
meet
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
public
burning
of
draft
cards.
in
united
states
against
miller,
where
this
same
question
was
considered
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
its
cited
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
said
and
this
bears
on
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
proper
functioning
of
the
system
depends
upon
the
aggregated
consequences
of
individual
acts
in
raising
an
army
no
less
than
in
regulating
commerce.
the
seriousness
of
an
individual's
acts
must
often
be
assessed
not
only
in
isolation
but
under
the
assumption
that
they
may
be
multiplied
manifold.
therefore,
the
interest
to
be
served,
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
selective
system
is
furthered
by
the
statute
under
attack.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
certainly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
certainly
had
no
intention,
your
honor,
to
waive
or
to
ignore
the
other
line
of
argument
which
supports
the
statute.
it
is
dealt
with
at
length
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
in
united
states
against
miller.
particularly
at
the
bottom
of
page
80
and
81
of
that
opinion
where
a
considerable
number
of
ways
in
which
the
draft
card
can
be
useful
in
the
administration
of
the
system
are
set
forth.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
place
where
that
this
is
more
fully
or
comprehensively
stated
than
in
that
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
and
i
surely
intend
to
rely
on
it.
to
begin
with,
the
court
says
the
notice
of
classification
serves
as
proof
of
registration
and
it
also
contains
complete
information
as
to
a
registrant's
classification
including
the
type
and
date
thereof
and
the
period
for
which
it
is
effective.
thus
inability
to
produce
the
card
provides
an
easy
means
of
initially
detecting
those
attempting
to
evade
their
selective
service
obligations
and
this
goes
on
with
other
potential
users
of
a
draft
card
for
about
a
column
and
that
of
course,
i
intended
to
rely
on
them.perhaps,
it
was
because
i
was
trying
not
to
dodge
away
from
what
might
be
regarded
as
the
hard
part
of
the
argument
that
i
came
in
to
the
other
part
first.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
make
--
it
would
make
no
difference
whatever.
that
runs
into
another
problem
and
that
the
offense
then
isn't
essentially
different
from
not
being
in
possession
of
a
draft
card
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
moment.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
a
defendant's
brief;
that
this
statute
labors
under
some
sort
of
infirmity
because
congress
passed
it
on
its
own
initiative
and
without
any
prodding
from
the
selective
service
system
or
other
officers
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
this
seems
a
rather
noble
point
where
usually
told
that
the
executive
interferes
to
much
in
the
workings
of
the
congress.
that
congress
should
itself
determine
what
are
to
be
the
laws
of
the
lands
should
need
no
defense.
certainly,
it
is
not
a
basis
for
showing
that
the
statute
passed
by
congress
is
unconstitutional.
congress
did
not
forbid
dissent.
it
could
not
do
that.
o'brien
was
free
at
all
times
to
express
dissent
by
speech
from
the
courthouse
steps
or
on
the
street
corners,
by
letters
to
the
editor,
by
pamphlet,
by
radio
and
television.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
the
line
between
a
speech
and
no
speech
where
the
answer
would
be
clear
in
favor
of
speech.
for
the
contention
of
the
defendant
is
not
that
he
can
speak
which
of
course
he
can
but
rather
that
he
can
do
acts
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
been
forbidden
by
that
formal
action
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
congress
assembled
which
we
call
a
statute.
of
course,
a
statute
must
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
constitution.
this
one,
we
submit
does.
in
terms
it
forbids
an
act
clearly
and
specifically
so
that
there's
no
question
of
over
breadth
or
vagueness.
the
defendant
knew
exactly
what
was
forbidden
and
what
he
was
doing.
what
he
did
clearly
constituted
an
interference
with
the
effective
operation
of
the
selective
service
system
and
congress
as
the
legislative
arm
of
the
government,
acting
according
to
its
judgment
determined
that
this
should
be
unlawful.
since
there
was
no
real
impairment
of
any
right
to
speak
and
since
adequate
other
avenues
of
communication
were
always
open
to
the
defendant,
the
contention
of
the
defendants'
action
was
symbolic
speech
should
not
take
away
from
congress
the
power
to
do
what
it
regarded
as
necessary
and
proper
in
order
to
carry
out
its
power
granted
by
the
constitution
to
raise
and
support
armies.
as
this
court
said
in
the
giboney
against
the
empire
storage
company
case,
it
is
never
been
deemed
an
abridgment
of
freedom
of
speech
suppressed
to
make
a
course
of
conduct
illegal
merely
because
the
conduct
was
in
part
initiated,
evidenced
or
carried
out
by
means
of
language
either
spoken,
written
or
printed.
one
other
point
is
made
by
the
defendant.
he
says
that
since
non-possession
of
a
draft
card
was
already
forbidden,
it
follows
that
when
congress
forbad
draft
card
burning,
the
only
purpose
in
effect
to
the
statute
was
to
abridge
symbolic
speech.
it
is
true
that
congress
from
the
beginning
of
the
draft
laws
and
specifically
in
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
passed
in
1948
has
made
it
a
crime
knowingly
to
violate
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
under
the
statute
relating
to
the
issuance,
transfer
or
possession
of
certificates
under
the
draft
law.
either
or
both
the
registration
certification
and
the
classification
certificate
are
generally
lumped
together
in
the
term
“draft
cards”.
regulations
under
the
act
have
long
provided
that
a
registrant
must
have
in
his
personal
possession
at
all
times
his
registration
certificate
and
his
notice
of
classification
if
he
has
been
classified.
again,
it
is
odd
that
congress
should
be
regarded
as
under
a
disability
because
it
has
shown
to
--
chosen
to
put
into
a
statute
something
which
is
closely
related
to
a
regulation.
some
might
think
it
better
for
the
law
to
be
stated
in
what
congress
has
itself
written
rather
than
by
delegated
executive
action.
moreover,
the
regulation
could
be
changed
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
might
be
subject
to
attack
on
grounds
of
construction,
or
vagueness,
or
a
lack
of
validly
delegated
authority.
the
statute
is
clear
and
specific
and
subject
to
change
only
by
congress.
it
should
surely
spend
no
lower
constitutionally
or
otherwise
because
it
was
preceded
and
is
today
accompanied
by
a
closely
related
regulation.
the
statutes
on
the
regulation
are
not
coextensive.
the
regulation
deals
with
what
might
be
called
a
status
of
non-possession.
it
might
apply,
for
example
to
a
man
who
lost
his
draft
card
and
then
deliberately
and
willfully
did
not
seek
a
replacement
while
the
statute
pinpoints
a
particular
act,
which
results
in
loss
of
possession.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
is
constitutional.application
of
the
statute
does
not
hinder
protected
methods
of
protest.
on
its
face,
the
law
forbids
an
act
and
represents
a
reasonable
judgment
by
congress,
that
one
who
either
knowingly
destroys
or
knowingly
mutilates
a
draft
card
does
an
act
which
impairs
the
effective
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system.
that
legislative
determination,
we
submit,
should
be
deemed
to
fall
within
the
bounds
of
congressional
power.
i
now
turn
to
the
question
raised
in
number
233,
which
is
the
defendant's
position
as
i've
already
pointed
out
it
need
not
be
reached
if
our
contention
as
to
constitutionality
is
maintained.
this
is
a
question
whether
the
conviction
can
be
sustained
even
though
the
amendment
to
clause
3
of
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it
amounts
to
a
charge
of
a
non-possession.
as
i've
said,
judge
aldrich
said
that
this
was
a
lesser
included
offense,
we
would
differ
verbally
with
this
and
the
offense
of
non-possession
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
it's
an
offense
under
the
same
section
of
the
statute
and
subject
to
the
same
penalty.
we
would
suggest
the
conclusion,
we
would
support
the
conclusion
of
the
judge
on
the
ground
that
the
facts
alleged
were
sufficient
to
embrace
the
offense
of
non-possession;
that
the
facts
proved
clearly
showed
non-possession
and
that
there
is
no
unfairness
to
the
defendant
in
this
as
he
was
in
no
sense
taken
by
surprise.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we
at
least,
your
honor,
we
have
sought
to
distinguish
cole
against
arkansas
on
pages
34
and
35
of
our
brief.
there,
there
was
a
real
shift
so
that
the
defendant
was
taken
by
surprise
and
there
was
a
clear
element
of
unfairness.
we
think
that
there
is
no
unfairness
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
at
all
--
your
honor,
i
beg
not
a
totally
different
act,
the
very
same
section
of
the
same
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
different
clause
of
the
same
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
logically
embraces
the
fact
of
non-possession.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
they
were
substantially
different,
i
would
agree
on
you
with
this.
i
think
our
case
on
this
point
turns
on
the
fact
that
as
we
see
it
there
is
no
substantial
difference
when
you
get
right
down
to
what's
involved.
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
defense
was
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
filed
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
had
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
the
jury
was
called
on
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
think
judge
sweeney
passed
on
that
by
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
jury
simply
decided
to
question
the
fact
whether
he
did
burned
his
draft
card,
which,
i
repeat,
logically
requires
a
conclusion
that
he
was
there
after
not
in
possession
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
would've
been
exactly
the
same
on
the
charged
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
right.
defendant
makes
several
closely
related
points
at
the
end
of
his
brief.
he
contends
that
the
sentence
was
so
excessive
as
to
constitute
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
he
further
objects
to
the
words
or
conduct
of
the
district
judge.
with
respect
to
this,
it
should
be
observed
that
they
were
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
those
are
not
before
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
court,
the
entire
proceedings
on
the
sentence
are
on
the
record.
when
this
court
reads
this
portion
of
the
record,
it
will
see
i
think
the
concern
of
the
judge
about
this
difficult
case
and
the
care
that
he
took
in
the
performance
of
the
duty
which
was
his.
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
in
the
same,
(inaudible)
the
same
words.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
penalty
is
entirely
on
the
final
clause
of
this
section
which
has
six
clauses.
clause
3
is
the
one
in
which
the
knowingly
burns,
knowingly
mutilates
was
inserted
and
clause
6
is
the
one
that
deals
with
violation
of
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
something
i
believe
that
judge
aldrich
set
up
on
his
own.
i
don't
believe
this
was
argued
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government's
position
there
was
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
they
tried
to
put
a
second
line
of
defense
at
that
point.
whatever
feelings
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
on
limitations.
i
believe
it
is
six
years
under
the
selective
service
act
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i
simply
am
not
informed
as
to
what
the
statute
of
limitations
if
--
whether
there
is
special
one
for
this
or
whether
it
comes
under
the
general
act.
whatever
feelings
of
compassion
or
regret
one
may
have
for
the
defendant
in
his
situation,
it's
clear
that
he
violated
the
law.
we
submit
that
the
law
was
validly
made
and
that
it
is
not
fairly
to
be
regarded
as
an
abridgment
of
freedom
of
speech
when
it
does
not
involve
speech
in
anyway
and
when
all
avenues
of
speech
remain
open
to
the
defendant.
congress
could
conclude
that
the
law
it
passed
bears
a
proper
relation
to
the
maintenance
of
effective
self-government.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it
raises
the
question
of
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
amendment
which
congress
passed
in
august
1965
to
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
the
nature
of
the
statutory
provision
involved
can
best
be
seen
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
which
sets
out
that
section
12
(b)
of
what
is
often
called
the
selective
service
act.
that
is
the
general
criminal
provision
of
the
selective
service
act,
making
a
large
number
of
specified
actions
subject
to
criminal
penalty
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
first
at
paragraph
6
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
the
section
begins:
“any
person”
in
(6),
“who
annoyingly
violates
or
evades
any
of
the
provision
of
this
title
or
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
thereto,
relating
to
the
issuance,
transfer
or
possession
of
such
certificate
shall
upon
conviction”
and
so
on.
then,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
paragraph
3
at
the
middle
of
page
3,
which
is
the
paragraph
directly
involved
in
this
case,
until
1965
it
contained
the
words
which
are
not
printed
in
italics,
making
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
forge,
alter
or
in
any
manner
change
any
such
certificate
and
what
congress
did
in
1965
was
to
add
the
forewords
which
are
printed
in
italics,
“knowingly
destroys,
knowingly
mutilates”.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
in
june
1966
before
judge
sweeney
in
a
jury.
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
no
counsel
at
the
trial.
this
was
his
own
choice
and
judge
sweeney
took
pains
to
see
that
he
was
advised
as
to
his
rights
or
that
he
understood
his
rights.
in
this
connection,
it
should
also
be
observed
that
he
had
counsel
at
his
arraignment.
that
an
appearance
was
entered
for
him;
that
he
obviously
had
counsel
in
preparing
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
he
filed
on
constitutional
grounds
and
that
he
has
the
help
of
counsel
in
this
court
as
he
had
in
the
court
below.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
was
not
in
dispute.
it
showed
that
the
defendant
and
three
others
burned
small
white
cards
on
the
steps
of
the
south
boston
courthouse
on
march
31,
1966
in
the
presence
of
a
sizable
crowd.
four
photographs
of
this
event
were
introduced
into
evidence
and
they
appear
at
pages
48
to
51
of
the
record.
photographs
of
the
remnant
of
the
draft
card
itself
were
also
received
in
evidence
and
can
be
found
on
pages
52
and
53
of
the
record.
immediately
after
the
event
and
after
he
had
been
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
have
counsel,
the
defendant
told
an
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
and
this
is
on
page
11
of
the
record:
“i
asked
him
what
he
had
done,
what
he
had
burned”,
said
the
agent.
“he
told
me
that
he
had
burned
a
selective
service
certificate
and
that
he
knew
it
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
but
that
he
had
his
own
beliefs
and
his
own
philosophies
why
he
did
it.
and
he
produced
the
charred
remains
of
the
selective
service
certificate
which
he
showed
me
and
it
was
in
an
envelope.
i
asked
him
if
it
is
alright
if
i
photographed
it
and
he
said
it
was
perfectly
alright.
and
i
called
in
special
agent
burnt
who
was
with
me
and
we
photographed
the
remains”.
the
defendant
did
not
testify
nor
call
any
witnesses
but
he
did
make
an
argument
to
the
jury
at
--
during
which
he
stated,
and
this
is
on
page
29
of
the
record
and,
“i
don't
contest
the
fact
that
i
did
burn
my
draft
card
because
i
did”.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
after
a
careful
consideration
which
is
fully
disclosed
on
the
record,
judge
sweeney
sentenced
the
defendant
under
the
youth
correction
act.
in
the
defendant's
brief,
this
is
referred
to
as
a
six-year
maximum
indeterminate
sentence
and
in
a
very
real
sense
it
is.
but
it
is
also
quite
different
from
an
ordinary
sentence
because
it
can
be
much
shorter
than
the
maximum
and
it
can
be
terminated
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
the
defendant
with
no
criminal
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
was
19
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
when
the
offense
is
committed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21.
when
the
case
went
to
the
united
states'
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
that
court
in
an
opinion
by
judge
aldrich
held
that
the
1965
amendment
which
made
draft
card
burning
specifically
an
offense
was
unconstitutional
as
a
suppression
of
symbolic
speech.
having
reached
the
result
of
unconstitutionality
however,
judge
aldrich
then
exercised
the
certain
measure
of
what
might
be
called
yankee
ingenuity.
he
held
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
should
nevertheless
be
sustained
because
the
facts
necessarily
prove
to
support
the
draft
card
burning
charge
inevitably
clude
--
included
proof
of
a
related
offense,
namely,
not
being
in
possession
of
a
draft
card
as
required
by
the
selective
service
regulations
and
made
an
offense
under
paragraph
6
of
the
statute
to
which
i've
already
referred.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
judge
aldrich
said
it
was
an
included
offense.
i
would
support
the
result
on
a
slightly
different
verbal
formulation
that
it
was
an
offense
the
facts
of
which
were
proved
and
the
fact
that
the
government
appeared
to
proceed
under
a
different
clause
of
the
statute
didn't
negative
the
validity
of
the
conviction
when
the
facts
proved
showed
a
violation
of
section
6
even
though
section
3
was
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
question
with
respect
to
section
6
and
the
possession
offense
is
the
issue
in
number
233,
the
respondent's
petition.
i
would
prefer
to
deal
with
that
after
i've
dealt
with
the
constitution
argument
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
--
the
indictment
is
on
page
3
and
that
is
the
entire
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
your
honor.
from
this
result,
both
parties
sought
certiorari
and
the
grant
of
both
petitions
brings
the
case
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
insofar
as
–
are
you
talking
about
the
constitutional
argument
now,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
the
recent
case
which
is
closest
to
it
is
united
states
against
hutcheson
in
312
u.s.
where
the
court
said,
“in
order
to
determine
whether
an
indictment
charges
an
offense
against
the
united
states,
designated
by
the
pleader
of
the
statute
under
--
an
offense
designation
by
the
pleader
of
the
statute
under
which
he
purported,
delay
the
charge
is
immaterial.
he
may
have
conceived
the
charge
under
one
statute
which
would
not
sustain
the
indictment
but
it
may
nevertheless
come
within
the
terms
of
another
statute.
now,
here
it
is
not
really
another
statute,
it's
another
clause
of
the
same
statute
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
he
burned
his
draft
card
and
it
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
that
that
he
was
thereafter
not
in
possession
of
the
draft
card.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
you
get
to
only
if
you
decide
against
us
on
the
constitutional
issue
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
had
regarded
it
as
a
subordinate
issue
and
had
planned
to
deal
with
it
later.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
if
the
facts
which
were
required
to
prove
the
first
offense
were
also
facts
which
would
prove
the
second
offense.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position,
your
honor.
it
is
not
verbally
so
but
it
is
logical.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
make
the
same
argument
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
even
if
it
had
referred
to
section
3,
under
our
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
government
has
brought
an
indictment
under
one
section
of
the
revised
statutes
or
of
the
criminal
code
and
this
court
has
sustained
the
conviction
under
another
section
of
the
revised
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
charge
does
not
refer
to
the
section
at
all
and
it
is
all
under
the
same
section.
i
think
we
got
into
this
by
my
saying
that
though
judge
aldrich
had
recalled
it
a
lesser
included
offense,
i
did
not
regard
it
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
regarded
it
as
another
offense
under
the
same
section.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
certainly
is
the
primary
question
to
which
i
will
now
turn.
on
the
government's
petition,
no.
232,
there
is
only
a
question
of
constitutional
law.
there's
no
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute,
no
question
as
to
the
effect
or
the
weight
of
evidence.
the
facts
are
clear
and
as
i've
indicated
in
effect
admitted.
on
its
face,
there
can
be
no
constitutional
question
about
the
statute.
it
forbids
the
doing
of
an
act:
knowingly
destroys,
knowingly
mutilates.
the
contention
is
made,
however,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
act
constitutes
symbolic
speech
and
that
congress
cannot
proscribe
it
because
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment's
provision
of
laws
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
of
course,
it
is
clear
that
there
can
be
symbolic
speech
or
to
put
it
another
way
that
acts
may
be
in
effect
a
speech
though
they
are
not
vocal,
oral,
by
voice,
a
nod,
the
shake
of
the
head,
a
wink,
a
raising
of
an
eyebrow
at
an
auction
sale,
a
gesture
such
thumbs
down
may
be
modes
of
communication
and
one
can
readily
think
of
circumstances
under
which
congress
could
not
forbid
them
as
for
example
on
the
case
of
an
address
delivered
by
hand
signals
to
an
audience
of
deaf
persons.
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
all
acts
are
the
equivalent
of
speech
or
that
congress
cannot
forbid
them
even
though
there
is
an
element
of
communication
in
them.
i
suppose
that
assaulting
an
official
of
the
selective
service
system
could
be
thought
of
as
symbolic
speech
or
breaking
a
window
of
this
court
building
under
certain
circumstances.
in
a
sense,
refusing
to
report
for
induction
could
be
argued
to
be
symbolic
speech.
it
seems
equally
clear
that
all
of
these
acts
can
be
made
unlawful
by
congress.
in
an
effort
to
test
this
problem,
there
is
one
case
which
this
court
has
considered
which
i
think
is
entirely
out
of
the
emotional
zone
and
therefore
it
may
be
of
a
particular
use
in
considering
this
question.
this
is
people
against
stover
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief.
that
is
the
case
which
came
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
it
involved
a
married
couple
in
new
rochelle,
new
york
who
thought
their
taxes
were
too
high
and
so
they
strung
dirty
clothes
and
underwear
and
odds
and
ends
of
unattractive
things
on
a
clothesline
in
front
of
their
house
and
each
year
that
they
didn't
get
their
taxes
reduced,
they
put
up
another
clothesline
so
that
in
time,
they
had
six,
both
in
the
front
and
in
the
side
of
their
yard.
and
thereafter,
after
the
clothesline
were
up,
the
city
of
new
rochelle
passed
an
ordinance
making
it
illegal
to
have
clotheslines
on
the
front
or
side
of
a
house
abutting
the
street
with
certain
exceptions
in
cases
of
necessity
and
the
defendants
in
that
case
did
not
claim
the
necessity.
they
were
then
prosecuted
under
this
city
ordinance
and
were
convicted.
they
took
their
case
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
very
carefully
considered
in
an
opinion
by
then
judge
fuld,
who
considered
expressly
the
first
amendment
argument
that
this
putting
up
of
the
clothesline
was
symbolic
speech
intended
to
show
their
opposition
to
the
local
government
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
and
then
not
content
with
that,
the
parties
filed
an
appeal
to
this
court
and
in
375
u.s.,
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
see
that
that
--
no
i
find
nothing
of
aesthetic
about
this
case.
i
don't
see
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
see
that
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
issue
which
seems
to
me
to
--
be
the
one
in
which
in
that
case
is
parallel
with
what
is
here
which
is
whether
this
is
symbolic
speech.
and
if
it
is,
whether
it
can
be
proscribed
by
a
law
enacted
or
putting
it
another
way,
whether
that
law
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
which
is
of
course
is
binding
on
congress
in
which
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
equally
applicable
to
the
city
of
new
rochelle
in
that
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
don't
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
quality
but
we
do
maintain
that
there
was
a
valid
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
not
aesthetics
to
be
sure
but
one
related
to
the
effective
operation
of
the
selective
service
system,
which
is
within
the
power
expressly
granted
to
congress
to
reasons
support
armies
and
to
enact
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
out
the
foregoing
powers.
now
let
me
see
if
i
can
help
to
answer
your
question
by
turning
to
another
one
which
is
more
emotional
of
the
flag.
neither
side
here
has
made
much
reference
to
the
flag.
i
suppose
because
it
comes
close
to
the
line.
of
course,
the
flag
is
a
symbol
and
burning
or
defiling
a
flag
could
be
regarded
as
symbolic
speech.
as
things
have
developed
in
this
country,
legislation
with
respect
to
desecration
of
the
flag
has
been
almost
entirely
left
to
the
states.
nearly
every
state
has
such
a
statute.
the
only
act
of
congress
relates
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
applicable
to
anyone
who
shall
publicly
mutilate,
the
same
word
as
we
have
here,
deface,
defile
or
defy,
trample
upon
or
cast
contempt
either
by
word
or
action
upon
any
such
flag.
that's
title
iv
of
the
united
states
code,
section
3.
can
there
be
any
doubt
about
the
validity
of
such
a
statute?
i
would
have
thought
not
and
similar
legislation
has
been
applied
in
many
states
decisions.
of
course,
a
draft
card
is
not
a
flag.
nevertheless,
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
symbol
of
public
authority.
i
suppose
that
the
fact
that
it
is
such
a
symbol
as
what
makes
it
attracted
to
burning.
is
it
not
clear
that
maintaining
public
authority,
not
suppression
of
speech
but
simply
maintaining
public
authority,
is
a
proper
exercise
of
government
and
specifically
has
something
which
congress
could
properly
regard
as
necessary
and
proper
to
the
effective
exercise
of
its
undoubted
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
the
defendant
relies
extensively
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
amendment.
he
makes
extensive
arguments
about
the
difference
between
motive
behind
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
are,
i
regret
to
say,
too
elusive
for
me
to
comprehend.
even
on
the
defendant's
ground
though,
the
legislative
history
which
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
defendant's
brief,
seems
that
best
equivocal
to
me.
i
think
i
should
mention
that
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
which
the
defendants
sets
out,
and
i
only
became
aware
of
this
myself
yesterday
afternoon,
there
is
four
pages
of
what
i
suppose
technically
would
be
called
“hearing”
before
the
house
armed
services
committee
dated
august
6,
1965.
however,
when
this
is
examined,
it
is
not
a
hearing
in
the
usual
sense
and
that
there
were
no
outside
witnesses.
the
only
persons
who
participated
were
members
of
the
committee
and
that
does
affect
the
--
in
effect
the
proceedings
of
the
committee
at
the
time
that
they
adopted
the
report
which
was
presented
to
the
house.
only
three
members
of
both
houses
spoke
at
all,
two
congressmen
and
one
senator.
the
house
passed
the
bill
by
a
vote
of
393
to
1.
the
senate
passed
the
bill
by
a
voice
vote
without
a
roll
call.
there
were
two
committee
reports
by
the
two
armed
services
committee.
the
earlier
report
is
that
of
the
committee
of
the
house
and
it
states
that
the
states
--
the
purpose
of
the
bill
in
these
terms,
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
legislation
is
to
provide
a
clear
statutory
prohibition
against
the
person
knowingly
destroying
or
knowingly
mutilating
a
draft
registration
card.
and
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
said,
if
allowed
to
continue
unchecked,
referring
to
draft
card
burning,
this
contumacious
conduct
represents
a
potential
threat
to
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
and
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
that
is
true.
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
that
and
there
had
then
been
publicity
to
it,
that
might
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
impact
of
this
is
of
course,
in
its
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
says
nothing
about
that.
i
recognized
the
statute
was
of
course
enacted
to
meet
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
public
burning
of
draft
cards.
in
united
states
against
miller,
where
this
same
question
was
considered
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
its
cited
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
said
and
this
bears
on
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
proper
functioning
of
the
system
depends
upon
the
aggregated
consequences
of
individual
acts
in
raising
an
army
no
less
than
in
regulating
commerce.
the
seriousness
of
an
individual's
acts
must
often
be
assessed
not
only
in
isolation
but
under
the
assumption
that
they
may
be
multiplied
manifold.
therefore,
the
interest
to
be
served,
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
selective
system
is
furthered
by
the
statute
under
attack.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
certainly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
certainly
had
no
intention,
your
honor,
to
waive
or
to
ignore
the
other
line
of
argument
which
supports
the
statute.
it
is
dealt
with
at
length
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
in
united
states
against
miller.
particularly
at
the
bottom
of
page
80
and
81
of
that
opinion
where
a
considerable
number
of
ways
in
which
the
draft
card
can
be
useful
in
the
administration
of
the
system
are
set
forth.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
place
where
that
this
is
more
fully
or
comprehensively
stated
than
in
that
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
and
i
surely
intend
to
rely
on
it.
to
begin
with,
the
court
says
the
notice
of
classification
serves
as
proof
of
registration
and
it
also
contains
complete
information
as
to
a
registrant's
classification
including
the
type
and
date
thereof
and
the
period
for
which
it
is
effective.
thus
inability
to
produce
the
card
provides
an
easy
means
of
initially
detecting
those
attempting
to
evade
their
selective
service
obligations
and
this
goes
on
with
other
potential
users
of
a
draft
card
for
about
a
column
and
that
of
course,
i
intended
to
rely
on
them.perhaps,
it
was
because
i
was
trying
not
to
dodge
away
from
what
might
be
regarded
as
the
hard
part
of
the
argument
that
i
came
in
to
the
other
part
first.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
make
--
it
would
make
no
difference
whatever.
that
runs
into
another
problem
and
that
the
offense
then
isn't
essentially
different
from
not
being
in
possession
of
a
draft
card
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
moment.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
a
defendant's
brief;
that
this
statute
labors
under
some
sort
of
infirmity
because
congress
passed
it
on
its
own
initiative
and
without
any
prodding
from
the
selective
service
system
or
other
officers
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
this
seems
a
rather
noble
point
where
usually
told
that
the
executive
interferes
to
much
in
the
workings
of
the
congress.
that
congress
should
itself
determine
what
are
to
be
the
laws
of
the
lands
should
need
no
defense.
certainly,
it
is
not
a
basis
for
showing
that
the
statute
passed
by
congress
is
unconstitutional.
congress
did
not
forbid
dissent.
it
could
not
do
that.
o'brien
was
free
at
all
times
to
express
dissent
by
speech
from
the
courthouse
steps
or
on
the
street
corners,
by
letters
to
the
editor,
by
pamphlet,
by
radio
and
television.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
the
line
between
a
speech
and
no
speech
where
the
answer
would
be
clear
in
favor
of
speech.
for
the
contention
of
the
defendant
is
not
that
he
can
speak
which
of
course
he
can
but
rather
that
he
can
do
acts
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
been
forbidden
by
that
formal
action
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
congress
assembled
which
we
call
a
statute.
of
course,
a
statute
must
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
constitution.
this
one,
we
submit
does.
in
terms
it
forbids
an
act
clearly
and
specifically
so
that
there's
no
question
of
over
breadth
or
vagueness.
the
defendant
knew
exactly
what
was
forbidden
and
what
he
was
doing.
what
he
did
clearly
constituted
an
interference
with
the
effective
operation
of
the
selective
service
system
and
congress
as
the
legislative
arm
of
the
government,
acting
according
to
its
judgment
determined
that
this
should
be
unlawful.
since
there
was
no
real
impairment
of
any
right
to
speak
and
since
adequate
other
avenues
of
communication
were
always
open
to
the
defendant,
the
contention
of
the
defendants'
action
was
symbolic
speech
should
not
take
away
from
congress
the
power
to
do
what
it
regarded
as
necessary
and
proper
in
order
to
carry
out
its
power
granted
by
the
constitution
to
raise
and
support
armies.
as
this
court
said
in
the
giboney
against
the
empire
storage
company
case,
it
is
never
been
deemed
an
abridgment
of
freedom
of
speech
suppressed
to
make
a
course
of
conduct
illegal
merely
because
the
conduct
was
in
part
initiated,
evidenced
or
carried
out
by
means
of
language
either
spoken,
written
or
printed.
one
other
point
is
made
by
the
defendant.
he
says
that
since
non-possession
of
a
draft
card
was
already
forbidden,
it
follows
that
when
congress
forbad
draft
card
burning,
the
only
purpose
in
effect
to
the
statute
was
to
abridge
symbolic
speech.
it
is
true
that
congress
from
the
beginning
of
the
draft
laws
and
specifically
in
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
passed
in
1948
has
made
it
a
crime
knowingly
to
violate
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
under
the
statute
relating
to
the
issuance,
transfer
or
possession
of
certificates
under
the
draft
law.
either
or
both
the
registration
certification
and
the
classification
certificate
are
generally
lumped
together
in
the
term
“draft
cards”.
regulations
under
the
act
have
long
provided
that
a
registrant
must
have
in
his
personal
possession
at
all
times
his
registration
certificate
and
his
notice
of
classification
if
he
has
been
classified.
again,
it
is
odd
that
congress
should
be
regarded
as
under
a
disability
because
it
has
shown
to
--
chosen
to
put
into
a
statute
something
which
is
closely
related
to
a
regulation.
some
might
think
it
better
for
the
law
to
be
stated
in
what
congress
has
itself
written
rather
than
by
delegated
executive
action.
moreover,
the
regulation
could
be
changed
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
might
be
subject
to
attack
on
grounds
of
construction,
or
vagueness,
or
a
lack
of
validly
delegated
authority.
the
statute
is
clear
and
specific
and
subject
to
change
only
by
congress.
it
should
surely
spend
no
lower
constitutionally
or
otherwise
because
it
was
preceded
and
is
today
accompanied
by
a
closely
related
regulation.
the
statutes
on
the
regulation
are
not
coextensive.
the
regulation
deals
with
what
might
be
called
a
status
of
non-possession.
it
might
apply,
for
example
to
a
man
who
lost
his
draft
card
and
then
deliberately
and
willfully
did
not
seek
a
replacement
while
the
statute
pinpoints
a
particular
act,
which
results
in
loss
of
possession.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
is
constitutional.application
of
the
statute
does
not
hinder
protected
methods
of
protest.
on
its
face,
the
law
forbids
an
act
and
represents
a
reasonable
judgment
by
congress,
that
one
who
either
knowingly
destroys
or
knowingly
mutilates
a
draft
card
does
an
act
which
impairs
the
effective
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system.
that
legislative
determination,
we
submit,
should
be
deemed
to
fall
within
the
bounds
of
congressional
power.
i
now
turn
to
the
question
raised
in
number
233,
which
is
the
defendant's
position
as
i've
already
pointed
out
it
need
not
be
reached
if
our
contention
as
to
constitutionality
is
maintained.
this
is
a
question
whether
the
conviction
can
be
sustained
even
though
the
amendment
to
clause
3
of
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it
amounts
to
a
charge
of
a
non-possession.
as
i've
said,
judge
aldrich
said
that
this
was
a
lesser
included
offense,
we
would
differ
verbally
with
this
and
the
offense
of
non-possession
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
it's
an
offense
under
the
same
section
of
the
statute
and
subject
to
the
same
penalty.
we
would
suggest
the
conclusion,
we
would
support
the
conclusion
of
the
judge
on
the
ground
that
the
facts
alleged
were
sufficient
to
embrace
the
offense
of
non-possession;
that
the
facts
proved
clearly
showed
non-possession
and
that
there
is
no
unfairness
to
the
defendant
in
this
as
he
was
in
no
sense
taken
by
surprise.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we
at
least,
your
honor,
we
have
sought
to
distinguish
cole
against
arkansas
on
pages
34
and
35
of
our
brief.
there,
there
was
a
real
shift
so
that
the
defendant
was
taken
by
surprise
and
there
was
a
clear
element
of
unfairness.
we
think
that
there
is
no
unfairness
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
at
all
--
your
honor,
i
beg
not
a
totally
different
act,
the
very
same
section
of
the
same
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
different
clause
of
the
same
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
logically
embraces
the
fact
of
non-possession.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
they
were
substantially
different,
i
would
agree
on
you
with
this.
i
think
our
case
on
this
point
turns
on
the
fact
that
as
we
see
it
there
is
no
substantial
difference
when
you
get
right
down
to
what's
involved.
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
defense
was
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
filed
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
had
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
the
jury
was
called
on
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
think
judge
sweeney
passed
on
that
by
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
jury
simply
decided
to
question
the
fact
whether
he
did
burned
his
draft
card,
which,
i
repeat,
logically
requires
a
conclusion
that
he
was
there
after
not
in
possession
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
would've
been
exactly
the
same
on
the
charged
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
right.
defendant
makes
several
closely
related
points
at
the
end
of
his
brief.
he
contends
that
the
sentence
was
so
excessive
as
to
constitute
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
he
further
objects
to
the
words
or
conduct
of
the
district
judge.
with
respect
to
this,
it
should
be
observed
that
they
were
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
those
are
not
before
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
court,
the
entire
proceedings
on
the
sentence
are
on
the
record.
when
this
court
reads
this
portion
of
the
record,
it
will
see
i
think
the
concern
of
the
judge
about
this
difficult
case
and
the
care
that
he
took
in
the
performance
of
the
duty
which
was
his.
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
in
the
same,
(inaudible)
the
same
words.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
penalty
is
entirely
on
the
final
clause
of
this
section
which
has
six
clauses.
clause
3
is
the
one
in
which
the
knowingly
burns,
knowingly
mutilates
was
inserted
and
clause
6
is
the
one
that
deals
with
violation
of
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
something
i
believe
that
judge
aldrich
set
up
on
his
own.
i
don't
believe
this
was
argued
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government's
position
there
was
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
they
tried
to
put
a
second
line
of
defense
at
that
point.
whatever
feelings
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
on
limitations.
i
believe
it
is
six
years
under
the
selective
service
act
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i
simply
am
not
informed
as
to
what
the
statute
of
limitations
if
--
whether
there
is
special
one
for
this
or
whether
it
comes
under
the
general
act.
whatever
feelings
of
compassion
or
regret
one
may
have
for
the
defendant
in
his
situation,
it's
clear
that
he
violated
the
law.
we
submit
that
the
law
was
validly
made
and
that
it
is
not
fairly
to
be
regarded
as
an
abridgment
of
freedom
of
speech
when
it
does
not
involve
speech
in
anyway
and
when
all
avenues
of
speech
remain
open
to
the
defendant.
congress
could
conclude
that
the
law
it
passed
bears
a
proper
relation
to
the
maintenance
of
effective
self-government.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
should
be
reversed.
