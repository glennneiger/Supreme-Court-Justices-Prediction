mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
presentation
of
factual
background
by
the
solicitor
general,
insofar
as
concerns
the
facts
both
of
the
petitioner
of
the
cross-petition,
there
is
very
little
that
need
be
added
insofar
as
concerns
such
factual
background.
however,
i
believe
a
few
factual
type
observations
are
appropriate
and
are
borne
out
not
only
by
the
reading
of
the
record
but
by
the
solicitor
general's
presentation
to
this
court.
first,
i
believe
it
is
clear,
particularly
from
the
passage
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
that
the
verbal
conduct
or
symbolic
act
or
whatever
words
one
chooses
to
use
on
the
part
of
david
o'brien
were
intended
as
an
act
of
dissent.
as
an
act
of
expression
of
dissent,
the
government
foreign
policy,
the
government
military
policy
to
the
war
in
vietnam
and
to
drafting
of
young
men
to
serve
in
that
war.
i
think
it
must
also
be
conceded
that
this
symbolic
speech
or
verbal
conduct
on
o'brien's
part
attracted
attention,
attracted
the
attention
of
media,
attracted
the
attention
of
media
audiences,
attracted
the
attention
of
a
hostile
crowd
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we're
talking
about
the
act
of
public
demonstration
on
the
part
of
o'brien
in
publicly
setting
fire
to
his
selective
service
certificate
under
the
circumstances
under
which
he
did
it.
i
used
the
word
verbal
conduct
synonymously
with
symbolic
speech
and
i
believe
that
there
may
be
some
cases
which
support
it
but
i
won't
press
that
point.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
that
some
of
the
same
questions
would
be
involved.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
some
of
the
first
amendment
questions
would
be
involved
but
not
others.
the
question,
which
i
believe
is
a
very
serious
one
in
this
case,
and
that
is
our
argument
that
there
was
a
clear
and
unequivocal
manifestation
of
improper
congressional
purpose
would
not
exists
in
a
non-possession
prosecution.
consequently,
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
non-possession
if
it
decides
the
case
in
a
manner
on
which
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
decided.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
be
urging
the
--
that
we
would
be
urging
the
first
amendment
arguments
if
the
symbolic
act
had
the
same
manifestation
and
the
same
purpose.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor,
we
are
because
we
believe
that
this
brings
it
close
to
the
line
of
symbolic
speech
cases
which
have
been
decided
(voice
overlap)
this
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
factor
would
be
much
less,
your
honor,
and
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
make
an
argument
of
symbolic
speech
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
it
requires
an
act
of
communication
i
believe.
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
meadowmoor
case
who
talked
about
free
speech
in
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
rational
modes
of
communicating
ideas.
and
i
suppose
that
that'd
be
communication,
it
has
to
be
transmission
and
reception.
and
transmission
and
reception
occurs
when
there
are
transmitters
and
receivers.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
it
probably
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
that's
why
i
started
in
response
to
this
colloquy
your
honor,
that
i
would
hope
that
we
would
not
have
to
argue
this
question
here.
this
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
non-possession.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
or
wouldn't
be
symbolic
speech
but
we
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
we
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
certainly
do
not
argue.
as
the
government
in
its
brief
suggests
that
under
our
theory,
anything
which
communicates
is
protected
and
that
anything
which
communicates
an
idea
is
protected.
we
don't
argue
that
the
dumping
of
garbage
is
protected
or
that
political
assassination
is
protected
or
that
any
other
of
the
fanciful
notions
which
the
government
seeks
to
charges
with
is
protected.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
would
like
to
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
lines
should
be
drawn
in
accordance
with
the
proper
application
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
however,
we
feel
that
even
if
the
court
would
choose
to
apply
the
ad
hoc
balancing
test
that
the
various
values
which
are
placed
on
the
balance
on
both
sides
are
such
so
that
the
statute
cannot
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
if
i
would
defend
it,
mr.
justice
fortas
on
the
basis
that
you
used
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
but
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
much
easier
to
show
a
valid
governmental
purpose
for
the
requirement
that
income
tax
records
be
preserved
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
that
it
is
for
the
requirement
that
a
person
have
in
his
possession
or
that
a
person
be
enjoined
from
mutilating
or
destroying
the
selective
service
certificate.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
would
think
that
these
are
items
which
can
properly
be
weighed
in
the
judicial
constitutional
balance.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
let
me
address
myself
at
this
point
then,
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
various
suggestions
which
have
been
made
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
this
court
and
in
other
courts
and
by
the
learned
solicitor
general
that
this
is
a
proper
indication
of
the
power
to
raise
armies
because
it
serves
some
role
in
the
selective
service
--
in
the
administration
of
selective
service.
now
i
believe
i
count
to
three
or
four
occasions
when
the
solicitor
general
repeated
that
this
serves
a
valid
selective
service
--
a
valid
function
but
all
that
he
stated
was
referring
to
the
second
circuit's
opinion.
now,
i
believe
that
if
we
outlined
all
of
the
rationales
which
are
presented
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
as
well
as
those
in
the
brief
presented
by
the
government,
we
are
left
with
no
more
than
the
possibility
that
the
certificate
may
serve
some
notice
giving
or
identification
purpose
exclusively
for
the
benefit
of
the
registrant
himself.
and
that
only
under
the
most
remote
possible
conditions
can
it
be
suggested
that
it
serves
some
function
for
the
government.
it
is
well-known
that
the
selective
service
system
keeps
elaborate
records
at
its
national
headquarters
and
emergency
records
of
other
kinds
as
well.
now,
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
reason
why
the
solicitor
general
was
not
more
explicit
in
stating
these
reasons
is
that
some
of
them
are
so
fanciful
as
perhaps
not
to
be
worthy
of
mention
in
this
court.
and
i
noticed
that
two
of
those
which
have
been
suggested
in
the
lower
courts
have
not
been
suggested
in
this
court,
namely
that
in
the
even
of
an
earthquake,
disaster
or
other
flood
why
--
or
something
of
a
nature
of
a
flood,
it
would
be
possible
for
--
there'd
be
a
quick
reconstruction
of
the
records
if
all
men
would
be
ordered
to
report
to
a
certain
place
by
radio
or
television.
and
the
final
suggestion
which
was
made
in
the
arguments
below
but
thankfully
not
in
this
court
was
that
in
the
even
of
an
enemy
missile
attack
and
a
call
by
radio
why
persons
could
be
ordered
to
report
to
certain
places
in
accordance
with
their
draft
classifications
and
that
would
serve
a
valid
governmental
purpose.
the
only
other
purpose,
which
it
was
suggested
is
served
is
that
when
the
registrant
to
his
local
board,
in
the
event
he
may
have
forgotten
his
number
or
forgotten
the
address
of
his
board
while
it
may
assist
in
this
identification
if
he
has
the
card
in
his
possession.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
all
that
the
government
can
offer
in
support
of
this,
it
is
a
very,
very
light
balance
indeed.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
enforcement
of
what
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
seems
there,
does
not
seem
to
be
--
it
does
not
seem
to
play
any
role
in
the
enforcement
of
the
selective
service
laws.
no
mention
of
it
can
be
found
in
any
of
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
material
which
selective
service
is
published
and
the
selective
service
system
has
been
administering
the
selective
service
laws
in
1940.
i
think
it
is
most
surprising
indeed
that
not
only
was
no
selective
service
testimony
presented
to
congress
but
at
anytime,
in
the
course
of
all
of
this
litigation
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
appellate
courts,
able
attorneys
for
the
government
have
not
been
able
to
come
forward
with
even
a
single
statement
on
the
part
of
any
selective
service
official
or
defense
department
official
or
governmental
official
showing
that
this
serves
any
purpose
at
all.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
of
course,
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
it's
not
that
purpose
served
at
the
time
that
it's
received.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
reason
is
to
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
two
certificates,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there's
a
registration
certificate
and
a
notice
of
classification.
the
registration
certificate
is
permanent.
the
notice
of
classification
changes
with
its
classification
as
a
means
of
notifying
the
registrant
of
classification.
and
certainly
upon
receipt,
it's
serves
that
notice
purpose.
but
that
is
a
purpose
presumably
for
the
benefit
of
the
registrant
which
we
would
argue
the
registrant
can
waive.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
of
states,
it
is
common
knowledge
that
it
serves
many
purposes.
if
one
has
to
look
for
common
knowledge,
the
common
knowledge
which
most
people
know
that
selective
service
certificates
serve
is
that
it
helps
to
identify
a
registrant
as
being
18
years
of
age,
in
a
state
where
18
years
old
are
allowed
to
purchase
alcoholic
beverages.
that's
the
only
common
knowledge
with
regards
to
selective
service
certificates.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
perhaps,
some
are
interested
in
other
types
of
sustenance,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
can't
see,
mr.
justice
brennan,
how
that's
serves
a
governmental
purpose.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
if
it
tells
you
--
if
a
piece
of
paper
tells
you
of
the
date
of
your
birth,
i
can't
see
what
other
purpose
it
serves
other
than
to
allow
you
to
present
some
proof
as
to
your
date
of
birth.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
has
this
knowledge.
the
government
has
this
knowledge
at
the
time
the
young
men
registers
and
the
government
has
many,
many
sources
for
obtaining
this
information.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
is
any
dereliction
or
delinquency
or
violation
of
the
selective
service
statute,
the
position
or
retention
or
non-possession
or
non-retention
of
this
card
will
have
no
effect
on
the
government's
ability
to
prosecute.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
must
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suppose
that
one
could
question
whether
or
not
any
problem
of
self-incrimination
might
be
raised
by
someone
being
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
know
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
are
not
making
any
such
argument,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
an
argument
which
--
but,
i
do
wish
to
repeat
that
david
o'brien
was
neither
indicted,
nor
tried
nor
convicted
for
non-possession.
he
was
indicted
and
tried
and
convicted
for
burning,
for
violating
the
1965
amendment.
that
is
the
only
question
we
respectfully
submit
before
this
court.
and
there
is
a
special
area
of
constitutional
questions
which
are
--
which
arise
because
of
the
manner
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
with
respect
believe
that
this
can
be
avoided
notwithstanding
the
suggestion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
distinction
between
congressional
motive
and
congressional
purpose
is
illusive
to
the
government.
i
believe
that
the
entire
legislative
history,
which
we
have
set
forth
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
we've
done
this
deliberately
because
we
don't
wish
to
be
open
to
this
suggestion
that
we
are
picking
and
choosing,
demonstrates
beyond
any
question
that
the
only
congressional
purpose
here
was
the
purpose
of
stamping
out
dissent,
of
stamping
out
this
particular
form
and
expression
of
dissent.
the
government
indeed
so
acknowledged
it
and
the
solicitor
general
acknowledged
it
in
part
of
his
argument.
the
government
was
seeking
to
punish
contumacious
conduct.
the
government
acknowledges
that
--
it
says
that
perhaps
some
of
the
purposes
will
less
constitutionally
justify
than
others.
the
government
acknowledges
that
at
least
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
declare
draft
card
burning
insulting
and
unpatriotic.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
congress
to
declare
it
a
felony
which
could
send
the
young
man
to
jail
for
five
years
because
congress
believes
his
conduct
to
be
insulting
and
unpatriotic.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
quite
something
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
quite
so,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
argument
directed
at
the
unconstitutional
purpose
and
the
manifestation
of
unconstitutional
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
congress
would
be
the
same,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
perhaps,
i
did
not
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
where
there
is
such
an
extensive
degree
of
congressional
excess,
unconstitutional
excess
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
the
act
which
was
passed
as
a
result
of
it
is
on
its
face
unconstitutional.
congress
could
not
have
declared
it
to
be
a
crime
for
someone
to
stand
up
and
say,
“this
selective
certificate
in
my
hand,
i
detest
it
and
everything
for
which
it
stands".
no
more
can
congress
declare
it
a
crime
or
someone
who,
at
the
time
that
he
sets
it
and
sets
fire
to
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
may
i
first,
with
respect,
mr.
justice
fortas
comment
on
your
terminology.
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
distinguished
between
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
let
me
correct
my
own
then,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
distinction
which
we
are
urging
upon
this
court
and
which
has
been
utilized
by
courts
of
appeals,
but
i
must
admit
not
yet
directly
and
explicitly
by
this
court,
is
between
a
--
is
between
that
which
is
called
“motivation”
which
is
the
unrevealed
reason
why
a
member
of
a
legislature
cast
or
doesn't
cast
a
vote.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
do
believe
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
i
do
have
authority
which
points
strongly
in
that
direction,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
refer
to
the
case
of
grosjean
against
the
american
press
company
and
the
case
of
gomillion
against
lighfoot,
the
tuskegee
racial
gerrymandering
case.
i
believe
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
went
very
close,
came
very
close
to
it
stating
that
where
the
legislative
purpose
is
manifestly
improper,
the
court
is
not
obliged
to
look
any
further.
i
believe
that
grosjean
perhaps
even
more
strongly
than
the
other
one.
however,
i
do
respectfully
commend
to
the
court
the
distinctions
which
were
most
explicitly
stated
by
circuit
judge
sofaer
in
the
in
the
petty
case
on
page
24
of
our
brief
and
by
circuit
judge
brown
in
the
gomillion
case
before
it
came
to
this
court
on
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
and
in
both
of
these
cases,
i
believe
that
these
distinguished
members
of
the
fifth
circuit
indicated
that
--
forgive
me,
legislative
motive,
good
or
bad,
is
irrelevant
to
the
process
of
judicial
review
but
legislative
purpose
is
of
primary
importance
in
determining
the
propriety
of
legislative
action
since
the
purpose
itself
must
be
within
the
legislative
competence
and
the
method
used
must
be
reasonably
widely
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
again,
what
the
legislature
of
alabama
as
distinguished
from
its
members
intended
on
this
court
and
what
the
purpose
on
this
court
of
the
legislature
as
distinguished
from
its
members
was
in
the
enactment
of
this
law
is
that
a
traditional
matter
well
concern
to
the
judiciary.
now,
the
best
cases
that
i
can
cite,
decisions
by
this
court
is
the
case
of
grosjean
and
the
case
of
gomillion.
now
in
grosjean,
mr.
justice
sutherland
writing
for
the
court
spoke
of
two
things.
he
spoke
both
of
the
history
of
this
type
of
legislation.
this
if
i
may
refresh
the
recollection
of
all
of
us
was
the
newspaper
tax
law
enacted
by
the
huey
long
administration
in
the
state
of
louisiana
in
the
30's
which
had
the
clear
effect
of
discriminating
against
the
large
city
newspapers
in
favor
of
the
smaller
rural
newspapers
with
obvious
political
consequences.
and,
mr.
justice
sutherland
spoke
both
of
the
history
of
this
type
of
legislation
and
also
the
setting
in
which
it
was
passed.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
court
looked
at
the
setting
in
1930
in
the
grosjean
case.
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
the
setting
in
which
some
of
these
statutes
were
passed
in
the
petty
case
and
then
in
the
gomillion
case
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
should
not
be
and
will
not
be,
as
mr.
chief
justice
taft
observed
in
another
context,
too
blind
to
see
what
all
others
can
see.
the
setting
and
the
purpose
of
this
law,
when
it
was
passed
by
congress
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
it
had
only
one
purpose
in
mind.
nobody
was
concerned
with
anything
else.
all
of
that
is
subsequent
rationalizations,
subsequent
papering
is
over
by
able
attorneys
for
the
government
at
various
levels.
the
first
circuit
saw
that
there
was
no
rationale
legislative
purpose.
they
cited
grosjean
and
gomillion
but
they
didn't
comment
on
it.
they
say,
“we
won't
comment
on
the
purpose
on
whether
it
was
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
we
won't
say
whether
it
was
illegitimate
because
we
find
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose”.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
the
entire
reading
of
the
entire
legislative
history
would
make
this
clear.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
that
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
and
i
say
this
to
someone
who
has
a
deep
respect
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
have
a
number
of
personal
friends
who
were
in
congress.
i
think
that
the
congressional
action
in
this
case
was
an
act
of
hysteria
rather
than
act
of
reflection
and
there
was
a
desire
to
do
something
real
fast
to
punish
what
they
re
--
considered
to
be
unpatriotic.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
all
that
i
can
do,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
to
respectfully
repeat
that
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
look
into
the
motives
of
the
393
persons
who
voted
for
it.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
look
at
the
two-committee
chairman,
who
were
two
of
the
three
people
to
spoke
and
that
the
only
person
who
spoke,
the
authoritative
spokesman.
now,
a
learned
solicitor
general
points
out
that
only
three
spoke
but
in
fact,
this
straightens
the
argument
because
it
would
be
otherwise
perhaps
if
they
were
some
distinction
or
some
mixture
in
the
legislative
history,
some
non-unanimity.
but
here,
it's
unanimity.
all
three
who
spoke,
spoke
for
one
purpose.
we
have
to
do
this
to
support
our
voice.
we
have
to
do
this
to
punish
these
beatnik
kids.
that
is
the
gist
of
it.
i
am
not
quoting
out
of
context
that
can
be
easily
read
and
seen.
now,
if
there
was
ever
a
case,
where
it
was
appropriate,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
to
follow
the
precedent
which
it
reached
in
the
grosjean
case
and
the
suggestions
made
in
those
fifth
circuit
cases
which
i
cited.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
shall
i
continue,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
thank
you.
i
believe
that
it's
important
to
consider
the
--
not
the
cases
which
this
court
has
not
decided,
which
the
learned
solicitor
general
has
referred
to,
the
stover
case
in
new
york
or
the
flag
burning
case
which
has
not
yet
come
to
this
court
but
cases
which
this
court
has
actually
decided
and
where
this
court
has
developed
and
utilized
and
applied
the
doctrine
of
symbolic
speech.
the
two
chief
cases,
of
course,
are
the
red
flag
case,
stromberg
against
california
and
the
flag
salute
case,
was
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette.
now,
these
cases
are
cited,
passages
are
quoted
in
our
brief.
but
it
is
very
clear
from
these
cases
and
from
later
gloss,
which
this
court
has
put
on
it
that
abstract
discussion
is
not
the
only
the
form
of
speech
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
that
it
does
refer
to
certain
types
of
action.
and
to
put
it
another
way,
that
the
only
type
of
action
which
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
is
not
limited
to
the
movement
of
the
vocal
chords
that
it
protects
other
kinds
of
action
as
well.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
meadowmoor
case
which
pointed
out
that
certain
types
of
labor
activity
could
not
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
sir.
no
wagon
drivers
union
against
meadowmoor
dairies,
the
courts
--
according
to
my
brief,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
and
i'm
embarrassed
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
embarrassed
and
may
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
(inaudible).
it's
probably
an
oversight
in
the
editing
of
brief.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
language,
which
i'm
suggesting
and
which
carries
full
with
the
rationale
of
symbolic
speech
is
that
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
--
back
of
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
lay
faith
on
the
power
of
an
appeal
to
reason
by
all
of
the
peaceful
means
for
gaining
access
to
the
mind.
it
was
an
order
to
avert
force
and
explosions
due
to
restrictions
upon
rationale
modes
of
communication
that
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
was
given
so
generous
in
the
scope.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
it
would
have
to
be
tested
against
one
of
the
constitutional
test
which
was
applied
by
this
court
in
first
amendment
cases
out
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
or
the
balancing
test.
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
under
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
turn
to
a
different
case.
i
think
the
doctrine
and
notion
of
symbolic
speech
received
further
development
by
mr.
justice
harlan
of
this
court
and
what
i'm
sure
was
the
concurring
opinion,
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
garner
against
louisiana.
and
by
mr.
justice
fortas
of
this
court
in
what
was
called
the
prevailing
opinion
in
brown
against
louisiana.
in
both
of
which,
i
believe
that
the
notion
that
speech
means
more
than
just
a
movement
of
the
vocal
chords
was
developed.
in
various
cases
and
also
in
the
learned
article
by
professor
kelvin,
various
shorthand
expressions
have
been
used
to
describe
it.
the
working
man's
commute
--
means
of
communication
has
been
used
to
describe
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
very
true.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
precisely
the
problem,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
are
suggesting
that
this
comes
within
the
classical
doctrines
of
symbolic
speech
that
it
meets
the
criteria
of
symbolic
speech
which
this
court
has
announced.
it
has
all
the
whole
(inaudible)
of
it,
the
principle
one
of
which
is
had
it
as
peaceful
and
it
is
non-violent.
and
indeed,
distinctions
could
be
made
to
show
that
the
peaceful
ritual
like
act
of
setting
fire
to
a
piece
of
paper
as
part
of
a
demonstration
against
the
government
policy
which
this
piece
of
paper
represents
is
much
more
within
the
ambit
of
symbolic
speech
than
some
of
the
other
cases
where
it
has
been
applied.
there's
no
concerted
action
here.
no
action
of
large
numbers
of
persons
moving
their
bodies
in
any
direction
either
on
a
picket
line
or
in
a
radical
march
which
was
the
case
in
this
stromberg
case.
there
is
no
large
numbers
of
persons
going
into
a
place
of
private
property
as
in
the
lunch
counter
in
the
garner
case
or
into
a
public
place
like
the
library
in
brown
against
louisiana.
this
was
an
individual
act
of
a
single
person.
the
first
circuit
observed
that
there
was
no
active
incitement
or
agitation
of
others
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
a
case
could
not
come
within
this
court's
doctrine
of
symbolic
speech
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
i
must
respectfully
insist,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
recognize
the
unconstitutional
congressional
purpose,
then
it
need
not
go
into
such
a
careful
analysis
of
which
side
of
the
line
it
would
go.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
don't
say
that
at
all.
but
this
factor
is
so
clearly
and
inescapably
indicates
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
just
calls
for
consideration
by
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
the
court
can
reach
the
solution
which
i
respectfully
urge
upon
it
on
grounds
similar
to
those
found
by
the
first
circuit
which
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
grounds
are
that
regardless
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
statute
was
introduced
and
passed,
that
the
act
which
it
seeks
to
punish
is
an
act
of
symbolic
speech
within
the
traditional
decisions
of
this
court
recognizing
symbolic
speech.
that
it
is
as
much
if
not
more
symbolic
speech
than
peaceful
picketing,
than
a
peaceful
sit-in,
than
a
peaceful
stand-up
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
if
i
may
elaborate
on
it,
i
would
state
that
it's
certainly
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
being
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
any
--
to
the
accomplishment
of
any
substantive
congressional
purpose
and
i
would
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
can
be
decided
under
the
balancing
test
or
any
other
test
which
this
court
would
care
to
fashion
or
apply.
but
i
must
suggest
that
in
every
other
case
where
this
court
has
applied
symbolic
speech,
arguments
have
been
used
to
defend
the
statutes
saying
that
this
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
the
very
red
flag
law,
which
this
court
declared
unconstitutional
in
stromberg,
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
said
it's
of
proper
governmental
purpose
to
ban
red
flags
because
they
incite
people
to
riot.
we
cite
that
case
in
our
brief.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
passed
the
same
thing
and
that
congress
declares
that
it's
to
have
a
proper
--
that
it
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
members
of
congress,
it
has
a
proper
congressional
purpose
is
not
sufficient.
i
suggest
that
it's
incumbent
upon
this
court,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
incumbent
upon
this
court
when
a
constitutional
attack
is
made
and
when
something
at
least
appears
to
have
some
kind
of
effect
on
a
first
amendment
right
to
apply
one
of
the
constitutional
test
which
has
traditionally
been
applied.
i
think
it
should
also
be
mentioned
that
this
might
be
one
of
those
areas
where
there
is
a
mixture,
a
melding,
a
hybrid,
which
is
the
language
which
was
used
in
some
of
the
picketing
cases,
i
believe
of
where
there
is
speech
and
mixed
with
action.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
douglas
has
used
the
phrase
--
speech,
“brigaded
to
action”.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
analyze
what
is
it
that
the
statute
seeks
to
reach.
does
the
status
seek
to
reach
the
action
or
does
the
statute
seek
to
reach
the
speech?
i
suggest
that
not
only
the
legislative
history
but
the
--
but
just
the
plain
examination
of
what
the
statute
seeks
to
do
shows
that
it
seeks
to
reach
the
speech
because
as
the
first
circuit
pointed
out,
it
was
previously
in
existence,
a
regulation
with
the
same
penalty
which
would
presumably
reach
the
action.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
believe
that
chief
judge
aldrich
of
the
first
circuit
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
i
come
to
that
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
there
was
already
in
existence
a
regulation
seeking
to
punish
non-possession
--
the
non-possession
of
these
pieces
of
paper
and
that
consequently
that
it
does
not
appear
to
be
any
other
purpose
which
was
served
by
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
suppose
all
that
i
can
do
here,
mr.
justice
black,
is
to
refer
to
the
same
type
of
argument
which
might
have
been
advanced
in
support
of
the
spate
of
red
flag
laws,
which
were
enacted
by
state
legislatures
in
the
1920's
and
everybody
thought
that
they
were
reasonable
laws.
and
state
supreme
courts
held
that
they
were
constitutional.
that
they
were
valid
means
whereby
state
legislatures
could
seek
to
control
the
dangers
of
incipient
radical
movements
and
of
agitation
caused
by
radical
movements
and
riots
and
violence
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
that
with
respect
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
would
say
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
say
that
there
is
perhaps
a
greater
legislative
power
to
regulate
where
there
is
an
element
of
conduct
involved
than
there
is
in
a
case
where
there
is
pure
speech.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
writing
for
the
court
in
coax
against
louisiana.
we
don't
challenge
that
there
is
greater
regulatory
power
where
there
is
conduct
brigaded
to
the
speech
but
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
that's
one
of
the
arguments
which
we
make
in
the
alternative,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
was
going
to
cite
that,
mr.
justice
stewart
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
court,
refer
the
court
now
that
the
red
light
has
gone
on
that
a
case
companion
to
thornhill,
the
carlson
case
actually
brings
the
language
of
symbolic
speech
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
into
peaceful
picketing.
if
i
can
just
say
in
summation,
i
have
a
last
--
not
been
able
to
reach
other
points
which
i
hoped
i
will
have
enough
opportunity
to
reach
that
--
just
as
decisions
of
this
court
have
referred
to
peaceful
picketing
as
the
workingman's
means
of
communication
and
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
if
it
was
the
swing
case,
mr.
justice
black
or
if
it
was
the
thornhill-carlson
cases.
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
dispute
that
without
actually
having
the
books
in
front
of
me.
and
just
as
the
sit-in
has
been
called
the
poor
man's
printing
press,
i
would
like
tor
respectfully
suggest
that
perhaps
the
act
of
an
unknown,
obscure
pacifist,
who
wants
to
engage
in
the
dramatic
anti-war
act
of
burning
his
draft
card
makes
draft
card
burning
the
war
protestor's
tv
transmitter.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
light
of
the
presentation
of
factual
background
by
the
solicitor
general,
insofar
as
concerns
the
facts
both
of
the
petitioner
of
the
cross-petition,
there
is
very
little
that
need
be
added
insofar
as
concerns
such
factual
background.
however,
i
believe
a
few
factual
type
observations
are
appropriate
and
are
borne
out
not
only
by
the
reading
of
the
record
but
by
the
solicitor
general's
presentation
to
this
court.
first,
i
believe
it
is
clear,
particularly
from
the
passage
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
that
the
verbal
conduct
or
symbolic
act
or
whatever
words
one
chooses
to
use
on
the
part
of
david
o'brien
were
intended
as
an
act
of
dissent.
as
an
act
of
expression
of
dissent,
the
government
foreign
policy,
the
government
military
policy
to
the
war
in
vietnam
and
to
drafting
of
young
men
to
serve
in
that
war.
i
think
it
must
also
be
conceded
that
this
symbolic
speech
or
verbal
conduct
on
o'brien's
part
attracted
attention,
attracted
the
attention
of
media,
attracted
the
attention
of
media
audiences,
attracted
the
attention
of
a
hostile
crowd
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we're
talking
about
the
act
of
public
demonstration
on
the
part
of
o'brien
in
publicly
setting
fire
to
his
selective
service
certificate
under
the
circumstances
under
which
he
did
it.
i
used
the
word
verbal
conduct
synonymously
with
symbolic
speech
and
i
believe
that
there
may
be
some
cases
which
support
it
but
i
won't
press
that
point.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
that
some
of
the
same
questions
would
be
involved.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
some
of
the
first
amendment
questions
would
be
involved
but
not
others.
the
question,
which
i
believe
is
a
very
serious
one
in
this
case,
and
that
is
our
argument
that
there
was
a
clear
and
unequivocal
manifestation
of
improper
congressional
purpose
would
not
exists
in
a
non-possession
prosecution.
consequently,
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
non-possession
if
it
decides
the
case
in
a
manner
on
which
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
decided.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
be
urging
the
--
that
we
would
be
urging
the
first
amendment
arguments
if
the
symbolic
act
had
the
same
manifestation
and
the
same
purpose.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor,
we
are
because
we
believe
that
this
brings
it
close
to
the
line
of
symbolic
speech
cases
which
have
been
decided
(voice
overlap)
this
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
factor
would
be
much
less,
your
honor,
and
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
make
an
argument
of
symbolic
speech
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
it
requires
an
act
of
communication
i
believe.
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
meadowmoor
case
who
talked
about
free
speech
in
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
rational
modes
of
communicating
ideas.
and
i
suppose
that
that'd
be
communication,
it
has
to
be
transmission
and
reception.
and
transmission
and
reception
occurs
when
there
are
transmitters
and
receivers.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
it
probably
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
that's
why
i
started
in
response
to
this
colloquy
your
honor,
that
i
would
hope
that
we
would
not
have
to
argue
this
question
here.
this
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
non-possession.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
or
wouldn't
be
symbolic
speech
but
we
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
we
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
certainly
do
not
argue.
as
the
government
in
its
brief
suggests
that
under
our
theory,
anything
which
communicates
is
protected
and
that
anything
which
communicates
an
idea
is
protected.
we
don't
argue
that
the
dumping
of
garbage
is
protected
or
that
political
assassination
is
protected
or
that
any
other
of
the
fanciful
notions
which
the
government
seeks
to
charges
with
is
protected.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
would
like
to
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
lines
should
be
drawn
in
accordance
with
the
proper
application
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
however,
we
feel
that
even
if
the
court
would
choose
to
apply
the
ad
hoc
balancing
test
that
the
various
values
which
are
placed
on
the
balance
on
both
sides
are
such
so
that
the
statute
cannot
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
if
i
would
defend
it,
mr.
justice
fortas
on
the
basis
that
you
used
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
but
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
much
easier
to
show
a
valid
governmental
purpose
for
the
requirement
that
income
tax
records
be
preserved
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
that
it
is
for
the
requirement
that
a
person
have
in
his
possession
or
that
a
person
be
enjoined
from
mutilating
or
destroying
the
selective
service
certificate.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
would
think
that
these
are
items
which
can
properly
be
weighed
in
the
judicial
constitutional
balance.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
let
me
address
myself
at
this
point
then,
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
various
suggestions
which
have
been
made
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
this
court
and
in
other
courts
and
by
the
learned
solicitor
general
that
this
is
a
proper
indication
of
the
power
to
raise
armies
because
it
serves
some
role
in
the
selective
service
--
in
the
administration
of
selective
service.
now
i
believe
i
count
to
three
or
four
occasions
when
the
solicitor
general
repeated
that
this
serves
a
valid
selective
service
--
a
valid
function
but
all
that
he
stated
was
referring
to
the
second
circuit's
opinion.
now,
i
believe
that
if
we
outlined
all
of
the
rationales
which
are
presented
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
as
well
as
those
in
the
brief
presented
by
the
government,
we
are
left
with
no
more
than
the
possibility
that
the
certificate
may
serve
some
notice
giving
or
identification
purpose
exclusively
for
the
benefit
of
the
registrant
himself.
and
that
only
under
the
most
remote
possible
conditions
can
it
be
suggested
that
it
serves
some
function
for
the
government.
it
is
well-known
that
the
selective
service
system
keeps
elaborate
records
at
its
national
headquarters
and
emergency
records
of
other
kinds
as
well.
now,
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
reason
why
the
solicitor
general
was
not
more
explicit
in
stating
these
reasons
is
that
some
of
them
are
so
fanciful
as
perhaps
not
to
be
worthy
of
mention
in
this
court.
and
i
noticed
that
two
of
those
which
have
been
suggested
in
the
lower
courts
have
not
been
suggested
in
this
court,
namely
that
in
the
even
of
an
earthquake,
disaster
or
other
flood
why
--
or
something
of
a
nature
of
a
flood,
it
would
be
possible
for
--
there'd
be
a
quick
reconstruction
of
the
records
if
all
men
would
be
ordered
to
report
to
a
certain
place
by
radio
or
television.
and
the
final
suggestion
which
was
made
in
the
arguments
below
but
thankfully
not
in
this
court
was
that
in
the
even
of
an
enemy
missile
attack
and
a
call
by
radio
why
persons
could
be
ordered
to
report
to
certain
places
in
accordance
with
their
draft
classifications
and
that
would
serve
a
valid
governmental
purpose.
the
only
other
purpose,
which
it
was
suggested
is
served
is
that
when
the
registrant
to
his
local
board,
in
the
event
he
may
have
forgotten
his
number
or
forgotten
the
address
of
his
board
while
it
may
assist
in
this
identification
if
he
has
the
card
in
his
possession.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
all
that
the
government
can
offer
in
support
of
this,
it
is
a
very,
very
light
balance
indeed.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
enforcement
of
what
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
seems
there,
does
not
seem
to
be
--
it
does
not
seem
to
play
any
role
in
the
enforcement
of
the
selective
service
laws.
no
mention
of
it
can
be
found
in
any
of
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
material
which
selective
service
is
published
and
the
selective
service
system
has
been
administering
the
selective
service
laws
in
1940.
i
think
it
is
most
surprising
indeed
that
not
only
was
no
selective
service
testimony
presented
to
congress
but
at
anytime,
in
the
course
of
all
of
this
litigation
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
appellate
courts,
able
attorneys
for
the
government
have
not
been
able
to
come
forward
with
even
a
single
statement
on
the
part
of
any
selective
service
official
or
defense
department
official
or
governmental
official
showing
that
this
serves
any
purpose
at
all.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
of
course,
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
it's
not
that
purpose
served
at
the
time
that
it's
received.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
reason
is
to
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
two
certificates,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there's
a
registration
certificate
and
a
notice
of
classification.
the
registration
certificate
is
permanent.
the
notice
of
classification
changes
with
its
classification
as
a
means
of
notifying
the
registrant
of
classification.
and
certainly
upon
receipt,
it's
serves
that
notice
purpose.
but
that
is
a
purpose
presumably
for
the
benefit
of
the
registrant
which
we
would
argue
the
registrant
can
waive.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
of
states,
it
is
common
knowledge
that
it
serves
many
purposes.
if
one
has
to
look
for
common
knowledge,
the
common
knowledge
which
most
people
know
that
selective
service
certificates
serve
is
that
it
helps
to
identify
a
registrant
as
being
18
years
of
age,
in
a
state
where
18
years
old
are
allowed
to
purchase
alcoholic
beverages.
that's
the
only
common
knowledge
with
regards
to
selective
service
certificates.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
perhaps,
some
are
interested
in
other
types
of
sustenance,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
can't
see,
mr.
justice
brennan,
how
that's
serves
a
governmental
purpose.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
if
it
tells
you
--
if
a
piece
of
paper
tells
you
of
the
date
of
your
birth,
i
can't
see
what
other
purpose
it
serves
other
than
to
allow
you
to
present
some
proof
as
to
your
date
of
birth.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
has
this
knowledge.
the
government
has
this
knowledge
at
the
time
the
young
men
registers
and
the
government
has
many,
many
sources
for
obtaining
this
information.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
is
any
dereliction
or
delinquency
or
violation
of
the
selective
service
statute,
the
position
or
retention
or
non-possession
or
non-retention
of
this
card
will
have
no
effect
on
the
government's
ability
to
prosecute.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
must
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suppose
that
one
could
question
whether
or
not
any
problem
of
self-incrimination
might
be
raised
by
someone
being
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
know
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
are
not
making
any
such
argument,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
an
argument
which
--
but,
i
do
wish
to
repeat
that
david
o'brien
was
neither
indicted,
nor
tried
nor
convicted
for
non-possession.
he
was
indicted
and
tried
and
convicted
for
burning,
for
violating
the
1965
amendment.
that
is
the
only
question
we
respectfully
submit
before
this
court.
and
there
is
a
special
area
of
constitutional
questions
which
are
--
which
arise
because
of
the
manner
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
with
respect
believe
that
this
can
be
avoided
notwithstanding
the
suggestion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
distinction
between
congressional
motive
and
congressional
purpose
is
illusive
to
the
government.
i
believe
that
the
entire
legislative
history,
which
we
have
set
forth
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
we've
done
this
deliberately
because
we
don't
wish
to
be
open
to
this
suggestion
that
we
are
picking
and
choosing,
demonstrates
beyond
any
question
that
the
only
congressional
purpose
here
was
the
purpose
of
stamping
out
dissent,
of
stamping
out
this
particular
form
and
expression
of
dissent.
the
government
indeed
so
acknowledged
it
and
the
solicitor
general
acknowledged
it
in
part
of
his
argument.
the
government
was
seeking
to
punish
contumacious
conduct.
the
government
acknowledges
that
--
it
says
that
perhaps
some
of
the
purposes
will
less
constitutionally
justify
than
others.
the
government
acknowledges
that
at
least
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
declare
draft
card
burning
insulting
and
unpatriotic.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
congress
to
declare
it
a
felony
which
could
send
the
young
man
to
jail
for
five
years
because
congress
believes
his
conduct
to
be
insulting
and
unpatriotic.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
quite
something
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
quite
so,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
argument
directed
at
the
unconstitutional
purpose
and
the
manifestation
of
unconstitutional
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
congress
would
be
the
same,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
perhaps,
i
did
not
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
where
there
is
such
an
extensive
degree
of
congressional
excess,
unconstitutional
excess
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
the
act
which
was
passed
as
a
result
of
it
is
on
its
face
unconstitutional.
congress
could
not
have
declared
it
to
be
a
crime
for
someone
to
stand
up
and
say,
“this
selective
certificate
in
my
hand,
i
detest
it
and
everything
for
which
it
stands".
no
more
can
congress
declare
it
a
crime
or
someone
who,
at
the
time
that
he
sets
it
and
sets
fire
to
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
may
i
first,
with
respect,
mr.
justice
fortas
comment
on
your
terminology.
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
distinguished
between
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
let
me
correct
my
own
then,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
distinction
which
we
are
urging
upon
this
court
and
which
has
been
utilized
by
courts
of
appeals,
but
i
must
admit
not
yet
directly
and
explicitly
by
this
court,
is
between
a
--
is
between
that
which
is
called
“motivation”
which
is
the
unrevealed
reason
why
a
member
of
a
legislature
cast
or
doesn't
cast
a
vote.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
do
believe
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
i
do
have
authority
which
points
strongly
in
that
direction,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
refer
to
the
case
of
grosjean
against
the
american
press
company
and
the
case
of
gomillion
against
lighfoot,
the
tuskegee
racial
gerrymandering
case.
i
believe
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
went
very
close,
came
very
close
to
it
stating
that
where
the
legislative
purpose
is
manifestly
improper,
the
court
is
not
obliged
to
look
any
further.
i
believe
that
grosjean
perhaps
even
more
strongly
than
the
other
one.
however,
i
do
respectfully
commend
to
the
court
the
distinctions
which
were
most
explicitly
stated
by
circuit
judge
sofaer
in
the
in
the
petty
case
on
page
24
of
our
brief
and
by
circuit
judge
brown
in
the
gomillion
case
before
it
came
to
this
court
on
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
and
in
both
of
these
cases,
i
believe
that
these
distinguished
members
of
the
fifth
circuit
indicated
that
--
forgive
me,
legislative
motive,
good
or
bad,
is
irrelevant
to
the
process
of
judicial
review
but
legislative
purpose
is
of
primary
importance
in
determining
the
propriety
of
legislative
action
since
the
purpose
itself
must
be
within
the
legislative
competence
and
the
method
used
must
be
reasonably
widely
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
again,
what
the
legislature
of
alabama
as
distinguished
from
its
members
intended
on
this
court
and
what
the
purpose
on
this
court
of
the
legislature
as
distinguished
from
its
members
was
in
the
enactment
of
this
law
is
that
a
traditional
matter
well
concern
to
the
judiciary.
now,
the
best
cases
that
i
can
cite,
decisions
by
this
court
is
the
case
of
grosjean
and
the
case
of
gomillion.
now
in
grosjean,
mr.
justice
sutherland
writing
for
the
court
spoke
of
two
things.
he
spoke
both
of
the
history
of
this
type
of
legislation.
this
if
i
may
refresh
the
recollection
of
all
of
us
was
the
newspaper
tax
law
enacted
by
the
huey
long
administration
in
the
state
of
louisiana
in
the
30's
which
had
the
clear
effect
of
discriminating
against
the
large
city
newspapers
in
favor
of
the
smaller
rural
newspapers
with
obvious
political
consequences.
and,
mr.
justice
sutherland
spoke
both
of
the
history
of
this
type
of
legislation
and
also
the
setting
in
which
it
was
passed.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
court
looked
at
the
setting
in
1930
in
the
grosjean
case.
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
the
setting
in
which
some
of
these
statutes
were
passed
in
the
petty
case
and
then
in
the
gomillion
case
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
should
not
be
and
will
not
be,
as
mr.
chief
justice
taft
observed
in
another
context,
too
blind
to
see
what
all
others
can
see.
the
setting
and
the
purpose
of
this
law,
when
it
was
passed
by
congress
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
it
had
only
one
purpose
in
mind.
nobody
was
concerned
with
anything
else.
all
of
that
is
subsequent
rationalizations,
subsequent
papering
is
over
by
able
attorneys
for
the
government
at
various
levels.
the
first
circuit
saw
that
there
was
no
rationale
legislative
purpose.
they
cited
grosjean
and
gomillion
but
they
didn't
comment
on
it.
they
say,
“we
won't
comment
on
the
purpose
on
whether
it
was
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
we
won't
say
whether
it
was
illegitimate
because
we
find
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose”.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
the
entire
reading
of
the
entire
legislative
history
would
make
this
clear.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
that
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
and
i
say
this
to
someone
who
has
a
deep
respect
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
have
a
number
of
personal
friends
who
were
in
congress.
i
think
that
the
congressional
action
in
this
case
was
an
act
of
hysteria
rather
than
act
of
reflection
and
there
was
a
desire
to
do
something
real
fast
to
punish
what
they
re
--
considered
to
be
unpatriotic.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
all
that
i
can
do,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
to
respectfully
repeat
that
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
look
into
the
motives
of
the
393
persons
who
voted
for
it.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
look
at
the
two-committee
chairman,
who
were
two
of
the
three
people
to
spoke
and
that
the
only
person
who
spoke,
the
authoritative
spokesman.
now,
a
learned
solicitor
general
points
out
that
only
three
spoke
but
in
fact,
this
straightens
the
argument
because
it
would
be
otherwise
perhaps
if
they
were
some
distinction
or
some
mixture
in
the
legislative
history,
some
non-unanimity.
but
here,
it's
unanimity.
all
three
who
spoke,
spoke
for
one
purpose.
we
have
to
do
this
to
support
our
voice.
we
have
to
do
this
to
punish
these
beatnik
kids.
that
is
the
gist
of
it.
i
am
not
quoting
out
of
context
that
can
be
easily
read
and
seen.
now,
if
there
was
ever
a
case,
where
it
was
appropriate,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
to
follow
the
precedent
which
it
reached
in
the
grosjean
case
and
the
suggestions
made
in
those
fifth
circuit
cases
which
i
cited.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
shall
i
continue,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
thank
you.
i
believe
that
it's
important
to
consider
the
--
not
the
cases
which
this
court
has
not
decided,
which
the
learned
solicitor
general
has
referred
to,
the
stover
case
in
new
york
or
the
flag
burning
case
which
has
not
yet
come
to
this
court
but
cases
which
this
court
has
actually
decided
and
where
this
court
has
developed
and
utilized
and
applied
the
doctrine
of
symbolic
speech.
the
two
chief
cases,
of
course,
are
the
red
flag
case,
stromberg
against
california
and
the
flag
salute
case,
was
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette.
now,
these
cases
are
cited,
passages
are
quoted
in
our
brief.
but
it
is
very
clear
from
these
cases
and
from
later
gloss,
which
this
court
has
put
on
it
that
abstract
discussion
is
not
the
only
the
form
of
speech
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
that
it
does
refer
to
certain
types
of
action.
and
to
put
it
another
way,
that
the
only
type
of
action
which
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
is
not
limited
to
the
movement
of
the
vocal
chords
that
it
protects
other
kinds
of
action
as
well.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
meadowmoor
case
which
pointed
out
that
certain
types
of
labor
activity
could
not
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
sir.
no
wagon
drivers
union
against
meadowmoor
dairies,
the
courts
--
according
to
my
brief,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
and
i'm
embarrassed
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
embarrassed
and
may
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
(inaudible).
it's
probably
an
oversight
in
the
editing
of
brief.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
language,
which
i'm
suggesting
and
which
carries
full
with
the
rationale
of
symbolic
speech
is
that
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
--
back
of
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
lay
faith
on
the
power
of
an
appeal
to
reason
by
all
of
the
peaceful
means
for
gaining
access
to
the
mind.
it
was
an
order
to
avert
force
and
explosions
due
to
restrictions
upon
rationale
modes
of
communication
that
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
was
given
so
generous
in
the
scope.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
it
would
have
to
be
tested
against
one
of
the
constitutional
test
which
was
applied
by
this
court
in
first
amendment
cases
out
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
or
the
balancing
test.
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
under
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
turn
to
a
different
case.
i
think
the
doctrine
and
notion
of
symbolic
speech
received
further
development
by
mr.
justice
harlan
of
this
court
and
what
i'm
sure
was
the
concurring
opinion,
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
garner
against
louisiana.
and
by
mr.
justice
fortas
of
this
court
in
what
was
called
the
prevailing
opinion
in
brown
against
louisiana.
in
both
of
which,
i
believe
that
the
notion
that
speech
means
more
than
just
a
movement
of
the
vocal
chords
was
developed.
in
various
cases
and
also
in
the
learned
article
by
professor
kelvin,
various
shorthand
expressions
have
been
used
to
describe
it.
the
working
man's
commute
--
means
of
communication
has
been
used
to
describe
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
very
true.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
precisely
the
problem,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
are
suggesting
that
this
comes
within
the
classical
doctrines
of
symbolic
speech
that
it
meets
the
criteria
of
symbolic
speech
which
this
court
has
announced.
it
has
all
the
whole
(inaudible)
of
it,
the
principle
one
of
which
is
had
it
as
peaceful
and
it
is
non-violent.
and
indeed,
distinctions
could
be
made
to
show
that
the
peaceful
ritual
like
act
of
setting
fire
to
a
piece
of
paper
as
part
of
a
demonstration
against
the
government
policy
which
this
piece
of
paper
represents
is
much
more
within
the
ambit
of
symbolic
speech
than
some
of
the
other
cases
where
it
has
been
applied.
there's
no
concerted
action
here.
no
action
of
large
numbers
of
persons
moving
their
bodies
in
any
direction
either
on
a
picket
line
or
in
a
radical
march
which
was
the
case
in
this
stromberg
case.
there
is
no
large
numbers
of
persons
going
into
a
place
of
private
property
as
in
the
lunch
counter
in
the
garner
case
or
into
a
public
place
like
the
library
in
brown
against
louisiana.
this
was
an
individual
act
of
a
single
person.
the
first
circuit
observed
that
there
was
no
active
incitement
or
agitation
of
others
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
a
case
could
not
come
within
this
court's
doctrine
of
symbolic
speech
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
i
must
respectfully
insist,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
recognize
the
unconstitutional
congressional
purpose,
then
it
need
not
go
into
such
a
careful
analysis
of
which
side
of
the
line
it
would
go.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
don't
say
that
at
all.
but
this
factor
is
so
clearly
and
inescapably
indicates
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
just
calls
for
consideration
by
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
the
court
can
reach
the
solution
which
i
respectfully
urge
upon
it
on
grounds
similar
to
those
found
by
the
first
circuit
which
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
grounds
are
that
regardless
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
statute
was
introduced
and
passed,
that
the
act
which
it
seeks
to
punish
is
an
act
of
symbolic
speech
within
the
traditional
decisions
of
this
court
recognizing
symbolic
speech.
that
it
is
as
much
if
not
more
symbolic
speech
than
peaceful
picketing,
than
a
peaceful
sit-in,
than
a
peaceful
stand-up
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
if
i
may
elaborate
on
it,
i
would
state
that
it's
certainly
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
being
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
any
--
to
the
accomplishment
of
any
substantive
congressional
purpose
and
i
would
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
can
be
decided
under
the
balancing
test
or
any
other
test
which
this
court
would
care
to
fashion
or
apply.
but
i
must
suggest
that
in
every
other
case
where
this
court
has
applied
symbolic
speech,
arguments
have
been
used
to
defend
the
statutes
saying
that
this
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
the
very
red
flag
law,
which
this
court
declared
unconstitutional
in
stromberg,
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
said
it's
of
proper
governmental
purpose
to
ban
red
flags
because
they
incite
people
to
riot.
we
cite
that
case
in
our
brief.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
passed
the
same
thing
and
that
congress
declares
that
it's
to
have
a
proper
--
that
it
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
members
of
congress,
it
has
a
proper
congressional
purpose
is
not
sufficient.
i
suggest
that
it's
incumbent
upon
this
court,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
incumbent
upon
this
court
when
a
constitutional
attack
is
made
and
when
something
at
least
appears
to
have
some
kind
of
effect
on
a
first
amendment
right
to
apply
one
of
the
constitutional
test
which
has
traditionally
been
applied.
i
think
it
should
also
be
mentioned
that
this
might
be
one
of
those
areas
where
there
is
a
mixture,
a
melding,
a
hybrid,
which
is
the
language
which
was
used
in
some
of
the
picketing
cases,
i
believe
of
where
there
is
speech
and
mixed
with
action.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
douglas
has
used
the
phrase
--
speech,
“brigaded
to
action”.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
analyze
what
is
it
that
the
statute
seeks
to
reach.
does
the
status
seek
to
reach
the
action
or
does
the
statute
seek
to
reach
the
speech?
i
suggest
that
not
only
the
legislative
history
but
the
--
but
just
the
plain
examination
of
what
the
statute
seeks
to
do
shows
that
it
seeks
to
reach
the
speech
because
as
the
first
circuit
pointed
out,
it
was
previously
in
existence,
a
regulation
with
the
same
penalty
which
would
presumably
reach
the
action.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
believe
that
chief
judge
aldrich
of
the
first
circuit
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
i
come
to
that
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
there
was
already
in
existence
a
regulation
seeking
to
punish
non-possession
--
the
non-possession
of
these
pieces
of
paper
and
that
consequently
that
it
does
not
appear
to
be
any
other
purpose
which
was
served
by
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
suppose
all
that
i
can
do
here,
mr.
justice
black,
is
to
refer
to
the
same
type
of
argument
which
might
have
been
advanced
in
support
of
the
spate
of
red
flag
laws,
which
were
enacted
by
state
legislatures
in
the
1920's
and
everybody
thought
that
they
were
reasonable
laws.
and
state
supreme
courts
held
that
they
were
constitutional.
that
they
were
valid
means
whereby
state
legislatures
could
seek
to
control
the
dangers
of
incipient
radical
movements
and
of
agitation
caused
by
radical
movements
and
riots
and
violence
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
that
with
respect
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
would
say
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
say
that
there
is
perhaps
a
greater
legislative
power
to
regulate
where
there
is
an
element
of
conduct
involved
than
there
is
in
a
case
where
there
is
pure
speech.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
writing
for
the
court
in
coax
against
louisiana.
we
don't
challenge
that
there
is
greater
regulatory
power
where
there
is
conduct
brigaded
to
the
speech
but
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
that's
one
of
the
arguments
which
we
make
in
the
alternative,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
was
going
to
cite
that,
mr.
justice
stewart
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
i
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
court,
refer
the
court
now
that
the
red
light
has
gone
on
that
a
case
companion
to
thornhill,
the
carlson
case
actually
brings
the
language
of
symbolic
speech
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
into
peaceful
picketing.
if
i
can
just
say
in
summation,
i
have
a
last
--
not
been
able
to
reach
other
points
which
i
hoped
i
will
have
enough
opportunity
to
reach
that
--
just
as
decisions
of
this
court
have
referred
to
peaceful
picketing
as
the
workingman's
means
of
communication
and
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
if
it
was
the
swing
case,
mr.
justice
black
or
if
it
was
the
thornhill-carlson
cases.
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
dispute
that
without
actually
having
the
books
in
front
of
me.
and
just
as
the
sit-in
has
been
called
the
poor
man's
printing
press,
i
would
like
tor
respectfully
suggest
that
perhaps
the
act
of
an
unknown,
obscure
pacifist,
who
wants
to
engage
in
the
dramatic
anti-war
act
of
burning
his
draft
card
makes
draft
card
burning
the
war
protestor's
tv
transmitter.
thank
you
very
much.
