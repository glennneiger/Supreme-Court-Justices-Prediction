justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
franchisee
benefited
from
the
restrictions
which
they
have
now
objected
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
these
were
not
found
below,
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
these
restrictions
have
violated
the
sherman
act.
i
suppose
they
were
for
the
benefit
of
at
least
the
midas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
show
me
how
they
benefited
the
dealers
that
this
exclusion
from
purchasing
from
others
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn’t
it
--
they
will
be
wholly
consistent
with
that
for
a
franchisee
to
be
able
to
purchase
a
similar
part
or
a
similar
system
from
the
competitor
and
also
a
specialist.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
government
--
would
you
concede
or
not
that
the
government
could
have
gotten
an
injunction
against
this
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
a
franchisee
comes
to
midas
and
says,
“look,
we
find
this
profitable
arrangement.
the
midas
has
a
good,
very
good
product
and
we
can
make
money
on
it,
lots
of
money
even
by
living
up
to
this
provision,
but
we
don’t
like
them.
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
buy
a
competing
system
and
have
midas
on
one
side
of
the
shop
and
xyz
on
the
other
side
and
we’ll
advertise
both
and
both
companies
are
going
to
advertise”
and
that
the
midas
says
“sorry,
no.
you
might
make
more
money
that
way,
but
you’re
either
with
us
100%
or
not
at
all”.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
then
that
in
pari
delicto
would
still
apply
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
franchisee
said,
“well,
if
that’s
the
way
it
is.
i’d
rather
have
you
this
way
than
not
at
all”.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
such
a
loaded
word,
that
“voluntary”
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don’t
think
it’s
essential
to
where
in
pari
delicto
to
apply
that
it
would
be
shown
that
the
person
who
is
suing
benefited
himself
from
the
restrictions
which
he
is
now
objecting
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
balance
do
you
think
it’s
enough
if
it’s
just
shown
that
he
made
a
profit
out
of
the
whole
arrangement?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
was
not
to
his
economic
benefit
to
live
up
to
the
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
a
matter
--
that
might
be
a
matter
of
proof
on
damages
but
i
don’t
know
why
should
it
be
in
pari
delicto,
why
should
they
be
precluded
from
proving
that
by
a
defense
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you,
in
a
word,
then
you
say
that
in
pari
delicto
--
pari
delicto
applies
even
though
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
he
would
have
made
more
money
absent
to
these
restrictions
with
them,
but
that
he
certainly
voluntarily
went
along
with
the
scheme
because
he
could
still
make
a
pretty
good
profit
with
restrictions.
you
think
that’s
part
of
the
suit
on
those
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
i
have
to
make
a
choice
which
i
obviously
do,
i’m
going
to
do
--
live
up
to
this
restriction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
be
a
matter
of
proof
as
to
--
but
what
about
the
defense
on
those
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defense
in
pari
delicto
that
they
participated
in
the
scheme
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
to
make
your
objection
known
and
then
all
you
can
sue
for
later
is
what
happens
to
you
after
that
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
while
ago
i
thought
you’ve
said
that
if
the
franchisee
makes
his
objection
known
to
the
--
to
midas,
he
had
made
his
objection
known
to
midas
and
said
“i
could
make
more
money
without
these
restrictions
but
if
you
insist,
i
will
stick
with
it.”
you
wouldn't
insist
on
in
pari
--
you
said
you
wouldn’t
be
here
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
franchisee
had
simply
violated
the
exclusive
dealing
condition
of
the
franchise
and
it
simply
bought
from
a
competitor
and
sold
the
competitors
goods
along
with
midas
and
midas
had
terminated
the
franchise
at
that
time
for
violation
of
the
exclusive
dealing
provision,
would
you
still
have
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
simpson
would
even
apply
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
simpson
would
apply
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
like
the
franchisee
could
sue
midas
here
for
--
if
it
happened
to
sell
to
somebody
else
in
the
exclusive
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
argue
then
on
--
on
the
basis
here
that
if
a
competitor
sued,
one
midas
competitor
sued,
he
should
be
able
to
sue
both
midas
and
the
franchisees
as
co-conspirator?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
he
has
--
you
wouldn’t
think
you
would
have
to
attain
the
status
of
a
co-conspirator
to
--
before
he
was
barred
by
pari
delicto.
justice
byron
r.
white
coerced
into
accepting
exclusive
territories?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
this
exclusive
territory
was
not
of
benefit
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn’t
going
to
have
any
midas
competition
in
its
own
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
will
be
your
damage
claim
if
this
case
is
reversed?
now
what
would
you
claim
damages
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
midas
could
sensibly
ask
you
to
the
damages
for
restricting
them
from
selling
in
your
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
the
