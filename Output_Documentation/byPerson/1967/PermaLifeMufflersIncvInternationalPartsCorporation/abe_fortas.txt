justice

suppose
one
of
these
petitioners
decided
to
go
under
the
automobile
muffler
business
that
he
have
a
realistic
economic
choice
between
entering
into
this
franchise
arrangement
with
perma
life
or
whatever
the
name
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
midas
or
entering
into
an
arrangement
with
other
suppliers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
i’d
like
you
to
broaden
your
answer
to
the
question
whether
or
not
it
involved
the
franchise
arrangement.
was
there
some
other
way
in
which
a
petitioner
who
felt
a
call
to
enter
the
muffler
business
could
enter
the
muffler
business
in
his
locality
without
entering
into
this
franchise
arrangement
with
midas?
justice
abe
fortas
he
would
have
had
adequate
supplies
available
to
him
on
a
competitive
basis
that
would
enable
him
to
upgrade
in
the
marketplace.
justice
abe
fortas
i
remember
seeing
somewhere
in
the
briefs
that
midas
was
about
a
number
of
what
was
it,
four
or
five?
justice
abe
fortas
number
5
in
the
share
of
market?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
were
four
companies
that
were
bigger
in
terms
of
manufacture
and
supply
of
mufflers
to
the
retailers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
while
the
other
companies
must
have
sold
their
mufflers
to
somebody?
justice
abe
fortas
i’m
sure
you
see
what’s
bothering
me
that
is
assuming
that
in
pari
delicto
has
a
role,
a
significant
role
in
this
field,
if
you
make
that
assumption
and
there
is
a
next
question
i
think
which
is
whether
in
determining
in
a
particular
case
the
retailers
in
pari
delicto
whether
he
had
available
to
him
an
alternative
or
whether
because
of
the
economic
power
of
the
franchiser,
he
had
no
alternative
except
to
enter
into
this
particular
agreement.
i’m
not
saying
that
that’s
a
controlling
consideration,
but
to
my
mind,
it
has
a
bearing
from
the
resolution
of
the
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
pari
delicto?
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
confine
pari
delicto
to
situations
where
there’s
so
to
speak
a
partnership
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
illegal
restraints?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
simpson
against
union
oil
company.
as
i
read
your
brief
you
distinguished
that
case
solely
on
the
grounds
that
in
pari
delicto
as
such
was
not
discussed
in
this
court’s
opinion.
simpson
against
union
oil
company
did
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff
was
barred
triple
damage
action
by
a
consent.
there
was
a
franchise
arrangement,
was
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now
forgetting
about
the
technical
point
as
to
whether
in
pari
delicto
was
adjudicated,
is
there
a
material
difference
in
the
basic
factual
situation
in
your
mind
between
simpson
and
your
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
understand
that.
what
participation?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
you
say
in
number
one,
the
point
of
distinction
is
that
in
the
present
case,
the
franchisees
did
participate
in
the
discussion
or
something
of
the
sort
of
the
terms
of
the
arrangement.
what’s
the
other
distinction?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
happened
in
one
of
the
cases
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
does
that
make,
to
be
terminated?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
are
the
three
points
of
distinction
and
any
others
between
this
case
and
simpson
against
union
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
those
figures
don’t
cover
all
replacement
mufflers
and
exhaust
systems?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
well,
the
question
is
whether
general
motors
and
ford
and
so
on
buy
at
least
replacement
mufflers
from
these
companies,
the
sales
which
included
in
those
figures?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
one
of
these
petitioners
decided
to
