mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
us
this
morning
is
really
a
narrow
issue,
but
it
is
not
quite
as
narrow
as
my
brother,
mr.
rolnick
implied
yesterday.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
simply
by
the
execution
of
these
franchise
arrangements
that
the
plaintiffs
became
in
pari
delicto.
in
the
opinion,
a
portion
of
which
we
have
set
out
at
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
court
specifically
states
the
factors
which
to
it
rendered
these
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto.
in
addition
to
the
initial
entering
into
the
agreement,
the
court
says,
“each
plaintiff
thereafter
eagerly
sought
additional
shops.
furthermore,
each
plaintiff
cooperated
with
the
defendants
and
all
other
midas
dealers
in
the
conduct
which
plaintiffs
now
assert
was
illegal.
each
plaintiff
accepted
the
benefits
arising
out
of
the
franchise
agreements.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
our
position
that
this
entire
franchise
concept
which
was
created
by
the
defendants
and
in
which
the
plaintiffs
joined
by
its
very
nature
carried
with
it
certain
restrictions
and
that
these
restrictions
in
turn
created
additional
restrictions
so
that
each
of
the
parties
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
we
think
they
were
for
the
benefit
of
both
midas
and
the
dealer.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
midas
concept
was
that
specialization
in
exhaust
system
parts
backed
by
national
advertising
would
bring
in
to
the
point
of
shops
people
who
were
never
before
had
been
conscious
of
automotive
exhaust
systems.
this
emphasis
on
exclusivity,
this
advertising
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
defendants
of
the
advantages
or
specialization
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
concept
envisioned
that
the
midas
trade
and
service
marks
which
each
plaintiff
displayed
in
his
place
of
business
would
be
part
of
the
attraction
of
this
whole
arrangement.
that
the
plaintiffs
in
exchange
for
midas
giving
up
the
right
to
sell
the
muffler
to
other
dealers
in
their
territory
would
concentrate
on
midas.
that
the
dealers,
being
protected
from
intra-brand
competition
of
course
would
have
to
prohibit
wholesale
sellers
among
the
dealers
in
order
to
be
sure
of
that
protection
from
competition.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
to
realize
that
we
are
talking
in
this
case
about
1955
and
not
1968.
and
certainly
in
1968,
we
are
not
upholding
the
legality
of
the
provisions
of
this
franchise
agreement.
we
have
assumed
that
for
purposes
of
this
motion
that
the
arrangement
was
illegal.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
i
--
well,
we
would
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
it
isn’t
mr.
justice
white.
we
wouldn’t
say
that
in
pari
delicto
would
apply
to
that
case.
we
say,
our
position
in
our
brief
that
the
three
circumstances
have
to
coincide
before
there’s
pari
delicto.
there
has
to
be
a
voluntary
arrangement
containing
certain
restrictions
on
both
parties
which
entered
into
in
the
expectation
of
profit.
they
have
to
participate
in
that
arrangement
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
concede
that,
they
have
to
enter
into
that
arrangement
and
they
have
to
accept
the
benefits
from
the
arrangement.
then,
there
comes
a
disagreement
and
a
falling
out
and
one
sues
the
other
on
the
basis
that
the
arrangement
was
illegal
and
claiming
that
he
might
have
made
more
profits
if
he
had
not
been
subject
to
those
restrictions
in
the
first
place.
and
we
say
that
only
then,
only
in
the
circumstances
really
of
this
case
does
pari
delicto
apply.
you
have
to
have
full
and
voluntary
participation.
it’s
not
enough
that
they
merely
enter
into
an
agreement
or
consent
to
these
restrictions
of
which
you’re
speaking.
they
have
to
cooperate,
they
have
to
work
with
them
and
they
have
to
profit
from
them.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
don’t
think
that’s
essential,
but
we
think
that
(voice
overlap)
happened
here.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
yes,
sir.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
say
that
it
had
to
be
that
as
economic
benefit
to
live
up
to
the
restrictions
because
rightly
or
wrongly,
no
matter
what
they
thought,
all
of
these
restrictions
were
in
equitably,
interwoven
in
the
program
from
which
they
obtained
profit.
and
who
can
tell
whether
or
not
they
would’ve
obtained
profit
absent
one
or
more
of
these
restrictions.
and
it
is
the
fact
that
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
because
they
did
give
up
these
rights
voluntarily
to
accept
the
benefits
of
the
entire
program.
if
they
wanted
to
renounce,
they
should
renounce
the
whole
program
or
if
they
perhaps
if
they
had
come
to
the
defendants
in
the
way
that
your
honor
described,
we
would
not
be
here
today,
but
the
point
is
that
they
didn’t.
that
in
this
particular
case,
these
particular
plaintiffs
terminated
midas.
we
did
not
terminate
them.
what
they
wanted
was
not
relief
from
these
restrictions.
what
these
plaintiffs
wanted
was
still
more
franchise
agreements.
they
wanted
still
more
exclusive
territories.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
on
the
facts
that
he
could
--
he
thinks
he
could
show
that
he
could
make
more
money
absent
the
restriction.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
let
me
say
in
this
case
that
that
they
did
make
that
choice
when
they
terminated
midas.
they
went
into
a
program
sponsored
by
midas
competitors.
that
program
did
not
contain
these
allegedly
illegal
restrictions.
that
program
gave
them
the
exclusive
territories
for
the
whole
state
of
michigan
for
one,
for
all
of
washington
d.c.
for
another
and
that
program
did
not
prove
successful
and
it
was
only
then
that
they
brought
the
suit.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
defense
that
they
could
have
made
more
money
elsewhere?
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
think
it’s
enough.
if
they
participated
in
a
scheme
if
they
accepted
the
benefits
if
they
later
renounce
and
sued
claiming
that
they
could
have
made
more,
but
that’s
enough
to
apply
in
pari
delicto
irrespective
of
what
the
proof
might
have
been
as
to
what
they
could
have
done
elsewhere.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
don’t
--
i
didn’t
quite
comprehend
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
said
there
is
possibility
that
we
wouldn’t
be
here
because
that
is
not
the
facts
that
we
have
that
what
their
--
these
plaintiffs’
particular
objections
were
directed
to
were
not
the
restrictions
but
the
fact
that
we
didn’t
give
them
even
more
territories.
their
complaint,
paragraph
22m,
specifically
says
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs’
claims
for
damages
is
that
these
defendants
refused
the
repeated
request
of
the
plaintiffs
for
additional
franchises.
it
was
not
the
restrictions
to
which
they
were
objecting.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
think
that
there
is
both
a
factual
and
a
legal
distinction
of
simpson.
certainly
on
the
legal
grounds
there,
there
was
purely
consent
and
passive
acceptance
by
simpson
of
the
terms
imposed
by
union
oil
company.
there
was
not
the
participation
which
we
have
shown
here
by
simpson
in
the
terms
of
his
agreement
with
union
oil.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff,
mr.
max
ross
who
explained
that
these
dealers,
as
members
of
the
national
advisory
counsel,
which
were
the
top
ten
midas
dealers,
and
in
regional
and
national
dealer
meetings
as
the
elder
statesman
of
this
group
in
counseling
dealers,
discussed
all
aspects
of
this
program.
mr.
ross
specifically
said
that
these
were
very
comprehensive
discussions
lasting
from
morning
to
night.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
in
more
than
just
the
terms
in
developing
the
entire
concept
and
how
it
would
work.
as
the
other
distinction
is
concerned
that
there
of
course
factually
the
oil
company
had
terminated
the
dealer.
the
dealer
did
not
terminate
the
franchisor.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
in
this
case,
mr.
pierce
first
terminated
a
franchise
adamira
and
later
on
we
followed
up
with
terminations
of
the
rest
of
his
franchise
although
he
initiated
the
first
one
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
actually,
it
makes
a
difference
only
and
that
it
shows
that
these
plaintiffs
were
not
subject
to
the
restrictions.
it
wasn’t
the
restrictions
which
really
decided
the
issue.
they
were
voluntarily
getting
rid
of
midas.
they
thought
they
could
earn
more
in
another
program.
now
in
addition,
of
course,
the
comparison
in
size
and
equality
of
bargaining
power
between
a
corner
gas
station
and
union
oil
company
and
these
plaintiffs
and
midas,
which
at
the
time
we’re
talking
about,
were
selling
$5
million
in
total
sales,
not
midas
but
in
total
sales,
simply
doesn’t
match
up.
there’s
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
union
oil
and
the
court
rightly
said
there
that
this
implied
a
certain
lack
of
freedom
to
deal
on
the
part
of
the
dealer.
whereas
here,
i
think
we
have
shown
that
they
all
were
not
--
may
be
not
of
equal
bargaining
power
but
certainly
capable
of
bargaining
for
themselves
and
which
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
terminated
us
rather
than
our
terminating
them.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
think
that
the
fact
that
in
union
oil
and
simpson
and
all
the
gas
station
cases,
the
dealer
there
is
tied
to
the
oil
company,
to
the
supplier
by
a
lease
of
real
state
or
equipment
so
that
when
either
the
real
state
lease
is
terminated
or
the
sales
agreement
is
terminated,
that
dealer
is
out
of
business.
he
has
no
choice.
whereas
in
our
case,
there
is
no
lease
of
real
state;
there
is
no
lease
of
equipment.
and
as
shown
here,
the
dealers
did
continue
in
business
from
the
same
exact
places
selling
mufflers
and
other
additional
products
in
competition
with
midas
which
certainly
didn’t
happen
in
simpson.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
if
the
dealer,
if
you’re
talking
about
one
of
these
plaintiffs
and
that
were
the
only
circumstance,
i
think
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
pari
--
in
pari
delicto
as
to
the
reason
for
its
termination.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
simpson,
mr.
justice
white,
was
the
mere
passive
acceptance
by
that
plaintiff,
by
that
dealer
of
the
conditions
laid
down.
that
is
not
the
fact
here.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
ross
explained
how
they
discussed
these
things
from
morning
to
night,
how
this
thing
was
a
program,
a
society,
an
affiliation
and
how
it
was
a
group
of
people
with
a
common
interest
in
mind
and
that
all
of
them
worked
together
to
develop
this
concept.
they
all
thought
again,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
exclusive
dealing
was
necessary.
it
is
not
much
different
from
the
situation
which
the
court
faced
in
united
states
versus
general
motors
in
the
los
angeles
situation
where
there,
it
was
the
dealers
who
initiated
the
boycott
against
the
sales
to
discounters
and
the
court
there
said
that
this
amounted
to
a
horizontal
conspiracy
among
the
dealers
and
the
company
so
that
if
you
followed
it
to
its
logical
conclusion,
general
motors
would
be
able
to
sue
the
dealers
for
that
violation.
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
would
want
to
come
to
that
result
and
yet
in
pari
delicto,
it
doesn’t
apply
in
this
case.
in
an
antitrust
cases,
the
result
is
reached
not
only
in
general
motors,
but
that
any
two
horizontal
price
fixers,
competitors
--
each
of
whom
gives
up
his
right
to
fix
his
prices
in
the
expectation
that
the
group
action
will
prove
profitable,
but
sue
the
other
because
the
other
does
not
comply
with
the
agreement.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
if
the
franchisee
here
can
sue
midas
for
the
exclusive
arrangement,
then
midas
can
sue
the
dealer
for
keeping
him
--
for
not
allowing
midas
to
put
other
dealers
in
that
territory
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
either
makes
more
effective
law
enforcement
or
makes
much
sense
economically
or
judicially.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
application
of
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
here
will
further
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws.
petitioners
have
urged
that
affirmance
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
mean
that
the
court
has
legitimate
ties
to
immunize
franchisees.
but
that
is
not
at
all
so.
that
is
not
our
position;
we
know
that
is
not
the
law.
the
true
victim,
the
true
person
who
enters
into
these
contracts
solely
because
it’s
the
only
one
available,
still
has
the
right
under
simpson
and
under
the
other
coercion
cases.
but
when
they
have
participated
to
the
extent
they
have
participated
here,
when
they
have
asked
for
additional
franchises,
when
they
have
met
and
decided
on
such
parts
of
the
program
as
prevention
of
wholesale
sales.
when,
as
mr.
ross
said,
“it’s
a
society,
it’s
a
group”,
then
you
don’t
have
that
situation.
and
we
think
that
those
people
who
participate
actively
in
these
violations
should
also
be
precluded
from
suing
under
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
not
the
mere
execution
of
the
franchise
arrangement
which
rendered
the
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto
here.
petitioners
own
authorities
recognize
that
there
is
a
place
for
in
pari
delicto
in
the
antitrust
laws.
the
authors
of
both
the
law
review
articles
which
the
petitioners
cite
in
both
of
their
briefs
indicate
that
in
pari
delicto
should
be
retained
as
a
defense
against
section
4
actions
in
order
to
discourage
persons
from
participating
in
illegal
activities.
denying
the
defense
will
encourage
them
to
remain
in
these
illegal
arrangements
and
to
enter
into
them
in
the
expectation
that
if
the
thing
doesn’t
work
out,
they
might
secure
treble
damages.
way
back
in
1899,
this
court
explained
in
mcmillan
v.
hoffman
that
if
parties’
two
illegal
arrangements
recognize
that
one
may
enter
into
them,
they
place
themselves
outside
the
protection
of
the
law,
the
less
inclined
will
they
be
to
enter
into
such
arrangements.
and
in
that
way,
the
public
will
secure
rigid
adherence
to
the
law.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
facts
here
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
say
that
for
purposes
of
in
pari
delicto
that
the
dealer
amounts
to
a
co-conspirator.
the
determination
of
a
substantive
liability
in
a
conspiracy
case
by
a
competitor
is
not
within
the
purview
of
our
contention
here,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
we
say
that
he
has
to
meet
those
three
requirements.
he
has
to
voluntarily
participate,
actively
promote
and
accept
the
benefits
and
then
sue
alleging
that
it
was
illegal
and
that
he
might
have
done
better
elsewhere,
only
under
those
circumstances
will
in
pari
delicto
apply.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
but
certainly
the
facts
here
and
to
me
at
least
indicate
that
these
plaintiffs
would
have
mean
as
much
a
co-conspirator
as
were
the
gear
defendants
in
general
motors
in
the
los
angeles
boycott
case.
so
that
extent,
mr.
justice
white,
yes
i
think
that
they
could
be
properly
joined
if
i
were
suing
midas
as
a
competitor
of
midas.
and
after
all,
it
is
the
public
which
is
damaged
by
section
3
and
that
the
public
has
been
damaged
as
much
by
the
action
of
the
dealer
as
the
supplier,
certainly
the
dealer
should
be
held
responsible.
as
to
our
alternative
defense,
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
here
also
maintain
that
we
should
be
precluded
from
establishing
that
we
were
a
single
traitor.
here,
all
the
corporate
defendants
were
owned
by
nathan
and
gordon
sherman;
each
of
the
individual
defendants
operated
only
in
it's
corporate
capacity.
there
was
no
holding
out
of
separate
corporations.
midas
did
not
sell
any
goods
or
hire
any
people.
this
was
not
the
same
as
the
keeper-steward
situation
where
there
were
separate
divisions,
separate
executives
who
dealt
separately
with
the
plaintiffs.
this
was
purely
a
single
unit,
a
small
family
owned
business.
and
before
i
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
report,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
response
to
your
question
to
mr.
rolnick
that
the
figures
which
he
is
relying
on
here
are
contained
in
an
antitrust
complaint
filed
by
the
united
states
against
one
of
midas’
competitors
and
that
those
figures
indicate
sales,
total
sales
of
automotive
exhaust
products
in
the
united
states
of
sum
of
$160
million.
in
1955,
midas’
total
sales
or
international
parts
total
sales,
not
just
midas
sales
were
some
$5
million
which
means
that
most
we
were
around
3%
of
the
market.
his
complaint
alleges
that
we
tripled
our
sales
from
1955
to
the
time
that
this
case
was
decided
and
i
also
think
that
it’s
important
that
that
case
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
manufacturers
of
passenger
automobile
such
as
general
motors,
ford,
chrysler
and
studebaker
are
in
this
business,
are
particularly
in
the
installation
business.
and
although
it
doesn’t
reveal
any
figures
in
that
complaint
for
what
they
have
sold
or
what
their
dealers
sold,
saying
that
they
get
their
mufflers
from
some
of
midas’
competitors,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
these
large
companies
are
in
this
business,
makes
clear
that
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
enable
ourselves
to
compete
with
this
new
concept
and
with
this
new
idea.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
frankly,
i’m
not
sure.
i
think
what
they
do
is,
they
are
the
manufacturing
figures
of
the
companies
that
they
say
comprise
the
industry,
but
they
don’t
at
all
purport
to
deal
with
figures
for
installation
sales.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
can’t
answer
that
and
i
can
answer
from
the
complaint
which
of
course
is
not
in
the
record.
finally,
we
think
that
the
case
is
right
for
summary
judgment.
we
don’t
believe
that
they
have
raised
any
issue
as
to
any
material
fact
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
section
--
of
rule
51e.
we
filed
an
affidavit
which
was
consisted
solely
of
their
testimony
in
the
court
below.
and
we
filed
an
affidavit
of
the
shamans,
which
was
not
contradicted.
throughout
the
proceedings
below,
they
did
not
challenge
the
statement
in
our
appendix
summarizing
the
plaintiffs’
testimony
nor
did
they
challenge
the
sherman
affidavit.
these
counsels
thoroughly,
familiar
with
both
the
rules
on
the
facts
by
assertions
have
said
that
there
are
factual
issues.
but
here
again,
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
there
are
no
citations
to
the
record.
there
are
no
indications
of
true
evidence
with
respect
to
the
issues
which
they
attempt
to
raise
respecting
coercion,
mr.
pierce’s
termination
and
our
conspiracy.
by
their
motion
to
the
district
court
to
secure
additional
discovery
only
on
the
matter
of
trademarks,
they
recognized
that
everything
necessary
for
this
decision
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court’s
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
us
this
morning
is
really
a
narrow
issue,
but
it
is
not
quite
as
narrow
as
my
brother,
mr.
rolnick
implied
yesterday.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
simply
by
the
execution
of
these
franchise
arrangements
that
the
plaintiffs
became
in
pari
delicto.
in
the
opinion,
a
portion
of
which
we
have
set
out
at
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
court
specifically
states
the
factors
which
to
it
rendered
these
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto.
in
addition
to
the
initial
entering
into
the
agreement,
the
court
says,
“each
plaintiff
thereafter
eagerly
sought
additional
shops.
furthermore,
each
plaintiff
cooperated
with
the
defendants
and
all
other
midas
dealers
in
the
conduct
which
plaintiffs
now
assert
was
illegal.
each
plaintiff
accepted
the
benefits
arising
out
of
the
franchise
agreements.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
our
position
that
this
entire
franchise
concept
which
was
created
by
the
defendants
and
in
which
the
plaintiffs
joined
by
its
very
nature
carried
with
it
certain
restrictions
and
that
these
restrictions
in
turn
created
additional
restrictions
so
that
each
of
the
parties
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
we
think
they
were
for
the
benefit
of
both
midas
and
the
dealer.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
midas
concept
was
that
specialization
in
exhaust
system
parts
backed
by
national
advertising
would
bring
in
to
the
point
of
shops
people
who
were
never
before
had
been
conscious
of
automotive
exhaust
systems.
this
emphasis
on
exclusivity,
this
advertising
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
defendants
of
the
advantages
or
specialization
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
concept
envisioned
that
the
midas
trade
and
service
marks
which
each
plaintiff
displayed
in
his
place
of
business
would
be
part
of
the
attraction
of
this
whole
arrangement.
that
the
plaintiffs
in
exchange
for
midas
giving
up
the
right
to
sell
the
muffler
to
other
dealers
in
their
territory
would
concentrate
on
midas.
that
the
dealers,
being
protected
from
intra-brand
competition
of
course
would
have
to
prohibit
wholesale
sellers
among
the
dealers
in
order
to
be
sure
of
that
protection
from
competition.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
to
realize
that
we
are
talking
in
this
case
about
1955
and
not
1968.
and
certainly
in
1968,
we
are
not
upholding
the
legality
of
the
provisions
of
this
franchise
agreement.
we
have
assumed
that
for
purposes
of
this
motion
that
the
arrangement
was
illegal.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
i
--
well,
we
would
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
it
isn’t
mr.
justice
white.
we
wouldn’t
say
that
in
pari
delicto
would
apply
to
that
case.
we
say,
our
position
in
our
brief
that
the
three
circumstances
have
to
coincide
before
there’s
pari
delicto.
there
has
to
be
a
voluntary
arrangement
containing
certain
restrictions
on
both
parties
which
entered
into
in
the
expectation
of
profit.
they
have
to
participate
in
that
arrangement
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
concede
that,
they
have
to
enter
into
that
arrangement
and
they
have
to
accept
the
benefits
from
the
arrangement.
then,
there
comes
a
disagreement
and
a
falling
out
and
one
sues
the
other
on
the
basis
that
the
arrangement
was
illegal
and
claiming
that
he
might
have
made
more
profits
if
he
had
not
been
subject
to
those
restrictions
in
the
first
place.
and
we
say
that
only
then,
only
in
the
circumstances
really
of
this
case
does
pari
delicto
apply.
you
have
to
have
full
and
voluntary
participation.
it’s
not
enough
that
they
merely
enter
into
an
agreement
or
consent
to
these
restrictions
of
which
you’re
speaking.
they
have
to
cooperate,
they
have
to
work
with
them
and
they
have
to
profit
from
them.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
don’t
think
that’s
essential,
but
we
think
that
(voice
overlap)
happened
here.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
yes,
sir.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
say
that
it
had
to
be
that
as
economic
benefit
to
live
up
to
the
restrictions
because
rightly
or
wrongly,
no
matter
what
they
thought,
all
of
these
restrictions
were
in
equitably,
interwoven
in
the
program
from
which
they
obtained
profit.
and
who
can
tell
whether
or
not
they
would’ve
obtained
profit
absent
one
or
more
of
these
restrictions.
and
it
is
the
fact
that
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
because
they
did
give
up
these
rights
voluntarily
to
accept
the
benefits
of
the
entire
program.
if
they
wanted
to
renounce,
they
should
renounce
the
whole
program
or
if
they
perhaps
if
they
had
come
to
the
defendants
in
the
way
that
your
honor
described,
we
would
not
be
here
today,
but
the
point
is
that
they
didn’t.
that
in
this
particular
case,
these
particular
plaintiffs
terminated
midas.
we
did
not
terminate
them.
what
they
wanted
was
not
relief
from
these
restrictions.
what
these
plaintiffs
wanted
was
still
more
franchise
agreements.
they
wanted
still
more
exclusive
territories.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
on
the
facts
that
he
could
--
he
thinks
he
could
show
that
he
could
make
more
money
absent
the
restriction.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
let
me
say
in
this
case
that
that
they
did
make
that
choice
when
they
terminated
midas.
they
went
into
a
program
sponsored
by
midas
competitors.
that
program
did
not
contain
these
allegedly
illegal
restrictions.
that
program
gave
them
the
exclusive
territories
for
the
whole
state
of
michigan
for
one,
for
all
of
washington
d.c.
for
another
and
that
program
did
not
prove
successful
and
it
was
only
then
that
they
brought
the
suit.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
the
defense
that
they
could
have
made
more
money
elsewhere?
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
think
it’s
enough.
if
they
participated
in
a
scheme
if
they
accepted
the
benefits
if
they
later
renounce
and
sued
claiming
that
they
could
have
made
more,
but
that’s
enough
to
apply
in
pari
delicto
irrespective
of
what
the
proof
might
have
been
as
to
what
they
could
have
done
elsewhere.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
don’t
--
i
didn’t
quite
comprehend
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
said
there
is
possibility
that
we
wouldn’t
be
here
because
that
is
not
the
facts
that
we
have
that
what
their
--
these
plaintiffs’
particular
objections
were
directed
to
were
not
the
restrictions
but
the
fact
that
we
didn’t
give
them
even
more
territories.
their
complaint,
paragraph
22m,
specifically
says
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs’
claims
for
damages
is
that
these
defendants
refused
the
repeated
request
of
the
plaintiffs
for
additional
franchises.
it
was
not
the
restrictions
to
which
they
were
objecting.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
think
that
there
is
both
a
factual
and
a
legal
distinction
of
simpson.
certainly
on
the
legal
grounds
there,
there
was
purely
consent
and
passive
acceptance
by
simpson
of
the
terms
imposed
by
union
oil
company.
there
was
not
the
participation
which
we
have
shown
here
by
simpson
in
the
terms
of
his
agreement
with
union
oil.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff,
mr.
max
ross
who
explained
that
these
dealers,
as
members
of
the
national
advisory
counsel,
which
were
the
top
ten
midas
dealers,
and
in
regional
and
national
dealer
meetings
as
the
elder
statesman
of
this
group
in
counseling
dealers,
discussed
all
aspects
of
this
program.
mr.
ross
specifically
said
that
these
were
very
comprehensive
discussions
lasting
from
morning
to
night.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
in
more
than
just
the
terms
in
developing
the
entire
concept
and
how
it
would
work.
as
the
other
distinction
is
concerned
that
there
of
course
factually
the
oil
company
had
terminated
the
dealer.
the
dealer
did
not
terminate
the
franchisor.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
in
this
case,
mr.
pierce
first
terminated
a
franchise
adamira
and
later
on
we
followed
up
with
terminations
of
the
rest
of
his
franchise
although
he
initiated
the
first
one
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
actually,
it
makes
a
difference
only
and
that
it
shows
that
these
plaintiffs
were
not
subject
to
the
restrictions.
it
wasn’t
the
restrictions
which
really
decided
the
issue.
they
were
voluntarily
getting
rid
of
midas.
they
thought
they
could
earn
more
in
another
program.
now
in
addition,
of
course,
the
comparison
in
size
and
equality
of
bargaining
power
between
a
corner
gas
station
and
union
oil
company
and
these
plaintiffs
and
midas,
which
at
the
time
we’re
talking
about,
were
selling
$5
million
in
total
sales,
not
midas
but
in
total
sales,
simply
doesn’t
match
up.
there’s
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
union
oil
and
the
court
rightly
said
there
that
this
implied
a
certain
lack
of
freedom
to
deal
on
the
part
of
the
dealer.
whereas
here,
i
think
we
have
shown
that
they
all
were
not
--
may
be
not
of
equal
bargaining
power
but
certainly
capable
of
bargaining
for
themselves
and
which
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
terminated
us
rather
than
our
terminating
them.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
think
that
the
fact
that
in
union
oil
and
simpson
and
all
the
gas
station
cases,
the
dealer
there
is
tied
to
the
oil
company,
to
the
supplier
by
a
lease
of
real
state
or
equipment
so
that
when
either
the
real
state
lease
is
terminated
or
the
sales
agreement
is
terminated,
that
dealer
is
out
of
business.
he
has
no
choice.
whereas
in
our
case,
there
is
no
lease
of
real
state;
there
is
no
lease
of
equipment.
and
as
shown
here,
the
dealers
did
continue
in
business
from
the
same
exact
places
selling
mufflers
and
other
additional
products
in
competition
with
midas
which
certainly
didn’t
happen
in
simpson.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
if
the
dealer,
if
you’re
talking
about
one
of
these
plaintiffs
and
that
were
the
only
circumstance,
i
think
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
pari
--
in
pari
delicto
as
to
the
reason
for
its
termination.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
well,
simpson,
mr.
justice
white,
was
the
mere
passive
acceptance
by
that
plaintiff,
by
that
dealer
of
the
conditions
laid
down.
that
is
not
the
fact
here.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
ross
explained
how
they
discussed
these
things
from
morning
to
night,
how
this
thing
was
a
program,
a
society,
an
affiliation
and
how
it
was
a
group
of
people
with
a
common
interest
in
mind
and
that
all
of
them
worked
together
to
develop
this
concept.
they
all
thought
again,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
exclusive
dealing
was
necessary.
it
is
not
much
different
from
the
situation
which
the
court
faced
in
united
states
versus
general
motors
in
the
los
angeles
situation
where
there,
it
was
the
dealers
who
initiated
the
boycott
against
the
sales
to
discounters
and
the
court
there
said
that
this
amounted
to
a
horizontal
conspiracy
among
the
dealers
and
the
company
so
that
if
you
followed
it
to
its
logical
conclusion,
general
motors
would
be
able
to
sue
the
dealers
for
that
violation.
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
would
want
to
come
to
that
result
and
yet
in
pari
delicto,
it
doesn’t
apply
in
this
case.
in
an
antitrust
cases,
the
result
is
reached
not
only
in
general
motors,
but
that
any
two
horizontal
price
fixers,
competitors
--
each
of
whom
gives
up
his
right
to
fix
his
prices
in
the
expectation
that
the
group
action
will
prove
profitable,
but
sue
the
other
because
the
other
does
not
comply
with
the
agreement.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
if
the
franchisee
here
can
sue
midas
for
the
exclusive
arrangement,
then
midas
can
sue
the
dealer
for
keeping
him
--
for
not
allowing
midas
to
put
other
dealers
in
that
territory
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
either
makes
more
effective
law
enforcement
or
makes
much
sense
economically
or
judicially.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
application
of
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
here
will
further
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws.
petitioners
have
urged
that
affirmance
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
mean
that
the
court
has
legitimate
ties
to
immunize
franchisees.
but
that
is
not
at
all
so.
that
is
not
our
position;
we
know
that
is
not
the
law.
the
true
victim,
the
true
person
who
enters
into
these
contracts
solely
because
it’s
the
only
one
available,
still
has
the
right
under
simpson
and
under
the
other
coercion
cases.
but
when
they
have
participated
to
the
extent
they
have
participated
here,
when
they
have
asked
for
additional
franchises,
when
they
have
met
and
decided
on
such
parts
of
the
program
as
prevention
of
wholesale
sales.
when,
as
mr.
ross
said,
“it’s
a
society,
it’s
a
group”,
then
you
don’t
have
that
situation.
and
we
think
that
those
people
who
participate
actively
in
these
violations
should
also
be
precluded
from
suing
under
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
not
the
mere
execution
of
the
franchise
arrangement
which
rendered
the
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto
here.
petitioners
own
authorities
recognize
that
there
is
a
place
for
in
pari
delicto
in
the
antitrust
laws.
the
authors
of
both
the
law
review
articles
which
the
petitioners
cite
in
both
of
their
briefs
indicate
that
in
pari
delicto
should
be
retained
as
a
defense
against
section
4
actions
in
order
to
discourage
persons
from
participating
in
illegal
activities.
denying
the
defense
will
encourage
them
to
remain
in
these
illegal
arrangements
and
to
enter
into
them
in
the
expectation
that
if
the
thing
doesn’t
work
out,
they
might
secure
treble
damages.
way
back
in
1899,
this
court
explained
in
mcmillan
v.
hoffman
that
if
parties’
two
illegal
arrangements
recognize
that
one
may
enter
into
them,
they
place
themselves
outside
the
protection
of
the
law,
the
less
inclined
will
they
be
to
enter
into
such
arrangements.
and
in
that
way,
the
public
will
secure
rigid
adherence
to
the
law.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
facts
here
--
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
we
say
that
for
purposes
of
in
pari
delicto
that
the
dealer
amounts
to
a
co-conspirator.
the
determination
of
a
substantive
liability
in
a
conspiracy
case
by
a
competitor
is
not
within
the
purview
of
our
contention
here,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
we
say
that
he
has
to
meet
those
three
requirements.
he
has
to
voluntarily
participate,
actively
promote
and
accept
the
benefits
and
then
sue
alleging
that
it
was
illegal
and
that
he
might
have
done
better
elsewhere,
only
under
those
circumstances
will
in
pari
delicto
apply.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
no,
but
certainly
the
facts
here
and
to
me
at
least
indicate
that
these
plaintiffs
would
have
mean
as
much
a
co-conspirator
as
were
the
gear
defendants
in
general
motors
in
the
los
angeles
boycott
case.
so
that
extent,
mr.
justice
white,
yes
i
think
that
they
could
be
properly
joined
if
i
were
suing
midas
as
a
competitor
of
midas.
and
after
all,
it
is
the
public
which
is
damaged
by
section
3
and
that
the
public
has
been
damaged
as
much
by
the
action
of
the
dealer
as
the
supplier,
certainly
the
dealer
should
be
held
responsible.
as
to
our
alternative
defense,
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
here
also
maintain
that
we
should
be
precluded
from
establishing
that
we
were
a
single
traitor.
here,
all
the
corporate
defendants
were
owned
by
nathan
and
gordon
sherman;
each
of
the
individual
defendants
operated
only
in
it's
corporate
capacity.
there
was
no
holding
out
of
separate
corporations.
midas
did
not
sell
any
goods
or
hire
any
people.
this
was
not
the
same
as
the
keeper-steward
situation
where
there
were
separate
divisions,
separate
executives
who
dealt
separately
with
the
plaintiffs.
this
was
purely
a
single
unit,
a
small
family
owned
business.
and
before
i
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
report,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
response
to
your
question
to
mr.
rolnick
that
the
figures
which
he
is
relying
on
here
are
contained
in
an
antitrust
complaint
filed
by
the
united
states
against
one
of
midas’
competitors
and
that
those
figures
indicate
sales,
total
sales
of
automotive
exhaust
products
in
the
united
states
of
sum
of
$160
million.
in
1955,
midas’
total
sales
or
international
parts
total
sales,
not
just
midas
sales
were
some
$5
million
which
means
that
most
we
were
around
3%
of
the
market.
his
complaint
alleges
that
we
tripled
our
sales
from
1955
to
the
time
that
this
case
was
decided
and
i
also
think
that
it’s
important
that
that
case
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
manufacturers
of
passenger
automobile
such
as
general
motors,
ford,
chrysler
and
studebaker
are
in
this
business,
are
particularly
in
the
installation
business.
and
although
it
doesn’t
reveal
any
figures
in
that
complaint
for
what
they
have
sold
or
what
their
dealers
sold,
saying
that
they
get
their
mufflers
from
some
of
midas’
competitors,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
these
large
companies
are
in
this
business,
makes
clear
that
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
enable
ourselves
to
compete
with
this
new
concept
and
with
this
new
idea.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
frankly,
i’m
not
sure.
i
think
what
they
do
is,
they
are
the
manufacturing
figures
of
the
companies
that
they
say
comprise
the
industry,
but
they
don’t
at
all
purport
to
deal
with
figures
for
installation
sales.
mr.
glenn
w.
mcgee
i
can’t
answer
that
and
i
can
answer
from
the
complaint
which
of
course
is
not
in
the
record.
finally,
we
think
that
the
case
is
right
for
summary
judgment.
we
don’t
believe
that
they
have
raised
any
issue
as
to
any
material
fact
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
section
--
of
rule
51e.
we
filed
an
affidavit
which
was
consisted
solely
of
their
testimony
in
the
court
below.
and
we
filed
an
affidavit
of
the
shamans,
which
was
not
contradicted.
throughout
the
proceedings
below,
they
did
not
challenge
the
statement
in
our
appendix
summarizing
the
plaintiffs’
testimony
nor
did
they
challenge
the
sherman
affidavit.
these
counsels
thoroughly,
familiar
with
both
the
rules
on
the
facts
by
assertions
have
said
that
there
are
factual
issues.
but
here
again,
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
there
are
no
citations
to
the
record.
there
are
no
indications
of
true
evidence
with
respect
to
the
issues
which
they
attempt
to
raise
respecting
coercion,
mr.
pierce’s
termination
and
our
conspiracy.
by
their
motion
to
the
district
court
to
secure
additional
discovery
only
on
the
matter
of
trademarks,
they
recognized
that
everything
necessary
for
this
decision
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court’s
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
