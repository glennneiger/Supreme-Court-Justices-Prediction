mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
treble
damage
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
standing
to
sue
in
as
much
as
it
said
they
were
in
pari
delicto
with
the
defendants
who
were
the
respondents
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
united
states,
the
seventh
--
the
court
of
appeals,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
cases
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
and
the
primary
issue
raised
by
the
writ
is
whether
a
franchisee,
who
accepts
a
franchise
agreement
which
is
prepared
and
offered
and
whose
terms
are
written
by
a
franchisor
is
barred
from
bringing
an
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
for
injuries
which
the
franchisee
has
sustained
as
a
result
of
antitrust
restraints
which
the
franchisor
has
written
into
the
franchise
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
said,
held
that
the
mere
entering
into
of
this
franchise
agreement
placed
the
antitrust
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto
with
the
defendants
and
barred
plaintiffs
from
bringing
the
action.
we
submit
that
in
making
this
ruling,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
committed
plain
error.
we
submit
that
in
pari
delicto
is
not
applicable
to
the
factual
context
of
this
litigation.
and
that
if
it
were
in
pari
delicto,
it
is
not
a
defense
to
a
claim
under
section
4.
in
order
to
understand
the
litigation,
it's
obviously
necessary
to
detail
the
facts
in
some
degree.
the
defendants
or
the
respondents
here
represent
a
complex
of
corporations,
a
parent
subsidiary
and
affiliates.
the
parent
corporation
was
organized
in
1938
and
was
engaged
from
1938
until
1955
primarily
in
the
wholesale
manufacture
and
or
distribution
of
automotive
exhaust
system
equipment
for
the
replacement
market.
in
1955,
when
the
acts
which
give
rise
to
this
litigation
occurred,
the
parent
and
its
subsidiaries,
business
volume
exceeded
$5
million.
they
were
a
very
substantial
factor
in
the
market
at
that
time.
in
order
to
expand
the
nature
of
their
business
however,
they
decided
to
initiate
a
franchise
program.
to
the
end
of
initiating
this
program,
they
originated
the
name
midas
which
they
proceeded
to
use
in
trademark
in
march
of
1955.
thereafter,
they
developed
a
franchise
concept.
the
franchise
concept
was
built
around
a
brand
identification
for
the
defendant’s
muffler
using
the
name
midas.
a
unique
lifetime
guarantee
for
that
muffler
under
which
the
parent
company
stood
behind
its
muffler
and
advised
the
public
through
a
massive
advertising
campaign
on
a
national
basis
that
the
muffler
was
good
for
the
life
of
the
car
if
it
blew
out
or
rusted
out
for
some
reason
during
the
life
of
the
car
--
during
the
life
that
you
owned
the
car
that
they
would
replace
the
muffler
free
of
charge.
in
their
advertising,
the
franchise
were
featured,
this
lifetime
guarantee
rapid
free
15-minute
installation.
indeed,
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
a
replacement
part
product
for
an
automobile
that
a
consumer
campaign
had
put
on
--
had
been
put
on
to
develop
a
demand
for
this
particular
product.
having
created
the
concept,
the
parent
company
then
proceeded
to
organize
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
by
the
name
of
midas,
inc.
in
19
--
late
1955
and
then
went
about
the
job
of
finding
franchisees.
principally,
in
this
litigation
there
are
four
petitioners,
all
of
whom
were
franchisees.
three
of
these
franchisees
originally
were
customers
of
the
parent
corporation
international
parts.
the
fourth
franchisee
became
aware
of
the
franchise
program
through
an
advertisement
to
which
he
responded.
one
of
the
--
all
four
accepted
franchises.
one
of
the
franchisees
accepted
the
franchise
only
after
he
was
advised
that
unless
he
did
he
would
be
subjected
to
competition
from
anyone
that
the
parent
company
would
franchise
in
that
area
and
also
with
the
threat
that
the
parent
company
would
discontinue
selling
it's
international
brand
muffler,
which
that
franchisee
had
carried
in
its
place
of
business
prior
to
this
time.
now,
the
franchises
which
these
petitioners
accepted
contained
in
their
expressed
terms
provisions
which
required
the
franchisee
to
maintain
the
price
which
the
franchise
owner
established.
there
was
a
provision
in
this
franchise
agreement
which
also
required
the
franchiser
or
the
franchisee
--
excuse
me,
to
purchase
exclusively
from
the
franchisor.
in
other
words,
the
franchisee
was
to
handle
no
other
muffler
but
the
respondents'
midas
muffler
and
indeed
he
was
not
to
purchase
any
exhaust
system
parts
from
anyone
other
than
the
franchisee
--
the
franchisor
and
this
included
such
exhaust
system
parts,
its
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes,
clamps
and
a
whole
host
of
other
items
which
were
essential
in
the
installation
of
an
automotive
exhaust
system.
these
items
aside
from
the
muffler
were
not
trademarked.
now
soon
after
the
franchisees
has
accepted
their
agreements
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
recess
yesterday,
i
was
at
the
point
where
i
had
described
how
the
respondents
had
originated
their
franchise
program
and
formulated
a
franchise
agreement.
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
which,
franchisees
were
required
to
maintain
resale
prices,
purchased
type
products,
deal
exclusively
with
the
franchisor
and
indeed
it
also
provided
that
they
were
subject
to
certain
other
territorial
restraints.
these
provisions
were
backed
up
by
a
30-day
cancellation
provision.
during
the
life
of
the
franchisers
in
question,
the
franchisor
enforced
the
terms
of
these
agreements
rigorously.
the
details
of
that
enforcement
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
beginning
at
page
175.
indeed,
the
enforcement
was
so
rigorous
that
the
respondents
terminated
one
of
the
petitioners
herein
after
a
series
of
warnings
to
him
that
he
was
not
purchasing
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes
and
clamps
which
they
sold
from
midas,
but
was
rather
--
was
instead
purchasing
them
from
competitors
who
offered
these
parts
for
sale
and
prices
which
were
substantially
below
the
prices
at
which
respondent
sold
these
products.
indeed,
during
the
course
of
those
warnings,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
one
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
respondents
and
this
petitioner
in
which
the
principal
officer
said,
“you
know,
your
franchise
is
like
a
marriage.
this
is
like
cheating
on
your
wife
and
it
is
grounds
for
divorce,”
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
had
purchase
from
outside
sources.
following
this
termination,
this
petitioner,
joined
by
the
three
other
petitioners,
initiated
this
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
northern
division.
in
that
action,
the
petitioners
alleged
that
they
were
injured
as
a
result
of
having
been
compelled
to
adhere
and
adhere
strictly
to
the
restrictive
provisions
in
these
agreements.
they
alleged
that
these
restrictive
provisions
represented
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
we
submit
that
it
was
the
plainest
kind
of
error
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
this
action
which
had
been
brought
by
these
petitioners.
the
district
court
applied
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
delicto,
the
doctrine
that
these
petitioners
were
at
equal
fault.
we
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine
is
not
applicable
and
indeed,
we
submit
that
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
any
action
brought
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case
when
it
is
examined
in
light
of
the
restrictions
which
the
respondents
imposed.
these
restrictions
were
of
no
benefit
to
the
respondents
--
to
the
petitioners.
they
were
in
fact
of
sole
benefit,
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
to
the
respondents.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
for
example
how
the
petitioners
could
have
profited
or
benefited
from
the
fact
that
they
were
forced,
forced
to
pay
more
for
parts
which
they
purchased
from
the
respondents
and
they
would
have
paid
--
had
they
purchased
these
parts
from
respondents
competitors.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
exclusive
territories
were
of
benefit
to
the
extent
that
they
authorized
the
petitioner
to
sell
the
respondents’
nationally
advertised
muffler.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
with
no
competition
in
that
territory.
on
the
other
hand,
in
meeting
out
the
territories,
what
the
respondents
did
was
limit
the
area
within
which
the
petitioner
could
sell
this
midas
muffler.
now,
one
has
to
remember
that
these
midas
mufflers
were
purchased
by
the
petitioner
and
that
this
limitation
on
territory
represented
an
alienation
on
the
restraint
--
an
alienation
restraining
the
territory
within
which
these
petitioners
could
sell
merchandise
which
they
had
in
fact
purchased
and
paid
for.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
purchase
of
the
muffler
was
a
benefit.
the
right
to
sell
the
muffler
was
a
benefit
and
i
believe
that
was
independent
of
the
territorial
restriction.
it
was
the
muffler
which
we
chose
to
sell.
it
was
the
muffler
which
carry
with
it
the
national
advertising
and
the
consumer
demand
which
in
fact
made
it
pre-sold
and
it
was
this
that
we
chose
to
sell.
the
territory
happened
to
be
something
which
was
of
benefit
to
the
respondents
because
they
limited
the
area,
and
by
limiting
the
area
could
presumably
have
more
franchisees.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
these
franchisers
were
very
profitable
franchises.
they
could
have
been
and
would
have
been
much
more
profitable
had
they
not
been
subjected
to
the
exclusive
dealing,
tying
and
place
fixing
restraints.
the
profit
was
derived
independently
of
the
restraints.
the
profit
did
not
arise
out
of
the
restraint.
the
profit
arose
exclusively
out
of
the
sale
of
the
midas
muffler
which
is
i
say,
carried
a
very
unique
guarantee
and
a
vast
amount
of
national
advertising.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
midas.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
at
that
time
he
entered
--
these
particular
petitioners
entered
into
these
franchise
agreement,
there
was
no
other
franchise
system
which
had
been
developed
for
sale
of
mufflers.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
any
particular
petitioner
could
have
entered
into
the
retail
sale
and
installation
of
mufflers
without
entering
into
a
franchise
arrangement
which
the
respondents
offered.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
operate
in
the
marketplace
but
he
would
not
have
had
a
nationally
advertised
muffler
with
a
unique
lifetime
guarantee
which
was
--
which
--
under
which
the
purchaser
could
replace
that
muffler
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
number
5.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
had
11%
of
the
market.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
were,
and
this
isn’t
in
the
record,
there
were
four
other
companies;
two
or
three
of
which
were
approximately
the
size
of
midas
or
a
little
larger,
one
of
which
was
substantially
much
larger
with
40%
or
50%
of
the
market.
none
of
these
companies,
however,
had
the
type
of
guarantee
which
these
respondents
offered
and
it
was
the
romance
of
this
guarantee
which
was
advertised
on
a
national
scale
with
over
$3.5
million
worth
of
national
advertising
which
created
the
demand
which
made
this
a
profitable
franchise.
without
this
advertising
and
without
this
guarantee,
i
doubt
and
doubt
very
seriously
whether
anyone
could
have
entered
this
business
and
profited
from
it.
there
is
one
more
point
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
other
companies
sell
their
mufflers
to
automobile
dealers,
to
gasoline
stations
and
that
type
of
thing
--
that
type
buyer
--
few
of
any
of
them
sold
them
to
exclusively
muffler
installation
shops.
this
was
the
concept
and
this
was
the
concept
which
respondents
developed
through
national
advertising.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
consists
of
a
multiplicity
of
factors,
one
of
which
is
that
this
again
is
the
one
that
had
the
national
advertising.
the
other
factor,
i
think,
is
the
position
that
we
take
that
the
restrictive
provisions
in
this
agreement
were
not
essential
to
the
franchise
and
to
the
franchise
concept.
indeed
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
franchise
concept.
these
restrictive
provisions
were
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
respondents
so
that
the
respondents
could
feather
their
own
nest
so
to
speak.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
well,
i
think
it
has
this
to
do
with
pari
delicto
and
that
is
that
in
as
much
as
the
petitioners
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
formulation
of
his
program,
they
cannot
be
considered
equally
a
fault
by
having
done
no
more
than
accept
the
program
which
the
respondent
espoused.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
a
formulation.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
i
would
--
if
there
is
a
pari
delicto
doctrine
applicable
to
this
kind
of
action,
i
would
find
it
to
a
true
co-conspiracy
case
where
the
conspirators
divided
up
the
market
amongst
themselves.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
statement
was
made
earlier
that
these
petitioners
cooperated
with
the
respondents
and
the
enforcement
or
in
the
publication
of
these
restrictive
arrangements.
now,
this
just
isn’t
so.
it
is
inaccurate
and
the
record
doesn’t
bear
that
out.
the
record
is
plain,
absolutely
plain
that
these
petitioners
were
coerced
into
buying
exclusively
from
the
respondents.
at
page
194
in
the
record,
there
is
a
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
were
offered
the
franchise
which
contained
an
exclusive
territory
and
they
had
the
freedom
either
to
accept
the
exclusive
territory
as
it
was
proposed
or
reject
it.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
exclusive
territory
was
a
benefit.
the
limitation
upon
the
exclusive
territory
was
a
detriment.
the
right
to
sell
this
muffler
per
se
was
a
benefit
because
it
carried
with
it
again
national
advertising
but
the
restriction
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
that
is
absolutely
true
your
honor,
but
the
territory
which
was
granted
was
restricted
and
this
restriction
on
the
territory
which
constituted
the
detriment.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
i
will
claim
damages
from
the
price
fixing,
exclusive
dealing,
the
tying
and
if
we
can
prove
damages
from
the
territorial
arrangement,
we
will
allege
damages
with
respect
to
that
too,
but
our
primary
claims
are
based
on
exclusive
dealing,
tying
and
place
fixing.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
it
possibly
could
but
they
haven’t
done
so.
there
was
a
reference
in
argument
to
the
fact
that
we
cooperated
in
formulating
this
plan
and
the
reference
was
to
a
national
advisory
council.
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
national
advisory
council
was
created
22
months,
22
months
after.
this
franchise
agreement
was
offered
and
accepted
by
any
of
the
petitioners
here
and
at
the
time
that
franchise
agreement
was
accepted
--
the
time
it
was
accepted,
these
very
restrictions
were
in
the
agreement.
that
national
advisory
council
didn’t
discuss
the
restrictions
that
were
in
this
agreement.
they
didn’t
promulgate
these
restrictions.
what
the
national
advisory
council
discussed
and
what
the
record
shows
they
discussed
was
how
to
increase
your
sales?
what
kind
of
advertising
to
use?
what
kind
of
people
to
employ?
they
didn’t
discuss
whether
we
should
buy
exclusively
from
midas.
they
didn’t
discuss
whether
we
should
maintain
prices
fixed
by
midas.
they
discussed
the
plain
everyday
operation
of
the
midas
muffler
shop.
now,
there
was
a
reference,
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
the
complaint
in
the
ap
parts
case
and
the
extent
of
the
market.
and
the
complaint
there
reads,
paragraph
14
and
i
think
it’s
plain
from
the
complaint
what
the
scope
of
the
market
is,
“the
gorlick
group
is
the
largest
supplier
of
automotive
exhaust
systems
and
parts
for
the
replacement
trade
accounting
from
more
than
42%
of
a
total
dollar
volume
of
such
manufacture
and
sale
in
1959.”
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
comparison
of
mr.
mcgee
made
was
between
1959
sales
or
$160
million
in
1955
sales
of
$5
million
when
an
accurate
comparison
should
be
a
$160
million
in
1959
against
$17
million
by
the
respondents,
which
makes
approximately
11%
of
the
market.
during
the
same
year,
walker
manufacturing
company,
meremade
automotive
and
international
parts
corporation,
accounted
for
approximately
22%,
13%
and
11%
respectively.
approximately
95%
of
orban
industries
exhaust
systems
and
parts
sold
for
the
replacement
trade
in
that
year
were
sold
by
orban
to
automobile
manufacturers.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint
where
the
government
carefully
showed
the
sales
to
automotive
manufacturers
that
this
encompasses
the
entire
market.
simpson
versus
union
oil
which
was
referred
to
is
directly
applicable
to
the
present
situation.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
a
franchisee
had
standing
to
sue.
we
think
we
have
the
same
standing.
we
have
done
nothing
more,
nothing
more
than
accept
the
restrictions
which
these
franchisors
placed
in
their
agreements
to
start
with
and
we
submit
they
had
no
right
to
tie
these
restrictions
to
the
sale
of
their
midas
muffler
and
that
in
fact
is
what
they
did.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
restrictions
are
resale
price
maintenance
which
applied
to
trademarks
as
well
as
non-trademarks
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes
and
clamps.
in
other
words,
they
required
as
to
maintain
the
price.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
required
us
to
purchase
clamps
and
maintain
the
price
on
them
despite
the
fact
that
those
parts
were
not
trademarked
and
were
readily
available
from
other
sources
of
supply.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
midas
muffler.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
entirely
separate
and
distinct.
now,
as
i
said,
simpson
versus
union
oil
is
directly
applicable.
we
did
nothing
more
than
to
accept
these
franchises
with
the
restrictions
which
they
imposed.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
restrictions.
i
think
the
necessity
for
allowing
this
type
of
action
is
well-stated
in
our
petition
for
writ
in
which
we
said
and
i
think
it
sums
up
our
theory
behind
this.
i
see
my
time
is
up
so
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
drastic
implications
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
holding
can
be
partially
measured
by
reference
to
its
perspective
application
to
franchising,
which
is
one
of
the
most
rapidly
going
methods
of
distribution
today
in
the
united
states.
franchising
is
currently
a
$70
billion
a
year
industry
with
450,000
franchisees.
the
point
being
that
if
the
franchisors
are
allowed
to
use
their
agreement
as
a
shield
to
protect
themselves,
they
have
the
ability
to
enforce
restrictions
which
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
claiming
later
that
the
signature
to
that
agreement
constituted
consent
or
in
pari
delicto.
we
do
not
think
this
proposition
can
stand.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
treble
damage
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
standing
to
sue
in
as
much
as
it
said
they
were
in
pari
delicto
with
the
defendants
who
were
the
respondents
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
united
states,
the
seventh
--
the
court
of
appeals,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
cases
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
and
the
primary
issue
raised
by
the
writ
is
whether
a
franchisee,
who
accepts
a
franchise
agreement
which
is
prepared
and
offered
and
whose
terms
are
written
by
a
franchisor
is
barred
from
bringing
an
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
for
injuries
which
the
franchisee
has
sustained
as
a
result
of
antitrust
restraints
which
the
franchisor
has
written
into
the
franchise
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
said,
held
that
the
mere
entering
into
of
this
franchise
agreement
placed
the
antitrust
plaintiffs
in
pari
delicto
with
the
defendants
and
barred
plaintiffs
from
bringing
the
action.
we
submit
that
in
making
this
ruling,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
committed
plain
error.
we
submit
that
in
pari
delicto
is
not
applicable
to
the
factual
context
of
this
litigation.
and
that
if
it
were
in
pari
delicto,
it
is
not
a
defense
to
a
claim
under
section
4.
in
order
to
understand
the
litigation,
it's
obviously
necessary
to
detail
the
facts
in
some
degree.
the
defendants
or
the
respondents
here
represent
a
complex
of
corporations,
a
parent
subsidiary
and
affiliates.
the
parent
corporation
was
organized
in
1938
and
was
engaged
from
1938
until
1955
primarily
in
the
wholesale
manufacture
and
or
distribution
of
automotive
exhaust
system
equipment
for
the
replacement
market.
in
1955,
when
the
acts
which
give
rise
to
this
litigation
occurred,
the
parent
and
its
subsidiaries,
business
volume
exceeded
$5
million.
they
were
a
very
substantial
factor
in
the
market
at
that
time.
in
order
to
expand
the
nature
of
their
business
however,
they
decided
to
initiate
a
franchise
program.
to
the
end
of
initiating
this
program,
they
originated
the
name
midas
which
they
proceeded
to
use
in
trademark
in
march
of
1955.
thereafter,
they
developed
a
franchise
concept.
the
franchise
concept
was
built
around
a
brand
identification
for
the
defendant’s
muffler
using
the
name
midas.
a
unique
lifetime
guarantee
for
that
muffler
under
which
the
parent
company
stood
behind
its
muffler
and
advised
the
public
through
a
massive
advertising
campaign
on
a
national
basis
that
the
muffler
was
good
for
the
life
of
the
car
if
it
blew
out
or
rusted
out
for
some
reason
during
the
life
of
the
car
--
during
the
life
that
you
owned
the
car
that
they
would
replace
the
muffler
free
of
charge.
in
their
advertising,
the
franchise
were
featured,
this
lifetime
guarantee
rapid
free
15-minute
installation.
indeed,
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
a
replacement
part
product
for
an
automobile
that
a
consumer
campaign
had
put
on
--
had
been
put
on
to
develop
a
demand
for
this
particular
product.
having
created
the
concept,
the
parent
company
then
proceeded
to
organize
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
by
the
name
of
midas,
inc.
in
19
--
late
1955
and
then
went
about
the
job
of
finding
franchisees.
principally,
in
this
litigation
there
are
four
petitioners,
all
of
whom
were
franchisees.
three
of
these
franchisees
originally
were
customers
of
the
parent
corporation
international
parts.
the
fourth
franchisee
became
aware
of
the
franchise
program
through
an
advertisement
to
which
he
responded.
one
of
the
--
all
four
accepted
franchises.
one
of
the
franchisees
accepted
the
franchise
only
after
he
was
advised
that
unless
he
did
he
would
be
subjected
to
competition
from
anyone
that
the
parent
company
would
franchise
in
that
area
and
also
with
the
threat
that
the
parent
company
would
discontinue
selling
it's
international
brand
muffler,
which
that
franchisee
had
carried
in
its
place
of
business
prior
to
this
time.
now,
the
franchises
which
these
petitioners
accepted
contained
in
their
expressed
terms
provisions
which
required
the
franchisee
to
maintain
the
price
which
the
franchise
owner
established.
there
was
a
provision
in
this
franchise
agreement
which
also
required
the
franchiser
or
the
franchisee
--
excuse
me,
to
purchase
exclusively
from
the
franchisor.
in
other
words,
the
franchisee
was
to
handle
no
other
muffler
but
the
respondents'
midas
muffler
and
indeed
he
was
not
to
purchase
any
exhaust
system
parts
from
anyone
other
than
the
franchisee
--
the
franchisor
and
this
included
such
exhaust
system
parts,
its
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes,
clamps
and
a
whole
host
of
other
items
which
were
essential
in
the
installation
of
an
automotive
exhaust
system.
these
items
aside
from
the
muffler
were
not
trademarked.
now
soon
after
the
franchisees
has
accepted
their
agreements
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
recess
yesterday,
i
was
at
the
point
where
i
had
described
how
the
respondents
had
originated
their
franchise
program
and
formulated
a
franchise
agreement.
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
which,
franchisees
were
required
to
maintain
resale
prices,
purchased
type
products,
deal
exclusively
with
the
franchisor
and
indeed
it
also
provided
that
they
were
subject
to
certain
other
territorial
restraints.
these
provisions
were
backed
up
by
a
30-day
cancellation
provision.
during
the
life
of
the
franchisers
in
question,
the
franchisor
enforced
the
terms
of
these
agreements
rigorously.
the
details
of
that
enforcement
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
beginning
at
page
175.
indeed,
the
enforcement
was
so
rigorous
that
the
respondents
terminated
one
of
the
petitioners
herein
after
a
series
of
warnings
to
him
that
he
was
not
purchasing
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes
and
clamps
which
they
sold
from
midas,
but
was
rather
--
was
instead
purchasing
them
from
competitors
who
offered
these
parts
for
sale
and
prices
which
were
substantially
below
the
prices
at
which
respondent
sold
these
products.
indeed,
during
the
course
of
those
warnings,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
one
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
respondents
and
this
petitioner
in
which
the
principal
officer
said,
“you
know,
your
franchise
is
like
a
marriage.
this
is
like
cheating
on
your
wife
and
it
is
grounds
for
divorce,”
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
had
purchase
from
outside
sources.
following
this
termination,
this
petitioner,
joined
by
the
three
other
petitioners,
initiated
this
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
northern
division.
in
that
action,
the
petitioners
alleged
that
they
were
injured
as
a
result
of
having
been
compelled
to
adhere
and
adhere
strictly
to
the
restrictive
provisions
in
these
agreements.
they
alleged
that
these
restrictive
provisions
represented
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
we
submit
that
it
was
the
plainest
kind
of
error
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
this
action
which
had
been
brought
by
these
petitioners.
the
district
court
applied
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
delicto,
the
doctrine
that
these
petitioners
were
at
equal
fault.
we
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine
is
not
applicable
and
indeed,
we
submit
that
the
in
pari
delicto
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
any
action
brought
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case
when
it
is
examined
in
light
of
the
restrictions
which
the
respondents
imposed.
these
restrictions
were
of
no
benefit
to
the
respondents
--
to
the
petitioners.
they
were
in
fact
of
sole
benefit,
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
to
the
respondents.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
for
example
how
the
petitioners
could
have
profited
or
benefited
from
the
fact
that
they
were
forced,
forced
to
pay
more
for
parts
which
they
purchased
from
the
respondents
and
they
would
have
paid
--
had
they
purchased
these
parts
from
respondents
competitors.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
exclusive
territories
were
of
benefit
to
the
extent
that
they
authorized
the
petitioner
to
sell
the
respondents’
nationally
advertised
muffler.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
with
no
competition
in
that
territory.
on
the
other
hand,
in
meeting
out
the
territories,
what
the
respondents
did
was
limit
the
area
within
which
the
petitioner
could
sell
this
midas
muffler.
now,
one
has
to
remember
that
these
midas
mufflers
were
purchased
by
the
petitioner
and
that
this
limitation
on
territory
represented
an
alienation
on
the
restraint
--
an
alienation
restraining
the
territory
within
which
these
petitioners
could
sell
merchandise
which
they
had
in
fact
purchased
and
paid
for.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
purchase
of
the
muffler
was
a
benefit.
the
right
to
sell
the
muffler
was
a
benefit
and
i
believe
that
was
independent
of
the
territorial
restriction.
it
was
the
muffler
which
we
chose
to
sell.
it
was
the
muffler
which
carry
with
it
the
national
advertising
and
the
consumer
demand
which
in
fact
made
it
pre-sold
and
it
was
this
that
we
chose
to
sell.
the
territory
happened
to
be
something
which
was
of
benefit
to
the
respondents
because
they
limited
the
area,
and
by
limiting
the
area
could
presumably
have
more
franchisees.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
these
franchisers
were
very
profitable
franchises.
they
could
have
been
and
would
have
been
much
more
profitable
had
they
not
been
subjected
to
the
exclusive
dealing,
tying
and
place
fixing
restraints.
the
profit
was
derived
independently
of
the
restraints.
the
profit
did
not
arise
out
of
the
restraint.
the
profit
arose
exclusively
out
of
the
sale
of
the
midas
muffler
which
is
i
say,
carried
a
very
unique
guarantee
and
a
vast
amount
of
national
advertising.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
midas.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
at
that
time
he
entered
--
these
particular
petitioners
entered
into
these
franchise
agreement,
there
was
no
other
franchise
system
which
had
been
developed
for
sale
of
mufflers.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
any
particular
petitioner
could
have
entered
into
the
retail
sale
and
installation
of
mufflers
without
entering
into
a
franchise
arrangement
which
the
respondents
offered.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
operate
in
the
marketplace
but
he
would
not
have
had
a
nationally
advertised
muffler
with
a
unique
lifetime
guarantee
which
was
--
which
--
under
which
the
purchaser
could
replace
that
muffler
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
number
5.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
had
11%
of
the
market.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
were,
and
this
isn’t
in
the
record,
there
were
four
other
companies;
two
or
three
of
which
were
approximately
the
size
of
midas
or
a
little
larger,
one
of
which
was
substantially
much
larger
with
40%
or
50%
of
the
market.
none
of
these
companies,
however,
had
the
type
of
guarantee
which
these
respondents
offered
and
it
was
the
romance
of
this
guarantee
which
was
advertised
on
a
national
scale
with
over
$3.5
million
worth
of
national
advertising
which
created
the
demand
which
made
this
a
profitable
franchise.
without
this
advertising
and
without
this
guarantee,
i
doubt
and
doubt
very
seriously
whether
anyone
could
have
entered
this
business
and
profited
from
it.
there
is
one
more
point
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
other
companies
sell
their
mufflers
to
automobile
dealers,
to
gasoline
stations
and
that
type
of
thing
--
that
type
buyer
--
few
of
any
of
them
sold
them
to
exclusively
muffler
installation
shops.
this
was
the
concept
and
this
was
the
concept
which
respondents
developed
through
national
advertising.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
consists
of
a
multiplicity
of
factors,
one
of
which
is
that
this
again
is
the
one
that
had
the
national
advertising.
the
other
factor,
i
think,
is
the
position
that
we
take
that
the
restrictive
provisions
in
this
agreement
were
not
essential
to
the
franchise
and
to
the
franchise
concept.
indeed
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
franchise
concept.
these
restrictive
provisions
were
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
respondents
so
that
the
respondents
could
feather
their
own
nest
so
to
speak.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
well,
i
think
it
has
this
to
do
with
pari
delicto
and
that
is
that
in
as
much
as
the
petitioners
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
formulation
of
his
program,
they
cannot
be
considered
equally
a
fault
by
having
done
no
more
than
accept
the
program
which
the
respondent
espoused.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
a
formulation.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
i
would
--
if
there
is
a
pari
delicto
doctrine
applicable
to
this
kind
of
action,
i
would
find
it
to
a
true
co-conspiracy
case
where
the
conspirators
divided
up
the
market
amongst
themselves.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
statement
was
made
earlier
that
these
petitioners
cooperated
with
the
respondents
and
the
enforcement
or
in
the
publication
of
these
restrictive
arrangements.
now,
this
just
isn’t
so.
it
is
inaccurate
and
the
record
doesn’t
bear
that
out.
the
record
is
plain,
absolutely
plain
that
these
petitioners
were
coerced
into
buying
exclusively
from
the
respondents.
at
page
194
in
the
record,
there
is
a
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
were
offered
the
franchise
which
contained
an
exclusive
territory
and
they
had
the
freedom
either
to
accept
the
exclusive
territory
as
it
was
proposed
or
reject
it.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
exclusive
territory
was
a
benefit.
the
limitation
upon
the
exclusive
territory
was
a
detriment.
the
right
to
sell
this
muffler
per
se
was
a
benefit
because
it
carried
with
it
again
national
advertising
but
the
restriction
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
that
is
absolutely
true
your
honor,
but
the
territory
which
was
granted
was
restricted
and
this
restriction
on
the
territory
which
constituted
the
detriment.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
i
will
claim
damages
from
the
price
fixing,
exclusive
dealing,
the
tying
and
if
we
can
prove
damages
from
the
territorial
arrangement,
we
will
allege
damages
with
respect
to
that
too,
but
our
primary
claims
are
based
on
exclusive
dealing,
tying
and
place
fixing.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
it
possibly
could
but
they
haven’t
done
so.
there
was
a
reference
in
argument
to
the
fact
that
we
cooperated
in
formulating
this
plan
and
the
reference
was
to
a
national
advisory
council.
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
national
advisory
council
was
created
22
months,
22
months
after.
this
franchise
agreement
was
offered
and
accepted
by
any
of
the
petitioners
here
and
at
the
time
that
franchise
agreement
was
accepted
--
the
time
it
was
accepted,
these
very
restrictions
were
in
the
agreement.
that
national
advisory
council
didn’t
discuss
the
restrictions
that
were
in
this
agreement.
they
didn’t
promulgate
these
restrictions.
what
the
national
advisory
council
discussed
and
what
the
record
shows
they
discussed
was
how
to
increase
your
sales?
what
kind
of
advertising
to
use?
what
kind
of
people
to
employ?
they
didn’t
discuss
whether
we
should
buy
exclusively
from
midas.
they
didn’t
discuss
whether
we
should
maintain
prices
fixed
by
midas.
they
discussed
the
plain
everyday
operation
of
the
midas
muffler
shop.
now,
there
was
a
reference,
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
the
complaint
in
the
ap
parts
case
and
the
extent
of
the
market.
and
the
complaint
there
reads,
paragraph
14
and
i
think
it’s
plain
from
the
complaint
what
the
scope
of
the
market
is,
“the
gorlick
group
is
the
largest
supplier
of
automotive
exhaust
systems
and
parts
for
the
replacement
trade
accounting
from
more
than
42%
of
a
total
dollar
volume
of
such
manufacture
and
sale
in
1959.”
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
comparison
of
mr.
mcgee
made
was
between
1959
sales
or
$160
million
in
1955
sales
of
$5
million
when
an
accurate
comparison
should
be
a
$160
million
in
1959
against
$17
million
by
the
respondents,
which
makes
approximately
11%
of
the
market.
during
the
same
year,
walker
manufacturing
company,
meremade
automotive
and
international
parts
corporation,
accounted
for
approximately
22%,
13%
and
11%
respectively.
approximately
95%
of
orban
industries
exhaust
systems
and
parts
sold
for
the
replacement
trade
in
that
year
were
sold
by
orban
to
automobile
manufacturers.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint
where
the
government
carefully
showed
the
sales
to
automotive
manufacturers
that
this
encompasses
the
entire
market.
simpson
versus
union
oil
which
was
referred
to
is
directly
applicable
to
the
present
situation.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
a
franchisee
had
standing
to
sue.
we
think
we
have
the
same
standing.
we
have
done
nothing
more,
nothing
more
than
accept
the
restrictions
which
these
franchisors
placed
in
their
agreements
to
start
with
and
we
submit
they
had
no
right
to
tie
these
restrictions
to
the
sale
of
their
midas
muffler
and
that
in
fact
is
what
they
did.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
restrictions
are
resale
price
maintenance
which
applied
to
trademarks
as
well
as
non-trademarks
tail
pipes,
exhaust
pipes
and
clamps.
in
other
words,
they
required
as
to
maintain
the
price.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
they
required
us
to
purchase
clamps
and
maintain
the
price
on
them
despite
the
fact
that
those
parts
were
not
trademarked
and
were
readily
available
from
other
sources
of
supply.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
midas
muffler.
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
entirely
separate
and
distinct.
now,
as
i
said,
simpson
versus
union
oil
is
directly
applicable.
we
did
nothing
more
than
to
accept
these
franchises
with
the
restrictions
which
they
imposed.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
restrictions.
i
think
the
necessity
for
allowing
this
type
of
action
is
well-stated
in
our
petition
for
writ
in
which
we
said
and
i
think
it
sums
up
our
theory
behind
this.
i
see
my
time
is
up
so
--
mr.
robert
f.
rolnick
the
drastic
implications
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
holding
can
be
partially
measured
by
reference
to
its
perspective
application
to
franchising,
which
is
one
of
the
most
rapidly
going
methods
of
distribution
today
in
the
united
states.
franchising
is
currently
a
$70
billion
a
year
industry
with
450,000
franchisees.
the
point
being
that
if
the
franchisors
are
allowed
to
use
their
agreement
as
a
shield
to
protect
themselves,
they
have
the
ability
to
enforce
restrictions
which
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
claiming
later
that
the
signature
to
that
agreement
constituted
consent
or
in
pari
delicto.
we
do
not
think
this
proposition
can
stand.
thank
you.
