it?
it
was
because
they
disobeyed
the
court
order,
they
should
be
found
guilty.
justice

and
a

is
one
of
those

well,
permanently
at
rest.
justice
potter
stewart
that
one
that
has
the
potential
that
began
moving
in
the
next
few
seconds
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
there
--
do
they
--
what
happens
to
these
people,
does
the
labor
dispute
over
and
they
--
justice

(voice

and
that's
not
a
pending
contempt
proceeding.
justice

stewart
(voice

they
haven't
served
any
part
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
they
saw
a
bullet
hole
in
this
--
in
the
back
of
this
car?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
earlier
shooting
had
there
been
exchange
of
shots?
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
shot
fired
into
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
--
where
those
his
words,
this
shooting
episode
took
place?
it
doesn't
sound
like
there
are
many
sheriffs
in
tennessee?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
he
did
say,
in
other
words,
i'm
interested
in
the
bullet
hole?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
kind
of
old
car.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--see
that
in
the
record
but
there
was
there
anything
about
this
shooting
episode
as
you
call
it
would
being
described
as
an
exchange
of
shots
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
along
with
a
simple
a
stray
shot
from
somebody
in
an
automobile
into
a
house?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
as
i
understand
it,
the
word
episode
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
secondly,
it's
--
i
don't
think
we
can
in
normal
expectation
about
anything
you
can
have
a
shot
fired
from
moving
automobile
into
a
house
or
you
can
have
an
exchange
of
gun
fire
and
i
wonder
if
there
was
anything
in
this
record
showing
that
these
people
knew
that
there
has
been
an
exchange
of
gun
fire.
in
short,
i'm
wondering
if
the
presence
of
that
bullet
hole
in
the
back
of
the
car
helps
the
case
for
probable
cause
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
why?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
by
criminal
information
or
criminal
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
one
that
subsequently
been
nolle?
