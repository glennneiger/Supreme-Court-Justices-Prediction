justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
do
about
cheff?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
you
have
a
contempt,
was
that
indictable
at
the
common
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
saying
then
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
offense
for
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted
and
looked
to
the
act
itself
and
because
the
act
itself
involves
shooting
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
was
indictable
--
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
quite
for
--
for
me.
it
is
with
regardless
when
that
is
said
here
the
conviction
was
for
contempt
not
for
the
shooting.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
the
penalty
for
shoot
--
for
this
kind
of
shooting
on
the
tennessee
law
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
tennessee
law
of
person
who
would
be
--
he'd
be
indicted
for
that
offense
and
he'd
be
entitled
to
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
tennessee
law
he's
entitled
to
12-men
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
and
requires
the
unanimous
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
we
ought
to
disregard
the
fact
that
this
is
a
contempt
that
carries
a
quite
a
different
much
less
severe
penalty
and
look
back
to
the
nature
of
the
act
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
police
had
examined
the
automobile
just
when
they
stopped
it
for
wreck
and
circumstance
you
described?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
they
made
the
arrest
for
--
stop
the
car
and
make
the
arrest
for
reckless
driving
they
then
examined
the
car
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
pull
off
the
gun?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
here
they
found
--
the
occupant
could
reach
this.
it's
right
under
the
front
seat.
your
complaint
here
is
solely
that
the
car
come
to
arrest
in
front
of
the
police
station.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not
for
reckless
driving?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
--
i'm
sorry,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
got
your
answer
not
that
i
want
to
pressure
but
the
police
stopped
the
car,
they
make
an
arrest
for
reckless
driving,
they
searched
the
car
then
pulled
up
the
gun.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
used
that
gun
in
evidence
or
is
that
a
violation
--
have
they
violated
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
think
that
if
they
suspected
that
they
heard
this
an
old
car
they
suspected
this
might
possible
be
the
car
that
would
not
be
cause
for
them
to
arrest
the
people
for
the
previous
crime
but
if
they
stopped
them
and
arrested
them
for
reckless
driving,
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
for
them
to
concern
themselves
as
to
whether
there
might
be
a
gun
around
which
might
be
used
against
them.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
that's
quite
a
different
case
and
when
i
put
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
problem
is
that
seems
to
me
that
supreme
court
of
tennessee
based
its
decision
on
the
proposition
that
the
search
was
made
for
evidence
of
the
crime
for
which
these
people
were
arrested
that's
on
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix
and
that
would
be
the
crime
of
reckless
driving.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
because
on
page
45
the
--
i'm
looking
onto
this
i
am.
the
court
says
that
so
long
as
the
state
tennessee
there
have
been
reasonable
limits.
first,
the
police
may
search
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest
the
person
and
the
property
of
the
person
arrested
for
evidence
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
arrested
and
for
weapons
which
might
be
utilized
for
resistance
in
order
to
escape.
now,
if
that
is
the
--
if
that's
state
correctly
states
the
law
applied
here
and
if
the
correct
states
the
limit
of
tennessee
law
and
i
just
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
search
here
has
to
be
justified
in
terms
of
the
reckless
driving
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
within
those
reasonable
limits
but
the
court
says
that
(a)
it's
got
to
be
reasonable
and
(b)
that
it's
got
to
be
for
evidence
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
arrested
and
for
weapons
which
might
be
utilized
for
assistance
or
escape.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
passed
on
it
in
terms
of
article
vii.
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
forgive
me
for
reverting
to
our
earlier
colloquy?

of

it
is
with
regardless
when
that
is
said
here
the
conviction
was
for
contempt
not
for
the
shooting.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
the
penalty
for
shoot
--
for
this
kind
of
shooting
on
the
tennessee
law
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the

law
of

would
