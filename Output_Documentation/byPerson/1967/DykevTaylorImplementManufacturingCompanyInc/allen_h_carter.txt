mr.
allen
h.
carter
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
position
of
the
taylor
manufacturing
company
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
mr.
loyd
powers
did
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
automobile
which
was
at
the
mcminn
county
jail
immediately
after
the
apprehension
of
these
defendants.
now,
i
might
state
that
in
addition
to
the
evidence
which
mr.
gottesman
sets
forth
and
to
the
statement
of
the
case
that
the
sheriff
of
monroe
county
in
whose
county
the
shooting
took
place
put
a
description
of
the
automobile
out
or
over
his
radio
and
our
sheriff
kirkpatrick
testified
that
the
automobile
which
he
later
saw
in
the
adjoining
county,
mcminn
county
matched
the
description
of
the
automobile
that
he
put
out
over
the
radio.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
this
is
the
only
description
which
our
sheriff
powers
says
that
he
received
at
the
--
or
at
the
time
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
that's
what
sheriff
powers
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
certainly,
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
what
sheriff
kirkpatrick
said
that
he
put
out.
this
is
what
sheriff
powers
said
that
he
received,
yes
sir.
and
the
questions
which
certainly
are
involved
in
the
case
are
the
question
of
the
search
of
the
automobile,
the
question
of
the
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
and
also
the
question
we
say
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
trial
or
the
federal
questions,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
properly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
the
original
appeal.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
as
the
court
had
held
in
rabinowitz
and
other
cases,
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case
determined
what
is
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
relied
primarily
on
the
preston
case
and
then
involved
in
the
vagrancy
charged
where
three
men
were
sitting
in
their
automobile
and
they
were
for
long
period
of
time
and
they
were
arrested
charged
with
--
i
mean,
with
vagrancy.
no
crime
they
had
been
committed
as
such
in
preston.
we
say
that
this
case
and
the
present
case
is
--
are
distinguishable
from
the
preston
case
in
that
in
this
case
a
shooting
had
occurred
and
in
a
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that
the
shooting
episode
had
occurred
in
this
joining
county,
yes
sir.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question
if
i
might
answer
it
in
this
way
at
the
time
they
were
stopped
on
the
highway
for
reckless
driving
there
was
a
conversation
which
took
place
at
that
time
in
involving
the
defendants
and
our
sheriff
powers.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
regarding
to
bullet
hole
which
was
found
in
the
rear
of
this
automobile.
now,
the
bullet
hole
which
was
found
in
the
rear
of
this
automobile
was
there
for
everyone
to
see.
the
--
and
in
response
to
the
question
by
sheriff
powers
as
to
why
are
or
where
did
the
bullet
hole
come
from
while
the
defendants
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case
made
a
comment
that
that
hole
had
been
there
for
a
long
time.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
your
honor,
this
was
the
exactly
when
--
the
conversation
took
place
was
when
that
first
stop
them
on
the
highway
at
this
road
block.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
in
the
brief
yes
your
honor
and
it's
also
in
the
record.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
your
honor,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
you
can
arrest
three
people
for
reckless
driving
but
what
i'm
saying
is
in
this
case
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
mckinney
was
the
only
gentleman
who
was
arrested
for
reckless
driving.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir,
they
were
being
in
held
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
actually,
they
were
being
detained
on
no
charge
immediately
after
this
arrest
for
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
they
were
certainly
just
being
detained
pending
further
investigation
of
the
shooting
episode
which
was
in
adjoining
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
the
person
who
was
charged
with
reckless
driving
once
the
owner
of
the
automobile
whose
car
was
searched.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that
was
necessary
to
arrest
these
men
for
the
shooting
before
the
search.
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
think
that
in
this
case
that
the
automobile
which
was
being
searched
was
being
held
as
evidence
in
this
shooting
which
was
in
this
adjoining
county.
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
that
the
officers
had
the
right
to
the
custody
of
this
car
because
it
was
the
instrumentality
with
which
these
gentlemen
went
to
this
adjoining
county.
it
was
the
way
that
they
fled
from
the
scene.
it
contained
a
bullet
hole
in
the
rear
of
the
automobile
and
it
was
the
way
in
which
they
return.
there's
a
certainly
this
would
give
rise
to
an
officer
who
had
information
concerning
the
shooting
episode
in
this
adjoining
county.
i
think
that
this
would
give
--
i
mean
rise
to
probable
cause
for
him
to
believe
that
these
defendants
were
involved
in
that
shooting
episode.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
we
are
to
say
that
the
harris
case
of
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
in
the
harris
case
and
also
in
the
cooper
case,
i
have
difficulty
in
saying
where
those
statutes
authorizing
these
searches
merely
--
i
mean,
merely
because
the
statutes
provides
it,
they
can
be
impounded
has
anything
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
of
the
search.
this,
to
me
would
seem
to
be
that
state's
statute
in
conflict
with
the
federal
constitution
would
prevail
but
certainly
it's
not
true
and
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
this
makes
any
difference
even
in
the
harris
case
or
the
cooper
case.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
we
are
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
there
is
no
explanation
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
i
can't
at
the
time
this
was
done,
it
was
late
at
night
for
that
matter.
i
can
well
explain
why
that
there
is
no
search
warrant
gotten
because
in
other
cases
there
shows
that
the
magistrates
were
closed
by
so
to
speak
and
things
like
that
in
this
case,
there
is
--
i
mean
there's
nothing
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
he
was
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
very
small,
14,000
people.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir,
he
wouldn't
be
too
far
away
of
it.
i
mean,
the
record
but
it's
a
mile
half
away.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
and
some
12
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
was
midnight
or
rather
around
that
time.
the
shooting
occurred
approximately
11
o'clock.
they
were
stopped
at
approximately
11:30
some
miles
from
the
place
where
the
shooting
took
place
and
immediately
take
him
to
the
jail
and
thereafter
the
car
was
immediately
searched
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
there
had
been
an
exchange.
there
was
only
one
shot
that
hit
the
automobile
as
it
as
leaving
there
and
the
sheriff
in
monroe
county,
the
adjoining
county
where
the
shooting
took
place
was
aware
of
the
shooting
episode
and
he
put
it
out
over
the
radio
that
shooting
episode
had
taken
place.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
the
record
shows
by
sheriff
kirkpatrick
what
was
put
out
of
the
broadcast
--
i
mean
concerning
the
shooting
episode
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
there's
nothing
in
there
to
show
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
sheriff
powers
knew
that
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
gun
fire
but
to
point
that
question
out,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
any
officer
would
be
correct
in
assuming
that
where
there
was
a
shooting
episode
that
there
was
an
exchange
of
gun
fire
and
as
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
certainly
think
it
does.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
the
frank
that
these
people
when
stopped
said
that
it
was
an
old
bullet
hole
which
was
obviously
contrary
to
the
side
of
it
as
testified
not
only
by
sheriff
powers
but
sheriff
canon
to
the
effect
that
it
was
fresh
because
it
had
absolutely
no
rust
around
it.
i
think
that
this
was
in
conflict
with
normal
senses
and
so
forth
to
this
extent.
all
of
this
evidence
in
this
record
stands
uncontradicted
concerning
the
fact
that
as
to
the
opinion
that
sheriff
canon
had,
he
said
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
shot
have
been
made
that
very
night.
all
these
stands
uncontradicted
and
i
think
that
the
fact
the
bullet
hole
was
in
the
rear
of
the
automobile
certainly
gave
rise
to
this
matter
of
probable
cause.
not
only
was
he
stopped
for
reckless
driving
but
he
was
stopped
because
the
officer
had
reason
to
believe
that
this
serious
offense
shooting
in
this
home
in
this
adjoining
county
had
been
committed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
committed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
the
opinion
further
went
on
to
say
that
under
all
the
fashion
and
circumstances
in
the
case
that
it
had
met
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
search
was
reasonable.
i
think
the
opinion
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
further
i
mean,
this
went
on
that
the
search
conducted
with
then,
the
reasonable
limits
and
i
can't
speak
for
a
court
to
certain
what
they
say
and
i
can't
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
your
honor,
when
they
point
out
this
also
that
immediately
after
the
sheriff
of
the
adjoining
county
arrived
in
which
the
shooting
took
place,
these
men
were
taken
back
to
monroe
county
where
the
shooting
occurred
and
at
that
time
they
were
charge
for
shooting
in
to
this
house
and
certainly
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir,
that
was
nolle
on
prosequi.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
required
a
jury
trial
in
the
contempt
proceeding
has
been
argued
time
and
again
and
certainly
one
of
the
points
to
be
raised
in
this
case
was
whether
or
not
the
question
on
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
properly
brought
to
your
attention
on
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
indicate
that
certainly
that
this
issue
is
preposterous
because
throughout
the
proceedings
that
they
were
relying
on
a
jury
trial
but
nowhere
in
the
assignments
of
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
was
a
question
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
ever
raised,
the
only
constitutional
amendment,
i'll
say
this,
it
was
in
the
propositions
of
law
in
the
brief
which
they
presented
they
included
it
in
the
propositions
of
law.
but
in
the
brief
which
followed
it
was
not
mentioned.
the
only
place
which
it
was
mentioned
are
these
amendments
were
mentioned
where
in
the
propositions
of
law.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir,
that
was
the
--
i
mean,
this
was
in
the
assignment
of
error
which
was
right,
i
mean
raised
by
the
petitioners.
they
said
that
they
were
relying
on
the
seventh
amendment
and
this
was
specifically
raised
in
the
assignment
of
error
but
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
not
raised
in
the
assignment
of
error.
the
only
place
was
in
the
proposition
of
law.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
not.
i
can't
answer
that.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
prosecuted
for
reckless
driving
or
not.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i'll
answer
this
way,
if
it
please
the
court.
he
was
in
--
i
mean
these
three
gentlemen
were
indicted
in
monroe
county
for
this
crime
and
they
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no.
where
the
shooting
took
place
was
where
they
were
indicted.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
and
immediately
after
the
indictment
was
presented
and
so
forth
they
then
paid
because
and
the
fine
--
i
mean,
in
the
charge
was
reduced
and
under
tennessee
law
when
you
nolle
on
the
payment
of
the
cost
you
cannot
thereafter
have
another
indictment
return
it
against
you
and
over
if
you
did
if
we
double
jeopardy.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
wasn't
reduced
as
such
which
is
dismissed
on
the
payment
of
the
cost.
it
was
dismissed,
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
mean
there
i
can't
speak
for
the
attorney
general
even
there
because
i
wouldn't
do
him
nothing
that
i
was
at
the
trial
at
that
time
but
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
anytime
when
people
have
weapon
so
called
in
their
control
i
mean
that's
certainly
that
they
have
a
right
to
search
for
it
and
ask
what
the
court
held.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
true.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
they
--
as
such
substantially
that
is
correct
but
i
might
say
that
they
were
not
in
a
cell
as
such,
they
were
sitting
on
the
bench
as
you
walk
through
the
front
door
of
the
jail
but
they
were
not
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
as
to
the
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could've
walked
out,
i
can
only
assume
that
two
of
them
could've
walked
out.
they
weren't
being
prevented
from
walking
out
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
say
substantially
that
they
were
under
restraint
to
the
effect
pending
further
in
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
would
get
back
to
the
questions
to
whether
or
not
the
car
be
held
as
evidence
in
the
--
if
in
fact
the
car
could
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
--
the
record
doesn't
say
while
he
searched
the
car
but
i
would
only
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
don't
think
so.
no
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i'm
saying
this
that
the
car
was
in
a
public
place
and
that
under
this
--
under
the
circumstances
any
one
of
these
men's
confederates
are
associates
could've
gone
to
the
car
and
remove
evidence
which
was
contained
in
the
car
concerning
the
shooting
which
occurred
in
monroe
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
pardon
me?
mr.
allen
h.
carter
then
it
would
be
--
i
mean
it
would
go
back
as
to
a
question
of
control
if
the
car
was
in
fact
being
held
as
evidence
then
i
think
that
the
officers
had
the
right
to
search
the
car
if
in
fact
it
was
still
under
the
control
of
the
defendant
mckinney
then
i
think
that
any
of
his
associates
are
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
as
far
as
the
keys
--
i
don't
know
who
had
the
keys
to
the
car.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
defendants
didn't
have
keys
at
that
time
after
they
arrived.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
going
further
in
the
--
if
i
might,
the
matter
goes
as
to
whether
or
not
these
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
state
court.
for
--
i
mean,
for
the
prosecution
as
such
for
contempt
criminal
contempt
it's
--
has
long
been
the
rule
in
that
state
and
for
many,
many
years
is
of
course
well
knows
was
a
law
down
to
which
you
might
call
the
barnett
case
that
under
the
criminal
law
that
all
courts
have
the
right
to
--
i
mean,
punish
some
merely
for
violation
of
the
court
order
or
an
order
of
its
court.
now,
in
the
sheriff
case,
the
federal
case
why
it
provided
of
course
that
the
six
months
was
--
i
mean
was
the
ruling
was
of
test.
in
the
case
at
bar
the
maximum
penalty
under
tennessee
law
was
10
days
in
jail
and
a
$50.00
fine.
i
mean,
throughout
the
arguments
presented
by
the
petitioners
they
indicate
that
because
what
they
did
in
the
state
of
tennessee
was
a
felony
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
but
in
effect
what
they
were
been
tried
for
was
the
violation
of
the
court
order.
now,
there
are
some
comment
concerning
the
reason
for
the
court
order
and
so
forth,
i
might
point
out
that
the
injunction
order
which
was
handed
down,
which
was
issued
in
the
case
was
an
agreed
order.
it
was
agreed
on
by
the
attorney's
for
the
petitioners
concerning
the
enjoinment
of
violence
and
so
forth
and
this
is
a
common
practice
in
all
states
i
think
which
have
so-called
right
to
work
law
so
where
the
people
who
do
not
choose
to
strike
continue
to
go
to
work
then
they're
protected
under
the
law
from
any
harm
that
might
come
to
them
by
people
who
are
on
the
picket
lines
or
elsewhere
for
that
matter.
now,
in
this
case
it
--
i
mean
it
goes
back
to
a
question
as
whether
or
not
the
sixth
amendment
applies
to
the
states
even
in
the
jury
trial
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
certainly
it's
our
position
that
had
this
case
a
reason
in
the
federal
court
system
with
the
maximum
penalty
of
10
days
in
jail
as
provide
by
law
and
a
$50.00
fine
that
in
a
federal
system
that
this
punishment
would
be
--
i
might
say,
this
punishment
would
be
proper
under
the
sheriff's
case.
and
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
proper
in
the
state
of
tennessee
where
there
is
in
some
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
apply
to
the
jury
trial
question
in
state
court.
it's
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
comprehend
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
state
court
concerning
jury
questions
are
--
i
mean
is
--
that
is
excuse
me,
questionable.
now,
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
would
say
that
under
the
sheriff
case
where
the
--
it
was
permitted
the
six
month
since
it
was
permitted
they
tried
summarily
without
a
jury.
i
would
say
that
that
certain
apply
in
this
case
where
the
maximum
sentence
is
only
10
days
and
a
$50.00
fine
and
i
think
that
even
if
the
court
did
hold
that
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
were
applicable
to
the
states
that
under
sheriff
--
i
mean
you
would
have
the
same
result
here
they
were
not
tried
for
jury
trial.
now,
the
cases
goes
back
as
concerning
whether
or
not
this
car
can
be
held
as
evidence
and
to
whether
or
not
the
search
under
that
question
was
--
i
mean,
was
justified
and
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
this
search
was
reasonable
and
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendants
were
not
or
the
petitioners
were
not
violated
by
the
search
nor
were
they
violated
by
the
fact
that
they
were
not
presented
with
the
jury
trial.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
was
not
presented
to
the
court
in
the
contempt
case.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i'll
put
it
this
way,
it
was
not
ever
seen
--
i
mean,
the
weapon
was
never
seen
by
the
chancellor
of
the
--
i
mean
the
bullets
were
never
seen
by
the
chancellor.
he
made
a
comment
that
--
i
mean,
to
treat
as
file
in
withdrawn
but
i
mean
in
actuality
it
was
never
there,
he
never
saw
it.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
like
i
say
he
said
that
to
treat
as
filed
and
withdrawn
but
it
was
never
seen
by
the
chancellor.
in
fact,
it
was
still
in
monroe
county
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
--
the
adjoining
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
this
is
--
we
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
chapman
case
concerning
the
harmless
error
as
i
understand
things
of
this
nature
that
you
have
to
show
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
can't
answer
as
to
the
fact
that
it
did
without
being
--
i
mean,
without
speaking
for
the
chancellor.
he
made
a
comment
that
he
had
waived
the
evidence,
all
the
evidence
which
he
had
heard
in
its
severe
form
and
that
he
found
that
they
guilty
the
unreasonable
doubt.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
that
was
passed
on.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
you
mean
--
i
mean
concerning
the
weapon?
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
they
overrule
as
such
concerning
that
testimony
concerning
this,
the
finding
of
this
gun.
that's
right.
they
--
i
mean
the
testimony
was
there
that
these
officers
had
seen
it
that
the
ammunition
which
they
found
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
was
comparative,
i
mean
was
the
same
type
of
ammunition
which
was
found
at
the
home
into
whose
house
the
bullet
was
fired.
in
other
words,
the
same
projectile
and
it
was
a
different
type
projectile.
in
other
words,
it
was
similar
to
attorney
to
a
lawful
projectile
and
that
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
but
the
one
that
was
found
at
the
home
of
where
the
shooting
took
place
and
the
ones
which
were
found
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
were
the
same.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
for
that
question
that
it
was
relevant,
yes
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
position
of
the
taylor
manufacturing
company
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
mr.
loyd
powers
did
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
automobile
which
was
at
the
mcminn
county
jail
immediately
after
the
apprehension
of
these
defendants.
now,
i
might
state
that
in
addition
to
the
evidence
which
mr.
gottesman
sets
forth
and
to
the
statement
of
the
case
that
the
sheriff
of
monroe
county
in
whose
county
the
shooting
took
place
put
a
description
of
the
automobile
out
or
over
his
radio
and
our
sheriff
kirkpatrick
testified
that
the
automobile
which
he
later
saw
in
the
adjoining
county,
mcminn
county
matched
the
description
of
the
automobile
that
he
put
out
over
the
radio.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
this
is
the
only
description
which
our
sheriff
powers
says
that
he
received
at
the
--
or
at
the
time
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
that's
what
sheriff
powers
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
certainly,
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
what
sheriff
kirkpatrick
said
that
he
put
out.
this
is
what
sheriff
powers
said
that
he
received,
yes
sir.
and
the
questions
which
certainly
are
involved
in
the
case
are
the
question
of
the
search
of
the
automobile,
the
question
of
the
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
and
also
the
question
we
say
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
trial
or
the
federal
questions,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
properly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
the
original
appeal.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
as
the
court
had
held
in
rabinowitz
and
other
cases,
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case
determined
what
is
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
relied
primarily
on
the
preston
case
and
then
involved
in
the
vagrancy
charged
where
three
men
were
sitting
in
their
automobile
and
they
were
for
long
period
of
time
and
they
were
arrested
charged
with
--
i
mean,
with
vagrancy.
no
crime
they
had
been
committed
as
such
in
preston.
we
say
that
this
case
and
the
present
case
is
--
are
distinguishable
from
the
preston
case
in
that
in
this
case
a
shooting
had
occurred
and
in
a
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that
the
shooting
episode
had
occurred
in
this
joining
county,
yes
sir.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question
if
i
might
answer
it
in
this
way
at
the
time
they
were
stopped
on
the
highway
for
reckless
driving
there
was
a
conversation
which
took
place
at
that
time
in
involving
the
defendants
and
our
sheriff
powers.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
regarding
to
bullet
hole
which
was
found
in
the
rear
of
this
automobile.
now,
the
bullet
hole
which
was
found
in
the
rear
of
this
automobile
was
there
for
everyone
to
see.
the
--
and
in
response
to
the
question
by
sheriff
powers
as
to
why
are
or
where
did
the
bullet
hole
come
from
while
the
defendants
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case
made
a
comment
that
that
hole
had
been
there
for
a
long
time.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
your
honor,
this
was
the
exactly
when
--
the
conversation
took
place
was
when
that
first
stop
them
on
the
highway
at
this
road
block.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
in
the
brief
yes
your
honor
and
it's
also
in
the
record.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
your
honor,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
you
can
arrest
three
people
for
reckless
driving
but
what
i'm
saying
is
in
this
case
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
mckinney
was
the
only
gentleman
who
was
arrested
for
reckless
driving.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir,
they
were
being
in
held
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
actually,
they
were
being
detained
on
no
charge
immediately
after
this
arrest
for
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
they
were
certainly
just
being
detained
pending
further
investigation
of
the
shooting
episode
which
was
in
adjoining
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
the
person
who
was
charged
with
reckless
driving
once
the
owner
of
the
automobile
whose
car
was
searched.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that
was
necessary
to
arrest
these
men
for
the
shooting
before
the
search.
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
think
that
in
this
case
that
the
automobile
which
was
being
searched
was
being
held
as
evidence
in
this
shooting
which
was
in
this
adjoining
county.
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
that
the
officers
had
the
right
to
the
custody
of
this
car
because
it
was
the
instrumentality
with
which
these
gentlemen
went
to
this
adjoining
county.
it
was
the
way
that
they
fled
from
the
scene.
it
contained
a
bullet
hole
in
the
rear
of
the
automobile
and
it
was
the
way
in
which
they
return.
there's
a
certainly
this
would
give
rise
to
an
officer
who
had
information
concerning
the
shooting
episode
in
this
adjoining
county.
i
think
that
this
would
give
--
i
mean
rise
to
probable
cause
for
him
to
believe
that
these
defendants
were
involved
in
that
shooting
episode.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
we
are
to
say
that
the
harris
case
of
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
in
the
harris
case
and
also
in
the
cooper
case,
i
have
difficulty
in
saying
where
those
statutes
authorizing
these
searches
merely
--
i
mean,
merely
because
the
statutes
provides
it,
they
can
be
impounded
has
anything
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
of
the
search.
this,
to
me
would
seem
to
be
that
state's
statute
in
conflict
with
the
federal
constitution
would
prevail
but
certainly
it's
not
true
and
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
this
makes
any
difference
even
in
the
harris
case
or
the
cooper
case.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
we
are
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
there
is
no
explanation
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
i
can't
at
the
time
this
was
done,
it
was
late
at
night
for
that
matter.
i
can
well
explain
why
that
there
is
no
search
warrant
gotten
because
in
other
cases
there
shows
that
the
magistrates
were
closed
by
so
to
speak
and
things
like
that
in
this
case,
there
is
--
i
mean
there's
nothing
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
he
was
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
very
small,
14,000
people.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir,
he
wouldn't
be
too
far
away
of
it.
i
mean,
the
record
but
it's
a
mile
half
away.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
and
some
12
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
was
midnight
or
rather
around
that
time.
the
shooting
occurred
approximately
11
o'clock.
they
were
stopped
at
approximately
11:30
some
miles
from
the
place
where
the
shooting
took
place
and
immediately
take
him
to
the
jail
and
thereafter
the
car
was
immediately
searched
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no
sir.
there
had
been
an
exchange.
there
was
only
one
shot
that
hit
the
automobile
as
it
as
leaving
there
and
the
sheriff
in
monroe
county,
the
adjoining
county
where
the
shooting
took
place
was
aware
of
the
shooting
episode
and
he
put
it
out
over
the
radio
that
shooting
episode
had
taken
place.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
the
record
shows
by
sheriff
kirkpatrick
what
was
put
out
of
the
broadcast
--
i
mean
concerning
the
shooting
episode
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
there's
nothing
in
there
to
show
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
sheriff
powers
knew
that
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
gun
fire
but
to
point
that
question
out,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
any
officer
would
be
correct
in
assuming
that
where
there
was
a
shooting
episode
that
there
was
an
exchange
of
gun
fire
and
as
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
certainly
think
it
does.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
the
frank
that
these
people
when
stopped
said
that
it
was
an
old
bullet
hole
which
was
obviously
contrary
to
the
side
of
it
as
testified
not
only
by
sheriff
powers
but
sheriff
canon
to
the
effect
that
it
was
fresh
because
it
had
absolutely
no
rust
around
it.
i
think
that
this
was
in
conflict
with
normal
senses
and
so
forth
to
this
extent.
all
of
this
evidence
in
this
record
stands
uncontradicted
concerning
the
fact
that
as
to
the
opinion
that
sheriff
canon
had,
he
said
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
shot
have
been
made
that
very
night.
all
these
stands
uncontradicted
and
i
think
that
the
fact
the
bullet
hole
was
in
the
rear
of
the
automobile
certainly
gave
rise
to
this
matter
of
probable
cause.
not
only
was
he
stopped
for
reckless
driving
but
he
was
stopped
because
the
officer
had
reason
to
believe
that
this
serious
offense
shooting
in
this
home
in
this
adjoining
county
had
been
committed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
committed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
the
opinion
further
went
on
to
say
that
under
all
the
fashion
and
circumstances
in
the
case
that
it
had
met
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
search
was
reasonable.
i
think
the
opinion
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it's
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
further
i
mean,
this
went
on
that
the
search
conducted
with
then,
the
reasonable
limits
and
i
can't
speak
for
a
court
to
certain
what
they
say
and
i
can't
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
your
honor,
when
they
point
out
this
also
that
immediately
after
the
sheriff
of
the
adjoining
county
arrived
in
which
the
shooting
took
place,
these
men
were
taken
back
to
monroe
county
where
the
shooting
occurred
and
at
that
time
they
were
charge
for
shooting
in
to
this
house
and
certainly
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir,
that
was
nolle
on
prosequi.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
required
a
jury
trial
in
the
contempt
proceeding
has
been
argued
time
and
again
and
certainly
one
of
the
points
to
be
raised
in
this
case
was
whether
or
not
the
question
on
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
properly
brought
to
your
attention
on
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
indicate
that
certainly
that
this
issue
is
preposterous
because
throughout
the
proceedings
that
they
were
relying
on
a
jury
trial
but
nowhere
in
the
assignments
of
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
was
a
question
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
ever
raised,
the
only
constitutional
amendment,
i'll
say
this,
it
was
in
the
propositions
of
law
in
the
brief
which
they
presented
they
included
it
in
the
propositions
of
law.
but
in
the
brief
which
followed
it
was
not
mentioned.
the
only
place
which
it
was
mentioned
are
these
amendments
were
mentioned
where
in
the
propositions
of
law.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir,
that
was
the
--
i
mean,
this
was
in
the
assignment
of
error
which
was
right,
i
mean
raised
by
the
petitioners.
they
said
that
they
were
relying
on
the
seventh
amendment
and
this
was
specifically
raised
in
the
assignment
of
error
but
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
not
raised
in
the
assignment
of
error.
the
only
place
was
in
the
proposition
of
law.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
not.
i
can't
answer
that.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
prosecuted
for
reckless
driving
or
not.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i'll
answer
this
way,
if
it
please
the
court.
he
was
in
--
i
mean
these
three
gentlemen
were
indicted
in
monroe
county
for
this
crime
and
they
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
no.
where
the
shooting
took
place
was
where
they
were
indicted.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
and
immediately
after
the
indictment
was
presented
and
so
forth
they
then
paid
because
and
the
fine
--
i
mean,
in
the
charge
was
reduced
and
under
tennessee
law
when
you
nolle
on
the
payment
of
the
cost
you
cannot
thereafter
have
another
indictment
return
it
against
you
and
over
if
you
did
if
we
double
jeopardy.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
wasn't
reduced
as
such
which
is
dismissed
on
the
payment
of
the
cost.
it
was
dismissed,
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
mean
there
i
can't
speak
for
the
attorney
general
even
there
because
i
wouldn't
do
him
nothing
that
i
was
at
the
trial
at
that
time
but
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
anytime
when
people
have
weapon
so
called
in
their
control
i
mean
that's
certainly
that
they
have
a
right
to
search
for
it
and
ask
what
the
court
held.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
true.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor,
they
--
as
such
substantially
that
is
correct
but
i
might
say
that
they
were
not
in
a
cell
as
such,
they
were
sitting
on
the
bench
as
you
walk
through
the
front
door
of
the
jail
but
they
were
not
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
as
to
the
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could've
walked
out,
i
can
only
assume
that
two
of
them
could've
walked
out.
they
weren't
being
prevented
from
walking
out
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
say
substantially
that
they
were
under
restraint
to
the
effect
pending
further
in
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
would
get
back
to
the
questions
to
whether
or
not
the
car
be
held
as
evidence
in
the
--
if
in
fact
the
car
could
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
--
the
record
doesn't
say
while
he
searched
the
car
but
i
would
only
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
don't
think
so.
no
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i'm
saying
this
that
the
car
was
in
a
public
place
and
that
under
this
--
under
the
circumstances
any
one
of
these
men's
confederates
are
associates
could've
gone
to
the
car
and
remove
evidence
which
was
contained
in
the
car
concerning
the
shooting
which
occurred
in
monroe
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
pardon
me?
mr.
allen
h.
carter
then
it
would
be
--
i
mean
it
would
go
back
as
to
a
question
of
control
if
the
car
was
in
fact
being
held
as
evidence
then
i
think
that
the
officers
had
the
right
to
search
the
car
if
in
fact
it
was
still
under
the
control
of
the
defendant
mckinney
then
i
think
that
any
of
his
associates
are
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
as
far
as
the
keys
--
i
don't
know
who
had
the
keys
to
the
car.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
that's
right.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
defendants
didn't
have
keys
at
that
time
after
they
arrived.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
going
further
in
the
--
if
i
might,
the
matter
goes
as
to
whether
or
not
these
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
state
court.
for
--
i
mean,
for
the
prosecution
as
such
for
contempt
criminal
contempt
it's
--
has
long
been
the
rule
in
that
state
and
for
many,
many
years
is
of
course
well
knows
was
a
law
down
to
which
you
might
call
the
barnett
case
that
under
the
criminal
law
that
all
courts
have
the
right
to
--
i
mean,
punish
some
merely
for
violation
of
the
court
order
or
an
order
of
its
court.
now,
in
the
sheriff
case,
the
federal
case
why
it
provided
of
course
that
the
six
months
was
--
i
mean
was
the
ruling
was
of
test.
in
the
case
at
bar
the
maximum
penalty
under
tennessee
law
was
10
days
in
jail
and
a
$50.00
fine.
i
mean,
throughout
the
arguments
presented
by
the
petitioners
they
indicate
that
because
what
they
did
in
the
state
of
tennessee
was
a
felony
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
but
in
effect
what
they
were
been
tried
for
was
the
violation
of
the
court
order.
now,
there
are
some
comment
concerning
the
reason
for
the
court
order
and
so
forth,
i
might
point
out
that
the
injunction
order
which
was
handed
down,
which
was
issued
in
the
case
was
an
agreed
order.
it
was
agreed
on
by
the
attorney's
for
the
petitioners
concerning
the
enjoinment
of
violence
and
so
forth
and
this
is
a
common
practice
in
all
states
i
think
which
have
so-called
right
to
work
law
so
where
the
people
who
do
not
choose
to
strike
continue
to
go
to
work
then
they're
protected
under
the
law
from
any
harm
that
might
come
to
them
by
people
who
are
on
the
picket
lines
or
elsewhere
for
that
matter.
now,
in
this
case
it
--
i
mean
it
goes
back
to
a
question
as
whether
or
not
the
sixth
amendment
applies
to
the
states
even
in
the
jury
trial
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
certainly
it's
our
position
that
had
this
case
a
reason
in
the
federal
court
system
with
the
maximum
penalty
of
10
days
in
jail
as
provide
by
law
and
a
$50.00
fine
that
in
a
federal
system
that
this
punishment
would
be
--
i
might
say,
this
punishment
would
be
proper
under
the
sheriff's
case.
and
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
proper
in
the
state
of
tennessee
where
there
is
in
some
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
apply
to
the
jury
trial
question
in
state
court.
it's
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
comprehend
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
state
court
concerning
jury
questions
are
--
i
mean
is
--
that
is
excuse
me,
questionable.
now,
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
i
would
say
that
under
the
sheriff
case
where
the
--
it
was
permitted
the
six
month
since
it
was
permitted
they
tried
summarily
without
a
jury.
i
would
say
that
that
certain
apply
in
this
case
where
the
maximum
sentence
is
only
10
days
and
a
$50.00
fine
and
i
think
that
even
if
the
court
did
hold
that
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
were
applicable
to
the
states
that
under
sheriff
--
i
mean
you
would
have
the
same
result
here
they
were
not
tried
for
jury
trial.
now,
the
cases
goes
back
as
concerning
whether
or
not
this
car
can
be
held
as
evidence
and
to
whether
or
not
the
search
under
that
question
was
--
i
mean,
was
justified
and
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
this
search
was
reasonable
and
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendants
were
not
or
the
petitioners
were
not
violated
by
the
search
nor
were
they
violated
by
the
fact
that
they
were
not
presented
with
the
jury
trial.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
it
was
not
presented
to
the
court
in
the
contempt
case.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i'll
put
it
this
way,
it
was
not
ever
seen
--
i
mean,
the
weapon
was
never
seen
by
the
chancellor
of
the
--
i
mean
the
bullets
were
never
seen
by
the
chancellor.
he
made
a
comment
that
--
i
mean,
to
treat
as
file
in
withdrawn
but
i
mean
in
actuality
it
was
never
there,
he
never
saw
it.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
like
i
say
he
said
that
to
treat
as
filed
and
withdrawn
but
it
was
never
seen
by
the
chancellor.
in
fact,
it
was
still
in
monroe
county
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
--
the
adjoining
county.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
your
honor
this
is
--
we
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
chapman
case
concerning
the
harmless
error
as
i
understand
things
of
this
nature
that
you
have
to
show
that
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
well,
--
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
can't
answer
as
to
the
fact
that
it
did
without
being
--
i
mean,
without
speaking
for
the
chancellor.
he
made
a
comment
that
he
had
waived
the
evidence,
all
the
evidence
which
he
had
heard
in
its
severe
form
and
that
he
found
that
they
guilty
the
unreasonable
doubt.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
that
was
passed
on.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
you
mean
--
i
mean
concerning
the
weapon?
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
yes
sir.
they
overrule
as
such
concerning
that
testimony
concerning
this,
the
finding
of
this
gun.
that's
right.
they
--
i
mean
the
testimony
was
there
that
these
officers
had
seen
it
that
the
ammunition
which
they
found
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
was
comparative,
i
mean
was
the
same
type
of
ammunition
which
was
found
at
the
home
into
whose
house
the
bullet
was
fired.
in
other
words,
the
same
projectile
and
it
was
a
different
type
projectile.
in
other
words,
it
was
similar
to
attorney
to
a
lawful
projectile
and
that
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
but
the
one
that
was
found
at
the
home
of
where
the
shooting
took
place
and
the
ones
which
were
found
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
were
the
same.
mr.
allen
h.
carter
i
think
for
that
question
that
it
was
relevant,
yes
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you.
