what
the
petitioners
say
about
his
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
said
he's
going
to
leave
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

clear
that
he
didn't
say
it
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whatever
he
said,
he
said
he
was
going
to
leave
his
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
he
saw
the
hole
in
front
this
car
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
a
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
rifle?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
pretty
hard
to
see
what
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
a
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
absolute
level
of
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
a
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
argument
here
if
congress
constituted
attempt
here
with
a
misdemeanor
under
tennessee
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
there
are
misdemeanors
under
tennessee
law.
in
any
event
whether
it's
indictable
or
it's
considered
in
any
offense,
the
actual
powers
you
should
engage
in
a
man
who's
a
criminal
but
that's
a
minor.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
one
would
be
clear
whether
they
have
a
jury
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

the
jury
trial
with
respect
to
intent
that
your
right
to
jury
trial
will
indict
you
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
wouldn't
--
did
you
suggest
that
in
an
indictment
for
shooting
this
rifle
--
this
house
that
the
previous
adjudication
would
be
anyway
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
not
to
taint
for
a
moment
the
procedures
of
that
criminal
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
committing
a
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
just
admit
you
got
a
jury
trial
and
get
a
sentence
in
five
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
invite
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
that,
he
probably
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
is
the
statute
permitted
the
penalty
two
years
--
three
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
deny
that
the
tennessee
law
was
improper?
that
each
of
the
appellant's
car
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reckless
driving
of
car
as
i
gather
is
the
criminal
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
bailable.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
not
the
point.
that's
the
point
if
you
challenge
a
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

we
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
issue
up
here,
the
probable
cause
--
justice
byron

white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.

it
was

it
started
in

the
shooting
took
place
in
february
of

the
contempt
trial
was
march
of
1966.
justice
byron

yes,
but
the
only
description
was
that
this
was
an
old
model
car.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
mr.
carter.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gottesman
seems
to
indicate
that
that
the
issue
of
probable
cause
to
search
this
car
in
connection
with
the
shooting
is
not
an
issue
here
that
apparently
maybe
he
didn't
mean
to
say
this
but
apparently
we
are
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
next
to
the
shooting

if
that
so,
would
you
argue
that
the

therefore,
necessarily
probable
cause
to
arrest
this
man.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
claim
that
this
--
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
validity
of
this
search
necessarily
address
on
at
least
thought
they're
being
probable
cause
to
make
that
actual
shooting?
justice
byron

white
and
without
probable
cause,
you
can
make
the
search
in
connection
to
shooting
that
search
was
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
resting
on
the
any
sort
of
approach
that
the
state
can
in
harris,
just
before
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

have
the
right
to
custody
of
this

impound
it

and
whether
it

may
it
be
