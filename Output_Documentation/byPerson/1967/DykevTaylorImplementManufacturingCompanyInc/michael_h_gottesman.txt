mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tennessee's
supreme
court
and
it
presents
two
issues.
each
of
which
has
been
discussed
at
some
length
already
this
week:
first,
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
at
least
certain
criminal
contempt
cases
and
second,
the
validity
of
the
search
without
warrant
of
an
automobile.
the
issues
arise
in
this
case
however
in
quite
a
different
context
and
since
that
context
may
shape
the
resolution,
i'd
like
to
describe
it
at
least
at
some
length.
we
begin
here
with
the
strike
being
under
taken
by
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company
against
the
company.
petitioners
were
striking
employees
of
the
company.
at
some
point
during
the
strike,
the
company
went
into
the
tennessee
court
of
equity.
they
are
still
separate
courts
in
tennessee
and
it
got
an
injunction
against
certain
conduct
by
the
striking
employees.
the
provisions
of
that
injunction
relevant
here
enjoined
conduct
which
quite
clearly
was
conduct
already
proscribed
by
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
of
tennessee
specifically
it
enjoined
the
striking
employees
from
injuring
or
harming
those
employees
of
the
company
who
came
to
work
or
visitors
or
other
people
who
may
come
to
the
company
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
now,
of
course
it's
undisputed
and
the
company
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
this
conduct
which
was
enjoined
and
indeed
for
which
the
petitioners
ultimately
were
tried
in
contempt
is
a
felony
under
the
state
law
of
tennessee.
sometime
after
the
injunction
was
issued
and
while
the
strike
was
continuing,
a
shot
was
fired
into
the
home
of
one
of
the
employees
who
was
working
during
the
strike.
this
home
was
some
25
miles
from
the
plant
in
the
next
county.
the
shot
was
fired
from
an
automobile
as
the
automobile
raced
away
the
occupants
of
the
house
returned
fire
and
manage
to
hit
the
car
with
one
bode
in
the
back.
deputy
sheriff
powers
who
is
a
sheriff
in
the
county
where
the
plant
is
located
and
who
was
at
the
time
the
record
doesn't
quite
clear
about
15
or
20
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
shooting,
received
the
report
over
his
radio
that
a
shooting
had
occurred
that
car
was
apparently
headed
in
the
direction
of
his
county
and
that
it
was
an
old
make
model
car.
he
expressly
testified
that
that
is
all
that
he
received
over
his
radio
in
terms
of
a
description
of
the
car
and
when
asked,
did
you
get
a
specific
description?
he
said,
no,
that's
all
i
got.
it
was
an
old
make
model
car.
as
he
was
driving
along,
he
saw
an
old
make
model
car
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
that
quite
equipped
and
he
turned
around
and
followed
it.
he
testified
that
was
going
some
78-80
miles
an
hour,
he
couldn't
catch
up
to
it
and
so
he
radio
the
head
to
the
police
in
the
next
town
which
happens
to
be
the
town
the
plant
is
located
in,
to
stop
the
car.
they
did
so
sheriff
powers
is
then
as
they
were
stopped,
caught
up,
pulled
up
along
side.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry.
did
who
saw?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
all
the
record
shows
sheriff
powers
says
he
radio
the
head
and
said
i'm
chasing
an
old
car
and
i
can't
catch
it
please
stop
it.
that's
all
he
recites
having
said.
he
did
testify
that
he
didn't
know
at
this
time
any
more
about
the
car
except
that
it
was
an
old
car.
to
that,
i
assume
is
all
that
he
could've
radio
the
head.
at
any
rate,
the
car
was
stopped
and
the
car
which
was
stopped
we
know
is
petitioner's
car.
sheriff
powers
pulled
up
alongside.
petitioners
were
still
sitting
in
the
car.
he
came
over,
there
was
apparently
a
brief
conversation
not
recorded.
at
the
end
of
which,
sheriff
powers
told
the
occupants
of
the
car
petitioners,
i'm
going
to
take
you
down
to
the
jail.
he
did
not
tell
them
what
the
ground
for
taking
them
was
he
just
said,
i'm
going
to
take
you
down
to
the
jail.
the
petitioners
came
out
of
their
car
and
apparently
we're
taken
in
sheriff
powers'
car
to
the
jail.
no
search
was
conducted
of
the
car
at
this
point
on
the
highway,
but
the
car
was
separately
brought
to
the
jail
and
was
parked
right
outside
the
front
door
of
the
jail.
sheriff
powers
then
testifies,
i
took
the
defendants
petitioners
inside
the
jail
and
sat
them
down
there.
i
told
petitioner
mckinney
who
was
the
driver
of
the
car
that
he
was
under
arrest
for
reckless
driving
and
i
then
went
outside
and
i
searched
the
car.
now,
there
is
no
contention
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
this
at
the
outset.
there's
no
suggestion,
this
was
an
administrative
search.
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
were
any
regulations
in
mcminn
county
tennessee
for
searching
every
car
that
was
impounded.
indeed,
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
this
car
was
impounded.
all
we
know
is
that
the
car
was
brought
to
the
jail
as
in
preston
that
was
the
case
and
as
the
court
suggested
in
preston
for
all
we
know
it
may
have
been
for
the
convenience
of
the
petitioners.
following
the
search
of
course
uncovered
a
gun
and
so
an
ammunition.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
at
that
point,
he
said
nothing
about
his
car.
he
later
said
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
record
isn't
clear
when
he
said
that
because
it
was
a
different
witness
who
testified
i
got
there
and
i
heard
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
isn't
clear
whether
he
said,
--
well,
he
said
it
before
the
search
was
conducted
or
after
the
search
was
conducted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
he
said
that.
the
witness
testified
that
the
petitioner
mckinney
seem
very
scared
and
he
said
i'll
leave
my
car
here
tonight.
i'll
leave
my
car.
and
that
was
the
testimony,
but
it's
not
clear
on
the
record
whether
that
was
said
before
or
after
sheriff
powers
went
out
and
searched
the
car.
in
any
rate,
sheriff
powers
did
testify
that
all
three
petitioners
were
under
restraint
inside
the
jail.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
gun
was
found
as
i
understand
it
under
the
front
right
seat.
i
gather
it
was
not
on
the
seat
but
underneath.
it
isn't
clear
whether
it
was
wedged
underneath
the
seat
or
simply
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
car
in
the
front
right
side.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
whether
it
could
or
not.
there
is
no
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
say,
i
don't
think
the
record
makes
that
clear,
all
sheriff
powers
says
is,
i
went
out
to
search
the
car.
he
was
purely
--
this
was
a
--
an
indiscriminate
or
at
least
the
complete
search
of
a
car
that
he
was
under
taking.
and
he
said
he
found
the
gun
under
the
front
right
seat.
i
think
those
were
the
words
and
as
i
say
it's
not
clear
whether
that
meant
physically
under
it
or
down
on
the
floor
right
in
front
of
it.
he
also
found
some
ammunition
seating.
he
said,
near
where
the
driver
would
sit
on
the
front
seat.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
saw
the
hole
in
the
car
in
the
highway.
at
the
time
he
saw
the
hole
in
the
car,
he
did
not
know
that
a
shot
have
been
fired
at
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
or
at
least
he
didn't
testify
that
he
knew
that.
but
presumably
by
the
time
he
made
the
search,
he
may
have
been
aware
that
there
was
in
fact
a
--
you
know
the
record
is
very
really
unclear
but
what
he
know
in
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
said
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
he
also
said
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
he
also
said
that
the
only
information
he
had
is
that
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
was
an
old
make
model
car
and
that
it
was
coming
in
his
direction.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
made
it
--
(voice
overlap)
okay.
alright,
he
may
have
made
that
assumption
but
at
the
time
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
fact.
he
apparently
did
not
know
that
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
have
been
shot
off.
now,
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
the
search
that
he
made,
he
made
at
the
jail
at
that
time
he
had
seen
the
hole
in
the
car.
at
that
time,
he
may
have
known
and
again
the
record
is
unclear.
he
may
have
known
what
to
make
a
model
of
the
car
was
at
the
time
he
made
the
search
because
the
record
does
not
reveal
when
that
information
was
imparted
to
him.
he
did
not
have
that
information
when
he
stopped
them
on
the
highway.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
from
the
time?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
know
in
minutes
how
long
it
was.
it
must
have
been
from
the
record
approximately
four
or
five
miles
to
the
jail.
it
may
have
been
less,
i'm
not
sure.
the
record
doesn't
say
in
miles
nor
does
it
say
in
time.
the
time
sequence
apparently
is
that
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
jail.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
to
the
jail
as
soon
as
sheriff
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
took
the
man
directly
to
the
jail,
sat
them
down
inside
the
jail.
said
to
the
man,
said
to
petitioner
mckinney,
you're
under
arrest
for
reckless
driving
and
as
he
testified
then
immediately
went
outside
and
searched
the
car.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
immediately
or
he
said
he
then
went
outside
and
searched
the
car.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
was
an
air
rifle.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that
an
air
rifle
can
be
slipped
under
the
front
of
most
cars.
i
don't
know
that
it
can't.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
it
was,
i
think
there
some
reference
to
his
being
a
sedan
but
i'm
not
sure.
at
any
rate,
sheriff
powers
was
quite
candid
about
this.
he
went
out
to
search
that
car.
he
didn't
go
out
there
and
roll
up
the
windows
and
happen
to
see
a
gun
seating
on
the
seat.
and
i
think
it's
very
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
it
shoots
at
least
to
hurt.
i
gather
it
is
a
less
destructive
weapon
than
a
normal
rifle
and
shoots
a
less
powerful
bullet.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
shoots
a
less
powerful
and
a
less
damaging
bullet
but
i
--
there
is
no
suggestion
by
the
petitioners
that
assuming
they
were
the
ones
who
did
it
that
this
was
not
a
serious
offense
that
they
would
have
committed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
now,
following
the
discovery
of
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
contempt
proceedings
were
bought
in
the
equity
court
of
mcminn
county,
tennessee
by
the
company.
in
tennessee
unlike
the
illinois
case
you
had
yesterday,
the
state
does
not
prosecute
criminal
contempt
the
party
who
got
the
injunction
does
in
this
case
the
company.
so,
the
company
brought
a
contempt
proceeding
and
they
had
a
contempt
citation
which
were
cited
that
these
people
have
gun
and
shot
into
a
house
and
that
because
they
had
gun
and
shot
into
a
house,
they
should
be
found
guilty
of
contempt.
a
trial
was
had
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
they
disobeyed
the
court
order
which
said
don't
hurt
people
or
threaten
to
harm
people
by
shooting
into
a
house.
the
citation
was
quite
explicit
to
these
people
have
shot
into
a
house
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
they
disobeyed
the
court
order.
now,
at
the
trial,
petitioners
asked
for
a
jury
trial.
it
was
denied,
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
were
introduced
into
evidence
over
the
objections
of
the
petitioners.
the
reason
given
by
the
chancellor
for
allowing
the
evidence
in
was
that
you
might
be
in
good
shape
in
criminal
court
but
this
is
not
a
criminal
court.
in
his
summation,
the
prosecutor
that
is
the
company
counsel
relied
very
heavily
on
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
these
petitioners
were
indeed
the
people
who
done
the
shooting.
the
chancellor
found
that
they
were
found
that
they
were
in
contempt
of
this
injunction
and
gave
them
the
maximum
sentence
permissible
under
tennessee
law
for
violation
--
for
one
violation
of
an
injunction
which
is
10
days
in
jail
and
a
$50.00
fine.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
absolute
--
that's
correct,
for
a
single
act
of
contempt
which
this
clearly
was.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
don't
know,
what
you
can
conclude
from
the
fact
that
they
make
that
the
maximum
penalty.
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
serious
offenses
which
because
they're
serious,
i'm
talking
now
on
the
criminal
context
not
criminal
contempt.
even
though
the
maximum
penalty
was
30
days,
this
was
a
serious
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
was
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen.
now,
whether
tennessee
thought
this
to
be
or
not
to
be
a
serious
offense,
i
would
want
to
characterize
that
but
they
have
a
maximum
penalty
of
10
days
and
a
$50.00
fine
for
each
single
act
of
contempt.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
would
be
stronger
if
we're
two
years
but
we
submit
that
it
would
be
nonetheless
should
reach
the
same
result
because
under
assuming
there's
a
sixth
amendment
application
to
criminal
contempt
proceedings
at
all,
the
standard
which
the
sixth
amendment
employs
for
determining
what
is
a
serious
offense
warning
a
jury
trial
is
not
primarily
the
severity
of
the
potential
sentence
if
one
looks
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
primary
emphasis
is
on
the
nature
of
the
offense.
this
is
repeatedly
emphasized
in
cohen,
in
cox
and
in
cohen
versus
wilson
which
was
the
first
to
these
cases.
the
court
said,
where
the
nature
of
the
offenses
such
that
a
common
law
it
was
indictable
and
that
it
is
malum
in
se
then
regardless
of
the
maximum
penalty
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
when
you
say
there's
a
misdemeanor
under
tennessee
well,
we
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
these
were
the
type
of
crime
which
are
prosecuted
criminally
would
not
entitle
you
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
we
would
concede
that
you're
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
either.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
crime
which
a
prosecuted
as
a
crime
would
not
under
the
sixth
amendment
entitle
you
to
a
jury
trial.
indeed,
because
it
is
malum
in
se
indictable
at
common
law
under
the
holding
of
this
court
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
potential
sentence.
it
is
a
crime
for
which
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
cheff
raises
another
point
and
it
really
comes
from
and
there's
a
lot
of
citation
of
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen.
in
cohen,
which
was
also
a
criminal
case,
this
court
said
even
where
we
have
an
offense
which
is
not
by
nature
indictable
at
the
common
law
or
malum
in
se,
in
other
words,
which
is
not
a
serious
offense
by
its
nature.
we
are
willing
to
take
a
look
as
an
alternative
basis
for
importing
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
potential
sentence.
in
other
words,
the
severity
of
the
sentence
which
the
legislature
has
announced,
it's
willing
to
impose
for
this
may
persuade
us
that
something
is
indeed
a
serious
offense
even
if
by
nature
it
was
not
a
serious
offense
at
the
common
law.
and
since
the
maximum
punishment
there
was
90
days,
they
said
we're
convinced,
that's
not
enough
to
convert
a
non-serious
offense
into
a
serious
one.
we
might
look
differently
upon
six
month.
now,
that
led
i
think
to
cheff
which
relies
on
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen
and
suggests
that
where
the
punishment
is
six
months
the
severity
of
such
that
at
the
very
least
in
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
this
court
is
going
to
say
there
should
be
a
jury
trial.
we
submit
that
that
holding
really
ought
to
be
constitutionally
derived.
we
don't
submit
that
cheff
in
fact
is
constitutionally
derived.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
i
suppose
a
contempt
as
such
and
this
was
the
theory
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
not
sure
that
the
nature
you
know,
i
don't
think
this
kind
of
a
distinction
has
a
recent
or
any
prior
case
in
this
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
had
to
face
the
fact,
for
example
if
someone
called
murder
disorderly
conduct
--
disorderly
conduct
were
defined
as
shooting
a
bullet
to
another
person
and
killing
him.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
the
maximum
is
five
years,
if
i'm
correct.
the
shooting
into
an
occupied
house
and
not
hitting
someone
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
what
we're
submitting,
yes.
and
primarily
for
this
reason,
i
think
this
case
is
different
from
bloom
because
of
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
the
problem
we
face
here
is
that
and
i
might
say
these
are
quite
common
in
labor
disputes.
i
think
in
every
labor
dispute
whenever
there's
any
minor
violence,
it's
quite
customary
to
get
an
injunction
against
violence.
well,
the
nature
of
that
injunction
and
that
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
old
common
law
rule
that
equity
does
not
enjoin
any
crime.
there,
has
developed
this
major
exception
in
labor
disputes.
every
time
an
injunction
of
that
nature
issues
and
it's
an
injunction
saying
do
not
commit
a
crime
and
quite
term
is
that.
i
mean
the
act
--
the
conduct
is
already
criminal.
all
that's
accomplished
by
getting
an
injunction
against
it
is
to
provide
a
second
way
to
prosecute
the
same
conduct.
it's
true
the
penalty
is
less.
it's
also
true
that
at
least
under
tennessee
law,
there's
no
double
jeopardy.
that
may
not
be
correct
under
federal
constitutional
law
but
these
defendants
in
fact
even
after
they
were
convicted
of
contempt
had
an
information
issued
against
them
for
the
crime.
they
were
indicted
but
information
was
issued.
it
was
ultimately
nolle
prosequi.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
an
injunction
enjoins
a
crime
that
unless
this
court
says
that
if
the
crime
what
entitles
you
to
a
jury
trial
the
violation
of
the
injunction
entitles
you
to
a
jury
trial.
we're
going
to
have
an
anomalous
situation
where
in
effect
simply
by
a
judge
showing
you
an
injunction
your
right
to
jury
trial
goes
out
the
window.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
because
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
the
crime
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
right.
but
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
and
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
is
that
in
mean
time
the
defendants
have
gone
to
jail
already
for
having
committed
the
act
and
they
have
not
had
a
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
for
committing
a
contempt
which
constituted
committing
a
criminal
act.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
actually,
under
tennessee
law
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
in
tennessee
he's
empowered
to
do
that.
it
happens
to
have
a
statute
that
says
the
maximum
penalty
is
10
days.
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
more
thing
about
this
and
then
get
into
search
and
seizure
which
we
regard
as
an
equally
important
issue.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
section
which
the
company
relied
upon
to
prosecute
the
contempt
was
section
c,
which
appears
on
page
2.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
which
enjoined
the
employees
from
inflicting
harm
or
damage
upon
the
person's
property
of
complainants-employees.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
all
that
enjoined
was
crime.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
among
what
it
enjoined
was
crimes
and
that
was
these
particular
petitioners
did
happens
to
be
one
of
the
things
that
are
crimes
that
are
enjoined.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
agree
that
that
you
have
completely
different
question
to
the
extent
somebody
violated
a
provision
of
this
injunction
which
was
not
criminal.
and
it
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
i
assume
if
you
can
make
the
sixth
amendment
case
out
of
--
well,
you
might,
you
might
not.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
then
you
have
to
go
right
to
the
severity
of
the
sentence
because
by
its
nature
obviously
this
would
not
be
something
the
sixth
--
that's
right,
the
sixth
amendment
would
apply
to.
i'd
like
to
move
if
i
may
to
the
search
and
seizure
point.
we
traveled
two
roads
to
what
we
think
is
an
inevitable
result
on
search
and
seizure
namely
that
this
search
was
unlawful.
one
road
is
to
line
up
preston
and
cooper
and
to
compare
the
factors
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
each
in
determining
that
a
search
and
warrant
was
reasonable
and
then
the
other
unreasonable
and
to
show
that
the
facts
of
this
case
the
search
was
clearly
unreasonable.
the
facts
are
like
preston
indeed
they're
hard
to
distinguish
from
preston
we
think.
and
let
me
deal
with
that
first
and
then
get
in
to
our
other
approach.
in
this
case,
like
preston,
the
search
took
place
at
a
later
time
at
another
place.
the
search
was
according
to
respondents
and
i
think
they're
probably
right.
the
search
was
incident
not
to
the
crime
for
which
they
were
arrested
which
is
reckless
driving
but
the
search
was
a
--
to
be
candid
i
think
was
in
order
to
find
evidence
to
link
these
people
to
the
shooting
but
they
had
not
be
arrested
for
the
shooting.
there
was
no
need
to
conduct
the
search
in
order
to
prevent
the
defendants
from
getting
access
to
weapons.
they
were
under
detention
inside
the
jail.
there
was
clearly
time
to
get
a
warrant.
this
is
not
an
--
from
what
we
can
see
in
this
record
and
impounding
case.
this
is
not
a
cooper
case
whereby
law,
the
police
are
required
to
impound
the
car
as
evidence
of
the
crime.
certainly,
tennessee
does
not
require
the
impounding
of
every
car
which
has
been
involved
in
the
reckless
driving
and
that
is
all
these
petitioners
have
been
arrested
for
the
time
of
search
was
conducted.
cooper
relied
very
heavily
we
think
set
it
on
the
proposition
that
the
search
was
for
evidence
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendants
were
arrested
and
that
the
police
were
required
to
impound
the
car
in
connection
with
the
offense
for
which
they
were
arrested
and
so
none
of
those
things
are
present
here
and
we
think
this
case
therefore
is
preston.
assuming
the
governing
standard
for
these
types
of
cases
is
to
line
up
and
continue
to
lineup
preston
and
cooper.
we
think
incidentally
that
cooper
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
don't
want
to
deny
it.
i
just
said
they
didn't
do
it.
i
don't
think
tennessee
law
provides
for
the
impounding
of
cars
involved
in
reckless
driving
and
i
don't
think
this
car
was
in
fact
impounded.
at
least
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
it
was.
it
was
brought
along
with
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
indeed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
suppose
that's
right.
i
don't
know
that
but
i
assume
that
it
is
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
that's
correct
unless,
they
were
going
to
deny
in
the
court.
now,
we
don't
know
that
they
did
deny
in
the
court
from
the
record
and
i'm
frank
to
say
that
i
don't
know
whether
in
fact
they
denied
it
to
them
after
he
was
released.
but
at
least
there
is
no
defense
made
in
this
case
of
the
search
that
this
was
an
impounded
car
and
we
think
that
clearly
makes
cooper
inapplicable.
our
other
approach
to
this
which
we
really
think
is
the
right
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
though
we
confess
this
court
has
sometimes
seem
denied
evidence,
sometime
not
is
that
searches
without
warrant
are
only
reasonable
or
to
put
it
in
a
words
of
katz
a
per
se
unreasonable
unless
you
have
one
of
the
already
clearly
enunciated,
clearly
established
exceptions
and
we
think
the
proper
definition
of
all
of
those
exceptions
the
proper
way
to
characterize
all
of
them,
is
the
way
they
were
characterized
in
the
mcdonald
case
and
they
have
sometimes
but
not
always
been
characterized
since
that
the
police
may
search
without
a
warrant
only
where
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
preclude
the
delay
necessary
to
obtain
a
warrant.
we
think
that
clearly
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
purpose,
one
of
the
central
purposes
is
to
insist
that
police
officers
get
warrants
before
they
search.
the
reason
we
insist
upon
that
is
to
interpose
a
neutral
magistrate
who
makes
subjective
decisions
about
whether
there's
enough
evidence
to
search.
the
exception
is
necessary
because
there
are
obviously
circumstances
where
it
is
not
convenient
or
possible
to
get
a
warrant
before
the
search
has
to
be
conducted.
there
are
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
moving
automobile
is
clearly
one
of
those.
an
automobile
at
rest
is
clearly
not
as
preston
suggested.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that's
right
although
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
as
this
court
has
often
suggested
all
the
police
need
have
done
was
guard
the
car
for
the
short
period
of
time
necessary
to
get
the
warrant.
now,
if
they
had
released
petitioner
mcmillan
and
he
had
headed
for
his
car
and
said,
bye,
i'm
going
to
take
my
car
home
now.
at
that
point,
i
would
say
they
no
longer
had
to
get
the
warrant
because
now
their
car
was
threatened.
now,
they
would've
lost
because
at
that
point
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
were
such
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
search.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
has
not
been
a
fundamental
aspect
to
this
case.
we
are
challenging
absence
of
warrant.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
concede
it.
it
is
not
been
the
major
emphasis
of
our
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
problem
with
the
record
is,
it
isn't
clear
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
not.
it
isn't
clear
what
they
knew
at
the
time
they
conducted
that
search
if
they
knew
the
car
that
involved
in
the
robbery
it
had
a
bullet
shot
in
the
back
and
that
it
was
a
1950
dodge
and
they
knew
it
was
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
say
that
it
has
not
been
made
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
principle
issue
in
this
case
has
been
whether
this
search
was
proper,
given
that
it
was
made
without
warrant.
and
our
principle
argument
is
that
any
search
without
a
warrant
is
per
se
improper
unless
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
were
such
that
it
was
not
possible
to
obtain
one.
we
submit
and
i
want
to
close
with
this
that
not
only
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
is
the
only
interpretation
that
is
going
to
make
law
enforcement
in
this
area
sensible.
as
long
as
there
are
epicycles
of
rules
of
reasonableness
which
depend
on
the
facts
of
each
case
which
has
mr.
justice
black
said
earlier
today
require
a
question
of
judgment
in
each
case.
police
are
going
to
make
mistakes
and
when
they
make
mistakes
they
can
be
good
faith
mistakes.
a
guilty
man
is
going
to
go
free
because
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
excluded.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
rule
of
punishment
and
yet
if
the
rules
remain
so
fuzzy
that
a
policeman
doesn't
know
what
his
obligations
are,
he
is
going
to
be
punished.
the
guilty
man
is
going
to
go
free
because
he
didn't
understand
the
rules.
the
mcdonald
rule,
the
rule
that
you
must
get
a
warrant
unless
the
circumstances
are
such
that
there
isn't
time
to
get
it
is
a
rule
that
a
policeman
can
understand
and
that
it
incorporates
what
are
now
six
different
rules
and
that
all
seem
to
stem
from
though
they
go
a
little
further.
it
incorporates
them
into
one
rule.
a
policeman
doesn't
have
to
have
a
form
book
of
the
latest
exceptions.
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
cooper
versus
california
was
decided
last
year
and
that
maybe
another
exception.
only
he
needs
to
know
is
that
my
guiding
star,
the
issue
for
me
to
decide
is
do
i
have
time
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
get
a
warrant
if
the
answer
is
yes,
i
must
get
it,
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
i
may
search
without
it
assuming
i
have
probable
cause.
and
that,
we
submit
is
the
standard
which
should
be
adopted
under
the
fourth
amendment
though
as
we
say
even
if
preston
and
cooper
remain
where
they
are
and
the
rule
is
still
reasonableness
and
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
we
submit
the
search
was
unreasonable.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
it's
clear
that
under
the
law,
the
exception
of
incidents
to
an
arrest.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
explained
to
his
dissent
for
raboniwitz
and
we
agree
with
to
that
extent
we're
urging
that
it
be
pushed
to
that
extent.
the
police
when
--
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
make
an
arrest
which
they
did
not
do
here
but
they
made
an
arrest
but
it
was
one
for
reckless
driving.
assuming
they
make
an
arrest
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
say
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
under
a
rabinowitz,
they
could
search
the
occupants
of
the
car
for
fear
that
a
weapon
would
be
pulled
and
they
could
search
so
much
of
the
car
as
the
occupants
could
reach
in
order
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence.
they
could
not
search
the
trunk.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
they
have
searched
it
on
the
highway,
they
would
not
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
at
that
time.
i
think
that's
a
clear
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
--
alright,
but
they
didn't
search
it
there
and
this
is
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
have
great
difficulty
with
that
case
under
either
theory
either
the
one
we
espouse
or
the
preston-cooper
theory.
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
assuming
that
reckless
driving
is
the
kind
of
crime
for
which
you
can
make
search
as
incident
to
an
arrest
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
clear.reckless
driving
here
was
speeding.
does
the
policeman
have
a
reasonable
basis
the
fear
that
if
he
stopped
a
speeder
a
gun
will
be
pulled?
assuming
it's
the
kind
of
crime
for
which
you
can
make
that
search
then
yes
if
they
found
the
gun
pursuant
to
that
search
it
would
under
either
theory
be
admissible
evidence.
we
submit
however
that
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
therefore
underneath
the
theory
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
have
a
little
trouble
when
you
put
in
those
terms
because
then
you're
saying
they
can
search
on
suspicion,
they
can
use
reckless
driving.
suppose
they
weren't
driving
70
miles
an
hour,
suppose
they
were
driving
within
the
speed
limit,
should
that
deny
the
police
search
which
your
honor
is
suggesting
they
otherwise
could
make?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
might
be
different.
i
would
be
worried
--
if
the
policeman
candidly
said,
i
wasn't
interested
in
searching
pursuant
to
an
arrest
for
reckless
driving.
i
use
this
as
an
excuse
to
search
for
evidence
to
verify
my
suspicion
that
they
were
involved
in
the
shooting.
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
serious
problems
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
he
to
say
that
that
was
his
motive.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
early
1960's.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
this
--
the
whole
thing
took
place
before
cooper
was
decided
and
cooper
was
not
relied
upon
even
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
because
they
didn't
know
that
it
existed
and
did
not

labor

and
all
of
the
consequences
of
the
labor
dispute
are
over
including
this
--
the

against
these
people
having
been

the
only
thing
that
lingers
from
that
dispute
is
this
pending

proceeding

the
potentiality
of

i
mean

of

mr.

they
have
not
served.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tennessee's
supreme
court
and
it
presents
two
issues.
each
of
which
has
been
discussed
at
some
length
already
this
week:
first,
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
at
least
certain
criminal
contempt
cases
and
second,
the
validity
of
the
search
without
warrant
of
an
automobile.
the
issues
arise
in
this
case
however
in
quite
a
different
context
and
since
that
context
may
shape
the
resolution,
i'd
like
to
describe
it
at
least
at
some
length.
we
begin
here
with
the
strike
being
under
taken
by
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company
against
the
company.
petitioners
were
striking
employees
of
the
company.
at
some
point
during
the
strike,
the
company
went
into
the
tennessee
court
of
equity.
they
are
still
separate
courts
in
tennessee
and
it
got
an
injunction
against
certain
conduct
by
the
striking
employees.
the
provisions
of
that
injunction
relevant
here
enjoined
conduct
which
quite
clearly
was
conduct
already
proscribed
by
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
of
tennessee
specifically
it
enjoined
the
striking
employees
from
injuring
or
harming
those
employees
of
the
company
who
came
to
work
or
visitors
or
other
people
who
may
come
to
the
company
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
now,
of
course
it's
undisputed
and
the
company
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
this
conduct
which
was
enjoined
and
indeed
for
which
the
petitioners
ultimately
were
tried
in
contempt
is
a
felony
under
the
state
law
of
tennessee.
sometime
after
the
injunction
was
issued
and
while
the
strike
was
continuing,
a
shot
was
fired
into
the
home
of
one
of
the
employees
who
was
working
during
the
strike.
this
home
was
some
25
miles
from
the
plant
in
the
next
county.
the
shot
was
fired
from
an
automobile
as
the
automobile
raced
away
the
occupants
of
the
house
returned
fire
and
manage
to
hit
the
car
with
one
bode
in
the
back.
deputy
sheriff
powers
who
is
a
sheriff
in
the
county
where
the
plant
is
located
and
who
was
at
the
time
the
record
doesn't
quite
clear
about
15
or
20
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
shooting,
received
the
report
over
his
radio
that
a
shooting
had
occurred
that
car
was
apparently
headed
in
the
direction
of
his
county
and
that
it
was
an
old
make
model
car.
he
expressly
testified
that
that
is
all
that
he
received
over
his
radio
in
terms
of
a
description
of
the
car
and
when
asked,
did
you
get
a
specific
description?
he
said,
no,
that's
all
i
got.
it
was
an
old
make
model
car.
as
he
was
driving
along,
he
saw
an
old
make
model
car
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
that
quite
equipped
and
he
turned
around
and
followed
it.
he
testified
that
was
going
some
78-80
miles
an
hour,
he
couldn't
catch
up
to
it
and
so
he
radio
the
head
to
the
police
in
the
next
town
which
happens
to
be
the
town
the
plant
is
located
in,
to
stop
the
car.
they
did
so
sheriff
powers
is
then
as
they
were
stopped,
caught
up,
pulled
up
along
side.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry.
did
who
saw?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
all
the
record
shows
sheriff
powers
says
he
radio
the
head
and
said
i'm
chasing
an
old
car
and
i
can't
catch
it
please
stop
it.
that's
all
he
recites
having
said.
he
did
testify
that
he
didn't
know
at
this
time
any
more
about
the
car
except
that
it
was
an
old
car.
to
that,
i
assume
is
all
that
he
could've
radio
the
head.
at
any
rate,
the
car
was
stopped
and
the
car
which
was
stopped
we
know
is
petitioner's
car.
sheriff
powers
pulled
up
alongside.
petitioners
were
still
sitting
in
the
car.
he
came
over,
there
was
apparently
a
brief
conversation
not
recorded.
at
the
end
of
which,
sheriff
powers
told
the
occupants
of
the
car
petitioners,
i'm
going
to
take
you
down
to
the
jail.
he
did
not
tell
them
what
the
ground
for
taking
them
was
he
just
said,
i'm
going
to
take
you
down
to
the
jail.
the
petitioners
came
out
of
their
car
and
apparently
we're
taken
in
sheriff
powers'
car
to
the
jail.
no
search
was
conducted
of
the
car
at
this
point
on
the
highway,
but
the
car
was
separately
brought
to
the
jail
and
was
parked
right
outside
the
front
door
of
the
jail.
sheriff
powers
then
testifies,
i
took
the
defendants
petitioners
inside
the
jail
and
sat
them
down
there.
i
told
petitioner
mckinney
who
was
the
driver
of
the
car
that
he
was
under
arrest
for
reckless
driving
and
i
then
went
outside
and
i
searched
the
car.
now,
there
is
no
contention
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
this
at
the
outset.
there's
no
suggestion,
this
was
an
administrative
search.
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
were
any
regulations
in
mcminn
county
tennessee
for
searching
every
car
that
was
impounded.
indeed,
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
this
car
was
impounded.
all
we
know
is
that
the
car
was
brought
to
the
jail
as
in
preston
that
was
the
case
and
as
the
court
suggested
in
preston
for
all
we
know
it
may
have
been
for
the
convenience
of
the
petitioners.
following
the
search
of
course
uncovered
a
gun
and
so
an
ammunition.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
at
that
point,
he
said
nothing
about
his
car.
he
later
said
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
record
isn't
clear
when
he
said
that
because
it
was
a
different
witness
who
testified
i
got
there
and
i
heard
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
isn't
clear
whether
he
said,
--
well,
he
said
it
before
the
search
was
conducted
or
after
the
search
was
conducted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
he
said
that.
the
witness
testified
that
the
petitioner
mckinney
seem
very
scared
and
he
said
i'll
leave
my
car
here
tonight.
i'll
leave
my
car.
and
that
was
the
testimony,
but
it's
not
clear
on
the
record
whether
that
was
said
before
or
after
sheriff
powers
went
out
and
searched
the
car.
in
any
rate,
sheriff
powers
did
testify
that
all
three
petitioners
were
under
restraint
inside
the
jail.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
gun
was
found
as
i
understand
it
under
the
front
right
seat.
i
gather
it
was
not
on
the
seat
but
underneath.
it
isn't
clear
whether
it
was
wedged
underneath
the
seat
or
simply
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
car
in
the
front
right
side.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
whether
it
could
or
not.
there
is
no
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
say,
i
don't
think
the
record
makes
that
clear,
all
sheriff
powers
says
is,
i
went
out
to
search
the
car.
he
was
purely
--
this
was
a
--
an
indiscriminate
or
at
least
the
complete
search
of
a
car
that
he
was
under
taking.
and
he
said
he
found
the
gun
under
the
front
right
seat.
i
think
those
were
the
words
and
as
i
say
it's
not
clear
whether
that
meant
physically
under
it
or
down
on
the
floor
right
in
front
of
it.
he
also
found
some
ammunition
seating.
he
said,
near
where
the
driver
would
sit
on
the
front
seat.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
saw
the
hole
in
the
car
in
the
highway.
at
the
time
he
saw
the
hole
in
the
car,
he
did
not
know
that
a
shot
have
been
fired
at
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
or
at
least
he
didn't
testify
that
he
knew
that.
but
presumably
by
the
time
he
made
the
search,
he
may
have
been
aware
that
there
was
in
fact
a
--
you
know
the
record
is
very
really
unclear
but
what
he
know
in
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
said
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
he
also
said
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
he
also
said
that
the
only
information
he
had
is
that
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
was
an
old
make
model
car
and
that
it
was
coming
in
his
direction.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
he
made
it
--
(voice
overlap)
okay.
alright,
he
may
have
made
that
assumption
but
at
the
time
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
fact.
he
apparently
did
not
know
that
the
car
involved
in
the
shooting
have
been
shot
off.
now,
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
the
search
that
he
made,
he
made
at
the
jail
at
that
time
he
had
seen
the
hole
in
the
car.
at
that
time,
he
may
have
known
and
again
the
record
is
unclear.
he
may
have
known
what
to
make
a
model
of
the
car
was
at
the
time
he
made
the
search
because
the
record
does
not
reveal
when
that
information
was
imparted
to
him.
he
did
not
have
that
information
when
he
stopped
them
on
the
highway.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
from
the
time?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
know
in
minutes
how
long
it
was.
it
must
have
been
from
the
record
approximately
four
or
five
miles
to
the
jail.
it
may
have
been
less,
i'm
not
sure.
the
record
doesn't
say
in
miles
nor
does
it
say
in
time.
the
time
sequence
apparently
is
that
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
jail.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
to
the
jail
as
soon
as
sheriff
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
took
the
man
directly
to
the
jail,
sat
them
down
inside
the
jail.
said
to
the
man,
said
to
petitioner
mckinney,
you're
under
arrest
for
reckless
driving
and
as
he
testified
then
immediately
went
outside
and
searched
the
car.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
immediately
or
he
said
he
then
went
outside
and
searched
the
car.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
was
an
air
rifle.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that
an
air
rifle
can
be
slipped
under
the
front
of
most
cars.
i
don't
know
that
it
can't.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
it
was,
i
think
there
some
reference
to
his
being
a
sedan
but
i'm
not
sure.
at
any
rate,
sheriff
powers
was
quite
candid
about
this.
he
went
out
to
search
that
car.
he
didn't
go
out
there
and
roll
up
the
windows
and
happen
to
see
a
gun
seating
on
the
seat.
and
i
think
it's
very
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
it
shoots
at
least
to
hurt.
i
gather
it
is
a
less
destructive
weapon
than
a
normal
rifle
and
shoots
a
less
powerful
bullet.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
shoots
a
less
powerful
and
a
less
damaging
bullet
but
i
--
there
is
no
suggestion
by
the
petitioners
that
assuming
they
were
the
ones
who
did
it
that
this
was
not
a
serious
offense
that
they
would
have
committed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
now,
following
the
discovery
of
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
contempt
proceedings
were
bought
in
the
equity
court
of
mcminn
county,
tennessee
by
the
company.
in
tennessee
unlike
the
illinois
case
you
had
yesterday,
the
state
does
not
prosecute
criminal
contempt
the
party
who
got
the
injunction
does
in
this
case
the
company.
so,
the
company
brought
a
contempt
proceeding
and
they
had
a
contempt
citation
which
were
cited
that
these
people
have
gun
and
shot
into
a
house
and
that
because
they
had
gun
and
shot
into
a
house,
they
should
be
found
guilty
of
contempt.
a
trial
was
had
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
they
disobeyed
the
court
order
which
said
don't
hurt
people
or
threaten
to
harm
people
by
shooting
into
a
house.
the
citation
was
quite
explicit
to
these
people
have
shot
into
a
house
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
they
disobeyed
the
court
order.
now,
at
the
trial,
petitioners
asked
for
a
jury
trial.
it
was
denied,
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
were
introduced
into
evidence
over
the
objections
of
the
petitioners.
the
reason
given
by
the
chancellor
for
allowing
the
evidence
in
was
that
you
might
be
in
good
shape
in
criminal
court
but
this
is
not
a
criminal
court.
in
his
summation,
the
prosecutor
that
is
the
company
counsel
relied
very
heavily
on
the
gun
and
the
ammunition
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
these
petitioners
were
indeed
the
people
who
done
the
shooting.
the
chancellor
found
that
they
were
found
that
they
were
in
contempt
of
this
injunction
and
gave
them
the
maximum
sentence
permissible
under
tennessee
law
for
violation
--
for
one
violation
of
an
injunction
which
is
10
days
in
jail
and
a
$50.00
fine.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
absolute
--
that's
correct,
for
a
single
act
of
contempt
which
this
clearly
was.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
don't
know,
what
you
can
conclude
from
the
fact
that
they
make
that
the
maximum
penalty.
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
serious
offenses
which
because
they're
serious,
i'm
talking
now
on
the
criminal
context
not
criminal
contempt.
even
though
the
maximum
penalty
was
30
days,
this
was
a
serious
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
was
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen.
now,
whether
tennessee
thought
this
to
be
or
not
to
be
a
serious
offense,
i
would
want
to
characterize
that
but
they
have
a
maximum
penalty
of
10
days
and
a
$50.00
fine
for
each
single
act
of
contempt.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
would
be
stronger
if
we're
two
years
but
we
submit
that
it
would
be
nonetheless
should
reach
the
same
result
because
under
assuming
there's
a
sixth
amendment
application
to
criminal
contempt
proceedings
at
all,
the
standard
which
the
sixth
amendment
employs
for
determining
what
is
a
serious
offense
warning
a
jury
trial
is
not
primarily
the
severity
of
the
potential
sentence
if
one
looks
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
primary
emphasis
is
on
the
nature
of
the
offense.
this
is
repeatedly
emphasized
in
cohen,
in
cox
and
in
cohen
versus
wilson
which
was
the
first
to
these
cases.
the
court
said,
where
the
nature
of
the
offenses
such
that
a
common
law
it
was
indictable
and
that
it
is
malum
in
se
then
regardless
of
the
maximum
penalty
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
when
you
say
there's
a
misdemeanor
under
tennessee
well,
we
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
these
were
the
type
of
crime
which
are
prosecuted
criminally
would
not
entitle
you
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
we
would
concede
that
you're
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
either.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
crime
which
a
prosecuted
as
a
crime
would
not
under
the
sixth
amendment
entitle
you
to
a
jury
trial.
indeed,
because
it
is
malum
in
se
indictable
at
common
law
under
the
holding
of
this
court
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
potential
sentence.
it
is
a
crime
for
which
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
cheff
raises
another
point
and
it
really
comes
from
and
there's
a
lot
of
citation
of
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen.
in
cohen,
which
was
also
a
criminal
case,
this
court
said
even
where
we
have
an
offense
which
is
not
by
nature
indictable
at
the
common
law
or
malum
in
se,
in
other
words,
which
is
not
a
serious
offense
by
its
nature.
we
are
willing
to
take
a
look
as
an
alternative
basis
for
importing
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
potential
sentence.
in
other
words,
the
severity
of
the
sentence
which
the
legislature
has
announced,
it's
willing
to
impose
for
this
may
persuade
us
that
something
is
indeed
a
serious
offense
even
if
by
nature
it
was
not
a
serious
offense
at
the
common
law.
and
since
the
maximum
punishment
there
was
90
days,
they
said
we're
convinced,
that's
not
enough
to
convert
a
non-serious
offense
into
a
serious
one.
we
might
look
differently
upon
six
month.
now,
that
led
i
think
to
cheff
which
relies
on
district
of
columbia
versus
cohen
and
suggests
that
where
the
punishment
is
six
months
the
severity
of
such
that
at
the
very
least
in
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
this
court
is
going
to
say
there
should
be
a
jury
trial.
we
submit
that
that
holding
really
ought
to
be
constitutionally
derived.
we
don't
submit
that
cheff
in
fact
is
constitutionally
derived.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
i
suppose
a
contempt
as
such
and
this
was
the
theory
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
not
sure
that
the
nature
you
know,
i
don't
think
this
kind
of
a
distinction
has
a
recent
or
any
prior
case
in
this
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
had
to
face
the
fact,
for
example
if
someone
called
murder
disorderly
conduct
--
disorderly
conduct
were
defined
as
shooting
a
bullet
to
another
person
and
killing
him.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
the
maximum
is
five
years,
if
i'm
correct.
the
shooting
into
an
occupied
house
and
not
hitting
someone
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
what
we're
submitting,
yes.
and
primarily
for
this
reason,
i
think
this
case
is
different
from
bloom
because
of
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
the
problem
we
face
here
is
that
and
i
might
say
these
are
quite
common
in
labor
disputes.
i
think
in
every
labor
dispute
whenever
there's
any
minor
violence,
it's
quite
customary
to
get
an
injunction
against
violence.
well,
the
nature
of
that
injunction
and
that
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
old
common
law
rule
that
equity
does
not
enjoin
any
crime.
there,
has
developed
this
major
exception
in
labor
disputes.
every
time
an
injunction
of
that
nature
issues
and
it's
an
injunction
saying
do
not
commit
a
crime
and
quite
term
is
that.
i
mean
the
act
--
the
conduct
is
already
criminal.
all
that's
accomplished
by
getting
an
injunction
against
it
is
to
provide
a
second
way
to
prosecute
the
same
conduct.
it's
true
the
penalty
is
less.
it's
also
true
that
at
least
under
tennessee
law,
there's
no
double
jeopardy.
that
may
not
be
correct
under
federal
constitutional
law
but
these
defendants
in
fact
even
after
they
were
convicted
of
contempt
had
an
information
issued
against
them
for
the
crime.
they
were
indicted
but
information
was
issued.
it
was
ultimately
nolle
prosequi.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
an
injunction
enjoins
a
crime
that
unless
this
court
says
that
if
the
crime
what
entitles
you
to
a
jury
trial
the
violation
of
the
injunction
entitles
you
to
a
jury
trial.
we're
going
to
have
an
anomalous
situation
where
in
effect
simply
by
a
judge
showing
you
an
injunction
your
right
to
jury
trial
goes
out
the
window.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
because
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
the
crime
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
right.
but
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
and
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
is
that
in
mean
time
the
defendants
have
gone
to
jail
already
for
having
committed
the
act
and
they
have
not
had
a
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
for
committing
a
contempt
which
constituted
committing
a
criminal
act.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
actually,
under
tennessee
law
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
in
tennessee
he's
empowered
to
do
that.
it
happens
to
have
a
statute
that
says
the
maximum
penalty
is
10
days.
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
more
thing
about
this
and
then
get
into
search
and
seizure
which
we
regard
as
an
equally
important
issue.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
section
which
the
company
relied
upon
to
prosecute
the
contempt
was
section
c,
which
appears
on
page
2.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
which
enjoined
the
employees
from
inflicting
harm
or
damage
upon
the
person's
property
of
complainants-employees.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
all
that
enjoined
was
crime.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
among
what
it
enjoined
was
crimes
and
that
was
these
particular
petitioners
did
happens
to
be
one
of
the
things
that
are
crimes
that
are
enjoined.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
agree
that
that
you
have
completely
different
question
to
the
extent
somebody
violated
a
provision
of
this
injunction
which
was
not
criminal.
and
it
would
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
i
assume
if
you
can
make
the
sixth
amendment
case
out
of
--
well,
you
might,
you
might
not.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
then
you
have
to
go
right
to
the
severity
of
the
sentence
because
by
its
nature
obviously
this
would
not
be
something
the
sixth
--
that's
right,
the
sixth
amendment
would
apply
to.
i'd
like
to
move
if
i
may
to
the
search
and
seizure
point.
we
traveled
two
roads
to
what
we
think
is
an
inevitable
result
on
search
and
seizure
namely
that
this
search
was
unlawful.
one
road
is
to
line
up
preston
and
cooper
and
to
compare
the
factors
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
each
in
determining
that
a
search
and
warrant
was
reasonable
and
then
the
other
unreasonable
and
to
show
that
the
facts
of
this
case
the
search
was
clearly
unreasonable.
the
facts
are
like
preston
indeed
they're
hard
to
distinguish
from
preston
we
think.
and
let
me
deal
with
that
first
and
then
get
in
to
our
other
approach.
in
this
case,
like
preston,
the
search
took
place
at
a
later
time
at
another
place.
the
search
was
according
to
respondents
and
i
think
they're
probably
right.
the
search
was
incident
not
to
the
crime
for
which
they
were
arrested
which
is
reckless
driving
but
the
search
was
a
--
to
be
candid
i
think
was
in
order
to
find
evidence
to
link
these
people
to
the
shooting
but
they
had
not
be
arrested
for
the
shooting.
there
was
no
need
to
conduct
the
search
in
order
to
prevent
the
defendants
from
getting
access
to
weapons.
they
were
under
detention
inside
the
jail.
there
was
clearly
time
to
get
a
warrant.
this
is
not
an
--
from
what
we
can
see
in
this
record
and
impounding
case.
this
is
not
a
cooper
case
whereby
law,
the
police
are
required
to
impound
the
car
as
evidence
of
the
crime.
certainly,
tennessee
does
not
require
the
impounding
of
every
car
which
has
been
involved
in
the
reckless
driving
and
that
is
all
these
petitioners
have
been
arrested
for
the
time
of
search
was
conducted.
cooper
relied
very
heavily
we
think
set
it
on
the
proposition
that
the
search
was
for
evidence
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendants
were
arrested
and
that
the
police
were
required
to
impound
the
car
in
connection
with
the
offense
for
which
they
were
arrested
and
so
none
of
those
things
are
present
here
and
we
think
this
case
therefore
is
preston.
assuming
the
governing
standard
for
these
types
of
cases
is
to
line
up
and
continue
to
lineup
preston
and
cooper.
we
think
incidentally
that
cooper
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
don't
want
to
deny
it.
i
just
said
they
didn't
do
it.
i
don't
think
tennessee
law
provides
for
the
impounding
of
cars
involved
in
reckless
driving
and
i
don't
think
this
car
was
in
fact
impounded.
at
least
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
it
was.
it
was
brought
along
with
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
indeed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
suppose
that's
right.
i
don't
know
that
but
i
assume
that
it
is
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
assume
that's
correct
unless,
they
were
going
to
deny
in
the
court.
now,
we
don't
know
that
they
did
deny
in
the
court
from
the
record
and
i'm
frank
to
say
that
i
don't
know
whether
in
fact
they
denied
it
to
them
after
he
was
released.
but
at
least
there
is
no
defense
made
in
this
case
of
the
search
that
this
was
an
impounded
car
and
we
think
that
clearly
makes
cooper
inapplicable.
our
other
approach
to
this
which
we
really
think
is
the
right
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
though
we
confess
this
court
has
sometimes
seem
denied
evidence,
sometime
not
is
that
searches
without
warrant
are
only
reasonable
or
to
put
it
in
a
words
of
katz
a
per
se
unreasonable
unless
you
have
one
of
the
already
clearly
enunciated,
clearly
established
exceptions
and
we
think
the
proper
definition
of
all
of
those
exceptions
the
proper
way
to
characterize
all
of
them,
is
the
way
they
were
characterized
in
the
mcdonald
case
and
they
have
sometimes
but
not
always
been
characterized
since
that
the
police
may
search
without
a
warrant
only
where
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
preclude
the
delay
necessary
to
obtain
a
warrant.
we
think
that
clearly
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
purpose,
one
of
the
central
purposes
is
to
insist
that
police
officers
get
warrants
before
they
search.
the
reason
we
insist
upon
that
is
to
interpose
a
neutral
magistrate
who
makes
subjective
decisions
about
whether
there's
enough
evidence
to
search.
the
exception
is
necessary
because
there
are
obviously
circumstances
where
it
is
not
convenient
or
possible
to
get
a
warrant
before
the
search
has
to
be
conducted.
there
are
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
moving
automobile
is
clearly
one
of
those.
an
automobile
at
rest
is
clearly
not
as
preston
suggested.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that's
right
although
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
as
this
court
has
often
suggested
all
the
police
need
have
done
was
guard
the
car
for
the
short
period
of
time
necessary
to
get
the
warrant.
now,
if
they
had
released
petitioner
mcmillan
and
he
had
headed
for
his
car
and
said,
bye,
i'm
going
to
take
my
car
home
now.
at
that
point,
i
would
say
they
no
longer
had
to
get
the
warrant
because
now
their
car
was
threatened.
now,
they
would've
lost
because
at
that
point
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
were
such
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
search.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
has
not
been
a
fundamental
aspect
to
this
case.
we
are
challenging
absence
of
warrant.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
don't
concede
it.
it
is
not
been
the
major
emphasis
of
our
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
problem
with
the
record
is,
it
isn't
clear
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
not.
it
isn't
clear
what
they
knew
at
the
time
they
conducted
that
search
if
they
knew
the
car
that
involved
in
the
robbery
it
had
a
bullet
shot
in
the
back
and
that
it
was
a
1950
dodge
and
they
knew
it
was
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
say
that
it
has
not
been
made
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
principle
issue
in
this
case
has
been
whether
this
search
was
proper,
given
that
it
was
made
without
warrant.
and
our
principle
argument
is
that
any
search
without
a
warrant
is
per
se
improper
unless
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
were
such
that
it
was
not
possible
to
obtain
one.
we
submit
and
i
want
to
close
with
this
that
not
only
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
is
the
only
interpretation
that
is
going
to
make
law
enforcement
in
this
area
sensible.
as
long
as
there
are
epicycles
of
rules
of
reasonableness
which
depend
on
the
facts
of
each
case
which
has
mr.
justice
black
said
earlier
today
require
a
question
of
judgment
in
each
case.
police
are
going
to
make
mistakes
and
when
they
make
mistakes
they
can
be
good
faith
mistakes.
a
guilty
man
is
going
to
go
free
because
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
excluded.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
rule
of
punishment
and
yet
if
the
rules
remain
so
fuzzy
that
a
policeman
doesn't
know
what
his
obligations
are,
he
is
going
to
be
punished.
the
guilty
man
is
going
to
go
free
because
he
didn't
understand
the
rules.
the
mcdonald
rule,
the
rule
that
you
must
get
a
warrant
unless
the
circumstances
are
such
that
there
isn't
time
to
get
it
is
a
rule
that
a
policeman
can
understand
and
that
it
incorporates
what
are
now
six
different
rules
and
that
all
seem
to
stem
from
though
they
go
a
little
further.
it
incorporates
them
into
one
rule.
a
policeman
doesn't
have
to
have
a
form
book
of
the
latest
exceptions.
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
cooper
versus
california
was
decided
last
year
and
that
maybe
another
exception.
only
he
needs
to
know
is
that
my
guiding
star,
the
issue
for
me
to
decide
is
do
i
have
time
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
get
a
warrant
if
the
answer
is
yes,
i
must
get
it,
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
i
may
search
without
it
assuming
i
have
probable
cause.
and
that,
we
submit
is
the
standard
which
should
be
adopted
under
the
fourth
amendment
though
as
we
say
even
if
preston
and
cooper
remain
where
they
are
and
the
rule
is
still
reasonableness
and
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
we
submit
the
search
was
unreasonable.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
it's
clear
that
under
the
law,
the
exception
of
incidents
to
an
arrest.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
explained
to
his
dissent
for
raboniwitz
and
we
agree
with
to
that
extent
we're
urging
that
it
be
pushed
to
that
extent.
the
police
when
--
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
make
an
arrest
which
they
did
not
do
here
but
they
made
an
arrest
but
it
was
one
for
reckless
driving.
assuming
they
make
an
arrest
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
say
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
under
a
rabinowitz,
they
could
search
the
occupants
of
the
car
for
fear
that
a
weapon
would
be
pulled
and
they
could
search
so
much
of
the
car
as
the
occupants
could
reach
in
order
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence.
they
could
not
search
the
trunk.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
they
have
searched
it
on
the
highway,
they
would
not
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
at
that
time.
i
think
that's
a
clear
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
--
alright,
but
they
didn't
search
it
there
and
this
is
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
have
great
difficulty
with
that
case
under
either
theory
either
the
one
we
espouse
or
the
preston-cooper
theory.
assuming
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
assuming
that
reckless
driving
is
the
kind
of
crime
for
which
you
can
make
search
as
incident
to
an
arrest
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
clear.reckless
driving
here
was
speeding.
does
the
policeman
have
a
reasonable
basis
the
fear
that
if
he
stopped
a
speeder
a
gun
will
be
pulled?
assuming
it's
the
kind
of
crime
for
which
you
can
make
that
search
then
yes
if
they
found
the
gun
pursuant
to
that
search
it
would
under
either
theory
be
admissible
evidence.
we
submit
however
that
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
therefore
underneath
the
theory
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
have
a
little
trouble
when
you
put
in
those
terms
because
then
you're
saying
they
can
search
on
suspicion,
they
can
use
reckless
driving.
suppose
they
weren't
driving
70
miles
an
hour,
suppose
they
were
driving
within
the
speed
limit,
should
that
deny
the
police
search
which
your
honor
is
suggesting
they
otherwise
could
make?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
might
be
different.
i
would
be
worried
--
if
the
policeman
candidly
said,
i
wasn't
interested
in
searching
pursuant
to
an
arrest
for
reckless
driving.
i
use
this
as
an
excuse
to
search
for
evidence
to
verify
my
suspicion
that
they
were
involved
in
the
shooting.
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
serious
problems
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
he
to
say
that
that
was
his
motive.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
early
1960's.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
this
--
the
whole
thing
took
place
before
cooper
was
decided
and
cooper
was
not
relied
upon
even
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
because
they
didn't
know
that
it
existed
and
did
not

h.
gottesman
labor
dispute
is
over
and
all
of
the
consequences
of
the
labor
dispute
are
over
including
this
--
the
information
against
these
people
having
been
nolle
prosequi.
the
only
thing
that
lingers
from
that
dispute
is
this
pending
contempt
proceeding
in
the
potentiality
of
the
