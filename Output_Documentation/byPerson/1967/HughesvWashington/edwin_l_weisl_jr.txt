mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
in
this
case
by
invitation
of
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
filing
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
when
our
views
were
asked
to
be
submitted
to
the
court
on
this
question.
our
examination
of
this
case
and
the
issue
presented
shows
a
very
substantial
federal
interest
in
its
outcome
which
i
would
like
to
elucidate
for
you
for
a
moment.
first
of
all
and
most
important,
the
federal
government
is
perhaps
the
largest
grantor
of
lands
on
the
pacific
coast
as
this
court
well
knows
his
republic
land
states
and
much
of
the
land
indeed
the
substantial
part
of
it
was
at
one
time
in
federal
ownership
prior
to
statehood.
therefore,
the
integrity
and
the
interpretation
of
federal
patents
of
land
is
here
in
question
and
has
been
placed
in
substantial
question
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
secondly,
the
federal
government
is
the
owner
at
the
present
time
of
considerable
waterfront
coastal
property,
literal
property
in
the
state
of
washington
some
200
miles.
most
important
of
all
in
this
connection
is
that
we
hold
much
of
this
land
and
trust
for
indian
tribes
and
under
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
as
they
now
exist
to
a
lot
lands
to
indians
over
the
years
and
make
them
the
actual
fee
owners.
the
fact
that
a
right
that
we
maintain
they
have
to
future
accretions
is
taken
away
by
this
case
or
will
be
when
the
allotment
is
made
constitutes
an
important
federal
problem
with
the
federal
government
here
as
trustee.
in
addition,
acquisitions
of
land
for
private
purposes
from
private
citizens
are
contemplated
if
the
rule
of
the
court
below
obtains
the
federal
government
will
not
be
able
to
get
these
future
accretions
without
purchasing
them
or
condemning
them
for
the
state
for
what
i
am
sure
is
a
not
inconsiderable
sum
of
money
in
view
of
the
historic
nature
of
this
coast
line
which
seems
to
be
characterize
by
daily
imperceptible
accretions
building
up
over
many
years
to
quite
sizeable
amounts
of
land.
the
law,
i
submit,
is
quite
clear
as
to
whether
these
accretions,
the
right
thereto
can
be
taken
away
by
state
action
when
they
derive
from
a
federal
patent
or
other
form
of
grant.
this
court
has
taken
up
this
issue
in
its
various
forms
on
many
occasions.
first,
let
me
say
that
this
court
has
considered
the
question
of
whether
a
right
to
a
future
accretion
is
a
vested
right,
one
that
continues
and
cannot
be
taken
away.
in
an
ancient
case,
the
county
of
st.
clair
cited
in
our
brief
that
this
decision
has
made
a
right
to
future
accretions
of
the
imperceptible
kind
is
deemed
to
be
an
inherent
right
of
the
ownership
of
property
as
to
what
law
obtains
this
court
in
the
borax
case
cited
many
times
in
all
briefs
before
you
has
decided
quite
clearly
that
when
a
federal
grant
is
being
interpreted
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
remains
the
owner
of
any
of
the
land
in
question,
the
measuring
line
as
between
tidal
waters
and
upland
waters
is
determined
by
federal
law.
and
in
borax,
that
measuring
line
was
held
to
be
the
line
of
being
high
tide
determined
in
accordance
with
proper
geological
measurement
which
is
i
submit
quite
capable
of
being
ascertain
under
current
practice.
i
add
parenthetically
that
borax
need
not
be
the
rule
forever
if
more
accurate
scientific
measurement
are
being
developed.
i'm
sure
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
that
case
simply
selected
this
rule
because
it
was
the
best
scientific
one
then
available.
borax
simply
fixed
that
line
as
between
an
upland
owner
and
the
state
as
owner
of
tide
lands.
it
wasn't
on
an
accretion
case.
however,
i
can
see
no
distinction
between
accretions
and
the
mere
fixing
of
the
line
between
the
upland
owner
and
the
state
as
the
owner
of
the
tide
lines.
the
consequences
to
each
party
in
both
borax
and
an
accretion
case
are
large
and
a
considerable
body
of
land
would
have
gone
to
the
upland
owner
under
his
contention
in
borax
had
the
line
not
been
fixed
where
it
was
in
accordance
with
federal
principles.
i
think
one
of
the
important
arguments
that
the
state
makes
contrary
to
our
rule
is
that
these
accretions
lie
in
the
future
and
that
many
things
can
intervene
so
that
these
accretions
will
never
occur.
they're
trying
to
equate
the
petitioner
mrs.
hughes
with
an
ordinary
riparian
owner
and
they
are
talking
about
riparian
rights
and
i
think
it
is
most
important
in
making
the
legal
distinction
in
deciding
this
case
to
realize
that
accretion
is
not
a
riparian
right
for
this
reason.
the
riparian
right
is
a
right
in
an
owner
bordering
on
stream,
bordering
on
a
body
of
navigable
water
to
make
some
use
of
that
water
of
his
location
as
against
other
private
owners.
he
can
build
here,
work
out
so
to
speak.
he
has
a
right
to
use
water
from
the
stream.
he
has
the
right
to
use
it
for
navigational
purposes
but
this
right,
it
has
long
been
held,
always
been
held
in
common
law
countries,
this
right
can
be
taken
away
when
the
sovereign
can
demonstrate
some
overriding
public
need
for
these
waters.
it
is
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
a
permissive
right
he
said
that
in
a
case
called
stevens
against
arnold
cited
in
our
brief
and
he
makes
this
very
important
distinction
which
is
now
very
important
in
the
hughes
case,
in
stevens
against
arnold
for
it
distinguishes
these
riparian
rights
of
which
i
have
spoken
as
permissive
rights
as
opposed
to
right
to
accretion
which
is
indicia
of
property.
another
point
strongly
favoring
the
federal
government's
position
here
and
the
application
of
federal
law
to
the
accretions
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
patent,
a
federal
instrument
and
it's
long
been
held
by
this
court
that
in
respect
to
federal
instruments,
federal
law
applies
as
cited
in
that
law
review
article,
professor
corker
has
cited
again
in
all
of
our
briefs.
he
realizes
that
there
is
certainly
a
clear
field
of
trust
aspect
to
a
federal
patent.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
--
although
i
think
this
court
is
foreclosed
from
going
into
the
interpretation
of
the
state
constitution
since
we
have
heard
from
their
highest
court.
i
do
not
read
that
constitution
to
deprive
an
upland
owner
of
the
right
to
future
accretion
as
i
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
the
essence
of
their
position
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
this
instance,
it
may
come
about
because
of
a
desire
to
extend
this
riparian
rights
concept
to
something
that
is
not
actually
such
a
right.
no
one
questions
the
state's
right
to
do
lake
water
to
prevent
future
accretions.
no
one
questions
the
state
right
to
deny
owner's
access
to
navigable
waters.
this
can
be
done
in
pursuance
of
a
public
purpose.
here,
however,
they
are
simply
saying
we're
redefining
a
boundary
which
in
the
federal
deed
was
expressed
as
the
pacific
ocean
which
federal
law
has
interpreted
to
mean
high
tide.
that
line
is
simply
moved
and
in
accordance
with
the
very
ancient
principles
that
everywhere
else
in
the
united
states
except
washington
continues
to
obtain,
they
are
saying
that
they
can
cut
it
off.
this,
i
submit,
they
cannot
do
and
one
of
their
justifications
for
cutting
off
or
attempting
to
cut
off
this
right
is
they
say
that
the
state
have
tide
lands
and
that
because
of
accretions,
these
tide
lands
have
been
taken
away
from
them.
this
has
deprived
the
state
of
their
equal
footing
with
other
states
to
own
their
own
tide
lands.
this
is
wrong
and
it's
wrong
for
a
very
simple
reason.
the
state
has
lost
no
tide
lands
whatsoever
as
a
result
of
these
accretions.
tide
lands
are
the
line
between
mean
high
tide
and
low
tide
as
they
exist
at
any
given
moment.
picture
if
you
will
a
moveable
--
a
belt
consisting
of
the
tide
lands
as
accretion
comes
to
the
shore,
this
belt
simply
moves
seaward.
low
tide
doesn't
stay
where
it
is
just
because
the
land
on
the
land
where
we
cited
accreted,
low
tide
is
probably
just
as
far
from
the
high
tide
line
as
it
was
before.
this
belt
has
simply
moved
out
to
sea.
and
i
submit
that
the
accretions
may
have
resulted
in
the
state
making
very
substantial
and
important
gains
to
its
title
because
as
that
line
of
low
water
moved
seaward
as
a
result
of
the
accretions,
the
three-mile
limit
of
that
state
as
defined
in
the
submerge
lands
act
moves
that
further
out
to
sea.
in
accordance
with
what
we
all
know
of
the
developing
exploration
for
and
discovery
of
the
valuable
minerals
in
this
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
sea
of
a
state.
these
accretions
may
result
in
the
state
gaining
until
it
reaches
for
itself
as
a
result
thereof.
the
state
by
this
case
in
hughes
is
merely
asking
to
obtain
more
at
both
ends
on
the
seaward
and
the
landward
side
of
its
tide
lands.
this
is
not
something
contemplated
by
pollard
against
hagen
which
simply
confirmed
to
the
states
their
tide
lands.
their
tide
lands
i
submit
still
exist.
their
tide
lands
have
not
been
in
any
way
diminished
by
the
accretions
and
the
state
here
has
attempted
to
obtain
valuable
shorefront
property
in
a
late
date
in
history
because
of
some
public
purpose
in
acquiring
such
shorefront.
it
is
an
excellent
way
of
doing
it
--
to
do
it
by
judicial
decree
rather
than
the
payment
of
just
compensation
by
condemnation.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
as
to
accretions,
the
law
was
that
the
upland
owner
was
entitled
thereto.
the
question
of
ownership
to
the
bed
of
the
navigable
stream
was
one
that
really
was
not
resolved
until
pollard
against
hagan.
i
believe
that
the
federal
government
in
certain
cases
thought
that
it
could
convey
to
upland
owners
the
streambed
and
i
think
the
brewer-elliott
case
which
we
cite
indicates
an
attempt
give
in,
in
as
part
of
the
streambed.
in
point
of
fact
that
pollard
came
along,
the
united
states
covered
that
it
was
holding
the
bed
of
navigable
streams
entrust
for
the
new
states
as
they
came
into
the
union
and
that
they
could
not
in
fact
convey
it
to
private
owner.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
it
is
necessary
that
they'd
be
distinguished.
i
don't
think
we're
under
any
difficulty
in
so
doing.
riparian
rights
really
are
akin
to
zoning
rights
and
the
whole
bundle
of
permissive
rights
that
a
property
owner
is
allowed
to
do
provided
it
does
not
interfere
with
some
greater
public
use.
accretion
really
is
a
boundary
question.
it's
not
a
question
of
what
the
owner
may
do
with
his
property.
not
a
question
to
what
extent
he
may
invade
tide
lands
for
the
purposes
valuable
to
him.
it
is
really
quite
a
different
thing.
the
state
very
ingeniously
in
the
court
below
i
think
try
to
equate
accretion
with
normal
riparian
rights
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
case.
i
--
i
earnestly
commend
mr.
justice
white
your
attention
to
stevens
against
arnold
where
justice
holmes
makes
that
very
distinction.
the
mere
fact
that
an
accretion
also
maybe
cut
off
by
the
exercise
of
the
state's
paramount
right
to
the
use
of
its
own
tide
lands,
i
don't
think
obtains
here.
the
state
has
not
chosen
to
do
that.
they
have
not
built
the
major
public
improvements
for
example
of
considerable
extents
so
as
to
cut
off
mrs.
hughes
and
her
co-owner
to
similar
property
from
the
pacific
ocean.
what
they
have
done
is
made
it
very
possible
for
some
new
private
owner
who
might
buy
from
the
state
to
build
in
front
of
her
despite
the
fact
that
her
boundary
is
suppose
to
be
in
her
grant,
in
her
federal
grant
of
the
pacific
ocean.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
chief
justice,
i
thank
you
and
the
court
for
this
additional
opportunity
to
state
that
i
am
very,
very
surprised
that
what
is
essentially
a
simple
issue,
has
become
deceivingly
so
difficult
when
the
government's
position
in
this
case
simply
is
that
they
vested
right
to
accretions
that
in
this
case
happens
to
arise
where
a
federal
patent
cannot
be
taken
away
by
legislative
fiat
such
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington
as
recently
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
hughes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
do
not
say
that
there
is
any
magic
in
the
fact
that
this
land
derives
from
a
federal
patent,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
upland
owners
had
as
an
indicia
of
their
ownership
of
land,
their
right
to
a
boundary
defined
in
the
pacific
ocean.
now,
whether
this
is
with
the
federal
patent
or
not,
it
isn't
in
this
instance
so
important
and
it
might
well
be
ownership
of
land
in
one
of
the
13
original
states
on
the
seashore.
the
state
then
by
constitution
comes
and
takes
this
away
which
has
been
long
held
to
be
a
vested
right
of
ownership
in
your
land.
your
own
land
on
the
pacific
ocean
under
the
rule
of
the
hughes
case
in
the
state
supreme
court
of
washington,
you
no
longer
do
own
land
on
the
ocean
you
own
land
quite
a
considerable
way
back
not
at
all
what
you
have
bought,
not
at
what
you
are
patented.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
think
that
if
the
state
purports
to
do
that
legislatively
that
it
involves
to
something
quite
different
than
a
mere
change
in
law.
it
amounts
to
a
taking
a
confiscation
of
property
which
the
fifth
amendment
requires
payment
for.
it
does
not
merely
change
the
rule
--
yes,
this
is
not
--
this
is
an
alternative
approach
to
the
hughes
case
if
you
might
say
land
can
be
taken,
we
never
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
first
of
all
because
it's
a
federal
patent,
we
do
have
a
federal
question
involved
but
i
say
even
if
that
were
not,
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
in
that
while
the
state
can't
take
it
away.
they
can
take
it
away
only
under
circumstances
where
just
compensation
is
due
and
wholly
and
this
is
something
which
stella
hughes
owns.
she
owns
her
rights
to
have
her
boundary
on
the
pacific
ocean.
the
extent
that
the
state
now
said,
we
own
the
land
between
the
pacific
ocean
and
some
of
the
line
that
pick
out
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
picked
out
here.
i
think
i
know
these
lines
of
vegetations.
you
own
--
you
do
no
longer
own
on
the
pacific
ocean.
your
property
is
no
longer
the
same
property
that
you
bought
and
paid
for
acquired
by
patent.
therefore,
mrs.
hughes
has
been
deprived
that
a
substantial
indicia
of
her
ownership.
the
value
of
her
property
was
no
doubt
that
it
wasn't
on
the
pacific
ocean.
that
i
think
is
the
sound
underlying
basis
for
the
common
law
of
accretions
which
is
applied
universally
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
common
law
countries
except
the
state
of
washington
since
hughes
which
was
a
holding
that
was
not
sound
and
based
in
the
interpretation
of
its
own
constitution.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
this.
the
property
is
acquired
and
owned
because
of
its
location
and
value.
you
buy
property
that
abuts
upon
a
river,
that
abuts
upon
an
ocean.
your
key
describes
it
as
such.
imperceptible
accretions
really
do
not
adversely
affect
anyone
else
to
that
extent
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
keep
your
property
abutting
upon
that
body
of
water.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
this
line
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no.
this
is
a
different
matter
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
a
different
matter
that
these
rights
are
rights
to
use
something
that
belongs
to
someone
else.
the
flow
of
the
stream,
the
depth
of
the
stream,
the
water
in
the
stream
doesn't
inherently
belong
to
you.
it
is
in
essence
sovereign
property
that
under
riparian
law
principles,
you
are
allowed
to
use
as
long
as
the
sovereign
doesn't
come
in
and
apply
to
a
higher
public
use.
riparian
rights
are
somewhat
like
what
you
are
permitted
to
do
under
zoning
laws
that
if
the
public
permits
you
to
do
this
until
such
time
that
the
public
has
a
greater
and
higher
use.
these
very
points
that
we
assume
will
soon
be
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
diagrams
i
believe
against
the
united
states
whether
the
compensation
must
be
paid
for
the
riparian
rights.
but
the
courts
in
dealing
with
these
two
questions,
is
accretion
a
vested
property
right?
is
it
like
riparian
rights
that
almost
universally
and
this
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
right
to
accretion
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
permissive
riparian
right
and
i
again
invite
--
earnestly
invite
this
court's
attention
to
stevens
and
arnold
in
which
mr.
justice
holmes
drew
that
distinction.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
say
that
indeed
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
it
was
the
federal
patent,
however,
i
will
say
that
i
believe
it
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
patent,
it
creates
a
somewhat
greater
compulsion
to
ensure
that
the
patentee
preserves
their
ownership
in
these
accretions.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
a
clear
field
principle
that
a
federal
deed
carries
with
it
federal
law
and
federal
interpretations
of
the
scope
and
extent
of
that
deed,
it
is
not
in
this
instance
do
similar
to
a
federal
check
which
was
held
to
be
subject
to
federal
law
principles
in
clear
fields.
we
have
this
additional
factor
of
the
federal
grant
but
i
really
do
feel
that
at
this
title
and
derived
elsewhere
with
the
same
principle
would
indeed
upon.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
in
either
they
--
excuse
me.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
upland
that
is
taken
away
by
sudden
movements
such
as
installation
of
breakwater,
dredging
and
what
have
you
ordinarily
does
not
affect
the
change
in
title.
this
type
of
change
is
calling
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
this
--
the
state
servitude
extends
to
the
use
of
the
waters
and
access
to
the
waters
alone
to
the
extent
that
uplands
are
inundated
or
suddenly
washed
away.
the
upland
owner
would
continue
to
have
title
down
to
the
point
where
its
uplands
originally
went.
this
would
be
--
if
they
are
swept
away
suddenly
a
so-called
evulsive
change.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
accretions
are
first
of
all
these
imperceptible
and
gradual
workings
of
the
natural
courses
of
the
sea
that
slowly
deposit
land
on
the
beach
and
it
didn't
accept
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
this
difficulty
mr.
justice
fortas
because
of
this
long
belief
that
the
rights
to
accretions
have
vested
the
property
right
whereas
these
riparian
rights
to
use
the
water
to
take
it
for
drinking
and
agricultural
purposes
to
build
up
here
out
into
what
you
do
not
own
but
into
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream.
of
all
this
would
be
held
to
be
a
permissive
right
because
you
may
at
some
point
in
exercising
this
permissive
right
be
interfering
with
a
higher
and
more
important
sovereign
use
for
the
navigable
water.
that
came
--
that
issue
is
not
presented
here
but
we're
talking
about
the
sovereign
trying
to
use
uplands
not
part
of
its
tidelands,
uplands
which
under
any
traditional
view
of
just
compensation
and
sovereign
--
imminent
on
the
law
must
be
bought
and
pay
for
if
it
is
to
be
taken
from
a
private
owner.
i
admit
that
the
state
that
extinguished
the
value
to
mrs.
hughes
of
being
on
the
pacific
ocean
by
building
the
breakwater,
by
putting
up
signs
saying
mrs.
hughes
--
no
one
permits
mrs.
hughes
traveling
bays
in
the
pacific.
in
general,
however,
when
the
state
does
such
a
thing
involves
large
expenditures
of
public
fund,
the
legislative
decision
to
go
forward
with
major
projects,
a
clear
and
manifest
intent
of
the
state
to
dedicate
its
tidelands
to
a
present
and
impressive
private
deed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
three
answers
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
first
in
the
case
of
hughes
against
washington
as
mrs.
hughes'
land
disregarding
all
others,
i
think
the
federal
government
has
some
obligation
as
grantor
to
see
that
its
grantees
receive
what
the
government
in
fact
gave
them
that
it
may
be
a
moral
and
not
of
legal
obligation.
that
i
think
would
justify
our
views
to
this
court
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
of
course
--
of
course.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
of
course,
but
we
want
to
make
sure
that
they
get
everything
that
at
that
time
they
were
entitled
to
have.
our
second
interest
is
perspective.
we
are
the
owner,
the
united
states
of
considerable
uplands
on
the
pacific
ocean
and
not
as
i
stated
in
my
principal
argument,
some
of
this
land
has
owned
in
trust
for
indians.
eventually,
this
land
will
be
patented
or
allotted
to
these
indians
and
they
will
then
become
the
private
owners.
we
want
to
ensure
now
that
these
indians
will
receive
what
they
presently
have
as
beneficial
owners
when
they
become
the
legal
owners
with
the
right
of
these
accretions
which
the
workings
of
the
pacific
have
demonstrated
will
occur.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
not
at
all.
we
simply
say
that
whoever
owns
the
beach
must
acquire
it
through
legal
proper
means
if
it
is
by
a
public
body
and
the
public
body
should
pay
for
it
under
an
imminent
domain
principle,
if
under
the
law
they
do
not
own
it.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
my
third
point
is
that
the
government
is
making
substantial
park
and
recreation
land
acquisitions
on
the
pacific
coast.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
i
did
mentioned
that
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
said
some
of
that
was
indian
land
where
we
might
have
a
future
problem
that
is
already
dedicated
to
the
governmental
use
which
is
very
important
with
united
states
and
the
present
law.
i
thank
the
court.
and
i
trust
that
i
have
not
added
to
the
confusion
with
this
very
difficult
point.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
in
this
case
by
invitation
of
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
filing
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
when
our
views
were
asked
to
be
submitted
to
the
court
on
this
question.
our
examination
of
this
case
and
the
issue
presented
shows
a
very
substantial
federal
interest
in
its
outcome
which
i
would
like
to
elucidate
for
you
for
a
moment.
first
of
all
and
most
important,
the
federal
government
is
perhaps
the
largest
grantor
of
lands
on
the
pacific
coast
as
this
court
well
knows
his
republic
land
states
and
much
of
the
land
indeed
the
substantial
part
of
it
was
at
one
time
in
federal
ownership
prior
to
statehood.
therefore,
the
integrity
and
the
interpretation
of
federal
patents
of
land
is
here
in
question
and
has
been
placed
in
substantial
question
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
secondly,
the
federal
government
is
the
owner
at
the
present
time
of
considerable
waterfront
coastal
property,
literal
property
in
the
state
of
washington
some
200
miles.
most
important
of
all
in
this
connection
is
that
we
hold
much
of
this
land
and
trust
for
indian
tribes
and
under
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
as
they
now
exist
to
a
lot
lands
to
indians
over
the
years
and
make
them
the
actual
fee
owners.
the
fact
that
a
right
that
we
maintain
they
have
to
future
accretions
is
taken
away
by
this
case
or
will
be
when
the
allotment
is
made
constitutes
an
important
federal
problem
with
the
federal
government
here
as
trustee.
in
addition,
acquisitions
of
land
for
private
purposes
from
private
citizens
are
contemplated
if
the
rule
of
the
court
below
obtains
the
federal
government
will
not
be
able
to
get
these
future
accretions
without
purchasing
them
or
condemning
them
for
the
state
for
what
i
am
sure
is
a
not
inconsiderable
sum
of
money
in
view
of
the
historic
nature
of
this
coast
line
which
seems
to
be
characterize
by
daily
imperceptible
accretions
building
up
over
many
years
to
quite
sizeable
amounts
of
land.
the
law,
i
submit,
is
quite
clear
as
to
whether
these
accretions,
the
right
thereto
can
be
taken
away
by
state
action
when
they
derive
from
a
federal
patent
or
other
form
of
grant.
this
court
has
taken
up
this
issue
in
its
various
forms
on
many
occasions.
first,
let
me
say
that
this
court
has
considered
the
question
of
whether
a
right
to
a
future
accretion
is
a
vested
right,
one
that
continues
and
cannot
be
taken
away.
in
an
ancient
case,
the
county
of
st.
clair
cited
in
our
brief
that
this
decision
has
made
a
right
to
future
accretions
of
the
imperceptible
kind
is
deemed
to
be
an
inherent
right
of
the
ownership
of
property
as
to
what
law
obtains
this
court
in
the
borax
case
cited
many
times
in
all
briefs
before
you
has
decided
quite
clearly
that
when
a
federal
grant
is
being
interpreted
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
remains
the
owner
of
any
of
the
land
in
question,
the
measuring
line
as
between
tidal
waters
and
upland
waters
is
determined
by
federal
law.
and
in
borax,
that
measuring
line
was
held
to
be
the
line
of
being
high
tide
determined
in
accordance
with
proper
geological
measurement
which
is
i
submit
quite
capable
of
being
ascertain
under
current
practice.
i
add
parenthetically
that
borax
need
not
be
the
rule
forever
if
more
accurate
scientific
measurement
are
being
developed.
i'm
sure
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
that
case
simply
selected
this
rule
because
it
was
the
best
scientific
one
then
available.
borax
simply
fixed
that
line
as
between
an
upland
owner
and
the
state
as
owner
of
tide
lands.
it
wasn't
on
an
accretion
case.
however,
i
can
see
no
distinction
between
accretions
and
the
mere
fixing
of
the
line
between
the
upland
owner
and
the
state
as
the
owner
of
the
tide
lines.
the
consequences
to
each
party
in
both
borax
and
an
accretion
case
are
large
and
a
considerable
body
of
land
would
have
gone
to
the
upland
owner
under
his
contention
in
borax
had
the
line
not
been
fixed
where
it
was
in
accordance
with
federal
principles.
i
think
one
of
the
important
arguments
that
the
state
makes
contrary
to
our
rule
is
that
these
accretions
lie
in
the
future
and
that
many
things
can
intervene
so
that
these
accretions
will
never
occur.
they're
trying
to
equate
the
petitioner
mrs.
hughes
with
an
ordinary
riparian
owner
and
they
are
talking
about
riparian
rights
and
i
think
it
is
most
important
in
making
the
legal
distinction
in
deciding
this
case
to
realize
that
accretion
is
not
a
riparian
right
for
this
reason.
the
riparian
right
is
a
right
in
an
owner
bordering
on
stream,
bordering
on
a
body
of
navigable
water
to
make
some
use
of
that
water
of
his
location
as
against
other
private
owners.
he
can
build
here,
work
out
so
to
speak.
he
has
a
right
to
use
water
from
the
stream.
he
has
the
right
to
use
it
for
navigational
purposes
but
this
right,
it
has
long
been
held,
always
been
held
in
common
law
countries,
this
right
can
be
taken
away
when
the
sovereign
can
demonstrate
some
overriding
public
need
for
these
waters.
it
is
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
a
permissive
right
he
said
that
in
a
case
called
stevens
against
arnold
cited
in
our
brief
and
he
makes
this
very
important
distinction
which
is
now
very
important
in
the
hughes
case,
in
stevens
against
arnold
for
it
distinguishes
these
riparian
rights
of
which
i
have
spoken
as
permissive
rights
as
opposed
to
right
to
accretion
which
is
indicia
of
property.
another
point
strongly
favoring
the
federal
government's
position
here
and
the
application
of
federal
law
to
the
accretions
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
patent,
a
federal
instrument
and
it's
long
been
held
by
this
court
that
in
respect
to
federal
instruments,
federal
law
applies
as
cited
in
that
law
review
article,
professor
corker
has
cited
again
in
all
of
our
briefs.
he
realizes
that
there
is
certainly
a
clear
field
of
trust
aspect
to
a
federal
patent.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
--
although
i
think
this
court
is
foreclosed
from
going
into
the
interpretation
of
the
state
constitution
since
we
have
heard
from
their
highest
court.
i
do
not
read
that
constitution
to
deprive
an
upland
owner
of
the
right
to
future
accretion
as
i
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
the
essence
of
their
position
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
this
instance,
it
may
come
about
because
of
a
desire
to
extend
this
riparian
rights
concept
to
something
that
is
not
actually
such
a
right.
no
one
questions
the
state's
right
to
do
lake
water
to
prevent
future
accretions.
no
one
questions
the
state
right
to
deny
owner's
access
to
navigable
waters.
this
can
be
done
in
pursuance
of
a
public
purpose.
here,
however,
they
are
simply
saying
we're
redefining
a
boundary
which
in
the
federal
deed
was
expressed
as
the
pacific
ocean
which
federal
law
has
interpreted
to
mean
high
tide.
that
line
is
simply
moved
and
in
accordance
with
the
very
ancient
principles
that
everywhere
else
in
the
united
states
except
washington
continues
to
obtain,
they
are
saying
that
they
can
cut
it
off.
this,
i
submit,
they
cannot
do
and
one
of
their
justifications
for
cutting
off
or
attempting
to
cut
off
this
right
is
they
say
that
the
state
have
tide
lands
and
that
because
of
accretions,
these
tide
lands
have
been
taken
away
from
them.
this
has
deprived
the
state
of
their
equal
footing
with
other
states
to
own
their
own
tide
lands.
this
is
wrong
and
it's
wrong
for
a
very
simple
reason.
the
state
has
lost
no
tide
lands
whatsoever
as
a
result
of
these
accretions.
tide
lands
are
the
line
between
mean
high
tide
and
low
tide
as
they
exist
at
any
given
moment.
picture
if
you
will
a
moveable
--
a
belt
consisting
of
the
tide
lands
as
accretion
comes
to
the
shore,
this
belt
simply
moves
seaward.
low
tide
doesn't
stay
where
it
is
just
because
the
land
on
the
land
where
we
cited
accreted,
low
tide
is
probably
just
as
far
from
the
high
tide
line
as
it
was
before.
this
belt
has
simply
moved
out
to
sea.
and
i
submit
that
the
accretions
may
have
resulted
in
the
state
making
very
substantial
and
important
gains
to
its
title
because
as
that
line
of
low
water
moved
seaward
as
a
result
of
the
accretions,
the
three-mile
limit
of
that
state
as
defined
in
the
submerge
lands
act
moves
that
further
out
to
sea.
in
accordance
with
what
we
all
know
of
the
developing
exploration
for
and
discovery
of
the
valuable
minerals
in
this
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
sea
of
a
state.
these
accretions
may
result
in
the
state
gaining
until
it
reaches
for
itself
as
a
result
thereof.
the
state
by
this
case
in
hughes
is
merely
asking
to
obtain
more
at
both
ends
on
the
seaward
and
the
landward
side
of
its
tide
lands.
this
is
not
something
contemplated
by
pollard
against
hagen
which
simply
confirmed
to
the
states
their
tide
lands.
their
tide
lands
i
submit
still
exist.
their
tide
lands
have
not
been
in
any
way
diminished
by
the
accretions
and
the
state
here
has
attempted
to
obtain
valuable
shorefront
property
in
a
late
date
in
history
because
of
some
public
purpose
in
acquiring
such
shorefront.
it
is
an
excellent
way
of
doing
it
--
to
do
it
by
judicial
decree
rather
than
the
payment
of
just
compensation
by
condemnation.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
as
to
accretions,
the
law
was
that
the
upland
owner
was
entitled
thereto.
the
question
of
ownership
to
the
bed
of
the
navigable
stream
was
one
that
really
was
not
resolved
until
pollard
against
hagan.
i
believe
that
the
federal
government
in
certain
cases
thought
that
it
could
convey
to
upland
owners
the
streambed
and
i
think
the
brewer-elliott
case
which
we
cite
indicates
an
attempt
give
in,
in
as
part
of
the
streambed.
in
point
of
fact
that
pollard
came
along,
the
united
states
covered
that
it
was
holding
the
bed
of
navigable
streams
entrust
for
the
new
states
as
they
came
into
the
union
and
that
they
could
not
in
fact
convey
it
to
private
owner.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
it
is
necessary
that
they'd
be
distinguished.
i
don't
think
we're
under
any
difficulty
in
so
doing.
riparian
rights
really
are
akin
to
zoning
rights
and
the
whole
bundle
of
permissive
rights
that
a
property
owner
is
allowed
to
do
provided
it
does
not
interfere
with
some
greater
public
use.
accretion
really
is
a
boundary
question.
it's
not
a
question
of
what
the
owner
may
do
with
his
property.
not
a
question
to
what
extent
he
may
invade
tide
lands
for
the
purposes
valuable
to
him.
it
is
really
quite
a
different
thing.
the
state
very
ingeniously
in
the
court
below
i
think
try
to
equate
accretion
with
normal
riparian
rights
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
case.
i
--
i
earnestly
commend
mr.
justice
white
your
attention
to
stevens
against
arnold
where
justice
holmes
makes
that
very
distinction.
the
mere
fact
that
an
accretion
also
maybe
cut
off
by
the
exercise
of
the
state's
paramount
right
to
the
use
of
its
own
tide
lands,
i
don't
think
obtains
here.
the
state
has
not
chosen
to
do
that.
they
have
not
built
the
major
public
improvements
for
example
of
considerable
extents
so
as
to
cut
off
mrs.
hughes
and
her
co-owner
to
similar
property
from
the
pacific
ocean.
what
they
have
done
is
made
it
very
possible
for
some
new
private
owner
who
might
buy
from
the
state
to
build
in
front
of
her
despite
the
fact
that
her
boundary
is
suppose
to
be
in
her
grant,
in
her
federal
grant
of
the
pacific
ocean.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
chief
justice,
i
thank
you
and
the
court
for
this
additional
opportunity
to
state
that
i
am
very,
very
surprised
that
what
is
essentially
a
simple
issue,
has
become
deceivingly
so
difficult
when
the
government's
position
in
this
case
simply
is
that
they
vested
right
to
accretions
that
in
this
case
happens
to
arise
where
a
federal
patent
cannot
be
taken
away
by
legislative
fiat
such
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington
as
recently
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
hughes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
do
not
say
that
there
is
any
magic
in
the
fact
that
this
land
derives
from
a
federal
patent,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
upland
owners
had
as
an
indicia
of
their
ownership
of
land,
their
right
to
a
boundary
defined
in
the
pacific
ocean.
now,
whether
this
is
with
the
federal
patent
or
not,
it
isn't
in
this
instance
so
important
and
it
might
well
be
ownership
of
land
in
one
of
the
13
original
states
on
the
seashore.
the
state
then
by
constitution
comes
and
takes
this
away
which
has
been
long
held
to
be
a
vested
right
of
ownership
in
your
land.
your
own
land
on
the
pacific
ocean
under
the
rule
of
the
hughes
case
in
the
state
supreme
court
of
washington,
you
no
longer
do
own
land
on
the
ocean
you
own
land
quite
a
considerable
way
back
not
at
all
what
you
have
bought,
not
at
what
you
are
patented.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
think
that
if
the
state
purports
to
do
that
legislatively
that
it
involves
to
something
quite
different
than
a
mere
change
in
law.
it
amounts
to
a
taking
a
confiscation
of
property
which
the
fifth
amendment
requires
payment
for.
it
does
not
merely
change
the
rule
--
yes,
this
is
not
--
this
is
an
alternative
approach
to
the
hughes
case
if
you
might
say
land
can
be
taken,
we
never
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
first
of
all
because
it's
a
federal
patent,
we
do
have
a
federal
question
involved
but
i
say
even
if
that
were
not,
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
in
that
while
the
state
can't
take
it
away.
they
can
take
it
away
only
under
circumstances
where
just
compensation
is
due
and
wholly
and
this
is
something
which
stella
hughes
owns.
she
owns
her
rights
to
have
her
boundary
on
the
pacific
ocean.
the
extent
that
the
state
now
said,
we
own
the
land
between
the
pacific
ocean
and
some
of
the
line
that
pick
out
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
picked
out
here.
i
think
i
know
these
lines
of
vegetations.
you
own
--
you
do
no
longer
own
on
the
pacific
ocean.
your
property
is
no
longer
the
same
property
that
you
bought
and
paid
for
acquired
by
patent.
therefore,
mrs.
hughes
has
been
deprived
that
a
substantial
indicia
of
her
ownership.
the
value
of
her
property
was
no
doubt
that
it
wasn't
on
the
pacific
ocean.
that
i
think
is
the
sound
underlying
basis
for
the
common
law
of
accretions
which
is
applied
universally
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
common
law
countries
except
the
state
of
washington
since
hughes
which
was
a
holding
that
was
not
sound
and
based
in
the
interpretation
of
its
own
constitution.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
this.
the
property
is
acquired
and
owned
because
of
its
location
and
value.
you
buy
property
that
abuts
upon
a
river,
that
abuts
upon
an
ocean.
your
key
describes
it
as
such.
imperceptible
accretions
really
do
not
adversely
affect
anyone
else
to
that
extent
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
keep
your
property
abutting
upon
that
body
of
water.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
this
line
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no.
this
is
a
different
matter
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
a
different
matter
that
these
rights
are
rights
to
use
something
that
belongs
to
someone
else.
the
flow
of
the
stream,
the
depth
of
the
stream,
the
water
in
the
stream
doesn't
inherently
belong
to
you.
it
is
in
essence
sovereign
property
that
under
riparian
law
principles,
you
are
allowed
to
use
as
long
as
the
sovereign
doesn't
come
in
and
apply
to
a
higher
public
use.
riparian
rights
are
somewhat
like
what
you
are
permitted
to
do
under
zoning
laws
that
if
the
public
permits
you
to
do
this
until
such
time
that
the
public
has
a
greater
and
higher
use.
these
very
points
that
we
assume
will
soon
be
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
diagrams
i
believe
against
the
united
states
whether
the
compensation
must
be
paid
for
the
riparian
rights.
but
the
courts
in
dealing
with
these
two
questions,
is
accretion
a
vested
property
right?
is
it
like
riparian
rights
that
almost
universally
and
this
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
right
to
accretion
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
permissive
riparian
right
and
i
again
invite
--
earnestly
invite
this
court's
attention
to
stevens
and
arnold
in
which
mr.
justice
holmes
drew
that
distinction.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
say
that
indeed
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
it
was
the
federal
patent,
however,
i
will
say
that
i
believe
it
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
patent,
it
creates
a
somewhat
greater
compulsion
to
ensure
that
the
patentee
preserves
their
ownership
in
these
accretions.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
a
clear
field
principle
that
a
federal
deed
carries
with
it
federal
law
and
federal
interpretations
of
the
scope
and
extent
of
that
deed,
it
is
not
in
this
instance
do
similar
to
a
federal
check
which
was
held
to
be
subject
to
federal
law
principles
in
clear
fields.
we
have
this
additional
factor
of
the
federal
grant
but
i
really
do
feel
that
at
this
title
and
derived
elsewhere
with
the
same
principle
would
indeed
upon.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
in
either
they
--
excuse
me.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
upland
that
is
taken
away
by
sudden
movements
such
as
installation
of
breakwater,
dredging
and
what
have
you
ordinarily
does
not
affect
the
change
in
title.
this
type
of
change
is
calling
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
this
--
the
state
servitude
extends
to
the
use
of
the
waters
and
access
to
the
waters
alone
to
the
extent
that
uplands
are
inundated
or
suddenly
washed
away.
the
upland
owner
would
continue
to
have
title
down
to
the
point
where
its
uplands
originally
went.
this
would
be
--
if
they
are
swept
away
suddenly
a
so-called
evulsive
change.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
accretions
are
first
of
all
these
imperceptible
and
gradual
workings
of
the
natural
courses
of
the
sea
that
slowly
deposit
land
on
the
beach
and
it
didn't
accept
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
this
difficulty
mr.
justice
fortas
because
of
this
long
belief
that
the
rights
to
accretions
have
vested
the
property
right
whereas
these
riparian
rights
to
use
the
water
to
take
it
for
drinking
and
agricultural
purposes
to
build
up
here
out
into
what
you
do
not
own
but
into
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream.
of
all
this
would
be
held
to
be
a
permissive
right
because
you
may
at
some
point
in
exercising
this
permissive
right
be
interfering
with
a
higher
and
more
important
sovereign
use
for
the
navigable
water.
that
came
--
that
issue
is
not
presented
here
but
we're
talking
about
the
sovereign
trying
to
use
uplands
not
part
of
its
tidelands,
uplands
which
under
any
traditional
view
of
just
compensation
and
sovereign
--
imminent
on
the
law
must
be
bought
and
pay
for
if
it
is
to
be
taken
from
a
private
owner.
i
admit
that
the
state
that
extinguished
the
value
to
mrs.
hughes
of
being
on
the
pacific
ocean
by
building
the
breakwater,
by
putting
up
signs
saying
mrs.
hughes
--
no
one
permits
mrs.
hughes
traveling
bays
in
the
pacific.
in
general,
however,
when
the
state
does
such
a
thing
involves
large
expenditures
of
public
fund,
the
legislative
decision
to
go
forward
with
major
projects,
a
clear
and
manifest
intent
of
the
state
to
dedicate
its
tidelands
to
a
present
and
impressive
private
deed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
three
answers
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
first
in
the
case
of
hughes
against
washington
as
mrs.
hughes'
land
disregarding
all
others,
i
think
the
federal
government
has
some
obligation
as
grantor
to
see
that
its
grantees
receive
what
the
government
in
fact
gave
them
that
it
may
be
a
moral
and
not
of
legal
obligation.
that
i
think
would
justify
our
views
to
this
court
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
of
course
--
of
course.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
of
course,
but
we
want
to
make
sure
that
they
get
everything
that
at
that
time
they
were
entitled
to
have.
our
second
interest
is
perspective.
we
are
the
owner,
the
united
states
of
considerable
uplands
on
the
pacific
ocean
and
not
as
i
stated
in
my
principal
argument,
some
of
this
land
has
owned
in
trust
for
indians.
eventually,
this
land
will
be
patented
or
allotted
to
these
indians
and
they
will
then
become
the
private
owners.
we
want
to
ensure
now
that
these
indians
will
receive
what
they
presently
have
as
beneficial
owners
when
they
become
the
legal
owners
with
the
right
of
these
accretions
which
the
workings
of
the
pacific
have
demonstrated
will
occur.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
not
at
all.
we
simply
say
that
whoever
owns
the
beach
must
acquire
it
through
legal
proper
means
if
it
is
by
a
public
body
and
the
public
body
should
pay
for
it
under
an
imminent
domain
principle,
if
under
the
law
they
do
not
own
it.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
my
third
point
is
that
the
government
is
making
substantial
park
and
recreation
land
acquisitions
on
the
pacific
coast.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
i
did
mentioned
that
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
said
some
of
that
was
indian
land
where
we
might
have
a
future
problem
that
is
already
dedicated
to
the
governmental
use
which
is
very
important
with
united
states
and
the
present
law.
i
thank
the
court.
and
i
trust
that
i
have
not
added
to
the
confusion
with
this
very
difficult
point.
