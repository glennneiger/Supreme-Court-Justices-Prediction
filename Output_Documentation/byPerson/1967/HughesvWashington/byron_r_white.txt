justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
mr.
weisl
what
the
practice
was
or
what
the
law
--
the
federal
law
was
in
connection
with
the
grant
by
the
united
states
in
a
territory
before
that
territory
became
a
state,
the
grant
of
land
on
a
navigable
stream
by
any
kind
of
the
description
of
what
did
that
federal
patent
carry
with
it
with
respect
to
(a)
accretions,
(b)
title
to
the
streambed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
i
gather
that
a
good
number
of
cases
in
this
court
indicating
a
federal
grant
of
land
located
within
the
state.
are
they
construed
in
accordance
of
the
law
in
the
state
with
respect
to
riparian
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
then
--
this
have
to
distinguish
between
these
cases
and
the
cases
of
accretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
this
including
with
the
part
of
the
case
all
of
these
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
accretion
is
saying
is
really
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
still
going
on
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
vegetation
line
is
really
--
if
you
want
it
to
be
a
permanent
line
that
will
go
wherever
put
it
into
accretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
of
saying
accretion
--
the
rule
of
accretion
is
out
of
the
window.
if
we
do
--
if
we
did
say
that
the
rule
of
accretion
is
not
out
the
window
whether
the
land
that
has
the
--
the
owner
does
have
the
right
of
accretion
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
your
--
it
doesn't
really
matter
the
fact
that
the
actual
vegetation
line
came?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
--
that
you
want
to
have
it
a
permanent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
--
how
can
you
make
that
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
constitution
says
that
once
you
became
a
state,
the
accretion
rights
end.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
united
states
expressly
in
the
deed,
if
this
deed
that
we
have
in
this
case
had
expressed
those,
reported
the
grant
of
accretion,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
you
concede
that
although
the
patent
didn't
say
anything
about
it
nevertheless
the
landowner
had
the
right
to
all
the
accretions
up
to
the
date
that
washington
became
a
state
and
that
is
by
virtue
of
that
his
deed
which
did
not
say
anything
about
accretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
common
law
in
connection
with
this
grant.
is
the
common
law
applied
to
the
grant
--
that
common
law
is
applied
to
that
grant
as
it
would
have
been
the
same
as
though
the
grant
had
said
so
expressly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
say
if
the
law
that
you
were
saying
is
as
bad
it
could
be
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
in
great
britain,
what's
the
rule
of
great
britain
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
united
states
say,
they
think
the
same
argument
today
if
the
grant
is
made
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
this
case,
that
should
turn
on
the
grant
has
been
made
before
what
it
became
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
after.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
united
states
position
with
regard
to
the
accretion
would
be
the
same
today
--
you
were
saying
that
this
grant
had
been
weighed
after
the
statehood?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
say
that
the
pacific
rundown
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
have
--
did
you
say
that
it
might
be
under
the
law
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
involved
overruling
borax
that
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
changing
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
that
that
is
the
consequence
that
if
you
apply
the
common
law
rule
why
the
common
law
does
all
have
land
on
the
pacific
ocean
that
the
state
may
change
the
common
law
why
not
certainly
the
result
that
perhaps
you
might
not
any
longer
own
land
on
the
pacific
ocean.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
common
law
also
gave
riparian
owners
the
access
to
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
state
has
to
pay
compensation
for
cutting
off
access
to
the
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference?
you
just
said
it's
a
different
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
we're
concerned
with
something
more
than
the
area
of
deductions
from
some
by
the
different
rights.
what
difference
really
does
it
make
for
united
states
government
whether
it's
private
grantees
land,
grantees
from
the
19th
century,
what
difference
could
make
united
states
whether
that's
grantee
boundary
is
determined
by
the
state
or
the
federal
law.
why
can't
you
just
leave
it
between
the
citizens
of
the
state
and
let
it
be
the
question
of
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
there
are
some
limits
to
what
you
can
purport
to
give
a
private
grantee
all
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
into
that
direction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
--
i
suppose
if
you
concur
private
ownership
to
reach
the
public
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
had
your
choice.
you
definitely
could
make
a
choice
i
suppose
in
granting
the
patents
to
limit
--
make
it
clear
that
the
limit
of
its
grant,
the
limit
of
its
grant
is
for
example
the
vegetation
line
or
it
means
high
water
as
of
the
certain
day.
you
could
limit
it
that
way
and
then
the
--
and
give
the
rest
of
the
land
of
the
state
i
suppose.
what
was
your
third
point?
you
had
two
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
mr.
weisl
what
the
practice
was
or
what
the
law
--
the

was
in

with

to
(a)
accretions,
(b)
title

streambed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
i
gather
that
a
good
number
of
cases
in
this
court
indicating
a
federal
grant
of
land
located
within
the
state.
are
they
construed
in
accordance
of
the
law
in
the
state
with
respect
to
riparian
right?
justice
byron

white
and
you
do
then

this
have
to
distinguish
between
these
cases
and
the
cases
of
accretion.
justice
byron

with
this
including
with
the

all

you

yes,

it's

going
on
with

the

line
is
really

if
you
want
it
to
be
a
permanent
line
that
will
go
wherever
put
it
into
accretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
of
saying
accretion
--
the
rule
of
accretion
is
out
of
the
window.
if
we
do
--
if
we
did
say
that
the
rule
of
accretion
is
not
out
the
window
whether
the
land
that
has
the

the
owner
does
have
the
right
of

then

justice
byron

white
and
does
your
--
it
doesn't
really
matter
the
fact
that
the
actual
vegetation
line
came?
justice
byron

white
and
it
has
--
that
you
want
to
have
it
a
permanent

justice
byron

white
well,
how
do
you
--
how
can
you
make
that
provision?
justice

your

says
that
once
you
