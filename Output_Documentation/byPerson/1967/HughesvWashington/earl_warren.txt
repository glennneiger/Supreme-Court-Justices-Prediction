of
washington.
mr.
welsh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
welsh,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
line
of
vegetation
as
stated
in
other
precedents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
federal
patent,
the
release
of
federal
patent
is
on
explicit
reference
to
accretion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that's
a
constant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisl.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hartinger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
use
of
the
states
tide
lands
affected
the
erosion
one
way
or
the
other,
would
you
still
say
that
the
accretion
belonged
to
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
it
could
happen
in
any
place
along
that
coast
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
has
happened
along
that
coast
hadn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
have
in
mind
two
cities
in
california
along
the
coast.
one
in
santa
monica
and
the
other
redondo
beach
and
one
the
city
who
with
the
help
of
the
state
put
in
a
breakwater
which
caused
an
accretion,
that's
in
santa
monica
caused
an
accretion
very
similar
and
that
which
we
have
in
this
state
now.
now
the
high
tide
is
almost
quarter
of
a
mile
while
they're
out
to
see
than
it
was
30
years
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
--
then
i
have
in
mind
the
redondo
beach
situation
where
the
city
and
the
state
put
in
breakwater
and
it
tore
away
the
land
and
tore
away
most
of
the
buildings
that
were
facing
on
the
waterfront
before
that.
now,
with
that
change
does
the
state
gain
that
land
as
accreted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hartinger,
may
i
ask
you
if
the
united
states
government
stood
in
the
place
of
stella
hughes
in
this
court
today
on
the
same
facts,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
--
now,
let's
talk
about
the
issues
in
this
case,
you
would
not
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
accretion,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
who
owns
it,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
if
it
belonged
to
the
united
states,
it
could
sell
it,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
everything
that
it
has?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
then
the
united
states
sold
some
of
its
waterfront
property
tomorrow,
it
would
take
up
to
the
present
mean
high
tide
line,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
the
government
we
adopt
the
federal
rule
only
to
say
that
it's
a
mean
high
tide
line.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
let's
put
it
in
practical
term
not
nullifying
anything.
i
will
just
deal
with
the
facts.
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
federal
rule
of
mean
high
tide
applied
then
the
government
could
sell
everything
it
has,
couldn't
it,
to
someone
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
mean
and
anyone
to
whom
it
sold
the
present
time
would
have
--
would
own
up
to
the
mean
high
tide
line,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now
does
that
mean
that
because
mrs.
hughes
has
owned
this
property
since
how
long
back,
i
don't
know,
that
she
would
be
deprived
of
her
land
in
that
area
but
that
some
new
purchaser
who
came
from
the
federal
government
would
be
entitled
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
who
get
--
does
the
state
own
the
tidelands
affirmed
upon
the
grant
owned
by
the
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
do
own
it,
why
wouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
it
just
as
much
is
it
that
was
implied
with
ownership?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
what
principle
did
it
distinguish
that
case
from
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
welsh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
have
some
more
time.
use
some
more
of
your
time

and

it?
chief

earl

well,
i
have
in

two
cities
in
california
along
the
coast.
one
in
santa

and
the

redondo

and
one
the

well,
who

that's
what
i'm
