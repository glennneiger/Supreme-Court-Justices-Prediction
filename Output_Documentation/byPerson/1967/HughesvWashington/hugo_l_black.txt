justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
how
much
actual
land
is
involved
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean?
the
boundary
line
has
became
that
much
--
it
is
recognized
by
accretion
for
500
feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
minimum.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you.
this
seemed
nothing
with
the
accretion
that
goes
all
around
the
united
states
or
is
it
peculiar
to
the
state
of
washington
at
this
time
at
the
atlantic.
do
they
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
problem
of
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
really
wanted
to
have
it
further
but
other
than
that
district
problem
is
peculiar
to
the
state
of
washington,
this
place
is
this
accretion
going
east.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
there
is
not
a
problem
of
accretion
eastward
or
westward
when
you
get
to
the
east
coast.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
why
is
it
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
what
rate
has
this
accretion
change
in
growth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
defendant
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
average
amount
each
year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
any
of
this
accretion
is
settled
on
land
that
is
privately
owned
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
ones
that
the
accretion
was
settled
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
then
i
guess
what
you
say
is
that
the
government
probably
gotten
more
land
out
in
the
open
ocean
than
it
had
have
before
but
it's
gotten
to
the
expense
of
private
owned
lands
right
on
the
coasts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
say
that
some
of
that
accretion
had
settled
on
land
and
owned
by
private
owners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
new
accreted
land
that
comes
to
your
land
by
accretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
provision
the
government
did
not
own
that
before
the
accretion
was
set
alone
therefore
she
can't
own
it
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state
or
private
owner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
federal
government
hace
to
do
with
the
questions
below
on
the
land
of
that
kind?
but
you
say
it
has
nothing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
in
the
statute?
is
there
any
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
conceded
that
the
land
was
owned
by
the
state
before
the
accretion
was
settled
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
how
did
the
federal
government
claim
that
it's
got
no
ownership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
any
of
its
successors
entitled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
this
land
that
could
not
possibly
--
being
500
feet
in
10
miles
a
large
number
of
owners
of
property
about
ten
miles
divided
or
subdivided
under
the
government
claim
of
his
own
land
and
the
land
somehow
i'd
like
to
hear
and
i'd
like
that
he
can
show?
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
--
should
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
--
i
thought
this
is
a
logic
of
reasoning
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
the
government
get
control
of
them
and
they
can
become
a
federal
question?
nearly
because
10
miles
has
been
covered
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
a
problem
isnt?
this
is
500
feet
and
that
they
could
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
understand
you.
but
how
would
if
--
if
that
he
own
this,
how
would
the
federal
government
gain
anything.
justice
