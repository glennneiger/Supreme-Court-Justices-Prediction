mr.
charles
b.
welsh
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
after
many
years
and
many
miles,
we
approach
this
honorable
court
with
depreciation
for
the
permission
granted.
the
problem
submitted
to
you,
we
deem,
to
be
of
basic
simplicity
whether
federal
law
continues
to
govern
the
title
to
imperceptible
accretions
added
to
uplands
acquired
from
the
united
states
government
by
patent.
petitioner,
mrs.
hughes,
is
the
owner
of
a
small
unimproved
track
of
land
of
the
western
coast
of
the
state
of
washington
bordering
the
pacific
ocean.
she,
on
the
other
hand,
represents
in
essence
many
hundreds
of
individual
and
municipal
ownerships
not
only
in
the
state
of
washington
but
in
all
other
similar
situated
owners
and
properties
and
all
public
land
states
of
this
union.
we
submit
that
the
problem
before
you
is
not
academic,
it
is
real,
it
is
substantial.
we're
dealing
with
land
basically
title
to
land.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
in
effect
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
not
as
such,
no.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
no.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
right,
your
honor.
now,
in
a
short
time
ago
in
1966,
these
owners
were
advised
and
informed
by
judicial
fiat
that
the
physical
characteristics
of
their
waterfront
property
had
been
changed.
likewise,
the
theory
of
the
law
under
which
this
land
was
purchased
by
the
government
has
been
changed.
now,
the
theory
of
the
law
of
accretion
antedates
the
commonly
law,
probably
enter
dates
of
the
justinian
code.
it
is
--
it
has
been
the
law
of
nations.
we
complain
bitterly,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
changed
this
law
75
years
after
the
fact
and
hundred
years
after
the
time
of
acquisition.
now,
at
the
time
of
acquisition
at
until
statehood
in
1889,
counsel
freely
admits
that
this
law,
this
theory
bound
the
united
states
as
grantor
and
us
as
grantee.
our
line
were
clearly
established
by
a
judicial
precedent.
our
western
or
seaward
boundary
line
is
the
line
of
being
high
tide
and
that
is
established
by
the
only
known
and
a
certain
method
that's
been
advanced
to
date.
that
is
the
theory
or
the
formula
of
the
united
states
coast
and
geodetic
survey.
now,
to
us,
it
is
not
a
belated
action.
it
is
an
action
grounded
without
precedent.
certainly,
the
counsel
freely
admit
also
that
there
is
no
federal
case
in
any
federal
court
lending
support
to
this
theory
of
the
hughes
case
even
by
inference.
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
case
previous
to
hughes
in
the
state
of
washington
that
lends
any
support
or
credence
to
the
theory
of
the
hughes
case.
the
hughes
case
says
not
now
but
in
1889,
we
took
your
property.
the
property
is
no
longer
bounded
by
an
ambulatory
boundary
line
as
fixed
by
the
natural
movements
of
the
tide
of
the
pacific
ocean.
this
is
fixed
and
immovable
as
of
1889
because
we
say
so.
now
the
formula
that
we
have
it
up
is
this.
it
is
the
line
of
ordinary
high
tide.
now,
the
honorable
justice
weaver,
the
writer
of
the
majority
opinion
in
spencer
a
page
and
a
half
of
defining
this
line
of
ordinary
high
tide.
i
submit
your
honor,
his
definition
follows
no
judicial
precedent
and
is
based
upon
no
scientific
or
no
formula.
this
is
his
own.
there
is
no
engineer
can
lay
out
a
line
based
upon
that
formula
nor
any
lawyers
advise
his
plan
under
this
judicial
formula
where
that
line
will
lie.
the
honorable
justice
equates
this
line
with
the
line
of
vegetation.
the
line
of
vegetation
has
never
been
known
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
be
equated
with
the
line
of
being
high
tide
on
titled
boundaries
where
the
reason
is
natural.
the
reason
is
common
sense.
your
winter
europe,
high
tides,
your
storm
tides
wash
away
any
vegetation
that
is
apparent
and
consistent
on
lakes
for
example,
none
tidal
water
boundary.
now
--
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
the
purpose
of
the
line
of
vegetation,
your
honor,
it
is
unchangeable
and
fairly
accurate.
it
remained
so
in
all
water
boundaries
of
inland
lakes
or
rivers
that
are
unaffected
by
the
tidal
flow.
the
tidal
flow
is
so
vast
that
this
accretion
or
this
vegetation
land
simply
will
not
remain
static.
now,
this
is
a
scientific
truth.
this
is
an
actual,
visual
matter
of
observation
on
these
ocean
beaches.
in
one
tide,
it
will
wash
away
miles
of
that
sort
of
vegetation
to
the
depth
of
several
hundred
feet.
the
vegetation
was
there
the
day
before
it
has
not
existed
today,
therefore
it
becomes
inaccurate.
it
is
not
used.
now,
i
do
not
propose
to
argue
our
position.
i
shall
simply
try
to
explain.
we
bought
to
the
united
states
government
the
deed
ran
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
to
our
areas
it
assigns
forever.
we
understood
in
any
layman,
any
patent
deed
well
understood,
he
was
buying
property
bounded
by
the
pacific
ocean
and
not
subject
to
an
intervening
title
on
upland
subject
to
sale,
lease,
commercial
use
by
some
agency
of
the
state
of
washington.
we
believe
we
can
rely
with
confidence
on
the
wisdom
of
this
court.
we
believe
that
it
will
follow
its
own
precedent
particularly
the
borax
case
and
particularly
this
case
refusal
to
review
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
ninth
circuit,
united
states
versus
washington.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
your
honor,
this
varies
from
probably
a
minimum
of
500
feet
to
three
quarters
of
a
mile
in
depths
between
your
dry,
sandy
beach
land
to
your
vast
hard
sands
uncovered
by
the
flux
and
influx
of
the
tide.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
under
as
a
minimum.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
as
a
minimum
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
it
is
not
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
as
an
attribute
of
its
title.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
pause
in
rebuttal,
first,
justice
douglas
asked
the
question
if
there
is
any
land
in
this
vicinity,
ocean
frontage
that
was
eroding
just
north
of
this
property
in
question.
there
has
been
nearly
five
miles
of
it
erode
and
the
erosion
had
been
nearly
a
quarter,
i
mean
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
depth
as
justice
hill
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
the
state
of
washington
and
the
public
must
swim
out
a
mile
and
a
quarter,
dive
down
to
about
45
meters
in
order
to
enjoy
their
tideland
under
the
hughes
opinion.
now,
counsel
has
mentioned
that
the
state
of
washington
since
1929
has
sold
90%
of
the
water
frontage
in
grays
harbor
county,
the
adjoining
county
to
the
north.
all
of
the
state
deeds
containing
an
ambulatory
boundary
line
stating,
first
to
call
second
class
tidelands.
such
an
appellation
doesn't
exist
either
in
law
or
fact.
there's
no
such
thing.
they
are
uplands
but
the
deed
reached
to
the
line
of
ordinary
high
tide
as
the
same
now
or
hereafter
may
exist.
after
this
property
has
all
been
solved
about
30
miles
of
it,
the
states
run
out
on
erosion
frontage.
the
supreme
court
has
generated
more
in
the
hughes
case
for
the
state
to
sell.
now,
the
counsel
has
said
that
the
hughes
decision
is
not
startling,
i
agree.
to
us
it's
incredible.
as
a
result
of
this
decision,
we
have
five
rules
concerning
water
boundaries
in
the
state
of
washington,
one
concerning
navigable
rivers
and
streams.
this
is
an
ambulatory
boundary
following
the
common
law
concept.
next
is
the
ocean
and
probably
bay
frontage
water
bounded
which
under
the
hughes
case
adopts
a
new
completely
changed
theory.
then
we
have
a
no
man's
land.
these
waters
in
between
the
amounts
of
your
rivers,
your
bays,
your
ocean,
no
one
knows
what
that
law
is
except
that
it's
bound
to
be
under
any
future
decisions
something
different.
then
we
have
another
boundary
line
concept
if
the
present
owner
is
the
united
states
government.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
if
i
follow
counsel's
interpretation
with
hughes
and
fully
admit
that
i
can't
interpret
hughes
logically.
the
state
was
saying
to
the
united
states
government,
you
own
all
of
the
land
that
you
originally
owned
to
the
november
the
11th,
1889.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
this
as
my
understanding
of
the
counsel's
position
or
i
could
be
mistaken.
he
may
have
said
that
government's
line
would
depend
upon
the
line
of
vegetation.
in
any
event
--
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
no,
as
i
think
it's
or
it
would
be
as
of
1889.
i
don't
know
at
least
the
position
of
the
government
as
owner
selling
now
would
be
different
than
the
united
states
government
selling
to
a
private
individual
now.
there
would
be
two
different
concepts.
it
is
then
an
applied
rule
governing
navigable
waters.
now,
i
don't
know
that
any
criticism
would
be
more
just
or
perhaps
cruel
that
justice
harlan
in
his
dissent.
he
said
your
honors
that
there
has
been
a
new
circuitous
and
rather
devious
root
rarely
explored
followed
by
the
majority.
i
think
if
i
will
conclude,
in
our
opinion
justice
hill
is
a
wise
man.
i
thank
you.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles

no.
mr.

no.
mr.

right,

now,
in
a

in

these

were

and
hundred
years
after

of

now,
at
the
time
of
acquisition
at
until
statehood
in
1889,
counsel
freely
admits
that
this
law,
this
theory
bound
the
united
states
as

and
us
as
grantee.
our
line
were
clearly
established
by

our
western

is

being

certainly,
the

freely
admit
also
that
there
is
no

in
any
federal
court
lending
support
to
this
theory
of

in
our

there
is
no

previous
to

in
the

that
lends
any

the

says
not

because
we
say

now
the

that
we

mr.

thank

a
few
pause
in
rebuttal,
first,
justice
douglas
asked
the
question
if
there
is
any
land
in
this
vicinity,
ocean
frontage
that
was
eroding
just
north
of
this

in

there
has
been
nearly
five
miles
of
it
erode
and
the
erosion
had
been
nearly
a
quarter,
i
mean
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
depth
as
justice
hill
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
the
state
of
washington
and
the
public
must
swim
out
a
mile
and
a
quarter,
dive
down
to
about
45
meters
in
order
to
enjoy
their
tideland
under
the
hughes
opinion.
now,
counsel
has
mentioned
that
the
state
of
washington
since
1929
has
sold
90%
of
the
water
frontage
in
grays
harbor
county,
the
adjoining
county
to
the
north.
all
of
the
state
deeds
containing
an
ambulatory
boundary
line
stating,
first
to
call
second
class
tidelands.
such
an
appellation
doesn't
exist
either
in
law
or
fact.
there's
no
such
thing.
they
are
uplands
but
the
deed
reached
to
the
line
of
ordinary
high
tide
as
the
same
now
or
hereafter
may
exist.
after
this
property
has
all
been
solved
about
30
miles
of
it,
the
states
run
out
on
erosion
frontage.
the
supreme
court
has
generated
more
in
the
hughes
case
for
the
state
to
sell.
now,
the
counsel
has
said
that
the
hughes
decision
is
not
startling,
i
agree.
to
us
it's
incredible.
as
a
result
of
this
decision,
we
have
five
rules
concerning
water
boundaries
in
the
state
of
washington,
one
concerning
navigable
rivers
and
streams.
this
is
an
ambulatory
boundary
following
the
common
law
concept.
next
is
the
ocean
and
probably
bay
frontage
water
bounded
which
under
the
hughes
case
adopts
a
new
completely
changed
theory.
then
we
have
a
no
man's
land.
these
waters
in
between
the
amounts
of
your
rivers,
your
bays,
your
ocean,
no
one
knows
what
that
law
is
except
that
it's
bound
to
be
under
any
future
decisions
something
different.
then
we
have
another
boundary
line
concept
if
the
present
owner
is
the
united
states
government.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
if
i
follow
counsel's
interpretation
with
hughes
and
fully
admit
that
i
can't
interpret
hughes
logically.
the
state
was
saying
to
the
united
states
government,
you
own
all
of
the
land
that
you
originally
owned
to
the
november
the
11th,
1889.
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
this
as
my
understanding
of
the
counsel's
position
or
i
could
be
mistaken.
he
may
have
said
that
government's
line
would
depend
upon
the
line
of
vegetation.
in
any
event
--
mr.
charles
b.
welsh
no,
as
i
think
it's
or
it
would
be
as
of
1889.
i
don't
know
at
least
the
position
of
the
government
as
owner
selling
now
would
be
different
than
the
united
states
government
selling
to
a
private
individual
now.
there
would
be
two
different
concepts.
it
is
then
an
applied
rule
governing
navigable
waters.
now,
i
don't
know
that
any
criticism
would
be
more
just
or
perhaps
cruel
that
justice
harlan
in
his
dissent.
he
said
your
honors
that
there
has
been
a
new
circuitous
and
rather
devious
root
rarely
explored
followed
by
the
majority.
i
think
if
i
will
conclude,
in
our
opinion
justice
hill
is
a
wise
man.
i
thank
you.
