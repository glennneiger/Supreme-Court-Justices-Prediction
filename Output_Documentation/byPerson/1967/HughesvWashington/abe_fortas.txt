justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
if
we
should
decide
that
federal
law
controls
--
we
could
nevertheless
accept
the
vegetation
line
for
purposes
of
demarcation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
at
first
you
take
the
position
of
federal
law
that
should
not
control
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
if
this
had
always
been
--
let's
just
assume
somehow
rather
that
this
would
always
been
private
land
and
that
date
when
they
had
in
here
an
issue
instead
of
a
federal
patent
issuing,
there
had
been
a
transfer
to
another
individual,
now
from
that
date
to
the
date
when
the
stated
doctrine
it's
conflicting
land
policy
by
virtue
of
the
common
law,
the
new
owner
would
have
done
it
prior
to
accretions,
it
would
have
been
entitled
to
acquisition
is
that
right?mr.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
the
state
could
come
in
and
then
say
that
as
of
18
--
what
was
it,
‘89?
justice
abe
fortas
as
of
1889,
the
accretion
will
no
longer
go
to
the
private
owner
but
will
go
to
the
state,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
once
a
federal
government
issued
the
patent
and
divested
itself
here
saying
of
all
of
its
interest
then
the
land
for
all
purposes
including
this
purpose
should
be
treated
as
private
land,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
purposes
of
this
problem
anyway,
you're
saying
that
the
land
once
the
federal
government
issued
its
patent
the
land
ought
to
be
treated
like
any
other
private
land.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
may
try
to
put
it
in
another
way
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
force
of
the
patent
was
exhausted
and
there
was
issue,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
state
of
oregon
dealt
with
this
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
just
along
navigable
lakes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
any
--
is
alaska
have
any
law
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
and
one
of
the
vegetation
that
would
contend
for
is
an
ambulatory
line,
is
that
right?
so
it
depend
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
this
clear
in
my
own
mind.
if
the
federal
government
following
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
federal
government
still
own
this
land,
you
would
not
claim
that
the
service
state
claim
to
the
accretions
against
the
federal
government?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
say
that
the
demarcation
line
is
not
mean
high
tide
which
the
federal
rule
i
take
it,
generally
regardless
to
this
federal
rule
but
that
the
line
of
demarcation
is
the
line
of
vegetation
as
it
exists
at
the
time
the
state
may
--
at
the
termination.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
federal
government
today
saw
some
land
which
he
has
owned
today,
i
suppose
the
logic
of
your
position
would
require
to
think
about.
but
i
suppose
the
logic
of
your
position
was
referring
to
say
that
the
purchaser
acquires
that
land
with
the
seaward
boundary
defined
by
federal
law
as
of
today.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
your
argument
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
don't
say
you
square
that
with
the
position
you've
been
taking
in
your
discussion
with
the
chief
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
--
that's
precisely
the
difficulty
of
it
which
what
it
was
trying
is
that
the
federal
law
is
between
sort
of
functus
officio
because
as
soon
as
the
state
adopted
it
its
law
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
the
federal
law
will
have
vitality
so
long
as
against
--
the
federal
law
have
vitalities
so
long
as
the
federal
government
own
the
land
but
only
if
the
federal,
only
as
of
the
date
when
the
state
adopted
its
law.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
saying
aren't
you
that
it
doesn't
--
it
is
of
no
significance
here
that
this
title
was
acquired
by
a
federal
patent,
that
it
end
that
federal
patent
has
been
--
the
legal
consequences
would
be
the
same
that
is
if
the
rule
as
of
the
time
the
predecessors
in
title
acquired
this
land.
if
the
rule
at
that
time
was
that
the
accretion
belonged
to
the
uplands
up
to
this
line
and
then
you'd
say
that
the
state
can
never
take
that
away
and
it's
not
a
correction
of
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
law,
is
that
your
position
now?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
common
law
of
accretions
is
nothing
more
than
--
it
is
nothing
less
rather
i'm
going
to
say
than
the
statement
of
that
i'm
outwitting
essential
constitutional
principle?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
told
us
of
the
cases
coming
but
even
so,
what
is
the
logic
of
your
position
as
applied
to
the
court
from
the
compensations?
suppose
the
state
owns
a
breakwater
and
the
result
of
it
is
to
inundate
some
of
the
upland
land
to
this
tideland.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
state
suppose
it
takes
away
some
of
this
accretion
to
fill
in
the
land
that's
previously
accreted,
thus
the
state
takes
compensation?
is
that
the
logic
of
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
taking
the
position
--
you're
taking
the
position
that
the
land
that
has
accreted
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
protected
by
the
constitution
it
belongs
to
the
land
to
the
upland
landowner.
now,
the
state
deliberately
in
knowing
what's
going
to
happen
builds
a
breakwater
and
so
that
land
by
reason
of
the
state's
act
is
taken
away.
is
there
a
state
that
have
a
servitude
or
how
do
you
reconcile
the
position
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
pay
compensation,
maybe
you
don't,
maybe
you
said
does
it
concede.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
i
think
i
understand
that
doctrine
but
i
don't
understand
how
to
describe
it
with
your
position
on
accretions.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
too
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
find
this
kind
of
statement
in
the
constitutional
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
if
we
should
decide
that
federal
law
controls
--
we
could
nevertheless
accept
the
vegetation
line
for

of
