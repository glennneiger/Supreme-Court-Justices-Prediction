mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that's
before
the
court
today
is
unusually
complicated
by
the
fact
that
it's
hard
to
communicate
in
understanding
of
the
problem
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
attempting
to
solve.
what
we
have
in
the
state
of
washington
is
a
westerly
boundary
line
which
borders
on
the
pacific
ocean.
now,
the
state
of
washington
neighbor
to
the
south
is
the
state
of
oregon,
the
columbia
river
divides
oregon
from
washington.
then
from
the
columbia
river
north,
we
have
a
long
sliver,
a
long
piece
of
land
which
runs
almost
directly
north
called
the
long
beach
peninsula
and
it's
separated
from
the
mainland
via
bay,
willapa
bay.
then
you
proceed
north
to
another
stretch
of
ocean
beach
until
you
come
to
grays
harbor
which
is
another
inlet
and
then
the
beach
continues
north
until
the
straits
of
juan
de
fuca.
now
the
strait
is
the
entrance
to
the
great
puget
sound
and
hood
canal,
the
large
and
internal
waterway
of
the
state
of
washington.
now,
the
area
we're
talking
about
is
that
area
of
the
state
which
borders
the
pacific
ocean
and
the
reason
we're
talking
about
it
is
that
from
the
columbia
river
to
the
tip
of
the
long
beach
peninsula
and
then
that
little
beach
between
willapa
bay
and
grays
harbor
and
then
a
portion
of
the
beach
north
along
the
olympic
peninsula
has
been
building
up
by
a
slow
imperceptible
accretion.
alluvium
has
been
deposited
along
the
shore.
what
--
well,
i
suppose
the
boundary
no
longer
is
the
boundary.
the
boundary
is
moving
to
the
west.
it's
moving
seaward.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
your
honor
knows
the
northern
part
of
the
coast
is
the
olympic
peninsula
and
the
coastal
area
is
part
of
the
olympic
national
park.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
in
this
area
where
the
olympic
national
park
is
concerned,
the
accretion
problem
does
not
exist.
the
accretion
then
commence
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
oh!
no.
i
--
in
the
area
adjacent
to
the
olympic
peninsula,
the
boundary
has
remained
constant
so
far
as
i
know.
inside
some
of
the
bays
as
for
instance
inside
port
willapa
in
an
area
that
we're
not
concerned
with
there
has
been
eroded.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
wouldn't
as
i
will
explain
the
state
law,
it
calls
for
a
fixing
of
a
permanent
line
so
that
the
state
either
loses
when
there
is
accretion
moving
the
line
westerly
nor
gains
when
there
is
an
erosion
moving
a
line
easterly.
now,
i
--
now
the
reason
that
this
case
is
so
important
to
the
state
is
that
this
is
the
ocean
beach
for
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
the
ocean
recreational
area
for
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
the
part
of
the
state
where
the
people
have
always
used
the
ocean
and
since
1901,
the
beach
has
been
formally
dedicated
to
the
public.
now,
i
have
on
the
board
a
large
diagram.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
it
is
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
this
will
be
one
of
the
problems
that
the
court
will
want
to
--
can
turn
itself
with.
now,
we're
going
to
be
talking
about
state
law
and
then
the
question
is,
is
there
some
federal
reason,
is
there
some
federal
ground
whereby
this
court
without
a
statute
directing
it
to
do
it
without
a
constitutional
provision
compelling
it
to
do
it.
whether
this
court
is
going
to
step
in
and
change
the
state
law.
now,
if
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
probably
for
such
extensive
areas,
it
might
be
unique
but
i'm
sure
that
there
is
the
problem
of
accretion.
but
if
there
were
a
problem
of
accretion
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well
of
course,
if
it
would
be
the
same
principle
that
we
have
here,
the
land
would
be
building
out
to
sea,
it
would
be
building
east
on
the
atlantic
whereas
it
builds
west
on
the
pacific
where
we
are.
but
as
we
will
find
out,
no
one
contends
that
this
court
would
have
any
concern
at
all
with
that
eastern
boundary
and
this
will
be
part
of
our
problem
to
explain
to
the
court.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
position
that's
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
supported
by
the
solicitor
general
is
that
the
rule
that
they're
asking
this
court
to
intervene
solely
on
the
ground
that
washington
is
a
public
land
state
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
property
we're
talking
about
here
today
was
owned
by
the
government
until
1866
but
not
since.
the
government
is
private
with
all
title
to
this
property
in
1866.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
--
if
perhaps
could
be
common
with
alaska
or
oregon.
it
will
not
--
the
government's
or
the
solicitor's
position
and
petitioner's
position
would
not
affect
california.
it
would
not
affect
texas.
it
will
not
affect
the
gulf
states.
it
will
just
be
the
states
that
i
mentioned.
now
i
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
this
is
not
the
fact
but
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
not
to
the
consequence
of
the
state.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
suspect
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yeah,
under
washington
law
which
may
not
be
a
general
law.
under
washington
state
law,
if
obstructions
are
placed
in
a
navigable
stream
so
as
to
carry
away
a
bank
that
constitutes
an
unconstitutional
damage
in
taking
the
property.
it's
a
--
if
this
is
washington
state
law
under
the
washington
state
constitution
so
then
if
the
state
would
build
a
bulk
head
to
divert
the
stream
and
to
carry
away
land
that
would
--
the
state
would
have
to
pay
for
it.
now,
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case
and
i
can
best
illustrate
the
two
issues
with
the
large
diagram
which
is
on
the
board
and
i
want
to
digress
for
a
moment,
the
large
diagram
is
a
picture.
it's
--
it's
not
drawn
to
scale.
i'm
using
it
simply
because
the
exhibit
that
is
before
the
court
is
down
below
there
and
it's
not
large
enough
for
me
to
see
it
and
i'm
sure
the
court
can't
read
it.
now,
mr.
miller
is
with
me
here,
mr.
miller
point
to
--
on
a
large
diagram
a
line
which
represents
in
the
underlined.
now,
what
we're
dealing
with
is
property
which
would
be
to
the
right
or
the
east
of
the
underlined
as
originally
surveyed
by
the
surveyor
general
for
the
united
states,
well,
those
lands
were
public
lands.
from
that
point
to
the
west,
mr.
miller
--
the
next
line
that's
marked
on
there
represents
a
point
to
which
the
build
up
of
the
land
had
proceeded
from
the
time
of
original
meandering
to
the
date
of
washington
statehood
which
was
1889.
from
that
line
then,
we
move
to
the
next
line
where
we
still
represent
an
area
of
build
up
by
accretion.
the
area
between
the
last
two
lines
represents
the
build
up
that
took
place
during
statehood
or
after
1889.
then
from
the
point
mr.
miller
is
pointing
to
now,
we
can
go
west
to
the
--
to
a
line
which
represents
the
line
of
mean
high
tide,
calculated
according
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
and
then
of
course
westerly
of
that
line
is
simply
a
beach.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
a
title
dispute
and
it
concerns
the
lands
which
were
formed
by
accretion
since
statehood
that
is
the
area
that's
been
pointed
out
now.
we
also
have
a
dispute
over
the
top
portion
of
the
beach
proper,
the
area
between
the
line
there
and
the
line
up
above.
the
line
on
the
left
again
is
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
mean
high
tide.
the
line
on
the
right
is
the
line
of
vegetation.
now
these
two
lines
are
different.
greatly,
when
we
talk
about
the
vegetation
line
which
is
the
top
line,
which
is
the
line
which
marks
the
limits
of
tide
lands
according
to
washington
law.
we're
talking
about
a
line
which
the
water
impresses
upon
the
soil
by
covering
it
for
sufficient
periods
of
time
to
destroy
vegetation
and
to
make
the
lands
value
this
for
agriculture.
this
definition
is
the
same
definition
which
the
state
of
washington
uses
to
locate
water
boundaries
of
lakes,
and
rivers
of
streams,
it's
the
same
definition
which
the
united
states
uses
when
it
measures
the
extent
of
its
navigational
servitude.
it's
a
commonly
understood
concept.
it's
a
commonly
applied
concept
and
that
marks
the
limits
of
tidelands
according
to
washington
law.
the
second
line,
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
line
is
a
mathematical
computation
on
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
we
have
tides
--
high
tides
twice
daily.
i
understand
that
this
is
the
situation
similar
phenomenon
on
the
atlantic
side
of
the
united
states
whereas
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
there
is
but
one
high
tide
and
low
tide
per
day
according
to
the
classifications
of
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic.
now,
twice
a
day
then
the
tides
flow
from
the
left
to
the
right
up
the
beach.
one
of
these
tides
is
higher
than
the
other
tide.
so
we
have
one
higher
high
tide,
one
lower
high
tide.
and
these
high
tides
then
that
we
have
actually
flowing
on
the
beach
are
converted
to
mathematical
calculations
by
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
which
eliminates
any
action
on
the
water
by
spacious,
by
winds,
by
storms,
by
run
on
the
beach,
it
reduces
tide
level
to
a
mathematical
representation
of
the
forces
which
the
sun
and
the
moon
exert
upon
the
water.
it's
a
theoretical
concept
so
then
this
is
what
professor
corker
calls
the
waveless
ocean
from
which
they
start
to
work
their
formula.
now,
then
they
take
the
--
they
take
the
changes
in
the
tides,
their
formulas
and
spread
them
over
a
year,
a
period
of
19
years
and
then
they
calculate
an
average
so
they
will
have
these
averages.
they
will
have
mean
higher
high
tide
with
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
no.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
difference
between
--
the
difference
between
mean
high
tide
and
the
line
of
vegetation
is
the
major
difference
between
us.
the
area
of
the
beach
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
accretion
matter
is
a
major
issue
but
it
involves
a
175
feet
of
--
above
the
beach.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is
and
if
we
don't,
we
do
not
wait.
but
if
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
i
--
the
vegetation
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
your
honor
is
that
--
your
honor
is
right.
the
--
if
we're
sustained
on
accretion
then
the
matters
that
we're
talking
about
now
are
taken
into
consideration
only
when
we
determine
that
1889
dividing
line.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
when
we
talk
about
the
beach
proper,
when
we
talk
about
the
vegetation
line,
we
talk
about
a
line
that
changes
as
the
reach
of
the
water
changes
because
it's
a
line
which
the
water
establishes.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
--
on
this
property
here,
the
growth
of
the
beach
has
been
175
feet.
the
case
before
the
court,
it
has
been
175
feet.
there
are
cases
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
the
growth
rate
has
been
constant.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
since
1889
which
is
the
date
of
washington
statehood.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
patent
was
in
1866.
the
meander
line
was
established
in
my
recollection
is
approximately
1858
between
the
meander
line
and
the
1889
line.
now
this
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
there
is
approximately
350
feet
of
accretion
prior
to
statehood.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
at
this
particular
respondent,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
precisely
the
position
we
take.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
take
the
position
that
number
one,
wash
on
--
first
of
all,
we
should
divide
this
between
the
accretion
problem
and
the
beach
problem.
both
questions
i
must
necessarily
accreted
both
of
them
but
in
argument
i
must
divide
them
to
make
my
position
understandable.
on
the
accretion
problem,
we
recognize
that
the
common
law
prior
to
washington
became
a
state,
then
our
constitution
destroyed
riparian
rights,
all
of
them.
the
right
of
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
this
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
your
honor,
the
explanation
is
this.
we
assert
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
change
the
common
law
as
it
affects
privately
owned
lands
but
our
washington
supreme
court
denies
that
washington
law
has
the
power
to
change
the
common
law
as
it
pertains
to
the
lands
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
have
a
constitutional
problem
then
which
would
be
another
problem.
the
ownership
of
the
beach,
the
ownership
of
the
tidelands
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
property
it
acquired
at
the
time
it
became
a
state
was
a
property
it
acquired
as
an
incident
of
its
sovereignty,
it
was
not
by
granting
the
federal
government.
under
pollard
versus
hagan
we
learned
that
ownership
of
tidelands
goes
with
sovereignty
and
the
sovereignty
it
goes
with
is
state
sovereignty
just
as
we
learned
in
united
states
versus
california
that
the
ownership
of
offshore
lands
is
an
incident
of
sovereignty
but
in
that
case,
it's
an
incident
of
national
or
federal
sovereignty.
and
then
the
question
would
be
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
constitutional
doctrine
whether
the
united
states
which
is
borrowed
by
the
equal
footing
doctrine
from
subtracting
from
the
state,
that
sovereignty
which
other
--
the
original
13
states
had
whether
--
because
the
original
13
states
would
have
the
right
to
change
the
common
law
whether
the
federal
government
could
have
denied
the
state
that
right.
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
answer
the
question
but
that
is
not
the
problem
here
because
the
patent
does
not
say
anything
about
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
your
honor.
it
was
by
virtue
of
the
common
law
which
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
not
a
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
common
law
control
--
the
right
to
accretion
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
joy
versus
st.
louis,
a
case
which
must
be
read
and
must
be
understood
on
the
question
of
accretion,
joy
versus
st.
louis
in
volume
203
of
united
states
reports.
the
court
explicitly
said
that
the
right
to
accretion
under
the
patent
given
by
the
government
was
riparian
right.
the
court
specifically
said
that
an
issue
over
that
accretion
was
not
a
federal
question
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
1889.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
there
--
we
do
concede
that
there
are
limits
beyond
which
the
state
cannot
go
but
we
are
not
exceeding
them
here.
now
the
right
of
this
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
or
put
it
better
yet,
once
the
federal
government
gave
its
patent.
the
land
ought
to
be
treated
the
same
as
if
that
patent
had
been
given
by
great
britain
or
spain,
by
mexico
or
by
the
state
subject
to
general
law.
now,
the
power
of
a
state
to
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
under
common
law
until
it's
changed,
the
riparian
owner
will
get
the
accretion
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
so
far
as
the
federal
question
is
concerned,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that
would
have
been
the
rule
but
nobody
would
challenge
the
state
law
if
we
had
a
grant
from
great
britain.
the
arguments
made
that
this
court
should
intervene.
in
this
case
for
the
simple
and
sole
and
the
only
reason
that
the
patent
was
given
by
the
government
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
we
think
that
it
makes
no
sufficient
case
for
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
--
no,
it
does
not
accept
that
if
it's
made
after
statehood,
of
course
the
accretions
that
have
formed
after
the
date
of
patent
would
go
to
the
patent
deed.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
because
i'm
speaking
about
after
statehood,
your
honor.
prior
to
statehood,
the
accretions
that
had
formed
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
would.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
now,
i
want
to
have
mr.
miller
point
out
at
present
time
the
beach.
in
1901,
this
beach
was
dedicated
to
the
public
and
we've
illustrated
the
area
that
the
public
had
their
rights
in
up
to
the
top
of
the
beach
and
administratively
it
was
construed
that
this
beach
included
that
a
175
feet
of
accretion,
that
portion
there,
our
supreme
court
leaves
us
in
doubt.
the
legislature
after
the
decision
of
the
court
then
comes
in
and
speaks
unmistakably,
we
gave
a
seashore
conservation
area
which
extends
from
extreme
low
tides
or
else
we
can
get
up
to
the
vegetation
line
and
that
is
a
public
beach
now.
the
accretion
between
the
public
deeds
is
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
seashore
conservation
area
access
and
other
things
that
can
be
used
in
connection
with
the
beach.
now,
when
we
talk
--
the
question
about
changing
the
common
law
doctrine
of
accretion,
now
that
question
has
been
before
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
construing
a
california
statute.
the
california
statute
was
subsequently
reinterpreted
by
the
california
court
in
a
different
way
than
the
court
of
appeals
had
it
interpreted
it.
but
nonetheless,
the
western
pacific
case,
western
pacific
railroad
versus
southern
pacific
company
is
the
california
case
which
delves
into
the
problem
and
justifies
the
state's
power
to
change
accretion
if
for
instance
you
have
a
sloping
beach
and
the
state
fills
along
the
top
of
the
beach
disregarding
the
accretion
problem.
but
if
our
--
yes,
if
the
state
builds
across
the
top
of
the
beach,
that
fixes
the
line.
the
state
can
do
any
number
of
things,
it
could
put
those
bulkheads
which
would
cause
the
beach
to
build
up
and
this
would
fix
the
property
line
and
all
we're
doing
here
is
accomplishing
the
same
thing
by
a
law
rather
than
sending
a
man
out
that
would
pick
and
shovel
to
pick
the
dirt
up
to
fix
the
line,
you
do
it
by
law.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
the
area
that
we
are
primarily
interested
in,
the
adjacent
lands
are
almost
entirely
privately
own.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yeah,
in
front
of
those.
yes.
we
--
the
tide
lands
that
built
up
so
that
once
lands
which
were
tidelands
are
raised
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
by
the
deposit
of
alluvium
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
we
do
not
take
land
at
the
expense
of
the
private
owners.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
it
settles
on
the
tide
lands.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
always
settles
on
tidelands
and
builds
the
tidelands
up
so
that
the
tidelands
are
raised
above
the
level
of
the
ocean.
it
does
not
deprive
the
private
owner
of
any
property.
what
the
private
owner
insists
on
in
this
case
is
a
rule
of
law
which
will
let
in
acquired
title
to
the
lands
which
once
were
tidelands.
lands
which
concededly
once
were
state
owned.
he
wants
to
acquire
tideland
property.
he
wants
to
acquire
it
or
he
wants
to
acquire
it
when
the
alluvium
deposit
raises
the
level
of
the
tideland
above
the
level
of
the
ocean.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
state
taking
property
away.
it's
a
question
of
the
property
owner
enhancing
its
ownership
by
extending
it.
now,
we
believe
that
this
common
law
doctrine
by
which
the
property
owner
could
do
that
can
be
modified
by
the
state
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
modifies
the
common
law
owner's
right
to
take
water
from
a
stream,
this
riparian
right
to
take
water.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
most
definitely
did
own
it
before
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
the
state
not
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
owned
the
land
before
the
accretion
settled
on.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
private
owner
seeks
a
principle
of
law
which
lets
him
extend
his
ownership,
widen
his
ownership.
that's
the
case
that
we
have.
now,
the
interesting
thing
that
we
speak
about
accretion
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
any
right
to
pass
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no
statute.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
review
the
wisdom
of
a
state
law.
i
think
that
it's
foreclosed
and
i
think
that
there's
a
federal
interest
which
lets
this
court
step
into
this
area.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
federal
government
has
had
no
ownership
that's
affected
by
this
case
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
this
--
the
government's
successors
acquired
their
title
in
1866
and
under
a
principle
of
law
that
applied
until
the
state
of
washington
changed
it,
they
were
able
to
extend
their
ownership
westward.
then
the
state
of
washington
change
this
ownership
--
change
this
rule
of
law
and
said
that
henceforth,
the
titled
state
is
right
where
it
was,
the
boundary
will
not
move.
now,
on
both
of
the
issues
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
this
point,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
state's
position
and
the
state's
right
to
do
what
the
state
of
washington
has
done
is
not
a
startling
proposition.
when
for
instance
the
line
of
vegetation
versus
the
mean
high
tide
line,
the
state
of
washington
is
doing
nothing
more
than
develop
the
common
law
and
they're
developing
it
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
san
francisco
versus
le
roy
which
was
decided
about
the
time
washington
became
a
state.
san
francisco
versus
le
roy,
the
vegetation
line
rule
is
still
the
rule
which
the
secretary
of
interior
instructs
his
own
employees
to
follow
and
section
520
of
the
manual
of
instructions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
manuals
speaks
of
the
problem
of
accretion
and
the
bureau
of
land
management
is
instructed
to
serve
an
accretion
in
front
of
the
public
domain
only
if
that
accretion
would
be
privately
owned
if
it
were
in
front
of
private
uplands.
in
other
words,
the
recognition
is
found
by
the
national
government's
land
administrator
of
the
possibility
of
the
state
rules
of
the
kind
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
to
both
questions.
this
would
be
to
find
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
this
court
--
i
think
that
the
accretion
language
has
been
directed
primarily
to
rivers,
however,
we
follow
the
moving
boundary
on
rivers
in
washington.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
includes
the
pacific
ocean
because
these
instructions
primarily
relate
to
the
--
they
relate
to
the
public
domain
which
is
the
western
state
primarily.
now,
the
situation
that
we've
got
here
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
washington
law
recognizes
moving
boundaries
on
rivers.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
by
a
reason
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
have
no
man's
land.
we
have
--
we
know
what
the
law
is
on
rivers
and
streams.
we
know
what
the
law
is
on
the
ocean.
it's
a
matter
of
dispute
frankly
as
to
how
this
law
will
be
applied
to
the
anterior
waterways.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
it's
by
accident.
when
we
deal
with
--
when
we
deal
with
property
law,
we're
very
much
concerned
with
the
certainty
and
definiteness
and
we
want
to
know
what's
happened
before.
for
instance,
in
this
area
of
the
public
beach
on
that
long
beach
peninsula
that
i
was
telling
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
what
the
washington
supreme
court
said
in
a
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it's
not
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it's
not
logical,
your
honor,
but
that
is
the
washington
law
and
we
cannot
--
we
must
accept
it
and
the
court
--
the
court
i
think
will
adhere
to
this
prior
river
case
and
go
forth
and
recognize
the
accreted
title
because
of
the
rules
of
property.
just
as
in
the
cases
that
we
have
here
in
the
vicinity
of
this
lawsuit,
there
have
been
a
series
of
73
cases
affecting
over
3
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
definitely.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
the
same
rule.
but
rules
of
property
are
very
important
and
it's
important
that
they'd
be
conducted
and
formulated
at
a
local
level.
professor
corker
who
is
cited
by
--
we
all
cite
him.
professor
corker
is
very
upset
with
the
washington
supreme
court
in
what
it
did.
but
the
way
he
puts
it
is
this,
he
said,
if
they're
wrong,
they
have
the
right
to
be
wrong.
now,
i
don't
agree
with
him
about
his
judgment
of
washington
law
but
i
do
agree
with
him
about
the
fact
that
it's
a
state
matter
and
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
of
oregon
so
far
as
i
know
has
no
appellate
decisions.
but
the
state
of
oregon
has
a
statute
which
has
deprived
the
upland
owners
of
a
title
to
accretion
or
reliction
formed
after
1917
along
navigable
lakes.
we
have
cited
the
statute.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
just
along
navigable
lakes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
alaska
has
no
law.
i
would
--
no,
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
report
either
in
their
statutes
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that
--
there
was
a
suggestion
that
at
the
time
of
the
government's
patent,
there
may
have
been
so
much
land
between
the
meander
line
and
the
ocean
that
the
government's
patent
would
not
appear
a
title
to
the
ocean
but
that
was
merely
a
suggestion
offered
by
the
solicitor
in
order
to
round
out
the
body
of
the
law
and
that
is
not
a
problem
in
this
case
as
i
understand
the
solicitor's
prefound
the
merits.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
it's
very
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
theory
would
be
that
when
the
government
gave
its
patent
it
expected
the
land
that
it
would
convey
to
be
approximately
the
acreage
shown
in
the
government
survey.
if
that
meander
line
was
grossly
out
of
place,
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
it
could
not
have
intended
to
give
10
miles
of
land.
they
simply
intended
to
give
the
acreage
on
the
survey
and
they
cite
a
decision
of
the
interior
department
and
i
believe
there
is
a
judicial
authority
which
would
support
them
but
that
is
not
a
problem
in
our
particular
case.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
the
--
we're
talking
here
about
something
that
it's
all
together
different.
we're
talking
about
beach
in
front
of
the
property.
we're
not
--
we
don't
have
the
problem
where
the
government,
the
national
government
or
the
federal
government
has
any
claim.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
they
would
not
--
they
would
not
except
under
that
one
distinction,
that
one
convincing
problem
that
i
just
spoke
to.
the
federal
government
has
no
interest
in
any
of
this
land
that
we're
talking
about
today
and
it
owns
very
little
land
in
the
southern
part
of
the
ocean
beach,
the
southerly
part
where
the
bulk
of
the
accretions
have
gone.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i'd
be
here
on
the
ocean
beach
issue.
i
would
not
be
here
on
the
accretion
issue.
i'd
be
here
on
the
definition
of
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
the
accretion
issue.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
would
be
here
on
the
disagreement
for
the
top
part
of
the
beach
because
we
can
turn
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
contend
that
the
state
owned
it
and
we
would
contend
that
that
boundary
line
again
is
located
by
a
legal
rule
or
a
common
law
rule.
we
adopted
our
rule
which
was
this
court's
rule.
we
adopted
this
court's
rule
at
about
the
time
of
statehood
and
what
we
say
is
that
since
it's
a
reasonable
and
more
rational
and
more
logical
extension
or
development,
if
you
will,
of
the
common
law
that
this
court
ought
to
accept
it
that
this
court
ought
not
to
attempt
to
follow
a
rule
like
the
borax
rule
theoretical
rule
which
fixes
through
a
mathematical
formula
which
fixes
a
boundary
in
this
case,
386
feet
below
the
bottom
of
the
beach
as
one
attorney
remarked
to
me,
it's
not
the
wisdom
of
solomon
to
cut
the
beach
in
half.
we
think
that
the
state
has
the
freedom
to
develop
the
common
law
concept
of
what's
the
ordinary
limit
of
the
tidelands
which
the
state
would
own
irrespective
of
the
accretion
issue.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
don't
think
it
does
but
professor
corker
in
this
article
disagrees
with
me
and
i
have
stated
in
the
brief
for
that
reason,
i
have
stated
that
if
it
does,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
say
that
the
state
of
washington
can
adopt
any
rule
it
wishes.
it
can
adopt
the
borax
rule,
it
can
adopt
the
vegetation
line
rule,
it
could
adopt
the
californian
mean
high
tide
line
rule
and
--
but
the
borax
case
and
how
i
have
construed
it.
in
borax,
the
problem
of
the
argument
was
different
in
borax,
dealing
without
a
record,
dealing
on
the
basis
of
the
assumptions
of
counsel,
the
purpose
of
the
impression
that
the
line
of
vegetation,
that
the
line
that
we're
seeking
here
was
below
the
line
of
mean
high
tide.
now,
the
normal
way
to
resolve
an
issue
such
as
that
would
have
been
for
this
court
to
say
that
if
that's
the
case,
it's
no
concern
of
ours
but
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
the
rule
that
was
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
applied
as
a
federal
rule
and
on
its
face,
the
case
simply
says
hat
a
state
may
not
disclaim
interest
in
land
below
the
mean
high
tide
line.
that's
what
it
said
on
its
face
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
united
states
your
honor,
we
would
have
a
changing
line,
an
ambulatory
line.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
united
states
could
sell
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it
could
sell
it,
yes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
say
vegetation
line,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
this
court
nullifies
the
state
law
then
this
court
will
have
to
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
could.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it
could.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
new
purchaser
would
own
more
land
than
mrs.
hughes
because
they
--
well,
the
government
is
owner
--
the
accretion
rule
can't
be
changed
by
the
state
and
therefore
the
government
acquires
state
land
to
the
doctrine
of
accretion
whereas
mrs.
hughes
who
is
subject
to
state
law
does
not
acquire
it.
one
would
have
a
boundary
that
would
be
seaward
to
the
other.
when
the
government
if
today
made
a
conveyance,
its
patentee
would
take
the
same
land
that
the
government
had
but
of
course
the
government's
patentee
would
take
subject
to
the
right
of
the
state
change
the
law
and
of
course
state
law
does
become
operative
at
that
point
and
the
owner
who
took
today
would
not
then
be
able
to
extend
his
ownership
through
accretion
in
the
future
but
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor
and
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
argue
that
question
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
against
us
and
that
is
the
case
that's
cited
to
the
court
as
washington
versus
united
states.
because
of
that
case,
the
washington
supreme
court
gave
--
the
washington
supreme
court
said
that
that
case
binds
them.
they
construe
that
case
as
announcing
a
federal
law,
announcing
federal
law
that
the
state
couldn't
change
the
rule
of
accretion
and
the
washington
supreme
court
then
acknowledged
this
federal
case,
this
ninth
circuit
case.
that's
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
the
basis
that
--
well,
the
federal
government
is
the
owner
of
the
property.
the
state
is
powerless
to
change
the
law
which
affects
the
federal
ownership.
under
the
federal
constitution
the
congress
has
the
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
concerning
the
public
domain,
the
congress
and
not
the
state.
so
this
is
the
distinction.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
federal
law
which
incorporate
state
law
as
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
most
definitely,
we
can
square
that.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
inconsistent,
no.
the
--
you
have
a
problem
of
putting
a
line
between
the
federal
ownership
and
the
state
ownership.
we're
assuming
that
the
federal
owner
today
and
the
state
tideland
owner
today
have
to
have
a
boundary
between
them.
what
we
insist
is
that
since
we
all
agreed
that
this
is
a
common
law
concept,
the
federal
law
should
follow
the
state
law
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
one
case,
we're
talking
about
a
change
in
law
applicable
to
the
federal
government.
in
the
other
case,
we're
talking
about
the
development
of
real
property
law.
it's
not
a
change
of
law.
we
have
a
state
rule
which
is
founded
directly
on
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
that
was
decided
in
about
1890,
very
close
to
statehood
and
we
followed
that
rule
and
we
are
simply
asking
that
this
court
not
force
us
to
change
its
mind
if
this
court
now
decides
there
it
should
be
a
better
rule
for
fixing
the
boundary
and
the
reason
why
we
think
that
this
court
ought
to
say
that
the
boundary
follows
the
state
law
is
because
if
this
court
goes
to
all
the
trouble
of
formulating
a
rule
to
divide
uplands
from
tidelands,
the
rule
will
apply
in
alaska,
washington
and
oregon.
it
won't
apply
in
california
because
they
don't
make
the
claims
we
make.
it
won't
apply
in
texas
because
they're
not
a
public
land
state.
it
won't
apply
in
the
gulf
if
there's
one
tide
a
day
because
that
would
lead
to
a
different
formulation
and
it
won't
apply
in
the
other
13
states
because
they
were
the
original
states.
so
we
don't
think
that
this
court
should
be
making
real
property
law
for
one
state
or
three
states.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
that's
before
the
court
today
is
unusually
complicated
by
the
fact
that
it's
hard
to
communicate
in
understanding
of
the
problem
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
attempting
to
solve.
what
we
have
in
the
state
of
washington
is
a
westerly
boundary
line
which
borders
on
the
pacific
ocean.
now,
the
state
of
washington
neighbor
to
the
south
is
the
state
of
oregon,
the
columbia
river
divides
oregon
from
washington.
then
from
the
columbia
river
north,
we
have
a
long
sliver,
a
long
piece
of
land
which
runs
almost
directly
north
called
the
long
beach
peninsula
and
it's
separated
from
the
mainland
via
bay,
willapa
bay.
then
you
proceed
north
to
another
stretch
of
ocean
beach
until
you
come
to
grays
harbor
which
is
another
inlet
and
then
the
beach
continues
north
until
the
straits
of
juan
de
fuca.
now
the
strait
is
the
entrance
to
the
great
puget
sound
and
hood
canal,
the
large
and
internal
waterway
of
the
state
of
washington.
now,
the
area
we're
talking
about
is
that
area
of
the
state
which
borders
the
pacific
ocean
and
the
reason
we're
talking
about
it
is
that
from
the
columbia
river
to
the
tip
of
the
long
beach
peninsula
and
then
that
little
beach
between
willapa
bay
and
grays
harbor
and
then
a
portion
of
the
beach
north
along
the
olympic
peninsula
has
been
building
up
by
a
slow
imperceptible
accretion.
alluvium
has
been
deposited
along
the
shore.
what
--
well,
i
suppose
the
boundary
no
longer
is
the
boundary.
the
boundary
is
moving
to
the
west.
it's
moving
seaward.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
your
honor
knows
the
northern
part
of
the
coast
is
the
olympic
peninsula
and
the
coastal
area
is
part
of
the
olympic
national
park.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
in
this
area
where
the
olympic
national
park
is
concerned,
the
accretion
problem
does
not
exist.
the
accretion
then
commence
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
oh!
no.
i
--
in
the
area
adjacent
to
the
olympic
peninsula,
the
boundary
has
remained
constant
so
far
as
i
know.
inside
some
of
the
bays
as
for
instance
inside
port
willapa
in
an
area
that
we're
not
concerned
with
there
has
been
eroded.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
wouldn't
as
i
will
explain
the
state
law,
it
calls
for
a
fixing
of
a
permanent
line
so
that
the
state
either
loses
when
there
is
accretion
moving
the
line
westerly
nor
gains
when
there
is
an
erosion
moving
a
line
easterly.
now,
i
--
now
the
reason
that
this
case
is
so
important
to
the
state
is
that
this
is
the
ocean
beach
for
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
the
ocean
recreational
area
for
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
the
part
of
the
state
where
the
people
have
always
used
the
ocean
and
since
1901,
the
beach
has
been
formally
dedicated
to
the
public.
now,
i
have
on
the
board
a
large
diagram.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
it
is
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
this
will
be
one
of
the
problems
that
the
court
will
want
to
--
can
turn
itself
with.
now,
we're
going
to
be
talking
about
state
law
and
then
the
question
is,
is
there
some
federal
reason,
is
there
some
federal
ground
whereby
this
court
without
a
statute
directing
it
to
do
it
without
a
constitutional
provision
compelling
it
to
do
it.
whether
this
court
is
going
to
step
in
and
change
the
state
law.
now,
if
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
probably
for
such
extensive
areas,
it
might
be
unique
but
i'm
sure
that
there
is
the
problem
of
accretion.
but
if
there
were
a
problem
of
accretion
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well
of
course,
if
it
would
be
the
same
principle
that
we
have
here,
the
land
would
be
building
out
to
sea,
it
would
be
building
east
on
the
atlantic
whereas
it
builds
west
on
the
pacific
where
we
are.
but
as
we
will
find
out,
no
one
contends
that
this
court
would
have
any
concern
at
all
with
that
eastern
boundary
and
this
will
be
part
of
our
problem
to
explain
to
the
court.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
position
that's
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
supported
by
the
solicitor
general
is
that
the
rule
that
they're
asking
this
court
to
intervene
solely
on
the
ground
that
washington
is
a
public
land
state
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
property
we're
talking
about
here
today
was
owned
by
the
government
until
1866
but
not
since.
the
government
is
private
with
all
title
to
this
property
in
1866.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
--
if
perhaps
could
be
common
with
alaska
or
oregon.
it
will
not
--
the
government's
or
the
solicitor's
position
and
petitioner's
position
would
not
affect
california.
it
would
not
affect
texas.
it
will
not
affect
the
gulf
states.
it
will
just
be
the
states
that
i
mentioned.
now
i
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
this
is
not
the
fact
but
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
not
to
the
consequence
of
the
state.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
suspect
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yeah,
under
washington
law
which
may
not
be
a
general
law.
under
washington
state
law,
if
obstructions
are
placed
in
a
navigable
stream
so
as
to
carry
away
a
bank
that
constitutes
an
unconstitutional
damage
in
taking
the
property.
it's
a
--
if
this
is
washington
state
law
under
the
washington
state
constitution
so
then
if
the
state
would
build
a
bulk
head
to
divert
the
stream
and
to
carry
away
land
that
would
--
the
state
would
have
to
pay
for
it.
now,
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case
and
i
can
best
illustrate
the
two
issues
with
the
large
diagram
which
is
on
the
board
and
i
want
to
digress
for
a
moment,
the
large
diagram
is
a
picture.
it's
--
it's
not
drawn
to
scale.
i'm
using
it
simply
because
the
exhibit
that
is
before
the
court
is
down
below
there
and
it's
not
large
enough
for
me
to
see
it
and
i'm
sure
the
court
can't
read
it.
now,
mr.
miller
is
with
me
here,
mr.
miller
point
to
--
on
a
large
diagram
a
line
which
represents
in
the
underlined.
now,
what
we're
dealing
with
is
property
which
would
be
to
the
right
or
the
east
of
the
underlined
as
originally
surveyed
by
the
surveyor
general
for
the
united
states,
well,
those
lands
were
public
lands.
from
that
point
to
the
west,
mr.
miller
--
the
next
line
that's
marked
on
there
represents
a
point
to
which
the
build
up
of
the
land
had
proceeded
from
the
time
of
original
meandering
to
the
date
of
washington
statehood
which
was
1889.
from
that
line
then,
we
move
to
the
next
line
where
we
still
represent
an
area
of
build
up
by
accretion.
the
area
between
the
last
two
lines
represents
the
build
up
that
took
place
during
statehood
or
after
1889.
then
from
the
point
mr.
miller
is
pointing
to
now,
we
can
go
west
to
the
--
to
a
line
which
represents
the
line
of
mean
high
tide,
calculated
according
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
and
then
of
course
westerly
of
that
line
is
simply
a
beach.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
a
title
dispute
and
it
concerns
the
lands
which
were
formed
by
accretion
since
statehood
that
is
the
area
that's
been
pointed
out
now.
we
also
have
a
dispute
over
the
top
portion
of
the
beach
proper,
the
area
between
the
line
there
and
the
line
up
above.
the
line
on
the
left
again
is
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
mean
high
tide.
the
line
on
the
right
is
the
line
of
vegetation.
now
these
two
lines
are
different.
greatly,
when
we
talk
about
the
vegetation
line
which
is
the
top
line,
which
is
the
line
which
marks
the
limits
of
tide
lands
according
to
washington
law.
we're
talking
about
a
line
which
the
water
impresses
upon
the
soil
by
covering
it
for
sufficient
periods
of
time
to
destroy
vegetation
and
to
make
the
lands
value
this
for
agriculture.
this
definition
is
the
same
definition
which
the
state
of
washington
uses
to
locate
water
boundaries
of
lakes,
and
rivers
of
streams,
it's
the
same
definition
which
the
united
states
uses
when
it
measures
the
extent
of
its
navigational
servitude.
it's
a
commonly
understood
concept.
it's
a
commonly
applied
concept
and
that
marks
the
limits
of
tidelands
according
to
washington
law.
the
second
line,
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
line
is
a
mathematical
computation
on
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
we
have
tides
--
high
tides
twice
daily.
i
understand
that
this
is
the
situation
similar
phenomenon
on
the
atlantic
side
of
the
united
states
whereas
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
there
is
but
one
high
tide
and
low
tide
per
day
according
to
the
classifications
of
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic.
now,
twice
a
day
then
the
tides
flow
from
the
left
to
the
right
up
the
beach.
one
of
these
tides
is
higher
than
the
other
tide.
so
we
have
one
higher
high
tide,
one
lower
high
tide.
and
these
high
tides
then
that
we
have
actually
flowing
on
the
beach
are
converted
to
mathematical
calculations
by
the
u.s.
coast
and
geodetic
which
eliminates
any
action
on
the
water
by
spacious,
by
winds,
by
storms,
by
run
on
the
beach,
it
reduces
tide
level
to
a
mathematical
representation
of
the
forces
which
the
sun
and
the
moon
exert
upon
the
water.
it's
a
theoretical
concept
so
then
this
is
what
professor
corker
calls
the
waveless
ocean
from
which
they
start
to
work
their
formula.
now,
then
they
take
the
--
they
take
the
changes
in
the
tides,
their
formulas
and
spread
them
over
a
year,
a
period
of
19
years
and
then
they
calculate
an
average
so
they
will
have
these
averages.
they
will
have
mean
higher
high
tide
with
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
no.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
difference
between
--
the
difference
between
mean
high
tide
and
the
line
of
vegetation
is
the
major
difference
between
us.
the
area
of
the
beach
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
accretion
matter
is
a
major
issue
but
it
involves
a
175
feet
of
--
above
the
beach.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is
and
if
we
don't,
we
do
not
wait.
but
if
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
i
--
the
vegetation
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
your
honor
is
that
--
your
honor
is
right.
the
--
if
we're
sustained
on
accretion
then
the
matters
that
we're
talking
about
now
are
taken
into
consideration
only
when
we
determine
that
1889
dividing
line.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
when
we
talk
about
the
beach
proper,
when
we
talk
about
the
vegetation
line,
we
talk
about
a
line
that
changes
as
the
reach
of
the
water
changes
because
it's
a
line
which
the
water
establishes.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
--
on
this
property
here,
the
growth
of
the
beach
has
been
175
feet.
the
case
before
the
court,
it
has
been
175
feet.
there
are
cases
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
the
growth
rate
has
been
constant.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
since
1889
which
is
the
date
of
washington
statehood.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
patent
was
in
1866.
the
meander
line
was
established
in
my
recollection
is
approximately
1858
between
the
meander
line
and
the
1889
line.
now
this
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
there
is
approximately
350
feet
of
accretion
prior
to
statehood.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
at
this
particular
respondent,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
precisely
the
position
we
take.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
take
the
position
that
number
one,
wash
on
--
first
of
all,
we
should
divide
this
between
the
accretion
problem
and
the
beach
problem.
both
questions
i
must
necessarily
accreted
both
of
them
but
in
argument
i
must
divide
them
to
make
my
position
understandable.
on
the
accretion
problem,
we
recognize
that
the
common
law
prior
to
washington
became
a
state,
then
our
constitution
destroyed
riparian
rights,
all
of
them.
the
right
of
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
this
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
your
honor,
the
explanation
is
this.
we
assert
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
change
the
common
law
as
it
affects
privately
owned
lands
but
our
washington
supreme
court
denies
that
washington
law
has
the
power
to
change
the
common
law
as
it
pertains
to
the
lands
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
have
a
constitutional
problem
then
which
would
be
another
problem.
the
ownership
of
the
beach,
the
ownership
of
the
tidelands
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
property
it
acquired
at
the
time
it
became
a
state
was
a
property
it
acquired
as
an
incident
of
its
sovereignty,
it
was
not
by
granting
the
federal
government.
under
pollard
versus
hagan
we
learned
that
ownership
of
tidelands
goes
with
sovereignty
and
the
sovereignty
it
goes
with
is
state
sovereignty
just
as
we
learned
in
united
states
versus
california
that
the
ownership
of
offshore
lands
is
an
incident
of
sovereignty
but
in
that
case,
it's
an
incident
of
national
or
federal
sovereignty.
and
then
the
question
would
be
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
constitutional
doctrine
whether
the
united
states
which
is
borrowed
by
the
equal
footing
doctrine
from
subtracting
from
the
state,
that
sovereignty
which
other
--
the
original
13
states
had
whether
--
because
the
original
13
states
would
have
the
right
to
change
the
common
law
whether
the
federal
government
could
have
denied
the
state
that
right.
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
answer
the
question
but
that
is
not
the
problem
here
because
the
patent
does
not
say
anything
about
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
your
honor.
it
was
by
virtue
of
the
common
law
which
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
not
a
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
common
law
control
--
the
right
to
accretion
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
joy
versus
st.
louis,
a
case
which
must
be
read
and
must
be
understood
on
the
question
of
accretion,
joy
versus
st.
louis
in
volume
203
of
united
states
reports.
the
court
explicitly
said
that
the
right
to
accretion
under
the
patent
given
by
the
government
was
riparian
right.
the
court
specifically
said
that
an
issue
over
that
accretion
was
not
a
federal
question
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
1889.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
there
--
we
do
concede
that
there
are
limits
beyond
which
the
state
cannot
go
but
we
are
not
exceeding
them
here.
now
the
right
of
this
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
or
put
it
better
yet,
once
the
federal
government
gave
its
patent.
the
land
ought
to
be
treated
the
same
as
if
that
patent
had
been
given
by
great
britain
or
spain,
by
mexico
or
by
the
state
subject
to
general
law.
now,
the
power
of
a
state
to
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
under
common
law
until
it's
changed,
the
riparian
owner
will
get
the
accretion
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
so
far
as
the
federal
question
is
concerned,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that
would
have
been
the
rule
but
nobody
would
challenge
the
state
law
if
we
had
a
grant
from
great
britain.
the
arguments
made
that
this
court
should
intervene.
in
this
case
for
the
simple
and
sole
and
the
only
reason
that
the
patent
was
given
by
the
government
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
we
think
that
it
makes
no
sufficient
case
for
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
and
--
no,
it
does
not
accept
that
if
it's
made
after
statehood,
of
course
the
accretions
that
have
formed
after
the
date
of
patent
would
go
to
the
patent
deed.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
because
i'm
speaking
about
after
statehood,
your
honor.
prior
to
statehood,
the
accretions
that
had
formed
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
would.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
now,
i
want
to
have
mr.
miller
point
out
at
present
time
the
beach.
in
1901,
this
beach
was
dedicated
to
the
public
and
we've
illustrated
the
area
that
the
public
had
their
rights
in
up
to
the
top
of
the
beach
and
administratively
it
was
construed
that
this
beach
included
that
a
175
feet
of
accretion,
that
portion
there,
our
supreme
court
leaves
us
in
doubt.
the
legislature
after
the
decision
of
the
court
then
comes
in
and
speaks
unmistakably,
we
gave
a
seashore
conservation
area
which
extends
from
extreme
low
tides
or
else
we
can
get
up
to
the
vegetation
line
and
that
is
a
public
beach
now.
the
accretion
between
the
public
deeds
is
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
seashore
conservation
area
access
and
other
things
that
can
be
used
in
connection
with
the
beach.
now,
when
we
talk
--
the
question
about
changing
the
common
law
doctrine
of
accretion,
now
that
question
has
been
before
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
construing
a
california
statute.
the
california
statute
was
subsequently
reinterpreted
by
the
california
court
in
a
different
way
than
the
court
of
appeals
had
it
interpreted
it.
but
nonetheless,
the
western
pacific
case,
western
pacific
railroad
versus
southern
pacific
company
is
the
california
case
which
delves
into
the
problem
and
justifies
the
state's
power
to
change
accretion
if
for
instance
you
have
a
sloping
beach
and
the
state
fills
along
the
top
of
the
beach
disregarding
the
accretion
problem.
but
if
our
--
yes,
if
the
state
builds
across
the
top
of
the
beach,
that
fixes
the
line.
the
state
can
do
any
number
of
things,
it
could
put
those
bulkheads
which
would
cause
the
beach
to
build
up
and
this
would
fix
the
property
line
and
all
we're
doing
here
is
accomplishing
the
same
thing
by
a
law
rather
than
sending
a
man
out
that
would
pick
and
shovel
to
pick
the
dirt
up
to
fix
the
line,
you
do
it
by
law.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
the
area
that
we
are
primarily
interested
in,
the
adjacent
lands
are
almost
entirely
privately
own.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yeah,
in
front
of
those.
yes.
we
--
the
tide
lands
that
built
up
so
that
once
lands
which
were
tidelands
are
raised
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
by
the
deposit
of
alluvium
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
we
do
not
take
land
at
the
expense
of
the
private
owners.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
it
settles
on
the
tide
lands.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
always
settles
on
tidelands
and
builds
the
tidelands
up
so
that
the
tidelands
are
raised
above
the
level
of
the
ocean.
it
does
not
deprive
the
private
owner
of
any
property.
what
the
private
owner
insists
on
in
this
case
is
a
rule
of
law
which
will
let
in
acquired
title
to
the
lands
which
once
were
tidelands.
lands
which
concededly
once
were
state
owned.
he
wants
to
acquire
tideland
property.
he
wants
to
acquire
it
or
he
wants
to
acquire
it
when
the
alluvium
deposit
raises
the
level
of
the
tideland
above
the
level
of
the
ocean.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
state
taking
property
away.
it's
a
question
of
the
property
owner
enhancing
its
ownership
by
extending
it.
now,
we
believe
that
this
common
law
doctrine
by
which
the
property
owner
could
do
that
can
be
modified
by
the
state
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
modifies
the
common
law
owner's
right
to
take
water
from
a
stream,
this
riparian
right
to
take
water.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
most
definitely
did
own
it
before
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
the
state
not
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
owned
the
land
before
the
accretion
settled
on.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
private
owner
seeks
a
principle
of
law
which
lets
him
extend
his
ownership,
widen
his
ownership.
that's
the
case
that
we
have.
now,
the
interesting
thing
that
we
speak
about
accretion
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
any
right
to
pass
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no
statute.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
review
the
wisdom
of
a
state
law.
i
think
that
it's
foreclosed
and
i
think
that
there's
a
federal
interest
which
lets
this
court
step
into
this
area.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
federal
government
has
had
no
ownership
that's
affected
by
this
case
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
this
--
the
government's
successors
acquired
their
title
in
1866
and
under
a
principle
of
law
that
applied
until
the
state
of
washington
changed
it,
they
were
able
to
extend
their
ownership
westward.
then
the
state
of
washington
change
this
ownership
--
change
this
rule
of
law
and
said
that
henceforth,
the
titled
state
is
right
where
it
was,
the
boundary
will
not
move.
now,
on
both
of
the
issues
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
this
point,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
state's
position
and
the
state's
right
to
do
what
the
state
of
washington
has
done
is
not
a
startling
proposition.
when
for
instance
the
line
of
vegetation
versus
the
mean
high
tide
line,
the
state
of
washington
is
doing
nothing
more
than
develop
the
common
law
and
they're
developing
it
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
san
francisco
versus
le
roy
which
was
decided
about
the
time
washington
became
a
state.
san
francisco
versus
le
roy,
the
vegetation
line
rule
is
still
the
rule
which
the
secretary
of
interior
instructs
his
own
employees
to
follow
and
section
520
of
the
manual
of
instructions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
manuals
speaks
of
the
problem
of
accretion
and
the
bureau
of
land
management
is
instructed
to
serve
an
accretion
in
front
of
the
public
domain
only
if
that
accretion
would
be
privately
owned
if
it
were
in
front
of
private
uplands.
in
other
words,
the
recognition
is
found
by
the
national
government's
land
administrator
of
the
possibility
of
the
state
rules
of
the
kind
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
to
both
questions.
this
would
be
to
find
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
this
court
--
i
think
that
the
accretion
language
has
been
directed
primarily
to
rivers,
however,
we
follow
the
moving
boundary
on
rivers
in
washington.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no,
it
includes
the
pacific
ocean
because
these
instructions
primarily
relate
to
the
--
they
relate
to
the
public
domain
which
is
the
western
state
primarily.
now,
the
situation
that
we've
got
here
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
washington
law
recognizes
moving
boundaries
on
rivers.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
by
a
reason
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
have
no
man's
land.
we
have
--
we
know
what
the
law
is
on
rivers
and
streams.
we
know
what
the
law
is
on
the
ocean.
it's
a
matter
of
dispute
frankly
as
to
how
this
law
will
be
applied
to
the
anterior
waterways.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
think
it's
by
accident.
when
we
deal
with
--
when
we
deal
with
property
law,
we're
very
much
concerned
with
the
certainty
and
definiteness
and
we
want
to
know
what's
happened
before.
for
instance,
in
this
area
of
the
public
beach
on
that
long
beach
peninsula
that
i
was
telling
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that's
what
the
washington
supreme
court
said
in
a
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it's
not
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it's
not
logical,
your
honor,
but
that
is
the
washington
law
and
we
cannot
--
we
must
accept
it
and
the
court
--
the
court
i
think
will
adhere
to
this
prior
river
case
and
go
forth
and
recognize
the
accreted
title
because
of
the
rules
of
property.
just
as
in
the
cases
that
we
have
here
in
the
vicinity
of
this
lawsuit,
there
have
been
a
series
of
73
cases
affecting
over
3
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
definitely.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
the
same
rule.
but
rules
of
property
are
very
important
and
it's
important
that
they'd
be
conducted
and
formulated
at
a
local
level.
professor
corker
who
is
cited
by
--
we
all
cite
him.
professor
corker
is
very
upset
with
the
washington
supreme
court
in
what
it
did.
but
the
way
he
puts
it
is
this,
he
said,
if
they're
wrong,
they
have
the
right
to
be
wrong.
now,
i
don't
agree
with
him
about
his
judgment
of
washington
law
but
i
do
agree
with
him
about
the
fact
that
it's
a
state
matter
and
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
state
of
oregon
so
far
as
i
know
has
no
appellate
decisions.
but
the
state
of
oregon
has
a
statute
which
has
deprived
the
upland
owners
of
a
title
to
accretion
or
reliction
formed
after
1917
along
navigable
lakes.
we
have
cited
the
statute.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
just
along
navigable
lakes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
alaska
has
no
law.
i
would
--
no,
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
report
either
in
their
statutes
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
that
--
there
was
a
suggestion
that
at
the
time
of
the
government's
patent,
there
may
have
been
so
much
land
between
the
meander
line
and
the
ocean
that
the
government's
patent
would
not
appear
a
title
to
the
ocean
but
that
was
merely
a
suggestion
offered
by
the
solicitor
in
order
to
round
out
the
body
of
the
law
and
that
is
not
a
problem
in
this
case
as
i
understand
the
solicitor's
prefound
the
merits.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
it's
very
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
well,
the
theory
would
be
that
when
the
government
gave
its
patent
it
expected
the
land
that
it
would
convey
to
be
approximately
the
acreage
shown
in
the
government
survey.
if
that
meander
line
was
grossly
out
of
place,
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
it
could
not
have
intended
to
give
10
miles
of
land.
they
simply
intended
to
give
the
acreage
on
the
survey
and
they
cite
a
decision
of
the
interior
department
and
i
believe
there
is
a
judicial
authority
which
would
support
them
but
that
is
not
a
problem
in
our
particular
case.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
the
--
we're
talking
here
about
something
that
it's
all
together
different.
we're
talking
about
beach
in
front
of
the
property.
we're
not
--
we
don't
have
the
problem
where
the
government,
the
national
government
or
the
federal
government
has
any
claim.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
they
would
not
--
they
would
not
except
under
that
one
distinction,
that
one
convincing
problem
that
i
just
spoke
to.
the
federal
government
has
no
interest
in
any
of
this
land
that
we're
talking
about
today
and
it
owns
very
little
land
in
the
southern
part
of
the
ocean
beach,
the
southerly
part
where
the
bulk
of
the
accretions
have
gone.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i'd
be
here
on
the
ocean
beach
issue.
i
would
not
be
here
on
the
accretion
issue.
i'd
be
here
on
the
definition
of
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
the
accretion
issue.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
would
be
here
on
the
disagreement
for
the
top
part
of
the
beach
because
we
can
turn
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
contend
that
the
state
owned
it
and
we
would
contend
that
that
boundary
line
again
is
located
by
a
legal
rule
or
a
common
law
rule.
we
adopted
our
rule
which
was
this
court's
rule.
we
adopted
this
court's
rule
at
about
the
time
of
statehood
and
what
we
say
is
that
since
it's
a
reasonable
and
more
rational
and
more
logical
extension
or
development,
if
you
will,
of
the
common
law
that
this
court
ought
to
accept
it
that
this
court
ought
not
to
attempt
to
follow
a
rule
like
the
borax
rule
theoretical
rule
which
fixes
through
a
mathematical
formula
which
fixes
a
boundary
in
this
case,
386
feet
below
the
bottom
of
the
beach
as
one
attorney
remarked
to
me,
it's
not
the
wisdom
of
solomon
to
cut
the
beach
in
half.
we
think
that
the
state
has
the
freedom
to
develop
the
common
law
concept
of
what's
the
ordinary
limit
of
the
tidelands
which
the
state
would
own
irrespective
of
the
accretion
issue.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
don't
think
it
does
but
professor
corker
in
this
article
disagrees
with
me
and
i
have
stated
in
the
brief
for
that
reason,
i
have
stated
that
if
it
does,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
say
that
the
state
of
washington
can
adopt
any
rule
it
wishes.
it
can
adopt
the
borax
rule,
it
can
adopt
the
vegetation
line
rule,
it
could
adopt
the
californian
mean
high
tide
line
rule
and
--
but
the
borax
case
and
how
i
have
construed
it.
in
borax,
the
problem
of
the
argument
was
different
in
borax,
dealing
without
a
record,
dealing
on
the
basis
of
the
assumptions
of
counsel,
the
purpose
of
the
impression
that
the
line
of
vegetation,
that
the
line
that
we're
seeking
here
was
below
the
line
of
mean
high
tide.
now,
the
normal
way
to
resolve
an
issue
such
as
that
would
have
been
for
this
court
to
say
that
if
that's
the
case,
it's
no
concern
of
ours
but
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
the
rule
that
was
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
applied
as
a
federal
rule
and
on
its
face,
the
case
simply
says
hat
a
state
may
not
disclaim
interest
in
land
below
the
mean
high
tide
line.
that's
what
it
said
on
its
face
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
united
states
your
honor,
we
would
have
a
changing
line,
an
ambulatory
line.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
united
states
could
sell
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it
could
sell
it,
yes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
we
would
say
vegetation
line,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
if
this
court
nullifies
the
state
law
then
this
court
will
have
to
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
it
could.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
it
could.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
the
new
purchaser
would
own
more
land
than
mrs.
hughes
because
they
--
well,
the
government
is
owner
--
the
accretion
rule
can't
be
changed
by
the
state
and
therefore
the
government
acquires
state
land
to
the
doctrine
of
accretion
whereas
mrs.
hughes
who
is
subject
to
state
law
does
not
acquire
it.
one
would
have
a
boundary
that
would
be
seaward
to
the
other.
when
the
government
if
today
made
a
conveyance,
its
patentee
would
take
the
same
land
that
the
government
had
but
of
course
the
government's
patentee
would
take
subject
to
the
right
of
the
state
change
the
law
and
of
course
state
law
does
become
operative
at
that
point
and
the
owner
who
took
today
would
not
then
be
able
to
extend
his
ownership
through
accretion
in
the
future
but
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes,
your
honor
and
that
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
i
argue
that
question
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
against
us
and
that
is
the
case
that's
cited
to
the
court
as
washington
versus
united
states.
because
of
that
case,
the
washington
supreme
court
gave
--
the
washington
supreme
court
said
that
that
case
binds
them.
they
construe
that
case
as
announcing
a
federal
law,
announcing
federal
law
that
the
state
couldn't
change
the
rule
of
accretion
and
the
washington
supreme
court
then
acknowledged
this
federal
case,
this
ninth
circuit
case.
that's
the
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
on
the
basis
that
--
well,
the
federal
government
is
the
owner
of
the
property.
the
state
is
powerless
to
change
the
law
which
affects
the
federal
ownership.
under
the
federal
constitution
the
congress
has
the
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
concerning
the
public
domain,
the
congress
and
not
the
state.
so
this
is
the
distinction.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
federal
law
which
incorporate
state
law
as
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
yes.
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
no.
most
definitely,
we
can
square
that.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
inconsistent,
no.
the
--
you
have
a
problem
of
putting
a
line
between
the
federal
ownership
and
the
state
ownership.
we're
assuming
that
the
federal
owner
today
and
the
state
tideland
owner
today
have
to
have
a
boundary
between
them.
what
we
insist
is
that
since
we
all
agreed
that
this
is
a
common
law
concept,
the
federal
law
should
follow
the
state
law
and
--
mr.
harold
t.
hartinger
in
one
case,
we're
talking
about
a
change
in
law
applicable
to
the
federal
government.
in
the
other
case,
we're
talking
about
the
development
of
real
property
law.
it's
not
a
change
of
law.
we
have
a
state
rule
which
is
founded
directly
on
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
that
was
decided
in
about
1890,
very
close
to
statehood
and
we
followed
that
rule
and
we
are
simply
asking
that
this
court
not
force
us
to
change
its
mind
if
this
court
now
decides
there
it
should
be
a
better
rule
for
fixing
the
boundary
and
the
reason
why
we
think
that
this
court
ought
to
say
that
the
boundary
follows
the
state
law
is
because
if
this
court
goes
to
all
the
trouble
of
formulating
a
rule
to
divide
uplands
from
tidelands,
the
rule
will
apply
in
alaska,
washington
and
oregon.
it
won't
apply
in
california
because
they
don't
make
the
claims
we
make.
it
won't
apply
in
texas
because
they're
not
a
public
land
state.
it
won't
apply
in
the
gulf
if
there's
one
tide
a
day
because
that
would
lead
to
a
different
formulation
and
it
won't
apply
in
the
other
13
states
because
they
were
the
original
states.
so
we
don't
think
that
this
court
should
be
making
real
property
law
for
one
state
or
three
states.
thank
you.
