mr.

there's
a
copy
of
the
open
letter
in
the
record
somewhere.
justice
potter
stewart
right
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kaufmann
what’s
the
reference
to
false
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
this
says
only
if
you
have
anything
you
want
to
take
up
with
the
board
this
is
the
way
you
do
it,
that’s
all
it
says.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
that’s
what
you’re
saying
isn’t
it?
that
this
regulation
whether
you
take
e7
or
e9.
justice
potter
stewart
deals
nothing
with
except
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
board
this
is
the
way
you
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
don’t
want
to
go
to
the
board,
this
regulation
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
to
the
public
or
was
it
addressed
to
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
way
it
reads.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
minute,
i
can
read
it
here.
it
says
an
open
letter
to
the
school
board.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
saying
that’s
not
addressed
to
the
board?
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it
went
there
but
not
in
the
public.
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
mr.
kauffman
did
the
alaska
supreme
court
say
whether
they
believe
this
was
a
letter
to
the
school
board
or
letter
to
public,
what
did
they
say?
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
that
the
regulation
doesn’t
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
you
can’t
read
this
as
a
letter
of
the
school
board,
that
is
a
communication
to
which
the
regulation
would
apply,
you’ve
got
to
read
this
as
a
communication
to
the
general
public
even
though
it
says
local
and
school.
justice
potter
stewart
well
why
isn’t
that
saying
then,
you
say
and
we
should
read
this
as
an
open
letter,
even
though
it
says
open
letter
to
the
school
board,
it’s
really
a
letter
to
the
public
that’s
why
you
said
open,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
we
should
consider
this
case
as
though
the
statute
said
or
the
regulation
said
that
employees
maybe
fired
if
they
criticize
the
superintendent.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
should
it
be
then?
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
they
may
and
sometimes
they
may
not.
