mr.
george
kaufmann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
have
found
the
dismissal
of
petitioners
as
teachers
in
the
public
schools
of
seward,
alaska.
both
petitioners
were
active
and
a
group
of
teachers
who
opposed
policy
of
the
school
board
and
of
its
superintendent
mr.
fibricious
(ph).
in
march
1960,
the
school
board
notified
petitioners
that
their
contracts
would
not
be
renewed
and
advised
them
of
their
rights
under
the
teacher
tenure
law
to
a
hearing
and
of
the
charges
against
it.
after
petitioners
discharge
was
sustained
within
the
state
school
system,
they
brought
suit
in
the
state
courts
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
this
determination.
after
a
lengthy
litigation
which
included
a
summary
reversal
in
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
on
december
7,
1966
by
2:1
vote
rendered
the
judgment
now
under
review.
the
court
held
that
both
petitioners
were
properly
discharged
because
in
may
1959
they
prepared
and
circulated
to
the
public
what
was
called
an
open
letter
to
the
seward
school
board.
this
letter
was
signed
by
the
seward
local
of
the
american
federation
of
teachers,
of
which
petitioner
blue
was
president
and
petitioner
watts
was
secretary.
the
letter
as
reprinted
is
in
appendix
in
the
petitioner’s
brief.
it
starts
up
by
saying
that
it
was
the
union’s
way
of
informing
the
school
board
and
the
public
and
i
quote,
“of
our
stand
in
the
current
struggle
for
a
good
school.
we
hold
the
incidents
occurring
during
the
last
year
have
reached
such
proportions
as
to
be
definitely
detrimental
to
morale
of
our
teaching
staff
and
the
effectiveness
of
our
educational
system.”
the
letter
then
recited
some
of
these
incidents,
most
of
which
cited
around
the
school
superintendent.
impairment
of
job
security
was
the
main
theme
of
the
letter.
the
superintendent
had
repeatedly
threatened
teachers
with
the
loss
of
jobs
and
some
teachers
had
already
lost
their
jobs.
the
letter
objected
also
that
the
administration
created
tension
and
friction
in
the
school,
teachers
had
been
subjected
to
undignified
treatment,
the
fire
regulations
had
been
disregarded
and
discussed
some
other
matters
of
perhaps
less
important.
the
union
explained
in
its
letter
that
the
teachers
had
sought
to
resolve
these
problems
privately,
but
that
the
school
board
had
refused
to
meet
with
them.
the
letter
therefore
requested
an
immediate
public
meeting
with
the
school
board
at
which
the
union
would
press
for
substantial
improvements
and
administrative
policies
and
set
forth
certain
specific
demands.
at
the
hearing
on
their
dismissal
both
petitioners
testified
that
they
had
prepared
the
open
letter
because
all
other
avenues
of
recourse
within
the
school
system
had
been
blocked.
they
felt
the
need
to
inform
and
solicit
the
support
of
the
electorate
to
which
the
school
board
and
the
teachers
were
ultimately
responsible.
now
the
discharge
of
petitioner
blue
rests
exclusively
on
his
part
in
publishing
this
open
letter
to
which
i
have
referred.
but
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
held
against
watts
for
an
additional
reason.
the
court
accepted
a
finding
by
the
school
board
that
watts
had
met
with
two
teachers
mr.
and
mrs.
(inaudible)
and
now
i
quote
the
finding,
“ask
them
if
they
would
go
along
with
the
group”,
of
which
watts
was
a
representative
whose
purpose
was
to
oust
the
superintendent
of
schools.
the
statutory
basis
for
the
court’s
ruling
that
watts
was
subject
to
discharge
for
this
conversation,
was
that
this
was
immorality
within
the
meaning
of
the
alaskan
tenure
statute.
the
court
construed
immorality
as
including
all
conduct
from
the
commission
of
the
most
highness
felony
down
the
scale
of
infamy
to
social
misbehavior.
and
to
this
definition
the
distribution
of
the
open
letter
was
also
found
to
be
immoral
conduct.
but
the
court
ruled
further
that
the
distribution
of
the
open
letter
also
violated
a
school
board
regulation
which
described
the
procedure
for
processing
grievances.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
authoritatively
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
both
the
immorality
provision
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation
on
which
petitioner’s
discharge
is
based
were
both
hopelessly
and
unconstitutionally
vague
and
that
they
were
also
unconstitutionally
over
broad.
we
contend
further
that
petitioner’s
discharge
violates
the
first
amendment.
a
circular
or
open
letter
which
discusses
and
criticizes
the
administration
of
the
public
schools
contributes
to
debate
on
public
issues.
its
publication
is
the
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
an
invitation
to
join
a
group
was
subjective
as
the
oust
of
a
public
official
is
of
the
essence
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
association.
the
central
question
presented
by
this
case
therefore
is
whether
petitioners
maybe
discharged
for
the
exercise
of
these
first
amendment
rights
because
the
public
officials
who
were
involved
were
their
own
superiors
within
the
school
system.
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
these
first
amendment
rights
do
not
exist
for
the
sole
benefit
of
those
who
exercise
it.
they
are
essential
to
the
wellbeing
of
a
democratic
society.
the
public
schools
are
not
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
school
boards
and
school
superintendents,
they
affect
the
entire
community
and
are
properly
a
subject
of
continuing
public
concern.
we
stress
this
point
obvious
though
it
is
because
the
court
below
and
respondents
in
its
brief
have
treated
this
case
as
it
were
simply
a
contest
between
these
petitioners
and
the
school
board.
we
think
that
even
on
this
narrow
view,
petitioners
would
be
entitled
to
prevail,
because
this
court
has
now
discredited
the
document,
that
public
employees
maybe
forced
to
abandon
either
their
jobs
or
their
constitutional
rights.
but
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
for
the
more
fundamental
reason
that
it
fails
to
take
into
account
the
strong
public
interest
in
the
availability
of
information
regarding
the
public
schools.
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
this
court
sharply
circumscribed
the
permissible
scope
of
liable
actions
brought
by
public
officials
against
their
critics.
the
basis
of
this
decisions,
we
understand
was
that
the
fear
of
damage
of
wards
would
cause
even
good
faith
critics
to
withhold
their
criticism
and
would
thereby
deafen
the
vigor
of
public
debate,
contrary
to
the
central
policy
in
the
first
amendment.
and
we
submit
self
censorship
by
public
employees
because
they
feel
the
loss
of
their
jobs
is
equally
destructive
of
the
values
inherent
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
blue
had
taught
at
the
public
schools
of
alaska
for
15
years
before
he
was
discharged.
mr.
watts
had
taught
for
eight
years.
with
their
example,
before
that
no
teachers
would
have
the
temerity
to
risk
the
same
fate
by
voicing
any
public
objection
to
the
actions
of
the
school.
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
would
not
only
penalize
petitioners
for
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights,
it
would
cut
off
from
the
multitude
of
times
a
discussion
of
issues
affecting
the
public
schools,
teachers
who
have
a
particular
information,
insight
and
training
which
can
make
--
which
enables
them
to
make
a
substantial
and
unique
contribution
to
their
discussion.
now
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
laws,
the
discharge
of
these
petitioners
would
substantially
interfere
with
the
objectives
of
first
amendment.
but
we
recognize
also
that
this
court
has
refused
to
give
dogmatic
approval
to
every
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
regardless
of
its
consequences.
and
we
therefore
do
not
contend
that
public
employee
may
never
be
disciplined
where
his
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
is
directed
against
his
own
superior.
that
is
we
can
envision
that
some
situation
would
arise
in
which
the
kind
of
activities
which
involve
in
this
case
might
have
such
a
serious
impact
on
the
morale
and
discipline
of
the
public
school
system
or
with
regard
to
other
public
employees,
to
the
administration
of
government
generally,
that
there
would
be
the
kind
of
an
overriding
public
interest,
which
might
justify
the
subordination
of
the
first
amendment.
but
the
principle
that
this
court
has
established
is
that
the
first
amendment
right
is
entitled
to
prevail,
unless
the
state
can
show
a
subordinating
interest
which
is
compelling.
and
the
formulation
that
we
think
is
particularly
analogous
to
this
case
is
that
wood
against
georgia.
in
wood,
it
was
decided
that
public
criticism
of
the
judge
maybe
punish
this
contemptuous
only
if
the
court
can
show
and
i
quote
in
your
honor’s
opinion,
“a
substantive
evil
actually
designed
to
impede
the
courts
of
justice”.
now
we
submit
that
where
the
claim
is
made,
as
it
is
by
respondents
in
this
case
that
the
first
amendment
right
should
be
held
before
in
the
interest
of
the
administration,
some
other
branch
of
government
than
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
courts
the
same
formulation
should
be
applied.
and
we
submit
that
the
school
board
has
not
come
close
to
showing
that
petitioners
created
a
substantive
evil
actually
designed
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
schools,
or
has
it
demonstrated
to
injury
to
any
other
legitimate
overriding
interest?
i
would
invite
your
honor’s
attention
to
page
66
of
the
appendix,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
footnote
of
page
38
of
our
brief,
where
the
court
below
described
what
it
considered
to
be
the
interest
that
would
justify
the
discharge
of
petitioners
for
circulating
the
open
letter,
here
is
what
the
court
said.
the
overall
binding
effect
of
the
widespread
circulation
of
the
false
statements
and
the
highhanded
method
employed
to
seek
redress
and
disregard
of
established
procedures
could
only
result
in
a
loss
of
respect
by
the
public
for
appellants
and
the
teaching
profession
in
general,
when
all
of
the
facts
became
known
and
was
immoral
conduct
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
it
was
then
defined
by
the
statute.
mr.
george
kaufmann
sir,
the
open
letter
is
reprinted
at
page
1a
of
our
appendix.
it’s
also
--
it’s
the
appendix
of
our
blue
brief
and
it’s
also
reprinted
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
full.
mr.
george
kaufmann
now,
i
say
as
if
the
court
--
as
it
was
then
defined
by
statute
because
after
the
supreme
court
of
alaska’s
first
step
decision
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
that
the
legislature
of
alaska
thought
so
ill
of
that
interpretation
that
they
changed
the
law
and
that
was
why
the
case
was
originally
reversed
by
this
court
to
give
the
supreme
of
alaska
a
chance
to
decide
whether
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
that
new
legislation,
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
preferred
not
to
give
it
retroactive
effect
when
that
argument
was
heard.
mr.
george
kaufmann
there
is
a
finding
by
the
school,
in
the
findings
which
are
appendix
b
to
our
brief,
in
which
they
make
a
finding
that
there
was
--
that
six
of
the
statements
in
the
open
letter
were
false.
it’s
said
in
respondent’s
brief
that
all
but
one
of
the
statements
was
false,
i
think
that
was
just
an
oversight.
we
urge
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
green
brief,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
statements
were
not
false,
but
some
of
them
were
mere
expressions
of
opinion,
that
to
some
extent
the
court
had
--
the
school
board
simply
misinterpreted
the
letter,
but
it’s
our
basic
position
that
the
principle
of
the
new
york
times
--
of
the
new
york
times
case,
that
truth
is
not
the
test
and
the
petitioner’s
testified
and
it’s
pages
at
190
and
219
of
the
record
and
it’s
reprinted
in
the
footnote
of
page
31
of
our
brief
and
it
is
not
challenged
here,
the
petitioners
testified
that
they
believed
in
good
faith
that
everything
that
was
said
in
that
open
letter
was
true.
we
believe
that
the
same
test
that
the
new
york
times
case
is
applicable
here
because
if
under
these
conditions
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
involved
in
the
next
case,
the
school
board
can
make
a
determination
that
the
statements
are
false,
you
are
going
to
cut
it
off
the
debate
the
same
way
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes.
we
think
your
honor
that
there
are
situations
in
which
a
procedure
could
be
established,
which
would
make
available
to
the
public
accurate
information.
but
that’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes,
sir,
we
think
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
it’s
not
true
and
in
fact
it
is
not
true,
because
these
are
matters
which
the
record
shows
are
matters
which
actually
had
been
discussed
with
the
school
board.
they
are
matters
which
had
been
to
called
to
the
superintendent
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
did
base
its
decision
on
the
regulation
and
let
me
address
myself
to
that
now.
it
is
our
position
first
that
the
application
of
that
regulation
is
itself
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
because
it
creates
in
effect
a
prior
censorship.
what
it
is,
is
a
situation
in
which
the
public
official
who
is
being
criticized
is
saying
to
the
respective
critic,
we
will
decide
when
you
can
go
to
the
public
and
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
public
in
having
the
information
is
superior
to
allowing
any
public
official
in
the
normal
situation
unless
there
is
a
particular
reason
for
giving
this
opportunity.
now
the
only
kind
of
case
that
we
can
envision
in
which
there
would
be
a
justification
for
this
kind
of
a
regulation
is
that
in
order
to
allow
these
matters
actually
be
discussed
and
to
be
worked
out
on
an
internal
level
before
going
to
the
public,
we
think
that
it
maybe
that
this
kind
of
a
regulation
would
be
justified.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
in
the
first
place
there
were
no
clear
regulations.
we
have
reprinted
as
appendix
c
of
our
opening
brief,
two
regulations
both
of
which
deal
with
the
subject
of
the
grievance
procedure.
but
we
take
the
position
that
they
are
hopelessly
inconsistent,
the
dissenting
judge
at
pages
102
of
the
appendix
took
the
same
position,
the
superintendent
who
testified
as
to
their
meaning
was
unable
to
explain.
now
we
think
the
least
that’s
necessary
if
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
a
regulation
is
to
be
accomplished
is
that
the
people
know,
not
only
the
school
board
and
the
teachers,
everybody
know
that
this
is
what
you
do
and
then
we’ll
talk
about
it
and
then
after
that
you
can
go
to
the
public.
now
there
is
nothing
of
that
in
this
case.
the
facts
are
quite
the
contrary.
the
whole
history
of
this
litigation
and
the
whole
history
preceding
the
litigation
was
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh,
we
don’t
--
we
are
not
asking
--
no
sir
we
are
not
asking
you
to
reverse
the
finding,
we
are
not
asking
you
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
no
sir
it’s
not
our
position.
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
it’s
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
application
of
the
rule
in
this
situation
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
override
the
first
amendment
interest
in
having
this
information
known
to
the
public--
mr.
george
kaufmann
that
is
correct.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face
because
on
grounds
of
vagueness
and
that
is
not
only
because
of
its
comparison
between
--
with
the
other
regulation
but
also
because
there’s
nothing
in
that
regulation
that
says
anything
about
not
going
to
the
public.
there
is
nothing
in
that
regulation
that
says
anything
about
going
to
the
public,
it
does
not
give
notice
to
these
people
that
before
they
can
talk
to
the
public,
they
must
take
certain
steps.
mr.
george
kaufmann
we
think
this
is
like
republic
steel
against
maddox.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right.
mr.
george
kaufmann
exactly
sir,
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right
and
furthermore,
but
there’s
another
aspect
of
this
and
that
is
that
this
regulation
was
never
applied
in
practice.
because
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
some
discussions,
there
had
been
letters
directly
from
the
union
to
the
school
board
exactly
under
the
same
circumstances
as
this
open
letter
except
for
the
fact
that
the
open
letter
was
to
the
public.
so
that
simply
was
the
objective
of
the
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
was
addressed
to
the
public
and
it
was
called
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
was
--
i
mean,
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right,
i’m
misspoke.
mr.
george
kaufmann
no,
no,
i’m
not
suggesting,
i'm
suggesting
--
it
was
all
--
it
also
went
to
the
--
it
also
went
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
i’m
saying
--
no
what
i
was
saying
sir,
is
that
there
were
previous
letters
from
this
union,
from
the
teachers,
which
were
actual
letters
to
the
school
board
in
which
it
was
never
suggested
that
--
which
the
denied
power
for
the
superintendent
and
which
it
was
never
suggested
that
these
were
violations
of
the
regulation,
and
that
the
only
difference
between
those
letters
and
this
letter
is
that
this
one
was
also
distributed
to
the
public.
and
if
you
read
the
record
in
this
case
this
is
what
they’re
complaining
about.
at
one
point
counsel
for
the
response
and
you
had
the
audacity
to
take
this
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
what?
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
i
think
it’s
not
--
i
think
it’s
a
regulation
that
is
vague
on
it’s
face
that
if
it’s
not
vague
that
there
was
an
entrapment
by
the
whole
practice
and
further
more
that
there
is
simply
not
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
for
one
group
of
public
officials
to
say
you
can’t
go
to
the
public
and
criticize
us
without
checking
with
us.
mr.
george
kaufmann
well,
i
think
they
said
it
was
letter
to
the
school
board,
i
misspoke
it
--
i
was
not
suggesting
that
this
was
not
a
letter,
but
it’s
just
a
terminology.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir.
mr.
george
kaufmann
sir,
my
suggestion
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
offenses
this
case
was
tried
was
that
this
people
distributed
it
to
the
public,
that
that
was
really
what
they
were
being
tried
for
and
that
also
this
is
the
interests
that’s
involved
here
and
that
therefore
the
regulation
was
not
applicable.
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
certainly
was
a
communication
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh
it
was
distributed
all
the
time
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
well
no,
no
sir
that’s
not
right.
that
isn't
always
quite
clear
is
quite
clear
that
its
objective
was
that
after
everything
had
failed
internally
was
to
get
the
support
of
the
public
and
to
call
the
attention
of
the
electorate.
mr.
george
kaufmann
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
and
i
think
it's
been
granted,
it
wouldn't
be
unfair
but
i
think
it
has
been
granted
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
the
question
under
this
court's
decision
is
whether
there's
an
overriding
state
interest
which
justifies
subordinating
them.
now
i
submit
that
the
interest
of
the
school
board
in
knowing
in
advance,
what
the
grievances
are
justice
as
it
was
stated
here
does
not
override
under
our
constitution,
the
interest
of
the
public
of
what's
going
on
in
its
school
system.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interest
which
was
asserted
is
an
insufficient
one.
i
can
imagine
a
situation
in
which
it
ordered
they
have
an
opportunity
to
work
these
things
out
inside
internally
first,
it
would
be
insisted
that
this
kind
of
a
procedure
if
it
was
known
to
be
available
and
if
it
was
available
should
be
followed
first
because
the
public
also
has
an
interest
in
having
these
things
worked
out
if
it
all
possible.
now
it
was
said
that
it
was
--
it
has
been
said
here
that
it
was
the
objective
of
these
people
throughout
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
and
that
this
is
why
they
circulated
the
open
letter.
now
there
is
considerable
testimony
in
this
record
that
the
only
reason
that
they
published
this
open
letter
at
the
time
they
did
was
because
the
whole
process
of
internal
communication
had
broken
down.
and
i'd
like
to
read
to
your
honor
just
one
colloquy
on
this,
was
a
testimony
of
mr.
blue
and
there
is
no
finding,
nothing
to
the
contrary
anywhere
in
this
record.
“you
did
in
fact”,
this
is
a
question
of
mr.
burn,
“you
did
in,”
this
is
at
467
of
the
appendix.
“you
did
in
fact
publish
a
statement
about
mr.
fibricious
(ph)
without
bringing
the
matter
to
his
attention
first.”
“i
participated,”
mr.
blue,
“i
participated
in
the
preparation,
publication
and
distribution
of
this
document,
part
of
which
i
helped
to
prepare,
part
of
which
others
prepared,
it
was
all
prepared
as
far
as
we
can
determine
in
a
truthful
manner
and
it
was
an
open
and
that
didn't
last
--
merely
a
last
resort
to
resolve
a
very
serious
problem
that
affected
the
lives
of
a
great
many
people
and
which
already
had
the
town
in
furor.”
now
it
was
said
that
it
was
--
the
town
was
in
the
furor
and
counsel
for
respondents
said
well
this
is
a
reason
why
they
shouldn't
have
done
this.
as
we
understand
the
first
amendment
that's
one
of
its
objectives
and
one
of
its
consequences,
to
have
public
debate
on
issues
of
public
importance
and
this
very
public
furor
shows
that
in
this
town
of
seward
alaska,
the
operation
and
administration
of
their
public
schools
was
important.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
we
cannot
have
any
information
truthful
or
false
if
the
people
who
are
going
to
give
the
information
have
to
be
the
guarantors
of
the
truth
and
we
submit
that
the
principle
in
the
new
york
times
be
in
this
case
is
quite
indistinguishable.
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
times
case
–-
mr.
george
kaufmann
now
that
was
an
issue
in
new
york
times
also
and
though
the
argument
was
made
that
it
was
all
in
the
files
of
the
--
in
the
morgue
of
the
new
york
times
it
would
have
only
checked
it
out
and
the
argument
was
this
showed
that
they
were
not
in
good
faith.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honors
every
bit
of
this
information
was
known
to
the
school
board
and
was
known
to
the
superintendent.
there
were
matters
in
this
letter
which
had
already
been
dealt
with.
this
was,
although
it
was
addressed
it
was
called
an
open
letter
to
the
school
board,
this
is
only
a
formalism,
what
they
were
doing
here
is
they
were
telling
the
public,
“look
we
have
been
trying
to
work
this
thing
out
internally,
it
just
hasn't
worked
and
we
urge
it
as
the
electorate,
as
the
ultimate
resort
–-
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir,
if
the
finding
--
they
didn't
give
them
false
information
as
to
that,
nobody
made
a
finding,
there
is
a
no
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
that
was
the
finding
below,
which
incidentally
we
challenge
and
i
may
say
that
is
not
binding
on
this
court
and
there
is
another
statement
that
was
made
here
this
morning
which
was
also
supported
by
this
finding
determination
of
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
we
think
is
irrelevant
for
the
reasons
pointed
out
in
our
reply,
but
which
is
--
there
is
no
record
--
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
statement
that
this
was
made
during
school
hours
because
the
person
who
testified
to
that
said,
well,
he
wasn't
sure
and
this
is
also
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
while
there
maybe
situations
to
which
references
made
here
were
if
a
man
campaigns
against
his
own
superior
that
this
would
have
such
an
impact
on
the
moral
and
discipline
that
you
shouldn't
commit
it,
there
may
be
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
the
findings
and
determinations
of
this
statute
by
the
court
below,
this
was
not
an
adequate
basis
and
furthermore
that
the
statute
be
a
morality
statute
so
obviously
unconstitutional
that
it
can't
justify
the
discharge
opinion.
mr.
george
kaufmann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
have
found
the
dismissal
of
petitioners
as
teachers
in
the
public
schools
of
seward,
alaska.
both
petitioners
were
active
and
a
group
of
teachers
who
opposed
policy
of
the
school
board
and
of
its
superintendent
mr.
fibricious
(ph).
in
march
1960,
the
school
board
notified
petitioners
that
their
contracts
would
not
be
renewed
and
advised
them
of
their
rights
under
the
teacher
tenure
law
to
a
hearing
and
of
the
charges
against
it.
after
petitioners
discharge
was
sustained
within
the
state
school
system,
they
brought
suit
in
the
state
courts
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
this
determination.
after
a
lengthy
litigation
which
included
a
summary
reversal
in
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
on
december
7,
1966
by
2:1
vote
rendered
the
judgment
now
under
review.
the
court
held
that
both
petitioners
were
properly
discharged
because
in
may
1959
they
prepared
and
circulated
to
the
public
what
was
called
an
open
letter
to
the
seward
school
board.
this
letter
was
signed
by
the
seward
local
of
the
american
federation
of
teachers,
of
which
petitioner
blue
was
president
and
petitioner
watts
was
secretary.
the
letter
as
reprinted
is
in
appendix
in
the
petitioner’s
brief.
it
starts
up
by
saying
that
it
was
the
union’s
way
of
informing
the
school
board
and
the
public
and
i
quote,
“of
our
stand
in
the
current
struggle
for
a
good
school.
we
hold
the
incidents
occurring
during
the
last
year
have
reached
such
proportions
as
to
be
definitely
detrimental
to
morale
of
our
teaching
staff
and
the
effectiveness
of
our
educational
system.”
the
letter
then
recited
some
of
these
incidents,
most
of
which
cited
around
the
school
superintendent.
impairment
of
job
security
was
the
main
theme
of
the
letter.
the
superintendent
had
repeatedly
threatened
teachers
with
the
loss
of
jobs
and
some
teachers
had
already
lost
their
jobs.
the
letter
objected
also
that
the
administration
created
tension
and
friction
in
the
school,
teachers
had
been
subjected
to
undignified
treatment,
the
fire
regulations
had
been
disregarded
and
discussed
some
other
matters
of
perhaps
less
important.
the
union
explained
in
its
letter
that
the
teachers
had
sought
to
resolve
these
problems
privately,
but
that
the
school
board
had
refused
to
meet
with
them.
the
letter
therefore
requested
an
immediate
public
meeting
with
the
school
board
at
which
the
union
would
press
for
substantial
improvements
and
administrative
policies
and
set
forth
certain
specific
demands.
at
the
hearing
on
their
dismissal
both
petitioners
testified
that
they
had
prepared
the
open
letter
because
all
other
avenues
of
recourse
within
the
school
system
had
been
blocked.
they
felt
the
need
to
inform
and
solicit
the
support
of
the
electorate
to
which
the
school
board
and
the
teachers
were
ultimately
responsible.
now
the
discharge
of
petitioner
blue
rests
exclusively
on
his
part
in
publishing
this
open
letter
to
which
i
have
referred.
but
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
held
against
watts
for
an
additional
reason.
the
court
accepted
a
finding
by
the
school
board
that
watts
had
met
with
two
teachers
mr.
and
mrs.
(inaudible)
and
now
i
quote
the
finding,
“ask
them
if
they
would
go
along
with
the
group”,
of
which
watts
was
a
representative
whose
purpose
was
to
oust
the
superintendent
of
schools.
the
statutory
basis
for
the
court’s
ruling
that
watts
was
subject
to
discharge
for
this
conversation,
was
that
this
was
immorality
within
the
meaning
of
the
alaskan
tenure
statute.
the
court
construed
immorality
as
including
all
conduct
from
the
commission
of
the
most
highness
felony
down
the
scale
of
infamy
to
social
misbehavior.
and
to
this
definition
the
distribution
of
the
open
letter
was
also
found
to
be
immoral
conduct.
but
the
court
ruled
further
that
the
distribution
of
the
open
letter
also
violated
a
school
board
regulation
which
described
the
procedure
for
processing
grievances.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
authoritatively
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
both
the
immorality
provision
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation
on
which
petitioner’s
discharge
is
based
were
both
hopelessly
and
unconstitutionally
vague
and
that
they
were
also
unconstitutionally
over
broad.
we
contend
further
that
petitioner’s
discharge
violates
the
first
amendment.
a
circular
or
open
letter
which
discusses
and
criticizes
the
administration
of
the
public
schools
contributes
to
debate
on
public
issues.
its
publication
is
the
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
an
invitation
to
join
a
group
was
subjective
as
the
oust
of
a
public
official
is
of
the
essence
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
association.
the
central
question
presented
by
this
case
therefore
is
whether
petitioners
maybe
discharged
for
the
exercise
of
these
first
amendment
rights
because
the
public
officials
who
were
involved
were
their
own
superiors
within
the
school
system.
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
these
first
amendment
rights
do
not
exist
for
the
sole
benefit
of
those
who
exercise
it.
they
are
essential
to
the
wellbeing
of
a
democratic
society.
the
public
schools
are
not
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
school
boards
and
school
superintendents,
they
affect
the
entire
community
and
are
properly
a
subject
of
continuing
public
concern.
we
stress
this
point
obvious
though
it
is
because
the
court
below
and
respondents
in
its
brief
have
treated
this
case
as
it
were
simply
a
contest
between
these
petitioners
and
the
school
board.
we
think
that
even
on
this
narrow
view,
petitioners
would
be
entitled
to
prevail,
because
this
court
has
now
discredited
the
document,
that
public
employees
maybe
forced
to
abandon
either
their
jobs
or
their
constitutional
rights.
but
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
for
the
more
fundamental
reason
that
it
fails
to
take
into
account
the
strong
public
interest
in
the
availability
of
information
regarding
the
public
schools.
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
this
court
sharply
circumscribed
the
permissible
scope
of
liable
actions
brought
by
public
officials
against
their
critics.
the
basis
of
this
decisions,
we
understand
was
that
the
fear
of
damage
of
wards
would
cause
even
good
faith
critics
to
withhold
their
criticism
and
would
thereby
deafen
the
vigor
of
public
debate,
contrary
to
the
central
policy
in
the
first
amendment.
and
we
submit
self
censorship
by
public
employees
because
they
feel
the
loss
of
their
jobs
is
equally
destructive
of
the
values
inherent
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
blue
had
taught
at
the
public
schools
of
alaska
for
15
years
before
he
was
discharged.
mr.
watts
had
taught
for
eight
years.
with
their
example,
before
that
no
teachers
would
have
the
temerity
to
risk
the
same
fate
by
voicing
any
public
objection
to
the
actions
of
the
school.
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
would
not
only
penalize
petitioners
for
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights,
it
would
cut
off
from
the
multitude
of
times
a
discussion
of
issues
affecting
the
public
schools,
teachers
who
have
a
particular
information,
insight
and
training
which
can
make
--
which
enables
them
to
make
a
substantial
and
unique
contribution
to
their
discussion.
now
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
laws,
the
discharge
of
these
petitioners
would
substantially
interfere
with
the
objectives
of
first
amendment.
but
we
recognize
also
that
this
court
has
refused
to
give
dogmatic
approval
to
every
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
regardless
of
its
consequences.
and
we
therefore
do
not
contend
that
public
employee
may
never
be
disciplined
where
his
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
is
directed
against
his
own
superior.
that
is
we
can
envision
that
some
situation
would
arise
in
which
the
kind
of
activities
which
involve
in
this
case
might
have
such
a
serious
impact
on
the
morale
and
discipline
of
the
public
school
system
or
with
regard
to
other
public
employees,
to
the
administration
of
government
generally,
that
there
would
be
the
kind
of
an
overriding
public
interest,
which
might
justify
the
subordination
of
the
first
amendment.
but
the
principle
that
this
court
has
established
is
that
the
first
amendment
right
is
entitled
to
prevail,
unless
the
state
can
show
a
subordinating
interest
which
is
compelling.
and
the
formulation
that
we
think
is
particularly
analogous
to
this
case
is
that
wood
against
georgia.
in
wood,
it
was
decided
that
public
criticism
of
the
judge
maybe
punish
this
contemptuous
only
if
the
court
can
show
and
i
quote
in
your
honor’s
opinion,
“a
substantive
evil
actually
designed
to
impede
the
courts
of
justice”.
now
we
submit
that
where
the
claim
is
made,
as
it
is
by
respondents
in
this
case
that
the
first
amendment
right
should
be
held
before
in
the
interest
of
the
administration,
some
other
branch
of
government
than
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
courts
the
same
formulation
should
be
applied.
and
we
submit
that
the
school
board
has
not
come
close
to
showing
that
petitioners
created
a
substantive
evil
actually
designed
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
schools,
or
has
it
demonstrated
to
injury
to
any
other
legitimate
overriding
interest?
i
would
invite
your
honor’s
attention
to
page
66
of
the
appendix,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
footnote
of
page
38
of
our
brief,
where
the
court
below
described
what
it
considered
to
be
the
interest
that
would
justify
the
discharge
of
petitioners
for
circulating
the
open
letter,
here
is
what
the
court
said.
the
overall
binding
effect
of
the
widespread
circulation
of
the
false
statements
and
the
highhanded
method
employed
to
seek
redress
and
disregard
of
established
procedures
could
only
result
in
a
loss
of
respect
by
the
public
for
appellants
and
the
teaching
profession
in
general,
when
all
of
the
facts
became
known
and
was
immoral
conduct
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
it
was
then
defined
by
the
statute.
mr.
george
kaufmann
sir,
the
open
letter
is
reprinted
at
page
1a
of
our
appendix.
it’s
also
--
it’s
the
appendix
of
our
blue
brief
and
it’s
also
reprinted
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
full.
mr.
george
kaufmann
now,
i
say
as
if
the
court
--
as
it
was
then
defined
by
statute
because
after
the
supreme
court
of
alaska’s
first
step
decision
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
that
the
legislature
of
alaska
thought
so
ill
of
that
interpretation
that
they
changed
the
law
and
that
was
why
the
case
was
originally
reversed
by
this
court
to
give
the
supreme
of
alaska
a
chance
to
decide
whether
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
that
new
legislation,
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
preferred
not
to
give
it
retroactive
effect
when
that
argument
was
heard.
mr.
george
kaufmann
there
is
a
finding
by
the
school,
in
the
findings
which
are
appendix
b
to
our
brief,
in
which
they
make
a
finding
that
there
was
--
that
six
of
the
statements
in
the
open
letter
were
false.
it’s
said
in
respondent’s
brief
that
all
but
one
of
the
statements
was
false,
i
think
that
was
just
an
oversight.
we
urge
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
green
brief,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
statements
were
not
false,
but
some
of
them
were
mere
expressions
of
opinion,
that
to
some
extent
the
court
had
--
the
school
board
simply
misinterpreted
the
letter,
but
it’s
our
basic
position
that
the
principle
of
the
new
york
times
--
of
the
new
york
times
case,
that
truth
is
not
the
test
and
the
petitioner’s
testified
and
it’s
pages
at
190
and
219
of
the
record
and
it’s
reprinted
in
the
footnote
of
page
31
of
our
brief
and
it
is
not
challenged
here,
the
petitioners
testified
that
they
believed
in
good
faith
that
everything
that
was
said
in
that
open
letter
was
true.
we
believe
that
the
same
test
that
the
new
york
times
case
is
applicable
here
because
if
under
these
conditions
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
involved
in
the
next
case,
the
school
board
can
make
a
determination
that
the
statements
are
false,
you
are
going
to
cut
it
off
the
debate
the
same
way
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes.
we
think
your
honor
that
there
are
situations
in
which
a
procedure
could
be
established,
which
would
make
available
to
the
public
accurate
information.
but
that’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes,
sir,
we
think
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
it’s
not
true
and
in
fact
it
is
not
true,
because
these
are
matters
which
the
record
shows
are
matters
which
actually
had
been
discussed
with
the
school
board.
they
are
matters
which
had
been
to
called
to
the
superintendent
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
did
base
its
decision
on
the
regulation
and
let
me
address
myself
to
that
now.
it
is
our
position
first
that
the
application
of
that
regulation
is
itself
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
because
it
creates
in
effect
a
prior
censorship.
what
it
is,
is
a
situation
in
which
the
public
official
who
is
being
criticized
is
saying
to
the
respective
critic,
we
will
decide
when
you
can
go
to
the
public
and
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
public
in
having
the
information
is
superior
to
allowing
any
public
official
in
the
normal
situation
unless
there
is
a
particular
reason
for
giving
this
opportunity.
now
the
only
kind
of
case
that
we
can
envision
in
which
there
would
be
a
justification
for
this
kind
of
a
regulation
is
that
in
order
to
allow
these
matters
actually
be
discussed
and
to
be
worked
out
on
an
internal
level
before
going
to
the
public,
we
think
that
it
maybe
that
this
kind
of
a
regulation
would
be
justified.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
in
the
first
place
there
were
no
clear
regulations.
we
have
reprinted
as
appendix
c
of
our
opening
brief,
two
regulations
both
of
which
deal
with
the
subject
of
the
grievance
procedure.
but
we
take
the
position
that
they
are
hopelessly
inconsistent,
the
dissenting
judge
at
pages
102
of
the
appendix
took
the
same
position,
the
superintendent
who
testified
as
to
their
meaning
was
unable
to
explain.
now
we
think
the
least
that’s
necessary
if
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
a
regulation
is
to
be
accomplished
is
that
the
people
know,
not
only
the
school
board
and
the
teachers,
everybody
know
that
this
is
what
you
do
and
then
we’ll
talk
about
it
and
then
after
that
you
can
go
to
the
public.
now
there
is
nothing
of
that
in
this
case.
the
facts
are
quite
the
contrary.
the
whole
history
of
this
litigation
and
the
whole
history
preceding
the
litigation
was
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh,
we
don’t
--
we
are
not
asking
--
no
sir
we
are
not
asking
you
to
reverse
the
finding,
we
are
not
asking
you
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
no
sir
it’s
not
our
position.
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
it’s
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
application
of
the
rule
in
this
situation
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
override
the
first
amendment
interest
in
having
this
information
known
to
the
public--
mr.
george
kaufmann
that
is
correct.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face
because
on
grounds
of
vagueness
and
that
is
not
only
because
of
its
comparison
between
--
with
the
other
regulation
but
also
because
there’s
nothing
in
that
regulation
that
says
anything
about
not
going
to
the
public.
there
is
nothing
in
that
regulation
that
says
anything
about
going
to
the
public,
it
does
not
give
notice
to
these
people
that
before
they
can
talk
to
the
public,
they
must
take
certain
steps.
mr.
george
kaufmann
we
think
this
is
like
republic
steel
against
maddox.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right.
mr.
george
kaufmann
exactly
sir,
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right
and
furthermore,
but
there’s
another
aspect
of
this
and
that
is
that
this
regulation
was
never
applied
in
practice.
because
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
some
discussions,
there
had
been
letters
directly
from
the
union
to
the
school
board
exactly
under
the
same
circumstances
as
this
open
letter
except
for
the
fact
that
the
open
letter
was
to
the
public.
so
that
simply
was
the
objective
of
the
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
was
addressed
to
the
public
and
it
was
called
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
was
--
i
mean,
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
mr.
george
kaufmann
that’s
right,
i’m
misspoke.
mr.
george
kaufmann
no,
no,
i’m
not
suggesting,
i'm
suggesting
--
it
was
all
--
it
also
went
to
the
--
it
also
went
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
i’m
saying
--
no
what
i
was
saying
sir,
is
that
there
were
previous
letters
from
this
union,
from
the
teachers,
which
were
actual
letters
to
the
school
board
in
which
it
was
never
suggested
that
--
which
the
denied
power
for
the
superintendent
and
which
it
was
never
suggested
that
these
were
violations
of
the
regulation,
and
that
the
only
difference
between
those
letters
and
this
letter
is
that
this
one
was
also
distributed
to
the
public.
and
if
you
read
the
record
in
this
case
this
is
what
they’re
complaining
about.
at
one
point
counsel
for
the
response
and
you
had
the
audacity
to
take
this
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
what?
mr.
george
kaufmann
no
sir,
i
think
it’s
not
--
i
think
it’s
a
regulation
that
is
vague
on
it’s
face
that
if
it’s
not
vague
that
there
was
an
entrapment
by
the
whole
practice
and
further
more
that
there
is
simply
not
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
for
one
group
of
public
officials
to
say
you
can’t
go
to
the
public
and
criticize
us
without
checking
with
us.
mr.
george
kaufmann
well,
i
think
they
said
it
was
letter
to
the
school
board,
i
misspoke
it
--
i
was
not
suggesting
that
this
was
not
a
letter,
but
it’s
just
a
terminology.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir.
mr.
george
kaufmann
sir,
my
suggestion
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
offenses
this
case
was
tried
was
that
this
people
distributed
it
to
the
public,
that
that
was
really
what
they
were
being
tried
for
and
that
also
this
is
the
interests
that’s
involved
here
and
that
therefore
the
regulation
was
not
applicable.
mr.
george
kaufmann
it
certainly
was
a
communication
to
the
public.
mr.
george
kaufmann
oh
it
was
distributed
all
the
time
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
well
no,
no
sir
that’s
not
right.
that
isn't
always
quite
clear
is
quite
clear
that
its
objective
was
that
after
everything
had
failed
internally
was
to
get
the
support
of
the
public
and
to
call
the
attention
of
the
electorate.
mr.
george
kaufmann
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
and
i
think
it's
been
granted,
it
wouldn't
be
unfair
but
i
think
it
has
been
granted
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
the
question
under
this
court's
decision
is
whether
there's
an
overriding
state
interest
which
justifies
subordinating
them.
now
i
submit
that
the
interest
of
the
school
board
in
knowing
in
advance,
what
the
grievances
are
justice
as
it
was
stated
here
does
not
override
under
our
constitution,
the
interest
of
the
public
of
what's
going
on
in
its
school
system.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interest
which
was
asserted
is
an
insufficient
one.
i
can
imagine
a
situation
in
which
it
ordered
they
have
an
opportunity
to
work
these
things
out
inside
internally
first,
it
would
be
insisted
that
this
kind
of
a
procedure
if
it
was
known
to
be
available
and
if
it
was
available
should
be
followed
first
because
the
public
also
has
an
interest
in
having
these
things
worked
out
if
it
all
possible.
now
it
was
said
that
it
was
--
it
has
been
said
here
that
it
was
the
objective
of
these
people
throughout
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
and
that
this
is
why
they
circulated
the
open
letter.
now
there
is
considerable
testimony
in
this
record
that
the
only
reason
that
they
published
this
open
letter
at
the
time
they
did
was
because
the
whole
process
of
internal
communication
had
broken
down.
and
i'd
like
to
read
to
your
honor
just
one
colloquy
on
this,
was
a
testimony
of
mr.
blue
and
there
is
no
finding,
nothing
to
the
contrary
anywhere
in
this
record.
“you
did
in
fact”,
this
is
a
question
of
mr.
burn,
“you
did
in,”
this
is
at
467
of
the
appendix.
“you
did
in
fact
publish
a
statement
about
mr.
fibricious
(ph)
without
bringing
the
matter
to
his
attention
first.”
“i
participated,”
mr.
blue,
“i
participated
in
the
preparation,
publication
and
distribution
of
this
document,
part
of
which
i
helped
to
prepare,
part
of
which
others
prepared,
it
was
all
prepared
as
far
as
we
can
determine
in
a
truthful
manner
and
it
was
an
open
and
that
didn't
last
--
merely
a
last
resort
to
resolve
a
very
serious
problem
that
affected
the
lives
of
a
great
many
people
and
which
already
had
the
town
in
furor.”
now
it
was
said
that
it
was
--
the
town
was
in
the
furor
and
counsel
for
respondents
said
well
this
is
a
reason
why
they
shouldn't
have
done
this.
as
we
understand
the
first
amendment
that's
one
of
its
objectives
and
one
of
its
consequences,
to
have
public
debate
on
issues
of
public
importance
and
this
very
public
furor
shows
that
in
this
town
of
seward
alaska,
the
operation
and
administration
of
their
public
schools
was
important.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes.
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
we
cannot
have
any
information
truthful
or
false
if
the
people
who
are
going
to
give
the
information
have
to
be
the
guarantors
of
the
truth
and
we
submit
that
the
principle
in
the
new
york
times
be
in
this
case
is
quite
indistinguishable.
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
times
case
–-
mr.
george
kaufmann
now
that
was
an
issue
in
new
york
times
also
and
though
the
argument
was
made
that
it
was
all
in
the
files
of
the
--
in
the
morgue
of
the
new
york
times
it
would
have
only
checked
it
out
and
the
argument
was
this
showed
that
they
were
not
in
good
faith.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honors
every
bit
of
this
information
was
known
to
the
school
board
and
was
known
to
the
superintendent.
there
were
matters
in
this
letter
which
had
already
been
dealt
with.
this
was,
although
it
was
addressed
it
was
called
an
open
letter
to
the
school
board,
this
is
only
a
formalism,
what
they
were
doing
here
is
they
were
telling
the
public,
“look
we
have
been
trying
to
work
this
thing
out
internally,
it
just
hasn't
worked
and
we
urge
it
as
the
electorate,
as
the
ultimate
resort
–-
mr.
george
kaufmann
yes
sir,
if
the
finding
--
they
didn't
give
them
false
information
as
to
that,
nobody
made
a
finding,
there
is
a
no
--
mr.
george
kaufmann
that
was
the
finding
below,
which
incidentally
we
challenge
and
i
may
say
that
is
not
binding
on
this
court
and
there
is
another
statement
that
was
made
here
this
morning
which
was
also
supported
by
this
finding
determination
of
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
we
think
is
irrelevant
for
the
reasons
pointed
out
in
our
reply,
but
which
is
--
there
is
no
record
--
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
statement
that
this
was
made
during
school
hours
because
the
person
who
testified
to
that
said,
well,
he
wasn't
sure
and
this
is
also
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
while
there
maybe
situations
to
which
references
made
here
were
if
a
man
campaigns
against
his
own
superior
that
this
would
have
such
an
impact
on
the
moral
and
discipline
that
you
shouldn't
commit
it,
there
may
be
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
the
findings
and
determinations
of
this
statute
by
the
court
below,
this
was
not
an
adequate
basis
and
furthermore
that
the
statute
be
a
morality
statute
so
obviously
unconstitutional
that
it
can't
justify
the
discharge
opinion.
