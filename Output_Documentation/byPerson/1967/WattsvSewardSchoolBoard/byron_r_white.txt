justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
kaufmann
do
you
think
the
school
board
though
is
entitled
to
set
up
procedures
so
that
accurate
information
is
the
information
that
will
be
circulated?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
suggestion
that
apparently
the
alaska
supreme
court
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
discharge
is
the
violation
of
the
rule
that
you
are
supposed
to
--
if
have
any
complaints
or
objections
the
ways
the
school
is
being
run
taking
up
administratively
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
had
been
here
and
if
they
had
done
here
perhaps
there
wouldn’t
been
misinformation
get
out
to
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
didn’t
the
alaska
supreme
court
base
its
ruling
partly
on
the
fegard
(ph).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
just
have
to
offset
--
you
just
want
us
to
disagree
with
the
alaska
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
alaska
supreme
court
says
there
was
a
violation
of
this
rule,
you
say
there
wasn’t.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
you
just
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it’s
a
clear
cut
regulation,
it’s
just
an
invalid
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it’s
been
waived
then
the
regulation?
perfectly
clear
regulation
but
it
has
been
waived
--
justice
byron
r.
white
perfectly
clear
regulation,
but
it
has
been
waived.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
on
these
facts
that
made
it
improper
for
the
teachers
to
criticize
the
superintendent
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
all
the
statements
have
been
true
in
this
case,
you
would
still
be
taking
the
same
position
won't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
was
that
one
of
the
grounds
the
alaska
supreme
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
mr.
watts
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
only
claim
is
on
blue,
is
that
if
the
statements
had
been
true,
his
only
violation
would
have
been
the
seventh
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
was
--
and
that
once
he
took
his
complaint
to
superintendent,
and
the
superintendent
did
nothing
about
it.
he
went
to
the
superintendent
and
says,
“here
are
the
grievances
i
have
against
you,
i
think
you
are
doing
a
terrible
job
and
this
is
not
--”
that
he
would
then
have
been
perfectly
free
to
go
the
public
with
an
open
letter
as
long
as
the
statements
were
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
would
he
have
been
free
to
go
the
public,
because
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wouldn't
you
think
in
that
circumstance
though
that
new
york
times
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
he
satisfied
the
e7
regulation,
he
went
to
superintendent
nothing
happened
and
he
satisfied
the
regulation
and
then
he
went
to
the
public,
now
the
only
thing
is
that
some
of
his
statements
were
actually
false
although
he
believed
them
to
be
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
rather
critical
here
isn't
it?
whether
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
new
york
times
applies
or
it
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
am
not
--
let's
put
the
e7
regulation
aside
for
the
moment.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
are
merely
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say
that
new
york
times
would
apply
to
this
case
why
this
–-
the
falsity
issues
goes
out,
because
there
has
been
no
finding
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
knowing
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth.
because
then
we
are
brought
back
wholly
to
the
e7.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
only
issue
that
remains
in
the
case
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
plus
make
a
false
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
remember
you
have
to
--
i
suppose
we
accept
the
finding
that
some
of
these
statements
were
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
do
you
have
to
have
some
excuse
for
--
you
have
to
have
some
justification
for
saying
that
people
should
not
be
disciplined
for
circulating
false
statement
about
an
institution
which
it
claims
the
public
should
have
truthful
information
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
a
person
have
advantage
of
the
new
york
times
principle
however
who
refuses
use
an
avenue
of
getting
at
truthful
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
gave
the
electorate
false
information.
justice
byron
