justice
thurgood

spitting
on
the
school

[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
leave
it
up
to
the
school
board
to
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
somebody
said
something
unfair
about
them,
it
does
doesn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
was
done
here,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
made
the
original
findings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
was
the
open
letter
addressed
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
did
it
complain
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
school
board.
but
the
school
board
decided
that
if
you
complain
publicly
about
us
then
you
are
immoral.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
immoral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
was
perfectly
moral
for
15
years,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
retained
for
15
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
become
immoral
until
he
talked
to
somebody
about
superintendent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
whose
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
position
that
when
you
accept
public
employment
you
give
up
some
of
your
constitutional
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
give
up
your
first
amendment
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
is
the
requirement
that
you
first
apply
to
the
school
board
before
you
apply
to
the
public
not
a
conditioning
of
your
first
amendment
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
that
not
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
talking
about
his
work,
we're
talking
about
this
letter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
done
at
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
that
not
interfere
with
the
employee's
right
to
speak
whenever
and
wherever
he
pleases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
believe
that
it's
wrong
for
the
state
to
limit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why,
if
it's
just
delaying
why
is
it
so
essential?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
understood
you
correctly
you
said
that
he
could
have
filed
this
letter
with
the
school
board
yesterday
and
go
out
take
it
to
the
public
today.
is
that
not
what
you
told
mr.
justice
white?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
didn't
you
say,
regardless
of
what
the
school
board
did
he
could
still
go
to
the
public
with
it,
if
he
first
gave
it
to
the
school
board?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
assuming
he
didn't
get
it
redressed
and
he
went
to
the
public,
do
you
say
that's
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
is
so
holy
about
going
to
the
school
board
if
eventually
he
can
go
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
--
well
if
it
is
brought
to
the
whole
public,
it's
brought
to
them
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
really
mean
is
that
you
expect
the
employee
to
keep
it
within
the
family.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
wrong
with
the
citizen
wanting
one
to
get
rid
of
a
superintendent
through
legal
process
and
getting
as
many
people
as
he
can
to
join
him
to
legally
get
rid
of
a
public
official?
what
in
the
world
is
wrong
or
immoral
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
is
that
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
not
necessarily
detrimental
i
submit
to
the
employer.
the
employer
is
the
city
of
seward
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
taxes
up
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
the
superintendent
is
not
the
employer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
natural
employer
is
the
man
who
has
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
whole
point
as
i
understand
it
is
and
i
repeat
and
if
i
am
wrong
you
tell
me,
both
of
these
people
set
out
to
find
every
lawful
means
possible
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
and
to
correct
what
they
considered
to
be
inadequacies
in
the
board
and
in
order
to
do
that
they
chose
to
exercise
their
freedom
to
speak
and
write
and
for
doing
that
the
board
and
the
superintendent
decided
that
their
actions
are
wrong.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
that
due
process
that
party
involved
should
decide
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
in
that
letter
that
didn't
apply
to
either
the
school
board
or
the
superintendent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
i
don't
i
think
understand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
the
teacher
writes
an
open
letter
to
get
rid
of
the
governor
would
that
be
immoral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
could
he
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
would
i
be
correct
in
assuming
that
the
teacher
could
circulate
a
letter
with
the
truthful
statements
and
statement
he
thought
to
be
true,
call
in
for
the
removal
of
anybody
else
except
the
superintendent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
am
correct.
that
you
can
circulate
a
letter
and
calling
for
the
removal
of
any
other
public
official
other
than
the
superintendent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
done
at
home
at
midnight.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
not
be
immoral.
it
only
becomes
immoral
when
you
write
about
the
