mr.
george
n.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
by
point
one,
point
i
think
on
which
mr.
kaufmann
and
i
agreed
and
that
is
that
we
agree
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
defined
immorality
under
its
non
retention
statute
as
so
called
catch-all
for
conduct
or
as
a
broad
form
statute.
now,
perhaps
the
terminology
of
this
statute
is
little
unfortunate,
but
it
reads
as
follows.
these
are
the
grounds
for
the
non-retention.
the
second
cause
immorality
which
is
defined
as
conduct
of
the
person
tending
to
bring
the
individual
concerned
or
the
teaching
profession
into
public
disgrace
or
disrespect.
now,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
that’s
a
catch-all
type
statute
such
as
the
statute
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreted
in
bylund,
they
interpreted
incompetency
to
cover
the
whole
range
of
conduct
which
is
grounds
for
barring
a
teacher
from
service.
it’s
like
the
good
of
the
service
test
or
the
good
moral
character
which
applies
in
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
if
they
had
so
defined
it
your
honor
that
wouldn’t
be
the
question,
but
i
think
my
point
my
here
is
that
mr.
kaufmann
agrees
that
they
have
done
this
and
this
is
binding
on
all
parties.
now
he
uses
it
in
his
over
breadth
argument,
now
we
feel
that
it
supports
us
because
it
upholds
--
it’s
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court’s
holding.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
might
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
would
depend,
no
particular
act
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
might
or
it
might
not
but
the
point
is
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
this
type
of
statute
where
there’s
a
broad
or
it
gives
a
broad
standard,
it
leaves
to
the
determination
of
the
administration
or
the
court
that’s
administering
and
applying
this
the
determination,
they
hold
a
hearing
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
they
might
do
this
and
this
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
there
was
much
more
than
that
done.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
seward
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
to
the
seward
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
complained
about
the
superintendent
and
the
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
they
decided
this
--
this
was
perhaps
--
you
cut
a
lot
out,
but
this
perhaps
one
finding.
[laughter]
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
the
only
cause
and
this
is
the
least
of
the
grounds
that
we
rely
on.
for
instance,
they
also
found
and
the
supreme
court
in
effect
independently
found,
our
supreme
court,
independently
found
that
mr.
watts
during
school
hours
solicited
another
teacher,
two
other
teachers
to
join
him
in
a
movement
to
oust
the
superintendent.
now,
this
is
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it’s
under
this
broad
catch-all
definition,
its
conduct
that
is
not
compatible
with
the
position
of
mr.
watts
as
a
teacher,
as
an
employee.
we
submit
your
honor,
this
is
basic
to
the
employer-employee
relationship
and
when
you
have
state
as
employer,
you
have
to
apply
a
slightly
different
standard,
it’s
basic
to
this
that
the
employee
give
his
loyalty
to
his
employer.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
he
can’t
criticize
employer,
he
can
in
certain
circumstances,
but
it's
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
hold
that
an
employee
during
working
time
solicits
his
fellow
employees
to
get
rid
of
the
employer,
is
a
competent
or
moral
employee
or
that
he
is
entitled
to
further
service,
it's
as
if
a
(inaudible).
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know,
i
mean
nothing
had
come
up.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
he
was
retained
for
15
years.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
actually
that's
the
unfortunate
aspect
of
this
word
immoral
but
as
it's
been
defined
by
statute
and
defined
by
the
alaska
supreme
court
it
doesn't
--
it
has
a
much
broader
meaning
and
i
think
it
has
a
very
acceptable
meaning,
it's
in
the
same
line
with
good
cause
or
the
good
of
service
this
kind
of
thing.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
that's
not
the
way
it
should
be
applied.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
it's
applied
as
if
it--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
right
sometimes
they
may
and
sometimes
may
not
and
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
in
whose
judgment,
initially
the
school
board
subject
to
review
by
state
board
of
education,
subject
to
view
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court.
it's
a
situation
such
as
in
--
well
let's
say
a
bar
of
lawyers
admission
case
like
schware
or
(inaudible).
now
here
you
have
a
standard,
the
person
has
got
to
be
of
good
moral
conduct,
a
good
moral
character
and
in
some
cases
this
court
finds
that
--
well
in
many
states
it's
the
bar
association
that
conducts
initial
investigation
and
hearing
and
if
they
--
and
on
the
facts
as
presented
to
them,
they
find
whether
certain
facts
would
constitute
good
character,
now
this
is
subject
to
review,
all
the
way
to
this
court
in
appropriate
cases.
and
this
court
may
find
as
it
did
in
schware
that
the
conduct
of
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
new
mexico
bar
which
had
been
found
to
be
immoral,
in
effect,
it
was
a
poor
character
could
not
stand.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
we
got
to
separate
out
three
distinct
things
here
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
--
one
issue
and
this
is
the
one
that
mr.
kaufmann
has
stressed
is
the
circulation
of
a
false
--
of
a
letter
to
the
school
board
and
the
public
which
contained
false
statement.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
but
that
ground
would
then
be
dropped,
then
we'll
be
back
to
just
the
other
two
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
one
is
that
it
violates
a
reasonable
legitimate
regulation
of
the
school
board
which
is
in
fact
a
grievance
procedure
which
says
you
got
to
submit
your
complaints
first
to
the
superintendent
and
then
to
the
school
board.
and
incidentally
on
that
point--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
and
the
other
one
is
the
–-
it
applies
just
to
mr.
watts
and
that
was
his
solicitation
of
other
teachers
during
school
hours
to
join
him
in
a
plot
or
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
in
which
the
alaska
supreme
court
upheld
as
grounds
for
firing
mr.
watts,
said
it
didn't
apply
to
mr.
blue,
just
mr.
watts
that
one.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
just
mr.
watts
yes.
now
on
this
regulation
the
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
correct,
correct.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
it
would
apply
to
the
e7
regulation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
the
standard
might
or
it
might
not,
it
would
just
be
a
question
of
whether
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
on
that
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
if
you
are
just
talking
about
the
letter
mr.
justice
white,
if
you
are
just
talking
about
the
letter,
but
if
you
are
talking
the
e7
regulation
then
i
don't
think
it
applies
at
all.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
that
there
maybe
a
difference
and
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
interest
of
the
state
involved
and
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
as
an
employer
is
higher
and
more
important
than
the
interest
of
the
state
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
merely
calling
it
liable.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
i
understand
and
i
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
with
respect
to
mr.
blue,
not
with
respect
to
mr.
watts.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
that,
you
know,
i'd
only
this
on
that
point,
is
i
feel
these
are
the
points
that
are
stronger
and
i
prefer
to
argue
them.
but
i
can
say
only
this
that
where
you
have
an
employer,
the
state
as
an
employer
i
think
is
a
higher
interest
and
more
important
interest
than
the
state
regulating
liable
or
regulating
conduct
on
election
day
such
as
in
mills
v.
alabama
where
they
held
that
editorial
could
not
be
proscribed
on
election
day.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
but
with
respect
to
this
regulation
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
your
honor
that's
no
longer
permissible.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
you'd
not
give
them
but
you
do
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
believe
its
reasonable
and
its
reasonable
because
one
of
the
most
important
things
about
an
employment
relationship,
perhaps
the
next
most
important
thing
to
having
an
employee
who
doesn't
try
to
knife
you
while
he
is
at
work,
is
to
have
a
grievance
procedure.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
but
i
am
saying
the
second
most
important
thing
is
to
have
a
grievance
procedure
that
permits
the
employer
to
find
out
what
the
grievances
are
and
to
work
them
out
with
the
employees
before
they
are
made
public
or
taken
higher
up.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
suppose
it
does.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
not,
not
to
that
extent.
it's
only
a
delaying,
at
the
most
it's
only
a
delaying
of
the
right
to
speak
and
its
saying,
first
you
have
got
to
let
us
know
what
the
problem
is.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
because
it
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
i
don't
think
those
are
my
words.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
if
he
didn't
get
redressed,
presumably
if
he
got
it
redressed
he
wouldn't
have
any
reason
to
go
to
the
public.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
yes,
after
he's
complied
with
the
regulation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
because
it
permits
them
--
it
permits
the
employer,
the
school
system
to
know
what
the
problems
are
that
are
brought
to
their
attention
and
they
can
work
them
out.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
initially.
otherwise
it's
too
disruptive
of
the
--
i
mean
look
what
the
situation
was
here.
all
of
the
open
letters
speaks
about
this
disruption.
the
witnesses
speak
about
it,
they
say
the
whole
town
was
in
turmoil,
now
there
maybe
some
disagreement
about
what
caused
this,
but
it
did
exist
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
reason
for
this
was
the
manner
in
which
mr.
watts
and
mr.
blue
are
going
about
this.
it's
not
true,
well,
first
of
all
they
knew
that
they
had
to
submit
these
--
that
they
were
supposed
to
under
the
regulation
submit
these
to
the
superintendent
and
the
school
board.
they
didn't
claim
that
they
didn't
know
this.
they
know
this,
they
read
the
regulations
and
they
understood
it.
they
claimed
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
couldn't
get
anywhere.
but
the
record
shows
that
they
had,
had
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks
before
they
had,
had
a
grievance
and
this
was
that
the
superintendent
had
said
you
got
to
get
certain
additional
teaching
credit
hours.
and
mr.
watts
felt
he
ought
to
have
another
year
in
which
he
could
do
it.
the
superintendent
said
“no,”
and
he
said,
“i'd
like
to
take
it
to
the
school
board,”
superintendent
said
“go
ahead
we've
talk
it
over
and
you
have
failed.”
he
took
it
to
the
school
board
and
the
school
board
granted
him
a
year's
extension.
the
school
board
contrary
to
what's
been
said
the
school
board
just
prior
to
this
open
letter
had
not
refused
to
meet
with
him,
they
had
only
said
that
we
want
to
defer
this
meeting
until
we
have
our
lawyer
present
because
at
the
previous
meeting,
the
teachers
had
had
a
lawyer
there
and
it
was
at
that
meeting
that
they
had
conceded
that
they
were
wrong
and
hired
back
four
teachers
and
the
finding
here
is
mr.
watts
told
the
frampton's
fellow
teachers
that
i
am
part
of
a
group
that's
out
to
get
the
superintendent.
they
didn't
want
to
present
grievances,
they
didn't
want
them
processed,
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
and
i
think
that
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
case
of
a
letter
going
to
the
public.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
wrong
part
about
it
is
using
his
employer's
time
to
do
it
on.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
the
principle
objection
yes
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
false
statements
yes,
but
he
was
just
closing
the
--
he
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
included
in
mr.
justice
marshall's
hypothetical.
but
this
is
--
i
think
this
is
proved
in
the
hatch
act
case,
in
the
--
this
name
escapes
me
now,
united
public
workers
the
hatch
act
applied
only
after
our
activities
and
it's
assumed
--
the
opinion
as
i
recall
is
a
position
in
place
of
the
courts
as
well,
of
course
political
activities
on
the
job
they
are
not
tolerated
anyway
with
or
without
a
statute.
this
just
regulated
conduct
off
the
job,
i
think
this
is
pretty
axiomatic.
you
don't
engage
in
conduct
which
maybe
detrimental
to
your
employer
on
the
job.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
employer
technically
i
think
is
the
seward
school
board,
that
was
the
contract.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes
rather
heavy.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
he
--
it
depends
on
how
you
define
an
employer,
was
that
the
man
that
pays
the
money
or
is
it
man
that
controls
the
work?
now
he
is
the
employer
in
a
sense
that
he
controls
the
work
and
the
operation
of
the
school.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
it's
both.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
would
not
so
state
it.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i'd
like
to,
if
i
might
on
this.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
on
this
other
point
you
say
that
isn't
--
not
due
process
to
have
the
same
board
decide
--
have
the
employer
in
fact
decide
initially
what
the
facts
are,
i
submit
that
it's
not,
this
is
--
it
may
depend
on
the
type
of
review
you
have,
but
here
you
have,
in
effect
you
have
a
de
novo
review
by
the
alaska
supreme
court,
they
ordered
to
hold
record.
they
made
in
effect
revised
findings,
they
completely
and
thoroughly
went
through
the
whole
thing
and
i
submit
that
that's
--
if
there
was
an
issue
and
i
say
it
is
not,
it
hasn't
been
raised
in
this
case,
it
hasn't
in
the
following
a
case,
(inaudible)
case,
but
if
it
had
been
that's
not
the
case,
there
are
adequate
safeguards
here
and
it's
not
in
the
case.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
regulations
are
--
the
pertinent
portions
are
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
page
14
a
and
15
a
of
the
--
of
his
opening
brief.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
don't
believe
it
does
your
honor,
it
says
--
what
it
does
say
is
that
they
must
go
to
and
through
the
superintendent
and
this
is
what
they
fail
to
do.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
but
if
they
do
go
to
the
board
and
that's
what
they
did
here
they
preferred
to
go
to
the
board,
they've
got
to
go
to
and
through
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
correct.
and
this
is
what
they
didn't
do
here,
they
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
to
petition
the
government?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
but
they
as
teachers,
they
are
in
a
position
of
being
teachers
and
the
only
limitation
here
is
and
we
submit
it's
a
reasonable
one,
is
that
when
they
do
petition
for
redress,
a
matter
involving
the
superintendent
which
most
of
these
things
did,
that
they
go
to
the
--
they
petition
the
board
to
and
through
the
superintendent
and
i
only
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable
regulation
and
it's
the
same
kind
of
basic
thing
as
the
situation
of
mr.
watts
in
--
during
school
time
using
school
time
and
school
premises
to
solicit
others
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
this
is
conduct
that
just
can't
be
condoned.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
on
which
on
--?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
there
is
no
special
regulation,
this
comes
under
this
catch-all
provision
which
the
supreme
court
found
that
the
conduct
which
was
immoral
under
the
statute
or
which
under
another
statue
might
be
called
incompetence
or
whatever
it
is.
it
was
under
that
section,
under
that
provision
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
retaining
mr.
watts.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
dividing
line
is
where
the
teacher
adopts
the
announced
purpose
of
trying
to
get
others
to
join
a
movement
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
things
that,
that
he
is
bound
to
know
that
he
is
not
permissible
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
state
and
an
employer
situation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
but
this
is
the
situation
where
you
are
applying
a
standard
like
good
of
the
service
or
for
good
cause.
there
isn't
always
--
it's
not
spelled
out,
but
when
the
court
finds
that
something
is
good
cause,
it
isn't
necessarily
warning
of
it,
there
is
a
--
it's
a
finding
by
the
body
that's
adjudicating
this,
that
it's
a
kind
of
thing
that
he
should
have
known.
for
instance,
well,
i'd
rather
not
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
an
open
letter
to
what,
to
the
public?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
provided
--
i
mean
if
it
contain
--
unless
we
are
presuming
that
it
contained
truthful
statements.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
the
superintendent
isn't
removed
by
election,
i
mean
that's
--
he
is
appointed
by
the
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
if
you
don't
--
well
let
me
limit
this
--
certainly
if
you
do
it
on
school
time
among
your
teachers
this
would
not
be
proper.
now
it
might
be
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
would
have
no
objection
with
it.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
did
not
limit
that
to
--
i
mean
i
think
you
could
do
this
on
the
superintendent,
provided
i
mean
--
but
that's
not
the
issue
here
because
the
question
here
is,
see
that's
not
what's
involved,
what's
involved
is
first
doing
it
on
school
time,
in
this
case
of
mr.
watts,
the
second
place
with
respect
to
both
of
them
it's
doing
it
in
violation
of
a
regulation,
a
reasonable
regulation
which
says
they
have
to
got
to
submit
any
grievances
they
have
first
to
the
superintendent.
if
they
submit
them
to
the
board
and
they
didn't
choose
that
route,
they
addressed
it
to
the
board
and
they
were
purportedly,
they
were
trying
to
get
redress
with
these
grievances
and
they
didn't
follow
the
procedure,
i
mean
it's
as
sample
as
that.
if
i
may
just
make
--
i
have
just
a
few
minutes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
where
you
have
this
regulation,
yes
sir
and
that's
the
situation
here,
they
did
that.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
or
certain
actions
of
the
superintendent,
they
were
complaining
about
actions
of
the
superintendent.
for
instance,
that
he
hadn't
held
enough
fire
drills
which
he
admitted
it
was
true,
but
it
wasn't
brought
to
his
attention
first,
they
just
took
it
directly
to
the
school
board.
now
i
submit
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
he
had
a
right
to
know
and
remedy,
perhaps
he
didn't
know
that
he
hadn't
had
enough.
i
mean
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
and
that's
why
this
is
reasonable.
but
on
this
question
of
the
arguments
been
made
on
the
question
of
over
breadth,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
these
are
statutes
and
the
statute
regulations
have
been
attacked
on
the
grounds
over
breadth.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
applicable
to
this
type
of
statute.
it's
applicable
to
the
type
of
statute
that
says
if
you're
a
member,
the
communist
party
you
can't
be
employed
by
the
state,
these
have
been
struck
down
on
grounds
that
the
decision
of
whether
being
a
member
of
communist
party
is
good
or
bad
has
been
made
by
the
legislator
without
any
subjective
investigation
so
that
all
that's
left
to
the
administrative
party
in
applying
this
standard
is
was
he
or
was
he
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
did
he
or
did
he
not
do
this
particular
conduct
and
if
in
fact
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
all
cases
is
not
grounds
for
disbarment
or
whatever
then
it's
no
good.
and
that's
where
the
overbroad
argument
applies
but
where
you
have
a
catch-all
type
of
statute
or
regulation
as
we
do
here
and
where
the
determination
of
adjudicating
board
is
to
consider
all
the
facts
and
then
determine
subject
to
review
whether
certain
acts
fall
in
the
definition
of
prescribed
conduct,
it's
a
different
situation
and
in
fact
this
is
a
kind
of
the
statute
you
have
with
the
bar
statutes
on
schware
and
(inaudible)
where
they
say
a
good
moral
character
and
these
cases,
these
denials
of
admission
have
been
overturned
by
this
court
and
if
the
statute
stands
because
the
standard
is
all
right
it's
just
in
that
particular
case
it
wasn't
applied
right.
it's
a
broad
standard
and
the
bar
association
has
the
job
of
determining
if
it
applies
in
this
particular
case
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here
with
the
alaska
supreme
court
by
the
standard
that
it
did
apply.
but
even
though
they
said
in
certain
cases
it's
unconstitutional
as
application,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
said
this
how
--
that
doesn't
mean
the
whole
statute
is
bad
because
any
statute
is
the
words,
the
power
of
contempt
of
a
court
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
many
instances
to
have
exceeded
the
constitutional
limits
is
nevertheless
still
there,
it
isn't
destroyed
because
in
some
circumstances
it
can
be
unconstitutionally
applied.
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
by
point
one,
point
i
think
on
which
mr.
kaufmann
and
i
agreed
and
that
is
that
we
agree
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
defined
immorality
under
its
non
retention
statute
as
so
called
catch-all
for
conduct
or
as
a
broad
form
statute.
now,
perhaps
the
terminology
of
this
statute
is
little
unfortunate,
but
it
reads
as
follows.
these
are
the
grounds
for
the
non-retention.
the
second
cause
immorality
which
is
defined
as
conduct
of
the
person
tending
to
bring
the
individual
concerned
or
the
teaching
profession
into
public
disgrace
or
disrespect.
now,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
that’s
a
catch-all
type
statute
such
as
the
statute
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreted
in
bylund,
they
interpreted
incompetency
to
cover
the
whole
range
of
conduct
which
is
grounds
for
barring
a
teacher
from
service.
it’s
like
the
good
of
the
service
test
or
the
good
moral
character
which
applies
in
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
if
they
had
so
defined
it
your
honor
that
wouldn’t
be
the
question,
but
i
think
my
point
my
here
is
that
mr.
kaufmann
agrees
that
they
have
done
this
and
this
is
binding
on
all
parties.
now
he
uses
it
in
his
over
breadth
argument,
now
we
feel
that
it
supports
us
because
it
upholds
--
it’s
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court’s
holding.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
might
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
would
depend,
no
particular
act
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
might
or
it
might
not
but
the
point
is
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
this
type
of
statute
where
there’s
a
broad
or
it
gives
a
broad
standard,
it
leaves
to
the
determination
of
the
administration
or
the
court
that’s
administering
and
applying
this
the
determination,
they
hold
a
hearing
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
they
might
do
this
and
this
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
there
was
much
more
than
that
done.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
seward
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
to
the
seward
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
complained
about
the
superintendent
and
the
school
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
they
decided
this
--
this
was
perhaps
--
you
cut
a
lot
out,
but
this
perhaps
one
finding.
[laughter]
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
the
only
cause
and
this
is
the
least
of
the
grounds
that
we
rely
on.
for
instance,
they
also
found
and
the
supreme
court
in
effect
independently
found,
our
supreme
court,
independently
found
that
mr.
watts
during
school
hours
solicited
another
teacher,
two
other
teachers
to
join
him
in
a
movement
to
oust
the
superintendent.
now,
this
is
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it’s
under
this
broad
catch-all
definition,
its
conduct
that
is
not
compatible
with
the
position
of
mr.
watts
as
a
teacher,
as
an
employee.
we
submit
your
honor,
this
is
basic
to
the
employer-employee
relationship
and
when
you
have
state
as
employer,
you
have
to
apply
a
slightly
different
standard,
it’s
basic
to
this
that
the
employee
give
his
loyalty
to
his
employer.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
he
can’t
criticize
employer,
he
can
in
certain
circumstances,
but
it's
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
hold
that
an
employee
during
working
time
solicits
his
fellow
employees
to
get
rid
of
the
employer,
is
a
competent
or
moral
employee
or
that
he
is
entitled
to
further
service,
it's
as
if
a
(inaudible).
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know,
i
mean
nothing
had
come
up.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
he
was
retained
for
15
years.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
actually
that's
the
unfortunate
aspect
of
this
word
immoral
but
as
it's
been
defined
by
statute
and
defined
by
the
alaska
supreme
court
it
doesn't
--
it
has
a
much
broader
meaning
and
i
think
it
has
a
very
acceptable
meaning,
it's
in
the
same
line
with
good
cause
or
the
good
of
service
this
kind
of
thing.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
that's
not
the
way
it
should
be
applied.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
it's
applied
as
if
it--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
right
sometimes
they
may
and
sometimes
may
not
and
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
in
whose
judgment,
initially
the
school
board
subject
to
review
by
state
board
of
education,
subject
to
view
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court.
it's
a
situation
such
as
in
--
well
let's
say
a
bar
of
lawyers
admission
case
like
schware
or
(inaudible).
now
here
you
have
a
standard,
the
person
has
got
to
be
of
good
moral
conduct,
a
good
moral
character
and
in
some
cases
this
court
finds
that
--
well
in
many
states
it's
the
bar
association
that
conducts
initial
investigation
and
hearing
and
if
they
--
and
on
the
facts
as
presented
to
them,
they
find
whether
certain
facts
would
constitute
good
character,
now
this
is
subject
to
review,
all
the
way
to
this
court
in
appropriate
cases.
and
this
court
may
find
as
it
did
in
schware
that
the
conduct
of
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
new
mexico
bar
which
had
been
found
to
be
immoral,
in
effect,
it
was
a
poor
character
could
not
stand.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
we
got
to
separate
out
three
distinct
things
here
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
--
one
issue
and
this
is
the
one
that
mr.
kaufmann
has
stressed
is
the
circulation
of
a
false
--
of
a
letter
to
the
school
board
and
the
public
which
contained
false
statement.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
but
that
ground
would
then
be
dropped,
then
we'll
be
back
to
just
the
other
two
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
one
is
that
it
violates
a
reasonable
legitimate
regulation
of
the
school
board
which
is
in
fact
a
grievance
procedure
which
says
you
got
to
submit
your
complaints
first
to
the
superintendent
and
then
to
the
school
board.
and
incidentally
on
that
point--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
and
the
other
one
is
the
–-
it
applies
just
to
mr.
watts
and
that
was
his
solicitation
of
other
teachers
during
school
hours
to
join
him
in
a
plot
or
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
in
which
the
alaska
supreme
court
upheld
as
grounds
for
firing
mr.
watts,
said
it
didn't
apply
to
mr.
blue,
just
mr.
watts
that
one.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
just
mr.
watts
yes.
now
on
this
regulation
the
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
correct,
correct.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
it
would
apply
to
the
e7
regulation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
the
standard
might
or
it
might
not,
it
would
just
be
a
question
of
whether
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
on
that
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
if
you
are
just
talking
about
the
letter
mr.
justice
white,
if
you
are
just
talking
about
the
letter,
but
if
you
are
talking
the
e7
regulation
then
i
don't
think
it
applies
at
all.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
that
there
maybe
a
difference
and
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
interest
of
the
state
involved
and
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
as
an
employer
is
higher
and
more
important
than
the
interest
of
the
state
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
merely
calling
it
liable.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
i
understand
and
i
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
with
respect
to
mr.
blue,
not
with
respect
to
mr.
watts.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
that,
you
know,
i'd
only
this
on
that
point,
is
i
feel
these
are
the
points
that
are
stronger
and
i
prefer
to
argue
them.
but
i
can
say
only
this
that
where
you
have
an
employer,
the
state
as
an
employer
i
think
is
a
higher
interest
and
more
important
interest
than
the
state
regulating
liable
or
regulating
conduct
on
election
day
such
as
in
mills
v.
alabama
where
they
held
that
editorial
could
not
be
proscribed
on
election
day.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
but
with
respect
to
this
regulation
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
your
honor
that's
no
longer
permissible.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
you'd
not
give
them
but
you
do
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
believe
its
reasonable
and
its
reasonable
because
one
of
the
most
important
things
about
an
employment
relationship,
perhaps
the
next
most
important
thing
to
having
an
employee
who
doesn't
try
to
knife
you
while
he
is
at
work,
is
to
have
a
grievance
procedure.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
but
i
am
saying
the
second
most
important
thing
is
to
have
a
grievance
procedure
that
permits
the
employer
to
find
out
what
the
grievances
are
and
to
work
them
out
with
the
employees
before
they
are
made
public
or
taken
higher
up.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
suppose
it
does.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
not,
not
to
that
extent.
it's
only
a
delaying,
at
the
most
it's
only
a
delaying
of
the
right
to
speak
and
its
saying,
first
you
have
got
to
let
us
know
what
the
problem
is.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
because
it
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no
i
don't
think
those
are
my
words.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
if
he
didn't
get
redressed,
presumably
if
he
got
it
redressed
he
wouldn't
have
any
reason
to
go
to
the
public.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
yes,
after
he's
complied
with
the
regulation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
because
it
permits
them
--
it
permits
the
employer,
the
school
system
to
know
what
the
problems
are
that
are
brought
to
their
attention
and
they
can
work
them
out.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
initially.
otherwise
it's
too
disruptive
of
the
--
i
mean
look
what
the
situation
was
here.
all
of
the
open
letters
speaks
about
this
disruption.
the
witnesses
speak
about
it,
they
say
the
whole
town
was
in
turmoil,
now
there
maybe
some
disagreement
about
what
caused
this,
but
it
did
exist
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
reason
for
this
was
the
manner
in
which
mr.
watts
and
mr.
blue
are
going
about
this.
it's
not
true,
well,
first
of
all
they
knew
that
they
had
to
submit
these
--
that
they
were
supposed
to
under
the
regulation
submit
these
to
the
superintendent
and
the
school
board.
they
didn't
claim
that
they
didn't
know
this.
they
know
this,
they
read
the
regulations
and
they
understood
it.
they
claimed
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
couldn't
get
anywhere.
but
the
record
shows
that
they
had,
had
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks
before
they
had,
had
a
grievance
and
this
was
that
the
superintendent
had
said
you
got
to
get
certain
additional
teaching
credit
hours.
and
mr.
watts
felt
he
ought
to
have
another
year
in
which
he
could
do
it.
the
superintendent
said
“no,”
and
he
said,
“i'd
like
to
take
it
to
the
school
board,”
superintendent
said
“go
ahead
we've
talk
it
over
and
you
have
failed.”
he
took
it
to
the
school
board
and
the
school
board
granted
him
a
year's
extension.
the
school
board
contrary
to
what's
been
said
the
school
board
just
prior
to
this
open
letter
had
not
refused
to
meet
with
him,
they
had
only
said
that
we
want
to
defer
this
meeting
until
we
have
our
lawyer
present
because
at
the
previous
meeting,
the
teachers
had
had
a
lawyer
there
and
it
was
at
that
meeting
that
they
had
conceded
that
they
were
wrong
and
hired
back
four
teachers
and
the
finding
here
is
mr.
watts
told
the
frampton's
fellow
teachers
that
i
am
part
of
a
group
that's
out
to
get
the
superintendent.
they
didn't
want
to
present
grievances,
they
didn't
want
them
processed,
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
and
i
think
that
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
case
of
a
letter
going
to
the
public.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
wrong
part
about
it
is
using
his
employer's
time
to
do
it
on.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
the
principle
objection
yes
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
false
statements
yes,
but
he
was
just
closing
the
--
he
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
included
in
mr.
justice
marshall's
hypothetical.
but
this
is
--
i
think
this
is
proved
in
the
hatch
act
case,
in
the
--
this
name
escapes
me
now,
united
public
workers
the
hatch
act
applied
only
after
our
activities
and
it's
assumed
--
the
opinion
as
i
recall
is
a
position
in
place
of
the
courts
as
well,
of
course
political
activities
on
the
job
they
are
not
tolerated
anyway
with
or
without
a
statute.
this
just
regulated
conduct
off
the
job,
i
think
this
is
pretty
axiomatic.
you
don't
engage
in
conduct
which
maybe
detrimental
to
your
employer
on
the
job.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
employer
technically
i
think
is
the
seward
school
board,
that
was
the
contract.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes
rather
heavy.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
he
--
it
depends
on
how
you
define
an
employer,
was
that
the
man
that
pays
the
money
or
is
it
man
that
controls
the
work?
now
he
is
the
employer
in
a
sense
that
he
controls
the
work
and
the
operation
of
the
school.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
it's
both.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
would
not
so
state
it.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i'd
like
to,
if
i
might
on
this.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
on
this
other
point
you
say
that
isn't
--
not
due
process
to
have
the
same
board
decide
--
have
the
employer
in
fact
decide
initially
what
the
facts
are,
i
submit
that
it's
not,
this
is
--
it
may
depend
on
the
type
of
review
you
have,
but
here
you
have,
in
effect
you
have
a
de
novo
review
by
the
alaska
supreme
court,
they
ordered
to
hold
record.
they
made
in
effect
revised
findings,
they
completely
and
thoroughly
went
through
the
whole
thing
and
i
submit
that
that's
--
if
there
was
an
issue
and
i
say
it
is
not,
it
hasn't
been
raised
in
this
case,
it
hasn't
in
the
following
a
case,
(inaudible)
case,
but
if
it
had
been
that's
not
the
case,
there
are
adequate
safeguards
here
and
it's
not
in
the
case.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
regulations
are
--
the
pertinent
portions
are
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
page
14
a
and
15
a
of
the
--
of
his
opening
brief.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
don't
believe
it
does
your
honor,
it
says
--
what
it
does
say
is
that
they
must
go
to
and
through
the
superintendent
and
this
is
what
they
fail
to
do.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
but
if
they
do
go
to
the
board
and
that's
what
they
did
here
they
preferred
to
go
to
the
board,
they've
got
to
go
to
and
through
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
correct.
and
this
is
what
they
didn't
do
here,
they
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
to
petition
the
government?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
but
they
as
teachers,
they
are
in
a
position
of
being
teachers
and
the
only
limitation
here
is
and
we
submit
it's
a
reasonable
one,
is
that
when
they
do
petition
for
redress,
a
matter
involving
the
superintendent
which
most
of
these
things
did,
that
they
go
to
the
--
they
petition
the
board
to
and
through
the
superintendent
and
i
only
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable
regulation
and
it's
the
same
kind
of
basic
thing
as
the
situation
of
mr.
watts
in
--
during
school
time
using
school
time
and
school
premises
to
solicit
others
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
this
is
conduct
that
just
can't
be
condoned.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
on
which
on
--?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
there
is
no
special
regulation,
this
comes
under
this
catch-all
provision
which
the
supreme
court
found
that
the
conduct
which
was
immoral
under
the
statute
or
which
under
another
statue
might
be
called
incompetence
or
whatever
it
is.
it
was
under
that
section,
under
that
provision
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
retaining
mr.
watts.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
dividing
line
is
where
the
teacher
adopts
the
announced
purpose
of
trying
to
get
others
to
join
a
movement
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
things
that,
that
he
is
bound
to
know
that
he
is
not
permissible
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
state
and
an
employer
situation.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
but
this
is
the
situation
where
you
are
applying
a
standard
like
good
of
the
service
or
for
good
cause.
there
isn't
always
--
it's
not
spelled
out,
but
when
the
court
finds
that
something
is
good
cause,
it
isn't
necessarily
warning
of
it,
there
is
a
--
it's
a
finding
by
the
body
that's
adjudicating
this,
that
it's
a
kind
of
thing
that
he
should
have
known.
for
instance,
well,
i'd
rather
not
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
an
open
letter
to
what,
to
the
public?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
provided
--
i
mean
if
it
contain
--
unless
we
are
presuming
that
it
contained
truthful
statements.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
the
superintendent
isn't
removed
by
election,
i
mean
that's
--
he
is
appointed
by
the
board.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
if
you
don't
--
well
let
me
limit
this
--
certainly
if
you
do
it
on
school
time
among
your
teachers
this
would
not
be
proper.
now
it
might
be
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
would
have
no
objection
with
it.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
did
not
limit
that
to
--
i
mean
i
think
you
could
do
this
on
the
superintendent,
provided
i
mean
--
but
that's
not
the
issue
here
because
the
question
here
is,
see
that's
not
what's
involved,
what's
involved
is
first
doing
it
on
school
time,
in
this
case
of
mr.
watts,
the
second
place
with
respect
to
both
of
them
it's
doing
it
in
violation
of
a
regulation,
a
reasonable
regulation
which
says
they
have
to
got
to
submit
any
grievances
they
have
first
to
the
superintendent.
if
they
submit
them
to
the
board
and
they
didn't
choose
that
route,
they
addressed
it
to
the
board
and
they
were
purportedly,
they
were
trying
to
get
redress
with
these
grievances
and
they
didn't
follow
the
procedure,
i
mean
it's
as
sample
as
that.
if
i
may
just
make
--
i
have
just
a
few
minutes.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
where
you
have
this
regulation,
yes
sir
and
that's
the
situation
here,
they
did
that.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
or
certain
actions
of
the
superintendent,
they
were
complaining
about
actions
of
the
superintendent.
for
instance,
that
he
hadn't
held
enough
fire
drills
which
he
admitted
it
was
true,
but
it
wasn't
brought
to
his
attention
first,
they
just
took
it
directly
to
the
school
board.
now
i
submit
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
he
had
a
right
to
know
and
remedy,
perhaps
he
didn't
know
that
he
hadn't
had
enough.
i
mean
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
and
that's
why
this
is
reasonable.
but
on
this
question
of
the
arguments
been
made
on
the
question
of
over
breadth,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
these
are
statutes
and
the
statute
regulations
have
been
attacked
on
the
grounds
over
breadth.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
applicable
to
this
type
of
statute.
it's
applicable
to
the
type
of
statute
that
says
if
you're
a
member,
the
communist
party
you
can't
be
employed
by
the
state,
these
have
been
struck
down
on
grounds
that
the
decision
of
whether
being
a
member
of
communist
party
is
good
or
bad
has
been
made
by
the
legislator
without
any
subjective
investigation
so
that
all
that's
left
to
the
administrative
party
in
applying
this
standard
is
was
he
or
was
he
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
did
he
or
did
he
not
do
this
particular
conduct
and
if
in
fact
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
all
cases
is
not
grounds
for
disbarment
or
whatever
then
it's
no
good.
and
that's
where
the
overbroad
argument
applies
but
where
you
have
a
catch-all
type
of
statute
or
regulation
as
we
do
here
and
where
the
determination
of
adjudicating
board
is
to
consider
all
the
facts
and
then
determine
subject
to
review
whether
certain
acts
fall
in
the
definition
of
prescribed
conduct,
it's
a
different
situation
and
in
fact
this
is
a
kind
of
the
statute
you
have
with
the
bar
statutes
on
schware
and
(inaudible)
where
they
say
a
good
moral
character
and
these
cases,
these
denials
of
admission
have
been
overturned
by
this
court
and
if
the
statute
stands
because
the
standard
is
all
right
it's
just
in
that
particular
case
it
wasn't
applied
right.
it's
a
broad
standard
and
the
bar
association
has
the
job
of
determining
if
it
applies
in
this
particular
case
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here
with
the
alaska
supreme
court
by
the
standard
that
it
did
apply.
but
even
though
they
said
in
certain
cases
it's
unconstitutional
as
application,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
said
this
how
--
that
doesn't
mean
the
whole
statute
is
bad
because
any
statute
is
the
words,
the
power
of
contempt
of
a
court
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
many
instances
to
have
exceeded
the
constitutional
limits
is
nevertheless
still
there,
it
isn't
destroyed
because
in
some
circumstances
it
can
be
unconstitutionally
applied.
thank
you.
