mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
situation
where
15
employees
of
the
city
of
new
york
were
called
before
the
city
commissioner
of
investigation
who
is
not
a
prosecutor
in
anywhere
near
the
criminal
sense
or
in
any
sense.
the
commissioner
of
investigation
is
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york.
he
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
if
he
uncovers
any
case
of
criminal
wrongdoing,
he
must
turn
that
evidence
over
to
the
district
attorney
for
proper
criminal
prosecution.
fifteen
employees
were
questioned
by
their
employer
because
the
commissioner
of
investigation
is
a
commissioner
of
the
city
of
new
york.
they
were
question
concerning
specific
matters
relating
to
the
performance
of
their
duty,
an
allegation
coming
from
a
citizen
complaint
that
there
was
at
the
91st
pre-transfer
station,
a
conspiracy
which
was
costing
the
city
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
difficulty
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
hearings
you
see
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
are
not
part
of
this
--
are
not
part
of
this
record
and
it
is
not
--
that
point
is
relevant
of
course
in
terms
of
the
--
in
terms
of
the
question
of
the
wiretapping.
mr.
norman
redlich
but
the
--
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
the
citizen
complaint
was
or
was
not
the
source
of
the
wiretap,
that
would
be
going
beyond
the
record
but
the
fact
is
that
someone
complained
to
the
city.
mr.
norman
redlich
in
mr.
freidman's
affidavit
it
is
shown.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
it
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
he
would
have
it,
yes.
the
--
on
the
strength
of
this
information,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
called
these
people
and
asked
them
questions.
now,
in
light
of
yesterday's
discussion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
at
least
with
regard
to
these
12,
there
was
no
question
of
any
--
of
asking
them
to
waive
immunity.
they
were
asked
questions.
they
declined
to
answer
the
questions.
mr.
norman
redlich
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
they
were
then
suspended
and
formal
hearings
were
filed
against
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
--
as
we
have
interpreted
that
1123
in
light
of
slochower,
and
as
we
believe
that
interpretation
has
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
gardner,
we
do
not
dismiss
automatically.
we
hold
a
hearing
and
we
held
one
in
this
case.
a
hearing
was
held
in
which
the
12
employees
or
15
employees
were
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
why
they
have
pleaded
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
and
in
the
hearing
before
the
12,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
charges.
this
was
in
the
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
at
that
point
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
as
to
the
12,
that
was
the
end
of
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
there
was
still
another
proceeding.
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
nature
of
that
proceeding
was
that
they
were
charged
with
a
violation
of
1123.
they
were
asked
to
explain
their
plea
of
the
privilege
and
they
were
asked
if
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
charges.
their
position
was
that
they
stood
by
their
initial
position.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
new
york
court
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
not
affirmatively
stated
that
a
hearing
is
required
under
1123.
this
corporation
counsel,
this
city,
has
taken
the
position
that
a
dismissal
not
--
may
not
be
permitted.
either
under
1123
or
incidentally
under
that
section
which
is
before
you
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
(inaudible)
case
in
an
equivalent
statute.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
a
hearing
must
be
held
in
which
the
employee
is
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
plea
of
the
privilege
and
in
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
slochower.
it
is
our
position
that
what
slochower
precluded
was
an
automatic
inference
of
guilt
resulting
from
a
plea
of
the
privilege
and
that
these
employees
were
entitled
to
due
process,
due
process
requiring
a
separate
hearing
in
which
they
were
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
their
conduct
before
the
original
investigating
agency
and
in
which
in
the
case
of
these
12,
at
least
they
were
offered
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
charges.
mr.
norman
redlich
now,
they
were
asked
if
they
wish
to
--
if
they
wished
to
respond
to
the
--
the
initial
questions
were
asked
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond.
they
said,
they
stood
by
their
initial
position
which
was
a
refusal
to
answer
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
redlich
no.
we
--
mr.
norman
redlich
may
i
ask
you
to
restate
that
because
i
wanted
to
respond?
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
no,
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
read
slochower
as
saying
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
and
at
that
hearing
it
must
be
evident
that
the
questions
that
they
originally
refused
to
answer.
there
were
questions
which
were
directed
to
the
scope
of
their
work.
we
are
not
dealing
hear
with
a
situation
as
in
lerner,
brown
and
nelson
where
you
had
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
question
they
declined
to
answer
were
questions
which
related
to
the
employer-employee
relationship.
here,
there
were
questions
which
they
had
declined
to
answer
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
which
did
relate
very
narrowly
and
specifically
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
performing
the
job
which
they
were
hired
to
perform
for
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
and
we
as
--
mr.
norman
redlich
well
justice
clark's
opinion
talks
about
a
--
the
right
of
an
employer
to
inquire
into
the
employees
fitness
for
office.
and
what
we
have
here
when
the
commissioner
of
investigation
questioned
these
people,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was,
on
behalf
of
the
city,
as
a
city
commissioner
inquiring
in
our
judgment
precisely
into
that.
he
was
asking
these
questions
concerning
the
nature
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
performing
their
work.
a
transcript
of
that
hearing
was
then
presented
to
the
--
to
them
by
the
--
to
the
employees
at
the
commissioner
of
sanitations
hearing.
and
we
really
had
two
proceedings
in
which
the
employees
were
asked
one
questions
relating
to
their
work.
two,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
offer
any
explanations
to
why
they
had
declined
to
answer
and
they
were
perfectly
free
at
that
time
and
in
anytime
to
answer
questions
directly,
narrowly,
specifically
related
to
the
performance
of
their
work.
it
is
our
view
that
we
have
not
discharged
these
employees
out
of
any
automatic
inference
of
guilt.
as
employees,
they
have
an
obligation
to
reply
specifically
to
questions
relating
to
their
work
and
incidentally
as
this
court
has
held
as
we
interpret
in
garrity
and
we
believed
to
be
correct,
if
they
had
responded
to
any
questions
and
admitted
anything
which
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
case
or
the
fruits
of
it
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
case,
they
could
not
have
been
criminally
prosecuted.
taking
that
into
this
whole
picture,
it
is
our
judgment
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
redlich
corporation
counsel.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
said
corporation
counsel.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
slochower
is
in
1957.
mr.
norman
redlich
not
in
--
not
in
every
case.
i
think
the
position
which
was
involved
by
our
predecessors
in
office
was
that
a
hearing
was
necessary,
well,
necessary
is
too
strong.
that
in
--
in
most
cases
a
hearing
would
be
provided.
the
koepnick
case
which
is
referred
to
by
--
by
counsel,
is
a
case
which
i
think
is
peculiar
to
its
facts.
in
that,
it
was
apparent
from
that
case
that
that
a
hearing
would
serve
no
purpose
at
all
and
that
a
--
because
the
witness
was
claiming
there
that
there
was
absolutely
no
right
to
question
them
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
norman
redlich
not(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
not
to
my
knowledge
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
had
to
comment
on
that.
i
really
don't
think
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
not
been
since
slochower
an
automatic
type
of
dismissal.
we
have
a
section
called
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law.
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law
is
the
proceeding
whereby
a
person
is
charged
with
certain
conduct
which
is
a
basis
for
dismissal.
that
has
happened
since
the
slochower
case.
that
happened
in
all
of
these
cases.
these
dismissals
were
pursuant
to
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law.
the
question
is
that
--
the
issue
that
is
before
us
is
whether
at
that
hearing
in
section
75,
if
all
that
you
have
is
the
allegation
that
the
person
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
he
refuses
to
offer
any
explanation
of
it
making
be
dismissed.
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
can.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
in
all
cases,
in
the
matter
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
can
be
discharged
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
no,
because
we
do
believe
we
do
not
go
that
far.
we
believe
that
the
individual
should
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
wouldn't
state
that
the
--
i'm
not
convinced
that
the
federal
privilege
requires
in
light
of
garrity
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
hearing?
mr.
norman
redlich
i
think
that
the
--
in
light
of
the
--
my
answer,
in
light
of
garrity,
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
privilege
requires
it
because
i
think
that
any
evidence
that
is
adduced
here
could
not
be
used
in
any
criminal
proceeding.
i
think
due
process
may
require
it
and
i
think
due
process
might
preclude
us
as
it
may
have
precluded
the
examiners
in
spevack
from
ranging
into
a
--
ranging
out
to
a
scope
of
questions
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
nature
of
the
employee-employer
relationship.
mr.
norman
redlich
which
did
not
happen
here.
mr.
norman
redlich
no.
and
i
think
that
if
they
did
we
would
have
a
serious
due
process
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
only
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
other
part
is
that
if
an
employee
refuses
to
answer
a
question
narrowly
and
specifically
related
to
the
performance
of
this
work,
the
city
need
not
to
keep
that
person
on
the
payroll
indefinitely
so
that
he
can
retire
with
the
city
pension.
we
have
the
right
to
dismiss
it.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
city
even
needs
answers
to
the
questions
or
if
the
answer
doesn't
come
we
have
the
right
to
dismiss.
mr.
norman
redlich
your
honor,
the
history
of
this
charter
provision
has
been
indicated
yesterday.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
that,
however,
by
stating
that
if
any
employee
refused
to
decline
and
did
not
give
any
reason,
we
would
feel
that
we
would
have
a
right
to
dismiss
him
for
the
same
reason
that
we
dismissed
him
here
that
he
refused
to
answer
specific
questions
relating
to
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
norman
redlich
under
--
the
provision
under
which
they
were
--
they
were
discharged
pursuant
to
a
hearing
under
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law
regarding
the
--
under
which
the
city
employee
is
--
he
is
entitled
to
those
rights
and
entitled
to
judicial
review
from
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
would
say
two
things
in
response
to
that.
i
think
this
court
should
consider
these
cases
in
light
of
the
--
the
facts
before
it
namely,
the
hearing
in
all
cases.
and
secondly,
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
there
is
any
violation
of
the
privilege
at
all.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
these
employees
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
criminally
as
the
result
of
any
testimony
at
which
they
may
have
given
under
this
compulsion.
now,
this
is
--
as
a
result
of
the
holding
in
garrity,
i
think
that
this
court
might
well
consider
the
--
applying
a
situation
here
similar
to
what
you
had
in
murphy
against
waterfront
commission.
these
12
employees
may
well
have
been
or
these
15
employees
may
well
have
been
faced
with
the
--
with
what
in
their
mind
was
a
serious
danger
that
if
they
--
that
they
were
faced
with
--
between
the
rock
and
the
whirlpool.
in
fact,
we
feel
that
the
rock
no
longer
exists.
the
rock
has
certainly
not
existed
from
the
time
that
this
court's
decision
in
garrity
because
any
testimony
which
these
employees
would
give
under
these
circumstances,
they
would
not
be
used
nor
prove
any
of
the
fruits
of
that
testimony
be
used.
in
light
of
that
fact,
we
do
not
see
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
privilege.
the
privilege
does
not
protect
against
being
fired
if
you
refuse
to
answer.
the
privilege
does
protect
against
criminal
prosecution
and
we
believe
strongly
that
our
employees
are
entitled
to
and
should
receive
that
protection
and
that
is
why
we
welcome
the
decision
of
this
court
in
garrity.
mr.
norman
redlich
you
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
they
are
not
in
the
--
they
are
not
in
this
particular
record
because
the
hearing
took
place
after
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
your
honor.
the
purpose
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
charge
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation?
mr.
norman
redlich
it
was
a
charge
that
these
employees
had
violated
section
1123
of
the
charter.
and
at
that
hearing,
as
i
understand
it,
at
that
hearing
they
were
--
the
employees
were
presented
with
a
transcript
of
the
inquiry
which
had
been
conducted
previously
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
tape
to
--
no,
no
not
the
wiretapping,
no.
this
was
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
in
which
the
commissioner
of
investigation
asked
them
questions
concerning
this
alleged
conspiracy
and
they
declined
to
answer
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
now,
that
is
the
transcript
that
i'm
referring
to,
nothing
having
to
do
with
the
wiretap.
the
--
that
transcript
was
presented
to
the
employees
at
the
hearing
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
and
they
were
informed
that
they
would
be
in
charge
for
the
violation
of
section
1123.
they
were
asked
at
this
time
whether
they
wish
to
explain
their
plea
of
the
privilege
and
they
were
also
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
original
questions
to
the
15
were
about
the
allegation
that
they
had
taken
money
from
private
cartmen
and
pocketed
the
money
instead
of
picking
up
the
tickets
which
they
were
supposed
to
pick
up.
those
were
the
original
questions
posed
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
those
were
the
questions
which
we
feel
they
as
employees
should
have
answered,
they
didn't
answer.
now,
then
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
they
were
--
at
the
second
proceeding
although
the
formal
charge
against
them
was
a
violation
of
1123,
they
were
asked
as
i
understand
it
two
things
at
the
second
hearing
which
mr.
justice
white
refers
to.
they
were
asked
whether
they
had
any
explanation
for
their
refusal
to
testify
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
and
then
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
--
now,
to
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
them.
and
the
state
--
mr.
norman
redlich
you
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
ask
that
--
i've
answered
the
question
as
best
as
i
can,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
--
mr.
norman
redlich
could
i
respond
to
that?
the
reason
this
is
not
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
this
action
was
brought
to
enjoin
the
very
hearing
which
subsequently
took
place.
in
fact,
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case
came
down
prior
to
the
hearing.
the
district
court
decision
was
in
december
1966.
the
hearings
didn't
take
place
until
january,
so
we
have
an
incomplete
record
in
that
sense,
which
the
normal
procedure
challenging
this
type
of
proceeding
as
in
gardner
would
be
to
go
up
under
in
article
78.
mr.
norman
redlich
your
honor
i
--
mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice
the
formal
charge
levied
against
these
employees
was
that
they
had
violated
section
1123
of
the
charter.
in
that,
they
had
refused
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
to
respond
to
his
questions
relating
to
their
work.
mr.
norman
redlich
although
it
is
necessary
to
answer
that
to
go
beyond
the
record,
answering
it
to
the
best
of
my
information,
i
will.
mr.
norman
redlich
pardon?
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
i'm
answering
it
to
the
best
of
my
information
mr.
chief
justice
with
regard
to
the
12;
they
were
offered
that
opportunity
with
regard
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
original
questions
that
had
been
asked
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
with
regard
to
the
three,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
with
regard
to
the
12
who
had
pleaded
the
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
who
then
went
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
according
to
my
best
information
and
belief,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wished
now
to
answer
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
of
them
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation,
they
declined.
now,
with
regard
to
the
three
who
did
originally
answer
the
questions
and
then
went
before
the
grand
jury,
they
had
a
separate
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
the
next
day
after
the
12
--
i'm
sorry
they
went
for
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
the
next
day
after
the
12.
and
according
to
my
best
information
and
belief
that
they
were
not
given
that
opportunity,
their
hearing,
it
was
devoted
solely
to
the
question
of
asking
--
being
asked
to
explain
their
refusal
to
testify
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
before
the
--
before
the
grand
jury,
i'm
sorry,
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
norman
redlich
with
regard
to
those
three,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
you
have
a
very
similar
issue
to
what
you
had
yesterday
in
gardner.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
because
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
no
what
i
said
was
this,
that
they
were
charged
with
the
violation
of
section
1123
of
the
charter
and
suspended
pursuant
to
that
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right
and
that
is
not
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i'm
sorry.
mr.
norman
redlich
and
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
my
prior
answer
because
there
followed
a
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
at
that
hearing,
they
were
asked
to
explain
their
refusal
to
answer
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
questions
which
had
been
put
to
them
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
norman
redlich
oh!
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
the
formal
charge
was
a
violation
of
1123,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right
justice
stewart.
my
time
is
long
since
--
long
since
up
and
i
appreciate
your
patience.
my
--
what
we
have
to
say
on
the
wiretapping
question
has
been
adequately
covered
and
ought
to
find
the
question
of
the
prospective
application
of
katz
and
berger,
if
katz
and
berger
applicable
at
all
to
this
situation
which
we
doubt.
the
question
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
testimony
here
used
in
this
--
no
evidence
adduced
from
that
wiretap
used
or
you
have
here
is
a
refusal
to
answer
questions
based
on
the
wiretap.
but
no
use
of
the
evidence
or
in
our
judgment
a
use
of
the
fruits
of
that
evidence.
and
as
we
indicate
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
to
reach
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
of
the
validity
of
the
wiretap,
we
do
feel
that
the
record
which
the
court
has
before
it
at
this
time
is
quite
inadequate
to
make
such
a
constitutional
determination
because
in
order
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
government
employer
may
properly
tap
the
telephones
of
its
employees,
we
believe
most
earnestly
that
the
court
should
have
before
a
better
record
than
it
now
does
concerning
the
circumstances
of
this
phone,
the
rules
and
regulations
of
this
phone,
the
--
those
facts
which
the
employee
would
have
reason
to
know
about
this
particular
phone.
we
do
not,
and
i
emphasize,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
government
has
an
unrestricted
right
to
tap
its
employee's
telephones.
we
feel
that
there
is
a
very
definite
element
of
privacy
with
regard
to
certain
and
perhaps
most
uses
of
government
phones
by
employees.
with
regard
to
this
particular
phone,
we
believe
that
a
full
record
would
demonstrate
that
the
tap
of
this
phone,
it
was
a
reasonable
one.
we
believe
in
conclusion
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
katz
and
berger
should
be
given
prospect
of
application
only.
and
because
of
the
tenuous
length
between
the
tap
in
this
proceeding
that
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
don't
know,
justice
harlan.
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
here
to
defend
the
813-a
proceedings.
i
believe
that
as
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
think
they
could
be
put
in
the
record
as
a
result
of
a
trial.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
believe
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was
that
there
was
no
need
to
give
them
because
of
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
adduced
from
the
tap,
was
not
used.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
situation
where
15
employees
of
the
city
of
new
york
were
called
before
the
city
commissioner
of
investigation
who
is
not
a
prosecutor
in
anywhere
near
the
criminal
sense
or
in
any
sense.
the
commissioner
of
investigation
is
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york.
he
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
if
he
uncovers
any
case
of
criminal
wrongdoing,
he
must
turn
that
evidence
over
to
the
district
attorney
for
proper
criminal
prosecution.
fifteen
employees
were
questioned
by
their
employer
because
the
commissioner
of
investigation
is
a
commissioner
of
the
city
of
new
york.
they
were
question
concerning
specific
matters
relating
to
the
performance
of
their
duty,
an
allegation
coming
from
a
citizen
complaint
that
there
was
at
the
91st
pre-transfer
station,
a
conspiracy
which
was
costing
the
city
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
difficulty
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
hearings
you
see
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
are
not
part
of
this
--
are
not
part
of
this
record
and
it
is
not
--
that
point
is
relevant
of
course
in
terms
of
the
--
in
terms
of
the
question
of
the
wiretapping.
mr.
norman
redlich
but
the
--
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
the
citizen
complaint
was
or
was
not
the
source
of
the
wiretap,
that
would
be
going
beyond
the
record
but
the
fact
is
that
someone
complained
to
the
city.
mr.
norman
redlich
in
mr.
freidman's
affidavit
it
is
shown.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
it
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
he
would
have
it,
yes.
the
--
on
the
strength
of
this
information,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
called
these
people
and
asked
them
questions.
now,
in
light
of
yesterday's
discussion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
at
least
with
regard
to
these
12,
there
was
no
question
of
any
--
of
asking
them
to
waive
immunity.
they
were
asked
questions.
they
declined
to
answer
the
questions.
mr.
norman
redlich
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
they
were
then
suspended
and
formal
hearings
were
filed
against
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
--
as
we
have
interpreted
that
1123
in
light
of
slochower,
and
as
we
believe
that
interpretation
has
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
gardner,
we
do
not
dismiss
automatically.
we
hold
a
hearing
and
we
held
one
in
this
case.
a
hearing
was
held
in
which
the
12
employees
or
15
employees
were
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
why
they
have
pleaded
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
and
in
the
hearing
before
the
12,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
charges.
this
was
in
the
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
at
that
point
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
as
to
the
12,
that
was
the
end
of
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
there
was
still
another
proceeding.
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
nature
of
that
proceeding
was
that
they
were
charged
with
a
violation
of
1123.
they
were
asked
to
explain
their
plea
of
the
privilege
and
they
were
asked
if
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
charges.
their
position
was
that
they
stood
by
their
initial
position.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
new
york
court
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
not
affirmatively
stated
that
a
hearing
is
required
under
1123.
this
corporation
counsel,
this
city,
has
taken
the
position
that
a
dismissal
not
--
may
not
be
permitted.
either
under
1123
or
incidentally
under
that
section
which
is
before
you
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
(inaudible)
case
in
an
equivalent
statute.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
a
hearing
must
be
held
in
which
the
employee
is
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
plea
of
the
privilege
and
in
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
slochower.
it
is
our
position
that
what
slochower
precluded
was
an
automatic
inference
of
guilt
resulting
from
a
plea
of
the
privilege
and
that
these
employees
were
entitled
to
due
process,
due
process
requiring
a
separate
hearing
in
which
they
were
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
their
conduct
before
the
original
investigating
agency
and
in
which
in
the
case
of
these
12,
at
least
they
were
offered
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
charges.
mr.
norman
redlich
now,
they
were
asked
if
they
wish
to
--
if
they
wished
to
respond
to
the
--
the
initial
questions
were
asked
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond.
they
said,
they
stood
by
their
initial
position
which
was
a
refusal
to
answer
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
redlich
no.
we
--
mr.
norman
redlich
may
i
ask
you
to
restate
that
because
i
wanted
to
respond?
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
no,
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
read
slochower
as
saying
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
and
at
that
hearing
it
must
be
evident
that
the
questions
that
they
originally
refused
to
answer.
there
were
questions
which
were
directed
to
the
scope
of
their
work.
we
are
not
dealing
hear
with
a
situation
as
in
lerner,
brown
and
nelson
where
you
had
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
question
they
declined
to
answer
were
questions
which
related
to
the
employer-employee
relationship.
here,
there
were
questions
which
they
had
declined
to
answer
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
which
did
relate
very
narrowly
and
specifically
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
performing
the
job
which
they
were
hired
to
perform
for
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
and
we
as
--
mr.
norman
redlich
well
justice
clark's
opinion
talks
about
a
--
the
right
of
an
employer
to
inquire
into
the
employees
fitness
for
office.
and
what
we
have
here
when
the
commissioner
of
investigation
questioned
these
people,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was,
on
behalf
of
the
city,
as
a
city
commissioner
inquiring
in
our
judgment
precisely
into
that.
he
was
asking
these
questions
concerning
the
nature
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
performing
their
work.
a
transcript
of
that
hearing
was
then
presented
to
the
--
to
them
by
the
--
to
the
employees
at
the
commissioner
of
sanitations
hearing.
and
we
really
had
two
proceedings
in
which
the
employees
were
asked
one
questions
relating
to
their
work.
two,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
offer
any
explanations
to
why
they
had
declined
to
answer
and
they
were
perfectly
free
at
that
time
and
in
anytime
to
answer
questions
directly,
narrowly,
specifically
related
to
the
performance
of
their
work.
it
is
our
view
that
we
have
not
discharged
these
employees
out
of
any
automatic
inference
of
guilt.
as
employees,
they
have
an
obligation
to
reply
specifically
to
questions
relating
to
their
work
and
incidentally
as
this
court
has
held
as
we
interpret
in
garrity
and
we
believed
to
be
correct,
if
they
had
responded
to
any
questions
and
admitted
anything
which
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
case
or
the
fruits
of
it
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
case,
they
could
not
have
been
criminally
prosecuted.
taking
that
into
this
whole
picture,
it
is
our
judgment
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
redlich
corporation
counsel.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
said
corporation
counsel.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
slochower
is
in
1957.
mr.
norman
redlich
not
in
--
not
in
every
case.
i
think
the
position
which
was
involved
by
our
predecessors
in
office
was
that
a
hearing
was
necessary,
well,
necessary
is
too
strong.
that
in
--
in
most
cases
a
hearing
would
be
provided.
the
koepnick
case
which
is
referred
to
by
--
by
counsel,
is
a
case
which
i
think
is
peculiar
to
its
facts.
in
that,
it
was
apparent
from
that
case
that
that
a
hearing
would
serve
no
purpose
at
all
and
that
a
--
because
the
witness
was
claiming
there
that
there
was
absolutely
no
right
to
question
them
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
norman
redlich
not(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
not
to
my
knowledge
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
had
to
comment
on
that.
i
really
don't
think
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
not
been
since
slochower
an
automatic
type
of
dismissal.
we
have
a
section
called
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law.
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law
is
the
proceeding
whereby
a
person
is
charged
with
certain
conduct
which
is
a
basis
for
dismissal.
that
has
happened
since
the
slochower
case.
that
happened
in
all
of
these
cases.
these
dismissals
were
pursuant
to
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law.
the
question
is
that
--
the
issue
that
is
before
us
is
whether
at
that
hearing
in
section
75,
if
all
that
you
have
is
the
allegation
that
the
person
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
he
refuses
to
offer
any
explanation
of
it
making
be
dismissed.
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
can.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
in
all
cases,
in
the
matter
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
can
be
discharged
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
norman
redlich
that's
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
no,
because
we
do
believe
we
do
not
go
that
far.
we
believe
that
the
individual
should
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
wouldn't
state
that
the
--
i'm
not
convinced
that
the
federal
privilege
requires
in
light
of
garrity
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
hearing?
mr.
norman
redlich
i
think
that
the
--
in
light
of
the
--
my
answer,
in
light
of
garrity,
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
privilege
requires
it
because
i
think
that
any
evidence
that
is
adduced
here
could
not
be
used
in
any
criminal
proceeding.
i
think
due
process
may
require
it
and
i
think
due
process
might
preclude
us
as
it
may
have
precluded
the
examiners
in
spevack
from
ranging
into
a
--
ranging
out
to
a
scope
of
questions
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
nature
of
the
employee-employer
relationship.
mr.
norman
redlich
which
did
not
happen
here.
mr.
norman
redlich
no.
and
i
think
that
if
they
did
we
would
have
a
serious
due
process
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
only
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
other
part
is
that
if
an
employee
refuses
to
answer
a
question
narrowly
and
specifically
related
to
the
performance
of
this
work,
the
city
need
not
to
keep
that
person
on
the
payroll
indefinitely
so
that
he
can
retire
with
the
city
pension.
we
have
the
right
to
dismiss
it.
mr.
norman
redlich
the
city
even
needs
answers
to
the
questions
or
if
the
answer
doesn't
come
we
have
the
right
to
dismiss.
mr.
norman
redlich
your
honor,
the
history
of
this
charter
provision
has
been
indicated
yesterday.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
that,
however,
by
stating
that
if
any
employee
refused
to
decline
and
did
not
give
any
reason,
we
would
feel
that
we
would
have
a
right
to
dismiss
him
for
the
same
reason
that
we
dismissed
him
here
that
he
refused
to
answer
specific
questions
relating
to
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
norman
redlich
under
--
the
provision
under
which
they
were
--
they
were
discharged
pursuant
to
a
hearing
under
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law
regarding
the
--
under
which
the
city
employee
is
--
he
is
entitled
to
those
rights
and
entitled
to
judicial
review
from
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
would
say
two
things
in
response
to
that.
i
think
this
court
should
consider
these
cases
in
light
of
the
--
the
facts
before
it
namely,
the
hearing
in
all
cases.
and
secondly,
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
there
is
any
violation
of
the
privilege
at
all.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
these
employees
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
criminally
as
the
result
of
any
testimony
at
which
they
may
have
given
under
this
compulsion.
now,
this
is
--
as
a
result
of
the
holding
in
garrity,
i
think
that
this
court
might
well
consider
the
--
applying
a
situation
here
similar
to
what
you
had
in
murphy
against
waterfront
commission.
these
12
employees
may
well
have
been
or
these
15
employees
may
well
have
been
faced
with
the
--
with
what
in
their
mind
was
a
serious
danger
that
if
they
--
that
they
were
faced
with
--
between
the
rock
and
the
whirlpool.
in
fact,
we
feel
that
the
rock
no
longer
exists.
the
rock
has
certainly
not
existed
from
the
time
that
this
court's
decision
in
garrity
because
any
testimony
which
these
employees
would
give
under
these
circumstances,
they
would
not
be
used
nor
prove
any
of
the
fruits
of
that
testimony
be
used.
in
light
of
that
fact,
we
do
not
see
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
privilege.
the
privilege
does
not
protect
against
being
fired
if
you
refuse
to
answer.
the
privilege
does
protect
against
criminal
prosecution
and
we
believe
strongly
that
our
employees
are
entitled
to
and
should
receive
that
protection
and
that
is
why
we
welcome
the
decision
of
this
court
in
garrity.
mr.
norman
redlich
you
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
they
are
not
in
the
--
they
are
not
in
this
particular
record
because
the
hearing
took
place
after
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
your
honor.
the
purpose
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
charge
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation?
mr.
norman
redlich
it
was
a
charge
that
these
employees
had
violated
section
1123
of
the
charter.
and
at
that
hearing,
as
i
understand
it,
at
that
hearing
they
were
--
the
employees
were
presented
with
a
transcript
of
the
inquiry
which
had
been
conducted
previously
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
tape
to
--
no,
no
not
the
wiretapping,
no.
this
was
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
in
which
the
commissioner
of
investigation
asked
them
questions
concerning
this
alleged
conspiracy
and
they
declined
to
answer
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
now,
that
is
the
transcript
that
i'm
referring
to,
nothing
having
to
do
with
the
wiretap.
the
--
that
transcript
was
presented
to
the
employees
at
the
hearing
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
and
they
were
informed
that
they
would
be
in
charge
for
the
violation
of
section
1123.
they
were
asked
at
this
time
whether
they
wish
to
explain
their
plea
of
the
privilege
and
they
were
also
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
original
questions
to
the
15
were
about
the
allegation
that
they
had
taken
money
from
private
cartmen
and
pocketed
the
money
instead
of
picking
up
the
tickets
which
they
were
supposed
to
pick
up.
those
were
the
original
questions
posed
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
those
were
the
questions
which
we
feel
they
as
employees
should
have
answered,
they
didn't
answer.
now,
then
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
they
were
--
at
the
second
proceeding
although
the
formal
charge
against
them
was
a
violation
of
1123,
they
were
asked
as
i
understand
it
two
things
at
the
second
hearing
which
mr.
justice
white
refers
to.
they
were
asked
whether
they
had
any
explanation
for
their
refusal
to
testify
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
and
then
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
--
now,
to
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
them.
and
the
state
--
mr.
norman
redlich
you
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
ask
that
--
i've
answered
the
question
as
best
as
i
can,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
--
mr.
norman
redlich
could
i
respond
to
that?
the
reason
this
is
not
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
this
action
was
brought
to
enjoin
the
very
hearing
which
subsequently
took
place.
in
fact,
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case
came
down
prior
to
the
hearing.
the
district
court
decision
was
in
december
1966.
the
hearings
didn't
take
place
until
january,
so
we
have
an
incomplete
record
in
that
sense,
which
the
normal
procedure
challenging
this
type
of
proceeding
as
in
gardner
would
be
to
go
up
under
in
article
78.
mr.
norman
redlich
your
honor
i
--
mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice
the
formal
charge
levied
against
these
employees
was
that
they
had
violated
section
1123
of
the
charter.
in
that,
they
had
refused
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
to
respond
to
his
questions
relating
to
their
work.
mr.
norman
redlich
although
it
is
necessary
to
answer
that
to
go
beyond
the
record,
answering
it
to
the
best
of
my
information,
i
will.
mr.
norman
redlich
pardon?
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
i'm
answering
it
to
the
best
of
my
information
mr.
chief
justice
with
regard
to
the
12;
they
were
offered
that
opportunity
with
regard
--
mr.
norman
redlich
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
original
questions
that
had
been
asked
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
with
regard
to
the
three,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
with
regard
to
the
12
who
had
pleaded
the
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
who
then
went
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
according
to
my
best
information
and
belief,
they
were
asked
whether
they
wished
now
to
answer
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
of
them
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation,
they
declined.
now,
with
regard
to
the
three
who
did
originally
answer
the
questions
and
then
went
before
the
grand
jury,
they
had
a
separate
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
the
next
day
after
the
12
--
i'm
sorry
they
went
for
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
the
next
day
after
the
12.
and
according
to
my
best
information
and
belief
that
they
were
not
given
that
opportunity,
their
hearing,
it
was
devoted
solely
to
the
question
of
asking
--
being
asked
to
explain
their
refusal
to
testify
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
before
the
--
before
the
grand
jury,
i'm
sorry,
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
norman
redlich
with
regard
to
those
three,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
you
have
a
very
similar
issue
to
what
you
had
yesterday
in
gardner.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
because
the
--
mr.
norman
redlich
no
what
i
said
was
this,
that
they
were
charged
with
the
violation
of
section
1123
of
the
charter
and
suspended
pursuant
to
that
--
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right
and
that
is
not
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i'm
sorry.
mr.
norman
redlich
and
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
my
prior
answer
because
there
followed
a
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation.
at
that
hearing,
they
were
asked
to
explain
their
refusal
to
answer
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
they
were
asked
whether
they
wish
to
respond
to
the
questions
which
had
been
put
to
them
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
norman
redlich
oh!
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes,
the
formal
charge
was
a
violation
of
1123,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
redlich
that
is
right
justice
stewart.
my
time
is
long
since
--
long
since
up
and
i
appreciate
your
patience.
my
--
what
we
have
to
say
on
the
wiretapping
question
has
been
adequately
covered
and
ought
to
find
the
question
of
the
prospective
application
of
katz
and
berger,
if
katz
and
berger
applicable
at
all
to
this
situation
which
we
doubt.
the
question
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
testimony
here
used
in
this
--
no
evidence
adduced
from
that
wiretap
used
or
you
have
here
is
a
refusal
to
answer
questions
based
on
the
wiretap.
but
no
use
of
the
evidence
or
in
our
judgment
a
use
of
the
fruits
of
that
evidence.
and
as
we
indicate
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
to
reach
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
of
the
validity
of
the
wiretap,
we
do
feel
that
the
record
which
the
court
has
before
it
at
this
time
is
quite
inadequate
to
make
such
a
constitutional
determination
because
in
order
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
government
employer
may
properly
tap
the
telephones
of
its
employees,
we
believe
most
earnestly
that
the
court
should
have
before
a
better
record
than
it
now
does
concerning
the
circumstances
of
this
phone,
the
rules
and
regulations
of
this
phone,
the
--
those
facts
which
the
employee
would
have
reason
to
know
about
this
particular
phone.
we
do
not,
and
i
emphasize,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
government
has
an
unrestricted
right
to
tap
its
employee's
telephones.
we
feel
that
there
is
a
very
definite
element
of
privacy
with
regard
to
certain
and
perhaps
most
uses
of
government
phones
by
employees.
with
regard
to
this
particular
phone,
we
believe
that
a
full
record
would
demonstrate
that
the
tap
of
this
phone,
it
was
a
reasonable
one.
we
believe
in
conclusion
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
katz
and
berger
should
be
given
prospect
of
application
only.
and
because
of
the
tenuous
length
between
the
tap
in
this
proceeding
that
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
don't
know,
justice
harlan.
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
redlich
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
here
to
defend
the
813-a
proceedings.
i
believe
that
as
--
mr.
norman
redlich
i
think
they
could
be
put
in
the
record
as
a
result
of
a
trial.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
mr.
norman
redlich
i
believe
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was
that
there
was
no
need
to
give
them
because
of
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
adduced
from
the
tap,
was
not
used.
mr.
norman
redlich
yes.
