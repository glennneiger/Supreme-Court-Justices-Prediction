in

apparently
the

does
have
some
administrative

whether

you

let
me
see,
is
this
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
hearing
and
the
city
in
fact
determines
that
this
justification
and
in
particular
circumstances
there
ought
not
to
be
a
dismissal?
i
gather
your
point
is
that
this
would
be
violative
of
1123,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

let's
see,
your
court
of
appeals
has
sustained
not
in
this
case
but
on
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

was
there
a

in
the

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
was
there
in
fact
a
hearing
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
maybe
read
as
in
the
fact
that
they
should
be
using
your
words
that
the
statute
has
a
built-in
provision
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
the
fact
mr.
redlich
that
under
the
charter
provisions,
once
they
had
refused
to
answer
on
ground
for
self-incrimination,
there
was
no
alternative
for
the
commissioner
of
what
to
suspend?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
getting
a
little
confused.
the
--
it
was
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
that
they
refused
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination
to
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
--
was
that
the
end
of
the
hearing,
as
to
the
12?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
there
was
still
another
proceeding,
wasn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
for
the
12?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
before
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
nature
of
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
i
understand
that
it's
your
position
that
either
in
gardner
or
some
other
case,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
it's
a
requisite
before
there
may
be
a
dismissal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there'll
be
such
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
position
sought
necessary
by
reason
of
any
decision
of
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

he
might
get
it
if
the
city
taking
this
position?
slochower
of
course
--
slochower
serve
the
privilege
not
in
connection
with
any
inquiry
into
any
conduct
of
his
as
an
employee
but
before
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
city
make
a
distinction
and
say,
“in
so
far
as
the
privilege
is
concerned,
when
the
city's
inquiry
is
into
the
conduct
as
an
employee
of
an
employee,
the

does
not
complete
his
dismissal
if
he
asserts
the
privilege
and
refuses
to
answer
questions
directed
to
his
conduct
as
an
employee.”
does
the
city
go
that
far?
so
that
in
other
words
the
whole
hearing
requirement
the
rest
of
it
is
really
--
is
really
not
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
the
privilege,
the
federal
privilege
requires
that
that
would
be
that
opportunity,
is
that
it,
before
he
maybe
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
then
the
federal
constitutional
requires
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

nor
does
that
happen
in
any
of

it
