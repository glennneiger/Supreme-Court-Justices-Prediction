mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
to
review
by
certiorari
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
affirming
the
dismissal
of
a
complaint
of
the
petitioners
who
sought
review
of
the
dismissal
from
employment
by
the
department
of
sanitation
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
dismissal
predicated
exclusively
upon
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
the
individual
petitioners
were
garbage
collectors,
sanitation
that
as
they
had
called
in
the
brief
who
were
employed
at
a
city
dump
to
which
private
cartmen
brought
garbage.
the
commissioner
of
investigation
with
powers
independent
of
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
under
sections
803
and
805
of
the
new
york
city
charter,
believing
that
a
crime
was
being
committed
namely
that
these
garbage
collectors
were
taking
money
from
the
cartmen
instead
of
requiring
the
cartmen
to
pay
fees
to
the
city.
secured
a
wiretap
order
under
section
813-a
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
berger
case,
and
wiretapped
the
telephone
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
was
a
wiretap
in
this
case
--
and
wiretapped
the
telephone
at
the
office
of
the
commission
of
sanitation
at
the
dump.
he
then
subpoenaed
or
was
then
directed
the
individual
petitioner.
there
are
15
in
number,
to
appear
before
him,
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
he
put
them
under
oath,
had
stenographic
record
made,
advised
them
that
they
were
charged
with
crimes,
advised
them
that
he
had
wiretapped
the
telephone
and
their
conversations,
advised
them
that
they
had
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
and
they
also
interpolate
that
he
played
the
recordings
of
their
conversations
with
other
persons
what
purported
to
be
recordings,
but
advised
them
that
if
they
say
that
they're
privileged
against
self-incrimination
as
a
ground
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
then
in
accordance
with
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter,
which
he
cited
to
them
and
cited
fairly
to
them,
they
would
be
automatically
dismissed
from
employment.
now,
the
past
diverge,
12
of
the
individual
petitioners,
these
employees
asserted
their
constitutional
privilege
at
a
number
of
cases
after
getting
the
advice
of
various
counsels.
as
to
those
12,
they
were
immediately
suspended
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
their
immediate
employer,
in
a
letter
which
said
they
were
suspended
pursuant
to
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
and
since
that
provision
which
was
involved
in
gardner
against
broderick
was
never
read
to
this
court
and
since
its
language
we
think
in
view
of
our
reliance
on
slochower
is
critical.
let
me
just
read
the
critical
lines
from
our
point
of
view
of
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
it
says
that
if
any
employee
of
the
city
shall
refuse
to
testify
or
answer
any
question
regarding
the
property,
government
or
affairs
of
the
city,
or
official
conduct
of
such
an
employee,
on
the
ground
that,
the
only
ground,
on
the
ground
that
his
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
shall
refuse
to
waive
immunity
from
prosecution
on
account
of
any
such
matter,
his
term
or
tenure
of
office
or
employment
shall
terminate
and
such
office
or
employment
shall
be
vacant
and
he
shall
not
be
eligible
for
electoral
appointment
to
any
office
or
employment
under
the
city
or
any
agency.
these
12
after
getting
this
notice
of
their
suspension
and
of
charges
were
told
that
they
could
have
a
hearing,
the
purposes
of
which
i
will
question
in
a
few
minutes,
and
they
had
a
pro
forma
hearing
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
below
was
limited
to
one
thing,
did
they
take
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation?
and
they
went
there
upon,
dismissed
from
employment,
not
on
the
ground
of
any
substantive
proof
of
any
irregularities
or
violation
but
on
the
ground
that
1123
of
the
charter
required
their
dismissal.
in
fact,
anticipated
their
dismissal
by
making
the
office
forfeit
the
moment
they
had
asserted
their
privilege.
now,
we
take
the
three,
the
three
who
did
not
assert
their
privilege
against
self-crimination,
but
who
answered
the
commissioner
of
investigation
denying
the
existence
of
any
irregularities
or
misconduct.
those
three
were
then
suspended
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
for
irregularities
by
which
he
meant
criminal
misconduct.
and
they
were
then,
through
the
apparatus
of
the
commissioner
of
investigation
who
as
your
honors
will
see
serious
police
functions
here,
then
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
by
the
district
attorney
who
would
receive
the
information
from
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
when
they
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
these
three
were
not
asked
to
testify
and
given
immunity
under
2447
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
mentioned
to
your
honors
yesterday
in
the
gardner
against
broderick
case
which
would
have
given
them
immunity
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
instead,
they
were
asked
to
waive
immunity
under
section
2446.
the
provision
discussed
the
stevens
against
marks
which
would
of
course
have
left
a
viable
we
think
to
prosecution
for
the
transaction
possibly
for
more
on
its
face
and
under
the
decisions
of
the
appellate
division
in
new
york
would
even
have
permitted
their
words
to
be
used
against
them.
there
are
cases
of
that
kind
of
the
appellate
division
which
are
not
cited
said
in
our
brief
directly.
when
they,
not
refusing
to
answer
questions
addressing
myself
to
the
point
made
by
justice
fortas
and
other
members
of
the
court
yesterday,
when
they
refused
to
execute
this
waiver
which
was
involved
in
regan
and
involved
in
stevens,
they
were
then
served
with
new
charges
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
their
employer,
charging
them
with
having
refused
to
waive
immunity
and
they
were
then
given
a
hearing.
and
again
the
hearings
with
a
pro
forma
were
unlimited
to
the
question
of
whether
they
had
refused
to
waive.
when
they
insisted
at
the
hearing
before
a
deputy
commissioner
of
sanitation,
that
the
commissioner
should
proceed
on
the
charges
of
irregularities
the
original
charges,
the
commissioner
refused
to
do
so
and
limited
the
issue
to
the
one
question,
did
they
assert
their
constitutional
privilege?
did
they
refuse
to
waive
immunity
before
the
grand
jury?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
earlier
hearing,
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
three
or
the
12.
the
12
people
had
asserted
their
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
these
three
had
answered
the
questions
put
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
it
was
because
they
refused
to
waive
their
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
that
these
three
were
then
dismissed
from
employment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
dismissed
as
the
charter
request
them
to
be
dismissed.
we
don't
question
the
fact
that
the
charter
was
correctly
carried
out
although
we
think
it
was
a
violation
of
this
court's
decision
slochower.
now,
i
come
before
i
come
to
the
details
of
my
argument,
let
me
indicate
your
honors
the
three
basic
points
of
our
argument
which
are
--
each
of
which
is
an
independent
ground
for
the
relief
which
we
seek
and
i
emphasized
the
independence
of
the
points.
and
as
your
honors
will
see
i
do
not
agree
in
my
construction
of
the
statute
as
i
refer
to
the
charter
with
either
the
appellant
or
the
appellee's
discussion
of
it
in
gardner
against
broderick
yesterday
with
all
due
deference.
our
first
point
is
that
a
statute
which
forfeits
or
declares
employment
forfeit
automatically,
unconditionally
and
irrevocably
upon
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
as
a
ground
for
refusing
to
answer
questions,
denies
due
process
on
the
slochower
and
violates
the
privilege
under
malloy.
this
is
the
slochower
point,
our
principal
argument
here.
our
second
point
is
the
point
upon
with
so
much
of
the
discussion
yesterday
developed
and
it
is
that
the
refusal
to
answer,
we
would
submit,
even
an
employer's
questions
based
upon
the
constitutional
privilege
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
a
public
employee.
this
we
will
call
the
spevack
extension,
the
griffin
point,
the
general
question
of
a
penalty
or
making
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
coarsely.
and
our
third
point
is
that
in
any
event,
the
situation
here
of
refusal
to
answer.
this
being
a
refusal
to
answer
in
a
criminal
investigation
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
a
public
employee
even
if
an
employer
who
ask
questions
of
a
disciplinary
proceeding
of
a
kind
referred
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
his
concurring
opinion
were
to
have
the
right
to
ask
the
questions.
and
let
me
proceed,
if
i
may
your
honors,
with
my
first
point
which
is
one
upon
which
rely
on
most
because
there
is
less
dispute
as
to
that
and
because
this
court
has
spoken
to
the
point
in
slochower.
this
court
held
in
slochower
that
section
903
of
the
charter
which
is
identical
in
language
with
the
1123,
identical,
violated
due
process.
that
time
we
didn't
have
malloy
against
hogan
because
it
had
operated
to
discharge
every
city
employee
automatically
who
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege.
and
this
court
relied
upon
the
construction,
the
construction
never
changed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
daniman
case.
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
stated,
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
equivalent
to
a
resignation.
and
it's
said
there
is
nothing
noble
about
such
a
statute.
other
statutes
provide
for
the
--
or
interpolate
forfeiture
of
an
office
or
employment
upon
the
happening
of
an
event
specified
therein.
mr.
justice
clark
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court
regarded
the
questions
asked,
i'm
quoting,
“as
being
confessed.”
mr.
justice
harlan
dissenting
gave
a
different
view
to
the
statute,
a
view
upon
which
we
rely
here
for
our
argument
as
well
as
upon
mr.
justice
clark's.
cause
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
even
incrimination
would
not
result
in
a
dismissal
under
1123
or
903
as
it
had
been
was
and
i
would
add
that
even
refusal
to
answer
for
any
ground
other
than
the
fifth
would
not
be
a
basis
for
dismissal
under
1123.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
you
said
correctly
that
it
was
the
exercise
of
the
privilege
which
is
the
basis
for
the
discharge
under
903
of
the
charter.
and
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
nelson
case
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
lerner
against
casey
reiterated
the
fact
that
this
charter
was
directed
specifically
at
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
not
against
the
general
refusal
to
answer.
here
we
are
with
exactly
the
same
language
of
the
charter
and
that
was
why
i
was
so
surprised
to
hear
some
counsel
say
yesterday
that
this
was
not
an
automatic
dismissal
from
employment
under
the
charter.
as
a
mater
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
in
gardner
against
broderick,
the
latest
word
on
the
subject
does
not
suggest
any
new
construction,
any
change
from
the
construction
which
then
gave
to
the
charter
in
daniman
and
the
appellate
division
for
the
first
department
in
koepnick
case
cited
our
replied
brief
on
page
3
said,
“it
will
be
observed
that
as
the
event
itself
which
terminates
the
employment
rather
than
any
adjudication
or
finding
of
the
same
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so,”
said
the
appellate
division
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
statute
provides
for
a
procedure
which
is
self-executing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we'll
come
to
that.
the
city
has
simply
pulled
this
administrative
procedure
out
of
the
hat
as
a
façade,
if
i
may
suggest
most
respectfully,
as
a
facade
to
meet
what
the
court
of
--
what
this
court
said
in
slochower,
when
it
said
that
it
will
be
different
if
there
were
a
hearing
to
go
into
the
qualifications
for
employment
of
the
employee.
this
court
was
not
discussing
of
the
possibility
of
a
hearing
under
1123
which
permits
of
no
hearing.
this
court
was
talking
about
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
it
does
not
permit
it.
the
1123
requires
the
dismissal
from
employment.
in
fact
that
declares
the
office
vacant.
and
this
is
a
position
which
is
respected
by
the
city
itself
in
the
case
which
we
cited
in
our
replied
brief.
where
the
city
--
in
connection
with
the
question
of
a
hearing
--
i'm
talking
about
a
police
officer
said,
“a
hearing
presumably
before
the
police
commissioner
following
petitioner's
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
have
been
a
useless
formality,
this
in
1967
your
honor.
there
can
be
no
dispute
as
to
the
essential
facts
that
make
the
statute
operative
that
it
referred
to
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
and
it
said
nothing
could
be
brought
out
of
the
hearing
even
if
one
will
require
it
to
be
held
that
could
in
any
way
all
to
the
essential
facts
that
brought
charter
1123
into
operation.
the
police
commissioner
has
properly
and
lawfully
terminated
the
petitioner's
employment.
now,
the
question
is
where
is
this
hearing
coming
from?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
my
point
would
be
that
the
kind
of
a
hearing
contemplated
by
slochower
was
a
hearing
in
which
i
think
in
inquiring
would
be
made
as
to
the
suitability
for
employment
of
the
employee.
the
1123
of
the
charter
has
no
--
it
gives
no
leeway
for
such
a
hearing
because
1123
of
the
charter
is
mandatory
as
the
corporation
counselor
said,
in
connection
with
the
dismissal.
and
the
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
daniman
originally.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
in
daniman
--
in
daniman,
there
was
no
hearing.
daniman
your
honor
will
recall
was
an
involvement
appearance
originally
before
congressional
committee.
the
court
of
appeals
did
said
--
did
not
indicate
that
any
hearing
was
contemplated
by
the
statute
even
there.
and
in
gardner
against
broderick,
the
case
argued
yesterday,
there
was
no
suggestion
made
in
that
case
that
a
hearing
procedure
was
now
built
into
1123.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
hearing
in
gardner?
yes.
when
the
hearing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
otherwise
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
made
some
change
in
its
construction
of
the
statute
as
calling
immediately
for
the
resignation.
i
would
like
to
add
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
a
hearing
in
this
case
in
which
the
only
issue
was
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
point
out
was
the
privilege
taken.
it
said
that
the
transcript
was
presented
at
that
hearing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
only
case
in
which
a
hearing
could
have
had
any
relevance
would
either
show
that
he
didn't
take
the
privilege
or
that
he
didn't
have
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
but
that
of
course
would
not
mitigate
--
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
if
that
a
hearing
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
a
discharge
under
1123
of
the
charter
would
not
be
permitted
if
there
was
simply
a
refusal
to
answer
questions.
it's
only
where
the
refusal
is
based
upon
the
privilege
that
the
dismissal
occurs
automatically.
now,
the
questions
that
arise
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
is
a
hearing
but
the
hearing
has
no
meaning.
it
is
not
the
hearing
that
was
intended
by
this
court
in
slochower.
let
me
consider
with
your
honor
the
question
of
what
would
happen
at
a
hearing
or
the
possibilities.
a
hearing
at
which
one
would
attempt
to
justify
the
assertion
of
a
privilege
is
obviously
not
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
could
be
contemplated
because
it
would
violate
the
general
principle
protective
of
the
privilege
at
the
explanation
i
referred
to
cases
like
huffman
that
the
explanation
of
the
privilege
is
in
a
sense
its
waiver.
you
can't
call
a
man
to
a
hearing
and
say,
“tell
us
what
you
did
and
that
you've
justified
your
assertion
of
the
privilege.”
now,
the
other
question
is,
could
that
be
any
possible
hearing
before
that
commissioner
of
sanitation
at
which
you
could
say,
“yes
i
took
the
privilege
but
i
don't
want
to
be
dismissed
even
though
i
took
the
privilege.”
the
answer
is
no.
the
corporation
counsel
agrees.
in
other
ways,
you
couldn't
justify
the
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
by
saying,
“well
it
dealt
with
the
event
20
years
ago.”
well,
it
would
have
meant
that
i
would
have
hurt
somebody
else
out
or
--
and
i
really
wasn't
worried
hurting
myself,
or
the
damage
to
me
would
have
been
so
great
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
of
course
in
that
particular
incident.
my
point
is
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
right,
he
would
have
avoided
it.
but
there
is
no
possible
situation
in
which
a
man
can
appear
before
the
sanitation
commission,
admit
he
has
taken
the
privilege
and
then
say
don't
dismiss
me
because
the
charter
requires
his
dismissal.
when
we
talk
about
a
hearing,
unless
we
are
really
talking
about
a
facade,
it
must
be
a
hearing
to
a
purpose.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
but
that's
still
doesn't
mitigate
the
effect
of
slochower
because
on
the
slochower
the
fact
that
you
took
the
privilege
and
only
the
fact
that
you
took
the
privilege
is
not
a
ground
for
a
dismissal.
and
the
fact
that
a
hearing
is
given
to
underlying
the
fact
that
you
have
taken
the
privilege
can't
possibly
change
the
situation.
you
are
still
being
discharged
for
taking
the
privilege.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
yes,
the
statute
would
clearly
be
inoperative.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute
that
it
deals
only
with
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
the
statute
is
not
susceptible
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
right,
but
it
does
not
--
the
statute
does
not
permit
the
interpretation
because
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
it
does,
that
any
ground
for
refusal
to
answer
except
the
privilege
call
for
the
forfeiture
of
employment
under
that
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
there
are
no
cases.
i
doubt
that
anyone
would
claim
that
a
refusal
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
is
not
pertinent
to
the
refusal
to
the
answer
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
can't
cite
any
cases
that
this
charter
is
susceptible
of
that
construction.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
there
is.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
now,
our
second
point
is
the
point
that
is
most
in
controversy.
it
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
an
employer
asked
questions
--
the
questions
must
be
answered.
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
implications
of
the
majority
opinion
in
spevack
were
the
implications
that
encouraged
mr.
justice
fortas
on
to
be
adopted
by
the
court.
we
have
said
as
much
as
we
can
in
our
brief
on
that
point
and
well,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
further
to
it.
i
think
that
i
must
turn
to
the
third
aspect
of
my
argument.
i
doubt
that
i
will
reach
the
wiretapping
point
in
which
i
point
out
your
honors
that
this
is
not
an
inquiry
by
an
employer.
this
is
an
inquiry
on
the
one
case
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation
exercising
police
functions
under
813-a.
commissioner
who
has
the
power
to
subpoena
and
to
evoke
contempt
proceedings,
have
testimony
before
him,
made
a
basis
of
perjury
prosecutions.
very
different
from
the
kind
of
disciplinary
proceeding
that
we
think
was
within
the
contemplation
of
--
it
should
have
been
with
the
contemplation
of
the
concurrence
in
spevack
against
klein.
and
of
course
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
there
we
have
a
criminal
proceeding.
we
don't
have
an
inquiry
by
an
employer.
if
i
may
turn
briefly
to
the
last
point
of
my
argument
and
that
relates
to
the
question
of
why
it's
happening.
the
investigation
was
instituted
as
a
result
of
a
wiretap.
it
is
our
argument
there
that
the
investigation,
the
choice
that
was
given
to
our
clients
to
assert
the
privilege
or
not,
to
waive
immunity
or
not,
was
the
direct
result
of
the
wiretapping
that
was
brought
on
and
that
we
think
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution
under
both
berger
and
katz
--
for
berger
and
katz
jointly.
the
argument
is
made
by
the
--
by
my
friends
here
that
the
connection
between
the
wiretapping
and
the
hearing,
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
is
tenuous.
we
don't
think
it's
tenuous,
we
think
that
so
far
as
this
record
shows
this
hearing
was
instituted
by
wiretapping
these
hearings
andwouldn't
have
occurred
in
the
absence
of
wiretapping.
we
think
the
wiretapping
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act
as
well
as
the
constitution.
the
argument
with
respect
to
retroactivity
which
is
developed
by
my
friends
here,
we've
addressed
ourselves
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
no
evidence,
this
is
a
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
is
inactive
fruits
doctrine.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
your
honor.
and
may
i
reserve
less
few
minutes
of
my
rebuttal.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we're
told
that
a
confidential
informant
triggered
the
wiretapping
and
i
reminded
the
court
of
what
chief
judge
learned
hand
said
when
he
pointed
out
in
the
case
that
i
was
involved
in
that
the
confidential
informant
was
the
wiretapper.
so
that
we
don't
really
know
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
was
by
court
order,
an
order
apparently
secured
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation
himself.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
we
asked
counsel
--
rather
–
we
asked
the
department
of
sanitation,
department
of
investigation,
one
of
them
to
give
us
the
court
order,
to
give
us
the
affidavit
that
was
refused
us
it's
indicated
in
the
brief
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
answer
to
a
question
was
put
by
the
chief
justice
by
mr.
justice
fortas
will
come
clearer
by
a
reference
to
69-a
of
the
record
which
consist
of
the
model
so-called
charge
which
was
only
a
charge,
69-a,
your
honor,
only
a
charge
of
violating
1123
of
the
charter
and
not
a
charge
of
substantive
crime.
secondly,
your
honor
will
see
it
referred
only
to
1123.
this
was
what
we
understood
where
the
charges
upon
which
we
were
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
and
not
on
the
substantive
charges
of
irregularity
indeed
with
respect
to
the
substantive
charges
of
irregularity
that
were
actually
put
in
writing
concerning
the
three,
the
corporation
counsel
refuse
to
go
into
the
matter,
if
your
honors
recall
i
indicated.
they
wanted
to
limit
this
to
1123
and
did
you
take
the
privilege.
now,
the
suggestion
that
is
made
here
that
somehow
rather,
we
would
be
getting
immunity
if
we
had
testified
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation,
i
think,
is
the
answer
is
given
by
the
discussion
yesterday
that
under
2446,
that
is
the
waiver
of
immunity.
and
certainly,
here
whether
it
was
not
even
the
2446,
there
would
not
have
been
an
immunity
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
but
none
of
our
people
were
told
that
they
would
get
the
ultimately
discovered
garrity
immunity
if
they
had
appeared
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
or
investigation
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
dispute
it.
i
think
the
charter
is
directly
applicable.
i
make
no
--
obviously
that
didn't
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
employment,
etcetera.
i
would
also
add
that
your
honors
will
recall
statement
made
that
the
commissioner
of
investigation
has
secured
a
wiretapping
order.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
813-a,
your
honors
will
see
that
813-a
limits
the
applicant
for
a
wiretapping
order
to
a
district
attorney,
i
think
i'm
recalling
it
correctly,
or
to
a
police
officer
above
the
rank
of
sergeant,
so
that
in
this
investigation
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was
acting
as
a
police
officer
whatever
may
be
his
relations
with
the
city
of
new
york.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
once
similar
occurred
before.
it
usually
has
it
before,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
and
that
may
have
been
because
the
board
of
education
might
have
had
a
different
mechanism.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
section
75
will
regard
the
hearing
and
the
corporation
counsel
agrees
in
any
kind
of
--
solely
and
this
case
involving
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
these
are
two
different
system.
i
don't
think
incidentally
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
based
upon
charges
that
would
be
filed,
charges
otherwise
comparable
but
the
only
charge
here
is
the
charge
of
1123.
in
other
words,
i
can't
quite
reconcile
the
two
and
find
that
75
could
be
built
into
1123.
we
may
also
just
indicate
that
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
we
have
cited
two
new
york
cases
of
our
reply
brief
which
suggest
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
is
available
in
disciplinary
proceedings
under
new
york
law
generally.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.

the
sense

the
charges
were

i
may
end
with
that
point

mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
make
no
claim
that
75
was
not
--
was
violated
at
any

mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
we
don't
regard
it
into
the
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
to
review
by
certiorari
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
affirming
the
dismissal
of
a
complaint
of
the
petitioners
who
sought
review
of
the
dismissal
from
employment
by
the
department
of
sanitation
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
dismissal
predicated
exclusively
upon
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
the
individual
petitioners
were
garbage
collectors,
sanitation
that
as
they
had
called
in
the
brief
who
were
employed
at
a
city
dump
to
which
private
cartmen
brought
garbage.
the
commissioner
of
investigation
with
powers
independent
of
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
under
sections
803
and
805
of
the
new
york
city
charter,
believing
that
a
crime
was
being
committed
namely
that
these
garbage
collectors
were
taking
money
from
the
cartmen
instead
of
requiring
the
cartmen
to
pay
fees
to
the
city.
secured
a
wiretap
order
under
section
813-a
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
berger
case,
and
wiretapped
the
telephone
at
the
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
was
a
wiretap
in
this
case
--
and
wiretapped
the
telephone
at
the
office
of
the
commission
of
sanitation
at
the
dump.
he
then
subpoenaed
or
was
then
directed
the
individual
petitioner.
there
are
15
in
number,
to
appear
before
him,
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
he
put
them
under
oath,
had
stenographic
record
made,
advised
them
that
they
were
charged
with
crimes,
advised
them
that
he
had
wiretapped
the
telephone
and
their
conversations,
advised
them
that
they
had
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
and
they
also
interpolate
that
he
played
the
recordings
of
their
conversations
with
other
persons
what
purported
to
be
recordings,
but
advised
them
that
if
they
say
that
they're
privileged
against
self-incrimination
as
a
ground
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
then
in
accordance
with
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter,
which
he
cited
to
them
and
cited
fairly
to
them,
they
would
be
automatically
dismissed
from
employment.
now,
the
past
diverge,
12
of
the
individual
petitioners,
these
employees
asserted
their
constitutional
privilege
at
a
number
of
cases
after
getting
the
advice
of
various
counsels.
as
to
those
12,
they
were
immediately
suspended
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
their
immediate
employer,
in
a
letter
which
said
they
were
suspended
pursuant
to
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
and
since
that
provision
which
was
involved
in
gardner
against
broderick
was
never
read
to
this
court
and
since
its
language
we
think
in
view
of
our
reliance
on
slochower
is
critical.
let
me
just
read
the
critical
lines
from
our
point
of
view
of
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
it
says
that
if
any
employee
of
the
city
shall
refuse
to
testify
or
answer
any
question
regarding
the
property,
government
or
affairs
of
the
city,
or
official
conduct
of
such
an
employee,
on
the
ground
that,
the
only
ground,
on
the
ground
that
his
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
shall
refuse
to
waive
immunity
from
prosecution
on
account
of
any
such
matter,
his
term
or
tenure
of
office
or
employment
shall
terminate
and
such
office
or
employment
shall
be
vacant
and
he
shall
not
be
eligible
for
electoral
appointment
to
any
office
or
employment
under
the
city
or
any
agency.
these
12
after
getting
this
notice
of
their
suspension
and
of
charges
were
told
that
they
could
have
a
hearing,
the
purposes
of
which
i
will
question
in
a
few
minutes,
and
they
had
a
pro
forma
hearing
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
below
was
limited
to
one
thing,
did
they
take
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation?
and
they
went
there
upon,
dismissed
from
employment,
not
on
the
ground
of
any
substantive
proof
of
any
irregularities
or
violation
but
on
the
ground
that
1123
of
the
charter
required
their
dismissal.
in
fact,
anticipated
their
dismissal
by
making
the
office
forfeit
the
moment
they
had
asserted
their
privilege.
now,
we
take
the
three,
the
three
who
did
not
assert
their
privilege
against
self-crimination,
but
who
answered
the
commissioner
of
investigation
denying
the
existence
of
any
irregularities
or
misconduct.
those
three
were
then
suspended
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
for
irregularities
by
which
he
meant
criminal
misconduct.
and
they
were
then,
through
the
apparatus
of
the
commissioner
of
investigation
who
as
your
honors
will
see
serious
police
functions
here,
then
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
by
the
district
attorney
who
would
receive
the
information
from
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
when
they
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
these
three
were
not
asked
to
testify
and
given
immunity
under
2447
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
mentioned
to
your
honors
yesterday
in
the
gardner
against
broderick
case
which
would
have
given
them
immunity
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
instead,
they
were
asked
to
waive
immunity
under
section
2446.
the
provision
discussed
the
stevens
against
marks
which
would
of
course
have
left
a
viable
we
think
to
prosecution
for
the
transaction
possibly
for
more
on
its
face
and
under
the
decisions
of
the
appellate
division
in
new
york
would
even
have
permitted
their
words
to
be
used
against
them.
there
are
cases
of
that
kind
of
the
appellate
division
which
are
not
cited
said
in
our
brief
directly.
when
they,
not
refusing
to
answer
questions
addressing
myself
to
the
point
made
by
justice
fortas
and
other
members
of
the
court
yesterday,
when
they
refused
to
execute
this
waiver
which
was
involved
in
regan
and
involved
in
stevens,
they
were
then
served
with
new
charges
by
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
their
employer,
charging
them
with
having
refused
to
waive
immunity
and
they
were
then
given
a
hearing.
and
again
the
hearings
with
a
pro
forma
were
unlimited
to
the
question
of
whether
they
had
refused
to
waive.
when
they
insisted
at
the
hearing
before
a
deputy
commissioner
of
sanitation,
that
the
commissioner
should
proceed
on
the
charges
of
irregularities
the
original
charges,
the
commissioner
refused
to
do
so
and
limited
the
issue
to
the
one
question,
did
they
assert
their
constitutional
privilege?
did
they
refuse
to
waive
immunity
before
the
grand
jury?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
earlier
hearing,
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
three
or
the
12.
the
12
people
had
asserted
their
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
these
three
had
answered
the
questions
put
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
it
was
because
they
refused
to
waive
their
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
that
these
three
were
then
dismissed
from
employment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
dismissed
as
the
charter
request
them
to
be
dismissed.
we
don't
question
the
fact
that
the
charter
was
correctly
carried
out
although
we
think
it
was
a
violation
of
this
court's
decision
slochower.
now,
i
come
before
i
come
to
the
details
of
my
argument,
let
me
indicate
your
honors
the
three
basic
points
of
our
argument
which
are
--
each
of
which
is
an
independent
ground
for
the
relief
which
we
seek
and
i
emphasized
the
independence
of
the
points.
and
as
your
honors
will
see
i
do
not
agree
in
my
construction
of
the
statute
as
i
refer
to
the
charter
with
either
the
appellant
or
the
appellee's
discussion
of
it
in
gardner
against
broderick
yesterday
with
all
due
deference.
our
first
point
is
that
a
statute
which
forfeits
or
declares
employment
forfeit
automatically,
unconditionally
and
irrevocably
upon
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
as
a
ground
for
refusing
to
answer
questions,
denies
due
process
on
the
slochower
and
violates
the
privilege
under
malloy.
this
is
the
slochower
point,
our
principal
argument
here.
our
second
point
is
the
point
upon
with
so
much
of
the
discussion
yesterday
developed
and
it
is
that
the
refusal
to
answer,
we
would
submit,
even
an
employer's
questions
based
upon
the
constitutional
privilege
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
a
public
employee.
this
we
will
call
the
spevack
extension,
the
griffin
point,
the
general
question
of
a
penalty
or
making
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
coarsely.
and
our
third
point
is
that
in
any
event,
the
situation
here
of
refusal
to
answer.
this
being
a
refusal
to
answer
in
a
criminal
investigation
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
a
public
employee
even
if
an
employer
who
ask
questions
of
a
disciplinary
proceeding
of
a
kind
referred
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
his
concurring
opinion
were
to
have
the
right
to
ask
the
questions.
and
let
me
proceed,
if
i
may
your
honors,
with
my
first
point
which
is
one
upon
which
rely
on
most
because
there
is
less
dispute
as
to
that
and
because
this
court
has
spoken
to
the
point
in
slochower.
this
court
held
in
slochower
that
section
903
of
the
charter
which
is
identical
in
language
with
the
1123,
identical,
violated
due
process.
that
time
we
didn't
have
malloy
against
hogan
because
it
had
operated
to
discharge
every
city
employee
automatically
who
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege.
and
this
court
relied
upon
the
construction,
the
construction
never
changed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
daniman
case.
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
stated,
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
equivalent
to
a
resignation.
and
it's
said
there
is
nothing
noble
about
such
a
statute.
other
statutes
provide
for
the
--
or
interpolate
forfeiture
of
an
office
or
employment
upon
the
happening
of
an
event
specified
therein.
mr.
justice
clark
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court
regarded
the
questions
asked,
i'm
quoting,
“as
being
confessed.”
mr.
justice
harlan
dissenting
gave
a
different
view
to
the
statute,
a
view
upon
which
we
rely
here
for
our
argument
as
well
as
upon
mr.
justice
clark's.
cause
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
even
incrimination
would
not
result
in
a
dismissal
under
1123
or
903
as
it
had
been
was
and
i
would
add
that
even
refusal
to
answer
for
any
ground
other
than
the
fifth
would
not
be
a
basis
for
dismissal
under
1123.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
you
said
correctly
that
it
was
the
exercise
of
the
privilege
which
is
the
basis
for
the
discharge
under
903
of
the
charter.
and
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
nelson
case
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
lerner
against
casey
reiterated
the
fact
that
this
charter
was
directed
specifically
at
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
not
against
the
general
refusal
to
answer.
here
we
are
with
exactly
the
same
language
of
the
charter
and
that
was
why
i
was
so
surprised
to
hear
some
counsel
say
yesterday
that
this
was
not
an
automatic
dismissal
from
employment
under
the
charter.
as
a
mater
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
in
gardner
against
broderick,
the
latest
word
on
the
subject
does
not
suggest
any
new
construction,
any
change
from
the
construction
which
then
gave
to
the
charter
in
daniman
and
the
appellate
division
for
the
first
department
in
koepnick
case
cited
our
replied
brief
on
page
3
said,
“it
will
be
observed
that
as
the
event
itself
which
terminates
the
employment
rather
than
any
adjudication
or
finding
of
the
same
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so,”
said
the
appellate
division
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
statute
provides
for
a
procedure
which
is
self-executing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we'll
come
to
that.
the
city
has
simply
pulled
this
administrative
procedure
out
of
the
hat
as
a
façade,
if
i
may
suggest
most
respectfully,
as
a
facade
to
meet
what
the
court
of
--
what
this
court
said
in
slochower,
when
it
said
that
it
will
be
different
if
there
were
a
hearing
to
go
into
the
qualifications
for
employment
of
the
employee.
this
court
was
not
discussing
of
the
possibility
of
a
hearing
under
1123
which
permits
of
no
hearing.
this
court
was
talking
about
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
it
does
not
permit
it.
the
1123
requires
the
dismissal
from
employment.
in
fact
that
declares
the
office
vacant.
and
this
is
a
position
which
is
respected
by
the
city
itself
in
the
case
which
we
cited
in
our
replied
brief.
where
the
city
--
in
connection
with
the
question
of
a
hearing
--
i'm
talking
about
a
police
officer
said,
“a
hearing
presumably
before
the
police
commissioner
following
petitioner's
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
have
been
a
useless
formality,
this
in
1967
your
honor.
there
can
be
no
dispute
as
to
the
essential
facts
that
make
the
statute
operative
that
it
referred
to
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
and
it
said
nothing
could
be
brought
out
of
the
hearing
even
if
one
will
require
it
to
be
held
that
could
in
any
way
all
to
the
essential
facts
that
brought
charter
1123
into
operation.
the
police
commissioner
has
properly
and
lawfully
terminated
the
petitioner's
employment.
now,
the
question
is
where
is
this
hearing
coming
from?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
my
point
would
be
that
the
kind
of
a
hearing
contemplated
by
slochower
was
a
hearing
in
which
i
think
in
inquiring
would
be
made
as
to
the
suitability
for
employment
of
the
employee.
the
1123
of
the
charter
has
no
--
it
gives
no
leeway
for
such
a
hearing
because
1123
of
the
charter
is
mandatory
as
the
corporation
counselor
said,
in
connection
with
the
dismissal.
and
the
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
daniman
originally.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
in
daniman
--
in
daniman,
there
was
no
hearing.
daniman
your
honor
will
recall
was
an
involvement
appearance
originally
before
congressional
committee.
the
court
of
appeals
did
said
--
did
not
indicate
that
any
hearing
was
contemplated
by
the
statute
even
there.
and
in
gardner
against
broderick,
the
case
argued
yesterday,
there
was
no
suggestion
made
in
that
case
that
a
hearing
procedure
was
now
built
into
1123.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
hearing
in
gardner?
yes.
when
the
hearing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
otherwise
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
made
some
change
in
its
construction
of
the
statute
as
calling
immediately
for
the
resignation.
i
would
like
to
add
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
a
hearing
in
this
case
in
which
the
only
issue
was
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
point
out
was
the
privilege
taken.
it
said
that
the
transcript
was
presented
at
that
hearing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
only
case
in
which
a
hearing
could
have
had
any
relevance
would
either
show
that
he
didn't
take
the
privilege
or
that
he
didn't
have
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
but
that
of
course
would
not
mitigate
--
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
if
that
a
hearing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
a
discharge
under
1123
of
the
charter
would
not
be
permitted
if
there
was
simply
a
refusal
to
answer
questions.
it's
only
where
the
refusal
is
based
upon
the
privilege
that
the
dismissal
occurs
automatically.
now,
the
questions
that
arise
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
is
a
hearing
but
the
hearing
has
no
meaning.
it
is
not
the
hearing
that
was
intended
by
this
court
in
slochower.
let
me
consider
with
your
honor
the
question
of
what
would
happen
at
a
hearing
or
the
possibilities.
a
hearing
at
which
one
would
attempt
to
justify
the
assertion
of
a
privilege
is
obviously
not
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
could
be
contemplated
because
it
would
violate
the
general
principle
protective
of
the
privilege
at
the
explanation
i
referred
to
cases
like
huffman
that
the
explanation
of
the
privilege
is
in
a
sense
its
waiver.
you
can't
call
a
man
to
a
hearing
and
say,
“tell
us
what
you
did
and
that
you've
justified
your
assertion
of
the
privilege.”
now,
the
other
question
is,
could
that
be
any
possible
hearing
before
that
commissioner
of
sanitation
at
which
you
could
say,
“yes
i
took
the
privilege
but
i
don't
want
to
be
dismissed
even
though
i
took
the
privilege.”
the
answer
is
no.
the
corporation
counsel
agrees.
in
other
ways,
you
couldn't
justify
the
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
by
saying,
“well
it
dealt
with
the
event
20
years
ago.”
well,
it
would
have
meant
that
i
would
have
hurt
somebody
else
out
or
--
and
i
really
wasn't
worried
hurting
myself,
or
the
damage
to
me
would
have
been
so
great
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
of
course
in
that
particular
incident.
my
point
is
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
right,
he
would
have
avoided
it.
but
there
is
no
possible
situation
in
which
a
man
can
appear
before
the
sanitation
commission,
admit
he
has
taken
the
privilege
and
then
say
don't
dismiss
me
because
the
charter
requires
his
dismissal.
when
we
talk
about
a
hearing,
unless
we
are
really
talking
about
a
facade,
it
must
be
a
hearing
to
a
purpose.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
but
that's
still
doesn't
mitigate
the
effect
of
slochower
because
on
the
slochower
the
fact
that
you
took
the
privilege
and
only
the
fact
that
you
took
the
privilege
is
not
a
ground
for
a
dismissal.
and
the
fact
that
a
hearing
is
given
to
underlying
the
fact
that
you
have
taken
the
privilege
can't
possibly
change
the
situation.
you
are
still
being
discharged
for
taking
the
privilege.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
yes,
the
statute
would
clearly
be
inoperative.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute
that
it
deals
only
with
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
the
statute
is
not
susceptible
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
right,
but
it
does
not
--
the
statute
does
not
permit
the
interpretation
because
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
it
does,
that
any
ground
for
refusal
to
answer
except
the
privilege
call
for
the
forfeiture
of
employment
under
that
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
there
are
no
cases.
i
doubt
that
anyone
would
claim
that
a
refusal
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
is
not
pertinent
to
the
refusal
to
the
answer
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
can't
cite
any
cases
that
this
charter
is
susceptible
of
that
construction.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
there
is.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
now,
our
second
point
is
the
point
that
is
most
in
controversy.
it
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
an
employer
asked
questions
--
the
questions
must
be
answered.
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
implications
of
the
majority
opinion
in
spevack
were
the
implications
that
encouraged
mr.
justice
fortas
on
to
be
adopted
by
the
court.
we
have
said
as
much
as
we
can
in
our
brief
on
that
point
and
well,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
further
to
it.
i
think
that
i
must
turn
to
the
third
aspect
of
my
argument.
i
doubt
that
i
will
reach
the
wiretapping
point
in
which
i
point
out
your
honors
that
this
is
not
an
inquiry
by
an
employer.
this
is
an
inquiry
on
the
one
case
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation
exercising
police
functions
under
813-a.
commissioner
who
has
the
power
to
subpoena
and
to
evoke
contempt
proceedings,
have
testimony
before
him,
made
a
basis
of
perjury
prosecutions.
very
different
from
the
kind
of
disciplinary
proceeding
that
we
think
was
within
the
contemplation
of
--
it
should
have
been
with
the
contemplation
of
the
concurrence
in
spevack
against
klein.
and
of
course
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
there
we
have
a
criminal
proceeding.
we
don't
have
an
inquiry
by
an
employer.
if
i
may
turn
briefly
to
the
last
point
of
my
argument
and
that
relates
to
the
question
of
why
it's
happening.
the
investigation
was
instituted
as
a
result
of
a
wiretap.
it
is
our
argument
there
that
the
investigation,
the
choice
that
was
given
to
our
clients
to
assert
the
privilege
or
not,
to
waive
immunity
or
not,
was
the
direct
result
of
the
wiretapping
that
was
brought
on
and
that
we
think
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution
under
both
berger
and
katz
--
for
berger
and
katz
jointly.
the
argument
is
made
by
the
--
by
my
friends
here
that
the
connection
between
the
wiretapping
and
the
hearing,
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
is
tenuous.
we
don't
think
it's
tenuous,
we
think
that
so
far
as
this
record
shows
this
hearing
was
instituted
by
wiretapping
these
hearings
andwouldn't
have
occurred
in
the
absence
of
wiretapping.
we
think
the
wiretapping
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act
as
well
as
the
constitution.
the
argument
with
respect
to
retroactivity
which
is
developed
by
my
friends
here,
we've
addressed
ourselves
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
was
no
evidence,
this
is
a
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
is
inactive
fruits
doctrine.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
your
honor.
and
may
i
reserve
less
few
minutes
of
my
rebuttal.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we're
told
that
a
confidential
informant
triggered
the
wiretapping
and
i
reminded
the
court
of
what
chief
judge
learned
hand
said
when
he
pointed
out
in
the
case
that
i
was
involved
in
that
the
confidential
informant
was
the
wiretapper.
so
that
we
don't
really
know
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
was
by
court
order,
an
order
apparently
secured
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation
himself.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
we
asked
counsel
--
rather
–
we
asked
the
department
of
sanitation,
department
of
investigation,
one
of
them
to
give
us
the
court
order,
to
give
us
the
affidavit
that
was
refused
us
it's
indicated
in
the
brief
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
answer
to
a
question
was
put
by
the
chief
justice
by
mr.
justice
fortas
will
come
clearer
by
a
reference
to
69-a
of
the
record
which
consist
of
the
model
so-called
charge
which
was
only
a
charge,
69-a,
your
honor,
only
a
charge
of
violating
1123
of
the
charter
and
not
a
charge
of
substantive
crime.
secondly,
your
honor
will
see
it
referred
only
to
1123.
this
was
what
we
understood
where
the
charges
upon
which
we
were
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
and
not
on
the
substantive
charges
of
irregularity
indeed
with
respect
to
the
substantive
charges
of
irregularity
that
were
actually
put
in
writing
concerning
the
three,
the
corporation
counsel
refuse
to
go
into
the
matter,
if
your
honors
recall
i
indicated.
they
wanted
to
limit
this
to
1123
and
did
you
take
the
privilege.
now,
the
suggestion
that
is
made
here
that
somehow
rather,
we
would
be
getting
immunity
if
we
had
testified
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation,
i
think,
is
the
answer
is
given
by
the
discussion
yesterday
that
under
2446,
that
is
the
waiver
of
immunity.
and
certainly,
here
whether
it
was
not
even
the
2446,
there
would
not
have
been
an
immunity
with
respect
to
the
transaction.
but
none
of
our
people
were
told
that
they
would
get
the
ultimately
discovered
garrity
immunity
if
they
had
appeared
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
or
investigation
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
dispute
it.
i
think
the
charter
is
directly
applicable.
i
make
no
--
obviously
that
didn't
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
employment,
etcetera.
i
would
also
add
that
your
honors
will
recall
statement
made
that
the
commissioner
of
investigation
has
secured
a
wiretapping
order.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
813-a,
your
honors
will
see
that
813-a
limits
the
applicant
for
a
wiretapping
order
to
a
district
attorney,
i
think
i'm
recalling
it
correctly,
or
to
a
police
officer
above
the
rank
of
sergeant,
so
that
in
this
investigation
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was
acting
as
a
police
officer
whatever
may
be
his
relations
with
the
city
of
new
york.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
once
similar
occurred
before.
it
usually
has
it
before,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
and
that
may
have
been
because
the
board
of
education
might
have
had
a
different
mechanism.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
section
75
will
regard
the
hearing
and
the
corporation
counsel
agrees
in
any
kind
of
--
solely
and
this
case
involving
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
these
are
two
different
system.
i
don't
think
incidentally
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
based
upon
charges
that
would
be
filed,
charges
otherwise
comparable
but
the
only
charge
here
is
the
charge
of
1123.
in
other
words,
i
can't
quite
reconcile
the
two
and
find
that
75
could
be
built
into
1123.
we
may
also
just
indicate
that
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
we
have
cited
two
new
york
cases
of
our
reply
brief
which
suggest
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
is
available
in
disciplinary
proceedings
under
new
york
law
generally.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
in
the
sense
that
the
hearing
was
offered,
except
the
hearing
was
limited
to
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
except
the
charges
were
limited
if
i
may
end
with
that
point
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
make
no
claim
that
75
was
not
--
was
violated
at
any
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
we
don't
regard
it
into
the
case.
