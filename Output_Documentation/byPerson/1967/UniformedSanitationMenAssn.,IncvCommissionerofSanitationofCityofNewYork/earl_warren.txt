chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
redlich,
may
i
direct
your
attention
once
more
to
the
hearing
that
you
have
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation
in
which
you
have
told
us
that
these
12
men
were
offered
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
charges
and
they
declined
to
respond
to
the
charges.where
in
the
record
do
we
find
those
charges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
me
briefly
what
the
form
and
the
--
of
the
charges
and
what
they
contain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
the
transcript,
are
you
referring
to
the
tapes
of
the
--
the
tapes
of
the
wiretapping?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
get
that
part
of
it
but
--
but
in
these
charges
that
you
refer
to,
were
they're
charged
with
having
done
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing
in
violation
of
their
duties
to
which
they
put
and
responded?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
--
do
we
find
that
colloquy
in
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
we
do,
we
just
take
that
on
fate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wonder
why
that
isn't
in
here.
if
that's
what
the
state
relies
on
i
wonder
why
they
shouldn't
be
here
so
we
can
determine
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
think
--
i
think
the
thing
that
is
bothering
me
is
your
use
of
the
word
charges.
now,
were
there
any
--
is
there
any
document
charging
these
men
with
any
misconduct
any
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
is
it
just
a
question
of
this
man
having
asked
the
question
to
me
didn't
--
they
didn't
respond
that
may
put
those
together
in
some
form
and
you
now
refer
to
them
as
charges.
were
there
any
charges
of
misconduct
against
these
men
for
having
violated
their
duty
as
sanitation
employees?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
at
the
second
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation,
they
were
limited,
were
they,
only
to
the
reasons
why
they
refuse
to
answer
to
the
commissioner?
were
they
offered
the
opportunity
then
to
say,
all
these
questions
in
regard
to
those
question,
we
say
now
that
this
was
the
situation,
that's
the
situation
and
we're
entitled
to
a
trial,
you
want
to
face
it
and
so
forth?
or
were
they
just
asked
why
--
why
did
you
claim
that
privilege
beforehand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
argue
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
almost
have
to
go
beyond
it,
i
guess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
which
opportunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
you
are
placed
with
the
question
as
to
those
three
at
least
of
whether
they
are
--
they
are
fired
just
because
they
refused
before
the
grand
jury
to
waive
their
privilege.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
secret
aren't
they?
they're
secret.
nobody
knows.
the
public
doesn't
know.
they're
not
public
records
or
anything
else
since
a
matter
of
--
since
it
matter
--
a
confidential
matter
between
the
advocate
for
the
wiretap
and
the
judge
who
issues
it,
isn't
that
right?
and
there
are
no
requirement
of
any
recording
of
it
for
public
use
in
anyway
shape
or
form,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
want
to
give
them.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
give
--
did
i
understand
mr.
boudin
to
say
that
in
this
case
he
has
one
and
they
weren't
given
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
