yes,
excuse
me
mr.
boudin
justice
abe
fortas
this
did
not
supersede
or
eliminate
the
earlier
hearing
based
on
their
refusal
to
answer
questions,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
sorry,
i
think
i've
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
don't
understand
that.
you
said
that
they've
given
an
opportunity
to
rebut
any
inference
of
guilt,
guilt
of
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
this
--
your
statement
mean
that
you
reach
slochower
as
meaning
that
if
the
employees
admit
that
they
did
assert
the
privilege
and
for
that
reason
refused
to
testify,
that
they
may
be
dismissed.
is
that
the
way
you
read
slochower,
without
violating
federal
constitution,
they
may
be
dismissed?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
reading?
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
a
hearing?
justice
abe
fortas
the
employees
say
yes,
we
claim
the
privilege
and
we
did
not
answer
the
questions
because
of
the
privilege.
now,
as
you
read
slochower,
does
slochower
stand
for
the
proposition
that
or
that
those
bear
facts
the
employees
may
be
dismissed
without
running
the
file
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
me
just
how
you
read
slochower?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
read
slochower
as
requiring
a
hearing
which
may
be
limited
to
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
of
what
the
questions
were
in
front
of
the
limits
of
the
questions
to
her
as
to
which
they
claimed
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
what
--
that's
now
where
justice
clark's
opinion
says,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
your
emphasis
upon
this
city
counsel
for
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
this
corporation
counsel
for
this
city
administration
bothers
me.
i
appreciate
your
criteria
about
that
but
does
that
mean
that
the
predecessor
of
city
counsel
--
there
was
--
was
there
a
predecessor
corporation
counsel
following
slochower?
justice
abe
fortas
what
position
did
they
take?
did
they
similarly
insist
on
a
hearing
before
termination?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
account
made
to
obtain
a
change
in
the
city
charter
that
bring
it
into
line
with
slochower
or
for
any
reason
they
have
to
slochower?
justice
abe
fortas
--
decision
of
the
city
counsel
or
the
city
charter?
justice
abe
fortas
that
really
makes
kind
of
a
mess,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
suppose
you
are
defending
this
--
i
suppose
you
are
defending
this
on
the
ground
that
it's
necessary
and
proper
for
the
city
to
get
answers
to
these
questions
from
employers
with
respect
to
the
faithful
discharge
in
their
work
in
events
necessary
for
administrative
reasons,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what's
the
other
part?
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
that
is,
that's
an
embellishment
of
it.
but
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
to
--
you're
saying
that
the
city
needs
answers
to
these
questions,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
but
why
then
is
this
--
why
then
has
the
city
here
trying
to
administer
and
defend,
and
defend
a
charter
provision
that
mimics
this
disciplinary
action
to
a
case
where
the
employee
refuses
to
answer
solely
on
the
ground
or
refuses
solely
–
solely
refus
--
solely
to
the
category
of
cases
where
employee
refuses
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment,
a
federal
constitutional
privilege?
why
does
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
him
a
few
moments
ago,
shouldn't
--
if
that
is
the
purpose,
bona
fide
purpose,
why
shouldn't
it
--
this
charter
provision
be
phrased
in
terms
that
are
consonant
with
the
purpose,
that
is
to
say,
if
a
city
employee
refuses
to
answer
questions
appropriately
directed
to
him
by
a
person
in
authority
with
respect
to
his
activities
that
that
will
be
grounds
for
dismissal?
how
do
you
account
for
the
restriction
of
this
charter
provision
to
instances
where
the
refusal
is
based
upon
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
basis?
is
there
another
charter
provision
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
this
statute
--
is
this
charter
provision
is
practiced.
it
seems
to
be
directly,
specifically,
carefully,
pointedly
designed
by
the
drafters
to
penalize
a
person
for
the
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
right.
i
could
understand
that
but
then
this
court
decided
slochower.
and
after
slochower,
you
tell
me
that
as
to
your
knowledge
there
was
no
effort
to
amend
this
charter
provision.
now
this
court
is
faced
with
a
request
in
effect
by
the
city
for
us
to
deal
with
a
situation
which
perhaps
i'm
not
sure,
but
perhaps
could
have
been
dealt
with
by
a
legislative
response
to
an
opinion
to
a
decision
of
this
court
in
slochower.
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
required
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
--
i
don't
understand
this.
on
page
17-a
of
the
joint
appendix,
there's
an
affidavit
of
mr.
delury
in
which
his
quotes
from
the
letter
of
notification
to
the
12
employees
stating
that
their
suspension
was
due
to
the
fact
that
you
invoked
your
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
refused
to
answer.
so
that
--
so
far
as
the
12
aren't
concerned,
am
i
to
take
it
from
this
that
they
were
suspended
because
they
invoked
the
privilege.
justice
abe
fortas
and
thereafter
when
notice
of
hearing
was
served
on,
are
you
telling
us
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
reference
to
the
invocation
of
the
constitutional
privilege?
i
thought
you
said
that
there
was
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time,
what
i
have
read
is
the
notice
that
they
got.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
were
they
given
notice
to
that
hearing
before
the
commissioner
of
sanitation?
justice
abe
fortas
did
that
notice
say
that
you
have
--
that
the
basis
or
part
of
the
basis
was
the
invocation
of
the
constitutional
privilege?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
boudin.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask,
do
you
know
whether
section
75
of
the
civil
service
law
was
enacted
after
the
slochower
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
procedure
was
not
followed
in
the
slochower
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
concede
that
section
75
requires
a
hearing
in
this
type
of
case?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
we
can
read
section
75
into
1123?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
that
section
75
wouldn't
require
a
hearing
in
the
--
in
this
type
of
case.
justice

yes,

you

of

justice

i

is
that

they

justice

is
that

they

the

yes,
we
