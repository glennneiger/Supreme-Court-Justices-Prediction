mr.
edward
f.
howrey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
discuss
two
propositions.
first,
that
the
statute
involved
here
namely
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
means
exactly
what
it
says.
and
when
that
refers
to
competing
customers,
it
refers
to
competitors
who
compete
with
each
other
and
who
buy
for
a
business
of
the
same
third
person.
in
other
words,
the
customers
who
compete
at
the
same
functional
level,
and
secondly,
that
the
government's
construction
requiring
proportional
payments
to
wholesalers
with
the
hope
that
the
wholesaler
will
pass
it
on
to
the
retailers
is
administrative
and
practical,
and
impossible
application
in
the
day-to-day,
early-burley
commercial
work.
first,
the
government
tries
to
analogize
2(d)
to
2(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
i
may
say
that
since
2(a),
a
more
solved
case,
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
whether,
it
does
refer
to
promotional
allowances
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
between
direct
buying
retailers
and
wholesalers
whose
customers
compete
with
direct
buying
retailer
that
2(d)
should
be
construed
the
same
way.
and
now
the
difficulty
here
is
that
2(d)
is
entirely
different
statute
from
2(a),
has
entirely
differently
language.
2(a)
for
example,
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
which
may
injure
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants
or
receives
the
benefit
of
the
discrimination
or
with
customers
of
either
of
that.
it
covers
the
primary
line,
secondary
line
and
the
so-called
tertiary
line.
the
2(d)
doesn't
contain
language
that
even
resembles
them.
2(d)
simply
prohibits
non-proportional
promotional
allowances
only
as
between
“customers
competing”
in
the
distribution
of
the
particular
product.
now,
the
government
argues
in
effect
that
the
word
distribution
as
used
in
section
2(d),
negates
or
at
least
modifies
the
word
‘competing'.
so
as
to
give
the
word
‘competing'
or
‘competition'
an
entirely
different
meaning
of
the
dictionary
or
from
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
the
word,
particularly
in
the
antitrust
field.
in
other
words,
the
government
rewrites
the
statute,
strikes
out
the
words
competing
customers
and
inserts
the
words
engaged
in,
so
as
to
prohibit
non-proportional
payments
to
anyone
engaged
in
the
distribution
of
the
product.
now,
we
think
such
rewriting
the
statute
should
be
left
with
the
congress.
particularly,
in
view
of
the
history
of
antitrust
legislation,
the
congress
passed
the
sherman
act
that
prohibits
or
restraints
a
trade
then
passed
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
prohibit
unfair
methods
of
competition.
but
when
they
came
to
clayton
act
and
more
particularly
to
the
robinson-patman
act
and
amended
it,
they
got
very
specific
and
they
dealt
with
specific
problems
in
specific
language.
and
2(d)
is
one
of
the
most
specific
of
all,
because
it
is
an
amendment
to
promotional
allowances
to
foresee
statute
limited
to
promotional
allowances.
so,
in
passing
2(d),
congress
didn't
give
a
three
formed
mandate
for
the
federal
trade
commission
to
cure
any
and
all
ills
that
they
might
find
to
exist
in
this
field.
for
example,
if
i
may
again
go
back
to
comparison
of
2(a)
and
2(d),
2
(a)
as
i
said
covered
primarily
line
as
a
cost
justification
proviso.
it
intended
to
save
the
economies
at
large
scale
buying
for
the
consumer,
and
it
had
many
passed
exhibit
which
2(d)
doesn't
view
at
all.
2(d)
is
considered
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
basically,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
correct
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
interpret
the
statute
differently
from
the
words
which
the
statute
used
which
is
‘competing
customers'.
you
spoke
of
the
general
legislative
intent
as
expressed
--
the
government
in
its
brief
--
the
referring
language
which
this
court
used
in
the
broch
case
which
you
would
paraphrase
in
your
question.
but
if
you
will
return
to
more
recent
sun
oil
case,
you
use
different
language.
this
court
used
different
language.
they
said,
i
quote,
“congress
intended
to
assure
that
businessmen
at
same
functional
level
would
start
on
equal
competitive
footings.”
so
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
intended
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
not
the
slightest
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
well,
the
court
of
appeals
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
the
court
said
that
if
these
retailers
who
buy
from
wholesalers
were
indirect
customers.
by
then,
they
would
be
required
--
the
supplier
would
give
a
proportion
on
his
balance
but
there
was
a
specific
finding
that
they
were
not
indirect
customers
in
the
sense
that
the
supplier
did
not
deal
directly
with
him.
so
--
well,
i
would
concede
the
robinson-patman
act's
general
purpose.
that's
in
fact
the
record
says,
still
they
use
specific
language
to
deal
with
specific
problems
and
i
think
the
problem
with
the
act
of
congress
do
not
strike
out
words
which
were
the
statute
namely
‘competing
customers'.
and
in
the
sun
oil
case,
just
decided
by
this
court
in
1963,
the
court
said
precisely
the
same
thing.
there,
the
government
was
contending
just
the
opposite
of
what
they
contend
now.
there
they
were
contending
that
you
couldn't
ignore
the
functional
levels.
you
will
recall
that
that
case
arose
under
2(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
permits
a
seller
to
be
competition.
and
there
this
court
held
that
the
defense
meeting
competition
was
not
available
to
a
gasoline
with
client
who
gave
lower
prices
to
the
service
station
customer
to
enable
to
meet
the
price
of
the
competitive
service
station
across
the
street.
there,
this
court
said
that
you
can't
expand
the
word
‘competition'
to
include
customers
at
different
functional
levels.
and
there
the
sun
oil
company
used
exactly
the
same
argument
which
the
government
uses
here
namely
that
the
buyer,
the
customer
in
that
service
station
was
just
conduit
to
the
consumer.
here,
the
government
says
to
the
wholesaler,
it
is
just
a
conduit
to
the
retailer.
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
as
i
recall
it
did
so
unanimously.
thus,
that
ends
the
discussion
of
my
first
proposition,
namely
that
statute
means
what
it
says
and
in
order
to
hold
otherwise,
with
respect
to
submit
to
this
court
would
have
to
strike
out
the
word
‘competing'
and
insert
the
word
‘engaged'.
now,
the
second
argument,
i
should
like
to
make
is
that
if
we
adopt
the
government
structure,
it
would
be
impossible
of
application.
now,
the
rationale,
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
there
is
no
compulsion
here
for
the
wholesaler
to
pass
it
on
profitable
on
how
they
--
but
the
rationale
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
should
be
passed
on
and
that
the
customer
of
the
wholesaler's
disadvantage
because
he's
a
small
retailer
and
he
doesn't
get
what
he
argued
competitively.
there
again,
i
said
the
robinson-patman
act
can't
cure
all
ills.
and
if
they
try
to
do
it
here,
let's
take
an
in-store
promotion
for
example.
the
commission
suggests
that
the
wholesaler
--
it's
just
$350
the
government
suggests
that
the
wholesaler
fragment
that
$350
and
proportionalize
payments
to
over
a
hundred
retailers.
$350
not
a
--
on
the
average
$350
but
i
supposed
the
wholesaler
would
have
to
try
to
do
it
to
buy
them
so
it
would
ascertain
the
dollar
volume
of
the
quantity
that
each
100
--
each
of
the
100
retailers
try
to
proportionalize
these
payments
so
that
can
get
down
to
almost
ridiculous
sum
of
maybe
a
dollar
here
and
maybe
$3
there
and
$5
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
well,
if
the
intent
of
the
act
is
proportionalize
based
on
dollar
volume
or
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
that's
the
theory
of
the
act.
but
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
the
government
as
--
i
mean
the
federal
trade
commission
and
its
order
hasn't
provided
the
retailer
to
get
it
and
the
government
in
its
brief
rejects
the
dissenting
opinion.
so
we're
placed
here
with
a
case
where
the
supplier
has
ordered
to
pay
it
to
the
wholesaler,
to
the
hope
that
you
passed
it
on.
but
still,
you
have
to
be
--
one
has
to
be
practical
i
think
in
this
commercial
world.
and
i
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
a
wholesaler
to
do
all
the
things
that
the
ftc
guide
require
him
to
do
with
these
hundred
retailers.
first,
you
have
to
go
and
find
out
which
one
of
them
actually
competes
with
the
direct
buying
retailer.
then
he
would
have
to
find
out
what
proportion
those
to
each
of
these,
and
i
say
it
would
be
a
rudimentary
portion.
then
he
has
to
ascertain
whether
the
plan
is
suitable
for
the
small
retailer
and
obviously
the
plan
involved
here
was
not
to
be
suitable
to
little
retailers
because
this
involve
a
coupon
book
promotion.
covering
four
weeks
time,
covering
in
store
--
and
a
small
retailer
who
buys
from
wholesaler
wouldn't
want
to
put
in
use
such
promotion.
so
this
wholesaler
would
have
to
go
to
each
of
the
800
customers
and
devise
an
alternative
plan
so
that
he
could
have
the
benefit
of
it
and
it
would
be
of
some
use.
then
he'd
have
to
collect
the
money
from
the
supplier,
passing
on
to
these
hundred
retailers.
you'd
have
to
see
that
it
was
actually
used
and
if
it
he
didn't
use
at
all,
he'd
have
to
see
that
he
did.
i
say
that
that's
impossible
on
application.
now,
the
government
recognizes
that
that
might
be
difficult
but
they
say
in
some
instances
in
advertising
for
example,
would
there
be
no
problem
because
the
wholesaler
could
do
the
advertising
for
the
retailer.
they
could
publish
the
ads
and
say,
go
to
so
and
so
retailer
and
get
direct
buyers
of
goods.
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
is,
that
every
or
universally
i
would
suggest,
the
advertisements
of
food
retailers
combined
product
and
price.
you
never
pick
up
an
ad
of
a
supermarket
and
just
see
meat
advertised,
you
see
the
price
under.
so
here,
you
would
have
the
wholesaler,
publishing
ad
for
hundred
retailers
giving
a
price.
they
couldn't
have
separate
ads
--
they'd
have
to
have
a
joint
or
a
common
ad.
so,
you
would
have
a
situation
i
would
suggest
where
you'd
have
a
direct
sherman
act
violation
suggested
by
the
government,
financed
by
the
supplier
and
managed
by
the
wholesaler.
and
that
it's
exactly
what
of
become
to
if
the
wholesaler
has
to
do
the
advertising
for
his
hundred
retailers.
well,
the
government
has
suggested
another
alternative
that
might
not
be
too
difficult.
they
suggest
as
i
take
it
has
been
suggested
here
this
afternoon
that
the
retailer
or
that
the
supplier
deal
directly
with
the
wholesaler's
retail
customers.
so
the
wholesaler
would
be
added
with
all
to
these.
so
now,
in
that
case,
their
deal
directly
may
become
under
the
decisions
an
indirect
customer.
therefore,
you
have
the
robinson-patman
act
questions
and
sherman
act
questions
raised.
the
supplier
would
have
to
police
and
supervise
the
wholesaler's
prices
to
these
hundred
retail
customers
to
see
that
they
were
not
discriminatory
among
themselves
and
perhaps
more
importantly
incomparable
with
supplier's
prices
to
the
direct
buying
retailer.
so
you'd
--
he'd
have
to
do
that
to
avoid
the
robinson-patman
act,
price
discrimination
law.
but
the
minute
he
polices
the
wholesaler's
prices,
he
engages
in
resale
price
maintenance.
so
i
suggest
there
again,
the
government
has
suggested
an
alternative
which
has
violative
of
two
other
laws.
and
in
the
impossibility
or
impractibility
of
the
commission's
order
is
even
more
apparent
when
you
would
apply
the
principle
to
a
more
complex
method
of
distribution
such
as
where
you
have
a
job
before
you
get
to
the
wholesaler.
there,
you'd
have
the
job
for
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
and
there
are
even
variations
of
that.
so
i
think
if
the
commission's
order
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
it
will
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
distribution
system
of
this
country.
it
will
either
put
the
wholesaler
out
of
business
or
can
go
away
with
promotion
allowances
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
i
don't
think
the
act
says
that
here.
i
think
it
says
the
competing
customers.
in
fact
it
does
say
that,
well
how
you
interpret
that,
well
it's
a
different
thing.
but
i
go
back
to
where
the
language
of
the
antitrust
field,
no
word
is
more
used
or
more
understood
than
the
word
‘competition'.
and
you
can
search
every
picture
in
or
look
at
every
antitrust
opinion
that
i've
ever
seen
and
the
word
‘competition'
refers
to
competitors
who
buy
or
a
customer
or
business
of
the
same
third
person.
now,
if
you
just
want
to
forget
the
functional
system,
why
--
you
could
do
it
but
it
certainly
is
a
concept
which
i
think
shakes
the
foundations
of
the
distribution
work.
i
think
i've
covered
the
two
propositions
i
started
to
discuss
and
since
i
have
a
minute
left,
i
would
like
to
add
the
third
argument.
and
that
is
that
this
issue
that
is
before
this
court
was
not
tried.
for
25
years,
the
commissions
and
the
courts
had
held
that
you
didn't
have
to
proportionalize
promotion
allowances
as
between
retailers
and
wholesalers.
in
fact,
when
the
hearing
were
going
on
in
this
case,
the
commission
decided
to
link
meyers
to
back
up
case
and
then
repeat
what
it
had
held
before
that
proportionalization
was
required
only
among
customers
competing
at
the
same
functional
level.
and
then
when
this
case
came
up,
they
expressly
reversed
meyers
and
held
the
contrary.
so,
the
issue
was
not
post
in
the
complaint,
it
was
not
tried,
no
evidence
was
submitted
on
the
issue,
the
--
it
was
assumed
once
you
showed
there
wholesalers
that
they
didn't
--
that
was
an
absolute
defense
that
isn't
covered
within
2(d).
now,
of
course
the
commission
has
the
right
to
reverse
itself
as
the
courts
would
like
to
do.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they're
going
to
do
it
at
the
very
minimum,
it
should
be
--
minimum
of
course,
it
should
be
followed
would
be
to
wait
until
the
case
comes
up
where
the
issue
is
posed
by
the
pleading.
the
evidence
is
introduced
and
the
case
is
decided
in
broad
daylight
and
not
by
just
a
change
of
law
based
on
a
record
which
merits
on
all
the
things
i've
talked
about
exactly.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
administer
because
it
wasn't
an
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
discuss
two
propositions.
first,
that
the
statute
involved
here
namely
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
means
exactly
what
it
says.
and
when
that
refers
to
competing
customers,
it
refers
to
competitors
who
compete
with
each
other
and
who
buy
for
a
business
of
the
same
third
person.
in
other
words,
the
customers
who
compete
at
the
same
functional
level,
and
secondly,
that
the
government's
construction
requiring
proportional
payments
to
wholesalers
with
the
hope
that
the
wholesaler
will
pass
it
on
to
the
retailers
is
administrative
and
practical,
and
impossible
application
in
the
day-to-day,
early-burley
commercial
work.
first,
the
government
tries
to
analogize
2(d)
to
2(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
i
may
say
that
since
2(a),
a
more
solved
case,
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
whether,
it
does
refer
to
promotional
allowances
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
between
direct
buying
retailers
and
wholesalers
whose
customers
compete
with
direct
buying
retailer
that
2(d)
should
be
construed
the
same
way.
and
now
the
difficulty
here
is
that
2(d)
is
entirely
different
statute
from
2(a),
has
entirely
differently
language.
2(a)
for
example,
prohibits
the
price
discrimination
which
may
injure
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants
or
receives
the
benefit
of
the
discrimination
or
with
customers
of
either
of
that.
it
covers
the
primary
line,
secondary
line
and
the
so-called
tertiary
line.
the
2(d)
doesn't
contain
language
that
even
resembles
them.
2(d)
simply
prohibits
non-proportional
promotional
allowances
only
as
between
“customers
competing”
in
the
distribution
of
the
particular
product.
now,
the
government
argues
in
effect
that
the
word
distribution
as
used
in
section
2(d),
negates
or
at
least
modifies
the
word
‘competing'.
so
as
to
give
the
word
‘competing'
or
‘competition'
an
entirely
different
meaning
of
the
dictionary
or
from
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
the
word,
particularly
in
the
antitrust
field.
in
other
words,
the
government
rewrites
the
statute,
strikes
out
the
words
competing
customers
and
inserts
the
words
engaged
in,
so
as
to
prohibit
non-proportional
payments
to
anyone
engaged
in
the
distribution
of
the
product.
now,
we
think
such
rewriting
the
statute
should
be
left
with
the
congress.
particularly,
in
view
of
the
history
of
antitrust
legislation,
the
congress
passed
the
sherman
act
that
prohibits
or
restraints
a
trade
then
passed
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
prohibit
unfair
methods
of
competition.
but
when
they
came
to
clayton
act
and
more
particularly
to
the
robinson-patman
act
and
amended
it,
they
got
very
specific
and
they
dealt
with
specific
problems
in
specific
language.
and
2(d)
is
one
of
the
most
specific
of
all,
because
it
is
an
amendment
to
promotional
allowances
to
foresee
statute
limited
to
promotional
allowances.
so,
in
passing
2(d),
congress
didn't
give
a
three
formed
mandate
for
the
federal
trade
commission
to
cure
any
and
all
ills
that
they
might
find
to
exist
in
this
field.
for
example,
if
i
may
again
go
back
to
comparison
of
2(a)
and
2(d),
2
(a)
as
i
said
covered
primarily
line
as
a
cost
justification
proviso.
it
intended
to
save
the
economies
at
large
scale
buying
for
the
consumer,
and
it
had
many
passed
exhibit
which
2(d)
doesn't
view
at
all.
2(d)
is
considered
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
basically,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
correct
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
interpret
the
statute
differently
from
the
words
which
the
statute
used
which
is
‘competing
customers'.
you
spoke
of
the
general
legislative
intent
as
expressed
--
the
government
in
its
brief
--
the
referring
language
which
this
court
used
in
the
broch
case
which
you
would
paraphrase
in
your
question.
but
if
you
will
return
to
more
recent
sun
oil
case,
you
use
different
language.
this
court
used
different
language.
they
said,
i
quote,
“congress
intended
to
assure
that
businessmen
at
same
functional
level
would
start
on
equal
competitive
footings.”
so
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
intended
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
not
the
slightest
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
well,
the
court
of
appeals
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
the
court
said
that
if
these
retailers
who
buy
from
wholesalers
were
indirect
customers.
by
then,
they
would
be
required
--
the
supplier
would
give
a
proportion
on
his
balance
but
there
was
a
specific
finding
that
they
were
not
indirect
customers
in
the
sense
that
the
supplier
did
not
deal
directly
with
him.
so
--
well,
i
would
concede
the
robinson-patman
act's
general
purpose.
that's
in
fact
the
record
says,
still
they
use
specific
language
to
deal
with
specific
problems
and
i
think
the
problem
with
the
act
of
congress
do
not
strike
out
words
which
were
the
statute
namely
‘competing
customers'.
and
in
the
sun
oil
case,
just
decided
by
this
court
in
1963,
the
court
said
precisely
the
same
thing.
there,
the
government
was
contending
just
the
opposite
of
what
they
contend
now.
there
they
were
contending
that
you
couldn't
ignore
the
functional
levels.
you
will
recall
that
that
case
arose
under
2(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
permits
a
seller
to
be
competition.
and
there
this
court
held
that
the
defense
meeting
competition
was
not
available
to
a
gasoline
with
client
who
gave
lower
prices
to
the
service
station
customer
to
enable
to
meet
the
price
of
the
competitive
service
station
across
the
street.
there,
this
court
said
that
you
can't
expand
the
word
‘competition'
to
include
customers
at
different
functional
levels.
and
there
the
sun
oil
company
used
exactly
the
same
argument
which
the
government
uses
here
namely
that
the
buyer,
the
customer
in
that
service
station
was
just
conduit
to
the
consumer.
here,
the
government
says
to
the
wholesaler,
it
is
just
a
conduit
to
the
retailer.
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
as
i
recall
it
did
so
unanimously.
thus,
that
ends
the
discussion
of
my
first
proposition,
namely
that
statute
means
what
it
says
and
in
order
to
hold
otherwise,
with
respect
to
submit
to
this
court
would
have
to
strike
out
the
word
‘competing'
and
insert
the
word
‘engaged'.
now,
the
second
argument,
i
should
like
to
make
is
that
if
we
adopt
the
government
structure,
it
would
be
impossible
of
application.
now,
the
rationale,
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
there
is
no
compulsion
here
for
the
wholesaler
to
pass
it
on
profitable
on
how
they
--
but
the
rationale
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
should
be
passed
on
and
that
the
customer
of
the
wholesaler's
disadvantage
because
he's
a
small
retailer
and
he
doesn't
get
what
he
argued
competitively.
there
again,
i
said
the
robinson-patman
act
can't
cure
all
ills.
and
if
they
try
to
do
it
here,
let's
take
an
in-store
promotion
for
example.
the
commission
suggests
that
the
wholesaler
--
it's
just
$350
the
government
suggests
that
the
wholesaler
fragment
that
$350
and
proportionalize
payments
to
over
a
hundred
retailers.
$350
not
a
--
on
the
average
$350
but
i
supposed
the
wholesaler
would
have
to
try
to
do
it
to
buy
them
so
it
would
ascertain
the
dollar
volume
of
the
quantity
that
each
100
--
each
of
the
100
retailers
try
to
proportionalize
these
payments
so
that
can
get
down
to
almost
ridiculous
sum
of
maybe
a
dollar
here
and
maybe
$3
there
and
$5
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
well,
if
the
intent
of
the
act
is
proportionalize
based
on
dollar
volume
or
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
that's
the
theory
of
the
act.
but
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
the
government
as
--
i
mean
the
federal
trade
commission
and
its
order
hasn't
provided
the
retailer
to
get
it
and
the
government
in
its
brief
rejects
the
dissenting
opinion.
so
we're
placed
here
with
a
case
where
the
supplier
has
ordered
to
pay
it
to
the
wholesaler,
to
the
hope
that
you
passed
it
on.
but
still,
you
have
to
be
--
one
has
to
be
practical
i
think
in
this
commercial
world.
and
i
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
a
wholesaler
to
do
all
the
things
that
the
ftc
guide
require
him
to
do
with
these
hundred
retailers.
first,
you
have
to
go
and
find
out
which
one
of
them
actually
competes
with
the
direct
buying
retailer.
then
he
would
have
to
find
out
what
proportion
those
to
each
of
these,
and
i
say
it
would
be
a
rudimentary
portion.
then
he
has
to
ascertain
whether
the
plan
is
suitable
for
the
small
retailer
and
obviously
the
plan
involved
here
was
not
to
be
suitable
to
little
retailers
because
this
involve
a
coupon
book
promotion.
covering
four
weeks
time,
covering
in
store
--
and
a
small
retailer
who
buys
from
wholesaler
wouldn't
want
to
put
in
use
such
promotion.
so
this
wholesaler
would
have
to
go
to
each
of
the
800
customers
and
devise
an
alternative
plan
so
that
he
could
have
the
benefit
of
it
and
it
would
be
of
some
use.
then
he'd
have
to
collect
the
money
from
the
supplier,
passing
on
to
these
hundred
retailers.
you'd
have
to
see
that
it
was
actually
used
and
if
it
he
didn't
use
at
all,
he'd
have
to
see
that
he
did.
i
say
that
that's
impossible
on
application.
now,
the
government
recognizes
that
that
might
be
difficult
but
they
say
in
some
instances
in
advertising
for
example,
would
there
be
no
problem
because
the
wholesaler
could
do
the
advertising
for
the
retailer.
they
could
publish
the
ads
and
say,
go
to
so
and
so
retailer
and
get
direct
buyers
of
goods.
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
is,
that
every
or
universally
i
would
suggest,
the
advertisements
of
food
retailers
combined
product
and
price.
you
never
pick
up
an
ad
of
a
supermarket
and
just
see
meat
advertised,
you
see
the
price
under.
so
here,
you
would
have
the
wholesaler,
publishing
ad
for
hundred
retailers
giving
a
price.
they
couldn't
have
separate
ads
--
they'd
have
to
have
a
joint
or
a
common
ad.
so,
you
would
have
a
situation
i
would
suggest
where
you'd
have
a
direct
sherman
act
violation
suggested
by
the
government,
financed
by
the
supplier
and
managed
by
the
wholesaler.
and
that
it's
exactly
what
of
become
to
if
the
wholesaler
has
to
do
the
advertising
for
his
hundred
retailers.
well,
the
government
has
suggested
another
alternative
that
might
not
be
too
difficult.
they
suggest
as
i
take
it
has
been
suggested
here
this
afternoon
that
the
retailer
or
that
the
supplier
deal
directly
with
the
wholesaler's
retail
customers.
so
the
wholesaler
would
be
added
with
all
to
these.
so
now,
in
that
case,
their
deal
directly
may
become
under
the
decisions
an
indirect
customer.
therefore,
you
have
the
robinson-patman
act
questions
and
sherman
act
questions
raised.
the
supplier
would
have
to
police
and
supervise
the
wholesaler's
prices
to
these
hundred
retail
customers
to
see
that
they
were
not
discriminatory
among
themselves
and
perhaps
more
importantly
incomparable
with
supplier's
prices
to
the
direct
buying
retailer.
so
you'd
--
he'd
have
to
do
that
to
avoid
the
robinson-patman
act,
price
discrimination
law.
but
the
minute
he
polices
the
wholesaler's
prices,
he
engages
in
resale
price
maintenance.
so
i
suggest
there
again,
the
government
has
suggested
an
alternative
which
has
violative
of
two
other
laws.
and
in
the
impossibility
or
impractibility
of
the
commission's
order
is
even
more
apparent
when
you
would
apply
the
principle
to
a
more
complex
method
of
distribution
such
as
where
you
have
a
job
before
you
get
to
the
wholesaler.
there,
you'd
have
the
job
for
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
and
there
are
even
variations
of
that.
so
i
think
if
the
commission's
order
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
it
will
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
distribution
system
of
this
country.
it
will
either
put
the
wholesaler
out
of
business
or
can
go
away
with
promotion
allowances
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
f.
howrey
i
don't
think
the
act
says
that
here.
i
think
it
says
the
competing
customers.
in
fact
it
does
say
that,
well
how
you
interpret
that,
well
it's
a
different
thing.
but
i
go
back
to
where
the
language
of
the
antitrust
field,
no
word
is
more
used
or
more
understood
than
the
word
‘competition'.
and
you
can
search
every
picture
in
or
look
at
every
antitrust
opinion
that
i've
ever
seen
and
the
word
‘competition'
refers
to
competitors
who
buy
or
a
customer
or
business
of
the
same
third
person.
now,
if
you
just
want
to
forget
the
functional
system,
why
--
you
could
do
it
but
it
certainly
is
a
concept
which
i
think
shakes
the
foundations
of
the
distribution
work.
i
think
i've
covered
the
two
propositions
i
started
to
discuss
and
since
i
have
a
minute
left,
i
would
like
to
add
the
third
argument.
and
that
is
that
this
issue
that
is
before
this
court
was
not
tried.
for
25
years,
the
commissions
and
the
courts
had
held
that
you
didn't
have
to
proportionalize
promotion
allowances
as
between
retailers
and
wholesalers.
in
fact,
when
the
hearing
were
going
on
in
this
case,
the
commission
decided
to
link
meyers
to
back
up
case
and
then
repeat
what
it
had
held
before
that
proportionalization
was
required
only
among
customers
competing
at
the
same
functional
level.
and
then
when
this
case
came
up,
they
expressly
reversed
meyers
and
held
the
contrary.
so,
the
issue
was
not
post
in
the
complaint,
it
was
not
tried,
no
evidence
was
submitted
on
the
issue,
the
--
it
was
assumed
once
you
showed
there
wholesalers
that
they
didn't
--
that
was
an
absolute
defense
that
isn't
covered
within
2(d).
now,
of
course
the
commission
has
the
right
to
reverse
itself
as
the
courts
would
like
to
do.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they're
going
to
do
it
at
the
very
minimum,
it
should
be
--
minimum
of
course,
it
should
be
followed
would
be
to
wait
until
the
case
comes
up
where
the
issue
is
posed
by
the
pleading.
the
evidence
is
introduced
and
the
case
is
decided
in
broad
daylight
and
not
by
just
a
change
of
law
based
on
a
record
which
merits
on
all
the
things
i've
talked
about
exactly.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
administer
because
it
wasn't
an
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
