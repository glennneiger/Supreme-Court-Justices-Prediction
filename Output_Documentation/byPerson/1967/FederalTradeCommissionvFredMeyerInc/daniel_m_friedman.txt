mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
--
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
presents
an
important
question
under
section
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
section
prohibits
a
seller
from
giving
a
promotional
allowance
for
a
customer
unless
he
makes
that
promotional
allowance
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
all
other
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods
involved
in
this
allowance.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
seller
violates
that
provision.
when
he
makes
a
--
gives
a
proportional
allowance
to
a
retailer
who
buys
directly
from
him
but
refuses
to
make
the
allowance
available
to
wholesalers
whose
own
retail
customers
compete
with
the
direct
buying
retail
or
to
put
the
question
a
little
differently
within
the
statutory
term,
the
question
is
whether
those
circumstances
that
this
private
wholesaler
is
a
customer
competing
in
the
distribution
of
goods.
the
case
comes
before
this
court
in
a
somewhat
unusual
factual
posture
and
that
the
respondent,
fred
meyer
is
not
the
supplier
who
was
given
the
discriminatory
promotional
allowance
but
the
purchaser
who
has
received.
the
commission
on
this
case
found,
that
the
respondent
had
violated
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
by
knowingly
inducing
a
discriminatory
promotional
allowance
that
violated
section
2(d).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
issue
under
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
because
the
validity
of
the
commission,
section
5
violation
directly
depend
on
whether
the
giving
of
this
allowance
violated
section
2(d).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
make
no
contention
that
there's
any
violation
to
section
5,
unless
there
is
a
violation
by
the
seller
of
section
2(d).
now,
the
facts
that
are
in
dispute
are
relatively
simple.
the
respondent
operates
a
chain
of
13
supermarkets
in
the
portland,
oregon
area
in
which
it
sells
groceries,
some
clothing
items,
drugs
and
various
miscellaneous
goods.
it's
a
large
firm.
its
sales
in
1957,
one
of
the
two
years
involved
in
this
case
totaled
more
than
$40
million.
and
it
also
is
the
second
largest
seller
of
goods
in
the
area.
the
commission's
case,
the
discriminatory
allowances
involved
here,
turned
primarily
upon
certain
things
that
was
done
by
the
respondent
in
connection
with
an
annual
promotion
plan
that
runs
a
so-called
“coupon
book
promotion”.
since
1936,
each
for
four
weeks,
the
respondent
has
conducted
this
coupon
book
promotion.
i
have
here
from
the
record
just
to
be
wise
with
the
purposes
of
one
of
the
coupon
books.
this
is
a
little
book
which
the
respondent
sells
to
its
customers
for
$0.10.
it
contains
72
pages.
each
pages
of
coupon
advertising
a
particular
product,
i
just
open
this
at
random
coupon
worth
$0.56,
amends
a
100%
(inaudible)
regularly
up
to
a
$1.25
a
pair,
$0.69
a
pair.
and
72
different
products
are
involved
and
in
each
instance,
the
customer
takes
the
coupon,
turns
the
coupon
in
and
gets
some
bargain.
this
has
been
a
rather
substantial
campaign
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
and
the
two
years
involved
approximately
a
sale
of
$140,000
in
one
year,
a
$120,000
in
the
other
year.
the
respondent
finances
the
coupon
book
based
at
the
actual
production
of
the
book,
by
charging
each
supplier
$350
for
it's
own
advertising
in
the
coupon.
and
the
total
of
cost,
the
total
amount
received,
the
72
coupons
times
$350
approximates
the
cost
to
respondent
in
producing
the
book.
now,
in
addition
to
the
$350,
the
respondent
has
also
received
from
a
number
of
the
suppliers
various
other
concessions,
relating
to
the
fact
that
under
the
plan,
they
sell
the
goods
for
less
than
the
regular
price.
in
some
instances,
for
example,
they've
gotten
three
goods
from
the
supplier.
in
other
instances,
the
supplier
has
given
them
discounts
on
the
price
of
goods.
and
in
other
instances,
the
supplier
has
redeemed
coupons.
it's
conceded,
no
one
questions
that
the
initiative
for
this
program
came
from
the
respondent.
that
these
suppliers
did
not
come
to
fred
meyer
and
suggest
it;
fred
meyer
demanded
it
from
the
suppliers
and
fred
meyer
was
moving
forth
in
obtaining
these
allowances.
after
a
full-hearing,
the
federal
trade
commission
found
that
the
first
$350,
that
is
the
amount
paid
for
the
book,
constituted
a
promotional
allowance
that
was
illegal
under
section
2(d)
because
it's
not
made
available
to
all
competing
customers.
and
that
the
remaining
amount
of
the
benefit
that
is
the
free
goods,
the
redemption
of
the
coupons
and
the
discounts
constituted
price
discrimination
illegal
under
section
2(a)
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
commission
further
held
that
fred
meyer
had
knowingly
induced
these
discriminatory
allowances
in
violation
of
section
2(f)
of
the
act
that
being
the
provision
prohibiting
the
illegal
inducement
of
price
discrimination
and
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
that
relating
to
the
allowances
involved
in
this
case.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
the
finding
that
there
was
an
illegal
promotional
allowance
involved
by
the
sellers
of
this
case
rested
in
part
on
the
fact
that
two
of
the
wholesalers
to
whom
these
allowances
were
denied
had
customers
who
competed
at
retail
in
selling
with
fred
meyer.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
commission
in
two
respects.
it
agreed
with
the
commission
that
fred
meyer
had
knowingly
induced
illegal
price
discrimination.
it
also
agreed
with
the
commission
that
the
respondent
had
knowingly
induced
discriminatory
allowances
not
made
available
to
other
wholesalers.
there
were
two
other
wholesalers
in
the
area
--
i'm
sorry,
excuse
me
--
there
are
two
other
large
retailers
in
the
area.
it
agreed
that
the
failure
to
make
the
allowance
available
to
the
other
large
retailer
has
violated
the
act.
the
court
held,
however,
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
predicating
a
violation
on
the
fact
that
the
suppliers
had
not
made
the
allowances
available
to
the
wholesalers
whose
customers
competed
with
the
direct
buy
and
retail.
because
in
its
view,
section
2(d)
only
pertains
to
customers
who
compete
at
the
same
functional
level,
that
is
retailer
against
retailer,
wholesaler
against
wholesaler,
but
not
retailer
as
against
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete
with
the
retailer.
and
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
struck
from
the
commission's
order,
a
provision
which
prohibited
the
respondent
from
knowingly
inducing
discriminatory
allowances
that
were
not
made
available
to
wholesaler
whose
customers
competed
with
fred
meyer.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
statute
which
was
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
prohibits
a
seller
from
giving
proportional
allowances
unless
they
have
made
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
all
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
goods.
and
they
think
the
purpose
of
this
prohibition
is
very
clear.
it
is
to
prevent
a
supplier
from
subsidizing
the
promotional
and
advertising
activities
of
a
particular
customer
unless
he
makes
the
same
benefit
available
to
those
who
will
likely
to
be
injured
by
this
type
of
favoritism.
that
is
to
the
other
people
competing
in
the
distribution
of
these
goods
to
the
public.
the
promotional
allowances
of
this
type,
allowing
a
man
--
giving
a
man
$500
because
he
performs
certain
services
in
connection
to
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
good
is
to
put
really
just
an
indirect
form
of
the
broader
prohibition
of
the
robinson-patman
act
against
price
discrimination.
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
frequently
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
to
prevent
a
large
buyer
from
getting
these
discriminatory
advantages
over
his
smaller
competitors
as
a
result
of
his
superior
purchasing
power.
in
this
case,
it's
clear
that
the
respondent
is
a
large
buyer
that
it
took
the
initiative
and
that
actually
now
come
to
the
point
that
the
effect
of
this
arrangement
was
to
give
at
a
very
significant
advantage
over
the
smaller
retailers
in
the
area
who
competed
with
him.
the
injury
that
a
small
retailer
suffers,
when
his
wholesaler
is
denied
of
promotional
allowance
of
this
type
is
basically
the
same
as
if
the
small
retailer
was
purchasing
directly
from
the
supplier
and
the
discrimination
was
made
available
to
one
but
not
to
the
other.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
his
injury
is
that
he
doesn't
get
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
the
--
it
requires
him
to
make
it
available
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry,
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler,
but
we
think
that
this
is
basically
what
the
statute
contemplates,
that
what
is
likely
to
happen
in
this
case
as
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
is
very
much
going
to
be
the
interest
of
the
wholesaler
to
see
to
it
that
these
allowances
that
are
--
have
been
given
to
the
large
retailers
will
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
he
could
not
do
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
he
could
not
do
under
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
because
under
--
this
might
consist
of
a
violation
of
either
section
2(f),
the
receipt
of
an
illegal
price
discrimination
or
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
take
it
a
little
--
let's
go
back
a
minute.
under
the
statute,
the
requirement
is
that
the
seller
must
make
the
allowance
available
to
all
of
these
competing
customers.
it's
up
to
the
customer
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
take
the
allowance.
but
if
he
likes
to
take
the
allowance,
then
he
has
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
is
provided.
that
is
to
make
it
available,
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
that
is
for
example
as
an
advertising
allowance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
difficult
argument
or
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
method
of
competition,
mr.
justice,
for
the
wholesaler
to
take
this
allowance
given
to
him
because
it's
necessary
to
ensure
competitive
equality
between
the
distribution
system
on
one
hand
involving
the
wholesalers
and
retailers
as
we
say
and
the
other
cases
which
buying
retail
and
thus
--
and
then
just
put
it
in
the
pocket.
he
has
taken
the
money
for
one
purpose,
he's
taken
it
to
the
purpose
of
ensuring
competitive
equality
and
injured
him
to
another
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
in
this
--
he
would.
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
found
that
there
were
a
large
number
or
in
fact
virtually
all
of
the
customers
in
the
city
of
portland
to
be
wholesalers
were
competing.
fred
meyer
has
advertised
to
the
state
that
it
has
a
supermarket
in
every
part
of
the
town.
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
two
wholesalers,
one
had
i
think
hundred
retail
customers
and
the
other
had
40
retail
customers.
there
is
a
testimony
by
some
of
them
at
least
but
they
did
directly
compete
with
fred
meyer's
stores.
he
would
have
to
--
he
would
have
to
make
it
available.
now,
what
we
give
as
an
example
in
this
particular
case,
what
was
involved
was
a
promotional
allowance.
that
is
a
giving
of
money
for
this
particular
form
of
promotion
if
some
of
the
suppliers
--
if
they
would,
some
of
the
suppliers
which
of
this
type
of
promotion
would
have
to
make
it
available.
on
the
other
hand,
there
may
be
equivalent
forms
of
promotion
that
would
be
available
for
some
of
these
smaller
retailers.
now,
it
doesn't
have
to
--
they
don't
have
to
make
the
allowance
available
for
the
exact
same
thing
that
was
given
to
the
one
say
the
customers.
they
have
to
give
them
comparable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
is
this
difference
--
i
think
there
is
a
basic
difference.
commissioner
elman
would
say,
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
retailer
is
a
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
would
have
to.
but
commissioner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
that
under
commissioner
elman's
theory,
the
wholesaler
would
have
no
discretion
whether
to
accept
it
or
not.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
commissioner
elman's
theory,
he
says
that
what
the
supplier
should
do
is
go
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
wholesaler
--
the
wholesaler
can
decide
where
he
wants
to
make
it
available
to
the
retailers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
that
sense,
yes.
but
it's
very
much
to
the
wholesalers
interest
we
think
that
accept
these
allowances
because
these
allowances
to
be
passed
on
to
the
retailers,
are
obviously
going
to
read
down
to
the
benefit
of
the
retailers.
they're
going
to
increase
the
retailer's
sales.
and
this
in
turn
will
directly
increase
the
wholesaler's
sales.
so
we
think
as
a
matter
of
self-interest,
the
wholesaler
will
be
very
anxious
to
receive
these
promotional
allowances.
now,
there
are
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
the
anomalies
and
rather
inconsistent
results
of
flow
from
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
statute,
both
of
which
the
commission
refers
to.
in
the
first
instance,
let's
assume
the
market
where
there
are
two
large
chains.
both
of
whom
buy
directly
from
a
supplier.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
a
wholesaler
in
the
market
who
supplies
all
of
the
existing
small
retailers.
the
--
under
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation,
if
the
seller
gives
one
of
these
allowances
to
a
chain,
one
of
the
chains,
it
is
required
to
make
it
available
to
the
other
chain.
yet
at
the
same
time,
it
is
not
required
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler.
but
this
means
basically,
that
the
firm
best
able
to
protect
itself
because
of
its
economic
power,
the
second
chain
gets
the
benefit
of
this
action.
whereas
the
people
who
least
able
in
the
long
run,
the
wholesalers
do
not
get
the
benefit
of
this
thing.
that
is
the
people
least
able
to
protect
themselves.
the
people
who
need
the
protection
of
the
statute
most
are
denied
that
right.
now,
the
statute
uses
the
words
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods.
and
we
think
in
the
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
what
this
means
is,
it's
seeking
to
protect
the
entire
distribution
process
by
which
goods
flow
from
the
supplier
through
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
now,
the
wholesaler
we
think,
in
this
light
of
this
purpose
make
fairly
be
viewed
as
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods.
because
he,
together
with
retailers
form
a
conduit,
form
a
distribution
unit
by
which
the
goods
are
distributed.
the
direct
buying
retailer
in
this
kind
of
a
case
basically
combines
the
function
of
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
in
a
single
entity.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
protect
here,
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
being
powerful
buying
organization,
bringing
their
power
to
bear
in
getting
advantage
is
not
available
to
the
small
merchant
which
is
necessary
to
accomplish
this
protection.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
to
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
justice.
i
would
not
have
any
difficulty
with
that
argument.
i
think
the
commission
would
because
the
commission
has
always
said
that
for
the
retailer
to
be
viewed
as
an
indirect
customer
there
has
to
be
something
more
in
a
way
of
a
connection
from
the
supplier
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
we
have
no
assurance
any
more
than
we
have
assurance
that
if
one
of
these
allowances
has
made
available
to
someone
who
is
directly
competing,
that
he
will
accept
it.
i
mean
anyone
of
course
is
free
project
and
allowed.
but
it
seems
to
us
there
are
a
couple
of
considerations
which
indicate
that
the
wholesalers
will
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
allowance.
one
thing
as
i
suggest,
it's
just
in
their
self-interest
because
this
allowance
rids
down
to
the
benefit
of
a
customer
it
seems
to
us,
it
will
be
to
the
benefit
into
the
advantage
of
the
wholesaler
to
take
little
steps
that
will
facilitate
increasing
the
benefit
of
its
customers.
then
another
suggestion
we
make
in
our
brief
is
that
if
you
have
a
market
with
more
than
one
wholesaler,
one
wholesaler
is
giving
this
advantage
to
his
customers
and
it
seems
to
be
it
won't
be
long
before
the
other
customer
will
be
coerced
to
do
so.
it
just
seems
to
us
that
while
you
--
you
can't
force
the
horse
to
drink
but
at
least
give
him
a
chance
to
get
to
the
water.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
basically
is
that
this
may
not
be
a
perfect
solution
to
the
problem.
but
that
this
at
least
facilitates
it.
in
other
words,
at
least
the
retailer
should
have
the
opportunity
to
get
to
the
benefit
of
having
his
wholesaler
in
the
position
to
pass
these
things
on
to
him.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
one
other
anomalous
result
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
which
is
this.
under
the
price
discrimination
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
is
section
2(a),
it
has
long
been
viewed
as
subtle
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
morton
salt
case,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
section
2(a)
if
a
seller
discriminates
in
price
between
a
direct
buying
retailer
and
a
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete
with
that
direct
buying
retailer.
now,
since
these
discriminatory
promotional
allowances
are
about
one
form
of
the
larger
species
of
price
discrimination
condemned
in
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us
it'd
be
most
anomalous
to
say,
that
if
a
seller
engages
in
the
direct
form
of
price
discrimination,
that
is
he
actually
gives
a
price
discrimination
to
a
direct
buying
retailer
but
refuses
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete,
he's
violated
the
law.
yet,
if
he
does
it
through
the
device
of
a
promotional
allowance,
the
benefits
are
not
available
to
the
direct
buying
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
do
not
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
we
would
not
call
an
indirect
purchaser
unless
there
was
some
direct
relationship
between
the
seller
and
the
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2(a)
says
purchasers
or
customers
of
purchasers.
if
the
2(a)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2(a)
--
now
they
rely
--
they
rely
upon
--
our
opponents
rely
on
that
distinction
in
the
language.
they
say,
you
can't
fairly
compare
the
two
because
2(a)
in
terms
speaks
discrimination,
the
effect
of
which
maybe
the
less
in
competition
with
the
seller
or
the
customers
of
the
people
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
discrimination.
we
suggest
that
that
is
no
ground
of
distinction
for
two
reasons.
first,
in
terms
of
the
basic
policy,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
and
secondly,
that
provision
as
we
read
that
merely
indicates
what
the
commission
has
to
show
in
order
to
establish
a
violation.
that
is
it
defines
the
kind
of
showing
of
competitive
injury
the
commission
must
make
in
order
to
establish
the
violation.
and
congress
has
--
in
dealing
with
section
2(d),
the
discriminatory
allowances
provision
has
imposed
a
per
se
rule.
it
is
limited
--
eliminated.
this
is
the
need
of
showing
injury
to
competition
or
it
has
also
eliminated
the
coerced
justification
provision
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
read
the
strange
rule
to
suggest
that
what
congress
has
made
a
strict
provision
in
dealing
with
promotional
allowances
than
in
dealing
with
coerced
direct
price
discriminations
that
a
seller
may
do
--
may
accomplish
as
a
discriminatory
allowance
but
he's
prohibited
from
doing
as
a
price
discrimination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice,
he
has
to
pass
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice
that
he
would
be
obligated
to
pass
it
on
to
his
retail
customers
in
the
same
basis
which
he
got
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
to
think
about
it
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
point
that
mr.
howrey
has
just
made
that
this
issue
was
not
adequately
presented
to
the
commission.
i'd
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
pages
107
to
113
of
the
record,
the
commission's
opinion
on
the
exceptions
to
the
proposed
form
of
order
in
which
the
commission
points
out
that
all
of
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
were
fully
litigated.
the
respondents
were
unnoticed
in
this
case
when
the
commission
counsel
began
putting
in
its
quote
that
the
commission
was
treating
wholesalers
as
the
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
because
they
introduced
a
lot
of
evidence
dealing
with
that.
and
of
course,
in
the
issue
under
the
price
fixing
section
of
the
complaint,
2(a),
2(f)
charge.
of
course
under
a
central
line
of
authority
that
particular
issue
was
opened
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
--
whether
the
wholesalers
had
retail
customers
who
were
competing.
the
only
thing
that
was
not
litigated
during
the
course
of
the
initial
commission
hearing
was
the
legal
issue.
the
legal
issue
whether
under
section
2(d),
the
wholesalers
need
circumstances
that
were
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
goods
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
that
issue
was
fully
argued
by
the
respondent
in
the
exceptions
to
the
proposed
order
which
for
the
first
time,
specifically
dealt
with
this
issue
and
the
commission
analyzed
the
problem
and
disposed
of
it
in
its
opinion.
so
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
of
the
claim
which
is
now
asserted
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
adequate
to
dispose
off
the
issue.
the
suggestion
that
all
of
the
contentions
to
which
mr.
howrey
eludes
that
there
was
no
record
evidence
upon
which
that
could
be
based,
this
symbolized
the
kind
of
factual
economic
arguments
that
are
always
in
advance
to
justify
a
particular
construction
of
the
statute.
it
was
never
suggested
by
the
respondent
in
the
exceptions
before
the
commission
on
the
form
of
the
order
that
the
record
was
inadequate
to
permit
a
judgment,
a
determination
of
this
issue.
the
argument
was
that
the
commission
was
wrong
as
in
the
matter
of
law.
so
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
this,
we
think
that
this
record
thus
fully
presents
all
the
evidence
necessary
and
if
the
case
is
inappropriate
posture
for
this
court
to
decide.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
--
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
presents
an
important
question
under
section
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
section
prohibits
a
seller
from
giving
a
promotional
allowance
for
a
customer
unless
he
makes
that
promotional
allowance
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
all
other
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods
involved
in
this
allowance.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
seller
violates
that
provision.
when
he
makes
a
--
gives
a
proportional
allowance
to
a
retailer
who
buys
directly
from
him
but
refuses
to
make
the
allowance
available
to
wholesalers
whose
own
retail
customers
compete
with
the
direct
buying
retail
or
to
put
the
question
a
little
differently
within
the
statutory
term,
the
question
is
whether
those
circumstances
that
this
private
wholesaler
is
a
customer
competing
in
the
distribution
of
goods.
the
case
comes
before
this
court
in
a
somewhat
unusual
factual
posture
and
that
the
respondent,
fred
meyer
is
not
the
supplier
who
was
given
the
discriminatory
promotional
allowance
but
the
purchaser
who
has
received.
the
commission
on
this
case
found,
that
the
respondent
had
violated
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
by
knowingly
inducing
a
discriminatory
promotional
allowance
that
violated
section
2(d).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
issue
under
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
because
the
validity
of
the
commission,
section
5
violation
directly
depend
on
whether
the
giving
of
this
allowance
violated
section
2(d).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
make
no
contention
that
there's
any
violation
to
section
5,
unless
there
is
a
violation
by
the
seller
of
section
2(d).
now,
the
facts
that
are
in
dispute
are
relatively
simple.
the
respondent
operates
a
chain
of
13
supermarkets
in
the
portland,
oregon
area
in
which
it
sells
groceries,
some
clothing
items,
drugs
and
various
miscellaneous
goods.
it's
a
large
firm.
its
sales
in
1957,
one
of
the
two
years
involved
in
this
case
totaled
more
than
$40
million.
and
it
also
is
the
second
largest
seller
of
goods
in
the
area.
the
commission's
case,
the
discriminatory
allowances
involved
here,
turned
primarily
upon
certain
things
that
was
done
by
the
respondent
in
connection
with
an
annual
promotion
plan
that
runs
a
so-called
“coupon
book
promotion”.
since
1936,
each
for
four
weeks,
the
respondent
has
conducted
this
coupon
book
promotion.
i
have
here
from
the
record
just
to
be
wise
with
the
purposes
of
one
of
the
coupon
books.
this
is
a
little
book
which
the
respondent
sells
to
its
customers
for
$0.10.
it
contains
72
pages.
each
pages
of
coupon
advertising
a
particular
product,
i
just
open
this
at
random
coupon
worth
$0.56,
amends
a
100%
(inaudible)
regularly
up
to
a
$1.25
a
pair,
$0.69
a
pair.
and
72
different
products
are
involved
and
in
each
instance,
the
customer
takes
the
coupon,
turns
the
coupon
in
and
gets
some
bargain.
this
has
been
a
rather
substantial
campaign
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
and
the
two
years
involved
approximately
a
sale
of
$140,000
in
one
year,
a
$120,000
in
the
other
year.
the
respondent
finances
the
coupon
book
based
at
the
actual
production
of
the
book,
by
charging
each
supplier
$350
for
it's
own
advertising
in
the
coupon.
and
the
total
of
cost,
the
total
amount
received,
the
72
coupons
times
$350
approximates
the
cost
to
respondent
in
producing
the
book.
now,
in
addition
to
the
$350,
the
respondent
has
also
received
from
a
number
of
the
suppliers
various
other
concessions,
relating
to
the
fact
that
under
the
plan,
they
sell
the
goods
for
less
than
the
regular
price.
in
some
instances,
for
example,
they've
gotten
three
goods
from
the
supplier.
in
other
instances,
the
supplier
has
given
them
discounts
on
the
price
of
goods.
and
in
other
instances,
the
supplier
has
redeemed
coupons.
it's
conceded,
no
one
questions
that
the
initiative
for
this
program
came
from
the
respondent.
that
these
suppliers
did
not
come
to
fred
meyer
and
suggest
it;
fred
meyer
demanded
it
from
the
suppliers
and
fred
meyer
was
moving
forth
in
obtaining
these
allowances.
after
a
full-hearing,
the
federal
trade
commission
found
that
the
first
$350,
that
is
the
amount
paid
for
the
book,
constituted
a
promotional
allowance
that
was
illegal
under
section
2(d)
because
it's
not
made
available
to
all
competing
customers.
and
that
the
remaining
amount
of
the
benefit
that
is
the
free
goods,
the
redemption
of
the
coupons
and
the
discounts
constituted
price
discrimination
illegal
under
section
2(a)
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
commission
further
held
that
fred
meyer
had
knowingly
induced
these
discriminatory
allowances
in
violation
of
section
2(f)
of
the
act
that
being
the
provision
prohibiting
the
illegal
inducement
of
price
discrimination
and
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
that
relating
to
the
allowances
involved
in
this
case.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
the
finding
that
there
was
an
illegal
promotional
allowance
involved
by
the
sellers
of
this
case
rested
in
part
on
the
fact
that
two
of
the
wholesalers
to
whom
these
allowances
were
denied
had
customers
who
competed
at
retail
in
selling
with
fred
meyer.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
commission
in
two
respects.
it
agreed
with
the
commission
that
fred
meyer
had
knowingly
induced
illegal
price
discrimination.
it
also
agreed
with
the
commission
that
the
respondent
had
knowingly
induced
discriminatory
allowances
not
made
available
to
other
wholesalers.
there
were
two
other
wholesalers
in
the
area
--
i'm
sorry,
excuse
me
--
there
are
two
other
large
retailers
in
the
area.
it
agreed
that
the
failure
to
make
the
allowance
available
to
the
other
large
retailer
has
violated
the
act.
the
court
held,
however,
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
predicating
a
violation
on
the
fact
that
the
suppliers
had
not
made
the
allowances
available
to
the
wholesalers
whose
customers
competed
with
the
direct
buy
and
retail.
because
in
its
view,
section
2(d)
only
pertains
to
customers
who
compete
at
the
same
functional
level,
that
is
retailer
against
retailer,
wholesaler
against
wholesaler,
but
not
retailer
as
against
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete
with
the
retailer.
and
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
struck
from
the
commission's
order,
a
provision
which
prohibited
the
respondent
from
knowingly
inducing
discriminatory
allowances
that
were
not
made
available
to
wholesaler
whose
customers
competed
with
fred
meyer.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
statute
which
was
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
prohibits
a
seller
from
giving
proportional
allowances
unless
they
have
made
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
all
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
goods.
and
they
think
the
purpose
of
this
prohibition
is
very
clear.
it
is
to
prevent
a
supplier
from
subsidizing
the
promotional
and
advertising
activities
of
a
particular
customer
unless
he
makes
the
same
benefit
available
to
those
who
will
likely
to
be
injured
by
this
type
of
favoritism.
that
is
to
the
other
people
competing
in
the
distribution
of
these
goods
to
the
public.
the
promotional
allowances
of
this
type,
allowing
a
man
--
giving
a
man
$500
because
he
performs
certain
services
in
connection
to
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
good
is
to
put
really
just
an
indirect
form
of
the
broader
prohibition
of
the
robinson-patman
act
against
price
discrimination.
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
frequently
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
to
prevent
a
large
buyer
from
getting
these
discriminatory
advantages
over
his
smaller
competitors
as
a
result
of
his
superior
purchasing
power.
in
this
case,
it's
clear
that
the
respondent
is
a
large
buyer
that
it
took
the
initiative
and
that
actually
now
come
to
the
point
that
the
effect
of
this
arrangement
was
to
give
at
a
very
significant
advantage
over
the
smaller
retailers
in
the
area
who
competed
with
him.
the
injury
that
a
small
retailer
suffers,
when
his
wholesaler
is
denied
of
promotional
allowance
of
this
type
is
basically
the
same
as
if
the
small
retailer
was
purchasing
directly
from
the
supplier
and
the
discrimination
was
made
available
to
one
but
not
to
the
other.

that's
right.
his
injury
is
that
he
doesn't
get
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
the
--
it
requires
him
to
make
it
available
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry,
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler,
but
we
think
that
this
is
basically
what
the
statute
contemplates,
that
what
is
likely
to
happen
in
this
case
as
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
is
very
much
going
to
be
the
interest
of
the
wholesaler
to
see
to
it
that
these
allowances
that
are
--
have
been
given
to
the
large
retailers
will
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
he
could
not
do
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
he
could
not
do
under
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
because
under
--
this
might
consist
of
a
violation
of
either
section
2(f),
the
receipt
of
an
illegal
price
discrimination
or
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
take
it
a
little
--
let's
go
back
a
minute.
under
the
statute,
the
requirement
is
that
the
seller
must
make
the
allowance
available
to
all
of
these
competing
customers.
it's
up
to
the
customer
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
take
the
allowance.
but
if
he
likes
to
take
the
allowance,
then
he
has
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
is
provided.
that
is
to
make
it
available,
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
that
is
for
example
as
an
advertising
allowance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
difficult
argument
or
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
method
of
competition,
mr.
justice,
for
the
wholesaler
to
take
this
allowance
given
to
him
because
it's
necessary
to
ensure
competitive
equality
between
the
distribution
system
on
one
hand
involving
the
wholesalers
and
retailers
as
we
say
and
the
other
cases
which
buying
retail
and
thus
--
and
then
just
put
it
in
the
pocket.
he
has
taken
the
money
for
one
purpose,
he's
taken
it
to
the
purpose
of
ensuring
competitive
equality
and
injured
him
to
another
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
in
this
--
he
would.
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
found
that
there
were
a
large
number
or
in
fact
virtually
all
of
the
customers
in
the
city
of
portland
to
be
wholesalers
were
competing.
fred
meyer
has
advertised
to
the
state
that
it
has
a
supermarket
in
every
part
of
the
town.
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
two
wholesalers,
one
had
i
think
hundred
retail
customers
and
the
other
had
40
retail
customers.
there
is
a
testimony
by
some
of
them
at
least
but
they
did
directly
compete
with
fred
meyer's
stores.
he
would
have
to
--
he
would
have
to
make
it
available.
now,
what
we
give
as
an
example
in
this
particular
case,
what
was
involved
was
a
promotional
allowance.
that
is
a
giving
of
money
for
this
particular
form
of
promotion
if
some
of
the
suppliers
--
if
they
would,
some
of
the
suppliers
which
of
this
type
of
promotion
would
have
to
make
it
available.
on
the
other
hand,
there
may
be
equivalent
forms
of
promotion
that
would
be
available
for
some
of
these
smaller
retailers.
now,
it
doesn't
have
to
--
they
don't
have
to
make
the
allowance
available
for
the
exact
same
thing
that
was
given
to
the
one
say
the
customers.
they
have
to
give
them
comparable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
is
this
difference
--
i
think
there
is
a
basic
difference.
commissioner
elman
would
say,
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
retailer
is
a
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
would
have
to.
but
commissioner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
that
under
commissioner
elman's
theory,
the
wholesaler
would
have
no
discretion
whether
to
accept
it
or
not.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
commissioner
elman's
theory,
he
says
that
what
the
supplier
should
do
is
go
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
wholesaler
--
the
wholesaler
can
decide
where
he
wants
to
make
it
available
to
the
retailers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
that
sense,
yes.
but
it's
very
much
to
the
wholesalers
interest
we
think
that
accept
these
allowances
because
these
allowances
to
be
passed
on
to
the
retailers,
are
obviously
going
to
read
down
to
the
benefit
of
the
retailers.
they're
going
to
increase
the
retailer's
sales.
and
this
in
turn
will
directly
increase
the
wholesaler's
sales.
so
we
think
as
a
matter
of
self-interest,
the
wholesaler
will
be
very
anxious
to
receive
these
promotional
allowances.
now,
there
are
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
the
anomalies
and
rather
inconsistent
results
of
flow
from
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
statute,
both
of
which
the
commission
refers
to.
in
the
first
instance,
let's
assume
the
market
where
there
are
two
large
chains.
both
of
whom
buy
directly
from
a
supplier.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
a
wholesaler
in
the
market
who
supplies
all
of
the
existing
small
retailers.
the
--
under
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation,
if
the
seller
gives
one
of
these
allowances
to
a
chain,
one
of
the
chains,
it
is
required
to
make
it
available
to
the
other
chain.
yet
at
the
same
time,
it
is
not
required
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler.
but
this
means
basically,
that
the
firm
best
able
to
protect
itself
because
of
its
economic
power,
the
second
chain
gets
the
benefit
of
this
action.
whereas
the
people
who
least
able
in
the
long
run,
the
wholesalers
do
not
get
the
benefit
of
this
thing.
that
is
the
people
least
able
to
protect
themselves.
the
people
who
need
the
protection
of
the
statute
most
are
denied
that
right.
now,
the
statute
uses
the
words
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods.
and
we
think
in
the
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
what
this
means
is,
it's
seeking
to
protect
the
entire
distribution
process
by
which
goods
flow
from
the
supplier
through
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
now,
the
wholesaler
we
think,
in
this
light
of
this
purpose
make
fairly
be
viewed
as
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
seller's
goods.
because
he,
together
with
retailers
form
a
conduit,
form
a
distribution
unit
by
which
the
goods
are
distributed.
the
direct
buying
retailer
in
this
kind
of
a
case
basically
combines
the
function
of
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
in
a
single
entity.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
protect
here,
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
being
powerful
buying
organization,
bringing
their
power
to
bear
in
getting
advantage
is
not
available
to
the
small
merchant
which
is
necessary
to
accomplish
this
protection.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
to
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
justice.
i
would
not
have
any
difficulty
with
that
argument.
i
think
the
commission
would
because
the
commission
has
always
said
that
for
the
retailer
to
be
viewed
as
an
indirect
customer
there
has
to
be
something
more
in
a
way
of
a
connection
from
the
supplier
to
the
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
we
have
no
assurance
any
more
than
we
have
assurance
that
if
one
of
these
allowances
has
made
available
to
someone
who
is
directly
competing,
that
he
will
accept
it.
i
mean
anyone
of
course
is
free
project
and
allowed.
but
it
seems
to
us
there
are
a
couple
of
considerations
which
indicate
that
the
wholesalers
will
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
allowance.
one
thing
as
i
suggest,
it's
just
in
their
self-interest
because
this
allowance
rids
down
to
the
benefit
of
a
customer
it
seems
to
us,
it
will
be
to
the
benefit
into
the
advantage
of
the
wholesaler
to
take
little
steps
that
will
facilitate
increasing
the
benefit
of
its
customers.
then
another
suggestion
we
make
in
our
brief
is
that
if
you
have
a
market
with
more
than
one
wholesaler,
one
wholesaler
is
giving
this
advantage
to
his
customers
and
it
seems
to
be
it
won't
be
long
before
the
other
customer
will
be
coerced
to
do
so.
it
just
seems
to
us
that
while
you
--
you
can't
force
the
horse
to
drink
but
at
least
give
him
a
chance
to
get
to
the
water.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
basically
is
that
this
may
not
be
a
perfect
solution
to
the
problem.
but
that
this
at
least
facilitates
it.
in
other
words,
at
least
the
retailer
should
have
the
opportunity
to
get
to
the
benefit
of
having
his
wholesaler
in
the
position
to
pass
these
things
on
to
him.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
one
other
anomalous
result
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
which
is
this.
under
the
price
discrimination
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
is
section
2(a),
it
has
long
been
viewed
as
subtle
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
morton
salt
case,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
section
2(a)
if
a
seller
discriminates
in
price
between
a
direct
buying
retailer
and
a
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete
with
that
direct
buying
retailer.
now,
since
these
discriminatory
promotional
allowances
are
about
one
form
of
the
larger
species
of
price
discrimination
condemned
in
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us
it'd
be
most
anomalous
to
say,
that
if
a
seller
engages
in
the
direct
form
of
price
discrimination,
that
is
he
actually
gives
a
price
discrimination
to
a
direct
buying
retailer
but
refuses
to
make
it
available
to
the
wholesaler
whose
customers
compete,
he's
violated
the
law.
yet,
if
he
does
it
through
the
device
of
a
promotional
allowance,
the
benefits
are
not
available
to
the
direct
buying
retailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
do
not
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
we
would
not
call
an
indirect
purchaser
unless
there
was
some
direct
relationship
between
the
seller
and
the
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2(a)
says
purchasers
or
customers
of
purchasers.
if
the
2(a)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2(a)
--
now
they
rely
--
they
rely
upon
--
our
opponents
rely
on
that
distinction
in
the
language.
they
say,
you
can't
fairly
compare
the
two
because
2(a)
in
terms
speaks
discrimination,
the
effect
of
which
maybe
the
less
in
competition
with
the
seller
or
the
customers
of
the
people
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
discrimination.
we
suggest
that
that
is
no
ground
of
distinction
for
two
reasons.
first,
in
terms
of
the
basic
policy,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
and
secondly,
that
provision
as
we
read
that
merely
indicates
what
the
commission
has
to
show
in
order
to
establish
a
violation.
that
is
it
defines
the
kind
of
showing
of
competitive
injury
the
commission
must
make
in
order
to
establish
the
violation.
and
congress
has
--
in
dealing
with
section
2(d),
the
discriminatory
allowances
provision
has
imposed
a
per
se
rule.
it
is
limited
--
eliminated.
this
is
the
need
of
showing
injury
to
competition
or
it
has
also
eliminated
the
coerced
justification
provision
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
read
the
strange
rule
to
suggest
that
what
congress
has
made
a
strict
provision
in
dealing
with
promotional
allowances
than
in
dealing
with
coerced
direct
price
discriminations
that
a
seller
may
do
--
may
accomplish
as
a
discriminatory
allowance
but
he's
prohibited
from
doing
as
a
price
discrimination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice,
he
has
to
pass
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice
that
he
would
be
obligated
to
pass
it
on
to
his
retail
customers
in
the
same
basis
which
he
got
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
to
think
about
it
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
point
that
mr.
howrey
has
just
made
that
this
issue
was
not
adequately
presented
to
the
commission.
i'd
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
pages
107
to
113
of
the
record,
the
commission's
opinion
on
the
exceptions
to
the
proposed
form
of
order
in
which
the
commission
points
out
that
all
of
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
were
fully
litigated.
the
respondents
were
unnoticed
in
this
case
when
the
commission
counsel
began
putting
in
its
quote
that
the
commission
was
treating
wholesalers
as
the
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
because
they
introduced
a
lot
of
evidence
dealing
with
that.
and
of
course,
in
the
issue
under
the
price
fixing
section
of
the
complaint,
2(a),
2(f)
charge.
of
course
under
a
central
line
of
authority
that
particular
issue
was
opened
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
--
whether
the
wholesalers
had
retail
customers
who
were
competing.
the
only
thing
that
was
not
litigated
during
the
course
of
the
initial
commission
hearing
was
the
legal
issue.
the
legal
issue
whether
under
section
2(d),
the
wholesalers
need
circumstances
that
were
competing
in
the
distribution
of
the
goods
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
that
issue
was
fully
argued
by
the
respondent
in
the
exceptions
to
the
proposed
order
which
for
the
first
time,
specifically
dealt
with
this
issue
and
the
commission
analyzed
the
problem
and
disposed
of
it
in
its
opinion.
so
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
of
the
claim
which
is
now
asserted
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
adequate
to
dispose
off
the
issue.
the
suggestion
that
all
of
the
contentions
to
which
mr.
howrey
eludes
that
there
was
no
record
evidence
upon
which
that
could
be
based,
this
symbolized
the
kind
of
factual
economic
arguments
that
are
always
in
advance
to
justify
a
particular
construction
of
the
statute.
it
was
never
suggested
by
the
respondent
in
the
exceptions
before
the
commission
on
the
form
of
the
order
that
the
record
was
inadequate
to
permit
a
judgment,
a
determination
of
this
issue.
the
argument
was
that
the
commission
was
wrong
as
in
the
matter
of
law.
so
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
this,
we
think
that
this
record
thus
fully
presents
all
the
evidence
necessary
and
if
the
case
is
inappropriate
posture
for
this
court
to
decide.
thank
you.
