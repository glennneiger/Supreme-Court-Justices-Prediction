justice
abe
fortas
are
you
--
are
you
asking
us
to
consider
this
case
in
terms
of
the
limitation
of
section
5?
that
is
to
say
section
5
is
--
the
purpose
of
this
case
has
not
been
violated
unless
there
is
a
violation
with
2(d)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that's
--
and
you
agree
that
section
5
could
not
be
violated
unless
there
is
some
technical
terms
in
violation
of
2(d)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
his
injury,
is
it,
mr.
friedman?
his
injury
is
if
doesn't
get
it
and
that
this
wholesaler
doesn't
get
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
i
read
the
commission's
order,
it
makes
no
provision
for
the
qualitative
affair
of
this
problem
by
making
a
promotional
allowance
available
to
the
retailer
advised
from
the
wholesaler.
but
what
it
does
there
is
to
make
the
supplier
pay
all
of
the
--
place
all
who
left
and
make
the
allowance
available
to
the
wholesaler
which
it
hopelessly
and
may
not
materialize,
that
the
wholesaler
will
pass
the
allowance
on
to
the
retailer
and
thereby
achieve
the
purpose
in
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
not
what
it
says.
justice
abe
fortas
wholesaler.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
contrary,
it
may
be
the
interest
of
the
wholesaler
to
put
the
allowances
right
in
his
own
pocket.
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
riding
a
little
fast
there.
justice
abe
fortas
too
bad
they
didn't
think
of
that
--
think
of
that
whether
that's
in
the
statute,
mr.
friedman.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
find
them.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you've
got
to
do
is
to
say
that
2(f)
it
and
that's
a
long,
hard
job,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
have
any
difficulty
in
looking
at
this
acrobatic
fee
that's
so
often
has
to
be
in
the
form
of
the
statute,
looking
at
it
upside
down
and
saying
that
--
and
saying
that
the
retailer
in
these
circumstances,
the
retailers
buys
from
the
wholesalers
through
indirect
customer
or
the
supplier
and
indirect
customer
is
still
a
customer
that
you
will
be
dealing
with
tomorrow.
and
therefore
it's
the
duty
of
the
supplier
to
that
an
opportunity
to
get
in
these
great
benefaction
goes
to
the
indirect
retailer
or
direct
customers.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
aware
of
that
but
what
bothers
me
is
what
the
commission
did
is
that
the
supplier
lacks
the
--
it
seems
that
they
were
down
to
the
enrichment
of
wholesalers
and
not
trickle
down
to
retailers
whom
the
act
by
hypothesis
has
intended
to
benefit
and
protect.
the
act
is
interested
in
small
retailers
would
buy
through
wholesalers,
that's
a
common
picture.
and
that
these
wholesalers
are
given
some
benefits
to
guide
in
some
of
your
argument
which
i
certainly
respect.
there
is
no
assurance
whatever
that
the
benefits
will
be
passed
on
to
the
competing
retailer.
i
don't
--
i
have
difficulty
saying
that
that
advances
the
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
would
you
measure
the
offer
that
has
to
be
made
to
the
wholesaler
in
terms
of
the
wholesaler's
volume.
let's
assume
that
the
2(d)
the
violation
consisted
of
a
payment
for
services
measured
by
volumes.
on
the
base
of
the
commission's
order,
i
assume
that
the
wholesaler
would
be
entitled
to
that
kind
of
volume
measured
payment
himself,
wouldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
when
he
passes
it
on
to
a
retailer,
he
may
--
as
a
result
favor
one
retailer
who
over
another
who
was
a
direct
buying
customer
from
the
supplier.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
--
the
question
again,
i
don't
want
to
take
more
of
your
time
but
the
question
again
is
whether
you
don't
get
this
whole
thing
out
of
the
sculpture,
once
you
start
measuring
it
in
terms
of
the
wholesaler,
which
i
take
the
commission
order
to
affirm?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
a
retailer
customer
who
buys
to
the
wholesaler
gets
an
advantage
over
a
retailer
who
buys
direct
from
the
supplier
in
the
same
volume.
you
figure
that
out.
excuse
me
for
taking
so
much
of
your
time.
i
think
you'll
find
the
word
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
don't
have
any
question
mr.
howrey
about
the
congressional
intent
here
being
inconsistent
with
what
the
commission
did.
the
congressional
intent
being
that,
if
you
will
offer
a
promotional
allowance
to
one
retailer,
the
promotional
allowance
has
to
be
offered
to
retailers
who
compete
with
him
and
then
you
get
difficulty
because
of
the
enacted
language.
because
the
statute
says,
it
uses
the
word
â€˜customer'.
the
retailer
has
to
be
in
competition
and
it
has
to
be
a
customer
and
the
question
here
then
is
whether
the
statute
can
be
read
within
accepted
legal
and
judicial
techniques
so
as
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
here.
that's
what
comes
down
to
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
doesn't
help
you
at
all,
does
it?
it
didn't
help
you
really
because,
obviously,
what
congress
intended
here
was
that
retailer
as
against
retailer
who
got
their
suppliers
from
the
same
supplier
would
be
on
the
same
basis.
now,
if
these
--
if
they
were
not
a
wholesaler
here,
they
were
not
a
wholesaler
let's
say
but
an
agency
--
an
agency
either
of
the
retailer
which
sometimes
happens
or
the
resource,
the
supplier,
you
wouldn't
have
any
question,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
2(d)
allowance
would
have
to
be
offered.
that's
what
we're
troubled
about
here
is
the
circumstances
of
title.
justice
abe
fortas
why
shouldn't
every
retailer
competing
with
the
direct
retailer
or
purchaser
to
get
that
opportunity
to
get
that
$350,
that's
what
--
isn't
that
the
intent
of
the
act
by
getting
the
barbarous
language.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
say
that
here,
what's
happening
is
that
$350
is
given
for
a
page
and
that
if
any
retailer
wants
to
provide
the
same
service
or
to
be
able
to
get
the
$350
and
that's
the
theory
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
that
the
wholesaler
in
getting
and
then
fragmented
as
you've
stated
and
that's
my
problem
(voice
overlap)
the
commission's
approach
to
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
merely
haven't
quite
got
that
facet,
mr.
howrey.
as
i
understand
the
theory
of
the
act,
it
is
that
--
it's
an
admonition
in
effect,
a
legal
instruction
in
effect
to
suppliers
to
device
promotional
systems
that
are
capable
of
being
administered
in
whatever
way
the
act
says
and
the
general
purpose
however
inevitably
expressed
is
that
you
have
to
device
a
promotional
system
that
is
capable
of
being
offered
on
proportionally
equal
terms
to
all
retailers
who
are
in
competition
one
with
the
other.
and
if
i
--
if
your
particular
promotional
scheme
can't

why
don't

it,
that's
