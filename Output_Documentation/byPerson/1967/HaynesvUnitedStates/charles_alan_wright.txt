mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
in
the
course
of
the
marchetti
argument,
someone
asked
mr.
zeldes
whether
he
regarded
the
firearms
act
as
involving
the
same
considerations
as
to
wagering
taxes
and
i
was
interested
in
that
question
because
it's
necessary
for
me
to
endeavor
to
persuade
you
that
they're
both
unconstitutional.
i
do
think
they
involve
somewhat
different
arguments.
the
statutory
schemes
are
totally
dissimilar
and
as
a
result,
i
think,
the
considerations
for
the
court
here
are
rather
different
from
those
involved
in
marchetti
and
grosso.
indeed,
as
the
party
has
developed
the
issues
in
their
briefs,
it
would
seem
that
really
all
that
is
involved
here
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
because
we
are
not
fundamentally
in
disagreement
on
the
constitutional
issue
except
for
its
ubiquity
use
restriction
argument,
the
government
concedes
that
if
we
have
construed
5841,
5851
correctly
that
result
is
incriminatory.
it
takes
issue
with
our
reading
of
those
two
sections
of
these
very
complicated
and
poorly
drafted
statutes.
i
would
like
to
go
first
to
the
second
of
the
questions
discussed
by
the
united
states
and
assume
for
the
moment
as
every
court,
every
lower
court
that
has
passed
on
the
question
has
held
that
the
requirement
of
registration
in
5841
is
itself
unconstitutional.
i'd
personally
come
back
to
argue
that
rather
than
simply
to
assume
that
at
a
later
point.
if
that
is
so,
can
you,
as
again
the
lower
courts
have
held,
nevertheless
prosecute
a
person
for
possession
of
a
firearm
that
has
not
been
registered?
here
in
petitioner's
view
that
the
answer
is
reasonably
clear
and
the
answer
is
one,
apparently
and
importantly
as
statutory
construction.
the
united
states
reads
5851
as
meaning
that
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
an
unregistered
firearm
only
if
it
is
not
been
registered
at
anytime
by
any
person
so
that
if
some
prior
possessor
has
registered
it,
they
say
that
the
present
possessor
is
under
no
duty
to
register
and
therefore
we're
--
we
aren't
incriminating
him
or
when
we
prosecuted.
this
seems
to
me
an
extremely
difficult
reading
of
the
statute
to
take
in
the
light
especially
of
the
treasury
regulation
no.
179120,
that
requires
registration
unless
it
is
registered
to
him.
it
doesn't
say
that
it's
enough
that
it
has
been
registered
to
somebody
else.
it
says
he
has
to
register
unless
it
is
registered
to
him.
and
here,
i
think,
the
registration
faithfully
carries
out
the
statutory
purpose.
the
provisions
about
5841
seem
to
look
to
the
present
possessor.
they
--
the
first
section
--
sentence
of
5841
says
that
every
possessor
has
to
register,
but
then
the
exception
in
the
second
sentence,
you're
not
required
to
register
with
respect
to
a
firearm
which
such
a
person
acquired
by
transfer,
importation
or
which
such
person
made
if
the
provisions
of
the
chapter
applied
and
if
the
provisions
required
thereto
were
complied
with.
the
focus
here
is
on
the
possessor.
he
is
the
"such
person"
to
whom
the
statute
is
referring
and
it
is
talking
about
his
acquisition
by
transfer
or
his
making.
the
--
it
seems
to
--
in
view
of
the
petitioner
that
the
united
states
has
no
support
in
the
cases
except
the
very
recent
ones
that
have
drawn
these
torts
distinction
for
the
proposition
that
prior
registration
by
somebody
else
dispenses
with
the
requirement
that
the
present
possessor
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
understand,
mr.
justice
fortas
how
buying
a
new
license
would
be
an
admission
that
you
had
driven
the
car
at
the
time
when
your
old
license
had
expired.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
should
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
a
closer
analogy
would
be
if
you
had
a
local
statute
providing
that
everyone
who
has
stolen
a
car
shall
be
required
to
buy
a
licensed
plate
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
but
mine,
i
--
with
great
respect,
it
seems
to
me
to
come
closer
to
the
statutory
pattern
of
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think,
fairly
read,
it
does
with
one
minor
exception
because
it
says
that
if
you
acquire
this
lawful,
if
the
transfer
provisions
of
the
law
were
complied
with
when
it
was
transferred
to
you
or
if
you
made
it
and
you
complied
with
the
making
provisions
of
the
law,
then
you
do
not
have
to
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i'm
glad
if
i
could
pull
you
back
on
my
bicycle
by
endeavoring
to
analyze
the
statutory
scheme
as
i
have
said.
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
you
acquire
this
firearm
that
we
are
talking
about
by
gift.
you
are
then
required
to
register
under
5841
unless
the
transfer
provisions
were
complied
with.
if
they
were
complied
with,
you
don't
have
to
register.
if
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
to
collect
the
tax
that's
involved.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
right.
but
if
these
provisions
have
not
been
complied
with,
when
the
gun
was
given
to
justice
fortas,
then
he
is
guilty
of
two
crimes:
first,
if
he
doesn't
register
it,
he
has
failed
to
register
under
5841
and
possesses
an
unregistered
firearm
contoured
to
the
ban
of
5851;
and
second,
he
is
also
the
possessor
of
a
firearm
that
has
been
transferred
without
the
transfer
provisions
being
complied
with
so
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
quite
apart
from
the
registration
provision.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
fundamental
vice
of
the
portion
of
the
firearms
act
that
we
are
attacking
and
our
attack
here
is
a
very
limited
one.
it
goes
only
to
the
registration
provision.
the
vice
of
it
is
that
it
is
so
unnecessary.
indeed,
it's
only
purpose
seems
to
be
to
provide
a
means
for
a
multiple
sentences
for
a
single
transaction
because
in
any
instance
in
which
a
person
may
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
unregistered
firearm,
he
may
also
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
a
firearm
which
has
been
made
or
transferred
without
complying
with
the
making
or
transfer
provisions
so
that
here,
we
are
asking
people
to
come
forward
and
accuse
themselves
of
crime
to
no
good
purpose.
now,
as
i
said
earlier
that
there
is
a
minor
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
how
did
you
acquire
the
firearms
sir?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
register
it,
perhaps
you
have
not
committed
the
crime
of
--
in
possession
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that's
the
issue,
surely,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
you've
committed
a
crime
of
possession
of
a
firearm
that
is
at
anytime
been
transferred
in
violation
of
a
long
line
of
the
sections
or
which
has
at
anytime
been
made
in
violation
of
section
5821.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
you
don't
have
to
register
if
these
other
provisions
were
complied
with.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
even
without
unwrapping
the
package,
if
you
got
it
lawfully,
you
don't
have
to
register;
if
you
got
it
unlawfully,
when
you
register,
you
were
admitting
that
you
got
it
unlawfully.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
mean
whether
or
not
you
complied
with
all
the
detailed
provisions
as
to
transfer
or
making.
now,
the
government
does
put
quite
properly
some
situations
in
which
the
duty
to
register
may
apply
although
the
acquisition
was
not
unlawful.
these,
as
the
government's
brief
concedes
are
not
the
very
common
situations.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
would
agree
with
all
of
the
situations
the
government
puts
so
illustrating
us
but
they
do
put
the
case
of
the
transfer
between
a
maker
and
a
license
dealer
that
registration
would
be
required
here
even
though
the
transfer
provisions
need
not
be
complied
with.
but
the
same
argument
that
the
government
now
puts
forward
that
--
perhaps
you
find
a
lost
gun
and
this
is
not
a
transfer
and
therefore
you
don't
have
them
lawfully.
this
was
put
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
russell
case,
a
leading
case
in
which
the
registration
provision
was
held
unconstitutional
and
the
ninth
circuit
gave
what
--
in
our
submission
is
the
correct
answer.
but
even
if
these
situations
can
occur
that
in
most
cases,
the
duty
to
register
applies
only
to
the
unlawful
acquisition
of
a
weapon.
therefore,
the
registration
will
be
enough
to
be
a
link
in
the
chain
in
any
instance.
it
has
an
incriminatory
effect
even
if
the
particular
acquisition
may
have
been
a
lawful
one
in
these
very
rare
circumstances.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
except
the
use
restriction
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
sir.
plainly,
i
have
a
tougher
constitutional
case
but
i
still
think
i
have
case.
we
concede,
in
fact,
this
much
of
the
government's
statutory
construction
as
i've
just
said
that
there
are
some
rare
cases
in
which
the
duty
to
register
may
apply
to
a
lawful
act
possession.
we
take
sharp
issue
with
the
government
on
it
construction
of
5841.
but
even
if
i
were
wrong
there,
even
if
registration
by
a
prior
owner
is
all
that
is
required,
then
we
submit
that
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
prove
that
there
was
some
prior
owner
who
might
have
registered
without
himself
of
being
incriminated.
we
think
this
is
similar
to
the
decision
twice
now
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
involving
the
communist
party
that
it
is
before
the
prosecution
can
convict
this
person
can
convict
this
person.
it
has
to
show
that
there
was
somebody
else
who
could
have
registered.
else,
we're
back
to
the
lovelace
case
where
the
government
inadvertently
in
its
indictment
alleged
that
he
had
--
had
he,
the
defendant
had
failed
to
register
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
that
out.
he
said,
here,
you're
attacking
the
defendant
for
his
personal
failure
and
that
you
can't
do
because
he
can't
be
required
to
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
hesitant
about
answering
that
question
without
knowing
more
than
i
do,
mr.
justice
fortas
about
what
the
substantive
law
is
with
regard
to
receive
stolen
goods
by
an
innocent
person
whether
he
unknowingly
receives
stolen
goods
but
definitely
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that.
my
attack
of
the
statute
here
is
that
it
imposes
an
absolute
criminal
liability.
my
difficulty
with
your
pawnshop
proprietor
is
that
if
the
substantive
law
is
that
when
he
comes
into
possession
of
stolen
goods
and
reports
them
to
the
police,
there
is
no
criminal
responsibility
for
receipt
of
stolen
goods.
then
i
would
see
no
self-incrimination
problem.
if
the
law
is
on
the
other
hand
that
a
pawnshop
proprietor
may
be
convicted
for
stealing
or
stolen
goods
even
though
(a)
he
did
not
know
about
them;
and
(b)
he
reported
them
and
--
well,
i
think
i'd
leave
out
in
the
(b).
if
he
can
be
convicted
of
innocent
receipt
of
stolen
goods,
then
i
would
think
to
be
a
serious
self-incrimination
problem.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
know
if
the
government
conceded
the
--
this
particular
question.
i
do
not
think
in
fact
that
they've
discussed
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
what
they
have
conceded
is
that,
if
i'm
right,
that
registration
under
5841
isn't
applicably
incriminating.
and
if
i'm
right
that
the
duty
under
--
to
register
applies
to
every
possessor
and
cannot
be
satisfied
by
registration
once
that
then
the
effect
of
registration
is
incriminatory.
now,
mr.
weinstein
i'm
sure
would
develop
the
government's
position
more
adequately
than
i
can.
but
that
is
one
of
their
concession
as
i've
understood
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
person
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
open
to
him
to
say
that
because
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
of
the
law
offers
him
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
the
law
offers
him
a
perfectly
easy
alternative
and
that
is
not
to
be
a
smuggler
and
i'm
not
here
making
the
voluntary
argument
that
we
heard
yesterday
but
it
says
to
him
when
you
come
in,
declare
your
goods.
and
if
you
do
that,
then
you
are
not
smuggling
and
there
is
nothing
incriminating
in
the
act
of
declaring
goods
when
you
bring
them
in.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
nothing,
not
a
thing,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
think
your
question
points
up
the
very
narrow
issue
that
is
involved
here.
we
do
not
challenge
at
all
the
transfer
requirements.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
by
the
transfer
requirements
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
analogy
would
be
if
you
had
a
statute
that
any
person
who
has
already
smuggled
goods
into
the
country
must
report
the
fact
and
the
prosecution
were
not
for
smuggling
but
for
not
reporting.
they
are,
i
would
see,
of
course,
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
i
think
that
by
the
making
and
transfer
provisions,
the
government
effectively
regulates
firearms.
it
is
able
to
keep
a
detailed
record
of
them
that
the
registration
provisions
serves
no
additional
purpose
except
to
say,
well,
now
if
you
violated
these
things,
please
come
forward
and
tell
us.
and
this
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
all
about
but
we
don't
ask
the
citizen
to
do
that.
by
all
sayings
he
could
have
been
convicted
for
having
made
a
firearm.
and
in
fact
the
information
against
them
had
three
counts
and
the
government
for
reasons
of
its
own
chose
to
proceed
on
the
registration
count
rather
than
on
other
counts.
counts
that
i
think
could
not
be
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds.
there
are
several
cases
cited
on
our
brief
from
which
the
government
has
been
scared
of
5851
so
it's
dismissed
the
5851
indictment
for
non-registration
and
got
a
new
indictment
for
possession
of
a
weapon
that's
been
transferred
in
violation
of
law.
the
government
can
do
that
but
the
government
can't
constitutionally
do,
we
submit
as
send
you
to
jail
for
non-registration.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
my
position.
that's
why
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
for
the
united
states
with
regard
to
the
national
firearm
act,
things
to
my
mind
learned
hand's
admonition
not
to
make
a
fortress
out
of
the
dictionary,
i
think
that
admonition
is
specially
apt
in
a
statute
as
poorly
drafted
as
this
one
is.
it
is
a
hodgepodge
of
different
provisions
adopted
by
congress
at
different
times.
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
stand
dramatical
analysis.
the
fact
that
the
past
tense
as
used
in
a
particular
provision
of
section
5851
seems
to
me
less
revealing
than
the
existing
of
--
that
the
existence
of
the
treasury
regulation,
saying
in
fact
that
every
person
of
the
united
states
possessing
a
firearm
not
registered
to
him
shall
register
the
firearm.
i
would
like
to
put
a
concrete
example,
if
i
may
to
indicate
how
we
think
the
statute
has
to
be
construed.
suppose,
mr.
weinstein
has
a
firearm
that
he
has
acquired
lawfully,
transfer
provisions
had
been
followed
when
he
acquired
it.
mr.
weinstein
then
gives,
sells,
loans,
or
otherwise
transfers
the
need
of
firearm.
under
what
duties
do
i
stand?
i
suggest
that
first,
under
the
first
sentence
of
section
5841,
i
am
a
person
possessing
a
firearm.
therefore,
that
person
imposes
a
duty
to
register.
under
the
second
sentence
of
5841,
no
person
shall
be
required
to
register
with
respect
to
the
firearm
when
such
a
person
acquired
it
by
transfer
if
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
were
complied
with.
but
that
doesn't
help
me
out
because
when
i
acquired
it
by
transfer,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
were
not
complied
with.
therefore,
i
am
still
a
person
under
a
duty
to
register
and
when
i
register,
as
i
now
must
under
5841,
i
say,
i
acquired
a
firearm
unlawfully
from
mr.
weinstein
and
i
go
to
jail
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
fill
out
the
form,
sir,
unless
i
felt
to
comply
with
the
transfer
provisions
when
--
unless
there
has
been
a
failure
of
complying
the
transfer
provisions.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
the
gun.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
to
state
the
name
and
address
of
the
manufacturer.
i
do
not
have
to
state
the
name
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
no
because
these
are
all
guns
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
that
somebody's
made
at
home.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
don't
you
think,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
when
the
united
states
undertakes
to
prosecute
me
for
a
possession
of
a
gun
that
has
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
making
a
transfer
provisions
that
it
is
going
to
be
powerful
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
government.
but
mr.
wright
came
forward
to
the
treasury
and
filled
out
this
form
and
only
those
people
would
--
with
--
except
for
on
what
the
government
calls
?uncommon?
in
its
brief.
except
for
those
uncommon
cases,
only
those
people
who
have
acquired
guns
unlawfully
are
required
to
do
this.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
at
minimum
a
permissible
inference
and
on
the
reading
the
ninth
circuit
gives
to
5851,
the
government
has
now
made
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right,
i
can
see
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
government
has
gone
to
think
that
this
isn't
a
transaction
that
bears
very
close
investigation
and
even
if
it
happens
that
minus
one
of
those
rare
cases
in
which
the
acquisition
was
lawful
and
i'm
there
for
registering
only
because
i'm
a
law
abiding
citizen.
that
does
not
mean
that
i
will
not
be
prosecuted
for
unlawful
acquisition
and
that
this
may
not
be
used
very
effectively
against
me.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
understand
how
that
can
be
used
an
evidence
against
me.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
it
might.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
grant
that
it
would.
but
in
the
great
bulk
of
instances,
the
filing
of
the
return
is
in
itself
incriminating
and
in
those
other
few
instances,
it
has
a
devastating
potential
as
against
even
in
the
instance
of
a
defendant.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
just
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
saying
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
a
constitutional
statute
could
be
drafted
to
require
a
registration
of
lawfully
acquired
guns
and
that
there
are
already
enough
statutes
on
the
books
that
penalize
the
unlawful
acquisition
of
guns.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
so
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it's
not
on
the
registration
form,
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
when
you're
making
a
transfer.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
fingerprints
and
photograph
too.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
thought
about
it
of
course
and
then
anticipated
that
the
--
that
would
be
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
court
and
i
finally
concluded
that
justice,
i
see
a
significant
differences
between
the
wagering
scheme
and
the
firearms
act
so
the
narcotic
statutes
are
such
a
different
statutory
scheme
and
i
think
they
would
have
to
stand
on
our
own
bottom.
i
do
point
out
that
the
narcotic
statutes
supplied
to
a
business
that
is
in
many
respects
entirely
legal.
the
statutes
do
not
endeavor
to
reach
only
the
illegal
transactions.
they
would
--
they
require
people
to
register
and
keep
records
when
doctors
lawfully
possessing
narcotics.in
that
respect,
it
is
very
different
from
this
statute
that
hardly
ever
reaches
anybody,
except
the
lawbreaker.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i've
prefer
really
not
to
answer
that
question.
i
don't
feel
well
enough
briefed
in
that
statutory
scheme.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
only
if
the
congress
in
adopting
the
narcotics
laws
indulge
in
this
unnecessary
--
a
form
of
legislation
as
i
did
in
my
submissions
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
so
and
if
so
then
i
would
not
flinch
from
making
of
it
in
the
argument
against
them.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
in
the
course
of
the
marchetti
argument,
someone
asked
mr.
zeldes
whether
he
regarded
the
firearms
act
as
involving
the
same
considerations
as
to
wagering
taxes
and
i
was
interested
in
that
question
because
it's
necessary
for
me
to
endeavor
to
persuade
you
that
they're
both
unconstitutional.
i
do
think
they
involve
somewhat
different
arguments.
the
statutory
schemes
are
totally
dissimilar
and
as
a
result,
i
think,
the
considerations
for
the
court
here
are
rather
different
from
those
involved
in
marchetti
and
grosso.
indeed,
as
the
party
has
developed
the
issues
in
their
briefs,
it
would
seem
that
really
all
that
is
involved
here
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
because
we
are
not
fundamentally
in
disagreement
on
the
constitutional
issue
except
for
its
ubiquity
use
restriction
argument,
the
government
concedes
that
if
we
have
construed
5841,
5851
correctly
that
result
is
incriminatory.
it
takes
issue
with
our
reading
of
those
two
sections
of
these
very
complicated
and
poorly
drafted
statutes.
i
would
like
to
go
first
to
the
second
of
the
questions
discussed
by
the
united
states
and
assume
for
the
moment
as
every
court,
every
lower
court
that
has
passed
on
the
question
has
held
that
the
requirement
of
registration
in
5841
is
itself
unconstitutional.
i'd
personally
come
back
to
argue
that
rather
than
simply
to
assume
that
at
a
later
point.
if
that
is
so,
can
you,
as
again
the
lower
courts
have
held,
nevertheless
prosecute
a
person
for
possession
of
a
firearm
that
has
not
been
registered?
here
in
petitioner's
view
that
the
answer
is
reasonably
clear
and
the
answer
is
one,
apparently
and
importantly
as
statutory
construction.
the
united
states
reads
5851
as
meaning
that
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
an
unregistered
firearm
only
if
it
is
not
been
registered
at
anytime
by
any
person
so
that
if
some
prior
possessor
has
registered
it,
they
say
that
the
present
possessor
is
under
no
duty
to
register
and
therefore
we're
--
we
aren't
incriminating
him
or
when
we
prosecuted.
this
seems
to
me
an
extremely
difficult
reading
of
the
statute
to
take
in
the
light
especially
of
the
treasury
regulation
no.
179120,
that
requires
registration
unless
it
is
registered
to
him.
it
doesn't
say
that
it's
enough
that
it
has
been
registered
to
somebody
else.
it
says
he
has
to
register
unless
it
is
registered
to
him.
and
here,
i
think,
the
registration
faithfully
carries
out
the
statutory
purpose.
the
provisions
about
5841
seem
to
look
to
the
present
possessor.
they
--
the
first
section
--
sentence
of
5841
says
that
every
possessor
has
to
register,
but
then
the
exception
in
the
second
sentence,
you're
not
required
to
register
with
respect
to
a
firearm
which
such
a
person
acquired
by
transfer,
importation
or
which
such
person
made
if
the
provisions
of
the
chapter
applied
and
if
the
provisions
required
thereto
were
complied
with.
the
focus
here
is
on
the
possessor.
he
is
the
"such
person"
to
whom
the
statute
is
referring
and
it
is
talking
about
his
acquisition
by
transfer
or
his
making.
the
--
it
seems
to
--
in
view
of
the
petitioner
that
the
united
states
has
no
support
in
the
cases
except
the
very
recent
ones
that
have
drawn
these
torts
distinction
for
the
proposition
that
prior
registration
by
somebody
else
dispenses
with
the
requirement
that
the
present
possessor
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
understand,
mr.
justice
fortas
how
buying
a
new
license
would
be
an
admission
that
you
had
driven
the
car
at
the
time
when
your
old
license
had
expired.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
should
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
a
closer
analogy
would
be
if
you
had
a
local
statute
providing
that
everyone
who
has
stolen
a
car
shall
be
required
to
buy
a
licensed
plate
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
but
mine,
i
--
with
great
respect,
it
seems
to
me
to
come
closer
to
the
statutory
pattern
of
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think,
fairly
read,
it
does
with
one
minor
exception
because
it
says
that
if
you
acquire
this
lawful,
if
the
transfer
provisions
of
the
law
were
complied
with
when
it
was
transferred
to
you
or
if
you
made
it
and
you
complied
with
the
making
provisions
of
the
law,
then
you
do
not
have
to
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i'm
glad
if
i
could
pull
you
back
on
my
bicycle
by
endeavoring
to
analyze
the
statutory
scheme
as
i
have
said.
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
you
acquire
this
firearm
that
we
are
talking
about
by
gift.
you
are
then
required
to
register
under
5841
unless
the
transfer
provisions
were
complied
with.
if
they
were
complied
with,
you
don't
have
to
register.
if
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
to
collect
the
tax
that's
involved.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
right.
but
if
these
provisions
have
not
been
complied
with,
when
the
gun
was
given
to
justice
fortas,
then
he
is
guilty
of
two
crimes:
first,
if
he
doesn't
register
it,
he
has
failed
to
register
under
5841
and
possesses
an
unregistered
firearm
contoured
to
the
ban
of
5851;
and
second,
he
is
also
the
possessor
of
a
firearm
that
has
been
transferred
without
the
transfer
provisions
being
complied
with
so
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
quite
apart
from
the
registration
provision.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
fundamental
vice
of
the
portion
of
the
firearms
act
that
we
are
attacking
and
our
attack
here
is
a
very
limited
one.
it
goes
only
to
the
registration
provision.
the
vice
of
it
is
that
it
is
so
unnecessary.
indeed,
it's
only
purpose
seems
to
be
to
provide
a
means
for
a
multiple
sentences
for
a
single
transaction
because
in
any
instance
in
which
a
person
may
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
unregistered
firearm,
he
may
also
be
prosecuted
for
possession
of
a
firearm
which
has
been
made
or
transferred
without
complying
with
the
making
or
transfer
provisions
so
that
here,
we
are
asking
people
to
come
forward
and
accuse
themselves
of
crime
to
no
good
purpose.
now,
as
i
said
earlier
that
there
is
a
minor
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
how
did
you
acquire
the
firearms
sir?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
register
it,
perhaps
you
have
not
committed
the
crime
of
--
in
possession
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that's
the
issue,
surely,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
you've
committed
a
crime
of
possession
of
a
firearm
that
is
at
anytime
been
transferred
in
violation
of
a
long
line
of
the
sections
or
which
has
at
anytime
been
made
in
violation
of
section
5821.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
you
don't
have
to
register
if
these
other
provisions
were
complied
with.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
even
without
unwrapping
the
package,
if
you
got
it
lawfully,
you
don't
have
to
register;
if
you
got
it
unlawfully,
when
you
register,
you
were
admitting
that
you
got
it
unlawfully.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
mean
whether
or
not
you
complied
with
all
the
detailed
provisions
as
to
transfer
or
making.
now,
the
government
does
put
quite
properly
some
situations
in
which
the
duty
to
register
may
apply
although
the
acquisition
was
not
unlawful.
these,
as
the
government's
brief
concedes
are
not
the
very
common
situations.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
would
agree
with
all
of
the
situations
the
government
puts
so
illustrating
us
but
they
do
put
the
case
of
the
transfer
between
a
maker
and
a
license
dealer
that
registration
would
be
required
here
even
though
the
transfer
provisions
need
not
be
complied
with.
but
the
same
argument
that
the
government
now
puts
forward
that
--
perhaps
you
find
a
lost
gun
and
this
is
not
a
transfer
and
therefore
you
don't
have
them
lawfully.
this
was
put
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
russell
case,
a
leading
case
in
which
the
registration
provision
was
held
unconstitutional
and
the
ninth
circuit
gave
what
--
in
our
submission
is
the
correct
answer.
but
even
if
these
situations
can
occur
that
in
most
cases,
the
duty
to
register
applies
only
to
the
unlawful
acquisition
of
a
weapon.
therefore,
the
registration
will
be
enough
to
be
a
link
in
the
chain
in
any
instance.
it
has
an
incriminatory
effect
even
if
the
particular
acquisition
may
have
been
a
lawful
one
in
these
very
rare
circumstances.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
except
the
use
restriction
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
sir.
plainly,
i
have
a
tougher
constitutional
case
but
i
still
think
i
have
case.
we
concede,
in
fact,
this
much
of
the
government's
statutory
construction
as
i've
just
said
that
there
are
some
rare
cases
in
which
the
duty
to
register
may
apply
to
a
lawful
act
possession.
we
take
sharp
issue
with
the
government
on
it
construction
of
5841.
but
even
if
i
were
wrong
there,
even
if
registration
by
a
prior
owner
is
all
that
is
required,
then
we
submit
that
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
prove
that
there
was
some
prior
owner
who
might
have
registered
without
himself
of
being
incriminated.
we
think
this
is
similar
to
the
decision
twice
now
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
involving
the
communist
party
that
it
is
before
the
prosecution
can
convict
this
person
can
convict
this
person.
it
has
to
show
that
there
was
somebody
else
who
could
have
registered.
else,
we're
back
to
the
lovelace
case
where
the
government
inadvertently
in
its
indictment
alleged
that
he
had
--
had
he,
the
defendant
had
failed
to
register
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
that
out.
he
said,
here,
you're
attacking
the
defendant
for
his
personal
failure
and
that
you
can't
do
because
he
can't
be
required
to
register.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
hesitant
about
answering
that
question
without
knowing
more
than
i
do,
mr.
justice
fortas
about
what
the
substantive
law
is
with
regard
to
receive
stolen
goods
by
an
innocent
person
whether
he
unknowingly
receives
stolen
goods
but
definitely
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that.
my
attack
of
the
statute
here
is
that
it
imposes
an
absolute
criminal
liability.
my
difficulty
with
your
pawnshop
proprietor
is
that
if
the
substantive
law
is
that
when
he
comes
into
possession
of
stolen
goods
and
reports
them
to
the
police,
there
is
no
criminal
responsibility
for
receipt
of
stolen
goods.
then
i
would
see
no
self-incrimination
problem.
if
the
law
is
on
the
other
hand
that
a
pawnshop
proprietor
may
be
convicted
for
stealing
or
stolen
goods
even
though
(a)
he
did
not
know
about
them;
and
(b)
he
reported
them
and
--
well,
i
think
i'd
leave
out
in
the
(b).
if
he
can
be
convicted
of
innocent
receipt
of
stolen
goods,
then
i
would
think
to
be
a
serious
self-incrimination
problem.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
know
if
the
government
conceded
the
--
this
particular
question.
i
do
not
think
in
fact
that
they've
discussed
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
what
they
have
conceded
is
that,
if
i'm
right,
that
registration
under
5841
isn't
applicably
incriminating.
and
if
i'm
right
that
the
duty
under
--
to
register
applies
to
every
possessor
and
cannot
be
satisfied
by
registration
once
that
then
the
effect
of
registration
is
incriminatory.
now,
mr.
weinstein
i'm
sure
would
develop
the
government's
position
more
adequately
than
i
can.
but
that
is
one
of
their
concession
as
i've
understood
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
person
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
open
to
him
to
say
that
because
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
of
the
law
offers
him
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
the
law
offers
him
a
perfectly
easy
alternative
and
that
is
not
to
be
a
smuggler
and
i'm
not
here
making
the
voluntary
argument
that
we
heard
yesterday
but
it
says
to
him
when
you
come
in,
declare
your
goods.
and
if
you
do
that,
then
you
are
not
smuggling
and
there
is
nothing
incriminating
in
the
act
of
declaring
goods
when
you
bring
them
in.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
nothing,
not
a
thing,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
think
your
question
points
up
the
very
narrow
issue
that
is
involved
here.
we
do
not
challenge
at
all
the
transfer
requirements.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
by
the
transfer
requirements
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
analogy
would
be
if
you
had
a
statute
that
any
person
who
has
already
smuggled
goods
into
the
country
must
report
the
fact
and
the
prosecution
were
not
for
smuggling
but
for
not
reporting.
they
are,
i
would
see,
of
course,
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
i
think
that
by
the
making
and
transfer
provisions,
the
government
effectively
regulates
firearms.
it
is
able
to
keep
a
detailed
record
of
them
that
the
registration
provisions
serves
no
additional
purpose
except
to
say,
well,
now
if
you
violated
these
things,
please
come
forward
and
tell
us.
and
this
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
all
about
but
we
don't
ask
the
citizen
to
do
that.
by
all
sayings
he
could
have
been
convicted
for
having
made
a
firearm.
and
in
fact
the
information
against
them
had
three
counts
and
the
government
for
reasons
of
its
own
chose
to
proceed
on
the
registration
count
rather
than
on
other
counts.
counts
that
i
think
could
not
be
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds.
there
are
several
cases
cited
on
our
brief
from
which
the
government
has
been
scared
of
5851
so
it's
dismissed
the
5851
indictment
for
non-registration
and
got
a
new
indictment
for
possession
of
a
weapon
that's
been
transferred
in
violation
of
law.
the
government
can
do
that
but
the
government
can't
constitutionally
do,
we
submit
as
send
you
to
jail
for
non-registration.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
my
position.
that's
why
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
for
the
united
states
with
regard
to
the
national
firearm
act,
things
to
my
mind
learned
hand's
admonition
not
to
make
a
fortress
out
of
the
dictionary,
i
think
that
admonition
is
specially
apt
in
a
statute
as
poorly
drafted
as
this
one
is.
it
is
a
hodgepodge
of
different
provisions
adopted
by
congress
at
different
times.
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
stand
dramatical
analysis.
the
fact
that
the
past
tense
as
used
in
a
particular
provision
of
section
5851
seems
to
me
less
revealing
than
the
existing
of
--
that
the
existence
of
the
treasury
regulation,
saying
in
fact
that
every
person
of
the
united
states
possessing
a
firearm
not
registered
to
him
shall
register
the
firearm.
i
would
like
to
put
a
concrete
example,
if
i
may
to
indicate
how
we
think
the
statute
has
to
be
construed.
suppose,
mr.
weinstein
has
a
firearm
that
he
has
acquired
lawfully,
transfer
provisions
had
been
followed
when
he
acquired
it.
mr.
weinstein
then
gives,
sells,
loans,
or
otherwise
transfers
the
need
of
firearm.
under
what
duties
do
i
stand?
i
suggest
that
first,
under
the
first
sentence
of
section
5841,
i
am
a
person
possessing
a
firearm.
therefore,
that
person
imposes
a
duty
to
register.
under
the
second
sentence
of
5841,
no
person
shall
be
required
to
register
with
respect
to
the
firearm
when
such
a
person
acquired
it
by
transfer
if
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
were
complied
with.
but
that
doesn't
help
me
out
because
when
i
acquired
it
by
transfer,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
were
not
complied
with.
therefore,
i
am
still
a
person
under
a
duty
to
register
and
when
i
register,
as
i
now
must
under
5841,
i
say,
i
acquired
a
firearm
unlawfully
from
mr.
weinstein
and
i
go
to
jail
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
fill
out
the
form,
sir,
unless
i
felt
to
comply
with
the
transfer
provisions
when
--
unless
there
has
been
a
failure
of
complying
the
transfer
provisions.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
the
gun.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
to
state
the
name
and
address
of
the
manufacturer.
i
do
not
have
to
state
the
name
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
no
because
these
are
all
guns
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
that
somebody's
made
at
home.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
don't
you
think,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
when
the
united
states
undertakes
to
prosecute
me
for
a
possession
of
a
gun
that
has
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
making
a
transfer
provisions
that
it
is
going
to
be
powerful
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
government.
but
mr.
wright
came
forward
to
the
treasury
and
filled
out
this
form
and
only
those
people
would
--
with
--
except
for
on
what
the
government
calls
?uncommon?
in
its
brief.
except
for
those
uncommon
cases,
only
those
people
who
have
acquired
guns
unlawfully
are
required
to
do
this.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
at
minimum
a
permissible
inference
and
on
the
reading
the
ninth
circuit
gives
to
5851,
the
government
has
now
made
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right,
i
can
see
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
government
has
gone
to
think
that
this
isn't
a
transaction
that
bears
very
close
investigation
and
even
if
it
happens
that
minus
one
of
those
rare
cases
in
which
the
acquisition
was
lawful
and
i'm
there
for
registering
only
because
i'm
a
law
abiding
citizen.
that
does
not
mean
that
i
will
not
be
prosecuted
for
unlawful
acquisition
and
that
this
may
not
be
used
very
effectively
against
me.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
understand
how
that
can
be
used
an
evidence
against
me.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
it
might.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
grant
that
it
would.
but
in
the
great
bulk
of
instances,
the
filing
of
the
return
is
in
itself
incriminating
and
in
those
other
few
instances,
it
has
a
devastating
potential
as
against
even
in
the
instance
of
a
defendant.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
just
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
saying
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
a
constitutional
statute
could
be
drafted
to
require
a
registration
of
lawfully
acquired
guns
and
that
there
are
already
enough
statutes
on
the
books
that
penalize
the
unlawful
acquisition
of
guns.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
so
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it's
not
on
the
registration
form,
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
when
you're
making
a
transfer.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
fingerprints
and
photograph
too.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
thought
about
it
of
course
and
then
anticipated
that
the
--
that
would
be
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
court
and
i
finally
concluded
that
justice,
i
see
a
significant
differences
between
the
wagering
scheme
and
the
firearms
act
so
the
narcotic
statutes
are
such
a
different
statutory
scheme
and
i
think
they
would
have
to
stand
on
our
own
bottom.
i
do
point
out
that
the
narcotic
statutes
supplied
to
a
business
that
is
in
many
respects
entirely
legal.
the
statutes
do
not
endeavor
to
reach
only
the
illegal
transactions.
they
would
--
they
require
people
to
register
and
keep
records
when
doctors
lawfully
possessing
narcotics.in
that
respect,
it
is
very
different
from
this
statute
that
hardly
ever
reaches
anybody,
except
the
lawbreaker.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i've
prefer
really
not
to
answer
that
question.
i
don't
feel
well
enough
briefed
in
that
statutory
scheme.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
only
if
the
congress
in
adopting
the
narcotics
laws
indulge
in
this
unnecessary
--
a
form
of
legislation
as
i
did
in
my
submissions
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
so
and
if
so
then
i
would
not
flinch
from
making
of
it
in
the
argument
against
them.
