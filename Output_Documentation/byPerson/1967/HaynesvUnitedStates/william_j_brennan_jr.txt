justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
at
least
the
secretary
knows
then
where
the
gun
is
and
who
has
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
the
registration
may
or
may
not
be
incriminatory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
there
are
some
situations
that
you
have
to
register
where
there
has
been
no
failure
to
comply
with
provisions
applicable
to
transferring.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
if
the
--
the
claim
here
is
that
the
suit
could
be
dismissed
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
without
any
showing
that
this
particular
registration
would
be
incriminatory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
but
that
claim
is
still
is
in
the
case,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
count
--
what
--
was
that
count
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
possession
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
not
been
registered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
third
count
was
because
ha
had
registered
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
third
count?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
this
man?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
claim
is
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
should
be
granted
on
the
ground
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
there
are
some
circumstances
that
with
registration
could
not
in
any
way
be
incriminatory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
are
some.
here,
the
government's
claim
is
that
there
are
some
circumstances
with
registration
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
could
not
be
incriminatory
in
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
do
you
read
there,
it
sound
like,
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
you
still
think
the
government
though,
when
it
sees
a
registration
to
come
in,
its
going
to
say
to
itself,
"well,
this
must
has
been
in
an
unlawful
acquisition
rather
than
a
lawful
acquisition",
although
we
know
there
are
some
lawful
acquisition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
measurably
different
than
refusing,
taking
a
privilege
on
showing
the
source
of
your
income
on
income
tax
returns,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
quite
the
--
but
if
this
is
quite
a
tipoff
to
the
government,
the
government
might
say
this
is
very,
very
--
that
this
bears
very
close
to
scrutiny
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
like
your
--
just
like
the
registration
of
a
gun,
where
some
of
what
--
even
though
the
acquisition
might
be
legal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
has
prepared
--
you
see
we
are
at
a
stage
of
the
case
where
you
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
registration
point.
and
your
argument
would
be
very
good
if
--
i
suppose
if
the
government
actually
prosecuted
you
for
possessing
an
unregistered
gun
or
for
acquiring
a
gun
that
had
been
transferred
illegally
and
altered
the
registration
statement.
but
you're
saying
here
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
nobody
should
be
required
to
register
any
gun
even
if
he
acquired
it
lawfully.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you're
saying
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
at
least
the
secretary
knows
then
where
the
gun
is
and
who
has
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are

the

was
the

what

was
that
count
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
possession
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
not
been
registered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
third
count
was
because
ha
had
registered
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
third
count?

william
