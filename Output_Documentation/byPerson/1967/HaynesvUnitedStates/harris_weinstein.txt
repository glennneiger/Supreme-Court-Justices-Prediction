mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
last
formulation
that
professor
wright
used
perhaps
best
summarizes
his
claim
of
what
the
statute
means
and
did
in
this
case.
he
said,
i
think,
that
we
were
sending
mr.
haynes
to
jail
for
non-registration.
i
assume
he
means
by
that
for
mr.
haynes
non-registration.
and
i
think
professor
wright
agrees
that
to
reach
that
conclusion,
both
statutory
sections,
5841
and
5851
have
to
be
construed
his
way.
now,
i
first
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
5851,
which
is
the
provision
under
which
mr.
haynes
was
prosecuted.
that's
a
statute
that
defines
as
a
crime,
possessing
a
firearm
under
certain
situations.
one
of
those
situations,
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
exact
language,
"is
to
possess
any
firearm
which
has
not
been
registered
as
required
by
section
5841."
now,
our
position
is
that
that
in
no
way
deals
with
the
defendant's
failure
to
register.
it
is
in
the
past
tense.
it
said
--
says,
has
not
been
registered?.
it's
quite
in
contrast
to
another
section,
section
5855.
it
does
deal
with
the
possessor's
failure
to
register.
in
section
5855,
it
makes
a
prohibition
on
shipping
firearms
and
interstate
commerce
in
certain
situations
and
the
first
clause
of
that
says,
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
who
is
required
to
register
as
provided
in
section
5841
and
who
shall
not
have
so
registered
to
ship
in
interstate
commerce".
now,
we
believe
that
the
language,
a
quite
different
language
of
section
5855,
help
show
that
congress
had
a
rather
different
idea
in
mind
in
the
past
tense
that
it
used
in
section
5851.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may
that
if
professor
wright's
reading
of
section
5851
were
correct,
then
this
language,
which
congress
put
into
the
statute
in
1958
would
simply
duplicate
the
requirements
of
section
5841
which
require
possessors
to
register
and
the
failure
to
make
that
registration
is
punished
under
the
penalty
section
of
the
statute,
section
5861
by
the
same
penalty
as
it
would
apply
to
a
violation
of
the
possession
placed
in
past
tense
in
section
5851.
and
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
the
meaning
of
this
part
of
section
5851
is
that
as
i
understand
professor
wright's
argument,
he
refers
to
--
he
relies
on
two
words,
such
person.
now
those
words
don't
appear
in
5851
as
near
as
i
can
tell
in
any
context.
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
taken
out
of
5841
and
what
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
5841
as
i
see
the
statute
has
--
provides
no
help
in
interpreting
the
possession
provisions
in
the
past
tense
in
section
5851.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
that
there
are
two
points
to
professor
wright's
argument.
one
that
i
just
dealt
with
is
that
the
charge
against
the
defendant
is
that
he
himself
failed
to
register.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
we
think
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
for
that
reason
alone,
the
conviction
ought
to
be
affirmed.
but
there's
a
second
essential
element
to
the
petitioner's
argument
and
that
is
that
under
section
5841,
the
registration
requirement,
the
only
people
who
have
to
register
are
those
who
already
violated
the
law.
as
cast
in
the
district
court
and
through
the
briefing
in
this
case,
the
attack
on
the
statute
was
a
simple
attack
on
its
face
of
the
statute.
as
we
understand
that
to
mean,
it
is
that
in
the
petitioner's
view,
there
is
no
situation
to
which
the
statute
can
apply
without
resulting
in
the
incrimination
of
the
register.
now,
in
the
argument,
i
think
professor
wright
has
said,
he
agrees
there
are
some
rare,
i
think
rare
was
his
word,
cases
in
which
registration
would
be
required
without
incrimination.
i
would
think
to
start
with
that
alone
is
enough
to
defeat
his
argument
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
but
more
importantly,
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
means,
in
our
view,
it
is
those
rare
cases
that
he
describes
that
the
statute
was
particularly
intended
to
apply
them.
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
suggested
earlier,
the
scheme
of
this
statute
is
to
require
advance
registrations
or
at
least
notifications
to
the
treasury
of
changes
in
possession
of
the
firearms,
these
machine
guns
and
sawed-off
shotguns
that
are
subject
to
the
tax.
there
are
two
situations
generally
in
which
the
provisions
of
the
statute
will
result
in
this
type
of
advance
notification.
one
is
when
there
is
a
taxable
transfer
and
in
these
situations,
the
transferor
has
an
obligation
to
obtain
information
about
the
transferee,
to
fill
on
a
form,
to
send
it
to
the
treasury
to
put
the
tax
stamp
on
it.
in
a
taxable
making,
now
that
is
a
taxable
making
is
when
it
is
made
by
somebody
who
was
not
a
manufacturer,
who
was
not
paying
the
manufacturers
occupational
tax.
the
person
who
is
making
it
is
required
to
file
in
advance
a
declaration
of
his
intent
to
make;
that
is
in
section
5821
(e).
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would
be
if
the
end
result
was
a
gun
that
was
under
26
inches
in
overall
length
whether
you
took
off
part
of
the
stock
or
part
of
the
barrel.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
exactly
26
would
be
legal
or
illegal
but
that's
the
dividing
line.
the
same
way
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
you
would
be
a
maker
and
since
you
wouldn't
be
a
manufacturer
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
the
only
--
there
are
other
exceptions
to
this
if
for
example
you
were
a
state
police
officer
or
sheriff
and
making
it
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
for
official
use.
but
in
that
situation
too,
the
treasury
would
have
advanced
notice
of
the
location
of
the
gun.what
there
are
though
are
number
of
the
exceptions
such
as
the
sheriff,
such
a
transaction
between
two
people
who
are
paying
the
occupational
taxes
which
could
be
on
a
manufacturer
or
a
dealer
or
importer
where
the
requirements
of
section
5814
on
transfers
or
5821
on
making
just
don't
apply.
there's
also
other
exceptions
such
as
transfer
to
the
government
in
which
the
government
--
in
which
the
treasury
would
receive
no
notice
or
advance
notice
at
least
to
the
location
of
the
gun.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
one
of
the
charges
that
was
brought?
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
in
the
circumstances
of
a
gift,
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
the
circumstances
of
a
gift,
you
would
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
a
transfer
but
i
don't
think
that
you
at
that
point
at
the
moment
of
receiving
it.
you
had
no
control
over
the
transfer.
i
don't
think
that
you
could
have
any
element
of
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
gun
or
even
that
it
were
coming
to
you
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
distinction
with
the
transfer.
if
you
had
knew
that
you
were
receiving
the
gun
in
advance
of
its
transfer
to
you,
i
think
you
would
be
charged
with
an
obligation
of
determining
whether
the
gun,
the
firearm
was
lawful
for
you
to
receive.
mr.
harris
weinstein
where
you
received
the
gun
and
transfer
that
you
participated
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
while
we
recognize
that
statute
applies
to
that,
we
--
i
think
there
are
two
crimes
in
question
here
and
i
think
we've
got
to
distinguish
which
we're
talking
about.
if
you
were
charged
with
receiving
a
gun
that
has
been
transferred
unlawfully
or
that
has
not
previously
been
registered,
i
don't
see
that
that
is
distinquishable
from
a
charge
of
receiving
stolen
goods.
if
you're
being
charged
with
your
own
failure
to
register
under
section
5841,
then
i
think
we
would
say
that
that's
not
compelling
incrimination
because
you
knew
the
gun
was
coming
to
you
and
you
had
the
opportunity
before
you
received
it
to
determine
whether
your
possession
would
be
lawful
and
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
it's
a
waiver
argument
because
if
you
make
the
inquiry
in
advance,
there
should
be
lawful
means
of
acquiring
a
gun.
and
if
you
can
make
certain
that
the
statute
is
complied
with
either
by
the
transferor
getting
the
information
and
paying
the
tax
under
5814
or
your
registering
it
to
yourself
then
i
would
believe
that
your
possession
would
be
lawful.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
we're
talking
about
the
non-registration
by
some
prior
possessor,
again,
i
would
analogize
that
to
the
receipt
of
goods
where
that
person
receiving
it
has
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
had
been
stolen,
i
think
this
statute
puts
on
the
person
who's
going
to
get
the
gun
the
obligation
of
inquiry
when
he
knows
he's
going
to
get
it.
and
if
that
inquiry
discloses
that
the
gun
can't
be
possessed
lawfully
because
of
something
somebody
else
did
that
can't
be
cured.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
has
an
option
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
prefer
to
say
this
man
has
the
option
not
taking
goods
that
he
knows
has
been
stolen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
i
understand
it,
this
crime
is
different
from
the
others
that
you
listed
because
it
goes
to
possession.
and,
if
we're
talking
about
5851,
which
is
this
crime,
the
statute
that
makes
certain
types
of
possession
a
crime.
it's
the
moment
of
possession
that
creates
the
criminal
liability
and
it's
a
possession
that's
made
criminal
because
of
the
past
history
of
a
gun.
now,
the
fact
that
you
could
determine
the
past
history
and
avoid
taking
it
is
not
what
we
would
consider
a
waiver.
it's
an
option.
you
make
a
free
choice
to
commit
this
crime
as
you
would
any
other
crime.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
i
do,
and
i
think
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
exactly
our
position
that
it
is
permeated
with
the
illegality
and
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'll
have
to
confess
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
know
what
the
elements
of
crime
would
be
in
that
case
but
it
--
i
would
say
that
that's
in
indistinguishable
where
it
would
be
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
indistinguishable
where
the
element
of
the
--
where
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
right
is
a
--
that
to
declare
the
item
coming
through
customs
--
whether
to
confess
the
crime
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
afraid
that
i
would
be
(inaudible)
as
if
i
try
to
compare
a
gamblers
and
smugglers
when
i'm
not
as
familiar
as
i
perhaps
ought
to
be
with
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
both
courts
of
the
statute.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
would
start
by
saying
that
each
statute
of
course
has
differences
in
drafting
and
i
would
hesitate
to
be
too
sweeping.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
do
think
that
if
this
kind
of
registration
is
nullified,
the
pawnbroker
requirement,
the
automobile
registration
requirement
would
have
serious
questions.
i
think
you
would
have
serious
question,
say
in
a
case
where
a
man
who
didn't
file
an
income
tax
in
one
year
claimed
that
he
never
had
to
file
again
because
that
would
suggest
to
the
government
that
he
had
committed
a
crime
earlier,
you
have
--
not
filing.
i
think
that
this
do
all
potentially
come
together.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
you'd
say
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
in
--
say
in
the
narcotics
area
for
example,
a
person
who
is
supposed
to
register
and
had
made
an
illegal
transaction
beforehand
would
be
able
to
claim
that
by
registering
it,
he
would
be
incriminating
himself
of
the
prior
transaction.
if
i
may
briefly,
there
are
two
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
turn
to.
first,
professor
wright
has
said
that
we
have
an
obligation
of
showing
that
some
prior
possessor
would
have
to
have
been
able
to
register
this
gun
without
suggesting
that
he
is
guilty
of
some
crime.
well,
we
first
disagree
with
that
legal
proposition
as
we
suggest
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
first
disagree
with
that
legal
proposition
because
it
would
be
putting
mr.
haynes
in
the
position
of
resting
on
the
supposed
rights
of
some
people
whom
we
don't
know
and
in
situations
we
know
nothing
about.
to
transport
justice
holmes
words
in
sullivan,
we
would
be
letting
mr.
haynes
go
inside
a
conjurers
circle
that
somebody
else
drew
and
the
timings
that
we
weren't
aware
of
and
for
reasons
that
we're
not
aware.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
we
would
be
letting
him
take
advantage
of
somebody
else's
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
for
re
--
for
an
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
is
essentially
that
it
prohibits
self-compulsory
--
self-incrimination.
now,
i
wouldn't
argue
here
that
there
is
no
situation
where
one
person's
protections
require
that
somebody
else
be
able
to
invoke
the
other
person's
right.
i
just
don't
--
wouldn't
want
to
try
to
envision
every
possible
circumstance.
but
we
certainly
think
that
here,
where
you
don't
know
whose
rights
that
they
are
or
in
what
situation
they
might
have
been
claimed
and
when
they
never
were
claimed
before
any
tribunal
that
there
--
we
don't
have
this
obligation.
but
going
beyond
that,
we
think
we
can
fulfill
the
obligation
even
if
we
had
it
because
it's
quite
clear
that
someone
at
some
point
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
this
gun
to
the
government's
attention
lawfully.
if
he
made
it
and
was
subject
to
the
making
tax,
he
could've
done
it
then.
the
maker
could've
done
it.
otherwise,
the
first
transferee,
as
if
the
maker
was
not
subject
to
the
tax,
the
first
transferee
who
was
subject
to
the
tax,
either
his
transferor
could've
complied
with
5814
or
the
transferee
could've
complied
with
5841.
so
we
think
that
with
each
firearm
that
is
inevitable
that
there
would
be
someone
who
is
in
a
position
to
comply.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
--
the
thrust
of
that
regulation
i
think,
is
that
you
have
to
register
in
one
of
two
situations.
one
is
where
there
--
no
one
has
committed
any
sort
of
a
crime
of
the
transfer
and
that
the
other
situation
is
that
the
person
must
register
who
has
gotten
the
gun
in
a
way
that
the
government
should
have
gotten
notice
but
didn't.
now,
these
two,
i
would
suggest
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
pawnbroker
statute.
the
registration
doesn't
show
incrimination
that
registration
doesn't
--
has
nothing
in
it
to
suggest
why
it's
come
in
and
we
recognize
that
the
statute
applies
to
a
whole
host
of
people.
we
don't
know
who
they
are.it's
intended
principally
to
bear
on
people
who
run
no
risk
of
incrimination.
now,
we
think
that
every
tax
statute
that
relies
on
a
system
of
confession
certainly
closes
some
threat
of
incrimination
such
as
the
person
in
sullivan
who
files
a
tax
return
and
shows
no
source
for
his
income,
i
think
runs
the
risk
of
the
government
investigating
the
sources
of
his
income.
we
don't
think
that
this
regulation
poses
any
more
serious
risk
of
information
on
--
that
sort
of
person
runs
in
complying
with
the
income
tax
laws.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
just
as
the
person
who
registers
a
car
may
have
bought
it
or
may
have
stolen
it,
i
assume
that
if
he
is
claiming
possession
to
it,
he's
got
to
register.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
and
--
no,
i
would
go
further
than
saying
so
on
and
saying
in
this
instance
that's
the
essential
impact
of
the
registration
requirement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
was
a
suggestion
below
and
in
the
brief.
i
think
that
here
it's
been
suggested
that
because
the
man
who
was
charged
with
being
a
maker,
some
different
--
there
should
be
a
different
result.
but
we
think
that
whether
he
is
charged
with
being
a
maker
or
not,
the
risks
--
well
first,
he
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
we
don't
think
it
is.
its
been
--
it
has
been
advanced,
i
think
it's
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
yes
the
--
there
were
three
counts
in
the
indictment.
one
was
based
on
making
on
--
in
the
information.
and
the
possession
--
there
was
a
guilty
plea
to
the
possession
count
and
the
other
two
were
dismissed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
a
firearm
that
had
not
been
registered.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right
before
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
no,
i
think
one
was
?
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may
just
refresh
my
recollection
on
that.
one
was
for
making
the
gun
unlawfully
without
paying
the
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
issued.
yes.
the
first
count
was
for
possessing
a
gun
that
had
been
made
unlawfully
and
the
other
--
that
was
the
first
count.
the
third
count,
which
was
also
dismissed,
charged
haynes
with
himself
making
a
gun
and
that
was
also
dismissed
and
argued,
was
not
on
the
case
at
this
point.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
that
motion
was
directed
only
at
the
second
count.
that
claim
was
the
second
count
was
based
on
a
statute
--
two
of
them
5851
and
5841
before
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
was
conceded
until
argument
today.
the
position
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
we
think,
for
example
the
reported
case
of
united
states
against
forgett
in
the
sixth
circuit,
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
is
a
typical
example
of
that
sort
where
there
was
a
transaction
between
dealers
and
the
dealer
acquiring
the
weapon
failed
to
register
and
then
took
it
in
--
weapons
in
interstate
commerce.
and
if
he
had
registered,
he
would've
committed
no
crime
at
all.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
--
i
think
that
was
a
situation
when
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
russell
case.
and
the
question
would
then
be
whether
5841
which
report
--
itself
requires
registration
affirmatively,
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
answer
to
that,
the
argument
based
that
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
in
russell
is
that
there
are
these
situations
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
apply
to
where
no
one
can
contend
that
there
is
incrimination
from
registration.
and
we
would
disagree
with
the
result
in
russell.
now
--
i'm
sorry
i've
seen
my
time
is
out
but
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
--
we
think
that
russell
is
based
on
an
erroneous
reading
of
a
presumption
contained
in
the
possession
statute
that
was
there
at
the
time
russell
was
decided.
and
the
presump
--
russell
read
that
presumption
as
indicating
that
possession
alone
created
an
evidentiary
presumption
that
the
statute
had
such,
at
some
time,
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
think
that's
an
erroneous
reading
because
we
think
that
there's
a
placement
of
the
word
?such?
in
the
presumption
that
describes
such
firearm.
and
we
think
that
refers
back
to
the
first
sentence
of
the
--
of
5851
as
it
read
it
that
time
and
still
does
in
the
beginning
--
which
talks
about
a
firearm
that
has
at
anytime
been
transferred
or
made
unlawfully.
so
as
we
read
the
presumption,
the
government
has
got
to
prove
possession
and
some
prior
unlawful
making
or
transfer.
this
is
the
view
that
the
sixth
circuit
took
in
for
forgett
and
that
we
think
is
correct
in
the
answer
to
the
underlying
analysis
in
russell.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
we
would
say
that
that
pres
--
if
that
presumption
were
at
issue,
i
think
we
would
say
that
the
presumption
is
like
the
one
in
the
--
i
believe
the
annie
(ph)
case
and
should
be
upheld
because
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
we
--
if
perhaps,
if
i
could
place
it
in
terms
of
this
statute,
we
would
argue
that
there's
a
rational,
that
once
you
have
shown
that
a
man
has
a
weapon
and
you
show
that
it
has
been
previously
made
or
transferred
unlawfully,
that
its
rational
to
conclude
that
he
had
the
necessary
element
of
knowledge
that
--
to
charge
him
with
a
crime
of
possessing
it
of
going
with
these
attributes.
but
i
think
the
--
i
don't
think
that
that
question
is
presented
here,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
under
the
--
this
statute
as
drafted
and
under
which
the
petitioner
mr.
haynes
was
charged.
on
the
--
or
use
restriction
contention
i
will
rest
on
our
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
last
formulation
that
professor
wright
used
perhaps
best
summarizes
his
claim
of
what
the
statute
means
and
did
in
this
case.
he
said,
i
think,
that
we
were
sending
mr.
haynes
to
jail
for
non-registration.
i
assume
he
means
by
that
for
mr.
haynes
non-registration.
and
i
think
professor
wright
agrees
that
to
reach
that
conclusion,
both
statutory
sections,
5841
and
5851
have
to
be
construed
his
way.
now,
i
first
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
5851,
which
is
the
provision
under
which
mr.
haynes
was
prosecuted.
that's
a
statute
that
defines
as
a
crime,
possessing
a
firearm
under
certain
situations.
one
of
those
situations,
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
exact
language,
"is
to
possess
any
firearm
which
has
not
been
registered
as
required
by
section
5841."
now,
our
position
is
that
that
in
no
way
deals
with
the
defendant's
failure
to
register.
it
is
in
the
past
tense.
it
said
--
says,
has
not
been
registered?.
it's
quite
in
contrast
to
another
section,
section
5855.
it
does
deal
with
the
possessor's
failure
to
register.
in
section
5855,
it
makes
a
prohibition
on
shipping
firearms
and
interstate
commerce
in
certain
situations
and
the
first
clause
of
that
says,
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
who
is
required
to
register
as
provided
in
section
5841
and
who
shall
not
have
so
registered
to
ship
in
interstate
commerce".
now,
we
believe
that
the
language,
a
quite
different
language
of
section
5855,
help
show
that
congress
had
a
rather
different
idea
in
mind
in
the
past
tense
that
it
used
in
section
5851.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may
that
if
professor
wright's
reading
of
section
5851
were
correct,
then
this
language,
which
congress
put
into
the
statute
in
1958
would
simply
duplicate
the
requirements
of
section
5841
which
require
possessors
to
register
and
the
failure
to
make
that
registration
is
punished
under
the
penalty
section
of
the
statute,
section
5861
by
the
same
penalty
as
it
would
apply
to
a
violation
of
the
possession
placed
in
past
tense
in
section
5851.
and
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
the
meaning
of
this
part
of
section
5851
is
that
as
i
understand
professor
wright's
argument,
he
refers
to
--
he
relies
on
two
words,
such
person.
now
those
words
don't
appear
in
5851
as
near
as
i
can
tell
in
any
context.
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
taken
out
of
5841
and
what
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
5841
as
i
see
the
statute
has
--
provides
no
help
in
interpreting
the
possession
provisions
in
the
past
tense
in
section
5851.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
that
there
are
two
points
to
professor
wright's
argument.
one
that
i
just
dealt
with
is
that
the
charge
against
the
defendant
is
that
he
himself
failed
to
register.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
we
think
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
for
that
reason
alone,
the
conviction
ought
to
be
affirmed.
but
there's
a
second
essential
element
to
the
petitioner's
argument
and
that
is
that
under
section
5841,
the
registration
requirement,
the
only
people
who
have
to
register
are
those
who
already
violated
the
law.
as
cast
in
the
district
court
and
through
the
briefing
in
this
case,
the
attack
on
the
statute
was
a
simple
attack
on
its
face
of
the
statute.
as
we
understand
that
to
mean,
it
is
that
in
the
petitioner's
view,
there
is
no
situation
to
which
the
statute
can
apply
without
resulting
in
the
incrimination
of
the
register.
now,
in
the
argument,
i
think
professor
wright
has
said,
he
agrees
there
are
some
rare,
i
think
rare
was
his
word,
cases
in
which
registration
would
be
required
without
incrimination.
i
would
think
to
start
with
that
alone
is
enough
to
defeat
his
argument
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
but
more
importantly,
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
means,
in
our
view,
it
is
those
rare
cases
that
he
describes
that
the
statute
was
particularly
intended
to
apply
them.
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
suggested
earlier,
the
scheme
of
this
statute
is
to
require
advance
registrations
or
at
least
notifications
to
the
treasury
of
changes
in
possession
of
the
firearms,
these
machine
guns
and
sawed-off
shotguns
that
are
subject
to
the
tax.
there
are
two
situations
generally
in
which
the
provisions
of
the
statute
will
result
in
this
type
of
advance
notification.
one
is
when
there
is
a
taxable
transfer
and
in
these
situations,
the
transferor
has
an
obligation
to
obtain
information
about
the
transferee,
to
fill
on
a
form,
to
send
it
to
the
treasury
to
put
the
tax
stamp
on
it.
in
a
taxable
making,
now
that
is
a
taxable
making
is
when
it
is
made
by
somebody
who
was
not
a
manufacturer,
who
was
not
paying
the
manufacturers
occupational
tax.
the
person
who
is
making
it
is
required
to
file
in
advance
a
declaration
of
his
intent
to
make;
that
is
in
section
5821
(e).
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would
be
if
the
end
result
was
a
gun
that
was
under
26
inches
in
overall
length
whether
you
took
off
part
of
the
stock
or
part
of
the
barrel.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
exactly
26
would
be
legal
or
illegal
but
that's
the
dividing
line.
the
same
way
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
you
would
be
a
maker
and
since
you
wouldn't
be
a
manufacturer
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
the
only
--
there
are
other
exceptions
to
this
if
for
example
you
were
a
state
police
officer
or
sheriff
and
making
it
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
for
official
use.
but
in
that
situation
too,
the
treasury
would
have
advanced
notice
of
the
location
of
the
gun.what
there
are
though
are
number
of
the
exceptions
such
as
the
sheriff,
such
a
transaction
between
two
people
who
are
paying
the
occupational
taxes
which
could
be
on
a
manufacturer
or
a
dealer
or
importer
where
the
requirements
of
section
5814
on
transfers
or
5821
on
making
just
don't
apply.
there's
also
other
exceptions
such
as
transfer
to
the
government
in
which
the
government
--
in
which
the
treasury
would
receive
no
notice
or
advance
notice
at
least
to
the
location
of
the
gun.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
one
of
the
charges
that
was
brought?
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
in
the
circumstances
of
a
gift,
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
the
circumstances
of
a
gift,
you
would
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
a
transfer
but
i
don't
think
that
you
at
that
point
at
the
moment
of
receiving
it.
you
had
no
control
over
the
transfer.
i
don't
think
that
you
could
have
any
element
of
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
gun
or
even
that
it
were
coming
to
you
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
distinction
with
the
transfer.
if
you
had
knew
that
you
were
receiving
the
gun
in
advance
of
its
transfer
to
you,
i
think
you
would
be
charged
with
an
obligation
of
determining
whether
the
gun,
the
firearm
was
lawful
for
you
to
receive.
mr.
harris
weinstein
where
you
received
the
gun
and
transfer
that
you
participated
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh,
while
we
recognize
that
statute
applies
to
that,
we
--
i
think
there
are
two
crimes
in
question
here
and
i
think
we've
got
to
distinguish
which
we're
talking
about.
if
you
were
charged
with
receiving
a
gun
that
has
been
transferred
unlawfully
or
that
has
not
previously
been
registered,
i
don't
see
that
that
is
distinquishable
from
a
charge
of
receiving
stolen
goods.
if
you're
being
charged
with
your
own
failure
to
register
under
section
5841,
then
i
think
we
would
say
that
that's
not
compelling
incrimination
because
you
knew
the
gun
was
coming
to
you
and
you
had
the
opportunity
before
you
received
it
to
determine
whether
your
possession
would
be
lawful
and
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
it's
a
waiver
argument
because
if
you
make
the
inquiry
in
advance,
there
should
be
lawful
means
of
acquiring
a
gun.
and
if
you
can
make
certain
that
the
statute
is
complied
with
either
by
the
transferor
getting
the
information
and
paying
the
tax
under
5814
or
your
registering
it
to
yourself
then
i
would
believe
that
your
possession
would
be
lawful.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
we're
talking
about
the
non-registration
by
some
prior
possessor,
again,
i
would
analogize
that
to
the
receipt
of
goods
where
that
person
receiving
it
has
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
had
been
stolen,
i
think
this
statute
puts
on
the
person
who's
going
to
get
the
gun
the
obligation
of
inquiry
when
he
knows
he's
going
to
get
it.
and
if
that
inquiry
discloses
that
the
gun
can't
be
possessed
lawfully
because
of
something
somebody
else
did
that
can't
be
cured.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
has
an
option
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
prefer
to
say
this
man
has
the
option
not
taking
goods
that
he
knows
has
been
stolen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
i
understand
it,
this
crime
is
different
from
the
others
that
you
listed
because
it
goes
to
possession.
and,
if
we're
talking
about
5851,
which
is
this
crime,
the
statute
that
makes
certain
types
of
possession
a
crime.
it's
the
moment
of
possession
that
creates
the
criminal
liability
and
it's
a
possession
that's
made
criminal
because
of
the
past
history
of
a
gun.
now,
the
fact
that
you
could
determine
the
past
history
and
avoid
taking
it
is
not
what
we
would
consider
a
waiver.
it's
an
option.
you
make
a
free
choice
to
commit
this
crime
as
you
would
any
other
crime.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
i
do,
and
i
think
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
exactly
our
position
that
it
is
permeated
with
the
illegality
and
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'll
have
to
confess
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
know
what
the
elements
of
crime
would
be
in
that
case
but
it
--
i
would
say
that
that's
in
indistinguishable
where
it
would
be
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
indistinguishable
where
the
element
of
the
--
where
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
right
is
a
--
that
to
declare
the
item
coming
through
customs
--
whether
to
confess
the
crime
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
afraid
that
i
would
be
(inaudible)
as
if
i
try
to
compare
a
gamblers
and
smugglers
when
i'm
not
as
familiar
as
i
perhaps
ought
to
be
with
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
both
courts
of
the
statute.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
would
start
by
saying
that
each
statute
of
course
has
differences
in
drafting
and
i
would
hesitate
to
be
too
sweeping.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
i
do
think
that
if
this
kind
of
registration
is
nullified,
the
pawnbroker
requirement,
the
automobile
registration
requirement
would
have
serious
questions.
i
think
you
would
have
serious
question,
say
in
a
case
where
a
man
who
didn't
file
an
income
tax
in
one
year
claimed
that
he
never
had
to
file
again
because
that
would
suggest
to
the
government
that
he
had
committed
a
crime
earlier,
you
have
--
not
filing.
i
think
that
this
do
all
potentially
come
together.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
you'd
say
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
in
--
say
in
the
narcotics
area
for
example,
a
person
who
is
supposed
to
register
and
had
made
an
illegal
transaction
beforehand
would
be
able
to
claim
that
by
registering
it,
he
would
be
incriminating
himself
of
the
prior
transaction.
if
i
may
briefly,
there
are
two
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
turn
to.
first,
professor
wright
has
said
that
we
have
an
obligation
of
showing
that
some
prior
possessor
would
have
to
have
been
able
to
register
this
gun
without
suggesting
that
he
is
guilty
of
some
crime.
well,
we
first
disagree
with
that
legal
proposition
as
we
suggest
in
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
first
disagree
with
that
legal
proposition
because
it
would
be
putting
mr.
haynes
in
the
position
of
resting
on
the
supposed
rights
of
some
people
whom
we
don't
know
and
in
situations
we
know
nothing
about.
to
transport
justice
holmes
words
in
sullivan,
we
would
be
letting
mr.
haynes
go
inside
a
conjurers
circle
that
somebody
else
drew
and
the
timings
that
we
weren't
aware
of
and
for
reasons
that
we're
not
aware.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
we
would
be
letting
him
take
advantage
of
somebody
else's
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
for
re
--
for
an
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
is
essentially
that
it
prohibits
self-compulsory
--
self-incrimination.
now,
i
wouldn't
argue
here
that
there
is
no
situation
where
one
person's
protections
require
that
somebody
else
be
able
to
invoke
the
other
person's
right.
i
just
don't
--
wouldn't
want
to
try
to
envision
every
possible
circumstance.
but
we
certainly
think
that
here,
where
you
don't
know
whose
rights
that
they
are
or
in
what
situation
they
might
have
been
claimed
and
when
they
never
were
claimed
before
any
tribunal
that
there
--
we
don't
have
this
obligation.
but
going
beyond
that,
we
think
we
can
fulfill
the
obligation
even
if
we
had
it
because
it's
quite
clear
that
someone
at
some
point
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
this
gun
to
the
government's
attention
lawfully.
if
he
made
it
and
was
subject
to
the
making
tax,
he
could've
done
it
then.
the
maker
could've
done
it.
otherwise,
the
first
transferee,
as
if
the
maker
was
not
subject
to
the
tax,
the
first
transferee
who
was
subject
to
the
tax,
either
his
transferor
could've
complied
with
5814
or
the
transferee
could've
complied
with
5841.
so
we
think
that
with
each
firearm
that
is
inevitable
that
there
would
be
someone
who
is
in
a
position
to
comply.
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
would
--
the
thrust
of
that
regulation
i
think,
is
that
you
have
to
register
in
one
of
two
situations.
one
is
where
there
--
no
one
has
committed
any
sort
of
a
crime
of
the
transfer
and
that
the
other
situation
is
that
the
person
must
register
who
has
gotten
the
gun
in
a
way
that
the
government
should
have
gotten
notice
but
didn't.
now,
these
two,
i
would
suggest
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
pawnbroker
statute.
the
registration
doesn't
show
incrimination
that
registration
doesn't
--
has
nothing
in
it
to
suggest
why
it's
come
in
and
we
recognize
that
the
statute
applies
to
a
whole
host
of
people.
we
don't
know
who
they
are.it's
intended
principally
to
bear
on
people
who
run
no
risk
of
incrimination.
now,
we
think
that
every
tax
statute
that
relies
on
a
system
of
confession
certainly
closes
some
threat
of
incrimination
such
as
the
person
in
sullivan
who
files
a
tax
return
and
shows
no
source
for
his
income,
i
think
runs
the
risk
of
the
government
investigating
the
sources
of
his
income.
we
don't
think
that
this
regulation
poses
any
more
serious
risk
of
information
on
--
that
sort
of
person
runs
in
complying
with
the
income
tax
laws.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
just
as
the
person
who
registers
a
car
may
have
bought
it
or
may
have
stolen
it,
i
assume
that
if
he
is
claiming
possession
to
it,
he's
got
to
register.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
and
--
no,
i
would
go
further
than
saying
so
on
and
saying
in
this
instance
that's
the
essential
impact
of
the
registration
requirement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
was
a
suggestion
below
and
in
the
brief.
i
think
that
here
it's
been
suggested
that
because
the
man
who
was
charged
with
being
a
maker,
some
different
--
there
should
be
a
different
result.
but
we
think
that
whether
he
is
charged
with
being
a
maker
or
not,
the
risks
--
well
first,
he
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
we
don't
think
it
is.
its
been
--
it
has
been
advanced,
i
think
it's
in
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
yes
the
--
there
were
three
counts
in
the
indictment.
one
was
based
on
making
on
--
in
the
information.
and
the
possession
--
there
was
a
guilty
plea
to
the
possession
count
and
the
other
two
were
dismissed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
a
firearm
that
had
not
been
registered.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right
before
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
no,
i
think
one
was
?
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may
just
refresh
my
recollection
on
that.
one
was
for
making
the
gun
unlawfully
without
paying
the
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
issued.
yes.
the
first
count
was
for
possessing
a
gun
that
had
been
made
unlawfully
and
the
other
--
that
was
the
first
count.
the
third
count,
which
was
also
dismissed,
charged
haynes
with
himself
making
a
gun
and
that
was
also
dismissed
and
argued,
was
not
on
the
case
at
this
point.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
and
that
motion
was
directed
only
at
the
second
count.
that
claim
was
the
second
count
was
based
on
a
statute
--
two
of
them
5851
and
5841
before
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
was
conceded
until
argument
today.
the
position
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
we
think,
for
example
the
reported
case
of
united
states
against
forgett
in
the
sixth
circuit,
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
is
a
typical
example
of
that
sort
where
there
was
a
transaction
between
dealers
and
the
dealer
acquiring
the
weapon
failed
to
register
and
then
took
it
in
--
weapons
in
interstate
commerce.
and
if
he
had
registered,
he
would've
committed
no
crime
at
all.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
--
i
think
that
was
a
situation
when
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
russell
case.
and
the
question
would
then
be
whether
5841
which
report
--
itself
requires
registration
affirmatively,
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
answer
to
that,
the
argument
based
that
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
in
russell
is
that
there
are
these
situations
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
apply
to
where
no
one
can
contend
that
there
is
incrimination
from
registration.
and
we
would
disagree
with
the
result
in
russell.
now
--
i'm
sorry
i've
seen
my
time
is
out
but
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
--
we
think
that
russell
is
based
on
an
erroneous
reading
of
a
presumption
contained
in
the
possession
statute
that
was
there
at
the
time
russell
was
decided.
and
the
presump
--
russell
read
that
presumption
as
indicating
that
possession
alone
created
an
evidentiary
presumption
that
the
statute
had
such,
at
some
time,
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harris
weinstein
we
think
that's
an
erroneous
reading
because
we
think
that
there's
a
placement
of
the
word
?such?
in
the
presumption
that
describes
such
firearm.
and
we
think
that
refers
back
to
the
first
sentence
of
the
--
of
5851
as
it
read
it
that
time
and
still
does
in
the
beginning
--
which
talks
about
a
firearm
that
has
at
anytime
been
transferred
or
made
unlawfully.
so
as
we
read
the
presumption,
the
government
has
got
to
prove
possession
and
some
prior
unlawful
making
or
transfer.
this
is
the
view
that
the
sixth
circuit
took
in
for
forgett
and
that
we
think
is
correct
in
the
answer
to
the
underlying
analysis
in
russell.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
we
would
say
that
that
pres
--
if
that
presumption
were
at
issue,
i
think
we
would
say
that
the
presumption
is
like
the
one
in
the
--
i
believe
the
annie
(ph)
case
and
should
be
upheld
because
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
we
--
if
perhaps,
if
i
could
place
it
in
terms
of
this
statute,
we
would
argue
that
there's
a
rational,
that
once
you
have
shown
that
a
man
has
a
weapon
and
you
show
that
it
has
been
previously
made
or
transferred
unlawfully,
that
its
rational
to
conclude
that
he
had
the
necessary
element
of
knowledge
that
--
to
charge
him
with
a
crime
of
possessing
it
of
going
with
these
attributes.
but
i
think
the
--
i
don't
think
that
that
question
is
presented
here,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
under
the
--
this
statute
as
drafted
and
under
which
the
petitioner
mr.
haynes
was
charged.
on
the
--
or
use
restriction
contention
i
will
rest
on
our
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
thank
you.
