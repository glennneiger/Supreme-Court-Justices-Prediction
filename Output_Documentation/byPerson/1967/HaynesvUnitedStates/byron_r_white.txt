why
not?

the

go

mr.
wright,
i
think
you
said
at
the
outset
that
we're
dealing
here
preliminarily
perhaps
with
a
question
of
statutory
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
said
that
the
--
you
understand
the
government
to
concede
that
if
you
are
correct
in
your
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
you
are
also
right
in
your
fifth
amendment
claim
that
you
are
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
putting
aside
the
use
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
also
--
major
correct
in
your
major
correct
in
your
fifth
amendment
claim.
now
do
you
in
the
other
hand
concede
that
if
the
government's
correct
in
it
statutory
construction,
that
you're
claim
under
the
constitution
is
without
merit?
justice
byron
r.
white
similarly
on
the
transfer
of
a
gun,
doesn't
the
law
require
in
this
case
that
if
you
want
to
transfer
a
gun
that
you're
suppose
to
do
it
on
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
made
out
by
the
transferee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
this
the
perfectly
good
alternative
that
the
fellow
has
when
he
receives
the
gun.
that
he
is
the
one
who
is
supposed
to
make
sure
that
the
chain
entitled
on
the
gun
is
protected.
it's
sort
of
a
filing
requirement.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
didn't
--
why
doesn't
the
fellow
then
--
when
he
gets
the
gun,
make
out
his
order
and
make
sure
that
the
transfer
requirements
to
complied
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
did
say
on
the
fact
that
if
he
doesn't
go
through
that
procedure,
the
transferee
doesn't
go
through
that
procedure,
that
is
incriminating
him
to
require
him
to
register
the
gun.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
asked
the
chief
justice
that
the
fellow
could
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
declare.
justice
byron
r.

why,
why
not?
