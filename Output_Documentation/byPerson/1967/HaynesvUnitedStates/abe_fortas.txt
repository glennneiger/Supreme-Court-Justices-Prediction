justice
abe
fortas
professor
wright,
i
have
a
--
and
i
had
a
difficulty
with
your
argument
in
this
respect
perhaps
because
i
don't
understand
it.
let
me
put
a
simple
proposition
to
you.
let's
assume
that
the
law
says
that
it
is
a
crime
to
drive
an
automobile
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
an
expired
license
plate.
let's
assume
that
the
--
after
march
31,
1967
i
drove
my
automobile.
now
is
it
your
position
that
thereafter,
the
--
i
could
not
be
compelled
to
buy
a
license
or
a
new
license
for
my
automobile
because
that
would
incriminate
me
on
account
if
i
had
possession
of
the
automobile
and
drove
it
after
a
license
had
expired
which
is
a
crime.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
under
this
--
under
the
firearms
act,
all
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
register
as
i
am
now
in
possession
of
the
firearm,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
just
as
when
i
buy
a
new
automobile
license,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i'm
in
possession
of
an
automobile
and
i
intend
to
drive
it
on
the
streets
of
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
where
i
have
--
had
a
difficulty
in
understanding
what
i
believe
is
the
--
your
basic
argument,
that
is
to
say
that
if
i
register
a
firearm
and
say
that
i
now
possess
the
firearm,
what
respect
does
that
imply
that
i
have
been
in
possession
of
it
unlawfully
here
before
you.
you
have
to
have
it
in
order
to
possess
it,
in
order
to
apply
for
a
license.
that's
point
one.
and
point
two,
even
if
there
might
be
some
admission
that
for
a
moment
of
time
or
a
month
of
time
or
a
year
of
time
i
had
it
in
my
hot
hands
without
having
registered
it,
does
that
relieve
me
of
the
need
to
license
it?
a
man
has
to
have
it
for
sometime
before
he
can
apply
for
a
license
i
assume.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
like
that
better
and
i
like
mine
better.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
the
point
of
difference,
i
--
you'd
have
to
show
me
a
little
more
clearly
than
i
now
see
it
that
that
is
in
fact
the
pattern
in
the
firearms
act.
firearms
act
does
not
as
i
see
it
say
that
you
must
register
only
those
firearms
which
are
in
your
possession
unlawfully
by
a
theft
or
otherwise.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying,
because
of
the
negative
implication
or
the
negative
effect
of
that
that
the
law
has
to
be
read
as
if
it
meant
that
you
register
only
if
it's
in
your
possession
unlawfully
that
is
to
say
that
previous
owners
have
not
register
yet.
but
i'm
afraid
that
there
are
two,
i
sort
of
fall
off
the
back
in
your
bicycle
which
is
rare
because
the
difficulty
is
that
it
may
be
in
my
possession
because
of
by
reason
of
a
gift,
by
reason
of
purchase,
by
some
lawful
reason
and
i'm
totally
ignorant
as
to
whether
it
has
or
has
not
been
registered.
that
may
not
be
an
uncommon
occurrence.
and
certainly,
i
think
you
also
have
to
look
not
only
at
what
may
possibly
be
the
circumstances,
and
affected
by
the
statute
but
the
statutory
scheme
and
intent,
the
--
in
fact
dramatic
effect
of
the
proposal.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see,
what's
the
crime?
let's
suppose
again
that
i'm
in
possession
of
a
firearm
that
is
required
to
be
registered
and
i
have
no
knowledge
of
whether
it
has
or
has
not
been
transferred.
can
i
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute
and
for
what?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
i
have
registered
it
myself
to
see
or
i
have
filed
registration.
i
file
a
registration,
can
i
be
prosecuted?
but
supposed
i
acquired
it
by
gift
and
let's
suppose
that
i
went
into
a
store
and
bought
it
for
anyway
you
like,
what
crime
have
i
committed
if
i
go
and
then
--
and
if
i
register
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
--
and
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
act
of
registration
is
--
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
whether
the
act
of
registration
would
--
has
an
unnecessary
incriminating
tendency
or
effect.
is
that
what
we're
-
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
if
i
acquire
either
by
gift
or
by
purchase
a
firearm
that
ought
to
be
registered
and
i
register
it,
and
i
have
no
knowledge
or
let's
assume
that
i
have
no
knowledge
whether
it
has
been
transferred
or
purchased
by
a
prior
owner
in
violation
of
the
act.
what's
--
what
crime
have
i
committed?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point
is
that
by
registering
i
incriminate
myself
in
that
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
possession
of
this
which
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
i
have
registered
immediately,
it
comes
into
my
possession.
you
said
that
i'm
guilty
of
it
--
of
a
--
in
violation
of
the
law.
i
have
--
and
i
have
personally
in
guilt
of
violation
of
the
law
even
though
immediately
i
got
my
hands
on
it,
i
rushed
down
and
register
it
without
unwrapping
the
package.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you,
what
if
--
what
do
those
words
mean
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
lawfully
and
unlawfully.
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
another
hypothetical
question?
let's
take
a
case
of
a
pawnshop,
which
is
required
to
report
all
articles
purchased
to
the
police
or
are
all
articles
taken
in
pledge,
i
suppose
and
is
it
a
--
would
it
be
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
for
failure
to
comply
with
that
registration
requirement
that
may
tend
to
incriminate
the
pawnshop
owner
because
sometimes
he
buys
stolen
goods
and
that
that
may
be
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
that
makes
any
difference
on
the
--
as
an
analogy
of
your
argument?
i
thought
you're
going
to
answer
and
make
that
answer
and
i
wonder
if
it
makes
any
--
if
it
makes
any
different
at
all
when
if
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't
matter.
in
other
words,
are
you
suggesting
that
petitioner
here,
mr.
haynes,
can
successfully
defend
here
only
if
he
isn't
--
is
innocent
in
mind
but
he
can't
defend
that
he
took
this
knowing
that
it
was
a
hot
weapon?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
person
in
possession
of
a
firearms
covered
by
the
act
can
be
convicted
as
you
read
the
statute
even
though
it's
an
innocent
receipt?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
that
the
basic
point
on
which
our
construction
as
to
which
you
say
that
government
has
made
this
concession?
you
said
that
the
government
agrees
with
your
statutory
construction
as
correct
then
you
must
prevail,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
they
did.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
i
?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
but
suppose
i
am
in
possession
of
a
gun
and
i
--
which
i
acquired
by
a
purchase
or
by
gift,
i
made
no
inquiries
as
to
whether
that
it's
previously
been
registered.
this
is
a
gun
that
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
firearms
act
and
i'm
on
possession
of
it.
i
register
it.
can
i
thereafter
be
prosecuted
for
the
failure
to
have
that
--
from
circumstance
of
my
acquisition
of
the
gun
or
for
the
failure
of
the
maker
or
previous
owners
perhaps
to
have
registered
it?
now
in
the
present
case
as
i
understand
it,
the
charge
is
that
haynes
was
the
maker
of
the
gun,
he
took
the
shotgun
and
sawed
it
off,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
was
brought
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
those
in
the
circumstance
of
the
case,
i
understand
it
and
alleged
them,
right?
now,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
buy
a
gun
or
somebody
gives
me
a
gun
and
i
make
no
inquiry
and
i
have
no
knowledge
as
to
whether
it
has
previously
been
registered,
can
i
be
prosecuted
under
the
act
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
violation
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
you
say?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
transfer.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
that's
professor
wright's
point.
then,
suppose
i
go
to
a
store
and
i
buy
a
gun
that's
subject
to
the
firearms
act
and
the
clerk
wraps
it
up
and
gives
it
to
me.
and
i
get
home
and
i
take
it
down
the
internal
revenue
or
(inaudible)
wherever
i'm
supposed
to
go
and
i
register
it
right
away.
and
i
made
no
inquiry
and
know
nothing
about
it.
you
say
that
i
can
be
prosecuted?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
but
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
professor
wright's
point.
justice
abe
fortas
professor
wright
says
that
therefore
this
is
an
incriminating
act
on
the
count
of
what
i
do,
the
mere
--
by
the
mere
fact
of
possession
of
the
gun,
if
i
register
it
then
i
am
incriminating
myself?
and
the
question
is,
whether
that
argument
is
valid
because
i
suppose
some
people
acquire
--
i
mean
the
possession
of
guns
that
have
been
properly
registered
by
prior
owners
and
the
maker.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
wonder
if
that
really
is
the
only
argument
that
you've
got
to
support
this
and
i
suppose
that
people
have
gone
to
the
store
and
let's
assume
that
these
weapons
can
be
purchased
via
mail
or
at
the
grocery
store
or
something
like
that
and
i
assume
that
a
person
who
purchases
one
of
these
or
takes
a
gift,
it
could
be
said
and
what
could
be
argued
that
a
person
who
puts
his
wallet,
takes
a
gift
doesn't
have
the
same
reason
to
know
that
it's
taking
some
hot
merchandise,
doesn't
have
the
same
basic
--
the
knowing
that
he
is
taking
a
hot
merchandise.
that
it
make
the
case
comparable
to
a
gambling
situation
because
everybody
knows
that
gambling
is
unlawful
in
most
states.
now,
would
that
make
a
difference
in
the
approach
to
this
question?
do
you
understand
my
point?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
does
that
make
a
difference
here
or
to
put
it
in
the
more
erudite
language,
perhaps
this
--
it's
arguable
in
a
way
that
this
is
not
a
situation
permeated
with
illegality.
justice
abe
fortas
unless
if
separate
and
apart
from
this
business
that
you
are
discussing
with
my
brother
stewart
about
the
option
and
choice
and
all
that
stuff,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
where
do
you
say
that?
is
this
the
form
that
he
has
to
fill
out,
appendix
b
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
now
show
me
where
you
said
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
taking
this
intriguing
transaction
between
you
and
mr.
weinstein,
now,
you've
got
the
gun.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
go
to
the
--
do
you
go
register
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
you
fill
out
appendix
b.
now,
what's
your
--
what
it's
incriminating,
what
is
any
specific
language
in
here
to
which
you
object
other
than
the
fact
that
you
must
say
you're
--
you
possess
the
gun
the
date
you
acquired.
does
it
say
from
whom
you
acquired
it?
i
don't
see
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
all
you
have
to
do,
you
don't
even
have
to
say
you
got
it
from
mr.
weinstein,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
would
be
shown
on
--
that
would
be
shown
on
the
gun
used.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
some
of
them
are
and
some
of
them
are
guns
that
has
been
altered
at
home.
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
and
i
don't
know
what
these
means.
but
in
any
event,
all
you
have
to
do
--
this
doesn't
even
say
i
acquired
it
from
mr.
weinstein.
justice
abe
fortas
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
fill
out
this
form
and
say
that
you
own
it,
and
you
possess
it
and
you
acquired
it
and
tell
him
where
you
usually
keep
it
and
when
you
were
born
and
stuff
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
the
fact,
the
mere
--
the
fact
that
you
went
up
there
and
registered
and
you
say
from
that
and
there'll
be
a
permissible
inference
that
you
had
a
guilty
conscience.
justice
abe
fortas
professor
wright,
i
have
a
--
and
i
had
a
difficulty
with
your
argument
in
this
respect
perhaps
because
i
don't
understand
it.
let
me
put
a
simple
proposition
to
you.
let's
assume
that
the
law
says
that
it
is
a
crime
to
drive
an
automobile
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
an
expired
license
plate.
let's
assume
that
the
--
after
march
31,
1967
i
drove
my
automobile.
now
is
it
your
position
that
thereafter,
the
--
i
could
not
be
compelled
to
buy
a
license
or
a
new
license
for
my
automobile
because
that
would
incriminate
me
on
account
if
i
had
possession
of
the
automobile
and
drove
it
after
a
license
had
expired
which
is
a
crime.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
under
this
--
under
the
firearms
act,
all
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
register
as
i
am
now
in
possession
of
the
firearm,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
just
as
when
i
buy
a
new
automobile
license,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i'm
in
possession
of
an
automobile
and
i
intend
to
drive
it
on
the
streets
of
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
where
i
have
--
had
a
difficulty
in
understanding
what
i
believe
is
the
--
your
basic
argument,
that
is
to
say
that
if
i
register
a
firearm
and
say
that
i
now
possess
the
firearm,
what
respect
does
that
imply
that
i
have
been
in
possession
of
it
unlawfully
here
before
you.
you
have
to
have
it
in
order
to
possess
it,
in
order
to
apply
for
a
license.
that's
point
one.
and
point
two,
even
if
there
might
be
some
admission
that
for
a
moment
of
time
or
a
month
of
time
or
a
year
of
time
i
had
it
in
my
hot
hands
without
having
registered
it,
does
that
relieve
me
of
the
need
to
license
it?
a
man
has
to
have
it
for
sometime
before
he
can
apply
for
a
license
i
assume.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
like
that
better
and
i
like
mine
better.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
the
point
of
difference,
i
--
you'd
have
to
show
me
a
little
more
clearly
than
i
now
see
it
that
that
is
in
fact
the
pattern
in
the
firearms
act.
firearms
act
does
not
as
i
see
it
say
that
you
must
register
only
those
firearms
which
are
in
your
possession
unlawfully
by
a
theft
or
otherwise.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying,
because
of
the
negative
implication
or
the
negative
effect
of
that
that
the
law
has
to
be
read
as
if
it
meant
that
you
register
only
if
it's
in
your
possession
unlawfully
that
is
to
say
that
previous
owners
have
not
register
yet.
but
i'm
afraid
that
there
are
two,
i
sort
of
fall
off
the
back
in
your
bicycle
which
is
rare
because
the
difficulty
is
that
it
may
be
in
my
possession
because
of
by
reason
of
a
gift,
by
reason
of
purchase,
by
some
lawful
reason
and
i'm
totally
ignorant
as
to
whether
it
has
or
has
not
been
registered.
that
may
not
be
an
uncommon
occurrence.
and
certainly,
i
think
you
also
have
to
look
not
only
at
what
may
possibly
be
the
circumstances,
and
affected
by
the
statute
but
the
statutory
scheme
and
intent,
the
--
in
fact
dramatic
effect
of
the
proposal.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see,
what's
the
crime?
let's
suppose
again
that
i'm
in
possession
of
a
firearm
that
is
required
to
be
registered
and
i
have
no
knowledge
of
whether
it
has
or
has
not
been
transferred.
can
i
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute
and
for
what?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
i
have
registered
it
myself
to
see
or
i
have
filed
registration.
i
file
a
registration,
can
i
be
prosecuted?
but
supposed
i
acquired
it
by
gift
and
let's
suppose
that
i
went
into
a
store
and
bought
it
for
anyway
you
like,
what
crime
have
i
committed
if
i
go
and
then
--
and
if
i
register
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
--
and
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
question
is
whether
the
act
of
registration
is
--
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
whether
the
act
of
registration
would
--
has
an
unnecessary
incriminating
tendency
or
effect.
is
that
what
we're
-
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
if
i
acquire
either
by
gift
or
by
purchase
a
firearm
that
ought
to
be
registered
and
i
register
it,
and
i
have
no
knowledge
or
let's
assume
that
i
have
no
knowledge
whether
it
has
been
transferred
or
purchased
by
a
prior
owner
in
violation
of
the
act.
what's
--
what
crime
have
i
committed?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point
is
that
by
registering
i
incriminate
myself
in
that
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
possession
of
this
which
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
i
have
registered
immediately,
it
comes
into
my
possession.
you
said
that
i'm
guilty
of
it
--
of
a
--
in
violation
of
the
law.
i
have
--
and
i
have
personally
in
guilt
of
violation
of
the
law
even
though
immediately
i
got
my
hands
on
it,
i
rushed
down
and
register
it
without
unwrapping
the
package.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you,
what
if
--
what
do
those
words
mean
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
lawfully
and
unlawfully.
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
another
hypothetical
question?
let's
take
a
case
of
a
pawnshop,
which
is
required
to
report
all
articles
purchased
to
the
police
or
are
all
articles
taken
in
pledge,
i
suppose
and
is
it
a
--
would
it
be
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
for
failure
to
comply
with
that
registration
requirement
that
may
tend
to
incriminate
the
pawnshop
owner
because
sometimes
he
buys
stolen
goods
and
that
that
may
be
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
that
makes
any
difference
on
the
--
as
an
analogy
of
your
argument?
i
thought
you're
going
to
answer
and
make
that
answer
and
i
wonder
if
it
makes
any
--
if
it
makes
any
different
at
all
when
if
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't
matter.
in
other
words,
are
you
suggesting
that
petitioner
here,
mr.
haynes,
can
successfully
defend
here
only
if
he
isn't
--
is
innocent
in
mind
but
he
can't
defend
that
he
took
this
knowing
that
it
was
a
hot
weapon?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
person
in
possession
of
a
firearms
covered
by
the
act
can
be
convicted
as
you
read
the
statute
even
though
it's
an
innocent
receipt?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
that
the
basic
point
on
which
our
construction
as
to
which
you
say
that
government
has
made
this
concession?
you
said
that
the
government
agrees
with
your
statutory
construction
as
correct
then
you
must
prevail,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
they
did.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
i
?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
but
suppose
i
am
in
possession
of
a
gun
and
i
--
which
i
acquired
by
a
purchase
or
by
gift,
i
made
no
inquiries
as
to
whether
that
it's
previously
been
registered.
this
is
a
gun
that
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
firearms
act
and
i'm
on
possession
of
it.
i
register
it.
can
i
thereafter
be
prosecuted
for
the
failure
to
have
that
--
from
circumstance
of
my
acquisition
of
the
gun
or
for
the
failure
of
the
maker
or
previous
owners
perhaps
to
have
registered
it?
now
in
the
present
case
as
i
understand
it,
the
charge
is
that
haynes
was
the
maker
of
the
gun,
he
took
the
shotgun
and
sawed
it
off,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
was
brought
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
those
in
the
circumstance
of
the
case,
i
understand
it
and
alleged
them,
right?
now,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
buy
a
gun
or
somebody
gives
me
a
gun
and
i
make
no
inquiry
and
i
have
no
knowledge
as
to
whether
it
has
previously
been
registered,
can
i
be
prosecuted
under
the
act
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
violation
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
you
say?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
transfer.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
that's
professor
wright's
point.
then,
suppose
i
go
to
a
store
and
i
buy
a
gun
that's
subject
to
the
firearms
act
and
the
clerk
wraps
it
up
and
gives
it
to
me.
and
i
get
home
and
i
take
it
down
the
internal
revenue
or
(inaudible)
wherever
i'm
supposed
to
go
and
i
register
it
right
away.
and
i
made
no
inquiry
and
know
nothing
about
it.
you
say
that
i
can
be
prosecuted?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
but
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
professor
wright's
point.
justice
abe
fortas
professor
wright
says
that
therefore
this
is
an
incriminating
act
on
the
count
of
what
i
do,
the
mere
--
by
the
mere
fact
of
possession
of
the
gun,
if
i
register
it
then
i
am
incriminating
myself?
and
the
question
is,
whether
that
argument
is
valid
because
i
suppose
some
people
acquire
--
i
mean
the
possession
of
guns
that
have
been
properly
registered
by
prior
owners
and
the
maker.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
wonder
if
that
really
is
the
only
argument
that
you've
got
to
support
this
and
i
suppose
that
people
have
gone
to
the
store
and
let's
assume
that
these
weapons
can
be
purchased
via
mail
or
at
the
grocery
store
or
something
like
that
and
i
assume
that
a
person
who
purchases
one
of
these
or
takes
a
gift,
it
could
be
said
and
what
could
be
argued
that
a
person
who
puts
his
wallet,
takes
a
gift
doesn't
have
the
same
reason
to
know
that
it's
taking
some
hot
merchandise,
doesn't
have
the
same
basic
--
the
knowing
that
he
is
taking
a
hot
merchandise.
that
it
make
the
case
comparable
to
a
gambling
situation
because
everybody
knows
that
gambling
is
unlawful
in
most
states.
now,
would
that
make
a
difference
in
the
approach
to
this
question?
do
you
understand
my
point?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
does
that
make
a
difference
here
or
to
put
it
in
the
more
erudite
language,
perhaps
this
--
it's
arguable
in
a
way
that
this
is
not
a
situation
permeated
with
illegality.
justice
abe
fortas
unless
if
separate
and
apart
from
this
business
that
you
are
discussing
with
my
brother
stewart
about
the
option
and
choice
and
all
that
stuff,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
where
do
you
say
that?
is
this
the
form
that
he
has
to
fill
out,
appendix
b
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
now
show
me
where
you
said
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
taking
this
intriguing
transaction
between
you
and
mr.
weinstein,
now,
you've
got
the
gun.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
go
to
the
--
do
you
go
register
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
you
fill
out
appendix
b.
now,
what's
your
--
what
it's
incriminating,
what
is
any
specific
language
in
here
to
which
you
object
other
than
the
fact
that
you
must
say
you're
--
you
possess
the
gun
the
date
you
acquired.
does
it
say
from
whom
you
acquired
it?
i
don't
see
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
all
you
have
to
do,
you
don't
even
have
to
say
you
got
it
from
mr.
weinstein,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
would
be
shown
on
--
that
would
be
shown
on
the
gun
used.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
some
of
them
are
and
some
of
them
are
guns
that
has
been
altered
at
home.
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
and
i
don't
know
what
these
means.
but
in
any
event,
all
you
have
to
do
--
this
doesn't
even
say
i
acquired
it
from
mr.
weinstein.
justice
abe
fortas
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
fill
out
this
form
and
say
that
you
own
it,
and
you
possess
it
and
you
acquired
it
and
tell
him
where
you
usually
keep
it
and
when
you
were
born
and
stuff
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
the
fact,
the
mere
--
the
fact
that
you
went
up
there
and
registered
and
you
say
from
that
and
there'll
be
a
permissible
inference
that
you
had
a
guilty
conscience.
