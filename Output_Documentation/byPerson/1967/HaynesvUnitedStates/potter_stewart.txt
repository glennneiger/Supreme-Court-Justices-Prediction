justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand,
as
you
read
these
statutes
that
the
upshot
of
it
is
that
you
have
to
confess
to
the
violation
of
one
criminal
offense
in
order
to
have
a
defense
to
the
violation
of
another.
in
other
words,
that
your
only
defense
against
possession
of
a
firearm
within
the
definition
is
that
if
you
have
registered
it
but
if
you
register
it,
you're
guilty
of
another
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that?
if
i
got
it
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
that
kind
of
a
maker
be
who
is
not
a
manufacturer?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
--
if
i
bought
an
ordinary
shotgun,
a
bird-shooting
shotgun
and
--
or
a
larger
gauge,
12
gauge
and
then
decided
a
sawed-off
but
i
have
to
--
would
i
be
a
maker?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
were
26
and
1/8
inches,
i
wouldn't
be
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
would
be
a
maker
then?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
to
register
it
then?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i'm
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
that
smack
of
the
old
kahriger
and
lewis
arguments
that
you
don't
have
to
commit
a
crime.
so
voluntary,
you
don't
have
to
commit
murder
and
rape
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
therefore,
that
takes
any
force
at
all
out
of
fifth
amendment,
that
argument.
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
you
do,
then
you
waive
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
the
conclusion
of
the
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
mr.
wright
at
least
to
give
this
that
the
statute
makes
it
as
justice
fortas'
question
illustrate
it,
makes
it
an
offense
to
possess
a
firearm
as
defined
if
anywhere
back
in
the
manufacturer
or
the
chain
of
title
there
has
not
been
a
registration.
and
therefore,
if
you
require
one
in
the
way
that
justice
fortas
described,
it's
your
--
and
you
register
it.
you
are
then
right
then
and
there
giving
evidence
that
you
are
in
possession
of
a
firearm
that
somewhere
back
in
the
chain
of
title
was
not
registered
and
you
are
therefore
guilty
of
an
offense.and
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
register
it,
you
are
guilty
of
an
offense.
now,
isn't
that
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
guilty
of
a
different
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
the
option
of
not
buying
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
man
has
an
option
of
not
committing
a
rape,
i
suppose
assuming
he's
a
(inaudible)
man.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
crime,
burglary,
receiving
stolen
good,
assault
and
battery,
any
of
these
things,
and
the
argument
leads
to
the
fact
that
he
--
since
you
have
an
option
to
do
or
not
to
do
this
criminal
conduct,
if
you
do
it,
you
waive
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that's
an
argument
that
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
accepting.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
there
be
an
extra-ordinary
potential
impact
upon
a
--
what
seems
to
be
in
the
area
of
federal
criminal
law
and
much
larger,
a
quantitative
problem
that
is
the
narcotics
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
all
drafted
in
terms
of
many,
many
of
that
--
much
of
that
legislation
and
the
only
original
legislation
was
drafted
in
terms
of
paying
a
tax,
paying
a
duty,
a
possession
of
something
on
which
the
duty
hadn't
been
paid.
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
have
it
--
this
on,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
without
again
getting
into
the
specific
wording
of
the
statute,
certainly
this
would
have
quite
an
impact
on
that
issue
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
--
i
didn't
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
is
this
a
matter
of
standing
or
what
is
this,
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
matter
of
standing
or
is
it
--
or
is
your
point
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
compulsory
self-incrimination
not
compulsory
incrimination
of
somebody
else.
which
is
it
or
neither?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wright,
just
to
--
(inaudible)
as
required
to
the
applicant
permitted
to
(inaudible)
--
is
that
the
only
application
forms,
do
you
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
they're
5841
or
5851?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not.
this
one
is
an
application,
an
order
for
transfer
of
a
firearm
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
form
for
firearms
and
then
there's
a
declaration
of
intent
to
make
a
firearm,
form
1a
firearm,
requires
fingerprint
from
the
applicant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
registration
form
does
not,
you're
telling
me?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
thought
of
the
--
or
looked
into
at
all
the
impact
of
the
argument
you
are
making
to
us
today
in
the
federal
narcotic
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
a
presumption
that
a
possessor
of
narcotics
is
in
possession
of
narcotics
upon
which
the
tax
had
not
been
paid
and
it's
up
to
him
to
rebut
that
presumption.
if
he
does,
he
can
get
the
same
kind
of
difficulty
that
you
say
this
tangled
up
into
the
cross,
the
quick
sawing
effect
of
(inaudible)
of
different
criminal
statute.
there
are
those
basics
somewhere
in
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
not,
i
don't
have
the
.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there,
it's
pretty
clear
that
this,
at
least
briefly,
would
get
pretty
close
to
some
of
those
narcotic
laws
which
are
on
the
same
general
area
of
the
fifth
amendment
concern,
is
it
not?
justice
potter

it
