petitioner,

mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
professor,
may
i
ask
you
if
in
the
anti-smuggling
under
the
anti-smuggling
laws
that
the
man
is
arrested,
prosecuted
for
having
goods
in
his
possession
that
were
not
declared
when
he
brought
them
into
this
country,
when
he's
prosecuted
for
having
them
under
those
conditions,
is
it
open
to
him
to
say,
well,
i
didn't
declare
those
things
because
i
was
a
smuggler.
and
if
i
had
declared
those
things
when
i
brought
the
man,
i
would
be
admitting
my
guilt?
and
therefore,
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
violated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
in
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
constitutional
respect
is
that
different
from
yours?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstien.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein,
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
there
is
in
your
any
constitutional
difference
between
the
prosecution
under
5851
as
we
have
in
this
case
and
the
prosecution
of
a
defendant
for
having
in
his
possession
a
gun
that
was
imported
into
this
country
without
having
and
declared
it
and
paid
the
taxes
under
the
custom
laws.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
indistinguishable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
he
--
as
a
gambler,
it
says
here,
you
make
me
register
as
a
gambler
and
therefore,
you
violate
my
fifth
amendment
rights.
would
the
smuggler
would
be
able
to
say,
"well,
i
wasn't
an
honest
citizen
bringing
this
in.i
was
a
smuggler
and
if
you
made
me
declare
it
when
i
brought
it
in
and
pay
a
tax
and
admit
that
i
did,
well,
you're
violating
my
fifth
amendment's
rights
too".
that's
all.
that's
--
i
just
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
in
--
as
then
mr.
justice
fortas
would
ask
you
about
the
pawnshops
and
that
there've
been
other
questions
asked
along
the
line,
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
implications
of
deciding
this
would
be.
i'm
not
questioning
your
argument
in
the
slightest
but
i
want
to
know,
i
like
to
know
before
we
decide
this
case
if
we
are
going
to
in
the
--
in
deciding
for
the
petitioner
here
if
we
are
going
to
nullify
the
smuggling
laws
and
maybe
the
pawnbrokers
laws
and
the
firearms
law
and
all
other
laws
which
require
registration
and
the
theory
that
if
a
man
is
dishonest
and
is
violating
the
law,
you
can't
compel
him
to
register
because
it
might
admit
his
guilt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
a
little
louder
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

justice
earl
warren
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren

recess
now.
