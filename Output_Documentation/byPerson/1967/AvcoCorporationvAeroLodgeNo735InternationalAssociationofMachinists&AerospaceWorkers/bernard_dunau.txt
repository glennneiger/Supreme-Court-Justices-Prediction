mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
an
employer
claims
that
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
strike
takes
place
in
violation
of
the
no
strike
commitment.
based
on
that
claim
of
contract
violation,
he
brings
a
suit
in
a
state
court
and
requests
a
strike
injunction
as
relief
for
the
contract
violation.
the
union
removes
that
action
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court
and
our
only
question
is
whether
that
action
is
properly
removed.
now
that
action
is
properly
removed
if
two
requirements
of
removal
are
met.
one,
the
action
must
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court,
and
two,
the
action
must
be
founded
on
a
claim
or
right
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
now
with
respect
to
the
requirement,
the
arising
under
requirement,
a
--
when
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce
that
an
action
for
violation
of
that
agreement
must
rest
on
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
there
is
no
other
law
on
which
that
action
can
be
based.
there
is
no
law,
but
federal
law
which
can
be
invoked
with
respect
to
a
claimed
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
true
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
a
state
court,
if
the
action
stayed
in
the
state
court
would
have
the
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction,
because
the
state
court
on
that
hypothesis
would
have
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
only
because
the
federal
law
said
it
had
that
authority.
whether
or
not
the
state
court
can
issue
a
strike
injunction
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
so
which
ever
way
this
action
is
sliced,
it
can
only
arise
under
our
law
--
under
a
--
it
can
only
arise
under
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
question
is
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
we
do,
only
because
we
cannot
be
entirely
sure
what
--
(inaudible)
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
be
delighted
if
you
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
decided
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
though
authority,
the
issue
will
strike
it
judge,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
no
response
of
pleading
was
ever
filed
in
the
tennessee
action
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
certainly
would
have
claimed
that
federal
law
precludes
a
state
from
issuing
a
strike
injunction
in
a
suit
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
yes
sir.
now
the
other
question
necessary
to
removal
requirement
we
must
satisfy
is
that
the
action
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
original
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court,
we
have
i
think
a
very
plain
setting.
a
federal
court
has
the
power
decide
contract
claims,
violations,
alleged
violations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
a
federal
court,
if
it
defines
that
there
has
been
a
contract
violation
is
empowered
as
the,
whatever
if
that
is
the
appropriate
remedy
to
compel
arbitration,
to
confirm
or
vacate
an
arbitration
award,
to
render
a
money
judgment,
to
render
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
one
thing
it
may
not
do
by
reason
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
to
issue
a
strike
injunction.
and
our
sole
question
therefore
with
respect
to
the
requirement
of
original
jurisdiction
is
whether
the
lack
of
authority
of
a
federal
court
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
is
a
divestiture
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
is
a
limitation
of
equity
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
solely
a
limitation
of
equity
jurisdiction
that
is
not
the
kind
of
lack
original
jurisdiction
of
which
the
removal
statute
speaks.
if
it's
a
limitation
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
then
we
cannot
remove
this
type
of
action.
now
the
norris-laguardia
act
aside,
it
is
crystal
clear
that
a
limitation
upon
the
power
of
a
federal
court
or
the
authority
of
a
federal
court
to
issue
an
injunction
is
--
does
not
go
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court.
it
goes
to
equity
jurisdiction.
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
claim.
if
that
is
correct,
then
what
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
is,
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
itself
make
an
alteration
in
that
analysis.
and
the
sole
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
said
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
itself
relates
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
rather
than
equity
jurisdiction,
it
is
because
the
norris-laguardia
act
talks
in
the
language
of
jurisdiction.
but
the
talk
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
language
jurisdiction
is
just
as
fully
explicable
as
a
reference
to
equity
jurisdiction
and
much
more
clearly
a
reference
to
equity
jurisdiction
than
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
every
place
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
the
word
jurisdiction
is
used,
one
can
insert
equity
jurisdiction
and
make
no
slightest
alteration
in
the
sense
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
norris-laguardia
act.
let's
take
a
look
the
statute.
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
say
that
a
federal
court
is
not
empowered
to
adjudicate
controversies
arising
out
of
or
involving
labor
disputes.
what
it
says
is
that
you
have
such
a
controversy,
therefore
a
federal
court
you
can
not
get
injunctive
relief
unless
you
satisfy
certain
prerequisites.
this
statute,
the
norris-laguardia
act
begins
with
a
public
policy
which
expresses
national
labor
policy.
it
was
enacted
in
1932.
in
1935
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
same
virtually
in
so
many
words,
the
same
national
labor
policy
expressed
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
expressed
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
therefore
deal
with
a
statute
which
is
(inaudible)
on
congress'
recognition
in
its
view
of
what
was
important
to
national
labor
policy.
this
statute
has
substantive
import.
on
its
face,
it
outlaws
the
“yellow
dog
contract”.
on
its
face
it
prescribes
rules
with
respect
to
vicarious
responsibility.
it
has
requirements
which
are
--
which
pertain
to
traditional
equity
practice,
the
requirement
of
substantial
irreparable
injury,
the
requirement
of
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
it
has
procedural
requirements.
before
you
can
get
an
injunction
you
have
to
have
a
bond.
before
you
can
get
an
injunction
findings
of
fact
must
be
made.
now
it
says
that
certain
acts
under
no
circumstances
will
be
enjoined,
this
strike
being
preeminent
illustration,
but
even
in
describing
certain
non-enjoinable
acts
is
carefully
qualified.
you
cannot
restrain
picketing
or
other
publication
of
a
labor
dispute
unless
there's
fraud
or
violence.
you
cannot
prohibit
assembly
unless
it's
unlawful.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
entirety
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
necessarily
speaks
not
of
a
divestiture
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
the
controversy
but
a
circumscription
of
the
manner
in
which
it
will
exercise
that
power.
now
we
didn't
invent
this
distinction
between
equity
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
we
didn't
invent
its
application
to
the
norris-laguardia
act.
throughout
the
passage,
the
deliberations
in
congress
which
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
legislative
refrain
was,
we
are
dealing
with
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
for
example
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
congressman
bank
(ph)
speaking.
he
says
of
the
bill
which
became
the
norris-laguardia
act
“it
does
not
undertake
to
withdraw
from
the
federal
judiciary,
any
of
its
functions
in
equity,
but
it
nearly
imposes
conditions
upon
them
and
restraints
upon
them
with
reference
to
the
issuance
of
injunctions
and
labor
disputes.”
and
in
the
house
bill,
there
was
attached
a
memorandum
by
then
professor
felix
frankfurter
which
described
in
detail
the
constitutional
power
that
congress
would
be
exercising
in
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
in
that
memorandum
then
professor
frankfurter
said
“the
congress
would
be
exercising
its
power
over
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.”
and
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
bakery
drivers
workers
union
v.
wagshal
said
“the
question
is
whether
the
complaint
subjects
the
court
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
upon
its
equity
jurisdiction.”
we
think
therefore
that
clearly
this
action
meets
the
two
requirements
for
removal.
one
that
the
action
arise
under
a
law
of
the
united
states,
there
is
no
other
under
which
it
can
arise
in
this
case
and
two
that
it
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
because
the
only
limitation
in
this
case
pertains
to
the
equity
jurisdiction
and
that
is
not
a
requirement
which
goes
to
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
only
sir
if
one
takes
the
position
that
if
a
complaint
is
silent,
it
does
not
mention
section
301
then
there
exists
somehow
a
state
law
which
may
still
be
invoked.
mr.
bernard
dunau
you
do
not
need
to
mention
301
but
your
silence
on
the
subject
doesn't
remove
301
as
being
the
only
law
under
which
such
an
action
can
arise.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
thought
that
that
was
settled
with
respect
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
it
does.
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
this
court
said
in
an
international
association
of
machinist
v.
central
airlines
when
it
discussed
not
a
301
action,
or
a
301
contract,
but
when
it
discussed
a
section
301
railway
labor
act
contract,
it
was
the
same
question
under
a
301
contract
as
under
a
railway
labor
act
contract
as
the
action
arise
under
federal
law
or
under
the
state
law,
it
is
true
that
in
the
central
airlines
case
the
action
was
initially
begun
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
the
same
question
whether
the
--
or
the
arising
under
question
is
the
same
whether
you're
concerned
with
does
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
if
the
action
is
brought
originally
in
the
federal
court,
or
does
it
have
jurisdiction
on
removal.
and
this
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
no,
in
the
sense
that
if
you
in
truth
could
allege
a
state
action
but
the
result
of
that
action
would
be,
or
the
aim
of
that
action
would
be
defeated
by
bringing
in
federal
law
as
a
defense.
and
if
in
that
sense
that
action
is
controlled,
it
doesn't
arise
under,
but
we
have
no
such
or
we
certainly
take
--
do
not
take
position
in
this
case.
we
are
not
saying
that
we
are
defeating
a
state
action
by
invoking
a
federal
defense.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
no
law
but
federal
law
under
which
you
can
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce
claim
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
say
that
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
questions
of
violence
in
mass
picketing
and
that's
all
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
reach.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
been.
i
think
you
would
have
an
additional
question
in
that
circumstances
to
whether
the
federal
court
--
the
state
courts
on
doubt
of
the
violence
aspect
whether
that
would
on
removal
empower
to
federal
court
to
say
“well
since
it's
got
hold
part
of
this
controversy
let
it
dispose
the
whole
of
it
and
remand
on
that
ground.”
but
aside
from
such
a
question,
i
think
it
would
be
clearly
removable
in
ignorance.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
a
303
action?
not
offhand
sir,
i
couldn't
answer
that
question.
now
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
was
a
federal
court
303.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
remember
correctly,
but
this
is
really
off
the
top
of
my
hat.
this
court
decided
either
in
gibbs
or
in
another
case
that
you
could
not
have
punitive
damages
in
a
section
303
action,
but
that
is
clearly
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
thought
that
by
the
time
this
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
but
i'm
just
reminded
that
morten
saw,
this
court
decided
that
you
couldn't
award
punitive
damages
in
a
section
303
action
and
my
recollection
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
with
respect
to
the
violence,
but
not
with
respect
for
example
to
a
claim
of
a
303
claim.
mr.
bernard
dunau
gibbs
had
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
sorry
i
just
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
with
respect
to
the
arising
under
requirement,
i
think
that
what
this
court
said
in
machinist
v.
central
airlines
controls
here,
the
labor
management
relations
act,
section
301
contract
is
a
federal
contract
and
is
therefore
governed
and
enforceable
by
federal
law,
and
i
think
that
ends
the
question
of
arising
under
in
this
case.
now
if
we
were
in
this
case,
now
i
should
add
this
one
word
before
i
leave
the
removal
subject,
we
think
the
removal
of
a
section
301
action
fits
the
purpose
of
congress
in
providing
for
removal.
the
object
of
removal
when
you
have
questions,
the
federal
questions
which
is
at
the
foundation
of
the
claim
is
to
give
a
defendant
an
opportunity
to
bring
it
into
a
federal
court
just
as
the
plaintiff
has
an
opportunity
to
bring
that
same
case
into
a
federal
court
by
bringing
it
into
the
federal
court
in
the
first
instance.
both
are
supposed
to
have
access
to
a
federal
court
and
the
object
of
giving
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
access
to
a
federal
court
is
to
get
lower
interpretation
and
fact
determination
by
an
independent
federal
judiciary.
it
promotes
uniformity.
it
promotes
informed
adjudication
and
it
promotes
an
unparochial
administration
of
federal
law
and
we
think
that
that
idea
is
as
much
needed
in
a
section
301
action
as
in
any
other,
and
is
as
much
needed
whether
a
strike
injunction
is
sought
or
is
not
sought.
now
if
this
court
were
to
reach
the
question
of
the
power
of
a
state
court
to
issue
a
strike
injunction,
we
think
that
the
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair
is
that
a
federal
--
a
state
court
like
a
federal
court
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
and
for
this
reason.
when
this
court
decided
sinclair,
it
had
to
face
the
question
whether
the
enactment
of
section
301
impliedly
repealed
the
norris-laguardia
act.
this
court
concluded
that
it
did
not
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
it
rejected
the
argument
that
a
strike
injunction
was
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
it
said
with
respect
to
the
--
it
rejected
the
view
“that
injunctions
against
peaceful
strikes
are
necessary
to
make
the
arbitration
process
effective.
”whatever
might
be
said
about
the
merits
of
this
argument,
congress
itself
has
rejected
it.
in
doing
so,
it
set
the
limit
to
which
it
was
willing
to
go
in
permitting
courts
to
effectuate
the
congressional
policy
favoring
arbitration,
and
it
is
not
this
court's
business
to
review
the
wisdom
of
that
decision.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
once
that
it
was
decided
that
in
the
enforcement
of
this
federal
right,
congress
concluded
that
a
strike
injunction
was
not
necessary,
was
not
important
to
the
enforcement
of
that
right,
congress
could
not
have
made
a
different
determination
of
that
question
just
because
the
suit
was
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
that
is
virtually
conceded
by
all.
there
is
no
case
where
--
there
is
one
case
where
when
there
was
a
jointer
of
an
action
for
damages
with
a
strike
injunction,
the
federal
court
remanded
the
action
part
and
retained
the
--
the
federal
court
remanded
the
strike
injunction
aspect
of
the
action
and
retained
the
damage
action.
but
the
current
authority
is
virtually
uniform
that
whether
--
whenever
you
either
have
damages
alone
or
conjoined
damages
with
a
request
for
a
strike
injunction,
the
action
is
removable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
none.
mr.
bernard
dunau
now
we
think
that
when
congress
made
the
determination
that
a
strike
injunction
was
not
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise,
it
could
not
have
said
that
it
is
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise
if
you
bring
your
action
in
a
state
court,
but
it
is
not
important
if
you
bring
your
action
in
a
federal
court.
the
ideal
in
the
administration
of
section
301
is
uniformity.
it
is
not
a
fetish,
but
it
is
an
ideal.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir
because
violence
is
a
matter
which
is
within
a
state
court
jurisdiction
and
as
to
which
state
law
continues
to
be
applicable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
does
not
arise
under
federal
court,
precisely
sir.
now
it
may
the
federal
defenses
may
come
in
but
we
would
not
say
that
it
would
arise
under
federal
law.
now
there
maybe
outlandish
restrictions,
for
example,
on
picketing
as
a
result,
and
then
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
getting
into
a
first
amendment
area.
we'd
also
be
getting
into
the
question
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
these
would
be
matters
of
defense
that
we
could
not
remove
because
of
anticipatory
federal
defenses.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
i
ought
to
them
differentiates
three
separate
situations.
one,
if
there
is
violence
alone
it
is
not
removable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
actions
are
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
hard
to
imagine
violence
associated
from
someone
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
dispute.
if
we
had
only
a
claim
for
a
breach
of
contract
which
is
the
kind
of
suit
we
have
here,
it
is
always
removed.
and
if
we
have
an
ad
mix
claim,
i
think
we
then
begin
to
have
problems
under
the
--
of
(c)
of
1441
as
to
whether
these
are
independent
claims
and
should
be
remanded
or
removed,
but
these
are
special
problems
which
arise
only
because
of
the
ad
mixture
of
two
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
i
think
would
be
correct,
yes
sir.
now
i
said
that
the
ideal
that
the
court
seeks
and
the
congress
seeks
and
the
administration
of
section
301
is
uniformity
and
if
that
is
the
ideal,
you
can
not
have
uniformity
if
you
have
a
strike
injunction
attainable
in
a
state
court
but
not
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
departed
from
the
ideal
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
an
ideal,
it's
not
a
fetish.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
that
the
court
could
have
decided
it
the
other
way
and
then
would
have
had
a
very
difficult
problem
of
formulating
what
shall
be
the
rule
of
limitations
if
it
is
a
federal
rule
which
shall
be
uniform
throughout
country
shall
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
i
assume
sir
that
five
votes
takes
a
lot
of
thinking
before
justices
vote,
and
so
that
i
don't
suppose
it's
quite
so
easy
before
the
vote
gets
cast.
however,
i
think
you
had
two
things
in
hughes
which
quite
clearly
differentiated
from
this
case
here.
one
traditionally
where
congress
does
not
specify
a
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
reference
to
the
state
law,
and
in
that
posture
i
think
the
court
would
then
be
faced
with
the
question,
why
should
we
innovate
a
different
general
rule
in
a
section
301
action
and
conclude
it
that
the
impact
of
a
state
by
state
statute
of
limitations
didn't
encroach
so
severely
on
administration
of
section
301
action
as
to
require
a
departure
from
the
general
rule.
i
don't
think
that
same
kind
of
analysis
can
hold
water
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
not
only
do
you
have
lack
of
uniformity
from
state
court
to
federal
court,
you
have
lack
of
uniformity
from
one
state
to
another.
in
maryland
there
are
no
strike
injunctions.
in
the
district
of
columbia
you
could
not
get
a
strike
injunction.
in
virginia
you
can
if
you
had
a
strike
straddling,
those
three
localities
your
strike
would
be
partially
enjoinable
in
one
place
but
not
in
the
other.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
uniformity
which
this
court
generally
seeks
could
not
be
achieved
and
then
our
question
becomes,
does
it
matter
that
there
is
no
uniformity
with
respect
to
a
strike
injunction?
and
on
that
i
think
our
industrial
history
has
made
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
things
which
is
basic
to
a
labor
dispute
is
to
whether
a
strike
is
won
or
lost,
is
to
whether
you
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
you
do
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
certainly
would
not
disagree
with
that
expression
of
federal
labor
policy.
it
leads
us
to
ask
however
an
additional
question,
one
which
we
think
the
court
answered
in
sinclair
certainly
for
the
federal
courts
and
which
we
think
must
also
be
answered
the
same
way
for
the
state
courts.
is
it
true
that
congress
thought
that
a
strike
injunction
was
important
to
the
peaceful
adjustment
of
disputes
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
and
while
it's
taken
as
datum
on
one
side
of
the
table
that
it
is
important,
we
think
that
we
have
a
powerful
argument
that
it
is
really
not
important
that
what
makes
collective
bargaining
work
and
what
makes
grievance
and
arbitration
adjustment
work
is
the
self
commitment
of
the
parties
to
it.
you
could
throw
out
section
301
and
i
think
you
could
throw
out
state
law
and
this
system
would
still
work.
but
aside
from
all
this,
it
grew
up
and
it
flourished
before
there
was
any
law
really
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
matter.
what
we
suggest
on
that
aspect
of
the
matter
is
when
we
balance
our
competing
considerations,
if
legal
sanctions
are
important,
we've
got
legal
sanctions
aside
from
strike
injunctions,
the
discharge
or
discipline
of
strikers
is
no
means
sanctioned
for
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
the
recovery
of
damages
is
no
means
sanctioned
in
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
the
abuses
to
which
we
know
strike
injunctions
have
been
and
are
subject
is
no
mean
consideration
in
determining
whether
we
are
going
to
loose
more
by
having
a
strike
injunction
than
we're
going
to
pay
benefit
by
getting
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
because
i
suppose
there
may
be
lawyers
who
would
feel
that
in
a
particular
state
court
with
particular
state
judges
that
they
would
get
a
more
understanding
adjudication
of
their
problem
than
they
would
get
before
a
particular
federal
judge,
and
therefore
would
not
remove
so
it
could
still
come
up.
i
would
suppose,
realistically,
that
these
actions
are
going
to
be
removed
by
any
lawyer
who's
informed
on
the
subject.
now
what
we
do
suggest
however
with
respect
to
the
competing
considerations
as
to
whether
their
strike
injunction
is
desirable
or
is
undesirable,
when
you
get
all
through
with
marshaling
them,
i
think
you
come
out
with
the
question
for
the
people
across
the
street
and
a
question
here.
that
was
true
when
sinclair
was
decided.
i
think
it
is
even
more
true
five
and
a
half
years
from
sinclair
there
has
been
no
action
by
congress
on
this
subject.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
bills
introduced
and
nothing
has
been
done,
and
we
think
therefore
it
might
be
just
as
well
to
embrace
what
seems
to
be
the
congressional
judgment
to
leave
well
enough
alone.
mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
an
employer
claims
that
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
strike
takes
place
in
violation
of
the
no
strike
commitment.
based
on
that
claim
of
contract
violation,
he
brings
a
suit
in
a
state
court
and
requests
a
strike
injunction
as
relief
for
the
contract
violation.
the
union
removes
that
action
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court
and
our
only
question
is
whether
that
action
is
properly
removed.
now
that
action
is
properly
removed
if
two
requirements
of
removal
are
met.
one,
the
action
must
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court,
and
two,
the
action
must
be
founded
on
a
claim
or
right
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
now
with
respect
to
the
requirement,
the
arising
under
requirement,
a
--
when
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce
that
an
action
for
violation
of
that
agreement
must
rest
on
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
there
is
no
other
law
on
which
that
action
can
be
based.
there
is
no
law,
but
federal
law
which
can
be
invoked
with
respect
to
a
claimed
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
true
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
a
state
court,
if
the
action
stayed
in
the
state
court
would
have
the
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction,
because
the
state
court
on
that
hypothesis
would
have
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
only
because
the
federal
law
said
it
had
that
authority.
whether
or
not
the
state
court
can
issue
a
strike
injunction
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
so
which
ever
way
this
action
is
sliced,
it
can
only
arise
under
our
law
--
under
a
--
it
can
only
arise
under
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
question
is
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
we
do,
only
because
we
cannot
be
entirely
sure
what
--
(inaudible)
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
be
delighted
if
you
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
decided
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
though
authority,
the
issue
will
strike
it
judge,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
no
response
of
pleading
was
ever
filed
in
the
tennessee
action
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
certainly
would
have
claimed
that
federal
law
precludes
a
state
from
issuing
a
strike
injunction
in
a
suit
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
yes
sir.
now
the
other
question
necessary
to
removal
requirement
we
must
satisfy
is
that
the
action
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
original
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court,
we
have
i
think
a
very
plain
setting.
a
federal
court
has
the
power
decide
contract
claims,
violations,
alleged
violations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
a
federal
court,
if
it
defines
that
there
has
been
a
contract
violation
is
empowered
as
the,
whatever
if
that
is
the
appropriate
remedy
to
compel
arbitration,
to
confirm
or
vacate
an
arbitration
award,
to
render
a
money
judgment,
to
render
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
one
thing
it
may
not
do
by
reason
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
to
issue
a
strike
injunction.
and
our
sole
question
therefore
with
respect
to
the
requirement
of
original
jurisdiction
is
whether
the
lack
of
authority
of
a
federal
court
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
is
a
divestiture
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
is
a
limitation
of
equity
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
solely
a
limitation
of
equity
jurisdiction
that
is
not
the
kind
of
lack
original
jurisdiction
of
which
the
removal
statute
speaks.
if
it's
a
limitation
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
then
we
cannot
remove
this
type
of
action.
now
the
norris-laguardia
act
aside,
it
is
crystal
clear
that
a
limitation
upon
the
power
of
a
federal
court
or
the
authority
of
a
federal
court
to
issue
an
injunction
is
--
does
not
go
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court.
it
goes
to
equity
jurisdiction.
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
claim.
if
that
is
correct,
then
what
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
is,
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
itself
make
an
alteration
in
that
analysis.
and
the
sole
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
said
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
itself
relates
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
rather
than
equity
jurisdiction,
it
is
because
the
norris-laguardia
act
talks
in
the
language
of
jurisdiction.
but
the
talk
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
language
jurisdiction
is
just
as
fully
explicable
as
a
reference
to
equity
jurisdiction
and
much
more
clearly
a
reference
to
equity
jurisdiction
than
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
every
place
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
the
word
jurisdiction
is
used,
one
can
insert
equity
jurisdiction
and
make
no
slightest
alteration
in
the
sense
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
norris-laguardia
act.
let's
take
a
look
the
statute.
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
say
that
a
federal
court
is
not
empowered
to
adjudicate
controversies
arising
out
of
or
involving
labor
disputes.
what
it
says
is
that
you
have
such
a
controversy,
therefore
a
federal
court
you
can
not
get
injunctive
relief
unless
you
satisfy
certain
prerequisites.
this
statute,
the
norris-laguardia
act
begins
with
a
public
policy
which
expresses
national
labor
policy.
it
was
enacted
in
1932.
in
1935
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
same
virtually
in
so
many
words,
the
same
national
labor
policy
expressed
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
expressed
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
therefore
deal
with
a
statute
which
is
(inaudible)
on
congress'
recognition
in
its
view
of
what
was
important
to
national
labor
policy.
this
statute
has
substantive
import.
on
its
face,
it
outlaws
the
“yellow
dog
contract”.
on
its
face
it
prescribes
rules
with
respect
to
vicarious
responsibility.
it
has
requirements
which
are
--
which
pertain
to
traditional
equity
practice,
the
requirement
of
substantial
irreparable
injury,
the
requirement
of
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
it
has
procedural
requirements.
before
you
can
get
an
injunction
you
have
to
have
a
bond.
before
you
can
get
an
injunction
findings
of
fact
must
be
made.
now
it
says
that
certain
acts
under
no
circumstances
will
be
enjoined,
this
strike
being
preeminent
illustration,
but
even
in
describing
certain
non-enjoinable
acts
is
carefully
qualified.
you
cannot
restrain
picketing
or
other
publication
of
a
labor
dispute
unless
there's
fraud
or
violence.
you
cannot
prohibit
assembly
unless
it's
unlawful.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
entirety
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
necessarily
speaks
not
of
a
divestiture
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
the
controversy
but
a
circumscription
of
the
manner
in
which
it
will
exercise
that
power.
now
we
didn't
invent
this
distinction
between
equity
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
we
didn't
invent
its
application
to
the
norris-laguardia
act.
throughout
the
passage,
the
deliberations
in
congress
which
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
legislative
refrain
was,
we
are
dealing
with
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
for
example
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
congressman
bank
(ph)
speaking.
he
says
of
the
bill
which
became
the
norris-laguardia
act
“it
does
not
undertake
to
withdraw
from
the
federal
judiciary,
any
of
its
functions
in
equity,
but
it
nearly
imposes
conditions
upon
them
and
restraints
upon
them
with
reference
to
the
issuance
of
injunctions
and
labor
disputes.”
and
in
the
house
bill,
there
was
attached
a
memorandum
by
then
professor
felix
frankfurter
which
described
in
detail
the
constitutional
power
that
congress
would
be
exercising
in
the
enactment
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
in
that
memorandum
then
professor
frankfurter
said
“the
congress
would
be
exercising
its
power
over
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.”
and
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
bakery
drivers
workers
union
v.
wagshal
said
“the
question
is
whether
the
complaint
subjects
the
court
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
upon
its
equity
jurisdiction.”
we
think
therefore
that
clearly
this
action
meets
the
two
requirements
for
removal.
one
that
the
action
arise
under
a
law
of
the
united
states,
there
is
no
other
under
which
it
can
arise
in
this
case
and
two
that
it
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
because
the
only
limitation
in
this
case
pertains
to
the
equity
jurisdiction
and
that
is
not
a
requirement
which
goes
to
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
only
sir
if
one
takes
the
position
that
if
a
complaint
is
silent,
it
does
not
mention
section
301
then
there
exists
somehow
a
state
law
which
may
still
be
invoked.
mr.
bernard
dunau
you
do
not
need
to
mention
301
but
your
silence
on
the
subject
doesn't
remove
301
as
being
the
only
law
under
which
such
an
action
can
arise.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
thought
that
that
was
settled
with
respect
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
it
does.
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
this
court
said
in
an
international
association
of
machinist
v.
central
airlines
when
it
discussed
not
a
301
action,
or
a
301
contract,
but
when
it
discussed
a
section
301
railway
labor
act
contract,
it
was
the
same
question
under
a
301
contract
as
under
a
railway
labor
act
contract
as
the
action
arise
under
federal
law
or
under
the
state
law,
it
is
true
that
in
the
central
airlines
case
the
action
was
initially
begun
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
the
same
question
whether
the
--
or
the
arising
under
question
is
the
same
whether
you're
concerned
with
does
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
if
the
action
is
brought
originally
in
the
federal
court,
or
does
it
have
jurisdiction
on
removal.
and
this
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
no,
in
the
sense
that
if
you
in
truth
could
allege
a
state
action
but
the
result
of
that
action
would
be,
or
the
aim
of
that
action
would
be
defeated
by
bringing
in
federal
law
as
a
defense.
and
if
in
that
sense
that
action
is
controlled,
it
doesn't
arise
under,
but
we
have
no
such
or
we
certainly
take
--
do
not
take
position
in
this
case.
we
are
not
saying
that
we
are
defeating
a
state
action
by
invoking
a
federal
defense.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
no
law
but
federal
law
under
which
you
can
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce
claim
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
say
that
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
questions
of
violence
in
mass
picketing
and
that's
all
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
reach.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
been.
i
think
you
would
have
an
additional
question
in
that
circumstances
to
whether
the
federal
court
--
the
state
courts
on
doubt
of
the
violence
aspect
whether
that
would
on
removal
empower
to
federal
court
to
say
“well
since
it's
got
hold
part
of
this
controversy
let
it
dispose
the
whole
of
it
and
remand
on
that
ground.”
but
aside
from
such
a
question,
i
think
it
would
be
clearly
removable
in
ignorance.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
a
303
action?
not
offhand
sir,
i
couldn't
answer
that
question.
now
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
was
a
federal
court
303.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
remember
correctly,
but
this
is
really
off
the
top
of
my
hat.
this
court
decided
either
in
gibbs
or
in
another
case
that
you
could
not
have
punitive
damages
in
a
section
303
action,
but
that
is
clearly
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
thought
that
by
the
time
this
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
but
i'm
just
reminded
that
morten
saw,
this
court
decided
that
you
couldn't
award
punitive
damages
in
a
section
303
action
and
my
recollection
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
with
respect
to
the
violence,
but
not
with
respect
for
example
to
a
claim
of
a
303
claim.
mr.
bernard
dunau
gibbs
had
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
sorry
i
just
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
with
respect
to
the
arising
under
requirement,
i
think
that
what
this
court
said
in
machinist
v.
central
airlines
controls
here,
the
labor
management
relations
act,
section
301
contract
is
a
federal
contract
and
is
therefore
governed
and
enforceable
by
federal
law,
and
i
think
that
ends
the
question
of
arising
under
in
this
case.
now
if
we
were
in
this
case,
now
i
should
add
this
one
word
before
i
leave
the
removal
subject,
we
think
the
removal
of
a
section
301
action
fits
the
purpose
of
congress
in
providing
for
removal.
the
object
of
removal
when
you
have
questions,
the
federal
questions
which
is
at
the
foundation
of
the
claim
is
to
give
a
defendant
an
opportunity
to
bring
it
into
a
federal
court
just
as
the
plaintiff
has
an
opportunity
to
bring
that
same
case
into
a
federal
court
by
bringing
it
into
the
federal
court
in
the
first
instance.
both
are
supposed
to
have
access
to
a
federal
court
and
the
object
of
giving
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
access
to
a
federal
court
is
to
get
lower
interpretation
and
fact
determination
by
an
independent
federal
judiciary.
it
promotes
uniformity.
it
promotes
informed
adjudication
and
it
promotes
an
unparochial
administration
of
federal
law
and
we
think
that
that
idea
is
as
much
needed
in
a
section
301
action
as
in
any
other,
and
is
as
much
needed
whether
a
strike
injunction
is
sought
or
is
not
sought.
now
if
this
court
were
to
reach
the
question
of
the
power
of
a
state
court
to
issue
a
strike
injunction,
we
think
that
the
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair
is
that
a
federal
--
a
state
court
like
a
federal
court
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
strike
injunction
and
for
this
reason.
when
this
court
decided
sinclair,
it
had
to
face
the
question
whether
the
enactment
of
section
301
impliedly
repealed
the
norris-laguardia
act.
this
court
concluded
that
it
did
not
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
it
rejected
the
argument
that
a
strike
injunction
was
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
it
said
with
respect
to
the
--
it
rejected
the
view
“that
injunctions
against
peaceful
strikes
are
necessary
to
make
the
arbitration
process
effective.
”whatever
might
be
said
about
the
merits
of
this
argument,
congress
itself
has
rejected
it.
in
doing
so,
it
set
the
limit
to
which
it
was
willing
to
go
in
permitting
courts
to
effectuate
the
congressional
policy
favoring
arbitration,
and
it
is
not
this
court's
business
to
review
the
wisdom
of
that
decision.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
once
that
it
was
decided
that
in
the
enforcement
of
this
federal
right,
congress
concluded
that
a
strike
injunction
was
not
necessary,
was
not
important
to
the
enforcement
of
that
right,
congress
could
not
have
made
a
different
determination
of
that
question
just
because
the
suit
was
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
that
is
virtually
conceded
by
all.
there
is
no
case
where
--
there
is
one
case
where
when
there
was
a
jointer
of
an
action
for
damages
with
a
strike
injunction,
the
federal
court
remanded
the
action
part
and
retained
the
--
the
federal
court
remanded
the
strike
injunction
aspect
of
the
action
and
retained
the
damage
action.
but
the
current
authority
is
virtually
uniform
that
whether
--
whenever
you
either
have
damages
alone
or
conjoined
damages
with
a
request
for
a
strike
injunction,
the
action
is
removable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
none.
mr.
bernard
dunau
now
we
think
that
when
congress
made
the
determination
that
a
strike
injunction
was
not
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise,
it
could
not
have
said
that
it
is
important
to
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise
if
you
bring
your
action
in
a
state
court,
but
it
is
not
important
if
you
bring
your
action
in
a
federal
court.
the
ideal
in
the
administration
of
section
301
is
uniformity.
it
is
not
a
fetish,
but
it
is
an
ideal.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir
because
violence
is
a
matter
which
is
within
a
state
court
jurisdiction
and
as
to
which
state
law
continues
to
be
applicable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
does
not
arise
under
federal
court,
precisely
sir.
now
it
may
the
federal
defenses
may
come
in
but
we
would
not
say
that
it
would
arise
under
federal
law.
now
there
maybe
outlandish
restrictions,
for
example,
on
picketing
as
a
result,
and
then
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
getting
into
a
first
amendment
area.
we'd
also
be
getting
into
the
question
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
these
would
be
matters
of
defense
that
we
could
not
remove
because
of
anticipatory
federal
defenses.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well
i
ought
to
them
differentiates
three
separate
situations.
one,
if
there
is
violence
alone
it
is
not
removable.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
actions
are
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
hard
to
imagine
violence
associated
from
someone
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
dispute.
if
we
had
only
a
claim
for
a
breach
of
contract
which
is
the
kind
of
suit
we
have
here,
it
is
always
removed.
and
if
we
have
an
ad
mix
claim,
i
think
we
then
begin
to
have
problems
under
the
--
of
(c)
of
1441
as
to
whether
these
are
independent
claims
and
should
be
remanded
or
removed,
but
these
are
special
problems
which
arise
only
because
of
the
ad
mixture
of
two
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
i
think
would
be
correct,
yes
sir.
now
i
said
that
the
ideal
that
the
court
seeks
and
the
congress
seeks
and
the
administration
of
section
301
is
uniformity
and
if
that
is
the
ideal,
you
can
not
have
uniformity
if
you
have
a
strike
injunction
attainable
in
a
state
court
but
not
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
departed
from
the
ideal
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
an
ideal,
it's
not
a
fetish.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
that
the
court
could
have
decided
it
the
other
way
and
then
would
have
had
a
very
difficult
problem
of
formulating
what
shall
be
the
rule
of
limitations
if
it
is
a
federal
rule
which
shall
be
uniform
throughout
country
shall
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
i
assume
sir
that
five
votes
takes
a
lot
of
thinking
before
justices
vote,
and
so
that
i
don't
suppose
it's
quite
so
easy
before
the
vote
gets
cast.
however,
i
think
you
had
two
things
in
hughes
which
quite
clearly
differentiated
from
this
case
here.
one
traditionally
where
congress
does
not
specify
a
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
reference
to
the
state
law,
and
in
that
posture
i
think
the
court
would
then
be
faced
with
the
question,
why
should
we
innovate
a
different
general
rule
in
a
section
301
action
and
conclude
it
that
the
impact
of
a
state
by
state
statute
of
limitations
didn't
encroach
so
severely
on
administration
of
section
301
action
as
to
require
a
departure
from
the
general
rule.
i
don't
think
that
same
kind
of
analysis
can
hold
water
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
not
only
do
you
have
lack
of
uniformity
from
state
court
to
federal
court,
you
have
lack
of
uniformity
from
one
state
to
another.
in
maryland
there
are
no
strike
injunctions.
in
the
district
of
columbia
you
could
not
get
a
strike
injunction.
in
virginia
you
can
if
you
had
a
strike
straddling,
those
three
localities
your
strike
would
be
partially
enjoinable
in
one
place
but
not
in
the
other.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
uniformity
which
this
court
generally
seeks
could
not
be
achieved
and
then
our
question
becomes,
does
it
matter
that
there
is
no
uniformity
with
respect
to
a
strike
injunction?
and
on
that
i
think
our
industrial
history
has
made
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
things
which
is
basic
to
a
labor
dispute
is
to
whether
a
strike
is
won
or
lost,
is
to
whether
you
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
you
do
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
certainly
would
not
disagree
with
that
expression
of
federal
labor
policy.
it
leads
us
to
ask
however
an
additional
question,
one
which
we
think
the
court
answered
in
sinclair
certainly
for
the
federal
courts
and
which
we
think
must
also
be
answered
the
same
way
for
the
state
courts.
is
it
true
that
congress
thought
that
a
strike
injunction
was
important
to
the
peaceful
adjustment
of
disputes
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
and
while
it's
taken
as
datum
on
one
side
of
the
table
that
it
is
important,
we
think
that
we
have
a
powerful
argument
that
it
is
really
not
important
that
what
makes
collective
bargaining
work
and
what
makes
grievance
and
arbitration
adjustment
work
is
the
self
commitment
of
the
parties
to
it.
you
could
throw
out
section
301
and
i
think
you
could
throw
out
state
law
and
this
system
would
still
work.
but
aside
from
all
this,
it
grew
up
and
it
flourished
before
there
was
any
law
really
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
matter.
what
we
suggest
on
that
aspect
of
the
matter
is
when
we
balance
our
competing
considerations,
if
legal
sanctions
are
important,
we've
got
legal
sanctions
aside
from
strike
injunctions,
the
discharge
or
discipline
of
strikers
is
no
means
sanctioned
for
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
the
recovery
of
damages
is
no
means
sanctioned
in
the
enforcement
of
a
no
strike
promise.
the
abuses
to
which
we
know
strike
injunctions
have
been
and
are
subject
is
no
mean
consideration
in
determining
whether
we
are
going
to
loose
more
by
having
a
strike
injunction
than
we're
going
to
pay
benefit
by
getting
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
because
i
suppose
there
may
be
lawyers
who
would
feel
that
in
a
particular
state
court
with
particular
state
judges
that
they
would
get
a
more
understanding
adjudication
of
their
problem
than
they
would
get
before
a
particular
federal
judge,
and
therefore
would
not
remove
so
it
could
still
come
up.
i
would
suppose,
realistically,
that
these
actions
are
going
to
be
removed
by
any
lawyer
who's
informed
on
the
subject.
now
what
we
do
suggest
however
with
respect
to
the
competing
considerations
as
to
whether
their
strike
injunction
is
desirable
or
is
undesirable,
when
you
get
all
through
with
marshaling
them,
i
think
you
come
out
with
the
question
for
the
people
across
the
street
and
a
question
here.
that
was
true
when
sinclair
was
decided.
i
think
it
is
even
more
true
five
and
a
half
years
from
sinclair
there
has
been
no
action
by
congress
on
this
subject.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
bills
introduced
and
nothing
has
been
done,
and
we
think
therefore
it
might
be
just
as
well
to
embrace
what
seems
to
be
the
congressional
judgment
to
leave
well
enough
alone.
