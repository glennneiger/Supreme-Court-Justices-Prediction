justice
abe
fortas
but
if
federal
law
applies
here,
i
assume
that
it
is
--
that
it
compels
the
decision
of
the
state
court.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
that
the
choice
of
forum
determines
which
law
applies?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
then
is
that
the
plaintiff
can
determine
where
the
federal
law
or
state
law
will
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we
should
conclude
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
that
federal
law
should
apply
here,
i
don't
assume
you
would
urge
that
despite
that,
the
plaintiff's
choice
would
govern?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
your
opening
statement
you
did
say
that
the
questions
in
the
present
case
were
expressly
reserved
in
dowd
in
the
last
footnote.
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
the
applicability
of
norris-laguardia.
justice
abe
fortas
if
an
action
for
damages
were
brought
against
the
union
for
breach
of
contract
in
the
state
court,
is
it
your
--
would
you
contend
that
that
could
be
removed?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
jurisdiction
that
would
be
left
to
the
state
court
not
subject
to
removal
to
the
federal
court?
justice
abe
fortas
none.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
probably
did
misunderstand
you
earlier,
because
i
thought
you
said
that
if
there
were
violence
and
suit
were
started
in
the
federal
--
in
the
state
court,
and
there
could
--
for
injunction
let's
say,
then
there
could
be
a
removal
to
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
court
would
also
take
the
issue
of
violence
as
in
on
the
pendent
jurisdiction
theory
which
i
think
some
third
paragraph
of
1441.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
you
mean
to
say
if
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
lawsuit
is
for
what,
the
damages
for
violence
alone
just
like
it's
an
action
for
damages
on
account
of
assault
and
battery
or
trespass
and
etcetera?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
that
would
be
kind
of
rare,
wouldn't
it,
in
these
disputes?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
so
actually
would
it
be
a
correct
summary
of
your
view
taking
in
to
account
your
previous
colloquy
with
me
and
the
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
brennan
that
your
argument
leads
us
to
the
position
that
state
courts
would
have
no
jurisdiction
that
would
be
immune
from
removal
to
the
federal
courts
except
possibly
a
simple,
plain
vanilla
action
for
damage
on
account
of
violence?
justice
