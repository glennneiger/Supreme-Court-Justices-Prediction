you're
not,
mr.
swigert
before
you
sit
down,
you're
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
the
sinclair
case
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
discuss
it
in
some
length
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
is
some
question
about
whether
the
original
action
arose
under
the
law
of
the
united
states,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
mention
301
in
the
state
court,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that.
when
does
this
court
ever
held
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
but
i
just
wondered
why?
justice
potter
stewart
plus
hughes
v.
cardinal
departed
from
that
ideal,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
it
were
an
ideal,
how
did
we
decide
hughes
v.
cardinal
the
way
we
did?
justice
potter
stewart
we
could've
very
easily
decided
it
the
way
we
were
asked
to
decide
it
in
conformity
with
the
ideal
that
you
now
suggest
should
be
the
touch
stone?
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
take
five
votes
in
this
court,
we
could
have
set
any
rule
of
limitations
you
wanted,
couldn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
this
court
had
said
many,
many
times
in
recent
years
that
the
real
basic
ideal
of
federal
labor
law
and
federal
labor
policy
is
the
peaceful,
orderly,
lawful
adjustment
of
labor
disputes
and
the
fostering
of
atmosphere
conducive
to
the
making
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
the
enforcement
thereof.
