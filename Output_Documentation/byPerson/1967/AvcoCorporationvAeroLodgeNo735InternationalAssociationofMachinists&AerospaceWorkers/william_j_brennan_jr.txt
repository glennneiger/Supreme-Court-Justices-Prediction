justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
tennessee
chancery
mr.
swigert,
do
these
things
ever
go
to
final
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
law
violations,
any
violence
in
the
picket
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
you
don't
think
it
goes
so
far,
mr.
swigert
as
saying
that
even
where
an
action
maybe
brought
in
a
state
court
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
substantive
federal
law,
whether
the
action
is
brought
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
while
you
mean
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
a
state
court
which
has
no
little
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
not
because
it
has
to
apply
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
grant
an
injunctive
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn't
--
the
union
did
not
take
that
position
as
i
understand
it,
they
took
no
position
did
it
in
the
tennessee
state
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
had,
i
gather,
that's
the
kind
of
response
to
pleading
you'd
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gibbs
i
gather
didn't
--
gibbs
was
a
303
but
a
federal
court
303.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
something
said
in
303
generally
about
in
case
of
violence
state
power
to
award
punitive
damages,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
if
there
were
violence,
i
take
it
in
that
very
situation
a
state
court
could
be
empowered,
would
it
not,
to
allow
punitive
damages?
it
would
not
be
a
303
action
it
would
be
a
state
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
that
gibbs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean
don't
waste
your
time
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dunau,
may
i?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
confess,
did
you
in
answering
mr.
justice
fortas,
embrace
a
suit
where
actually
there
had
been
violence
and
violence
alleged
and
injunctive
relief
or
damages
based
on
violence
were
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
not
be
removed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
you'll
be
getting
into
first
amendment
area
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
if
this
view
prevails
that
this
action
is
removable,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
will
probably
never
see
a
case
where
we
have
to
test
the
authority
of
the
state
court
to
issue
a
strike,
except
in
violence
cases,
would
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
tennessee
chancery
mr.
swigert,
do
these
things
