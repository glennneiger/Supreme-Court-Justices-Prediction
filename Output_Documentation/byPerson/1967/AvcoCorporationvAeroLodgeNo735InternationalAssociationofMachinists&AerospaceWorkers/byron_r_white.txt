justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
--
there's
no
doubt
that
it
encroached
on
the
state
courts
in
the
sense
that
the
applicable
law
was
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
some
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
to
suggest
that
if
the
suit
on
the
contract
that
is
brought
on
the
state
court
and
301
is
never
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
still
has
a
suit
on
a
collective
bargaining
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
fact
301
itself
doesn't
even
mention
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
would
be
no
--
is
there
any
really
--
does
anybody
every
mention301
on
suing
on
a
collective
bargaining
contract
in
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
anybody
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
position
critical
to
this
case
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
you're
going
to
make
the
same
--
even
if
you
said
that
the
substantive
law
governing
suits
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
in
state
courts
is
federal
law.
even
if
you
said
that
you're
going
to
be
making
the
same
argument
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
you
just
had
asked
to
go
injunction
of
this
suit
for
damage
in
state
court,
not
asking
301
or
anything
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would've
had
been
removed
from
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
need
to
decide
here
in
this
case,
do
we,
whether
a
state
court
may
issue
that
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
delighted
if
we
did
decide
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
just
because
the
federal
law
is
--
applies
to
suits
on
collective
bargaining
contracts
doesn't
mean
that
it
arises
under
301?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
does
it
mean
that
it
arises
under
federal
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdictional
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
rather
the
removal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
same
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
just
the
fact
that
the
federal
law
might
control
a
case
doesn't
mean
it
arises
under
as
a
general
proposition,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
would
you
say
that
--
what
would
you
say
if
this
case
had
--
if
this
complaint
had
alleged
violence
or
mass
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
been
removable?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
have
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
state
courts
may
award
to
punitive
damages
in
303
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
recall
any
cases
in
the
--
that
have
been
decided
in
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
it
does
not
arise
and
that
sort
of
nature
would
arise
under
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
--
there's
no

that
it

in
