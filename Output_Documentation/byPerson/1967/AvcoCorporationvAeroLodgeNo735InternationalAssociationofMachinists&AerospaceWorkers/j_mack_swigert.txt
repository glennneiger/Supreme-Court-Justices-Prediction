mr.
j.
mack
swigert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
two
questions
that
were
reserved
by
this
court
in
footnote
8
of
the
dowd
box
decision,
is
a
suit
filed
in
state
court
to
enjoin
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract
now
removable,
and
due
to
restraints
of
norris-laguardia,
now
applied
to
state
courts
as
well
as
to
federal
courts.
this
petitioner
operates
a
defense
plant
at
nashville,
tennessee
and
they
make
in
that
plant
components
for
airplanes
used
by
the
defense
forces
of
the
united
states.
there
are
about
2000
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
and
these
employees
are
represented
by
the
respondents.
the
petitioner
has
a
contract
with
the
respondents,
a
three-year
contract
which
contains
a
categorical
unconditioned
no
strike
clause
effective
for
the
duration
to
the
agreement.
also
it
has
the
quid
pro
quo,
it
has
a
grievance
procedure
terminating
in
binding
arbitration.
in
the
summer
of
1965,
shortly
after
this
contract
was
executed,
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
covered
by
the
contract
including
local
union
officials
commenced
a
series
of
work
stoppages
and
interruptions
of
work
in
this
defense
plant.
the
first
stoppage
occurred
on
july
29,
1965
in
one
department
and
lasted
for
a
short
period
of
time.
thereafter,
from
time
to
time
work
stoppages
occurred
in
other
departments
of
the
plant,
one
department
after
another,
interruptions
that
bottlenecked
production
in
the
plant.
finally,
on
october
14,
1965
a
picket
line
was
placed
in
front
of
the
whole
plant,
and
the
on
the
following
morning
the
morning
of
october
15,
after
this
sort
of
interference
had
been
going
on
for
two
and
a
half
months
the
whole
plant
was
finally
shut
down
by
a
massive
picket
line.
not
until
then
did
this
petitioner
seek
injunctive
relief
and
on
october
15
they
went
into
the
chancery
court,
davidson
county,
tennessee
and
it
filed
its
bill
of
complaint
seeking
a
temporary
injunction.
the
court
granted
the
injunction,
people
went
back
to
work
and
the
respondents
did
nothing
for
another
20
days.
at
that
time
they
filed
their
petition
to
remove
this
case
to
the
district
court.
subsequently,
about
a
week
later
they
moved
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction.
of
course
we
filed
our
petition
to
remand
pointing
out
to
the
district
judge
that
we
had
filed
our
case
under
tennessee
law.
we
had
not
alleged
federal
law,
we
had
not
intended
to
invoke
federal
law,
but
tennessee
law.
nevertheless,
the
district
judge
after
considering
the
matter
for
several
months
denied
our
application
to
remand.
he
dissolved
the
state
court
order.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
temporary
injunction
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
temporary
injunction,
it
was
a
fiat
it's
called
under
tennessee
chancery
practice,
and
simply
granted
our
application
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no,
well
your
honor
there
was
an
ex
parte
hearing
solely
because
the
union
didn't
choose
to
show
up.
they
were
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
notified
by
telephone
call
although
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other,
that's
the
fact.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
they
can
whether
anyone
ever
finds
it
necessary
to
go
to
file
a
hearing,
i
don't
know.
as
your
honor
knows
from
your
own
experience,
normally
when
a
temporary
injunction
is
issued,
the
union
--
if
the
union
goes
back
to
work
and
doesn't
seek
to
litigate
it
further,
the
matter
just
hangs
there.
but
here
there's
no
case
to
test
that
because
the
removal
took
place
before
any
further
proceedings
could
occur
in
the
tennessee
state
court.
now
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no,
no
your
honor,
this
was
a
peaceful
stoppage
and
we
allege
no
violation
of
law
in
the
petition.
we
simply
allege
breach
of
contract
and
we
allege
in
the
body
of
the
petition
that
the
--
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
under
the
equity
practice
of
tennessee.
now
in
order
to
--
well
this
--
i
might
add
that
the
district
judge
told
you
his
action
and
then
the
case
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
they
affirmed
the
action
of
the
district
judge
in
their
opinion
they
stated
that
attempting
to
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
and
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills,
they
said
that
in
enacting
section
301,
congress
had
preempted,
totally
preempted
the
field
of
breach
contract,
the
contract
violation
and
that
therefore
our
suit
necessarily
arose
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
cause
even
though
because
of
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia,
it
couldn't
grant
us
the
relief
that
we
sought,
and
the
only
relief
that
we
sought.
now
in
order
to
understand
this
case
and
arrive
at
a
correct
decision,
i
respectfully
submit,
we
must
first
throw
our
minds
to
the
spring
of
1947
immediately
before
congress
enacted
the
labor
management
relations
act.
and
at
that
time
it
is
undisputed
first
of
all
that
state
courts
of
equity
could
enjoin
strikes
in
breach
of
contract
that
they
were
doing
it
in
many
states.
that
congress
knew
this
and
that
such
proceedings
were
not
removable
under
1441
(b).
also
it
is
undisputed
that
at
that
time
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia
did
not
apply
to
state
courts
or
their
injunctive
orders
that's
where
we
start.
and
so
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
301
intended
to
change
any
of
that.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelming,
the
legislative
history
is
overwhelming,
that
congress
had
no
intention
to
change
any
of
those
three
things.
they
had
no
intention
to
stop
state
courts
from
enjoining
strikes
in
breach
of
contract.
they
had
no
intention
to
make
such
proceedings
removable
under
1441
(b)
or
anything
else
and
they
had
no
intention
to
extend
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia
to
these
state
court
proceedings.
in
fact
the
intention
of
congress
was
precisely
the
contrary.
congress
intended
that
these
state
court
remedies
would
continue
to
operate
and
they
simply
supplemented
the
existing
state
court
remedies
with
one
more
remedy.
now
why
did
they
do
that?
they
did
it
because
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
in
1947,
with
seeing
these
agreements
enforced
and
they
were
concerned
by
evidence
in
legislative
hearings
that
there
were
gaps
in
the
law
of
many
states
because
of
the
diversity
problem
and
--
the
problem
are
not
diversity,
but
the
problem
of
being
unable
to
sue
unions
as
an
additive.
the
fact
that
you
had
to
sue
everybody
in
an
unincorporated
association
and
for
other
reasons
there
were
gaps
in
the
enforcement
of
these
contracts
among
the
states.
and
congress
wanted
to
assure
that
there'd
be
at
least
one
remedy
in
every
state
available
to
employers
and
the
unions
for
the
enforcement
of
these
agreements.
so
they
overlaid
an
additional
remedy,
but
they
did
not
disturb
the
existing
or
intend
to
disturb
the
existing
the
state
court
procedures
and
remedies.
now
this
is
clear
i
think
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
based
on
this
legislative
history.
this
court
for
example
held
in
dowd
and
stated
in
dowd
that
congress
manifested
its
complete
awareness
of
both
the
existence
and
the
limitations
of
state
court
remedies
for
violation
of
collective
agreements.
they
knew
all
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
states,
they
knew
they
were
enjoined.
senator
taft
himself
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
the
argument
that
“i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
law
against
courts
issuing
injunctions.”
of
course
a
court
may
always
issue
an
injunction
in
connection
with
the
lawsuit
except
as
limited
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
of
course
that
limitation
at
that
time
applied
only
to
federal
courts.
so
they
knew
about
the
injunctions.
now
what
was
their
intention?
this
court
has
stated
in
dowd
reviewing
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
not
to
limit,
but
to
expand
to
the
availability
of
forums
for
the
enforcement
of
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations.
the
court
stated
in
hughes
v.
cardinal
that
the
purpose
of
conferring
jurisdiction
under
federal
courts
was
not
to
displace
but
to
supplement
the
thoroughly
considered
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
various
states
over
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations.
and
subsequently
in
again
in
dowd,
the
court
said
in
enacting
section
301
congress
did
not
intend
to
deprive
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
right
to
seek
redress
of
its
violation
in
an
appropriate
state
tribunal.
they
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
take
away
any
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts,
did
not
intend
to
encroach
in
any
way
on
the
state
courts.
this
is
the
finding
of
this
court
and
it's
based
on
undisputed
legislative
history.
so
we
must
conclude
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
leave
the
existing
state
remedies
in
effect.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i'm
coming
to
that
point
and
i'll
be
there
right
now,
your
honor.
congress
did
enact
section
301
and
it
said
that
suits
for
violation
of
labor
context
may,
maybe
filed
in
federal
courts.
and
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
decisions
that
by
this
language,
congress
did
intend
to
create
a
substantive
body
of
law
to
be
enforced
as
a
federal
right
and
not
simply
a
creation
of
a
forum
to
enforce
state
law.
there's
no
question
about
that
your
honor,
but
--
and
this
court
has
further
held
that
in
fashioning
the
law
to
be
applied
in
federal
court
or
under
301
procedures,
this
court
will
fashion
a
law
and
you
will
adopt
law
that
is
not
incompatible,
state
court
rules
that
are
not
incompatible
with
national
policy.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
but
i'm
reaching
that
point
and
this
is
my
next
point.
congress
did
create
this
law,
it
did
empower
you
to
fashion
a
substantive
law
and
you
have
done
it.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
but
it
did
not
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
if
it's
brought
in
a
state
court
under
301,
but
what
if
the
petitioner
doesn't
elect
to
bring
his
action
into
state
court
under
301?
he
can
because
federal
law
can
be
enforced
in
state
courts.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
apply
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes
your
honor,
i've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
have
brought
--
well
i
won't
say
many
times
but
you
can,.
i've
seen
litigants
do
it,
but
we
didn't.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
i
don't
think
you'd
be
very
well
advised
to
do
it
in
view
of
the
suggestion
now
that
that
automatically
makes
it
removable.
but
my
--
position
is
that
our
two
coexisting
of
systems
of
law
for
enforcing
of
contract
now
because
otherwise
all
of
this
language
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
deprive
--
didn't
even
intend
to
deprive
a
party
of
their
right
to
seek
redress
for
its
violation
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
i
don't
i
think
it
necessarily
is.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes
sir,
this
is
an
additional
string
to
our
bow.
and
i
know
--
and
i
want
to
make
this
point,
because
this
is
not
been
considered
by
this
court
to
my
knowledge
heretofore
and
i
think
that
it
is
basic
in
reviewing
what
congress
intended
and
what
happened
here?
in
pan
american
petroleum
decided
several
years
ago
by
this
court,
it
was
held
of
course,
but
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
federal
remedy
created
by
congress,
but
the
plaintiff
elected
to
bring
his
pursuit
under
state
law.
and
of
course
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
in
the
state
court
and
saying
the
state,
that
matter
had
been
preempted,
the
federal
remedy
was
exclusive.
and
this
court
there
held
that
a
plaintiff
is
master
of
his
suit,
you
will
look
solely
to
the
language
of
the
petition
to
see
whether
he
elected
to
come
under
federal
law
or
a
state
law
that
there
the
petitioner,
even
though
there
was
a
federal
remedy
and
it
was
arguably
exclusive,
had
elected
to
come
under
state
law
by
his
petition
and
that
the
question
of
removability
doesn't
turn
on
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case
or
whether
the
plaintiff
was
right.
the
court
said
that
where
the
plaintiff
has
pitched
here
suit
under
state
law,
it
is
not
removable
because
he
has
not
alleged
something
that
arose
under
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
think
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
only
if
we
had
elected
to
file
that
suit
--
oh
but
that's
just
your
honor,
this
is
what
pan
american
says
and
what
(inaudible)
says
and
other
cases,
only
if
we
had
elected
and
stated
in
our
petition
that
we
were
bringing
the
suit
under
federal
law,
would
that
damage
suit
had
been
removable?
now
that
is
unnecessary
to
a
decision
of
this
case,
but
it
does
elucidate
the
theory
that
i
am
presenting
to
you
here.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
your
honor
my
point
is
that
federal
law
does
not
apply
here
because
we
brought
a
suit
under
state
law.
and
state
law
has
not
been
preempted
by
--
totally
preempted
by
301.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor,
not
the
choice
of
forum,
but
the
allegations
of
the
petition
and
that's
what
this
court
said
(inaudible)
it's
what
you
said
in
pan
american
petroleum
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
he
can
determine
what
law
he
wants
to
bring
his
suit
in.
we
determined
that
we
want
to
bring
ours
under
tennessee
law
and
nobody
--
and
the
tennessee
chancellor
impliedly
found
there
was
a
tennessee
law
still
because
he
granted
us
our
relief,
and
nobody
took
an
appeal
from
his
decision.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor,
but
up
to
now
the
court
has
determined
the
contrary.
the
court
has
determined
in
lucas
and
dowd
and
hughes
v.
cardinal
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
preempt
only
pro
tanto,
only
to
the
extent
that
local
rules
are
inconsistent
with
the
overriding
national
policy
as
set
forth
in
this
law.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
the
general
question
of
whether
a
state
court
suit
could
be
removable
was
reserved
and
this
is
a
facet
of
that
question,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
and
the
applicability
of
norris-laguardia,
yes
sir.
now
we
contend
that
if
the
lucas
and
dowd
and
hughes
v.
cardinal
mean
what
they
say,
and
incidentally
in
hughes
v.
cardinal
by
substantive
this
court
made
a
definition
and
the
definition
was
that
something
is
substantive
within
this
preemptive
concept
only
if
it
affects
the
formation
of
a
contract
with
a
private
settlement
of
disputes
under
that
contract.
anything
outside
that
area
is
not
preempted
that's
why
i
read
these
decisions.
now,
here
a
contract
had
been
formed
so
tennessee
law
didn't
affect
in
any
way
the
formation
of
the
contract,
and
the
private
settlement
of
disputes
as
set
up
in
that
contract
had
broken
down
just
as
they
had
in
hughes
v.
cardinal,
because
we're
in
court,
they
are
obviously
broken
down.
now
the
minute
we
get
into
that
area
of
remedy,
this
is
an
area
that
is
not
been
preempted
and
therefore
the
state
remedy
would
remain
in
effect
just
as
the
state
statute
of
limitations
was
recognized
as
effective
in
dowd.
now
it's
true
that
in
dowd,
the
suit
was
initiated
in
the
--
i
mean
in
hughes
v.
cardinal,
the
suit
was
initiated
in
the
federal
court
so
you
had
no
removal
problem
there
and
naturally
if
the
suit
is
brought
in
federal
court
it
can
only
be
brought
under
301
only
under
federal
law.
you
have
indicated
your
election
by
filing
this
suit
in
federal
court.
now
there's
one
more
point
here.
as
your
honors
have
suggested,
even
if
you
do
--
you
think
that
no
state
law
now
exists,
surely
we
were
entitled
to
allege
the
contrary.
we
didn't
attempt
or
purport
to
allege
a
federal
suit,
and
so
it
wouldn't
be
removable
if
we
were
wrong
and
alleged
only
a
state
cause
of
action.
that
wouldn't
make
it
removable.
we
can't
be
compelled
to
seek
a
federal
remedy
if
we
don't
want
one.
now,
however
even
if
federal
law,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
even
if
federal
law
is
considered
as
preempting
the
whole
substantive
field,
it
still
would
not
be
removable
because
even
if
the
tennessee
court
was
being
asked
by
us,
as
it
wasn't
to
apply
federal
law,
this
was
not
a
law
arising
under
laws
of
the
united
states
because
it
was
fashioned
law,
fashioned
by
the
federal
courts
and
adapted
from
the
states
and
so
it
was
created
by
the
states
and
not
the
courts
and
not
congress
and
it
would
not
arise
under
federal
in
any
event.
that
is
our
contention
as
set
forth
in
great
detail
in
our
brief.
now,
there's
a
second
facet
to
this
and
i
just
want
to
allude
to
this
briefly.
in
sinclair
this
court
has
held
that
congress
in
enacting
301
simply
intended
to
leave
norris-laguardia
the
way
it
was.
and
it
didn't
intend
to
make
any
exemptions
to
it,
just
continue
it.
well,
the
way
it
was,
it
didn't
apply
to
state
court
injunction
proceedings,
and
we
contend
therefore
that
a
federal
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
original
jurisdiction
over
a
suit
to
enjoin
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract.
norris-laguardia
of
course
was
enacted
back
in
1932
before
the
merger
of
law
in
equity
in
federal
courts.
at
that
time
we
had
an
equity
side
and
a
law
side,
and
these
injunction
suits
had
to
be
brought
under
the
equity
side.
so
congress
was
concerned
obviously
only
with
withdrawing
jurisdiction
from
the
equity
side
of
the
court
and
any
reference
to
equity
in
the
legislative
history
arose
from
this
circumstance.
but
congress
did
use
the
big
word
jurisdiction
because
as
this
court
said
in
sinclair
they
wanted
to
use
the
biggest
possible
language
in
order
to
block
any
possibility
of
misconstruction
or
a
narrowing
construction
by
the
courts.
they
wanted
to
take
jurisdiction
away
from
federal
courts
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
we
say
they
did,
and
take
the
jurisdiction
away
and
if
that
is
true,
then
such
a
suit
would
not
be
removable
under
1441
(b).
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
we
did
not,
your
honor,
allege
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites
to
an
injunction
suit
under
federal
law
which
would
have
been
that
unlawful
acts
were
threatened
or
had
been
committed,
and
secondly
that
public
officers
charged
with
the
protection
of
property
could
not
or
would
not
protect.
this
is
no
--
neither
of
these
and
these
allegations
to
our
mind
are
like
a
$10,000.00
allegation
where
a
$10,000.00
minimum
is
required
for
federal
jurisdiction.
unless
you
allege
these
things,
you
have
not
stated,
you
have
not
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court
under
norris-laguardia,
and
we
didn't
allege
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
both
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
in
the
body
of
our
petition,
we
allege
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i'm
not
referring
to
the
prayer,
i'm
referring
of
our
petition,
i'm
referring
to
the
body
where
we
set
forth
the
facts
that
entitled
us
to
relief
under
tennessee
law.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
we,
as
i've
indicated
sought
to
invoke
only
tennessee
law,
not
federal
law,
and
unless
you
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
you
can
not
have
federal
relief.
you
can
not
state
a
federal
cause
of
action
unless
you
elect
to
do
that,
and
we
didn't
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
that
if
we
allege
the
facts
necessary
to
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
had
it
elected
by
the
language
of
our
petition
to
rely
on
the
federal
cause
of
action
then
the
fact
that
we
didn't
pray
for
injunctive
relief
would
not
mean
that
it
wasn't
the
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
decision
of
the
case,
because
in
sinclair
all
as
i
understand
--
i
consider
sinclair
an
authority
for
us
and
not
against
us
because
in
sinclair
you
specifically
stated
--
it
was
a
agreed
by
the
conferees
that
no
change
in
the
existing
and
the
injunction
provisions
of
norris-laguardia
should
be
made.
as
i
pointed
out
the
existing
restraints
applied
only
to
federal
courts,
we're
in
the
state
court.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
central
airlines
relied
on
with
the
respondents
turned
solely
on
the
intention
of
congress,
and
this
court
held
that
congress
intended
there
to
establish
an
exclusive
remedy,
but
here
congress
didn't.
and
let
me
draw
your
attention
very
briefly
to
the
legislative
history
once
again.
in
1947,
the
house
passed
a
bill
that
provided
for
enforcement
in
federal
district
courts
of
suits
for
violation
of
labor
contracts,
and
also
contained
a
specific
exception
to
norris-laguardia
to
cover
those
suits
in
federal
suits
and
that
was
the
bill
as
it
passed
the
house.
in
the
senate,
they
also
provided
for
injunctive
relief
on
the
original
bill.
they
provided
a
suit
in
federal
courts
and
they
also
provided
a
--
that
there
would
be
a
--
to
become
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
would
bring
it
under
section
10
(j)
of
the
act.
so
both
bills
originally
had
facility
to
enjoin
a
strike
against
breach
of
contract.
they'd
said
it
to
the
committee
and
the
committee
came
up
with
a
compromise
and
they
decided
to
drop
the
exception
to
norris-laguardia
out
of
the
house
bill,
and
to
drop
the
unfair
labor
practice
out
of
the
said
bill
on
the
representation
that
they
were
going
to
leave
the
enforcement
of
these
contracts
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.
now
those
usual
processes
were
state
court
injunctions
as
well
as
state
court
damage
suits.
and
so
they
created
an
additional,
they
supplemented
it
and
that
was
the
intention
that
congress,
and
the
congressmen
would
have
put
an
exception
to
norris-laguardia
in
this
bill,
but
for
that
representation
and
that
compromise.
so
what
the
respondents
are
asking
us
to
do
here
today
is
to
frustrate
the
clearly
expressed
and
agreed
intention
of
congress,
and
i'm
confident
that
the
court
will
not
do
that.
now
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
your
honor,
that
was
true
in
1947
that
you
could.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
believe
that
so
because
before
1947
you
could
always
avoid
norris-laguardia
by
filing
an
injunction
suit
in
the
state
court
and
i
think
congress
intended
to
continue
that
so
today
you
can
still
do
it.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
it
is
not
exclusive.
you
recall
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
guss
and
webber
and
dozer
and
garner
that
the
preemption
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
grew
out
of
section
10
(a)
where
congress
specifically
said
that
he
board
remedy
would
dominate
and
would
in
effect
be
exclusive.
but
here,
there
is
no
similar
provision
in
section
301,
may
is
the
word
that
congress
used.
they
intended
to
supplement
and
not
to
encroach,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
two
questions
that
were
reserved
by
this
court
in
footnote
8
of
the
dowd
box
decision,
is
a
suit
filed
in
state
court
to
enjoin
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract
now
removable,
and
due
to
restraints
of
norris-laguardia,
now
applied
to
state
courts
as
well
as
to
federal
courts.
this
petitioner
operates
a
defense
plant
at
nashville,
tennessee
and
they
make
in
that
plant
components
for
airplanes
used
by
the
defense
forces
of
the
united
states.
there
are
about
2000
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
and
these
employees
are
represented
by
the
respondents.
the
petitioner
has
a
contract
with
the
respondents,
a
three-year
contract
which
contains
a
categorical
unconditioned
no
strike
clause
effective
for
the
duration
to
the
agreement.
also
it
has
the
quid
pro
quo,
it
has
a
grievance
procedure
terminating
in
binding
arbitration.
in
the
summer
of
1965,
shortly
after
this
contract
was
executed,
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
covered
by
the
contract
including
local
union
officials
commenced
a
series
of
work
stoppages
and
interruptions
of
work
in
this
defense
plant.
the
first
stoppage
occurred
on
july
29,
1965
in
one
department
and
lasted
for
a
short
period
of
time.
thereafter,
from
time
to
time
work
stoppages
occurred
in
other
departments
of
the
plant,
one
department
after
another,
interruptions
that
bottlenecked
production
in
the
plant.
finally,
on
october
14,
1965
a
picket
line
was
placed
in
front
of
the
whole
plant,
and
the
on
the
following
morning
the
morning
of
october
15,
after
this
sort
of
interference
had
been
going
on
for
two
and
a
half
months
the
whole
plant
was
finally
shut
down
by
a
massive
picket
line.
not
until
then
did
this
petitioner
seek
injunctive
relief
and
on
october
15
they
went
into
the
chancery
court,
davidson
county,
tennessee
and
it
filed
its
bill
of
complaint
seeking
a
temporary
injunction.
the
court
granted
the
injunction,
people
went
back
to
work
and
the
respondents
did
nothing
for
another
20
days.
at
that
time
they
filed
their
petition
to
remove
this
case
to
the
district
court.
subsequently,
about
a
week
later
they
moved
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction.
of
course
we
filed
our
petition
to
remand
pointing
out
to
the
district
judge
that
we
had
filed
our
case
under
tennessee
law.
we
had
not
alleged
federal
law,
we
had
not
intended
to
invoke
federal
law,
but
tennessee
law.
nevertheless,
the
district
judge
after
considering
the
matter
for
several
months
denied
our
application
to
remand.
he
dissolved
the
state
court
order.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
temporary
injunction
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
temporary
injunction,
it
was
a
fiat
it's
called
under
tennessee
chancery
practice,
and
simply
granted
our
application
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no,
well
your
honor
there
was
an
ex
parte
hearing
solely
because
the
union
didn't
choose
to
show
up.
they
were
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
notified
by
telephone
call
although
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other,
that's
the
fact.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
they
can
whether
anyone
ever
finds
it
necessary
to
go
to
file
a
hearing,
i
don't
know.
as
your
honor
knows
from
your
own
experience,
normally
when
a
temporary
injunction
is
issued,
the
union
--
if
the
union
goes
back
to
work
and
doesn't
seek
to
litigate
it
further,
the
matter
just
hangs
there.
but
here
there's
no
case
to
test
that
because
the
removal
took
place
before
any
further
proceedings
could
occur
in
the
tennessee
state
court.
now
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no,
no
your
honor,
this
was
a
peaceful
stoppage
and
we
allege
no
violation
of
law
in
the
petition.
we
simply
allege
breach
of
contract
and
we
allege
in
the
body
of
the
petition
that
the
--
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
under
the
equity
practice
of
tennessee.
now
in
order
to
--
well
this
--
i
might
add
that
the
district
judge
told
you
his
action
and
then
the
case
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
they
affirmed
the
action
of
the
district
judge
in
their
opinion
they
stated
that
attempting
to
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
and
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
lincoln
mills,
they
said
that
in
enacting
section
301,
congress
had
preempted,
totally
preempted
the
field
of
breach
contract,
the
contract
violation
and
that
therefore
our
suit
necessarily
arose
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
cause
even
though
because
of
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia,
it
couldn't
grant
us
the
relief
that
we
sought,
and
the
only
relief
that
we
sought.
now
in
order
to
understand
this
case
and
arrive
at
a
correct
decision,
i
respectfully
submit,
we
must
first
throw
our
minds
to
the
spring
of
1947
immediately
before
congress
enacted
the
labor
management
relations
act.
and
at
that
time
it
is
undisputed
first
of
all
that
state
courts
of
equity
could
enjoin
strikes
in
breach
of
contract
that
they
were
doing
it
in
many
states.
that
congress
knew
this
and
that
such
proceedings
were
not
removable
under
1441
(b).
also
it
is
undisputed
that
at
that
time
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia
did
not
apply
to
state
courts
or
their
injunctive
orders
that's
where
we
start.
and
so
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
301
intended
to
change
any
of
that.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelming,
the
legislative
history
is
overwhelming,
that
congress
had
no
intention
to
change
any
of
those
three
things.
they
had
no
intention
to
stop
state
courts
from
enjoining
strikes
in
breach
of
contract.
they
had
no
intention
to
make
such
proceedings
removable
under
1441
(b)
or
anything
else
and
they
had
no
intention
to
extend
the
restraints
of
norris-laguardia
to
these
state
court
proceedings.
in
fact
the
intention
of
congress
was
precisely
the
contrary.
congress
intended
that
these
state
court
remedies
would
continue
to
operate
and
they
simply
supplemented
the
existing
state
court
remedies
with
one
more
remedy.
now
why
did
they
do
that?
they
did
it
because
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
in
1947,
with
seeing
these
agreements
enforced
and
they
were
concerned
by
evidence
in
legislative
hearings
that
there
were
gaps
in
the
law
of
many
states
because
of
the
diversity
problem
and
--
the
problem
are
not
diversity,
but
the
problem
of
being
unable
to
sue
unions
as
an
additive.
the
fact
that
you
had
to
sue
everybody
in
an
unincorporated
association
and
for
other
reasons
there
were
gaps
in
the
enforcement
of
these
contracts
among
the
states.
and
congress
wanted
to
assure
that
there'd
be
at
least
one
remedy
in
every
state
available
to
employers
and
the
unions
for
the
enforcement
of
these
agreements.
so
they
overlaid
an
additional
remedy,
but
they
did
not
disturb
the
existing
or
intend
to
disturb
the
existing
the
state
court
procedures
and
remedies.
now
this
is
clear
i
think
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
based
on
this
legislative
history.
this
court
for
example
held
in
dowd
and
stated
in
dowd
that
congress
manifested
its
complete
awareness
of
both
the
existence
and
the
limitations
of
state
court
remedies
for
violation
of
collective
agreements.
they
knew
all
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
states,
they
knew
they
were
enjoined.
senator
taft
himself
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
the
argument
that
“i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
law
against
courts
issuing
injunctions.”
of
course
a
court
may
always
issue
an
injunction
in
connection
with
the
lawsuit
except
as
limited
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
of
course
that
limitation
at
that
time
applied
only
to
federal
courts.
so
they
knew
about
the
injunctions.
now
what
was
their
intention?
this
court
has
stated
in
dowd
reviewing
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
not
to
limit,
but
to
expand
to
the
availability
of
forums
for
the
enforcement
of
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations.
the
court
stated
in
hughes
v.
cardinal
that
the
purpose
of
conferring
jurisdiction
under
federal
courts
was
not
to
displace
but
to
supplement
the
thoroughly
considered
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
various
states
over
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations.
and
subsequently
in
again
in
dowd,
the
court
said
in
enacting
section
301
congress
did
not
intend
to
deprive
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
right
to
seek
redress
of
its
violation
in
an
appropriate
state
tribunal.
they
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
take
away
any
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts,
did
not
intend
to
encroach
in
any
way
on
the
state
courts.
this
is
the
finding
of
this
court
and
it's
based
on
undisputed
legislative
history.
so
we
must
conclude
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
leave
the
existing
state
remedies
in
effect.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i'm
coming
to
that
point
and
i'll
be
there
right
now,
your
honor.
congress
did
enact
section
301
and
it
said
that
suits
for
violation
of
labor
context
may,
maybe
filed
in
federal
courts.
and
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
decisions
that
by
this
language,
congress
did
intend
to
create
a
substantive
body
of
law
to
be
enforced
as
a
federal
right
and
not
simply
a
creation
of
a
forum
to
enforce
state
law.
there's
no
question
about
that
your
honor,
but
--
and
this
court
has
further
held
that
in
fashioning
the
law
to
be
applied
in
federal
court
or
under
301
procedures,
this
court
will
fashion
a
law
and
you
will
adopt
law
that
is
not
incompatible,
state
court
rules
that
are
not
incompatible
with
national
policy.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
but
i'm
reaching
that
point
and
this
is
my
next
point.
congress
did
create
this
law,
it
did
empower
you
to
fashion
a
substantive
law
and
you
have
done
it.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
but
it
did
not
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
if
it's
brought
in
a
state
court
under
301,
but
what
if
the
petitioner
doesn't
elect
to
bring
his
action
into
state
court
under
301?
he
can
because
federal
law
can
be
enforced
in
state
courts.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
apply
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes
your
honor,
i've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
have
brought
--
well
i
won't
say
many
times
but
you
can,.
i've
seen
litigants
do
it,
but
we
didn't.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
i
don't
think
you'd
be
very
well
advised
to
do
it
in
view
of
the
suggestion
now
that
that
automatically
makes
it
removable.
but
my
--
position
is
that
our
two
coexisting
of
systems
of
law
for
enforcing
of
contract
now
because
otherwise
all
of
this
language
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
deprive
--
didn't
even
intend
to
deprive
a
party
of
their
right
to
seek
redress
for
its
violation
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
i
don't
i
think
it
necessarily
is.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes
sir,
this
is
an
additional
string
to
our
bow.
and
i
know
--
and
i
want
to
make
this
point,
because
this
is
not
been
considered
by
this
court
to
my
knowledge
heretofore
and
i
think
that
it
is
basic
in
reviewing
what
congress
intended
and
what
happened
here?
in
pan
american
petroleum
decided
several
years
ago
by
this
court,
it
was
held
of
course,
but
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
federal
remedy
created
by
congress,
but
the
plaintiff
elected
to
bring
his
pursuit
under
state
law.
and
of
course
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
in
the
state
court
and
saying
the
state,
that
matter
had
been
preempted,
the
federal
remedy
was
exclusive.
and
this
court
there
held
that
a
plaintiff
is
master
of
his
suit,
you
will
look
solely
to
the
language
of
the
petition
to
see
whether
he
elected
to
come
under
federal
law
or
a
state
law
that
there
the
petitioner,
even
though
there
was
a
federal
remedy
and
it
was
arguably
exclusive,
had
elected
to
come
under
state
law
by
his
petition
and
that
the
question
of
removability
doesn't
turn
on
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case
or
whether
the
plaintiff
was
right.
the
court
said
that
where
the
plaintiff
has
pitched
here
suit
under
state
law,
it
is
not
removable
because
he
has
not
alleged
something
that
arose
under
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
think
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
only
if
we
had
elected
to
file
that
suit
--
oh
but
that's
just
your
honor,
this
is
what
pan
american
says
and
what
(inaudible)
says
and
other
cases,
only
if
we
had
elected
and
stated
in
our
petition
that
we
were
bringing
the
suit
under
federal
law,
would
that
damage
suit
had
been
removable?
now
that
is
unnecessary
to
a
decision
of
this
case,
but
it
does
elucidate
the
theory
that
i
am
presenting
to
you
here.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
your
honor
my
point
is
that
federal
law
does
not
apply
here
because
we
brought
a
suit
under
state
law.
and
state
law
has
not
been
preempted
by
--
totally
preempted
by
301.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor,
not
the
choice
of
forum,
but
the
allegations
of
the
petition
and
that's
what
this
court
said
(inaudible)
it's
what
you
said
in
pan
american
petroleum
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
he
can
determine
what
law
he
wants
to
bring
his
suit
in.
we
determined
that
we
want
to
bring
ours
under
tennessee
law
and
nobody
--
and
the
tennessee
chancellor
impliedly
found
there
was
a
tennessee
law
still
because
he
granted
us
our
relief,
and
nobody
took
an
appeal
from
his
decision.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor,
but
up
to
now
the
court
has
determined
the
contrary.
the
court
has
determined
in
lucas
and
dowd
and
hughes
v.
cardinal
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
preempt
only
pro
tanto,
only
to
the
extent
that
local
rules
are
inconsistent
with
the
overriding
national
policy
as
set
forth
in
this
law.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
the
general
question
of
whether
a
state
court
suit
could
be
removable
was
reserved
and
this
is
a
facet
of
that
question,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
and
the
applicability
of
norris-laguardia,
yes
sir.
now
we
contend
that
if
the
lucas
and
dowd
and
hughes
v.
cardinal
mean
what
they
say,
and
incidentally
in
hughes
v.
cardinal
by
substantive
this
court
made
a
definition
and
the
definition
was
that
something
is
substantive
within
this
preemptive
concept
only
if
it
affects
the
formation
of
a
contract
with
a
private
settlement
of
disputes
under
that
contract.
anything
outside
that
area
is
not
preempted
that's
why
i
read
these
decisions.
now,
here
a
contract
had
been
formed
so
tennessee
law
didn't
affect
in
any
way
the
formation
of
the
contract,
and
the
private
settlement
of
disputes
as
set
up
in
that
contract
had
broken
down
just
as
they
had
in
hughes
v.
cardinal,
because
we're
in
court,
they
are
obviously
broken
down.
now
the
minute
we
get
into
that
area
of
remedy,
this
is
an
area
that
is
not
been
preempted
and
therefore
the
state
remedy
would
remain
in
effect
just
as
the
state
statute
of
limitations
was
recognized
as
effective
in
dowd.
now
it's
true
that
in
dowd,
the
suit
was
initiated
in
the
--
i
mean
in
hughes
v.
cardinal,
the
suit
was
initiated
in
the
federal
court
so
you
had
no
removal
problem
there
and
naturally
if
the
suit
is
brought
in
federal
court
it
can
only
be
brought
under
301
only
under
federal
law.
you
have
indicated
your
election
by
filing
this
suit
in
federal
court.
now
there's
one
more
point
here.
as
your
honors
have
suggested,
even
if
you
do
--
you
think
that
no
state
law
now
exists,
surely
we
were
entitled
to
allege
the
contrary.
we
didn't
attempt
or
purport
to
allege
a
federal
suit,
and
so
it
wouldn't
be
removable
if
we
were
wrong
and
alleged
only
a
state
cause
of
action.
that
wouldn't
make
it
removable.
we
can't
be
compelled
to
seek
a
federal
remedy
if
we
don't
want
one.
now,
however
even
if
federal
law,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
even
if
federal
law
is
considered
as
preempting
the
whole
substantive
field,
it
still
would
not
be
removable
because
even
if
the
tennessee
court
was
being
asked
by
us,
as
it
wasn't
to
apply
federal
law,
this
was
not
a
law
arising
under
laws
of
the
united
states
because
it
was
fashioned
law,
fashioned
by
the
federal
courts
and
adapted
from
the
states
and
so
it
was
created
by
the
states
and
not
the
courts
and
not
congress
and
it
would
not
arise
under
federal
in
any
event.
that
is
our
contention
as
set
forth
in
great
detail
in
our
brief.
now,
there's
a
second
facet
to
this
and
i
just
want
to
allude
to
this
briefly.
in
sinclair
this
court
has
held
that
congress
in
enacting
301
simply
intended
to
leave
norris-laguardia
the
way
it
was.
and
it
didn't
intend
to
make
any
exemptions
to
it,
just
continue
it.
well,
the
way
it
was,
it
didn't
apply
to
state
court
injunction
proceedings,
and
we
contend
therefore
that
a
federal
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
original
jurisdiction
over
a
suit
to
enjoin
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract.
norris-laguardia
of
course
was
enacted
back
in
1932
before
the
merger
of
law
in
equity
in
federal
courts.
at
that
time
we
had
an
equity
side
and
a
law
side,
and
these
injunction
suits
had
to
be
brought
under
the
equity
side.
so
congress
was
concerned
obviously
only
with
withdrawing
jurisdiction
from
the
equity
side
of
the
court
and
any
reference
to
equity
in
the
legislative
history
arose
from
this
circumstance.
but
congress
did
use
the
big
word
jurisdiction
because
as
this
court
said
in
sinclair
they
wanted
to
use
the
biggest
possible
language
in
order
to
block
any
possibility
of
misconstruction
or
a
narrowing
construction
by
the
courts.
they
wanted
to
take
jurisdiction
away
from
federal
courts
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
we
say
they
did,
and
take
the
jurisdiction
away
and
if
that
is
true,
then
such
a
suit
would
not
be
removable
under
1441
(b).
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
we
did
not,
your
honor,
allege
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites
to
an
injunction
suit
under
federal
law
which
would
have
been
that
unlawful
acts
were
threatened
or
had
been
committed,
and
secondly
that
public
officers
charged
with
the
protection
of
property
could
not
or
would
not
protect.
this
is
no
--
neither
of
these
and
these
allegations
to
our
mind
are
like
a
$10,000.00
allegation
where
a
$10,000.00
minimum
is
required
for
federal
jurisdiction.
unless
you
allege
these
things,
you
have
not
stated,
you
have
not
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court
under
norris-laguardia,
and
we
didn't
allege
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
both
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
in
the
body
of
our
petition,
we
allege
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i'm
not
referring
to
the
prayer,
i'm
referring
of
our
petition,
i'm
referring
to
the
body
where
we
set
forth
the
facts
that
entitled
us
to
relief
under
tennessee
law.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor
because
we,
as
i've
indicated
sought
to
invoke
only
tennessee
law,
not
federal
law,
and
unless
you
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
you
can
not
have
federal
relief.
you
can
not
state
a
federal
cause
of
action
unless
you
elect
to
do
that,
and
we
didn't
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
well
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
that
if
we
allege
the
facts
necessary
to
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
had
it
elected
by
the
language
of
our
petition
to
rely
on
the
federal
cause
of
action
then
the
fact
that
we
didn't
pray
for
injunctive
relief
would
not
mean
that
it
wasn't
the
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
no
your
honor.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
decision
of
the
case,
because
in
sinclair
all
as
i
understand
--
i
consider
sinclair
an
authority
for
us
and
not
against
us
because
in
sinclair
you
specifically
stated
--
it
was
a
agreed
by
the
conferees
that
no
change
in
the
existing
and
the
injunction
provisions
of
norris-laguardia
should
be
made.
as
i
pointed
out
the
existing
restraints
applied
only
to
federal
courts,
we're
in
the
state
court.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
central
airlines
relied
on
with
the
respondents
turned
solely
on
the
intention
of
congress,
and
this
court
held
that
congress
intended
there
to
establish
an
exclusive
remedy,
but
here
congress
didn't.
and
let
me
draw
your
attention
very
briefly
to
the
legislative
history
once
again.
in
1947,
the
house
passed
a
bill
that
provided
for
enforcement
in
federal
district
courts
of
suits
for
violation
of
labor
contracts,
and
also
contained
a
specific
exception
to
norris-laguardia
to
cover
those
suits
in
federal
suits
and
that
was
the
bill
as
it
passed
the
house.
in
the
senate,
they
also
provided
for
injunctive
relief
on
the
original
bill.
they
provided
a
suit
in
federal
courts
and
they
also
provided
a
--
that
there
would
be
a
--
to
become
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
would
bring
it
under
section
10
(j)
of
the
act.
so
both
bills
originally
had
facility
to
enjoin
a
strike
against
breach
of
contract.
they'd
said
it
to
the
committee
and
the
committee
came
up
with
a
compromise
and
they
decided
to
drop
the
exception
to
norris-laguardia
out
of
the
house
bill,
and
to
drop
the
unfair
labor
practice
out
of
the
said
bill
on
the
representation
that
they
were
going
to
leave
the
enforcement
of
these
contracts
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.
now
those
usual
processes
were
state
court
injunctions
as
well
as
state
court
damage
suits.
and
so
they
created
an
additional,
they
supplemented
it
and
that
was
the
intention
that
congress,
and
the
congressmen
would
have
put
an
exception
to
norris-laguardia
in
this
bill,
but
for
that
representation
and
that
compromise.
so
what
the
respondents
are
asking
us
to
do
here
today
is
to
frustrate
the
clearly
expressed
and
agreed
intention
of
congress,
and
i'm
confident
that
the
court
will
not
do
that.
now
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
yes,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
your
honor,
that
was
true
in
1947
that
you
could.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
--
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
believe
that
so
because
before
1947
you
could
always
avoid
norris-laguardia
by
filing
an
injunction
suit
in
the
state
court
and
i
think
congress
intended
to
continue
that
so
today
you
can
still
do
it.
mr.
j.
mack
swigert
it
is
not
exclusive.
you
recall
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
guss
and
webber
and
dozer
and
garner
that
the
preemption
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
grew
out
of
section
10
(a)
where
congress
specifically
said
that
he
board
remedy
would
dominate
and
would
in
effect
be
exclusive.
but
here,
there
is
no
similar
provision
in
section
301,
may
is
the
word
that
congress
used.
they
intended
to
supplement
and
not
to
encroach,
that
is
our
position.
