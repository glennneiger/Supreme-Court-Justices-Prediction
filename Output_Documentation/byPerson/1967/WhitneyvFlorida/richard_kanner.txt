mr.
richard
kanner
--
whether
it
is
feasible
for
this
court
to
accept
standard
by
which
the
effectiveness
and
duty
of
a
court
appointed
trial
counsel
can
be
measured.
secondly
whether
a
court
appointed
trial
counsel
has
a
duty
to
abide
by
his
client's
instructions
during
the
pretrial
proceedings
of
the
case.
and
lastly
whether
when
this
court
held
it
was
inherently
invalid
to
hold
a
murder
trial
in
a
community
exposed
to
the
defendants
televised
confessions,
did
this
court
mean
inherently
invalid
or
mean
inherently
invalid
sometimes.
i
feel
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
decisive
to
all
of
the
issues
which
i
am
attempting
to
raise
and
i
will
discuss
them
at
some
length.
i
expect
also
to
discuss
the
need
for
an
adequate
standard
to
measure
the
effectiveness
and
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel.
i
also
expect
to
discuss
some
suggested
standards
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
american
bar
association's
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
and
lastly
of
course
to
discuss
the
existing
precedent
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
as
to
the
facts,
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
was
17
years
old,
he
is
white,
of
average
to
above
average
in
intelligence.
he
has
a
tenth
grade
education.
he
and
his
family
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
resided
in
california,
so
that
when
he
was
apprehended
near
west
palm
beach,
he
was
out
without
of
either
a
counsel
or
family.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
i
expect
to
discuss
that
on
to
the
topic
of
the
test
in
determining
the
adequacy
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
feel
that
the
failure
to
present
such
testimony
your
honor
is
one
of
the
indications
to
show
that
trial
counsel
completely
abandoned
all
defenses
that
were
applicable
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
mr.
justice.
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
immediately
confessed
to
an
additional
seven
homicides
all
committed
in
the
perpetration
of
robbery.
all
of
these
homicides
were
committed
within
the
period
of
30
days;
one
in
california,
three
i
believe
in
arizona
and
four
in
florida.
the
four
that
were
in
committed
in
south
florida
were
all
committed
within
that
past
week.
the
defendant
as
i
say
was
apprehended
in
west
palm
beach
and
immediately
the
next
day
on
march
6th
of
1960
he
was
taken
to
miami
where
he
again
repeated
these
confessions
to
these
eight
separate
homicides,
this
time
your
honors
in
the
presence
of
television
cameras,
radio
microphones
and
of
course
the
news
media.
the
defendant
was
returned
to
west
palm
beach
in
may
where
he
was
convicted
and
given
a
recommendation
of
mercy
which
in
florida
is
automatically
means
life.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
so
far
as
the
rule
one,
the
post
collateral
attack
petition
is
concerned
your
honor,
we'll
strike
that.
it
does
not
say
live
or
taped.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
i
have
only
examined
the
record
i
don't
know,
other
than
what
the
rule
1
--
what
i've
alleged
in
the
rule
1
petition.
the
defendant
was
returned
to
miami
in
may
and
counsel
were
appointed
for
him.
counsel
made
a
motion
for
the
appointment
of
the
psychiatrist
to
determine
his
competency.
two
were
appointed
and
three
examined
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
found
competent
by
all
of
the
three
psychiatrists
and
competent
to
stand
trial
and
know
right
from
wrong.
their
opinions
ran
the
range
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
mere
personality
disorder
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
severe
psychosis,
that
is
almost
out
of
touch
with
reality,
although
still
able
to
know
right
from
wrong.
the
psychiatrist
who
had
not
been
formally
appointed
two
weeks
before
his
trial
filed
his
report
and
this
psychiatrist
said
i
can
state
unequivocally
that
without
further
advances
in
the
psychiatric
field
this
boy
will
a
menace
to
society
as
long
as
he
may
live.
counsel
were
asked
by
the
petitioner
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
but
they
failed
to
do
so.
so
to
please
the
court
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
defendant
went
on
trial
for
his
life
in
june.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
they
were
court
appointed
counsel
your
honor.
after
the
selection,
after
the
voir
dire
and
the
selection
of
the
jury
the
defendant
freely
and
voluntarily
and
on
the
advise
of
his
counsel
and
on
the
advise
of
his
two
sisters
and
his
brother
who
had
come
from
california
to
the
trial
signed
what
was
denominated
as
a
“stipulation”
which
in
effect
was
a
plea
of
guilty
because
it
admitted
facts,
all
of
the
necessary
facts
necessary
to
constitute
murder
in
the
first
degree
of
this
person
in
question.
the
defendant
was
not
taken
before
the
trial
court
prior
to
the
introduction
of
the
stipulation
into
evidence.
so
the
trial
was
limited
as
it
was
to
the
judicial
stipulation.
there
were
some
corroborating
physical
evidence,
corroborating
the
confession
of
stipulation
and
also
the
defendant's
own
testimony
as
to
his
earlier
environment.
there
was
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
the
stipulation
was
in
fact
a
confession.
it
said
that,
it's
on
page
40
of
the
--
39
of
the
record.
it
says
that
the
defendant
did
go
into
this
gas
station.
mr.
richard
kanner
this
was
not
set
out
in
the
stipulation
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
was
also
introduced
your
honor,
you
are
correct.
mr.
richard
kanner
a
recording
of
his
confessions
which
he
made
in
palm
beach,
strike
that.
a
recording
of
the
confessions
as
to
this
particular
crime
which
he
made
in
palm
beach
was
introduced,
that
is
in
palm
beach
he
made
this
confessions
to
all
of
these
crimes
on
a,
gray
audograph
disk,
that
portion
of
his
confessions
on
the
gray
audograph
disk
applicable
to
this
particular
murder
was
played
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
why
it
was
played
to
the
jury.
there
is
testimony
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition
proceeding
which
is
in
the
record
before
this
court
that
the
--
the
stipulation
was
entered
on
a
quid
pro
quo
basis,
that
is
that
the
state
would
certain
things
and
limit
their
evidence
providing
the
stipulation
was
signed.
there
is
actually
nothing
in
the
stipulation
itself
or
any
copies
of
the
stipulation
as
to
exactly
what
the
consideration
was
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
stipulation
mr.
justice
as
to
whether
any
promises
were
made
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
argument
that
the
state
advanced
at
the
habeas
corpus
petition
which
was
accepted
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
certiorari
was
denied.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice,
as
to
whether
those
witnesses
would
be
relevant
in
florida
if
not
before
this
court.
so
as
i
say
the
trial
was
limited
to
the
stipulation.
there
was
the
gray
audograph
disk
and
some
corroborating
testimony
in
the
defendant's
trial.
there
was
no
mitigating
testimony
at
all
from
the
psychiatrist,
nor
was
there
the
first
instruction
for
the
jury.
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
a
stipulation
and
it
leaves
to
you
the
sole
question
of
mercy
you
are
to
disregard
any
publicity
that
you
may
have
learned
about
the
defendant
and
you
are
to
base
the
decision
on
mercy
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
that
was
not
the
first
instruction,
not
the
first
word
from
this
court,
that
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned,
that
the
jury
had
to
limit
its
deliberations
to
the
facts,
to
the
evidence
presented
at
this
trial.
the
jury
did
return
a
verdict
without
a
recommendation
of
mercy.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
however
by
i
what
i've
said
heretofore
that
counsel
or
proforma
in
their
representation
of
this
boy
so
far
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned
because
they
were
not,
counsel
moved
for
such
discovery
as
available
in
florida
and
they
also
moved
to
some
discovery
that
was
not
available
in
florida
such
as
his
testimony
at
the
palm
beach
trial.
they
also
moved
for
a
list
of
witnesses
and
the
bill
of
particulars
and
they
asked
to
hire
ballistics
and
fingerprint
experts.
so
as
far
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
concerned
i
don't
wish
to
leave
any
implication
to
the
court
that
trial
counsel,
defense
versus
proforma
because
so
far
as
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned
up
to
the
assigning
of
the
stipulation
it
was
not
proforma
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
counsel's
recommendation
mr.
justice
marshall
assigned
the
stipulation.
my
quarrel
with
counsel
is
that
having
entered
into
the
stipulation,
they
completely
abandoned
this
boy.
they
made
no
attempt,
no
effort
to
insulate
him
from
the
affects
of
this
publicity.
the
appeal
again
ignored
the
publicity.
it
was
limited
to
the
inability
of
trial
counsel
to
challenge
members
of
the
grand
jury,
the
prejudicial
final
argument
and
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
found
the
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
is
a
former
assistant
municipal
judge
for
the
city
of
miami.
at
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
nothing
in
this
record
and
nothing
in
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
was
not
even
living
in
miami
at
the
time.
the
counsel
from
his
earlier
case
in
west
palm
beach,
then
entered
the
case
and
filed
an
original
petition
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
alleging
that
the
judicial
stipulation
was
entered
into
on
the
express
agreement
or
guarantee
of
this
trial
counsel
that
the
defendant's
life
would
be
spared
with
the
signing
of
this
stipulation.
the
florida
supreme
court
appointed
a
commissioner
who
heard
extensive
hearings
and
he
--
the
commissioner
recommended
to
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
facts
were
not
as
proven.
mr.
richard
kanner
the
jury,
your
honor,
with
a
recommendation
of
mercy
that
is
the
seven
of
the
12
jurors
in
florida
must
recommend
mercy
and
it's
mandatory
in
florida.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
this
was
the
argument
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
petition.
it
was
denied
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
this
court
has
denied
certiorari.
i
don't
expect
to
get
into
it,
but
i
only
bring
this
up
is
to
show
the
present
posture
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
black
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
that
is
correct.
the
petitioner
that
in
proper
person
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
jacksonville
a
habeas
corpus
petition
alleging
for
the
first
time
that
the
listing
had
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
the
united
states
district
judge
denied
the
petition
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
court
had
not
been
given
the
opportunity
as
yet
to
rule
on
that
matter.
after
which
the
petitioner
filed
his
pro
se
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
concurred
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
judge,
stayed
his
execution,
where
upon
the
petitioner
with
counsel
filed
his
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
the
florida
circuit
court,
the
trial
court.
our
post
conviction
of
collateral
attack
statute,
our
rule
is
identical
with
the
federal
2255
proceeding.
the
rule
1
petition
made
no
allegation,
though
that
his
trial
was
unfair
so
far
as
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned.
defendant
has
always
conceded
his
guilt,
but
as
rule
1
petition
laid
down
in
length
what
that
it
was
that
his
trial
so
far
as
guilt
or,
so
far
mercy
was
concerned
was
unclear.
and
this
mr.
justice
fortas
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
suggest
that
his
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
was
unfair
because
of
the
failure
to
defense
counsel
to
call
the
expert
mitigating
witnesses.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
your
honor
in
florida
it
is
normally
one
proceeding.
when
the
advent
of
the
judicial
stipulation
or
confession,
the
only
issue
mr.
justice
before
the
jury
was
the
question
of
mercy.
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
no
longer
a
part
of
the
determination
by
the
jury
because
the
facts
have
been
stipulated.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
that
is
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
reason
for
them
to
introduce
one
witness
who
establish
venue
but
they
did.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
only
saying
your
honor
that
so
far
as
the
rule
1
petition
was
concerned,
it
conceded
his
guilt,
but
it
is
alleged
that
the
publicity
inter
alia
was
a
factor
which
precluded
him
from
receiving
a
fair
trail
on
the
question
of
mercy.
mr.
richard
kanner
now,
the
trial
judge
in
an
ex
parte
order
required
the
state
to
file
a
reply
which
they
did.
the
state
denied
all
of
the
allegations
in
the
rule
1
proceeding
and
further
by
way
of
affirmative
defense,
the
state
said
that
the
habeas
corpus
ruling
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
direct
appeal
were
res
judicata
as
to
all
of
the
issues
which
were
raised
in
the
collateral
attack.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black
in
florida
mercy
is
within
the
sole
discretion
of
the
jury
and
whatever
evidence
the
defendant
may
wish
to
offer
in
that
regard
can't
be
received.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
don't
understand
that.
mr.
richard
kanner
on
the
sentence
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
on
the
sentence,
not
on
the
conviction
but
on
the
sentence.
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
but
i
don't
say
that
it's
unfair
if
you
were
to
take
--
isolate
this
one
instance.
i
say
that
it
is
unfair
when
viewed
in
the
background
of
the
publicity
and
when
viewed
in
the
background
of
failing
to
have
the
court
give
instructions
to
attempt
to
insulate
the
defendant
from
the
publicity.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
saying
it
was
unconstitutional
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
his
counsel,
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
rule
1
petition
which
have
to
be
taken
at
this
point
as
being
true,
is
that
his
counsel
refused
to
put
on
the
expert
psychiatric
witnesses
without
cause
or
justification.
i
think
this
is
the
issue
that
this
case
boils
down
to
mr.
justice,
is
whether
these
acts
of
counsel
are
going
to
be
imputed
to
the
client
and
i
believe
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
brennan
if
this
court
holds
that
the
standard
of
trial
advocacy
in
this
case
fell
so
far
below
that
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
prescribes,
then
he
is
going
to
get
a
new
trial
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
only
because
in
florida
we
have
no
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor,
as
to
whether
his
stipulation
would
still
be
admissible
into
evidence
that
i
don't
know.
so
is
the
--
the
trial
judge
denied
the
rule
1
proceedings
on
the
grounds
of
res
judicata
that
was
replied
to
by
the
state
after
which
an
appeal
was
taken
to
our
intermediate
florida
court.
now
our
florida
intermediate
court
recognized
sanders
versus
united
states
and
said
that
res
judicata
was
absolutely
not
applicable
on
the
rule,
on
the
collateral
attack
proceedings.
but
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
did
say
that
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
exhaust
his
peremptory
challenge
and
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
and
then
in
reliance
on
the
sixth
circuit's
shepherd
lee
maxwell
case
precluded
raising
the
publicity
issue
in
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
no
appellate
court
has
the
power
to
tell
a
trial
court
or
to
tell
the
trial
court
jury
that
it
should
recommend
mercy.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
my
research
has
not
found
a
case
on
this
point
pro
or
con.
i
think
that
i
may
have
--
i
have
confused
the
court
by
conceding
the
guilt
of
this
defendant
and
only
subjecting
my
argument
to
the
question
of
mercy.
there's
a
practical
and
there's
an
actual
matter
as
you
understand
mr.
justice
that
is
what
i
am
complaining
about.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
this
mr.
justice
that
if
this
court
feels
that
it
is
possible
to
establish
guidelines,
to
test
one
the
effectiveness
and
two
the
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
and
then
finds
that
such
guidelines
or
standards
were
violated
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
were
concerned
then
i
feel
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
reverse
it.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
know
whether
the
judicial
confession
would
be
admissible
or
not.
he
had
his
counsel
there.
he
had
his
sisters
there.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
would
presume
on
the
random
that
it
would
not
be.
so
as
i
say
i
expect
to
discuss
one;
the
need
for
adequate
standards
to
measure
the
duty
and
effectiveness
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
and
secondly
some
suggested
standards
and
lastly
the
applicable
precedent.
mr.
justice
has
asked
for
the
need.
35
years
ago
in
carl
versus
alabama
this
court
laid
down
the
mandate
that
counsel
should
render
effective
and
substantial
aid.
up
until
this
case,
i
don't
believe
the
question
as
to
what
effective
and
substantial
aid
has
come
up.
it
came
up
to
the
slight
extent
in
avery
versus
alabama
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
not
violated.
this
court
did
in
it's
supervisory
power
over
the
federal
courts
in
alaska
versus
united
states
hold
that
when
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
co-counsel
that
there
was
not
aid,
the
counsel
was
not
“as
effective
as
it
might
have
been.”
now
your
honors
with
the
advent
of
gideon
v.
wainwright
and
the
proliferation
of
court
appointed
counsel
throughout
the
state
systems,
i
feel
that
there
is
now
a
need
for
some
adequate
guidelines
to
test
what
is
duty
and
what
is
the
criteria
for
effective
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
is
this
your
honor,
they
did
not
question
the
court
to
give
any
instructions
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
was
required
to
limit
the
deliberations
on
mercy
to
the
record
in
this
case.
secondly
i
feel
that
trial
counsel
went
below
what
is
normal
or
fair
representation
when
they
did
not
put
on
the
mitigating
circumstances.
thirdly
i
think
counsel
was
derelict
regardless
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
the
three
psychiatrists
who
examined
this
boy,
all
agreed
that
he
was
very
sick,
that
he
wanted
be
helped
and
that
his
mental
illness,
at
least
one
of
them
said
that
it
boarded
on
a
psychosis
that
is
that
he
was
--
had
lost
touch
of
reality.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honor
i
am
complaining
that
the
court--
mr.
richard
kanner
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
kanner
he
would
have
charged
–
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
there
is
no
law
on
that,
except
that
the
law
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
the
law
in
florida
which
i
believe
would
necessitate
a
charge
is
that
in
florida
and
we
have
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
so
holding,
that
the
trial
on
the
question
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
that's
correct.
an
analogous
example,
shepherd
v.
maxwell
this
court
held
that
often
trial
judge
has
an
obligation
sua
sponte
to
make
such
effective
controls
as
maybe
necessary
to
ensure
a
fair
trial
and
i
feel
certainly
insofar
as
instructions
on
the
question
of
mercy
were
concerned
mr.
justice
black
that
there
was
an
obligation
one
on
trial
counsel
and
two
failure
of
trial
counsel
i
feel
there
was
an
obligation
sua
sponte
for
the
court.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
prepared
the
petition
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
those
are
exactly
the
questions
which
i
want
this
court
to
answer
mr.
justice.
my
argue
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
my
stating
the
questions
here
in
oral
argument
is
only
to
show
that
there
wasn't
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
and
i
only
say
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
because
of
these
factors
which
i
have
alleged
in
my
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
marshall
we
have
--
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
so
we
have
nothing
but
the
rule
1
allegation
which
says
the
defendant
requesting
his
court
appointed
counsel
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
but
they
did
not
do
so.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice,
if
i
were
to
redraft
the
petition
and
presuming
that
i
thought
that
i
could
prove
it.
i'm
certain
that
i
would
specify
time,
place
and
date
and
the
exact
language
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
in
these
circumstances
with
the
background
of
the
televised
confessions
i
feel
that
in
these
circumstances
mr.
justice
that
it
was.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not.
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
and
my
argument
is
to
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
is
only
to
show
in
these
circumstances
that
the
record
conclusively
shows
that
a
post
conviction
evidentiary
hearing
was
required.
counsel
for
the
state
has
conceded
that
there's
no
question
of
waiver
or
adequate
independent
state
grounds
to
support
the
appellate
court.
if
the
record
is
the
statement,
would
have
the
court
believe
showed
positively
that
the
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
were
a
fair
one,
then
there
would
be
no
due
process
question.
my
argument
mr.
justices
is
that
the
state
contends
one
that
the
voir
dire
conclusively
shows
that
the
trial
on
mercy
was
fair.
i
say
mr.
justices
that
the
voir
dire
or
no
voir
dire,
the
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
was
not
fair
for
reasons
one,
two
and
three
and
that
we
either
need
to
have
this
case
reversed,
if
this
court
is
going
to
have
minimum
trial
standards
or
two
if
the
court
rules
that
it
is
a
duty
then
this
court
has
--
the
case
has
to
be
reversed
for
only
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
this
is
one
of
the
remedies
that
this
court
can
do,
if
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
sir,
unless
this
court
propitiously
on
it's
own
feels
that
such
error
is
--
such
unfairness
is
substantiated
in
the
record
and
the
reason
i
put
it
this
way,
is
that
this
case
is
not
quite
rideau
v.
louisiana,
because
the
only
thing
that
shows
actual
i
think
if
there
was
positive
testimony
of
18
people
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
that
they
had
seen
televised
confessions
of
the
defendant.
i
think
this
court
on
it's
own
could
reverse
this
case,
but
so
far
as
the
actual
publication
of
these
televised
confessions
were
concerned,
it's
--
i
only
gathered
from
the
questions
on
the
voir
dire
from
the
state
attorney
and
that's
primarily
and
the
--
there's
no
question
about
what
the
televised
confessions
were
taped
as
positive
testimony
is
to
that,
but
so
far
their
publication
i
only
gathered
this
from
the
voir
dire
questions
for
the
state
attorney.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
because
your
honor
in
reliance
on
sixth
circuit
sheppard
versus
maxwell
there
was
no
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
though
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
excellent
what
the
law
is
in
florida
now
this
is
a
case
that
we're
appealing
from
--
mr.
richard
kanner
because
there
this
is
a
limitation
on
florida's
--
in
effect
of
limitations
on
florida's
collateral
remedy.
this
is
--
fay
v.
noia
was
a
federal
case,
not
a
state
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
with
fay
versus
noia
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
say
i
am
familiar
your
honor
with
fay
versus
noia.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
well,
it's
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
--
mr.
richard
kanner
whether
i'm
properly
this
court
or
not.
i
feel
that
if
there
is
such
thing
as
standards
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
which
point
mr.
justice?
mr.
richard
kanner
well
they
had
conceded
that
there
is
no
adequate
statement.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
i
--
the
reason
that
i
my
oral
argument
is
taken
the
tact
that
it
has
is
because
the
state
says
that
he
received
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
question
of
waiver.
on
page
21
of
the
state's
brief,
the
state
says,
if
i
can
quote
that
in
a
second,
the
state
does
not
regard
of
the
factual
situation
in
the
instant
matter
as
being
a
waiver
of
petitioner's
rights.
it
is
state's
position
because
the
jury
was
in
fact
fair
and
impartial
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
were
preserved
by
his
counsel
and
consequently
there
was
no
waiver.
but
in
view
of
this
concession
i
think
that
--
so
far
as
argument
is
concerned
that
i
have
to
come
forward
to
show
that
the
constitutional
rights
were
not
preserved
because
of
items
one,
two
and
three.
the
present
test
to
determine
the
adequacy
of
court
appointed
counsel
was
whether
such
trial
resulted
in
a
farce.
and
i
hardly
feel
that
this
standard
approaches
anywhere
close
to
the
level
of,
this
court
laid
down
last
term
in
anders
versus
california
where
appellate
counsel,
that
is
a
counsel
must
be
an
active
advocate.
the
--
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
just
numerous
recent
law
review
articles.
there
is
numerous
recent
editorials
and
articles
in
the
american
bar
general
and
of
course
the
american
bar
association's
project
to
establish
minimum
standards
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
all
of
these
articles
to
attempt
to
show
that
there
is
some
need
to
establish
minimum
standards
and
if
there
are
any
type
of
minimum
standards
whatsoever
then
such
minimum
standards
were
violated
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
as
to
regardless
or
irregardless
of
any
request
or
suggestion
or
demand
by
client
i
think
there
was
a
failure
to
move
or
change
of
venue
or
at
least
they
continue
was
one,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
second
was
failure
to
exempt
the
litigating
expert
testimony
from
the
psychiatrist
and
lastly
was
to
request
an
instruction
from
the
court
to
the
jury
and
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
that
this
jury
had
to
disregard
all
of
the
attendant
publicity
of
that
--
these
other
six
or
seven
murders
and
limit
its
discussion
on
the
question
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
of
course
it
is
and
there
was
an
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
the
jury
shall
make
its
determination
of
facts
on
this,
on
this
record,
or
this
evidence
or
was
one
cause
of
the
sentence.
so
far
as
the
question
of
fact
was
concerned
that
the
jury
should
confine
itself
to
the
evidence,
but
of
course
there
were
no
facts
to
decide.
now
as
to
the
applicability
of
existing
precedent
the
state
has
as
i've
read
has
conceded
that
there
was
no
waiver.
they
have
–
and
the
state
of
florida
now
recognizes
that
res
judicata
is
not
actually
applicable
in
matters
which
let's
say
are
actually
raised.
the
state
has
made
no
explanation
as
to
why
there
was
no
instruction
relative
to
publicity
immensely
or
why
that
there
was
no
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
or
instruction.
mr.
richard
kanner
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black
the
whole
record
trial
and
habeas
corpus
is
replete
with
comments
about
taking
this
boy's
picture
in
front
of
the
television.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
in
rideau
versus
louisiana
and
more
probably
more
particularly
pointed
in
marshall
versus
united
states.
marshall
v.
united
states
was
a
case
where
trial
was
in
progress
and
they
sequestered
or
they
broke
through
the
night
recessed
and
there
was
evidence
in
marshall
prior
records
or
convictions
of
the
defendant
which
would
not
be
admissible
and
the
trial
judge
in
marshall
took
each
of
the
jurors
into
his
chambers
and
asked
them
will
you
disregard
this.
and
each
of
the
juror
said
certainly
we
will
and
we
will
base
our
record
on
the
evidence,
base
our
verdict
on
the
evidence.
this
court
nevertheless
reversed.
i
feel
that
the
reasoning
in
irvin
versus
dowd,
mr.
justice
black
is
that
sometimes
when
things
can
be
so
bad
that
regardless
of
presence
or
absence
of
what
a
juror
says
that
the
case
has
to
be
reversed.
we've
got
rideau
versus
louisiana
standing
for
that
and
certainly
turner
versus
louisiana,
a
case
where
the
jury
was
taken
out
by
the
two
of
the
witnesses
over
the
deputy
sheriffs,
as
[inaudible]
v.
texas
everyone
said
that
they
were
going
to
be
fair.
so
the
fact
mr.
justice
black
that
there
was
no
evidence
actually
introduced
as
court
noted
in
marshall
versus
united
states
at
least
when
you
introduce
evidence
you
have
some
protective
proceeding
but
if
the
evidence
is
not
introduced
and
everyone
knows
about
it
anyway
there
are
no
protective
procedures.
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
your
honor
that
i
have
confined
my
remarks
to
the
record,
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
the
tapes
were
television
tapes,
video
tapes
were
taken
and
it
is
apparent
from
the
record
and
no
one
has
ever
disputed
it
that
they
were
actually
published
obviously
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
real
dispute
is
to
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that
besides
the
television
tapes,
the
allegation
in
the
petition
that
he
received
such
wide
spread
adverse
publicity
to
the
extent
that
he
could
not
receive
a
fair
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
not
the
first
juror
was
asked,
what
exactly
did
you
see
or
what
exactly
did
you
read
or
what
exactly
did
you
hear.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
the
only--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
questions
were,
will
you
give
this
boy
a
fair
trial,
have
you
expressed
an
opinion.
some
of
the
jurors
were
asked
have
you
formed
an
opinion,
but
not
the
first
juror
who
was
asked
what
had
you
seen.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
it
was
not
the
first,
direct
question
was
asked,
the
questions
were
leading
now
you
may
have
seen
something
but
will
you
give
this
boy
a
fair
trial
anyway,
this
was
the
tenor
of
the
200
people.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
have
read
the
appendix,
it's
accurate
statement
of
record.
mr.
richard
kanner
counsel
for
the
state
relies
on
beck
versus
washington
which
of
course
is,
i
say
of
course
i
feel
is
nowhere,
anywhere
close
to
being
in
point.
in
beth
there
was
lots
accusatory
publicity
but
there
was
actually
no
confessions.
i
believe
the
distinction
between
a
confession
and
other
accusatory
publicity
has
been,
i
think
is
crucial.
this
court
is,
not
this
court
the
sixth
circuit
in
shepard
versus
maxwell
noted
it
in
sixth's
circuit's
opinion
dismissing
the
shepard
petition
that
is
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
hearing
confessions
of
the
defendant
and
this
other
accusatory
publicity.
so
i
feel
mr.
justices
that
the
record
shows
that
while
there
may
not
have
been
actual
prejudice,
the
prejudice
is
inherent
in
this
entire
record
that
this
boy
was
tried
for
six
or
seven,
actually
seven
or
eight
murders
at
one
time.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
at
that
time.
i
feel
that
in
view
of
the
state's
concession
that
this
court
here
has
the
opportunity
to
declare
itself
in
favor
of
american
bar
association
projects
that
seek
to
raise
the
standards
by
which
indigent
representation
can
be
had.
i
think
the
court
has
the
opportunity
here
to
reaffirm
the
proposition
as
set
out
in
sheppard
v.
maxwell
that
sometimes
the
court,
trial
court
has
a
duty
on
its
own
to
prevent
unfairness.
i
think
this
court
has
an
opportunity
here
mr.
justices
to
establish
some
type
of
adequate
standards
to
measure
effectiveness
and
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
that
such
standards
would
reinforce
the
unanimous
mandate
of
this
court's
mandate
in
gideon
v.
wainwright
--
mr.
richard
kanner
on
page
21
of
their
brief
mr.
justice,
or
maybe
it's
on
page
20
where
it
says
the
respondent
does
not
regard
the
factual
situation
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'd
also
urge
conversely
that
to
affirm
this
decision
may
it
very
possibly
establish
a
precedent
that
this
court
possibly
might
approve
the
(inaudible)
of
the
representation
in
this
case
and
that
it
would
certainly
be
--
affirmation
of
this
case
i
believe
would
certainly
be
in
sharp
contrast
to
our
goal
of
having
equal
justice
under
the
law.
so
in
answer
again
to
and
in
summation
and
closing
i
would
again
like
to
answer
mr.
justices
stewart's
question
that
i
feel
that
in
this
case
that
the
failure
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
were
tenuous,
or
to
have
jury
instruction,
or
to
present
expert
mitigating
witnesses,
the
psychiatrist,
when
viewed
against
this
background
of
the
publicity
certainly
violated
minimum
standards
and
it's
because
it
did
violate
minimum
standards
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
to
either
--
for
either
a
new
trial
or
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
richard
kanner
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
short
time
remaining
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
fortas
and
to
get
over
the
jurisdictional
problem
what
the
third
district
did
they
said
that
it
was
a
waiver
of
a
federal
right
and
this
court's
clear
holding
that
waiver
of
federal
rights
that
is
the
question
of
publicity
is
a
federal
question.
so
what
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
this
is
for
this
court
to
decide.
now
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
as
to
your
query
as
to
raising
the
adequacy
of
counsel.
i
think
we've
got
to
go
back
here
to
the
rule
1
petition,
which
sets
out
the
counsel
without
authority
or
justification
didn't
do
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.
mr.
richard
kanner
okay
now
mr.
justice
white
without
any
type
of
hearing
the
trial
judge
says
in
response
to
the
state--
mr.
richard
kanner
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
are
not
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
that
was
not
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
they're
before
this
court
here
today.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
yes
your
honor
this
was
the
question
of
res
judicata
is
to
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
my
talking
about
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
here
is
only
to
show
that
we
were
entitled
we
should
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
the
rule
1
petition
is
--
talks
about
violation
of
duties
and
obligations
of
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
am
not
going
to--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honors
this
--
these
were
the
assignments.
the
only
order
that
the
trial
court
entered
was
saying
that
this
was
res
judicata.
this
is
the
only
thing
the
trial
judge
did.
the
trial
judge
made
no
finding
of
waiver.
there
was
no
question
of
waiver
presented
in
the
apartment
of
defense.
the
trial
judge
said
res
judicata.
now
one
last,
so
i
feel
your
honors
that
there
is
a
federal
right
here
that
the
state
court
has
–
excuse
me
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
richard
kanner
so
in
one
last,
one
last
comment,
the
voir
dire
is
still
certainly
and
effective
means
to
determine
the
fairness
of
a
trial
and
i
don't
ever
concede
that
it
isn't.
but
i
say
this
your
honors
that
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
given
the
proper
tools
by
which
they
should
perform
their
function
and
their
function
in
this
trial
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
mercy
should
have
been
extended.
so
far
as
this
function
was
concerned
i
don't
believe
that
the
jury
were
given
the
proper
tools
to
do
their
job.
i
feel
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
that
the
adequate
state
ground
that
is
troubling
some
of
the
justices
was
a
ruling
on
a
federal
ground
that
is
of
the
publicity
which
of
course
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
richard
kanner
--
whether
it
is
feasible
for
this
court
to
accept
standard
by
which
the
effectiveness
and
duty
of
a
court
appointed
trial
counsel
can
be
measured.
secondly
whether
a
court
appointed
trial
counsel
has
a
duty
to
abide
by
his
client's
instructions
during
the
pretrial
proceedings
of
the
case.
and
lastly
whether
when
this
court
held
it
was
inherently
invalid
to
hold
a
murder
trial
in
a
community
exposed
to
the
defendants
televised
confessions,
did
this
court
mean
inherently
invalid
or
mean
inherently
invalid
sometimes.
i
feel
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
decisive
to
all
of
the
issues
which
i
am
attempting
to
raise
and
i
will
discuss
them
at
some
length.
i
expect
also
to
discuss
the
need
for
an
adequate
standard
to
measure
the
effectiveness
and
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel.
i
also
expect
to
discuss
some
suggested
standards
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
american
bar
association's
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice
and
lastly
of
course
to
discuss
the
existing
precedent
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
as
to
the
facts,
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
was
17
years
old,
he
is
white,
of
average
to
above
average
in
intelligence.
he
has
a
tenth
grade
education.
he
and
his
family
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
resided
in
california,
so
that
when
he
was
apprehended
near
west
palm
beach,
he
was
out
without
of
either
a
counsel
or
family.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
i
expect
to
discuss
that
on
to
the
topic
of
the
test
in
determining
the
adequacy
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
feel
that
the
failure
to
present
such
testimony
your
honor
is
one
of
the
indications
to
show
that
trial
counsel
completely
abandoned
all
defenses
that
were
applicable
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
mr.
justice.
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
immediately
confessed
to
an
additional
seven
homicides
all
committed
in
the
perpetration
of
robbery.
all
of
these
homicides
were
committed
within
the
period
of
30
days;
one
in
california,
three
i
believe
in
arizona
and
four
in
florida.
the
four
that
were
in
committed
in
south
florida
were
all
committed
within
that
past
week.
the
defendant
as
i
say
was
apprehended
in
west
palm
beach
and
immediately
the
next
day
on
march
6th
of
1960
he
was
taken
to
miami
where
he
again
repeated
these
confessions
to
these
eight
separate
homicides,
this
time
your
honors
in
the
presence
of
television
cameras,
radio
microphones
and
of
course
the
news
media.
the
defendant
was
returned
to
west
palm
beach
in
may
where
he
was
convicted
and
given
a
recommendation
of
mercy
which
in
florida
is
automatically
means
life.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
so
far
as
the
rule
one,
the
post
collateral
attack
petition
is
concerned
your
honor,
we'll
strike
that.
it
does
not
say
live
or
taped.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
i
have
only
examined
the
record
i
don't
know,
other
than
what
the
rule
1
--
what
i've
alleged
in
the
rule
1
petition.
the
defendant
was
returned
to
miami
in
may
and
counsel
were
appointed
for
him.
counsel
made
a
motion
for
the
appointment
of
the
psychiatrist
to
determine
his
competency.
two
were
appointed
and
three
examined
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
found
competent
by
all
of
the
three
psychiatrists
and
competent
to
stand
trial
and
know
right
from
wrong.
their
opinions
ran
the
range
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
mere
personality
disorder
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
severe
psychosis,
that
is
almost
out
of
touch
with
reality,
although
still
able
to
know
right
from
wrong.
the
psychiatrist
who
had
not
been
formally
appointed
two
weeks
before
his
trial
filed
his
report
and
this
psychiatrist
said
i
can
state
unequivocally
that
without
further
advances
in
the
psychiatric
field
this
boy
will
a
menace
to
society
as
long
as
he
may
live.
counsel
were
asked
by
the
petitioner
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
but
they
failed
to
do
so.
so
to
please
the
court
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
defendant
went
on
trial
for
his
life
in
june.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
they
were
court
appointed
counsel
your
honor.
after
the
selection,
after
the
voir
dire
and
the
selection
of
the
jury
the
defendant
freely
and
voluntarily
and
on
the
advise
of
his
counsel
and
on
the
advise
of
his
two
sisters
and
his
brother
who
had
come
from
california
to
the
trial
signed
what
was
denominated
as
a
“stipulation”
which
in
effect
was
a
plea
of
guilty
because
it
admitted
facts,
all
of
the
necessary
facts
necessary
to
constitute
murder
in
the
first
degree
of
this
person
in
question.
the
defendant
was
not
taken
before
the
trial
court
prior
to
the
introduction
of
the
stipulation
into
evidence.
so
the
trial
was
limited
as
it
was
to
the
judicial
stipulation.
there
were
some
corroborating
physical
evidence,
corroborating
the
confession
of
stipulation
and
also
the
defendant's
own
testimony
as
to
his
earlier
environment.
there
was
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
the
stipulation
was
in
fact
a
confession.
it
said
that,
it's
on
page
40
of
the
--
39
of
the
record.
it
says
that
the
defendant
did
go
into
this
gas
station.
mr.
richard
kanner
this
was
not
set
out
in
the
stipulation
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
was
also
introduced
your
honor,
you
are
correct.
mr.
richard
kanner
a
recording
of
his
confessions
which
he
made
in
palm
beach,
strike
that.
a
recording
of
the
confessions
as
to
this
particular
crime
which
he
made
in
palm
beach
was
introduced,
that
is
in
palm
beach
he
made
this
confessions
to
all
of
these
crimes
on
a,
gray
audograph
disk,
that
portion
of
his
confessions
on
the
gray
audograph
disk
applicable
to
this
particular
murder
was
played
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
why
it
was
played
to
the
jury.
there
is
testimony
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition
proceeding
which
is
in
the
record
before
this
court
that
the
--
the
stipulation
was
entered
on
a
quid
pro
quo
basis,
that
is
that
the
state
would
certain
things
and
limit
their
evidence
providing
the
stipulation
was
signed.
there
is
actually
nothing
in
the
stipulation
itself
or
any
copies
of
the
stipulation
as
to
exactly
what
the
consideration
was
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
stipulation
mr.
justice
as
to
whether
any
promises
were
made
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
argument
that
the
state
advanced
at
the
habeas
corpus
petition
which
was
accepted
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
certiorari
was
denied.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice,
as
to
whether
those
witnesses
would
be
relevant
in
florida
if
not
before
this
court.
so
as
i
say
the
trial
was
limited
to
the
stipulation.
there
was
the
gray
audograph
disk
and
some
corroborating
testimony
in
the
defendant's
trial.
there
was
no
mitigating
testimony
at
all
from
the
psychiatrist,
nor
was
there
the
first
instruction
for
the
jury.
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
a
stipulation
and
it
leaves
to
you
the
sole
question
of
mercy
you
are
to
disregard
any
publicity
that
you
may
have
learned
about
the
defendant
and
you
are
to
base
the
decision
on
mercy
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
that
was
not
the
first
instruction,
not
the
first
word
from
this
court,
that
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned,
that
the
jury
had
to
limit
its
deliberations
to
the
facts,
to
the
evidence
presented
at
this
trial.
the
jury
did
return
a
verdict
without
a
recommendation
of
mercy.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
however
by
i
what
i've
said
heretofore
that
counsel
or
proforma
in
their
representation
of
this
boy
so
far
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned
because
they
were
not,
counsel
moved
for
such
discovery
as
available
in
florida
and
they
also
moved
to
some
discovery
that
was
not
available
in
florida
such
as
his
testimony
at
the
palm
beach
trial.
they
also
moved
for
a
list
of
witnesses
and
the
bill
of
particulars
and
they
asked
to
hire
ballistics
and
fingerprint
experts.
so
as
far
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
concerned
i
don't
wish
to
leave
any
implication
to
the
court
that
trial
counsel,
defense
versus
proforma
because
so
far
as
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned
up
to
the
assigning
of
the
stipulation
it
was
not
proforma
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
counsel's
recommendation
mr.
justice
marshall
assigned
the
stipulation.
my
quarrel
with
counsel
is
that
having
entered
into
the
stipulation,
they
completely
abandoned
this
boy.
they
made
no
attempt,
no
effort
to
insulate
him
from
the
affects
of
this
publicity.
the
appeal
again
ignored
the
publicity.
it
was
limited
to
the
inability
of
trial
counsel
to
challenge
members
of
the
grand
jury,
the
prejudicial
final
argument
and
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
found
the
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
is
a
former
assistant
municipal
judge
for
the
city
of
miami.
at
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
nothing
in
this
record
and
nothing
in
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
was
not
even
living
in
miami
at
the
time.
the
counsel
from
his
earlier
case
in
west
palm
beach,
then
entered
the
case
and
filed
an
original
petition
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
alleging
that
the
judicial
stipulation
was
entered
into
on
the
express
agreement
or
guarantee
of
this
trial
counsel
that
the
defendant's
life
would
be
spared
with
the
signing
of
this
stipulation.
the
florida
supreme
court
appointed
a
commissioner
who
heard
extensive
hearings
and
he
--
the
commissioner
recommended
to
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
facts
were
not
as
proven.
mr.
richard
kanner
the
jury,
your
honor,
with
a
recommendation
of
mercy
that
is
the
seven
of
the
12
jurors
in
florida
must
recommend
mercy
and
it's
mandatory
in
florida.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
this
was
the
argument
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
petition.
it
was
denied
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
this
court
has
denied
certiorari.
i
don't
expect
to
get
into
it,
but
i
only
bring
this
up
is
to
show
the
present
posture
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
black
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
that
is
correct.
the
petitioner
that
in
proper
person
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
jacksonville
a
habeas
corpus
petition
alleging
for
the
first
time
that
the
listing
had
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
the
united
states
district
judge
denied
the
petition
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
court
had
not
been
given
the
opportunity
as
yet
to
rule
on
that
matter.
after
which
the
petitioner
filed
his
pro
se
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
concurred
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
judge,
stayed
his
execution,
where
upon
the
petitioner
with
counsel
filed
his
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
the
florida
circuit
court,
the
trial
court.
our
post
conviction
of
collateral
attack
statute,
our
rule
is
identical
with
the
federal
2255
proceeding.
the
rule
1
petition
made
no
allegation,
though
that
his
trial
was
unfair
so
far
as
guilt
or
innocence
was
concerned.
defendant
has
always
conceded
his
guilt,
but
as
rule
1
petition
laid
down
in
length
what
that
it
was
that
his
trial
so
far
as
guilt
or,
so
far
mercy
was
concerned
was
unclear.
and
this
mr.
justice
fortas
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
suggest
that
his
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
was
unfair
because
of
the
failure
to
defense
counsel
to
call
the
expert
mitigating
witnesses.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
your
honor
in
florida
it
is
normally
one
proceeding.
when
the
advent
of
the
judicial
stipulation
or
confession,
the
only
issue
mr.
justice
before
the
jury
was
the
question
of
mercy.
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
no
longer
a
part
of
the
determination
by
the
jury
because
the
facts
have
been
stipulated.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
that
is
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
reason
for
them
to
introduce
one
witness
who
establish
venue
but
they
did.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
only
saying
your
honor
that
so
far
as
the
rule
1
petition
was
concerned,
it
conceded
his
guilt,
but
it
is
alleged
that
the
publicity
inter
alia
was
a
factor
which
precluded
him
from
receiving
a
fair
trail
on
the
question
of
mercy.
mr.
richard
kanner
now,
the
trial
judge
in
an
ex
parte
order
required
the
state
to
file
a
reply
which
they
did.
the
state
denied
all
of
the
allegations
in
the
rule
1
proceeding
and
further
by
way
of
affirmative
defense,
the
state
said
that
the
habeas
corpus
ruling
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
direct
appeal
were
res
judicata
as
to
all
of
the
issues
which
were
raised
in
the
collateral
attack.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black
in
florida
mercy
is
within
the
sole
discretion
of
the
jury
and
whatever
evidence
the
defendant
may
wish
to
offer
in
that
regard
can't
be
received.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
don't
understand
that.
mr.
richard
kanner
on
the
sentence
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
on
the
sentence,
not
on
the
conviction
but
on
the
sentence.
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
but
i
don't
say
that
it's
unfair
if
you
were
to
take
--
isolate
this
one
instance.
i
say
that
it
is
unfair
when
viewed
in
the
background
of
the
publicity
and
when
viewed
in
the
background
of
failing
to
have
the
court
give
instructions
to
attempt
to
insulate
the
defendant
from
the
publicity.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'm
saying
it
was
unconstitutional
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
his
counsel,
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
rule
1
petition
which
have
to
be
taken
at
this
point
as
being
true,
is
that
his
counsel
refused
to
put
on
the
expert
psychiatric
witnesses
without
cause
or
justification.
i
think
this
is
the
issue
that
this
case
boils
down
to
mr.
justice,
is
whether
these
acts
of
counsel
are
going
to
be
imputed
to
the
client
and
i
believe
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
brennan
if
this
court
holds
that
the
standard
of
trial
advocacy
in
this
case
fell
so
far
below
that
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
prescribes,
then
he
is
going
to
get
a
new
trial
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
only
because
in
florida
we
have
no
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor,
as
to
whether
his
stipulation
would
still
be
admissible
into
evidence
that
i
don't
know.
so
is
the
--
the
trial
judge
denied
the
rule
1
proceedings
on
the
grounds
of
res
judicata
that
was
replied
to
by
the
state
after
which
an
appeal
was
taken
to
our
intermediate
florida
court.
now
our
florida
intermediate
court
recognized
sanders
versus
united
states
and
said
that
res
judicata
was
absolutely
not
applicable
on
the
rule,
on
the
collateral
attack
proceedings.
but
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
did
say
that
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
exhaust
his
peremptory
challenge
and
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
and
then
in
reliance
on
the
sixth
circuit's
shepherd
lee
maxwell
case
precluded
raising
the
publicity
issue
in
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
no
appellate
court
has
the
power
to
tell
a
trial
court
or
to
tell
the
trial
court
jury
that
it
should
recommend
mercy.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
my
research
has
not
found
a
case
on
this
point
pro
or
con.
i
think
that
i
may
have
--
i
have
confused
the
court
by
conceding
the
guilt
of
this
defendant
and
only
subjecting
my
argument
to
the
question
of
mercy.
there's
a
practical
and
there's
an
actual
matter
as
you
understand
mr.
justice
that
is
what
i
am
complaining
about.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
this
mr.
justice
that
if
this
court
feels
that
it
is
possible
to
establish
guidelines,
to
test
one
the
effectiveness
and
two
the
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
and
then
finds
that
such
guidelines
or
standards
were
violated
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
were
concerned
then
i
feel
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
reverse
it.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
know
whether
the
judicial
confession
would
be
admissible
or
not.
he
had
his
counsel
there.
he
had
his
sisters
there.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
would
presume
on
the
random
that
it
would
not
be.
so
as
i
say
i
expect
to
discuss
one;
the
need
for
adequate
standards
to
measure
the
duty
and
effectiveness
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
and
secondly
some
suggested
standards
and
lastly
the
applicable
precedent.
mr.
justice
has
asked
for
the
need.
35
years
ago
in
carl
versus
alabama
this
court
laid
down
the
mandate
that
counsel
should
render
effective
and
substantial
aid.
up
until
this
case,
i
don't
believe
the
question
as
to
what
effective
and
substantial
aid
has
come
up.
it
came
up
to
the
slight
extent
in
avery
versus
alabama
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
not
violated.
this
court
did
in
it's
supervisory
power
over
the
federal
courts
in
alaska
versus
united
states
hold
that
when
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
co-counsel
that
there
was
not
aid,
the
counsel
was
not
“as
effective
as
it
might
have
been.”
now
your
honors
with
the
advent
of
gideon
v.
wainwright
and
the
proliferation
of
court
appointed
counsel
throughout
the
state
systems,
i
feel
that
there
is
now
a
need
for
some
adequate
guidelines
to
test
what
is
duty
and
what
is
the
criteria
for
effective
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
it
is
this
your
honor,
they
did
not
question
the
court
to
give
any
instructions
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
was
required
to
limit
the
deliberations
on
mercy
to
the
record
in
this
case.
secondly
i
feel
that
trial
counsel
went
below
what
is
normal
or
fair
representation
when
they
did
not
put
on
the
mitigating
circumstances.
thirdly
i
think
counsel
was
derelict
regardless
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
the
three
psychiatrists
who
examined
this
boy,
all
agreed
that
he
was
very
sick,
that
he
wanted
be
helped
and
that
his
mental
illness,
at
least
one
of
them
said
that
it
boarded
on
a
psychosis
that
is
that
he
was
--
had
lost
touch
of
reality.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honor
i
am
complaining
that
the
court--
mr.
richard
kanner
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
kanner
he
would
have
charged
–
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
there
is
no
law
on
that,
except
that
the
law
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
the
law
in
florida
which
i
believe
would
necessitate
a
charge
is
that
in
florida
and
we
have
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
so
holding,
that
the
trial
on
the
question
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
that's
correct.
an
analogous
example,
shepherd
v.
maxwell
this
court
held
that
often
trial
judge
has
an
obligation
sua
sponte
to
make
such
effective
controls
as
maybe
necessary
to
ensure
a
fair
trial
and
i
feel
certainly
insofar
as
instructions
on
the
question
of
mercy
were
concerned
mr.
justice
black
that
there
was
an
obligation
one
on
trial
counsel
and
two
failure
of
trial
counsel
i
feel
there
was
an
obligation
sua
sponte
for
the
court.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
prepared
the
petition
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
those
are
exactly
the
questions
which
i
want
this
court
to
answer
mr.
justice.
my
argue
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
my
stating
the
questions
here
in
oral
argument
is
only
to
show
that
there
wasn't
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
your
honor
and
i
only
say
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
because
of
these
factors
which
i
have
alleged
in
my
brief.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
marshall
we
have
--
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
so
we
have
nothing
but
the
rule
1
allegation
which
says
the
defendant
requesting
his
court
appointed
counsel
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
but
they
did
not
do
so.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice,
if
i
were
to
redraft
the
petition
and
presuming
that
i
thought
that
i
could
prove
it.
i'm
certain
that
i
would
specify
time,
place
and
date
and
the
exact
language
of
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
in
these
circumstances
with
the
background
of
the
televised
confessions
i
feel
that
in
these
circumstances
mr.
justice
that
it
was.
mr.
richard
kanner
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not.
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
and
my
argument
is
to
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
is
only
to
show
in
these
circumstances
that
the
record
conclusively
shows
that
a
post
conviction
evidentiary
hearing
was
required.
counsel
for
the
state
has
conceded
that
there's
no
question
of
waiver
or
adequate
independent
state
grounds
to
support
the
appellate
court.
if
the
record
is
the
statement,
would
have
the
court
believe
showed
positively
that
the
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
were
a
fair
one,
then
there
would
be
no
due
process
question.
my
argument
mr.
justices
is
that
the
state
contends
one
that
the
voir
dire
conclusively
shows
that
the
trial
on
mercy
was
fair.
i
say
mr.
justices
that
the
voir
dire
or
no
voir
dire,
the
trial
on
the
question
of
mercy
was
not
fair
for
reasons
one,
two
and
three
and
that
we
either
need
to
have
this
case
reversed,
if
this
court
is
going
to
have
minimum
trial
standards
or
two
if
the
court
rules
that
it
is
a
duty
then
this
court
has
--
the
case
has
to
be
reversed
for
only
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
this
is
one
of
the
remedies
that
this
court
can
do,
if
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
sir,
unless
this
court
propitiously
on
it's
own
feels
that
such
error
is
--
such
unfairness
is
substantiated
in
the
record
and
the
reason
i
put
it
this
way,
is
that
this
case
is
not
quite
rideau
v.
louisiana,
because
the
only
thing
that
shows
actual
i
think
if
there
was
positive
testimony
of
18
people
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
that
they
had
seen
televised
confessions
of
the
defendant.
i
think
this
court
on
it's
own
could
reverse
this
case,
but
so
far
as
the
actual
publication
of
these
televised
confessions
were
concerned,
it's
--
i
only
gathered
from
the
questions
on
the
voir
dire
from
the
state
attorney
and
that's
primarily
and
the
--
there's
no
question
about
what
the
televised
confessions
were
taped
as
positive
testimony
is
to
that,
but
so
far
their
publication
i
only
gathered
this
from
the
voir
dire
questions
for
the
state
attorney.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
because
your
honor
in
reliance
on
sixth
circuit
sheppard
versus
maxwell
there
was
no
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
though
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
that's
excellent
what
the
law
is
in
florida
now
this
is
a
case
that
we're
appealing
from
--
mr.
richard
kanner
because
there
this
is
a
limitation
on
florida's
--
in
effect
of
limitations
on
florida's
collateral
remedy.
this
is
--
fay
v.
noia
was
a
federal
case,
not
a
state
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
with
fay
versus
noia
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
say
i
am
familiar
your
honor
with
fay
versus
noia.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
well,
it's
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
--
mr.
richard
kanner
whether
i'm
properly
this
court
or
not.
i
feel
that
if
there
is
such
thing
as
standards
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
richard
kanner
which
point
mr.
justice?
mr.
richard
kanner
well
they
had
conceded
that
there
is
no
adequate
statement.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
i
--
the
reason
that
i
my
oral
argument
is
taken
the
tact
that
it
has
is
because
the
state
says
that
he
received
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
question
of
waiver.
on
page
21
of
the
state's
brief,
the
state
says,
if
i
can
quote
that
in
a
second,
the
state
does
not
regard
of
the
factual
situation
in
the
instant
matter
as
being
a
waiver
of
petitioner's
rights.
it
is
state's
position
because
the
jury
was
in
fact
fair
and
impartial
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
were
preserved
by
his
counsel
and
consequently
there
was
no
waiver.
but
in
view
of
this
concession
i
think
that
--
so
far
as
argument
is
concerned
that
i
have
to
come
forward
to
show
that
the
constitutional
rights
were
not
preserved
because
of
items
one,
two
and
three.
the
present
test
to
determine
the
adequacy
of
court
appointed
counsel
was
whether
such
trial
resulted
in
a
farce.
and
i
hardly
feel
that
this
standard
approaches
anywhere
close
to
the
level
of,
this
court
laid
down
last
term
in
anders
versus
california
where
appellate
counsel,
that
is
a
counsel
must
be
an
active
advocate.
the
--
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
just
numerous
recent
law
review
articles.
there
is
numerous
recent
editorials
and
articles
in
the
american
bar
general
and
of
course
the
american
bar
association's
project
to
establish
minimum
standards
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
all
of
these
articles
to
attempt
to
show
that
there
is
some
need
to
establish
minimum
standards
and
if
there
are
any
type
of
minimum
standards
whatsoever
then
such
minimum
standards
were
violated
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
as
to
regardless
or
irregardless
of
any
request
or
suggestion
or
demand
by
client
i
think
there
was
a
failure
to
move
or
change
of
venue
or
at
least
they
continue
was
one,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
second
was
failure
to
exempt
the
litigating
expert
testimony
from
the
psychiatrist
and
lastly
was
to
request
an
instruction
from
the
court
to
the
jury
and
so
far
as
the
question
of
mercy
was
concerned
that
this
jury
had
to
disregard
all
of
the
attendant
publicity
of
that
--
these
other
six
or
seven
murders
and
limit
its
discussion
on
the
question
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
of
course
it
is
and
there
was
an
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
the
jury
shall
make
its
determination
of
facts
on
this,
on
this
record,
or
this
evidence
or
was
one
cause
of
the
sentence.
so
far
as
the
question
of
fact
was
concerned
that
the
jury
should
confine
itself
to
the
evidence,
but
of
course
there
were
no
facts
to
decide.
now
as
to
the
applicability
of
existing
precedent
the
state
has
as
i've
read
has
conceded
that
there
was
no
waiver.
they
have
–
and
the
state
of
florida
now
recognizes
that
res
judicata
is
not
actually
applicable
in
matters
which
let's
say
are
actually
raised.
the
state
has
made
no
explanation
as
to
why
there
was
no
instruction
relative
to
publicity
immensely
or
why
that
there
was
no
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
or
instruction.
mr.
richard
kanner
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
black
the
whole
record
trial
and
habeas
corpus
is
replete
with
comments
about
taking
this
boy's
picture
in
front
of
the
television.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
your
honor
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
in
rideau
versus
louisiana
and
more
probably
more
particularly
pointed
in
marshall
versus
united
states.
marshall
v.
united
states
was
a
case
where
trial
was
in
progress
and
they
sequestered
or
they
broke
through
the
night
recessed
and
there
was
evidence
in
marshall
prior
records
or
convictions
of
the
defendant
which
would
not
be
admissible
and
the
trial
judge
in
marshall
took
each
of
the
jurors
into
his
chambers
and
asked
them
will
you
disregard
this.
and
each
of
the
juror
said
certainly
we
will
and
we
will
base
our
record
on
the
evidence,
base
our
verdict
on
the
evidence.
this
court
nevertheless
reversed.
i
feel
that
the
reasoning
in
irvin
versus
dowd,
mr.
justice
black
is
that
sometimes
when
things
can
be
so
bad
that
regardless
of
presence
or
absence
of
what
a
juror
says
that
the
case
has
to
be
reversed.
we've
got
rideau
versus
louisiana
standing
for
that
and
certainly
turner
versus
louisiana,
a
case
where
the
jury
was
taken
out
by
the
two
of
the
witnesses
over
the
deputy
sheriffs,
as
[inaudible]
v.
texas
everyone
said
that
they
were
going
to
be
fair.
so
the
fact
mr.
justice
black
that
there
was
no
evidence
actually
introduced
as
court
noted
in
marshall
versus
united
states
at
least
when
you
introduce
evidence
you
have
some
protective
proceeding
but
if
the
evidence
is
not
introduced
and
everyone
knows
about
it
anyway
there
are
no
protective
procedures.
mr.
richard
kanner
excuse
me
mr.
justice
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
richard
kanner
only
your
honor
that
i
have
confined
my
remarks
to
the
record,
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
the
tapes
were
television
tapes,
video
tapes
were
taken
and
it
is
apparent
from
the
record
and
no
one
has
ever
disputed
it
that
they
were
actually
published
obviously
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
real
dispute
is
to
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that
besides
the
television
tapes,
the
allegation
in
the
petition
that
he
received
such
wide
spread
adverse
publicity
to
the
extent
that
he
could
not
receive
a
fair
--
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
white
not
the
first
juror
was
asked,
what
exactly
did
you
see
or
what
exactly
did
you
read
or
what
exactly
did
you
hear.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
the
only--
mr.
richard
kanner
the
questions
were,
will
you
give
this
boy
a
fair
trial,
have
you
expressed
an
opinion.
some
of
the
jurors
were
asked
have
you
formed
an
opinion,
but
not
the
first
juror
who
was
asked
what
had
you
seen.
mr.
richard
kanner
no
your
honor
it
was
not
the
first,
direct
question
was
asked,
the
questions
were
leading
now
you
may
have
seen
something
but
will
you
give
this
boy
a
fair
trial
anyway,
this
was
the
tenor
of
the
200
people.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
have
read
the
appendix,
it's
accurate
statement
of
record.
mr.
richard
kanner
counsel
for
the
state
relies
on
beck
versus
washington
which
of
course
is,
i
say
of
course
i
feel
is
nowhere,
anywhere
close
to
being
in
point.
in
beth
there
was
lots
accusatory
publicity
but
there
was
actually
no
confessions.
i
believe
the
distinction
between
a
confession
and
other
accusatory
publicity
has
been,
i
think
is
crucial.
this
court
is,
not
this
court
the
sixth
circuit
in
shepard
versus
maxwell
noted
it
in
sixth's
circuit's
opinion
dismissing
the
shepard
petition
that
is
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
hearing
confessions
of
the
defendant
and
this
other
accusatory
publicity.
so
i
feel
mr.
justices
that
the
record
shows
that
while
there
may
not
have
been
actual
prejudice,
the
prejudice
is
inherent
in
this
entire
record
that
this
boy
was
tried
for
six
or
seven,
actually
seven
or
eight
murders
at
one
time.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir
at
that
time.
i
feel
that
in
view
of
the
state's
concession
that
this
court
here
has
the
opportunity
to
declare
itself
in
favor
of
american
bar
association
projects
that
seek
to
raise
the
standards
by
which
indigent
representation
can
be
had.
i
think
the
court
has
the
opportunity
here
to
reaffirm
the
proposition
as
set
out
in
sheppard
v.
maxwell
that
sometimes
the
court,
trial
court
has
a
duty
on
its
own
to
prevent
unfairness.
i
think
this
court
has
an
opportunity
here
mr.
justices
to
establish
some
type
of
adequate
standards
to
measure
effectiveness
and
duty
of
court
appointed
trial
counsel
that
such
standards
would
reinforce
the
unanimous
mandate
of
this
court's
mandate
in
gideon
v.
wainwright
--
mr.
richard
kanner
on
page
21
of
their
brief
mr.
justice,
or
maybe
it's
on
page
20
where
it
says
the
respondent
does
not
regard
the
factual
situation
--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
kanner
i'd
also
urge
conversely
that
to
affirm
this
decision
may
it
very
possibly
establish
a
precedent
that
this
court
possibly
might
approve
the
(inaudible)
of
the
representation
in
this
case
and
that
it
would
certainly
be
--
affirmation
of
this
case
i
believe
would
certainly
be
in
sharp
contrast
to
our
goal
of
having
equal
justice
under
the
law.
so
in
answer
again
to
and
in
summation
and
closing
i
would
again
like
to
answer
mr.
justices
stewart's
question
that
i
feel
that
in
this
case
that
the
failure
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
were
tenuous,
or
to
have
jury
instruction,
or
to
present
expert
mitigating
witnesses,
the
psychiatrist,
when
viewed
against
this
background
of
the
publicity
certainly
violated
minimum
standards
and
it's
because
it
did
violate
minimum
standards
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
to
either
--
for
either
a
new
trial
or
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
richard
kanner
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
short
time
remaining
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
fortas
and
to
get
over
the
jurisdictional
problem
what
the
third
district
did
they
said
that
it
was
a
waiver
of
a
federal
right
and
this
court's
clear
holding
that
waiver
of
federal
rights
that
is
the
question
of
publicity
is
a
federal
question.
so
what
the
--
mr.
richard
kanner
this
is
for
this
court
to
decide.
now
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
as
to
your
query
as
to
raising
the
adequacy
of
counsel.
i
think
we've
got
to
go
back
here
to
the
rule
1
petition,
which
sets
out
the
counsel
without
authority
or
justification
didn't
do
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.
mr.
richard
kanner
okay
now
mr.
justice
white
without
any
type
of
hearing
the
trial
judge
says
in
response
to
the
state--
mr.
richard
kanner
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
are
not
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
that
was
not
res
judicata.
mr.
richard
kanner
they're
before
this
court
here
today.
mr.
richard
kanner
well,
yes
your
honor
this
was
the
question
of
res
judicata
is
to
one,
two,
three,
four,
five.
mr.
richard
kanner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
kanner
mr.
justice
my
talking
about
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
here
is
only
to
show
that
we
were
entitled
we
should
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
the
rule
1
petition
is
--
talks
about
violation
of
duties
and
obligations
of
trial.
mr.
richard
kanner
i
am
not
going
to--
mr.
richard
kanner
yes
your
honors
this
--
these
were
the
assignments.
the
only
order
that
the
trial
court
entered
was
saying
that
this
was
res
judicata.
this
is
the
only
thing
the
trial
judge
did.
the
trial
judge
made
no
finding
of
waiver.
there
was
no
question
of
waiver
presented
in
the
apartment
of
defense.
the
trial
judge
said
res
judicata.
now
one
last,
so
i
feel
your
honors
that
there
is
a
federal
right
here
that
the
state
court
has
–
excuse
me
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
richard
kanner
so
in
one
last,
one
last
comment,
the
voir
dire
is
still
certainly
and
effective
means
to
determine
the
fairness
of
a
trial
and
i
don't
ever
concede
that
it
isn't.
but
i
say
this
your
honors
that
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
given
the
proper
tools
by
which
they
should
perform
their
function
and
their
function
in
this
trial
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
mercy
should
have
been
extended.
so
far
as
this
function
was
concerned
i
don't
believe
that
the
jury
were
given
the
proper
tools
to
do
their
job.
i
feel
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
that
the
adequate
state
ground
that
is
troubling
some
of
the
justices
was
a
ruling
on
a
federal
ground
that
is
of
the
publicity
which
of
course
is
a
federal
question.
