justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
confession
set
out
in
stipulation
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand
but
was
the
--
how
about
his
pretrial
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
introduced?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
--
so
the
televised
confession
was
not
played
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
only
that
part
of
the
previous
confession
that
related
to
this
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
was
that
played
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes
but
the
jury
still
had
to
believe
them
and
come
in
with
the
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise
i
see
no
other
release
for
the
stipulation
to
hold
up,
i
see
no
reason
for
the
state
introducing
collateral
–
corroborative
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
verdict,
the
jury
comes
back
with
the
verdict
guilt
with
or
without
mercy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
reversed
i
would
suppose
that
there
would
be
no
confession
evidence
to
the
subsequent
retrial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
at
the
pretrial?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
the
--
what
did
the
district
court
of
appeals,
is
that
what
you
call
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
of
appeals
have
a
reason
for
affirming
the
denial
of
hearing
on
this
particular
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
court
said
in
term
the
decisions
of
trial
court
on
this
point
and
it
said
and
this
were
the
reason,
they
said
no
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
it
the
law
in
florida
that
the
secondary
and
collateral
relief
is
not
available
on
publicity
matters
where
no
change
of
venue
has
been
made,
which
is
in
effect
to
say
that
the
remedy
in
florida
is
to
make
a
changes,
make
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
prior
to
trial
and
if
you
haven't
made
it
you
have
to
get
--
you
can't
go
any
other
way.
now,
that's
what
that
that
means
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
that
the
state
is
given
this
point
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
stated
on
the
--
that
this
inadequate
state
ground
for
denying
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
statement.
do
you
think
that
they
--
did
you
think
they
really
focused
on
this
particular
point
and
so
–
i
know
i've
got
their
brief
and
i
wondered
if
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
of
the,
how
about
the
jurors
that
we
are
actually
chosen
by
the
case,
any
of
them
ever,
did
they
admit
having
seen
the
television
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
on
voir
dire?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
defendant's
counsel's
name?
which
one
is
he
in
the
voir
dire?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defense
counsel
had
complete
opportunity
to
question
each
juror?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
of
course
your
ground
if
you
just
–
you
spoke
of
--
it's
not
a
ground
i
believe
there
are
--
that
was
articulated
by
either
at
the
trial
court
which
dismissed
this
petition
and
nor
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
confirmed
it,
and
isn't
the
reason
that
district
court
appeals
gave,
it
was
saying
that
on
this
point
there
need
to
be
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
said
in
its
opinion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
court
said
he
didn't
move
for
a
change
of
venue
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
a
state,
that
sounds
like
a
state
ground
that
you
either
move
to
change
the
venue,
where
you
had
that
collateral
relief.
that's
what
it
sounds
like.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
argument
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
his
--
was
this
--
was
the
argument
about
denial
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
raised
in
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
the
district
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
certainly
didn't
pass
on
it
as
respects
the
publicity
failure
to
move
for
change
of
venue.
they
did
talk
about
the
psychiatric
witnesses,
but
the
only
--
they
just
tied
it
down
as
being
raised
and
none
of
them
have
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
came
and
said
the
following
matters
are
not
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
listed
everything
except
that
paragraph.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
listed
everything
except
the
paragraph
dealing
with
your
allegations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
think
you
took
a
look
before
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
the
same
kind
of
errors
that
you
list
that
the
court
of
appeals
lists
as
having
been
read.
justice
