justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
determines
life
and
death
under
the
florida
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
on
some
assurance
if
they
don't
give
a
life
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
i
don't
want
to
jump
ahead,
you're
making
your
third
point
of
the
publicity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
this
court
ever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
thing
i
don't
quite
understand
if
you
would
have
prevail
here,
would
he
got
a
new
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
well
as
on
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
some
of
your
argument
is
addressed
then
to
the
conviction
itself
as
well
as
to
the
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose,
suppose
if
you
did
prevail,
but
not
on
that
ground,
but
on
the
other
ground
would
he
not
be
entitled
in
light
of
the
form
of
this
verdict
a
new
trial
and
guilt
or
innocence
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kanner
i
don't
have
your
petition
for
certiorari.
did
i
understand
correctly,
the
point
there
was
the
error
below
is
failure
to
accord
a
hearing
in
post
conviction,
on
a
post
conviction
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
so
what
remedy
could
we
give
you
beyond
saying
that
there
was
error
and
not
giving
you
a
hearing
on
all
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
brief
concludes
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
well,
no
you
started,
you
are
entitled
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
who
the
trial,
request
of
mercy
was
unfair
and/or
new
the
trial
if
such
unfairness
is
substantiated.
so
really
all
that
you're
asking
us
to
do
now,
is
to
say
that
there
was
error
and
not
affording
your
hearing
on
these
allegations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
wonder
mr.
kanner
if
that
settled,
if
your
property
--
the
court
you
should
have
gone
to
is
the
federal
habeas
corpus,
not
here--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
fay
v.
noia
was
a
new
york
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
a
required
notice
was
not
available
for
some
such
procedural
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
would
that
have
been
on
the
fay
v.
noia
is
that
the
place
you
should
have
gone,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
instead
of
coming
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not,
no
question
were
put
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
was
the
question
that
was
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
were
--
were
they,
any
asked
have
you
read
any
thing
about
this
case
in
the
papers
or
seen
anything
about
it
on
television?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask?
did
the
fact
of
televising
of
this
confession
become
known
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
trial
when
any
other
respect
was
brought
into
the
trial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
the
original
file
record
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
you
fellows
seem
to
get
there
lately?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understood
you
to
say
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
judge
goldman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kanner
may
i
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
a
different
subject.
justice
white
asked
earlier
the
opinion
of
your
appellate
court
is
not
to
be
read
as
holding,
that
because
there
was
no
request
for
a
change
of
venue,
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
these
allegations.
now,
on
the
premise
that's
the
way
it
is
to
be
read
and
i
must
say
it
strikes
to
me
that's
the
way
it
is
to
be
read,
is
the
state
of
florida
telling
us
that
this
is
not
an
adequate
state
ground
for
denying
him
an
evidentiary
hearing
under
your
post
conviction
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
may
hate
it
but
let
me
suggest
you
that
it
has
a
very
great
bearing
on
our
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
not
agree
with
it
but
i
expect
we
have
to,
we're
governed
by
it
and
in
fact
an
adequate
state
ground,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
court
held,
whatever
might
be
your
view
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
there
interval
between
the
date
of
his
arrest
in
west
palm
beach
and
the
date
of
his
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
anything
--
because
we
don't
know
at
all
when
if
ever
the
state
televised
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
it
was
close
to
trial
or
rather
back
at
the
time
of
arrest,
we
know
nothing
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
i'm
looking
at
462
and
463
of
the
record,
do
you
have
it
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
apparently
are
the
assignments
of
error
before
your
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
difficulty
finding,
perhaps
you
can
point
out
to
me.
under
which
of
any
of
these
or
how
many
of
them
is
there
subsumed
this
point
of
denial
of
effective
assistance
to
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
i
asked,
justice
white
asking
i
think
both
of
you
and
mr.
kanner
earlier,
certainly
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
makes
no
reference
to
an
issue
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
i
just
suggest
i
think
it's
understandable,
that,
that
point
wasn't
raised
as
i
read
these
assignments
of
error,
i
don't
see
that
it
was
ever
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals,
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
another
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
they
may
have
listened
to
him
but
they
certainly
didn't
address
themselves
to
it
in
their
opinion,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
just
don't
read
it
that
way
mr.
kanner
i
read
it
there
is
nothing
more
than
a
determination,
decisive
like
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
fay
and
noia.
fay
and
noia
was
a
case
where
he
had
to
take
in
a
direct
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
held
for
that
reason
the
post
conviction
remedy
of
coram
nobus
was
not
open
to
him
under
state
law
and
i
read
this
as
saying
no
more
and
for
our
failure
to
request
the
change
the
venue,
your
2255
counterpart
was
not
open
to
him
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
in
either
case
the
answer
is
that
the
proper
forum
for
your
client
is
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
is
your
practice
mr.
kanner,
this
is
assignments
of
error
and
it
begins
defendant
assigns
the
following
errors
in
this
cause.
now
aren't
you
acquired
under
your
practice
the
list
all
of
the
assignments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
are
the
only
ones
you
listed
and
not
one
of
them
that
includes
a
denial
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
point
of
alleged
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
is
this
not
one
of
them,
says
anything
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
it
certainly
does
but
it
--
my
difficulty
is,
you
don't
seem
whatever
the
reason
may
have
been
perhaps
your
practice
permits
it,
but
surely
you
didn't
assign
that
as
one
of
the
errors
in
the
denial
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
when
you
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
determines
life
and
death
under
the
florida
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
on
some
assurance
if
they
don't
give
a
life
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
william
j.

errors
in
this
cause.
now
aren't
you
acquired
under
your
practice
the
list
all
of
the
assignments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
are
the
only
ones
you
listed
and
not
one
of
them
that
includes
a
denial
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
point
of
alleged
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
is
this
not
one
of
them,
says
anything
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
it
certainly
does
but
it
--
my
difficulty
is,
you
don't
seem
whatever
the
reason
may
have
been
perhaps
your
practice
permits
it,
but
surely
you
didn't
assign
that
as
one
of
the
errors
in
the
denial
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
when
you
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you?
