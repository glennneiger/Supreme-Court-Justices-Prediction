mr.
james
t.
carlisle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
no
desire
to
argue
my
friend's
case
for
him
and
--
but
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
and
i
feel
were
not
adequately
answered
by
the
petitioner.
there
were
some
other
issues
as
to
the
fact
which
and
by
the
way
they
were
accurately
stated
to
you,
but
there
are
just
a
few
things
i
want
to
make
clear
about
the
facts.
now
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position
it
is
simply
this.
he
alleges
in
the
rule
1
petition,
that's
our
2255
or
your
2255
we
call
it
rule
1,
he
alleged
in
his
motion
for
collateral
attack,
his
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
sentence
that
he
was
denied
or
that
there
was
this
pervasive
pretrial
publicity
including,
and
it
says
tape
recorded
confessions
of
the
defendant,
which
were
broadcast
over
local
television
stations
and
local
radio
stations.
now
i
don't
think
we
have
a
rideau
situation
if
we
base
or
bottom
our
thinking
solely
upon
the
allegation
as
made
in
the
rule
1
petition.
he
does
not
allege
there
was
a
picture
appearing
on
the
television
screens
of
dennis
whitney
being
interrogated
by
the
sheriff.
i
think
the
allegation
is
simply
that
there
was
this
tape
recorded
confession,
which
was
played.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
judge
i
don't
know
whether--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
and
let
me
say
this,
there
is
a
very
little
of
the
original
file
record,
most
of
it
is
taken
by
the
voir
dire.
let
me
just
say
this.
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
television
broadcast.
my
position
is
like
on
any
other
--
the
respondent
on
any
2255
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
motion
for
collateral
relief
alleges
sufficiently
to
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing.
we
must
take
these
allegations
as
being
true
and
i
have
lived
in
florida
at
that
time
and
i
have
to--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
am
almost
a
native,
i
was
just
away
for
a
while.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
he
was
not
in
miami
at
that
time
i
believe
he
said
he
did
not
live
in
dade
county.
mr.
kanner
is
old
and
–
of
an
old
and
very
respective
legal
family
in
florida.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
because
you
don't
need
one.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let's,
let
me
i
guess
i
am
getting
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
i
am
glad
you
asked
the
question
because
it's
a
beautiful
time
to
answer
it.
let's
take
rideau.
supposedly
it
has
situation
just
like
rideau,
now
it's
my
position
that
even
if
we
had
a
rideau
situation
that
this
court
did
not
say
in
rideau
that
when
we
have
such
a
situation
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
bring
in
any
evidence
of
voir
dire.
we
are
just
going
to
automatically
assume
that
because
we
have
that
situation,
there
could
not
have
been
a
fair
trial.
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court
meant
to
say
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court
said.
i
think
rideau
and
irwin
and
sheppard
and
estes
and
all
of
these
cases
mean
simply
this.
that
when
you
have
a
situation,
a
pervasive
adverse
pretrial
publicity
that
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
show
that
no
prejudice
juror
got
into
that
jury
box.
i
say
that
by
the
way
this
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
is
all
of
the
voir
dire
relating
to
pretrial
publicity
of
every
person.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
we
had,
no
gerstein
is
our
state
attorney
in
dade
county
and
mr.
block
is
in
there
too
as,
also
an
assistant
state
attorney
at
the
time.
we
have
max
swan
who
was
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
judge
mitchell
goldman.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir
and
did
so,
i
say
and
if
you
read
the
appendix
did
so
with
vigor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no
i
--
it
is
of
course
my
argument
and
it
was
in
the
third
district
court
that
the
voir
dire
proves
that
this
was
a
fair
trial
at
least
as
far
as
the
jury,
the
composition
of
the
jury
--.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
right,
but
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
let
me
again
i
think
i
started
out
saying
i
didn't
want
to
argue
my
opponent's
case
and
yet
i
want
to
make
clear
what
i
think
his
position
is,
and
i
believe
i
can
do
this
i
only
got
far
of
it
out
and
i
began
to
answer
questions
and
i
am
not
deferring
your
question
i
am
going
to
answer
it
right
now.
his
second
allegation
is
that
he
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
counsel
failed
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
and
i
understand
from
oral
argument
now,
there
is
something
about
it
in
the
brief
that
i
never
really
understood
the
relevance
of
it,
and
i
didn't
respond
to
it,
but
that
he
failed
to
ask
for
instructions,
that
he
failed
to
use
the
psychiatric
testimony.
i
am
prepared
to
answer
these
questions.
so
i
think
that
we're
properly
before
this
court
and
i
always
want
to
say
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
court,
let's
have
that,
but
we
properly
here
because
counsel
has
very
clearly
coupled
the
one,
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
argument
to
the
competency
of
counsel
in
failing
to
do
something
about
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
in
the
trial
record
making
any
reference
to
it
is
the
voir
dire
and
these
are
states
that--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
alright.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
alright
your
honor
my
answer
is
that
it
was
not
a
denial
of
due
process
for
this
reason
that
assuming
as
we
must
in
the
posture
of
this
case
that
there
was
adverse
pretrial
publicity
that
nevertheless
the
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors
establishes
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
no
prejudiced
juror
was
seated
in
that
jury
box.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
there
is
no
legal
infirmity,
there
is
no
harmless
error.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
don't
like
it
when
you
say
there
was
no
harm
done
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
mr.
justice
my
position
is
simply
that
no
evidentiary
hearing
is
necessary
if,
i
assume
and
i
am
positive
that
in
florida
or
that
in
the
federal
courts
under
2255
a
motion
to
vacate
a
judgment
and
sentence
is
handled
the
same
way
it
is
in
florida.
the
trial
court
judge
reads
the
motion
and
he
determines
from
the
motion
that
the
ground
a,
b
and
c
are
frivolous,
but
ground
d,
if
true
would
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
at
this
point
the
judge
then
turns
to
the
record
and
i
might
add
this
judge
was
the
same
judge,
he
was
a
trial
court
judge,
he
then
turns
to
the
record
and
examines
this
and
if
ground
d
is
not
conclusively
refuted
by
the
record
then
he
must
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
i
suppose
that
i
could
very
accurately
i
hope
in
answer
to
your
question
by
saying
that
the
record
of
the
voir
dire
in
the
case
at
bar
conclusively
refutes
the
petitioner's
allegation
insofar
as
he
alleges
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial
by
reason
of
adverse
pretrial
publicity,
even
if
we
assume
that
its
all
true
as
he
say
it
is.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
know
we
asked
this
question
at
the
time
oswald
was
shot
by
ruby,
everybody
saw
it
many,
many
times.
now
is
it
possible
to
conduct
a
trial
in
under
such
circumstances?
we've
never
had
to
conduct
such
a
trial
under
such
circumstances.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
wouldn't
consider
me
unfair
if
i
said
no,
would
you
mr.
justice?[laughter]
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no
seriously
mr.
justice
i
don't
know
maybe,
you
know
i
said
i
have
always
been
a
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
know
and
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
know
and
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
think
that
--
i
have
always
been,
well
i
have
always
been
a
prosecutor
on
the
prosecution
side,
there
are
very
many
times
when
i
could
see
a
case,
a
defense
case
and
say
well
i'd
like
to
defend
the
case.
i
think
every
lawyer
feels
that
way,
i
want
to
go
to
trial
in
any
side.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
somebody
in
the
ruby
situation
could
not
have
been
defended
effectively
despite
the
fact
that
every
person
in
that
jury
box
saw
what
happened,
it
wasn't
free
from
doubt.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
he
killed
a
total
of
seven
people
he
shot
one
man
with
gun.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
mean
that
perhaps
these
jurors
saw
this.
well
i
can
only
refer
you
again
to
the
voir
dire.
it's
this,
perhaps
it's
the
size
of
city
of
miami,
the
transient
population,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
people
in
the
newspaper
business
or
the
news
media
business
who
read
this
are
dismayed
i
mean
we
might
go
rat
fishing
their
product
for
all
that
is
red.
the
jurors
had
only
a
cursory
knowledge
of
this
case.
some
of
them
in,
reading
between
the
line
i'd
say,
we
are
almost
totally
ignorant
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
maybe
this
speaks
for
our
crime
rate
that
perhaps
dennis
whitney
was
just
buried
i
don't
know,
but
the,
as
i
see
it
your
honor
we
cannot
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
yes
it's
probably
many
situations
in
which
television
rideau
i
believe
was
one
there
no
doubt
about
that
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
a
fair
trial
at
least
at
that
time.
but
in
rideau
there
was
no,
well
there
was
evidence
of
the
voir
dire
but
what
did
the
evidence
show.
now
we
admittedly
the
rule
is
that
it
does
not
happen
to
be
a
nexus,
i
believe
in
st's
and
so
on,
we
have,
we
have,
you
have,
you've
done
something
to
rideau.
now
you
say
that
rideau
holds
that,
there
didn't
have
to
be
any
nexus.
mr.
justice
clark
had
dissented
in
rideau
because
there
had
been
no
showing
of
a
nexus.
i
thought
when
i
read
rideau
that
there
was.
but
in
any
case
the
rule
now
appears
to
be
that
there
does
not
have
be
to
a
showing
between
the
community
prejudice
and
the
jury
prejudice.
as
i
see
it
your
honor
that
if
in
rideau
instead
of
eight
jurors
saying
well
i
have
reached
a
--
i
believe
this
is
the
facts,
eight
jurors
saying
i
have
formed
an
opinion
based
upon
what
i've
read,
heard
and
seen,
but
i'm
willing
to
listen
to
the
evidence
and
if
you
can
convince
me
that
he's
innocent,
i'll
vote
that
he's
innocent.
now,
that
was
what
rideau
had
to
face.
that's
not
what
dennis
whitney
had
to
face
and
again
i
refer
to
look
to
the
voir
dire
examination
in
the
record
and
for
your
convenience
as
the
appendix
of
this
brief.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
am
carlisle.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
i
hate
this
argument
by
adequate
state
grounds,
but
anyway
let's
go
into
it
a
moment.
perhaps
if
the
only
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
understand
that
your
honor,
but
if
the
only
contention
raised
by
the
petitioner
had
been
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
perhaps
the
holding
of
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
florida
that
failure
to
move
for
a
change
venue
and
failure
to
exhaust
the
peremptory
challenges
constitutes
a
waiver
or
an
adequate
state
ground.
if
that
were
the
only
allegation
that
were
made,
i
would
say
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
because
this
was
an
adequate
state
ground.
and
i
do
not
say
that
i
agreed
the
decision
of
the
the
district
court
of
appeals.
we
argued
want
more
to
the
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
if
in
fact
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
think
they
could
have
set
a
great
deal
more
and
i
would
like
to
state
it
here,
let
me
continue
to
answer
your
question
though,
as
i
say
that
if
the
only
allegation
had
been
this
pretrial
publicity
that
would
have
been
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
counsel
has
also
alleged
that
the
--
he
was
--
petitioner
has
alleged
that
he
was
denied
the
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
or
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
that
his
attorney
failed
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
failed
to
ask
for
these
instructions,
fail
to
use
the
psychiatric
witnesses
and
that
would
--
i
would
like
to
make
that
portion
of
my
--
that
portion
of
this
case,
that
issue,
the
second
portion
of
my
argument.
as
i
--
the
first
one
that
we
about
exhausted
i
believe
is
just
simply
this,
that
it
did
not
move
for
the
change
of
venue.
of
150
venire
men
he
only,
a
total
of
a
150,
the
state
and
the
defendant
only
examined
48.
of
a
total
of
10
peremptory
challenges
afforded
to
the
petitioner,
petitioner
only
exercise
seven.
now,
this
may
not
be
conclusive
but
when
you
couple
it
with
the
second
argument.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
my
second,
your
–
[laughter]
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
oh
yes
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i'm
not
so
sure
they
didn't
but
if
they
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
they
close
by
--
its
not
because
we
didn't
tell
them
either,
it's
--
they
closed
by
saying
that
the
quoting
from
the
record
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
which
mr.
whitney
took
to
the
florida
supreme
court
the
opinion
and
that
just
simply
says
the
record
is
to
devoid
of
any
evidence
that
petition's
counsel
failed
to
act
in
good
faith,
whether
they
--
it's
quoted
on
page
8,
and
9
on
my
brief,
i
don't
want
to
read
it
to
you,
at
any
rate
that's
the
only
mention
they
make
of
whether
counsel
was
confident
or
not.
they
bypassed
that
issue
so
to
speak,
unless
you
consider
that
a
holding
on
the
effectiveness
of
counsel.
the
second
argument
is
just
--
i
don't
know,
the
second
argument
is
just
simply
that
the
defense
--
the
defendant
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
his
attorney
after
being
told
or
requested
by
the
petitioner
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
he
didn't
do
it.
and
now
we
hear
on
oral
argument
that
after
being
--
that
he
failed
to
ask
for
cautionary
instruction
as
to
the
pretrial
publicity
and
that
he
failed
to
use
the
psychiatric
witnesses.
the
petitioner
tries
to
draw
a
line
between
pretrial
strategy
and
trial
strategy.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
this
line
can
be
drawn.
certainly
we
recognize
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
ultimately
up
to
the
defendant,
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
take
an
appeal
is
ultimately
up
to
the
defendant,
but
when
you
get
into
questions
like
whether
to
move
to
quash
an
indictment
or
an
information,
whether
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
these
questions
i
submit
are
part
of
the
trial
strategy
even
though
the
motion
might
very
well
be
made
long
prior
to
trial.
now
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
what
they
allege.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
as
far
as
the
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
and
that's
really
the
only
point
where
we
get
to
ask
the
attorneys
and
happened,
there's
no
evidence
about
it,
it
was
not
an
issue
at
that
time
and
we
must
take
as
true.
we
must
take
it
as
true
the
fact
that
he
asked
his
attorney
to
move
for
a
change
venue
and
that
his
attorney
failed
to
do
so.
i
say
that
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
is,
although
it
might
be
filed
long
prior
to
trial,
is
part
of
the
trial
strategy
and
for
this
reason
because
the
most
appropriate
time
absent
a
sheppard
situation
for
instance,
the
most
appropriate
time
for
the
trial
court
judge
to
make
his
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
grant
this
motion
is
during
or
after
voir
dire
when
he
confined
well
this
fellow
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
fair
jury.
this
area
is
so
permeated
and
everybody
knows
about
it
and
every
jurors
that's
been
up
here
has
got
some
sort
of
an
opinion,
i'm
going
to
grant
his
motion,
but
by
the
same
token
a
lawyer
who
had
filed
such
a
motion
could
very
well
find
himself
with
a
jury
or
with
a
panel
of
persons
in
the
jury
box
which
he
could
accept
which
he
feels
is
the
best
possible
jury
that
he
can
get
and
in
which
case
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
him
to
withdraw
his
motion
or
at
least
not
raise
it
again.
so
i
think
very
well
that's
what
happened
in
the
case
of
beck.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
giving
you
a
perfect
answer.
i
think
it
was
six
months,
it
was
less
than
the
time
in
beck,
beck
i
believe
was
nine
months
beck
versus
washington.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
we
don't
know
when
it
was
broadcast.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
we
don't.
but
as
i
--
again
as
i
say
when
you
read
the
voir
dire,
there's
no
necessity
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
if
you
wanted
to
reverse
this
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
say
that
voir
dire
is
no
longer
a
useful
tool
and
while
you
might
as
well
then
go
on
and
say
that
that
sworn
testimony
in
court
is
no
longer
useful
tool
in
determining
truth.
because
if
jurors
lie
and
they're
under
an
oath,
if
they
lie
when
they
go
into
the
jury
box
and
i
am
sure
that
they
do
just
as
witnesses
do.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
unless
of
course
we
could
prove
the
statements
were
not
manky.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
specter
does
present
itself
but
i
would
say
there
are
two
--
as
a
prosecutor
now
there
are
two
ways
you
find
such
a
motion,
when
the
allegation
is
made
you
find
–
you
gather
up
all
of
the
publicity
and
say
this
is
all
there
was
although
the
burdens
fall
on
me.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
right,
this
--
such
an
allegation
it
would
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
don't
know
about
constitutionally
speaking.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
if
i
understand
you
your
honor
i
believe
you
are
saying
that
from
this
time
on
anyone
who
came
forward
in
a
2255
motion
or
anybody
who
came
in
a
florida
rule
1
motion
and
alleged
that
there
was
this
adverse
pretrial
publicity
a
la
rideau,
but
right
then
we
would
have
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
you
are
right.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
are
right.
now
i
just
don't
think
that
a
trial
lawyer
is
required
to
do
what
a
17-year
old
boy
tells
him
to
do.
if
he
is
required
to
do
this,
he
is
nothing
more
than
a
mouth
piece.
17-year
old
boy
says
get
up
and
object
to
that
evidence,
yes
sir,
i
object
your
honor.
sit
down
and
don't
talk
so
long
now,
okay
and
this
is
not
the
way
i
am
ever
going
to
try
a
case
and
i
don't
think
any
other
confident
lawyer
would
do
it.
now
counsel
has
mentioned
powell
versus
alabama,
gideon
versus
wainwright,
you
convinced
the
people
of
state
of
florida
of
the
necessity
of
counsel.
certainly
we
now
recognize
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
in
all
aspects
of
his
trial.
now
how
are
you
going
to
give
this
man
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
every
time
the
defendant
wants
the
attorney
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
wants
the
attorney
to
request
particular
instructions,
wants
him
to
object
to
certain
evidence,
wants
him
to
use
certain
witnesses.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
that
is
his
point
and
i'd
say
to
you
that
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
i
don't
say
that,
i
say
that
even
if
the
publicity
was
as
bad
as
rideau,
if
in
rideau
you
are
able
to
show
from
the
voir
dire
examination
that
no
prejudice
juror
found
his
way
into
that
jury
box,
you
would
not
have
reversed
and
that
all
of
these
decisions
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
i
believe
you
and
mr.
justice
clark
dissented
in
that.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
what
the
court
said
your
honor
but
my
reading
of
rideau
is
simply
that
i
saw
when
i
read
it
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
the
publicity
and
between
the
trial.
now
you
and
mr.
justice
clark
have
decided
because
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
you
dissented
because
you
said
that
there
had
been
no
nexus
shown.
i
respectfully
disagreed
with
you
even
though
you
were
favoring
the
prosecution
in
the
case.
now
i
say
that
the
rule
is
now,
despite
the
facts
of
the
rule
is
now
that
there
need
be
no
nexus
shown
between
the
community
prejudice
and
the
jury
prejudice
that
if
that
at
this
time
that
once
you
to
show
sufficient
prejudice
to,
sufficient
adverse
pretrial
publicity
to
show
the
possibility
of
that
type
of
community
prejudice,
that
then
it
becomes
duty
of
the
state
to
show
by
some
means
preferably
by
the
voir
dire
as
was
done
in
this
case
that
no
prejudice
jurors
found
the
way
into
the
jury
box.
now
as
far
as
i
don't
know
i
can't
get
inside
of
defense
counsel's
mind
at
the
time
they
tried
this
case
and
i
wonder
if
an
evidentiary
hearing
will
be
of
any
value.
it
would
certainly
put
them
in
a
strange
position
where
they
would,
if
they
get
on
the
stand
and
they
say,
my
reasons
for
doing
what
i
did
were
good
reasons
then
he
is
hurting
his
former
client.
if
he
says
my
reasons,
i
did
what
i
did
were
because
i'm
not
a
very
good
lawyer,
i
just
can't
conceive
of
any
lawyer
wanting
to
do
this
and
any
lawyer
who
realized
that
he
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
this
type
of
thing
in
the
future
would
ever
take
an
appointment
in
a
criminal
case.
i
for
one
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
would
not
as
to
this
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
but
not
as
to
--
their
reasons
for
not
using
psychiatric
witness.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let
me
say
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let
me
make
the
point
too
that
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
testify
the
first
time
much
less
the
second
time.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
without
taking
great
deal
of
time
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
there,
i'll
leave
it
to
mr.
kanner
to
bring
it.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
it
is
but
your
honor
let
me
say
this
that
i
assure
you
that
mr.
kanner
argued
this
very
vigorously
before
the
third
district
court.
now,
if
the
third
district
did
things
the
way
i
would
like
them
to
do
it,
they
would
not
have
heard
this
point,
but
they
are
very
liberal
about
this.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
they
did
not
other
than
as
i
stated
before
they
quoted
something
from
the
supreme
court
opinion
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
but
that's
a
rather
tangential
holding
i
would
say.
now,
i
can
--
as
i
say
i
can't
get
inside
of
the
defense
counsel's
head
but
i
can
see
why
defense
counsel
would
not
have
put
on
the
psychiatric
testimony.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
psychiatric
testimony.
first
of
all,
i
believe
it
will
open
the
door
to
the
fact
this
man
had
killed
six
other
people
and
shot
another
one
who
happened
to
live
four
times
in
the
head,
look
at
page
23
of
the
record.
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
damming
to
have
in
evidence
and
that's
seems
to
me
a
very
good
reason
for
deciding
not
use
this
type
of
testimony.
i
don't
know
why
defense
counsel
did
not
request
a
certain
instruction,
i'm
not
even
sure
that
he
didn't
but
i
would
think
that
if
i
were
defense
counsel
that
i
might
not
want
the
jury
put
on
notice
again
that
there
had
been
all
this
pretrial
publicity
that
this
fellow
must
be
a
real
bad
guy,
i
just
wouldn't
want
it.
i
think
i
might
be
very
happy
to
go
trial
and
take
my
chances
on
the
court's
standard
instruction
as
to
evidence
heard
from
the
witness
stand.
and
again
back
to
the
change
of
venue,
i
think
that
counsel
after
being
requested
by
his
client,
this
defendant
to
move
for
a
change
venue
that
this
decision
was
up
to
defense
counsel
and
he
made
the
decision
at
some
time
during
the
voir
dire
examination.
i
think
it
is
apparent
from
the
voir
dire
examination
that
at
some
point
defense
counsel
decided
that,
you
know
this
looks
like
a
pretty
good
jury
to
me,
let's
go
to
trial,
let's
hear
it
on
the
issue.
and
as
i
say
i've
cited
nelson
as
being
the
controlling
case
on
this
issue,
i'd
like
to
--
they're
talking
about
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
to
whose
decision
is
as
to
make.
now
of
course
nelson
wanted
to
object
to
allegedly
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
the
court
held,
well
this
was
the
decision
for
counsel
not
the
defendant
to
make.
and
that
counsel's
decision
is
binding
on
the
defendant
except
for
in
unusual
circumstances
which
they
feel
is
fine
and
so
the
court
says
now
this
is
the
same
situation
as
whitney
had.
nelson
had
asked
his
defense
counsel
object
to
that
testimony,
object
to
this
evidence
and
the
counsel
refused
to
do
it.
and
so
the
court
then
says
does
the
fact
here
that
there
was
prior
consultation
with
the
accused
and
that
he
disagreed
with
counsel's
strategy
make
a
legal
difference.
the
question
is
not
in
before
the
supreme
court.
our
view
is
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
meaning
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference.
so
i
submit
gentlemen
that
the
issue
of
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
is
controlled
is
by
the
voir
dire
examination
and
that
these
decision
–
decisions
be
made
solely
by
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
no
desire
to
argue
my
friend's
case
for
him
and
--
but
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
and
i
feel
were
not
adequately
answered
by
the
petitioner.
there
were
some
other
issues
as
to
the
fact
which
and
by
the
way
they
were
accurately
stated
to
you,
but
there
are
just
a
few
things
i
want
to
make
clear
about
the
facts.
now
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position
it
is
simply
this.
he
alleges
in
the
rule
1
petition,
that's
our
2255
or
your
2255
we
call
it
rule
1,
he
alleged
in
his
motion
for
collateral
attack,
his
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
sentence
that
he
was
denied
or
that
there
was
this
pervasive
pretrial
publicity
including,
and
it
says
tape
recorded
confessions
of
the
defendant,
which
were
broadcast
over
local
television
stations
and
local
radio
stations.
now
i
don't
think
we
have
a
rideau
situation
if
we
base
or
bottom
our
thinking
solely
upon
the
allegation
as
made
in
the
rule
1
petition.
he
does
not
allege
there
was
a
picture
appearing
on
the
television
screens
of
dennis
whitney
being
interrogated
by
the
sheriff.
i
think
the
allegation
is
simply
that
there
was
this
tape
recorded
confession,
which
was
played.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
judge
i
don't
know
whether--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
and
let
me
say
this,
there
is
a
very
little
of
the
original
file
record,
most
of
it
is
taken
by
the
voir
dire.
let
me
just
say
this.
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
television
broadcast.
my
position
is
like
on
any
other
--
the
respondent
on
any
2255
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
motion
for
collateral
relief
alleges
sufficiently
to
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing.
we
must
take
these
allegations
as
being
true
and
i
have
lived
in
florida
at
that
time
and
i
have
to--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
am
almost
a
native,
i
was
just
away
for
a
while.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
he
was
not
in
miami
at
that
time
i
believe
he
said
he
did
not
live
in
dade
county.
mr.
kanner
is
old
and
–
of
an
old
and
very
respective
legal
family
in
florida.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
because
you
don't
need
one.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let's,
let
me
i
guess
i
am
getting
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
i
am
glad
you
asked
the
question
because
it's
a
beautiful
time
to
answer
it.
let's
take
rideau.
supposedly
it
has
situation
just
like
rideau,
now
it's
my
position
that
even
if
we
had
a
rideau
situation
that
this
court
did
not
say
in
rideau
that
when
we
have
such
a
situation
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
bring
in
any
evidence
of
voir
dire.
we
are
just
going
to
automatically
assume
that
because
we
have
that
situation,
there
could
not
have
been
a
fair
trial.
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court
meant
to
say
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court
said.
i
think
rideau
and
irwin
and
sheppard
and
estes
and
all
of
these
cases
mean
simply
this.
that
when
you
have
a
situation,
a
pervasive
adverse
pretrial
publicity
that
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
show
that
no
prejudice
juror
got
into
that
jury
box.
i
say
that
by
the
way
this
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
is
all
of
the
voir
dire
relating
to
pretrial
publicity
of
every
person.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
we
had,
no
gerstein
is
our
state
attorney
in
dade
county
and
mr.
block
is
in
there
too
as,
also
an
assistant
state
attorney
at
the
time.
we
have
max
swan
who
was
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
judge
mitchell
goldman.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir
and
did
so,
i
say
and
if
you
read
the
appendix
did
so
with
vigor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no
i
--
it
is
of
course
my
argument
and
it
was
in
the
third
district
court
that
the
voir
dire
proves
that
this
was
a
fair
trial
at
least
as
far
as
the
jury,
the
composition
of
the
jury
--.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
right,
but
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
let
me
again
i
think
i
started
out
saying
i
didn't
want
to
argue
my
opponent's
case
and
yet
i
want
to
make
clear
what
i
think
his
position
is,
and
i
believe
i
can
do
this
i
only
got
far
of
it
out
and
i
began
to
answer
questions
and
i
am
not
deferring
your
question
i
am
going
to
answer
it
right
now.
his
second
allegation
is
that
he
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
counsel
failed
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
and
i
understand
from
oral
argument
now,
there
is
something
about
it
in
the
brief
that
i
never
really
understood
the
relevance
of
it,
and
i
didn't
respond
to
it,
but
that
he
failed
to
ask
for
instructions,
that
he
failed
to
use
the
psychiatric
testimony.
i
am
prepared
to
answer
these
questions.
so
i
think
that
we're
properly
before
this
court
and
i
always
want
to
say
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
court,
let's
have
that,
but
we
properly
here
because
counsel
has
very
clearly
coupled
the
one,
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
argument
to
the
competency
of
counsel
in
failing
to
do
something
about
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
in
the
trial
record
making
any
reference
to
it
is
the
voir
dire
and
these
are
states
that--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
alright.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
alright
your
honor
my
answer
is
that
it
was
not
a
denial
of
due
process
for
this
reason
that
assuming
as
we
must
in
the
posture
of
this
case
that
there
was
adverse
pretrial
publicity
that
nevertheless
the
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors
establishes
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
no
prejudiced
juror
was
seated
in
that
jury
box.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
there
is
no
legal
infirmity,
there
is
no
harmless
error.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
don't
like
it
when
you
say
there
was
no
harm
done
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
mr.
justice
my
position
is
simply
that
no
evidentiary
hearing
is
necessary
if,
i
assume
and
i
am
positive
that
in
florida
or
that
in
the
federal
courts
under
2255
a
motion
to
vacate
a
judgment
and
sentence
is
handled
the
same
way
it
is
in
florida.
the
trial
court
judge
reads
the
motion
and
he
determines
from
the
motion
that
the
ground
a,
b
and
c
are
frivolous,
but
ground
d,
if
true
would
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
at
this
point
the
judge
then
turns
to
the
record
and
i
might
add
this
judge
was
the
same
judge,
he
was
a
trial
court
judge,
he
then
turns
to
the
record
and
examines
this
and
if
ground
d
is
not
conclusively
refuted
by
the
record
then
he
must
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
i
suppose
that
i
could
very
accurately
i
hope
in
answer
to
your
question
by
saying
that
the
record
of
the
voir
dire
in
the
case
at
bar
conclusively
refutes
the
petitioner's
allegation
insofar
as
he
alleges
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial
by
reason
of
adverse
pretrial
publicity,
even
if
we
assume
that
its
all
true
as
he
say
it
is.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
know
we
asked
this
question
at
the
time
oswald
was
shot
by
ruby,
everybody
saw
it
many,
many
times.
now
is
it
possible
to
conduct
a
trial
in
under
such
circumstances?
we've
never
had
to
conduct
such
a
trial
under
such
circumstances.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
wouldn't
consider
me
unfair
if
i
said
no,
would
you
mr.
justice?[laughter]
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no
seriously
mr.
justice
i
don't
know
maybe,
you
know
i
said
i
have
always
been
a
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
know
and
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
know
and
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
think
that
--
i
have
always
been,
well
i
have
always
been
a
prosecutor
on
the
prosecution
side,
there
are
very
many
times
when
i
could
see
a
case,
a
defense
case
and
say
well
i'd
like
to
defend
the
case.
i
think
every
lawyer
feels
that
way,
i
want
to
go
to
trial
in
any
side.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
somebody
in
the
ruby
situation
could
not
have
been
defended
effectively
despite
the
fact
that
every
person
in
that
jury
box
saw
what
happened,
it
wasn't
free
from
doubt.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
he
killed
a
total
of
seven
people
he
shot
one
man
with
gun.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
mean
that
perhaps
these
jurors
saw
this.
well
i
can
only
refer
you
again
to
the
voir
dire.
it's
this,
perhaps
it's
the
size
of
city
of
miami,
the
transient
population,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
people
in
the
newspaper
business
or
the
news
media
business
who
read
this
are
dismayed
i
mean
we
might
go
rat
fishing
their
product
for
all
that
is
red.
the
jurors
had
only
a
cursory
knowledge
of
this
case.
some
of
them
in,
reading
between
the
line
i'd
say,
we
are
almost
totally
ignorant
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
maybe
this
speaks
for
our
crime
rate
that
perhaps
dennis
whitney
was
just
buried
i
don't
know,
but
the,
as
i
see
it
your
honor
we
cannot
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
yes
it's
probably
many
situations
in
which
television
rideau
i
believe
was
one
there
no
doubt
about
that
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
a
fair
trial
at
least
at
that
time.
but
in
rideau
there
was
no,
well
there
was
evidence
of
the
voir
dire
but
what
did
the
evidence
show.
now
we
admittedly
the
rule
is
that
it
does
not
happen
to
be
a
nexus,
i
believe
in
st's
and
so
on,
we
have,
we
have,
you
have,
you've
done
something
to
rideau.
now
you
say
that
rideau
holds
that,
there
didn't
have
to
be
any
nexus.
mr.
justice
clark
had
dissented
in
rideau
because
there
had
been
no
showing
of
a
nexus.
i
thought
when
i
read
rideau
that
there
was.
but
in
any
case
the
rule
now
appears
to
be
that
there
does
not
have
be
to
a
showing
between
the
community
prejudice
and
the
jury
prejudice.
as
i
see
it
your
honor
that
if
in
rideau
instead
of
eight
jurors
saying
well
i
have
reached
a
--
i
believe
this
is
the
facts,
eight
jurors
saying
i
have
formed
an
opinion
based
upon
what
i've
read,
heard
and
seen,
but
i'm
willing
to
listen
to
the
evidence
and
if
you
can
convince
me
that
he's
innocent,
i'll
vote
that
he's
innocent.
now,
that
was
what
rideau
had
to
face.
that's
not
what
dennis
whitney
had
to
face
and
again
i
refer
to
look
to
the
voir
dire
examination
in
the
record
and
for
your
convenience
as
the
appendix
of
this
brief.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
am
carlisle.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
i
hate
this
argument
by
adequate
state
grounds,
but
anyway
let's
go
into
it
a
moment.
perhaps
if
the
only
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
understand
that
your
honor,
but
if
the
only
contention
raised
by
the
petitioner
had
been
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
perhaps
the
holding
of
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
florida
that
failure
to
move
for
a
change
venue
and
failure
to
exhaust
the
peremptory
challenges
constitutes
a
waiver
or
an
adequate
state
ground.
if
that
were
the
only
allegation
that
were
made,
i
would
say
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
because
this
was
an
adequate
state
ground.
and
i
do
not
say
that
i
agreed
the
decision
of
the
the
district
court
of
appeals.
we
argued
want
more
to
the
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
if
in
fact
–
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
think
they
could
have
set
a
great
deal
more
and
i
would
like
to
state
it
here,
let
me
continue
to
answer
your
question
though,
as
i
say
that
if
the
only
allegation
had
been
this
pretrial
publicity
that
would
have
been
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
counsel
has
also
alleged
that
the
--
he
was
--
petitioner
has
alleged
that
he
was
denied
the
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
or
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
that
his
attorney
failed
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
failed
to
ask
for
these
instructions,
fail
to
use
the
psychiatric
witnesses
and
that
would
--
i
would
like
to
make
that
portion
of
my
--
that
portion
of
this
case,
that
issue,
the
second
portion
of
my
argument.
as
i
--
the
first
one
that
we
about
exhausted
i
believe
is
just
simply
this,
that
it
did
not
move
for
the
change
of
venue.
of
150
venire
men
he
only,
a
total
of
a
150,
the
state
and
the
defendant
only
examined
48.
of
a
total
of
10
peremptory
challenges
afforded
to
the
petitioner,
petitioner
only
exercise
seven.
now,
this
may
not
be
conclusive
but
when
you
couple
it
with
the
second
argument.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
my
second,
your
–
[laughter]
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
oh
yes
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i'm
not
so
sure
they
didn't
but
if
they
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
they
close
by
--
its
not
because
we
didn't
tell
them
either,
it's
--
they
closed
by
saying
that
the
quoting
from
the
record
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
which
mr.
whitney
took
to
the
florida
supreme
court
the
opinion
and
that
just
simply
says
the
record
is
to
devoid
of
any
evidence
that
petition's
counsel
failed
to
act
in
good
faith,
whether
they
--
it's
quoted
on
page
8,
and
9
on
my
brief,
i
don't
want
to
read
it
to
you,
at
any
rate
that's
the
only
mention
they
make
of
whether
counsel
was
confident
or
not.
they
bypassed
that
issue
so
to
speak,
unless
you
consider
that
a
holding
on
the
effectiveness
of
counsel.
the
second
argument
is
just
--
i
don't
know,
the
second
argument
is
just
simply
that
the
defense
--
the
defendant
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
his
attorney
after
being
told
or
requested
by
the
petitioner
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue
he
didn't
do
it.
and
now
we
hear
on
oral
argument
that
after
being
--
that
he
failed
to
ask
for
cautionary
instruction
as
to
the
pretrial
publicity
and
that
he
failed
to
use
the
psychiatric
witnesses.
the
petitioner
tries
to
draw
a
line
between
pretrial
strategy
and
trial
strategy.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
this
line
can
be
drawn.
certainly
we
recognize
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
ultimately
up
to
the
defendant,
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
take
an
appeal
is
ultimately
up
to
the
defendant,
but
when
you
get
into
questions
like
whether
to
move
to
quash
an
indictment
or
an
information,
whether
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
these
questions
i
submit
are
part
of
the
trial
strategy
even
though
the
motion
might
very
well
be
made
long
prior
to
trial.
now
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
what
they
allege.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
as
far
as
the
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
and
that's
really
the
only
point
where
we
get
to
ask
the
attorneys
and
happened,
there's
no
evidence
about
it,
it
was
not
an
issue
at
that
time
and
we
must
take
as
true.
we
must
take
it
as
true
the
fact
that
he
asked
his
attorney
to
move
for
a
change
venue
and
that
his
attorney
failed
to
do
so.
i
say
that
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
is,
although
it
might
be
filed
long
prior
to
trial,
is
part
of
the
trial
strategy
and
for
this
reason
because
the
most
appropriate
time
absent
a
sheppard
situation
for
instance,
the
most
appropriate
time
for
the
trial
court
judge
to
make
his
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
grant
this
motion
is
during
or
after
voir
dire
when
he
confined
well
this
fellow
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
fair
jury.
this
area
is
so
permeated
and
everybody
knows
about
it
and
every
jurors
that's
been
up
here
has
got
some
sort
of
an
opinion,
i'm
going
to
grant
his
motion,
but
by
the
same
token
a
lawyer
who
had
filed
such
a
motion
could
very
well
find
himself
with
a
jury
or
with
a
panel
of
persons
in
the
jury
box
which
he
could
accept
which
he
feels
is
the
best
possible
jury
that
he
can
get
and
in
which
case
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
him
to
withdraw
his
motion
or
at
least
not
raise
it
again.
so
i
think
very
well
that's
what
happened
in
the
case
of
beck.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
giving
you
a
perfect
answer.
i
think
it
was
six
months,
it
was
less
than
the
time
in
beck,
beck
i
believe
was
nine
months
beck
versus
washington.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
we
don't
know
when
it
was
broadcast.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
we
don't.
but
as
i
--
again
as
i
say
when
you
read
the
voir
dire,
there's
no
necessity
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
if
you
wanted
to
reverse
this
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
say
that
voir
dire
is
no
longer
a
useful
tool
and
while
you
might
as
well
then
go
on
and
say
that
that
sworn
testimony
in
court
is
no
longer
useful
tool
in
determining
truth.
because
if
jurors
lie
and
they're
under
an
oath,
if
they
lie
when
they
go
into
the
jury
box
and
i
am
sure
that
they
do
just
as
witnesses
do.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
unless
of
course
we
could
prove
the
statements
were
not
manky.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that
specter
does
present
itself
but
i
would
say
there
are
two
--
as
a
prosecutor
now
there
are
two
ways
you
find
such
a
motion,
when
the
allegation
is
made
you
find
–
you
gather
up
all
of
the
publicity
and
say
this
is
all
there
was
although
the
burdens
fall
on
me.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
that's
right,
this
--
such
an
allegation
it
would
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
i
don't
know
about
constitutionally
speaking.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
if
i
understand
you
your
honor
i
believe
you
are
saying
that
from
this
time
on
anyone
who
came
forward
in
a
2255
motion
or
anybody
who
came
in
a
florida
rule
1
motion
and
alleged
that
there
was
this
adverse
pretrial
publicity
a
la
rideau,
but
right
then
we
would
have
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
you
are
right.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
you
are
right.
now
i
just
don't
think
that
a
trial
lawyer
is
required
to
do
what
a
17-year
old
boy
tells
him
to
do.
if
he
is
required
to
do
this,
he
is
nothing
more
than
a
mouth
piece.
17-year
old
boy
says
get
up
and
object
to
that
evidence,
yes
sir,
i
object
your
honor.
sit
down
and
don't
talk
so
long
now,
okay
and
this
is
not
the
way
i
am
ever
going
to
try
a
case
and
i
don't
think
any
other
confident
lawyer
would
do
it.
now
counsel
has
mentioned
powell
versus
alabama,
gideon
versus
wainwright,
you
convinced
the
people
of
state
of
florida
of
the
necessity
of
counsel.
certainly
we
now
recognize
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
in
all
aspects
of
his
trial.
now
how
are
you
going
to
give
this
man
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
every
time
the
defendant
wants
the
attorney
to
move
for
a
change
of
venue,
wants
the
attorney
to
request
particular
instructions,
wants
him
to
object
to
certain
evidence,
wants
him
to
use
certain
witnesses.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
that
is
his
point
and
i'd
say
to
you
that
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
i
don't
say
that,
i
say
that
even
if
the
publicity
was
as
bad
as
rideau,
if
in
rideau
you
are
able
to
show
from
the
voir
dire
examination
that
no
prejudice
juror
found
his
way
into
that
jury
box,
you
would
not
have
reversed
and
that
all
of
these
decisions
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
i
believe
you
and
mr.
justice
clark
dissented
in
that.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
what
the
court
said
your
honor
but
my
reading
of
rideau
is
simply
that
i
saw
when
i
read
it
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
the
publicity
and
between
the
trial.
now
you
and
mr.
justice
clark
have
decided
because
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
you
dissented
because
you
said
that
there
had
been
no
nexus
shown.
i
respectfully
disagreed
with
you
even
though
you
were
favoring
the
prosecution
in
the
case.
now
i
say
that
the
rule
is
now,
despite
the
facts
of
the
rule
is
now
that
there
need
be
no
nexus
shown
between
the
community
prejudice
and
the
jury
prejudice
that
if
that
at
this
time
that
once
you
to
show
sufficient
prejudice
to,
sufficient
adverse
pretrial
publicity
to
show
the
possibility
of
that
type
of
community
prejudice,
that
then
it
becomes
duty
of
the
state
to
show
by
some
means
preferably
by
the
voir
dire
as
was
done
in
this
case
that
no
prejudice
jurors
found
the
way
into
the
jury
box.
now
as
far
as
i
don't
know
i
can't
get
inside
of
defense
counsel's
mind
at
the
time
they
tried
this
case
and
i
wonder
if
an
evidentiary
hearing
will
be
of
any
value.
it
would
certainly
put
them
in
a
strange
position
where
they
would,
if
they
get
on
the
stand
and
they
say,
my
reasons
for
doing
what
i
did
were
good
reasons
then
he
is
hurting
his
former
client.
if
he
says
my
reasons,
i
did
what
i
did
were
because
i'm
not
a
very
good
lawyer,
i
just
can't
conceive
of
any
lawyer
wanting
to
do
this
and
any
lawyer
who
realized
that
he
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
this
type
of
thing
in
the
future
would
ever
take
an
appointment
in
a
criminal
case.
i
for
one
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
would
not
as
to
this
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
but
not
as
to
--
their
reasons
for
not
using
psychiatric
witness.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let
me
say
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
well,
let
me
make
the
point
too
that
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
testify
the
first
time
much
less
the
second
time.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
without
taking
great
deal
of
time
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
there,
i'll
leave
it
to
mr.
kanner
to
bring
it.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
your
honor
--
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
yes,
it
is
but
your
honor
let
me
say
this
that
i
assure
you
that
mr.
kanner
argued
this
very
vigorously
before
the
third
district
court.
now,
if
the
third
district
did
things
the
way
i
would
like
them
to
do
it,
they
would
not
have
heard
this
point,
but
they
are
very
liberal
about
this.
mr.
james
t.
carlisle
no,
they
did
not
other
than
as
i
stated
before
they
quoted
something
from
the
supreme
court
opinion
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
but
that's
a
rather
tangential
holding
i
would
say.
now,
i
can
--
as
i
say
i
can't
get
inside
of
the
defense
counsel's
head
but
i
can
see
why
defense
counsel
would
not
have
put
on
the
psychiatric
testimony.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
psychiatric
testimony.
first
of
all,
i
believe
it
will
open
the
door
to
the
fact
this
man
had
killed
six
other
people
and
shot
another
one
who
happened
to
live
four
times
in
the
head,
look
at
page
23
of
the
record.
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
damming
to
have
in
evidence
and
that's
seems
to
me
a
very
good
reason
for
deciding
not
use
this
type
of
testimony.
i
don't
know
why
defense
counsel
did
not
request
a
certain
instruction,
i'm
not
even
sure
that
he
didn't
but
i
would
think
that
if
i
were
defense
counsel
that
i
might
not
want
the
jury
put
on
notice
again
that
there
had
been
all
this
pretrial
publicity
that
this
fellow
must
be
a
real
bad
guy,
i
just
wouldn't
want
it.
i
think
i
might
be
very
happy
to
go
trial
and
take
my
chances
on
the
court's
standard
instruction
as
to
evidence
heard
from
the
witness
stand.
and
again
back
to
the
change
of
venue,
i
think
that
counsel
after
being
requested
by
his
client,
this
defendant
to
move
for
a
change
venue
that
this
decision
was
up
to
defense
counsel
and
he
made
the
decision
at
some
time
during
the
voir
dire
examination.
i
think
it
is
apparent
from
the
voir
dire
examination
that
at
some
point
defense
counsel
decided
that,
you
know
this
looks
like
a
pretty
good
jury
to
me,
let's
go
to
trial,
let's
hear
it
on
the
issue.
and
as
i
say
i've
cited
nelson
as
being
the
controlling
case
on
this
issue,
i'd
like
to
--
they're
talking
about
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
to
whose
decision
is
as
to
make.
now
of
course
nelson
wanted
to
object
to
allegedly
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
the
court
held,
well
this
was
the
decision
for
counsel
not
the
defendant
to
make.
and
that
counsel's
decision
is
binding
on
the
defendant
except
for
in
unusual
circumstances
which
they
feel
is
fine
and
so
the
court
says
now
this
is
the
same
situation
as
whitney
had.
nelson
had
asked
his
defense
counsel
object
to
that
testimony,
object
to
this
evidence
and
the
counsel
refused
to
do
it.
and
so
the
court
then
says
does
the
fact
here
that
there
was
prior
consultation
with
the
accused
and
that
he
disagreed
with
counsel's
strategy
make
a
legal
difference.
the
question
is
not
in
before
the
supreme
court.
our
view
is
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
meaning
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference.
so
i
submit
gentlemen
that
the
issue
of
the
adverse
pretrial
publicity
is
controlled
is
by
the
voir
dire
examination
and
that
these
decision
–
decisions
be
made
solely
by
counsel.
thank
you.
