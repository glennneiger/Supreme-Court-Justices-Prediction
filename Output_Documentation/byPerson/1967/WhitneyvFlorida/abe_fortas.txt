justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir,
did
you
say
you
were
or
were
not
going
to
discuss
point
1c
in
your
brief
that
psychiatric
witness'
point.
justice
abe
fortas
because
that's
the
only
importance
here
attached
to
the
point
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
this?
is
there
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
taken
an
issue,
directed
the
way
you
want
this
one
directed
let
us
say
not
to
the
specific
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
to
the
recommendation
of
mercy?
do
you
know
any
such
case?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
mean
that,
but
i
mean
your
--
so
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
you
are
not
asking
us
to
reverse
because
of
error
in
the
judgment.
you
are
asking
us
to
reverse
because
you
think
that
there
was
error
committed
focused
to
crime
or
directed
to
the
jury's
failure
to
recommend
mercy.
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
have
we
already
done
that?
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
we
have
taken
such
action?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
not
say
you
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
you've
confused
the
court,
but
you
baffle
me,
because
i
don't
understand
the
jurisdictional
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
material
and
basic
difference
between
the
questions
that
you
presented
to
this
court
in
your
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
questions
that
you
are
now
presenting.
i
have
the
petition
before
me.
now
it
was
signed
by
mr.
ripley,
the
petitioner.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
singed
on
the
left
by
you
and
those
questions
that
were
presented,
there
were
two
question
presented.
the
first
one
is,
is
it
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
state
to
deny
a
post
conviction
evidentiary
hearing
in
a
capital
case
when
the
petitioner's
alleged
extensive
publication
et
cetera,
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial
on
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
would
recommend
mercy.
and
the
second
question
is,
is
it
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
state
to
deny
a
post
conviction
evidentiary
hearing
under
the
circumstances
related
above
when
the
petitioner
has
alleged
that
he
would
question
his
court
counsel
to
seek
a
change
in
venue
that
they
refuse
to
do
so.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
read
your
brief
there's
a
pretty
wide
gulf
between
what
the
questions
as
you
stated
in
here
and
the
questions
in
your
petition?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
looking
at
your
brief,
it's
true
as
well
as
listening
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
ask
you
a
very
question
that
i
try
to
put
as
simply
and
directly
as
i
can.
i
don't
believe
you
finished
your
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question.
the
record,
the
trail
record
did
not
contain
a
description
or
evidence
with
respect
to
these
television
broadcast,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
alright
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
now
subsequently
collateral
proceedings
the
court
did
not
afford
the
defendant,
petitioner
here
an
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence
as
to
that
prejudice,
allegedly
prejudicial
publicity
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
question
is,
whether
the
petitioner
here
was
deprived
of
constitutional
right
by
reason
of
the
court's
refusal
in
collateral
proceeding
to
permit
him
to
present
evidence
with
respect
to
this
prejudicial
publicity.
i
don't
believe
that
received
much
attention
in
your
adversary's
argument.
justice
marshall
asked
you
a
question
along
those
lines.
i
now
repeat
the
question
in
this
form.
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the,
to
that
question,
was
it
or
was
it
not
constitutional
error
for
the
state
court
to
refuse
in
these
circumstances
where
a
man
faces
death
penalty
to
admit
evidence
of
the
–
this
allegedly
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
and
that
sets
a
legal
question
to
this
court
on
which
i'd
like
to
hear
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now
you
are
saying
that
if
this
was
error,
was
harmless
error,
i'm
not
sure
it
depends
on
the
legal
infirmity
here
if
there
is
a
legal
infirmity?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
point
to,
now
lets
see
your
position
on
that.
the
first
point
is
that
in
view
of
the
voir
dire
questions
there
was
no
harm
done,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
stated
it
your
way
but
give
me
a
complete
answer
to
that.
