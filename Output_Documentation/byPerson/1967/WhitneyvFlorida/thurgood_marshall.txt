justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
habeas
corpus
here,
there
was
testimony
that
the
recording
witness
is
going
to
be
used,
gory
colored
pictures
of
the
crime
scene
were
going
to
be
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
his
testimony
to
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
signed
the
testimony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
it
addressed
one
of
these
lawyers
and
judge,
is
he
a
former
judges
or
he
just
carries
the
tag
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
true
that
he
did
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
--
probably
all
of
his
testimony
amount
to
a
plea
of
mercy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn't
precluded
from
putting
all
evidence,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kanner
on
the
asking
for
the
change
of
venue,
i
would
assume
there's
a
difference
between
a
defendant
suggesting
to
his
lawyer
that
he
ask
for
a
change
of
venue,
a
defendant
instructing
his
lawyer
to
ask
for
a
change
of
venue
and
a
defendant
insisting
that
you
either
ask
for
a
change
of
venue
or
get
out.
which
took
place
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that's
enough
to
sustain
your
point
that
he
requested
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
assume
that
the
information
that
you
used
to
make
that
statement
was
that
--
all
he
did
was
the
request.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
failure
to
do
it
is
denial
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carlisle.
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
here
in
this
courtroom
knows
as
of
now
what
was
shown
over
television.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
should
we
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
find
that.
what
is
your
objection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carlisle,
can
you
conceive
of
one
or
more
television
performances
that
would
make
it
on
its
face
impossible
to
hold
a
trial
in
that
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
agree
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
such
a
television
show?
i
am
going
to
be
probably
fair
with
you
if
you
say
yes,
i
am
going
to
say
why
can't
see
what's
here,
we
were
fair
that's
where
i
am
going?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
those
circumstances
i
would
not?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
remember
you
said
a
minute
ago
once
we
are
here,
let's
sort
it
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
were
there
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
a
chance
to
putting
on
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
then
you
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
carlisle
in
this
according
to
the
allegations
he
not
only
confessed
to
this
one,
but
he
confessed
to,
i've
lost
count
of
them,
how
many
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
be
material
to
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
mercy,
not
guilty
or
anything
but
mercy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
contrary,
i
understand
petitioner's
point,
one
that
this
publicity
was
so
violent
and
so
horrible
and
so
everything
else.
two,
that
whether
or
not
requested,
a
good
lawyer
should
have
asked
for
change
of
venue,
isn't
that
really
what
his
point
is,
with
or
without
the
request?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
depends
on
how
bad
the
publicity
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
two
lawyers
have
already
testified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
testified
the
habeas
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
testified
that
they
did
a
good
job,
they
realized
that
that
was
one
of
the
charges
against
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
raise
the
point
about
they
wouldn't
want
to
testify,
they've
already
testified
once.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
testified
once,
it
wouldn't
hurt
to
testify
again,
that's
not
the
point?
