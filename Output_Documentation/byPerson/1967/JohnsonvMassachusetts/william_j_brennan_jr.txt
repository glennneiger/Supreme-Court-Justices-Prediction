justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
how
long
after
he
was
booked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meanwhile,
the
medical
attention
he
received,
you
say
first
aid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
time
was
this
first
conversation,
that
was
around
midnight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
and
when
did
he
--
these
lineups?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
final
statement
was
6:00
in
the
morning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
of
these
lineups?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
on
your
submission
what
happens
at
the
trial?
the
state
wants
to
offer
a
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
there's
no
waiver
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
--
they
offered
is
an
objection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
would
the
state
do,
it
comes
in
and
it
doesn't
have
to
offer
then
and
their
proofs
how
the
confession
was
taken,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
the
aid
of
any
presumption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
if
after
it's
put
in
its
proofs
how
the
confession
was
taken
if
that
would
satisfy
a
finding
that
it
was
voluntary
then
it's
up
to
the
defendant
that
i
take
it
to
offer
proofs
to
set
up
a
conflict
in
that
respects
so
that
ultimately
that
maybe
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
it's
involuntary,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
how
they
--
that's
--
this
way
the
procedure
would
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
happens
now
--
what
happened
in
this
case
for
example?
was
just
that
the
confession
was
offered
and
then
the
state
left
the
defendant
go
ahead
otherwise
it
would've
been
received,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
on
the
bases
of
the
presumption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
was
after
that
that
the
officers
talk
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
we
had
any
case
that
touched
on
the
presumption
or
the
question
of
presumption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
rogers
and
richmond?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
of
any
case
of
ours
where
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
has
that
--
and
that's
been
in
the
context
of
looking
on
the
of
course,
confession
as
a
privilege
problems,
isn't
it?
bram
viewed
the
question
of
voluntariness
in
terms
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
anything
more
in
your
case
and
what
you
have
labeled
the
miranda
rules
then
that
the
absence
of
warnings
is
relevant
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
on
the
determination
of
voluntariness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
saying
anything
more
than
that,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
absence
of
warnings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
it
doesn’t
help
us
any
to
talk
about
those
as
miranda
rules
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
you're
not
just
going
further
than
you
have
to
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
turn
to
something
else
before
you—
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
your
proposition
that
the
issue
of
voluntariness
after
the
judges
decided
in
voir
dire
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
as
again
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
what's
your
view
of
the
defendant’s
position
if
he
is
taken
the
stand
in
the
voir
dire
under
the
presence
of
the
jury,
what
does
he
do
when
the
issue
of
voluntariness
has
then
became
the
subject
of
proof
before
the
jury
after
the
judge’s
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
initial
objection,
hearing
at
voir
dire,
am
i
right
to
think
that
this
case
what's
the
theory
on
the
premise
that
this
was
a
voluntary
confession,
the
argument
of
the
counsel
was
that
this
man
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
accurate
thinking
that
there
was
no
request
made
or
any
additional
request
made

.

beyond
that
he
said
there
was
no

my
taking
the
stand

all
the
evidence
points

you,
i

went
