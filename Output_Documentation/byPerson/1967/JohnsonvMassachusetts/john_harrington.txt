mr.
john
harrington
i
think
that
my
argument
will
deal
with
that
and
if
your
honor
does
not
feel
so,
i
feel
myself
charged
at
some
point
to
come
back
to
your
question.
mr.
john
harrington
well
to
continue
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court
as
you
will
recall
at
the
--
shortly
before
the
afternoon
recess
of
yesterday
i
had
asserted
that
the
position
which
i
assert
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
should
be
on
the
prosecution,
was
supported
by
miranda
v.
arizona
and
i
say
that
primarily
because
i
think
it’s
plain
in
miranda
and
the
arizona
that
it
is
intended
that
the
same
procedural
rules
with
respect
to
an
involuntary
confession
applied
in
both
state
and
federal
courts.
i
say
it
is
not,
it
is
of
significance
though
not
of
the
same
significance
that
the
miranda
rules
themselves
were
such
that
the
burden
of
proving
compliance
was
placed
squarely
on
the
prosecution.
i
should
also
observe
that
in
miranda
mr.
justice
clark
in
his
opinion
where
he
dissented
in
three
cases
and
concurred
in
one
says
this
is
at
page
503
of
the
opinion
and
i
think
that
i
would
best
read
this
sentence.
in
the
absence
of
warnings,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
state
to
prove
that
the
council
was
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
or
that
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
including
the
failure
to
give
the
necessary
warnings
the
confession
was
completely
voluntary.
now
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
even
that
standard
was
in
no
wise
observed
in
the
case
at
bar
where
there
was
custodial
interrogation.
there
was
clearly
an
absence
of
warnings.
the
burden
was
not
on
the
prosecution
and
indeed
the
voluntariness
question
was
not
considered
in
the
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
harrington
well
it
has
two
aspects
to
it.
it
has
the
aspect
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
voir
dire
that
was
held
as
a
preliminary
examination.
it
also
has
an
aspect
that
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
moment
that
in
this
particular
case
the
jury
never
received
a
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
mr.
john
harrington
what
i
suggest,
what
i
urge
i
that
the
burden
beyond
the
prosecution
of
showing
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
as
well
as
warnings
with
respect
to
the
confession.
this
is
the
english
rule,
it
is
the
rule
in
ireland,
it
is
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
it
is
the
rule
in
most
all
of
the
states.
there
are
seven
which
to
our
research
have
the
burden
on
the
whole
issue
of
voluntariness
placed
as
massachusetts
places
it.
my
argument
goes
just
to
the
voluntariness
issue.
mr.
john
harrington
my
argument
i
suggest
mr.
justice
black
is
entirely
consistent
with
your
dissent
in
the
denno
case.
and
your
dissent
contains
the
proposition
for
which
i
contend
that
the
--
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
explicit
waiver
that
the
jury
should
have
passed
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
harrington
correct.
mr.
john
harrington
exactly
with
the
burden
still
on
the
commonwealth
or
the
prosecution
show
that
it
is
voluntary.
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
yes,
i
of
course,
i'm
not
in
any
--
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
guidelines
in
miranda.
this
problem
arises
of
course
in
a
pre-miranda
case.
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
the
johnson
v
new
jersey?
mr.
john
harrington
i
say
that
was
the
last
point
but
i
might
as
well
come
to
it
right
now.
there
are
perhaps
three
aspects
to
this,
one
i
assert
that
these
constitutional
rules
with
respect
to
voluntariness
and
the
procedures
with
respect
to
voluntariness
are
such
that
they
are
retrospective
in
application.
indeed
in
johnson
v
new
jersey
this
court
said
that
the
defendants
convicted
prior
to
the
date
of
johnson
v
new
jersey
had
the
benefit
of
the
increasingly
meticulous
test
of
voluntaries
made
it
--
and
that
johnson
v
new
jersey
quite
plainly
distinguished
between
the
prospective
application
of
the
miranda
rules
and
the
escobedo
rule
and
the
test
with
respect
to
voluntariness.
so
i
say
that
on
this
branch
of
my
argument
as
to
procedures,
there
should
be
retrospective
application
with
respect
to
the
branch
of
my
argument
that
goes
to
the
point
that
as
a
matter
of
law
in
these
circumstances,
the
confession
should
begin
to
involuntary
--
that
involves
no
retrospectivity
or
prospectivity
problem
because
those
doctrines,
when
this
court
upon
its
own
independent
review
has
determined
that
a
confession
must
be
deemed
to
be
involuntary
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
exactly.
mr.
john
harrington
i'm
saying
that
one
of
the
circumstances
which
must
be
taken
into
account
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
in
this
free
miranda
case.
mr.
john
harrington
must
have
been
the
absence
of
warning.
mr.
john
harrington
i
feel
that
i
needlessly
caused
a
confusion
for
which
i
am
sorry.
my
only
point
with
respect
to
the
miranda
rules
and
i
should
have
made
this
clear,
it
is
that
sort
of
an
elementary
proposition
that
burden
of
proof
can
rise
to
constitutional
dimensions
and
the
fact
that
in
miranda,
the
rules
on
burden
of
proof
were
made
part
of
a
constitutional
rule
is
perhaps
that
really
doesn’t
need
to
be
said,
despite
of
the
miranda—
mr.
john
harrington
well,
further
in
argument
not
on
analysis
i
mean
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
the
spice
of
the
miranda
is
a
case
which
plainly
illustrates
that
the
burden
of
proof
can
rise
to
constitutional
dimensions
--
that
was
the
first
demanded
and
i
suggest
that
the
offense
involved
in
an
involuntary—
mr.
john
harrington
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
harrington
this
is
where
the
burden
has
the
real
bite
because
if
massachusetts
for
instance,
and
in
many
states
indeed
i
think
that
this
may
be
the
federal
rule,
if
you
take
this
--
if
the
criminal
defendant
takes
the
stand
for
any
aspect
of
the
case,
he
opens
himself
up
on
the
whole
case
--
sort
of
the
converse
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
the
cross
is
limited
to
the
issue.
but
in
massachusetts
there's
no
question.
if
he
takes
the
stand
to
testify
to
abiding
the
whole
issue
or
his
guilt
or
innocence
is
open
on
cross.
and
if
the
defendant
has
the
burden,
he
has
often
a
very
difficult
choice
to
make.
if
the
burden
is
otherwise,
if
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
so
that
they
have
to
prove
that
they
have
that
burden
then
in
all
the
circumstances,
the
confession
was
voluntary.
i
don’t
need
to
belay
that
the
importance
of
the
burden
rule
for
that
proposition.
it
strikes
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
jackson
v
denno
--
and
the
case
sensed
that
have
not
only
the
requirement
that
maybe
this
reliable
and
precise
determination
of
the
voluntariness
issue
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
but
that
also
imports
absent
and
post
expressed
waiver,
are
claiming
that
the
issue
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
harrington
no
he
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
harrington
well
i'm
saying
that
the
--
mr.
john
harrington
well
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
one,
this
case
in
one
a
general
answer.
the
general
answer,
i
suggest
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
were
different
it
then
becomes
always
a
jury
case.
if
this
is
part
of
the
government’s
burden,
the
jury
always
gets
it.
in
this
case,
even
though
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
i
say
that
if
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
rule
had
been
applied,
given
the
fact
that
there
was
before
the
jury,
the
evidence
of
this
man’s
injuries
of
his
custodial
isolation
of
his
absence
of
warning
it
appeared
in
the
negative
way
but
the
testimony
was,
is
that
all
that
they
said
and
all
that
was
said
was
a
confession.
i
mean
it
was
perfectly
obvious
there
was
an
absence
of
warning,
an
absence
of
counsel
and
isolation.
and
i
say
that
on
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
question
could
have
gone
to
the
jury.
now,
the
supreme
judicial
court
--
mr.
john
harrington
should
have
gone
sorry.
mr.
john
harrington
yes.
mr.
john
harrington
pardon.
mr.
john
harrington
i
mean
that
your
honor.
i
assert
it
and
i
say
that
the
answer
which
the
supreme
judicial
court
gave
to
these
propositions
when
advanced
to
them
were
twofold.
one,
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
involuntariness
before
the
jury
and
that
brings
up
this
sharp
question.
there
wasn’t
any
evidence
if
the
only
test
was
physical
beating.
there
was
evidence
if
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
must
be
considered.
that’s
the
very
--
both
positions
can’t
be
right
on
that.
mr.
john
harrington
it
doesn’t—
mr.
john
harrington
if
i
am
right,
that
will
be
true,
that’s
always
true
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
and
the
defendant
can
sit
there
through
the
whole
trial
and
move
verdict
of
acquittal
at
the
end
of
it
and
get
a
jury’s
verdict
at
the
end
of
it
without
ever
having
gotten
out
of
his
chair.
mr.
john
harrington
i
would
say
that
the
jury
should
be
entitled
as
the
government
having
the
burden
to
decide
that
the
government
had
failed
to
carry
it
and
had
not
persuaded
them
that
the
confession
was
in
all
the
circumstances
voluntary
whether
the
judge
has
or
has
not
--
they
don’t
get
the
question
unless
the
judge
has
satisfied
himself
that
applying
constitutional
criteria
that
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
john
harrington
that
is
right
at
the
trial
--
by
counsel
at
the
trial,
the
only
contention
was
made
in
response
to
the
judge’s
meticulous
query
was
that
a
physical
beating
was
relied
on.
mr.
john
harrington
right
and
after
hearing
his
evidence.
mr.
john
harrington
i
am
not
challenging.
that
is
the
finding
of
fact
undisputed
evidence
i
cannot
challenge.
mr.
john
harrington
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
harrington
quite
that
way
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wouldn’t
put
it
that
their
duty
was
to
negative
every
possible
contention.
i
would
put
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
persuade
the
triar
of
fact
in
the
first
instance
the
judge
at
the
voir
dire
and
then
the
jury
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
john
harrington
well
i
would
think
that
they
would,
by
showing
the
circumstances
and
if
they
didn’t
show,
if
for
instance,
if
they
had
to
show
that
there
was
no
warning
then
they
--
in
a
sense
they
have
shown
some
evidence
that’s
against
them
and
then
they
have
to
show
these
circumstances
under
which
the
--
mr.
john
harrington
well
my
argument
--
i
concede
that
my
argument
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
this
particular
case
where
it
did
appear
from
the
evidence,
from
the
defendant’s
mouth
that
there
was
a
beating.
and
if
the
suggestion
of
your
honor
be
that
that
is
such
to
shift
a
burden
of
proof
or
indeed
even
at
that
point
even
a
burden
of
going
forward,
this
case
meets
that,
however
from
my
observation,
my
analysis,
my
research
--
mr.
john
harrington
i
was
accepting
what
i
thought
was
a
suggestion
that
it
was
the
contention
rather
than
the
proof
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
triar
of
fact
which
was
enough
to
invoke
the
change
of
verdict
but
let
me
say
only
on
that,
that
well
i
think
my
argument
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
this
case
and
perhaps
it’s
dangerous
to
argue
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case,
i
suggest
that
an
analysis
of
the
authorities
and
analysis
of
the
principles
which
go
from
them
will
indicate
that
the
position
that
i
have
taken
is
the
only
one
that
reasonably
can
be
taken.
now
i
don’t
have
time
enough
to
develop
that.
i
just
want
to
very
briefly
in
the
moments
that
i
have
here
to
one
last
problem
in
this
case,
which
i
suggest
has
a
variety
of
intellectual
problems
to
it.
and
that
is
that
there
may
be
a
question
of
the
prospectivity
of
the
miranda
rules
with
respect
to
a
new
trial.
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
on
the
question
that
the
matter
of
law
--
as
a
matter
of
law
in
these
circumstances
the
confession
was
involuntary,
no
prospectivity
or
retrospectivity
question
is
reached.
however,
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
on
a
ground
that
the
procedures
adopted
by
the
massachusetts
courts
did
not
need
constitutional
standards
and
that
for
that
reason
johnson
was
entitled
for
a
new
trial.
then
i
suggest
the
question
arises
that
this
retrial
would
necessarily
be
after
the
miranda
decision
that
that
question
would
arise
in
my
brief
i
have
pointed
out
the
quite
not
split
that
has
occurred
on
that
and
i
command
the
reasoning
of
the
dorothy
case
in
california.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
harrington
i
think
that
my
argument
will
deal
with
that
and
if
your
honor
does
not
feel
so,
i
feel
myself
charged
at
some
point
to
come
back
to
your
question.
mr.
john
harrington
well
to
continue
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court
as
you
will
recall
at
the
--
shortly
before
the
afternoon
recess
of
yesterday
i
had
asserted
that
the
position
which
i
assert
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
should
be
on
the
prosecution,
was
supported
by
miranda
v.
arizona
and
i
say
that
primarily
because
i
think
it’s
plain
in
miranda
and
the
arizona
that
it
is
intended
that
the
same
procedural
rules
with
respect
to
an
involuntary
confession
applied
in
both
state
and
federal
courts.
i
say
it
is
not,
it
is
of
significance
though
not
of
the
same
significance
that
the
miranda
rules
themselves
were
such
that
the
burden
of
proving
compliance
was
placed
squarely
on
the
prosecution.
i
should
also
observe
that
in
miranda
mr.
justice
clark
in
his
opinion
where
he
dissented
in
three
cases
and
concurred
in
one
says
this
is
at
page
503
of
the
opinion
and
i
think
that
i
would
best
read
this
sentence.
in
the
absence
of
warnings,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
state
to
prove
that
the
council
was
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
or
that
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
including
the
failure
to
give
the
necessary
warnings
the
confession
was
completely
voluntary.
now
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
even
that
standard
was
in
no
wise
observed
in
the
case
at
bar
where
there
was
custodial
interrogation.
there
was
clearly
an
absence
of
warnings.
the
burden
was
not
on
the
prosecution
and
indeed
the
voluntariness
question
was
not
considered
in
the
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
harrington
well
it
has
two
aspects
to
it.
it
has
the
aspect
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
voir
dire
that
was
held
as
a
preliminary
examination.
it
also
has
an
aspect
that
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
moment
that
in
this
particular
case
the
jury
never
received
a
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
mr.
john
harrington
what
i
suggest,
what
i
urge
i
that
the
burden
beyond
the
prosecution
of
showing
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
as
well
as
warnings
with
respect
to
the
confession.
this
is
the
english
rule,
it
is
the
rule
in
ireland,
it
is
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
it
is
the
rule
in
most
all
of
the
states.
there
are
seven
which
to
our
research
have
the
burden
on
the
whole
issue
of
voluntariness
placed
as
massachusetts
places
it.
my
argument
goes
just
to
the
voluntariness
issue.
mr.
john
harrington
my
argument
i
suggest
mr.
justice
black
is
entirely
consistent
with
your
dissent
in
the
denno
case.
and
your
dissent
contains
the
proposition
for
which
i
contend
that
the
--
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
explicit
waiver
that
the
jury
should
have
passed
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
harrington
correct.
mr.
john
harrington
exactly
with
the
burden
still
on
the
commonwealth
or
the
prosecution
show
that
it
is
voluntary.
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
yes,
i
of
course,
i'm
not
in
any
--
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
guidelines
in
miranda.
this
problem
arises
of
course
in
a
pre-miranda
case.
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
the
johnson
v
new
jersey?
mr.
john
harrington
i
say
that
was
the
last
point
but
i
might
as
well
come
to
it
right
now.
there
are
perhaps
three
aspects
to
this,
one
i
assert
that
these
constitutional
rules
with
respect
to
voluntariness
and
the
procedures
with
respect
to
voluntariness
are
such
that
they
are
retrospective
in
application.
indeed
in
johnson
v
new
jersey
this
court
said
that
the
defendants
convicted
prior
to
the
date
of
johnson
v
new
jersey
had
the
benefit
of
the
increasingly
meticulous
test
of
voluntaries
made
it
--
and
that
johnson
v
new
jersey
quite
plainly
distinguished
between
the
prospective
application
of
the
miranda
rules
and
the
escobedo
rule
and
the
test
with
respect
to
voluntariness.
so
i
say
that
on
this
branch
of
my
argument
as
to
procedures,
there
should
be
retrospective
application
with
respect
to
the
branch
of
my
argument
that
goes
to
the
point
that
as
a
matter
of
law
in
these
circumstances,
the
confession
should
begin
to
involuntary
--
that
involves
no
retrospectivity
or
prospectivity
problem
because
those
doctrines,
when
this
court
upon
its
own
independent
review
has
determined
that
a
confession
must
be
deemed
to
be
involuntary
that
--
mr.
john
harrington
exactly.
mr.
john
harrington
i'm
saying
that
one
of
the
circumstances
which
must
be
taken
into
account
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
in
this
free
miranda
case.
mr.
john
harrington
must
have
been
the
absence
of
warning.
mr.
john
harrington
i
feel
that
i
needlessly
caused
a
confusion
for
which
i
am
sorry.
my
only
point
with
respect
to
the
miranda
rules
and
i
should
have
made
this
clear,
it
is
that
sort
of
an
elementary
proposition
that
burden
of
proof
can
rise
to
constitutional
dimensions
and
the
fact
that
in
miranda,
the
rules
on
burden
of
proof
were
made
part
of
a
constitutional
rule
is
perhaps
that
really
doesn’t
need
to
be
said,
despite
of
the
miranda—
mr.
john
harrington
well,
further
in
argument
not
on
analysis
i
mean
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
the
spice
of
the
miranda
is
a
case
which
plainly
illustrates
that
the
burden
of
proof
can
rise
to
constitutional
dimensions
--
that
was
the
first
demanded
and
i
suggest
that
the
offense
involved
in
an
involuntary—
mr.
john
harrington
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
harrington
this
is
where
the
burden
has
the
real
bite
because
if
massachusetts
for
instance,
and
in
many
states
indeed
i
think
that
this
may
be
the
federal
rule,
if
you
take
this
--
if
the
criminal
defendant
takes
the
stand
for
any
aspect
of
the
case,
he
opens
himself
up
on
the
whole
case
--
sort
of
the
converse
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
the
cross
is
limited
to
the
issue.
but
in
massachusetts
there's
no
question.
if
he
takes
the
stand
to
testify
to
abiding
the
whole
issue
or
his
guilt
or
innocence
is
open
on
cross.
and
if
the
defendant
has
the
burden,
he
has
often
a
very
difficult
choice
to
make.
if
the
burden
is
otherwise,
if
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
so
that
they
have
to
prove
that
they
have
that
burden
then
in
all
the
circumstances,
the
confession
was
voluntary.
i
don’t
need
to
belay
that
the
importance
of
the
burden
rule
for
that
proposition.
it
strikes
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
jackson
v
denno
--
and
the
case
sensed
that
have
not
only
the
requirement
that
maybe
this
reliable
and
precise
determination
of
the
voluntariness
issue
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
but
that
also
imports
absent
and
post
expressed
waiver,
are
claiming
that
the
issue
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
harrington
no
he
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
harrington
well
i'm
saying
that
the
--
mr.
john
harrington
well
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
one,
this
case
in
one
a
general
answer.
the
general
answer,
i
suggest
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
were
different
it
then
becomes
always
a
jury
case.
if
this
is
part
of
the
government’s
burden,
the
jury
always
gets
it.
in
this
case,
even
though
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
i
say
that
if
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
rule
had
been
applied,
given
the
fact
that
there
was
before
the
jury,
the
evidence
of
this
man’s
injuries
of
his
custodial
isolation
of
his
absence
of
warning
it
appeared
in
the
negative
way
but
the
testimony
was,
is
that
all
that
they
said
and
all
that
was
said
was
a
confession.
i
mean
it
was
perfectly
obvious
there
was
an
absence
of
warning,
an
absence
of
counsel
and
isolation.
and
i
say
that
on
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
question
could
have
gone
to
the
jury.
now,
the
supreme
judicial
court
--
mr.
john
harrington
should
have
gone
sorry.
mr.
john
harrington
yes.
mr.
john
harrington
pardon.
mr.
john
harrington
i
mean
that
your
honor.
i
assert
it
and
i
say
that
the
answer
which
the
supreme
judicial
court
gave
to
these
propositions
when
advanced
to
them
were
twofold.
one,
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
involuntariness
before
the
jury
and
that
brings
up
this
sharp
question.
there
wasn’t
any
evidence
if
the
only
test
was
physical
beating.
there
was
evidence
if
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
must
be
considered.
that’s
the
very
--
both
positions
can’t
be
right
on
that.
mr.
john
harrington
it
doesn’t—
mr.
john
harrington
if
i
am
right,
that
will
be
true,
that’s
always
true
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
and
the
defendant
can
sit
there
through
the
whole
trial
and
move
verdict
of
acquittal
at
the
end
of
it
and
get
a
jury’s
verdict
at
the
end
of
it
without
ever
having
gotten
out
of
his
chair.
mr.
john
harrington
i
would
say
that
the
jury
should
be
entitled
as
the
government
having
the
burden
to
decide
that
the
government
had
failed
to
carry
it
and
had
not
persuaded
them
that
the
confession
was
in
all
the
circumstances
voluntary
whether
the
judge
has
or
has
not
--
they
don’t
get
the
question
unless
the
judge
has
satisfied
himself
that
applying
constitutional
criteria
that
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
john
harrington
that
is
right
at
the
trial
--
by
counsel
at
the
trial,
the
only
contention
was
made
in
response
to
the
judge’s
meticulous
query
was
that
a
physical
beating
was
relied
on.
mr.
john
harrington
right
and
after
hearing
his
evidence.
mr.
john
harrington
i
am
not
challenging.
that
is
the
finding
of
fact
undisputed
evidence
i
cannot
challenge.
mr.
john
harrington
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
harrington
quite
that
way
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wouldn’t
put
it
that
their
duty
was
to
negative
every
possible
contention.
i
would
put
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
persuade
the
triar
of
fact
in
the
first
instance
the
judge
at
the
voir
dire
and
then
the
jury
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
john
harrington
well
i
would
think
that
they
would,
by
showing
the
circumstances
and
if
they
didn’t
show,
if
for
instance,
if
they
had
to
show
that
there
was
no
warning
then
they
--
in
a
sense
they
have
shown
some
evidence
that’s
against
them
and
then
they
have
to
show
these
circumstances
under
which
the
--
mr.
john
harrington
well
my
argument
--
i
concede
that
my
argument
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
this
particular
case
where
it
did
appear
from
the
evidence,
from
the
defendant’s
mouth
that
there
was
a
beating.
and
if
the
suggestion
of
your
honor
be
that
that
is
such
to
shift
a
burden
of
proof
or
indeed
even
at
that
point
even
a
burden
of
going
forward,
this
case
meets
that,
however
from
my
observation,
my
analysis,
my
research
--
mr.
john
harrington
i
was
accepting
what
i
thought
was
a
suggestion
that
it
was
the
contention
rather
than
the
proof
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
triar
of
fact
which
was
enough
to
invoke
the
change
of
verdict
but
let
me
say
only
on
that,
that
well
i
think
my
argument
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
this
case
and
perhaps
it’s
dangerous
to
argue
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case,
i
suggest
that
an
analysis
of
the
authorities
and
analysis
of
the
principles
which
go
from
them
will
indicate
that
the
position
that
i
have
taken
is
the
only
one
that
reasonably
can
be
taken.
now
i
don’t
have
time
enough
to
develop
that.
i
just
want
to
very
briefly
in
the
moments
that
i
have
here
to
one
last
problem
in
this
case,
which
i
suggest
has
a
variety
of
intellectual
problems
to
it.
and
that
is
that
there
may
be
a
question
of
the
prospectivity
of
the
miranda
rules
with
respect
to
a
new
trial.
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
on
the
question
that
the
matter
of
law
--
as
a
matter
of
law
in
these
circumstances
the
confession
was
involuntary,
no
prospectivity
or
retrospectivity
question
is
reached.
however,
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
on
a
ground
that
the
procedures
adopted
by
the
massachusetts
courts
did
not
need
constitutional
standards
and
that
for
that
reason
johnson
was
entitled
for
a
new
trial.
then
i
suggest
the
question
arises
that
this
retrial
would
necessarily
be
after
the
miranda
decision
that
that
question
would
arise
in
my
brief
i
have
pointed
out
the
quite
not
split
that
has
occurred
on
that
and
i
command
the
reasoning
of
the
dorothy
case
in
california.
thank
you
your
honor.
