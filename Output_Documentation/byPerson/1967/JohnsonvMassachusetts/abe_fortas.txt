justice

fortas
mr.
harrington
i
am
very
impressed
with
your
response
to
the
question
that
justice
douglas
asked
you
yesterday,
whether
the
points
that
you
are
making
here
were
properly
raised
below.
i
assume
you're
going
to
get
to
that
this
morning.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that’s
justice
douglas’
question
yesterday
which
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
to,
i
just
wanted
to
remind
you
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
in
addition
to
that
that
it
includes
the
guidelines
in
miranda?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
johnson
case
retroactive
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
are
the
issues
though
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
and
this
particular
case
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
specific
question
that
was
raised
was
that
of
physical
beatings.
and
no
other
claim
was
made
at
best
two
of
the
question
of
voluntariness.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
found
that
--
found
against
the
defendant
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
i
remember
correctly
that
you're
not
challenging
that
finding?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
is
it
your
position
that
although
other
issues
were
not
raised,
it
is
the
state’s
duty
to
go
ahead
and
to
show
somehow
that
a
length
of
the
arraignment
or
the
length
of
the
confinement
and
questioning
was
not
such
as
to
produce
involuntariness
conclusion
of
involuntariness
that
he
was
well
fared
so
that
that
didn’t
have
any
bearing
on
it
and
it
either
had
counsel
or
waived
counsel
or
was
or
was
not
warned,
is
that
sort
of
thing
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
once
a
defendant
asserts
that
the
confession
was
involved
the
state
has
a
duty
without
reference
to
any
particularization
of
reasons
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
as
to
why
the
defendant
claims
the
admission
was
involuntary.
the
state
then
has
the
duty
to
negative
all
possible
factors,
which
might
be
result
in
a
conclusion
that
the
confession
was
involuntary.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now
tell
me
how
do
you
do
that?
how
does
the
state
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
assume
that
miranda
was
not
retroactive
and
if
we
assume
that
the
warning
is
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
necessary
in
this
case
because
it’s
pre-miranda.
then,
i
should
think
that
it
was
not
the
duty
of
the
state
in
this
case
or
we
can
hold
that
that
was
the
duty
of
the
state
in
this
case
to
show
that
the
warning
was
given.
and
i
don’t
understand
frankly,
i
have
a
greatest
difficulty
and
coming
to
grips
with
your
point.
now
it’s
possible
quite
possible
to
argue
that
when
the
defendant
raises
a
specific
issue
such
as
that
the
confession
was
the
result
of
physical
beating.
when
he
raises
that
due
to
some
evidence
however
small,
then
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
either
he
was
not
physically
beating
or
that
the
physical
beating
had
no
causal
connection
with
the
confession.
and
i
can
understand
your
burden
of
proof
argument
in
that
respect.
but
when
you
--
i
understand
that
you're
going
much
further
than
that
in
saying
that
regardless
of
the
specific
issues
that
the
defendant
tendered,
the
state
has
to
go
ahead
and
prove
voluntariness.
i
don’t
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
but
right
there,
i
wonder
if
it
does
because
you
say
you're
not
challenging
the
finding
and
there
was
no
physical
beating
while
he
was
in
jail
or
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
a
cause
of
connection
with
the
confession?
but
you're
not
challenging
then
i
don’t
say
we
can
conclude
anything
other
than
that
the
state
whatever
burden
that
has
with
respect
to
the
physical
beating
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mentioned
that
he
was
in
the
service,
how
did
he
leave
the
service?
justice
abe
fortas
something
to
do
with
intelligence?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
concannon,
you
seem
to
stress
that
this
man
had
had
some
experience
with
the
courts
and
with
interrogation
and
that
he
said
he
knew
his
rights
and
that
he
did
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
of
the
police
and
that
he
would
not
answer
their
questions.
yet
after
that
they
questioned
him
from
what
it
was
9:30
at
night
until
6
o’clock
in
the
morning.
would
that
not
indicate
that
what
he
said
was
involuntary?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
surroundings
were
at
the
time
he
was
questioned.
who
questioned
him
and
what
the
surroundings
were
as
to
whether
it
might
have
been
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
tell
us
how
bad
did
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
were
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
after
that?
justice
abe
fortas
100
policemen
and
how
many
quizzed
him?
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
he
the
only
man
who
spoke
to
the
defendant
in
that
period
of
time
among
the
officers?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
some
allegation
that
there
were
a
great
men
--
police
officers
who
came
in
and
(inaudible)
him
and
taunted
him
about
certain
things
and
so
fort.
i
think
something
like
32
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
testimony
in
the
case
that
was
not
denied.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
beating,
i'm
talking
about
the
number
who
were
there
in
the
surroundings
when
he
was
being
interrogated
and
who
asked
him
questions
and
so
forth.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
record
itself
the
reason
to
have
100
policemen
in
that
room
while
this
man
talks?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
your
adversary’s
position
is
that
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
voir
dire
and
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof
before
the
jury
to
show
voluntariness,
that’s
my
understanding
of
this
decision.
i
suppose
we
should
find
--
i
suppose
we
should
conclude
and
by
no
means
at
that
point
but
suppose
we
should
conclude
that
the
voir
dire
finding
of
voluntariness
or
that
the
case
had
not
been
made
to
show
involuntariness.
suppose
we
should
conclude
that
that
was
error,
then
will
it
be
your
point
that
that’s
immaterial
and
that
we
should
nevertheless
affirm
the
judgment
below.
justice
abe
fortas
on
voir
dire.
justice
abe
fortas
yeah.
justice
abe
fortas
right,
suppose
we
went
along
with
your
adversary
directing
yourself
only
to
voir
dire,
to
the
voir
dire
plan,
would
that
require
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
here
in,
do
you
concede
that
that
would
require
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
or
do
you
think
that
that’s
voiced
out
by
the
failure
of
the
defendant’s
counsel
to
make
a
point
before
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
there
were
constitutional
error
in
the
failure
of
finding
voluntariness
in
voir
dire
that
that
is
immaterial
for
the
(inaudible)
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
if
we
find
--
so
that
we
can
dispose
off
this
case
by
looking
only
at
the
voir
dire
proceedings
and
if
we
agree
with
your
adversary
and
we
agree
that
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
was
wrong,
then
we
would
have
to
reverse.
justice
abe
fortas
you
still
have
the
problem
of
what
happened
on
voir
dire
don’t
you?
that
is
say
whether
the
state
--
whether
the
state
has
a
burden
of
proof
showing
voluntariness
on
the
voir
dire
and
whether
the
state
bore
that
burden
of
proof
here.
justice
abe
fortas
we
better
decide
one
other
thing
too
which
is
somehow
rather
your
brother’s
concession
that
he
is
not
attacking
the
finding
of
voluntariness
in
terms
of
the
physical
beating
issue
that
is
said
that
somehow
rather
that
doesn’t
preclude
us
from
getting
to
this
issue
don’t
we?
justice

mr.

i
