justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
he
do
that?
i
thought
i
heard
you
read
the
judge
to
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
“the
only
thing
is
brutality”
and
the
trial
lawyers
said,
“yes,
that
is
the
only
point”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
recognize
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
be
on
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
ma
--
i'm
talking
about,
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that
rule
in
massachusetts
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
is
on
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
if
the
defendant
puts
nothing
and
--
the
confession
goes
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
then
say
that
trial
counsel
represented
the
defendant
cannot
limit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can
say
that
the
only
objection
we
are
making
to
this
confession
is
that
it
was
obtained
as
a
result
of
brutality.
that's
the
only
objection
we
make
to
it.
then
at
a
later
date
he
raises
four
other
points.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
did
he
take
the
stand
in
front
of
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
he
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
it’s
a
question
for
the
jury.
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
--
and
the
defendant
to
not
take
the
stand
before
the
jury,
and
puts
on
no
evidence
to
support
the
involuntariness
of
the
confession
before
the
jury
how
can
it
then
become
a
jury
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
good
enough
what
you
mean?
it
could
have
gone
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
have
gone
to
the
jury
and
failure
to
go
to
the
jury
is
it
error
sufficient
for
reversion
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
concannon,
do
you
go
farther
to
say
he
didn’t
need
a
lawyer
to
trial?
but
how
efficient
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
why
he
questioned
on
12
at
midnight
until
6
am
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
what
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
what
purposes?
wasn’t
it
for
the
question
of
wrapping
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
normal
question
people
from
12
midnight
until
6
in
the
morning
is
--
he
should
be
at
sleep
that
time
don’t
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
courts
don’t
run
12
midnight
until
6
in
the
morning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
at
this
point
--
is
it
true
that
johnson
was
not
a
prime
suspect
isn’t
it
true
that
at
12
o’clock
he
was
the
one
and
only
certain
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
a
gun
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
purpose
of
convicting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
need
a
lawyer
when
you're
trying
to
get
a
man,
convict
the
man
out
of
his
own
--
he
doesn’t
need
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn’t
warned
that
he
didn’t
have
to
say
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
can
you
qualify
past
the
judge’s
determination
that
there
was
a
state
of
confusion—
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
created
the
confusion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
boston
to
have
100
policemen
in
the
police
precinct
at
3,
or
4
or
5
in
the
morning.
is
that
common?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
common
to
have
that
many
police
in
the
headquarters
3
or
4
o
clock
in
the
morning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
help
you
if
i
would
suggest
that
possibly
you
don’t
hold
lineups
that
time
in
the
morning
usually,
or
do
they
do
that
in
boston?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
concannon,
did
the
trial
judge
ever
mentioned
his
weight
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ever
mention
that
rule
as
such
or
that
he
was
relying
on
that
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
in
the
statement.
he
said
in
the
statement
that
there
were
many
(inaudible)
--
may
i
just
state
beyond
free
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
to
the
statement
on
page
199
that’s
kind
of
(inaudible)
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
customary
on
massachusetts
for
--
or
was
it
at
this
time
customary
in
the
case
of
the
confession
for
the
officers
there
or
somebody
who
was
there
to
testify
that
this
statement
was
given
free
and
voluntary
that
no
promises
were
made
or
no
threats
were
made
or
no
coercion
of
any
kind
that
it
was
free
and
voluntary
would
that
be
the
practice
in
the
massachusetts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wonder
why
that
was
done
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
were
100
police
officers
there
and
they
yet
not
one
of
them
testified
to
the
surroundings
of
the
confession
or
that
it
was
free
and
voluntary
in
any
respect,
they
just
took
the
words
of
the
defendant
as
they
came
from
the
statement
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wonder
why
those
tactics
would
have
been
used
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
that
time
not
as
he
do
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
it
was
customary
to
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
case
this
court
has
had
in
which
they
held
a
man
and
questioned
for
about
6
hours
intermittently,
took
into
full
lineups
and
have
people
ask
him
question
which
were
taken
down
by
a
stenographer
and
then
took
him
in
a
room
with
100
policeman,
do
you
know
of
any
this
is,
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
up
in
massachusetts
that
approves
such
a
procedure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
he
taken
to
full
lineups
during
that
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
was
48
hours
continuous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
continuous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
man
was
never
during
all
that
period,
he
was
never
in
jail.
he
was
in
the
police
headquarters,
with
nobody
there
but
polices
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
night.
probably
6
o'clock
in
the
morning,
and
you
said
we
are
bound
to
uphold
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
wouldn’t
the
question
of
a
man
in
a
room
by
himself
with
100
policeman,
could
that
possibly
shock
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
he
do
that?
i
thought
i
heard

justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

would

justice
thurgood

i'm

thurgood

do
you
think
if
the

the

goes
out?
justice
thurgood

you
then
say
that
trial
counsel
represented
the

justice
thurgood

but
he
can
say
that
the

is
that
it

as
a

of

that's
the
only
objection
we
make
to
it.
then
at
a
later
date
he
raises
four
other
points.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
did
he
take
the
stand
in
front
of
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
he
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
it’s
a
question
for
the

the
voluntariness
of

and
the

to

before
the

and
puts
on
no

the

how
can
it
then
become
a

question?
justice
thurgood

is
good
enough
what
you
mean?
it
could
have
gone
--
justice
thurgood

should
have
gone
to
the

and
failure
to
go
to
the

is
it
error
sufficient
for

justice
thurgood

do
you
mean
that
or
not?
justice
thurgood

do
you
mean
that?
justice
thurgood

mr.

do
you
go
farther
to
say
he
didn’t
need
a

to

but
how
efficient
was
he?
justice
thurgood

may
i
ask
why
he
questioned
on

justice
thurgood

the

he

justice
thurgood

well
the

don’t
run

justice
thurgood

at
