mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
mr.--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
by
that
judgment,
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
which
imposed
the
death
penalty
on
ronald
johnson,
the
petitioner
here.
the
trial
court
imposed
the
death
penalty
following
johnson's
conviction
by
a
jury
of
first
degree
murder.
the
issues
which
this
case
brings
here
arise
out
of
the
use
at
trial
of
a
question
and
answer
statement
amounting
to
a
confession
which
was
used
over
objection.
those
issues
--
first,
as
to
whether
on
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
that
confession
could've
been
determined
to
be
voluntary
or
conversely
must
be
declared
to
be
involuntary.
and
the
other
issues
which
arise
with
respect
to
that
confession,
i
would
respect
to
the
procedures
used
by
the
massachusetts
courts
with
respect
to
that
confession.
addressing
myself
first
to
the
first
issue
i
mentioned,
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
are
as
follows:
the
petitioner
johnson
was
taken
into
custody
at
approximately
9:30
pm
on
the
evening
of
august
1st,
1963.
immediately
prior
to
his
being
taken
into
custody
he
had
been
the
object
of
a
pursuit.
the
shooting
for
which
he
was
subsequently
indicted
had
occurred
at
approximately
9:00
pm
of
that
evening.
johnson
was
pursued
in
the
car
which
he
was
driving
by
several
--
by
succession
indeed
of
police
vehicles.
and
the
car
he
was
driving
was
then
in
a
collision
with
a
bus.
johnson
emerged
from
that
car
on
foot
and
after
a
relatively
brief
foot
pursuit
he
was
apprehended
under
a
porch
and
brought
by
policemen
to
a
police
box
and
that's
in
a
police
car
to
the
local
station
house
in
the
district
of
boston
known
as
roxbury.
there,
johnson
was
booked
and
he
was
booked
amid
circumstances
which
the
trial
judge
found
were
attended
by
confusion,
turmoil
and
strain.
he
was
plainly
injured
at
the
time,
there's
no
question
that
he
was
bleeding
on
the
head
and
around
the
neck
at
the
time
he
was
booked.
he
was
then
placed
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
don't
know.
he
--
there
was
a
collision
with
a
bus.
he
emerged
from
the
car
which
was
badly
damaged,
no
question
to
that,
but
i
don't
know
as
to
--
i
make
no
contention
either
way
on
this,
i
--
but
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
it
was
clear
in
the
record.
it
merely
was
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
bleeding
and
was
injured
at
that
time.
he
was
placed
in
a
cell
and
he
was
given
some
first
aid,
this
at
the
local
station
house.
and
at
the
local
station
house
occurred
the
first
of
several
confrontations.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
oh,
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
on
this
but
it
would've
been
inevitable
between
9
--
he
was
booked
at
9:35.
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
9:30;
he
was
booked
at
9:35
on
suspicion
of
murder.
he
was
taken
down
to
the
police
headquarters
which
is
five
miles
away,
sometime
around
midnight,
so
that,
the
first
of
these
confrontations,
there
maybe
a
record
time
on
it
but
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
search
it
out,
it
was
in
this
interlude.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
essentially
first
aid,
a
doctor
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
a
doctor.
a
doctor
and
a
--
the
cut
was
cleaned
off
and
a
--
some
--
a
bandage
put
on
it.
and
then
this
confrontation
was
conducted
by
a
lieutenant
donovan
who
was
the
officer
in-charged
of
these
proceedings
throughout
the
rest
of
the
night.
and
it
consisted
of
being
a
--
johnson
being
identified
by
a
witness
and
a
little
colloquy
of
an
equivocal
nature
and
it
be
--
that
colloquy
being
recorded
by
a
police
stenographer
who
was
there,
who
was
not
identified
to
johnson
as
such.
i
state
at
this
point
that
it's
perfectly
clear
and
there's
no
dispute
about
this
that
at
no
time
during
the
evening
up
until
this
question
and
answer
confession
which
occurred
at
6
o'clock,
had
at
no
time
in
the
custody
of
the
police
was
johnson
warned
that
he
might
be
silent,
that
anything
he
would
--
said
would
be
used
against
him
or
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
better
put
it
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court
who
was
--
said
it
quite
plainly
on
his
--
on
some
findings
which
appear
at
page
2
--
329
of
the
record.
no
police
officer
told
the
defendant
at
any
time
from
the
time
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
the
rear
of
20
fernwood
road
until
he
had
completed
his
statement
to
lieutenant
donovan
that
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
put
to
him
by
the
police
or
that
anything
he
said
to
the
police
might
or
could
be
used
against
him.
so,
that
is
clear
as
throughout
the
evening.
after
--
at
some
point
after
this
confrontation
as
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
august
1st,
1963
prior
of
course
to
the
escobedo
decision
and
prior
to
the
--
of
course,
obviously
the
miranda
ruling.
the
--
johnson
was
then
taken
on
approximately
midnight
to
police
headquarters.
and
there
he
was
placed
in
several
lineups
throughout
the
evening.
he
was
by
himself.
there
were
--
as
the
record
shows
a
very
large
number
of
policemen
been
involved
in
these
proceedings
of
the
order
of
--
that
at
least
50
and
to
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that
was
somewhat
before
midnight,
it's
actually
station
10.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
then
the
line
ups
are
between
midnight
and
4:30.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
the
procedure
--
there's
just
no
dispute
about
this
that
the
procedure
in
the
lineups
wasn't
on
a
number
of
occasions,
a
witness
would
confront
johnson
and
say
something
to
him,
johnson
would
make
some
sort
of
an
equivocal
reply.
it
would
be
taken
down
on
this
--
there
was
another
stenographer,
they
were
two
of
them
who
testified
in
this
regard.
and
it
would
be
taken
down
and
the
stenographer
was
not
unidentified
to
just
in
these
confrontations.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
the
trial
judge
found
they
were
four.
i
found
two
on
the
record
but
i
can
say
that
because
mr.
concannon,
my
brother
has
said
to
the
trial
judge
found
they
were
four.
they
were
--
of
that
order.
and
some
might
--
there
might
have
been
three.
there
was
a
little
confusion
about
that
if
they
had
--
there
could've
been
four.
you
could
say
they
were
two
but
in
any
event
it
was
of
that
order.
and
the
witnesses
who
identified
johnson
or
some
of
the
witnesses
who
identified
johnson
and
there
were
several,
testified
that
a
--
as
he
appeared
in
the
lineup,
blood
appeared
on
various
parts
of
his
body,
some
on
his
head,
some
on
his
legs,
his
clothing
was
tattered
and
torn.
so
that
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
without
dispute
that
through
the
evening
there
was
still
observation
of
bleeding
and
bruise,
some
injury.
with
respect
to
the
injury
it's
also
clear
that
two
weeks
after
the
confession,
johnson
was
operated
on
for
a
condition
called
a
subdural
hematoma
which
is
a
collection
of
blood
between
the
dura
and
the
brain
and
that
condition
was
relieved.
and
the
record
goes
as
five
but
no
further
than
--
that
it
was
that
condition
was
consistent
with
having
been
there
two
weeks.
which
goes
takes
it
back
to
the
time
of
this
confession.
then
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning,
approximately,
in
a
room
in
police
headquarters,
the
statement
was
taken
by
a
police
stenographer,
the
only
persons
present
were
policemen.
and
the
statement
was
in
question
and
answers
form
and
as
i
believe
will
be
apparent
upon
the
slightest
reading
of
it.
it
is
a
catalog
of
the
prima
facie
elements
of
each
of
the
crimes
so
which
johnson
was
indicted
four
days
later
to
wit
--
murder
in
the
first
degree,
armed
robbery
while
masked,
assault
and
battery
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
carrying
of
a
revolver
without
a
license
and
carrying
of
a
revolver
in
a
vehicle
without
a
license.
and
the
q
&
a
goes
right
down
each
of
the
elements
goes
through
the
license
and
all
of
that.
it
further
appears
that
johnson
was
an
unemployed
man
of
--
with
an
iq
that
was
taken
by
the
state
in
the
proceedings
under
the
so-called
briggs
law.
with
an
iq
of
86
and
education
that
pitted
out
somewhere
when
he
was
16
years
old,
he
certainly
didn't
get
beyond
the
eight
grade,
he
might
have
been
still
on
the
sixth
grade
in
special
classes.
the
--
his
answers
to
the
examining
people
are
not
entirely
clear
but
at
16
he
quit
school
and
he
was
either
on
a
special
eight
grade
or
a
sixth
grade,
one
of
the
two.
i
think
i
urged
your
honors
that
on
this
recitation
of
the
facts,
the
facts
very
largely
speak
for
themselves.
here,
we
plainly
have
a
citizen
who
was
injured,
was
disadvantaged
in
this
intellect,
in
his
education
who
was
the
subject
of
a
process
which
to
use
the
colloquial
terms,
box
him
in
by
the
confrontations
in
the
interrogations.
and
then
in
our
atmosphere
it
is
unquestionably
police
dominated
and
without
warning
advice
or
counsel
or
friend
or
adviser,
he
gives
a
question
and
answer
statement
which
is
a
catalog
of
the
prima
facie
elements
of
these
crimes.
quite
plainly,
this
was
in
no
sense
an
attempt
to
find
out
what
had
happened.
it
was
a
procedure
to
wrap
up
the
case.
the
trial
judge
found
that
at
the
time
of
the
confession,
johnson
was
the
prime
suspect
in
the
felonious
homicide
of
james
b.
o'leary
who
was
the
victim
of
the
shooting.
now
the
--
i
am
not
going
to
contend
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
no
i
was
not.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
came
into
this
case
shortly
prior
to
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
was
filed
following
the
decision
in
escobedo.
my
appointment
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
the
--
there
was
an
objection
to
this
confession
and
i
will
come
to
that
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
in
a
moment
your
honor.
by
--
but
there
was
an
objection
it
came
in
clearly
over
objection,
there's
no
question
of
that.
but
not
--
the
objection
was
not
as
i
will
point
out,
not
based
on
all
of
these
reasons
i
assert.
but
it
is
perfectly
quite
plain
that
each
of
these
items
that
i
speak
of
have
their
reflections
in
decided
cases
of
this
court
which
have
held
confessions
to
be
as
a
matter
of
law
and
upon
review
by
this
court
involuntary.
those
cases
reflect
--
it
has
been
said
a
number
of
values
which
come
together.
and
i
urge
that
the
very
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case
shows
that
this
is
a
case
which
reflects
all
of
those
values
which
have
caused
this
court
to
proscribe
the
use
of
a
confession
in
these
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
a
curious
use
of
language
to
call
an
act
performed
and
i
--
by
act
i
mean
the
confession
performed
in
these
circumstances
by
such
a
person,
taking
them
all
together.
i
suggest
that
as
a
curious
use
of
language
to
call
it
voluntary.
and
that
--
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
doctrines
which
those
cases
exemplify
call
upon
this
court
upon
its
review
of
these
facts
not
in
dispute
to
declare
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
unless
infected
the
conviction
with
a
fatal
invalidity.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
yes
very
much
so.
a
part
from
the
dominance
i
put
my
finger
very
strongly
on
the
practice
of
having
johnson
confronted
by
a
witness
and
the
response
being
--
and
then
a
response
which
is
equivocal.
the
law
of
massachusetts
being
that
a
person
in
custody
of
course,
his
silence
cannot
be
used
against
him.
his
denial
cannot
be
used
against
him,
but
an
equivocal
statement
can
be
used
against
him.
its
--
in
a
response
such
as
this
which
appears
on
the
record.
if
he
was
a
long
way
from
the
car,
how
did
he
spot
me?
this
--
a
response
to
the
officer
in
the
light
of
an
identification.
now,
that's
has
its
echo
in
a
very
old
case
which
your
honors
may
well
remember
in
brown
versus
the
united
states
that
make
who
was
called
in
and
that
was
the
--
a
lead
of
course
as
we
all
know,
like
lead
case
for
the
federal
courts.
if
he
was
standing
on
that
place
on
the
deck,
how
did
he
see
me?
and
those
are
the
--
that
is
i
suggest
the
purpose
of
that
kind
of
a
confrontation
recorded
mind
you,
recorded
not
surreptitiously.
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
reporter
was
--
police
reporter
was
there
with
a
notebook
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
what
i'm
complaining
about
not
--
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
fact
that
the
witness
identified
but
what
i
am
complaining
about
on
mr.
johnson's
behalf
is
that
that
procedure
where
johnson
without
counsel,
without
advise,
an
ignorant
man
was
put
in
that
position
where
--
whether
or
not
he
came
through
with
the
q
&
a
at
6
o'clock.
a
lot
of
mileage
had
been
made.
before
6
o'clock
on
that
man
without
a
q
&
a
and
it
was
all
down
there
that
this
was
not
idle
conversation.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
police
were
doing
an
efficient
wrap
up
job
here.
they
didn't
have
the
stenographer
their
to
treasure
the
pros,
i
mean
they
had
a
reason
for
it
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
that
police
action
not
of
itself
but
with
all
these
other
factors.
for
instance,
in
spano
this
court
gave
considerable
weight
to
the
undeviating
purpose
of
the
officers
to
produce
the
confession.
the
--
there
and
spano
was
--
is
the
lead
one
but
there
are
other
cases
where
the
--
where
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
police
were
proceeding
to
a
wrap
up
procedure
was
a
factor
which
this
court
gave
weight
in
all
the
circumstances
on
the
question
of
whether
this
court
would
deem
the
confessions
to
be
invalid.
now,
i
hope
--
i'd
like
not
to
tell
you
on
this
point
fundamental
as
it
is
to
my
position
because
i
now
want
to
come
to
the
procedures
which
i
--
which
are
quite
a
separate
point
and
do
not
in
any
sense
depend
nor
does
the
point
i
have
just
made
depend
on
them.
my
first
point
is
that
the
courts
in
massachusetts
never
in
their
procedure
gave
consideration
to
this
issue
with
the
range
of
criteria
which
this
court
requires.
i
don't
need
to
argue
that
this
court
has
said
that
these
items
i
have
argued
about
of
the
mental
and
educational
condition
of
the
defendant,
his
injuries,
his
custodial
isolation,
his
warnings
or
lack
of
warning,
are
the
criteria
which
must
be
considered
on
this
question.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
argue
either
that
the
courts
below
must
pay
he
to
the
criteria
set
down
by
this
court
in
making
that
determination.
i
scarcely
need
to
argue
that
in
this
case,
the
massachusetts
courts
did
not
give
consideration
to
that
broad
range
of
criteria,
to
that
increasingly
meticulous
test
which
--
as
was
said
in
one
of
the
recent
cases
of
this
court.
i'll
come
to
the
reason
why,
which
is
my
third
point,
but
i
thought
that
an
orderly
presentation
would
require
establishing
this
point
that
they
did
not
first.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
that
the
trial
court
at
the
trial
itself
did
not
--
considered
only
one
aspect
and
that
appears
and
i
can
only
do
this
--
i
can
do
this
best
by
reading
it
at
page
189
where
the
trial
justice
said
to
the
then
defense
counsel,
the
contention
of
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it
is
that,
and
there's
a
typographical
error,
is
that
the
statement
was
involuntarily
given
because
of
physical
force
applied
to
the
defendant
by
the
police
so
that
the
statement
was
coerced
from
him.
that
is
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
the
defendant
takes
is
that
correct
mr.
colloquo
(ph)?
mr.
colloquo
(ph):
"that
is
correct
your
honor".
this
was
said
at
the
conclusion
of
a
voir
dire
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
where
there
had
been
testimony
by
mr.
johnson
that
he
was
beaten
by
the
police
and
testimony
by
a
succession
of
policemen
who
were
present
that
they
had
not
beaten
mr.
johnson.
on
that
point,
there
is
the
sharpest
conflict
of
testimony.
at
the
con
--
and
after
getting
the
defendant's
contention
with
that
position
at
the
end
of
the
voir
dire
and
indeed
it's
been
also
about
at
the
beginning
of
the
voir
dire.
the
court
said,
"i
am
not
satisfied
from
the
evidence
that
it
was
not
freely
and
competently
given
and
therefore
i
rule
that
it
is
admissible".
so
that
obviously
at
the
trial
that
on
the
sole
focus
of
the
question
of
voluntariness
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
physical
beating.
then,
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
after
the
escobedo
case,
the
determination
of
that
and
it
was
in
a
sense
a
non-determination,
the
motion
was
denied
where
their
remark
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
questions
raised
were
more
--
were
in
any
event
more
properly,
those
decided
by
the
supreme
court
but
the
focus
of
the
court's
attention,
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
i
misspoke
myself.
the
focus
of
the
court's
contention
was
plainly
on
the
counsel
question
and
not
the
voluntariness
question
as
such.
i
think
this
appears
perfectly
plainly
and
here
again,
i
can
do
no
better
than
read
from
the
record.
i
really
couldn't
paraphrase
as
well
and
there's
a
sentence
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
329.
i
find
his
willingness
to
talk
to
lieutenant
donovan
at
this
time,
in
6:00,
was
not
a
waiver
of
any
right
in
quotes.
he
had
to
remain
silent
and
to
refuse
to
talk
to
the
police
at
that
time
or
to
be
cautioned
by
the
police
at
that
time
of
such
"rights”
if
it
should
be
determined
that
in
the
circumstances
he
had
any
one
or
all
of
such
"rights".
and
the
focus
is
quite
plainly
on
the
relationship
of
warning
rights
and
counsel.
in
that
posture
of
events
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
which
essentially
said
that
the
determination
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
one
of
fact
and
the
trial
judge
had
so
determined
and
that
essentially
was
it.
they
said
also
that
the
--
it
was
incumbent
upon
counsel
below
at
the
trial
to
have
raised
the
other
contentions
with
respect
to
involuntariness
that
were
then
raised
before
them.
and
then
he
said
that
in
any
event
when
the
trial
judge
and
it
was
of
course
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
motion
for
new
trial
in
accordance
with
the
massachusetts
unusual
practice
that
in
any
event
he
must
have
had
all
these
factors
in
mind
when
he
denied
the
motion
for
the
new
trial.
i
suggest
that
in
the
light
of
the
judge's
meticulous
findings,
rulings
and
orders
after
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
i've
been
reading
from
that
that
is
really
not
quite
wrong.
now,
the
--
this
tunnel
vision
of
the
massachusetts
courts
with
respect
to
the
criteria
to
be
considered
on
the
voluntary
issue
in
this
case
is
i
suggest
accounted
for
by
the
rule
which
was
plainly
applied
by
the
massachusetts
court
and
fourth,
rightly
stated
to
be
the
role
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
and
that
rule
which
was
applied
and
which
was
enunciated
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
involuntariness
is
upon
the
defendant.
that
statement
follows
the
assertion
which
has
been
variously
phrased
that
the
confession
when
introduced
is
prima
facie
voluntary
or
as
presumptively
voluntary,
that
of
course
explains
the
double
negative
in
the
judge's
ruling
which
i
explained
and
given
that
rule
which
this
judge
as
a
massachusetts
judge
was
bound
to
follow.
it
follows
that
it
was
entirely
proper
for
him
to
query
closely
trial
counsel
as
to
the
precise
ground
of
involuntariness
in
this
spectrum
or
in
this
criteria
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
he
did
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
you're
quite
right,
this
is
the
point
i'm
making.
that
the
judge
did
that
as
a
massachusetts
trial
judge
but
i
--
my
point
is
--
the
point
which
i
urged
is
that
he
should
do
that.
should
not
be
constitutionally
sanctioned
by
this
court
because
he
does
that,
because
the
--
under
the
massachusetts
rule
which
i
asked
at
least
--
of
this
rule
applied
in
massachusetts
which
i
have
here
now
asking
to
be
stricken
down,
is
that
the
confession,
even
as
--
in
this
case
a
--
an
in
custody
confession
is
presumed
to
be
voluntary
or
is
prima
facie
voluntary
with
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
--
what
i'm
urging
is
that
the
burden
is
the
wrong
way
around.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
the
burden
of
proof
are
both
in
the
mass
--
under
the
cases
enunciated
in
massachusetts.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
teaching
to
be
derived
from
the
cases
of
this
court
and
i
say
that
for
several
reasons
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
should
--
i
would
say
your
honor,
the
trial
counsel
representing
a
defendant
could
stipulate
that
the
confession
make
a
--
a
written
stipulation
or
a
stipulation
in
an
honorable
court
that
a
confession
was
voluntary
or
that
he
could
waive
i
suppose.
well,
a
stipulation
would
be
what
i
would
suggest
but
if
he
makes
the
objection
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
but
i
suggest
that
if
he
raises
any
question
with
respect
to
it's
being
a
voluntary
confession
that
the
--
if
he
objects
at
all,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prosecution
as
it
is
in
the
federal
courts.
and
as
it
is
in
all
but
seven
as
i
understand
the
law
of
the
50
states
that
the
burden
is
the
government's
to
show
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
not
the
other
way
around
that
it
is
for
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
is
involuntary.
i
suggest
that
this
should
be
--
did
i
urge
that
this
be
the
constitutional
rule?
not
nearly
as
a
manner
that
a
majority
rule
is
better
than
a
minority
rule
are
not
because
this
is
solely
because
this
case
demonstrates
the
problems
which
i've
created
for
a
defendant
when
the
rule
as
is
the
massachusetts'
rule
is
stated.
i
don't
urge
it
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
they
object.
they
say
this
is
involuntary.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
without
the
aid
of
any
presumption.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
procedure
should
be
the
procedure
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
i
would
go
further
and
say
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
on
the
bases
of
the
presumption
of
the
prima
facie
it
would
come
in.
and
so
in
this
case
the
defendant
because
he
was
the
only
witness
who
could
take
the
stand
and
as
the
record
shows
the
defendant
then
was
put
on
to
stand
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
he
testified
as
to
these
series
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
and
then
after
that
the
officers
came
in
and
severally
testified
that
what
he
--
then
of
course,
it
was
consisted
with
that
the
assistant
attorney
or
the
district
attorney
would
try
and
cross
examine
johnson.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
rogers
and
richmond
was
where
the
criteria
were
held
to
be
incorrect
because
what
the
connecticut
court
had
down
there
was
say
that
the
determination
of
voluntariness
was
really
related
to
truthfulness.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
and
this
court
had
said,
that
cannot
be
because
that
is
an
improper
criterion.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
now,
--
well,
i
suggest
that
there
are.i
suggest
that
there
are
foreshadowing's
of
what
i
asked
today
in
the
cases.
certainly
in
miranda,
the
burdens
with
--
the
burden
with
respect
to
the
requirements
there
of
warning,
an
opportunity
for
counsel
had
been
in
the
squarest
fashion
placed
upon
the
prosecution.
i
also
suggest
that
this
burden
is
in
a
sense
foreshadowed
in
miranda
where
it
says
that
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
confession
are
the
same
in
the
federal
and
the
state
procedure
in
footnote
33
and
the
federal
procedure
are
just
as
plain
as
they
ever
since
graham
that
there
the
burden
is
on
the
federal
government.
now,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
reading
of
bram
which
is
a
long
case
is
one
that
carries
with
it,
as
i
remember
it
carries
with
it
some
fifth
amendment
implications
and
i
think
it
also
--
bram
could
fairly
be
stated
to
said
to
derive
from
the
--
perhaps
a
parallel
it's
even
better
than
parallel
almost
an
on
and
on
evidentiary
development
which
had
existed
in
the
english
common
law
and
indeed
in
this
country.
in
fact
in
my
own
state,
the
cases
are
on
the
turn
of
the
century
if
you
said
to
a
man,
you
better
confess,
you
better
owe
that,
well
because
if
you
said,
you
would
confess
that
clearly
spoil
it.
if
you
said
to
him,
you
better
own
that
was
an
involuntary
confession
if
you
said
to
him,
you
better
tell
the
truth
it
made
it
a
closed
question.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
mr.--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
by
that
judgment,
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
which
imposed
the
death
penalty
on
ronald
johnson,
the
petitioner
here.
the
trial
court
imposed
the
death
penalty
following
johnson's
conviction
by
a
jury
of
first
degree
murder.
the
issues
which
this
case
brings
here
arise
out
of
the
use
at
trial
of
a
question
and
answer
statement
amounting
to
a
confession
which
was
used
over
objection.
those
issues
--
first,
as
to
whether
on
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
that
confession
could've
been
determined
to
be
voluntary
or
conversely
must
be
declared
to
be
involuntary.
and
the
other
issues
which
arise
with
respect
to
that
confession,
i
would
respect
to
the
procedures
used
by
the
massachusetts
courts
with
respect
to
that
confession.
addressing
myself
first
to
the
first
issue
i
mentioned,
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
are
as
follows:
the
petitioner
johnson
was
taken
into
custody
at
approximately
9:30
pm
on
the
evening
of
august
1st,
1963.
immediately
prior
to
his
being
taken
into
custody
he
had
been
the
object
of
a
pursuit.
the
shooting
for
which
he
was
subsequently
indicted
had
occurred
at
approximately
9:00
pm
of
that
evening.
johnson
was
pursued
in
the
car
which
he
was
driving
by
several
--
by
succession
indeed
of
police
vehicles.
and
the
car
he
was
driving
was
then
in
a
collision
with
a
bus.
johnson
emerged
from
that
car
on
foot
and
after
a
relatively
brief
foot
pursuit
he
was
apprehended
under
a
porch
and
brought
by
policemen
to
a
police
box
and
that's
in
a
police
car
to
the
local
station
house
in
the
district
of
boston
known
as
roxbury.
there,
johnson
was
booked
and
he
was
booked
amid
circumstances
which
the
trial
judge
found
were
attended
by
confusion,
turmoil
and
strain.
he
was
plainly
injured
at
the
time,
there's
no
question
that
he
was
bleeding
on
the
head
and
around
the
neck
at
the
time
he
was
booked.
he
was
then
placed
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
don't
know.
he
--
there
was
a
collision
with
a
bus.
he
emerged
from
the
car
which
was
badly
damaged,
no
question
to
that,
but
i
don't
know
as
to
--
i
make
no
contention
either
way
on
this,
i
--
but
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
it
was
clear
in
the
record.
it
merely
was
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
bleeding
and
was
injured
at
that
time.
he
was
placed
in
a
cell
and
he
was
given
some
first
aid,
this
at
the
local
station
house.
and
at
the
local
station
house
occurred
the
first
of
several
confrontations.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
oh,
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
on
this
but
it
would've
been
inevitable
between
9
--
he
was
booked
at
9:35.
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
9:30;
he
was
booked
at
9:35
on
suspicion
of
murder.
he
was
taken
down
to
the
police
headquarters
which
is
five
miles
away,
sometime
around
midnight,
so
that,
the
first
of
these
confrontations,
there
maybe
a
record
time
on
it
but
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
search
it
out,
it
was
in
this
interlude.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
essentially
first
aid,
a
doctor
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
a
doctor.
a
doctor
and
a
--
the
cut
was
cleaned
off
and
a
--
some
--
a
bandage
put
on
it.
and
then
this
confrontation
was
conducted
by
a
lieutenant
donovan
who
was
the
officer
in-charged
of
these
proceedings
throughout
the
rest
of
the
night.
and
it
consisted
of
being
a
--
johnson
being
identified
by
a
witness
and
a
little
colloquy
of
an
equivocal
nature
and
it
be
--
that
colloquy
being
recorded
by
a
police
stenographer
who
was
there,
who
was
not
identified
to
johnson
as
such.
i
state
at
this
point
that
it's
perfectly
clear
and
there's
no
dispute
about
this
that
at
no
time
during
the
evening
up
until
this
question
and
answer
confession
which
occurred
at
6
o'clock,
had
at
no
time
in
the
custody
of
the
police
was
johnson
warned
that
he
might
be
silent,
that
anything
he
would
--
said
would
be
used
against
him
or
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
better
put
it
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court
who
was
--
said
it
quite
plainly
on
his
--
on
some
findings
which
appear
at
page
2
--
329
of
the
record.
no
police
officer
told
the
defendant
at
any
time
from
the
time
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
the
rear
of
20
fernwood
road
until
he
had
completed
his
statement
to
lieutenant
donovan
that
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
put
to
him
by
the
police
or
that
anything
he
said
to
the
police
might
or
could
be
used
against
him.
so,
that
is
clear
as
throughout
the
evening.
after
--
at
some
point
after
this
confrontation
as
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
august
1st,
1963
prior
of
course
to
the
escobedo
decision
and
prior
to
the
--
of
course,
obviously
the
miranda
ruling.
the
--
johnson
was
then
taken
on
approximately
midnight
to
police
headquarters.
and
there
he
was
placed
in
several
lineups
throughout
the
evening.
he
was
by
himself.
there
were
--
as
the
record
shows
a
very
large
number
of
policemen
been
involved
in
these
proceedings
of
the
order
of
--
that
at
least
50
and
to
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that
was
somewhat
before
midnight,
it's
actually
station
10.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
then
the
line
ups
are
between
midnight
and
4:30.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
the
procedure
--
there's
just
no
dispute
about
this
that
the
procedure
in
the
lineups
wasn't
on
a
number
of
occasions,
a
witness
would
confront
johnson
and
say
something
to
him,
johnson
would
make
some
sort
of
an
equivocal
reply.
it
would
be
taken
down
on
this
--
there
was
another
stenographer,
they
were
two
of
them
who
testified
in
this
regard.
and
it
would
be
taken
down
and
the
stenographer
was
not
unidentified
to
just
in
these
confrontations.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
the
trial
judge
found
they
were
four.
i
found
two
on
the
record
but
i
can
say
that
because
mr.
concannon,
my
brother
has
said
to
the
trial
judge
found
they
were
four.
they
were
--
of
that
order.
and
some
might
--
there
might
have
been
three.
there
was
a
little
confusion
about
that
if
they
had
--
there
could've
been
four.
you
could
say
they
were
two
but
in
any
event
it
was
of
that
order.
and
the
witnesses
who
identified
johnson
or
some
of
the
witnesses
who
identified
johnson
and
there
were
several,
testified
that
a
--
as
he
appeared
in
the
lineup,
blood
appeared
on
various
parts
of
his
body,
some
on
his
head,
some
on
his
legs,
his
clothing
was
tattered
and
torn.
so
that
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
without
dispute
that
through
the
evening
there
was
still
observation
of
bleeding
and
bruise,
some
injury.
with
respect
to
the
injury
it's
also
clear
that
two
weeks
after
the
confession,
johnson
was
operated
on
for
a
condition
called
a
subdural
hematoma
which
is
a
collection
of
blood
between
the
dura
and
the
brain
and
that
condition
was
relieved.
and
the
record
goes
as
five
but
no
further
than
--
that
it
was
that
condition
was
consistent
with
having
been
there
two
weeks.
which
goes
takes
it
back
to
the
time
of
this
confession.
then
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning,
approximately,
in
a
room
in
police
headquarters,
the
statement
was
taken
by
a
police
stenographer,
the
only
persons
present
were
policemen.
and
the
statement
was
in
question
and
answers
form
and
as
i
believe
will
be
apparent
upon
the
slightest
reading
of
it.
it
is
a
catalog
of
the
prima
facie
elements
of
each
of
the
crimes
so
which
johnson
was
indicted
four
days
later
to
wit
--
murder
in
the
first
degree,
armed
robbery
while
masked,
assault
and
battery
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
carrying
of
a
revolver
without
a
license
and
carrying
of
a
revolver
in
a
vehicle
without
a
license.
and
the
q
&
a
goes
right
down
each
of
the
elements
goes
through
the
license
and
all
of
that.
it
further
appears
that
johnson
was
an
unemployed
man
of
--
with
an
iq
that
was
taken
by
the
state
in
the
proceedings
under
the
so-called
briggs
law.
with
an
iq
of
86
and
education
that
pitted
out
somewhere
when
he
was
16
years
old,
he
certainly
didn't
get
beyond
the
eight
grade,
he
might
have
been
still
on
the
sixth
grade
in
special
classes.
the
--
his
answers
to
the
examining
people
are
not
entirely
clear
but
at
16
he
quit
school
and
he
was
either
on
a
special
eight
grade
or
a
sixth
grade,
one
of
the
two.
i
think
i
urged
your
honors
that
on
this
recitation
of
the
facts,
the
facts
very
largely
speak
for
themselves.
here,
we
plainly
have
a
citizen
who
was
injured,
was
disadvantaged
in
this
intellect,
in
his
education
who
was
the
subject
of
a
process
which
to
use
the
colloquial
terms,
box
him
in
by
the
confrontations
in
the
interrogations.
and
then
in
our
atmosphere
it
is
unquestionably
police
dominated
and
without
warning
advice
or
counsel
or
friend
or
adviser,
he
gives
a
question
and
answer
statement
which
is
a
catalog
of
the
prima
facie
elements
of
these
crimes.
quite
plainly,
this
was
in
no
sense
an
attempt
to
find
out
what
had
happened.
it
was
a
procedure
to
wrap
up
the
case.
the
trial
judge
found
that
at
the
time
of
the
confession,
johnson
was
the
prime
suspect
in
the
felonious
homicide
of
james
b.
o'leary
who
was
the
victim
of
the
shooting.
now
the
--
i
am
not
going
to
contend
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
no
i
was
not.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
came
into
this
case
shortly
prior
to
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
was
filed
following
the
decision
in
escobedo.
my
appointment
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
the
--
there
was
an
objection
to
this
confession
and
i
will
come
to
that
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
in
a
moment
your
honor.
by
--
but
there
was
an
objection
it
came
in
clearly
over
objection,
there's
no
question
of
that.
but
not
--
the
objection
was
not
as
i
will
point
out,
not
based
on
all
of
these
reasons
i
assert.
but
it
is
perfectly
quite
plain
that
each
of
these
items
that
i
speak
of
have
their
reflections
in
decided
cases
of
this
court
which
have
held
confessions
to
be
as
a
matter
of
law
and
upon
review
by
this
court
involuntary.
those
cases
reflect
--
it
has
been
said
a
number
of
values
which
come
together.
and
i
urge
that
the
very
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case
shows
that
this
is
a
case
which
reflects
all
of
those
values
which
have
caused
this
court
to
proscribe
the
use
of
a
confession
in
these
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
a
curious
use
of
language
to
call
an
act
performed
and
i
--
by
act
i
mean
the
confession
performed
in
these
circumstances
by
such
a
person,
taking
them
all
together.
i
suggest
that
as
a
curious
use
of
language
to
call
it
voluntary.
and
that
--
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
doctrines
which
those
cases
exemplify
call
upon
this
court
upon
its
review
of
these
facts
not
in
dispute
to
declare
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
unless
infected
the
conviction
with
a
fatal
invalidity.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
yes
very
much
so.
a
part
from
the
dominance
i
put
my
finger
very
strongly
on
the
practice
of
having
johnson
confronted
by
a
witness
and
the
response
being
--
and
then
a
response
which
is
equivocal.
the
law
of
massachusetts
being
that
a
person
in
custody
of
course,
his
silence
cannot
be
used
against
him.
his
denial
cannot
be
used
against
him,
but
an
equivocal
statement
can
be
used
against
him.
its
--
in
a
response
such
as
this
which
appears
on
the
record.
if
he
was
a
long
way
from
the
car,
how
did
he
spot
me?
this
--
a
response
to
the
officer
in
the
light
of
an
identification.
now,
that's
has
its
echo
in
a
very
old
case
which
your
honors
may
well
remember
in
brown
versus
the
united
states
that
make
who
was
called
in
and
that
was
the
--
a
lead
of
course
as
we
all
know,
like
lead
case
for
the
federal
courts.
if
he
was
standing
on
that
place
on
the
deck,
how
did
he
see
me?
and
those
are
the
--
that
is
i
suggest
the
purpose
of
that
kind
of
a
confrontation
recorded
mind
you,
recorded
not
surreptitiously.
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
reporter
was
--
police
reporter
was
there
with
a
notebook
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
what
i'm
complaining
about
not
--
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
fact
that
the
witness
identified
but
what
i
am
complaining
about
on
mr.
johnson's
behalf
is
that
that
procedure
where
johnson
without
counsel,
without
advise,
an
ignorant
man
was
put
in
that
position
where
--
whether
or
not
he
came
through
with
the
q
&
a
at
6
o'clock.
a
lot
of
mileage
had
been
made.
before
6
o'clock
on
that
man
without
a
q
&
a
and
it
was
all
down
there
that
this
was
not
idle
conversation.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
police
were
doing
an
efficient
wrap
up
job
here.
they
didn't
have
the
stenographer
their
to
treasure
the
pros,
i
mean
they
had
a
reason
for
it
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
that
police
action
not
of
itself
but
with
all
these
other
factors.
for
instance,
in
spano
this
court
gave
considerable
weight
to
the
undeviating
purpose
of
the
officers
to
produce
the
confession.
the
--
there
and
spano
was
--
is
the
lead
one
but
there
are
other
cases
where
the
--
where
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
police
were
proceeding
to
a
wrap
up
procedure
was
a
factor
which
this
court
gave
weight
in
all
the
circumstances
on
the
question
of
whether
this
court
would
deem
the
confessions
to
be
invalid.
now,
i
hope
--
i'd
like
not
to
tell
you
on
this
point
fundamental
as
it
is
to
my
position
because
i
now
want
to
come
to
the
procedures
which
i
--
which
are
quite
a
separate
point
and
do
not
in
any
sense
depend
nor
does
the
point
i
have
just
made
depend
on
them.
my
first
point
is
that
the
courts
in
massachusetts
never
in
their
procedure
gave
consideration
to
this
issue
with
the
range
of
criteria
which
this
court
requires.
i
don't
need
to
argue
that
this
court
has
said
that
these
items
i
have
argued
about
of
the
mental
and
educational
condition
of
the
defendant,
his
injuries,
his
custodial
isolation,
his
warnings
or
lack
of
warning,
are
the
criteria
which
must
be
considered
on
this
question.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
argue
either
that
the
courts
below
must
pay
he
to
the
criteria
set
down
by
this
court
in
making
that
determination.
i
scarcely
need
to
argue
that
in
this
case,
the
massachusetts
courts
did
not
give
consideration
to
that
broad
range
of
criteria,
to
that
increasingly
meticulous
test
which
--
as
was
said
in
one
of
the
recent
cases
of
this
court.
i'll
come
to
the
reason
why,
which
is
my
third
point,
but
i
thought
that
an
orderly
presentation
would
require
establishing
this
point
that
they
did
not
first.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
that
the
trial
court
at
the
trial
itself
did
not
--
considered
only
one
aspect
and
that
appears
and
i
can
only
do
this
--
i
can
do
this
best
by
reading
it
at
page
189
where
the
trial
justice
said
to
the
then
defense
counsel,
the
contention
of
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it
is
that,
and
there's
a
typographical
error,
is
that
the
statement
was
involuntarily
given
because
of
physical
force
applied
to
the
defendant
by
the
police
so
that
the
statement
was
coerced
from
him.
that
is
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
the
defendant
takes
is
that
correct
mr.
colloquo
(ph)?
mr.
colloquo
(ph):
"that
is
correct
your
honor".
this
was
said
at
the
conclusion
of
a
voir
dire
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
where
there
had
been
testimony
by
mr.
johnson
that
he
was
beaten
by
the
police
and
testimony
by
a
succession
of
policemen
who
were
present
that
they
had
not
beaten
mr.
johnson.
on
that
point,
there
is
the
sharpest
conflict
of
testimony.
at
the
con
--
and
after
getting
the
defendant's
contention
with
that
position
at
the
end
of
the
voir
dire
and
indeed
it's
been
also
about
at
the
beginning
of
the
voir
dire.
the
court
said,
"i
am
not
satisfied
from
the
evidence
that
it
was
not
freely
and
competently
given
and
therefore
i
rule
that
it
is
admissible".
so
that
obviously
at
the
trial
that
on
the
sole
focus
of
the
question
of
voluntariness
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
physical
beating.
then,
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
after
the
escobedo
case,
the
determination
of
that
and
it
was
in
a
sense
a
non-determination,
the
motion
was
denied
where
their
remark
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
questions
raised
were
more
--
were
in
any
event
more
properly,
those
decided
by
the
supreme
court
but
the
focus
of
the
court's
attention,
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
i
misspoke
myself.
the
focus
of
the
court's
contention
was
plainly
on
the
counsel
question
and
not
the
voluntariness
question
as
such.
i
think
this
appears
perfectly
plainly
and
here
again,
i
can
do
no
better
than
read
from
the
record.
i
really
couldn't
paraphrase
as
well
and
there's
a
sentence
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
329.
i
find
his
willingness
to
talk
to
lieutenant
donovan
at
this
time,
in
6:00,
was
not
a
waiver
of
any
right
in
quotes.
he
had
to
remain
silent
and
to
refuse
to
talk
to
the
police
at
that
time
or
to
be
cautioned
by
the
police
at
that
time
of
such
"rights”
if
it
should
be
determined
that
in
the
circumstances
he
had
any
one
or
all
of
such
"rights".
and
the
focus
is
quite
plainly
on
the
relationship
of
warning
rights
and
counsel.
in
that
posture
of
events
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
which
essentially
said
that
the
determination
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
one
of
fact
and
the
trial
judge
had
so
determined
and
that
essentially
was
it.
they
said
also
that
the
--
it
was
incumbent
upon
counsel
below
at
the
trial
to
have
raised
the
other
contentions
with
respect
to
involuntariness
that
were
then
raised
before
them.
and
then
he
said
that
in
any
event
when
the
trial
judge
and
it
was
of
course
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
motion
for
new
trial
in
accordance
with
the
massachusetts
unusual
practice
that
in
any
event
he
must
have
had
all
these
factors
in
mind
when
he
denied
the
motion
for
the
new
trial.
i
suggest
that
in
the
light
of
the
judge's
meticulous
findings,
rulings
and
orders
after
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
i've
been
reading
from
that
that
is
really
not
quite
wrong.
now,
the
--
this
tunnel
vision
of
the
massachusetts
courts
with
respect
to
the
criteria
to
be
considered
on
the
voluntary
issue
in
this
case
is
i
suggest
accounted
for
by
the
rule
which
was
plainly
applied
by
the
massachusetts
court
and
fourth,
rightly
stated
to
be
the
role
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
and
that
rule
which
was
applied
and
which
was
enunciated
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
involuntariness
is
upon
the
defendant.
that
statement
follows
the
assertion
which
has
been
variously
phrased
that
the
confession
when
introduced
is
prima
facie
voluntary
or
as
presumptively
voluntary,
that
of
course
explains
the
double
negative
in
the
judge's
ruling
which
i
explained
and
given
that
rule
which
this
judge
as
a
massachusetts
judge
was
bound
to
follow.
it
follows
that
it
was
entirely
proper
for
him
to
query
closely
trial
counsel
as
to
the
precise
ground
of
involuntariness
in
this
spectrum
or
in
this
criteria
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
he
did
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
you're
quite
right,
this
is
the
point
i'm
making.
that
the
judge
did
that
as
a
massachusetts
trial
judge
but
i
--
my
point
is
--
the
point
which
i
urged
is
that
he
should
do
that.
should
not
be
constitutionally
sanctioned
by
this
court
because
he
does
that,
because
the
--
under
the
massachusetts
rule
which
i
asked
at
least
--
of
this
rule
applied
in
massachusetts
which
i
have
here
now
asking
to
be
stricken
down,
is
that
the
confession,
even
as
--
in
this
case
a
--
an
in
custody
confession
is
presumed
to
be
voluntary
or
is
prima
facie
voluntary
with
the
burden
on
the
defendant.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
--
what
i'm
urging
is
that
the
burden
is
the
wrong
way
around.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
the
burden
of
proof
are
both
in
the
mass
--
under
the
cases
enunciated
in
massachusetts.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
teaching
to
be
derived
from
the
cases
of
this
court
and
i
say
that
for
several
reasons
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
should
--
i
would
say
your
honor,
the
trial
counsel
representing
a
defendant
could
stipulate
that
the
confession
make
a
--
a
written
stipulation
or
a
stipulation
in
an
honorable
court
that
a
confession
was
voluntary
or
that
he
could
waive
i
suppose.
well,
a
stipulation
would
be
what
i
would
suggest
but
if
he
makes
the
objection
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
but
i
suggest
that
if
he
raises
any
question
with
respect
to
it's
being
a
voluntary
confession
that
the
--
if
he
objects
at
all,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prosecution
as
it
is
in
the
federal
courts.
and
as
it
is
in
all
but
seven
as
i
understand
the
law
of
the
50
states
that
the
burden
is
the
government's
to
show
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
not
the
other
way
around
that
it
is
for
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
is
involuntary.
i
suggest
that
this
should
be
--
did
i
urge
that
this
be
the
constitutional
rule?
not
nearly
as
a
manner
that
a
majority
rule
is
better
than
a
minority
rule
are
not
because
this
is
solely
because
this
case
demonstrates
the
problems
which
i've
created
for
a
defendant
when
the
rule
as
is
the
massachusetts'
rule
is
stated.
i
don't
urge
it
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
they
object.
they
say
this
is
involuntary.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
without
the
aid
of
any
presumption.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
procedure
should
be
the
procedure
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
i
would
go
further
and
say
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
on
the
bases
of
the
presumption
of
the
prima
facie
it
would
come
in.
and
so
in
this
case
the
defendant
because
he
was
the
only
witness
who
could
take
the
stand
and
as
the
record
shows
the
defendant
then
was
put
on
to
stand
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
he
testified
as
to
these
series
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
and
then
after
that
the
officers
came
in
and
severally
testified
that
what
he
--
then
of
course,
it
was
consisted
with
that
the
assistant
attorney
or
the
district
attorney
would
try
and
cross
examine
johnson.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
rogers
and
richmond
was
where
the
criteria
were
held
to
be
incorrect
because
what
the
connecticut
court
had
down
there
was
say
that
the
determination
of
voluntariness
was
really
related
to
truthfulness.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
and
this
court
had
said,
that
cannot
be
because
that
is
an
improper
criterion.
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
now,
--
well,
i
suggest
that
there
are.i
suggest
that
there
are
foreshadowing's
of
what
i
asked
today
in
the
cases.
certainly
in
miranda,
the
burdens
with
--
the
burden
with
respect
to
the
requirements
there
of
warning,
an
opportunity
for
counsel
had
been
in
the
squarest
fashion
placed
upon
the
prosecution.
i
also
suggest
that
this
burden
is
in
a
sense
foreshadowed
in
miranda
where
it
says
that
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
confession
are
the
same
in
the
federal
and
the
state
procedure
in
footnote
33
and
the
federal
procedure
are
just
as
plain
as
they
ever
since
graham
that
there
the
burden
is
on
the
federal
government.
now,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
john
m.
harrington,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
reading
of
bram
which
is
a
long
case
is
one
that
carries
with
it,
as
i
remember
it
carries
with
it
some
fifth
amendment
implications
and
i
think
it
also
--
bram
could
fairly
be
stated
to
said
to
derive
from
the
--
perhaps
a
parallel
it's
even
better
than
parallel
almost
an
on
and
on
evidentiary
development
which
had
existed
in
the
english
common
law
and
indeed
in
this
country.
in
fact
in
my
own
state,
the
cases
are
on
the
turn
of
the
century
if
you
said
to
a
man,
you
better
confess,
you
better
owe
that,
well
because
if
you
said,
you
would
confess
that
clearly
spoil
it.
if
you
said
to
him,
you
better
own
that
was
an
involuntary
confession
if
you
said
to
him,
you
better
tell
the
truth
it
made
it
a
closed
question.
