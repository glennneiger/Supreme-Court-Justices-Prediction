mr.
brian
concannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
confession
here
was
a
voluntary
one.
there's
no
question
before
this
court
as
to
the
physical
coercion
that
was
found
as
a
fact
not
to
be
served
by
the
trial
judge.
whether
or
not
there
was
psychological
coercion
is
to
be
determined
by
balancing
the
circumstances
of
pressure
against
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
that
pressure.
the
circumstances
of
pressure
were
delineated
by
my
brother.
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
in
this
case
is
as
follows.
this
was
a
29-year
old
man.
he
had
been
to
the
eighth
grade
or
in
any
event
had
attended
junior
high
school,
his
iq
measured
under
less
than
ideal
circumstances
was
86
in
the
dull,
normal
range.
he
had
experienced
in
the
military
service
as
a
(inaudible)
guard
and
as
defendant.
he
had
significant
experience
with
the
police
with
regard
to
arrests
and
interrogations
for
violations,
alleged
violations
of
motor
vehicle
law,
public
utility
law,
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
armed
robbery,
disorderly
conduct
and
homicide.
one
of
those
investigations
involved
a
5-hour
custodial
interrogation.
whatever
deficiency
if
indeed
there
was
a
deficiency
in
this
man’s
iq
as
theoretically
measured
should
be
more
than
out
waived
by
his
practical
intelligence
and
by
his
sophistication
in
dealing
with
the
police
as
a
result
of
his
experience.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
left
the
service
under
it
was
not
an
honorable
discharge.
i
believe
that
it
was
as
a
result
of
not
--
i
think
it
was
inefficiency.
he
was
not
able
to
perform
i
think
it
had
something
to
do
with
his
intelligence.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
on
this
occasion
in
question
and
on
every
other
occasion
which
he
had
dealings
with
the
police
this
man
was
not
done
as
to
his
rights.
his
statements
to
the
police
on
this
occasion
and
on
other
occasions
negative
it
seems
to
me
the
aspect
of
an
ignorant
individual
who
was
being
intimidated
by
the
police.
the
record
is
abundant
with
his
asseverations
to
the
police.
i
don’t
have
to
make
a
call
i
don’t
have
to
tell
you
cops
anything.
i
know
my
rights.
in
addition
to
the
spectacle
of
cross
examining
his
accuses
at
the
time
of
these
confrontations
and
lineups
are
you
sure
that
i'm
the
person,
did
you
see
me
shoot
the
cop.
if
there
were
10
called
on
the
lineup
could
you
have
picked
me
out?
mr.
brian
concannon
he
certainly
was
not
as
efficient
mr.
justice
marshall
as
a
trial
lawyer.
but
i
mentioned
his
activity
in
cross
examining
his
accusers
to
point
out
not
that
he
did
not
need
a
lawyer
but
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
individual
that
appears
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
showing
--
deciding
involuntariness.
in
no
case
this
court
has
decided
do
we
have
a
finding
on
involuntariness
in
such
circumstances
as
these.
certainly
not
--
no
case
has
gone
this
far
with
regard
to
the
coercive
pressures
and
no
case
has
gone
this
far
with
regard
to
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
and
it’s
for
that
purpose
only
that
i
mentioned
it.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
questioned
for
information.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
questioned
for
information.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
that
may
have
been
on
the
minds
of
the
police
your
honor
yes.
but
this
was
not
the
kind
of
case
showing
an
unyielding
contrivance
against
this
man
because
--
mr.
brian
concannon
it’s
not
the
practice
today
your
honor.
whether
it’s
normal,
according
to
the
police
procedures
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor
this
was
a
killing
of
policeman
that
occurred
in
the
early
evening.
he
was
brought
to
the
station
and
the
police
were
very
anxious
to
know
as
much
about
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
could
find
out.
there
were
witnesses,
they
were
brought
both
to
the
headquarters,
they
were
brought
to
station
10.
mr.
brian
concannon
i'm
not
sure
i
would
go
that
far
but
i
would
say
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
brian
concannon
and
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
although
i'm
speaking
off
the
record
that
the
police
were
interested
in
getting
a
statement
from
this
man.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
that’s
always
the
purpose
behind
getting
a
statement
from
quite
candidly
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
not
argue
that
your
honor.
there's
no
question—
mr.
brian
concannon
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer
and
if
the
case
were
to
take
place
today—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
a
little
bit
if
i
may.
mr.
brian
concannon
--caused
by
the
activity
of
the
petitioner
himself.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
this
was
a
finding
of
-
created
partially
yes
--
this
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
lieutenant
richardson
warned
this
man
at
the
booking
desk
pursuant
to
massachusetts
law
that
he
had
the
right
to
call
a
lawyer,
a
bail
commissioner,
a
friend
or
a
relative.
the
trial
judge
found
as
a
fact
that
this
warning
was
not
completely
communicated
to
the
petitioner,
partly
due
to
the
confusion
in
the
police
station
partly
due
to
the
obstreperous
conduct
of
the
petitioner
himself.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
this
questioning
was
not
constant
questioning,
giving
the
greatest
leeway
to
the
interpretation
of
the
record
that
we
point
out
in
footnote
10
of
our
brief.
this
man
could
not
have
been
questioned
for
more
than
two-and-a-half
hours
at
most.
but
i
agree
with
your
honor
to
this
extent
that
this
is
conduct
which
is
impermissible
by
today’s
standards
but
we’re
talking
about
pre-miranda
cases.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor,
perhaps
i
can
shortcut
it
for
you.
we
concede
that
this
was
a
police
dominated
atmosphere.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
brought
to
station
10.
there
were
many
policemen
around
at
the
booking
desk.
he
was
struggling
at
that
time
so
there
were
policeman
needed
to
restrain
him.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
there
was
--
at
the
booking
desk
i'm
not
sure
--
i
think
the
record
would
indicated
that
in
the
immediate
vicinity
there
was
about
a
half
dozen
policemen.
mr.
brian
concannon
then
he
was
given
medical
attention
and
put
in
a
cell
and
these
facts
were
not
fully
developed
for
the
simple
reason
that
at
trial,
he
claimed
that
he
was
being
beaten
all
the
time.
the
judge
disbelieved
this.
this
opacity
of
facts
as
to
just
how
many
policemen
were
around.
there
were
many
dozens
of
policeman
that
came
to
the
court
to
testify
so
that
at
various
times
during
the
night
he
was
in
the
presence
of
more
than
a
hundred
policemen.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
record
indicates
that
only
lieutenant
donovan
conducted
the
interrogation.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
lieutenant
richardson
warned
him—attempted
to
warn
him
of
his
rights
to
call
a
lawyer.
as
far
as
the
record
bears
out
i
believe
that
lieutenant
donovan
was
the
only
one
who
interrogated
him.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
i
don’t
believe
that’s
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
record
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
testimony
of
course
went
much
further
for
the
defendant
that
he
was
beaten
by
the
policeman
but
this
was
disapproved.
mr.
brian
concannon
at
the
time
of
the
lineups
there
were
over
a
hundred
policemen
sitting
back
watching
the
lineup
only
lieutenant
donovan
as
my
brother
pointed
out
questioned
him
at
that
time.
there
was
a
stenographer
present
who
said
nothing,
nearly
took
down
what
was
said.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
this
was
a
large
city,
the
city
of
boston
your
honor
and
there
were
many
lineups
during
the
night
--
not
only
in
connection
with
this
individual
but
many
others.
the
policeman—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
this
was
the
headquarters
not
the
police
precinct.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
they
were
doing
it
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
serious
crime
and
there
were
many
serious
crimes
committed
around
this
time.
i
don’t
know
if
there
were
many
committed
on
that
evening
but
the
record
doesn’t
indicate
and
i
don’t
know
whether
all
the
policemen
were
here
for
this
case
or
not.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor
that’s
correct.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
an
accurate
statement
and
if
i
may
elaborate
upon
i
think—
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
perfectly
accurate.
more
than
that
there
was
a
bench
conference
at
which
the
attorneys
discussed
with
the
judge
what
questions
--
what
instructions
would
be
given.
no
mention
was
made
of
an
instruction
on
voluntariness
and
a
small
wonder
why
because
defense
counsel
deliberately
shows
not
to
emphasize
the
confessions
of
the
jury.
this
was
an
experienced
criminal
trial
error,
he
chose
rather
to
concern
himself
and
to
focus
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
one
question
and
one
question
only
and
that
was
the
question
of
clemency.
the
defense
counsel
had
a
perfect
opportunity
immediately
after
the
voir
dire
and
after
the
jury
had
been
brought
back
into
the
room
to
mention
to
the
jury
that
he
was
contesting
voluntariness.
the
trial
judge
said
to
defense
counsel,
when
defense
council
objected
the
second
time,
what
is
the
nature
of
your
objection
counsel
whereupon
trial
counsel
said
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
“your
honor,
the
nature
of
my
objection
is
the
same
i
raised
in
the
voir
dire.”
he
had
a
perfect
opportunity
to
say
at
that
time
the
nature
of
my
objection,
the
confession
was
involuntary,
he
chose
not
to
do
that.
at
the
close
of
the
testimony,
the
defense
counsel
addressed
the
jury
in
argument
and
said
to
them
i
wouldn’t
now
try
to
convince
you
to
find
the
defendant
ronald
johnson
not
guilty.
i
wouldn’t
attempt
to
insult
your
intelligence,
after
that
the
petitioner
himself
addressed
the
jury
in
an
un-sworn
statement
as
is
the
custom
and
as
is
his
right
under
massachusetts
law
and
he
said
all
the
evidence
which
the
prosecutor
presented
to
you
was
true
where
upon
he
asked
the
jury
for
clemency.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right
your
honor.
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
in
this
case
which
was
a
sufficient
reason
to
persuade
counsel
and
petitioner
to
adopt
this
strategic
waiver
of
contesting
voluntariness
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
is
it
your
question
your
honor
that
--
is
the
assumption
you
are
making
that
you
would
find
that
error
because
the
burden
of
proof
was
assigned
to
the
defendant?
mr.
brian
concannon
on
voir
dire?
mr.
brian
concannon
and
that
the
--
at
that
point
the
commonwealth
should
have
negatived
any
question
of
the
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
the
latter
that
not
only
before
the
jury
but
he
had
another
opportunity
for
motions
to
new
trial.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
--
i
would
like
to
change
my
answer
on
that.
i
think
that
if
the
trial
court
violated
the
defendant’s
constitutional
rights
by
finding
a
confession
voluntary
which
in
law
and
in
fact
was
involuntary
that
this
court
should
not
affirm
the
decision.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
say
not
reverse
your
honor,
i
would
say
remand
to
the
massachusetts
court
for
further
hearings
using
the
proper
standing.
mr.
brian
concannon
jackson
v.
denno,
sims
v.
georgia
i
think
was
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
if
there
were
a
brand
new
trial,
not
unless
he
made
the
statement
again
i
don’t
think
so.
i
would
say
that
the
statement
was
prompted
by
the
fact
that
the
--
by
the
total
context
in
which
it
was
given
including
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
found
voluntary
--
mr.
brian
concannon
in
essence
it’s
a
confession
on
open
court.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
un-sworn
statement
was
the
product
of
everything
that
had
gone
before.
and
if
this
court
finds
that
it
--
the
confession
itself
--
confession
in
the
technical
sense
was
the
product
of
coercion
and
everything
said
thereafter
is
the
product
of
coercion.
i
don’t
suppose
i
have
to
go
that
far
but
that’s
my
belief.
mr.
brian
concannon
no,
it
settled
law
of
course
that
unless
the
question
were
raised
below
or
decided
by
the
highest
court
of
massachusetts
that
it’s
not
probably
before
this
court
and
i
respectfully
submit,
the
question
is
not
before
this
court.
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
superior
court
level
nor
was
it
argued
before
the
supreme
judicial
court.
though
it’s
true
that
my
brother
did
include
in
is
brief
by
way
of
a
footnote
on
page
43
of
that
brief
before
the
sjc,
a
discussion
of
the
rule
for
the
respect
to
burden
of
proof.
this
wasn’t
an
argument
however
this
was
a
dissertation.
it
begins
by
saying
it’s
unclear
under
massachusetts
law
whether
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
or
whether
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
well.
the
footnote
goes
on
to
discuss
the
massachusetts
law
and
it
mentions
indeed
federal
law.
but
it
was
not
a
challenge,
not
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
rule
to
the
rule
assigning
burden
of
proof
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
defendant
and
we
say
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
it
would
affect
the
case
your
honor
as
i
read
the
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
it
is.
mr.
brian
concannon
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
rule
of
assigning
his
error
in
any
event
of
raising
the
question
at
the
state
level
is
to
allow
the
state
to
decide
the
question
which
involves
state
law
and
federal
law
within
the
matrix
of
the
state
law.
indeed
a
case
cited
by
my
brother,
the
case
of
musser
versus
utah
makes
that
very
clear,
that
this
is
the
reason
behind
the
rule
and
that
this
court
should
not
decide
the
question
without
giving
the
courts
of
massachusetts,
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
constitutional
challenge
to
its
laws.
i
don’t
think
that
that
--
mr.
brian
concannon
only—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
cited
henry
versus
mississippi
in
the
brief
your
honor
i
believe
to
show
that
this
court
without
passing
on
the
question
directly
indicated
at
least
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
possible
for
the
counsel
to
make
a
strategic
waiver
which
our
position
is
--
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
it
may
have
been
--
the
picture
that’s
clearest
in
my
mind
however
sims
versus
georgia.
the
petitioner
argues
that
these
--
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
whenever
used
in
weighing
the
factors
indicating
voluntariness
in
the
court
below.
but
in
the
voir
dire,
the
judge
heard
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
education,
his
occupation,
his
physical
condition
and
appearance
at
that
time,
his
apparent
intelligence
and
temperament,
the
then
apparent
total
lack
of
warnings
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
police
dominated
atmosphere.
later
on,
on
the
hearing
of
a
motion
for
new
trial,
he
heard
further
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
prior
experience
with
the
police
and
he
heard
further
evidence
that
warnings
under
the
escobedo
rule
were
totally
lacking
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
a
warning
was
attempted
to
be
given.
he
heard
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
activity
in
cross
examining,
accuses
the
fact
that
he
have
received
food
during
the
night
in
his
prior
military
service.
upon
all
this
evidence,
the
judge
said,
i
will
satisfy
by
the
fair
weight
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
gave
the
statement
voluntarily.
so
it
may
well
be
that
even
if
the
burden
of
proof
which
massachusetts
assigns
to
the
defendant
would
theoretically
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
was
harmless
here
because
it
made
no
difference.
the
judge
found
that
on
the
fair
weight
of
the
testimony
in
the
evidence
the
defendant
gave
the
statement
voluntarily.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
weight
of
the
evidence
your
honor?
mr.
brian
concannon
no
he
didn’t
your
honor
and
to
the
extent
that
he
didn’t
--
to
the
extent
that
he
didn’t
articulate
because
he
couldn’t
say
miranda
then.
he
said
that
he
did
not
articulate
the
prior
massachusetts
law
for
example
saying
that
failure
to
warn
with
significant
was
caused
by
the
purposeful
methods
of
trial
counsel.
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
trial
judge
gave
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
state
the
defendant
counsel
to
state
exactly
what
he
was
relying
on.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
regardless
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
is,
a
litigant
be
he
a
civil
or
criminal
litigant
has
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
indicate
to
the
court
at
least
in
a
semi
specific
way
of
what
he
is
relying
on.
and
in
this
case
a
load
--
although
the
defendant
was
given
full
opportunity
he
chose
voluntarily
this
was
not
mistake
on
the
part
of
trial
counsel.
he
was
represented
by
quite
competent
counsel.
the
counsel
chose
to
zero
in
first
on
physical
brutality
and
then
on
fairly
to
give
the
escobedo
warning.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
supposed
that’s
true
your
honor
but
in
this
case
the
defendant
did
do
something
and
did
point
out
to
the
trial
judge
what
he
was
relying
on.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
even
if
this
court
says
assign
the
burden
of
proof
was
error,
that
it
should
make
no
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
--
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
correct
your
honor.
assuming
that
this
court
decides
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
as
well
as
the
burden
of
persuasion
then
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
well,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
only
if
the
defendant
chooses
to
bring
it
up
before
the
jury
because
i
don’t
believe
that
the
jury
has
to
hear
the
question.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right,
this
court
decided,
said
at
least
in
the
opinion—
mr.
brian
concannon
that
was
the
holding
in
jackson
versus
denno.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
it
is
my
answer
but
i'm
going
further
than
that
your
honor.
there's
no
question
jackson
v
denno
does
not
require
that
the
case
--
the
question
of
voluntariness
go
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
i
don’t
think
it
does,
it
think
it’s
a
separate
question.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
if
this
court
decides
that
the
burden
of
proof
question
is
before
it
and
if
it
also
decides
that
the
burden
of
proof
question
was
not
implicit
in
miranda
and
it
further
decides
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
voir
dire
as
well
then
i
suppose
that’s
correct
--
that
was
constitutional--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
that’s
not
being
argued
by
my
brother.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
brian
concannon
oh
yes
the
normal
prelude
--
mr.
brian
concannon
the
normal
prelude
which
is
contained
in
the
confession
itself
i
have
it
here
at
page
191
of
the
record.
where
the
interrogator
introduces
himself
and
says
who
he
is
and
that
he’s
in
the
presence
of
another
policeman
and
that
there
is
also
a
stenographer
present
and
he
says
i'm
going
to
ask
you
certain
questions
directing
the
statement
to
the
defendant
johnson
relative
to
an
incident
that
took
place
on
boylston
street.
are
you
willing
to
answer
the
questions
regarding
this
incident?
yes
i
am.
that
goes
on
from
there
and
largely
a
question
in
answer
form
up
to
the
essential
crime
itself
which
incidentally
is
not
in
the
type
of
question
and
answer
form
that
this
court
has
found
on
in
prior
cases.
it
wasn’t
really
leading
questions
at
that
time.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
it
was
in
the
statement
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
it
is.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
it
your
honor.
that’s
the
only
statement
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes,
of
course
my
brother
argues
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
that
warnings
were
given
and
for
that
and
other
reasons,
other
testimony
before
the
jury
for
example
apparently
was
injured
he
ran
into
a
wall
and
45
motor
vehicles
before
he
cracked
into
the
bus.
that
there
was
evidence
so
my
brother
argues.
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
and
that’s
why
the
judge
should
have
made
the
instruction
anyway.
but
--
mr.
brian
concannon
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
this
opinion
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
nothing
very
direct.
i
think
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
on
an
automobile
accident
and
that
he
was
injured.
but
nothing
that
could
raise
the
question
it
seems
to
me
in
a
meaningful
context
that
it
was
an
involuntary
statement.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
say
it
was
not
before
the
jury
because
the
defendant
never
attempted
to
get
the
question
before
the
jury,
in
fact
attempted
to
do
the
reverse.
he
attempted
to
minimize
anything
except
plea
for
clemency.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
that
was
before
the
jury
but
i
would
stand
correct
that
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes,
it
was
on
his
un-sworn
statement.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
not
evidence
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
police
stenographer.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury,
only
in
the
voir
dire.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
he
did.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
believe
he
did.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
certainly
couldn’t
your
honor
it
chose
freely
not
to.
i
would
conclude—
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor
that’s
an--
mr.
brian
concannon
well
--
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
in
the
1963—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
that
in
1963
before
escobedo
and
miranda
the
police
were
just
not
as
conscious
of
this
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
and
that’s
the
only
answer
i
would
have
as
to
why
more
wasn’t
done
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so
yes.
i
should
say
i
don’t
know
that
it
was
--
i
don’t
know
how
common
it
was.
i
guess
i'm
answering
a
question
by
assuming
that
it
was
customary.
i'm
--
i
did
not
prosecute
the
case
at
the
trial
level
and
i
get
this
case
as
most
others
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
on
the
appellate
level.
so
i'm
probably
not
that
qualified
to
state
what
the
police
practice
was
at
this
time
in
the
city
of
boston.
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
the
trial
judge
had
before
him
in
evidence
all
of
the
facts
that
this
court
has
considered
relevant
to
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
certainly
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
to
articulate
all
his
findings
and
there
is
the
normal
presumption
that
a
trial
judge
does
consider
all
the
evidence
before
him.
and
to
the
extent
that
he
did
not
state
that
all
of
the
things
were
done
which
this
court
has
now
said
should
be
done
in
the
miranda
case.
this
was
prompted
only
by
the
purposeful
trial
tactics
of
the
counsel
and
this
court
should
not
upset
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
to
voluntariness
which
was
obtained
by
one
of
--
not
one
but
two
factual
hearings.
in
essence
this
is
the
third
factual
hearing
which
the
petitioner
is
now
seeking.
and
i
think
this
court
can
find
that
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
this
confession
was
voluntary.
i
don’t
propose
to
color
match
but
in
no
case
before
this
court
have
facts
of
so
little
weight
with
regard
to
involuntariness
that
prompted
the
decision
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
answer
is
no
your
honor
but
i
don’t
really
think
that
that’s
as
coercive
as
something
like
what
was
done
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
this
court
decided
was
a
case
for
voluntary
confession
where
the
defendant
had
no
sleep
for
the
first
42
hours
of
captivity.
i
don’t
think
it’s
as
coercive
as—
mr.
brian
concannon
no,
but
he
was
kept
for
a
matter
of
--
no,
no.
but
again
my
answer
is
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
the
man
did
not
sleep
for
46
hours.
he
was
kept
for
a
matter
of
weeks
by
the
police
and
his
confession
was
finally
given
after
he
said
to
the
police
if
you
take
me
out
in
--
mr.
brian
concannon
42
hours
without
sleep.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
it
was
continuous
interrogation,
no.
but
he
was
in
captivity
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
sleep.
mr.
brian
concannon
ronald
johnson
we’re
talking
about,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so
your
honor.
in
the
cases,
where
this
court
has
found
the
confession
involuntary,
it
seems
to
me
in
almost
every
case
there
is
something
shocking,
something
egregious
42
hours
without—
mr.
brian
concannon
i'm
afraid
it
doesn’t
shock
me
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
for
all
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned,
the
commonwealth
respectfully
urges
to
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
brian
concannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
confession
here
was
a
voluntary
one.
there's
no
question
before
this
court
as
to
the
physical
coercion
that
was
found
as
a
fact
not
to
be
served
by
the
trial
judge.
whether
or
not
there
was
psychological
coercion
is
to
be
determined
by
balancing
the
circumstances
of
pressure
against
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
that
pressure.
the
circumstances
of
pressure
were
delineated
by
my
brother.
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
in
this
case
is
as
follows.
this
was
a
29-year
old
man.
he
had
been
to
the
eighth
grade
or
in
any
event
had
attended
junior
high
school,
his
iq
measured
under
less
than
ideal
circumstances
was
86
in
the
dull,
normal
range.
he
had
experienced
in
the
military
service
as
a
(inaudible)
guard
and
as
defendant.
he
had
significant
experience
with
the
police
with
regard
to
arrests
and
interrogations
for
violations,
alleged
violations
of
motor
vehicle
law,
public
utility
law,
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
armed
robbery,
disorderly
conduct
and
homicide.
one
of
those
investigations
involved
a
5-hour
custodial
interrogation.
whatever
deficiency
if
indeed
there
was
a
deficiency
in
this
man’s
iq
as
theoretically
measured
should
be
more
than
out
waived
by
his
practical
intelligence
and
by
his
sophistication
in
dealing
with
the
police
as
a
result
of
his
experience.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
left
the
service
under
it
was
not
an
honorable
discharge.
i
believe
that
it
was
as
a
result
of
not
--
i
think
it
was
inefficiency.
he
was
not
able
to
perform
i
think
it
had
something
to
do
with
his
intelligence.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
on
this
occasion
in
question
and
on
every
other
occasion
which
he
had
dealings
with
the
police
this
man
was
not
done
as
to
his
rights.
his
statements
to
the
police
on
this
occasion
and
on
other
occasions
negative
it
seems
to
me
the
aspect
of
an
ignorant
individual
who
was
being
intimidated
by
the
police.
the
record
is
abundant
with
his
asseverations
to
the
police.
i
don’t
have
to
make
a
call
i
don’t
have
to
tell
you
cops
anything.
i
know
my
rights.
in
addition
to
the
spectacle
of
cross
examining
his
accuses
at
the
time
of
these
confrontations
and
lineups
are
you
sure
that
i'm
the
person,
did
you
see
me
shoot
the
cop.
if
there
were
10
called
on
the
lineup
could
you
have
picked
me
out?
mr.
brian
concannon
he
certainly
was
not
as
efficient
mr.
justice
marshall
as
a
trial
lawyer.
but
i
mentioned
his
activity
in
cross
examining
his
accusers
to
point
out
not
that
he
did
not
need
a
lawyer
but
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
individual
that
appears
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
showing
--
deciding
involuntariness.
in
no
case
this
court
has
decided
do
we
have
a
finding
on
involuntariness
in
such
circumstances
as
these.
certainly
not
--
no
case
has
gone
this
far
with
regard
to
the
coercive
pressures
and
no
case
has
gone
this
far
with
regard
to
the
power
of
the
individual
to
resist
and
it’s
for
that
purpose
only
that
i
mentioned
it.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
questioned
for
information.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
questioned
for
information.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
that
may
have
been
on
the
minds
of
the
police
your
honor
yes.
but
this
was
not
the
kind
of
case
showing
an
unyielding
contrivance
against
this
man
because
--
mr.
brian
concannon
it’s
not
the
practice
today
your
honor.
whether
it’s
normal,
according
to
the
police
procedures
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor
this
was
a
killing
of
policeman
that
occurred
in
the
early
evening.
he
was
brought
to
the
station
and
the
police
were
very
anxious
to
know
as
much
about
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
could
find
out.
there
were
witnesses,
they
were
brought
both
to
the
headquarters,
they
were
brought
to
station
10.
mr.
brian
concannon
i'm
not
sure
i
would
go
that
far
but
i
would
say
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
brian
concannon
and
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
although
i'm
speaking
off
the
record
that
the
police
were
interested
in
getting
a
statement
from
this
man.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
that’s
always
the
purpose
behind
getting
a
statement
from
quite
candidly
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
not
argue
that
your
honor.
there's
no
question—
mr.
brian
concannon
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer
and
if
the
case
were
to
take
place
today—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
a
little
bit
if
i
may.
mr.
brian
concannon
--caused
by
the
activity
of
the
petitioner
himself.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
this
was
a
finding
of
-
created
partially
yes
--
this
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
lieutenant
richardson
warned
this
man
at
the
booking
desk
pursuant
to
massachusetts
law
that
he
had
the
right
to
call
a
lawyer,
a
bail
commissioner,
a
friend
or
a
relative.
the
trial
judge
found
as
a
fact
that
this
warning
was
not
completely
communicated
to
the
petitioner,
partly
due
to
the
confusion
in
the
police
station
partly
due
to
the
obstreperous
conduct
of
the
petitioner
himself.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
this
questioning
was
not
constant
questioning,
giving
the
greatest
leeway
to
the
interpretation
of
the
record
that
we
point
out
in
footnote
10
of
our
brief.
this
man
could
not
have
been
questioned
for
more
than
two-and-a-half
hours
at
most.
but
i
agree
with
your
honor
to
this
extent
that
this
is
conduct
which
is
impermissible
by
today’s
standards
but
we’re
talking
about
pre-miranda
cases.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor,
perhaps
i
can
shortcut
it
for
you.
we
concede
that
this
was
a
police
dominated
atmosphere.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
was
brought
to
station
10.
there
were
many
policemen
around
at
the
booking
desk.
he
was
struggling
at
that
time
so
there
were
policeman
needed
to
restrain
him.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
there
was
--
at
the
booking
desk
i'm
not
sure
--
i
think
the
record
would
indicated
that
in
the
immediate
vicinity
there
was
about
a
half
dozen
policemen.
mr.
brian
concannon
then
he
was
given
medical
attention
and
put
in
a
cell
and
these
facts
were
not
fully
developed
for
the
simple
reason
that
at
trial,
he
claimed
that
he
was
being
beaten
all
the
time.
the
judge
disbelieved
this.
this
opacity
of
facts
as
to
just
how
many
policemen
were
around.
there
were
many
dozens
of
policeman
that
came
to
the
court
to
testify
so
that
at
various
times
during
the
night
he
was
in
the
presence
of
more
than
a
hundred
policemen.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
record
indicates
that
only
lieutenant
donovan
conducted
the
interrogation.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
lieutenant
richardson
warned
him—attempted
to
warn
him
of
his
rights
to
call
a
lawyer.
as
far
as
the
record
bears
out
i
believe
that
lieutenant
donovan
was
the
only
one
who
interrogated
him.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
i
don’t
believe
that’s
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
record
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
testimony
of
course
went
much
further
for
the
defendant
that
he
was
beaten
by
the
policeman
but
this
was
disapproved.
mr.
brian
concannon
at
the
time
of
the
lineups
there
were
over
a
hundred
policemen
sitting
back
watching
the
lineup
only
lieutenant
donovan
as
my
brother
pointed
out
questioned
him
at
that
time.
there
was
a
stenographer
present
who
said
nothing,
nearly
took
down
what
was
said.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
this
was
a
large
city,
the
city
of
boston
your
honor
and
there
were
many
lineups
during
the
night
--
not
only
in
connection
with
this
individual
but
many
others.
the
policeman—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
this
was
the
headquarters
not
the
police
precinct.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
they
were
doing
it
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
serious
crime
and
there
were
many
serious
crimes
committed
around
this
time.
i
don’t
know
if
there
were
many
committed
on
that
evening
but
the
record
doesn’t
indicate
and
i
don’t
know
whether
all
the
policemen
were
here
for
this
case
or
not.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor
that’s
correct.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
an
accurate
statement
and
if
i
may
elaborate
upon
i
think—
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
perfectly
accurate.
more
than
that
there
was
a
bench
conference
at
which
the
attorneys
discussed
with
the
judge
what
questions
--
what
instructions
would
be
given.
no
mention
was
made
of
an
instruction
on
voluntariness
and
a
small
wonder
why
because
defense
counsel
deliberately
shows
not
to
emphasize
the
confessions
of
the
jury.
this
was
an
experienced
criminal
trial
error,
he
chose
rather
to
concern
himself
and
to
focus
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
one
question
and
one
question
only
and
that
was
the
question
of
clemency.
the
defense
counsel
had
a
perfect
opportunity
immediately
after
the
voir
dire
and
after
the
jury
had
been
brought
back
into
the
room
to
mention
to
the
jury
that
he
was
contesting
voluntariness.
the
trial
judge
said
to
defense
counsel,
when
defense
council
objected
the
second
time,
what
is
the
nature
of
your
objection
counsel
whereupon
trial
counsel
said
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
“your
honor,
the
nature
of
my
objection
is
the
same
i
raised
in
the
voir
dire.”
he
had
a
perfect
opportunity
to
say
at
that
time
the
nature
of
my
objection,
the
confession
was
involuntary,
he
chose
not
to
do
that.
at
the
close
of
the
testimony,
the
defense
counsel
addressed
the
jury
in
argument
and
said
to
them
i
wouldn’t
now
try
to
convince
you
to
find
the
defendant
ronald
johnson
not
guilty.
i
wouldn’t
attempt
to
insult
your
intelligence,
after
that
the
petitioner
himself
addressed
the
jury
in
an
un-sworn
statement
as
is
the
custom
and
as
is
his
right
under
massachusetts
law
and
he
said
all
the
evidence
which
the
prosecutor
presented
to
you
was
true
where
upon
he
asked
the
jury
for
clemency.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right
your
honor.
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
in
this
case
which
was
a
sufficient
reason
to
persuade
counsel
and
petitioner
to
adopt
this
strategic
waiver
of
contesting
voluntariness
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
is
it
your
question
your
honor
that
--
is
the
assumption
you
are
making
that
you
would
find
that
error
because
the
burden
of
proof
was
assigned
to
the
defendant?
mr.
brian
concannon
on
voir
dire?
mr.
brian
concannon
and
that
the
--
at
that
point
the
commonwealth
should
have
negatived
any
question
of
the
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
the
latter
that
not
only
before
the
jury
but
he
had
another
opportunity
for
motions
to
new
trial.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
--
i
would
like
to
change
my
answer
on
that.
i
think
that
if
the
trial
court
violated
the
defendant’s
constitutional
rights
by
finding
a
confession
voluntary
which
in
law
and
in
fact
was
involuntary
that
this
court
should
not
affirm
the
decision.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
say
not
reverse
your
honor,
i
would
say
remand
to
the
massachusetts
court
for
further
hearings
using
the
proper
standing.
mr.
brian
concannon
jackson
v.
denno,
sims
v.
georgia
i
think
was
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
if
there
were
a
brand
new
trial,
not
unless
he
made
the
statement
again
i
don’t
think
so.
i
would
say
that
the
statement
was
prompted
by
the
fact
that
the
--
by
the
total
context
in
which
it
was
given
including
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
found
voluntary
--
mr.
brian
concannon
in
essence
it’s
a
confession
on
open
court.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
un-sworn
statement
was
the
product
of
everything
that
had
gone
before.
and
if
this
court
finds
that
it
--
the
confession
itself
--
confession
in
the
technical
sense
was
the
product
of
coercion
and
everything
said
thereafter
is
the
product
of
coercion.
i
don’t
suppose
i
have
to
go
that
far
but
that’s
my
belief.
mr.
brian
concannon
no,
it
settled
law
of
course
that
unless
the
question
were
raised
below
or
decided
by
the
highest
court
of
massachusetts
that
it’s
not
probably
before
this
court
and
i
respectfully
submit,
the
question
is
not
before
this
court.
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
superior
court
level
nor
was
it
argued
before
the
supreme
judicial
court.
though
it’s
true
that
my
brother
did
include
in
is
brief
by
way
of
a
footnote
on
page
43
of
that
brief
before
the
sjc,
a
discussion
of
the
rule
for
the
respect
to
burden
of
proof.
this
wasn’t
an
argument
however
this
was
a
dissertation.
it
begins
by
saying
it’s
unclear
under
massachusetts
law
whether
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
or
whether
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
well.
the
footnote
goes
on
to
discuss
the
massachusetts
law
and
it
mentions
indeed
federal
law.
but
it
was
not
a
challenge,
not
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
rule
to
the
rule
assigning
burden
of
proof
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
defendant
and
we
say
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
it
would
affect
the
case
your
honor
as
i
read
the
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
it
is.
mr.
brian
concannon
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
rule
of
assigning
his
error
in
any
event
of
raising
the
question
at
the
state
level
is
to
allow
the
state
to
decide
the
question
which
involves
state
law
and
federal
law
within
the
matrix
of
the
state
law.
indeed
a
case
cited
by
my
brother,
the
case
of
musser
versus
utah
makes
that
very
clear,
that
this
is
the
reason
behind
the
rule
and
that
this
court
should
not
decide
the
question
without
giving
the
courts
of
massachusetts,
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
constitutional
challenge
to
its
laws.
i
don’t
think
that
that
--
mr.
brian
concannon
only—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
cited
henry
versus
mississippi
in
the
brief
your
honor
i
believe
to
show
that
this
court
without
passing
on
the
question
directly
indicated
at
least
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
possible
for
the
counsel
to
make
a
strategic
waiver
which
our
position
is
--
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
it
may
have
been
--
the
picture
that’s
clearest
in
my
mind
however
sims
versus
georgia.
the
petitioner
argues
that
these
--
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
whenever
used
in
weighing
the
factors
indicating
voluntariness
in
the
court
below.
but
in
the
voir
dire,
the
judge
heard
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
education,
his
occupation,
his
physical
condition
and
appearance
at
that
time,
his
apparent
intelligence
and
temperament,
the
then
apparent
total
lack
of
warnings
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
police
dominated
atmosphere.
later
on,
on
the
hearing
of
a
motion
for
new
trial,
he
heard
further
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
prior
experience
with
the
police
and
he
heard
further
evidence
that
warnings
under
the
escobedo
rule
were
totally
lacking
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
a
warning
was
attempted
to
be
given.
he
heard
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
activity
in
cross
examining,
accuses
the
fact
that
he
have
received
food
during
the
night
in
his
prior
military
service.
upon
all
this
evidence,
the
judge
said,
i
will
satisfy
by
the
fair
weight
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
gave
the
statement
voluntarily.
so
it
may
well
be
that
even
if
the
burden
of
proof
which
massachusetts
assigns
to
the
defendant
would
theoretically
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
was
harmless
here
because
it
made
no
difference.
the
judge
found
that
on
the
fair
weight
of
the
testimony
in
the
evidence
the
defendant
gave
the
statement
voluntarily.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
weight
of
the
evidence
your
honor?
mr.
brian
concannon
no
he
didn’t
your
honor
and
to
the
extent
that
he
didn’t
--
to
the
extent
that
he
didn’t
articulate
because
he
couldn’t
say
miranda
then.
he
said
that
he
did
not
articulate
the
prior
massachusetts
law
for
example
saying
that
failure
to
warn
with
significant
was
caused
by
the
purposeful
methods
of
trial
counsel.
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
trial
judge
gave
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
state
the
defendant
counsel
to
state
exactly
what
he
was
relying
on.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
regardless
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
is,
a
litigant
be
he
a
civil
or
criminal
litigant
has
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
indicate
to
the
court
at
least
in
a
semi
specific
way
of
what
he
is
relying
on.
and
in
this
case
a
load
--
although
the
defendant
was
given
full
opportunity
he
chose
voluntarily
this
was
not
mistake
on
the
part
of
trial
counsel.
he
was
represented
by
quite
competent
counsel.
the
counsel
chose
to
zero
in
first
on
physical
brutality
and
then
on
fairly
to
give
the
escobedo
warning.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
supposed
that’s
true
your
honor
but
in
this
case
the
defendant
did
do
something
and
did
point
out
to
the
trial
judge
what
he
was
relying
on.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
even
if
this
court
says
assign
the
burden
of
proof
was
error,
that
it
should
make
no
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
--
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
correct
your
honor.
assuming
that
this
court
decides
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
as
well
as
the
burden
of
persuasion
then
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
think
well,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
only
if
the
defendant
chooses
to
bring
it
up
before
the
jury
because
i
don’t
believe
that
the
jury
has
to
hear
the
question.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right,
this
court
decided,
said
at
least
in
the
opinion—
mr.
brian
concannon
that
was
the
holding
in
jackson
versus
denno.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
it
is
my
answer
but
i'm
going
further
than
that
your
honor.
there's
no
question
jackson
v
denno
does
not
require
that
the
case
--
the
question
of
voluntariness
go
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
i
don’t
think
it
does,
it
think
it’s
a
separate
question.
mr.
brian
concannon
well
if
this
court
decides
that
the
burden
of
proof
question
is
before
it
and
if
it
also
decides
that
the
burden
of
proof
question
was
not
implicit
in
miranda
and
it
further
decides
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
voir
dire
as
well
then
i
suppose
that’s
correct
--
that
was
constitutional--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor.
that’s
not
being
argued
by
my
brother.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
brian
concannon
oh
yes
the
normal
prelude
--
mr.
brian
concannon
the
normal
prelude
which
is
contained
in
the
confession
itself
i
have
it
here
at
page
191
of
the
record.
where
the
interrogator
introduces
himself
and
says
who
he
is
and
that
he’s
in
the
presence
of
another
policeman
and
that
there
is
also
a
stenographer
present
and
he
says
i'm
going
to
ask
you
certain
questions
directing
the
statement
to
the
defendant
johnson
relative
to
an
incident
that
took
place
on
boylston
street.
are
you
willing
to
answer
the
questions
regarding
this
incident?
yes
i
am.
that
goes
on
from
there
and
largely
a
question
in
answer
form
up
to
the
essential
crime
itself
which
incidentally
is
not
in
the
type
of
question
and
answer
form
that
this
court
has
found
on
in
prior
cases.
it
wasn’t
really
leading
questions
at
that
time.
mr.
brian
concannon
no
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
it
was
in
the
statement
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
it
is.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
it
your
honor.
that’s
the
only
statement
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes,
of
course
my
brother
argues
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
that
warnings
were
given
and
for
that
and
other
reasons,
other
testimony
before
the
jury
for
example
apparently
was
injured
he
ran
into
a
wall
and
45
motor
vehicles
before
he
cracked
into
the
bus.
that
there
was
evidence
so
my
brother
argues.
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
and
that’s
why
the
judge
should
have
made
the
instruction
anyway.
but
--
mr.
brian
concannon
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
this
opinion
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
nothing
very
direct.
i
think
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
on
an
automobile
accident
and
that
he
was
injured.
but
nothing
that
could
raise
the
question
it
seems
to
me
in
a
meaningful
context
that
it
was
an
involuntary
statement.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
would
say
it
was
not
before
the
jury
because
the
defendant
never
attempted
to
get
the
question
before
the
jury,
in
fact
attempted
to
do
the
reverse.
he
attempted
to
minimize
anything
except
plea
for
clemency.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
that
was
before
the
jury
but
i
would
stand
correct
that
--
mr.
brian
concannon
yes,
it
was
on
his
un-sworn
statement.
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
not
evidence
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
police
stenographer.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury.
mr.
brian
concannon
not
before
the
jury,
only
in
the
voir
dire.
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
he
did.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
believe
he
did.
mr.
brian
concannon
he
certainly
couldn’t
your
honor
it
chose
freely
not
to.
i
would
conclude—
mr.
brian
concannon
yes
your
honor
that’s
an--
mr.
brian
concannon
well
--
mr.
brian
concannon
that’s
right.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
in
the
1963—
mr.
brian
concannon
i
suppose
that
in
1963
before
escobedo
and
miranda
the
police
were
just
not
as
conscious
of
this
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
and
that’s
the
only
answer
i
would
have
as
to
why
more
wasn’t
done
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so
yes.
i
should
say
i
don’t
know
that
it
was
--
i
don’t
know
how
common
it
was.
i
guess
i'm
answering
a
question
by
assuming
that
it
was
customary.
i'm
--
i
did
not
prosecute
the
case
at
the
trial
level
and
i
get
this
case
as
most
others
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
on
the
appellate
level.
so
i'm
probably
not
that
qualified
to
state
what
the
police
practice
was
at
this
time
in
the
city
of
boston.
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
the
trial
judge
had
before
him
in
evidence
all
of
the
facts
that
this
court
has
considered
relevant
to
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
certainly
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
to
articulate
all
his
findings
and
there
is
the
normal
presumption
that
a
trial
judge
does
consider
all
the
evidence
before
him.
and
to
the
extent
that
he
did
not
state
that
all
of
the
things
were
done
which
this
court
has
now
said
should
be
done
in
the
miranda
case.
this
was
prompted
only
by
the
purposeful
trial
tactics
of
the
counsel
and
this
court
should
not
upset
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
to
voluntariness
which
was
obtained
by
one
of
--
not
one
but
two
factual
hearings.
in
essence
this
is
the
third
factual
hearing
which
the
petitioner
is
now
seeking.
and
i
think
this
court
can
find
that
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
this
confession
was
voluntary.
i
don’t
propose
to
color
match
but
in
no
case
before
this
court
have
facts
of
so
little
weight
with
regard
to
involuntariness
that
prompted
the
decision
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
brian
concannon
the
answer
is
no
your
honor
but
i
don’t
really
think
that
that’s
as
coercive
as
something
like
what
was
done
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
this
court
decided
was
a
case
for
voluntary
confession
where
the
defendant
had
no
sleep
for
the
first
42
hours
of
captivity.
i
don’t
think
it’s
as
coercive
as—
mr.
brian
concannon
no,
but
he
was
kept
for
a
matter
of
--
no,
no.
but
again
my
answer
is
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
the
man
did
not
sleep
for
46
hours.
he
was
kept
for
a
matter
of
weeks
by
the
police
and
his
confession
was
finally
given
after
he
said
to
the
police
if
you
take
me
out
in
--
mr.
brian
concannon
42
hours
without
sleep.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
don’t
think
it
was
continuous
interrogation,
no.
but
he
was
in
captivity
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
sleep.
mr.
brian
concannon
ronald
johnson
we’re
talking
about,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
mr.
brian
concannon
i
believe
so
your
honor.
in
the
cases,
where
this
court
has
found
the
confession
involuntary,
it
seems
to
me
in
almost
every
case
there
is
something
shocking,
something
egregious
42
hours
without—
mr.
brian
concannon
i'm
afraid
it
doesn’t
shock
me
your
honor.
mr.
brian
concannon
for
all
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned,
the
commonwealth
respectfully
urges
to
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
