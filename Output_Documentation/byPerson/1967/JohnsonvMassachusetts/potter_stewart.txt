justice
potter
stewart
supposed
--
is
there
any
question
but
that
the
--
his
condition
at
that
time
was
a
result
of
the
collision
with
the
bus?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
august
1st,
1963?
justice
potter
stewart
will
you
make
a
two
step
deal
mr.
harrington.
number
one,
i
gather
your
proposition
is
there
must
a
voir
dire
determination
of
voluntariness
at
which
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
voluntariness.
in
other
words,
over
the
objection
to
the
admission
of
the
confession
as
i
understand
it,
this
creates
the
requirement
of
a
voir
dire.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
proceeding,
the
state
must
bare
the
burden
of
proving
voluntariness.
and
if
the
court
determines
that
yes,
the
confession
was
voluntarily
given
then
you
go
a
second
step
and
say
nevertheless
the
issue
of
voluntariness
must
begin
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
for
ultimate
determination,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
jackson
v.
denno—
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
type
of
procedure
whether
it
would
a
redetermination
on
voir
dire
under
a
correct
standard
of
burden
and
then
if
it
was
determined
it
was
voluntary
or
reinstatement
of
the
conviction
if
not
then
that
to
your
correct
order
a
new
trial
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally
i
suppose,
what
about
that
statement,
that
un-sworn
statement
at
206
if
there
were
a
new
trial
here,
did
the
state
use
that
statement
as
part
of
its
case?
justice
potter
stewart
very
damaging
admissions
--
justice
potter
stewart
yet
you
don’t
think
it
would
be
admissible
on
a
new
trial,
as
part
of
the
state’s
case
--
or
do
you
surround
the
un-sworn
statement
with
certain
safeguards
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
rely
on
henry
and
mississippi
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case
didn’t
we
send
something
back
for
a
determination
in
the
voir
dire
kind
of
proceeding
didn’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
was
thinking
of
the
procedure
you
suggest.
as
i
understand,
your
suggestion
was
that
we
find
there
was
error
in
the
allocation
of
burden
of
proof
and
we
ought
to
send
back
only
for
a
redetermination
of
voluntariness.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
something
like
what
we
did
in
henry?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
your
brother
is
correct
as
to
the
law,
it
wouldn’t
be
the
duty
of
the
defendant
to
do
anything
except
for
the
duty
of
the
prosecution.
whenever
there
is
a
confession,
whenever
there
is
a
confession,
it’s
the
duty
of
the
prosecution,
according
to
him,
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
that
the
confession
is
voluntary.
that’s
correct,
if
it
doesn’t
behold
the
defendant
to
do
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
jury
never
heard
anything
about
this.
if
he
is
correct
in
his
view
of
the
law
then
what
happened
in
the
voir
dire
doesn’t
have
very
much
to
do
with
it
because
the
prosecution
didn’t
take
the
first
step
in
proving
that
this
confession
was
voluntary
before
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
jury
as
my
brother
however
said
upon
the
premise
that
it
was
voluntary.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could
say
that
the
state
has
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
voluntariness
issue
without
concluding
that
it
must
order
the
jury
to
do
it.
i'm
assuming
to
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
was
on
the
state.
it
must
sustain
the
burden
without
saying
that
it
also
has
to
sustain
at
the
board
of
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
mean
to
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
issue
is
5316
rounded
up
with
the
argument
that
the
whole
voluntariness
issue
must
go
before
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
well
didn’t
in
jackson
and
denno,
am
i
wrong
didn’t
we
indicate
that
there
was
no
constitutional
requirement
as
long
as
there
was
a
voir
dire
in
the
determination
of
voluntariness
by
the
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
didn’t
we
--
that
there
was
no
constitutional
requirement,
did
then
the
issue
of
voluntariness
go
to
the
jury,
didn’t
we
decide
that
in
jackson
and
denno?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
isn't
that
your
answer
to
your
adversary,
that
we’ve
already
decided
that
question.
i'm
sure
massachusetts’
completely
free
of
it
once,
as
i
gather
some
states
do,
they
have
an
initial
determination
of
voluntariness
by
the
judge
and
then
they
resubmit
the
issue
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury.
but
i
thought
we
said
in
jackson
v.
denno,
so
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned.
the
only
constitutional
requirement
is
that
if
the
determination
of
voluntariness
by
the
judge
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
and
after
that
except
to
the
state
but
the
constitution
doesn’t
compel
it
to
submit
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
isn't
that
your
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
means
that
that
also
solves
your
burden
of
proof
question?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statement
was
made
or
rather
the
interrogation
and
the
answers
took
placed
were
not
brought
to
the—before
the
jury.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
reading
here
at
the
record
on
page
190
up
through
192
as
far
as
i
see
it
was
simply
the
man
got
on
the
stand
as
you
have
indicated.
lieutenant
detective
donovan
and
simply
read
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
page
191
to
the
jury.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
how
about
beginning
at
page
201?
now
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
and
that’s
it
so
far
as
the
jury
abides
in
the
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
that
puzzled
me
because
surely
on
you
don’t
disagree
as
to
what
was
before
the
jury
and
you
just
told
me
there
wasn’t
anything
except
what
appears
here
on
page
191.
what
was
the—
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
before
the
jury
bearing
on
this
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
before
the
jury
that
he
had
not
been
warned
of
his
so
called
rights?
in
those
days
those
were
not
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
did
know
that
he
had
been
in
this
automobile
collision.
justice
potter
stewart
shortly
before
he
was
taken
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
knew
that
they're
subsequently
been
on
surgery
for
a
brain
injury
or
brain
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
wasn’t
of
course
but
the
state
--
he
said
that
in
that
statement
at
the
end
of
the
trial
whether
he
had
this
brain
operation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
don’t
know
if
it
was
in
the
evidence
at
all.
