may
i
ask
you
of
your
argument
as
reference
to
burden
of
proof
is
confined
entirely
to
the
burden
of
proof
that
you
are
now
mentioning.

it
does
go
further
than
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
--
i
have
read
my
dissent
recently
in
the
deno
case,
one
of
my
arguments
was
that
this
was
a
burden
that
rested
on
the
state
to
show
that
the
jury
had
to
preside
but
the
court
projected
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
right
on
your
burden
of
this
argument
why
does
there
have
to
be
an
evidence
at
all
as
the
defendants
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
right
on
the
burden
of
proof,
why
does
the
state
fail
to
prove
indication.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
if
you're
arguing
the
defendant.
the
evidence
of
a
confession
--
in
evidence
of
a
confession,
the
jury
has
a
right
to
pass
all
the
truthfulness
of
that
submission,
decide
it
and
that
the
fact
and
that
it
be
fact
then
there
was
some
lack
of
freedom
of
choice,
is
a
question
that
the
jury
has
to
determine
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
he
is
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.

suppose
it
were
not
in
this
occasion,
what
do
you
think
they
--

justice
hugo

this
is
direct
review,

what
effect
did
fay

have
on
being
allowed
to
raise
it
as
a
separate
proceedings
by
habeas
corpus
and
if
it

way,
why
should
we
