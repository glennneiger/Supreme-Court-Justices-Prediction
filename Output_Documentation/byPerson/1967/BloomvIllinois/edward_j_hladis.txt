mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
course
yesterday
afternoon's
argument
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
he
made
two
observations
with
which
we
must
take
issue.
one
relates
to
the
factual
aspect
of
this
case
and
the
second
relates
to
the
law
on
the
issue
as
it
has
been
announced
by
this
court.
we
address
ourselves
first
to
the
factual
aspect.
the
key
or
the
simple
facts
in
this
case
are
not
many.
the
decedent
died
on
the
6th
of
july
1964.
on
the
14th
of
july
1964,
this
petitioner
drafted
and
caused
the
execution
of
a
will
of
this
dead
person
dated
june
21,
1964
and
on
the
11th
of
august
1964,
he
presented
his
will
for
admission
to
probate
in
a
probate
division
in
cook
county
and
in
this
petition
stated
that
the
decedent
had
died
on
the
6th
of
july.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
sir,
he
was
not.
the
record
will
show
and
our
statement
of
facts
indicates
that
it
had
actually
began
with
a
practical
nurse
by
the
name
of
pauline
owens
would
increase
her
legacy
in
this
fraudulent
will
from
$20,000
and
a
valid
will
to
$40,000
in
this
will.
now
the
important
consideration
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
is
this,
yesterday
the
counsel
referred
to
the
alleged
filing
of
a
spurious
will
and
two
other
alleged
contemptuous
acts.
we
submit
gentlemen
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
at
this
time
and
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
was
made
in
the
courts
of
review
in
the
state
of
illinois
it
is
improper
for
a
counsel
to
refer
to
alleged
contemptuous
conduct
because
this
petitioner
has
not
only
failed
to
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
finding
of
guilt
but
he
affirmatively
conceded
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
findings
of
guilt
were
amply
supported
by
the
evidence.
now
we
understand
that
the
briefs
filed
by
all
parties
are
a
part
of
the
certiorari
filed
in
this
court.
that
concession
is
found
at
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
concession
is
also
noted
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
now
what
we
are
getting
at
is
this,
the
case
is
here
before
this
court
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
but
the
very
issue,
the
very
point
which
a
jury
could
give
him
to
wit
the
finding
of
guilt
or
non-guilt,
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
challenged
and
has
never
been
challenged.
the
second
observation
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
beg
pardon
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
in
the
sense
that
he
cross-examined
the
prosecution
witnesses.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
a
challenge,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
did
it
at
the
trial
but
the
point
is
that
after
the
finding
of
guilty
was
in,
he
did
not
challenge,
not
only
did
not
challenge
but
he
did
concede
that
the
findings
were
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
makes
no
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
you're
talking
about
the
amicus
curiae
report.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
then
the
third
observation
he
makes
as
the
remark
of
the
assistant
state's
attorney
who
have
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand.
now
as
to
the
first,
the
amicus
curiae
report
that
is
a
practice
that
has
been
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
we're
not
quarrelling
the
fact
that
there
was
a
contest
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
point
is
this
that
once
the
finding
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
point
is
that
what
he
wants
today,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
i
were
in
the
petitioner's
position
and
i
were
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
constitutional
doctrine
whereby
i'd
be
guaranteed
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
pursuant
to
the
sixth
amendment
as
it
would
be
imposed
upon
our
course
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
i
would
at
least
come
up
here
where
the
bona
fide
contest
on
the
findings
of
guilt.
but
he
didn't
even
do
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
in
the
courts
of
review
in
the
state
of
illinois
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
what
i
am
saying
is
that
after
the
finding
was
made,
he
not
only
did
not
challenge
the
sufficiency
but
he
actually
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
findings.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
that
was
advanced
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
think
so.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
i
think
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
gentlemen,
i
think
he'd
--
if
he
has
a
case,
i
don't
think
it's
a
sixth
amendment
case.
i
think
what
he's
actually
complaining
about
is
the
extent
of
the
punishment
and
that
would
be
our
solution
to
the
problem,
it's
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem.
the
issue
on
the
case
as
we
have
it
here
is
not
whether
he
should
have
been
given
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
would
not
mr.
justice
white
for
a
different
reason
though,
because
it's
clearly
established
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
under
article
iii
that
any
criminal
case,
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
well,
what
he's
doing
here
is
asking
this
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
formulate
a
new
doctrine
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
one
which
has
never
been
formulated
before
which
even
in
cheff
has
contrary
to
his
representation
has
no
constitutional
basis
at
all
and
is
asking
this
court
to
say
now
under
the
sixth
amendment
criminal
contempt
cases
shall
have
jury
trials
and
will
impose
it
on
the
state
by
virtue
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
that
is
not
the
only
reason
that
we
would
say
it
your
honor
because
we
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
it
is.
i
don't
see
any
inconsistency
between
the
two
at
all.
we
have
here
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
two
proceedings.
and
the
one
you
have
contempt
which
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
is
possible,
but
i
say
that
as
far
as
cook
county
is
concerned
that
will
not
happen
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
has
run
in
this
particular
case.
but
we
have
had
rare
instances
where
contempts
have
been
committed
usually
in
a
probate
level
which
are
also
felonies.
and
in
all
cases
where
the
probate
judge
has
gone
to
the
way
of
contempt,
the
state
has
not
prosecuted
criminally
and
we
did
not
do
it
here
and
we
don't
--
certainly
don't
intend
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
in
this
case
the
errors
themselves
made
the
choice.
they
are
the
ones
that
began.
they
asked
for
the
appointment
of
the
amicus
curiae
and
they
filed
a
first
petition
or
rule
to
show
a
cause
and
then
the
judge
determined
that
there
was
probable
cause
after
he
had
received
the
amicus
curiae
report
and
the
contempt
proceeding
began.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
think
it's
easier
and
i
would
think
it
is
much
more
effective
and
that
is
undoubtedly
what
the
probate
judge
wanted
to
achieve
in
this
particular
case.
because
you're
talking
about
a
court
in
a
large
metropolitan
area
and
as
we
all
know
much
of
the
practice
in
a
probate
division
is
done
what
i
might
call
on
an
ex
parte
basis
because
many
times
the
interested
party
do
not
have
counsel,
they
rely
upon
counsel
for
the
personal
representative.
and
the
court
must
rely
upon
the
integrity,
upon
the
honesty
of
the
attorneys
presenting
matters
to
them.
and
whereas
in
this
case,
you
have
a
situation
where
a
fraudulent
will
was
presented
for
admission
and
sought
to
be
processed
while
the
court
has
a
real
problem
as
far
as
discipline
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
we
do
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
think
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
strictly
speaking,
the
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
doesn't
apply.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
they're
strictly
speaking
the
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
would
not
apply
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
a
criminal
contempt.
i
just
don't
think
it
would
apply,
its
not
a
crime.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
imagine
possibly
he
might
--
well,
that's
not
a
probability
actually
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
of
the
gravity
between
the
two.
i
mean
one
is
--
that
the
forgery
in
this
particular
instance
have
to
do
with
the
very
operation
of
the
court
whereas
certainly
the
murder
would
cause
a
disturbance
in
the
court
but
i
just
cannot
visualize
that
the
--
a
probate
judge
would
move
by
way
of
contempt
rather
than
have
it
in
turn,
the
matter
over
the
state
for
prosecution
under
the
murder
statute.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
gave
what
we
submit
as
a
good
practical
sound
reason
in
this
particular
context
and
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
understand
but
by
the
same
token,
that
probate
judge
down
there
has
to
serve
a
notice
upon
the
bar
that
he
cannot
tolerate
practices
such
as
we
had
here.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
think
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
would
be
as
effective.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
mean,
if
we
--
would
probably
feel
that
he
would
deliver
a
better
message
to
the
bar
then
refer
it
all
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
whether
we
want
to
call
it
feelings
or
what
or
convictions
but
those
are
his
views.
and
of
course,
here,
as
i
pointed
out
before
is
the
fact
that
the
proceedings
were
actually
initiated
by
the
error,
the
lawful
errors
themselves.
this
is
not
something
that
was
done
completely
on
his
own
volition.
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
which
would
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
fine?
which
would
be
worse?
disbarment.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
disbarment.
well,
i
think
all
of
us
as
lawyers
are
pretty
proud
of
our
license
and
we
do
not
want
to
be
placed
in
a
position
of
ever
losing
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
elements,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well
i
don't,
i
don't
know
whether
this
contempt
would
conform
the
fair
basis
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
against
civil?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
the
reason
that
it's
called
criminal
contempt
is
the
fact
that
the
court
as
an
agency
of
the
public
is
actually
in
the
--
is
the
agent
of
the
public
and
that
the
public's
dignity
is
offended
by
specific
conduct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
of
course
mr.
justice
black
we
are
assuming
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
--
personally
i'm
concerned,
it
would
be,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
are
you
speaking
of
disbarment
now
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
disbarment.
i
can't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it's
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
is
not,
no.
the
disbarment
proceedings
are
conducted
through
grievance
committees
of
the
bar
association
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
the
commissioners
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
it's
not
automatic
disbarment.
he
has
his
hearing
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
it's
not
even
that
sir.
and
he
asks
this
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
and
as
against
disbarment,
there
may
be
censure,
there
may
be
suspension
and
there
of
course
may
be
dismissal
of
charges.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
there
are
no
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
excuse
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
understand
he
is
actively
practicing
at
the
present
time.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
and
he's
practicing.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
proceedings
in
this
case
are
--
there's
nothing
extraordinary
about
it.
the
committee
is
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
a
call
from
the
secretary
about
10
days
ago
on
the
matter
and
that
is
usual
in
all
cases.
they
will
wait
until
the
case
is
finally
disposed
before
it
is
taken
up
by
the
committee
acting
on
behalf
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
the
reason
that
they
didn't
wait
there
for
this
case
to
be
decided
is
the
fact
that
they
are
moving
against
that
union
and
particularly
the
group
that
was
servicing
them
with
professional
legal
services
is
the
very
fact
which
gave
rise
of
the
case
as
i
recall
it.
you're
talking
about
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
say
the
--
i
mean
you
want
to
call
that
illegal
practice,
i
would
say
the
presentation
of
a
fraudulent
will
and
imposing
up
on
the
court
is
the
thing
which
brought
about
his
contempt
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
know
what
you're
getting
at
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
i
think
that
we
have
two
different
situations
in
the
steel
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
steel
workers
situation
gave
rise
to
the
lawsuit
which
eventually
wound
up
in
this
court.
whereas
this
case,
what
the
bar
association
is
doing
and
the
grievance
committee
specifically
is
waiting
for
the
final
determination.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yesterday
afternoon
when
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
analyzing
the
fast
law
of
the
question
specifically
the
green
and
the
barnett
cases
and
cheff,
he
made
a
statement
regarding
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
this
court
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg
with
which
we
do
not
agree.
this
court
will
recall
that
the
majority
in
both
green
and
the
barnett
is
held
at
criminal
contempts
are
not
crimes,
and
as
such,
they
do
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
--
either
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
third
article
of
the
federal
constitution.
then
counsel
moves
on
to
the
cheff
decision
and
suggest
to
this
court
that
an
important
modification
was
made
therein
by
the
majority
and
that
the
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
in
federal
cases
wherein
sentences
exceed
six
months
has
been
raised
to
a
constitutional
level.
we
have
read
that
that
is
an
argument
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
and
was
repeated
yesterday.
we
have
disagreed
with
that
argument
and
we
still
adhere
to
our
position
that
at
no
time
as
the
majority
of
this
court
ever
said
either
that
criminal
contempt
was
a
crime
and
that
as
such
it
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
third
article
of
the
federal
constitution.
cheff
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
contempts
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
criminal
code.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
there
is
not
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
i
don't,
i
don't.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
would
depend
upon
the
case.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
but
on
our
theory,
i
would
have
much
less
trouble
than
on
theirs.
i
like
to
take
your
example
one
step
further.
let
us
take
20
years
and
let
us
assume
that
the
man
was
given
a
jury
trial.
could
i
in
all
sincerity
and
honesty
stand
here
and
defend
that
sentence
of
20
years?
i
think
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
one
to
14.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
where
a
no
--
no
jury
trial?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
have
trouble
with
the
case
but
not
on
his
theory
but
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
approach
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
defend
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
then
under
the
doctrine
of
basic
fair
play
which
after
all
is
the
core
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
could
as
we
suggested
in
green.
examine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
here
had
abused
his
discretion.
it
is
our
view
that
after
this
court
examines
the
evidence
in
the
context
it
will
find
that
the
discretion
was
not
abused
in
sentencing
the
gentleman
with
two
years.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
we
have
a
--
we
do
not
have
a
petty
offense.
we
have
a
misdemeanor
which
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
punishment
that
is
anything
a
year
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
but
they
are
--
accord
a
jury
trials,
when
they
request
them,
they
accord
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
jury
courts
in
the
police
level.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
on
request.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
he
can
either
request
it
or
waive
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
it
is
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
i
understand
it
sir,
he
has
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
he
receives
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
i
said
the
same
thing
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
when
i
said
he
may,
what
i
meant
was
that
he
can
request
it
and
then
receive
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes
but
of
course
the
waiver
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
none.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
didn't
intend
to
setup
any
distinction.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
observation.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
he's
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
could
be,
yes.
that
would
be
dependent
upon
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
their
disciplinary
proceedings.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
if
he
requested
it,
he
would
get
it.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
whether
we
call
it
anachronism
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
contempt
has
always
been
regarded.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there
--
i
will
concede
that
there
is
difficulty
on
the
part
of
someone
to
accept
the
prevailing
view
that
it
is
sui
generis
and
does
enjoy
this
unique
position.
there
are
as
you
well
know
mr.
justice
black,
those
who
feel
that
it
should
be
equated
to
the
status
of
a
crime
and
that
all
the
privileges
should
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
substantially,
what
the
federal
constitution
says
that
the
--
in
crimes
that
the
people
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
recall,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
gentlemen.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
course
yesterday
afternoon's
argument
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
he
made
two
observations
with
which
we
must
take
issue.
one
relates
to
the
factual
aspect
of
this
case
and
the
second
relates
to
the
law
on
the
issue
as
it
has
been
announced
by
this
court.
we
address
ourselves
first
to
the
factual
aspect.
the
key
or
the
simple
facts
in
this
case
are
not
many.
the
decedent
died
on
the
6th
of
july
1964.
on
the
14th
of
july
1964,
this
petitioner
drafted
and
caused
the
execution
of
a
will
of
this
dead
person
dated
june
21,
1964
and
on
the
11th
of
august
1964,
he
presented
his
will
for
admission
to
probate
in
a
probate
division
in
cook
county
and
in
this
petition
stated
that
the
decedent
had
died
on
the
6th
of
july.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
sir,
he
was
not.
the
record
will
show
and
our
statement
of
facts
indicates
that
it
had
actually
began
with
a
practical
nurse
by
the
name
of
pauline
owens
would
increase
her
legacy
in
this
fraudulent
will
from
$20,000
and
a
valid
will
to
$40,000
in
this
will.
now
the
important
consideration
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
is
this,
yesterday
the
counsel
referred
to
the
alleged
filing
of
a
spurious
will
and
two
other
alleged
contemptuous
acts.
we
submit
gentlemen
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
at
this
time
and
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
was
made
in
the
courts
of
review
in
the
state
of
illinois
it
is
improper
for
a
counsel
to
refer
to
alleged
contemptuous
conduct
because
this
petitioner
has
not
only
failed
to
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
finding
of
guilt
but
he
affirmatively
conceded
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
findings
of
guilt
were
amply
supported
by
the
evidence.
now
we
understand
that
the
briefs
filed
by
all
parties
are
a
part
of
the
certiorari
filed
in
this
court.
that
concession
is
found
at
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
concession
is
also
noted
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
now
what
we
are
getting
at
is
this,
the
case
is
here
before
this
court
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
but
the
very
issue,
the
very
point
which
a
jury
could
give
him
to
wit
the
finding
of
guilt
or
non-guilt,
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
challenged
and
has
never
been
challenged.
the
second
observation
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
beg
pardon
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
in
the
sense
that
he
cross-examined
the
prosecution
witnesses.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
a
challenge,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
did
it
at
the
trial
but
the
point
is
that
after
the
finding
of
guilty
was
in,
he
did
not
challenge,
not
only
did
not
challenge
but
he
did
concede
that
the
findings
were
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
makes
no
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
you're
talking
about
the
amicus
curiae
report.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
then
the
third
observation
he
makes
as
the
remark
of
the
assistant
state's
attorney
who
have
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand.
now
as
to
the
first,
the
amicus
curiae
report
that
is
a
practice
that
has
been
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
we're
not
quarrelling
the
fact
that
there
was
a
contest
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
point
is
this
that
once
the
finding
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
point
is
that
what
he
wants
today,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
i
were
in
the
petitioner's
position
and
i
were
asking
this
court
to
formulate
a
constitutional
doctrine
whereby
i'd
be
guaranteed
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
pursuant
to
the
sixth
amendment
as
it
would
be
imposed
upon
our
course
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
i
would
at
least
come
up
here
where
the
bona
fide
contest
on
the
findings
of
guilt.
but
he
didn't
even
do
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
in
the
courts
of
review
in
the
state
of
illinois
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
what
i
am
saying
is
that
after
the
finding
was
made,
he
not
only
did
not
challenge
the
sufficiency
but
he
actually
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
findings.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
that
was
advanced
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
think
so.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
i
think
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
gentlemen,
i
think
he'd
--
if
he
has
a
case,
i
don't
think
it's
a
sixth
amendment
case.
i
think
what
he's
actually
complaining
about
is
the
extent
of
the
punishment
and
that
would
be
our
solution
to
the
problem,
it's
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem.
the
issue
on
the
case
as
we
have
it
here
is
not
whether
he
should
have
been
given
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
would
not
mr.
justice
white
for
a
different
reason
though,
because
it's
clearly
established
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
under
article
iii
that
any
criminal
case,
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
well,
what
he's
doing
here
is
asking
this
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
formulate
a
new
doctrine
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
one
which
has
never
been
formulated
before
which
even
in
cheff
has
contrary
to
his
representation
has
no
constitutional
basis
at
all
and
is
asking
this
court
to
say
now
under
the
sixth
amendment
criminal
contempt
cases
shall
have
jury
trials
and
will
impose
it
on
the
state
by
virtue
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
that
is
not
the
only
reason
that
we
would
say
it
your
honor
because
we
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
it
is.
i
don't
see
any
inconsistency
between
the
two
at
all.
we
have
here
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
two
proceedings.
and
the
one
you
have
contempt
which
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
is
possible,
but
i
say
that
as
far
as
cook
county
is
concerned
that
will
not
happen
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
has
run
in
this
particular
case.
but
we
have
had
rare
instances
where
contempts
have
been
committed
usually
in
a
probate
level
which
are
also
felonies.
and
in
all
cases
where
the
probate
judge
has
gone
to
the
way
of
contempt,
the
state
has
not
prosecuted
criminally
and
we
did
not
do
it
here
and
we
don't
--
certainly
don't
intend
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
in
this
case
the
errors
themselves
made
the
choice.
they
are
the
ones
that
began.
they
asked
for
the
appointment
of
the
amicus
curiae
and
they
filed
a
first
petition
or
rule
to
show
a
cause
and
then
the
judge
determined
that
there
was
probable
cause
after
he
had
received
the
amicus
curiae
report
and
the
contempt
proceeding
began.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
think
it's
easier
and
i
would
think
it
is
much
more
effective
and
that
is
undoubtedly
what
the
probate
judge
wanted
to
achieve
in
this
particular
case.
because
you're
talking
about
a
court
in
a
large
metropolitan
area
and
as
we
all
know
much
of
the
practice
in
a
probate
division
is
done
what
i
might
call
on
an
ex
parte
basis
because
many
times
the
interested
party
do
not
have
counsel,
they
rely
upon
counsel
for
the
personal
representative.
and
the
court
must
rely
upon
the
integrity,
upon
the
honesty
of
the
attorneys
presenting
matters
to
them.
and
whereas
in
this
case,
you
have
a
situation
where
a
fraudulent
will
was
presented
for
admission
and
sought
to
be
processed
while
the
court
has
a
real
problem
as
far
as
discipline
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
we
do
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
think
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
strictly
speaking,
the
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
doesn't
apply.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
they're
strictly
speaking
the
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
would
not
apply
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
a
criminal
contempt.
i
just
don't
think
it
would
apply,
its
not
a
crime.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
imagine
possibly
he
might
--
well,
that's
not
a
probability
actually
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
of
the
gravity
between
the
two.
i
mean
one
is
--
that
the
forgery
in
this
particular
instance
have
to
do
with
the
very
operation
of
the
court
whereas
certainly
the
murder
would
cause
a
disturbance
in
the
court
but
i
just
cannot
visualize
that
the
--
a
probate
judge
would
move
by
way
of
contempt
rather
than
have
it
in
turn,
the
matter
over
the
state
for
prosecution
under
the
murder
statute.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
gave
what
we
submit
as
a
good
practical
sound
reason
in
this
particular
context
and
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
understand
but
by
the
same
token,
that
probate
judge
down
there
has
to
serve
a
notice
upon
the
bar
that
he
cannot
tolerate
practices
such
as
we
had
here.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
think
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
would
be
as
effective.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
mean,
if
we
--
would
probably
feel
that
he
would
deliver
a
better
message
to
the
bar
then
refer
it
all
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
whether
we
want
to
call
it
feelings
or
what
or
convictions
but
those
are
his
views.
and
of
course,
here,
as
i
pointed
out
before
is
the
fact
that
the
proceedings
were
actually
initiated
by
the
error,
the
lawful
errors
themselves.
this
is
not
something
that
was
done
completely
on
his
own
volition.
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
which
would
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
fine?
which
would
be
worse?
disbarment.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
disbarment.
well,
i
think
all
of
us
as
lawyers
are
pretty
proud
of
our
license
and
we
do
not
want
to
be
placed
in
a
position
of
ever
losing
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
elements,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well
i
don't,
i
don't
know
whether
this
contempt
would
conform
the
fair
basis
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
against
civil?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
the
reason
that
it's
called
criminal
contempt
is
the
fact
that
the
court
as
an
agency
of
the
public
is
actually
in
the
--
is
the
agent
of
the
public
and
that
the
public's
dignity
is
offended
by
specific
conduct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
of
course
mr.
justice
black
we
are
assuming
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
--
personally
i'm
concerned,
it
would
be,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
are
you
speaking
of
disbarment
now
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
disbarment.
i
can't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it's
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
is
not,
no.
the
disbarment
proceedings
are
conducted
through
grievance
committees
of
the
bar
association
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
the
commissioners
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
it's
not
automatic
disbarment.
he
has
his
hearing
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
it's
not
even
that
sir.
and
he
asks
this
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
and
as
against
disbarment,
there
may
be
censure,
there
may
be
suspension
and
there
of
course
may
be
dismissal
of
charges.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
there
are
no
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
excuse
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
understand
he
is
actively
practicing
at
the
present
time.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
and
he's
practicing.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
proceedings
in
this
case
are
--
there's
nothing
extraordinary
about
it.
the
committee
is
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
a
call
from
the
secretary
about
10
days
ago
on
the
matter
and
that
is
usual
in
all
cases.
they
will
wait
until
the
case
is
finally
disposed
before
it
is
taken
up
by
the
committee
acting
on
behalf
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
the
reason
that
they
didn't
wait
there
for
this
case
to
be
decided
is
the
fact
that
they
are
moving
against
that
union
and
particularly
the
group
that
was
servicing
them
with
professional
legal
services
is
the
very
fact
which
gave
rise
of
the
case
as
i
recall
it.
you're
talking
about
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
say
the
--
i
mean
you
want
to
call
that
illegal
practice,
i
would
say
the
presentation
of
a
fraudulent
will
and
imposing
up
on
the
court
is
the
thing
which
brought
about
his
contempt
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
know
what
you're
getting
at
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
i
think
that
we
have
two
different
situations
in
the
steel
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
steel
workers
situation
gave
rise
to
the
lawsuit
which
eventually
wound
up
in
this
court.
whereas
this
case,
what
the
bar
association
is
doing
and
the
grievance
committee
specifically
is
waiting
for
the
final
determination.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yesterday
afternoon
when
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
analyzing
the
fast
law
of
the
question
specifically
the
green
and
the
barnett
cases
and
cheff,
he
made
a
statement
regarding
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
this
court
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg
with
which
we
do
not
agree.
this
court
will
recall
that
the
majority
in
both
green
and
the
barnett
is
held
at
criminal
contempts
are
not
crimes,
and
as
such,
they
do
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
--
either
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
third
article
of
the
federal
constitution.
then
counsel
moves
on
to
the
cheff
decision
and
suggest
to
this
court
that
an
important
modification
was
made
therein
by
the
majority
and
that
the
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
in
federal
cases
wherein
sentences
exceed
six
months
has
been
raised
to
a
constitutional
level.
we
have
read
that
that
is
an
argument
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
and
was
repeated
yesterday.
we
have
disagreed
with
that
argument
and
we
still
adhere
to
our
position
that
at
no
time
as
the
majority
of
this
court
ever
said
either
that
criminal
contempt
was
a
crime
and
that
as
such
it
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
third
article
of
the
federal
constitution.
cheff
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
contempts
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
criminal
code.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
there
is
not
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
i
don't,
i
don't.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
would
depend
upon
the
case.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
but
on
our
theory,
i
would
have
much
less
trouble
than
on
theirs.
i
like
to
take
your
example
one
step
further.
let
us
take
20
years
and
let
us
assume
that
the
man
was
given
a
jury
trial.
could
i
in
all
sincerity
and
honesty
stand
here
and
defend
that
sentence
of
20
years?
i
think
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
one
to
14.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
where
a
no
--
no
jury
trial?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
have
trouble
with
the
case
but
not
on
his
theory
but
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
approach
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
to
defend
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
then
under
the
doctrine
of
basic
fair
play
which
after
all
is
the
core
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
could
as
we
suggested
in
green.
examine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
here
had
abused
his
discretion.
it
is
our
view
that
after
this
court
examines
the
evidence
in
the
context
it
will
find
that
the
discretion
was
not
abused
in
sentencing
the
gentleman
with
two
years.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
we
have
a
--
we
do
not
have
a
petty
offense.
we
have
a
misdemeanor
which
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
punishment
that
is
anything
a
year
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
but
they
are
--
accord
a
jury
trials,
when
they
request
them,
they
accord
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
jury
courts
in
the
police
level.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
on
request.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
he
can
either
request
it
or
waive
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
it
is
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
i
understand
it
sir,
he
has
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
he
receives
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
i
said
the
same
thing
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
when
i
said
he
may,
what
i
meant
was
that
he
can
request
it
and
then
receive
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes
but
of
course
the
waiver
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
none.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
didn't
intend
to
setup
any
distinction.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
observation.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
he's
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
could
be,
yes.
that
would
be
dependent
upon
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
their
disciplinary
proceedings.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
if
he
requested
it,
he
would
get
it.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
whether
we
call
it
anachronism
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
contempt
has
always
been
regarded.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there
--
i
will
concede
that
there
is
difficulty
on
the
part
of
someone
to
accept
the
prevailing
view
that
it
is
sui
generis
and
does
enjoy
this
unique
position.
there
are
as
you
well
know
mr.
justice
black,
those
who
feel
that
it
should
be
equated
to
the
status
of
a
crime
and
that
all
the
privileges
should
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
substantially,
what
the
federal
constitution
says
that
the
--
in
crimes
that
the
people
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
recall,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
gentlemen.
thank
you
very
much.
