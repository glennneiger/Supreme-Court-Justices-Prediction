what

here?
chief

earl
warren
what
was
the
punishment
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wasn't
there
a
statute
in
green?
and
i
thought
there
was
a
statute
in
green
and
it
was
one
year
penalty
but
the
court
gave
him
five
years
for
contempt,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
subject
of
the
contempt
also
that
he
had
jumped
his
bail
and
did
not
report
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief

oh,
i'm

well,
then

mr.
eben
have
you
concluded
your
argument,
you
have?
had
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
understood
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
a
challenge
at
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
a
challenge
at
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
a
challenge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
he
did
at
some
time
challenge
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there
is
an
uproar
in
the
court
then,
someone
was
murdered
and
the
judge
determined
instead
of
having
him
indicted
--
a
person
indicted
for
murder,
he
charge
him
with
criminal
contempt,
could
he
try
him
for
the
murder
and
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
is
it?
this
--
what's
the
difference
between
forgery
and
murder
if
they're
both
statutory
crimes
and
they
are
felonies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
we're
here
today.
some
people
think
that
forgery
is
a
pretty
important
case
and
particularly
when
a
man
goes
to
jail
for
--
goes
to
penitentiary
for
years
and
they
think
they
can't
understand
why
it
should
be
done
in
this
way
rather
than
give
a
man
a
jury
after
an
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
not
dealing
with
practical
reasons,
particularly
we're
dealing
with
the
law
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
think
it
wouldn't
be
serving
a
notice
on
them
if
he
called
it
detention
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
indict
him
and
he
was
convicted
of
forgery
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
on
what
you
say
is
absolutely
conclusive
evidence,
wouldn't
he
trust
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
he
uses
his
personal
feelings
in
the
matter
to
determine
whether
he
wants
to
punish
him
on
his
own
trial
rather
than
to
trust
it
to
a
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
man
disbarred?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
just
got
two
years
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
if
the
--
if
that
the
prime
concern
of
the
court
was
that
the
dignity
of
the
profession
and
the
dignity
of
the
court
should
be
upheld
and
he
went
so
far
as
to
deprive
a
man
of
a
jury
trial
and
an
indictment
--
a
trial
after
an
indictment,
he
would
do
this
and
not
pursue
it
further
and
not
having
a
disbarment
proceeding.
why
would
that
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
just
had
one
here
the
other
day
where
the
bar
of
illinois
moved
against
a
person
who
never
have
had
any
charge
against
him.
i'm
speaking
of
steel
workers
union
case
here.
and
we
had
to
reverse
that
case
but
they
didn't
wait
there
for
this
case
to
be
decided
and
the
person
hadn't
committed
any
crime.
but
he
just
said
that
he
was
violating
the
ethics
of
the
profession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
the
illegal
practice
of
the
law
here
the
very
thing
that
caused
his
trial
for
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
well,
that's
--
let's
phrase
it
your
way
but
isn't
that
just
as
important
as
certainly
is
the
one
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
this,
you
started
your
whole
argument
by
saying
that
the
judge
was
so
concerned
with
the
honorable
practice
of
law
in
his
court
and
the
bar
was
so
interested
in
the
ethics
of
the
profession
that
the
court
appointed
an
amicus
to
go
out
and
investigate
this
whole
thing
and
they
found
that
he
had
perpetrated
this
fraud
upon
the
court.
and
now
if
that
is
true
why
wouldn't
the
bar
move
there
when
he
was
convicted
in
the
court
below
and
when
he
was
convicted
by
your
supreme
court
just
as
they
did
in
the
steel
workers
case
where
there
wasn't
any
charge
of
fraud
at
all,
it
was
just
illegal
practice
of
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
they
are
different
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
illinois
it's
discretionary
with
the
court
as
to
whether
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
be
given
a
jury
in
a
misdemeanor
case
or
does
he
have
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial
if
he
wants
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
is
entitled
to
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
misdemeanor
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
little
different,
isn't
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
what
you
just
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no.
you
said
he
may
have
one,
but
it's
different,
he's
entitled
to
one
if
he
wants
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
permit
defendants
to
be
tried
by
--
without
a
jury
in
felony
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what's
the
difference?
he
demands
it
from
both
of
them,
he
gets
it.
he
demands
a
felony
case,
he
gets
it.
if
he
demands
a
misdemeanor,
he
gets
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
thought
the
import
of
what
you
said
to
justice
fortas
was
a
little
different
as
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
i'm
mistaken
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis,
does
your
illinois
constitution
have
a
jury
trial
probation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
make
any
distinction
between
misdemeanors
and
felonies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
does
your
judge
made
law
make
any
distinction
between
it.

would

how
