it's

his

you
say
that

justice

well,
why
do
they
call
it
criminal?
justice

why
is
it
called
criminal
contempt?
justice

and
it's
taking
away
from

if
he
is
disbarred,
is
it
not?
far
more
that
it

how
can
you
not
face
the
fact
as
it
is,
that
it
amount
everywhere

the
fact
here
is
that
in

you
do

what

case
to
a
man
where
all
admit
that
the

you
take

out

deny
him
a

trial?
that's
the
fact,
isn't
it?
justice

he

he
could

may

ask
