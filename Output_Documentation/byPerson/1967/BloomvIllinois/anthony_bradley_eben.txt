mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
each
time
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
appearing
before
this
court,
i
have
taken
the
liberty
at
the
outset
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
i
am
somewhat
hard
of
hearing.
and
each
time
in
the
past
when
i
have
done
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
invariably
would
ask
me
whether
or
not
i
made
that
statement
in
order
to
avoid
having
the
court
ask
me
any
questions
and
each
time,
i
always
replied
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
i'm
welcome
to
questions
and
that
i
only
make
the
statement
to
the
end
that
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
little
if
i
do
not
seem
to
--
at
first,
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
to
me.
this
case
your
honors
again,
brings
to
this
court
the
troublesome
question
and
i
say
troublesome
because
it
has
bothered
the
court
in
the
past
on
three
separate
occasions.
the
question
deals
with
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
as
the
court
will
recall,
this
matter
has
come
before
your
honors
in
the
past
as
recently
as
in
cheff
v.
schnackenberg,
and
prior
to
that
in
the
barnett
case
and
prior
to
that
in
the
green
case.
in
every
instance,
the
court
has
split
one
way
or
another
and
have
stated
their
diverge
views
with
great
strength.
the
matter
actually
comes
here
now
upon
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
review
a
judgment
by
that
court
which
affirmed
a
judgment
added
in
the
probate
court
of
cook
county
against
the
petitioner
who
was
charged
with
criminal
contempt
of
that
court.
now
the
conduct
upon
which
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
trial
in
that
court
related
to
his
alleged
filing
in
the
court
of
a
spurious
will,
a
will
alleged
in
the
pleadings
to
have
been
prepared
by
the
petitioner
subsequent
to
the
death
of
the
decedent.
the
petitioner
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
illinois
actually.
in
the
pleading,
it
is
said
that
he
prepared
this
in
his
office
with
the
aid
of
his
stenographer
that
thereafter
he
procured
witnesses
who
signed
it
after
the
death
of
the
decedent
that
he
then
filed
the
will
with
the
clerk,
with
probate
court
and
that
he
then
presented
it
for
admission.
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
we
asked
for
a
jury.
our
request
for
a
jury
was
timely
at
the
illinois
law.
the
trial
judge
saw
fit
to
deny
that
request
and
the
trial
was
then
entered
upon
and
consumed
approximately
10
days.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
all
of
those
matters
which
i
have
already
described
to
the
court.
and
the
order
recited
that
he
was
in
delegation
of
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
of
the
orderly
processes
of
the
court.
also
during
the
trial,
a
fact
issue
was
raised
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
petitioner.
that
fact
issue
was
raised
by
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist
who
testified
that
a
part
of
his
examination
of
petitioner
and
upon
a
hypothetical
question
that
the
petitioner
could
not
possibly
have
possessed
the
benevolent
intent
which
is
necessary
at
the
state
of
illinois
to
support
a
charge
of
criminal
contempt.
the
portion
of
this
case
which
makes
it
somewhat
different
than
the
cases
which
have
come
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
past
lies
in
the
fact
here
that
the
conduct
complaint
of
as
pleaded
in
the
petition
constitutes
a
felony
under
the
criminal
code
of
the
state
of
illinois
of
1961.
it
constitutes
a
felony
under
the
provisions
of
section
17-3
of
that
code
which
to
deals
with
forgery
and
makes
it
a
felony
punishable
by
a
sentence
of
one
to
14
years
for
one
who
utters
knowingly
a
forged
document.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry,
what?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
two
years
in
the
common
jail
of
cook
county
and
is
presently
at
large
on
bail
pending
his
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
then
the
grant
of
certiorari
here.
now,
the
case
also
presents
two
other
constitutional
questions
which
i
hope
to
come
to
later
because
i
would
like
to
have
the
main
impact
of
my
argument
centered
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
this
type
of
case.
but
at
passing,
so
that
it
will
come
as
no
surprise
to
the
court,
we
also
alleged
that
the
trial
judge
had
a
secret
report
furnished
him
by
an
amicus
curiae
who
was
appointed
by
him
and
that
this
report
was
only
made
limitedly
available
to
us
at
the
trial
and
not
at
its
entirety.
and
the
third
constitutional
point
deals
with
the
question
of
a
comment
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
conclusion
of
the
summary
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case
have
failed
to
take
the
stand.
i
do
not
wish
to
take
up
the
time
of
this
court
needlessly
to
explain
to
the
court
that
which
i
know
it
already
knows.
i
am
sure
that
this
court
is
much
more
familiar
with
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
black.
in
fact,
the
number
of
dissent
of
mr.
justice
black
in
this
field
and
his
presentation
of
all
of
the
reasons
why
upon
a
consideration
of
ancient
law,
magna
carta,
the
statutes
prevailing
in
the
13
colonies.
a
review
of
ancient
common
law
english
decisions
and
so
on.
why
he
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
just
no
reason
in
logic
why
a
criminal
contempt
of
any
sort
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
crime
or
a
criminal
prosecution
and
therefore
subject
to
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
elegant
treatment
has
been
given
to
the
same
subject
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
dissent
in
the
barnett
case
and
mr.
justice
douglas
from
time
to
time
has
made
references
in
dissents
to
this.
on
the
other
hand
as
the
court
knows
mr.
justice
harlan
has
consistently
taken
a
position
in
opposition
to
the
theory
which
we
now
propose.
but
i
thought
that
the
basis
for
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinions
in
the
past
is
somewhat
--
maybe
distinguished
here
since
in
green
and
in
barnett
the
two
cases
prior
to
cheff,
there
was
never
any
question
of
the
conduct
complained
off
in
those
cases
constituting
a
felony
as
this
particular
conduct
does
here.
as
of
felony
of
course,
the
petitioner
might
well
have
been
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
on
which
event
at
the
illinois
law
and
under
the
illinois
constitution,
it
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
green
as
i
recall
the
facts
your
honor,
the
--
there
had
been
jumping
of
bail
and
you're
quite
right.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and
there
was
a
one
year
penalty
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
but
that
of
course
was
not
a
felony.
that
would
be
at
least
a
misdemeanor
if
the
penalty
is
only
one
year.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
he
jumped
there
then
they
were
brought
back
and
then
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
--
given
him
five
years
on
the
contempt
charge.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
quite
correct.
now
it
seems
to
me
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
that's
what
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
say.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and
i
concede
that
there
was
such
a
statute.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
cheff,
which
was
the
last
time
these
troubles
and
problem
came
here,
six
of
the
justices
seemed
for
one
reason
or
another
to
be
on
the
side
which
i
now
proposed.
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
quite
consistently
adhered
to
their
prior
dissents.
four
other
justices,
however,
consisting
of
the
chief
justice
i
believe,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
recall
took
the
position
that
where
or
rather
they
equate
and
i
should
say,
a
criminal
contempt
to
a
petty
crime
and
then
taking
the
petty
crime
which
is
defined
under
the
appropriate
united
states
statute,
i
believe
it's
18
u.s.c
1.
i
found
there
that
the
maximum
penalty
to
constitute
a
petty
crime
was
six
months
and
concluding
that
upon
the
equation
which
i
just
mentioned
that
therefore
it
is
constitutionally
possible
to
impose
a
sentence
in
a
case
where
a
disobedience
of
the
court
order
was
involved
which
did
not
exceed
six
months.
but
nevertheless,
a
caveat
was
published
to
the
lower
courts
which
in
the
language
of
this
court
seem
to
indicate
that
lower
courts
could
not
sentence
to
more
than
six
months
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
and
if
they
intended
to
sentence
for
a
longer
period
of
time
then
a
jury
trial
was
required.
my
distinguished
adversaries
from
the
state
of
illinois
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
finding
by
this
court
and
was
merely
an
exercise
of
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
court.
i
of
course
contend
the
opposite
and
i
say
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
this
court
no
matter
what
it
called
it
to
have
decided
the
question
presented
in
cheff
without
as
a
matter
of
logic
deciding
when
the
issue
of
this
caveat
that
any
punishment
more
than
six
months
was
unconstitutional
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
iii.
we
have
briefed
this
fully
as
has
the
state.
now
then,
it
seems
also
to
me
as
a
matter
of
reasoning
that
there
is
just
no
reason
whatsoever
why
a
criminal
contempt
should
ever
be
considered
in
any
manner
different
from
the
ordinary
crime
or
criminal
prosecution.
for
instance,
in
the
past,
this
court
as
well
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
had
held
that
a
--
an
alleged
contemnor
is
entitled
to
any
number
of
rights
all
of
which
are
granted
to
him
only
in
the
event
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
for
instance,
under
decisions
here
and
under
decisions
of
the
state
of
illinois
an
alleged
contemnor
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
he
is
entitled
to
the
application
of
the
rule
that
he
must
be
proved
guilty
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt,
self
incrimination
is
not
permitted.
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
prepare
for
trial,
he
must
be
given
notices
of
the
charges
against
him,
he
has
a
right
to
an
impartial
arbiter
of
the
facts,
he
has
the
benefit
of
statutes
of
limitations
covering
crimes
and
finally
under
these
decisions,
he
has
the
right
to
petition
for
pardon.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
just
no
logic
to
support
the
theory
that
a
criminal
prosecution
at
any
way
differs
from
a
crime
and
more
importantly
because
i
do
not
wish
to
overstate
my
own
case,
more
importantly
where
the
conduct
charge
actually
does
as
it
is
here
does
constitute
a
crime.
now,
there
is
another
reason
which
seems
to
me
logically
to
support
our
position
and
that
is
by
an
analysis
which
i
will
make
very
briefly
of
why
a
court
has
a
contempt
power
at
all.
and
there
are
decisions
after
decisions
saying
that
courts
have
this
power
in
order
to
protect
themselves.
that
is
to
protect
themselves
from
insult
and
contumacy
committed
in
their
presence
or
to
enforce
their
judgments
and
so
on.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
early
decisions
that
indicate
that
the
power
of
contempt
as
they
said
should
be
the
least
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
i
believe
that
was
in
a
very
early
decision
of
this
court
to
this
case,
the
bessette
case.
and
so,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
power
--
the
contempt
power
should
be
used
sparingly
and
in
my
humble
opinion
only
where
it
is
necessary
and
under
the
fact
situation
as
it
is
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
exercise
of
the
contempt
power
is
not
necessary
at
all.
that
is
by
a
court.
since
the
court
is
given
adequate
protection
by
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county
in
this
particular
instance
who
may
proceed
upon
the
criminal
conduct
and
bring
the
man
to
trial
which
as
i
have
said
before
would
entitle
him
to
a
jury.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
sorry.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
would
be
--
that
raises
the
question
mr.
justice
white
of
the
--
where
the
penalty
is
a
trivial
one.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
they
could
still
proceed
--
if
this
is
what
you're
asking
me.
they
could
still
proceed
by
a
way
of
criminal
indictment.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
since
there
are
no
double
jeopardy
protections
on
this
as
you
know
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
which
is
one
of
the
dangers
by
the
way
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir.
i
believe
that's
what
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
because
i
believe
along
with
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
that
unless
the
legislature
at
some
point
makes
the
difference
between
--
the
state's
difference
between
what
is
petty
and
what
is
not
petty
that
all
criminal
contempt
must
be
considered
the
same.
we
do
have
that
federally
though
we
do
not
have
it
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
must
point
out
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
is
no
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
petty
crime.
under
the
criminal
code
there,
the
petty
--
crimes
are
--
consists
of
misdemeanors
and
felonies
and
that
is
all
which
is
why
i
would
ask
in
this
case,
should
the
court
see
fit
to
go
along
with
our
brief
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
a
new
trial
rather
than
for
the
imposition
of
any
six
months
sentence
as
was
done
in
cheff.
foreclosed,
you
know
i
see
the
hour
is
getting
close.
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
secret
report
which
had
been
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
to
the
judge.
we
believe
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
in
re
murchison
which
dealt
with
the
one
man
grand
jury
in
michigan
and
in
re
oliver
also
dealing
with
the
same
situation
that
it
a
--
is
just
constitutionally
wrong
for
a
judge
at
any
time
to
have
access
to
reports
whether
from
his
own
agent
as
in
this
case
in
amicus
curiae
or
anyone
else
in
his
possession
prior
to
the
trial
and
we
believe
that
this
is
what
the
record
establishes
here.
i'd
like
with
the
permission
of
the
court
to
stop
at
this
point.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
tomorrow
for
my
rebuttal.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
as
i
have
asked
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thanks.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
may
i
please
the
court.
i
had
terminated
my
opening
as
of
yesterday.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
chief
justice's
last
question
we
have
set
forth
the
exact
constitutional
provisions
of
the
illinois
statute
on
page
2
of
our
original
brief
in
this
court.
there
are
two
sections
really
which
covered
in
illinois.
article
ii,
section
5
provides
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
as
here
before
enjoined
shall
remain
in
(inaudible).
article
ii,
section
9
says,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
have
the
right
to
a
speedy
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
nevertheless
in
illinois
over
the
years,
there
has
grown
up
a
body
of
law
which
i
frankly
concedes
to
the
court
which
has
consistently
withheld
from
criminal
contender's
a
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
which
i
analyzed
incidentally
in
my
brief
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
to
show
that
it
grew
as
somewhat
in
topsy
like
fashion
and
was
based
upon
a
forced
premise
which
originated
in
a
pure
civil
contempt
case
where
of
course
it's
quite
proper
to
deny
trials
by
jury.
and
based
upon
that
fragile
basis,
they
grew
with
illinois
the
body
of
law
to
which
i
have
just
referred
and
to
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
still
adheres
in
this
case
dismissing
the
holding
of
this
court
in
cheff
v.
schnackenberg
with
--
i
use
to
word
advisedly
to
stay
in
almost
making
only
passing
reference
to
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
i
would
say
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice
harlan.
up
until
now,
they
have
adhere
to
green
and
barnett
and
in
fact
rely
upon
it
again
in
their
decision
in
this
case,
the
case
at
bar.
and
we're
critical
of
that
of
course
when
we
say
that
they
have
failed
to
recognize
the
important
modifications
in
green
and
barnett
as
now
written
by
this
court
in
cheff.
incidentally,
i
revisited
green
after
the
colloquy
i
had
with
the
court
yesterday
and
i
am
able
to
say
that
the
court
that
there
was
no
criminal
statute
involved
in
green
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
contemptuous
acts.
the
defendant
there
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
jumped
and
he
refused
to
obey
an
order.
as
he
jumped
down,
he
refused
to
obey
an
order
to
surrender
and
he
was
tried
on
contempt
for
disobedience
of
that
order.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
wrote
in
the
majority
opinion
of
that
case,
he
observed
that
the
bail
jumping
statute
had
not
yet
been
enacted.
it
had
been
enacted
in
1990
--
in
1954
whereas
the
contemptuous
acts
--
the
acts
complained
off
occurred
in
1951
and
passed
it
on
to
the
court
because
i
received
the
impression
probably
incorrectly
yesterday
that
there
was
a
contention
that
there
was
a
criminal
statute
at
to
time.one
other
thing,
counsel
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
we
conceded
guilt.
and
mr.
justice
white's
observation
on
it
of
course
i
thought
was
quite
correct.
that
is
that
we
contested
right
from
the
very
beginning
of
course
by
reason
of
our
plea
of
not
guilty.
but
when
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
upon
the
record,
i
did
not
plan
to
engage
in
a
long
argument
based
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
since
the
trial
judge
waived
the
evidence.
he
was
the
trier
of
the
fact,
he
waived
the
evidence,
he
judged
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
so
on.
oh,
i
did
not,
however
concede
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
that
there
was
just
no
other
side
to
it.
i
said
incidentally
in
brief
that
the
page
referred
to
by
mr.
hladis,
in
a
footnote
that
the
defendant
concedes
that
the
people's
evidence
when
viewed
on
appeal
as
it
must
be
viewed
on
appeal
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
people
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
court's
judgment
because
it's
quite
true.
and
i
also
said
in
our
brief
here
on
page
2,
i
said
the
petitioner
did
not
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
view
of
the
rule
prevailing
in
that
state
that
a
verdict
will
not
be
disturbed
on
appeal
when
there
is
any
evidence
which
when
taken
with
its
intendments
most
favorable
to
an
appellee
tends
to
prove
the
essential
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i
would,
i
submit
most
respectfully
to
the
court
that
a
complete
waste
of
time
to
me
on
this
record
to
go
up
and
say
that
our
psychiatrist
should
have
been
believed,
the
psychiatric
evidence
established.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
says
that
the
malevolent
intent
necessary
to
a
criminal
contempt
was
not
shown
but
we
had
an
attorney
who
represented
an
adversary
party
in
the
trial
court
proceedings
testified
in
the
trial.
a
cross-examination
that
when
he
thought
with
the
petitioner
prior
to
the
time
that
he
would
open
or
present
the
spurious
will,
he
was
convinced
and
this
is
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
did
not
realize
the
involvements
he
was
getting
into.
it
did
not
have
the
mind,
my
own
language
to
understand
his
predicament
at
that
time.
all
of
which
within,
but
this
was
disregarded
of
course
by
the
trial
court.
and
i
point
out
although
it
--
only
been
touched
on
briefly
by
mr.
hladis
that
one
of
the
complications
in
this
case
is
this
amicus
curiae
secret
report
which
we
have
referred
to
as
the
fink
report
since
the
amicus
curiae
was
a
mr.
fink.
i
like
to
think
that
the
word
is
descriptive
incidentally
by
the
card
here
but
in
any
event,
the
--
that
report
found
its
way
into
the
trial
court's
chambers.
it
was
viewed
there
in
camera
and
he
has
refused
to
make
it
part
of
the
record
here
in
this
case
although
we
asked
for
an
order
on
it.
so
it
still
remains
secret.
we
don't
know
what's
in
it.
and
it
compounds
the
fact
that
we
would
deny
the
jury.
had
we
had
a
jury
would
be
bad
enough
for
the
trial
court
to
have
such
a
report
anyway
if
you
can
visualize
a
federal
district
court
judge
with
fbi
reports
at
his
chambers
before
he
proceeds
to
a
trial
--
a
case
if
it's
so
much
similar
to
this.
but
where
the
trier
of
the
fact
is
that
person
and
i
think
additional
emphasis
should
be
given
to
(inaudible)
and
that
is
one
of
the
errors
we
complained
about.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir.
the
proceeding
originally
began
in
the
probate
court
of
cook
county
upon
the
presentation
of
a
petition
to
the
court
by
--
as
under
a
prior
will
who
would
have
been
out
under
the
spurious
will.
in
it,
they
alleged
and
it's
in
the
record
incidentally
with
--
and
you
can
refer
to
it
at
the
proper
time.
in
it,
they
alleged
that
they
sought
fraud
was
being
perpetrated
upon
the
court
by
the
presentation
of
this
other
will
and
they
specifically
asked
the
trial
court
for
the
appointment
of
an
amicus
curiae
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
and
prosecuting
if
necessary
the
fraud
involved.
the
trial
court
read
at
that
motion
and
appointed
mr.
fink.
thereafter,
i
think
within
approximately
60
or
90
days,
the
trial
court
entered
an
order
upon
the
amicus
curiae
requiring
him
to
file
his
report
with
the
trial
court
and
such
a
report
was
filed
and
was
held
in
camera
by
the
court.
now
the
record
incidentally
on
that
shows
when
we
made
a
demand
for
it
prior
to
trial
and
then
again
at
trial,
now
the
court,
page
81
of
the
record
said,
“it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
it
belongs
to
the
court
itself
and
the
court
will
turn
it
over
to
you
and
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
read
it
as
concerns
any
witnesses
testimony.
the
court
wants
to
get
at
the
truth
or
falsity
at
the
proceeding
so
i
will
turn
it
over
to
you
and
you
may
use
it
for
cross-examination”.
and
it
was,
portions
of
it
were
turned
over
to
me
somewhat
in
jenks
style,
that
is
where
a
witness
took
the
stand
who
was
referred
to
in
the
fink
report
then
i
was
entitled
to
cross-examine
there
on
the
basis
of
that.
but
that
was
not
the
entire
report.
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
show
it
to
the
court
where
--
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
indicate
to
the
court
whether
or
not
we
are
prejudiced
which
was
the
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
for
denying
us
a
relief
in
that
--
in
connection
with
this
particular
point
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
here
for
us
to
get
such
a
report
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
had
been
prejudiced
since
the
trial
judge
himself
to
which
(inaudible)
significance,
refused
to
give
it
to
us
and
refused
to
put
it
in
the
record.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
we
cannot
tell
mr.
justice
black.
we
cannot
tell.
i
do
not
know
frankly
what
use
was
made
of
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
afterwards,
it
was
filed
by
the
state's
attorney
and
there
were
series
of
them.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
first
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir,
that's
represented
by
mr.
hladis.
the
--
after
this
petition
to
which
i
referred
to
before
have
been
filed
then
and
after
the
fink
report
have
been
filed
then
there
was
a
petition
filed
by
the
state's
attorney
seeking
to
have
the
petitioner
to
show
cause
why
it
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
thereafter,
they
filed
an
amended
petition
after
that
had
been
attacked
and
it
was
upon
the
amended
petition
that
the
trial
ultimately
was
had.
but
in
direct
answer
to
your
honor,
the
petitions
relating
to
contempt
were
filed
after
the
receipt
of
the
so-called
fink
report.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir,
no
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
think
that
it
might
but
not
the
appellate
court
but
if
you
use
it
in
a
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
--
particular
sentence
made
by
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
unless
a
constitutional
question
is
involved.
we
went
directly
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
wrote
a
part
of
my
brief
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
that
point
asking
them
to
at
least
reduce
the
sentence
to
conform
with
this
court's
decision
in
cheff.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
although
i'm
not
sure
that
my
position
is
really
too
sound
because
in
cheff
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
you
do
have
that
section
18,
title
i
defining
petty
crimes
and
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
illinois
at
all.
a
defense
is
either
a
misdemeanor
or
it's
a
felony.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir.
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
they
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
the
two-year
sentence
without
considering
the
facet
which
your
honors
is
now
discussing.
they
discussed
it
in
terms
of
cheff
and
they
said
really
that
what
a
sentence
is,
it's
not
at
all
relevant
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
a
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
my
case
depends
upon
if
i
understood
your
honor
correctly,
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
state
courts
in
a
long
line
of
decisions.
i
think
i
counted
23
of
this
court
in
the
last
few
years
as
well
as
an
application
of
recently
written
by
the
court
in
which
you
for
the
first
time
so
far
as
i
know,
reach
out
to
define
what
criminal
proceedings
are
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
constitutional
rights
at
the
bar
association
disciplinary
proceedings.
the
juvenile
proceedings,
the
colorado
sex
offenses
if
you
remember
which
were
regarded
as
civil
there,
i
know
its
three
or
four
others
which
you
--
this
court
now
regards
as
criminal
in
the
sense
that
they
require
the
application
of
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
i
say
of
course
if
in
a
disbarment
proceeding
or
even
a
proceeding
where
a
man
loses
his
license
under
a
municipal
ordinance
which
this
court
has
decided
if
that
is
to
be
considered
criminal
providing
for
the
application
of
constitutional
rights
then
certainly
conduct
which
is
labeled
right
at
the
name
criminal
contempt
and
which
of
itself
constitutes
the
violation
of
the
state
statute
is
felony
should
certainly
be
considered
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
my
answer
is
to
the
affirmative.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
involved.
i
have
struggled
with
it
and
that
has
not
yet
occurred
to
by
mind
a
way
in
which
the
problem
could
be
treated
without
applying
the
constitutional
inhibition
to
the
states
and
the
only
way
i
think
we
could
do
that
would
be
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
would
certainly
accept
that
as
the
alternative.
if
i
understand
your
honor,
i
think
you're
referring
to
an
interpretation
of
the
illinois
constitution
rather
than
the
federal
constitution
would
be,
yes,
i'll
accept
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
each
time
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
appearing
before
this
court,
i
have
taken
the
liberty
at
the
outset
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
i
am
somewhat
hard
of
hearing.
and
each
time
in
the
past
when
i
have
done
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
invariably
would
ask
me
whether
or
not
i
made
that
statement
in
order
to
avoid
having
the
court
ask
me
any
questions
and
each
time,
i
always
replied
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
i'm
welcome
to
questions
and
that
i
only
make
the
statement
to
the
end
that
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
little
if
i
do
not
seem
to
--
at
first,
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
to
me.
this
case
your
honors
again,
brings
to
this
court
the
troublesome
question
and
i
say
troublesome
because
it
has
bothered
the
court
in
the
past
on
three
separate
occasions.
the
question
deals
with
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
as
the
court
will
recall,
this
matter
has
come
before
your
honors
in
the
past
as
recently
as
in
cheff
v.
schnackenberg,
and
prior
to
that
in
the
barnett
case
and
prior
to
that
in
the
green
case.
in
every
instance,
the
court
has
split
one
way
or
another
and
have
stated
their
diverge
views
with
great
strength.
the
matter
actually
comes
here
now
upon
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
review
a
judgment
by
that
court
which
affirmed
a
judgment
added
in
the
probate
court
of
cook
county
against
the
petitioner
who
was
charged
with
criminal
contempt
of
that
court.
now
the
conduct
upon
which
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
trial
in
that
court
related
to
his
alleged
filing
in
the
court
of
a
spurious
will,
a
will
alleged
in
the
pleadings
to
have
been
prepared
by
the
petitioner
subsequent
to
the
death
of
the
decedent.
the
petitioner
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
illinois
actually.
in
the
pleading,
it
is
said
that
he
prepared
this
in
his
office
with
the
aid
of
his
stenographer
that
thereafter
he
procured
witnesses
who
signed
it
after
the
death
of
the
decedent
that
he
then
filed
the
will
with
the
clerk,
with
probate
court
and
that
he
then
presented
it
for
admission.
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
we
asked
for
a
jury.
our
request
for
a
jury
was
timely
at
the
illinois
law.
the
trial
judge
saw
fit
to
deny
that
request
and
the
trial
was
then
entered
upon
and
consumed
approximately
10
days.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
all
of
those
matters
which
i
have
already
described
to
the
court.
and
the
order
recited
that
he
was
in
delegation
of
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
of
the
orderly
processes
of
the
court.
also
during
the
trial,
a
fact
issue
was
raised
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
petitioner.
that
fact
issue
was
raised
by
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist
who
testified
that
a
part
of
his
examination
of
petitioner
and
upon
a
hypothetical
question
that
the
petitioner
could
not
possibly
have
possessed
the
benevolent
intent
which
is
necessary
at
the
state
of
illinois
to
support
a
charge
of
criminal
contempt.
the
portion
of
this
case
which
makes
it
somewhat
different
than
the
cases
which
have
come
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
past
lies
in
the
fact
here
that
the
conduct
complaint
of
as
pleaded
in
the
petition
constitutes
a
felony
under
the
criminal
code
of
the
state
of
illinois
of
1961.
it
constitutes
a
felony
under
the
provisions
of
section
17-3
of
that
code
which
to
deals
with
forgery
and
makes
it
a
felony
punishable
by
a
sentence
of
one
to
14
years
for
one
who
utters
knowingly
a
forged
document.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry,
what?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
two
years
in
the
common
jail
of
cook
county
and
is
presently
at
large
on
bail
pending
his
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
then
the
grant
of
certiorari
here.
now,
the
case
also
presents
two
other
constitutional
questions
which
i
hope
to
come
to
later
because
i
would
like
to
have
the
main
impact
of
my
argument
centered
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
this
type
of
case.
but
at
passing,
so
that
it
will
come
as
no
surprise
to
the
court,
we
also
alleged
that
the
trial
judge
had
a
secret
report
furnished
him
by
an
amicus
curiae
who
was
appointed
by
him
and
that
this
report
was
only
made
limitedly
available
to
us
at
the
trial
and
not
at
its
entirety.
and
the
third
constitutional
point
deals
with
the
question
of
a
comment
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
conclusion
of
the
summary
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case
have
failed
to
take
the
stand.
i
do
not
wish
to
take
up
the
time
of
this
court
needlessly
to
explain
to
the
court
that
which
i
know
it
already
knows.
i
am
sure
that
this
court
is
much
more
familiar
with
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
black.
in
fact,
the
number
of
dissent
of
mr.
justice
black
in
this
field
and
his
presentation
of
all
of
the
reasons
why
upon
a
consideration
of
ancient
law,
magna
carta,
the
statutes
prevailing
in
the
13
colonies.
a
review
of
ancient
common
law
english
decisions
and
so
on.
why
he
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
just
no
reason
in
logic
why
a
criminal
contempt
of
any
sort
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
crime
or
a
criminal
prosecution
and
therefore
subject
to
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
elegant
treatment
has
been
given
to
the
same
subject
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
dissent
in
the
barnett
case
and
mr.
justice
douglas
from
time
to
time
has
made
references
in
dissents
to
this.
on
the
other
hand
as
the
court
knows
mr.
justice
harlan
has
consistently
taken
a
position
in
opposition
to
the
theory
which
we
now
propose.
but
i
thought
that
the
basis
for
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinions
in
the
past
is
somewhat
--
maybe
distinguished
here
since
in
green
and
in
barnett
the
two
cases
prior
to
cheff,
there
was
never
any
question
of
the
conduct
complained
off
in
those
cases
constituting
a
felony
as
this
particular
conduct
does
here.
as
of
felony
of
course,
the
petitioner
might
well
have
been
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
on
which
event
at
the
illinois
law
and
under
the
illinois
constitution,
it
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
green
as
i
recall
the
facts
your
honor,
the
--
there
had
been
jumping
of
bail
and
you're
quite
right.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and
there
was
a
one
year
penalty
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
but
that
of
course
was
not
a
felony.
that
would
be
at
least
a
misdemeanor
if
the
penalty
is
only
one
year.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
he
jumped
there
then
they
were
brought
back
and
then
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
--
given
him
five
years
on
the
contempt
charge.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
quite
correct.
now
it
seems
to
me
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
that's
what
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
say.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and
i
concede
that
there
was
such
a
statute.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
cheff,
which
was
the
last
time
these
troubles
and
problem
came
here,
six
of
the
justices
seemed
for
one
reason
or
another
to
be
on
the
side
which
i
now
proposed.
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
quite
consistently
adhered
to
their
prior
dissents.
four
other
justices,
however,
consisting
of
the
chief
justice
i
believe,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
recall
took
the
position
that
where
or
rather
they
equate
and
i
should
say,
a
criminal
contempt
to
a
petty
crime
and
then
taking
the
petty
crime
which
is
defined
under
the
appropriate
united
states
statute,
i
believe
it's
18
u.s.c
1.
i
found
there
that
the
maximum
penalty
to
constitute
a
petty
crime
was
six
months
and
concluding
that
upon
the
equation
which
i
just
mentioned
that
therefore
it
is
constitutionally
possible
to
impose
a
sentence
in
a
case
where
a
disobedience
of
the
court
order
was
involved
which
did
not
exceed
six
months.
but
nevertheless,
a
caveat
was
published
to
the
lower
courts
which
in
the
language
of
this
court
seem
to
indicate
that
lower
courts
could
not
sentence
to
more
than
six
months
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
and
if
they
intended
to
sentence
for
a
longer
period
of
time
then
a
jury
trial
was
required.
my
distinguished
adversaries
from
the
state
of
illinois
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
finding
by
this
court
and
was
merely
an
exercise
of
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
court.
i
of
course
contend
the
opposite
and
i
say
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
this
court
no
matter
what
it
called
it
to
have
decided
the
question
presented
in
cheff
without
as
a
matter
of
logic
deciding
when
the
issue
of
this
caveat
that
any
punishment
more
than
six
months
was
unconstitutional
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
iii.
we
have
briefed
this
fully
as
has
the
state.
now
then,
it
seems
also
to
me
as
a
matter
of
reasoning
that
there
is
just
no
reason
whatsoever
why
a
criminal
contempt
should
ever
be
considered
in
any
manner
different
from
the
ordinary
crime
or
criminal
prosecution.
for
instance,
in
the
past,
this
court
as
well
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
had
held
that
a
--
an
alleged
contemnor
is
entitled
to
any
number
of
rights
all
of
which
are
granted
to
him
only
in
the
event
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
for
instance,
under
decisions
here
and
under
decisions
of
the
state
of
illinois
an
alleged
contemnor
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
he
is
entitled
to
the
application
of
the
rule
that
he
must
be
proved
guilty
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt,
self
incrimination
is
not
permitted.
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
prepare
for
trial,
he
must
be
given
notices
of
the
charges
against
him,
he
has
a
right
to
an
impartial
arbiter
of
the
facts,
he
has
the
benefit
of
statutes
of
limitations
covering
crimes
and
finally
under
these
decisions,
he
has
the
right
to
petition
for
pardon.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
just
no
logic
to
support
the
theory
that
a
criminal
prosecution
at
any
way
differs
from
a
crime
and
more
importantly
because
i
do
not
wish
to
overstate
my
own
case,
more
importantly
where
the
conduct
charge
actually
does
as
it
is
here
does
constitute
a
crime.
now,
there
is
another
reason
which
seems
to
me
logically
to
support
our
position
and
that
is
by
an
analysis
which
i
will
make
very
briefly
of
why
a
court
has
a
contempt
power
at
all.
and
there
are
decisions
after
decisions
saying
that
courts
have
this
power
in
order
to
protect
themselves.
that
is
to
protect
themselves
from
insult
and
contumacy
committed
in
their
presence
or
to
enforce
their
judgments
and
so
on.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
early
decisions
that
indicate
that
the
power
of
contempt
as
they
said
should
be
the
least
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
i
believe
that
was
in
a
very
early
decision
of
this
court
to
this
case,
the
bessette
case.
and
so,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
power
--
the
contempt
power
should
be
used
sparingly
and
in
my
humble
opinion
only
where
it
is
necessary
and
under
the
fact
situation
as
it
is
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
exercise
of
the
contempt
power
is
not
necessary
at
all.
that
is
by
a
court.
since
the
court
is
given
adequate
protection
by
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county
in
this
particular
instance
who
may
proceed
upon
the
criminal
conduct
and
bring
the
man
to
trial
which
as
i
have
said
before
would
entitle
him
to
a
jury.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
sorry.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
would
be
--
that
raises
the
question
mr.
justice
white
of
the
--
where
the
penalty
is
a
trivial
one.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
they
could
still
proceed
--
if
this
is
what
you're
asking
me.
they
could
still
proceed
by
a
way
of
criminal
indictment.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
since
there
are
no
double
jeopardy
protections
on
this
as
you
know
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
which
is
one
of
the
dangers
by
the
way
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir.
i
believe
that's
what
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
because
i
believe
along
with
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
that
unless
the
legislature
at
some
point
makes
the
difference
between
--
the
state's
difference
between
what
is
petty
and
what
is
not
petty
that
all
criminal
contempt
must
be
considered
the
same.
we
do
have
that
federally
though
we
do
not
have
it
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
must
point
out
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
is
no
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
petty
crime.
under
the
criminal
code
there,
the
petty
--
crimes
are
--
consists
of
misdemeanors
and
felonies
and
that
is
all
which
is
why
i
would
ask
in
this
case,
should
the
court
see
fit
to
go
along
with
our
brief
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
a
new
trial
rather
than
for
the
imposition
of
any
six
months
sentence
as
was
done
in
cheff.
foreclosed,
you
know
i
see
the
hour
is
getting
close.
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
secret
report
which
had
been
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
to
the
judge.
we
believe
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
in
re
murchison
which
dealt
with
the
one
man
grand
jury
in
michigan
and
in
re
oliver
also
dealing
with
the
same
situation
that
it
a
--
is
just
constitutionally
wrong
for
a
judge
at
any
time
to
have
access
to
reports
whether
from
his
own
agent
as
in
this
case
in
amicus
curiae
or
anyone
else
in
his
possession
prior
to
the
trial
and
we
believe
that
this
is
what
the
record
establishes
here.
i'd
like
with
the
permission
of
the
court
to
stop
at
this
point.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
tomorrow
for
my
rebuttal.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
as
i
have
asked
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thanks.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
may
i
please
the
court.
i
had
terminated
my
opening
as
of
yesterday.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
chief
justice's
last
question
we
have
set
forth
the
exact
constitutional
provisions
of
the
illinois
statute
on
page
2
of
our
original
brief
in
this
court.
there
are
two
sections
really
which
covered
in
illinois.
article
ii,
section
5
provides
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
as
here
before
enjoined
shall
remain
in
(inaudible).
article
ii,
section
9
says,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
have
the
right
to
a
speedy
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
nevertheless
in
illinois
over
the
years,
there
has
grown
up
a
body
of
law
which
i
frankly
concedes
to
the
court
which
has
consistently
withheld
from
criminal
contender's
a
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
which
i
analyzed
incidentally
in
my
brief
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
to
show
that
it
grew
as
somewhat
in
topsy
like
fashion
and
was
based
upon
a
forced
premise
which
originated
in
a
pure
civil
contempt
case
where
of
course
it's
quite
proper
to
deny
trials
by
jury.
and
based
upon
that
fragile
basis,
they
grew
with
illinois
the
body
of
law
to
which
i
have
just
referred
and
to
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
still
adheres
in
this
case
dismissing
the
holding
of
this
court
in
cheff
v.
schnackenberg
with
--
i
use
to
word
advisedly
to
stay
in
almost
making
only
passing
reference
to
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
i
would
say
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice
harlan.
up
until
now,
they
have
adhere
to
green
and
barnett
and
in
fact
rely
upon
it
again
in
their
decision
in
this
case,
the
case
at
bar.
and
we're
critical
of
that
of
course
when
we
say
that
they
have
failed
to
recognize
the
important
modifications
in
green
and
barnett
as
now
written
by
this
court
in
cheff.
incidentally,
i
revisited
green
after
the
colloquy
i
had
with
the
court
yesterday
and
i
am
able
to
say
that
the
court
that
there
was
no
criminal
statute
involved
in
green
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
contemptuous
acts.
the
defendant
there
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
jumped
and
he
refused
to
obey
an
order.
as
he
jumped
down,
he
refused
to
obey
an
order
to
surrender
and
he
was
tried
on
contempt
for
disobedience
of
that
order.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
wrote
in
the
majority
opinion
of
that
case,
he
observed
that
the
bail
jumping
statute
had
not
yet
been
enacted.
it
had
been
enacted
in
1990
--
in
1954
whereas
the
contemptuous
acts
--
the
acts
complained
off
occurred
in
1951
and
passed
it
on
to
the
court
because
i
received
the
impression
probably
incorrectly
yesterday
that
there
was
a
contention
that
there
was
a
criminal
statute
at
to
time.one
other
thing,
counsel
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
we
conceded
guilt.
and
mr.
justice
white's
observation
on
it
of
course
i
thought
was
quite
correct.
that
is
that
we
contested
right
from
the
very
beginning
of
course
by
reason
of
our
plea
of
not
guilty.
but
when
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
upon
the
record,
i
did
not
plan
to
engage
in
a
long
argument
based
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
since
the
trial
judge
waived
the
evidence.
he
was
the
trier
of
the
fact,
he
waived
the
evidence,
he
judged
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
so
on.
oh,
i
did
not,
however
concede
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
that
there
was
just
no
other
side
to
it.
i
said
incidentally
in
brief
that
the
page
referred
to
by
mr.
hladis,
in
a
footnote
that
the
defendant
concedes
that
the
people's
evidence
when
viewed
on
appeal
as
it
must
be
viewed
on
appeal
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
people
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
court's
judgment
because
it's
quite
true.
and
i
also
said
in
our
brief
here
on
page
2,
i
said
the
petitioner
did
not
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
view
of
the
rule
prevailing
in
that
state
that
a
verdict
will
not
be
disturbed
on
appeal
when
there
is
any
evidence
which
when
taken
with
its
intendments
most
favorable
to
an
appellee
tends
to
prove
the
essential
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i
would,
i
submit
most
respectfully
to
the
court
that
a
complete
waste
of
time
to
me
on
this
record
to
go
up
and
say
that
our
psychiatrist
should
have
been
believed,
the
psychiatric
evidence
established.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
says
that
the
malevolent
intent
necessary
to
a
criminal
contempt
was
not
shown
but
we
had
an
attorney
who
represented
an
adversary
party
in
the
trial
court
proceedings
testified
in
the
trial.
a
cross-examination
that
when
he
thought
with
the
petitioner
prior
to
the
time
that
he
would
open
or
present
the
spurious
will,
he
was
convinced
and
this
is
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
did
not
realize
the
involvements
he
was
getting
into.
it
did
not
have
the
mind,
my
own
language
to
understand
his
predicament
at
that
time.
all
of
which
within,
but
this
was
disregarded
of
course
by
the
trial
court.
and
i
point
out
although
it
--
only
been
touched
on
briefly
by
mr.
hladis
that
one
of
the
complications
in
this
case
is
this
amicus
curiae
secret
report
which
we
have
referred
to
as
the
fink
report
since
the
amicus
curiae
was
a
mr.
fink.
i
like
to
think
that
the
word
is
descriptive
incidentally
by
the
card
here
but
in
any
event,
the
--
that
report
found
its
way
into
the
trial
court's
chambers.
it
was
viewed
there
in
camera
and
he
has
refused
to
make
it
part
of
the
record
here
in
this
case
although
we
asked
for
an
order
on
it.
so
it
still
remains
secret.
we
don't
know
what's
in
it.
and
it
compounds
the
fact
that
we
would
deny
the
jury.
had
we
had
a
jury
would
be
bad
enough
for
the
trial
court
to
have
such
a
report
anyway
if
you
can
visualize
a
federal
district
court
judge
with
fbi
reports
at
his
chambers
before
he
proceeds
to
a
trial
--
a
case
if
it's
so
much
similar
to
this.
but
where
the
trier
of
the
fact
is
that
person
and
i
think
additional
emphasis
should
be
given
to
(inaudible)
and
that
is
one
of
the
errors
we
complained
about.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir.
the
proceeding
originally
began
in
the
probate
court
of
cook
county
upon
the
presentation
of
a
petition
to
the
court
by
--
as
under
a
prior
will
who
would
have
been
out
under
the
spurious
will.
in
it,
they
alleged
and
it's
in
the
record
incidentally
with
--
and
you
can
refer
to
it
at
the
proper
time.
in
it,
they
alleged
that
they
sought
fraud
was
being
perpetrated
upon
the
court
by
the
presentation
of
this
other
will
and
they
specifically
asked
the
trial
court
for
the
appointment
of
an
amicus
curiae
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
and
prosecuting
if
necessary
the
fraud
involved.
the
trial
court
read
at
that
motion
and
appointed
mr.
fink.
thereafter,
i
think
within
approximately
60
or
90
days,
the
trial
court
entered
an
order
upon
the
amicus
curiae
requiring
him
to
file
his
report
with
the
trial
court
and
such
a
report
was
filed
and
was
held
in
camera
by
the
court.
now
the
record
incidentally
on
that
shows
when
we
made
a
demand
for
it
prior
to
trial
and
then
again
at
trial,
now
the
court,
page
81
of
the
record
said,
“it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
it
belongs
to
the
court
itself
and
the
court
will
turn
it
over
to
you
and
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
read
it
as
concerns
any
witnesses
testimony.
the
court
wants
to
get
at
the
truth
or
falsity
at
the
proceeding
so
i
will
turn
it
over
to
you
and
you
may
use
it
for
cross-examination”.
and
it
was,
portions
of
it
were
turned
over
to
me
somewhat
in
jenks
style,
that
is
where
a
witness
took
the
stand
who
was
referred
to
in
the
fink
report
then
i
was
entitled
to
cross-examine
there
on
the
basis
of
that.
but
that
was
not
the
entire
report.
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
show
it
to
the
court
where
--
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
indicate
to
the
court
whether
or
not
we
are
prejudiced
which
was
the
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
for
denying
us
a
relief
in
that
--
in
connection
with
this
particular
point
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
here
for
us
to
get
such
a
report
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
had
been
prejudiced
since
the
trial
judge
himself
to
which
(inaudible)
significance,
refused
to
give
it
to
us
and
refused
to
put
it
in
the
record.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
we
cannot
tell
mr.
justice
black.
we
cannot
tell.
i
do
not
know
frankly
what
use
was
made
of
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
afterwards,
it
was
filed
by
the
state's
attorney
and
there
were
series
of
them.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
first
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes
sir,
that's
represented
by
mr.
hladis.
the
--
after
this
petition
to
which
i
referred
to
before
have
been
filed
then
and
after
the
fink
report
have
been
filed
then
there
was
a
petition
filed
by
the
state's
attorney
seeking
to
have
the
petitioner
to
show
cause
why
it
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
thereafter,
they
filed
an
amended
petition
after
that
had
been
attacked
and
it
was
upon
the
amended
petition
that
the
trial
ultimately
was
had.
but
in
direct
answer
to
your
honor,
the
petitions
relating
to
contempt
were
filed
after
the
receipt
of
the
so-called
fink
report.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir,
no
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
think
that
it
might
but
not
the
appellate
court
but
if
you
use
it
in
a
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
--
particular
sentence
made
by
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
unless
a
constitutional
question
is
involved.
we
went
directly
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
wrote
a
part
of
my
brief
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
that
point
asking
them
to
at
least
reduce
the
sentence
to
conform
with
this
court's
decision
in
cheff.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
although
i'm
not
sure
that
my
position
is
really
too
sound
because
in
cheff
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
you
do
have
that
section
18,
title
i
defining
petty
crimes
and
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
illinois
at
all.
a
defense
is
either
a
misdemeanor
or
it's
a
felony.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
sir.
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
they
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
the
two-year
sentence
without
considering
the
facet
which
your
honors
is
now
discussing.
they
discussed
it
in
terms
of
cheff
and
they
said
really
that
what
a
sentence
is,
it's
not
at
all
relevant
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
a
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
my
case
depends
upon
if
i
understood
your
honor
correctly,
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
state
courts
in
a
long
line
of
decisions.
i
think
i
counted
23
of
this
court
in
the
last
few
years
as
well
as
an
application
of
recently
written
by
the
court
in
which
you
for
the
first
time
so
far
as
i
know,
reach
out
to
define
what
criminal
proceedings
are
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
constitutional
rights
at
the
bar
association
disciplinary
proceedings.
the
juvenile
proceedings,
the
colorado
sex
offenses
if
you
remember
which
were
regarded
as
civil
there,
i
know
its
three
or
four
others
which
you
--
this
court
now
regards
as
criminal
in
the
sense
that
they
require
the
application
of
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
i
say
of
course
if
in
a
disbarment
proceeding
or
even
a
proceeding
where
a
man
loses
his
license
under
a
municipal
ordinance
which
this
court
has
decided
if
that
is
to
be
considered
criminal
providing
for
the
application
of
constitutional
rights
then
certainly
conduct
which
is
labeled
right
at
the
name
criminal
contempt
and
which
of
itself
constitutes
the
violation
of
the
state
statute
is
felony
should
certainly
be
considered
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
my
answer
is
to
the
affirmative.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i'm
sorry.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
involved.
i
have
struggled
with
it
and
that
has
not
yet
occurred
to
by
mind
a
way
in
which
the
problem
could
be
treated
without
applying
the
constitutional
inhibition
to
the
states
and
the
only
way
i
think
we
could
do
that
would
be
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
would
certainly
accept
that
as
the
alternative.
if
i
understand
your
honor,
i
think
you're
referring
to
an
interpretation
of
the
illinois
constitution
rather
than
the
federal
constitution
would
be,
yes,
i'll
accept
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you
very
much.
