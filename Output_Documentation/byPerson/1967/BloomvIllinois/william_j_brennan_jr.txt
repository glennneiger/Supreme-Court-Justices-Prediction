yes,
yes
is

no,
i'm
not

in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
i
thought
you
said
yesterday
and
as
i
read
his
brief,
it's
an
issue
he
thought
of
malevolent
intent,
is
that
the
language
which
he
says
is
important
and
that
psychiatric
test
to
only
bears
on
it
and
that
he
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
offense
because
the
psychiatric
testimony
might
have
persuaded
the
jury,
indicated
that
he
did
not
have
the
necessary
malevolent
intent
which
--
as
i
understood
your
argument.

mr.
eben,
this
petitioner
has
not
served
any
of
his
sentence
yet,
hasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

does
the
illinois
procedure
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
permit
an
appeal
from
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
appellate
court
might
have
reduced
this
sentence
on
appeal
from
the
sentence
even
though
it
left
the
finding
of
guilt
undisturbed,
might
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
your
appellate
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily
i
take
it
in
illinois
as
--
is
generally
the
case,
there's
no
appeal
from
a
sentence
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
otherwise,
there's
no
appeal
from
the
sentence
to
have
the
sentence
modified
or
reduced
even
though
the
finding
of
guilt
stands
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
new
york.
that's
right.
but
that's
not
true
in
the
criminal
contempt
case
you
could
have
appealed
to
have
this
sentence
reduced
even
though
the
finding
of
guilt
remain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.

contempt
sentence?
