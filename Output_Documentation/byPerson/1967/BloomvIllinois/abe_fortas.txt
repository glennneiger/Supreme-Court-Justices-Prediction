justice
abe
fortas
no
i
think
the
reference
maybe
to
your
adversary's
statement
yesterday
that
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
was
abused
to
show
that
the
petitioner
could
not
possibly
have
committed
this
crime
assuming
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
some
sort
of
a
contest
at
the
trial
level.
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
is
your
point
then,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
not
prejudicial
error,
what
is
it?
what
is
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
confess
that
i
still
don't
follow
you.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
a
contest
on
the
issue
of
guilt
but
not
a
substantial
one,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
situation
in
illinois
with
respect
to
entitlement
to
jury
trial?
is
there
a
dividing
line,
a
misdemeanor
--
what
do
you
call
it
under
your
illinois
system?
justice
abe
fortas
a
--
one
year
or
under?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there,
you're
not
entitled
to
a
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
on
request,
you
can
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
get
one.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
any
misdemeanor?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you
have
here
is
that
as
a
system
--
general
system
of
law
of
judicial
administration
and
the
way
in
illinois
of
which
anybody
who
was
tried
for
a
misdemeanor
meaning
and
offense
in
which
the
maximum
punishment
is
a
year
is
not
automatically
entitled
a
jury
trial
to
make
--
get
it
on
request.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
he
is
tried
for
felony
meaning
where
the
punishment
is
at
the
excess
of
a
year
or
maybe
an
excess
of
a
year
is
entitled
a
jury
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
well
there
is
--
is
a
--
there
may
be
an
alternative
may
there
not
and
that
is,
does
it,
for
this
court
to
consider
whether
a
jury
trial
should
have
been
made
available
in
this
particular
type
of
criminal
contempt
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
does
--
has
adapted
a
jury
trial
system
and
that
that
jury
trial
system
would
embrace
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
if
this
--
if
the
petitioner
here
have
been
prosecuted
for
forgery
under
the
criminal
statute.
now
is
it
possible
that
that
is
an
alternative
theory
to
the
one
about
which
mr.
justice
black
was
questioning
you
namely
that
the
--
your
--
that
the
jury
trial
provision
in
the
sixth
amendment
does
apply
to
the
states
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
