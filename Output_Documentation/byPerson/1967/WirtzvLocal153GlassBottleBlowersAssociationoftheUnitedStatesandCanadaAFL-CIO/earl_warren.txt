mr.
claiborne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
plone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
i
may
sit
down
in
part
of
my
argument
with
your
permission
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
plone,
may
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
quite
understand
this
situation
yet.
were
both
elections
held
under
the
same
rule
as
complained
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
our
judgment
as
to
mootness,
depend
upon,
at
least
upon
--
upon
whether
that
rule
is
reasonable
or
not.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
unreasonable
in
the
first
election
and
in
the
second
election,
the
same
rule
controlled
it,
wouldn't
the
necessity
the
second
election
be
wrong
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
your
argument
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
whenever
the
secretary
starts
to
process
one
of
these
situations
and
decides
to
take
action
that
the
union
can
have
another
election
of
exactly
the
same
kind
and
thus
deprived
the
secretary
of
his
day
in
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
differentiate
that
from
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
the
secretary
once
decides
to
process
one
of
these
elections,
is
it
then
still
a
litigation
between
the
individual
who
made
the
original
complaint
and
the
union
or
is
it
a
matter
of
public
interest
from
that
time
on,
on
which
he
is
protecting
the
public
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
it
you
have
a
union
of
500
members?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
many
under
this
rule
are
eligible
to
run
for
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ten?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
many
offices
to
be
filled?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
there
are
only
ten
men
in
the
union
who
could
--
who
are
eligible
to
run
under
this
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
seem
reasonable
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
else
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
this
election
that
weren't
enough
--
there
weren't
enough
candidates.
they
couldn't
get
enough
candidates
to
fill
the
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
of
the
ten?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
only
ten
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
want
to
run.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
those
--
they
didn't
run.
and
how
did
they
fill
those
jobs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
were
ineligible
to
run?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
selected
the
ineligibles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
all
events,
the
membership
had
no
right
to
consider
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
only
eleven
--
there's
only
eleven
were
eligible
through
the
year,
a
very
small
proportion
would
control
it,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
plone,
may
i
ask
you
this,
in
the
event
that
the
courts
should
find
that
the
case
is
not
moot,
is
this
record
didn't
shape
for
us
to
meet
the
issues
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
not
if
there's
--
you
haven't
thought
at
all.
there's
no
occasion
to
go
ahead
and
file
with
it,
very
well.
mr.
claiborne,
did
you
have
any
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
think
you
had
used
up
your
time
anyway,
haven't
you?
