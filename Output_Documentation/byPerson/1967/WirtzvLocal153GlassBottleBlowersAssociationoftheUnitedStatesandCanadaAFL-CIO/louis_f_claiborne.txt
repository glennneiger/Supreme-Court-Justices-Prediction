mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
number
57,
like
the
next
one
to
be
argued,
arises
under
the
labor
reform
law
of
1959,
more
popularly
known
as
the
landrum-griffin
act.
each
of
these
cases
involves
an
election
of
local
offices
which
allegedly
were
conducted
in
violation
of
the
labor
act
and
accordingly,
must
be
set
aside
and
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
let
me
first
sketch
a
little
bit
the
scheme
of
the
act
in
dealing
with
this
sort
of
violation.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
will
refer
to
them
in
order.
first,
section
401
(e),
which
is
on
page
57
and
58
of
our
brief,
provides
among
other
things
that
in
the
election
of
local
officers,
every
member
in
good
standing
shall
have
a
right
to
be
candidate
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed
and
shall
likewise
have
a
right
to
vote
in
elections
for
local
officers.
the
act
then
provides
that
if
a
member
believes
that
the
section
401
has
been
violated
either
because
eligible
members
were
denied
the
right
to
vote
or
denied
the
right
to
be
candidates
or
on
the
contrary
because
ineligible
members
were
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates,
situation
in
the
next
case,
then
after
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedies,
he
may
complain
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
this
is
provided
for
in
section
402
(a).
and
the
next
subsection
402
(b)
requires
the
secretary
upon
receiving
this
complaint
from
union
member
to
conduct
an
investigation
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
title,
he
is
then
to
file
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
and
to
obtain
an
order
allowing
him
to
rerun
that
election
under
his
supervision
or
in
order
to
have
that
election
rerun
under
his
supervision.
and
finally,
section
402
(c),
which
was
addressed
to
the
district
court
itself,
directs
that
court
to
enter
this
order
if
it
finds
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
401
and
if
it
further
finds
that
that
violation
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
in
that
event,
the
court
is
directed
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
and
to
order
a
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
now,
in
this
case,
number
57,
we
deal
with
local
153
of
the
glass
bottle
blowers
and
its
election
in
october
1963.
at
that
time
and
even
today
and
its
likely
attenuated
for
all,
the
union
had
a
rule
imposed
both
by
the
international
and
by
the
local
constitution
which
provided
that
only
members
who
had
attended
75%,
at
least
75%
of
the
regular
monthly
meetings
of
the
local
while
the
previous
two
years
were
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates
and
that
75%
requirement
is
a
rigid
one
because
no
excuses
for
nonattendance
were
permitted,
not
even
illness,
except
being
at
work
at
the
very
time
of
the
meeting.
the
effect
of
the
rule
as
it
worked
in
1963
has
--
i'll
say
later
as
it
continued
to
work
at
least
two
years
later
--
was
to
disfranchise
and
make
ineligible
as
candidates
the
great
majority
of
the
local
members.
indeed,
out
of
500
members
of
this
particular
local,
only
10
were
eligible
to
be
candidates.
the
result
of
the
--
i
should
add
that
there
are
10
offices
of
the
local
to
be
filled
which
if
there
were
one
eligible
candidate
for
each
office
would
result
in
having
only
one
slate
and
no
contest
whatever.
the
actual
result
in
the
1963
election
was
that
there
was
only
one
candidate
for
two
of
the
offices
and
that
there
were
no
candidates
whatever
for
four
of
the
offices
who
therefore
had
to
be
appointed
from
ineligible
members
at
a
later
date.
this
particular
suit
arises
out
of
the
complaint
of
a
candidate
for
president
who
was
disqualified
under
this
meeting-attendance
rule
because
he
had
attended
one
meeting
too
few
and
he
had
attended
17
meetings
in
the
prior
2
years
out
of
the
24
whereas
if
he
had
attended
18,
he
would
have
been
eligible
to
be
a
candidate.
and
he
missed
one
meeting
at
least
because
he
was
ill
but
that
was
not
an
excused
absence.
now,
after
unsuccessfully
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedies
he
complained
to
the
secretary,
who,
after
investigating,
filed
a
timely
suit
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
agreed
that
the
meeting
attendance
requirement,
with
its
rigid
rule
on
excuses,
was
an
unreasonable
qualification
which
violated
the
act.
now,
although
that
finding
is
not
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reached
the
matter,
there
is
some
suggestion
here
that
the
rule
was
indeed
reasonable
and
not
unreasonable
as
held
by
the
district
court.
we
assume
that
question
is
open
here
on
the
theory
that
the
judgment
below
can
be
sustained
on
any
ground.
however,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
necessary
to
spend
much
time
defending
the
district
judge's
ruling
on
this
particular
point.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
did
disfranchise
98%
of
the
--
did
make
ineligible
as
candidates
98%
of
the
membership.
it's
also
clear
in
this
case
that
we
have
a
candidate,
a
nominee,
who
was
prevented
from
running
on
account
of
this
rule,
by
the
implication
if
this
rule.
it
is
of
course
unknown
whether
had
he
run,
he
would
have
been
elected
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
can
say
that
he
would
not
have
been.
therefore,
the
invocation
of
this
rule
against
him
which
disqualified
him
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
that's
all
the
act
requires.
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
be
a
showing
that
the
invocation
of
the
rule
in
fact
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
or
could
there
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
suggest,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
in
light
of
the
lack
of
dispute
with
respect
to
any
unlocked
facts
and
the
--
what
would
seem
to
us
the
plainly
correct
ruling
of
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
the
unreasonable
disqualification
and
the
plainly
incorrect
ruling
with
respect
to
outcome
that
it
would
be
appropriate
because
as
a
matter
of
indiscretion
of
the
court
to
avoid
a
time
consuming
remand
and
to
decide
those
issues
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
in
fairness
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
the
unreasonableness
of
this
rule
which
left
only
2%
of
the
members
eligible
to
be
candidates,
i
would
say
that
it's
a
rather
clear
question,
if
it's
one
which
the
union
itself
has
changed
recognizing
that
this
didn't
even
give
opportunity
for
any
opponents,
it
certainly
is
not
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
to
provide
for
union
democracy.
elections
are
meaningless
under
a
system
which
results
in
having
only
10
candidates
eligible
for
10
offices.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
was
a
difficult
question
which
required
further
consideration
below.
the
district
court
itself,
of
course,
did
find
disqualification
unreasonable.
the
court
of
appeal
expressed
no
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
that
rule.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
express
no
doubt,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
reasonableness
of
the
ruling,
i
meant
to
say,
of
the
district
judge
on
this
point.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
and
that
makes
no
--
takes
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
–
yes,
your
honor.
but
which
takes
no
account
of
the
--
even
the
most
emergency
reasons
for
non-attendance
except
one
only
which
is
being
a
night
shift
and
(voice
overlap)
had
the
meetings.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
these
meetings
are
once
a
month.
as
i
say,
in
this
case,
our
complainant
attended
17
out
of
24
meetings
in
the
prior
2
years
but
he
missed
one
critical
meeting.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
any
one
is
a
critical
meeting
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
now
it's
on
that
--
thus
say
the
district
court
held
that
the
meeting-attendance
requirement,
as
it
operated,
was
unreasonable
and
violative
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
we
would
argue
that
75%
requirement
is
almost
per
se
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
experience
of
the
meeting-attendance
in
the
--
in
unions
generally.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
of
course
the
--
the
defense
made
of
the
rule,
we
might
point
out
that
if
that
was
its
purpose,
it
utterly
failed
because
two
years
later
at
the
subsequent
election,
there
were
only
13
eligible
candidates.
if
this
rule
for
that
matter
had
been
in
effect
for
some
time
and
still
produce
this
handful
of
eligible
people,
it
seems
to
us
rather
a
rule
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
a
rule
which
applies
to
all
the
locals
in
this
particularly
international
union,
i
think
it's
rather
more
severe
than
most
attendance
requirements.
many
unions
do
have
that
sort
of
requirement
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
really
don't
know,
mr.
justice
brennan
been
dealt
with
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
fact
that
can
be
empirically
determined
by
the
people
in
the
labor
department
without
the
necessary
being
accurate
statistics
on
the
detail.
now,
the
district
court,
although
finding
this
qualification
unreasonable
in
what
seems
to
us
a
surprising
turnabout
then
said,
however,
this
rule
may
not
--
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
this
election
because
our
men
was
free
to
attend
one
more
meeting
which
--
as
to
which
he
has
no
valid
excuse
and
therefore
that
wasn't
the
rule
that
disqualified
him,
it
was
his
own
voluntary
deliberate
act
in
absenting
himself
from
additional
meeting;
that
it
seems
to
us
that
two
can
play
the
game,
we
can
with
equal
force
say
that
it
was
that
aspect
of
the
rule
that
failed
to
give
him
credit
of
the
meeting
he
missed
on
account
of
illness
that
disqualified
him.
if
he
had
been
given
credit
for
the
meeting,
he
would
have
had
18
present
marks
and
therefore
would
be
qualified.
seems
plain
to
us,
therefore,
that
this
rule
did
affect
the
disqualification
of
this
candidate
which
in
turn
are,
as
i've
already
noted,
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
because
he
might
well
have
prevailed.
no
one
knows
but
it
is
efficient
that
that
might
have
been
the
case.
upon
this
finding
that
there
was
no
effect
on
outcome,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
secretary's
suit.
by
this
time,
it
was
august
of
1965
this
particular
union
has
two-year
elections.
we
were
talking
about
the
october
1963
election.
new
election
was
scheduled
for
october
1965,
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
district
court's
decision.
in
view
of
this,
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
to
allow
the
secretary
to
challenge
the
new
election,
a
disposition
which
it
later
regretted
and
in
effect
withdrew.
the
secretary
appealed,
but
by
that
time,
new
elections
had
into
being
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
allow
for
opposed
judgment
application
challenging
the
intervening
election.
however,
on
remand,
the
district
judge
said,
“it's
true
that
i
suggested
that
you
might
challenge
this
new
election.
however,
there's
no
indication
again
that
there's
any
effect
on
outcome
resulting
from
this
rule
which
has
been
applied
again
in
this
new
election
in
1965.
therefore,
i
will
deny
you
relief”.
again,
the
secretary
appealed.
this
time,
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
challenge
to
the
1965
election,
supervening
election,
must
fail
because
there
had
been
no
complaint
from
the
union
member
with
respect
to
it.
therefore,
the
secretary
had
no
--
have
already
filed
suit
challenging
it
and
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
any
order
with
respect
to
it.
as
to
the
challenge
to
the
1963
election,
the
third
circuit
following
the
second
circuit
case
which
you'll
hear
much
about,
the
engineer's
dispute,
said
that
that
is
moot,
that
1963
election
has
been
washed
out
by
the
1965
elections.
there
is
no
relief
which
can
be
afforded
with
respect
to
it.
therefore,
the
case
ought
to
be
dismissed
as
well.
now,
the
principal
issue,
as
the
case
as
presented
here,
is
precisely
that
holding
of
mootness.
the
holding
being
that
the
secretary's
challenge
to
an
election
which
has
been
in
some
sense
superseded
by
an
intervening
election
must
be
viewed
as
abated,
mooted,
as
washed
out
by
the
occurrence
of
that
new
election.
the
rationale
seemingly
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
engineer's
case,
the
third
circuit
here,
or
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
next
case
beyond
it,
is
that
the
only
remedy
provided
by
the
act
when
there
has
been
election
violation
is
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election.
and
then
once
that
election
has
already
been
set
aside
by
the
occurrence
of
a
new
election
in
due
course,
there
is
nothing
further,
no
further
relief,
no
further
remedy
which
the
court
could
usefully
enter.
therefore,
the
case
is
moot.
that
rationale,
of
course,
logically
applies
whether
or
not
the
intervening
election
is
equally
tainted,
be
intervening
that
you
can't
go
back
to
the
election
but
you
can
supersede
it.
it's
equally
superseded
whether
it's
--
the
intervening
election
is
clean
or
tainted.
in
principle
also,
the
holding
of
mootness
would
reach
a
prematurely
held
election
by
the
union.
all
the
union
need
do
under
these
rulings,
to
prevent
the
secretary
from
obtaining
any
relief
is
to
rerun
an
election
which
has
been
challenged.
rerun
it
without
supervision.
rerun
it
with
or
without
eliminating
the
irregularity
which
provoked
or
challenged
previous
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
us,
mr.
justice
white,
and
this
is
the
heart
of
our
argument
that
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
very
deliberately
not
to
end
with
rerunning
the
tainted
election
but
to
rerun
it
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
laboratory
election
is
viewed
as
an
essential
and
perhaps
the
most
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
a
certain
time.
now
union
is
free
during
the
period
when
it
is
given
three
months
in
which
to
correct
its
own
--
to
clean
its
own
house.
the
practical
matter
it
has
fall
longer
than
that.
there
is
then
further
months
during
which
the
unsuccessful
protest,
the
complaint
of
the
secretary,
there
is
no
time,
of
course,
for
the
union
to
rerun
its
own
election
without
supervision.
then
there
were
60
days
during
which
the
secretary
investigates,
if
during
that
period,
a
new
election
is
run,
so
as
to
cleanse
the
effects
of
the
old
one,
no
supervision
is
necessary
and
the
union
will
successfully
moot
any
court
challenge,
any
intrusion
by
the
secretary
of
labor
which
this
so
much
complained
about.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white.
now
it
seems
to
us,
as
i
said
in
effect
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
that
the
heart
of
the
matter
is,
the
crux
of
the
matter,
is
that
the
act
provides
wisely
or
unwisely
for
a
laboratory
election
as
the
effective
remedy
in
the
event
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
statute.
most
of
the
argument
here
from
the
outside
is
directed
against
the
disruption
of
union
affairs,
the
intrusion
of
the
secretary
of
the
government
into
internal
union
matters.
it's
really
an
argument
directed
against
a
laboratory
election
at
anytime.
a
laboratory
election
is
no
more,
no
less
intrusive
or
disruptive
because
it
comes
later
rather
than
sooner.
all
of
these
arguments
about
the
opportunity
of
the
union
ought
to
have
and
was
given
deliberately
to
clean
its
own
house,
apply
with
equal
force
to
any
laboratory
election
where
they
held
before
the
next
regular
election
occurs
or
not.
in
effect,
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
course,
we
concede
that
that
can
be
done
if
it's
done
within
time.
their
further
point
seems
to
be
a
denial
of
the
need
for
a
laboratory
election
if
the
union
came
through,
and
that
is
not
the
law
if
the
supervised
election
can
occur
before
it's
overtaken.
the
need
for
a
laboratory
election
is
not
mooted
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
claim
that
it
would
be
if
the
supervised
election
is
directed
by
the
district
court
within
the
--
the
still
continuing
term
of
the
--
those
who
were
elected.
they
cannot
avoid
that
laboratory
election
by
simply
voluntarily
rerunning
it
free
of
the
offensive
qualification
or
rather
irregularity
after
suit
has
been
instituted.
for
whatever
reasons,
then
we
think
those
reasons
are
important
and
quite
obvious,
the
congress
thought
the
laboratory
election
a
necessary
part
of
the
remedy
and
it
is
a
part
of
the
remedies
that
remains
available
even
though
there
is
no
tainted
election
to
be
set
aside.
now,
the
textual
argument
that's
made
against
us
is
that
this
laboratory
election
is
in
the
wording
of
the
act,
a
mere
adjunct
of
an
order
which
would
void
the
invalid
election.
i'd
first
point
out
that
laboratory
election
is
a
remedy
available
where
there
is
no
setting
aside
of
an
election,
which
was
most
obviously
in
the
case
where
the
order
is
to
hold
an
election
which
should
have
been
held
that
has
not
there.
that
election
must
be
held
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary,
indicating
that
this
laboratory
election
is
not
an
adjunct
with
anything.
it's
the
principal
remedy
for
any
violation
of
section
401.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
comes
out
of
the
labor
board's,
appellants
which
invented
this
devise
of
laboratory
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
well,
again
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
congress
apparently,
deliberately
denied
the
secretary
and
the
courts
power
to
issue
declaratory
judgments
of
permanent
injunctions
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
applying
one
of
these
offensive
rules.
and
on
that
point,
of
course,
all
counsel
here
agreed.
that
would
seem
to
be
an
alternative.
it
seems,
however,
not
to
be
available
but
it's
been
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
holding
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
title
i?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
here,
of
course,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
the
case
is
under
title
i.
and,
of
course,
the
holding
in
calhoon
versus
harvey
was
very
clearly
that
under
title
iv
the
suit
must
be
through
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
secretary.
and
the
secretary
does
not
merely
act
as
the
lawyer
for
the
union
member.
he,
once
seized
of
the
claim,
represents
the
public
interest,
the
interest
of
the
union
members
in
having
some
democracy
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
much
more
broadly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
with
some
important
differences,
notably
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
that
of
which
i
ought
to
give
you
to
discuss
perhaps
a
great
length
in
the
next
case.
let
me
conclude
only
by
saying
that
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
title
iv
is
a
prerequisite
to
an
order
directing
a
supervised
election,
a
laboratory
election.
but
the
availability
of
an
order
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
the
direction
of
a
laboratory
election.
if
the
union's
intervening
election
has
already
wiped
out
the
invalid
election,
then
it
is
of
course,
needless
for
the
court
to
enter
an
order
to
that
effect.
but
it
does
not
defeat
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
ask
or
the
duty
of
the
court
to
require
a
new
election
on
the
laboratory
conditions,
the
important
remedy
which
the
act
quite
deliberately
provided
for.
the
notion
that
the
secretary
has
invented
this
horrible
weapon
is
because
wholly
mistaken,
it
is
the
congress
which
very
deliberately
included
it
as
the
remedy
under
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
somewhat
attenuated
form.
the
excuses
have
been
somewhat
liberalized,
also
were
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true,
and
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
i
must
caution
that
we
do
and
take
the
position
that
even
though
the
particular
irregularity
complained
of
originally
has
been
removed
by
amendment
of
the
union
constitution
by
some
other
means,
in
the
intervening
election,
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
insist
on
a
laboratory
election
is
even
then
not
mooted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
this
particular
case,
the
supervening
election
was
tainted
for
the
same
reason
that
the
originally
challenged
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
election
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
same
rule
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
was
in
full
force.
at
that
time,
that
is
conceded.
it
was
so
found
by
the
district
court
on
remand.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
number
57,
like
the
next
one
to
be
argued,
arises
under
the
labor
reform
law
of
1959,
more
popularly
known
as
the
landrum-griffin
act.
each
of
these
cases
involves
an
election
of
local
offices
which
allegedly
were
conducted
in
violation
of
the
labor
act
and
accordingly,
must
be
set
aside
and
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
let
me
first
sketch
a
little
bit
the
scheme
of
the
act
in
dealing
with
this
sort
of
violation.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
will
refer
to
them
in
order.
first,
section
401
(e),
which
is
on
page
57
and
58
of
our
brief,
provides
among
other
things
that
in
the
election
of
local
officers,
every
member
in
good
standing
shall
have
a
right
to
be
candidate
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed
and
shall
likewise
have
a
right
to
vote
in
elections
for
local
officers.
the
act
then
provides
that
if
a
member
believes
that
the
section
401
has
been
violated
either
because
eligible
members
were
denied
the
right
to
vote
or
denied
the
right
to
be
candidates
or
on
the
contrary
because
ineligible
members
were
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates,
situation
in
the
next
case,
then
after
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedies,
he
may
complain
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
this
is
provided
for
in
section
402
(a).
and
the
next
subsection
402
(b)
requires
the
secretary
upon
receiving
this
complaint
from
union
member
to
conduct
an
investigation
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
title,
he
is
then
to
file
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
and
to
obtain
an
order
allowing
him
to
rerun
that
election
under
his
supervision
or
in
order
to
have
that
election
rerun
under
his
supervision.
and
finally,
section
402
(c),
which
was
addressed
to
the
district
court
itself,
directs
that
court
to
enter
this
order
if
it
finds
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
401
and
if
it
further
finds
that
that
violation
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
in
that
event,
the
court
is
directed
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
and
to
order
a
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
now,
in
this
case,
number
57,
we
deal
with
local
153
of
the
glass
bottle
blowers
and
its
election
in
october
1963.
at
that
time
and
even
today
and
its
likely
attenuated
for
all,
the
union
had
a
rule
imposed
both
by
the
international
and
by
the
local
constitution
which
provided
that
only
members
who
had
attended
75%,
at
least
75%
of
the
regular
monthly
meetings
of
the
local
while
the
previous
two
years
were
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates
and
that
75%
requirement
is
a
rigid
one
because
no
excuses
for
nonattendance
were
permitted,
not
even
illness,
except
being
at
work
at
the
very
time
of
the
meeting.
the
effect
of
the
rule
as
it
worked
in
1963
has
--
i'll
say
later
as
it
continued
to
work
at
least
two
years
later
--
was
to
disfranchise
and
make
ineligible
as
candidates
the
great
majority
of
the
local
members.
indeed,
out
of
500
members
of
this
particular
local,
only
10
were
eligible
to
be
candidates.
the
result
of
the
--
i
should
add
that
there
are
10
offices
of
the
local
to
be
filled
which
if
there
were
one
eligible
candidate
for
each
office
would
result
in
having
only
one
slate
and
no
contest
whatever.
the
actual
result
in
the
1963
election
was
that
there
was
only
one
candidate
for
two
of
the
offices
and
that
there
were
no
candidates
whatever
for
four
of
the
offices
who
therefore
had
to
be
appointed
from
ineligible
members
at
a
later
date.
this
particular
suit
arises
out
of
the
complaint
of
a
candidate
for
president
who
was
disqualified
under
this
meeting-attendance
rule
because
he
had
attended
one
meeting
too
few
and
he
had
attended
17
meetings
in
the
prior
2
years
out
of
the
24
whereas
if
he
had
attended
18,
he
would
have
been
eligible
to
be
a
candidate.
and
he
missed
one
meeting
at
least
because
he
was
ill
but
that
was
not
an
excused
absence.
now,
after
unsuccessfully
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedies
he
complained
to
the
secretary,
who,
after
investigating,
filed
a
timely
suit
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
agreed
that
the
meeting
attendance
requirement,
with
its
rigid
rule
on
excuses,
was
an
unreasonable
qualification
which
violated
the
act.
now,
although
that
finding
is
not
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reached
the
matter,
there
is
some
suggestion
here
that
the
rule
was
indeed
reasonable
and
not
unreasonable
as
held
by
the
district
court.
we
assume
that
question
is
open
here
on
the
theory
that
the
judgment
below
can
be
sustained
on
any
ground.
however,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
necessary
to
spend
much
time
defending
the
district
judge's
ruling
on
this
particular
point.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
did
disfranchise
98%
of
the
--
did
make
ineligible
as
candidates
98%
of
the
membership.
it's
also
clear
in
this
case
that
we
have
a
candidate,
a
nominee,
who
was
prevented
from
running
on
account
of
this
rule,
by
the
implication
if
this
rule.
it
is
of
course
unknown
whether
had
he
run,
he
would
have
been
elected
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
can
say
that
he
would
not
have
been.
therefore,
the
invocation
of
this
rule
against
him
which
disqualified
him
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
that's
all
the
act
requires.
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
be
a
showing
that
the
invocation
of
the
rule
in
fact
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
or
could
there
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
suggest,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
in
light
of
the
lack
of
dispute
with
respect
to
any
unlocked
facts
and
the
--
what
would
seem
to
us
the
plainly
correct
ruling
of
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
the
unreasonable
disqualification
and
the
plainly
incorrect
ruling
with
respect
to
outcome
that
it
would
be
appropriate
because
as
a
matter
of
indiscretion
of
the
court
to
avoid
a
time
consuming
remand
and
to
decide
those
issues
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
in
fairness
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
the
unreasonableness
of
this
rule
which
left
only
2%
of
the
members
eligible
to
be
candidates,
i
would
say
that
it's
a
rather
clear
question,
if
it's
one
which
the
union
itself
has
changed
recognizing
that
this
didn't
even
give
opportunity
for
any
opponents,
it
certainly
is
not
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
to
provide
for
union
democracy.
elections
are
meaningless
under
a
system
which
results
in
having
only
10
candidates
eligible
for
10
offices.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
was
a
difficult
question
which
required
further
consideration
below.
the
district
court
itself,
of
course,
did
find
disqualification
unreasonable.
the
court
of
appeal
expressed
no
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
that
rule.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
express
no
doubt,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
reasonableness
of
the
ruling,
i
meant
to
say,
of
the
district
judge
on
this
point.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
and
that
makes
no
--
takes
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
–
yes,
your
honor.
but
which
takes
no
account
of
the
--
even
the
most
emergency
reasons
for
non-attendance
except
one
only
which
is
being
a
night
shift
and
(voice
overlap)
had
the
meetings.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
these
meetings
are
once
a
month.
as
i
say,
in
this
case,
our
complainant
attended
17
out
of
24
meetings
in
the
prior
2
years
but
he
missed
one
critical
meeting.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
any
one
is
a
critical
meeting
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
now
it's
on
that
--
thus
say
the
district
court
held
that
the
meeting-attendance
requirement,
as
it
operated,
was
unreasonable
and
violative
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
we
would
argue
that
75%
requirement
is
almost
per
se
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
experience
of
the
meeting-attendance
in
the
--
in
unions
generally.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
of
course
the
--
the
defense
made
of
the
rule,
we
might
point
out
that
if
that
was
its
purpose,
it
utterly
failed
because
two
years
later
at
the
subsequent
election,
there
were
only
13
eligible
candidates.
if
this
rule
for
that
matter
had
been
in
effect
for
some
time
and
still
produce
this
handful
of
eligible
people,
it
seems
to
us
rather
a
rule
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
a
rule
which
applies
to
all
the
locals
in
this
particularly
international
union,
i
think
it's
rather
more
severe
than
most
attendance
requirements.
many
unions
do
have
that
sort
of
requirement
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
really
don't
know,
mr.
justice
brennan
been
dealt
with
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
fact
that
can
be
empirically
determined
by
the
people
in
the
labor
department
without
the
necessary
being
accurate
statistics
on
the
detail.
now,
the
district
court,
although
finding
this
qualification
unreasonable
in
what
seems
to
us
a
surprising
turnabout
then
said,
however,
this
rule
may
not
--
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
this
election
because
our
men
was
free
to
attend
one
more
meeting
which
--
as
to
which
he
has
no
valid
excuse
and
therefore
that
wasn't
the
rule
that
disqualified
him,
it
was
his
own
voluntary
deliberate
act
in
absenting
himself
from
additional
meeting;
that
it
seems
to
us
that
two
can
play
the
game,
we
can
with
equal
force
say
that
it
was
that
aspect
of
the
rule
that
failed
to
give
him
credit
of
the
meeting
he
missed
on
account
of
illness
that
disqualified
him.
if
he
had
been
given
credit
for
the
meeting,
he
would
have
had
18
present
marks
and
therefore
would
be
qualified.
seems
plain
to
us,
therefore,
that
this
rule
did
affect
the
disqualification
of
this
candidate
which
in
turn
are,
as
i've
already
noted,
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
because
he
might
well
have
prevailed.
no
one
knows
but
it
is
efficient
that
that
might
have
been
the
case.
upon
this
finding
that
there
was
no
effect
on
outcome,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
secretary's
suit.
by
this
time,
it
was
august
of
1965
this
particular
union
has
two-year
elections.
we
were
talking
about
the
october
1963
election.
new
election
was
scheduled
for
october
1965,
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
district
court's
decision.
in
view
of
this,
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
to
allow
the
secretary
to
challenge
the
new
election,
a
disposition
which
it
later
regretted
and
in
effect
withdrew.
the
secretary
appealed,
but
by
that
time,
new
elections
had
into
being
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
allow
for
opposed
judgment
application
challenging
the
intervening
election.
however,
on
remand,
the
district
judge
said,
“it's
true
that
i
suggested
that
you
might
challenge
this
new
election.
however,
there's
no
indication
again
that
there's
any
effect
on
outcome
resulting
from
this
rule
which
has
been
applied
again
in
this
new
election
in
1965.
therefore,
i
will
deny
you
relief”.
again,
the
secretary
appealed.
this
time,
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
challenge
to
the
1965
election,
supervening
election,
must
fail
because
there
had
been
no
complaint
from
the
union
member
with
respect
to
it.
therefore,
the
secretary
had
no
--
have
already
filed
suit
challenging
it
and
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
any
order
with
respect
to
it.
as
to
the
challenge
to
the
1963
election,
the
third
circuit
following
the
second
circuit
case
which
you'll
hear
much
about,
the
engineer's
dispute,
said
that
that
is
moot,
that
1963
election
has
been
washed
out
by
the
1965
elections.
there
is
no
relief
which
can
be
afforded
with
respect
to
it.
therefore,
the
case
ought
to
be
dismissed
as
well.
now,
the
principal
issue,
as
the
case
as
presented
here,
is
precisely
that
holding
of
mootness.
the
holding
being
that
the
secretary's
challenge
to
an
election
which
has
been
in
some
sense
superseded
by
an
intervening
election
must
be
viewed
as
abated,
mooted,
as
washed
out
by
the
occurrence
of
that
new
election.
the
rationale
seemingly
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
engineer's
case,
the
third
circuit
here,
or
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
next
case
beyond
it,
is
that
the
only
remedy
provided
by
the
act
when
there
has
been
election
violation
is
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election.
and
then
once
that
election
has
already
been
set
aside
by
the
occurrence
of
a
new
election
in
due
course,
there
is
nothing
further,
no
further
relief,
no
further
remedy
which
the
court
could
usefully
enter.
therefore,
the
case
is
moot.
that
rationale,
of
course,
logically
applies
whether
or
not
the
intervening
election
is
equally
tainted,
be
intervening
that
you
can't
go
back
to
the
election
but
you
can
supersede
it.
it's
equally
superseded
whether
it's
--
the
intervening
election
is
clean
or
tainted.
in
principle
also,
the
holding
of
mootness
would
reach
a
prematurely
held
election
by
the
union.
all
the
union
need
do
under
these
rulings,
to
prevent
the
secretary
from
obtaining
any
relief
is
to
rerun
an
election
which
has
been
challenged.
rerun
it
without
supervision.
rerun
it
with
or
without
eliminating
the
irregularity
which
provoked
or
challenged
previous
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
us,
mr.
justice
white,
and
this
is
the
heart
of
our
argument
that
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
very
deliberately
not
to
end
with
rerunning
the
tainted
election
but
to
rerun
it
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
laboratory
election
is
viewed
as
an
essential
and
perhaps
the
most
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
a
certain
time.
now
union
is
free
during
the
period
when
it
is
given
three
months
in
which
to
correct
its
own
--
to
clean
its
own
house.
the
practical
matter
it
has
fall
longer
than
that.
there
is
then
further
months
during
which
the
unsuccessful
protest,
the
complaint
of
the
secretary,
there
is
no
time,
of
course,
for
the
union
to
rerun
its
own
election
without
supervision.
then
there
were
60
days
during
which
the
secretary
investigates,
if
during
that
period,
a
new
election
is
run,
so
as
to
cleanse
the
effects
of
the
old
one,
no
supervision
is
necessary
and
the
union
will
successfully
moot
any
court
challenge,
any
intrusion
by
the
secretary
of
labor
which
this
so
much
complained
about.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white.
now
it
seems
to
us,
as
i
said
in
effect
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
that
the
heart
of
the
matter
is,
the
crux
of
the
matter,
is
that
the
act
provides
wisely
or
unwisely
for
a
laboratory
election
as
the
effective
remedy
in
the
event
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
statute.
most
of
the
argument
here
from
the
outside
is
directed
against
the
disruption
of
union
affairs,
the
intrusion
of
the
secretary
of
the
government
into
internal
union
matters.
it's
really
an
argument
directed
against
a
laboratory
election
at
anytime.
a
laboratory
election
is
no
more,
no
less
intrusive
or
disruptive
because
it
comes
later
rather
than
sooner.
all
of
these
arguments
about
the
opportunity
of
the
union
ought
to
have
and
was
given
deliberately
to
clean
its
own
house,
apply
with
equal
force
to
any
laboratory
election
where
they
held
before
the
next
regular
election
occurs
or
not.
in
effect,
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
course,
we
concede
that
that
can
be
done
if
it's
done
within
time.
their
further
point
seems
to
be
a
denial
of
the
need
for
a
laboratory
election
if
the
union
came
through,
and
that
is
not
the
law
if
the
supervised
election
can
occur
before
it's
overtaken.
the
need
for
a
laboratory
election
is
not
mooted
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
claim
that
it
would
be
if
the
supervised
election
is
directed
by
the
district
court
within
the
--
the
still
continuing
term
of
the
--
those
who
were
elected.
they
cannot
avoid
that
laboratory
election
by
simply
voluntarily
rerunning
it
free
of
the
offensive
qualification
or
rather
irregularity
after
suit
has
been
instituted.
for
whatever
reasons,
then
we
think
those
reasons
are
important
and
quite
obvious,
the
congress
thought
the
laboratory
election
a
necessary
part
of
the
remedy
and
it
is
a
part
of
the
remedies
that
remains
available
even
though
there
is
no
tainted
election
to
be
set
aside.
now,
the
textual
argument
that's
made
against
us
is
that
this
laboratory
election
is
in
the
wording
of
the
act,
a
mere
adjunct
of
an
order
which
would
void
the
invalid
election.
i'd
first
point
out
that
laboratory
election
is
a
remedy
available
where
there
is
no
setting
aside
of
an
election,
which
was
most
obviously
in
the
case
where
the
order
is
to
hold
an
election
which
should
have
been
held
that
has
not
there.
that
election
must
be
held
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary,
indicating
that
this
laboratory
election
is
not
an
adjunct
with
anything.
it's
the
principal
remedy
for
any
violation
of
section
401.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
comes
out
of
the
labor
board's,
appellants
which
invented
this
devise
of
laboratory
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
well,
again
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
congress
apparently,
deliberately
denied
the
secretary
and
the
courts
power
to
issue
declaratory
judgments
of
permanent
injunctions
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
applying
one
of
these
offensive
rules.
and
on
that
point,
of
course,
all
counsel
here
agreed.
that
would
seem
to
be
an
alternative.
it
seems,
however,
not
to
be
available
but
it's
been
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
holding
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
title
i?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
here,
of
course,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
the
case
is
under
title
i.
and,
of
course,
the
holding
in
calhoon
versus
harvey
was
very
clearly
that
under
title
iv
the
suit
must
be
through
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
secretary.
and
the
secretary
does
not
merely
act
as
the
lawyer
for
the
union
member.
he,
once
seized
of
the
claim,
represents
the
public
interest,
the
interest
of
the
union
members
in
having
some
democracy
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
much
more
broadly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
with
some
important
differences,
notably
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
that
of
which
i
ought
to
give
you
to
discuss
perhaps
a
great
length
in
the
next
case.
let
me
conclude
only
by
saying
that
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
title
iv
is
a
prerequisite
to
an
order
directing
a
supervised
election,
a
laboratory
election.
but
the
availability
of
an
order
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
the
direction
of
a
laboratory
election.
if
the
union's
intervening
election
has
already
wiped
out
the
invalid
election,
then
it
is
of
course,
needless
for
the
court
to
enter
an
order
to
that
effect.
but
it
does
not
defeat
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
ask
or
the
duty
of
the
court
to
require
a
new
election
on
the
laboratory
conditions,
the
important
remedy
which
the
act
quite
deliberately
provided
for.
the
notion
that
the
secretary
has
invented
this
horrible
weapon
is
because
wholly
mistaken,
it
is
the
congress
which
very
deliberately
included
it
as
the
remedy
under
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
somewhat
attenuated
form.
the
excuses
have
been
somewhat
liberalized,
also
were
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true,
and
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
i
must
caution
that
we
do
and
take
the
position
that
even
though
the
particular
irregularity
complained
of
originally
has
been
removed
by
amendment
of
the
union
constitution
by
some
other
means,
in
the
intervening
election,
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
insist
on
a
laboratory
election
is
even
then
not
mooted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
this
particular
case,
the
supervening
election
was
tainted
for
the
same
reason
that
the
originally
challenged
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
election
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
same
rule
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
was
in
full
force.
at
that
time,
that
is
conceded.
it
was
so
found
by
the
district
court
on
remand.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
