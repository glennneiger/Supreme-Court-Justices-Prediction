mr.
albert
k.
plone
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
with
the
permission
of
the
court
mr.
albert
k.
plone
--
chief
justice.
these
two
cases,
numbers
57
and
58
are
the
first
cases
before
the
court
dealing
with
title
iv
of
the
act.
they
raised
three
issues.
does
a
second
regularly
scheduled
election
held
vague
and
moot
a
suit
by
the
secretary
to
set
aside
a
prior
election.
and
does
the
meaning
of
the
requirements
contained
in
section
402
(c)
of
the
act
that
in
order
to
set
aside
an
election,
the
secretary
must
prove
that
the
alleged
violation
may
have
had
an
effect
to
the
outcome
of
the
election.
and
third,
whether
the
secretary
has
cart
launch
to
raise
issues
all
of
those
that
the
union
members
has
raised.
as
to
the
last,
that
is
not
in
our
case.
it
will
be
in
the
next
following
case.
our
position
is
that
as
to
all
these
three
issues,
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
expand
the
very
limited
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
congress.
at
the
start,
it
is
well
connoted
that
these
contested
issues
are
merely
the
visible
portion
of
the
iceberg
with
beneath
of
which
lies
the
great
statutory
inhibitions
that
affect
the
operation
of
unions
as
placed
upon
them
under
the
1959
statute.
it
is
clear
that
congress
gave
the
secretary
authority
to
act
in
this
instance
as
the
union
members'
lawyer
as
stated
by
the
senators
and
the
late
senator
kennedy
in
that
regard,
and
i
will
refer
to
it
later,
the
original
draft
of
the
bill
that
was
introduced,
that
account
was
specifically
made
and
remains
throughout
the
text
of
the
legislative
history.
in
this
role,
the
secretary
has
the
authority
under
section
402
of
the
act
to
seek
an
election
challenged
by
a
union
member,
who
has
exhausted
his
internal
remedies,
set
aside
on
the
ground
raised
by
the
member
if
he
can
prove
that
the
election
was
invalid
and
the
invalidity
may
have
affected
the
outcome.
moreover,
he
has
a
broad
authority
under
section
601
continuously
to
investigate
union
elections
or
any
other
union
affairs
and
report
his
findings
to
the
membership.
this
basic
authority,
while
it
is
circumscribed
worth
a
revolution
in
the
amount
of
allowable
governmental
intervention
into
intenal
union
affairs.
thus,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
the
respondents
prevail
in
this
court,
the
government's
supervisory
increase
in
the
powers
over
union,
elections
will
still
be
quite
considerable.
the
real
question
presented
is
whether
the
supervising
power
will
be
limited
as
congress
intended
or
unlimited
as
the
secretary
wishes
it
to
be.
both
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
limited
and
very
limited
power
in
that
area.
the
drafters
and
supporters
of
title
iv
recognized
that
the
public
interest
in
union
democracy
required
a
balancing
between
preservation
of
the
union
autonomy
and
membership
control
of
their
organization.
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
government
in
support
on
the
other,
as
the
majority
report
of
the
senate
labor
committee
stated,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
page
21
of
the
amicus
brief,
“given
the
maintenance
of
minimum
democratic
safeguards
and
detailed
essential
information
about
the
union,
the
individual
members
are
fully
competent
to
regulate
union
affairs”.
the
committee
strongly
opposes
any
attempt
to
prescribe
detailed
procedural
--
procedures
and
standards
for
the
conduct
of
union
business.
such
paternalistic
regulation
would
weaken
rather
than
strengthen
the
labor
movement.
it
would
crossover
into
the
area
of
trading
and
licensing
and
destroyed
union
independence.
as
we
proceed
through
the
facts
in
this
case,
gentlemen
of
the
court,
we
find
that
there
is
a
remarkable
absence
of
predicate
where
the
secretary
is
concerned
about
the
affairs
of
this
and
other
trade
unions.
may
i
first
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that,
in
response
to
the
question
by
justice
fortas,
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
and
almost
immediate
strong
effort
made
to
correct
or
let's
say
modify
the
rule
as
indicated
by
the
trial
judge
in
his
decision.
the
facts
briefly
are
in
that
area;
that
judge
dumbauld
rendered
his
decision
on
august
26th,
1965
with
the
local
union's
election
being
scheduled
for
early
october
2nd,
tuesday
i
believe
or
thursday
in
october,
that
the
local
union
had
already,
under
its
constitutional
requirements
set
forth
in
so-called
constitutional
bylaws
had
one
nomination
meeting
early
in
august,
and
the
second
nomination
meeting
in
september,
and
eligibility
had
already
been
determined
under
the
then
validly
existing
rule
because
the
statute
states
specifically
that
the
union's
election
in
its
procedures
are
considered
valid
unless
changed
and
until
changed
by
a
court
decree.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
if
your
--
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
i
can't
say
concretely
for
this
reason,
sir,
that
even
in
the
first
case,
this
gentleman
who
complained
of
not
have
being
--
are
being
held
eligible,
had
been
given
credit
for
one
meeting
that
he
did
not
attend
because
of
his
wife's
illness,
so
i
can't
honestly
say
that
the
rule
was
being
conducted
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
the
rule
was
the
same,
sir,
insofar
as
we
know
but
was
in
the
process
of
being
changed.
that's
all
i
could
say
as
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
my
deep
concern
is
a
matter
of
the
cause
my
intimate
relationship
with
them,
and
i
watched
this
matter
for
progressed
and
perhaps
would
like
to
proceed
in
that
specific
fashion
if
you
will
forgive
me.
we
were
deeply
concerned
and
i
speak
i
am
sure
for
all
labor
when
the
secretary
advances
the
position
that
absent
a
complaint
by
a
member,
and
that's
what
the
third
circuit
court
indicated
or
stated,
that
the
secretary
has
a
right
to
walk
into
a
local
union
and
conduct
another
election.
now,
there's
a
very
interesting
factual
background
here
that
i
say,
this
is
my
personal
knowledge,
that
the
secretary
should
know,
that
there
were
some
30
odd
members
of
the
local
union
in
the
courtroom
when
this
case
was
being
tried
at
the
request
of
the
secretary.
the
only
witness
that
the
secretary
brought
forth
was
the
complainant
himself
and
the
secretary
sought
to
it
that
the
decision
of
judge
dumbauld
was
spread
over
the
newspapers
in
that
small
community
of
washington,
pennsylvania
because
i
saw
these
copies
myself,
as
well
as
in
the
pittsburgh
papers.
and
the
entire
community,
which
is
composed
substantially
of
glass
workers
was
well
aware
what
was
going
on
as
early
as
august
1965,
we
have
the
judge
dumbauld
decision
and
i
say
this
with
true
humbleness,
based
upon
experience,
that
in
my
opinion,
the
membership
was
satisfied
with
that
rule.
i
say
that
most
meaningfully
because
no
--
not
only
because
no
complaint
came
forth
but
in
another
case,
it
is
--
this
rule
has
been
used
by
members
to
deliberately
avoid
candidacy
because
he
didn't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
turning
down
candidacy.
however,
that's
on
the
side.
let
me
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
member
who
came
forth
to
complain
about
this
rule.
i
--
the
secretary
attempts
to
meet
our
argument
by
stating
that
once
an
allegedly
unlawful
election
takes
place,
he
must
have
the
authority
to
ave
a
rerun
election,
to
remove
the
taint
of
the
prior
election.
in
other
words,
he
suggests
that
he
has
broad
regulatory
powers
that
would
entitle
him
to
set
aside
a
presumptively
valid
election,
even
if
he
can't
meet
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
statute
requires.
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlined,
we
believe
that
the
secretary's
argument
indicates
that
he
is
seeking
to
push
to
one
side,
the
delicate
balance
congress
struck
in
order
to
broaden
his
powers.
and
as
has
been
stated
in
other
decisions,
vying
to
this
very
important
constitutional
question,
the
lesson
of
his
pre-teaches
that
the
enlargement
of
a
particular
power,
however,
in
that
one
all
too
frequently
that
leads
to
abuse
and
disastrous
consequences.
and
i
say
most
meaningfully,
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
the
very
purpose
that
this
act
intended
was
being
fully
met.
in
1963,
the
election
in
question
was
held.
in
due
course,
the
matter
was
reached
the
stage
of
litigation
and
disposition.
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
hearing
in
this
case,
meetings
were
held
with
the
secretary
of
labor
as
subsequent
to
the
decision,
meetings
continued
to
be
held
and
as
stated
in
the
record
on
page
--
page
58,
“in
june
1966,
after
meetings
were
held
with
the
secretary
personally
by
the
president
minton
of
international
union,
not
a
slight
variation
of
this
rule
was
dealt
with
but
spelt
out
before
you
a
very
substantial
number
of
excuse
areas
wherein
instilled
in
this
rule
to
a
point
where
it
gives
every
member
an
opportunity
used
for
almost
any
reasonable
occurrence
that
might
take
away
from
the
union
meeting.
now,
before
i
proceed
further,
let
me
again
point
out,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
when
the
government
--
when
the
secretary
started
to
process
this
matter,
there
were
two
important
questions
that
were
to
be
resolved,
one
was,
by
stipulation
modeled
by
judge
dumbauld
himself.
by
stipulation,
the
secretary
agreed
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
laudable.
it
was
a
desirable
rule
that
had
for
its
purpose,
not
only
membership
attendance
but
equal
as
important
or
more
important
a
background
of
knowledge
on
how
a
local
union
functions
by
anyone
of
the
sought
candidacy,
that
where
a
raw
recruit
come
in
without
that
background
would
be
and
has
proven
to
be
disastrous.
that
is
by
agreement
with
the
government
that
such
was
the
purpose
of
the
rule
that
was
passed
in
1957.
and
secondly,
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
wyner,
counsel
for
the
secretary
and
judge
dumbauld
at
the
pre-trial
conference
which
is
part
of
the
record,
he
stated
specifically
that
there
was
no
venality
connected
with
this
whole
proceeding.
there
was
no
charge
of
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
unions'
officers,
but
only
that
there
was
a
rule
which
the
secretary
considered
unreasonable
because
of
the
numbers
game
that
was
being
played.
may
i
further
say
that
there
are
at
least
15
or
16
or
may
be
17
international
unions
based
upon
the
secretary's
own
statistics
that
have
membership
requirement
attendance
such
as
ours.
there
are
only
--
there
were
only
two
at
that
time.
it
was
75%
but
again,
there
was
50%
attendance
and
so
forth,
majority
were
50%.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
50%
or
75%
or
attendance
requirements
as
to
numbers
of
meeting
that
was
at
stake.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
would
say
essentially,
yes,
sir
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
no,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
say
it
very
specifically..
the
first
election
was
held
under
secreteray
(inaudible).
the
second
election,
it
is
the
basic
predicate
of
the
act
as
we
see
the
act
that
each
election
as
an
independent
function
of
the
union
has
to
be
separately
considered
by
the
secretary,
that
the
second
election
must
be
preceded
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
by
an
individual
member
who
complains
of
that
election.
absent
to
that
complaint,
that
election
is
presumed
by
the
statutory
language
to
be
valid
that
the
“taint”
that
is
talked
about
here
does
not
carry
over
to
the
secretary's
right
to
proceed
in
the
area
of
litigation
or
a
holding
of
government
election,
that
he
is
bound
by
the
specific
language
of
402
(a)
through
(c)
all
interdependent.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
the
reason
--
that
that's
--
the
reason
is
other
than
mootness
in
that
one
respect
that
each
election
stands
on
its
own
two
feet.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
a
question
--
pardon
me.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
don't
intend
that
comment
to
bring
at
all
but
i'd
like
to
explain
my
answer,
if
i
may.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
first,
because
of
what
has
been
said
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
part
and
a
combination
of
a
fact.
a
--
the
union's
elections
are
held
periodically
and
specifically
have
to
be
held
periodically
according
to
constitution
and
by
laws.
the
secretary
volunteered
a
statement
on
the
footnote
in
his
brief
that
there
were
approximately
three-and-a-half
million
union
members
whose
elections
are
held
either
no
--
more
frequently
than
once
a
year
or
once
every
two
years.
there
are
approximately
17
million
members
at
least
putting
the
figure
very
modestly
under
in
members
of
unions
who
presumably
have
terms
of
office
for
their
offices
of
three
years,
which
is
the
maximum
allowed
under
the
statute.
of
the
three-and-a-half
million,
approximately
50%
or
more
are
under
the
two-year
rule,
the
same
as
are
the
international
unions
--
local
union's
requirements
are.
now,
if
the
secretary
--
if
the
secretary
were
to
proceed
with
the
dispatch
available
to
them
under
the
direction
of
the
circuit
court's
judgments,
after
the
seventh
month
from
the
holding
of
the
election
and
the
making,
the
rising
of
the
complaint,
the
secretary
is
first
before
the
courts
and
he
goes
through
the
process
of
appearing
on
a
summary
calendar,
have
this
matter
litigated
long
before
the
expiration
maybe
of
a
set
two
year
term
as
certainly
much
longer
before
the
expiration
of
the
three-year
term.
so
this
“laboratory”
election
with
the
word,
mr.
(inaudible)
is
applies
to
these
proceedings
as
no
connection
with
any
labor
board
proceeding.
he
would
have
his
election
within
that
one
year
or
the
two
years
or
whatever
it
might
be.
there's
nothing
to
stop
the
secretary
from
moving
promptly
which
he
has
yet
to
failed
to
do,
he
even
put
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
recommendations
to
test.
i
say
that
with
all
sincerity,
we
evaluated
this
by
calendar
and
by
review
and
by
applications.
we
strongly
feel
that
the
secretary
would
have
an
election
directed
by
the
court
if
the
rule
was
found
to
be
invalid
or
whatever
the
procedure
was
before
the
expiration
of
the
thn
existing
term
of
laws
he
has
under
attack.
but
to
say
that
sometime
in
the
future
he
has
a
right
to
come
into
a
second
election,
absent
any
complaint
by
a
member
and
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
findings
might
have
been
in
the
first
election
without
all
the
peripheral
questions
that
arise
as
to
whether
it
was
positively
applied
or
whether
people
actually
got
their
excuses,
at
least
--
at
least
the
secretary
had
a
right
that
does
not
appear
in
the
statute
and
anywhere
either
by
inference
or
direction
or
by
conclusion
certainly
as
directly
opposite
to
the
entire
history
that
the
legislative
discussions
show
us
to
be
existent
in
this
matter.
i'm
not
trying
to
(voice
overlap)
word,
sir,
but
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
as
the
late
senator
kennedy
said,
he
was
acting
as
the
particular
grievance
or
complainant's
lawyer
and
i
would
say
that
the
public
interest
is
a
substantial
part,
nevertheless,
keeping
in
mind
that
local
unions
are
charged
under
the
statute
and
under
the
language
surrounding
the
statute,
the
history
was
trying
to
clear
up
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
house.
it
does
not
go
with
that
kind
of
public
interest
that
the
secretary
chooses
to
qualify
himself
because
as
pointed
out
in
this
case,
the
very
facts
in
this
case
show
that
we
moved
with
all
dispatch
to
clear
up
this
matter
and
met
judge
dumbauld's
recommendations
after
long
colloquy
with
the
secretary
and
his
associates,
i
personally
participated
some
of
them,
that
we
could
get
nowhere.
the
secretary
of
labor
in
his
response
to
judge
--
to
mr.
minton's
letter
in
august
of
1966,
said
in
effect
no
rule
is
satisfactory
to
be
contrary
to
what
judge
dumbauld
said,
what
kind
of
a
laboratory
election
could
we
have
where
the
secretary
himself
would
not
even
be
willing
to
abide
by
judge
dumbauld's
decision?
so
we
reached
an
anomalous
situation
everywhere
which
we
way
we
turn
about
using
and
applying
the
broad
spectrum
of
the
secretary's
wishes
to
the
facts
at
hand.
we
could
only
deal
with
the
case
as
we
find
it
not
presuppose
or
assume
facts
that
don't
exist.
to
a
large
as
local
union
--
these
rules
to
include
any
number
of
excuses
plus
an
assurance
of
a
group
of
candidates
under
any
circumstances,
at
the
time
when
the
secretary
had
made
it
known
to
his
own
publications
that
he
certainly
could
not
find
“with
the
50%
rule”
that
was
in
existent
part
of
the
secretary's
published
handbook.
that
leaves
us
deeply
concerned
with
this
suggestion
for
laboratory
election
at
that
time
when
there's
no
complaint,
the
union
presumably
has
done
or
is
doing
things
it
should
be
doing
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
and
validly
elective
officers
being
disturbed
in
their
term
by
an
election
like
this
now.
there
is
another
--
this
is
now
the
second
intervening
election
having
taken
place.
the
secretary
wants
it
now.
there
are
people
who
are
elected
to
office
who
may
have
had
no
connection
at
all
or
any
concern
with
this
matter,
not
only
here
but
in
other
local
unions
as
well.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
yes.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
there
were
approximately
ten,
i
believe,
ten
or
eleven.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
yes.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
ten,
i
believe.
that
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
may
i
--
yes,
your
honor
--
may
i
comment
on
your
question,
chief
justice?
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i'm
--
and
when
--
yes,
it
does
for
this
reason,
sir.
we
have
a
number
of
facets
to
consider
when
we
looked
upon
the
question
of
reasonableness
on
the
rule.
we're
not
dealing
with
bare
statistics
here.
first
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
with
bare
statistics.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
first,
we
must
remember
that
the
agreed
upon
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
to
give
an
educational
background
and
understanding
to
candidates
as
to
what
their
union
means
and
how
it
can
function.
that's
agreed.
the
secretary
agrees
that's
fine.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
second
--
secondly,
the
availability
of
the
meeting
place,
the
hours,
door
prices
being
offered
by
the
union
--
that's
all
in
the
record
--
to
have
people
come.
this
wasn't
any
invidious
of
the
equal
weight.
they
offered
a
door
price,
each
meeting
night,
where
--
when
the
meeting
was
held,
to
encourage
people
to
come.
come
and
be
a
candidate.
these
people
chose
not
to
come
deliberately.
they
did
not.
the
rule
did
not
put
them
beyond
the
scope
of
eligibility.
they
decided
to
go
to
the
baseball
game,
look
at
television
or
got
to
the
movie,
wherever
they
did
but
they
chose
between
two
of
their
courses
of
action.
now
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
the
only
reason
that
was
because
some
eligible
people
didn't
want
to
run.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
some
of
the
ten
don't
want
to
run.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
right.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
it's
part
of
the
same
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
must
draw
my
recollection.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
must
draw
my
recollection
and
say
i
believe
they
withdrew
--
they
drew
on
people
who
here
who
had
a
larger
amount
of
--
the
largest
amount
of
attendance
there
or
people
whom
they
thought
qualified.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
can't
really
say.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
who
were
ineligible
to
run,
yes,
because
the
candidates
who
were
eligible
to
run,
some
refused
to
either
stand
for
nomination
or
even
take
the
position.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
can't
tell
you,
sir.
it
might
have
been
the
president
and
the
vice,
i
can't
really
say
to
you
specifically.
the
officers,
the
elected
officers,
i
presume.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
oh!
yes,
the
membership
would
have
to
and
would
be
done
at
the
union
meeting
with
the
membership
approval.
yes,
these
actually
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
no,
you
see
at
any
given
meeting,
there
would
be
a
large
number
people.
it's
the
lack
of
consistency
of
attendance
that
would
take
place.
it
wasn't
that
--
it's
hard
to
draw
the
picture
word
wise
when
you
realized
that
for
one
thing
any
number
of
these
folks
work
in
night
work
had
an
automatic
excuse.
they
are
automatically
excused.
some
people
can
attend
only
eight
or
nine
meetings
in
two
years,
he
would
be
eligible.
that's
one
facet
of
this
matter.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
these
people
do
come
to
meetings
but
choose
to
come,
i
will
say
two,
four,
five
meetings
a
year
whatever
they
choose
to
do.
at
any
given
time,
there
could
be
substantial
numbers
of
people
in
the
meeting
hall
but
not
the
same
people
who
were
there
that
the
week
--
the
month
before.
but
it
isn't
a
picture
of
deliberateness
or
finality
that
attaches
all
to
a
procedure
that
admittedly
is
desirable,
not
only
from
our
standpoint
but
the
hue
and
cry
on
our
nation
today
is
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
encourage
union
membership.
the
national
labor
relations
board,
not
more
than
--
approximately
nine
months
ago,
it
overturned
a
rule
of
18
years
standing
in
which
it
authorized
the
giving
back
of
increase
the
union
dues
as
attendance
reward.
in
order
to
encourage,
l
said
so
that
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
encourage
union
attendance.
and
in
every
which
way,
we
turned
this
--
this
we
want
people
to
come
to
union
meetings.
we
encourage
it
in
anyway
possible.
and
as
i
say,
we
have
largely
excused
areas
--
areas
to
meet
the
situation.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
know
i
do
have,
sir.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
whether
my
strength
is
holding
out,
so
i
don't
have
to
sit
down.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
do
want
to
take
a
few
moments
to
comment,
to
comment
on
the
aspect
of
the
case
dealing
with
having
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
with
your
permission.
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
if
you
find
that
the
mootness
position
taken
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
has
to
be
sustained.
now,
in
this
case,
as
we
know
for
reading
of
the
record
in
judge
dumbauld's
decision,
this
rule
was
not
held
to
be
unreasonable
as
such.
it
was
only
as
with
respect
to
the
excused
areas
that
were
limited
that
may
be
application
out
of
it
under
those
particular
circumstances,
and
his
opinion
unreasonable,
with
substantial
suggestions
on
how
it
could
be
corrected
in
his
opinion
which
i
indicated
was
followed.
now,
in
this
instance,
it
held
that
the
secretary
must
show
that
a
willing
candidate
was
disqualified
by
the
illegal
rule.
this
is
the
secretary
was
unable
to
do.
the
only
evidence
he
had
or
was
introduced
was
that
one
candidate
and
only
one
candidate
was
disqualified
by
the
75%
rule
because
he
was
absent
a
meeting
in
which
it
was
held.
that
candidate,
gentlemen,
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court,
was
the
treasurer
of
the
local
union
who
had
founded
very
convenient
and
easy
to
qualify
for
the
1959
election
which
he
won
as
treasurer,
the
1961
election
in
which
he
won
as
treasurer,
and
when
he
absented
himself
from
a
number
of
meetings
in
spite
of
his
responsibilities
as
the
treasury
report
of
the
financial
affairs
of
the
local
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unfortunately
as
it
may
be,
this
gentlemen
proved
to
be
something
less
than
truthful
before
the
court
and
the
areas
of
excuse
that
he
told
the
government
he
was
entitled
to
receive
when
he
reported
to
the
secretary
in
his
complaint
and
which
he
intended
which
he
testified
to
the
court
as
being
the
areas
of
absence
were
periods
of
time
when
he
claimed
to
be
ill
but
which
he
--
which,
by
the
record,
he
usually
had
attended
the
union
meetings.
so
that
--
as
judge
dumbauld
very
properly
found
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
witness
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
and
all
the
facts,
he
found
himself
an
individual
who
for
reasons
he
never
explained
and
could
not
explain,
did
not
come
to
six
meetings
that
were
easily
available
to
him
at
the
time
when
he
should
have
come
as
an
officer,
though
that
may
not
be
the
criteria,
that's
the
whole
factual
picture
here.
we
find
ourselves
that
the
--
we
find
ourselves
that
the
--
there
was
nobody
else
complaining
that
the
candidate
did
not
have
a
valid
excuse
for
not
coming
to
a
sufficient
number
of
meetings
and
that
there
was
not
a
willing
candidate
who
was
disqualified
by
virtue
of
this
rule.
the
fact
support
that
position
amply
and
completely,
and
that
we
have
no
basis
in
fact
or
in
law
for
the
setting
aside
of
this
election
on
the
ground
that
it
affected
the
outcome,
that
the
events
that
occurred
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
insofar
as
the
complainant
was
concerned
and
suddenly
the
secretary
could
have
as
to
the
extent
of
investigatory
powers
have
ascertained
as
there
are
any
other
persons
who
are
similarly
affected.
may
i
close
on
this
note
and
this
is
most
meaningful
for
me
because
i
was
exposed
to
it
as
early
--
or
as
recently
as
april
this
year
when
in
a
similar
case,
a
very
fine
person
testifying
before
a
district
court
judge
testify
--
stated
that
when
she
was
asked
why
she
had
did
not
qualify
or
was
not
eligible
for
office,
said
that
she
deliberately
absented
herself
from
meetings
and
didn't
seek
an
excuse
so
that
she
would
not
be
called
upon
to
stand
for
candidacy
and
turn
her
people
down
because
she
had
too
many,
she
was
a
married
woman
and
had
home
problems
and
just
didn't
want
to
disappoint
her
friends.
this
is
her
testimony
before
the
court
and
i
say
to
you,
we
cannot
unless
we
delve
into
these
--
the
background
of
these
facts
ascertain
whether
the
490
people,
members
of
local
of
--
local
union
wanted
to
be
candidates.
i
am
sure,
i
can
close
this
meaningfulness
this
by
stating
to
you
from
my
personal
experience
and
i'm
sure
from
statistics
that
were
available
that
a
huge
majority
of
cases,
trade
union
elections
find
themselves
where
there
are
no
office
or
position
for
office.
there
are
no
opposing
candidates.
there
were
any
number
of
elections
so
that
whether
--
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
10
candidates
under
our
rule
or
only
ten
candidate
because
of
a
single
candidacy
position
and
itself
does
not
prove
impropriety
of
the
election.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
would
have
to
take
a
review
on
that
carefully
because
i
believe
that
we
--
that
we
tailor
the
record
to
meet
these
particular
questions
and
i
would
really
--
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
review
your
question
and
respond
to
the
court
in
writing,
if
i
may,
the
response
for
me
to
do
so.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
with
the
permission
of
the
court
mr.
albert
k.
plone
--
chief
justice.
these
two
cases,
numbers
57
and
58
are
the
first
cases
before
the
court
dealing
with
title
iv
of
the
act.
they
raised
three
issues.
does
a
second
regularly
scheduled
election
held
vague
and
moot
a
suit
by
the
secretary
to
set
aside
a
prior
election.
and
does
the
meaning
of
the
requirements
contained
in
section
402
(c)
of
the
act
that
in
order
to
set
aside
an
election,
the
secretary
must
prove
that
the
alleged
violation
may
have
had
an
effect
to
the
outcome
of
the
election.
and
third,
whether
the
secretary
has
cart
launch
to
raise
issues
all
of
those
that
the
union
members
has
raised.
as
to
the
last,
that
is
not
in
our
case.
it
will
be
in
the
next
following
case.
our
position
is
that
as
to
all
these
three
issues,
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
expand
the
very
limited
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
congress.
at
the
start,
it
is
well
connoted
that
these
contested
issues
are
merely
the
visible
portion
of
the
iceberg
with
beneath
of
which
lies
the
great
statutory
inhibitions
that
affect
the
operation
of
unions
as
placed
upon
them
under
the
1959
statute.
it
is
clear
that
congress
gave
the
secretary
authority
to
act
in
this
instance
as
the
union
members'
lawyer
as
stated
by
the
senators
and
the
late
senator
kennedy
in
that
regard,
and
i
will
refer
to
it
later,
the
original
draft
of
the
bill
that
was
introduced,
that
account
was
specifically
made
and
remains
throughout
the
text
of
the
legislative
history.
in
this
role,
the
secretary
has
the
authority
under
section
402
of
the
act
to
seek
an
election
challenged
by
a
union
member,
who
has
exhausted
his
internal
remedies,
set
aside
on
the
ground
raised
by
the
member
if
he
can
prove
that
the
election
was
invalid
and
the
invalidity
may
have
affected
the
outcome.
moreover,
he
has
a
broad
authority
under
section
601
continuously
to
investigate
union
elections
or
any
other
union
affairs
and
report
his
findings
to
the
membership.
this
basic
authority,
while
it
is
circumscribed
worth
a
revolution
in
the
amount
of
allowable
governmental
intervention
into
intenal
union
affairs.
thus,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
the
respondents
prevail
in
this
court,
the
government's
supervisory
increase
in
the
powers
over
union,
elections
will
still
be
quite
considerable.
the
real
question
presented
is
whether
the
supervising
power
will
be
limited
as
congress
intended
or
unlimited
as
the
secretary
wishes
it
to
be.
both
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
limited
and
very
limited
power
in
that
area.
the
drafters
and
supporters
of
title
iv
recognized
that
the
public
interest
in
union
democracy
required
a
balancing
between
preservation
of
the
union
autonomy
and
membership
control
of
their
organization.
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
government
in
support
on
the
other,
as
the
majority
report
of
the
senate
labor
committee
stated,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
page
21
of
the
amicus
brief,
“given
the
maintenance
of
minimum
democratic
safeguards
and
detailed
essential
information
about
the
union,
the
individual
members
are
fully
competent
to
regulate
union
affairs”.
the
committee
strongly
opposes
any
attempt
to
prescribe
detailed
procedural
--
procedures
and
standards
for
the
conduct
of
union
business.
such
paternalistic
regulation
would
weaken
rather
than
strengthen
the
labor
movement.
it
would
crossover
into
the
area
of
trading
and
licensing
and
destroyed
union
independence.
as
we
proceed
through
the
facts
in
this
case,
gentlemen
of
the
court,
we
find
that
there
is
a
remarkable
absence
of
predicate
where
the
secretary
is
concerned
about
the
affairs
of
this
and
other
trade
unions.
may
i
first
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that,
in
response
to
the
question
by
justice
fortas,
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
and
almost
immediate
strong
effort
made
to
correct
or
let's
say
modify
the
rule
as
indicated
by
the
trial
judge
in
his
decision.
the
facts
briefly
are
in
that
area;
that
judge
dumbauld
rendered
his
decision
on
august
26th,
1965
with
the
local
union's
election
being
scheduled
for
early
october
2nd,
tuesday
i
believe
or
thursday
in
october,
that
the
local
union
had
already,
under
its
constitutional
requirements
set
forth
in
so-called
constitutional
bylaws
had
one
nomination
meeting
early
in
august,
and
the
second
nomination
meeting
in
september,
and
eligibility
had
already
been
determined
under
the
then
validly
existing
rule
because
the
statute
states
specifically
that
the
union's
election
in
its
procedures
are
considered
valid
unless
changed
and
until
changed
by
a
court
decree.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
if
your
--
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
i
can't
say
concretely
for
this
reason,
sir,
that
even
in
the
first
case,
this
gentleman
who
complained
of
not
have
being
--
are
being
held
eligible,
had
been
given
credit
for
one
meeting
that
he
did
not
attend
because
of
his
wife's
illness,
so
i
can't
honestly
say
that
the
rule
was
being
conducted
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
the
rule
was
the
same,
sir,
insofar
as
we
know
but
was
in
the
process
of
being
changed.
that's
all
i
could
say
as
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
my
deep
concern
is
a
matter
of
the
cause
my
intimate
relationship
with
them,
and
i
watched
this
matter
for
progressed
and
perhaps
would
like
to
proceed
in
that
specific
fashion
if
you
will
forgive
me.
we
were
deeply
concerned
and
i
speak
i
am
sure
for
all
labor
when
the
secretary
advances
the
position
that
absent
a
complaint
by
a
member,
and
that's
what
the
third
circuit
court
indicated
or
stated,
that
the
secretary
has
a
right
to
walk
into
a
local
union
and
conduct
another
election.
now,
there's
a
very
interesting
factual
background
here
that
i
say,
this
is
my
personal
knowledge,
that
the
secretary
should
know,
that
there
were
some
30
odd
members
of
the
local
union
in
the
courtroom
when
this
case
was
being
tried
at
the
request
of
the
secretary.
the
only
witness
that
the
secretary
brought
forth
was
the
complainant
himself
and
the
secretary
sought
to
it
that
the
decision
of
judge
dumbauld
was
spread
over
the
newspapers
in
that
small
community
of
washington,
pennsylvania
because
i
saw
these
copies
myself,
as
well
as
in
the
pittsburgh
papers.
and
the
entire
community,
which
is
composed
substantially
of
glass
workers
was
well
aware
what
was
going
on
as
early
as
august
1965,
we
have
the
judge
dumbauld
decision
and
i
say
this
with
true
humbleness,
based
upon
experience,
that
in
my
opinion,
the
membership
was
satisfied
with
that
rule.
i
say
that
most
meaningfully
because
no
--
not
only
because
no
complaint
came
forth
but
in
another
case,
it
is
--
this
rule
has
been
used
by
members
to
deliberately
avoid
candidacy
because
he
didn't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
turning
down
candidacy.
however,
that's
on
the
side.
let
me
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
member
who
came
forth
to
complain
about
this
rule.
i
--
the
secretary
attempts
to
meet
our
argument
by
stating
that
once
an
allegedly
unlawful
election
takes
place,
he
must
have
the
authority
to
ave
a
rerun
election,
to
remove
the
taint
of
the
prior
election.
in
other
words,
he
suggests
that
he
has
broad
regulatory
powers
that
would
entitle
him
to
set
aside
a
presumptively
valid
election,
even
if
he
can't
meet
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
statute
requires.
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlined,
we
believe
that
the
secretary's
argument
indicates
that
he
is
seeking
to
push
to
one
side,
the
delicate
balance
congress
struck
in
order
to
broaden
his
powers.
and
as
has
been
stated
in
other
decisions,
vying
to
this
very
important
constitutional
question,
the
lesson
of
his
pre-teaches
that
the
enlargement
of
a
particular
power,
however,
in
that
one
all
too
frequently
that
leads
to
abuse
and
disastrous
consequences.
and
i
say
most
meaningfully,
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
the
very
purpose
that
this
act
intended
was
being
fully
met.
in
1963,
the
election
in
question
was
held.
in
due
course,
the
matter
was
reached
the
stage
of
litigation
and
disposition.
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
hearing
in
this
case,
meetings
were
held
with
the
secretary
of
labor
as
subsequent
to
the
decision,
meetings
continued
to
be
held
and
as
stated
in
the
record
on
page
--
page
58,
“in
june
1966,
after
meetings
were
held
with
the
secretary
personally
by
the
president
minton
of
international
union,
not
a
slight
variation
of
this
rule
was
dealt
with
but
spelt
out
before
you
a
very
substantial
number
of
excuse
areas
wherein
instilled
in
this
rule
to
a
point
where
it
gives
every
member
an
opportunity
used
for
almost
any
reasonable
occurrence
that
might
take
away
from
the
union
meeting.
now,
before
i
proceed
further,
let
me
again
point
out,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
when
the
government
--
when
the
secretary
started
to
process
this
matter,
there
were
two
important
questions
that
were
to
be
resolved,
one
was,
by
stipulation
modeled
by
judge
dumbauld
himself.
by
stipulation,
the
secretary
agreed
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
laudable.
it
was
a
desirable
rule
that
had
for
its
purpose,
not
only
membership
attendance
but
equal
as
important
or
more
important
a
background
of
knowledge
on
how
a
local
union
functions
by
anyone
of
the
sought
candidacy,
that
where
a
raw
recruit
come
in
without
that
background
would
be
and
has
proven
to
be
disastrous.
that
is
by
agreement
with
the
government
that
such
was
the
purpose
of
the
rule
that
was
passed
in
1957.
and
secondly,
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
wyner,
counsel
for
the
secretary
and
judge
dumbauld
at
the
pre-trial
conference
which
is
part
of
the
record,
he
stated
specifically
that
there
was
no
venality
connected
with
this
whole
proceeding.
there
was
no
charge
of
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
unions'
officers,
but
only
that
there
was
a
rule
which
the
secretary
considered
unreasonable
because
of
the
numbers
game
that
was
being
played.
may
i
further
say
that
there
are
at
least
15
or
16
or
may
be
17
international
unions
based
upon
the
secretary's
own
statistics
that
have
membership
requirement
attendance
such
as
ours.
there
are
only
--
there
were
only
two
at
that
time.
it
was
75%
but
again,
there
was
50%
attendance
and
so
forth,
majority
were
50%.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
50%
or
75%
or
attendance
requirements
as
to
numbers
of
meeting
that
was
at
stake.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
would
say
essentially,
yes,
sir
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
no,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
say
it
very
specifically..
the
first
election
was
held
under
secreteray
(inaudible).
the
second
election,
it
is
the
basic
predicate
of
the
act
as
we
see
the
act
that
each
election
as
an
independent
function
of
the
union
has
to
be
separately
considered
by
the
secretary,
that
the
second
election
must
be
preceded
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
by
an
individual
member
who
complains
of
that
election.
absent
to
that
complaint,
that
election
is
presumed
by
the
statutory
language
to
be
valid
that
the
“taint”
that
is
talked
about
here
does
not
carry
over
to
the
secretary's
right
to
proceed
in
the
area
of
litigation
or
a
holding
of
government
election,
that
he
is
bound
by
the
specific
language
of
402
(a)
through
(c)
all
interdependent.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
the
reason
--
that
that's
--
the
reason
is
other
than
mootness
in
that
one
respect
that
each
election
stands
on
its
own
two
feet.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
a
question
--
pardon
me.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
don't
intend
that
comment
to
bring
at
all
but
i'd
like
to
explain
my
answer,
if
i
may.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
first,
because
of
what
has
been
said
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
part
and
a
combination
of
a
fact.
a
--
the
union's
elections
are
held
periodically
and
specifically
have
to
be
held
periodically
according
to
constitution
and
by
laws.
the
secretary
volunteered
a
statement
on
the
footnote
in
his
brief
that
there
were
approximately
three-and-a-half
million
union
members
whose
elections
are
held
either
no
--
more
frequently
than
once
a
year
or
once
every
two
years.
there
are
approximately
17
million
members
at
least
putting
the
figure
very
modestly
under
in
members
of
unions
who
presumably
have
terms
of
office
for
their
offices
of
three
years,
which
is
the
maximum
allowed
under
the
statute.
of
the
three-and-a-half
million,
approximately
50%
or
more
are
under
the
two-year
rule,
the
same
as
are
the
international
unions
--
local
union's
requirements
are.
now,
if
the
secretary
--
if
the
secretary
were
to
proceed
with
the
dispatch
available
to
them
under
the
direction
of
the
circuit
court's
judgments,
after
the
seventh
month
from
the
holding
of
the
election
and
the
making,
the
rising
of
the
complaint,
the
secretary
is
first
before
the
courts
and
he
goes
through
the
process
of
appearing
on
a
summary
calendar,
have
this
matter
litigated
long
before
the
expiration
maybe
of
a
set
two
year
term
as
certainly
much
longer
before
the
expiration
of
the
three-year
term.
so
this
“laboratory”
election
with
the
word,
mr.
(inaudible)
is
applies
to
these
proceedings
as
no
connection
with
any
labor
board
proceeding.
he
would
have
his
election
within
that
one
year
or
the
two
years
or
whatever
it
might
be.
there's
nothing
to
stop
the
secretary
from
moving
promptly
which
he
has
yet
to
failed
to
do,
he
even
put
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
recommendations
to
test.
i
say
that
with
all
sincerity,
we
evaluated
this
by
calendar
and
by
review
and
by
applications.
we
strongly
feel
that
the
secretary
would
have
an
election
directed
by
the
court
if
the
rule
was
found
to
be
invalid
or
whatever
the
procedure
was
before
the
expiration
of
the
thn
existing
term
of
laws
he
has
under
attack.
but
to
say
that
sometime
in
the
future
he
has
a
right
to
come
into
a
second
election,
absent
any
complaint
by
a
member
and
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
findings
might
have
been
in
the
first
election
without
all
the
peripheral
questions
that
arise
as
to
whether
it
was
positively
applied
or
whether
people
actually
got
their
excuses,
at
least
--
at
least
the
secretary
had
a
right
that
does
not
appear
in
the
statute
and
anywhere
either
by
inference
or
direction
or
by
conclusion
certainly
as
directly
opposite
to
the
entire
history
that
the
legislative
discussions
show
us
to
be
existent
in
this
matter.
i'm
not
trying
to
(voice
overlap)
word,
sir,
but
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
well,
as
the
late
senator
kennedy
said,
he
was
acting
as
the
particular
grievance
or
complainant's
lawyer
and
i
would
say
that
the
public
interest
is
a
substantial
part,
nevertheless,
keeping
in
mind
that
local
unions
are
charged
under
the
statute
and
under
the
language
surrounding
the
statute,
the
history
was
trying
to
clear
up
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
house.
it
does
not
go
with
that
kind
of
public
interest
that
the
secretary
chooses
to
qualify
himself
because
as
pointed
out
in
this
case,
the
very
facts
in
this
case
show
that
we
moved
with
all
dispatch
to
clear
up
this
matter
and
met
judge
dumbauld's
recommendations
after
long
colloquy
with
the
secretary
and
his
associates,
i
personally
participated
some
of
them,
that
we
could
get
nowhere.
the
secretary
of
labor
in
his
response
to
judge
--
to
mr.
minton's
letter
in
august
of
1966,
said
in
effect
no
rule
is
satisfactory
to
be
contrary
to
what
judge
dumbauld
said,
what
kind
of
a
laboratory
election
could
we
have
where
the
secretary
himself
would
not
even
be
willing
to
abide
by
judge
dumbauld's
decision?
so
we
reached
an
anomalous
situation
everywhere
which
we
way
we
turn
about
using
and
applying
the
broad
spectrum
of
the
secretary's
wishes
to
the
facts
at
hand.
we
could
only
deal
with
the
case
as
we
find
it
not
presuppose
or
assume
facts
that
don't
exist.
to
a
large
as
local
union
--
these
rules
to
include
any
number
of
excuses
plus
an
assurance
of
a
group
of
candidates
under
any
circumstances,
at
the
time
when
the
secretary
had
made
it
known
to
his
own
publications
that
he
certainly
could
not
find
“with
the
50%
rule”
that
was
in
existent
part
of
the
secretary's
published
handbook.
that
leaves
us
deeply
concerned
with
this
suggestion
for
laboratory
election
at
that
time
when
there's
no
complaint,
the
union
presumably
has
done
or
is
doing
things
it
should
be
doing
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
and
validly
elective
officers
being
disturbed
in
their
term
by
an
election
like
this
now.
there
is
another
--
this
is
now
the
second
intervening
election
having
taken
place.
the
secretary
wants
it
now.
there
are
people
who
are
elected
to
office
who
may
have
had
no
connection
at
all
or
any
concern
with
this
matter,
not
only
here
but
in
other
local
unions
as
well.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
yes.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
there
were
approximately
ten,
i
believe,
ten
or
eleven.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
yes.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
ten,
i
believe.
that
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
may
i
--
yes,
your
honor
--
may
i
comment
on
your
question,
chief
justice?
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i'm
--
and
when
--
yes,
it
does
for
this
reason,
sir.
we
have
a
number
of
facets
to
consider
when
we
looked
upon
the
question
of
reasonableness
on
the
rule.
we're
not
dealing
with
bare
statistics
here.
first
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
with
bare
statistics.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
first,
we
must
remember
that
the
agreed
upon
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
to
give
an
educational
background
and
understanding
to
candidates
as
to
what
their
union
means
and
how
it
can
function.
that's
agreed.
the
secretary
agrees
that's
fine.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
second
--
secondly,
the
availability
of
the
meeting
place,
the
hours,
door
prices
being
offered
by
the
union
--
that's
all
in
the
record
--
to
have
people
come.
this
wasn't
any
invidious
of
the
equal
weight.
they
offered
a
door
price,
each
meeting
night,
where
--
when
the
meeting
was
held,
to
encourage
people
to
come.
come
and
be
a
candidate.
these
people
chose
not
to
come
deliberately.
they
did
not.
the
rule
did
not
put
them
beyond
the
scope
of
eligibility.
they
decided
to
go
to
the
baseball
game,
look
at
television
or
got
to
the
movie,
wherever
they
did
but
they
chose
between
two
of
their
courses
of
action.
now
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
the
only
reason
that
was
because
some
eligible
people
didn't
want
to
run.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
some
of
the
ten
don't
want
to
run.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
that's
right.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
it's
part
of
the
same
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
must
draw
my
recollection.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
must
draw
my
recollection
and
say
i
believe
they
withdrew
--
they
drew
on
people
who
here
who
had
a
larger
amount
of
--
the
largest
amount
of
attendance
there
or
people
whom
they
thought
qualified.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
can't
really
say.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
who
were
ineligible
to
run,
yes,
because
the
candidates
who
were
eligible
to
run,
some
refused
to
either
stand
for
nomination
or
even
take
the
position.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
can't
tell
you,
sir.
it
might
have
been
the
president
and
the
vice,
i
can't
really
say
to
you
specifically.
the
officers,
the
elected
officers,
i
presume.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
oh!
yes,
the
membership
would
have
to
and
would
be
done
at
the
union
meeting
with
the
membership
approval.
yes,
these
actually
--
mr.
albert
k.
plone
no,
you
see
at
any
given
meeting,
there
would
be
a
large
number
people.
it's
the
lack
of
consistency
of
attendance
that
would
take
place.
it
wasn't
that
--
it's
hard
to
draw
the
picture
word
wise
when
you
realized
that
for
one
thing
any
number
of
these
folks
work
in
night
work
had
an
automatic
excuse.
they
are
automatically
excused.
some
people
can
attend
only
eight
or
nine
meetings
in
two
years,
he
would
be
eligible.
that's
one
facet
of
this
matter.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
these
people
do
come
to
meetings
but
choose
to
come,
i
will
say
two,
four,
five
meetings
a
year
whatever
they
choose
to
do.
at
any
given
time,
there
could
be
substantial
numbers
of
people
in
the
meeting
hall
but
not
the
same
people
who
were
there
that
the
week
--
the
month
before.
but
it
isn't
a
picture
of
deliberateness
or
finality
that
attaches
all
to
a
procedure
that
admittedly
is
desirable,
not
only
from
our
standpoint
but
the
hue
and
cry
on
our
nation
today
is
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
encourage
union
membership.
the
national
labor
relations
board,
not
more
than
--
approximately
nine
months
ago,
it
overturned
a
rule
of
18
years
standing
in
which
it
authorized
the
giving
back
of
increase
the
union
dues
as
attendance
reward.
in
order
to
encourage,
l
said
so
that
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
encourage
union
attendance.
and
in
every
which
way,
we
turned
this
--
this
we
want
people
to
come
to
union
meetings.
we
encourage
it
in
anyway
possible.
and
as
i
say,
we
have
largely
excused
areas
--
areas
to
meet
the
situation.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
know
i
do
have,
sir.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
whether
my
strength
is
holding
out,
so
i
don't
have
to
sit
down.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
do
want
to
take
a
few
moments
to
comment,
to
comment
on
the
aspect
of
the
case
dealing
with
having
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
with
your
permission.
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
if
you
find
that
the
mootness
position
taken
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
has
to
be
sustained.
now,
in
this
case,
as
we
know
for
reading
of
the
record
in
judge
dumbauld's
decision,
this
rule
was
not
held
to
be
unreasonable
as
such.
it
was
only
as
with
respect
to
the
excused
areas
that
were
limited
that
may
be
application
out
of
it
under
those
particular
circumstances,
and
his
opinion
unreasonable,
with
substantial
suggestions
on
how
it
could
be
corrected
in
his
opinion
which
i
indicated
was
followed.
now,
in
this
instance,
it
held
that
the
secretary
must
show
that
a
willing
candidate
was
disqualified
by
the
illegal
rule.
this
is
the
secretary
was
unable
to
do.
the
only
evidence
he
had
or
was
introduced
was
that
one
candidate
and
only
one
candidate
was
disqualified
by
the
75%
rule
because
he
was
absent
a
meeting
in
which
it
was
held.
that
candidate,
gentlemen,
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court,
was
the
treasurer
of
the
local
union
who
had
founded
very
convenient
and
easy
to
qualify
for
the
1959
election
which
he
won
as
treasurer,
the
1961
election
in
which
he
won
as
treasurer,
and
when
he
absented
himself
from
a
number
of
meetings
in
spite
of
his
responsibilities
as
the
treasury
report
of
the
financial
affairs
of
the
local
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unfortunately
as
it
may
be,
this
gentlemen
proved
to
be
something
less
than
truthful
before
the
court
and
the
areas
of
excuse
that
he
told
the
government
he
was
entitled
to
receive
when
he
reported
to
the
secretary
in
his
complaint
and
which
he
intended
which
he
testified
to
the
court
as
being
the
areas
of
absence
were
periods
of
time
when
he
claimed
to
be
ill
but
which
he
--
which,
by
the
record,
he
usually
had
attended
the
union
meetings.
so
that
--
as
judge
dumbauld
very
properly
found
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
witness
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
and
all
the
facts,
he
found
himself
an
individual
who
for
reasons
he
never
explained
and
could
not
explain,
did
not
come
to
six
meetings
that
were
easily
available
to
him
at
the
time
when
he
should
have
come
as
an
officer,
though
that
may
not
be
the
criteria,
that's
the
whole
factual
picture
here.
we
find
ourselves
that
the
--
we
find
ourselves
that
the
--
there
was
nobody
else
complaining
that
the
candidate
did
not
have
a
valid
excuse
for
not
coming
to
a
sufficient
number
of
meetings
and
that
there
was
not
a
willing
candidate
who
was
disqualified
by
virtue
of
this
rule.
the
fact
support
that
position
amply
and
completely,
and
that
we
have
no
basis
in
fact
or
in
law
for
the
setting
aside
of
this
election
on
the
ground
that
it
affected
the
outcome,
that
the
events
that
occurred
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
insofar
as
the
complainant
was
concerned
and
suddenly
the
secretary
could
have
as
to
the
extent
of
investigatory
powers
have
ascertained
as
there
are
any
other
persons
who
are
similarly
affected.
may
i
close
on
this
note
and
this
is
most
meaningful
for
me
because
i
was
exposed
to
it
as
early
--
or
as
recently
as
april
this
year
when
in
a
similar
case,
a
very
fine
person
testifying
before
a
district
court
judge
testify
--
stated
that
when
she
was
asked
why
she
had
did
not
qualify
or
was
not
eligible
for
office,
said
that
she
deliberately
absented
herself
from
meetings
and
didn't
seek
an
excuse
so
that
she
would
not
be
called
upon
to
stand
for
candidacy
and
turn
her
people
down
because
she
had
too
many,
she
was
a
married
woman
and
had
home
problems
and
just
didn't
want
to
disappoint
her
friends.
this
is
her
testimony
before
the
court
and
i
say
to
you,
we
cannot
unless
we
delve
into
these
--
the
background
of
these
facts
ascertain
whether
the
490
people,
members
of
local
of
--
local
union
wanted
to
be
candidates.
i
am
sure,
i
can
close
this
meaningfulness
this
by
stating
to
you
from
my
personal
experience
and
i'm
sure
from
statistics
that
were
available
that
a
huge
majority
of
cases,
trade
union
elections
find
themselves
where
there
are
no
office
or
position
for
office.
there
are
no
opposing
candidates.
there
were
any
number
of
elections
so
that
whether
--
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
10
candidates
under
our
rule
or
only
ten
candidate
because
of
a
single
candidacy
position
and
itself
does
not
prove
impropriety
of
the
election.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
k.
plone
i
would
have
to
take
a
review
on
that
carefully
because
i
believe
that
we
--
that
we
tailor
the
record
to
meet
these
particular
questions
and
i
would
really
--
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
review
your
question
and
respond
to
the
court
in
writing,
if
i
may,
the
response
for
me
to
do
so.
