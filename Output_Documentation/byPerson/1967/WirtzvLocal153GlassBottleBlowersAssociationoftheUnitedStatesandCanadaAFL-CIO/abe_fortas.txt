justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose,
mr.
claiborne,
in
one
point
of
view
which
you
are
saying
is
that
the
problem
--
you
know
the
complaint
here
is
the
existence
of
the
rule
confining
the
eligibility
to
stand
for
election
of
the
office.
if
that
rule
is
persisted
through
the
1965
election,
i
suppose
it
still
persists
the
board
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
is
really
the
problem
on
the
secretary's
complaint
and
if
that
something
will
happen
in
a
particular
election,
it
shows
the
election
was
fair
and
in
compliance
of
the
act
anyway
that
the
parties'
burden
is
on
the
parties
that
come
forward
but
it
seems
that
is
the
government
--
the
complaint
that
the
mere
fact
of
another
election
was
held
does
not
moot
the
controversy.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
particular
case,
was
it
removed
or
was
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
that
same
rule
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
the
secretary
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
however
that
may
be,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
the
second
election
evolved
the
proceeding
that
resulted
in
the
court's
determination
that
secretary's
suit
is
moot,
that
second
election
was
held
pursuant
to
the
same
rule
that
the
secretary
had
attacked
initially.
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
right?
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
yes,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
whether
the
rule
was
the
same.
