justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
be
ground
for
--
this
was
in
effect
an
ex
parte
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
would
you
contend
that
you
could
go
through
this
kind
of
procedure
prior
to
issuing
a
cease-and-desist
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
with
all
that
requires
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
you
concede
there
was
not
a
hearing
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
don't
need
on
that
approach?
you
really
don't
need
the
–
need
any
authority
over
wire
transmission,
do
you?
and
you
have
–
you'd
make
the
same
argument
you
have
no
authority
of
the
wire?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
you
don't
but
you
don't
need
two,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
on
the
--
on
the
other
hand,
would
you
claim
authority
over
this
--
over
catv
if
it
didn't
–
have
any
impact
at
all
on
your
broadcasting
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
wouldn't
be
doing
anything,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
really
must
reach
the
broadcasting
power
–
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
are
asked
to
find
what
you
do
and
it
doesn't
help
you
a
whole
lot
to
say
that
wire
story,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
three
commissions
rested
this
–
rested
flatly
in
its
opinion
on
the
wire
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
have
any
chenery
problem
here
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
excuse
me
a
minute.
what
if
a
licensed
station
owned
a
catv
cable
installation
for
the
purpose
of
extending
its
signals
say
into
san
diego
to
los
angeles,
if
you
say
this
–
this
case
operations
is
owned
by
the
license
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
commission
have
any
authority
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
why
could
this
if
tell
them
their
license
station
in
los
angeles
which
is
broadcasting
out
to
so
many
miles
normally,
why
couldn't
it
tell
that
station
that
it
could
not
have
a
cable
extension
into
san
diego?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
you
would
have
–
yeah,
they
have
jurisdiction
over
the
station
but
why
would
they
had
jurisdiction
over
that
part
of
that
station's
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
–
you've
say
that
the
commission
would
be
likewise
be
precluded
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--from
preventing
a
license
station
from
extending
its
signal
in
the
san
diego?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
made
the
commission
do
about
wire
communication?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
make
–
what
made
the
commission
do
about
wire
communication?
granted
that
this
catv
system
is
a
wire
carrier
or
as
transmitting
by
wire.
what
made
the
commission
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
they
do
anything
with
the
wire
communications
that
operation
which
is
necessary
to
carry
out
its
powers
over
radio
broadcast.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
the
commission
is
doing,
isn't?
it's
regulating
the
wire
carrier
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
effective
its
powers
over
broadcast?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
title
ii?
justice
byron
r.
white
iii?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
really
an
adjunct
to
their
exercising
there
explicit
power
you
say
as
an
adjunct
to
their
or
in
supplemental
to
their
title
iii
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
they
could
do
--
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
they
could
do
that
without
any
express
authority
over
wire
carriers.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
be
ground
for
--
this
was
in
effect
an
ex
parte
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
would
you
contend
that
you
could
go
through
this
kind
of
procedure
prior
to
issuing
a
cease-and-desist
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
with
all
that
requires
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
you
concede
there
was
not
a
hearing
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
don't
need
on
that
approach?
you
really
don't
need
the
–
need
any

do
you?
and
you
have
–
you'd

yes,

on

on
the

over

justice
byron

you
just

it?
justice
byron

and
so
you
really

justice

--
you
are
asked

a
