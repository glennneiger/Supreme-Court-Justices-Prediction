fortas
the
local
station.
what?
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
and
maybe
that
crippled
the
networks.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
--
what
do
you
require
in
this
local
service
business?
how
much
time
you
require
of
a
local
station?
does
that
devote
of
--
how
much
of
its
time
does
the
network
affiliate
have
to
devote
to
what
you
call
and
i
trust
not
whimsically
local
matters.
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
just
part
of
their
programming
that
they
submit
in
order
to
get
a
license?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how's
that
16%
broken
down?
justice
abe
fortas
40
%
local
news.
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
16%?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
includes
the
local
advertising?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
include
the
local
commercial
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it's
a
16%
segment
that
all
this
is
about
in
protecting
that?
justice
abe
fortas
do
we
have
before
us
--
we
don't
have
before
us
a
substance
of
these
regulations
anyway,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
your
power
to
do
them?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
those
are
subscriber
areas.
justice
abe
fortas
what
jurisdiction
do
you
exercise
over
the
cable
that
–
over
which
network
programs
are
distributed?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
do
that,
but
that's
not
my
question.
what
jurisdiction
do
you
exercise
over
the
cable
itself
–
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
is
made
for
the
cable
and
the
service
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
regulate
that
under
your
common
carrier
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
claim
any
authority
to
regulate
that
as
insularity
or
jurisdiction
over
broadcasting?
justice
abe
fortas
has
the
question
ever
arisen?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
see
a
distinction
between
your
power
derivative
from
your
broadcasting
jurisdiction
over
catv
on
the
one
hand
and
over
the
cable
service
on
the
other
hand?
i
realize
that
one
is
sort
of
in
the
retail
business
and
the
others
so
to
speak
in
the
wholesale
business,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
yes,
that's
right.
so,
you
can't
regulate
catv
under
your
common
carrier
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
unlike
that
it
talked
about
the
as
–
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
meaning
for
a
distinction
between
the
jurisdiction
that
you
claim
over
catv
and
the
cable
situation
with
respect
to
your
broadcasting
jurisdiction
and
its
implication?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
that
the
basis
really
of
your
claim
of
jurisdiction
over
catv
is
that
catv
operates
as
an
extension
of
particular
stations?
justice
abe
fortas
extension
of
their
service
area
and
in
that
way
and
i
think
your
allocation
power?
justice
abe
fortas
and
since
it
directly
affects
your
allocation
power
in
that
way
then
we
should
assume
--
we
should
determine
that
the
statute
authorizes
certain
–
some
regulation
of
catv.
is
that
not
the
basis
of
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
does
your
brief
state
just
what
you
think
is
a
nature
and
extent
of
your
jurisdiction,
i
forgot?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
from
way
you
drive
it,
but
what
you
think
you
can
do
with
respect
catv?
do
you
think
you
can
license
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
catv
system?
justice
abe
fortas
by
an
order
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
directed
to
them?
justice
abe
fortas
i
order
directed
to
the
catv.
justice
abe
fortas
you
couldn't
reach
that
by
a
rule
and
order
directed
to
the
stations
to
your
licensees.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
but
i
say
could
you
reach
the
catv
by
in
that
way?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
catv
can
–
does
that
without
a
permission
of
the
station?
justice
abe
fortas
then
how
do
you
say
--
how
do
you
say
that
the
catv
is
an
extension
of
the
service
area
of
the
station?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
some
a
movie
houses
decide
if
this
is
imaginable,
suppose
the
movie
houses
decide
that
they're
going
to
run
commercially
throughout
the
country
films,
that
were
first
reduced
in
sound
on
the
facilities
of
television
stations.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what's
the
--
how
do
you
distinguish
of
theoretically
except
as
a
matter
of
degree?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
but
that
--
that's
got
two
parts
to
it.
one
is,
what
is
--
what
constitutes
extending
the
service
area
of
station
that's
not
the
easy
one
for
me?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
didn't
understand
mr.
geller's
argument
quite
that
way.
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
he
was
arguing
sort
of
a
necessary
and
appropriate
power
that
is
to
say
that
implicit
in
the
other
parts
of
the
act
in
various
parts
of
the
act,
he
asks
this
court
to
find
a
power
to
the
commission
to
impose
certain
types
of
regulation
on
catv
as
necessary
and
incidental
to
the
explicit
powers
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
--
that
is
his
argument
there's
no
problem
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
but
as
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
the
governments'
argument
is
that
power
to
regulate
catv
is
found
squarely
with
and
not
by
implication.
justice
abe
fortas
but
they're
trying
to
get
out
on
it?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
on
the
ground
that
this
is
something
that
is
necessarily
incidental
to
the
exercise
of
its
powers
explicitly
vested
in
them?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
are
things
you
should
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
suppose
--
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
the
reason
why
congress
hasn't
legislated
on
the
subject?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
its
nothing
in
the
–
there
are
no
committee
reports
or
anything
in
the
sort
that
provide
the
basis
for
the
less
changing.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
geller
urges
as
i
understand
them
that
this
congress'
inaction
should
be
taken
as
acquiescence
and
what
the
commissions
were
not
to
in
this
field
and
that's
always
a
permissible
line
of
argument.
now,
i
wondered
if
you
had
the
state
your
view
as
to
the
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
congress
has
not
acted
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
--
in
other
words,
that
congress
is
different
about
legislating
in
this
field?
justice
abe
fortas
an
originate
program?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
had
a
little
while
then?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
quite
understand
that
because
as
i
understand
in
your
saying
that
there
is
explicit
authority
in
the
act
to
regulate
this
but
there
isn't?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
how?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
now
tell
–
justice
abe
fortas
now,
explain
to
me
just
how
catv
fits
with
that
definition?
justice
abe
fortas
between
the
points
of
origin?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
you
mean
by
origin
there,
you
must
mean
that
catv
pick
up?
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
if
there's
a
result
of
some
technological
development,
it
will
possible
to
have
a
50
or
60
additional
of
vhf
or
uhf
stations
there.
the
argument
would
be
that
the
commission
can
deny
license
and
perhaps
it's
been
indicated
on
the
grounds
that
would
be
excessive
competition?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
about
justice
abe
fortas
the
local
station.
what?
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
and
maybe
that
crippled
the
networks.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
--
what
do
you
require
in
this
local

business?
how
much
time
you
require

the
