mr.
geller,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
when
did
the
catv
first
out
an
impact
to
on
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scheiner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
here,
are
you
entirely
free
from
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
regulation
you
would
be
under
if
they
have
no
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
the
effect
--
the
effect
of
your
catv
though
is
–
goes
beyond
the
state
lines,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
as
i
--
as
i
understood
the
counsel
in
the
case
of
the
networks,
they
were
able
to
regulate
the
networks
through
regulation
of
the
local
--
of
the
local
stations.
now,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
way
that
there
could
be
regulation
over
the
end
of
your
--
your
possible
interference
with
the
allocation
programs
of
the
commission,
if
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
catv?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
by
anybody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
who
--
who
can
regulate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
suppose
there's
–
suppose
in
connecticut,
you
set
up
your
catv
and
it
interfered
with
the
program
in
new
york
and
new
jersey.
how
could
--
how
is
that
regulated
in
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
for
the
protection
of
the
areas
in
connecticut
or
is
that,
that
assume
to
be
for
the
protection
of
the
service
area
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
or
parts
of
pennsylvania
let
us
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
do
they
--
do
they
assume
to
protect
the
new
york
area
for
instance
or
are
there
--
is
there
a
function
to
protect
the
people
of
connecticut?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
secondary
function
if
they
have
to
protect
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
as
a
practical
matter
without
regard
to
what
power
the
commission
actually
had.
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
leave
the
commission
in
a
bad
situation
if
it
could
not
protect
new
york's
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
this
question
and
i
will
try
not
to
disturb
you
anymore,
but
without
--
without
regard
to
whether
congress
actually
did
leave
you
beyond
in
a
regulation
by
the
commission,
what
do
you
have
to
say
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
argument
of
counsel
that
--
that
such
power
is
essential
to
their
having
--
to
their
allocation
systems
that
they
--
that
they
have
and
not
--
if
unregulated
it
will
--
will
interfere
with
a
--with
their
programs
to
a
agreed
that
they
cannot
function
effectively?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
what
review
would
you
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
the
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
mr.
scheiner
just
one
more
question.
if
--
as
i
understood
you
in
the
san
diego
area,
you're
not
bringing
in
any
additional
service?
you're
–
you're
following
the
rules
of
the
regulation
whatever
they
might
be
of
the
commission?
now
would
your
argument
be
the
same,
if
it
were
not
that
way
and
if
you
were
bringing
in
some
other
part
of
the
country
something
it
would
interfere
with
the
--
with
the
allocation
programs
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
oh,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jennes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
that's
essentially
the
argument
here
but
as
i
understand
it
on
the
policy
side
or
whatever
one
might
want
to
call
it?

we'll

chief

may

may
i
ask
when
did
the

out
an

to
on
the

chief

i

chief

i

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scheiner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
here,
are
you
entirely
free
from
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
regulation
you
would
be
under
if
they
have
no
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
the
effect
--
the
effect
of
your
catv
though
is
–
goes
beyond
the
state
lines,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
as

of
the

over
the

your

your

if
they
did
not
have

over
catv?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
by
anybody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
who
--
who
can
regulate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
suppose
there's
–
suppose
in
connecticut,
you
set
up
your
catv
and
it
interfered
with
the
program
in
new
york
and
new
jersey.
how
could
--
how
is
that
regulated
in
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
for
the
protection
of
the
areas
in
connecticut
or
is
that,
that
assume
to
be
for
the
protection
of
the
service
area
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
or
parts
of
pennsylvania
let
us
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
do
they
--
do
they
assume
to
protect
the
new
york
area
for
instance
or
are
there
--
is
there
a
function
to
protect
the
people
of
connecticut?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
secondary

if
they

chief

well,
now
as

chief

--
chief

and
then
what

would
you
have?
chief

what
the

chief

may
