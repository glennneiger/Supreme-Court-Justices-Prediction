mr.
henry
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
impact
of
community
antenna
television
on
television
allocations
throughout
the
united
states
and
of
the
fcc's
jurisdiction
to
regulate
catv
in
order
to
preserve
local
television
service.
the
issues
in
the
case,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
catv
and
its
jurisdiction
to
inter
relief
order
involve
construction
of
the
communications
act
of
1934
but
the
background
facts
are
very
important
and
i
would
like
to
go
over
them
first.
now,
the
commission
and
the
congress
have
long
had
a
policy
of
local
television
service,
of
service
coming
from
local
sources
rather
emanating
from
just
a
few
large
metropolitan
areas.
the
commission,
therefore,
has
devised
a
nationwide
cable
of
tv
assignments,
assigning
channels
to
hundreds
of
communities
and
specifying
the
heights
and
powers
of
the
stations.
the
purpose
of
this
plan
is
to
get
local
service.
to
give
an
example
that
would
be
applicable
in
this
case,
the
commission
could
have
given
the
los
angeles
stations
a
heightened
power
that
was
so
great
that
they
will
put
a
very
good
signal
in
the
san
diego
even
though
it's
a
120
miles
away.
and
then
the
people
in
san
diego
will
get
a
great
deal
of
service
from
los
angeles
but
it
would
not
be
local
service.
it
would
not
be
service
geared
to
serving
the
needs
and
interests
of
san
diego,
its
ministers,
its
schools,
its
politicians,
its
issues.
so
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
specify
heightened
power
in
los
angeles
that
results
in
the
los
angeles'
signals
being
weak
when
they
arrive
in
san
diego,
so
that
you
can
have
san
diego
station.
and
this
is
not
just
the
commission
policy
but
i
say
this
is
a
congressional
policy
embodied
in
section
307
(b)
of
the
act.
and
now,
to
achieve
this
plan,
the
commission
has
made
use
of
12
vhf
channels,
the
channels
2
to
13
and
70
uhf
channels,
channels
14
through
83.
but
in
the
1958,
the
uhf
channels
run
into
difficulty
when
they
went
into
operation.
a
number
of
them
went
off
the
air,
the
stations,
people
were
not
buying
uhf
sets
and
entrepreneurs
were
not
entering
uhf
broadcasting.
the
congress
in
1962,
to
deal
with
this
situation
and
at
the
urging
of
the
commission,
passed
the
all
channel
television
receiver
law,
which
in
effect
specifies
that
all
sets
ship
and
interstate
commerce
shall
be
capable
of
receiving
uhf.
and
the
reason
why
congress
said
it
was
doing
this
is
that
it
had
to
make
uhf
viable.
it
was
the
only
way
to
get
this
nationwide
system
of
local
television
outlets
and
possibly
afford
the
network.
and
we
are
getting
the
benefits
of
that
law.
there
has
been
a
great
surge
in
interest
in
uhf.
stations
are
coming
on
the
air
particularly
in
the
major
markets
and
we
are
getting
the
additional
outlets
and
they
added
competition.
now,
what
this
case
is
all
about
really
is
the
impact
of
community
antenna
television
on
this
congressional
and
commission
plan
of
local
service.
and
it's
not
all
one
way.
catv
can
be
helpful.
it
can
bring
service
to
areas
that
do
stand
badly
in
the
need
of
it.
as
it
develop
originally,
the
catv
operator
would
go
out
to
a
--
put
a
tall
antenna
on
a
high
mountain,
get
the
signals
that
were
available
there.
very
often
local
signals
and
bring
them
down
in
the
community
that
was
in
the
valley
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
getting
any
service
or
they
will
go
out
pretty
far
away
from
the
town,
put
up
again
a
tall
antenna
and
get
the
signals,
amplify
them.
and
bring
them
back
to
a
town
that
was
just
too
far
away
from
a
major
population
center
and
as
a
result,
it
was
getting
maybe
only
one
or
two
signals.
and
the
commission
believes
that's
in
the
public
interest
and
it's
facilitated
that
with
microwave
brands.
when
it
looked
at
this
problem
in
1959,
for
the
first
time
it
found
that
catv
had
little
and
no
adverse
impact
in
the
public
interest.
but
when
it
looked
again
in
the
1960,
catv
began
undergoing
a
phenomenal
growth
pattern.
and
that
growth
pattern
began
to
threaten
the
entire
allocations
plan
of
local
service
and
raised
a
serious,
a
particularly
serious
threat
in
two
instances.
one
is
the
tv
station
serving
a
sparse
population
and
the
other
is
the
instance
of
the
new
uhf
stations
that
i
mentioned
that
are
going
on
the
air
in
these
major
markets.
now,
i
think
i
can
illustrate
the
problem
in
the
first
instance
by
a
specific
case,
a
case
called
carter
mountain
that
was
decided
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
in
carter
mountain,
you
had
a
station
in
riverton,
wyoming
serving
a
very
sparse
population
and
catv
assistance
begins
springing
up
throughout
its
service
area
and
these
systems
did
not
carry
the
local
station.
all
they
brought
in
was
a
service
from
denver,
colorado
hundreds
of
miles
away.
the
subscriber
set
to
get
his
service
of
his
cable
going
into
the
back
of
the
set
and
when
the
local
station
wasn't
on
that
cable,
it
was
cut
off
from
access
to
this
audience,
its
own
local
audience
and
that's
patently
destructive,
the
commission
found,
of
local
broadcasting.
there
was
a
second
factor
here
and
that
is
even
if
this
local
station
had
been
carried,
the
catv
system
was
duplicating
its
programs.
as
the
court
notes
from
the
case
to
follow,
catv
presently
stands
outside
the
competitive
tv
programming
distribution
market.
the
local
station
bids
for
its
programming
and
getting
exclusive.
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
communications
act
policy,
reasonable
exclusives
are
permissible.
the
catv
stands
outside
that
structure.
as
a
result,
if
the
local
station
is
presenting
bonanza,
let's
say
at
9:00,
the
catv
can
be
bringing
bonanza
in
from
denver
at
9:00
and
you're
cutting
the
audience
for
this
program
in
hafting.
an
audience
is
what
the
local
stations
sells,
to
get
revenues
from
advertisers
in
order
to
support
this
local
operation.
the
commission
found
that
if
catv
continues
to
grow
this
way
without
any
conditions,
it
would
mean
the
demise
of
this
local
station
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
holding
was
amply
justified
by
the
record.
the
commission
further
found
that
if
that
happened,
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
for
three
reasons.
catv
service
is
just
not
a
substitute
for
local
service
for
these
three
important
reasons.
first,
the
catv
does
not
serve
the
people
in
the
local
area.
it
cost
$3,000
to
$4,000
in
mile
to
string
cable
and
as
a
result,
it
doesn't
go
out
to
the
rural
areas.
it's
confined
just
to
the
built
up
areas
in
the
city.
in
carter
mountain,
this
meant
that
of
74,000
people,
40,000
of
them
would
be
left
without
any
service
and
that
clearly
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
for
some
people
to
get
service
at
the
expense
of
those
in
the
rural
areas
getting
none.
second,
catv
is
a
form
of
pay
tv
and
there
are
some
people
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
so
once
again
they
wouldn't
be
getting
service.
and
third
and
very
important,
it
is
not
local
service.
it's
always
been
brought
in
is
denver
signals
and
they
do
not
service
in
outlet
for
local
expression
for
riverton
and
so
you
would
have
a
complete
frustration
of
this
congressional
plan
of
local
service.
now,
to
deal
with
this
in
view
of
the
trends
as
phenomenal
growth
factor,
the
commission
devised
two
reasonable
rules:
the
first
is
that
the
local
station
be
carried
so
it
has
access
to
its
own
local
audience.
and
the
second
rule
--
mr.
henry
geller
that
the
local
station
be
carried,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
it
get
on
the
cable
so
that
it
has
access
to
its
own
local
audiences,
i
said.
the
second
is
the
same-day
non-duplication
rule
and
this
was
that
the
catv
system
affords
same-day
non-duplication
protection
to
the
programs
of
the
local
station.
as
the
court
probably
knows,
network
programming
is
distributed
on
a
fairly
simultaneous
nationwide
basis.
in
this
same-day
non-duplication
requirement
therefore
affords
a
great
deal
of
protection
to
the
network
programming
and
that's
a
very
important
basis
of
the
local
operation.
now,
these
--
i
should
point
out
that
this
allows
the
catv
to
continue
its
valuable
supplementary
service,
they
continue
to
bring
in
the
denver
signals
that
are
not
--
the
programming
is
not
there
already.
now,
these
rules
as
carried
in
non-duplication
rule
were
adopted
by
the
commission
after
a
lengthy
rule-making
proceeding
in
1965
in
a
report
called
the
first
report
and
they
are
made
applicable
at
that
time
to
microwave
service
systems.
our
jurisdiction
to
regulate
the
microwave
service
catv
system
is
not
challenged
here.
in
another
rule-making
proceeding,
culminated
in
1966
in
the
second
report,
we
made
the
same
carriage
in
non-duplication
rules
applicable
and
now
to
the
non-microwave
service
system,
the
so
called
“off-the-air
service
system”
and
of
course,
our
jurisdiction
to
do
that
is
being
challenged.
now,
the
second
prop
--
mr.
henry
geller
1966.
march
17th,
1966.
and
now,
the
second
problem
that
arose
is
i
say
concerned
the
new
uhf
stations
that
were
coming
on
the
air
in
these
major
markets.
catv
in
a
revolutionary
new
development
began
going
into
areas
that
were
unlike
riverton
these
areas
had
plenty
of
service:
baltimore,
philadelphia,
cleveland,
sacramento,
san
diego,
they
had
all
the
network
service.
and
what
catv
proposed
to
bring
in
to
these
areas
were
the
new
york
independence.
an
“independent”
is
a
station
that
is
not
affiliated
with
any
network.
they
would
propose
to
bring
in
the
three
new
york
independents
into
philadelphia
or
the
three
los
angeles
independents
into
sacramento
or
into
san
diego.
and
it
proposed
to
do
so
with
very
large
scale
operations:
12
channel
systems,
20
channel
systems
proposed
for
the
future,
$37
million
with
the
operation
proposed
in
philadelphia.
now,
coming
on
the
air,
in
the
same
major
markets
are
the
uhf
stations
and
they
are
going
to
be
independent
in
nature
also.
for
example,
there
are
three
uhf
stations
that
are
going
to
be
independent
on
the
air
now
in
philadelphia.
the
audience
for
this
non-network,
this
independent
programming
is
limited.
most
of
the
people
in
the
evening
hours
watch
network
programming
and
only
the
time
the
second
report
to
figure
was
only
10%
of
the
people
turned
away
from
the
popular
network
programming
to
watch
the
non-network
shows.
now,
without
catv
bringing
in
these
outside
signals,
the
local
uhf
stations
going
on
the
air
would
have
that
audience
to
themselves.
with
catv,
the
audience
is
being
fractionated.
it's
limited
and
it's
being
split
between
the
signals
coming
from
new
york
and
los
angeles
or
in
the
local
uhf
one.
and
the
question
--
mr.
henry
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
exactly.
they
would
be
fractionated.
it
gets
even
more
serious
than
that
because
even
when
you
bring
in
the
network
programming
station,
that
is
a
network
affiliated
station,
45%
of
its
programming
is
non-network
and
you
again
get
a
fractionalization
from
that.
and
the
question
before
the
commission
was
what
would
be
the
effect
to
fractionating
this
limited
audience
on
these
uhf
stations.
now,
the
commission
in
the
second
report
said
it
did
not
know
the
answer
because
the
answer
depended
upon
how
large
the
catv
systems
would
grow
in
these
major
markets.
but
it
did
hope
that
if
their
growth
was
of
a
higher
order
or
substantial
50%
or
more
that
they
would
cripple
uhf
and
that
the
commission
went
on
to
hold
that
that
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
henry
geller
the
network
programming,
the
same-day
non-duplication
requirement
works.
they're
had
afford
substantial
protection
and
so
there
is
not
a
problem
as
much
of
a
problem
in
that
area.
it's
with
the
independent,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
problem
really
becomes
a
queue.
mr.
henry
geller
the
commission
have
thought
this
was
a
most
serious
problem
for
--
because
again
what
you
have
here,
if
they
should
drive
uhf
stations
off
the
air,
this
independents,
would
be
that
philadelphia
would
be
getting
service
from
new
york
and
it
wouldn't
again
be
local
service.
you
would
have
the
television
structure
dominated
by
stations
--
mr.
henry
geller
there
is
no
specific
requirement
and
no
rigid
rule.
on
the
average,
your
honor,
the
figure
is
16%
per
network
affiliate
station.
mr.
henry
geller
and
to
get
renewed.
mr.
henry
geller
you
can
see
the
breakdown
of
it,
your
honor,
in
the
magazine,
television
magazine
in
august
of
1967
breaks
into
the
various
categories.
i
think
40%
of
it
was
news.
i
think
14%
would
--
mr.
henry
geller
of
the
local.
mr.
henry
geller
of
the
16%
was
news;
i
think
about
12%
was
entertainment.
i
think
about
5%
was
discussion.
i'm
relying
on
my
memory
and
i
would
refer
you
to
television
magazine
which
took
a
sample
and
broke
it
down.
mr.
henry
geller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
geller
oh!
no,
sir.
no,
we're
not
talking
about
the
programming
and
it
is
16%
but
it's
broken
to
various
categories.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
but
it's
extremely
important
segment.
we
do
want
the
politician
to
be
able
to
have
access
to
these
independent
stations
to
the
--
for
another
outlet
to
reach
the
people.
to
whatever
extent,
we
want
the
people
to
hear
discussion
of
controversial
issues.
the
sum
total
of
all
these
stations
for
example
in
philadelphia
before
the
three
vhfs
and
the
three
uhfs,
adds
up
to
informing
philadelphia
better
each
of
one
them,
and
we
don't
want
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
you
do
not
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
and
that
is
correct.
but
to
understand
--
we
believe
to
understand
both
issue
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
it
is
important
to
understand
the
basis
of
them.
now,
the
second
reason
--
mr.
henry
geller
you're
quite
right
on
that.
for
example,
in
this
community
wttg's
local
programming
is
30%.
it's
a
non-network
station
that
devotes
30%
of
its
time
and
you're
quite
right,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
is
a
very,
very
important
one
since
the
local
--
since
the
non-network
station
is
bound
to
devote
more
time
to
local
programming.
the
second,
the
commission
found
that
again,
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
because
catv
was
a
former
pay
tv
and
there
are
people
who
are
too
poor
in
these
ghettos
and
other
places
to
afford
it
so
that
some
people
would
not
be
getting
the
independent
service
at
all.
and
finally,
the
people
who
were
living
in
the
outlying
areas,
in
the
rural
areas,
surround
these
towns
like
sacramento
and
san
diego,
philadelphia,
they
also
would
not
be
getting
service,
the
independent
service,
because
the
catv
would
not
go
out.
now,
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
the
second
report,
the
commission
developed
its
major
market
policy
and
that
policy
states
that
in
the
top
100
markets
where
independent
uhf
television
was
most
likely
to
develop,
the
catv
system
which
propose
to
commence
operation
with
distant
signals,
that
signals
carried
beyond
their
grade
b
contour
which
is
normally
the
furthest
point
of
acceptable
service.
that
any
catv
proposing
to
begin
operation
with
such
signals
should
not
do
so
before
the
commission
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
had
established
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
with
uhf
broadcasting.
the
commission
felt
this
was
a
reasonable
way
to
proceed
because
it
was
trying
to
get
the
facts
in
depth
as
the
catv
penetration
and
other
factors
and
it
was
trying
to
get
them
before
it
was
too
late
before
the
catv
would
become
entrenched.
this
main
rule
is
in
1107
of
the
commission's
rules.
another
rule,
1109
is
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case.
the
commission
found
that
you
could
get
exactly
the
same
public
interest
question
raised
even
though
a
signal
was
not
being
carried
beyond
its
grade
b
contour
and
this
is
the
so-called
“area
of
overlapping
b
contours”.
and
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
best
by
baltimore,
washington.
the
washington
stations
place
a
grade
b
signal
over
baltimore.
but
they
are
not
watched
to
any
great
extent
in
baltimore.
people
in
baltimore
tend
to
watch
the
much
stronger
baltimore
signals.
but
if
you
have
a
catv
operating
in
baltimore
and
it
is
carrying
these
washington
signals,
it
makes
the
signals
exactly
the
same.
it
strengthens
them
and
now
there's
no
difference
at
all
technically
between
washington
and
baltimore.
so,
you
have
the
three
washington
independents
being
brought
into
baltimore
and
you
have
the
exactly
the
same
public
interest
question.
what's
the
effect
of
that
under
the
development
of
the
baltimore
uhf
station?
now,
the
commission
said
it
would
treat
this
problem
when
it
arose
under
petition,
bringing
it
to
its
attention
under
1109
and
would
hold
the
same
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
commencement
of
the
service.
now,
there
is
one
other
facet
of
1109
that's
applicable
here.
the
commission
grant
brought
it
in
all
the
existing
stations,
all
existing
systems,
excuse
me.
but
if
a
system
had
just
gotten
under
way
and
had
just
a
few
100
subscribers,
it
clearly
shouldn't
grow
from
these
few
hundred
to
hundreds
of
thousands
throughout
the
entire
community
until
there
had
been
a
resolution
of
the
same
public
interest
question.
and
so,
it
set
again
that
when
this
was
brought
to
its
attention
under
1109,
it
would
hold
the
hearing.
and
since
that
hearing
is
a
complex
economic
one
that
would
take
considerable
time,
the
commission
also
said
that
it
would
consider
on
the
pleadings
awarding
interim
relief,
holding
the
status
quo
because
if
the
systems
continue
to
grow
while
the
hearing
was
going
on,
the
commission
could
be
met
by
entrenchment
and
the
commission
stressed
throughout
all
these
rules
that
once
a
catv
becomes
entrenched,
it
cannot
roll
back
the
service.
it
cannot
let
the
service
get
dug
in.
the
people
get
to
rely
upon
it
and
then
try
to
yank
it
out
wires
and
all,
it's
just
not
practical.
now,
those
are
the
policies
that
are
involved
here
and
they
are
specifically
applicable
to
san
diego.
in
san
diego,
what
is
happening
is
that
from
a
120
miles
away,
the
los
angeles
signals
are
being
brought
in.
there
is
plenty
of
service
here
in
san
diego.
there
are
all
of
the
networks
on
vhf,
one
from
t1.
there
is
a
uhf
station
that's
independent
that's
gone
on
the
air.
there's
a
uhf
permittee
that
has
been
granted
and
it
has
not
yet
on
the
air.
there's
also
a
uhf
educational
station.
the
catv's
have
just
gotten
underway.
a
number
of
them,
some
of
them
begun
in
'63
but
the
penetration
is
very
small.
it
is
only
4.6%
of
the
homes
is
the
grade
a
area,
that
is
an
area
going
out
about
35
miles.
but
the
potential
for
catv
was
very
large.
it
was
78%
to
90%
of
the
homes
in
that
area
and
there
was
a
fairly
rapid
rate
to
growth.
so
that
the
commission
said
here
is
a
classic
case
for
the
application
of
our
major
market
policy.
they're
bringing
in
the
los
angeles
signals
that
aren't
viewed
any
great
extent
without
catv.
they,
therefore,
designated
the
matter
for
evidentiary
hearing
and
then
they
turned.
and
on
the
pleadings,
the
commission
turned
to
see
how
since
they
are
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing,
how
could
they
limit
the
growths.
and
looking
at
it,
the
commission
found
that
there
are
eight
discreet
islands
of
catv
activity.
mr.
henry
geller
eight
discreet
areas
or
islands
of
catv
activity.
the
catvs
in
san
diego
were
limited
to
specific
areas,
very
concrete
areas
and
the
commission
said:
“fine,
you
can
continue
to
grow
in
those
areas.
you
can
continue
to
access
subscribers”
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
“but
you
cannot
go
beyond
those
areas
with
los
angeles
signals.
you
can
continue
your
operation
with
los
angeles
signals
only
within
these
eight
areas.”
and
this
in
effect
allowed
the
commission
to
be
able
to
still
make
any
decision
they
wanted
to
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
because
it
prevented
the
kind
of
all-out
entrenchment,
all-out
growths
that
would
have
made
the
--
frustrated
the
very
purpose
of
the
hearing.
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
stressed,
“it
left
the
catv
systems
fully
viable.”
the
commission
here
is
the
largest
in
the
united
states
but
the
commission
also
said
if
a
wrong
in
the
viability
come
back
and
tell
us
and
we'll
modify
the
order.
but
it
was
a
reasonable
effort
to
hold
the
evidentiary
hearing,
at
the
same
time,
reasonably
accommodate
the
catv
systems.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
we
--
rather
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
there
was
a
full
pleadings.
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute
here
and
we
say
that
we
--
our
action
here
was
full
and
it
was
proper
on
the
pleadings.
and
at
page
147,
you
will
see
the
very
full
opportunity.
page
147
of
the
appendix.
mr.
henry
geller
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
henry
geller
no,
it
was
not
ex
parte.
it
was
served
upon
them
the
request
on
the
catv
systems.
they
responded
fully.
as
i
say
at
page
147,
you
see
all
the
pleadings.
it
was
not
done
with
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it
was
done
on
very
voluminous
written
pleadings
back
and
forth
which
did
not
put
any
issues
that
we
say
in
dispute.
all
the
crucial
elements
were
there.
the
service
coming
in
from
los
angeles
which
wasn't
viewed
very
much,
the
fact
of
uhf
activity,
the
fact
of
catv
had
just
gotten
underway
and
only
had
4.6
penetration
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
believe
that
in
the
cease-and-desist
field,
we
would
find
very
extraordinary
circum
--
mr.
henry
geller
the
cease-and-desist?
mr.
henry
geller
there
is
a
hearing
when
there
is
--
mr.
henry
geller
absolutely.
we
--
which
the
second
issue
in
the
case
contend
that
it
was
not
necessary.
we
were
not
engaged
in
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
henry
geller
the
interim
relief
order
which
the
commission
issued
preserving
the
status
quo
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
and
that
court
held
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
community
and
antenna
television,
relying
chiefly
on
opinion
of
this
court
in
regents
v.
carroll
and
that
brings
me
to
the
first
legal
issue
in
the
case,
our
jurisdiction
over
the
off
the
air
catv.
mr.
henry
geller
we
believe,
yes,
they
did
hold
that
that
they
we're
saying
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
a
non-licensee
catv
and
we
think
subsequent
cases,
the
valley
vision
case
particularly
has
borne
that
out.
there
was
no
question
of
an
interim
relief
order
in
valley
vision.
they
state
our
order
and
cited
only
the
southwestern
case
here.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
the
opinion
is
subject
to
construction.
although,
we
think
that
reading
it
–
we
read
it
a
saying
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
catv
when
it
relies
upon
carroll
to
say
that
we
cannot
extend
our
orders
to
a
non-licensee
and
that
would
not
just
be
interim
relief
order
because
there
would
also
be
rules.
and
as
i
say
in
a
subsequent
case
where
there
was
no
question
of
interim
relief
valley
vision,
the
court
state
our
order
and
made
clear
in
the
all
argument
judge
barnes
was
on
the
panel
that
they
felt
they
had
got
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
had
held
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
off
the
air
catv.
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
it
was
not
brought.
in
the
buckeye
case,
our
jurisdictional
position
was
fully
sustained.
we
believe
that
our
jurisdiction
stems
directly
from
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
act.
section
1
of
the
act
calls
for
the
establishment
of
--
as
efficient
and
nationwide
system
of
wire
and
radio
communication
as
possible
and
says
that
authority
is
being
centralized
in
the
fcc
to
achieve
that.
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
says
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
applicable
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire
and
radio
and
sections
4
(i)
and
303
give
us
broad
rule
making
powers
to
carry
out
the
provisions.
now,
catv
comes
within
the
provisions
because
it
is
an
interstate
communication
by
wire
within
the
definition
in
3
(a)
and
3
(e)
and
that
is
not
really
in
dispute
here.
it
also
comes
within
the
provisions
that
we
think
in
another
basis
that
it’s
a
--
it
comes
within
the
definition
in
3
(b)
of
radio
communication
because
it
is
an
instrumentality
incidental
to
the
transmission
of
energy
by
radio
and
the
definition
includes
that
too,
but
it
does
come
thus
within
two
way.
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
applicable
and
we
have
made
rules
to
carry
out
certain
provisions
and
the
provisions
which
we
are
carrying
out,
we
say,
are,
307
(b)
which
calls
for
this
nationwide
plan
of
local
television,
303
(h)
which
is
very
important
here
and
which
says
that
the
commission
can
establish
the
service
area
stations
so
as
to
achieve
that
nationwide
plan,
and
303
(s)
which
is
the
all
channel
law
which
calls
for
the
promotion
of
uhf,
again,
is
to
get
this
system
of
local
television.
and
what
--
it
is
that
the
catv
is
in
effect
extending
the
service
area
stations.
that
is
what
it
does
and
the
heart
of
our
position
is
that
since
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
applicable
to
it,
we
can
regulate
that
extension
of
the
service
area
by
catv
in
order
to
prevent
the
frustration
of
this
nationwide
plan
of
local
service.
now,
we
argue
that
our
action
therefore
comes
explicitly
within
the
terms
of
the
act,
but
it
also
we
urge,
comes
within
the
spirit
and
the
purpose
of
the
act.
as
this
court
said
in
pottsville,
the
very
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
fcc
was
to
keep
a
grip
on
this
dynamic
new
technology
that
changes
so
much
to
prevent
a
chaotic
allocation
situation
from
resulting
and
in
nbc,
the
court
said,
we
have
been
given
comprehensive
powers
to
achieve
that
purpose.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
there
are
two
dissenters
from
our
jurisdiction
out
of
the
seven
commissioners.
we
have
sought
clarifying
legislation.
we
sought
at
the
time
we
adopted
the
second
report.
we
believe
that
an
important
new
field
like
this,
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
congress
legislate
it.
there
has
been
no
legislation.
however,
we
argue
that
the
recent
legislative
history,
if
anything,
shows
acquiescence
when
you
examine
this
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
now
the
regents
v.
carroll
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
below,
we
are
just
inapplicable
here.
in
regents,
the
commission
as
a
condition
of
renewing
the
license
of
a
radio
station
specified
that
the
station
had
to
terminate
a
contract
it
had
with
an
outside
party
that
prevented
the
station
we
found
from
serving
the
public
interest
fully.
the
station
terminated
the
contract.
there
was
a
suit
in
the
state
court
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract
and
this
court
held
that
the
commission
could
not
adjudicate
the
state
court
matter,
the
issue
of
impossibility
of
performance
because
of
the
commission’s
action,
all
these
were
matters
for
the
state
court.
the
court
--
this
court
did
not
come
remotely
close
to
holding
in
that
case
so
that
that
the
commission
lacked
the
authority
to
carry
out
the
allocation
provisions
of
the
act
as
to
an
entity
coming
expressly
within
those
provisions,
catv,
which
is
extending
the
service
area
or
stations
in
a
way
that
can
frustrate
the
whole
allocations
plan.
the
main
argument
that
respondents
have
made
against
jurisdiction
is
that,
the
act
does
not
have
any
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
of
wire
communication.
it
has
some
provisions
they
say
like
605
but
in
the
main,
the
act
deals
in
title
ii
with
common
carrier
regulation,
and
in
title
iii
with
radio
regulations.
well,
we
would
agree
that
the
commission
does
not
have
plenary
jurisdiction
to
do
it,
everything
or
anything
it
wants
to
catv,
but
that
does
not
mean
we
lacked
jurisdiction
entirely.
what
we
have
is
the
jurisdiction
to
carry
out
the
pertinent
provisions
that
do
fit
that
are
pertinent
to
catv
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
here.
we
would
also
agree
that
the
congress
in
1934
no
more
thought
of
catv
than
it
thought
of
television.
they
couldn’t
foresee
developments
like
that.
what
they
did
was
to
give
us
a
broad
grand
of
authority
under
a
public
interest
standard,
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
is
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
mr.
henry
geller
we
regulate
the
networks
at
the
present
time
to
their
affiliates.
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
–
that's
common
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
this
common
carrier
jurisdiction.
we
regulate
the
rates
that
are
charged
in
networks.
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
we
have
regulated
the
common
carrier
aspects,
the
common
carrier
reserves
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
it
hasn't
your
honor
because
when
we
want
to
regulate
the
networks,
we
have
gone
in
two
ways
to
do
that.
one
way,
we
have
gone
is
to
make
regulations
applicable
to
their
affiliates
saying
that
we
will
not
renew
the
license
of
an
affiliate
which
engages
in
any
activity
we
consider
inconsistent.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
the
cable
that
serves
a
network
is
a
common
carrier.
it
will
serve
anybody
who
comes
along
and
we
have
held
and
all
the
parties
are
in
agreement
on
this,
said
the
catv
is
not
a
common
carrier.
it
does
not
take
messages
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
have
declined
to
do
it.
mr.
henry
geller
uh
mm.
mr.
henry
geller
by
cable,
you
mean
the
networks,
sir?
i
want
to
make
sure
–
mr.
henry
geller
--
because
on
the
network,
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
law
applicable
which
says
in
303
(i)
that
we
can
make
regulations
applicable
to
radio
stations
engaged
in
chain
broadcasting.
we
therefore
focus
on
that
when
we
act
in
the
network
field.
and
we
have
adopted
regulations
that
go
–
we
–
that
go
to
the
affiliate
and
we
are
now
proposing,
your
honor,
to
adopt
regulations
in
the
television
area
that
go
directly
to
the
network
television
licensee.
we
say,
they
are
radio
stations
engaged
in
chain
broadcasting
and
we
--
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
a
303
(i)
determines
what
we
do
in
this
area,
and
we
are
proposing
direct
regulation
of
the
television
network.
now,
that
is
being
disputed
by
them
and
eventually,
that's
a
different
issue
of
me
come
before
the
courts
and
have
to
be
settled.
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
says,
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
applicable
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire.
the
provisions
that
we
are
applying
are
303
(h)
and
307
(b)
which
call
for
these
plans
and
what
the
--
since
catv
is
extending
the
service
area
station,
we
say
we
can
make
those
provisions
applicable.
now,
an
argument
comes
back
that
the
provision
for
making
applicable
are
radio
provisions
and
we're
making
them
applicable
to
a
wire
system
and
that
there
is
a
rigid
dichotomy
here.
and
to
that
we
cite
section
1
of
the
act
that
says
that,
the
authorities
being
centralized
in
1
(h)
and
(c)
in
order
to
get
this
efficient
nationwide
system.
previous
to
the
1934
act,
the
icc
had
wire
and
the
federal
radio
commission
had
radio.
and
the
congress
said
in
the
reports
that
we've
cited
that,
there
is
a
need
for
a
unified
jurisdiction
here
for
one
comprehensive
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
industry.
and
that's
why
they
centralized
the
authority
in
the
commission
and
we
are
exercising
that
centralized
authority
over
both
wire
and
radio
in
order
to
achieve
this
efficient
nationwide
system
of
local
television
outlets,
but
that
is
a
statement
--
you're
correcting
your
statement
of
the
basis
upon
which
we
are
asserting
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
if
–
well,
what
we
do
save
point
to
though
is
we
have
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
that
says,
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
well,
it's
explicit.
i
think
the
congress
meant
to
say
that
we
want
you
to
have
the
unified
jurisdiction
over
wire
and
radio
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
would
have
jurisdiction
over
but
we
would
have
no
provisions
we'd
be
carrying
out.
there
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
henry
geller
that's
correct.
absolutely.
mr.
henry
geller
no,
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
it
doesn't
help
us
because
then
the
next
question
comes,
what
are
you
doing
to
carry
it
out?
what
provisions
are
you
carrying
it
out?
but
we
say
here
that
there
are
--
mr.
henry
geller
oh,
no,
your
honor.
we
start
with
that
but
you
then
have
to
go
--
we're
not
saying
that
we
could
regulate
them
just
because
there
are
wire
communications.
as
you
say,
we're
regulating
them
because
there
are
wire
communications
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
are
regulating
them
because
they
are
wire
communication
which
is
extending
the
service
area
stations
and
having
an
impact
on
the
nationwide
system
with
television
allocation
and
that
is
the
basis
that
we
are
doing
it.
now
the
chenery
problem
that
was
raised,
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of
was
it
we
did
bring
up
the
point
that
we
could
also
regulate
them
as
radio
communication
as
incidental
to
the
transmission
of
radio
communication.
we
don't
believe
there
is
chenery
point
there
either
because
this
is
a
legal
matter.
chenery
applied
when
–
as
to
policy.
if
the
agency
decided
to
act
on
one
policy
and
then
in
court
tried
to
shift,
in
chenery
said
you
couldn't
do
that.
but
we
have
enunciated
the
policy
in
the
major
market
in
the
carriage
of
non-duplication.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
legal
power
to
do
so
and
we
believe
we
do?
on
the
basis
that
they
are
interstate
communication
by
wire
which
is
affecting,
extending
the
service
area
and
affecting
the
plan
and
also
on
the
basis
that
they
are
radio
communication
coming
in
within
that
definition
also.
and
incidentally
we
did
note
in
our
memorandum
of
law,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
could
come
within
either
one
of
them,
either
3
(a)
or
3
(b),
either
in
the
state
communication
by
wire
or
the
radio.
we
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
resolve.
now
there
is
one
other
argument
made
in
here
in
jurisdiction
and
that
is
it
--
we
have
disclaimed
jurisdiction
previously.
in
1959,
when
we
considered
this
question,
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
pass
on
the
issue
whether
we
had
jurisdiction,
because
of
the
impact
on
broadcasting.
we
found
that
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
we
found
no
impact.
we
expressly
reserved
the
question
to
the
jurisdiction
on
that
basis
and
we
have
never
disclaimed
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
which
is
now
asserted
here
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
validity
of
our
interim
relief
order,
our
orders
that
specify
that
pending
the
outcome
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
respondents
could
not
expend
their
system
to
throughout
los
angels
–
throughout
san
diego
with
these
los
angles
signals
until
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
when
we
looked
that
it
1959,
we
found
no
impact.
we
think
the
impact
begin
coming
in
with
a
vengeance
in
the
early
1960's.
mr.
henry
geller
now
with
this
rapid
spurt
in
growth
and
there
was
a
revolutionary
new
change
where
it
began
going
in
to
the
--
the
major
markets.
mr.
henry
geller
and
there
were
a
lot
of
claims
of
impact
before,
but
when
held
the
hearings
we
could
not
prove
them
and
therefore
we
took
no
action.
mr.
henry
geller
about
1962.
that
was
a
beginning
of
it,
1962
and
1963,
but
it
--
it
began
accelerating
very
rapidly
after
that.
mr.
henry
geller
our
brief
states
fully
the
nature
of
our
jurisdiction
over
catv,
if
we
go
--
mr.
henry
geller
no.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
we
think
--
say
we
can
carry
out
the
allocation
provision
to
prevent
them
from
the
extending
a
service
area
in
such
a
way
is
direct
local
service.
mr.
henry
geller
we
think
--
mr.
henry
geller
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
henry
geller
by
rule
and
by
order.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
we
--
we
do
licenses
in
station
and
specify
what
it
could
conserve.
and
we
go
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
could
not.
mr.
henry
geller
because
the
catv
picks
up
the
signal,
moves
it
about
and
the
station
has
no
--
they
do
not
come
within
what
is
called
section
325
(a)
the
rebroadcast
prevision.
broadcast
stations
have
to
get
permission
to
pick
up
a
signal
and
rebroadcast
it.
the
catv
is
not
a
broadcast
station
so
it
just
picks
the
signal
up
and
moves
it
around.
the
station
couldn't
do
so,
it
couldn't
put
a
translator,
for
example.
mr.
henry
geller
it
does
this
without
permission.
mr.
henry
geller
because
in
--
in
practical
effect
it
is
extending
the
service
area.
it's
taking
the
service
area
of
the
station,
the
new
york
stations
and
moving
them
into
new
york.
now,
the
station
has
nothing
to
say
about
it,
but
the
effect
from
point
of
view
our
allocation
plan
is
the
same.
the
--
there
are
new
york
signals
being
carried,
perhaps
ups
to
50%
to
85%
of
all
our
homes
in
philadelphia
if
it's
allowed
to
grow
and
that
has
the
same
affect
as
if
it
the
stations
had
done.
and
we
are
looking
if
what
the
effect
is
saying
that
this
is
an
interstate
communication
by
wire
which
is
--
which
is
extending
that
service
area
and
if
possibly
ruining
the
new
competition,
we
want
in
philadelphia.
instead
of
getting
new
stations
in
philadelphia
that
could
be
the
basis
of
the
fourth
network,
well,
we're
getting
in
adjusting
new
york
signals
coming,
they
are
not
local.
mr.
henry
geller
there
will
be
no
problem
on
that.
we
would
not
--
mr.
henry
geller
because
the
--
that
happens
all
the
time,
both
the
movie
houses
and
--
and
the
tv
stations
are
competing
for
product?
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
--
what
we
say
is
what's
happening
here
it's
a
catv
is
taking
a
tv
signal
and
actually
extending
the
service
area
of
that
tv
signal
into
another
community
and
that
this
commission
was
created
to
control.
we
--
3038
says
if
this
commission
is
to
define
the
service
area
of
station
and
that
service
areas
suddenly
moved
from
new
york
in
the
philadelphia
and
we
--
to
the
detriment
of
our
--
of
the
public
interest
and
larger
more
effective
use
of
radio
and
we
say,
we
can
control
that.
we
have
to
be
able
to
control
it
and
that's
the
difference
between
them.
mr.
henry
geller
we
would
not
seek
to
regulated
in
any
way
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that.
we
--
we
don't
have
a
jurisdiction
over
bowling
alleys
and
movie
houses
anything
doing
what
--
they
are
extending
--
they
not
in
the
state
communication
by
wire
that
is
extending
the
service
area
stations.
that's
all
we've
claim
to
do.
we
carry
out
mr.
justice
fortas
other
provisions
to
the
act
that
we
haven't
gone
in
here
such
as
315
and
317.
mr.
henry
geller
but,
we
say
as
a
practical
matter
that's
what
are
they
do.
they
can
take
a
signal
from
new
york
into
washington.
now
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
our
position
is
that
the
--
that
respondents
really
are
ignoring
the
whole
basic
regulatory
scheme
here.
that
scheme
is
design
to
take
hold
of
this
situation
and
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
entrenchment,
that's
what
1107
does.
it's
says,
you
can't
move
new
york
signals
into
philadelphia
until
we
determine
that's
in
the
public
interest.
and
that's
precisely
what
1109
is
intended
to
do
here
also
and
it's
particularized
to
application;
it
says,
you
cannot
spread
los
angeles
signals
throughout
san
diego
until
we
will
resolve
that
question.
now,
we
could
have
adopted
a
blanket
rule
to
that
effect.
we
couldn't
adopted
the
rule
that
said
that
the
catv
system
which
is
operating
in
one
of
these
top
100
market
communities
and
which
has
very
low
penetration
and
bringing
in
a
signal
from
another
community
which
is
not
viewed
to
any
great
extent,
cannot
extend
its
--
its
operations
on
effective
date
of
our
rule
until
we
have
resolved
that
public
interest
question.
that
would
have
been
a
perfectly
reasonable
rule.
it
would
have
the
same
public
interest
basis
as
the
1107
rule.
it
should
not
have
catv
operations
going
through
out
a
community
that
can
effect
the
development
of
uhf
until
we
resolve
the
public
interest
question
and
as
i
said
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
believe
we
clearly
could
have
done
that.
mr.
henry
geller
oh,
yes.
i'm
assuming
now
to
--
mr.
henry
geller
i'm
assuming
your
honor
that
we
have
jurisdiction.
at
this
point,
we
are
all
assuming
we
have
jurisdiction
in
respondents
and
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
i
[laughter]
i
beg
your
pardon.
let
me
put
a
phrase
respondent
cited.
they
--
there
argument
is,
in
assuming
we
have
jurisdiction
over
catv
and
assuming
that
the
major
marker
policy
is
reasonable
and
even
assuming
at
the
end
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
we
could
order
roll
back
of
service,
they
say
we
cannot
issue
this
interim
relief
for
it.
and
i'm
saying
assuming
that
we
could
have
adopted
this
blanket
rule,
if
we
had
adopted
this
blanket
rule,
it
wouldn't
stopped
them
right
in
their
tracks
at
the
date
that
the
rule
became
effective.
instead
of
doing
that,
we
adopted
the
much
more
reasonable
procedure
of
1109
where
we
can
give
particularized
consideration
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
most
appropriate
relief
here?
in
san
diego
for
example,
the
pleading
showed
there
had
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
all
the
facets
to
the
major
market
question
were
there.
the
pleadings
also
showed
that
--
there
are
--
that
they
were
this
eight
islands
service,
eight
discreet
areas
and
that
is
not
in
dispute.
there
was
no
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
one
issue
in
dispute
and
we
resolved
that
in
favor
of
the
catv.
so
that
we
could
look
and
see
that
the
place
to
halt
this,
what
--
these
eight
discreet
areas
and
we
can
allow
them
to
grow
in
these
areas
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
the
all
out
expansion
that
would
frustrate
the
very
purpose
of
the
hearing.
mr.
henry
geller
by
a
man.
they
were
affidavits
attached
and
to
both
--
to
the
pleading
of
the
petitioner
showing
where
there
were,
these
affidavits
were
not
disputed
except
to
one
instance.
and
then
we
--
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
--
in
favor
to
san
diego.
mr.
henry
geller
there
are
different
parts
of
san
diego.
chula
vista
would
be
one
discreet
area
and
they
could
expand
in
there.
paauwee
would
be
another
and
they
are
--
they
were
various
areas
in
san
diego
where
they
could
continue
their
growth.
mr.
henry
geller
right.
mr.
henry
geller
and
what
respondents
argument
comes
down
to
we
are
argue
therefore
is
that,
he's
saying
we
can
approach
this
problem
by
a
rule
that
would
halt
and
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
the
outcome
of
the
hearing,
but
that
we
can't
do
it
by
the
more
flexible
approach
of
--
of
1109.
now,
we
could
have
adopted
that
rule.
we
agree
we
could
have,
but
our
position
here
is
that
under
chenery,
the
agency
has
the
discretion
to
proceed
by
way
of
ad
hoc
particularized
proceedings.
they
have
--
it
feels
that's
appropriate.
that
here
that
is
obviously
more
appropriate.
it's
fair
to
the
catv.
and
if
--
this
is
really
one
reasonable
overall
scheme
of
hearing
--
evidentiary
hearing
before
entrenchment
and
that
this
is
a
perfectly
proper
way,
1109,
of
carrying
out
that
scheme
and
one
that's
available
under
4
(i)
in
303
(r).
now,
they
argued
that
4
(i)
and
303
(r)
just
housekeeping
provisions,
that
you
can
adopt
rules.
well,
the
4
(j)
is
the
provision
that
allow
us
to
adopt
rules.
4
(i)
and
303
(r)
allow
the
commission
to
issue
rules,
orders,
and
other
actions
is
that
maybe
necessary
in
the
--
in
the
execution
of
its
functions.
and
this
court
has
in
storer
and
in
american
trucking
said
that,
these
were
--
these
provisions
mean
just
what
they
say.
they
are
broad
grants
of
authority
to
take
action
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
on
the
312
point.
it's
argued
there
are
actions
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
cease-and-desist
provisions.
312
is
applicable
when
the
commission
is
trying
to
halt
some
activity
as
a
legal
that
it
violates
the
rule
or
the
act.
if
we
hold
the
very
short
evidentiary
hearing
then,
determine
whether
is
a
fact
finding
one,
to
determine
whether
the
activity
is
a
legal
that
is
we
order
to
hold.
we
didn't
do
that
here.
we
were
not
concerned
with
finding
out
whether
any
activity
was
illegal.
we
did
not
order
any
halt
to
ongoing
activity.
what
were
are
concern
with
doing
here
is
formulating
the
standard
particularizing
the
application
of
the
major
market
policy
to
the
san
diego
area.
and
we
urge
that
we
can
do
so
under
chenery
by
this
ad
hoc
procedure
and
therefore,
the
existence
of
312,
no
more
bursars
proceeding
with
this
ad
hoc
waive
and
it
does
the
main
approach
of
1107.
if
we
have
jurisdiction,
this
court
finds
to
regulate
catv
and
the
major
market
policy
is
reasonable
and
there
is
no
showing
that
ti
is
not
then
we
urge
that
we
have
the
power
to
adopt
these
reasonable
ad
hoc
procedures
and
to
take
the
action
that
we
need
to
under
the
explicit
language
of
4
(i)
and
303
(r).
mr.
henry
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
impact
of
community
antenna
television
on
television
allocations
throughout
the
united
states
and
of
the
fcc's
jurisdiction
to
regulate
catv
in
order
to
preserve
local
television
service.
the
issues
in
the
case,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
catv
and
its
jurisdiction
to
inter
relief
order
involve
construction
of
the
communications
act
of
1934
but
the
background
facts
are
very
important
and
i
would
like
to
go
over
them
first.
now,
the
commission
and
the
congress
have
long
had
a
policy
of
local
television
service,
of
service
coming
from
local
sources
rather
emanating
from
just
a
few
large
metropolitan
areas.
the
commission,
therefore,
has
devised
a
nationwide
cable
of
tv
assignments,
assigning
channels
to
hundreds
of
communities
and
specifying
the
heights
and
powers
of
the
stations.
the
purpose
of
this
plan
is
to
get
local
service.
to
give
an
example
that
would
be
applicable
in
this
case,
the
commission
could
have
given
the
los
angeles
stations
a
heightened
power
that
was
so
great
that
they
will
put
a
very
good
signal
in
the
san
diego
even
though
it's
a
120
miles
away.
and
then
the
people
in
san
diego
will
get
a
great
deal
of
service
from
los
angeles
but
it
would
not
be
local
service.
it
would
not
be
service
geared
to
serving
the
needs
and
interests
of
san
diego,
its
ministers,
its
schools,
its
politicians,
its
issues.
so
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
specify
heightened
power
in
los
angeles
that
results
in
the
los
angeles'
signals
being
weak
when
they
arrive
in
san
diego,
so
that
you
can
have
san
diego
station.
and
this
is
not
just
the
commission
policy
but
i
say
this
is
a
congressional
policy
embodied
in
section
307
(b)
of
the
act.
and
now,
to
achieve
this
plan,
the
commission
has
made
use
of
12
vhf
channels,
the
channels
2
to
13
and
70
uhf
channels,
channels
14
through
83.
but
in
the
1958,
the
uhf
channels
run
into
difficulty
when
they
went
into
operation.
a
number
of
them
went
off
the
air,
the
stations,
people
were
not
buying
uhf
sets
and
entrepreneurs
were
not
entering
uhf
broadcasting.
the
congress
in
1962,
to
deal
with
this
situation
and
at
the
urging
of
the
commission,
passed
the
all
channel
television
receiver
law,
which
in
effect
specifies
that
all
sets
ship
and
interstate
commerce
shall
be
capable
of
receiving
uhf.
and
the
reason
why
congress
said
it
was
doing
this
is
that
it
had
to
make
uhf
viable.
it
was
the
only
way
to
get
this
nationwide
system
of
local
television
outlets
and
possibly
afford
the
network.
and
we
are
getting
the
benefits
of
that
law.
there
has
been
a
great
surge
in
interest
in
uhf.
stations
are
coming
on
the
air
particularly
in
the
major
markets
and
we
are
getting
the
additional
outlets
and
they
added
competition.
now,
what
this
case
is
all
about
really
is
the
impact
of
community
antenna
television
on
this
congressional
and
commission
plan
of
local
service.
and
it's
not
all
one
way.
catv
can
be
helpful.
it
can
bring
service
to
areas
that
do
stand
badly
in
the
need
of
it.
as
it
develop
originally,
the
catv
operator
would
go
out
to
a
--
put
a
tall
antenna
on
a
high
mountain,
get
the
signals
that
were
available
there.
very
often
local
signals
and
bring
them
down
in
the
community
that
was
in
the
valley
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
getting
any
service
or
they
will
go
out
pretty
far
away
from
the
town,
put
up
again
a
tall
antenna
and
get
the
signals,
amplify
them.
and
bring
them
back
to
a
town
that
was
just
too
far
away
from
a
major
population
center
and
as
a
result,
it
was
getting
maybe
only
one
or
two
signals.
and
the
commission
believes
that's
in
the
public
interest
and
it's
facilitated
that
with
microwave
brands.
when
it
looked
at
this
problem
in
1959,
for
the
first
time
it
found
that
catv
had
little
and
no
adverse
impact
in
the
public
interest.
but
when
it
looked
again
in
the
1960,
catv
began
undergoing
a
phenomenal
growth
pattern.
and
that
growth
pattern
began
to
threaten
the
entire
allocations
plan
of
local
service
and
raised
a
serious,
a
particularly
serious
threat
in
two
instances.
one
is
the
tv
station
serving
a
sparse
population
and
the
other
is
the
instance
of
the
new
uhf
stations
that
i
mentioned
that
are
going
on
the
air
in
these
major
markets.
now,
i
think
i
can
illustrate
the
problem
in
the
first
instance
by
a
specific
case,
a
case
called
carter
mountain
that
was
decided
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
in
carter
mountain,
you
had
a
station
in
riverton,
wyoming
serving
a
very
sparse
population
and
catv
assistance
begins
springing
up
throughout
its
service
area
and
these
systems
did
not
carry
the
local
station.
all
they
brought
in
was
a
service
from
denver,
colorado
hundreds
of
miles
away.
the
subscriber
set
to
get
his
service
of
his
cable
going
into
the
back
of
the
set
and
when
the
local
station
wasn't
on
that
cable,
it
was
cut
off
from
access
to
this
audience,
its
own
local
audience
and
that's
patently
destructive,
the
commission
found,
of
local
broadcasting.
there
was
a
second
factor
here
and
that
is
even
if
this
local
station
had
been
carried,
the
catv
system
was
duplicating
its
programs.
as
the
court
notes
from
the
case
to
follow,
catv
presently
stands
outside
the
competitive
tv
programming
distribution
market.
the
local
station
bids
for
its
programming
and
getting
exclusive.
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
communications
act
policy,
reasonable
exclusives
are
permissible.
the
catv
stands
outside
that
structure.
as
a
result,
if
the
local
station
is
presenting
bonanza,
let's
say
at
9:00,
the
catv
can
be
bringing
bonanza
in
from
denver
at
9:00
and
you're
cutting
the
audience
for
this
program
in
hafting.
an
audience
is
what
the
local
stations
sells,
to
get
revenues
from
advertisers
in
order
to
support
this
local
operation.
the
commission
found
that
if
catv
continues
to
grow
this
way
without
any
conditions,
it
would
mean
the
demise
of
this
local
station
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
holding
was
amply
justified
by
the
record.
the
commission
further
found
that
if
that
happened,
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
for
three
reasons.
catv
service
is
just
not
a
substitute
for
local
service
for
these
three
important
reasons.
first,
the
catv
does
not
serve
the
people
in
the
local
area.
it
cost
$3,000
to
$4,000
in
mile
to
string
cable
and
as
a
result,
it
doesn't
go
out
to
the
rural
areas.
it's
confined
just
to
the
built
up
areas
in
the
city.
in
carter
mountain,
this
meant
that
of
74,000
people,
40,000
of
them
would
be
left
without
any
service
and
that
clearly
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
for
some
people
to
get
service
at
the
expense
of
those
in
the
rural
areas
getting
none.
second,
catv
is
a
form
of
pay
tv
and
there
are
some
people
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
so
once
again
they
wouldn't
be
getting
service.
and
third
and
very
important,
it
is
not
local
service.
it's
always
been
brought
in
is
denver
signals
and
they
do
not
service
in
outlet
for
local
expression
for
riverton
and
so
you
would
have
a
complete
frustration
of
this
congressional
plan
of
local
service.
now,
to
deal
with
this
in
view
of
the
trends
as
phenomenal
growth
factor,
the
commission
devised
two
reasonable
rules:
the
first
is
that
the
local
station
be
carried
so
it
has
access
to
its
own
local
audience.
and
the
second
rule
--
mr.
henry
geller
that
the
local
station
be
carried,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
it
get
on
the
cable
so
that
it
has
access
to
its
own
local
audiences,
i
said.
the
second
is
the
same-day
non-duplication
rule
and
this
was
that
the
catv
system
affords
same-day
non-duplication
protection
to
the
programs
of
the
local
station.
as
the
court
probably
knows,
network
programming
is
distributed
on
a
fairly
simultaneous
nationwide
basis.
in
this
same-day
non-duplication
requirement
therefore
affords
a
great
deal
of
protection
to
the
network
programming
and
that's
a
very
important
basis
of
the
local
operation.
now,
these
--
i
should
point
out
that
this
allows
the
catv
to
continue
its
valuable
supplementary
service,
they
continue
to
bring
in
the
denver
signals
that
are
not
--
the
programming
is
not
there
already.
now,
these
rules
as
carried
in
non-duplication
rule
were
adopted
by
the
commission
after
a
lengthy
rule-making
proceeding
in
1965
in
a
report
called
the
first
report
and
they
are
made
applicable
at
that
time
to
microwave
service
systems.
our
jurisdiction
to
regulate
the
microwave
service
catv
system
is
not
challenged
here.
in
another
rule-making
proceeding,
culminated
in
1966
in
the
second
report,
we
made
the
same
carriage
in
non-duplication
rules
applicable
and
now
to
the
non-microwave
service
system,
the
so
called
“off-the-air
service
system”
and
of
course,
our
jurisdiction
to
do
that
is
being
challenged.
now,
the
second
prop
--
mr.
henry
geller
1966.
march
17th,
1966.
and
now,
the
second
problem
that
arose
is
i
say
concerned
the
new
uhf
stations
that
were
coming
on
the
air
in
these
major
markets.
catv
in
a
revolutionary
new
development
began
going
into
areas
that
were
unlike
riverton
these
areas
had
plenty
of
service:
baltimore,
philadelphia,
cleveland,
sacramento,
san
diego,
they
had
all
the
network
service.
and
what
catv
proposed
to
bring
in
to
these
areas
were
the
new
york
independence.
an
“independent”
is
a
station
that
is
not
affiliated
with
any
network.
they
would
propose
to
bring
in
the
three
new
york
independents
into
philadelphia
or
the
three
los
angeles
independents
into
sacramento
or
into
san
diego.
and
it
proposed
to
do
so
with
very
large
scale
operations:
12
channel
systems,
20
channel
systems
proposed
for
the
future,
$37
million
with
the
operation
proposed
in
philadelphia.
now,
coming
on
the
air,
in
the
same
major
markets
are
the
uhf
stations
and
they
are
going
to
be
independent
in
nature
also.
for
example,
there
are
three
uhf
stations
that
are
going
to
be
independent
on
the
air
now
in
philadelphia.
the
audience
for
this
non-network,
this
independent
programming
is
limited.
most
of
the
people
in
the
evening
hours
watch
network
programming
and
only
the
time
the
second
report
to
figure
was
only
10%
of
the
people
turned
away
from
the
popular
network
programming
to
watch
the
non-network
shows.
now,
without
catv
bringing
in
these
outside
signals,
the
local
uhf
stations
going
on
the
air
would
have
that
audience
to
themselves.
with
catv,
the
audience
is
being
fractionated.
it's
limited
and
it's
being
split
between
the
signals
coming
from
new
york
and
los
angeles
or
in
the
local
uhf
one.
and
the
question
--
mr.
henry
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
exactly.
they
would
be
fractionated.
it
gets
even
more
serious
than
that
because
even
when
you
bring
in
the
network
programming
station,
that
is
a
network
affiliated
station,
45%
of
its
programming
is
non-network
and
you
again
get
a
fractionalization
from
that.
and
the
question
before
the
commission
was
what
would
be
the
effect
to
fractionating
this
limited
audience
on
these
uhf
stations.
now,
the
commission
in
the
second
report
said
it
did
not
know
the
answer
because
the
answer
depended
upon
how
large
the
catv
systems
would
grow
in
these
major
markets.
but
it
did
hope
that
if
their
growth
was
of
a
higher
order
or
substantial
50%
or
more
that
they
would
cripple
uhf
and
that
the
commission
went
on
to
hold
that
that
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
henry
geller
the
network
programming,
the
same-day
non-duplication
requirement
works.
they're
had
afford
substantial
protection
and
so
there
is
not
a
problem
as
much
of
a
problem
in
that
area.
it's
with
the
independent,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
problem
really
becomes
a
queue.
mr.
henry
geller
the
commission
have
thought
this
was
a
most
serious
problem
for
--
because
again
what
you
have
here,
if
they
should
drive
uhf
stations
off
the
air,
this
independents,
would
be
that
philadelphia
would
be
getting
service
from
new
york
and
it
wouldn't
again
be
local
service.
you
would
have
the
television
structure
dominated
by
stations
--
mr.
henry
geller
there
is
no
specific
requirement
and
no
rigid
rule.
on
the
average,
your
honor,
the
figure
is
16%
per
network
affiliate
station.
mr.
henry
geller
and
to
get
renewed.
mr.
henry
geller
you
can
see
the
breakdown
of
it,
your
honor,
in
the
magazine,
television
magazine
in
august
of
1967
breaks
into
the
various
categories.
i
think
40%
of
it
was
news.
i
think
14%
would
--
mr.
henry
geller
of
the
local.
mr.
henry
geller
of
the
16%
was
news;
i
think
about
12%
was
entertainment.
i
think
about
5%
was
discussion.
i'm
relying
on
my
memory
and
i
would
refer
you
to
television
magazine
which
took
a
sample
and
broke
it
down.
mr.
henry
geller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
geller
oh!
no,
sir.
no,
we're
not
talking
about
the
programming
and
it
is
16%
but
it's
broken
to
various
categories.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
but
it's
extremely
important
segment.
we
do
want
the
politician
to
be
able
to
have
access
to
these
independent
stations
to
the
--
for
another
outlet
to
reach
the
people.
to
whatever
extent,
we
want
the
people
to
hear
discussion
of
controversial
issues.
the
sum
total
of
all
these
stations
for
example
in
philadelphia
before
the
three
vhfs
and
the
three
uhfs,
adds
up
to
informing
philadelphia
better
each
of
one
them,
and
we
don't
want
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
you
do
not
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
and
that
is
correct.
but
to
understand
--
we
believe
to
understand
both
issue
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
it
is
important
to
understand
the
basis
of
them.
now,
the
second
reason
--
mr.
henry
geller
you're
quite
right
on
that.
for
example,
in
this
community
wttg's
local
programming
is
30%.
it's
a
non-network
station
that
devotes
30%
of
its
time
and
you're
quite
right,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
is
a
very,
very
important
one
since
the
local
--
since
the
non-network
station
is
bound
to
devote
more
time
to
local
programming.
the
second,
the
commission
found
that
again,
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
because
catv
was
a
former
pay
tv
and
there
are
people
who
are
too
poor
in
these
ghettos
and
other
places
to
afford
it
so
that
some
people
would
not
be
getting
the
independent
service
at
all.
and
finally,
the
people
who
were
living
in
the
outlying
areas,
in
the
rural
areas,
surround
these
towns
like
sacramento
and
san
diego,
philadelphia,
they
also
would
not
be
getting
service,
the
independent
service,
because
the
catv
would
not
go
out.
now,
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
the
second
report,
the
commission
developed
its
major
market
policy
and
that
policy
states
that
in
the
top
100
markets
where
independent
uhf
television
was
most
likely
to
develop,
the
catv
system
which
propose
to
commence
operation
with
distant
signals,
that
signals
carried
beyond
their
grade
b
contour
which
is
normally
the
furthest
point
of
acceptable
service.
that
any
catv
proposing
to
begin
operation
with
such
signals
should
not
do
so
before
the
commission
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
had
established
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
with
uhf
broadcasting.
the
commission
felt
this
was
a
reasonable
way
to
proceed
because
it
was
trying
to
get
the
facts
in
depth
as
the
catv
penetration
and
other
factors
and
it
was
trying
to
get
them
before
it
was
too
late
before
the
catv
would
become
entrenched.
this
main
rule
is
in
1107
of
the
commission's
rules.
another
rule,
1109
is
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case.
the
commission
found
that
you
could
get
exactly
the
same
public
interest
question
raised
even
though
a
signal
was
not
being
carried
beyond
its
grade
b
contour
and
this
is
the
so-called
“area
of
overlapping
b
contours”.
and
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
best
by
baltimore,
washington.
the
washington
stations
place
a
grade
b
signal
over
baltimore.
but
they
are
not
watched
to
any
great
extent
in
baltimore.
people
in
baltimore
tend
to
watch
the
much
stronger
baltimore
signals.
but
if
you
have
a
catv
operating
in
baltimore
and
it
is
carrying
these
washington
signals,
it
makes
the
signals
exactly
the
same.
it
strengthens
them
and
now
there's
no
difference
at
all
technically
between
washington
and
baltimore.
so,
you
have
the
three
washington
independents
being
brought
into
baltimore
and
you
have
the
exactly
the
same
public
interest
question.
what's
the
effect
of
that
under
the
development
of
the
baltimore
uhf
station?
now,
the
commission
said
it
would
treat
this
problem
when
it
arose
under
petition,
bringing
it
to
its
attention
under
1109
and
would
hold
the
same
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
commencement
of
the
service.
now,
there
is
one
other
facet
of
1109
that's
applicable
here.
the
commission
grant
brought
it
in
all
the
existing
stations,
all
existing
systems,
excuse
me.
but
if
a
system
had
just
gotten
under
way
and
had
just
a
few
100
subscribers,
it
clearly
shouldn't
grow
from
these
few
hundred
to
hundreds
of
thousands
throughout
the
entire
community
until
there
had
been
a
resolution
of
the
same
public
interest
question.
and
so,
it
set
again
that
when
this
was
brought
to
its
attention
under
1109,
it
would
hold
the
hearing.
and
since
that
hearing
is
a
complex
economic
one
that
would
take
considerable
time,
the
commission
also
said
that
it
would
consider
on
the
pleadings
awarding
interim
relief,
holding
the
status
quo
because
if
the
systems
continue
to
grow
while
the
hearing
was
going
on,
the
commission
could
be
met
by
entrenchment
and
the
commission
stressed
throughout
all
these
rules
that
once
a
catv
becomes
entrenched,
it
cannot
roll
back
the
service.
it
cannot
let
the
service
get
dug
in.
the
people
get
to
rely
upon
it
and
then
try
to
yank
it
out
wires
and
all,
it's
just
not
practical.
now,
those
are
the
policies
that
are
involved
here
and
they
are
specifically
applicable
to
san
diego.
in
san
diego,
what
is
happening
is
that
from
a
120
miles
away,
the
los
angeles
signals
are
being
brought
in.
there
is
plenty
of
service
here
in
san
diego.
there
are
all
of
the
networks
on
vhf,
one
from
t1.
there
is
a
uhf
station
that's
independent
that's
gone
on
the
air.
there's
a
uhf
permittee
that
has
been
granted
and
it
has
not
yet
on
the
air.
there's
also
a
uhf
educational
station.
the
catv's
have
just
gotten
underway.
a
number
of
them,
some
of
them
begun
in
'63
but
the
penetration
is
very
small.
it
is
only
4.6%
of
the
homes
is
the
grade
a
area,
that
is
an
area
going
out
about
35
miles.
but
the
potential
for
catv
was
very
large.
it
was
78%
to
90%
of
the
homes
in
that
area
and
there
was
a
fairly
rapid
rate
to
growth.
so
that
the
commission
said
here
is
a
classic
case
for
the
application
of
our
major
market
policy.
they're
bringing
in
the
los
angeles
signals
that
aren't
viewed
any
great
extent
without
catv.
they,
therefore,
designated
the
matter
for
evidentiary
hearing
and
then
they
turned.
and
on
the
pleadings,
the
commission
turned
to
see
how
since
they
are
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing,
how
could
they
limit
the
growths.
and
looking
at
it,
the
commission
found
that
there
are
eight
discreet
islands
of
catv
activity.
mr.
henry
geller
eight
discreet
areas
or
islands
of
catv
activity.
the
catvs
in
san
diego
were
limited
to
specific
areas,
very
concrete
areas
and
the
commission
said:
“fine,
you
can
continue
to
grow
in
those
areas.
you
can
continue
to
access
subscribers”
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
“but
you
cannot
go
beyond
those
areas
with
los
angeles
signals.
you
can
continue
your
operation
with
los
angeles
signals
only
within
these
eight
areas.”
and
this
in
effect
allowed
the
commission
to
be
able
to
still
make
any
decision
they
wanted
to
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
because
it
prevented
the
kind
of
all-out
entrenchment,
all-out
growths
that
would
have
made
the
--
frustrated
the
very
purpose
of
the
hearing.
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
stressed,
“it
left
the
catv
systems
fully
viable.”
the
commission
here
is
the
largest
in
the
united
states
but
the
commission
also
said
if
a
wrong
in
the
viability
come
back
and
tell
us
and
we'll
modify
the
order.
but
it
was
a
reasonable
effort
to
hold
the
evidentiary
hearing,
at
the
same
time,
reasonably
accommodate
the
catv
systems.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
we
--
rather
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
there
was
a
full
pleadings.
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute
here
and
we
say
that
we
--
our
action
here
was
full
and
it
was
proper
on
the
pleadings.
and
at
page
147,
you
will
see
the
very
full
opportunity.
page
147
of
the
appendix.
mr.
henry
geller
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
henry
geller
no,
it
was
not
ex
parte.
it
was
served
upon
them
the
request
on
the
catv
systems.
they
responded
fully.
as
i
say
at
page
147,
you
see
all
the
pleadings.
it
was
not
done
with
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it
was
done
on
very
voluminous
written
pleadings
back
and
forth
which
did
not
put
any
issues
that
we
say
in
dispute.
all
the
crucial
elements
were
there.
the
service
coming
in
from
los
angeles
which
wasn't
viewed
very
much,
the
fact
of
uhf
activity,
the
fact
of
catv
had
just
gotten
underway
and
only
had
4.6
penetration
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
believe
that
in
the
cease-and-desist
field,
we
would
find
very
extraordinary
circum
--
mr.
henry
geller
the
cease-and-desist?
mr.
henry
geller
there
is
a
hearing
when
there
is
--
mr.
henry
geller
absolutely.
we
--
which
the
second
issue
in
the
case
contend
that
it
was
not
necessary.
we
were
not
engaged
in
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
henry
geller
the
interim
relief
order
which
the
commission
issued
preserving
the
status
quo
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
and
that
court
held
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
community
and
antenna
television,
relying
chiefly
on
opinion
of
this
court
in
regents
v.
carroll
and
that
brings
me
to
the
first
legal
issue
in
the
case,
our
jurisdiction
over
the
off
the
air
catv.
mr.
henry
geller
we
believe,
yes,
they
did
hold
that
that
they
we're
saying
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
a
non-licensee
catv
and
we
think
subsequent
cases,
the
valley
vision
case
particularly
has
borne
that
out.
there
was
no
question
of
an
interim
relief
order
in
valley
vision.
they
state
our
order
and
cited
only
the
southwestern
case
here.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
the
opinion
is
subject
to
construction.
although,
we
think
that
reading
it
–
we
read
it
a
saying
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
catv
when
it
relies
upon
carroll
to
say
that
we
cannot
extend
our
orders
to
a
non-licensee
and
that
would
not
just
be
interim
relief
order
because
there
would
also
be
rules.
and
as
i
say
in
a
subsequent
case
where
there
was
no
question
of
interim
relief
valley
vision,
the
court
state
our
order
and
made
clear
in
the
all
argument
judge
barnes
was
on
the
panel
that
they
felt
they
had
got
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
had
held
that
we
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
off
the
air
catv.
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
it
was
not
brought.
in
the
buckeye
case,
our
jurisdictional
position
was
fully
sustained.
we
believe
that
our
jurisdiction
stems
directly
from
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
act.
section
1
of
the
act
calls
for
the
establishment
of
--
as
efficient
and
nationwide
system
of
wire
and
radio
communication
as
possible
and
says
that
authority
is
being
centralized
in
the
fcc
to
achieve
that.
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
says
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
applicable
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire
and
radio
and
sections
4
(i)
and
303
give
us
broad
rule
making
powers
to
carry
out
the
provisions.
now,
catv
comes
within
the
provisions
because
it
is
an
interstate
communication
by
wire
within
the
definition
in
3
(a)
and
3
(e)
and
that
is
not
really
in
dispute
here.
it
also
comes
within
the
provisions
that
we
think
in
another
basis
that
it’s
a
--
it
comes
within
the
definition
in
3
(b)
of
radio
communication
because
it
is
an
instrumentality
incidental
to
the
transmission
of
energy
by
radio
and
the
definition
includes
that
too,
but
it
does
come
thus
within
two
way.
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
applicable
and
we
have
made
rules
to
carry
out
certain
provisions
and
the
provisions
which
we
are
carrying
out,
we
say,
are,
307
(b)
which
calls
for
this
nationwide
plan
of
local
television,
303
(h)
which
is
very
important
here
and
which
says
that
the
commission
can
establish
the
service
area
stations
so
as
to
achieve
that
nationwide
plan,
and
303
(s)
which
is
the
all
channel
law
which
calls
for
the
promotion
of
uhf,
again,
is
to
get
this
system
of
local
television.
and
what
--
it
is
that
the
catv
is
in
effect
extending
the
service
area
stations.
that
is
what
it
does
and
the
heart
of
our
position
is
that
since
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
applicable
to
it,
we
can
regulate
that
extension
of
the
service
area
by
catv
in
order
to
prevent
the
frustration
of
this
nationwide
plan
of
local
service.
now,
we
argue
that
our
action
therefore
comes
explicitly
within
the
terms
of
the
act,
but
it
also
we
urge,
comes
within
the
spirit
and
the
purpose
of
the
act.
as
this
court
said
in
pottsville,
the
very
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
fcc
was
to
keep
a
grip
on
this
dynamic
new
technology
that
changes
so
much
to
prevent
a
chaotic
allocation
situation
from
resulting
and
in
nbc,
the
court
said,
we
have
been
given
comprehensive
powers
to
achieve
that
purpose.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
there
are
two
dissenters
from
our
jurisdiction
out
of
the
seven
commissioners.
we
have
sought
clarifying
legislation.
we
sought
at
the
time
we
adopted
the
second
report.
we
believe
that
an
important
new
field
like
this,
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
congress
legislate
it.
there
has
been
no
legislation.
however,
we
argue
that
the
recent
legislative
history,
if
anything,
shows
acquiescence
when
you
examine
this
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
now
the
regents
v.
carroll
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
below,
we
are
just
inapplicable
here.
in
regents,
the
commission
as
a
condition
of
renewing
the
license
of
a
radio
station
specified
that
the
station
had
to
terminate
a
contract
it
had
with
an
outside
party
that
prevented
the
station
we
found
from
serving
the
public
interest
fully.
the
station
terminated
the
contract.
there
was
a
suit
in
the
state
court
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract
and
this
court
held
that
the
commission
could
not
adjudicate
the
state
court
matter,
the
issue
of
impossibility
of
performance
because
of
the
commission’s
action,
all
these
were
matters
for
the
state
court.
the
court
--
this
court
did
not
come
remotely
close
to
holding
in
that
case
so
that
that
the
commission
lacked
the
authority
to
carry
out
the
allocation
provisions
of
the
act
as
to
an
entity
coming
expressly
within
those
provisions,
catv,
which
is
extending
the
service
area
or
stations
in
a
way
that
can
frustrate
the
whole
allocations
plan.
the
main
argument
that
respondents
have
made
against
jurisdiction
is
that,
the
act
does
not
have
any
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
of
wire
communication.
it
has
some
provisions
they
say
like
605
but
in
the
main,
the
act
deals
in
title
ii
with
common
carrier
regulation,
and
in
title
iii
with
radio
regulations.
well,
we
would
agree
that
the
commission
does
not
have
plenary
jurisdiction
to
do
it,
everything
or
anything
it
wants
to
catv,
but
that
does
not
mean
we
lacked
jurisdiction
entirely.
what
we
have
is
the
jurisdiction
to
carry
out
the
pertinent
provisions
that
do
fit
that
are
pertinent
to
catv
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
here.
we
would
also
agree
that
the
congress
in
1934
no
more
thought
of
catv
than
it
thought
of
television.
they
couldn’t
foresee
developments
like
that.
what
they
did
was
to
give
us
a
broad
grand
of
authority
under
a
public
interest
standard,
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
is
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
mr.
henry
geller
we
regulate
the
networks
at
the
present
time
to
their
affiliates.
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
–
that's
common
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
this
common
carrier
jurisdiction.
we
regulate
the
rates
that
are
charged
in
networks.
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
we
have
regulated
the
common
carrier
aspects,
the
common
carrier
reserves
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
it
hasn't
your
honor
because
when
we
want
to
regulate
the
networks,
we
have
gone
in
two
ways
to
do
that.
one
way,
we
have
gone
is
to
make
regulations
applicable
to
their
affiliates
saying
that
we
will
not
renew
the
license
of
an
affiliate
which
engages
in
any
activity
we
consider
inconsistent.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
the
cable
that
serves
a
network
is
a
common
carrier.
it
will
serve
anybody
who
comes
along
and
we
have
held
and
all
the
parties
are
in
agreement
on
this,
said
the
catv
is
not
a
common
carrier.
it
does
not
take
messages
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
have
declined
to
do
it.
mr.
henry
geller
uh
mm.
mr.
henry
geller
by
cable,
you
mean
the
networks,
sir?
i
want
to
make
sure
–
mr.
henry
geller
--
because
on
the
network,
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
law
applicable
which
says
in
303
(i)
that
we
can
make
regulations
applicable
to
radio
stations
engaged
in
chain
broadcasting.
we
therefore
focus
on
that
when
we
act
in
the
network
field.
and
we
have
adopted
regulations
that
go
–
we
–
that
go
to
the
affiliate
and
we
are
now
proposing,
your
honor,
to
adopt
regulations
in
the
television
area
that
go
directly
to
the
network
television
licensee.
we
say,
they
are
radio
stations
engaged
in
chain
broadcasting
and
we
--
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
a
303
(i)
determines
what
we
do
in
this
area,
and
we
are
proposing
direct
regulation
of
the
television
network.
now,
that
is
being
disputed
by
them
and
eventually,
that's
a
different
issue
of
me
come
before
the
courts
and
have
to
be
settled.
but
--
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
geller
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
geller
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
says,
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
applicable
to
all
interstate
communication
by
wire.
the
provisions
that
we
are
applying
are
303
(h)
and
307
(b)
which
call
for
these
plans
and
what
the
--
since
catv
is
extending
the
service
area
station,
we
say
we
can
make
those
provisions
applicable.
now,
an
argument
comes
back
that
the
provision
for
making
applicable
are
radio
provisions
and
we're
making
them
applicable
to
a
wire
system
and
that
there
is
a
rigid
dichotomy
here.
and
to
that
we
cite
section
1
of
the
act
that
says
that,
the
authorities
being
centralized
in
1
(h)
and
(c)
in
order
to
get
this
efficient
nationwide
system.
previous
to
the
1934
act,
the
icc
had
wire
and
the
federal
radio
commission
had
radio.
and
the
congress
said
in
the
reports
that
we've
cited
that,
there
is
a
need
for
a
unified
jurisdiction
here
for
one
comprehensive
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
industry.
and
that's
why
they
centralized
the
authority
in
the
commission
and
we
are
exercising
that
centralized
authority
over
both
wire
and
radio
in
order
to
achieve
this
efficient
nationwide
system
of
local
television
outlets,
but
that
is
a
statement
--
you're
correcting
your
statement
of
the
basis
upon
which
we
are
asserting
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
if
–
well,
what
we
do
save
point
to
though
is
we
have
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
that
says,
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
well,
it's
explicit.
i
think
the
congress
meant
to
say
that
we
want
you
to
have
the
unified
jurisdiction
over
wire
and
radio
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
would
have
jurisdiction
over
but
we
would
have
no
provisions
we'd
be
carrying
out.
there
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
henry
geller
that's
correct.
absolutely.
mr.
henry
geller
no,
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
it
doesn't
help
us
because
then
the
next
question
comes,
what
are
you
doing
to
carry
it
out?
what
provisions
are
you
carrying
it
out?
but
we
say
here
that
there
are
--
mr.
henry
geller
oh,
no,
your
honor.
we
start
with
that
but
you
then
have
to
go
--
we're
not
saying
that
we
could
regulate
them
just
because
there
are
wire
communications.
as
you
say,
we're
regulating
them
because
there
are
wire
communications
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
are
regulating
them
because
they
are
wire
communication
which
is
extending
the
service
area
stations
and
having
an
impact
on
the
nationwide
system
with
television
allocation
and
that
is
the
basis
that
we
are
doing
it.
now
the
chenery
problem
that
was
raised,
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of
was
it
we
did
bring
up
the
point
that
we
could
also
regulate
them
as
radio
communication
as
incidental
to
the
transmission
of
radio
communication.
we
don't
believe
there
is
chenery
point
there
either
because
this
is
a
legal
matter.
chenery
applied
when
–
as
to
policy.
if
the
agency
decided
to
act
on
one
policy
and
then
in
court
tried
to
shift,
in
chenery
said
you
couldn't
do
that.
but
we
have
enunciated
the
policy
in
the
major
market
in
the
carriage
of
non-duplication.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
legal
power
to
do
so
and
we
believe
we
do?
on
the
basis
that
they
are
interstate
communication
by
wire
which
is
affecting,
extending
the
service
area
and
affecting
the
plan
and
also
on
the
basis
that
they
are
radio
communication
coming
in
within
that
definition
also.
and
incidentally
we
did
note
in
our
memorandum
of
law,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
could
come
within
either
one
of
them,
either
3
(a)
or
3
(b),
either
in
the
state
communication
by
wire
or
the
radio.
we
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
resolve.
now
there
is
one
other
argument
made
in
here
in
jurisdiction
and
that
is
it
--
we
have
disclaimed
jurisdiction
previously.
in
1959,
when
we
considered
this
question,
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
pass
on
the
issue
whether
we
had
jurisdiction,
because
of
the
impact
on
broadcasting.
we
found
that
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
we
found
no
impact.
we
expressly
reserved
the
question
to
the
jurisdiction
on
that
basis
and
we
have
never
disclaimed
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
which
is
now
asserted
here
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
validity
of
our
interim
relief
order,
our
orders
that
specify
that
pending
the
outcome
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
respondents
could
not
expend
their
system
to
throughout
los
angels
–
throughout
san
diego
with
these
los
angles
signals
until
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
when
we
looked
that
it
1959,
we
found
no
impact.
we
think
the
impact
begin
coming
in
with
a
vengeance
in
the
early
1960's.
mr.
henry
geller
now
with
this
rapid
spurt
in
growth
and
there
was
a
revolutionary
new
change
where
it
began
going
in
to
the
--
the
major
markets.
mr.
henry
geller
and
there
were
a
lot
of
claims
of
impact
before,
but
when
held
the
hearings
we
could
not
prove
them
and
therefore
we
took
no
action.
mr.
henry
geller
about
1962.
that
was
a
beginning
of
it,
1962
and
1963,
but
it
--
it
began
accelerating
very
rapidly
after
that.
mr.
henry
geller
our
brief
states
fully
the
nature
of
our
jurisdiction
over
catv,
if
we
go
--
mr.
henry
geller
no.
mr.
henry
geller
no.
we
think
--
say
we
can
carry
out
the
allocation
provision
to
prevent
them
from
the
extending
a
service
area
in
such
a
way
is
direct
local
service.
mr.
henry
geller
we
think
--
mr.
henry
geller
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
henry
geller
by
rule
and
by
order.
mr.
henry
geller
yes.
we
--
we
do
licenses
in
station
and
specify
what
it
could
conserve.
and
we
go
--
mr.
henry
geller
no,
we
could
not.
mr.
henry
geller
because
the
catv
picks
up
the
signal,
moves
it
about
and
the
station
has
no
--
they
do
not
come
within
what
is
called
section
325
(a)
the
rebroadcast
prevision.
broadcast
stations
have
to
get
permission
to
pick
up
a
signal
and
rebroadcast
it.
the
catv
is
not
a
broadcast
station
so
it
just
picks
the
signal
up
and
moves
it
around.
the
station
couldn't
do
so,
it
couldn't
put
a
translator,
for
example.
mr.
henry
geller
it
does
this
without
permission.
mr.
henry
geller
because
in
--
in
practical
effect
it
is
extending
the
service
area.
it's
taking
the
service
area
of
the
station,
the
new
york
stations
and
moving
them
into
new
york.
now,
the
station
has
nothing
to
say
about
it,
but
the
effect
from
point
of
view
our
allocation
plan
is
the
same.
the
--
there
are
new
york
signals
being
carried,
perhaps
ups
to
50%
to
85%
of
all
our
homes
in
philadelphia
if
it's
allowed
to
grow
and
that
has
the
same
affect
as
if
it
the
stations
had
done.
and
we
are
looking
if
what
the
effect
is
saying
that
this
is
an
interstate
communication
by
wire
which
is
--
which
is
extending
that
service
area
and
if
possibly
ruining
the
new
competition,
we
want
in
philadelphia.
instead
of
getting
new
stations
in
philadelphia
that
could
be
the
basis
of
the
fourth
network,
well,
we're
getting
in
adjusting
new
york
signals
coming,
they
are
not
local.
mr.
henry
geller
there
will
be
no
problem
on
that.
we
would
not
--
mr.
henry
geller
because
the
--
that
happens
all
the
time,
both
the
movie
houses
and
--
and
the
tv
stations
are
competing
for
product?
mr.
henry
geller
well,
we
--
what
we
say
is
what's
happening
here
it's
a
catv
is
taking
a
tv
signal
and
actually
extending
the
service
area
of
that
tv
signal
into
another
community
and
that
this
commission
was
created
to
control.
we
--
3038
says
if
this
commission
is
to
define
the
service
area
of
station
and
that
service
areas
suddenly
moved
from
new
york
in
the
philadelphia
and
we
--
to
the
detriment
of
our
--
of
the
public
interest
and
larger
more
effective
use
of
radio
and
we
say,
we
can
control
that.
we
have
to
be
able
to
control
it
and
that's
the
difference
between
them.
mr.
henry
geller
we
would
not
seek
to
regulated
in
any
way
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that.
we
--
we
don't
have
a
jurisdiction
over
bowling
alleys
and
movie
houses
anything
doing
what
--
they
are
extending
--
they
not
in
the
state
communication
by
wire
that
is
extending
the
service
area
stations.
that's
all
we've
claim
to
do.
we
carry
out
mr.
justice
fortas
other
provisions
to
the
act
that
we
haven't
gone
in
here
such
as
315
and
317.
mr.
henry
geller
but,
we
say
as
a
practical
matter
that's
what
are
they
do.
they
can
take
a
signal
from
new
york
into
washington.
now
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
our
position
is
that
the
--
that
respondents
really
are
ignoring
the
whole
basic
regulatory
scheme
here.
that
scheme
is
design
to
take
hold
of
this
situation
and
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
entrenchment,
that's
what
1107
does.
it's
says,
you
can't
move
new
york
signals
into
philadelphia
until
we
determine
that's
in
the
public
interest.
and
that's
precisely
what
1109
is
intended
to
do
here
also
and
it's
particularized
to
application;
it
says,
you
cannot
spread
los
angeles
signals
throughout
san
diego
until
we
will
resolve
that
question.
now,
we
could
have
adopted
a
blanket
rule
to
that
effect.
we
couldn't
adopted
the
rule
that
said
that
the
catv
system
which
is
operating
in
one
of
these
top
100
market
communities
and
which
has
very
low
penetration
and
bringing
in
a
signal
from
another
community
which
is
not
viewed
to
any
great
extent,
cannot
extend
its
--
its
operations
on
effective
date
of
our
rule
until
we
have
resolved
that
public
interest
question.
that
would
have
been
a
perfectly
reasonable
rule.
it
would
have
the
same
public
interest
basis
as
the
1107
rule.
it
should
not
have
catv
operations
going
through
out
a
community
that
can
effect
the
development
of
uhf
until
we
resolve
the
public
interest
question
and
as
i
said
--
mr.
henry
geller
we
believe
we
clearly
could
have
done
that.
mr.
henry
geller
oh,
yes.
i'm
assuming
now
to
--
mr.
henry
geller
i'm
assuming
your
honor
that
we
have
jurisdiction.
at
this
point,
we
are
all
assuming
we
have
jurisdiction
in
respondents
and
the
--
mr.
henry
geller
i
[laughter]
i
beg
your
pardon.
let
me
put
a
phrase
respondent
cited.
they
--
there
argument
is,
in
assuming
we
have
jurisdiction
over
catv
and
assuming
that
the
major
marker
policy
is
reasonable
and
even
assuming
at
the
end
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
we
could
order
roll
back
of
service,
they
say
we
cannot
issue
this
interim
relief
for
it.
and
i'm
saying
assuming
that
we
could
have
adopted
this
blanket
rule,
if
we
had
adopted
this
blanket
rule,
it
wouldn't
stopped
them
right
in
their
tracks
at
the
date
that
the
rule
became
effective.
instead
of
doing
that,
we
adopted
the
much
more
reasonable
procedure
of
1109
where
we
can
give
particularized
consideration
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
most
appropriate
relief
here?
in
san
diego
for
example,
the
pleading
showed
there
had
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
all
the
facets
to
the
major
market
question
were
there.
the
pleadings
also
showed
that
--
there
are
--
that
they
were
this
eight
islands
service,
eight
discreet
areas
and
that
is
not
in
dispute.
there
was
no
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
one
issue
in
dispute
and
we
resolved
that
in
favor
of
the
catv.
so
that
we
could
look
and
see
that
the
place
to
halt
this,
what
--
these
eight
discreet
areas
and
we
can
allow
them
to
grow
in
these
areas
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
the
all
out
expansion
that
would
frustrate
the
very
purpose
of
the
hearing.
mr.
henry
geller
by
a
man.
they
were
affidavits
attached
and
to
both
--
to
the
pleading
of
the
petitioner
showing
where
there
were,
these
affidavits
were
not
disputed
except
to
one
instance.
and
then
we
--
we
--
mr.
henry
geller
--
in
favor
to
san
diego.
mr.
henry
geller
there
are
different
parts
of
san
diego.
chula
vista
would
be
one
discreet
area
and
they
could
expand
in
there.
paauwee
would
be
another
and
they
are
--
they
were
various
areas
in
san
diego
where
they
could
continue
their
growth.
mr.
henry
geller
right.
mr.
henry
geller
and
what
respondents
argument
comes
down
to
we
are
argue
therefore
is
that,
he's
saying
we
can
approach
this
problem
by
a
rule
that
would
halt
and
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
the
outcome
of
the
hearing,
but
that
we
can't
do
it
by
the
more
flexible
approach
of
--
of
1109.
now,
we
could
have
adopted
that
rule.
we
agree
we
could
have,
but
our
position
here
is
that
under
chenery,
the
agency
has
the
discretion
to
proceed
by
way
of
ad
hoc
particularized
proceedings.
they
have
--
it
feels
that's
appropriate.
that
here
that
is
obviously
more
appropriate.
it's
fair
to
the
catv.
and
if
--
this
is
really
one
reasonable
overall
scheme
of
hearing
--
evidentiary
hearing
before
entrenchment
and
that
this
is
a
perfectly
proper
way,
1109,
of
carrying
out
that
scheme
and
one
that's
available
under
4
(i)
in
303
(r).
now,
they
argued
that
4
(i)
and
303
(r)
just
housekeeping
provisions,
that
you
can
adopt
rules.
well,
the
4
(j)
is
the
provision
that
allow
us
to
adopt
rules.
4
(i)
and
303
(r)
allow
the
commission
to
issue
rules,
orders,
and
other
actions
is
that
maybe
necessary
in
the
--
in
the
execution
of
its
functions.
and
this
court
has
in
storer
and
in
american
trucking
said
that,
these
were
--
these
provisions
mean
just
what
they
say.
they
are
broad
grants
of
authority
to
take
action
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
on
the
312
point.
it's
argued
there
are
actions
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
cease-and-desist
provisions.
312
is
applicable
when
the
commission
is
trying
to
halt
some
activity
as
a
legal
that
it
violates
the
rule
or
the
act.
if
we
hold
the
very
short
evidentiary
hearing
then,
determine
whether
is
a
fact
finding
one,
to
determine
whether
the
activity
is
a
legal
that
is
we
order
to
hold.
we
didn't
do
that
here.
we
were
not
concerned
with
finding
out
whether
any
activity
was
illegal.
we
did
not
order
any
halt
to
ongoing
activity.
what
were
are
concern
with
doing
here
is
formulating
the
standard
particularizing
the
application
of
the
major
market
policy
to
the
san
diego
area.
and
we
urge
that
we
can
do
so
under
chenery
by
this
ad
hoc
procedure
and
therefore,
the
existence
of
312,
no
more
bursars
proceeding
with
this
ad
hoc
waive
and
it
does
the
main
approach
of
1107.
if
we
have
jurisdiction,
this
court
finds
to
regulate
catv
and
the
major
market
policy
is
reasonable
and
there
is
no
showing
that
ti
is
not
then
we
urge
that
we
have
the
power
to
adopt
these
reasonable
ad
hoc
procedures
and
to
take
the
action
that
we
need
to
under
the
explicit
language
of
4
(i)
and
303
(r).
