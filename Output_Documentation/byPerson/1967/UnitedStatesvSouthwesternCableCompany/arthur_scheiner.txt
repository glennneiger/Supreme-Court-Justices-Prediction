mr.
arthur
scheiner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
have
please
the
court.
at
the
very
outset,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
first
question
in
this
case,
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
commission.
this
question
comes
up
in
connection
with
respondent
catv
systems
which
are
off
the
air
or
none
microwave
fed
and
in
that
respect,
certainly
do
not
utilize
the
radio
spectrum.
now
our
attempt,
our
position
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
a
two-pronged
basis.
the
commission
asserts
that
its
jurisdiction
stems
from
section
2
(a),
its
authority
over
interstate
wire
albeit
by
a
non-common
carrier,
we
submit
on
two
basis
that
the
commission
is
in
error.
first,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
interstate
communication
by
wire
by
non-common
carriers
except
to
the
extent
that
such
authority
is
conferred
under
the
provisions
of
the
act.
secondly,
we
urge
that
the
commission
is
lacking
in
jurisdiction
because
there
are
no
standards,
no
criteria,
no
definition,
no
congressional
guidance
of
any
nature
whatsoever
with
a
respect
to
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
that's
asserted.
let
me
address
myself
to
each
of
these
basis
in
turn.
first,
it
is
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
commission's
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
catv,
it
has
never
asserted
jurisdiction
over
interstate
communication
by
wire,
by
non-common
carries.
that
statement
is
made
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
controverted
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
only
answer
is
and
i
believe
i'm
quoting
“we
did
not
probe
that
question.”
when
i
say
that
it
has
never
done
it,
it
has
never
done
it
despite
the
existence
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
of
such
interstate
communication
by
wire
non-common
carriers,
the
typical
example
of
the
rights
of
y
companies.
now,
i
fully
recognize
rights
the
y
companies
words
reasonable
and
feasible
to
utilize
such
a
mode
of
communication.
now,
this
type
of
wire
use
obviously
does
differ
from
the
use
involved
here.
namely
that's
the
rights
of
y
companies
clearly
had
no
so-called
“impact”.
they
are
not
involved
then
television
broadcasting.
but
i
respectfully
invite
the
court's
attention
to
those
portions
of
our
brief
which
detail
at
considerable
length
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
the
ap
and
upi
wire
services
from
the
purview
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
we
put
particular
stress,
although,
we
have
termed
the
absolute
and
force
grant
analogy
to
the
networks.
we
say
it's
absolutely
in
distinguishable
in
ever
single
respect.
the
networks
use
interstate
wire.
they
use
it
on
the
transcontinental
basis
when
respect
to
impact.
i
think
the
court
may
take
the
first
jurisdictional
notice.
in
fact,
the
commission
itself
has
recognized
to
the
networks
the
very
life
blood
of
television
broadcasting
and
in
the
case
of
the
networks,
there
has
been
an
explicit
disavow
of
direct
authority
over
the
networks.
true
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
no,
sir.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
catv
systems
and
i
might
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
catv
systems,
your
honor
are
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
local
city
governments,
county
governments,
and
at
least
in
the
case
of
two
states,
connecticut
and
nevada
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
public
utilities
commission
--
commissions
and
are
regulated
as
such.
in
this
may
i
suggest,
there's
not
a
use
of
patient
of
power
by
the
local
governmental
entities
but
rather
is
pursuant
to
the
explicit
invitation
and
recognition
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
the
selection
of
the
franchise
holders,
their
mode
of
operation
and
all
of
the
indica
of
their
operation,
are
quiet
properly
determined
at
the
local
level
and
not
by
the
federal
communications
commission
except
to
the
limited
degree
to
which
the
commission
has
asserted
jurisdiction.
however
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
curiously,
the
commission
if
i
may
answer
in
this
fashion,
the
commission
disavows
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
the
commission
explicitly
disavows
jurisdiction
of
the
catv
systems
on
the
grounds
that
such
systems
are
common
carriers
that
is
excluded
precariously.
if
it
had
asserted
jurisdiction
over
catv
systems
on
that
ground,
we
would
not
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
title
ii,
common
carrier
of
the
communications
act
by
reason
of
explicit
exclusion
under
section
2
(b)
of
the
act.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
in
delegating
authority
to
the
federal
communications
commission
did
not
delegate
or
legislate
to
the
full
extent
of
the
commerce
clause.
it
provided
that
so-called
connecting
carriers,
carriers
operating
within
the
state
are
not
subject
to
the
common
carrier
type
regulation
of
federal
communications
commission.
as
it
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
regulation
by
the
federal
communications
commission?
mr.
arthur
scheiner
oh,
certainly.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
oh,
certainly.
in
the
case
of
connecticut
and
nevada
they
are
presently
regulated
by
two
public
utilities
commissions.
in
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
well,
in
the
case
of
connecticut
with
which
i
am
most
familiar,
that
agency,
the
public
utilities
commission,
prescribed
with
great
precision
the
programs
that
might
be
carried,
the
amounts
that
might
be
charged
the
customer,
the
technical
quality
of
the
service,
the
whole
host
of
characteristics
and
indica
of
common
carrier
regulation
of
public
utility
regulation
and
that
was
fully
provided
for
by
the
connecticut
state
statute.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
it's
rather
difficult
to
characterize
very
briefly
the
thrust
of
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
in
the
state
to
connecticut.i
do
think
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
think
it's
fair
to
--
fair
to
say
that
that
the
primary
function
was
to
protect
people
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
--
i
do
not
believe
so
because
the
question
in
--
as
i
view
it
didn't
arise.
it
was
the
regulation
of
catv
systems
located
within
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
--
i
do
not
view
it
in
that
fashion
and
second
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
is
without
power,
i
suggest
the
ready
answer
is,
that
such
power
maybe
conferred
by
congress
and
the
commission
has
sought
such
authority
from
congress
on
several
occasions
and
thus
far
without
success,
but
i
do
think
that
there
are
number
of
very
serious
and
very
difficult
legislative
type
determinations
to
be
made.
for
example,
is
it
appropriate
that
this
type
of
new
activity
which
has
been
exempted
from
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
commission?
should
this
type
of
activity
be
regulated
by
a
federal
agency
and
if
so
should
it
be
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission?
we
may
all
agree
that
the
aviation
for
air
transport
industry
is
clearly
the
proper
subject
to
regulation,
but
clearly
should
it
be
regulated
by
the
icc?
now,
these
are
profound
and
difficult
questions
to
answer,
but
they
are
questions
of
a
legislative
nature.
we
have
made,
if
i
may
continue?
mr.
arthur
scheiner
we
have
made
a
second
basic
attack
on
the
jurisdiction
asserted
by
the
commission,
simply
there
no
criteria
or
standards
of
any
kind.
in
answer
to
that
contention,
we
get
two
curious
replies
in
its
reply
brief
and
i
submit
for
the
first
time
the
commission,
i'm
sorry,
the
government
asserts
the
criteria
and
standards
that
you
think
are
required
are
spelled
out
in
title
iii
and
more
particularly,
the
broadcast
provisions
of
title
iii.
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
their
brief
when
i
say,
they
say,
“these
provisions
are
quiet
explicit
and
catv
systems
are
subject
to
those
explicit
provisions.”
the
other
petitioner
in
its
original
brief
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
federal
communications
commission
under
the
statutory
scheme
at
its
option
could
have
regulated
catv
systems
as
common
carriers.
so,
we
now
have
three
claimed
basis
of
jurisdiction;
interstate
wire
or
alternatively,
if
you
don't
like
that
one,
the
government
urges
radio,
broadcast
provisions
of
radio
and
if
you
don't
care
for
that
one
regulate
them
as
common
carriers.
and
these
arguments
are
submitted
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
there
are
no
criteria
whatsoever
governing
the
purported
assertion
of
jurisdiction,
but
let
as
examine
the
government's
contention.
i
think,
i
submit,
it
is
absolutely
untenable
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
broadcast
provisions
of
title
iii
of
the
communications
act
are
applicable
and
govern
the
regulation
of
catv
systems.
if
so,
in
the
case
of
broadcasting,
it
is
the
commission
which
picks
licensees.
for
the
statuary
limited
term
of
3
years
and
picks
them
based
on
specified
statuary
criteria
including
character,
financial
qualifications,
technical
qualifications
and
the
frequencies
are
granted
free
in
broadcasting
and
broadcasting
is
explicitly
examined
from
the
provisions
of
the
common
carrier
sections.
in
broadcasting
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts,
a
state
may
not
censor
broadcast,
a
state
may
not
impose
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
operation
broadcast
stations.
contrast
that
if
you
will
with
the
whole
scheme
of
the
so-called
regulatory
regime
as
applied
to
catv.
as
i
stated
earlier,
these
licenses
are
granted
pursuant
to
commission
invitation
of
solicitation
by
a
host
of
local
authorities.
they
are
granted
on
a
basis
of
local
criteria
for
periods
arranging
up
from
three
years
to
much,
much
greater
periods.
in
the
case
of
the
san
diego
systems,
we
pay
a
gross
receipts
tax
unlike
broadcasting.
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
specific
provisions
of
broadcasting
in
title
iii
apply
to
the
regulation
of
catv
and
this
is
the
definition
of
limitation
that
we
say
does
not
exist
in
the
act.
these
propositions
i
respectfully
submit
is
completely
untenable.
let
me
give
two
specific
examples
if
may,
under
section
326
of
the
communications
act
and
this
was
not
cited
in
our
brief
for
the
reason
that
the
government
rely
on
the
–
relies
on
the
explicit
provisions
of
broadcasting
was
raise
for
the
first
time
in
its
replied
brief.
but
under
section
326
it
is
provided,
“no
regulation
or
condition
shall
be
promulgated
or
fixed
by
the
commission
which
i'll
interfere
with
right
of
free
speech
by
means
radio
communication.
that
i
submit
is
what
the
second
report
is
all
about.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
your
honor
please
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
basically,
we
must
distinguish
between
two
types
of
situations
and
in
mr.
geller's
opening
argument
yesterday
he
said,
“counsel
on
this
case
do
not
in
test
the
validity
of
commission
regulation
of
a
microwave
fed
systems.
we
don't
contest
it
because
it's
not
an
issue
on
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
operating
within
the
commission's
rules.
we
are
delivering
the
so-called
grade
b
signals
and
grade
b
signals
in
my
layman's
terms
or
signals
which
the
station
is
authorize
to
deliver.
we
are
not
carrying
new
york
signals
to
chicago.
we
are
operating
with
in
the
confines
of
the
commission's
own
allocation
report.
as
the
court
below
found,
we
are
local
in
ever
respect
and
this
was
explicitly
considered
by
the
commission.
we're
delivering
the
very
signals
which
the
commission's
allocation
plans,
presumed
station
would
be
authorized
to
deliver.
that
is
the
function
of
the
catv
systems
on
this
case.
i
do
have
one
further
point
in
connection
with
the
lack
of
standards
argument.
and
this
sir
relates
to
the
--
it
is
a
procedural
point.
if
in
fact
the
broadcast
previsions
of
title
iii
apply,
let
us
assume
that
we
were
now
a
licensee.
if
we
were
a
licensee
and
the
commission
wanted
makes
some
change
in
the
mode
of
our
operation,
the
height
or
the
power
pursuant
to
which
we
were
authorize
to
operate,
it
would
have
to
do
among
other
things
at
least
two.
first,
under
the
section
316
of
the
act,
the
commission
would
have
to
tell
us
what
it
proposed
to
do
us?
second,
it
would
have
to
tell
us
the
reasons
therefore.
third,
it
would
have
to
give
us
notice,
a
30-days
notice
for
a
hearing
and
in
that
hearing
the
commission
would
have
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence
and
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
we
have
been
--
now
translating
that
316
requirement
to
the
facts
to
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
been
under
sentence
by
the
commission
for
19
to
20
months.
the
very
first
time
that
we
will
be
advised
that
what
it
is
that
the
commission
proposes
to
do
translating
this
to
the
316
analogy,
the
specific
broadcast
provisions
which
counsel
asserts
furnish
the
limitation.
the
first
time
that
we
will
be
told,
of
what
the
commission
proposes
to
do,
is
when
the
commission
issues
its
final
report
in
the
pending
evidentiary
proceeding
which
is
now
before
the
commission
itself.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
then
--
then
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
start
over
again.
we
would
have
the
opportunity
for
a
judicial
review
by
the
–
it
will
be
the
federal,
one
other
thing
in
the
pending
case
before
the
commission.
it
was
not
the
commission
that
assumed
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence.
it
was
not
the
commission
that
assumed
the
burden
of
proof
but
in
those
two
respects,
petitioner
mid-west
and
respondent
catv
systems
pursuant
to
commission
order
shared
various
portions
of
these
burdens.
in
a
sense,
we've
been
dealing
in
the
dark
for
close
to
two
years.
the
commission
has
never
advised
us
much
less
in
writing
of
what
the
nature
of
the
changes,
restrictions,
and
limitations
are?
and
this
raises
what
i
submit
is
one
of
the
very
basic
and
in
our
view
fatal
defects
in
the
scheme
of
the
second
report.
in
the
second
report,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
write
the
rules
of
this
game
and
they're
detailed
and
they're
specific.
and
it
is
stipulated
and
found
by
the
court
below
that
we
are
in
compliance,
but
they
write
one
additional
rule.
the
risk,
i
don't
believe
this
is
an
over
statement,
i
don't
think
that
rule
find
its
parallel
anywhere
in
any
other
administrative
agency.
that
rule
explicitly
says,
“having
written
the
rules
of
the
game,
we
can
change
them
at
anytime
we
please,
in
any
manner
we
please,
and
to
whomsoever
we
please
and
i
would
like
if
may,
to
refer
the
court
to
the
provisions
of
section
1109
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
that
section
says
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that's
page
81
of
the
appendix
in
the
buff
colored
volume.
it
is
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
the
rule
1109
says,
“upon
the
petition
and
skipping
the
intervening
words,
upon
the
position
in
effect
of
any
interested
person,
the
commission
may
waive
any
provisions
of
the
rules
relating
to
the
distribution
of
television
signals
by
catv
systems
impose
additional
or
different
requirements
or
issue
a
ruling
on
a
complaint
or
disputed
question.”
that
is
the
standard
on
which
are
case
has
been
tried.
the
commission
may
impose
additional
or
different
requirements.
square
that
i
suggest,
with
the
mandatory
requirements
of
section
316
of
the
communications
act
and
this
is
terribly
important
in
our
view,
for
the
reason
that
throughout
the
entire
act,
there
is
one
grand
overwhelming
concern
expressed
by
the
congress
in
section
312,
provision
relating
to
the
revocation
of
broadcast
licensees
or
the
issuance
of
cease-and-desist
orders,
316
which
i
described,
section
204
relating
to
the
imposition
of
requirements
or
changes
on
common
carriers,
the
one
grand
premise
expressed
throughout
the
act
is
a
deep
concern
for
the
protection
by
way
of
procedural
due
process
of
all
other
persons
who
are
licensed
or
do
business
subject
to
--
or
by
reason
of
commission
license,
franchise
or
authorization.
and
that
grant
concerned
is
completely
ignored
by
the
government's
view
that
the
commission
proceeded
properly
in
the
face
of
section
312,
in
the
face
of
these
other
provisions
by
saying,
we
can
do
what
we
will,
when
we
will,
and
in
any
matter
that
we
chose
to
do
it,
and
will
tell
you
for
the
first
time
when
we
issue
of
final
report.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
sir,
the
answer
would
not
be
the
same
and
the
reason
is
that
in
the
alloca
--
in
the
use
of
the
spectrum
space,
the
transmission
of
radio
energy,
the
commission
does
have
quiet
extensive
power.
there
is
built
in
to
the
utilization
of
spectrum
space
of
necessity
a
judgment
as
to
how
the
spectrum
space
should
be
use.
there's
a
quality
judgment
involve
and
that
is,
is
it
better
use
for
one
purpose
than
for
another
purpose.
of
necessity,
the
agency
has
to
make
that
determination.
so
precisely
stated,
i
would
not
make
the
same
answer
in
that
case.
however,
the
one
significant
point
which
follows
from
this
is
that,
we
might
very
well
find
our
selves
in
a
most
anomalous
position.
two
systems
side
by
side;
one
system
utilizing
spectrum
space
and
the
other
not
utilizing
the
spectrum
space.
one
subject
to
the
commission's
rather
plenary
authority
over
the
utilization
of
radio
spectrum
and
the
other
free
of
the
same
type
of
federal
regulation.
now,
this
is
anomalous
situation
which
suggest
only
that
the
necessity
for
regulation
is
an
area
of
proper
legislative
concern.
problems
of
this
nature
–
problems
of
and
the
other
types
of
problems
that
i
address
myself
too,
are
properly
to
be
resolved
as
a
result
of
a
careful
and
deliberate
legislative
concern.
for
example,
if
your
honor
would
refer
to
appendix
a
in
southwestern's
brief,
where
at
the
request
of
the
government,
a
bill
was
sponsored
looking
towards
conferring
of
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
congress
in
that
bill
at
least
rather
meticulously
reviewed
the
appropriate
provisions
of
the
communications
act.
and
in
title
iii
of
that
act,
as
reflected
in
appendix
a,
the
--
and
i'm
never
now
referring
to
page
82
of
respondent
southwestern's
brief
the
blue
covered
brief,
the
congress
in
the
proposed
bill,
section
330
(b)
detailed
8
or
10
provisions
of
title
iii
which
were
applicable
ignoring
obviously
a
number
of
others.
it
is
this
kind
of
determination
which
i
submit
is
the
appropriate
decision
to
make
by
an
informed
legislature.
it
is
not
in
our
view,
the
kind
of
determination
which
the
agency
itself
may
make
without
any
guidance
or
limitation
of
any
kind.
sir,
i've
been
advised
that
i've
used
my
time,
if
their
no
further
questions.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
have
please
the
court.
at
the
very
outset,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
first
question
in
this
case,
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
commission.
this
question
comes
up
in
connection
with
respondent
catv
systems
which
are
off
the
air
or
none
microwave
fed
and
in
that
respect,
certainly
do
not
utilize
the
radio
spectrum.
now
our
attempt,
our
position
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
a
two-pronged
basis.
the
commission
asserts
that
its
jurisdiction
stems
from
section
2
(a),
its
authority
over
interstate
wire
albeit
by
a
non-common
carrier,
we
submit
on
two
basis
that
the
commission
is
in
error.
first,
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
interstate
communication
by
wire
by
non-common
carriers
except
to
the
extent
that
such
authority
is
conferred
under
the
provisions
of
the
act.
secondly,
we
urge
that
the
commission
is
lacking
in
jurisdiction
because
there
are
no
standards,
no
criteria,
no
definition,
no
congressional
guidance
of
any
nature
whatsoever
with
a
respect
to
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
that's
asserted.
let
me
address
myself
to
each
of
these
basis
in
turn.
first,
it
is
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
commission's
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
catv,
it
has
never
asserted
jurisdiction
over
interstate
communication
by
wire,
by
non-common
carries.
that
statement
is
made
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
controverted
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
only
answer
is
and
i
believe
i'm
quoting
“we
did
not
probe
that
question.”
when
i
say
that
it
has
never
done
it,
it
has
never
done
it
despite
the
existence
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
of
such
interstate
communication
by
wire
non-common
carriers,
the
typical
example
of
the
rights
of
y
companies.
now,
i
fully
recognize
rights
the
y
companies
words
reasonable
and
feasible
to
utilize
such
a
mode
of
communication.
now,
this
type
of
wire
use
obviously
does
differ
from
the
use
involved
here.
namely
that's
the
rights
of
y
companies
clearly
had
no
so-called
“impact”.
they
are
not
involved
then
television
broadcasting.
but
i
respectfully
invite
the
court's
attention
to
those
portions
of
our
brief
which
detail
at
considerable
length
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
the
ap
and
upi
wire
services
from
the
purview
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
we
put
particular
stress,
although,
we
have
termed
the
absolute
and
force
grant
analogy
to
the
networks.
we
say
it's
absolutely
in
distinguishable
in
ever
single
respect.
the
networks
use
interstate
wire.
they
use
it
on
the
transcontinental
basis
when
respect
to
impact.
i
think
the
court
may
take
the
first
jurisdictional
notice.
in
fact,
the
commission
itself
has
recognized
to
the
networks
the
very
life
blood
of
television
broadcasting
and
in
the
case
of
the
networks,
there
has
been
an
explicit
disavow
of
direct
authority
over
the
networks.
true
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
no,
sir.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
catv
systems
and
i
might
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
catv
systems,
your
honor
are
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
local
city
governments,
county
governments,
and
at
least
in
the
case
of
two
states,
connecticut
and
nevada
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
public
utilities
commission
--
commissions
and
are
regulated
as
such.
in
this
may
i
suggest,
there's
not
a
use
of
patient
of
power
by
the
local
governmental
entities
but
rather
is
pursuant
to
the
explicit
invitation
and
recognition
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
the
selection
of
the
franchise
holders,
their
mode
of
operation
and
all
of
the
indica
of
their
operation,
are
quiet
properly
determined
at
the
local
level
and
not
by
the
federal
communications
commission
except
to
the
limited
degree
to
which
the
commission
has
asserted
jurisdiction.
however
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
curiously,
the
commission
if
i
may
answer
in
this
fashion,
the
commission
disavows
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
the
commission
explicitly
disavows
jurisdiction
of
the
catv
systems
on
the
grounds
that
such
systems
are
common
carriers
that
is
excluded
precariously.
if
it
had
asserted
jurisdiction
over
catv
systems
on
that
ground,
we
would
not
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
title
ii,
common
carrier
of
the
communications
act
by
reason
of
explicit
exclusion
under
section
2
(b)
of
the
act.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
in
delegating
authority
to
the
federal
communications
commission
did
not
delegate
or
legislate
to
the
full
extent
of
the
commerce
clause.
it
provided
that
so-called
connecting
carriers,
carriers
operating
within
the
state
are
not
subject
to
the
common
carrier
type
regulation
of
federal
communications
commission.
as
it
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
regulation
by
the
federal
communications
commission?
mr.
arthur
scheiner
oh,
certainly.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
oh,
certainly.
in
the
case
of
connecticut
and
nevada
they
are
presently
regulated
by
two
public
utilities
commissions.
in
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
well,
in
the
case
of
connecticut
with
which
i
am
most
familiar,
that
agency,
the
public
utilities
commission,
prescribed
with
great
precision
the
programs
that
might
be
carried,
the
amounts
that
might
be
charged
the
customer,
the
technical
quality
of
the
service,
the
whole
host
of
characteristics
and
indica
of
common
carrier
regulation
of
public
utility
regulation
and
that
was
fully
provided
for
by
the
connecticut
state
statute.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
it's
rather
difficult
to
characterize
very
briefly
the
thrust
of
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
in
the
state
to
connecticut.i
do
think
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
think
it's
fair
to
--
fair
to
say
that
that
the
primary
function
was
to
protect
people
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
--
i
do
not
believe
so
because
the
question
in
--
as
i
view
it
didn't
arise.
it
was
the
regulation
of
catv
systems
located
within
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i
--
i
do
not
view
it
in
that
fashion
and
second
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
is
without
power,
i
suggest
the
ready
answer
is,
that
such
power
maybe
conferred
by
congress
and
the
commission
has
sought
such
authority
from
congress
on
several
occasions
and
thus
far
without
success,
but
i
do
think
that
there
are
number
of
very
serious
and
very
difficult
legislative
type
determinations
to
be
made.
for
example,
is
it
appropriate
that
this
type
of
new
activity
which
has
been
exempted
from
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
commission?
should
this
type
of
activity
be
regulated
by
a
federal
agency
and
if
so
should
it
be
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission?
we
may
all
agree
that
the
aviation
for
air
transport
industry
is
clearly
the
proper
subject
to
regulation,
but
clearly
should
it
be
regulated
by
the
icc?
now,
these
are
profound
and
difficult
questions
to
answer,
but
they
are
questions
of
a
legislative
nature.
we
have
made,
if
i
may
continue?
mr.
arthur
scheiner
we
have
made
a
second
basic
attack
on
the
jurisdiction
asserted
by
the
commission,
simply
there
no
criteria
or
standards
of
any
kind.
in
answer
to
that
contention,
we
get
two
curious
replies
in
its
reply
brief
and
i
submit
for
the
first
time
the
commission,
i'm
sorry,
the
government
asserts
the
criteria
and
standards
that
you
think
are
required
are
spelled
out
in
title
iii
and
more
particularly,
the
broadcast
provisions
of
title
iii.
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
their
brief
when
i
say,
they
say,
“these
provisions
are
quiet
explicit
and
catv
systems
are
subject
to
those
explicit
provisions.”
the
other
petitioner
in
its
original
brief
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
federal
communications
commission
under
the
statutory
scheme
at
its
option
could
have
regulated
catv
systems
as
common
carriers.
so,
we
now
have
three
claimed
basis
of
jurisdiction;
interstate
wire
or
alternatively,
if
you
don't
like
that
one,
the
government
urges
radio,
broadcast
provisions
of
radio
and
if
you
don't
care
for
that
one
regulate
them
as
common
carriers.
and
these
arguments
are
submitted
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
there
are
no
criteria
whatsoever
governing
the
purported
assertion
of
jurisdiction,
but
let
as
examine
the
government's
contention.
i
think,
i
submit,
it
is
absolutely
untenable
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
broadcast
provisions
of
title
iii
of
the
communications
act
are
applicable
and
govern
the
regulation
of
catv
systems.
if
so,
in
the
case
of
broadcasting,
it
is
the
commission
which
picks
licensees.
for
the
statuary
limited
term
of
3
years
and
picks
them
based
on
specified
statuary
criteria
including
character,
financial
qualifications,
technical
qualifications
and
the
frequencies
are
granted
free
in
broadcasting
and
broadcasting
is
explicitly
examined
from
the
provisions
of
the
common
carrier
sections.
in
broadcasting
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts,
a
state
may
not
censor
broadcast,
a
state
may
not
impose
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
operation
broadcast
stations.
contrast
that
if
you
will
with
the
whole
scheme
of
the
so-called
regulatory
regime
as
applied
to
catv.
as
i
stated
earlier,
these
licenses
are
granted
pursuant
to
commission
invitation
of
solicitation
by
a
host
of
local
authorities.
they
are
granted
on
a
basis
of
local
criteria
for
periods
arranging
up
from
three
years
to
much,
much
greater
periods.
in
the
case
of
the
san
diego
systems,
we
pay
a
gross
receipts
tax
unlike
broadcasting.
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
specific
provisions
of
broadcasting
in
title
iii
apply
to
the
regulation
of
catv
and
this
is
the
definition
of
limitation
that
we
say
does
not
exist
in
the
act.
these
propositions
i
respectfully
submit
is
completely
untenable.
let
me
give
two
specific
examples
if
may,
under
section
326
of
the
communications
act
and
this
was
not
cited
in
our
brief
for
the
reason
that
the
government
rely
on
the
–
relies
on
the
explicit
provisions
of
broadcasting
was
raise
for
the
first
time
in
its
replied
brief.
but
under
section
326
it
is
provided,
“no
regulation
or
condition
shall
be
promulgated
or
fixed
by
the
commission
which
i'll
interfere
with
right
of
free
speech
by
means
radio
communication.
that
i
submit
is
what
the
second
report
is
all
about.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
your
honor
please
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
basically,
we
must
distinguish
between
two
types
of
situations
and
in
mr.
geller's
opening
argument
yesterday
he
said,
“counsel
on
this
case
do
not
in
test
the
validity
of
commission
regulation
of
a
microwave
fed
systems.
we
don't
contest
it
because
it's
not
an
issue
on
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
operating
within
the
commission's
rules.
we
are
delivering
the
so-called
grade
b
signals
and
grade
b
signals
in
my
layman's
terms
or
signals
which
the
station
is
authorize
to
deliver.
we
are
not
carrying
new
york
signals
to
chicago.
we
are
operating
with
in
the
confines
of
the
commission's
own
allocation
report.
as
the
court
below
found,
we
are
local
in
ever
respect
and
this
was
explicitly
considered
by
the
commission.
we're
delivering
the
very
signals
which
the
commission's
allocation
plans,
presumed
station
would
be
authorized
to
deliver.
that
is
the
function
of
the
catv
systems
on
this
case.
i
do
have
one
further
point
in
connection
with
the
lack
of
standards
argument.
and
this
sir
relates
to
the
--
it
is
a
procedural
point.
if
in
fact
the
broadcast
previsions
of
title
iii
apply,
let
us
assume
that
we
were
now
a
licensee.
if
we
were
a
licensee
and
the
commission
wanted
makes
some
change
in
the
mode
of
our
operation,
the
height
or
the
power
pursuant
to
which
we
were
authorize
to
operate,
it
would
have
to
do
among
other
things
at
least
two.
first,
under
the
section
316
of
the
act,
the
commission
would
have
to
tell
us
what
it
proposed
to
do
us?
second,
it
would
have
to
tell
us
the
reasons
therefore.
third,
it
would
have
to
give
us
notice,
a
30-days
notice
for
a
hearing
and
in
that
hearing
the
commission
would
have
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence
and
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
we
have
been
--
now
translating
that
316
requirement
to
the
facts
to
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
been
under
sentence
by
the
commission
for
19
to
20
months.
the
very
first
time
that
we
will
be
advised
that
what
it
is
that
the
commission
proposes
to
do
translating
this
to
the
316
analogy,
the
specific
broadcast
provisions
which
counsel
asserts
furnish
the
limitation.
the
first
time
that
we
will
be
told,
of
what
the
commission
proposes
to
do,
is
when
the
commission
issues
its
final
report
in
the
pending
evidentiary
proceeding
which
is
now
before
the
commission
itself.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
then
--
then
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
start
over
again.
we
would
have
the
opportunity
for
a
judicial
review
by
the
–
it
will
be
the
federal,
one
other
thing
in
the
pending
case
before
the
commission.
it
was
not
the
commission
that
assumed
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence.
it
was
not
the
commission
that
assumed
the
burden
of
proof
but
in
those
two
respects,
petitioner
mid-west
and
respondent
catv
systems
pursuant
to
commission
order
shared
various
portions
of
these
burdens.
in
a
sense,
we've
been
dealing
in
the
dark
for
close
to
two
years.
the
commission
has
never
advised
us
much
less
in
writing
of
what
the
nature
of
the
changes,
restrictions,
and
limitations
are?
and
this
raises
what
i
submit
is
one
of
the
very
basic
and
in
our
view
fatal
defects
in
the
scheme
of
the
second
report.
in
the
second
report,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
write
the
rules
of
this
game
and
they're
detailed
and
they're
specific.
and
it
is
stipulated
and
found
by
the
court
below
that
we
are
in
compliance,
but
they
write
one
additional
rule.
the
risk,
i
don't
believe
this
is
an
over
statement,
i
don't
think
that
rule
find
its
parallel
anywhere
in
any
other
administrative
agency.
that
rule
explicitly
says,
“having
written
the
rules
of
the
game,
we
can
change
them
at
anytime
we
please,
in
any
manner
we
please,
and
to
whomsoever
we
please
and
i
would
like
if
may,
to
refer
the
court
to
the
provisions
of
section
1109
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
that
section
says
--
mr.
arthur
scheiner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that's
page
81
of
the
appendix
in
the
buff
colored
volume.
it
is
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
the
rule
1109
says,
“upon
the
petition
and
skipping
the
intervening
words,
upon
the
position
in
effect
of
any
interested
person,
the
commission
may
waive
any
provisions
of
the
rules
relating
to
the
distribution
of
television
signals
by
catv
systems
impose
additional
or
different
requirements
or
issue
a
ruling
on
a
complaint
or
disputed
question.”
that
is
the
standard
on
which
are
case
has
been
tried.
the
commission
may
impose
additional
or
different
requirements.
square
that
i
suggest,
with
the
mandatory
requirements
of
section
316
of
the
communications
act
and
this
is
terribly
important
in
our
view,
for
the
reason
that
throughout
the
entire
act,
there
is
one
grand
overwhelming
concern
expressed
by
the
congress
in
section
312,
provision
relating
to
the
revocation
of
broadcast
licensees
or
the
issuance
of
cease-and-desist
orders,
316
which
i
described,
section
204
relating
to
the
imposition
of
requirements
or
changes
on
common
carriers,
the
one
grand
premise
expressed
throughout
the
act
is
a
deep
concern
for
the
protection
by
way
of
procedural
due
process
of
all
other
persons
who
are
licensed
or
do
business
subject
to
--
or
by
reason
of
commission
license,
franchise
or
authorization.
and
that
grant
concerned
is
completely
ignored
by
the
government's
view
that
the
commission
proceeded
properly
in
the
face
of
section
312,
in
the
face
of
these
other
provisions
by
saying,
we
can
do
what
we
will,
when
we
will,
and
in
any
matter
that
we
chose
to
do
it,
and
will
tell
you
for
the
first
time
when
we
issue
of
final
report.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
sir,
the
answer
would
not
be
the
same
and
the
reason
is
that
in
the
alloca
--
in
the
use
of
the
spectrum
space,
the
transmission
of
radio
energy,
the
commission
does
have
quiet
extensive
power.
there
is
built
in
to
the
utilization
of
spectrum
space
of
necessity
a
judgment
as
to
how
the
spectrum
space
should
be
use.
there's
a
quality
judgment
involve
and
that
is,
is
it
better
use
for
one
purpose
than
for
another
purpose.
of
necessity,
the
agency
has
to
make
that
determination.
so
precisely
stated,
i
would
not
make
the
same
answer
in
that
case.
however,
the
one
significant
point
which
follows
from
this
is
that,
we
might
very
well
find
our
selves
in
a
most
anomalous
position.
two
systems
side
by
side;
one
system
utilizing
spectrum
space
and
the
other
not
utilizing
the
spectrum
space.
one
subject
to
the
commission's
rather
plenary
authority
over
the
utilization
of
radio
spectrum
and
the
other
free
of
the
same
type
of
federal
regulation.
now,
this
is
anomalous
situation
which
suggest
only
that
the
necessity
for
regulation
is
an
area
of
proper
legislative
concern.
problems
of
this
nature
–
problems
of
and
the
other
types
of
problems
that
i
address
myself
too,
are
properly
to
be
resolved
as
a
result
of
a
careful
and
deliberate
legislative
concern.
for
example,
if
your
honor
would
refer
to
appendix
a
in
southwestern's
brief,
where
at
the
request
of
the
government,
a
bill
was
sponsored
looking
towards
conferring
of
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
congress
in
that
bill
at
least
rather
meticulously
reviewed
the
appropriate
provisions
of
the
communications
act.
and
in
title
iii
of
that
act,
as
reflected
in
appendix
a,
the
--
and
i'm
never
now
referring
to
page
82
of
respondent
southwestern's
brief
the
blue
covered
brief,
the
congress
in
the
proposed
bill,
section
330
(b)
detailed
8
or
10
provisions
of
title
iii
which
were
applicable
ignoring
obviously
a
number
of
others.
it
is
this
kind
of
determination
which
i
submit
is
the
appropriate
decision
to
make
by
an
informed
legislature.
it
is
not
in
our
view,
the
kind
of
determination
which
the
agency
itself
may
make
without
any
guidance
or
limitation
of
any
kind.
sir,
i've
been
advised
that
i've
used
my
time,
if
their
no
further
questions.
mr.
arthur
scheiner
thank
you,
sir.
