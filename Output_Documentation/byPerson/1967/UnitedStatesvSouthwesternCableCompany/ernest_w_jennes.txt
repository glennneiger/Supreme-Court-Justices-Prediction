mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
state
once
more
the
basis
of
the
assertion
by
the
fcc
of
jurisdiction
here
because
i
fear
it's
been
a
bit
confused.
the
commission's
assertion
here
is
not
based
upon
the
notion
of
implied
power.
it
is
based
squarely
on
the
fact
that
catv
systems
are
engaged
in
inter-state
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
they
extend
the
signals
of
television
broadcast
stations
and
the
have
an
impact
on
national
communications
policy,
and
there
are
specific
provisions
of
the
act
to
implement
these
jurisdictional
provisions.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
sir?
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
no.
i'm
saying
that
the
act
specifically
applies
to
communication
by
wire,
interstate
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
catv
systems
clearly
come
within
that
definition.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
and
that
if
i
may
–
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
--
and
that
if
i
may
section
2
(a)
of
the
communications
act
says,
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
apply
to
all
interstate
and
foreign
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
now,
this
is
not
implicit.
this
is
an
explicit
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
then
we
find
the
provisions
in
the
act
that
apply.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
well
as
to
wire
communication,
catv
transmits
the
signals,
pictures,
and
sounds
by
wire
and
cable
between
the
points
of
origin
and
reception
of
such
transmission.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
and
reception
of
the
said
translation.
in
other
words,
between
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
from
the
point
of
which
the
catv
system
picks
the
signal
up
above
the
air
to
the
point
of
which
it
carries
it
to
the
--
into
the
home
and
it
does
engaged
in
wire
communication.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
sir?
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
the
commission
may
embrace
all
of
the
specific
powers
that
are
given
to
it
by
the
statute
such
as
section
4
(i)
which
is
an
issue
here
to
implement
the
policies
which
are
to
be
found
in
provisions
like
section
307
(b),
the
provisions
limiting
the
–
the
reach
of
television
signals
and
the
like.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
well
within
the
context
of
this
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
right
and
similar
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
--
under
title
iii.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
right.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
right.
may
i
suggest
also
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
no,
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
then
we're
talking
about
inherit
powers
and
this
case
is
not
about
inherit
powers,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
about
express
powers.
may
i
suggest
also
that
the
policy
question
is
not
as
respondents
would
have
it
one
of
government
protection
of
vested
broadcast
interest
against
competition.
this
specific
case
deals
with
whether
the
san
diego
area
is
to
have
a
full
measure
of
its
own
competitive
service
or
is
to
be
a
television
satellite
of
los
angeles
served
principally
or
exclusively
by
los
angeles
stations
via
cable.
and
more
fundamental
in
san
diego
and
throughout
the
country,
fcc
regulation
of
catv
extension
of
distance
signals
is
necessary
because
there's
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
there
would
be
and
increasing
concentration
and
centralization
rather
than
expansion
of
media
of
communications.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
well,
i
think
that
the
sander's
case
has
indicated
that
--
that
if
–
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
--
that
if
the
extent
of
the
competition
as
such
as
to
take
away
services
to
something
that
commission
should
take
into
account.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
plus
the
fact
that
under
the
broadcast
rules
of
the
commission
which
are
aimed
to
prevent
concentration
these
los
angeles
television
stations
can't
serve
san
diego
directly.
they
can't
own
san
diego
broadcast
outlets
to
rebroadcast
their
signals.
indeed,
there's
a
short
limit
on
the
number
of
television
stations
that
maybe
commonly
owned
by
a
single
entity
and
yet
without
catv
regulation,
catv
by
extending
their
signals
could
to
for
these
large
los
angeles
stations
where
they
can't
do
for
themselves.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
it
has
been
suggested
that
if
the
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
here
that
these
matters
would
all
be
taking
care
off
by
the
states.
i
suggest
respectfully
that
the
states
are
not
concerned
with
the
communications
policy
for
the
nation
as
a
whole.
they
are
concerned
with
their
own
local
but
important
networks
and
under
the
communications
act
as
this
court
said
in
bennetti,
here
was
provided
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
and
i
might
say
also
that
it's
quite
interesting
and
noteworthy
that
when
the
catv
interests
are
appearing
before
state
public
utility
commissions
on
the
matter
of
public
utility
regulation
of
catv,
they
then
content
that
catv
is
an
interstate
commerce
and
there
any
state
regulation
of
that
kind
is
preempted
by
the
federal
communications
act.
now,
the
system
of
regulation
which
the
commission
has
adopted
was
intended
to
resolve
public
interest
considerations
before
entrenchment
of
catv
extension
of
distance
signals.
and
the
commission
singled
out
different
kinds
of
situations
for
handling
in
different
manners.
i
can't
over
emphasize
that
the
concept
of
interim
relief
to
maintain
the
situation
until
