justice
abe
fortas
what's
that
last
thing
you
said
mr.
sobol?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
it
would
be
easier
for
me
if
you
tell
me
what
you
think
we
ought
to
decide,
what
rule
should
this
court
adopt?
what
rules
are
you
urging
us
to
adopt?
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
this
one,
yes,
as
to
louisiana.
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
does
that
mean?
you
seem
to
be
arguing
--
you're
saying
that
there's
no
category
of
petty
offenses
in
louisiana?
justice
abe
fortas
so
just
what
--
how
do
you
suggest
we
describe
it
if
we
would
go
along
with
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
let's
see
where
we
are
then.
what
you're
suggesting
is
that,
we
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
of
jury
trials
applies
to
the
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
dividing
line
which
every
state
has
to
observe
is
the
federal
dividing
line
as
stated
as
indicated
by
cheff;
namely
six
months
potential
punishment.
justice
abe
fortas
six
months
actual
or
six
months
depends?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
what
do
you
ask?
what
are
you
referring
to?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
we
are
to
lay
down
a
rule
that's
applicable
to
all
of
the
states
in
which
we
say
that
if
a
potential
sentence
exceeds
six
months,
then
the
jury
trial
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment
has
to
be
observed
by
each
state?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
number
one,
you
think
it'd
be
nice
if
we
said
that
if
we
announce
six-month
rule
is
applicable
to
the
states.
number
two,
if
we
don't
want
to
be
that
bold,
we
can
adopt
the
gideon
approach.
justice
abe
fortas
and
leave
it
for
the
future?
justice
abe
fortas
now
i
want
to
ask
you
another
question.
does
your
analysis
mean
that
the
states
would
have
to
adopt
a
12-man
jury
system
and
unanimous
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
it
does?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
the
louisiana
system,
jury
system,
would
have
to
give
way
to
the
federal
system?
justice
abe
fortas
i
appreciate
that
mr.
sobol.
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
any
more
than
i
have
to.
do
i
correctly
recall
that
somewhere
in
your
brief,
you
discount
the
effect
of
the
civil
law
tradition
on
the
jury
trial
provisions
that
obtained
in
louisiana?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
that
the
present
system
of
dispensing
or
with
jury
trial
--
with
full
jury
trial
right
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
civil
law
system
as
it
applied
in
louisiana?
justice
abe
fortas
i
say,
you
don't
believe
that
the
present
system
with
respect
to
jury
trials
in
louisiana
is
really
sort
of
a
natural
growth
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
civil
law
system?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sobol,
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument
mean
that
in
the
segregation
case,
let's
say
where
the
court
has
entered
an
order
for
school
desegregation
or
what
not,
and
there's
disobedience
of
that
order
that
the
subsequent
contempt
proceeding
would
have
to
be
--
that
have
be
a
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
taking
both
ways.
i'm
taking
it
from
the
state
court.
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
take
a
state
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
state
court
that
had
issued
such
an
order?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
about
anything
in
your
case.
i'm
asking
about
the
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
vigorously
advocated
here.
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
come
on.
give
me
an
answer
to
this
question,
will
you?
what
is
your
view
as
to
the
thrust
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
a
contempt
order
entered
by
a
state
court
in
a
segregation
case?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
court
should
determine?
justice
abe
fortas
should
determine
that
it
is
a
crime
for
purposes
of
jury
trial
and
then
what?
justice
abe
fortas
the
jury
trial
would
have
to
be
given
in
the
segregation
cases
in
the
contempt
proceeding
in
the
state
segregation
case.
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
you
stop
with
cited
[laughter]?
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
sobol
said
that
34.1
does
not
provide
for
hard
labor,
and
therefore
it
is
not
a
felony
under
louisiana
law.
is
that
incorrect?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
is
no
provision
for
hard
labor?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
disagree
with
mr.
sobol
that
generally
where
the
louisiana
law
does
not
provide
for
hard
labor,
the
defined
crime
is
not
a
felony?
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
an
exception.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
provided
under
any
of
the
criminal
statutes
that
is
not
a
felony?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
do
they
get
for
wearing
it
on
mardi
gras?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
wolbrette,
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
regardless
of
the
term
or
circumstances
of
imprisonment
that
the
determining
factor
is
a
nature
of
the
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
what's
the
other
one?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
anything
up
to
three
years
that
if
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
wearing
of
a
hood
or
a
simple
battery
and
if
the
maximum
period
of
confinement
should
be
three
years,
then
you
don't
have
to
have
a
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
i
invite
you
to
assist
us
in
terms
the
theory
because
we
do
have
to
consider
that
what
of
course
is
involved
here.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
five
years?
suppose
it
was
five
years,
what
would
the
difference
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
principle
for
what
you're
arguing?
that's
what
i
fail
to
get
here.
do
you
say
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
under
no
circumstances,
should
the
federal
constitution
operate
so
as
to
require
a
state
to
provide
a
jury
trial?
or,
are
you
saying
that
under
some
circumstances,
the
federal
constitution
does
require
a
state
hold
a
--
to
grant
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
a
capital
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
you
that.
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
federal
constitution,
whether
there's
anything
in
the
federal
constitution
that
would
make
it
unlawful
under
our
system
of
government,
or
a
state
to
provide
for
capital
--
for
a
trial
of
capital
case
without
a
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
ma'am.
is
that
your
total
answer
ma'am?
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
view
of
the
principle
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
that's
your
answer
to
it,
then
that's
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they're
summing
in
the
magna
carta
about
juries?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
have
a
very
pretty
good
idea
what
magna
carta
says,
but
in
some
reference
to
the
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
ma'am,
but
that
does
indicate
that
at
least
there
were
some
old
fellows
in
the
13th
century
who
thought
that
the
jury
was
a
fairly
valuable
institution.
justice
abe
fortas
and
maybe
times
have
changed
in
this
rather
so
solely
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
then
i
certainly
don't
press
the
point
that
that's
dispositive,
but
there
is
a
kind
of
tradition,
or
folklore
whichever
you
want
to
call
it,
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
is
an
important
institution
in
a
man
who
searched
for
freedom
and
fairness.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
ma'am?
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
thrust
from
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
still
prepared
as
a
theoretical
matter
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment's
guarantees
would
permit
a
state
to
try
a
capital
offense
and
sentence
a
person
to
execution
without
a
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
but
isn't
that
the
thrust
of
your
argument?

kind
of
tradition,
or
folklore
whichever
you
want
to
call
it,
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
is
an
important
institution
in
a

who

for
freedom
and

ma'am?
justice

maybe
i
misunderstood
the
thrust

justice
abe
fortas

say
that
the
fourteenth

would
permit
a
state
to
try
a
capital
offense
and
sentence
a
person
to
execution
without
a
jury?
justice
abe

but
isn't
that

of
your
argument?
