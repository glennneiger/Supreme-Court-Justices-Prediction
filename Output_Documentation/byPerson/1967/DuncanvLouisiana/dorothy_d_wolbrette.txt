ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
wolbrette.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
exceedingly
simple.
the
simple
facts
as
shown
by
the
record
make
it
clear
that
appellant
who
was
19
years
old,
even
according
to
his
own
testimony,
made
an
intentional
bodily
contact
on
the
victim
who
was
14
years
old
without
his
consent.
the
simple
facts
of
this
case
show
that
the
appellant
committed
a
simple
battery
of
misdemeanor.
that
he
was
given
a
fair
trial
and
that
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
the
parish
jail,
and
a
$150.00
fine.
the
60-day
sentence
for
a
simple
battery
brings
this
case
squarely
under
this
court's
decision
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg,
if
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
applies
to
the
states.
cheff
held
that
the
imposition
of
an
actual
sentence
of
six
months
or
less
is
constitutionally
permissible
under
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment
without
a
trial
by
jury
if
the
inherent
nature
of
the
offense
charged
is
that
of
a
petty
offense
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
answers
your
question
about
the
federal
system.
it
would
have
to
be
a
serious,
i
mean,
it
would
have
to
be
a
petty
--
the
nature
of
the
offense
would
have
to
be
petty.
therefore,
it
could
not
involve
any
crime
in
a
federal
system
with
more
than
a
year
penalty
because
if
you
have
more
than
a
year
penalty,
you
go
to
the
federal
--
you
may
go
to
the
federal
penitentiary
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
an
infamous
offense
in
the
federal
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that's
what
cheff
said.
i'm
not
saying
it,
cheff
said
it.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
your
honor
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
no
difference
your
honor,
as
between
contempt
and
other
crimes
there
are
crimes
with
indefinite
sentences.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i'm
not
saying
it
this
is
what
cheff
held.
i'm
telling
you
what
cheff
held.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
any
crime
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
the
rule
which
cheff
put
up
is
what
you
just
said.
now
new
york
does
this
very
thing
and
so
does
everyone
(voice
overlap)
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
i
am
merely
stating
to
you
what
this
court
in
its
latest
decision
on
this
particular
point
held
and
that's
cheff.
this
is
exactly
what
cheff
held.
and
as
i
started
to
point
out
to
you,
new
york
uses
this
very
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
for
its
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
new
york
doesn't
think
so
and
england
doesn't
think
so.
england
uses
this
very
system
for
simple
batteries.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
they
use
it
to
determine
--
what
happens
is,
you
go
into
the
inferior
court,
the
judge
listens
to
some
of
the
testimony.
if
he
decides
it
from
the
circumstances,
in
his
opinion
it's
a
more
serious
offense
than
should
be
tried
summarily
without
a
jury.
he
then
sends
it
out
to
a
higher
court
where
he's
tried
by
indictment
with
the
jury.
that's
the
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
in
the
paris
jail,
of
course.
how
can
i
deny
it?
that's
the
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
six
months,
that's
the
test
which
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
your
honor,
cheff
did
not
consider
the
potential
sentence
at
all.
the
penalty
for
criminal
contempt
in
the
federal
courts
is
unlimited.
and
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent
in
cheff,
federal
courts
have
been
known
to
give
sentences
for
criminal
contempt
as
long
as
four
years.
so
you
had
the
same
problem
there.
now
under
cheff,
my
appreciation
of
the
â€“
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
yes
sir
we
do.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
he
would
not
have
determined
guilt
at
that
point
and
it
wouldn't
be
double
jeopardy.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
we
obviously
haven't
reached
that
problem
yet.
but
i'm
sure
if
we
did,
i
believe
that
the
court
would
say
that
this
is
not
what
is
determined
to
be
double
jeopardy.
i'm
sure
new
york
has
solved
that
problem.
now
under
cheff,
the
test
recognized
that
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
frankly
your
honor,
i
haven't
researched
that
point.
i'm
sure
that
new
york
has
met
that
problem
because
that
is
the
system
that
they
use
if
we
will
refer
to
the
amicus
brief
of
new
york
you
will
see
that
this
is
what
new
york
uses.
and
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
some
cases
then
in
new
york
state.
and
if
you
want,
i'll
submit
you
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
particular
point,
but
you're
asking
me
something
that
i
haven't
really
researched.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
now
under
cheff,
the
test
recognized
for
determining
of
petty
offense
are
one,
the
actual
sentence
imposed
is
six
months
or
less
and
two,
the
character
of
the
offense
charged
must
be
petty.
this
prosecution
meets
both
tests
of
cheff
because
the
sentence
actually
imposed
was
60
days
and
the
offense
charged
simple
battery
as
defined
in
louisiana
is
a
petty
offense.
simple
battery
in
louisiana
is
the
intentional
use
of
force
of
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
without
the
consent
of
the
victim,
and
without
a
dangerous
weapon.
intent
to
injure,
actual
bodily
injury
and
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
are
not
elements
of
simple
battery.
consent
to
the
victim
is
a
defense
so
that
the
identical
conduct
with
the
victim's
consent
is
not
a
crime
in
louisiana.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
of
course.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
mean,
i
would
not
argue
that
i
fit
it
under
cheff
now.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what
would
i
put
my
argument
on?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
of
course
i'm
going
--
then
i
would
go
into
my
--
oh!
i
know
what
you're
talking
about.
then
you're
talking
about
with
the
two-year
maximum
potential
penalty,
if
it
was
seven
months,
would
the
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
with
my
two-year
maximum
penalty
of
my
statute
then
deprive
him
of
due
process,
or
would
it
require
a
jury.
and
of
course
it
would
not,
because
you're
not
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no.
it
would
not
require
a
jury,
certainly
not.
the
potential
maximum
sentence
of
two
months
would
not
require
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
my
position
would
be
i
would
not
be
under
cheff,
because
the
actual
sentence
would
be
more
than
six
months
but
my
position
would
be,
that
he
would
still
not
require
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
then
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
maximum.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
i
skipped
a
step
on
it.
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
maximum.
well
in
addition
to
many
other
factors
i'd
have
to
look
at
the
inherent
nature
of
the
offense,
but
i
would
also
look
at
the
maximum
potential
sentence.
now
as
pointed
out
by
frankfurter
&
corcoran
in
their
article
which
has
been
cited
by
this
court
and
recognized,
there
are
many
--
there
have
been
many
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
cited.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
used
as
a
basis
for
your
opinion
in
district
of
columbia
versus
collins.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
cited,
and
used
as
authority.
there
are
many
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
it
is
certainly
recognized
as
an
authoritative
work
on
what
is
a
serious
crime,
what
was
a
serious
crime
at
common
law,
and
then
the
colonies
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
sixth
amendment.
for
example,
they
point
out
that
orsen
(ph)
was
not
triable
by
jury.
that
it
carried
a
penalty
of
seven
years
transportation
or
one
and
half
years
at
hard
labor,
robbery,
and
indefinite
confinement
at
hard
labor
an
innkeeper
allowing
tippling
an
indefinite
confinement,
vagabondage
a
severe
whipping
in
confinement
pending
sessions,
producing
illegitimate
children,
an
indefinite
confinement,
robbery,
one
month
at
hard
labor
and
a
severe
whipping.
now
today,
a
severe
whipping
would
be
considered
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment.
vagrancy
31
lashes.
in
new
york,
any
offense
less
than
grand
larceny
would
take
an
indefinite
penalty.
and
your
honor,
i
have
a
whole
bunch
of
them
listed.
i
really
would
rather
not
take
anymore
time,
but
i
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't
think
he
put
that
in
sir,
i
don't
recall
that
one.
new
york,
three
years
for
vagrancy
was
cited
in
the
clawans
case.
so
i
say
that
even
if
you
look
at
the
maximum
potential
penalty,
our
man
still
does
not
require
a
jury
trial.
he
does
not
go
to
the
penitentiary.
he
goes
to
the
parish
jail
which
is
a
substantial
difference.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
a
lot
of
difference.
you
have
civil
disabilities
for
one
thing
that
result
when
you're
convicted
of
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what's
that?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
at
hard
labor,
what
are
the
differences?
it's
the
difference
in
treatment
and
the
difference
in
hard
labor
that
things
that
a
person
has
to
do.
and
it
is
certainly
a
more
disgraceful
thing
to
go
to
the
penitentiary
considered
that
way
in
a
community
than
to
be
sentenced
to
parish
jail.
may
i
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh
no
sir!
that
is
absolutely
wrong.
that
is
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
section
34.1
of
the
louisiana
criminal
code.
now
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
is
not
a
misdemeanor,
it
is
a
felony.
the
source
act
of
section
34.1
is
act
69
of
1960
and
under
that
act,
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
is
a
felony.
it
is
not
a
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we've
never
had
a
prosecution
under
it.
but
as
a
felony,
it
would
have
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we've
had
aggravated
battery
as
defined
in
section
34
which
is
general
type
of
aggravated
battery,
but
we
have
never
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
ten
years.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
and
that's
trial
by
jury,
of
course.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
you
asked
about
the
one
-
i'm
sorry
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
one
that
he
referred
to
as
a
misdemeanor.
there
are
two
aggravated
batteries.
there's
section
34
which
is
aggravated
battery
which
requires
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
and
then
there's
34.1
which
is
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
which
requires
bodily
injury
and
they
are
both
felonies.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
is
incorrect
because
the
source
act
is
section
is
act
69
of
1960.
and
the
source
act
provides
that
it
is
--
that
that
particular
crime
is
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
but
it's
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh!
definitely
it
is
a
felony,
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
generally,
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
this
is
an
exception,
because
it
specifically
provides
that
it
is
a
felony
in
the
source
act.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
the
maximum
--
that
is
not
a
felony?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
one
for
three
years
which
is
wearing
a
hood
in
the
streets
except
on
mardi
gras.
[laughter]
it
takes
three
years
and
it's
a
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
nothing,
nothing.[laughter]
your
party
said
you
don't
wear
one
on
mardi
gras.
your
honor,
we
say
that
simple
battery
is
a
trivial
offense
enacted
under
the
state's
police
power.
it's
not
too
offensive
to
the
community's
moral
purposes.
it's
not
too
close
to
society's
dangers
and
these
are
tests
which
have
been
used
by
this
court
in
determining
what
is
a
minor
offense.
we
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
simple
battery
or
misdemeanor
in
louisiana,
and
aggravated
battery
which
is
a
felony.
aggravated
battery
in
louisiana
involves
serious
conduct
and
as
a
felony,
it
is
triable
by
jury.
it's
punishable
in
the
penitentiary,
and
it
necessarily
involves
the
laws
of
important
civil
rights
such
as
the
right
to
vote.
simple
battery
involves
minor
conduct
and
of
course,
it's
a
misdemeanor.
and
the
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
does
not
involve
the
laws
of
any
civil
rights
at
all
and
it
is
not
punishable
in
the
penitentiary.
historically,
conduct
constituting
simple
battery
has
been
treated
as
a
petty
offense,
not
only
in
louisiana,
but
also
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
england
as
authorities
in
our
brief
show.
the
frankfurter
&
corcoran
article
which
was
cited,
in
the
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans
mentions
assault
and
battery
as
a
petty
offense
triable
without
a
jury.
throughout
the
united
states,
simple
battery
is
a
typical
petty
offense
as
our
brief
shows.
in
england,
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
adopted,
simple
battery
was
a
minor
offense
triable
without
indictment
and
without
a
jury,
as
our
brief
demonstrates.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
arguing
that
that
is
one
of
the
important
factors.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
the
court
has
looked
at
the
maximum
potential
sentence
and
that
has
been
modified
in
cheff
by
saying
that
when
the
actual
sentence
is
six
months
or
less.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
am
saying
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far.
the
only
point
to
which
the
court
has
to
go
on
this
case
is
the
two-year
maximum.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
as
pointed
out
in
d.c.
versus
clawans,
there
was
a
three-year
maximum
penalty
for
vagrancy
in
new
york.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
really
couldn't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i've
just
considered
really
two
years
and
possibly
three
years.
i
don't
know
of
that
five
years.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
tried
to
apply
--
go
ahead.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i'm
saying
that
the
state
may
modify
the
scope
of
jury
trial
and
that
louisiana
has
modified
the
scope
of
jury
trial
within
whatever
limits
maybe
provided
by
the
constitution.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
the
question
there
would
--
it
takes
two
parts.
could
a
judge
try
a
capital
offense
fairly?
yes
he
could.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
your
honor,
louisiana
provides
for
the
trial
of
a
capital
case
with
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
tried
to
answer
you
but
you
said
that
that
wasn't
the
answer.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
said
that
the
test
is
a
fair
trial.
now,
can
a
judge
give
a
fair
trial
in
a
murder
case?
then
i
say,
of
course
a
judge
can
give
a
fair
trial
in
a
murder
case.
now
of
course,
if
you
want
to
look
at
history,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
precedent
for
a
capital
crime
being
tried
or
not
much
precedent
for
a
capital
crime
being
tried
without
a
jury.
so
on
the
basis
of
history
it
is
quite
possible
that
we
could
say
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
try
without
a
jury.
but
i'm
saying
that
a
state
has
the
right
to
modify
the
scope
of
jury
trial
as
louisiana
has
done
in
this
case.
i'm
also
saying
that
because
the
decision
of
the
decision
in
cheff,
this
court
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
hopefully
will
decide
this
case
on
the
narrower
ground
that
appellant's
prosecution
was
for
a
petty
offense,
which
is
exempted
from
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
under
the
cheff
decision.
but
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
deems
it
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
of
applicability
to
the
states
of
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right,
then
we
maintain
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states.
in
deciding
this
issue,
we
call
this
court's
attention
to
patton
versus
the
united
states
and
the
consequences
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
requiring
all
the
states
to
try
crimes
by
12-man
unanimous
jurors.
this
would
be
a
necessary
incident
of
a
crime
with
sixth
amendment
directly
to
the
states.
since
the
barron
decision
in
1833,
this
court
has
held
in
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
that
the
bill
of
rights
applies
only
against
the
federal
government
and
not
against
states.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
are
those
changed
--
are
those?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that's
right.
but
what
i'm
pointing
at,
i'm
going
from
general
to
specific
if
you
will
allow
me.
the
fact
that
certain
rights
have
been
found
fundamental
and
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
mean
that
all
are.
the
fact
that
certain
restrictions
are
placed
on
the
federal
courts
does
not
mean
that
the
same
restrictions
must
be
imposed
on
state
courts.
unlike
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
is
not
an
abstract
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
based
on
fundamental
fairness.
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
deals
only
with
the
preservation
of
a
concrete
institution,
the
common
law
12-man
jury
as
it
existed
in
1787.
under
the
sixth
amendment
change
in
the
common
law
jury
is
impossible.
it
isn't
reasonable
to
argue
that
such
a
rigid
unchangeable
institution
as
the
18th
century
common
law
jury
in
which
procedural
reform
is
impossible
represents
a
fundamental
right
which
is
necessary
to
a
fair
trial
in
state
court.
jury
trial
exists
in
federal
court
by
reason
of
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment.
jury
trial
exists
in
state
court
by
reason
of
state
law.
the
only
vehicle
for
applying
the
federal
jury
trial
right
to
the
states
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
due
process
does
not
demand
trial
by
jury.
the
test
under
due
process
is
whether
a
jury
is
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
contrary
to
appellant's
arguments,
recent
decisions
of
this
court
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what
kind
of
trial
would
it
be?
as
i
say
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
no
i'm
saying
that
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no
sir,
i'm
saying
that
the
only
test
under
due
process
is
whether
a
jury
trial
is
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh,
you
mean
in
any
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
in
any
case
as
far
as
a
fair
trial
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
a
judge
certainly
can
try
any
defendant
fairly.
contrary
to
appellant's
argument,
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
undermined
the
validity
of
maxwell
versus
dow.
in
following
the
rationale
of
hurtado
versus
california,
maxwell
versus
dow
applied
the
test
of
fundamental
fairness
to
determine
that
due
process
required
neither
an
indictment
nor
a
jury
trial
in
state
prosecutions
for
robbery.
this
is
the
same
test
which
is
applied
by
this
court
today,
and
that
is,
is
the
right
which
has
been
denied
essential
to
a
fair
trial
which
is
inherent
in
due
process.
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
that
failure
to
a
court
appellant
a
jury
trial
necessarily
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
neither
logic
nor
history
supports
a
holding
that
failure
to
a
court
appellant
a
jury
trial
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
declaring
that
a
judge
cannot
dispense
with
the
same
fairness
and
impartiality
which
could
be
expected
of
a
jury
acting
under
a
judge's
instructions
both
as
to
the
law
and
the
facts.
certainly,
it
can't
be
logically
argued
that
it
was
fair
in
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans
for
federal
judge
without
a
jury
to
impose
a
60-day
sentence
on
the
accused
for
selling
property
without
a
license,
but
that
it
was
not
fair
in
the
case
at
bar
for
a
state
judge
without
a
jury
to
impose
a
60-day
sentence
for
simple
battery.
certainly
it
can
not
be
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
desirability.
desirability
is
not
a
case
for
constitutional
mandate.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
and
the
judge
has
a
traditional
role
to
play
in
that
of
a
fact
finder.
judges
find
facts
all
the
time
in
equity
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
our
point
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
--
you're
talking
about
sixth
amendment,
i'm
talking
fourteenth
and
i'm
talking
fairness
under
the
fourteenth.
you're
talking
sixth
amendment
which
applies
only
to
the
federal
courts.
and
i'm
talking
fairness
under
the
fourteenth.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor,
magna
carta
did
not
guarantee
jury
trial
to
anybody.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
under
magna
carta,
the
citizen
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
either
judgment
of
peers
or
the
law
of
the
land.
now
this
meant
that
parliament
had
the
right
by
positive
law
to
diminish
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
for
specific
offenses.
parliament
used
this
right
extensively
by
providing
for
the
summary
disposition
of
many
different
offenses
without
juries.
the
english
tradition
of
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
and
the
law
of
the
land
too.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
your
honor
they
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
it's
variable.
we
don't
deny.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we
don't
deny
the
value
of
jury
trial.
we
just
say
that
it
may
be
variable,
but
it
is
not
essential.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh
no,
indeed!
after
all,
we
provide
for
more
serious
offenses.
so
we
couldn't
deny
the
value.
we
just
say
the
value
and
desirability
is
not
constitutional
mandate.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
is
not
essential
to
the
holding
of
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i'm
saying
that
possibly
history
could
give
you
an
apt,
because
as
a
practical
matter,
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
history,
i
can't
think
of
many
capital
crimes
that
have
ever
been
tried
without
jury.
but
this
is
not
so
in
offenses
of
a
less
serious
nature
like
simple
battery.
and
as
i'm
trying
to
explain
to
you,
the
english
tradition
under
the
magna
carta
of
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
existing
side
by
side
with
legislative
power
to
provide
summary,
non-jury
process
for
a
specific
offenses
was
brought
from
england
and
adopted
by
the
colonies,
and
used
whenever
the
circumstances
called
for
it.
in
the
years
before
the
adoption
of
the
sixth
amendment,
almost
on
more
than
half
the
colonies
had
constitutions
of
the
magna
carta
type.
and
they
interpreted
this
language
as
allowing
legislative
diminution
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
moreover,
the
1780
constitution
of
massachusetts
and
the
1784
constitution
of
new
hampshire
allowed
a
trial
by
jury
to
capital
or
infamous
offense.
i
see
the
red
light
is
on,
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
wolbrette.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
exceedingly
simple.
the
simple
facts
as
shown
by
the
record
make
it
clear
that
appellant
who
was
19
years
old,
even
according
to
his
own
testimony,
made
an
intentional
bodily
contact
on
the
victim
who
was
14
years
old
without
his
consent.
the
simple
facts
of
this
case
show
that
the
appellant
committed
a
simple
battery
of
misdemeanor.
that
he
was
given
a
fair
trial
and
that
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
the
parish
jail,
and
a
$150.00
fine.
the
60-day
sentence
for
a
simple
battery
brings
this
case
squarely
under
this
court's
decision
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg,
if
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
applies
to
the
states.
cheff
held
that
the
imposition
of
an
actual
sentence
of
six
months
or
less
is
constitutionally
permissible
under
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment
without
a
trial
by
jury
if
the
inherent
nature
of
the
offense
charged
is
that
of
a
petty
offense
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
answers
your
question
about
the
federal
system.
it
would
have
to
be
a
serious,
i
mean,
it
would
have
to
be
a
petty
--
the
nature
of
the
offense
would
have
to
be
petty.
therefore,
it
could
not
involve
any
crime
in
a
federal
system
with
more
than
a
year
penalty
because
if
you
have
more
than
a
year
penalty,
you
go
to
the
federal
--
you
may
go
to
the
federal
penitentiary
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
an
infamous
offense
in
the
federal
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that's
what
cheff
said.
i'm
not
saying
it,
cheff
said
it.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
your
honor
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
no
difference
your
honor,
as
between
contempt
and
other
crimes
there
are
crimes
with
indefinite
sentences.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i'm
not
saying
it
this
is
what
cheff
held.
i'm
telling
you
what
cheff
held.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
any
crime
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
the
rule
which
cheff
put
up
is
what
you
just
said.
now
new
york
does
this
very
thing
and
so
does
everyone
(voice
overlap)
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
i
am
merely
stating
to
you
what
this
court
in
its
latest
decision
on
this
particular
point
held
and
that's
cheff.
this
is
exactly
what
cheff
held.
and
as
i
started
to
point
out
to
you,
new
york
uses
this
very
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
for
its
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
new
york
doesn't
think
so
and
england
doesn't
think
so.
england
uses
this
very
system
for
simple
batteries.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
they
use
it
to
determine
--
what
happens
is,
you
go
into
the
inferior
court,
the
judge
listens
to
some
of
the
testimony.
if
he
decides
it
from
the
circumstances,
in
his
opinion
it's
a
more
serious
offense
than
should
be
tried
summarily
without
a
jury.
he
then
sends
it
out
to
a
higher
court
where
he's
tried
by
indictment
with
the
jury.
that's
the
system.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
in
the
paris
jail,
of
course.
how
can
i
deny
it?
that's
the
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
six
months,
that's
the
test
which
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
your
honor,
cheff
did
not
consider
the
potential
sentence
at
all.
the
penalty
for
criminal
contempt
in
the
federal
courts
is
unlimited.
and
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent
in
cheff,
federal
courts
have
been
known
to
give
sentences
for
criminal
contempt
as
long
as
four
years.
so
you
had
the
same
problem
there.
now
under
cheff,
my
appreciation
of
the
â€“
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
yes
sir
we
do.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
he
would
not
have
determined
guilt
at
that
point
and
it
wouldn't
be
double
jeopardy.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
we
obviously
haven't
reached
that
problem
yet.
but
i'm
sure
if
we
did,
i
believe
that
the
court
would
say
that
this
is
not
what
is
determined
to
be
double
jeopardy.
i'm
sure
new
york
has
solved
that
problem.
now
under
cheff,
the
test
recognized
that
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
frankly
your
honor,
i
haven't
researched
that
point.
i'm
sure
that
new
york
has
met
that
problem
because
that
is
the
system
that
they
use
if
we
will
refer
to
the
amicus
brief
of
new
york
you
will
see
that
this
is
what
new
york
uses.
and
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
some
cases
then
in
new
york
state.
and
if
you
want,
i'll
submit
you
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
particular
point,
but
you're
asking
me
something
that
i
haven't
really
researched.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
now
under
cheff,
the
test
recognized
for
determining
of
petty
offense
are
one,
the
actual
sentence
imposed
is
six
months
or
less
and
two,
the
character
of
the
offense
charged
must
be
petty.
this
prosecution
meets
both
tests
of
cheff
because
the
sentence
actually
imposed
was
60
days
and
the
offense
charged
simple
battery
as
defined
in
louisiana
is
a
petty
offense.
simple
battery
in
louisiana
is
the
intentional
use
of
force
of
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
without
the
consent
of
the
victim,
and
without
a
dangerous
weapon.
intent
to
injure,
actual
bodily
injury
and
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
are
not
elements
of
simple
battery.
consent
to
the
victim
is
a
defense
so
that
the
identical
conduct
with
the
victim's
consent
is
not
a
crime
in
louisiana.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
of
course.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
mean,
i
would
not
argue
that
i
fit
it
under
cheff
now.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what
would
i
put
my
argument
on?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
of
course
i'm
going
--
then
i
would
go
into
my
--
oh!
i
know
what
you're
talking
about.
then
you're
talking
about
with
the
two-year
maximum
potential
penalty,
if
it
was
seven
months,
would
the
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
with
my
two-year
maximum
penalty
of
my
statute
then
deprive
him
of
due
process,
or
would
it
require
a
jury.
and
of
course
it
would
not,
because
you're
not
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no.
it
would
not
require
a
jury,
certainly
not.
the
potential
maximum
sentence
of
two
months
would
not
require
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
my
position
would
be
i
would
not
be
under
cheff,
because
the
actual
sentence
would
be
more
than
six
months
but
my
position
would
be,
that
he
would
still
not
require
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
then
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
maximum.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
i
skipped
a
step
on
it.
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
maximum.
well
in
addition
to
many
other
factors
i'd
have
to
look
at
the
inherent
nature
of
the
offense,
but
i
would
also
look
at
the
maximum
potential
sentence.
now
as
pointed
out
by
frankfurter
&
corcoran
in
their
article
which
has
been
cited
by
this
court
and
recognized,
there

well,
it
is
certainly
recognized
as
an
authoritative
work
on
what
is
a
serious
crime,
what
was
a
serious
crime
at

the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
sixth
amendment.
for
example,
they
point
out
that

that

don't
think

put

i
don't
recall
that
one.
new
york,
three
years
for
vagrancy
was
cited
in
the
clawans
case.
so
i
say
that
even
if
you
look
at
the
maximum
potential
penalty,
our
man
still
does
not
require
a
jury
trial.
he
does
not
go
to
the
penitentiary.
he
goes
to
the
parish
jail
which
is
a
substantial
difference.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
a
lot
of
difference.
you
have
civil
disabilities
for
one
thing
that
result
when
you're
convicted
of
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what's
that?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
at
hard
labor,
what
are
the
differences?
it's
the
difference
in
treatment
and
the
difference
in
hard
labor
that
things
that
a
person
has
to
do.
and
it
is
certainly
a
more
disgraceful
thing
to
go
to
the
penitentiary
considered
that
way
in
a
community
than
to
be
sentenced
to
parish
jail.
may
i
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh
no
sir!
that
is
absolutely
wrong.
that
is
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
section
34.1
of
the
louisiana
criminal
code.
now
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
is
not
a
misdemeanor,
it
is
a
felony.
the
source
act
of
section
34.1
is
act
69
of
1960
and
under
that
act,
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
is
a
felony.
it
is
not
a
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we've
never
had
a
prosecution
under
it.
but
as
a
felony,
it
would
have
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we've
had
aggravated
battery
as
defined
in
section
34
which
is
general
type
of
aggravated
battery,
but
we
have
never
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
ten
years.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
and
that's
trial
by
jury,
of
course.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
yes,
you
asked
about
the
one
-
i'm
sorry
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
one
that
he
referred
to
as
a
misdemeanor.
there
are
two
aggravated
batteries.
there's
section
34
which
is
aggravated
battery
which
requires
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
and
then
there's
34.1
which
is
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
breach
of
the
peace
which
requires
bodily
injury
and
they
are
both
felonies.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
is
incorrect
because
the
source
act
is
section
is
act
69
of
1960.
and
the
source
act
provides
that
it
is
--
that
that
particular
crime
is
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
but
it's
a
felony.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh!
definitely
it
is
a
felony,
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
generally,
yes.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
this
is
an
exception,
because
it
specifically
provides
that
it
is
a
felony
in
the
source
act.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
the
maximum
--
that
is
not
a
felony?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
there's
one
for
three
years
which
is
wearing
a
hood
in
the
streets
except
on
mardi
gras.
[laughter]
it
takes
three
years
and
it's
a
misdemeanor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
nothing,
nothing.[laughter]
your
party
said
you
don't
wear
one
on
mardi
gras.
your
honor,
we
say
that
simple
battery
is
a
trivial
offense
enacted
under
the
state's
police
power.
it's
not
too
offensive
to
the
community's
moral
purposes.
it's
not
too
close
to
society's
dangers
and
these
are
tests
which
have
been
used
by
this
court
in
determining
what
is
a
minor
offense.
we
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
simple
battery
or
misdemeanor
in
louisiana,
and
aggravated
battery
which
is
a
felony.
aggravated
battery
in
louisiana
involves
serious
conduct
and
as
a
felony,
it
is
triable
by
jury.
it's
punishable
in
the
penitentiary,
and
it
necessarily
involves
the
laws
of
important
civil
rights
such
as
the
right
to
vote.
simple
battery
involves
minor
conduct
and
of
course,
it's
a
misdemeanor.
and
the
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
does
not
involve
the
laws
of
any
civil
rights
at
all
and
it
is
not
punishable
in
the
penitentiary.
historically,
conduct
constituting
simple
battery
has
been
treated
as
a
petty
offense,
not
only
in
louisiana,
but
also
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
england
as
authorities
in
our
brief
show.
the
frankfurter
&
corcoran
article
which
was
cited,
in
the
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans
mentions
assault
and
battery
as
a
petty
offense
triable
without
a
jury.
throughout
the
united
states,
simple
battery
is
a
typical
petty
offense
as
our
brief
shows.
in
england,
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
adopted,
simple
battery
was
a
minor
offense
triable
without
indictment
and
without
a
jury,
as
our
brief
demonstrates.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
arguing
that
that
is
one
of
the
important
factors.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
the
court
has
looked
at
the
maximum
potential
sentence
and
that
has
been
modified
in
cheff
by
saying
that
when
the
actual
sentence
is
six
months
or
less.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
am
saying
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far.
the
only
point
to
which
the
court
has
to
go
on
this
case
is
the
two-year
maximum.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
as
pointed
out
in
d.c.
versus
clawans,
there
was
a
three-year
maximum
penalty
for
vagrancy
in
new
york.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
really
couldn't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i've
just
considered
really
two
years
and
possibly
three
years.
i
don't
know
of
that
five
years.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
tried
to
apply
--
go
ahead.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i'm
saying
that
the
state
may
modify
the
scope
of
jury
trial
and
that
louisiana
has
modified
the
scope
of
jury
trial
within
whatever
limits
maybe
provided
by
the
constitution.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
the
question
there
would
--
it
takes
two
parts.
could
a
judge
try
a
capital
offense
fairly?
yes
he
could.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
your
honor,
louisiana
provides
for
the
trial
of
a
capital
case
with
a
jury.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well
i
tried
to
answer
you
but
you
said
that
that
wasn't
the
answer.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i
said
that
the
test
is
a
fair
trial.
now,
can
a
judge
give
a
fair
trial
in
a
murder
case?
then
i
say,
of
course
a
judge
can
give
a
fair
trial
in
a
murder
case.
now
of
course,
if
you
want
to
look
at
history,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
precedent
for
a
capital
crime
being
tried
or
not
much
precedent
for
a
capital
crime
being
tried
without
a
jury.
so
on
the
basis
of
history
it
is
quite
possible
that
we
could
say
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
try
without
a
jury.
but
i'm
saying
that
a
state
has
the
right
to
modify
the
scope
of
jury
trial
as
louisiana
has
done
in
this
case.
i'm
also
saying
that
because
the
decision
of
the
decision
in
cheff,
this
court
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
hopefully
will
decide
this
case
on
the
narrower
ground
that
appellant's
prosecution
was
for
a
petty
offense,
which
is
exempted
from
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
under
the
cheff
decision.
but
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
deems
it
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
of
applicability
to
the
states
of
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right,
then
we
maintain
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states.
in
deciding
this
issue,
we
call
this
court's
attention
to
patton
versus
the
united
states
and
the
consequences
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
requiring
all
the
states
to
try
crimes
by
12-man
unanimous
jurors.
this
would
be
a
necessary
incident
of
a
crime
with
sixth
amendment
directly
to
the
states.
since
the
barron
decision
in
1833,
this
court
has
held
in
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
that
the
bill
of
rights
applies
only
against
the
federal
government
and
not
against
states.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
are
those
changed
--
are
those?
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that's
right.
but
what
i'm
pointing
at,
i'm
going
from
general
to
specific
if
you
will
allow
me.
the
fact
that
certain
rights
have
been
found
fundamental
and
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
mean
that
all
are.
the
fact
that
certain
restrictions
are
placed
on
the
federal
courts
does
not
mean
that
the
same
restrictions
must
be
imposed
on
state
courts.
unlike
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
is
not
an
abstract
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
based
on
fundamental
fairness.
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
deals
only
with
the
preservation
of
a
concrete
institution,
the
common
law
12-man
jury
as
it
existed
in
1787.
under
the
sixth
amendment
change
in
the
common
law
jury
is
impossible.
it
isn't
reasonable
to
argue
that
such
a
rigid
unchangeable
institution
as
the
18th
century
common
law
jury
in
which
procedural
reform
is
impossible
represents
a
fundamental
right
which
is
necessary
to
a
fair
trial
in
state
court.
jury
trial
exists
in
federal
court
by
reason
of
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment.
jury
trial
exists
in
state
court
by
reason
of
state
law.
the
only
vehicle
for
applying
the
federal
jury
trial
right
to
the
states
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
due
process
does
not
demand
trial
by
jury.
the
test
under
due
process
is
whether
a
jury
is
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
contrary
to
appellant's
arguments,
recent
decisions
of
this
court
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
what
kind
of
trial
would
it
be?
as
i
say
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no,
no
i'm
saying
that
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
no
sir,
i'm
saying
that
the
only
test
under
due
process
is
whether
a
jury
trial
is
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh,
you
mean
in
any
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
in
any
case
as
far
as
a
fair
trial
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
a
judge
certainly
can
try
any
defendant
fairly.
contrary
to
appellant's
argument,
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
undermined
the
validity
of
maxwell
versus
dow.
in
following
the
rationale
of
hurtado
versus
california,
maxwell
versus
dow
applied
the
test
of
fundamental
fairness
to
determine
that
due
process
required
neither
an
indictment
nor
a
jury
trial
in
state
prosecutions
for
robbery.
this
is
the
same
test
which
is
applied
by
this
court
today,
and
that
is,
is
the
right
which
has
been
denied
essential
to
a
fair
trial
which
is
inherent
in
due
process.
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
that
failure
to
a
court
appellant
a
jury
trial
necessarily
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
neither
logic
nor
history
supports
a
holding
that
failure
to
a
court
appellant
a
jury
trial
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
declaring
that
a
judge
cannot
dispense
with
the
same
fairness
and
impartiality
which
could
be
expected
of
a
jury
acting
under
a
judge's
instructions
both
as
to
the
law
and
the
facts.
certainly,
it
can't
be
logically
argued
that
it
was
fair
in
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans
for
federal
judge
without
a
jury
to
impose
a
60-day
sentence
on
the
accused
for
selling
property
without
a
license,
but
that
it
was
not
fair
in
the
case
at
bar
for
a
state
judge
without
a
jury
to
impose
a
60-day
sentence
for
simple
battery.
certainly
it
can
not
be
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
desirability.
desirability
is
not
a
case
for
constitutional
mandate.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
well,
and
the
judge
has
a
traditional
role
to
play
in
that
of
a
fact
finder.
judges
find
facts
all
the
time
in
equity
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
but
our
point
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
--
you're
talking
about
sixth
amendment,
i'm
talking
fourteenth
and
i'm
talking
fairness
under
the
fourteenth.
you're
talking
sixth
amendment
which
applies
only
to
the
federal
courts.
and
i'm
talking
fairness
under
the
fourteenth.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor,
magna
carta
did
not
guarantee
jury
trial
to
anybody.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
under
magna
carta,
the
citizen
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
either
judgment
of
peers
or
the
law
of
the
land.
now
this
meant
that
parliament
had
the
right
by
positive
law
to
diminish
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
for
specific
offenses.
parliament
used
this
right
extensively
by
providing
for
the
summary
disposition
of
many
different
offenses
without
juries.
the
english
tradition
of
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
and
the
law
of
the
land
too.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
your
honor
they
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
it's
variable.
we
don't
deny.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
we
don't
deny
the
value
of
jury
trial.
we
just
say
that
it
may
be
variable,
but
it
is
not
essential.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
oh
no,
indeed!
after
all,
we
provide
for
more
serious
offenses.
so
we
couldn't
deny
the
value.
we
just
say
the
value
and
desirability
is
not
constitutional
mandate.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
that
is
not
essential
to
the
holding
of
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
d.
wolbrette
i'm
saying
that
possibly
history
could
give
you
an
apt,
because
as
a
practical
matter,
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
history,
i
can't
think
of
many
capital
crimes
that
have
ever
been
tried
without
jury.
but
this
is
not
so
in
offenses
of
a
less
serious
nature
like
simple
battery.
and
as
i'm
trying
to
explain
to
you,
the
english
tradition
under
the
magna
carta
of
the
general
right
of
jury
trial
existing
side
by
side
with
legislative
power
to
provide
summary,
non-jury
process
for
a
specific
offenses
was
brought
from
england
and
adopted
by
the
colonies,
and
used
whenever
the
circumstances
called
for
it.
in
the
years
before
the
adoption
of
the
sixth
amendment,
almost
on
more
than
half
the
colonies
had
constitutions
of
the
magna
carta
type.
and
they
interpreted
this
language
as
allowing
legislative
diminution
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
moreover,
the
1780
constitution
of
massachusetts
and
the
1784
constitution
of
new
hampshire
allowed
a
trial
by
jury
to
capital
or
infamous
offense.
i
see
the
red
light
is
on,
thank
you.
