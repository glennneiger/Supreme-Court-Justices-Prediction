mr.
richard
b.
sobol
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
and
it
raises
the
issue
that
was
to
a
logic
stand
assumed
in
the
case
immediately
preceding,
namely
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
secures
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
state
criminal
proceedings.
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
charged
in
plaquemines
parish,
louisiana
with
the
crime
of
simple
battery,
which
is
defined
in
the
louisiana
code,
as
the
intentional
use
of
force
or
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
without
a
dangerous
weapon.
this
offense
in
louisiana
includes
all
batteries
other
than
those
committed
with
a
dangerous
weapon
and
is
punishable
by
two
years
imprisonment
without
hard
labor
and
a
$300.00
fine.
in
louisiana,
there
are
four
categories
of
crimes
for
purposes
of
trial
by
jury.
in
capital
cases
only,
a
jury
of
12
all
of
whom
must
concur
in
a
verdict
is
provided,
that
is
the
common
law
constitutional
jury.
in
cases
in
which
imprisonment
must
be
at
hard
labor,
a
12-man
jury
is
provided,
but
nine
jurors
are
sufficient
to
return
a
verdict.
in
cases
in
which
imprisonment
may
be
at
hard
labor,
a
five-man
jury
is
provided
and
included
in
that
category
are
such
serious
crimes
as
aggravated
criminal
damage
to
property
which
is
punishable
by
15
years,
aggravated
battery
punishable
by
10
years
in
forgery
punishable
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
it
must.
the
fourth
category
and
that
in
to
which
this
case
falls
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
no
sir.
each
criminal
provision
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
and
whether
it
says
may
be
at
hard
labor
or
must
be
at
hard
labor
would
determine
whether
it's
a
five-man
jury
unanimous
or
a
12-man
jury,
nine
of
whom
must
concur.
the
fourth
category
of
crimes
in
louisiana,
and
that
in
to
which
this
case
falls,
the
cases
in
which
no
provision
is
made
in
the
statute
for
hard
labor
and
the
constitution
of
louisiana
and
article
779
of
the
criminal
code
expressly
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
jury
in
such
cases.
and
that
category
includes
such
serious
crimes
as
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
the
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
punishable
by
10
years,
simple
battery,
the
crime
in
this
case
punishable
by
two
years,
and
aggravated
assault
punishable
two
years.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
under
a
charge
of
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
a
breach
of
the
peace,
i
should
make
clear
that's
not
this
case.
but
that
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
because
that
is
a
misdemeanor
in
louisiana
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
hard
labor.
that
is
the
division
and
i
want
to
call
that
point
of
the
court's
attention
because
there's
a
good
deal
of
use
of
the
word
“misdemeanor”
in
a
federal
constitutional
sense
as
if
it
means
something
when
of
course,
i
think
it's
clear
in
light
of
this
record
that
it
does
not.
that
the
inquiry
of
the
court
must
be
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
potential
maximum
imposed.
because
of
the
condition
of
louisiana
law,
therefore,
there
was
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
louisiana
law
on
the
charge
against
the
appellant.
but
not
withstanding
louisiana
law,
he
filed
a
demand
for
trial
by
jury
before
trial
basing
his
contention
on
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
united
states
constitution.
this
demand
was
rejected
by
the
trial
judge
expressly
on
the
ground
of
state
law
and
the
case
was
tried
to
a
judge.
witnesses
were
presented
on
both
sides;
four
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
three
witnesses
for
the
defense.
there
was
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
a
battery
had
been
committed.
the
judge
resolved
the
factual
dispute
in
favor
of
the
state
and
found
the
appellant
guilty.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
maximum
potential
sentence
is
two
years
and
a
$300.00
fine.
he
got
two
months
and
a
$150.00
fine
with
a
provision
that
if
the
fine
was
not
paid,
20
additional
days
would
be
added.
the
appellant
was
released
on
$1500.00
bond
pending
appellant
procedures
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
in
this
court.
an
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
refused
to
hear
the
case
holding
in
a
memorandum
opinion
appearing
on
page
14
of
the
record,
that
there
was
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
complained
of.
now
it
is,
of
course,
the
premise
of
appellant's
position
in
this
court
that
simple
battery
as
defined
under
louisiana
law
is
a
crime
and
not
a
petty
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
petty
offense
exception
to
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right.
we
think
this
point
is
quite
clear
but
appellee
takes
exception
and
argues
extensively
to
the
contrary,
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
deal
with
that
question.
the
court
has
it
seems
to
me
fashioned
three
independent
tests
for
the
determination
of
whether
a
charge
constitutes
a
crime
or
a
petty
offense.
and
there
are
clear
indications
in
the
cases
specifically
d.c.
against
colts,
and
d.c.
against
clawans
that
anyone
of
these
tests
being
satisfied
would
take
an
offense
into
the
crime
rather
than
the
petty
offense
category.
the
three
tests
alright,
it
seems
to
me
the
potential
maximum
sentence
and
i
think
cheff
against
schnackenberg,
and
d.c.
against
clawans
and
cheff's
reliance
on
18
u.s.c.
1
makes
clear
that
the
court
has
at
least
adapted
the
six-month
rule
on
that
question
and
has
indicated
that
any
offense
regardless
of
other
factors
where
the
potential
maximum
is
over
six
months
would
be
considered
a
crime
for
the
purpose
of
interpretation
of
a
sixth
amendment
jury
guarantee.
in
fact
i
think
the
question
is
left
open
by
d.c.
against
clawans
as
to
whether
that
maximum
may
not
be
somewhere
beneath
that.
in
clawans,
the
court
held
that
three
months
for
an
offense
that
was
clearly
otherwise
a
petty
offense
which
was
selling
unstamped
(inaudible),
that
they
said
three
months
is
not
free
from
doubt
as
to
whether
three
months
is
too
much
and
reserved
the
question
as
to
whether
any
more
than
that,
but
i
think
the
very
least
cheff
makes
clear
that
six
months
is
the
upper
most
maximum.
secondly,
the
court
has
referred
particularly
in
d.c.
against
colts
to
the
test
of
whether
the
crime
was
in
diabolic
common
law
and
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
the
common
law
authorities
and
our
main
brief
and
reply
brief
which
we
think
clearly
indicates
that
battery
was
an
indictable
offensive
at
common
law.
and
the
third
test
is
the
test
of
malum
in
se
interesting
for
malum
prohibitum
and
i
think
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
the
charge
of
intentionally
using
force
and
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
is
malum
is
a
crime
which
is
malum
in
se
within
the
meaning
of
that
term.
now
in
order
to
avoid
the
logic
and
i
think
the
inevitable
thrust
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
area,
the
appellee
has
argued
that
cheff
against
schnachenberg
has
abrogated
these
tests
and
instead,
has
created
a
test
which
looks
to
the
sentence
actually
imposed.
the
argument
essentially
is
the
appellant's
right
to
a
jury
trial
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
depends
on
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
in
response
to
that
let
me
say
that
cheff
was
an
expansion
of
the
jury
trial
right
without
meaning
to
get
into
the
controversy
of
the
preceding
cases
to
whether
that
was
a
constitutional
expansion
or
a
supervisory
power
expansion.
it
was
an
expansion
and
it
applied
to
jury
trial
right
to
an
area
where
it
had
not
previously
been
applied
by
the
court.
i
think
in
that
background,
it
is
hard
to
interpret
cheff
as
severely
contracting
the
jury
trial
right,
narrowing
the
jury
trial
right
in
all
non-contempt
cases
which
the
court
would
certainly
be
doing
if
it
substituted
the
prior
existing
test
for
one
that
looks
to
actual
sentence.
but
more
important
than
that,
i
think
there
was
a
practical
problem
in
cheff
that
induced
the
court
to
look
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
said
i
think
it
would
be
odd
to
interpret
cheff
where
the
court
went
further
and
applied
the
jury
trial
right
in
an
area
where
it
had
not
been
applied
before.
to
mean
that
in
the
non-contempt
area,
the
right
would
be
radically
constricted
because
a
test
that
looks
to
actual
sentence
imposed
is
one
which
would
provide
even
if
it
could
be
implemented,
jury
trial
in
thought
fewer
cases
than
a
test
based
on
the
maximum
potential.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
the
argument
of
the
appellee.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
secondly,
the
court
was
faced
with
a
practical
problem
in
cheff
and
that
there
is
no
potential
maximum
sentence
in
contempt
in
federal
courts.
and
that
if
the
rule
was
based
on
potential
maximum
sentence,
the
court
would
be
faced
with
a
situation
where
it
would
be
applying
the
jury
trial
the
right
to
every
contempt
no
matter
how
minor.
now
that
was
the
position
contended
for
by
some
members
of
the
court,
but
one
could
understand
why
the
court
would
want
to
not
reach
that
position
in
cheff.
i
think
the
practical
problem
is
very
important
there.
but
i
think
the
most
important
consideration
about
cheff
is
mechanically
the
rule
is
workable
in
the
contempt
situation,
because
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
issue
the
rule
to
show
cause
with
a
citation,
before
the
contempt,
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
begins
and
therefore,
has
occasion
to
determine
based
on
his
analysis
of
the
facts
presented
to
him
whether
there
is
a
likelihood
of
an
imposition
of
sentence
in
excess
of
six
months.
of
course
in
a
non-contempt
regular
criminal
trial
area,
there
is
no
occasion.
we
think
the
rule
in
cheff,
if
that
is
a
rule
that
could
not
possibly
work
in
any
other
area.
and
we
think
for
those
reasons,
cheff
is
not
applicable
to
the
determination
of
the
petty
offense
crime
question
in
this
case.
in
sum
we
think
that
on
the
basis
for
the
court's
decision,
this
case
is
clearly
a
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
as
to
state
criminal
proceedings,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
the
rule
we
are
contending
for
is
a
rule
that
would
apply
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
state
criminal
proceedings
in
its
full
force.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
no
category
of
petty
offenses.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
a
constitutional
category
of
petty
offenses
carved
out
by
this
court.
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
category
is
as
not
as
clear
cut
and
plain
as
it
might
be.
and
i
think
if
the
court
is
going
to
apply
the
jury
trial
rights
to
the
states,
the
court
is
obligated
to
make
plain
what
the
line
would
be.
and
i
would
propose
as
a
rule
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
court
seems
to
be
moving
to
in
cheff,
which
is
to
take
the
definition
in
18
u.s.c.
1.
and
it
perhaps
except
in
extraordinary
circumstance
where
an
offense
with
a
potential
less
than
six
months
might
for
some
reason
be
considered
a
crime,
say
that
anything
over
six
months
would
definitely
be
considered
a
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
we
can
assume
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
cheff,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
actual,
but
it
was
referring
to
the
petty
offense
definition
of
the
u.s.c.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
oh
i
think
a
test
based
on
actual
sentence
is
impossible.
i'm
talking
about
a
test
based
on
potential
maximum
sentence
for
the
crime
which
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
that's
the
position
we're
contending
for.
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
reservation
in
the
right
to
counsel
area,
which
i
think
presents
similar
practical
problems.
the
court
in
gideon
did
not
choose
to
make
plain
at
the
time
gideon
was
decided,
the
lower
most
reach
of
the
right
and
indeed,
the
court
has
declined
on
subsequent
occasions
to
make
that
determination
clear.
i'm
referring
to
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
winters
against
beck.
i
think
there
is
a
certain
advantage
to
that
procedure
in
an
area
where
the
court
is
not
fully
aware,
or
may
not
be
fully
aware
of
the
practical
problems
it
may
be
reaching.
judge
jones
in
the
connell
v.
moore
in
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
he
sees
the
logic
of
applying
the
right
to
counsel
on
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
and
i
think
if
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
and
i
think
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
on
that
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
i
look
at
the
issue
of
scope
of
the
decision
really
in
two
ways,
if
i
may
pursue
this
for
a
moment.
one
is
the
question
as
to
when
there
is
a
case
to
which
the
court
holds
the
sixth
amendment
jury
right
applies
whether
it
earmarks
the
jury
and
i
think
the
court
has
so
often
held
that
when
the
constitution
uses
the
word
jury,
it
means
a
certain
thing.
in
patten
against
the
united
states,
the
court
said
“an
11-man
jury
is
not
a
jury.
it's
just
the
same
as
no
jury
at
all.”
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
authority
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
for
the
proposition
that
a
jury
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution
and
we
are
asking
that
that
meaning
be
applied
to
the
states
mean
12-man
and
an
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
i
was
about
to
reach
that,
that's
true.
if
i
may
just
presume
it
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
point
one
step
further.
i
think
there
is
a
room
based
on
gideon
and
the
lower
court
treatment
of
gideon,
for
the
court
to
wait
until
a
misdemeanor,
by
that
i
mean
a
federal
misdemeanor,
less
than
a
year
comes
before
it
and
perhaps
at
that
time,
there
will
be
information
before
the
court
which
--
on
which
it
could
base
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
can
be
handled.
i
think
i
was
persuaded,
for
example,
by
a
comment
of
judge
jones
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
mcdonald
v.
moore
where
he
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
rule
applies
to
a
misdemeanor.
but
just
in
a
passing
observation,
he
said
frankly
he
doesn't
know
how
it's
going
to
work
because
in
his
hometown
of
jacksonville,
there
are
more
jp
courts
than
attorneys.
and
they
all
sit
on
monday
morning,
but
he
said
that
because
of
the
earmarks
of
that
particular
offense,
the
right
was
applied.
i
think
those
are
problems
the
court
obviously
has
to
think
about.
if
in
new
york
city
for
example
has
an
amicus
brief
before
the
court
in
this
case
on
this
point,
if
in
some
sense
mathematically,
a
jury
could
not
be
made
available
for
the
12,000
cases
that
were
tried
that
mr.
leftwood
refers
to,
i
would
think
the
court
would
want
to
consider
that
in
reaching
a
judgment.
in
sum,
i'm
saying
that
i
think
to
the
extent
there
is
room
to
--
for
caution
and
to
wait,
i
think
the
room
has
to
be
on
the
depths
or
how
farther
right
goes.
i
don't
think
based
on
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
the
jury
trial
right
in
this
case
and
the
court's
history
whenever
a
right
isn't
going
to
be
applied
to
the
state
that
it's
not
the
water
down
right
but
it
is
a
full
right.
that
it
means
whatever
the
federal
right
means,
i
don't
think
this
rule
applies.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
our
brief,
in
appendix
c,
we
make
to
a
point
that
until
1898
and
1899,
there
was
a
federal
12-man
unanimous
verdict
in
louisiana
in
every
case.
i'm
not
certain
about
that
date
it
maybe
1880.
but
for
a
good
substantial
period
after
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
we
made
that
presentation
to
dispel
whatever
weight
there
may
be
and
the
idea
that
this
is
an
unbroken
history
in
louisiana
of
reliance
on
the
civil
law
tradition.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
but
to
directly
answer
your
question
on
law,
i
don't
believe
i
affirmably
discount
it
but
i
do
discount
it.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
law
at
that
time
either
by
virtue
of
the
admitting
act
or
the
constitution
non-existing,
there
was
a
12-man
unanimous
verdict.
that
point
is
made
i
think
of
the
briefs
on
both
sides.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
imagine
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
oh,
yes
sir!
it
was
over
six
months.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
outermost
thrust
of
our
position.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
d.c.
against
colts,
the
court
held
with
a
30-day
maximum
that
this
court
held,
with
a
30-day
maximum
potential
penalty,
the
crime
was
so
serious
after
a
warrant
the
jury
trial,
but
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
the
idea
is
an
alternative
idea
which
is
reflected
very
clearly
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
which
would
not
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
that
is
the
reach
of
our
position,
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
definitely
not,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
that
i
think
with
the
precedent
of
the
right
to
counsel
case
at
gideon,
that
that
is
the
way
the
court
treated
it
there.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
wisdom
in
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
logic
of
our
position
because
i
think
that
the
court
and
the
common
law
has
placed
different
guarantees
in
connection
to
criminal
matters
than
to
civil
matters
has
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
our
position
in
this
case
certainly
does
not
involve
the
logic
that
the
seventh
amendment
necessarily
follows
and
nor
does
our
rationale.
we're
talking
and
i
mean
to
refer
that
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
court
has
said
recently
that
the
way
to
pick
and
choose
is
by
examining
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
right,
and
whether
it's
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
washington
v.
texas
and
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
where
in
discussing
the
incorporation
of
the
compulsory
process
provision,
the
court
did
say
that
without
implying,
i
don't
believe
that
every
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
applies
to
the
states
that
we
are
--
that
the
court
will
look
to
the
question
of
fundamentalness
and
essentiality
and
i
think
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
put
special
weight
on
the
criminal
trial.
i
think
that
while
there
is
great
weight
to
idea
that
what
the
court
has
done
so
far
in
the
criminal
procedure
area
in
incorporating
due
process
--
the
bill
of
rights
protections
may
well
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
criminal
procedures
are
incorporated,
which
is
not
necessarily
our
position
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
rule
in
civil
cases
could
well
be
different.
i
think
there
are
different
considerations
which
this
court
has
noted.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
none
says
that,
but
the
court
has
interpreted
the
words
due
process
in
connection
with
applying
bill
of
rights
guarantee.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
but
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
would
rely
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
looked
to
–
have
made
a
judgment
as
to
the
fundamentalness
and
the
essentiality
of
the
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
washington
against
texas,
pointer
v.
texas,
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
and
i
think
gideon.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
palko
and
twining
go
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
they
apply
the
same
test
and
they
apply--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
and
found
it
not
to
apply,
yes
sir
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
i
don't
believe
it
has
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
certainly
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
seventh
and
the
sixth.
and
i
think
there
is
--
that
is
the
one
example
which
i
think
the
distinction
is
the
greatest,
because
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
room
to
make
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
trials
in
applying
that
test
of
selectivity.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
i
do.
i
do.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
except
for
the
facts
of
case
your
honor,
i
think
the
opinion
certainly
indicates
that
the
court
has
made
that
assumption
that
the
jury
trial
right
of
the
sixth
amendment
does
apply
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
i
don't
--
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
court
needn't
have
reached
it,
but
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
court
said
both.
but
the
point
is
that
because
there
had
been
so
many
of
these
decisions
relating
to
the
impartiality
of
a
jury
without
referring
to
the
sixth
amendment
right.
the
use
of
that
language
i
think
could
be
interpreted
and
we
have
suggested
it
maybe
interpreted
to
have
applied
the
right.
i'd
like
to
just
pursue
a
matter
one
second
more
as
to
what
is
before
the
court.
i
do
think
the
question
of
a
12-man
jury
in
this
case
is
before
the
court,
because
of
the
condition
of
the
louisiana
law.
if
the
court
would
have
to
say
there
is
a
federal
jury
trial
right
in
this
case,
but
not
made
clear
what
right
the
court
is
referring
to
in
terms
of
the
scope,
the
12-man,
under
louisiana
law.
the
next
step
up
is
a
five-man
jury
and
the
case
will
be
coming
back
up
again.
and
i
think
that
if
the
appellant
were
to
be
convicted
again,
the
court
in
terms
of
a
remand
as
to
this
case,
i
think
should
make
clear
what
this
case
calls
for.
and
in
that
sense
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
you
have
to
set
them
aside.
no
sir.
i
think
the
retroactivity
cases
of
this
--
the
court
has
handed
down
or
in
several
recent
areas
would
indicate
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
room
not
to
apply
the
case
retroactively.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
court
in
stovell
and
in
the
johnson
v.
new
jersey
has
said
that
--
as
i
understand
those
decisions
that
because
the
right
that
it's
being
defined
does
not
go
to
the
central
core
of
the
fact
finding
process
the
right
need
not
be
applied.
i
do
want
to
say
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
think
it
does.
and
all
i
was
saying
in
response
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
marshall
in
a
manner
which
i
said
precedence
in
the
court
that
i
think
could
be
used,
i
believe
that
like
the
gideon
case
that
the
lack
of
jury
trial
is
central
to
the
fact
finding
process.
our
position
before
the
court,
mr.
justice
white
would
be,
that
because
it
is
central
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
because
some
practical
considerations
go
into
the
reach
of
the
rule
where
i
think
that
it
could
be
developed
before
the
court
that
the
question
would
not
involve
the
release
of
many
good
long
sentence
prison.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
reliance
to
the
number
of
settled
cases.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
considerations
here
is
certainly
after
the
cases
in
which
there
have
been
no
jury,
the
penalties
have
been
on
the
low
side
of
the
scale
and
you
don't
have
men
who've
been
tried
many,
many
years
ago
or
men
convicted
of
what
the
court
would
consider
very
heinous
crime
and
it
would
have
to
be
retried.
but
i
do
think
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white
and
can
i
clear
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
believe
that
the
logic
of
the
central
fact
finding
function
would
apply
here.
there
are
practical
considerations
which
i
think
the
court
should
meet
on
a
record
where
those
questions
are
fully
briefed
and
presented
to
the
court
as
it
has
in
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
except
in
capital
cases,
it's
12
with
a
nine
vote
where
hard
labor
must
be
imposed
with
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
would
involve
a
radical
change
in
louisiana
law
to
apply
the
12-man
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
would
take
unless
this
court
said
that
consistent
with
due
process
appellant
couldn't
be
tried
other
than
by
a
12-man
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
it's
indispensable
to
reaching
a
determination.
i
think
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
know
what
it's
required
to
do
to
meet
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
court.
and
i
wouldn't
argue
this
in
a
state
where
the
only
two
kinds
of
jury
when
no
jury
or
12-man
unanimous
jury
because
of
the
condition
of
louisiana
law,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
up
to
one
year.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
this
is
a
federal
court?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
louisiana,
there
aren't
too
many
segregation
--
desegregation
on
what
is
coming
out
of
state
courts
but
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right,
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
anything
in
our
case
would
indicate
that
result,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
meant
to
answer
that
way
sir.
i
don't
believe
the
reasoning
of
my
case
applies
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
because
i
think
the
question
of
the
court
has
struggled
with
in
the
contempt
cases
is
a
different
question
and
that
is
whether
a
contempt
is
a
crime.
and
without
expressing
any
opinion
on
that
and
i
think
it's
a
close
question,
i
don't
think
anything
we're
talking
about
involves
getting
into
that
question.
what
we
have
here
is
a
crime.
if
the
court
should
determine
in
the
bloom
case
that
contempt
is
a
crime
and
that
i
think
these
cases
have
to
be
fit
together.
i
have
to
win
first,
i
think,
except
for
your
honest
theory
of
return
of
theory
of
bloom
and
then
in
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
it
does
not
reach
criminal
contempt,
because
the
court
has
not
determined
whether
a
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
then
i
think
that
the
thrust
in
my
position
is
that
the
jury
trial
right
would
apply.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
unless
some
rule
was
fashioned
by
the
state
which
established
a
concept
of
petty
contempts
with
a
six
month
maximum
by
which
an
alternative
procedure
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
my
experience
is
they
have
all
been
civil.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't.
that
is
correct.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
and
it
raises
the
issue
that
was
to
a
logic
stand
assumed
in
the
case
immediately
preceding,
namely
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
secures
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
state
criminal
proceedings.
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
charged
in
plaquemines
parish,
louisiana
with
the
crime
of
simple
battery,
which
is
defined
in
the
louisiana
code,
as
the
intentional
use
of
force
or
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
without
a
dangerous
weapon.
this
offense
in
louisiana
includes
all
batteries
other
than
those
committed
with
a
dangerous
weapon
and
is
punishable
by
two
years
imprisonment
without
hard
labor
and
a
$300.00
fine.
in
louisiana,
there
are
four
categories
of
crimes
for
purposes
of
trial
by
jury.
in
capital
cases
only,
a
jury
of
12
all
of
whom
must
concur
in
a
verdict
is
provided,
that
is
the
common
law
constitutional
jury.
in
cases
in
which
imprisonment
must
be
at
hard
labor,
a
12-man
jury
is
provided,
but
nine
jurors
are
sufficient
to
return
a
verdict.
in
cases
in
which
imprisonment
may
be
at
hard
labor,
a
five-man
jury
is
provided
and
included
in
that
category
are
such
serious
crimes
as
aggravated
criminal
damage
to
property
which
is
punishable
by
15
years,
aggravated
battery
punishable
by
10
years
in
forgery
punishable
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
it
must.
the
fourth
category
and
that
in
to
which
this
case
falls
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
no
sir.
each
criminal
provision
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
and
whether
it
says
may
be
at
hard
labor
or
must
be
at
hard
labor
would
determine
whether
it's
a
five-man
jury
unanimous
or
a
12-man
jury,
nine
of
whom
must
concur.
the
fourth
category
of
crimes
in
louisiana,
and
that
in
to
which
this
case
falls,
the
cases
in
which
no
provision
is
made
in
the
statute
for
hard
labor
and
the
constitution
of
louisiana
and
article
779
of
the
criminal
code
expressly
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
jury
in
such
cases.
and
that
category
includes
such
serious
crimes
as
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
the
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
punishable
by
10
years,
simple
battery,
the
crime
in
this
case
punishable
by
two
years,
and
aggravated
assault
punishable
two
years.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
under
a
charge
of
aggravated
battery
resulting
from
a
breach
of
the
peace,
i
should
make
clear
that's
not
this
case.
but
that
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
because
that
is
a
misdemeanor
in
louisiana
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
hard
labor.
that
is
the
division
and
i
want
to
call
that
point
of
the
court's
attention
because
there's
a
good
deal
of
use
of
the
word
“misdemeanor”
in
a
federal
constitutional
sense
as
if
it
means
something
when
of
course,
i
think
it's
clear
in
light
of
this
record
that
it
does
not.
that
the
inquiry
of
the
court
must
be
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
potential
maximum
imposed.
because
of
the
condition
of
louisiana
law,
therefore,
there
was
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
louisiana
law
on
the
charge
against
the
appellant.
but
not
withstanding
louisiana
law,
he
filed
a
demand
for
trial
by
jury
before
trial
basing
his
contention
on
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
united
states
constitution.
this
demand
was
rejected
by
the
trial
judge
expressly
on
the
ground
of
state
law
and
the
case
was
tried
to
a
judge.
witnesses
were
presented
on
both
sides;
four
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
three
witnesses
for
the
defense.
there
was
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
a
battery
had
been
committed.
the
judge
resolved
the
factual
dispute
in
favor
of
the
state
and
found
the
appellant
guilty.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
maximum
potential
sentence
is
two
years
and
a
$300.00
fine.
he
got
two
months
and
a
$150.00
fine
with
a
provision
that
if
the
fine
was
not
paid,
20
additional
days
would
be
added.
the
appellant
was
released
on
$1500.00
bond
pending
appellant
procedures
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
in
this
court.
an
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
refused
to
hear
the
case
holding
in
a
memorandum
opinion
appearing
on
page
14
of
the
record,
that
there
was
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
complained
of.
now
it
is,
of
course,
the
premise
of
appellant's
position
in
this
court
that
simple
battery
as
defined
under
louisiana
law
is
a
crime
and
not
a
petty
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
petty
offense
exception
to
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right.
we
think
this
point
is
quite
clear
but
appellee
takes
exception
and
argues
extensively
to
the
contrary,
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
deal
with
that
question.
the
court
has
it
seems
to
me
fashioned
three
independent
tests
for
the
determination
of
whether
a
charge
constitutes
a
crime
or
a
petty
offense.
and
there
are
clear
indications
in
the
cases
specifically
d.c.
against
colts,
and
d.c.
against
clawans
that
anyone
of
these
tests
being
satisfied
would
take
an
offense
into
the
crime
rather
than
the
petty
offense
category.
the
three
tests
alright,
it
seems
to
me
the
potential
maximum
sentence
and
i
think
cheff
against
schnackenberg,
and
d.c.
against
clawans
and
cheff's
reliance
on
18
u.s.c.
1
makes
clear
that
the
court
has
at
least
adapted
the
six-month
rule
on
that
question
and
has
indicated
that
any
offense
regardless
of
other
factors
where
the
potential
maximum
is
over
six
months
would
be
considered
a
crime
for
the
purpose
of
interpretation
of
a
sixth
amendment
jury
guarantee.
in
fact
i
think
the
question
is
left
open
by
d.c.
against
clawans
as
to
whether
that
maximum
may
not
be
somewhere
beneath
that.
in
clawans,
the
court
held
that
three
months
for
an
offense
that
was
clearly
otherwise
a
petty
offense
which
was
selling
unstamped
(inaudible),
that
they
said
three
months
is
not
free
from
doubt
as
to
whether
three
months
is
too
much
and
reserved
the
question
as
to
whether
any
more
than
that,
but
i
think
the
very
least
cheff
makes
clear
that
six
months
is
the
upper
most
maximum.
secondly,
the
court
has
referred
particularly
in
d.c.
against
colts
to
the
test
of
whether
the
crime
was
in
diabolic
common
law
and
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
the
common
law
authorities
and
our
main
brief
and
reply
brief
which
we
think
clearly
indicates
that
battery
was
an
indictable
offensive
at
common
law.
and
the
third
test
is
the
test
of
malum
in
se
interesting
for
malum
prohibitum
and
i
think
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
the
charge
of
intentionally
using
force
and
violence
upon
the
person
of
another
is
malum
is
a
crime
which
is
malum
in
se
within
the
meaning
of
that
term.
now
in
order
to
avoid
the
logic
and
i
think
the
inevitable
thrust
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
area,
the
appellee
has
argued
that
cheff
against
schnachenberg
has
abrogated
these
tests
and
instead,
has
created
a
test
which
looks
to
the
sentence
actually
imposed.
the
argument
essentially
is
the
appellant's
right
to
a
jury
trial
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
depends
on
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
in
response
to
that
let
me
say
that
cheff
was
an
expansion
of
the
jury
trial
right
without
meaning
to
get
into
the
controversy
of
the
preceding
cases
to
whether
that
was
a
constitutional
expansion
or
a
supervisory
power
expansion.
it
was
an
expansion
and
it
applied
to
jury
trial
right
to
an
area
where
it
had
not
previously
been
applied
by
the
court.
i
think
in
that
background,
it
is
hard
to
interpret
cheff
as
severely
contracting
the
jury
trial
right,
narrowing
the
jury
trial
right
in
all
non-contempt
cases
which
the
court
would
certainly
be
doing
if
it
substituted
the
prior
existing
test
for
one
that
looks
to
actual
sentence.
but
more
important
than
that,
i
think
there
was
a
practical
problem
in
cheff
that
induced
the
court
to
look
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
said
i
think
it
would
be
odd
to
interpret
cheff
where
the
court
went
further
and
applied
the
jury
trial
right
in
an
area
where
it
had
not
been
applied
before.
to
mean
that
in
the
non-contempt
area,
the
right
would
be
radically
constricted
because
a
test
that
looks
to
actual
sentence
imposed
is
one
which
would
provide
even
if
it
could
be
implemented,
jury
trial
in
thought
fewer
cases
than
a
test
based
on
the
maximum
potential.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
the
argument
of
the
appellee.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
secondly,
the
court
was
faced
with
a
practical
problem
in
cheff
and
that
there
is
no
potential
maximum
sentence
in
contempt
in
federal
courts.
and
that
if
the
rule
was
based
on
potential
maximum
sentence,
the
court
would
be
faced
with
a
situation
where
it
would
be
applying
the
jury
trial
the
right
to
every
contempt
no
matter
how
minor.
now
that
was
the
position
contended
for
by
some
members
of
the
court,
but
one
could
understand
why
the
court
would
want
to
not
reach
that
position
in
cheff.
i
think
the
practical
problem
is
very
important
there.
but
i
think
the
most
important
consideration
about
cheff
is
mechanically
the
rule
is
workable
in
the
contempt
situation,
because
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
issue
the
rule
to
show
cause
with
a
citation,
before
the
contempt,
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
begins
and
therefore,
has
occasion
to
determine
based
on
his
analysis
of
the
facts
presented
to
him
whether
there
is
a
likelihood
of
an
imposition
of
sentence
in
excess
of
six
months.
of
course
in
a
non-contempt
regular
criminal
trial
area,
there
is
no
occasion.
we
think
the
rule
in
cheff,
if
that
is
a
rule
that
could
not
possibly
work
in
any
other
area.
and
we
think
for
those
reasons,
cheff
is
not
applicable
to
the
determination
of
the
petty
offense
crime
question
in
this
case.
in
sum
we
think
that
on
the
basis
for
the
court's
decision,
this
case
is
clearly
a
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
as
to
state
criminal
proceedings,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
the
rule
we
are
contending
for
is
a
rule
that
would
apply
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
state
criminal
proceedings
in
its
full
force.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
no
category
of
petty
offenses.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
a
constitutional
category
of
petty
offenses
carved
out
by
this
court.
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
category
is
as
not
as
clear
cut
and
plain
as
it
might
be.
and
i
think
if
the
court
is
going
to
apply
the
jury
trial
rights
to
the
states,
the
court
is
obligated
to
make
plain
what
the
line
would
be.
and
i
would
propose
as
a
rule
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
court
seems
to
be
moving
to
in
cheff,
which
is
to
take
the
definition
in
18
u.s.c.
1.
and
it
perhaps
except
in
extraordinary
circumstance
where
an
offense
with
a
potential
less
than
six
months
might
for
some
reason
be
considered
a
crime,
say
that
anything
over
six
months
would
definitely
be
considered
a
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
we
can
assume
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
cheff,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
actual,
but
it
was
referring
to
the
petty
offense
definition
of
the
u.s.c.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
oh
i
think
a
test
based
on
actual
sentence
is
impossible.
i'm
talking
about
a
test
based
on
potential
maximum
sentence
for
the
crime
which
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
your
honor,
that's
the
position
we're
contending
for.
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
reservation
in
the
right
to
counsel
area,
which
i
think
presents
similar
practical
problems.
the
court
in
gideon
did
not
choose
to
make
plain
at
the
time
gideon
was
decided,
the
lower
most
reach
of
the
right
and
indeed,
the
court
has
declined
on
subsequent
occasions
to
make
that
determination
clear.
i'm
referring
to
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
winters
against
beck.
i
think
there
is
a
certain
advantage
to
that
procedure
in
an
area
where
the
court
is
not
fully
aware,
or
may
not
be
fully
aware
of
the
practical
problems
it
may
be
reaching.
judge
jones
in
the
connell
v.
moore
in
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
he
sees
the
logic
of
applying
the
right
to
counsel
on
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
and
i
think
if
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
and
i
think
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
on
that
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
i
look
at
the
issue
of
scope
of
the
decision
really
in
two
ways,
if
i
may
pursue
this
for
a
moment.
one
is
the
question
as
to
when
there
is
a
case
to
which
the
court
holds
the
sixth
amendment
jury
right
applies
whether
it
earmarks
the
jury
and
i
think
the
court
has
so
often
held
that
when
the
constitution
uses
the
word
jury,
it
means
a
certain
thing.
in
patten
against
the
united
states,
the
court
said
“an
11-man
jury
is
not
a
jury.
it's
just
the
same
as
no
jury
at
all.”
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
authority
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
for
the
proposition
that
a
jury
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution
and
we
are
asking
that
that
meaning
be
applied
to
the
states
mean
12-man
and
an
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
i
was
about
to
reach
that,
that's
true.
if
i
may
just
presume
it
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
point
one
step
further.
i
think
there
is
a
room
based
on
gideon
and
the
lower
court
treatment
of
gideon,
for
the
court
to
wait
until
a
misdemeanor,
by
that
i
mean
a
federal
misdemeanor,
less
than
a
year
comes
before
it
and
perhaps
at
that
time,
there
will
be
information
before
the
court
which
--
on
which
it
could
base
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
can
be
handled.
i
think
i
was
persuaded,
for
example,
by
a
comment
of
judge
jones
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
mcdonald
v.
moore
where
he
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
rule
applies
to
a
misdemeanor.
but
just
in
a
passing
observation,
he
said
frankly
he
doesn't
know
how
it's
going
to
work
because
in
his
hometown
of
jacksonville,
there
are
more
jp
courts
than
attorneys.
and
they
all
sit
on
monday
morning,
but
he
said
that
because
of
the
earmarks
of
that
particular
offense,
the
right
was
applied.
i
think
those
are
problems
the
court
obviously
has
to
think
about.
if
in
new
york
city
for
example
has
an
amicus
brief
before
the
court
in
this
case
on
this
point,
if
in
some
sense
mathematically,
a
jury
could
not
be
made
available
for
the
12,000
cases
that
were
tried
that
mr.
leftwood
refers
to,
i
would
think
the
court
would
want
to
consider
that
in
reaching
a
judgment.
in
sum,
i'm
saying
that
i
think
to
the
extent
there
is
room
to
--
for
caution
and
to
wait,
i
think
the
room
has
to
be
on
the
depths
or
how
farther
right
goes.
i
don't
think
based
on
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
the
jury
trial
right
in
this
case
and
the
court's
history
whenever
a
right
isn't
going
to
be
applied
to
the
state
that
it's
not
the
water
down
right
but
it
is
a
full
right.
that
it
means
whatever
the
federal
right
means,
i
don't
think
this
rule
applies.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
our
brief,
in
appendix
c,
we
make
to
a
point
that
until
1898
and
1899,
there
was
a
federal
12-man
unanimous
verdict
in
louisiana
in
every
case.
i'm
not
certain
about
that
date
it
maybe
1880.
but
for
a
good
substantial
period
after
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
we
made
that
presentation
to
dispel
whatever
weight
there
may
be
and
the
idea
that
this
is
an
unbroken
history
in
louisiana
of
reliance
on
the
civil
law
tradition.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
but
to
directly
answer
your
question
on
law,
i
don't
believe
i
affirmably
discount
it
but
i
do
discount
it.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
law
at
that
time
either
by
virtue
of
the
admitting
act
or
the
constitution
non-existing,
there
was
a
12-man
unanimous
verdict.
that
point
is
made
i
think
of
the
briefs
on
both
sides.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
imagine
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
oh,
yes
sir!
it
was
over
six
months.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
outermost
thrust
of
our
position.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
d.c.
against
colts,
the
court
held
with
a
30-day
maximum
that
this
court
held,
with
a
30-day
maximum
potential
penalty,
the
crime
was
so
serious
after
a
warrant
the
jury
trial,
but
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
the
idea
is
an
alternative
idea
which
is
reflected
very
clearly
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
which
would
not
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
that
is
the
reach
of
our
position,
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
definitely
not,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
that
i
think
with
the
precedent
of
the
right
to
counsel
case
at
gideon,
that
that
is
the
way
the
court
treated
it
there.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
wisdom
in
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
logic
of
our
position
because
i
think
that
the
court
and
the
common
law
has
placed
different
guarantees
in
connection
to
criminal
matters
than
to
civil
matters
has
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
our
position
in
this
case
certainly
does
not
involve
the
logic
that
the
seventh
amendment
necessarily
follows
and
nor
does
our
rationale.
we're
talking
and
i
mean
to
refer
that
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
court
has
said
recently
that
the
way
to
pick
and
choose
is
by
examining
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
right,
and
whether
it's
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
washington
v.
texas
and
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
where
in
discussing
the
incorporation
of
the
compulsory
process
provision,
the
court
did
say
that
without
implying,
i
don't
believe
that
every
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
applies
to
the
states
that
we
are
--
that
the
court
will
look
to
the
question
of
fundamentalness
and
essentiality
and
i
think
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
put
special
weight
on
the
criminal
trial.
i
think
that
while
there
is
great
weight
to
idea
that
what
the
court
has
done
so
far
in
the
criminal
procedure
area
in
incorporating
due
process
--
the
bill
of
rights
protections
may
well
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
criminal
procedures
are
incorporated,
which
is
not
necessarily
our
position
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
rule
in
civil
cases
could
well
be
different.
i
think
there
are
different
considerations
which
this
court
has
noted.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
none
says
that,
but
the
court
has
interpreted
the
words
due
process
in
connection
with
applying
bill
of
rights
guarantee.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
but
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
would
rely
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
looked
to
–
have
made
a
judgment
as
to
the
fundamentalness
and
the
essentiality
of
the
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
washington
against
texas,
pointer
v.
texas,
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
and
i
think
gideon.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
palko
and
twining
go
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
they
apply
the
same
test
and
they
apply--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
and
found
it
not
to
apply,
yes
sir
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
i
don't
believe
it
has
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
certainly
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
seventh
and
the
sixth.
and
i
think
there
is
--
that
is
the
one
example
which
i
think
the
distinction
is
the
greatest,
because
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
room
to
make
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
trials
in
applying
that
test
of
selectivity.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
i
do.
i
do.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
except
for
the
facts
of
case
your
honor,
i
think
the
opinion
certainly
indicates
that
the
court
has
made
that
assumption
that
the
jury
trial
right
of
the
sixth
amendment
does
apply
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
i
don't
--
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
court
needn't
have
reached
it,
but
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
court
said
both.
but
the
point
is
that
because
there
had
been
so
many
of
these
decisions
relating
to
the
impartiality
of
a
jury
without
referring
to
the
sixth
amendment
right.
the
use
of
that
language
i
think
could
be
interpreted
and
we
have
suggested
it
maybe
interpreted
to
have
applied
the
right.
i'd
like
to
just
pursue
a
matter
one
second
more
as
to
what
is
before
the
court.
i
do
think
the
question
of
a
12-man
jury
in
this
case
is
before
the
court,
because
of
the
condition
of
the
louisiana
law.
if
the
court
would
have
to
say
there
is
a
federal
jury
trial
right
in
this
case,
but
not
made
clear
what
right
the
court
is
referring
to
in
terms
of
the
scope,
the
12-man,
under
louisiana
law.
the
next
step
up
is
a
five-man
jury
and
the
case
will
be
coming
back
up
again.
and
i
think
that
if
the
appellant
were
to
be
convicted
again,
the
court
in
terms
of
a
remand
as
to
this
case,
i
think
should
make
clear
what
this
case
calls
for.
and
in
that
sense
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
you
have
to
set
them
aside.
no
sir.
i
think
the
retroactivity
cases
of
this
--
the
court
has
handed
down
or
in
several
recent
areas
would
indicate
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
room
not
to
apply
the
case
retroactively.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
the
court
in
stovell
and
in
the
johnson
v.
new
jersey
has
said
that
--
as
i
understand
those
decisions
that
because
the
right
that
it's
being
defined
does
not
go
to
the
central
core
of
the
fact
finding
process
the
right
need
not
be
applied.
i
do
want
to
say
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
think
it
does.
and
all
i
was
saying
in
response
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
marshall
in
a
manner
which
i
said
precedence
in
the
court
that
i
think
could
be
used,
i
believe
that
like
the
gideon
case
that
the
lack
of
jury
trial
is
central
to
the
fact
finding
process.
our
position
before
the
court,
mr.
justice
white
would
be,
that
because
it
is
central
to
the
fact
finding
process
and
because
some
practical
considerations
go
into
the
reach
of
the
rule
where
i
think
that
it
could
be
developed
before
the
court
that
the
question
would
not
involve
the
release
of
many
good
long
sentence
prison.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
reliance
to
the
number
of
settled
cases.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
considerations
here
is
certainly
after
the
cases
in
which
there
have
been
no
jury,
the
penalties
have
been
on
the
low
side
of
the
scale
and
you
don't
have
men
who've
been
tried
many,
many
years
ago
or
men
convicted
of
what
the
court
would
consider
very
heinous
crime
and
it
would
have
to
be
retried.
but
i
do
think
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white
and
can
i
clear
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
believe
that
the
logic
of
the
central
fact
finding
function
would
apply
here.
there
are
practical
considerations
which
i
think
the
court
should
meet
on
a
record
where
those
questions
are
fully
briefed
and
presented
to
the
court
as
it
has
in
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
except
in
capital
cases,
it's
12
with
a
nine
vote
where
hard
labor
must
be
imposed
with
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
would
involve
a
radical
change
in
louisiana
law
to
apply
the
12-man
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
would
take
unless
this
court
said
that
consistent
with
due
process
appellant
couldn't
be
tried
other
than
by
a
12-man
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i
don't
think
it's
indispensable
to
reaching
a
determination.
i
think
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
know
what
it's
required
to
do
to
meet
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
court.
and
i
wouldn't
argue
this
in
a
state
where
the
only
two
kinds
of
jury
when
no
jury
or
12-man
unanimous
jury
because
of
the
condition
of
louisiana
law,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
up
to
one
year.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
this
is
a
federal
court?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
louisiana,
there
aren't
too
many
segregation
--
desegregation
on
what
is
coming
out
of
state
courts
but
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right,
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
anything
in
our
case
would
indicate
that
result,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
meant
to
answer
that
way
sir.
i
don't
believe
the
reasoning
of
my
case
applies
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
because
i
think
the
question
of
the
court
has
struggled
with
in
the
contempt
cases
is
a
different
question
and
that
is
whether
a
contempt
is
a
crime.
and
without
expressing
any
opinion
on
that
and
i
think
it's
a
close
question,
i
don't
think
anything
we're
talking
about
involves
getting
into
that
question.
what
we
have
here
is
a
crime.
if
the
court
should
determine
in
the
bloom
case
that
contempt
is
a
crime
and
that
i
think
these
cases
have
to
be
fit
together.
i
have
to
win
first,
i
think,
except
for
your
honest
theory
of
return
of
theory
of
bloom
and
then
in
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
it
does
not
reach
criminal
contempt,
because
the
court
has
not
determined
whether
a
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
then
i
think
that
the
thrust
in
my
position
is
that
the
jury
trial
right
would
apply.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
unless
some
rule
was
fashioned
by
the
state
which
established
a
concept
of
petty
contempts
with
a
six
month
maximum
by
which
an
alternative
procedure
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
my
experience
is
they
have
all
been
civil.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
i
don't.
that
is
correct.
thank
you,
sir.
