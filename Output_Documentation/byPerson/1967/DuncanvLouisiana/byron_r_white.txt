the

be

justice

except
there
was
a
confrontation
point
of
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
reach
the
jury
thing
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
relied
on
the
words
that
you
said
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
in
the
selective
approach
would
you
say
this
is
a
very
fundamental
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
trial,
it
doesn't
affect
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
come
your
argument
wouldn't
be
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
other
factors
in
the
retroactivity
case
besides
the
integrity
of
the
--
justice
byron

white
--
process,
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
sobol,
if
the
court
said
nothing
at
all
about
the
size
of
the
jury
whether
it
need
be
unanimous
or
not
and
simply
said
that
in
this
case
a
jury
trial
would
--
a
jury
trial
was
required?
there
are
other
cases
in
this
court
that
have
already
said
what
the
jury
has
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
only
reason
for
reaching
this
question
in
this
case
is
that
if
you
wanted
to
vary
from
the
old
cases
and
i
think
that
you
don't
want
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
decisions
anymore
unchangeable
than
the
ones
that
the
defendant
here
asked
us
to
overrule
about
the
applicability
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
courts
also
held
in
a
line
of
cases
that
the
jury
trial
provision
doesn't
apply
to
the
states
at
all.
