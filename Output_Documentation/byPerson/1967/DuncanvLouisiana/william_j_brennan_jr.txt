justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
gather
you
mean,
mr.
sobol,
that
would
have
to
be
in
the
federal
system.
that
in
fact
that
argument
would
mean
what
you
say
that
in
the
federal
system
no
matter
how
much
of
a
sentence
that
the
statute
has
permitted
a
maximum,
if
in
fact
the
sentence
imposed
was
something
less
than
six
months
and
then
there
was
no
right
to
jury
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
sobol,
may
i
ask
you,
i
take
at
this
case
presents
only
the
narrower
question
whether
an
offense
punishable
up
to
two
years
requires
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
to
decide
today.
in
this
case
at
least,
do
we,
that
that
means
a
12-man
jury
a
unanimous
verdict
that
all
offenses
carrying
more
than
six
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
to
reach
any
of
those,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
apply
the
selective
test,
didn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
palko
introduce
the
selective
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
some,
but
as
to
others
it
sound
it
did
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
has
the
court
done
anything
else
but
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
the
seventh
and
the
sixth
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
sobol,
do
you
get
any
comfort
now
on
the
issue
as
you
agreed
with
me
earlier
is
the
only
one
before
us
namely
whether
an
offense
that
carries
two-year
minimum
requires
a
jury
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
our
decision
last
term
in
parker
and
gladden?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
we
crossed
best
bridge
in
parker
and
gladden?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reliance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reliance
on
the
--
maxwell
and
dowd
and
the
other
cases
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
mr.
sobol
why
you
think
we
have
to
reach
the
12-man
jury.
as
i
understood
your
exposition
of
the
system,
i
gather
there's
a
12-man
jury
in
certain
types
of
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
a
12
with
a
nine
vote
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
there's
a
five-man
in
certain
category
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
there's
no
jury
with
the
crime
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
we
were
to
send
this
back
without
deciding,
well
what
the
number
should
be
on
the
jury,
how
are
we
to
know
that
louisiana
might
not
apply
the
12-man?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
wouldn't
it
require
--
i
know,
but
i
take
it
the
legislature
of
louisiana
would
have
then
to
make
up
its
mind
what
kind
of
jury
it
was
going
to
provide,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
take
a
legislative
action,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
appreciate
that
but
i'm
just
--
this
isn't
just
clear
to
me
why
we
have
to
reach
this
question
at
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
we
do
have
other
states,
mr.
sobol,
oklahoma
for
example
as
i
understand
from
these
appendixes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
a
five-man
jury
for
certain
types
of
offenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
six
whatever
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
a
three
quarter
vote
of
six,
i
think
that
means
five
out
of
six
or
something
and
there
are
other
states
too
that
have
these
things,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
contempt
of
a
segregation
order
a
criminal
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
how
far
your
argument
goes,
it
doesn't
reach
civil
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
gather
you
mean,
mr.
sobol,
that
would
have
to
be
in
the
federal
system.
that
in
fact
that
argument
would
mean
