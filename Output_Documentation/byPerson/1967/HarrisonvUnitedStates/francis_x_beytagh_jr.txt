mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
if
we
accept
the
premises
that
petitioner's
counsel
operates
on,
he
states
a
pretty
convincing
case.
but
i
think
we
have
to
step
back
and
look
at
really
what
he
is
saying
and
what
his
position
is.
he
makes
basically
two
constitutional
claims,
one
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
one
under
the
sixth.
his
fifth
amendment
claim
essentially
as
we
understand
it
is
that
petitioner
was
compelled
to
take
the
stand
at
a
second
trial.
that
violated
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
and
then
the
introduction
by
the
government
at
his
third
trial
of
that
testimony
which
had
been
compelled
violated
his
constitutional
right.
and
he
also
says
that
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
was
denied.
as
we
understand
it,
principally
because
of
delay
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
as
well
because
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
long
period
of
time
that
has
gone
on
here.
i'd
like
to
treat
first
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
claim.
petitioner
of
course
concedes
that
if
the
testimony
that
he
gave
at
his
second
trial
was
voluntarily
given
in
a
legal
sense
that
it
was
admissible
against
him
in
his
third
trial,
that
so
because
it's
an
admission
against
interest
under
accepted
legal
rules
what
would
be
probably
used
by
the
government.
but
he
says
that
that
testimony
was
not
freely
given.
he
says
it
was
not
freely
given
because
it
was
given
to
rebut
certain
confessions
that
had
been
introduced
and
were
later
held
to
have
been
improperly
introduced
against
him
at
that
second
trial.
he
states
that
a
little
bit
differently
when
he
talks
about
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
he
says
that
this
testimony
flowed
from
or
was
the
result
of
these
statements
that
later
were
held
to
have
been
improperly
admitted
and
that
therefore
his
testimony
was
the
fruit
of
that
illegality.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantial
difference.
i
think
it's
mainly
one
of
terminology.
you
do
have
some
different
cases
you
can
throw
in
and
different
analogies
you
can
draw,
but
i
think
in
substance,
the
claim
is
the
same.
but
we
start
at
a
somewhat
different
point
than
petitioner
does.
it
has
been
the
accepted
rule
that,
except
in
very
rare
instances
when
a
witness
takes
a
stand,
testifies
under
oath
that
what
he
says
is
accountable
for
and
it
can
be
used
against
him
in
any
appropriate
way
in
a
later
proceeding.
now,
he
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify
at
all
at
his
second
trial.
he
could
remain
silent
but
he
didn't
do
that.
under
ordinary
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
case
is
quite
clear
that
that
testimony
would
have
been
usable
and
admissible
for
any
relevant
purpose.
but
he
says
that
that's
not
so,
that
this
is
a
different
kind
of
case.
he
says
it's
a
different
kind
of
case
as
we
understand
it
because
statements
had
been
introduced
against
him,
which
were
later
held
had
been
improperly
introduced
and
that
that
triggered
his
taking
the
stand
and
therefore,
all
of
that
has
to
be
wiped
out.
the
government
can't
use
it.
the
matter
isn't
that
simple,
i
don't
think,
and
we
don't
maintain
that
it
is.
we
do
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
gave
extended
consideration
of
the
difficult
questions
involved
in
this
case
and
i
will
come
to
that
later
in
the
context
of
the
speedy
trial
claim.
i
think
that
their
analysis
is
as
pertinent
as
anything
that
i
could
say.
they
said
our
federal
system
bestows
upon
--
this
is
at
the
appendix,
page
75
--
our
federal
system
bestows
upon
accused
the
choice
of
testifying
or
not,
and
permits
what
he
says
in
the
witness
stand
to
be
used
against
him
coercively.
the
record
contains
no
suggestion
that
the
use
of
the
statements
of
the
second
trial
was
a
maneuver
to
ring
evidence
from
appellant.
from
what
it
appears,
the
government's
sole
objective
was
to
supply
missing
elements
in
its
case.
here
on
like
situations
were
duress
of
some
sort
has
been
found,
the
government
exerted
no
pressure
or
put
no
undisciplined
and
imposed
no
improper
condition
on
appellant's
right
to
mootness.
there
was
uninhibited
access
to
counsel
and
so
far
as
we
can
perceive,
complete
awareness
of
legal
rights.
we
have
been
referred
in
no
case
and
our
own
intensive
research
is
located
not
holding
that
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
is
itself
officiating
a
form
of
testimonial
compulsion.
now,
petitioner
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
yes?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
get
a
conviction.
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
very
slim.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
who
admits
that,
your
honor.
we
don't.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
his
argument.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
introduction
of
the
statements
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
his
taking
the
stand.
whether
they
produced
his
taking
the
stand
in
a
direct
causal
sense
i
think
is
another
and
a
difficult
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
at
all
to
show
that.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
was
not
so.
the
--
i
might
say
this
about
these
confessions.
i
think
this
is
quite
pertinent.
petitioner,
and
i
think
properly,
refers
to
them
as
having
been
illegally
obtained.
but
i
think
we
better
take
a
look
at
how
they
were
held
to
have
been
illegally
obtained.
petitioner
made
essentially
three
statements
that
were
introduced.
the
first
statement
was
taken
from
him
at
the
jail
where
he's
being
held
on
another
charge,
larceny
or
some
sort
of
charge.
it
was
taken
in
this
context.
white
and
samson,
the
other
alleged
co-defendants
have
made
statements
to
the
police
admitting
their
activity
in
regard
of
the
murder
of
syder
brown
and
implicating
petitioner.
those
statements
of
course
were
ultimately
held
to
have
been
improperly
obtained
in
violation
of
mallory
because
they
had
not
properly
been
brought
to
a
magistrate.
the
next
morning
after
the
statements
have
been
given,
white
and
samson
were
brought
down
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
there
was
another
statement
of
petitioner
that
came
after
this
oral
statement
that
was
also
thrown
out
on
mallory
but
that
was
a
substantial
restatement
of
what
he'd
said
at
the
jail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
that's
the
point
i'm
coming
to
this.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
his
oral
statement
given
at
the
jail
was
given
--
he
was
apprised
of
what
white
and
samson
had
said,
and
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say.
and
he
said,
“yes,”
--
it's
something
like
this.
i
don't
remember
the
exact
statement,
“i
might
as
well
tell
you,”
and
then
he
told
his
story.
now,
subsequently
that
story
was
reduced
to
a
written
statement
and
the
story
was
also
given
to
a
jail
classification
officer.
those
other
two
written
statements
were
held
inadmissible
under
mallory
and
killough.
but
this
first
statement
was
the
one
that
precipitated
the
en
banc
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
second
trial.
that
statement
was
held
inadmissible
eventually
by
a
six
to
four
vote
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
its
introduction
would
violate
the
rule
of
case
of
harling
versus
united
states.
that
case
essentially
had
held
that
where
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
had
not
yet
been
waived,
a
mistake
that
made
by
an
individual
being
held
on
a
charge
to
which
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
would
originally
attach
could
not
be
used
against
him.
now,
on
these
circumstances,
the
petitioner
had
been
10
days
short
of
18
years
old
when
the
alleged
felony
murder
occurred.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
as
i
understand
it,
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
probably
so.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right,
and
i
think
that
cuts
both
ways.
i
think
you're
quite
right.
but
for
whatever
it
is
worth,
these
illegally
obtained
statements
were
not
held
inadmissible
on
the
ground
that
they've
been
beaten
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
like
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'd
like
to
discuss
simmons
right
now.
we
think
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
significantly
different
than
the
one
in
the
simmons
case.
i
think
it
is
better
to
say
that
had
simmons
been
decided
differently,
the
question
here
would
be
easier
for
the
government,
but
it
was
not.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
very
pertinent
distinctions
between
the
situation
in
simmons,
as
you
may
recall.
simmons
involved
a
testimony
given
at
a
motion
to
suppress
a
hearing.
the
motion
to
suppress
was
unsuccessful
and
that
testimony
was
introduced
against
the
--
against
garret
actually
at
the
trial
and
was
quite
a
pertinent
evidence
of
his
connection
with
the
suitcase
and
its
contents.
now
there,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
there
were
two
constitutional
rights
involved,
one
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
right
to
be
free
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
one
under
the
fifth,
not
to
be
compelled
to
testify
against
one's
self.
here
as
we
see
it,
there's
one
right
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
pointed
out
in
simmons
that
defendants
might
be
deterred
from
taking
the
stand
at
a
motion
to
suppress
hearing
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
harling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
was
--
they
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
they
can
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
construed
harling
to
this
effect
that
even
if
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
had
not
yet
initially
attached
to
an
individual
being
held
and
they
had
not
had
the
opportunity
to
waive
it,
the
fact
that
he
was
under
18
at
the
time
he
committed
the
alleged
offense
was
sufficient
to
make
that
doctrine
applicable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it's
a
doctrine
that's
derived
from
the
construction
of
the
juvenile
court
statutes
in
the
district
of
columbia,
as
i
understand
it.
now,
getting
back
to
simmons
as
i
said,
the
court
there
pointed
out,
and
we
think
quite
significantly,
that
defendants
might
be
deterred
from
taking
the
stand
to
support
a
motion
to
suppress
if
they
knew
that
the
motion
to
suppress
was
unsuccessful.
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him.
the
court
pointed
out
that
while
the
jones
case
had
taken
care
of
a
large
number
of
these
kinds
of
situations
that
it
still
remained
that
there
were
marginal
cases
in
which
this
choice
would
be
a
difficult
one
to
make.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
here,
there's
no
question
of
a
surrender
of
one
constitutional
right
in
order
to
assert
another.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
simmons.
it
was
something
it
found
intolerable.
it
said
that
the
practical
effect
in
the
simmons
situation
was
to
require
an
individual
if
the
only
way
he
could
show
standing
and
therefore
an
ability
to
raise
his
fourth
amendment
claim
was
to
take
the
stand.
but
he
either
had
to
take
the
stand
and
run
the
risk
of
waiving
his
right
not
to
incriminate
if
he
wanted
to
assert
his
fourth
amendment
right.
we
think
there's
another
important
distinction
and
perhaps
the
most
important
one
between
the
simmons
situation
and
this
one.
in
our
view,
the
compulsion
which
petitioner
might
have
felt
to
testify
here
was
simply
not
dictated
by
any
requirement
that
made
his
testifying
the
only
way
it
would
raise
a
legal
issue.
in
simmons,
that
was
so.
if
--
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
if
he
accepted
the
premise
on
which
the
court
offered
in
simmons,
there
simply
wasn't
any
way
that
the
individual
could
make
this
claim.
he
had
a
show
of
standing
under
our
laws
as
it
presently
stands
and
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
by
definition
he
couldn't
show
that
and
therefore,
his
fourth
amendment
right
went
out
of
the
window.
this
isn't
so
here.
it's
quite
clear
that
in
order
to
protect
his
rights,
he
had
a
clear
and
available
way
to
raise
them
and
that
was
simply
by
objecting
as
he
did
to
the
introduction
of
these
statements
and
if
he
was
vindicated
upon
appeal
as
he
indeed
was.
now,
he
said
--
petitioner
says,
“well,
that's
all
well
and
good
but
that's
simply
no
real
alternative
to
me.”
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
we
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
more
difficult
to
make
because
the
next
is
in
the
continuity
of
alleged
violations
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
very
--
i'd
like
to
also
--
in
conclusion
on
simmons,
it
just
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
not
simmons
and
it's
not
controlled
by
simmons.
i'd
like
to
mention
griffin
versus
california
in
passing
because
that
case
was
relied
upon
by
judges
bazelon
and
wright
in
descending
from
a
rehearing
en
banc,
petition
denial
in
this
last
appeal.
it
seems
to
us
that
griffin
is
a
different
situation.
griffin,
as
i'm
sure
you
recall,
involved
a
question
of
whether
it
was
unconstitutional
to
make
adverse
comment
on
the
failure
to
take
a
stand.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there,
the
court
said
that
a
price
was
placed
upon
remaining
silent.
the
invocation
of
privilege
was
made
plausibly.
the
only
way
of
course
to
remedy
an
adverse
comment,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
is
simply
to
take
the
stand
because
that's
the
only
way
you
could
avoid
again
those
states
in
which
the
rule
applied
prior
to
griffin.
well,
here
it's
quite
plain
that
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
testified
at
the
second
trial
and
--
so
there's
no
question
about
adverse
comment
of
that
trial
on
his
failure
to
testify.
the
question
is
simply
whether
his
election
to
testify
was
voluntary
or
not.
the
advice
that
was
found
in
griffin
it
seems
to
us
was
that
there
simply
wasn't
any
way
to
avoid
this.
the
petitioner
had
a
way
to
avoid
it.
in
fact,
he
exercised
it
by
testifying.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
that
would
happen.
that
--
that's
one
of
the
claims
that
is
made
here,
your
honor.
under
the
federal
court,
it
says
that
the
scope
of
cross
is
limited
to
direct.
he
says
--
he
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
that
relates
to
--
but
the
reason
i
understand
it
where
prior
convictions
could
be
introduced
is
to
impeach
his
credibility
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
situation
you
posed
is
a
closer
one
to
the
simmons
situation.
i
think
the
argument
would
be
more
difficult.
the
same
argument
that
we
make
here
could
be
made,
of
course.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
why
isn't
it
this
situation?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
charge
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
you
have
to
differentiate
the
reasons
why
he
says
he
took
a
stand.
in
that
situation
that
you
posed,
you
said
that
he
had
to
take
the
stand
because
that
was
the
only
way
that
he
could
show
that
those
confessions
were
involuntary.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
here,
we
don't
have
a
serious
question
about
voluntariness.
it
is
asserted
by
petitioner
and
he
said
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
he
had
to
take
the
stand.
but
it
seems
to
me
on
that
point,
my
original
answer
is
it
remains
pertinent
that
while
his
prior
convictions
could
be
brought
out
to
impeach
him,
that's
so
as
to
anyone
who
takes
the
stand.
but
the
scope
of
cross-examination
would
have
been
limited,
if
that
was
his
problem,
to
matters
that
he
raised
non-direct.
and
if
he
testified
only
about
threats
and
abuse
and
whatever
and
didn't
affirmatively
testify
about
a
rather
different
subject
matter,
what
went
on
in
his
view
at
the
critical
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
could
not
be
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
thought
i
said
that
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
it
was
the
only
way,
the
question
of
voluntariness,
you
had
it
seems
to
me
a
different
situation
than
you
have
here
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
basic
claim
here
is
not
one
of
involuntariness
with
respect
to
the
statements
that
were
later
held.
it
have
been
legally
obtained
that
the
claim
was
a
--
as
i've
discussed
the
mallory
claim
and
this
harling
rationale.
one
thing
that
is
significant
to
us
is
that
petitioner
really
doesn't
attempt
to
deal
with
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
that
he
sticks
to
have
the
court
adopt
here
in
the
fifth
amendment
context.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
a
criminal
defendant's
decision,
whether
to
take
the
stand
or
not,
is
always
one
that's
under
some
strain
and
some
stress
and
that
only
one
of
the
risks
that
is
taken
is
that
the
testimony
might
be
used
against
him
at
retrial.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
petitioner
is
correct
in
his
basic
contention,
that
is
that
a
second
trial
testimony
was
compelled
involuntary,
then
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
as
a
logical
matter
why
that
sort
of
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
any
respect,
not
just
on
the
question
of
guilt
in
a
subsequent
trial.
now,
i
suppose
petitioner
would
say,
“well,
that's
not
right.
all
that
i'm
contending
for
here
is
that
it
can't
be
used
affirmatively
against
me
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
the
government
tries
to
use
it
to
impeach
if
i
do
take
the
stand.
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
i'm
later
prosecuted
for
perjury
and
the
government
tries
to
use
this
testimony.
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
the
government
uses
it
as
a
link
or
a
lead
or
whatever.”
well,
maybe
so,
but
you
have
to
work
a
little
bit
at
it,
it
seems
to
me,
to
destroy
the
consistency
that
seems
to
us
to
be
there.
i
would
like
in
the
remaining
moments
to
mention
just
one
more
thing,
first
on
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
it
seems
to
us
the
petitioner
really
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
he
wants
to
be
able
to
take
the
stand
and
he
wants
to
try
to
convince
the
jury
that
they
should
acquit
him.
in
which
case,
he
couldn't
be
retried
at
all,
of
course.
but
if
he
fails
on
that
but
prevails
on
his
objections
to
the
introduction
of
these
statements,
he
wants
it
to
be
assumed
that
he
never
took
the
stand
and
he
never
said
anything.
he
wants
the
slate
totally
wiped
clean.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
situation
were
analogous
to
simmons,
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
assert
a
right
to
have
these
inadmissible
statements
excluded
at
trial
and
if
he
couldn't
preserve
that
right
for
appellate
review
without
taking
the
stand,
then
i
think
he
should
prevail
under
simmons.
i
think
simmons
would
require
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
if
the
individual
was
in
the
courtroom,
would
it
be
necessary
to
call
him
rather
than
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
he
should
call
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
do
whatever
he
wanted
to
do,
to
take
the
stand
and
that
the
government
could
not
call
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
the
accepted
rule
but
some
people
have
questioned
that
rule.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
there
said
the
analogy
that
they
saw
was
that
of
any
extrajudicial
confession
or
statement,
that
if
it
was
voluntarily
made,
you
can
say
the
same
thing.
you
can
say
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
how
can
use
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
his
testimony?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
his
testimony
was
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
it
admitted
--
it
admitted
very
damaging
elements.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
but
we
don't
stick
to
really
on
that
because
this
court
has
said
that
when
--
that's
a
terminology.
if
they
want
to
use
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
said
that
--
he
said
that
he
was
--
he
placed
himself
at
the
scene
and
he
said
he
had
a
loaded
gun.
you
know,
i
think
that's
pretty
damaging.
the
jury
obviously
thought
it
was,
too,
coupled
with
the
other
evidence
and
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
was
trying
to
pawn
it,
he
said.
he'd
done
that
frequently
before
with
this
individual.
we
--
we
don't
accept
petitioner's
statement
that
--
and
i
should
mention
this
that
there
was
simply
no
other
evidence.
there
was
other
evidence
here.
he
made
an
admission
against
interest
that
said
that
he'd
done
it
to
somebody
else.
there
was
other
circumstantial
evidence
against
him,
the
trajectory
of
the
shot,
the
fact
that
the
man
had
a
lot
of
money,
they
were
seen
in
a
black
buick
just
previous
the
--
it
just
seems
to
us
that
the
question
presented
is
the
fifth
amendment
issue
and
i
haven't
sought
to
go
into
all
those
details.
i
just
like
to
touch
on
this
sixth
amendment
argument.
petitioner
spent
a
good
bit
of
time
on
it.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
i
don't
have
a
little
more
time,
but
i
just
like
to
say
this.
first,
we
understand
that
he
says
two
things
basically.
one,
this
is
just
too
long
and
you
can't
try
me
anymore.
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
the
circumstances.
the
court
--
this
court
has
never
held
that
through
the
exercise
of
legal
rights
through
appellate
review
and
obtaining
reversals
and
other
relief
that
the
individual
can't
be
tried
again.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
what
petitioner
really
tries
to
do
is
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
second-guess
the
reasons
why
they
had
problems
with
the
case.
i
think
that
as
we
point
out
if
one
thinks
about
and
looks
at
the
problems,
it's
a
very
complicated
matter
and
the
time
was
substantial.
we
don't
deny
that
and
i
don't
know
why
it
took
them
so
long,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
not
intolerable.
in
short,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
write
on
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
points
and
the
judgment
should
be
confirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
if
we
accept
the
premises
that
petitioner's
counsel
operates
on,
he
states
a
pretty
convincing
case.
but
i
think
we
have
to
step
back
and
look
at
really
what
he
is
saying
and
what
his
position
is.
he
makes
basically
two
constitutional
claims,
one
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
one
under
the
sixth.
his
fifth
amendment
claim
essentially
as
we
understand
it
is
that
petitioner
was
compelled
to
take
the
stand
at
a
second
trial.
that
violated
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
and
then
the
introduction
by
the
government
at
his
third
trial
of
that
testimony
which
had
been
compelled
violated
his
constitutional
right.
and
he
also
says
that
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
was
denied.
as
we
understand
it,
principally
because
of
delay
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
as
well
because
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
long
period
of
time
that
has
gone
on
here.
i'd
like
to
treat
first
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
claim.
petitioner
of
course
concedes
that
if
the
testimony
that
he
gave
at
his
second
trial
was
voluntarily
given
in
a
legal
sense
that
it
was
admissible
against
him
in
his
third
trial,
that
so
because
it's
an
admission
against
interest
under
accepted
legal
rules
what
would
be
probably
used
by
the
government.
but
he
says
that
that
testimony
was
not
freely
given.
he
says
it
was
not
freely
given
because
it
was
given
to
rebut
certain
confessions
that
had
been
introduced
and
were
later
held
to
have
been
improperly
introduced
against
him
at
that
second
trial.
he
states
that
a
little
bit
differently
when
he
talks
about
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
he
says
that
this
testimony
flowed
from
or
was
the
result
of
these
statements
that
later
were
held
to
have
been
improperly
admitted
and
that
therefore
his
testimony
was
the
fruit
of
that
illegality.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantial
difference.
i
think
it's
mainly
one
of
terminology.
you
do
have
some
different
cases
you
can
throw
in
and
different
analogies
you
can
draw,
but
i
think
in
substance,
the
claim
is
the
same.
but
we
start
at
a
somewhat
different
point
than
petitioner
does.
it
has
been
the
accepted
rule
that,
except
in
very
rare
instances
when
a
witness
takes
a
stand,
testifies
under
oath
that
what
he
says
is
accountable
for
and
it
can
be
used
against
him
in
any
appropriate
way
in
a
later
proceeding.
now,
he
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify
at
all
at
his
second
trial.
he
could
remain
silent
but
he
didn't
do
that.
under
ordinary
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
case
is
quite
clear
that
that
testimony
would
have
been
usable
and
admissible
for
any
relevant
purpose.
but
he
says
that
that's
not
so,
that
this
is
a
different
kind
of
case.
he
says
it's
a
different
kind
of
case
as
we
understand
it
because
statements
had
been
introduced
against
him,
which
were
later
held
had
been
improperly
introduced
and
that
that
triggered
his
taking
the
stand
and
therefore,
all
of
that
has
to
be
wiped
out.
the
government
can't
use
it.
the
matter
isn't
that
simple,
i
don't
think,
and
we
don't
maintain
that
it
is.
we
do
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
gave
extended
consideration
of
the
difficult
questions
involved
in
this
case
and
i
will
come
to
that
later
in
the
context
of
the
speedy
trial
claim.
i
think
that
their
analysis
is
as
pertinent
as
anything
that
i
could
say.
they
said
our
federal
system
bestows
upon
--
this
is
at
the
appendix,
page
75
--
our
federal
system
bestows
upon
accused
the
choice
of
testifying
or
not,
and
permits
what
he
says
in
the
witness
stand
to
be
used
against
him
coercively.
the
record
contains
no
suggestion
that
the
use
of
the
statements
of
the
second
trial
was
a
maneuver
to
ring
evidence
from
appellant.
from
what
it
appears,
the
government's
sole
objective
was
to
supply
missing
elements
in
its
case.
here
on
like
situations
were
duress
of
some
sort
has
been
found,
the
government
exerted
no
pressure
or
put
no
undisciplined
and
imposed
no
improper
condition
on
appellant's
right
to
mootness.
there
was
uninhibited
access
to
counsel
and
so
far
as
we
can
perceive,
complete
awareness
of
legal
rights.
we
have
been
referred
in
no
case
and
our
own
intensive
research
is
located
not
holding
that
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
is
itself
officiating
a
form
of
testimonial
compulsion.
now,
petitioner
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
yes?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
get
a
conviction.
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
very
slim.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
who
admits
that,
your
honor.
we
don't.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
his
argument.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
introduction
of
the
statements
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
his
taking
the
stand.
whether
they
produced
his
taking
the
stand
in
a
direct
causal
sense
i
think
is
another
and
a
difficult
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
at
all
to
show
that.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
that
was
not
so.
the
--
i
might
say
this
about
these
confessions.
i
think
this
is
quite
pertinent.
petitioner,
and
i
think
properly,
refers
to
them
as
having
been
illegally
obtained.
but
i
think
we
better
take
a
look
at
how
they
were
held
to
have
been
illegally
obtained.
petitioner
made
essentially
three
statements
that
were
introduced.
the
first
statement
was
taken
from
him
at
the
jail
where
he's
being
held
on
another
charge,
larceny
or
some
sort
of
charge.
it
was
taken
in
this
context.
white
and
samson,
the
other
alleged
co-defendants
have
made
statements
to
the
police
admitting
their
activity
in
regard
of
the
murder
of
syder
brown
and
implicating
petitioner.
those
statements
of
course
were
ultimately
held
to
have
been
improperly
obtained
in
violation
of
mallory
because
they
had
not
properly
been
brought
to
a
magistrate.
the
next
morning
after
the
statements
have
been
given,
white
and
samson
were
brought
down
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
there
was
another
statement
of
petitioner
that
came
after
this
oral
statement
that
was
also
thrown
out
on
mallory
but
that
was
a
substantial
restatement
of
what
he'd
said
at
the
jail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
that's
the
point
i'm
coming
to
this.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
his
oral
statement
given
at
the
jail
was
given
--
he
was
apprised
of
what
white
and
samson
had
said,
and
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say.
and
he
said,
“yes,”
--
it's
something
like
this.
i
don't
remember
the
exact
statement,
“i
might
as
well
tell
you,”
and
then
he
told
his
story.
now,
subsequently
that
story
was
reduced
to
a
written
statement
and
the
story
was
also
given
to
a
jail
classification
officer.
those
other
two
written
statements
were
held
inadmissible
under
mallory
and
killough.
but
this
first
statement
was
the
one
that
precipitated
the
en
banc
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
second
trial.
that
statement
was
held
inadmissible
eventually
by
a
six
to
four
vote
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
its
introduction
would
violate
the
rule
of
case
of
harling
versus
united
states.
that
case
essentially
had
held
that
where
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
had
not
yet
been
waived,
a
mistake
that
made
by
an
individual
being
held
on
a
charge
to
which
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
would
originally
attach
could
not
be
used
against
him.
now,
on
these
circumstances,
the
petitioner
had
been
10
days
short
of
18
years
old
when
the
alleged
felony
murder
occurred.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
as
i
understand
it,
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
probably
so.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right,
and
i
think
that
cuts
both
ways.
i
think
you're
quite
right.
but
for
whatever
it
is
worth,
these
illegally
obtained
statements
were
not
held
inadmissible
on
the
ground
that
they've
been
beaten
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
like
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'd
like
to
discuss
simmons
right
now.
we
think
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
significantly
different
than
the
one
in
the
simmons
case.
i
think
it
is
better
to
say
that
had
simmons
been
decided
differently,
the
question
here
would
be
easier
for
the
government,
but
it
was
not.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
very
pertinent
distinctions
between
the
situation
in
simmons,
as
you
may
recall.
simmons
involved
a
testimony
given
at
a
motion
to
suppress
a
hearing.
the
motion
to
suppress
was
unsuccessful
and
that
testimony
was
introduced
against
the
--
against
garret
actually
at
the
trial
and
was
quite
a
pertinent
evidence
of
his
connection
with
the
suitcase
and
its
contents.
now
there,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
there
were
two
constitutional
rights
involved,
one
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
right
to
be
free
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
one
under
the
fifth,
not
to
be
compelled
to
testify
against
one's
self.
here
as
we
see
it,
there's
one
right
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
pointed
out
in
simmons
that
defendants
might
be
deterred
from
taking
the
stand
at
a
motion
to
suppress
hearing
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
harling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
was
--
they
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
they
can
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
construed
harling
to
this
effect
that
even
if
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
had
not
yet
initially
attached
to
an
individual
being
held
and
they
had
not
had
the
opportunity
to
waive
it,
the
fact
that
he
was
under
18
at
the
time
he
committed
the
alleged
offense
was
sufficient
to
make
that
doctrine
applicable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it's
a
doctrine
that's
derived
from
the
construction
of
the
juvenile
court
statutes
in
the
district
of
columbia,
as
i
understand
it.
now,
getting
back
to
simmons
as
i
said,
the
court
there
pointed
out,
and
we
think
quite
significantly,
that
defendants
might
be
deterred
from
taking
the
stand
to
support
a
motion
to
suppress
if
they
knew
that
the
motion
to
suppress
was
unsuccessful.
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him.
the
court
pointed
out
that
while
the
jones
case
had
taken
care
of
a
large
number
of
these
kinds
of
situations
that
it
still
remained
that
there
were
marginal
cases
in
which
this
choice
would
be
a
difficult
one
to
make.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
here,
there's
no
question
of
a
surrender
of
one
constitutional
right
in
order
to
assert
another.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
simmons.
it
was
something
it
found
intolerable.
it
said
that
the
practical
effect
in
the
simmons
situation
was
to
require
an
individual
if
the
only
way
he
could
show
standing
and
therefore
an
ability
to
raise
his
fourth
amendment
claim
was
to
take
the
stand.
but
he
either
had
to
take
the
stand
and
run
the
risk
of
waiving
his
right
not
to
incriminate
if
he
wanted
to
assert
his
fourth
amendment
right.
we
think
there's
another
important
distinction
and
perhaps
the
most
important
one
between
the
simmons
situation
and
this
one.
in
our
view,
the
compulsion
which
petitioner
might
have
felt
to
testify
here
was
simply
not
dictated
by
any
requirement
that
made
his
testifying
the
only
way
it
would
raise
a
legal
issue.
in
simmons,
that
was
so.
if
--
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
if
he
accepted
the
premise
on
which
the
court
offered
in
simmons,
there
simply
wasn't
any
way
that
the
individual
could
make
this
claim.
he
had
a
show
of
standing
under
our
laws
as
it
presently
stands
and
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
by
definition
he
couldn't
show
that
and
therefore,
his
fourth
amendment
right
went
out
of
the
window.
this
isn't
so
here.
it's
quite
clear
that
in
order
to
protect
his
rights,
he
had
a
clear
and
available
way
to
raise
them
and
that
was
simply
by
objecting
as
he
did
to
the
introduction
of
these
statements
and
if
he
was
vindicated
upon
appeal
as
he
indeed
was.
now,
he
said
--
petitioner
says,
“well,
that's
all
well
and
good
but
that's
simply
no
real
alternative
to
me.”
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
we
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
more
difficult
to
make
because
the
next
is
in
the
continuity
of
alleged
violations
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
very
--
i'd
like
to
also
--
in
conclusion
on
simmons,
it
just
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
not
simmons
and
it's
not
controlled
by
simmons.
i'd
like
to
mention
griffin
versus
california
in
passing
because
that
case
was
relied
upon
by
judges
bazelon
and
wright
in
descending
from
a
rehearing
en
banc,
petition
denial
in
this
last
appeal.
it
seems
to
us
that
griffin
is
a
different
situation.
griffin,
as
i'm
sure
you
recall,
involved
a
question
of
whether
it
was
unconstitutional
to
make
adverse
comment
on
the
failure
to
take
a
stand.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there,
the
court
said
that
a
price
was
placed
upon
remaining
silent.
the
invocation
of
privilege
was
made
plausibly.
the
only
way
of
course
to
remedy
an
adverse
comment,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
is
simply
to
take
the
stand
because
that's
the
only
way
you
could
avoid
again
those
states
in
which
the
rule
applied
prior
to
griffin.
well,
here
it's
quite
plain
that
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
testified
at
the
second
trial
and
--
so
there's
no
question
about
adverse
comment
of
that
trial
on
his
failure
to
testify.
the
question
is
simply
whether
his
election
to
testify
was
voluntary
or
not.
the
advice
that
was
found
in
griffin
it
seems
to
us
was
that
there
simply
wasn't
any
way
to
avoid
this.
the
petitioner
had
a
way
to
avoid
it.
in
fact,
he
exercised
it
by
testifying.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
that
would
happen.
that
--
that's
one
of
the
claims
that
is
made
here,
your
honor.
under
the
federal
court,
it
says
that
the
scope
of
cross
is
limited
to
direct.
he
says
--
he
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
that
relates
to
--
but
the
reason
i
understand
it
where
prior
convictions
could
be
introduced
is
to
impeach
his
credibility
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
situation
you
posed
is
a
closer
one
to
the
simmons
situation.
i
think
the
argument
would
be
more
difficult.
the
same
argument
that
we
make
here
could
be
made,
of
course.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
why
isn't
it
this
situation?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
charge
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
you
have
to
differentiate
the
reasons
why
he
says
he
took
a
stand.
in
that
situation
that
you
posed,
you
said
that
he
had
to
take
the
stand
because
that
was
the
only
way
that
he
could
show
that
those
confessions
were
involuntary.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
here,
we
don't
have
a
serious
question
about
voluntariness.
it
is
asserted
by
petitioner
and
he
said
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
he
had
to
take
the
stand.
but
it
seems
to
me
on
that
point,
my
original
answer
is
it
remains
pertinent
that
while
his
prior
convictions
could
be
brought
out
to
impeach
him,
that's
so
as
to
anyone
who
takes
the
stand.
but
the
scope
of
cross-examination
would
have
been
limited,
if
that
was
his
problem,
to
matters
that
he
raised
non-direct.
and
if
he
testified
only
about
threats
and
abuse
and
whatever
and
didn't
affirmatively
testify
about
a
rather
different
subject
matter,
what
went
on
in
his
view
at
the
critical
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
could
not
be
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
thought
i
said
that
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
it
was
the
only
way,
the
question
of
voluntariness,
you
had
it
seems
to
me
a
different
situation
than
you
have
here
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
basic
claim
here
is
not
one
of
involuntariness
with
respect
to
the
statements
that
were
later
held.
it
have
been
legally
obtained
that
the
claim
was
a
--
as
i've
discussed
the
mallory
claim
and
this
harling
rationale.
one
thing
that
is
significant
to
us
is
that
petitioner
really
doesn't
attempt
to
deal
with
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
that
he
sticks
to
have
the
court
adopt
here
in
the
fifth
amendment
context.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
a
criminal
defendant's
decision,
whether
to
take
the
stand
or
not,
is
always
one
that's
under
some
strain
and
some
stress
and
that
only
one
of
the
risks
that
is
taken
is
that
the
testimony
might
be
used
against
him
at
retrial.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
petitioner
is
correct
in
his
basic
contention,
that
is
that
a
second
trial
testimony
was
compelled
involuntary,
then
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
as
a
logical
matter
why
that
sort
of
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
any
respect,
not
just
on
the
question
of
guilt
in
a
subsequent
trial.
now,
i
suppose
petitioner
would
say,
“well,
that's
not
right.
all
that
i'm
contending
for
here
is
that
it
can't
be
used
affirmatively
against
me
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
the
government
tries
to
use
it
to
impeach
if
i
do
take
the
stand.
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
i'm
later
prosecuted
for
perjury
and
the
government
tries
to
use
this
testimony.
and
it's
a
different
situation
if
the
government
uses
it
as
a
link
or
a
lead
or
whatever.”
well,
maybe
so,
but
you
have
to
work
a
little
bit
at
it,
it
seems
to
me,
to
destroy
the
consistency
that
seems
to
us
to
be
there.
i
would
like
in
the
remaining
moments
to
mention
just
one
more
thing,
first
on
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
it
seems
to
us
the
petitioner
really
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
he
wants
to
be
able
to
take
the
stand
and
he
wants
to
try
to
convince
the
jury
that
they
should
acquit
him.
in
which
case,
he
couldn't
be
retried
at
all,
of
course.
but
if
he
fails
on
that
but
prevails
on
his
objections
to
the
introduction
of
these
statements,
he
wants
it
to
be
assumed
that
he
never
took
the
stand
and
he
never
said
anything.
he
wants
the
slate
totally
wiped
clean.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
situation
were
analogous
to
simmons,
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
assert
a
right
to
have
these
inadmissible
statements
excluded
at
trial
and
if
he
couldn't
preserve
that
right
for
appellate
review
without
taking
the
stand,
then
i
think
he
should
prevail
under
simmons.
i
think
simmons
would
require
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
if
the
individual
was
in
the
courtroom,
would
it
be
necessary
to
call
him
rather
than
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
he
should
call
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
do
whatever
he
wanted
to
do,
to
take
the
stand
and
that
the
government
could
not
call
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
the
accepted
rule
but
some
people
have
questioned
that
rule.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
there
said
the
analogy
that
they
saw
was
that
of
any
extrajudicial
confession
or
statement,
that
if
it
was
voluntarily
made,
you
can
say
the
same
thing.
you
can
say
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
how
can
use
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
his
testimony?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
his
testimony
was
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
it
admitted
--
it
admitted
very
damaging
elements.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
but
we
don't
stick
to
really
on
that
because
this
court
has
said
that
when
--
that's
a
terminology.
if
they
want
to
use
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
said
that
--
he
said
that
he
was
--
he
placed
himself
at
the
scene
and
he
said
he
had
a
loaded
gun.
you
know,
i
think
that's
pretty
damaging.
the
jury
obviously
thought
it
was,
too,
coupled
with
the
other
evidence
and
circumstances.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
was
trying
to
pawn
it,
he
said.
he'd
done
that
frequently
before
with
this
individual.
we
--
we
don't
accept
petitioner's
statement
that
--
and
i
should
mention
this
that
there
was
simply
no
other
evidence.
there
was
other
evidence
here.
he
made
an
admission
against
interest
that
said
that
he'd
done
it
to
somebody
else.
there
was
other
circumstantial
evidence
against
him,
the
trajectory
of
the
shot,
the
fact
that
the
man
had
a
lot
of
money,
they
were
seen
in
a
black
buick
just
previous
the
--
it
just
seems
to
us
that
the
question
presented
is
the
fifth
amendment
issue
and
i
haven't
sought
to
go
into
all
those
details.
i
just
like
to
touch
on
this
sixth
amendment
argument.
petitioner
spent
a
good
bit
of
time
on
it.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
i
don't
have
a
little
more
time,
but
i
just
like
to
say
this.
first,
we
understand
that
he
says
two
things
basically.
one,
this
is
just
too
long
and
you
can't
try
me
anymore.
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
the
circumstances.
the
court
--
this
court
has
never
held
that
through
the
exercise
of
legal
rights
through
appellate
review
and
obtaining
reversals
and
other
relief
that
the
individual
can't
be
tried
again.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
what
petitioner
really
tries
to
do
is
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
second-guess
the
reasons
why
they
had
problems
with
the
case.
i
think
that
as
we
point
out
if
one
thinks
about
and
looks
at
the
problems,
it's
a
very
complicated
matter
and
the
time
was
substantial.
we
don't
deny
that
and
i
don't
know
why
it
took
them
so
long,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
not
intolerable.
in
short,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
write
on
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
points
and
the
judgment
should
be
confirmed.
