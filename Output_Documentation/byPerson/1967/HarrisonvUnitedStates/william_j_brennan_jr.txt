but
they
didn't
take
the
stand
at
the
third
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prather,
may
i
ask,
what
reference
is
the
government
making
in
its
plea
to
page
29
when
it
says
that
delays
for
the
most
part
arrived
at
the
consequence
of
his
own
or
his
attorney's
actions
which
he
is
responsible.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think,
mr.
beytagh
that's
--
would
that
be
phrased
differently
if
it
were
said
that
the
government's
use
of
illegally
obtained
admissions
coerced
and
in
that
sense
compelled
him
to
take
a
stand?
is
that
phrased
any
differently
than
the
fruits
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
beytagh,
that's
only
white
and
samson's
statements
were
thrown
out
of
mallory
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
all
of
these
then
went
out
initially
on
mallory
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
at
the
second
trial,
was
that
a
ground
of
objection
to
the
use
of
the
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
to
say
then
i've
got
--
defense
had
real
confidence
as
events
turned
out.
in
that
ground,
they
might
have
rested
on
their
objection
without
putting
the
defendant
on
the
stand
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
took
an
en
banc
hearing.
six
to
four
finally
had
to
decide
that
the
objection
was
well-taken,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
coerced
in
any
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
not
on
any
ground
that
they
were
even
coerced,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
beytagh,
that's
what
i
want
to
get
to.
then
the
government's
position
is
that
these
confessions
were
not
found
inadmissible
on
any
fifth
amendment
ground,
that
is
a
coerced
confession
ground,
but
solely
on
mallory
or
in
the
case
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
harling
because
he
had
not
been,
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
should
have
happened?
he
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
some
days
under
18.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
and
that
doctrine
was
not
a
constitutional
doctrine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
be
arguing
differently
if
these
confessions
indeed
were
the
allegation
was
ultimately
sustained,
that
these
were
coerced
confessions
and
in
that
sense
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege?
would
you
give
that
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
you
might
just
to
rest
around
your
objection,
confident
that
you
would
succeed
as
you
finally
did,
and
then
this
thing
could
never
have
happened,
could
it?
had
you
just
rested
on
your
objection
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
his
choice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
fact
is
had
you
--
had
here
just
been
the
objection,
you
would
not
be
in
this
difficulty
since
the
court
of
appeals
did
sustain
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
didn't
take
the
stand
at
the

trial.
