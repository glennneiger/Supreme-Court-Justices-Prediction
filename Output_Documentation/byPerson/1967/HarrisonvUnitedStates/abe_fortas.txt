justice
abe
fortas
then
judge
robinson
recites
some
when
he
tried
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
the
petitioner
here
and
one
of
the
other
men
were
in
a
room
together
and
they
police
got
a
confession
from
the
other
man
which
was
used
against
the
petitioner.
and
the
petitioner
was
the
only
person
who
could
testify
that
the
police
got
that
by
force.
and
then,
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
to
that
and
on
cross-examination
there
is
fact
to
have
brought
up,
which
were
very
damaging
to
the
petitioner.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
no,
no.
suppose
the
prior
convictions
were
brought
out.
just
take
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
simple
example
which
can
be
done
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
a
federal
court
or
anywhere
else
that
i
know
of.
justice
abe
fortas
could
that
be
used
against
him
in
a
said
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
--
the
critical
point
that
i'm
putting
to
you
is
that
this
was
a
situation
in
which
the
confession
of
an
alleged
accomplice
was
being
used
against
the
man
in
order
to
show
that
that
--
to
attack
that
confession,
he
took
the
stand
and
i'm
assuming
--i'm
asking
here
to
assume
that
the
only
person
who
could
have
testified
that
the
confession
was
compelled
and
not
voluntary
was
the
petitioner.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
nevertheless
say
that
the
confession
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
trial?
i
mean
--
i
don't
mean
the
confession.
could
his
testimony
be
used
against
him
in
the
status
before
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
why
isn't
that
this
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
distinguishing
factor
in
your
mind
between
the
case
that
i've
put
to
you
and
the
present
case
with
respect
to
the
use
of
petitioner's
testimony
on
the
subsequent
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
whereas
in
the
present
case,
what
happened?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
wait
a
minute
let's
see
if
i
understand
you
then.
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
the
petitioner's
testimony
could
properly
have
been
used
in
the
subsequent
trial
despite
the
fact
that
evidence,
as
to
prior
convictions,
was
brought
out
on
cause
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment.
and
that
evidence
as
to
prior
convictions
is
also
used
in
the
subsequent
trial.
you're
saying
despite
that,
the
evidence
could
properly
be
used
in
the
subsequent
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
the
only
way
--
this
is
the
assumption
i'm
asking
you
to
make
--
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
of
the
accomplice
could
be
attacked.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
asking
you
is
how
different?
is
it
different
enough
to
make
a
difference
in
result
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
these
were
statements
made
by
somebody
else
in
prior
proceeding
and
that
person
was
in
the
courtroom,
could
the
prosecuting
attorney
have
gotten
up
and
read
the
q&a
to
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
my
question.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
call
him,
not
should,
isn't
it?
well,
now
what's
the
difference
here?
petitioner
was
in
the
courtroom,
he
was
a
prisoner
but
he
wasn't
given
an
opportunity
to
take
a
stand
or
not
taking
a
stand
but
his
testimony
was
read.
justice
abe
fortas
the
government
couldn't
call
him
but
in
the
case
of
a
person
other
than
the
defendant
if
the
government
wanted
his
testimony
in
and
he
were
available,
the
government
would
have
to
call
on
him.
they
couldn't
read
his
prior
trial
testimony.
justice
abe
fortas
or
an
admission?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
was
an
attempt
to
exculpate
himself.
it
wasn't
an
exculpatory
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
can't
rely
on
it
but
i
wonder
if
this
is
an
admission
or
if
this
can
be
called
an
admission
or
a
confession
on
the
prior
testimony.
justice
abe
fortas
then
judge
robinson
recites
some
when
he

the
