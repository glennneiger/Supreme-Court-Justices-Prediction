justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
prather,
where
is
that
vagueness
objection?
as
i
read
the
record,
he
said
“i
object”,
the
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
objection
was
reading
certain
words.
he
didn't
want
certain
things
read.
whereas
to
the
statement
itself,
i
thought
all
i
saw
was
“i
object.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
page
48,
mr.
thomas,
“i
object
to
the
reading
of
this
testimony.”
the
court,
“overruled.”
end
of
that
sentence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
after.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sorry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
oh!
i'll
find
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
could
be
rather
the
material
if
the
judge
had
known
exactly
what
the
objection
was.
he
might
have
kept
it
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
prather,
then
you
would've
had
to
declare
mistrial,
right,
because
he's
sworn
before
the
jury.
but
before
it
went
before
the
jury,
if
mr.
thomas
had
explained
his
constitutional
objections,
the
judge
would
have
at
least
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
constitutional
objections.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he'd
file
at
the
second
course,
he
would
have
been
here
saying
that
it
was
before
the
jury
and
he
had
to
have
this
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
--
how
many
witnesses
did
the
defendant
have
in
the
first
--
second
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
were
they
prejudiced
by
the
delay?
so
far,
his
witnesses
and
availability
of
witnesses
is
a
concern.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
were
the
petitioners
injured
in
so
far
as
availability
of
witnesses
concerned
by
the
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
did
the
delay
prejudice
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
that
affect
that
trial?
did
it
delay
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
that
prejudices
them?
if
all
the
prosecuting
witnesses
had
gone
they
wouldn't
be
prejudiced
at
all,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
different
point.
i'm
talking
about
the
speedy
trial
point
by
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
read
all
of
the
included
--
they
raised
a
question
and
the
prosecutor
was
raising
his
voice
and
all
of
those
things.
i
read
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
second
trial,
without
the
confessions
and
without
the
testimony
of
the
defendants,
they
couldn't
have
been
convicted
in
the
second
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
doesn't
that
give
you
a
problem
as
to
coercion?
it
was
admittedly
the
coerced
confessions
that
brought
about
them
taking
the
stand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
you
said
first
comes
close
to
saying
it.
my
first
one
whether
they
didn't
take
the
stand
at
all,
they
were
more
likely
to
have
been
acquitted.
and
so,
the
judgment
has
taken
the
stand
or
the
judgment
was
still
brought
about
by
it.
and
as
i
understand,
the
petitioner,
he
says
that's
coercion
or
close
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whether
or
not
--
there's
no
question
here
that
the
prosecutor
did
this
deliberately
to
get
him
on
the
stand.
there's
nothing
here
to
show
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
he'd
made
a
confession
that's
a
valid
confession,
can
you
put
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
a
confession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
the
story
that
he
was
trying
to
sell
a
loaded,
cocked,
sawed
off
shotgun
pointed
at
the
potential
buyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
his
testimony?
justice
thurgood
