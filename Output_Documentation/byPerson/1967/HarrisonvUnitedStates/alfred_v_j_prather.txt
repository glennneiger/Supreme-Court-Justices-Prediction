mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
felony
murder
case
brought
in
form
of
proffers
and
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioner,
eddie
mcarthur
harrison
is
in
the
d.c.
jail
serving
a
life
sentence
imposed
following
his
third
conviction
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
affirmance
of
that
conviction
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
a
denial
of
rehearing
on
en
banc
by
that
court,
six
members
of
that
court
over
the
dissent
of
chief
judge
bazelon
and
circuit
judge
wright.
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
raises
two
questions.
first,
whether
testimony
given
by
him
at
a
former
trial
to
rebut
confessions
erroneously
admitted
and
illegally
obtained
could
be
used
against
him
at
the
retrial
as
part
of
the
government's
direct
case
on
the
question
of
guilt.
and
second,
whether
he
has
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
the
record
giving
lies
to
these
questions
is
long
and
unusual
but
the
facts
are
fairly
simple
and
not
really
on
dispute.
the
petitioner
and
two
other
boys,
joseph
samson
and
orson
white,
were
indicted
on
april
1,
1960
for
the
felony
murder
of
one
syder
george
brown,
a
fence
and
gambler.
at
the
trial,
the
principal
evidence
against
them
was
a
set
of
confessions
which
admitted
that
syder
george
brown
had
been
killed
during
the
course
of
an
attempted
robbery.
at
the
trial,
the
boys
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
the
confessions
were
false
and
had
been
obtained
by
threats
and
abuse.
the
truth
was,
the
petitioner
explained,
that
syder
brown
had
been
killed
accidentally
during
an
innocent
attempt
to
pawn
a
shotgun
with
him.
now
the
jury
convicted,
the
boys,
were
sentenced
to
death
which
was
the
mandatory
sentence
for
felony
murder
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time.
thereafter
shortly,
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
counsel
who
had
participated
in
the
case
was
not
a
lawyer
at
all
but
an
imposter,
one
daniel
oliver
wendellholmes
morgan
who
had
substituted
himself
for
one
l.a.
harris,
a
real
lawyer
who
had
left
the
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
immediately
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
receive
and
grant
motions
for
a
new
trial.
but
the
boys
sitting
down
in
the
district
jail
on
death
row
refused
to
file
such
motions
and
repudiated
them
when
they
were
filed
on
their
behalf
by
the
court
appointed
counsel
because
the
boys
did
not
want
to
waive
their
right
to
be
tried
but
once
for
the
same
crime.
there
the
matter
sat
for
a
number
of
months
until
the
court
of
appeals
eventually
ordered
a
new
trial
for
the
boys
despite
their
refusal
to
ask
for
it.
at
the
second
trial,
again,
the
confessions
were
introduced.
again,
the
boys
took
the
stand.
again,
they
were
convicted,
only
this
time
they
were
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
the
mandatory
death
sentence
in
the
district
of
columbia
having
meanwhile
been
abolished.
there
followed
an
appeal
and
the
case
was
argued
challenging
--
basically
challenging
the
admission
of
the
confessions
that
have
been
used
against
him
in
some
other
points.
it
was
argued
in
december
of
1963.
there
the
matter
sat
for
some
18
months
until
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
motion
ordered
rehearing
en
banc
sua
sponte
on
the
question
of
the
admission
of
one
of
the
petitioner's
confessions.
case
was
reargued
and
some
six
months
later
or
two
years
after
the
original
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
a
decision
holding
all
of
the
confessions
inadmissible
because
they
had
been
illegally
obtained.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
there
was
no
reason
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
he
said
that
the
--
he
said
that
the
lengthy
opinions
and
the
amount
of
deliberation
that
went
into
them
spoke
for
themselves.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
spoke
for
themselves.
he
said
that
the
court
was
accustomed
to
take
in
great
pains
with
difficult
cases
like
this.
now,
there
followed
the
third
trial
which
was
very
brief.
at
the
third
trial
with
the
confessions
gone,
there
was
no
real
evidence
of
felony
murder,
but
the
prosecutor
supplied
that
lack
by
reading
the
testimony
given
by
the
boys
to
rebut
the
illegally
obtained
and
inadmissible
confessions
at
the
second
trial.
he
also
had
three
live
witnesses
and
he
read
some
other
testimony
from
the
second
trial,
but
this
other
testimony
didn't
really
make
out
a
case
of
felony
murder
and
if
that
had
been
all
there
was
to
it,
the
case
might
have
been
dismissed.
certainly,
it
should
have
been.
it
was
as
to
one
of
the
defendants,
samson.
but
orson
white
and
eddie
harrison
were
reconvicted
on
the
basis
of
their
testimony
given
at
the
second
trial
to
rebut
the
illegally
obtained
and
inadmissible
confessions.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
they
did
not
take
the
stand
and
objected
vigorously
to
the
use
of
their
testimony
from
the
former
trial.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
actually,
there
were
more
than
one
objection
and
there
was
some
discussion
to
this
actually
in
the
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
that
was
at
the
outside
--
at
the
outset
of
the
testimony,
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
were
two
objections,
one
objection
when
the
government
started
to
read
white's
testimony
then
again
when
they
started
to
read
harrison's
testimony,
then
again
during
the
reading
of
harrison's
testimony
and
then
again
at
the
end.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
65
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes.
judge
kern
wasn't
listening
to
argument
on
that
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
judge
kern
wasn't
listening
to
argument
on
that
objection.
we
had
raised
that
before
at
the
outset
when
mr.
white
--
when
his
testimony
was
being
read,
too.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
now,
that
is
not
in
this
joint
appendix.
it
is
in
the
transcript
however.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
if
i
don't
stand
on
the
word
“vigor”,
your
honor,
in
the
objection,
there
was
objection
to
the
reading
of
the
testimony
and
the
court
understood.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
your
honor,
he
certainly
knew
what
it
was
before
that
was
--
after
it
had
been
read,
there's
no
question
about
that
if
you
turn
to
page
65.
he
said
specifically
the
fifth
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
has
been
given
judicially
before
it's
available
to
the
government.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
when
he
did
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
precise
constitutional
question,
he
promptly
overruled
it
and
he
could
have
at
that
time
ruled
the
testimony
out
if
he
had
been
overviewed
to
entertain
an
objection
on
that
ground,
but
he
wasn't
at
all.
he
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
no.
then,
he
would
have
dismissed
the
case
as
he
did
against
samson
because
then,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
case
because
the
case
was
the
testimony
of
the
boys
and
precious
little
else.
now,
the
government
defends
the
use
of
this
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
voluntarily
given,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
can
really
contend
that
consider
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
given.
the
confessions
--
here
were
these
confessions
that
admitted
guilt
clearly.
the
boys
had
objected
that
they
were
false
and
should
not
be
and
had
been
obtained
by
threats
and
abuse.
the
judge
had
ruled
that
they
were
to
go
to
the
jury.
the
boys
had
already
been
convicted
once
and
spent
22
months
on
death
row
on
account
of
those
confessions.
they
knew
they
were
going
to
be
convicted.
if
they
got
on
the
stand,
they
might
not
have
a
very
good
chance
but
if
they
didn't
get
on
the
stand,
they
had
no
chance
at
all.
they
were
faced
with
certain
conviction
and
possible
death
and
they
knew
it.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
petitioner
was
18.
by
the
time
of
this
trial,
he
was
about
21.
now,
there
was
only
one
chance
and
that
was
to
go
before
that
jury
and
try
to
persuade
them
that
the
confessions
were
false
and
to
give
them
the
boys'
own
story,
incriminating
as
that
was.
and
so,
he
took
the
stand
but
i
don't
see
how
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
could
be
considered
voluntary.
he
testified
but
only
under
great
and
improper
pressure,
improper
because
it
stemmed
from
illegally
obtained
evidence
erroneously
admitted.
and
i
think
to
use
testimony
obtained
in
those
circumstances
is
fundamentally
wrong.
when
eddie
harrison
was
awarded
a
new
trial
almost
five
and
a
half
years
after
he
had
first
been
imprisoned
for
this
offense,
the
least
he
was
entitled
to
was
a
fair
trial
and
he
didn't
get
it.
what
he
got
instead
was
a
trial
at
which
he
was
made
the
government
star
witness
against
his
will
with
words
extracted
from
him
by
the
use
of
illegally
obtained
evidence.
i
don't
see
how
a
conviction
so
obtained
can
be
squared
with
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
under
the
decision
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
so
i
think
the
conviction
must
be
reversed,
but
that
is
not
enough.
the
indictment
against
him
should
also
be
dismissed
because
of
the
long
delay
in
this
case.
it
is
now
more
than
eight
years
since
the
original
indictment
in
this
case
and
eddie
harrison
has
been
in
jail
all
that
time.
eight
years
is
a
long
time
to
anyone.
it's
particularly
long
to
someone
as
young
as
eddie
harrison
that's
almost
a
third
of
his
life.
it
is
all
of
his
adult
life.
an
examination
of
the
record
shows
that
this
great
delay
was
occasioned
largely
by
the
failure
of
the
judicial
machinery
to
function
well
and
expeditiously,
and
the
failure
was
greatest
in
the
court
of
appeals.
five
of
those
eight
years
nearly
have
been
spent
on
appeals,
four
of
them
on
court
deliberations
alone,
and
two
years
on
that
one
occasion
between
the
original
argument
and
final
decision
and
at
that
starting
some
three
and
a
half
years
after
the
case,
it
already
begun
and
when
speedy
trial
had
been
argued
to
them
already.
now,
i
understand
and
i
would
not
dispute
that
the
right
of
a
speedy
trial
is
necessarily
relative
that
it
must
depend
someone
on
the
circumstances
that
it's
consistent
with
due
deliberation
and
an
undue
haste
is
not
required.
but
when
all
that
has
been
said,
sometime,
somewhere,
somehow
the
right
and
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
has
to
be
given
meaning
and
effect.
the
word
speedy
can
only
be
stretched
so
far
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
stretched
it
way
beyond
the
breaking
point
when
it
justified
the
long
delays
in
this
case.
at
least
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
must
guard
against
delays
that
are
unreasonable
or
unnecessary,
and
the
delays
in
this
case
were
both.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
any
way
for
this
to
have
been
raised
by
habeas
corpus.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
it
was
pending
at
all
times
that
the
court
of
appeals
were
sitting
down
there
to
decide
it.
i
suppose
habeas
corpus
might
lie
and
it
would
be
a
little
difficult
when
they
might
be
coming
out
with
a
decision
any
day.
the
case
has
been
argued,
submitted.
all
it
needs
is
the
judge
to
make
up
his
mind.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
i
think
he
does
have,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes.
i
don't
know
of
a
stage
of
this
particular
proceeding
where
it
would
have
been
appropriate,
but
certainly
habeas
corpus
is
an
appropriate
way
to
raise
a
question.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
hesitate
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
district
court
cases
and
any
number
of
cases
raising
precisely
that
question
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
on
much
shorter
periods
of
time
than
we're
talking
about
here
and
there
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
now,
the
government
on
brief
contends
that
there
is
another
standard
here
that
it
is
an
essential
element
of
a
claim
to
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
that
the
petitioner
show
that
his
actual
trial,
his
defense
was
prejudice
in
some
way.
that
it
seems
to
me
almost
changes
the
word
“speedy”
to
“fair”.
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is
that
as
long
as
he
ultimately
got
a
fair
trial,
never
mind
the
delay.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
cases
that
the
government
has
cited
stand
for
that
proposition
and
i
don't
think
that
the
word
“speedy”
can
be
stretched
or
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
stretched
to
mean
that,
but
even
if
it
could,
i
think
that
there
was
definite
prejudice
to
the
defense
in
this
case.
because
of
the
long
delay,
many
of
the
witnesses
were
no
longer
available.
somewhere
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
the
government
witnesses.
as
a
result,
the
defendants
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
these
witnesses.
now,
the
government
said
that
doesn't
matter
because
they
had
the
opportunity
at
the
second
trial,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
thing
at
all.
and
when
the
u.s.
attorney
stood
up
there
reading
in
a
very
authoritative
fashion
all
this
old
testimony
about
this
old
crime
and
when
the
jury
found
out
from
that
reading
that
these
defendants
had
already
been
tried
at
least
twice
and
had
spent
several
years
in
jail
on
account
of
this
very
killing,
they
were
almost
found
the
same,
that
the
defendants
were
guilty.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
your
honor,
there
were
two
things
that
were
held
to
be
their
own
fault.
first,
the
government
contended
and
the
court
below
held
that
when
these
boys
--
that
the
whole
delay
that
was
occasioned
by
their
refusal
to
seek
the
second
trial
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
willing
to
give
them
was
their
own
fault
because
they
should
have
asked
for
that.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
waive
their
double
jeopardy
claim
in
order
to
get
the
speedy
trial
that
everybody
knew
they
had
coming.
now,
the
government
here
says
in
answer
to
that
that
they
could
have
had
both,
that
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
for
a
new
trial
and
maintain
their
double
jeopardy
claim,
but
the
government
argued
exactly
the
opposite
when
they
were
down
there
on
death
row
faced
with
that
choice.
at
that
time,
the
government
was
saying
that
you
shouldn't
give
them
a
new
trial
unless
they
ask
for
it
because
they'll
have
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
so
that's
one
of
the
delays
that
these
folks
fall.
other
delays
that
are
attributed
to
these
people
and
were
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
erroneously
involves
the
time
after
the
court
of
appeals
finally
made
up
its
mind
to
go
ahead
and
give
them
another
trial
anyway
even
though
they
wouldn't
ask
for
it
and
the
time
when
that
trial
was
actually
held.
now,
that
period
of
time
on
page
8
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
we
have
all
the
dates
pretty
well
laid
out,
that
period
of
time
was
between
june
12,
1962
when
the
first
conviction
was
vacated
and
the
case
was
remanded
until
the
trial,
which
took
place
in
april
22.
now,
that
period
of
time,
there
was
one
month
that
we're
willing
to
say
might
be
attributable
to
the
petitioner
has
counsel.
he
asked
for
a
30-day
delay
in
order
to
obtain
a
transcript
to
the
first
trial.
now,
whether
the
need
to
get
a
transcript
in
the
form
of
proffers
case
is
properly
attributable
or
accounted
against
the
prisoner,
i
don't
know.
but
we
have
--
but
that's
all
of
the
time
that
was
really
attributable
to
him.
and
actually
in
our
discussion
of
this
point
and
particularly
the
reply
brief,
we
have
dealt
rather
fully
with
that
period
of
time.
it
begins
on
page
7
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
in
the
second
trial?
at
the
second
trial,
each
of
the
defendants
testified
--
one
other
witness
testified
that
i
know
of
in
connection
with
the
petitioner,
harrison,
and
i
believe
that
petitioner
samson
may
also
have
has
some
testimony
by
his
relatives
considering
--
concerning
his
appearance.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
they
were
not.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
first
they
were
kept
in
jail
for
eight
years
without
yet
having
a
fair
trial.
the
sheer
incarceration
for
eight
years
is
a
bit
of
time
and
they
were
under
considerable
duress.
then
beyond
that,
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
no,
it
only
affected
the
prisoners.
now,
it
related
to
the
trial
in
this
way.
when
the
thing
actually
got
around
to
being
tried
the
last
time,
the
prosecuting
witnesses
were
even
gone.
and
when
the
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
bit
of
difference.
he
just
read
their
testimony
right
out
of
the
transcript
of
the
last
trial
and
that
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
oh,
well,
i
think
that
the
effect
--
well,
any
prejudice
that
stemmed
from
the
delay
is
part
of
the
speedy
trial
in
question,
and
this
prejudice
stemmed
from
the
delay.
but
for
the
delay,
the
witnesses
would
have
been
there.
we
would
have
people
cross-examined,
not
some
u.s.
attorney
standing
up
there
reading
in
a
very
--
it
carried
the
force
and
the
weight
of
the
u.s.
attorney
when
he
read
it.
he
read
it
very
well.
and
not
only
that,
but
the
mere
fact
of
the
reading
and
from
the
actual
words
read,
it
became
known
to
the
jury
that
these
boys
had
been
in
jail
for
several
years.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
he
did.
this
is
a
kind
of
prejudice
that
came
from
the
delay.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
look
at
page
48,
your
honor,
here
that
mr.
epstein
starts
reading.
question:
“will
you
state
your
name?”
answer:
“eddie
mcarthur
harrison.”
question:
“you
have
been
at
the
dc
jail
for
several
years,
is
the
correct?”
answer:
“yes,
sir.”
then
he
interrupts
the
reading
and
he
says,
“this
testimony
was
given
on
may
3,
1963.”
the
jury
didn't
miss
the
point
that
as
early
as
may
3,
1963,
he
was
given
testimony
in
this
case
and
he
had
already
been
in
jail
for
several
years.
i
think
there
was
a
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defense,
but
i
don't
think
that's
an
essential
element
of
a
crime
of
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
he
was
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
without
regard
--
i
can
imagine
a
case
in
which
there
would
be
no
defense,
there
would
be
no
harm
to
the
defense
if
it
was
surely
a
documentary
case.
obviously
it
could
go
on
forever,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
person
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
and
it
certainly
wouldn't
change
the
sixth
amendment
command.
so
in
sum
then,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
just
want
to
urge
that
the
conviction
be
reversed
and
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed
because
the
petitioner
has
been
illegally
convicted
and
wrongfully
held
for
far
too
long.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
is
an
even
stronger
case
than
the
simmons
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
testimony
given
in
support
of
an
unsuccessful
motion
to
suppress
could
not
be
used
against
the
defendant.
now,
here
the
testimony
was
given
to
rebut
admittedly
inadmissible
evidence
illegally
obtained,
whereas
there
it
was
just
given
in
an
effort
to
show
that
it
was
inadmissible
evidence,
and
an
unsuccessful
effort
at
that.
now,
it
seems
to
me
far
wrong
for
the
government
5617
and
far
worse
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
in
the
simmons
case
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
it
was
the
tension
--
i'm
not
going
to
debate
with
you,
your
honor.
i
thought
--
opinion
says.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
i
have,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
it's
certainly
a
distinction,
but
here
there's
a
little
tension
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
principal
contention
of
the
petitioners
at
the
second
trial
was
that
these
confessions
were
obtained
in
violation
of
their
fifth
amendment
rights.
they
testified
that
they
were
obtained
by
threats
and
by
abuse,
and
that
the
only
point
in
which
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
between
eddie
harrison
and
the
police
office
who
investigated
--
the
police
officer
who
testified
to
the
contrary
and
obtained
the
confession,
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
turned
out
to
be
wrong
and
eddie
harrison
turned
out
to
be
telling
the
truth.
now,
there's
no
use
arguing
that
those
aren't
voluntary
confessions
anymore
because
the
jury
resolved
that
question
against
him.
but
the
point
is
that
they
were
getting
on
the
stand
to
say
that
to
claim
a
fifth
amendment
right,
to
say
that
these
were
compelled
confessions
and
they
were
false.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
argument
--
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
government
was
saying,
“well
look,
these
fellows
were
lucky
to
win
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
juvenile
court
blanc
because
that
really
wasn't
much
of
a
point.”
but
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
escobedo
there,
too.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
that
boy
wouldn't
sit
still
to
rest
on
the
objection
to
those
confessions
sitting
there.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
he
wasn't
advised
by
counsel,
but
that
boy
was
under
strong
compulsion
to
testify.
he
was
fresh
off
death
row,
22
months
there.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
that's
right
if
those
confessions
didn't
--
are
held
not
to
have
caused
him
in
any
way
to
take
the
stand,
or
if
his
testimony
can
be
said
to
be
completely
independent
of
it
and
not
the
fruit
of
the
introduction
of
those
confessions,
then
of
course
we
have
no
case.
but
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
separated,
and
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
pope
case
which
was
identically
this
case.
and
they
said
that
the
testimony
was
compelled
by
the
confessions
that
couldn't
be
used
and
it
could
never
be
used.
i
don't
see
--
we
can
look
some
more
at
the
circumstances
or
the
taking
of
those
confessions.
it
wasn't
just
--
this
was
not
some
little
minor
technical
point.
this
wasn't
the
most
innocent
of
errors.
those
police
knew
they
were
violating
mallory,
at
least
the
u.s.
attorney
did
when
it
got
time
to
arguing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
confessed
error.
it
shouldn't
have.
they
shouldn't
have
held
samson
for
two
years.
the
u.s.
attorney
confessed
error
in
his
case,
but
it
sat
up
there
for
two
years,
too.
and
orson
white
was
so
clear
that
the
--
that
there
was
no
problem
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
problem
was
this
one
little
confession
and
that
was
clearly
obtained
in
violation
of
escobedo.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
felony
murder
case
brought
in
form
of
proffers
and
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioner,
eddie
mcarthur
harrison
is
in
the
d.c.
jail
serving
a
life
sentence
imposed
following
his
third
conviction
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
affirmance
of
that
conviction
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
a
denial
of
rehearing
on
en
banc
by
that
court,
six
members
of
that
court
over
the
dissent
of
chief
judge
bazelon
and
circuit
judge
wright.
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
raises
two
questions.
first,
whether
testimony
given
by
him
at
a
former
trial
to
rebut
confessions
erroneously
admitted
and
illegally
obtained
could
be
used
against
him
at
the
retrial
as
part
of
the
government's
direct
case
on
the
question
of
guilt.
and
second,
whether
he
has
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
the
record
giving
lies
to
these
questions
is
long
and
unusual
but
the
facts
are
fairly
simple
and
not
really
on
dispute.
the
petitioner
and
two
other
boys,
joseph
samson
and
orson
white,
were
indicted
on
april
1,
1960
for
the
felony
murder
of
one
syder
george
brown,
a
fence
and
gambler.
at
the
trial,
the
principal
evidence
against
them
was
a
set
of
confessions
which
admitted
that
syder
george
brown
had
been
killed
during
the
course
of
an
attempted
robbery.
at
the
trial,
the
boys
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
the
confessions
were
false
and
had
been
obtained
by
threats
and
abuse.
the
truth
was,
the
petitioner
explained,
that
syder
brown
had
been
killed
accidentally
during
an
innocent
attempt
to
pawn
a
shotgun
with
him.
now
the
jury
convicted,
the
boys,
were
sentenced
to
death
which
was
the
mandatory
sentence
for
felony
murder
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time.
thereafter
shortly,
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
counsel
who
had
participated
in
the
case
was
not
a
lawyer
at
all
but
an
imposter,
one
daniel
oliver
wendellholmes
morgan
who
had
substituted
himself
for
one
l.a.
harris,
a
real
lawyer
who
had
left
the
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
immediately
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
receive
and
grant
motions
for
a
new
trial.
but
the
boys
sitting
down
in
the
district
jail
on
death
row
refused
to
file
such
motions
and
repudiated
them
when
they
were
filed
on
their
behalf
by
the
court
appointed
counsel
because
the
boys
did
not
want
to
waive
their
right
to
be
tried
but
once
for
the
same
crime.
there
the
matter
sat
for
a
number
of
months
until
the
court
of
appeals
eventually
ordered
a
new
trial
for
the
boys
despite
their
refusal
to
ask
for
it.
at
the
second
trial,
again,
the
confessions
were
introduced.
again,
the
boys
took
the
stand.
again,
they
were
convicted,
only
this
time
they
were
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
the
mandatory
death
sentence
in
the
district
of
columbia
having
meanwhile
been
abolished.
there
followed
an
appeal
and
the
case
was
argued
challenging
--
basically
challenging
the
admission
of
the
confessions
that
have
been
used
against
him
in
some
other
points.
it
was
argued
in
december
of
1963.
there
the
matter
sat
for
some
18
months
until
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
motion
ordered
rehearing
en
banc
sua
sponte
on
the
question
of
the
admission
of
one
of
the
petitioner's
confessions.
case
was
reargued
and
some
six
months
later
or
two
years
after
the
original
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
a
decision
holding
all
of
the
confessions
inadmissible
because
they
had
been
illegally
obtained.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
there
was
no
reason
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
he
said
that
the
--
he
said
that
the
lengthy
opinions
and
the
amount
of
deliberation
that
went
into
them
spoke
for
themselves.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
spoke
for
themselves.
he
said
that
the
court
was
accustomed
to
take
in
great
pains
with
difficult
cases
like
this.
now,
there
followed
the
third
trial
which
was
very
brief.
at
the
third
trial
with
the
confessions
gone,
there
was
no
real
evidence
of
felony
murder,
but
the
prosecutor
supplied
that
lack
by
reading
the
testimony
given
by
the
boys
to
rebut
the
illegally
obtained
and
inadmissible
confessions
at
the
second
trial.
he
also
had
three
live
witnesses
and
he
read
some
other
testimony
from
the
second
trial,
but
this
other
testimony
didn't
really
make
out
a
case
of
felony
murder
and
if
that
had
been
all
there
was
to
it,
the
case
might
have
been
dismissed.
certainly,
it
should
have
been.
it
was
as
to
one
of
the
defendants,
samson.
but
orson
white
and
eddie
harrison
were
reconvicted
on
the
basis
of
their
testimony
given
at
the
second
trial
to
rebut
the
illegally
obtained
and
inadmissible
confessions.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
they
did
not
take
the
stand
and
objected
vigorously
to
the
use
of
their
testimony
from
the
former
trial.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
actually,
there
were
more
than
one
objection
and
there
was
some
discussion
to
this
actually
in
the
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
that
was
at
the
outside
--
at
the
outset
of
the
testimony,
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
were
two
objections,
one
objection
when
the
government
started
to
read
white's
testimony
then
again
when
they
started
to
read
harrison's
testimony,
then
again
during
the
reading
of
harrison's
testimony
and
then
again
at
the
end.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
65
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes.
judge
kern
wasn't
listening
to
argument
on
that
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
judge
kern
wasn't
listening
to
argument
on
that
objection.
we
had
raised
that
before
at
the
outset
when
mr.
white
--
when
his
testimony
was
being
read,
too.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
now,
that
is
not
in
this
joint
appendix.
it
is
in
the
transcript
however.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
if
i
don't
stand
on
the
word
“vigor”,
your
honor,
in
the
objection,
there
was
objection
to
the
reading
of
the
testimony
and
the
court
understood.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
your
honor,
he
certainly
knew
what
it
was
before
that
was
--
after
it
had
been
read,
there's
no
question
about
that
if
you
turn
to
page
65.
he
said
specifically
the
fifth
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
has
been
given
judicially
before
it's
available
to
the
government.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
when
he
did
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
precise
constitutional
question,
he
promptly
overruled
it
and
he
could
have
at
that
time
ruled
the
testimony
out
if
he
had
been
overviewed
to
entertain
an
objection
on
that
ground,
but
he
wasn't
at
all.
he
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
no.
then,
he
would
have
dismissed
the
case
as
he
did
against
samson
because
then,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
case
because
the
case
was
the
testimony
of
the
boys
and
precious
little
else.
now,
the
government
defends
the
use
of
this
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
voluntarily
given,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
can
really
contend
that
consider
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
given.
the
confessions
--
here
were
these
confessions
that
admitted
guilt
clearly.
the
boys
had
objected
that
they
were
false
and
should
not
be
and
had
been
obtained
by
threats
and
abuse.
the
judge
had
ruled
that
they
were
to
go
to
the
jury.
the
boys
had
already
been
convicted
once
and
spent
22
months
on
death
row
on
account
of
those
confessions.
they
knew
they
were
going
to
be
convicted.
if
they
got
on
the
stand,
they
might
not
have
a
very
good
chance
but
if
they
didn't
get
on
the
stand,
they
had
no
chance
at
all.
they
were
faced
with
certain
conviction
and
possible
death
and
they
knew
it.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
petitioner
was
18.
by
the
time
of
this
trial,
he
was
about
21.
now,
there
was
only
one
chance
and
that
was
to
go
before
that
jury
and
try
to
persuade
them
that
the
confessions
were
false
and
to
give
them
the
boys'
own
story,
incriminating
as
that
was.
and
so,
he
took
the
stand
but
i
don't
see
how
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
could
be
considered
voluntary.
he
testified
but
only
under
great
and
improper
pressure,
improper
because
it
stemmed
from
illegally
obtained
evidence
erroneously
admitted.
and
i
think
to
use
testimony
obtained
in
those
circumstances
is
fundamentally
wrong.
when
eddie
harrison
was
awarded
a
new
trial
almost
five
and
a
half
years
after
he
had
first
been
imprisoned
for
this
offense,
the
least
he
was
entitled
to
was
a
fair
trial
and
he
didn't
get
it.
what
he
got
instead
was
a
trial
at
which
he
was
made
the
government
star
witness
against
his
will
with
words
extracted
from
him
by
the
use
of
illegally
obtained
evidence.
i
don't
see
how
a
conviction
so
obtained
can
be
squared
with
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
under
the
decision
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
so
i
think
the
conviction
must
be
reversed,
but
that
is
not
enough.
the
indictment
against
him
should
also
be
dismissed
because
of
the
long
delay
in
this
case.
it
is
now
more
than
eight
years
since
the
original
indictment
in
this
case
and
eddie
harrison
has
been
in
jail
all
that
time.
eight
years
is
a
long
time
to
anyone.
it's
particularly
long
to
someone
as
young
as
eddie
harrison
that's
almost
a
third
of
his
life.
it
is
all
of
his
adult
life.
an
examination
of
the
record
shows
that
this
great
delay
was
occasioned
largely
by
the
failure
of
the
judicial
machinery
to
function
well
and
expeditiously,
and
the
failure
was
greatest
in
the
court
of
appeals.
five
of
those
eight
years
nearly
have
been
spent
on
appeals,
four
of
them
on
court
deliberations
alone,
and
two
years
on
that
one
occasion
between
the
original
argument
and
final
decision
and
at
that
starting
some
three
and
a
half
years
after
the
case,
it
already
begun
and
when
speedy
trial
had
been
argued
to
them
already.
now,
i
understand
and
i
would
not
dispute
that
the
right
of
a
speedy
trial
is
necessarily
relative
that
it
must
depend
someone
on
the
circumstances
that
it's
consistent
with
due
deliberation
and
an
undue
haste
is
not
required.
but
when
all
that
has
been
said,
sometime,
somewhere,
somehow
the
right
and
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
has
to
be
given
meaning
and
effect.
the
word
speedy
can
only
be
stretched
so
far
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
stretched
it
way
beyond
the
breaking
point
when
it
justified
the
long
delays
in
this
case.
at
least
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
must
guard
against
delays
that
are
unreasonable
or
unnecessary,
and
the
delays
in
this
case
were
both.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
any
way
for
this
to
have
been
raised
by
habeas
corpus.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
it
was
pending
at
all
times
that
the
court
of
appeals
were
sitting
down
there
to
decide
it.
i
suppose
habeas
corpus
might
lie
and
it
would
be
a
little
difficult
when
they
might
be
coming
out
with
a
decision
any
day.
the
case
has
been
argued,
submitted.
all
it
needs
is
the
judge
to
make
up
his
mind.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
i
think
he
does
have,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes.
i
don't
know
of
a
stage
of
this
particular
proceeding
where
it
would
have
been
appropriate,
but
certainly
habeas
corpus
is
an
appropriate
way
to
raise
a
question.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
hesitate
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
district
court
cases
and
any
number
of
cases
raising
precisely
that
question
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
on
much
shorter
periods
of
time
than
we're
talking
about
here
and
there
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
now,
the
government
on
brief
contends
that
there
is
another
standard
here
that
it
is
an
essential
element
of
a
claim
to
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
that
the
petitioner
show
that
his
actual
trial,
his
defense
was
prejudice
in
some
way.
that
it
seems
to
me
almost
changes
the
word
“speedy”
to
“fair”.
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is
that
as
long
as
he
ultimately
got
a
fair
trial,
never
mind
the
delay.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
cases
that
the
government
has
cited
stand
for
that
proposition
and
i
don't
think
that
the
word
“speedy”
can
be
stretched
or
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
stretched
to
mean
that,
but
even
if
it
could,
i
think
that
there
was
definite
prejudice
to
the
defense
in
this
case.
because
of
the
long
delay,
many
of
the
witnesses
were
no
longer
available.
somewhere
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
the
government
witnesses.
as
a
result,
the
defendants
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
these
witnesses.
now,
the
government
said
that
doesn't
matter
because
they
had
the
opportunity
at
the
second
trial,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
thing
at
all.
and
when
the
u.s.
attorney
stood
up
there
reading
in
a
very
authoritative
fashion
all
this
old
testimony
about
this
old
crime
and
when
the
jury
found
out
from
that
reading
that
these
defendants
had
already
been
tried
at
least
twice
and
had
spent
several
years
in
jail
on
account
of
this
very
killing,
they
were
almost
found
the
same,
that
the
defendants
were
guilty.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
your
honor,
there
were
two
things
that
were
held
to
be
their
own
fault.
first,
the
government
contended
and
the
court
below
held
that
when
these
boys
--
that
the
whole
delay
that
was
occasioned
by
their
refusal
to
seek
the
second
trial
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
willing
to
give
them
was
their
own
fault
because
they
should
have
asked
for
that.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
waive
their
double
jeopardy
claim
in
order
to
get
the
speedy
trial
that
everybody
knew
they
had
coming.
now,
the
government
here
says
in
answer
to
that
that
they
could
have
had
both,
that
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
for
a
new
trial
and
maintain
their
double
jeopardy
claim,
but
the
government
argued
exactly
the
opposite
when
they
were
down
there
on
death
row
faced
with
that
choice.
at
that
time,
the
government
was
saying
that
you
shouldn't
give
them
a
new
trial
unless
they
ask
for
it
because
they'll
have
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
so
that's
one
of
the
delays
that
these
folks
fall.
other
delays
that
are
attributed
to
these
people
and
were
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
erroneously
involves
the
time
after
the
court
of
appeals
finally
made
up
its
mind
to
go
ahead
and
give
them
another
trial
anyway
even
though
they
wouldn't
ask
for
it
and
the
time
when
that
trial
was
actually
held.
now,
that
period
of
time
on
page
8
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
we
have
all
the
dates
pretty
well
laid
out,
that
period
of
time
was
between
june
12,
1962
when
the
first
conviction
was
vacated
and
the
case
was
remanded
until
the
trial,
which
took
place
in
april
22.
now,
that
period
of
time,
there
was
one
month
that
we're
willing
to
say
might
be
attributable
to
the
petitioner
has
counsel.
he
asked
for
a
30-day
delay
in
order
to
obtain
a
transcript
to
the
first
trial.
now,
whether
the
need
to
get
a
transcript
in
the
form
of
proffers
case
is
properly
attributable
or
accounted
against
the
prisoner,
i
don't
know.
but
we
have
--
but
that's
all
of
the
time
that
was
really
attributable
to
him.
and
actually
in
our
discussion
of
this
point
and
particularly
the
reply
brief,
we
have
dealt
rather
fully
with
that
period
of
time.
it
begins
on
page
7
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
in
the
second
trial?
at
the
second
trial,
each
of
the
defendants
testified
--
one
other
witness
testified
that
i
know
of
in
connection
with
the
petitioner,
harrison,
and
i
believe
that
petitioner
samson
may
also
have
has
some
testimony
by
his
relatives
considering
--
concerning
his
appearance.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
they
were
not.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
first
they
were
kept
in
jail
for
eight
years
without
yet
having
a
fair
trial.
the
sheer
incarceration
for
eight
years
is
a
bit
of
time
and
they
were
under
considerable
duress.
then
beyond
that,
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
no,
it
only
affected
the
prisoners.
now,
it
related
to
the
trial
in
this
way.
when
the
thing
actually
got
around
to
being
tried
the
last
time,
the
prosecuting
witnesses
were
even
gone.
and
when
the
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
bit
of
difference.
he
just
read
their
testimony
right
out
of
the
transcript
of
the
last
trial
and
that
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
oh,
well,
i
think
that
the
effect
--
well,
any
prejudice
that
stemmed
from
the
delay
is
part
of
the
speedy
trial
in
question,
and
this
prejudice
stemmed
from
the
delay.
but
for
the
delay,
the
witnesses
would
have
been
there.
we
would
have
people
cross-examined,
not
some
u.s.
attorney
standing
up
there
reading
in
a
very
--
it
carried
the
force
and
the
weight
of
the
u.s.
attorney
when
he
read
it.
he
read
it
very
well.
and
not
only
that,
but
the
mere
fact
of
the
reading
and
from
the
actual
words
read,
it
became
known
to
the
jury
that
these
boys
had
been
in
jail
for
several
years.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
he
did.
this
is
a
kind
of
prejudice
that
came
from
the
delay.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
look
at
page
48,
your
honor,
here
that
mr.
epstein
starts
reading.
question:
“will
you
state
your
name?”
answer:
“eddie
mcarthur
harrison.”
question:
“you
have
been
at
the
dc
jail
for
several
years,
is
the
correct?”
answer:
“yes,
sir.”
then
he
interrupts
the
reading
and
he
says,
“this
testimony
was
given
on
may
3,
1963.”
the
jury
didn't
miss
the
point
that
as
early
as
may
3,
1963,
he
was
given
testimony
in
this
case
and
he
had
already
been
in
jail
for
several
years.
i
think
there
was
a
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defense,
but
i
don't
think
that's
an
essential
element
of
a
crime
of
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
he
was
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
without
regard
--
i
can
imagine
a
case
in
which
there
would
be
no
defense,
there
would
be
no
harm
to
the
defense
if
it
was
surely
a
documentary
case.
obviously
it
could
go
on
forever,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
person
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
and
it
certainly
wouldn't
change
the
sixth
amendment
command.
so
in
sum
then,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
just
want
to
urge
that
the
conviction
be
reversed
and
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed
because
the
petitioner
has
been
illegally
convicted
and
wrongfully
held
for
far
too
long.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
is
an
even
stronger
case
than
the
simmons
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
testimony
given
in
support
of
an
unsuccessful
motion
to
suppress
could
not
be
used
against
the
defendant.
now,
here
the
testimony
was
given
to
rebut
admittedly
inadmissible
evidence
illegally
obtained,
whereas
there
it
was
just
given
in
an
effort
to
show
that
it
was
inadmissible
evidence,
and
an
unsuccessful
effort
at
that.
now,
it
seems
to
me
far
wrong
for
the
government
5617
and
far
worse
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
use
the
testimony
in
the
simmons
case
--
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
it
was
the
tension
--
i'm
not
going
to
debate
with
you,
your
honor.
i
thought
--
opinion
says.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
yes,
i
have,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
it's
certainly
a
distinction,
but
here
there's
a
little
tension
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
principal
contention
of
the
petitioners
at
the
second
trial
was
that
these
confessions
were
obtained
in
violation
of
their
fifth
amendment
rights.
they
testified
that
they
were
obtained
by
threats
and
by
abuse,
and
that
the
only
point
in
which
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
between
eddie
harrison
and
the
police
office
who
investigated
--
the
police
officer
who
testified
to
the
contrary
and
obtained
the
confession,
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
turned
out
to
be
wrong
and
eddie
harrison
turned
out
to
be
telling
the
truth.
now,
there's
no
use
arguing
that
those
aren't
voluntary
confessions
anymore
because
the
jury
resolved
that
question
against
him.
but
the
point
is
that
they
were
getting
on
the
stand
to
say
that
to
claim
a
fifth
amendment
right,
to
say
that
these
were
compelled
confessions
and
they
were
false.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
argument
--
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
government
was
saying,
“well
look,
these
fellows
were
lucky
to
win
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
juvenile
court
blanc
because
that
really
wasn't
much
of
a
point.”
but
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
escobedo
there,
too.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
that
boy
wouldn't
sit
still
to
rest
on
the
objection
to
those
confessions
sitting
there.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
well,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
he
wasn't
advised
by
counsel,
but
that
boy
was
under
strong
compulsion
to
testify.
he
was
fresh
off
death
row,
22
months
there.
mr.
alfred
v.
j.
prather
that's
right
if
those
confessions
didn't
--
are
held
not
to
have
caused
him
in
any
way
to
take
the
stand,
or
if
his
testimony
can
be
said
to
be
completely
independent
of
it
and
not
the
fruit
of
the
introduction
of
those
confessions,
then
of
course
we
have
no
case.
but
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
separated,
and
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
pope
case
which
was
identically
this
case.
and
they
said
that
the
testimony
was
compelled
by
the
confessions
that
couldn't
be
used
and
it
could
never
be
used.
i
don't
see
--
we
can
look
some
more
at
the
circumstances
or
the
taking
of
those
confessions.
it
wasn't
just
--
this
was
not
some
little
minor
technical
point.
this
wasn't
the
most
innocent
of
errors.
those
police
knew
they
were
violating
mallory,
at
least
the
u.s.
attorney
did
when
it
got
time
to
arguing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
confessed
error.
it
shouldn't
have.
they
shouldn't
have
held
samson
for
two
years.
the
u.s.
attorney
confessed
error
in
his
case,
but
it
sat
up
there
for
two
years,
too.
and
orson
white
was
so
clear
that
the
--
that
there
was
no
problem
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
problem
was
this
one
little
confession
and
that
was
clearly
obtained
in
violation
of
escobedo.
