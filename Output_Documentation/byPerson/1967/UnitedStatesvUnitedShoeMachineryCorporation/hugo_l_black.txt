it's
your
view
that
the
so

contemplated
by

now
reached
the

if
there
are
still
more
erosion
to
take
place?
justice

your
argument
is
then,
as
i
see
it
your
difference
with

is
if
they

eroded
more
up

you
think
it
should
not.
justice

your
view
is
that
if
it

eroded,
it

have
eroded
more,
they
do
have
a
right
to
challenge
the

that
it?

what
i
gathered.
