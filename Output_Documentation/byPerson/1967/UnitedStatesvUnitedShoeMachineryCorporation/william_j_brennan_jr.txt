justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
turner,
may
i
ask
you.
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
we
should
examine
the
original
decree
in
what
was
said
by
judge
wyzanski
before
that
decree
was
entered
and
decide
for
ourselves
whether
he
properly
interpreted
what
he
then
said
was
to
be
achieved
by
the
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
then,
if
we
may
proceed
on
the
premise
that
he
did
or
at
least
at
his
interpretation
of
what
he
made
at
that
time
was
not
an
unreasonable
one
that
is
expressed
today.
if
we
agree
with
that
premise
then
i'd
take
it
that
the
government
did
have
a
burden
to
establish
something
before
you
were
entitled
on
a
hearing
on
suggesting
alternative
remedies,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
back
too
mr.
turner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
question
from
the
chief
justice
earlier,
you
said
several
time,
you
felt
the
government
was
improperly
denied
a
hearing
like
other
hearing
in
the
sense
has
two
kinds
isn't
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
one
--
certainly,
you
had
some
kind
of
burden
before
you're
entitled
to
be
heard
on
alternative
remedies.
you
have
to
show
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
now,
there's
no
question
that
in
terms
of
the
government's
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
on
that
issue,
the
government
is
not
suggesting
that
it
wasn't
given
a
full
opportunity
it
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
that
really
on
the
merits
of
that
issue
judge
wyzanski
decided
the
merits
against
you,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
where
do
you
get
that
standard?
from
where
did
that
standard,
i'm
going
to
admit
from
what
his
conception
of
what
he
had
intended
by
his
original
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'll
come
back
to
the
question,
is
the
government
asking
us
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
the
government
asking
us
now
to
go
back
and
decide
whether
judge
wyzanski
was
right
or
wrong
in
the
way
that
he
interpreted
what
he
intended
at
the
end
of
the
original
decree?
justice
william
j.
