there
was
no
discussion,
was
there
i
suppose,
for
the
opinion
of
the
decree
as
such?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
turner,
in
your
wide
experience,
have
you
ever
seen
a
provision
on
an
antitrust
decree
like
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
seen
some
of
them
in
consent
decrees
that
approximated
this
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
a
litigated
case,
this
is
a
new
one
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
in
consent
decrees.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
position
did
united
take
on
the
original
appeal
here
with
regard
to
this
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
didn't
have
this
provision,
do
you
think
you
would
be
able
to
come
as
for
this
modification?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
time
your
going
to
talk
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing
are
you
going
to
suppose
would
it
find
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
where
i
understood
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
carson,
can
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
question.
i'd
like
to
ask
a
questions,
compared
from
the
one
i've
just
been
reading,
the
one
you
answered
to
–
is
the
problem
self-constricted
in
some
way
by
swift?
either
that
you
might
have
reached
different
conclusions
or
that
you
might
have
brought
in
there
other
considerations.
now
assuming
that
you
accepted
in
swift
that
there
is
no
real
term
on
this
problem,
this
case
goes
back
to
relieve
that
is
to
ask
you
the
secondhand
--
is
there
more
evidence
that
either
you
or
the
government
is
considering?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
you
can
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
government's
attorney
would
probably
answer
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
take
this
case
simply
on
the
basis
whether
the
finding
of
the
fact
of
the
judge
are
adequate
that
might
be
granted
further
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
what
the
issue
is
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
if
you're
right,
unless
your
position
really
comes
down
to,
as
i
understand
it
is
given
the
findings
of
the
district
judge,
really
the
only
issue
is
that
there
should
be
a
reconsideration
of
the
original
denial
of
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
it
comes
down
to?
