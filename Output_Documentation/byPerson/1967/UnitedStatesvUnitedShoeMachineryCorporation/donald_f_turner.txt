mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
to
the
district
of
massachusetts
in
denying
the
government's
petition
to
modify
the
antitrust
decree
which
is
entered
in
1953
after
an
adjudication
that
the
united
shoe
machinery
corporation
had
unlawfully
monopolized
the
manufacture
of
shoe
machinery
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
in
the
earlier
proceeding,
the
court
found
that
united
was
supplying
over
75%
and
probably
around
85%
of
the
current
demand
in
the
american
shoe
machinery
market,
that
this
constituted
monopoly
power
and
that
the
position
of
such
power
violated
section
2
because
it
was
not
attributable
solely
to
defendant's
ability,
economies
of
scale,
research
or
natural
advantages.
the
court
found
that
united's
monopoly
power
was
also
attributable
in
short
to
practices
which
though
not
necessarily
unlawful
in
and
of
themselves
were
exclusionary
of
actual
and
potential
competition.
most
prominent
of
these
practices
was
united's
leasing
system
whereby
it
refused
to
sell
many
of
its
machines
and
required
long-term
leases
which
obligate
or
pressured
lessees
to
use
united's
machinery
regularly
and
over
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
in
fashioning
its
remedies,
the
district
court
described
the
purpose
of
an
antitrust
decree
in
an
unlawful
monopolization
case
as
follows,
and
i
quote,
“where
a
defendant
has
monopolized
commerce
in
violation
of
section
2,
the
principal
objects
of
the
decrees
are
to
extirpate
practices
where
that
have
caused
or
may
hereafter
cause
monopolization
and
to
restore
workable
competition
in
the
market.”
the
court
rejected
the
request
by
the
government
that
united
be
divided
into
three
equal
sized
shoe
machinery
manufacturing
firms.
united
conducted
all
manufacturing
in
--
of
shoe
machines
in
one
plant
in
beverly,
massachusetts,
the
court
concluded
that
the
government
had
not
shown
that
the
kind
of
divestiture
it
sought
was
realistic
or
feasible
in
such
circumstances.
the
court
also
declined
to
order
a
prohibition
of
all
leasing
by
united
which
hence
finally
the
government
itself
had
not
requested.
the
court
found
that
in
the
circumstances,
particularly
the
likelihood
that
many,
if
not,
most
shoe
manufacturers
could
not
afford
purchase,
such
a
restriction
would
be
undesirable,
at
least
until
milder
remedies
had
been
tried.
instead,
the
court
imposed
a
variety
of
conditions
and
restrictions
upon
--
upon
united's
activities
designed,
and
i
quote,
“to
recreate
and
independent
market.”
these
included
an
injunction
against
monopolizing
and
requirement
that
united
offer
for
sale
at
comparable
terms
all
the
machines
that
it
leases,
that
certain
restrictive
clauses
be
eliminated
from
the
leases
and
they
run
for
no
more
than
five
years,
that
the
united
dispose
of
facilities
for
the
manufacture
of
various
sundry
items,
that
it
charged
separately
for
servicing,
that
it
issues
a
reasonable
royalty
licenses
to
any
applicant
or
on
all
patents
held
by
it,
and
a
few
other
clauses
which
i
shall
not
mention.
now,
the
decree
contained
the
usual
retention
of
jurisdiction
clause
providing
that
jurisdiction
be
retained,
and
i
quote,
“for
the
purpose
of
enabling
either
of
the
parties
to
apply
to
this
court
at
any
time
for
such
further
orders
and
directions
as
may
be
appropriate,
or
the
correction,
construction
or
carrying
out
of
this
decree,
and
to
set
aside
the
decree
and
take
further
proceedings,
if
future
developments
justified
that
course
in
the
appropriate
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
act.
that
was
paragraph
23
of
the
decree.
in
addition
however,
paragraph
18
of
the
decree
provided
that
ten
years
after
its
entry,
and
again
i
quote,
“both
parties
shall
report
to
this
court
the
effect
of
this
decree
and
may
then
petition
for
its
modification
in
view
of
its
effect
in
establishing
workable
competition.
if
either
party
takes
advantage
of
this
paragraph
by
filing
a
petition,
each
such
petition
shall
be
accompanied
by
affidavit
setting
forth
the
then
structure
of
the
shoe
machinery
market
and
defendant's
power
within
that
market.”
united
appealed
this
decree
attacking
both
the
findings
and
the
decree
itself.
the
government
did
not
appeal
and
after
oral
argument,
this
court
affirmed
for
corium
simply
stating
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
justified
by
the
evidence
and
support
of
the
decree.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
now,
on
january
1,
1965
acting
under
paragraph
18
of
the
decree,
which
i've
just
quoted,
united
states
reported
to
the
district
court
that
in
its
view,
united
retained
a
dominant
share
of
the
market
and
that
workable
competition
had
not
been
established
in
the
shoe
machinery
industry
and
accordingly
petitioned
for
additional
relief.
united
cross-petitioned
to
be
relieved
from
certain
provisions
of
the
decree.
in
our
position
--
in
our
petition,
we
ask
that
united
be
required
to
submit
a
plan
under
which
it
would
establish
an
independent
full
line
shoe
machinery
manufacturing
company
capable
of
competing
with
the
defendant
in
the
shoe
machinery
market,
to
hold
hearings,
to
assure
that
such
a
plan
was
feasible
and
equitable,
would
not
result
in
a
forfeiture
to
defend
stockholders,
and
promised
a
fair
chance
of
said
company
being
able
to
compete
with
defendant,
and
to
grant
such
other
and
further
relief
as
might
be
necessary
to
establish
workable
competition
in
the
market.
united
on
the
other
hand
asked
for
a
determination
that
workable
competition
of
the
shoe
machinery
and
shoe
machinery
had
now
been
established
and
that
the
decree
accordingly
be
revised
to
retain
only
those
provisions
requiring
united
to
sell
on
comparable
terms,
as
well
as
leases
machines
to
charge
separately
for
installation
and
servicing
and
to
avoid
in
its
leases
certain
of
the
restrictive
clauses
that
the
court
had
earlier
enjoyed.
after
hearing
the
district
court
on
april
11,
1967
denied
both
petitions,
at
the
outset
of
its
opinion,
the
court
citing
united
states
versus
swift
&
company
286
us
106
stated
that
its
original
decree
could
not
be
changed
unless
the
government
made
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
invoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
the
court
found
that
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
contemplated
nothing
beyond
that
standard
and
conferred
no
broader
authority
on
the
power
of
the
court
to
honor
its
decree.
when
read
in
light
of
its
original
opinion,
the
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“the
object
of
the
decree
was
during
a
ten-year
period
not
to
restore
so-called
workable
competition
but
to
move
toward
establishing
it.”
thus,
the
court
said
it
was
simply
inviting
information
as
to
how
successful
the
decree
had
been
in
gradually
eroding,
and
that's
the
court's
phrase,
united's
1953
power
to
monopolize
the
market.
the
court
made
16
findings
of
fact
from
which
it
concluded
that
the
decree
was
working
as
had
been
originally
contemplated
in
the
way
i
just
described.
it
found
that
united
now
received
62%
of
total
machinery
revenues
as
against
probably
85%
prior
to
the
decree.
it
considered
this
change
satisfactory.
in
light
of
such
further
findings
as
to
the
growth
of
united's
competitors,
the
condition
of
the
secondhand
market,
new
competitive
processes
and
the
entry
of
new
narrow
line
companies.
the
court
found
that
united
had
no
exclusionary
power
over
the
minor
machines
and
that
if
the
shoe
machinery
industry
were
divided
into
seven
submarkets
corresponding
to
the
seven
stages
of
shoe
manufacturing,
it
was
not
clear
that
united
had
a
dominant
position
in
the
industry.
even
if
united
did,
the
court
found
this
was
not
due
to
restraints
of
trade
but
to
united's
large
funds,
white
context,
superior
products,
skill
and
merchandising,
efficiency,
conventions
and
know-how.
the
court
also
stated
that
all
what
it
described
as
artificial
barriers
to
entry
had
been
terminated
and
it
said
that
if
competition
was
not
flourishing
in
some
sectors
of
the
market,
it
was
because
no
competitor
with
large
financial
resources
had
entered
yet.
this
was
found
to
be
so
because
the
rate
of
return
on
shoe
machinery
is
unattractive
as
compared
with
other
machinery
markets.
and
so,
the
court
concluded
that
the
decree
was
still
working
in
its
long
range
task
of
freeing
the
market
from
united's
monopolization
and
keeping
the
door
open
for
an
adequately
provided
challenger.
accordingly,
it
rejected
united's
position
as
well
as
the
government's
stating
that
until
there
are
competitors
throughout
the
market,
the
decree
should
stand
unmodified.
now,
since
the
court
by
pretrial
order
had
decided
to
allow
evidence
on
relief,
only
if
it
decided
that
some
modification
of
the
decree
was
necessary,
no
evidence
on
the
appropriateness
or
feasibility
of
further
relief
was
introduced.
now,
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
government's
position
very
briefly
as
follows.
because
the
decree
after
ten
years
has
merely
eroded
some
of
united's
market
power
and
has
left
most
of
it
intact,
the
government
was
entitled
at
the
least
to
a
hearing
on
the
feasibility
and
effectiveness
of
further
relief.
the
court's
refusal
to
make
that
hearing
available
was
based
in
our
opinion
upon
an
erroneous
conception
of
the
government's
right
to
seek
modifications
of
the
decree,
particularly,
although
we
do
not
necessarily
rely
on
this
in
light
of
paragraph
18.
now,
as
the
court
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
we
are
not
there
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
i
think
i
--
i
would
like
to
be
very
careful
on
answering
that
question.
we
are
not
claiming
that
there
is
unlawful
monopolization
in
the
legal
sense.
we
are
not
conceded
that
the
power
that
united
still
retains
in
the
market
is
not
monopoly
pa
--
is
not
monopoly
power.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
for
all
that
we
know,
united
has
not
violated
the
antitrust
law
since
the
entry
of
the
decree,
so
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
62%
would
not
warrant
a
new
antitrust
--
a
new
sherman
act
case,
that
is
correct.
now,
we're
not
--
if
i
may
continue
a
little
on
this
--
we
are
not
here
disputing
the
proposition
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
to
enter
the
decree
that
it
did
at
the
time
that
it
did,
even
though
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
on
that
appeal,
the
decree
was
notable
for
its
moderation.
but
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
the
decree
has
failed
to
accomplish
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
the
basic
purpose
adverted
to
by
the
district
court
in
1953
of
eradicating
united's
monopoly
power
and
restoring
effective
competition
to
the
shoe
machinery
market.
now,
we
of
course
agree
that
the
decree
in
the
passage
of
time
have
had
a
non-insignificant
event.
united's
market
share
in
the
aggregate
has
been
reduced
from
what
was
estimated
in
1953
to
be
over
75,
probably
85%
of
the
market
to
down
around
62%,
taking
the
measure
which
the
district
judge
found
and
we
think
correctly
most
appropriate,
that
is
united
share
of
shoe
machinery
revenues.
there
have
indeed
been
a
substantial
number
of
new
entrances
into
the
business
by
small,
single
and
limited
line
companies.
and
generally
speaking,
alternatives
available
to
shoe
manufacturers
have
been
widened
by
among
other
things
that
develop
on
a
new
competitive
process.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
like
paragraph
18
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
mr.
justice?
there
have
been
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
we
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
say,
mr.
justice,
that
my
experience
is
way
too
limited
to
answer
that
question.
we
do
know
of
one
provision
comparable
to
this
which
appeared
in
a
consent
decree
which
was
substituted
for
a
litigated
decree
in
the
old
international
harvester
case.
there
may
have
been
others.
i
simply
do
not
know.
we
have
as
you
suggest,
though
within
recent
years,
included
--
well,
actually
some
much
more
specific
kinds
of
reopening
clauses
in
consent
decrees.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
consent
decrees,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
would
and
i
would
say
that
the
entitlement
of
the
government
to
endeavor
to
remedy
a
defective
decree
is
clearly
superior
when
it
comes
after
litigation
and
adjudication
of
liability.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
i
would
like
--
but
let
me
complete
my
answer,
let
me
say
this,
that
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
in
a
consent
decree
there
has
been
no
litigation
or
determination
of
liability,
it
would
be
somewhat
unfair
to
permit
the
government
to
come
in
and
substantially
augment
that
decree
again
without
having
had
to
establish
liability
which
indeed
as
you
know
most
consent
decrees
specifically
negate.
and
so,
there's
no
finding
as
to
liability.
i
would
add
to
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
a
somewhat
different
point
that
if
the
government
elected
some
ten
years
after
having
entered
into
a
consent
decree
which
is
proved
entirely
inadequate
either
to
come
in
and
be
prepared
to
litigate
liability
in
that
case
or
to
file
completely
a
new
case
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
do
so,
that
there
would
certainly
be
no
legal
bar.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
any
substantial
amendment.
i
have
--
you
know,
there
have
been
some
--
as
you
know,
some
cases
like
the
automobile
financing
case
that's
chrysler
and
ford
where
the
amendment
requested
with
at
least
in
one
case
deemed
modest
enough,
enough
within
what
would
have
the
parties
seem
to
have
as
a
purpose
of
the
decree
to
get
a
minor
modification.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it's
substantial
to
say
to
add
a
divestiture
provision
on
top
of
a
consent
decree,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
with
regard
to
what
the
decree
has
done
in
here,
we
feel
it
measured
against
the
standard
of
eradicating
monopoly
power
or
restoring
workable
competition
despite
what
the
decree
has
done,
which
i
briefly
summarized.
its
effect
can
only
be
described
as
modest
and
largely
unsuccessful.
united
remains
by
all
odds
the
dominant
firm
in
the
industry
as
the
district
court's
findings
and
the
record
plainly
show.
it
has
62%
of
the
market
taken
as
a
whole
and
its
share
of
so-called
major
machines
were
--
was
described
by
the
district
court
as
far
higher
than
its
share
of
minor
machines,
so
that
we
can
assume
the
percentages
run
higher
there.
the
shares
of
its
nearest
competitors
are
approximately
9%
and
7%
respectively.
together,
those
two
competitors
in
other
words
account
for
barely
more
than
one
quarter
of
the
market
share
of
united.
united
offers
115
types
of
machines
on
current
terms
plus
24
on
application;
its
two
leading
competitors
offer
only
22
and
5
respectively.
now,
i
think
we
should
also
note
that
it
has
taken
10
years
to
achieve
the
rather
modest
success
the
decree
has
had.
and
there's
no
guarantee
that
its
success
to
date
will
be
continued
in
the
future.
the
past
trends
could
well
be
reversed
given
united's
still
disproportionate
size
and
broad
machine
coverage
as
compared
to
that
of
any
of
its
competitors
and
given
the
fact
that
if
the
district
court's
judgment
is
upheld,
united
will
be
finally
relieved
of
any
significant
threat
of
more
effective
relief
in
the
future.
but
i
would
note
that
even
if
we
assume
that
united's
market
share
would
continue
to
decline
that
approximately
the
same
rate
as
in
the
past,
it
would
still
hold
over
40%
of
the
market
and
then
after
20
years
from
the
date
of
the
decree
with
little
reason
for
great
confidence
that
by
that
time,
any
of
its
competitors
would
have
grown
to
the
point
of
offering
a
serious
across
the
board
challenge.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
all
you
have,
mr.
justice,
is
a
contention
on
our
part
that
the
judge
should
proceed
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
what
additional
forms
of
relief
there
might
be
that
would
be
feasible
and
appropriate
and
not
more
destructive
than
they
would
be
beneficial
that
that's
our
position.
now,
we
would
--
with
regard
to
what
the
decree
has
done,
i
think
this
question
might
fairly
be
raised
that
if
it
had
been
predictable
at
the
time
the
decree
was
entered
that
in
ten
years,
united
would
still
occupy
the
dominant
position
that
it
has,
could
it
have
been
persuasively
contended
at
that
time
if
you
could
have
predicted
that
that
the
decree
provided
for
adequate
relief,
and
we
think
clearly
it
could
not.
now,
we
then
come
to
the
question,
did
the
district
court
apply
an
appropriate
standard
in
concluding
that
no
modification
of
the
decree
need
even
be
considered,
and
we
urge
that
the
court
was
clearly
wrong.
as
i
have
noted,
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
formula
of
the
swift
case
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
well
and
required
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions
before
modification
could
be
decreed.
the
court
further
held
that
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
be
interpreted
to
give
it
more
general
authority.
and
finally
as
you
know,
it
interpreted
the
decree
as
merely
an
inviting
an
inquiry
not
whether
after
ten
years
workable
competition
been
restored
but
whether
it
had
achieved
the
object
of
moving
toward
establishing
workable
competition.
now,
for
the
reasons
stated
in
detail
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
court
misconstrued
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
and
that
it's
1953
opinion
rather
than
supporting
its
present
construction
cuts
the
other
way.
that
was
certainly
the
premise
on
which
the
government
defended
the
decree
on
appeal
in
1953
where
we
set
up
the
decree,
and
i
quote,
“if
proceeded
on
the
premise
that
relatively
mild
remedies
should
be
tried
as
a
first
resort
and
that
the
possibility
of
more
drastic
measures
should
be
held
in
advance.”
and
we
immediately
thereafter
cited
paragraphs
18
and
23
of
the
decree.
and
i
would
like
to
add
that
if
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
paragraph
18
came
as
a
surprise
to
us,
which
it
did,
it
appears
also
to
have
come
to
--
as
a
surprise
to
the
defendant.
neither
its
petition
for
modification
nor
its
briefs
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
carry
any
suggestion
that
paragraph
18
merely
contemplated
and
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
decree
was
successful
in
gradually
eroding
united's
monopoly
power.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
with
regard
to
this
provision,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
it
made
any
specific
attack.
united
attacked
the
finding
of
liability
and
of
course
on
the
basis
of
that
claim,
there
should
be
no
relief
whatsoever.
as
i
said,
i
don't
recall
that
there
as
any
specific
mention
of
this.
now,
even
though
we
think
the
court
misinterpreted
its
own
provision,
it's
not
an
essential
issue.
if
the
swift
formula
is
inapplicable,
inapplicable
to
an
effort
by
the
government
to
supplement
a
decree
that
has
failed
as
materially
as
this
one
has
to
eliminate
a
monopoly
power
that
was
adjudicated
to
a
violated
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and
we
of
course
urge
that
the
swift
formula
should
not
have
been
applied
to
this
kind
of
a
case.
now,
let
me
briefly
summarize
what
swift
was
all
about.
the
defendant
meat
packers
and
that
monopolization
case
had
consented
to
a
decree
enjoining
them
from
selling
meat
at
retail
and
from
manufacturing
wholesaling
or
retailing
a
wide
range
of
non-meat
commodities.
over
a
period
of
ten
years
beginning
shortly
after
the
decree
was
entered,
defendants
had
continuously
though
unsuccessfully
sought
to
have
this
decree
vacated
or
modified
by
the
courts.
and
this
court
rejected
what
was
then
the
last
attempt
in
which
defendant
sought
to
have
the
injunction
modified
to
permit
their
wholesaling
grocery
items.
now,
the
courts
opinion
identified
two
reasons
for
the
decree
hereon
from
the
government's
complaint.
defendants
had
power
to
use
their
distribution
facilities
to
wholesale
unrelated
items
with
substantially
no
increase
in
overhead.
and
of
here,
the
defendants
would
lower
prices
temporarily
to
a
point
that
would
drive
out
competition.
this
court
said
the
decree
had
been
grown
into
theory
that
size
carries
with
it
an
opportunity
for
abuse.
this
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
have
been
utilized
in
the
past.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
developments
in
the
food
industry
would
in
no
way
remove
what
was
described
as
that
ancient
peril.
and
the
court
then
followed
with
the
language
we're
familiar
with
that
the
change
should
be
made
on
nothing
less
than
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice,
yes,
that
even
if
paragraph
18
were
not
in
the
decree
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
come
in
under
the
general
retention
of
jurisdiction
clause
and
seek
modification
when,
if
you
agree
with
us,
a
decree
has
failed
substantially
as
this
one,
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
get
to
later
and
would
be
happy
to
get
to
now.
now,
that's
quite
right.
obviously,
there
must
be
some
limitations
on
the
government's
right
to
come
in.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
are
interest
in
finality
continuous
and
indefinite
and
perpetual
and
certainty
may
adversely
affect
business
decisions.
but
we
don't
think
really
that
there
are
serious
problems
posed
here.
we
think
two
limitations
can
take
care
of
it,
which
i
will
put
rather
simply
in
this
way.
first,
that
the
government
certainly
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
failure
of
the
decree
has
been
evident
and
substantial
to
affect
its
purposes.
and
second,
the
government
must
certainly
petition
for
modification
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
it
can't
wait
forever.
now,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
after
the
decree
was
entered.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
guess
i'll
have
to
be
a
little
more
precise.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
kind
of
right
we
claim
beyond
the
swift
standard.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
here's
what
i
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
a
decree
it
is.
now,
this
particular
decree
here,
mr.
justice,
i
think
--
you
know,
in
fact
paragraph
18
set
a
timetable
for
the
second
look,
ten
years.
now,
given
the
nature
of
the
decree,
the
kinds
of
provisions
that
it
had,
ten
years
would
be
a
rather
reasonable
period
because
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
these
provisions
would
not
have
an
immediate
effect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
little
odd
for
me
as
representing
the
government
not
to
see
such
a
suggestion
but
i
think
it
does
go
a
little
too
far.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it
--
let
me
try
to
--
it's
easier
i
think
to
indicate
a
situation
in
which
it
might
be
deemed
unreasonable
and
whether
it
would
be
reasonable.
let
us
suppose
that
a
particular
decree
was
adopted
to
eliminate
unlawful
fair
trading.
and
it
became
fairly
quickly
apparent
that
the
decree
was
not
doing
that,
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
retailers
were
still
abiding
by
the
manufacturers
apparent
which
is
the
price.
and
suppose
that
became
apparent
within
six
months
after
the
decree
but
the
government
waits
for
ten
years
to
come
in
for
a
modification.
it
seems
to
me
that's
rather
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
i
think
there's
some
obligation
on
the
company
but
certainly
if
it
follows
best
practice
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
come
in
as
soon
as
it
does
become
reasonably
apparent
that
the
decree
is
inadequate
now.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
you're
right.
that's
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i
think
your
statement
is
indeed
more
accurate.
in
other
words,
within
the
reasonable
time
after
there
appears
to
be
reason
for
moving
for
modification.
i
would
agree.
now,
just
to
finish
up
with
regard
the
swift,
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
a
case
that
is
fairly
described
as
one
in
which
the
court
was
putting
--
giving
primary
importance,
paramount
importance
to
the
protection
of
the
public
interest
in
competition.
and
to
turn
that
around
and
to
apply
the
swift
formula
where
the
government
endeavors
to
repair
a
plainly
ineffective
decree,
we
think
it
makes
no
sense.
clearly
the
paramount
public
interest
is
--
in
restoring
competition
is
not
served
by
opposing
upon
the
government
the
enormous
burden
of
making
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
in
short,
by
throwing
all
of
the
benefits
of
the
doubt
against
the
public
interest.
i
think
the
point
would
be
clear,
perfectly
clear
if
swift
were
held
as
a
district
court
rule
to
deprive
district
courts
of
even
the
authority
to
include
in
their
decree
clauses
permitting
reopening
and
further
relief
on
standards
less
severe
than
the
swift
formula
would
impose.
for
that,
we'd
then
force
the
government
and
we
think
district
courts
to
adopt
the
most
drastic
possible
relief
in
each
case
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
public
interest
in
the
restoration
of
workable
competition
would
be
achieved.
indeed,
the
imposition
of
such
hurdles
on
subsequent
strengthening
of
inadequate
decrees
would
destroy
any
basis
for
the
approach
partially
reflected
in
the
original
decree
in
this
case
that
far
reaching
remedies
should
not
be
employed
until
milder
remedies
have
been
tried.
it
would
be
impossible
in
our
position
that
the
public
--
in
terms
of
protecting
the
public
interest
to
maintain
that
doctrine
of
trying
milder
remedies
in
preference
to
harsh
remedies,
and
then
deprive
the
government
or
the
district
court
of
any
power
to
repair
the
decree
whether
this
turned
out
to
be
substantially
defective.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
this
is
about
all
i
have
to
say
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
a
somewhat
different
question.
i
think
there's
certainly
a
heavy
presumption
that
anybody
who
comply
with
a
decree
designed
to
eliminate
unlawful
conduct
or
even
questionable
conduct
is
not
violating
the
law
i
would
say.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
--
i
hesitate
only
because
it's
conceivable
that
a
decree
may
fail
to
prohibit
certain
practices,
which
if
the
defendant
started
following
and
would
make
a
new
case
on
unlawful
monopolization.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we're
not
claiming
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
think
it's
been
variously
formulated
--
i
think
one
is
sort
of,
again,
in
a
negative
way,
it
is
--
you
were
violating
section
2
if
you
have
monopoly
power
and
you
got
it
or
maintaining
it
by
any
other
--
by
any
practices
or
for
any
reasons
other
than
that.
skill
--
you
have
skill
of
foresight
in
industry,
you've
developed
--
you
obtain
lawful
patents
on
new
techniques
and
you're
just
competing
like
people
who
are
supposed
to
compete.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
if
the
price
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
price
level
at
which
he
sells
seems
to
me
irrelevant.
if
he
has
lawful
monopoly
power,
it
doesn't
become
unlawful
merely
because
he
charges
a
high
price
i
think.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
or
--
well,
a
low
price
begins
to
raise
question.
you
have
to
ask
how
low
and
for
what
reason
and
what
circumstances,
and
that
gets
very,
very
difficult.
it's
a
very
difficult
problem.
for
example,
suppose
he
is
suddenly
threatened
with
new
competition,
the
competitor
actually
comes
in
at
prices
20%
below
what
he's
charging.
does
he
violate
the
sherman
act
if
he
drops
his
price
to
meet
he
competition?
that's
not
an
easy
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
questions?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
be
happy
to
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carson
asked
what
harm
would
be
done
by
allowing
this
decree
to
continue
indefinitely
if
the
pace
that
it
is
currently
been
carried
on.
the
harm
is
in
our
view,
the
10
and
now
13
years
after
the
government
obtained
a
decree
in
this
case
which
it
hoped
would
dissipate
united's
dominance
of
this
industry.
united
by
any
reasonable
test
is
still
dominant
and
this
industry
for
a
workable
competition
has
not
been
restored
to
it,
there
has
no
prospect
that
it
will
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
if
the
present
decree
is
left
in
tact.
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
futile
exercise.
now,
the
question
then
may
arise,
are
there
other
forms
of
relief
including
divestiture
which
might
make
this
decree
more
effective?
and
we
think
there
are.
we
have
not
confined
ourselves
to
the
alternative
divestiture
alone
although
we
would
endeavor
to
show
if
we
were
given
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
that
are
feasible
ways
of
affecting
this.
there
are
other
things
that
can
be
done.
the
district
judge
in
the
original
decree
determined
although
it
was
a
rather
difficult
question
that
he
would
not
prohibit
united
from
leasing
its
machines
all
together
even
though
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
whole
system
of
leases
had
been
an
important
determinant
of
united's
ability
to
maintain
a
big
share
of
the
market.
it
gave
it
close
and
continuos
connections
with
consumers.
it
may
well
be
at
this
point
given
what
we
believe
the
obvious
failure
of
the
decree
that
that
might
--
that
option
might
now
be
taken
of
ending
leasing
all
together.
united
has
secured
new
patents
in
the
interim,
some
of
these
maybe
quite
important.
we
could
ask
for
again
compulsory
licensing
of
those
patents.
united
has
a
british
subsidiary
which
is
an
important
manufacture
shoe
machinery.
if
that
were
divested,
it
might
well
become
an
additional
competitive
factor
in
this
market.
now
of
course
i
cannot
assure
this
court
that
anyone
of
those
forms
of
relief
would
absolutely
be
feasible
and
appropriate.
i
can
assure
this
court
however
that
the
government
has
good
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
one
of
them
would
and
we
are
requesting
a
hearing
in
order
to
have
that
opportunity
--
we
think
this
market
is
by
any
reasonable
test
market
where
united
has
62%,
the
nearest
competitor
has
9%
but
that
is
not
a
workably
competitive
market
and
that
therefore
the
district
judge
oath
to
be
asked
to
consider
further
forms
of
relief.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
mr.
carson
said,
we
had
full
opportunity
to
present
evidence
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
now
workable
competition
in
this
market.
we
did
not
have
any
opportunity
to
present
any
evidence
upon
the
--
about
the
feasibility
of
appropriateness
of
further
forms
of
relief.
the
judge
by
his
pretrial
order
said,
he
would
take
no
evidence
on
that
issue
until
he
had
determined
whether
it
was
indeed
appropriate
for
the
government
to
get
any
additional
relief
at
all.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
because
our
petition
for
modification
was
dismissed.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
well,
you
see
in
our
view
and
the
district
judges
view
of
what
the
object
of
this
decree
was
of
course
different.
we
view
the
object
of
the
decree
and
he
had
so
described
it
in
his
original
opinion
as
being
the
eradication
of
united's
monopoly
power
and
the
restoration
of
workable
competition.
he
on
this
preceding,
viewed
the
object
of
the
decree
as
simply
gradually
eroding
to
use
his
words
united's
monopoly
power
and
he
determined
that
on
basis
of
that
description
of
the
object
of
the
decree
that
it
was
indeed
working
as
it
had
been
contemplated.
now,
we
of
course
insist
that
one
--
that
was
not
the
apparent
object
of
the
original
decree
and
indeed
if
it
had
been
the
explicit
object
of
the
decree,
there
would
not
had
been
a
satisfactory
decree
for
a
monopolization
case.
now,
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
given
what
the
proper
purpose
of
that
decree
was
on
this
record
and
on
the
judges
findings,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
that
object
has
not
been
achieved
and
therefore,
we
are
requesting
the
court
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
judge
with
directions
to
hold
a
hearing
as
to
what
forms
of
additional
release
might
be
feasible
and
appropriate.
now,
at
the
least
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no.
we
clearly
could
not
have
contemplated
an
immediate
dissipation
of
united's
monopoly
power
with
the
decree
that
had
in
it
what
everybody
described
is
rather
mild
remedies.
but
it
is
our
feeling
that
ten
years
is
long
enough
and
if
the
end
of
ten
years
you're
still
in
a
position
that
we're
now
in
and
there
is
the
possibility
of
many
more
years
of
this
unsatisfactory
situation
that
whatever
the
district
court
might
have
thought
the
purpose
of
the
decree
was,
the
proper
object
of
a
decree
on
monopolization
case
is
not
been
obtained.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
to
dissipate
on
that
--
effectively
dissipate
monopoly
power.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
would
urge
mr.
justice
black
that
any
company
with
62%
of
the
market
with
competitors
no
one
of
which
is
larger
than
9%
can
fairly
and
accurately
be
described
as
a
dominant
company
almost
certainly
having
exclusionary
power
and
at
least
some
lines
in
this
market
and
the
judge
himself
said
that
united's
share
in
major
machinery
lines
is
far
higher
than
it
was
in
minor
machines
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
workable
competition
is
plain
enough
in
a
store.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
of
course
not.
our
goal
--
our
goal
is
to
endeavor
by
such
further
relief
as
we
could
establish
what's
feasible
and
appropriate
to
create
at
least
one
additional
substantial
competitor
if
not
immediately
and
this
would
hinge
on
whether
we
could
get
divestiture
or
not
if
not
immediately
but
sometime
within
a
reasonable
future.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
they
have
competitors,
a
very
large
number
of
competitors.
the
biggest
one
of
which
has
revenue
--
had
revenues
in
1963
of
$3.9
million
as
compared
to
united's
i
believe
25.
in
other
words
that
largest
competitor
they
have
has
only
9%
of
the
market
and
produces
only
five
machine
lines
as
against
approximately
140
by
united.
and
we
--
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
market
in
which
you
can
have
any
confidence
at
all
that
there
is
effective
competition
and
indeed
it
indicates
quite
to
the
contrary
that
there
is
in
this
field
no
company
capable
of
offering
substantial
across
the
board
shown
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
that
was
--
i'm
afraid
i
did
leave
this
a
little
unfair
and
i
intended
to
come
back
to
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
take
the
position
that
62%
of
the
market
is
at
least
prima
facie
monopoly
power
and
if
its
creation
or
maintenance
was
equivocal
in
any
right
to
factors
other
than
skill,
foresight
and
industry
and
the
like
and
we
would
file
a
section
2
monopoly
case.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
you
may
say,
well
62%
is
borderline
and
if
we
brought
a
case
like
that
--
heavily
litigated
issues
but
we
would
consider
this
to
be
inadequate
showing
of
monopoly
power
which
if
acquired
in
ways
that
i
describe
would
violate
section
2.
now,
here
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh,
yes.
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
they
now
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
is
--
was
acquired
maintained
by
a
lot
of
practices
and
is
at
least
in
part
what
they
now
have
is
equivocal
to
that
and
that
is
why
even
though
we
could
not
now
bring
a
monopolization
case,
even
though
we
now
assume
they
have
an
interim
committed
no
unlawful
practices
that
the
original
function
of
the
decree
has
not
been
achieved
and
surely,
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
correct
the
situation
like
that.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
will
--
i
think
that
i
will
make
a
safe
answer,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
we
have
of
course
argued
that
he
did
not
construe
his
original
decree
accurately.
we
have
also
taken
the
position
however
that
even
if
he
now
--
even
the
interpretation
he
now
puts
on
it,
you
would
deem
to
be
not
unreasonable
that
still
whether
there
are
any
such
paragraph
18
in
the
decree
or
not,
it
ought
to
be
opened
to
the
government
in
appropriate
circumstances
and
we
think
this
is
clearly
one
to
a
petition
for
a
modification
and
strengthening
of
a
decree
that
has
failed
in
one
of
its
major
agenda.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
actually,
the
hardest
case
you
could
put
to
me
is
suppose
that
what
he
currently
interprets
his
decree
as
a
meaning
was
perfectly
obvious
to
everybody
concerned
at
the
time
and
then
it
may
well
--
the
government
would
certainly
be
open
to
criticism
if
nothing
else
for
not
having
appeal
on
the
ground
that
that
was
not
a
decree
that
would
go
far
enough.
and
i
think
it's
the
worst
posture
i
could
put
it
in.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
whether
it
would
or
not
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
depends
on
how
important
you
place
the
public
interest
in
an
effective
antitrust
decree
as
compared
to
some
kinds
of
considerations
that
you
ordinarily
take
into
account
--
among
private
parties.
i
mean
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
what
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i
have
described
that
as
being
a
burden
to
show
and
evident
and
substantial
failure
of
the
decree.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now
you
see,
again,
his
findings
must
be
taken
in
the
light
of
the
test
of
the
question
that
he
raised.
he
did
not
raised
the
question,
has
this
decree
succeeded
in
restoring
workable
competition
to
this
market.
the
question
he
raised
was
interpreting
paragraph
18
the
way
that
he
did,
has
it
worked
in
the
direction
of
restoring
workable
competition.
is
it
gradually
eroding
united's
power?
now
having
taken
that
as
a
standard,
i
think
really
what
you
get
here
are
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
obviously
so,
except
i
can
only
suggest
you
that
i
would
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
only
suggest
the
possibility
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
that's
necessary,
no.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
paragraph
that
you
referred
to
in
appendix
82
when
he
says,
what
the
government
is
complaining
off
is
not
that
the
decree
did
not
worked
as
expected.
you
see,
that
binds
up
within
it,
one
of
the
conflicts
we
have
with
the
judge.
in
our
view,
in
our
conception
of
what
the
decree
was,
it
clearly
did
not
work
as
it
was
expected
or
at
least
hoped
because
we
did
not
interpret
the
decree
and
i
think
our
brief
in
the
supreme
court
when
it
was
up
on
appeal
makes
this
clear.
we
did
not
interpret
the
decree
in
the
way
that
judge
wyzanski
now
does.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
least,
we
have
every
reason
in
light
of
paragraphs
18
and
23
of
that
original
decree
to
assume
that
if
the
decree
had
substantially
fail
to
eradicate
monopoly
power
we
would
be
able
to
get
some
further
relief.
at
the
very
least,
there
has
been
no
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
or
no
failure
to
take
an
appeal
that
should
have
taken
as
i
indicated
earlier.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
does
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
would
state
references
a
little
bit.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
your
honor,
i'm
very
sorry
if
i
confused
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
are
indeed
saying
that
whether
the
decree
was
well
conceived
in
its
inception
or
not
a
material
failure
in
the
decree
makes
it
appropriate
to
at
least
look
at
other
relief
--
that
we
are
saying.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
he
can
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
to
the
district
of
massachusetts
in
denying
the
government's
petition
to
modify
the
antitrust
decree
which
is
entered
in
1953
after
an
adjudication
that
the
united
shoe
machinery
corporation
had
unlawfully
monopolized
the
manufacture
of
shoe
machinery
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
in
the
earlier
proceeding,
the
court
found
that
united
was
supplying
over
75%
and
probably
around
85%
of
the
current
demand
in
the
american
shoe
machinery
market,
that
this
constituted
monopoly
power
and
that
the
position
of
such
power
violated
section
2
because
it
was
not
attributable
solely
to
defendant's
ability,
economies
of
scale,
research
or
natural
advantages.
the
court
found
that
united's
monopoly
power
was
also
attributable
in
short
to
practices
which
though
not
necessarily
unlawful
in
and
of
themselves
were
exclusionary
of
actual
and
potential
competition.
most
prominent
of
these
practices
was
united's
leasing
system
whereby
it
refused
to
sell
many
of
its
machines
and
required
long-term
leases
which
obligate
or
pressured
lessees
to
use
united's
machinery
regularly
and
over
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
in
fashioning
its
remedies,
the
district
court
described
the
purpose
of
an
antitrust
decree
in
an
unlawful
monopolization
case
as
follows,
and
i
quote,
“where
a
defendant
has
monopolized
commerce
in
violation
of
section
2,
the
principal
objects
of
the
decrees
are
to
extirpate
practices
where
that
have
caused
or
may
hereafter
cause
monopolization
and
to
restore
workable
competition
in
the
market.”
the
court
rejected
the
request
by
the
government
that
united
be
divided
into
three
equal
sized
shoe
machinery
manufacturing
firms.
united
conducted
all
manufacturing
in
--
of
shoe
machines
in
one
plant
in
beverly,
massachusetts,
the
court
concluded
that
the
government
had
not
shown
that
the
kind
of
divestiture
it
sought
was
realistic
or
feasible
in
such
circumstances.
the
court
also
declined
to
order
a
prohibition
of
all
leasing
by
united
which
hence
finally
the
government
itself
had
not
requested.
the
court
found
that
in
the
circumstances,
particularly
the
likelihood
that
many,
if
not,
most
shoe
manufacturers
could
not
afford
purchase,
such
a
restriction
would
be
undesirable,
at
least
until
milder
remedies
had
been
tried.
instead,
the
court
imposed
a
variety
of
conditions
and
restrictions
upon
--
upon
united's
activities
designed,
and
i
quote,
“to
recreate
and
independent
market.”
these
included
an
injunction
against
monopolizing
and
requirement
that
united
offer
for
sale
at
comparable
terms
all
the
machines
that
it
leases,
that
certain
restrictive
clauses
be
eliminated
from
the
leases
and
they
run
for
no
more
than
five
years,
that
the
united
dispose
of
facilities
for
the
manufacture
of
various
sundry
items,
that
it
charged
separately
for
servicing,
that
it
issues
a
reasonable
royalty
licenses
to
any
applicant
or
on
all
patents
held
by
it,
and
a
few
other
clauses
which
i
shall
not
mention.
now,
the
decree
contained
the
usual
retention
of
jurisdiction
clause
providing
that
jurisdiction
be
retained,
and
i
quote,
“for
the
purpose
of
enabling
either
of
the
parties
to
apply
to
this
court
at
any
time
for
such
further
orders
and
directions
as
may
be
appropriate,
or
the
correction,
construction
or
carrying
out
of
this
decree,
and
to
set
aside
the
decree
and
take
further
proceedings,
if
future
developments
justified
that
course
in
the
appropriate
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
act.
that
was
paragraph
23
of
the
decree.
in
addition
however,
paragraph
18
of
the
decree
provided
that
ten
years
after
its
entry,
and
again
i
quote,
“both
parties
shall
report
to
this
court
the
effect
of
this
decree
and
may
then
petition
for
its
modification
in
view
of
its
effect
in
establishing
workable
competition.
if
either
party
takes
advantage
of
this
paragraph
by
filing
a
petition,
each
such
petition
shall
be
accompanied
by
affidavit
setting
forth
the
then
structure
of
the
shoe
machinery
market
and
defendant's
power
within
that
market.”
united
appealed
this
decree
attacking
both
the
findings
and
the
decree
itself.
the
government
did
not
appeal
and
after
oral
argument,
this
court
affirmed
for
corium
simply
stating
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
justified
by
the
evidence
and
support
of
the
decree.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
now,
on
january
1,
1965
acting
under
paragraph
18
of
the
decree,
which
i've
just
quoted,
united
states
reported
to
the
district
court
that
in
its
view,
united
retained
a
dominant
share
of
the
market
and
that
workable
competition
had
not
been
established
in
the
shoe
machinery
industry
and
accordingly
petitioned
for
additional
relief.
united
cross-petitioned
to
be
relieved
from
certain
provisions
of
the
decree.
in
our
position
--
in
our
petition,
we
ask
that
united
be
required
to
submit
a
plan
under
which
it
would
establish
an
independent
full
line
shoe
machinery
manufacturing
company
capable
of
competing
with
the
defendant
in
the
shoe
machinery
market,
to
hold
hearings,
to
assure
that
such
a
plan
was
feasible
and
equitable,
would
not
result
in
a
forfeiture
to
defend
stockholders,
and
promised
a
fair
chance
of
said
company
being
able
to
compete
with
defendant,
and
to
grant
such
other
and
further
relief
as
might
be
necessary
to
establish
workable
competition
in
the
market.
united
on
the
other
hand
asked
for
a
determination
that
workable
competition
of
the
shoe
machinery
and
shoe
machinery
had
now
been
established
and
that
the
decree
accordingly
be
revised
to
retain
only
those
provisions
requiring
united
to
sell
on
comparable
terms,
as
well
as
leases
machines
to
charge
separately
for
installation
and
servicing
and
to
avoid
in
its
leases
certain
of
the
restrictive
clauses
that
the
court
had
earlier
enjoyed.
after
hearing
the
district
court
on
april
11,
1967
denied
both
petitions,
at
the
outset
of
its
opinion,
the
court
citing
united
states
versus
swift
&
company
286
us
106
stated
that
its
original
decree
could
not
be
changed
unless
the
government
made
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
invoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
the
court
found
that
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
contemplated
nothing
beyond
that
standard
and
conferred
no
broader
authority
on
the
power
of
the
court
to
honor
its
decree.
when
read
in
light
of
its
original
opinion,
the
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“the
object
of
the
decree
was
during
a
ten-year
period
not
to
restore
so-called
workable
competition
but
to
move
toward
establishing
it.”
thus,
the
court
said
it
was
simply
inviting
information
as
to
how
successful
the
decree
had
been
in
gradually
eroding,
and
that's
the
court's
phrase,
united's
1953
power
to
monopolize
the
market.
the
court
made
16
findings
of
fact
from
which
it
concluded
that
the
decree
was
working
as
had
been
originally
contemplated
in
the
way
i
just
described.
it
found
that
united
now
received
62%
of
total
machinery
revenues
as
against
probably
85%
prior
to
the
decree.
it
considered
this
change
satisfactory.
in
light
of
such
further
findings
as
to
the
growth
of
united's
competitors,
the
condition
of
the
secondhand
market,
new
competitive
processes
and
the
entry
of
new
narrow
line
companies.
the
court
found
that
united
had
no
exclusionary
power
over
the
minor
machines
and
that
if
the
shoe
machinery
industry
were
divided
into
seven
submarkets
corresponding
to
the
seven
stages
of
shoe
manufacturing,
it
was
not
clear
that
united
had
a
dominant
position
in
the
industry.
even
if
united
did,
the
court
found
this
was
not
due
to
restraints
of
trade
but
to
united's
large
funds,
white
context,
superior
products,
skill
and
merchandising,
efficiency,
conventions
and
know-how.
the
court
also
stated
that
all
what
it
described
as
artificial
barriers
to
entry
had
been
terminated
and
it
said
that
if
competition
was
not
flourishing
in
some
sectors
of
the
market,
it
was
because
no
competitor
with
large
financial
resources
had
entered
yet.
this
was
found
to
be
so
because
the
rate
of
return
on
shoe
machinery
is
unattractive
as
compared
with
other
machinery
markets.
and
so,
the
court
concluded
that
the
decree
was
still
working
in
its
long
range
task
of
freeing
the
market
from
united's
monopolization
and
keeping
the
door
open
for
an
adequately
provided
challenger.
accordingly,
it
rejected
united's
position
as
well
as
the
government's
stating
that
until
there
are
competitors
throughout
the
market,
the
decree
should
stand
unmodified.
now,
since
the
court
by
pretrial
order
had
decided
to
allow
evidence
on
relief,
only
if
it
decided
that
some
modification
of
the
decree
was
necessary,
no
evidence
on
the
appropriateness
or
feasibility
of
further
relief
was
introduced.
now,
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
government's
position
very
briefly
as
follows.
because
the
decree
after
ten
years
has
merely
eroded
some
of
united's
market
power
and
has
left
most
of
it
intact,
the
government
was
entitled
at
the
least
to
a
hearing
on
the
feasibility
and
effectiveness
of
further
relief.
the
court's
refusal
to
make
that
hearing
available
was
based
in
our
opinion
upon
an
erroneous
conception
of
the
government's
right
to
seek
modifications
of
the
decree,
particularly,
although
we
do
not
necessarily
rely
on
this
in
light
of
paragraph
18.
now,
as
the
court
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
we
are
not
there
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
i
think
i
--
i
would
like
to
be
very
careful
on
answering
that
question.
we
are
not
claiming
that
there
is
unlawful
monopolization
in
the
legal
sense.
we
are
not
conceded
that
the
power
that
united
still
retains
in
the
market
is
not
monopoly
pa
--
is
not
monopoly
power.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
for
all
that
we
know,
united
has
not
violated
the
antitrust
law
since
the
entry
of
the
decree,
so
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
62%
would
not
warrant
a
new
antitrust
--
a
new
sherman
act
case,
that
is
correct.
now,
we're
not
--
if
i
may
continue
a
little
on
this
--
we
are
not
here
disputing
the
proposition
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
to
enter
the
decree
that
it
did
at
the
time
that
it
did,
even
though
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
on
that
appeal,
the
decree
was
notable
for
its
moderation.
but
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
the
decree
has
failed
to
accomplish
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
the
basic
purpose
adverted
to
by
the
district
court
in
1953
of
eradicating
united's
monopoly
power
and
restoring
effective
competition
to
the
shoe
machinery
market.
now,
we
of
course
agree
that
the
decree
in
the
passage
of
time
have
had
a
non-insignificant
event.
united's
market
share
in
the
aggregate
has
been
reduced
from
what
was
estimated
in
1953
to
be
over
75,
probably
85%
of
the
market
to
down
around
62%,
taking
the
measure
which
the
district
judge
found
and
we
think
correctly
most
appropriate,
that
is
united
share
of
shoe
machinery
revenues.
there
have
indeed
been
a
substantial
number
of
new
entrances
into
the
business
by
small,
single
and
limited
line
companies.
and
generally
speaking,
alternatives
available
to
shoe
manufacturers
have
been
widened
by
among
other
things
that
develop
on
a
new
competitive
process.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
like
paragraph
18
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
mr.
justice?
there
have
been
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
we
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
say,
mr.
justice,
that
my
experience
is
way
too
limited
to
answer
that
question.
we
do
know
of
one
provision
comparable
to
this
which
appeared
in
a
consent
decree
which
was
substituted
for
a
litigated
decree
in
the
old
international
harvester
case.
there
may
have
been
others.
i
simply
do
not
know.
we
have
as
you
suggest,
though
within
recent
years,
included
--
well,
actually
some
much
more
specific
kinds
of
reopening
clauses
in
consent
decrees.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
consent
decrees,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
would
and
i
would
say
that
the
entitlement
of
the
government
to
endeavor
to
remedy
a
defective
decree
is
clearly
superior
when
it
comes
after
litigation
and
adjudication
of
liability.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
i
would
like
--
but
let
me
complete
my
answer,
let
me
say
this,
that
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
in
a
consent
decree
there
has
been
no
litigation
or
determination
of
liability,
it
would
be
somewhat
unfair
to
permit
the
government
to
come
in
and
substantially
augment
that
decree
again
without
having
had
to
establish
liability
which
indeed
as
you
know
most
consent
decrees
specifically
negate.
and
so,
there's
no
finding
as
to
liability.
i
would
add
to
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
a
somewhat
different
point
that
if
the
government
elected
some
ten
years
after
having
entered
into
a
consent
decree
which
is
proved
entirely
inadequate
either
to
come
in
and
be
prepared
to
litigate
liability
in
that
case
or
to
file
completely
a
new
case
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
do
so,
that
there
would
certainly
be
no
legal
bar.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
any
substantial
amendment.
i
have
--
you
know,
there
have
been
some
--
as
you
know,
some
cases
like
the
automobile
financing
case
that's
chrysler
and
ford
where
the
amendment
requested
with
at
least
in
one
case
deemed
modest
enough,
enough
within
what
would
have
the
parties
seem
to
have
as
a
purpose
of
the
decree
to
get
a
minor
modification.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it's
substantial
to
say
to
add
a
divestiture
provision
on
top
of
a
consent
decree,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
with
regard
to
what
the
decree
has
done
in
here,
we
feel
it
measured
against
the
standard
of
eradicating
monopoly
power
or
restoring
workable
competition
despite
what
the
decree
has
done,
which
i
briefly
summarized.
its
effect
can
only
be
described
as
modest
and
largely
unsuccessful.
united
remains
by
all
odds
the
dominant
firm
in
the
industry
as
the
district
court's
findings
and
the
record
plainly
show.
it
has
62%
of
the
market
taken
as
a
whole
and
its
share
of
so-called
major
machines
were
--
was
described
by
the
district
court
as
far
higher
than
its
share
of
minor
machines,
so
that
we
can
assume
the
percentages
run
higher
there.
the
shares
of
its
nearest
competitors
are
approximately
9%
and
7%
respectively.
together,
those
two
competitors
in
other
words
account
for
barely
more
than
one
quarter
of
the
market
share
of
united.
united
offers
115
types
of
machines
on
current
terms
plus
24
on
application;
its
two
leading
competitors
offer
only
22
and
5
respectively.
now,
i
think
we
should
also
note
that
it
has
taken
10
years
to
achieve
the
rather
modest
success
the
decree
has
had.
and
there's
no
guarantee
that
its
success
to
date
will
be
continued
in
the
future.
the
past
trends
could
well
be
reversed
given
united's
still
disproportionate
size
and
broad
machine
coverage
as
compared
to
that
of
any
of
its
competitors
and
given
the
fact
that
if
the
district
court's
judgment
is
upheld,
united
will
be
finally
relieved
of
any
significant
threat
of
more
effective
relief
in
the
future.
but
i
would
note
that
even
if
we
assume
that
united's
market
share
would
continue
to
decline
that
approximately
the
same
rate
as
in
the
past,
it
would
still
hold
over
40%
of
the
market
and
then
after
20
years
from
the
date
of
the
decree
with
little
reason
for
great
confidence
that
by
that
time,
any
of
its
competitors
would
have
grown
to
the
point
of
offering
a
serious
across
the
board
challenge.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
all
you
have,
mr.
justice,
is
a
contention
on
our
part
that
the
judge
should
proceed
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
what
additional
forms
of
relief
there
might
be
that
would
be
feasible
and
appropriate
and
not
more
destructive
than
they
would
be
beneficial
that
that's
our
position.
now,
we
would
--
with
regard
to
what
the
decree
has
done,
i
think
this
question
might
fairly
be
raised
that
if
it
had
been
predictable
at
the
time
the
decree
was
entered
that
in
ten
years,
united
would
still
occupy
the
dominant
position
that
it
has,
could
it
have
been
persuasively
contended
at
that
time
if
you
could
have
predicted
that
that
the
decree
provided
for
adequate
relief,
and
we
think
clearly
it
could
not.
now,
we
then
come
to
the
question,
did
the
district
court
apply
an
appropriate
standard
in
concluding
that
no
modification
of
the
decree
need
even
be
considered,
and
we
urge
that
the
court
was
clearly
wrong.
as
i
have
noted,
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
formula
of
the
swift
case
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
well
and
required
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions
before
modification
could
be
decreed.
the
court
further
held
that
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
be
interpreted
to
give
it
more
general
authority.
and
finally
as
you
know,
it
interpreted
the
decree
as
merely
an
inviting
an
inquiry
not
whether
after
ten
years
workable
competition
been
restored
but
whether
it
had
achieved
the
object
of
moving
toward
establishing
workable
competition.
now,
for
the
reasons
stated
in
detail
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
court
misconstrued
paragraph
18
of
its
decree
and
that
it's
1953
opinion
rather
than
supporting
its
present
construction
cuts
the
other
way.
that
was
certainly
the
premise
on
which
the
government
defended
the
decree
on
appeal
in
1953
where
we
set
up
the
decree,
and
i
quote,
“if
proceeded
on
the
premise
that
relatively
mild
remedies
should
be
tried
as
a
first
resort
and
that
the
possibility
of
more
drastic
measures
should
be
held
in
advance.”
and
we
immediately
thereafter
cited
paragraphs
18
and
23
of
the
decree.
and
i
would
like
to
add
that
if
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
paragraph
18
came
as
a
surprise
to
us,
which
it
did,
it
appears
also
to
have
come
to
--
as
a
surprise
to
the
defendant.
neither
its
petition
for
modification
nor
its
briefs
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
carry
any
suggestion
that
paragraph
18
merely
contemplated
and
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
decree
was
successful
in
gradually
eroding
united's
monopoly
power.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
with
regard
to
this
provision,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
it
made
any
specific
attack.
united
attacked
the
finding
of
liability
and
of
course
on
the
basis
of
that
claim,
there
should
be
no
relief
whatsoever.
as
i
said,
i
don't
recall
that
there
as
any
specific
mention
of
this.
now,
even
though
we
think
the
court
misinterpreted
its
own
provision,
it's
not
an
essential
issue.
if
the
swift
formula
is
inapplicable,
inapplicable
to
an
effort
by
the
government
to
supplement
a
decree
that
has
failed
as
materially
as
this
one
has
to
eliminate
a
monopoly
power
that
was
adjudicated
to
a
violated
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and
we
of
course
urge
that
the
swift
formula
should
not
have
been
applied
to
this
kind
of
a
case.
now,
let
me
briefly
summarize
what
swift
was
all
about.
the
defendant
meat
packers
and
that
monopolization
case
had
consented
to
a
decree
enjoining
them
from
selling
meat
at
retail
and
from
manufacturing
wholesaling
or
retailing
a
wide
range
of
non-meat
commodities.
over
a
period
of
ten
years
beginning
shortly
after
the
decree
was
entered,
defendants
had
continuously
though
unsuccessfully
sought
to
have
this
decree
vacated
or
modified
by
the
courts.
and
this
court
rejected
what
was
then
the
last
attempt
in
which
defendant
sought
to
have
the
injunction
modified
to
permit
their
wholesaling
grocery
items.
now,
the
courts
opinion
identified
two
reasons
for
the
decree
hereon
from
the
government's
complaint.
defendants
had
power
to
use
their
distribution
facilities
to
wholesale
unrelated
items
with
substantially
no
increase
in
overhead.
and
of
here,
the
defendants
would
lower
prices
temporarily
to
a
point
that
would
drive
out
competition.
this
court
said
the
decree
had
been
grown
into
theory
that
size
carries
with
it
an
opportunity
for
abuse.
this
is
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
have
been
utilized
in
the
past.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
developments
in
the
food
industry
would
in
no
way
remove
what
was
described
as
that
ancient
peril.
and
the
court
then
followed
with
the
language
we're
familiar
with
that
the
change
should
be
made
on
nothing
less
than
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice,
yes,
that
even
if
paragraph
18
were
not
in
the
decree
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
come
in
under
the
general
retention
of
jurisdiction
clause
and
seek
modification
when,
if
you
agree
with
us,
a
decree
has
failed
substantially
as
this
one,
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
get
to
later
and
would
be
happy
to
get
to
now.
now,
that's
quite
right.
obviously,
there
must
be
some
limitations
on
the
government's
right
to
come
in.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
are
interest
in
finality
continuous
and
indefinite
and
perpetual
and
certainty
may
adversely
affect
business
decisions.
but
we
don't
think
really
that
there
are
serious
problems
posed
here.
we
think
two
limitations
can
take
care
of
it,
which
i
will
put
rather
simply
in
this
way.
first,
that
the
government
certainly
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
failure
of
the
decree
has
been
evident
and
substantial
to
affect
its
purposes.
and
second,
the
government
must
certainly
petition
for
modification
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
it
can't
wait
forever.
now,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
after
the
decree
was
entered.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
guess
i'll
have
to
be
a
little
more
precise.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
kind
of
right
we
claim
beyond
the
swift
standard.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
here's
what
i
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
a
decree
it
is.
now,
this
particular
decree
here,
mr.
justice,
i
think
--
you
know,
in
fact
paragraph
18
set
a
timetable
for
the
second
look,
ten
years.
now,
given
the
nature
of
the
decree,
the
kinds
of
provisions
that
it
had,
ten
years
would
be
a
rather
reasonable
period
because
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
these
provisions
would
not
have
an
immediate
effect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
little
odd
for
me
as
representing
the
government
not
to
see
such
a
suggestion
but
i
think
it
does
go
a
little
too
far.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it
--
let
me
try
to
--
it's
easier
i
think
to
indicate
a
situation
in
which
it
might
be
deemed
unreasonable
and
whether
it
would
be
reasonable.
let
us
suppose
that
a
particular
decree
was
adopted
to
eliminate
unlawful
fair
trading.
and
it
became
fairly
quickly
apparent
that
the
decree
was
not
doing
that,
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
retailers
were
still
abiding
by
the
manufacturers
apparent
which
is
the
price.
and
suppose
that
became
apparent
within
six
months
after
the
decree
but
the
government
waits
for
ten
years
to
come
in
for
a
modification.
it
seems
to
me
that's
rather
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
i
think
there's
some
obligation
on
the
company
but
certainly
if
it
follows
best
practice
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
come
in
as
soon
as
it
does
become
reasonably
apparent
that
the
decree
is
inadequate
now.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
you're
right.
that's
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i
think
your
statement
is
indeed
more
accurate.
in
other
words,
within
the
reasonable
time
after
there
appears
to
be
reason
for
moving
for
modification.
i
would
agree.
now,
just
to
finish
up
with
regard
the
swift,
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
a
case
that
is
fairly
described
as
one
in
which
the
court
was
putting
--
giving
primary
importance,
paramount
importance
to
the
protection
of
the
public
interest
in
competition.
and
to
turn
that
around
and
to
apply
the
swift
formula
where
the
government
endeavors
to
repair
a
plainly
ineffective
decree,
we
think
it
makes
no
sense.
clearly
the
paramount
public
interest
is
--
in
restoring
competition
is
not
served
by
opposing
upon
the
government
the
enormous
burden
of
making
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
in
short,
by
throwing
all
of
the
benefits
of
the
doubt
against
the
public
interest.
i
think
the
point
would
be
clear,
perfectly
clear
if
swift
were
held
as
a
district
court
rule
to
deprive
district
courts
of
even
the
authority
to
include
in
their
decree
clauses
permitting
reopening
and
further
relief
on
standards
less
severe
than
the
swift
formula
would
impose.
for
that,
we'd
then
force
the
government
and
we
think
district
courts
to
adopt
the
most
drastic
possible
relief
in
each
case
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
public
interest
in
the
restoration
of
workable
competition
would
be
achieved.
indeed,
the
imposition
of
such
hurdles
on
subsequent
strengthening
of
inadequate
decrees
would
destroy
any
basis
for
the
approach
partially
reflected
in
the
original
decree
in
this
case
that
far
reaching
remedies
should
not
be
employed
until
milder
remedies
have
been
tried.
it
would
be
impossible
in
our
position
that
the
public
--
in
terms
of
protecting
the
public
interest
to
maintain
that
doctrine
of
trying
milder
remedies
in
preference
to
harsh
remedies,
and
then
deprive
the
government
or
the
district
court
of
any
power
to
repair
the
decree
whether
this
turned
out
to
be
substantially
defective.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
this
is
about
all
i
have
to
say
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
a
somewhat
different
question.
i
think
there's
certainly
a
heavy
presumption
that
anybody
who
comply
with
a
decree
designed
to
eliminate
unlawful
conduct
or
even
questionable
conduct
is
not
violating
the
law
i
would
say.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
--
i
hesitate
only
because
it's
conceivable
that
a
decree
may
fail
to
prohibit
certain
practices,
which
if
the
defendant
started
following
and
would
make
a
new
case
on
unlawful
monopolization.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we're
not
claiming
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
think
it's
been
variously
formulated
--
i
think
one
is
sort
of,
again,
in
a
negative
way,
it
is
--
you
were
violating
section
2
if
you
have
monopoly
power
and
you
got
it
or
maintaining
it
by
any
other
--
by
any
practices
or
for
any
reasons
other
than
that.
skill
--
you
have
skill
of
foresight
in
industry,
you've
developed
--
you
obtain
lawful
patents
on
new
techniques
and
you're
just
competing
like
people
who
are
supposed
to
compete.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
if
the
price
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
price
level
at
which
he
sells
seems
to
me
irrelevant.
if
he
has
lawful
monopoly
power,
it
doesn't
become
unlawful
merely
because
he
charges
a
high
price
i
think.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
or
--
well,
a
low
price
begins
to
raise
question.
you
have
to
ask
how
low
and
for
what
reason
and
what
circumstances,
and
that
gets
very,
very
difficult.
it's
a
very
difficult
problem.
for
example,
suppose
he
is
suddenly
threatened
with
new
competition,
the
competitor
actually
comes
in
at
prices
20%
below
what
he's
charging.
does
he
violate
the
sherman
act
if
he
drops
his
price
to
meet
he
competition?
that's
not
an
easy
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
questions?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
be
happy
to
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carson
asked
what
harm
would
be
done
by
allowing
this
decree
to
continue
indefinitely
if
the
pace
that
it
is
currently
been
carried
on.
the
harm
is
in
our
view,
the
10
and
now
13
years
after
the
government
obtained
a
decree
in
this
case
which
it
hoped
would
dissipate
united's
dominance
of
this
industry.
united
by
any
reasonable
test
is
still
dominant
and
this
industry
for
a
workable
competition
has
not
been
restored
to
it,
there
has
no
prospect
that
it
will
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
if
the
present
decree
is
left
in
tact.
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
futile
exercise.
now,
the
question
then
may
arise,
are
there
other
forms
of
relief
including
divestiture
which
might
make
this
decree
more
effective?
and
we
think
there
are.
we
have
not
confined
ourselves
to
the
alternative
divestiture
alone
although
we
would
endeavor
to
show
if
we
were
given
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
that
are
feasible
ways
of
affecting
this.
there
are
other
things
that
can
be
done.
the
district
judge
in
the
original
decree
determined
although
it
was
a
rather
difficult
question
that
he
would
not
prohibit
united
from
leasing
its
machines
all
together
even
though
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
whole
system
of
leases
had
been
an
important
determinant
of
united's
ability
to
maintain
a
big
share
of
the
market.
it
gave
it
close
and
continuos
connections
with
consumers.
it
may
well
be
at
this
point
given
what
we
believe
the
obvious
failure
of
the
decree
that
that
might
--
that
option
might
now
be
taken
of
ending
leasing
all
together.
united
has
secured
new
patents
in
the
interim,
some
of
these
maybe
quite
important.
we
could
ask
for
again
compulsory
licensing
of
those
patents.
united
has
a
british
subsidiary
which
is
an
important
manufacture
shoe
machinery.
if
that
were
divested,
it
might
well
become
an
additional
competitive
factor
in
this
market.
now
of
course
i
cannot
assure
this
court
that
anyone
of
those
forms
of
relief
would
absolutely
be
feasible
and
appropriate.
i
can
assure
this
court
however
that
the
government
has
good
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
one
of
them
would
and
we
are
requesting
a
hearing
in
order
to
have
that
opportunity
--
we
think
this
market
is
by
any
reasonable
test
market
where
united
has
62%,
the
nearest
competitor
has
9%
but
that
is
not
a
workably
competitive
market
and
that
therefore
the
district
judge
oath
to
be
asked
to
consider
further
forms
of
relief.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
mr.
carson
said,
we
had
full
opportunity
to
present
evidence
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
now
workable
competition
in
this
market.
we
did
not
have
any
opportunity
to
present
any
evidence
upon
the
--
about
the
feasibility
of
appropriateness
of
further
forms
of
relief.
the
judge
by
his
pretrial
order
said,
he
would
take
no
evidence
on
that
issue
until
he
had
determined
whether
it
was
indeed
appropriate
for
the
government
to
get
any
additional
relief
at
all.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
because
our
petition
for
modification
was
dismissed.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
well,
you
see
in
our
view
and
the
district
judges
view
of
what
the
object
of
this
decree
was
of
course
different.
we
view
the
object
of
the
decree
and
he
had
so
described
it
in
his
original
opinion
as
being
the
eradication
of
united's
monopoly
power
and
the
restoration
of
workable
competition.
he
on
this
preceding,
viewed
the
object
of
the
decree
as
simply
gradually
eroding
to
use
his
words
united's
monopoly
power
and
he
determined
that
on
basis
of
that
description
of
the
object
of
the
decree
that
it
was
indeed
working
as
it
had
been
contemplated.
now,
we
of
course
insist
that
one
--
that
was
not
the
apparent
object
of
the
original
decree
and
indeed
if
it
had
been
the
explicit
object
of
the
decree,
there
would
not
had
been
a
satisfactory
decree
for
a
monopolization
case.
now,
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
given
what
the
proper
purpose
of
that
decree
was
on
this
record
and
on
the
judges
findings,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
that
object
has
not
been
achieved
and
therefore,
we
are
requesting
the
court
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
judge
with
directions
to
hold
a
hearing
as
to
what
forms
of
additional
release
might
be
feasible
and
appropriate.
now,
at
the
least
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no.
we
clearly
could
not
have
contemplated
an
immediate
dissipation
of
united's
monopoly
power
with
the
decree
that
had
in
it
what
everybody
described
is
rather
mild
remedies.
but
it
is
our
feeling
that
ten
years
is
long
enough
and
if
the
end
of
ten
years
you're
still
in
a
position
that
we're
now
in
and
there
is
the
possibility
of
many
more
years
of
this
unsatisfactory
situation
that
whatever
the
district
court
might
have
thought
the
purpose
of
the
decree
was,
the
proper
object
of
a
decree
on
monopolization
case
is
not
been
obtained.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
to
dissipate
on
that
--
effectively
dissipate
monopoly
power.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
would
urge
mr.
justice
black
that
any
company
with
62%
of
the
market
with
competitors
no
one
of
which
is
larger
than
9%
can
fairly
and
accurately
be
described
as
a
dominant
company
almost
certainly
having
exclusionary
power
and
at
least
some
lines
in
this
market
and
the
judge
himself
said
that
united's
share
in
major
machinery
lines
is
far
higher
than
it
was
in
minor
machines
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
workable
competition
is
plain
enough
in
a
store.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
of
course
not.
our
goal
--
our
goal
is
to
endeavor
by
such
further
relief
as
we
could
establish
what's
feasible
and
appropriate
to
create
at
least
one
additional
substantial
competitor
if
not
immediately
and
this
would
hinge
on
whether
we
could
get
divestiture
or
not
if
not
immediately
but
sometime
within
a
reasonable
future.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
sir.
they
have
competitors,
a
very
large
number
of
competitors.
the
biggest
one
of
which
has
revenue
--
had
revenues
in
1963
of
$3.9
million
as
compared
to
united's
i
believe
25.
in
other
words
that
largest
competitor
they
have
has
only
9%
of
the
market
and
produces
only
five
machine
lines
as
against
approximately
140
by
united.
and
we
--
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
market
in
which
you
can
have
any
confidence
at
all
that
there
is
effective
competition
and
indeed
it
indicates
quite
to
the
contrary
that
there
is
in
this
field
no
company
capable
of
offering
substantial
across
the
board
shown
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
that
was
--
i'm
afraid
i
did
leave
this
a
little
unfair
and
i
intended
to
come
back
to
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
take
the
position
that
62%
of
the
market
is
at
least
prima
facie
monopoly
power
and
if
its
creation
or
maintenance
was
equivocal
in
any
right
to
factors
other
than
skill,
foresight
and
industry
and
the
like
and
we
would
file
a
section
2
monopoly
case.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
you
may
say,
well
62%
is
borderline
and
if
we
brought
a
case
like
that
--
heavily
litigated
issues
but
we
would
consider
this
to
be
inadequate
showing
of
monopoly
power
which
if
acquired
in
ways
that
i
describe
would
violate
section
2.
now,
here
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh,
yes.
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
they
now
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
is
--
was
acquired
maintained
by
a
lot
of
practices
and
is
at
least
in
part
what
they
now
have
is
equivocal
to
that
and
that
is
why
even
though
we
could
not
now
bring
a
monopolization
case,
even
though
we
now
assume
they
have
an
interim
committed
no
unlawful
practices
that
the
original
function
of
the
decree
has
not
been
achieved
and
surely,
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
correct
the
situation
like
that.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
will
--
i
think
that
i
will
make
a
safe
answer,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
we
have
of
course
argued
that
he
did
not
construe
his
original
decree
accurately.
we
have
also
taken
the
position
however
that
even
if
he
now
--
even
the
interpretation
he
now
puts
on
it,
you
would
deem
to
be
not
unreasonable
that
still
whether
there
are
any
such
paragraph
18
in
the
decree
or
not,
it
ought
to
be
opened
to
the
government
in
appropriate
circumstances
and
we
think
this
is
clearly
one
to
a
petition
for
a
modification
and
strengthening
of
a
decree
that
has
failed
in
one
of
its
major
agenda.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
actually,
the
hardest
case
you
could
put
to
me
is
suppose
that
what
he
currently
interprets
his
decree
as
a
meaning
was
perfectly
obvious
to
everybody
concerned
at
the
time
and
then
it
may
well
--
the
government
would
certainly
be
open
to
criticism
if
nothing
else
for
not
having
appeal
on
the
ground
that
that
was
not
a
decree
that
would
go
far
enough.
and
i
think
it's
the
worst
posture
i
could
put
it
in.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
whether
it
would
or
not
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
depends
on
how
important
you
place
the
public
interest
in
an
effective
antitrust
decree
as
compared
to
some
kinds
of
considerations
that
you
ordinarily
take
into
account
--
among
private
parties.
i
mean
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
what
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i
have
described
that
as
being
a
burden
to
show
and
evident
and
substantial
failure
of
the
decree.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now
you
see,
again,
his
findings
must
be
taken
in
the
light
of
the
test
of
the
question
that
he
raised.
he
did
not
raised
the
question,
has
this
decree
succeeded
in
restoring
workable
competition
to
this
market.
the
question
he
raised
was
interpreting
paragraph
18
the
way
that
he
did,
has
it
worked
in
the
direction
of
restoring
workable
competition.
is
it
gradually
eroding
united's
power?
now
having
taken
that
as
a
standard,
i
think
really
what
you
get
here
are
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
obviously
so,
except
i
can
only
suggest
you
that
i
would
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
only
suggest
the
possibility
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
that's
necessary,
no.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
paragraph
that
you
referred
to
in
appendix
82
when
he
says,
what
the
government
is
complaining
off
is
not
that
the
decree
did
not
worked
as
expected.
you
see,
that
binds
up
within
it,
one
of
the
conflicts
we
have
with
the
judge.
in
our
view,
in
our
conception
of
what
the
decree
was,
it
clearly
did
not
work
as
it
was
expected
or
at
least
hoped
because
we
did
not
interpret
the
decree
and
i
think
our
brief
in
the
supreme
court
when
it
was
up
on
appeal
makes
this
clear.
we
did
not
interpret
the
decree
in
the
way
that
judge
wyzanski
now
does.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
least,
we
have
every
reason
in
light
of
paragraphs
18
and
23
of
that
original
decree
to
assume
that
if
the
decree
had
substantially
fail
to
eradicate
monopoly
power
we
would
be
able
to
get
some
further
relief.
at
the
very
least,
there
has
been
no
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
or
no
failure
to
take
an
appeal
that
should
have
taken
as
i
indicated
earlier.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
does
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
would
state
references
a
little
bit.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
your
honor,
i'm
very
sorry
if
i
confused
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
are
indeed
saying
that
whether
the
decree
was
well
conceived
in
its
inception
or
not
a
material
failure
in
the
decree
makes
it
appropriate
to
at
least
look
at
other
relief
--
that
we
are
saying.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
he
can
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit.
