mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
united
shoe
machinery
corporation,
i
would
like
not
only
to
emphasize
that
that
defendant
has
faithfully
complied
with
the
detailed
decree
which
this
court
affirmed
in
1954.
but
then,
the
shoe
machinery
business
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
is
a
business
of
heterogeneous
and
diverse
character,
very
different
from
one
treating
a
homogeneous
product
adaptable
to
a
62%
level.
and
i
should
like
also
at
the
outset
to
take
advantage
of
the
assistant
attorney
general's
candid
--
commendably
candid
admission
that
the
government
does
not
claim
that
there
is
any
unlawful
monopolization
in
the
legal
sense,
i
quoted
his
words,
affected
by
the
defendant
after
the
operative
date
of
the
decree.
in
fact,
mr.
turner
went
further
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
there's
no
indication
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
would
remain
to
be
determined
on
new
issues
and
new
showings
of
fact,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
if
you
had
the
market
power
sufficient
to
exclude,
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
could
also
be
examined
into
but
none
of
that
is
in
this
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
i
think
that
i
can
demonstrate
by
the
reference
to
the
findings
as
to
the
entry
of
new
competition
and
the
profitability
of
new
competitors
that
the
price
control,
which
you
referred
to,
mr.
justice
white,
could
not
be
in
this
record.
in
fact,
i
also
embrace
the
further
frank
statement
by
mr.
turner
that
there
is
no
violation
in
the
maintenance
of
a
mix
mere
62%
of
the
market.
but
i
shall
at
once
proceed
i
think
to
try
to
convince
your
honors
that
this
62%
which
has
been
referred
to
so
much
in
the
argument
and
in
the
government
brief
is
a
mere
measure
taken
at
a
point
of
time
five
years
ago
that
there
are
other
measures
showing
a
lower
percentage
of
united's
occupancy
and
that
both
measures
are
and
have
been
moving
downward.
conspicuously
absent
from
both
the
assistant
attorney
general's
argument
and
the
government's
brief
is
the
reference
to
the
motion
in
this
market,
which
is
a
motion
downward.
but
before
i
proceed
to
that
development,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
further
embrace
if
i
may
the
statement
which
i
think
as
erroneous
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
the
government
had
no
hearing
on
relief.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
on
this
sea
day
hearing,
so-called,
as
of
january
1,
1965,
there
was
no
separate
hearing
on
relief.
but
in
the
original
case
which
occupied
121
trial
days,
both
relief
and
liability
were
considered
at
the
same
time.
in
our
brief,
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
devoted
four
paragraphs
at
page
348
of
110
federal
supplements
to
the
request
for
dissolution.
that
request
was
insistently
pressed
by
the
government
at
that
time.
and
those
four
paragraphs
begin
with
a
single
statement
which
along
i
will
need
read,
“the
government's
proposal
that
the
court
dissolve
united
into
three
separate
manufacturing
companies
is
unrealistic.”
there's
factual
development
of
that
finding.
and
in
the
government's
pretrial,
the
proceedings
on
sea
day,
there
was
no
effort
made
and
no
evidence
adduced
to
indicate
that
that
position
now
is
in
any
way
different
from
the
position
in
1953.
in
fact,
i
may
say
that
it's
identical.
the
government
lost,
as
i
say,
its
application
to
dissolve
in
1953.
the
government
did
not
appeal.
the
government
let
the
decree
go
into
operation
upon
this
court's
affirmance
after
the
defendant's
appeal,
which
was
in
effectual
in
modifying
the
decree
in
any
particular.
with
reference
i
think
to
justice
harlan's
question
whether
the
defendant's
brief
in
this
court
particularly
adverted
to
the
review
in
ten
years
by
hasty
inspection
indicates
that
it
did
not
so
advert,
that
we
contended
throughout,
that
the
finding
of
liability
was
erroneous
and
not
in
accordance
with
previous
determinations
of
this
court
and
not
in
accordance
with
the
evidence.
however
that
may
be,
i
think
the
government
has
forgotten
that
it
represented
to
this
court
in
1954
that
there
was
an
adequate
hearing
on
relief
in
the
main
trial.
and
i
take
leave,
if
i
might
mr.
chief
justice,
to
read
a
few
words
from
page
141
of
the
government's
brief
signed
by
solicitor
general
sobeloff.
during
the
case
of
the
course
of
the
trial
which
took
121
trial
days,
the
district
judge
heard
testimony
relating
to
all
phases
of
the
industry.
he
patiently
examined
and
studied
some
thousands
of
aluminous
exhibits
which
were
admitted
into
evidence.
he
had
extended
opportunity
not
only
to
observe
what
was
wrong
with
united's
practices
but
to
explore
alternative
courses
of
conduct.
he
personally
questioned
witnesses
at
a
considerable
length
considering
the
feasibility
of
various
possible
measures
for
relief.
thus,
professor
dean
--
joel
dean
was
the
defendant's
economic
expert
--
thus,
professor
dean
was
requested
by
the
court
to
study
a
series
of
questions
relating
to
relief
and
to
testify
in
relation
to
each
of
them.
he
did
so
freely
and
exhaustively.
then
there's
a
reference
to
the
record
and
i
conclude
with
a
statement
of
the
government
counsel
in
1954
to
this
court,
“the
careful
consideration
which
underlies
the
provisions
for
relief
is
further
demonstrated
by
the
logic,
the
clarity
and
the
meticulousness
of
the
opinion
on
remedy
and
of
the
decree
itself.”
this
passage
was
preceded
by
statements
that
the
hearing
on
relief
was
conducted
with
a
hearing
on
liability.
so
to
sum
up
that
portion
of
what
i
have
to
say,
i
would
say
that
the
government
is
proceeding
on
a
misconception
that
it
has
not
hearing
on
relief,
that
it
had
a
hearing
on
relief,
that
partial
--
part
of
its
request
was
denied
and
it
failed
to
appeal,
that
the
bulk
of
its
request
as
to
a
media
rating
and
corrective
factors
in
the
market
was
accepted,
and
that
the
operative
clauses
of
the
decree
which
i
shall
now
like
to
refer
to
in
somewhat
more
detail,
have
been
extremely
affected.
i
think
that
the
government
demonstrates
its
power
in
saying,
as
i
remember
the
language
of
mr.
turner,
that
the
decree
has
been
patently
ineffective.
what
did
the
decree
attempted
to
do?
your
honors,
you
have
it
before
you
in
connection
with
a
private
trouble
damage
case
which
related
to
the
effect
of
the
decree
on
the
preceding
liability
and
conduct
of
the
defendant.
now,
this
portion
of
this
case
deals
with
the
effect
of
the
decree
upon
the
market
and
the
defendant's
conduct
after
its
effective
date.
and
in
response
to
questions
from
members
of
the
court
as
to
effective
date,
i
might
remind
the
court
that
while
this
court's
affirmance
occurred
in
june
1954,
elaborate
provisions
for
dismantling
the
leases
required
some
time
and
the
decree
began
to
operate
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
as
of
june
1,
1955
retroactive
january
1,
1955
when
the
court
approved
a
very
complex
plan
for
terminating
all
the
existing
leases
at
the
option
of
the
lessees
so
that
if
you
look
at
the
beginning
of
the
experience
period,
january
1
at
earliest
1955
up
until
the
date
of
the
statistical
studying
that
was
made
in
this
case
to
measure
market
share
and
market
power.
you
have
as
a
terminal
date
for
that
study
the
fiscal
year
1963
because
while
the
court's
directive
reports
as
of
january
1,
1965,
the
course
of
time
necessary
to
collect
information
from
not
only
the
defendant
but
125
other
suppliers
in
the
field
met
--
but
the
time
the
evidence
could
be
tended
to
the
court,
the
fiscal
year
of
1963
was
the
last
effective
date.
so
you
had
eight
years,
maybe
nine
years
of
effective
operation.
now,
at
this
point,
five
years
or
four
years
from
this
last
experience
date,
you
have
the
government
telling
you
that
a
decline
from
85%
of
market
to
62%
which
is
23
points
in
eight
years
is
not
enough.
it
seems
to
me
with
all
respect
that
is
a
rather
curious
contention,
an
untenable
contention.
i
cannot
understand
the
impatience
exhibited
in
the
government's
approach
to
the
now
demanding
and
renewing
this
surgical
treatment
of
divestiture.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
didn't
understand,
mr.
justice.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
had
not
gone
down
at
all?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
think
the
court
would
have
to
conclude
the
decree
had
not
operated
as
intended.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
i
could
say,
your
honor
that
the
aim
of
the
decree
was
to
extirpate
the
practices
for
in
number
in
clause
four
of
the
decree.
it
represented
monopolization.
i
don't
think
i'm
prepared
to
admit
that
the
decree
must
also
cut
down
one
from
one
percent
to
another,
but
i
would
say
that
the
free
application
of
competitive
forces
would
have
that
effect
and
have
had
that
effect.
as
it
shown
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
i
did
not,
but
i
think
it's
a
fair
question
and
attitude
of
any
court
to
say
that
if
the
four
practices
which
were
to
be
terminated
were
really
terminated,
the
natural
entry
of
competitive
forces
would
wear
down
the
united
occupancy
in
the
market
as
they
did.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
there
is
in
active
sense
monopolization.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
must
admit
that
that
does
seem
common
sense
and
that
has
been
the
operation
of
the
fact
here
and
it
may
be
the
operation
in
logic.
but
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
extreme
measure
that
i
think
this
court
has
set
forth
in
the
united
states
against
griffith
and
in
the
grinnell
case
and
that
judge
wyzanski
adopted
in
his
decision
was
that
monopolization
being
shown,
the
monopoly
must
be
dissipated
and
rendered
or
rendered
impotent.
now,
you
could
say
that
if
85%
was
the
result
of
monopolization,
then
the
effect
of
the
decree
would
be
to
dissipate
that
and
it
has
been.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
i
could
embrace
the
other
clause
and
render
it
impotent.
now,
i
think
i'm
prepared
to
show
that
even
if
there
were
85%
that
so
much
of
the
competition
coming
in,
if
it
even
were
ineffective,
that
we
have
a
competitive
situation.
i
hesitate,
mr.
justice
white,
to
debate
this
principle
on
facts
that
are
--
not
the
facts
of
this
record
but
on
unfavorably
to
my
contention.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
monopoly
power
has
to
be
dissipated
by
the
removal
of
monopolization.
and
if
monopolization
is
removed
by
the
extirpation
of
these
four
practices
--
i'm
just
repeating
myself
--
the
natural
flow
of
competition
coming
in
will
reduce
the
apparent
market
share.
it
has
in
this
case.
now,
your
honor,
it
seemed
to
me
to
put
a
question.
supposing
it
did
not,
supposing
it
remained
85%,
if
some
position
on
favor
to
my
case
and
not
contrary
to
the
record,
well
i
suppose
in
frankness,
one
could
say
that
even
if
with
full
entry
and
opportunity
for
competitive
forces,
the
remained
85%
in
the
united
occupancy
had
meant
only
that
united
or
whatever
was
a
dominant
producer
was
competing
on
the
basis
of
superior
skill
and
efficiency.
there's
no
law
to
the
effect.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
yes.
the
government
has
been
very
stringent.
mr.
turner's
staff
had
been
extremely
diligent
and
persistent.
they'd
asked
as
many
questions
as
they
could.
i
can
assure
the
court
that
there
were
here
in
pretrial
proceedings
a
great
massive
material
which
resulted
in
the
conclusion
that
there's
been
no
monopolization
since.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
say
that
if
there
are
no
new
facts
following
your
honor's
questions
that
it
worked
as
it
was
intended,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
reopening
since
this
decree
contemplated
a
gradual
erosion.
it's
so
stated
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
says
that
it
did
not
accomplish
desired
results.
but
the
district
court
which
framed
the
decree
thought
that
it
did
accomplish
the
desired
results.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
oh!
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
it
would.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
did
not
think
so,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
his
opinion
on
page
82
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
it
says
what
the
government
is
complaining
was
not
the
decree
did
not
work
as
expected
but
that
in
working
in
this
way,
the
decree
did
not
accomplish
what
the
government
had
prayed
for.
that
is
dissolution
as
i
take
it,
your
honor.
in
short,
the
government
petitions
the
decree
be
reversed
because
this
coerced
in
1953.
i
think
he's
there
referring
to
dissolution.
now,
as
to
more
direct
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
i
wanted
to
remind
the
court
that
conjointly
with
the
statement
in
1966
by
the
district
court,
the
intention
was
a
gradual
erosion
of
the
market
power
of
united.
you
have
the
statement
in
1953
which
explains
the
theory
of
the
decree.
as
to
the
secondhand
market
on
page
--
well,
i
have
a
pamphlet
opinion
here.
as
a
secondhand
market,
united
will
face
a
type
of
substitute
competition
which
will
gradually
weaken
the
prohibited
market
power
which
had
now
exercised.
and
then
again,
as
to
a
sales
market,
the
district
court
said
in
1953,
the
creation
of
a
sales
market
together
with
a
purging
of
the
restrictive
features
of
the
leases
will,
in
combination,
gradually
diminish
the
magnetic
hold
now
exercised
by
united
and
so
on.
now,
those
passages
are
at
page
350
of
110
federal
supplement
and
there
are
other
similar
passages
indicating
that
the
judge
was
relying
on
the
inevitability
of
gradualness.
now,
since
that
has
worked,
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
adhere
to
any
position
that
a
retention
of
85%
would
still
be
defensible.
in
fact,
the
52%
that
the
district
court
found
on
a
measure
of
comparative
revenues
to
be
the
share
of
united's
revenues,
united's
occupancy
in
1963
a
contrast
with
an
85%
eight
years
or
nine
years
ago,
possibly
a
92%
of
revenues
enjoyed
by
united
at
the
time
of
the
original
violation.
i
take
the
figure
of
92%
from
the
government's
brief
in
the
district
court,
which
is
repeated
in
the
record
on
this
hearing.
but
in
any
event,
if
it
were
only
a
decline
from
85%
to
62%
in
eight
or
ten
years,
we
should
have
a
magnificent
showing
in
an
industry
which
is
a
capital
goods
industry
with
the
machines
enjoying
a
long
machine
life
and
with
a
complicated
situation
to
rectify.
let
me
refer
a
little
more
fully
to
what
decree
was
attempting
to
do
in
1953
as
it
was
then
presented
to
this
court.
the
court
pointed
out
that
while
united's
conduct
had
been
entirely
conformable
with
the
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
new
developments
in
the
decisions
effective
about
1946
had
made
the
retention
of
the
then
market
share
by
restrictive
lease
clauses
even
though
similar
to
those
previously
adjudicated
here.
it
made
the
retention
of
market
share
by
those
lease
clauses
now
illegal
and
monopolization.
the
court
directed
that
a
plan
be
submitted,
which
as
done,
to
terminate
at
the
option
of
the
lessees
all
the
outstanding
leases
about
a
hundred
thousand
in
number.
that
plan
took
effect
as
of
june
1,
1955
as
i've
said.
and
over
a
period
of
time
beginning
in
1955,
all
the
--
all
leases
were
terminated
and
potentially
a
large
bulk
of
the
machines
then
held
by
the
lessees
--
purchased
by
the
lessees
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
which
provided
for
the
calculation
of
a
purchase
price,
including
the
cost
of
capital
of
the
shoe
machinery
--
of
the
shoe
manufacturers
as
part
of
the
elements
of
that
purchase
price.
so
that
the
leasing
system
as
it
then
existed
was
cut
out
and
regardless
of
whether
the
option
to
terminate
was
exercised
by
the
lessees
as
of
55,
56,
57
and
so
on,
the
court
directed
that
forthwith
these
restrictive
practices
stop
and
they
were
stopped.
the
court
also
provided
that
where
leasing
continued,
there
should
be
in
the
future
an
opportunity
for
purchase
at
a
price,
which
was
not
a
disadvantageous
or
not
especially
advantageous
to
leasing.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
your
honor,
i
do
realize
that
the
government
said
the
proper
standard
was
not
applied.
and
in
addressing
myself
to
that,
i
repeat
that
the
standard
adopted
in
the
framing
of
the
decree
was
the
elimination
of
market
control
in
a
gradual
measure
and
that
the
judge
has
found
after
the
full
review
that
that
gradual
elimination
is
an
accomplished
and
is
being
accomplished
and
will
continue.
the
findings
as
to
the
gradual
erosion
of
market
power,
the
findings
as
to
the
diminution
which
the
decree
envisaged
are
not
challenged
here.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
appreciate
the
question.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
on
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
i
would
think
that
if
they
show
that
monopoly
remains
even
though
a,
b
and
c
have
been
fulfilled,
then
the
result
is
the
decree
has
not
operated
as
contemplated.
now,
it's
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yeah,
it
would
entitle
them
to
relief.
now,
that
is
radically
different
than
on
the
position
here.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
manner
of
the
erosion
that
was
intended
and
so
stated
by
judge
wyzanski
in
his
findings.
but
it's
having
the
effect
of
substantially
reducing
market
share
and
market
power
of
the
united
as
originally
held
by
it
in
1953.
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
as
tables
a,
b
and
c,
a
tabulation
made
from
the
census
or
rather
from
united's
own
machinery
shipment
records
to
show
the
massive
changes
in
the
machine
inventory
and
the
going
out
of
the
old
machines
and
the
reduction
of
control
of
machines
by
united.
table
a
taken
from
united's
records
shows
the
18
major
types
on
which
most
emphasis
was
placed
because
they're
the
more
important
machines
and
as
judge
said,
the
12
minor
types
showed
much
less
market
control
by
united.
the
18
major
types
showing
the
number
that
are
on
lease
in
1955,
54,000,
the
number
shipped
since
1955,
10,000,
the
number
returned
showing
a
net
of
returns
of
16,000
machines
of
those
pre-55
types.
table
b
separates
out
the
types
or
models
adopted
since
1955
and
shows
on
the
same
basis
the
number
shipped,
the
number
returned,
and
in
both
tables,
the
number
sold.
now,
the
number
sold
both
on
what
are
called
conversion
or
transforming
leases
into
sales
or
new
sales
as
directed
by
the
decree
are
extremely
important
because
they
tend
to
create
the
secondhand
market.
and
the
position
eight
years
after
the
decree
is
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
machinery
that
were
the
instrument
of
the
monopolization
found
is
in
the
hands
of
customers
or
in
the
hands
of
the
secondhand
dealers.
we
have
in
the
record
the
statements
of
two
secondhand
dealers
and
we
have
in
the
findings
the
bulk
of
dollar
sales
of
those
dealers
showing
they
are
substantial
in
road
into
the
market,
so
united's
former
means
of
monopolization
are
now
a
means
of
competition
with
it.
now,
in
table
c,
we
have
put
together
on
the
same
18
categories
a
combination
of
the
pre-55
and
the
post-55
models,
so
that
you
can
see
in
combined
the
total
that
have
been
disposed
of
and
how
they
have
been
disposed
of.
on
another
table
overleaf
on
page
52
of
our
brief
called
table
d,
we
have
a
say
to
give
the
court
in
terms
of
dollars
a
picture
of
the
movement
overtime.
the
movement
overtime
of
not
only
united's
income
from
leases
and
sales
but
the
income
of
the
principal
competitors
whose
witnesses
we
can
get
on
the
stand.
there
were
received
an
evidence
affidavits
of
scores
of
suppliers
but
those
affidavits
did
not
contain
a
picture
of
revenue
year
by
year.
so
as
--
so
that
to
show
the
progress
of
the
erosion
that
judge
wyzanski
directed,
we
endeavored
to
get
from
the
records
of
those
competitors
we
could
get
on
the
stand
the
dollar
receipts
year
by
year
to
compare
in
their
total
with
united's
receipts.
and
in
table
d,
you
will
see
that
united's
receipts
went
down
in
the
aggregate
from
$32
million
to
$24
million,
even
though
the
latter
figure
probably
gives
some
effect
to
inflation.
and
you
will
see
that
these
12
competitors
who
were
the
only
ones
with
whom
we
could
get
figures
had
gone
up
in
the
aggregate
from
$3.5
million
to
$8
and
--
$8.10
million.
now,
of
course
there's
a
great
deal
of
variety
among
these.
some
of
them
go
up
and
down,
but
you
will
notice
that
a
number
like
cic,
an
english
company,
only
entered
the
market
in
1959,
you
will
notice
that
industrial
shoe
began
to
--
number
three,
began
to
create
a
substantial
volume
in
1959.
and
you
will
notice
that
international
shoe,
one
of
our
principal
competitors
almost
quadrupled
its
total
revenues
which
are
here
accounted
on
a
lease
basis
only,
and
we
couldn't
get
all
their
figures
for
sales
for
purposes
of
comparison.
now,
this
--
the
judge
thought
and
we
submit
to
this
court,
is
a
substantial
picture
of
movement
in
time
even
only
to
the
year
1963
which
shows
in
the
only
way
this
record
does
show
it
the
attrition
and
the
eroding
effect
of
this
decree
which
took
away
all
the
restrictive
practices
and
opened
up
the
secondhand
market.
now,
in
referring
to
international
shoe,
i
would
like
to
mention
i
think
an
error
in
the
government
brief
where
they
say
that
there
have
been
--
this
is
in
the
reply
brief
and
we
couldn't
deal
with
it
in
writing
--
they
say
there
had
been
no
innovations
in
this
market
and
that
is
one
indication
they
say
of
a
static
monopolized
situation.
of
course,
innovations
are
important
and
i
point
out
that
international
shoe
machinery
company
itself
had
put
into
the
market
during
this
period
the
so-called
thermolaster
just
as
united
shoe
had
put
into
the
market
the
injection
molder,
and
i
have
half
a
dozen
instances
of
other
companies
which
have
put
into
the
market
no
machinery
so
as
to
show
contrary
to
the
government's
contention
that
the
flexibility
and
the
entry
of
new
forces.
in
this
connection,
i
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the
brief
filed
as
to
my
side
of
the
court
by
the
consumers
of
this
machinery,
the
national
footwear
manufacturers
and
the
new
york
--
new
england
footwear
association,
which
argues
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer
the
wisdom
of
the
decree
as
it
affects
them.
they
say,
and
i
won't
endeavor
to
paraphrase,
but
they
say
in
substance
that
as
the
market
stands
even
not
withstanding
united's
share
larger
than
the
others,
the
competition
produced
is
not
only
satisfactory
for
their
purposes
but
is
better
for
their
purposes,
that
if
the
supplier's
market
were
broken
up
and
destroyed
by
the
introduction
of
a
new
full
line
company
per
force
because
they
say
it's
an
interesting
fact
based
on
what
professor
fox
said
in
his
testimony,
a
new
full
line
company
might
destroy
some
of
these
small
companies.
there
are
125
other
companies
in
the
business,
most
of
them
relatively
small,
most
of
them
as
the
judge
says
producing
only
one
or
two
machines.
it's
somewhat
like
the
grocery
situation
or
other
situations.
this
court
has
--
had
to
deal
with
--
in
the
vans
case,
a
lot
of
small
people
who
nonetheless
among
themselves
have
produced
effective
competition
as
shown
by
the
erosion
of
united's
share.
attached
to
the
-
-my
side
of
brief
are
the
sworn
statements
of
a
number
of
shoe
manufacturers
detailing
the
kind
of
competition
they
enjoy.
and
detailing
--
and
that's
why
i'm
now
referring
to
it
--
the
entry
of
new
machines.
it
happens
at
one
of
them
on
page
14a
of
this
amicus
brief,
is
made
by
a
man
who's
not
only
a
shoe
manufacturer
but
he
is
also
the
inventor
of
a
new
machine
called
the
low-ready
heel
molder
and
he
says,
“i
can
foresee
a
development
in
shoe
manufacture
which
will
render
obsolete
united's
insole
tackers,
assemblers,
and
heel
sewn
lasters.
in
fact,
my
low-ready
heel
molder
is
doing
just
that
now.”
mr.

course,
justice

mr.
ralph
m.

a
substantial
number
--
a
substantial
number,
justice
black,
a
substantial
majority.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
these
are
trade
associations
of
shoe
manufacturers.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
customers,
not
competitors
of
united.
there
are
two
of
them,
one
in
new
england
represented
by
a
council
in
boston,
another,
the
national
association.
i
forgot
the
exact
figures
of
the
membership,
which
are
given
in
the
record,
but
they're
a
substantial
majority
of
all
of
them.
and
they
say
that
the
existing
structure
of
competition
is
better
for
them.
they
give
in
many
examples
of
the
kind
of
competition,
and
i
allude
for
the
moment
if
i
may
to
what
mr.
volanette's
of
brown
shoe
company,
a
name
that's
famous
in
this
court,
what
mr.
volanette
says
at
pages
21
and
22a,
he
lists
the
18
major
categories
of
united
machines
which
i've
called
attention
to
on
table
a,
and
he
says
that
while
the
first
five
categories
of
this
type
of
machines
made
by
others
and
made
by
united
are
used
fairly
generally
on
the
majority
of
shoes,
such
of
the
remainder
as
the
machines
for
welt
sole
in
seam
training,
rough
rounding,
and
so
on,
i
won't
quote
them
all,
are
adapted
to
dying
processes
and
are
used
less
and
less.
the
mckay
machine
for
example
has
not
been
used
in
the
last
15
years.
we
stopped
doing
lose
nailing
ten
years
ago.
no
stitch
done
to
speak
of
have
been
made
for
the
last
10
years.
now,
i
adduce
these
facts
and
there
are
many
of
them
on
the
record
to
show
the
court
not
only
that
the
united
machines
have
passed
for
the
majority
out
of
our
control,
but
that
new
processes
and
techniques
have
come
in
which
have
made
simplified
manufacture,
flexible
soles,
and
cement
adhesive
available
in
such
degree
that
the
old
types
of
machines
that
which
united
had
had
such
a
large
percentage
in
1953
are
no
longer
being
put
out
or
utilized.
i
can't
say
they're
no
longer
being
utilized.
one
manufacturer
like
nettleton
continues
to
make
the
welt
shoes
using
the
old
types.
but
this
record
is
full
of
evidence
and
these
affidavits
are
full
of
the
proof
that
the
coming
in
of
new
processes
as
further
obsoleted
the
united
type
of
control
through
machinery
invented
by
united.
now,
it's
these
facts
that
make
the
new
processes
available
to
the
manufacturers
in
such
degree
that
they
can
dispense
with
the
united
machines
in
great
quantity.
and
there
we
come
to
the
relative
--
one
of
the
defects
of
the
62%
figure
because
the
62%
figure
as
a
market
share
figure
which
mr.
turner
has
given
his
sole
attention
to
is
a
figure
based
on
revenues
received
in
the
year
1963
from
--
not
only
from
machine
sold,
how
machines
put
out
on
lease
in
that
year
but
from
machines
leased
in
prior
years,
the
old
machines,
the
welt
type
for
which
revenues
are
received
in
‘63
so
that
the
‘63
comparative
revenue
measure
of
united
and
i
admit
it's
a
good
measure
but
that
‘63
comparative
revenue
measure
which
make
62%
is
based
largely
on
all
transactions.
now,
another
figure
which
mr.
turner
did
not
find
time
to
mention
is
found
in
the
judges
findings
as
a
48%
figure
--
a
48%
figure.
48%
represents
the
revenue
measure
of
the
united
production
shipped
in
the
year
1963.
this
was
obtained
and
it's
a
very
conservative
figure.
this
is
found
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
this
was
obtained
by
converting
to
sale
value,
the
united
machines
which
were
shipped
on
lease
in
that
year
in
order
to
make
it
comparable,
we
have
to
do
that.
and
then
taking
the
sale
figures
of
three
of
our
largest
competitors
and
taking
all
other
competitor
sale
figures
in
that
year
and
you
will
see
that
in
that
year,
we
have
48.6%.
now
even
that
eliminates
some
lease
revenues
of
the
others
that
we
could
not
put
into
the
table
so
that
48%
is
probably
a
little
high
and
that
was
the
year
'63.
the
government
i
think
is
quite
wrong
in
saying
it
in
its
reply
brief
that
we
claim
the
62%
figures
clearly
erroneous.
we
never
said
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
we
admit
it's
a
good
measure
if
you
want
to
take
in
all
the
revenue.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
i
think
would
be
the
interest
of
this
court
as
to
how
the
decree
is
working,
the
48%
which
is
the
shipments
in
that
year
comparative
with
the
others
is
the
cutting
edge
of
the
new
business.
the
48%
shows
how
the
trend
is
going
and
i
would
assume
a
48%
in
1963
might
be
reflected
in
a
lower
percent
today.
of
course,
the
court
cannot
take
the
temperature
of
the
market
every
5
or
10
years
but
neither
the
government
nor
we
have
an
information
that
the
percentage
is
going
up
rather
than
down.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
i
think
it
would
have
been
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
these
are
new
shipments
and
in
‘63,
the
sale
price
of
the
old
purchased
would
have
to
be
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
lease
value.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
yes.
that
is
so
--
that
is
so
sir,
except
for
leases
that
are
expired
and
our
point
had
been
the
63
measure
which
results
in
62%
takes
into
effect
past
transactions.
now
that
maybe
entirely
legitimate,
it
shows
market
share
in
63.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
is
true
sir
and
i
should
have
paid
it
that
as
the
judge
found,
not
withstanding
the
opportunity
to
buy
on
an
equivalent
basis.
still,
a
great
majority
of
acquisitions
are
initially
by
lease.
as
the
judge
points
out
90%
of
all
new
shipments
in
the
whole
period
are
on
a
lease
basis
so
that
the
customer
can
try
out
the
machine,
see
if
he
likes
it
and
during
the
lease
term
he
has
an
option
to
buy
at
anytime
on
a
basis
that
is
equivalent
roughly
so
that
we
have
in
the
other
case
that
your
honors
have,
the
claim
being
that
the
inability
to
buy
was
an
injury.
we
have
with
the
ability
to
buy
fully
installed,
reinstated
by
the
decree,
we
have
nonetheless
effect
that
the
great
majority
of
90%
initially
lease
because
they
find
it
convenient.
they're
maybe
new
machine
types,
injection
molding
machines
are
coming
in
to
obsolete
all
types.
that's
an
expensive
machine.
they
would
rather
take
it
on
ravel
and
decide
later
whether
to
buy
it.
the
low-ready
heel
molder
is
being
invented
that
might
come
in
and
throw
out
some
united
machine
so
it's
better
to
be
on
a
lease
basis
and
then
convert
later
and
the
judges
findings
are
quite
lucent
on
that
subject.

mr.

is

into
this.
the
judge
did
and
when
the
judge
did
embrace
his
findings
in
the
framework
of
the
swift
rule
but
since
he
said
what
has
happened
is
what
i
provided
for
and
i
foresaw
and
i
do
not
think
the
application
of
swift
in
this

hurts
the

antitrust
program
as
mr.

seems
to
think
it
does.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
justice
black.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
your
honor.
the
government
was
not
cut
off.
the
government
made
strenuous
efforts
to
show
that
there
had
not
been
enough
erosion
and
the
government
even
went
so
far
as
to
incorporate
in
the
record
an
exhibit
which
we
must
regard
as
founded
misleading
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honor's
attention
to
at
that
time.
i
think
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court
may
have
been
directed
to
a
figure
at
page
11
of
the
government
brief
which
says
that
in
1963,
united
accounted
for
approximately
84%
in
1963
he
say.
84%
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
page
11.
84%
of
the
18
major
machines
listed
in
the
original
decree.
that
is
a
very
injurious
statement
and
it's
profoundly
wrong.
it
is
based
on
plaintiff's
exhibit
53
as
to
which
we
take
into
our
brief
as
an
appendix,
our
refutation
of
that
exhibit.
of
course,
if
the
court
felt
that
after
eight
years,
united
still
had
84%.
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference
but
this
figure
as
it's
shown
in
our
analysis
of
the
evidence
of
the
witness
is
obtained
by
excluding
from
the
count,
all
machines
introduced
by
anybody
since
1955
that
do
not
do
the
same
work
as
machines
currently
made
by
united.
in
this
way,
through
a
very
false
analysis,
the
government
witness
struck
out
of
our
senses,
3,000
competitive
machines
as
against
the
179
of
the
united
machines
similarly
excluded.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of

mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
none
whatever.
mr.
ralph
m.

we
could
update
it.
mr.
ralph
m.

we
could
update
it.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that's
what
it
boils
down
to
on
a
full
analysis
of
the
record
as
against
the
findings.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it's
all
over
his
findings
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.

well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
pinpoint
one.
finding
--
let's
see.
i
say
finding
7
is
one.
finding
11,
finding
10
where
new
entrance
are
described
as
increasing
from
11
to

to

year

i
would
say
it's
pretty
well
throughout
his
findings
but
i've
named
the
principle
ones.
mr.
ralph
m.

i
was
about
to
refer
--
mr.
ralph
m.

yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
whipple
has
just
put
that
on
my
hand
and
i
was
about
to
read
it.
that's
a
summary
of
a
great
many
finding.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
you
did
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
believe
the
government
intended
to
say.
i
think
they
intended
to
say
that
they
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
divestiture
because
on
the
fullest
examination
of
the
erosive
power
of
the
decree,
the
court
found
the
erosion
had
proceeded
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
was
continuing.
i
would
say
that
was
a
hearing
and
a
full
hearing
on
the
effect
of
the
decree.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
they
attacked
the
adequacy
of
the
remedies
which
were
taken
which
they
recommended
to
this
court
on
the
appeal
as
being
sufficient.
they
wanted
more
but
they
didn't
appeal
for
more.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
now,
i
have
my
time
as
coming
to
a
close
and
i
would
like
to
elude
two
other
important
matters
dealing
with
the
adequacy
and
fullness
of
the
inquiry
into
erosion
that
i
think
the
mr.
chief
justice
acquired
about.
since
the
original
decree
was
predicated
on
a
machine
count
as
you
will
find
in
the
beginning
of
judge
wyzanski's
findings
where
large
percentages
by
count
or
attributed
to
united
in
the
30
categories
machines.
we
began
the
trial
with
an
elaborate
census
of
all
machines
counted
in
a
47
sample
factories
which
census
was
then
projected
by
statisticians
to
the
universe
of
all
the
thousand
factories
in
the
country.
i
have
in
front
of
me
exhibit
d
(8)
which
is
that
census
which
resulted
in
a
machine
count.
and
the
machine
count
shows
that
in
1963,
the
number
of
machines
on
lease
out
of
the
whole
of
the
others,
the
number
of
machines
on
lease
was
only
15%,
the
number
of
united
machines
on
lease
as
against
all
machines
in
the
47
factories
and
hence
of
the
universe.
the
number
of
machines
purchased
from
united
was
31%.
the
number
of
united
machines
acquired
from
others
and
that
is
the
secondhand
market
was
6%.
the
competitive
machines
in
the
field
in
1963
was
47%.
this
is
exhibit
21.
exhibit
60(a)
has
similar
figures.
i
will
not
take
further
time
to
elaborate
that
but
i
can
assure
you
your
honors,
an
elaborate
machine
count
was
debated
at
a
great
length
between
counsel.
a
further
element
that
i
had
asked
that
i
put
on
your
honors
bench
but
there
may
not
be
time
to
describe
is
the
basis
for
the
testimony
of
dr.
bertrand
fox
who
testified
as
an
economist
to
the
existence
of
fluidity,
dynamism,
full
movement,
new
suppliers
in
the
market
and
as
a
basis
for
that
there
was
put
in
the
evidence
the
most
elaborate
study
that's
ever
been
made
of
the
process
of
shoe
manufacturing
what
your
honors
have
before
you
as
exhibit
d(54)
and
which
shows
--
i'm
now
turning
to
section
4
dealing
with
lasting
which
shows
that
in
the
method
--
in
each
method,
each
step
a
flow
through
the
factory.
the
shoe
manufacturer
has
available
to
him
in
the
different
operations
alternative
machines.
this
illustrates
what
i
said
at
the
beginning,
the
heterogeneity
of
the
market.
it's
not
a
simple
monolithic
market
as
with
wheat
crashed
with
aluminum.
these
machines
differ
among
themselves.
you
do
not
need
all
the
115
united
types
to
make
machines.
as
it
shown
with
the
testimony
to
make
shoes,
you
can
make
shoes
with
a
selection
of
different
processes.
now
the
witness,
some
of
whose
testimony
i
have
adduced
as
an
appendix
to
the
blue
appellee's
brief,
the
witness
went
through
this
lasting
table
and
explains
what
alternatives
were
available.
on
the
basis
of
these
alternative
choices
and
the
break
up
in
the
system
of
machine
distribution
which
the
decree
is
brought
about,
dr.
fox
testified
in
detail
in
under
cross-examination,
he
is
an
imminent
economist,
a
colleague
known
to
mr.
turner
at
harvard.
he
testified
to
the
existence
of
full,
free
competition
and
the
gradual
reduction
of
the
united
share
through
the
entry
of
all
these
competitive
alternatives.
i
come
therefore
without
spending
more
time
on
that
to
the
conclusion
of
what
i
had
to
say
to
the
court
that
has
a
great
deal
more
in
the
record
but
i
must
ask
myself,
what
is
the
purpose
of
an
attempt
to
reverse
this
decree
and
send
us
back
to
a
new
count
of
the
erosion?
what
harm
is
done
by
allowing
this
process
of
gradual
liquidation
which
has
been
going
on
for
eight
years
and
now
13
years
and
will
go
indefinitely.
what
harm
is
done
by
letting
that
continue.
what
is
the
public
benefit
of
breaking
up
an
existing
competitive
system
which
is
working
satisfactorily
and
doing
the
surgical
operation
of
divestiture
which
will
certainly
hurt
investors
no
matter
what
pious
phrases
are
used
in
the
decree.
it'll
certainly
hurt
investors,
but
which
the
customers
themselves
do
not
want.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
mere
economic
exercise
in
how
swift
is
to
be
interpreted
in
some
cases
that
are
not
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
gesture
of
the
impatience
which
has
no
reason
for
the
attorney
general
to
feel
in
this
case
and
in
some,
whatever
the
percentage
is
that
mr.
turner
would
accept
as
an
adequate
measure
after
a
term
of
year,
say
40%
in
the
case
of
the
united
occupancy.
how
much
time
is
he
willing
to
give
in
the
slow
passage
of
time
for
that
percentage
to
be
attained?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
certainly
think
that
but
i
would
not
presume
to
say
that
he
committed
an
error
of
law
unless
your
honor
so
find.
it
seems
to
me
that
while
swift
does
not
apply
in
its
strictness
to
this
but
for
the
language
of
swift,
the
effect
--
there
should
be
a
change
without
new
conditions
is
what
we
have
in
all
litigated
decrees
as
well
as
consent
decree.
there's
really
no
issue
to
be
served.
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
comes
down
to
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
that
is
so
and
it
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
the
swift
standard,
apply
it
to
that
set
of
facts
is
in
the
interest
of
the
order
of
the
development
and
settlement
of
the
law.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
united
shoe
machinery
corporation,
i
would
like
not
only
to
emphasize
that
that
defendant
has
faithfully
complied
with
the
detailed
decree
which
this
court
affirmed
in
1954.
but
then,
the
shoe
machinery
business
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
is
a
business
of
heterogeneous
and
diverse
character,
very
different
from
one
treating
a
homogeneous
product
adaptable
to
a
62%
level.
and
i
should
like
also
at
the
outset
to
take
advantage
of
the
assistant
attorney
general's
candid
--
commendably
candid
admission
that
the
government
does
not
claim
that
there
is
any
unlawful
monopolization
in
the
legal
sense,
i
quoted
his
words,
affected
by
the
defendant
after
the
operative
date
of
the
decree.
in
fact,
mr.
turner
went
further
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
there's
no
indication
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
would
remain
to
be
determined
on
new
issues
and
new
showings
of
fact,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
if
you
had
the
market
power
sufficient
to
exclude,
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
could
also
be
examined
into
but
none
of
that
is
in
this
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
i
think
that
i
can
demonstrate
by
the
reference
to
the
findings
as
to
the
entry
of
new
competition
and
the
profitability
of
new
competitors
that
the
price
control,
which
you
referred
to,
mr.
justice
white,
could
not
be
in
this
record.
in
fact,
i
also
embrace
the
further
frank
statement
by
mr.
turner
that
there
is
no
violation
in
the
maintenance
of
a
mix
mere
62%
of
the
market.
but
i
shall
at
once
proceed
i
think
to
try
to
convince
your
honors
that
this
62%
which
has
been
referred
to
so
much
in
the
argument
and
in
the
government
brief
is
a
mere
measure
taken
at
a
point
of
time
five
years
ago
that
there
are
other
measures
showing
a
lower
percentage
of
united's
occupancy
and
that
both
measures
are
and
have
been
moving
downward.
conspicuously
absent
from
both
the
assistant
attorney
general's
argument
and
the
government's
brief
is
the
reference
to
the
motion
in
this
market,
which
is
a
motion
downward.
but
before
i
proceed
to
that
development,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
further
embrace
if
i
may
the
statement
which
i
think
as
erroneous
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
the
government
had
no
hearing
on
relief.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
on
this
sea
day
hearing,
so-called,
as
of
january
1,
1965,
there
was
no
separate
hearing
on
relief.
but
in
the
original
case
which
occupied
121
trial
days,
both
relief
and
liability
were
considered
at
the
same
time.
in
our
brief,
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
devoted
four
paragraphs
at
page
348
of
110
federal
supplements
to
the
request
for
dissolution.
that
request
was
insistently
pressed
by
the
government
at
that
time.
and
those
four
paragraphs
begin
with
a
single
statement
which
along
i
will
need
read,
“the
government's
proposal
that
the
court
dissolve
united
into
three
separate
manufacturing
companies
is
unrealistic.”
there's
factual
development
of
that
finding.
and
in
the
government's
pretrial,
the
proceedings
on
sea
day,
there
was
no
effort
made
and
no
evidence
adduced
to
indicate
that
that
position
now
is
in
any
way
different
from
the
position
in
1953.
in
fact,
i
may
say
that
it's
identical.
the
government
lost,
as
i
say,
its
application
to
dissolve
in
1953.
the
government
did
not
appeal.
the
government
let
the
decree
go
into
operation
upon
this
court's
affirmance
after
the
defendant's
appeal,
which
was
in
effectual
in
modifying
the
decree
in
any
particular.
with
reference
i
think
to
justice
harlan's
question
whether
the
defendant's
brief
in
this
court
particularly
adverted
to
the
review
in
ten
years
by
hasty
inspection
indicates
that
it
did
not
so
advert,
that
we
contended
throughout,
that
the
finding
of
liability
was
erroneous
and
not
in
accordance
with
previous
determinations
of
this
court
and
not
in
accordance
with
the
evidence.
however
that
may
be,
i
think
the
government
has
forgotten
that
it
represented
to
this
court
in
1954
that
there
was
an
adequate
hearing
on
relief
in
the
main
trial.
and
i
take
leave,
if
i
might
mr.
chief
justice,
to
read
a
few
words
from
page
141
of
the
government's
brief
signed
by
solicitor
general
sobeloff.
during
the
case
of
the
course
of
the
trial
which
took
121
trial
days,
the
district
judge
heard
testimony
relating
to
all
phases
of
the
industry.
he
patiently
examined
and
studied
some
thousands
of
aluminous
exhibits
which
were
admitted
into
evidence.
he
had
extended
opportunity
not
only
to
observe
what
was
wrong
with
united's
practices
but
to
explore
alternative
courses
of
conduct.
he
personally
questioned
witnesses
at
a
considerable
length
considering
the
feasibility
of
various
possible
measures
for
relief.
thus,
professor
dean
--
joel
dean
was
the
defendant's
economic
expert
--
thus,
professor
dean
was
requested
by
the
court
to
study
a
series
of
questions
relating
to
relief
and
to
testify
in
relation
to
each
of
them.
he
did
so
freely
and
exhaustively.
then
there's
a
reference
to
the
record
and
i
conclude
with
a
statement
of
the
government
counsel
in
1954
to
this
court,
“the
careful
consideration
which
underlies
the
provisions
for
relief
is
further
demonstrated
by
the
logic,
the
clarity
and
the
meticulousness
of
the
opinion
on
remedy
and
of
the
decree
itself.”
this
passage
was
preceded
by
statements
that
the
hearing
on
relief
was
conducted
with
a
hearing
on
liability.
so
to
sum
up
that
portion
of
what
i
have
to
say,
i
would
say
that
the
government
is
proceeding
on
a
misconception
that
it
has
not
hearing
on
relief,
that
it
had
a
hearing
on
relief,
that
partial
--
part
of
its
request
was
denied
and
it
failed
to
appeal,
that
the
bulk
of
its
request
as
to
a
media
rating
and
corrective
factors
in
the
market
was
accepted,
and
that
the
operative
clauses
of
the
decree
which
i
shall
now
like
to
refer
to
in
somewhat
more
detail,
have
been
extremely
affected.
i
think
that
the
government
demonstrates
its
power
in
saying,
as
i
remember
the
language
of
mr.
turner,
that
the
decree
has
been
patently
ineffective.
what
did
the
decree
attempted
to
do?
your
honors,
you
have
it
before
you
in
connection
with
a
private
trouble
damage
case
which
related
to
the
effect
of
the
decree
on
the
preceding
liability
and
conduct
of
the
defendant.
now,
this
portion
of
this
case
deals
with
the
effect
of
the
decree
upon
the
market
and
the
defendant's
conduct
after
its
effective
date.
and
in
response
to
questions
from
members
of
the
court
as
to
effective
date,
i
might
remind
the
court
that
while
this
court's
affirmance
occurred
in
june
1954,
elaborate
provisions
for
dismantling
the
leases
required
some
time
and
the
decree
began
to
operate
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
as
of
june
1,
1955
retroactive
january
1,
1955
when
the
court
approved
a
very
complex
plan
for
terminating
all
the
existing
leases
at
the
option
of
the
lessees
so
that
if
you
look
at
the
beginning
of
the
experience
period,
january
1
at
earliest
1955
up
until
the
date
of
the
statistical
studying
that
was
made
in
this
case
to
measure
market
share
and
market
power.
you
have
as
a
terminal
date
for
that
study
the
fiscal
year
1963
because
while
the
court's
directive
reports
as
of
january
1,
1965,
the
course
of
time
necessary
to
collect
information
from
not
only
the
defendant
but
125
other
suppliers
in
the
field
met
--
but
the
time
the
evidence
could
be
tended
to
the
court,
the
fiscal
year
of
1963
was
the
last
effective
date.
so
you
had
eight
years,
maybe
nine
years
of
effective
operation.
now,
at
this
point,
five
years
or
four
years
from
this
last
experience
date,
you
have
the
government
telling
you
that
a
decline
from
85%
of
market
to
62%
which
is
23
points
in
eight
years
is
not
enough.
it
seems
to
me
with
all
respect
that
is
a
rather
curious
contention,
an
untenable
contention.
i
cannot
understand
the
impatience
exhibited
in
the
government's
approach
to
the
now
demanding
and
renewing
this
surgical
treatment
of
divestiture.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
didn't
understand,
mr.
justice.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
had
not
gone
down
at
all?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
think
the
court
would
have
to
conclude
the
decree
had
not
operated
as
intended.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
i
could
say,
your
honor
that
the
aim
of
the
decree
was
to
extirpate
the
practices
for
in
number
in
clause
four
of
the
decree.
it
represented
monopolization.
i
don't
think
i'm
prepared
to
admit
that
the
decree
must
also
cut
down
one
from
one
percent
to
another,
but
i
would
say
that
the
free
application
of
competitive
forces
would
have
that
effect
and
have
had
that
effect.
as
it
shown
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
i
did
not,
but
i
think
it's
a
fair
question
and
attitude
of
any
court
to
say
that
if
the
four
practices
which
were
to
be
terminated
were
really
terminated,
the
natural
entry
of
competitive
forces
would
wear
down
the
united
occupancy
in
the
market
as
they
did.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
there
is
in
active
sense
monopolization.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
must
admit
that
that
does
seem
common
sense
and
that
has
been
the
operation
of
the
fact
here
and
it
may
be
the
operation
in
logic.
but
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
extreme
measure
that
i
think
this
court
has
set
forth
in
the
united
states
against
griffith
and
in
the
grinnell
case
and
that
judge
wyzanski
adopted
in
his
decision
was
that
monopolization
being
shown,
the
monopoly
must
be
dissipated
and
rendered
or
rendered
impotent.
now,
you
could
say
that
if
85%
was
the
result
of
monopolization,
then
the
effect
of
the
decree
would
be
to
dissipate
that
and
it
has
been.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
i
could
embrace
the
other
clause
and
render
it
impotent.
now,
i
think
i'm
prepared
to
show
that
even
if
there
were
85%
that
so
much
of
the
competition
coming
in,
if
it
even
were
ineffective,
that
we
have
a
competitive
situation.
i
hesitate,
mr.
justice
white,
to
debate
this
principle
on
facts
that
are
--
not
the
facts
of
this
record
but
on
unfavorably
to
my
contention.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
monopoly
power
has
to
be
dissipated
by
the
removal
of
monopolization.
and
if
monopolization
is
removed
by
the
extirpation
of
these
four
practices
--
i'm
just
repeating
myself
--
the
natural
flow
of
competition
coming
in
will
reduce
the
apparent
market
share.
it
has
in
this
case.
now,
your
honor,
it
seemed
to
me
to
put
a
question.
supposing
it
did
not,
supposing
it
remained
85%,
if
some
position
on
favor
to
my
case
and
not
contrary
to
the
record,
well
i
suppose
in
frankness,
one
could
say
that
even
if
with
full
entry
and
opportunity
for
competitive
forces,
the
remained
85%
in
the
united
occupancy
had
meant
only
that
united
or
whatever
was
a
dominant
producer
was
competing
on
the
basis
of
superior
skill
and
efficiency.
there's
no
law
to
the
effect.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
yes.
the
government
has
been
very
stringent.
mr.
turner's
staff
had
been
extremely
diligent
and
persistent.
they'd
asked
as
many
questions
as
they
could.
i
can
assure
the
court
that
there
were
here
in
pretrial
proceedings
a
great
massive
material
which
resulted
in
the
conclusion
that
there's
been
no
monopolization
since.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
say
that
if
there
are
no
new
facts
following
your
honor's
questions
that
it
worked
as
it
was
intended,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
reopening
since
this
decree
contemplated
a
gradual
erosion.
it's
so
stated
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
says
that
it
did
not
accomplish
desired
results.
but
the
district
court
which
framed
the
decree
thought
that
it
did
accomplish
the
desired
results.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
oh!
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
it
would.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
did
not
think
so,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
his
opinion
on
page
82
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
it
says
what
the
government
is
complaining
was
not
the
decree
did
not
work
as
expected
but
that
in
working
in
this
way,
the
decree
did
not
accomplish
what
the
government
had
prayed
for.
that
is
dissolution
as
i
take
it,
your
honor.
in
short,
the
government
petitions
the
decree
be
reversed
because
this
coerced
in
1953.
i
think
he's
there
referring
to
dissolution.
now,
as
to
more
direct
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
i
wanted
to
remind
the
court
that
conjointly
with
the
statement
in
1966
by
the
district
court,
the
intention
was
a
gradual
erosion
of
the
market
power
of
united.
you
have
the
statement
in
1953
which
explains
the
theory
of
the
decree.
as
to
the
secondhand
market
on
page
--
well,
i
have
a
pamphlet
opinion
here.
as
a
secondhand
market,
united
will
face
a
type
of
substitute
competition
which
will
gradually
weaken
the
prohibited
market
power
which
had
now
exercised.
and
then
again,
as
to
a
sales
market,
the
district
court
said
in
1953,
the
creation
of
a
sales
market
together
with
a
purging
of
the
restrictive
features
of
the
leases
will,
in
combination,
gradually
diminish
the
magnetic
hold
now
exercised
by
united
and
so
on.
now,
those
passages
are
at
page
350
of
110
federal
supplement
and
there
are
other
similar
passages
indicating
that
the
judge
was
relying
on
the
inevitability
of
gradualness.
now,
since
that
has
worked,
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
adhere
to
any
position
that
a
retention
of
85%
would
still
be
defensible.
in
fact,
the
52%
that
the
district
court
found
on
a
measure
of
comparative
revenues
to
be
the
share
of
united's
revenues,
united's
occupancy
in
1963
a
contrast
with
an
85%
eight
years
or
nine
years
ago,
possibly
a
92%
of
revenues
enjoyed
by
united
at
the
time
of
the
original
violation.
i
take
the
figure
of
92%
from
the
government's
brief
in
the
district
court,
which
is
repeated
in
the
record
on
this
hearing.
but
in
any
event,
if
it
were
only
a
decline
from
85%
to
62%
in
eight
or
ten
years,
we
should
have
a
magnificent
showing
in
an
industry
which
is
a
capital
goods
industry
with
the
machines
enjoying
a
long
machine
life
and
with
a
complicated
situation
to
rectify.
let
me
refer
a
little
more
fully
to
what
decree
was
attempting
to
do
in
1953
as
it
was
then
presented
to
this
court.
the
court
pointed
out
that
while
united's
conduct
had
been
entirely
conformable
with
the
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
new
developments
in
the
decisions
effective
about
1946
had
made
the
retention
of
the
then
market
share
by
restrictive
lease
clauses
even
though
similar
to
those
previously
adjudicated
here.
it
made
the
retention
of
market
share
by
those
lease
clauses
now
illegal
and
monopolization.
the
court
directed
that
a
plan
be
submitted,
which
as
done,
to
terminate
at
the
option
of
the
lessees
all
the
outstanding
leases
about
a
hundred
thousand
in
number.
that
plan
took
effect
as
of
june
1,
1955
as
i've
said.
and
over
a
period
of
time
beginning
in
1955,
all
the
--
all
leases
were
terminated
and
potentially
a
large
bulk
of
the
machines
then
held
by
the
lessees
--
purchased
by
the
lessees
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
which
provided
for
the
calculation
of
a
purchase
price,
including
the
cost
of
capital
of
the
shoe
machinery
--
of
the
shoe
manufacturers
as
part
of
the
elements
of
that
purchase
price.
so
that
the
leasing
system
as
it
then
existed
was
cut
out
and
regardless
of
whether
the
option
to
terminate
was
exercised
by
the
lessees
as
of
55,
56,
57
and
so
on,
the
court
directed
that
forthwith
these
restrictive
practices
stop
and
they
were
stopped.
the
court
also
provided
that
where
leasing
continued,
there
should
be
in
the
future
an
opportunity
for
purchase
at
a
price,
which
was
not
a
disadvantageous
or
not
especially
advantageous
to
leasing.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
your
honor,
i
do
realize
that
the
government
said
the
proper
standard
was
not
applied.
and
in
addressing
myself
to
that,
i
repeat
that
the
standard
adopted
in
the
framing
of
the
decree
was
the
elimination
of
market
control
in
a
gradual
measure
and
that
the
judge
has
found
after
the
full
review
that
that
gradual
elimination
is
an
accomplished
and
is
being
accomplished
and
will
continue.
the
findings
as
to
the
gradual
erosion
of
market
power,
the
findings
as
to
the
diminution
which
the
decree
envisaged
are
not
challenged
here.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
appreciate
the
question.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
on
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
i
would
think
that
if
they
show
that
monopoly
remains
even
though
a,
b
and
c
have
been
fulfilled,
then
the
result
is
the
decree
has
not
operated
as
contemplated.
now,
it's
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yeah,
it
would
entitle
them
to
relief.
now,
that
is
radically
different
than
on
the
position
here.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
manner
of
the
erosion
that
was
intended
and
so
stated
by
judge
wyzanski
in
his
findings.
but
it's
having
the
effect
of
substantially
reducing
market
share
and
market
power
of
the
united
as
originally
held
by
it
in
1953.
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
as
tables
a,
b
and
c,
a
tabulation
made
from
the
census
or
rather
from
united's
own
machinery
shipment
records
to
show
the
massive
changes
in
the
machine
inventory
and
the
going
out
of
the
old
machines
and
the
reduction
of
control
of
machines
by
united.
table
a
taken
from
united's
records
shows
the
18
major
types
on
which
most
emphasis
was
placed
because
they're
the
more
important
machines
and
as
judge
said,
the
12
minor
types
showed
much
less
market
control
by
united.
the
18
major
types
showing
the
number
that
are
on
lease
in
1955,
54,000,
the
number
shipped
since
1955,
10,000,
the
number
returned
showing
a
net
of
returns
of
16,000
machines
of
those
pre-55
types.
table
b
separates
out
the
types
or
models
adopted
since
1955
and
shows
on
the
same
basis
the
number
shipped,
the
number
returned,
and
in
both
tables,
the
number
sold.
now,
the
number
sold
both
on
what
are
called
conversion
or
transforming
leases
into
sales
or
new
sales
as
directed
by
the
decree
are
extremely
important
because
they
tend
to
create
the
secondhand
market.
and
the
position
eight
years
after
the
decree
is
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
machinery
that
were
the
instrument
of
the
monopolization
found
is
in
the
hands
of
customers
or
in
the
hands
of
the
secondhand
dealers.
we
have
in
the
record
the
statements
of
two
secondhand
dealers
and
we
have
in
the
findings
the
bulk
of
dollar
sales
of
those
dealers
showing
they
are
substantial
in
road
into
the
market,
so
united's
former
means
of
monopolization
are
now
a
means
of
competition
with
it.
now,
in
table
c,
we
have
put
together
on
the
same
18
categories
a
combination
of
the
pre-55
and
the
post-55
models,
so
that
you
can
see
in
combined
the
total
that
have
been
disposed
of
and
how
they
have
been
disposed
of.
on
another
table
overleaf
on
page
52
of
our
brief
called
table
d,
we
have
a
say
to
give
the
court
in
terms
of
dollars
a
picture
of
the
movement
overtime.
the
movement
overtime
of
not
only
united's
income
from
leases
and
sales
but
the
income
of
the
principal
competitors
whose
witnesses
we
can
get
on
the
stand.
there
were
received
an
evidence
affidavits
of
scores
of
suppliers
but
those
affidavits
did
not
contain
a
picture
of
revenue
year
by
year.
so
as
--
so
that
to
show
the
progress
of
the
erosion
that
judge
wyzanski
directed,
we
endeavored
to
get
from
the
records
of
those
competitors
we
could
get
on
the
stand
the
dollar
receipts
year
by
year
to
compare
in
their
total
with
united's
receipts.
and
in
table
d,
you
will
see
that
united's
receipts
went
down
in
the
aggregate
from
$32
million
to
$24
million,
even
though
the
latter
figure
probably
gives
some
effect
to
inflation.
and
you
will
see
that
these
12
competitors
who
were
the
only
ones
with
whom
we
could
get
figures
had
gone
up
in
the
aggregate
from
$3.5
million
to
$8
and
--
$8.10
million.
now,
of
course
there's
a
great
deal
of
variety
among
these.
some
of
them
go
up
and
down,
but
you
will
notice
that
a
number
like
cic,
an
english
company,
only
entered
the
market
in
1959,
you
will
notice
that
industrial
shoe
began
to
--
number
three,
began
to
create
a
substantial
volume
in
1959.
and
you
will
notice
that
international
shoe,
one
of
our
principal
competitors
almost
quadrupled
its
total
revenues
which
are
here
accounted
on
a
lease
basis
only,
and
we
couldn't
get
all
their
figures
for
sales
for
purposes
of
comparison.
now,
this
--
the
judge
thought
and
we
submit
to
this
court,
is
a
substantial
picture
of
movement
in
time
even
only
to
the
year
1963
which
shows
in
the
only
way
this
record
does
show
it
the
attrition
and
the
eroding
effect
of
this
decree
which
took
away
all
the
restrictive
practices
and
opened
up
the
secondhand
market.
now,
in
referring
to
international
shoe,
i
would
like
to
mention
i
think
an
error
in
the
government
brief
where
they
say
that
there
have
been
--
this
is
in
the
reply
brief
and
we
couldn't
deal
with
it
in
writing
--
they
say
there
had
been
no
innovations
in
this
market
and
that
is
one
indication
they
say
of
a
static
monopolized
situation.
of
course,
innovations
are
important
and
i
point
out
that
international
shoe
machinery
company
itself
had
put
into
the
market
during
this
period
the
so-called
thermolaster
just
as
united
shoe
had
put
into
the
market
the
injection
molder,
and
i
have
half
a
dozen
instances
of
other
companies
which
have
put
into
the
market
no
machinery
so
as
to
show
contrary
to
the
government's
contention
that
the
flexibility
and
the
entry
of
new
forces.
in
this
connection,
i
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the
brief
filed
as
to
my
side
of
the
court
by
the
consumers
of
this
machinery,
the
national
footwear
manufacturers
and
the
new
york
--
new
england
footwear
association,
which
argues
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer
the
wisdom
of
the
decree
as
it
affects
them.
they
say,
and
i
won't
endeavor
to
paraphrase,
but
they
say
in
substance
that
as
the
market
stands
even
not
withstanding
united's
share
larger
than
the
others,
the
competition
produced
is
not
only
satisfactory
for
their
purposes
but
is
better
for
their
purposes,
that
if
the
supplier's
market
were
broken
up
and
destroyed
by
the
introduction
of
a
new
full
line
company
per
force
because
they
say
it's
an
interesting
fact
based
on
what
professor
fox
said
in
his
testimony,
a
new
full
line
company
might
destroy
some
of
these
small
companies.
there
are
125
other
companies
in
the
business,
most
of
them
relatively
small,
most
of
them
as
the
judge
says
producing
only
one
or
two
machines.
it's
somewhat
like
the
grocery
situation
or
other
situations.
this
court
has
--
had
to
deal
with
--
in
the
vans
case,
a
lot
of
small
people
who
nonetheless
among
themselves
have
produced
effective
competition
as
shown
by
the
erosion
of
united's
share.
attached
to
the
-
-my
side
of
brief
are
the
sworn
statements
of
a
number
of
shoe
manufacturers
detailing
the
kind
of
competition
they
enjoy.
and
detailing
--
and
that's
why
i'm
now
referring
to
it
--
the
entry
of
new
machines.
it
happens
at
one
of
them
on
page
14a
of
this
amicus
brief,
is
made
by
a
man
who's
not
only
a
shoe
manufacturer
but
he
is
also
the
inventor
of
a
new
machine
called
the
low-ready
heel
molder
and
he
says,
“i
can
foresee
a
development
in
shoe
manufacture
which
will
render
obsolete
united's
insole
tackers,
assemblers,
and
heel
sewn
lasters.
in
fact,
my
low-ready
heel
molder
is
doing
just
that
now.”

customers,
not

there
are
two
of
them,
one
in
new

represented
by
a
council
in
boston,
another,
the
national
association.
i
forgot
the
exact
figures
of
the
membership,
which
are
given
in
the
record,
but
they're
a
substantial
majority
of
all
of
them.
and
they
say
that
the
existing
structure
of
competition
is
better
for
them.
they
give
in
many
examples
of
the
kind
of
competition,
and
i
allude
for
the
moment
if
i
may
to
what
mr.
volanette's
of
brown
shoe
company,
a
name
that's
famous
in
this
court,
what
mr.
volanette
says
at
pages
21
and
22a,
he
lists
the
18
major
categories
of
united
machines
which
i've
called
attention
to
on
table
a,
and
he
says
that
while
the
first
five
categories
of
this
type
of
machines
made
by
others
and
made
by
united
are
used
fairly
generally
on
the
majority
of
shoes,
such
of
the
remainder
as
the
machines
for
welt
sole
in
seam
training,
rough
rounding,
and
so
on,
i
won't
quote
them
all,
are
adapted
to
dying
processes
and
are
used
less
and
less.
the
mckay
machine
for
example
has
not
been
used
in
the
last
15
years.
we
stopped
doing
lose
nailing
ten
years
ago.
no
stitch
done
to
speak
of
have
been
made
for
the
last
10
years.
now,
i
adduce
these
facts
and
there
are
many
of
them
on
the
record
to
show
the
court
not
only
that
the
united
machines
have
passed
for
the
majority
out
of
our
control,
but
that
new
processes
and
techniques
have
come
in
which
have
made
simplified
manufacture,
flexible
soles,
and
cement
adhesive
available
in
such
degree
that
the
old
types
of
machines
that
which
united
had
had
such
a
large
percentage
in
1953
are
no
longer
being
put
out
or
utilized.
i
can't
say
they're
no
longer
being
utilized.
one
manufacturer
like
nettleton
continues
to
make
the
welt
shoes
using
the
old
types.
but
this
record
is
full
of
evidence
and
these
affidavits
are
full
of
the
proof
that
the
coming
in
of
new
processes
as
further
obsoleted
the
united
type
of
control
through
machinery
invented
by
united.
now,
it's
these
facts
that
make
the
new
processes
available
to
the
manufacturers
in
such
degree
that
they
can
dispense
with
the
united
machines
in
great
quantity.
and
there
we
come
to
the
relative
--
one
of
the
defects
of
the
62%
figure
because
the
62%
figure
as
a
market
share
figure
which
mr.
turner
has
given
his
sole
attention
to
is
a
figure
based
on
revenues
received
in
the
year
1963
from
--
not
only
from
machine
sold,
how
machines
put
out
on
lease
in
that
year
but
from
machines
leased
in
prior
years,
the
old
machines,
the
welt
type
for
which
revenues
are
received
in
‘63
so
that
the
‘63
comparative
revenue
measure
of
united
and
i
admit
it's
a
good
measure
but
that
‘63
comparative
revenue
measure
which
make
62%
is
based
largely
on
all
transactions.
now,
another
figure
which
mr.
turner
did
not
find
time
to
mention
is
found
in
the
judges
findings
as
a
48%
figure
--
a
48%
figure.
48%
represents
the
revenue
measure
of
the
united
production
shipped
in
the
year
1963.
this
was
obtained
and
it's
a
very
conservative
figure.
this
is
found
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
this
was
obtained
by
converting
to
sale
value,
the
united
machines
which
were
shipped
on
lease
in
that
year
in
order
to
make
it
comparable,
we
have
to
do
that.
and
then
taking
the
sale
figures
of
three
of
our
largest
competitors
and
taking
all
other
competitor
sale
figures
in
that
year
and
you
will
see
that
in
that
year,
we
have
48.6%.
now
even
that
eliminates
some
lease
revenues
of
the
others
that
we
could
not
put
into
the
table
so
that
48%
is
probably
a
little
high
and
that
was
the
year
'63.
the
government
i
think
is
quite
wrong
in
saying
it
in
its
reply
brief
that
we
claim
the
62%
figures
clearly
erroneous.
we
never
said
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
we
admit
it's
a
good
measure
if
you
want
to
take
in
all
the
revenue.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
i
think
would
be
the
interest
of
this
court
as
to
how
the
decree
is
working,
the
48%
which
is
the
shipments
in
that
year
comparative
with
the
others
is
the
cutting
edge
of
the
new
business.
the
48%
shows
how
the
trend
is
going
and
i
would
assume
a
48%
in
1963
might
be
reflected
in
a
lower
percent
today.
of
course,
the
court
cannot
take
the
temperature
of
the
market
every
5
or
10
years
but
neither
the
government
nor
we
have
an
information
that
the
percentage
is
going
up
rather
than
down.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
i
think
it
would
have
been
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
these
are
new
shipments
and
in
‘63,
the
sale
price
of
the
old
purchased
would
have
to
be
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
lease
value.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
yes.
that
is
so
--
that
is
so
sir,
except
for
leases
that
are
expired
and
our
point
had
been
the
63
measure
which
results
in
62%
takes
into
effect
past
transactions.
now
that
maybe
entirely
legitimate,
it
shows
market
share
in
63.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
is
true
sir
and
i
should
have
paid
it
that
as
the
judge
found,
not
withstanding
the
opportunity
to
buy
on
an
equivalent
basis.
still,
a
great
majority
of
acquisitions
are
initially
by
lease.
as
the
judge
points
out
90%
of
all
new
shipments
in
the
whole
period
are
on
a
lease
basis
so
that
the
customer
can
try
out
the
machine,
see
if
he
likes
it
and
during
the
lease
term
he
has
an
option
to
buy
at
anytime
on
a
basis
that
is
equivalent
roughly
so
that
we
have
in
the
other
case
that
your
honors
have,
the
claim
being
that
the
inability
to
buy
was
an
injury.
we
have
with
the
ability
to
buy
fully
installed,
reinstated
by
the
decree,
we
have
nonetheless
effect
that
the
great
majority
of
90%
initially
lease
because
they
find
it
convenient.
they're
maybe
new
machine
types,
injection
molding
machines
are
coming
in
to
obsolete
all
types.
that's
an
expensive
machine.
they
would
rather
take
it
on
ravel
and
decide
later
whether
to
buy
it.
the
low-ready
heel
molder
is
being
invented
that
might
come
in
and
throw
out
some
united
machine
so
it's
better
to
be
on
a
lease
basis
and
then
convert
later
and
the
judges
findings
are
quite
lucent
on
that
subject.

mr.

into

the
judge
did
and
when
the
judge
did
embrace
his
findings
in
the
framework
of
the
swift
rule
but
since
he
said
what
has
happened
is
what
i
provided
for
and
i
foresaw
and
i
do
not
think
the
application
of
swift
in
this
case
hurts
the
governments
antitrust
program
as
mr.
turner
seems
to
think
it
does.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
justice
black.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
your
honor.
the
government
was
not
cut
off.
the
government
made
strenuous
efforts
to
show
that
there
had
not
been
enough
erosion
and
the
government
even
went
so
far
as
to
incorporate
in
the
record
an
exhibit
which
we
must
regard
as
founded
misleading
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honor's
attention
to
at
that
time.
i
think
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court
may
have
been
directed
to
a
figure
at
page
11
of
the
government
brief
which
says
that
in
1963,
united
accounted
for
approximately
84%
in
1963
he
say.
84%
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
page
11.
84%
of
the
18
major
machines
listed
in
the
original
decree.
that
is
a
very
injurious
statement
and
it's
profoundly
wrong.
it
is
based
on
plaintiff's
exhibit
53
as
to
which
we
take
into
our
brief
as
an
appendix,
our
refutation
of
that
exhibit.
of
course,
if
the
court
felt
that
after
eight
years,
united
still
had
84%.
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference
but
this
figure
as
it's
shown
in
our
analysis
of
the
evidence
of
the
witness
is
obtained
by
excluding
from
the
count,
all
machines
introduced
by
anybody
since
1955
that
do
not
do
the
same
work
as
machines
currently
made
by
united.
in
this
way,
through
a
very
false
analysis,
the
government
witness
struck
out
of
our
senses,
3,000
competitive
machines
as
against
the
179
of
the
united
machines
similarly
excluded.
mr.
ralph

carson

mr.

that's
what
it
boils
down
to
on
a
full
analysis
of
the

against
the
findings.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it's
all
over
his
findings
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
pinpoint
one.
finding
--
let's
see.
i
say
finding
7
is
one.
finding
11,
finding
10
where
new
entrance
are
described
as
increasing
from
11
to
19
to
26
every
three
year
period.
i
would
say
it's
pretty
well
throughout
his
findings
but
i've
named
the
principle
ones.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
was
about
to
refer
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
whipple
has
just
put
that
on
my
hand
and
i
was
about
to
read
it.
that's
a
summary
of
a
great
many
finding.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
you
did
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
believe
the
government
intended
to
say.
i
think
they
intended
to
say
that
they
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
divestiture
because
on
the
fullest
examination
of
the
erosive
power
of
the
decree,
the
court
found
the
erosion
had
proceeded
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
was
continuing.
i
would
say
that
was
a
hearing
and
a
full
hearing
on
the
effect
of
the
decree.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
they
attacked
the
adequacy
of
the
remedies
which
were
taken
which
they
recommended
to
this
court
on
the
appeal
as
being
sufficient.
they
wanted
more
but
they
didn't
appeal
for
more.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
now,
i
have
my
time
as
coming
to
a
close
and
i
would
like
to
elude
two
other
important
matters
dealing
with
the
adequacy
and
fullness
of
the
inquiry
into
erosion
that
i
think
the
mr.
chief
justice
acquired
about.
since
the
original
decree
was
predicated
on
a
machine
count
as
you
will
find
in
the
beginning
of
judge
wyzanski's
findings
where
large
percentages
by
count
or
attributed
to
united
in
the
30
categories
machines.
we
began
the
trial
with
an
elaborate
census
of
all
machines
counted
in
a
47
sample
factories
which
census
was
then
projected
by
statisticians
to
the
universe
of
all
the
thousand
factories
in
the
country.
i
have
in
front
of
me
exhibit
d
(8)
which
is
that
census
which
resulted
in
a
machine
count.
and
the
machine
count
shows
that
in
1963,
the
number
of
machines
on
lease
out
of
the
whole
of
the
others,
the
number
of
machines
on
lease
was
only
15%,
the
number
of
united
machines
on
lease
as
against
all
machines
in
the
47
factories
and
hence
of
the
universe.
the
number
of
machines
purchased
from
united
was
31%.
the
number
of
united
machines
acquired
from
others
and
that
is
the
secondhand
market
was
6%.
the
competitive
machines
in
the
field
in
1963
was
47%.
this
is
exhibit
21.
exhibit
60(a)
has
similar
figures.
i
will
not
take
further
time
to
elaborate
that
but
i
can
assure
you
your
honors,
an
elaborate
machine
count
was
debated
at
a
great
length
between
counsel.
a
further
element
that
i
had
asked
that
i
put
on
your
honors
bench
but
there
may
not
be
time
to
describe
is
the
basis
for
the
testimony
of
dr.
bertrand
fox
who
testified
as
an
economist
to
the
existence
of
fluidity,
dynamism,
full
movement,
new
suppliers
in
the
market
and
as
a
basis
for
that
there
was
put
in
the
evidence
the
most
elaborate
study
that's
ever
been
made
of
the
process
of
shoe
manufacturing
what
your
honors
have
before
you
as
exhibit
d(54)
and
which
shows
--
i'm
now
turning
to
section
4
dealing
with
lasting
which
shows
that
in
the
method
--
in
each
method,
each
step
a
flow
through
the
factory.
the
shoe
manufacturer
has
available
to
him
in
the
different
operations
alternative
machines.
this
illustrates
what
i
said
at
the
beginning,
the
heterogeneity
of
the
market.
it's
not
a
simple
monolithic
market
as
with
wheat
crashed
with
aluminum.
these
machines
differ
among
themselves.
you
do
not
need
all
the
115
united
types
to
make
machines.
as
it
shown
with
the
testimony
to
make
shoes,
you
can
make
shoes
with
a
selection
of
different
processes.
now
the
witness,
some
of
whose
testimony
i
have
adduced
as
an
appendix
to
the
blue
appellee's
brief,
the
witness
went
through
this
lasting
table
and
explains
what
alternatives
were
available.
on
the
basis
of
these
alternative
choices
and
the
break
up
in
the
system
of
machine
distribution
which
the
decree
is
brought
about,
dr.
fox
testified
in
detail
in
under
cross-examination,
he
is
an
imminent
economist,
a
colleague
known
to
mr.
turner
at
harvard.
he
testified
to
the
existence
of
full,
free
competition
and
the
gradual
reduction
of
the
united
share
through
the
entry
of
all
these
competitive
alternatives.
i
come
therefore
without
spending
more
time
on
that
to
the
conclusion
of
what
i
had
to
say
to
the
court
that
has
a
great
deal
more
in
the
record
but
i
must
ask
myself,
what
is
the
purpose
of
an
attempt
to
reverse
this
decree
and
send
us
back
to
a
new
count
of
the
erosion?
what
harm
is
done
by
allowing
this
process
of
gradual
liquidation
which
has
been
going
on
for
eight
years
and
now
13
years
and
will
go
indefinitely.
what
harm
is
done
by
letting
that
continue.
what
is
the
public
benefit
of
breaking
up
an
existing
competitive
system
which
is
working
satisfactorily
and
doing
the
surgical
operation
of
divestiture
which
will
certainly
hurt
investors
no
matter
what
pious
phrases
are
used
in
the
decree.
it'll
certainly
hurt
investors,
but
which
the
customers
themselves
do
not
want.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
mere
economic
exercise
in
how
swift
is
to
be
interpreted
in
some
cases
that
are
not
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
gesture
of
the
impatience
which
has
no
reason
for
the
attorney
general
to
feel
in
this
case
and
in
some,
whatever
the
percentage
is
that
mr.
turner
would
accept
as
an
adequate
measure
after
a
term
of
year,
say
40%
in
the
case
of
the
united
occupancy.
how
much
time
is
he
willing
to
give
in
the
slow
passage
of
time
for
that
percentage
to
be
attained?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would
certainly
think
that
but
i
would
not
presume
to
say
that
he
committed
an
error
of
law
unless
your
honor
so
find.
it
seems
to
me
that
while
swift
does
not
apply
in
its
strictness
to
this
but
for
the
language
of
swift,
the
effect
--
there
should
be
a
change
without
new
conditions
is
what
we
have
in
all
litigated
decrees
as
well
as
consent
decree.
there's
really
no
issue
to
be
served.
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
comes
down
to
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
that
is
so
and
it
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
the
swift
standard,
apply
it
to
that
set
of
facts
is
in
the
interest
of
the
order
of
the
development
and
settlement
of
the
law.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
