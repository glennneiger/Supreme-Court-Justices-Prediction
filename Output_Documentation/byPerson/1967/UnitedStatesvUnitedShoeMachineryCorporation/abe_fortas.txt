justice

fortas
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
crutch
of
the
problem
here
is
that
the
government
did
not
allege
or
claim
any
new
or
independent
violations
to
entrust

justice
abe
fortas
the
discussed
law
and
what
you
did
was
to
say
that
subsequent

that
circumstances
subsequent
to
the

showed
that
the

not
achieved
its
objective
and
therefore
should
be
modified,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
turner,
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
government's
right
to
reopen
a
decree
in
a
consent
--
in
decree
situations
and
on
one
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
litigated
case?
let's
assume
that
there's
no
provision
for
re
--
reexamination
or
reopening
the
decree,
and
either
one
of
them.
would
you
make
a
distinction
from
the
theory
that
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
between
a
consent
decree
and
a
decree
after
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
making
--
basing
the
distinction
upon
the
absence
of
any
finding
of
violation
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
typical
consent
decree.
and
you're
saying
that
since
that
is
so,
the
government
would
have
to
come
in
and
allege
a
violation
of
law
and
prove
the
violation
of
law
before
it
could
get
an
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
distinguish
the
part
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes.
i
think
you
would
--
if
i
may
suggest
that
--
that
you
would
want
to
confine
the
statement
that
you
just
made
to
those
consent
decrees
in
which
there
has
been
no
finding
of
liability.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
so
much,
but
may
i
ask
you
this,
do
we
have
before
us
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
matter
of
substance
the
decree
should
be
modified
or
whether
the
district
court
should
whether
in
theory,
modification
is
available
on
appropriate
showing
by
the
government?
do
we
have
both
of
those
or
just
the
latter?
justice
abe
fortas
within
a
reasonable
period
--
justice
abe
fortas
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
after
what?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
--
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about
but
i
don't
see
why
you
say
in
a
reasonable
time
after
the
entry
of
the
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
if
that's
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
ten
years
reasonable?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
would
you
look
just
at
the
calendar
to
determine
what's
reasonable?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
very
well
be,
that
hearing
you
have
a
determination
of
what
is
a
reasonable
time
in
the
ten-year
provision,
but
when
you
claim
a
general
right
and
the
government
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
modification
of
decree
in
equity
in
an
antitrust
case,
and
then
you
say
that
it's
got
to
be
exercised
within
a
reasonable
time
after
entry
of
the
decree,
this
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
go
--
you'd
have
to
illuminate
the
your
theory
a
little
more
for
me
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
can
see
the
relationship
of
that
to
the
principal
for
what
you're
contending
because
what
you're
in
effect
is
saying
is
--
i
understand
basically
is
that
an
antirust
decree
sets
out
a
formula
for
the
company
within
a
particular
industry
to
operate
in
the
indefinite
future.
and
if
the
facts
demonstrate
that
at
some
time
the
decree
has
ceased
to
serve
the
purposes
of
the
law
which
was
intended
to
serve,
the
court
--
the
government
can
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
and
seek
a
modification
so
as
to
bring
the
decree
in
line
with
the
purposes
of
brand
new
practices
and
not
the
purposes
of
the
company.
but
what
time
has
to
do
with
that,
i
don't
see
at
the
moment
maybe
being
held.
justice
abe
fortas
no
because
you
might
see
it
as
a
suggestion
from
me
and
find
that
he's
not
a
member
of
the
board.
justice
abe
fortas
you've
now
moved
a
little
bit
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
different
from
taking
the
date
of
the
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
--
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
lectures
in
an
equity
sentence.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
carson,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
you
on
one
point.
let's
assume
that
the
decree
worked
in
the
way
that
it
was
intended
to
work.
justice
abe
fortas
and
let's
assume
that
the
government
comes
in
and
demonstrates
that
working
in
that
intended
fashion,
the
decree
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose
of
this
that
it
was
intended
to
accomplish,
is
that
a
basis
for
reopening
the
decree
at
the
instance
of
the
government?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
judge
wyzanski's
standard,
he
says
--
as
i
understand
it,
he
made
a
distinction
between
situation
a
in
which
the
decree
had
not
worked
as
expected.
and
by
that,
i
assume
that
in
this
case,
it
would
mean
that
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
effectively
cease
the
leasing
practices
as
forbidden
by
the
decree.
the
situation
a,
if
the
decree
did
not
work
as
expected,
and
situation
b
working
as
expected,
it
did
not
accomplish
the
intended
results.
and
that
he
says
that
the
government
here
as
i
understand
him,
he
says
that
the
government
here
contends
that
the
decree
worked
as
it
was
intended
to
work
but
it
did
not
accomplish
the
desired
results
and
therefore,
judge
wyzanski
concluded
relief
is
barred
by
the
swift
decision.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
it
did
not.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
it
worked
as
foreseen
just
exactly
the
way
we're
supposed
to
work.
but
following
my
brother
white's
question,
suppose
it
worked
exactly
as
foreseen
but
for
some
reason
or
another
you
still
had
85%
of
the
market.
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
an
action
by
the
government
to
reopen
the
decree
allowed?
justice
abe
fortas
in
that
respect,
you
differ
from
judge
wyzanski
as
i
understand
it
if
you
take
a
look
at
his
opinion
on
page
82
of
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
may
be
wrong
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
here.
justice
abe
fortas
the
last
four
paragraph.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
asked
mr.
turner
whether
he
thought
we
have
before
as
the
issue
or
as
to
whether
judge
wyzanski
applied
the
proper
standard
or
whether
we
had
before
us
a
question
of
whether
applying
the
proper
standard
he
reached
the
right
resolve
and
as
i
understand
them.
mr.
turner
said
that
he
thought
the
question
was
whether
judge
wyzanski
did
apply
the
proper
standard.
as
i
read
his
opinion,
i
may
be
--
i
may
be
wrong.
as
i
read
his
opinion,
judge
wyzanski
said
that
in
this
case
the
decree,
the
government
is
complaining
that
the
decree
worked
as
intended
but
it
did
not
accomplish
the
result,
namely
the
dissipation
of
the
monopoly
without
refining
that.
now,
he
said
then
--
as
i
understand
judge
wyzanski,
he
said
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
a
legally
defensible
basis
for
reopening
a
decree.
and
i
assume
that
if
we
disagree
that
i'm
right
to
this
point
and
if
we
disagree
with
judge
wyzanski
in
whole
that
he
applied
the
wrong
standard,
then
we
would
remand
this.
the
competing
standard
is
of
course
that
even
if
the
decree
operated
as
intended
but
did
not
achieve
the
desired
result,
namely
the
dissipation
of
the
monopoly,
then
the
government
is
entitled
to
relief.
so
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
really
is
whether
this
is
a
question
that
before
us
the
standard
applied
by
judge
wyzanski
or
whether
we
have
before
us
a
question
of
--
that
goes
to
the
factual
results
accomplished
under
the
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
and
i
won't
butt
in
more,
mr.
carson.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
decree
says
--
the
decree
requires
accommodated
to
do
a,
b,
and
c
and
it's
a
monopoly
case,
and
then
let's
suppose
several
years
later,
the
government
comes
in
and
it
says
the
company
has
done
a,
b
and
c
but
it's
still
a
monopoly.
does
that
allegation
in
the
government's
petition
present
a
cause
of
action
or
complaint
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted
if
they
improve
it?
i
think
that's
my
question
really,
is
whether
that
is
a
kind
of
issue
we
have
before
us.
and
i
had
thought
frankly
that
it
was.
justice
abe
fortas
now
that
would
entitle
them
to
relief.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it
mr.
carson,
your
submission
is
that
we
ought
to
take
a
look
at
this
record
and
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
despite
what
you
suggest,
there's
judge
wyzanski's
error
of
law,
we
should
ourselves
decide
that
applying
the
correct
legal
standard,
there's
no
basis
for
reopening
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
you
said
all
the
time
if
given
the
opportunity,
you'd
show
this
and
that
and
the
other.
now
what
about
that
--
did
you
have
a
full
hearing?
did
you
tender
evidence
that
was
not
received?
was
this
a
front
patted
hearing
and
just
what
is
the
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
really
leads
me
confused
because
on
your
principal
argument,
i
thought
you
said
to
me
that
the
question
before
us
was
one
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
government
is
entitled
to
reopen
the
decree
but
now
you
tended
all
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
the
decree
had
failed
to
achieve
the
intended
result,
is
that
fair?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
judge
decided
or
did
the
judge
decide
that
you
had
failed
to
prove
that
the
decree
failed
to
--
that
the
decree
had
not
achieved
its
intended
result?
justice
abe
fortas
well
are
you
saying
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
erosion
didn't
go
fast
enough
or
that
the
decree
and
was
intended
to
operate
like
a
boat
from
blue
and
eliminate
the
bad
situation
in
one
stroke
or.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
i
have
a
great
difficulty
with
this.
i
rate
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
differently
in
a
very
likely
wrong.
i
read
judge
wyzanski
is
saying
that
the
issue
before
him
was,
did
the
decree
work
as
it
was
intended
to
work
as
distinguished
from
where
the
results
achieved
to
which
the
decree
was
directed.
in
other
words,
he
said
that
the
decree
commanded
united
shoe
to
do
a,
b
and
c.
united
shoe
did
a,
b
and
c
and
that
finishes
the
matter.
do
you
follow?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
he
says
that
the
government
urges
that
even
though
united
complied
with
the
decree
and
everything
worked
as
it
was
intended,
the
result
was
not
achieved
to
which
the
a,
b
and
c
were
directed
namely,
the
elimination
or
the
break
up
of
monopoly
power
and
judge
wyzanski
said
that
the
latter
whether
a
decree
achieved
that
objective
of
breaking
up
monopoly
power
is
not
a
matter
upon
which
the
government
can
now
get
relief.
you
don't
open
up
a
decree
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
whether
the
decree
was
wise
but
you
can
open
up
a
decree
only
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
wether
it
was
faithfully
carried
out.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
saying
something
very
different
and
that's
what
creating
my
difficulty
and
if
it
is
something
in
his
opinion
that
supports
your
construction
of
it
and
i'd
sure
like
to
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
judge
wyzanski
says
very
plainly
and
perhaps
very
bluntly,
the
government
is
now
coming
in
and
saying
that
a
decree
that
was
entered
in
1953
was
not
well
calculated
or
was
not
adequately
calculated
to
break
--
to
achieve
a
break
up
of
monopoly
power.
he
says,
that
is
not
a
subject
as
to
which
the
decree
can
be
reopened.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
it
is
a
subject
as
to
which
the
decree
can
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
if
that's
that
issue
i
can
understand
that.
whether
beyond
that,
i
am
having
greatest
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
crutch
of
the
problem
here
is
that
the
government
did
not
allege
or
claim
any
new
or
independent
violations
to
entrust

do

right
to
reopen
a
decree
in
a

--
in
decree
situations
and
on

that

i
don't

justice

fortas
if
that's
so
--

is
ten

justice

i

that

an
antirust
decree
sets
out
a
formula
for
the
company
within
a
particular
industry
to
operate
in
the
indefinite
future.
and
if
the
facts
demonstrate
that
at
some
time
the
decree
has
ceased
to
serve
the
purposes
of
the
law
which
was
intended
to
serve,
the
court
--
the
government
can
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
and
seek
a
modification
so
as
to
bring
the
decree
in
line
with
the
purposes
of
brand
new
practices
and
not
the
purposes
of
the
company.
but
what
time
has
to
do
with
that,
i
don't
see
at
the
moment
maybe
being
held.
justice
abe
fortas
no
because
you
might
see
it
as
a
suggestion
from
me
and
find
that
he's
not
a
member
of
the
board.
justice
abe
fortas
you've
now
moved
a
little
bit
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
different
from
taking
the
date
of
the
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
--
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
lectures
in
an
equity
sentence.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
carson,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
you
on
one
point.
let's
assume
that
the
decree
worked
in
the
way
that
it
was
intended
to
work.
justice
abe
fortas
and
let's
assume
that
the
government
comes
in
and
demonstrates
that
working
in
that
intended
fashion,
the
decree
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose
of
this
that
it
was
intended
to
accomplish,
is
that
a
basis
for
reopening
the
decree
at
the
instance
of
the
government?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
judge
wyzanski's
standard,
he
says
--
as
i
understand
it,
he
made
a
distinction
between
situation
a
in
which
the
decree
had
not
worked
as
expected.
and
by
that,
i
assume
that
in
this
case,
it
would
mean
that
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
effectively
cease
the
leasing
practices
as
forbidden
by
the
decree.
the
situation
a,
if
the
decree
did
not
work
as
expected,
and
situation
b
working
as
expected,
it
did
not
accomplish
the
intended
results.
and
that
he
says
that
the
government
here
as
i
understand
him,
he
says
that
the
government
here
contends
that
the
decree
worked
as
it
was
intended
to
work
but
it
did
not
accomplish
the
desired
results
and
therefore,
judge
wyzanski
concluded
relief
is
barred
by
the
swift
decision.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
it
did
not.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
it
worked
as
foreseen
just
exactly
the
way
we're
supposed
to
work.
but
following
my
brother
white's
question,
suppose
it
worked
exactly
as
foreseen
but
for
some
reason
or
another
you
still
had
85%
of
the
market.
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
an
action
by
the
government
to
reopen
the
decree
allowed?
justice
abe
fortas
in
that
respect,
you
differ
from
judge
wyzanski
as
i
understand
it
if
you
take
a
look
at
his
opinion
on
page
82
of
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
may
be
wrong
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
here.
justice
abe
fortas
the
last
four
paragraph.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
asked
mr.
turner
whether
he
thought
we
have
before
as
the
issue
or
as
to
whether
judge
wyzanski
applied
the
proper
standard
or
whether
we
had
before
us
a
question
of
whether
applying
the
proper
standard
he
reached
the
right
resolve
and
as
i
understand
them.
mr.
turner
said
that
he
thought
the
question
was
whether
judge
wyzanski
did
apply
the
proper
standard.
as
i
read
his
opinion,
i
may
be
--
i
may
be
wrong.
as
i
read
his
opinion,
judge
wyzanski
said
that
in
this
case
the
decree,
the
government
is
complaining
that
the
decree
worked
as
intended
but
it
did
not
accomplish
the
result,
namely
the
dissipation
of
the
monopoly
without
refining
that.
now,
he
said
then
--
as
i
understand
judge
wyzanski,
he
said
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
a
legally
defensible
basis
for
reopening
a
decree.
and
i
assume
that
if
we
disagree
that
i'm
right
to
this
point
and
if
we
disagree
with
judge
wyzanski
in
whole
that
he
applied
the
wrong
standard,
then
we
would
remand
this.
the
competing
standard
is
of
course
that
even
if
the
decree
operated
as
intended
but
did
not
achieve
the
desired
result,
namely
the
dissipation
of
the
monopoly,
then
the
government
is
entitled
to
relief.
so
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
really
is
whether
this
is
a
question
that
before
us
the
standard
applied
by
judge
wyzanski
or
whether
we
have
before
us
a
question
of
--
that
goes
to
the
factual
results
accomplished
under
the
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
and
i
won't
butt
in
more,
mr.
carson.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
decree
says
--
the
decree
requires
accommodated
to
do
a,
b,
and
c
and
it's
a
monopoly
case,
and
then
let's
suppose
several
years
later,
the
government
comes
in
and
it
says
the
company
has
done
a,
b
and
c
but
it's
still
a
monopoly.
does
that
allegation
in
the
government's
petition
present
a
cause
of
action
or
complaint
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted
if
they
improve
it?
i
think
that's
my
question
really,
is
whether
that
is
a
kind
of
issue
we
have
before
us.
and
i
had
thought
frankly
that
it
was.
justice
abe
fortas
now
that
would
entitle
them
to
relief.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it
mr.
carson,
your
submission
is
that
we
ought
to
take
a
look
at
this
record
and
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
despite
what
you
suggest,
there's
judge
wyzanski's
error
of
law,
we
should
ourselves
decide
that
applying
the
correct
legal
standard,
there's
no
basis
for
reopening
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
you
said
all
the
time
if
given
the
opportunity,
you'd
show
this
and
that
and
the
other.
now
what
about
that
--
did
you
have
a
full
hearing?
did
you
tender
evidence
that
was
not
received?
was
this
a
front
patted
hearing
and
just
what
is
the
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
really
leads
me
confused
because
on
your
principal
argument,
i
thought
you
said
to
me
that
the
question
before
us
was
one
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
government
is
entitled
to
reopen
the
decree
but
now
you
tended
all
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
the
decree
had
failed
to
achieve
the
intended
result,
is
that
fair?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
judge
decided
or
did
the
judge
decide
that
you
had
failed
to
prove
that
the
decree
failed
to
--
that
the
decree
had
not
achieved
its
intended
result?
justice
abe
fortas
well
are
you
saying
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
erosion
didn't
go
fast
enough
or
that
the
decree
and
was
intended
to
operate
like
a
boat
from
blue
and
eliminate
the
bad
situation
in
one
stroke
or.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
i
have
a
great
difficulty
with
this.
i
rate
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
differently
in
a
very
likely
wrong.
i
read
judge
wyzanski
is
saying
that
the
issue
before
him
was,
did
the
decree
work
as
it
was
intended
to
work
as
distinguished
from
where
the
results
achieved
to
which
the
decree
was
directed.
in
other
words,
he
said
that
the
decree
commanded
united
shoe
to
do
a,
b
and
c.
united
shoe
did
a,
b
and
c
and
that
finishes
the
matter.
do
you
follow?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
he
says
that
the
government
urges
that
even
though
united
complied
with
the
decree
and
everything
worked
as
it
was
intended,
the
result
was
not
achieved
to
which
the
a,
b
and
c
were
directed
namely,
the
elimination
or
the
break
up
of
monopoly
power
and
judge
wyzanski
said
that
the
latter
whether
a
decree
achieved
that
objective
of
breaking
up
monopoly
power
is
not
a
matter
upon
which
the
government
can
now
get
relief.
you
don't
open
up
a
decree
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
whether
the
decree
was
wise
but
you
can
open
up
a
decree
only
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
wether
it
was
faithfully
carried
out.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
saying
something
very
different
and
that's
what
creating
my
difficulty
and
if
it
is
something
in
his
opinion
that
supports
your
construction
of
it
and
i'd
sure
like
to
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
judge
wyzanski
says
very
plainly
and
perhaps
very
bluntly,
the
government
is
now
coming
in
and
saying
that
a
decree
that
was
entered
in
1953
was
not
well
calculated
or
was
not
adequately
calculated
to
break
--
to
achieve
a
break
up
of
monopoly
power.
he
says,
that
is
not
a
subject
as
to
which
the
decree
can
be
reopened.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
it
is
a
subject
as
to
which
the
decree
can
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
if
that's
that
issue
i
can
understand
that.
whether
beyond
that,
i
am
having
greatest
--
