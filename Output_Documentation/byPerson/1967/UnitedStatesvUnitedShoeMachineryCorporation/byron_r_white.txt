justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
--
you're
just
--
you
say
this
is
simply
and
only
a
matter
of
remedy
under
the
old
--
to
meet
the
old
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
is
no
new
violation,
you
must
say,
that
--
you
must
be
saying
there's
no
monopolization
that's
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
found
that
the
company
operating
in
the
market
in
some
industry
such
as
united
with
that
kind
of
power
and
doing
it
precisely
what
it's
doing
now
and
under
the
same
voluntarily
established
rules,
you
would
not
attack
it
as
violating
section
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
turner.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
this
may
be
all
theory,
it
may
not
be.
the
day
after
the
decree
was
entered
and
it
became
effective
in
the
united,
it
started
off
bringing
under
it,
i
gather
you
say
it
was
not
monopolizing
at
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
person
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
a
person
with
monopoly
power
and
all
the
purpose
necessary
can
still
operate
his
business
then,
sell
his
goods
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
isn't
monopolization?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
do
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
that?
do
you
have
anything
further?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
prices?
can
it
be
--
can
you
--
could
you
be
--
first
with
monopoly
power,
not
doing
anything
but
selling
at
certain
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
monopolizing?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
what
about
selling
it
an
unreasonably
high
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
could
ever
be
determined?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
but
selling
at
a
high
enough
price
i
suppose
could
have
knocked
the
monopolization
if
you
had
the
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
for
your
customers,
they
might
have
some
problem
with
the
--
with
the
two
high
prices
because
your
competitor's
prices
were
too
low.
it
might
be
monopolization.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
market
power
hadn't
gone
down
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
power,
the
share
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
would
think
that
the
aim
of
the
decree
is
not
only
in
monopolization
but
monopoly
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
decree
necessarily
--
as
long
as
someone
can
say
that
there's
no
monopolization
--
well,
if
there
is
no
monopolization
after
the
decree
has
entered,
do
you
suggest
it
must
do
more
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
the
monopoly
power
doesn't
decline,
there
really
is
monopolization?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
otherwise
--
there
must
be
something
going
on
that's
exclusive
where
competition
would
erode
this
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
suppose
it's
one
thing
to
argue
that
--
if
you
assume
the
decree
is
supposed
to
dissipate
monopoly
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
i
suppose
you
make
one
kind
of
argument
as
to
whether
it's
been
dissipated
when
you
get
to
70
to
62%.
it's
something
else
again
if
you
say
that
monopoly
power
need
be
dissipated
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
that
would
be
true
as
long
as
he
accepted
the
government's
view
that
there
wasn't
any
monopolization.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
of
competitors,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
customers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
i
take
it
that
if
all
the
people
have
an
option
to
buy
machine
under
the
decree
had
bought
them,
i
suppose
there
would
have
been
less
revenue
in
‘63?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
because
these
are
new
leases
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
all
the
machines
in
‘63
on
which
rental
was
being
received
where
machines
which
have
been
leased
since
the
decree
was
entered.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
nevertheless,
if
people
who
had
--
everyone
had
a
right
to
buy
the
machines
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
are
on
lease.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
was
transactions
among
those
63
in
that
revenues
because
the
buyers
had
bought
because
the
lessees
haven't
decided
to
buy.
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
government
never
suggested
that
the
measures
of
the
district
court
adopt
to
dissipate
monopoly
power
have
not
produced
their
maximum
effects
and
that
they
were
producing
effects.
they
just
said
to
their
other
-
these
effects
are
adequate
and
we
should
consider
additional
remedies
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
they
wanted
to
go
into
the
additional
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
accept
the
trial
judges
statement
that
this
decree
is
producing
precisely
with
the
results
it
was
expected
to
produce
and
then
swift
becomes
very
relevant
namely
should
there
--
should
you
now
attempt
to
produce
some
results
other
than
what
was
originally
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence,
the
swift
standard
would
become
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
would
suggest
--
you
would
not
suggest
that
the
previous
proceedings
in
this
case
that
if
you
found
--
if
in
the
first
instance
found
united
with
62%
and
its
nearest
competitor
is
7%
or
8%
or
9%
that
you
could
successfully
urge
with
united
be
dissolved
or
separated.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
admittedly
not
now
offering
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
acquired.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
--
are
there
any
mergers
who
put
in
the
--
among
the
competitors
of
united
or
you
take
it
in
view
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
--
the
government
would
then
certainly
be
a
subject
to
some
heavier
burdens
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
proceedings
such
as
swift.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
he
did
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
--
you're
just
--
you
say
this
is
simply
and
only
a

of

justice

okay.

well
mr.

can
i
ask

this

and
that

justice

he
has
to

something

justice

and
what
is
that?
do
you
have
anything
further?
justice
byron

how
about

can

can

could

or
a
low

justice
byron

white
thank
you.
justice
byron

well,
what
about

what
about
selling
it
an
unreasonably

price?
justice

if

could

that

high
enough
price
i
suppose
could
have
knocked
the

if

had
the
power.
justice

as
for
your
customers,
they
might
have
some
problem
with
the
--
with
the
two
high
prices
because
your
competitor's
prices
were
too
low.
it
might
be
monopolization.
justice

yes.
justice
byron

well,
what
if

what
