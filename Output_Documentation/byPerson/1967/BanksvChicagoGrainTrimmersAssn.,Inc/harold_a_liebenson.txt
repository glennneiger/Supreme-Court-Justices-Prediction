mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
may
it
please
your
honor
and
justices.
i
believe
that
we
have
to
start
a
little
bit
with
the
facts
in
this
case
because
of
the
unusual
situation.
you
have
an
occurrence
that
took
place
on
january
26
in
1961
where
a
man
was
injured
at
a
gateway
elevator
company
where
there
were
no
eyewitnesses,
where
the
time
was
unknown,
where
he
was
working
as
a
button
man
and
his
type
of
work
and
he
was
allegedly
struck
on
the
forehead
with
some
steel,
but
no
one
saw
this
and
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
it.
the
only
thing
there
was
in
the
record
was
a
statement
that
there
was
a
little
tiny
black
mark
on
his
forehead.
this
particular
case
came
to
trial
before
the
longshoremen
commissioner
and
on
the
evidence,
he
made
a
finding
that
there’s
no
evidence
of
this
man
being
injured
on
january
26th
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
thereafter
i
happen
to
get
in
the
case
and
i
heard
about
another
occurrence
which
took
place
on
january
30th
1961.
now
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
on
january
30th
about
two
hours
after
this
occurrence,
the
man
came
home
and
from
the
top
of
his
steps
suddenly
catapulted
from
the
top
of
the
steps
to
the
basement
no
evidence
of
tripping
and
no
evidence
of
the
man
protecting
himself,
in
other
words
his
hands
his
hands
didn't
go
forward
or
anything
to
do
anything
to,
for
self-protection.
now,
when
this
man
fell,
he
remained
unconscious
till
his
death
on
february
12.
when
the
case
came
to
trial
at
the
first
hearing,
the
respondent
had
in
its
possession
a
statement
from
an
eyewitness
to
the
occurrence
of
january
30th,
but
this
was
not
made
known
and
you
now
have
a
widow
bringing
the
action,
not
a
person
who
was
injured
and
alive
and
who
can
tell
about
it.
on
january
30th,
i'm
sorry
let
me
go
back.
subsequent
to
this,
i
filed
a
--
i
heard
about
the
witness
and
i
filed
a
lawsuit
a
third
party
action
in
the
federal
court
and
i
subpoenaed
the
insurance
company
record
and
i
obtained
a
copy
of
the
statement
that
they
had.
now,
the
statement
was
dated
on
april
8,
1961,
the
hearing
on
this
first
occurrence
was
on
january
26,
1961.
at
no
time
during
this
january
26,
1961
hearing
is
there
anything
about
an
occurrence
that
took
place
on
january
30.
now
the
occurrence
that
took
place
at
january
30th
took
place
at
another
elevator,
a
distance
away.
it
was
--
the
man
was
doing
a
different
type
of
work.
he
was
--
there
was
an
eyewitness
who
saw
this
and
saw
that
he
--
wherein
he
was
hit
on
the
top
of
the
head
from
approximately
30
pounds
of
rope
that
fell
about
50
feet
and
the
man
was
seen
rubbing
his
head.
now,
this
case
after
it
was
tried
in
the
federal
court,
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
in
our
favor
for
the
maximum
which
was
$30,000
and
subsequent
thereto
the
trial
judge
entered
an
order
of
remittitur
of
$11,000.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
stepped
out
of
the
case
basically
because
the
government
took
over
at
that
time,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
first
occurrence
was
res
judicata
of
the
second
occurrence
and
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
was
number
one,
they
cite
the
baltimore
versus
phillips,
a
steamship
case
at
274
u.s.
wherein
the,
there
is
no
comparison
as
to
the
facts.
in
that
particular
case
there
was
a
sailor
who
sued
under
the
admiralty
act
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
then
after
there
was
a
verdict
in
that
case
then
he
went
to
another
court
and
brought
another
action
under
the
jones
act
case
and
the
court
probably
said,
well
your
rights
were
determined
in
this
first
hearing.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
cover
that
later
on
too.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
it's
about
70,000,
i
think
in
this
proceeding
total.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
mean
i
think
that
would
be
the
ultimate.
now,
so
then
the
other
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
gives
is
that
section
22
is
not
applicable
and
they
say
the
reason
it's
not
applicable
because
there
was
at
no
time
was
there
a
disputing
of
the
findings
of
fact
within
the
30
days
under
section
921
and
they
cite
the
case
of
flamm
versus
hughes
329
f.2d
378
and
that
case
is
not
in
point.
that
was
a
case
where
they
were
testing
the
constitutionality
of
the
section,
where
--
section
921,
where
there
was
n
change
in
conditions
and
there
was
no
additional
evidence,
that
counsel
in
his
brief
doesn't
rely
on
the
case
of
flamm
versus
hughes
or
doesn't
cite
that,
cite
it.
whereas
on
page
14
of
our
brief
we
cite
about
five
or
six
cases
which
clearly
holds
that
section
22
does
apply
in
--
after
30
days.
the
other
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
gives
is
that
section
22
doesn't
apply
because
the
deputy
commissioner
was
not
aware
of
the
january
30th
accident
until
more
than
one
year
after
the
rejection
of
the
claim
and
this
was
clearly
erroneous
because
on
the
record
it
shows
that
the
second
claim
was
filed
one
and
a
half
months
after
the
occurrence.
so
we
have
all
three
basis
of
the
court
incorrect
in
our
opinion.
our
contention
here
is
that
section
22
precludes
the
doctrine
of
the
defense
of
res
judicata
during
the
year
following
a
decision
of
a
deputy
commissioner.
i
think
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
act,
that
was
a
purpose
that
it
was
put
into
it,
that
was
a
purpose
that
they
amended
the
act
and
our
reading
the
act
makes
it
very
clear.
after
all
you're
dealing
with
people
who
have
come
before
a
person
who
is
in
most
instances
not
a
lawyer.
they
have
no
discovery
procedure.
they
try
to
make
it
as
simple
as
possible
although
i
do
believe
that
discovery
procedure
should
be
permitted
in
this
type
of
a
case
and
the
counsel
contends
that
there
is
discovery
procedure,
but
i
can't
see
it
because
the
way
the
statute
is
worded,
they're
talking
about
testimony
and
this
is
very
similar
to
the
case
i
had
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
minor
versus
atlas
where
this
court
held
that
a
local
rule
which
allowed
discovery
procedure
was
unconstitutional
because
there
was
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
it
and
the
words
almost
similar.
what
they're
talking
about
is
testimony,
the
power
to
take
testimony
of
a
deputy
commissioner
and
not
to
make
--
have
interrogatories
or
to
have
adverse
witness
procedure.
i
hope
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir
and
this
widow
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
now
the
other,
the
other
phase
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
my
contention
is
that
there
are
two
separate
causes
of
action
and
one
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
no
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
--
with
due
respect
this
kind
of
argument
was
submitted
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now
what
they
are
saying
is
that
because
a
man
died,
there
is
only
one
cause
of
action
but
that
to
me
is
like
saying
that
when
this
court
refuses
to
grant
certiorari
that
this
case
has
been
decided
by
this
court
because
your
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
because
of
this
reasoning;
in
number
one
instance
the
man
had
a
separate
cause
of
action
going
on
january
26.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
where
he
was
allegedly
hurt
but
there
was
no
proof
of
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
at
january
26th.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
by
a
piece
of
chain.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
because
you
have
two
separate
incidents.
now
that
doesn't
mean
you
can
recover
for
both
of
them
and
nor
did
she
recover
in
this
instance
on
both
causes
of
action.
she
only
recovered
on
one.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir,
but
i
had
answer
his
questions.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
of
section
22
no,
no.
well
i
just
happen
to
believe
in
this
discovery
procedure.
now
on
this
we
also
have
a
statute
which
is
section
22
which
clearly
gives
the
deputy
commissioner
the
right
to
change
his
ruling
upon
any
change
of
conditions
and
these
change
of
conditions
were
brought
out.
the
deputy
commissioner
knew
of
the
prior
occurrence.
it
was
the
same
deputy
commissioner.
the
deputy
commissioner
knew
that
the
other
side
or
the
respondent
had
filed
a
petition
or
alleging
res
judicata
and
he
knew
the
position
of
parties
when
he
heard
the
second
case.
it
is
also
our
contention
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
doesn't
apply
and
we
contend
because
they
withheld
this
information
pursuant
to
section
30
of
the
act
which
was
--
where
they
did
not
file
a
form
202.
now
the
general
procedure
when
a
form
202
is
filed
you
have
a
what
is
called
as
a
pretrial
hearing
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
you
go
over
the
particular
part
or
if
no
claim
is
filed,
it
is
to
the
general
procedure
of
the
deputy
commissioner's
office
to
notify
people
saying
well
are
you
going
to
make
a
claim
under
this
act
in
order
to
protect
the
injured
workers.
now,
our
position
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
isn't
applicable
on
the
--
aside
from
statute
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
that's
supposed
--
that's
under
the
section
30.
it's
supposed
to
tell
the
date
the
time
and
the
place
of
the
occurrence
and
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
within
page
15
of
our
brief
it
set
forth
within
10
days
from
the
date
of
any
injury
or
death
or
from
the
date
that
the
employer
has
knowledge
of
a
disease
or
infection
and
so
forth,
he
should
give
the
name,
address
and
business
of
the
employer,
the
name,
address,
occupation
of
the
employer,
the
cause
and
the
nature
of
the
injury
and
so
forth.
now
they
didn't
file
a
form
30.
they
withheld
the
name
of
the
witness
or
any
information
pertaining
to
an
accident
of
30th.
at
no
time
did
the
deputy
commissioner
hear
any
questions
pertaining
to
the
30th.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
actually
what
had
happened
was
some
time
afterward,
the
referring
attorney
came
to
me
and
said
i
heard
there
is
a
witness
and
we
just
went
out
and
investigated
and
located
a
particular
man
who
is
not
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
that's
how
we
found
about
it
that
he
said,
oh
i
gave
the
statement
to
them
a
long
time
ago.
they
came
out
and
they
interviewed
me.
the
--
there
is
one
interesting
article
on
res
judicata
and
claim
peculation
by
professor
vesto
in
north
western
university
law
review
volume
62
number
3
which
sort
of
covers
the
subject
very
thoroughly,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
that
basically
this
all
comes
down
to
certain
questions.
was
there
a
trial
at
the
first
hearing
which
related
to
the
january
30th
occurrence
and
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
was
there
any
testimony
of
the
january,
at
the
january
26th
occurrence
hearing
pertaining
to
the
30th
that
would
be
no.
and
was
the
occurrence
of
january
30th
1961
an
issue
or
litigated
or
determined
and
there
was
no
issue
cited
in
this
particular
case
or
decided
in
this
case
about
the
january
30th
occurrence.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir
i'm
saying
that
pick
up,
number
one
--
number
section
22
under
--
because
of
section
22
there
is
no
res
judicata
and
if
otherwise
i
also
say
there
is
still
isn't
res
judicata
because
they
withheld
the
certain
information
that
was
all
within
their
control
and
they
didn't
divulge
it.
there
is
one
another
point
i
think
should
be
covered
and
this
is
the
question
of
the
remittitur.
counsel
contends
that
because
we
accepted
a
remittitur
of
$11000
ordered
by
the
court
that
this
was
a
compromise
on
our
part
and
therefore
we
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
recover.
the
--
i
think
i
should
explain
to
the
court
that
after
the
verdict,
when
the
judge
entered
the
remittitur
or
said
he
would
enter
a
remittitur
of
$11000
or
grant
a
new
trial,
i
was
faced
with
the
position
at
that
time
of
deciding
whether
we
should
accept
the
remittitur
or
appeal.
if
we
appealed
this
case
the
only
person
who
would
gain
by
the
appeal
would
be
the
attorney
or
myself
because
if
successful
on
the
appeal
i
would
get
a
larger
fee,
whereas
if
i
didn't
appeal,
i
still
had
a
record
of
a
jury
verdict
holding
that
on
the
30th
of
january
this
man
was
killed
as
a
result
of
being
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
and
the
other
side
would
be
entitled
to
the
credit
anyway.
so
that
my
people
by
accepting
$19000
did
not
lose
anything
because
the
other
side
would
get
the
credit.
in
other
words
if
i
am
entitled
to
70,000
in
the
court
of
--
at
the
longshoremen
commission
and
i
accept
19,000
i
am
still
entitled
to
the
balance
of
$51,000
whereas
if
i
appealed
it
and
got
the
verdict
reinstated
to
30
all
i
would
do
is
be
getting
--
my
people
would
still
end
up
with
the
same
amount
of
money
but
i
would
be
getting
a
fee
and
i
thought
i
would
be
criticized
for
it
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
take
that
appeal.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'd
like
--
that
would
interesting.
i
did,
i
don't
feel
it
would
be
because
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
was
against
the
norris
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
would
like
to
apply
that
as
an
estoppal
but
i
actually
felt
that
as
long
as
--
frankly
as
long
as
the
jury
came
in
and
i
figured
that
so
would
the
deputy
commissioner
go
along
and
give
him
an
award.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
this
is
what
happened
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
they
just
stopped,
they
went
to
res
judicata
and
stopped.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
before
them,
but
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
and
we
bring
it
out
in
our
brief
the
question
we
ask
is
whether
or
not
a
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
because
we
briefed
all
the
other
issues
in
the
case
as
part
of
this
case.
in
other
words
all
issues
that
are
presented
are
before
this
court.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir
except
in
the
case
cited
by
counsel,
there
i
find
no
other
case
other
than
one
where
there
was
a
consent
directed
verdict
by
counsel,
that
is
cited
by
counsel,
but
no
other
case
that
i
could
find.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
been
decided.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir
other
than
what's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
we
have
just
a
few
cases
and
those
are
based
on
the
new
york
case.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
there
is
nothing
further
i
think
i
have
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
may
it
please
your
honor
and
justices.
i
believe
that
we
have
to
start
a
little
bit
with
the
facts
in
this
case
because
of
the
unusual
situation.
you
have
an
occurrence
that
took
place
on
january
26
in
1961
where
a
man
was
injured
at
a
gateway
elevator
company
where
there
were
no
eyewitnesses,
where
the
time
was
unknown,
where
he
was
working
as
a
button
man
and
his
type
of
work
and
he
was
allegedly
struck
on
the
forehead
with
some
steel,
but
no
one
saw
this
and
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
it.
the
only
thing
there
was
in
the
record
was
a
statement
that
there
was
a
little
tiny
black
mark
on
his
forehead.
this
particular
case
came
to
trial
before
the
longshoremen
commissioner
and
on
the
evidence,
he
made
a
finding
that
there’s
no
evidence
of
this
man
being
injured
on
january
26th
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
thereafter
i
happen
to
get
in
the
case
and
i
heard
about
another
occurrence
which
took
place
on
january
30th
1961.
now
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
on
january
30th
about
two
hours
after
this
occurrence,
the
man
came
home
and
from
the
top
of
his
steps
suddenly
catapulted
from
the
top
of
the
steps
to
the
basement
no
evidence
of
tripping
and
no
evidence
of
the
man
protecting
himself,
in
other
words
his
hands
his
hands
didn't
go
forward
or
anything
to
do
anything
to,
for
self-protection.
now,
when
this
man
fell,
he
remained
unconscious
till
his
death
on
february
12.
when
the
case
came
to
trial
at
the
first
hearing,
the
respondent
had
in
its
possession
a
statement
from
an
eyewitness
to
the
occurrence
of
january
30th,
but
this
was
not
made
known
and
you
now
have
a
widow
bringing
the
action,
not
a
person
who
was
injured
and
alive
and
who
can
tell
about
it.
on
january
30th,
i'm
sorry
let
me
go
back.
subsequent
to
this,
i
filed
a
--
i
heard
about
the
witness
and
i
filed
a
lawsuit
a
third
party
action
in
the
federal
court
and
i
subpoenaed
the
insurance
company
record
and
i
obtained
a
copy
of
the
statement
that
they
had.
now,
the
statement
was
dated
on
april
8,
1961,
the
hearing
on
this
first
occurrence
was
on
january
26,
1961.
at
no
time
during
this
january
26,
1961
hearing
is
there
anything
about
an
occurrence
that
took
place
on
january
30.
now
the
occurrence
that
took
place
at
january
30th
took
place
at
another
elevator,
a
distance
away.
it
was
--
the
man
was
doing
a
different
type
of
work.
he
was
--
there
was
an
eyewitness
who
saw
this
and
saw
that
he
--
wherein
he
was
hit
on
the
top
of
the
head
from
approximately
30
pounds
of
rope
that
fell
about
50
feet
and
the
man
was
seen
rubbing
his
head.
now,
this
case
after
it
was
tried
in
the
federal
court,
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
in
our
favor
for
the
maximum
which
was
$30,000
and
subsequent
thereto
the
trial
judge
entered
an
order
of
remittitur
of
$11,000.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
stepped
out
of
the
case
basically
because
the
government
took
over
at
that
time,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
first
occurrence
was
res
judicata
of
the
second
occurrence
and
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
was
number
one,
they
cite
the
baltimore
versus
phillips,
a
steamship
case
at
274
u.s.
wherein
the,
there
is
no
comparison
as
to
the
facts.
in
that
particular
case
there
was
a
sailor
who
sued
under
the
admiralty
act
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
then
after
there
was
a
verdict
in
that
case
then
he
went
to
another
court
and
brought
another
action
under
the
jones
act
case
and
the
court
probably
said,
well
your
rights
were
determined
in
this
first
hearing.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
cover
that
later
on
too.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
it's
about
70,000,
i
think
in
this
proceeding
total.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
mean
i
think
that
would
be
the
ultimate.
now,
so
then
the
other
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
gives
is
that
section
22
is
not
applicable
and
they
say
the
reason
it's
not
applicable
because
there
was
at
no
time
was
there
a
disputing
of
the
findings
of
fact
within
the
30
days
under
section
921
and
they
cite
the
case
of
flamm
versus
hughes
329
f.2d
378
and
that
case
is
not
in
point.
that
was
a
case
where
they
were
testing
the
constitutionality
of
the
section,
where
--
section
921,
where
there
was
n
change
in
conditions
and
there
was
no
additional
evidence,
that
counsel
in
his
brief
doesn't
rely
on
the
case
of
flamm
versus
hughes
or
doesn't
cite
that,
cite
it.
whereas
on
page
14
of
our
brief
we
cite
about
five
or
six
cases
which
clearly
holds
that
section
22
does
apply
in
--
after
30
days.
the
other
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
gives
is
that
section
22
doesn't
apply
because
the
deputy
commissioner
was
not
aware
of
the
january
30th
accident
until
more
than
one
year
after
the
rejection
of
the
claim
and
this
was
clearly
erroneous
because
on
the
record
it
shows
that
the
second
claim
was
filed
one
and
a
half
months
after
the
occurrence.
so
we
have
all
three
basis
of
the
court
incorrect
in
our
opinion.
our
contention
here
is
that
section
22
precludes
the
doctrine
of
the
defense
of
res
judicata
during
the
year
following
a
decision
of
a
deputy
commissioner.
i
think
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
act,
that
was
a
purpose
that
it
was
put
into
it,
that
was
a
purpose
that
they
amended
the
act
and
our
reading
the
act
makes
it
very
clear.
after
all
you're
dealing
with
people
who
have
come
before
a
person
who
is
in
most
instances
not
a
lawyer.
they
have
no
discovery
procedure.
they
try
to
make
it
as
simple
as
possible
although
i
do
believe
that
discovery
procedure
should
be
permitted
in
this
type
of
a
case
and
the
counsel
contends
that
there
is
discovery
procedure,
but
i
can't
see
it
because
the
way
the
statute
is
worded,
they're
talking
about
testimony
and
this
is
very
similar
to
the
case
i
had
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
minor
versus
atlas
where
this
court
held
that
a
local
rule
which
allowed
discovery
procedure
was
unconstitutional
because
there
was
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
it
and
the
words
almost
similar.
what
they're
talking
about
is
testimony,
the
power
to
take
testimony
of
a
deputy
commissioner
and
not
to
make
--
have
interrogatories
or
to
have
adverse
witness
procedure.
i
hope
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir
and
this
widow
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
now
the
other,
the
other
phase
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
my
contention
is
that
there
are
two
separate
causes
of
action
and
one
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
no
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
--
with
due
respect
this
kind
of
argument
was
submitted
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now
what
they
are
saying
is
that
because
a
man
died,
there
is
only
one
cause
of
action
but
that
to
me
is
like
saying
that
when
this
court
refuses
to
grant
certiorari
that
this
case
has
been
decided
by
this
court
because
your
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
because
of
this
reasoning;
in
number
one
instance
the
man
had
a
separate
cause
of
action
going
on
january
26.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
where
he
was
allegedly
hurt
but
there
was
no
proof
of
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
at
january
26th.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
by
a
piece
of
chain.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
because
you
have
two
separate
incidents.
now
that
doesn't
mean
you
can
recover
for
both
of
them
and
nor
did
she
recover
in
this
instance
on
both
causes
of
action.
she
only
recovered
on
one.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir,
but
i
had
answer
his
questions.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
of
section
22
no,
no.
well
i
just
happen
to
believe
in
this
discovery
procedure.
now
on
this
we
also
have
a
statute
which
is
section
22
which
clearly
gives
the
deputy
commissioner
the
right
to
change
his
ruling
upon
any
change
of
conditions
and
these
change
of
conditions
were
brought
out.
the
deputy
commissioner
knew
of
the
prior
occurrence.
it
was
the
same
deputy
commissioner.
the
deputy
commissioner
knew
that
the
other
side
or
the
respondent
had
filed
a
petition
or
alleging
res
judicata
and
he
knew
the
position
of
parties
when
he
heard
the
second
case.
it
is
also
our
contention
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
doesn't
apply
and
we
contend
because
they
withheld
this
information
pursuant
to
section
30
of
the
act
which
was
--
where
they
did
not
file
a
form
202.
now
the
general
procedure
when
a
form
202
is
filed
you
have
a
what
is
called
as
a
pretrial
hearing
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
you
go
over
the
particular
part
or
if
no
claim
is
filed,
it
is
to
the
general
procedure
of
the
deputy
commissioner's
office
to
notify
people
saying
well
are
you
going
to
make
a
claim
under
this
act
in
order
to
protect
the
injured
workers.
now,
our
position
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
isn't
applicable
on
the
--
aside
from
statute
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
that's
supposed
--
that's
under
the
section
30.
it's
supposed
to
tell
the
date
the
time
and
the
place
of
the
occurrence
and
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
within
page
15
of
our
brief
it
set
forth
within
10
days
from
the
date
of
any
injury
or
death
or
from
the
date
that
the
employer
has
knowledge
of
a
disease
or
infection
and
so
forth,
he
should
give
the
name,
address
and
business
of
the
employer,
the
name,
address,
occupation
of
the
employer,
the
cause
and
the
nature
of
the
injury
and
so
forth.
now
they
didn't
file
a
form
30.
they
withheld
the
name
of
the
witness
or
any
information
pertaining
to
an
accident
of
30th.
at
no
time
did
the
deputy
commissioner
hear
any
questions
pertaining
to
the
30th.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
actually
what
had
happened
was
some
time
afterward,
the
referring
attorney
came
to
me
and
said
i
heard
there
is
a
witness
and
we
just
went
out
and
investigated
and
located
a
particular
man
who
is
not
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
that's
how
we
found
about
it
that
he
said,
oh
i
gave
the
statement
to
them
a
long
time
ago.
they
came
out
and
they
interviewed
me.
the
--
there
is
one
interesting
article
on
res
judicata
and
claim
peculation
by
professor
vesto
in
north
western
university
law
review
volume
62
number
3
which
sort
of
covers
the
subject
very
thoroughly,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
that
basically
this
all
comes
down
to
certain
questions.
was
there
a
trial
at
the
first
hearing
which
related
to
the
january
30th
occurrence
and
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
was
there
any
testimony
of
the
january,
at
the
january
26th
occurrence
hearing
pertaining
to
the
30th
that
would
be
no.
and
was
the
occurrence
of
january
30th
1961
an
issue
or
litigated
or
determined
and
there
was
no
issue
cited
in
this
particular
case
or
decided
in
this
case
about
the
january
30th
occurrence.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir
i'm
saying
that
pick
up,
number
one
--
number
section
22
under
--
because
of
section
22
there
is
no
res
judicata
and
if
otherwise
i
also
say
there
is
still
isn't
res
judicata
because
they
withheld
the
certain
information
that
was
all
within
their
control
and
they
didn't
divulge
it.
there
is
one
another
point
i
think
should
be
covered
and
this
is
the
question
of
the
remittitur.
counsel
contends
that
because
we
accepted
a
remittitur
of
$11000
ordered
by
the
court
that
this
was
a
compromise
on
our
part
and
therefore
we
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
recover.
the
--
i
think
i
should
explain
to
the
court
that
after
the
verdict,
when
the
judge
entered
the
remittitur
or
said
he
would
enter
a
remittitur
of
$11000
or
grant
a
new
trial,
i
was
faced
with
the
position
at
that
time
of
deciding
whether
we
should
accept
the
remittitur
or
appeal.
if
we
appealed
this
case
the
only
person
who
would
gain
by
the
appeal
would
be
the
attorney
or
myself
because
if
successful
on
the
appeal
i
would
get
a
larger
fee,
whereas
if
i
didn't
appeal,
i
still
had
a
record
of
a
jury
verdict
holding
that
on
the
30th
of
january
this
man
was
killed
as
a
result
of
being
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
and
the
other
side
would
be
entitled
to
the
credit
anyway.
so
that
my
people
by
accepting
$19000
did
not
lose
anything
because
the
other
side
would
get
the
credit.
in
other
words
if
i
am
entitled
to
70,000
in
the
court
of
--
at
the
longshoremen
commission
and
i
accept
19,000
i
am
still
entitled
to
the
balance
of
$51,000
whereas
if
i
appealed
it
and
got
the
verdict
reinstated
to
30
all
i
would
do
is
be
getting
--
my
people
would
still
end
up
with
the
same
amount
of
money
but
i
would
be
getting
a
fee
and
i
thought
i
would
be
criticized
for
it
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
take
that
appeal.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'd
like
--
that
would
interesting.
i
did,
i
don't
feel
it
would
be
because
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
was
against
the
norris
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
would
like
to
apply
that
as
an
estoppal
but
i
actually
felt
that
as
long
as
--
frankly
as
long
as
the
jury
came
in
and
i
figured
that
so
would
the
deputy
commissioner
go
along
and
give
him
an
award.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
this
is
what
happened
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
they
just
stopped,
they
went
to
res
judicata
and
stopped.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
before
them,
but
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
and
we
bring
it
out
in
our
brief
the
question
we
ask
is
whether
or
not
a
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
because
we
briefed
all
the
other
issues
in
the
case
as
part
of
this
case.
in
other
words
all
issues
that
are
presented
are
before
this
court.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir
except
in
the
case
cited
by
counsel,
there
i
find
no
other
case
other
than
one
where
there
was
a
consent
directed
verdict
by
counsel,
that
is
cited
by
counsel,
but
no
other
case
that
i
could
find.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson

decided.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson

right
sir
other
than
what's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
we
have
just
a
few
cases
and
those
are
based
on
the
new
york
case.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson

honor.

harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
your
honor

harold
a.
