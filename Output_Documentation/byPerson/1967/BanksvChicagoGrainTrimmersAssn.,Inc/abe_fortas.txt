justice

this
court
matter
in
ordinary
litigation
and
the
same
facts
occurred,
would
you
be
able
to
maintain
your
second
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
ground?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
two
separate
cause
of
action,
you
got
cause
of
action
here
for
wrongful
death,
haven't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
in
terms
of
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
have
difficulty
with
that
analogy?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
that
cause
of
action?
justice
abe
fortas
the
widow
here
has
brought
an
action
for
wrongful
death,
hasn't
she?
justice
abe
fortas
and
she
brought
an
action
to
us
saying
wrongful
death
because
he
was
hit
what
by,
piece
of
steel
or
something.
justice
abe
fortas
by
what,
he
was
hit
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
piece
of
chain.
she
loses.
then
she
brings
another
action
for
the
wrongful
death
of
her
husband
and
in
that
action
she
says
the
wrongful
death
of
her
husband
was
caused
by
some
rope
that
hit
him,
is
that
right,
is
my
recollection
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
those
were
two
different
cause
of
action
and
if
this
had
been
--
these
had
been
actions
brought
in
court
of
law
that
they
would
have
been
two
different
cause
of
actions?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
deputy
commissioner
made
a
finding
that
the
deceased
or
claimant
had
not
been
on
board
to
ship
that
day
at
all
and
then
within
one
year,
the
deputy
commissioner
has
reason
to
believe
that
he
made
a
mistake
and
that
the
claimant
was
on
ship.
certainly,
that
kind
of
thing
would
be
covered
by
section
22
if
that
mistake
were
called
to
the
deputy
commissioner's
attention
within
a
year,
is
that
right?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
of
course,
getting
close
to
this
case.
suppose
that
the
deputy
commissioner
had
found
that
a
deceased
was
not
hit
by
the
rope
at
all.
and
then
within
one
year
the
deputy
commissioner
for
some
reason
rather
concludes
that
he
made
a
mistake
of
fact
and
he
reopened
the
case
under
section
22
you
say
he
cannot.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
certainly
it's
not
what
the
language
says,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of,
he
says
upon
his
own
initiatives
or
upon
the
application
of
any
party
in
interest
on
the
ground
of
--
no,
because
of
a
mistake
in
a
determination
of
the
fact
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
deputy
commissioner
may
accept
or
review
a
compensation
case.
justice
abe
fortas
that
sounds
and
reads
is
if
it's
very
broad
but
you
say
reading,
it
can
read

in
a
determination
of
fact
to
me
what
it
says
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is

of
33
u.s.c?
justice
abe
fortas
you
read
that,
i
won't
probably
going
to
the
read
the
entire
section
22,
but
it
does
refer
to
reviewing
a
compensation
case
in
a
court
with
procedure
prescribed
in
respect
to
claims
in
section
919
of
this
title,
then
goes
on
to
say
and
in

with
such
section
issue
a

compensation

which
may
terminate
continue
reinstate
increase
or
decrease
such
compensation

compensation.

he
could
reopen

if

you
square
