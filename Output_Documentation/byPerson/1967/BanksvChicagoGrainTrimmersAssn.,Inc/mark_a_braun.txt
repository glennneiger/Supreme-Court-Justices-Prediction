mr.
mark
a.
braun
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
developed
in
the
argument
there
are
three
issues
in
this
case,
the
determination
of
any
one
of
which
requires
the
reversal
of
the
award
entered
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
first
is
a
question
of
res
judicata.
this
is
the
issue
that
was
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
a
finding
that
it
should
be
applied,
it
did
reverse
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
other
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
compromise
has
not
been
determined
and
there
is
also
issue
of
substantiality
of
the
evidence
and
the
cause
of
connection
which
was
not
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
argument
now
appears
to
agree
and
the
briefed
now
appear
to
agree
which
was
not
true
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
maybe
applied
to
administrative
determination.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
of
all
the
wide
variety
of
administrative
determinations,
the
determination
of
the
liability
issue
in
a
compensation
case
most
of
all
requires
a
strict
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
because
it
is
a
judicial
determination
that
is
a
nature
of
a
judicial
determination
and
is
a
determination
of
a
past
fact.
i
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
very
briefly
to
the
purpose
of
this
statute
the
workmen's
compensation
statute,
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
this
type
of
social
legislation
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
situation
that
obtained
the
time
of
the
industrial
revolution.
work
connected
injuries
were
going
uncompensated.
the
employee
found
himself
in
the
position
most
frequently
where
he
had
no
recovery
for
on
the
job
injury.
the
reason
for
it
was
this.
the
development
of
corporate
employers,
the
employer
could
not
be
found.
he
could
not
prove
negligence
because
he
had
to
overcome
the
three
common
law
defenses,
of
contributory
negligence,
assumption
of
risk
and
fellow-servant
doctrine.
secondly,
the
reason
for
this
statue
was
that
the
expense
of
litigation
and
the
time
involved
prevented
the
employee
from
pursuing
his
claim,
therefore
compensation.
what
did
compensation
do?
immediately
it
eliminated
the
concept
of
negligence
entirely
with
reference
to
work
connected
injuries
and
substituted
a
system
of
showing
work
connection
only.
the
question
of
negligence
did
not,
was
not
involved
then
as
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
the
second
thing
that
the
compensation
did
was
to
provide
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
agency
as
opposed
to
the
court
and
a
jury,
again
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
prompt,
a
final,
and
an
inexpensive
determination
of
the
liability
issue.
with
that
purpose
in
mind
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
compensation
system
can
be
preserved
only
by
strict
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
if
that
is
not
done
then
in
any
industrial
injury
claim,
you
can
have
repeated
trials
on
the
question
of
work
connection.
the
employer
can
defend
a
case
first
of
all
on
the
ground
that
the
relationship
didn't
exist
then
they
could
have
no
trial
according
to
petitioner's
theory
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
accident
then
possibly
another
trial
on
whether
or
not
the
condition
preexisted.
and
after
all
of
those
trials
at
the
administrative
level
then
we
can
still
take
section
21
and
appeal
it
through
the
courts.
if
res
judicata
is
not
applied
then
the
primary
purpose
of
compensation
system
would
be
destroyed.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
section
22
and
i'll
get
to
that
a
little
more
detail
your
honor
was
strictly
to
give
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
administrative
agency,
a
vehicle
by
which
they
could
exercise
continuing
supervision
over
the
degree
of
disability
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
which
we
attempted
to
develop
in
our
brief
demonstrates
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
section
22
and
the
purpose
is
not
to
retry
the
issue
of
liability.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
the
purpose.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
award
for
the
medical
care
or
any
other
change
in
the
amount
of
compensation
as
it's
related
to
his
physical
condition.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
you
do
not.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
legislative
history,
i
have
cited
the
reports
of
the
commission
in
my
brief
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
specific
language
in
those
reports,
these
are
reports
of
the
commission
to
the
congress
with
reference
to
amendments
and
they
don't
specifically
say
that,
but
when
you
look
at
the
statutes
of
the
states
which
preceded
this
federal
statute,
this
was
the
restrictive
meaning
of
the
reopening
provision.
most
of
the
compensation
statutes
of
the
various
states
do
have
a
review
or
a
reopening
provision
and
it
is
directed
toward
this
function
of
supervising.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no,
new
york,
well,
new
york
has
a
similar
provision,
it
is
not
identical.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
but
it
similar
in
fact
that
it
talks
about
a
change
of
condition.
the
new
york
statute
does
not
have
to
my
knowledge
the
word
mistake
in
it.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
well
and
this
is
the
question,
what
do
they
mean
by
that
in
this
section.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
there
would
be
a
change
of
condition
in
both
terms
i
use
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
this
part
of
the
question.
what
do
they
mean
with
the
same
mistake,
what
kind
of
mistake?
mr.
mark
a.
braun
by
looking
at,
what
i
see
--
well,
this
statute
first
of
all
started
with
change
of
condition
only.
it
is
my
feeling
that
because
this
statute
does
not
have
any
provision
as
many
statutes
do
for
changing
a
simple
clerical
error,
but
that's
what
it's
for.
it
doesn't
say
that's
what
it's
for.
we
could
only
go
into
the
background
to
attempt
to
determine
what
the
word
is
therefore.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
--
any
of
cases
distributed
with
that.
returning
to
my
original
thought
that
i
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i'd
disagree
with
that.
this
would
be
a
basic
question
of
liability
and
with
reference
to,
if
you're
not
on
board
ship,
so
you
were
on
land
and
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
at
all
and
in
that
narrow
area
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court,
but
only
in
that
de
novo
area.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
it
is
our
position
that
he
cannot.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
language
simply
says
he
may
review
a
determination.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
what
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
only
in,
for
the
purpose
of
that
section
and
this
goes
to
the
physical
condition
or
the
degree
of
disability
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
only
purpose
of
that
section
because
if
we
do
not
limit
the
purpose
of
section
22
to
a
reexamination
of
the
extent
of
the
degree
of
disability
then
we
have
again
destroyed
the
purpose
of
the
whole
statute
to
give
a
prompt
and
efficient,
definite
remedy.
and
going
back
to
all
of
the
cases,
in
other
states
and
even
in
the
cases
under
section
22,
isn't
it
strange
that
in
all
this
time,
there
is
no
case
and
they
haven't
cited
a
case
where
they
relitigated
the
liability
issue.
every
single
section
22
case
from
the
outset
has
to
do
with
the
degree
of
disability
and
this
our
position
with
reference
to
22.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
919
is
the
section
which
provides
that
compensation
maybe
awarded.
it's
a
general
terminology,
general
section
as
to
the
entry
of
an
award.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
reference
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
question
about
it
and
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
nature
of
these
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
reference
to
section
19
and
section
22
is
to
suggest
that
he
would
use
the
same
procedure
that
is
the
order
hearing,
ignorance
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
because
in
most
of
these
cases
your
honor,
not
most
of
it,
but
in
many
cases
you
can
have
a
determination
of
liability
without
an
award
of
compensation.
take
for
example
the
man
that
has
a
back
injury,
the
employer
pays
his
medical
expenses
and
he
pays
him
his
weekly
compensation
benefits
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
he
goes
back
to
work,
but
he
files
a
claim.
he
is
doing
the
same
job,
but
his
back
is
still
hurting
him.
the
deputy
commissioner
says
no
compensation
due.
three
months
later
the
back
gets
so
bad
that
he
needs
further
medical
care
or
he
is
unable
to
work
under
this
section
he
can
then
award
comp
although
he
did
not
before
and
i
think
this
the
purpose
of
that
section.
with
reference
to
the
general
application
of
res
judicata
i
do
think
that
the,
this
court's
opinion
in
baltimore
versus
philips
is
very
clearly
pertinent
in
that
it
established
that
there
is
but
a
single
cause
of
action.
now
in
that
case
admittedly
the
court
was
referring
to
the
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
allege
all
of
the
various
possible
elements
or
types
of
negligence
in
a
single
action.
now
that
case
becomes
analogous
with
a
compensation
situation
only
when
we
recognize
that
negligence
is
not
a
factor
here
but
that
the
entire
body
of
work
activity
must
be
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no,
the
prior
payment,
no
your
honor
i
did
not
say
that,
i
say
that
that
it
may
be
utilized
only
when
there
has
been
a
prior
determination
that
an
industrial
injury
occurred,
now
it
doesn't
have
been
a
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
correct,
now
if
that
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
it
is.
very
frequently
the
employer
will
commence
the
payments
without
any
hearing
at
all,
but
if
we
have
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
without
any
award
if
you
have
that
circumstance
and
the
employee
then
wants
to
get
an
award
he
doesn't
file
under
22,
he
files
an
initial
claim.
he
doesn't
file
a
reopening
claim
or
a
modification
claim
under
22.
he
files
his
first
case
and
at
that
time
the
employer
could
even
though
he
has
paid
comp,
question
liability.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
this
section
that
can
be
used
only
with
reference
to
disability,
this
section
i
suggest
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
the
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
exact
determination
has
been
made
that
that
the
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
except
under
section
21,
which
in
30
days
through
the
courts
yes.
i
suggest
that
that
holding
is
essential
to
preserve
the
right
of
thought
here
because
if
we,
if
it
is
not
so
interpreted
then
anybody
can
re-litigate
and
re-litigate
ad
infinitum.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
as
in
this
case
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well
this
is
the
thing
where
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employee
either
is
even
a
greater
hardship.
the
employee
would
have
only
one
year
if
the
claim
were
denied,
but
this
section
also
says
that
it
maybe
possibly
reopened
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
last
payment.
yes,
so
if
there
is
an
award
finding
liability
and
awarding
compensation
and
then
the
employer
decides
he
wants
to
contest
that
basic
liability
issue
his
chance
to
contest
it,
does
not
terminate
with
one
year.
every
time
he
sends
out
a
weekly
compensation
check
the
year
is
extended
and
is
reapplied.
so
the
employer
under
their
interpretation
could
contest
any
liability
issue
forever
so
long
as
some
payment
was
being
paid.
i
don't
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
absolutely
not
the
intention
of
the
statute
to
permit
that
type
of
interminable
litigation
on
the
liability
issue.
with
reference
to
res
judicata
the
one
other
comment
was
raised,
one
other
objection
to
the
application
and
that
is
that
in
this
case
the
employer
prevented
the
petitioners
from
bringing
forth
all
aspects
of
their
claim
in
one
hearing.
an
examination
of
the
chronology
of
events
i
think
shows
that
that
simply
is
not
true.
i
think
first
of
all
we
must
consider
the
relationship
here.
the
chicago
grain
trimmers
association
inc
is
in
fact
a
corporation,
but
it
is
a
corporation
owned
by
the
men
that
do
this
type
of
work,
grain
trimming
is
nothing
of
than
loading
or
unloading
grain.
the
men
that
do
this
work
formed
a
corporation.
john
banks
the
deceased
in
this
case
was
an
organizer
of
that
corporation.
his
brother
lawrence
banks
was
in
fact
the
president
of
the
corporation
at
the
time
that
john
banks
felt
down
at
home
and
sustained
fatal
injuries.
frank
costello
was
a
trustee
of
the
association.
frank
costello
is
the
brother
of
mrs.
banks.
now
so
that
the
petitioners
here
that
widow
and
the
children
are
very
closely
associated
with
the
employing
entity.
john
banks
felt
down
at
home
on
january
30th,
he
struck
his
head
in
the
basement
floor
and
it
is
agreed
throughout
the
record
that
the
fatal
injury
sustained
there
what
caused
his
death
12
days
later,
13
days
later.
when
mrs.
banks
testified
in
the
first
trial,
excuse
me,
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
it
was
alleged
that
there
had
been
a
cable
snapping
incident
on
january
26th,
and
a
series
of
witnesses,
10
or
12
of
them
were
brought
in
and
the
whole
sphere
of
john
banks
activity
from
january
26th
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
was
explored.
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
mrs.
banks
admitted
that
right
after
the
funeral
she
and
her
son
and
her
brother
had
discussed
this
alleged
i
assume
was
called
alleged
rope
falling
incident
of
january
30th.
they
discussed
it
at
home.
she
discussed
it
with
her
lawyer
prior
to
the
first
trial.
her
lawyer
knew
about
this
alleged
incident
prior
to
the
first
trial.
now
when
all
of
these
witnesses
were
presented
in
the
first
trial
not
one
of
them
mentioned
anything
about
it.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
because
at
that
time
--
from
here
i
will
finish
this
one
and
i'll
come
right
to
that.
the
lawyer
and
mrs.
banks
said
throughout
--
in
all
of
her
testimony
i
cross
examined
them,
when
i
ask
them
about
the
30th
what
happened,
how
did
he
feel,
what
did
he
look
like,
what
did
he
say,
we
into
his
activities
in
that
day.
in
my
finding
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
had
a
penciled
memorandum
from
an
investigator
who
said
that
one
man
had
talked
about
a
rope
incident
at
that
time.
this
investigator
and
this
testimony
is
in
the
record,
this
investigator
said
he
checked
it
out
and
there
was
no
substance
to
it
whatsoever
because
the
date
was
wrong,
he
suggested
the
rope
incident
when
at
a
time
like
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
operations
had
stopped
a
half
a
hour
and
then
they
worked
for
two
more
hours.
that
would
be
closing
time
up
to
about
4
o'clock
or
after.
on
this
day,
january
30th
everybody
left
before
2:30.
so
this
notation
was
in
the
file
that
somebody
had
said
this,
but
on
checking
it
out
the
investigator
said
this
is
after
thought
it
just
doesn't
clear
out,
doesn't,
doesn't
it
is
not
supported
by
anybody
and
then
all
of
the
other
people
were
interviewed
court
reporter
statements
were
taken
and
there
wasn't
a
single
bit
of
collaboration
to
this
one
statement.
so
i
suggest
even
looking
at
it
from
this
date
that
notation
did
not
even
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
may
have
been
another
incident.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
man.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
and
he
is
the
only
witness.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
but
not,
not
substantially
no.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well
this
is
the
point
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
the
investigator
had
concluded
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
this.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
he
described
rope-falling
incident,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
with
reference
to
that
and
it
is
outlined
in
more
detail
in
the
substantiality
issue
that
even
if
you
take
mere
modest
testimony
before
the
deputy
commissioner,
no
member
of
this
court
could
believe
that
there
ever
was
a
rope-falling
incident.
i'll
mention
it
just
briefly
now.
he
said
that
john
banks
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
barge,
that
there
was
rope
from
--
in
front
of
him
passing
above
his
head
to
a
pulley
some
50
feet
above
his
head.
that
this
rope
broke,
he
didn't
see
it
break,
but
the
rope
then
in
a
free
fall
coiled
into
a
ball
and
inner
ball
sat
upon
his
head
and
then
he
leaned
forward
over
the
hatch
cover
this
ball
of
coil
rope
remain
on
his
head.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
don't
know
they
did
and
this
is
part
of
the
compromise
for
this
reason
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
they
did
your
honor
and
they
did
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
there
was
a
resident
--
for
instruction
in
that
case
and
i
think
that's
why
the
judge
in
the
jury
case
was
ready
to
set
it
aside.
there
were
nine
paragraphs
of
error
in
that
jury
trial.
now--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
this
is
correct
that
something
may
have
happened
on
that
date.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
then
there
was
that
jury
verdict,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
certainly
from
the
conduct
of
the
first
hearing
there
was
no
withholding.
if
anybody
had
any
knowledge
about
it
mrs.
banks
did
and
as
far
as
statutory
requirement
reference
to
notice,
the
statute
here
says
that
an
employee
or
the
employee's
dependents
have
an
obligation
to
file
a
written
notice
when
an
accident
occurs
with
the
deputy
commissioner
and
with
the
employer
advising
the
employer
of
the
occurrence.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
on
the
employer.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
obligation
on
the
employer
your
honor
is
when
they
learn
of
an
incident
think
of
the
time
again,
this
man
died
on
february
12,
this
statement
was
taken
on
april
8th
five
weeks
before
the
trial
when
an
application
has
already
been
filed
and
the
only
penalty
is
that
the
statute
limitations
has
not
run,
but
what's
the
penalty
on
the
--
on
an
employee
or
a
petitioner
for
not
notifying
the
employer
or
not
notifying
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
claim
is
barred.
now
mrs.
banks
testified
that
she
knew
about
the
rope
incident
and
that
she
knew
about
it
right
after
the
death
and
she
talked
about
it
with
her
lawyer
before
the
trial.
they
didn't
file
any
form
that's
required
under
the
statute
and
that
failure
to
give
written
notice
in
and
of
itself
bars
the
second
claim.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
your
honor
the
second
trial
it
came
out
that
they
knew
about
this
and
withheld
it,
didn't
mention
it
during
the
first
trial.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
that
is
true
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
i
talked
about
this
because
it
was
brought
up
for
the
reason
that
res
judicata
can
apply
if
they
were
prevented
from
bringing
it
out.
i
mention
only
because
they
simply
were
not
prevented.
they
knew
about
it
in
every
opportunity
to
bring
it
out
that's
the
only
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
there
is
a
second
full
and
complete
question
here
your
honor
and
that
is
compromise
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
--
well
i
wouldn't
presume
and
tell
what
you
should
do,
you
have
certainly
have
the
right
to
one
of
the
issue
brought
here
as
you
do
have
the
right
to
decide
the
substantiality
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
what
happened
here
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
not
ordinarily
no.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
i
can
make
up
a
compensation
case
when
you
did.
i
know
your
honors
before
that.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
both,
all
three
issues
are
put
forth
in
the
brief.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
this
is
why
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
can't
be
hurt
because
it
is
not
a
complicated
issue.
there
is
not
a
great
mass
of
evidence
on
it
and
this
is
true
also
with
the
substantiality
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
two
commission
trials
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
we
do
not.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
the
issue
of
compromise.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
of
substantiality
it's
there
yes
and
we
suggest
there
that
even
if
you
believe
the
issue
of
substantiality
goes
to
the
point
even
if
you
believe
that
there
was
a
rope
incident
there
is
no
proof
that
that
rope
incident
had
anything
to
do
with
this
man
catapulting
down
the
basement
steps
at
home.
one
cause
of
connection
witness
he
said
yes
and
then
when
the
deputy
commissioner
reminded
him
what
the
real
facts
were
he
said
no
it
could
not
happen.
i
think
that
just
does
not
meet
the
test
of
substantiality.
in
concluding
i
would
again
wish
to
re-urge
the
issue
of
compromise.
the
employer
has
liability
without
fault
under
compensation
when
negligence
is
eliminated
but
section
33
does
intend
to
protect
the
employer
when
there
is
a
recovery
against
a
third
party.
the
language
is
very
clear.
if
you
compromise
a
case
without
the
employers
written
approval,
you
may
not
proceed
with
compensation.
this
is
precisely
what
they
did
and
the
real
fact
of
this
occurrence,
the
entry
of
remittitur,
fact
that
this
compromise
is
called
a
remittitur
does
not
make
it
a
compromise
remittitur
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
mr.
--
there
is
one
case
cited
in
their
brief,
the
gallagher
case
where
a
remittitur
was
entered.
the
new
york
court
said
that
was
not
a
--
they
said
it
was
not
a
compromise,
but
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
gallagher
case
shows
clearly
that
the
judge
was
asked
to
evaluate
damages,
this
was
only
issue
before
him.
in
our
case
that's
the
one
thing
he
wasn't
asked
to
do.
there
were
nine
paragraphs
of
error
with
reference
to
that
jury
trial
but
he
was
not
asked
to
evaluate
damages
and
it's
apparent
that
if
there
was
liability
in
that
case,
it
was
worth
a
lot
more
than
$19,000.
a
49-year
old
man
earning
$5000
a
year
just
compute
that
with
his
normal
work
expectancy
11
to
15
years
plus
medical
cost
plus
pain
and
suffering
plus
all
the
personal
elements
of
our
laws
of
conception.
on
its
face
it
is
not
an
evaluation
of
maximum
damages.
now
they
didn't
want
to
retry
that
case,
there
was
a
simple
remedy,
for
the
employer
is
to
be
considered
--
had
pretrial
on
this
case.
give
us
an
opportunity
to
retry
it
and
let
us
go
for
the
big
judgment.
we
could
have
gone
maybe
for
a
$100,000
because
the
death
limitation
in
illinois
has
been
under
attack
and
i
think
if
the
statute
intends
that
the
employer
have
that
right.
they
deprived
themselves
of
that
right
and
therefore
it
cannot
proceed
in
the
second
compensation
hearing.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
developed
in
the
argument
there
are
three
issues
in
this
case,
the
determination
of
any
one
of
which
requires
the
reversal
of
the
award
entered
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
first
is
a
question
of
res
judicata.
this
is
the
issue
that
was
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
a
finding
that
it
should
be
applied,
it
did
reverse
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
other
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
compromise
has
not
been
determined
and
there
is
also
issue
of
substantiality
of
the
evidence
and
the
cause
of
connection
which
was
not
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
argument
now
appears
to
agree
and
the
briefed
now
appear
to
agree
which
was
not
true
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
maybe
applied
to
administrative
determination.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
of
all
the
wide
variety
of
administrative
determinations,
the
determination
of
the
liability
issue
in
a
compensation
case
most
of
all
requires
a
strict
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
because
it
is
a
judicial
determination
that
is
a
nature
of
a
judicial
determination
and
is
a
determination
of
a
past
fact.
i
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
very
briefly
to
the
purpose
of
this
statute
the
workmen's
compensation
statute,
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
this
type
of
social
legislation
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
situation
that
obtained
the
time
of
the
industrial
revolution.
work
connected
injuries
were
going
uncompensated.
the
employee
found
himself
in
the
position
most
frequently
where
he
had
no
recovery
for
on
the
job
injury.
the
reason
for
it
was
this.
the
development
of
corporate
employers,
the
employer
could
not
be
found.
he
could
not
prove
negligence
because
he
had
to
overcome
the
three
common
law
defenses,
of
contributory
negligence,
assumption
of
risk
and
fellow-servant
doctrine.
secondly,
the
reason
for
this
statue
was
that
the
expense
of
litigation
and
the
time
involved
prevented
the
employee
from
pursuing
his
claim,
therefore
compensation.
what
did
compensation
do?
immediately
it
eliminated
the
concept
of
negligence
entirely
with
reference
to
work
connected
injuries
and
substituted
a
system
of
showing
work
connection
only.
the
question
of
negligence
did
not,
was
not
involved
then
as
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
the
second
thing
that
the
compensation
did
was
to
provide
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
agency
as
opposed
to
the
court
and
a
jury,
again
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
prompt,
a
final,
and
an
inexpensive
determination
of
the
liability
issue.
with
that
purpose
in
mind
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
compensation
system
can
be
preserved
only
by
strict
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
if
that
is
not
done
then
in
any
industrial
injury
claim,
you
can
have
repeated
trials
on
the
question
of
work
connection.
the
employer
can
defend
a
case
first
of
all
on
the
ground
that
the
relationship
didn't
exist
then
they
could
have
no
trial
according
to
petitioner's
theory
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
accident
then
possibly
another
trial
on
whether
or
not
the
condition
preexisted.
and
after
all
of
those
trials
at
the
administrative
level
then
we
can
still
take
section
21
and
appeal
it
through
the
courts.
if
res
judicata
is
not
applied
then
the
primary
purpose
of
compensation
system
would
be
destroyed.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
section
22
and
i'll
get
to
that
a
little
more
detail
your
honor
was
strictly
to
give
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
administrative
agency,
a
vehicle
by
which
they
could
exercise
continuing
supervision
over
the
degree
of
disability
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
which
we
attempted
to
develop
in
our
brief
demonstrates
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
section
22
and
the
purpose
is
not
to
retry
the
issue
of
liability.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
the
purpose.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
award
for
the
medical
care
or
any
other
change
in
the
amount
of
compensation
as
it's
related
to
his
physical
condition.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
you
do
not.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
legislative
history,
i
have
cited
the
reports
of
the
commission
in
my
brief
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
specific
language
in
those
reports,
these
are
reports
of
the
commission
to
the
congress
with
reference
to
amendments
and
they
don't
specifically
say
that,
but
when
you
look
at
the
statutes
of
the
states
which
preceded
this
federal
statute,
this
was
the
restrictive
meaning
of
the
reopening
provision.
most
of
the
compensation
statutes
of
the
various
states
do
have
a
review
or
a
reopening
provision
and
it
is
directed
toward
this
function
of
supervising.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no,
new
york,
well,
new
york
has
a
similar
provision,
it
is
not
identical.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
but
it
similar
in
fact
that
it
talks
about
a
change
of
condition.
the
new
york
statute
does
not
have
to
my
knowledge
the
word
mistake
in
it.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
well
and
this
is
the
question,
what
do
they
mean
by
that
in
this
section.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
there
would
be
a
change
of
condition
in
both
terms
i
use
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
this
part
of
the
question.
what
do
they
mean
with
the
same
mistake,
what
kind
of
mistake?
mr.
mark
a.
braun
by
looking
at,
what
i
see
--
well,
this
statute
first
of
all
started
with
change
of
condition
only.
it
is
my
feeling
that
because
this
statute
does
not
have
any
provision
as
many
statutes
do
for
changing
a
simple
clerical
error,
but
that's
what
it's
for.
it
doesn't
say
that's
what
it's
for.
we
could
only
go
into
the
background
to
attempt
to
determine
what
the
word
is
therefore.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
--
any
of
cases
distributed
with
that.
returning
to
my
original
thought
that
i
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i'd
disagree
with
that.
this
would
be
a
basic
question
of
liability
and
with
reference
to,
if
you're
not
on
board
ship,
so
you
were
on
land
and
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
at
all
and
in
that
narrow
area
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court,
but
only
in
that
de
novo
area.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
it
is
our
position
that
he
cannot.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
language
simply
says
he
may
review
a
determination.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
what
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
only
in,
for
the
purpose
of
that
section
and
this
goes
to
the
physical
condition
or
the
degree
of
disability
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
only
purpose
of
that
section
because
if
we
do
not
limit
the
purpose
of
section
22
to
a
reexamination
of
the
extent
of
the
degree
of
disability
then
we
have
again
destroyed
the
purpose
of
the
whole
statute
to
give
a
prompt
and
efficient,
definite
remedy.
and
going
back
to
all
of
the
cases,
in
other
states
and
even
in
the
cases
under
section
22,
isn't
it
strange
that
in
all
this
time,
there
is
no
case
and
they
haven't
cited
a
case
where
they
relitigated
the
liability
issue.
every
single
section
22
case
from
the
outset
has
to
do
with
the
degree
of
disability
and
this
our
position
with
reference
to
22.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
919
is
the
section
which
provides
that
compensation
maybe
awarded.
it's
a
general
terminology,
general
section
as
to
the
entry
of
an
award.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
reference
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
question
about
it
and
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
nature
of
these
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
reference
to
section
19
and
section
22
is
to
suggest
that
he
would
use
the
same
procedure
that
is
the
order
hearing,
ignorance
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
because
in
most
of
these
cases
your
honor,
not
most
of
it,
but
in
many
cases
you
can
have
a
determination
of
liability
without
an
award
of
compensation.
take
for
example
the
man
that
has
a
back
injury,
the
employer
pays
his
medical
expenses
and
he
pays
him
his
weekly
compensation
benefits
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
he
goes
back
to
work,
but
he
files
a
claim.
he
is
doing
the
same
job,
but
his
back
is
still
hurting
him.
the
deputy
commissioner
says
no
compensation
due.
three
months
later
the
back
gets
so
bad
that
he
needs
further
medical
care
or
he
is
unable
to
work
under
this
section
he
can
then
award
comp
although
he
did
not
before
and
i
think
this
the
purpose
of
that
section.
with
reference
to
the
general
application
of
res
judicata
i
do
think
that
the,
this
court's
opinion
in
baltimore
versus
philips
is
very
clearly
pertinent
in
that
it
established
that
there
is
but
a
single
cause
of
action.
now
in
that
case
admittedly
the
court
was
referring
to
the
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
allege
all
of
the
various
possible
elements
or
types
of
negligence
in
a
single
action.
now
that
case
becomes
analogous
with
a
compensation
situation
only
when
we
recognize
that
negligence
is
not
a
factor
here
but
that
the
entire
body
of
work
activity
must
be
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no,
the
prior
payment,
no
your
honor
i
did
not
say
that,
i
say
that
that
it
may
be
utilized
only
when
there
has
been
a
prior
determination
that
an
industrial
injury
occurred,
now
it
doesn't
have
been
a
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
is
correct,
now
if
that
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
it
is.
very
frequently
the
employer
will
commence
the
payments
without
any
hearing
at
all,
but
if
we
have
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
without
any
award
if
you
have
that
circumstance
and
the
employee
then
wants
to
get
an
award
he
doesn't
file
under
22,
he
files
an
initial
claim.
he
doesn't
file
a
reopening
claim
or
a
modification
claim
under
22.
he
files
his
first
case
and
at
that
time
the
employer
could
even
though
he
has
paid
comp,
question
liability.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
this
section
that
can
be
used
only
with
reference
to
disability,
this
section
i
suggest
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
the
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
exact
determination
has
been
made
that
that
the
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
except
under
section
21,
which
in
30
days
through
the
courts
yes.
i
suggest
that
that
holding
is
essential
to
preserve
the
right
of
thought
here
because
if
we,
if
it
is
not
so
interpreted
then
anybody
can
re-litigate
and
re-litigate
ad
infinitum.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
as
in
this
case
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well
this
is
the
thing
where
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employee
either
is
even
a
greater
hardship.
the
employee
would
have
only
one
year
if
the
claim
were
denied,
but
this
section
also
says
that
it
maybe
possibly
reopened
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
last
payment.
yes,
so
if
there
is
an
award
finding
liability
and
awarding
compensation
and
then
the
employer
decides
he
wants
to
contest
that
basic
liability
issue
his
chance
to
contest
it,
does
not
terminate
with
one
year.
every
time
he
sends
out
a
weekly
compensation
check
the
year
is
extended
and
is
reapplied.
so
the
employer
under
their
interpretation
could
contest
any
liability
issue
forever
so
long
as
some
payment
was
being
paid.
i
don't
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
absolutely
not
the
intention
of
the
statute
to
permit
that
type
of
interminable
litigation
on
the
liability
issue.
with
reference
to
res
judicata
the
one
other
comment
was
raised,
one
other
objection
to
the
application
and
that
is
that
in
this
case
the
employer
prevented
the
petitioners
from
bringing
forth
all
aspects
of
their
claim
in
one
hearing.
an
examination
of
the
chronology
of
events
i
think
shows
that
that
simply
is
not
true.
i
think
first
of
all
we
must
consider
the
relationship
here.
the
chicago
grain
trimmers
association
inc
is
in
fact
a
corporation,
but
it
is
a
corporation
owned
by
the
men
that
do
this
type
of
work,
grain
trimming
is
nothing
of
than
loading
or
unloading
grain.
the
men
that
do
this
work
formed
a
corporation.
john
banks
the
deceased
in
this
case
was
an
organizer
of
that
corporation.
his
brother
lawrence
banks
was
in
fact
the
president
of
the
corporation
at
the
time
that
john
banks
felt
down
at
home
and
sustained
fatal
injuries.
frank
costello
was
a
trustee
of
the
association.
frank
costello
is
the
brother
of
mrs.
banks.
now
so
that
the
petitioners
here
that
widow
and
the
children
are
very
closely
associated
with
the
employing
entity.
john
banks
felt
down
at
home
on
january
30th,
he
struck
his
head
in
the
basement
floor
and
it
is
agreed
throughout
the
record
that
the
fatal
injury
sustained
there
what
caused
his
death
12
days
later,
13
days
later.
when
mrs.
banks
testified
in
the
first
trial,
excuse
me,
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
it
was
alleged
that
there
had
been
a
cable
snapping
incident
on
january
26th,
and
a
series
of
witnesses,
10
or
12
of
them
were
brought
in
and
the
whole
sphere
of
john
banks
activity
from
january
26th
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
was
explored.
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
mrs.
banks
admitted
that
right
after
the
funeral
she
and
her
son
and
her
brother
had
discussed
this
alleged
i
assume
was
called
alleged
rope
falling
incident
of
january
30th.
they
discussed
it
at
home.
she
discussed
it
with
her
lawyer
prior
to
the
first
trial.
her
lawyer
knew
about
this
alleged
incident
prior
to
the
first
trial.
now
when
all
of
these
witnesses
were
presented
in
the
first
trial
not
one
of
them
mentioned
anything
about
it.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
because
at
that
time
--
from
here
i
will
finish
this
one
and
i'll
come
right
to
that.
the
lawyer
and
mrs.
banks
said
throughout
--
in
all
of
her
testimony
i
cross
examined
them,
when
i
ask
them
about
the
30th
what
happened,
how
did
he
feel,
what
did
he
look
like,
what
did
he
say,
we
into
his
activities
in
that
day.
in
my
finding
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
had
a
penciled
memorandum
from
an
investigator
who
said
that
one
man
had
talked
about
a
rope
incident
at
that
time.
this
investigator
and
this
testimony
is
in
the
record,
this
investigator
said
he
checked
it
out
and
there
was
no
substance
to
it
whatsoever
because
the
date
was
wrong,
he
suggested
the
rope
incident
when
at
a
time
like
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
operations
had
stopped
a
half
a
hour
and
then
they
worked
for
two
more
hours.
that
would
be
closing
time
up
to
about
4
o'clock
or
after.
on
this
day,
january
30th
everybody
left
before
2:30.
so
this
notation
was
in
the
file
that
somebody
had
said
this,
but
on
checking
it
out
the
investigator
said
this
is
after
thought
it
just
doesn't
clear
out,
doesn't,
doesn't
it
is
not
supported
by
anybody
and
then
all
of
the
other
people
were
interviewed
court
reporter
statements
were
taken
and
there
wasn't
a
single
bit
of
collaboration
to
this
one
statement.
so
i
suggest
even
looking
at
it
from
this
date
that
notation
did
not
even
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
may
have
been
another
incident.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
that
man.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
and
he
is
the
only
witness.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
but
not,
not
substantially
no.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well
this
is
the
point
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
the
investigator
had
concluded
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
this.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
he
described
rope-falling
incident,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
with
reference
to
that
and
it
is
outlined
in
more
detail
in
the
substantiality
issue
that
even
if
you
take
mere
modest
testimony
before
the
deputy
commissioner,
no
member
of
this
court
could
believe
that
there
ever
was
a
rope-falling
incident.
i'll
mention
it
just
briefly
now.
he
said
that
john
banks
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
barge,
that
there
was
rope
from
--
in
front
of
him
passing
above
his
head
to
a
pulley
some
50
feet
above
his
head.
that
this
rope
broke,
he
didn't
see
it
break,
but
the
rope
then
in
a
free
fall
coiled
into
a
ball
and
inner
ball
sat
upon
his
head
and
then
he
leaned
forward
over
the
hatch
cover
this
ball
of
coil
rope
remain
on
his
head.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
don't
know
they
did
and
this
is
part
of
the
compromise
for
this
reason
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
they
did
your
honor
and
they
did
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
there
was
a
resident
--
for
instruction
in
that
case
and
i
think
that's
why
the
judge
in
the
jury
case
was
ready
to
set
it
aside.
there
were
nine
paragraphs
of
error
in
that
jury
trial.
now--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
this
is
correct
that
something
may
have
happened
on
that
date.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
then
there
was
that
jury
verdict,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
certainly
from
the
conduct
of
the
first
hearing
there
was
no
withholding.
if
anybody
had
any
knowledge
about
it
mrs.
banks
did
and
as
far
as
statutory
requirement
reference
to
notice,
the
statute
here
says
that
an
employee
or
the
employee's
dependents
have
an
obligation
to
file
a
written
notice
when
an
accident
occurs
with
the
deputy
commissioner
and
with
the
employer
advising
the
employer
of
the
occurrence.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
on
the
employer.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
obligation
on
the
employer
your
honor
is
when
they
learn
of
an
incident
think
of
the
time
again,
this
man
died
on
february
12,
this
statement
was
taken
on
april
8th
five
weeks
before
the
trial
when
an
application
has
already
been
filed
and
the
only
penalty
is
that
the
statute
limitations
has
not
run,
but
what's
the
penalty
on
the
--
on
an
employee
or
a
petitioner
for
not
notifying
the
employer
or
not
notifying
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
claim
is
barred.
now
mrs.
banks
testified
that
she
knew
about
the
rope
incident
and
that
she
knew
about
it
right
after
the
death
and
she
talked
about
it
with
her
lawyer
before
the
trial.
they
didn't
file
any
form
that's
required
under
the
statute
and
that
failure
to
give
written
notice
in
and
of
itself
bars
the
second
claim.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
your
honor
the
second
trial
it
came
out
that
they
knew
about
this
and
withheld
it,
didn't
mention
it
during
the
first
trial.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
that
is
true
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
i
talked
about
this
because
it
was
brought
up
for
the
reason
that
res
judicata
can
apply
if
they
were
prevented
from
bringing
it
out.
i
mention
only
because
they
simply
were
not
prevented.
they
knew
about
it
in
every
opportunity
to
bring
it
out
that's
the
only
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes,
there
is
a
second
full
and
complete
question
here
your
honor
and
that
is
compromise
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
think
--
well
i
wouldn't
presume
and
tell
what
you
should
do,
you
have
certainly
have
the
right
to
one
of
the
issue
brought
here
as
you
do
have
the
right
to
decide
the
substantiality
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
what
happened
here
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
not
ordinarily
no.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
i
can
make
up
a
compensation
case
when
you
did.
i
know
your
honors
before
that.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
both,
all
three
issues
are
put
forth
in
the
brief.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
well,
this
is
why
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
can't
be
hurt
because
it
is
not
a
complicated
issue.
there
is
not
a
great
mass
of
evidence
on
it
and
this
is
true
also
with
the
substantiality
issue.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
the
two
commission
trials
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
we
do
not.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
the
issue
of
compromise.
mr.
mark
a.
braun
of
substantiality
it's
there
yes
and
we
suggest
there
that
even
if
you
believe
the
issue
of
substantiality
goes
to
the
point
even
if
you
believe
that
there
was
a
rope
incident
there
is
no
proof
that
that
rope
incident
had
anything
to
do
with
this
man
catapulting
down
the
basement
steps
at
home.
one
cause
of
connection
witness
he
said
yes
and
then
when
the
deputy
commissioner
reminded
him
what
the
real
facts
were
he
said
no
it
could
not
happen.
i
think
that
just
does
not
meet
the
test
of
substantiality.
in
concluding
i
would
again
wish
to
re-urge
the
issue
of
compromise.
the
employer
has
liability
without
fault
under
compensation
when
negligence
is
eliminated
but
section
33
does
intend
to
protect
the
employer
when
there
is
a
recovery
against
a
third
party.
the
language
is
very
clear.
if
you
compromise
a
case
without
the
employers
written
approval,
you
may
not
proceed
with
compensation.
this
is
precisely
what
they
did
and
the
real
fact
of
this
occurrence,
the
entry
of
remittitur,
fact
that
this
compromise
is
called
a
remittitur
does
not
make
it
a
compromise
remittitur
--
mr.
mark
a.
braun
no
mr.
--
there
is
one
case
cited
in
their
brief,
the
gallagher
case
where
a
remittitur
was
entered.
the
new
york
court
said
that
was
not
a
--
they
said
it
was
not
a
compromise,
but
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
gallagher
case
shows
clearly
that
the
judge
was
asked
to
evaluate
damages,
this
was
only
issue
before
him.
in
our
case
that's
the
one
thing
he
wasn't
asked
to
do.
there
were
nine
paragraphs
of
error
with
reference
to
that
jury
trial
but
he
was
not
asked
to
evaluate
damages
and
it's
apparent
that
if
there
was
liability
in
that
case,
it
was
worth
a
lot
more
than
$19,000.
a
49-year
old
man
earning
$5000
a
year
just
compute
that
with
his
normal
work
expectancy
11
to
15
years
plus
medical
cost
plus
pain
and
suffering
plus
all
the
personal
elements
of
our
laws
of
conception.
on
its
face
it
is
not
an
evaluation
of
maximum
damages.
now
they
didn't
want
to
retry
that
case,
there
was
a
simple
remedy,
for
the
employer
is
to
be
considered
--
had
pretrial
on
this
case.
give
us
an
opportunity
to
retry
it
and
let
us
go
for
the
big
judgment.
we
could
have
gone
maybe
for
a
$100,000
because
the
death
limitation
in
illinois
has
been
under
attack
and
i
think
if
the
statute
intends
that
the
employer
have
that
right.
they
deprived
themselves
of
that
right
and
therefore
it
cannot
proceed
in
the
second
compensation
hearing.
