justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
liebenson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
prevail
do
you
have
to
cut
at
that
$19,000
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
well,
i'm
just,
so
that
there's
a
possibility
of
recovery
in
this
proceeding
in
excess
of
$19,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
is
that,
does
70
mean
this
is,
the
statute
provides
a
computation
which
produces
70,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
telling
us
is
that
you
could
have
not
got
hold
of
the
copy
of
this
report.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
their
possession
which
you
say
reveled
that
there
had
been
this
additional
incident
on
the
30th
of
january.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
even
if
you
are
wrong
about
that
as
applied
to
a
lawsuit,
you
have
a
statutory
provision
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
permits
you
to
do
what
you
--
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
being
right
about
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
incidentally
may
i
ask
on
discovery?
suppose
there
is
discovery
here,
suppose
you
did
have
a
right
of
discovery
and
you
didn't
exercise
it,
would
you
be
taking
--
would
you
figure
--
foreclose
them
from
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
is
there
any
copy
of
that
form
202
in
the
appendix?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
was
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
that
supposed
to
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
obligation
the
statute
imposes
on
the
employer,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
he
finally
get
hold
to
this
information
that
had
been
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
he
say,
that
he
had
filed
such
a
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
jury
finding
--
is
that
res
judicata
against
the
employer
as
to
happening
on
january
30?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
issue
of
remittitur
under
33
been
litigated
in
any
other
case
that
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
issue
whether
this
is
a
compromise
under
the
statute
has
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
decided
by
any
other
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
will
be,
well
what
in
the
briefs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
which
this
statute
was
taken
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
new
york
cases
remitted
to
was
not
a
compromise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
are
asking
that
we
--
that
was
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
congress
adopted
from
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
should
give
the
same
interpretation
new
york
courts
had
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
that's
you
mean
if
there
is
a
finding
of
viability
and
an
award
of
10
percent
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,

the
employer
has
already
paid
compensation,
whether
he's
paying
it
pursuant
to
award
compensation
or
paying
without
an
award
compensation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
about
the
simply
under
ordinary
state
compensation,
frequently
employer
is
just
paying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
