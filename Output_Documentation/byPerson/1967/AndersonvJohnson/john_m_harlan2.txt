justice
john
m.
harlan
what
year
is
his
conviction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
might
be
irrelevant
but
what
is
the
estimation
in
15
years
lapsed
with
his
conviction
with
respect
to
the
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
--
in
the
tax
list
themselves,
is
there
any
differentiation
of
taxpayers
according
to
color?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
any
stage
of
the
selection
process,
are
there
such
list
where
color
is
due?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
he
said
--
he
knew
them.
that's
because
--
that's
why
he
could
identify
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whatever
he
said,
he
didn't
say
that
these
were
--
that
these
22
were
all
the
negroes
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
correct.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
i
have
attempted
to
continue
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
is
now
on
the
respondent
and
if
the
respondent
is
going
to
attempt
to
introduce
into
evidence
the
names
of
negroes
who
appeared
on
the
general
venire,
then
he
better
make
sure
that
he's
introducing
all
of
them
because
since
the
burden
is
on
him,
the
court
when
the
list
is
presented
to
it
has
really
no
alternative
but
to
assume
that
this
is
the
total
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
testimony
and
the
qualification.
i
agreed
fully
the
judge
did
not
state
that
this
was
all,
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
from
which
the
lower
courts
and
this
court
can
make
any
determination
of
how
many
negroes
there
were,
and
this
was
the
evidence
that
they
offered
to
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
now,
all
that
we
have
done
is
to
show
i
think
from
the
brief
using
elementary
probability
theory
that
this
evidence
proffered
to
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
it
has
no
such
a
thing.
that
the
probability
is
so
miniscule
that
it's
--
it
is
as
a
practical
matter
impossible.
but
for
22
to
have
been
selected
--
we
don't
know
how
many
were
selected.
all
we
are
trying
to
do
is
as
the
respondent
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
introduces
evidence
on
a
particular
point,
we
simply
attempt
to
meet
that
evidence
and
show
that
in
that
particular,
he
has
not
carried
his
burden.
and
so
it's
in
that
context
and
in
that
limited
context
that
our
use
of
the
probability
theory
with
respect
to
22
is
involved.
and
we
did
go
somewhat
further
and
that
is,
as
stated
earlier,
the
attorney
for
--
the
attorney
for
petitioner
in
his
trial
in
1949
who's
called
as
a
witness
by
respondent
stated
that
sometimes
two
and
sometimes
three
negroes
were
on
the
list
of
100
on
the
general
venire.
taking
the
maximum
number
that
he
stated
3%,
3
out
of
100.
we
again
applied
the
same
--
as
best
as
we
could,
we
took
their
proof
and
assumed
that
if
3%
were
on
the
list
of
hundred,
then
we
would
maximize
and
transfer
that
assumption
to
the
general
venire
and
assume
that
3%
were
on
the
general
venire.
and
this
would
result
in
45
instead
of
22
negroes
being
on
the
general
venire.
again,
we
don't
know
how
many
were
on
the
general
venire.
we
are
simply
attempting
to
meet
the
respondent
in
each
instance
where
he
tries
to
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
we
are
simply
trying
to
meet
this
evidence
and
show
that
the
evidence
in
fact
has
no
such
a
thing.
the
problem
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
also
--
it's
also
true
that
the
respondent
up
against
the
proposition
of
trying
to
reach
a
structured
situation
14
years
ago.
the
situation
is
created
by
--
whatever
the
reason
was,
the
failure
to
apply
this
petition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
unfair
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
probability
is
everything
else
that
are
interested
throughout
this
relevance
of
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
jones
case
decision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.

don't

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

is
it

and
that
has
been
reviewed
under

justice
john
m.

what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
year
is
his
conviction?
justice
john
m.

this
might
be

what
is
the

15

are

justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
he
said
--
he
knew
them.
that's
because
--
that's
why
he
could
identify
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whatever
he

he
didn't

that
