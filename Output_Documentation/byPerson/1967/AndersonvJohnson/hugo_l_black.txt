where
is
this
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
close
to
the
alabama
lines?
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
east
tennessee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
no
negro
had
ever
served
on
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
have
you
heard
the
case
of
patton
against
mississippi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'll
read
you
the
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
whatever
the
precise
number
of
qualified
appellate
in
the
county,
there
was
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
can
possibly
be
conceived
that
all
of
them
were
disqualified
for
jury
service
by
the
commission
of
crime,
did
to
the
government
gambling,
inability
to
read
and
write
or
to
meet
any
other
or
all
of
the
statutory
test,
we
do
not
doubt
that
the
state
could
have
approved
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
hold
that
the
state
wholly
failed
to
meet
the
very
strong
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
racial
discrimination
made
out
by
the
petitioner
for
the
uncontradicted
choice
that
for
30
years
or
more
no
negro
had
served
as
a
juror,
the
criminal
courts
of
lauderdale
county.
when
a
jury
selection
plan
or
whatever
it
is
operates
in
such
a
way
as
always
resulted
in
a
complete
and
long
continued
exclusion
of
any
evidence
of
a
large
group
of
negroes
in
any
other
racial
groups
indictments
and
verdict
is
turned
against
by
jurors
thus
selected
cannot
stand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
--
but
we
went
further
from
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
said
that
in
our
end
that
whatever
the
precise
number
of
qualified
electors
of
the
county
and
there
were
some.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
can
possibly
be
conceive
that
all
of
them
were
disqualified
for
jury
service
and
so
forth.
and
then
we
said,
i
just
hope
the
state
wholly
failed
to
meet
the
very
strong
evidence
of
purposeful
racial
discrimination
made
out
by
the
petitioner
on
uncontradicted
showing
for
30
years
or
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
negro
is
said
as
a
juror.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
that
happens
here,
the
convictions
didn't
stand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
prompted
any
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
this
was
based
on
was
that
none
have
served
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
a
period
of
30
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
none
had
served.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
not
see
that
difference
there?
suppose
they
did
called
some
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
the
judge
for
some
reason
excused
you
or
they
excused
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
excused
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
he
always
excuse
wouldn't
that
be
permanent
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
put
that
in
30
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
held
that
later
term?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
is
required
to
have
it
in
a
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
always
exclude
them
from
sitting
on
the
jury.
forget
the
fact
that
there
is
some
who
served.
that's
what
we've
tried
to
write
out
in
patton
against
mississippi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
imperfect
so
that
it
always
result
to
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
that's
not
it.
he
tells
him
you've
got
to
serve
one
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
30
years,
none
served.
what
does
that
mean
to
you
that
the
states
has
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
what
we've
said
is,
when
that
factor
is
shown,
the
states
got
to
make
strong
efforts
to
show
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
he
only
tried
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
they
have
shown
in
addition
to
this,
what
was
shown
here
that
every
term
of
court
during
the
entire
30
years,
10
negroes
had
been
summoned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
none
had
served.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
defense
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
there
not
be
for
30
years,
they
haven't
been
a
man
who
served.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
talk
of
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
that
you
think
that
every
employer
got
to
tell
the
event
they're
working
with.
they
couldn't
say
it
on
the
jury,
do
you?
that
would
not
be
a
farfetched
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it
wouldn't
be
a
state
action
if
that
had
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
proof
that
for
30
years
none
had
served.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
had
ever
happened
by
accident?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
judgment
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
what
happened
here,
isn't
it
but
they
have
two
every
time
of
three
every
time
and
none
of
them
ever
served.
that's
to
give
it
an
appearance
of
the
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
common
knowledge.
