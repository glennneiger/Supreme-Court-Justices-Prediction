mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
background
in
the
state
courts
that
would
point
toward
the
reason?
there
must
have
been
some
--
some
indication
of
when
the
first
attack
is
conviction
in
the
state
courts
other
than
on
appeal,
if
you
did
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
reed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
really
one
of
your
reasons
says
that
it
couldn't
be
enough
on
the
panel
to
the
hundred
because
they
didn't
put
enough
of
them
in
the
general
venire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
how
many
there
were,
except
this
affidavit
of
the
judge
who
says
that
the
court
has
no
recollection
how
many
--
of
how
many
--
if
any
negroes
were
drawn
from
the
jury
box
that
made
up
the
grand
trial
juries
for
the
may
of
1949
term
of
the
circuit
court.
and
then
--
then
you
said
though
however,
he
had
some
recollection
of
some
being
on
there
and
he
named
22.
he
said
--
so
therefore,
the
undersigned
personally
knows
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion
of
members
of
the
colored
race
from
jury
service
in
this
county
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
petitioner.
now,
that's
a
non-secular,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
there
were
any
more
than
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
in
a
county
of
this
size,
it
would
have
been
no
greater
to
burden
on
the
county
to
go
over
that
list
of
1,500
at
that
particular
time
and
determine
whether
they
were
colored
or
white,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
by
the
same
reason,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
an
indigent
defendant
in
jail
to
survey
that
whole
jury
system
and
concede
how
many
were
negroes
and
how
many
were
white.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
reed,
do
you
know
if
there
had
been
any
negro
served
on
a
grand
jury
or
a
petit
jury
since
this
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
evidence
to
what
extent
that
has
been
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
davies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
state
got
to
move
forward
with
its
abilities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
mr.
tomlinson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
from
the
counsel
that
since
this
trial,
negroes
have
served
on
the
juries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
to
what
extent
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
happen
--
one
sort
or
whether
it's
a
common
practice.
now,
you
could
tell
us
that
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
alright,
tell
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
present
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nashville.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
nashville.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
now
for
negroes
to
serve
criminal
juries
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
wonder
why
if
there
was
no
discrimination
at
the
time
of
this
man's
trial
and
before
that,
why
would
it
be
that
there
never
had
been
a
negro
that
served
on
the
jury
since
that
time
that
has
become
a
common
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yes
of
course.
whatever
answer
you
could
give
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
say
that
was
the
only
reason
or
the
fact
that
it
never
had
been
a
negro
served
on
either
grand
jury
or
petit
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
your
personal
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
urge
you
to
give.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
determining
what
happened
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
--
why
--
why
didn't
it
show
then
that
you
have
tested?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
when
the
states
appealing
with
magnitude
to
the
family
that
it
has
burden
to
show
such
facts
after
it
as
been
demonstrated
that
there
never
has
been
negro
on
the
jury
rather
than
to
put
that
burden
on
an
indigent
defendant
to
prove?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
as
justice
black's
reading
of
tomlinson
shows
that
the
state
does
have
a
burden
to
prove
that,
don't
you
think
that
it
should
do
that
much
at
least
and
not
compel
the
defendant
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
that
be
because
in
some
of
the
states,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
mississippi
or
not
but
it's
almost
impossible
for
a
negro
defendant
to
get
a
white
lawyer
to
raise
this
issue
that
that
has
been
demonstrated
to
us
here
on
a
case.
now,
it
won't
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
it
had
been
systematic
intrusion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
that's
the
time
we're
dealing
with
the
year
1949
and
not
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
make
any
difference
to
whoever
is
entitled
to
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
in
the
case?
