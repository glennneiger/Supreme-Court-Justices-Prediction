justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
i
gather
your
position
here
is
different,
or
isn't
it
than
it
was
in
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
lower
court
--
the
lower
court
didn't
--
or
the
court
below
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
this
issue
in
terms
of
you
having
attacking
it
and
the
other
side
supporting
it?
it
just
said
you
--
you
conceded
that
there
were
no
--
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
first
two
steps.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean?
what
do
you
use
in
regard
aside
from
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
use
--
it
is
better
to
show
what
it
goes
for
all
the
--
for
all
the
so-called
the
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
gone
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
direct
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
though
and
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
or
not
there
were
actually
drawn
with
the
petty
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
were,
whether
or
not
any
of
them
were
excused?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
have
been
500
others
as
far
as
he
knew.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
respect
where
the
law
hasn't
changed
in
three
years,
has
it
--
i
mean,
the
idea
of
making
a
prima
facie
case
with
the
fact
that
no
negroes
ever
serving
on
a
jury
plus
the
fact
that
a
certain
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
community,
that's
pretty
old
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
hardly
changing
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
fundamentally,
mr.
finklestein
can't
quite
get
to
the
--
nothing
that
he
says
quite
gets
around
to
--
to
dealing
with
the
situation
after
the
100
are
chosen
because
there
--
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
negroes
which
appear
on
out
of
the
100
might
not
end
up
on
the
jury.
so
really,
your
--
your
fundamental
target
at
this
part
of
your
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
most
there
will
meet
--
the
evidence
shows
there
were
only
three
negroes
that
ever
appeared
among
the
100
and
that's
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
number
of
negroes
in
the
community.
and
that
regardless
of
what
might
have
happened
to
the
negroes
on
the
--
out
of
the
hundred,
whether
there
were
three
or
20
after
that
regardless
of
what
might
have
happened
to
them,
they
were
in
the
--
on
the
--
out
of
the
hundred.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
understand
that,
but
your
big
--
your
big
argument
hinges
around
that
only
three
turned
up
on
the
hundred,
which
is
probably
the
best
evidence
of
how
many
there
were
among
the
1,500
because
that
was
a
random
selection.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
what
you're
really
hinging
your
prima
facie
case
on,
is
that
there
were
never
more
than
three
negroes
out
of
the
hundred.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
have
to
go
on
to
say
that
to
meet
the
evidence
that
the
negroes
role
is
excused
because
they
are
asked
to
be
excused.
now,
do
you
attack
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
the
judge
was
not
entitled
to
excuse
negroes
who
has
to
be
excused.
you're
saying
that
anyway,
his
excuse
was
rationally
motivated.
you
have
to
say
that,
don't
you?
let's
assume
that
there
were
20.
let's
assume
there
were
20
out
of
the
100
negroes.
there
were
always
20
but
none
ever
showed
up
on
the
jury.
you
would
still,
on
your
argument
i
assume,
say
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
with
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
would
not
be
sufficient
i
guess
explanation
by
the
state
to
put
the
judge
on
the
stand
and
say
i
always
excuse
negroes
who
ask
to
be
excused
that
they
always
ask
to
be
excused.
you
would
you
say
the
judge
was
motivated
by
racial
considerations.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
you
say
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
would
suppose
you
would
also
have
to
get
around
to
saying
that
that
the
peremptory
--
that
the
negroes
were
always
peremptory
challenged
that
too,
was
racially
motivated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
remember,
the
court
in
swain
didn't
say
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
disprove
racial
discrimination
in
peremptory
challenges.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
argument
of
this
is
whether
this
admitted
admission
that
binds
you,
the
question
is
whether
this
matter
is
within
our
jurisdiction
since
it
hasn't
been
passed
on
by
the
advisory
of
the
court
--
by
the
court
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
district
--
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
record
clear
the
no
negro
have
ever
been
selected
for
the
actual
theory
of
service
and
it
was
then
challenged?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
far
as
you
know,
there
may
have
been
--
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
their
may
have
been
negroes
actually
drawn
out
of
the
hundreds
that
served
on
the
petit
jury
and
he
wasn't
excused
but
he
was
challenged.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
citing
whitus?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there,
there
were
tax
rolls
remarks.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
discrimi
--
they
have
the
--
they
have
the
mechanism
before
them
where
on
which
they
could
easily
process
discrimination.
they
have
the
tax
list
mark,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
we
do
in
federal
criminal
cases
in
direct
review?
a
federal
criminal
case
tried
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let's
assume
it's
a
trial
of
the
court,
it
makes
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
think
happens
in
a
federal
criminal
case
when
it's
a
pretrial
hearing
on
--
to
exclude
some
evidence
as
having
been
unconstitutional
seized
and
the
district
judge
make
some
finding
and
it's
a
factual
determination
not
only
as
to
what
the
historical
facts
were
or
are
but
as
to
whether
these
facts
have
the
probable
cause
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
i
gather
your
position
here
is
different,
or
isn't
it
than
it
was
in
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
lower

--
the
lower

didn't

or
the

below
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to

it

there's
nothing

justice

what
do
you

what
do
you
use
in
regard
aside
from
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
use
--
it
is
better
to
show
what
it
goes
for
all
the
--
for
all
the
so-called
the
list?
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice

no?
justice
byron

all
gone

justice

he
had
direct
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
well,
i
understand
that

(inaudible).
justice
byron

white
but
though
and
the

doesn't
show
whether

justice
byron

and

it
is
hardly
changing
the

justice
byron

white
no,
but
--
justice
byron

white
fundamentally,
mr.

can't
quite
get
to
the
--
nothing
that
he

to

whether
there

after
that
regardless

they
were
in

on

is
that

and
you

you're
saying
that

you

don't
you?
let's
assume

let's

there

out

justice

white
and
that's
what
you
say
in
this

isn't
it?
justice
byron

white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron

white
and
i
would
suppose
you
would
also

let's

it's

what
do
you

you
