mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
respondent
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
if
you
will,
is
really
quite
easily
stated
on
whether
it's
so
easily
sustained,
i
believe
remains
to
be
the
same
and
the
position
is
this,
this
court
has
many,
many
times
been
called
to
pass
upon
jury
discrimination
cases.
but
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
all
but
one
of
the
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
because
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case.
in
many
of
the
cases
decided
previously
by
this
court,
the
court
has
said,
we
must
pay
great
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
facts
made
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
but,
we
also
have
to
make
our
own
determination
where
the
federal
question
is
involved.
the
only
other
federal
habeas
corpus
case
involving
discrimination
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
brown
verus
allen.
and
on
that
particular
point,
this
case
of
course
involved
many
points,
but
on
this
particular
point,
the
court
held
in
favor
of
the
convicting
authority.
now
in
this
case
then,
it's
my
conclusion
that
the
issue
is,
was
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
clearly
erroneous.
if
it
was
clearly
erroneous
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
52
(a)
them
this
court
must
reverse.
if
on
the
other
hand
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
finding
of
the
district
court
then
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
court
may
not
make
its
own
determination
as
to
the
federal
question
involved
but
must
sustain
the
determination
made
by
the
district
judge.
now
i
think
that
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
as
my
--
i
will
frankly
state
this.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
habeas
case
decided
by
this
court
where
this
particular
point
has
been
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
by
the
courts
--
federal
court
of
appeals
throughout
the
united
states
saying
that
52
(a)
is
applicable
and
if
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
from
the
state
view.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
based
on
the
decisions
of
federal
court
of
appeals.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
have
ever
been
called
upon
the
past
one
way
or
the
other
on
this
particular
point.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
this
does
not
come
under
rule
52
(a)
as
i
understand
it
because
juries
are
involved.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
i
still
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
where
a
jury
is
waived
and
the
district
judge
decided
the
case
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury,
you
frankly
called
me
on
the
way
as
i
do
not
know
the
answer
unless
it
is
controlled
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
think
from
the
term
of
your
question,
my
answer
is
obvious
that
you
make
the
federal
determinations
the
supreme
court
does
but
i
believe
that
his
is
the
distinguishing
point
here
because
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
not
apply
to
the
criminal
case
that
you've
just
discussed
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
answer
although
i
frankly
not
able
to
quote
to
you
verbatim
the
terms
of
the
statute
but
i
think
that
is
the
distinguishing
factor
because
this
is
a
civil
case
and
controlled
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
all
of
them
a
corrosive
criminal
procedure.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
of
course
then
i
believe
that
he
would
be
acting
in
a
“clearly
erroneous”
manner
under
the
law
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
a
like
--
right
lengthy
hearing,
the
matter
was
then
taken
under
advancement.
the
petitioners
counsel
was
given
an
opportunity
to
submit
interrogatories
or
take
affidavits
from
judge
ingram,
the
state
trial
judge
and
as
the
matter
of
fact
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
one
deposition
was
taken
subsequent
to
the
hearing
that
being
taken
by
me
of
the
then
sheriff
of
maury
county.
one
other
factor
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
this
that
this
case
has
changed
its
complexion
dramatically
since
it
was
tried
in
the
district
court.
there,
i
was
faced
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
with
some
15
as
i
recall,
different
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
running
the
gamut
from
failing
to
give
him
a
copy
of
his
indictment,
failing
in
giving
jury
list,
inadequacy
of
counsel,
everything
that
you
can
think
of
was
brought
into
the
court
as
well
as
the
only
question
as
before
the
court
here.
it
has
been
stated
that
the
reason
for
taking
mr.
tomlinson's
proof,
the
defense
counsel's
proof
was
purely
to
show
what
his
testimony
was
on
the
jury
discrimination
issue.
this
is
not
an
accurate
statement
because
this
is
the
lawyer
that
is
petitioned
--
that
the
petitioner
states
was
inadequate.
and
there
were
many
different
issues
that
these
witnesses
were
called
upon
to
testify
in
the
district
court.
now
further,
the
proof
in
the
district
court
was
this
and
if
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
created
it
is
this
case
that
after
the
respondent
was
called
upon
to
revert.
the
proof
was
this,
no
negro
had
sat
as
a
member
of
a
petit
jury
or
of
the
grand
jury
prior
to
the
petitioner's
trail
in
1946.
that
is
--
1949
i
believe.
that
is
correct.
because
we
have
no
proof
in
contrary
of
that.
further,
negroes
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
of
maury
county,
some
20%
i
believe.
third,
obviously,
some
weren't
qualified.
now,
the
petitioner
did
not
prove
that
some
were
qualified.
actually,
the
respondent
proved
that
some
were
qualified
because
the
respondent
put
on
the
proof
of
mr.
tomlinson
and
the
attorney
general
douglas
and
of
the
trial
judge
who
showed
by
their
testimony
that
some
were
qualified
or
else
it
would
never
be
in
the
jury
roles
if
they
weren't
qualified.
so
the
proof
was,
some
were
qualified.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
there
is
no
proof
and
was
no
proof
in
the
district
court
as
to
how
many
were
qualified,
if
your
honor
please,
because
of
this
and
i
don't
feel
that
it
is
the
respondent's
duty
to
prove
the
petitioner's
case.
the
petitioner,
i
feel
like
under
the
cases
has
got
to
prove
that
some
were
qualified
and
the
coleman
case
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
norris
case,
they
did
attempt
to
go
in
the
population
but
the
court
said,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we
know
at
least
that
30
were
qualified
and
none
ever
said,
state
you
then
have
got
the
burden
to
show
why
they
didn't
sit
or
as
in
the
district
court,
the
proof
was
some
were
qualified
and
the
respondents
proof
goes
on
to
show.
yes,
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called
every
single
time.
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called.
now,
the
use
of
the
word
prima
facie
in
my
opinion
has
confounded
this
whole
record.
and
i
frankly
don't
know
what
prima
facie
means
so
that
i
could
give
you
an
all
inclusive
definition
and
say
this
is
it.
now,
what
the
district
judge
held
as
i
understand
it
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well
judge,
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
where
the
word
is
used
as
to
what
it
means.
now,
may
i
explain
by
this?
if
after
the
petitioner
had
testified
and
i
reduce
the
testimony
of
mr.
martin
who
was
his
witness
from
maury
county,
tennessee,
if
at
that
time,
the
respondent
had
said
to
the
district
judge,
“i
am
not
going
to
put
on
a
broad
if
she
is
not
to
put
on
it
approved”.
and
the
judge
at
that
time
have
to
make
a
distinction
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prima
facie
case
have
been
proven,
his
decision
may
well
have
been
different
from
what
it
is
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
but
that
didn't
happen.
there
wasn't
any
motion
for
dismissal
at
the
end
of
the
petitioner's
case
or
in
any
of
this
major.
the
respondent
did
go
further.
the
respondent
did
put
on
proof
and
the
district
judge
held
this.
at
the
conclusion
of
all
of
the
testimony,
the
petitioner's
testimony
as
well
as
the
respondent's
testimony
and
considering
it
in
one
group,
i
find
that
the
petitioner
has
not
carried
a
prima
facie
case.
now
maybe
his
legalistic
reasoning
was
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
may
i
turn
to
my
notes
just
one
minute
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
and
may
i
comment
then
in
this
matter
on
patton
against
mississippi,
in
this
case,
they
showed
whether
or
not
you
were
an
elector
was
the
basic
qualification
for
jury
sir
and
they
show
that
there
were
25
negroes
who
were
qualified
electors
and
that
12
or
13
of
this
25
were
not
exempt
and
the
sheriff
came
in
and
testified,
this
means
that
if
i
bring
in
a
hundred
men
for
jury
service
that
i
must
bring
in
one-fourth
of
a
negro
because
of
the
one
percent.
and
i
can't
bring
in
more
than
one-fourth
of
a
negro
because
that
would
then
discriminate
against
white
people
and
that's
what
the
sheriff
testified
to
in
the
record
in
patton
against
mississippi
and
for
that
reason,
i
just
didn't
bring
in
any
and
the
court
said,
well,
some
were
qualified
and
you
didn't
put
any
on
your
own.
you
don't
have
any
here.
well,
unless
different
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
if
your
honor
please,
we
have
shown
in
this
case
that
some
were
called
for
jury
of
service
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
i
was
going
to
say
this
and
we
did
show
that
some
were
called
that
every
jury
terms
that
on
the
particular
general
jury
list
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
because
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
because
if
you
look
at
other
--
that's
what
happened
here.
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
say.
some
were
called
and
the
judge
according
to
this
record,
excused
those
who
came
before
him
and
said
i
wanted
to
be
excused
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
in
this
particular
case,
this
judge
was
on
since
1942.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
but
now,
is
he
required
to
say
no,
i'm
not
going
to
honor
your
excuse.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright
sir,
but
the
court
has
further
stated
that
just
because
the
system
maybe
imperfect,
there's
no
reason
to
show
that
the
state
has
failed.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
but
i
feel
that
it
is
just
as
unconstitutional
for
the
judge
to
tell
a
negro
that
you've
got
to
sit
on
this
jury
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
that
the
--
that
didn't
prove
to
me
just
honestly
that
the
state
has
done
anything
because
i
don't
know
why
these
negroes
do
not
want
to
serve.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
and
i
feel
that
in
this
case,
the
state
has
done
everything
it
could
do
to
prove
this
after
the
passage
of
some
15
years.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
three
jury
commissioners
who
were
commissioners
at
the
time
this
panel
was
selected.
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
hearing,
two
of
them
were
dead
and
the
third
man
was
90
years
old
and
too
old
to
attend
the
court.
that
was
one
problem
that
i
faced.
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
other
less
available
other
than
the
1,501
men
general
or
basic
jury
list.
now,
the
judge
looked
at
this
list
and
i
believe
that
his
affidavit
is
right
clear
as
to
what
he
said.
he
did
not
say,
i've
looked
at
it
carefully
and
these
are
the
only
negroes
on
the
list.
he
looked
at
it
and
said,
i
know
that
22
--
at
least
22
of
these
three
civil
districts
out
of
10
of
the
county
are
negro
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
then
we
must
come
up
with
a
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
why
none
have
served
and
our
explanation
is
that
they
have
not
served
because
the
judge
acted
upon
the
request
of
the
jurors
to
be
excused.
now,
if
that
explanation
is
not
satisfactory
then
that's
why
we're
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
satisfactory.
that
is
the
explanation
now
whether
or
not
it's
satisfactory
or
not.
it
depends
on
the
court
not
on
me.
but
that
is
this
explanation
given.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
defense.
and
the
state
further
says
that
one
--
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
of
any
hostile
attitude
toward
negroes
in
the
community.
but
even
if
there
were
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
not
enough
of
a
sociologist
just
to
know
why
they
don't
want
to
serve.
i've
got
enough
data
but
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
want
to
serve
sir.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
this
is
soon
that
there
was
a
hostile
community
attitude.
let's
say
that
all
of
the
employers
of
negroes
in
maury
county
says,
“if
you
serve
on
that
jury,
you
lose
your
job”
but
that's
not
the
state
action
in
my
opinion.
and
i
think
that
is
to
determine
the
point.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
i
don't
offer
this
to
the
defense
because
i
don't
think
i
have
to.
i
don't
think
we
got
to
that
point.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
have
gotten
to
this
point,
if
they
have
showed
a
hostile
community
attitude
as
they
have
intimated
in
the
record,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
defense
because
this
is
not
state
action.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
oh
yes,
sir.
that
could
be
a
farfetched
interest
but
i
was
still
above
the
same
token,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
state
action
and
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
of
any
body
else
coercing
this
people
or
anybody
coercing
these
people.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
would
say
not
if
you
ask
me
on
my
judgment.
i
would
say
not.
as
i
indicated
earlier
being
very
close
to
this
area,
i
suspect
i
know
why
they
didn't
serve
but
i
don't
think
this
is
state
action.
and
i
feel
like
the
judge
is
not
entitled
to
make
a
man
serve
because
he
is
a
negro
in
order
to
give
the
court
--
the
case
an
appearance
of
constitutionality
and
that's
what
he'd
be
doing.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
that
is
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
that
is
the
case
and
that
is
proven
then
i
feel
like
that's
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
in
regard
to
the
proof
of
this
record
as
to
how
many
appeared
at
each
term
on
the
hundred
men
jury
panel.
it
is
true
that
in
this
record,
mr.
tomlinson
did
state
more
or
less
casually
that
every
time
they
would
call
a
jury,
two
or
three
would
appear.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
mr.
tomlinson
is
--
pride
tomlinson,
jr.
was
a
son
of
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
who
was
the
defendant's
court
appointed
counsel
in
the
case.
now,
he
did
testify
this,
however,
looking
at
the
record,
the
reported
case
in
the
kennedy
case,
the
kennedy
case
is
the
one
that
i
was
been
alluded
to
by
the
petitioner
as
not
having
anybody
and
whatsoever
in
this
case.
now,
i
realize
that
the
kennedy
case
is
not
inclusive
in
this
court.
it's
not
binding
in
this
court.
i
do
think
it
can
be
persuasive
to
the
court.
one
reason
that
it
could
be
persuasive
on
this
court
is
because
in
1946,
when
the
kennedy
case
was
tried,
there
was
a
very
full
investigation
into
the
entire
jury
practices
in
maury
county
tennessee
some
1100
pages
of
the
record
were
devoted
to
this
one
part.
the
jury
commissioners
did
testify,
the
trial
judge
heard
their
testimony.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
ruled
an
opinion.
now,
in
that
case
there
was
a
proof
in
the
record
and
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
that
of
the
109
names
selected
for
jury
service
on
the
panel
at
which
kennedy
have
been
tried,
there
were
10
negroes.
of
the
59
actually
drawn
out
for
petit
jury
of
service
in
this
case,
there
were
four
negroes
which
is
a
different
figure
from
the
actual
figure
in
the
records
as
testified
to
by
mr.
pride
tomlinson.
if
your
honors
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
it's
the
first
that
i
know
of
with
the
exception
of
kennedy
in
which
certiorari
was
not
granted.
i
know
of
no
others.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
brown
versus
allen
was
from
south
carolina
--
from
the
north
carolina.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
know
of
none
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
know
of
other
juries
from
this
case
coming
from
tennessee.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
that's
not
in
the
record.
i
just
don't
know.
we
do
not
go
into
this
point
as
to
--
after
this
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
by
speaking
out
of
the
record,
i
can.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
think
it
is
common
practice
that
negroes
served
on
juries
throughout
the
state
of
tennessee
and
no
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
at
the
present
time.
i
know
in
davidson
county
that
there
are
negroes
serving
on
every
panel
and
i
can
--
and
i'll
start
to
say
that
i
have
never
tried
a
case
in
the
civil
courts
that
would
add
at
least
some
being
on
the
jury.
i
don't
think
that's
correct
but
i
could
almost
state
that
in
every
group
of
jurors
called
into
the
court
room
for
service
on
juries
there
would
be
some
negroes
in
the
panel
and
of
course,
the
population
of
davidson
county
is
much
greater
than
the
maury
county
--
that's
nashville
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
nashville.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
--
shall
be
counted
on.
i
just
don't
know
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
would
say
--
i
would
express
it
that
it
is
common
for
negroes
to
serve
on
jury.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
you
want
my
personal
opinion
on
this
sir?
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
suspect
that
it
is
the
same
reasoning
that
we
heard
in
the
mississippi
case
to
show
before
that
we
are
--
mississippi
is
not
the
only
state
that
has
been
guilty
of
not
having
his
house
in
order
and
but
slowly
but
surely
all
of
us
are
getting
our
houses
in
order
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
it
and
i
suspect
that
the
reason
that
negro
man
didn't
want
to
serve
on
juries
in
maury
county
because
they
felt
like
that
the
white
members
of
the
jury
didn't
want
them
on
the
jury
with
them.
that's
my
suspicion
and
i
suspect
that's
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
did
asked
to
be
excused
but
i
still
don't
see
that
that's
chargeable
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
could
not
state
but
that
was
the
only
reason.
in
fact,
the
record
did
show
that
the
reasons
given
to
the
trial
judge
would
vary.
some
would
be
from
employers
stating
that
this
man
is
my
employee
and
i
need
him
in
his
work
and
i
don't
want
him
in
jury.
others
would
say,
coming
on
their
own
but
after
they
say
i
need
it
at
my
work
just
to
interfere,
i
don't
want
to
serve
it.
according
to
mr.
tomlinson
i
believe
some
just
said
that
it
won't
serve
and
white
man
did
the
same
thing.
they
just
didn't
want
to
serve
and
the
judge
apparently
never
had
any
trouble
of
constituting
a
jury
and
he's
just
excused
as
i
feel
he
had
the
discretion
to
do
under
the
right
broad
authority
given
by
the
tennessee
statutes.
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
my
personal
opinion.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
personal
opinion
that
the
record
did
not
go
into
that.
now,
this
also
must
be
brought
out
that
the
census
report
which
does
show
the
number
of
adult
negro
males
was
not
before
the
district
court
but
was
introduced
into
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
petitioner
would
take
the
respondent
to
test
for
failing
then
to
come
in
and
show
what
percentage
of
this
were
not
qualified
and
my
answer
to
that
is
on
this
ground.
one,
why
and
how
do
you
go
about
proving
something
after
the
evidentiary
hearing
has
closed
other
than
by
stipulation.
two,
why
should
i
attempt
to
introduce
proof
on
an
issue
which
he
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals?
the
petitioner
did
concede
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
constitution
of
the
overall
jury
list.
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
why
should
i
come
in
and
prove
how
many
men
were
disqualified
in
the
composition
of
the
jury
in
order
to
make
up
the
jury
list
if
that's
not
an
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct
sir.
and
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
because
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioner
proved
only
that
--
through
cross
examination
of
my
witnesses
that
some
were
qualified.
and
to
revert
that,
i
approve
yes,
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called
every
term.
i
did
not
feel
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
go
further
than
that
neither
the
district
court
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
indigent
defendant
has
have
to
the
best
lawyers
that
i
know
of
representing
him
and
i
don't
feel
any
obligation
to
help
him
prove
his
case
very
frankly.
i
do
not.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
i
really
don't
feel
so.
i
feel
like
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding
regardless
of
this.
this
petitioner
had
witnesses
brought
up
here
from
columbia
know
of
no
reason
that
he
was
adversely
affected
because
of
lack
of
finances
and
anything
of
that
nature
and
of
now
reason
he
was
prejudice
on
that
regard.
the
court
instructed
him
as
to
--
if
you
wanted
to
take
additional
proof,
how
to
go
about
that,
they
just
want
any
--
in
my
opinion
no
prejudice
at
all
in
the
trial
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
marshalling
of
this
evidence
is
concerned.
i
frankly
feel
that
this
was
not
a
very
important
issue
in
the
district
court.
i
think
it
was
one
of
many
in
the
district
court.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
suspect
that
if
you
will
note
in
my
brief
that
i
stated
there
clearly,
i
did
not
take
the
position
that
this
man
had
waived
this
question
about
failing
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
because
there,
he
then
--
did
have
a
white
lawyer.
the
case
had
just
been
--
the
kennedy
case
had
just
been
decided.
it
would
have
been
fruitless
for
this
lawyer
to
have
raised
it.
and
i
make
no
question
about
a
waiver
in
this
case
because
it
was
just
an
intentional
packed
under
his
large
bar
but
there
is
no
--
i
can
state
categorically
that
he
has
no
difficulty
today
in
getting
a
white
lawyer
to
raise
the
questions
he
once
raised
if
i
might
state
this
that
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
attorney
general
staff
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
i'm
the
special
counsel
because
of
the
great
volume
of
these
cases
that
we
have
had
and
i've
represented
many
more
petitioners
than
i've
represented
the
respondent
and
i've
never
hesitated
to
raise
any
of
these
questions
whether
it
confused
the
trial
judge
of
misconduct
or
anything
else.
you
just
raise
them
and
do
the
best
you
can
and
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
problem
about
that
today
in
the
tennessee.
now,
again,
i
state
that
at
the
time
of
his
trial
there
may
have
been
some
problems
about
getting
mr.
tomlinson
to
raise
this
particular
issue
about
motion
to
quash
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
you
meant
today
was
he
having
any
trouble
of
getting
these
questions
presented
to
the
court.
and
my
answer
would
be
no.
it
is
not
today.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
in
1949,
i
suspect
that
he
could
have
had
some
problem
and
for
that
very
reason
that
i
did
not
insist
that
he'd
been
entitled
to
waive
at
that
time.
but
let's
take
this
in
regard
to
the
mathematical
argument
which
the
petitioner
have
now
advances.
i
do
not
feel
that
this
argument
is
valid
in
this
case
because
one,
there
is
no
proof
that
there
were
only
22
negroes
on
the
1501
jury
list.
there
was
no
proof
as
to
the
number
of
white
men
or
negro
men
on
the
tax
rolls
and
the
jury
list
were
taken
from
the
tax
rolls
and
there
is
no
distinction
on
the
tax
rolls
between
white
and
negro.
there's
no
distinction
on
the
jury
list
between
white
and
negro.
the
census
report
showing
the
breakdown
as
to
adult
males
was
not
before
the
district
court.
the
mathematician
came
up
with
all
these
figure
has
never
yet
testified.
i've
never
seen
him.
this
was
all
brought
in
to
the
record
even
after
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it.
actually,
it
was
not
in
the
record
that
brought
in
in
the
case.
and
at
this
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
discrimination
practice
in
the
composition
of
this
general
venire.
so
i
would
state
this
that
in
--
including
this
case
that
this
man
--
and
this
man
is
no
new
comer
to
the
criminal
law.
this
is
his
seventh
felony
conviction.
he's
been
in
the
penitentiary
since
1929
on
various
convictions.
he
knows
his
way
around
criminal
courts
and
yet
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
oh,
no
sir.
no,
certainly
not.
it
would
make
no
difference
there
but
it
does
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
it's
in
the
case
for
this
reason.
i
think
it
does
bear
weight
on
the
delay
that
this
man
has
years
in
bringing
the
case
to
the
attention
of
the
court
at
a
time
some
15
years
later
when
the
jury
commissioners,
the
man
who
really
knew
what
situation
were
before
their
first
hand
knowledge
would
be
it
or
to
held
and
come
to
court
and
i
think
that
does
have
some
bearing
on
the
case.
alright,
this
then
is
what
he
came
in
to
the
district
court
and
proved
as
i've
stated
again
and
again
that
some
none
served,
there
were
numerous
in
the
county,
some
were
qualified.
the
respondent
then
came
further
to
show
yes,
that
is
true
and
every
time
the
court
through
mr.
tomlinson
and
attorney
general
bumpus
and
the
trial
judge,
some
were
called
and
those
that
were
called
told
me
the
juries
that
didn't
want
to
serve
and
they
were
excused
for
that
reason.
now,
that's
the
explanation
of
the
state
and
that's
why
i
said
early,
it's
relatively
easy
to
state
now
whether
or
not
it's
so
easily
sustained
is
up
to
the
court
and
not
to
me
but
that
is
the
position
of
the
state.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
attention.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
respondent
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
if
you
will,
is
really
quite
easily
stated
on
whether
it's
so
easily
sustained,
i
believe
remains
to
be
the
same
and
the
position
is
this,
this
court
has
many,
many
times
been
called
to
pass
upon
jury
discrimination
cases.
but
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
all
but
one
of
the
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
because
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case.
in
many
of
the
cases
decided
previously
by
this
court,
the
court
has
said,
we
must
pay
great
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
facts
made
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
but,
we
also
have
to
make
our
own
determination
where
the
federal
question
is
involved.
the
only
other
federal
habeas
corpus
case
involving
discrimination
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
brown
verus
allen.
and
on
that
particular
point,
this
case
of
course
involved
many
points,
but
on
this
particular
point,
the
court
held
in
favor
of
the
convicting
authority.
now
in
this
case
then,
it's
my
conclusion
that
the
issue
is,
was
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
clearly
erroneous.
if
it
was
clearly
erroneous
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
52
(a)
them
this
court
must
reverse.
if
on
the
other
hand
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
finding
of
the
district
court
then
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
court
may
not
make
its
own
determination
as
to
the
federal
question
involved
but
must
sustain
the
determination
made
by
the
district
judge.
now
i
think
that
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
as
my
--
i
will
frankly
state
this.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
habeas
case
decided
by
this
court
where
this
particular
point
has
been
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
by
the
courts
--
federal
court
of
appeals
throughout
the
united
states
saying
that
52
(a)
is
applicable
and
if
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
from
the
state
view.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
based
on
the
decisions
of
federal
court
of
appeals.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
have
ever
been
called
upon
the
past
one
way
or
the
other
on
this
particular
point.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
this
does
not
come
under
rule
52
(a)
as
i
understand
it
because
juries
are
involved.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
i
still
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
where
a
jury
is
waived
and
the
district
judge
decided
the
case
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury,
you
frankly
called
me
on
the
way
as
i
do
not
know
the
answer
unless
it
is
controlled
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
think
from
the
term
of
your
question,
my
answer
is
obvious
that
you
make
the
federal
determinations
the
supreme
court
does
but
i
believe
that
his
is
the
distinguishing
point
here
because
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
not
apply
to
the
criminal
case
that
you've
just
discussed
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
answer
although
i
frankly
not
able
to
quote
to
you
verbatim
the
terms
of
the
statute
but
i
think
that
is
the
distinguishing
factor
because
this
is
a
civil
case
and
controlled
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
all
of
them
a
corrosive
criminal
procedure.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
of
course
then
i
believe
that
he
would
be
acting
in
a
“clearly
erroneous”
manner
under
the
law
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
a
like
--
right
lengthy
hearing,
the
matter
was
then
taken
under
advancement.
the
petitioners
counsel
was
given
an
opportunity
to
submit
interrogatories
or
take
affidavits
from
judge
ingram,
the
state
trial
judge
and
as
the
matter
of
fact
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
one
deposition
was
taken
subsequent
to
the
hearing
that
being
taken
by
me
of
the
then
sheriff
of
maury
county.
one
other
factor
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
this
that
this
case
has
changed
its
complexion
dramatically
since
it
was
tried
in
the
district
court.
there,
i
was
faced
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
with
some
15
as
i
recall,
different
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
running
the
gamut
from
failing
to
give
him
a
copy
of
his
indictment,
failing
in
giving
jury
list,
inadequacy
of
counsel,
everything
that
you
can
think
of
was
brought
into
the
court
as
well
as
the
only
question
as
before
the
court
here.
it
has
been
stated
that
the
reason
for
taking
mr.
tomlinson's
proof,
the
defense
counsel's
proof
was
purely
to
show
what
his
testimony
was
on
the
jury
discrimination
issue.
this
is
not
an
accurate
statement
because
this
is
the
lawyer
that
is
petitioned
--
that
the
petitioner
states
was
inadequate.
and
there
were
many
different
issues
that
these
witnesses
were
called
upon
to
testify
in
the
district
court.
now
further,
the
proof
in
the
district
court
was
this
and
if
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
created
it
is
this
case
that
after
the
respondent
was
called
upon
to
revert.
the
proof
was
this,
no
negro
had
sat
as
a
member
of
a
petit
jury
or
of
the
grand
jury
prior
to
the
petitioner's
trail
in
1946.
that
is
--
1949
i
believe.
that
is
correct.
because
we
have
no
proof
in
contrary
of
that.
further,
negroes
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
of
maury
county,
some
20%
i
believe.
third,
obviously,
some
weren't
qualified.
now,
the
petitioner
did
not
prove
that
some
were
qualified.
actually,
the
respondent
proved
that
some
were
qualified
because
the
respondent
put
on
the
proof
of
mr.
tomlinson
and
the
attorney
general
douglas
and
of
the
trial
judge
who
showed
by
their
testimony
that
some
were
qualified
or
else
it
would
never
be
in
the
jury
roles
if
they
weren't
qualified.
so
the
proof
was,
some
were
qualified.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
there
is
no
proof
and
was
no
proof
in
the
district
court
as
to
how
many
were
qualified,
if
your
honor
please,
because
of
this
and
i
don't
feel
that
it
is
the
respondent's
duty
to
prove
the
petitioner's
case.
the
petitioner,
i
feel
like
under
the
cases
has
got
to
prove
that
some
were
qualified
and
the
coleman
case
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
norris
case,
they
did
attempt
to
go
in
the
population
but
the
court
said,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we
know
at
least
that
30
were
qualified
and
none
ever
said,
state
you
then
have
got
the
burden
to
show
why
they
didn't
sit
or
as
in
the
district
court,
the
proof
was
some
were
qualified
and
the
respondents
proof
goes
on
to
show.
yes,
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called
every
single
time.
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called.
now,
the
use
of
the
word
prima
facie
in
my
opinion
has
confounded
this
whole
record.
and
i
frankly
don't
know
what
prima
facie
means
so
that
i
could
give
you
an
all
inclusive
definition
and
say
this
is
it.
now,
what
the
district
judge
held
as
i
understand
it
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well
judge,
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
where
the
word
is
used
as
to
what
it
means.
now,
may
i
explain
by
this?
if
after
the
petitioner
had
testified
and
i
reduce
the
testimony
of
mr.
martin
who
was
his
witness
from
maury
county,
tennessee,
if
at
that
time,
the
respondent
had
said
to
the
district
judge,
“i
am
not
going
to
put
on
a
broad
if
she
is
not
to
put
on
it
approved”.
and
the
judge
at
that
time
have
to
make
a
distinction
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prima
facie
case
have
been
proven,
his
decision
may
well
have
been
different
from
what
it
is
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
but
that
didn't
happen.
there
wasn't
any
motion
for
dismissal
at
the
end
of
the
petitioner's
case
or
in
any
of
this
major.
the
respondent
did
go
further.
the
respondent
did
put
on
proof
and
the
district
judge
held
this.
at
the
conclusion
of
all
of
the
testimony,
the
petitioner's
testimony
as
well
as
the
respondent's
testimony
and
considering
it
in
one
group,
i
find
that
the
petitioner
has
not
carried
a
prima
facie
case.
now
maybe
his
legalistic
reasoning
was
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
may
i
turn
to
my
notes
just
one
minute
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
and
may
i
comment
then
in
this
matter
on
patton
against
mississippi,
in
this
case,
they
showed
whether
or
not
you
were
an
elector
was
the
basic
qualification
for
jury
sir
and
they
show
that
there
were
25
negroes
who
were
qualified
electors
and
that
12
or
13
of
this
25
were
not
exempt
and
the
sheriff
came
in
and
testified,
this
means
that
if
i
bring
in
a
hundred
men
for
jury
service
that
i
must
bring
in
one-fourth
of
a
negro
because
of
the
one
percent.
and
i
can't
bring
in
more
than
one-fourth
of
a
negro
because
that
would
then
discriminate
against
white
people
and
that's
what
the
sheriff
testified
to
in
the
record
in
patton
against
mississippi
and
for
that
reason,
i
just
didn't
bring
in
any
and
the
court
said,
well,
some
were
qualified
and
you
didn't
put
any
on
your
own.
you
don't
have
any
here.
well,
unless
different
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
if
your
honor
please,
we
have
shown
in
this
case
that
some
were
called
for
jury
of
service
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
i
was
going
to
say
this
and
we
did
show
that
some
were
called
that
every
jury
terms
that
on
the
particular
general
jury
list
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
because
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
because
if
you
look
at
other
--
that's
what
happened
here.
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
say.
some
were
called
and
the
judge
according
to
this
record,
excused
those
who
came
before
him
and
said
i
wanted
to
be
excused
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
in
this
particular
case,
this
judge
was
on
since
1942.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
but
now,
is
he
required
to
say
no,
i'm
not
going
to
honor
your
excuse.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright
sir,
but
the
court
has
further
stated
that
just
because
the
system
maybe
imperfect,
there's
no
reason
to
show
that
the
state
has
failed.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
but
i
feel
that
it
is
just
as
unconstitutional
for
the
judge
to
tell
a
negro
that
you've
got
to
sit
on
this
jury
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
that
the
--
that
didn't
prove
to
me
just
honestly
that
the
state
has
done
anything
because
i
don't
know
why
these
negroes
do
not
want
to
serve.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
and
i
feel
that
in
this
case,
the
state
has
done
everything
it
could
do
to
prove
this
after
the
passage
of
some
15
years.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
three
jury
commissioners
who
were
commissioners
at
the
time
this
panel
was
selected.
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
hearing,
two
of
them
were
dead
and
the
third
man
was
90
years
old
and
too
old
to
attend
the
court.
that
was
one
problem
that
i
faced.
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
other
less
available
other
than
the
1,501
men
general
or
basic
jury
list.
now,
the
judge
looked
at
this
list
and
i
believe
that
his
affidavit
is
right
clear
as
to
what
he
said.
he
did
not
say,
i've
looked
at
it
carefully
and
these
are
the
only
negroes
on
the
list.
he
looked
at
it
and
said,
i
know
that
22
--
at
least
22
of
these
three
civil
districts
out
of
10
of
the
county
are
negro
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
then
we
must
come
up
with
a
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
why
none
have
served
and
our
explanation
is
that
they
have
not
served
because
the
judge
acted
upon
the
request
of
the
jurors
to
be
excused.
now,
if
that
explanation
is
not
satisfactory
then
that's
why
we're
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
satisfactory.
that
is
the
explanation
now
whether
or
not
it's
satisfactory
or
not.
it
depends
on
the
court
not
on
me.
but
that
is
this
explanation
given.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
defense.
and
the
state
further
says
that
one
--
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
of
any
hostile
attitude
toward
negroes
in
the
community.
but
even
if
there
were
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
not
enough
of
a
sociologist
just
to
know
why
they
don't
want
to
serve.
i've
got
enough
data
but
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
want
to
serve
sir.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
this
is
soon
that
there
was
a
hostile
community
attitude.
let's
say
that
all
of
the
employers
of
negroes
in
maury
county
says,
“if
you
serve
on
that
jury,
you
lose
your
job”
but
that's
not
the
state
action
in
my
opinion.
and
i
think
that
is
to
determine
the
point.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
i
don't
offer
this
to
the
defense
because
i
don't
think
i
have
to.
i
don't
think
we
got
to
that
point.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
have
gotten
to
this
point,
if
they
have
showed
a
hostile
community
attitude
as
they
have
intimated
in
the
record,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
defense
because
this
is
not
state
action.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
oh
yes,
sir.
that
could
be
a
farfetched
interest
but
i
was
still
above
the
same
token,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
state
action
and
i
think
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
but
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
of
any
body
else
coercing
this
people
or
anybody
coercing
these
people.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
would
say
not
if
you
ask
me
on
my
judgment.
i
would
say
not.
as
i
indicated
earlier
being
very
close
to
this
area,
i
suspect
i
know
why
they
didn't
serve
but
i
don't
think
this
is
state
action.
and
i
feel
like
the
judge
is
not
entitled
to
make
a
man
serve
because
he
is
a
negro
in
order
to
give
the
court
--
the
case
an
appearance
of
constitutionality
and
that's
what
he'd
be
doing.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
that
is
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
if
that
is
the
case
and
that
is
proven
then
i
feel
like
that's
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
in
regard
to
the
proof
of
this
record
as
to
how
many
appeared
at
each
term
on
the
hundred
men
jury
panel.
it
is
true
that
in
this
record,
mr.
tomlinson
did
state
more
or
less
casually
that
every
time
they
would
call
a
jury,
two
or
three
would
appear.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
mr.
tomlinson
is
--
pride
tomlinson,
jr.
was
a
son
of
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
who
was
the
defendant's
court
appointed
counsel
in
the
case.
now,
he
did
testify
this,
however,
looking
at
the
record,
the
reported
case
in
the
kennedy
case,
the
kennedy
case
is
the
one
that
i
was
been
alluded
to
by
the
petitioner
as
not
having
anybody
and
whatsoever
in
this
case.
now,
i
realize
that
the
kennedy
case
is
not
inclusive
in
this
court.
it's
not
binding
in
this
court.
i
do
think
it
can
be
persuasive
to
the
court.
one
reason
that
it
could
be
persuasive
on
this
court
is
because
in
1946,
when
the
kennedy
case
was
tried,
there
was
a
very
full
investigation
into
the
entire
jury
practices
in
maury
county
tennessee
some
1100
pages
of
the
record
were
devoted
to
this
one
part.
the
jury
commissioners
did
testify,
the
trial
judge
heard
their
testimony.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
ruled
an
opinion.
now,
in
that
case
there
was
a
proof
in
the
record
and
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
that
of
the
109
names
selected
for
jury
service
on
the
panel
at
which
kennedy
have
been
tried,
there
were
10
negroes.
of
the
59
actually
drawn
out
for
petit
jury
of
service
in
this
case,
there
were
four
negroes
which
is
a
different
figure
from
the
actual
figure
in
the
records
as
testified
to
by
mr.
pride
tomlinson.
if
your
honors
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
it's
the
first
that
i
know
of
with
the
exception
of
kennedy
in
which
certiorari
was
not
granted.
i
know
of
no
others.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
brown
versus
allen
was
from
south
carolina
--
from
the
north
carolina.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
know
of
none
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
know
of
other
juries
from
this
case
coming
from
tennessee.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
that's
not
in
the
record.
i
just
don't
know.
we
do
not
go
into
this
point
as
to
--
after
this
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
by
speaking
out
of
the
record,
i
can.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
alright,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
think
it
is
common
practice
that
negroes
served
on
juries
throughout
the
state
of
tennessee
and
no
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
at
the
present
time.
i
know
in
davidson
county
that
there
are
negroes
serving
on
every
panel
and
i
can
--
and
i'll
start
to
say
that
i
have
never
tried
a
case
in
the
civil
courts
that
would
add
at
least
some
being
on
the
jury.
i
don't
think
that's
correct
but
i
could
almost
state
that
in
every
group
of
jurors
called
into
the
court
room
for
service
on
juries
there
would
be
some
negroes
in
the
panel
and
of
course,
the
population
of
davidson
county
is
much
greater
than
the
maury
county
--
that's
nashville
sir.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
nashville.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
--
shall
be
counted
on.
i
just
don't
know
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
would
say
--
i
would
express
it
that
it
is
common
for
negroes
to
serve
on
jury.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
you
want
my
personal
opinion
on
this
sir?
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
suspect
that
it
is
the
same
reasoning
that
we
heard
in
the
mississippi
case
to
show
before
that
we
are
--
mississippi
is
not
the
only
state
that
has
been
guilty
of
not
having
his
house
in
order
and
but
slowly
but
surely
all
of
us
are
getting
our
houses
in
order
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
it
and
i
suspect
that
the
reason
that
negro
man
didn't
want
to
serve
on
juries
in
maury
county
because
they
felt
like
that
the
white
members
of
the
jury
didn't
want
them
on
the
jury
with
them.
that's
my
suspicion
and
i
suspect
that's
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
did
asked
to
be
excused
but
i
still
don't
see
that
that's
chargeable
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
i
could
not
state
but
that
was
the
only
reason.
in
fact,
the
record
did
show
that
the
reasons
given
to
the
trial
judge
would
vary.
some
would
be
from
employers
stating
that
this
man
is
my
employee
and
i
need
him
in
his
work
and
i
don't
want
him
in
jury.
others
would
say,
coming
on
their
own
but
after
they
say
i
need
it
at
my
work
just
to
interfere,
i
don't
want
to
serve
it.
according
to
mr.
tomlinson
i
believe
some
just
said
that
it
won't
serve
and
white
man
did
the
same
thing.
they
just
didn't
want
to
serve
and
the
judge
apparently
never
had
any
trouble
of
constituting
a
jury
and
he's
just
excused
as
i
feel
he
had
the
discretion
to
do
under
the
right
broad
authority
given
by
the
tennessee
statutes.
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that
is
my
personal
opinion.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
personal
opinion
that
the
record
did
not
go
into
that.
now,
this
also
must
be
brought
out
that
the
census
report
which
does
show
the
number
of
adult
negro
males
was
not
before
the
district
court
but
was
introduced
into
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
petitioner
would
take
the
respondent
to
test
for
failing
then
to
come
in
and
show
what
percentage
of
this
were
not
qualified
and
my
answer
to
that
is
on
this
ground.
one,
why
and
how
do
you
go
about
proving
something
after
the
evidentiary
hearing
has
closed
other
than
by
stipulation.
two,
why
should
i
attempt
to
introduce
proof
on
an
issue
which
he
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals?
the
petitioner
did
concede
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
constitution
of
the
overall
jury
list.
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
why
should
i
come
in
and
prove
how
many
men
were
disqualified
in
the
composition
of
the
jury
in
order
to
make
up
the
jury
list
if
that's
not
an
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
ed
r.
davies
that's
correct
sir.
and
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
because
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioner
proved
only
that
--
through
cross
examination
of
my
witnesses
that
some
were
qualified.
and
to
revert
that,
i
approve
yes,
some
were
qualified
and
some
were
called
every
term.
i
did
not
feel
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
go
further
than
that
neither
the
district
court
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
indigent
defendant
has
have
to
the
best
lawyers
that
i
know
of
representing
him
and
i
don't
feel
any
obligation
to
help
him
prove
his
case
very
frankly.
i
do
not.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
no,
sir.
i
really
don't
feel
so.
i
feel
like
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding
regardless
of
this.
this
petitioner
had
witnesses
brought
up
here
from
columbia
know
of
no
reason
that
he
was
adversely
affected
because
of
lack
of
finances
and
anything
of
that
nature
and
of
now
reason
he
was
prejudice
on
that
regard.
the
court
instructed
him
as
to
--
if
you
wanted
to
take
additional
proof,
how
to
go
about
that,
they
just
want
any
--
in
my
opinion
no
prejudice
at
all
in
the
trial
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
marshalling
of
this
evidence
is
concerned.
i
frankly
feel
that
this
was
not
a
very
important
issue
in
the
district
court.
i
think
it
was
one
of
many
in
the
district
court.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
suspect
that
if
you
will
note
in
my
brief
that
i
stated
there
clearly,
i
did
not
take
the
position
that
this
man
had
waived
this
question
about
failing
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
because
there,
he
then
--
did
have
a
white
lawyer.
the
case
had
just
been
--
the
kennedy
case
had
just
been
decided.
it
would
have
been
fruitless
for
this
lawyer
to
have
raised
it.
and
i
make
no
question
about
a
waiver
in
this
case
because
it
was
just
an
intentional
packed
under
his
large
bar
but
there
is
no
--
i
can
state
categorically
that
he
has
no
difficulty
today
in
getting
a
white
lawyer
to
raise
the
questions
he
once
raised
if
i
might
state
this
that
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
attorney
general
staff
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
i'm
the
special
counsel
because
of
the
great
volume
of
these
cases
that
we
have
had
and
i've
represented
many
more
petitioners
than
i've
represented
the
respondent
and
i've
never
hesitated
to
raise
any
of
these
questions
whether
it
confused
the
trial
judge
of
misconduct
or
anything
else.
you
just
raise
them
and
do
the
best
you
can
and
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
problem
about
that
today
in
the
tennessee.
now,
again,
i
state
that
at
the
time
of
his
trial
there
may
have
been
some
problems
about
getting
mr.
tomlinson
to
raise
this
particular
issue
about
motion
to
quash
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
you
meant
today
was
he
having
any
trouble
of
getting
these
questions
presented
to
the
court.
and
my
answer
would
be
no.
it
is
not
today.
mr.
ed
r.
davies
in
1949,
i
suspect
that
he
could
have
had
some
problem
and
for
that
very
reason
that
i
did
not
insist
that
he'd
been
entitled
to
waive
at
that
time.
but
let's
take
this
in
regard
to
the
mathematical
argument
which
the
petitioner
have
now
advances.
i
do
not
feel
that
this
argument
is
valid
in
this
case
because
one,
there
is
no
proof
that
there
were
only
22
negroes
on
the
1501
jury
list.
there
was
no
proof
as
to
the
number
of
white
men
or
negro
men
on
the
tax
rolls
and
the
jury
list
were
taken
from
the
tax
rolls
and
there
is
no
distinction
on
the
tax
rolls
between
white
and
negro.
there's
no
distinction
on
the
jury
list
between
white
and
negro.
the
census
report
showing
the
breakdown
as
to
adult
males
was
not
before
the
district
court.
the
mathematician
came
up
with
all
these
figure
has
never
yet
testified.
i've
never
seen
him.
this
was
all
brought
in
to
the
record
even
after
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it.
actually,
it
was
not
in
the
record
that
brought
in
in
the
case.
and
at
this
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
discrimination
practice
in
the
composition
of
this
general
venire.
so
i
would
state
this
that
in
--
including
this
case
that
this
man
--
and
this
man
is
no
new
comer
to
the
criminal
law.
this
is
his
seventh
felony
conviction.
he's
been
in
the
penitentiary
since
1929
on
various
convictions.
he
knows
his
way
around
criminal
courts
and
yet
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
oh,
no
sir.
no,
certainly
not.
it
would
make
no
difference
there
but
it
does
--
mr.
ed
r.
davies
well,
it's
in
the
case
for
this
reason.
i
think
it
does
bear
weight
on
the
delay
that
this
man
has
years
in
bringing
the
case
to
the
attention
of
the
court
at
a
time
some
15
years
later
when
the
jury
commissioners,
the
man
who
really
knew
what
situation
were
before
their
first
hand
knowledge
would
be
it
or
to
held
and
come
to
court
and
i
think
that
does
have
some
bearing
on
the
case.
alright,
this
then
is
what
he
came
in
to
the
district
court
and
proved
as
i've
stated
again
and
again
that
some
none
served,
there
were
numerous
in
the
county,
some
were
qualified.
the
respondent
then
came
further
to
show
yes,
that
is
true
and
every
time
the
court
through
mr.
tomlinson
and
attorney
general
bumpus
and
the
trial
judge,
some
were
called
and
those
that
were
called
told
me
the
juries
that
didn't
want
to
serve
and
they
were
excused
for
that
reason.
now,
that's
the
explanation
of
the
state
and
that's
why
i
said
early,
it's
relatively
easy
to
state
now
whether
or
not
it's
so
easily
sustained
is
up
to
the
court
and
not
to
me
but
that
is
the
position
of
the
state.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
attention.
