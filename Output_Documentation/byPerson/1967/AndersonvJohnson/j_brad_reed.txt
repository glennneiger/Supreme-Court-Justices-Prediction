mr.
j.
brad
reed
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
negro.
the
petitioner
was
indicted,
tried
and
convicted
in
maury
county,
tennessee
in
1949
for
the
offense
of
rape.
he
contends
in
this
case
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
from
the
petty
jury
which
tried
and
convicted
him.
the
salient
facts
in
the
case
are
wholly
undisputed.
the
census
reports
from
maury
county
were
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
district
court.
they
showed
that
in
excess
of
20%
of
the
total
population
of
maury
county,
at
all
relevant
times,
were
negro.
the
proof
also
showed
without
dispute
that
prior
to
and
including
the
time
of
petitioner's
indictment,
trial
and
conviction,
no
negro,
none
whatever
had
ever
served
on
any
grand
or
petty
jury
in
maury
county.
there's
absolutely
no
question
and
i
would
hardly
even
think
it
necessary
to
mention
it
if
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
district
court
held
otherwise
that
these
two
items
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion
showing
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
population
to
be
negro
and
showing
an
absolute
failure
of
service
at
any
time
on
the
part
of
negroes.
as
stated,
the
district
court
nevertheless
held
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
his
conviction
was
in
1949,
your
honor.
his
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court
was
in
1964.
the
case
of
norris
versus
alabama
i
think
is
completely
determinative
of
this
point
of
the
prima
facie
case.
the
case
quite
somewhat
similar
in
all
respects
except
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
jackson
county,
alabama
was
much,
much
smaller.
this
is
294
u.s.
590
showing
about
8%
of
the
population
to
be
negro,
on
591
showing
that
there
had
never
been
any
service
by
negroes
on
grand
or
petty
jury
and
the
court
then
states
that
testimony
in
itself
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
the
denial
of
the
equal
protection
which
the
constitution
guarantees.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
have
no
explanation
for
it.
i
was
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
for
the
first
time
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
--
i
have
no
idea
why
the
petition
was
not
filed
earlier.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
there
was
no
appeal.
i'm
not
advised,
your
honor,
as
to
when
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
state
court
on
this
basis.
mr.
davies
informed
me
that
it
was
in
1962.
i
have
an
idea
as
to
perhaps
why
the
challenge
was
not
previously
made.
of
course,
it
was
around
that
time
that
habeas
corpus
became
--
that
the
use
of
the
writ
became
prevalent
and
it
kind
of
enters
throughout
the
country.
also,
mr.
davies
relies
heavily,
and
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
his
reliance
is
misplaced
on
a
tennessee
supreme
court
decision
concerning
a
prior
conviction
in
maury
county
some
two
years
prior
to
the
--
i
suppose
three
years
prior
to
the
petitioner's
indictment
and
conviction
in
which
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion
was
raised,
proof
was
taken
and
the
court
held
that
systematic
exclusion
had
not
been
proved.
certiorari
was
sought
in
this
court
and
denied.
i
think
that
i
will
be
able
to
convince
the
court
that
the
questions
asked
and
the
reasoning
employed
by
the
tennessee
court
in
that
case
were
erroneous
and
that
the
--
that
the
facts
presented
in
the
case
was
erroneously
decided.
nevertheless,
this
case
--
this
court
did
not
choose
to
review
the
case
at
that
time
and
this
may
have
had
some
inhibiting
effect
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
the
decision
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
was
in
1949.
the
array
of
the
grand
and
petty
jury
that
was
challenged
was
in
1946.
i
am
--
i'm
speaking
strictly
on
the
record,
your
honor,
expressing
interest
in
--
and
i
would
guess
that
was
--
that
was
what
it
is
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
davies
will
--
will
say
that's
what
it
is.
at
any
rate,
on
the
decisions
beginning
with
norris
which
was
in
19
--
in
35
through
patton
versus
mississippi
in
47,
whitus
decided
last
term
and
coleman
versus
alabama
decided
this
time.
petitioner
clearly
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
shifted
the
burden,
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
respondent
to
prove
that
what
the
introduce
evidence
to
the
fact
that
negroes
had
not
been
systemically
excluded.
the
respondent's
first
attempt
to
show
no
systematic
exclusion
was
to
say
that
petitioner
had
not
shown
that
any
negroes
were
qualified
for
jury
service.
well,
in
the
first
place,
respondent
misconstrues
the
nature
of
the
prima
facie
case.
the
burden
is
shifted
to
him
to
introduce
evidence
to
the
effect
that
negroes
are
not
qualified.
the
prima
facie
case
has
already
been
established.
it's
very
clear
under
norris
and
the
later
decisions
that
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
out
by
showing
a
substantial
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
population,
not
--
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
negroes
aren't
qualified
for
jury
service.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
maury
county,
your
honor.
it's
south
of
nashville.
it's
in
southern
central
tennessee.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
i
would
estimate
40
miles
from
alabama.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
it's
right
in
the
middle
of
tennessee
but
in
the
southern
portion
of
middle
tennessee.
the
respondent
introduced
the
statutes
setting
forth
the
relevant
qualifications
for
jurors
which
were
fairly
usual
for
this
time
which
was
20
years
ago.
they
have
since
been
changed
but
the
qualifications
set
forth
by
the
tennessee
statutes
--
and
this
--
this
is
set
forth
in
--
in
our
brief.
it's
a
combination
of
the
general
statute
and
the
private
act,
which
applied
only
to
maury
county.
adult,
male
freeholders
or
householders
and
upright
intelligent
men
known
for
their
integrity,
fair
character
and
sound
judgment.
respondent
introduced
no
proof
whatever
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
adult
males
as
compared
with
white
adult
males
than
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
general
population.
respondent
introduced
no
proof
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
whites
were
freeholders
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
were
white
--
were
householders
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
were
upright
intelligent
men
known
for
their
integrity,
fair
character
and
sound
judgment.
so
it's
our
contention
that
the
respondent
has
wholly
failed
in
his
attempt
to
carry
the
burden
of
showing
that
fewer
negroes
than
--
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
those
in
the
general
population
which
was
in
excess
of
20%
were
eligible
for
jury
service.
respondent
introduced
proof
that
the
jurors
were
selected
from
the
tax
rolls
but
again
introduced
no
evidence
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
the
20%
in
the
general
population
were
taxpayers.
the
court
has
no
evidence
therefore
on
which
to
base
any
finding
except
that
in
excess
of
20%
of
those
persons
eligible
for
jury
duty
were
negroes.
respondent
or
rather
petitioner
was
not
satisfied
with
relying
solely
on
the
respondent's
failure
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
so
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
possible
at
that
time,
we
attempted
to
show
that
the
result
gained
by
respondent's
failure
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
fact
the
correct
result
in
this
panel.
we
introduced
by
agreement
the
sub-census
i
suppose
you
would
call
it,
breaking
down
the
population
figures
from
the
total
population
into
adult
male
negroes
and
adult
male
whites,
which
is
the
largest
category
under
the
jury
qualification
statute.
this
showed,
as
you
might
guess,
that
again
in
excess
of
20%
of
all
adult
males
in
maury
county
were
negroes.
then
--
and
this
is
found
in
our
brief
in
footnote
1
an
examination
of
the
tennessee
authorities
as
to
what
a
person
had
to
be
in
order
to
constitute
a
householder.
an
adult
male
householder
unquestionably
is
qualified
for
jury
service.
the
only
way
to
determine
how
many
freeholders
there
were
would
be
to
go
to
the
tax
records.
this
was
respondent's
responsibility
and
he
did
not
carry
it.
we
examined
the
tennessee
authorities
in
detail
and
it
set
this
forth
in
the
brief
to
show
that
virtually
all
adult
males
are
householders
under
the
tennessee
law,
and
i
won't
belabor
the
point
by
discussing
it
here,
but
it's
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
brief.
so
--
so
they're
not
being
satisfied
to
rely
wholly
on
the
burden
of
proof.
petitioner
weren't
here
and
went
forward
himself
and
showed
that
--
that
in
fact
an
excess
of
20%
of
those
persons
eligible
for
jury
duty
were
negroes.
and
we
think
that
the
courts
below
and
this
court
have
no
evidence
to
base
any
finding
other
than
that.
respondent
next
attempted
to
rebut
petitioner's
prima
facie
case
and
i
may
state
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
contrary
to
the
district
court
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
out
but
held
that
respondent
had
rebutted
that
case
successfully.
they
--
in
doing
so,
they
relied
upon
the
elements
which
i
will
discuss
important
and
important
for
us.
what
was
the
nature
of
respondent's
rebuttal
evidence
with
respect
to
selection?
well,
as
a
background,
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
briefly
discuss
the
method
by
which
jurors
are
selected
in
maury
county.
first,
the
circuit
judge
appoints
jury
commissioners.
these
commissioners
then
biannually
select
from
whatever
source
they
use
and
there
was
evidence
of
the
tax
books
we
use
but
again,
no
evidence
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
then
in
the
general
population
were
property
owners.
they
select
a
large
list
which
is
known
as
the
general
venire.
these
lists
for
the
particular
general
venire
are
from
which
the
juries
that
indicted
and
convicted
petitioner
was
selected
consisting
of
1,501
persons.
this
list
was
used
for
a
two-year
period
and
from
this
list
before
every
term
of
court,
three
times
each
year,
they
were
selected
by
a
--
the
names
of
all
1,501
were
placed
on
individual
slips
of
paper.
before
each
term
a
boy,
member
as
ten
years
of
age
drew
a
hundred
or
approximately
a
hundred
names
out
of
the
box
in
which
these
1,501
names
were
placed.
and
that
list
of
100
is
called
the
venire
facias.
obviously,
we
have
no
complaint
about
the
method
of
selection.
they
are
completely
at
random.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
with
the
differentiation?
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
not
the
--
the
record
shows
there
is
none.
if
i
may
comment
on
that,
the
respondent
attempts
to
use
this
in
a
way
which
i
think
the
court
will
see
to
be
clearly
impermissible.
respondent
says
--
well,
the
jury
commissioners
were
honest
men
and
they
only
selected
a
few
negroes.
therefore,
there
could
be
only
a
few
negroes
who
were
property
owners.
there
could
be
only
a
few
who
are
on
the
tax
list.
of
course,
the
basic
assumption
to
that
line
of
reasoning
is
the
impermissible
assumption
that
the
jury
commissioners
performed
their
duty
in
a
--
in
a
manner
which
did
not
discriminate.
this
is
the
--
and
this
is
the
contention
that's
raised
in
every
systematic
exclusion
case.
well
gee,
the
jury
commissioners
were
honest,
upright
men
and
they
knew
they
weren't
supposed
to
discriminate.
and
for
that
reason,
we'll
presume
that
they
didn't
discriminate
and
we'll
find
those
systematic
exclusions
that
this
court
is
throwing
out
and
paid
no
attention
to
that
contention
every
time
it
has
been
raised.
so
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
will
--
will
decline
to
accept
the
respondent's
invitation
to
--
to
use
that
reasoning
in
this
case.
from
the
venire
facias
of
100
names
for
a
relatively
brief
period
of
time
of
a
couple
of
weeks,
those
persons
are
notified
and
then
the
judge
entertains
request
for
excusal
from
service.
these
are
granted
or
denied
and
then
the
remaining
jurors
form
the
final
venire
facias
from
which
grand
jurors
are
selected.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
--
one
persons
who
make
up
the
biennial
general
venire
from
that
list,
there
are
selected
three
times
a
year
admittedly
at
random
approximately
100
names.
these
persons,
after
request
for
excusal
have
been
ruled
on
by
the
circuit
judge
composed
of
final
venire
facias,
and
then
immediately
upon
the
beginning
of
each
term,
there
are
selected
from
this
list
again
admittedly
at
random.
the
first
13
names
drawn
from
the
list
compose
the
grand
jury
and
then
from
the
remaining
names
are
selected
the
petty
juries
for
the
trials
of
cases
during
the
term.
there
are
four
distinct
steps
in
the
selection
process.
the
first
is
the
selection
by
the
jury
commissioners
of
the
general
venire.
it
is
this
step
which
--
with
which
we
are
extremely
concerned
right
now.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
different
from
what
it
was
in
the
court
below
and
the
respondent
has
challenged
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
change
his
position
at
this
time
because
you
raised
the
question
on
i
think
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
great
characterization
of
what
the
court
said.
the
--
our
position
in
no
way
changes
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
facts
are
the
same
as
they
were
in
the
court
below.
perhaps
the
best
explanation
is
one
of
the
passage
of
time.
the
brief
which
was
written
by
the
petitioner
who
was
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
written
in
1965.
the
court
will
recall
that
at
that
time
to
a
certain
extent,
the
decisions
were
perhaps
characterized
as
an
imbroglio
from
brown
versus
allen,
speller
versus
allen
just
before
the
time
the
debrief
was
found,
swain
versus
alabama
where
there
had
been
a
showing
of
a
substantial
number
of
negroes
in
the
community.
there
had
been
shown
a
wholly
--
not
wholly
but
somewhat
desperate
representation
by
negroes
on
juries
in
the
community
that
was
essentially
all
that
was
shown
and
the
courts
had
held
that
in
each
of
these
three
cases
that
the
court
couldn't
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
systematic
exclusion
could
be
shown
simply
from
this
disparity.
this
time
was
prior
to
the
whitus
case
last
term.
it
was
prior
to
the
jones
case
of
this
term.
it
was
prior
to
mr.
finklestein's
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
suggesting
a
way
out
of
this,
if
you
will,
imbroglio.
it
is
by
the
use
of
elementary
probability
theory.
and
i
can
recall
in
writing
the
brief,
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
looked
like
something
was
wrong
but
based
on
the
decisions
at
that
time
and
the
authority
that
i
was
able
to
find,
i
simply
couldn't
find
a
basis
for
argument
and
i
think
by
the
same
token
that
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
probably
couldn't
find
a
basis
for
a
disposition
of
the
case
on
this
point.
as
to
say,
this
was
almost
three
years
ago.
the
state
of
law
has
changed
substantially
now
to
the
extent
that
we
did
make
a
concession
and
although
which
it
is
normally
arguable
as
whether
or
not
we
made
a
concession,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
i
have
to
admit
that
we
did.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
any
admission
was
purely
an
admission
of
law,
not
changing
the
facts
at
all.
based
on
these
facts,
we
admit
that
the
law
as
it
now
stands
does
not
show
systematic
exclusion.
i
think
that
is
the
correct
characterization
of
my
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
our
position
is
now
based
on
these
very
same
facts
and
the
law
as
it
now
stands
three
years
later.
systematic
exclusion
is
shown
by
these
facts,
the
intervening
authorities
being
the
whitus
case
and
its
suggestion
of
the
use
of
probability
theory,
the
jones
case
this
term
which
perhaps
furthers
that
suggestion
or
at
least
makes
it
again,
mr.
finklestein's
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
which
spells
it
out
in
details,
spells
in
detail
the
use
of
elementary
probability
theory
to
show
--
not
to
show
that
there
was
systematic
exclusion
but
to
show
that
the
selection
was
not
made
at
random.
probability
theory
used
simply
to
show
the
likelihood
that
a
random
selection
would
have
resulted
in
the
particular
configuration
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
would
not
--
would
not
state
to
the
court
that
it
does
have
to
be
at
random.
we're
dealing
--
you
see,
in
this
case,
i
think
you'd
say
with
the
defensive
use
of
probability
theory.
the
respondent
introduces
evidences.
either
the
burden
is
on
the
respondent
now.
we've
made
our
prima
facie
case.
he
says
here,
this
evidence
shows
no
systematic
exclusion.
we
simply
used
probability
theory
to
show
that
his
raising
of
these
facts
is
not
sufficient
to
show
no
systematic
exclusion.
a
random
selection
is
the
ideal,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary.
but
i
do
believe
that
substantial
variations
from
a
random
selection
called
for
an
explanation.
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
list
of
100?
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
there
is
testimony
by
--
perhaps
the
record
--
perhaps
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
the
record
comments
on
this
perhaps
without
--
without
listing
them.
there
was
a
testimony
introduced
by
the
respondent
of
the
--
of
an
attorney
in
maury
county
who
had
been
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
at
his
trial
in
1949.
he
was
questioned
---
he
was
--
he
was
introduced
i
think
purely
on
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion.
his
testimony
was
to
the
effect
first
that
no
negroes
had
ever
served,
which
we've
already
dealt
with.
second,
he
was
asked
how
many
negroes
were
--
appeared
on
the
venire
facias
throughout
this
period
and
he
said
two
--
sometimes
two,
sometimes
three.
and
--
and
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
he
was
not.
we
would
again
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
burden
of
disproving
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
that
he
was
not
asked
and
we
would
say
that
the
respondent's
failure
to
ask
him
means
that
the
issue
must
be
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
the
record
is
to
the
extent
that
it
is
complete.
it
is
complete
only
as
to
the
general
practice
which
prevailed
prior
to
and
through
the
indictment
trial
in
conviction
of
the
petitioner,
not
as
to
the
particular
configuration.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
either
a
grand
jury
or
a
paid
jury.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
was
one
further
evidence
that
with
which
we
dealt
in
the
brief
and
i
think
should
be
dealt
with
here,
and
that
was
as
to
the
configuration
of
the
general
venire
of
1500.
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
list
of
100
would
in
large
part
depend
on
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
list
of
1,500
because
we
admit
that
the
list
of
100,
the
venire
facias
was
selected
from
the
list
of
1,500
at
random.
a
--
a
boy
ten
years
of
age
just
drew
the
names
out
of
a
box,
from
a
box
containing
the
1,500
names.
and
consequently,
the
number
which
would
appear
on
the
list
of
100
would
depend
very
substantially
on
the
number
which
appeared
in
the
list
of
1,500.
there
is
some
proof
with
reference
to
the
number
which
appeared
on
the
list
of
1,500.
this
was
in
the
affidavit
introduced
by
the
respondent,
the
affidavit
of
judge
joe
m.
ingram,
the
circuit
judge
who
had
tried
the
--
or
who
had
been
the
judge
during
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
for
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
judge
ingram's
testimony
was
to
this
effect.
first,
he
said.
“there
was
no
discrimination.
i
wouldn't
appoint
anybody
who
would
discriminate.”
well,
i've
dealt
with
that
--
that
sort
of
testimonies
in
type
but
no
weight
in
a
case
like
this.
secondly,
he
listed
--
named
22
negroes
whose
names
appeared
on
the
general
venire
of
1,501.
his
affidavit
stated
that
he
had
discovered
these
from
a
casual
examination
of
the
list.
well,
i
looked
at
the
list
of
1501
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
this
morning
or
asked
this
morning,
there's
no
designation
as
to
race.
but
i
questioned,
well
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
casual
examination.
i
will
list
some
1,500
more
names.
he
listed
22
negroes
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
recall.
the
--
it's
on
pages
46
and
47.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
he
did
not.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
it
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
i
would
answer
that
this
way.
i
agree,
it
does
have
--
it
does
have
relevance.
however,
the
list
is
still
in
existence.
the
list
of
1,500
names
is
still
in
existence.
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
before
this
court
where
the
person
in
the
respondent's
position
has
gone
over
the
list
and
accounted
for
the
number
of
negroes
existing,
and
the
percentages
have
appeared
in
numerous
of
the
court's
claims.
the
respondent
in
this
case
did
not
choose
to
follow
that
course
of
action
and
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioner
should
suffer
because
the
respondent
chose
not
to
do
that.
the
list
is
still
in
existence
and
if
somebody
wants
to
go
over
1,500
names,
then
they
certainly
can.
we
didn't
feel
it's
necessary
for
us
to
do
so
because
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
and
we
simply
attempted
to
respond
to
each
of
his
contentions.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
use
of
the
probability
theory
to
show
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
correct.
that
is
--
that
is
the
change
and
i
used
the
word
change
guardedly
because
if
a
change
is
made,
if
it's
going
to
be
made,
perhaps
it
would
be
through
this
case
rather
than
from
any
of
the
prior
cases.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
change
was
that
we
would
seek
is
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
showing
a
nominal
percentage
of
negroes
on
the
general
venire.
in
the
brown
case,
in
the
speller
case,
in
the
swain
case,
swain
in
'65,
there
was
a
great
disparity
between
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
community
and
the
percentage
of
names
appeared.
and
yet,
in
each
of
those
decisions,
the
court
held
that
systematic
exclusion
was
not
shown.
and
mr.
finklestein
of
course
in
detail
deals
with
certain
of
these
cases
and
states
that
perhaps
the
explanation
which
was
proffered
by
the
state
in
each
of
those
cases
was
not
sufficient.
we
are
attempting
to
show
that
in
this
case,
the
explanation
proffered
by
the
state
is
not
sufficient
to
rebut
petitioner's
prima
facie
case.
so
it's
in
that
respect
that
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
think
we're
one
step
back
from
that.
our
argument
is
directed
to
the
statement
that
there
were
not
enough
on
the
1,500.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
what
you're
saying
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
we're
basing
our
prima
facie
case
on
the
fact
that
there
had
never
been
a
negro
who
had
served,
ever.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
we
do.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that
however
is
an
entirely
separate
argument
from
the
argument
about
the
configuration
of
the
general
venire.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
alright,
so
yes,
we
do.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
well,
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
or
as
much
as
said
it
in
swain
when
they
--
in
which
of
course
as
you
know
they
held
that
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
that
is
our
point,
that
the
listing
of
22
does
not
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
if
they
don't
want
to
--
if
they
don't
want
to
take
the
trouble
to
do
it,
then
you've
got
to
assume
that
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
wouldn't
find
any
more.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
in
connection
with
the
judge's
naming
of
22,
which
he
states
he
personally
knew
from
a
casual
examination,
the
attorney
who
represented
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
had
called
as
a
witness
a
negro
who
was
a
civil
rights
leader
in
the
area
at
the
time
of
trial.
it
is
in
the
late
1940s.
he
asked
the
--
this
witness.
he
went
through
the
list.
at
least
he
went
through
i
think
14
of
the
22.
he
said,
“do
you
know
him?
do
you
know
him?”
the
civil
rights
leader
only
knew
7,
only
knew
half
of
those
about
--
about
which
he
was
asked.
and
this
made
suspect
in
my
mind
on
the
assertion
that
a
casual
examination
resulted
in
this
list
of
22.
if
i
may
for
a
moment
go
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
fact
that
we
did
not
raise
this
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
add
after
admitting
that
it
was
not
raised,
i
would
add
that
it's
clearly
an
admission
of
law,
purely
an
admission
of
law.
the
facts
of
guilt
are
admission
as
with
respect
or
was
with
respect
to
the
legal
result
from
given
facts.
and
the
authority
is
unanimous
that
an
admission
of
law
is
not
binding.
it's
only
an
admission
of
fact
which
is
binding.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
there's
no
question
but
to
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
it
wasn't
specifically
passed
on,
your
honor,
but
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
the
question
phrased
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
whether
or
not
the
fact
showed
systematic
exclusion.
this
is
one
way
of
showing
systematic
exclusion.
all
of
the
facts
were
before
the
court
of
appeals,
so
technically,
this
question
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
--
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
problem
of
jurisdiction.
the
next
question
which
has
already
been
adverted
to,
is
a
question
of
the
excusal
by
the
judge
of
however
many
negroes
appeared
on
the
venire
facias
of
a
hundred.
the
proof
in
this
matter
was
again
not
disputed.
first,
the
proof
was
there
were
never
more
than
three.
well,
this
results
again
from
there
being
so
few
or
too
few
negroes
on
the
general
venire
of
1,500
when
a
random
selection
from
a
list
of
1,500
--
when
a
series
of
random
selections
from
a
list
of
1,500
never
produces
more
than
three
negroes.
there
are
very
few
more
than
3%
on
the
list
of
1,500.
there
may
be
--
maybe
5%
but
they're
certainly
not
20%.
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
to
the
effect
that
the
negroes
who
were
called
never
more
than
three
always
asked
to
be
excused
and
always
were
excused.
they
were
excused
sometimes
with
reason,
often
without
reason.
they
simply
ask
the
judge
in
every
instance,
so
the
testimony
went,
to
be
excused
and
the
excuse
--
well,
not
that
there
was
an
excuse
the
judge
did
excuse.
we
attack
this
procedure.
there
was
admittedly
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
judge
was
very
liberal
with
whites,
also.
his
attitude
was
he
didn't
want
to
serve
on
the
jury,
i'll
let
you
all.
now,
this
causes
a
serious
problem
in
a
rural
southern
community
where
negro
has
never
served.
first
of
all,
there
are
very
few
who
call
the
testimony
is
never
more
than
three.
it's
known
throughout
the
community,
no
negro
has
ever
served.
it's
presumably
known
that
the
judge
will
excuse
negroes
who
asked
to
be.
there's
an
obvious
pressure
on
negroes
under
these
circumstances
to
seek
excusal
from
service.
we
think
that
the
situation
is
such,
that
there
is
an
easy
remedy,
and
that
is
for
the
judge
to
be
required
to
grant
excuses
not
only
to
negroes
but
to
whites
only
when
there's
a
legal
--
legal
ground
for
excuse.
we
don't
suggest
that
he
shouldn't
excuse
negroes
without
cause
but
should
excuse
whites
because
we
are
trying
to
force
service
by
negroes.
we
don't
submit
that
that
should
be
done,
but
he
can
even
handedly
grant
or
disallow
excuse
from
service
by
simply
requiring
legal
excuse.
he
did
not
do
so.
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
ill
will
on
his
part
is
necessary.
the
effect
was
that
negroes
never
served
and
that
effect
is
highly
undesirable.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
proof
in
swain
though
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
the
proof
in
swain
however,
you
recall
the
court,
at
least
to
my
reading,
stated
that
the
challenge,
the
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system
in
a
particular
case
so
as
to
exclude
on
negroes
would
not
constitute
systematic
exclusion.
but
the
court
reserved
the
question
and
i
think
indicated
its
opinion
in
that
reservation
as
to
what
the
decision
would
be
if
the
peremptory
challenge
system
were
always
used
consistently
over
a
period
of
time
with
the
result
that
no
negro
ever
served.
and
in
success
of
what
we've
got
here,
we
consider
swain
to
be
authority
of
our
position.
in
swain,
of
course,
it
was
a
county
prosecutor.
here,
it
was
a
judge.
by
a
course
of
action,
the
result
was
negroes
never
served
over
long
extended
--
well,
uniformly
from
the
beginning
of
the
courts
in
maury
country
through
the
time
the
petitioner
trial
it
never
served.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
not
in
this
record
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that
could
be
--
yes,
sir.
except
that
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
excuse
which
was
dual
first
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
time
and
secondly
by
the
attorney
who
have
represented
the
petitioner
at
the
time.
so
they
always
has
to
be
excused,
so
to
that
extent,
the
record
will
indicate
that
they
always
have
been
excused.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
judge
ingram's
affidavit
in
that
respect
is
quite
clear
that
since
this
time
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
so
as
the
testimony
of
mr.
tomlinson,
the
attorney
for
petitioner
at
the
time
of
his
trial
that
since
that
time,
there
has
been
service
by
negroes.
now,
i'm
not
sure
if
this
will
not
to
exert
only
in
grand
juries
but
they're
both
quite
explicit
that
there
has
been
service
since
this
time
and
i
think
that
mr.
tomlinson
indicates
that
maybe
the
dates
from
1950
or
‘51
or
‘52.
but
the
testimony
is
unanimous
until
this
time.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
this
case
of
jones
versus
georgia,
it
was
decided
per
curiam
october
the
16th,
i
think
it
was
a
companion
case
to
coleman
versus
alabama.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
these
cases
are
somewhat
different
from
this
case
because
both
in
whitus
and
in
jones,
there
had
been
--
negroes
had
served
on
juries
and
the
attack
was
as
to
the
disparity.
and
you
see,
we
once
step
or
moved
from
there,
we're
one
step
stronger
than
that
because
they've
never
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor
in
whitus,
the
tax
lists
were
marked
--
i
don't
remember
jones.
i'm
not
sure
if
you're
correct.
the
--
along
that
line,
the
petitioner,
i
mean
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
rely
on
that
line
of
reason
going
back
to
the
cassell
case
--
cassell
versus
texas
where
there
was
a
disparity
but
there
was
testimony
that
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
property
owners.
it
even
went
to
the
percentage
as
it
did
in
whitus
and
in
jones.
in
this
case,
there
has
not
been
any
testimony
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
own
property
without
any
qualifications
as
to
specific
percentages.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
property
owners
than
their
percentage
in
the
general
population
or
than
their
percentage
of
the
adult
males,
both
of
which
are
approved.
the
respondent
places
strong
reliance
on
the
case
of
kennedy
versus
the
state
decided
about
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
1949
or
‘50.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
shall
reserve
a
comment
on
that
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
manner
that
the
court
may
have
are
completely
in
mind
but
i'm
not
sure
if
mr.
davies
does.
he
keeps
talking
about
the
fact
that
we
didn't
prove
there
were
any
qualified,
any
negroes
who
were
qualified
jurors.
if
i
may
quote
from
norris
versus
alabama
as
to
point
a
prima
facie
case
comes
into
effect,
maybe
this
will
help.
this
was
following
the
testimony
that
negroes
constituted
some
way
around,
well,
a
large
substantial
percent
of
the
population
and
that
none
had
ever
served.
the
court
then
says,
that
testimony
in
itself
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
of
equal
protection.
the
case
does
made
was
supplemented
by
direct
testimony
that
specified
negroes
who
qualify
and
that
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
not
part
of
my
case
to
prove
that
any
negroes
were
qualified
or
have
approved
years
that
they
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
and
that
none
had
ever
served.
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
question
for
this
reason.
i'm
reading
from
the
appendix
page
58,
the
district
court's
opinion,
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
well,
i
--
assuming
arguendo
that
the
clear
erroneous
rule
applies,
it
couldn't
be
anymore
clearly
erroneous.
he
then
goes
on
to
consider
the
other
evidence
having
held
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made
and
he
has
obviously
considered
the
evidence
in
the
wrong
light.
we're
not
asking
as
mr.
davies
implied
that
a
judge
forced
a
negro
to
serve.
in
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
scrupulously
avoid
such
a
suggestion.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
court
not
excuse
anybody,
white
or
negro
without
cause.
that's
all
we're
asking.
when
he
had
the
reason
that
they
have
never
served,
i
think
mr.
davies
was
exactly
right.
they've
always
--
on
the
record
shows
that
they've
always
asked
to
be
excused
whether
they
have
had
cause
or
not,
the
judge
is
excused
where
you
can
even-handedly
stop
that.
you
don't
require
negroes
to
do
anything
different
than
from
whites,
you
just
require
the
judge
to
not
excuse
someone
unless
there's
legal
excuse
or
legal
reason
for
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
statistics
in
this
case,
the
--
i
admit
there
is
a
problem,
i
didn't
represent
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
and
consequently,
i
have
attempted
to
use
presumptions
to
establish
some
of
the
figures.
i
think
that
we've
justified
in
doing
this
because
of
the
proof
in
the
record.
i
think
there's
sufficient
proof
in
the
record
to
show
how
many
negroes
were
on
a
particular
list.
the
best
evidence
of
this
in
fact
is
in
the
kennedy
case
which
mr.
davies
relies
on.
they
go
to
great
trouble
to
name
or
rather
to
list
a
number
of
negroes
on
the
general
venire
as
being
--
the
case
says
there
were
nine
negroes
out
of
a
110
where
two
of
them
were
dead
and
one
of
them
had
moved
out
the
county
and
so
i
think
we
put
it
well
not
count
those.
of
the
remaining
living
residence,
6.6%
of
the
list
of
a
hundred
or
in
this
106
were
negroes.
now,
we
have
shown
and
the
same
was
true
in
kennedy
who
has
no
proof
that
a
lesser
percentage
of
the
population
was
negro
or
rather
a
less
percentage
of
qualified
jurors
were
negroes.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
not
only
is
it
reasonable
to
assume,
the
court
must
assume
that
the
same
percentage
of
negroes
were
qualified
for
jury
duty
as
it
was
in
the
percentage
of
negro
adult
male
residents
of
the
county.
using
that
percentage,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
a
composition
of
a
venire
facias
of
a
hundred
or
106
containing
6.6%
negroes
would
happen
would
occur
at
random
list
in
once
in
a
million
times.
now,
we
submit
this
solely
to
show
that
the
selection
was
not
made
at
random.
the
supreme
court
said,
you
see
here,
this
evidence
shows
that
a
random
selection
or
shows
no
systematic
exclusion.
this
is
the
evidence
they
rely
on.
we
used
elementary;
it's
at
the
beginning
of
every
book
on
statistical
theory.
elementary
probability
theory
to
show
that
the
evidence
proper,
to
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion
doesn't
have
that
effect
at
all.
that's
the
only
way
we've
used
it
here.
thank
you,your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
negro.
the
petitioner
was
indicted,
tried
and
convicted
in
maury
county,
tennessee
in
1949
for
the
offense
of
rape.
he
contends
in
this
case
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
from
the
petty
jury
which
tried
and
convicted
him.
the
salient
facts
in
the
case
are
wholly
undisputed.
the
census
reports
from
maury
county
were
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
district
court.
they
showed
that
in
excess
of
20%
of
the
total
population
of
maury
county,
at
all
relevant
times,
were
negro.
the
proof
also
showed
without
dispute
that
prior
to
and
including
the
time
of
petitioner's
indictment,
trial
and
conviction,
no
negro,
none
whatever
had
ever
served
on
any
grand
or
petty
jury
in
maury
county.
there's
absolutely
no
question
and
i
would
hardly
even
think
it
necessary
to
mention
it
if
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
district
court
held
otherwise
that
these
two
items
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion
showing
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
population
to
be
negro
and
showing
an
absolute
failure
of
service
at
any
time
on
the
part
of
negroes.
as
stated,
the
district
court
nevertheless
held
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
his
conviction
was
in
1949,
your
honor.
his
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court
was
in
1964.
the
case
of
norris
versus
alabama
i
think
is
completely
determinative
of
this
point
of
the
prima
facie
case.
the
case
quite
somewhat
similar
in
all
respects
except
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
jackson
county,
alabama
was
much,
much
smaller.
this
is
294
u.s.
590
showing
about
8%
of
the
population
to
be
negro,
on
591
showing
that
there
had
never
been
any
service
by
negroes
on
grand
or
petty
jury
and
the
court
then
states
that
testimony
in
itself
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
the
denial
of
the
equal
protection
which
the
constitution
guarantees.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
have
no
explanation
for
it.
i
was
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
for
the
first
time
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
--
i
have
no
idea
why
the
petition
was
not
filed
earlier.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
there
was
no
appeal.
i'm
not
advised,
your
honor,
as
to
when
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
state
court
on
this
basis.
mr.
davies
informed
me
that
it
was
in
1962.
i
have
an
idea
as
to
perhaps
why
the
challenge
was
not
previously
made.
of
course,
it
was
around
that
time
that
habeas
corpus
became
--
that
the
use
of
the
writ
became
prevalent
and
it
kind
of
enters
throughout
the
country.
also,
mr.
davies
relies
heavily,
and
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
his
reliance
is
misplaced
on
a
tennessee
supreme
court
decision
concerning
a
prior
conviction
in
maury
county
some
two
years
prior
to
the
--
i
suppose
three
years
prior
to
the
petitioner's
indictment
and
conviction
in
which
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion
was
raised,
proof
was
taken
and
the
court
held
that
systematic
exclusion
had
not
been
proved.
certiorari
was
sought
in
this
court
and
denied.
i
think
that
i
will
be
able
to
convince
the
court
that
the
questions
asked
and
the
reasoning
employed
by
the
tennessee
court
in
that
case
were
erroneous
and
that
the
--
that
the
facts
presented
in
the
case
was
erroneously
decided.
nevertheless,
this
case
--
this
court
did
not
choose
to
review
the
case
at
that
time
and
this
may
have
had
some
inhibiting
effect
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
the
decision
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
was
in
1949.
the
array
of
the
grand
and
petty
jury
that
was
challenged
was
in
1946.
i
am
--
i'm
speaking
strictly
on
the
record,
your
honor,
expressing
interest
in
--
and
i
would
guess
that
was
--
that
was
what
it
is
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
davies
will
--
will
say
that's
what
it
is.
at
any
rate,
on
the
decisions
beginning
with
norris
which
was
in
19
--
in
35
through
patton
versus
mississippi
in
47,
whitus
decided
last
term
and
coleman
versus
alabama
decided
this
time.
petitioner
clearly
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
shifted
the
burden,
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
respondent
to
prove
that
what
the
introduce
evidence
to
the
fact
that
negroes
had
not
been
systemically
excluded.
the
respondent's
first
attempt
to
show
no
systematic
exclusion
was
to
say
that
petitioner
had
not
shown
that
any
negroes
were
qualified
for
jury
service.
well,
in
the
first
place,
respondent
misconstrues
the
nature
of
the
prima
facie
case.
the
burden
is
shifted
to
him
to
introduce
evidence
to
the
effect
that
negroes
are
not
qualified.
the
prima
facie
case
has
already
been
established.
it's
very
clear
under
norris
and
the
later
decisions
that
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
out
by
showing
a
substantial
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
population,
not
--
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
negroes
aren't
qualified
for
jury
service.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
maury
county,
your
honor.
it's
south
of
nashville.
it's
in
southern
central
tennessee.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
i
would
estimate
40
miles
from
alabama.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
it's
right
in
the
middle
of
tennessee
but
in
the
southern
portion
of
middle
tennessee.
the
respondent
introduced
the
statutes
setting
forth
the
relevant
qualifications
for
jurors
which
were
fairly
usual
for
this
time
which
was
20
years
ago.
they
have
since
been
changed
but
the
qualifications
set
forth
by
the
tennessee
statutes
--
and
this
--
this
is
set
forth
in
--
in
our
brief.
it's
a
combination
of
the
general
statute
and
the
private
act,
which
applied
only
to
maury
county.
adult,
male
freeholders
or
householders
and
upright
intelligent
men
known
for
their
integrity,
fair
character
and
sound
judgment.
respondent
introduced
no
proof
whatever
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
adult
males
as
compared
with
white
adult
males
than
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
general
population.
respondent
introduced
no
proof
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
whites
were
freeholders
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
were
white
--
were
householders
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
were
upright
intelligent
men
known
for
their
integrity,
fair
character
and
sound
judgment.
so
it's
our
contention
that
the
respondent
has
wholly
failed
in
his
attempt
to
carry
the
burden
of
showing
that
fewer
negroes
than
--
or
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
those
in
the
general
population
which
was
in
excess
of
20%
were
eligible
for
jury
service.
respondent
introduced
proof
that
the
jurors
were
selected
from
the
tax
rolls
but
again
introduced
no
evidence
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
than
the
20%
in
the
general
population
were
taxpayers.
the
court
has
no
evidence
therefore
on
which
to
base
any
finding
except
that
in
excess
of
20%
of
those
persons
eligible
for
jury
duty
were
negroes.
respondent
or
rather
petitioner
was
not
satisfied
with
relying
solely
on
the
respondent's
failure
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
so
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
possible
at
that
time,
we
attempted
to
show
that
the
result
gained
by
respondent's
failure
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
fact
the
correct
result
in
this
panel.
we
introduced
by
agreement
the
sub-census
i
suppose
you
would
call
it,
breaking
down
the
population
figures
from
the
total
population
into
adult
male
negroes
and
adult
male
whites,
which
is
the
largest
category
under
the
jury
qualification
statute.
this
showed,
as
you
might
guess,
that
again
in
excess
of
20%
of
all
adult
males
in
maury
county
were
negroes.
then
--
and
this
is
found
in
our
brief
in
footnote
1
an
examination
of
the
tennessee
authorities
as
to
what
a
person
had
to
be
in
order
to
constitute
a
householder.
an
adult
male
householder
unquestionably
is
qualified
for
jury
service.
the
only
way
to
determine
how
many
freeholders
there
were
would
be
to
go
to
the
tax
records.
this
was
respondent's
responsibility
and
he
did
not
carry
it.
we
examined
the
tennessee
authorities
in
detail
and
it
set
this
forth
in
the
brief
to
show
that
virtually
all
adult
males
are
householders
under
the
tennessee
law,
and
i
won't
belabor
the
point
by
discussing
it
here,
but
it's
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
brief.
so
--
so
they're
not
being
satisfied
to
rely
wholly
on
the
burden
of
proof.
petitioner
weren't
here
and
went
forward
himself
and
showed
that
--
that
in
fact
an
excess
of
20%
of
those
persons
eligible
for
jury
duty
were
negroes.
and
we
think
that
the
courts
below
and
this
court
have
no
evidence
to
base
any
finding
other
than
that.
respondent
next
attempted
to
rebut
petitioner's
prima
facie
case
and
i
may
state
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
contrary
to
the
district
court
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
out
but
held
that
respondent
had
rebutted
that
case
successfully.
they
--
in
doing
so,
they
relied
upon
the
elements
which
i
will
discuss
important
and
important
for
us.
what
was
the
nature
of
respondent's
rebuttal
evidence
with
respect
to
selection?
well,
as
a
background,
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
briefly
discuss
the
method
by
which
jurors
are
selected
in
maury
county.
first,
the
circuit
judge
appoints
jury
commissioners.
these
commissioners
then
biannually
select
from
whatever
source
they
use
and
there
was
evidence
of
the
tax
books
we
use
but
again,
no
evidence
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
then
in
the
general
population
were
property
owners.
they
select
a
large
list
which
is
known
as
the
general
venire.
these
lists
for
the
particular
general
venire
are
from
which
the
juries
that
indicted
and
convicted
petitioner
was
selected
consisting
of
1,501
persons.
this
list
was
used
for
a
two-year
period
and
from
this
list
before
every
term
of
court,
three
times
each
year,
they
were
selected
by
a
--
the
names
of
all
1,501
were
placed
on
individual
slips
of
paper.
before
each
term
a
boy,
member
as
ten
years
of
age
drew
a
hundred
or
approximately
a
hundred
names
out
of
the
box
in
which
these
1,501
names
were
placed.
and
that
list
of
100
is
called
the
venire
facias.
obviously,
we
have
no
complaint
about
the
method
of
selection.
they
are
completely
at
random.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
with
the
differentiation?
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
not
the
--
the
record
shows
there
is
none.
if
i
may
comment
on
that,
the
respondent
attempts
to
use
this
in
a
way
which
i
think
the
court
will
see
to
be
clearly
impermissible.
respondent
says
--
well,
the
jury
commissioners
were
honest
men
and
they
only
selected
a
few
negroes.
therefore,
there
could
be
only
a
few
negroes
who
were
property
owners.
there
could
be
only
a
few
who
are
on
the
tax
list.
of
course,
the
basic
assumption
to
that
line
of
reasoning
is
the
impermissible
assumption
that
the
jury
commissioners
performed
their
duty
in
a
--
in
a
manner
which
did
not
discriminate.
this
is
the
--
and
this
is
the
contention
that's
raised
in
every
systematic
exclusion
case.
well
gee,
the
jury
commissioners
were
honest,
upright
men
and
they
knew
they
weren't
supposed
to
discriminate.
and
for
that
reason,
we'll
presume
that
they
didn't
discriminate
and
we'll
find
those
systematic
exclusions
that
this
court
is
throwing
out
and
paid
no
attention
to
that
contention
every
time
it
has
been
raised.
so
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
will
--
will
decline
to
accept
the
respondent's
invitation
to
--
to
use
that
reasoning
in
this
case.
from
the
venire
facias
of
100
names
for
a
relatively
brief
period
of
time
of
a
couple
of
weeks,
those
persons
are
notified
and
then
the
judge
entertains
request
for
excusal
from
service.
these
are
granted
or
denied
and
then
the
remaining
jurors
form
the
final
venire
facias
from
which
grand
jurors
are
selected.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
--
one
persons
who
make
up
the
biennial
general
venire
from
that
list,
there
are
selected
three
times
a
year
admittedly
at
random
approximately
100
names.
these
persons,
after
request
for
excusal
have
been
ruled
on
by
the
circuit
judge
composed
of
final
venire
facias,
and
then
immediately
upon
the
beginning
of
each
term,
there
are
selected
from
this
list
again
admittedly
at
random.
the
first
13
names
drawn
from
the
list
compose
the
grand
jury
and
then
from
the
remaining
names
are
selected
the
petty
juries
for
the
trials
of
cases
during
the
term.
there
are
four
distinct
steps
in
the
selection
process.
the
first
is
the
selection
by
the
jury
commissioners
of
the
general
venire.
it
is
this
step
which
--
with
which
we
are
extremely
concerned
right
now.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
different
from
what
it
was
in
the
court
below
and
the
respondent
has
challenged
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
change
his
position
at
this
time
because
you
raised
the
question
on
i
think
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
great
characterization
of
what
the
court
said.
the
--
our
position
in
no
way
changes
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
facts
are
the
same
as
they
were
in
the
court
below.
perhaps
the
best
explanation
is
one
of
the
passage
of
time.
the
brief
which
was
written
by
the
petitioner
who
was
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
written
in
1965.
the
court
will
recall
that
at
that
time
to
a
certain
extent,
the
decisions
were
perhaps
characterized
as
an
imbroglio
from
brown
versus
allen,
speller
versus
allen
just
before
the
time
the
debrief
was
found,
swain
versus
alabama
where
there
had
been
a
showing
of
a
substantial
number
of
negroes
in
the
community.
there
had
been
shown
a
wholly
--
not
wholly
but
somewhat
desperate
representation
by
negroes
on
juries
in
the
community
that
was
essentially
all
that
was
shown
and
the
courts
had
held
that
in
each
of
these
three
cases
that
the
court
couldn't
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
systematic
exclusion
could
be
shown
simply
from
this
disparity.
this
time
was
prior
to
the
whitus
case
last
term.
it
was
prior
to
the
jones
case
of
this
term.
it
was
prior
to
mr.
finklestein's
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
suggesting
a
way
out
of
this,
if
you
will,
imbroglio.
it
is
by
the
use
of
elementary
probability
theory.
and
i
can
recall
in
writing
the
brief,
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
looked
like
something
was
wrong
but
based
on
the
decisions
at
that
time
and
the
authority
that
i
was
able
to
find,
i
simply
couldn't
find
a
basis
for
argument
and
i
think
by
the
same
token
that
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
probably
couldn't
find
a
basis
for
a
disposition
of
the
case
on
this
point.
as
to
say,
this
was
almost
three
years
ago.
the
state
of
law
has
changed
substantially
now
to
the
extent
that
we
did
make
a
concession
and
although
which
it
is
normally
arguable
as
whether
or
not
we
made
a
concession,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
i
have
to
admit
that
we
did.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
any
admission
was
purely
an
admission
of
law,
not
changing
the
facts
at
all.
based
on
these
facts,
we
admit
that
the
law
as
it
now
stands
does
not
show
systematic
exclusion.
i
think
that
is
the
correct
characterization
of
my
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
our
position
is
now
based
on
these
very
same
facts
and
the
law
as
it
now
stands
three
years
later.
systematic
exclusion
is
shown
by
these
facts,
the
intervening
authorities
being
the
whitus
case
and
its
suggestion
of
the
use
of
probability
theory,
the
jones
case
this
term
which
perhaps
furthers
that
suggestion
or
at
least
makes
it
again,
mr.
finklestein's
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
which
spells
it
out
in
details,
spells
in
detail
the
use
of
elementary
probability
theory
to
show
--
not
to
show
that
there
was
systematic
exclusion
but
to
show
that
the
selection
was
not
made
at
random.
probability
theory
used
simply
to
show
the
likelihood
that
a
random
selection
would
have
resulted
in
the
particular
configuration
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
would
not
--
would
not
state
to
the
court
that
it
does
have
to
be
at
random.
we're
dealing
--
you
see,
in
this
case,
i
think
you'd
say
with
the
defensive
use
of
probability
theory.
the
respondent
introduces
evidences.
either
the
burden
is
on
the
respondent
now.
we've
made
our
prima
facie
case.
he
says
here,
this
evidence
shows
no
systematic
exclusion.
we
simply
used
probability
theory
to
show
that
his
raising
of
these
facts
is
not
sufficient
to
show
no
systematic
exclusion.
a
random
selection
is
the
ideal,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary.
but
i
do
believe
that
substantial
variations
from
a
random
selection
called
for
an
explanation.
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
list
of
100?
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
there
is
testimony
by
--
perhaps
the
record
--
perhaps
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
the
record
comments
on
this
perhaps
without
--
without
listing
them.
there
was
a
testimony
introduced
by
the
respondent
of
the
--
of
an
attorney
in
maury
county
who
had
been
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
at
his
trial
in
1949.
he
was
questioned
---
he
was
--
he
was
introduced
i
think
purely
on
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion.
his
testimony
was
to
the
effect
first
that
no
negroes
had
ever
served,
which
we've
already
dealt
with.
second,
he
was
asked
how
many
negroes
were
--
appeared
on
the
venire
facias
throughout
this
period
and
he
said
two
--
sometimes
two,
sometimes
three.
and
--
and
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
he
was
not.
we
would
again
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
burden
of
disproving
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
that
he
was
not
asked
and
we
would
say
that
the
respondent's
failure
to
ask
him
means
that
the
issue
must
be
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
the
record
is
to
the
extent
that
it
is
complete.
it
is
complete
only
as
to
the
general
practice
which
prevailed
prior
to
and
through
the
indictment
trial
in
conviction
of
the
petitioner,
not
as
to
the
particular
configuration.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
either
a
grand
jury
or
a
paid
jury.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
was
one
further
evidence
that
with
which
we
dealt
in
the
brief
and
i
think
should
be
dealt
with
here,
and
that
was
as
to
the
configuration
of
the
general
venire
of
1500.
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
list
of
100
would
in
large
part
depend
on
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
list
of
1,500
because
we
admit
that
the
list
of
100,
the
venire
facias
was
selected
from
the
list
of
1,500
at
random.
a
--
a
boy
ten
years
of
age
just
drew
the
names
out
of
a
box,
from
a
box
containing
the
1,500
names.
and
consequently,
the
number
which
would
appear
on
the
list
of
100
would
depend
very
substantially
on
the
number
which
appeared
in
the
list
of
1,500.
there
is
some
proof
with
reference
to
the
number
which
appeared
on
the
list
of
1,500.
this
was
in
the
affidavit
introduced
by
the
respondent,
the
affidavit
of
judge
joe
m.
ingram,
the
circuit
judge
who
had
tried
the
--
or
who
had
been
the
judge
during
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
for
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
judge
ingram's
testimony
was
to
this
effect.
first,
he
said.
“there
was
no
discrimination.
i
wouldn't
appoint
anybody
who
would
discriminate.”
well,
i've
dealt
with
that
--
that
sort
of
testimonies
in
type
but
no
weight
in
a
case
like
this.
secondly,
he
listed
--
named
22
negroes
whose
names
appeared
on
the
general
venire
of
1,501.
his
affidavit
stated
that
he
had
discovered
these
from
a
casual
examination
of
the
list.
well,
i
looked
at
the
list
of
1501
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
this
morning
or
asked
this
morning,
there's
no
designation
as
to
race.
but
i
questioned,
well
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
casual
examination.
i
will
list
some
1,500
more
names.
he
listed
22
negroes
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
recall.
the
--
it's
on
pages
46
and
47.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
he
did
not.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
it
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
i
would
answer
that
this
way.
i
agree,
it
does
have
--
it
does
have
relevance.
however,
the
list
is
still
in
existence.
the
list
of
1,500
names
is
still
in
existence.
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
before
this
court
where
the
person
in
the
respondent's
position
has
gone
over
the
list
and
accounted
for
the
number
of
negroes
existing,
and
the
percentages
have
appeared
in
numerous
of
the
court's
claims.
the
respondent
in
this
case
did
not
choose
to
follow
that
course
of
action
and
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioner
should
suffer
because
the
respondent
chose
not
to
do
that.
the
list
is
still
in
existence
and
if
somebody
wants
to
go
over
1,500
names,
then
they
certainly
can.
we
didn't
feel
it's
necessary
for
us
to
do
so
because
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
and
we
simply
attempted
to
respond
to
each
of
his
contentions.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
use
of
the
probability
theory
to
show
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
correct.
that
is
--
that
is
the
change
and
i
used
the
word
change
guardedly
because
if
a
change
is
made,
if
it's
going
to
be
made,
perhaps
it
would
be
through
this
case
rather
than
from
any
of
the
prior
cases.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
change
was
that
we
would
seek
is
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
showing
a
nominal
percentage
of
negroes
on
the
general
venire.
in
the
brown
case,
in
the
speller
case,
in
the
swain
case,
swain
in
'65,
there
was
a
great
disparity
between
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
community
and
the
percentage
of
names
appeared.
and
yet,
in
each
of
those
decisions,
the
court
held
that
systematic
exclusion
was
not
shown.
and
mr.
finklestein
of
course
in
detail
deals
with
certain
of
these
cases
and
states
that
perhaps
the
explanation
which
was
proffered
by
the
state
in
each
of
those
cases
was
not
sufficient.
we
are
attempting
to
show
that
in
this
case,
the
explanation
proffered
by
the
state
is
not
sufficient
to
rebut
petitioner's
prima
facie
case.
so
it's
in
that
respect
that
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor,
i
think
we're
one
step
back
from
that.
our
argument
is
directed
to
the
statement
that
there
were
not
enough
on
the
1,500.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
what
you're
saying
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
we're
basing
our
prima
facie
case
on
the
fact
that
there
had
never
been
a
negro
who
had
served,
ever.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
we
do.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that
however
is
an
entirely
separate
argument
from
the
argument
about
the
configuration
of
the
general
venire.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
alright,
so
yes,
we
do.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
well,
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
or
as
much
as
said
it
in
swain
when
they
--
in
which
of
course
as
you
know
they
held
that
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
that
is
our
point,
that
the
listing
of
22
does
not
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
your
honor.
if
they
don't
want
to
--
if
they
don't
want
to
take
the
trouble
to
do
it,
then
you've
got
to
assume
that
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
wouldn't
find
any
more.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
in
connection
with
the
judge's
naming
of
22,
which
he
states
he
personally
knew
from
a
casual
examination,
the
attorney
who
represented
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
had
called
as
a
witness
a
negro
who
was
a
civil
rights
leader
in
the
area
at
the
time
of
trial.
it
is
in
the
late
1940s.
he
asked
the
--
this
witness.
he
went
through
the
list.
at
least
he
went
through
i
think
14
of
the
22.
he
said,
“do
you
know
him?
do
you
know
him?”
the
civil
rights
leader
only
knew
7,
only
knew
half
of
those
about
--
about
which
he
was
asked.
and
this
made
suspect
in
my
mind
on
the
assertion
that
a
casual
examination
resulted
in
this
list
of
22.
if
i
may
for
a
moment
go
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
fact
that
we
did
not
raise
this
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
add
after
admitting
that
it
was
not
raised,
i
would
add
that
it's
clearly
an
admission
of
law,
purely
an
admission
of
law.
the
facts
of
guilt
are
admission
as
with
respect
or
was
with
respect
to
the
legal
result
from
given
facts.
and
the
authority
is
unanimous
that
an
admission
of
law
is
not
binding.
it's
only
an
admission
of
fact
which
is
binding.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
there's
no
question
but
to
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
it
wasn't
specifically
passed
on,
your
honor,
but
the
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
the
question
phrased
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
whether
or
not
the
fact
showed
systematic
exclusion.
this
is
one
way
of
showing
systematic
exclusion.
all
of
the
facts
were
before
the
court
of
appeals,
so
technically,
this
question
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
--
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
problem
of
jurisdiction.
the
next
question
which
has
already
been
adverted
to,
is
a
question
of
the
excusal
by
the
judge
of
however
many
negroes
appeared
on
the
venire
facias
of
a
hundred.
the
proof
in
this
matter
was
again
not
disputed.
first,
the
proof
was
there
were
never
more
than
three.
well,
this
results
again
from
there
being
so
few
or
too
few
negroes
on
the
general
venire
of
1,500
when
a
random
selection
from
a
list
of
1,500
--
when
a
series
of
random
selections
from
a
list
of
1,500
never
produces
more
than
three
negroes.
there
are
very
few
more
than
3%
on
the
list
of
1,500.
there
may
be
--
maybe
5%
but
they're
certainly
not
20%.
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
to
the
effect
that
the
negroes
who
were
called
never
more
than
three
always
asked
to
be
excused
and
always
were
excused.
they
were
excused
sometimes
with
reason,
often
without
reason.
they
simply
ask
the
judge
in
every
instance,
so
the
testimony
went,
to
be
excused
and
the
excuse
--
well,
not
that
there
was
an
excuse
the
judge
did
excuse.
we
attack
this
procedure.
there
was
admittedly
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
judge
was
very
liberal
with
whites,
also.
his
attitude
was
he
didn't
want
to
serve
on
the
jury,
i'll
let
you
all.
now,
this
causes
a
serious
problem
in
a
rural
southern
community
where
negro
has
never
served.
first
of
all,
there
are
very
few
who
call
the
testimony
is
never
more
than
three.
it's
known
throughout
the
community,
no
negro
has
ever
served.
it's
presumably
known
that
the
judge
will
excuse
negroes
who
asked
to
be.
there's
an
obvious
pressure
on
negroes
under
these
circumstances
to
seek
excusal
from
service.
we
think
that
the
situation
is
such,
that
there
is
an
easy
remedy,
and
that
is
for
the
judge
to
be
required
to
grant
excuses
not
only
to
negroes
but
to
whites
only
when
there's
a
legal
--
legal
ground
for
excuse.
we
don't
suggest
that
he
shouldn't
excuse
negroes
without
cause
but
should
excuse
whites
because
we
are
trying
to
force
service
by
negroes.
we
don't
submit
that
that
should
be
done,
but
he
can
even
handedly
grant
or
disallow
excuse
from
service
by
simply
requiring
legal
excuse.
he
did
not
do
so.
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
ill
will
on
his
part
is
necessary.
the
effect
was
that
negroes
never
served
and
that
effect
is
highly
undesirable.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
the
proof
in
swain
though
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
the
proof
in
swain
however,
you
recall
the
court,
at
least
to
my
reading,
stated
that
the
challenge,
the
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system
in
a
particular
case
so
as
to
exclude
on
negroes
would
not
constitute
systematic
exclusion.
but
the
court
reserved
the
question
and
i
think
indicated
its
opinion
in
that
reservation
as
to
what
the
decision
would
be
if
the
peremptory
challenge
system
were
always
used
consistently
over
a
period
of
time
with
the
result
that
no
negro
ever
served.
and
in
success
of
what
we've
got
here,
we
consider
swain
to
be
authority
of
our
position.
in
swain,
of
course,
it
was
a
county
prosecutor.
here,
it
was
a
judge.
by
a
course
of
action,
the
result
was
negroes
never
served
over
long
extended
--
well,
uniformly
from
the
beginning
of
the
courts
in
maury
country
through
the
time
the
petitioner
trial
it
never
served.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that's
not
in
this
record
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
that
could
be
--
yes,
sir.
except
that
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
excuse
which
was
dual
first
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
time
and
secondly
by
the
attorney
who
have
represented
the
petitioner
at
the
time.
so
they
always
has
to
be
excused,
so
to
that
extent,
the
record
will
indicate
that
they
always
have
been
excused.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
judge
ingram's
affidavit
in
that
respect
is
quite
clear
that
since
this
time
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
so
as
the
testimony
of
mr.
tomlinson,
the
attorney
for
petitioner
at
the
time
of
his
trial
that
since
that
time,
there
has
been
service
by
negroes.
now,
i'm
not
sure
if
this
will
not
to
exert
only
in
grand
juries
but
they're
both
quite
explicit
that
there
has
been
service
since
this
time
and
i
think
that
mr.
tomlinson
indicates
that
maybe
the
dates
from
1950
or
‘51
or
‘52.
but
the
testimony
is
unanimous
until
this
time.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
no,
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
this
case
of
jones
versus
georgia,
it
was
decided
per
curiam
october
the
16th,
i
think
it
was
a
companion
case
to
coleman
versus
alabama.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
yes,
your
honor.
these
cases
are
somewhat
different
from
this
case
because
both
in
whitus
and
in
jones,
there
had
been
--
negroes
had
served
on
juries
and
the
attack
was
as
to
the
disparity.
and
you
see,
we
once
step
or
moved
from
there,
we're
one
step
stronger
than
that
because
they've
never
--
mr.
j.
brad
reed
your
honor
in
whitus,
the
tax
lists
were
marked
--
i
don't
remember
jones.
i'm
not
sure
if
you're
correct.
the
--
along
that
line,
the
petitioner,
i
mean
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
rely
on
that
line
of
reason
going
back
to
the
cassell
case
--
cassell
versus
texas
where
there
was
a
disparity
but
there
was
testimony
that
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
property
owners.
it
even
went
to
the
percentage
as
it
did
in
whitus
and
in
jones.
in
this
case,
there
has
not
been
any
testimony
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
own
property
without
any
qualifications
as
to
specific
percentages.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
a
smaller
percentage
of
negroes
were
property
owners
than
their
percentage
in
the
general
population
or
than
their
percentage
of
the
adult
males,
both
of
which
are
approved.
the
respondent
places
strong
reliance
on
the
case
of
kennedy
versus
the
state
decided
about
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
1949
or
‘50.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
shall
reserve
a
comment
on
that
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
brad
reed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
manner
that
the
court
may
have
are
completely
in
mind
but
i'm
not
sure
if
mr.
davies
does.
he
keeps
talking
about
the
fact
that
we
didn't
prove
there
were
any
qualified,
any
negroes
who
were
qualified
jurors.
if
i
may
quote
from
norris
versus
alabama
as
to
point
a
prima
facie
case
comes
into
effect,
maybe
this
will
help.
this
was
following
the
testimony
that
negroes
constituted
some
way
around,
well,
a
large
substantial
percent
of
the
population
and
that
none
had
ever
served.
the
court
then
says,
that
testimony
in
itself
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
of
equal
protection.
the
case
does
made
was
supplemented
by
direct
testimony
that
specified
negroes
who
qualify
and
that
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
not
part
of
my
case
to
prove
that
any
negroes
were
qualified
or
have
approved
years
that
they
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
and
that
none
had
ever
served.
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
question
for
this
reason.
i'm
reading
from
the
appendix
page
58,
the
district
court's
opinion,
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
well,
i
--
assuming
arguendo
that
the
clear
erroneous
rule
applies,
it
couldn't
be
anymore
clearly
erroneous.
he
then
goes
on
to
consider
the
other
evidence
having
held
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made
and
he
has
obviously
considered
the
evidence
in
the
wrong
light.
we're
not
asking
as
mr.
davies
implied
that
a
judge
forced
a
negro
to
serve.
in
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
scrupulously
avoid
such
a
suggestion.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
court
not
excuse
anybody,
white
or
negro
without
cause.
that's
all
we're
asking.
when
he
had
the
reason
that
they
have
never
served,
i
think
mr.
davies
was
exactly
right.
they've
always
--
on
the
record
shows
that
they've
always
asked
to
be
excused
whether
they
have
had
cause
or
not,
the
judge
is
excused
where
you
can
even-handedly
stop
that.
you
don't
require
negroes
to
do
anything
different
than
from
whites,
you
just
require
the
judge
to
not
excuse
someone
unless
there's
legal
excuse
or
legal
reason
for
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
statistics
in
this
case,
the
--
i
admit
there
is
a
problem,
i
didn't
represent
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
and
consequently,
i
have
attempted
to
use
presumptions
to
establish
some
of
the
figures.
i
think
that
we've
justified
in
doing
this
because
of
the
proof
in
the
record.
i
think
there's
sufficient
proof
in
the
record
to
show
how
many
negroes
were
on
a
particular
list.
the
best
evidence
of
this
in
fact
is
in
the
kennedy
case
which
mr.
davies
relies
on.
they
go
to
great
trouble
to
name
or
rather
to
list
a
number
of
negroes
on
the
general
venire
as
being
--
the
case
says
there
were
nine
negroes
out
of
a
110
where
two
of
them
were
dead
and
one
of
them
had
moved
out
the
county
and
so
i
think
we
put
it
well
not
count
those.
of
the
remaining
living
residence,
6.6%
of
the
list
of
a
hundred
or
in
this
106
were
negroes.
now,
we
have
shown
and
the
same
was
true
in
kennedy
who
has
no
proof
that
a
lesser
percentage
of
the
population
was
negro
or
rather
a
less
percentage
of
qualified
jurors
were
negroes.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
not
only
is
it
reasonable
to
assume,
the
court
must
assume
that
the
same
percentage
of
negroes
were
qualified
for
jury
duty
as
it
was
in
the
percentage
of
negro
adult
male
residents
of
the
county.
using
that
percentage,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
a
composition
of
a
venire
facias
of
a
hundred
or
106
containing
6.6%
negroes
would
happen
would
occur
at
random
list
in
once
in
a
million
times.
now,
we
submit
this
solely
to
show
that
the
selection
was
not
made
at
random.
the
supreme
court
said,
you
see
here,
this
evidence
shows
that
a
random
selection
or
shows
no
systematic
exclusion.
this
is
the
evidence
they
rely
on.
we
used
elementary;
it's
at
the
beginning
of
every
book
on
statistical
theory.
elementary
probability
theory
to
show
that
the
evidence
proper,
to
show
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion
doesn't
have
that
effect
at
all.
that's
the
only
way
we've
used
it
here.
thank
you,your
honor.
