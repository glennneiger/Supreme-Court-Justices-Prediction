justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
case
in
this
court
that
most
squarely
says
that
answers
yesterday's
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
square
holding
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
either
--
you
need
not
go
on
but
your
position
is
that
the
--
these
cases
squarely
construe
the
statute
to
exclude
the
other
type
of
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
one
thing
right,
but
do
you
think
they
have
--
do
you
think
they
--
these
cases
have
held
of
national
banks
would
simply
immune
because
their
federal
instrumentalities
or
have
they
held
that
they
are
immune
because
congress
has
set
them
to
be
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
did
they
would
be
immune
constitutionally
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
can
wave
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
basis
for
--
if
this
bank
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality
what's
the
congressional
basis
for
immunizing
a
national
bank
from
state
taxation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
i
know.
what
if
it
is
a
federal
instrumentality?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
isn't
automatic
that
just
because
it's
a
federal
instrumentality
it
doesn't
mean
it's
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
federal
instrumentality
for
the
purposes
of
giving
congress
the
power
to
immunize
it.
then
is
it
automatically
immune
from
--
unconstitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
again
now,
let's
assume
the
court
presided
in
its
own
mind
that
the
--
this
bank
wasn't
entitled
to
any
constitutional
immunity
and
then
you
come
to
the
statute
that
you
argue
that
that's
immunize
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
bank.
well
where
does
congress
get
to
parallel
immunize
the
national
bank
which
has
been
titled
to
a
constitutional
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
interstate
commerce
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
you
concede
that
the
court
has
squarely
construed
that
statute
to
exclude
other
form
of
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
has
it
ever
invalidated
the
tax
because
the
statute
immunizes
the
banks
from
the
kind
of
taxation
of
suddenly
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
these
taxes
were
invalidated
because
it
held
that
congress
had
intended
to
authorize
those
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
congress
intended
to
immunize
against
those
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
evidenced
by
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
know
that
situation
has
so
changed
about
banks
just
by
judicial
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
this
state
tax,
applied
to
federal
reserve
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
suggest
that
national
banks
perform
no
--
for
the
no
of
role
for
the
federal
government
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
some
role.
justice

yes,

what
if
