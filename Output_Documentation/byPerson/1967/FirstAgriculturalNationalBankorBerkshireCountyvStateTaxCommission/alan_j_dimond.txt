mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
look
briefly
at
the
record
in
this
case
to
see
some
of
the
purchases
at
which
the
bank
complains
even
though
the
same
purchases
when
made
by
neighbors
across
the
street
state
banks
to
not
entitle
those
banks
to
any
immunity.

of

and

including

now
what
is
the
structure
in
which
these
articles
are
housed?
reference
has
been
made
in
the
brief
to
an
arch
for
the
keystone
to
it,
supporting
it.
i
submit
that
the
keystone
that
supported
the
arch
of
constitutional
immunity
of
national
banks
from
state
taxation
has
long
been
removed
and
that
the
arch
or
the
structure
such
as
it
is
today
is
not
supported
by
any
keystone
such
as
that
which
was
originally
installed.
what
was
that
keystone?
the
keystone
was
a
bond
secured
currency.
the
bond
secured
bank
note
currency.
to
explain
this
proposition,
it's
necessary
to
go
back
the
time
of
the
creation
of
the
national
banks
during
the
civil
war.
there
were
two
purposes
which
i
think
all
financial
historians
accept
as
being
the
reasons
for
the
creation
of
the
--
what
is
now
known
as
the
national
bank
system.
one
was
to
establish
a
uniform
national
currency.
the
second
was
to
extend
the
market
for
government
bonds
solely
needed
in
1863
to
finance
of
the
civil
war.
as
for
the
uniform
currency,
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
having
gone
out
of
existence
when
its
charter
expired
in
1836
there
was
no
federally
chartered
bankin
existence
thereafter.
banking
was
wholly
in
the
hands
of
state
institutions.
these
institutions,
then
conducting
banking
in
the
way
in
which
banking
of
course
was
then
conducted
as
a
form
of
the
issuance
of
bank
notes
as
distinguished
from
the
creation
and
transfer
of
demand
deposits
which
is
now
distinctive
characteristic
of
commercial
banking.
prior
to
the
civil
war,
the
number
of
state
bank
notes
ran
into
to
thousands.
they
varied
in
value
from
state
to
state
and
within
the
same
state.
counterfeiting
of
the
notes
was
widespread.
so
much
so
that
counterfeiting
had
almost
become
a
hobby.
no
business
or
financial
institution
could
then
function
without
what
was
then
known
as
a
counterfeit
detective
in
the
office.
state
bank
notes
were
known
via
some
other
colorful
terms.
there
were
the
shinplasters
of
michigan
and
the
red
dogs
of
indiana
and
nebraska,
the
wild
cats
of
georgia
and
pennsylvania
and
the
stump-tails
of
illinois
and
wisconsin.
so
serious
was
the
irregularity
in
the
bank
note
system
that
demands
the
reform
came
from
many
sources,
chief
of
whom,
at
that
time
was
secretary
of
the
treasury
salmon
p.
chase.
when
december
of
1861
and
a
message
to
congress
urged
a
replacement
of
the
state
bank
notes
by
a
uniform
federal
bank
note
currency.
he
got
no
immediate
results
but
as
the
finances
of
the
north
worsen
during
the
civil
war
and
it
became
necessary
to
enlarge
the
market
for
the
government
bonds
then
issued
or
to
be
issued
by
the
north,
a
combination
of
chase's
objective
and
the
fiscal
needs
of
the
treasury
were
then
joined
so
as
to
create
what
was
known
as
the
national
currency
act
of
1863.
under
this
act,
five
or
more
persons
could
organize
what
were
known
as
national
banking
associations.
by
depositing
with
the
treasurer
or
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
certain
government
bonds
to
hold
a
security
for
the
issuance
of
bank
notes
which
would
then
be
entitled
to
qualify
as
legal
tender
throughout
the
country,
the
bonds
which
are
eligible
for
deposit
were
said
or
since
said
to
have
had
was
known
as
the
circulation
privilege.
the
national
currency
act
was
amended
and
replaced
in
1864
but
without
significant
change
in
the
essential
characteristic
that
it
originally
had
namely
the
issuance
of
a
bond
secured
currency.
now,
the
national
bank
currency
thereafter
had
an
interesting
and
not
very
edifying
history.
much
has
been
written
about
its
defects,
chief
of
which
was
its
so-called
inelasticity.
that
is,
its
inability
to
expand
or
contract
according
to
the
needs
of
business
and
agriculture.
when
time
look
good,
the
banks
consider
buying
more
bonds
as
a
base
for
augmenting
the
bank
note
issue
would
put
their
money
to
other
purposes
so
that
at
the
very
time
that
an
augmented
currency
was
needed
to
meet
the
expense
--
expanding
demands
of
industry
and
agriculture,
the
currency
was
not
there.
although
it
might
be
an
overstatement
to
say
that
this
inelasticity
brought
on
the
panics
of
1873
or
1884
or
1903
or
1893
or
1907,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
reading
from
his
financial
historians
that
the
national
bank
note
currency
due
to
its
inelasticity
and
it
was
also
sometimes
called
its
reversed
elasticity
seriously
intensified
the
crisis
and
the
money
panics
once
they
had
started.
after
the
panic
of
1907,
country
had
just
about
had
enough.
in
that
year
the
national
monetary
commission
was
established
and
in
a
series
of
studies
which
number
over
20
volumes
made
an
intensive
study
of
banking
practices
both
here
and
abroad.
commission
filed
its
report
in
1912,
finding
many
inadequacies
in
the
existing
banking
structure
of
this
country.
many
of
which
of
course
had
often
been
noted
the
immobility
of
reserves,
scattering
of
reserves,
the
lack
of
any
centralized
control
over
reserve
--
banking
reserves.
but
among
the
chief
defects
found
in
the
existing
banking
system
was
the
national
bank
note
currency
which
was
indicted
by
the
national
monetary
commission
or
its
inelasticity
as
i
have
just
described
it.
the
result
of
course
of
the
national
monetary
commission's
work
was
the
enactment
of
the
federal
reserve
act
in
1913.
worth
not
for
the
threat
and
danger
causing
a
serious
loss
on
the
bonds
that
have
the
circulation
privilege,
the
federal
reserve
act
would
have
abolished
the
national
bank
notes
in
that
year.
as
it
was,
the
federal
reserve
act
of
course
created
a
new
form
of
bank
note
currency
with
greater
elasticity
federal
reserve
notes.
it
was
anticipated,
however,
that
the
national
bank
notes
would
be
retired
in
due
course
and
indeed
in
1935
they
were
so
retired.
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
called
in
for
redemption,
all
bonds
then
possessing
the
circulation
privilege,
the
result
was
that
from
1935
on
national
banks
have
seized
to
have
their
originally
distinctive
function
namely
the
issuance
of
bank
notes.
any
national
bank
notes
now
in
circulation
are
simply
those
notes
which
have
not
been
turned
in
for
redemption.
the
--
if
any
distinction
now
exists
between
the
national
banks
and
the
state
banks,
it
is
simply
that
they
are
each
subject
to
different
supervisory
agencies
and
even
the
state
banks
today
are
subject
to
such
a
variety
of
federal
controls
that
to
speak
of
our
dual
banking
system
is
it
sometimes
called
--
is
actually
and
is
nowhere
we
have
today
federal
reserve
system,
we
have
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
all
exercising
controls
of
various
sorts
of

of
the

well

has

mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
have
not
gone
as
far
as
your
honor
suggests,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
goes
that
far.
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
anticipate
that
under
the
necessary
improper
clause,
congress
might
extend
548
to
national
banks
even
though
they
do
not
enjoy
constitutional
immunity
so
that
it
is
conceivable
that
the
absence
of
a
constitution
immunity
and
the
reach
of
548
to
national
banks
that
was
standing
immunity
might
co-exist.
but
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
well,
the
--
he
started
that
one
end
of
the
street
and
i've
started
at
the
other.
i
would
try
to
get
to
the
middle
of
the
street
if
i
may.
the
interpretation
of
section
548
which
is
relied
on
here
by
the
appellant
is
one
that
is
so
interwoven
with
this
concept
of
immunity
that
i
think
it
cannot
be
adequately
comprehended
without
some
attempt
as
i
am
tried
to
do
perhaps
to
show
that
the
constitutional
underpinnings
have
been
eroded.
if
the
548
is
read
as
it
is
written,
there
is
absolutely
no
language
of
immunity
contained
in
it.
there
has
been
concededly
a
traditional
gloss
placed
on
it
over
the
years.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
has
done
it
in
terms
--
in
these
terms
your
honor.
it's
done
it
by
making
some
broad
statements
to
that
effect
but
it's
done
it
in
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
is
done
so
your
honor
in
circumstances
where
the
tax
sought
to
be
imposed
as
had
a
direct
effect
shall
we
say
on
the
value
of
an
investment
in
a
national
bank
as
compared
to
the
investment
in
other
forms
of
moneyed
capital.
all
these
cases
in
which
the
broad
statements
of
immunity
had
been
made,
have
been
cases
which
have
with
the
exception
of
owensboro
i
believe,
have
dealt
with
a
discriminatory
form
of
taxation.
they've
all
been
cases
which
have
dealt
with
investments
in
national
banks,
has
dealt
with
their
franchises,
their
income,
things
which
directly
are
related
to
what
an
investor
would
be
concerned
about
when
he
would
be
--
making
a
decision
as
to
whether
to
invest
in
a
national
bank
as
against
a
state
bank.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
the
cases
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
immunize
against
those
actually.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
and
quite
frankly,
we
are
attempting
today
to
ask
the
court
to
reexamine
some
of
those
decisions
to
conclude
that
they
have
stated
rules
that
are
much
to
sweeping,
that
they
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
in
some
circumstances
that
would
be
so
your
honor.
if
it
could
be
said
that
an
existing
form
of
business
or
industry
has
structured
itself
in
reliance
on
those
interpretations.
there
are
many
situations
where
of
course
such
position
would
be
warranted.
here,
however,
we
are
dealing
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
won't
say,
only
then
i
think
that
is
a
factor
that
would
be
considered
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
what
we've
attempted
to
document
the
change
in
our
brief,
there
is
i
believe
references
to
the
various
sources
which
indicate
the
fundamental
change
in
the
character
of
national
banks
so
that
today
there's
simply
ordinary
private
commercial
institution
say
perform
no
significant
fiscal
or
monetary
function
for
the
federal
government.
it
has
been
suggested
that
they
are
so
imminently
connected
with
the
federal
reserve
system
that
they
should
be
given
an
immunity
on
that
ground.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
think
every
item
of
history
that
i've
cited
here
your
honor
is
generally
familiar.
on
the
other
hand,
i
respectfully
submit
some
of
it
is
not
as
well-known
as
it
should
be.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
well
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
congress
has
not
and
i
think
it
has
--
once
again,
not
had
occasion
to
do
it.
there
was
reference
made
to
the
1950
bill.
i
am
curious,
that
bill
--
everybody
wanted
the
bill
to
pass
in
putting
the
banks.
so
there
was
no
opposition
to
it.
it
just
seems
to
dive
on
legislative
process.
so
this
is
something
that
you
can't
say
congress
has
been
opposed
that
this
based
on
the
1950
episode
that
has
been
referred
to
you.
it
just
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
no
your
honor,
because
they
are
specifically
exempt
by
act
of
congress
from
state
taxation.
the
word
of
exemption
is
used
in
the
federal
reserve
act
with
respect
to
state
taxation.
our
position
here
is
that
section
548
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
an
exemption.
it
speaks
wholly
in
terms
of
a
regulation
of
the
types
of
taxation
enumerated
in
section
548.
now,
may
i
say
this.
when
548
was
first
passed
which
i
took
the
form
of
proviso
in
section
41
i
believe
it
was
of
the
currency
act
of
1864.
it
was
cast
in
the
form
that
it
was
i
submit
for
two
reasons.
one
was
the
nature
of
state
taxation
in
those
days
and
the
other
was
the
continuing
vitality
of
an
important
reservation
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
in
1864,
the
only
type
of
state
taxation
of
any
consequence
was
the
local
property
tax.
so
that
when
congress
adopted
this
proviso
which
was
all
that
it
was
in
1864,
it
was
thinking
only
in
terms
of
the
local
property
tax
and
i
believe
i've
documented
that
statement
in
a
brief.
as
for
the
reservation
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
there
is
an
important
statement
in
that
case
which
i
believe
is
often
gone
unnoticed
where
chief
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
nothing
in
that
decision
was
to
prevent
local
taxation
of
the
property
of
national
banks.
and
may
i
say
this
--
i
should
say
--
no
i
shouldn't
say
national
banks,
i
should
say
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
which
was
a
true
federal
instrumentality
certainly
significantly
different
from
the
national
banks
as
we
know
them
today.
and
may
i
say
this
further
with
respect
to
mcculloch
versus
maryland
because
i
think
this
is
important.
the
reference
to
which
that
case
is
given
--
which
is
given
to
that
case
is
based
on
the
centrally
--
because
of
its
enunciation
of
the
implied
powers
doctrine
and
doctrine
of
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution.
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
chief
justice
marshall
said
that
it
wasn't
even
worth
discussing
whether
or
not
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
was
a
true
federal
instrumentality
because
at
that
time,
in
view
of
its
history
and
its
functions,
it
was
a
true
agent,
fiscal
agent
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
in
osborn
against
the
bank
of
the
united
states
a
few
years
later
when
factual
examination
of
the
second
bank
was
considered
more
fully,
chief
justice
marshall
again
stated
almost
summarily.
his
words
were
that
the
banks
exercise
of
these,
its
banking
faculties
greatly
facilitates
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
is
too
obvious
for
controversy.
well
it's
not
too
obvious
for
controversy
today
your
honors.
it's
an
entirely
different
banking
system.
it's
an
entirely
different
bank.
and
as
far
as
section
548
is
concerned,
may
i
just
point
out
this.
this
is
not
the
first
time,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
the
last
that
a
litigant
has
attempted
to
use
the
shield
as
a
sword.
548,
historically,
was
designed
to
prevent
discrimination
against
the
national
banks.
it
was
not
designed
to
give
the
national
banks
a
preference
over
their
competitors,
the
state
banks.
and
this
is
what
the
appellant
here
–-
mr.
alan

no
role
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
than
being
given
a
constitutional
immunity

mr.

they
perform
some
role,
yes.
but
the
same
as
many
other
(voice

--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
--
as
i
say,
i
would
--
i've
suggested
as
a
possibility.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
that
may
necessarily
be
a
valid
ground
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
no,
i'm
not
challenging
you.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
have
not
your
honor
in
my
brief.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
very
minor
in
terms
of
the
criteria
which
this
court
has
in
recent
years
established
for
the
enjoyment
by
an
organization
of
a
constitutional
immunity.
i
think
we
have
--
we
might
have
one
standard
with
regard
to
the
--
say
the
necessary
improper
clause,
i
think
we
have
an
entirely
different
standard
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
immunity.
and
under
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
immunities
are
very,
very
carefully
restricted.
this
is
not
a
time
when
intergovernmental
immunities
should
be
extended
and
i
respectfully
point
out
that
the
essence
of
the
banks'
argument
here
today
is
really
that
they
are
asking
for
the
creation
of
a
new
immunity,
because
they
in
effect
acknowledge
as
i
read
their
argument
that
the
old
grounds
have
disappeared.
your
honors,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
look
briefly
at
the
record
in
this
case
to
see
some
of
the
purchases
at
which
the
bank
complains
even
though
the
same
purchases
when
made
by
neighbors
across
the
street
state
banks
to
not
entitle
those
banks
to
any
immunity.

now
what
is
the
structure
in
which
these
articles
are
housed?
reference
has
been
made
in
the
brief
to
an
arch
for
the
keystone
to
it,
supporting
it.
i
submit
that
the
keystone
that
supported
the
arch
of
constitutional
immunity
of
national
banks
from
state
taxation
has
long
been
removed
and
that
the
arch
or
the
structure
such
as
it
is
today
is
not
supported
by
any
keystone
such
as
that
which
was
originally
installed.
what
was
that
keystone?
the
keystone
was
a
bond
secured
currency.
the
bond
secured
bank
note
currency.
to
explain
this
proposition,
it's
necessary
to
go
back
the
time
of
the
creation
of
the
national
banks
during
the
civil
war.
there
were
two
purposes
which
i
think
all
financial
historians
accept
as
being
the
reasons
for
the
creation
of
the
--
what
is
now
known
as
the
national
bank
system.
one
was
to
establish
a
uniform
national
currency.
the
second
was
to
extend
the
market
for
government
bonds
solely
needed
in
1863
to
finance
of
the
civil
war.
as
for
the
uniform
currency,
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
having
gone
out
of
existence
when
its
charter
expired
in
1836
there
was
no
federally
chartered
bankin
existence
thereafter.
banking
was
wholly
in
the
hands
of
state
institutions.
these
institutions,
then
conducting
banking
in
the
way
in
which
banking
of
course
was
then
conducted
as
a
form
of
the
issuance
of
bank
notes
as
distinguished
from
the
creation
and
transfer
of
demand
deposits
which
is
now
distinctive
characteristic
of
commercial
banking.
prior
to
the
civil
war,
the
number
of
state
bank
notes
ran
into
to
thousands.
they
varied
in
value
from
state
to
state
and
within
the
same
state.
counterfeiting
of
the
notes
was
widespread.
so
much
so
that
counterfeiting
had
almost
become
a
hobby.
no
business
or
financial
institution
could
then
function
without
what
was
then
known
as
a
counterfeit
detective
in
the
office.
state
bank
notes
were
known
via
some
other
colorful
terms.
there
were
the
shinplasters
of
michigan
and
the
red
dogs
of
indiana
and
nebraska,
the
wild
cats
of
georgia
and
pennsylvania
and
the
stump-tails
of
illinois
and
wisconsin.
so
serious
was
the
irregularity
in
the
bank
note
system
that
demands
the
reform
came
from
many
sources,
chief
of
whom,
at
that
time
was
secretary
of
the
treasury
salmon
p.
chase.
when
december
of
1861
and
a
message
to
congress
urged
a
replacement
of
the
state
bank
notes
by
a
uniform
federal
bank
note
currency.
he
got
no
immediate
results
but
as
the
finances
of
the
north
worsen
during
the
civil
war
and
it
became
necessary
to
enlarge
the
market
for
the
government
bonds
then
issued
or
to
be
issued
by
the
north,
a
combination
of
chase's
objective
and
the
fiscal
needs
of
the
treasury
were
then
joined
so
as
to
create
what
was
known
as
the
national
currency
act
of
1863.
under
this
act,
five
or
more
persons
could
organize
what
were
known
as
national
banking
associations.
by
depositing
with
the
treasurer
or
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
certain
government
bonds
to
hold
a
security
for
the
issuance
of
bank
notes
which
would
then
be
entitled
to
qualify
as
legal
tender
throughout
the
country,
the
bonds
which
are
eligible
for
deposit
were
said
or
since
said
to
have
had
was
known
as
the
circulation
privilege.
the
national
currency
act
was
amended
and
replaced
in
1864
but
without
significant
change
in
the
essential
characteristic
that
it
originally
had
namely
the
issuance
of
a
bond
secured
currency.
now,
the
national
bank
currency
thereafter
had
an
interesting
and
not
very
edifying
history.
much
has
been
written
about
its
defects,
chief
of
which
was
its
so-called
inelasticity.
that
is,
its
inability
to
expand
or
contract
according
to
the
needs
of
business
and
agriculture.
when
time
look
good,
the
banks
consider
buying
more
bonds
as
a
base
for
augmenting
the
bank
note
issue
would
put
their
money
to
other
purposes
so
that
at
the
very
time
that
an
augmented
currency
was
needed
to
meet
the
expense
--
expanding
demands
of
industry
and
agriculture,
the
currency
was
not
there.
although
it
might
be
an
overstatement
to
say
that
this
inelasticity
brought
on
the
panics
of
1873
or
1884
or
1903
or
1893
or
1907,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
reading
from
his
financial
historians
that
the
national
bank
note
currency
due
to
its
inelasticity
and
it
was
also
sometimes
called
its
reversed
elasticity
seriously
intensified
the
crisis
and
the
money
panics
once
they
had
started.
after
the
panic
of
1907,
country
had
just
about
had
enough.
in
that
year
the
national
monetary
commission
was
established
and
in
a
series
of
studies
which
number
over
20
volumes
made
an
intensive
study
of
banking
practices
both
here
and
abroad.
commission
filed
its
report
in
1912,
finding
many
inadequacies
in
the
existing
banking
structure
of
this
country.
many
of
which
of
course
had
often
been
noted
the
immobility
of
reserves,
scattering
of
reserves,
the
lack
of
any
centralized
control
over
reserve
--
banking
reserves.
but
among
the
chief
defects
found
in
the
existing
banking
system
was
the
national
bank
note
currency
which
was
indicted
by
the
national
monetary
commission
or
its
inelasticity
as
i
have
just
described
it.
the
result
of
course
of
the
national
monetary
commission's
work
was
the
enactment
of
the
federal
reserve
act
in
1913.
worth
not
for
the
threat
and
danger
causing
a
serious
loss
on
the
bonds
that
have
the
circulation
privilege,
the
federal
reserve
act
would
have
abolished
the
national
bank
notes
in
that
year.
as
it
was,
the
federal
reserve
act
of
course
created
a
new
form
of
bank
note
currency
with
greater
elasticity
federal
reserve
notes.
it
was
anticipated,
however,
that
the
national
bank
notes
would
be
retired
in
due
course
and
indeed
in
1935
they
were
so
retired.
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
called
in
for
redemption,
all
bonds
then
possessing
the
circulation
privilege,
the
result
was
that
from
1935
on
national
banks
have
seized
to
have
their
originally
distinctive
function
namely
the
issuance
of
bank
notes.
any
national
bank
notes
now
in
circulation
are
simply
those
notes
which
have
not
been
turned
in
for
redemption.
the
--
if
any
distinction
now
exists
between
the
national
banks
and
the
state
banks,
it
is
simply
that
they
are
each
subject
to
different
supervisory
agencies
and
even
the
state
banks
today
are
subject
to
such
a
variety
of
federal
controls
that
to
speak
of
our
dual
banking
system
is
it
sometimes
called
--
is
actually
and
is
nowhere
we
have
today
federal
reserve
system,
we
have
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
all
exercising
controls
of
various
sorts
of
both

of
the

well

has

mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
have
not
gone
as
far
as
your
honor
suggests,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
goes
that
far.
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
anticipate
that
under
the
necessary
improper
clause,
congress
might
extend
548
to
national
banks
even
though
they
do
not
enjoy
constitutional
immunity
so
that
it
is
conceivable
that
the
absence
of
a
constitution
immunity
and
the
reach
of
548
to
national
banks
that
was
standing
immunity
might
co-exist.
but
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
well,
the
--
he
started
that
one
end
of
the
street
and
i've
started
at
the
other.
i
would
try
to
get
to
the
middle
of
the
street
if
i
may.
the
interpretation
of
section
548
which
is
relied
on
here
by
the
appellant
is
one
that
is
so
interwoven
with
this
concept
of
immunity
that
i
think
it
cannot
be
adequately
comprehended
without
some
attempt
as
i
am
tried
to
do
perhaps
to
show
that
the
constitutional
underpinnings
have
been
eroded.
if
the
548
is
read
as
it
is
written,
there
is
absolutely
no
language
of
immunity
contained
in
it.
there
has
been
concededly
a
traditional
gloss
placed
on
it
over
the
years.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
has
done
it
in
terms
--
in
these
terms
your
honor.
it's
done
it
by
making
some
broad
statements
to
that
effect
but
it's
done
it
in
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
it
is
done
so
your
honor
in
circumstances
where
the
tax
sought
to
be
imposed
as
had
a
direct
effect
shall
we
say
on
the
value
of
an
investment
in
a
national
bank
as
compared
to
the
investment
in
other
forms
of
moneyed
capital.
all
these
cases
in
which
the
broad
statements
of
immunity
had
been
made,
have
been
cases
which
have
with
the
exception
of
owensboro
i
believe,
have
dealt
with
a
discriminatory
form
of
taxation.
they've
all
been
cases
which
have
dealt
with
investments
in
national
banks,
has
dealt
with
their
franchises,
their
income,
things
which
directly
are
related
to
what
an
investor
would
be
concerned
about
when
he
would
be
--
making
a
decision
as
to
whether
to
invest
in
a
national
bank
as
against
a
state
bank.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
the
cases
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
immunize
against
those
actually.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
and
quite
frankly,
we
are
attempting
today
to
ask
the
court
to
reexamine
some
of
those
decisions
to
conclude
that
they
have
stated
rules
that
are
much
to
sweeping,
that
they
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
in
some
circumstances
that
would
be
so
your
honor.
if
it
could
be
said
that
an
existing
form
of
business
or
industry
has
structured
itself
in
reliance
on
those
interpretations.
there
are
many
situations
where
of
course
such
position
would
be
warranted.
here,
however,
we
are
dealing
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
won't
say,
only
then
i
think
that
is
a
factor
that
would
be
considered
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
what
we've
attempted
to
document
the
change
in
our
brief,
there
is
i
believe
references
to
the
various
sources
which
indicate
the
fundamental
change
in
the
character
of
national
banks
so
that
today
there's
simply
ordinary
private
commercial
institution
say
perform
no
significant
fiscal
or
monetary
function
for
the
federal
government.
it
has
been
suggested
that
they
are
so
imminently
connected
with
the
federal
reserve
system
that
they
should
be
given
an
immunity
on
that
ground.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
think
every
item
of
history
that
i've
cited
here
your
honor
is
generally
familiar.
on
the
other
hand,
i
respectfully
submit
some
of
it
is
not
as
well-known
as
it
should
be.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
well
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
congress
has
not
and
i
think
it
has
--
once
again,
not
had
occasion
to
do
it.
there
was
reference
made
to
the
1950
bill.
i
am
curious,
that
bill
--
everybody
wanted
the
bill
to
pass
in
putting
the
banks.
so
there
was
no
opposition
to
it.
it
just
seems
to
dive
on
legislative
process.
so
this
is
something
that
you
can't
say
congress
has
been
opposed
that
this
based
on
the
1950
episode
that
has
been
referred
to
you.
it
just
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
no
your
honor,
because
they
are
specifically
exempt
by
act
of
congress
from
state
taxation.
the
word
of
exemption
is
used
in
the
federal
reserve
act
with
respect
to
state
taxation.
our
position
here
is
that
section
548
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
an
exemption.
it
speaks
wholly
in
terms
of
a
regulation
of
the
types
of
taxation
enumerated
in
section
548.
now,
may
i
say
this.
when
548
was
first
passed
which
i
took
the
form
of
proviso
in
section
41
i
believe
it
was
of
the
currency
act
of
1864.
it
was
cast
in
the
form
that
it
was
i
submit
for
two
reasons.
one
was
the
nature
of
state
taxation
in
those
days
and
the
other
was
the
continuing
vitality
of
an
important
reservation
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
in
1864,
the
only
type
of
state
taxation
of
any
consequence
was
the
local
property
tax.
so
that
when
congress
adopted
this
proviso
which
was
all
that
it
was
in
1864,
it
was
thinking
only
in
terms
of
the
local
property
tax
and
i
believe
i've
documented
that
statement
in
a
brief.
as
for
the
reservation
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
there
is
an
important
statement
in
that
case
which
i
believe
is
often
gone
unnoticed
where
chief
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
nothing
in
that
decision
was
to
prevent
local
taxation
of
the
property
of
national
banks.
and
may
i
say
this
--
i
should
say
--
no
i
shouldn't
say
national
banks,
i
should
say
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
which
was
a
true
federal
instrumentality
certainly
significantly
different
from
the
national
banks
as
we
know
them
today.
and
may
i
say
this
further
with
respect
to
mcculloch
versus
maryland
because
i
think
this
is
important.
the
reference
to
which
that
case
is
given
--
which
is
given
to
that
case
is
based
on
the
centrally
--
because
of
its
enunciation
of
the
implied
powers
doctrine
and
doctrine
of
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution.
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
chief
justice
marshall
said
that
it
wasn't
even
worth
discussing
whether
or
not
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
was
a
true
federal
instrumentality
because
at
that
time,
in
view
of
its
history
and
its
functions,
it
was
a
true
agent,
fiscal
agent
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
in
osborn
against
the
bank
of
the
united
states
a
few
years
later
when
factual
examination
of
the
second
bank
was
considered
more
fully,
chief
justice
marshall
again
stated
almost
summarily.
his
words
were
that
the
banks
exercise
of
these,
its
banking
faculties
greatly
facilitates
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
is
too
obvious
for
controversy.
well
it's
not
too
obvious
for
controversy
today
your
honors.
it's
an
entirely
different
banking
system.
it's
an
entirely
different
bank.
and
as
far
as
section
548
is
concerned,
may
i
just
point
out
this.
this
is
not
the
first
time,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
the
last
that
a
litigant
has
attempted
to
use
the
shield
as
a
sword.
548,
historically,
was
designed
to
prevent
discrimination
against
the
national
banks.
it
was
not
designed
to
give
the
national
banks
a
preference
over
their
competitors,
the
state
banks.
and
this
is
what
the
appellant
here
–-
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
no
role
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
than
being
given
a
constitutional
immunity
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
they
perform
some
role,
yes.
but
the
same
as
many
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
--
as
i
say,
i
would
--
i've
suggested
as
a
possibility.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
that
may
necessarily
be
a
valid
ground
--
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
no,
i'm
not
challenging
you.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
i
have
not
your
honor
in
my
brief.
mr.
alan
j.
dimond
very
minor
in
terms
of
the
criteria
which
this
court
has
in
recent
years
established
for
the
enjoyment
by
an
organization
of
a
constitutional
immunity.
i
think
we
have
--
we
might
have
one
standard
with
regard
to
the
--
say
the
necessary
improper
clause,
i
think
we
have
an
entirely
different
standard
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
immunity.
and
under
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
immunities
are
very,
very
carefully
restricted.
this
is
not
a
time
when
intergovernmental
immunities
should
be
extended
and
i
respectfully
point
out
that
the
essence
of
the
banks'
argument
here
today
is
really
that
they
are
asking
for
the
creation
of
a
new
immunity,
because
they
in
effect
acknowledge
as
i
read
their
argument
that
the
old
grounds
have
disappeared.
your
honors,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
