you

548
by
its

seems

the
matter
in
which
the
state
may
tax
the

the

prohibit

power
to

justice

i
suppose
your
argument
would
be
that
if
it
didn't
cover
much,
much
more
than
that
there
would
be
no
reason
at
all
from
putting
any
paragraph
like
paragraph
three
which
says
that
nothing
here
in
contained
shall
be
deemed
to
prohibit
a
state
from
taxing
the
real
estate
of
a

justice

that
would
be
an
entirely
unnecessary
if
all
the
statute
were
directed
where
the
matter
at

justice

mr.
dimond,
i
understand
that
the
trust
of
what
you've
been
telling
us
is
to
show
the
difference
between
what
national
banks
are
today
and
what
they
were
today
as
of
mcculloch
against
maryland
or
even
in
the
days
of
1864
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
prior
to
1913,
which
goes
i
supposed
to
the
constitutionality
of
state
imposing
nondiscriminatory
taxes
upon
national
banks
in
1968.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
mean
that
if
congress
--
if
this
is
mean
that
if
section
548
means
what
your
opponent
says
it
means
is,
that
is
that
congress
has
given
permission
to
states
to
tax
national
banks
only
in
certain
specified
ways
that
that
act
of
congress
is
not
within
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
to
constitutionally
or
what
does
it
mean?
in
other

does
your
argument
go
at
all
to
the
--
to
your
opponent's
argument
based
on
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
because
as
i
understood,
your
brother's
argument
on
the
other
side
it
was
primarily
bottomed
down
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
statute
means
what
he
says
it
means
then
that
wins
the
case
for
him
unless
there's
some
reason
that
statute
was
not
within

for
some
reason
that
statute
is
not
constitutionally
there

it
was

constitutional
provision.
