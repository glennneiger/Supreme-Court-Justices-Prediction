mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant,
the
first
agricultural
national
bank
of
berkshire
county
is
a
national
bank
chartered
under
title
12,
the
united
states
code
as
such
just
one
of
19
national
banks
conducting
banking
operations
in
the
commonwealth.
for
over
two
years,
it
has
paid
under
protest,
massachusetts
sales
and
use
taxes
on
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
for
its
own
use.
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
statute
of
the
appellant
request
of
the
appellee,
the
state
tax
commission,
for
a
ruling
or
an
emergency
regulation
that
it
was
exempt
from
these
taxes,
no
such
ruling
was
issued.
however,
emergency
regulation
number
6
was
promulgated
which
stated
that
the
sales
lease
or
rental
of
tangible
personal
property
of
the
national
banks
and
to
federal
savings
and
home
loan
associations
was
subject
to
the
sales
and
use
taxes.
the
appellant
filed
a
fail
for
declaratory
release
seeking
in
substance
that
it
was
exempt
from
these
taxes.
the
case
was
reserved
and
reported
without
decision
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
for
the
issues
which
are
raised
on
this
appeal
were
passed
on
by
that
court.
there
are
five
issues
in
the
case.
two
of
them
relate
to
the
nature
of
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
and
one
of
the
natures
of
that
tax
is
probably
reviewable
by
this
court.
three
of
them
relate
to
the
tax
immune
status
of
the
national
banks.
the
third
--
the
first
is
whether
section
548
of
title
12
prohibits
the
imposition
of
a
sales
and
use
tax
on
purchases
by
the
appellant.
if
this
court
should
decide
that
issue
affirmative
why
then
none
of
the
other
tax
immunity
issues
need
be
reached.
if,
however,
this
court
should
decide
as
the
appellant
submits
it
should
not,
that
section
548
is
a
purely
permissive
statute.
why
then
the
second
immunity
issue
is
raised,
that
is
whether
after
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
at
a
several
states
are
wholly
without
power
to
levy
any
tax
direct
or
indirect
on
national
banks
except
as
congress
permits,
whether
those
decisions
should
be
reexamined.
only
if
this
court
should
decide
that
these
decisions
should
be
sole
reexamined
is
the
pure
constitution
--
constitutional
issue
presented.
that
is
whether
national
banks,
the
federal
instrumentalities
should
continue
to
enjoy
the
constitutional
protection
from
state
taxation,
again,
except
this
congress
permits.
inherent
in
the
nature
of
our
federalism,
is
a
necessity
of
accommodating
the
affairs
of
the
nation
and
the
power
of
the
several
states
to
tax.
congress
is
fashioned
its
accommodation
in
section
548.
section
548
provides
that
the
several
states
can
levy
taxes
on
national
bank
shares,
dividends
there
from
and
on
the
income
of
national
banks
and
taxes
measured
by
a
recording
the
income
of
these
banks
in
addition
to
real
estate
taxes.
section
548
does
not
permit
the
levying
of
a
sales
and
use
tax.
despite
the
language
of
section
548
and
despite
the
overwhelming
authority
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
appellee
now
urges
upon
this
court
that
the
appellant
is
subject
to
state
sales
and
use
taxes.
the
original
predecessor
to
section
548
was
enacted
in
1864,
one
year
after
the
national
banking
system
was
created.
the
debates
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
section
indicate
that
the
congress
was
well
aware
that
it
was
making
a
decision
into
determining
the
sculpt
of
permissible
state
taxation
of
national
banks
which
was
a
purely
legislative
market
and
was
not
one
of
constitutional
dimension.
for
example,
one
of
the
objects
of
the
1864
legislation
was
to
encourage
the
conversion
of
not
state
banks
international
banks.
congress
knew
that
any
types
of
protection
for
the
national
banks
would
encourage
such
conversions.
this
objective
is
of
course
one
of
legislator
policy.
the
congressional
debates
further
indicate
that
the
congress
is
well
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
of
the
constitutional
provision
against
a
tax
on
national
banks.
for
this
reason,
we're
fully
conscious
that
in
setting
forth
the
permissible
mode
of
state
taxation
they
were
determining
the
outer
limits
beyond
which
the
state
could
not
tax.
subsequent
legislative
activity
with
respect
to
section
548
confirms
this.
in
1923,
an
amendment
was
enacted
which
permitted
the
several
states
to
tax
the
dividends
and
the
income
of
national
banks
the
original
predecessor
had
only
permitted
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares
in
real
estate
--
in
the
real
estate
of
the
banks.
in
1926,
the
amendment
was
passed
which
authorized
the
states
to
levy
excise
and
franchise
taxes.
in
1935,
the
congress
subjected
national
banks
to
state
unemployment
taxes.
in
short,
congress
has
always
seen
fit
to
carefully
define
the
precise
scope
of
state
taxation
of
these
banks.
it
has
never
seen
to
authorize
and
subject
the
national
banks
to
general
state
taxation.
in
1950,
the
congress
rejected
a
bill
which
would
have
expressly
authorized
the
taxation
of
the
purchases
of
national
banks
under
state
sales
and
use
taxes.
this
bill
never
became
law.
the
decision
below
is
in
effect
an
attempt
to
resurrect
and
judicially
enact
that
bill.
in
so
doing
the
court
below
relied
on
the
cannon
of
construction
that
tax
immunity
is
not
to
be
granted
by
implication.
but
the
case
has
relied
on
or
in
opposite.
either
they
are
not
cases
of
statutory
construction
or
they
aren't
cases
where
a
statutory
immunity
was
conferred,
a
limited
immunity.
and
the
issue
was
whether
that
immunity
should
be
extended
by
implication.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
a
far
different
matter.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
congress
by
expressly
authorizing
four
casually
defined
methods
of
taxation,
intended
that
other
such
methods
of
taxation
should
be
prohibited.
moreover,
resort
to
that
judicial
kind
of
construction
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
case
starting
–
a
line
of
decisions
starting
with
owensboro
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes,
they
are
square
holdings.
owensboro,
bank
of
california
versus
richardson,
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
des
moines
national
bank
versus
fairweather,
first
national
bank
of
guthrie
center
versus
anderson.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
position
we
take
is
that
this
is
perfectly
clear.
they
have
in
citing
the
statute,
they
have
always
stated
unequivocally
and
--
and
without
any
intimation
to
the
contrary
and
the
over
century
that
this
court
has
construed
this
section
that
except
for
the
permissive
legislation
of
congress,
the
states
are
wholly
without
power
to
levy
a
tax.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
think
that
the
cases
of
--
are
subject
to
both
interpretations
that
the
--
they
can
be
construed
as
holding
one
that
section
548
as
a
legislative
matter,
has
defined
the
scope
beyond
which
states
cannot
tax
national
banks.
i
further
submit
that
they
are
also
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
whether
they
would
be
immune
constitutionally
or
not,
and
this
is
the
first
proposition
upon
which
we
were
relying.
those
cases
i
think
can
also
be
right
standing
for
the
proposition
that
--
where
it
not
so
permissive
legislation
of
congress.
the
national
banks
could
not
be
taxed
because
it
was
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
would
not
like
be
in
a
position
of
having
in
advance
with
that
argument.
our
position
is
that
if
congress
had
authorized
the
state
taxation
of
national
banks,
why
of
that
--
by
means
of
a
sales
and
use
tax
well
that's
actually
perfectly
--
would
be
perfectly
okay.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that's
exactly
right.
and
congress
can
prohibit
the
taxation
of
national
banks
as
it
sees
fit.
the
court,
as
i
mentioned,
relied
on
this
cannon
of
construction
that
immunity
is
not
to
be
extended
by
implication
as
we
suggest
the
cases
are
in
opposite
and
they
do
not
present
a
statute
where
four
carefully
defined
modes
were
permitted.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
this,
by
utilizing
that
cannon
of
construction,
it
would
require
an
expressed
provision
in
section
548.
but
the
requirement
of
an
expressed
provision
in
section
548
is
exactly
what
this
court
in
its
decisions
has
made
superfluous
and
this
approaches
judicial
legislation
in
the
form
of
judicial
construction.
the
analysis
is
somewhat
disturbing.
the
result
is
we
submitted
even
more
so.
now,
under
section
548,
if
a
statement
of
levy
one
of
the
four
permissible
taxes,
why
would
have
to
make
some
very
complicated
criteria
relating
to
whether
it
was
taxing
at
a
rate
higher
than
or
rate
of
money
capital
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
several
others.
but
now
according
to
the
court
and
its
interpretation,
the
several
states
could
levy
in
numerable
other
taxes
without
having
to
meet
a
complex
set
of
criteria
which
congress
has
enacted
in
the
case
of
section
548.
moreover,
under
section
548
if
you
choose
one
of
the
four
permissible
modes,
you
cannot
tax
on
any
or
the
other
three
ways
that
provides
other
tax
in
either
one
of
the
fours
in
lieu
of
all
the
others.
but
now
again
if
the
court's
interpretation,
the
massachusetts's
court
interpretation
is
--
is
accepted
why
the
states
would
be
free
to
again
impose
many
other
forms
of
state
taxation.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
congressional
reliance.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
statute
goes
on
to
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
and
--
but
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
several
states
may
tax
such
shares
or
the
dividends
or
tax
such
associations
on
in
that
income
or
under
the
four
subdivision,
tax
such
associations
according
to
a
measure
by
the
state
incomes.
the
latter
was
the
1926
amendment
or
the
effect
of
which
was
to
authorize
the
levying
of
the
state
excise
franchised
taxes
on
the
banks.
the
reason
for
that
first
sentence
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
all
of
the
section
548
i
was
talking
about
on
national
bank
shares
is
a
really
historical
vestige.
in
1864,
when
the
original
statute
was
passed
why
it
permitted
only
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares
and
that
first
sentence
says,
“come
down
through
the
century
and
the
amendments
authorizing
the
taxation
of
national
bank
income
and
authorizing
excise
of
franchise
taxes
which
is
added
as
later
sentences.”
but
i
certainly
--
we
strongly
submit
that
section
548
covers
much
more
than
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares.
indeed
it
comprehensibly
controls
the
entire
scope
of
the
national
bank
taxation.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that
is
true
too.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that's
true.
this
court
has
--
has
held
that
where
there
has
been
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decision
to
this
court
that
those
decisions
should
remain
undisturbed.
this
is
precisely
the
case
with
respect
to
section
548.
the
--
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
548
this
court
decided
for
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
osborn
versus
the
bank
of
the
united
states,
prior
to
the
1923
amendment
there
was
owensboro
national
bank
and
the
bank
of
california
and
i
need
not
go
on.
i
think
that
the
parallel
legislative
and
judicial
activity
with
respect
to
this
section
whereas
congress
over
the
course
of
the
years
carefully
defined
another
form
of
state
taxation,
there
were
constantly
decisions
before
under
which
this
court
had
held
without
any
qualification
that
except
for
the
section
548
the
states
could
not
levy
any
taxes.
this
court
should
decide
that
the
--
that
this
congressional
reliance
does
not
preclude
in
reexamination
of
these
decisions
but
as
we
suggest
that
it
should
not.
in
fact
it
is
--
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
situation
where
there's
going
to
be
more
meaningful
dialogue
between
this
court
and
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
i
think
that
in
a
very
real
sense
these
decisions
have
become
an
integral
part
of
section
548.
if,
however,
this
court
should
decide
that
it
will
reexamine
those
decisions,
we
submit
that
a
national
bank
as
a
federal
instrumentality
is
still
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
the
responsibility
of
the
congress
in
the
area
of
banking
and
currency
is
a
very
unique
one
unlike
other
regulatory
areas
such
as
the
antitrust
laws.
the
congress
is
responsible
for
designing
and
creating
the
very
financial
structure
that
the
fiscal
policies
and
affairs
of
this
nation
have
conducted
primary
and
vital
with
the
structure
on
national
banks.
they
are
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
national
banking
system.
as
such,
congress
in
affecting
its
policies
has
resort
to
a
nationwide
uniform
system
of
facts.
it
need
not
rely
and
be
dependent
upon
state
banks
and
the
governments
of
the
several
states.
the
national
banks
moreover
are
the
keystones
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
they
are
the
only
financial
institutions
in
the
country
which
are
required
to
be
members
of
that
system.
it
is
true
that
state
banks,
state
commercial
banks
can
become
members
of
the
system
but
this
in
no
way
that
we
submit
the
tracks
from
the
indispensable
role
of
the
national
banks
in
affecting
national
monetary
and
fiscal
policy.
of
course
national
banks
have
a
proprietary
aspect
but
this
has
always
been
and
still
is
a
fundamental
part
of
the
congressional
scheme.
the
--
perhaps
to
the
matter
is
that
these
federal
instruments
they
are
vital
and
essential
to
affecting
monetary
and
fiscal
policy.
we
submit
that
for
this
reason,
this
court
could
unanimously
say
in
department
of
employment
versus
the
united
states
decided
just
a
little
over
a
year
ago
that
national
banks
were
tax
immune
instrumentalities
and
that
this
status
was
beyond
dispute.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
issues
relating
to
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
court
has
held
at
--
the
congress
has
--
there's
been
a
trend
of
decisions
which
had
indicated
as
the
court
below
has
suggested
that
the
power
for
the
congress
to
immunize
a
federal
instrumentality
is
a
very
broad
one.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
well.
we
submit
that
it
--
well
we
submit
that
in
the
eyes
of
congress
that
congress
clearly
considered
as
a
federal
instrumentality
and
that
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
federal
instrumentality
for
the
purposes
of
this
--
of
a
constitutional
immunity
might
present
this
court
with
a
different
question
than
a
question
of
whether
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
no
which
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
various
vehicles
for
carrying
out
some
of
the
aims
of
the
government
where
they
would
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
--
be
entitled
of
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
would
submit
that
that
does
necessarily
follow.
i
think
it
is
an
easier
question
for
the
court
to
hold
a
federal
instrumental
immune
from
state
taxation
where
congress
has
created
an
immunity.
i
think
it's
a
slightly
closer
question
is
the
question
where
before
this
court
de
novo
of
whether
a
federal
instrumentality
should
be
entitled
to
a
constitutional
immunity.
we
submit
that
the
clear
--
clear
stance
in
this
case
is
under
section
548
where
there
has
been
the
congressional
conference
of
an
immunity.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
because
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
under
the
implied
powers
of
the
national
government
to
create
national
banks
and
a
national
banking
system
as
an
implied
power
of
the
federal
government
implied
from
the
authority
to
levying
collect
taxes
to
develop
and
be
all
means
to
run
the
affairs
of
the
government
why
the
decision
of
mcculloch
versus
maryland
put
to
rest
forever.
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government,
the
congress
could
fashion
a
national
banking
institution.
and
in
fashioning
that
institution
why
--
and
because
this
institution
is
fashioned
under
the
paramount
law
of
the
united
states
--
of
the
federal
government
why
it
is
well
within
the
power
of
congress
to
immunize
that
institution.
this
court
in
turning
to
the
state
sales
tax
issue,
this
court
has
held
at
where
a
sales
tax
is
required
to
be
added
to
sales
price
and
collective
from
a
purchaser
and
that
this
tax
is
a
debt
from
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
purchaser.
this
is
precisely
the
nature
of
the
massachusetts
sales
tax.
subsection
3
cited
right
in
appendix
57
of
the
appellant's
brief
states
that
reimbursement
for
the
tax
here
imposed
shall
be
paid
by
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor
and
each
vendor
in
the
commonwealth
shall
add
to
the
sales
price
and
shall
collect
from
the
purchaser
the
full
amount
of
the
tax
imposed
by
this
section
and
that
such
tax
shall
be
a
debt
from
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor.
as
a
penalty
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
so
add
and
so
collect
the
tax,
its
registration
can
be
suspended
or
revoked
and
it
can
be
force
to
seize
doing
business
in
the
common
law.
tax
moreover
must
be
separately
stated
and
separately
charged.
in
addition,
a
vendor
is
prohibited
from
advertising
that
he
will
absorb
or
assume
it
or
that
he
will
not
add
it
to
the
sales
price.
despite
these
characteristics,
the
court
below
held
that
the
sales
tax
was
a
tax
on
a
retail
merchant.
the
appellee
contends
that
this
question
is
not
before
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
established
that
where
federal
rights
were
involved
such
as
the
appellant's
rights
in
this
appeal,
that
the
characterization
of
state
tax
by
a
state
court
is
not
binding
on
this
court
and
we
think
that
for
this
reason,
this
court
should
find
that
the
sales
tax
is
a
tax
levied
on
the
appellant
as
a
purchaser.
perhaps
the
court
below
relied
very
heavily
on
what
it
assumed
to
be
the
case
that
is
that
there
was
no
penalty
on
a
vendor
on
failing
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
purchaser.
at
the
time
that
the
court
decided
this
case,
there
wasn't
affect
to
massachusetts
a
temporary
sales
and
use
tax.
under
the
temporary
sales
and
use
tax,
the
entire
sales
tax
act
was
entitled
the
section
and
all
of
provisions
relating
to
the
sales
tax
with
designated
subsections.
in
the
general
penalty
provision
relating
to
the
registration
of
vendors
and
the
suspension
on
revocation
of
it,
it
said
that
a
registration
could
be
revoked
or
suspended
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
violate
any
provision
of
this
section.
and
there
was
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
the
reference
to
any
provisions
of
this
section
meant
the
subsection
or
the
section
itself
which
was
the
entire
sales
tax
act
that
any
ambiguity
has
been
resolved.
after
the
decision
by
the
court
below,
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
act
became
permanent
law.
as
part
of
the
permanent
general
laws
of
the
commonwealth,
the
sales
tax
act
is
now
a
chapter.
and
so
the
section
which
deals
with
the
revocation
and
suspension
of
a
vendor's
registration
states
that
a
registration
can
be
suspended
or
revoked
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
any
section
of
this
chapter.
and
so
there
are
no
longer
is
any
ambiguity
and
there
clearly
is
within
the
statute
of
penalty
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
collect
the
tax.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
section
548
prohibits
the
imposition
of
the
massachusetts
sales
and
use
tax
on
purchases
by
the
appellant
for
its
own
use
of
tangible
personal
property.
we
further
submit
that
in
view
of
the
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
squarely
and
without
any
intimation
to
the
contrary
that
national
banks
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
several
states
except
this
congress
permits
should
not
be
reexamined.
we
further
submit
that
national
banks
and
their
role
as
federal
instrumentalities
in
effecting
the
national
and
fiscal
policies
of
this
nation
are
entitled
to
a
constitutional
immunity
from
state
taxation.
we
further
submit
that
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
is
a
tax
on
national
bank
as
a
purchaser
and
that
this
question
is
properly
reviewable
by
this
court.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant,
the
first
agricultural
national
bank
of
berkshire
county
is
a
national
bank
chartered
under
title
12,
the
united
states
code
as
such
just
one
of
19
national
banks
conducting
banking
operations
in
the
commonwealth.
for
over
two
years,
it
has
paid
under
protest,
massachusetts
sales
and
use
taxes
on
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
for
its
own
use.
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
statute
of
the
appellant
request
of
the
appellee,
the
state
tax
commission,
for
a
ruling
or
an
emergency
regulation
that
it
was
exempt
from
these
taxes,
no
such
ruling
was
issued.
however,
emergency
regulation
number
6
was
promulgated
which
stated
that
the
sales
lease
or
rental
of
tangible
personal
property
of
the
national
banks
and
to
federal
savings
and
home
loan
associations
was
subject
to
the
sales
and
use
taxes.
the
appellant
filed
a
fail
for
declaratory
release
seeking
in
substance
that
it
was
exempt
from
these
taxes.
the
case
was
reserved
and
reported
without
decision
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
for
the
issues
which
are
raised
on
this
appeal
were
passed
on
by
that
court.
there
are
five
issues
in
the
case.
two
of
them
relate
to
the
nature
of
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
and
one
of
the
natures
of
that
tax
is
probably
reviewable
by
this
court.
three
of
them
relate
to
the
tax
immune
status
of
the
national
banks.
the
third
--
the
first
is
whether
section
548
of
title
12
prohibits
the
imposition
of
a
sales
and
use
tax
on
purchases
by
the
appellant.
if
this
court
should
decide
that
issue
affirmative
why
then
none
of
the
other
tax
immunity
issues
need
be
reached.
if,
however,
this
court
should
decide
as
the
appellant
submits
it
should
not,
that
section
548
is
a
purely
permissive
statute.
why
then
the
second
immunity
issue
is
raised,
that
is
whether
after
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
at
a
several
states
are
wholly
without
power
to
levy
any
tax
direct
or
indirect
on
national
banks
except
as
congress
permits,
whether
those
decisions
should
be
reexamined.
only
if
this
court
should
decide
that
these
decisions
should
be
sole
reexamined
is
the
pure
constitution
--
constitutional
issue
presented.
that
is
whether
national
banks,
the
federal
instrumentalities
should
continue
to
enjoy
the
constitutional
protection
from
state
taxation,
again,
except
this
congress
permits.
inherent
in
the
nature
of
our
federalism,
is
a
necessity
of
accommodating
the
affairs
of
the
nation
and
the
power
of
the
several
states
to
tax.
congress
is
fashioned
its
accommodation
in
section
548.
section
548
provides
that
the
several
states
can
levy
taxes
on
national
bank
shares,
dividends
there
from
and
on
the
income
of
national
banks
and
taxes
measured
by
a
recording
the
income
of
these
banks
in
addition
to
real
estate
taxes.
section
548
does
not
permit
the
levying
of
a
sales
and
use
tax.
despite
the
language
of
section
548
and
despite
the
overwhelming
authority
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
appellee
now
urges
upon
this
court
that
the
appellant
is
subject
to
state
sales
and
use
taxes.
the
original
predecessor
to
section
548
was
enacted
in
1864,
one
year
after
the
national
banking
system
was
created.
the
debates
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
section
indicate
that
the
congress
was
well
aware
that
it
was
making
a
decision
into
determining
the
sculpt
of
permissible
state
taxation
of
national
banks
which
was
a
purely
legislative
market
and
was
not
one
of
constitutional
dimension.
for
example,
one
of
the
objects
of
the
1864
legislation
was
to
encourage
the
conversion
of
not
state
banks
international
banks.
congress
knew
that
any
types
of
protection
for
the
national
banks
would
encourage
such
conversions.
this
objective
is
of
course
one
of
legislator
policy.
the
congressional
debates
further
indicate
that
the
congress
is
well
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
of
the
constitutional
provision
against
a
tax
on
national
banks.
for
this
reason,
we're
fully
conscious
that
in
setting
forth
the
permissible
mode
of
state
taxation
they
were
determining
the
outer
limits
beyond
which
the
state
could
not
tax.
subsequent
legislative
activity
with
respect
to
section
548
confirms
this.
in
1923,
an
amendment
was
enacted
which
permitted
the
several
states
to
tax
the
dividends
and
the
income
of
national
banks
the
original
predecessor
had
only
permitted
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares
in
real
estate
--
in
the
real
estate
of
the
banks.
in
1926,
the
amendment
was
passed
which
authorized
the
states
to
levy
excise
and
franchise
taxes.
in
1935,
the
congress
subjected
national
banks
to
state
unemployment
taxes.
in
short,
congress
has
always
seen
fit
to
carefully
define
the
precise
scope
of
state
taxation
of
these
banks.
it
has
never
seen
to
authorize
and
subject
the
national
banks
to
general
state
taxation.
in
1950,
the
congress
rejected
a
bill
which
would
have
expressly
authorized
the
taxation
of
the
purchases
of
national
banks
under
state
sales
and
use
taxes.
this
bill
never
became
law.
the
decision
below
is
in
effect
an
attempt
to
resurrect
and
judicially
enact
that
bill.
in
so
doing
the
court
below
relied
on
the
cannon
of
construction
that
tax
immunity
is
not
to
be
granted
by
implication.
but
the
case
has
relied
on
or
in
opposite.
either
they
are
not
cases
of
statutory
construction
or
they
aren't
cases
where
a
statutory
immunity
was
conferred,
a
limited
immunity.
and
the
issue
was
whether
that
immunity
should
be
extended
by
implication.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
a
far
different
matter.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
congress
by
expressly
authorizing
four
casually
defined
methods
of
taxation,
intended
that
other
such
methods
of
taxation
should
be
prohibited.
moreover,
resort
to
that
judicial
kind
of
construction
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
case
starting
–
a
line
of
decisions
starting
with
owensboro
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes,
they
are
square
holdings.
owensboro,
bank
of
california
versus
richardson,
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
des
moines
national
bank
versus
fairweather,
first
national
bank
of
guthrie
center
versus
anderson.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
position
we
take
is
that
this
is
perfectly
clear.
they
have
in
citing
the
statute,
they
have
always
stated
unequivocally
and
--
and
without
any
intimation
to
the
contrary
and
the
over
century
that
this
court
has
construed
this
section
that
except
for
the
permissive
legislation
of
congress,
the
states
are
wholly
without
power
to
levy
a
tax.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
think
that
the
cases
of
--
are
subject
to
both
interpretations
that
the
--
they
can
be
construed
as
holding
one
that
section
548
as
a
legislative
matter,
has
defined
the
scope
beyond
which
states
cannot
tax
national
banks.
i
further
submit
that
they
are
also
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
whether
they
would
be
immune
constitutionally
or
not,
and
this
is
the
first
proposition
upon
which
we
were
relying.
those
cases
i
think
can
also
be
right
standing
for
the
proposition
that
--
where
it
not
so
permissive
legislation
of
congress.
the
national
banks
could
not
be
taxed
because
it
was
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
would
not
like
be
in
a
position
of
having
in
advance
with
that
argument.
our
position
is
that
if
congress
had
authorized
the
state
taxation
of
national
banks,
why
of
that
--
by
means
of
a
sales
and
use
tax
well
that's
actually
perfectly
--
would
be
perfectly
okay.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that's
exactly
right.
and
congress
can
prohibit
the
taxation
of
national
banks
as
it
sees
fit.
the
court,
as
i
mentioned,
relied
on
this
cannon
of
construction
that
immunity
is
not
to
be
extended
by
implication
as
we
suggest
the
cases
are
in
opposite
and
they
do
not
present
a
statute
where
four
carefully
defined
modes
were
permitted.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
this,
by
utilizing
that
cannon
of
construction,
it
would
require
an
expressed
provision
in
section
548.
but
the
requirement
of
an
expressed
provision
in
section
548
is
exactly
what
this
court
in
its
decisions
has
made
superfluous
and
this
approaches
judicial
legislation
in
the
form
of
judicial
construction.
the
analysis
is
somewhat
disturbing.
the
result
is
we
submitted
even
more
so.
now,
under
section
548,
if
a
statement
of
levy
one
of
the
four
permissible
taxes,
why
would
have
to
make
some
very
complicated
criteria
relating
to
whether
it
was
taxing
at
a
rate
higher
than
or
rate
of
money
capital
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
several
others.
but
now
according
to
the
court
and
its
interpretation,
the
several
states
could
levy
in
numerable
other
taxes
without
having
to
meet
a
complex
set
of
criteria
which
congress
has
enacted
in
the
case
of
section
548.
moreover,
under
section
548
if
you
choose
one
of
the
four
permissible
modes,
you
cannot
tax
on
any
or
the
other
three
ways
that
provides
other
tax
in
either
one
of
the
fours
in
lieu
of
all
the
others.
but
now
again
if
the
court's
interpretation,
the
massachusetts's
court
interpretation
is
--
is
accepted
why
the
states
would
be
free
to
again
impose
many
other
forms
of
state
taxation.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
congressional
reliance.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
statute
goes
on
to
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
and
--
but
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
several
states
may
tax
such
shares
or
the
dividends
or
tax
such
associations
on
in
that
income
or
under
the
four
subdivision,
tax
such
associations
according
to
a
measure
by
the
state
incomes.
the
latter
was
the
1926
amendment
or
the
effect
of
which
was
to
authorize
the
levying
of
the
state
excise
franchised
taxes
on
the
banks.
the
reason
for
that
first
sentence
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
all
of
the
section
548
i
was
talking
about
on
national
bank
shares
is
a
really
historical
vestige.
in
1864,
when
the
original
statute
was
passed
why
it
permitted
only
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares
and
that
first
sentence
says,
“come
down
through
the
century
and
the
amendments
authorizing
the
taxation
of
national
bank
income
and
authorizing
excise
of
franchise
taxes
which
is
added
as
later
sentences.”
but
i
certainly
--
we
strongly
submit
that
section
548
covers
much
more
than
the
taxation
of
national
bank
shares.
indeed
it
comprehensibly
controls
the
entire
scope
of
the
national
bank
taxation.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that
is
true
too.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
that's
true.
this
court
has
--
has
held
that
where
there
has
been
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decision
to
this
court
that
those
decisions
should
remain
undisturbed.
this
is
precisely
the
case
with
respect
to
section
548.
the
--
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
548
this
court
decided
for
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
osborn
versus
the
bank
of
the
united
states,
prior
to
the
1923
amendment
there
was
owensboro
national
bank
and
the
bank
of
california
and
i
need
not
go
on.
i
think
that
the
parallel
legislative
and
judicial
activity
with
respect
to
this
section
whereas
congress
over
the
course
of
the
years
carefully
defined
another
form
of
state
taxation,
there
were
constantly
decisions
before
under
which
this
court
had
held
without
any
qualification
that
except
for
the
section
548
the
states
could
not
levy
any
taxes.
this
court
should
decide
that
the
--
that
this
congressional
reliance
does
not
preclude
in
reexamination
of
these
decisions
but
as
we
suggest
that
it
should
not.
in
fact
it
is
--
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
situation
where
there's
going
to
be
more
meaningful
dialogue
between
this
court
and
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
and
i
think
that
in
a
very
real
sense
these
decisions
have
become
an
integral
part
of
section
548.
if,
however,
this
court
should
decide
that
it
will
reexamine
those
decisions,
we
submit
that
a
national
bank
as
a
federal
instrumentality
is
still
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
the
responsibility
of
the
congress
in
the
area
of
banking
and
currency
is
a
very
unique
one
unlike
other
regulatory
areas
such
as
the
antitrust
laws.
the
congress
is
responsible
for
designing
and
creating
the
very
financial
structure
that
the
fiscal
policies
and
affairs
of
this
nation
have
conducted
primary
and
vital
with
the
structure
on
national
banks.
they
are
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
national
banking
system.
as
such,
congress
in
affecting
its
policies
has
resort
to
a
nationwide
uniform
system
of
facts.
it
need
not
rely
and
be
dependent
upon
state
banks
and
the
governments
of
the
several
states.
the
national
banks
moreover
are
the
keystones
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
they
are
the
only
financial
institutions
in
the
country
which
are
required
to
be
members
of
that
system.
it
is
true
that
state
banks,
state
commercial
banks
can
become
members
of
the
system
but
this
in
no
way
that
we
submit
the
tracks
from
the
indispensable
role
of
the
national
banks
in
affecting
national
monetary
and
fiscal
policy.
of
course
national
banks
have
a
proprietary
aspect
but
this
has
always
been
and
still
is
a
fundamental
part
of
the
congressional
scheme.
the
--
perhaps
to
the
matter
is
that
these
federal
instruments
they
are
vital
and
essential
to
affecting
monetary
and
fiscal
policy.
we
submit
that
for
this
reason,
this
court
could
unanimously
say
in
department
of
employment
versus
the
united
states
decided
just
a
little
over
a
year
ago
that
national
banks
were
tax
immune
instrumentalities
and
that
this
status
was
beyond
dispute.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
issues
relating
to
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
the
court
has
held
at
--
the
congress
has
--
there's
been
a
trend
of
decisions
which
had
indicated
as
the
court
below
has
suggested
that
the
power
for
the
congress
to
immunize
a
federal
instrumentality
is
a
very
broad
one.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
well.
we
submit
that
it
--
well
we
submit
that
in
the
eyes
of
congress
that
congress
clearly
considered
as
a
federal
instrumentality
and
that
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
federal
instrumentality
for
the
purposes
of
this
--
of
a
constitutional
immunity
might
present
this
court
with
a
different
question
than
a
question
of
whether
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
no
which
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
various
vehicles
for
carrying
out
some
of
the
aims
of
the
government
where
they
would
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
--
be
entitled
of
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
i
would
submit
that
that
does
necessarily
follow.
i
think
it
is
an
easier
question
for
the
court
to
hold
a
federal
instrumental
immune
from
state
taxation
where
congress
has
created
an
immunity.
i
think
it's
a
slightly
closer
question
is
the
question
where
before
this
court
de
novo
of
whether
a
federal
instrumentality
should
be
entitled
to
a
constitutional
immunity.
we
submit
that
the
clear
--
clear
stance
in
this
case
is
under
section
548
where
there
has
been
the
congressional
conference
of
an
immunity.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
yes.
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
because
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
ronald
h.
kessel
under
the
implied
powers
of
the
national
government
to
create
national
banks
and
a
national
banking
system
as
an
implied
power
of
the
federal
government
implied
from
the
authority
to
levying
collect
taxes
to
develop
and
be
all
means
to
run
the
affairs
of
the
government
why
the
decision
of
mcculloch
versus
maryland
put
to
rest
forever.
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government,
the
congress
could
fashion
a
national
banking
institution.
and
in
fashioning
that
institution
why
--
and
because
this
institution
is
fashioned
under
the
paramount
law
of
the
united
states
--
of
the
federal
government
why
it
is
well
within
the
power
of
congress
to
immunize
that
institution.
this
court
in
turning
to
the
state
sales
tax
issue,
this
court
has
held
at
where
a
sales
tax
is
required
to
be
added
to
sales
price
and
collective
from
a
purchaser
and
that
this
tax
is
a
debt
from
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
purchaser.
this
is
precisely
the
nature
of
the
massachusetts
sales
tax.
subsection
3
cited
right
in
appendix
57
of
the
appellant's
brief
states
that
reimbursement
for
the
tax
here
imposed
shall
be
paid
by
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor
and
each
vendor
in
the
commonwealth
shall
add
to
the
sales
price
and
shall
collect
from
the
purchaser
the
full
amount
of
the
tax
imposed
by
this
section
and
that
such
tax
shall
be
a
debt
from
the
purchaser
to
the
vendor.
as
a
penalty
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
so
add
and
so
collect
the
tax,
its
registration
can
be
suspended
or
revoked
and
it
can
be
force
to
seize
doing
business
in
the
common
law.
tax
moreover
must
be
separately
stated
and
separately
charged.
in
addition,
a
vendor
is
prohibited
from
advertising
that
he
will
absorb
or
assume
it
or
that
he
will
not
add
it
to
the
sales
price.
despite
these
characteristics,
the
court
below
held
that
the
sales
tax
was
a
tax
on
a
retail
merchant.
the
appellee
contends
that
this
question
is
not
before
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
established
that
where
federal
rights
were
involved
such
as
the
appellant's
rights
in
this
appeal,
that
the
characterization
of
state
tax
by
a
state
court
is
not
binding
on
this
court
and
we
think
that
for
this
reason,
this
court
should
find
that
the
sales
tax
is
a
tax
levied
on
the
appellant
as
a
purchaser.
perhaps
the
court
below
relied
very
heavily
on
what
it
assumed
to
be
the
case
that
is
that
there
was
no
penalty
on
a
vendor
on
failing
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
purchaser.
at
the
time
that
the
court
decided
this
case,
there
wasn't
affect
to
massachusetts
a
temporary
sales
and
use
tax.
under
the
temporary
sales
and
use
tax,
the
entire
sales
tax
act
was
entitled
the
section
and
all
of
provisions
relating
to
the
sales
tax
with
designated
subsections.
in
the
general
penalty
provision
relating
to
the
registration
of
vendors
and
the
suspension
on
revocation
of
it,
it
said
that
a
registration
could
be
revoked
or
suspended
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
violate
any
provision
of
this
section.
and
there
was
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
the
reference
to
any
provisions
of
this
section
meant
the
subsection
or
the
section
itself
which
was
the
entire
sales
tax
act
that
any
ambiguity
has
been
resolved.
after
the
decision
by
the
court
below,
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
act
became
permanent
law.
as
part
of
the
permanent
general
laws
of
the
commonwealth,
the
sales
tax
act
is
now
a
chapter.
and
so
the
section
which
deals
with
the
revocation
and
suspension
of
a
vendor's
registration
states
that
a
registration
can
be
suspended
or
revoked
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
any
section
of
this
chapter.
and
so
there
are
no
longer
is
any
ambiguity
and
there
clearly
is
within
the
statute
of
penalty
for
a
vendor's
failure
to
collect
the
tax.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
section
548
prohibits
the
imposition
of
the
massachusetts
sales
and
use
tax
on
purchases
by
the
appellant
for
its
own
use
of
tangible
personal
property.
we
further
submit
that
in
view
of
the
long
standing
congressional
reliance
and
acceptance
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
squarely
and
without
any
intimation
to
the
contrary
that
national
banks
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
several
states
except
this
congress
permits
should
not
be
reexamined.
we
further
submit
that
national
banks
and
their
role
as
federal
instrumentalities
in
effecting
the
national
and
fiscal
policies
of
this
nation
are
entitled
to
a
constitutional
immunity
from
state
taxation.
we
further
submit
that
the
massachusetts
sales
tax
is
a
tax
on
national
bank
as
a
purchaser
and
that
this
question
is
properly
reviewable
by
this
court.
