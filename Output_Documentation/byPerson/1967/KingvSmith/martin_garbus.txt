mr.
martin
garbus
may
it
please
the
court.
the
history
of
the
regulation
indicates
that
its
sole
function
was
not
to
save
money
but
to
restrict
case
loads,
to
act
cumulatively
against
certain
families.
at
page
710
of
the
appendix
as
set
forth
in
the
minutes
of
the
board
in
alabama
when
they
passed
this
particular
regulation,
and
commissioner
king
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas
was
asked
at
the
trial.
“mr.
king,
are
you
aware
of
any
legal
machinery
which
can
make
it
mandatory
to
such
so
called
substitute
parents
carry
on
the
responsibility
of
supporting
the
child?”
he
answered,
no.
the
next
question,
“do
you
know
of
any
one
case
whereas
the
result
of
the
application
of
the
substitute
parent
rule,
the
alleged
father
or
parent
has
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
children?”
the
answer
was
no.
and
when
alabama
some
23,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid.
in
georgia
some
23,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid.
and
in
louisiana,
some
10,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid
for
the
same
regulation.
according
to
hew,
there
are
nearly
one
half
a
million
children
in
the
country
at
the
present
time
being
denied
aid
because
of
this
regulation.
mr.
martin
garbus
18
states
have
this
regulation
or
similar
regulations
and
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
mr.
martin
garbus
throughout
the
country,
there
are
adc
programs
and
adcu
programs.
i
think
some
18
and
19
states
have
adopted
the
program
whereby
they
give
aid
even
though
the
man
is
in
the
house
even
though
the
married
spouse
is
living
there.
it's
a
regulation
that
was
passed
on
a
test
basis
in
1961,
was
that
thereafter
an
experimental
regulation
is
presently
in
effect.
the
states
have
the
option
with
respect
to
whether
they
want
to
adopt
it
or
not.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
but
the
thrust
of-—
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
i'd
like
to
add
supplemental
to
the
court,
give
you
the
list
of
those
states
and
i
will
also
furnish
you
with
the
regulations.
the
other
analogy
that
mrs.
stapp
makes,
that
if
the
substitute
father
marries
the
man,
in
other
words,
it
encourages
immorality,
if
the
substitute
father
marries
the
man,
then
it's
not
that
his
interest,
in
other
words
to
marry
them
because
aid
will
be
lost.
that's
not
the
way
that
federal
regulation
is
written.
the
federal
law
provides
that
if
the
man
does
marry
the
woman,
and
if
the
man
is
the
step
parent,
he's
still
not
legally
responsible
for
the
child,
and
aid
should
go
to
that
as
family.
now
what
alabama
has
done,
it
compounded
the
substitute
parent
law,
with
the
provision
that
the
step
parent
doesn't
--
the
presence
of
the
step
parent
cuts
off
the
children
from
aid.
and
therefore
that
family
has
denied
aid.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
handbook
transmittal
which
is
the
federal
interpretation
of
those
regulations
is
very
clear
and
specific
in
the
sense,
that
aid
should
be
given
even
though
the
man
and
the
woman
marry
--
mr.
martin
garbus
right,
or
as
long
as
he's
not
the
natural
father—
mr.
martin
garbus
it
should
be
disapproved
and
that
is
the
interim
regulation
which
alabama
has
passed
in
this
case,
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case,
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case.
and
if
this
court
narrowly
interprets
this
case
just
to
strike
down
the
classification
based
on
sexual
morality,
rather
than
the
classification
based
on
support,
alabama
and
all
the
other
states
will
then
pass
other
regulations
unrelated
to
the
question
of
support.
for
example,
they
will
deny
aid
to
a
child
if
the
father
funded
the
child.
where
if
the
man
in
the
house
funded
the
child
or
if
the
man
in
the
house
takes
the
child
to
church,
or
if
the
man
in
the
house
indicates
any
kind
of
interest
in
the
child,
the
basic
issue
is
placed
by
mr.
justice
fortas
is
the
question
of
support.
and
the
only
grant
for
the
denying
a
child
aid
is
when
that
man
is
legally
obligated
to
support
them
is
removed
from
the
house.
mr.
martin
garbus
hew
has
passed
on
the
alabama
plan.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
disapproved
the
plan.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
hew
in
december
11th
of
1964
sent
back
the
last
alabama
(voice
overlap),
in
other
words
alabama
wrote
and
said,
“here's
our
plan
hew
be
applied
to
it
in
a
serious
negotiation
of
conversations
and
said,
and
it
set
forth
in
the
decision
that
the
alabama
plan
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
fleming
ruling,
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
constitution,
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
social
security
act.
then
alabama
was
asked
again
to
negotiate,
to
send
another
submission,
and
alabama
never
did.
now
under
section
602
of
the
social
security
act,
the
only
remedy
that
hew
has,
is
to
disapprove
an
entire
plan.
in
other
words
hew
was
so
upset
about
the
plan,
they
would
stop
any
aid
going
to
any
children
in
alabama.
the
drastic
measure
which
hew
has
to
take
if
they
want
to
enforce
something
results
in
hew
being
handcuffed.
mr.
martin
garbus
we
say
that,
we
also
say
that—
mr.
martin
garbus
what
i
am
concerned
about
in
a
sense
is
the
feeling
that
in
georgia
and
in
louisiana,
those
plans
have
been
disapproved.
and
i
can
see
the
argument
being
made
that
if
they
were
that
inconsistent,
they
should
have
been
approved.
i
don't
think
one
has
to
go
further
than
that.
i
think
the
statutory
holding
in
this
case
will
affect
the
18
other
states
that
we're
talking
about,
i
think
a
definition
from
this
court—
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
should
be,
if
i
may
say
the
decision
of
this
court—
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
the
reading
of
the
statute,
and
that
would
cut
against
the
substitute
kind
of
regulation
that
alabama
has
passed.
it
was
litigated
below.
it
will
cut
against
the
alabama
substitute
parent
regulation
that
is
the
interim
regulation.
and
it
will
cut
against
the
substitute
parent
regulations
against
the
other
states.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
you
have
in
this
instance
and
this
is
the
first
case
before
you
like
this,
the
relationship
between
hew
and
the
states
that
administer
aid.
and
you
have
specific
authority
in
hew
to
approve
proper
state
plans.
and
i
suppose
one
of
the
significances
of
the
fleming
ruling
was
it
again
reasserted
the
right
of
hew
to
pass
on
state
plans.
and
of
course,
the
fleming
rule
by
implication
then
became
more
of
a
statute
in
section
604.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
step
for
the
support,
the
federal
handbook
exception
at
section
3412
subdivision
4
states
as
follows,
“in
the
absence
of
a
legal
obligation
to
assume
a
parental
role,
a
step
parent
is
no
more
of
a
parent
than
any
other
person
acting
on
local
apprentice.
in
these
situations,
the
only
safeguard
to
the
child's
right
to
assistance
is
its
eligibility
under
the
condition
of
being
deprived
of
the
support
or
care
of
the
natural
parent.”
now
the
other
parent
spoken
of
in
section
3412
are
all
natural
parents,
whether
married
or
not.
in
other
words,
in
alabama
if
the
man
forced
as
an
illegitimate
child,
he
still
can
be
compelled
to
support
that
child
so
long
as
he's
the
father.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
definition
would
be
that
states
must
treat
his
parents
for
the
purposes
of
adc
eligibility
only
persons
with
a
legal
obligation
to
provide
support
and
that's
the
purpose
of
hew.
mr.
martin
garbus
oh,
yes.
the
reading
of
the
statutory
history
in
this
case
justifies
that
interpretation.
the
word
parent
is
used
several
times
in
the
statute
itself
and
an
analysis
of
how
it's
used
in
the
statute
leaves
no
doubt
but
then
they're
talking
about
the
natural
parent.
under
section
602,
a
state
plan
must
have
a
provision
which
“provides
a
prompt
notice
to
appropriate
law
enforcement
officials
of
the
furnishing
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
in
respect
of
the
child
who
has
been
deserted
or
abandoned
by
a
parent.
now
the
function
of
that
notice
provision
to
law
enforcement
officials
is
so
that
they
can
go
out
and
compel
support.
now
under
alabama
law,
and
under
the
law
of
most
of
the
states
in
this
country,
you
can't
compel
support
from
anyone
other
than
a
natural
parent
or
one
who
has
adopted
the
child.
now
hew
then
in
its
handbook,
in
transmittal
which
again
is
the
official
regulation
concerning
what
is
a
parent,
directs
states
to
give
notice
regarding
only
those
persons
who
under
state
laws
are
defined
as
parents
for
the
support
of
minor
children.
alabama's
own
welfare
regulation
states
with
respect
to
that
notice
provision,
report
parents
who
are
legally
responsible
under
alabama
law.
these
are
the
natural
or
adoptive
parents
of
a
child.
a
natural
parent
includes
the
father
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
if
paternity
has
been
legally
established.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
stepparent.
so
the
provision
--
this
attempted
analogy
that
mrs.
stapp
was
trying
to
make
about
an
inconsistency,
it's
because
the
facts
that
she's
talking
about
inconsistent
with
alabama
law
itself.
mr.
martin
garbus
i'm
sorry
the
section
-
no,
i
find
that
consistent,
i'm
sorry.
i
find
that
consistent.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
mean
if
that's
inconsistent
well
what
mrs.
stapp
was
saying,
with
respect
to
how
you
should
--
mr.
martin
garbus
that
would
be
section
606
which
defines--
mr.
martin
garbus
it
is
set
forth
that
at
page
45
of
the
appendix.
mr.
martin
garbus
45
of
the
appendix
and
it's
in
the
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes
it
is.
in
alabama
it's
about
80%.
well
first
of
all,
the
alabama
statute
which
relates
to
the
federal
statute
requires
alabama
to
furnish
aid
to
needy
dependent
children
as
defined
in
the
federal
act.
that's
the
alabama
enabling
act.
so
alabama
in
passing
that
particular
piece
of
legislation
has
decided
to
be
bound
by
how
the
federal
government
defines
dependent
child,
as
have
all
the
other
states.
now
with
respect
to
hew,
beside
in
the
sense,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
have
the
statute
which
specifically
states
that
the
state
acts
as
the
agent
for
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
dispersing
of
these
funds.
you
also
have
under
section
602,
the
obligations
and
the
powers
that
are
placed
upon
hew
in
dealing
with
the
states.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
greater
power
that
hew
has
in
dealing
with
respect
to
the
creation
of
welfare
programs.
and
one
finds
in
many
other
areas
because
of
the
history
that
existing
project
on
the
social
security
act
came
into
existence.
now
court
below,
when
i
think
a
good
deal
further
than
mrs.
stapp
indicated
they
did
go.
first
of
all,
they
call
the
right
is
involved
here
a
statutory
entitlement.
they
called
it
in
other
words,
a
right
to
receive
eligible
assistance.
and
secretary
fleming
when
he
promulgated
to
set
the
fleming
rule
which
is
set
forth
at
page
19
of
the
brief,
talks
about
the
right
where
the
funds
to
“provide
the
basic
essentials
of
life
itself”.
now
if
the
court
does
get
involved
in
an
equal
protection
argument,
and
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
determine
which
standard
one
is
going
to
use,
then
i
submit
that
the
standard
that
should
be
used
in
this
case
is
one
of
strict
scrutiny.
that
the
right
involved
the
right
to
eligible
assistance,
the
right
to
life,
the
right
to
shelter,
the
right
to
food,
the
right
to
clothing,
is
the
kind
of
a
right
that
the
man
in
this
court
to
closely
and
carefully
analyze
the
kind
of
regulations
that
are
being
passed
against
them.
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
group
that's
involved
in
this
case,
the
most
helpless,
the
impoverished,
and
the
destitute.
those
people
who
are
unable,
these
needy
children
unable
to
come
into
court
and
clarify
the
kinds
of
regulations
that
we're
faced
here
with
today.
i
think
that
the
lower
court
was
proper,
in
it's
decision
every
respect,
i
think
the
implications
of
the
fleming
rule
will
namely
with
respect
to
what
is
the
function
of
these
adc
program,
what
is
impermissible,
an
impermissible
attempt
under
the
federal
program
namely
in
the
fleming
ruling
to
control
illegitimacy
suitable
homes.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
would
think
that
it's
something
other
than
a
supremacy
clause
because
of
the
existence--
because
of
the
power
in
hew
to
regulate
the
agency
which
it's
specifically
set
forth.
i
would
think
though
that
this
case
could
be
decided
on
the
grounds
that
the
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
a
social
security
act,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
alabama
regulation.
mr.
martin
garbus
no,
all
that
hew
can
expect
of
alabama
is
that
it
makes
reasonable
classifications
with
respect--
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
and
to
approve
state
plans,
which
then
release
funds.
its
power
only
is
tied
into
the
funding
question.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
right.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
oh,
it
authorizes
the
state.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
do,
yes.
and
that's
why
the
argument
below--
and
that's
why
the
court
below
sort
of
treated
the
issues
together.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
also
talked
about
the
relationship
between
the
statutes,
and
they
also
talked
about
the
state
plan
and
the
obligation
that
it
puts
on
hew,
and
on
the
federal
government.
and
they
also
relied
in
great
length,
on
the
fleming
ruling
both
again,
for
its
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
what's
proper,
what's
not
proper.
there
are
just
two
final
points
i'd
like
to
make
to
make.
mr.
martin
garbus
in
defining,
as
a
dependent,
in
defining,
as
a
parent,
which
is
the
language
of
section
606,
the
man
who
has
been
described
as
a
substitute
father,
someone
who
has
no
obligation
to
support
them,
and
he
never
had
seen
the
child,
has
not
fathered
any
of
the
child,
does
not
have
custody,
has
no
relationship
to
the
children
at
all,
nonetheless
they
lose
aid
because
of
it.
mr.
martin
garbus
no,
that
definition
is
not
in
606,
right?
mr.
martin
garbus
no.
the
definition
i'm
concerned
with
what
is
the
word
“deprivation
of
a
parent”
mean,
and
parent,
what
i
have
suggested
is,
that
you
look
to
the
hew
transmittals
that
you
look
to
the
legislative
actual
language.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
manner
in
which
hew
has
interpreted
the
word
“parent”.
pardon
me,
the
manner
in
which
alabama
has
interpreted
the
word
“parent”.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
it
sets
forth
in
section
601,
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
sole
purposes
of
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program,
but
to
furnish
assistance
to
needy
dependent
children.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
by
adopting
this
interpretation
of
the
word
“parent”,
alabama
is
acting
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
section
601.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
martin
garbus
surely.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
right.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
should
not
to
be
consistent
with
hew.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
have
just
passed
another
regulation
which
says
they
will
lose
their
rights
in
that
situation.
that's
the
interim
regulation
which
they
passed
after
we
were
successful
in
striking
down
the
first.
and
i
would
submit
that
that--
mr.
martin
garbus
if
she
marries
the
man,
under
alabama
law--
under--
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
now,
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
how
this
saves
funds,
if
you
have
a
case
load
of
150,000
people,
and
you're
interested
in
saving
funds,
there's
a
reasonable
way
to
do
it.
you
just
allocate
your
funds
among
the
most
needy.
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
that
sole
justification
for
regulation
that
it
saves
funds
in
this
case,
would
be
impermissible.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
garbus
may
it
please
the
court.
the
history
of
the
regulation
indicates
that
its
sole
function
was
not
to
save
money
but
to
restrict
case
loads,
to
act
cumulatively
against
certain
families.
at
page
710
of
the
appendix
as
set
forth
in
the
minutes
of
the
board
in
alabama
when
they
passed
this
particular
regulation,
and
commissioner
king
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas
was
asked
at
the
trial.
“mr.
king,
are
you
aware
of
any
legal
machinery
which
can
make
it
mandatory
to
such
so
called
substitute
parents
carry
on
the
responsibility
of
supporting
the
child?”
he
answered,
no.
the
next
question,
“do
you
know
of
any
one
case
whereas
the
result
of
the
application
of
the
substitute
parent
rule,
the
alleged
father
or
parent
has
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
children?”
the
answer
was
no.
and
when
alabama
some
23,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid.
in
georgia
some
23,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid.
and
in
louisiana,
some
10,000
people
were
cut
off
from
aid
for
the
same
regulation.
according
to
hew,
there
are
nearly
one
half
a
million
children
in
the
country
at
the
present
time
being
denied
aid
because
of
this
regulation.
mr.
martin
garbus
18
states
have
this
regulation
or
similar
regulations
and
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
mr.
martin
garbus
throughout
the
country,
there
are
adc
programs
and
adcu
programs.
i
think
some
18
and
19
states
have
adopted
the
program
whereby
they
give
aid
even
though
the
man
is
in
the
house
even
though
the
married
spouse
is
living
there.
it's
a
regulation
that
was
passed
on
a
test
basis
in
1961,
was
that
thereafter
an
experimental
regulation
is
presently
in
effect.
the
states
have
the
option
with
respect
to
whether
they
want
to
adopt
it
or
not.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
but
the
thrust
of-—
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
i'd
like
to
add
supplemental
to
the
court,
give
you
the
list
of
those
states
and
i
will
also
furnish
you
with
the
regulations.
the
other
analogy
that
mrs.
stapp
makes,
that
if
the
substitute
father
marries
the
man,
in
other
words,
it
encourages
immorality,
if
the
substitute
father
marries
the
man,
then
it's
not
that
his
interest,
in
other
words
to
marry
them
because
aid
will
be
lost.
that's
not
the
way
that
federal
regulation
is
written.
the
federal
law
provides
that
if
the
man
does
marry
the
woman,
and
if
the
man
is
the
step
parent,
he's
still
not
legally
responsible
for
the
child,
and
aid
should
go
to
that
as
family.
now
what
alabama
has
done,
it
compounded
the
substitute
parent
law,
with
the
provision
that
the
step
parent
doesn't
--
the
presence
of
the
step
parent
cuts
off
the
children
from
aid.
and
therefore
that
family
has
denied
aid.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
handbook
transmittal
which
is
the
federal
interpretation
of
those
regulations
is
very
clear
and
specific
in
the
sense,
that
aid
should
be
given
even
though
the
man
and
the
woman
marry
--
mr.
martin
garbus
right,
or
as
long
as
he's
not
the
natural
father—
mr.
martin
garbus
it
should
be
disapproved
and
that
is
the
interim
regulation
which
alabama
has
passed
in
this
case,
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case,
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case.
and
if
this
court
narrowly
interprets
this
case
just
to
strike
down
the
classification
based
on
sexual
morality,
rather
than
the
classification
based
on
support,
alabama
and
all
the
other
states
will
then
pass
other
regulations
unrelated
to
the
question
of
support.
for
example,
they
will
deny
aid
to
a
child
if
the
father
funded
the
child.
where
if
the
man
in
the
house
funded
the
child
or
if
the
man
in
the
house
takes
the
child
to
church,
or
if
the
man
in
the
house
indicates
any
kind
of
interest
in
the
child,
the
basic
issue
is
placed
by
mr.
justice
fortas
is
the
question
of
support.
and
the
only
grant
for
the
denying
a
child
aid
is
when
that
man
is
legally
obligated
to
support
them
is
removed
from
the
house.
mr.
martin
garbus
hew
has
passed
on
the
alabama
plan.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
disapproved
the
plan.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
hew
in
december
11th
of
1964
sent
back
the
last
alabama
(voice
overlap),
in
other
words
alabama
wrote
and
said,
“here's
our
plan
hew
be
applied
to
it
in
a
serious
negotiation
of
conversations
and
said,
and
it
set
forth
in
the
decision
that
the
alabama
plan
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
fleming
ruling,
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
constitution,
is
out
of
conformity
with
the
social
security
act.
then
alabama
was
asked
again
to
negotiate,
to
send
another
submission,
and
alabama
never
did.
now
under
section
602
of
the
social
security
act,
the
only
remedy
that
hew
has,
is
to
disapprove
an
entire
plan.
in
other
words
hew
was
so
upset
about
the
plan,
they
would
stop
any
aid
going
to
any
children
in
alabama.
the
drastic
measure
which
hew
has
to
take
if
they
want
to
enforce
something
results
in
hew
being
handcuffed.
mr.
martin
garbus
we
say
that,
we
also
say
that—
mr.
martin
garbus
what
i
am
concerned
about
in
a
sense
is
the
feeling
that
in
georgia
and
in
louisiana,
those
plans
have
been
disapproved.
and
i
can
see
the
argument
being
made
that
if
they
were
that
inconsistent,
they
should
have
been
approved.
i
don't
think
one
has
to
go
further
than
that.
i
think
the
statutory
holding
in
this
case
will
affect
the
18
other
states
that
we're
talking
about,
i
think
a
definition
from
this
court—
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
should
be,
if
i
may
say
the
decision
of
this
court—
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
the
reading
of
the
statute,
and
that
would
cut
against
the
substitute
kind
of
regulation
that
alabama
has
passed.
it
was
litigated
below.
it
will
cut
against
the
alabama
substitute
parent
regulation
that
is
the
interim
regulation.
and
it
will
cut
against
the
substitute
parent
regulations
against
the
other
states.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
you
have
in
this
instance
and
this
is
the
first
case
before
you
like
this,
the
relationship
between
hew
and
the
states
that
administer
aid.
and
you
have
specific
authority
in
hew
to
approve
proper
state
plans.
and
i
suppose
one
of
the
significances
of
the
fleming
ruling
was
it
again
reasserted
the
right
of
hew
to
pass
on
state
plans.
and
of
course,
the
fleming
rule
by
implication
then
became
more
of
a
statute
in
section
604.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
step
for
the
support,
the
federal
handbook
exception
at
section
3412
subdivision
4
states
as
follows,
“in
the
absence
of
a
legal
obligation
to
assume
a
parental
role,
a
step
parent
is
no
more
of
a
parent
than
any
other
person
acting
on
local
apprentice.
in
these
situations,
the
only
safeguard
to
the
child's
right
to
assistance
is
its
eligibility
under
the
condition
of
being
deprived
of
the
support
or
care
of
the
natural
parent.”
now
the
other
parent
spoken
of
in
section
3412
are
all
natural
parents,
whether
married
or
not.
in
other
words,
in
alabama
if
the
man
forced
as
an
illegitimate
child,
he
still
can
be
compelled
to
support
that
child
so
long
as
he's
the
father.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
definition
would
be
that
states
must
treat
his
parents
for
the
purposes
of
adc
eligibility
only
persons
with
a
legal
obligation
to
provide
support
and
that's
the
purpose
of
hew.
mr.
martin
garbus
oh,
yes.
the
reading
of
the
statutory
history
in
this
case
justifies
that
interpretation.
the
word
parent
is
used
several
times
in
the
statute
itself
and
an
analysis
of
how
it's
used
in
the
statute
leaves
no
doubt
but
then
they're
talking
about
the
natural
parent.
under
section
602,
a
state
plan
must
have
a
provision
which
“provides
a
prompt
notice
to
appropriate
law
enforcement
officials
of
the
furnishing
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
in
respect
of
the
child
who
has
been
deserted
or
abandoned
by
a
parent.
now
the
function
of
that
notice
provision
to
law
enforcement
officials
is
so
that
they
can
go
out
and
compel
support.
now
under
alabama
law,
and
under
the
law
of
most
of
the
states
in
this
country,
you
can't
compel
support
from
anyone
other
than
a
natural
parent
or
one
who
has
adopted
the
child.
now
hew
then
in
its
handbook,
in
transmittal
which
again
is
the
official
regulation
concerning
what
is
a
parent,
directs
states
to
give
notice
regarding
only
those
persons
who
under
state
laws
are
defined
as
parents
for
the
support
of
minor
children.
alabama's
own
welfare
regulation
states
with
respect
to
that
notice
provision,
report
parents
who
are
legally
responsible
under
alabama
law.
these
are
the
natural
or
adoptive
parents
of
a
child.
a
natural
parent
includes
the
father
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
if
paternity
has
been
legally
established.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
stepparent.
so
the
provision
--
this
attempted
analogy
that
mrs.
stapp
was
trying
to
make
about
an
inconsistency,
it's
because
the
facts
that
she's
talking
about
inconsistent
with
alabama
law
itself.
mr.
martin
garbus
i'm
sorry
the
section
-
no,
i
find
that
consistent,
i'm
sorry.
i
find
that
consistent.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
mean
if
that's
inconsistent
well
what
mrs.
stapp
was
saying,
with
respect
to
how
you
should
--
mr.
martin
garbus
that
would
be
section
606
which
defines--
mr.
martin
garbus
it
is
set
forth
that
at
page
45
of
the
appendix.
mr.
martin
garbus
45
of
the
appendix
and
it's
in
the
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes
it
is.
in
alabama
it's
about
80%.
well
first
of
all,
the
alabama
statute
which
relates
to
the
federal
statute
requires
alabama
to
furnish
aid
to
needy
dependent
children
as
defined
in
the
federal
act.
that's
the
alabama
enabling
act.
so
alabama
in
passing
that
particular
piece
of
legislation
has
decided
to
be
bound
by
how
the
federal
government
defines
dependent
child,
as
have
all
the
other
states.
now
with
respect
to
hew,
beside
in
the
sense,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
have
the
statute
which
specifically
states
that
the
state
acts
as
the
agent
for
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
dispersing
of
these
funds.
you
also
have
under
section
602,
the
obligations
and
the
powers
that
are
placed
upon
hew
in
dealing
with
the
states.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
greater
power
that
hew
has
in
dealing
with
respect
to
the
creation
of
welfare
programs.
and
one
finds
in
many
other
areas
because
of
the
history
that
existing
project
on
the
social
security
act
came
into
existence.
now
court
below,
when
i
think
a
good
deal
further
than
mrs.
stapp
indicated
they
did
go.
first
of
all,
they
call
the
right
is
involved
here
a
statutory
entitlement.
they
called
it
in
other
words,
a
right
to
receive
eligible
assistance.
and
secretary
fleming
when
he
promulgated
to
set
the
fleming
rule
which
is
set
forth
at
page
19
of
the
brief,
talks
about
the
right
where
the
funds
to
“provide
the
basic
essentials
of
life
itself”.
now
if
the
court
does
get
involved
in
an
equal
protection
argument,
and
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
determine
which
standard
one
is
going
to
use,
then
i
submit
that
the
standard
that
should
be
used
in
this
case
is
one
of
strict
scrutiny.
that
the
right
involved
the
right
to
eligible
assistance,
the
right
to
life,
the
right
to
shelter,
the
right
to
food,
the
right
to
clothing,
is
the
kind
of
a
right
that
the
man
in
this
court
to
closely
and
carefully
analyze
the
kind
of
regulations
that
are
being
passed
against
them.
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
group
that's
involved
in
this
case,
the
most
helpless,
the
impoverished,
and
the
destitute.
those
people
who
are
unable,
these
needy
children
unable
to
come
into
court
and
clarify
the
kinds
of
regulations
that
we're
faced
here
with
today.
i
think
that
the
lower
court
was
proper,
in
it's
decision
every
respect,
i
think
the
implications
of
the
fleming
rule
will
namely
with
respect
to
what
is
the
function
of
these
adc
program,
what
is
impermissible,
an
impermissible
attempt
under
the
federal
program
namely
in
the
fleming
ruling
to
control
illegitimacy
suitable
homes.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
would
think
that
it's
something
other
than
a
supremacy
clause
because
of
the
existence--
because
of
the
power
in
hew
to
regulate
the
agency
which
it's
specifically
set
forth.
i
would
think
though
that
this
case
could
be
decided
on
the
grounds
that
the
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
a
social
security
act,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
alabama
regulation.
mr.
martin
garbus
no,
all
that
hew
can
expect
of
alabama
is
that
it
makes
reasonable
classifications
with
respect--
mr.
martin
garbus
yes,
and
to
approve
state
plans,
which
then
release
funds.
its
power
only
is
tied
into
the
funding
question.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
right.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
oh,
it
authorizes
the
state.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
i
do,
yes.
and
that's
why
the
argument
below--
and
that's
why
the
court
below
sort
of
treated
the
issues
together.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
also
talked
about
the
relationship
between
the
statutes,
and
they
also
talked
about
the
state
plan
and
the
obligation
that
it
puts
on
hew,
and
on
the
federal
government.
and
they
also
relied
in
great
length,
on
the
fleming
ruling
both
again,
for
its
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
what's
proper,
what's
not
proper.
there
are
just
two
final
points
i'd
like
to
make
to
make.
mr.
martin
garbus
in
defining,
as
a
dependent,
in
defining,
as
a
parent,
which
is
the
language
of
section
606,
the
man
who
has
been
described
as
a
substitute
father,
someone
who
has
no
obligation
to
support
them,
and
he
never
had
seen
the
child,
has
not
fathered
any
of
the
child,
does
not
have
custody,
has
no
relationship
to
the
children
at
all,
nonetheless
they
lose
aid
because
of
it.
mr.
martin
garbus
no,
that
definition
is
not
in
606,
right?
mr.
martin
garbus
no.
the
definition
i'm
concerned
with
what
is
the
word
“deprivation
of
a
parent”
mean,
and
parent,
what
i
have
suggested
is,
that
you
look
to
the
hew
transmittals
that
you
look
to
the
legislative
actual
language.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
manner
in
which
hew
has
interpreted
the
word
“parent”.
pardon
me,
the
manner
in
which
alabama
has
interpreted
the
word
“parent”.
mr.
martin
garbus
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
it
sets
forth
in
section
601,
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
sole
purposes
of
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program,
but
to
furnish
assistance
to
needy
dependent
children.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
by
adopting
this
interpretation
of
the
word
“parent”,
alabama
is
acting
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
section
601.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
martin
garbus
surely.
mr.
martin
garbus
that's
right.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
should
not
to
be
consistent
with
hew.
mr.
martin
garbus
they
have
just
passed
another
regulation
which
says
they
will
lose
their
rights
in
that
situation.
that's
the
interim
regulation
which
they
passed
after
we
were
successful
in
striking
down
the
first.
and
i
would
submit
that
that--
mr.
martin
garbus
if
she
marries
the
man,
under
alabama
law--
under--
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
mr.
martin
garbus
yes.
now,
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
how
this
saves
funds,
if
you
have
a
case
load
of
150,000
people,
and
you're
interested
in
saving
funds,
there's
a
reasonable
way
to
do
it.
you
just
allocate
your
funds
among
the
most
needy.
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
that
sole
justification
for
regulation
that
it
saves
funds
in
this
case,
would
be
impermissible.
thank
you.
