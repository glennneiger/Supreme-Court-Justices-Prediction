john
m.
harlan
before
you
do
that,
will
you
tell
me
just
as
precisely
as
you
can,
in
respect
in
what
you
think
the
alabama
program
violates
section
606
if
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
your
position
then
is
that,
the
state
welfare
agents
say
would
have
no
authority
to
talk
to
a
definition
of
a
parent,
because
that
is
defined
in
606?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
did
not
say
it
was
in
606.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
of
course,
the
actual
language
is
--
i
want
you
to
ask
me,
if
you
will,
to
tell
me
again
precisely,
in
what
provision
of
the
federal
statute
do
you
think
is
violated
by
the
alabama
plan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
what
provision
of
the
statute
does
that
conflict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
volume
of
that
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not
just
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
give
it
to
me?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
pleasure.
