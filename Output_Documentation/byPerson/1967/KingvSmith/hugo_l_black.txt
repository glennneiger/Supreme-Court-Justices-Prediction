we
can

do
i
understand

if
the

of
four
children
has
occasional
illicit
relations
with
a

not
the
father
of
those

under

and
that
there
is
no
obligation
at
all
on
the
man
who
is
called

that's
correct,
isn't

understand

marries

becomes
a
stepfather
of
these

is
not

is
it
true
that
if
a
woman
has
informal
relations,
as
you
call
them,
with
a
man,
that
her
children
lose
their
standing
under

that's
right

they're
otherwise
qualified.

well,

not
talk

a

has
been
deserted
by
her
husband.
she
has
four
children.
she
has
what
you
call
“informal

with
another
