mrs.
stapp,
the
money
is
for
the
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
under
the
sun
that
this
child
can
do
in
order
to
qualify
for
this
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
nothing
that
child
can
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i'm
saying
is
the
child’s
mother
who
is
living
alone.
and
that
child
gets
aid
because
the
child
needs
milk.
and
next
door,
there
is
another
child
with
another
mother,
but
that
child’s
mother
is
running
around
with
the
man
so
you’re
discriminating
those
two
children.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
can’t
see
why
the
child
is
denied
milk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
what
her
mother
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
read
correctly
that
in
one
of
these
cases,
this
parent
was
lawfully
wedded
to
another
woman,
and
had
some
children?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
how
can
it
be
two
parents
at
the
same
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
didn't
say
you
would
call
him
a
parent.
