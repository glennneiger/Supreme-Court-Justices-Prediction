this
is
the
way
you
get
more
milk
to
some
children
by
giving
none
to
others.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
as
far
as
the
children
are
concerned,
that's
what
it
comes
down
to
isn't
it?
you
can
give
more
milk
to
some
children
by
giving
none
to
others.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
others
state
interest
do
you
see?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
only
justification
then?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
no
different
than
saying
that
morally
this
kind
of
relationship
is
wrong
therefore--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
the
state
can
penalize
dependent--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
one
way
i
suppose,
one
way
of
limiting
case
loads
is
to
try
to
prevent--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
there
are
other
message
though
and
they're
not
reaching
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
read
everyday
(voice
overlap),
there
are
other
ways
of
reaching
that
then
by
depriving
those
children
who
are
already
here
of
any
milk
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
your
regulation
say
if
they
come
down
and
said,
“i
gather
your
regulations
says
if
she
comes
down
to
the
case
worker
and
says,
i
have
smaller
amount.
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
check
is
resumed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
reaches
the
mother
whether
she
carries
on
the
relationship
in
her
house
or
in
his.
justice
potter
stewart
or
anywhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
other
states
have
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
typical
of
the
states
not
to
give
adc
to
the
children
of
married
couples,
no
matter
how
impoverished
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
say
a
minority
of
the
states
have
this?
justice
potter
stewart
the
majority
of
the
states
do
not
give
aid
to
dependent
children
if
their
parents
are
married,
no
matter
how
poverty
stricken,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
he
doesn't
adopt
the
children.
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
state
regulation
to
that
effect
cutting
off
the
child
and
if
he
suddenly
acquires
a
stepfather
who
doesn't
adopt
him,
a
state
regulation
in
that
effect
would
be
invalid--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
mr.
garbus
to
say
that
you
think
this
case
that
can
be
decided
in
your
favor
purely
on
the
basis
of
statutory
structure
rather
than
on
any
constitutional,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellant's
brief,
isn't
it?.
justice
potter
stewart
--
equal
protection
point
of
view
but
purely
from
the
statute,
and
you
concluded
that
the
alabama
regulation
was
contrary
that
either
the
federal
statute
or
to
a
federal
regulation,
or
to
a
federal
rule,
would
you
say
then
that
it's
supremacy
clause
question
or
is
it
a
matter
of
treating
the
state
as
an
native
federal
government
in
administering
the
act
and
that
the
alabama
regulation
is
simply
doesn't
authorize
but
a
statute
anymore
than
the
similar
regulation
by
hew
might
not
be
authorized
by
the
statute
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
but
require
a
potential
beneficiary
of
these
grants.
this
child
comes
in
and
says
if
you're
going
to
have
an
adc
program,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
it
in
compliance
with
the
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
insist
that
you
comply
with
the
federal
law
if
you're
dispensing
federal
money.
that's
what
you're
claiming?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
that
question
i
gather,
that
this
federal
law
does,
in
terms,
authorize
the
state
to
do
something
in
this
area,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it
does?
then
what
your
argument
really
is
that
what
is
authorized
does
not
embrace
a
regulation
of
this
kind
because
the
statute
permits
this
kind
of
regulation
only
in
the
context
of
parent
with
an
obligation
of
support,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
whether
or
not
you
phrase
this
as
a
supremacy
argument,
or
simply
a
regulation
outside
the
authority
to
the
states
under
the
statute
to
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wonder
if
you
really
mean
that
or
the
statute
says
that
a
needy
child
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
support,
that's
the
actual
language.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you're
saying
really
is
that
these
children,
not
withstanding
this
relationship
with
the
mother
with
some
other
man,
remain
deprived
of
parental
support,
even
though
she
has
that
relationship
with
another
man.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute
since
this
child
remains
deprived
of
parental
support,
to
say
that
he's
not
entitled
to
the
benefits,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
she
marries
the
man?
even
if
she
marries
the
man,
will
the
children
continue
to
be
getting--
justice
potter
stewart
the
children
are
not
his.
and
she
marries
the
man,
and
he
does
not
adopt
them,
the
children
continue
not
getting
any
support,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
now
a
legal
obligation
to
support
them,
under
alabama
law?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
other
side
claims
that--
justice
potter
stewart
that
properly
construed
the
statute
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
way
you
get
more
