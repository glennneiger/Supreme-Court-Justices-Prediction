ms.
mary
lee
stapp
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
this
honorable
court.
i
represent
the
appellants,
mr.
reuben
k.
king
and
the
state
board
of
pensions
and
security
which
is
the
host
in
making
single
state
agency
in
the
department
of
alabama
responsible
for
the
title
for
of
the
social
security
act,
the
public
assistance
title
known
as
aid
to
dependent
children
in
alabama
and
on
the
national
level,
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
we
have
been
designated
as
a
single
state
agent,
said
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
and
we
are
here
on
a
suit
of
class
action,
suit
in
which
the
three
judge
panel
starts
down
to
alabama
substitute
parent
regulation
as
being
violated
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
lower
court
essentially
held
that
the
regulation
of
deprived,
needy
children
of
equal
protection,
and
we
are
here
to
state
the
validity
of
the
regulation
and
to
show
this
court
that
it
is
a
reasonable
classification
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
alabama
program
and
in
the
effort
we
are
trying
to
make
in
the
program.
the
facts
stated
in
the
opinion
by
the
lower
court
are
essentially
facts
that
both
counsel
agree
upon,
there
is
--
i
will
briefly
state
them.
the
plaintiff
was
the
mother
of
four
children
who
had
been
receiving
a
dependent
children.
the
policy,
the
substitute
parent
policy,
was
the
plot
against
her,
particularly
i
would
say
part
two
of
the
policy.
she
went
into
the
district
court
and
eventually
secured
an
hour
of
which
struck
down
the
entire
regulation.
we
all
contend
that
when
one
of
our
main
contentions
is
that
the
lower
court
was
incorrect
in
striking
down
all
aspects
of
the
regulation
when
only
a
portion
of
it
are
applied
to
the
plaintiff.
we
are
concerned
of
the
differences
and
facts
that
the
lower
court
stated
with
our
version.
the
case
worker
who
terminated
the
aid
in
applying
this
substitute
parent
policy
against
her
learned
of
the
relationship
between
the
plaintiff
and
a
person
we
described
as
a
substitute
father
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
court,
you
might
think
of
it
in
terms
of
a
substitute
spouse.
we
have
a
difficult
semantic
problem
sometime
with
hew
and
in
trying
to
arrive
at
a
good
way
to
say
things.
we
sometimes
are
misstating
the
essence
of
what
we
want
to
tell
you.
this
regulation
which
was
applied
against
the
plaintiff
purported
to
and
did
describe
what
we
call
in
alabama
as
informal
relationships.
and
our
purpose
is
to
try
to
place
these
informal
relationships
for
purposes
of
public
assistance
in
the
same
situation
as
persons
who
are
married.
and
the
reason
is
it’s
because
persons
who
are
married
that
is
needy
families
do
not
get
aid
in
alabama.
the
program
is
restricted
to
able
bodied
persons,
who
do
not
have
any
kind
of
espouse,
for
the
living
in
a
common
law
relationship,
one
that
is
not
recognized
by
law
at
all.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
considered
that
the
case
worker
had
learned
of
the
relationship
from
some
third
party,
i
believe
our
version
of
it
is
that
she
had
read
it
from
the
case
record
but
had
known
about
the
relationship
at
the
time
when
the
policy
was
not
in
effect
or
the
new
case
worker
who
came
in.
and
therefore
went
to
the
plaintiff
and
asked
her
about
this.
and
the
plaintiff
admitted
or
stated
to
the
case
worker,
“yes
this
is
true.
i
do
have
this
relationship
which
fits
part
two
of
the
regulation.”
and
on
that
basis
aid
was
terminated.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
yes,
it
is
and
that’s
mentioned
in
several
places
but
that
is
the
best
place
to
look
on
page
427.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
excuse
me.
let
me
see
that
(voice
overlap).
yes
it
just
began
to
follow
the
substitute.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
and
this
is
the
best
version
because
it
shows
you
how
it
relates
to
the
rest
of
the
--
to
the
program.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
and
we
have
(voice
overlap).
and
i
think
we
might
as
well
get
this
out
on
the
table
right
now.
there
is
no
duty
of
support
necessarily
in
the
substitute
parent
regulation.
this
is
not
based
on
that
concept
at
all.
this
is
a
lesser
election
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
include
informal
groups.
sometimes
the
substitute
father
the
may
owe
a
duty
of
support
to
some
of
the
children.
sometimes
he
just
may
be
living
life
--
sort
of
the
stepfather
as
it
were
without
the
benefit
of
marriage.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
stated
that
in
that
jurisdiction
statement.
and
in
coming
up
here,
we
wanted
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
that
it’s
based
on
the
informal
living
situation
of
the
families.
and
i
would
like
also
get
this
out
on
the
table
while
we
are
talking
about
it.
anyway
you
move
in
this
case,
in
the
classification
you
are
affecting
insular
minorities,
there
is
no
way
that
(voice
overlap).
i
believe
this
court
has
described,
is
it
insular
minorities?
we
are
concerned
in
welfare
with
persons
who
are
very
needy,
who
have
many
needs.
and
any
way
we
move
in
the
welfare
program,
we
are
affecting
many
people.
and
this
is
because
we
have
a
very
limited
program
and
we
are
trying
to
raise
the
variance.
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
purpose
of
this
policy
was
to
take
money
that
was
being
used
on
the
broad
case
load
basis
and
utilize
it
on
a
small
case
load.
and
the
basis
of
doing
this
was
to
eliminate
persons
who
live
in
informal
living
arrangement
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
yes,
that’s
right.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no,
i
think
it
is
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
you
are
approaching
this
purely
from
a
duty
of
support
point
of
view,
i
can
certainly
see
why
you
are
asking
this
question.
it
is
true
in
many
marriage
situations
that
the
father
also
does
not
support
the
children.
in
the
testimony
we
attempt
to
elicit
the
reasonableness
of
using
this
as
a
method.
and
you
will
notice
out
through
the
testimony,
they
kind
of
direct
us
--
of
being
questioned
show
that
many
instances
in
the
married
families
you
do
not
have
an
actual
support
coming
in.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
substitute
spouse.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
and
if
you
think
social
security
act
never
permitted
states
to
make
these
classifications,
i
think
you’re
right
in
asking
this
question.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
may
or
may
not.
in
this
particular
instance,
in
this
particular
case
that
was
true.
yes
sir.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
had
just
hit
the
thing
that
puts
shock
and
horror
in
the
hearts
of
everybody
who
hears
it.
i
think
you
have
exactly
summed
up
the
thing
that
distresses
most
people
when
they
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
initially.
initially
think
in
terms
in
this
policy,
we
consider
that
the
actual
adc
grant
is
a
low
paying
amount
to
a
mother
to
help
her
in
her
primary
duty
of
support,
take
care
of
the
children.
it
is
therefore
of
the
nature
of
the
grant
we
are
speaking
of
that
gives
rise
to
the
question
of
why
we
are
here.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
we
would
consider,
it
is
to
be
used
for
the
child
and
we
would
certainly
hope
that
if
the
state
and
the
federal
government
is
going
to
own
this
trouble
it
is
going
to
be
used
for
the
child.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
know
of
nothing
other
than
the
mother
herself
going
to
the
office
and
stating
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
know
of
nothing
that
the
child
in
this
family
or
the
child
in
the
married
family
can
do.
i
might
point
out
--
in
alabama
the
mere
fact
that
the
people
are
married
disqualifies
the
child.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
that
we
maybe
discriminating
in
the
long
run
more
against
the
married
mother
who
has
a
husband
who
is
not
doing
to
will
for
a
few
weeks.
they
have
no
funds
and
she
looks
at
those
and
sees
the
postman.
and
this
was
true
before
the
regulation.
she
sees
the
postman
deliver
a
check
to
a
woman
who
is
living
out
of
wedlock.
and
i
am
speaking
here
of
the
first
part
of
the
policy
which
we
would
say
is
the
true
living
situation.
she
sees
him
deliver
the
check
to
the
mother
and
she
does
not
get
a
--
because
she
is
married.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
well
i
would
hope
that.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
hope
the
mother
when
she
gets
a
public
assistance
check
does
use
the
check
for
daycare
purposes
but
there’s
no
requirement
that
she
do
so.
so
we
usually
think
of
surplus
commodities
is
taking
care
of
their
food.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
relationship
which
simulates
the
marriage
relationship
is
the
only
one
we
are
concerned
with
here.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
indeed,
we’re
not
concerned—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
indeed,
unless
we
can
make
a
case
to
you.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
it
does
not
simulate
the
marriage
relationship
then
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
have
a
classification
under
deprivation
of
real
support
and
our
theory
on
it
is
this,
that
the
relationships
that
these
persons
live
in
simulate
the
marriage
relationship.
and
since
we
do
not
give
aid
two
able-bodied
married
persons,
we
do
not
think
it
makes
sense
for
a
case
worker
in
interpreting
the
program
to
have
to
not
give
aid
to
one
and
not
give
aid
to
the
other
two.
in
other
words
it
should
be
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
that
two
or
three
very
important
state
interest,
the
main
one
is
the
tremendous
necessity
from
the
point
of
view
of
money
in
the
state
program
to
limit
it.
this
was
true
before
the
adc
freed.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
it
was
only
the
adc
frees
that
(inaudible)
do
us
to
do
this
because
the
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
low,
very
low
grants
that
we
have
been
giving
for
many,
many
years.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
36%
of
me
you
know--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
think
it
permits
a
fair
classification
because
we
would
say
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
would
have
to
consider
in
the
light
of
the
total
program,
the
fact
of
the
tremendous
number
of
children
that
are
not
helped
at
all.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
economic
interest
is
the
real
state
interest
involved
here.
the
desire
to
give
what
is
near
50%
of
meeting
of
need.
we're
not
meeting
100%
of
our
needs,
and
the--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no,
i
think
we've
got
a
much
more
profound
one
and
i
would
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
it
is
the
public's
problem
and
what
they
consider
underwriting
these
persons
who
live
in
infallible
relationships
and
putting
a
financial
premium
on
them.
i
think
this
seriously
is
what
the
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
have
to
stick
with—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
do
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
and
the
tax.
they
would
separate
that
from
the
agency.
i
would
say
there
are
three
very
important
interests
to
be
considered
here.
one
is
the
interest
of
the
state
itself
in
rendering
a
more
responsible
program
to
reduce
case
loads
to
give
an
effective
service
keeping
in
mind
that
we
have
such
a
tremendous
number
of
children
that
are
not
even
beginning
to
be
reached
in
the
program.
the
second
thing
is
this
great
public
concern
and
i
think
it's
much
greater
than
you
may
realize
of
underlying
situations
that
are
tend
to
bring
about
illegitimacy
for
example.
this
is
a
great
one.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
point
out
to
you
on
a
bit.
t's
a
tremendous
problem
and
we
do
try
to
mention
that
all
the
way
during
our
brief.
since
1935,
we
have
given
case
work
services
to
these
families
coming
from
the
informal
living
situations.
and
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
said
on
the
books
and
information
we
give
you
that
we
have
virtually
done
nothing
to
change
the
behavior
if
this
is
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
of
the
persons
caught
up
in
these
informal
living
arrangements.
and
therefore
it
is
seemed
to
many
people
that
it's
time
for
a
fresh
approach.
i
had
a
great
reluctance
in
coming
to
this
point
of
view
and
saying
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
1967—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
well
we
hope
surplus
commodities
and
food
stamps
are
taking
care
of
the
food
problem.
our
children
deprived
of
this
aid
are
eligible
for
that.
this
is
the
money
grant
to
the
mother.
and
we
hope
very
much
that
the
mother
would
use
it.
we
have
the
same
in
alabama
that
the
substitute
father
is
the
one
that
is
bringing
a
way
of
support
to
the
mother.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
regulation
looks
to
the
future
conduit.
it
is
not
concerned
with
what
the
mother
has
done
in
the
past.
it
presents
to
her
a
choice
whether
she
wants
to
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
that's
it.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
it
puts
her
back
into
the
situation
of
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
spouse.
and
this
is
the
basis
of
classification,
purely
in
sentence.
it
is
she
then
and
gets
back
in
the
situation
of
a
person,
of
a
family
where
they
is
deprivation
of
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
think--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
may
need
some
help
on
part
three.
this
was
not
before
the
court.
and
i
don't
think
any
of
the
candid
directors
in
their
testimony
indicated
that
it
had
been
used.
i
would
say,
we
need
help
from
the
court
not
a
definition
if
this
does
not
purport
with
a
good
definition
of
a
marital
relationship.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
by
regulation.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
you
have
certainly
hit
what
the
law
of
court
said
in
suitable
home
policy.
i
believe
that's
what
you're
referring
to.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
it
stands
up
very
well
with
the
georgia
regulation
which
has
been
approved
since
it
was
patterned
on
georgia
regulation
and
it
has
been
approved.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
want
to
reserve
10
minutes
--
i
found
that
my
light
went
on
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
don't
think
it's
clear
in
the
first
place.
the
second
place
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
it
prevented
us
from
making
a
classification
which
might
put
married
persons
in
a
deprived
situation.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
want
us
to
a
–
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
do
have
a
question
with
that.
now
i'll
try
to
reach
it
in
my
next
10
minutes.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
in
our
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
lies
question,
we
must
comply
with
the
federal
regulation,
yes.
hew
has
not
disapproved
our
policy.
it
is
under
an
ao,
a
negotiation
statues.
we
consider
that
it
is
very
much
like
those
states
who
have
been
approved,
and
therefore--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
there's
a
disagreement
on
this.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
you
construed
the
statute
like
mr.
garbus
suggests,
then
hew
would
never
have
had
authority
to
permit
any
state
to
carve
out
lesser
classifications.
our
theory
and
a
theory
all
over
the
country
for
years,
has
been
a
child
doesn't
get
aid
if
there
are
two
able-bodied
persons
in
the
home.
and
this
able-bodied
person
does
not
have
to
be
a
person
who
owes
a
duty
of
support.
our
regulation
sets
out
to
define
the
(inaudible)
of
an
able-bodied
person
who
is
not
married
to
the
mother.
so
i
think
you'd
want
to
remember--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we're
asking
for
help
on
that
part
of
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
as
i
said,
that
part
of
the
regulation
has
not
been
used,
and
we
would
like
your
help
on
that.
if
you'd
see
fit
to
permit
states
to
continue
to
make
classifications
based
on
two
able-bodied
parents.
i
would
say
that
many
states
may
decide
that
this
would
be
the
basis
to
elect
whether
or
not
to
continue
on
having
an
adc
program,
because
this
does
affect
case
loads
quite
a
bit.
and
i
would--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
would
like
you
to
reverse
the
lower
court.
we
would
like
you
to
hold
alabama
regulations
valid,
particularly,
parts
one
and
two.
and
then
if
you
think
part
three
needs
a
little
further
clarification,
i
think
this
court
could
do
adopt
to
that
up
a
little.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i'd
like
to.
yes.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
one
of
the--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
call
this
informal
polygamy
(laughter).
and
we
don't
think
it
should
be
favored.
we
do
not
think
it
should
be
favored
in
public
assistance
programs.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
a
substitute
spouse
is
a
better
word.
some
states
just
ought
to
not
use
the
term
“substitute
spouse”.
i
think
in
some
societies,
polygamy
has
been
recognized
as
a
way
of
life.
we
do
not
think
that
this
reflects
the
way
in
which
we
do
things
in
his
country,
and
therefore,
should
be
discouraged.
we
have
finally
come
to
the
position
that
this
type
of
situation,
the--
excuse
me.
what?
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
there's
great
problems
involved
in
making
a
decision
eventually,
that
welfare
departments,
who
cannot
disassociate
themselves
from
the
informal
practices.
and
i
wish
this
court
is
really
considering
our
problem
with
us.
if
you
do
take
the
course
that's
suggested
by
mr.
garbus,
you
will
not
abolish
informal
practices.
you
will
not
make
it
possible
for
a
case
worker
to
explain
why
she
terminates
a
grant.
she
will
still
have
the
problem
of
saying
to
a
family
who
lives
out
of
wedlock,
“yes,
you
get
a
check,
but
if
you're
married,
you
do
not.”
the
court
suggested
here
does
not
obviate
the
problems,
the
real
problems
of
informal
relationships,
and
what
to
do
about
them.
and
we
think
there's
a
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
they
have
a
standing,
that
is
separate
from
her
as
a
grantee
relative
receiving
a
check
to
spend
it.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
they
have
a
standing
that
is
separate
from
hers,
then
we
may--
we
may
misconceive
and
put
an
adc
program
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
is
this
part
two
of
the
regulation
you're
speaking
of?
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
part
one
is
the
true
living.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
justice,
i
would
like
to
mention
in
connection
with
the
statutory
construction,
there
are
excellent
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
on
this
point,
rely
on
the
house
version
of
what
the
house
bill
suggested.
i
do
not
have
this
in
my
brief,
and
i
would
appreciate
if
you're
looking
at
the
remarks
of
senator
harrison,
who
is
construing
what
deprivation
of
parental
support
meant.
and
i
believe
senator
black
was
answering
here
that
there
--
in
senate,
he
stated
“a
state
will
not
have
to
aid
every
child
which
it
finds
to
be
in
need.”
obviously,
for
many
states,
that
would
be
too
large
a
burden.
it
may
limit
aid
to
children
living
with
their
widowed
mother.
oh,
it
can
include
children
without
parents
living
with
near
relatives.
this
is
not
included
in
my
brief,
and
it
is
in
the
congressional
record
at
--
in
the
1935
congressional
record.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
will
have
to--
i
think
it's
on
my
other
notes.
i
would
like
you
to
consider
this
but
the
senate
was
listening
to
it
in
the
debate,
as
well
as
the
house.
i
hope
i'll
be
able
to
print
this
that
changes
to
me.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
thank
you.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
let's
see.
this
regulation
is
not
supposed
to
relate
to
occasional
relationships.
my
time
is
up.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
this
honorable
court.
i
represent
the
appellants,
mr.
reuben
k.
king
and
the
state
board
of
pensions
and
security
which
is
the
host
in
making
single
state
agency
in
the
department
of
alabama
responsible
for
the
title
for
of
the
social
security
act,
the
public
assistance
title
known
as
aid
to
dependent
children
in
alabama
and
on
the
national
level,
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
we
have
been
designated
as
a
single
state
agent,
said
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
and
we
are
here
on
a
suit
of
class
action,
suit
in
which
the
three
judge
panel
starts
down
to
alabama
substitute
parent
regulation
as
being
violated
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
lower
court
essentially
held
that
the
regulation
of
deprived,
needy
children
of
equal
protection,
and
we
are
here
to
state
the
validity
of
the
regulation
and
to
show
this
court
that
it
is
a
reasonable
classification
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
alabama
program
and
in
the
effort
we
are
trying
to
make
in
the
program.
the
facts
stated
in
the
opinion
by
the
lower
court
are
essentially
facts
that
both
counsel
agree
upon,
there
is
--
i
will
briefly
state
them.
the
plaintiff
was
the
mother
of
four
children
who
had
been
receiving
a
dependent
children.
the
policy,
the
substitute
parent
policy,
was
the
plot
against
her,
particularly
i
would
say
part
two
of
the
policy.
she
went
into
the
district
court
and
eventually
secured
an
hour
of
which
struck
down
the
entire
regulation.
we
all
contend
that
when
one
of
our
main
contentions
is
that
the
lower
court
was
incorrect
in
striking
down
all
aspects
of
the
regulation
when
only
a
portion
of
it
are
applied
to
the
plaintiff.
we
are
concerned
of
the
differences
and
facts
that
the
lower
court
stated
with
our
version.
the
case
worker
who
terminated
the
aid
in
applying
this
substitute
parent
policy
against
her
learned
of
the
relationship
between
the
plaintiff
and
a
person
we
described
as
a
substitute
father
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
court,
you
might
think
of
it
in
terms
of
a
substitute
spouse.
we
have
a
difficult
semantic
problem
sometime
with
hew
and
in
trying
to
arrive
at
a
good
way
to
say
things.
we
sometimes
are
misstating
the
essence
of
what
we
want
to
tell
you.
this
regulation
which
was
applied
against
the
plaintiff
purported
to
and
did
describe
what
we
call
in
alabama
as
informal
relationships.
and
our
purpose
is
to
try
to
place
these
informal
relationships
for
purposes
of
public
assistance
in
the
same
situation
as
persons
who
are
married.
and
the
reason
is
it’s
because
persons
who
are
married
that
is
needy
families
do
not
get
aid
in
alabama.
the
program
is
restricted
to
able
bodied
persons,
who
do
not
have
any
kind
of
espouse,
for
the
living
in
a
common
law
relationship,
one
that
is
not
recognized
by
law
at
all.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
considered
that
the
case
worker
had
learned
of
the
relationship
from
some
third
party,
i
believe
our
version
of
it
is
that
she
had
read
it
from
the
case
record
but
had
known
about
the
relationship
at
the
time
when
the
policy
was
not
in
effect
or
the
new
case
worker
who
came
in.
and
therefore
went
to
the
plaintiff
and
asked
her
about
this.
and
the
plaintiff
admitted
or
stated
to
the
case
worker,
“yes
this
is
true.
i
do
have
this
relationship
which
fits
part
two
of
the
regulation.”
and
on
that
basis
aid
was
terminated.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
yes,
it
is
and
that’s
mentioned
in
several
places
but
that
is
the
best
place
to
look
on
page
427.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
excuse
me.
let
me
see
that
(voice
overlap).
yes
it
just
began
to
follow
the
substitute.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
and
this
is
the
best
version
because
it
shows
you
how
it
relates
to
the
rest
of
the
--
to
the
program.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
and
we
have
(voice
overlap).
and
i
think
we
might
as
well
get
this
out
on
the
table
right
now.
there
is
no
duty
of
support
necessarily
in
the
substitute
parent
regulation.
this
is
not
based
on
that
concept
at
all.
this
is
a
lesser
election
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
include
informal
groups.
sometimes
the
substitute
father
the
may
owe
a
duty
of
support
to
some
of
the
children.
sometimes
he
just
may
be
living
life
--
sort
of
the
stepfather
as
it
were
without
the
benefit
of
marriage.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
stated
that
in
that
jurisdiction
statement.
and
in
coming
up
here,
we
wanted
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
that
it’s
based
on
the
informal
living
situation
of
the
families.
and
i
would
like
also
get
this
out
on
the
table
while
we
are
talking
about
it.
anyway
you
move
in
this
case,
in
the
classification
you
are
affecting
insular
minorities,
there
is
no
way
that
(voice
overlap).
i
believe
this
court
has
described,
is
it
insular
minorities?
we
are
concerned
in
welfare
with
persons
who
are
very
needy,
who
have
many
needs.
and
any
way
we
move
in
the
welfare
program,
we
are
affecting
many
people.
and
this
is
because
we
have
a
very
limited
program
and
we
are
trying
to
raise
the
variance.
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
purpose
of
this
policy
was
to
take
money
that
was
being
used
on
the
broad
case
load
basis
and
utilize
it
on
a
small
case
load.
and
the
basis
of
doing
this
was
to
eliminate
persons
who
live
in
informal
living
arrangement
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
yes,
that’s
right.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no,
i
think
it
is
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
you
are
approaching
this
purely
from
a
duty
of
support
point
of
view,
i
can
certainly
see
why
you
are
asking
this
question.
it
is
true
in
many
marriage
situations
that
the
father
also
does
not
support
the
children.
in
the
testimony
we
attempt
to
elicit
the
reasonableness
of
using
this
as
a
method.
and
you
will
notice
out
through
the
testimony,
they
kind
of
direct
us
--
of
being
questioned
show
that
many
instances
in
the
married
families
you
do
not
have
an
actual
support
coming
in.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
substitute
spouse.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
and
if
you
think
social
security
act
never
permitted
states
to
make
these
classifications,
i
think
you’re
right
in
asking
this
question.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
may
or
may
not.
in
this
particular
instance,
in
this
particular
case
that
was
true.
yes
sir.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
had
just
hit
the
thing
that
puts
shock
and
horror
in
the
hearts
of
everybody
who
hears
it.
i
think
you
have
exactly
summed
up
the
thing
that
distresses
most
people
when
they
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
initially.
initially
think
in
terms
in
this
policy,
we
consider
that
the
actual
adc
grant
is
a
low
paying
amount
to
a
mother
to
help
her
in
her
primary
duty
of
support,
take
care
of
the
children.
it
is
therefore
of
the
nature
of
the
grant
we
are
speaking
of
that
gives
rise
to
the
question
of
why
we
are
here.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
we
would
consider,
it
is
to
be
used
for
the
child
and
we
would
certainly
hope
that
if
the
state
and
the
federal
government
is
going
to
own
this
trouble
it
is
going
to
be
used
for
the
child.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
know
of
nothing
other
than
the
mother
herself
going
to
the
office
and
stating
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
know
of
nothing
that
the
child
in
this
family
or
the
child
in
the
married
family
can
do.
i
might
point
out
--
in
alabama
the
mere
fact
that
the
people
are
married
disqualifies
the
child.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
that
we
maybe
discriminating
in
the
long
run
more
against
the
married
mother
who
has
a
husband
who
is
not
doing
to
will
for
a
few
weeks.
they
have
no
funds
and
she
looks
at
those
and
sees
the
postman.
and
this
was
true
before
the
regulation.
she
sees
the
postman
deliver
a
check
to
a
woman
who
is
living
out
of
wedlock.
and
i
am
speaking
here
of
the
first
part
of
the
policy
which
we
would
say
is
the
true
living
situation.
she
sees
him
deliver
the
check
to
the
mother
and
she
does
not
get
a
--
because
she
is
married.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
well
i
would
hope
that.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
hope
the
mother
when
she
gets
a
public
assistance
check
does
use
the
check
for
daycare
purposes
but
there’s
no
requirement
that
she
do
so.
so
we
usually
think
of
surplus
commodities
is
taking
care
of
their
food.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
relationship
which
simulates
the
marriage
relationship
is
the
only
one
we
are
concerned
with
here.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
indeed,
we’re
not
concerned—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no
indeed,
unless
we
can
make
a
case
to
you.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
it
does
not
simulate
the
marriage
relationship
then
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
have
a
classification
under
deprivation
of
real
support
and
our
theory
on
it
is
this,
that
the
relationships
that
these
persons
live
in
simulate
the
marriage
relationship.
and
since
we
do
not
give
aid
two
able-bodied
married
persons,
we
do
not
think
it
makes
sense
for
a
case
worker
in
interpreting
the
program
to
have
to
not
give
aid
to
one
and
not
give
aid
to
the
other
two.
in
other
words
it
should
be
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
that
two
or
three
very
important
state
interest,
the
main
one
is
the
tremendous
necessity
from
the
point
of
view
of
money
in
the
state
program
to
limit
it.
this
was
true
before
the
adc
freed.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
it
was
only
the
adc
frees
that
(inaudible)
do
us
to
do
this
because
the
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
low,
very
low
grants
that
we
have
been
giving
for
many,
many
years.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
36%
of
me
you
know--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
think
it
permits
a
fair
classification
because
we
would
say
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
would
have
to
consider
in
the
light
of
the
total
program,
the
fact
of
the
tremendous
number
of
children
that
are
not
helped
at
all.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
economic
interest
is
the
real
state
interest
involved
here.
the
desire
to
give
what
is
near
50%
of
meeting
of
need.
we're
not
meeting
100%
of
our
needs,
and
the--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
no,
i
think
we've
got
a
much
more
profound
one
and
i
would
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
it
is
the
public's
problem
and
what
they
consider
underwriting
these
persons
who
live
in
infallible
relationships
and
putting
a
financial
premium
on
them.
i
think
this
seriously
is
what
the
--
(voice

ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
have
to
stick
with—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
you
do
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
and
the
tax.
they
would
separate
that
from
the
agency.
i
would
say
there
are
three
very
important
interests
to
be
considered
here.
one
is
the
interest
of
the
state
itself
in
rendering
a
more
responsible
program
to
reduce
case
loads
to
give
an
effective
service
keeping
in
mind
that
we
have
such
a
tremendous
number
of
children
that
are
not
even
beginning
to
be
reached
in
the
program.
the
second
thing
is
this
great
public
concern
and
i
think
it's
much
greater
than
you
may
realize
of
underlying
situations
that
are
tend
to
bring
about
illegitimacy
for
example.
this
is
a
great
one.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
point
out
to
you
on
a
bit.
t's
a
tremendous
problem
and
we
do
try
to
mention
that
all
the
way
during
our
brief.
since
1935,
we
have
given
case
work
services
to
these
families
coming
from
the
informal
living
situations.
and
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
said
on
the
books
and
information
we
give
you
that
we
have
virtually
done
nothing
to
change
the
behavior
if
this
is
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
of
the
persons
caught
up
in
these
informal
living
arrangements.
and
therefore
it
is
seemed
to
many
people
that
it's
time
for
a
fresh
approach.
i
had
a
great
reluctance
in
coming
to
this
point
of
view
and
saying
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
the
1967—
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
well
we
hope
surplus
commodities
and
food
stamps
are
taking
care
of
the
food
problem.
our
children
deprived
of
this
aid
are
eligible
for
that.
this
is
the
money
grant
to
the
mother.
and
we
hope
very
much
that
the
mother
would
use
it.
we
have
the
same
in
alabama
that
the
substitute
father
is
the
one
that
is
bringing
a
way
of
support
to
the
mother.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
regulation
looks
to
the
future
conduit.
it
is
not
concerned
with
what
the
mother
has
done
in
the
past.
it
presents
to
her
a
choice
whether
she
wants
to
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
that's
it.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
say
it
puts
her
back
into
the
situation
of
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
spouse.
and
this
is
the
basis
of
classification,
purely
in
sentence.
it
is
she
then
and
gets
back
in
the
situation
of
a
person,
of
a
family
where
they
is
deprivation
of
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
think--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
may
need
some
help
on
part
three.
this
was
not
before
the
court.
and
i
don't
think
any
of
the
candid
directors
in
their
testimony
indicated
that
it
had
been
used.
i
would
say,
we
need
help
from
the
court
not
a
definition
if
this
does
not
purport
with
a
good
definition
of
a
marital
relationship.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
by
regulation.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
you
have
certainly
hit
what
the
law
of
court
said
in
suitable
home
policy.
i
believe
that's
what
you're
referring
to.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
it
stands
up
very
well
with
the
georgia
regulation
which
has
been
approved
since
it
was
patterned
on
georgia
regulation
and
it
has
been
approved.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
want
to
reserve
10
minutes
--
i
found
that
my
light
went
on
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
don't
think
it's
clear
in
the
first
place.
the
second
place
(voice
overlap)
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
it
prevented
us
from
making
a
classification
which
might
put
married
persons
in
a
deprived
situation.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
want
us
to
a
–
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
do
have
a
question
with
that.
now
i'll
try
to
reach
it
in
my
next
10
minutes.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
in
our
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
lies
question,
we
must
comply
with
the
federal
regulation,
yes.
hew
has
not
disapproved
our
policy.
it
is
under
an
ao,
a
negotiation
statues.
we
consider
that
it
is
very
much
like
those
states
who
have
been
approved,
and
therefore--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
there's
a
disagreement
on
this.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
you
construed
the
statute
like
mr.
garbus
suggests,
then
hew
would
never
have
had
authority
to
permit
any
state
to
carve
out
lesser
classifications.
our
theory
and
a
theory
all
over
the
country
for
years,
has
been
a
child
doesn't
get
aid
if
there
are
two
able-bodied
persons
in
the
home.
and
this
able-bodied
person
does
not
have
to
be
a
person
who
owes
a
duty
of
support.
our
regulation
sets
out
to
define
the
(inaudible)
of
an
able-bodied
person
who
is
not
married
to
the
mother.
so
i
think
you'd
want
to
remember--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we're
asking
for
help
on
that
part
of
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
as
i
said,
that
part
of
the
regulation
has
not
been
used,
and
we
would
like
your
help
on
that.
if
you'd
see
fit
to
permit
states
to
continue
to
make
classifications
based
on
two
able-bodied
parents.
i
would
say
that
many
states
may
decide
that
this
would
be
the
basis
to
elect
whether
or
not
to
continue
on
having
an
adc
program,
because
this
does
affect
case
loads
quite
a
bit.
and
i
would--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
would
like
you
to
reverse
the
lower
court.
we
would
like
you
to
hold
alabama
regulations
valid,
particularly,
parts
one
and
two.
and
then
if
you
think
part
three
needs
a
little
further
clarification,
i
think
this
court
could
do
adopt
to
that
up
a
little.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i'd
like
to.
yes.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
one
of
the--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
we
call
this
informal
polygamy
(laughter).
and
we
don't
think
it
should
be
favored.
we
do
not
think
it
should
be
favored
in
public
assistance
programs.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
a
substitute
spouse
is
a
better
word.
some
states
just
ought
to
not
use
the
term
“substitute
spouse”.
i
think
in
some
societies,
polygamy
has
been
recognized
as
a
way
of
life.
we
do
not
think
that
this
reflects
the
way
in
which
we
do
things
in
his
country,
and
therefore,
should
be
discouraged.
we
have
finally
come
to
the
position
that
this
type
of
situation,
the--
excuse
me.
what?
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
think
there's
great
problems
involved
in
making
a
decision
eventually,
that
welfare
departments,
who
cannot
disassociate
themselves
from
the
informal
practices.
and
i
wish
this
court
is
really
considering
our
problem
with
us.
if
you
do
take
the
course
that's
suggested
by
mr.
garbus,
you
will
not
abolish
informal
practices.
you
will
not
make
it
possible
for
a
case
worker
to
explain
why
she
terminates
a
grant.
she
will
still
have
the
problem
of
saying
to
a
family
who
lives
out
of
wedlock,
“yes,
you
get
a
check,
but
if
you're
married,
you
do
not.”
the
court
suggested
here
does
not
obviate
the
problems,
the
real
problems
of
informal
relationships,
and
what
to
do
about
them.
and
we
think
there's
a
--
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
they
have
a
standing,
that
is
separate
from
her
as
a
grantee
relative
receiving
a
check
to
spend
it.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
if
they
have
a
standing
that
is
separate
from
hers,
then
we
may--
we
may
misconceive
and
put
an
adc
program
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
is
this
part
two
of
the
regulation
you're
speaking
of?
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
part
one
is
the
true
living.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
justice,
i
would
like
to
mention
in
connection
with
the
statutory
construction,
there
are
excellent
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
on
this
point,
rely
on
the
house
version
of
what
the
house
bill
suggested.
i
do
not
have
this
in
my
brief,
and
i
would
appreciate
if
you're
looking
at
the
remarks
of
senator
harrison,
who
is
construing
what
deprivation
of
parental
support
meant.
and
i
believe
senator
black
was
answering
here
that
there
--
in
senate,
he
stated
“a
state
will
not
have
to
aid
every
child
which
it
finds
to
be
in
need.”
obviously,
for
many
states,
that
would
be
too
large
a
burden.
it
may
limit
aid
to
children
living
with
their
widowed
mother.
oh,
it
can
include
children
without
parents
living
with
near
relatives.
this
is
not
included
in
my
brief,
and
it
is
in
the
congressional
record
at
--
in
the
1935
congressional
record.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
i
will
have
to--
i
think
it's
on
my
other
notes.
i
would
like
you
to
consider
this
but
the
senate
was
listening
to
it
in
the
debate,
as
well
as
the
house.
i
hope
i'll
be
able
to
print
this
that
changes
to
me.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
thank
you.
ms.
mary
lee
stapp
let's
see.
this
regulation
is
not
supposed
to
relate
to
occasional
relationships.
my
time
is
up.
