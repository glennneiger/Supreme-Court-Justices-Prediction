--
to
wind
up
and
go
into
court
all
the
time.
these
litigants
do
not
have
big
pockets
to
pay
expenses
and
so
you
have
the
proposition
which
would
affect
mr.
nizer's
case
more
than
mine
but
if
the
local
exhibitor
owed
in
contest
within
the

classified

would
there
have
to
bear
the
--
mr.
grover

--
marketing.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
i
think
as
soon
as
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
if
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no
sir.
the
default
judgment
certainly
should
be
taken
but
that
leaves
again
free
speech
unprotected
because
a
man
takes
one
of
these
pictures
and
has
a
limited
license
a
small
fee
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
one
that
mr.
nizer
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no
sir,
what
i'm
complaining
about
if
i
may
say
is
this
that
they
talked
about
freedman
and
they
changed
their
position
on
freedman.
freedman's
overall
burden
mentioned
that
prior
maryland
case,
that's
the
real
thrust
of
this
argument.
there,
it
mentioned
maryland
versus
united
artist
and
board
of
censors
in
1956
and
it
admit
--
it
pointed
out
that
the
risk
of
delay
was
built
into
the
only
reported
case
in
maryland
because
it
took
six
months
from
trial
to
final
decision.
now,
six
months
was
what
mistaken
there,
the
record
of
viva
maria
is
eight-and-a-half
months.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
suit
was
filed
in
a
maryland
censor
case
on
february
28th
and
july
13th.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
my
case
was
eight-and-a-half
months.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice.
the
final
judicial
determination,
if
the
court
please,
in
texas.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
february
18th,
the
picture
was
filed
with
the
board
on
the
9th
of
february,
i
believe.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
alright.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
say,
it
would
be
close
enough,
i
wouldn't
argue.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
toward
the
end
of
the
opinion,
this
court
did
not
only
used
words
idly
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
and
i
understand
that.
but
from
final,
the
word
“final”
that
came
in
here
was
expelled
out.
also,
the
opinion
states
to
avoid
the
danger
of
an
interim
and
possibly
erroneous
denial
of
a
license.
now,
an
interim
is
possibly
erroneous
denial
of
a
license
is
exactly
what
may
have
happened
to
us
here
in
judge
taft's
decision
at
the
trial
level.
but
this
term
final
judicial
determination
was
understood
by
maryland
to
advance
and
require
an
amendment
of
its
statute
which
is
done,
that's
reported
in
trans-lux
that
is
cited
in
my
brief.
now,
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
if
i
may
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
they
could
but
we
have
the
unique
situation,
your
honor.
the
legislature
was
in
session
in
1967,
when
freedman
came
out,
they
did
nothing.
but
in
1967,
they
were
in
session
again
and
on
page
17
of
my
brief
we
have
been
managing
general
insurance
agent
site.
and
that
thing
gives
the
priority
to
an
insurance
salesman's
license.
the
likes
of
which
the
first
amendment
should
get,
it
goes
to
the
first
docket
at
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
i
mean,
no
worries
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
i
think
it
can
leave
freedman
as
it
was.
the
court
there
said
it
was
not
spending
out
the
exact
time
but
the
spirit
of
freedman
was
a
prompt
final
judicial
determination.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
the
exactly
true
if
the
court
please.
but
if
the
state
of
texas
is
what
said
about
in
freedman
and
then
maryland
how
or
whether
maryland
is
to
incorporate
the
required
procedural
safeguards
in
the
statutory
scheme
is
of
course
for
the
state
of
maryland
to
decide.
that's
exactly
true
for
texas
if
they
won't
to
avail
themselves
this.
the
legislature
could
give
these
cases
the
priority
equivalent
to
what
it
gave
to
the
insurance
agent.
that's
all
we're
asking
for
from
this
--
when
state
policy
gives
the
priority
an
insurance
agent's
license
and
it
literally
gives
to
the
head
of
everything
throughout
the
state.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
if
you
put
on
it
not
suitable
for
children
and
we
define
a
young
person
and
define
what
they
are
in
the
broad
principle
as
i
mentioned
earlier
if
the
court
please.
in
the
broad
principle,
what
is
the
difference
between
not
suitable
for
18
and
not
suitable
for
16?
if
i
were
to
judge
by
standard
or
ask
anyone
else
to
how
would
i
sensibly
measure
a
difference
and
consider
this
book
would
pass
for
18
but
this
book
would
not
pass
for
16.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
true
if
the
court
please.
i
certainly
agree
with
that
but
we're
not
called
upon
as
we
understand
this
is
so
restricted
because
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no.
they
may
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
the
relevance
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we
say
that
relevance
is
this,
if
the
court
please,
we
come
to
a
relevant
item
because
the
city
of
dallas
set
out
to
come
under
your
clear-and-present-danger
doctrine
for
18
year
olds,
and
obviously
people
who
would
be
in
a
juvenile
crime
group
would
be
at
the
senior
part
of
this,
they
fell
away
from
the
18
standard
and
went
to
16.
16
is
a
little
more
appealing,
but
if
we
sustain
this
preset
which
they're
holding
for
here,
then
we
can
immediately
find
18,
19,
or
whatever
age
on
up
unto
21.
in
the
broad
principle
until
there
is
some
showing,
we
submit
that
it
is
time
for
--
enough
to
prove
this
before
and
to
prove
for
example
if
there
is
such
proof
that
this
causes
this
crime
way
where
there
are
some
reason
for
restraint,
but
until
that
is
done
a
presumption
in
favor
of
free
speech.
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
certainly
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
we,
i
did
not
come
here
arguing
an
18-year-old
child
that
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
picture
show
by
himself
very
obviously
but
i
wouldn't
say
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
certainly
concur
in
that
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
big
reasons
obviously.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
mean
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
sense,
i
would
say
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
for
this
simple
reason.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
read
that
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
read
--
i
have
read
that
that
is
if
i
understand
it
correctly
that
concept
is
written
into
a
prompt
final
judicial
determination
here.
now,
i
must
say
mr.--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we'll,
we've
got
a
judgment
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
final
judgment
as
we
understand
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
it
was
an
appealable
judgment,
in
that
sense,
the
final,
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
it
was
final
in
that
sense.
but
at
the
same
time,
when
they
spoke
of
the
appellate
judgment
in
the
maryland
case
of
1956,
if
the
court
please,
we
understood
that
to
mean
both
trial
and
appellate
when
they
have
said
six
months
for
trial
in
appellate
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
think
it
is
tremendous
if
the
court
please.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
freedman
given
a
reason
and
interpretation
means
that
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
you
don't
cut
it
off
there,
but
you
have
to
review
there.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
true.
but
the
determination
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does
not
have
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
reasonable
time.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
oh,
i
think
he
could
be
under
that
kind
of
an
ordinance
or
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no.
i
say
--
excuse
me,
i
understood
--
can
he
be
convicted,
i
thought
you
asked
me,
yes
he
could
be
convicted
unless
you're
going
to
follow
and
say
that
free
speech
is
going
to
prevail.
the
ordinance
i
think
has
got
to
fall
on
the
first
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
and
also
the
rights
of
the
children
as
the
gault
case
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
the
normal
exception
but
your
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
the
technical
reading
of
this
ordinance
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
nizer
yesterday
makes
that
an
affirmative
defense
only.
we
have
never
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we
have
never
gotten
around
to
that
part
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
yes,
that's
where
we
were,
yesterday.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
if
he
had
his
wife
with
him
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
to
wind
up
and
go
into
court
all
the
time.
these
litigants
do
not
have

to

and
so

16?
if
i
were
to
judge
by
standard
or
ask
anyone
else
to
how
would
i
sensibly
measure
a
difference
and
consider
this
book
would
pass
for
18
but
this
book
would
not
pass
for
16.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
true
if
the
court
please.
i
certainly
agree
with
that
but
we're
not
called
upon
as
we
understand
this
is
so
restricted
because
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no.
they
may
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
the
relevance
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we
say
that
relevance
is
this,
if
the
court
please,
we
come
to
a
relevant
item
because
the
city
of
dallas
set
out
to
come
under
your
clear-and-present-danger
doctrine
for
18
year
olds,
and
obviously
people
who
would
be
in
a
juvenile
crime
group
would
be
at
the
senior
part
of
this,
they
fell
away
from
the
18
standard
and
went
to
16.
16
is
a
little
more
appealing,
but
if
we
sustain
this
preset
which
they're
holding
for
here,
then
we
can
immediately
find
18,
19,
or
whatever
age
on
up
unto
21.
in
the
broad
principle
until
there
is
some
showing,
we
submit
that
it
is
time
for
--
enough
to
prove
this
before
and
to
prove
for
example
if
there
is
such
proof
that
this
causes
this
crime
way
where
there
are
some
reason
for
restraint,
but
until
that
is
done
a
presumption
in
favor
of
free
speech.
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
certainly
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
--
we,
i
did
not
come
here
arguing
an
18-year-old
child
that
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
picture
show
by
himself
very
obviously
but
i
wouldn't
say
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
certainly
concur
in
that
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
big
reasons
obviously.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
mean
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
sense,
i
would
say
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
for
this
simple
reason.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
read
that
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
read
--
i
have
read
that
that
is
if
i
understand
it
correctly
that
concept
is
written
into
a
prompt
final
judicial
determination
here.
now,
i
must
say
mr.--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we'll,
we've
got
a
judgment
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
final
judgment
as
we
understand
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
it
was
an
appealable
judgment,
in
that
sense,
the
final,
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
it
was
final
in
that
sense.
but
at
the
same
time,
when
they
spoke
of
the
appellate
judgment
in
the
maryland
case
of
1956,
if
the
court
please,
we
understood
that
to
mean
both
trial
and
appellate
when
they
have
said
six
months
for
trial
in
appellate
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
would
think
it
is
tremendous
if
the
court
please.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
freedman
given
a
reason
and
interpretation
means
that
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
you
don't
cut
it
off
there,
but
you
have
to
review
there.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that
is
true.
but
the
determination
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does
not
have
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
reasonable
time.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
oh,
i
think
he
could
be
under
that
kind
of
an
ordinance
or
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
no.
i
say
--
excuse
me,
i
understood
--
can
he
be
convicted,
i
thought
you
asked
me,
yes
he
could
be
convicted
unless
you're
going
to
follow
and
say
that
free
speech
is
going
to
prevail.
the
ordinance
i
think
has
got
to
fall
on
the
first
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
and
also
the
rights
of
the
children
as
the
gault
case
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
the
normal
exception
but
your
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
the
technical
reading
of
this
ordinance
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
nizer
yesterday
makes
that
an
affirmative
defense
only.
we
have
never
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
we
have
never
gotten
around
to
that
part
--
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
yes.
yes,
that's
where
we
were,
yesterday.
mr.
grover
hartt,
jr.
well,
if
he
had
his
wife
with
him
--
