justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hartt,
wouldn't
you
think
that
an
18-year-old
gi
from
saigon
that
not
be
corrupted
by
a
movie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
not
be
the
reason
it
got
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
that
be
the
reason
they
got
from
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
18
to
16?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
this
question
of
time,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
of
texas
in
order
to
uphold
this
ordinance
must
get
precedent
to
your
case
over
a
speedy
trial
in
murdock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
i
read
somebody's
speedy
trial
in
a
certain
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
in
the
constitution
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
final
judicial
determination?
didn't
you
get
a
final
judgment
in
the
trial
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
the
final
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
your
final
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
had
to
be
final.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
today,
isn't
it
an
eight-month
determination
by
the
highest
court
of
the
states
speedy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said,
you
could
prevent
them
from
attending
any
movie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
couldn't
pick
and
choose
the
movie
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
he
can
see?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
understood
you
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bickley,
what's
wrong
with
this
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
margin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
for
example
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
is
it
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
reason
that
the
board
did
not
make
any
findings,
the
reason
that
the
board
relied
on
as
a
whole
phase?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
correct,
am
i
not?
the
board
did
not
give
any
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
they
ever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--how
can
the
distributor
or
united
artist
or
this
court
know
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understand
only
two
members
of
the
board
testified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
do
we
know
now
the
reason
that
the
other
six
voted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
would
be
hearsay
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
hearsay
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bickley
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
i
have
great
trouble
with
your
crying
fire
in
the
crowd
at
theater,
i
think
they
all
agree
that
you
can't
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
somebody
does
cry
fire,
i
have
a
right
to
listen
to
it,
don't
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
(voice

somebody
to
look
at
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
we
have
the
right
to
look
at
the
movie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
an
unescorted
child
under
16.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
listening.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
at
this
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
parent
could
make
this
choice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
see
how
you
get
that
over
into
this
case.
this
case
is
a
picture
that
you
aren't
banning,
you're
just
restricting
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
right
of
people
to
see
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it's
done
without
any
given
reason
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
i
know
that?
i
take
their
word
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
let's
get
our
answers
correct.
you
said
without
giving
all
of
the
reasons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case
they
didn't
give
any
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
board
itself.

a
great
trouble
