mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
associate
justices,
may
i
address
myself
to
the
latest
question
that
was
just
raised.
this
is
about
the
right
of
the
parent
and
the
right
of
children.
this
ordinance
does
provide,
as
we
read
it
and
as
we
interpret
it
and
as
the
city
council
passed,
that
a
parent,
a
guardian,
a
husband,
or
wife
may
take
a
child
or
a
young
person
below
the
age
of
16
years
to
a
movie
that
is
designated
as
not
acceptable
for
young
persons.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
provides
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
mr.
nizer
stated
yesterday
that
in
his
opinion
they
did
have
that
right
maybe
to
prohibit
any
of
them
from
going
any
used
as
an
example
of
pool
halls
which
he
likened
to
the
right
of
assembly
and
he
said
you
could
prevent
young
persons
from
assembling
in
a
pool
hall.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
he
said
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
you
could
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
pick
and
choose,
this
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
alright,
yes,
and
i
--
this
is
what
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to.he
said
but
he
likened
it
to
the
pool
halls
but
he
said
that
he
would
not
accept
the
pool
hall
analogy
because
of
the
fact
that
this
was
based
upon
safety
of
the
young
person.
now,
it
is
with
this
argument
that
i
would
take
disagreement
because
of
the
fact
that
preventing
young
persons
from
going
in
a
pool
hall
is
not
a
safety
provision.
there
is
no
danger
of
falling
off
a
pool
table
or
being
injured
in
the
pool
hall.
it's
the
immorality
that
this
is
actually
directed
to
because
the
ymca's
have
pools
in
many
cities
and
allow
individuals
to
play
young
persons,
to
participate
but
under
certain
conditions.
now,
insofar
as
that
applies
here
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
pick
and
choose,
we
think
that
actually
it
would
be
more
unconstitutional
not
to
pick
and
choose
and
it
would
to
pick
and
choose
for
this
simple
reason,
to
prevent
young
persons
under
the
age
of
16
years
from
attending
any
movie
would
be
the
most
blatant
sort
of
the
restriction
on
the
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
have
seen
the
picture,
yes
sir
on
two
or
three
different
occasions.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
marshall,
let
me
say
this
about
this
picture,
it
is
a
marginal
picture.
i
must
admit
this
to
this
court
and
i'll
be
very
frank
in
this
respect.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
as
was
pointed
out
by
reverend
masio
(ph)
and
i
agree
with
him
in
this
respect,
it
depicts
sexual
promiscuity
in
this
manner.
it
shows
a
woman
who
goes
and
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
meets
three
men
for
the
first
time
in
an
evening
and
goes
and
has
an
evening
with
them
on
all
evening
escapade
which
is
not
shown,
comes
back
in
the
morning
with
their
closed
pool
half
way
off
and
they
shout.
and
she
comes
back
and
she
says,
“this
is
the
life
or
this
is
the
fun
i
have
been
missing”.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
maybe
--
for
some
maybe
it's
not
wrong,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir.
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
implanting
in
the
minds
of
the
young
people
the
thought
to
see
the
play
that
immorality
of
this
sort
--
of
this
kind
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
is
fun
and
the
highest
form
of
life.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
and
desirable,
and
useful.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
say
it
is
marginal,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
prefer
not
to
apply
them
the
marginal
situation.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
that
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
and
this
is
the
reason
i
hope
to
answer
very
carefully
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
on
this.
it
is
hard
to
determine
sometimes
and
i
think
in
cases
of
doubt
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
was
an
eight
to
one
decision.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
marginal
situations
are
the
ones
that
make
lawsuits
and
that's
the
reason
we're
before
this
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
exactly
right
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
not
censors
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
as
we
refer
to
them
your
honor
but
members
of
the
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
would
actually
do
so.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
would
not
ban
it
sir.
it
would
not
prohibit
it.
it
merely
requires
a
label
in
the
advertising.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mu
anwer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
we
do
not
prohibit
anything.
we
merely
say,
let's
have
it's
somewhat
near
the
truth
in
advertising
sort
of
situation,
it's
somewhat
near
the
situation
of
pick
and
choose
if
you
will
but
give
them
something
from
which
to
pick
and
choose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
may
a
city
attorney
and
may
i
answer
you
sir
in
an
example
which
is
a
true
example
on
the
occasions
in
which
i
have
before
this
board
actually
fought
with
them
and
told
them
what
this
court
has
held
and
what
we
think
because
of
marginal
situations
they
could
not
do
and
should
not
do
and
they
have
agreed
to
that
and
they
have
many
instances,
done
things
they
did
not
want
to
do.
personally,
they
disagreed
with
for
this
reason
and
we
take
this
thing
very
seriously
and
for
that
reason
we
have
attempted,
it
is
true,
we've
got
a
situation
here
that
may
make
some
bad
law
because
it
is
the
marginal
case.
but
we
have
attempted
to
counsel
with
the
board
and
to
work
with
them
as
officers
of
the
court
and
attempt
to
protect
these
first
amendment
freedoms
as
best
as
we
can
but
at
the
same
time
giving
to
the
state
the
right
to
protect
its
young
persons,
if
we
can
do
that.
and
we
think
that
maybe
this
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
no,
because
there
are
only
a
very
few
scenes
in
the
whole
picture.
another
one
of
the
scenes
that
i
did
not
described,
your
honor,
was
one
that
occurred
inside
the
--
inside
the
jail
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
one
or
two
more.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
says
in
whole
taken
as
a
whole,
using
the
test
that
has
been
set
out
by
this
court,
that
it
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
would
not
think
it
was
marginal
if
it
--
if
this
was
the
whole
theme
of
the
movie
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
it
--
it
may
--
the
standards
are
hard
to
apply
as
the
obscenity
standard
is
hard
to
apply,
none
of
these
are
easy
as
counsel
admit
--
and
if
they're
hard
to
draw,
they're
hard
to
define,
and
for
this
reason
it
does
make
for
a
hard
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice,
if
you
say
thoroughly,
the
kind
of
thing
it
was
entitled
to
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
it
were
not
marginal
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
the
scene
by
itself
is
not.
the
movie
as
a
whole
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
the
board
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
they
did
not.
they
did
not.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
they
do
not
write
down
the
reasons
for
which
they
do
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
which
they
actually
did
it?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
before
this
court
will
be
confronted
with
that
situation
it
must
be
proven
before
a
judicial
body.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
the
decision
will
have
to
be
made
there.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
can
advise
you,
but
this
is
the
only
way.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
it
would
be
hearsay.
it
would
be
hearsay.
and
i
say
for
that
reason
it's
not
in
the
record
and
it
does
not
show.
but
this
is
the
immaterial
to
a
situation
like
this
because
of
the
fact
that
judge
has
to
make
a
decision
on
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
gave
no
reasons
at
that
particular
time.
no
he
did
not
accept
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
judge
came
in
from
an
outlying
county.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
that's
not
quite
it,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
(voice
overlap)
he
refused
to
make
findings
of
fact
as
such
and
he
did
not
make
them.
he
did
view
the
movie.
he
did
listen
to
the
testimony.
he
did
listen
to
argument
of
counsel
and
he
did
then
make
a
decision
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
had
the
standards
of
a
statute,
he
had
briefs
of
counsel,
he
had
all
of
the
consideration
that
counsel
could
give
him
and
all
of
the
advice
and
the
argument
that
either
of
us
could
give
to
him
at
that
time.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
exactly
what
he
said
your
honor.
but
we
had
been
arguing
with
him
for
quite
some
time
before
he
said
this,
and
had
been
presenting
ideas
back
and
forth
very
freely.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
he
was.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
he
tried
to
follow
the
law
as
best
he
could
understand
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
not
really
sure
of
what
the
understanding
is
when
we
get
in
these
nebulous
fields,
they're
hard,
and
they
are
difficult.
and
so
we
are
all
trying
to
approach
that
thing
which
gives
the
rights
of
both
parties
proper
precedent.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
between
january
14th
of
1966
and
january
10th
of
1968,
there
were
1925
movies
submitted
to
the
board.
of
that
number,
565
of
them
were
classified
as
not
suitable
by
the
exhibitor
himself.
he
asked
for
that
classification
to
be
put
on.
39
were
classified
as
not
suitable
after
screening
by
the
board
itself
and
of
the
movies
classified
suitable,
1226
of
them
were
classified
suitable
as
submitted
by
the
exhibitor
and
59
of
them
were
classified
suitable
after
screening
by
the
committee
and
by
the
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
those
figures
are
not
in
the
brief
sir.
those
figures
are
just
of
recent
vantage.
they
--
actually
we
got
those
on
january
10th,
1968.
we
would
like
to
submit
them
to
the
court
for
their
consideration
in
the
record.
thank
you.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
black,
i'd
hate
to
speculate
with
you
on
that
particular
statement,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
the
first
time
we've
ever
had
an
ordinance
similar
to
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
as
to
this.
we
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
discussed
very
frankly
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sure.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
sir.
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
may
i
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
black.
i
could
no
more
predict
than
i
could
predict
without
benefit
of
counsel
how
much
smut
and
other
type
of
things
would
be
introduced
into
our
system
because
it's
a
two-way
proposition.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
there
would've
been
more
sir,
it's
possible.
insofar
as
the
speedy
remedy
is
concerned
and
the
final
judicial
determination
is
concerned
which
was
being
discussed
just
a
minute
ago,
i'd
like
to
discuss
it
in
a
minute.
in
these
words,
a
careful
reading
of
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
dallas
will
i
think
convince
this
court
of
the
very
onerous
burden
that
the
city
accepted
upon
itself
in
order
that
it
might
provide
every
remedy
known
and
every
opportunity
for
a
speedy
trial
and
speedy
judicial
determination.
now,
if
final
judicial
determination
as
used
in
the
freedman
case
means
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land
and
without
appeal,
then
this
body
itself
is
the
one
the
must
give
precedents
to
all
these
cases
because
this
is
the
final
bargain.
and
so
i
think
the
case
certainly
did
not
mean
that.
we
get
a
final
judgment
before
that
trial
court.
we
get
a
judgment
that
is
final
and
can
be
appealed
from.
and
that
is
a
judicial
determination.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
unconstitutional
to
require
the
movie
industry,
the
exhibitors,
as
such
to
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance
before
we
go
before
that
judicial
tribunal.
i
think
this
court
would
not
put
upon
us
the
burden
of
doing
a
vain
fame
because
the
movie
industry
itself
does
not
walk
the
default
judgment
before
the
court
which
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
says
they
tried
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
said
in
what?
in
the
freedman?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
the
freedman
case?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
it
maybe
filed
any
exhibitor
by
any
city.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
the
city.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
or
united
artist
--
the
ordinance
does
not
say
that
united
artist
might
do
so.
we
would
assume
that
since
they
have
a
financial
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
interest
in
the
picture
that
they
could
do
so,
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
oh,
yes.
we
would
accept
that
as
a
nonacceptance.
but
the
ordinance
doesn't
say
this,
does
it?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
ordinance
does
not
actually
say
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
does
not
say
it
cannot
because
the
only
mode
of
speech
from
--
with
united
artist
in
the
city
of
dallas
is
through
its
exhibitor
relationship.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
it
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
again
subject
to
judicial
review
if
a
subsequent
exhibitor
wants
to
show
the
same
film
and
without
the
classification,
he
may
again
submit
it
to
the
board
for
review
and
then
file
his
notice
of
nonacceptance
and
have
it
tried
by
the
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
same
exhibitor
may
do
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
fails
to
file
his
notice
of
nonacceptance
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
he
can
come
in
for
a
review.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
can
resubmit.
(voice
overlap)
he
has
given
that
right
under
the
ordinance,
if
he
so
desires.
we
have
tried
countless
things
with
every
precaution
possible
in
a
field
like
this.
now
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
goes
ahead
and
shows
the
picture
without
submitting
it
to
the
board,
then
under
our
view
of
the
case
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
under
the
law,
under
the
ordinance,
he
has
committed
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
shows
it
without
submitting
it,
that's
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
we
do
not
think
that's
censorship.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
no
we
don't
think
that's
censorship,
your
honor
(voice
overlap),
we
actually
--
actually,
this
was
the
same
question
that
was
in
the
times
film
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
as
long
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
allowable
censorship
maybe
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
so
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
saying
it's
not
censorship
it
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
illegal
abridgement,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
a
possible
abridgement,
yes
if
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir,
it
depends
if
the
words
of
the
consti
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i'll
say,
your
honor,
let's
assume
that
that
is
an
abridgement.
i'll
say
that
is
an
abridgement
of
this
sort.
but
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
constitution
is
actually
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
no.
not
in
that
sense,
sir.
whether
or
not
it
means
unfettered,
unlicensed
right
to
speak
at
any
times
under
any
circumstances
under
any
condition
and
say
what
one
thinks.
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
interpretation
that
has
been
put
upon
that
provision
of
the
constitution
down
through
the
years
that
there
have
been
some
abridgements
that
have
been
recognized
as
legal
ones,
as
such.
obscenity
itself
if
the
constitution
says
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
that
but
here
again
sir,
is
an
interpretation
and
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
is
another
interpretation
that
is
what
we're
talking
about.
so
we
say
that
there
are
some
circumstances
under
which
free
speech
in
some
condition
under
which
it
may
not
be
unfettered
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
there
are
nine
members
sir
and
i
believe
at
the
present
time,
there
are
there
alternate
members.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
appointed
by
the
city
council
and
they
are
required
to
have
certain
backgrounds
in
art
and
in
literature
and
in
philosophy
and
this
sort
of
thing
and
some
wide
range
of
backgrounds.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
removable,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
by
the
city
council
as
such
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
actually
worked.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
occupations
of
those
that
are
presently
serving
on
it
are
a
housewife,
a
preacher,
a
public
relations
man,
a
builder
in
construction,
a
real
estate
individual
--
one
that
is
versed
in
real
estate
matters
and
real
estate
business,
a
writer,
a
writer
and
interpreter,
and
the
generally
this
is
the
background
of
these
individuals.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
they
do
not
for
this
purpose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
this
purpose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
do
not
know
what
are
political
affiliations
are,
i've
never
heard
their
expressions,
because
actually
the
dallas
system
is
a
little
different
maybe
and
that
we
do
not
have
political
parties
insofar
as
city
council
is
concerned,
it's
nonpolitical
in
that
particular
respect.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
ins
and
outs,
that's
right
sir.
maybe
that's
political
in
the
sense,
but
that's
what
we
actually
have
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
without
pay,
sir.
without
pay
and
there's
quite
a
burden
on
them
because
when
the
movie
submitted,
it
must
be
done
within
the
time
limit
and
if
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
they
get
rather
tired
of
them
your
honor,
but
they
do,
and
they
take
their
own
time
and
they
actually
see
these
at
a
time
in
which
they
are
actually
available
to
them
and
made
so
by
the
industry.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
now
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
they
do
not
have.
the
industry
has
--
has
made
the
projection
room
available
to
them
and
told
them
at
what
times
it
will
be
available
and
they
make
themselves
available
at
that
time.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
local
theater
people,
yes
sir.
and
in
their
viewing
rooms,
they
have
viewing
rooms
in
dallas
in
which
they
view
movies
that
come
in
from
all
parts
of
united
states
for
the
exhibitors
themselves
to
view
to
see
whether
or
not
they
want
to
make
the
contracts
in
these
sorts
of
things.
so
this,
we
realize
is
not
in
every
city.
every
city
doesn't
have
these
exhibitors
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
the
movie
is
available
as
i
understand
it
that
the
industry
has
made
it
available
for
this
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
they
have
had
submitted
to
them
1900.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
1925
in
a
two-year-period.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
actually,
no
sir.
they
have
not.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
many
times
a
movie
is
submitted
as
classified
suitable
for
young
persons.
these
people
all
do
research
and
background.
they
get
all
of
the
information
they
can
from
the
writers
and
from
the
reviewers
throughout
the
country
and
submit
these
things,
and
then
they
consider
this.
and
if
there's
no
doubt
about
it
and
they
can
see
no
doubt
about
it
or
no
indication
of
it,
they
do
not
actually
view
the
movie
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir.
if
they're
going
to
classify
it
as
unsuitable,
it
must
either
be
because
the
industry
has
said
we
submitted
as
unsuitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
it
happened
in
565
out
of
604
cases.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
(voice
overlap)
well,
yes
that
is
correct
but
of
the
604
that
were
designated
not
suitable
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
604.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
understand
human
nature
very
well,
i
see
that
because
this
has
happened.
and
when
it
has
happened
they
have
then
gone
back
and
asked
the
board
to
view
the
movie
and
have
told
that
movie
industry,
they're
doing
it,
and
asked
them
to
come
in
and
actually
present
any
evidence
they
desire
to
do
so.
may
i
point
out
that
this
is
an
open
hearing
at
all
times.
the
press
is
always
present
when
they're
discussing
these
movies,
that
the
exhibitor
and
the
producer
or
anyone
else
is
requested
and
asked
to
come
in,
submit
any
evidence
they
want
to,
and
present
any
ideas
they
might
have
about
these
movies.
and
we
think
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
have
not
attempted
to
ask
the
exhibitor
to
delete
any
scene.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
so,
i'm
not
aware
of
it
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
unsuitable
in
the
terms
of
the
dallas
ordinance.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
do
not
object
to
it,
as
being
classified
that
way.
now,
i
realize
and
let
me
be
the
first
to
say
that
counsel
may
say,
well,
this
is
under
threat
and
i
realize
when
the
ordinance
said
there
is
some
possibility
of
that
and
there
would
not.
i
don't
think
these
many
would've
been
submitted
by
the
industry
itself
if
there
been
no
ordinance
search.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
or
if
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
and
so
--
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
it
shows
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
it's
more
than
this,
more
than
just
saying
we
don't
want
to
litigate.
i
think
that
actually
it's
also
saying
that
we
recognize
that
these
under
this
ordinance
are
not
suitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
beg
your
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
there's
still
profit
in
one
whether
it's
not
suitable
or
whether
it
is
suitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no.
no
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
way
it
works.
they
submit
it
as
not
suitable
and
say
we
request
permission
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
suitable
for
young
persons.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
and
in
the
case
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
we
have
complied
with
the
ordinance
so
far
as
this
movie
is
concerned,
and
in
that
case,
the
board
itself
does
not
actually
see
the
movie.
the
board
itself
does
not
actually
do
other
than
to
accept
the
classification
that's
put
on
it
by
the
movie
industry
itself.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
i
think
this
--
i
think
if
a
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
the
board
had
acted
on
it
which
they
do
in
those
cases
and
had
acted
on
it.
and
then
they
submitted
this
classification
and
then
they
did
allow
children
to
come
and
view
it
without
their
parent
or
guardian
or
husband
or
wife,
yes,
i
think
under
the
ordinance
they
could
be
prosecuted
in
the
corporation
courts,
with
the
fine
up
to
$200,
this
is
the
limits
of
the
penalty
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
say,
are
there
larger
ordinances?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
just
last
saturday
--
last
friday,
i
received
the
phone
call
that
told
me
that
this
was
a
fact.
i
do
not
know
it
to
be
so,
that
sometimes
this
brings
in
more
crowds
and
more
profit
than
without.
i
can't
--
i
can't
actually
substantiate
it
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
say
this
so,
i'd
say
that
the
social
opprobrium
referred
to
by
counsel
does
not
attach
to
a
label
such
as
this.
it
is
not
indirect
censorship
as
he
refers
to
in
that
particular
manner
and
i
would
cite
for
an
example,
if
i
might,
something
that's
well
known
to
all
of
us
and
that
is
the
bars
where
liquor
is
served
and
the
fact
that
young
people
are
not
admitted
to
those,
certainly
does
not
prevent
many
people
patronizing
those
bars.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
social
opprobrium
attached
to
this
thing.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
you're
right
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
has
been
repealed,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
now,
i
know
there's
been
a
lot
to
do
and
made
about
that
fact.
we
hope
that
in
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
and
in
the
actual
application
of
it
that
we're
doing
everything
we
can
to
make
it
a
sensible
one
and
actually
to
balance
if
you
will
in
whatever
sense
we
have
to
and
whatever
sense
we
need
to
the
right
to
protect
the
young
person.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
at
the
same
time
give
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
correct.
now,
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
only
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
only
for
the
exhibitor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
there
is
an
offense
to
the
individual
who
falsifies
his
age
or
who
fraudulently
--
fraudulently
attempts
to
get
in
and
does
get
in.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
then
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
boy
is
not
subject
to
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
exhibitor
subject
to
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no
offense
in
that
way.
we
in
fact
actually
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
there's
no
offense
in
that
particular
case
unless
he
falsifies
in
order
to
see
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
this
is
a
representation
of
a
sort,
yes
sir,
i
admit
that
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
such
that
--
it
could
--
if
he
could
be
proven
yes,
it
be
possible
but
actually
you
cannot
find
a
juvenile
of
this
kind
any
how
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
prosecutions.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
of
anybody.
the
--
i
would
like
to
state
to
this
court
that
attempting
to
comply
with
what
the
law
is
whether
we
like
it
or
not
that
all
parties
have
done
their
utmost
in
trying
to
get
the
thing
in
such
a
way
that
actually
we
could
present
it
as
a
law
question
and
that
we
could
finally
come
out
with
some
rules
and
guidelines
on
this
new
type
of
concept
and
it
is
a
little
bit
new.
under
which
we
can
operate,
protect
our
young
people
if
you
will,
but
at
the
same
time
grant
to
all
individuals
all
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
that
we
can
and
that
should
be
granted
to
them.
now,
this
is
not
an
easy
concept.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
we
have
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
books,
we
think
here
again
--
here
again
and
we
have
a
state
statute
on
it
so
therefore
we
could
not
even
if
we
so
desired.
the
city
could
not,
but
the
state
could.
but
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
it
because
we
think
this
goes
in
to
the
home
and
here
again
the
parent
has
the
right
to
take
care
of
his
own
child,
the
same
as
the
tv
movies
that
were
referred
a
minute
ago.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
this
reason
we
think,
your
honor,
and
right
or
wrong,
we
think
it
is
a
valid
concept
that
he
cannot
explain
to
his
child
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
or
the
difference
between
morality
and
immorality
or
sexual
promiscuity
and
smut
unless
he's
there
with
him.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
as
they
go
along,
your
honor.
not
as
they
go
along,
but
in
order
to
--
to
actually
fulfill
his
duty
as
a
parent,
we
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
required
and
we
do
not
want
to
impinge
on
that
right
of
the
parent
if
we
can
keep
from
doing
so
and
we
hope
that
it's
not
necessary
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
approximately
it
was
passed
first
in
april
of
1965,
there's
a
first
passage.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
it
did
not
go
to
referendum
and
it
was
not
necessary.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir
up
until
12
years
of
age,
i
believe,
it's
60
cents
or
some
such
thing
and
a
dollar-and-a-half
afterwards,
it
varies.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
associate
justices
of
this
court,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
misstatement
that
i
made
to
this
court
in
my
argument
this
morning.
on
page
126
of
the
record
in
the
ordinance,
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
young
person
to
enter
or
remain
in
the
viewing
room
of
any
theater
where
a
film
classified
not
suitable
for
young
person
is
being
exhibited.
i
misinformed
the
court,
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
actually
violating
the
ordinance
and
that's
all.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
the
only
punishment
that
can
be
given
to
a
person
of
that
age
is
to
turn
them
over
to
move
to
juvenile
authorities
actually.
you
cannot
fine
him.
you
cannot
put
him
in
jail.
really
there's
--
it's
like
many
of
our
other
juvenile
halls,
it's
rather
hard
to
enforce
actually.
it
would
only
be
one
of
a
number
of
things
that
would
have
to
be
proven
maybe
in
a
district
court
later
on
to
show
that
it
was
a
delinquent
or
that
maybe
he
was
not
properly
taken
care
of
by
his
parents
and
this
sort
of
thing.
but
this
is
about
all
you
could
do
in
a
case
like
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
same
and
similar
type
of
thing
and
that's
about
all
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
we
can
do,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
knowingly
permits
him,
that
is
correct
and
knowingly
is
a
hard
proposition
but
it
must
be
proven.
it
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
without
his
presence,
then
his
father
would
be
actually
the
one
that
would
be
prosecuted
in
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
up
to
$200-fine.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
imprisonment.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
does
apply
to
the
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
the
part
which
applies
to
the
father
would
apply
to
the
father
is
over
in
section
(c)
on
page
127.
it
would
be
a
case
in
which
he
gives
to
a
young
person
a
ticket
to
go
to
the
movie
or
purchase
it
for
him
and
take
it
or
some
such
thing
as
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
there
have
not,
your
honor.
the
one
thing
i
think
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
and
i
reiterate
to
the
court
is
the
fact
that
we
view
this
as
a
classification
ordinance
and
not
as
a
censorship
ordinance
because
there
is
no
restraint
on
the
content
of
speech
as
such.
the
only
restraint
is
on
the
audience
that
may
actually
view
this
content.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
i
understand
mr.
justice
black
it
does.
it
also
gives
a
right
of
choice
and
in
this
case,
no
individual
is
prohibited
from
seeing
it.
the
conditions
are
the
only
thing
--
their
conditions
are
the
only
thing.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
their
condition
is
right
to
see
it
under
certain
circumstances.
the
same
thing
as
we
do
when
we
talk
about
free
speech
in
a
parade.
a
parade
cannot
be
held
at
all
times
under
all
conditions
when
any
individual,
any
10,000
individuals
desire
to
hold
them
because
there
are
other
freedoms
and
there
are
other
rights
that
must
be
given
some
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
alright,
may
i
refer
to
the
movie
theater
if
i
might
as
this
court
has
referred
to
it
and
that's
hollering
fire
in
the
movie
theater
in
which
situation,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
not
unlimited
free
speech.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
speaking
when
he
wants
to
and
as
he
wants
to
and
under
the
conditions
(voice
overlap)
as
i
see
it
your
honor
and
it's
this
--
it's
this
reason,
i
say
it,
this
what
makes
hard
law
makes
it
tough
and
these
cases
are
not
easy,
if
they
were.
this
court
would
not
be
having
to
seat
on,
as
many
as
it
has
to,
at
this
particular
time.
but
this
is
a
time
in
history
when
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
this
type
of
law
to
see
whether
or
not
the
constitution
as
we
know
it
is
a
document
alive,
if
it
can
support
a
nation
that
not
only
has
a
past
but
must
have
a
future.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
mean
by
that
simply
this,
your
honor,
that
to
strictly
construe
and
without
any
fetters
whatsoever,
this
can
be
the
sort
upon
which
we
impale
ourselves
rather
than
the
sort
upon
which
we
fight
for
our
country.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
it
must
under
certain
circumstances
and
in
light
of
present
day
circumstances,
just
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
the
robel
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
if
we
had
any
instrument
that
was
not
subject
to
interpretation
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir,
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
--
i
think
that
if
and
this
is
a
personal
opinion
on
my
part,
i
think
that
if
this
is
an
instrument
that
has
no
latitude
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
no
latitude.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
your
honor,
i
say
if
it's
an
instrument
that
has
no
latitude.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
by
that
i
mean,
it
has
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you're
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
your
honor
if
it's
there
and
if
it's
there
in
unfettered
terms
like
that
then
i
have
a
right
to
disturb
any
meeting
i
want
to
at
any
time
and
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
under
the
freedom
of
speech,
if
it
were
an
untrammeled
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
then
under
freedom
of
speech
i'd
have
a
right
maybe
to
get
me
a
megaphone
and
stand
outside
and
speak
into
that
church
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
outside,
(voice
overlap)
i
say
you
do
not
have
that
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
think
i
do.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--this
court
thinks
i
do.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
i'm
saying
this
is
because
of
the
enlightened
interpretation
that's
been
put
on
the
words
in
the
constitution.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
maybe
i'm
not
communicating
properly
with
the
justice,
but
i
think
this
is
so,
yes.
you're
following
it
as
written
and
as
written
it
must
have
the
mind
of
men
applied
to
it.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
know.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
changed
it
and
i
don't
think
this
is
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
a
change
of
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
generally,
(voice
overlap),
it's
advisable
to
listen
mr.
chief
--
justice
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
do
have
a
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
do
have
a
right
to
listen
to
it,
that's
correct
because
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
everybody
has
a
right
to
look
at
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
an
unescorted
child
under
16,
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
neither
does
an
unescorted
child
under
16
have
a
right
to
make
many
other
choices.
your
honor,
may
i
cite
one
for
example.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
the
inoculations
given
to
the
children
at
school
even
though
it's
against
his
religion.
the
child
has
no
right
to
make
the
choice.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
parent
can't
even
make
that
choice,
your
honor.
so,
i'm
saying
that
that
are
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
it's
correct.
they
--
the
board
has
not
given
a
written
reason
as
to
why.
they
have
done
it
under
the
confines
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
yes
in
that
particular
situation,
the
same
as
--
as
when
a
court
quite
often
makes
a
decision
without
giving
all
of
the
reasons
for
it
and
none
of
our
district
courts
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
they
said
that
we
--
the
court
actually
said
that
he
thinks
we
were
entitled
to
an
injunction
on
the
law.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
board
itself
gave
no
written
reason.
and
the
only
reasons
given
were
those
that
were
given
in
the
court
by
two
members
of
the
board,
you're
correct
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
this
is
maybe
--
this
is
maybe
something
that
should
be
more
closely
drawn
as
you
actually
said
in
the
robel
case
when
you're
trying
to
decide
between
the
validities
of
the
two
things,
the
legislative
power
on
one
hand
and
the
individual
rights
on
the
other.
maybe
you
draw
a
narrow
line
and
maybe
this
is
one
of
the
lines
we
missed,
we
tried
not
to
but
it's
possible.
and
certainly
we
understand
the
intent
of
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
understand
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
mr.
chief
justice
question
at
length
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
oh!
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir,
i
think
there
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
thing
that
this
court
has
to
act
though
is
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
the
ordinance
itself
in
the
face
of
the
constitution
and
the
writings
of
this
court
that
they
have
every
opportunity
on
earth
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
the
ordinance
itself
is
valid
and
whether
it's
properly
drawn.
now,
as
to
its
application
to
this
particular
movie,
i
would
assume
that
this
court
as
it
has
in
some
other
situations
i
understand,
may
would
want
to
see
the
movie
itself
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
properly
applied
because
as
i
understand
it,
you
must
make
that
final
decision.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
there
are
findings
your
honor.
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
opinion,
the
court
was
very
explicit
in
saying
what
they
based
their
decision
on.
and
this
was
a
matter
that
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas.
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas
in
(inaudible)
would
simply
meant
that
they
didn't
agree
with
everything
but
they
thought
they
reached
a
right
conclusion
and
it
was
a
upon
--
it's
on
this
record
that
it
comes
to
this
court
then
and
the
final
arbiter
as
to
whether
or
not
this
movie
meets
the
standards.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
from
a
standard
in
the
ordinance
if
the
court
finds
it
as
a
constitutional
standard
which
we
think
it
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
think
it
is
a
complete
obscenity
question
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
courts
were
remised
in
this
respect
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
it
--
and
i
think
--
what
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
do
have.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
derived
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
would
get
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
hope
the
court
would
do
what
it
has
indicated
and
maybe
on
one
occasion
and
that
is
that
that
material
that
is
harmful
to
children
or
that
can
create
problems
with
children
maybe
ought
to
be
included
in
the
definition
of
obscenity.
if
this
is
what
you're
talking
about
then
i'm
--
i
certainly
can
agree
with
the
court
if
we're
talking
about
a
definition
similar
to
obscenity
for
adults
and
with
all
of
the
requirements
that
it
has
there,
i
think
it
will
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
meet
the
end
that
it
must
meet.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
what
we're
referring
to
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
that
they
are
not
truly
relevant
to
this
problem
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
to
the
thing
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
this
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
we
have
attempted
to
establish
a
test
in
the
ordinance
whether
or
not
it's
constitutional
is
of
course
a
question
that
is
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
now
being
presented.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
to
determine
what
the
test
should
be,
we're
trying
to
apply
of
the
law
we
can
muster
to
try
to
arrive
at
this
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
the
only
thing
we
been
able
to
muster
at
this
point
are
the
indications
by
this
court
that
this
is
a
special
problem
and
a
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
and
that
is
the
protection
of
its
young
people.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
then
in
the
context
--
yes,
in
the
context
of
the
obscenity
cases
for
adults,
then
we've
tried
to
adapt
it
over
as
best
as
we
can
and
without
going
too
far
we
hope
in
this
respect.
now,
to
do
that
is
just
as
hard
as
it
is
to
define
obscenity
as
such
and
to
determine
what
is
obscenity?
we
know
this
and
for
that
reason
maybe
inaptly
sometimes
we
have
expressed
it.
i
cannot
answer
with
certain
definiteness
the
mr.
chief
justice's
question
because
i'm
not
sure
that
it
can
be
answered
as
a
definite
factor.
i
hope
that
we
can
get
guidelines
in
which
we
can
reach
more
definiteness.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
are
--
we're
hoping
that
we
had
properly
interpreted.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
what
this
court
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
jacobellis,
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
we're
trying
to
move
it
from
the
obscenity
for
adults
over
to
the
protection
of
children
without
doing
violence
to
the
first
amendment
as
best
we
can.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
we've
talked
about
obscenity
here
and
if
we're
talking
about
obscenity
as
it
can
be
defined
so
far
as
it
concerns
children
and
we
think
that
this
is
generally
what
we've
done
in
this
ordinance
then
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
of
exhibition
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
to
those
below
the
age
of
16
years.
this
was
the
same
thing
that
mr.
justice
hughes
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
in
new
orleans
said
the
due
obscenity
rules
if
applied
to
this
statute
would
be
proper.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
associate
justices,
may
i
address
myself
to
the
latest
question
that
was
just
raised.
this
is
about
the
right
of
the
parent
and
the
right
of
children.
this
ordinance
does
provide,
as
we
read
it
and
as
we
interpret
it
and
as
the
city
council
passed,
that
a
parent,
a
guardian,
a
husband,
or
wife
may
take
a
child
or
a
young
person
below
the
age
of
16
years
to
a
movie
that
is
designated
as
not
acceptable
for
young
persons.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
provides
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
mr.
nizer
stated
yesterday
that
in
his
opinion
they
did
have
that
right
maybe
to
prohibit
any
of
them
from
going
any
used
as
an
example
of
pool
halls
which
he
likened
to
the
right
of
assembly
and
he
said
you
could
prevent
young
persons
from
assembling
in
a
pool
hall.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
he
said
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
you
could
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
pick
and
choose,
this
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
alright,
yes,
and
i
--
this
is
what
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to.he
said
but
he
likened
it
to
the
pool
halls
but
he
said
that
he
would
not
accept
the
pool
hall
analogy
because
of
the
fact
that
this
was
based
upon
safety
of
the
young
person.
now,
it
is
with
this
argument
that
i
would
take
disagreement
because
of
the
fact
that
preventing
young
persons
from
going
in
a
pool
hall
is
not
a
safety
provision.
there
is
no
danger
of
falling
off
a
pool
table
or
being
injured
in
the
pool
hall.
it's
the
immorality
that
this
is
actually
directed
to
because
the
ymca's
have
pools
in
many
cities
and
allow
individuals
to
play
young
persons,
to
participate
but
under
certain
conditions.
now,
insofar
as
that
applies
here
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
pick
and
choose,
we
think
that
actually
it
would
be
more
unconstitutional
not
to
pick
and
choose
and
it
would
to
pick
and
choose
for
this
simple
reason,
to
prevent
young
persons
under
the
age
of
16
years
from
attending
any
movie
would
be
the
most
blatant
sort
of
the
restriction
on
the
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
have
seen
the
picture,
yes
sir
on
two
or
three
different
occasions.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
marshall,
let
me
say
this
about
this
picture,
it
is
a
marginal
picture.
i
must
admit
this
to
this
court
and
i'll
be
very
frank
in
this
respect.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
as
was
pointed
out
by
reverend
masio
(ph)
and
i
agree
with
him
in
this
respect,
it
depicts
sexual
promiscuity
in
this
manner.
it
shows
a
woman
who
goes
and
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
meets
three
men
for
the
first
time
in
an
evening
and
goes
and
has
an
evening
with
them
on
all
evening
escapade
which
is
not
shown,
comes
back
in
the
morning
with
their
closed
pool
half
way
off
and
they
shout.
and
she
comes
back
and
she
says,
“this
is
the
life
or
this
is
the
fun
i
have
been
missing”.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
maybe
--
for
some
maybe
it's
not
wrong,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir.
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
implanting
in
the
minds
of
the
young
people
the
thought
to
see
the
play
that
immorality
of
this
sort
--
of
this
kind
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
is
fun
and
the
highest
form
of
life.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
and
desirable,
and
useful.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
say
it
is
marginal,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
prefer
not
to
apply
them
the
marginal
situation.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
that
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
and
this
is
the
reason
i
hope
to
answer
very
carefully
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
on
this.
it
is
hard
to
determine
sometimes
and
i
think
in
cases
of
doubt
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
was
an
eight
to
one
decision.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
marginal
situations
are
the
ones
that
make
lawsuits
and
that's
the
reason
we're
before
this
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
exactly
right
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
not
censors
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
as
we
refer
to
them
your
honor
but
members
of
the
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
would
actually
do
so.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
would
not
ban
it
sir.
it
would
not
prohibit
it.
it
merely
requires
a
label
in
the
advertising.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mu
anwer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
we
do
not
prohibit
anything.
we
merely
say,
let's
have
it's
somewhat
near
the
truth
in
advertising
sort
of
situation,
it's
somewhat
near
the
situation
of
pick
and
choose
if
you
will
but
give
them
something
from
which
to
pick
and
choose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
may
a
city
attorney
and
may
i
answer
you
sir
in
an
example
which
is
a
true
example
on
the
occasions
in
which
i
have
before
this
board
actually
fought
with
them
and
told
them
what
this
court
has
held
and
what
we
think
because
of
marginal
situations
they
could
not
do
and
should
not
do
and
they
have
agreed
to
that
and
they
have
many
instances,
done
things
they
did
not
want
to
do.
personally,
they
disagreed
with
for
this
reason
and
we
take
this
thing
very
seriously
and
for
that
reason
we
have
attempted,
it
is
true,
we've
got
a
situation
here
that
may
make
some
bad
law
because
it
is
the
marginal
case.
but
we
have
attempted
to
counsel
with
the
board
and
to
work
with
them
as
officers
of
the
court
and
attempt
to
protect
these
first
amendment
freedoms
as
best
as
we
can
but
at
the
same
time
giving
to
the
state
the
right
to
protect
its
young
persons,
if
we
can
do
that.
and
we
think
that
maybe
this
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
no,
because
there
are
only
a
very
few
scenes
in
the
whole
picture.
another
one
of
the
scenes
that
i
did
not
described,
your
honor,
was
one
that
occurred
inside
the
--
inside
the
jail
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
one
or
two
more.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
says
in
whole
taken
as
a
whole,
using
the
test
that
has
been
set
out
by
this
court,
that
it
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
would
not
think
it
was
marginal
if
it
--
if
this
was
the
whole
theme
of
the
movie
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
it
--
it
may
--
the
standards
are
hard
to
apply
as
the
obscenity
standard
is
hard
to
apply,
none
of
these
are
easy
as
counsel
admit
--
and
if
they're
hard
to
draw,
they're
hard
to
define,
and
for
this
reason
it
does
make
for
a
hard
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice,
if
you
say
thoroughly,
the
kind
of
thing
it
was
entitled
to
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
it
were
not
marginal
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
the
scene
by
itself
is
not.
the
movie
as
a
whole
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
the
board
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
they
did
not.
they
did
not.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
they
do
not
write
down
the
reasons
for
which
they
do
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
which
they
actually
did
it?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
before
this
court
will
be
confronted
with
that
situation
it
must
be
proven
before
a
judicial
body.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
the
decision
will
have
to
be
made
there.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
can
advise
you,
but
this
is
the
only
way.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
it
would
be
hearsay.
it
would
be
hearsay.
and
i
say
for
that
reason
it's
not
in
the
record
and
it
does
not
show.
but
this
is
the
immaterial
to
a
situation
like
this
because
of
the
fact
that
judge
has
to
make
a
decision
on
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
gave
no
reasons
at
that
particular
time.
no
he
did
not
accept
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
judge
came
in
from
an
outlying
county.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
that's
not
quite
it,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
(voice
overlap)
he
refused
to
make
findings
of
fact
as
such
and
he
did
not
make
them.
he
did
view
the
movie.
he
did
listen
to
the
testimony.
he
did
listen
to
argument
of
counsel
and
he
did
then
make
a
decision
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
had
the
standards
of
a
statute,
he
had
briefs
of
counsel,
he
had
all
of
the
consideration
that
counsel
could
give
him
and
all
of
the
advice
and
the
argument
that
either
of
us
could
give
to
him
at
that
time.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
exactly
what
he
said
your
honor.
but
we
had
been
arguing
with
him
for
quite
some
time
before
he
said
this,
and
had
been
presenting
ideas
back
and
forth
very
freely.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
he
was.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
he
tried
to
follow
the
law
as
best
he
could
understand
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
not
really
sure
of
what
the
understanding
is
when
we
get
in
these
nebulous
fields,
they're
hard,
and
they
are
difficult.
and
so
we
are
all
trying
to
approach
that
thing
which
gives
the
rights
of
both
parties
proper
precedent.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
between
january
14th
of
1966
and
january
10th
of
1968,
there
were
1925
movies
submitted
to
the
board.
of
that
number,
565
of
them
were
classified
as
not
suitable
by
the
exhibitor
himself.
he
asked
for
that
classification
to
be
put
on.
39
were
classified
as
not
suitable
after
screening
by
the
board
itself
and
of
the
movies
classified
suitable,
1226
of
them
were
classified
suitable
as
submitted
by
the
exhibitor
and
59
of
them
were
classified
suitable
after
screening
by
the
committee
and
by
the
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
those
figures
are
not
in
the
brief
sir.
those
figures
are
just
of
recent
vantage.
they
--
actually
we
got
those
on
january
10th,
1968.
we
would
like
to
submit
them
to
the
court
for
their
consideration
in
the
record.
thank
you.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
black,
i'd
hate
to
speculate
with
you
on
that
particular
statement,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
the
first
time
we've
ever
had
an
ordinance
similar
to
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
as
to
this.
we
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
discussed
very
frankly
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sure.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
sir.
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
may
i
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
black.
i
could
no
more
predict
than
i
could
predict
without
benefit
of
counsel
how
much
smut
and
other
type
of
things
would
be
introduced
into
our
system
because
it's
a
two-way
proposition.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
there
would've
been
more
sir,
it's
possible.
insofar
as
the
speedy
remedy
is
concerned
and
the
final
judicial
determination
is
concerned
which
was
being
discussed
just
a
minute
ago,
i'd
like
to
discuss
it
in
a
minute.
in
these
words,
a
careful
reading
of
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
dallas
will
i
think
convince
this
court
of
the
very
onerous
burden
that
the
city
accepted
upon
itself
in
order
that
it
might
provide
every
remedy
known
and
every
opportunity
for
a
speedy
trial
and
speedy
judicial
determination.
now,
if
final
judicial
determination
as
used
in
the
freedman
case
means
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land
and
without
appeal,
then
this
body
itself
is
the
one
the
must
give
precedents
to
all
these
cases
because
this
is
the
final
bargain.
and
so
i
think
the
case
certainly
did
not
mean
that.
we
get
a
final
judgment
before
that
trial
court.
we
get
a
judgment
that
is
final
and
can
be
appealed
from.
and
that
is
a
judicial
determination.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
unconstitutional
to
require
the
movie
industry,
the
exhibitors,
as
such
to
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance
before
we
go
before
that
judicial
tribunal.
i
think
this
court
would
not
put
upon
us
the
burden
of
doing
a
vain
fame
because
the
movie
industry
itself
does
not
walk
the
default
judgment
before
the
court
which
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
says
they
tried
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
said
in
what?
in
the
freedman?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
the
freedman
case?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
it
maybe
filed
any
exhibitor
by
any
city.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
the
city.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
or
united
artist
--
the
ordinance
does
not
say
that
united
artist
might
do
so.
we
would
assume
that
since
they
have
a
financial
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
interest
in
the
picture
that
they
could
do
so,
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
oh,
yes.
we
would
accept
that
as
a
nonacceptance.
but
the
ordinance
doesn't
say
this,
does
it?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
ordinance
does
not
actually
say
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
does
not
say
it
cannot
because
the
only
mode
of
speech
from
--
with
united
artist
in
the
city
of
dallas
is
through
its
exhibitor
relationship.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
classification
board.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
it
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
again
subject
to
judicial
review
if
a
subsequent
exhibitor
wants
to
show
the
same
film
and
without
the
classification,
he
may
again
submit
it
to
the
board
for
review
and
then
file
his
notice
of
nonacceptance
and
have
it
tried
by
the
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
same
exhibitor
may
do
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
fails
to
file
his
notice
of
nonacceptance
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
he
can
come
in
for
a
review.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
can
resubmit.
(voice
overlap)
he
has
given
that
right
under
the
ordinance,
if
he
so
desires.
we
have
tried
countless
things
with
every
precaution
possible
in
a
field
like
this.
now
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
goes
ahead
and
shows
the
picture
without
submitting
it
to
the
board,
then
under
our
view
of
the
case
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
under
the
law,
under
the
ordinance,
he
has
committed
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
he
shows
it
without
submitting
it,
that's
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
we
do
not
think
that's
censorship.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
no
we
don't
think
that's
censorship,
your
honor
(voice
overlap),
we
actually
--
actually,
this
was
the
same
question
that
was
in
the
times
film
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
as
long
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
allowable
censorship
maybe
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
so
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
saying
it's
not
censorship
it
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
illegal
abridgement,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it
is
a
possible
abridgement,
yes
if
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir,
it
depends
if
the
words
of
the
consti
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i'll
say,
your
honor,
let's
assume
that
that
is
an
abridgement.
i'll
say
that
is
an
abridgement
of
this
sort.
but
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
constitution
is
actually
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
no.
not
in
that
sense,
sir.
whether
or
not
it
means
unfettered,
unlicensed
right
to
speak
at
any
times
under
any
circumstances
under
any
condition
and
say
what
one
thinks.
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
interpretation
that
has
been
put
upon
that
provision
of
the
constitution
down
through
the
years
that
there
have
been
some
abridgements
that
have
been
recognized
as
legal
ones,
as
such.
obscenity
itself
if
the
constitution
says
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand
that
but
here
again
sir,
is
an
interpretation
and
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
is
another
interpretation
that
is
what
we're
talking
about.
so
we
say
that
there
are
some
circumstances
under
which
free
speech
in
some
condition
under
which
it
may
not
be
unfettered
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
there
are
nine
members
sir
and
i
believe
at
the
present
time,
there
are
there
alternate
members.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
appointed
by
the
city
council
and
they
are
required
to
have
certain
backgrounds
in
art
and
in
literature
and
in
philosophy
and
this
sort
of
thing
and
some
wide
range
of
backgrounds.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
are
removable,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
by
the
city
council
as
such
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
actually
worked.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
occupations
of
those
that
are
presently
serving
on
it
are
a
housewife,
a
preacher,
a
public
relations
man,
a
builder
in
construction,
a
real
estate
individual
--
one
that
is
versed
in
real
estate
matters
and
real
estate
business,
a
writer,
a
writer
and
interpreter,
and
the
generally
this
is
the
background
of
these
individuals.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
they
do
not
for
this
purpose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
this
purpose.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
do
not
know
what
are
political
affiliations
are,
i've
never
heard
their
expressions,
because
actually
the
dallas
system
is
a
little
different
maybe
and
that
we
do
not
have
political
parties
insofar
as
city
council
is
concerned,
it's
nonpolitical
in
that
particular
respect.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
ins
and
outs,
that's
right
sir.
maybe
that's
political
in
the
sense,
but
that's
what
we
actually
have
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
without
pay,
sir.
without
pay
and
there's
quite
a
burden
on
them
because
when
the
movie
submitted,
it
must
be
done
within
the
time
limit
and
if
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
they
get
rather
tired
of
them
your
honor,
but
they
do,
and
they
take
their
own
time
and
they
actually
see
these
at
a
time
in
which
they
are
actually
available
to
them
and
made
so
by
the
industry.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
now
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
they
do
not
have.
the
industry
has
--
has
made
the
projection
room
available
to
them
and
told
them
at
what
times
it
will
be
available
and
they
make
themselves
available
at
that
time.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
local
theater
people,
yes
sir.
and
in
their
viewing
rooms,
they
have
viewing
rooms
in
dallas
in
which
they
view
movies
that
come
in
from
all
parts
of
united
states
for
the
exhibitors
themselves
to
view
to
see
whether
or
not
they
want
to
make
the
contracts
in
these
sorts
of
things.
so
this,
we
realize
is
not
in
every
city.
every
city
doesn't
have
these
exhibitors
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
the
movie
is
available
as
i
understand
it
that
the
industry
has
made
it
available
for
this
court.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
they
have
had
submitted
to
them
1900.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
1925
in
a
two-year-period.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
actually,
no
sir.
they
have
not.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
many
times
a
movie
is
submitted
as
classified
suitable
for
young
persons.
these
people
all
do
research
and
background.
they
get
all
of
the
information
they
can
from
the
writers
and
from
the
reviewers
throughout
the
country
and
submit
these
things,
and
then
they
consider
this.
and
if
there's
no
doubt
about
it
and
they
can
see
no
doubt
about
it
or
no
indication
of
it,
they
do
not
actually
view
the
movie
as
such.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir.
if
they're
going
to
classify
it
as
unsuitable,
it
must
either
be
because
the
industry
has
said
we
submitted
as
unsuitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
it
happened
in
565
out
of
604
cases.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
(voice
overlap)
well,
yes
that
is
correct
but
of
the
604
that
were
designated
not
suitable
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
604.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
understand
human
nature
very
well,
i
see
that
because
this
has
happened.
and
when
it
has
happened
they
have
then
gone
back
and
asked
the
board
to
view
the
movie
and
have
told
that
movie
industry,
they're
doing
it,
and
asked
them
to
come
in
and
actually
present
any
evidence
they
desire
to
do
so.
may
i
point
out
that
this
is
an
open
hearing
at
all
times.
the
press
is
always
present
when
they're
discussing
these
movies,
that
the
exhibitor
and
the
producer
or
anyone
else
is
requested
and
asked
to
come
in,
submit
any
evidence
they
want
to,
and
present
any
ideas
they
might
have
about
these
movies.
and
we
think
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
have
not
attempted
to
ask
the
exhibitor
to
delete
any
scene.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
if
so,
i'm
not
aware
of
it
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
unsuitable
in
the
terms
of
the
dallas
ordinance.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
they
do
not
object
to
it,
as
being
classified
that
way.
now,
i
realize
and
let
me
be
the
first
to
say
that
counsel
may
say,
well,
this
is
under
threat
and
i
realize
when
the
ordinance
said
there
is
some
possibility
of
that
and
there
would
not.
i
don't
think
these
many
would've
been
submitted
by
the
industry
itself
if
there
been
no
ordinance
search.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
or
if
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
and
so
--
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
it
shows
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
it's
more
than
this,
more
than
just
saying
we
don't
want
to
litigate.
i
think
that
actually
it's
also
saying
that
we
recognize
that
these
under
this
ordinance
are
not
suitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
beg
your
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
there's
still
profit
in
one
whether
it's
not
suitable
or
whether
it
is
suitable.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no.
no
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
way
it
works.
they
submit
it
as
not
suitable
and
say
we
request
permission
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
suitable
for
young
persons.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
and
in
the
case
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
we
have
complied
with
the
ordinance
so
far
as
this
movie
is
concerned,
and
in
that
case,
the
board
itself
does
not
actually
see
the
movie.
the
board
itself
does
not
actually
do
other
than
to
accept
the
classification
that's
put
on
it
by
the
movie
industry
itself.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
i
think
this
--
i
think
if
a
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
the
board
had
acted
on
it
which
they
do
in
those
cases
and
had
acted
on
it.
and
then
they
submitted
this
classification
and
then
they
did
allow
children
to
come
and
view
it
without
their
parent
or
guardian
or
husband
or
wife,
yes,
i
think
under
the
ordinance
they
could
be
prosecuted
in
the
corporation
courts,
with
the
fine
up
to
$200,
this
is
the
limits
of
the
penalty
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
say,
are
there
larger
ordinances?
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
just
last
saturday
--
last
friday,
i
received
the
phone
call
that
told
me
that
this
was
a
fact.
i
do
not
know
it
to
be
so,
that
sometimes
this
brings
in
more
crowds
and
more
profit
than
without.
i
can't
--
i
can't
actually
substantiate
it
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
say
this
so,
i'd
say
that
the
social
opprobrium
referred
to
by
counsel
does
not
attach
to
a
label
such
as
this.
it
is
not
indirect
censorship
as
he
refers
to
in
that
particular
manner
and
i
would
cite
for
an
example,
if
i
might,
something
that's
well
known
to
all
of
us
and
that
is
the
bars
where
liquor
is
served
and
the
fact
that
young
people
are
not
admitted
to
those,
certainly
does
not
prevent
many
people
patronizing
those
bars.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
social
opprobrium
attached
to
this
thing.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
you're
right
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
has
been
repealed,
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
now,
i
know
there's
been
a
lot
to
do
and
made
about
that
fact.
we
hope
that
in
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
and
in
the
actual
application
of
it
that
we're
doing
everything
we
can
to
make
it
a
sensible
one
and
actually
to
balance
if
you
will
in
whatever
sense
we
have
to
and
whatever
sense
we
need
to
the
right
to
protect
the
young
person.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
at
the
same
time
give
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
correct.
now,
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
only
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
only
for
the
exhibitor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
there
is
an
offense
to
the
individual
who
falsifies
his
age
or
who
fraudulently
--
fraudulently
attempts
to
get
in
and
does
get
in.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
then
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
boy
is
not
subject
to
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
exhibitor
subject
to
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
no
offense
in
that
way.
we
in
fact
actually
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
there's
no
offense
in
that
particular
case
unless
he
falsifies
in
order
to
see
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
this
is
a
representation
of
a
sort,
yes
sir,
i
admit
that
but
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
such
that
--
it
could
--
if
he
could
be
proven
yes,
it
be
possible
but
actually
you
cannot
find
a
juvenile
of
this
kind
any
how
(voice

--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
prosecutions.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
of
anybody.
the
--
i
would
like
to
state
to
this
court
that
attempting
to
comply
with
what
the
law
is
whether
we
like
it
or
not
that
all
parties
have
done
their
utmost
in
trying
to
get
the
thing
in
such
a
way
that
actually
we
could
present
it
as
a
law
question
and
that
we
could
finally
come
out
with
some
rules
and
guidelines
on
this
new
type
of
concept
and
it
is
a
little
bit
new.
under
which
we
can
operate,
protect
our
young
people
if
you
will,
but
at
the
same
time
grant
to
all
individuals
all
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
that
we
can
and
that
should
be
granted
to
them.
now,
this
is
not
an
easy
concept.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
sir,
we
have
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
books,
we
think
here
again
--
here
again
and
we
have
a
state
statute
on
it
so
therefore
we
could
not
even
if
we
so
desired.
the
city
could
not,
but
the
state
could.
but
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
it
because
we
think
this
goes
in
to
the
home
and
here
again
the
parent
has
the
right
to
take
care
of
his
own
child,
the
same
as
the
tv
movies
that
were
referred
a
minute
ago.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
for
this
reason
we
think,
your
honor,
and
right
or
wrong,
we
think
it
is
a
valid
concept
that
he
cannot
explain
to
his
child
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
or
the
difference
between
morality
and
immorality
or
sexual
promiscuity
and
smut
unless
he's
there
with
him.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
as
they
go
along,
your
honor.
not
as
they
go
along,
but
in
order
to
--
to
actually
fulfill
his
duty
as
a
parent,
we
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
required
and
we
do
not
want
to
impinge
on
that
right
of
the
parent
if
we
can
keep
from
doing
so
and
we
hope
that
it's
not
necessary
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
approximately
it
was
passed
first
in
april
of
1965,
there's
a
first
passage.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
it
did
not
go
to
referendum
and
it
was
not
necessary.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
sir
up
until
12
years
of
age,
i
believe,
it's
60
cents
or
some
such
thing
and
a
dollar-and-a-half
afterwards,
it
varies.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
associate
justices
of
this
court,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
misstatement
that
i
made
to
this
court
in
my
argument
this
morning.
on
page
126
of
the
record
in
the
ordinance,
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
young
person
to
enter
or
remain
in
the
viewing
room
of
any
theater
where
a
film
classified
not
suitable
for
young
person
is
being
exhibited.
i
misinformed
the
court,
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
actually
violating
the
ordinance
and
that's
all.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
the
only
punishment
that
can
be
given
to
a
person
of
that
age
is
to
turn
them
over
to
move
to
juvenile
authorities
actually.
you
cannot
fine
him.
you
cannot
put
him
in
jail.
really
there's
--
it's
like
many
of
our
other
juvenile
halls,
it's
rather
hard
to
enforce
actually.
it
would
only
be
one
of
a
number
of
things
that
would
have
to
be
proven
maybe
in
a
district
court
later
on
to
show
that
it
was
a
delinquent
or
that
maybe
he
was
not
properly
taken
care
of
by
his
parents
and
this
sort
of
thing.
but
this
is
about
all
you
could
do
in
a
case
like
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
same
and
similar
type
of
thing
and
that's
about
all
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
we
can
do,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
knowingly
permits
him,
that
is
correct
and
knowingly
is
a
hard
proposition
but
it
must
be
proven.
it
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
without
his
presence,
then
his
father
would
be
actually
the
one
that
would
be
prosecuted
in
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
up
to
$200-fine.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
imprisonment.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
does
apply
to
the
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
the
part
which
applies
to
the
father
would
apply
to
the
father
is
over
in
section
(c)
on
page
127.
it
would
be
a
case
in
which
he
gives
to
a
young
person
a
ticket
to
go
to
the
movie
or
purchase
it
for
him
and
take
it
or
some
such
thing
as
this.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
there
have
not,
your
honor.
the
one
thing
i
think
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
and
i
reiterate
to
the
court
is
the
fact
that
we
view
this
as
a
classification
ordinance
and
not
as
a
censorship
ordinance
because
there
is
no
restraint
on
the
content
of
speech
as
such.
the
only
restraint
is
on
the
audience
that
may
actually
view
this
content.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
i
understand
mr.
justice
black
it
does.
it
also
gives
a
right
of
choice
and
in
this
case,
no
individual
is
prohibited
from
seeing
it.
the
conditions
are
the
only
thing
--
their
conditions
are
the
only
thing.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
their
condition
is
right
to
see
it
under
certain
circumstances.
the
same
thing
as
we
do
when
we
talk
about
free
speech
in
a
parade.
a
parade
cannot
be
held
at
all
times
under
all
conditions
when
any
individual,
any
10,000
individuals
desire
to
hold
them
because
there
are
other
freedoms
and
there
are
other
rights
that
must
be
given
some
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
alright,
may
i
refer
to
the
movie
theater
if
i
might
as
this
court
has
referred
to
it
and
that's
hollering
fire
in
the
movie
theater
in
which
situation,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
not
unlimited
free
speech.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
speaking
when
he
wants
to
and
as
he
wants
to
and
under
the
conditions
(voice
overlap)
as
i
see
it
your
honor
and
it's
this
--
it's
this
reason,
i
say
it,
this
what
makes
hard
law
makes
it
tough
and
these
cases
are
not
easy,
if
they
were.
this
court
would
not
be
having
to
seat
on,
as
many
as
it
has
to,
at
this
particular
time.
but
this
is
a
time
in
history
when
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
this
type
of
law
to
see
whether
or
not
the
constitution
as
we
know
it
is
a
document
alive,
if
it
can
support
a
nation
that
not
only
has
a
past
but
must
have
a
future.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
mean
by
that
simply
this,
your
honor,
that
to
strictly
construe
and
without
any
fetters
whatsoever,
this
can
be
the
sort
upon
which
we
impale
ourselves
rather
than
the
sort
upon
which
we
fight
for
our
country.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
it
must
under
certain
circumstances
and
in
light
of
present
day
circumstances,
just
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
the
robel
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
if
we
had
any
instrument
that
was
not
subject
to
interpretation
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir,
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
--
i
think
that
if
and
this
is
a
personal
opinion
on
my
part,
i
think
that
if
this
is
an
instrument
that
has
no
latitude
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
no
latitude.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no
your
honor,
i
say
if
it's
an
instrument
that
has
no
latitude.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
by
that
i
mean,
it
has
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you're
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
your
honor
if
it's
there
and
if
it's
there
in
unfettered
terms
like
that
then
i
have
a
right
to
disturb
any
meeting
i
want
to
at
any
time
and
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor
under
the
freedom
of
speech,
if
it
were
an
untrammeled
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
your
honor,
then
under
freedom
of
speech
i'd
have
a
right
maybe
to
get
me
a
megaphone
and
stand
outside
and
speak
into
that
church
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
outside,
(voice
overlap)
i
say
you
do
not
have
that
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
think
i
do.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--this
court
thinks
i
do.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
but
i'm
saying
this
is
because
of
the
enlightened
interpretation
that's
been
put
on
the
words
in
the
constitution.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
i
think
maybe
i'm
not
communicating
properly
with
the
justice,
but
i
think
this
is
so,
yes.
you're
following
it
as
written
and
as
written
it
must
have
the
mind
of
men
applied
to
it.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
know.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
changed
it
and
i
don't
think
this
is
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
a
change
of
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
generally,
(voice
overlap),
it's
advisable
to
listen
mr.
chief
--
justice
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
do
have
a
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
you
do
have
a
right
to
listen
to
it,
that's
correct
because
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
everybody
has
a
right
to
look
at
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
not
an
unescorted
child
under
16,
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
neither
does
an
unescorted
child
under
16
have
a
right
to
make
many
other
choices.
your
honor,
may
i
cite
one
for
example.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
the
inoculations
given
to
the
children
at
school
even
though
it's
against
his
religion.
the
child
has
no
right
to
make
the
choice.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
parent
can't
even
make
that
choice,
your
honor.
so,
i'm
saying
that
that
are
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
it's
correct.
they
--
the
board
has
not
given
a
written
reason
as
to
why.
they
have
done
it
under
the
confines
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
yes
in
that
particular
situation,
the
same
as
--
as
when
a
court
quite
often
makes
a
decision
without
giving
all
of
the
reasons
for
it
and
none
of
our
district
courts
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
right.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
they
said
that
we
--
the
court
actually
said
that
he
thinks
we
were
entitled
to
an
injunction
on
the
law.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
the
board
itself
gave
no
written
reason.
and
the
only
reasons
given
were
those
that
were
given
in
the
court
by
two
members
of
the
board,
you're
correct
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
this
is
maybe
--
this
is
maybe
something
that
should
be
more
closely
drawn
as
you
actually
said
in
the
robel
case
when
you're
trying
to
decide
between
the
validities
of
the
two
things,
the
legislative
power
on
one
hand
and
the
individual
rights
on
the
other.
maybe
you
draw
a
narrow
line
and
maybe
this
is
one
of
the
lines
we
missed,
we
tried
not
to
but
it's
possible.
and
certainly
we
understand
the
intent
of
it.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
understand
the
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
mr.
chief
justice
question
at
length
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
oh!
yes
sir.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes
sir,
i
think
there
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
thing
that
this
court
has
to
act
though
is
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
the
ordinance
itself
in
the
face
of
the
constitution
and
the
writings
of
this
court
that
they
have
every
opportunity
on
earth
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
the
ordinance
itself
is
valid
and
whether
it's
properly
drawn.
now,
as
to
its
application
to
this
particular
movie,
i
would
assume
that
this
court
as
it
has
in
some
other
situations
i
understand,
may
would
want
to
see
the
movie
itself
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
properly
applied
because
as
i
understand
it,
you
must
make
that
final
decision.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
there
are
findings
your
honor.
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
opinion,
the
court
was
very
explicit
in
saying
what
they
based
their
decision
on.
and
this
was
a
matter
that
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas.
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas
in
(inaudible)
would
simply
meant
that
they
didn't
agree
with
everything
but
they
thought
they
reached
a
right
conclusion
and
it
was
a
upon
--
it's
on
this
record
that
it
comes
to
this
court
then
and
the
final
arbiter
as
to
whether
or
not
this
movie
meets
the
standards.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
from
a
standard
in
the
ordinance
if
the
court
finds
it
as
a
constitutional
standard
which
we
think
it
is.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
don't
think
it
is
a
complete
obscenity
question
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
think
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
no.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
it's
possible
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
courts
were
remised
in
this
respect
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
it
--
and
i
think
--
what
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
do
have.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
derived
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
i
would
get
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
hope
the
court
would
do
what
it
has
indicated
and
maybe
on
one
occasion
and
that
is
that
that
material
that
is
harmful
to
children
or
that
can
create
problems
with
children
maybe
ought
to
be
included
in
the
definition
of
obscenity.
if
this
is
what
you're
talking
about
then
i'm
--
i
certainly
can
agree
with
the
court
if
we're
talking
about
a
definition
similar
to
obscenity
for
adults
and
with
all
of
the
requirements
that
it
has
there,
i
think
it
will
not
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
meet
the
end
that
it
must
meet.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that's
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
what
we're
referring
to
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
that
they
are
not
truly
relevant
to
this
problem
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
to
the
thing
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
this
case.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
we
have
attempted
to
establish
a
test
in
the
ordinance
whether
or
not
it's
constitutional
is
of
course
a
question
that
is
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
now
being
presented.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
to
determine
what
the
test
should
be,
we're
trying
to
apply
of
the
law
we
can
muster
to
try
to
arrive
at
this
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
well,
the
only
thing
we
been
able
to
muster
at
this
point
are
the
indications
by
this
court
that
this
is
a
special
problem
and
a
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
and
that
is
the
protection
of
its
young
people.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
then
in
the
context
--
yes,
in
the
context
of
the
obscenity
cases
for
adults,
then
we've
tried
to
adapt
it
over
as
best
as
we
can
and
without
going
too
far
we
hope
in
this
respect.
now,
to
do
that
is
just
as
hard
as
it
is
to
define
obscenity
as
such
and
to
determine
what
is
obscenity?
we
know
this
and
for
that
reason
maybe
inaptly
sometimes
we
have
expressed
it.
i
cannot
answer
with
certain
definiteness
the
mr.
chief
justice's
question
because
i'm
not
sure
that
it
can
be
answered
as
a
definite
factor.
i
hope
that
we
can
get
guidelines
in
which
we
can
reach
more
definiteness.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
we
are
--
we're
hoping
that
we
had
properly
interpreted.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes,
what
this
court
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
in
jacobellis,
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
yes.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
and
we're
trying
to
move
it
from
the
obscenity
for
adults
over
to
the
protection
of
children
without
doing
violence
to
the
first
amendment
as
best
we
can.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
your
honor,
we've
talked
about
obscenity
here
and
if
we're
talking
about
obscenity
as
it
can
be
defined
so
far
as
it
concerns
children
and
we
think
that
this
is
generally
what
we've
done
in
this
ordinance
then
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
of
exhibition
--
mr.
n.
alex
bickley
--
to
those
below
the
age
of
16
years.
this
was
the
same
thing
that
mr.
justice
hughes
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
in
new
orleans
said
the
due
obscenity
rules
if
applied
to
this
statute
would
be
proper.
