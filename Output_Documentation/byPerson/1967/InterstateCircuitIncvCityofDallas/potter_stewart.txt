justice
potter
stewart
is
that
literally
true?
i
thought
that
a
--
if
such
a
person
were
accompanied
by
a
parent
or
a
spouse
or
--
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
does
the
city
council
of
dallas
doesn't
have
any
power
whatsoever
to
tell
the
supreme
court
of
texas
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
that
you
lack
in
any
case,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
freedman
case
involved,
did
it
not,
the
denial
of
a
license
to
exhibit
the
movie?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
not
at
all,
is
it?
(voice

exhibit
this
movie
and
play
it
everyday
for
six
months
in
dallas
ground
out
your
projectors
24
hours
a
day
as
far
as
i
know
if
you
just
put
on
it
not
suitable
for
children.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
some
arbitrary
about
every
age
limit,
how
much
differences
there
in
voting
between
somebody
who's
20
years
and
11
months
and
29
days
and
somebody
who
has
a
day
older
and
yet
that
makes
a
four-year
difference
and
when
he
can
vote
in
a
presidential
election.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
was
anything
wrong
about
that
18-year-old
evidence
as
ordinance,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
your
question,
your
hypothetical
question.
justice
potter
stewart
in
between
in
18
and
a
16-year-old
cut
off
date.
this
court
has
never
held
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
18.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
the
first
amendment,
i
suppose,
philosophically
you
would
agree
depends
and
grows
from
the
concept
of
free
choice.
anybody
is
free
to
say
or
print
what
he
wants
and
anybody
is
free
to
listen
or
to
read
what
he
wants.
justice
potter
stewart
and
free
choice,
i
suppose,
is
that
philosophy
is
on
the
premise
of
the
capacity
to
make
free
choice
to
make
choices.
and
i
suppose
you
and
i
would
both
agree
that
a
child
of
18
months
doesn't
have
that
capacity,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
must
be
some
period
at
which
the
first
amendment
is
no
longer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
long
this
(voice

of
you
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
up
here
now.
justice
potter
stewart
565
out

i
have?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.

stewart

the

564

the

justice
potter
stewart
does
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
you
would
say
--
i
suppose
at
least
partly
respectable
argument
could
be
made
that
under
the
united
states
constitution,
a
state
or
a
municipality
would
be
constitutionally
free
to
say
that
no
children
under
16
could
go
to
any
movies
at
all
say
after
8
p.m.
unless
accompanied
by
their
parents
or
could
say
that
no
children
under
16
could
go
to
movies
unless
accompanied
by
their
parents
that
the
board
had
expressed
an
opinion
about
were
unsuitable
for
children
based
on
--
maybe
the
board
might
say
that
all
we
want
to
children
to
see
in
our
community
are
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarfs.
quite
without
reference
to
obscenity
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
your
real
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
our
obscenity
cases
are
not
truly
