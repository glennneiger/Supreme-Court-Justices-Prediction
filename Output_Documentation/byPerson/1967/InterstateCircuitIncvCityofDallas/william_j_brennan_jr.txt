justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
nizer,
i
don't
follow
this.
this
is
to
the
extent
if
i
may,
to
the
extent
that
any
proceeding
under
this
ordinance
involves
the
viewing
by
a
person,
young
person
of
the
film
transpired
and
so
forth.
it
shall
be
a
valid
defense.
now,
wasn't
this
proceeding
under
this
ordinance,
the
one
we
had
before
it,
is
it?
it's
a
proceeding
with
the
purposes
of
that
section,
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
--
excuse
me
for
a
moment,
if
i
may?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
what
--
what's
the
contents
you
give
other
proceeding
under
this
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
it
might
not
be
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
kind
of
proceeding
that
this
ordinance
authorizes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
really
mean
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
other
proceeding
being
a
proceeding
for
an
injunction
against
the
sharing
of
the
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
that
would
be
a
defense
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
to
proceed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
it
--
the
interval
from
the
time
this
picture
was
filed
with
this
board
until
the
february
18th
date
when
the
trial
court
entered
its
judgment
was
how
many
days.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
nine
days
then
from
the
time
of
filing
with
the
board
until
the
trial
court
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
forgetting
the
other
aspects
on
which
you
challenged
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
court,
as
a
time
interval,
do
you
think
that
would
come
within
freedman
in
nine
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
so,
on
the
time
then
your
real
complain
i
gather
is
that
it
then
took
upwards
to
better
than
eight
months
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
appellate
process
was
completed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
find
anything
in
freedman
that
purports
to
say
the
states
that
they
must
so
order
their
appellate
processes
as
to
give
appellate
review
in
these
cases
on
a
priority
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
thing
in
freedman
that
says
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
used
it
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
another
--
if
there
isn't
another
problem
involved
here,
on
what
can
depend
any
order
of
this
court
to
the
states
that
they
must
so
order
their
appellate
procedures
in
their
highest
courts
as
to
determine
appellate
review
in
these
cases
before
they
determine
anything
else,
capital
cases
or
other
cases
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
do
we
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this
mr.
hartt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
how
this
--
what
your
approach
concretely
is.
obviously,
the
city
of
dallas
could
not
include
in
any
ordinance,
i
gather,
these
municipal
ordinances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
could
not
have
a
provision
that
any
appellate
review
must
be
within
x
number
of
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
couldn't
be
done
that.
so
what
you're
saying,
i
gather,
is
that
this
ordinance
we
should
say
must
be
inoperative,
however
otherwise,
it
maybe
constitutional.
it
must
be
declared
completely
inoperative
unless
and
until
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
says
that
any
judgment
under
this
ordinance
must
be
reviewed
and
finally
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
within
some
specified
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
frankly
don't
think
that
you
can
consistently
do
it.
i
personally
don't
know.
well
let's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
this
ordinance
allows
even
as
to
this
part
--
this
motion
picture,
as
i
understand
it
there's
any
provision
in
this
ordinance
that
one
under
16
may
see
the
picture
if
taken
to
the
picture
by
parent,
guardian,
wife,
or
spouse
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
addressed
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
ordinance
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
any
other
proceeding
whatever
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
seen
it
by
the
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
seen
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
fun?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
here
you
mean
it's
marginal
only
in
the
sense
that
applying
the
standard
that's
taken
as
a
whole,
these
few
incidents
may
not
completely
colored
as
--
as
would
perhaps
whole
series
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
gave
no
reasons
either,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
this
the
case
where
the
judge
brought
in
from
some
outlying
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he's
the
one
who
said,
“i've
got
too
much
work
back
at
my
--
back
at
home
to
be
fussing
around
with
this,
it's
enough
and
let
it
go”,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
certainly
reads
like
that,
they
tried
very
hard
to
get
them
the
status
--
to
make
some
findings
of
fact
then
he
refused
to
make
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
here's
what
he
said,
“i
decline
when
i
asked.
i
have
so
many
irons
for
little
fellow.
i
have
taken
on
more
than
i
can
do
trying
to
decide
a
big
case
here
and
i've
got
others
at
home
and
here
and
then
hill
county
where
i
have
been
helping
out.
i
don't
have
the
time
to
do
it,
i
decline.”
that's
what
he
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
--
is
this
the
one
then?
“i
realize
you
gentlemen
might
be
right”,
i
guess
he
was
talking
to
interstate
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
“there
are
two
or
three
features
in
this
picture
that
look
to
me
would
be
unsuitable
to
young
people,
actually
they
have
tried
to
track
that
freedman
case
looks
like
in
this
ordinance
and
if
any
ordinance
can
be
passed
where
it
looks
like
they
have
taken
every
ground
to
pass
whether
one
can
be
valid,
this
is
valid”.
that's
what
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
think
mr.
bickley,
don't
you,
that
that
requirement
of
filing
of
notice
of
nonacceptance
is
surely
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
things
said
in
the
freedman
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
freedman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
isn't
it?
or
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
emphasis
that
freedman
gave
to
the
burden
being
upon
the
government
to
proceed
to
the
initial
determination
by
a
judge?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
way
this
works
if
whoever
suppose
to
file
the
--
and
it's
definitely
--
who
may
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance
besides
the
exhibitor?
is
it
only
the
chap
who
submits
the
picture
for
classification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
exhibitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
this
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
united
artist
could
not
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
oh!
you
assume
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
ordinance
makes
the
failure
to
file
the
notice
of
nonacceptance
that
makes
them,
what
do
you
call
this
board,
classification
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
determination,
final
doesn't
it?
never
again
subject
to
judicial
review
anywhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
if
there
is
another
exhibitor,
but
suppose
there
isn't
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may
then
resubmit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
he
can
resubmit
the
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
you
call
it
censorship
or
not,
certainly
in
freedman,
we
have
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
procedures
like
is
not
violating
the
first
amendment,
as
long
as
the
procedures
we
specified
in
freedman
are
followed,
haven't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
call
it
--
so
i
think
myself
for
this
censorship
where
it's
a
kind
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
that's
what
freedman
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
see
a
lot
of
movies
for
nothing,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
matter
of
interest,
do
they
have
their
own
projection
room
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
with
the
local
theaters
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
sometimes
some
of
these
cases
are
settled
by
the
distributor
or
exhibitor
agreeing
to
delete
certain
scenes
and
that
sort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
they
ever
offered
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
suitable
for
children?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
are
willing
to
exhibit
it
in
dallas
with
the
label
on
it
in
our
advertising
not
suitable
for
children
under
the
ordinance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bickley,
i
gather
this
under
18
ordinance,
municipal
ordinance,
that's
been
repealed,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
replaced
by
this
under
16?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
criminal
offense
only
for
the
exhibitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
for
the
parent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
the
parent
nor
the
child
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
of
course
he's
15
and
he's
asked
to
the
cashier,
i'm
15,
the
cashier
says,
go
in
and
he
goes
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
boy
subject
to
any
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
exhibitor
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
had
any
prosecutions
under
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
means
that
a
young
person
of
16
who
happen
to
get
in
will
be
prosecuted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
what
--
what's
the
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
will
be
prosecuted,
what's
the
fine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no
imprisonment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
knowingly
permit
comes
under
section
46
(a)
(4)
(a)
which
as
i
read
it
applies
only
to
an
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
or
his
employee
knowingly--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
permit
any
young
person
to
view
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
bickley
against
what
standard
are
we
to
test
our
view
of
this
motion
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
we're
not
going
to
test
it
against
any
standard
of
obscenity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
--whenever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
have
viewed
motion
pictures
before,
it
has
been
in
the
context
of
an
argument
that
motion
picture
is
not
obscene
within
the
definition
of
obscenity
that
the
court
has
fashioned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
the
way
we'd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
look
at
this.
well,
now
how
can
we
know,
what
are
we
to
take,
out
47
different
standards
or
something
in
this
ordinance,
some
about
mr.
nizer
said
there
were
great
number?
are
we
to
test
to
see
whether
it
complies
with
anyone
as
we
view
what
the
standard
means
without
your
courts
telling
us
what
it
means
or
without
the
board
telling
us
which
of
the
several
standards
would
apply
when
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
passed
by
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
remised
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
have
a
little
sympathy
for
our
shore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
well,
what
are
we
--
well,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
we
don't
know
what
under
which
this
was
classified,
do
we,
because
we
haven't
been
told
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
bickley,
i
--
it's
like
asking
you
so
many
questions
--
but
when
you
say
you
drew
on
something
this
court
said,
are
you
--
do
you
have
reference
to
what
--
in
opinion
in
jacobellis
said
on
this
subject?
is
that
what
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
when
you
said
that
there
was
something
that
this
court
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you're
speaking
of
what
was
said
in
jacobellis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
of
course
was
in
the
context
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
just
said
and
answered
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
stewart
that
you're
trying
to
reach
for
something
beyond
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
context
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
getting
beyond
the
obscenity
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
what
you've
generally
done
really
is
focus
on
obscenity
in
the
context
of
exhibition
to
children
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
the
freedman
was
not
five
to
four.
maybe
it
was
seven
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
freedman
is
the
one
that's
settled,
isn't
it?
the
proposition
that
there
are
distinctions
which
justify
the
measure
of
prior
restraints
with
freedman
sanction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
was
not
a
five
to
four
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
nizer,
i
don't
follow
this.
this
is
to
the
extent
if
i
may,
to
the
extent
that
any
proceeding
under
this
ordinance
involves
the
viewing
by
a
person,
young
person
of
the
film
transpired
and
so
forth.
it
shall
be
a
valid
defense.
now,
wasn't
this
proceeding
under
this
ordinance,
the
one
we
had
before
it,
is
it?
it's
a
proceeding
with
the
purposes
of
that
section,
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
--
excuse
me
for
a
moment,
if
i
may?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
what
--
what's
the
contents
you
give
other
proceeding
under
this
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
it
might
not
be
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
kind
of
proceeding
that
this
ordinance
authorizes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
really
mean
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
other
proceeding
being
a
proceeding
for
an
injunction
against
the
sharing
of
the
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
that
would
be
a
defense
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
to
proceed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
it
--
the
interval
from
the
time
this
picture
was
filed
with
this
board
until
the
february
18th
date
when
the
trial
court
entered
its
judgment
was
how
many
days.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
nine
days
then
from
the
time
of
filing
with
the
board
until
the
trial
court
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
forgetting
the
other
aspects
on
which
you
challenged
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
court,
as
a
time
interval,
do
you
think
that
would
come
within
freedman
in
nine
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
so,
on
the
time
then
your
real
complain
i
gather
is
that
it
then
took
upwards
to
better
than
eight
months
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
appellate
process
was
completed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
find
anything
in
freedman
that
purports
to
say
the
states
that
they
must
so
order
their
appellate
processes
as
to
give
appellate
review
in
these
cases
on
a
priority
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
thing
in
freedman
that
says
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
used
it
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
another
--
if
there
isn't
another
problem
involved
here,
on
what
can
depend
any
order
of
this
court
to
the
states
that
they
must
so
order
their
appellate
procedures
in
their
highest
courts
as
to
determine
appellate
review
in
these
cases
before
they
determine
anything
else,
capital
cases
or
other
cases
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
do
we
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this
mr.
hartt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
how
this
--
what
your
approach
concretely
is.
obviously,
the
city
of
dallas
could
not
include
in
any
ordinance,
i
gather,
these
municipal
ordinances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
could
not
have
a
provision
that
any
appellate
review
must
be
within
x
number
of
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
couldn't
be
done
that.
so
what
you're
saying,
i
gather,
is
that
this
ordinance
we
should
say
must
be
inoperative,
however
otherwise,
it
maybe
constitutional.
it
must
be
declared
completely
inoperative
unless
and
until
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
says
that
any
judgment
under
this
ordinance
must
be
reviewed
and
finally
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
within
some
specified
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
frankly
don't
think
that
you
can
consistently
do
it.
i
personally
don't
know.
well
let's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
this
ordinance
allows
even
as
to
this
part
--
this
motion
picture,
as
i
understand
it
there's
any
provision
in
this
ordinance
that
one
under
16
may
see
the
picture
if
taken
to
the
picture
by
parent,
guardian,
wife,
or
spouse
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
addressed
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
ordinance
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
any
other
proceeding
whatever
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
seen
it
by
the
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
seen
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
fun?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
here
you
mean
it's
marginal
only
in
the
sense
that
applying
the
standard
that's
taken
as
a
whole,
these
few
incidents
may
not
completely
colored
as
--
as
would
perhaps
whole
series
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
gave
no
reasons
either,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
this
the
case
where
the
judge
brought
in
from
some
outlying
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he's
the
one
who
said,
“i've
got
too
much
work
back
at
my
--
back
at
home
to
be
fussing
around
with
this,
it's
enough
and
let
it
go”,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
certainly
reads
like
that,
they
tried
very
hard
to
get
them
the
status
--
to
make
some
findings
of
fact
then
he
refused
to
make
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
here's
what
he
said,
“i
decline
when
i
asked.
i
have
so
many
irons
for
little
fellow.
i
have
taken
on
more
than
i
can
do
trying
to
decide
a
big
case
here
and
i've
got
others
at
home
and
here
and
then
hill
county
where
i
have
been
helping
out.
i
don't
have
the
time
to
do
it,
i
decline.”
that's
what
he
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
--
is
this
the
one
then?
“i
realize
you
gentlemen
might
be
right”,
i
guess
he
was
talking
to
interstate
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
“there
are
two
or
three
features
in
this
picture
that
look
to
me
would
be
unsuitable
to
young
people,
actually
they
have
tried
to
track
that
freedman
case
looks
like
in
this
ordinance
and
if
any
ordinance
can
be
passed
where
it
looks
like
they
have
taken
every
ground
to
pass
whether
one
can
be
valid,
this
is
valid”.
that's
what
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
think
mr.
bickley,
don't
you,
that
that
requirement
of
filing
of
notice
of
nonacceptance
is
surely
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
things
said
in
the
freedman
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
freedman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
isn't
it?
or
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
emphasis
that
freedman
gave
to
the
burden
being
upon
the
government
to
proceed
to
the
initial
determination
by
a
judge?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
way
this
works
if
whoever
suppose
to
file
the
--
and
it's
definitely
--
who
may
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance
besides
the
exhibitor?
is
it
only
the
chap
who
submits
the
picture
for
classification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
exhibitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
this
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
united
artist
could
not
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
oh!
you
assume
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
ordinance
makes
the
failure
to
file
the
notice
of
nonacceptance
that
makes
them,
what
do
you
call
this
board,
classification
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
determination,
final
doesn't
it?
never
again
subject
to
judicial
review
anywhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
if
there
is
another
exhibitor,
but
suppose
there
isn't
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may
then
resubmit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
he
can
resubmit
the
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
you
call
it
censorship
or
not,
certainly
in
freedman,
we
have
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
procedures
like
is
not
violating
the
first
amendment,
as
long
as
the
procedures
we
specified
in
freedman
are
followed,
haven't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
call
it
--
so
i
think
myself
for
this
censorship
where
it's
a
kind
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
that's
what
freedman
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
see
a
lot
of
movies
for
nothing,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
matter
of
interest,
do
they
have
their
own
projection
room
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
with
the
local
theaters
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
sometimes
some
of
these
cases
are
settled
by
the
distributor
or
exhibitor
agreeing
to
delete
certain
scenes
and
that
sort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
they
ever
offered
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
suitable
for
children?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
are
willing
to
exhibit
it
in
dallas
with
the
label
on
it
in
our
advertising
not
suitable
for
children
under
the
ordinance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bickley,
i
gather
this
under
18
ordinance,
municipal
ordinance,
that's
been
repealed,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
replaced
by
this
under
16?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
criminal
offense
only
for
the
exhibitor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
for
the
parent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
the
parent
nor
the
child
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
of
course
he's
15
and
he's
asked
to
the
cashier,
i'm
15,
the
cashier
says,
go
in
and
he
goes
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
boy
subject
to
any
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
exhibitor
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
had
any
prosecutions
under
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
means
that
a
young
person
of
16
who
happen
to
get
in
will
be
prosecuted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
what
--
what's
the
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
will
be
prosecuted,
what's
the
fine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no
imprisonment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
knowingly
permit
comes
under
section
46
(a)
(4)
(a)
which
as
i
read
it
applies
only
to
an
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
or
his
employee
knowingly--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
permit
any
young
person
to
view
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
bickley
against
what
standard
are
we
to
test
our
view
of
this
motion
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
we're
not
going
to
test
it
against
any
standard
of
obscenity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
--whenever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
have
viewed
motion
pictures
before,
it
has
been
in
the
context
of
an
argument
that
motion
picture
is
not
obscene
within
the
definition
of
obscenity
that
the
court
has
fashioned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
the
way
we'd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
look
at
this.
well,
now
how
can
we
know,
what
are
we
to
take,
out
47
different
standards
or
something
in
this
ordinance,
some
about
mr.
nizer
said
there
were
great
number?
are
we
to
test
to
see
whether
it
complies
with
anyone
as
we
view
what
the
standard
means
without
your
courts
telling
us
what
it
means
or
without
the
board
telling
us
which
of
the
several
standards
would
apply
when
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
passed
by
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
remised
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
have
a
little
sympathy
for
our
shore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
well,
what
are
we
--
well,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
we
don't
know
what
under
which
this
was
classified,
do
we,
because
we
haven't
been
told
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
bickley,
i
--
it's
like
asking
you
so
many
questions
--
but
when
you
say
you
drew
on
something
this
court
said,
are
you
--
do
you
have
reference
to
what
--
in
opinion
in
jacobellis
said
on
this
subject?
is
that
what
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
when
you
said
that
there
was
something
that
this
court
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you're
speaking
of
what
was
said
in
jacobellis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
of
course
was
in
the
context
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
just
said
and
answered
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
stewart
that
you're
trying
to
reach
for
something
beyond
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
context
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
getting
beyond
the
obscenity
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
what
you've
generally
done
really
is
focus
on
obscenity
in
the
context
of
exhibition
to
children
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
the
freedman
was
not
five
to
four.
maybe
it
was
seven
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
freedman
is
the
one
that's
settled,
isn't
it?
the
proposition
that
there
are
distinctions
which
justify
the
measure
of
prior
restraints
with
freedman
sanction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
was
not
a
five
to
four
decision.
