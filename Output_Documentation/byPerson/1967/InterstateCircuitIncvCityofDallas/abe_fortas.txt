justice
abe
fortas
what
does
this
mean
then
to
the
extent
that
any
prosecution
or
other
proceeding
under
this
ordinance
involves
the
entering,
purchasing
of
a
ticket,
etcetera
for
viewing
by
a
young
person
in
such
a
film,
it
shall
be
a
valid
offense.
do
you
construe
that
as
meaning
that
this
defense
is
available
only
in
a
prosecution
of
the
young
person,
is
that
what
i
understand
this
is
your
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
not
at
all
sir.
not
at
all
mr.
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
does
the
city
of
dallas,
how
to
--
have
they
construed
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
ask
you
mr.
nizer.
suppose
the
ordinance
said
that
children
under
the
age
of
16
shall
not
exercise
a,
what
i
suppose,
his
constitutional
right
feasibly
to
assemble
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
submission
is
that
you
don't
challenge
that
proposition
that
that
would
be
constitutional
for
a
state
or
a
city
to
say
that
no
child,
age
16
or
less
--under
the
age
of
16
shall
be
permitted
to
attend
any
movies?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
anyway
isn't
that
a
difference
in
good
sense
between
the
way
one
would
look
at
freedman
in
terms
of
a
total
suppression
or
something,
in
a
way
one
would
look
at
freedman
in
terms
of
an
ordinance.
it
says
that
children
can't
be
allowed
to
view
this.
isn't
there
qualitative
difference
there?
even
if
you
assume,
isn't
it
conceivable
that
you
could
have
an
arrangement
that
might
offend
freedman
if
it
were
total
suppression
do
you
see?
in
one
hand,
but
would
not
offend
freedman
if
it
were
suppression
that
was
confined
to
excluding
children?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
it
was
marginal
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
it
was
marginal.
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
your
--
is
it
the
position
of
the
city
of
dallas
that
you
can
apply
this
statute
in
what
you
style
marginal
situations
of
this
ordinance
--
on
what
you
style
marginal
situations?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
i'm
not
asking
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
prefer
doing.
i'm
asking
you
whether
it's
your
position
that
under
this
ordinance
the
prohibitions
of
this
ordinance
maybe
applied
in
marginal
situations.
remember,
they
were
talking
about
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
answer
to
my
question?
i
say
that's
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
the
following
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
let
us
assume
that
this
board
said
to
the
city
attorney
or
whoever
its
counsel
is,
we
believe
that
this
motion
picture
is
marginal
for
purposes
of
application
of
this
ordinance,
for
purposes
of
application
of
this
ordinance.
in
view
of
our
conclusion
that
this
is
marginal,
is
it
alright
for
us
to
go
again
and
apply
the
ordinance
to
this
picture?
i'm
asking
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
our
view
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
all
these
people
serve
without
pay,
don't
they?
the
members
serve
without
pay?
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
does
it
cost
you,
how
much
does
it
cost
a
child
to
be
admitted
to
this
intellectual
and
emotional
feast
in
the
theatre
there?
what's
the
admission
charge?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
this
mean
then
to
the
extent
that
any
prosecution
or
other
