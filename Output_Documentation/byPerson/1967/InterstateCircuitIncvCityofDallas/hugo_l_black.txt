it's
something

no

20-and-a-half

you

could
he
be

criminally

think
that
would

it
provides
that
now?

it
has

i
accept
your

i
am
sure
that
you
can
hold

i
heard
your
statement
about

--
how
about

well,
i

did.
i
--
i
couldn't
quite
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
get
to
the
word
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
get
to
the
word
in
the
constitution.
it
is
an
abridgement
of
the
right
of
free
speech,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
an
abridgement,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
possible,
is
it
a
possible
or
is
it
an
abridgement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
it,
do
you
say
it's
--
it's
not
certain
as
an
abridgement
if
the
government,
state
or
municipal
demands
that
somebody
before
they
say
something
or
show
a
picture,
turn
it
over
to
the
law
to
be
looked
at
by
board?
do
you
say
that
leaves
the
question
of
whether
it's
an
abridgement
of
free
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
believes
what
it
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
the
argument
there
was
that
that
really
was
a
speech,
as
just
kind
of
exploiting
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
board
or
council
--
how
many
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
their
occupations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
their
occupations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
then
none
of
them
have
any
political
affiliation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
housewife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
have
the
ins
and
the
outs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
do
they
offer
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
think
it's
not
suitable,
why
wouldn't
they
just
not
use
them
if
that's
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
once
they
offer
it
to
the
board
and
say
it,
“we
want
to
show
it
but
we
recognize
and
come
to
you
and
tell
you
it's
not
suitable
for
the
young
persons.”
i
don't
understand
that
procedure,
why
they
wouldn't
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understand
is
when
the
exhibitors
want
to
exhibit
a
picture,
comes
up
and
says,
“now,
here
i'm
submitting
to
this
board,
for
examination,
look
at
this
picture,
i
myself
do
not
think
i
want
to
offer
it.
it
should
not
be
shown.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
bad
picture
to
show.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we're
going
to
offer
it
to
you.
why
don't
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is,
isn't
in
that
idea
meeting
their
consideration,
they
would
be
satisfied
to
have
this
picture
exhibited
by
--
with
the
statement
that
we
don't
think
it's
suitable
for
children,
but
that
wouldn't
be
good
to
be
saying
--
it
is
going
to
enter
into
a
legal
agreement,
somebody
could
be
tried
if
a
child
went,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
protects
the
sale
of
liquor
such
as
there
is
to
protect
freedom
of
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
way
a
parent
can
and
if
he
wants
his
child
to
see
a
picture,
he's
16,
he
can
let
him
see
it
if
you
go
with
him.
but
if
he
doesn't
go
with
him,
it's
a
criminal
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
boy
that
goes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
offense
if
he
goes
to
see
it?
without
his
father?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
he
got
in
--
suppose
he
doesn't
just
tell
it
direct
falsification,
but
that
he
goes
up
and
buys
ticket,
he's
represented
and
he's
old
enough
to
go
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
could
be
charged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
yet
tried
to
censor
any
books
that
may
have
story
like
this
what
you
say
is
bad
in
this
particular
picture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
who
read
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
doesn't
he
have
the
same
right
to
take
care
of
his
child
by
letting
him
go
to
a
movie
if
he
wants
to
without
going
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
expect
to
be
that
way
and
explain
it
to
him
as
they
go
along?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
also
provides
the
punishment
for
anyone
who
knowingly
permits
him
to
view
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
so
suppose
his
father
permitted
him
knowingly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
wouldn't
that
be
censorship
if
i
--
if
playing
with
words
the
court
took
that,
why
wouldn't
that
be
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
first
amendment
gives
the
right
to
speak
and
the
right
to
hear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
condition
is
the
right
to
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that--
it's
quite
a
different
thing,
that's
doing
something
plus
free
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
marching
up
and
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
go
in
there
and
disturb
the
people.
nobody
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
speech
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
judges
should
adopt
it
to
meet
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
purpose
of
the
written
constitution
if
the
court
can
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
interpretation,
interpretation
in
explaining
what
you
think
it
means
and
it
means
when
it
came
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
quite
a
different
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
to
take
the
position,
that
the
court
should
adopt
it
to
meet
circumstances
of
the
time
even
though
it
didn't
do
that
as
it
was
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
court
must
obey
as
written?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
has
no
latitude
if
it's
to
be
construed
according
to
its
meaning
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
if
it
has
no
latitude,
it's
just
there
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
applies,
that's
the
way
it
should
be
amended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you?
why
would
you
have
a
right
to
go
into
a
church
and
disturb
that
meeting
but
the
church
own
the
church?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
freedom
of
speech
where
you
have
a
right
to
speak.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
--
that
doesn't
allow
you
to
come
in
here
for
instance
and
make
a
speech
or
go
into
a
church,
you
can't
do
that,
that's
not
freedom
of
speech.
that's
freedom
to
go
where
you
please
even
though
somebody
else
owns
a
property
in
our
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you?
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
you
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
if
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
then
why
wouldn't
you
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
it's
because
you
follow
the
constitution
as
it's
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mind
of
men
applied
to
it,
to
interpret
it
and
enforce
it
as
written
but
not
to
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
judges
have
anymore
right
to
change
it
than
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
much.

the
board
and
say
it,
“we
want
to
show
it
but
we
recognize
and
come
to
you
and
tell
you
it's
not
suitable
for
the
young
persons.”
i
don't
understand
that
procedure,
why
they
wouldn't
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understand
is
when
the
exhibitors
want
to
exhibit
a
picture,
comes
up
and
says,
“now,
here
i'm
submitting
to
this
board,
for
examination,
look
at
this
picture,
i
myself
do
not
think
i
want
to
offer
it.
it
should
not
be
shown.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
bad
picture
to
show.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we're
going
to
offer
it
to
you.
why
don't
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is,
isn't
in
that
idea
meeting
their
consideration,
they
would
be
satisfied
to
have
this
picture
exhibited
by
--
with
the
statement
that
we
don't
think
it's
suitable
for
children,
but
that
wouldn't
be
good
to
be
saying
--
it
is
going
to
enter
into
a
legal
agreement,
somebody
could
be
tried
if
a
child
went,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
protects
the
sale
of
liquor
such
as
there
is
to
protect
freedom
of
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
way
a
parent
can
and
if
he
wants
his
child
to
see
a
picture,
he's
16,
he
can
let
him
see
it
if
you
go
with
him.
but
if
he
doesn't
go
with
him,
it's
a
criminal
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
boy
that
goes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
offense
if
he
goes
to
see
it?
without
his
father?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
he
got
in
--
suppose
he
doesn't
just
tell
it
direct
falsification,
but
that
he
goes
up
and
buys
ticket,
he's
represented
and
he's
old
enough
to
go
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
could
be
charged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
yet
tried
to
censor
any
books
that
may
have
story
like
this
what
you
say
is
bad
in
this
particular
picture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
who
read
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
doesn't
he
have
the
same
right
to
take
care
of
his
child
by
letting
him
go
to
a
movie
if
he
wants
to
without
going
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
expect
to
be
that
way
and
explain
it
to
him
as
they
go
along?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
also
provides
the
punishment
for
anyone
who
knowingly
permits
him
to
view
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
so
suppose
his
father
permitted
him
knowingly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
wouldn't
that
be
censorship
if
i
--
if
playing
with
words
the
court
took
that,
why
wouldn't
that
be
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
first
amendment
gives
the
right
to
speak
and
the
right
to
hear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
condition
is
the
right
to
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that--
it's
quite
a
different
thing,
that's
doing
something
plus
free
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
marching
up
and
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
go
in
there
and
disturb
the
people.
nobody
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
speech
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
judges
should
adopt
it
to
meet
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
purpose
of
the
written
constitution
if
the
court
can
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
interpretation,
interpretation
in
explaining
what
you
think
it
means
and
it
means
when
it
came
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
quite
a
different
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
to
take
the
position,
that
the
court
should
adopt
it
to
meet
circumstances
of
the
time
even
though
it
didn't
do
that
as
it
was
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
court
must
obey
as
written?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
has
no
latitude
if
it's
to
be
construed
according
to
its
meaning
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
if
it
has
no
latitude,
it's
just
there
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
applies,
that's
the
way
it
should
be
amended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you?
why
would
you
have
a
right
to
go
into
a
church
and
disturb
that
meeting
but
the
church
own
the
church?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
freedom
of
speech
where
you
have
a
right
to
speak.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
--
that
doesn't
allow
you
to
come
in
here
for
instance
and
make
a
speech
or
go
into
a
church,
you
can't
do
that,
that's
not
freedom
of
speech.
that's
freedom
to
go
where
you
please
even
though
somebody
else
owns
a
property
in
our
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you?
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
you
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
if
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
then
why
wouldn't
you
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
it's
because
you
follow
the
constitution
as
it's
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mind
of
men
applied
to
it,
to
interpret
it
and
enforce
it
as
written
but
not
to
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
judges
have
anymore
right
to
change
it
than
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
much.
