would
you

there
will

this

how

particularly,
in

of
what
it's

that
preventing

from
seeing
the

you
describe
the

doesn't
sound
marginal

the

supposedly
attempts
to
keep
young

from
seeing
precisely
the
kinds
of
things
that
you
have

has
earned
this

now,
what's
marginal?
what
so
marginal
about

about
these

because
there's
only
one

this

the

it
say
on

that
a

may
be
classified
this

that
you've
been
telling
us
about,
you
wouldn't
think
it
would
be
marginal
now?

in

of
the
quality
of

you
think
it's
the
kind
of

the

does?

thoroughly
is
the
kind
of
a
thing
the

was
attempting

well
i
mean
--
let's
say
it's
--
it's
not
a
marginal?
justice

what
happens
if
the

itself
in

does
that
happen?

well,
when

does
as
the
unsuitable

it
that
