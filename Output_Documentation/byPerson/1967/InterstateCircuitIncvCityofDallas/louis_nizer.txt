mr.
louis
nizer
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
represent
united
artists
corporation,
the
distributor
of
the
motion
picture
“viva
maria."
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
injunction
enforcing
an
author
of
the
dallas
motion
picture
classification
board
which
prohibits
the
exhibition
of
the
motion
picture
“viva
maria”
to
any
person
under
the
age
of
16
in
any
theater
within
the
city
of
dallas.
the
injunction
also
requires
that
all
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
your
honor.
the
city
has
so
contended
apparently
to
ameliorate
the
situation
presented.
the
ordinance
does
not
permit
that.
the
ordinance
has
no
exemption
that
states
at
section
46a,
subdivision
5
that
it
is
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
to
sell
a
ticket
or
permit
a
young
person
to
see
a
picture
classified
not
suitable,
period.
there's
no
exemption
if
accompanied
by
a
parent.
had
an
exemption
been
intended,
this
section
would've
contained
the
obvious
phrase,
“unless
accompanied
by
parent
or
guardian."
now
this
is
true
sir,
that
there's
another
section
of
remedy
in
the
event
of
a
prosecution
of
a
child.
if
a
child
is
prosecuted
for
entering,
it
is
a
defense
to
hear.
an
affirmative
defense
that
he
was
accompanied
by
a
guardian
or
a
parent,
that's
at
page
127
of
the
record,
sir.
that's
subdivision
(d).
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
and
not
even
from
an
exhibitor
if
you
were
prosecuted.
that's
unclear.
it
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
we
don't
think
it
would
even
apply
to
an
exhibitor.
we
think
that
there
was
rational
and
deliberate
this
and
this.
the
section
made
it
a
crime
for
an
exhibitor
knowingly
to
permit
a
child
to
see
the
picture,
period.
if
however,
that
child
is
brought
on
criminal
charges,
it
was
thought
advisable
to
give
him
the
remedy
that
he
could
say,
“well,
i'm
not
guilty
of
a
crime
because
i
had
my
father
with
me."
but
the
section
does
not
carryover
to
the
exemption
that
is
claimed
otherwise.
could
there
been
any
judicial
rulings
on
that,
mr.
nizer?
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
they
contend
vigorously
that
this
ordinance
permits
even
children
under
16
to
see
the
picture
marked
unsuitable
if
it
is
accompanied
--
if
the
child
is
accompanied
by
a
guardian,
parent
or
spouse,
he
maybe
married.
this
is
the
contention
of
this
city.
we
do
not
find
it
in
the
ordinance
which
we
asked
to
be
appraised
here.
but
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
point
a
few
more
infirmities
with
respect
to
that
particular
matter
mr.
justice
fortas.
aside
from
the
exhibitor
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
construe
that
mr.
justice
brennan
to
mean
if
anything
suspension
of
the
exhibitor's
license
which
is
one
of
the
penalties.
in
other
words,
there's
an
affirmative
defense
provided
in
the
event
of
extreme
remedies.
but
if
one
reads
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
might
be
a
suspension
of
a
license
of
the
exhibitor.
mr.
louis
nizer
if
you're
going
to
--
mr.
louis
nizer
even
--
mr.
louis
nizer
even
if
it
meant
that,
your
honor,
it
would
not
mean
that
a
child
could
enter
with
a
parent.
it
would
only
mean
that
if
a
criminal
prosecution
or
other
proceeding
would
be
gone
there
might
be
an
affirmative
defense
placing
the
burden
on
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
to
enforce
the
ordinance.
yes,
it
could
mean
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
and
affirm
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
person
defending
himself
to
demonstrate
weeks
and
months
after
a
child
that
entered
--
that
he
entered
with
a
certain
mature
person
who
was
his
guardian
or
parent.
as
against
that
interpretation
or
rather
the
ambiguity
if
we
may
say
of
that
section,
will
your
honor
be
good
enough
to
look
at
page
126.
under
the
heading
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
look
at
subdivisions
4
and
5,
particularly
5,
“knowingly
to
permit
any
young
person
to
view
the
exhibition
of
any
film
classified
not
suitable
for
young
persons
and
no
language
in
that
saying
unless
accompanied
by
a
parent
or
guardian.”
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
to
your
honor
that
even
if
the
city's
interpretation
were
accepted
on
this
point,
not
only
is
the
burden
of
defense,
the
affirmative
burden
of
defense
and
proof
shifted
as
it
never
should
have
been
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
a
defense
which
is
meaningless
in
practical
terms.
there
is
social
opprobrium
to
taking
a
child
into
a
picture
marked
in
large
letters
on
the
box
office
unsuitable
for
young
persons.
a
mother
or
a
father
would
have
to
brazen
out
that
entry
in
the
light
of
that.
a
fathers
and
mothers
often
don't
go
to
the
motion
picture
theaters
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
the
teenagers
go
by
themselves.
the
statute
requires
that
the
parents
sit
throughout
the
picture,
entirely.
the
--
if
a
father
took
his
son
and
his
boy
and
his
little
friend
with
him,
if
--
there
would
be
a
violation
because
the
friend
hasn't
got
his
parent
or
his
legal
guardian.
or
if
it
were
an
uncle
who
took
his
nephew
it
would
be
a
violation.
these
may
appear
to
be
refinements
in
reading
the
ordinance
but
where
an
ordinance
trespasses
upon
free
speech
we
think
that
the
expressions
of
this
court
that
there
must
be
the
least
remedy
applied
to
a
--
not
to
aggravate
then
necessitate
for
the
remedy
applies
here.
and
it
would
be
an
affirmative
burden
even
if
these
apply
to
an
exhibitor
under
the
most
liberal
interpretation
to
prove
that
the
adult
was
a
parent.
we
think
all
of
these
places
and
own
us
upon
this
the
right
of
free
speech
which
this
court
would
not
approve.
i
may
say
however,
that
this
isn't
the
basis
upon
which
or
at
least
the
sole
basis
at
all
upon
which
we
stand
here.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
that
would
be
alright
or
even
if
they
couldn't
attend
any
motion
picture
theater
under
a
certain
age
because
then
it
isn't
the
content
of
the
picture
which
is
in
question.
that's
for
the
conduct
and
safety
of
the
child.
we
have
permitted
many
ordinances
which
protect
the
child
as
for
example,
the
case
of
the
jehovah
witnesses
where
this
court
held
that
it
was
the
safety,
the
labor
--
child
labor
provisions
which
interested
this
court.
but
if
you
said,
this
child
as
a
jehovah
witness
cannot
sell
this
particular
pamphlet
because
of
its
content
that
would
be
illegal.
mr.
louis
nizer
right
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
new
york
mr.
justice
fortas,
there
is
such
a
statute
and
you
must
provide
a
matron
before
a
child
can
go
in.
and
the
theaters,
this
is
purely
a
safety
provision
to
provide
such
maintenance
or
they
are
not
admitted.
it
is
as
if
a
book,
if
there's
an
ordinance
or
statute
that
a
bookseller
may
not
sell
books
on
sunday.
if
it
were
just
all
books
on
sunday
that
would
be
legal,
if
he
said
it
couldn't
sell
a
certain
book
on
sunday,
i
think
it
would
be
illegal.
so
that
we
must
distinguish
i
think
between
all
the
ordinances
and
statutes
which
provide
for
the
safety
of
children
which
is
a
desirable
objective
not
infringing
upon
the
free
speech
doctrine.
now,
the
ordinance
provided
that
all
advertisements
and
a
prominent
poster
must
be
put
on
the
box
office
saying,
“not
suitable
for
young
person.”
and
this
dallas
board
was
created
by
an
ordinance
enacted
by
the
dallas
city
council
about
two
years
ago.
and
under
this
ordinance,
it
is
a
crime
to
show
any
motion
picture
in
dallas
unless
it
has
first
been
classified.
now
in
the
instant
case
your
honors,
united
artists
which
is
the
world
distributor
and
also
has
financial
interest
in
this
picture,
we
might
call
it
for
practical
purposes
a
producer
to
license
the
motion
picture
to
the
exhibitor,
interstate
circuit
for
exhibition
at
its
esquire
theater
in
dallas.
as
required
by
the
ordinance,
interstate
with
the
--
filed
with
the
board
its
proposed
classification
suitable
for
young
persons
as
--
and
provided
also
information
on
the
description
of
the
picture
as
it
was
required
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you,
sir.
the
standards
which
this
ordinance
sets
forth
have
in
many
areas
already
been
rejected
by
this
court.
it
might
be
worth
the
moment
to
look
at
the
standards
themselves.
in
determining
that
a
picture
is
not
suitable
for
children,
the
board
must
first
determine
whether
the
picture
describes
or
portrays
brutality,
criminal
violence
or
depravity
or
nudity
or
sexual
promiscuity
or
extramarital
or
abnormal
sex
relations.
second,
if
the
picture
describes
any
of
these
phenomena,
the
board
must
determine
whether
the
portrayal
is
such
that
it
is
likely
“to
insight
or
encourage”
crime
or
delinquency
or
actual
promiscuity
in
the
part
of
the
young
persons.
third,
in
determining
whether
it
is
likely
to
insight
or
encourage
crime,
delinquency
and
so
on,
the
board
must
determine
whether
there
is
in
its
judgment
“a
substantial
probability
that
it
will
create
an
impression
on
young
persons
that
such
conduct
is
profitable,
desirable,
acceptable,
respectable,
trustworthy
and
commonly
accepted.”
now,
identical
of
similar
standards
have
been
condemned
by
this
court
and
other
courts
as
too
vague
to
satisfy
constitutional
guarantees.
for
example,
“sexual
immorality”
people
against
bookcase;
“prejudicial
to
the
best
interest
of
the
people”,
the
gelling
case;
“creating
a
harmful
impression
on
the
minds
of
children”,
paramount
against
chicago
stricken
out;
“sexual
immorality
is
desirable,
acceptable,
or
improper
patterns
of
behavior”,
kingsley
stricken
out,
and
some
of
these
cases
of
course
have
dealt
with
the
protection
of
children.
that
doctrine
that
there
may
be
variable
obscenity
has
never
been
extended
to
mean
that
there
can
be
variable
vagueness
and
this
statute
is
void
and
defective
completely
because
of
vagueness.
just
two
or
three
other
brief
points,
it
has
been
suggested
here
for
the
first
time
that
my
client
united
artist
may
protest
and
has
standing
before
this
court.
that
is
not
so
at
page
128
of
the
record
without
reading
it
subdivision
7,
only
in
exhibitor
may
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance,
not
a
distributor
and
indeed
the
exhibitors
as
this
court
has
observed
takes
little
to
deter
the
exhibitor
from
going
to
this
kind
of
a
contest
and
that
one
occasion
we've
even
had
to
threaten
to
sue
the
exhibitors
so
we've
filed
as
nonacceptance
so
we
could
get
an
intervening
application.
second,
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
none
at
all.
and
we
have
protested
against
them
in
many
instances
and
we
have
no
standing
before
the
board.
mr.
louis
nizer
in
very
few,
if
any
though
i
have
not
the
statistics
before
me
but
i
will
go
further
mr.
justice
white.
the
exhibitor
has
yielded
against
his
will
in
these
matters.
there
is
this
matter
of
fighting
the
authorities
of
a
community
in
which
you
live
and
depend
upon
the
good
will
of
it
and
this
very
existence
of
this
ordinance
is
itself
a
suppression.
there
would
not
have
been
39
overrulings
in
the
exhibitors
who's
finally
saying
this
is
alright
with
me
when
he
submits
a
specific
request
for
a
suitable
classification
and
it's
overruled,
and
he
says
let's
go
along
because
he
doesn't
want
to
spend
the
money
for
counsel
to
come
up
here.
one
other
observation
about
the
freedman
case
which
i
think
we
owe
to
your
honor,
a
candid
statement
about
it.
we
don't
think
that
the
freedman
case
has
been
complied
within
consequently,
this
statute
is
void
in
any
event
in
this
application
to
the
reasons
i
have
given
that
you
can
have
a
complete
final
determination
without
any
judicial
participation
here.
but
i
would
--
i
think
we
owe
to
this
court
to
be
candid
to
say
that
the
motion
picture
industry
has
never
been
able
to
adjust
itself
to
the
proposition
that
while
other
medias
such
as
magazines,
newspapers,
television
even
comic
books
may
not
be
restrained
by
prior
consideration,
prior
submission
that
we
cannot
share
that
sunshine
and
that
we
stand
in
the
shadow
of
a
five
to
four
decision
which
says
that
we
alone,
the
motion
picture
industry
comes
into
a
special
category.
we
would
therefore
respectfully
suggest
now
that
this
has
demonstrated
the
ineffectualness
of
the
freedman
case
in
attempting
to
modify
the
effects
of
the
times
case
that
if
we
went
on
the
cause
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
the
times
case
was
five
to
four.
that's
the
one
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
not
that.
the
times
case
which
puts
the
motion
picture
industry
in
the
special
category
was
and
i
merely
observed
that
i
think
while
the
freedman
case
was
an
admirable
effort
to
avoid
the
abuse
by
these
judicial
requirements
that
nevertheless
it
hasn't
worked.
well,
here
we
are
on
viva
maria,
if
your
honor
if
you
see
that
picture
you'll
be
shock
that
this
picture
could
be
caught
in
that
kind
of
a
net
when
it
was
intended
for
something
else
and
next
day
it
will
be
something
else
and
then
it
will
be
as
i've
indicated
a
proliferation
of
these
ordinances.
i
wish
to
observe
that
while
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
there's
no
salary
to
these
people,
that
in
most
of
these
proposals,
they
not
only
receives
salaries
but
there
is
a
fee
for
submitting
the
picture
for
their
examination
and
you
get
the
entire
bureaucracy
imposed
upon
this.
and
i
think
that
this
will
cause
a
great
flood
of
this
kind
of
case
whereas
if
we
--
if
in
dealing
with
this
difficult
question,
if
we
subjected
the
restraint
to
at
least
to
penal
provisions
or
at
most
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
with
all
the
safeguards
for
a
defendant
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
then
i
think
this
perhaps
might
be
held
in
control.
and
the
penal
statute
would
get
after
the
man
that
should
get
after
some
case
where
somebody
is
really
trying
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
sensibilities
of
the
american
people.
this
is
not
this
case
at
all.
it
doesn't
even
come
up
on
obscenity.
mr.
louis
nizer
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
represent
united
artists
corporation,
the
distributor
of
the
motion
picture
“viva
maria."
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
injunction
enforcing
an
author
of
the
dallas
motion
picture
classification
board
which
prohibits
the
exhibition
of
the
motion
picture
“viva
maria”
to
any
person
under
the
age
of
16
in
any
theater
within
the
city
of
dallas.
the
injunction
also
requires
that
all
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
your
honor.
the
city
has
so
contended
apparently
to
ameliorate
the
situation
presented.
the
ordinance
does
not
permit
that.
the
ordinance
has
no
exemption
that
states
at
section
46a,
subdivision
5
that
it
is
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
to
sell
a
ticket
or
permit
a
young
person
to
see
a
picture
classified
not
suitable,
period.
there's
no
exemption
if
accompanied
by
a
parent.
had
an
exemption
been
intended,
this
section
would've
contained
the
obvious
phrase,
“unless
accompanied
by
parent
or
guardian."
now
this
is
true
sir,
that
there's
another
section
of
remedy
in
the
event
of
a
prosecution
of
a
child.
if
a
child
is
prosecuted
for
entering,
it
is
a
defense
to
hear.
an
affirmative
defense
that
he
was
accompanied
by
a
guardian
or
a
parent,
that's
at
page
127
of
the
record,
sir.
that's
subdivision
(d).
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
and
not
even
from
an
exhibitor
if
you
were
prosecuted.
that's
unclear.
it
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
we
don't
think
it
would
even
apply
to
an
exhibitor.
we
think
that
there
was
rational
and
deliberate
this
and
this.
the
section
made
it
a
crime
for
an
exhibitor
knowingly
to
permit
a
child
to
see
the
picture,
period.
if
however,
that
child
is
brought
on
criminal
charges,
it
was
thought
advisable
to
give
him
the
remedy
that
he
could
say,
“well,
i'm
not
guilty
of
a
crime
because
i
had
my
father
with
me."
but
the
section
does
not
carryover
to
the
exemption
that
is
claimed
otherwise.
could
there
been
any
judicial
rulings
on
that,
mr.
nizer?
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
they
contend
vigorously
that
this
ordinance
permits
even
children
under
16
to
see
the
picture
marked
unsuitable
if
it
is
accompanied
--
if
the
child
is
accompanied
by
a
guardian,
parent
or
spouse,
he
maybe
married.
this
is
the
contention
of
this
city.
we
do
not
find
it
in
the
ordinance
which
we
asked
to
be
appraised
here.
but
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
point
a
few
more
infirmities
with
respect
to
that
particular
matter
mr.
justice
fortas.
aside
from
the
exhibitor
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
construe
that
mr.
justice
brennan
to
mean
if
anything
suspension
of
the
exhibitor's
license
which
is
one
of
the
penalties.
in
other
words,
there's
an
affirmative
defense
provided
in
the
event
of
extreme
remedies.
but
if
one
reads
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
might
be
a
suspension
of
a
license
of
the
exhibitor.
mr.
louis
nizer
if
you're
going
to
--
mr.
louis
nizer
even
--
mr.
louis
nizer
even
if
it
meant
that,
your
honor,
it
would
not
mean
that
a
child
could
enter
with
a
parent.
it
would
only
mean
that
if
a
criminal
prosecution
or
other
proceeding
would
be
gone
there
might
be
an
affirmative
defense
placing
the
burden
on
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
to
enforce
the
ordinance.
yes,
it
could
mean
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
and
affirm
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
person
defending
himself
to
demonstrate
weeks
and
months
after
a
child
that
entered
--
that
he
entered
with
a
certain
mature
person
who
was
his
guardian
or
parent.
as
against
that
interpretation
or
rather
the
ambiguity
if
we
may
say
of
that
section,
will
your
honor
be
good
enough
to
look
at
page
126.
under
the
heading
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
exhibitor
or
his
employee.
look
at
subdivisions
4
and
5,
particularly
5,
“knowingly
to
permit
any
young
person
to
view
the
exhibition
of
any
film
classified
not
suitable
for
young
persons
and
no
language
in
that
saying
unless
accompanied
by
a
parent
or
guardian.”
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
to
your
honor
that
even
if
the
city's
interpretation
were
accepted
on
this
point,
not
only
is
the
burden
of
defense,
the
affirmative
burden
of
defense
and
proof
shifted
as
it
never
should
have
been
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
a
defense
which
is
meaningless
in
practical
terms.
there
is
social
opprobrium
to
taking
a
child
into
a
picture
marked
in
large
letters
on
the
box
office
unsuitable
for
young
persons.
a
mother
or
a
father
would
have
to
brazen
out
that
entry
in
the
light
of
that.
a
fathers
and
mothers
often
don't
go
to
the
motion
picture
theaters
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
the
teenagers
go
by
themselves.
the
statute
requires
that
the
parents
sit
throughout
the
picture,
entirely.
the
--
if
a
father
took
his
son
and
his
boy
and
his
little
friend
with
him,
if
--
there
would
be
a
violation
because
the
friend
hasn't
got
his
parent
or
his
legal
guardian.
or
if
it
were
an
uncle
who
took
his
nephew
it
would
be
a
violation.
these
may
appear
to
be
refinements
in
reading
the
ordinance
but
where
an
ordinance
trespasses
upon
free
speech
we
think
that
the
expressions
of
this
court
that
there
must
be
the
least
remedy
applied
to
a
--
not
to
aggravate
then
necessitate
for
the
remedy
applies
here.
and
it
would
be
an
affirmative
burden
even
if
these
apply
to
an
exhibitor
under
the
most
liberal
interpretation
to
prove
that
the
adult
was
a
parent.
we
think
all
of
these
places
and
own
us
upon
this
the
right
of
free
speech
which
this
court
would
not
approve.
i
may
say
however,
that
this
isn't
the
basis
upon
which
or
at
least
the
sole
basis
at
all
upon
which
we
stand
here.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
that
would
be
alright
or
even
if
they
couldn't
attend
any
motion
picture
theater
under
a
certain
age
because
then
it
isn't
the
content
of
the
picture
which
is
in
question.
that's
for
the
conduct
and
safety
of
the
child.
we
have
permitted
many
ordinances
which
protect
the
child
as
for
example,
the
case
of
the
jehovah
witnesses
where
this
court
held
that
it
was
the
safety,
the
labor
--
child
labor
provisions
which
interested
this
court.
but
if
you
said,
this
child
as
a
jehovah
witness
cannot
sell
this
particular
pamphlet
because
of
its
content
that
would
be
illegal.
mr.
louis
nizer
right
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
new
york
mr.
justice
fortas,
there
is
such
a
statute
and
you
must
provide
a
matron
before
a
child
can
go
in.
and
the
theaters,
this
is
purely
a
safety
provision
to
provide
such
maintenance
or
they
are
not
admitted.
it
is
as
if
a
book,
if
there's
an
ordinance
or
statute
that
a
bookseller
may
not
sell
books
on
sunday.
if
it
were
just
all
books
on
sunday
that
would
be
legal,
if
he
said
it
couldn't
sell
a
certain
book
on
sunday,
i
think
it
would
be
illegal.
so
that
we
must
distinguish
i
think
between
all
the
ordinances
and
statutes
which
provide
for
the
safety
of
children
which
is
a
desirable
objective
not
infringing
upon
the
free
speech
doctrine.
now,
the
ordinance
provided
that
all
advertisements
and
a
prominent
poster
must
be
put
on
the
box
office
saying,
“not
suitable
for
young
person.”
and
this
dallas
board
was
created
by
an
ordinance
enacted
by
the
dallas
city
council
about
two
years
ago.
and
under
this
ordinance,
it
is
a
crime
to
show
any
motion
picture
in
dallas
unless
it
has
first
been
classified.
now
in
the
instant
case
your
honors,
united
artists
which
is
the
world
distributor
and
also
has
financial
interest
in
this
picture,
we
might
call
it
for
practical
purposes
a
producer
to
license
the
motion
picture
to
the
exhibitor,
interstate
circuit
for
exhibition
at
its
esquire
theater
in
dallas.
as
required
by
the
ordinance,
interstate
with
the
--
filed
with
the
board
its
proposed
classification
suitable
for
young
persons
as
--
and
provided
also
information
on
the
description
of
the
picture
as
it
was
required
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you,
sir.
the
standards
which
this
ordinance
sets
forth
have
in
many
areas
already
been
rejected
by
this
court.
it
might
be
worth
the
moment
to
look
at
the
standards
themselves.
in
determining
that
a
picture
is
not
suitable
for
children,
the
board
must
first
determine
whether
the
picture
describes
or
portrays
brutality,
criminal
violence
or
depravity
or
nudity
or
sexual
promiscuity
or
extramarital
or
abnormal
sex
relations.
second,
if
the
picture
describes
any
of
these
phenomena,
the
board
must
determine
whether
the
portrayal
is
such
that
it
is
likely
“to
insight
or
encourage”
crime
or
delinquency
or
actual
promiscuity
in
the
part
of
the
young
persons.
third,
in
determining
whether
it
is
likely
to
insight
or
encourage
crime,
delinquency
and
so
on,
the
board
must
determine
whether
there
is
in
its
judgment
“a
substantial
probability
that
it
will
create
an
impression
on
young
persons
that
such
conduct
is
profitable,
desirable,
acceptable,
respectable,
trustworthy
and
commonly
accepted.”
now,
identical
of
similar
standards
have
been
condemned
by
this
court
and
other
courts
as
too
vague
to
satisfy
constitutional
guarantees.
for
example,
“sexual
immorality”
people
against
bookcase;
“prejudicial
to
the
best
interest
of
the
people”,
the
gelling
case;
“creating
a
harmful
impression
on
the
minds
of
children”,
paramount
against
chicago
stricken
out;
“sexual
immorality
is
desirable,
acceptable,
or
improper
patterns
of
behavior”,
kingsley
stricken
out,
and
some
of
these
cases
of
course
have
dealt
with
the
protection
of
children.
that
doctrine
that
there
may
be
variable
obscenity
has
never
been
extended
to
mean
that
there
can
be
variable
vagueness
and
this
statute
is
void
and
defective
completely
because
of
vagueness.
just
two
or
three
other
brief
points,
it
has
been
suggested
here
for
the
first
time
that
my
client
united
artist
may
protest
and
has
standing
before
this
court.
that
is
not
so
at
page
128
of
the
record
without
reading
it
subdivision
7,
only
in
exhibitor
may
file
a
notice
of
nonacceptance,
not
a
distributor
and
indeed
the
exhibitors
as
this
court
has
observed
takes
little
to
deter
the
exhibitor
from
going
to
this
kind
of
a
contest
and
that
one
occasion
we've
even
had
to
threaten
to
sue
the
exhibitors
so
we've
filed
as
nonacceptance
so
we
could
get
an
intervening
application.
second,
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
none
at
all.
and
we
have
protested
against
them
in
many
instances
and
we
have
no
standing
before
the
board.
mr.
louis
nizer
in
very
few,
if
any
though
i
have
not
the
statistics
before
me
but
i
will
go
further
mr.
justice
white.
the
exhibitor
has
yielded
against
his
will
in
these
matters.
there
is
this
matter
of
fighting
the
authorities
of
a
community
in
which
you
live
and
depend
upon
the
good
will
of
it
and
this
very
existence
of
this
ordinance
is
itself
a
suppression.
there
would
not
have
been
39
overrulings
in
the
exhibitors
who's
finally
saying
this
is
alright
with
me
when
he
submits
a
specific
request
for
a
suitable
classification
and
it's
overruled,
and
he
says
let's
go
along
because
he
doesn't
want
to
spend
the
money
for
counsel
to
come
up
here.
one
other
observation
about
the
freedman
case
which
i
think
we
owe
to
your
honor,
a
candid
statement
about
it.
we
don't
think
that
the
freedman
case
has
been
complied
within
consequently,
this
statute
is
void
in
any
event
in
this
application
to
the
reasons
i
have
given
that
you
can
have
a
complete
final
determination
without
any
judicial
participation
here.
but
i
would
--
i
think
we
owe
to
this
court
to
be
candid
to
say
that
the
motion
picture
industry
has
never
been
able
to
adjust
itself
to
the
proposition
that
while
other
medias
such
as
magazines,
newspapers,
television
even
comic
books
may
not
be
restrained
by
prior
consideration,
prior
submission
that
we
cannot
share
that
sunshine
and
that
we
stand
in
the
shadow
of
a
five
to
four
decision
which
says
that
we
alone,
the
motion
picture
industry
comes
into
a
special
category.
we
would
therefore
respectfully
suggest
now
that
this
has
demonstrated
the
ineffectualness
of
the
freedman
case
in
attempting
to
modify
the
effects
of
the
times
case
that
if
we
went
on
the
cause
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
the
times
case
was
five
to
four.
that's
the
one
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
not
that.
the
times
case
which
puts
the
motion
picture
industry
in
the
special
category
was
and
i
merely
observed
that
i
think
while
the
freedman
case
was
an
admirable
effort
to
avoid
the
abuse
by
these
judicial
requirements
that
nevertheless
it
hasn't
worked.
well,
here
we
are
on
viva
maria,
if
your
honor
if
you
see
that
picture
you'll
be
shock
that
this
picture
could
be
caught
in
that
kind
of
a
net
when
it
was
intended
for
something
else
and
next
day
it
will
be
something
else
and
then
it
will
be
as
i've
indicated
a
proliferation
of
these
ordinances.
i
wish
to
observe
that
while
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
there's
no
salary
to
these
people,
that
in
most
of
these
proposals,
they
not
only
receives
salaries
but
there
is
a
fee
for
submitting
the
picture
for
their
examination
and
you
get
the
entire
bureaucracy
imposed
upon
this.
and
i
think
that
this
will
cause
a
great
flood
of
this
kind
of
case
whereas
if
we
--
if
in
dealing
with
this
difficult
question,
if
we
subjected
the
restraint
to
at
least
to
penal
provisions
or
at
most
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
with
all
the
safeguards
for
a
defendant
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
then
i
think
this
perhaps
might
be
held
in
control.
and
the
penal
statute
would
get
after
the
man
that
should
get
after
some
case
where
somebody
is
really
trying
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
sensibilities
of
the
american
people.
this
is
not
this
case
at
all.
it
doesn't
even
come
up
on
obscenity.
