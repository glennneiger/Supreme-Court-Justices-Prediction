chief

how
many
did
you
say

did
you
say
they
had
reviewed
in

chief

beg
your

chief

in

chief

so
they
have
--
they
have
actually
sat
through
1900
of
those
of
pictures,
is
that
correct?
chief

well,
how
they
--
how
do
they
pass
on

if
they
haven't
seen
them?
chief

do
they've
got
larger

where
they

not

chief

well,
do
they
get
--
do
the
motion

operators
get
bigger
crowds
when
they
say
this
is
not
suitable
for
children.
chief
justice

we'll

chief

suppose
it'd
be
in
a
nature
of
truancy,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
had
there
have
been
no
prosecution
of
any
kind
under
this
ordinance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bickley,
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
isn't
--
but
then
the
situation
where
neither
the
board
nor
the
court
makes
any
findings.
now,
i
suppose
you
have
four
of
your
board
members
think
that
one
scene
in
the
picture
takes
it
and
the
other
five
of
it,
don't
think
that
one
does
but
they
do
think
another
scene
affects
it,
but
they
just
put
them
together
and
say,
“well,
it's
bad”.
and
then
they
go
to
the
court
and
the
court
thinks
well
maybe
the
first
one
is
alright,
but
the
second
one
is
wrong.
now,
has
the
court
passed
on
anything
that
we
should
reach?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
that,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
basis
for
us
determining
whether
they
acted
rationally
or
lawfully
in
what
they
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
it
comes
to
us?
what
--
what
is
it
we
act
upon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
guessed
from
--
from
what
the
trial
court
decided
and
the
board
decided
made
it
bad?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
without
any
findings
in
the
courts
below
to
support
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
are
the
limitations
on
the
board
then
in
determining
what
is
good
for
children
and
what
isn't?
if
obscenity
isn't
the
test,
obscenity
as
it
applies
to
children
is
not
the
test,
what
test
is
there
for
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
answer
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
you
have
mustered,
that's
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl

confined
within
the
