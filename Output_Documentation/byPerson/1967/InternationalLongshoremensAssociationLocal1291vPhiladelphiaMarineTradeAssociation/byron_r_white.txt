justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you're
really
saying
though
is
you
just
might
as
well
forget
whatever
arbitrator's
award
because
here,
we
have
a
new
dispute
and
all
these
amounts
to
is
enjoining
a
work
stoppage
contrary
to
a
provision
of
the
contract.
that's
all
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
you?
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
if
that
makes
the
pure
sinclair
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly,
if
you
are
right,
this
later
dispute
has
no
connection
with
the
earlier
arbitration
award.
and
then
that's
all
it
is.
it's
a
pure
sinclair
case.
the
thing
that
may
make
this
different
is
that
if
there
is
an
arbitrator's
award,
what
really
applies
to
this
union
conduct
then
the
argument
is
that
it
should
be
able
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award
even
if
it
involved
enjoining
a
work
stoppage.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
the
arbitrator's
award
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
arbitrator's
award
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
this
weather
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
qualified
by
any
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
employer
had
a
right
to
put
over
on
one-hour
guarantee
and
four
hours
in
the
afternoon?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
perfectly
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
situation
that
the
employer
by
7:30
in
the
morning
may
put
over.
and
that's
a
perfectly
clear
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
idea
was
that
union
should
be
bound
by
that
contract
as
so
construed.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
union
was
being
--
do
you
think
the
union
living
up
to
the
contract
if
it
struck
--
i
mean
that
the
contract
meant
something
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
at
7:30
in
the
morning
that
the
employer
says,
“we're
putting
you
over
to
1
o'clock
and
you
have
five
hours
guaranteed
for
the
day.”
and
the
union
says,
“sorry,
we
got
to
have
eight
hours;
we're
striking.”
now,
the
union
living
up
with
the
contract
after
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
after
that
arbitration
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
what's
unclear
about
saying,
“i
hereby
enforce
the
award”
and
what's
unclear
about
holding
that
a
strike
in
that
situation
is
covered
by
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
doubt
now
that
that
strike
was
covered
by
that
--
is
a
breach
of
contract
contrary
to
the
award.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
you
asked
the
judge
does
it
cover
work
stoppages.
well
i
just
asked
you,
you
said
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
but
you
could
have
--
that
isn't
related
to
the
question
you
asked
the
judge
and
the
question
i
asked
you.
is
the
work
stoppage
contrary
to
the
meaning
of
the
contract
a
violation
of
the
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
freedman,
could
you
say
that
after
the
arbitrator's
award
that
the
union
struck
when
they
were
put
over
the
next
time
that
they
could
be
sued
for
breach
of
contract
and
get
them
and
be
held
for
damages.
now,
a
while
ago,
you
said
absolutely
that's
a
breach
of
the
award.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
after
the
award
which
construed
the
contract
and
said
that
you
can
put
them
over
under
any
circumstances
that
they
struck
when
they
were
put
over
the
next
time,
wouldn't
you
say
they've
breached
the
contract
and
that
they
could
be
held
liable
in
damages
even
if
they
couldn't
be
enjoined?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
arbitrators
already
said
that
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
already
said
that
this
clause
stands
on
its
own
two
feet.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
--
you're
really
not
arguing
in
this
case
much
about
the
fact
that
this
is
an
injunction
case.
you
would
make
the
same
argument
when
it
was
a
damages
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
mr.
justice
brennan
has
been
suggesting.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
sinclair
said
that
that
order
--
such
an
order
was
not
an
injunction
or
just
that
it
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
but
the
order
enforcing
arbitration,
the
order
to
arbitrate
--
order
to
arbitrate
with
sinclair
said
it
could
be
entered.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
said
that
--
it
didn't
say
it
was
an
injunction.
it
said
that
it
wasn't
a
kind
of
conduct
which
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
applied
here,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
freedman,
what
if
you
enact
in
the
sinclair
case
--
forget
sinclair
for
a
little
bit.
let's
assume
there
is
an
order
to
arbitrate.
the
union
refuses
to
arbitrate
and
there's
an
order
issued
against
it
to
arbitrate
as
the
contract
require
and
the
union
goes
ahead
to
arbitration
but
strikes
the
same
time.
may
the
strike
be
enjoined?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
don't
you
think
the
union
contract
says
we
will
arbitrate
disputes.
the
union,
as
a
piece
of
collective
action
refuses
to
arbitrate
and
the
court
orders
it
to
arbitrate
and
to
comply
with
the
contract,
isn't
that
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
really
say
then
that
the
order
to
arbitrate
--
the
order
--
the
order
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award,
you
do
not
really
claim
that
as
--
that
the
court
can't
enter
that.
you
just
really
say
that
that
order
can't
be
construed
to
cover
the
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
be
held
in
contempt
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
orders
to
enforce
award
are
just
a
nullity.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they
can
enter
them
and
they
are
injunctions.
that's
true
but
this
so
is
an
order
to
arbitrate,
they're
just
nullities.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
not
cross
anybody's
mind
if
they
just
entered
the
order
to
arbitrate
but
it's
a
nullity
of
the
union
to
strike,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
that
order.
you
can't
sue
for
damages,
can
you,
to
enforce
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
sue
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
--
could
the
court
enter
an
order
of
civil
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
everyday
of
strike
you
pay
$20?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
say
the
union
could
be
sued
for
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
the
order
enforcing
the
award
really
is
a
nullity
that
you
can't
even
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
might
as
well
say
that
the
orders
enforcing
awards
are
out
the
window.you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
judge
ought
to
say
to
the
employer
comes
in
to
or
the
union
for
that
matter
wants
to
come
in
and
enforce
an
award,
“forget
it
because
it
won't
do
me
any
good
to
enter
an
order
because
i
can
enforce
it
either
by
civil
contempt
or
in
any
other
way
and
you
just
or
we
admitted
to
a
suit
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
say
there
shouldn't
be
any
actions
to
enforcing
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you're
really
saying
though
is
you
just
might
as
well
forget
whatever
arbitrator's
award
because
here,
we
have
a

and
all
these
amounts
to
is

that's

it

why
shouldn't
you?
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
if
that
makes
the
pure

justice

well,

by

that

so
that

had

after
