mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
next
one
are
related
and
grow
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts.
i
might
characterize
the
first
case
as
the
injunction
action
and
the
second
as
the
contempt
case.
and
since
they
both
involved
and
grow
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts,
i
think,
i
would
like
to
review
the
basic
facts
first,
so
that
when
i
get
to
the
second
case,
i
need
only
go
right
into
the
legal
aspects
of
it
without
again
reviewing
the
factual
picture.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that
would
be
entirely
satisfactory
with
me,
if
your
honors.(voice
overlap)
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
your
honors.
i
think
that
would
simplify
matters
a
great
deal.
the
basic
questions,
your
honor,
on
the
first
case
the
so-called
“injunction
case”
as
i
have
outlined
that
characterized
it,
is
does
a
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
union
from
a
work
stoppage
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
under
the
guise
of
an
order
for
a
specific
performance
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award.
this
is
the
basic.
this
is
one
of
the
basics
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
perhaps
i
didn't
want
to
go
that
far
on
my
characterization
and
i
would
not
impute
any
impropriety
or
anything
of
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
not
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
a
basic
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
except,
your
honor,
there
is
this
much
about
it.
and
the
reason
i
used
the
expression
was
this.
in
the
first
instance,
we
relied
on
your
honor's
decision
in
the
sinclair
case
which
we
thought
met
the
basic
issues
squarely.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honors,
an
integral
part
of
this
court
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
we
would
all
defend
your
honor's
right
to
dissent.
i
think
that
even
under
your
honor's
opinion,
and
i
think
that
reading
your
honor's
opinion
and
taking
the
majority
decision,
the
distinction
which
is
made
here
by
the
court
below
could
not
stand
up
even
under
your
honor's
dissent
in
the
sinclair
case.
that's
why
i
used
the
word,
“under
the
guise
of”
because
in
the
other
case
we
met
the
issues
squarely.
the
issue
--
this
court
met
the
issue
squarely.
can
you
enter
an
order
restraining
a
labor
dispute?
can
this
--
can
any
federal
court
enter
an
order
restraining
a
work
stoppage
or
publicity
or
any
of
the
other
things
which
are
protected
by
the
norris-laguardia
act.
this
was
meeting
the
issue
squarely.
in
this
case,
the
issue
was
raised
while
--
“does
it
make
any
difference?”
the
court
below
said,
“well,
we're
not
really
restraining
a
work
stoppage,
we're
not
really
doing
any
of
the
other
things
which
involved
the
protective
activity.
what
we're
doing
here
is
simply
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award."
and
we
say
and
i
think
that
we
can
demonstrate
your
honor
that
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
and
therefore,
this
is
why
we
used
the
word
“under
the
guise
of”
and
i
think
that
even
under,
as
i
said
before,
under
your
honor's
dissenting
opinion,
that
distinction
could
not
be
tenable.
that
is
the
first,
that
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
if
your
honors
should
resolve
that
issue
as
your
honors
did
in
the
sinclair
in
favor
of
the
union
here,
then
everything
else
would
fall
away
because
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
below
to
entertain
any
of
the
other
problems.
again,
in
the
--
another
question,
the
second
question
may
be
broken
down
but
i'll
try
to
put
it
all
in
one
question,
involved
in
the
so-called
injunction
aspect
of
the
cases,
was
it
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
retain
jurisdiction,
assuming
that
he
had
it
in
the
first
place
of
a
case
admittedly
moot
just
in
case
something
might
happen
at
some
future
time,
and
thereafter,
when
another
dispute
unrelated
to
the
first
one
arose,
they
held
the
hearing
on
an
ex
parte
report
of
one
of
the
parties,
an
ex
parte
report
of
one
of
the
parties
without
any
formal
pleading,
without
setting
forth
on
record
any
new
complaint
or
any
amended
complaint
under
dispute.
and
without
requiring
any
newer
amended
complaint,
pleading
the
new
dispute
and
then
enter
an
innocuous
order
which
he
refused
to
explain
or
clarify
in
anyway
in
violation
of
rules
52
and
65(d)
--
rules
52(a)
and
65(d).
these
are
the
two
basic
questions
which
are
related
to
the
first
injunction
aspect
of
the
case,
your
honors.
now,
with
respect
to
the
basic
facts,
ila,
the
international
longshoremen's
association
is
in
contractual
relationship
with
pmta,
the
philadelphia
marine
trade
association
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
the
philadelphia
waterfront.
there
are
just
a
few
aspects
of
that
agreement
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honor's
attention.
just
i
think
four
possibly
five
points
--
five
provisions.
i
might
say
at
the
outset
that
one
of
the
major
provisions
in
this
contract
was
what
they
call
“the
day
before
hiring”.
previously,
they
would
hire
the
same
day
in
the
morning
and
the
man
would
not
know
whether
they
had
any
work
until
they
appeared
at
the
shape
up
of
18
different
points
along
the
waterfront
and
when
they
were
hired
that
day,
then
they
knew
they
had
hired
them,
they
would
have
certain
guarantees
so
that
they
couldn't
be
knocked
off
for
any
reason
except
those
specifically
outlined
in
the
agreement.
under
this
agreement
now,
they
had
to
be
told
the
day
before.
they
have
to
be
hired
that
day
before
for
work
commencing
the
next
day
and
it
might
be
during
the
period
of
the
--
during
the
top
period
that
the
ship
is
in.
in
any
event,
this
is
what
they
call
the
day
before
hiring.
this
hiring
is
not
done
at
the
hiring
center.
this
might
be
an
important
factor
your
honors
will
determine
later.
it
is
not
done
at
the
hiring
center.
these
men
are
advised
by
their
particular
foreman
the
day
before
and
they
appeared.
now,
one
of
the
key
provisions
involved
in
this
argument
is
the
provision
entitled
10(6).
this
is
the
section
10(6)
that
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
of
number
34
on
page
7
which
provides
what
they
call
a
“set-back
clause”
and
it
simply
gives
the
employer
the
right
to
postpone
the
start
of
work
from
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
men
get
a
one
hour
guarantee
for
the
morning's
work
which
they
missed.
another
provision
under
this
contract
is
section
9(h)
which
provides
that
when
the
men
are
not
put
to
work
because
of
inclement
weather,
then
they
must
be
given
the
four-hour
guarantee
for
the
morning.
the
difference
here
is
whether
or
not
the
one
hour
guarantee,
the
employers
here,
tend
to
assert
the
--
and
did
assert
the
section
10(6)
and
try
to
give
them
under
one
hour
guarantee
instead
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause
even
though
the
men
were
knocked
off
or
not
put
to
work
because
of
inclement
weather.
and
then
the
last
provision
that
i
would
note
to
your
honors'
attention
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
number
28
which
relates
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
and
this
provides
that
all
disputes
and
this
say,
i'm
quoting
the
language
now,
all
disputes
of
whatever
nature
or
kind
must
be
submitted
to
arbitration,
including
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
and
so
on.
it's
a
very
broad
clause
and
all
disputes.
and
i
may
say
that
under
this
clause,
and
under
this
particular
clause
and
under
the
practice
of
the
industry,
whenever
a
dispute
arose
and
that
was
sent
to
arbitration,
if
another
dispute
arose
involving
even
the
same
issue,
the
parties
did
have
the
right
and
in
fact
exercise
it
and
went
to
the
arbitrator
again.
there
may
be
some,
might
be
some
distinction
between
the
first
dispute
and
the
second
dispute.
but
in
any
event,
both
parties
always
exercise
the
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
as
many
times
as
they
wanted
and
i
may
say
that
previously,
and
i
cited
in
my
brief,
when
the
father
comey
was
the
arbitrator
on
the
philadelphia
waterfront,
he
--
the
same
issue,
i
think
it
was
under
14(d),
which
is
so-called
--
involving
the
introduction
of
the
so-called
“technological
advances”
into
the
waterfront.
father
comey
had
ruled
on
these
four
occasions
that
the
issue
was
not
arbitrable
and
on
each
occassion,
he
interpreted
this
section
14(d)
to
mean
that
this
was
a
matter
for
negotiation
of
the
parties
and
it
was
not
arbitrable
because
it
was
under
the
provisions
of
this
agreement.
it
involved
a
technological
advancement
and
therefore,
it
had
to
be
negotiated
and
not
arbitrated.
the
fifth
time,
the
same
kind
of
a
dispute
under
the
same
provision
of
the
agreement
came
before
father
comey.
he
again
refuted
and
said,
“well,
it's
only
human
to
err”
and
he
reversed
himself.
there
was
some
question.
my
friend
raises
the
question
and
says
that
he
didn't
really
reverse
himself.
i
think
he
did
the
arbitration
whether
there's
evidence
but
that
doesn't
matter.
the
point
is
that
he
received
the
same
dispute
and
the
same
clause
and
he
interpreted
the
same
clause
five
times.
the
first
four
times
uniformly;
the
fifth
time
he
reversed
himself.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
throughout,
even
though
the
same
issue
was
involved,
the
parties
had
the
right
to
go
to
arbitration
and
that
the
arbitrator
say
whether
(a)
if
it
is
the
same
dispute;
(b)
whether
he
still
wants
to
follow
the
same
decision
that
has
been
rendered
before
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
clause.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
is
in
the
port
of
philadelphia.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they're
covering
the
entire
fort
of
philadelphia.
this
is
a
provision,
a
contract
peculiar
to
the
port
of
philadelphia
which
embraces
both
sides
of
the
river
and
extend
down
the
river
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
one
agreement
covering
the
long
tract
of
the
entire
waterfront.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
it
just
couldn't
work
out
that
way.
first
of
all,
each
dispute
stands
on
its
own
two
feet.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sorry.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
court
order
is
one
of
the
things
that's
involved
in
this
case
your
honor
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
let
me
perhaps
break
it
down
now.
i
was
going
to
cover
this
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
point
to
break
it
up.
in
other
words,
we
had
one
dispute
where
the
employer
knocked
the
men
off
or
told
them
to
change
the
starting
time
from
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
he
is
supposed
to
do
that
by
7:30
in
the
morning.
so
the
contract
reads.
this
went
to
arbitration.
the
union
claims
that
it
was
governed
by
the
provisions
of
9(h),
which
relate
--
which
was
the
inclement
weather
clause.
the
men
were
changed
from
8:00
to
1:00
because
the
weather
was
inclement.
the
union
claimed
that
the
inclement
weather
clause
applied.
the
employer's
claim
that
section
10(6)
applied
which
they
said
was
unqualified.
so
they
went
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
handed
down
as
award
holding
that
section
10(6)
standing
by
itself
was
very
clear
and
it
must
not
be
construed
against
--
in
the
light
of
anything
else
in
the
agreement.
he
did
not
consider
9(h),
the
inclement
weather
clause
did
not
give
the
union
a
full
opportunity.
i
may
say
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
and
that
was
a
long
joint
out
hearing
too.
we
were
quite
surprise.
i
think
both
my
friend
and
myself
was
surprised
when
he
said
he
didn't
want
to
hear
argument,
he
didn't
want
have
briefs
so
that
we
could
sum
up
from
the
evidence
which
had
been
made.
in
any
event,
he
ruled
that
section
10(6)
of
the
agreement
was
an
unqualified
provision
which
said
that
the
employers
could
not
demand
the
offer,
could
postpone
the
employment
time
with
only
one
hour
guarantee
for
the
morning
instead
of
the
four-hour
inclement
weather
guarantee.
now,
the
next
time
a
dispute
arose
and
i
was
going
to
cover
this
specifically,
that
was
the
first
dispute
and
he
handed
that
down
in
connection
with
the
dispute
which
arose
on
april
in
1965.
about
two
or
three
months
later,
another
dispute
arose
and
men
knocked
off
in
this
--
and
each
one
of
these
instances,
they
were
knocked
off
because
the
men
--
one
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
they
thought
they
were
entitledto
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause
and
the
union
again
wanted
to
go
to
arbitration.
i
think
this
brings
up
your
focuses,
attention
immediately
on
the
point
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
and
that
is,
could
we
again
go
to
arbitration?
now,
just
as
the
employers
--
one
that
had
do
it
and
did
in
fact
do
it
in
other
--
in
connection
with
14(d)
when
new
advances
were
brought
in
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
new
piece
of
machinery
and
whether
the
clause
should
be
construed
for
arbitration
or
negotiation.
the
point
is
that
the
arbitrator
took
it
and
upon
his
--
followed
that
procedure.
now,
between
the
time
of
the
first
dispute,
your
honor,
and
the
time
of
the
last
one
which
was
about
10
months,
the
employers
invoked
this
clause
71
times;
71
times.
there
were
four
occasions,
however,
when
there
were
work
stoppages.
the
first
time,
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
work
stoppage
but
the
remaining
three
did
result
in
work
stoppages.
now,
when
your
honor
says
that
well,
they
could
do
it
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
day,
your
honor,
i
think
overlooks
the
fact
that
each
of
these
disputes
is
based
on
a
separate
set
of
facts.
it
may
involve
the
same
principle
or
it
may
not.
it
may
involve
a
qualification
of
that
principle.
but
whether
or
not
it
involves
the
same
principle,
there's
something
which
both
parties
have
a
right
to
test
just
as
this
court
has
even
in
the
past
reversed
itself
perhaps
not
frequently
but
it
has,
but
at
least,
the
parties
do
have
the
right
even
if
a
sort
--
that
this
court
should
hand
down
a
decision
on
a
particular
case.
well,
let's
take
mahnich
versus
southern
transportation
company
where
the
court
handed
down
--
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
and
handed
down
and
set
forth
the
principle
of
law.
later
on,
a
plaintiff
went
to
court
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
i
would
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
even
if
it
was
the
identical
issue,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
man
should
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
say,
i
think
you
were
wrong
before.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
precipitated
this
whole
conflict.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
was
a
big
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
only
a
part
of
it,
your
honor.
perhaps
they
answer
that
this
way.
ila
in
each
case,
when
a
dispute
arose
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
contempt
order
was
based
on
the
--
of
course
your
honor
is
correct
there.
the
contempt
order
is
based
on
the
work
stoppage
itself.
but
inherent
to
the
whole
question
is
the
fact
that
in
each
instance,
when
the
dispute
arose
after
the
first
dispute,
after
the
arbitration
was
decided,
and
the
arbitrator
have
gone
to
this
award
and
the
second
dispute
arose,
ila
at
that
time
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
arbitrator
again
to
have
an
arbitrator,
and
have
at
least
the
dispute
arbitrated.
the
arbitrator
could
have
said,
“i
agree
with
the
same
thing”.
i
adhere
to
my
ruling
the
same
as
father
comey
had
said
four
times
and
the
fifth
time
reversed
himself
or
he
could
have
said
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
a
difference.
now,
instead
of
the
employers
here
blocked
the
union
from
going
to
arbitration
by
bringing
this
lawsuit
before
judge
body
and
judge
body
at
that
time
took
jurisdiction
and
wouldn't
let
go.
and
very
effectively,
he
blocked
the
union
from
going
to
arbitration
throughout.
now,
well,
that
may
not
be
an
issue
in
this
case
directly.
it
is
related
as
part
of
the
overall
picture.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no.
on
the
contrary
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
might
do
it,
your
honor,
but
i
can't
go
that
far.
i
say
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
no
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
basic
facts,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
before,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
work
stoppage,
whether
or
not
the
court's
order
restrained
the
work
stoppage.
what
we
are
talking
about
now
is
a
related
problem
which
precipitated
the
conflict.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
this
is
a
pure
sinclair
case.
there's
no
question
about
it
to
my
mind.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
didn't
quite
get
your
point
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
we
can't
get
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
you're
right.
i
think
that
we
can
without
going
into
the
fact,
very
well,
sir.
let
me
get
right
into
it.
the
court
entered
--
entered
this
as
i
have
characterized
it,
a
very
innocuous
order
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
without
any
preliminary
pleadings,
without
any
of
the
other
safeguards
which
are
required
by
rules
3
and
4
and
rule
8
of
the
civil
rules
--
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
on
the
third
dispute,
judge
body
entered
an
order
in
which
he
said,
“the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.”
this
is
the
whole
order.
now,
what
was
the
order?
the
order,
in
effect
was
that
the
one-hour
guarantee
shall
be
given
instead
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause.
there
was
no
order
by
the
arbitrator
requiring
the
men
to
return
to
work
and
when
he
simply
said
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced,
we
could
argue
that
on
some
other
case.
but
the
point
is
what
did
it
mean?
did
it
mean
that
there
was
a
work
stoppage
being
restrained?
did
it
mean
that
he
union
could
not
go
to
arbitration
again?
and
i
may
say
that
on
page
7
of
my
brief
--
7
and
then
the
footnotes
on
page
8
too
--
a
footnote
on
7
and
on
8,
your
honors
will
find
an
incredible
exchange
least
i
thought
it
was
incredible,
between
the
court
and
myself.
he
says,“you
can
read
the
english
language,
can't
you?”
all
that
it
said
was
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.
this
was
later
construed
to
be
an
injunction
or
a
restraining
order
and
yet,
it
just
simply
used
those
three
words.
no
fact
findings
as
required
by
rule
52(a)
and
all
non-jury
cases
have
certainly
no
fact
finding
or
anything
which
was
required
under
rule
64(d),
65(d),
which
relates
to
restraining
orders
or
injunctions.
so
i
asked
them
to
please
explain
it
and
here's
what
he
said
to
the
court,
“i
will
sign
this
order.”
that
was
the
order.
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.
that's
the
works.
by
mr.
freedman,
“well,
what
does
it
mean,
your
honor?”
the
court,
“that
you
will
have
to
determine
what
it
means."
and
before
i
go
further,
the
rule
is
specific
with
respect
to
injunctions
if
it's
going
to
be
a
restraining
order.
the
parties
got
a
right
to
know.
the
rule
specifically
says,
you
got
to
tell
him
specifically
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
can't
do.
and
here's
what
the
further
colloquy
shows.
the
court,
“that
you
will
have
to
determine
what
it
means.”
mr.
freedman,
“well,
i'm
asking.
i
have
to
give
my
client
advice
and
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
i'm
asking
your
honor
to
tell
me
what
it
means.
it
doesn't”
--
the
court,
“you
handle
the
case.you
know
about
it.
you
are
arguing
it.
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
case.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“i'm
telling
you
very
frankly
now.
i
don't
know
what
this
order
means,
this
proposed
order.
it
says
'enforcement
of
the
award'.
now,
just
what
doesn't
mean.
are
we
being
restrained
from
the
work
stoppage?”
the
court,
“the
court
has
acted.
this
is
the
order.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“well,
won't
your
honor
tell
me
what
it
means?”
the
court,
“you
read
the
english
language
and
i
do.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“i
will
ask
you
but
it
doesn't
say
it.
i
can't
understand
it.
i'm
telling
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
it.
now,
perhaps,
your
honor
can
explain
it
to
me
that
this
means
that
the
union
cannot
engage
in
a
strike
or
refuse
to
work
or
picket?”
the
court,
“you
know
what
the
arbitration
was
about.
you
know
the
result
of
the
arbitration.”
mr.
freedman,
“your
arbitration
here
was
under
a
specific
set
of
facts
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
under
a
specific
set
of
facts
and
he
made
that
interpretation.
now,
how
do
you
enforce
it?
the
case
is
over
and
done
with.
that
case
is
over
and
done
with.
these
are
new
cases.
your
honor
is
changing
the
contract
to
the
parties
when
you
foreclosed
them
from
going
to
arbitration
on
this
point
again.”
the
court,
“i
have
signed
the
order.
anything
else
to
came
before
us.”
mr.
freedman,
“i
know,
but
your
honor
is
leaving
me
in
the
sky.
i
don't
know
what
to
say
to
my
client.”
now,
that
was
precisely
the
situation.
that
in
the
face
of
rule
65(d)
which
says
that
when
you
got
a
restraining
order,
if
it
was
in
fact
a
restraining
order,
it's
got
to
spell
out
specifically
the
conduct
which
you
can
do,
which
you
cannot
do
so
that
the
defendant
doesn't
get
trapped
in
any
kind
of
situation.
and
here,
the
court
just
threw
away
the
rule
book.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir,
if
it
was
a
restraining
order
or
if
it
was
an
injunction.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
subsequently
construed
it
as
a
restraining
order
or
an
order
restraining
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
arbitrator's
award
said,
“i
hold
that
rule
10(6),
section
10(6)
is
not
qualified
and
i
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
he
didn't
even
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
qualified
but
he
said
qualified
by
standing
by
itself.
he
refused
to
construe
it
in
the
light
of
any
other
provision
agreement.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
what
he
held,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
that's
correct,
absolutely
right.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
said,
in
that
case
under
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
union
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
absolutely
not.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
contract.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
the
arbitrator
here
simply
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
gave
a
set
of
facts
which
clearly
spelled
out
a
violation
of
the
contract
by
the
union
and
i
would
clearly
admit
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
asked
me
if
the
union
would
be
in
violation
of
the
contract,
if
there
was
a
--
if
the
arbitrator
covered
as
did
--
as
he
did
here.
he
was
construing
the
contract,
no
question
about
it.
but
he
was
construing
it
under
specific
set
of
facts
in
a
particular
dispute.
i
may
say
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
i
was
concerned
that
what
your
honor
was
talking
about
now
might
have
been
in
the
judge's
mind.
i
was
concerned
about
that
very
point
that's
why
i
asked
him.
does
the
order
restrain
a
work
stoppage?
i
wasn't
sure
by
any
means.
i
was
also
concerned,
your
honor,
that
we
could
not
go
to
arbitration
again
on
any
manner
which
might
even
remotely
resolve
the
situation
even
though
i
thought
we
had
a
right
to
do
it
and
so
i
asked
him
those
questions.
now,
i
have
a
right
to
know
when
rule
65(d)
spells
that
out
very
specifically
that
he's
got
to
set
it
forth
--
he's
going
to
set
forth
what
we
can
do
and
what
we
can't
do.
now,
the
best
that
you
can
give
to
this
is
that
you
have
to
guess
what
it
means.
you
have
to
guess
it
what
he
means.
now,
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
under
these
circumstances
in
this
case,
just
giving
expression
to
rule
10(6)
of
the
agreement,
the
employers
can't
change
it
but
how
about
9(h)?
he
didn't
--
the
arbitrator
didn't
say
a
word
about
9(h)
and
the
union
came
in
here
and
one
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
9(h)
but
he
didn't
say
anything
on
9(h).
now
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
very
well,
sir.
i
think
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
though
on
that
point
to
leave
it
that
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
clearly
in
error
in
failing
to
spell
out
what
he
had
in
mind
especially
if
there
was
any
confusion
in
my
mind
i
had
a
right
to
know.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
and
52(a)
also
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
it
is
self-executing
but
i
think
that
we
can
also
show
prejudice,
how
much
prejudice
that
he's
practically
putting
the
union
out
of
business
with
the
order
which
he
subsequent
--
which
he
himself
subsequently
construed
to
be
a
restraining
order.
i
might
say
your
honor,
just
before
i
leave
that
subject
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
i
argued
this
case,
one
of
the
judges
said,
he
doesn't
mean
a
restraining
order.
what
he
said
is
just
enforcing
the
award.
that's
not
a
restraining
order.
it
doesn't
say
he's
restraining
any
work
stoppage.
this
is
what
was
said
to
me
and
i
said
i
can't
tell.
at
least
i
was
entitled
to
as
a
clear
explanation
from
the
court
as
to
what
he
meant.
and
if
he
meant
to
restrain
it,
i
think
he
had
a
duty
to
say
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
what
he
should
have
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
didn't
say
and
wouldn't
say
whether
or
not
it
restrained
any
work
stoppage,
whether
it
restrained
picketing,
whether
or
not
it
restrained
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
arbitrator's
award
--
your
honor,
the
arbitrator's
award
could
mean
a
lot
of
things.
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
any
doubt
about
it
at
all.
and
i,
as
counsel,
had
great
doubt
in
my
mind
about
what
it
meant.
i
know
that
he
probably
have
in
his
mind
a
restraining
order
against
the
strike
or
whatever
it
was
but
i
think
you
should
have
said
and
i
wasn't
sure.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
i
had
a
great
doubt
in
my
mind
whether
he
meant
by
that
that
if
you
don't
abide
that
this
award
means
that
you
can
strike
in
connection
with
that,
that
the
men
can't
picket,
the
man
can't
engage
in
any
work
stoppage.
also,
i
was
concerned
that
this
particular
expression
which
he
used
restrained
us
from
going
to
arbitration
again
on
the
same
point
by
the
same
principle
in
any
other
dispute.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
preventative
for
what,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
arbitrator
were
to
hold
that
a
work
stoppage
under
these
circumstances
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract,
i
would
say
that
the
--
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
admit
that
the
union
would
be
violating
the
agreement
if
it
did
so.
if
the
arbitrator
would
say
so,
we
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
ask
him
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
your
honor
that
your
honor's
posing
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
change
in
parties
may
have
something
to
do
with
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
order
itself,
your
honor,
did
not
restrain
a
work
stoppage.
the
order
itself
did
not.
so
when
you
enforce
a
work
stoppage
or
that
the
order
did
was
to
say
that
the
manner
entitled
only
to
one
hour
instead
of
four
hours.
that's
the
effect
of
the
order.
now,
when
you
enforce
that
order,
it
means
that
in
that
dispute
on
april
25th,
the
men
couldn't
get
their
four
hours.
they
can
only
get
one
hour.
there
was
no
work
stoppage
involved.
now,
when
we
enforce
that
order,
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
that
we
have
to
extend
and
we
have
to
reason
and
argue
that
from
that,
in
the
future,
if
we
engage
in
that
again
there
would
be
--
the
arbitrator
would
hand
down
a
decision
saying
“you've
got
to
go
back
to
work”.
all
he
did
was
decide
that
the
men
were
only
entitled
to
one
hour
instead
of
four
hours.
that's
what
he
decided.
there
was
no
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
men
should
go
back
to
work.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
is
absolutely
governed.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
an
injunction,
as
subsequent
development
showed,
an
injunction
against
the
work
stoppage,
a
violation
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
arbitrator's
award
has
already
carried
out.
the
men
didn't
get
their
four
hours.
they
get
one
hour
and
nobody
went
on
to
dispute
about
that
so
that
so
far
as
that
award
was
concerned,
it
was
done
and
over
with.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
dispute
arose,
there
would
be
another
question
of
whether
it
should
be
four
hours
or
one
hour.
what
the
union
wanted
to
do
is
to
have
the
arbitrator
pass
and
determine
the
validity
of
section
9(h)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
the
union
struck
and
it
was
found
that
they
violated
the
agreement,
they
could
be
sued
for
damages.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
could
have
–-
but
your
honor's
relating
that
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
they
could
sue
us
for
damages
but
i
don't
think
that
they
could
prevail.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
because
the
arbitrator's
award
would
then
have
to
be
an
issue
then
we
would
make
that
--
we
would
not
have
to
accept
the
arbitrator's
judgment.
he
would
have
to
approve
whoever
came
in
the
court
under
those
circumstances,
would
have
to
prove
the
contract
and
then
they
would
have
to
cope
with
rule
98(h),
the
inclement
whether
clause.
it
had
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
right.
he
said
that
this
clause
has
to
be
construed
all
by
itself
without
regard
to
any
other
part
of
the
agreement.
that's
what
the
arbitrator
said.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
may
be
i'd
better
get
right
to
the
sinclair
case.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
know
your
honors
have
been
waiting
for
this
one
too
and
i
certainly
do
want
to
get
to
it.
the
sinclair
case
is
very
similar
except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
sinclair,
there
was
no
arbitration
award
as
such
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there
was
an
award
or
whether
there
was
no
award
if
you
have
in
fact
the
basic
provisions
to
the
agreement.
here
you
have
a
--
in
sinclair
as
here,
you
had
an
arbitration
provision
which
was
final
and
binding,
you
had
a
no-strike
clause
which
was
the
same
as
the
no-strike
clause
that
well,
which
you
can
impute
to
this
contract
also.
there
was
no
real
distinction
between
sinclair
and
in
this
case.
in
sinclair,
your
honors
held
that
although
you
could
have
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award,
you
could
--
it
would
be
enforced
except
to
the
extent
that
it
would
run
afoul
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
in
all
other
aspects,
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
an
appeal,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir
and
sinclair
said
that.
you
can
have
an
order
requiring
the
parties
to
go
arbitration
and
that
did
not
run
into
or
run
afoul
of
the
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
sinclair
said
it
was
an
injunction.
sinclair,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
-–
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
norris-laguardia
act
prohibited.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
although
there
was
no
arbitrator's
award
in
sinclair,
necessarily
however,
that
fact
is
implicit
because
in
order
to
reach
this
decision
--
in
order
to
reach
your
honor's
decision,
you
went
in
to
the
whole
history
of
it,
the
history
which
showed
--
the
legislative
history
which
showed
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
been
superseded
by
the
enactment
of
section
301
of
the
labor
act.
and
your
honors
finally
held
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
all
the
vitality
that
it
had
before
the
enactment
of
section
301.
so
that
we
start
with
a
premise
that
you
can
have
the
enforcement
of
an
award
and
--
oh!
and
that
same
case,
your
honors
held
that
the
--
you
recognized
that
arbitration
was
the
so-called
“kingpin
of
the
federal
labor
policy”.
but
you
said
that
this
court
is
not
the
one
that
forged
it.
that
was
for
congress
to
forge
and
i
might
say
there
that
i
think
that
the
court
below
went
astray
when
they
took
a
part
of
your
honor's
decision
in
the
sinclair
cases,
stopped
right
in
the
middle
where
this
court
was
saying
that
arbitration
is
an
important
aspect
of
federal
labor
policy
and
so
on
but
then
they
stopped
right
in
the
middle
of
the
part
there
because
your
honors
went
on
to
say,
“however,
wherever
the
conduct
which
is
being
restrained
or
which
is
involved
is
an
opposition
to
that
involved
in
section
4
of
the
norris
laguardia
act.
it
just
can't
be
entertained.”
and
your
honor
said
that
the
courts
have
not
about
to
go
back
into
the
business
of
injunctions
again,
of
handing
out
injunctions
against
labor
unions.
and
so
that
--
i
think
that's
where
the
court
below
went
wrong
in
construing
or
in
referring
to
your
honors'
opinion.
i
stopped
right
in
the
middle
of
the
paragraph
and
they'd
left
out
the
vital
part.
if
i
--
if
i
may
even
--
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
after
reviewing
the
language
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
had
engaged
in,
and
they
stopped
--
as
i
said
right
in
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
your
honors,
the
paragraph
contiues
with
this
language.
at
the
most,
what
is
involved
is
the
question
of
whether
the
employer
is
to
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
injunction
along
with
a
right
which
congress
gave
him
in
section
301,
the
suit
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
as
we
have
already
pointed
out,
congress
was
not
willing
to
ensure
that
enjoyment
to
an
employer
at
the
cost
of
putting
the
federal
courts
back
into
the
business
and
of
enjoining
strikes
and
other
related
peaceful
union
activities.
this
is
the
part
that
the
court
below
didn't
see
apparently
and
overlooked.
and
this
changes
the
whole
complexion
of
the
opinion,
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
now,
your
honors,
in
that
case
also
reviewed
the
legislative
history
and
demonstrated
that
it
was
intended,
congress
specifically
intended
to
retain
the
provision
in
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
whether
or
not
the
federal
--
the
arbitration
provision
is
the
kingpin
of
federal
labor
policy,
this
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
not
for
this
court.
now,
the
same,
the
amici
who
filed
the
brief
here
were
also
involved
in
a
similar
situation.
they
argued
the
case
as
one
of
their
clients
was
involved
and
also
another
one
in
new
york
--
both
in
new
orleans
and
then
new
york.
in
the
new
york
case,
that
was
the
marine
transport
lines
versus
curran
the
specific
issue
involved
here
was
presented
there
in
which
the
amici
were
involved.
and
there,
they
made
the
distinction.
they
attempted
to
make
this
distinction
that
because
there
was
an
arbitrator's
award
involved,
somehow
that
gives
it
a
different
complexion
at
the
court
that's
not
really
a
labor
dispute
which
is
involved,
in
the
first
place,
that's
what
they
contended
and
the
second
place,
since
it
is
an
arbitrator's
award,
they're
not
really
were
stopping
a
work
stoppage.
that's
simply
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award.
here's
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
which
i've
set
forth
on
page
14
of
my
opinion
--
of
my
brief.
the
court
is
being
asked
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage.
this
is
the
reality
of
the
situation.
whatever
may
be
the
form
of
the
proceeding
and
citing
to
the
extent
that
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
that's
the
case
involved
here,
is
to
the
contrary,
i
decline
to
follow
that
position.
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
”in
sinclair,
the
employers
sought
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
before
the
arbitration
took
place
in
order
to
make
the
arbitration
effective”.
here,
the
employer
seeks
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
after
the
arbitration
has
taken
place
and
after
the
arbitrator
has
directed
that
the
work
stoppage
ceased.
in
my
opinion,
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
two
situations
as
far
as
the
power
of
this
court
is
concerned.
it
inevitably
follows
that
sinclair,
from
sinclair,
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
labor
request
here,
citing
also
the
gulf
south
america
case.
there
was
one
other
case
--
there's
one
case
which
the
respondent
here
relies
or
that's
the
new
orleans
case
in
which
the
decision
by
judge,
chief
judge
christenberry
down
there,
he
did
enforce
an
arbitration
award
back
in
1962.
however,
judge
christenberry
had
the
identical
question
before
him
in
gulf
south
america
case
and
this
was
after
the
sinclair
decision.
at
that
point,
after
reviewing
the
sinclair
decision,
he
reversed
himself
so
that
actually,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
--
there's
no
real
authority
or
they
don't
even
have
a
single
case
to
point
to
in
a
federal
system
which
could
support
their
proposition.
the
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
same
distinctions
were
made.
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
distinctions
were
made
there
and
which
are
made
here.
on
this
point,
the
court
there
found
that
there
were
two
aspects
to
it.
first
of
all,
they
found
that
the
arbitrator
himself
had
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
and
said
that
he
--
it
should
be
dismissed
on
that
ground.
but
they
also
made
this
point
right
squarely
on
this
--
the
point
that's
now
under
consideration
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion.
“the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
was
without
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
injunctive
relief
in
view
of
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
act.”
the
court
rejected
the
contention
of
the
employer
that
section
301
or
the
10(5)
of
the
act
was
a
pro
tanto
repealer
of
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
and
the
court
does
that
jurisdiction.
then
they
went
on
to
make
this
comment.
the
court
relied
on
sinclair
refining
company
versus
atkinson
as
authority
for
this
holding.
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
has
direct
authority
on
the
question
and
is
controlling.
there
the
employers
sought
the
injunction
directly
while
he
had
the
injunction
as
sort
under
the
guise
of
enforcing
the
award
of
an
arbitrator
but
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
any
other
result
would
be
exhorting
form
of
a
substance.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
connection
with
the
identical
contention
which
is
here
made
and
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
third
circuit.
now,
as
i
said,
there
are
only
two
cases
which
the
respondent
relies
on.
one
is
the
new
orleans
case.
i
think
the
amici
cited
by
chief
judge
christenberry
and
as
i
pointed
out,
chief
judge
christenberry
reversed
himself
in
the
later
gulf
south
america
case
and
he
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
case
is
the
rupert
case
cited
in
their
brief.
the
rupert
case
is
decided
on
the
basis
of
an
entirely
different
law.
it's
the
new
york
--
it
was
the
state
court
case
decided
by
the
state
court
of
new
york,
decided
on
the
state
law
of
new
york,
which
as
the
state
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
is
very
careful
to
point
out
is
different
in
the
federal
law
and
because
of
that
difference,
they
held
that
the
arbitrator's
award
could
be
enforced.
but
because
of
the
difference
in
the
new
york
statute
and
they
recognized
that
under
the
federal
system,
it
would
have
been
a
contrary
result
that
would
have
been
achieved
and
they
reviewed
some
of
the
federal
cases
on
the
subject.
there
are
a
number
like
the
seafarers
versus
bull
line
and
few
of
the
other
cases
and
they
said
that
well,
these
were
under
the
federal
statute
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
cannot
be
enjoined
your
honor
but
they
can
be
sued
for
damages.
if
the
union
is
wrong
and
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
sinclair,
the
damage
remedy
is
adequate.
the
damage
remedy
is
all
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
employers
under
the
circumstances
so
that
the
employers
are
not
without
a
remedy.
and
then
from
the
practical
standpoint,
the
skills
are
even
on
that
basis.
with
the
injunction,
and
i
think
that
perhaps
congress
was
motivated
by
this,
but
with
the
injunction,
the
employers
put
the
unions
in
a
straightjacket.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
court
orders
the
union
to
arbitrate
and
of
course,
that's
a
valid
order
that
--
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
norris-laguardia
(voice
overlap).
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
that's
an
injunction
but
it
is
not
an
injunction
restraining
any
of
the
protected
activity
under
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sinclair,
it
doesn't
restrain
a
strike.
if
you
make
the
union
go
to
arbitration,
it
doesn't
restrain
a
strike.
it
doesn't
restrain
any
of
the
other
things.
i
have
set
out
on
page
21
of
my
brief,
the
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
it
does
not
infringe
on
any
of
those
provisions
which
are
contained
in
section
4
not
the
order
compelling
arbitration.
section
4
was
designed
by
congress
to
prevent
injunctions
against
peaceful
strikes
and
against
--
i
might
say
also,
giving
publicity
to
the
existence
of
the
facts
involved
in
any
labor
dispute
and
so
on
whether
by
advertising,
patrolling
and
so
on.
there
are
few
of
the
four
five
things
but
none
of
these
provisions
would
prohibit
requiring
the
union
to
go
to
arbitration
and
incidentally
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor,
because
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
restrain.
if
the
order
--
no,
if
the
order
is
to
be
construed
to
restrain
a
work
stoppage
or
a
strike,
and
there
was
no
strike
incident
that
makes
it
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
no
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
--
if
the
order
--
if
the
order
restrained
a
strike,
if
it
was
the
intent
of
the
order
to
restrain
a
strike
then
it
was
a
nullity.
it
had
to
be
a
nullity.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor.
if
the
order
itself
has
to
be
a
nullity,
if
it
means
that
a
strike
is
restrained
under
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
act,
the
order
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
can
sue
for
damage
--
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
you
mean
restraining
civil
contempt
because
he'd
order
the
strike
restrained?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
not
under
norris-laguardia.
he
is
the
--
the
federal
courts
absolutely
are
forbidden
to
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
can
be
sued
for
damages
but
they
can't
be
restrained
by
court
order.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
our
point
your
honor.
that's
the
whole
point
we're
making
here.
it's
a
nullity.
since
he
intended
that
this
order
should
restrain
a
strike
or
work
stoppage,
it
has
to
be
a
nullity?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
no.
no,
because
there
are
many
other
types
of
awards.
if
it
was
a
money
award
that
could
be
that
the
arbitrator
may
say
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
this
is
what
congress
--
this
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
not
if
that
restrains
a
strike
or
work
stoppage
or
any
of
these
other
things
involved
in
section
4
of
norris-laguardia.
and
i
based
that
statement
on
your
honor's
opinion
in
section
4
as
spelled
out
as
clearly
as
it
could
possibly
be
in
sinclair.
if
the
order
--
as
your
honors
said,
if
i
may
use
your
honor's
phraseology,
at
most
what
is
involved
is
a
question
of
whether
the
employer
is
to
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
injunction
along
with
the
right
which
congress
gave
in
the
section
301.
that's
very
--
to
sue
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
as
we've
already
pointed
out,
we're
not
willing
to
ensure
jeopardy.
he
can
have
both.
the
congress
--
this
court
said
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
he
should
have
the
right
to
restrain
the
strike,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
strike.
i
might
point
out
that
we
have
been
assuming
here
that
the
union
was
on
strike
on
all
these
occasions
and
not
one
of
the
four
instances
and
no
instance
was
the
union
on
strike,
that
the
union
called
a
strike.
in
each
case,
it
was
spontaneous
work
stoppage
caused
by
the
men
who
are
affected,
who
went
on
four
hours
instead
of
one
hour.
so
that
there
was
actually
no
--
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
any
strike
here.we
have
assumed
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
but
actually,
the
facts
show
up
so
with
the
contrary.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
what
did
the
judge
hold
what,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
take
for
example
when
a
contempt
order,
the
--
this
is
the
way
the
situation
arose.
the
men
were
knocked
off
so
to
speak.
they
were
told
that
they
can't
go
to
work
in
the
morning
and
then
they
will
go
on
to
be
paid
their
one
hour
guarantee
and
they
protested
and
they
came
to
one
of
the
agents,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
smith.
and
he
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
wild
cat
strike.
all
he
said
was
there
was
a
wild
cat
strike,
thought
that
the
union
is
responsible
because
of
the
mass
action
of
the
members.
now,
here's
another
point
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
a
wild
cat
strike
caused
by
the
order.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
says
that
--
his
order
says
that
the
union,
its
officers
and
members
are
in
contempt
because
of
the
mass
action.
this
is
the
word
he
used,
“mass
action
of
the
members”
even
though
the
union
itself
tried
to
stop
the
strike
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
was
his
order
of
contempt
not
his
first
order
but
his
order
of
contempt.
now,
we
say
that
so
far
as
the
mass
action
is
concerned,
he
had
no
right
to
do
that
because
the
union
itself
did
not
strike.
the
union
did
everything
that
it
could
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibited
the
order
in
the
first
place.
his
sole
order
was
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
that
--
we
say
that
if
your
honor
holds
that
norris-laguardia
act
prevented
them
for
entering
such
an
order,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
next
question.
but
when
he
made
the
finding
that
the
union
was
responsible
for
the
mass
action
of
the
membership,
he
invoked
another
principle.
and
that
was
that
if
the
union
used
all
good
faith
in
order
to
stop
the
strike
and
did
not
precipitate
it
and
did
not
course
it,
did
not
call
it
on
the
first
instance,
then
it
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
this
action
of
the
members.
your
honors
have
got
to
remember
that
the
union
represents
not
only
its
members.
it
represents
the
whole
unit
which
may
be
non-members
and
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
members
and
i
may
say
its
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
first.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
you
don't
have
to
reach
any
other
argument.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
i'm
wrong,
if
your
honors
should
reverse
sinclair
--
i
pray
to
god
you
don't
but
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
or
distinguish.
if
your
honors
should
distinguish
to
use
the
expression
of
the
fifth
circuit,
i
won't
use
that
expression
since
it
seems
to
be
offensive
under
the
guise
of.
but
if
your
honor
should
distinguish
it,
i
would
say
then
we
come
to
these
other
points.
for
example,
mass
action
then
how
can
it
be
imputable
to
the
union?
and
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
yes.
mass
action
is
part
of
the
question,
your
honor.
that's
in
the
second
case.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
the
second
one.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
had
broken
this
down
to
the
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
the
injunction
case
which
involved
where
i
have
said
it's
the
innocuous
order
and
the
second
one
is
the
contempt
case
which
he
held
the
union
in
contempt
because
they
did
engage
in
a
work
stoppage,
not
the
union
but
these
men
engaged
in
work
stoppage
and
he
held
the
union
liable
for
the
mass
action
of
the
membership.
so
he
said
membership.
some
of
them
were
membership.
i
may
say
that
the
gentlemen
from
the
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
the
president
took
the
stand.
he
said
he
talked
to
some
of
these
men
who
were
striking
or
who
were
walking
the
picket
line.
he
said
he
never
even
had
seen
him
before.
he's
been
in
the
waterfront
20
or
30
years.
never
seen
him
before,
so
that
obviously,
there
was
a
strong
--
there
was
a
substantial
percentage
of
men
who
were
not
under
union.
but
assuming
even
they
were
union
members,
all
of
them,
the
point
is
that
the
union
cannot
be
held
liable
for
the
mass
action
of
the
members
unless
it
participated
with
the
members
and
unless
by
some
either
overt
act
or
by
some
failure
to
act
which
under
circumstances
where
they
should
have
acted.
as
for
example
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
mr.
lewis
first
didn't
send
out
a
single
letter
and
he
didn't
take
any
step
to
try
to
call
off
the
work
stoppage
and
under
the
circumstances,
he
was
in
contempt.
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
it
would
be
different
and
the
--
that
was
in
the
united
mine
workers
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
would
be
different
if
mr.
lewis
had
sent
out
a
letter
stating
his
position
that
he
didn't
want
a
strike
or
it
taken
some
means.
in
this
case,
the
union
sent
out
two
pamphlets
in
which
they
most
strongly
point
out
to
the
men
that
they
were
wrong,
that
they
had
got
--
they
got
a
good
contract
and
they
should
adhere
to
it
and
that
they
would
take
them
out
into
arbitration;
that
the
union
itself
would
handle
it,
that
union
officials
should
handle
it
but
the
men
nevertheless
engaged
in
this
wild
cat.
the
court
below
held
it
to
be
a
wild
cat.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
umb
decision,
they
should
be
absolved
for
the
actions
of
the
membership.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
fined
us
a
$100,000
a
day
your
honor,
and
they
were
--
the
men
continued
in
their
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
hasn't
--
he
held
another
hearing,
he
held
that
another
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
between
$200,000
and
$300,000.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
between
$200,000
and
$300,000.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
have
not
raised
the
question
about
the
specific
amount
your
honor,
because
he
hasn't
consult
to
fix
the
specific
amount
except
that
he
is
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
civil
or
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
it's
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
is
it
in
the
question?
it's
in
the
second
brief.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
take
it
that
what
your
honor's
talking
about
is
the
mass
action
aspect
of
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
this
comes
up
in
the
request
for
jury
trial,
which
is
number
4
in
the
next
case.
and
there,
the
court
below
said
that
since
this
came
at
this
--
they
held
that
this
was
a
criminal
contempt
or
rather
a
civil
contempt
and
they
held
that
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
would
be
appropriate
only
in
the
event
it
was
a
criminal
contempt.
actually,
this
is
a
specific
issue
which
we
have
raised
as
i
said
starting
on
page
17
of
our
brief
and
number
78,
your
honor,
and
which
the
question
of
civil
contempt
as
against
criminal
contempt
is
specifically
and
squarely
put
on
the
table.
now,
in
that
case,
when
the
act
itself
was
originally
enacted
in
the
norris-laguardia
--
it
was
part
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
originally,
it
covered
both
civil
and
criminal
contempt
arising
under
that
act,
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
subsequently,
it
was
transferred
from
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
put
them
under
title
xviii
with
the
criminal
statutes.
however,
the
act
itself
says
that
it
applies
to
all
contempt
arising
out
of
labor
disputes;
all
contempt
arising
out
of
labor
disputes.
the
court
below
read
that
language
to
mean
criminal
contempt
because
the
act
was
now
--
had
now
been
placed
in
title
xviii
which
relates
to
criminal
statutes.
actually,
the
--
am
i
reaching
what
your
honor
had
in
mind?
i
certainly
wanted
to
answer.
i
thought
that
this
would
--
now
actually,
the
question
of
criminal
contempt
and
civil
contempt
is
argued.
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
a
civil
contempt
and
therefore,
the
jury
trial
aspect,
the
jury
trial
wasn't
warranted
here.
we
say
that
the
language
in
the
act
is
very
clear.
we've
spelled
that
out.
it
says
that
it
applies
to
all
the
contempts
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute,
and
therefore,
a
party
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
those
circumstances
and
this
is
where
we
argued
the
question
of
criminal
as
against
civil
contempt.
and
we
said
that
when
they
put
--
even
though
they
put
it
in
title
xviii,
they
didn't
change
the
phraseology.
it
arise
--
it
applied
to
criminal
as
well
as
civil
and
the
act
was
not
changed
in
that
respect
but
they
took
out
that
phraseology
which
related
only
to
norris-laguardia
act.
as
i
said,
they
broadened
it
but
did
not
relate
it,
but
did
not
confine
it
only
to
criminal
contempt.
they
held
the
language
that
it
applies
to
all
cases
arising
out
of
labor
dispute.
and
i
may
say
that
originally,
when
the
act
was
first
enacted,
the
house
bill,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
house
bill
would
have
it
only
on
a
criminal
contempt,
your
honor,
whereas
the
senate
proposal
had
both
the
criminal
and
civil
contempts
involved
in
the
act.
the
house
changed
this
position
to
conform
with
the
senate
so
that
it
apply
to
all
both
criminal
and
civil
and
for
that
reason
alone,
we
said
that
we
we're
entitled
a
jury
trial.
we
may
entirely
request
for
a
jury
trial
but
here
again
the
court
--
i
see
my
time
has
been
up
for
a
while
and
i
haven't
covered
my
all
of
the
point
that
i
had
intended
to
cover,
i
hope
the
court
will
forgive
me
for
extending
my
time.
i
appreciate
the
additional
time.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
next
one
are
related
and
grow
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts.
i
might
characterize
the
first
case
as
the
injunction
action
and
the
second
as
the
contempt
case.
and
since
they
both
involved
and
grow
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts,
i
think,
i
would
like
to
review
the
basic
facts
first,
so
that
when
i
get
to
the
second
case,
i
need
only
go
right
into
the
legal
aspects
of
it
without
again
reviewing
the
factual
picture.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that
would
be
entirely
satisfactory
with
me,
if
your
honors.(voice
overlap)
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
your
honors.
i
think
that
would
simplify
matters
a
great
deal.
the
basic
questions,
your
honor,
on
the
first
case
the
so-called
“injunction
case”
as
i
have
outlined
that
characterized
it,
is
does
a
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
union
from
a
work
stoppage
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
under
the
guise
of
an
order
for
a
specific
performance
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award.
this
is
the
basic.
this
is
one
of
the
basics
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
perhaps
i
didn't
want
to
go
that
far
on
my
characterization
and
i
would
not
impute
any
impropriety
or
anything
of
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
not
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
a
basic
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
except,
your
honor,
there
is
this
much
about
it.
and
the
reason
i
used
the
expression
was
this.
in
the
first
instance,
we
relied
on
your
honor's
decision
in
the
sinclair
case
which
we
thought
met
the
basic
issues
squarely.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honors,
an
integral
part
of
this
court
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
we
would
all
defend
your
honor's
right
to
dissent.
i
think
that
even
under
your
honor's
opinion,
and
i
think
that
reading
your
honor's
opinion
and
taking
the
majority
decision,
the
distinction
which
is
made
here
by
the
court
below
could
not
stand
up
even
under
your
honor's
dissent
in
the
sinclair
case.
that's
why
i
used
the
word,
“under
the
guise
of”
because
in
the
other
case
we
met
the
issues
squarely.
the
issue
--
this
court
met
the
issue
squarely.
can
you
enter
an
order
restraining
a
labor
dispute?
can
this
--
can
any
federal
court
enter
an
order
restraining
a
work
stoppage
or
publicity
or
any
of
the
other
things
which
are
protected
by
the
norris-laguardia
act.
this
was
meeting
the
issue
squarely.
in
this
case,
the
issue
was
raised
while
--
“does
it
make
any
difference?”
the
court
below
said,
“well,
we're
not
really
restraining
a
work
stoppage,
we're
not
really
doing
any
of
the
other
things
which
involved
the
protective
activity.
what
we're
doing
here
is
simply
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award."
and
we
say
and
i
think
that
we
can
demonstrate
your
honor
that
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
and
therefore,
this
is
why
we
used
the
word
“under
the
guise
of”
and
i
think
that
even
under,
as
i
said
before,
under
your
honor's
dissenting
opinion,
that
distinction
could
not
be
tenable.
that
is
the
first,
that
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
if
your
honors
should
resolve
that
issue
as
your
honors
did
in
the
sinclair
in
favor
of
the
union
here,
then
everything
else
would
fall
away
because
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
below
to
entertain
any
of
the
other
problems.
again,
in
the
--
another
question,
the
second
question
may
be
broken
down
but
i'll
try
to
put
it
all
in
one
question,
involved
in
the
so-called
injunction
aspect
of
the
cases,
was
it
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
retain
jurisdiction,
assuming
that
he
had
it
in
the
first
place
of
a
case
admittedly
moot
just
in
case
something
might
happen
at
some
future
time,
and
thereafter,
when
another
dispute
unrelated
to
the
first
one
arose,
they
held
the
hearing
on
an
ex
parte
report
of
one
of
the
parties,
an
ex
parte
report
of
one
of
the
parties
without
any
formal
pleading,
without
setting
forth
on
record
any
new
complaint
or
any
amended
complaint
under
dispute.
and
without
requiring
any
newer
amended
complaint,
pleading
the
new
dispute
and
then
enter
an
innocuous
order
which
he
refused
to
explain
or
clarify
in
anyway
in
violation
of
rules
52
and
65(d)
--
rules
52(a)
and
65(d).
these
are
the
two
basic
questions
which
are
related
to
the
first
injunction
aspect
of
the
case,
your
honors.
now,
with
respect
to
the
basic
facts,
ila,
the
international
longshoremen's
association
is
in
contractual
relationship
with
pmta,
the
philadelphia
marine
trade
association
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
the
philadelphia
waterfront.
there
are
just
a
few
aspects
of
that
agreement
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honor's
attention.
just
i
think
four
possibly
five
points
--
five
provisions.
i
might
say
at
the
outset
that
one
of
the
major
provisions
in
this
contract
was
what
they
call
“the
day
before
hiring”.
previously,
they
would
hire
the
same
day
in
the
morning
and
the
man
would
not
know
whether
they
had
any
work
until
they
appeared
at
the
shape
up
of
18
different
points
along
the
waterfront
and
when
they
were
hired
that
day,
then
they
knew
they
had
hired
them,
they
would
have
certain
guarantees
so
that
they
couldn't
be
knocked
off
for
any
reason
except
those
specifically
outlined
in
the
agreement.
under
this
agreement
now,
they
had
to
be
told
the
day
before.
they
have
to
be
hired
that
day
before
for
work
commencing
the
next
day
and
it
might
be
during
the
period
of
the
--
during
the
top
period
that
the
ship
is
in.
in
any
event,
this
is
what
they
call
the
day
before
hiring.
this
hiring
is
not
done
at
the
hiring
center.
this
might
be
an
important
factor
your
honors
will
determine
later.
it
is
not
done
at
the
hiring
center.
these
men
are
advised
by
their
particular
foreman
the
day
before
and
they
appeared.
now,
one
of
the
key
provisions
involved
in
this
argument
is
the
provision
entitled
10(6).
this
is
the
section
10(6)
that
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
of
number
34
on
page
7
which
provides
what
they
call
a
“set-back
clause”
and
it
simply
gives
the
employer
the
right
to
postpone
the
start
of
work
from
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
men
get
a
one
hour
guarantee
for
the
morning's
work
which
they
missed.
another
provision
under
this
contract
is
section
9(h)
which
provides
that
when
the
men
are
not
put
to
work
because
of
inclement
weather,
then
they
must
be
given
the
four-hour
guarantee
for
the
morning.
the
difference
here
is
whether
or
not
the
one
hour
guarantee,
the
employers
here,
tend
to
assert
the
--
and
did
assert
the
section
10(6)
and
try
to
give
them
under
one
hour
guarantee
instead
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause
even
though
the
men
were
knocked
off
or
not
put
to
work
because
of
inclement
weather.
and
then
the
last
provision
that
i
would
note
to
your
honors'
attention
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
number
28
which
relates
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
and
this
provides
that
all
disputes
and
this
say,
i'm
quoting
the
language
now,
all
disputes
of
whatever
nature
or
kind
must
be
submitted
to
arbitration,
including
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
and
so
on.
it's
a
very
broad
clause
and
all
disputes.
and
i
may
say
that
under
this
clause,
and
under
this
particular
clause
and
under
the
practice
of
the
industry,
whenever
a
dispute
arose
and
that
was
sent
to
arbitration,
if
another
dispute
arose
involving
even
the
same
issue,
the
parties
did
have
the
right
and
in
fact
exercise
it
and
went
to
the
arbitrator
again.
there
may
be
some,
might
be
some
distinction
between
the
first
dispute
and
the
second
dispute.
but
in
any
event,
both
parties
always
exercise
the
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
as
many
times
as
they
wanted
and
i
may
say
that
previously,
and
i
cited
in
my
brief,
when
the
father
comey
was
the
arbitrator
on
the
philadelphia
waterfront,
he
--
the
same
issue,
i
think
it
was
under
14(d),
which
is
so-called
--
involving
the
introduction
of
the
so-called
“technological
advances”
into
the
waterfront.
father
comey
had
ruled
on
these
four
occasions
that
the
issue
was
not
arbitrable
and
on
each
occassion,
he
interpreted
this
section
14(d)
to
mean
that
this
was
a
matter
for
negotiation
of
the
parties
and
it
was
not
arbitrable
because
it
was
under
the
provisions
of
this
agreement.
it
involved
a
technological
advancement
and
therefore,
it
had
to
be
negotiated
and
not
arbitrated.
the
fifth
time,
the
same
kind
of
a
dispute
under
the
same
provision
of
the
agreement
came
before
father
comey.
he
again
refuted
and
said,
“well,
it's
only
human
to
err”
and
he
reversed
himself.
there
was
some
question.
my
friend
raises
the
question
and
says
that
he
didn't
really
reverse
himself.
i
think
he
did
the
arbitration
whether
there's
evidence
but
that
doesn't
matter.
the
point
is
that
he
received
the
same
dispute
and
the
same
clause
and
he
interpreted
the
same
clause
five
times.
the
first
four
times
uniformly;
the
fifth
time
he
reversed
himself.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
throughout,
even
though
the
same
issue
was
involved,
the
parties
had
the
right
to
go
to
arbitration
and
that
the
arbitrator
say
whether
(a)
if
it
is
the
same
dispute;
(b)
whether
he
still
wants
to
follow
the
same
decision
that
has
been
rendered
before
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
clause.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
is
in
the
port
of
philadelphia.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they're
covering
the
entire
fort
of
philadelphia.
this
is
a
provision,
a
contract
peculiar
to
the
port
of
philadelphia
which
embraces
both
sides
of
the
river
and
extend
down
the
river
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
one
agreement
covering
the
long
tract
of
the
entire
waterfront.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
it
just
couldn't
work
out
that
way.
first
of
all,
each
dispute
stands
on
its
own
two
feet.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sorry.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
court
order
is
one
of
the
things
that's
involved
in
this
case
your
honor
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
let
me
perhaps
break
it
down
now.
i
was
going
to
cover
this
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
point
to
break
it
up.
in
other
words,
we
had
one
dispute
where
the
employer
knocked
the
men
off
or
told
them
to
change
the
starting
time
from
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
he
is
supposed
to
do
that
by
7:30
in
the
morning.
so
the
contract
reads.
this
went
to
arbitration.
the
union
claims
that
it
was
governed
by
the
provisions
of
9(h),
which
relate
--
which
was
the
inclement
weather
clause.
the
men
were
changed
from
8:00
to
1:00
because
the
weather
was
inclement.
the
union
claimed
that
the
inclement
weather
clause
applied.
the
employer's
claim
that
section
10(6)
applied
which
they
said
was
unqualified.
so
they
went
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
handed
down
as
award
holding
that
section
10(6)
standing
by
itself
was
very
clear
and
it
must
not
be
construed
against
--
in
the
light
of
anything
else
in
the
agreement.
he
did
not
consider
9(h),
the
inclement
weather
clause
did
not
give
the
union
a
full
opportunity.
i
may
say
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
and
that
was
a
long
joint
out
hearing
too.
we
were
quite
surprise.
i
think
both
my
friend
and
myself
was
surprised
when
he
said
he
didn't
want
to
hear
argument,
he
didn't
want
have
briefs
so
that
we
could
sum
up
from
the
evidence
which
had
been
made.
in
any
event,
he
ruled
that
section
10(6)
of
the
agreement
was
an
unqualified
provision
which
said
that
the
employers
could
not
demand
the
offer,
could
postpone
the
employment
time
with
only
one
hour
guarantee
for
the
morning
instead
of
the
four-hour
inclement
weather
guarantee.
now,
the
next
time
a
dispute
arose
and
i
was
going
to
cover
this
specifically,
that
was
the
first
dispute
and
he
handed
that
down
in
connection
with
the
dispute
which
arose
on
april
in
1965.
about
two
or
three
months
later,
another
dispute
arose
and
men
knocked
off
in
this
--
and
each
one
of
these
instances,
they
were
knocked
off
because
the
men
--
one
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
they
thought
they
were
entitledto
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause
and
the
union
again
wanted
to
go
to
arbitration.
i
think
this
brings
up
your
focuses,
attention
immediately
on
the
point
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
and
that
is,
could
we
again
go
to
arbitration?
now,
just
as
the
employers
--
one
that
had
do
it
and
did
in
fact
do
it
in
other
--
in
connection
with
14(d)
when
new
advances
were
brought
in
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
new
piece
of
machinery
and
whether
the
clause
should
be
construed
for
arbitration
or
negotiation.
the
point
is
that
the
arbitrator
took
it
and
upon
his
--
followed
that
procedure.
now,
between
the
time
of
the
first
dispute,
your
honor,
and
the
time
of
the
last
one
which
was
about
10
months,
the
employers
invoked
this
clause
71
times;
71
times.
there
were
four
occasions,
however,
when
there
were
work
stoppages.
the
first
time,
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
work
stoppage
but
the
remaining
three
did
result
in
work
stoppages.
now,
when
your
honor
says
that
well,
they
could
do
it
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
day,
your
honor,
i
think
overlooks
the
fact
that
each
of
these
disputes
is
based
on
a
separate
set
of
facts.
it
may
involve
the
same
principle
or
it
may
not.
it
may
involve
a
qualification
of
that
principle.
but
whether
or
not
it
involves
the
same
principle,
there's
something
which
both
parties
have
a
right
to
test
just
as
this
court
has
even
in
the
past
reversed
itself
perhaps
not
frequently
but
it
has,
but
at
least,
the
parties
do
have
the
right
even
if
a
sort
--
that
this
court
should
hand
down
a
decision
on
a
particular
case.
well,
let's
take
mahnich
versus
southern
transportation
company
where
the
court
handed
down
--
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
and
handed
down
and
set
forth
the
principle
of
law.
later
on,
a
plaintiff
went
to
court
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
i
would
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
even
if
it
was
the
identical
issue,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
man
should
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
say,
i
think
you
were
wrong
before.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
precipitated
this
whole
conflict.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
was
a
big
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
only
a
part
of
it,
your
honor.
perhaps
they
answer
that
this
way.
ila
in
each
case,
when
a
dispute
arose
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
contempt
order
was
based
on
the
--
of
course
your
honor
is
correct
there.
the
contempt
order
is
based
on
the
work
stoppage
itself.
but
inherent
to
the
whole
question
is
the
fact
that
in
each
instance,
when
the
dispute
arose
after
the
first
dispute,
after
the
arbitration
was
decided,
and
the
arbitrator
have
gone
to
this
award
and
the
second
dispute
arose,
ila
at
that
time
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
arbitrator
again
to
have
an
arbitrator,
and
have
at
least
the
dispute
arbitrated.
the
arbitrator
could
have
said,
“i
agree
with
the
same
thing”.
i
adhere
to
my
ruling
the
same
as
father
comey
had
said
four
times
and
the
fifth
time
reversed
himself
or
he
could
have
said
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
a
difference.
now,
instead
of
the
employers
here
blocked
the
union
from
going
to
arbitration
by
bringing
this
lawsuit
before
judge
body
and
judge
body
at
that
time
took
jurisdiction
and
wouldn't
let
go.
and
very
effectively,
he
blocked
the
union
from
going
to
arbitration
throughout.
now,
well,
that
may
not
be
an
issue
in
this
case
directly.
it
is
related
as
part
of
the
overall
picture.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no.
on
the
contrary
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
might
do
it,
your
honor,
but
i
can't
go
that
far.
i
say
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
no
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
basic
facts,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
before,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
work
stoppage,
whether
or
not
the
court's
order
restrained
the
work
stoppage.
what
we
are
talking
about
now
is
a
related
problem
which
precipitated
the
conflict.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
this
is
a
pure
sinclair
case.
there's
no
question
about
it
to
my
mind.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
didn't
quite
get
your
point
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
we
can't
get
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
think
you're
right.
i
think
that
we
can
without
going
into
the
fact,
very
well,
sir.
let
me
get
right
into
it.
the
court
entered
--
entered
this
as
i
have
characterized
it,
a
very
innocuous
order
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
without
any
preliminary
pleadings,
without
any
of
the
other
safeguards
which
are
required
by
rules
3
and
4
and
rule
8
of
the
civil
rules
--
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
on
the
third
dispute,
judge
body
entered
an
order
in
which
he
said,
“the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.”
this
is
the
whole
order.
now,
what
was
the
order?
the
order,
in
effect
was
that
the
one-hour
guarantee
shall
be
given
instead
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
the
inclement
weather
clause.
there
was
no
order
by
the
arbitrator
requiring
the
men
to
return
to
work
and
when
he
simply
said
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced,
we
could
argue
that
on
some
other
case.
but
the
point
is
what
did
it
mean?
did
it
mean
that
there
was
a
work
stoppage
being
restrained?
did
it
mean
that
he
union
could
not
go
to
arbitration
again?
and
i
may
say
that
on
page
7
of
my
brief
--
7
and
then
the
footnotes
on
page
8
too
--
a
footnote
on
7
and
on
8,
your
honors
will
find
an
incredible
exchange
least
i
thought
it
was
incredible,
between
the
court
and
myself.
he
says,“you
can
read
the
english
language,
can't
you?”
all
that
it
said
was
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.
this
was
later
construed
to
be
an
injunction
or
a
restraining
order
and
yet,
it
just
simply
used
those
three
words.
no
fact
findings
as
required
by
rule
52(a)
and
all
non-jury
cases
have
certainly
no
fact
finding
or
anything
which
was
required
under
rule
64(d),
65(d),
which
relates
to
restraining
orders
or
injunctions.
so
i
asked
them
to
please
explain
it
and
here's
what
he
said
to
the
court,
“i
will
sign
this
order.”
that
was
the
order.
the
arbitrator's
award
will
be
enforced.
that's
the
works.
by
mr.
freedman,
“well,
what
does
it
mean,
your
honor?”
the
court,
“that
you
will
have
to
determine
what
it
means."
and
before
i
go
further,
the
rule
is
specific
with
respect
to
injunctions
if
it's
going
to
be
a
restraining
order.
the
parties
got
a
right
to
know.
the
rule
specifically
says,
you
got
to
tell
him
specifically
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
can't
do.
and
here's
what
the
further
colloquy
shows.
the
court,
“that
you
will
have
to
determine
what
it
means.”
mr.
freedman,
“well,
i'm
asking.
i
have
to
give
my
client
advice
and
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
i'm
asking
your
honor
to
tell
me
what
it
means.
it
doesn't”
--
the
court,
“you
handle
the
case.you
know
about
it.
you
are
arguing
it.
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
case.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“i'm
telling
you
very
frankly
now.
i
don't
know
what
this
order
means,
this
proposed
order.
it
says
'enforcement
of
the
award'.
now,
just
what
doesn't
mean.
are
we
being
restrained
from
the
work
stoppage?”
the
court,
“the
court
has
acted.
this
is
the
order.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“well,
won't
your
honor
tell
me
what
it
means?”
the
court,
“you
read
the
english
language
and
i
do.”
by
mr.
freedman,
“i
will
ask
you
but
it
doesn't
say
it.
i
can't
understand
it.
i'm
telling
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
it.
now,
perhaps,
your
honor
can
explain
it
to
me
that
this
means
that
the
union
cannot
engage
in
a
strike
or
refuse
to
work
or
picket?”
the
court,
“you
know
what
the
arbitration
was
about.
you
know
the
result
of
the
arbitration.”
mr.
freedman,
“your
arbitration
here
was
under
a
specific
set
of
facts
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
under
a
specific
set
of
facts
and
he
made
that
interpretation.
now,
how
do
you
enforce
it?
the
case
is
over
and
done
with.
that
case
is
over
and
done
with.
these
are
new
cases.
your
honor
is
changing
the
contract
to
the
parties
when
you
foreclosed
them
from
going
to
arbitration
on
this
point
again.”
the
court,
“i
have
signed
the
order.
anything
else
to
came
before
us.”
mr.
freedman,
“i
know,
but
your
honor
is
leaving
me
in
the
sky.
i
don't
know
what
to
say
to
my
client.”
now,
that
was
precisely
the
situation.
that
in
the
face
of
rule
65(d)
which
says
that
when
you
got
a
restraining
order,
if
it
was
in
fact
a
restraining
order,
it's
got
to
spell
out
specifically
the
conduct
which
you
can
do,
which
you
cannot
do
so
that
the
defendant
doesn't
get
trapped
in
any
kind
of
situation.
and
here,
the
court
just
threw
away
the
rule
book.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir,
if
it
was
a
restraining
order
or
if
it
was
an
injunction.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
subsequently
construed
it
as
a
restraining
order
or
an
order
restraining
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
arbitrator's
award
said,
“i
hold
that
rule
10(6),
section
10(6)
is
not
qualified
and
i
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
he
didn't
even
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
qualified
but
he
said
qualified
by
standing
by
itself.
he
refused
to
construe
it
in
the
light
of
any
other
provision
agreement.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
what
he
held,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
that's
correct,
absolutely
right.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
said,
in
that
case
under
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
union
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
absolutely
not.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
contract.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
the
arbitrator
here
simply
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
gave
a
set
of
facts
which
clearly
spelled
out
a
violation
of
the
contract
by
the
union
and
i
would
clearly
admit
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
asked
me
if
the
union
would
be
in
violation
of
the
contract,
if
there
was
a
--
if
the
arbitrator
covered
as
did
--
as
he
did
here.
he
was
construing
the
contract,
no
question
about
it.
but
he
was
construing
it
under
specific
set
of
facts
in
a
particular
dispute.
i
may
say
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
i
was
concerned
that
what
your
honor
was
talking
about
now
might
have
been
in
the
judge's
mind.
i
was
concerned
about
that
very
point
that's
why
i
asked
him.
does
the
order
restrain
a
work
stoppage?
i
wasn't
sure
by
any
means.
i
was
also
concerned,
your
honor,
that
we
could
not
go
to
arbitration
again
on
any
manner
which
might
even
remotely
resolve
the
situation
even
though
i
thought
we
had
a
right
to
do
it
and
so
i
asked
him
those
questions.
now,
i
have
a
right
to
know
when
rule
65(d)
spells
that
out
very
specifically
that
he's
got
to
set
it
forth
--
he's
going
to
set
forth
what
we
can
do
and
what
we
can't
do.
now,
the
best
that
you
can
give
to
this
is
that
you
have
to
guess
what
it
means.
you
have
to
guess
it
what
he
means.
now,
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
under
these
circumstances
in
this
case,
just
giving
expression
to
rule
10(6)
of
the
agreement,
the
employers
can't
change
it
but
how
about
9(h)?
he
didn't
--
the
arbitrator
didn't
say
a
word
about
9(h)
and
the
union
came
in
here
and
one
of
the
four-hour
guarantee
under
9(h)
but
he
didn't
say
anything
on
9(h).
now
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
very
well,
sir.
i
think
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
though
on
that
point
to
leave
it
that
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
clearly
in
error
in
failing
to
spell
out
what
he
had
in
mind
especially
if
there
was
any
confusion
in
my
mind
i
had
a
right
to
know.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
and
52(a)
also
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
it
is
self-executing
but
i
think
that
we
can
also
show
prejudice,
how
much
prejudice
that
he's
practically
putting
the
union
out
of
business
with
the
order
which
he
subsequent
--
which
he
himself
subsequently
construed
to
be
a
restraining
order.
i
might
say
your
honor,
just
before
i
leave
that
subject
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
i
argued
this
case,
one
of
the
judges
said,
he
doesn't
mean
a
restraining
order.
what
he
said
is
just
enforcing
the
award.
that's
not
a
restraining
order.
it
doesn't
say
he's
restraining
any
work
stoppage.
this
is
what
was
said
to
me
and
i
said
i
can't
tell.
at
least
i
was
entitled
to
as
a
clear
explanation
from
the
court
as
to
what
he
meant.
and
if
he
meant
to
restrain
it,
i
think
he
had
a
duty
to
say
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
what
he
should
have
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
didn't
say
and
wouldn't
say
whether
or
not
it
restrained
any
work
stoppage,
whether
it
restrained
picketing,
whether
or
not
it
restrained
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
arbitrator's
award
--
your
honor,
the
arbitrator's
award
could
mean
a
lot
of
things.
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
any
doubt
about
it
at
all.
and
i,
as
counsel,
had
great
doubt
in
my
mind
about
what
it
meant.
i
know
that
he
probably
have
in
his
mind
a
restraining
order
against
the
strike
or
whatever
it
was
but
i
think
you
should
have
said
and
i
wasn't
sure.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
i
had
a
great
doubt
in
my
mind
whether
he
meant
by
that
that
if
you
don't
abide
that
this
award
means
that
you
can
strike
in
connection
with
that,
that
the
men
can't
picket,
the
man
can't
engage
in
any
work
stoppage.
also,
i
was
concerned
that
this
particular
expression
which
he
used
restrained
us
from
going
to
arbitration
again
on
the
same
point
by
the
same
principle
in
any
other
dispute.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
preventative
for
what,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
arbitrator
were
to
hold
that
a
work
stoppage
under
these
circumstances
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract,
i
would
say
that
the
--
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
admit
that
the
union
would
be
violating
the
agreement
if
it
did
so.
if
the
arbitrator
would
say
so,
we
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
ask
him
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
your
honor
that
your
honor's
posing
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
change
in
parties
may
have
something
to
do
with
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
order
itself,
your
honor,
did
not
restrain
a
work
stoppage.
the
order
itself
did
not.
so
when
you
enforce
a
work
stoppage
or
that
the
order
did
was
to
say
that
the
manner
entitled
only
to
one
hour
instead
of
four
hours.
that's
the
effect
of
the
order.
now,
when
you
enforce
that
order,
it
means
that
in
that
dispute
on
april
25th,
the
men
couldn't
get
their
four
hours.
they
can
only
get
one
hour.
there
was
no
work
stoppage
involved.
now,
when
we
enforce
that
order,
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
that
we
have
to
extend
and
we
have
to
reason
and
argue
that
from
that,
in
the
future,
if
we
engage
in
that
again
there
would
be
--
the
arbitrator
would
hand
down
a
decision
saying
“you've
got
to
go
back
to
work”.
all
he
did
was
decide
that
the
men
were
only
entitled
to
one
hour
instead
of
four
hours.
that's
what
he
decided.
there
was
no
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
men
should
go
back
to
work.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
is
absolutely
governed.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
an
injunction,
as
subsequent
development
showed,
an
injunction
against
the
work
stoppage,
a
violation
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
arbitrator's
award
has
already
carried
out.
the
men
didn't
get
their
four
hours.
they
get
one
hour
and
nobody
went
on
to
dispute
about
that
so
that
so
far
as
that
award
was
concerned,
it
was
done
and
over
with.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
dispute
arose,
there
would
be
another
question
of
whether
it
should
be
four
hours
or
one
hour.
what
the
union
wanted
to
do
is
to
have
the
arbitrator
pass
and
determine
the
validity
of
section
9(h)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
the
union
struck
and
it
was
found
that
they
violated
the
agreement,
they
could
be
sued
for
damages.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
could
have
–-
but
your
honor's
relating
that
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
they
could
sue
us
for
damages
but
i
don't
think
that
they
could
prevail.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
because
the
arbitrator's
award
would
then
have
to
be
an
issue
then
we
would
make
that
--
we
would
not
have
to
accept
the
arbitrator's
judgment.
he
would
have
to
approve
whoever
came
in
the
court
under
those
circumstances,
would
have
to
prove
the
contract
and
then
they
would
have
to
cope
with
rule
98(h),
the
inclement
whether
clause.
it
had
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
right.
he
said
that
this
clause
has
to
be
construed
all
by
itself
without
regard
to
any
other
part
of
the
agreement.
that's
what
the
arbitrator
said.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
may
be
i'd
better
get
right
to
the
sinclair
case.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
know
your
honors
have
been
waiting
for
this
one
too
and
i
certainly
do
want
to
get
to
it.
the
sinclair
case
is
very
similar
except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
sinclair,
there
was
no
arbitration
award
as
such
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there
was
an
award
or
whether
there
was
no
award
if
you
have
in
fact
the
basic
provisions
to
the
agreement.
here
you
have
a
--
in
sinclair
as
here,
you
had
an
arbitration
provision
which
was
final
and
binding,
you
had
a
no-strike
clause
which
was
the
same
as
the
no-strike
clause
that
well,
which
you
can
impute
to
this
contract
also.
there
was
no
real
distinction
between
sinclair
and
in
this
case.
in
sinclair,
your
honors
held
that
although
you
could
have
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award,
you
could
--
it
would
be
enforced
except
to
the
extent
that
it
would
run
afoul
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
in
all
other
aspects,
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
an
appeal,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir
and
sinclair
said
that.
you
can
have
an
order
requiring
the
parties
to
go
arbitration
and
that
did
not
run
into
or
run
afoul
of
the
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
sinclair
said
it
was
an
injunction.
sinclair,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
-–
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
norris-laguardia
act
prohibited.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
although
there
was
no
arbitrator's
award
in
sinclair,
necessarily
however,
that
fact
is
implicit
because
in
order
to
reach
this
decision
--
in
order
to
reach
your
honor's
decision,
you
went
in
to
the
whole
history
of
it,
the
history
which
showed
--
the
legislative
history
which
showed
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
been
superseded
by
the
enactment
of
section
301
of
the
labor
act.
and
your
honors
finally
held
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
all
the
vitality
that
it
had
before
the
enactment
of
section
301.
so
that
we
start
with
a
premise
that
you
can
have
the
enforcement
of
an
award
and
--
oh!
and
that
same
case,
your
honors
held
that
the
--
you
recognized
that
arbitration
was
the
so-called
“kingpin
of
the
federal
labor
policy”.
but
you
said
that
this
court
is
not
the
one
that
forged
it.
that
was
for
congress
to
forge
and
i
might
say
there
that
i
think
that
the
court
below
went
astray
when
they
took
a
part
of
your
honor's
decision
in
the
sinclair
cases,
stopped
right
in
the
middle
where
this
court
was
saying
that
arbitration
is
an
important
aspect
of
federal
labor
policy
and
so
on
but
then
they
stopped
right
in
the
middle
of
the
part
there
because
your
honors
went
on
to
say,
“however,
wherever
the
conduct
which
is
being
restrained
or
which
is
involved
is
an
opposition
to
that
involved
in
section
4
of
the
norris
laguardia
act.
it
just
can't
be
entertained.”
and
your
honor
said
that
the
courts
have
not
about
to
go
back
into
the
business
of
injunctions
again,
of
handing
out
injunctions
against
labor
unions.
and
so
that
--
i
think
that's
where
the
court
below
went
wrong
in
construing
or
in
referring
to
your
honors'
opinion.
i
stopped
right
in
the
middle
of
the
paragraph
and
they'd
left
out
the
vital
part.
if
i
--
if
i
may
even
--
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
after
reviewing
the
language
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
had
engaged
in,
and
they
stopped
--
as
i
said
right
in
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
your
honors,
the
paragraph
contiues
with
this
language.
at
the
most,
what
is
involved
is
the
question
of
whether
the
employer
is
to
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
injunction
along
with
a
right
which
congress
gave
him
in
section
301,
the
suit
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
as
we
have
already
pointed
out,
congress
was
not
willing
to
ensure
that
enjoyment
to
an
employer
at
the
cost
of
putting
the
federal
courts
back
into
the
business
and
of
enjoining
strikes
and
other
related
peaceful
union
activities.
this
is
the
part
that
the
court
below
didn't
see
apparently
and
overlooked.
and
this
changes
the
whole
complexion
of
the
opinion,
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
now,
your
honors,
in
that
case
also
reviewed
the
legislative
history
and
demonstrated
that
it
was
intended,
congress
specifically
intended
to
retain
the
provision
in
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
whether
or
not
the
federal
--
the
arbitration
provision
is
the
kingpin
of
federal
labor
policy,
this
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
not
for
this
court.
now,
the
same,
the
amici
who
filed
the
brief
here
were
also
involved
in
a
similar
situation.
they
argued
the
case
as
one
of
their
clients
was
involved
and
also
another
one
in
new
york
--
both
in
new
orleans
and
then
new
york.
in
the
new
york
case,
that
was
the
marine
transport
lines
versus
curran
the
specific
issue
involved
here
was
presented
there
in
which
the
amici
were
involved.
and
there,
they
made
the
distinction.
they
attempted
to
make
this
distinction
that
because
there
was
an
arbitrator's
award
involved,
somehow
that
gives
it
a
different
complexion
at
the
court
that's
not
really
a
labor
dispute
which
is
involved,
in
the
first
place,
that's
what
they
contended
and
the
second
place,
since
it
is
an
arbitrator's
award,
they're
not
really
were
stopping
a
work
stoppage.
that's
simply
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award.
here's
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
which
i've
set
forth
on
page
14
of
my
opinion
--
of
my
brief.
the
court
is
being
asked
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage.
this
is
the
reality
of
the
situation.
whatever
may
be
the
form
of
the
proceeding
and
citing
to
the
extent
that
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
that's
the
case
involved
here,
is
to
the
contrary,
i
decline
to
follow
that
position.
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
”in
sinclair,
the
employers
sought
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
before
the
arbitration
took
place
in
order
to
make
the
arbitration
effective”.
here,
the
employer
seeks
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
after
the
arbitration
has
taken
place
and
after
the
arbitrator
has
directed
that
the
work
stoppage
ceased.
in
my
opinion,
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
two
situations
as
far
as
the
power
of
this
court
is
concerned.
it
inevitably
follows
that
sinclair,
from
sinclair,
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
labor
request
here,
citing
also
the
gulf
south
america
case.
there
was
one
other
case
--
there's
one
case
which
the
respondent
here
relies
or
that's
the
new
orleans
case
in
which
the
decision
by
judge,
chief
judge
christenberry
down
there,
he
did
enforce
an
arbitration
award
back
in
1962.
however,
judge
christenberry
had
the
identical
question
before
him
in
gulf
south
america
case
and
this
was
after
the
sinclair
decision.
at
that
point,
after
reviewing
the
sinclair
decision,
he
reversed
himself
so
that
actually,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
--
there's
no
real
authority
or
they
don't
even
have
a
single
case
to
point
to
in
a
federal
system
which
could
support
their
proposition.
the
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
same
distinctions
were
made.
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
distinctions
were
made
there
and
which
are
made
here.
on
this
point,
the
court
there
found
that
there
were
two
aspects
to
it.
first
of
all,
they
found
that
the
arbitrator
himself
had
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
and
said
that
he
--
it
should
be
dismissed
on
that
ground.
but
they
also
made
this
point
right
squarely
on
this
--
the
point
that's
now
under
consideration
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion.
“the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
was
without
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
injunctive
relief
in
view
of
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
act.”
the
court
rejected
the
contention
of
the
employer
that
section
301
or
the
10(5)
of
the
act
was
a
pro
tanto
repealer
of
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
and
the
court
does
that
jurisdiction.
then
they
went
on
to
make
this
comment.
the
court
relied
on
sinclair
refining
company
versus
atkinson
as
authority
for
this
holding.
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
has
direct
authority
on
the
question
and
is
controlling.
there
the
employers
sought
the
injunction
directly
while
he
had
the
injunction
as
sort
under
the
guise
of
enforcing
the
award
of
an
arbitrator
but
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
any
other
result
would
be
exhorting
form
of
a
substance.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
connection
with
the
identical
contention
which
is
here
made
and
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
third
circuit.
now,
as
i
said,
there
are
only
two
cases
which
the
respondent
relies
on.
one
is
the
new
orleans
case.
i
think
the
amici
cited
by
chief
judge
christenberry
and
as
i
pointed
out,
chief
judge
christenberry
reversed
himself
in
the
later
gulf
south
america
case
and
he
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
case
is
the
rupert
case
cited
in
their
brief.
the
rupert
case
is
decided
on
the
basis
of
an
entirely
different
law.
it's
the
new
york
--
it
was
the
state
court
case
decided
by
the
state
court
of
new
york,
decided
on
the
state
law
of
new
york,
which
as
the
state
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
is
very
careful
to
point
out
is
different
in
the
federal
law
and
because
of
that
difference,
they
held
that
the
arbitrator's
award
could
be
enforced.
but
because
of
the
difference
in
the
new
york
statute
and
they
recognized
that
under
the
federal
system,
it
would
have
been
a
contrary
result
that
would
have
been
achieved
and
they
reviewed
some
of
the
federal
cases
on
the
subject.
there
are
a
number
like
the
seafarers
versus
bull
line
and
few
of
the
other
cases
and
they
said
that
well,
these
were
under
the
federal
statute
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
cannot
be
enjoined
your
honor
but
they
can
be
sued
for
damages.
if
the
union
is
wrong
and
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
sinclair,
the
damage
remedy
is
adequate.
the
damage
remedy
is
all
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
employers
under
the
circumstances
so
that
the
employers
are
not
without
a
remedy.
and
then
from
the
practical
standpoint,
the
skills
are
even
on
that
basis.
with
the
injunction,
and
i
think
that
perhaps
congress
was
motivated
by
this,
but
with
the
injunction,
the
employers
put
the
unions
in
a
straightjacket.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
court
orders
the
union
to
arbitrate
and
of
course,
that's
a
valid
order
that
--
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
norris-laguardia
(voice
overlap).
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
that's
an
injunction
but
it
is
not
an
injunction
restraining
any
of
the
protected
activity
under
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sinclair,
it
doesn't
restrain
a
strike.
if
you
make
the
union
go
to
arbitration,
it
doesn't
restrain
a
strike.
it
doesn't
restrain
any
of
the
other
things.
i
have
set
out
on
page
21
of
my
brief,
the
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
it
does
not
infringe
on
any
of
those
provisions
which
are
contained
in
section
4
not
the
order
compelling
arbitration.
section
4
was
designed
by
congress
to
prevent
injunctions
against
peaceful
strikes
and
against
--
i
might
say
also,
giving
publicity
to
the
existence
of
the
facts
involved
in
any
labor
dispute
and
so
on
whether
by
advertising,
patrolling
and
so
on.
there
are
few
of
the
four
five
things
but
none
of
these
provisions
would
prohibit
requiring
the
union
to
go
to
arbitration
and
incidentally
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor,
because
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
restrain.
if
the
order
--
no,
if
the
order
is
to
be
construed
to
restrain
a
work
stoppage
or
a
strike,
and
there
was
no
strike
incident
that
makes
it
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
no
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
--
if
the
order
--
if
the
order
restrained
a
strike,
if
it
was
the
intent
of
the
order
to
restrain
a
strike
then
it
was
a
nullity.
it
had
to
be
a
nullity.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor.
if
the
order
itself
has
to
be
a
nullity,
if
it
means
that
a
strike
is
restrained
under
section
4
of
norris-laguardia
act,
the
order
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
can
sue
for
damage
--
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
you
mean
restraining
civil
contempt
because
he'd
order
the
strike
restrained?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
not
under
norris-laguardia.
he
is
the
--
the
federal
courts
absolutely
are
forbidden
to
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
they
can
be
sued
for
damages
but
they
can't
be
restrained
by
court
order.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
our
point
your
honor.
that's
the
whole
point
we're
making
here.
it's
a
nullity.
since
he
intended
that
this
order
should
restrain
a
strike
or
work
stoppage,
it
has
to
be
a
nullity?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
no.
no,
because
there
are
many
other
types
of
awards.
if
it
was
a
money
award
that
could
be
that
the
arbitrator
may
say
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
this
is
what
congress
--
this
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
not
if
that
restrains
a
strike
or
work
stoppage
or
any
of
these
other
things
involved
in
section
4
of
norris-laguardia.
and
i
based
that
statement
on
your
honor's
opinion
in
section
4
as
spelled
out
as
clearly
as
it
could
possibly
be
in
sinclair.
if
the
order
--
as
your
honors
said,
if
i
may
use
your
honor's
phraseology,
at
most
what
is
involved
is
a
question
of
whether
the
employer
is
to
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
an
injunction
along
with
the
right
which
congress
gave
in
the
section
301.
that's
very
--
to
sue
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
as
we've
already
pointed
out,
we're
not
willing
to
ensure
jeopardy.
he
can
have
both.
the
congress
--
this
court
said
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
he
should
have
the
right
to
restrain
the
strike,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
strike.
i
might
point
out
that
we
have
been
assuming
here
that
the
union
was
on
strike
on
all
these
occasions
and
not
one
of
the
four
instances
and
no
instance
was
the
union
on
strike,
that
the
union
called
a
strike.
in
each
case,
it
was
spontaneous
work
stoppage
caused
by
the
men
who
are
affected,
who
went
on
four
hours
instead
of
one
hour.
so
that
there
was
actually
no
--
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
any
strike
here.we
have
assumed
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
but
actually,
the
facts
show
up
so
with
the
contrary.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
what
did
the
judge
hold
what,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
take
for
example
when
a
contempt
order,
the
--
this
is
the
way
the
situation
arose.
the
men
were
knocked
off
so
to
speak.
they
were
told
that
they
can't
go
to
work
in
the
morning
and
then
they
will
go
on
to
be
paid
their
one
hour
guarantee
and
they
protested
and
they
came
to
one
of
the
agents,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
smith.
and
he
said
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
wild
cat
strike.
all
he
said
was
there
was
a
wild
cat
strike,
thought
that
the
union
is
responsible
because
of
the
mass
action
of
the
members.
now,
here's
another
point
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
a
wild
cat
strike
caused
by
the
order.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
says
that
--
his
order
says
that
the
union,
its
officers
and
members
are
in
contempt
because
of
the
mass
action.
this
is
the
word
he
used,
“mass
action
of
the
members”
even
though
the
union
itself
tried
to
stop
the
strike
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
was
his
order
of
contempt
not
his
first
order
but
his
order
of
contempt.
now,
we
say
that
so
far
as
the
mass
action
is
concerned,
he
had
no
right
to
do
that
because
the
union
itself
did
not
strike.
the
union
did
everything
that
it
could
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibited
the
order
in
the
first
place.
his
sole
order
was
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
that
--
we
say
that
if
your
honor
holds
that
norris-laguardia
act
prevented
them
for
entering
such
an
order,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
next
question.
but
when
he
made
the
finding
that
the
union
was
responsible
for
the
mass
action
of
the
membership,
he
invoked
another
principle.
and
that
was
that
if
the
union
used
all
good
faith
in
order
to
stop
the
strike
and
did
not
precipitate
it
and
did
not
course
it,
did
not
call
it
on
the
first
instance,
then
it
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
this
action
of
the
members.
your
honors
have
got
to
remember
that
the
union
represents
not
only
its
members.
it
represents
the
whole
unit
which
may
be
non-members
and
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
members
and
i
may
say
its
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
first.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
you
don't
have
to
reach
any
other
argument.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
i'm
wrong,
if
your
honors
should
reverse
sinclair
--
i
pray
to
god
you
don't
but
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
or
distinguish.
if
your
honors
should
distinguish
to
use
the
expression
of
the
fifth
circuit,
i
won't
use
that
expression
since
it
seems
to
be
offensive
under
the
guise
of.
but
if
your
honor
should
distinguish
it,
i
would
say
then
we
come
to
these
other
points.
for
example,
mass
action
then
how
can
it
be
imputable
to
the
union?
and
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh!
yes.
mass
action
is
part
of
the
question,
your
honor.
that's
in
the
second
case.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
the
second
one.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
had
broken
this
down
to
the
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
the
injunction
case
which
involved
where
i
have
said
it's
the
innocuous
order
and
the
second
one
is
the
contempt
case
which
he
held
the
union
in
contempt
because
they
did
engage
in
a
work
stoppage,
not
the
union
but
these
men
engaged
in
work
stoppage
and
he
held
the
union
liable
for
the
mass
action
of
the
membership.
so
he
said
membership.
some
of
them
were
membership.
i
may
say
that
the
gentlemen
from
the
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
the
president
took
the
stand.
he
said
he
talked
to
some
of
these
men
who
were
striking
or
who
were
walking
the
picket
line.
he
said
he
never
even
had
seen
him
before.
he's
been
in
the
waterfront
20
or
30
years.
never
seen
him
before,
so
that
obviously,
there
was
a
strong
--
there
was
a
substantial
percentage
of
men
who
were
not
under
union.
but
assuming
even
they
were
union
members,
all
of
them,
the
point
is
that
the
union
cannot
be
held
liable
for
the
mass
action
of
the
members
unless
it
participated
with
the
members
and
unless
by
some
either
overt
act
or
by
some
failure
to
act
which
under
circumstances
where
they
should
have
acted.
as
for
example
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
mr.
lewis
first
didn't
send
out
a
single
letter
and
he
didn't
take
any
step
to
try
to
call
off
the
work
stoppage
and
under
the
circumstances,
he
was
in
contempt.
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
it
would
be
different
and
the
--
that
was
in
the
united
mine
workers
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
would
be
different
if
mr.
lewis
had
sent
out
a
letter
stating
his
position
that
he
didn't
want
a
strike
or
it
taken
some
means.
in
this
case,
the
union
sent
out
two
pamphlets
in
which
they
most
strongly
point
out
to
the
men
that
they
were
wrong,
that
they
had
got
--
they
got
a
good
contract
and
they
should
adhere
to
it
and
that
they
would
take
them
out
into
arbitration;
that
the
union
itself
would
handle
it,
that
union
officials
should
handle
it
but
the
men
nevertheless
engaged
in
this
wild
cat.
the
court
below
held
it
to
be
a
wild
cat.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
umb
decision,
they
should
be
absolved
for
the
actions
of
the
membership.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
he
fined
us
a
$100,000
a
day
your
honor,
and
they
were
--
the
men
continued
in
their
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
hasn't
--
he
held
another
hearing,
he
held
that
another
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
between
$200,000
and
$300,000.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
between
$200,000
and
$300,000.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
have
not
raised
the
question
about
the
specific
amount
your
honor,
because
he
hasn't
consult
to
fix
the
specific
amount
except
that
he
is
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
civil
or
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
it's
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
is
it
in
the
question?
it's
in
the
second
brief.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
take
it
that
what
your
honor's
talking
about
is
the
mass
action
aspect
of
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
this
comes
up
in
the
request
for
jury
trial,
which
is
number
4
in
the
next
case.
and
there,
the
court
below
said
that
since
this
came
at
this
--
they
held
that
this
was
a
criminal
contempt
or
rather
a
civil
contempt
and
they
held
that
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
would
be
appropriate
only
in
the
event
it
was
a
criminal
contempt.
actually,
this
is
a
specific
issue
which
we
have
raised
as
i
said
starting
on
page
17
of
our
brief
and
number
78,
your
honor,
and
which
the
question
of
civil
contempt
as
against
criminal
contempt
is
specifically
and
squarely
put
on
the
table.
now,
in
that
case,
when
the
act
itself
was
originally
enacted
in
the
norris-laguardia
--
it
was
part
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
originally,
it
covered
both
civil
and
criminal
contempt
arising
under
that
act,
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
subsequently,
it
was
transferred
from
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
put
them
under
title
xviii
with
the
criminal
statutes.
however,
the
act
itself
says
that
it
applies
to
all
contempt
arising
out
of
labor
disputes;
all
contempt
arising
out
of
labor
disputes.
the
court
below
read
that
language
to
mean
criminal
contempt
because
the
act
was
now
--
had
now
been
placed
in
title
xviii
which
relates
to
criminal
statutes.
actually,
the
--
am
i
reaching
what
your
honor
had
in
mind?
i
certainly
wanted
to
answer.
i
thought
that
this
would
--
now
actually,
the
question
of
criminal
contempt
and
civil
contempt
is
argued.
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
a
civil
contempt
and
therefore,
the
jury
trial
aspect,
the
jury
trial
wasn't
warranted
here.
we
say
that
the
language
in
the
act
is
very
clear.
we've
spelled
that
out.
it
says
that
it
applies
to
all
the
contempts
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute,
and
therefore,
a
party
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
those
circumstances
and
this
is
where
we
argued
the
question
of
criminal
as
against
civil
contempt.
and
we
said
that
when
they
put
--
even
though
they
put
it
in
title
xviii,
they
didn't
change
the
phraseology.
it
arise
--
it
applied
to
criminal
as
well
as
civil
and
the
act
was
not
changed
in
that
respect
but
they
took
out
that
phraseology
which
related
only
to
norris-laguardia
act.
as
i
said,
they
broadened
it
but
did
not
relate
it,
but
did
not
confine
it
only
to
criminal
contempt.
they
held
the
language
that
it
applies
to
all
cases
arising
out
of
labor
dispute.
and
i
may
say
that
originally,
when
the
act
was
first
enacted,
the
house
bill,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
house
bill
would
have
it
only
on
a
criminal
contempt,
your
honor,
whereas
the
senate
proposal
had
both
the
criminal
and
civil
contempts
involved
in
the
act.
the
house
changed
this
position
to
conform
with
the
senate
so
that
it
apply
to
all
both
criminal
and
civil
and
for
that
reason
alone,
we
said
that
we
we're
entitled
a
jury
trial.
we
may
entirely
request
for
a
jury
trial
but
here
again
the
court
--
i
see
my
time
has
been
up
for
a
while
and
i
haven't
covered
my
all
of
the
point
that
i
had
intended
to
cover,
i
hope
the
court
will
forgive
me
for
extending
my
time.
i
appreciate
the
additional
time.
