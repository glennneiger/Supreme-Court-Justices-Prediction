justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
really,
mr.
freedman,
it
comes
down
i
gather
part
from
your
brief
is
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitrators
award,
an
injunction
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
in
norris-laguardia
that
bars
federal
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunction
against
free
speech.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
under
the
guise
of
anything.
you
do
have
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
rely
on
my
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
dissented,
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
have
trouble
explaining
how
my
dissent
support
your
theory
to
say
that
one,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
on
what
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
to
you
with
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
what
justice
white
has
suggested
is
you
have
said
that
in
effect
that
which
brought
under
the
lawsuit
is
an
entirely
different
dispute
from
the
dispute
which
had
been
resolved
in
arbitration
sometime
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
therefore,
the
action
brought
by
the
employers
before
a
judge
body
was
in
the
essence,
nothing
more
than
an
action
to
restrain
a
work
stoppage
in
violation
of
the
contract.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
true,
then
why
isn't
justice
white
right
that
this
is
just
--
you're
trying
to
make
a
pure
sinclair
case
out
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
why
can't
you
question
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor
is
undoubtedly
correct
because
this
is
the
way
the
court
below
treated
it.
and
therefore,
assuming
that
the
court
was
correct
as
your
honor
points
out
now,
assuming
that
they
were
correct,
that
raises
the
sinclair
issue
very
squarely.
now,
if
i
may
just
briefly
scheme
over
some
of
the
highlights
and
before
i
get
to
the
legal
aspects
of
it,
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
--
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
you
haven't
set
up
the
ground
where
it's
pretty
effectively,
mr.
freedman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
if
like
justice
harlan
if
you
can't
get
that
question
you
are
asking
us
to
do
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
going
further
into
all
these
background
in
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
he
did
if
this
was
a
restraining
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
--
i
do
hope
mr.
freedman
that
you're
going
to
get
to
the
questions
that
you
hope
that
we're
going
to
--
help
to
decide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
hoping.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
that,
mr.
freedman
that
there
might
be
under
301
an
order
directing
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
directing
arbitration.
there
was
no
arbitration
in
that
case.
you've
just
said
that
sinclair
referred
to.
i
don't
think
it
did,
did
it?
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitrator's
award,
it
was
--
you
can
have
an
order
requiring
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
isn't
that
what
sinclair
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you're
wrong,
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
wrong,
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
distinguish
it.
