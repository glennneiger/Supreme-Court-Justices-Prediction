justice

fortas
apart
from
that,
and
up
here,
you
had
a
court
order
since
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
wasn't
there
a
court
order
enforcing
the
arbitrator's
award
before
it
always
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
the
issue
here
--
isn't
the
issue
here
how
you
can
test
it
on
different
sets
of
facts
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
you
could
go
back
to
the
arbitrator
or
to
the
court
but
the
issue
is
whether
an
apparent
plain
violation
of
the
court's
order,
you
can
resort
to
self-help
because
what
you
say
is
a
different
set
of
facts.
that's
seems
to
me
to
be
the
issue.
would
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
--
nobody
is
quarrelling
with
that
in
here.(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
court's
order
of
contempt
was
not
based
upon
you're
going
back
to
the
arbitrator,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
based
upon
the
work
stoppage,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
right
or
wrong?
what's
the
contempt
order
based
on?
is
a
contempt
order,
based
on
your
going
back
to
the
arbitrator
or
is
it
based
upon
the
work
stoppage
in
alleged
contravention
of
the
court's
order?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
--
were
there
alternatives
as
to
how
you
comply
with
such
an
order?
you
mean
the
court
said,
“i
enforce
the
arbitrators'
award,”
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
they
--
is
there
–
do
you
have
a
choice
as
to
how
you
comply
with
the
arbitrator's
award?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
problem
here?
what
was
the
ambiguity?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
mean
it
was
still
unclear
that
he
might
say,
“i
enforce
the
arbitrator's
award
but
you
found
this
that
it
could
still
engage
in
a
work
stoppage
to
contest
the
arbitrator's
award.
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
the
order
appears
on
page
113
of
the
record,
doesn't
it?
and
the
order
says
that
or
the
judge
says
that
the
arbitration
award
is
enforced
on
let's
say
dependent,
meaning
your
union
is
hereby
ordered
to
comply
with
and
to
abide
by
the
said
award.
and
i
--
is
it
your
suggestion
that
there
are
some
ambiguity
as
whether
that
means
that
you
can
contest
the
award
by
work
stoppage?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
this
order
is
governed
or
is
not
governed
by
rule
65(d)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
65(d),
then
you
do
agree
that
it
is
an
order
granting
an
injunction?
justice
abe
fortas
an
injunction
against
what?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
seem
to
be
able
to
have
construed
that
order
with
some
clarity
and
precision
right
now.
it
couldn't
have
been
anything
else.
could
it
have
been
a,
except
an
injunction
to
prevent
a
work
stoppage
which
would
interfere
with
the
carrying
out
of
the
arbitrator's
award
whether
or
not
the
legal
conclusion
follows
of
that
norris
laguardia.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
it's
not
in
your
questions
presented
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh
in
the
second
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
in
the
first
case
here,
you
were
assessed
to
find
them
a
$100,000
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
second
one?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
was
asking
you
about,
sir.
i
don't
see
that
you
have
attacked
that.
the
assessment
of
that
fine
either
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
a
contempt
or
whether
or
it
was
a
punishment
or
whether
it
was
a
civil
contempt
or
criminal
contempt.
you
have
not
raised
that
question
have
you,
in
either
of
your
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
you
haven't
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is

justice
abe
fortas
so
you
haven't
raised
it.

you
raised

you?

fortas

fortas
not

is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
show
it
to
me.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
judge's
action
when
he
held
that
--
when
the
alleged
contempt
and
said
the
union
has
to
pay
a
$100,000
a
day
or
whether
you
don't
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
that
the
particular
form
of
his
action
was
justified
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
it
was
a
civil
contempt
or
a
criminal
contempt.
