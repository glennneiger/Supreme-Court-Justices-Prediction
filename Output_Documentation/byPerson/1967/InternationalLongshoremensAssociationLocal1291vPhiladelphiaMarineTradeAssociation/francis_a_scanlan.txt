mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
an
arbitrator's
award
was
rendered
under
an
interpretation
of
our
contract.
this
interpretation
was
supposed
to
last
for
the
entire
extent
of
the
contract.
it
was
not
a
situation
which
related
to
any
specific
dispute.
the
arbitrator
in
a
most
comprehensive
opinion
considered
all
of
the
contentions
which
were
raised
by
all
of
the
parties
including
the
contention
that
was
raised
regarding
the
so-called
“inclement
weather
clause”.
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
on
page
24
of
the
record,
the
arbitrators
specifically
referred
to
the
section
9(h)
the
so-called
“inclement
weather
clause”
and
he
stated
it
was
the
union's
further
contention
that
section
9(h)
of
the
previous
collective
bargaining
agreement
remained
intact
except
for
the
modification
contained
in
section
10(5)
of
memorandum
of
settlement
so
that
the
award
covered
all
the
contentions.
it
was
clear
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
action
was
taken
by
the
union
to
set
aside
the
award
for
any
grounds
whatsoever.
so
the
award
at
the
present
time,
the
merits
of
the
award
are
not
subject
to
review.
this
is
clear
under
this
court's
decisions
and
the
steel
workers
trilogy
cases
and
particularly
the
enterprise
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
facts
--
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
now,
the
award,
mr.
justice
stewart,
actually
said
that
the
employer
association,
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
which
is
the
collective
bargaining
agent
here
for
all
employers,
has
a
right
to
set-back
the
gangs
without
qualification.
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
what
the
award
did,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
this.
under
the
old
contract,
the
men
were
hired
on
a
daily
basis.
they
reported
how
to
shape
off.
if
they
were
not
hired
for
a
particular
day,
they
do
not
receive
any
pay.
now,
under
the
contract
which
the
award
enforce,
they
were
hired
the
day
before
and
once
they
were
hired,
if
they
were
set-back,
they
were
guaranteed
at
least
five
hours
pay
and
the
award,
when
it
said
that
the
employers
have
a
right
to
set-back
without
qualification
with
respect
to
the
pay
off
provisions,
it
meant
this,
that
all
longshoremen
who
were
set-back
for
any
reason
whatsoever
were
entitled
to
at
least
five
hours
pay
and
this
was
something
which
they
do
not
have
before.
now,
with
respect
to
the
action
that
was
taken
by
the
union
after
this
award
was
entered,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
union
came
out.
there
was
nothing
nebulous
about
it.
there's
nothing
subtle
about
it.
the
union
came
out
and
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
abide
by
this
award
and
the
award
itself
was
final
and
binding.
the
parties
agreed
that
it
would
be
final
and
binding.
but
the
union
on
two
separate
occasions
before
this
court
order
was
entered,
specifically
said
that
they
did
not
like
the
award;
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
bound
by
the
award.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
this
action
was
taken
in
the
first
instance
because
of
the
statements
that
were
made
by
the
officers
of
the
union
that
they
absolutely
would
not
comply
with
this
award.
now,
at
the
first
hearing,
it
was
admitted
by
counsel
for
the
union
that
the
union
was
bound
by
the
award
and
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
had
ruled
against
the
union
that
the
union
would
have
to
comply
with
the
award.
this
is
the
reason
why
the
hearing
was
continued.
now,
after
that,
on
september
the
13th,
1965
and
here
is
an
illustration
of
what
the
union
actually
did.
the
men
were
set-back.
the
gangs
were
told
to
report
at
1
o'clock
but
the
president
of
the
union
took
it
upon
himself
to
use
the
microphone
at
the
central
dispatching
office
and
he
notified
all
gangs
which
were
set
back
for
that
particular
day
and
who
were
supposed
to
report
at
1
o'clock
that
afternoon,
he
told
them,
“do
not
report
at
1
o'clock;
report
at
8
o'clock
tomorrow
morning.”
and
he
told
other
gangs,
which
have
been
cancelled
that
day
and
there
was
no
question
about
the
cancellation
rights.
these
gangs
were
told
to
come
back
the
next
day.
there
was
no
dispute
about
it.
he
told
those
gangs
to
report
for
work
at
1
o'clock
that
afternoon.
so
here
we
had
a
most
specific
violation
of
the
arbitrator's
award
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
order
was
issued
at
the
hearing
on
september
the
15th.
now,
this
testimony
regarding
the
action
by
the
president
of
the
union
was
uncontradicted.as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
of
the
testimony,
of
our
testimony
at
the
first
hearing
and
at
the
second
hearing
was
uncontradicted,
so
that
the
award,
the
order
of
the
court
was
issued,
specifically
enforcing
the
award
and
notifying
the
union
to
comply
with
and
to
abide
by
that
award.
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
no,
i
don't.
rule
65(d)
applies
only
to
restraining
orders
or
injunctions.
and
as
i
read
the
rule,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
restraining
order
and
it
is
not
an
injunction
within
the
contemplation
of
that
rule.
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
this
is
an
action
for
specific
performance
which
is
different
from
the
restraining
order
or
an
injunction.
and
even,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
in
this
case?
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
it
ordered
the
union
to
specifically
enforce
the
award
and
to
comply
with
and
to
abide
by
that
award.
now,
with
respect
to
rule
65(d),
even
if
it
is
construed
to
be
a
mandatory
injunction,
which
this
court
has
stated
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
and
the
sinclair
case,
it's
not
proscribed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
believe
that
the
order
still
complied
with
rule
65(d)
because
it
set
forth
what
the
union
was
supposed
to
do
in
clear
and
unmistakable
terms.
they
were
told
to
do
one
thing
to
abide
by
the
award
and
the
reason
why
they
were
told
to
do
that
is
that
was
the
only
issue
that
was
before
the
court.
the
court
had
the
testimony
before
it
as
i
have
stated
that
the
union
said
they
did
not
intend
to
abide
by
the
award.
they
didn't
like
it.
they
weren't
bound
by
it
and
the
award
simply
carried
out
the
testimony
that
the
judge
had
in
which
he
told
the
union
that
it
had
to
comply
with
this
award
and
it
was
bound
by
it.
and
that's
the
reason
why
i
think
that
it
does
comply
with
rule
65(d).
now,
as
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
concerned,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award.
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
--
mr.
francis
a.
scanlan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
an
arbitrator's

it
