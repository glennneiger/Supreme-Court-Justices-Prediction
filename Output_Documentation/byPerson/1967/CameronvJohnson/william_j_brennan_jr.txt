justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
at
all,
mr.
smith,
that
in
any
event,
the
declaratory
judgment
--
this
federal
district
court
should
have
given
you
declaratory
judgment
on
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
from
the
injunction?
i
mean,
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
dealt
with
in
cuder
(ph).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
cuder
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
then
why
do
you
get
involved
with
2283
at
all
in
dombrowski
or
dombrowski
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
if
it's
--
if
it's
--
at
least
it
it's
on
the
face
attack?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment
of
unconstitutionality
on
its
face,
i
expect
that
the
defense
of
the
prosecution
if
they
proceeded
with
it,
you
wouldn't
be
badly
off,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
challenge
here
is
facially
to
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
significance
of
the
amendment?
i
didn't
catch
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that's
vague,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
at
71.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
my
question,
whether
it
would
help
us
understand
where
this
lady
was,
where
the
walk
is
so
to
help
us
understand
what
the
layout
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
the
--
the
several
entrances
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
that
point,
it
says
3.8.
is
that
a
building?
i
notice
north
of
the
line
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
the
width
of
the
walk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
--
i
forgot
to
say
it
in.
what
building
was
she
leaving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
entrance
she
was
leaving?
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
she
was
coming
out
of
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
where
it
says
6.7
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
was
the
picket
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
she
stepped
into
the
line
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
walked
right
along
that
walk
6.7
feet
wide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
line
where
the
march
passed
that's
a
point
where
it
says
3.8
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
she
stepped
into
the
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that's
only
wide
enough
for
one
person
at
3.8.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
at
