mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
time
i
have
left,
i'll
start
the
argument,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
what
we
regard
as
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
or
as
judge
rives
has
put
it
in
his
opinion,
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
the
facts
as
proved
require
the
granting
of
the
injunctive
relief
requested.
or
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
second
question
in
the
remand
to
the
district
court
whether
the
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
in
light
of
the
criteria
set
forth
in
dombrowski.
for
as
mr.
smith
has
argued
here
and
as
judge
rives
put
so
succinctly
in
his
opinion,
the
essence
of
the
2283
problem
is
that
the
principles
of
comity
which
are
codified
in
2283
embody
the
concept
of
the
primacy
of
the
federal
courts
in
protecting
fundamental
federal
rights
expressed
in
the
1871
act,
now
of
course
1983
which
this
court
developed
soulfully
in
this
(inaudible)
decision
in
this
term.
if
those
criteria
are
met,
then
the
fundamental
principles
which
govern
the
federal
system
require
not
sanction
but
require
the
granting
of
the
injunctive
relief.
now,
the
approach
to
this
fundamental
question
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
governed
by
two
main
considerations.
this
case
for
the
first
time
comes
to
this
court
bottomed
fully
upon
an
evidentiary
record
and
an
evidentiary
record
fully
tried
which
the
appellees
--
which
mississippi
now
concedes
that
with
two
relatively
minor
exceptions,
our
statement
of
facts
in
the
brief
are
generally
correct
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
respect.
now,
we
suggest
this
is
a
rather
unusual
concession
by
appellees
because
the
statement
of
facts
which
emerged
from
the
evidentiary
hearing
presents
the
issue
to
this
court
in
the
following
matrix
of
events.
the
following
fundamental
conclusions
of
fact
upon
which
the
dombrowski
criteria
flowed.
first;
the
demonstrations
which
continued
over
a
period
of
four
months
or
for
the
purpose
of
protesting
discrimination
against
negro
citizens
in
voting
and
encouraging
negro
citizens
to
register
to
vote
were
at
all
times
entirely
peaceful,
conceded
by
mississippi.
secondly,
that
the
demonstrators
at
all
times
remained
within
the
express
area
designated
originally
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
who
had
themselves
selected
that
area
so
that
the
demonstrators,
when
marching,
would
not
obstruct
access
to
the
courthouse,
conceded
by
mississippi.
third;
that
this
statute
has
been
selectively
enforced
so
as
to
arrest
only
persons
engaged
in
these
activities,
conceded
by
mississippi.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
first
decisive
fact
which
emerges
from
the
evidentiary
hearing
upon
which
this
court
must
judge
the
criteria
of
dombrowski
is
that
the
statute
has
admittedly
and
open,
been
selectively
enforced
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights.
now,
the
facts
of
selective
enforcement
uncontested
and
testified
to
by
mississippi
state
authorities
at
the
hearing
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
situation
this
court
faced
in
cox
against
louisiana.
the
testimony
of
the
country
prosecuting
attorney,
mr.
dukes,
which
is
set
forth
in
page
74
of
our
brief
for
the
court's
convenience
was
that
parades
which
block
the
streets
and
obstruct
traffic
are
permitted
in
hattiesburg
and
have
been
permitted
by
arrangements
with
the
city
officials
and
that
there
are
no
standards
in
the
statute
or
anywhere
else
for
determination
by
the
officials
as
to
which
demonstration
to
permit,
that
there
are
no
permit
procedures
and
no
standards.
now,
as
this
court
said
in
cox
both
in
the
majority
and
in
the
concurring
opinions,
this
situation
is
the
clear
equivalent
of
a
statute
which
permits
officials
to
act
as
a
censor
and
that
the
pervasive
restraint
upon
freedom
of
expression,
or
as
this
court
put
it
in
dombrowski,
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
is
not
any
less
effective
than
a
statute
which
expressly
permits
such
selective
enforcement.
now,
what
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
so
shocking
here
on
this
hearing,
is
that
the
testimony
admittedly
adduced
by
the
mississippi
officials
vividly
illustrates
the
constitutional
evil
in
selective
enforcement
which
this
court
has
condemned
from
edwards
to
cox
and
which
every
member
of
this
court
has
adhered
to
whether
in
its
dissenting
opinions
or
majority
opinions,
that
this
constitutional
evil
is
embraced
by
the
appellees
and
the
majority
below
as
the
very
justification
for
this
selective
enforcement.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
definitely
not,
your
honor,
no.
this
court
is
sharply
split
on
this
question,
let
that
question
open
in
cox
and
your
honor
has
expressed
yourself
very
strongly
on
that
issue.
this
court
however
and
your
honor
in
cox
and
your
honor
dissenting
in
brown-louisiana
and
your
honor
writing
the
majority
in
adderley
has
said
at
a
minimum,
there
must
be
evenhanded
application
of
a
state
statute.
this
testimony
shows
concededly
that
there
has
not
been
evenhanded
application.
if
the
majority
of
this
court
in
adderley
is
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
this
statute
must
be
restrained
because
concededly,
mississippi
has
stated
in
open
hearing
that
the
statute
has
not
been
evenhandedly
enforced
and
they
explained
why.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
ask
for
injunctive
relief
against
the
pending
criminal
prosecutions
which
are
part
of
a
prosecutorial
plan,
mr.
justice
white's
words
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
cameron
itself,
part
of
a
plan
of
a
prosecutor
to
misuse
this
statute.
selective
enforcement,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
is
the
classic
example
of
a
prosecutor's
misuse
of
a
statute.
now,
judge
coleman
below
for
the
majority
explained
that
of
course
there
was
this
selective
enforcement,
but
it
was
alright.
why?
because
he
says
here
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
parades
carried
on
by
common
consent
on
the
public
streets.
and
mr.
wells,
the
attorney
--
assistant
attorney
general
of
mississippi
at
the
hearing
stated
that
the
critical
difference
between
those
activities,
your
honor,
which
admittedly
violated
the
statute,
obstructed
the
streets
like
the
parades,
and
those
activities
of
our
clients,
the
black
citizens
of
mississippi
and
their
white
supporters,
the
critical
difference
was
that
they
were
a
different
type
of
activity.
they
had
a
different
purpose.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
position
of
the
appellees
and
the
majority
below
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
first
amendment
because
this
court
has
taught
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
merely
permit
activities
which
the
majority
of
a
community
approves
of
by
common
consent,
that
it
put
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice,
yesterday
afternoon,
we
were
discussing
the
constitutional
implications
of
the
opened
concession
of
mississippi
that
the
statute
here
under
consideration
has
been
selectively
enforced
in
the
area
of
free
expression.
here,
mississippi
has
openly
acknowledged
that
if
a
parade
which
completely
obstructs
a
street
has
general
community
approval,
the
statute
will
not
be
enforced.
but
if
it
has
a
different
purpose,
perhaps
one
in
sharp
opposition
to
what
this
court
has
called
in
button,
the
opinions
of
the
politically
dominant
white
community,
the
statute
will
be
enforced.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
concession
is
directly
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
black
at
page
--
it's
set
forth
in
full
on
page
74
in
our
brief.
the
excerpts
from
the
transcript
are
on
page
74
of
our
brief.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
open
complete
concession.
now,
what
mississippi
attempts
to
do
here
is
precisely
what
louisiana
attempted
to
do
before
this
court
in
cox
and
that
is
the
effort
to
say
that
a
parade
is
not
a
mass
demonstration
but
as
this
court
there
pointed
out,
a
parade
as
the
dictionary
itself
had
--
a
mass
demonstration
as
the
dictionary
itself
points
out
is
a
public
manifestation
of
feeling.
now,
if
this
public
manifestation
of
feeling
expresses
safe,
dominant
community
views,
then
it's
permissible.
if
it
expresses
unpopular
views
such
as
opposition
to
the
dominant
majorities,
disenfranchisement
of
negroes,
then
it
is
semantically
a
mass
demonstration
prohibited
by
the
statute,
but
this
is
precisely
what
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
said
that
the
constitution
prohibits.
and
as
we
pointed
out
yesterday,
there
has
been
striking
unanimity
in
this
court
on
the
vice
of
discriminatory
enforcement
because
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
cox
that
discriminatory
enforcement
represents
censorship
in
its
most
odious
form
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
did
they
concede
that?
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
they
did
not
concede
that,
sir.
they
conceded
that
the
statute
was
selectively
enforced,
completely
selectively
enforced
and
the
--
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
on
page
236
of
the
transcript
on
the
examination
of
mr.
dukes
and
solicitor
in
respect
to
the
homecoming
parade
for
mississippi
southern,
the
question
was
asked,
“did
the
parade
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse?”
it
did.
the
question,
“was
it
during
daylight
hours?”
answer,
“during
the
daylight
hours.”
question,
“when
the
courthouse
was
normally
open
for
business?”
a,
“normally
open
for
business.”
question,
“did
it
keep
people
from
being
able
to
cross
the
street
from
the
sears
roebuck
to
the
courthouse?
answer,
“it
did,”
so
that
there
is
equal
concession,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
respect
to
blocking
the
courthouse.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
only
possible
conclusion
from
these
open
record
concessions
is
that
concededly
mississippi
is
not
engaging
in
the
evenhanded
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
the
utterly
majority
of
this
court
required
as
a
constitutional
minimal
protection.
and
that
if
federal
judicial
protection
is
not
available
where
admittedly
there
is
no
evenhanded
enforcement
of
a
state
statute,
then
i
suggest
to
the
court
the
somber
warning
of
the
dissent
in
utterly
must
be
carefully
reconsidered.
this
is
one
of
the
most
classic
examples
which
a
transcript
has
ever
brought
before
this
court
of
planned
prosecutorial
misuse
of
a
statute
regulating
freedom
of
expression.
this
is
one
of
the
two
types
of
challenges
to
a
state
criminal
statute
which
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
original
cameron
case
warrants
extraordinary
federal
intervention
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
pattern
of
selective
enforcement
raises
a
second
consideration
which
emerged
sharply
at
the
remand
hearing
which
likewise
invokes
the
criteria
of
dombrowski.
now,
this
court
has
taught
us
in
a
numerable
opinion
that
the
danger
of
selective
enforcement
often
flows
from
statutes
overly
broad
or
vague
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
such
a
statute
is
now
clearly
before
this
court.
at
the
remand
hearing,
the
appellees
introduced
an
amended
statute
and
it's
there
exhibit
at
104
of
the
appendix
house
bill
114
which
is
now
before
this
court
for
consideration
for
the
first
time.
this
is
a
wholly
different
statute
now
than
the
statute
which
was
before
the
court
on
the
original
cameron
consideration
and
the
difference
is
dramatically
summarized
in
the
new
title
of
the
statute
which
is
an
act
to
prohibit
unreasonable
interference
with
free
ingress
to
and
from
any
public
buildings,
premises,
courthouses,
public
streets
and
sidewalks,
and
the
word
as
the
court
will
notice
unreasonably
is
now
inserted
into
the
text
of
the
statute
so
that
it
prohibits
picketing
or
mass
demonstrations
which
unreasonably
obstruct
or
interfere.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
while
this
statute
was
approved
on
july
9,
1964
by
a
legislature,
it
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
original
three-judge
court
or
to
the
appellants
or
to
this
court
on
the
original
review
so
that
the
opinions
dissenting
in
cameron
of
both
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white
deal
only
with
the
original
text
of
this
statute.
only
on
the
remand
hearing
was
the
amended
statute
called
to
the
attention
of
the
three-judge
court
and
the
appellants,
plaintiff
below,
and
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
significance
of
the
amendment,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
what
is
prohibited
now
is
not
obstruction
or
interference
but
unreasonable
obstruction
or
interference
and
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
raises
--
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
judge
coleman
raised
that
question
in
the
majority
opinion
below.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
illustrates
sharply
why
the
vice
of
unconstitutional
vagueness
is
here
present
because
as
your
honor
pointed
out
for
this
court
in
the
recent
search
and
seizure
opinion
in
this
term,
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
except
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
with
certain
few
well-defined
exceptions
meant
that
you
could
not
give
to
a
police
officer
the
right
to
determine
what
was
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
but
quite
to
the
contrary,
it
was
a
duty
of
an
independent
magistrate
to
rule
in
advance
on
an
application
for
a
warrant
as
the
katz
case.
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
you
honor
that
we
have
the
precise
problem
here.
what's
the
word
unreasonable
introduced
into
the
face
of
the
statute
does?
it
does
what
mr.
justice
black
suggests
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
cox.
it
gives
to
the
policemen
on
the
beat
the
power
to
decide
to
make
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
what
he
believes
subjectively
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
whether
or
not
given
picketing
or
whether
or
not
given
demonstrating
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
this
is
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
as
it
formally
did.
it
was
amended
on
july
4th.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
july
9th,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
these
particular
prosecutions
are
under
the
original
statute.
the
relief
we
seek
is
injunctive
and
declaratory
judgment
relief
against
the
original
and
now
amended
statute.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
court
below,
mr.
justice
stewart,
took
judicial
notice
of
the
amended
statute
and
the
amended
statute
was
the
statute
before
the
court
on
remand
below.
so
that
statute
i
would
suggest
is
of
course
properly
here.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
that
this
statute
under
dombrowski
--
that
this
statute
now
as
written
--
see,
we
acknowledge,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
there
is
a
sharp
division
in
the
court
and
below
on
the
facial
constitutional
issue
as
to
the
original
statute.
that
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
dissenting
opinion
on
the
remand
and
the
difference
of
opinion
expressed
by
judge
rives
below
and
the
opinions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white.
we
suggest
that
no
such
difference
of
opinion
can
exist
today
as
to
the
amended
statute,
that
whatever
differences
existed
before
now
totally
vague
and
why?
because
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
precisely,
mr.
justice
stewart.
our
position
is,
and
the
record
bears
it
out,
that
mississippi
interpreted
the
original
statute
as
if
it
gave
the
arresting
officer
the
huge
undefined
leeway
which
the
word
“unreasonable”
now
clearly
gives
it.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
only
point,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
that
we
say
now
that
mississippi
has
made
it
very
clear
what
their
intention
was.
their
intention
was
to
write
a
sweeping
overbroad
and
vague
statute.
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
their
amendment.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
transcript
which
we
had
set
out
for
the
court's
convenience
on
page
86
and
87
of
our
brief
points
out
this
extraordinary
discussion
between
the
county
solicitor
and
the
examining
attorney
where
the
county
solicitor
mr.
dukess
in
discussing
how
he
would
enforce,
the
statute
says
the
question
--
and
these
are
his
words
--
the
question
of
what
is
reasonable
i
believe,
mr.
smith,
is
one
that
people
differ
on.
but
this
is
the
heart
of
the
problem
of
vagueness
in
the
first
amendment
area
because
such
a
statute
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
cox
does
not
provide
for
government
by
clearly
defined
laws
but
rather
for
government
by
the
moment
to
moment
opinions
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
think
it
might
be
possible,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
very
carefully
drawn
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
very,
very
carefully
drawn
with
very,
very
careful
limitations.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
that
would
be
a
little
difficult
at
this
moment
for
me
to
phrase
fully,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'd
want
to
write
it
out
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
--
i
would
put
it
in
its
negative,
if
i
may,
justice
fortas.
i
would
say
that
i
would
make
sure
that
this
statute
guaranteed
the
opportunity
for
full
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
under
reasonable
conditions
but
that
conditions
were
spelled
out
so
that
a
policeman
doesn't
make
the
determination.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh,
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
my
statute.
i
would
spell
out
the
criteria
precisely,
and
that's
what
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
the
edwards
case
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
warrants
so
sharply
against,
that
if
such
a
statute
is
to
be
written,
it
must
be
precise.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
that
problem
is
not
here
presented
in
this
case.
as
this
case
quite
clearly
shows
the
precise
--
precisely
reversed
situation,
precisely
reversed.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
also
agree
as
you
have
pointed
out
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
agree
to
that.
i
also
agree
that
the
fundamental
values
of
the
first
amendment
must
always
be
fully
protected
and
that
on
a
record
as
this
where
people
in
the
first
place
where
a
statute
is
not
being
evenhandedly
enforced,
it
must
fall
that
secondly
whereas
judge
rives
points
out
in
his
opinion
below
and
has
the
record
so
clearly
indicates
and
as
mississippi
concedes,
these
peaceful
demonstrators,
negro
and
white
citizens
calling
for
the
vindication
of
their
most
fundamental
constitutional
federal
rights
are
walking
in
the
very
spot
in
which
law
enforcement
officers
for
two
months
have
told
them
it
was
proper
to
walk
that
under
those
conditions
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
when
county
officials
have
for
two
months
blocked
of
a
certain
--
if
you
would
look
at
the
diagram
which
judge
rives
of
course
has
attached
to
his
dissenting
opinion
which
is
in
the
record,
a
diagram
of
the
forrest
county
courthouse,
if
for
two
months
county
officials
have
said
that
this
is
the
area
in
which
if
you
walk
here
it
does
not
obstruct
the
main
entrance
to
the
courthouse
that
yes,
under
cox
and
every
other
opinion
of
this
court,
it
would
be
as
this
court
has
said
indefensible
entrapment
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
after
that
pattern
of
time,
it's
permissible
to
enforce
a
criminal
sanction
against
people
peacefully
expressing
their
views.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh
no,
he
can't
make
it
a
law.
that
law
was
made
when
the
bill
of
rights,
your
honor,
was
adopted.
the
law
which
sanctioned
the
demonstrations
was
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
law
that
says
that
people
have
the
right
to
peacefully
assemble,
express
themselves,
and
petition
their
government
for
regress
of
grievances.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
but
it
does
say
that
the
state
may
not
say
some
people
can
do
it
and
other
people
may
not.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
--
and
that's
the
issue,
mr.
justice
black.
this
case
presents
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
two
months,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
and
we're
all
precisely
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
precisely
our
point
because
the
enactment
of
the
law
was
designed
as
the
court
said
in
brown
against
louisiana
was
designed
and
had
the
actual
effect
of
stopping
and
cutting
off
otherwise
peaceful
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
making
it
illegal
to
engage
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
ah!
but
what
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
which
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
which
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
stewart,
makes
this
situation
doubly
serious
because
it's
extremely
interesting.
judge
coleman
in
his
findings
of
fact
said
that
up
until
april
10th
when
the
first
arrest
took
place,
the
picketing
was
peaceful
and
protected
activities.
on
examination,
mr.
dukes
said
that
if
the
law
had
been
in
effect
prior
to
april
10,
the
demonstrators
would
have
been
guilty
of
violating
the
law.
in
other
words,
the
law
itself
was
designed
to
cut
off
peaceful,
protected
activities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
but
what
the
transcript
below
shows,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
what
this
court
pointed
out
in
button
was
so
important
in
considering
the
operation
of
a
statute,
its
setting
and
the
way
it
operated.
let
me
make
this
suggestion,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
rather
amazing
that
the
majority
below
and
the
appellees
do
not
discuss
the
arrests
which
took
place
on
the
afternoon
of
april
10
and
the
morning
of
april
11
and
the
morning
of
may
18.
they
simply
do
not
discuss
them.
why?
because
these
arrests
were
of
seven
people,
seven
people
with
not
a
single
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record.
they
didn't
even
attempt
to
show
obstruction
of
anything
whatsoever.
and
as
judge
rives
points
out
below,
he
uses
the
word
“fantastic”.
he
says
it's
incredibly
fantastic
to
believe
that
the
arrests
of
seven
people
carrying
signs
saying
“mississippians
are
americans,
too”
and
“we
demand
the
right
to
vote”
could
conceivably
be
the
violation
of
any
state
law.
now,
we
suggest
that
this
is
highly
significant
because
this
shows
the
way
in
which
the
mississippi
authorities
utilized
the
statute,
assuming
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
we
do
not
because
the
court
is
aware
of
our
position
of
challenging
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
both
originally
and
as
amended,
particularly
as
amended.
but
assuming
a
valid
statute
here,
under
the
second
branch
of
dombrowkski,
i
would
suggest
that
nothing
is
clearer
as
judge
rives
points
out
a
pattern
of
utilization
of
a
conceivably
valid
state
statute
to
harass
the
exercise
of
civil
rights
and
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
probably
ten
statutes
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
they
are
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
they're
also
cited
in
the
court's
opinion
in
peacock.
there
are
a
whole
host
of
statutes
which
were
available
to
the
mississippi
authorities,
which
if
these
individuals
were
really
blocking
the
ingress
to
that
courthouse
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
could
have
been
invoked
by
the
mississippi
authorities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
think
yours,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
charges
which
the
peacock
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
plaintiffs
who
are
being
removed
on,
yes.
you
cited
them
sir,
i
believe,
in
your
opinion.
now,
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
the
record
shows
in
light
now
that
mississippi
has
in
fact
interpreted
the
statute
as
if
it
had
an
overbroad
sweep
bringing
into
its
orbit
protected
first
amendment
and
civil
rights
activities,
that
the
full
criteria
of
dombrowski
under
both
the
first
branch
and
the
second
branch
are
met.
the
only
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
in
conclusion
is
that
what
is
most
serious
here
is
the
final
suggestion
of
the
majority
below
that
federal
relief
should
be
denied
because
picketing
in
mississippi
to
obtain
a
vote
and
to
encourage
others
to
do
so
is
a
thing
of
the
past.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
the
coroner
commission
report
pointed
out
just
two
days
ago,
country
stands
at
a
crossroads,
that
at
this
moment
in
mississippi
and
throughout
the
nation,
a
strengthening
of
federal
power
to
protect
the
peaceful
utilization
of
first
amendment
liberties
in
the
solution
of
fundamental
problems
which
rift
this
nation
is
the
highest
duty
and
obligation
of
this
court.
that
to
deny
relief
today
in
this
case
would
be
to
advocate
the
higher
responsibility
of
the
federal
national
judiciary.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
time
i
have
left,
i'll
start
the
argument,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
what
we
regard
as
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
or
as
judge
rives
has
put
it
in
his
opinion,
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
the
facts
as
proved
require
the
granting
of
the
injunctive
relief
requested.
or
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
second
question
in
the
remand
to
the
district
court
whether
the
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
in
light
of
the
criteria
set
forth
in
dombrowski.
for
as
mr.
smith
has
argued
here
and
as
judge
rives
put
so
succinctly
in
his
opinion,
the
essence
of
the
2283
problem
is
that
the
principles
of
comity
which
are
codified
in
2283
embody
the
concept
of
the
primacy
of
the
federal
courts
in
protecting
fundamental
federal
rights
expressed
in
the
1871
act,
now
of
course
1983
which
this
court
developed
soulfully
in
this
(inaudible)
decision
in
this
term.
if
those
criteria
are
met,
then
the
fundamental
principles
which
govern
the
federal
system
require
not
sanction
but
require
the
granting
of
the
injunctive
relief.
now,
the
approach
to
this
fundamental
question
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
governed
by
two
main
considerations.
this
case
for
the
first
time
comes
to
this
court
bottomed
fully
upon
an
evidentiary
record
and
an
evidentiary
record
fully
tried
which
the
appellees
--
which
mississippi
now
concedes
that
with
two
relatively
minor
exceptions,
our
statement
of
facts
in
the
brief
are
generally
correct
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
respect.
now,
we
suggest
this
is
a
rather
unusual
concession
by
appellees
because
the
statement
of
facts
which
emerged
from
the
evidentiary
hearing
presents
the
issue
to
this
court
in
the
following
matrix
of
events.
the
following
fundamental
conclusions
of
fact
upon
which
the
dombrowski
criteria
flowed.
first;
the
demonstrations
which
continued
over
a
period
of
four
months
or
for
the
purpose
of
protesting
discrimination
against
negro
citizens
in
voting
and
encouraging
negro
citizens
to
register
to
vote
were
at
all
times
entirely
peaceful,
conceded
by
mississippi.
secondly,
that
the
demonstrators
at
all
times
remained
within
the
express
area
designated
originally
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
who
had
themselves
selected
that
area
so
that
the
demonstrators,
when
marching,
would
not
obstruct
access
to
the
courthouse,
conceded
by
mississippi.
third;
that
this
statute
has
been
selectively
enforced
so
as
to
arrest
only
persons
engaged
in
these
activities,
conceded
by
mississippi.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
first
decisive
fact
which
emerges
from
the
evidentiary
hearing
upon
which
this
court
must
judge
the
criteria
of
dombrowski
is
that
the
statute
has
admittedly
and
open,
been
selectively
enforced
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights.
now,
the
facts
of
selective
enforcement
uncontested
and
testified
to
by
mississippi
state
authorities
at
the
hearing
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
situation
this
court
faced
in
cox
against
louisiana.
the
testimony
of
the
country
prosecuting
attorney,
mr.
dukes,
which
is
set
forth
in
page
74
of
our
brief
for
the
court's
convenience
was
that
parades
which
block
the
streets
and
obstruct
traffic
are
permitted
in
hattiesburg
and
have
been
permitted
by
arrangements
with
the
city
officials
and
that
there
are
no
standards
in
the
statute
or
anywhere
else
for
determination
by
the
officials
as
to
which
demonstration
to
permit,
that
there
are
no
permit
procedures
and
no
standards.
now,
as
this
court
said
in
cox
both
in
the
majority
and
in
the
concurring
opinions,
this
situation
is
the
clear
equivalent
of
a
statute
which
permits
officials
to
act
as
a
censor
and
that
the
pervasive
restraint
upon
freedom
of
expression,
or
as
this
court
put
it
in
dombrowski,
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
is
not
any
less
effective
than
a
statute
which
expressly
permits
such
selective
enforcement.
now,
what
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
so
shocking
here
on
this
hearing,
is
that
the
testimony
admittedly
adduced
by
the
mississippi
officials
vividly
illustrates
the
constitutional
evil
in
selective
enforcement
which
this
court
has
condemned
from
edwards
to
cox
and
which
every
member
of
this
court
has
adhered
to
whether
in
its
dissenting
opinions
or
majority
opinions,
that
this
constitutional
evil
is
embraced
by
the
appellees
and
the
majority
below
as
the
very
justification
for
this
selective
enforcement.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
definitely
not,
your
honor,
no.
this
court
is
sharply
split
on
this
question,
let
that
question
open
in
cox
and
your
honor
has
expressed
yourself
very
strongly
on
that
issue.
this
court
however
and
your
honor
in
cox
and
your
honor
dissenting
in
brown-louisiana
and
your
honor
writing
the
majority
in
adderley
has
said
at
a
minimum,
there
must
be
evenhanded
application
of
a
state
statute.
this
testimony
shows
concededly
that
there
has
not
been
evenhanded
application.
if
the
majority
of
this
court
in
adderley
is
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
this
statute
must
be
restrained
because
concededly,
mississippi
has
stated
in
open
hearing
that
the
statute
has
not
been
evenhandedly
enforced
and
they
explained
why.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
ask
for
injunctive
relief
against
the
pending
criminal
prosecutions
which
are
part
of
a
prosecutorial
plan,
mr.
justice
white's
words
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
cameron
itself,
part
of
a
plan
of
a
prosecutor
to
misuse
this
statute.
selective
enforcement,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
is
the
classic
example
of
a
prosecutor's
misuse
of
a
statute.
now,
judge
coleman
below
for
the
majority
explained
that
of
course
there
was
this
selective
enforcement,
but
it
was
alright.
why?
because
he
says
here
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
parades
carried
on
by
common
consent
on
the
public
streets.
and
mr.
wells,
the
attorney
--
assistant
attorney
general
of
mississippi
at
the
hearing
stated
that
the
critical
difference
between
those
activities,
your
honor,
which
admittedly
violated
the
statute,
obstructed
the
streets
like
the
parades,
and
those
activities
of
our
clients,
the
black
citizens
of
mississippi
and
their
white
supporters,
the
critical
difference
was
that
they
were
a
different
type
of
activity.
they
had
a
different
purpose.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
position
of
the
appellees
and
the
majority
below
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
first
amendment
because
this
court
has
taught
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
merely
permit
activities
which
the
majority
of
a
community
approves
of
by
common
consent,
that
it
put
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice,
yesterday
afternoon,
we
were
discussing
the
constitutional
implications
of
the
opened
concession
of
mississippi
that
the
statute
here
under
consideration
has
been
selectively
enforced
in
the
area
of
free
expression.
here,
mississippi
has
openly
acknowledged
that
if
a
parade
which
completely
obstructs
a
street
has
general
community
approval,
the
statute
will
not
be
enforced.
but
if
it
has
a
different
purpose,
perhaps
one
in
sharp
opposition
to
what
this
court
has
called
in
button,
the
opinions
of
the
politically
dominant
white
community,
the
statute
will
be
enforced.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
concession
is
directly
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
black
at
page
--
it's
set
forth
in
full
on
page
74
in
our
brief.
the
excerpts
from
the
transcript
are
on
page
74
of
our
brief.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
open
complete
concession.
now,
what
mississippi
attempts
to
do
here
is
precisely
what
louisiana
attempted
to
do
before
this
court
in
cox
and
that
is
the
effort
to
say
that
a
parade
is
not
a
mass
demonstration
but
as
this
court
there
pointed
out,
a
parade
as
the
dictionary
itself
had
--
a
mass
demonstration
as
the
dictionary
itself
points
out
is
a
public
manifestation
of
feeling.
now,
if
this
public
manifestation
of
feeling
expresses
safe,
dominant
community
views,
then
it's
permissible.
if
it
expresses
unpopular
views
such
as
opposition
to
the
dominant
majorities,
disenfranchisement
of
negroes,
then
it
is
semantically
a
mass
demonstration
prohibited
by
the
statute,
but
this
is
precisely
what
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
said
that
the
constitution
prohibits.
and
as
we
pointed
out
yesterday,
there
has
been
striking
unanimity
in
this
court
on
the
vice
of
discriminatory
enforcement
because
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
cox
that
discriminatory
enforcement
represents
censorship
in
its
most
odious
form
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
did
they
concede
that?
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
they
did
not
concede
that,
sir.
they
conceded
that
the
statute
was
selectively
enforced,
completely
selectively
enforced
and
the
--
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
on
page
236
of
the
transcript
on
the
examination
of
mr.
dukes
and
solicitor
in
respect
to
the
homecoming
parade
for
mississippi
southern,
the
question
was
asked,
“did
the
parade
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse?”
it
did.
the
question,
“was
it
during
daylight
hours?”
answer,
“during
the
daylight
hours.”
question,
“when
the
courthouse
was
normally
open
for
business?”
a,
“normally
open
for
business.”
question,
“did
it
keep
people
from
being
able
to
cross
the
street
from
the
sears
roebuck
to
the
courthouse?
answer,
“it
did,”
so
that
there
is
equal
concession,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
respect
to
blocking
the
courthouse.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
only
possible
conclusion
from
these
open
record
concessions
is
that
concededly
mississippi
is
not
engaging
in
the
evenhanded
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
the
utterly
majority
of
this
court
required
as
a
constitutional
minimal
protection.
and
that
if
federal
judicial
protection
is
not
available
where
admittedly
there
is
no
evenhanded
enforcement
of
a
state
statute,
then
i
suggest
to
the
court
the
somber
warning
of
the
dissent
in
utterly
must
be
carefully
reconsidered.
this
is
one
of
the
most
classic
examples
which
a
transcript
has
ever
brought
before
this
court
of
planned
prosecutorial
misuse
of
a
statute
regulating
freedom
of
expression.
this
is
one
of
the
two
types
of
challenges
to
a
state
criminal
statute
which
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
original
cameron
case
warrants
extraordinary
federal
intervention
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
pattern
of
selective
enforcement
raises
a
second
consideration
which
emerged
sharply
at
the
remand
hearing
which
likewise
invokes
the
criteria
of
dombrowski.
now,
this
court
has
taught
us
in
a
numerable
opinion
that
the
danger
of
selective
enforcement
often
flows
from
statutes
overly
broad
or
vague
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
such
a
statute
is
now
clearly
before
this
court.
at
the
remand
hearing,
the
appellees
introduced
an
amended
statute
and
it's
there
exhibit
at
104
of
the
appendix
house
bill
114
which
is
now
before
this
court
for
consideration
for
the
first
time.
this
is
a
wholly
different
statute
now
than
the
statute
which
was
before
the
court
on
the
original
cameron
consideration
and
the
difference
is
dramatically
summarized
in
the
new
title
of
the
statute
which
is
an
act
to
prohibit
unreasonable
interference
with
free
ingress
to
and
from
any
public
buildings,
premises,
courthouses,
public
streets
and
sidewalks,
and
the
word
as
the
court
will
notice
unreasonably
is
now
inserted
into
the
text
of
the
statute
so
that
it
prohibits
picketing
or
mass
demonstrations
which
unreasonably
obstruct
or
interfere.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
while
this
statute
was
approved
on
july
9,
1964
by
a
legislature,
it
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
original
three-judge
court
or
to
the
appellants
or
to
this
court
on
the
original
review
so
that
the
opinions
dissenting
in
cameron
of
both
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white
deal
only
with
the
original
text
of
this
statute.
only
on
the
remand
hearing
was
the
amended
statute
called
to
the
attention
of
the
three-judge
court
and
the
appellants,
plaintiff
below,
and
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
significance
of
the
amendment,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
what
is
prohibited
now
is
not
obstruction
or
interference
but
unreasonable
obstruction
or
interference
and
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
raises
--
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
judge
coleman
raised
that
question
in
the
majority
opinion
below.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
illustrates
sharply
why
the
vice
of
unconstitutional
vagueness
is
here
present
because
as
your
honor
pointed
out
for
this
court
in
the
recent
search
and
seizure
opinion
in
this
term,
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
except
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
with
certain
few
well-defined
exceptions
meant
that
you
could
not
give
to
a
police
officer
the
right
to
determine
what
was
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
but
quite
to
the
contrary,
it
was
a
duty
of
an
independent
magistrate
to
rule
in
advance
on
an
application
for
a
warrant
as
the
katz
case.
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
you
honor
that
we
have
the
precise
problem
here.
what's
the
word
unreasonable
introduced
into
the
face
of
the
statute
does?
it
does
what
mr.
justice
black
suggests
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
cox.
it
gives
to
the
policemen
on
the
beat
the
power
to
decide
to
make
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
what
he
believes
subjectively
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
whether
or
not
given
picketing
or
whether
or
not
given
demonstrating
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
this
is
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
as
it
formally
did.
it
was
amended
on
july
4th.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
july
9th,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
these
particular
prosecutions
are
under
the
original
statute.
the
relief
we
seek
is
injunctive
and
declaratory
judgment
relief
against
the
original
and
now
amended
statute.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
court
below,
mr.
justice
stewart,
took
judicial
notice
of
the
amended
statute
and
the
amended
statute
was
the
statute
before
the
court
on
remand
below.
so
that
statute
i
would
suggest
is
of
course
properly
here.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
that
this
statute
under
dombrowski
--
that
this
statute
now
as
written
--
see,
we
acknowledge,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
there
is
a
sharp
division
in
the
court
and
below
on
the
facial
constitutional
issue
as
to
the
original
statute.
that
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
dissenting
opinion
on
the
remand
and
the
difference
of
opinion
expressed
by
judge
rives
below
and
the
opinions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
white.
we
suggest
that
no
such
difference
of
opinion
can
exist
today
as
to
the
amended
statute,
that
whatever
differences
existed
before
now
totally
vague
and
why?
because
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
precisely,
mr.
justice
stewart.
our
position
is,
and
the
record
bears
it
out,
that
mississippi
interpreted
the
original
statute
as
if
it
gave
the
arresting
officer
the
huge
undefined
leeway
which
the
word
“unreasonable”
now
clearly
gives
it.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
only
point,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
that
we
say
now
that
mississippi
has
made
it
very
clear
what
their
intention
was.
their
intention
was
to
write
a
sweeping
overbroad
and
vague
statute.
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
their
amendment.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
transcript
which
we
had
set
out
for
the
court's
convenience
on
page
86
and
87
of
our
brief
points
out
this
extraordinary
discussion
between
the
county
solicitor
and
the
examining
attorney
where
the
county
solicitor
mr.
dukess
in
discussing
how
he
would
enforce,
the
statute
says
the
question
--
and
these
are
his
words
--
the
question
of
what
is
reasonable
i
believe,
mr.
smith,
is
one
that
people
differ
on.
but
this
is
the
heart
of
the
problem
of
vagueness
in
the
first
amendment
area
because
such
a
statute
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
cox
does
not
provide
for
government
by
clearly
defined
laws
but
rather
for
government
by
the
moment
to
moment
opinions
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
think
it
might
be
possible,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
very
carefully
drawn
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
very,
very
carefully
drawn
with
very,
very
careful
limitations.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
that
would
be
a
little
difficult
at
this
moment
for
me
to
phrase
fully,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'd
want
to
write
it
out
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
--
i
would
put
it
in
its
negative,
if
i
may,
justice
fortas.
i
would
say
that
i
would
make
sure
that
this
statute
guaranteed
the
opportunity
for
full
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
under
reasonable
conditions
but
that
conditions
were
spelled
out
so
that
a
policeman
doesn't
make
the
determination.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh,
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
my
statute.
i
would
spell
out
the
criteria
precisely,
and
that's
what
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
the
edwards
case
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
warrants
so
sharply
against,
that
if
such
a
statute
is
to
be
written,
it
must
be
precise.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
that
problem
is
not
here
presented
in
this
case.
as
this
case
quite
clearly
shows
the
precise
--
precisely
reversed
situation,
precisely
reversed.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
also
agree
as
you
have
pointed
out
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
agree
to
that.
i
also
agree
that
the
fundamental
values
of
the
first
amendment
must
always
be
fully
protected
and
that
on
a
record
as
this
where
people
in
the
first
place
where
a
statute
is
not
being
evenhandedly
enforced,
it
must
fall
that
secondly
whereas
judge
rives
points
out
in
his
opinion
below
and
has
the
record
so
clearly
indicates
and
as
mississippi
concedes,
these
peaceful
demonstrators,
negro
and
white
citizens
calling
for
the
vindication
of
their
most
fundamental
constitutional
federal
rights
are
walking
in
the
very
spot
in
which
law
enforcement
officers
for
two
months
have
told
them
it
was
proper
to
walk
that
under
those
conditions
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
when
county
officials
have
for
two
months
blocked
of
a
certain
--
if
you
would
look
at
the
diagram
which
judge
rives
of
course
has
attached
to
his
dissenting
opinion
which
is
in
the
record,
a
diagram
of
the
forrest
county
courthouse,
if
for
two
months
county
officials
have
said
that
this
is
the
area
in
which
if
you
walk
here
it
does
not
obstruct
the
main
entrance
to
the
courthouse
that
yes,
under
cox
and
every
other
opinion
of
this
court,
it
would
be
as
this
court
has
said
indefensible
entrapment
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
after
that
pattern
of
time,
it's
permissible
to
enforce
a
criminal
sanction
against
people
peacefully
expressing
their
views.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh
no,
he
can't
make
it
a
law.
that
law
was
made
when
the
bill
of
rights,
your
honor,
was
adopted.
the
law
which
sanctioned
the
demonstrations
was
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
law
that
says
that
people
have
the
right
to
peacefully
assemble,
express
themselves,
and
petition
their
government
for
regress
of
grievances.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
but
it
does
say
that
the
state
may
not
say
some
people
can
do
it
and
other
people
may
not.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
--
and
that's
the
issue,
mr.
justice
black.
this
case
presents
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
two
months,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
and
we're
all
precisely
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
precisely
our
point
because
the
enactment
of
the
law
was
designed
as
the
court
said
in
brown
against
louisiana
was
designed
and
had
the
actual
effect
of
stopping
and
cutting
off
otherwise
peaceful
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
making
it
illegal
to
engage
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
ah!
but
what
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
which
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
which
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
stewart,
makes
this
situation
doubly
serious
because
it's
extremely
interesting.
judge
coleman
in
his
findings
of
fact
said
that
up
until
april
10th
when
the
first
arrest
took
place,
the
picketing
was
peaceful
and
protected
activities.
on
examination,
mr.
dukes
said
that
if
the
law
had
been
in
effect
prior
to
april
10,
the
demonstrators
would
have
been
guilty
of
violating
the
law.
in
other
words,
the
law
itself
was
designed
to
cut
off
peaceful,
protected
activities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
but
what
the
transcript
below
shows,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
what
this
court
pointed
out
in
button
was
so
important
in
considering
the
operation
of
a
statute,
its
setting
and
the
way
it
operated.
let
me
make
this
suggestion,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
rather
amazing
that
the
majority
below
and
the
appellees
do
not
discuss
the
arrests
which
took
place
on
the
afternoon
of
april
10
and
the
morning
of
april
11
and
the
morning
of
may
18.
they
simply
do
not
discuss
them.
why?
because
these
arrests
were
of
seven
people,
seven
people
with
not
a
single
bit
of
evidence
in
the
record.
they
didn't
even
attempt
to
show
obstruction
of
anything
whatsoever.
and
as
judge
rives
points
out
below,
he
uses
the
word
“fantastic”.
he
says
it's
incredibly
fantastic
to
believe
that
the
arrests
of
seven
people
carrying
signs
saying
“mississippians
are
americans,
too”
and
“we
demand
the
right
to
vote”
could
conceivably
be
the
violation
of
any
state
law.
now,
we
suggest
that
this
is
highly
significant
because
this
shows
the
way
in
which
the
mississippi
authorities
utilized
the
statute,
assuming
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
we
do
not
because
the
court
is
aware
of
our
position
of
challenging
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
both
originally
and
as
amended,
particularly
as
amended.
but
assuming
a
valid
statute
here,
under
the
second
branch
of
dombrowkski,
i
would
suggest
that
nothing
is
clearer
as
judge
rives
points
out
a
pattern
of
utilization
of
a
conceivably
valid
state
statute
to
harass
the
exercise
of
civil
rights
and
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
probably
ten
statutes
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
they
are
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
they're
also
cited
in
the
court's
opinion
in
peacock.
there
are
a
whole
host
of
statutes
which
were
available
to
the
mississippi
authorities,
which
if
these
individuals
were
really
blocking
the
ingress
to
that
courthouse
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
could
have
been
invoked
by
the
mississippi
authorities.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
think
yours,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
charges
which
the
peacock
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
plaintiffs
who
are
being
removed
on,
yes.
you
cited
them
sir,
i
believe,
in
your
opinion.
now,
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
the
record
shows
in
light
now
that
mississippi
has
in
fact
interpreted
the
statute
as
if
it
had
an
overbroad
sweep
bringing
into
its
orbit
protected
first
amendment
and
civil
rights
activities,
that
the
full
criteria
of
dombrowski
under
both
the
first
branch
and
the
second
branch
are
met.
the
only
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
in
conclusion
is
that
what
is
most
serious
here
is
the
final
suggestion
of
the
majority
below
that
federal
relief
should
be
denied
because
picketing
in
mississippi
to
obtain
a
vote
and
to
encourage
others
to
do
so
is
a
thing
of
the
past.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
the
coroner
commission
report
pointed
out
just
two
days
ago,
country
stands
at
a
crossroads,
that
at
this
moment
in
mississippi
and
throughout
the
nation,
a
strengthening
of
federal
power
to
protect
the
peaceful
utilization
of
first
amendment
liberties
in
the
solution
of
fundamental
problems
which
rift
this
nation
is
the
highest
duty
and
obligation
of
this
court.
that
to
deny
relief
today
in
this
case
would
be
to
advocate
the
higher
responsibility
of
the
federal
national
judiciary.
thank
you,
your
honor.
