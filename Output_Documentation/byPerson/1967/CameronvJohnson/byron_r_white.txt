well,
you
better
be
--
if
you
better
be
there,
you
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
suggest
that
perhaps
the
declaratory
judgment
in
these
circumstances
might
be
of
great
service
to
you?
justice
byron

cuder
indicates
that
perhaps
the
federal
court
in
any
event
ought
to
proceed
to
give
it
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
jeannette,
this
court
refused
to
authorize
an
injunction
even
though
the
statute
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
that
very
day.
now,
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
district
court
brought
by
you.
there's
a
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
at
that
point,
would
there
be
any
reason
for
entering
an
injunction
against
the
state
court?
