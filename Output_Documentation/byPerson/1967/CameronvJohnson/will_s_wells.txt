mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
please
pardon
me
but
i've
got
--
i'm
just
getting
over
a
pretty
bad
cold
and
i've
got
a
little
laryngitis.
i'll
try
not
to
let
it
interfere
too
much.
i
regret
that
mr.
smith
yesterday
in
all
most
of
the
beginning
of
his
argument
saw
fit
to
go
outside
the
record
and
take
a
verbal
salvo
at
the
south
and
mississippi
particularly.
he
said
to
this
court
conditions
are
still
bad
in
the
south
and
particularly
in
mississippi
and
we
need
every
vehicle
to
protect
people's
federal
rights.
he
added
just
last
night
that
there
was
a
shooting
in
mississippi
at
mr.
charles'
evidence.
that
statement,
if
the
court
please,
was
unwarranted
and
untrue.
i
would
be
less
than
frank
and
honest
with
this
court
if
i
did
not
say,
and
i'm
not
at
all
proud
of
it
that
in
the
past,
mississippi
has
been
grossly
discriminate
or
discriminatory
particularly
in
the
field
of
registering
and
voting
rights
for
negroes,
and
i
say
i'm
not
proud
of
it.
but
i
can
say
to
this
court
that
within
the
past
or
for
the
past
two
years
at
least,
we've
done
a
lot
to
get
our
house
in
order
and
we
need
and
i
think
now
deserve
all
the
help
we
can
get.
i've
been
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
mississippi
since
june
of
'62
and
for
the
last
three
years,
i've
been
more
or
less
the
liaison
between
the
attorney
general's
office,
the
governor's
office,
and
the
department
of
justice.
since
the
fall
of
1965,
there
has
been
no
problem
whatsoever
in
negroes
registering
and
voting
in
mississippi,
none
whatsoever.
over
200,000
of
them
are
registered
there
to
date.
in
last
summer's
general
primary
--
i
mean
primary
and
general
elections,
more
than
75
negroes
were
candidates
for
public
office.
between
25
and
30
of
them
were
elected,
elected
to
members
of
board
to
supervisors,
justices
of
the
peace,
constable,
clerks
to
the
chancery
court,
members
of
school
boards,
one
elected
to
the
legislature.
just
last
month
in
a
special
election
to
fill
the
unexpired
term
of
governor
williams
as
congressman,
there
were
certain
candidates.
candidates
in
the
race,
one
was
charles
edwards,
a
negro.
he
led
the
ticket
and
he's
in
the
runoff
in
the
second
primary
for
the
next
tuesday.
i
know
what
the
situation
is
there
with
reference
to
voting
and
registering,
and
there
is
no
problem.
in
all
of
the
elections
last
summer,
and
i
worked
--
i
have
pushed
all
knowledge
of
this.
i
worked
with
the
justice
department.
those
elections
were
observed
by
federal
observers,
members
of
the
justice
department
and
there
was
no
criticism
of
any
of
them,
no
charges
of
unfairness
in
any
of
them.
so
i
say
we've
gone
a
long
ways
to
get
our
house
in
order
and
we
need
all
the
help
and
encouragement
we
can
get.
now,
to
put
this
case
in
perspective,
if
the
court
would
please,
and
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
kinoy
sought
to
confuse
everybody
but
he
certainly
did
me
about
some
of
the
issues
in
this
matter.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
concession
by
the
state
of
mississippi
whatsoever
that
can
be
found
anywhere
of
selective
enforcement
of
the
statute.
here's
what
counsel
is
overlooking.
parades
on
the
public
streets
of
hattiesburg
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor
and
commissioners
and
police
department
of
the
city
of
hattiesburg.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
no
control
over
those
public
streets.
they
are
streets
that
belong
to
the
city,
maintained
and
paved
by
the
city.
the
sheriff
has
no
supervision
over
who
can
use
them
and
who
can't.
the
city
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
enforcement
of
this
statute.
this
statute
has
to
do
with
protecting
publicly
owned
buildings
such
as
in
this
instance,
courthouses,
which
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
state
authorities
or
county
authorities.
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
there's
no
parade
ordinance
in
hattiesburg
that
i
know
of
at
all,
but
the
court
has
--
the
sheriff
would
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
it.
they
go
to
parade
there
in
the
public
streets,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
they
are
not
on
the
courthouse
grounds.
they
are
not
on
the
sidewalks
adjoining
the
courthouse.
they
are
on
a
public
street
that
just
happens
to
run
in
front
of
the
courthouse.
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
they
make
some
arrangement
with
the
city
for
the
purpose
of
the
police
helping
direct
traffic
and
so
forth
and
let
them
know
it,
and
i
know
of
no
problem
in
the
parades.
they
have
school
band
parades
for
the
schools
and
if
these
people
want
to
parade,
they
could
parade.
but
they
go
to
the
city.
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes!
there
would
be
absolutely
no
problem
with
that
as
far
as
the
city
is
concerned.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
not
in
the
record
if
the
court
please.
that
didn't
come
up
because
it's
not
a
part
of
it
but
i
happen
to
know
that
is
the
situation.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
and
whether
it
was
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
was
not
objecting
to
--
i
was
going
over
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
is
not
in
the
record.
i
was
--
i
was
responding
when
you
asked
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
let's
go
back
if
the
court
please
and
get
the
history
of
this
lawsuit
and
put
it
in
perspective.
several
days
prior
to
january
22nd,
and
this
is
all
in
record,
22nd
1964,
leaflets
were
distributed
all
throughout
hattiesburg
by
the
cofo
organization,
council
of
federate
organizations
which
was
then
at
that
time,
calling
on
negroes
and
sympathizers
to
meet
at
the
courthouse
on
the
22nd
and
called
it
freedom
day,
recommending
that
the
parents
take
their
children
out
of
school
and
come
to
the
courthouse
and
about
200
of
them
assembled
and
they
marched
all
up
and
around
the
courthouse.
they
were
not
bothered,
they
were
not
molested.
the
authorities
did
what
they
did
to
keep
down
any
instance
and
were
able
to
do
it.
and
then
from
january
22nd
on
until
april
10th,
practically
every
weekday,
there
was
picketing
sometimes
in
small
groups,
sometimes
in
larger
around
the
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
after
this
statute
was
passed?
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
on
the
day
of
the
arrest,
there's
evidence
here
of
an
attempt
of
the
demonstration
agent
to
come
out
of
the
hall.
she
had
to
come
out
to
use
that
and
she
couldn't.
she
had
to
actually
fall
in
to
the
picket
line
and
march
with
the
picket
line
all
to
get
out
--
get
around
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
would
please,
we
get
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
the
only
evidence
of
any
particular
person,
yes
sir.
but
we
did
not
take
the
position
in
the
trial
of
this
case
that
we
were
obligated
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
proving
that
these
people
were
guilty
or
innocent
trying
out
the
facts
of
whether
or
not
they
were
guilty
of
a
violation
of
a
statute.
that's
a
matter
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
as
each
one
of
them
i
don't
know.
they
would
have
to
be
judged
from
separate
affidavits,
be
proven
beyond
--
guilty
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
they're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
we
did
not
take
it
that
that
court
of
equity
was
there
to
try
the
facts
as
to
whether
each
individual
was
guilty
or
not
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
this
was
a
good
faith
prosecution
and
not
something
to
harass.
now,
coming
on
back
to
the
parade
or
to
the
demonstration,
as
mr.
dukes
testified,
this
was
on
tax
collecting
time
and
this
was
being
done
in
such
a
way
that
people
just
couldn't
even
get
in
to
the
front
of
the
courthouse
to
pay
the
taxes,
so
the
city
and
the
county
guard
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
was
mr.
dukes'
testimony
that
that
was
a
situation
at
the
beginning
back
in
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
you
said
that
they
were
blocking
the
front
entrances
of
this
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
in
this
opinion.
mr.
will
s.
wells
as
to
the
matter,
if
the
court
please,
i
suggest
that
you
will
find
on
page
245
and
246
of
the
appendix
and
mr.
dukes,
the
county
attorney's
testimony
on
246.
i
asked
him
this
question,
“well,
after
these
big
marches
and
his
great
group,
was
there
any
effort
made
to
set
up
some
barricades
and
outline
a
place
where
they
could
picket?”
“it
was
absolutely
necessary,
mr.
wells
because
the
manner
in
which
they
are
raising
to
picket
completely
blocked
the
front
entrance
of
the
courthouse.
and
being
in
january
and
the
tax
paying
time,
we
had
to
make
some
arrangements
for
our
people
to
get
to
the
courthouse
or
barricades
were
set
up
on
north
and
south
of
the
main
street
and
so
forth,
and
asked
them
to
picket
there.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
then
after
the
barricades
were
set
up
and
they
were
asked
to
picket
in
this
one
area,
mr.
justice
fortas,
there
is
no
testimony
other
than
some
testimony
stating
that
during
that
time,
mr.
dukes
testified
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
question
asked
mr.
dukes
by
judge
rives,
i
believe,
just
a
minute
please.
on
page
267
of
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
rives
says,
“mr.
dukes,
may
i
ask
you,
did
any
persons
complain
to
you
as
a
prosecuting
officer,
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
county
that
they
had
undertaken
to
gain
access
to
the
courthouse
and
access
have
been
brought
by
the
witness?”
“judge
rives,
we
had
complaints
since
january
21st
constantly.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
this
is
in
the
appendix.
page
267,
it
is
part
of
the
--
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
full
three-judge
court.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
right.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
was
the
extent
right
on
--
up
until.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
at
those
small
numbers,
not
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
and
we
knew.
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
right.
now,
if
the
court
would
please,
following
that.
mr.
will
s.
wells
now
following
this
in
april
when
this
statute
was
passed,
and
it
wasn't
passed
just
for
hattiesburg.
we
had
the
situation
in
various
parts
of
the
state.
when
this
statute
was
passed,
it
became
the
law.
on
the
9th
of
april,
the
county
attorney,
the
district
attorney,
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
came
out
about
four
o'clock
and
the
sheriff
asked
these
people
to
stop
--
i
want
to
read
you
something,
is
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
passed
this
statute
and
i
want
you
to
hear
it
read.
and
they
read
the
statute
to
them
in
detail
and
he
said,
“now,
i
do
not
want
to
have
to
arrest
you
people
but
you
cannot
picket
in
such
ways
as
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
the
entrances
and
exits
of
this
courthouse.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
at
that
time,
the
record
is
not
clear
but
there
were
some
15
or
20,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
will
s.
wells
on
that
occasion?
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
he
wanted
to
advice
them
that
as
he
explained
to
them,
the
way
at
times
you
have
been
doing
it,
you
have
been
blocking
these
entrances
and
i
want
you
to
know
it
and
ask
you
to
--
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
picket
but
do
it
in
such
a
way
and
space
yourself
in
such
a
way
as
you
won't
do
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
he
told
them.
mr.
will
s.
wells
now
that
night,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
night
they
had
a
meeting.
they
discussed
the
statute
with
a
lawyer.
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
they
prepared
the
written
statement
for
the
press
and
the
next
morning,
they
came
not
in
these
numbers
but
some
40
of
them
came.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
this
one
later
that
tried
to
get
out
and
then
the
sheriff
and
the
county
attorney
himself
went
out
and
tried
to
see
if
they
could
move
against
it
and
the
pictures
themselves,
if
the
court
please,
in
here
show
it
became
--
it
could
be
a
picket
line
and
became
a
picket
fence
and
it
shows
right
at
their
entrances
that
they
were
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
testimony
from
mrs.
--
testimony
of
mrs.
bricket
beginning
on
page
268
of
the
appendix.
now,
on
the
bottom
of
page
269,
“now,
mrs.
bricket,
in
connection
with
the
duties
of
your
since
she
was
home
demonstration
aid,
do
you
frequently
have
occasion
to
go
to
the
can
agent
so?”
“yes,
sir.”
“generally
by
how?”
“sometimes
four,
five
times
a
day.
it
varies
from
day
to
day.”
and
she
goes
on
and
explains
her
situation
and
the
condition
that
existed
there,
that
day.
she
testified
that
there
were
some
35
or
40
who
were
walking
there
very
close
together.
“did
you
have
on
occasion,
during
the
time
that
that
line
was
being
picketed,
to
go
to
the
courthouse?”
“yes,
sir.
to
pick
up
some
materials.”
“would
you
tell
the
court
just
what
happened
and
how
you
got
there?”
“i
started
the
regular
route
and
they
were
so
close
together
that
i
had
to
wait
for
just
a
moment
to
get
in
line
and
i
fell
in
line
with
them
and
started
weaving
back
and
forth
until
i
reached
until
the
front
steps
and
then
dropped
out
of
the
line
and
got
in
the
courthouse.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
from
beginning
of
--
start
all
the
way
around
--
if
the
court
would
please,
they
would
walk

as
this
picture
shows,
part
of
this
walkway
was
in
the
courthouse
ground.

law
clerk's
wife
decided
to
go
back
to
montgomery
by
way
of
hattiesburg,
and
he
went
by
and
made
an
inspection
of
the
situation
as
existed
then,
which
was
some
good
long
private
practice
the
same.
and
i
understand
he's
--
and
this
--
i
got
this
information
alone.
i
got
from
him,
so
he's
not
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
--
i
think
how
this
got
into
the
record.
this
was
prepared
by
judge
rives
himself
personally
on
his
law
clerk
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
alright
sir,
the
line
of
march,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
the
lower
part
of
this
drawing
and
to
the
left
is
the
sidewalk
on
the
public
street
coming
on
around
to
eaton
street.
then,
you'll
notice
this
little
--
as
he's
got
it
.31
walk
at
least
from
the
street
running
north,
runs
on
up
by
here.
it
curves
a
little
bit
to
the
left,
the
line
march,
it
comes
back
out,
and
that's
the
circle
they
were
making.
mr.
will
s.
wells
3.8?
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
the
width
of
the
walk.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mrs.
bricket's
office
--
the
courthouse
is
here
to
the
right
of
this
drawing.
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
other
words,
this
is
a
courthouse
steps
right
here,
in
front
of
them.
and
this
is
the
courthouse
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
she
was
leaving
--
her
office
is
where
this
entrance
to
home
demonstration
office
here
you
see
there,
that's
her
office.
mr.
will
s.
wells
she
comes
out
of
there
and
comes
around
to
her
right
as
she
comes
out
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
and
then
comes
out
into
this
area
and
follows
this
line
in
here
to
go
up
into
the
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
picket
line
was
right
across
here.
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
she
had
to
come
in,
couldn't
get
through.
she
had
to
step
in
the
line
and
weave
her
way
until
she
could
get
out.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
just
about.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
harlan,
here's
where
--
what
i
see
the
issue
to
be
in
this
case,
is
our
position
that
this
statute
is
about
as
narrowly
drawn
as
it
could
be.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
both
of
them
or
the
last
one
and
the
way
this
came
about
as
there
is
one
that
statute
was
first
passed,
the
word
“unreasonable”
was
not
in
there
preceding
the
word
“interfere”.
it
was
to
obstruct
or
interfere.
to
be
quite
frank,
it
was
my
thinking
that
even
at
court
where
you
talk
about
interfering,
any
little
thing
can
be
interfering
and
i
felt
and
i
still
feel
and
it
was
at
my
suggestion
that
the
legislature
amended
that
statute
and
to
put
the
word
“unreasonable”
before
interfere
because
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
any
court
would
interpret
it
to
be
an
unreasonable
interference
rather
than
just
some
little
interference.
i
think
unreasonable
interference
narrows
it
rather
than
broadens
it
and
it
was
actually
at
my
suggestion
to
legislature
did
that.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
just
exactly
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
the
factual
issue
as
to
whether
anyone
of
them
did,
i
don't
think
it's
for
court
of
equity
to
determine.
i
think
that
the
question
--
the
view
to
determine
here
is
this,
is
this
a
good
faith,
honest
good
faith
prosecution
that's
not
just
done
to
harass
somebody?
can
they
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
courts
of
mississippi?
mr.
will
s.
wells
but
these
pictures
were
put
in
there
for
this
purpose,
to
show
that
at
least
they
have
probable
cause
here
to
justify
some
judge.
now
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
exactly
my
position,
if
the
court
would
please.
that's
exactly
the
position
i
took
with
the
lower
court
and
as
judge
coleman
said,
we
are
not
trying
to
try
these
people
as
to
whether
they
are
guilty
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
alleged
offense
was
committed,
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
april
10,
1964.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
this
cases
could
be
tried
in
--
that
in
the
county
court,
they
could
be
tried
in
short
order.
i
mean
that
i
do
not
grant
at
all.
they
then
could
be
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
on
the
record,
that's
made
there
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
and
then
here.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i'll
say
probably
60
days.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
court
is
up
with
its
docket
for
the
full,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
four
months
outside.
mr.
will
s.
wells
from
the
circuit
court
to
supreme
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
have
actually
raised
it
in
this
case,
in
its
inception
before
they
were
removed.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
mr.
will
s.
wells
and
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
and
may
i
say
even
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
even
if
you
would
determine
whether
you
had
the
right
to
do
it,
it's
the
question
of
whether
they're
entitled
any
relief
in
the
criteria
of
dombrowski
in
this
case.
the
theory
on
which
they
ask
for
these
injunctions
to
start
with
was
this,
and
they
admitted
though
for
us
that
the
purpose
of
these
demonstrations
was
voting
registration.
and
in
their
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
all
the
way
through,
that
unless
they
were
enjoined,
there
would
discourage
negroes
from
registering
to
vote
and
correct
they're
moot.
the
facts
in
this
record
show
that
after
the
last
arrests
were
made,
the
ones
that
they
say
that
if
you
stop
us
from
doing
this
it's
going
to
cut
down
the
registration,
the
record
shows
that
from
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
when
there's
picketing
as
much
as
was
seized
that
more
negroes
registered
after
that
until
the
time
of
this
trial
than
had
registered
prior
to
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
this
--
there
was
one
witness
who
testified
in
connection
with
suit
against
mr.
lien,
yes
sir,
the
registrar.
mr.
will
s.
wells
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
has
put
in
strong
that
it
did
not
hurt.
mr.
will
s.
wells
after
these
arrests
on
april
10th
and
11th,
they
continued
to
picket
there
in
smaller
numbers
not
blocking
the
entrance
for
38
days.
mr.
will
s.
wells
and
there
was
no
arrest.
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
just
a
minute,
i'll
come
to
that
if
i
may.
here's
what
happened.
on
the
10th
that
morning,
these
38
or
40
people
were
arrested.
that
afternoon,
there
were
nine
more
arrested.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
were
there
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
just
a
minute
now,
please
sir.
as
soon
as
the
county
attorney
found
out
about
the
nine
arrests
that
afternoon,
all
but
one
were
juveniles.
they
were
immediately
released
to
their
parents
and
no
charges
were
made
against
them
and
have
made
on
against
them.
and
the
one
made
against
the
one
grown
person
that
was
there
leading
them,
if
it
ever
gets
back
to
state
court,
it's
going
to
be
dismissed,
so
they
don't
have
a
problem
with
adjoining
those.
mr.
will
s.
wells
because
she
would
be
there
alone,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
with
these
children.
these
arrests
were
made
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
after
checking
into
it
by
the
county
attorney,
he
felt
these
were
juveniles
in
the
first
place
and
he
felt
that
it
would
not
warrant
to
go
ahead
and
charge
them
with
it.
they
were
released
to
their
parents
and
kept
in
a
short
time.
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice,
sometimes
an
officer
can
make
a
mistake
in
arresting
somebody.
when
somebody
finds
out,
they'll
say,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
prosecute.”
those
things
can
happen,
not
necessarily
in
these
areas
but
in
other
areas,
and
he
felt
it
was
not
enough
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
prosecution.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
were
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
they
were
--
14,
15,
16,
and
17
years
old.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
we
feel
we
take
this
position,
if
your
honor
would
please,
this
statute
is
certainly
as
narrowly
drawn
as
i
think
it
could
be
and
we
feel
that
the
state
has
certainly
got
a
right
to
go
no
further
than
they
have.
mr.
will
s.
wells
ex
parte
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
black,
i
have
read
the
case
but
i
frankly
am
not
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
will
s.
wells
but
proof
that
this
thing
shows,
if
your
honor
would
please,
the
very
thing
happened
from
april
11th
until
may
18th,
they
continued
to
picket
in
the
same
area
but
in
small
enough
numbers
not
to
block
anything
and
they
were
not
molested.
on
the
18th
of
may
or
the
28th
of
may
--
back
in
may,
another
large
group
came
and
there
were
some
arrests
made
there
when
they
came
in
large
numbers
again
and
it
blocked.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
he's
talking
about
that
afternoon
on
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
the
seven
that
he
was
talking
about,
they
actually
were
nine
and
not
seven,
the
ones
i
was
talking
about
by
the
juveniles.
in
may
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
--
in
may
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
may,
there
has
--
there
were
some
15
or
20
arrested
in
may
as
i
recall.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think
mr.
dukes
has
testified.
he
was
asked
about
it.
he
said
he
did
not
remember
how
many
but
there
was
a
large
group.
mr.
dukes
has
accounted
to
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
that
i
do
not
know
if
the
record
is
saying
on
that.
they
were
--
that's
what
they
were
charged
with
having
done
in
that
large
group
on
that
day.
we
feel,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
statute
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
2283
is
a
law,
we
feel
first
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
feel
that
there's
no
showing
here
that
it's
being
constitutionally
applied
to
these
people.
the
--
the
argument
about
the
selective
enforcement
is
covered
in
judge
coleman's
opinion
in
dealing
with
parades
in
the
city
and
the
public
street
on
the
one
hand,
that
it
had
nothing
to
with
the
sidewalks
adjoining
the
courthouse
and
walkways
going
in
to
the
courthouse.
they're
not
synonymous
at
all
because
the
statute
doesn't
come
into
place.
even
judge
rives
at
some
of
his
questions,
he
said
the
court
would
be
interested
in
what
he
would
--
what
he
asked
--
judge
rives
asked
mr.
dukes
on
--
on
page
265
of
the
appendix.
and
mr.
dukes,
he
was
the
prosecuting
attorney.
judge
rives,
when
there
was
a
colloquy
between
mr.
smith
and
me
about
the
difference
between
parades
and
the
kind
he
was
talking
about
in
demonstrations.
this
kind
judge
rives
thinks,
said,
“i
think
we'd
get
into
an
argument
on
the
law.”
“i
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
however
can
a
plaintiff
be
granted
to
parade
in
such
a
manner
in
your
opinion
as
to
block
the
entrance
to
the
courthouse?”
by
the
witness,
“no,
sir;
i
do
not
think
so.”
judge
rives,
“in
other
words,
could
the
city
ground
appointment
to
violate
that
statute?”
the
witness,
“did
the
city
grant
appointment
to
march
around
the
courtyard
to
violate
statute?
no,
sir;
i
don't
think
so,”
judge
rives,
“permits
and
the
statute
are
two
separate
things?”
“yes.”
it's
definitely
my
opinion
that
the
city
certainly
could
bring
in
information
to
violate
the
state
statute.
then
judge
coleman,
“let
me
ask
you
this,
the
parading
that
you've
been
talking
about,
was
that
in
the
streets
or
was
that
on
the
courthouse
grounds
and
adjacent
to
the
entrances
to
the
courthouse?”
“it
was
in
the
streets,
your
honor.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute
is
not
against
somebody
who
gets
together
with
the
intention
or
with
a
conspiracy
or
with
a
purpose.
it
posed
to
set
down
to
this,
that
you
actually
do
it.
that
you
actually
do
it,
that's
why
this
is
prohibited.
there's
no
prohibition
against
picketing.
there's
not
prohibition
against
anything
else.
you
just
says
this,
you
can't
do
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
obstruct
or
unreasonably
interfere
with
ingress
and
egress
to
the
entrance
of
this
building.
that's
all
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
for
a
group
of
people
to
parade
down
the
public
street
of
hattiesburg
and
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse
is
a
matter
to
be
controlled
by
the
city
of
hattiesburg.
now,
that's
a
different
situation
from
--
that
would
keep
you
from
going
across
the
street,
to
get
across
that
street
over
here.
that's
all
for
a
short
length
of
time,
just
to
parade
there
should
not
keep
them
and
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
one
way
or
the
other.
but
this
statute
says
this,
you
can't
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
only
question
is
that
the
record
said
this,
does
that
parade
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse?
yes.
could
people
get
from
across
over
the
beacon
street
while
the
parade
is
passing
by?
he
said,
no.
for
a
minute,
they
could.
just
five
minutes
the
parade
goes
by
and
they
can
come
across
the
street.
but
that's
not
the
--
that's
not
all
on
the
courthouse.
this
courthouse
sits
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
the
square.
streets
come
in
and
out
of
its
way
from
this
one.
i
think
he's
been
the
streets
in
hattiesburg
with
stalls
and
so
forth
on
it
outside
and
the
only
thing
this
thing
would
prohibit
there
is
this,
don't
demonstrate
in
such
ways
as
to
block
or
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
these
entrances.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think
the
sheriff
would
have
the
right
to
go
out
there,
yes
sir,
and
enforce
the
statute
on
them.
they
would
have
the
right.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
they
insisted
on
staying
right
there
and
would
prevent
them
from
getting
there,
i
think
he
would
have
that
right
to
charge
them,
yes.
this
is,
as
mr.
justice
black
said,
just
stop
there.
mr.
will
s.
wells
there
had
to
be
some
rule
of
reason.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
don't
think
he
would.
no,
sir.
and
i
think
if
a
civil
rights
group
stopped
there,
he
would
not
arrest
them
either
at
the
streets.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
marshall,
situations
have
changed
dramatically
in
mississippi,
sir,
since
you
were
last
there,
i
am
happy
to
say.
mr.
will
s.
wells
well,
they
changed
then
--
they
had
changed
even
then,
if
you
were
there
a
month
or
so
ago
since
you
were
a
long
time
ago
sir,
considerably
so.
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
have
done
what
i
can
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
to
help
change
--
i've
done
my
best
to
have
--
even
judge
rives
complimented
me
when
i
before
the
fifth
circuit
recently
but
in
fact,
he
said
you
all
had
done
a
good
job
in
mississippi
a
whole
lot
better
than
we
are
in
alabama
and
i
think
some
of
the
--
some
of
it
--
you
were
entitled
to
create
some
of
it.
mr.
wells
and
i
rather
appreciate
it
even
though
he
wrote
the
dissent
in
this
case.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
please
pardon
me
but
i've
got
--
i'm
just
getting
over
a
pretty
bad
cold
and
i've
got
a
little
laryngitis.
i'll
try
not
to
let
it
interfere
too
much.
i
regret
that
mr.
smith
yesterday
in
all
most
of
the
beginning
of
his
argument
saw
fit
to
go
outside
the
record
and
take
a
verbal
salvo
at
the
south
and
mississippi
particularly.
he
said
to
this
court
conditions
are
still
bad
in
the
south
and
particularly
in
mississippi
and
we
need
every
vehicle
to
protect
people's
federal
rights.
he
added
just
last
night
that
there
was
a
shooting
in
mississippi
at
mr.
charles'
evidence.
that
statement,
if
the
court
please,
was
unwarranted
and
untrue.
i
would
be
less
than
frank
and
honest
with
this
court
if
i
did
not
say,
and
i'm
not
at
all
proud
of
it
that
in
the
past,
mississippi
has
been
grossly
discriminate
or
discriminatory
particularly
in
the
field
of
registering
and
voting
rights
for
negroes,
and
i
say
i'm
not
proud
of
it.
but
i
can
say
to
this
court
that
within
the
past
or
for
the
past
two
years
at
least,
we've
done
a
lot
to
get
our
house
in
order
and
we
need
and
i
think
now
deserve
all
the
help
we
can
get.
i've
been
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
mississippi
since
june
of
'62
and
for
the
last
three
years,
i've
been
more
or
less
the
liaison
between
the
attorney
general's
office,
the
governor's
office,
and
the
department
of
justice.
since
the
fall
of
1965,
there
has
been
no
problem
whatsoever
in
negroes
registering
and
voting
in
mississippi,
none
whatsoever.
over
200,000
of
them
are
registered
there
to
date.
in
last
summer's
general
primary
--
i
mean
primary
and
general
elections,
more
than
75
negroes
were
candidates
for
public
office.
between
25
and
30
of
them
were
elected,
elected
to
members
of
board
to
supervisors,
justices
of
the
peace,
constable,
clerks
to
the
chancery
court,
members
of
school
boards,
one
elected
to
the
legislature.
just
last
month
in
a
special
election
to
fill
the
unexpired
term
of
governor
williams
as
congressman,
there
were
certain
candidates.
candidates
in
the
race,
one
was
charles
edwards,
a
negro.
he
led
the
ticket
and
he's
in
the
runoff
in
the
second
primary
for
the
next
tuesday.
i
know
what
the
situation
is
there
with
reference
to
voting
and
registering,
and
there
is
no
problem.
in
all
of
the
elections
last
summer,
and
i
worked
--
i
have
pushed
all
knowledge
of
this.
i
worked
with
the
justice
department.
those
elections
were
observed
by
federal
observers,
members
of
the
justice
department
and
there
was
no
criticism
of
any
of
them,
no
charges
of
unfairness
in
any
of
them.
so
i
say
we've
gone
a
long
ways
to
get
our
house
in
order
and
we
need
all
the
help
and
encouragement
we
can
get.
now,
to
put
this
case
in
perspective,
if
the
court
would
please,
and
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
kinoy
sought
to
confuse
everybody
but
he
certainly
did
me
about
some
of
the
issues
in
this
matter.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
concession
by
the
state
of
mississippi
whatsoever
that
can
be
found
anywhere
of
selective
enforcement
of
the
statute.
here's
what
counsel
is
overlooking.
parades
on
the
public
streets
of
hattiesburg
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor
and
commissioners
and
police
department
of
the
city
of
hattiesburg.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
no
control
over
those
public
streets.
they
are
streets
that
belong
to
the
city,
maintained
and
paved
by
the
city.
the
sheriff
has
no
supervision
over
who
can
use
them
and
who
can't.
the
city
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
enforcement
of
this
statute.
this
statute
has
to
do
with
protecting
publicly
owned
buildings
such
as
in
this
instance,
courthouses,
which
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
state
authorities
or
county
authorities.
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
there's
no
parade
ordinance
in
hattiesburg
that
i
know
of
at
all,
but
the
court
has
--
the
sheriff
would
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
it.
they
go
to
parade
there
in
the
public
streets,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
they
are
not
on
the
courthouse
grounds.
they
are
not
on
the
sidewalks
adjoining
the
courthouse.
they
are
on
a
public
street
that
just
happens
to
run
in
front
of
the
courthouse.
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
they
make
some
arrangement
with
the
city
for
the
purpose
of
the
police
helping
direct
traffic
and
so
forth
and
let
them
know
it,
and
i
know
of
no
problem
in
the
parades.
they
have
school
band
parades
for
the
schools
and
if
these
people
want
to
parade,
they
could
parade.
but
they
go
to
the
city.
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes!
there
would
be
absolutely
no
problem
with
that
as
far
as
the
city
is
concerned.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
not
in
the
record
if
the
court
please.
that
didn't
come
up
because
it's
not
a
part
of
it
but
i
happen
to
know
that
is
the
situation.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
and
whether
it
was
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
was
not
objecting
to
--
i
was
going
over
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
is
not
in
the
record.
i
was
--
i
was
responding
when
you
asked
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
let's
go
back
if
the
court
please
and
get
the
history
of
this
lawsuit
and
put
it
in
perspective.
several
days
prior
to
january
22nd,
and
this
is
all
in
record,
22nd
1964,
leaflets
were
distributed
all
throughout
hattiesburg
by
the
cofo
organization,
council
of
federate
organizations
which
was
then
at
that
time,
calling
on
negroes
and
sympathizers
to
meet
at
the
courthouse
on
the
22nd
and
called
it
freedom
day,
recommending
that
the
parents
take
their
children
out
of
school
and
come
to
the
courthouse
and
about
200
of
them
assembled
and
they
marched
all
up
and
around
the
courthouse.
they
were
not
bothered,
they
were
not
molested.
the
authorities
did
what
they
did
to
keep
down
any
instance
and
were
able
to
do
it.
and
then
from
january
22nd
on
until
april
10th,
practically
every
weekday,
there
was
picketing
sometimes
in
small
groups,
sometimes
in
larger
around
the
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
after
this
statute
was
passed?
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
on
the
day
of
the
arrest,
there's
evidence
here
of
an
attempt
of
the
demonstration
agent
to
come
out
of
the
hall.
she
had
to
come
out
to
use
that
and
she
couldn't.
she
had
to
actually
fall
in
to
the
picket
line
and
march
with
the
picket
line
all
to
get
out
--
get
around
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
would
please,
we
get
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
the
only
evidence
of
any
particular
person,
yes
sir.
but
we
did
not
take
the
position
in
the
trial
of
this
case
that
we
were
obligated
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
proving
that
these
people
were
guilty
or
innocent
trying
out
the
facts
of
whether
or
not
they
were
guilty
of
a
violation
of
a
statute.
that's
a
matter
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
as
each
one
of
them
i
don't
know.
they
would
have
to
be
judged
from
separate
affidavits,
be
proven
beyond
--
guilty
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
they're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
we
did
not
take
it
that
that
court
of
equity
was
there
to
try
the
facts
as
to
whether
each
individual
was
guilty
or
not
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
this
was
a
good
faith
prosecution
and
not
something
to
harass.
now,
coming
on
back
to
the
parade
or
to
the
demonstration,
as
mr.
dukes
testified,
this
was
on
tax
collecting
time
and
this
was
being
done
in
such
a
way
that
people
just
couldn't
even
get
in
to
the
front
of
the
courthouse
to
pay
the
taxes,
so
the
city
and
the
county
guard
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
was
mr.
dukes'
testimony
that
that
was
a
situation
at
the
beginning
back
in
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
you
said
that
they
were
blocking
the
front
entrances
of
this
courthouse.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
in
this
opinion.
mr.
will
s.
wells
as
to
the
matter,
if
the
court
please,
i
suggest
that
you
will
find
on
page
245
and
246
of
the
appendix
and
mr.
dukes,
the
county
attorney's
testimony
on
246.
i
asked
him
this
question,
“well,
after
these
big
marches
and
his
great
group,
was
there
any
effort
made
to
set
up
some
barricades
and
outline
a
place
where
they
could
picket?”
“it
was
absolutely
necessary,
mr.
wells
because
the
manner
in
which
they
are
raising
to
picket
completely
blocked
the
front
entrance
of
the
courthouse.
and
being
in
january
and
the
tax
paying
time,
we
had
to
make
some
arrangements
for
our
people
to
get
to
the
courthouse
or
barricades
were
set
up
on
north
and
south
of
the
main
street
and
so
forth,
and
asked
them
to
picket
there.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
then
after
the
barricades
were
set
up
and
they
were
asked
to
picket
in
this
one
area,
mr.
justice
fortas,
there
is
no
testimony
other
than
some
testimony
stating
that
during
that
time,
mr.
dukes
testified
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
question
asked
mr.
dukes
by
judge
rives,
i
believe,
just
a
minute
please.
on
page
267
of
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
rives
says,
“mr.
dukes,
may
i
ask
you,
did
any
persons
complain
to
you
as
a
prosecuting
officer,
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
county
that
they
had
undertaken
to
gain
access
to
the
courthouse
and
access
have
been
brought
by
the
witness?”
“judge
rives,
we
had
complaints
since
january
21st
constantly.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
this
is
in
the
appendix.
page
267,
it
is
part
of
the
--
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
full
three-judge
court.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
right.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that
was
the
extent
right
on
--
up
until.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
at
those
small
numbers,
not
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
and
we
knew.
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
right.
now,
if
the
court
would
please,
following
that.
mr.
will
s.
wells
now
following
this
in
april
when
this
statute
was
passed,
and
it
wasn't
passed
just
for
hattiesburg.
we
had
the
situation
in
various
parts
of
the
state.
when
this
statute
was
passed,
it
became
the
law.
on
the
9th
of
april,
the
county
attorney,
the
district
attorney,
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
came
out
about
four
o'clock
and
the
sheriff
asked
these
people
to
stop
--
i
want
to
read
you
something,
is
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
passed
this
statute
and
i
want
you
to
hear
it
read.
and
they
read
the
statute
to
them
in
detail
and
he
said,
“now,
i
do
not
want
to
have
to
arrest
you
people
but
you
cannot
picket
in
such
ways
as
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
the
entrances
and
exits
of
this
courthouse.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
at
that
time,
the
record
is
not
clear
but
there
were
some
15
or
20,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
will
s.
wells
on
that
occasion?
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
he
wanted
to
advice
them
that
as
he
explained
to
them,
the
way
at
times
you
have
been
doing
it,
you
have
been
blocking
these
entrances
and
i
want
you
to
know
it
and
ask
you
to
--
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
picket
but
do
it
in
such
a
way
and
space
yourself
in
such
a
way
as
you
won't
do
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
he
told
them.
mr.
will
s.
wells
now
that
night,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
night
they
had
a
meeting.
they
discussed
the
statute
with
a
lawyer.
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
they
prepared
the
written
statement
for
the
press
and
the
next
morning,
they
came
not
in
these
numbers
but
some
40
of
them
came.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
this
one
later
that
tried
to
get
out
and
then
the
sheriff
and
the
county
attorney
himself
went
out
and
tried
to
see
if
they
could
move
against
it
and
the
pictures
themselves,
if
the
court
please,
in
here
show
it
became
--
it
could
be
a
picket
line
and
became
a
picket
fence
and
it
shows
right
at
their
entrances
that
they
were
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
testimony
from
mrs.
--
testimony
of
mrs.
bricket
beginning
on
page
268
of
the
appendix.
now,
on
the
bottom
of
page
269,
“now,
mrs.
bricket,
in
connection
with
the
duties
of
your
since
she
was
home
demonstration
aid,
do
you
frequently
have
occasion
to
go
to
the
can
agent
so?”
“yes,
sir.”
“generally
by
how?”
“sometimes
four,
five
times
a
day.
it
varies
from
day
to
day.”
and
she
goes
on
and
explains
her
situation
and
the
condition
that
existed
there,
that
day.
she
testified
that
there
were
some
35
or
40
who
were
walking
there
very
close
together.
“did
you
have
on
occasion,
during
the
time
that
that
line
was
being
picketed,
to
go
to
the
courthouse?”
“yes,
sir.
to
pick
up
some
materials.”
“would
you
tell
the
court
just
what
happened
and
how
you
got
there?”
“i
started
the
regular
route
and
they
were
so
close
together
that
i
had
to
wait
for
just
a
moment
to
get
in
line
and
i
fell
in
line
with
them
and
started
weaving
back
and
forth
until
i
reached
until
the
front
steps
and
then

if
the

please,
the
way
that
drawing
came
about
is
this
way.
after
this
hearing
involuntary,
judge
rives
who
was
there
with
his
law
clerk
and
his
law
clerk's
wife
decided
to
go
back
to
montgomery
by
way
of
hattiesburg,
and
he
went
by
and
made
an
inspection
of
the
situation
as
existed
then,
which
was
some
good
long
private
practice
the
same.
and
i
understand
he's
--
and
this
--
i
got
this
information
alone.
i
got
from
him,
so
he's
not
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
--
i
think
how
this
got
into
the
record.
this
was
prepared
by
judge
rives
himself
personally
on
his
law
clerk
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
alright
sir,
the
line
of
march,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
the
lower
part
of
this
drawing
and
to
the
left
is
the
sidewalk
on
the
public
street
coming
on
around
to
eaton
street.
then,
you'll
notice
this
little
--
as
he's
got
it
.31
walk
at
least
from
the
street
running
north,
runs
on
up
by
here.
it
curves
a
little
bit
to
the
left,
the
line
march,
it
comes
back
out,
and
that's
the
circle
they
were
making.
mr.
will

mr.
will

that's
the
width
of
the
walk.
mr.

mrs.

office
--
the
courthouse
is
here
to
the
right
of
this
drawing.
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
other
words,
this
is
a
courthouse
steps
right
here,
in
front
of
them.
and
this
is
the
courthouse
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
she
was
leaving
--
her
office
is
where
this
entrance
to
home
demonstration
office
here
you
see
there,
that's
her
office.
mr.
will
s.

she
comes
out
of
there
and
comes
around
to
her
right
as
she
comes
out
--
mr.

yes,
sir.
and
then
comes
out
into
this
area
and
follows
this
line
in
here
to
go
up
into
the
courthouse.
mr.

the
picket

was
right
across
here.
yes,
sir.
mr.
will

wells
she
had
to
come
in,
couldn't
get
through.
she
had
to
step
in
the
line
and
weave
her
way
until
she
could
get
out.
mr.
will

yes,
sir.
mr.

yes,

mr.
will
s.

yes,
sir.
mr.
will

wells
just
about.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
harlan,
here's
where
--
what
i
see
the
issue
to
be
in
this
case,
is
our
position
that
this
statute
is
about
as
narrowly
drawn
as
it
could
be.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
both
of
them
or
the
last
one
and
the
way
this
came
about
as
there
is
one
that
statute
was
first
passed,
the
word
“unreasonable”
was
not
in
there
preceding
the
word
“interfere”.
it
was
to
obstruct
or
interfere.
to
be
quite
frank,
it
was
my
thinking
that
even
at
court
where
you
talk
about
interfering,
any
little
thing
can
be
interfering
and
i
felt
and
i
still
feel
and
it
was
at
my
suggestion
that
the
legislature
amended
that
statute
and
to
put
the
word
“unreasonable”
before
interfere
because
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
any
court
would
interpret
it
to
be
an
unreasonable
interference
rather
than
just
some
little
interference.
i
think
unreasonable
interference
narrows
it
rather
than
broadens
it
and
it
was
actually
at
my
suggestion
to
legislature
did
that.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
just
exactly
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
the
factual
issue
as
to
whether
anyone
of
them
did,
i
don't
think
it's
for
court
of
equity
to
determine.
i
think
that
the
question
--
the
view
to
determine
here
is
this,
is
this
a
good
faith,
honest
good
faith
prosecution
that's
not
just
done
to
harass
somebody?
can
they
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
courts
of
mississippi?
mr.
will
s.
wells
but
these
pictures
were
put
in
there
for
this
purpose,
to
show
that
at
least
they
have
probable
cause
here
to
justify
some
judge.
now
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
that's
exactly
my
position,
if
the
court
would
please.
that's
exactly
the
position
i
took
with
the
lower
court
and
as
judge
coleman
said,
we
are
not
trying
to
try
these
people
as
to
whether
they
are
guilty
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
alleged
offense
was
committed,
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
april
10,
1964.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
this
cases
could
be
tried
in
--
that
in
the
county
court,
they
could
be
tried
in
short
order.
i
mean
that
i
do
not
grant
at
all.
they
then
could
be
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
on
the
record,
that's
made
there
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
and
then
here.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i'll
say
probably
60
days.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
court
is
up
with
its
docket
for
the
full,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
four
months
outside.
mr.
will
s.
wells
from
the
circuit
court
to
supreme
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
have
actually
raised
it
in
this
case,
in
its
inception
before
they
were
removed.
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes.
mr.
will
s.
wells
and
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
yes,
sir.
and
may
i
say
even
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
even
if
you
would
determine
whether
you
had
the
right
to
do
it,
it's
the
question
of
whether
they're
entitled
any
relief
in
the
criteria
of
dombrowski
in
this
case.
the
theory
on
which
they
ask
for
these
injunctions
to
start
with
was
this,
and
they
admitted
though
for
us
that
the
purpose
of
these
demonstrations
was
voting
registration.
and
in
their
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
all
the
way
through,
that
unless
they
were
enjoined,
there
would
discourage
negroes
from
registering
to
vote
and
correct
they're
moot.
the
facts
in
this
record
show
that
after
the
last
arrests
were
made,
the
ones
that
they
say
that
if
you
stop
us
from
doing
this
it's
going
to
cut
down
the
registration,
the
record
shows
that
from
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
when
there's
picketing
as
much
as
was
seized
that
more
negroes
registered
after
that
until
the
time
of
this
trial
than
had
registered
prior
to
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
this
--
there
was
one
witness
who
testified
in
connection
with
suit
against
mr.
lien,
yes
sir,
the
registrar.
mr.
will
s.
wells
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
has
put
in
strong
that
it
did
not
hurt.
mr.
will
s.
wells
after
these
arrests
on
april
10th
and
11th,
they
continued
to
picket
there
in
smaller
numbers
not
blocking
the
entrance
for
38
days.
mr.
will
s.
wells
and
there
was
no
arrest.
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
just
a
minute,
i'll
come
to
that
if
i
may.
here's
what
happened.
on
the
10th
that
morning,
these
38
or
40
people
were
arrested.
that
afternoon,
there
were
nine
more
arrested.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
were
there
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
just
a
minute
now,
please
sir.
as
soon
as
the
county
attorney
found
out
about
the
nine
arrests
that
afternoon,
all
but
one
were
juveniles.
they
were
immediately
released
to
their
parents
and
no
charges
were
made
against
them
and
have
made
on
against
them.
and
the
one
made
against
the
one
grown
person
that
was
there
leading
them,
if
it
ever
gets
back
to
state
court,
it's
going
to
be
dismissed,
so
they
don't
have
a
problem
with
adjoining
those.
mr.
will
s.
wells
because
she
would
be
there
alone,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
with
these
children.
these
arrests
were
made
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
after
checking
into
it
by
the
county
attorney,
he
felt
these
were
juveniles
in
the
first
place
and
he
felt
that
it
would
not
warrant
to
go
ahead
and
charge
them
with
it.
they
were
released
to
their
parents
and
kept
in
a
short
time.
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice,
sometimes
an
officer
can
make
a
mistake
in
arresting
somebody.
when
somebody
finds
out,
they'll
say,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
prosecute.”
those
things
can
happen,
not
necessarily
in
these
areas
but
in
other
areas,
and
he
felt
it
was
not
enough
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
prosecution.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
they
were
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
they
were
--
14,
15,
16,
and
17
years
old.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
we
feel
we
take
this
position,
if
your
honor
would
please,
this
statute
is
certainly
as
narrowly
drawn
as
i
think
it
could
be
and
we
feel
that
the
state
has
certainly
got
a
right
to
go
no
further
than
they
have.
mr.
will
s.
wells
ex
parte
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
black,
i
have
read
the
case
but
i
frankly
am
not
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
will
s.
wells
but
proof
that
this
thing
shows,
if
your
honor
would
please,
the
very
thing
happened
from
april
11th
until
may
18th,
they
continued
to
picket
in
the
same
area
but
in
small
enough
numbers
not
to
block
anything
and
they
were
not
molested.
on
the
18th
of
may
or
the
28th
of
may
--
back
in
may,
another
large
group
came
and
there
were
some
arrests
made
there
when
they
came
in
large
numbers
again
and
it
blocked.
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
he's
talking
about
that
afternoon
on
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
the
seven
that
he
was
talking
about,
they
actually
were
nine
and
not
seven,
the
ones
i
was
talking
about
by
the
juveniles.
in
may
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
--
in
may
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
in
may,
there
has
--
there
were
some
15
or
20
arrested
in
may
as
i
recall.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think
mr.
dukes
has
testified.
he
was
asked
about
it.
he
said
he
did
not
remember
how
many
but
there
was
a
large
group.
mr.
dukes
has
accounted
to
it.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
the
court
please,
that
i
do
not
know
if
the
record
is
saying
on
that.
they
were
--
that's
what
they
were
charged
with
having
done
in
that
large
group
on
that
day.
we
feel,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
statute
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
2283
is
a
law,
we
feel
first
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
feel
that
there's
no
showing
here
that
it's
being
constitutionally
applied
to
these
people.
the
--
the
argument
about
the
selective
enforcement
is
covered
in
judge
coleman's
opinion
in
dealing
with
parades
in
the
city
and
the
public
street
on
the
one
hand,
that
it
had
nothing
to
with
the
sidewalks
adjoining
the
courthouse
and
walkways
going
in
to
the
courthouse.
they're
not
synonymous
at
all
because
the
statute
doesn't
come
into
place.
even
judge
rives
at
some
of
his
questions,
he
said
the
court
would
be
interested
in
what
he
would
--
what
he
asked
--
judge
rives
asked
mr.
dukes
on
--
on
page
265
of
the
appendix.
and
mr.
dukes,
he
was
the
prosecuting
attorney.
judge
rives,
when
there
was
a
colloquy
between
mr.
smith
and
me
about
the
difference
between
parades
and
the
kind
he
was
talking
about
in
demonstrations.
this
kind
judge
rives
thinks,
said,
“i
think
we'd
get
into
an
argument
on
the
law.”
“i
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
however
can
a
plaintiff
be
granted
to
parade
in
such
a
manner
in
your
opinion
as
to
block
the
entrance
to
the
courthouse?”
by
the
witness,
“no,
sir;
i
do
not
think
so.”
judge
rives,
“in
other
words,
could
the
city
ground
appointment
to
violate
that
statute?”
the
witness,
“did
the
city
grant
appointment
to
march
around
the
courtyard
to
violate
statute?
no,
sir;
i
don't
think
so,”
judge
rives,
“permits
and
the
statute
are
two
separate
things?”
“yes.”
it's
definitely
my
opinion
that
the
city
certainly
could
bring
in
information
to
violate
the
state
statute.
then
judge
coleman,
“let
me
ask
you
this,
the
parading
that
you've
been
talking
about,
was
that
in
the
streets
or
was
that
on
the
courthouse
grounds
and
adjacent
to
the
entrances
to
the
courthouse?”
“it
was
in
the
streets,
your
honor.”
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute
is
not
against
somebody
who
gets
together
with
the
intention
or
with
a
conspiracy
or
with
a
purpose.
it
posed
to
set
down
to
this,
that
you
actually
do
it.
that
you
actually
do
it,
that's
why
this
is
prohibited.
there's
no
prohibition
against
picketing.
there's
not
prohibition
against
anything
else.
you
just
says
this,
you
can't
do
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
obstruct
or
unreasonably
interfere
with
ingress
and
egress
to
the
entrance
of
this
building.
that's
all
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
no,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
for
a
group
of
people
to
parade
down
the
public
street
of
hattiesburg
and
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse
is
a
matter
to
be
controlled
by
the
city
of
hattiesburg.
now,
that's
a
different
situation
from
--
that
would
keep
you
from
going
across
the
street,
to
get
across
that
street
over
here.
that's
all
for
a
short
length
of
time,
just
to
parade
there
should
not
keep
them
and
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
one
way
or
the
other.
but
this
statute
says
this,
you
can't
--
mr.
will
s.
wells
the
only
question
is
that
the
record
said
this,
does
that
parade
pass
in
front
of
the
courthouse?
yes.
could
people
get
from
across
over
the
beacon
street
while
the
parade
is
passing
by?
he
said,
no.
for
a
minute,
they
could.
just
five
minutes
the
parade
goes
by
and
they
can
come
across
the
street.
but
that's
not
the
--
that's
not
all
on
the
courthouse.
this
courthouse
sits
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
the
square.
streets
come
in
and
out
of
its
way
from
this
one.
i
think
he's
been
the
streets
in
hattiesburg
with
stalls
and
so
forth
on
it
outside
and
the
only
thing
this
thing
would
prohibit
there
is
this,
don't
demonstrate
in
such
ways
as
to
block
or
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
these
entrances.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
think
the
sheriff
would
have
the
right
to
go
out
there,
yes
sir,
and
enforce
the
statute
on
them.
they
would
have
the
right.
mr.
will
s.
wells
if
they
insisted
on
staying
right
there
and
would
prevent
them
from
getting
there,
i
think
he
would
have
that
right
to
charge
them,
yes.
this
is,
as
mr.
justice
black
said,
just
stop
there.
mr.
will
s.
wells
there
had
to
be
some
rule
of
reason.
mr.
will
s.
wells
i
don't
think
he
would.
no,
sir.
and
i
think
if
a
civil
rights
group
stopped
there,
he
would
not
arrest
them
either
at
the
streets.
mr.
will
s.
wells
mr.
justice
marshall,
situations
have
changed
dramatically
in
mississippi,
sir,
since
you
were
last
there,
i
am
happy
to
say.
mr.
will
s.
wells
well,
they
changed
then
--
they
had
changed
even
then,
if
you
were
there
a
month
or
so
ago
since
you
were
a
long
time
ago
sir,
considerably
so.
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
have
done
what
i
can
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
to
help
change
--
i've
done
my
best
to
have
--
even
judge
rives
complimented
me
when
i
before
the
fifth
circuit
recently
but
in
fact,
he
said
you
all
had
done
a
good
job
in
mississippi
a
whole
lot
better
than
we
are
in
alabama
and
i
think
some
of
the
--
some
of
it
--
you
were
entitled
to
create
some
of
it.
mr.
wells
and
i
rather
appreciate
it
even
though
he
wrote
the
dissent
in
this
case.
