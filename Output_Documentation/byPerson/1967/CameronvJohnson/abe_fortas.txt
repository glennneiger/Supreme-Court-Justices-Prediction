justice
abe
fortas
mr.
smith,
what
would
be
the
issues
in
the
injunction
suit?
i
know
that
mr.
kinoy
is
going
to
talk
about
dombrowski
but
would
that
be
--
would
the
question
be
whether
the
defendants
in
the
state
proceeding
had
violated
the
state
statute?
would
that
play
a
part
in
it?
justice
abe
fortas
or
would
it
just
be
whether
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
would
there
be
any
factual
issues
--
would
any
factual
issues
be
relevant?
justice
abe
fortas
and
going
beyond
that,
suppose
the
federal
court
or
district
court
decided
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
it's
not
being
used
to
what
i'd
call
for
brief
of
dombrowski
way
to
harass
people.
does
the
court
go
on
to
find
out
whether
it
was
improperly
applied
or
unconstitutionally
applied
–
justice
abe
fortas
--
separate
things?
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
those
two
things
be
involved
as
you
said,
whether
the
statute
was
being
improperly
applied
to
people
who
have
been
really
violated?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
sure
there
was
in
dombrowski,
maybe,
but
in
any
event,
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
we're
really
trying
a
criminal
case
on
the
equity
side
of
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
about
right.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
i
had
a
look
at
the
record
and
i
understand
what
you're
doing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
trying
to
get
your
view
of
it
as
a
matter
of
theory.
for
example,
in
this
case,
an
issue
in
the
injunction
proceeding
would
be
whether
these
people
did
or
didn't,
might
be
that
the
court
got
passed
preliminary
constitutional
question,
whether
these
people
did
or
did
not
block
access
to
the
courthouse?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
statement
comparable
to
the
statement
on
page
74
of
your
brief
with
respect
to
the
blocking
of
access
to
courthouses?
it's
the
first
part
of
the
statute
here
under
which
these
people
are
prosecuted
relates
to
blocking
courthouses
and
public
buildings.
the
second
part
of
it
relates
to
free
use
of
the
streets.
the
--
what
you
have
referred
to
as
a
concession
as
it
appears
on
page
74
as
i
read
it
relates
only
to
blocking
the
streets.
now,
is
there
anything
like
that
with
respect
to
blocking
access
to
public
buildings
or
courthouses?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
--
excuse
me,
mr.
kinoy,
but
i
suppose
it's
at
least
arguable
that
the
insertion
of
the
word
“unreasonably”
in
the
1964
amendment
can
really
make
any
substantial
difference
because
there
is
an
element
of
judgment
in
the
other
statutory
word
whether
a
particular
activity
constitutes
obstructing
or
interfering
with
free
ingress
or
regress.
justice
abe
fortas
sir,
you
don't
really
make
much
point
of
the
existence
or
the
non-existence
of
the
word
“unreasonably”
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
possible
in
your
judgment
to
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
blocking
ingress
or
regress
to
public
buildings
or
to
streets
that
were
not
the
subject
to
that
infirmity?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
you
phrase
it?
justice
abe
fortas
phrase
--
phrase
it
partly
for
me.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
really
mean
that
word,
do
you?
reasonable,
would
you
let
that
go
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
would
you
or
would
you
not
agree
that
merely
because
people
are
exercising
the
right
of
free
speech,
they
do
not
have
a
total
immunity
to
block
what
goes
on
in
the
public
buildings
or
even
the
block
access
to
public
buildings?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
or
would
you
not
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kinoy,
wasn't
there
some
statute
in
mississippi
prior
to
the
indictment
of
this
one
that
would
have
made
blocking
access
to
courthouses
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
those
cited
in
your
brief?
you
can
just
tell
me
yes
or
no.
i
don't
want
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
evidence
that
--
of
anybody
who
was
blocked
from
ingress
or
regress
who
could
not
go
in
to
the
courthouse
or
who
could
not
come
out
of
it
without
being
interfered
with?
justice
abe
fortas
at
any
time.
justice
abe
fortas
i
remember
that
testimony
and
perhaps
one
may
regard
it
as
impressive
or
not
impressive.
i
also
remember
--
seem
to
remember
that
it
said
that
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking.
is
anything
like
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
that
people
could
not
get
in
to
the
front
of
the
courthouse.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
and
after
--
but
after
the
barricades
were
set
up
and
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
there's
no
such
testimony,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
you
can
help
me
on
this.
i
find
--
i
may
misunderstand
this
but
i
find
mrs.
bricket's
testimony
very
unimpressive
that
i
get
the
picture
correctly
or
maybe
i
don't.
she
said
she
came
out
of
her
office
and
she
had
to
go
on
a
walk,
which
was
why
it's
enough
for
only
person
at
the
walk
so
that
you
couldn't
have
two
people
walking
abreast.
and
there
was
a
picket
line
there
and
in
order
to
get
to
where
she
was
going,
she
had
to
fall
in
line
--
fall
in
behind
some
of
the
pickets.
am
i
wrong
about
that
picture

i
read
it
on
270?
