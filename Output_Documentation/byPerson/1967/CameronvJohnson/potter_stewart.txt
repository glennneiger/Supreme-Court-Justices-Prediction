justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
exact
--
precise
word
that's
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
question;
that's
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
because
of
other
provisions
in
the
fourth
amendment
which
states
that
no
warrant
shall
issue
except
upon
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
chronology
here,
mr.
kinoy.
at
the
time
of
these
arrests,
did
the
statute
read
as
it
now
does
or
as
it
formally
did.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
--
under
what
statute
would
these
people
be
prosecuted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
prosecutions
however
of
your
present
clients
would
be
under
the
original
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
injunction
asks
what?
not
only
the
--
that
these
prosecutions
be
enjoined
but
that
all
future
prosecutions
of
any
kind
under
the
statute
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kinoy,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
--
perhaps
i
misunderstand,
mr.
kinoy,
but
this
conduct
at
the
entrance
or
near
the
entrance
to
the
courthouse
had
been
going
on
for
several
weeks
with
the,
at
least
implicit
if
not
explicit
permission
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
local
authorities
for
two
months.
then,
what
caused
the
change,
as
i
understand
it,
was
the
enactment
of
this
statute
by
the
legislature
of
mississippi.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
statute
was
then
read
to
these
people
after
it
was
enacted.
a
copy
was
sent
down
to
this
place
and
they
copied,
and
this
law
was
read
to
these
people.
they
were
told
about
it
and
they
were
told,
“now,
this
is
illegal.
now,
disperse.”
isn't
that
it?
this
wasn't
something
just
a
change
of
mind
by
the
police
as
you
replied,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
enactment
of
a
law
by
the
legislature
of
mississippi,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
making
it
illegal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
block
ingress
into
the
courthouse.
until
then
it
had
not
been
illegal.
until
then,
the
police
would
have
been
taking
the
law
in
their
own
hands
of
they
had
arrested
these
people
for
blocking
it
presumably.
after
the
legislator
--
the
legislature
passed
the
law,
the
police
told
these
people
about
the
passage
of
the
law,
said
it's
now
illegal,
now
disperse.
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
--
these
are
just
the
offset
of
police
action.
this
is
legislative
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
which
the
enforcement
officers
told
these
people,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can't
find
that
in
the
language
of
the
section
1
of
the
law
that
was
passed.
it
simply
it's
illegal
to
--
among
other
things
to
block
egress
or
ingress
in
a
public
building,
including
a
courthouse.
justice
potter
stewart
which
court's
opinion
at
peacock
or
which
peacock
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
cited
all
those
charges,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
parade
ordinance
in
hattiesburg?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
exact
--
precise
word
that's
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
