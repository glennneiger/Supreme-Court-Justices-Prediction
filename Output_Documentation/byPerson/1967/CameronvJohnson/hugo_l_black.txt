justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said,
which
i
remember
this
court
has
dissented.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
every
member
of
this
court
has
conceded
that
a
state
is
without
power,
constitutional
power
to
prevent
people
marching
round
and
round
the
building
on
the
street?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
has
not,
what
is
the
relief
you
ask?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
concession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
showing
the
concession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
mr.
kinoy,
is
it
also
that
they
could
not
get
the
cases
tried
fairly
in
the
courts
of
mississippi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
do
agree
if
the
federal
government
somehow
--
or
the
states
somehow
protected
that
public
building
like
this
one,
like
the
court
is
being
held
from
having
people
come
up
and
block
access
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
want
to
say
that
the
officer
has
the
right
to
decide
for
himself
where
there's
a
problem
for
them
to
walk
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
hold
that
--
you
would
say
that
officers,
deputy
chairs
or
policemen
and
so
forth
cannot
decide
for
himself
whether
it's
reasonable
for
them
to
do
it,
cannot
make
any
law
by
telling
them
they
can
come
in,
but
he
can
--
to
bar
it,
but
he
can
make
it
a
law
to
say
you
can
come
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
say
that
they
have
the
right
to
--
which
the
state
cannot
prevent
to
march
up
and
down
the
streets
that
are
dedicated
to
travelers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
the
pictures?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
take
the
position
as
i
understand
it
the
natural
and
normal
way
to
try
to
defend
it
in
this
country
is
where
he
is
in
a
court
charged
with
the
offense
and
can
get
a
trial
by
jury
that
he
is
entitled
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you
--
we
are
not
here
to
pass
on
that
question
at
this
time
after
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
either
one
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
law
in
mississippi
that
forbids
the
defendants
to
raise
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
mississippi
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
mississippi
is
not
responsible
for
having
the
little
child
in
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
are
you
familiar
with
ex
parte
young?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
--
our
case
of
ex
parte
young
where
prosecutions
were
enjoined
and
this
court
sustained
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
showed
that
unless
an
injunction
was
issued,
there
would
be
various
harassments
such
as
constantly
arresting,
increasing
the
fine
from
day
to
day
so
that
it
might
be
within
a
few
weeks,
a
fine
of
a
million
dollars
would
be
imposed,
and
various
things
like
where
the
state
was
about
to
harass
these
people
to
death.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
was
still
--
and
those
circumstances
will
require
--
was
held
that
the
state
could
be
enjoined
from
doing
it
under
they
could
get
it
tested
in
way
which
did
not
take
all
their
money
away
from
them
and
send
them
to
jail
for
life.
has
there
been
any
threat
like
that
in
mississippi
in
these
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
take
that
case
is
more
relevant
than
dombrowski.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
parade
that
had
started
up
and
down
the
streets
would
have
stopped
in
front
of
the
courthouse
and
blocked
the
entrances,
would
it
be
barred?
