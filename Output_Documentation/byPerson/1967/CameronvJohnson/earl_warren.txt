mr.

chief
justice
earl

can
anyone
parade
at
anytime
he
wants,
sir?
chief

earl

but
if
civil
rights
workers
want
to
parade
through
the
streets
and
have
signs
such
as
they
had
in
this
situation,
are
they
free
to
do
it?
chief

the
authorities
wouldn't
interfere
in
any
way?
chief

any

of

chief

earl

is
that
--
is
any
of
this
in

record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
rather
objecting
to
mr.
smith's
speaking
of
the
record.
i
was
just
wondering
if
all
of
this
you've
told
us
is
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
before.
i
mean
what
you
were
saying
before
about
the
conditions
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
they
are
free
to
parade
and
so
forth
at
any
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it?
where
do
we
find
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
is
this
testimony?
can
you
find
this
testimony
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
a
part
of
the
evidentiary
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
this
question
and
answer
isn't
more
column
heading.
on
page
246,
i
guess
it's
mr.
dukes
who
is
testifying
and
mr.
wells
was
asking
a
question
yourself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
“now,
starting
about
around
april
1st,
mr.
dukes,
i
believe
they
were
picketing
their
free
will
everyday.”
answer,
“i
believe
that's
correct.”
“were
they
in
any
great
large
numbers
at
that
time?”
answer,
“it
would
vary,
mr.
wells.
they
were
not
in
these
large
numbers,
of
course.
this
came
on
january
22nd,
which
was
several
hundred.
but
it
would
vary
anywhere
from
7,
8,
13,
14,
15,
and
so
forth,
some
grown,
some
young.”
now,
is
that
the
--
was
that
the
extent
of
the
picketing
after
--
after
the
police
blocked
off
the
way,
6
or
7
or
8
or
up
to
13,
14,
15,
some
young
and
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
someone
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
while
that
was
being
done
in
that
--
in
that
degree,
was
there
any
effort
on
the
part
of
these
people
to
block
anyone
from
the
entry
or
exit
from
the
courthouse,
or
was
there
anything
done
by
them
that
had
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
last
two
months
or
so,
there
was
no
interference
of
any
kind
with
anybody
going
into
that
courthouse.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
testimony
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
you
say
the
walkway
was,
were
prescribed
by
the
authorities
for
these
people
to
walk
around?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
what's
in
the
records,
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
that,
is
there
--
isn't
there
also
the
question
as
to
whether
--
whether
these
people
did
demonstrate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
free
ingress
or
egress
to
or
from
any
public
premises?
now,
isn't
--
isn't
that
an
issue
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
--
you
have
put
in
this
record
all
of
these
diagrams
and
you
put
all
these
pictures
in
here
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
demonstration.
now,
isn't
it
an
issue
in
this
case
whether
--
whether
they
did
obstruct
or
in
such
a
manner
the
ingress
or
egress
tour
from
--
do
you
want
us
to
forget
about
those
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
it
take
between
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
long
would
it
--
would
it
take
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
decide
this
case
normally?
now,
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
this
kind
of
cases
normally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
four
months
outside,
four
months
from
the
time
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
going
to
be
dismissed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
young
were
they?
as
young
as
one
of
the
little
children
shown
in
these
pictures
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
--
there's
a
little
child
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
were
align
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
were
the
seven
that
mr.
kinoy
spoke
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
seven
he
told?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
on
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
obstruct
anybody's
ability
to
enter
or
leave
the
courthouse
in
the
following
occasions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
a
few
moments
ago
when
you
said
you
thought
this
statute
was
drawn
as
tightly
as
it
could
be
done,
i
was
wondering
why
it
couldn't
have
said
that
any
--
any
group
of
people
who
mass
with
the
intention
of
blocking
off
the
ingress
and
egress
from
the
--
from
the
courthouse.
i'm
wondering
why
--
that
couldn't
have
been
said
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understand
it,
your
record
shows
that
they
have
parades
that
blocked
the
whole
street
so
that
people
cannot
--
cannot
get
in
or
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
courthouse
and
that
the
sanction
that
is
permitted
under
this
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
those
are
--
some
people
go
with
some
signs
saying
that
people
in
mississippi
are
citizens
also,
that
it's
selectively
enforced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
--
you
told
us
that
there
was
no
regulation
on
--
on
whatsoever,
on
parades
and
on
anybody
and
then
in
numbers
that
they
wanted
or
for
any
purpose
if
they
wanted,
could
parade
--
parade
throughout
the
streets
of
hattiesburg
and
this
record
shows
that
they
do
not
enforce
that
even
though
the
streets
are
blocked
so
people
can't
get
across
to
the
courthouse.
