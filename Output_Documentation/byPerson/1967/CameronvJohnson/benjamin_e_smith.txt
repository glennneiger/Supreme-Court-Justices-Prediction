mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
district
court
below
in
this
matter
was
directed
by
this
court
per
curiam
in
1966
to
reconsider
this
matter.
this
is
a
--
an
injunction
case
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
heard
before
a
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
the
injunction
should
not
issue.
they
appealed
that
to
this
court
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
sent
the
matter
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
with
instructions
that
the
per
curiam
--
with
instructions
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
requested
to
halt
state
prosecutions
of
civil
rights
workers
should
be
considered
in
one;
whether
or
not
title
28
section
2283
the
writ
prohibition,
the
injunction
prohibition
statute
apply
and
secondly;
whether
or
not
the
injunction
should
issue
by
virtue
of
the
meeting
of
the
criteria
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
dombrowski
case.
this
court
therefore
is
familiar
with
the
case.
this
is
the
second
time
it's
been
here.
briefly,
the
injunction
was
filed
in
april
1964.
first
judge
hearing
--
the
three-judge
hearing
was
in
july
of
that
year.
this
court's
first
opinion
was
in
july
of
1965.
we
retried
the
case
in
october
and
it
was
decided
--
october
1965
and
it
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
in
december
1966.
there
are
approximately
51
or
55
state
criminal
proceedings
pending
and
it's
based
upon
a
statute.
they
are
based
upon
a
statute
which
forbids
blocking
the
ingress
and
egress,
unreasonably
blocking
the
ingress
and
egress
to
courthouses
in
mississippi.
i
will
discuss
the
2283
problem.
my
colleague,
mr.
kinoy
will
discuss
the
case
as
the
facts
relate
to
the
dombrowski
case.
basically,
we
take
the
position
that
2283
of
title
28
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute.
it
is
a
comity
statute.
it
cannot
prevent
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
or
the
consideration
of
the
injunction
sought
in
this
case.
judge
rives,
circuit
judge
rives
below
who
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
three-judge
court
agreed
with
us
in
this
regard.
he
said
simply
very
quickly
on,
“i
would
hold”
and
this
is
on
page
60
of
the
transcript,
“i
would
hold
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
if
the
allegations
are
approved,
section
1983
which
is
the
basis
for
the
injunction
suits
sought
below,
section
1983
is
an
express
exception
to
section
2283.”
and
he
says
again,
“the
principles
rationally
extrapolated
from
the
cases
creating
express
exceptions
to
the
prohibition
of
section
2283
derive
content
from
the
concrete
situations
which
gave
rise
to
them.
where
a
specific,
limited
and
clearly
delineated
substantive
right
has
been
conferred
by
congress,
the
courts
have
found
an
express
exception
to
section
2283.
the
express
exception
is
the
necessary
co-commitment
of
the
need
to
vindicate
federally
created
rights
and
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
history
of
section
2283.
that
appears
on
section
--
on
page
63
of
the
record.
now,
we
take
the
position
your
honors
that
this
is
a
comity
statute,
that
is
section
2283
is
a
comity
statute,
that
it
has
to
be
understood
and
explained
and
utilized
in
a
comity
situation.
what
was
meant
when
section
1983
was
drawn
up
by
the
reconstruction
congress,
it
meant
that
these
federally
--
given
federally
determined
rights
were
going
to
be
used
to
protect
the
newly
freed
slaves,
that
they
were
going
to
be
used
to
vindicate
federal
rights
and
federal
courts
in
the
southern
states.
and
that
section
1983
was
going
to
see
to
it
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
fully
implemented,
fully
carried
out
and
it
gave
equitable
relief
under
1983
to
the
individual
suitor,
to
individuals
who
could
come
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction,
and
that's
what
the
individual
suitor
is
doing
here.
these
people
in
mississippi
were
involved
in
a
voter
registration
drive
and
you
can
see
from
the
pictures
in
the
record,
they
were
walking
around
the
courthouse
with
signs
that
said,
“mississippians
are
americans,
too.
we
want
the
right
to
vote,”
entirely,
completely,
utterly
peaceful
demonstration.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
the
voting
act
as
well
as
the
one
of
1964,
too,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
these
were
federal
rights
that
they
were
trying
to
protect.
they
were
really
talking
in
terms
of
section
1971
and
then
later
section
1973(b)(i)
or
(i)(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and
they
were
trying
i
think
--
of
course,
it's
pretty
obvious
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
they're
trying
to
get
people
to
register
vote,
but
there
is
just
as
much
reason
for
saying
that
section
1971
gives
these
people
an
expressly
authorized
congressional
authority
to
come
in
and
ask
for
this
injunction
as
it
is
to
say
section
2038
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
the
same
thing
attached
to
it.
and
we
also
know
that
--
for
example,
when
this
court
decided
the
rachel
case.
they
decided
it's
of
title
2
of
the
public
accommodations.
they
gave
an
actual
thrust,
in
other
words,
the
positive
requirement
that
there
have
been
injunction
sought
or
there
be
relief
sought,
this
authorized
removal.
well,
here
this
court
by
turning
down
certiorari
in
the
hamer
versus
campell
case
where
there
was
an
injunction
sought
and
overturning
of
election,
here
was
a
private
citizen
coming
in
under
1983
and
other
related
statutes,
attempting
to
exert
a
right
and
here,
you
didn't
hold
that
2283
was
a
ban.
2283
cannot
be
a
ban
in
this
case.
if
2283
comes
into
play,
it
cannot
come
into
play
in
this
situation
simply
because
if
the
criteria
set
forth
in
dombrowski
are
met,
well
then
this
isn't
expressly
an
authorized
exception
to
the
case.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
case
for
example
in
potter
versus
dixon,
in
rachel
and
in
us
versus
woods
and
all
those
cases
we're
citing
in
the
brief,
the
court
has
every
time
made
an
exception
and
said
this
is
an
expressly
authorized
exception
to
2283.
you
can
come
in
and
file
these
injunction
proceedings.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
that's
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
here.
the
other
--
my
opponent,
mr.
wells
in
his
brief
talks
about
the
baines
case
being
a
bar
and
that's
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
but
when
that
case
was
decided,
this
court
had
not
come
down
with
a
dombrowski
hearing
yet
and
was
pretty
clear
that
the
same
judge
who
wrote
the
baines
opinion,
later
on
came
out
and
talked
in
terms
of
dombrowski
which
was
now
then
available
to
him
in
the
case
of
unites
steel
workers
of
america
versus
bagwell
which
is
383
federal
reporter
2nd
the
september
1967
case
in
which
he
says
on
page
495
the
abstention
doctrine
warrants
refusal
to
exercise
properly
invoked
federal
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
statute's
applicability
to
the
challenger
or
to
his
conduct
and
when
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state
courts
may
remove
the
constitutional
issue
from
the
case.
when
however
the
statute
is
obviously
applicable
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
course
of
conduct
that
when
the
statute
is
not
susceptible
to
a
construction
that
will
otherwise
avoid
the
necessity
of
deciding
the
constitutional
question,
a
federal
court
may
not
properly
state
its
hand.
so
really
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
we're
not
so
much
in
exception,
expressly
authorized
by
the
congress
but
where
you
have
the
federally
given
rights
as
you
do
in
section
1983
of
title
42,
you
have
a
positive
federal
burden
and
duty
to
step
in
and
issue
the
injunction
to
protect
the
issuance
of
--
to
protect
those
rights
so
that
1983
is
not
a
bar.
it
is
a
positive
statement
under
the
theory
of
comity
that
there
has
to
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
either
the
federal
government
or
the
individual
litigant
to
go
forward
and
issue
the
injunction
or
to
hold
the
hearing
and
see
if
the
injunction
should
issue.
this
was
made
all
the
more
clear
when
this
court
decided
the
peacock
case
because
when
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
decision
in
peacock
in
a
portion
of
the
opinion
as
this
court
well
knows,
denying
the
right
of
removal
in
that
case,
he
said
in
effect
and
i
don't
need
to
quote
it,
that
there
should
be
--
there
will
be
other
remedies
available
and
one
of
these
other
remedies
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
peacock
opinion
was
the
remedy
of
injunction.
now,
this
is
the
remedy
we're
seeking
here.
i
say
to
you
gentlemen
here
now,
we've
lost
the
removal
in
peacock.
we
can
no
longer
--
the
situation
in
the
south
is
still
bad.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
in
voting
situations,
there
is
still
violence
going
on.
there
are
shootings
going
on,
and
we
know
that
there
were
some
last
night
in
front
of
(inaudible)
house
down
there
in
mississippi
a
shotgun
went
off.
we
still
have
a
voting
problem
down
there.
i
don't
care
how
many
acts
you're
going
to
pass,
you're
still
are
going
to
have
this
problem
and
we
still
need
some
protection.
we
didn't
get
it
in
peacock
but
we're
back
now
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel.
if
we
don't
get
it
with
the
injunction
procedure,
we're
going
to
be
in
serious
trouble
down
there.
what
you're
saying
--
alright,
i
can
understand
how
you
would
feel
about
removal
when
a
lawyer
can
come
in
and
simply
file
a
removal
petition
and
he
ties
up
the
docket
of
the
federal
court,
the
court
has
to
hold
a
hearing.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
about
that
when
we
argued
peacock
about
the
problems
involved.
but
here,
you
have
a
more
precise
remedy
available
to
you.
you
have
an
injunction
proceeding
which
is
a
more
delicate
remedy.
it's
one
that
will
only
tie
up
the
federal
courts
and
their
dockets
if
the
judge,
after
hearing
or
looking
at
the
case
feels
that
he's
got
something
that
ought
to
be
looked
into.
does
it
meet
the
dombrowski
criteria?
the
whole
situation
would
be
--
i
think
would
resolve
itself
differently.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
factual
issues
would
be
relevant.
i
don't
think
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
would
be
the
relevant
issue,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
first
of
all,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
would
be
an
important
threshold
question.
secondly,
i
think
that
we
find
that
--
i
think
even
in
the
per
curiam
remand
dissent
that
mr.
justice
black
wrote
in
this
case,
he
said
that
if
it
was
a
valid
statute
and
it
was
being
enforced
to
harass
somebody,
well
then
that
would
be
a
proper
fit
--
subject
for
the
hearing,
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
surely.
i
think
you
use
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
--
i
think
you'd
use
the
whole
question
of
selective
enforcement,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
that
would
be
involved
in
it,
just
as
it
was
in
dombrowski.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
that's
what's
the
situation
is.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
that's
--
if
you
look
at
the
record,
that's
about
what
we
did
--
what
we
did
here.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
that
would
--
that
would
be
part
of
it.
i
think
i
said
in
the
removal
petition
that
i
draft
--
i
mean
the
injunction
that
i
drafted,
i
think
i
did
put
in
there,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
they
were
not
guilty
of
what
they
were
charged.
but
the
question
i
think
basically
on
the
hearing
would
be
whether
the
statute
was
being
used
to
harass
this
civil
rights
work
because
that's
fundamentally
the
basic
question
and
it
becomes
a
lot
easier
to
determine
where
there
is
harassment
if
one
goes
into
the
statute
itself.
i
think
mr.
kinoy
is
going
to
develop
that,
but
you
can
see
if
you
have
an
invalid
statute
how
funny
it
looks
to
try
to
enforce
it
many
times
and
i
think
that
shows
up
in
this
record,
too.
so
that
when
you
have
these
criteria
here,
i
think
you
got
such
a
very
strong
thrust
behind
the
whole
question
of
federal
rights,
that
this
question
2283
just
passes
right
out
the
window.
and
really,
if
you
read
judge
rives'
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
hearing,
that
is
the
one
in
1965
which
came
down
to
1966,
you'll
see
that
that's
really
--
he
says
the
threshold
question
merges
into
the
large
question
immediately.
he
says
if
you
have
alleged
and
can
show
the
dombrowksi
type
criteria,
he
thinks
the
foundation
for
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
is
there
and
the
exception
under
2283
is
already
brought
into
existence
so
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
cooper?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
cuder,
oh
yes,
that
was
the
one
i
was
reading
here.
i
would
say
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
as
effective
in
holding
--
in
stopping
the
prosecutions,
which
is
what
we're
looking
at
here,
i
would
think.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
of
course
i
guess
we're
there
because
after
the
original
petition
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right,
right,
i
agree.
i'm
just
simply
saying
when
i
drafted
my
original
papers
in
the
three-judge
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
made
it
a
petition
for
an
injunction
and
a
class
action
followed
by
amendment.
i
didn't
ask
as
i
recall
--
now
i'm
looking
at
the
pleadings
in
this
regard,
i
don't
believe
i
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
i
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
prosecution
that
of
course
i
later
removed
them
in
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
it
might
be
of
service
to
me.
i
don't
know
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
yes.
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
would
be.
i
guess
the
effect
would
naturally
be
to
stop
the
prosecutions
because
they
wouldn't
have
a
statute
under
which
they
could
prosecute.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
would
be
alright.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no.
i
guess
what
happened
in
jeanette
was
in
effect
of
the
injunction.
since
it
happened
the
same
day,
really
it
wouldn't
have
to
happen
at
the
same
day.
but
no,
i
hadn't
thought
about
it
in
those
--
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
can
see
where
it
would
a
declaratory
judgment,
particularly
where
you
have
a
statute
that
is
facially
unconstitutional
as
we've
alleged
in
this
case.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that's
going
to
be
facially
correct,
but
is
being
utilized
in
another
fashion
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
we
went
both
routes.
we
went
both
routes
on
it.
and
--
well
actually,
the
american
law
institute
has
addressed
itself
to
this
whole
question,
in
their
tentative
draft
number
five
which
they
considered
last
may.
they
talked
in
terms
of
what
changes
were
brought
in
this
section,
in
the
area
of
the
law
by
the
peacock
decision,
and
rachel
as
well,
and
they
were
the
ones
that
came
up
in
their
commentary
on
pages
112
and
113
that
talk
about
the
whole
business
of
strengthening
the
government's
or
the
person's
or
the
individual
litigant's
right
to
bring
the
injunction
and
the
whole
idea
that
2283
is
not
a
bar
to
the
bringing
of
the
injunction.
i
would
think,
your
honors,
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
facts
are
going
to
show
that
the
criteria
set
forth
in
the
opinion
written
by
you,
mr.
justice
brennan,
are
met
and
when
they're
met,
then
there
should
be
an
injunction
issue.
the
whole
question
or
the
issue
of
the
injunction
should
then
come
up.
it
should
not
bar
the
courts
to
these
injunctions.
if
we
don't
have
the
injunction,
the
only
thing
left
for
us
is
habeas.
we've
lost
in
--
with
removal.
we've
got
to
some
way
protect
these
federally
constitutional,
federally
protected,
federally
defined
rights.
and
injunction,
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
guess
along
with
the
discussion
of
the
panel
on
declaratory
judgment
is
just
about
all
that's
left
in
many
of
these
situations
and
i
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
district
court
below
in
this
matter
was
directed
by
this
court
per
curiam
in
1966
to
reconsider
this
matter.
this
is
a
--
an
injunction
case
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
heard
before
a
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
the
injunction
should
not
issue.
they
appealed
that
to
this
court
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
sent
the
matter
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
with
instructions
that
the
per
curiam
--
with
instructions
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
requested
to
halt
state
prosecutions
of
civil
rights
workers
should
be
considered
in
one;
whether
or
not
title
28
section
2283
the
writ
prohibition,
the
injunction
prohibition
statute
apply
and
secondly;
whether
or
not
the
injunction
should
issue
by
virtue
of
the
meeting
of
the
criteria
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
dombrowski
case.
this
court
therefore
is
familiar
with
the
case.
this
is
the
second
time
it's
been
here.
briefly,
the
injunction
was
filed
in
april
1964.
first
judge
hearing
--
the
three-judge
hearing
was
in
july
of
that
year.
this
court's
first
opinion
was
in
july
of
1965.
we
retried
the
case
in
october
and
it
was
decided
--
october
1965
and
it
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
in
december
1966.
there
are
approximately
51
or
55
state
criminal
proceedings
pending
and
it's
based
upon
a
statute.
they
are
based
upon
a
statute
which
forbids
blocking
the
ingress
and
egress,
unreasonably
blocking
the
ingress
and
egress
to
courthouses
in
mississippi.
i
will
discuss
the
2283
problem.
my
colleague,
mr.
kinoy
will
discuss
the
case
as
the
facts
relate
to
the
dombrowski
case.
basically,
we
take
the
position
that
2283
of
title
28
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute.
it
is
a
comity
statute.
it
cannot
prevent
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
or
the
consideration
of
the
injunction
sought
in
this
case.
judge
rives,
circuit
judge
rives
below
who
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
three-judge
court
agreed
with
us
in
this
regard.
he
said
simply
very
quickly
on,
“i
would
hold”
and
this
is
on
page
60
of
the
transcript,
“i
would
hold
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
if
the
allegations
are
approved,
section
1983
which
is
the
basis
for
the
injunction
suits
sought
below,
section
1983
is
an
express
exception
to
section
2283.”
and
he
says
again,
“the
principles
rationally
extrapolated
from
the
cases
creating
express
exceptions
to
the
prohibition
of
section
2283
derive
content
from
the
concrete
situations
which
gave
rise
to
them.
where
a
specific,
limited
and
clearly
delineated
substantive
right
has
been
conferred
by
congress,
the
courts
have
found
an
express
exception
to
section
2283.
the
express
exception
is
the
necessary
co-commitment
of
the
need
to
vindicate
federally
created
rights
and
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
history
of
section
2283.
that
appears
on
section
--
on
page
63
of
the
record.
now,
we
take
the
position
your
honors
that
this
is
a
comity
statute,
that
is
section
2283
is
a
comity
statute,
that
it
has
to
be
understood
and
explained
and
utilized
in
a
comity
situation.
what
was
meant
when
section
1983
was
drawn
up
by
the
reconstruction
congress,
it
meant
that
these
federally
--
given
federally
determined
rights
were
going
to
be
used
to
protect
the
newly
freed
slaves,
that
they
were
going
to
be
used
to
vindicate
federal
rights
and
federal
courts
in
the
southern
states.
and
that
section
1983
was
going
to
see
to
it
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
fully
implemented,
fully
carried
out
and
it
gave
equitable
relief
under
1983
to
the
individual
suitor,
to
individuals
who
could
come
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction,
and
that's
what
the
individual
suitor
is
doing
here.
these
people
in
mississippi
were
involved
in
a
voter
registration
drive
and
you
can
see
from
the
pictures
in
the
record,
they
were
walking
around
the
courthouse
with
signs
that
said,
“mississippians
are
americans,
too.
we
want
the
right
to
vote,”
entirely,
completely,
utterly
peaceful
demonstration.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
the
voting
act
as
well
as
the
one
of
1964,
too,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
these
were
federal
rights
that
they
were
trying
to
protect.
they
were
really
talking
in
terms
of
section
1971
and
then
later
section
1973(b)(i)
or
(i)(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and
they
were
trying
i
think
--
of
course,
it's
pretty
obvious
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
they're
trying
to
get
people
to
register
vote,
but
there
is
just
as
much
reason
for
saying
that
section
1971
gives
these
people
an
expressly
authorized
congressional
authority
to
come
in
and
ask
for
this
injunction
as
it
is
to
say
section
2038
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
the
same
thing
attached
to
it.
and
we
also
know
that
--
for
example,
when
this
court
decided
the
rachel
case.
they
decided
it's
of
title
2
of
the
public
accommodations.
they
gave
an
actual
thrust,
in
other
words,
the
positive
requirement
that
there
have
been
injunction
sought
or
there
be
relief
sought,
this
authorized
removal.
well,
here
this
court
by
turning
down
certiorari
in
the
hamer
versus
campell
case
where
there
was
an
injunction
sought
and
overturning
of
election,
here
was
a
private
citizen
coming
in
under
1983
and
other
related
statutes,
attempting
to
exert
a
right
and
here,
you
didn't
hold
that
2283
was
a
ban.
2283
cannot
be
a
ban
in
this
case.
if
2283
comes
into
play,
it
cannot
come
into
play
in
this
situation
simply
because
if
the
criteria
set
forth
in
dombrowski
are
met,
well
then
this
isn't
expressly
an
authorized
exception
to
the
case.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
case
for
example
in
potter
versus
dixon,
in
rachel
and
in
us
versus
woods
and
all
those
cases
we're
citing
in
the
brief,
the
court
has
every
time
made
an
exception
and
said
this
is
an
expressly
authorized
exception
to
2283.
you
can
come
in
and
file
these
injunction
proceedings.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
that's
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
here.
the
other
--
my
opponent,
mr.
wells
in
his
brief
talks
about
the
baines
case
being
a
bar
and
that's
baines
versus
city
of
danville,
but
when
that
case
was
decided,
this
court
had
not
come
down
with
a
dombrowski
hearing
yet
and
was
pretty
clear
that
the
same
judge
who
wrote
the
baines
opinion,
later
on
came
out
and
talked
in
terms
of
dombrowski
which
was
now
then
available
to
him
in
the
case
of
unites
steel
workers
of
america
versus
bagwell
which
is
383
federal
reporter
2nd
the
september
1967
case
in
which
he
says
on
page
495
the
abstention
doctrine
warrants
refusal
to
exercise
properly
invoked
federal
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
statute's
applicability
to
the
challenger
or
to
his
conduct
and
when
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state
courts
may
remove
the
constitutional
issue
from
the
case.
when
however
the
statute
is
obviously
applicable
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
course
of
conduct
that
when
the
statute
is
not
susceptible
to
a
construction
that
will
otherwise
avoid
the
necessity
of
deciding
the
constitutional
question,
a
federal
court
may
not
properly
state
its
hand.
so
really
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
we're
not
so
much
in
exception,
expressly
authorized
by
the
congress
but
where
you
have
the
federally
given
rights
as
you
do
in
section
1983
of
title
42,
you
have
a
positive
federal
burden
and
duty
to
step
in
and
issue
the
injunction
to
protect
the
issuance
of
--
to
protect
those
rights
so
that
1983
is
not
a
bar.
it
is
a
positive
statement
under
the
theory
of
comity
that
there
has
to
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
either
the
federal
government
or
the
individual
litigant
to
go
forward
and
issue
the
injunction
or
to
hold
the
hearing
and
see
if
the
injunction
should
issue.
this
was
made
all
the
more
clear
when
this
court
decided
the
peacock
case
because
when
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
decision
in
peacock
in
a
portion
of
the
opinion
as
this
court
well
knows,
denying
the
right
of
removal
in
that
case,
he
said
in
effect
and
i
don't
need
to
quote
it,
that
there
should
be
--
there
will
be
other
remedies
available
and
one
of
these
other
remedies
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
peacock
opinion
was
the
remedy
of
injunction.
now,
this
is
the
remedy
we're
seeking
here.
i
say
to
you
gentlemen
here
now,
we've
lost
the
removal
in
peacock.
we
can
no
longer
--
the
situation
in
the
south
is
still
bad.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
in
voting
situations,
there
is
still
violence
going
on.
there
are
shootings
going
on,
and
we
know
that
there
were
some
last
night
in
front
of
(inaudible)
house
down
there
in
mississippi
a
shotgun
went
off.
we
still
have
a
voting
problem
down
there.
i
don't
care
how
many
acts
you're
going
to
pass,
you're
still
are
going
to
have
this
problem
and
we
still
need
some
protection.
we
didn't
get
it
in
peacock
but
we're
back
now
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel.
if
we
don't
get
it
with
the
injunction
procedure,
we're
going
to
be
in
serious
trouble
down
there.
what
you're
saying
--
alright,
i
can
understand
how
you
would
feel
about
removal
when
a
lawyer
can
come
in
and
simply
file
a
removal
petition
and
he
ties
up
the
docket
of
the
federal
court,
the
court
has
to
hold
a
hearing.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
about
that
when
we
argued
peacock
about
the
problems
involved.
but
here,
you
have
a
more
precise
remedy
available
to
you.
you
have
an
injunction
proceeding
which
is
a
more
delicate
remedy.
it's
one
that
will
only
tie
up
the
federal
courts
and
their
dockets
if
the
judge,
after
hearing
or
looking
at
the
case
feels
that
he's
got
something
that
ought
to
be
looked
into.
does
it
meet
the
dombrowski
criteria?
the
whole
situation
would
be
--
i
think
would
resolve
itself
differently.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
factual
issues
would
be
relevant.
i
don't
think
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
would
be
the
relevant
issue,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
first
of
all,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
would
be
an
important
threshold
question.
secondly,
i
think
that
we
find
that
--
i
think
even
in
the
per
curiam
remand
dissent
that
mr.
justice
black
wrote
in
this
case,
he
said
that
if
it
was
a
valid
statute
and
it
was
being
enforced
to
harass
somebody,
well
then
that
would
be
a
proper
fit
--
subject
for
the
hearing,
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
surely.
i
think
you
use
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
--
i
think
you'd
use
the
whole
question
of
selective
enforcement,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
that
would
be
involved
in
it,
just
as
it
was
in
dombrowski.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
that's
what's
the
situation
is.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
that's
--
if
you
look
at
the
record,
that's
about
what
we
did
--
what
we
did
here.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
that
would
--
that
would
be
part
of
it.
i
think
i
said
in
the
removal
petition
that
i
draft
--
i
mean
the
injunction
that
i
drafted,
i
think
i
did
put
in
there,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
they
were
not
guilty
of
what
they
were
charged.
but
the
question
i
think
basically
on
the
hearing
would
be
whether
the
statute
was
being
used
to
harass
this
civil
rights
work
because
that's
fundamentally
the
basic
question
and
it
becomes
a
lot
easier
to
determine
where
there
is
harassment
if
one
goes
into
the
statute
itself.
i
think
mr.
kinoy
is
going
to
develop
that,
but
you
can
see
if
you
have
an
invalid
statute
how
funny
it
looks
to
try
to
enforce
it
many
times
and
i
think
that
shows
up
in
this
record,
too.
so
that
when
you
have
these
criteria
here,
i
think
you
got
such
a
very
strong
thrust
behind
the
whole
question
of
federal
rights,
that
this
question
2283
just
passes
right
out
the
window.
and
really,
if
you
read
judge
rives'
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
hearing,
that
is
the
one
in
1965
which
came
down
to
1966,
you'll
see
that
that's
really
--
he
says
the
threshold
question
merges
into
the
large
question
immediately.
he
says
if
you
have
alleged
and
can
show
the
dombrowksi
type
criteria,
he
thinks
the
foundation
for
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
is
there
and
the
exception
under
2283
is
already
brought
into
existence
so
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
cooper?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
cuder,
oh
yes,
that
was
the
one
i
was
reading
here.
i
would
say
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
as
effective
in
holding
--
in
stopping
the
prosecutions,
which
is
what
we're
looking
at
here,
i
would
think.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
of
course
i
guess
we're
there
because
after
the
original
petition
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right,
right,
i
agree.
i'm
just
simply
saying
when
i
drafted
my
original
papers
in
the
three-judge
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
made
it
a
petition
for
an
injunction
and
a
class
action
followed
by
amendment.
i
didn't
ask
as
i
recall
--
now
i'm
looking
at
the
pleadings
in
this
regard,
i
don't
believe
i
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
i
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
prosecution
that
of
course
i
later
removed
them
in
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
it
might
be
of
service
to
me.
i
don't
know
that
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
yes.
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
would
be.
i
guess
the
effect
would
naturally
be
to
stop
the
prosecutions
because
they
wouldn't
have
a
statute
under
which
they
could
prosecute.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
would
be
alright.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no.
i
guess
what
happened
in
jeanette
was
in
effect
of
the
injunction.
since
it
happened
the
same
day,
really
it
wouldn't
have
to
happen
at
the
same
day.
but
no,
i
hadn't
thought
about
it
in
those
--
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
can
see
where
it
would
a
declaratory
judgment,
particularly
where
you
have
a
statute
that
is
facially
unconstitutional
as
we've
alleged
in
this
case.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that's
going
to
be
facially
correct,
but
is
being
utilized
in
another
fashion
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
we
went
both
routes.
we
went
both
routes
on
it.
and
--
well
actually,
the
american
law
institute
has
addressed
itself
to
this
whole
question,
in
their
tentative
draft
number
five
which
they
considered
last
may.
they
talked
in
terms
of
what
changes
were
brought
in
this
section,
in
the
area
of
the
law
by
the
peacock
decision,
and
rachel
as
well,
and
they
were
the
ones
that
came
up
in
their
commentary
on
pages
112
and
113
that
talk
about
the
whole
business
of
strengthening
the
government's
or
the
person's
or
the
individual
litigant's
right
to
bring
the
injunction
and
the
whole
idea
that
2283
is
not
a
bar
to
the
bringing
of
the
injunction.
i
would
think,
your
honors,
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
facts
are
going
to
show
that
the
criteria
set
forth
in
the
opinion
written
by
you,
mr.
justice
brennan,
are
met
and
when
they're
met,
then
there
should
be
an
injunction
issue.
the
whole
question
or
the
issue
of
the
injunction
should
then
come
up.
it
should
not
bar
the
courts
to
these
injunctions.
if
we
don't
have
the
injunction,
the
only
thing
left
for
us
is
habeas.
we've
lost
in
--
with
removal.
we've
got
to
some
way
protect
these
federally
constitutional,
federally
protected,
federally
defined
rights.
and
injunction,
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
guess
along
with
the
discussion
of
the
panel
on
declaratory
judgment
is
just
about
all
that's
left
in
many
of
these
situations
and
i
thank
you
gentlemen.
