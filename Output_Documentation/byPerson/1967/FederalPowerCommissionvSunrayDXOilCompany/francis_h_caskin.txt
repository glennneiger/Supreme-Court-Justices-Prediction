mr.
francis
h.
caskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
on
behalf
of
12
of
the
producing
companies
who
were
respondents
in
the
cases
coming
here
from
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
amerada
cases,
i
will
discuss
the
retroactive
refund
issue.
the
tenth
circuit
is
held
but
the
commission
lack
the
power
to
impose
refund
liabilities
upon
amounts
previously
collected
on
the
temporary
certificates
which
contained
no
full
wanting
that
refunds
would
be
imposed.
as
its
opinion
makes
clear,
the
tenth
circuit
carefully
considered
the
circumstances
in
which
these
certificates
were
issued
as
well
as
the
terms
of
the
certificates
themselves.
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
make
clear
that
the
producers
recognized
that
the
commission
may
impose
reasonable
conditions
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
the
temporary
certificates.
and
this
court
in
hunt
in
--
at
376
u.s.
has
recognized
that
this
power
at
that
time
is
broad.
the
commission
often
exercises
its
conditioning
power
when
it
issues
temporary
certificates.
it
sometimes
reduces
the
initial
price
proposed.
it
sometimes
imposes
expressed
refund
conditions.
consequently,
the
absence
of
an
express
condition
that
temporary
certificate
was
highly
significant.
in
this
case
itself,
the
commission
exercised
its
conditioning
power
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
certificates.
in
one
instance,
it
lowered
the
price
proposed.
in
several
other
instances,
it
imposed
the
expressed
refund
conditions.
this
case,
however,
presents
to
the
court
for
the
first
time,
whether
the
commission
is
empowered
to
modify
the
terms
of
lawful
temporary
certificate
orders,
issued
without
refund
condition
by
imposing
refund
conditions
at
a
later
point
in
time
when
a
retroactive
basis
long
after
the
producer
has
irrevocably
dedicated
his
gas
to
the
interstate
market.
a
temporary
certificate
orders
in
this
case
not
only
lack
their
refund
condition.
indeed
the
commission
affirmatively
stated
that
the
prices
authorized
were
firm
prices
subject
only
to
prospective
modification
at
the
time
of
permanent
certification.
now,
the
temporary
certificates
in
question
must
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
commission
statement
of
general
policy
no.
61-1.
this
became
effective
on
september
28,
1960.
it
established
great
standards
for
various
producing
areas
in
the
united
states,
and
in
particular
established
price
ceilings
at
or
below
which
the
commission
would
issue
temporary
certificates
or
permanent
certificates
in
the
absence
of
innovation
without
a
price
condition.
these
price
ceilings
as
evidenced
by
the
commission's
policy
statement
were
based
upon
comprehensive
data
and
made
available
to
the
commission
as
a
result
of
six
years
of
producer
regulation.
in
its
1963
phillip's
decision
at
373
u.s.,
this
court
gave
recognition
to
the
significant
role
which
the
policy
statement
ceilings
had
had
in
maintaining
and
in
some
instances,
reducing
the
upward
trend
of
producer
prices.
but
what
i
mean,
they
either
maintain
the
level
or
reduce
them.
and
the
commission
itself
wanted
to
--
wanted
to
establish
this
policy
statement
prices
found
that
the
prices
would
promote
effective
producer
regulation
and
i
quote,
“in
a
manner
fit
to
all
with
these
interests
are
affected
by
commission
regulation.”
there
has
been
some
contentions
here
that
the
policy
statements
--
the
policy
statement
prices
were
pulled
out
to
fit
in.
one
only
has
to
read
the
commission's
policy
statement
to
see
the
comprehensive
support
that
it
marshaled
for
those
prices.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
in
some
cases,
it
did,
your
honor.
it
gathered
out
many
of
the
individual
cost
cases
that
had
been
instituted
by
the
commission
against
producers
following
this
court's
phillips
decision
in
1954.
it
also
had
previously
issued
permanent
certificates
in
these
various
areas.
it
looked
to
that.
i
must
say
that
we
were
stymied
in
this
case.
we
attempted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
but
we
were
excluded
from
testing
the
basis.
however,
the
commission
by
its
own
words,
use
the
very
comprehensive
support
for
these
policy
statement
pricing.
i
should
also
point
out
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
i
think
the
consumers
were
clearly
given
a
notice
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
because
the
commission
here
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
the
commission
said
that
they
were
establishing
these
prices
as
the
guide
for
initial
action
by
it.
and
as
mr.
schiff
said
yesterday,
this
would
be
reflected
in
temporary
certificates.
now,
this
was
a
fully
published
statement
and
in
the
federal
register,
and
i
believe
that
the
producers,
i
mean
the
distributors
will
put
on
clear
notice
that
the
commission
would
implement
its
policy
statement
by
the
issuance
of
temporary
certificate.
and
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
temporary
certificate
always
is
judicially
reviewable.
now
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
they
are
judicially
reviewable?
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
it
is
contested,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
mr.
coleman
has
suggested
that
this
is
a
right
without
a
remedy
but
what
he
does
is
rely
on
district
of
columbia
circuits
mcdermott
case
which
i
think
really
took
a
very
limited
view
to
the
scope
of
review
of
temporary
certificates.
and
by
comparison,
i
would
point
to
the
seventh
circuit's
review
of
temporary
cer
--
temporary
certificates
in
the
pure
case
of
292
f.
2d,
and
the
tenth
circuit's
review
of
temporary
certificates
in
the
sohio
case
at
298
f.
2d.
and
there
the
court
really
went
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
temporary
certificates
based
upon
the
policy
statement,
that
is
conditioned
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
were
problem
in
the
sense
or
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
statement
reflected
the
in-line
price
in
the
particular
area
and
in
those
--
in
both
of
those
cases
the
courts
found
that
the
policy
statement
level
was
actually
lower
than
the
in-line
price.
that
it
has
been
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
the
act
provides
that
they
would
be
--
they
are
not
issued
without
notice
of
hearing.
the
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
as
mr.
schiff
indicated
yesterday
and
i
think
the
distributors
have
from
time
to
time
considered
this.
the
commission
indicated
that
they
would
use
these
policy
statements
as
the
basis
for
initial
action
in
the
issuance
of
temporary
certificates.
they
didn't
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
that
was
very
clear.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
distributors
who
are
on
a
highly
sophisticated
group
were
clearly
unnoticed
that
this
was
going
to
be
implemented.
the
only
question
then
becomes
as
to
the
scope
of
the
review
of
the
temporary
certificates
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
think
the
commission
could
have
--
they
could
have
asked
for
different
procedures
to
be
followed.
but
i
think
that
the
act
itself
was
a
guide
to
the
commission
that
these
temporary
certificates
which
will
meet
emerging
situations
and
it
was
necessary
that
as
a
consequence,
they'd
be
passed
upon
without
notice
of
hearing.
but
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
commission's
action
was
immaturely
considered
action.
and
i
believe
that
the
distributor's
rights
to
whatever
redress
they
thought
they
should
have
could
have
been
fully
protected
on
judicial
review
especially
after
the
commission's
issuance
of
its
february
5th
order
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
explain
the
sequence
in
which
these
sales
or
the
sequence
in
which
these
temporary
certificates
were
issued,
the
commission
issued
its
policy
statement.
in
district
4
which
is
the
area
in
question,
where
the
refund
issue
is,
the
commission
established
a
maximum
price
of
18
cents.
now,
each
of
the
contracts
were
executed
subsequent
to
the
policy
statement
and
accepted
one
instance,
they
were
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level.
they
range
from
15.9
cents
to
18
cents.
most
of
them
were
in
the
area
of
17
cents.
now,
during
the
hearing,
the
producers
attempted
to
show
the
extent
of
their
reliance
upon
this
policy
statement.
some
of
the
producers
testified
that
they
had
ceased
negotiations
for
a
higher
price
in
reliance
upon
what
the
commission
had
said
that
is
unconditional
certification
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level.
other
producers
even
made
clear
that
they
had
given
up
specific
intrastate
market
so
we're
alternatively
available
doing
in
reliance
upon
unconditional
certificates.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
by
the
commission
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
it
does,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
those
words
cannot
be
read
literally
in
line
of
what
the
commission
has
said
this
to
the
meeting.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
confess
that.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
believe
that
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
every
temporary
certificate
ever
issued
by
the
commission
contains
that
language.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
it
must
be
read
on
the
context
of
what
the
commission
has
said
since
1955
on.
mr.
coleman
deprecated
our
citation
of
the
signal
case.
i
think
any
reading
of
it,
it
appears
at
238
f.2d
will
show
that
the
commission
has
not
interpreted
until
this
case
that
without
prejudice
language
in
the
temporary
certificate
is
a
refund
condition.
and
the
february
5th
order
itself,
shows
that
the
commission
did
not
intend
it
as
a
refund
condition
because
as
i
say,
should
the
temporary
certificates
contained
that
without
prejudice
language.
i
believe,
however,
that
the
february
5th
order
is
important
in
more
than
that
respect.
i
mean,
not
only
does
it
make
clear
that
the
prices
authorized
on
the
temporary
certificate
were
firm
prices
subject
to
modification
at
the
time
of
the
permanent
certificate.
but
it
also
articulates
a
well-considered
commission
policy
to
grant
temporary
certificates
at
firm
prices
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
while
proscribing
price
increases
during
the
period
of
temporary
certification.
now,
the
february
5th
order
which
appears
in
volume
1
at
page
155,
and
particularly,
at
page
158,
the
commission
says
as
to
such
temporary
authorizations
under
those
conditions,
it's
about
--
about
fourth
line
down,
“we
have
balanced
the
competing
interest
of
producers
and
consumers
as
well
as
given
full
consideration
to
the
needs
for
certainty
of
the
natural
gas
companies
and
the
public
general
by
providing
that
while
temporarily
certificated
price
is
not
subject
to
refund,
the
period,
the
price
during
this
interim
period
cannot
exceed
our
ceiling
price.”
now,
this
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
was
a
policy
not
limited
to
this
case.
it
was
industry-wide
scope.
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commission,
i
want
to
establish
initially
that
this
policy
was
in
effect
retroactively
changed
by
the
commission.
and
we
believe
that
your
decision
in
the
american
tracking
association
case
at
358
u.s.
condemns
this
action.
the
court
while
recognizing
that
an
agency
may
rectify
inadvertent
errors
in
prior
decisions
observed
that
an
agency
cannot
make
such
retroactive
changes
merely
to
establish
a
new
policy
on
a
retroactive
basis.
now,
mr.
coleman
contends
that
this
policy
never
existed.
that
is
of
issuing
temporary
certificates
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
or
proscribing
price
increases
during
the
temporary
certification
period.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
schiff
represents
the
commission
here
never
denied
that.
all
that
mr.
coleman
could
muster
for
his
support
was
an
order
in
catco
on
remand
issued
in
january
'62.
but
as
this
order
makes
clear
and
i'm
afraid
it
must
be
read
quite
clearly
because
the
commission
really
mischaracterized
what
it
was
doing
there
but
what
it
was
doing
there
was
imposing
refund
liabilities
upon
temporary
certifi
--
a
temporary
certificate
which
contained
an
expressed
refund
condition.
and
we
do
not
contest
that
in
that
situation,
the
power
to
order
refunds
exist.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
not
entirely,
your
honor.
we're
also
saying
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
contest
their
power
to
change
a
rate
that
has
been
filed
and
accepted
without
refund.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
would
have
to
concede
that
they
can
change
it
prospectively.
and
this
is
what
explicitly
they
refuse
to
do
in
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
that
they
were
not
bound
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
is
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
sir,
and
it
--
it
ties
in
with
the
other
aspect
of
the
question
that
not
only
was
this
a
well-articulated
commission
policy
that
produce
these
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
but
the
distributors
themselves
had
the
opportunity
to
contest
it.
and
as
i
say,
their
idea
of
what
the
scope
of
review
of
a
temporary
certificate
order
is
--
is
--
is
limited
in
my
judgment.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
they
cite
the
mcdermott
case
in
32
--
at
327
f.2d,
they
failed
to
recognize
that
there
was
not
a
question
there
before
the
court
of
a
determination
by
the
commission,
that
a
temporary
certificate
was
explicitly
not
subject
to
refund.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
the
producers
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
do
it
except
prospectively.
i
think
that
we
certainly
as
producers
could
come
in
and
seek
prospective
relief
but
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
relief
from
and
after
the
day
that
the
commission
acted.
i
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
commission
lacks
a
reparation
power.
and
that
under
section
5
of
the
act,
its
action
would
be
prospective
only
so
that
--
but
we
have
of
course
raised
a
--
such
questions.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
what
we
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
would
say
that
it
was
fixed
until
from
the
point
of
view
that
producers,
we
sought
relief
from
confiscation
if
that
was
a
question,
and
that
the
action
on
a
requested
relief
would
be
of
prospective
effect.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
this
requires
going
into
the
voice
of
the
commission
and
i
really
couldn't
say
except
that
they
were
exercising
their
discretionary
authority
to
attach
conditions
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
the
temporary
certificates.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
always
that,
peculiar
circumstances
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
and
there
is
one
temporary
certificate
in
this
case
where
the
refund
condition
was
imposed
with
a
floor
of
12
cents
which
obviously
related
to
the
fact
that
the
producer
was
acquiring
the
properties
from
someone
else.
i
think
what
the
commission
was
saying
very
clearly
was,
that
in
the
case
of
new
certificate
applications
controlling
contracts
or
governing
contracts
under
certif
--
under
con
--
governing
contracts
issued
after
the
policy
statement.
they
would
permit
unconditional
certification
without
refund
condition
provided
that
the
producer
was
proscribed
from
filing
price
increases
during
the
period
of
temporary
certification.
now
i
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
yes
sir.
they
said
that
in
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes.
they
said
that
at
page
158
of
volume
1
of
the
record.
now,
the
commission
presently
takes
the
position
that
its
february
5th
order
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
what
it
says
is
that
the
february
5th
order
was
a
refusal
to
imposed
and
expressed
refund
condition.
the
implication
being
that
there
was
already
an
implicit
refund
condition.
but
this
is
truly
incomprehensible
in
light
with
the
plain
words
of
the
february
5th
order,
itself.
and
it
only
shows
to
me
that
it's
a
form
of
post
hoc
rationalization
to
cover
a
change
in
policy
applied
retroactively.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
the
february
5th
order?
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
sir.
it
appears
that
page
155
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix.
and
it
goes
on
to
several
pages
mr.
justice.
now,
as
a
part
of
its
argument,
the
temporary
certificates
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
they
have
to
approve
the
price
at
--
at
least
a
certain
price.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
they
thought
they
had
the
power.
i
believe
they
have
the
power.
and
the
distributors
were
unnoticed.
and
if
they
want
to
assert
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
the
power
to
issue
temporary
certificate
what
are
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
do
they
have
the
power
to
--
i
say
not
unless
they
put
a
floor
in
it.
they
often
issue
temporary
certificates
for
the
refund
conditions
based
upon
an
explicit
price
floor.
and
this
is
in
clear
accord
with
what
they
have
done
since
1959
following
the
tenth
circuit
sunray
mid-continent
decision
in
270
f.2d.
so
i
say
they
have
the
power
to
issue
a
temporary
certificate
without
approving
the
total
price
but
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
merely
hold
in
advance
what
the
price
maybe
contingent
upon
permanent
certification.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
this
was
the
first
case
that
they've
done
it
in.
this
is
the
first
time
that
they
have
success
--
not
successfully,
but
have
attempted
to
read
without
prejudice
language
as
an
absolute
lack
of
approval
of
the
rate
accepted
for
filing
of
the
temporary
certification
period.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
did.
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
said
they
did
witness
the
february
5th
order.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
cover
one
question
finally
because
it's
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
the
refund
power
which
we
of
course,
concede
or
refuse
to
concede
exist,
i
urge
that
the
court,
the
further
view
of
that
question
at
this
time.
when
the
commission
actually
imposed
the
refund
liabilities
by
its
opinion
501,
the
threshold
question
of
whether
it
possessed
the
power
was
then
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit.
and
by
the
time
that
the
11
petitions
to
review
opinion
501
were
before
the
tenth
circuit,
that
court
decided
in
sunray
dx
that
the
commission
lacked
power.
and
based
upon
a
motion
for
summary
disposition
of
the
second
series
of
appeals,
the
tenth
circuit
set
aside
opinion
501
in
light
of
its
sunray
dx
case.
i
wish
to
note
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
nothing
before
except
a
mere
listing
of
the
record
and
the
allegations
concerning
the
exercise
of
the
power
had
not
even
been
briefed.
and
for
this
reason,
among
others,
as
stated
in
our
briefs,
particularly
our
reply
brief,
i
would
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
let
the
tenth
circuit
decide
this
exercise
of
the
power
questions
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
on
behalf
of
12
of
the
producing
companies
who
were
respondents
in
the
cases
coming
here
from
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
amerada
cases,
i
will
discuss
the
retroactive
refund
issue.
the
tenth
circuit
is
held
but
the
commission
lack
the
power
to
impose
refund
liabilities
upon
amounts
previously
collected
on
the
temporary
certificates
which
contained
no
full
wanting
that
refunds
would
be
imposed.
as
its
opinion
makes
clear,
the
tenth
circuit
carefully
considered
the
circumstances
in
which
these
certificates
were
issued
as
well
as
the
terms
of
the
certificates
themselves.
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
make
clear
that
the
producers
recognized
that
the
commission
may
impose
reasonable
conditions
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
the
temporary
certificates.
and
this
court
in
hunt
in
--
at
376
u.s.
has
recognized
that
this
power
at
that
time
is
broad.
the
commission
often
exercises
its
conditioning
power
when
it
issues
temporary
certificates.
it
sometimes
reduces
the
initial
price
proposed.
it
sometimes
imposes
expressed
refund
conditions.
consequently,
the
absence
of
an
express
condition
that
temporary
certificate
was
highly
significant.
in
this
case
itself,
the
commission
exercised
its
conditioning
power
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
certificates.
in
one
instance,
it
lowered
the
price
proposed.
in
several
other
instances,
it
imposed
the
expressed
refund
conditions.
this
case,
however,
presents
to
the
court
for
the
first
time,
whether
the
commission
is
empowered
to
modify
the
terms
of
lawful
temporary
certificate
orders,
issued
without
refund
condition
by
imposing
refund
conditions
at
a
later
point
in
time
when
a
retroactive
basis
long
after
the
producer
has
irrevocably
dedicated
his
gas
to
the
interstate
market.
a
temporary
certificate
orders
in
this
case
not
only
lack
their
refund
condition.
indeed
the
commission
affirmatively
stated
that
the
prices
authorized
were
firm
prices
subject
only
to
prospective
modification
at
the
time
of
permanent
certification.
now,
the
temporary
certificates
in
question
must
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
commission
statement
of
general
policy
no.
61-1.
this
became
effective
on
september
28,
1960.
it
established
great
standards
for
various
producing
areas
in
the
united
states,
and
in
particular
established
price
ceilings
at
or
below
which
the
commission
would
issue
temporary
certificates
or
permanent
certificates
in
the
absence
of
innovation
without
a
price
condition.
these
price
ceilings
as
evidenced
by
the
commission's
policy
statement
were
based
upon
comprehensive
data
and
made
available
to
the
commission
as
a
result
of
six
years
of
producer
regulation.
in
its
1963
phillip's
decision
at
373
u.s.,
this
court
gave
recognition
to
the
significant
role
which
the
policy
statement
ceilings
had
had
in
maintaining
and
in
some
instances,
reducing
the
upward
trend
of
producer
prices.
but
what
i
mean,
they
either
maintain
the
level
or
reduce
them.
and
the
commission
itself
wanted
to
--
wanted
to
establish
this
policy
statement
prices
found
that
the
prices
would
promote
effective
producer
regulation
and
i
quote,
“in
a
manner
fit
to
all
with
these
interests
are
affected
by
commission
regulation.”
there
has
been
some
contentions
here
that
the
policy
statements
--
the
policy
statement
prices
were
pulled
out
to
fit
in.
one
only
has
to
read
the
commission's
policy
statement
to
see
the
comprehensive
support
that
it
marshaled
for
those
prices.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
in
some
cases,
it
did,
your
honor.
it
gathered
out
many
of
the
individual
cost
cases
that
had
been
instituted
by
the
commission
against
producers
following
this
court's
phillips
decision
in
1954.
it
also
had
previously
issued
permanent
certificates
in
these
various
areas.
it
looked
to
that.
i
must
say
that
we
were
stymied
in
this
case.
we
attempted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
but
we
were
excluded
from
testing
the
basis.
however,
the
commission
by
its
own
words,
use
the
very
comprehensive
support
for
these
policy
statement
pricing.
i
should
also
point
out
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
i
think
the
consumers
were
clearly
given
a
notice
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
because
the
commission
here
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
the
commission
said
that
they
were
establishing
these
prices
as
the
guide
for
initial
action
by
it.
and
as
mr.
schiff
said
yesterday,
this
would
be
reflected
in
temporary
certificates.
now,
this
was
a
fully
published
statement
and
in
the
federal
register,
and
i
believe
that
the
producers,
i
mean
the
distributors
will
put
on
clear
notice
that
the
commission
would
implement
its
policy
statement
by
the
issuance
of
temporary
certificate.
and
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
temporary
certificate
always
is
judicially
reviewable.
now
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
they
are
judicially
reviewable?
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
it
is
contested,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
mr.
coleman
has
suggested
that
this
is
a
right
without
a
remedy
but
what
he
does
is
rely
on
district
of
columbia
circuits
mcdermott
case
which
i
think
really
took
a
very
limited
view
to
the
scope
of
review
of
temporary
certificates.
and
by
comparison,
i
would
point
to
the
seventh
circuit's
review
of
temporary
cer
--
temporary
certificates
in
the
pure
case
of
292
f.
2d,
and
the
tenth
circuit's
review
of
temporary
certificates
in
the
sohio
case
at
298
f.
2d.
and
there
the
court
really
went
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
temporary
certificates
based
upon
the
policy
statement,
that
is
conditioned
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
were
problem
in
the
sense
or
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
statement
reflected
the
in-line
price
in
the
particular
area
and
in
those
--
in
both
of
those
cases
the
courts
found
that
the
policy
statement
level
was
actually
lower
than
the
in-line
price.
that
it
has
been
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
the
act
provides
that
they
would
be
--
they
are
not
issued
without
notice
of
hearing.
the
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
as
mr.
schiff
indicated
yesterday
and
i
think
the
distributors
have
from
time
to
time
considered
this.
the
commission
indicated
that
they
would
use
these
policy
statements
as
the
basis
for
initial
action
in
the
issuance
of
temporary
certificates.
they
didn't
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
that
was
very
clear.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
distributors
who
are
on
a
highly
sophisticated
group
were
clearly
unnoticed
that
this
was
going
to
be
implemented.
the
only
question
then
becomes
as
to
the
scope
of
the
review
of
the
temporary
certificates
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
think
the
commission
could
have
--
they
could
have
asked
for
different
procedures
to
be
followed.
but
i
think
that
the
act
itself
was
a
guide
to
the
commission
that
these
temporary
certificates
which
will
meet
emerging
situations
and
it
was
necessary
that
as
a
consequence,
they'd
be
passed
upon
without
notice
of
hearing.
but
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
commission's
action
was
immaturely
considered
action.
and
i
believe
that
the
distributor's
rights
to
whatever
redress
they
thought
they
should
have
could
have
been
fully
protected
on
judicial
review
especially
after
the
commission's
issuance
of
its
february
5th
order
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
explain
the
sequence
in
which
these
sales
or
the
sequence
in
which
these
temporary
certificates
were
issued,
the
commission
issued
its
policy
statement.
in
district
4
which
is
the
area
in
question,
where
the
refund
issue
is,
the
commission
established
a
maximum
price
of
18
cents.
now,
each
of
the
contracts
were
executed
subsequent
to
the
policy
statement
and
accepted
one
instance,
they
were
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level.
they
range
from
15.9
cents
to
18
cents.
most
of
them
were
in
the
area
of
17
cents.
now,
during
the
hearing,
the
producers
attempted
to
show
the
extent
of
their
reliance
upon
this
policy
statement.
some
of
the
producers
testified
that
they
had
ceased
negotiations
for
a
higher
price
in
reliance
upon
what
the
commission
had
said
that
is
unconditional
certification
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level.
other
producers
even
made
clear
that
they
had
given
up
specific
intrastate
market
so
we're
alternatively
available
doing
in
reliance
upon
unconditional
certificates.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
by
the
commission
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
it
does,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
those
words
cannot
be
read
literally
in
line
of
what
the
commission
has
said
this
to
the
meeting.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
confess
that.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
believe
that
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
every
temporary
certificate
ever
issued
by
the
commission
contains
that
language.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
it
must
be
read
on
the
context
of
what
the
commission
has
said
since
1955
on.
mr.
coleman
deprecated
our
citation
of
the
signal
case.
i
think
any
reading
of
it,
it
appears
at
238
f.2d
will
show
that
the
commission
has
not
interpreted
until
this
case
that
without
prejudice
language
in
the
temporary
certificate
is
a
refund
condition.
and
the
february
5th
order
itself,
shows
that
the
commission
did
not
intend
it
as
a
refund
condition
because
as
i
say,
should
the
temporary
certificates
contained
that
without
prejudice
language.
i
believe,
however,
that
the
february
5th
order
is
important
in
more
than
that
respect.
i
mean,
not
only
does
it
make
clear
that
the
prices
authorized
on
the
temporary
certificate
were
firm
prices
subject
to
modification
at
the
time
of
the
permanent
certificate.
but
it
also
articulates
a
well-considered
commission
policy
to
grant
temporary
certificates
at
firm
prices
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
while
proscribing
price
increases
during
the
period
of
temporary
certification.
now,
the
february
5th
order
which
appears
in
volume
1
at
page
155,
and
particularly,
at
page
158,
the
commission
says
as
to
such
temporary
authorizations
under
those
conditions,
it's
about
--
about
fourth
line
down,
“we
have
balanced
the
competing
interest
of
producers
and
consumers
as
well
as
given
full
consideration
to
the
needs
for
certainty
of
the
natural
gas
companies
and
the
public
general
by
providing
that
while
temporarily
certificated
price
is
not
subject
to
refund,
the
period,
the
price
during
this
interim
period
cannot
exceed
our
ceiling
price.”
now,
this
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
was
a
policy
not
limited
to
this
case.
it
was
industry-wide
scope.
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commission,
i
want
to
establish
initially
that
this
policy
was
in
effect
retroactively
changed
by
the
commission.
and
we
believe
that
your
decision
in
the
american
tracking
association
case
at
358
u.s.
condemns
this
action.
the
court
while
recognizing
that
an
agency
may
rectify
inadvertent
errors
in
prior
decisions
observed
that
an
agency
cannot
make
such
retroactive
changes
merely
to
establish
a
new
policy
on
a
retroactive
basis.
now,
mr.
coleman
contends
that
this
policy
never
existed.
that
is
of
issuing
temporary
certificates
at
or
below
the
policy
statement
level
or
proscribing
price
increases
during
the
temporary
certification
period.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
schiff
represents
the
commission
here
never
denied
that.
all
that
mr.
coleman
could
muster
for
his
support
was
an
order
in
catco
on
remand
issued
in
january
'62.
but
as
this
order
makes
clear
and
i'm
afraid
it
must
be
read
quite
clearly
because
the
commission
really
mischaracterized
what
it
was
doing
there
but
what
it
was
doing
there
was
imposing
refund
liabilities
upon
temporary
certifi
--
a
temporary
certificate
which
contained
an
expressed
refund
condition.
and
we
do
not
contest
that
in
that
situation,
the
power
to
order
refunds
exist.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
not
entirely,
your
honor.
we're
also
saying
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
contest
their
power
to
change
a
rate
that
has
been
filed
and
accepted
without
refund.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
would
have
to
concede
that
they
can
change
it
prospectively.
and
this
is
what
explicitly
they
refuse
to
do
in
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
that
they
were
not
bound
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
is
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
sir,
and
it
--
it
ties
in
with
the
other
aspect
of
the
question
that
not
only
was
this
a
well-articulated
commission
policy
that
produce
these
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
but
the
distributors
themselves
had
the
opportunity
to
contest
it.
and
as
i
say,
their
idea
of
what
the
scope
of
review
of
a
temporary
certificate
order
is
--
is
--
is
limited
in
my
judgment.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
they
cite
the
mcdermott
case
in
32
--
at
327
f.2d,
they
failed
to
recognize
that
there
was
not
a
question
there
before
the
court
of
a
determination
by
the
commission,
that
a
temporary
certificate
was
explicitly
not
subject
to
refund.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that
the
producers
–-
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
do
it
except
prospectively.
i
think
that
we
certainly
as
producers
could
come
in
and
seek
prospective
relief
but
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
relief
from
and
after
the
day
that
the
commission
acted.
i
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
commission
lacks
a
reparation
power.
and
that
under
section
5
of
the
act,
its
action
would
be
prospective
only
so
that
--
but
we
have
of
course
raised
a
--
such
questions.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
what
we
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
i
would
say
that
it
was
fixed
until
from
the
point
of
view
that
producers,
we
sought
relief
from
confiscation
if
that
was
a
question,
and
that
the
action
on
a
requested
relief
would
be
of
prospective
effect.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
this
requires
going
into
the
voice
of
the
commission
and
i
really
couldn't
say
except
that
they
were
exercising
their
discretionary
authority
to
attach
conditions
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
the
temporary
certificates.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
always
that,
peculiar
circumstances
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
and
there
is
one
temporary
certificate
in
this
case
where
the
refund
condition
was
imposed
with
a
floor
of
12
cents
which
obviously
related
to
the
fact
that
the
producer
was
acquiring
the
properties
from
someone
else.
i
think
what
the
commission
was
saying
very
clearly
was,
that
in
the
case
of
new
certificate
applications
controlling
contracts
or
governing
contracts
under
certif
--
under
con
--
governing
contracts
issued
after
the
policy
statement.
they
would
permit
unconditional
certification
without
refund
condition
provided
that
the
producer
was
proscribed
from
filing
price
increases
during
the
period
of
temporary
certification.
now
i
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well
yes
sir.
they
said
that
in
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes.
they
said
that
at
page
158
of
volume
1
of
the
record.
now,
the
commission
presently
takes
the
position
that
its
february
5th
order
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
what
it
says
is
that
the
february
5th
order
was
a
refusal
to
imposed
and
expressed
refund
condition.
the
implication
being
that
there
was
already
an
implicit
refund
condition.
but
this
is
truly
incomprehensible
in
light
with
the
plain
words
of
the
february
5th
order,
itself.
and
it
only
shows
to
me
that
it's
a
form
of
post
hoc
rationalization
to
cover
a
change
in
policy
applied
retroactively.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
the
february
5th
order?
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes
sir.
it
appears
that
page
155
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix.
and
it
goes
on
to
several
pages
mr.
justice.
now,
as
a
part
of
its
argument,
the
temporary
certificates
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
they
have
to
approve
the
price
at
--
at
least
a
certain
price.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
they
thought
they
had
the
power.
i
believe
they
have
the
power.
and
the
distributors
were
unnoticed.
and
if
they
want
to
assert
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
the
power
to
issue
temporary
certificate
what
are
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
--
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
do
they
have
the
power
to
--
i
say
not
unless
they
put
a
floor
in
it.
they
often
issue
temporary
certificates
for
the
refund
conditions
based
upon
an
explicit
price
floor.
and
this
is
in
clear
accord
with
what
they
have
done
since
1959
following
the
tenth
circuit
sunray
mid-continent
decision
in
270
f.2d.
so
i
say
they
have
the
power
to
issue
a
temporary
certificate
without
approving
the
total
price
but
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
merely
hold
in
advance
what
the
price
maybe
contingent
upon
permanent
certification.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
well,
your
honor,
this
was
the
first
case
that
they've
done
it
in.
this
is
the
first
time
that
they
have
success
--
not
successfully,
but
have
attempted
to
read
without
prejudice
language
as
an
absolute
lack
of
approval
of
the
rate
accepted
for
filing
of
the
temporary
certification
period.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
caskin
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
did.
that's
what
i'm
saying
they
said
they
did
witness
the
february
5th
order.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
cover
one
question
finally
because
it's
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
the
refund
power
which
we
of
course,
concede
or
refuse
to
concede
exist,
i
urge
that
the
court,
the
further
view
of
that
question
at
this
time.
when
the
commission
actually
imposed
the
refund
liabilities
by
its
opinion
501,
the
threshold
question
of
whether
it
possessed
the
power
was
then
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit.
and
by
the
time
that
the
11
petitions
to
review
opinion
501
were
before
the
tenth
circuit,
that
court
decided
in
sunray
dx
that
the
commission
lacked
power.
and
based
upon
a
motion
for
summary
disposition
of
the
second
series
of
appeals,
the
tenth
circuit
set
aside
opinion
501
in
light
of
its
sunray
dx
case.
i
wish
to
note
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
nothing
before
except
a
mere
listing
of
the
record
and
the
allegations
concerning
the
exercise
of
the
power
had
not
even
been
briefed.
and
for
this
reason,
among
others,
as
stated
in
our
briefs,
particularly
our
reply
brief,
i
would
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
let
the
tenth
circuit
decide
this
exercise
of
the
power
questions
in
the
first
instance.
