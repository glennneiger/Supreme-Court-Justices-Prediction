mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
greene
johnson.
i
represent
shell
oil
company,
the
petitioner
in
case
number
111.
and
i
appear
here
also
on
behalf
of
humble
skelly
and
the
other
petitioners
in
case
number
143.
we
are
aligned
with
the
commission
on
two
of
the
three
issues
involved
here.
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
determined
in
railroad
districts
2
and
3,
and
the
texas
gulf
coast
area,
we
support
the
commission's
decision.
on
the
need
issue,
we
further
support
the
commission's
decision
that
the
proper
place
to
consider
this
issue
is
in
a
pipeline
certificate
proceeding
and
not
a
producer
certificate
proceeding.
both
of
these
decisions
by
the
commission
were
held
beyond
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
in-line
issue.
and
first
of
all,
i
would
like
the
court
to
direct
this
attention
to
the
role
of
the
distributor
interest
in
these
in-line
proceedings.
the
commission
has
discussed
at
great
length
the
commission's
procedure.
the
distributors
yesterday
pointed
out
the
efforts
that
producers
have
made
to
obtain
a
contract
prices.
i
would
request
to
the
court
now
direct
its
attention
to
the
role
of
the
distributors
in
these
cases.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
you,
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
mr.
coleman
yesterday.
the
first
of
which
was,
how
much
money
will
the
distributors
receive
in
refunds?
and
how
much
will
they
pass
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer?
in
this
connection,
mr.
coleman
had
pointed
out
that
pipelines
are
not
participants
in
these
proceedings.
we
disagree
with
mr.
coleman's
reason
for
that.
but
his
reason
was
that
the
rate
increases
can
be
passed
along
by
the
pipelines.
in
our
view,
the
real
reason
why
the
pipelines
are
not
here
is
because,
they
already
have
their
opportunity
when
they
negotiated
the
contracts
with
the
producers.
and
they
did
not
feel
on
the
position
to
attack
those
contracts
which
they
themselves
negotiated
before
the
commission.
to
be
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
rephrase
mr.
coleman's
question
and
ask
why
the
distributor
companies
are
always
such
active
partners
in
these
proceedings
before
the
commission
on
the
courts
and
if
as
they
contend,
they
are
simply
conduits
of
this
line.
and
it's
all
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
and
that
answer
is
that
the
distributor
company
to
do
retain
a
large
amount
of
the
refunds
which
will
be
ordered
in
this
case,
if
the
commission
is
sustained
and
larger
amounts
of
refunds,
if
the
distributor
position
is
sustained.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
record
shows
this.
the
commission
undertook
in
1962
and
1963
a
survey
that
the
distributor
companies.
and
they
asked
these
distributor
companies
how
much
refunds
they
were
passing
along.
this
evidence
was
compiled
by
a
producer
witness.
and
that
witness
testified
that
that
questionnaire
showed
that
42%
of
the
refunds
received
by
the
distributing
companies
during
the
period
covered
by
the
commission's
survey
which
was
about
--
well,
from
july
1961
and
november
1962,
during
that
period,
the
distributors
retained
42%
of
the
money
which
they
received.
those
moneys
amounted
according
to
the
commission's
record,
to
$51.9
million.
that
evidence
was
excluded
by
the
presiding
examiner
on
the
motion
of
distributing
companies.
so
therefore,
it
was
not
before
the
commission
and
unfortunately
we
have
not
included
there
in
the
joint
appendix
because
our
posture
here
is
to
support
the
commission's
decision.
nonetheless,
that
evidence
is
in
the
record
i
offered
proof.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
merely
–
i'm
raising
this
question
in
order
to
point
out
that
the
real
representative
of
the
consumer
in
these
proceedings
is
the
person
that's
the
--
or
the
part
that
the
statute
has
required
and
represented
themselves.
and
that's
the
federal
partnership.
it's
not
the
distributor
companies.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
alright
sir,
i
like
to
address
myself
to
that.
aside
from
the
motives
of
the
distributor
companies,
we
would
like
now
to
focus
on
their
objectives.
and
their
objective,
they
have
made
clear
at
various
points
in
their
briefs
but
they
do
not
emphasize
it
in
this
case.
that
objective
is
very
simple.
the
objective
is
to
freeze
the
price
line
at
the
levels
that
have
existed
from
1958
to
1960.
now,
for
some
mean,
by
some
means
known
only
to
the
distributor's
interest,
they
determine
that
this
line
should
be
frozen,
somewhere
in
the
area
between
14
and
15
cents.
they
then
embark
on
a
program
of
intervening
in
all
producer
certificate
cases
where
the
prices
exceeded
those
levels.
by
this
method
of
intervention,
they
were
able
to
and
by
prolonged
litigation
on
these
contract
prices
they
were
able
to
place
these
prices
in
a
suspect
category
over
a
long
period
of
time.
as
a
result,
the
commission
under
the
rules
announced
by
various
circuit
courts
did
not
consider
these
prices
when
it
originally
determined
the
line
in
these
areas.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
during
the
time
that
the
contracts
in
these
proceedings
were
made,
there
were
no
in-line
prices
in
these
areas
for
any
period.
these
contracts
were
made
in
the
time
period
from
september
28,
1960
to
about
the
end
of
1963.
the
in-line
prices
were
not
determined
by
the
commission
for
this
same
period.
for
amerada,
the
decision
came
out
in
august
of
1962.
for
the
hawkins
case,
the
decision
in
district
3
in
the
earlier
case
was
decided
in
march
27,
1963.
in
district
2,
the
decision
by
the
commission
covering
the
earlier
of
period
was
in
december
9,
1963.
in
all
of
the
amerada
sales
and
one
of
the
hawkins
sales
and
in
all
but
one
of
the
sinclair
sales,
there
was
no
in-line
price
determined
by
the
commission
at
the
time
these
sales
were
made.
yet
the
distributors
continued
to
intervene
in
these
cases
above
the
level
which
they
had
determined,
not
a
commission
determined
level.
all
the
industry
had
to
look
to
was
the
18
cent
guideline
level
which
the
commission
had
determined,
which
the
distributors
contend
cannot
be
utilized
in
this
case.
we
have
detailed
further
in
our
brief
the
methods
which
the
distributors
have
followed
in
attempting
to
exclude
all
of
the
evidences
which
the
commission
could
possibly
use
to
find
that
the
price
line
was
higher
for
the
1960s
than
it
was
in
the
1950s.
i
would
like
to
focus
now
on
the
question
which
mr.
justice
white
has
raised
last
night
and
again
this
morning
with
reference
to
the
relation
between
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
has
determined
here
in
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
i
believe
it
is
now
clear
that
the
in-line
price
is
the
level
to
which
refunds
will
be
ordered
in
this
case.
and
it
is
the
level
if
it's
too
high
that
is
if
it's
above
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
producers
can
retroactively
file
for
this
difference
correspondingly
if
in-line
price
is
below
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
there
is
no
way
that
refunds
can
be
required
for
this
difference.
so
really
in
our
view,
what
the
commission
was
attempting
to
do
here
and
they
used
the
terms
fair
and
reasonable.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
is
ultimately
correct
that
these
are
different
sections
of
the
statute.
but
at
least
in
the
commission's
consideration,
the
standards
which
they
use
i
think
are
very
closely
approached
each
other
to
the
extent
that
they
can
under
the
limited
consideration
which
the
commission
can
give
the
evidence
in
an
in-line
proceeding.
so
i
think
it's
material
here
to
at
least
consider
to
the
extent
that
we
can
whether
the
in-line
price
will
be
above
or
below
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
mr.
tell
mentioned
this
briefly
in
his
argument.
we
do
have
some
guidelines
on
this.
in
the
permian
case
which
was
argued
before
this
court
last
december,
one
of
the
findings
which
the
commission
made
in
that
case
was
the
national
cost
of
gas
for
1960.
now,
of
course,
the
national
cost
includes
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
here.
and
that
finding
was
16.43
cents
per
mcf
national
cost.
now,
in
the
permian
case
as
mr.
tell
pointed
out,
the
commission
had
previously
determined
an
in-line
price
for
that
area
of
the
16
cents.
in
their
price
for
new
gas,
in
the
permian
area,
they
determined
that
part
level
to
be
16
1/2
cents,
one
half
cent
above
the
in-line
price.
mr.
tell
has
pointed
out
that
the
record
is
now
closed
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
rate
proceeding.
and
that
the
commission
staff
has
recommended
a
price
for
new
gas
and
incidentally
new
gas
as
defined
by
the
commission
on
the
permian
case
and
by
the
commission
staff
in
this
case
as
involving
all
contracts
dated
after
january
1st,
1961.
now,
you
see
there's
only
three
months
or
two
months
difference
between
the
dividing
line
on
the
policy
statement,
the
definite
periods
selected
for
the
in-line
price,
and
the
dividing
line
between
new
and
old
gas
which
the
commission
has
found
different
rates
for
in
the
area
rate
proceedings.
the
commission
staff
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
rate
proceeding
for
gas
delivered
at
a
central
point
which
is
the
predominant
method
of
delivery
has
recommended
that
just
and
reasonable
rate
of
16.8
cents.
and
even
more
significantly
a
witness
for
the
same
--
some
of
the
same
distributor
companies
which
are
here
attacking
the
in-line
price
made
a
recommendation
for
texas
railroad
district
4
for
new
gas
of
16.25
cents,
for
railroad
district
2,
16.75
cents,
and
for
railroad
district
3,
17.25
cents.
now,
i
should
add
that
the
cut
off
date
which
the
distributors
recommend
is
january
1st,
1963
not
'61.
but
if
the
commission
follows
its
decision
in
the
permian
case
and
finds
to
cut
off
date
for
the
reasons
which
they
gave
in
that
case
to
the
january
1st,
1961.
even
under
the
distributor
recommendations,
the
in-line
price
will
be
below
with
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
filed.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
--
very
briefly
to
point
out
two
things
with
reference
to
the
use
of
temporary
certificates.
first
of
all,
the
deliveries
are
conducted
most
under
these
proceedings,
under
temporary
certificates,
because
of
interventions
which
the
distributor
companies
filed
which
force
contested
proceedings,
thus
required
a
very
lengthy
proceeding.
and
under
the
circumstances
there,
the
producers
there
had
no
alternative
but
to
apply
for
temporary
certificates
so
they
can
begin
delivering
their
gas.
secondly,
the
commission
did
not
give
as
i
say
very
clearly
their
opinion
full
weight
to
these
temporary
certificates.
the
temporary
certificate
order
does
consider
the
price
question
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
can
do
so
at
that
time
under
the
absence
of
a
record
and
all
of
the
other
situations
which
exist
in
the
temporary.
but
they
do
consider
the
price
question.
and
they
do
condition
the
price
down
to
the
guideline
levels.
therefore,
the
commission
thought
that
they
could
give
some
consideration
to
these
temporaries
in
determining
the
in-line
price.
and
that's
what
they
did.
if
they
had
given
full
weight
to
the
temporaries,
they
would
have
had
to
found
the
price
line
to
be
higher
than
that
which
they
did
find.
now,
we
believe
that
decision
is
correct.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
take-or-pay
clause.
and
i
believe
there's
some
misunderstanding
which
may
exist
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
first
of
all,
mr.
simons
stated
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
balancing
between
the
consumer
interests,
as
he
terms
himself,
and
the
producers.
we
feel
that
the
balancing
which
the
commission
did
here
was
on
the
one
hand,
to
determine
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
price.
in
other
words
they
will
hold
the
price
down
as
low
as
they
can
but
there
is
one
other
important
consideration
and
that
is,
if
they
force
this
price
too
low,
they
will
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
sufficient
supply
for
the
consumers.
now,
this
is
just
basic
economics.
it's
true
in
all
sections
of
the
economy
whether
regulated
or
non-regulated.
they
have
to
weigh
on
the
one
hand,
the
supplies
which
will
be
brought
forth
by
the
price
and
on
the
other
hand
the
price
to
be
found.
now,
the
commission
did
consider
the
supply
question
in
this
area.
in
the
commission's
brief
to
this
court
on
page
19,
the
commission
states,
“the
commissions
essential
duty
in
passing
upon
the
applicant's
initial
price
is
to
evaluate
market
conditions.
and
in
this
light
to
a
say
a
reasonable
approximation
of
the
fair
price
for
gas.
a
figure
which
will
presumably
elicit
continuing
supplies
for
the
interstate
market
yet
protect
against
the
danger
of
excessive
and
inflationary
price
proposals
by
the
dominant
supplies.”
and
in
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
in
the
sunray
case,
they
referred
to
this
balancing
between
the
supply
problem
and
the
price
problem.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
function
basically
of
the
federal
power
commission.
it's
to
balances
these
two
issues.
now,
let's
see
what
the
record
shows
with
reference
to
supply
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
need
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
amerada
case.
it
was
raised
by
the
distributor
interest
in
districts
2
and
3,
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
raised
in
there.
turning
back
to
the
contract
to
the
supply
problem,
the
record
does
show
because
the
contracts
which
were
entered
into
during
this
period.
and
it
shows
the
volumes
which
were
committed
under
those
contracts.
we
have
a
table
which
is
attached
to
appendix
c
to
our
brief,
which
shows
these
volumes
which
were
committed
in
the
interstate
commerce.
and
in
district
3,
the
figures
are
particularly
significant.
the
new
contract
volumes
in
district
3
declined
from
33
billion
cubic
feet
per
year
in
1958
to
only
2.7
billion
cubic
feet
in
1963.
these
new
gas
reserves
committed
in
districts
2
and
3
from
september
28,
1960
to
about
the
end
of
1963
were
approximately
1.2
trillion
cubic
feet.
during
the
same
time
period,
the
pipelines
in
this
area
withdrew
2.9
trillion
cubic
feet
over
twice
as
much
from
their
existing
reserves
as
they
were
able
to
compact
for
in
this
supply.
we
feel
that
the
commission
did
consider
this
in
determining
that
the
price
line
should
be
where
it
was.
now,
mr.
simons
has
raise
at
some
length
the
take-or-pay
problem
of
the
pipeline
chemicals.
i
would
like
to
first
focus
on
that.
now
in
our
view
if
the
take-or-pay
problem
is
a
problem,
and
we
deny
that
it
is,
it
should
be
--
the
emphasis
should
be
in
the
material
facts
or
the
take-or-pay
problem
existing
in
the
pipelines
buying
gas
in
these
proceedings
and
in
these
areas
not
in
general
industry-wide
statistics,
which
is
what
mr.
simons
quoted
to
you.
now,
i
like
to
give
you
the
figures
from
the
record
on
the
take-or-pay
positions
of
the
pipelines
in
this
case.
there
are
five
pipelines
buying
gas
from
the
dockets
and
districts
2
and
3.
the
first
one
is
tennessee
gas
company.
it
had
a
take-or-pay
balance
as
of
december
31st,
1963
and
this
evidence
is
in
the
record.
$1,322,000m,
this
compares
with
an
annual
throughput
of
--
in
tennessee
system
of
over
1
trillion
cubic
feet
per
year.
$1,000.322.00,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir.
i
think
--
let
me
go
into
that
because
i
think
it's
very
important.
the
pipelines
have
contracts
which
provide
that
if
they
do
not
take
the
contract
quantity
of
the
gas,
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
now,
the
figure
which
i
gave
you
is
the
total
balance,
not
an
annual
fee.
it's
the
total
balance
which
tennessee
has
for
all
of
its
contracts.
and
i
should
again
emphasize
that
this
balance
is
not
something
to
take
that
the
tennessee
pipeline
and
its
customers
have
to
pay
that
the
never
received
any
value
for
it.
it
is
simply
like
paying
rent
in
advance.
the
pipeline
has
the
right
to
make
up
this
gas
at
no
cost
to
itself
in
later
years.
and
the
commission
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
limited
to
certain
volumes
but
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
limited
in
time.
and
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
jumping
around
a
little
bit
here
but
in
response
to
your
question,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
commission
has
thoroughly
considered
the
take-or-pay
clause
in
its
real
making
docket
r-199.
and
the
certificates
in
this
proceeding
were
specifically
conditioned
to
that
docket.
and
the
commission
found
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir.
the
commission
found
in
docket
r-199
that
it
could
fully
protect
the
consumer
from
any
forfeiture.
and
the
commission
has
repeatedly
found
and
found
on
the
same
pages
of
the
annual
reports
referred
to
by
mr.
simons
that
the
pipelines
have
not
made
any
substantial
forfeitures
of
gas
under
this
take-or-pay
clause.
and
the
commission
found
that
if
it
permitted
a
minimum
of
five
years
for
the
makeup
of
the
gas
under
the
take-or-pay
provision,
it
would
have
adequately
protected
the
consumer
and
the
dockets
in
this
proceeding
were
specifically
conditioned
to
permit
such
a
makeup
period
where
they
did
it
already
and
most
of
them
did.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
commission
decision
in
docket
r-199
came
out
about
a
week
before
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
in
this
case.
and
we
believe
that
it's
significant
that
even
though
the
distributors
admit
that
the
commission
decided
against
them
in
docket
r-199,
they
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
and
that
decision
is
now
final
unless
it
is
subject
to
collateral
attack
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
but
the
commission
in
its
order
issuing
these
certificates
made
it
specifically
subject
to
docket
r-199
and
its
findings
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir.
natural
gas
pipeline
company
had
no
take-or-pay
obligation
or
whatever.
trunkline
gas
company
had
no
take-or-pay
obligation
or
whatever.
florida
gas
transmission
company
had
$384,000
in
their
total
system.
united
gas
pipeline
company
had
$19,829,360.
now,
that
looks
like
a
large
figure
until
it's
compared
with
the
annual
throughput
in
united
system
of
1.3
trillion
cubic
feet.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
average
price
is
in
united
system.
but
if
we
assume
an
average
price
of
15
cents,
that
means
an
annual
throughput
by
united
of
over
a
$165
million
a
year.
so
it's
not
a
very
large
figure
when
the
--
when
you
look
at
take-or-pay
balance
of
$19
million.
now,
we've
also
looked
at
the
commission's
records
and
brought
these
figures
up
to
date.
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
those
figures,
if
i
may.
with
reference
to
tennessee,
the
annual
take
up
--
the
take-or-pay
volumes
as
of
december
31st,
1966
which
are
the
last
figures
available
in
the
commission's
record
was
$2,127,742.
natural
gas
pipelines
still
have
none
at
all,
trunkline
still
have
none
at
all.
florida
gas
transmission
had
completely
eliminated
the
balance
it
had
before
and
showed
no
balance
at
all.
united
gas
pipeline
had
reduced
their
balance
by
25%
to
something
over
$15
million.
so
you
see
this
is
not
a
real
problem.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
figures
for
1966,
of
course,
are
obviously
not
in
this
record.
they
are
taken
from
the
form
2
reports
filed
by
the
pipelines
with
the
federal
power
commission
which
is
the
same
source
that
mr.
simons
is
referring
to
when
he
gives
the
take-or-pay
balance
figures
for
the
industry.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
black,
they
have
paid
for
gas
which
they
have
not
received
yet.
and
the
yet
is
the
important
thing
because
the
pipelines
do
have
the
right
under
their
contracts
to
make
up
this
gas
at
no
cost
in
subsequent
years.
and
the
pipelines
have
always
been
able
to
do
this.
that's
why
the
commission
found
in
docket
r-199
that
this
take-or-pay
problem
was
not
a
problem
to
the
industry.
and
that's
what
the
commission
meant
when
it
said
that
the
pipelines
normally
have
to
contract
to
take
care
of
a
year
when
they
may
not
be
able
to
buy
it
again
or
another
year
when
they
may
have
a
demand
which
they
have
not
previously
anticipated.
the
pipelines
simply
cannot
under
the
nature
of
their
operations
go
out
and
buy
every
year
all
of
the
gas
which
they
need
to
replace
the
supplies
which
are
being
consumed
together
with
all
the
gas
they
need
for
growth.
it's
just
not
that
accurate
a
projection.
the
pipelines
have
to
protect
themselves.
and
the
commission
realizes
this,
they
continually,
as
mr.
schiff
pointed
out,
supervised
the
pipeline's
operations.
if
the
pipelines
were
out
of
line
on
this,
the
commission
would
certainly
catch
them
up.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that's
right.
and
the
com
--
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no,
your
honor.
they
don't
reach
this
question
because
the
pipelines
continually
incur
take-or-pay
balances
on
other
contracts.
and
the
take-or-pay
balances
incidentally
which
i
cited
to
you
basically
from
contracts
in
south
louisiana.
they
aren't
even
contracts
in
this
case.
but
it's
a
continuing
thing.
the
pipelines
may
take
more
in
one
contract
in
south
louisiana
than
their
contract
provides
for.
they
incur
a
small
balance
in
that
contract.
then
the
next
year,
then
may
incur
a
balance
over
another
contract
and
make
this
one
up.
this
goes
on
all
the
time
in
the
pipeline
industry.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir,
i'll
be
happy
to
lodge
them
to
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
on
the
need
issue
before
i
close
and
that
is
that
the
producers
introduced
in
these
proceedings
evidence
to
show
that
the
need
for
gas,
the
supply
problem
i've
been
talking
about
was
such
that
the
commission
could
certificate
their
contracts
even
though
they
found
these
contracts
to
be
out
of
line.
this
evidence
was
excluded
on
the
motion
of
mr.
simons,
the
attorney
for
the
distributors.
and
so
the
reason
why
there
is
not
more
evidence
in
this
proceeding
on
the
question
of
need
is
not
because
the
producers
failed
to
introduce
it,
it's
because
it
was
excluded
on
distributor
mode.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
greene
johnson.
i
represent
shell
oil
company,
the
petitioner
in
case
number
111.
and
i
appear
here
also
on
behalf
of
humble
skelly
and
the
other
petitioners
in
case
number
143.
we
are
aligned
with
the
commission
on
two
of
the
three
issues
involved
here.
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
determined
in
railroad
districts
2
and
3,
and
the
texas
gulf
coast
area,
we
support
the
commission's
decision.
on
the
need
issue,
we
further
support
the
commission's
decision
that
the
proper
place
to
consider
this
issue
is
in
a
pipeline
certificate
proceeding
and
not
a
producer
certificate
proceeding.
both
of
these
decisions
by
the
commission
were
held
beyond
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
in-line
issue.
and
first
of
all,
i
would
like
the
court
to
direct
this
attention
to
the
role
of
the
distributor
interest
in
these
in-line
proceedings.
the
commission
has
discussed
at
great
length
the
commission's
procedure.
the
distributors
yesterday
pointed
out
the
efforts
that
producers
have
made
to
obtain
a
contract
prices.
i
would
request
to
the
court
now
direct
its
attention
to
the
role
of
the
distributors
in
these
cases.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
you,
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
mr.
coleman
yesterday.
the
first
of
which
was,
how
much
money
will
the
distributors
receive
in
refunds?
and
how
much
will
they
pass
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer?
in
this
connection,
mr.
coleman
had
pointed
out
that
pipelines
are
not
participants
in
these
proceedings.
we
disagree
with
mr.
coleman's
reason
for
that.
but
his
reason
was
that
the
rate
increases
can
be
passed
along
by
the
pipelines.
in
our
view,
the
real
reason
why
the
pipelines
are
not
here
is
because,
they
already
have
their
opportunity
when
they
negotiated
the
contracts
with
the
producers.
and
they
did
not
feel
on
the
position
to
attack
those
contracts
which
they
themselves
negotiated
before
the
commission.
to
be
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
rephrase
mr.
coleman's
question
and
ask
why
the
distributor
companies
are
always
such
active
partners
in
these
proceedings
before
the
commission
on
the
courts
and
if
as
they
contend,
they
are
simply
conduits
of
this
line.
and
it's
all
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
and
that
answer
is
that
the
distributor
company
to
do
retain
a
large
amount
of
the
refunds
which
will
be
ordered
in
this
case,
if
the
commission
is
sustained
and
larger
amounts
of
refunds,
if
the
distributor
position
is
sustained.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
record
shows
this.
the
commission
undertook
in
1962
and
1963
a
survey
that
the
distributor
companies.
and
they
asked
these
distributor
companies
how
much
refunds
they
were
passing
along.
this
evidence
was
compiled
by
a
producer
witness.
and
that
witness
testified
that
that
questionnaire
showed
that
42%
of
the
refunds
received
by
the
distributing
companies
during
the
period
covered
by
the
commission's
survey
which
was
about
--
well,
from
july
1961
and
november
1962,
during
that
period,
the
distributors
retained
42%
of
the
money
which
they
received.
those
moneys
amounted
according
to
the
commission's
record,
to
$51.9
million.
that
evidence
was
excluded
by
the
presiding
examiner
on
the
motion
of
distributing
companies.
so
therefore,
it
was
not
before
the
commission
and
unfortunately
we
have
not
included
there
in
the
joint
appendix
because
our
posture
here
is
to
support
the
commission's
decision.
nonetheless,
that
evidence
is
in
the
record
i
offered
proof.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
merely
–
i'm
raising
this
question
in
order
to
point
out
that
the
real
representative
of
the
consumer
in
these
proceedings
is
the
person
that's
the
--
or
the
part
that
the
statute
has
required
and
represented
themselves.
and
that's
the
federal
partnership.
it's
not
the
distributor
companies.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
alright
sir,
i
like
to
address
myself
to
that.
aside
from
the
motives
of
the
distributor
companies,
we
would
like
now
to
focus
on
their
objectives.
and
their
objective,
they
have
made
clear
at
various
points
in
their
briefs
but
they
do
not
emphasize
it
in
this
case.
that
objective
is
very
simple.
the
objective
is
to
freeze
the
price
line
at
the
levels
that
have
existed
from
1958
to
1960.
now,
for
some
mean,
by
some
means
known
only
to
the
distributor's
interest,
they
determine
that
this
line
should
be
frozen,
somewhere
in
the
area
between
14
and
15
cents.
they
then
embark
on
a
program
of
intervening
in
all
producer
certificate
cases
where
the
prices
exceeded
those
levels.
by
this
method
of
intervention,
they
were
able
to
and
by
prolonged
litigation
on
these
contract
prices
they
were
able
to
place
these
prices
in
a
suspect
category
over
a
long
period
of
time.
as
a
result,
the
commission
under
the
rules
announced
by
various
circuit
courts
did
not
consider
these
prices
when
it
originally
determined
the
line
in
these
areas.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
during
the
time
that
the
contracts
in
these
proceedings
were
made,
there
were
no
in-line
prices
in
these
areas
for
any
period.
these
contracts
were
made
in
the
time
period
from
september
28,
1960
to
about
the
end
of
1963.
the
in-line
prices
were
not
determined
by
the
commission
for
this
same
period.
for
amerada,
the
decision
came
out
in
august
of
1962.
for
the
hawkins
case,
the
decision
in
district
3
in
the
earlier
case
was
decided
in
march
27,
1963.
in
district
2,
the
decision
by
the
commission
covering
the
earlier
of
period
was
in
december
9,
1963.
in
all
of
the
amerada
sales
and
one
of
the
hawkins
sales
and
in
all
but
one
of
the
sinclair
sales,
there
was
no
in-line
price
determined
by
the
commission
at
the
time
these
sales
were
made.
yet
the
distributors
continued
to
intervene
in
these
cases
above
the
level
which
they
had
determined,
not
a
commission
determined
level.
all
the
industry
had
to
look
to
was
the
18
cent
guideline
level
which
the
commission
had
determined,
which
the
distributors
contend
cannot
be
utilized
in
this
case.
we
have
detailed
further
in
our
brief
the
methods
which
the
distributors
have
followed
in
attempting
to
exclude
all
of
the
evidences
which
the
commission
could
possibly
use
to
find
that
the
price
line
was
higher
for
the
1960s
than
it
was
in
the
1950s.
i
would
like
to
focus
now
on
the
question
which
mr.
justice
white
has
raised
last
night
and
again
this
morning
with
reference
to
the
relation
between
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
has
determined
here
in
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
i
believe
it
is
now
clear
that
the
in-line
price
is
the
level
to
which
refunds
will
be
ordered
in
this
case.
and
it
is
the
level
if
it's
too
high
that
is
if
it's
above
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
producers
can
retroactively
file
for
this
difference
correspondingly
if
in-line
price
is
below
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
there
is
no
way
that
refunds
can
be
required
for
this
difference.
so
really
in
our
view,
what
the
commission
was
attempting
to
do
here
and
they
used
the
terms
fair
and
reasonable.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
is
ultimately
correct
that
these
are
different
sections
of
the
statute.
but
at
least
in
the
commission's
consideration,
the
standards
which
they
use
i
think
are
very
closely
approached
each
other
to
the
extent
that
they
can
under
the
limited
consideration
which
the
commission
can
give
the
evidence
in
an
in-line
proceeding.
so
i
think
it's
material
here
to
at
least
consider
to
the
extent
that
we
can
whether
the
in-line
price
will
be
above
or
below
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
mr.
tell
mentioned
this
briefly
in
his
argument.
we
do
have
some
guidelines
on
this.
in
the
permian
case
which
was
argued
before
this
court
last
december,
one
of
the
findings
which
the
commission
made
in
that
case
was
the
national
cost
of
gas
for
1960.
now,
of
course,
the
national
cost
includes
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
here.
and
that
finding
was
16.43
cents
per
mcf
national
cost.
now,
in
the
permian
case
as
mr.
tell
pointed
out,
the
commission
had
previously
determined
an
in-line
price
for
that
area
of
the
16
cents.
in
their
price
for
new
gas,
in
the
permian
area,
they
determined
that
part
level
to
be
16
1/2
cents,
one
half
cent
above
the
in-line
price.
mr.
tell
has
pointed
out
that
the
record
is
now
closed
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
rate
proceeding.
and
that
the
commission
staff
has
recommended
a
price
for
new
gas
and
incidentally
new
gas
as
defined
by
the
commission
on
the
permian
case
and
by
the
commission
staff
in
this
case
as
involving
all
contracts
dated
after
january
1st,
1961.
now,
you
see
there's
only
three
months
or
two
months
difference
between
the
dividing
line
on
the
policy
statement,
the
definite
periods
selected
for
the
in-line
price,
and
the
dividing
line
between
new
and
old
gas
which
the
commission
has
found
different
rates
for
in
the
area
rate
proceedings.
the
commission
staff
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
rate
proceeding
for
gas
delivered
at
a
central
point
which
is
the
predominant
method
of
delivery
has
recommended
that
just
and
reasonable
rate
of
16.8
cents.
and
even
more
significantly
a
witness
for
the
same
--
some
of
the
same
distributor
companies
which
are
here
attacking
the
in-line
price
made
a
recommendation
for
texas
railroad
district
4
for
new
gas
of
16.25
cents,
for
railroad
district
2,
16.75
cents,
and
for
railroad
district
3,
17.25
cents.
now,
i
should
add
that
the
cut
off
date
which
the
distributors
recommend
is
january
1st,
1963
not
'61.
but
if
the
commission
follows
its
decision
in
the
permian
case
and
finds
to
cut
off
date
for
the
reasons
which
they
gave
in
that
case
to
the
january
1st,
1961.
even
under
the
distributor
recommendations,
the
in-line
price
will
be
below
with
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
filed.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
--
very
briefly
to
point
out
two
things
with
reference
to
the
use
of
temporary
certificates.
first
of
all,
the
deliveries
are
conducted
most
under
these
proceedings,
under
temporary
certificates,
because
of
interventions
which
the
distributor
companies
filed
which
force
contested
proceedings,
thus
required
a
very
lengthy
proceeding.
and
under
the
circumstances
there,
the
producers
there
had
no
alternative
but
to
apply
for
temporary
certificates
so
they
can
begin
delivering
their
gas.
secondly,
the
commission
did
not
give
as
i
say
very
clearly
their
opinion
full
weight
to
these
temporary
certificates.
the
temporary
certificate
order
does
consider
the
price
question
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
can
do
so
at
that
time
under
the
absence
of
a
record
and
all
of
the
other
situations
which
exist
in
the
temporary.
but
they
do
consider
the
price
question.
and
they
do
condition
the
price
down
to
the
guideline
levels.
therefore,
the
commission
thought
that
they
could
give
some
consideration
to
these
temporaries
in
determining
the
in-line
price.
and
that's
what
they
did.
if
they
had
given
full
weight
to
the
temporaries,
they
would
have
had
to
found
the
price
line
to
be
higher
than
that
which
they
did
find.
now,
we
believe
that
decision
is
correct.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
take-or-pay
clause.
and
i
believe
there's
some
misunderstanding
which
may
exist
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
first
of
all,
mr.
simons
stated
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
balancing
between
the
consumer
interests,
as
he
terms
himself,
and
the
producers.
we
feel
that
the
balancing
which
the
commission
did
here
was
on
the
one
hand,
to
determine
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
price.
in
other
words
they
will
hold
the
price
down
as
low
as
they
can
but
there
is
one
other
important
consideration
and
that
is,
if
they
force
this
price
too
low,
they
will
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
sufficient
supply
for
the
consumers.
now,
this
is
just
basic
economics.
it's
true
in
all
sections
of
the
economy
whether
regulated
or
non-regulated.
they
have
to
weigh
on
the
one
hand,
the
supplies
which
will
be
brought
forth
by
the
price
and
on
the
other
hand
the
price
to
be
found.
now,
the
commission
did
consider
the
supply
question
in
this
area.
in
the
commission's
brief
to
this
court
on
page
19,
the
commission
states,
“the
commissions
essential
duty
in
passing
upon
the
applicant's
initial
price
is
to
evaluate
market
conditions.
and
in
this
light
to
a
say
a
reasonable
approximation
of
the
fair
price
for
gas.
a
figure
which
will
presumably
elicit
continuing
supplies
for
the
interstate
market
yet
protect
against
the
danger
of
excessive
and
inflationary
price
proposals
by
the
dominant
supplies.”
and
in
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
in
the
sunray
case,
they
referred
to
this
balancing
between
the
supply
problem
and
the
price
problem.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
function
basically
of
the
federal
power
commission.
it's
to
balances
these
two
issues.
now,
let's
see
what
the
record
shows
with
reference
to
supply
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
need
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
amerada
case.
it
was
raised
by
the
distributor
interest
in
districts
2
and
3,
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
raised
in
there.
turning
back
to
the
contract
to
the
supply
problem,
the
record
does
show
because
the
contracts
which
were
entered
into
during
this
period.
and
it
shows
the
volumes
which
were
committed
under
those
contracts.
we
have
a
table
which
is
attached
to
appendix
c
to
our
brief,
which
shows
these
volumes
which
were
committed
in
the
interstate
commerce.
and
in
district
3,
the
figures
are
particularly
significant.
the
new
contract
volumes
in
district
3
declined
from
33
billion
cubic
feet
per
year
in
1958
to
only
2.7
billion
cubic
feet
in
1963.
these
new
gas
reserves
committed
in
districts
2
and
3
from
september
28,
1960
to
about
the
end
of
1963
were
approximately
1.2
trillion
cubic
feet.
during
the
same
time
period,
the
pipelines
in
this
area
withdrew
2.9
trillion
cubic
feet
over
twice
as
much
from
their
existing
reserves
as
they
were
able
to
compact
for
in
this
supply.
we
feel
that
the
commission
did
consider
this
in
determining
that
the
price
line
should
be
where
it
was.
now,
mr.
simons
has
raise
at
some
length
the
take-or-pay
problem
of
the
pipeline
chemicals.
i
would
like
to
first
focus
on
that.
now
in
our
view
if
the
take-or-pay
problem
is
a
problem,
and
we
deny
that
it
is,
it
should
be
--
the
emphasis
should
be
in
the
material
facts
or
the
take-or-pay
problem
existing
in
the
pipelines
buying
gas
in
these
proceedings
and
in
these
areas
not
in
general
industry-wide
statistics,
which
is
what
mr.
simons
quoted
to
you.
now,
i
like
to
give
you
the
figures
from
the
record
on
the
take-or-pay
positions
of
the
pipelines
in
this
case.
there
are
five
pipelines
buying
gas
from
the
dockets
and
districts
2
and
3.
the
first
one
is
tennessee
gas
company.
it
had
a
take-or-pay
balance
as
of
december
31st,
1963
and
this
evidence
is
in
the
record.
$1,322,000m,
this
compares
with
an
annual
throughput
of
--
in
tennessee
system
of
over
1
trillion
cubic
feet
per
year.
$1,000.322.00,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir.
i
think
--
let
me
go
into
that
because
i
think
it's
very
important.
the
pipelines
have
contracts
which
provide
that
if
they
do
not
take
the
contract
quantity
of
the
gas,
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
now,
the
figure
which
i
gave
you
is
the
total
balance,
not
an
annual
fee.
it's
the
total
balance
which
tennessee
has
for
all
of
its
contracts.
and
i
should
again
emphasize
that
this
balance
is
not
something
to
take
that
the
tennessee
pipeline
and
its
customers
have
to
pay
that
the
never
received
any
value
for
it.
it
is
simply
like
paying
rent
in
advance.
the
pipeline
has
the
right
to
make
up
this
gas
at
no
cost
to
itself
in
later
years.
and
the
commission
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
limited
to
certain
volumes
but
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
limited
in
time.
and
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
jumping
around
a
little
bit
here
but
in
response
to
your
question,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
commission
has
thoroughly
considered
the
take-or-pay
clause
in
its
real
making
docket
r-199.
and
the
certificates
in
this
proceeding
were
specifically
conditioned
to
that
docket.
and
the
commission
found
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir.
the
commission
found
in
docket
r-199
that
it
could
fully
protect
the
consumer
from
any
forfeiture.
and
the
commission
has
repeatedly
found
and
found
on
the
same
pages
of
the
annual
reports
referred
to
by
mr.
simons
that
the
pipelines
have
not
made
any
substantial
forfeitures
of
gas
under
this
take-or-pay
clause.
and
the
commission
found
that
if
it
permitted
a
minimum
of
five
years
for
the
makeup
of
the
gas
under
the
take-or-pay
provision,
it
would
have
adequately
protected
the
consumer
and
the
dockets
in
this
proceeding
were
specifically
conditioned
to
permit
such
a
makeup
period
where
they
did
it
already
and
most
of
them
did.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
commission
decision
in
docket
r-199
came
out
about
a
week
before
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
in
this
case.
and
we
believe
that
it's
significant
that
even
though
the
distributors
admit
that
the
commission
decided
against
them
in
docket
r-199,
they
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
and
that
decision
is
now
final
unless
it
is
subject
to
collateral
attack
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
but
the
commission
in
its
order
issuing
these
certificates
made
it
specifically
subject
to
docket
r-199
and
its
findings
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir.
natural
gas
pipeline
company
had
no
take-or-pay
obligation
or
whatever.
trunkline
gas
company
had
no
take-or-pay
obligation
or
whatever.
florida
gas
transmission
company
had
$384,000
in
their
total
system.
united
gas
pipeline
company
had
$19,829,360.
now,
that
looks
like
a
large
figure
until
it's
compared
with
the
annual
throughput
in
united
system
of
1.3
trillion
cubic
feet.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
average
price
is
in
united
system.
but
if
we
assume
an
average
price
of
15
cents,
that
means
an
annual
throughput
by
united
of
over
a
$165
million
a
year.
so
it's
not
a
very
large
figure
when
the
--
when
you
look
at
take-or-pay
balance
of
$19
million.
now,
we've
also
looked
at
the
commission's
records
and
brought
these
figures
up
to
date.
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
those
figures,
if
i
may.
with
reference
to
tennessee,
the
annual
take
up
--
the
take-or-pay
volumes
as
of
december
31st,
1966
which
are
the
last
figures
available
in
the
commission's
record
was
$2,127,742.
natural
gas
pipelines
still
have
none
at
all,
trunkline
still
have
none
at
all.
florida
gas
transmission
had
completely
eliminated
the
balance
it
had
before
and
showed
no
balance
at
all.
united
gas
pipeline
had
reduced
their
balance
by
25%
to
something
over
$15
million.
so
you
see
this
is
not
a
real
problem.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
figures
for
1966,
of
course,
are
obviously
not
in
this
record.
they
are
taken
from
the
form
2
reports
filed
by
the
pipelines
with
the
federal
power
commission
which
is
the
same
source
that
mr.
simons
is
referring
to
when
he
gives
the
take-or-pay
balance
figures
for
the
industry.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
justice
black,
they
have
paid
for
gas
which
they
have
not
received
yet.
and
the
yet
is
the
important
thing
because
the
pipelines
do
have
the
right
under
their
contracts
to
make
up
this
gas
at
no
cost
in
subsequent
years.
and
the
pipelines
have
always
been
able
to
do
this.
that's
why
the
commission
found
in
docket
r-199
that
this
take-or-pay
problem
was
not
a
problem
to
the
industry.
and
that's
what
the
commission
meant
when
it
said
that
the
pipelines
normally
have
to
contract
to
take
care
of
a
year
when
they
may
not
be
able
to
buy
it
again
or
another
year
when
they
may
have
a
demand
which
they
have
not
previously
anticipated.
the
pipelines
simply
cannot
under
the
nature
of
their
operations
go
out
and
buy
every
year
all
of
the
gas
which
they
need
to
replace
the
supplies
which
are
being
consumed
together
with
all
the
gas
they
need
for
growth.
it's
just
not
that
accurate
a
projection.
the
pipelines
have
to
protect
themselves.
and
the
commission
realizes
this,
they
continually,
as
mr.
schiff
pointed
out,
supervised
the
pipeline's
operations.
if
the
pipelines
were
out
of
line
on
this,
the
commission
would
certainly
catch
them
up.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that's
right.
and
the
com
--
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no,
your
honor.
they
don't
reach
this
question
because
the
pipelines
continually
incur
take-or-pay
balances
on
other
contracts.
and
the
take-or-pay
balances
incidentally
which
i
cited
to
you
basically
from
contracts
in
south
louisiana.
they
aren't
even
contracts
in
this
case.
but
it's
a
continuing
thing.
the
pipelines
may
take
more
in
one
contract
in
south
louisiana
than
their
contract
provides
for.
they
incur
a
small
balance
in
that
contract.
then
the
next
year,
then
may
incur
a
balance
over
another
contract
and
make
this
one
up.
this
goes
on
all
the
time
in
the
pipeline
industry.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir,
i'll
be
happy
to
lodge
them
to
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
on
the
need
issue
before
i
close
and
that
is
that
the
producers
introduced
in
these
proceedings
evidence
to
show
that
the
need
for
gas,
the
supply
problem
i've
been
talking
about
was
such
that
the
commission
could
certificate
their
contracts
even
though
they
found
these
contracts
to
be
out
of
line.
this
evidence
was
excluded
on
the
motion
of
mr.
simons,
the
attorney
for
the
distributors.
and
so
the
reason
why
there
is
not
more
evidence
in
this
proceeding
on
the
question
of
need
is
not
because
the
producers
failed
to
introduce
it,
it's
because
it
was
excluded
on
distributor
mode.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
