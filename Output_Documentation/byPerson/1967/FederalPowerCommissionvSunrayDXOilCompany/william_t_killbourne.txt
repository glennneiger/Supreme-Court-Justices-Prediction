mr.
william
t.
killbourne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
killbourne,
the
counsel
for
the
superior
oil
company,
petitioner
number
231.
superior
is
the
only
party
to
these
consolidated
proceedings
that
has
thought
to
review
on
the
price
findings
of
the
commission
as
well
as
the
court
position
below,
due
to
a
15-minute
time
restriction,
i
shall
limit
my
comments
to
two
areas
dealing
with
the
construction
of
the
initial
in-line
price
for
the
period
1958
to
1960.
i
refer
you
to
a
full
discussion
of
superior's
position
on
our
initial
brief
in
reply
briefs
filed
previously
with
this
court.
the
commission
opinion
475
concluded
that
the
proper
initial
certificate
price
for
producer
applicants
in
texas
railroad
commission
district
number
3
for
the
period
prior
september
28,
1960
was
16
cents
per
mcf.
superior
challenges
this
conclusion
and
the
findings
there
under
for
the
reason
that
the
commission
refused
to
consider
all
the
record
evidence.
specifically,
the
superior's
protest
is
the
commission's
refusal
to
include
all
high
volume,
non-suspect
permanent
certificates
and
a
computation
of
the
average
weighted
price
used
by
this
commission
to
ultimately
determine
the
in-line
price
for
such
period
this
court's
catco
decision
in
1959
helped
delay
of
the
commission
in
determining
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
required
a
most
careful
scrutiny
of
initial
price
proposals
of
the
producers
under
section
7.
this
commission
has
since
developed
the
in-line
price
technique
to
meet
this
duty
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
ninth
circuit
is
now
famous
as
ugi
case
on
which
the
commission
so
heavily
relies
considered
the
in-line
price
technique
to
be
a
simple,
direct,
and
effective
device
on
which
to
determine
the
in-line
price.
callery
said
the
proper
and
only
evidence
necessary
to
establish
a
price
line
can
allow
a
proper
evaluation
of
all
factors
bearing
on
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
was
a
field
price
study.
this
court
in
callery
held
that
adequate
consumer
protection
under
section
7
was
attained
through
the
utilization
of
the
in-line
price
technique
and
the
related
suspect
price
doctrine.
this
court
in
callery
approved
a
certification
of
applications
of
the
highest
price
level
after
elimination
of
suspect
prices.
prices
tainted
by
the
erroneously
issued
and
remanded
catco
certificates
were
set
aside.
only
prices
then
subject
to
court
and
commission
review
as
well
as
like
prices
in
the
same
area
not
currently
under
review
will
regard
as
suspect.
the
general
concept
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine
that
is
prices
still
subject
to
commission
in
court
review
was
urged
by
the
commission
and
approved
by
this
court
in
callery.
and
it
is
now
urged
in
the
commission's
initial
brief
in
this
proceeding.
it
is
a
distorted
application
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine
that
causes
the
commission
to
commit
legal
error
in
the
record
below
and
not
the
definition
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
justice
harlan
concurring
in
the
line
determination
in
callery,
said
the
in-line
price
was
comparatively
easy
to
fix.
his
statement
is
correct
but
i
would
submit
that
if
the
fixing
of
the
line
is
done
improperly,
then
the
whole
purpose
of
the
stock
gas
measure
is
blunted.
mr.
justice
harlan
also
expressed
great
concern
for
the
use
of
a
crooked
measuring
rod
derived
from
a
too
broad
application
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine.
that
would
result
in
too
lower
price
line.
the
producer
and
consumer
are
permanently
injured
by
the
uncertainty
and
the
price
instability,
the
results
from
unduly
low
price
line.
the
line
determination
is
an
artificial
approach.
and
although
mechanically
easy
to
compute,
the
commission
must
make
full
use
of
the
proper
inputs
to
arrive
at
a
proper
place
line.
the
commission
has
totally
ignored
nine
final
non-suspect
20-cent
permanent
certificates
and
six
other
large
volume
final
non-suspect
permanent
certificates.
the
commission
opinion
475
acknowledged
the
charismatic
impact
for
this
nine
20
cents
sales,
certificated
in
1959
the
trunkline
gas
company.
but
stated
or
eliminated
from
the
weighted
average
price
determination
because
such
elimination
was
consistent
with
an
earlier
district
3
certificate
proceeding,
texaco
seaboard
opinion
383
to
which
superior
was
not
a
party
and
to
which
no
appeal
was
ever
taken.
the
only
reason
given
by
the
commission
for
eliminating
these
sales
was
that
six
of
the
nine
20-cent
sales
would
have
been
set
aside
on
the
new
york
public
service
commission's
petition
for
review
of
a
commission
ordered
denying
intervention
but
for
the
failure
to
prefect
their
appeal.
this
reading
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
that's
correct
sir.
both
periods.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
no
sir,
i'm
limiting
my
argument
to
which
superior
was
only
a
party
district
3.
mr.
johnson
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
he's
representing
clients
from
both
districts.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
there
were
some
producers
who
accepted
the
in-line
price
determination
of
the
commission
who
never
sought
any
appeal
whatsoever.
there
were
some
producers
who
sought
review
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
and
that
accepted
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
before
this
court
support
the
in-line
determination
of
the
commission
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
that's
correct.
the
fact
remains
at
the
trunkline
sales
were
certificated
a
20-cent
permanent
certificate
rate
after
a
full
hearing
in
which
producer
hawkins,
the
commission
staff
and
16
interveners
including
the
michigan
public
service
commission,
the
state
of
intended
consumption
of
the
gas
had
fully
participated,
briefs
exceptions
to
the
examiner's
decision
and
applications
for
rehearing
were
filed.
oral
argument
was
held
before
the
commission
in
a
fully
considered
opinion
issuing
permanent
certificates
at
20
cents
was
issued.
clearly
there
was
no
price
infirmity
resulting
from
the
commission
order.
the
public
service
commission
filed
knows
of
intervention
in
that
proceeding
as
provided
for
in
the
rules
of
the
commission.
in
line
with
the
established
commission
policy
at
that
time,
the
commission
found
that
a
denial
of
intervention
was
required
because
allegations
of
the
would-be
intervener,
the
public
service
commission,
failed
to
show
a
direct
or
immediate
interest
to
justify
their
intervention
as
a
matter
of
right.
however,
in
deference
to
public
service
commission
it
was
offered
the
status
of
a
limited
participant
in
the
proceeding
to
show
to
the
examiner
that
the
public
service
commission
had
a
sufficient
interest
and
that
its
intervention
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
the
public
service
commission
elected
not
to
exercise
this
right
of
limited
participation
and
made
no
appearance
in
the
proceeding.
subsequently,
an
order
was
issued
denying
intervention
and
the
public
service
commission's
petition
for
review
with
that
order
denying
intervention
was
dismissed.
the
failure
to
perfect
the
petition
for
review
whether
the
intervention
in
hindsight
was
proper
or
not
is
no
more
failed
to
the
correctness
of
the
trunkline
opinion
in
the
20-cent
certificate
therein,
then
would
be
the
producers
fair
to
brief
and
argue
the
in-line
issue
and
the
callery
case
suggest
that
the
callery
case
is
wrong.
both
decisions
must
be
taken
as
correct
and
they
have
an
impact
on
this
proceeding
here.
the
20-cent
sales
became
final
after
the
judicial
review
and
are
taking
place
to
this
date.
clearly,
they
were
not
erroneously
issued.
no
action
has
been
taken
to
modify
them
to
any
individual
section
5
(a)
complaint
proceeding,
which
maybe
initiated
either
by
the
commission
or
by
any
producer,
distributor,
or
party
agreed.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
thank
you.
we
were
talking
before
the
luncheon
break
about
the
commission
action
eliminating
certain
permanent
non-suspect
certificates.
and
the
method
the
commission
selected
to
hold
the
line
is
the
in-line
method
approved
by
this
court
in
callery.
and
the
commission
consistently
states
that
the
in-line
price
is
derived
from
a
review
of
only
permanent
non-suspect
certificates
when
available.
then
superior
insists
that
every
comparable
permanent
certificate,
not
classified
suspect
under
the
suspect
price
doctrine,
be
included
in
that
determination.
the
commission
has
selected
the
method
and
it
is
under
a
legal
obligation
to
apply
it
consistently.
the
commission
cannot
be
allowed
to
pick
and
choose
among
otherwise
helpful
permanent
certificates
no
longer
subject
to
review
in
order
to
find
the
price
line.
the
error
of
citing
texaco
seaboard
has
authority
to
disregard
these
sales
must
not
be
allowed
to
result
in
unduly
low
price
line.
full
consideration
of
these
sales
raises
the
average
weighted
price
to
16.92
cents
per
mcf.
opinion
475
has
done
a
weight
average
place
for
the
period
involved
of
15.16
cents
per
mcf.
the
fixing
of
the
in-line
price
at
the
highest
level
of
prices
after
elimination
of
property
suspect
prices
were
at
some
level
between
the
weighted
average
price
of
16.92
cents
and
20
cents
would
result
in
a
price
line
that
would
justify
superior's
sale
in
this
proceeding.
the
commission
committed
further
error
in
refusing
to
use
six
permanent
certificates
issued
by
the
commission
under
settlement
orders.
the
prices
of
these
file
certificates
ranged
from
16
to
18
cents
per
mcf
and
would
have
a
clearly
upward
impact
on
the
average
weighted
price.
the
commission
has
made
an
express
finding
that
such
certificates
resulted
from
settlements
are
required
by
the
public
interest.
the
certificates
result
from
proposals
or
producers
concurred
in
by
regulatory
bodies,
distribution
companies,
and
the
commission
to
accept
amended
price
levels
in
order
to
obtain
permanent
certificates
at
firm
prices
without
the
usual
administrative
delay.
the
purposes
that
motivated
the
parties
to
a
settlement
are
identical
with
the
purposes
of
the
producer
in
a
contested
certificate
proceeding.
whatever
the
reasons
for
seeking
a
settlement,
the
obligations
of
the
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act
are
unchanged.
it
may
not,
for
its
own
convenience,
issue
an
order
that
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
settlement
orders
specifically
find
that
the
prices
approved
by
the
commission
are
required
by
the
public
interest.
the
permanent
certificate
is
in
all
respect
final
and
beyond
review.
permanent
certificates
resulting
from
settlements
have
never
been
considered
erroneous
or
suspect.
in
addition,
settlements
represent
current
conditions
in
the
regulated
industry.
they
reflect
the
consider
judgment
not
only
the
commission
and
the
producer,
but
also
the
expressed
or
tacit
approval
of
the
distributors
and
the
regulatory
state
bodies
who
have
actively
participated
and
who
were
submitted
the
proposed
settlement
offered
before
the
commission
issued
it's
final
order.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
in-line
pricing,
where
permanent
certificates
are
available
to
rely
exclusively
on
permanent
certificates.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
that
is
my
position
also.
and
these
are
permanent
certificates
and
must
be
relied
on
by
the
commission
and
not
ignored.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
temporary
certificates
can
be
looked
to
determine
the
current
market
as
they've
done
in
the
callery
case
in
this
instance
so
the
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
i
would
refer
you
to
the
callery
case,
mr.
justice
white,
where
in
fact
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
no
sir.
no,
i
would
not
say
my
position
is
like
the
consumer
at
all.
i
said
that
permanent
certificates
are
available
use
them.
and
then
look
to
the
current
--
for
the
current
conditions
in
the
market.
you
may
look
to
the
temporary
certificates
and
see
if
they
buttress
your
determination
of
the
in-line
price
by
using
permanent
certificates.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
in
the
callery
case,
they
were
lowered.
and
in
south
louisiana,
they
found
for
successive
periods
that
from
1958,
the
average
weighted
price
in
fact
had
gone
down
but
nevertheless
in
their
own
discretion
and
this
court
proved
it
found
the
20-cent
price
to
continue
for
the
in-line
price
determination
despite
the
fact
that
subsequent
to
1958
average
weight
of
price
determinations
resulted
in
lower
weighted
prices.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
i
agree
with
the
commission
discretion
that
they
feel
that
the
permanent
certificates
show
a
change
downward
nevertheless
they
may
find
the
line
continuous
because
of
skimpy
permanent
certificates
that
are
available
in
the
post
statement
period.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
oh,
very
much
so.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
very
much
so.
we
made
offers
approved
to
show
on
company
wide
cost
service
and
what
not
to
try
and
get
in
before
the
commission
and
that
was
denied,
and
callery
approved
that.
very
much
so
we
would
deny
the
holdings
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
the
law
and
commission
policy
is
clear
that
where
there
is
any
objection
to
a
proposed
settlement,
there
is
in
fact
no
settlement
to
consider.
the
prices
reflect
what
all
of
these
parties
believed
to
be
the
in-line
price
at
that
time.
that
they've
considered
such
sales
in
the
average
weight
of
price
is
in
error.
the
examiner
categorized
these
settlements
as
other
than
permanent
certificates.
the
settlements
are
obviously
permanent
certificates
and
worthy
of
as
it
is
as
much
weight
in
the
price
line
review
as
a
contested
permanent
certificate.
full
consideration
of
these
settlement
orders
raises
the
average
weighted
price
to
0.63
cents
per
mcf
above
the
average
weighted
price
of
opinion
475
below.
the
full
consideration
of
all
non-suspect
permanent
certificates
in
railroad
district
3
for
the
pre-statement
period,
raises
the
average
weighted
prices
at
16.95
cents
per
mcf.
mr.
justice
fortas
and
this
is
my
final
point,
i
just
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
here,
and
you
ask
the
question
yesterday
whether
or
not,
there
are
no
permanent
certificates
involved
in
this
proceeding.
superior
believed
they
had
a
permanent
certificate.
in
september
of
1960,
we're
issued
an
unconditioned
permanent
certificate
at
17.5
cents
per
mcf.
we
held
that
certificate
for
over
one
year
and
the
only
condition
--
i
take
it
back,
there
was
one
small
condition
and
it
said
that
this
is
conditioned
to
the
acceptance
of
a
permanent
certificate
by
florida
gas
transmission,
the
pipeline
purchaser.
in
august
of
1961,
a
permanent
certificate
was
issued
and
the
same
time,
the
commission
came
out
of
an
order
resending
our
permanent
certificate,
at
17.5
cents,
gave
us
an
unconditioned
temporary
certificate
at
17.5
cents.
so
we
now
look
in
1968
to
a
situation
where
we
find
the
commission
may
file
a
16-cent
price
with
refunds,
with
interests
of
believing
in
1958
that
we
had
a
permanent
unconditioned
certificate.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
killbourne,
the
counsel
for
the
superior
oil
company,
petitioner
number
231.
superior
is
the
only
party
to
these
consolidated
proceedings
that
has
thought
to
review
on
the
price
findings
of
the
commission
as
well
as
the
court
position
below,
due
to
a
15-minute
time
restriction,
i
shall
limit
my
comments
to
two
areas
dealing
with
the
construction
of
the
initial
in-line
price
for
the
period
1958
to
1960.
i
refer
you
to
a
full
discussion
of
superior's
position
on
our
initial
brief
in
reply
briefs
filed
previously
with
this
court.
the
commission
opinion
475
concluded
that
the
proper
initial
certificate
price
for
producer
applicants
in
texas
railroad
commission
district
number
3
for
the
period
prior
september
28,
1960
was
16
cents
per
mcf.
superior
challenges
this
conclusion
and
the
findings
there
under
for
the
reason
that
the
commission
refused
to
consider
all
the
record
evidence.
specifically,
the
superior's
protest
is
the
commission's
refusal
to
include
all
high
volume,
non-suspect
permanent
certificates
and
a
computation
of
the
average
weighted
price
used
by
this
commission
to
ultimately
determine
the
in-line
price
for
such
period
this
court's
catco
decision
in
1959
helped
delay
of
the
commission
in
determining
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
required
a
most
careful
scrutiny
of
initial
price
proposals
of
the
producers
under
section
7.
this
commission
has
since
developed
the
in-line
price
technique
to
meet
this
duty
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
ninth
circuit
is
now
famous
as
ugi
case
on
which
the
commission
so
heavily
relies
considered
the
in-line
price
technique
to
be
a
simple,
direct,
and
effective
device
on
which
to
determine
the
in-line
price.
callery
said
the
proper
and
only
evidence
necessary
to
establish
a
price
line
can
allow
a
proper
evaluation
of
all
factors
bearing
on
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
was
a
field
price
study.
this
court
in
callery
held
that
adequate
consumer
protection
under
section
7
was
attained
through
the
utilization
of
the
in-line
price
technique
and
the
related
suspect
price
doctrine.
this
court
in
callery
approved
a
certification
of
applications
of
the
highest
price
level
after
elimination
of
suspect
prices.
prices
tainted
by
the
erroneously
issued
and
remanded
catco
certificates
were
set
aside.
only
prices
then
subject
to
court
and
commission
review
as
well
as
like
prices
in
the
same
area
not
currently
under
review
will
regard
as
suspect.
the
general
concept
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine
that
is
prices
still
subject
to
commission
in
court
review
was
urged
by
the
commission
and
approved
by
this
court
in
callery.
and
it
is
now
urged
in
the
commission's
initial
brief
in
this
proceeding.
it
is
a
distorted
application
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine
that
causes
the
commission
to
commit
legal
error
in
the
record
below
and
not
the
definition
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
justice
harlan
concurring
in
the
line
determination
in
callery,
said
the
in-line
price
was
comparatively
easy
to
fix.
his
statement
is
correct
but
i
would
submit
that
if
the
fixing
of
the
line
is
done
improperly,
then
the
whole
purpose
of
the
stock
gas
measure
is
blunted.
mr.
justice
harlan
also
expressed
great
concern
for
the
use
of
a
crooked
measuring
rod
derived
from
a
too
broad
application
of
the
suspect
price
doctrine.
that
would
result
in
too
lower
price
line.
the
producer
and
consumer
are
permanently
injured
by
the
uncertainty
and
the
price
instability,
the
results
from
unduly
low
price
line.
the
line
determination
is
an
artificial
approach.
and
although
mechanically
easy
to
compute,
the
commission
must
make
full
use
of
the
proper
inputs
to
arrive
at
a
proper
place
line.
the
commission
has
totally
ignored
nine
final
non-suspect
20-cent
permanent
certificates
and
six
other
large
volume
final
non-suspect
permanent
certificates.
the
commission
opinion
475
acknowledged
the
charismatic
impact
for
this
nine
20
cents
sales,
certificated
in
1959
the
trunkline
gas
company.
but
stated
or
eliminated
from
the
weighted
average
price
determination
because
such
elimination
was
consistent
with
an
earlier
district
3
certificate
proceeding,
texaco
seaboard
opinion
383
to
which
superior
was
not
a
party
and
to
which
no
appeal
was
ever
taken.
the
only
reason
given
by
the
commission
for
eliminating
these
sales
was
that
six
of
the
nine
20-cent
sales
would
have
been
set
aside
on
the
new
york
public
service
commission's
petition
for
review
of
a
commission
ordered
denying
intervention
but
for
the
failure
to
prefect
their
appeal.

mr.

mr.
johnson
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
he's
representing
clients
from
both
districts.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
there
were
some
producers
who
accepted
the
in-line
price
determination
of
the
commission
who
never
sought
any
appeal
whatsoever.
there
were
some
producers
who
sought
review
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
and
that
accepted
--
mr.
william
t.

court

the
in-line
determination
of
the
commission
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
that's
correct.
the
fact
remains
at
the
trunkline
sales
were
certificated
a
20-cent
permanent
certificate
rate
after
a
full
hearing
in
which
producer
hawkins,
the
commission
staff
and
16
interveners
including
the
michigan
public
service
commission,
the
state
of
intended
consumption
of
the
gas
had
fully
participated,
briefs
exceptions
to
the
examiner's
decision
and
applications
for
rehearing
were
filed.
oral
argument
was
held
before
the
commission
in
a
fully
considered
opinion
issuing
permanent
certificates
at
20
cents
was
issued.
clearly
there
was
no
price
infirmity
resulting
from
the
commission
order.
the
public
service
commission
filed
knows
of
intervention
in
that
proceeding
as
provided
for
in
the
rules
of
the
commission.
in
line
with
the
established
commission
policy
at
that
time,
the
commission
found
that
a
denial
of
intervention
was
required
because
allegations
of
the
would-be
intervener,
the
public
service
commission,
failed
to
show
a
direct
or
immediate
interest
to
justify
their
intervention
as
a
matter
of
right.
however,
in
deference
to
public
service
commission
it
was
offered
the
status
of
a
limited
participant
in
the
proceeding
to
show
to
the
examiner
that
the
public
service
commission
had
a
sufficient
interest
and
that
its
intervention
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
the
public
service
commission
elected
not
to
exercise
this
right
of
limited
participation
and
made
no
appearance
in
the
proceeding.
subsequently,
an
order
was
issued
denying
intervention
and
the
public
service
commission's
petition
for
review
with
that
order
denying
intervention
was
dismissed.
the
failure
to
perfect
the
petition
for
review
whether
the
intervention
in
hindsight
was
proper
or
not
is
no
more
failed
to
the
correctness
of
the
trunkline
opinion
in
the
20-cent
certificate
therein,
then
would
be
the
producers
fair
to
brief
and
argue
the
in-line
issue
and
the
callery
case
suggest
that
the
callery
case
is
wrong.
both
decisions
must
be
taken
as
correct
and
they
have
an
impact
on
this
proceeding
here.
the
20-cent
sales
became
final
after
the
judicial
review
and
are
taking
place
to
this
date.
clearly,
they
were
not
erroneously
issued.
no
action
has
been
taken
to
modify
them
to
any
individual
section
5
(a)
complaint
proceeding,
which
maybe
initiated
either
by
the
commission
or
by
any
producer,
distributor,
or
party
agreed.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
thank
you.
we
were
talking
before
the
luncheon
break
about
the
commission
action
eliminating
certain
permanent
non-suspect
certificates.
and
the
method
the
commission
selected
to
hold
the
line
is
the
in-line
method
approved
by
this
court
in
callery.
and
the
commission
consistently
states
that
the
in-line
price
is
derived
from
a
review
of
only
permanent
non-suspect
certificates
when
available.
then
superior
insists
that
every
comparable
permanent
certificate,
not
classified
suspect
under
the
suspect
price
doctrine,
be
included
in
that
determination.
the
commission
has
selected
the
method
and
it
is
under
a
legal
obligation
to
apply
it
consistently.
the
commission
cannot
be
allowed
to
pick
and
choose
among
otherwise
helpful
permanent
certificates
no
longer
subject
to
review
in
order
to
find
the
price
line.
the
error
of
citing
texaco
seaboard
has
authority
to
disregard
these
sales
must
not
be
allowed
to
result
in
unduly
low
price
line.
full
consideration
of
these
sales
raises
the
average
weighted
price
to
16.92
cents
per
mcf.
opinion
475
has
done
a
weight
average
place
for
the
period
involved
of
15.16
cents
per
mcf.
the
fixing
of
the
in-line
price
at
the
highest
level
of
prices
after
elimination
of
property
suspect
prices
were
at
some
level
between
the
weighted
average
price
of
16.92
cents
and
20
cents
would
result
in
a
price
line
that
would
justify
superior's
sale
in
this
proceeding.
the
commission
committed
further
error
in
refusing
to
use
six
permanent
certificates
issued
by
the
commission
under
settlement
orders.
the
prices
of
these
file
certificates
ranged
from
16
to
18
cents
per
mcf
and
would
have
a
clearly
upward
impact
on
the
average
weighted
price.
the
commission
has
made
an
express
finding
that
such
certificates
resulted
from
settlements
are
required
by
the
public
interest.
the
certificates
result
from
proposals
or
producers
concurred
in
by
regulatory
bodies,
distribution
companies,
and
the
commission
to
accept
amended
price
levels
in
order
to
obtain
permanent
certificates
at
firm
prices
without
the
usual
administrative
delay.
the
purposes
that
motivated
the
parties
to
a
settlement
are
identical
with
the
purposes
of
the
producer
in
a
contested
certificate
proceeding.
whatever
the
reasons
for
seeking
a
settlement,
the
obligations
of
the
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act
are
unchanged.
it
may
not,
for
its
own
convenience,
issue
an
order
that
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
settlement
orders
specifically
find
that
the
prices
approved
by
the
commission
are
required
by
the
public
interest.
the
permanent
certificate
is
in
all
respect
final
and
beyond
review.
permanent
certificates
resulting
from
settlements
have
never
been
considered
erroneous
or
suspect.
in
addition,
settlements
represent
current
conditions
in
the
regulated
industry.
they
reflect
the
consider
judgment
not
only
the
commission
and
the
producer,
but
also
the
expressed
or
tacit
approval
of
the
distributors
and
the
regulatory
state
bodies
who
have
actively
participated
and
who
were
submitted
the
proposed
settlement
offered
before
the
commission
issued
it's
final
order.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
in-line
pricing,
where
permanent
certificates
are
available
to
rely
exclusively
on
permanent
certificates.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
that
is
my
position
also.
and
these
are
permanent
certificates
and
must
be
relied
on
by
the
commission
and
not
ignored.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
temporary
certificates
can
be
looked
to
determine
the
current
market
as
they've
done
in
the
callery
case
in
this
instance
so
the
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
i
would
refer
you
to
the
callery
case,
mr.
justice
white,
where
in
fact
--
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
no
sir.
no,
i
would
not
say
my
position
is
like
the
consumer
at
all.
i
said
that
permanent
certificates
are
available
use
them.
and
then
look
to
the
current
--
for
the
current
conditions
in
the
market.
you
may
look
to
the
temporary
certificates
and
see
if
they
buttress
your
determination
of
the
in-line
price
by
using
permanent
certificates.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
in
the
callery
case,
they
were
lowered.
and
in
south
louisiana,
they
found
for
successive
periods
that
from
1958,
the
average
weighted
price
in
fact
had
gone
down
but
nevertheless
in
their
own
discretion
and
this
court
proved
it
found
the
20-cent
price
to
continue
for
the
in-line
price
determination
despite
the
fact
that
subsequent
to
1958
average
weight
of
price
determinations
resulted
in
lower
weighted
prices.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
i
agree
with
the
commission
discretion
that
they
feel
that
the
permanent
certificates
show
a
change
downward
nevertheless
they
may
find
the
line
continuous
because
of
skimpy
permanent
certificates
that
are
available
in
the
post
statement
period.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
oh,
very
much
so.
mr.
william
t.
killbourne
very
much
so.
we
made
offers
approved
to
show
on
company
wide
cost
service
and
what
not
to
try
and
get
in
before
the
commission
and
that
was
denied,
and
callery
approved
that.
very
much
so
we
would
deny
the
holdings
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
the
law
and
commission
policy
is
clear
that
where
there
is
any
objection
to
a
proposed
settlement,
there
is
in
fact
no
settlement
to
consider.
the
prices
reflect
what
all
of
these
parties
believed
to
be
the
in-line
price
at
that
time.
that
they've
considered
such
sales
in
the
average
weight
of
price
is
in
error.
the
examiner
categorized
these
settlements
as
other
than
permanent
certificates.
the
settlements
are
obviously
permanent
certificates
and
worthy
of
as
it
is
as
much
weight
in
the
price
line
review
as
a
contested
permanent
certificate.
full
consideration
of
these
settlement
orders
raises
the
average
weighted
price
to
0.63
cents
per
mcf
above
the
average
weighted
price
of
opinion
475
below.
the
full
consideration
of
all
non-suspect
permanent
certificates
in
railroad
district
3
for
the
pre-statement
period,
raises
the
average
weighted
prices
at
16.95
cents
per
mcf.
mr.
justice
fortas
and
this
is
my
final
point,
i
just
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
here,
and
you
ask
the
question
yesterday
whether
or
not,
there
are
no
permanent
certificates
involved
in
this
proceeding.
superior
believed
they
had
a
permanent
certificate.
in
september
of
1960,
we're
issued
an
unconditioned
permanent
certificate
at
17.5
cents
per
mcf.
we
held
that
certificate
for
over
one
year
and
the
only
condition
--
i
take
it
back,
there
was
one
small
condition
and
it
said
that
this
is
conditioned
to
the
acceptance
of
a
permanent
certificate
by
florida
gas
transmission,
the
pipeline
purchaser.
in
august
of
1961,
a
permanent
certificate
was
issued
and
the
same
time,
the
commission
came
out
of
an
order
resending
our
permanent
certificate,
at
17.5
cents,
gave
us
an
unconditioned
temporary
certificate
at
17.5
cents.
so
we
now
look
in
1968
to
a
situation
where
we
find
the
commission
may
file
a
16-cent
price
with
refunds,
with
interests
of
believing
in
1958
that
we
had
a
permanent
unconditioned
certificate.
thank
you.
