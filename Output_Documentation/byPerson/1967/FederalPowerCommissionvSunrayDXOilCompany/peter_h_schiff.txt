mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
group
of
cases
before
the
court
today
are
part
of
the
commission's
interim
program
for
determining
initial
certificate
prices
for
the
sales
by
independent
producers
of
natural
gas.
this
is
interim
awaiting
the
commission's
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
area
rate
proceedings.
under
this
interim
program
which
this
court
has
--
had
the
occasion
to
discuss
in
the
second
phillips
case
and
has
dealt
with
to
some
extent
in
the
callery
case
in
1965.
the
commission
building
on
another
decision
of
this
court
the
catco
case
which
was
decided
in
1959,
that
was
under
the
style
of
atlantic
refining
company
and
public
service
commission
of
new
york
has
been
using
its
conditioning
power
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
stabilize
prices,
producer
prices
or
in
the
words
of
this
court
to
attempt
to
hold
the
line.
as
an
early
part
of
this
interim
program,
the
commission
at
the
time
that
it
decided
the
second
phillips
case
that
is
the
case
where
it
concluded
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
of
independent
producers
should
be
determined
on
a
area
basis.
the
commission
promulgated
a
statement
of
general
policy
designating
23
pricing
areas
and
for
each
of
these
pricing
areas,
it
established
a
ceiling
price
above
which
the
commission
would
not
permit
gas
to
add
on
the
market
under
the
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
if
there
was
no
objection,
the
commission
would
issue
a
premise
certificate
at
those
prices.
if
there
were
objection,
the
commission
would
issue
temporary
certificates
if
the
proper
allegations
were
made
by
the
producers
and
requested
such
certificates.
these
ceilings
or
guidelines
as
they
have
been
referred
to
were
issued
in
september
of
1960.
and
while
some
of
these
guidelines
has
subsequently
been
adjusted
downward,
the
guidelines
themselves
did
clamp
a
lid
on
the
price
rise
that
have
been
generated
in
the
market.
during
the
same
general
period
of
time,
the
commission
in
attempting
to
apply
the
requirement
to
hold
line
commends
the
series
of
the
so-called
in-line
proceedings
and
the
case
is
there
before
the
court
now
fit
into
that
category.
the
commission
as
part
of
this
interim
program
has
had
more
than
25
proceedings
to
determine
the
appropriate
initial
certificate
price
for
producer
sales
and
these
are
related
to
13
pricing
areas.
as
a
result
of
this
program,
the
price
rise
as
i've
indicated
would
stop
and
the
program
as
mr.
solomon
told
you
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
argument
has
resulted
in
price
reductions
below
the
proposed
contract
levels
of
about
$134
million.
this
included
both
the
fully
adjudicated
cases
as
well
as
settlements
which
generally
followed
the
principles.
it
does
not
include
the
amounts
of
money
that
are
involved
in
these
cases.
the
--
essentially
the
in-line
program
that
i
have
described
should
be
viewed
as
being
in
the
past
tense
because
except
for
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
which
is
involved
here
and
the
south
louisiana
area,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
appropriate
initial
certificate
price
and
the
price
question
at
least
poses
no
barrier
to
the
issuance
of
permanent
certificates.
and
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
areas
and
in
the
south
louisiana
area,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
commission
will
not
conduct
further
in-line
proceedings
of
the
type
that
are
involved
here
but
that
instead
it
will
issue
the
--
as
it
had
issue
temporary
authorization
for
the
guideline
prices
and
then
determine
the
final
certificate
price
on
the
basis
of
the
just
and
reasonable
determination
to
be
made
in
the
pending
area
rate
proceedings.
now,
in
saying
this
i
do
not
wished
to
give
the
impression
that
this
case
is
of
no
consequence
because
indeed
the
resolution
of
the
series
of
conflicting
court
of
appeals'
decisions
will
determine
the
disposition
of
--
in
the
neighborhood
of
$20
to
$30
million.
the
present
group
of
cases
arise
from
three
different
commission
proceedings
relating
to
something
more
than
a
hundred
sales
by
independent
producers.
each
proceeding
related
to
one
of
the
pricing
areas
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
in
the
commission
for
these
purposes
has
followed
the
designations
of
areas
of
the
texas
railroad
commission.
so,
the
commission
had
a
separate
proceeding
for
texas
district
4
which
with
the
first
case
at
--
in
time
and
another
one
for
texas
district
number
2
and
a
third
one
for
texas
district
number
3.
and
the
cases
arise
from
two
different
courts
of
appeals.
the
first
one,
relating
the
so-called
amerada
case
comes
from
the
decisions
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
other
two
cases
which
have
been
generally
referred
to
by
the
courts
and
the
commission
as
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
cases
were
decided
at
the
--
at
one
time
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch,
these
cases
involved
about
hundred
sales
of
independent
producers
from
the
various
pricing
districts
on
--
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
the
sales
involved
were
all
contracted
for
during
the
period
from
about
1958
to
1963.
and
in
just
about
all
instances,
the
sales
commenced
under
a
temporary
authorizations
which
are
issued
on
the
basis
of
producer
allegations
of
emergency
and
without
any
notice
for
hearing.
the
--
for
the
period
prior
to
the
policy
statement
which
was
issued
in
september
1960,
the
temporary
in
some
instances
ranged
up
to
a
price
of
20
cents.
and
for
the
period
after
that,
there
were
no
prices
that
were
charged
although
there
are
some
higher
contracts
but
no
price
is
charged
at
above
the
18-cent
guideline
price
level.
in
the
first
of
the
three
proceedings
that
is
here
which
is
known
as
--
was
known
as
the
amerada
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
with
respect
to
which
--
there
are
two
volumes
of
the
joint
appendix,
numbers
1
and
2,
that
case
involves
sales
in
texas
district
number
4
and
in
all
instances,
the
contracts
involved
were
executed
after
the
date
of
the
policy
statement
in
1960.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
policy
statement
guideline
was
18
cents.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
fixed
the
in-line
prize
at
16
cents
and
it
deferred
for
later
consideration
the
question
of
whether
it
should
order
of
refunds
with
the
respect
to
most
of
the
temporary
authorizations
involved
because
these
temporaries
did
not
have
an
expressed
warning
that
refunds
might
be
issued
in
connection
with
the
permanent
certificate.
the
reason
for
the
deferral
was
that
in
an
earlier
case,
the
commission
had
held
that
in
its
view
it
would
not
be
equitable
to
require
the
producers,
although
they
had
charged
excess
amounts
during
the
temporary
authorization
to
make
refunds,
simply
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
expressed
warning
of
this
possibility.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
in
the
case
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
the
skelly
case
decided
that
the
commission
in
those
circumstances
would
as
the
commission
itself
believed
have
the
power
to
order
refunds
and
that
in
addition,
the
--
in
its
view,
the
commission
had
not
adequately
considered
the
equitable
factors
relating
to
refunds.
this
decision
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
just
about
two
month
before
the
commission's
decision
in
amerada
and
since
the
court
had
told
the
commission
that
it
should
give
more
penetrating
analysis
of
the
equitable
considerations,
the
commission
followed
that
same
course
here.
on
review,
the
tenth
circuit
stating
its
view
that
the
commission
would
have
no
power
to
order
any
refunds
in
these
circumstances
said
that
the
commission
had
erred
in
deferring
the
refund
question.
but
it
did
find
that
the
commission's
determination
of
the
16-cent
in-line
price
was
properly
supported.
in
so
doing,
it
rejected
tax
by
producers
that
this
16-cent
price
was
too
low
and
also
the
contentions
of
the
new
york
commission
and
various
eastern
distributors
whom
we
have
referred
to
as
the
“seaboard
interests”
collectively,
their
contentions
that
the
line
should
have
been
no
more
than
15
cents.
during
the
pendency
of
the
tenth
circuit
proceedings,
the
commission
in
fact
concluded
the
deferred
refund
proceeding
and
held
that,
with
very
limited
exceptions,
the
producers
as
an
equitable
matter
should
make
refunds
of
all
the
amounts
in
excess
of
the
16-cent
in-line
price
that
the
commission
had
determined.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
think
in
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
these
very
cases
and
on
--
i
think
the
order
is
in
early
1963,
the
commission
had
denied
a
request
by
the
some
of
the
interveners
to
impose
a
condition
for
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
--
well
i
--
i
believe
that
even
--
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
white,
in
these
cases
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
commission
in
effect
in
that
order
was
saying
that
we
have
previously
expressed
our
views
in
the
skelly
case
that
it
would
not
be
equitable
to
order
refunds
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
condition,
and
we
don't
think
that
we
should
change
the
nature
or
the
condition
after
the
service
under
the
temporary
had
already
commenced.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
now
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
there's
no
question,
but
that
was
what
the
commission
was
saying.
even
though
there
is
some
language
in
the
--
in
all
of
these
temporary
authorizations
which
said
that
the
grant
of
the
temporary
authorization
with
--
is
without
prejudice
to
the
final
disposition
of
the
rate
questions
and
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
--
well,
that
it
would
have
the
power
to
say,
“we
will
not
order
refunds”
i
think
the
thrust
of
these
--
the
opinions
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
of
the
d.c.
and
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
at
least
in
the
present
circumstances,
in
the
way
these
temporaries
are
issued
without
any
notice
are
--
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
producers
who
are
claiming
that
they
--
they
have
to
flare
their
gas
that
their
gas
maybe
drained,
these
are
their
own
representations
of
emergency.
i
think
in
these
circumstances
that
the
--
it
is
implicit
in
our
decision
that
in
these
circumstances,
we
cannot
impose
--
we
can't
relieve
the
producers
of
a
refund
obligation.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
commission
was
--
before
that
had
never
--
has
never
said
it
could
not
order
refunds
even
in
those
circumstances.
well,
let
me
--
if
i
may
describe
the
problem
that
arose
or
the
situation
that
developed.
the
commission
in
some
instances,
in
issuing
these
temporary
authorizations
did
impose
express
refund
conditions
and
in
others
it
did
not
impose
expressed
refund
conditions.
in
1959,
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
sunray
case
set
aside
the
commission
temporary
authorization
where
the
commission
had
imposed
a
refund
obligation.
and
it
said,
it
decided
on
the
ground
that
the
obligation
was
too
indefinite
because
the
commission
said
you
may
have
to
make
refunds
down
to
the
certificate
price
that
we
ultimately
determined.
and
the
tenth
circuit
seemed
to
take
the
view
that
the
commission
would
have
to
put
a
floor
in
on
any
refund
condition
that
it
might
impose.
thereafter,
the
commission
in
most
instances,
at
least
where
the
price
was
at
the
level
that
the
commission
viewed
to
be
the
appropriate
guideline
price
did
not
insert
any
refund
conditions
although
it
did
include
in
their
certificates
the
warning
that
this
price
is
--
or
these
temporaries
are
without
prejudice
to
what
the
commission
might
ultimately
do.
but
there
was
never
any
expressed
statement
by
the
commission
at
any
time
that
it
could
not
order
refunds
in
these
circumstances.
and
indeed
when
this
issue
was
first
decided,
i
think
in
the
skelly
case,
the
commission
said,
“we
don't
think
it
would
be
equitable
because
we
hadn't
given
you
notice”,
and
of
course
there
was
this
course
of
conduct
only
commission
which
--
the
commission
in
these
cases
has
acknowledges,
lead
the
producers
to
think
that
they
might
not
have
to
make
refunds.
but
we
don't
think
that
this
goes
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
order
refunds.
at
most,
we
think,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
equitable
to
require
them
to
make
refunds
and
that
before
the
producers
can
be
--
or
that
the
mere
fact
of
reliance
doesn't
prove
that
there
has
been
--
and
doesn't
even
show
that
there
has
been
any
detrimental
reliance
thereon.
on
the
other
hand,
the
consumers
for
whom
the
act
is
--
for
whose
protection
the
act
was
primarily
adopted
have
had
no
notice
before
these
temporaries
are
even
issued.
now,
in
that
respect,
at
the
time
of
this
february
5th
order,
justice
white,
the
temporaries
had
already
been
issued,
the
service
had
already
commenced.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
asked
that
prospectively
that
there'd
be
a
refund
condition
imposed
and
the
commission
adhering
to
its
view
in
the
skelly
case
that
no,
we
don't
think
we
should
change
it.
but,
this
wouldn't
have
given
the
producers
the
option,
for
example
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
said
in
sunray,
they
should
have
by
being
able
to
reject
the
certificate
if
they
didn't
like
the
terms
and
conditions.
we
would
merely
have
been
putting
in
something
supplemental
and
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
that
the
commission's
grant
or
denial
of
the
motion
would
have
very
much
legal
significance.
if
the
commission
had
granted
the
--
had
modified
it,
of
course
i
think
it
would
have
cutoff
any
equitable
argument
that
the
producer
should
thereafter
not
have
to
make
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
that
is
certainly
true.
that
in
light
of
the
--
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
that
is
very,
very
much
so.
but
then,
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
story
of
all
of
everything
in
these
in-line
proceedings
that's
been
a
constant
course
of
commission
decisions
and
approval
by
the
court
in
some
instance,
disapproval
and
as
these
cases
as
well
as
two
other
cases
which
are
pending
on
certiorari
petitions
that
this
point
show
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
totally
at
odds
with
each
other
and
in
some
instance
with
the
commission
and
obviously
in
others
is
not.
the
--
i
think
as
long
as
i
have
been
discussing
the
refund
issue
to
this
extent,
i
will
proceed
with
that
and
connote
that
in
the
other
two
cases
involved
here,
involving
the
other
two
districts
and
the
one
which
came
up
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
refund
question
except
to
say
that
the
deferral
of
the
refund
question
there
was
appropriate.
and
i
will
get
back
to
those
in
discussing
the
issues
on
the
merits.
in
our
view,
the
--
we
believe
that
the
commission's
power
to
order
refunds
in
this
case
is
very
much
the
same
issue
that
this
court
decided
in
1965
in
the
callery
case.
in
the
callery
case,
the
commission
had
originally
issued
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
at
the
level
of
about
22
cents
and
above.
this
was
the
level
which
had
been
disapproved
in
the
earlier
catco
case.
the
commission's
decisions
in
these
cases
were
set
aside
both
by
summary
reversal
in
one
instance
by
this
court
and
by
a
series
a
court
of
appeals
decisions
holding
that
the
commission
hadn't
adequately
considered
the
price
question.
on
remand
from
those
cases,
the
commission
found
that
the
appropriate
in-line
price
was
20
cents.
however,
in
the
meantime,
the
producers
had
been
selling
their
gas
under
these
permanent
certificates
they
had
started
after
the
hearing
and
after
the
certificate
order.
but
with
knowledge
that
there
was
going
to
be
court
review
or
that
it
had
not
in
fact
been
instituted.
there
was
no
condition
inserted
or
given
by
either
the
commission
or
the
courts
prior
to
the
time
that
they
commend
service.
the
commission
ordered
the
refunds
down
to
the
price
ultimately
found
to
be
the
appropriate
in-line
price.
it
was
argued
in
that
case
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
because
we
lack
reparations
authority.
the
court
held,
however,
in
agreeing
with
the
commission
that
the
lack
or
reparations
authority
does
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
the
order
under
which
rates
are
collected
is
in
itself
not
a
final
order.
now,
in
callery,
it
is
true
that
the
order
was
subject
to
court
review.
in
this
instance,
we
do
not
believe
that
these
temporary
authorizations
which
are
issued
on
ex
parte
basis
on
the
basis
of
producer
representations
of
emergency
without
any
notice
or
hearing
and
without
any
realistic
opportunity
to
obtain
court
review
that
the
temporaries
have
any
greater
claim
to
finality
than
did
the
certificates
under
which
service
was
rendered
in
the
cases
involved
in
the
callery
case.
if
anything,
there's
even
less
claim
to
finality
here.
the
argument
which
seems
to
the
contrary
that
is
pressed
is
of
temporary
authorizations
can
be
reviewed.
and
of
course,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
temporaries
have
been
reviewed
and
generally,
at
the
instance
of
the
producers
themselves
whether
not
been
satisfied
with
the
condition
--
price
reduction
conditions
or
other
conditions
that
the
commission
has
imposed.
there
has
been
one
instance
where
the
new
york
commission
obtained
review
of
temporary
authorizations.
its
challenge
was
principally
that
we
had
no
power
to
issue
temporary
authorizations
at
all.
the
new
york
commend
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
sustained
the
commission's
power
to
issue
temporary
authorizations,
it
indicated
that
it
if
temporaries
were
going
to
achieve
the
objective
that
they
were
intended
to,
of
permitting
a
producer
to
start
service
quickly
because
of
these
emergencies
that
do
exist
in
the
field
and
basically
they're
economic
emergencies,
that
there
could
be
no
comprehensive
review
of
a
temporary
authorization.
and
of
course,
there
is
no
actual
notice
or
any
formal
notice
to
the
--
any
of
the
distributors.
if
they
are
careful
and
keep
tabs
of
what's
going
on
in
the
public
information
office
at
the
commission,
there
is
narrow
file,
i
don't
know
when
they
started
which
shows
the
temporaries
that
are
issued,
but
there
is
no
notice
to
them.
there
is
no
opportunity
to
object.
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
review,
the
whole
purpose
of
temporaries
could
not
be
achieved.
to
give
finality
to
the
temporaries,
we
suggest,
would
convert
them
into
a
limited
term
permanent
certificates
without
any
real
scrutiny
of
the
--
of
them
in
light
of
the
public
interest
and
we
believe
that
the
callery
decision
as
to
the
power
of
the
commission
is
fully
controlling.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
it's
possible.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
in-line
price
being
the
price
which
has
been
permanently
certificated,
my
answer
is
no.
that
would
then
be
a
firm
price
which
the
commission
would
not
--
it
couldn't
go
back
for
the
at
least
the
period
prior
to
the
initiation
of
a
--
of
an
increased
rate
proceeding.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
commission's
rate
powers
are
under
section
5,
there
are
two
determinant
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
charged
thereafter.
under
section
4,
the
commission
has
a
power
to
order
refunds
from
the
time
that
a
rate
become
--
goes
into
effect
subject
to
--
to
refund.
the
--
to
order
refunds
for
the
period
prior
that
time
would
under
the
cases
where
there
has
been
a
final
commission
decision
be
regarded
as
reparations
which
this
court
in
cases
relating
both
to
the
federal
power
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
has
indicated
that
the
commission
has
no
reparations
authority
which
is
derived
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
well.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
let's
had
--
the
company
would
have
had
temporary
authorization
and
then
we
would
fix
the
in-line
price
which
would
be
the
permanent
certificate
price.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
do
under
the
orders
which
the
commission
has
issued
and
which
are
under
review.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
the
power
that
we
--
to
refund
that
we
exercised
in
this
case
was
at
the
time
that
we
issued
the
permanent
certificates
in
these
cases,
we
said
that
you
should
make
refunds
for
the
period
of
time
during
which
you
are
collecting
and
selling
under
your
temporary
authorization.
we
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
once
a
permanent
certificate
is
at
least
finally
approved
by
the
courts,
the
power
to
issue
--
to
go
behind
that
rate
ceases.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
unless
we
reserve
some
power
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
except
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
the
permanent
cert
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
i'm
sure
that
we
can,
in
the
permanent
certificate
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
on
the
permanent
certificate
--
well
there
have
been
some
--
and
not
in
the
producer
cases.
we
have
imposed
some
price
conditions
even
on
permanent
certificates
especially
pipelines
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
but
this
is
subject
to
future
revision.
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
the
specific
kind
of
condition
that
you
mentioned,
no.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
i'm
--
as
i
indicated
that
the
--
we
think
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
plainly
incorrect
in
finding
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
on
grounds
of
finality.
the
tenth
circuit
although
it
alleged
not
to
pass
on
the
equities
of
the
situation,
also
held
in
saying
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refund.
it
said
that
in
its
view
for
the
good
of
the
public,
the
consumers,
the
distributors,
the
pipelines
and
the
producers,
certainty
and
stability
are
prime
importance.
and
it
also
stated
in
its
opinion
that
the
repricing
of
gas
without
warning
cannot
help
but
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
operations
of
the
producer.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
factors
to
the
extent,
they
are
relevant
as
to
whether
refunds
should
be
required
or
not,
relate
not
to
the
commission's
power
but
to
the
--
the
equities
of
the
circumstances.
and
that
this
is
a
question
which
the
commission
should
be
allowed
to
pass
on
in
the
first
instance
and
which
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
did
pass
on
in
the
separate
proceeding.
and
at
that
time,
the
producers
in
the
commission's
view
made
no
showing
of
being
harmed
by
not
having
had
notice
of
the
refund
condition.
the
commission
assumed
that
they
could
properly
--
had
properly
relied
on
the
commission's
own
course
of
conduct
in
the
thinking
that
they
would
not
make
refunds.
but
the
commission
found
that
there
were
only
two
situations
where
the
producers
had
shown
harm.
one
was
that
the
producers
had
paid
out
royalties
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
the
in-line
price
and
the
higher
price
being
collected.
and
it
appeared
that
even
if
these
royalties
--
this
amount
could
be
recouped
from
the
royalty
owners,
that
the
practicalities
of
such
recoupment
would
be
prohibitive.
it
also
appeared
that
in
some
instances
it
might
not
be
possible
to
recover
state
production
taxes
paid
to
the
state
of
texas
although
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
setoff
where
they
were
continuing
sales
to
the
extent
that
such
setoff
was
not
possible,
the
commission
held
that
producers
should
be
relieved
of
any
obligation
to
make
refunds
as
to
those
amounts.
in
fact,
these
amounts
are
less
than
the
--
or
probably
about
an
eighth
of
the
total
amount
that
of
the
excess
collections.
other
than
that,
there
were
various
allegations
by
the
producers
that
the
--
their
financial
stability
would
be
affected
and
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
order
refunds
because
of
the
adverse
effects
on
budgeting
and
planning.
and
in
the
commission's
view,
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
in
reliance
on
the
transitory
nature
of
these
temporaries,
that
any
real
long-range
commitments
could
be
made
with
respect
to
--
on
that
basis.
it
also
did
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
refund
themselves,
would
have
any
significant
impact
on
the
operation
of
producers.
however,
it
did
recognized
expressly
in
another
case
which
came
out
about
the
same
time
is
these,
that
if
a
producer
could
demonstrate
that
by
making
a
large
refund,
the
smaller
producer
would
have
to
make
a
large
refund
and
that
this
would
cause
him
serious
present
difficulties,
that
the
commission
would
permit
this
to
be
refunded
over
a
period
of
time,
that
it
had
no
intention
or
desire
to
use
the
refunding
process
to
put
any
company
into
bankruptcy
or
other
dire
restraints.
but
unless
this
was
shown
which
hasn't
been
shown
at
any
of
the
cases
at
the
dockets
before
this
court,
the
commission
felt
that
this
did
not
provide
a
reason
for
excusing
the
refunds
or
the
excess
amounts
collected
when
if
judged
in
the
context
that
the
consumers
during
this
period
of
time
have
been
paying
excess
amounts
of
money.
the
--
i
do
wished
to
urge,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
pass
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
assessment
of
the
equities
because
in
its
view,
the
commission
simply
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
and
the
assessment
of
the
equities
came
up
in
a
second
proceeding.
we
have
urged
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
that
the
court
decide
this
issue
now
even
though
the
tenth
circuit
has
not
passed
on
it.
i
suggest
that
this
is
especially
appropriate
because
this
question
of
power
as
viewed
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
question
of
the
equities
seems
to
be
closely
interrelated.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
our
estimate
is
that
for
the
period
prior
to
the
commission's
order
or
orders,
not
just
here
but
also
in
--
on
the
cases
relating
the
south
louisiana
and
another
case
involving
the
texas
gulf
coast,
both
of
which
are
the
cases
are
pending
on
certiorari
petitions,
that
under
the
commission's
order,
the
refund
obligations
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$10
million,
this
would
be
increased
perhaps
by
an
equivalent
amount
but
i
think
by
somewhat
less
depending
on
the
disposition
of
the
price
question.
and
i'd
like
--
i'd
now
liked
to
turn
to
the
price
level
question.
i've
indicated
that
the
tenth
circuit
sustained
the
commission's
determination
of
16-cent
in-line
price.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
dealing
with
the
proceedings
coming
up
from
the
two
other
texas
gulf
coast
areas
thought
that
the
commission's
--
in
both
of
those
areas,
the
commission
had
sales
relating
both
to
the
period
before
the
policy
statement
and
for
the
period
after
the
policy
statement.
for
the
pre-policy
statement
period
in
texas
district
2,
it
found
an
in-line
price
of
15
cents
which
is
not
the
issue
here
are
at
all.
and
for
the
periods
subsequent
to
the
policy
statement
for
that
area,
it's
on
the
16-cent
in-line
price.
this
is
challenged
by
the
“seaboard
interests”
and
the
commission's
decision
in
this
respect
that
were
set
aside
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
similarly,
in
the
texas
district
3
which
is
the
part
of
the
gulf
coast
which
is
adjacent
to
south
louisiana,
the
commission
found
a
16-cent
pre-policy
statement
in-line
price
which
i
may
say
was
in
reaffirmance
of
earlier
decisions
on
this
point.
that
price
is
challenged
by
the
superior
oil
companies
being
too
low.
and
for
the
post-policy
statement
period,
the
commission
found
an
in-line
price
of
17
cents
which
is
challenged
by
the
“seaboard
interest”
as
being
too
high
and
by
the
superior
oil
company
as
being
too
low.
the
question
of
price
is
as
the
commission
has
recognized,
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
1959
in
the
callery
--
in
the
catco
case,
a
question
of
the
major
importance
in
our
producer
certificate
cases.
in
line
with
that
--
this
court's
decision,
however,
it's
been
recognized
that
the
determination
of
the
proper
price
at
which
sales
can
commence
should
be
done
in
a
expeditious
type
of
proceeding
and
not
in
a
just
and
reasonable
--
not
as
in
a
case
involving
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
--
the
objective
is
to
--
if
the
price
is
too
high
is
to
reduce
it
quickly
pending
further
consideration
of
what
the
just
and
reasonable
price
may
be.
so
the
problem
faced
in
these
cases
is
how
to
determine
the
price
line
for
the
interim
period
that
is
fair
and
reasonable
while
avoiding
protracted
proceedings
that
necessarily
accompany
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
commission
has
utilized
a
in-line
pricing
approach
which
was
fashioned
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
teachings
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
united
gas
improvement
company
against
federal
power
commission
which
was
decided
in
1960
and
has
been
--
was
at
that
time
followed
by
three
other
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
that
case
pretty
well
sets
forth
the
standards
have
been
followed.
there
the
ninth
circuit
stated
that
the
price
line
is
intended
to
reflect
current
conditions
in
the
industry.
therefore,
comparable
prices
upon
which
it
is
based
must
be
prices
under
which
a
substantial
amount
of
natural
gas
presently
moves
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
all
the
court
cases
since
that
time
with
the
exception
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
this
case,
including
this
court
in
callery
have
recognized
that
this
in-line
price
should
reflect
current
market
conditions.
at
the
same
time,
the
ninth
circuit
in
what
is
referred
to
as
the
ugi
case
held
that
the
commission
could
not
simply
look
at
the
prices
--
contemporaneous
prices
at
--
in
the
area
without
recognizing
that
some
of
those
prices
were
in
itself
the
result
of
improper
commission
action.
but
specifically,
what
had
occurred
in
the
ugi
cases
was
that
the
commission
had
approved
22-cent
prices
in
a
very
--
in
various
prior
proceedings
and
then
it
looked
at
those
prices
to
approve
the
price
involved
in
that
case.
but
the
earlier
22-cent
prices
had
all
resulted
and
had
all
leapfrogged
up
to
that
level
because
of
the
commission's
improper
decision
in
the
catco
case
where
it
had
approved
price
of
about
21-and-a-half
cents
even
though
before
that
time,
all
the
prices
in
the
area
was
substantially
less.
so
in
the
ugi
case,
the
court
formulated
what's
been
known
as
the
suspect
price
stock
during
that
the
commission
cannot
simply
simply
accept
its
face
value
prices
which
appeared
to
have
leapfrogged
as
result
of
prior
commission
errors.
but
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
also
rejected
a
contention
by
the
distributor
groups
that
the
commission
couldn't
consider
any
prices
other
than
those
which
had
received
full
commission
approval
in
a
--
in
a
adjudicated
hearing
type
of
case.
what
they
were
thinking
of
there
was
that
in
many
instances,
that
there
is
no
objection,
the
commission
will
issue
permanent
certificates
at
the
prices
that
it
deems
appropriate.
the
ninth
circuit
said
if
you
couldn't
look
at
any
of
those
prices,
you
would
simply
have
a
rollback
of
prices
because
there
would
might
not
be
any
substantial
volumes
of
gas
that
you
could
look
at
to
determine
what
the
current
market
conditions
were.
now,
following
the
ugi
cases,
the
commission
itself
never
treated
the
suspect
price
doctrine
as
the
case
which
precluded
the
commission
from
giving
any
effect
to
prices
which
had
not
been
finally
approved.
thus,
in
the
skelly
case
which
i've
referred
to
in
connection
in
one
of
the
refund
question,
the
commission
stated
that
it
had
given
some
or
be
it
discounted
way
to
temporary
authorizations.
but
until
the
cases
that
at
least
the
amerada
case
here
involved,
most
of
the
early
cases
there
had
in
fact
been
substantial
volumes
of
gas
that
had
moved
at
prices
that
near
the
--
near
the
line
that
commission
determined.
there
are
a
fair
number
of
non-suspected
prices.
in
amerada,
the
situation
was
quite
different,
only
about
90
--
about
90%
of
the
gas
in
the
area
during
the
period
of
time
covered
by
the
contracts
at
issue
was
flowing
under
temporary
certificates,
and
most
of
these
were
prices
from
16
to
18
cents.
there
were
a
few
prices,
few
sales
but
not
really
very
small
volumes
which
are
at
lower
prices.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
“seaboard
interests”
during
this
period
of
time
were
challenging
all
prices
above
the
14-and-a-half
to
15-cent
levels,
so
the
commission
foreclosed
from
issuing
permanent
certificates
and
a
situation
developed
where
the
commission
would
be
unable
to
make
any
assessment
of
current
conditions
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
prices
in
the
area.
because
no
substantial
volumes
of
gas
could
be
looked
at,
that
is
if
we
accepted
the
position
of
the
“seaboard
interests”.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
may
add
that
the
commission
with
the
approval
of
this
court
held
that
the
cost
evidence
should
not
be
considered
in
these
cases
because
that
would
simply
preclude
the
possibility
of
an
in-line
determination
before
the
just
and
reasonable
determination.
the
commission
did
not
in
these
circumstances
think
it
appropriate
to
ignore
temporary
authorizations
or
some
of
the
contract
prices.
but
it
took
a
middle
course,
it
looked
at
all
the
market
contract
price
evidence
in
the
area
and
it
carefully
examined
them.
it
looked
that
the
trends
between
the
period
before
the
policy
statement
and
the
period
after
the
policy
statement
and
it
discounted
the
effect
of
the
pricing
because
it
recognized
as
had
the
court
in
the
ugi
case
that
some
of
the
prices
in
the
area
were
obviously
the
result
of
market
distortions
stemming,
one,
from
the
fact
that
the
pipeline
cost
--
pipeline
purchases
are
have
--
have
imperfect
bargaining
motivations
to
keep
the
prices
down
and
secondly
that
there
had
been
some
commission
action
which
may
have
tended
to
move
up
prices.
so,
on
other
hand,
it
also
did
not
think
it
appropriate
to
base
its
in-line
determination
only
on
those
prices
to
which
the
consumer
interests
had
not
objected
because
if
it
had
done
that,
it
would
simply
have
been
rubberstamping
one
individual
parties
or
one
group
of
parties'
view
as
to
what
the
market
conditions
should
be.
and
in
the
commission's
view,
the
assessment
on
a
balance
basis
should
be
made
by
the
neutral
regulatory
agency
which
has
been
assigned
this
task
by
the
congress.

is

to
be

the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
holding
that
the
commission
had
improperly
looked
at
these
temporary
authorizations
in
two
of
the
areas
involved,
based
its
decision
in
good
part
on
the
view
that
current
market
conditions
were
simply
irrelevant
and
it
derived
that
interpretation
from
the
fact
that
in
this
court
in
callery
had
affirmed
the
exclusion
of
cost
in
economic
evidence.
but
it
overlooked
the
fact
that
that
exclusion
was
to
permit
the
--
was
for
administrative
purposes.
that
it
was
a
matter
of
administrative
necessity
that
the
commission
not
look
at
this
evidence
which
the
commission
itself
after
a
series
of
hearings
had
concluded
would
not
be
useful
unless
they
were
expanded
into
full
blown
rate
proceedings.
certainly
nothing
in
the
commission's
opinion
or
in
this
court's
opinion
in
callery
that
at
all
suggests
that
the
line
should
not
be
based
on
current
conditions.
to
the
contrary,
this
court's
opinion
in
callery
says
that
the
line
appropriately
relates
to
contemporaneous
sales
in
the
area.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
also
based
its
decision
in
part
on
the
fact
that
it
thought
that
they
would
--
that
even
though
they
might
be
a
freeze
in
the
line
under
its
view
which
it
recognized
that
there
might
be,
that
the
producers
would
be
protected
by
being
able
to
avail
themselves
of
the
right
to
file
increased
rates
after
the
date
of
the
commission's
order.
but
we
think
that
this
approach
of
the
court
relying
on
the
increased
rate
provisions
of
the
act
is
not
only
unfair
to
the
producers
for
reasons
that
i
believe
the
producer
counsels
will
explain
some
detail.
but
that
it
--
this
would
not
have
implemented
the
interests
of
the
consumer
in
the
best
way
possible
in
our
view.
the
one
purpose
of
in-line
pricing
was
to
discourage
the
filing
of
increased
rates.
and
the
commission
experienced
at
the
time
of
the
decisions
in
these
cases
was
that
if
the
commission
made
an
in-line
determination
which
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
reflect
market
conditions,
producers
would
not
file
for
increased
rates
thereafter
at
this
in-line
price.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
were
an
artificially
low
in-line
price,
predicated
solely
on
the
fact
that
increased
rates
could
be
filed
any
event,
there
were
the
substantial
chance
that
thereafter
there
would
be
increased
rate
filings
even
higher
levels.
and
of
course
those
would
be
passed
on
to
the
consumers
and
while
there
is
a
refund
remedy
under
the
act
and
while
we
think
this
is
useful,
this
court
has
repeatedly
agreed
with
us
that
the
protection
to
consumers
from
refunds
is
far
from
perfect.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
commission
in
these
--
making
these
various
in-line
determinations
recognized
that
it
could
not
simply
accept
the
contract
prices,
the
temporarily
certificated
prices
at
face
value.
this
had
been
the
voice
of
the
commission's
orders
in
the
ugi
cases
which
had
been
referred.
but
the
commission
in
these
cases
did
not
accept
them
at
face
value.
for
example,
in
amerada,
the
commission
found
that
the
weighted
contract
average
of
all
the
post-policy
statement
prices
was
about
17.2
cents
and
it
found
that
the
much
of
the
gas
was
flowing
up
--
at
prices
up
to
18
cents.
but
the
in-line
price
that
the
commission
determined
was
16
cents.
again,
in
texas
district
3
in
the
sinclair
case
which
i
may
say
is
likely
different
because
in
that
case,
there
were
in
fact
substantial
volumes
of
gas
and
the
majority
of
the
gas
was
flowing
under
permanent
certificates.
and
the
commission's
opinion
shows
on
its
face
that
the
commission
looked
principally
at
the
permanent
certificates.
now,
on
that
instance,
there
were
--
40%
of
the
gas
flowing
under
permanent
certificates
was
being
sold
at
18
cents.
new
york
or
the
“seaboard
interests”
suggest
that
this
18-cent
price
should
be
suspect
because
it
was
at
a
level
that
if
it
had
thought
about
it,
it
would
have
objected
too,
but
it
didn't
object
to
it
at
the
time
that
the
prices
were
approved.
yet,
the
commission
didn't
allow
an
18-cent
line
but
in
this
instance
it
allowed
a
17-cent
line.
in
the
case
where
the
evidence
showed
that
looking
solely
at
permanent
certificates,
the
weighted
average
price
from
the
period
before
the
issuance
of
the
policy
statement
to
the
period
after
the
issuance
of
the
policy
statement
had
risen
by
a
cent.
now,
there
is
one
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
on
these
cases
and
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
“seaboard
interests”
that
in
someway,
the
commission
has
applied
a
different
standards
in
the
cases
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast
from
the
standards
that
had
been
applied
in
cases
relating
to
south
louisiana.
and
the
basis
for
this
suggestion
is
that
in
south
louisiana,
the
commission
in
a
number
of
cases
has
found
that
the
line
which
was
originally
determined
for
the
period
at
which
the
sales
were
made
in
1956,
that's
the
catco
sale
of
20
cents,
has
not
changed
even
through
the
end
of
1962.
this
is
perfectly
true.
but
in
the
last
of
those
cases
which
was
called
the
union
texas
case
before
the
commission
and
the
pan
american
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
which
is
pending
here
on
the
refund
question
principally
and
also
on
one
price
element,
the
commission's
opinion
shows
that
the
commission
there
looked
at
temporary
authorizations.
it
compared
the
weighted
average
prices
under
permanent
certificates
from
--
to
the
--
in
the
different
years.
and
it
also
looked
and
examined
the
weighted
average
price
of
the
temporary
authorizations.
on
the
basis
of
its
analysis
of
the
fact
in
that
case,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
evidence
which
is
the
same
type
of
evidence
that
was
considered
here
simply
didn't
show
a
change
in
the
price
line.
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
it's
considered
appraisal
of
the
evidence
there
but
the
same
of
type
of
evidence
lead
it
to
a
different
result,
because
in
fact
there
it
concluded
that
the
price
line
for
the
periods
after
the
policy
statement
were
with,
in
each
of
the
three
areas,
they
sent
higher
than
the
price
line
that
it
had
determined
for
the
prior
period.
but
obviously,
a
different
result
resulting
from
a
reasonable
considered
assessment
of
the
record
in
each
case
doesn't
show
any
inconsistency.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
the
permian
basin
decision,
the
commission
said
that
the
--
it
would
use
the
just
and
reasonable
price
as
the
in-line
price.
but
also,
in
a
case
coming
from
the
permian
basin,
and
it's
pending
in
this
court
but
i
don't
remember
the
number.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
did
the
same
thing.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
it
--
in
the
commission's
view,
the
--
if
there
is
to
be
any
change
in
the
in-line
price,
it
will
have
to
be
by
showing
that
there
had
been
some
changes
in
the
factors
which
make
up
the
just
and
reasonable
determination.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
at
least
as
to
the
prospective
just
and
reasonable
price.
as
you
recall,
we
fixed
both
an
old
gas
price
and
the
new
gas
price
and
new
certificates
would
presumably
call
for
a
new
gas
price
which
might
be
adjusted.
but
that
is
what
the
commission
contemplates
doing
in
--
as
soon
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
determined.
and
in
this
case,
or
in
these
areas,
the
commission
is
no
longer
setting
down
anymore
in-line
proceedings
of
the
type
here
involved
because
the
just
and
reasonable
--
the
cases
involving
just
and
reasonable
rates
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast
and
south
louisiana
had
so
for
advance
that
it
would
seemed
to
be
the
wise
course
to
let
our
in-line
determination
rest
on
the
determination
in
those
area
rate
proceedings.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they
will
continue
in
effect
and
they
will
be
subject
to
refund.
in
part,
depending
on
this
court's
decision,
in
part
not,
the
--
all
the
sales
in
the
south
louisiana
area
since
about
the
middle
of
1964
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
express
refund
condition
and
since
early
1967,
all
temporaries
are
issued
with
a
refund
condition
which
has
a
floor
of
2
cents
below
either
the
guideline
price
or
the
in-line
price
whichever
is
lower.
and
the
commission
has
viewed
that
that
floor
would
be
certainly
--
would
tend
to
be
low
enough
not
to
pose
any
problems
thereafter.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
--
i
may
have
misspoken
myself
before
you,
but
i
think
that
question
before
related
to
refunds,
if
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
if
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
won't
order
further
refunds
in
the
cases
involved
here
because
those
sales
will
then
have
been
permanently
certificated.
in
the
texas
district
3
case,
the
superior
oil
company
makes
a
number
of
challenges
to
the
commission's
price
line
being
too
high
--
too
low,
excuse
me.
principally,
they
argue
that
we
should
have
relied
on
some
high-priced
gas
being
sold
at
20
cents.
as
to
that
argument,
the
commission
said
that
we
would
give
some
weight
to
those.
but
in
those
cases,
the
“seaboard
interests”
i
think
specifically
the
new
york
commission
had
been
denied
intervention
the
commission
proceedings,
it
then
went
to
court,
but
it
chose
the
wrong
the
time
to
challenge
its
exclusion
of
interventions
and
its
petition
for
review
was
dismissed
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
nevertheless,
it
was
apparent
to
the
commission
that
those
20-cent
prices
were
higher
than
the
commission
would
have
allowed
or
should've
allowed
at
that
time
that
what
before
this
procedural
clerk
it
would
not
have
been
allowed.
and
therefore
those
prices
should
certainly
not
betaken
as
reflecting
the
line,
in
other
words,
be
given
the
full
weight.
the
commission
gave
discounted
weight
to
that.
i
would
like
to
say
that
superior
has
mad
a
number
of
arguments
which
it
did
not
make
to
the
commission
and
it
has
suggested
in
its
reply
brief
but
these
arguments,
but
we
weren't
specific,
they
were
generally
encompassed
within
our
arguments.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
under
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
19
(b)
of
the
gas
act
which
requires
objections
not
--
requires
all
objections
that
to
be
raised
in
court
have
to
be
made
specifically
in
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
commission,
that
in
light
of
those
cases,
the
superior's
objections
may
not
be
considered.
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
objections
have
far
involved
in
a
few
other
cases
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
some
of
them
not
considering
low
price
sales,
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
fifth
circuit.
but
i
do
think
that
--
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
we
think
it's
important
that
parties
to
commission
cases
do
a
price
the
commission
specifically
of
the
objections
that
they
are
urging
so
that
the
commission
will
be
given
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
those
in
the
orders
on
rehearing
and
so
that
if
cases
do
come
to
court,
the
court
rather
than
being
asked
to
pass
on
questions
without
any
prior
commission
consideration,
that
it
have
the
commission's
consideration.
of
course
this
court
has
viewed
that
requirement
as
strict
statutory
bar
to
consideration
and
we
would
urge
that
that
interpretation
be
continued.
on
the
in-line
question,
finally,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
commission
recognized
that
it
had
a
very
difficult
evidentiary
problem.
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
evidence
that
it
had
to
consider
was
far
from
what
might
be
ideal
in
showing
current
market
conditions.
obviously,
it
did
not.
the
ideal
evidence
has
caused
an
economic
evidence
which
is
introduced
in
the
just
and
reasonable
cases
if
it
was
going
to
do
its
job,
it
couldn't
look
at
that.
but
we
suggest
that
the
commission
did
a
careful
reasonably
considered
assessment
of
the
evidence
at
hand
and
since
it
did
not
consider
materials
which
should
have
been
excluded,
we
request
that
the
commission's
in-line
determination
in
each
of
these
three
cases
--
commission
cases
be
sustained.
now
finally,
there
is
an
issue
in
the
two
cases
arising
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
this
is
the
issue
which
has
been
referred
to
as
the
question
of
need.
and
the
question
specifically
is
whether
the
commission
in
considering
each
independent
producer
application
must
specifically
determine
on
an
evidentiary
basis
in
each
instance
that
there
is
public
need
for
the
gas
that
each
producer
proposes
to
sell.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
that
--
that
issue
was
not
presented
in
the
--
in
the
tenth
circuit
case.
it
has
arisen
in
another
case
in
the
--
the
continental
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit,
where
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
commission's
view
that
the
question
of
need
may
should
appropriately
be
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings
rather
than
in
the
individual
producer
proceeding.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
seemed
to
hold
that
as
a
theoretical
matter,
this
question
of
need
should
be
disposed
within
the
producer
cases,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
recognized
that
really,
you
couldn't
do
it
in
the
producer
cases
and
they
said
that
we
are
not
requiring
an
extensive
hearing
in
each
producer
case,
but
that's
the
--
the
commission
should
make
in
its
view,
references
to
other
cases
to
informal
staff
studies,
to
policy
statements
whenever
it
decides
producer
cases.
and
i
may
say
that
while
--
we
did
not
seek
certiorari
on
the
question.
we
think
that
the
court
was
wrong,
but
we
also
thought
that
administratively,
it
might
be
possible
for
the
commission
to
comply
with
what
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
indicated.
although,
i
will
be
very
frank
in
saying
that
we're
not
sure
what
useful
public
interest
would
be
served
by
doing
what
the
d.c.
circuit
has
said
instead
of
the
commission's
present
procedures.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
read
from
the
court's
decision
which
is
in
volume
4
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
starting
at
page
265
from
the
pagination
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
this
is
the
pagination
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
justice
black.
the
court
says
that,
“although
we
remand
this
case
so
that
the
fpc
can
consider
the
issue
of
public
need,
we
recognize
an
obvious
tension
between
the
statutory
requirement
that
it
do
so
and
administrative
feasibility.
the
public
convenience
in
necessity
includes
many
considerations,
but
there
--
if
there
is
to
be
any
effective
certification
of
the
producers,
the
fpc
must
sometimes
stop
short
of
the
ideal.
it
is
evident
too
that
the
fpc
must
have
great
latitude
in
its
choice
of
procedures.”
we
are
not
demanding
the
fpc
hold
a
long
complex
hearing
in
each
case
--
in
each
of
its
many
producer
application
cases.
but
it
does
not
seem
too
difficult
to
have
the
producer's
customers
or
the
pipeline's
customers
testified
by
the
take-or-pay
situation
regarding
the
broader
aspects
of
the
nature
of
the
gas
business
or
of
conservation,
the
fpc
may
consider
studies
of
its
staff,
may
after
study
issue
policy
statements.
and
it
goes
on
a
little
later
and
says,
“then
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
relitigate
need
in
each
issue.
the
fpc
need
only
show
that
the
broad
statement
or
study
covers
the
particular
certification
before
it”.
in
short,
we
do
not
now
prescribe
any
particular
method
for
deciding
need,
nor,
as
our
discussion
of
what
public
need
means
exhaustive.
and
it
indicates
that
these
decisions
should
be
made
before
the
gas
starts
coming
into
the
market.
and
this
seems
to
be
--
this
is
an
undesirable
objective
but
the
suggestions
of
the
“seaboard
interests”
and
i
think
in
this
instance,
particularly
the
new
york
commission
that
this
can
be
met
by
looking
at
the
need
question
with
respect
to
producer
applications,
where
most
of
the
sales
of
previously
commenced
under
temporary
authorizations
is
totally
unrealistic.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
--
yes
justice
harlan
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
commission
did
not
seek
cert
even
though
there
seems
to
be
a
ostensible
conflict
between
that
decision
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
said
that
if
the
commission
consider
its
need,
then
in
the
producer
cases,
considers
at
the
way
the
new
york
commission
was
urging,
that
it
be
considered,
it
would
have
to
be
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
commission.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
effect
said
put
in
the
paragraph
in
your
order.
we
thought
that
we
--
we
couldn't
live
with
that.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
it
is
very
useful.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
get
to.
the
--
when
gas
is
sold
by
producers,
it
of
course
has
to
be
picked
up
by
pipelines
though
jurisdictional
facilities.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
plain
at
the
outset
because
it
may
have
been
somewhat
misleading
in
our
brief
not
every
producers
sale
has
a
corresponding
pipeline
certificate
proceeding.
in
this
case,
we
have
examined
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
files
and
i'd
say
that
it
--
in
about
75%
of
the
gas,
there
were
actually
some
new
pipeline
facilities
that
were
needed
to
pick
up
the
gas
involved.
now,
the
commission
approved
gas
purchasing
facilities
in
one
of
several
ways.
there
have
--
there
are
many
pipeline
expansion
cases
and
frequently
of
course,
these
include
request
to
build
into
a
particular
field
and
to
purchase
particular
supplies
of
gas.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
many
--
most
of
these
pipelines
have
come
into
the
commission
and
request
what
is
known
as
the
budget
type
certificate.
now,
under
the
budget
type
certificate,
the
company
is
authorized
to
attach
new
supplies
of
gas
in
the
following
year
provided
that
the
facilities
themselves
are
reasonably
inexpensive.
the
--
now
the
--
however,
the
commission's
consideration
of
need
is
not
restricted
to
these
because
the
commission
requires
detailed
information
to
be
filed
by
the
pipeline
companies
with
respect
to
what
their
--
what
gas
is
being
sold
throughout
the
country.
the
deliverability
under
these
supplies
and
then
--
it's
very
detailed
information
which
shows
where
the
gas
is
coming
from.
the
commission
has
required
this
since
1964
and
the
staff
of
the
commission
examines
these
reports
and
is
then
in
the
position
to
determine
at
least
in
its
view
whether
the
company
supply
is
adequate
or
inadequate
and
it
has
advised,
called
in
the
pipelines
to
try
to
explain
why
isn't
there
enough
gas
here.
in
other
situations,
we
have
called
the
pipelines
in
to
explain,
why
are
you
paying
for
gas
which
you
are
not
taking.
these
are
the
prepayments
that
the
new
york
commission
refers
to.
so
that
there
is
a
continuing
surveillance
by
the
commission,
all
this
question
of
need,
both
inadequacy
and
perhaps
the
oversupply
although
in
the
past,
to
a
large
extent,
the
problems
are
related
to
insufficient
supplies.
however,
in
1964,
the
commission
did
recognize
--
the
commission
up
to
1964
had
a
policy
that
you
had
to
have
enough
deliverability,
enough
gas
to
assure
that
you
could
serve
your
markets
for
12
years.
this
meant
that
the
pipelines
would
have
to
go
out
and
buy
enough
gas
to
meet
this
requirement
even
though
they
may
--
might
be
taking
some
gas
that
they
might
not
need
at
that
particular
time.
the
commission
at
the
same
time
that
it
imposed
the
reporting
requirement,
detailed
reporting
requirement
with
respect
to
gas
supplies,
announced
that
it
was
relaxing
this
firm
12-year
deliverability
requirement
and
more
recently,
this
year,
it
has
indicated
that
as
a
result
of
this
realization,
it
appears
that
the
prepayment
problem
has
diminished
to
some
extent
because
this
gives
the
pipelines
greater
flexibility.
but
in
essence
then,
the
commission
reviews
the
supply
problem
on
this
informal
basis
and
also
in
the
formal
cases
and
of
course,
in
many
of
these
pipeline
expansion
cases,
it
looks
at
what
is
needed
by
the
ultimate
market.
it
looks
at
questions
of
conservation,
of
end-use,
increasing
in
the
question
of
whether
gas
should
be
used
to
--
for
oil
or
fuel
by
electric
generation,
generating
plants,
it's
an
issue
which
the
commission
has
to
face
up
to.
and
in
these
formal
proceedings,
it
is
our
view
that
there
is
ample
opportunity
for
any
of
the
parties
who
feel
that
the
gas
supplies
either
inadequate
of
more
than
adequate.
there's
ample
opportunity
for
them
to
participate
and
request
that
the
commission
put
the
consideration
into
a
formal
record
and
that
all
the
parties
put
the
matters
into
a
formal
record.
it
is
also
perfectly
plain
that
even
if
the
question
of
need
were
to
be
considered
in
a
producer
application,
that
the
evidence
relating
to
what
the
--
for
the
need
for
this
gas
would
have
to
come
from
the
pipelines
who
would
know
what
their
need
is
and
perhaps
from
the
pipelines
customers,
because
plainly,
this
is
not
information
which
--
to
which
the
producers
themselves
are
previewed.
and
this
seems
to
be
conceded
but,
it
says
while
this
isn't
too
difficult,
you
can
then
--
they
can
call
the
pipeline
witnesses.
we
suggest
that
the
procedure
which
the
distributors
urge
which
is
much
broader,
i
may
say,
than
the
procedure
which
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
seemed
to
envision,
would
enable
any
purchasing
customer,
any
other
interested
party
who
would
be
entitled
to
intervene
in
the
commission
proceeding
to
in
effect
force
the
commission
to
convert
any
given
producer
case
into
what
would
amount
to
a
national
gas
survey.
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
one
can
really
draw
the
line
once
the
floodgate
is
opened.and
of
course,
if
this
were
--
if
this
had
happened
in
these
cases,
the
commission
had
accepted
that
proposition
in
these
cases,
it
could
not
have
decided
the
in-line
question
in
any
expeditious
fashion.
we
suggest
that
the
argument
that
need
be
considered
here
at
the
request
of
the
consumer
interest
is
really
no
different
from
the
request
which
was
turned
down
in
the
callery
cases
that
the
producers
are
entitled
to
demonstrate
the
supply
and
demand
situation
by
extensive
evidence.
these
are
the
opposite
sides
of
the
coin
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
completely
correct
in
saying
that
the
decision
in
callery
approving
the
commission's
administrative
judgment
as
to
in-line
cases
should
also
be
followed
here.
perhaps
one
word
should
be
said
about
what
these
prepayments
are.
there's
been
a
--
before
the
commission,
the
only
specific
question
of
with
respect
to
need
that
was
raised
by
the
consumer
interest
was
the
allegation
that
some
of
the
pipelines
involved
had
large
prepayment
balances.
producers
sell
to
pipelines
under
long
term
contracts
and
they
are
normally
obligations
under
which
the
pipelines
must
take
a
certain
amount
of
gas
which
is
usually
related
to
the
reserves
underlying
the
contract
or
else
pay
for
it.
however,
this
doesn't
mean
that
if
--
if
you
pay
for
some
gas
not
taken,
that
there's
an
immediate
forfeitures.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
has
had
virtually
no
situations
of
any
forfeiture.
and
there
is
a
period
in
which
the
pipelines
can
make
up
the
gas
previously
paid
for
and
not
taken.
during
this
period
of
make
up,
the
amount
of
money
that
has
been
paid
out
is
included
in
the
pipelines
rate
face,
essentially
its
working
capital
so
that
there
is
then
--
a
return
would
be
earned
on
that
and
this
could
have
some
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
rate
case.
however,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
and
it
is
really
quite
in
the
nature
of
the
gas
producing
business
that
at
times,
a
pipeline
will
have
to
buy
gas
a
little
bit
before
it
needs
all
of
that
to
assure
that
it
has
the
adequate
deliverability
when
its
existing
reserves
start
declining.
in
addition
to
that,
most
pipelines
have
had
rapid
expansion
and
they
have
to
go
out
and
buy
gas
to
make
sure
that
they
will
be
able
to
meet
their
commitments
in
the
future,
because
gas
unlike
staple
products,
has
to
be
bought
when
it
can
be
found
and
at
particular
location.
and
of
course,
some
gas
supplies
are
much
better
than
other
gas
supplies
because
they
are
near
existing
pipelines
and
can
be
utilized
more
efficiently.
so
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
commission
said
that
there
are
sometimes
some
slight
prepayment
situations.
in
some
instances,
although
in
only
one
instance
here,
a
pipeline
has
a
substantial
prepayment
situation
and
that's
united
gas
pipeline
company.
and
most
of
the
gas
which
was
being
sold
that
it
involved
in
these
cases,
is
no
longer
being
sold.
and
then
an
authorization
was
approved
for
that,
so
very
little
gas
to
that
pipeline
company
is
now
at
issue
here.
but
however
that
may
be,
an
in
depth
study
of
the
question
of
whether
a
pipeline
needs
the
gas
to
meet
its
actual
delivery
requirements,
a
question
which
is
not
directly
related
to
whether
or
not
its
--
in
the
past
for
example,
it
has
had
to
pay
for
some
gas
it
couldn't
use.
in
itself
would
present
a
complex
problem
which
would
greatly
complicate
--
would
have
complicated
these
in-line
proceedings.
and
we
think
that
the
commission's
view
that
questions
this
type
are
appropriately
to
be
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings
both
to
the
informal
methods
i've
described
and
through
formal
hearing
procedures
is
plainly
reasonable
in
the
proper
exercise
of
the
commission's
regulatory
functions.
for
these
reasons,
we
asked
that
all
the
commission
orders
here
under
review
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice.
briefly,
i
think
i
should
make
it
clear
on
the
--
with
respect
to
refunds,
that
first,
we
do
believe
that
the
--
without
prejudice
language
in
the
temporaries,
certainly
shows
the
non-finality
of
the
rates
which
were
permitted
to
be
charged
under
the
temporary
authorization.
at
the
same
time,
if
i
did
not
make
this
clear
yesterday,
the
commission
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
with
respect
to
in-liners
has
changed
its
view
as
to
the
equity
of
ordering
refunds
where
there
has
been
no
express
conditions
stating
that
refunds
would
not
be
required
at
the
end.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
think,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
--
it's
certainly
our
action
is
contrary
to
our
or
the
commission's
view
on
the
equities
in
that
order.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities
in
the
february
5th
order
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities
in
the
skelly
case
which
was
decided
by
the
commission
in
august
of
1962.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
opinion
is
as
i
read
it
and
it's
consistently
with
your
earlier
decision
is
not
that
the
commissions
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
of
these
even
without
the
expressed
refund
condition.
it
is
a
view
that
the
commission
at
that
time
did
not
think
it
would
be
equitable
to
order
refunds.
subsequently,
had
the
consequence
no
doubt,
of
the
reversal
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
skelly
case
and
upon
a
more
considered
in
depth
consideration
of
the
equities,
the
commission
concluded
that
although
it
assumed
that
the
producers
reasonably
relied
on
the
lack
of
refund
condition
in
the
belief
that
they
would
not
have
to
order
refunds,
the
commission
then
concluded
that
it
would
be
equitable
to
order
refunds.
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
a
change
in
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities.
and
then
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
and
--
and
if
--
i
don't
think
that
order
really
makes
any
difference
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
let
me
get
to
it.
the
temporaries
in
this
case
were
issued
in
service
commenced
long
before
this
february
5th
order
was
entered.
the
commission's
action
in
--
the
distributors
in
the
motion
which
led
up
to
this
order,
requested
the
commission
alternatively
to
either
vacate
the
temporaries
that
had
been
issued
or
else
to
impose
a
prospective
refund
condition.
in
that
motion,
the
distributors
pointed
out
that
they
were
challenging
in
court
the
power
of
the
commission
or
the
propriety
of
the
commission
not
ordering
refunds
and
not
imposing
refund
conditions.
the
commission
in
its
february
5th
order
said
that
because
service
had
already
commenced,
it
did
not
regard
it
as
appropriate
to
vacate
these
temporaries
because
before
you
could
stop
service
with
respect
to
flowing
gas,
the
commission
should
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
abandonment
was
justified.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
fair
play
if
we
now
after
service
had
commenced
change
the
terms
of
service.
i
don't
believe,
i'm
not
sure,
but
in
my
view,
that
order
was
in
the
context
of
a
contention
that
the
commission
has
a
power
to
order
refunds
in
any
event
and
all
the
commission
was
doing
here
is
saying
we
still
think
that
it
isn't
equitable
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
think
it
--
i
think
the
commission
would
have
been
wrong
in
construing
that
it
did
not
have
the
power.
i
don't
think
that
that
order
was
strictly
reviewable
at
that
time
because
the
service
was
already
flowing
and
it
really
related
to
the
consequences
it
would
have
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
i
don't
think
that
the
february
5th
order
changed
the
consequences
or
the
situation
that
existed
prior
to
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
it
was
a
wrong
construction
that
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
construction
--
i
think
that
construction,
if
that
was
a
construction
that
we
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
would
be
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
under
those
conditions,
would
be
an
interlocutory
interpretation
by
the
commission
which
was
not
binding
even
upon
the
commission
and
was
not
viewed
as
the
commission's
interpretation
in
the
later
order.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
very
definitely,
i
think
the
commission
has
the
power
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
even
under
the
conditions
that
it
had
not
imposed
an
expressed
refund
condition
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
yesterday,
i
think
in
effect
that
because
of
the
prior
history
of
refund
conditions
and
no
refund
conditions,
that
you
virtually
have
to
get
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
order
refunds
where
there
is
a
tentative
rate
even
if
it
had
said
we
do
not
intend
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
this
february
5th
order
was
after
these
certificates
were
issued
or
it's
long
after
the
time
when
they
had
commenced
service
under
those
certificates.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
the
--
oh,
the
commission
takes
a
view
and
i
take
the
view
that
the
certificate
holders
--
because
not
just
because
of
this
order,
but
also
because
other
commission
orders
in
this
period
had
the
right
to
believe
that
they
would
not
be
required
to
make
refunds
and
the
commission
in
the
order
in
its
opinion
501
where
it
did
order
refunds
expressly
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
had
been
reasonable
reliance.
but
it
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
producers
when
given
an
opportunity
to
show
any
detriment
from
that
reliance
had
failed
to
do
so
except
with
a
very
limited
area
of
royalties
which
was
specifically
paid
out
on
reliance
on
the
higher
price
and
certain
state
production
taxes.
and
it
is
our
view
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
differentiated
from
callery
which
i
think
it's
illegal
for
callery,
we
think
on
a
legal
proposition
is
certainly
controlling.
but
in
terms
of
equity,
the
commission's
course
of
conduct
here
may
have
been
such
as
to
induce
the
producers
to
pay
out
certain
specific
sums
which
it
would
not
otherwise
have
paid
out.
and
we
based
on
our
decision
on
that
assumption.
but
beyond
that,
we
think
that
has
to
be
reliance
and
a
detriment
from
that
reliance.
and
the
producers
simply
haven't
shown
any
detriment
except
in
the
very
limited
circumstances
i've
made.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh!
yes.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
opinion
501
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
it's
ordered
a
refund,
opinion
501
which
is
in
this
small
section
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
this
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
there
had
been
a
series
of
other
cases
where
the
commission
has
ordered
refunds
in
comparable
circumstances.
there
is
the
case
which
is
pending
here
from
the
tenth
circuit,
pan
american
case
which
relates
to
a
commission
proceeding
involving
many
south
louisiana
sales.
i
believe
that
in
that
case,
there
was
an
order
similar
to
the
february
5th
order.
the
commission
has
ordered
re
--
well,
it
hasn't
ordered
refunds
there
yet.
but
it
has
again,
said
that
this
called
for
hearings
to
determine
the
equities.
but
it
has
now
ordered
refunds
in
the
hawkins
case
which
is
the
texas
district
3
case.
that
case
is
pending
in
the
tenth
circuit.
it
has
ordered
refunds
in
the
case
relating
to
sun
oil.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
one
--
in
one
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
referred
to
yesterday,
i
think
it's
hawkins.
there
was
a
situation
where
a
producer
showed
and
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief,
produced
to
show
that
these
very
large
--
that
he
had
very
large
refunds
in
relation
to
his
own
operations.
and
that
this,
if
he
was
required
to
make
refunds
immediately,
might
cause
them
difficulties
even
though
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
could
be
spread
out
over
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
in
this
respect,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
that
early
skelly
case,
agreed
with
us
that
we
should
consider
the
equity.
and
the
equities
there
were
--
that
were
presented
to
them,
there
was
in
fact
that
there
had
been
no
specific
refund
obligation
and
the
judge
fahy
in
writing
that
opinion,
recognized
as
the
commission
has
here
that
the
commission
had
not
followed
the
straightest
line
in
these
matters
and
that
we
had
to
take
this
into
account.
i
may
say
that
there
was
an
argument,
i
think
both
by
the
counsels
here
and
there's
an
amicus
brief
which
suggest
that
the
commission
has
a
declared
law
which
may
producers
were
entitled
to
rely
upon.
whatever
that
means
here,
the
commission
accepted
the
reliance
but
it
didn't
find
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
that
is
the
situa
--
well
that
is
the
situation
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
maybe
i
have
--
i
better
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
if
the
commission
had
fixed
a
16-cent
which
is
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
and
you
now
were
--
remanded
and
(voice
overlap)
ultimately
would
be
15.
i
think
that
would
still
be
callery.
i
think
it
would
just
change
the
measure
of
refunds
but
it
wouldn't
change
the
legal
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh!
we
approved
the
original
rate
in
the
--
in
the
original
certificate
just
as
much
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
had
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
proper
certificate
price
when
we
issued
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
callery,
that
those
were
the
cases
that
were
set
aside
in
the
ugi
case
but
we
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
agreed
upon
in
this
--
well,
that
--
that
was
a
rate
that
the
contract
rates
and
we
simply
didn't
lower
it
in
that
sense.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
don't
think
in
terms
of
say
the
arizona
grocery
case
of
reparations
that
these
are
--
these
were
any
different.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
without
specifically
approving
rates?
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case
indicates
that
the
commission
must
give
careful
scrutiny
to
the
rates
of
the
commission
if
it
wants
to
give
scrutiny
to
the
rates
in
the
certificate
case
then
of
course
has
discretion
in
large
measure
to
determine
whether
it
will
have
a
rate
hearing.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
it
approved
them
in
the
sense
that
these
were
the
rates
that
could
legally
be
charged,
that
if
by
the
producer
by
charging
them
could
not
have
been
held
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
didn't
approve
the
level
of
the
rates.
it
didn't
find
that
they're
either
the
just
reasonable
rate
or
the
appropriate
certificate
rate.
it
was
allowing
the
rates
to
be
charged.
i
think
the
commission
has
a
power
to
do
that.
it
doesn't
have
to
necessarily
give
either
the
scrutiny
required
by
section
or
by
rate
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
all
these
rates
are
involved
in
the
area
rate
proceeding
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast.
and
we
have
considered
them
in
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
why
we
think
that
we
do
could
order
refunds
here
down
to
the
price
determined
in
the
permanent
certificate
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
make
a
full
adjudication
of
the
rates
before
we
permit
them
to
commence
service
under
a
temporary.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
so
on
the
questions
of
need.
and
i
like
to
reiterate
that
the
commission
fully
realized
this
that
it
must
consider
not
only
whether
the
pipelines
are
getting
sufficient
quantities
of
gas
but
also
whether
there
are
more
than
sufficient
quantities
of
gas
being
purchased
and
what
effect
this
might
have
on
the
rates
of
the
pipelines
and
consequently
on
the
rates
of
the
producers
--
or
of
the
consumers.
the
–-
well,
i
see
my
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
but
basically
our
view,
however,
as
i
said
before
is
that
the
question
of
need
may
and
can,
and
is
being
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings.
the
particular
pipeline
facilities
involved
in
these
cases
have
been
approved
in
the
past.
but
normally,
in
order
to
consider
the
question
of
need
before
the
gas
goes
into
the
market
which
is
the
proper
time
to
consider
it
is
in
pipeline
proceedings.
it
cannot
be
done
in
producer
proceedings
unless
you
simply
eliminate
temporaries
because
as
was
recognized
before,
the
gas
will
be
flowing
long
before
for
a
long
time
before
the
question
of
a
need
can
be
finally
determined
in
a
producer
case.
so
in
these
circumstances,
the
appropriate
place
is
in
the
pipeline
proceedings
and
there
are
continuing
pipeline
proceedings.
they
are
always
asking
for
new
facilities
to
pick
up
more
gas,
there
are
these
budget
facilities,
we
believe
that
these
cases
provide
an
ample
opportunity
for
the
consumer
interest.
those
present
here
and
any
others
to
express
their
views
as
to
the
needs
of
the
pipelines
and
of
the
various
markets
affected.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
group
of
cases
before
the
court
today
are
part
of
the
commission's
interim
program
for
determining
initial
certificate
prices
for
the
sales
by
independent
producers
of
natural
gas.
this
is
interim
awaiting
the
commission's
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
area
rate
proceedings.
under
this
interim
program
which
this
court
has
--
had
the
occasion
to
discuss
in
the
second
phillips
case
and
has
dealt
with
to
some
extent
in
the
callery
case
in
1965.
the
commission
building
on
another
decision
of
this
court
the
catco
case
which
was
decided
in
1959,
that
was
under
the
style
of
atlantic
refining
company
and
public
service
commission
of
new
york
has
been
using
its
conditioning
power
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
stabilize
prices,
producer
prices
or
in
the
words
of
this
court
to
attempt
to
hold
the
line.
as
an
early
part
of
this
interim
program,
the
commission
at
the
time
that
it
decided
the
second
phillips
case
that
is
the
case
where
it
concluded
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
of
independent
producers
should
be
determined
on
a
area
basis.
the
commission
promulgated
a
statement
of
general
policy
designating
23
pricing
areas
and
for
each
of
these
pricing
areas,
it
established
a
ceiling
price
above
which
the
commission
would
not
permit
gas
to
add
on
the
market
under
the
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
if
there
was
no
objection,
the
commission
would
issue
a
premise
certificate
at
those
prices.
if
there
were
objection,
the
commission
would
issue
temporary
certificates
if
the
proper
allegations
were
made
by
the
producers
and
requested
such
certificates.
these
ceilings
or
guidelines
as
they
have
been
referred
to
were
issued
in
september
of
1960.
and
while
some
of
these
guidelines
has
subsequently
been
adjusted
downward,
the
guidelines
themselves
did
clamp
a
lid
on
the
price
rise
that
have
been
generated
in
the
market.
during
the
same
general
period
of
time,
the
commission
in
attempting
to
apply
the
requirement
to
hold
line
commends
the
series
of
the
so-called
in-line
proceedings
and
the
case
is
there
before
the
court
now
fit
into
that
category.
the
commission
as
part
of
this
interim
program
has
had
more
than
25
proceedings
to
determine
the
appropriate
initial
certificate
price
for
producer
sales
and
these
are
related
to
13
pricing
areas.
as
a
result
of
this
program,
the
price
rise
as
i've
indicated
would
stop
and
the
program
as
mr.
solomon
told
you
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
argument
has
resulted
in
price
reductions
below
the
proposed
contract
levels
of
about
$134
million.
this
included
both
the
fully
adjudicated
cases
as
well
as
settlements
which
generally
followed
the
principles.
it
does
not
include
the
amounts
of
money
that
are
involved
in
these
cases.
the
--
essentially
the
in-line
program
that
i
have
described
should
be
viewed
as
being
in
the
past
tense
because
except
for
the
texas
gulf
coast
area
which
is
involved
here
and
the
south
louisiana
area,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
appropriate
initial
certificate
price
and
the
price
question
at
least
poses
no
barrier
to
the
issuance
of
permanent
certificates.
and
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
areas
and
in
the
south
louisiana
area,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
commission
will
not
conduct
further
in-line
proceedings
of
the
type
that
are
involved
here
but
that
instead
it
will
issue
the
--
as
it
had
issue
temporary
authorization
for
the
guideline
prices
and
then
determine
the
final
certificate
price
on
the
basis
of
the
just
and
reasonable
determination
to
be
made
in
the
pending
area
rate
proceedings.
now,
in
saying
this
i
do
not
wished
to
give
the
impression
that
this
case
is
of
no
consequence
because
indeed
the
resolution
of
the
series
of
conflicting
court
of
appeals'
decisions
will
determine
the
disposition
of
--
in
the
neighborhood
of
$20
to
$30
million.
the
present
group
of
cases
arise
from
three
different
commission
proceedings
relating
to
something
more
than
a
hundred
sales
by
independent
producers.
each
proceeding
related
to
one
of
the
pricing
areas
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
in
the
commission
for
these
purposes
has
followed
the
designations
of
areas
of
the
texas
railroad
commission.
so,
the
commission
had
a
separate
proceeding
for
texas
district
4
which
with
the
first
case
at
--
in
time
and
another
one
for
texas
district
number
2
and
a
third
one
for
texas
district
number
3.
and
the
cases
arise
from
two
different
courts
of
appeals.
the
first
one,
relating
the
so-called
amerada
case
comes
from
the
decisions
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
other
two
cases
which
have
been
generally
referred
to
by
the
courts
and
the
commission
as
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
cases
were
decided
at
the
--
at
one
time
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch,
these
cases
involved
about
hundred
sales
of
independent
producers
from
the
various
pricing
districts
on
--
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
the
sales
involved
were
all
contracted
for
during
the
period
from
about
1958
to
1963.
and
in
just
about
all
instances,
the
sales
commenced
under
a
temporary
authorizations
which
are
issued
on
the
basis
of
producer
allegations
of
emergency
and
without
any
notice
for
hearing.
the
--
for
the
period
prior
to
the
policy
statement
which
was
issued
in
september
1960,
the
temporary
in
some
instances
ranged
up
to
a
price
of
20
cents.
and
for
the
period
after
that,
there
were
no
prices
that
were
charged
although
there
are
some
higher
contracts
but
no
price
is
charged
at
above
the
18-cent
guideline
price
level.
in
the
first
of
the
three
proceedings
that
is
here
which
is
known
as
--
was
known
as
the
amerada
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
with
respect
to
which
--
there
are
two
volumes
of
the
joint
appendix,
numbers
1
and
2,
that
case
involves
sales
in
texas
district
number
4
and
in
all
instances,
the
contracts
involved
were
executed
after
the
date
of
the
policy
statement
in
1960.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
policy
statement
guideline
was
18
cents.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
fixed
the
in-line
prize
at
16
cents
and
it
deferred
for
later
consideration
the
question
of
whether
it
should
order
of
refunds
with
the
respect
to
most
of
the
temporary
authorizations
involved
because
these
temporaries
did
not
have
an
expressed
warning
that
refunds
might
be
issued
in
connection
with
the
permanent
certificate.
the
reason
for
the
deferral
was
that
in
an
earlier
case,
the
commission
had
held
that
in
its
view
it
would
not
be
equitable
to
require
the
producers,
although
they
had
charged
excess
amounts
during
the
temporary
authorization
to
make
refunds,
simply
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
expressed
warning
of
this
possibility.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
in
the
case
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
the
skelly
case
decided
that
the
commission
in
those
circumstances
would
as
the
commission
itself
believed
have
the
power
to
order
refunds
and
that
in
addition,
the
--
in
its
view,
the
commission
had
not
adequately
considered
the
equitable
factors
relating
to
refunds.
this
decision
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
just
about
two
month
before
the
commission's
decision
in
amerada
and
since
the
court
had
told
the
commission
that
it
should
give
more
penetrating
analysis
of
the
equitable
considerations,
the
commission
followed
that
same
course
here.
on
review,
the
tenth
circuit
stating
its
view
that
the
commission
would
have
no
power
to
order
any
refunds
in
these
circumstances
said
that
the
commission
had
erred
in
deferring
the
refund
question.
but
it
did
find
that
the
commission's
determination
of
the
16-cent
in-line
price
was
properly
supported.
in
so
doing,
it
rejected
tax
by
producers
that
this
16-cent
price
was
too
low
and
also
the
contentions
of
the
new
york
commission
and
various
eastern
distributors
whom
we
have
referred
to
as
the
“seaboard
interests”
collectively,
their
contentions
that
the
line
should
have
been
no
more
than
15
cents.
during
the
pendency
of
the
tenth
circuit
proceedings,
the
commission
in
fact
concluded
the
deferred
refund
proceeding
and
held
that,
with
very
limited
exceptions,
the
producers
as
an
equitable
matter
should
make
refunds
of
all
the
amounts
in
excess
of
the
16-cent
in-line
price
that
the
commission
had
determined.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
think
in
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
these
very
cases
and
on
--
i
think
the
order
is
in
early
1963,
the
commission
had
denied
a
request
by
the
some
of
the
interveners
to
impose
a
condition
for
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
--
well
i
--
i
believe
that
even
--
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
white,
in
these
cases
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
commission
in
effect
in
that
order
was
saying
that
we
have
previously
expressed
our
views
in
the
skelly
case
that
it
would
not
be
equitable
to
order
refunds
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
condition,
and
we
don't
think
that
we
should
change
the
nature
or
the
condition
after
the
service
under
the
temporary
had
already
commenced.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
now
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
there's
no
question,
but
that
was
what
the
commission
was
saying.
even
though
there
is
some
language
in
the
--
in
all
of
these
temporary
authorizations
which
said
that
the
grant
of
the
temporary
authorization
with
--
is
without
prejudice
to
the
final
disposition
of
the
rate
questions
and
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
--
well,
that
it
would
have
the
power
to
say,
“we
will
not
order
refunds”
i
think
the
thrust
of
these
--
the
opinions
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
of
the
d.c.
and
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
at
least
in
the
present
circumstances,
in
the
way
these
temporaries
are
issued
without
any
notice
are
--
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
producers
who
are
claiming
that
they
--
they
have
to
flare
their
gas
that
their
gas
maybe
drained,
these
are
their
own
representations
of
emergency.
i
think
in
these
circumstances
that
the
--
it
is
implicit
in
our
decision
that
in
these
circumstances,
we
cannot
impose
--
we
can't
relieve
the
producers
of
a
refund
obligation.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
commission
was
--
before
that
had
never
--
has
never
said
it
could
not
order
refunds
even
in
those
circumstances.
well,
let
me
--
if
i
may
describe
the
problem
that
arose
or
the
situation
that
developed.
the
commission
in
some
instances,
in
issuing
these
temporary
authorizations
did
impose
express
refund
conditions
and
in
others
it
did
not
impose
expressed
refund
conditions.
in
1959,
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
sunray
case
set
aside
the
commission
temporary
authorization
where
the
commission
had
imposed
a
refund
obligation.
and
it
said,
it
decided
on
the
ground
that
the
obligation
was
too
indefinite
because
the
commission
said
you
may
have
to
make
refunds
down
to
the
certificate
price
that
we
ultimately
determined.
and
the
tenth
circuit
seemed
to
take
the
view
that
the
commission
would
have
to
put
a
floor
in
on
any
refund
condition
that
it
might
impose.
thereafter,
the
commission
in
most
instances,
at
least
where
the
price
was
at
the
level
that
the
commission
viewed
to
be
the
appropriate
guideline
price
did
not
insert
any
refund
conditions
although
it
did
include
in
their
certificates
the
warning
that
this
price
is
--
or
these
temporaries
are
without
prejudice
to
what
the
commission
might
ultimately
do.
but
there
was
never
any
expressed
statement
by
the
commission
at
any
time
that
it
could
not
order
refunds
in
these
circumstances.
and
indeed
when
this
issue
was
first
decided,
i
think
in
the
skelly
case,
the
commission
said,
“we
don't
think
it
would
be
equitable
because
we
hadn't
given
you
notice”,
and
of
course
there
was
this
course
of
conduct
only
commission
which
--
the
commission
in
these
cases
has
acknowledges,
lead
the
producers
to
think
that
they
might
not
have
to
make
refunds.
but
we
don't
think
that
this
goes
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
order
refunds.
at
most,
we
think,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
equitable
to
require
them
to
make
refunds
and
that
before
the
producers
can
be
--
or
that
the
mere
fact
of
reliance
doesn't
prove
that
there
has
been
--
and
doesn't
even
show
that
there
has
been
any
detrimental
reliance
thereon.
on
the
other
hand,
the
consumers
for
whom
the
act
is
--
for
whose
protection
the
act
was
primarily
adopted
have
had
no
notice
before
these
temporaries
are
even
issued.
now,
in
that
respect,
at
the
time
of
this
february
5th
order,
justice
white,
the
temporaries
had
already
been
issued,
the
service
had
already
commenced.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
asked
that
prospectively
that
there'd
be
a
refund
condition
imposed
and
the
commission
adhering
to
its
view
in
the
skelly
case
that
no,
we
don't
think
we
should
change
it.
but,
this
wouldn't
have
given
the
producers
the
option,
for
example
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
said
in
sunray,
they
should
have
by
being
able
to
reject
the
certificate
if
they
didn't
like
the
terms
and
conditions.
we
would
merely
have
been
putting
in
something
supplemental
and
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
that
the
commission's
grant
or
denial
of
the
motion
would
have
very
much
legal
significance.
if
the
commission
had
granted
the
--
had
modified
it,
of
course
i
think
it
would
have
cutoff
any
equitable
argument
that
the
producer
should
thereafter
not
have
to
make
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
that
is
certainly
true.
that
in
light
of
the
--
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
that
is
very,
very
much
so.
but
then,
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
story
of
all
of
everything
in
these
in-line
proceedings
that's
been
a
constant
course
of
commission
decisions
and
approval
by
the
court
in
some
instance,
disapproval
and
as
these
cases
as
well
as
two
other
cases
which
are
pending
on
certiorari
petitions
that
this
point
show
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
totally
at
odds
with
each
other
and
in
some
instance
with
the
commission
and
obviously
in
others
is
not.
the
--
i
think
as
long
as
i
have
been
discussing
the
refund
issue
to
this
extent,
i
will
proceed
with
that
and
connote
that
in
the
other
two
cases
involved
here,
involving
the
other
two
districts
and
the
one
which
came
up
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
refund
question
except
to
say
that
the
deferral
of
the
refund
question
there
was
appropriate.
and
i
will
get
back
to
those
in
discussing
the
issues
on
the
merits.
in
our
view,
the
--
we
believe
that
the
commission's
power
to
order
refunds
in
this
case
is
very
much
the
same
issue
that
this
court
decided
in
1965
in
the
callery
case.
in
the
callery
case,
the
commission
had
originally
issued
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
at
the
level
of
about
22
cents
and
above.
this
was
the
level
which
had
been
disapproved
in
the
earlier
catco
case.
the
commission's
decisions
in
these
cases
were
set
aside
both
by
summary
reversal
in
one
instance
by
this
court
and
by
a
series
a
court
of
appeals
decisions
holding
that
the
commission
hadn't
adequately
considered
the
price
question.
on
remand
from
those
cases,
the
commission
found
that
the
appropriate
in-line
price
was
20
cents.
however,
in
the
meantime,
the
producers
had
been
selling
their
gas
under
these
permanent
certificates
they
had
started
after
the
hearing
and
after
the
certificate
order.
but
with
knowledge
that
there
was
going
to
be
court
review
or
that
it
had
not
in
fact
been
instituted.
there
was
no
condition
inserted
or
given
by
either
the
commission
or
the
courts
prior
to
the
time
that
they
commend
service.
the
commission
ordered
the
refunds
down
to
the
price
ultimately
found
to
be
the
appropriate
in-line
price.
it
was
argued
in
that
case
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
because
we
lack
reparations
authority.
the
court
held,
however,
in
agreeing
with
the
commission
that
the
lack
or
reparations
authority
does
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
the
order
under
which
rates
are
collected
is
in
itself
not
a
final
order.
now,
in
callery,
it
is
true
that
the
order
was
subject
to
court
review.
in
this
instance,
we
do
not
believe
that
these
temporary
authorizations
which
are
issued
on
ex
parte
basis
on
the
basis
of
producer
representations
of
emergency
without
any
notice
or
hearing
and
without
any
realistic
opportunity
to
obtain
court
review
that
the
temporaries
have
any
greater
claim
to
finality
than
did
the
certificates
under
which
service
was
rendered
in
the
cases
involved
in
the
callery
case.
if
anything,
there's
even
less
claim
to
finality
here.
the
argument
which
seems
to
the
contrary
that
is
pressed
is
of
temporary
authorizations
can
be
reviewed.
and
of
course,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
temporaries
have
been
reviewed
and
generally,
at
the
instance
of
the
producers
themselves
whether
not
been
satisfied
with
the
condition
--
price
reduction
conditions
or
other
conditions
that
the
commission
has
imposed.
there
has
been
one
instance
where
the
new
york
commission
obtained
review
of
temporary
authorizations.
its
challenge
was
principally
that
we
had
no
power
to
issue
temporary
authorizations
at
all.
the
new
york
commend
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
sustained
the
commission's
power
to
issue
temporary
authorizations,
it
indicated
that
it
if
temporaries
were
going
to
achieve
the
objective
that
they
were
intended
to,
of
permitting
a
producer
to
start
service
quickly
because
of
these
emergencies
that
do
exist
in
the
field
and
basically
they're
economic
emergencies,
that
there
could
be
no
comprehensive
review
of
a
temporary
authorization.
and
of
course,
there
is
no
actual
notice
or
any
formal
notice
to
the
--
any
of
the
distributors.
if
they
are
careful
and
keep
tabs
of
what's
going
on
in
the
public
information
office
at
the
commission,
there
is
narrow
file,
i
don't
know
when
they
started
which
shows
the
temporaries
that
are
issued,
but
there
is
no
notice
to
them.
there
is
no
opportunity
to
object.
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
review,
the
whole
purpose
of
temporaries
could
not
be
achieved.
to
give
finality
to
the
temporaries,
we
suggest,
would
convert
them
into
a
limited
term
permanent
certificates
without
any
real
scrutiny
of
the
--
of
them
in
light
of
the
public
interest
and
we
believe
that
the
callery
decision
as
to
the
power
of
the
commission
is
fully
controlling.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
it's
possible.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
in-line
price
being
the
price
which
has
been
permanently
certificated,
my
answer
is
no.
that
would
then
be
a
firm
price
which
the
commission
would
not
--
it
couldn't
go
back
for
the
at
least
the
period
prior
to
the
initiation
of
a
--
of
an
increased
rate
proceeding.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
commission's
rate
powers
are
under
section
5,
there
are
two
determinant
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
be
charged
thereafter.
under
section
4,
the
commission
has
a
power
to
order
refunds
from
the
time
that
a
rate
become
--
goes
into
effect
subject
to
--
to
refund.
the
--
to
order
refunds
for
the
period
prior
that
time
would
under
the
cases
where
there
has
been
a
final
commission
decision
be
regarded
as
reparations
which
this
court
in
cases
relating
both
to
the
federal
power
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
has
indicated
that
the
commission
has
no
reparations
authority
which
is
derived
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
well.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
let's
had
--
the
company
would
have
had
temporary
authorization
and
then
we
would
fix
the
in-line
price
which
would
be
the
permanent
certificate
price.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
do
under
the
orders
which
the
commission
has
issued
and
which
are
under
review.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
the
power
that
we
--
to
refund
that
we
exercised
in
this
case
was
at
the
time
that
we
issued
the
permanent
certificates
in
these
cases,
we
said
that
you
should
make
refunds
for
the
period
of
time
during
which
you
are
collecting
and
selling
under
your
temporary
authorization.
we
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
once
a
permanent
certificate
is
at
least
finally
approved
by
the
courts,
the
power
to
issue
--
to
go
behind
that
rate
ceases.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
unless
we
reserve
some
power
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
except
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
the
permanent
cert
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
i'm
sure
that
we
can,
in
the
permanent
certificate
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
on
the
permanent
certificate
--
well
there
have
been
some
--
and
not
in
the
producer
cases.
we
have
imposed
some
price
conditions
even
on
permanent
certificates
especially
pipelines
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
but
this
is
subject
to
future
revision.
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
the
specific
kind
of
condition
that
you
mentioned,
no.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
i'm
--
as
i
indicated
that
the
--
we
think
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
plainly
incorrect
in
finding
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
on
grounds
of
finality.
the
tenth
circuit
although
it
alleged
not
to
pass
on
the
equities
of
the
situation,
also
held
in
saying
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
order
refund.
it
said
that
in
its
view
for
the
good
of
the
public,
the
consumers,
the
distributors,
the
pipelines
and
the
producers,
certainty
and
stability
are
prime
importance.
and
it
also
stated
in
its
opinion
that
the
repricing
of
gas
without
warning
cannot
help
but
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
operations
of
the
producer.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
factors
to
the
extent,
they
are
relevant
as
to
whether
refunds
should
be
required
or
not,
relate
not
to
the
commission's
power
but
to
the
--
the
equities
of
the
circumstances.
and
that
this
is
a
question
which
the
commission
should
be
allowed
to
pass
on
in
the
first
instance
and
which
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
did
pass
on
in
the
separate
proceeding.
and
at
that
time,
the
producers
in
the
commission's
view
made
no
showing
of
being
harmed
by
not
having
had
notice
of
the
refund
condition.
the
commission
assumed
that
they
could
properly
--
had
properly
relied
on
the
commission's
own
course
of
conduct
in
the
thinking
that
they
would
not
make
refunds.
but
the
commission
found
that
there
were
only
two
situations
where
the
producers
had
shown
harm.
one
was
that
the
producers
had
paid
out
royalties
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
the
in-line
price
and
the
higher
price
being
collected.
and
it
appeared
that
even
if
these
royalties
--
this
amount
could
be
recouped
from
the
royalty
owners,
that
the
practicalities
of
such
recoupment
would
be
prohibitive.
it
also
appeared
that
in
some
instances
it
might
not
be
possible
to
recover
state
production
taxes
paid
to
the
state
of
texas
although
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
setoff
where
they
were
continuing
sales
to
the
extent
that
such
setoff
was
not
possible,
the
commission
held
that
producers
should
be
relieved
of
any
obligation
to
make
refunds
as
to
those
amounts.
in
fact,
these
amounts
are
less
than
the
--
or
probably
about
an
eighth
of
the
total
amount
that
of
the
excess
collections.
other
than
that,
there
were
various
allegations
by
the
producers
that
the
--
their
financial
stability
would
be
affected
and
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
order
refunds
because
of
the
adverse
effects
on
budgeting
and
planning.
and
in
the
commission's
view,
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
in
reliance
on
the
transitory
nature
of
these
temporaries,
that
any
real
long-range
commitments
could
be
made
with
respect
to
--
on
that
basis.
it
also
did
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
refund
themselves,
would
have
any
significant
impact
on
the
operation
of
producers.
however,
it
did
recognized
expressly
in
another
case
which
came
out
about
the
same
time
is
these,
that
if
a
producer
could
demonstrate
that
by
making
a
large
refund,
the
smaller
producer
would
have
to
make
a
large
refund
and
that
this
would
cause
him
serious
present
difficulties,
that
the
commission
would
permit
this
to
be
refunded
over
a
period
of
time,
that
it
had
no
intention
or
desire
to
use
the
refunding
process
to
put
any
company
into
bankruptcy
or
other
dire
restraints.
but
unless
this
was
shown
which
hasn't
been
shown
at
any
of
the
cases
at
the
dockets
before
this
court,
the
commission
felt
that
this
did
not
provide
a
reason
for
excusing
the
refunds
or
the
excess
amounts
collected
when
if
judged
in
the
context
that
the
consumers
during
this
period
of
time
have
been
paying
excess
amounts
of
money.
the
--
i
do
wished
to
urge,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
pass
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
assessment
of
the
equities
because
in
its
view,
the
commission
simply
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
and
the
assessment
of
the
equities
came
up
in
a
second
proceeding.
we
have
urged
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
that
the
court
decide
this
issue
now
even
though
the
tenth
circuit
has
not
passed
on
it.
i
suggest
that
this
is
especially
appropriate
because
this
question
of
power
as
viewed
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
question
of
the
equities
seems
to
be
closely
interrelated.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
our
estimate
is
that
for
the
period
prior
to
the
commission's
order
or
orders,
not
just
here
but
also
in
--
on
the
cases
relating
the
south
louisiana
and
another
case
involving
the
texas
gulf
coast,
both
of
which
are
the
cases
are
pending
on
certiorari
petitions,
that
under
the
commission's
order,
the
refund
obligations
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$10
million,
this
would
be
increased
perhaps
by
an
equivalent
amount
but
i
think
by
somewhat
less
depending
on
the
disposition
of
the
price
question.
and
i'd
like
--
i'd
now
liked
to
turn
to
the
price
level
question.
i've
indicated
that
the
tenth
circuit
sustained
the
commission's
determination
of
16-cent
in-line
price.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
dealing
with
the
proceedings
coming
up
from
the
two
other
texas
gulf
coast
areas
thought
that
the
commission's
--
in
both
of
those
areas,
the
commission
had
sales
relating
both
to
the
period
before
the
policy
statement
and
for
the
period
after
the
policy
statement.
for
the
pre-policy
statement
period
in
texas
district
2,
it
found
an
in-line
price
of
15
cents
which
is
not
the
issue
here
are
at
all.
and
for
the
periods
subsequent
to
the
policy
statement
for
that
area,
it's
on
the
16-cent
in-line
price.
this
is
challenged
by
the
“seaboard
interests”
and
the
commission's
decision
in
this
respect
that
were
set
aside
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
similarly,
in
the
texas
district
3
which
is
the
part
of
the
gulf
coast
which
is
adjacent
to
south
louisiana,
the
commission
found
a
16-cent
pre-policy
statement
in-line
price
which
i
may
say
was
in
reaffirmance
of
earlier
decisions
on
this
point.
that
price
is
challenged
by
the
superior
oil
companies
being
too
low.
and
for
the
post-policy
statement
period,
the
commission
found
an
in-line
price
of
17
cents
which
is
challenged
by
the
“seaboard
interest”
as
being
too
high
and
by
the
superior
oil
company
as
being
too
low.
the
question
of
price
is
as
the
commission
has
recognized,
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
1959
in
the
callery
--
in
the
catco
case,
a
question
of
the
major
importance
in
our
producer
certificate
cases.
in
line
with
that
--
this
court's
decision,
however,
it's
been
recognized
that
the
determination
of
the
proper
price
at
which
sales
can
commence
should
be
done
in
a
expeditious
type
of
proceeding
and
not
in
a
just
and
reasonable
--
not
as
in
a
case
involving
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
--
the
objective
is
to
--
if
the
price
is
too
high
is
to
reduce
it
quickly
pending
further
consideration
of
what
the
just
and
reasonable
price
may
be.
so
the
problem
faced
in
these
cases
is
how
to
determine
the
price
line
for
the
interim
period
that
is
fair
and
reasonable
while
avoiding
protracted
proceedings
that
necessarily
accompany
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
commission
has
utilized
a
in-line
pricing
approach
which
was
fashioned
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
teachings
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
united
gas
improvement
company
against
federal
power
commission
which
was
decided
in
1960
and
has
been
--
was
at
that
time
followed
by
three
other
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
that
case
pretty
well
sets
forth
the
standards
have
been
followed.
there
the
ninth
circuit
stated
that
the
price
line
is
intended
to
reflect
current
conditions
in
the
industry.
therefore,
comparable
prices
upon
which
it
is
based
must
be
prices
under
which
a
substantial
amount
of
natural
gas
presently
moves
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
all
the
court
cases
since
that
time
with
the
exception
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
this
case,
including
this
court
in
callery
have
recognized
that
this
in-line
price
should
reflect
current
market
conditions.
at
the
same
time,
the
ninth
circuit
in
what
is
referred
to
as
the
ugi
case
held
that
the
commission
could
not
simply
look
at
the
prices
--
contemporaneous
prices
at
--
in
the
area
without
recognizing
that
some
of
those
prices
were
in
itself
the
result
of
improper
commission
action.
but
specifically,
what
had
occurred
in
the
ugi
cases
was
that
the
commission
had
approved
22-cent
prices
in
a
very
--
in
various
prior
proceedings
and
then
it
looked
at
those
prices
to
approve
the
price
involved
in
that
case.
but
the
earlier
22-cent
prices
had
all
resulted
and
had
all
leapfrogged
up
to
that
level
because
of
the
commission's
improper
decision
in
the
catco
case
where
it
had
approved
price
of
about
21-and-a-half
cents
even
though
before
that
time,
all
the
prices
in
the
area
was
substantially
less.
so
in
the
ugi
case,
the
court
formulated
what's
been
known
as
the
suspect
price
stock
during
that
the
commission
cannot
simply
simply
accept
its
face
value
prices
which
appeared
to
have
leapfrogged
as
result
of
prior
commission
errors.
but
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
also
rejected
a
contention
by
the
distributor
groups
that
the
commission
couldn't
consider
any
prices
other
than
those
which
had
received
full
commission
approval
in
a
--
in
a
adjudicated
hearing
type
of
case.
what
they
were
thinking
of
there
was
that
in
many
instances,
that
there
is
no
objection,
the
commission
will
issue
permanent
certificates
at
the
prices
that
it
deems
appropriate.
the
ninth
circuit
said
if
you
couldn't
look
at
any
of
those
prices,
you
would
simply
have
a
rollback
of
prices
because
there
would
might
not
be
any
substantial
volumes
of
gas
that
you
could
look
at
to
determine
what
the
current
market
conditions
were.
now,
following
the
ugi
cases,
the
commission
itself
never
treated
the
suspect
price
doctrine
as
the
case
which
precluded
the
commission
from
giving
any
effect
to
prices
which
had
not
been
finally
approved.
thus,
in
the
skelly
case
which
i've
referred
to
in
connection
in
one
of
the
refund
question,
the
commission
stated
that
it
had
given
some
or
be
it
discounted
way
to
temporary
authorizations.
but
until
the
cases
that
at
least
the
amerada
case
here
involved,
most
of
the
early
cases
there
had
in
fact
been
substantial
volumes
of
gas
that
had
moved
at
prices
that
near
the
--
near
the
line
that
commission
determined.
there
are
a
fair
number
of
non-suspected
prices.
in
amerada,
the
situation
was
quite
different,
only
about
90
--
about
90%
of
the
gas
in
the
area
during
the
period
of
time
covered
by
the
contracts
at
issue
was
flowing
under
temporary
certificates,
and
most
of
these
were
prices
from
16
to
18
cents.
there
were
a
few
prices,
few
sales
but
not
really
very
small
volumes
which
are
at
lower
prices.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
“seaboard
interests”
during
this
period
of
time
were
challenging
all
prices
above
the
14-and-a-half
to
15-cent
levels,
so
the
commission
foreclosed
from
issuing
permanent
certificates
and
a
situation
developed
where
the
commission
would
be
unable
to
make
any
assessment
of
current
conditions
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
prices
in
the
area.
because
no
substantial
volumes
of
gas
could
be
looked
at,
that
is
if
we
accepted
the
position
of
the
“seaboard
interests”.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
may
add
that
the
commission
with
the
approval
of
this
court
held
that
the
cost
evidence
should
not
be
considered
in
these
cases
because
that
would
simply
preclude
the
possibility
of
an
in-line
determination
before
the
just
and
reasonable
determination.
the
commission
did
not
in
these
circumstances
think
it
appropriate
to
ignore
temporary
authorizations
or
some
of
the
contract
prices.
but
it
took
a
middle
course,
it
looked
at
all
the
market
contract
price
evidence
in
the
area
and
it
carefully
examined
them.
it
looked
that
the
trends
between
the
period
before
the
policy
statement
and
the
period
after
the
policy
statement
and
it
discounted
the
effect
of
the
pricing
because
it
recognized
as
had
the
court
in
the
ugi
case
that
some
of
the
prices
in
the
area
were
obviously
the
result
of
market
distortions
stemming,
one,
from
the
fact
that
the
pipeline
cost
--
pipeline
purchases
are
have
--
have
imperfect
bargaining
motivations
to
keep
the
prices
down
and
secondly
that
there
had
been
some
commission
action
which
may
have
tended
to
move
up
prices.
so,
on
other
hand,
it
also
did
not
think
it
appropriate
to
base
its
in-line
determination
only
on
those
prices
to
which
the
consumer
interests
had
not
objected
because
if
it
had
done
that,
it
would
simply
have
been
rubberstamping
one
individual
parties
or
one
group
of
parties'
view
as
to
what
the
market
conditions
should
be.
and
in
the
commission's
view,
the
assessment
on
a
balance
basis
should
be
made
by
the
neutral
regulatory
agency
which
has
been
assigned
this
task
by
the
congress.
mr.
peter

there's
no

mr.
peter

none
at
all.
mr.
peter

it's
an
application,
some
of
which
are
in
the

here
which
says
we
have

mr.

some

of

mr.
peter

yes,
in

temporary
(voice

well,
the
commission
will
--
if
the
price
is
above
what
the
commission
has
said
to
be
the
guideline
price,
the
commission
will
condition
it
down.
it
will
not

at

is
within

those
are

mr.

that's

mr.

the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
holding
that
the
commission
had
improperly
looked
at
these
temporary
authorizations
in
two
of
the
areas
involved,
based
its
decision
in
good
part
on
the
view
that
current
market
conditions
were
simply
irrelevant
and
it
derived
that
interpretation
from
the
fact
that
in
this
court
in
callery
had
affirmed
the
exclusion
of
cost
in
economic
evidence.
but
it
overlooked
the
fact
that
that
exclusion
was
to
permit
the
--
was
for
administrative
purposes.
that
it
was
a
matter
of
administrative
necessity
that
the
commission
not
look
at
this
evidence
which
the
commission
itself
after
a
series
of
hearings
had
concluded
would
not
be
useful
unless
they
were
expanded
into
full
blown
rate
proceedings.
certainly
nothing
in
the
commission's
opinion
or
in
this
court's
opinion
in
callery
that
at
all
suggests
that
the
line
should
not
be
based
on
current
conditions.
to
the
contrary,
this
court's
opinion
in
callery
says
that
the
line
appropriately
relates
to
contemporaneous
sales
in
the
area.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
also
based
its
decision
in
part
on
the
fact
that
it
thought
that
they
would
--
that
even
though
they
might
be
a
freeze
in
the
line
under
its
view
which
it
recognized
that
there
might
be,
that
the
producers
would
be
protected
by
being
able
to
avail
themselves
of
the
right
to
file
increased
rates
after
the
date
of
the
commission's
order.
but
we
think
that
this
approach
of
the
court
relying
on
the
increased
rate
provisions
of
the
act
is
not
only
unfair
to
the
producers
for
reasons
that
i
believe
the
producer
counsels
will
explain
some
detail.
but
that
it
--
this
would
not
have
implemented
the
interests
of
the
consumer
in
the
best
way
possible
in
our
view.
the
one
purpose
of
in-line
pricing
was
to
discourage
the
filing
of
increased
rates.
and
the
commission
experienced
at
the
time
of
the
decisions
in
these
cases
was
that
if
the
commission
made
an
in-line
determination
which
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
reflect
market
conditions,
producers
would
not
file
for
increased
rates
thereafter
at
this
in-line
price.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
were
an
artificially
low
in-line
price,
predicated
solely
on
the
fact
that
increased
rates
could
be
filed
any
event,
there
were
the
substantial
chance
that
thereafter
there
would
be
increased
rate
filings
even
higher
levels.
and
of
course
those
would
be
passed
on
to
the
consumers
and
while
there
is
a
refund
remedy
under
the
act
and
while
we
think
this
is
useful,
this
court
has
repeatedly
agreed
with
us
that
the
protection
to
consumers
from
refunds
is
far
from
perfect.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
commission
in
these
--
making
these
various
in-line
determinations
recognized
that
it
could
not
simply
accept
the
contract
prices,
the
temporarily
certificated
prices
at
face
value.
this
had
been
the
voice
of
the
commission's
orders
in
the
ugi
cases
which
had
been
referred.
but
the
commission
in
these
cases
did
not
accept
them
at
face
value.
for
example,
in
amerada,
the
commission
found
that
the
weighted
contract
average
of
all
the
post-policy
statement
prices
was
about
17.2
cents
and
it
found
that
the
much
of
the
gas
was
flowing
up
--
at
prices
up
to
18
cents.
but
the
in-line
price
that
the
commission
determined
was
16
cents.
again,
in
texas
district
3
in
the
sinclair
case
which
i
may
say
is
likely
different
because
in
that
case,
there
were
in
fact
substantial
volumes
of
gas
and
the
majority
of
the
gas
was
flowing
under
permanent
certificates.
and
the
commission's
opinion
shows
on
its
face
that
the
commission
looked
principally
at
the
permanent
certificates.
now,
on
that
instance,
there
were
--
40%
of
the
gas
flowing
under
permanent
certificates
was
being
sold
at
18
cents.
new
york
or
the
“seaboard
interests”
suggest
that
this
18-cent
price
should
be
suspect
because
it
was
at
a
level
that
if
it
had
thought
about
it,
it
would
have
objected
too,
but
it
didn't
object
to
it
at
the
time
that
the
prices
were
approved.
yet,
the
commission
didn't
allow
an
18-cent
line
but
in
this
instance
it
allowed
a
17-cent
line.
in
the
case
where
the
evidence
showed
that
looking
solely
at
permanent
certificates,
the
weighted
average
price
from
the
period
before
the
issuance
of
the
policy
statement
to
the
period
after
the
issuance
of
the
policy
statement
had
risen
by
a
cent.
now,
there
is
one
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
on
these
cases
and
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
“seaboard
interests”
that
in
someway,
the
commission
has
applied
a
different
standards
in
the
cases
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast
from
the
standards
that
had
been
applied
in
cases
relating
to
south
louisiana.
and
the
basis
for
this
suggestion
is
that
in
south
louisiana,
the
commission
in
a
number
of
cases
has
found
that
the
line
which
was
originally
determined
for
the
period
at
which
the
sales
were
made
in
1956,
that's
the
catco
sale
of
20
cents,
has
not
changed
even
through
the
end
of
1962.
this
is
perfectly
true.
but
in
the
last
of
those
cases
which
was
called
the
union
texas
case
before
the
commission
and
the
pan
american
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
which
is
pending
here
on
the
refund
question
principally
and
also
on
one
price
element,
the
commission's
opinion
shows
that
the
commission
there
looked
at
temporary
authorizations.
it
compared
the
weighted
average
prices
under
permanent
certificates
from
--
to
the
--
in
the
different
years.
and
it
also
looked
and
examined
the
weighted
average
price
of
the
temporary
authorizations.
on
the
basis
of
its
analysis
of
the
fact
in
that
case,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
evidence
which
is
the
same
type
of
evidence
that
was
considered
here
simply
didn't
show
a
change
in
the
price
line.
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
it's
considered
appraisal
of
the
evidence
there
but
the
same
of
type
of
evidence
lead
it
to
a
different
result,
because
in
fact
there
it
concluded
that
the
price
line
for
the
periods
after
the
policy
statement
were
with,
in
each
of
the
three
areas,
they
sent
higher
than
the
price
line
that
it
had
determined
for
the
prior
period.
but
obviously,
a
different
result
resulting
from
a
reasonable
considered
assessment
of
the
record
in
each
case
doesn't
show
any
inconsistency.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
the
permian
basin
decision,
the
commission
said
that
the
--
it
would
use
the
just
and
reasonable
price
as
the
in-line
price.
but
also,
in
a
case
coming
from
the
permian
basin,
and
it's
pending
in
this
court
but
i
don't
remember
the
number.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
did
the
same
thing.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
it
--
in
the
commission's
view,
the
--
if
there
is
to
be
any
change
in
the
in-line
price,
it
will
have
to
be
by
showing
that
there
had
been
some
changes
in
the
factors
which
make
up
the
just
and
reasonable
determination.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
at
least
as
to
the
prospective
just
and
reasonable
price.
as
you
recall,
we
fixed
both
an
old
gas
price
and
the
new
gas
price
and
new
certificates
would
presumably
call
for
a
new
gas
price
which
might
be
adjusted.
but
that
is
what
the
commission
contemplates
doing
in
--
as
soon
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
determined.
and
in
this
case,
or
in
these
areas,
the
commission
is
no
longer
setting
down
anymore
in-line
proceedings
of
the
type
here
involved
because
the
just
and
reasonable
--
the
cases
involving
just
and
reasonable
rates
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast
and
south
louisiana
had
so
for
advance
that
it
would
seemed
to
be
the
wise
course
to
let
our
in-line
determination
rest
on
the
determination
in
those
area
rate
proceedings.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they
will
continue
in
effect
and
they
will
be
subject
to
refund.
in
part,
depending
on
this
court's
decision,
in
part
not,
the
--
all
the
sales
in
the
south
louisiana
area
since
about
the
middle
of
1964
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
express
refund
condition
and
since
early
1967,
all
temporaries
are
issued
with
a
refund
condition
which
has
a
floor
of
2
cents
below
either
the
guideline
price
or
the
in-line
price
whichever
is
lower.
and
the
commission
has
viewed
that
that
floor
would
be
certainly
--
would
tend
to
be
low
enough
not
to
pose
any
problems
thereafter.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
--
i
may
have
misspoken
myself
before
you,
but
i
think
that
question
before
related
to
refunds,
if
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
if
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
won't
order
further
refunds
in
the
cases
involved
here
because
those
sales
will
then
have
been
permanently
certificated.
in
the
texas
district
3
case,
the
superior
oil
company
makes
a
number
of
challenges
to
the
commission's
price
line
being
too
high
--
too
low,
excuse
me.
principally,
they
argue
that
we
should
have
relied
on
some
high-priced
gas
being
sold
at
20
cents.
as
to
that
argument,
the
commission
said
that
we
would
give
some
weight
to
those.
but
in
those
cases,
the
“seaboard
interests”
i
think
specifically
the
new
york
commission
had
been
denied
intervention
the
commission
proceedings,
it
then
went
to
court,
but
it
chose
the
wrong
the
time
to
challenge
its
exclusion
of
interventions
and
its
petition
for
review
was
dismissed
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
nevertheless,
it
was
apparent
to
the
commission
that
those
20-cent
prices
were
higher
than
the
commission
would
have
allowed
or
should've
allowed
at
that
time
that
what
before
this
procedural
clerk
it
would
not
have
been
allowed.
and
therefore
those
prices
should
certainly
not
betaken
as
reflecting
the
line,
in
other
words,
be
given
the
full
weight.
the
commission
gave
discounted
weight
to
that.
i
would
like
to
say
that
superior
has
mad
a
number
of
arguments
which
it
did
not
make
to
the
commission
and
it
has
suggested
in
its
reply
brief
but
these
arguments,
but
we
weren't
specific,
they
were
generally
encompassed
within
our
arguments.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
under
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
19
(b)
of
the
gas
act
which
requires
objections
not
--
requires
all
objections
that
to
be
raised
in
court
have
to
be
made
specifically
in
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
commission,
that
in
light
of
those
cases,
the
superior's
objections
may
not
be
considered.
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
objections
have
far
involved
in
a
few
other
cases
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
some
of
them
not
considering
low
price
sales,
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
fifth
circuit.
but
i
do
think
that
--
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
we
think
it's
important
that
parties
to
commission
cases
do
a
price
the
commission
specifically
of
the
objections
that
they
are
urging
so
that
the
commission
will
be
given
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
those
in
the
orders
on
rehearing
and
so
that
if
cases
do
come
to
court,
the
court
rather
than
being
asked
to
pass
on
questions
without
any
prior
commission
consideration,
that
it
have
the
commission's
consideration.
of
course
this
court
has
viewed
that
requirement
as
strict
statutory
bar
to
consideration
and
we
would
urge
that
that
interpretation
be
continued.
on
the
in-line
question,
finally,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
commission
recognized
that
it
had
a
very
difficult
evidentiary
problem.
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
evidence
that
it
had
to
consider
was
far
from
what
might
be
ideal
in
showing
current
market
conditions.
obviously,
it
did
not.
the
ideal
evidence
has
caused
an
economic
evidence
which
is
introduced
in
the
just
and
reasonable
cases
if
it
was
going
to
do
its
job,
it
couldn't
look
at
that.
but
we
suggest
that
the
commission
did
a
careful
reasonably
considered
assessment
of
the
evidence
at
hand
and
since
it
did
not
consider
materials
which
should
have
been
excluded,
we
request
that
the
commission's
in-line
determination
in
each
of
these
three
cases
--
commission
cases
be
sustained.
now
finally,
there
is
an
issue
in
the
two
cases
arising
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
this
is
the
issue
which
has
been
referred
to
as
the
question
of
need.
and
the
question
specifically
is
whether
the
commission
in
considering
each
independent
producer
application
must
specifically
determine
on
an
evidentiary
basis
in
each
instance
that
there
is
public
need
for
the
gas
that
each
producer
proposes
to
sell.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
that
--
that
issue
was
not
presented
in
the
--
in
the
tenth
circuit
case.
it
has
arisen
in
another
case
in
the
--
the
continental
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit,
where
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
commission's
view
that
the
question
of
need
may
should
appropriately
be
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings
rather
than
in
the
individual
producer
proceeding.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
seemed
to
hold
that
as
a
theoretical
matter,
this
question
of
need
should
be
disposed
within
the
producer
cases,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
recognized
that
really,
you
couldn't
do
it
in
the
producer
cases
and
they
said
that
we
are
not
requiring
an
extensive
hearing
in
each
producer
case,
but
that's
the
--
the
commission
should
make
in
its
view,
references
to
other
cases
to
informal
staff
studies,
to
policy
statements
whenever
it
decides
producer
cases.
and
i
may
say
that
while
--
we
did
not
seek
certiorari
on
the
question.
we
think
that
the
court
was
wrong,
but
we
also
thought
that
administratively,
it
might
be
possible
for
the
commission
to
comply
with
what
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
indicated.
although,
i
will
be
very
frank
in
saying
that
we're
not
sure
what
useful
public
interest
would
be
served
by
doing
what
the
d.c.
circuit
has
said
instead
of
the
commission's
present
procedures.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
read
from
the
court's
decision
which
is
in
volume
4
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
starting
at
page
265
from
the
pagination
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
this
is
the
pagination
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
justice
black.
the
court
says
that,
“although
we
remand
this
case
so
that
the
fpc
can
consider
the
issue
of
public
need,
we
recognize
an
obvious
tension
between
the
statutory
requirement
that
it
do
so
and
administrative
feasibility.
the
public
convenience
in
necessity
includes
many
considerations,
but
there
--
if
there
is
to
be
any
effective
certification
of
the
producers,
the
fpc
must
sometimes
stop
short
of
the
ideal.
it
is
evident
too
that
the
fpc
must
have
great
latitude
in
its
choice
of
procedures.”
we
are
not
demanding
the
fpc
hold
a
long
complex
hearing
in
each
case
--
in
each
of
its
many
producer
application
cases.
but
it
does
not
seem
too
difficult
to
have
the
producer's
customers
or
the
pipeline's
customers
testified
by
the
take-or-pay
situation
regarding
the
broader
aspects
of
the
nature
of
the
gas
business
or
of
conservation,
the
fpc
may
consider
studies
of
its
staff,
may
after
study
issue
policy
statements.
and
it
goes
on
a
little
later
and
says,
“then
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
relitigate
need
in
each
issue.
the
fpc
need
only
show
that
the
broad
statement
or
study
covers
the
particular
certification
before
it”.
in
short,
we
do
not
now
prescribe
any
particular
method
for
deciding
need,
nor,
as
our
discussion
of
what
public
need
means
exhaustive.
and
it
indicates
that
these
decisions
should
be
made
before
the
gas
starts
coming
into
the
market.
and
this
seems
to
be
--
this
is
an
undesirable
objective
but
the
suggestions
of
the
“seaboard
interests”
and
i
think
in
this
instance,
particularly
the
new
york
commission
that
this
can
be
met
by
looking
at
the
need
question
with
respect
to
producer
applications,
where
most
of
the
sales
of
previously
commenced
under
temporary
authorizations
is
totally
unrealistic.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
--
yes
justice
harlan
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
commission
did
not
seek
cert
even
though
there
seems
to
be
a
ostensible
conflict
between
that
decision
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
said
that
if
the
commission
consider
its
need,
then
in
the
producer
cases,
considers
at
the
way
the
new
york
commission
was
urging,
that
it
be
considered,
it
would
have
to
be
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
commission.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
effect
said
put
in
the
paragraph
in
your
order.
we
thought
that
we
--
we
couldn't
live
with
that.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
it
is
very
useful.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
get
to.
the
--
when
gas
is
sold
by
producers,
it
of
course
has
to
be
picked
up
by
pipelines
though
jurisdictional
facilities.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
plain
at
the
outset
because
it
may
have
been
somewhat
misleading
in
our
brief
not
every
producers
sale
has
a
corresponding
pipeline
certificate
proceeding.
in
this
case,
we
have
examined
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
files
and
i'd
say
that
it
--
in
about
75%
of
the
gas,
there
were
actually
some
new
pipeline
facilities
that
were
needed
to
pick
up
the
gas
involved.
now,
the
commission
approved
gas
purchasing
facilities
in
one
of
several
ways.
there
have
--
there
are
many
pipeline
expansion
cases
and
frequently
of
course,
these
include
request
to
build
into
a
particular
field
and
to
purchase
particular
supplies
of
gas.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
many
--
most
of
these
pipelines
have
come
into
the
commission
and
request
what
is
known
as
the
budget
type
certificate.
now,
under
the
budget
type
certificate,
the
company
is
authorized
to
attach
new
supplies
of
gas
in
the
following
year
provided
that
the
facilities
themselves
are
reasonably
inexpensive.
the
--
now
the
--
however,
the
commission's
consideration
of
need
is
not
restricted
to
these
because
the
commission
requires
detailed
information
to
be
filed
by
the
pipeline
companies
with
respect
to
what
their
--
what
gas
is
being
sold
throughout
the
country.
the
deliverability
under
these
supplies
and
then
--
it's
very
detailed
information
which
shows
where
the
gas
is
coming
from.
the
commission
has
required
this
since
1964
and
the
staff
of
the
commission
examines
these
reports
and
is
then
in
the
position
to
determine
at
least
in
its
view
whether
the
company
supply
is
adequate
or
inadequate
and
it
has
advised,
called
in
the
pipelines
to
try
to
explain
why
isn't
there
enough
gas
here.
in
other
situations,
we
have
called
the
pipelines
in
to
explain,
why
are
you
paying
for
gas
which
you
are
not
taking.
these
are
the
prepayments
that
the
new
york
commission
refers
to.
so
that
there
is
a
continuing
surveillance
by
the
commission,
all
this
question
of
need,
both
inadequacy
and
perhaps
the
oversupply
although
in
the
past,
to
a
large
extent,
the
problems
are
related
to
insufficient
supplies.
however,
in
1964,
the
commission
did
recognize
--
the
commission
up
to
1964
had
a
policy
that
you
had
to
have
enough
deliverability,
enough
gas
to
assure
that
you
could
serve
your
markets
for
12
years.
this
meant
that
the
pipelines
would
have
to
go
out
and
buy
enough
gas
to
meet
this
requirement
even
though
they
may
--
might
be
taking
some
gas
that
they
might
not
need
at
that
particular
time.
the
commission
at
the
same
time
that
it
imposed
the
reporting
requirement,
detailed
reporting
requirement
with
respect
to
gas
supplies,
announced
that
it
was
relaxing
this
firm
12-year
deliverability
requirement
and
more
recently,
this
year,
it
has
indicated
that
as
a
result
of
this
realization,
it
appears
that
the
prepayment
problem
has
diminished
to
some
extent
because
this
gives
the
pipelines
greater
flexibility.
but
in
essence
then,
the
commission
reviews
the
supply
problem
on
this
informal
basis
and
also
in
the
formal
cases
and
of
course,
in
many
of
these
pipeline
expansion
cases,
it
looks
at
what
is
needed
by
the
ultimate
market.
it
looks
at
questions
of
conservation,
of
end-use,
increasing
in
the
question
of
whether
gas
should
be
used
to
--
for
oil
or
fuel
by
electric
generation,
generating
plants,
it's
an
issue
which
the
commission
has
to
face
up
to.
and
in
these
formal
proceedings,
it
is
our
view
that
there
is
ample
opportunity
for
any
of
the
parties
who
feel
that
the
gas
supplies
either
inadequate
of
more
than
adequate.
there's
ample
opportunity
for
them
to
participate
and
request
that
the
commission
put
the
consideration
into
a
formal
record
and
that
all
the
parties
put
the
matters
into
a
formal
record.
it
is
also
perfectly
plain
that
even
if
the
question
of
need
were
to
be
considered
in
a
producer
application,
that
the
evidence
relating
to
what
the
--
for
the
need
for
this
gas
would
have
to
come
from
the
pipelines
who
would
know
what
their
need
is
and
perhaps
from
the
pipelines
customers,
because
plainly,
this
is
not
information
which
--
to
which
the
producers
themselves
are
previewed.
and
this
seems
to
be
conceded
but,
it
says
while
this
isn't
too
difficult,
you
can
then
--
they
can
call
the
pipeline
witnesses.
we
suggest
that
the
procedure
which
the
distributors
urge
which
is
much
broader,
i
may
say,
than
the
procedure
which
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
seemed
to
envision,
would
enable
any
purchasing
customer,
any
other
interested
party
who
would
be
entitled
to
intervene
in
the
commission
proceeding
to
in
effect
force
the
commission
to
convert
any
given
producer
case
into
what
would
amount
to
a
national
gas
survey.
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
one
can
really
draw
the
line
once
the
floodgate
is
opened.and
of
course,
if
this
were
--
if
this
had
happened
in
these
cases,
the
commission
had
accepted
that
proposition
in
these
cases,
it
could
not
have
decided
the
in-line
question
in
any
expeditious
fashion.
we
suggest
that
the
argument
that
need
be
considered
here
at
the
request
of
the
consumer
interest
is
really
no
different
from
the
request
which
was
turned
down
in
the
callery
cases
that
the
producers
are
entitled
to
demonstrate
the
supply
and
demand
situation
by
extensive
evidence.
these
are
the
opposite
sides
of
the
coin
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
completely
correct
in
saying
that
the
decision
in
callery
approving
the
commission's
administrative
judgment
as
to
in-line
cases
should
also
be
followed
here.
perhaps
one
word
should
be
said
about
what
these
prepayments
are.
there's
been
a
--
before
the
commission,
the
only
specific
question
of
with
respect
to
need
that
was
raised
by
the
consumer
interest
was
the
allegation
that
some
of
the
pipelines
involved
had
large
prepayment
balances.
producers
sell
to
pipelines
under
long
term
contracts
and
they
are
normally
obligations
under
which
the
pipelines
must
take
a
certain
amount
of
gas
which
is
usually
related
to
the
reserves
underlying
the
contract
or
else
pay
for
it.
however,
this
doesn't
mean
that
if
--
if
you
pay
for
some
gas
not
taken,
that
there's
an
immediate
forfeitures.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
has
had
virtually
no
situations
of
any
forfeiture.
and
there
is
a
period
in
which
the
pipelines
can
make
up
the
gas
previously
paid
for
and
not
taken.
during
this
period
of
make
up,
the
amount
of
money
that
has
been
paid
out
is
included
in
the
pipelines
rate
face,
essentially
its
working
capital
so
that
there
is
then
--
a
return
would
be
earned
on
that
and
this
could
have
some
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
rate
case.
however,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
and
it
is
really
quite
in
the
nature
of
the
gas
producing
business
that
at
times,
a
pipeline
will
have
to
buy
gas
a
little
bit
before
it
needs
all
of
that
to
assure
that
it
has
the
adequate
deliverability
when
its
existing
reserves
start
declining.
in
addition
to
that,
most
pipelines
have
had
rapid
expansion
and
they
have
to
go
out
and
buy
gas
to
make
sure
that
they
will
be
able
to
meet
their
commitments
in
the
future,
because
gas
unlike
staple
products,
has
to
be
bought
when
it
can
be
found
and
at
particular
location.
and
of
course,
some
gas
supplies
are
much
better
than
other
gas
supplies
because
they
are
near
existing
pipelines
and
can
be
utilized
more
efficiently.
so
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
commission
said
that
there
are
sometimes
some
slight
prepayment
situations.
in
some
instances,
although
in
only
one
instance
here,
a
pipeline
has
a
substantial
prepayment
situation
and
that's
united
gas
pipeline
company.
and
most
of
the
gas
which
was
being
sold
that
it
involved
in
these
cases,
is
no
longer
being
sold.
and
then
an
authorization
was
approved
for
that,
so
very
little
gas
to
that
pipeline
company
is
now
at
issue
here.
but
however
that
may
be,
an
in
depth
study
of
the
question
of
whether
a
pipeline
needs
the
gas
to
meet
its
actual
delivery
requirements,
a
question
which
is
not
directly
related
to
whether
or
not
its
--
in
the
past
for
example,
it
has
had
to
pay
for
some
gas
it
couldn't
use.
in
itself
would
present
a
complex
problem
which
would
greatly
complicate
--
would
have
complicated
these
in-line
proceedings.
and
we
think
that
the
commission's
view
that
questions
this
type
are
appropriately
to
be
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings
both
to
the
informal
methods
i've
described
and
through
formal
hearing
procedures
is
plainly
reasonable
in
the
proper
exercise
of
the
commission's
regulatory
functions.
for
these
reasons,
we
asked
that
all
the
commission
orders
here
under
review
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice.
briefly,
i
think
i
should
make
it
clear
on
the
--
with
respect
to
refunds,
that
first,
we
do
believe
that
the
--
without
prejudice
language
in
the
temporaries,
certainly
shows
the
non-finality
of
the
rates
which
were
permitted
to
be
charged
under
the
temporary
authorization.
at
the
same
time,
if
i
did
not
make
this
clear
yesterday,
the
commission
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
with
respect
to
in-liners
has
changed
its
view
as
to
the
equity
of
ordering
refunds
where
there
has
been
no
express
conditions
stating
that
refunds
would
not
be
required
at
the
end.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
think,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
--
it's
certainly
our
action
is
contrary
to
our
or
the
commission's
view
on
the
equities
in
that
order.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities
in
the
february
5th
order
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities
in
the
skelly
case
which
was
decided
by
the
commission
in
august
of
1962.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
opinion
is
as
i
read
it
and
it's
consistently
with
your
earlier
decision
is
not
that
the
commissions
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
of
these
even
without
the
expressed
refund
condition.
it
is
a
view
that
the
commission
at
that
time
did
not
think
it
would
be
equitable
to
order
refunds.
subsequently,
had
the
consequence
no
doubt,
of
the
reversal
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
skelly
case
and
upon
a
more
considered
in
depth
consideration
of
the
equities,
the
commission
concluded
that
although
it
assumed
that
the
producers
reasonably
relied
on
the
lack
of
refund
condition
in
the
belief
that
they
would
not
have
to
order
refunds,
the
commission
then
concluded
that
it
would
be
equitable
to
order
refunds.
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
a
change
in
the
commission's
view
of
the
equities.
and
then
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
and
--
and
if
--
i
don't
think
that
order
really
makes
any
difference
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
let
me
get
to
it.
the
temporaries
in
this
case
were
issued
in
service
commenced
long
before
this
february
5th
order
was
entered.
the
commission's
action
in
--
the
distributors
in
the
motion
which
led
up
to
this
order,
requested
the
commission
alternatively
to
either
vacate
the
temporaries
that
had
been
issued
or
else
to
impose
a
prospective
refund
condition.
in
that
motion,
the
distributors
pointed
out
that
they
were
challenging
in
court
the
power
of
the
commission
or
the
propriety
of
the
commission
not
ordering
refunds
and
not
imposing
refund
conditions.
the
commission
in
its
february
5th
order
said
that
because
service
had
already
commenced,
it
did
not
regard
it
as
appropriate
to
vacate
these
temporaries
because
before
you
could
stop
service
with
respect
to
flowing
gas,
the
commission
should
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
abandonment
was
justified.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
fair
play
if
we
now
after
service
had
commenced
change
the
terms
of
service.
i
don't
believe,
i'm
not
sure,
but
in
my
view,
that
order
was
in
the
context
of
a
contention
that
the
commission
has
a
power
to
order
refunds
in
any
event
and
all
the
commission
was
doing
here
is
saying
we
still
think
that
it
isn't
equitable
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
i
think
it
--
i
think
the
commission
would
have
been
wrong
in
construing
that
it
did
not
have
the
power.
i
don't
think
that
that
order
was
strictly
reviewable
at
that
time
because
the
service
was
already
flowing
and
it
really
related
to
the
consequences
it
would
have
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
i
don't
think
that
the
february
5th
order
changed
the
consequences
or
the
situation
that
existed
prior
to
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
it
was
a
wrong
construction
that
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
construction
--
i
think
that
construction,
if
that
was
a
construction
that
we
had
no
power
to
order
refunds
would
be
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
under
those
conditions,
would
be
an
interlocutory
interpretation
by
the
commission
which
was
not
binding
even
upon
the
commission
and
was
not
viewed
as
the
commission's
interpretation
in
the
later
order.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
very
definitely,
i
think
the
commission
has
the
power
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
even
under
the
conditions
that
it
had
not
imposed
an
expressed
refund
condition
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
yesterday,
i
think
in
effect
that
because
of
the
prior
history
of
refund
conditions
and
no
refund
conditions,
that
you
virtually
have
to
get
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
order
refunds
where
there
is
a
tentative
rate
even
if
it
had
said
we
do
not
intend
to
order
refunds.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
this
february
5th
order
was
after
these
certificates
were
issued
or
it's
long
after
the
time
when
they
had
commenced
service
under
those
certificates.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
the
--
oh,
the
commission
takes
a
view
and
i
take
the
view
that
the
certificate
holders
--
because
not
just
because
of
this
order,
but
also
because
other
commission
orders
in
this
period
had
the
right
to
believe
that
they
would
not
be
required
to
make
refunds
and
the
commission
in
the
order
in
its
opinion
501
where
it
did
order
refunds
expressly
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
had
been
reasonable
reliance.
but
it
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
producers
when
given
an
opportunity
to
show
any
detriment
from
that
reliance
had
failed
to
do
so
except
with
a
very
limited
area
of
royalties
which
was
specifically
paid
out
on
reliance
on
the
higher
price
and
certain
state
production
taxes.
and
it
is
our
view
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
differentiated
from
callery
which
i
think
it's
illegal
for
callery,
we
think
on
a
legal
proposition
is
certainly
controlling.
but
in
terms
of
equity,
the
commission's
course
of
conduct
here
may
have
been
such
as
to
induce
the
producers
to
pay
out
certain
specific
sums
which
it
would
not
otherwise
have
paid
out.
and
we
based
on
our
decision
on
that
assumption.
but
beyond
that,
we
think
that
has
to
be
reliance
and
a
detriment
from
that
reliance.
and
the
producers
simply
haven't
shown
any
detriment
except
in
the
very
limited
circumstances
i've
made.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh!
yes.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
opinion
501
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
it's
ordered
a
refund,
opinion
501
which
is
in
this
small
section
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
this
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
there
had
been
a
series
of
other
cases
where
the
commission
has
ordered
refunds
in
comparable
circumstances.
there
is
the
case
which
is
pending
here
from
the
tenth
circuit,
pan
american
case
which
relates
to
a
commission
proceeding
involving
many
south
louisiana
sales.
i
believe
that
in
that
case,
there
was
an
order
similar
to
the
february
5th
order.
the
commission
has
ordered
re
--
well,
it
hasn't
ordered
refunds
there
yet.
but
it
has
again,
said
that
this
called
for
hearings
to
determine
the
equities.
but
it
has
now
ordered
refunds
in
the
hawkins
case
which
is
the
texas
district
3
case.
that
case
is
pending
in
the
tenth
circuit.
it
has
ordered
refunds
in
the
case
relating
to
sun
oil.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
one
--
in
one
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
referred
to
yesterday,
i
think
it's
hawkins.
there
was
a
situation
where
a
producer
showed
and
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief,
produced
to
show
that
these
very
large
--
that
he
had
very
large
refunds
in
relation
to
his
own
operations.
and
that
this,
if
he
was
required
to
make
refunds
immediately,
might
cause
them
difficulties
even
though
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
could
be
spread
out
over
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
in
this
respect,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
that
early
skelly
case,
agreed
with
us
that
we
should
consider
the
equity.
and
the
equities
there
were
--
that
were
presented
to
them,
there
was
in
fact
that
there
had
been
no
specific
refund
obligation
and
the
judge
fahy
in
writing
that
opinion,
recognized
as
the
commission
has
here
that
the
commission
had
not
followed
the
straightest
line
in
these
matters
and
that
we
had
to
take
this
into
account.
i
may
say
that
there
was
an
argument,
i
think
both
by
the
counsels
here
and
there's
an
amicus
brief
which
suggest
that
the
commission
has
a
declared
law
which
may
producers
were
entitled
to
rely
upon.
whatever
that
means
here,
the
commission
accepted
the
reliance
but
it
didn't
find
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
that
is
the
situa
--
well
that
is
the
situation
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
maybe
i
have
--
i
better
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
if
the
commission
had
fixed
a
16-cent
which
is
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
and
you
now
were
--
remanded
and
(voice
overlap)
ultimately
would
be
15.
i
think
that
would
still
be
callery.
i
think
it
would
just
change
the
measure
of
refunds
but
it
wouldn't
change
the
legal
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh!
we
approved
the
original
rate
in
the
--
in
the
original
certificate
just
as
much
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
had
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
proper
certificate
price
when
we
issued
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
callery,
that
those
were
the
cases
that
were
set
aside
in
the
ugi
case
but
we
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
agreed
upon
in
this
--
well,
that
--
that
was
a
rate
that
the
contract
rates
and
we
simply
didn't
lower
it
in
that
sense.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
i
don't
think
in
terms
of
say
the
arizona
grocery
case
of
reparations
that
these
are
--
these
were
any
different.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
without
specifically
approving
rates?
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case
indicates
that
the
commission
must
give
careful
scrutiny
to
the
rates
of
the
commission
if
it
wants
to
give
scrutiny
to
the
rates
in
the
certificate
case
then
of
course
has
discretion
in
large
measure
to
determine
whether
it
will
have
a
rate
hearing.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
it
approved
them
in
the
sense
that
these
were
the
rates
that
could
legally
be
charged,
that
if
by
the
producer
by
charging
them
could
not
have
been
held
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
didn't
approve
the
level
of
the
rates.
it
didn't
find
that
they're
either
the
just
reasonable
rate
or
the
appropriate
certificate
rate.
it
was
allowing
the
rates
to
be
charged.
i
think
the
commission
has
a
power
to
do
that.
it
doesn't
have
to
necessarily
give
either
the
scrutiny
required
by
section
or
by
rate
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
all
these
rates
are
involved
in
the
area
rate
proceeding
relating
to
the
texas
gulf
coast.
and
we
have
considered
them
in
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
why
we
think
that
we
do
could
order
refunds
here
down
to
the
price
determined
in
the
permanent
certificate
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
make
a
full
adjudication
of
the
rates
before
we
permit
them
to
commence
service
under
a
temporary.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
so
on
the
questions
of
need.
and
i
like
to
reiterate
that
the
commission
fully
realized
this
that
it
must
consider
not
only
whether
the
pipelines
are
getting
sufficient
quantities
of
gas
but
also
whether
there
are
more
than
sufficient
quantities
of
gas
being
purchased
and
what
effect
this
might
have
on
the
rates
of
the
pipelines
and
consequently
on
the
rates
of
the
producers
--
or
of
the
consumers.
the
–-
well,
i
see
my
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
but
basically
our
view,
however,
as
i
said
before
is
that
the
question
of
need
may
and
can,
and
is
being
considered
in
pipeline
proceedings.
the
particular
pipeline
facilities
involved
in
these
cases
have
been
approved
in
the
past.
but
normally,
in
order
to
consider
the
question
of
need
before
the
gas
goes
into
the
market
which
is
the
proper
time
to
consider
it
is
in
pipeline
proceedings.
it
cannot
be
done
in
producer
proceedings
unless
you
simply
eliminate
temporaries
because
as
was
recognized
before,
the
gas
will
be
flowing
long
before
for
a
long
time
before
the
question
of
a
need
can
be
finally
determined
in
a
producer
case.
so
in
these
circumstances,
the
appropriate
place
is
in
the
pipeline
proceedings
and
there
are
continuing
pipeline
proceedings.
they
are
always
asking
for
new
facilities
to
pick
up
more
gas,
there
are
these
budget
facilities,
we
believe
that
these
cases
provide
an
ample
opportunity
for
the
consumer
interest.
those
present
here
and
any
others
to
express
their
views
as
to
the
needs
of
the
pipelines
and
of
the
various
markets
affected.
thank
you.
