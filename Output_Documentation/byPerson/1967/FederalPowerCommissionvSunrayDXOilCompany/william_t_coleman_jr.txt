mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
the
united
gas
improvement
company
sells
gas
to
the
ultimate
consumer
in
philadelphia
and
elsewhere
in
pennsylvania.
it's
petitioner
--
it
is
a
petitioner
in
number
61
and
97.
in
each
case,
it
seeks
to
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
one,
affirm
the
commission
decision,
that
the
public
interest
and
necessity
price
for
1960
through
1962
sales
of
natural
gas
in
railroad
district
number
4
was
16
cents
per
mcf,
the
so
called
in-line
issue,
but
the
same
decision
reversed
the
commission
decision
that
it
had
the
power
to
and
should
order
refunds
in
these
proceedings.
in
other
words,
ugi
supports
the
commission's
argument
on
the
refund
issue
but
disagrees
with
its
argument
with
attempts
to
justify
the
change
from
a
15-cent
line
to
a
16-cent
line.
and
exercising
that
restraint
which
most
lawyers
can't
do,
i've
decided
to
leave
to
mr.
simons
who
is
petitioner
--
who
represents
the
petitioners
in
numbers
62
and
the
respondents
in
numbers
111,
143
and
144
to
cover
in
the
main,
the
in-line
issue
and
i
will
direct
my
argument
principally
unless
the
court
wishes
questions
on
the
other
issues
to
the
refund
issue.
with
respect
to
the
refund
issue,
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
natural
gas
act
provides
authority
for
the
commission
to
require
the
producers
to
refund
the
amounts
collected
above
the
public
interest
and
necessity
price
during
the
protracted
period
in
which
said
producers
and
consumers
were
litigating
that
question,
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
price?
the
producers
would
deny
such
power
where
the
excessive
amounts
were
collected.
while
the
sales
were
made
by
the
producers
operating
under
the
informal,
temporary,
ex
parte
letter
which
according
to
the
producers
did
not
--
in
haec
verba
specifically
say
that
they
would
have
to
refund
the
amount.
actually,
as
we
view
it,
the
issue
is
even
more
narrow.
for
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
which
we
set
forth
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
provides
that
the
commission
should
have
the
power
to
attach
to
the
issuance
of
permanent
certificates
such
reasonable
terms
and
conditions
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
require.
thus
as
we
view
it,
the
narrow
question
is,
is
there
anything
the
natural
gas
act
which
would
make
the
refund
conditions
here
imposed
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
lore?
now,
this
court's
decision
in
the
callery
case
which
interprets
the
same
language
that
i've
just
read
and
on
this
point,
the
court
was
unanimous,
held
that
the
commission
had
such
power.
and
the
fifth
circuit
just
nine
months
ago
in
continental
oil
company
read
the
statute
in
the
same
way.
and
three
years
earlier,
in
the
skelly
case,
the
d.c.
circuit
which
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
your
decision
the
callery
case
also
read
the
statute
in
the
same
way.
and
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
reached
--
which
reaches
a
different
result
interestingly
enough,
never
cites,
quotes
nor
discusses
this
statutory
language
that
i
referred
to.
now,
i
would
appreciate
it
if
the
court
would
indulge
with
me
for
just
a
moment
in
a
bit
of
history.
and
you
will
recall
that
for
the
last
five
years,
at
least
once
a
term,
you've
had
before
you
a
case
dealing
with
the
commission's
regulatory
problem
including
the
terms
and
condition
under
which
the
initial
sale
of
gas
could
be
made
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
each
case,
even
though
it's
the
pipeline
who's
the
buyer
and
therefore
should
be
the
one
in
contesting
whether
this
price
is
too
high
never
appears
before
you
but
actually
it's
the
distribution
companies,
the
new
york
commission,
the
california
commission
and
other
persons
representing
the
consumers.
now,
the
sure
reason
for
this
absent
--
absence
is
at
least
twofold.in
the
first
place,
a
lot
of
these
pipeline
companies
also
produce
natural
gas,
so
they
--
therefore
they
have
an
interest
to
say
the
price
isn't
high
as
possible.
and
secondly,
whatever
the
pipeline
pays
the
producer
for
this
gas
gets
put
in
the
cost
of
service
and
therefore
they
can
pass
it
on
to
the
local
distribution
companies
who've
been
--
would
have
to
charge
the
consumer.
now,
when
the
local
distribution
company
began
to
apply
upon
interstate
natural
gas
for
their
gas
supply
and
the
early
cases
show
that
the
pipelines
were
able
to
buy
gas
as
low
as
2
to
4
cents
per
mcf.
but
by
1956,
as
this
court
knows
from
the
catco
case,
the
unregulated
price
had
gone
up
to
approximately
23.8
cents
per
mcf.
and
therefore,
this
court
in
the
catco
case
said,
that
you
could
not
issue
a
permanent
certificate
until
after
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
price
was
the
appropriate
price.
now,
once
this
was
done,
the
ugi
along
with
the
new
york
public
service
commission
established
the
litigation
throughout
the
various
circuits
that
the
commission
had
a
responsibility
to
see
that
the
price
charge
was
no
greater
than
other
prices
which
had
been
certificated.
now,
this
approach
and
these
decisions
were
eventually
approved
by
this
court
in
the
callery
dealing
with
permanent
certificates.
these
decisions
certainly
kept
the
price
of
natural
gas
down.
but
it
also
meant
that
the
producer
could
not
introduce
a
gas
into
interstate
commerce,
commence
a
sale
until
after
there's
been
a
hearing
and
a
finding
as
to
what
was
the
appropriate
price.
and
even
though
the
commission
had
decided
that
the
appropriate
price
for
example
was
22
cents,
if
the
distributors
and
the
new
york
commission
then
took
it
to
the
court
and
got
a
reversal,
this
court
in
callery
held
that
when
you
get
around
to
making
the
final
certificate,
you
can
impose
a
refund
condition.
as
the
result
of
these
decisions,
the
battleground
between
the
consumer
and
the
producers
shifted.
the
producers
began
to
attach
to
their
application
for
permanent
certificate
or
they
would
file
it
shortly
thereafter,
a
request
for
temporary
authorization
to
commence
the
sale
of
gas
immediately
and
they
could
do
this
because
section
7
(c)
says
that
in
the
emergency
situation,
you
can
ex
parte
without
a
hearing,
without
any
evidence,
without
any
finding
get
this
temporary
relief.
now,
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
volume
1
of
the
record,
pages
78
and
79.
and
you
will
note
that
in
their
finding,
the
application
of
sunray
mid-continent
for
the
temporary
authorization.
and
as
you
read
this,
you
will
note
that
there
is
no
allegation
that
this
is
the
in-line
price.
there
is
no
request
for
a
hearing,
there
is
no
evidence
attached
to
it.
this
is
the
application.
you
will
also
note
that
the
reason
given
for
the
request
is
not
that
they
want
to
help
the
consumer,
not
that
they
want
to
help
the
pipeline
but
they
have
a
problem
peculiar
to
themselves.
namely,
that
they
had
built
a
well
right
next
to
another
well.
the
other
well
had
been
certificated
on
behalf
of
another
producer
and
if
these
people
couldn't
turn
that
gas
on,
this
first
producer
would
take
the
gas.
so
this
was
an
economic
detriment
to
the
--
to
the
sunray,
not
to
anyone
else.
you
will
note
that
that
letter
was
received
by
the
commission
on
january
23rd,
1961.
and
then
when
you
turn
to
page
80
and
81,
you
will
see
what
is
here
called
a
temporary
certificate.
it
is
merely
a
letter
from
the
commission
which
went
out
on
february
14th,
21
days.
the
consumers
never
notified,
no
hearing,
no
contest.
it
says
that
we
accept
your
request
for
temporary
authorization
but
acceptance
of
the
rates
schedule
for
temporary
service
is
no
assurance
that
it
will
be
accepted
by
the
commission
for
permanent
service.
the
commission
then
specifically
points
out
that
the
acceptance
for
filing
should
not
be
construed
as
constituting
approval
of
any
rate,
charge,
classification
or
any
rule,
regulation
or
practice
affecting
such
rate
of
service.
and
then
in
the
last
paragraph
and
if
you
indulge
me
just
to
read
this,
this
constitutes
all
requisites,
temporary
authorization
to
commence
the
sale
of
gas.
but
such
authorization
and
acceptance
of
the
rate
schedule
are
without
prejudice
to
such
final
disposition
of
certificate
application
as
the
record
may
require.
now,
there's
some
statement
that
the
producer
wasn't
on
warning
but
i
think
that
as
i
read
that
language,
it
certainly
to
the
best
of
all
human
possibility,
tried
to
tell
the
producer,
you
can
turn
this
gas
on
stream,
but
when
we
finally
get
around
to
the
hearing,
this
--
you
may
well
be
affected.
and
to
answer
--
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
feel
that
if
the
certificate
had
said
that
the
commission
denied
that
it
had
the
authority
on
permanent
certification
to
order
the
refund,
that
that
would
have
been
contrary
to
your
decision
in
catco
and
that
decision
certainly
if
we
gotten
to
the
d.c.
circuit
would
have
been
reversed.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
they
were
--
they
were
not
more
than
the
guideline
price,
your
honor,
that
that's
true
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
if
you
mean
by
set,
that
the
commission
had
issued
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
suggested
them,
and
that
--
those
guideline
prices
are
reproduced
in
the
sunray
brief
in
the
appendix
in
7
(a).
i
wish
you
would
read
about
seven
lines
from
the
bottom
which
says
that
this
is
well
affecting
the
substantive
right
of
any
party.
now,
if
you're
going
to
hold
that
somehow
that
guideline
price
changes
what
would
otherwise
be
the
consumer's
right,
you,
by
definition
saying
that
it
affects
our
substantive
right.
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
suggested
price
and
what
the
administrative,
the
commission
was
saying
is
as
far
as
the
commission
was
concerned,
if
you
did
at
this
price,
we
will
issue
the
temporary
letter.
but
it
was
also
clear
that
the
consumer
who
weren't
permitted
to
intervene
would
attack
that
price
which
we
did
and
by
a
trial
before
the
commission,
we
demonstrated
that
the
18
cent
was
too
high
and
it
should
not
be
more
than
16-cents
and
in
fact
we
argue
it
should
not
be
more
than
15.
and
when
we
really
get
around
the
litigation,
it
was
determined
that
the
consumer
was
right
and
therefore,
if
you
hold
that
merely
because
the
commission
mentioned
certain
figures,
that
that
affects
our
right,
and
i
think
you're
doing
contrary
to
what
the
public
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
commission
would
not
have
such
power
and
that
type
of
certificate
would
have
been
reversed
by
the
court.
that's
--
that's
our
position.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
right
now,
your
honors,
if
you
will
give
about
a
minute
and
half
to
answer
it,
because
i
have
to
give
you
a
better
history,
that
contrary
to
what
the
producers
say,
the
producers
claim
that
from
1956
until
the
d.c.
circuit
reversed
in
the
skelly
oil
case
that
there
was
announced
commission,
a
policy
that
they
would
not
impose
such
refunds.
now,
the
only
case
that
they
cite
and
this
is
on
page
50
of
sunray's
brief,
in
the
signal
oil
case
which
went
up
to
the
third
circuit.
now,
despite
the
fact
in
their
brief
they
claim
that
the
third
circuit
had
made
the
decision
that
they
could
not
order
the
refund.
i
read
that
opinion
five
times,
there
is
no
such
a
language
in
the
case
that
all
the
--
that
case
dealt
with
whether
if
you
issue
the
temporary
certificate
at
there
at
12
cents,
and
then
when
you
got
around
to
the
permanent
hearing,
you
reduced
it
to
10
cents,
could
you
do
that
without
having
a
just
and
reasonable
finding?
the
commission
said
you
could.
the
third
circuit
said
you
could.
and
the
producer
somehow,
because
the
commission
didn't
also
say
in
refund
in
the
2
cents
difference,
that
nobody
asked
them
to
do,
the
consumers
weren't
involved
in
that
case,
the
point
wasn't
litigated,
they
say
that
that
is
the
decision
which
demonstrates
that
this
was
an
announcement
of
commission
policy.
now,
certainly,
the
absence
of
one
swallow
to
change
the
metaphor
doesn't
make
a
winner.
and
the
fact
is
that
in
january
1962,
in
the
catco
case
on
remand,
and
we
reproduce
this
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
the
commission
specifically
holds
that
in
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
with
didn't
have
the
refund
provision
that
you
still
could
order
the
refunds.
so
in
1962,
you
have
this
--
you
have
the
signal
oil
case
where
the
issue
was
not
argued.
it
was
not
passed
upon,
there
was
no
such
decision,
no
language,
then
you
have
the
catco
on
remand.
the
next
case
is
the
skelly
oil
case.
we,
the
consumer
interest
urged
in
skelly
oil
that
even
though
the
words
weren't
in
the
temporary,
you
still
could
impose
a
condition.
the
commission
in
august
1962
decided
the
case
against
us.
we
then
took
the
only
relief
we
can
do
other
than
go
to
the
corner
bar
where
you
lose
the
case,
we
took
an
appeal.
and
that
appeal
was
pending
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
then
as
cautious
lawyers,
because
the
commission
has
said
that
we
had
no
authority
to
do
this,
or
at
least
we
shouldn't
do
it,
unless
the
condition
is
in
there,
we
then
asked
the
condition
to
do
it.
and
the
commission
said
that
they
were
not
in
the
midst
of
a
hearing
before
the
evidence
was
in,
it
was
not
going
to
put
in
the
condition.
we
then
won
the
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit
which
says
that
from
the
beginning,
even
without
imposing
such
a
condition,
we
had
this
power.
now,
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
it's
kind
of
difficult
to
say
that
the
consumer
now
should
be
estopped
from
claiming
that
the
commission
does
have
the
authority
and
they
should
exercise
the
power.
i
would
next
like
--
and
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
language
that
i
read
is
as
clear
a
warning
as
people
could
give
that
there
was
no
finality
to
this
right.
and
i
certainly
would
say
as
a
lawyer,
i
would
advise
my
client
that
there
was
more
finality
to
the
callery
property.
the
final
decision
of
the
commission
which
held
what
the
rights
should
be,
nobody
asked
for
a
stay
and
that
was
the
rate
--
it
was
a
final
order
subject
only
to
appeal
and
this
court
had
no
problem
there
saying
that
if
it
turned
out
you
were
wrong,
you
could
impose
the
condition.
i
would
next
like
to
turn
to
another
point
in
the
case
which
is
a
--
which
arises
from
the
fact
that
before
the
commission,
this
case
was
decided
in
two
parts.
in
opinion
422,
the
commission
held
that
they
had
the
power
but
left
to
a
later
hearing
whether
there
were
any
--
there
was
any
reason
why
as
a
matter
of
equity,
the
power
should
not
be
exercised.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit
decided
that
there
was
no
power.
thereafter,
the
commission
decided
that
on
the
equities,
the
consumers
were
entitled
to
the
refund.
when
that
case
was
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“well,
we
already
said
you
had
no
power,
so
we
never
get
to
the
equity
question”.
now,
both
points
were
then
brought
to
this
court
and
i'd
like
to
urge
that
this
commission
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
commission
in
its
entirety
rather
than
holding
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
incorrect
as
a
whole,
on
the
question
of
power,
and
then
sending
it
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
to
pass
on
the
equity
questions.
now,
the
reasons
for
asking
for
this
is
in
one,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
precedents
of
this
court
where
you've
done
it,
or
you've
done
just
this.
particularly,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
power
commission
because
by
time
these
cases
get
to
you
the
first
time,
there's
such
a
long
time
and
these
contracts
are
only
20-year
contract
and
seven
years
have
gone
by
already.
so
we
do
think
that
you
ought
to
decide
it
now.
you
do
have
the
full
case
here.
and
as
i
said,
one
third
of
the
time
is
already
gone
by.
now,
the
only
reason
why
the
commission
--
the
producers
and
on
this
point,
what
the
commission
said
that
we
will
accept
all
of
your
factual
allegations
in
your
brief
and
whatever
you
claim
on
the
facts,
we
will
decide
the
issue
on
that
basis.
so
the
producers
can't
complain
that
they
could
put
in
more
evidence
because
they
said,
“well,
whatever
you
said
and
represented
in
your
brief,
we
will
decide
on
that
basis”.
but
their
first
reason
is
that
they
relied
upon
the
absence
of
the
expressed
provision.
i'd
like
to
recall
your
attention
again,
the
catco
on
remand
case
were
held
that
they
did
have
the
authorities,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
they
ought
not
to
be
relying
upon
that.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
temporary
authorization
did
contain
such
a
warning
and
thirdly,
that
the
producers
had
executed
these
contracts
before
they
received
any
type
of
authorization.
so
if
you
execute
a
contract
in
1960,
you
then
file
it
and
you
apply
for
temporary
authority
in
1961.
i
failed
to
see
how
and
what
you
did
in
1961
can
affect
the
situation.
the
second
reason
they
gave
was
that
--
that
during
the
time
when
they
thought
that
they
would
not
have
to
make
these
refunds
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
couldn't
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
also,
they
were
made
under
temporary
authorization
which
represented
that
if
you
don't
give
it
to
us,
we're
going
to
lose
our
gas.
it's
going
to
be
flared.
it's
going
to
be
drained.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
business
decision
was
between
whether
for
the
next
seven
years,
they
were
going
to
get
zero
or
were
they're
going
to
get
16
or
18
cents
because
that's
the
allegation
on
which
the
commission
issued
the
temporary
authorization.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
--
i
answer
that
question
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
the
order
of
february
5th,
1963.
and
that
was
done
after
we
had
lost
skelly
before
the
commission
but
taken
an
appeal
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
then
out
of
fondness
of
cautions,
the
lawyers
say,
“well,
if
we're
wrong
there
we're
going
to
try
to
at
least
cut
down
on
losses.
why
don't
you
do
it
now?”
the
commission
said
they
would
not
do
it
in
the
interim
because
they
were
still
holding
the
hearing,
but
then
we
won
the
first
case
which
said
that
ab
initio
we
had
the
power
even
though
there
was
not
such
condition.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
because
i
just
don't
think
that
by
reading
the
temporary
authorization
language,
reading
catco
on
remand,
reading
the
general
history
here
that
the
producer
could
reasonably
say
that
he
could
keep
this
money.
now,
the
one
reason
they
gave
which
appealed
to
the
commission
was
that
--
that
while
they
were
collecting
the
higher
amount,
they
were
paying
royalties
and
taxes
to
the
--
royalties
to
the
owner
and
taxes
to
the
state
of
texas
and
since
they
paid
it
not
under
protest,
they
may
not
be
able
to
get
it
back.
so
the
commission
took
care
of
that
saying,
during
the
interim
before
--
from
the
time
you
started
until
skelly
was
decided,
we
will
let
you
deduct
the
taxes.
the
third
reason
they
gave
and
only
two
of
them
gave
this
reason,
namely
humble
and
texas
oil
was
that
by
collecting
these
amounts,
thinking
that
they
were
not
subject
to
refund,
that
they
took
budgetary
positions
and
financing
which
they
otherwise
would
not
have
done.
and
the
commission
there
found
that
involved
with
humble
oil
was
only
$1500
of
refund
and
involved
with
texas
was
only
$25,000
and
since
that
these
are
both
multimillion,
if
not
billion
dollar
corporation,
it
would
beyond
comprehension
that
that
amount
of
money
could
really
affect
their
planning.
the
other
reason
given
was
that
there
was
no
proof
to
these
refunds
would
go
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
the
commission
has
followed
the
policy
there
of
saying
that
we
will
direct
this
money
as
far
down
the
chain
as
we
under
our
power
can
do.
also,
the
new
york
commission
and
the
other
commissions
have
been
very
active
in
seeing
that
this
money
did
go
to
the
ultimate
consumers.
now,
the
fifth
and
last
reason
was
that
you
should
wait
until
the
just
and
reasonable
hearing
before
you
order
the
refund.
now,
if
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
callery
case
had
prevailed,
perhaps
that
would
make
some
sense.
but
once
this
court
in
callery
said
that
you
measure
it
by
the
in-line
price
rather
than
by
the
just
and
reasonable
price
and
i
think
that
reason
goes
by
the
board.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
on
my
argument,
the
basic
issue
here
is
having
one
catco,
having
finally
decided
the
proposition
that
gas
could
not
go
into
interstate
commerce
at
any
price
higher
than
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
price,
does
the
consumer
now
lose
the
ball
--
lose
the
ballgame
by
saying
that
when
you
are
able
to
block
the
producer,
because
they
couldn't
get
a
permanent
certificate
which
required
a
hearing
that
he
can
get
a
greater
rate
by
coming
back
the
next
day,
asking
for
temporary
relief
under
a
letter,
which
letter
the
consumers
never
got
served
with
--
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
there
was
no
hearing,
and
that
that
letter
agreement
has
greater
validity,
more
power
and
more
significance
than
the
permanent
certificate
would
have
had
without
a
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
guideline
prices
ought
to
have
no
effect
whatsoever
your
honor
because
they
were
issued
without
a
contest
and
they
were
strictly
the
suggestion
of
the
commission
as
to
how
it
would
act
internally
pending
the
resolution
of
the
area
rate
case,
pending
the
resolution
of
the
in-line
cases.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
should
not
be
hurt
your
honor
and
i
assure
you
they
won't
be
hurt
--
more
hurt
than
that
of
the
consumer
who
has
litigated,
has
had
a
finding
that
he
is
right,
and
then
finds
out
because
it
took
him
seven
years
to
get
here,
that
that
the
producer
by
a
letter
which
nobody
contested
gets
rights
that
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
if
he'd
asked
for
a
permanent
certificate,
if
the
commission
had
wrongly
issued
the
permanent
certificate
and
would
gotten
here
by
way
of
the
callery
rule.
and
i
would
like
your
honor
or
this
--
i
think
it's
the
brief
for
respondents
sunray
dx,
it's
the
green
one,
on
7
(a)
when
the
commission
made
these
announcements.
and
it
says,
“these
price
levels
as
announced
by
appendix
a
attached
to
this
statement
are
for
the
purpose
of
guidance
and
initial
action
by
the
commission
and
they're
used
to
not
deprived
any
party
of
substantive
rights
or
fix”,
repeat
“or
fix
the
ultimate
justness
and
reasonableness
of
any
rate
level”.
and
actually,
i
think
the
producers
attempted
to
take
the
guidelines
to
court
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
appealable
order
because
it
was
just
a
policy
announcement.
it's
just
as
though
a
commission
may
say,
“well,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
if
you
do
a,
b
and
c,
we
will
not
do
anything.
but
if
some
litigant
comes
in
and
he
makes
a
protest,
we
will
then
hear
it.”
we
did
come
in,
we
made
the
protest
we
want.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor
for
this
reason,
after
these
cases
got
into
the
commission
and
the
consumer's
custody
said,
“well,
certainly
you
can't
continue
to
issue
these
ex
parte
orders
because
we
don't
know
about
them
and
if
these
are
going
affect
our
rights,
we
should
know
about
them”.
by
this
time,
we
had
lost
skelly
so
we
thought
--
we
thought
we
were
right,
but
we
had
to
go
the
court
to
have
our
rights
vindicated
if
we
did.
the
commission
then
for
the
first
time
began
to
take
the
letter
and
put
it
in
the
public
reference
office.
and
the
new
york
commission
by
great
diligence,
by
going
there
everyday,
going
through
every
document,
finally
found
one
which
is
the
j.
ray
mcdermott
which
had
been
issued.
the
commission
then
appealed
that
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
commission
could
not
be
reversed
because
the
order
was
tentative
and
when
you
get
around
to
the
hearing
on
the
permanent
certificate
at
that
point,
the
commission
could
order
that
the
difference
between
the
price
charge
in
the
temporary
and
the
actual
public
convenience
and
necessity
price
should
be
charged.
so,
the
d.c.
circuit
which
is
the
only
circuit
that
has
really
looked
at
all
aspects
of
this
problem
had
made
it
clear
that
that
--
you're
in
a
dilemma
here,
that
if
you
hold
that
the
temporary
certificate
has
this
great
substantive
effect
that
the
producers
would
have,
then
you
certainly
have
to
give
the
consumer
an
opportunity
to
contest
it.
now,
if
you're
going
to
contest
it
before
the
commission,
you
have
to
have
the
same
hearing
that
you
--
that
you
said
you
had
to
have
in
catco.
now,
if
you
had
that
hearing,
it's
going
to
take
you
a
year
or
two
to
get
it
resolved.
now,
if
the
producer
in
the
meantime
is
losing
its
gas
to
the
drainage
or
flaring,
he
can't
afford
to
wait
two
years.
so
the
only
alternative
is
to
issue
an
ex
parte,
to
issue
it
without
a
hearing,
without
a
contest
and
then
when
the
parties
have
the
contest,
determine
that
you
have
to
refund
the
difference
between
what
you
were
charging
and
what
is
determined
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
price.
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did.
mcdermott
and
skelly
oil
and
we
submit
that
that's
the
appropriate
way
that
this
matter
should
be
handled.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
have
been
selling
it
--
because
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
stay
--
they
would
be
selling
it
at
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
the
16
cents.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
i
--
pardon
me.
the
stays
had
been
granted
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
so
they
still
are
selling
it
at
the
18
cents.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
could
have
been
doing
that,
your
honor.
you
can
only
fix
an
in-line
price
after
you
had
a
litigated
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
issue
this
here
before
you
now.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
a
direct
appeal,
we
tell
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
we
hope
we
do
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
on
that
point.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
where
they
were
charging
18
cents
under
a
letter,
at
which
we
couldn't
contest
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
we
by
contesting
could
convince
even
the
taft
commission
that
it
should
be
16
cents,
that
we
ought
to
get
the
2
cents
back.
now,
if
we
are
successful
in
this
court,
it
rolls
back
to
15
cents
and
i
think
if
callery
means
anything,
it
means
that
we
get
that
one
penny
back,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
after
a
full
hearing
and
a
trial,
you
--
you
get
the
one
cent
back
under
the
permanent
certificate,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
follows
as
night
as
the
day
although
in
the
law,
a
lot
of
times,
you
can't
be
this
confident
that
you
have
to
give
us
back
the
three
cents
and
that's
what
we
submit
is
the
issue
here.
and
therefore
we
urge
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
well,
it's
not
--
it's
the
public
convenience
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
and
necessity
pricing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
also
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
a
reason
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
a
reasonable
condition
under
section
7
(a)
in
a
permanent
certificate
that
where
a
producer
interjects
gas
in
interstate
commerce
before
he
gets
a
final
certificate
and
he
does
it
under
representation
that
if
you
don't
let
me
do
it,
i'm
going
to
lose
my
gas
forever,
that
is
a
reasonable
condition
for
the
commission
to
say
that
now
that
we've
determined,
you
should
have
been
charging
only
16
cents
if
they're
right,
or
15
cents
if
we're
right,
you
also
have
to
pay
back
the
additional
two
or
three
cents
depending
upon
what
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
if
we
win,
no
further
hearings
would
be
necessary.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
already
been
--
well,
it's
been
--
it's
been
computed
in
the
sense
that
that
--
that
anyone
who
can
read
can
make
the
computation
and
then
i
think
i
under
the
order
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
three
cents,
and
under
the
order
you
could
--
you
have
to
know
how
many
volumes
they
sold.
the
order
says
within
30
days,
they
have
to
come
in
and
file
what
the
figure
is
and
then
they
file
it
and
then
they
pay
it
back.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
thought
that
the
second
half
of
my
argument
was
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
determine
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
up
here
and
that
if
you
send
it
back
--
just
look
at
the
dates,
these
contracts
executed
1960-62.
they
had
got
the
temporary
authorization
in
1961.
the
commission
422
i
think
is
1964,
by
the
time
they
get
around
to
501,
you're
in
1966,
you
then
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
1968
now,
and
these
contracts
are
only
20-year
contracts
your
honor,
at
some
point,
i
think
the
court
ought
to
decide
it
and
decide
it
finally
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
and
not
send
it
back.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
oh
yes.
i
--
well,
only
--
what
callery
says,
your
honor,
that
to
--
if
the
producers
have
been
unjustly
enriched
that
the
remedy
is
that
the
commission
also
impose
interest
and
i
think
that
right
now
is
7%.
and
therefore
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
hard
to
tell
you,
your
honor,
because
our
company
is
really
divided
into
two
parts
in
the
sense
that
we
operate
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
philadelphia
gasworks.
we
also
own
as
a
normal
public
utility
upstate
companies.
i
would
say,
if
you
don't
hold
me
to
the
figure,
it's
about
a
$150,000
or
$200,000.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
it?
that
which
goes
the
upstate
companies,
would
go
back
to
the
consumers
by
way
of
a
rate
reduction.
that
which
comes
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
because
the
city
of
philadelphia
has
an
operating
agreement
with
the
ugi
which
says
that
for
$800,000
regardless
of
the
profit
is,
that's
all
the
ugi
gas.
any
excess
goes
into
the
city
treasurer
and
that
there
are
two
or
three
cases
in
the
seventh
or
eighth
circuit
which
i
think
in
the
natural
gas
case
which
is
the
whole
--
and
as
a
matter
of
law
that
when
you
can
demonstrate,
the
money
goes
back
into
the
general
public
treasure,
that's
the
same
as
if
you
paid
it
to
the
consumer.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
not
only
that,
but
it
helps
us
to
begin
to
solve
some
of
the
tremendous
problems
of
the
urban
community,
so
we'd
very
much
liked
it
to
go
back.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
the
united
gas
improvement
company
sells
gas
to
the
ultimate
consumer
in
philadelphia
and
elsewhere
in
pennsylvania.
it's
petitioner
--
it
is
a
petitioner
in
number
61
and
97.
in
each
case,
it
seeks
to
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
one,
affirm
the
commission
decision,
that
the
public
interest
and
necessity
price
for
1960
through
1962
sales
of
natural
gas
in
railroad
district
number
4
was
16
cents
per
mcf,
the
so
called
in-line
issue,
but
the
same
decision
reversed
the
commission
decision
that
it
had
the
power
to
and
should
order
refunds
in
these
proceedings.
in
other
words,
ugi
supports
the
commission's
argument
on
the
refund
issue
but
disagrees
with
its
argument
with
attempts
to
justify
the
change
from
a
15-cent
line
to
a
16-cent
line.
and
exercising
that
restraint
which
most
lawyers
can't
do,
i've
decided
to
leave
to
mr.
simons
who
is
petitioner
--
who
represents
the
petitioners
in
numbers
62
and
the
respondents
in
numbers
111,
143
and
144
to
cover
in
the
main,
the
in-line
issue
and
i
will
direct
my
argument
principally
unless
the
court
wishes
questions
on
the
other
issues
to
the
refund
issue.
with
respect
to
the
refund
issue,
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
natural
gas
act
provides
authority
for
the
commission
to
require
the
producers
to
refund
the
amounts
collected
above
the
public
interest
and
necessity
price
during
the
protracted
period
in
which
said
producers
and
consumers
were
litigating
that
question,
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
price?
the
producers
would
deny
such
power
where
the
excessive
amounts
were
collected.
while
the
sales
were
made
by
the
producers
operating
under
the
informal,
temporary,
ex
parte
letter
which
according
to
the
producers
did
not
--
in
haec
verba
specifically
say
that
they
would
have
to
refund
the
amount.
actually,
as
we
view
it,
the
issue
is
even
more
narrow.
for
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
which
we
set
forth
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
provides
that
the
commission
should
have
the
power
to
attach
to
the
issuance
of
permanent
certificates
such
reasonable
terms
and
conditions
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
require.
thus
as
we
view
it,
the
narrow
question
is,
is
there
anything
the
natural
gas
act
which
would
make
the
refund
conditions
here
imposed
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
lore?
now,
this
court's
decision
in
the
callery
case
which
interprets
the
same
language
that
i've
just
read
and
on
this
point,
the
court
was
unanimous,
held
that
the
commission
had
such
power.
and
the
fifth
circuit
just
nine
months
ago
in
continental
oil
company
read
the
statute
in
the
same
way.
and
three
years
earlier,
in
the
skelly
case,
the
d.c.
circuit
which
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
your
decision
the
callery
case
also
read
the
statute
in
the
same
way.
and
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
reached
--
which
reaches
a
different
result
interestingly
enough,
never
cites,
quotes
nor
discusses
this
statutory
language
that
i
referred
to.
now,
i
would
appreciate
it
if
the
court
would
indulge
with
me
for
just
a
moment
in
a
bit
of
history.
and
you
will
recall
that
for
the
last
five
years,
at
least
once
a
term,
you've
had
before
you
a
case
dealing
with
the
commission's
regulatory
problem
including
the
terms
and
condition
under
which
the
initial
sale
of
gas
could
be
made
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
each
case,
even
though
it's
the
pipeline
who's
the
buyer
and
therefore
should
be
the
one
in
contesting
whether
this
price
is
too
high
never
appears
before
you
but
actually
it's
the
distribution
companies,
the
new
york
commission,
the
california
commission
and
other
persons
representing
the
consumers.
now,
the
sure
reason
for
this
absent
--
absence
is
at
least
twofold.in
the
first
place,
a
lot
of
these
pipeline
companies
also
produce
natural
gas,
so
they
--
therefore
they
have
an
interest
to
say
the
price
isn't
high
as
possible.
and
secondly,
whatever
the
pipeline
pays
the
producer
for
this
gas
gets
put
in
the
cost
of
service
and
therefore
they
can
pass
it
on
to
the
local
distribution
companies
who've
been
--
would
have
to
charge
the
consumer.
now,
when
the
local
distribution
company
began
to
apply
upon
interstate
natural
gas
for
their
gas
supply
and
the
early
cases
show
that
the
pipelines
were
able
to
buy
gas
as
low
as
2
to
4
cents
per
mcf.
but
by
1956,
as
this
court
knows
from
the
catco
case,
the
unregulated
price
had
gone
up
to
approximately
23.8
cents
per
mcf.
and
therefore,
this
court
in
the
catco
case
said,
that
you
could
not
issue
a
permanent
certificate
until
after
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
price
was
the
appropriate
price.
now,
once
this
was
done,
the
ugi
along
with
the
new
york
public
service
commission
established
the
litigation
throughout
the
various
circuits
that
the
commission
had
a
responsibility
to
see
that
the
price
charge
was
no
greater
than
other
prices
which
had
been
certificated.
now,
this
approach
and
these
decisions
were
eventually
approved
by
this
court
in
the
callery
dealing
with
permanent
certificates.
these
decisions
certainly
kept
the
price
of
natural
gas
down.
but
it
also
meant
that
the
producer
could
not
introduce
a
gas
into
interstate
commerce,
commence
a
sale
until
after
there's
been
a
hearing
and
a
finding
as
to
what
was
the
appropriate
price.
and
even
though
the
commission
had
decided
that
the
appropriate
price
for
example
was
22
cents,
if
the
distributors
and
the
new
york
commission
then
took
it
to
the
court
and
got
a
reversal,
this
court
in
callery
held
that
when
you
get
around
to
making
the
final
certificate,
you
can
impose
a
refund
condition.
as
the
result
of
these
decisions,
the
battleground
between
the
consumer
and
the
producers
shifted.
the
producers
began
to
attach
to
their
application
for
permanent
certificate
or
they
would
file
it
shortly
thereafter,
a
request
for
temporary
authorization
to
commence
the
sale
of
gas
immediately
and
they
could
do
this
because
section
7
(c)
says
that
in
the
emergency
situation,
you
can
ex
parte
without
a
hearing,
without
any
evidence,
without
any
finding
get
this
temporary
relief.
now,
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
volume
1
of
the
record,
pages
78
and
79.
and
you
will
note
that
in
their
finding,
the
application
of
sunray
mid-continent
for
the
temporary
authorization.
and
as
you
read
this,
you
will
note
that
there
is
no
allegation
that
this
is
the
in-line
price.
there
is
no
request
for
a
hearing,
there
is
no
evidence
attached
to
it.
this
is
the
application.
you
will
also
note
that
the
reason
given
for
the
request
is
not
that
they
want
to
help
the
consumer,
not
that
they
want
to
help
the
pipeline
but
they
have
a
problem
peculiar
to
themselves.
namely,
that
they
had
built
a
well
right
next
to
another
well.
the
other
well
had
been
certificated
on
behalf
of
another
producer
and
if
these
people
couldn't
turn
that
gas
on,
this
first
producer
would
take
the
gas.
so
this
was
an
economic
detriment
to
the
--
to
the
sunray,
not
to
anyone
else.
you
will
note
that
that
letter
was
received
by
the
commission
on
january
23rd,
1961.
and
then
when
you
turn
to
page
80
and
81,
you
will
see
what
is
here
called
a
temporary
certificate.
it
is
merely
a
letter
from
the
commission
which
went
out
on
february
14th,
21
days.
the
consumers
never
notified,
no
hearing,
no
contest.
it
says
that
we
accept
your
request
for
temporary
authorization
but
acceptance
of
the
rates
schedule
for
temporary
service
is
no
assurance
that
it
will
be
accepted
by
the
commission
for
permanent
service.
the
commission
then
specifically
points
out
that
the
acceptance
for
filing
should
not
be
construed
as
constituting
approval
of
any
rate,
charge,
classification
or
any
rule,
regulation
or
practice
affecting
such
rate
of
service.
and
then
in
the
last
paragraph
and
if
you
indulge
me
just
to
read
this,
this
constitutes
all
requisites,
temporary
authorization
to
commence
the
sale
of
gas.
but
such
authorization
and
acceptance
of
the
rate
schedule
are
without
prejudice
to
such
final
disposition
of
certificate
application
as
the
record
may
require.
now,
there's
some
statement
that
the
producer
wasn't
on
warning
but
i
think
that
as
i
read
that
language,
it
certainly
to
the
best
of
all
human
possibility,
tried
to
tell
the
producer,
you
can
turn
this
gas
on
stream,
but
when
we
finally
get
around
to
the
hearing,
this
--
you
may
well
be
affected.
and
to
answer
--
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
feel
that
if
the
certificate
had
said
that
the
commission
denied
that
it
had
the
authority
on
permanent
certification
to
order
the
refund,
that
that
would
have
been
contrary
to
your
decision
in
catco
and
that
decision
certainly
if
we
gotten
to
the
d.c.
circuit
would
have
been
reversed.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
they
were
--
they
were
not
more
than
the
guideline
price,
your
honor,
that
that's
true
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
if
you
mean
by
set,
that
the
commission
had
issued
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
suggested
them,
and
that
--
those
guideline
prices
are
reproduced
in
the
sunray
brief
in
the
appendix
in
7
(a).
i
wish
you
would
read
about
seven
lines
from
the
bottom
which
says
that
this
is
well
affecting
the
substantive
right
of
any
party.
now,
if
you're
going
to
hold
that
somehow
that
guideline
price
changes
what
would
otherwise
be
the
consumer's
right,
you,
by
definition
saying
that
it
affects
our
substantive
right.
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
suggested
price
and
what
the
administrative,
the
commission
was
saying
is
as
far
as
the
commission
was
concerned,
if
you
did
at
this
price,
we
will
issue
the
temporary
letter.
but
it
was
also
clear
that
the
consumer
who
weren't
permitted
to
intervene
would
attack
that
price
which
we
did
and
by
a
trial
before
the
commission,
we
demonstrated
that
the
18
cent
was
too
high
and
it
should
not
be
more
than
16-cents
and
in
fact
we
argue
it
should
not
be
more
than
15.
and
when
we
really
get
around
the
litigation,
it
was
determined
that
the
consumer
was
right
and
therefore,
if
you
hold
that
merely
because
the
commission
mentioned
certain
figures,
that
that
affects
our
right,
and
i
think
you're
doing
contrary
to
what
the
public
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
commission
would
not
have
such
power
and
that
type
of
certificate
would
have
been
reversed
by
the
court.
that's
--
that's
our
position.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
right
now,
your
honors,
if
you
will
give
about
a
minute
and
half
to
answer
it,
because
i
have
to
give
you
a
better
history,
that
contrary
to
what
the
producers
say,
the
producers
claim
that
from
1956
until
the
d.c.
circuit
reversed
in
the
skelly
oil
case
that
there
was
announced
commission,
a
policy
that
they
would
not
impose
such
refunds.
now,
the
only
case
that
they
cite
and
this
is
on
page
50
of
sunray's
brief,
in
the
signal
oil
case
which
went
up
to
the
third
circuit.
now,
despite
the
fact
in
their
brief
they
claim
that
the
third
circuit
had
made
the
decision
that
they
could
not
order
the
refund.
i
read
that
opinion
five
times,
there
is
no
such
a
language
in
the
case
that
all
the
--
that
case
dealt
with
whether
if
you
issue
the
temporary
certificate
at
there
at
12
cents,
and
then
when
you
got
around
to
the
permanent
hearing,
you
reduced
it
to
10
cents,
could
you
do
that
without
having
a
just
and
reasonable
finding?
the
commission
said
you
could.
the
third
circuit
said
you
could.
and
the
producer
somehow,
because
the
commission
didn't
also
say
in
refund
in
the
2
cents
difference,
that
nobody
asked
them
to
do,
the
consumers
weren't
involved
in
that
case,
the
point
wasn't
litigated,
they
say
that
that
is
the
decision
which
demonstrates
that
this
was
an
announcement
of
commission
policy.
now,
certainly,
the
absence
of
one
swallow
to
change
the
metaphor
doesn't
make
a
winner.
and
the
fact
is
that
in
january
1962,
in
the
catco
case
on
remand,
and
we
reproduce
this
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
the
commission
specifically
holds
that
in
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
with
didn't
have
the
refund
provision
that
you
still
could
order
the
refunds.
so
in
1962,
you
have
this
--
you
have
the
signal
oil
case
where
the
issue
was
not
argued.
it
was
not
passed
upon,
there
was
no
such
decision,
no
language,
then
you
have
the
catco
on
remand.
the
next
case
is
the
skelly
oil
case.
we,
the
consumer
interest
urged
in
skelly
oil
that
even
though
the
words
weren't
in
the
temporary,
you
still
could
impose
a
condition.
the
commission
in
august
1962
decided
the
case
against
us.
we
then
took
the
only
relief
we
can
do
other
than
go
to
the
corner
bar
where
you
lose
the
case,
we
took
an
appeal.
and
that
appeal
was
pending
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
then
as
cautious
lawyers,
because
the
commission
has
said
that
we
had
no
authority
to
do
this,
or
at
least
we
shouldn't
do
it,
unless
the
condition
is
in
there,
we
then
asked
the
condition
to
do
it.
and
the
commission
said
that
they
were
not
in
the
midst
of
a
hearing
before
the
evidence
was
in,
it
was
not
going
to
put
in
the
condition.
we
then
won
the
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit
which
says
that
from
the
beginning,
even
without
imposing
such
a
condition,
we
had
this
power.
now,
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
it's
kind
of
difficult
to
say
that
the
consumer
now
should
be
estopped
from
claiming
that
the
commission
does
have
the
authority
and
they
should
exercise
the
power.
i
would
next
like
--
and
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
language
that
i
read
is
as
clear
a
warning
as
people
could
give
that
there
was
no
finality
to
this
right.
and
i
certainly
would
say
as
a
lawyer,
i
would
advise
my
client
that
there
was
more
finality
to
the
callery
property.
the
final
decision
of
the
commission
which
held
what
the
rights
should
be,
nobody
asked
for
a
stay
and
that
was
the
rate
--
it
was
a
final
order
subject
only
to
appeal
and
this
court
had
no
problem
there
saying
that
if
it
turned
out
you
were
wrong,
you
could
impose
the
condition.
i
would
next
like
to
turn
to
another
point
in
the
case
which
is
a
--
which
arises
from
the
fact
that
before
the
commission,
this
case
was
decided
in
two
parts.
in
opinion
422,
the
commission
held
that
they
had
the
power
but
left
to
a
later
hearing
whether
there
were
any
--
there
was
any
reason
why
as
a
matter
of
equity,
the
power
should
not
be
exercised.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit
decided
that
there
was
no
power.
thereafter,
the
commission
decided
that
on
the
equities,
the
consumers
were
entitled
to
the
refund.
when
that
case
was
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“well,
we
already
said
you
had
no
power,
so
we
never
get
to
the
equity
question”.
now,
both
points
were
then
brought
to
this
court
and
i'd
like
to
urge
that
this
commission
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
commission
in
its
entirety
rather
than
holding
that
the
tenth
circuit
was
incorrect
as
a
whole,
on
the
question
of
power,
and
then
sending
it
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
to
pass
on
the
equity
questions.
now,
the
reasons
for
asking
for
this
is
in
one,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
precedents
of
this
court
where
you've
done
it,
or
you've
done
just
this.
particularly,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
power
commission
because
by
time
these
cases
get
to
you
the
first
time,
there's
such
a
long
time
and
these
contracts
are
only
20-year
contract
and
seven
years
have
gone
by
already.
so
we
do
think
that
you
ought
to
decide
it
now.
you
do
have
the
full
case
here.
and
as
i
said,
one
third
of
the
time
is
already
gone
by.
now,
the
only
reason
why
the
commission
--
the
producers
and
on
this
point,
what
the
commission
said
that
we
will
accept
all
of
your
factual
allegations
in
your
brief
and
whatever
you
claim
on
the
facts,
we
will
decide
the
issue
on
that
basis.
so
the
producers
can't
complain
that
they
could
put
in
more
evidence
because
they
said,
“well,
whatever
you
said
and
represented
in
your
brief,
we
will
decide
on
that
basis”.
but
their
first
reason
is
that
they
relied
upon
the
absence
of
the
expressed
provision.
i'd
like
to
recall
your
attention
again,
the
catco
on
remand
case
were
held
that
they
did
have
the
authorities,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
they
ought
not
to
be
relying
upon
that.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
temporary
authorization
did
contain
such
a
warning
and
thirdly,
that
the
producers
had
executed
these
contracts
before
they
received
any
type
of
authorization.
so
if
you
execute
a
contract
in
1960,
you
then
file
it
and
you
apply
for
temporary
authority
in
1961.
i
failed
to
see
how
and
what
you
did
in
1961
can
affect
the
situation.
the
second
reason
they
gave
was
that
--
that
during
the
time
when
they
thought
that
they
would
not
have
to
make
these
refunds
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
couldn't
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
also,
they
were
made
under
temporary
authorization
which
represented
that
if
you
don't
give
it
to
us,
we're
going
to
lose
our
gas.
it's
going
to
be
flared.
it's
going
to
be
drained.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
business
decision
was
between
whether
for
the
next
seven
years,
they
were
going
to
get
zero
or
were
they're
going
to
get
16
or
18
cents
because
that's
the
allegation
on
which
the
commission
issued
the
temporary
authorization.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
--
i
answer
that
question
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
the
order
of
february
5th,
1963.
and
that
was
done
after
we
had
lost
skelly
before
the
commission
but
taken
an
appeal
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
then
out
of
fondness
of
cautions,
the
lawyers
say,
“well,
if
we're
wrong
there
we're
going
to
try
to
at
least
cut
down
on
losses.
why
don't
you
do
it
now?”
the
commission
said
they
would
not
do
it
in
the
interim
because
they
were
still
holding
the
hearing,
but
then
we
won
the
first
case
which
said
that
ab
initio
we
had
the
power
even
though
there
was
not
such
condition.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
because
i
just
don't
think
that
by
reading
the
temporary
authorization
language,
reading
catco
on
remand,
reading
the
general
history
here
that
the
producer
could
reasonably
say
that
he
could
keep
this
money.
now,
the
one
reason
they
gave
which
appealed
to
the
commission
was
that
--
that
while
they
were
collecting
the
higher
amount,
they
were
paying
royalties
and
taxes
to
the
--
royalties
to
the
owner
and
taxes
to
the
state
of
texas
and
since
they
paid
it
not
under
protest,
they
may
not
be
able
to
get
it
back.
so
the
commission
took
care
of
that
saying,
during
the
interim
before
--
from
the
time
you
started
until
skelly
was
decided,
we
will
let
you
deduct
the
taxes.
the
third
reason
they
gave
and
only
two
of
them
gave
this
reason,
namely
humble
and
texas
oil
was
that
by
collecting
these
amounts,
thinking
that
they
were
not
subject
to
refund,
that
they
took
budgetary
positions
and
financing
which
they
otherwise
would
not
have
done.
and
the
commission
there
found
that
involved
with
humble
oil
was
only
$1500
of
refund
and
involved
with
texas
was
only
$25,000
and
since
that
these
are
both
multimillion,
if
not
billion
dollar
corporation,
it
would
beyond
comprehension
that
that
amount
of
money
could
really
affect
their
planning.
the
other
reason
given
was
that
there
was
no
proof
to
these
refunds
would
go
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
the
commission
has
followed
the
policy
there
of
saying
that
we
will
direct
this
money
as
far
down
the
chain
as
we
under
our
power
can
do.
also,
the
new
york
commission
and
the
other
commissions
have
been
very
active
in
seeing
that
this
money
did
go
to
the
ultimate
consumers.
now,
the
fifth
and
last
reason
was
that
you
should
wait
until
the
just
and
reasonable
hearing
before
you
order
the
refund.
now,
if
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
callery
case
had
prevailed,
perhaps
that
would
make
some
sense.
but
once
this
court
in
callery
said
that
you
measure
it
by
the
in-line
price
rather
than
by
the
just
and
reasonable
price
and
i
think
that
reason
goes
by
the
board.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
on
my
argument,
the
basic
issue
here
is
having
one
catco,
having
finally
decided
the
proposition
that
gas
could
not
go
into
interstate
commerce
at
any
price
higher
than
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
price,
does
the
consumer
now
lose
the
ball
--
lose
the
ballgame
by
saying
that
when
you
are
able
to
block
the
producer,
because
they
couldn't
get
a
permanent
certificate
which
required
a
hearing
that
he
can
get
a
greater
rate
by
coming
back
the
next
day,
asking
for
temporary
relief
under
a
letter,
which
letter
the
consumers
never
got
served
with
--
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
there
was
no
hearing,
and
that
that
letter
agreement
has
greater
validity,
more
power
and
more
significance
than
the
permanent
certificate
would
have
had
without
a
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
guideline
prices
ought
to
have
no
effect
whatsoever
your
honor
because
they
were
issued
without
a
contest
and
they
were
strictly
the
suggestion
of
the
commission
as
to
how
it
would
act
internally
pending
the
resolution
of
the
area
rate
case,
pending
the
resolution
of
the
in-line
cases.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
should
not
be
hurt
your
honor
and
i
assure
you
they
won't
be
hurt
--
more
hurt
than
that
of
the
consumer
who
has
litigated,
has
had
a
finding
that
he
is
right,
and
then
finds
out
because
it
took
him
seven
years
to
get
here,
that
that
the
producer
by
a
letter
which
nobody
contested
gets
rights
that
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
if
he'd
asked
for
a
permanent
certificate,
if
the
commission
had
wrongly
issued
the
permanent
certificate
and
would
gotten
here
by
way
of
the
callery
rule.
and
i
would
like
your
honor
or
this
--
i
think
it's
the
brief
for
respondents
sunray
dx,
it's
the
green
one,
on
7
(a)
when
the
commission
made
these
announcements.
and
it
says,
“these
price
levels
as
announced
by
appendix
a
attached
to
this
statement
are
for
the
purpose
of
guidance
and
initial
action
by
the
commission
and
they're
used
to
not
deprived
any
party
of
substantive
rights
or
fix”,
repeat
“or
fix
the
ultimate
justness
and
reasonableness
of
any
rate
level”.
and
actually,
i
think
the
producers
attempted
to
take
the
guidelines
to
court
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
appealable
order
because
it
was
just
a
policy
announcement.
it's
just
as
though
a
commission
may
say,
“well,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
if
you
do
a,
b
and
c,
we
will
not
do
anything.
but
if
some
litigant
comes
in
and
he
makes
a
protest,
we
will
then
hear
it.”
we
did
come
in,
we
made
the
protest
we
want.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor
for
this
reason,
after
these
cases
got
into
the
commission
and
the
consumer's
custody
said,
“well,
certainly
you
can't
continue
to
issue
these
ex
parte
orders
because
we
don't
know
about
them
and
if
these
are
going
affect
our
rights,
we
should
know
about
them”.
by
this
time,
we
had
lost
skelly
so
we
thought
--
we
thought
we
were
right,
but
we
had
to
go
the
court
to
have
our
rights
vindicated
if
we
did.
the
commission
then
for
the
first
time
began
to
take
the
letter
and
put
it
in
the
public
reference
office.
and
the
new
york
commission
by
great
diligence,
by
going
there
everyday,
going
through
every
document,
finally
found
one
which
is
the
j.
ray
mcdermott
which
had
been
issued.
the
commission
then
appealed
that
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
commission
could
not
be
reversed
because
the
order
was
tentative
and
when
you
get
around
to
the
hearing
on
the
permanent
certificate
at
that
point,
the
commission
could
order
that
the
difference
between
the
price
charge
in
the
temporary
and
the
actual
public
convenience
and
necessity
price
should
be
charged.
so,
the
d.c.
circuit
which
is
the
only
circuit
that
has
really
looked
at
all
aspects
of
this
problem
had
made
it
clear
that
that
--
you're
in
a
dilemma
here,
that
if
you
hold
that
the
temporary
certificate
has
this
great
substantive
effect
that
the
producers
would
have,
then
you
certainly
have
to
give
the
consumer
an
opportunity
to
contest
it.
now,
if
you're
going
to
contest
it
before
the
commission,
you
have
to
have
the
same
hearing
that
you
--
that
you
said
you
had
to
have
in
catco.
now,
if
you
had
that
hearing,
it's
going
to
take
you
a
year
or
two
to
get
it
resolved.
now,
if
the
producer
in
the
meantime
is
losing
its
gas
to
the
drainage
or
flaring,
he
can't
afford
to
wait
two
years.
so
the
only
alternative
is
to
issue
an
ex
parte,
to
issue
it
without
a
hearing,
without
a
contest
and
then
when
the
parties
have
the
contest,
determine
that
you
have
to
refund
the
difference
between
what
you
were
charging
and
what
is
determined
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
price.
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did.
mcdermott
and
skelly
oil
and
we
submit
that
that's
the
appropriate
way
that
this
matter
should
be
handled.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
have
been
selling
it
--
because
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
stay
--
they
would
be
selling
it
at
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
the
16
cents.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
i
--
pardon
me.
the
stays
had
been
granted
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
so
they
still
are
selling
it
at
the
18
cents.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
they
could
have
been
doing
that,
your
honor.
you
can
only
fix
an
in-line
price
after
you
had
a
litigated
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
issue
this
here
before
you
now.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
a
direct
appeal,
we
tell
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
we
hope
we
do
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
on
that
point.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
where
they
were
charging
18
cents
under
a
letter,
at
which
we
couldn't
contest
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
we
by
contesting
could
convince
even
the
taft
commission
that
it
should
be
16
cents,
that
we
ought
to
get
the
2
cents
back.
now,
if
we
are
successful
in
this
court,
it
rolls
back
to
15
cents
and
i
think
if
callery
means
anything,
it
means
that
we
get
that
one
penny
back,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
after
a
full
hearing
and
a
trial,
you
--
you
get
the
one
cent
back
under
the
permanent
certificate,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
follows
as
night
as
the
day
although
in
the
law,
a
lot
of
times,
you
can't
be
this
confident
that
you
have
to
give
us
back
the
three
cents
and
that's
what
we
submit
is
the
issue
here.
and
therefore
we
urge
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
well,
it's
not
--
it's
the
public
convenience
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
and
necessity
pricing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
also
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
a
reason
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
a
reasonable
condition
under
section
7
(a)
in
a
permanent
certificate
that
where
a
producer
interjects
gas
in
interstate
commerce
before
he
gets
a
final
certificate
and
he
does
it
under
representation
that
if
you
don't
let
me
do
it,
i'm
going
to
lose
my
gas
forever,
that
is
a
reasonable
condition
for
the
commission
to
say
that
now
that
we've
determined,
you
should
have
been
charging
only
16
cents
if
they're
right,
or
15
cents
if
we're
right,
you
also
have
to
pay
back
the
additional
two
or
three
cents
depending
upon
what
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
if
we
win,
no
further
hearings
would
be
necessary.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
already
been
--
well,
it's
been
--
it's
been
computed
in
the
sense
that
that
--
that
anyone
who
can
read
can
make
the
computation
and
then
i
think
i
under
the
order
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
three
cents,
and
under
the
order
you
could
--
you
have
to
know
how
many
volumes
they
sold.
the
order
says
within
30
days,
they
have
to
come
in
and
file
what
the
figure
is
and
then
they
file
it
and
then
they
pay
it
back.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
thought
that
the
second
half
of
my
argument
was
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
determine
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
up
here
and
that
if
you
send
it
back
--
just
look
at
the
dates,
these
contracts
executed
1960-62.
they
had
got
the
temporary
authorization
in
1961.
the
commission
422
i
think
is
1964,
by
the
time
they
get
around
to
501,
you're
in
1966,
you
then
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
1968
now,
and
these
contracts
are
only
20-year
contracts
your
honor,
at
some
point,
i
think
the
court
ought
to
decide
it
and
decide
it
finally
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
and
not
send
it
back.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
oh
yes.
i
--
well,
only
--
what
callery
says,
your
honor,
that
to
--
if
the
producers
have
been
unjustly
enriched
that
the
remedy
is
that
the
commission
also
impose
interest
and
i
think
that
right
now
is
7%.
and
therefore
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
hard
to
tell
you,
your
honor,
because
our
company
is
really
divided
into
two
parts
in
the
sense
that
we
operate
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
philadelphia
gasworks.
we
also
own
as
a
normal
public
utility
upstate
companies.
i
would
say,
if
you
don't
hold
me
to
the
figure,
it's
about
a
$150,000
or
$200,000.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
it?
that
which
goes
the
upstate
companies,
would
go
back
to
the
consumers
by
way
of
a
rate
reduction.
that
which
comes
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
because
the
city
of
philadelphia
has
an
operating
agreement
with
the
ugi
which
says
that
for
$800,000
regardless
of
the
profit
is,
that's
all
the
ugi
gas.
any
excess
goes
into
the
city
treasurer
and
that
there
are
two
or
three
cases
in
the
seventh
or
eighth
circuit
which
i
think
in
the
natural
gas
case
which
is
the
whole
--
and
as
a
matter
of
law
that
when
you
can
demonstrate,
the
money
goes
back
into
the
general
public
treasure,
that's
the
same
as
if
you
paid
it
to
the
consumer.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
not
only
that,
but
it
helps
us
to
begin
to
solve
some
of
the
tremendous
problems
of
the
urban
community,
so
we'd
very
much
liked
it
to
go
back.
thank
you.
