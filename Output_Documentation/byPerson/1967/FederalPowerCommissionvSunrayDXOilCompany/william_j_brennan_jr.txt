but
the
point
is
--
in
that
would
you
find
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
d.c.
and
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
point
of
view
which
the
commission
didn't
share
until
they
announced
this,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
tell
this
isn't
--
i
thought
capital
railroad
indicated
that
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
public
convenience
and
necessity,
there
are
a
lot
of
different
things,
isn't
it?
this
is
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
really,
it's
really
not
too
clear
that
the
end
results
of
section
7
and
section
5
proceeding
is
the
same,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
perhaps
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black,
they
were
the
same
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tenth
circuit,
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
that's
the
need
issue
was
not
raised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
they
might
have
approved
as
far
as
power
is
concerned
the
expressed
provision
and
there
shall
be
no
refund
with
respect
to
this
right.
they
could
have
gone
that
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
fact
you're
saying
that's
really
what
they
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
here
is
the
correct
analysis,
it's
not
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
a
rate
rather
this
is
in
effect
a
legislative
specification
of
a
rate
which
may
not
be
changed
except
prospectively
because
otherwise,
it
would
be
something
ex
post
facto
in
nature,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
difference
detriment
to
either
of
the
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
he
did
was
spread
that
over
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
gather
then,
the
commission's
position
is
that
it
does
have
power
to
order
refunds
but
it
also
has
power
to
adjust
the
amount
of
refunds
or
eliminate
them
entirely
on
the
showing
by
the
producer
of
what
the
commission
would
regard
as
detriment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
i
gather
it
you
--
you
--
that
the
commission's
present
position
is
that
even
if
we
had
said
we
will
not
ask
for
refunds,
we
nevertheless
have
power
to
order
refunds
unless
we
discover
that
the
reliance
took
the
form
of
a
concrete
detriment
to
the
producer
of
some
kind,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
rates
you
approved
were
actually
agreed
upon
rates,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
the
rates
as
specified
it.
you
specified
what
the
parties
agreed
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
simons,
did
i
understand
you
said
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
condition
a
permanent
certificate
on
refund
after
determination
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
but
did
you
suggest
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
absolutely
right,
i
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
misunderstood
what
you've
said.
