justice
abe
fortas
mr.
schiff,
is
it
possible
that
in
the
section
4
or
section
5
proceeding,
a
company
that
let's
say
in
amerada
case
would
get
a
higher
rate?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
not
relay
the
fact,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
i
got
a
lower
rate,
would
they
--
would
the
commission
have
power
to
require
refunds
to
those
who
had
paid
the
in-line
price?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
how
do
you
work
that
out
on
the
statute?
in
other
words,
if
you
have
power
to
require
a
refund
when
you
fix
an
in-line
price,
why
don't
you
have
a
power
to
require
refunds
when
you
fixed
a
price
under
--
under
section
4
or
section
5
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
a
company
that
has
--
has
had
a
permanent
certificate
and
now
for
the
fixed
in-line
prices,
affecting
that
company,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
none
of
the
companies
affected
by
this
order
has
a
permanent
certificate?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought.
and
--
but
even
there,
you
say
that
the
commission
has
power
to
order
a
refund?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
--
well,
let
me
see.
i
guess
i
don't
understand
this.
is
it
your
position
that
just
as
soon
as
--
as
the
commission
--
does
the
commission
say
that
as
soon
as
a
permanent
certificate
is
issued,
the
power
to
order
refunds
ceases?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
pipeline?
justice
abe
fortas
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
all
we
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
here
is
companies
that
have
received
a
temporary
certificate
so
far
as
the
refund
question
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
sales,
mr.
coleman,
would
they?
justice
abe
fortas
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
sales
before
they
got
the
temporary
authorization?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
that
the
sales
that
they
made
we
made
pursuant
to
the
temporary
authorization
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
although
they
were
under
the
terms
of
a
prior
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
say
about
the
effect,
if
any,
of
the
guideline
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose,
but
it's
possible
that
you
take
a
producer
who
operating
under
a
temporary
certificate
and
he
sold
his
gas
at
the
guideline
price,
a
guideline
price
being
the
commission
price
--
there
was
no
reservation
--
expressed
reservation
in
the
--
or
explicit
or
specific
reservation
in
the
temporary
certificate,
his
feelings
might
be
hurt
if
the
commission
later
ordered
a
refund
cutting
back
behind
the
guideline
price.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
asking
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
asking
for
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
where
could
they
tackle
it
again,
in
the
pipeline
distributor's
hearing?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
contention
that
they
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that
or
what
--
or
just
--
what
is
your
contention?
justice
abe
fortas
too
late
what,
legally
or
physically?
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
why
it's
too
late
practically?
justice
abe
fortas
you
suspect
through
psychology.
justice
abe
fortas
but
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
will
happen
now
is
that
the
--
at
some
--
a
producer
has
been
certificated.
at
some
subsequent
time,
the
pipeline
will
come
in
and
present
to
the
commission
its
application
to
buy
the
gas,
is
that
right,
to
end
up
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
gas.
justice
abe
fortas
for
a
pipeline
construction.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
are
you
complaining
about
the
balance
of
the
25%?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i'll
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
forgive
me
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
--
went
to
my
mind
rightly
or
wrongly
if
the
administrative
reality
of
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
position
as
follows,
taking
these
certificates,
these
producer's
certificates
with
which
we're
dealing
right
now.
is
that
the
position
that
--
let's
say
with
respect
to
75%
of
the
gas
involved,
there
will
be
subsequent
applications
to
construct
pipeline--
justice
abe
fortas
--
facilities
at
which
time
the
need
will
have
to
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
have
i
made
my
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
that
i'm
raising
and
perhaps
somebody
else
will
see,
as
well
see
address
himself
to,
perhaps
the
commission's
counsel
on
rebuttal.
will
there
or
will
there
not,
come
a
point
of
time
at
which
you
and
other
interested
persons
will
have
an
opportunity
as
a
matter
of
administrative
procedure
to
object
to
the
--
to
object
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
need
for
these
facilities?
so
that
if
you
prevail
at
that
time,
the
consumers
whom
you
represent,
will
not
be
settled
with
additional
cost.
that's
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
question
i
stated
as
distilled
as
much
as
i
can
do.
justice
abe
fortas
could
there
be
an
emergency
from
the
point
of
view
of
conservation?
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
a
little
rough
on
the
person
who
owns
--
the
company
who
owns
the
well
that's
being
drained.
justice
abe
fortas
but
theoretically
anyway
there's
no
impact
on
consumer
interest
until
a
pipeline
arrangement
has
been
made.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
simons
that
everything
you
are
saying
tends
to
straighten
the
position
that
the
place
to
tackle
this
problem
is
in
the
pipeline
hearings.
now,
what
--
take
a
step
back
please.
tell
us
why
this
problem
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
apart
from
the
psychological
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
in
reality
â€“-
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
argument
you've
been
making
here
in
response
from
various
questions
seems
to
me
to
be
addressed
to
the
undesirability
for
the
take-or-pay
provision
in
the
pipeline
contracts.
now,
why
should
that
particular
problem
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearing
beyond
a
general
finding
which
the
statute
requires
of
public
convenience
and
necessity?
but
why
--
how
do
all
of
these
considerations
that
you've
been
so
effectively
presenting
to
us
relate
to
the
producer
hearings?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
certificate
that's
issued
to
a
producer's
say
in
terms
of
quantity?does
it
say
anything
about
quantity?
justice
abe
fortas
the
certificate
that's
issued
to
a
producer
in
the
--
in
these
proceedings,
what
does
it
say?
justice
abe
fortas
to
make
the
sale,
this
sale
as
filed?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
producer's
certificate.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
you're
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
is
the
time
at
which
there
ought
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
terms
of
the
contract
for
the
--
for
its
bearing
upon
me?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
interstate?
justice
abe
fortas
not
intra?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
that
would
--
that
would
illegally
being
shared
hard
enough.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
if
that's
the
amount
to
pay
i
have
to
spend
in
one
year
to
discharge
a
take-or-pay
obligation?
justice
abe
fortas
what
year
was
that
commission
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
killbourne
your
position
is
that
the
in-line
price
supplied
to
your
client
was
too
low?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
johnson
had
proceeded
here
for
shell
and
some
others,
are
you
still
talking
about
districts
2
and
3?
justice
abe
fortas
district
3,
mr.
johnson
talked
about
2
and
3.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
among
some
of
the
producers
represented
here?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
district
3.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
line
up
for
the
day,
this
ball
game
is.
let's
just
take
district
3.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
correctly
assume
that
mr.
johnson's
position
for
his
clients
is
that
they
support
the
in-line
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
for
this
court.
you
for
superior
oil
i
think
is
too
low.
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
ever
been
an
approval
of
the
rights
and
charges
under
these
temporary
certificates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
the
temporary
certificate
say
specifically,
expressly
and
in
so
many
words
that
the
acceptance
of
a
temporary
filing
is
not
to
be
considered
as
approval
of
the
rates
and
charges?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
had
followed
your
argument,
so
that
from
a
one
point
of
view
anyway
because
i'm
far
from
coming
to
rest
on
this
but
from
one
point
of
view,
it
could
be
said
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
analytically
a
refund
but
for
the
first
time,
the
approval
of
a
price
under
the
temporary
certificate
--
justice
abe
fortas
of
course,
you
would.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
if
i'm
correct
there
maybe
have
some
significance
that
all
of
the
temporary
certificates
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
did
specifically
recite
that
the
temporary
certification
does
not
constitute
approval
of
any
rates
and
charges.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
your
judgment,
does
a
commission
have
the
power
to
issue
an
authorization
to
a
producer,
without
approving
the
price,
without
any
approved
price.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
you
take
--
go
back
to
the
temporary
authorizations
themselves
they
have
not
approved
the
price.
and
then
you
get
all
these
stashing
back
and
forth
as
it
seems
to
be
on
the
part
of
the
commission
but
you
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
there
has
not
been
an
approved
price
under
this
temporary
authorization.
what
then
affects
and
it's
arguable
therefore
that
what
they're
in
effect
doing
now
in
addition
to
fixing
a
prospective
price
is
to
fix
a
price
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
sales
under
these
temporary
certificates.
i
don't
know
whether
that
squares
with
the
commission's
idea
of
a
statute,
what
they're
doing
or
not.
i
am
impressed
with
your
argument
about
this
february
5
order
particularly
what
is
said
on
page
157
of
the
record.
but
to
look
at
this
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
refund,
you
do
have
a
february
5th
order
statements
by
the
commission
which
seemed
clearly
to
indicate
they
don't
think
that
they
doubt
that
they've
got
the
power
to
do
it.
and
if
they
did
they
have
the
power
to
do
it,
that
they
thought
this
would
be
kind
of
short
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
but
on
the
other
hand
that
if
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
they
have
the
power
to
do
what?
justice
abe
fortas
without
approving
the
price.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
asking
you
though.
justice
abe
fortas
well
they
do
it
in
some
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you
for
that.
would
you
look
at
page
72
of
volume
1
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
page
72.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
say
a
temporary
certification
isn't
it,
for
--
to
the
sunray
oil
company?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
page
72,
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph,
it
says,
this
acceptance
per
filing
shall
not
be
construed
as
constituting
approval
of
any
rate
charged
classification
etcetera
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
obtained
in
the
filing.
and
then
i
look
at
the
standard
of
texas
temporary
certificates
towards
to
just
direct
our
attention.
those
don't'
have
that
provision
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
that
is
do
you
contend
but
the
temporary
certification
which
your
client
received
does
constitute
an
approval
in
any
degree
of
the
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
be
a
little
more
blunt
for
me.
do
you
or
do
you
not
regard
it
as
an
approval
of
the
rate
until
it
changes?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
that
the
situation
would
be
different
than
the
case
of
your
client
than
it
would
be
in
the
case
of
sun
oil
under
the
temporary
certificate
to
which
i
directed
your
attention.
justice
abe
fortas
well
how
can
you
say
that
the
sun
oil
temporary
certification
is
in
approval
of
the
rate
when
it
says
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
sometimes
it
says
--
let's
assume
and
i
think
it's
right
that
february
5
order
says
we
won't
order
--
we
won't
add
a
refund
condition.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
still
isn't
right
on
the
button
because
i
--
you
have
to
leave
out
an
important
word,
that
little
word
not
in
the
sun
oil
certification
to
reach
your
result
and
you
have
to
say
you're
leaving
it
out
because
of
some
other
things
outside
of
the
temporary
certification
itself
and
that's
what
you're
arguing.
that's
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
a
few
possible
positions.
one
that
temporary
certification
did
approve
the
rate.
justice
abe
fortas
two,
that
the
--
despite
the
fact
that
the
temporary
certification
said
that
it
did
not.
two,
that
the
temporary
certification
did
not
approve
the
rates
and
nothing
subsequently
changed
that.
the
--
three,
that
approval
of
the
rates
was
not
necessary
and
that
the
commission's
february
5
statement
that
it
would
not
order
refunds
as
governs
and
is
binding
on
the
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
really
have
to
conceive,
don't
you,
that
your
action
here
is
contrary
to
that
february
5
order,
to
the
language
of
the
february
5
order.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
myself
don't
think
you
could
say
stated
position
against
refunds
because
they
are
more
empathetically
than
it
was
said
in
chairman
swidler's
opinion
for
the
commission
on
february
5.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
schiff,
does
a
--
does
the
commission
have
the
power
to
--
under
the
statute,
to
issue
a
permanent
or
temporary
certificate
without
approving
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
without
approving
rates,
sometimes,
somehow,
someway.
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
issued
temporary
certificates
here
did
the
commission
or
did
it
not
approve
the
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
--
provision
was
cited
in
the
sun
oil
temporary
certificate
for
example
that
it
did
not
approve
the
rates.
justice
abe
fortas
then
they
have
to
come
with
time
under
this
statute
when
the
commissioners
to
approve
the
rate?
justice
abe
fortas
not
if
you
don't
have
power
to
ref
--
to
order
refund?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
schiff
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
no
reparations
prior
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sure
my
brothers
brennan
is
on
certainty
about
what
the
commission's
position
is
on
that
range
of
possibilities.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
schiff,
is
it
possible
that
in
the
section
4
or
section
5
proceeding,
a
company
that
let's
say
in
amerada
case
would
get
a
higher
rate?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
not
relay
the
fact,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
i
got
a
lower
rate,
would
they
--
would
the
commission
have
power
to
require
refunds
to
those
who
had
paid
the
in-line
price?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
how
do
you
work
that
out
on
the
statute?
in
other
words,
if
you
have
power
to
require
a
refund
when
you
fix
an
in-line
price,
why
don't
you
have
a
power
to
require
refunds
when
you
fixed
a
price
under
--
under
section
4
or
section
5
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
a
company
that
has
--
has
had
a
permanent
certificate
and
now
for
the
fixed
in-line
prices,
affecting
that
company,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
none
of
the
companies
affected
by
this
order
has
a
permanent
certificate?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought.
and
--
but
even
there,
you
say
that
the
commission
has
power
to
order
a
refund?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
--
well,
let
me
see.
i
guess
i
don't
understand
this.
is
it
your
position
that
just
as
soon
as
--
as
the
commission
--
does
the
commission
say
that
as
soon
as
a
permanent
certificate
is
issued,
the
power
to
order
refunds
ceases?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
pipeline?
justice
abe
fortas
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
all
we
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
here
is
companies
that
have
received
a
temporary
certificate
so
far
as
the
refund
question
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
sales,
mr.
coleman,
would
they?
justice
abe
fortas
they
wouldn't
have
made
the
sales
before
they
got
the
temporary
authorization?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
that
the
sales
that
they
made
we
made
pursuant
to
the
temporary
authorization
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
although
they
were
under
the
terms
of
a
prior
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
say
about
the
effect,
if
any,
of
the
guideline
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose,
but
it's
possible
that
you
take
a
producer
who
operating
under
a
temporary
certificate
and
he
sold
his
gas
at
the
guideline
price,
a
guideline
price
being
the
commission
price
--
there
was
no
reservation
--
expressed
reservation
in
the
--
or
explicit
or
specific
reservation
in
the
temporary
certificate,
his
feelings
might
be
hurt
if
the
commission
later
ordered
a
refund
cutting
back
behind
the
guideline
price.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
asking
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
asking
for
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
where
could
they
tackle
it
again,
in
the
pipeline
distributor's
hearing?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
contention
that
they
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that
or
what
--
or
just
--
what
is
your
contention?
justice
abe
fortas
too
late
what,
legally
or
physically?
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
why
it's
too
late
practically?
justice
abe
fortas
you
suspect
through
psychology.
justice
abe
fortas
but
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
will
happen
now
is
that
the
--
at
some
--
a
producer
has
been
certificated.
at
some
subsequent
time,
the
pipeline
will
come
in
and
present
to
the
commission
its
application
to
buy
the
gas,
is
that
right,
to
end
up
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
gas.
justice
abe
fortas
for
a
pipeline
construction.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
are
you
complaining
about
the
balance
of
the
25%?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i'll
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
forgive
me
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
--
went
to
my
mind
rightly
or
wrongly
if
the
administrative
reality
of
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
position
as
follows,
taking
these
certificates,
these
producer's
certificates
with
which
we're
dealing
right
now.
is
that
the
position
that
--
let's
say
with
respect
to
75%
of
the
gas
involved,
there
will
be
subsequent
applications
to
construct
pipeline--
justice
abe
fortas
--
facilities
at
which
time
the
need
will
have
to
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
have
i
made
my
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
that
i'm
raising
and
perhaps
somebody
else
will
see,
as
well
see
address
himself
to,
perhaps
the
commission's
counsel
on
rebuttal.
will
there
or
will
there
not,
come
a
point
of
time
at
which
you
and
other
interested
persons
will
have
an
opportunity
as
a
matter
of
administrative
procedure
to
object
to
the
--
to
object
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
need
for
these
facilities?
so
that
if
you
prevail
at
that
time,
the
consumers
whom
you
represent,
will
not
be
settled
with
additional
cost.
that's
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
question
i
stated
as
distilled
as
much
as
i
can
do.
justice
abe
fortas
could
there
be
an
emergency
from
the
point
of
view
of
conservation?
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
a
little
rough
on
the
person
who
owns
--
the
company
who
owns
the
well
that's
being
drained.
justice
abe
fortas
but
theoretically
anyway
there's
no
impact
on
consumer
interest
until
a
pipeline
arrangement
has
been
made.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
simons
that
everything
you
are
saying
tends
to
straighten
the
position
that
the
place
to
tackle
this
problem
is
in
the
pipeline
hearings.
now,
what
--
take
a
step
back
please.
tell
us
why
this
problem
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
apart
from
the
psychological
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
in
reality
â€“-
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
argument
you've
been
making
here
in
response
from
various
questions
seems
to
me
to
be
addressed
to
the
undesirability
for
the
take-or-pay
provision
in
the
pipeline
contracts.
now,
why
should
that
particular
problem
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearing
beyond
a
general
finding
which
the
statute
requires
of
public
convenience
and
necessity?
but
why
--
how
do
all
of
these
considerations
that
you've
been
so
effectively
presenting
to
us
relate
to
the
producer
hearings?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
certificate
that's
issued
to
a
producer's
say
in
terms
of
quantity?does
it
say
anything
about
quantity?
justice
abe
fortas
the
certificate
that's
issued
to
a
producer
in
the
--
in
these
proceedings,
what
does
it
say?
justice
abe
fortas
to
make
the
sale,
this
sale
as
filed?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
producer's
certificate.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
you're
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
is
the
time
at
which
there
ought
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
terms
of
the
contract
for
the
--
for
its
bearing
upon
me?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
interstate?
justice
abe
fortas
not
intra?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
that
would
--
that
would
illegally
being
shared
hard
enough.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
if
that's
the
amount
to
pay
i
have
to
spend
in
one
year
to
discharge
a
take-or-pay
obligation?
justice
abe
fortas
what
year
was
that
commission
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
killbourne
your
position
is
that
the
in-line
price
supplied
to
your
client
was
too
low?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
johnson
had
proceeded
here
for
shell
and
some
others,
are
you
still
talking
about
districts
2
and
3?
justice
abe
fortas
district
3,
mr.
johnson
talked
about
2
and
3.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
among
some
of
the
producers
represented
here?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
district
3.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
line
up
for
the
day,
this
ball
game
is.
let's
just
take
district
3.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
correctly
assume
that
mr.
johnson's
position
for
his
clients
is
that
they
support
the
in-line
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
for
this
court.
you
for
superior
oil
i
think
is
too
low.
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
ever
been
an
approval
of
the
rights
and
charges
under
these
temporary
certificates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
the
temporary
certificate
say
specifically,
expressly
and
in
so
many
words
that
the
acceptance
of
a
temporary
filing
is
not
to
be
considered
as
approval
of
the
rates
and
charges?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
had
followed
your
argument,
so
that
from
a
one
point
of
view
anyway
because
i'm
far
from
coming
to
rest
on
this
but
from
one
point
of
view,
it
could
be
said
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
analytically
a
refund
but
for
the
first
time,
the
approval
of
a
price
under
the
temporary
certificate
--
justice
abe
fortas
of
course,
you
would.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
if
i'm
correct
there
maybe
have
some
significance
that
all
of
the
temporary
certificates
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
did
specifically
recite
that
the
temporary
certification
does
not
constitute
approval
of
any
rates
and
charges.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
your
judgment,
does
a
commission
have
the
power
to
issue
an
authorization
to
a
producer,
without
approving
the
price,
without
any
approved
price.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
you
take
--
go
back
to
the
temporary
authorizations
themselves
they
have
not
approved
the
price.
and
then
you
get
all
these
stashing
back
and
forth
as
it
seems
to
be
on
the
part
of
the
commission
but
you
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
there
has
not
been
an
approved
price
under
this
temporary
authorization.
what
then
affects
and
it's
arguable
therefore
that
what
they're
in
effect
doing
now
in
addition
to
fixing
a
prospective
price
is
to
fix
a
price
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
sales
under
these
temporary
certificates.
i
don't
know
whether
that
squares
with
the
commission's
idea
of
a
statute,
what
they're
doing
or
not.
i
am
impressed
with
your
argument
about
this
february
5
order
particularly
what
is
said
on
page
157
of
the
record.
but
to
look
at
this
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
refund,
you
do
have
a
february
5th
order
statements
by
the
commission
which
seemed
clearly
to
indicate
they
don't
think
that
they
doubt
that
they've
got
the
power
to
do
it.
and
if
they
did
they
have
the
power
to
do
it,
that
they
thought
this
would
be
kind
of
short
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
but
on
the
other
hand
that
if
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
they
have
the
power
to
do
what?
justice
abe
fortas
without
approving
the
price.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
asking
you
though.
justice
abe
fortas
well
they
do
it
in
some
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you
for
that.
would
you
look
at
page
72
of
volume
1
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
page
72.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
say
a
temporary
certification
isn't
it,
for
--
to
the
sunray
oil
company?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
page
72,
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph,
it
says,
this
acceptance
per
filing
shall
not
be
construed
as
constituting
approval
of
any
rate
charged
classification
etcetera
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
obtained
in
the
filing.
and
then
i
look
at
the
standard
of
texas
temporary
certificates
towards
to
just
direct
our
attention.
those
don't'
have
that
provision
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
that
is
do
you
contend
but
the
temporary
certification
which
your
client
received
does
constitute
an
approval
in
any
degree
of
the
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
be
a
little
more
blunt
for
me.
do
you
or
do
you
not
regard
it
as
an
approval
of
the
rate
until
it
changes?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
that
the
situation
would
be
different
than
the
case
of
your
client
than
it
would
be
in
the
case
of
sun
oil
under
the
temporary
certificate
to
which
i
directed
your
attention.
justice
abe
fortas
well
how
can
you
say
that
the
sun
oil
temporary
certification
is
in
approval
of
the
rate
when
it
says
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
sometimes
it
says
--
let's
assume
and
i
think
it's
right
that
february
5
order
says
we
won't
order
--
we
won't
add
a
refund
condition.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
still
isn't
right
on
the
button
because
i
--
you
have
to
leave
out
an
important
word,
that
little
word
not
in
the
sun
oil
certification
to
reach
your
result
and
you
have
to
say
you're
leaving
it
out
because
of
some
other
things
outside
of
the
temporary
certification
itself
and
that's
what
you're
arguing.
that's
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
a
few
possible
positions.
one
that
temporary
certification
did
approve
the
rate.
justice
abe
fortas
two,
that
the
--
despite
the
fact
that
the
temporary
certification
said
that
it
did
not.
two,
that
the
temporary
certification
did
not
approve
the
rates
and
nothing
subsequently
changed
that.
the
--
three,
that
approval
of
the
rates
was
not
necessary
and
that
the
commission's
february
5
statement
that
it
would
not
order
refunds
as
governs
and
is
binding
on
the
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
really
have
to
conceive,
don't
you,
that
your
action
here
is
contrary
to
that
february
5
order,
to
the
language
of
the
february
5
order.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
myself
don't
think
you
could
say
stated
position
against
refunds
because
they
are
more
empathetically
than
it
was
said
in
chairman
swidler's
opinion
for
the
commission
on
february
5.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
schiff,
does
a
--
does
the
commission
have
the
power
to
--
under
the
statute,
to
issue
a
permanent
or
temporary
certificate
without
approving
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
without
approving
rates,
sometimes,
somehow,
someway.
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
issued
temporary
certificates
here
did
the
commission
or
did
it
not
approve
the
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
--
provision
was
cited
in
the
sun
oil
temporary
certificate
for
example
that
it
did
not
approve
the
rates.
justice
abe
fortas
then
they
have
to
come
with
time
under
this
statute
when
the
commissioners
to
approve
the
rate?
justice
abe
fortas
not
if
you
don't
have
power
to
ref
--
to
order
refund?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
schiff
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
no
reparations
prior
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sure
my
brothers
brennan
is
on
certainty
about
what
the
commission's
position
is
on
that
range
of
possibilities.
