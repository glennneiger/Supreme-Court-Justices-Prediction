mr.
morton
l.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
these
cases
on
behalf
of
four
clients,
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
a
regulatory
agency
of
that
state,
and
three
public
utilities
serving
in
the
philadelphia,
new
york
area;
philadelphia
electric
company,
brooklyn
union
gas
company,
long
island
lighting
company.
we
appear
in
these
cases
are
representatives
of
the
consumer
interest.
in
these
proceedings
before
the
commission,
the
contest
was
between
the
producers
who
are
regulated
by
the
commission
and
who
were
the
applicants
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
on
the
one
hand
and
ourselves
with
some
general
support
from
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
other.
there
are
three
principal
issues
in
this
case;
their
short
form
is
need,
in-line
and
refund.
on
the
need
issue,
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
can
grant
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
the
producer
applicants
authorizing
them
to
make
their
sales
in
interstate
commerce
without
first
making
a
finding
that
there
is
a
public
need
for
the
gas
proposed
to
be
sold.
on
that
issue
it
was
our
position
that
the
commission
was
required
to
make
a
finding
of
need.
the
commission
held
that
it
was
not.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
decision
by
a
chief
judge
bazelon
agreed
with
us
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
that
issue.
on
the
second
question,
the
so
called
in-line
issue,
the
question
is
at
what
initial
price
should
the
commission
certificate
these
sales
to
be
sold.
in
each
of
the
three
dockets,
the
commission
elevated
the
in-line
price
that
it
had
previously
found
for
each
of
the
three
areas
by
one
cent
per
mcf
to
correspond
with
a
guideline
level
that
it
had
previously
announced.
we
challenged
that
once
in
escalation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
has
affirmed
the
commission's
escalation
in
the
district
4
case
amerada.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
reversed
the
commission's
escalation
in
the
districts
2
and
3
case,
hawkins
and
sinclair.
the
commission,
i
should
add,
decide
at
that
one
against
us
also
as
it
had
decided
the
need
issue.
the
final
issue
in
the
case
is
if
the
sales
are
certificated,
should
the
producers
make
refunds
of
the
amounts
that
they
have
collected
under
temporary
certificates
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation
to
the
extent
that
those
collections
exceed
the
in-line
price
as
finally
determined
by
the
commission
after
hearing.
as
indicated
by
other
counsel
earlier,
the
commission
originally
held
in
a
prior
opinion,
the
skelly
oil
opinion
in
august
of
1962,
that
it
would
not
require
refunds.
we,
along
with
mr.
coleman's
client,
united
gas
improvement
company
appealed
that
decision
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
in
january
'64
held
that
the
commission
could
not
excuse
refunds
merely
because
there
had
been
no
expressed
refund
condition
in
the
temporary,
that
this
court
denied
certiorari
after
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision.
and
up
to
that
time,
the
commission
had
decided
against
us.
after
that
decision,
the
commission
substantially
decided
in
our
favor.
accordingly,
on
these
three
issues
we
are
opposed
to
the
commission
on
need
and
in-line
and
we
in
the
commission
are
now
in
agreement
on
the
third
question,
refund,
although
there
is
a
slight
difference
which
i
will
get
to
when
i
discuss
that
issue.
now,
it
appears
to
us
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
commission
went
wrong
here
is
because
it
overlooked
the
very
basic
elements
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
want
just
for
a
moment
to
go
back
to
the
basics
that
are
involved
in
the
natural
gas
act.
these
are
very
elementary
matters.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
being
so
basic.
but
i
think
that
even
as
expert
a
body
is
the
commission
may
have
jumped
in
a
little
too
late.
may
not
have
gone
back
into
what
the
gas
act
is
all
about.
this
court
has
reminded
that
time
and
time
again,
that
the
natural
gas
act
is
designed
to
protect
the
consumer.
it
is
a
piece
of
consumer
protective
legislation.
that
is
its
purpose.
that
is
its
design.
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
given
to
it
by
this
court.
this
court
has
phrased
that
protection
in
various
ways,
at
various
times
but
it
has
always
been
extremely
consistent.
it
was
to
protect
the
consumer
from
exploitation
of
the
hands
of
natural
gas
companies.
it
was
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
douglas
used
in
the
hope
case
back
in
the
40s.
that
phrase
was
repeated
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
in
the
late
50s
and
the
early
60s.
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
catco
case
which
is
really
the
lead
case
so
far
as
this
whole
area
of
producer
certification
under
section
7
is
concerned,
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
a
complete,
permanent,
and
effective
bond
of
protection
to
the
consumer
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
this
then
is
the
purpose
of
the
act.
and
i
think
that
it
is
interesting
both
in
the
commission's
opinion
to
some
extent
in
its
brief
and
on
argument
yesterday
that
commission
counsel
has
noted
that
the
commission
has
taken
a
middle
ground
between
the
consumer
contentions
and
the
producer
contentions.
now,
that
maybe
a
perfectly
accurate
description
of
what
the
commission
did,
and
i
will
come
to
that
later
too.
but
i
don't
think
that
is
--
it
is
any
sort
of
a
defense
for
the
commission
to
make
of
its
actions
here.
it
is
not
charged
by
statute
with
adopting
a
middle
ground
between
contending
conditions
--
positions.
it
is
charged
with
protecting
the
consumer
and
that
is
an
affirmative
duty.
and
when
it
has
failed
to
discharge
that
duty,
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
found
it
necessary
to
remind
the
commission
of
its
duty
and
to
reverse
the
commission's
action.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
and
i
--
let
me
make
perfectly
clear,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
by
saying
that
we
are
consumer
representatives
does
not
relieve
us
one
iota
of
the
burden
of
making
persuasive
arguments
in
the
statutory
terms
to
you
and
to
persuade
you.
and
i
meant
to
obtain
no
advantage
in
that
sense.
i
merely
wanted
to
indicate
what
our
interest
was.
the
commission
is
certainly
not
bound
to
accept
a
contention
because
we
make
it.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
it's
discharging
its
duty
to
say
that
it
hit
somewhere
in
between
the
two
contentions.
its
obligation
is
to
do
what
the
statute
commands
it
to
do,
not
to
mediate
to
opposing
contentions.
it's
not
a
mediation
board.
it
has
affirmative
duties.
now,
the
section
of
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
is
section
7.
that
came
into
the
act
in
1942.
the
original
act
was
passed
in
'38.
the
original
act
had
--
the
heart
of
the
original
act
if
you
will
was
sections
4
and
5
which
gave
the
commission
control
over
rates.
section
7
came
in
1942.
that
was
the
certificate
section.
and
it
says
in
essence,
that
no
person
may
sell
natural
gas
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
without
first
obtaining
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
commission.
when
an
applicant
seeks
a
certificate,
the
commission
is
charged
by
statute
with
giving
notice
and
providing
for
a
hearing.
the
hearing
is
statutorily
required;
the
commission
has
no
power
or
authority
to
waive
a
hearing
on
a
certificate
application.
if
at
the
hearing,
it
is
found
among
other
things,
that
the
certificate
is
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
i
think
that
required
in
the
context
of
the
need
issue
certainly
is
the
keyword
here.
if
the
sale
proposed
to
be
made
is
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
then
a
certificate
shall
issue.
otherwise,
it
shall
be
denied.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
on
need?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
yes
it
is.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
indeed.
there
are
two
other
aspects
of
the
statute
which
should
be
mentioned.
one
is
the
commission
has
a
conditioning
power
to
cure
a
proposal
that
is
largely
correct
but
partially
incorrect.
the
commission
does
not
have
to
deny
it
in
total.
it
can
condition
its
approval
on
deletion
of
the
unsatisfactory
aspects.
and
it
was
its
conditioning
power
that
led
to
the
in-line
conditioning
concept
in
this
court's
1959
catco
decision.
there
is
another
provision
of
the
act
that
provides
in
cases
of
emergency,
the
commission
may
during
the
pendency
of
a
decision
on
the
application
for
a
certificate,
grant
a
temporary
certificate
without
notice
and
without
hearing.
this
is
an
emergency
power.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that
is
its
contention,
mr.
justice
harlan.
our
problem
essentially
is
this.
in
reading
yesterday
to
you
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
this
is
in
volume
4
of
the
appendix
--
at
appendix
page
266,
mr.
schiff
read,
a
large
part
starting
over
at
265
and
ending
on
to
266.
this
is
judge
bazelon's
decision
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
he
stopped,
however,
prior
to
what
i
think
must
be
agreed
as
the
operative
part
really
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
after
discussing
what
the
court
was
not
deciding
judge
bazelon
states,
“we
decide
only
that
when
a
party
makes
a
non-frivolous
claim
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
public
need
for
the
gas,
the
fpc
must
give
considered
reasons
if
it
decides
otherwise.
its
decision
must
be
made
before”
and
that
word
is
emphasized
in
the
court
below.
“its
decision
must
be
made
before
it
grants
a
permanent
certificate
to
the
producer.”
now,
we
think
that
at
the
time
it
issues
a
certificate,
it
has
to
make
a
finding
of
need.
if
it
has
made
a
finding
of
need
that
is
appropriate
and
applicable
in
some
other
proceeding,
certainly
it
can
refer
to
that.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
our
problem
is
that
it
did
not
purport
to
refer
to
any
other
finding
of
need
that
it
had
made.
that
the
orders
that
it
was
issue
in
contemporaneous
cases
indicated
that
the
pipeline
purchasers
here
involved
were
in
a
severe
take-or-pay
situation
in
which
they
had
contracted
to
pay
for
more
gas
than
they
could
physically
take
into
their
system.
and
i
think
it
is
agreed
that
that
situation
imposes
additional
cost
on
the
pipeline
which
will
eventually
be
born
by
the
consumer.
our
problem
with
a
lot
of
what
the
commission
has
done
is
that,
the
cost
goes
through
the
consumer
that
we
are
being
called
upon
to
pay
for
much
of
the
commission's
action,
and
we
don't
feel
that
its
action
is
appropriate.
now,
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
before
it
issued
its
certificate.
the
thought
that
it
can
consider
it
elsewhere,
if
you
analyze
what
they
say
very
closely,
i
think,
and
i
do
want
to
be
fair
that
the
commission
here.
but
i
think
that
what
you
are
left
with
is,
they're
saying
they
could
examine
it
elsewhere.
they
do
not
really
say
that
it
is
examined
elsewhere
or
that
as
to
these
dockets,
it
has
been
examined
elsewhere.
it's
remarkable
to
me
that
throughout
this
entire
case,
they
have
nowhere
pointed
to
what
other
orders
they
were
talking
about.
where
they
decided
that
there
was
some
need,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
say
in
august
1963,
in
such
and
such
an
order
we
considered
this
problem,
we're
relying
on
that.
there
has
never
been
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
they
could
in
the
pipeline
hearing
surely,
no
question.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
oh,
it's
too
late
i
--
i
think.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
legally
and
practically.
i
suppose
physically
it's
not.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
what
the
commi
--
i
think
that
there
is
a
human
tendency
to
ratify
what
you
have
done.
and
i
think
that
if
you
have
already
certificated
producers
to
sell
100,000
mcf
a
day
to
a
pipeline
and
they
are
selling
it,
and
they
have
been
selling
it
for
two
to
three
years,
that
when
you
come
to
decide
whether
the
pipeline
has
a
need
for
that
gas
two
or
three
years
later,
you're
going
to
find
that
they
do.
you're
not
going
to
find
that
you'll
need
a
silly
decision
three
years
ago.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
indeed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
not
really.
not
really
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
the
principle
pipeline
proceedings
are
proceedings
in
which
the
pipeline
is
seeking
authority
to
construct
facilities,
to
make
sales,
and
to
make
sales
itself.
and
the
issue
of
pipeline
need
in
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
is,
does
the
pipeline
have
enough
gas
to
make
the
sale
that
it
is
proposing
feasible?
now,
it
is
true
that
in
some
cases
perhaps
many
did,
although
the
figure
isn't
in
the
record
the
commission
council
yesterday
said
about
75%
of
the
gas
involved
some
sort
of
the
future
sales,
involved
some
sort
of
pipeline
application.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
construction,
yes.
it
is
possible
that
the
issue
could
be
raised
there
but
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
i'm
complaining
about
the
100%.
because
(voice
overlap)
the
statutory
scheme
says
such
a
review
in
section
7
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
at
the
time
you
issue
a
certificate
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
there
are
apparently
were
some
conglomeration
of
various
hearings
in
which
authority
for
the
relatively
minor
facilities
to
attach
the
gas
have
been
held,
have
been
noticed
and
certificates
issued
in
the
past.
there
was
one
case
that
did
go
to
hearing,
the
lone
star
gathering
case
subsequent
to
this.
i
do
want
to
point
--
as
i
simply,
the
principal
type
of
pipeline
case,
the
case
where
the
pipeline
wants
to
make
sales.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
so.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
you
have.
i
want
to
get
to
the
budget
type
authority.
each
year,
several
years
ago,
the
commission
adopted
a
regulation.
there
had
been
a
contention
that
for
the
relatively
minor
facilities,
a
pipeline
might
need
to
attach
to
supplies.
and
in
some
cases,
apparently
25%
of
the
cases,
it
might
mean
no
facilities
at
all
to
attach
supplies.
the
sale
might
be
made
out
in
an
existing
point
on
the
pipeline's
facilities.
the
pipeline
each
year
will
say
we
would
like
general
blanket
authority
to
construct
such
facilities
as
we
need
to
attach
such
gas
as
we
may
buy
from
time
to
time.
the
gas
is
not
identified,
the
facilities
are
not
identified.
the
commission
said
in
adopting
this
regulation,
that
it
had
been
proposed
to
exempt
these
facilities
altogether
since
they
were
not
sales
facilities.
and
the
act
speaks
in
terms
of
sales,
regulating
sales,
and
the
facility
is
used
to
make
sales.
they
said,
“we
won't
exempt
them
altogether.
we'll
give
these
blanket
authorities.”
so
i
supposed
that
it
is
in
those
proceedings
where
the
pipeline
gets
whatever
authority
it
needs
but
there
is
no
study
in
those
proceedings
as
to
whether
the
pipeline
has
a
need
for
the
gas
or
not.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
at
no
time
in
the
future.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
i
think
i
understand
here
the
question,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
the
reason
for
the
answer
is
that
the
commission
says
that
there
have
been
other
proceedings
at
some
other
times.
they
are
not
identified.
they
say
some
of
them
perhaps
were
before
these
hearings
came
on.
some
were
after
these
hearings
came
on
but
they
were
not
identified
in
any
general
sense.
they
were
by
and
large,
this
budget
applications
which
there's
a
one
or
two-page
notice
that
identifies
nothing.
now,
there
was
one
proceeding
in
the
sinclair
case
about
almost
half
of
the
gas
in
the
sinclair
case
was
proposed
to
be
sold
to
lone
star
gathering
company
for
in
district
two,
lone
star
was
a
short
line
that
would
gather
the
gas,
do
what
processing
was
necessary,
resell
it
to
united
gas
pipeline.
the
sales
to
lone
star
were
included
in
the
sinclair
proceeding.
the
applications
of
lone
star
and
united
had
been
filed
sometime
before
we
had
intervened
in
that
proceeding.
the
commission
never
set
it
for
hearing.
it
issued
temporary
certificates
to
the
pipelines.
it
issued
first
temporaries
then
permanent
certificates
in
sinclair
to
the
producers
to
make
the
sale.
after
it
had
issued
the
certificates
to
sinclair,
it
set
lone
star
and
united
applications
for
hearing.
we
participated
in
that
hearing.
and
what
happened
was
very
interesting.
after
it
went
through
the
hearing
the
first
time,
the
commission
found
--
the
majority
of
the
commission
found
that
united
had
a
need
for
the
gas
and
it
should
be
approved.
and
what
they
had
done
in
sinclair
was
right.
and
the
concurring
opinion
on
that
case
pointed
out
that
all
the
commission
really
was
doing,
was
ratifying
its
prior
sinclair
opinion.
it
pointed
out
that
as
a
human
psychological
matter
if
you
will,
unless
need
as
examined
when
the
producers
have
their
applications
pending,
it
will
never
be
examined
at
all.
in
any
event,
the
commission
finally
need
issued
a
certificate.
we
then
applied
for
rehearing,
pointing
out
the
numerous
legal
and
factual
areas
that
the
commission
had
made.
the
commission
on
rehearing
concluded
that
united,
the
ultimate
purchaser
from
lone
star
gathering,
had
not
adequately
shown
need,
that
there
were
a
number
of
defects
in
its
presentation,
and
set
the
matter
rather
than
denied
a
certificate.
however,
it
set
the
matter
down
so
that
lone
star
and
united
could
try
a
second
time
to
prove
need.lone
star
and
united
first
ask
for
postponement,
another
postponement.
then
they
said,
“we
give
up.
we
really
don't
need
the
gas
if
that's
what
we
have
to
prove.”
their
certificates
were
cancelled
or
the
permanent
certificates
were
simply
revoked,
that
had
never
become
--
the
permanent
certificates
had
never
become
final.
and
that
gas
is
no
longer
being
sold
in
interstate
commerce,
almost
half
of
the
gas
in
the
sinclair
proceeding.
i
think
that
when
you
count,
if
there
is
a
time
to
test
it
and
particularly
if
the
judgment
is
not
clouded
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
already
granted
permanent
certification,
then
i
think
we
will
have
some
very
interesting
results
on
whether
there
is
a
need
for
gas
and
how
much
of
the
need.
but
the
statute
says
before
you
can
issue
a
certificate,
you
must
find
that
there's
a
need.
and
i
really
don't
understand
how
it
is
in
answered
to
say
“well,
we'll
issue
this
certificate
first
and
we
may
find
a
need
a
year
from
now
or
two
years
from
now
or
in
some
other
proceeding.”
the
statute
seems
to
say,
and
it
would
be
consistent
with
all
statutes
filing
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
that
before
you
issue
a
certificate
you
have
to
find
that
somebody
needs
the
service
or
the
sale
that's
proposed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
we
would
think
that
the
basic
question
here
is,
is
there
a
need
for
a
gas?
if
there
is
a
need
for
gas
--
if
there
is
no
need,
no
certificate.
if
there
is
a
need,
then
the
question
becomes
at
what
price,
what
initial
price
should
the
gas
be
sold.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
--
well,
substantially
yes.
there
is
one
purpose
i
think
for
which
a
rate
would
have
to
be
fixed,
and
that
is
caused
by
the
temporary
certificates.
during
the
pendency
of
these
proceedings,
the
commission
permitted
the
sales
to
be
made
at
prices,
which
we
believe
and
we
think
the
commission
believes,
are
excessive.
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
what
was
the
appropriate
rate
during
that
period
for
purposes
of
making
refunds.
but
other
than
that
and
had
there
been
no
temporaries,
there
would
be
no
need
to
go
to
the
in-line
question
at
all.
and
that
would
terminate
it
if
there's
no
need.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
on
the
other
hand,
much
of
the
problems
of
the
commission
gets
into
is
because,
it
issues
the
temporary
so
readily.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
emergency
to
justify
a
temporary.
the
commission
issues
temporaries
as
a
routine
matter,
and
i
will
address
myself
to
this
point
right
here
even
though
it's
slightly
out
of
order.
there
is
no
hearing.
application
for
temporary
can
be
a
one
or
two-page
sheet.
it
is
responded
to
by
a
letter.
the
commission
issues
temporaries
as
a
matter
of
routine.
every
applicant
gets
one
that
there
they
have
it.
now,
i
don't
think
the
temporaries
wherever
intended
to
be
issued
on
that
kind
of
basis,
i
don't
think
then
that
the
most
generous
concept
of
emergency
and
this
is
an
emergency
power.
it
has
granted
the
ex
parte
at
the
time
when
the
consumer
who
will
be
called
on
to
pay
these
charges
on
others
is
absent
from
the
proceeding.
i
don't
see
how
an
emergency
power
can
be
expanded
to
cover
routine
everyday
application.
but
if
there
were
an
emergency,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
the
type
of
finding
of
need
that
i'm
talking
about
at
that
time.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
logically
that
if
there's
no
public
need,
the
commission
has
no
business
issuing
a
temporary
certificate.
i
would
think
that
the
real
emergency
situation
is
one
where
the
public
is
about
to
go
out
of
gas
and
something
has
to
be
done
pretty
quick,
and
you
don't
have
time
for
a
hearing.
so
you
issue
a
temporary
certificate.
the
commission
issues
a
temporary
certificate
because
it
takes
it
a
while
to
get
around
to
deciding
it
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing.
i
don't
really
think
that's
an
emergency
situation.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
not
at
all.
no.
could
there
be
an
emergency
from
the
point
of
view,
yes.
i
think
that
that
might
be
a
possible
legitimate
interest.
but
i
would
like
to
run
through
very
briefly
the
grounds
for
an
emergency
certificate.
their
drainage,
drainage
means
you
have
two
wells
adjacent
to
each
other.
one
is
being
produced
and
the
gas
from
the
second
one
is
migrating
below
the
first
one.
in
the
sunray
temporary
certificate
that
mr.
coleman
read
to
you
yesterday,
the
allegation
was,
that
the
adjacent
well
had
been
contracted
to
be
sold
to
tennessee
gas
pipeline
and
was
being
sold.
and
sunray
wanted
to
get
a
temporary
to
sell
to
tennessee.
now,
there
was
no
public
interest
here
at
all
because
all
of
the
gas
would
go
to
tennessee
gas
pipeline
and
its
customers.
and
it
would
simply
--
whether
it
would
go
through
the
sunray
well
or
the
adjacent
well.
there
is
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct.
however,
since
you
--
the
statute
says
you
can't
make
a
sale
until
you
get
a
certificate.
the
statute
says
there
is
a
hearing.
now,
the
delay
between
the
time
you
filed
an
application
on
the
hearing
which
is
statutorily
created,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
create
an
emergency
right.
there
is
--
flaring
of
a
gas
is
a
basis.
flaring
occurs
when
you
have
gas
being
produced
from
a
well
that
produces
both
oil
and
gas.
the
producer
decides
he
wants
to
produce
it
in
order
to
derive
revenues
from
the
oil.
he
has
no
outlet
for
his
gas
so
it
is
simply
burned
off
in
effect.
the
states
can
control
flaring.
but
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
produce
is
a
decision
made
by
the
producer
to
derive
the
oil
revenues.
there
is
loss
of
lease.
some
of
the
leases
that
the
producers
have
with
their
lessors
provide
that
the
lease
shall
be
on
production
within
a
certain
time.
this
is
a
private
contract
condition.
then
there
is
the
broad
catch-all
category
which
i
think
explains
the
other
three,
it
renders,
the
other
three
really
mandatory.
and
that
is
an
economic
hardship.
and
the
commission
has
accepted
as
a
definition
of
economic
hardship
and
this
is
the
basis
of
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
temporary
applications.
the
loss
of
revenue
that
occurs
to
the
producer
during
the
time
he
is
waiting
for
permanent
certificate.
therefore
every
time
you
file
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate,
you
have,
under
the
commission's
regulation,
created
a
basis
for
an
emergency
because
you
will
have
to
wait
sometime
until
the
hearing
can
be
held.
it's
a
peculiar
concept
to
the
emergency,
i
think.
it's
an
unparalleled
one.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes,
it
always
makes
that
finding
in
the
statutory
line
of
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
right.
you
can't
say
we've
satisfied
the
statute
unless
you
make
the
findings
that
really
would
(voice
overlap)
mr.
morton
l.
simon
pardon?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
until
--
do
you
mean
until
the
pipeline
begins
taking
that
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that's
correct
but
the
pipeline
can
take
it
under
temporary
ser
--
there
was
a
case
in
louisiana.
tennessee
gas
transmission
cp
60-57
was
filed
in
1960.
we
intervened.
it
was
to
take
some
offshore
gas.
the
commission
granted
a
temporary
in
1961.
in
the
meantime,
the
producer
sales
were
certificated.
in
1964,
the
commission
noticed
it
again
and
said,
“does
anybody
still
object
to
this?”
and
we
said,
“yes
we
do.”
because
tennessee
is
in
a
take-or-pay
situation
and
we
want
to
examine
it.
and
i
said
“oh!”
and
i
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
and
that's
where
it's
been.
so
it's
not
that
easy
to
get
a
hearing
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
give
you
a
hearing,
and
the
commission
really
doesn't.
that
tennessee
line
has
been
going
for
seven
years
under
a
temporary
certificate.
there
has
never
been
a
finding
as
we've
been
ready
from
the
date
the
notice
was
filed.
to
go
to
hearing
on
whether
there
was
a
need.
and
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
essentially
there
are
two
aspects
of
need.
one
is,
is
there
a
public
need
for
this
gas?
does
the
public
needed
to
receive
gas
service
or
does
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well
yes,
sales
being
made
to
the
consumer,
through
the
distributor,
and
through
the
pipeline.
now,
if
the
public
can
be
adequately
served
without
the
addition
of
this
gas,
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
this
gas.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
this
particular
gas.
if
the
public
can
be
served
without
the
addition
of
this
gas
then
there
is
no
public
need.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
if
perhaps
this
pipeline
could
sell
it,
i
want
to
go
into
this
take-or-pay
problem
because
it
illuminates
i
think
the
whole
problem
of
need.
in
other
words
if
the
pipeline
is
selling
say
800,000
mcf
a
day,
that's
its
market
demand.
and
if
they
presently
has
contracts
that
give
it
800,000
a
day,
and
then
it
goes
up
and
buys
another
100,000
a
day,
is
there
a
need
for
the
other
100,000?
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
it?
now,
what
has
happened
is
the
contracts
have
minimum
take
provisions.
these
are
20-year
contracts
and
they
provide
for
takeover
the
life
normally
based
on
an
evaluation
of
the
reserves.
they
contained
minimum
provisions.
you
take
so
much
depending
on
the
reserves.
you
take
10,000
mcf
a
day
and
if
you
don't
take
it,
you
will
pay
for
it
anyway.
now,
what
has
happened
and
this
is
why
we
started
to
raise
the
need
issue.
we
found
that
the
pipelines
were
getting
in
situations
increasingly
where
they
were
paying
for
gas
that
they
could
not
physically
put
through
their
system.
they
had
cut
all
of
their
contracts
down
to
the
minimum
take
provision
that
it
provided.
and
not
withstanding
that,
they
were
paying
for
gas
they
couldn't
take
and
accruing
huge
balances.
united
gas
pipeline
paid
$22
million
for
gas
that
it
physically
could
not
put
through
its
system.
and
united
was
one
of
the
purchasers
in
the
cases
that
are
before
this
court.
it
came
to
the
commission
on
a
rate
case.
now
it
says,
“we
want
to
capitalize
it,
include
it
in
our
rate
base,
increase
rates
over
what
they
would
otherwise
be
to
reflect
this
$22
million
for
gas
that
we've
paid
for
but
couldn't
take.”
the
new
york
commission
objected
to
that.
and
the
commission
said,
“well,
that's
alright.
we'll
let
united
include
in
its
rate
base.”
there
are
other
problems
because
once
this
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
in
the
orders
here
under
review?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
no
findings
at
all.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
certainly
is,
mr.
justice
black.
it
certainly
is.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct
and
the
consumer
will
be
taxed
for
it.
that
is
the
heart
of
it,
yes
sir.
there
are
other
aspects
of
take-or-pay.
what
happens
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
it
should.
i
think
that
that
was
the
way
the
act
was
written
that
in
the
certificate
case,
you
do
not
permit
improper
charges
to
become
embedded
in
the
pipelines
cost.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
would
depend
on
how
minor.
but
i
think
that's
right.
it's
trivial
and
certainly
not.
the
problem
that
we
have
found
is
that
this
situation
has
become
very
widespread
throughout
the
industry.
mr.
schiff
said
yesterday
that
the
commission
found
that
it
was
decreasing.
that's
just
not
so.
we
quote
from
there
in
1955
and
1960
--
the
commissions
1955
and
1966
annual
reports
to
congress.
in
those
reports,
the
commission
shows
that
the
take-or-pay
balances
was
increasing
and
something
like
65
million
to
85
million.
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
our
reply
brief
where
that
is
cited.
it
was
called
to
my
attention
that
although
the
commission
has
to
come
up
with
its
1967
annual
report
is
yet
the
same
figure
is
available
in
another
commission
publications
statistics
of
natural
gas
pipelines.
and
that
at
the
latest
figure
as
of
the
end
of
1966
has
risen
another
10%
to
some
$95
million
or
prepayments.
the
situation
is
getting
--
these
problems
don't
go
away.
they
don't
go
away
because
the
commission
refuses
to
look
at
it.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
they
closed
that
out.
it
was
a
--
it
might
have
been
a
good
proceeding.
one
of
the
problems
with
this,
it
was
a
rule-making
proceeding.
it
was
instituted
in
1961
when
the
commission
first
became
aware
of
these
problems.
now,
what
their
proposed
rule
would
have
done,
mr.
justice
white,
was
essentially
two
things.
it
would
have
limited
the
type
of
minimum
take
provision
that
could
be
put
in
any
contract.
and
the
effect
of
this
would
have
been
that
pipelines
would
have
not
have
gotten
into
take-or-pay
situations.
the
second
thing
it
would
do
is
provide
a
longer
period
for
them
to
make
up
the
gas
once
they
got
in
a
take-or-pay
situation.
the
commission
let
this
sit
for
some
six
years
until
the
eve
of
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
then
they
came
out
with
their
rule
and
the
rule
does
nothing
about
the
type
of
minimum
take
provision
that
can
be
put
in
a
contract.
it
does
nothing
to
alleviate
or
to
prevent
the
pipeline
from
getting
into
a
minimum
take
--
into
a
take-or-pay
provision.
all
it
did
was
say,
that
they
shall
have
five
years
to
make
up
any
prepayments
that
they
have
made.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
would
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
when
you
make
that
kind
of
a
contract,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
your
judgment
is
affected
by
whose
going
to
pay
for
it.
and
i
think
if
you're
not
going
to
pay
for
it
certainly
it's
desirable
to
go
out
and
preempt
as
much
gas
as
you
can.
don't
let
your
competitor
get
it,
don't
let
any
pipeline
get
it,
i
suppose
that
if
a
pipeline
could
tie
up
all
of
the
gas
that
there
is
in
southern
louisiana
and
the
texas
gulf
coast
and
if
there
would
be
assured
that
its
cost
in
doing
so
would
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer,
it
would
like
to
do
it
whether
it
needed
it
or
not.
it
would
then
be
assured
of
every
market
there
is.
this
goes
to
one
of
the
conservation
issues
too
because
what
has
happened
here
because
the
commission
does
that
considered
need
is,
it
leads
to
wasteful
and
preemptive
buying.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
contracts.
that
enters
into
a
contract,
sales
contract.
that
sales
contract
comes
before
the
commission
in
the
producers
certificate
case
which
is
what
we
have
right
here.
now,
there
are
other
aspects
as
there
are
other
injuries
that
are
caused
by
take-or-pay
problems.
i
just
want
to
mention
one
of
them
and
that
is
this.
the
take-or-pay
problems
became
more
onerous,
more
observable
in
the
late,
very
late
50s
perhaps
and
early
60s.
and
the
earlier
contracts
did
not
have
either
this
kind
of
take-or-pay
provisions
or
strict
take-or-pay
provisions.
what
the
pipelines
first
started
to
do
therefore,
was
to
cut
back
on
their
older
contracts,
cut
back
the
takes
under
the
older
contracts
which
did
not
have
a
minimum
take
requirement.
so
they
might
have
two
contracts,
one
calling
for
the
purchase
of
gas
of
20
cents
recently
contracted.
the
other
calling
for
the
purchase
of
gas
at
9
cents
contracted
say
10
or
15
years
ago.
they're
entitled
under
their
9-cent
contract
say
to
take
10,000
mcf
a
day,
but
they
can
take
no
gas
without
any
penalty.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
because
it's
the
producer
--
it
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
because
it's
the
producer
that's
asking
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
in
reality,
the
one
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
the
pipeline
is
the
purchaser
in
the
producer
hearing.
i
suppose
in
any
type
of
proceeding
where
an
applicant
is
seeking
a
certificate,
it
is
the
applicant
who
shows
his
market
although
his
market
is
composed
of
people
who
are
not
himself.
i
suppose
that
a
tracker
who
is
seeking
a
certificate
should
bring
in
shippers
to
show
that
the
shippers
have
a
need
for
the
service
proposed.
certainly,
in
the
pipeline
cases,
the
pipeline
proves
its
market
by
bringing
in
its
customers.
it
will
bring
in
the
distributing
companies
who
will
testify
as
to
what
their
needs
for
the
gas
will
be.
and
this
--
the
commission
has
suggested
that
it's
a
difficult
administrative
problem
and
it's
backed
off
and
said
really
it
isn't.
but
we
had
in
these
proceedings
a
total
of
five
pipeline
purchasers.
all
that
would
have
been
required
was
to
bring
a
witness
from
each
of
the
five
to
explain
what
their
present
sales
are,
what
their
present
minimum
and
maximum
entitlements
to
are
under
their
existing
contracts.
it's
not
that
difficult
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
simply
to
grant
some
authority
to
make
the
sale
as
filed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
i
would
like
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
each
pipeline?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
where
the
matter
is
raised.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
whether
it
needed
this
additional
gas
in
order
to
satisfy
its
market,
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
don't
think
so.
it
isn't
that
much
of
a
pipe
--
a
pipeline
will
bring
in
some
40
or
50
customers
in
each
proceeding
to
show
its
market.
i
do
want
to
move
on
to
the
in-line
issue.
i've
spent
more
on
need
that
i
had
intended.
now,
on
the
in-line,
and
the
in-line
doctrine
comes
from
this
court's
catco
decision
which
said
that
in
certificating
new
sales,
the
commission
must
protect
the
consumer
against
excessive
rates
and
charges
by
denying
sales
that
are
out
of
line.
it
is
from
this
concept
that
the
in-line
and
the
hold
of
the
line
language
has
come.
now
what
the
commission
did
here,
we're
talking
about
the
texas
gulf
coast.
there
are
a
series
of
events.
in
september
1960,
the
commission
established
guidelines
in
each
of
the
three
areas
at
18
cents
per
mcf.
there
is
not
the
slightest
question
in
the
world
that
that
did
not
conform
to
this
court's
catco
requirement.
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
would
so
argue.
18
cents
was
out
of
line.
the
commission
subsequently
found
for
each
of
the
three
areas
that
on
september
28,
1960
when
it
promulgated
its
guidelines,
the
in-line
prices
in
the
three
areas
were
15
cents
in
districts
4
and
2,
and
16
cents
in
district
3.
indeed,
those
in-line
determinations
subsequently
in
1962
and
1963
had
found
15
cents
was
in-line
in
district
4
and
2,
and
16
cents
was
in-line
in
district
3.
it
amended
its
guideline
levels
at
that
time.
instead
of
amending
its
guideline
levels
to
the
in-line
level
that
had
just
found
as
two
of
the
five
commissioners
urged,
it
fixed
the
guideline
level
one
cent
above
the
in-line
level
that
had
just
found
16
cents
in
districts
4
and
2,
17
cents
in
district
3.
it
then
sets
the
instant
cases
that
we
have
here
for
hearing.
after
hearing,
the
commission
found
that
wonderful
to
relate
the
in-line
level
for
the
period
after
the
policy
statement
was
the
elevated
by
one
cent
guideline
levels
that
it
had
fixed
at
the
outset
of
these
hearings.
now,
a
difference
of
one
cent
per
mcf,
while
it
sounds
small,
when
we
apply
it
to
the
industry
as
a
whole
amounts
to
enormous
sums
of
money.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
they
are
not
that
large
but
then
the
chairman
of
the
commission
has
pointed
out
that
if
you
applied
one
cent
across
the
board
to
all
natural
gas
sales,
you're
talking
about
a
$150
million
a
year.
if
you
apply
it
to
all
of
the
estimated
known
reserves
in
the
ground,
you're
talking
about
$2.5
billion.
now,
the
purpose
of
finding
an
in-line
level,
we
submit,
was
to
protect
the
consumer.
the
way
this
works
is,
once
the
in-line
level
is
found
that
is
the
initial
price
the
producer
can
charge,
he
can
file
up
under
section
4
for
an
increase,
but
if
he
can't
justify
the
increase,
he
has
to
make
refunds.
the
evil
of
a
high
in-line
prices
that
there
is
no
way
to
catch
by
refunds
or
otherwise,
the
excess
in
the
event
that
it
should
be
determined
that
that
in-line
price
is
higher
than
the
subsequent
just
and
reasonable
rate.
we
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
in-line
pricing
as
you
start
with
catco
is
to
find
the
line
and
then
hold
it.
now,
the
commission
talks
about,
it
has
to
go
to
current
conditions
and
contemporaneous
conditions.
first
of
all,
there's
nothing
in
the
cases
that
suggests
that
you
have
to
go
to
contracts
which
is
what
the
commission
did.
the
commission
limited
its
view
here
to
contracts
entered
into
in
amerada
for
example
between
1960
and
1962.
but
during
this
times
span,
there
were
enormous
volumes
of
gas
being
sold
under
contracts
dated
prior
thereto.
the
commission
ignored
all
of
those
prices,
fixed
itself
only
on
the
contracts
entered
into
between
1960
and
'62.
those
contracts
had
been
entered
into
at
high
prices.
we
had
intervened
on
the
applications
to
make
those
sales.
the
commission
says
because
we
intervened,
there
are
no
permanently
certificated
prices.
we
will
therefore
look
at
the
prices
we
have
temporarily
certificated.
in
fact,
we
looked
at
the
very
prices
that
are
before
us.
the
commission
in
writing
at
its
16-cent
guideline,
it
relied
on
38
contracts.
36
of
those
contracts
were
the
contracts
at
issue
in
the
amerada
preceding
where
we
were
holding
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
in-line
level
should
be.
the
commission
said,
well
we
will
grant
certification
on
the
basis
of
the
temporary
certificates
we've
issued.
as
noted,
these
temporary
certificates
are
issued
on
an
ex
parte
basis.
they
are
not
reviewable.
when
this
whole
business
started
out
at
the
time
of
skelly,
and
the
commission
first
said
that
it
would
not
make
refunds,
we
appealed
the
skelly
decision
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
at
the
same
time,
we
appealed
some
temporary
certificates
which
had
just
been
issued
which
were
issued
in
our
view
at
out
of
line
prices.
the
two
appeals
as
mcdermott
and
skelly
were
heard
before
the
same
panel
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
at
the
same
time
within
a
couple
of
weeks.
they
were
decided
within
a
couple
of
weeks
of
each
other.
both
opinions
were
written
by
judge
fahy.
and
in
essence,
what
he
said
was,
we
cannot
make
a
determination
on
a
temporary
certificate
whether
it's
right
or
wrong.
these
matters
are
not
foreclosed
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
however,
in
skelly
he
said,
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
the
commission
has
to
go
back
and
do
what
is
right,
make
it
right
from
the
beginning.
we
think
that's
right.
if
the
commission
doesn't
have
the
power
to
make
it
right
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
then
we
think
that
the
temporary
certificate
is
wrong,
right
from
its
inception
because
it
would
then
be
violating
catco.
and
of
course
this
goes
to
a
question
that
you
asked
mr.
justice
white
yesterday.
it
was
answered
by
mr.
coleman
and
i
want
to
support
his
answer.
could
the
commission
say
in
a
temporary
certificate,
“we're
giving
you
a
temporary
certificate
at
18
cents
or
20
cents
or
any
price
and
we're
not
going
to
make
you
give
anything
back
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
no
matter
what”?
could
it
do
that?
no.
we
don't
think
legally
it
has
the
power
to
give
that
kind
of
money
away
to
be
that
generous.
catco
said
you
have
to
provide
a
complete
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection.
and
what
was
involved
in
catco
was
the
excessive
initial
price
between
the
time
of
certification
and
the
time
you
would
catch
up
to
the
excess
in
a
section
5
proceeding.
but
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
excess
price
in
the
temporary
certificate
and
the
time
you
catch
up
with
it
on
permanent
certification.
there
is
no
gap
in
the
act.
this
court
has
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
pardon?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
you
do.
i
think
you
should.
and
i
think
that
what
you
should
say
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
right.
now,
we
filed
that
request.
at
the
--
the
commission
had
just
held
in
skelly
that
at
the
end
of
the
preceding,
it
wouldn't
order
refunds.
and
the
amerada
preceding
was
pending.
we
said
“alright,
if
you
don't
think
it's
fair
at
the
end,
you've
got
all
of
this
outstanding
at
16,
17,
18
cents.
we're
litigating.
we're
saying
that
15
is
the
highest.
that
at
least
put
in
a
condition
now
if
you
don't
think
it's
fair.”
we
said
this
is
without
prejudice
to
the
appeals
we're
taking
in
mcdermott
that
you
have
no
right
at
the
outset
to
do
it.
it's
without
prejudice
to
the
appeal
we're
taking
in
skelly
that
you
can
make
refunds
at
the
end.
and
the
commission
said,
“oh!
well
we
won't
do
it
here
either.”
we
didn't
appeal
that.
i
agree
that
left
us
with
our
skelly
remedy,
but
we
won
skelly.
the
commission
has
recognized
that
and
that
has
changed
the
law.
there
are
certain
of
the
comments
that
were
made
by
mr.
schiff.
i
can't
get
to
them
all.
i
do
want
to
get
to
one.
he
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
in-line
pricing
was
to
prevent
rate
increase
filings.
now,
that
is
just
dead
wrong.
you
can't
find
it
anywhere
in
the
opinions,
and
in
fact
it's
illogical.
if
an
applicant
comes
in
for
an
18-cent
price,
if
you'll
allow
him
his
18-cent
price,
and
that's
all
he
has
the
contract
for,
obviously,
he
can't
file
up
under
this
court's
mobile
doctrine.
if
you
cut
him
back
and
that's
what
catco
was
talking
about,
cutting
back
to
the
in-line
level,
certainly,
he
then
has
a
contract
right
to
file
up.
but
it
seems
a
very
strange
thing
to
say
that
you're
preventing
a
rate
increase
filing
by
giving
the
producer
everything
that
he
would
get
out
of
a
rating
for
his
filing
right
at
the
outset.
i
have
--
i'm
afraid
i
spent
more
time
than
i
intended
on
need
issue
and
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
tell
during
his
presentation
stated
that
in
the
prior
cases,
the
commission
had
found
15
cents
as
the
in-line
level
for
the
1950s
and
that
the
question
before
the
commission
in
this
proceedings
was
to
determine
whether
there
were
changed
circumstances
which
would
justify
a
change
in
the
in-line
price.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
his
statement
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
prior
in-line
finding
is
not
an
in-line
finding
for
the
50s.
in
skelly,
for
the
example,
the
commission
had
before
basically
nine
contracts
executed
in
1959
and
1960.
and
it
predicated
its
finding
on
the
conditions
that
existed
from
1958
through
1960.
in
the
amerada
case,
we
had
contracts
for
the
two-year
period
beginning
immediately
after
skelly
from
september
1960
through
august
1962.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
is,
what
were
the
changed
circumstances
that
the
commission
relied
on
to
elevate
its
in-line
level
by
a
penny.
the
changed
circumstances
were
essentially
the
higher
prices
negotiated
in
the
marketplace.
and
i
think
that
this
brings
us
not
only
to
the
whole
suspect
line
doctrine
but
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
phrased
by
judge
bazelon
below.
he
said
the
need
for
the
fpc
and
for
a
concept
like
in-line
prices
arises
primarily
because
the
unregulated
marketplace
cannot
protect
the
consumer
adequately.
congress
created
the
fpc
to
protect
the
consumer
from
the
marketplace,
not
simply
to
reflect
it.
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
marketplace
was
leading
to
higher
prices
of
pipelines
and
producers
who
are
willing
to
negotiate
for
higher
prices
in
the
60s
than
they
were
in
1959
and
1960.
this
fact,
far
from
contradicting
a
need
for
holding
the
line
for
fpc
control
merely
emphasizes
it.
now,
the
commission
attempts
to
say,
“well,
we
aren't
relying
on
the
naked
marketplace
as
we
did
in
the
catco
case
which
led
to
this
court's
reversal.
we're
relying
on
the
fact
that
we
have
issued
temporary
certificates.
but
the
prices
contained
the
temporary
certificates
are
not
approved.
they
are
not
final.
they
are
subject
to
revision,
happy
outcome
of
the
hearing
on
those
temporary
certificates.
that
price
is
the
price
that
obtains
only
during
the
pendency
of
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
should
be
permanently
certificated.
and
indeed
once
it's
permanently
certificated,
it
can
be
replaced
by
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
at
a
later
time.
but
it's
for
this
reason
that
no
reliance
can
be
placed
on
temporary
--
temporarily
certificated
prices.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
certificating
an
in-line
level
of
15
cents
and
an
in-line
level
of
16
cents?
it
is
just
this,
under
both
circumstances,
the
producer
can
file
it
up
to
its
contract
level,
be
it
16,
17,
18
cents,
or
whatever.
however,
if
the
ultimate
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
determined
in
the
area
rate
proceedings,
turns
out
to
be
lower
than
16
cents,
if
the
in-line
--
the
difference
between
15
and
16
cannot
be
recouped
unless
the
in-line
level
has
been
fixed
at
15.
it's
possible
that
the
just
and
reasonable
level
could
be
even
lower
than
15
cents.
in
that
case,
the
consumer
is
just
disadvantaged
without
any
recourse
at
all.
but
the
fact
is
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
there
are
no
conditions,
no
conditions
are
put
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
no
sir.
there
are
none
in
any
others
that
i
know
of.
the
permanent
condition
--
the
conditions
that's
put
in
is
to
certificate
at
an
in-line
level
which
is
the
initial
certificating
level.
that's
what
you
can
charge
until
you
change
it
under
section
4.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
there
are
no
refunds
if
you
don't
change
it.
that's
right.
there
is
no
way
to
touch
that
at
all.
that's
firm
and
fixed.
now,
the
basis
for
the
determination
--
oh,
incidentally
i
would
say
that
the
commission
never
made
any
finding
that
there
was
less
need
for
consumer
protection
with
respect
to
these
contracts
which
have
the
16-cent
level
than
it
had
for
the
contracts
in
skelly
which
had
a
15-cent
level.
there
was
in
all
three
of
these
cases
a
diminution
in
the
degree
of
consumer
protection
over
the
prior
series
of
cases
without
any
finding
by
the
commission
that
such
diminution
was
proper
or
was
required.
now,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
in-line
price?
in
each
of
these
proceedings,
i
want
to
run
through
it
very
briefly.
in
amerada,
i
understand
this
morning
that
i
said
that
of
the
38
contracts
relied
on
for
guideline
level,
and
i
should
have
said
for
in-line
level
purposes
here,
36
of
the
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
don't
know
of
any
that
they
have
ever
done
that
way,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
didn't
say
that.
i
don't
know
whether
they
do.
let
me
say
that.
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
arisen.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that's
right.
there
is
no
reparation.
now,
if
they
put
in
a
specific
condition
for
that,
i
don't
know.
we're
talking
about
two
different
situations.
if
the
certificate
let's
say,
at
15
cents,
and
the
in-line
price
turns
out
to
be
14
later,
there
is
no
power
to
get
reparation
on
the
difference
between
15
and
14.
if
they
can
issue
a
certificate
conditioned
at
15
and
said
further
more,
anything
we
later
find
in
an
area
rate
proceeding
to
be
unjust
and
reasonable
shall
be
refunded.
then
you
would
have
the
propriety
of
that
kind
of
a
condition.
the
commissioner
has
never
imposed
that
kind
of
a
condition
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
about
imposing
a
condition
that's
not
in
this
case?
yes.
i
would
hesitate
to
say.
i'm
a
great
believer.
i'm
leaving
it
to
the
litigation
lending
their
eyes
with
this.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct.
i
thought
mr.
justice
brennan
was
asking
me
about
a
situation
not
present
in
callery,
not
present
in
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes,
certainly.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes.
since
you
have
mentioned
callery,
i
would
like
to
turn
right
to
that.
at
this
point,
in
callery,
this
court
twice
mentioned
what
the
standard
is
for
fixing
in-line
price.
it
said
at
382
u.s.
227,
consumer
protection
is
afforded
by
keeping
the
in-line
price
--
by
keeping
the
in-line
price
at
the
level
where
substantial
amounts
of
gas
have
been
certificated
to
enter
the
market
under
contemporaneous
certificates
no
longer
subject
to
judicial
review
or
in
any
way
suspect.
now,
there's
no
question
here
that
the
commission
use
suspect
prices.
again
the
court
said
at
page
229,
the
in-line
price
of
18.5
cents
is
supported
by
the
contract
prices
in
the
south
louisiana
area
that
were
not
suspect.
again
there's
not
question
that
the
temporarily
certificated
prices
and
the
contract
prices,
that
the
commission
relied
on
in
this
case,
the
elevated
in-line
level
and
thereby
reduced
the
amount
of
consumer
protection
were
suspect.
i
said
in
amerada
that
36
of
the
38
contracts
which
have
been
temporarily
certificated
and
were
relied
on
for
the
guideline
level
were
the
very
--
to
fix
the
in-line
level,
were
the
very
contracts
before
the
commission
itself.
in
sinclair,
the
commission
referred
to
the
fact
and
they
said
this
out
on
page
33
of
their
brief.
they
were
impressed
by
the
fact
that
40%
of
the
total
volume
was
moving
at
18
cents.
that
40%
was
all
under
temporary
certificates.
three
quarters
of
that
40%
were
sales
to
lone
star
gathering
company
which
as
i
discussed
this
morning
under
the
need
issue,
it
was
subsequently
determined.
there
was
no
need
for
it.
the
certificates
were
vacated.
that
75%
of
the
40%,
three
quarters
of
the
40%,
those
sales
are
no
longer
being
made
in
interstate
commerce.
yet,
that's
what
the
commission
relied
on.
they
relied
on
sales
that
are
no
longer
being
made
in
interstate
commerce.
that
fact
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
would
require
vacation
of
the
commissions
finding
that
the
in-line
level
is
16
cents.
i
would
point
out
too
that
those
were
all
contracts
that
were
before
the
commission
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
in-line
price
for
permanent
certification.
in
the
hawkins
case,
the
commission
seems
to
have
shifted
its
basis
for
getting
the
price
of
a
penny.
and
it
says
that
its
primary
reliance
was
on
three
permanently
certificated
18-cent
prices.
those
three
18-cent
prices,
i
don't
want
to
go
into
all
of
it,
but
those
three
prices
were
deemed
suspect
by
the
examiner,
by
the
commission
staff,
by
the
two
dissenters,
and
we
set
out
the
reasons
in
volume
3
of
the
appendix
of
pages
312,
313,
why
those
were
suspect.
the
commission
never
addressed
itself
to
a
discussion
of
whether
or
not
they
were
in
fact
suspect.
but
we
think
clearly
under
the
prior
court
decisions,
they
were.
now,
the
commission
says,
it
attempts
to
get
around
this
business
of
the
fact
the
prices
were
suspect
by
saying,
well
we
gave
discounted
weight,
we
didn't
give
full
weight
to
it.
but
the
problem
with
giving
weight
anyway
to
suspect
prices
is
the
suspect
prices
are
probative
nothing
at
all
of
no
factor
that
is
relevant
in
an
in-line
determination.
and
you
don't
cure
the
defect
of
giving
weight
to
inadmissible
evidence
that
has
no
probative
value
by
saying,
you
gave
discounted
weight.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
discounted
weight
was
crucial.
the
commission
itself
said
in
sinclair
that
if
we
didn't
give
any
weight,
we
would
have
arrived
at
a
lower
level.
and
so
you
had
an
inadmissible
confession
and
you
had
no
other
evidence
so
you
needed
some
evidence,
so
you
let
it
in
because
it
provided
that
the
term
would
be
reduced
by
one-half
or
one-fourth.
if
it's
inadmissible,
it's
inadmissible.
if
it's
not
probative,
it's
not
probative.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
get
into
a
tyranny
of
lack
of
standards
and
vague
standards.
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
let's
see
what
the
commission
itself
said.
at
page
33
of
its
brief
it
says,
it's
speaking
here
of
the
sinclair
case.
it
says,
“no
doubt
on
this
evidence,
the
court
examining
the
matter
de
novo
might
choose
a
different
price
line.
there
is
room
for
arguing
that
the
price
line
should
be
15
cents
or
15.5
cents
or
even
as
high
as
18
cents.
but
in
the
final
analysis,
the
statute
commits
the
decision
to
the
expert
judgment
of
the
commission.
now,
as
i
understand
that
they're
saying
based
on
the
evidentiary
record
before
that
they
could
have
come
up
with
anything
between
15
and
18
cents.
and
i
submit
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
that
kind
of
standard
is
just
too
vague.
it
has
no
meaning.
if
that's
what
it
is,
then
the
hearing
that
we
had,
we
might
just
as
well
have
forgotten
it.
if
that,
there
is
that
much
range
for
the
commission
to
pick
an
in-line
level,
then
i
think
that
the
in-line
determination
and
the
protection
that
this
court
intended
in
catco,
have
been
a
terrible
waste
of
time.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
certain
statements
made
by
mr.
caskin
with
respect
to
the
policy
statement.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
possible
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
to
take
an
appeal
from
the
policy
statement
when
it
was
issued.
it
was
issued
without
notice,
without
hearing,
without
record.
the
state
of
wisconsin
representing
the
consumer
interest,
filed
an
application
for
rehearing
which
is
a
prerequisite
for
review.
the
commission
rejected
that
application.
the
state
of
wisconsin
took
an
appeal
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
that
commission
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
policy
statement
fixes
no
rights.
it
fixes
no
procedures.
when
it
is
applied,
that
is
the
time
to
approach
it
when
it
is
implemented.
i
would
point
out
too
that
in
june
of
1962,
the
new
york
commission
filed
the
petition
to
amend
the
policy
statement.
that
petition
has
been
pending
for
six
years.
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
get
any
action
on
it.
when
the
commission
did
implement
the
policy
statement
in
a
case
like
mcdermott,
we
did
appeal.
the
dc
circuit
said,
“we
don't
have
a
full
record.”
these
matters
can
all
be
worked
out.
we
did
attack
specifically
in
the
mcdermott
appeal,
the
failure
to
include
and
express
refund
condition,
we
attack
the
fact
that
the
price
was
out
of
line
in
the
temporary.
the
dc
circuit
said,
“these
matters,
we
don't
have
a
full
record
before
as
these
matters
can
all
be
determined
on
permanent
certification.
that
is
the
time
to
obtain
it.”
now,
mr.
johnson
has
suggested
that
the
distributor
companies
are
here
before
you
because
they
will
retain
a
large
amount
of
money
if
they
can
and
that
it's
purely
a
selfish
interest.
first
of
all,
a
statement
would
not
apply
in
any
event
to
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
not
a
distributor.
with
respect
to
the
three
distributors
i
represent,
i
like
to
state
that
two
of
them,
brooklyn
union
gas
company,
long
island
lighting
company
have
purchased
gas
adjustment
clauses
in
their
contract,
the
effect
of
which
is
that
any
dollar
that
they
get
back
out
of
this
proceeding
will
flow
right
through
to
their
customers.
they
will
not
retain
it.
with
respect
to
philadelphia
electric
company,
i
had
occasion
to
check
what
they
had
done
with
the
monies
they
have
gotten
back
through
the
end
of
1966.
they
had
received
$4
million
from
their
two
pipeline
suppliers,
part
of
it,
being
producer
refunds
that
the
pipelines
have
passed
on.
and
they
had
refunded
or
flow
through
to
their
customers,
passed
on
to
their
customers
99.6%
of
that.
now,
i
think
that
this
is
a
meretricious
argument.
i
think
if
there's
any
question
at
all,
certainly
the
clients
i
represent
would
have
no
problem
if
this
court
where
to
say
that
the
money
should
flow
through
directly
to
the
consumer.
we
are
here
trying
to
vindicate
the
consumer
interest.
we're
not
trying
to
make
the
money
for
ourselves.
i
would
point
out
too
that
as
to
some
of
the
refunds
that
were
withheld
by
some
distributors,
they
may
well
have
been
used
to
offset
rate
increases.
they
may
well
have
benefited
the
consumer
in
other
ways.
in
any
event,
they
don't
apply
so
far
as
these
refunds
are
concerned
with
respect
to
my
clients.
with
respect
to
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
refund
power,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
amerada,
the
commission
declined
in
its
original
amerada
order,
opinion
422
in
1964,
the
commission
declined
to
take
any
action
on
refunds.
in
our
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
and
in
our
appeal
here,
we
took
the
position
that
the
commission's
failure
to
take
action
was
error,
that
it
was
required
to
act
and
that
it
was
required
that
it
had
the
duty
to
order
refunds.
if
we
are
correct
in
that
contention
which
is
before
this
court,
and
if
this
court
should
find
that
we
are
correct,
then
you
don't
get
into
the
problem
of
the
equities.
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
commission's
subsequent
order
opinion
501,
substantially
moots
our
appeal
on
that
point
if
501
does
satisfy
our
request
on
that
point.
but
our
appeal
right
from
the
beginning
was
that
the
commission
had
the
power
and
the
duty
to
order
refunds
at
the
time
that
it
issued
permanent
certificates.
i
think
that
the
issue
we
have
here
in
these
cases
is
one
of
proper
administrative
standards,
does
the
commission
have
to
explain
in
a
meaningful
way
what
it
did?
does
it
have
to
provide
adequate
protection
for
the
consumer?
we
would
ask
that
you
find
that
the
commission
must
make
a
finding
of
need
before
it
certificates,
that
it
must
hold
the
line
at
the
level
that
it
previously
found
and
not
elevate
it
by
reference
to
temporary
certificates
and
that
refunds
were
required
to
make
the
consumer
hold
for
the
out
of
line
amounts
paid.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
oh!
yes.
i
meant
to
respond
to
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
amerada
proceeding
arose
in
1962.
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
in
a
related
term
(inaudible)
proceedings
came
on
for
hearing
1964.
at
1962
and
through
1962,
we
were
willing
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
a
need
or
at
least
we
were
not
raising
that
issue.
we
were
attempting
to
focus
in
on
the
price
issue.
and
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
either
we
did
not
raise
it
or
in
some
cases,
union
texas
was
another
contemporaneous
case
we
stipulated.
but
we
became
increasingly
aware
between
the
institution
of
the
amerada
proceeding
and
hawkins-sinclair
that
the
pipelines
were
getting
into
increasing
difficulty
that
they
were
having
to
make
dump,
the
low
cost
dump
sales
from
oil
re-fillers
for
example
because
they
had
these
take-or-pay
problems
for
their
use.
and
so
by
1964,
we
concluded
that
we
could
no
longer
stipulate
that
there
was
a
need.
if
--
had
amerada
come
later
we
would
have
raised
it.
had
the
others
come
earlier,
we
probably
wouldn't
have
it
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
these
cases
on
behalf
of
four
clients,
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
a
regulatory
agency
of
that
state,
and
three
public
utilities
serving
in
the
philadelphia,
new
york
area;
philadelphia
electric
company,
brooklyn
union
gas
company,
long
island
lighting
company.
we
appear
in
these
cases
are
representatives
of
the
consumer
interest.
in
these
proceedings
before
the
commission,
the
contest
was
between
the
producers
who
are
regulated
by
the
commission
and
who
were
the
applicants
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
on
the
one
hand
and
ourselves
with
some
general
support
from
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
other.
there
are
three
principal
issues
in
this
case;
their
short
form
is
need,
in-line
and
refund.
on
the
need
issue,
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
can
grant
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
the
producer
applicants
authorizing
them
to
make
their
sales
in
interstate
commerce
without
first
making
a
finding
that
there
is
a
public
need
for
the
gas
proposed
to
be
sold.
on
that
issue
it
was
our
position
that
the
commission
was
required
to
make
a
finding
of
need.
the
commission
held
that
it
was
not.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
decision
by
a
chief
judge
bazelon
agreed
with
us
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
that
issue.
on
the
second
question,
the
so
called
in-line
issue,
the
question
is
at
what
initial
price
should
the
commission
certificate
these
sales
to
be
sold.
in
each
of
the
three
dockets,
the
commission
elevated
the
in-line
price
that
it
had
previously
found
for
each
of
the
three
areas
by
one
cent
per
mcf
to
correspond
with
a
guideline
level
that
it
had
previously
announced.
we
challenged
that
once
in
escalation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
has
affirmed
the
commission's
escalation
in
the
district
4
case
amerada.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
reversed
the
commission's
escalation
in
the
districts
2
and
3
case,
hawkins
and
sinclair.
the
commission,
i
should
add,
decide
at
that
one
against
us
also
as
it
had
decided
the
need
issue.
the
final
issue
in
the
case
is
if
the
sales
are
certificated,
should
the
producers
make
refunds
of
the
amounts
that
they
have
collected
under
temporary
certificates
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation
to
the
extent
that
those
collections
exceed
the
in-line
price
as
finally
determined
by
the
commission
after
hearing.
as
indicated
by
other
counsel
earlier,
the
commission
originally
held
in
a
prior
opinion,
the
skelly
oil
opinion
in
august
of
1962,
that
it
would
not
require
refunds.
we,
along
with
mr.
coleman's
client,
united
gas
improvement
company
appealed
that
decision
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
in
january
'64
held
that
the
commission
could
not
excuse
refunds
merely
because
there
had
been
no
expressed
refund
condition
in
the
temporary,
that
this
court
denied
certiorari
after
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision.
and
up
to
that
time,
the
commission
had
decided
against
us.
after
that
decision,
the
commission
substantially
decided
in
our
favor.
accordingly,
on
these
three
issues
we
are
opposed
to
the
commission
on
need
and
in-line
and
we
in
the
commission
are
now
in
agreement
on
the
third
question,
refund,
although
there
is
a
slight
difference
which
i
will
get
to
when
i
discuss
that
issue.
now,
it
appears
to
us
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
commission
went
wrong
here
is
because
it
overlooked
the
very
basic
elements
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
want
just
for
a
moment
to
go
back
to
the
basics
that
are
involved
in
the
natural
gas
act.
these
are
very
elementary
matters.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
being
so
basic.
but
i
think
that
even
as
expert
a
body
is
the
commission
may
have
jumped
in
a
little
too
late.
may
not
have
gone
back
into
what
the
gas
act
is
all
about.
this
court
has
reminded
that
time
and
time
again,
that
the
natural
gas
act
is
designed
to
protect
the
consumer.
it
is
a
piece
of
consumer
protective
legislation.
that
is
its
purpose.
that
is
its
design.
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
given
to
it
by
this
court.
this
court
has
phrased
that
protection
in
various
ways,
at
various
times
but
it
has
always
been
extremely
consistent.
it
was
to
protect
the
consumer
from
exploitation
of
the
hands
of
natural
gas
companies.
it
was
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
douglas
used
in
the
hope
case
back
in
the
40s.
that
phrase
was
repeated
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
in
the
late
50s
and
the
early
60s.
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
catco
case
which
is
really
the
lead
case
so
far
as
this
whole
area
of
producer
certification
under
section
7
is
concerned,
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
a
complete,
permanent,
and
effective
bond
of
protection
to
the
consumer
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
this
then
is
the
purpose
of
the
act.
and
i
think
that
it
is
interesting
both
in
the
commission's
opinion
to
some
extent
in
its
brief
and
on
argument
yesterday
that
commission
counsel
has
noted
that
the
commission
has
taken
a
middle
ground
between
the
consumer
contentions
and
the
producer
contentions.
now,
that
maybe
a
perfectly
accurate
description
of
what
the
commission
did,
and
i
will
come
to
that
later
too.
but
i
don't
think
that
is
--
it
is
any
sort
of
a
defense
for
the
commission
to
make
of
its
actions
here.
it
is
not
charged
by
statute
with
adopting
a
middle
ground
between
contending
conditions
--
positions.
it
is
charged
with
protecting
the
consumer
and
that
is
an
affirmative
duty.
and
when
it
has
failed
to
discharge
that
duty,
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
found
it
necessary
to
remind
the
commission
of
its
duty
and
to
reverse
the
commission's
action.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
and
i
--
let
me
make
perfectly
clear,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
by
saying
that
we
are
consumer
representatives
does
not
relieve
us
one
iota
of
the
burden
of
making
persuasive
arguments
in
the
statutory
terms
to
you
and
to
persuade
you.
and
i
meant
to
obtain
no
advantage
in
that
sense.
i
merely
wanted
to
indicate
what
our
interest
was.
the
commission
is
certainly
not
bound
to
accept
a
contention
because
we
make
it.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
it's
discharging
its
duty
to
say
that
it
hit
somewhere
in
between
the
two
contentions.
its
obligation
is
to
do
what
the
statute
commands
it
to
do,
not
to
mediate
to
opposing
contentions.
it's
not
a
mediation
board.
it
has
affirmative
duties.
now,
the
section
of
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
is
section
7.
that
came
into
the
act
in
1942.
the
original
act
was
passed
in
'38.
the
original
act
had
--
the
heart
of
the
original
act
if
you
will
was
sections
4
and
5
which
gave
the
commission
control
over
rates.
section
7
came
in
1942.
that
was
the
certificate
section.
and
it
says
in
essence,
that
no
person
may
sell
natural
gas
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
without
first
obtaining
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
commission.
when
an
applicant
seeks
a
certificate,
the
commission
is
charged
by
statute
with
giving
notice
and
providing
for
a
hearing.
the
hearing
is
statutorily
required;
the
commission
has
no
power
or
authority
to
waive
a
hearing
on
a
certificate
application.
if
at
the
hearing,
it
is
found
among
other
things,
that
the
certificate
is
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
i
think
that
required
in
the
context
of
the
need
issue
certainly
is
the
keyword
here.
if
the
sale
proposed
to
be
made
is
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
then
a
certificate
shall
issue.
otherwise,
it
shall
be
denied.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
on
need?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
yes
it
is.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
indeed.
there
are
two
other
aspects
of
the
statute
which
should
be
mentioned.
one
is
the
commission
has
a
conditioning
power
to
cure
a
proposal
that
is
largely
correct
but
partially
incorrect.
the
commission
does
not
have
to
deny
it
in
total.
it
can
condition
its
approval
on
deletion
of
the
unsatisfactory
aspects.
and
it
was
its
conditioning
power
that
led
to
the
in-line
conditioning
concept
in
this
court's
1959
catco
decision.
there
is
another
provision
of
the
act
that
provides
in
cases
of
emergency,
the
commission
may
during
the
pendency
of
a
decision
on
the
application
for
a
certificate,
grant
a
temporary
certificate
without
notice
and
without
hearing.
this
is
an
emergency
power.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that
is
its
contention,
mr.
justice
harlan.
our
problem
essentially
is
this.
in
reading
yesterday
to
you
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
this
is
in
volume
4
of
the
appendix
--
at
appendix
page
266,
mr.
schiff
read,
a
large
part
starting
over
at
265
and
ending
on
to
266.
this
is
judge
bazelon's
decision
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
he
stopped,
however,
prior
to
what
i
think
must
be
agreed
as
the
operative
part
really
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
after
discussing
what
the
court
was
not
deciding
judge
bazelon
states,
“we
decide
only
that
when
a
party
makes
a
non-frivolous
claim
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
public
need
for
the
gas,
the
fpc
must
give
considered
reasons
if
it
decides
otherwise.
its
decision
must
be
made
before”
and
that
word
is
emphasized
in
the
court
below.
“its
decision
must
be
made
before
it
grants
a
permanent
certificate
to
the
producer.”
now,
we
think
that
at
the
time
it
issues
a
certificate,
it
has
to
make
a
finding
of
need.
if
it
has
made
a
finding
of
need
that
is
appropriate
and
applicable
in
some
other
proceeding,
certainly
it
can
refer
to
that.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
our
problem
is
that
it
did
not
purport
to
refer
to
any
other
finding
of
need
that
it
had
made.
that
the
orders
that
it
was
issue
in
contemporaneous
cases
indicated
that
the
pipeline
purchasers
here
involved
were
in
a
severe
take-or-pay
situation
in
which
they
had
contracted
to
pay
for
more
gas
than
they
could
physically
take
into
their
system.
and
i
think
it
is
agreed
that
that
situation
imposes
additional
cost
on
the
pipeline
which
will
eventually
be
born
by
the
consumer.
our
problem
with
a
lot
of
what
the
commission
has
done
is
that,
the
cost
goes
through
the
consumer
that
we
are
being
called
upon
to
pay
for
much
of
the
commission's
action,
and
we
don't
feel
that
its
action
is
appropriate.
now,
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
before
it
issued
its
certificate.
the
thought
that
it
can
consider
it
elsewhere,
if
you
analyze
what
they
say
very
closely,
i
think,
and
i
do
want
to
be
fair
that
the
commission
here.
but
i
think
that
what
you
are
left
with
is,
they're
saying
they
could
examine
it
elsewhere.
they
do
not
really
say
that
it
is
examined
elsewhere
or
that
as
to
these
dockets,
it
has
been
examined
elsewhere.
it's
remarkable
to
me
that
throughout
this
entire
case,
they
have
nowhere
pointed
to
what
other
orders
they
were
talking
about.
where
they
decided
that
there
was
some
need,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
say
in
august
1963,
in
such
and
such
an
order
we
considered
this
problem,
we're
relying
on
that.
there
has
never
been
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
they
could
in
the
pipeline
hearing
surely,
no
question.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
oh,
it's
too
late
i
--
i
think.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
legally
and
practically.
i
suppose
physically
it's
not.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
what
the
commi
--
i
think
that
there
is
a
human
tendency
to
ratify
what
you
have
done.
and
i
think
that
if
you
have
already
certificated
producers
to
sell
100,000
mcf
a
day
to
a
pipeline
and
they
are
selling
it,
and
they
have
been
selling
it
for
two
to
three
years,
that
when
you
come
to
decide
whether
the
pipeline
has
a
need
for
that
gas
two
or
three
years
later,
you're
going
to
find
that
they
do.
you're
not
going
to
find
that
you'll
need
a
silly
decision
three
years
ago.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
indeed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
not
really.
not
really
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
the
principle
pipeline
proceedings
are
proceedings
in
which
the
pipeline
is
seeking
authority
to
construct
facilities,
to
make
sales,
and
to
make
sales
itself.
and
the
issue
of
pipeline
need
in
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
is,
does
the
pipeline
have
enough
gas
to
make
the
sale
that
it
is
proposing
feasible?
now,
it
is
true
that
in
some
cases
perhaps
many
did,
although
the
figure
isn't
in
the
record
the
commission
council
yesterday
said
about
75%
of
the
gas
involved
some
sort
of
the
future
sales,
involved
some
sort
of
pipeline
application.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
construction,
yes.
it
is
possible
that
the
issue
could
be
raised
there
but
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
i'm
complaining
about
the
100%.
because
(voice
overlap)
the
statutory
scheme
says
such
a
review
in
section
7
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
at
the
time
you
issue
a
certificate
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
there
are
apparently
were
some
conglomeration
of
various
hearings
in
which
authority
for
the
relatively
minor
facilities
to
attach
the
gas
have
been
held,
have
been
noticed
and
certificates
issued
in
the
past.
there
was
one
case
that
did
go
to
hearing,
the
lone
star
gathering
case
subsequent
to
this.
i
do
want
to
point
--
as
i
simply,
the
principal
type
of
pipeline
case,
the
case
where
the
pipeline
wants
to
make
sales.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
so.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
you
have.
i
want
to
get
to
the
budget
type
authority.
each
year,
several
years
ago,
the
commission
adopted
a
regulation.
there
had
been
a
contention
that
for
the
relatively
minor
facilities,
a
pipeline
might
need
to
attach
to
supplies.
and
in
some
cases,
apparently
25%
of
the
cases,
it
might
mean
no
facilities
at
all
to
attach
supplies.
the
sale
might
be
made
out
in
an
existing
point
on
the
pipeline's
facilities.
the
pipeline
each
year
will
say
we
would
like
general
blanket
authority
to
construct
such
facilities
as
we
need
to
attach
such
gas
as
we
may
buy
from
time
to
time.
the
gas
is
not
identified,
the
facilities
are
not
identified.
the
commission
said
in
adopting
this
regulation,
that
it
had
been
proposed
to
exempt
these
facilities
altogether
since
they
were
not
sales
facilities.
and
the
act
speaks
in
terms
of
sales,
regulating
sales,
and
the
facility
is
used
to
make
sales.
they
said,
“we
won't
exempt
them
altogether.
we'll
give
these
blanket
authorities.”
so
i
supposed
that
it
is
in
those
proceedings
where
the
pipeline
gets
whatever
authority
it
needs
but
there
is
no
study
in
those
proceedings
as
to
whether
the
pipeline
has
a
need
for
the
gas
or
not.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
at
no
time
in
the
future.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
i
think
i
understand
here
the
question,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
the
reason
for
the
answer
is
that
the
commission
says
that
there
have
been
other
proceedings
at
some
other
times.
they
are
not
identified.
they
say
some
of
them
perhaps
were
before
these
hearings
came
on.
some
were
after
these
hearings
came
on
but
they
were
not
identified
in
any
general
sense.
they
were
by
and
large,
this
budget
applications
which
there's
a
one
or
two-page
notice
that
identifies
nothing.
now,
there
was
one
proceeding
in
the
sinclair
case
about
almost
half
of
the
gas
in
the
sinclair
case
was
proposed
to
be
sold
to
lone
star
gathering
company
for
in
district
two,
lone
star
was
a
short
line
that
would
gather
the
gas,
do
what
processing
was
necessary,
resell
it
to
united
gas
pipeline.
the
sales
to
lone
star
were
included
in
the
sinclair
proceeding.
the
applications
of
lone
star
and
united
had
been
filed
sometime
before
we
had
intervened
in
that
proceeding.
the
commission
never
set
it
for
hearing.
it
issued
temporary
certificates
to
the
pipelines.
it
issued
first
temporaries
then
permanent
certificates
in
sinclair
to
the
producers
to
make
the
sale.
after
it
had
issued
the
certificates
to
sinclair,
it
set
lone
star
and
united
applications
for
hearing.
we
participated
in
that
hearing.
and
what
happened
was
very
interesting.
after
it
went
through
the
hearing
the
first
time,
the
commission
found
--
the
majority
of
the
commission
found
that
united
had
a
need
for
the
gas
and
it
should
be
approved.
and
what
they
had
done
in
sinclair
was
right.
and
the
concurring
opinion
on
that
case
pointed
out
that
all
the
commission
really
was
doing,
was
ratifying
its
prior
sinclair
opinion.
it
pointed
out
that
as
a
human
psychological
matter
if
you
will,
unless
need
as
examined
when
the
producers
have
their
applications
pending,
it
will
never
be
examined
at
all.
in
any
event,
the
commission
finally
need
issued
a
certificate.
we
then
applied
for
rehearing,
pointing
out
the
numerous
legal
and
factual
areas
that
the
commission
had
made.
the
commission
on
rehearing
concluded
that
united,
the
ultimate
purchaser
from
lone
star
gathering,
had
not
adequately
shown
need,
that
there
were
a
number
of
defects
in
its
presentation,
and
set
the
matter
rather
than
denied
a
certificate.
however,
it
set
the
matter
down
so
that
lone
star
and
united
could
try
a
second
time
to
prove
need.lone
star
and
united
first
ask
for
postponement,
another
postponement.
then
they
said,
“we
give
up.
we
really
don't
need
the
gas
if
that's
what
we
have
to
prove.”
their
certificates
were
cancelled
or
the
permanent
certificates
were
simply
revoked,
that
had
never
become
--
the
permanent
certificates
had
never
become
final.
and
that
gas
is
no
longer
being
sold
in
interstate
commerce,
almost
half
of
the
gas
in
the
sinclair
proceeding.
i
think
that
when
you
count,
if
there
is
a
time
to
test
it
and
particularly
if
the
judgment
is
not
clouded
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
already
granted
permanent
certification,
then
i
think
we
will
have
some
very
interesting
results
on
whether
there
is
a
need
for
gas
and
how
much
of
the
need.
but
the
statute
says
before
you
can
issue
a
certificate,
you
must
find
that
there's
a
need.
and
i
really
don't
understand
how
it
is
in
answered
to
say
“well,
we'll
issue
this
certificate
first
and
we
may
find
a
need
a
year
from
now
or
two
years
from
now
or
in
some
other
proceeding.”
the
statute
seems
to
say,
and
it
would
be
consistent
with
all
statutes
filing
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
that
before
you
issue
a
certificate
you
have
to
find
that
somebody
needs
the
service
or
the
sale
that's
proposed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
we
would
think
that
the
basic
question
here
is,
is
there
a
need
for
a
gas?
if
there
is
a
need
for
gas
--
if
there
is
no
need,
no
certificate.
if
there
is
a
need,
then
the
question
becomes
at
what
price,
what
initial
price
should
the
gas
be
sold.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
--
well,
substantially
yes.
there
is
one
purpose
i
think
for
which
a
rate
would
have
to
be
fixed,
and
that
is
caused
by
the
temporary
certificates.
during
the
pendency
of
these
proceedings,
the
commission
permitted
the
sales
to
be
made
at
prices,
which
we
believe
and
we
think
the
commission
believes,
are
excessive.
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
what
was
the
appropriate
rate
during
that
period
for
purposes
of
making
refunds.
but
other
than
that
and
had
there
been
no
temporaries,
there
would
be
no
need
to
go
to
the
in-line
question
at
all.
and
that
would
terminate
it
if
there's
no
need.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
on
the
other
hand,
much
of
the
problems
of
the
commission
gets
into
is
because,
it
issues
the
temporary
so
readily.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
emergency
to
justify
a
temporary.
the
commission
issues
temporaries
as
a
routine
matter,
and
i
will
address
myself
to
this
point
right
here
even
though
it's
slightly
out
of
order.
there
is
no
hearing.
application
for
temporary
can
be
a
one
or
two-page
sheet.
it
is
responded
to
by
a
letter.
the
commission
issues
temporaries
as
a
matter
of
routine.
every
applicant
gets
one
that
there
they
have
it.
now,
i
don't
think
the
temporaries
wherever
intended
to
be
issued
on
that
kind
of
basis,
i
don't
think
then
that
the
most
generous
concept
of
emergency
and
this
is
an
emergency
power.
it
has
granted
the
ex
parte
at
the
time
when
the
consumer
who
will
be
called
on
to
pay
these
charges
on
others
is
absent
from
the
proceeding.
i
don't
see
how
an
emergency
power
can
be
expanded
to
cover
routine
everyday
application.
but
if
there
were
an
emergency,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
the
type
of
finding
of
need
that
i'm
talking
about
at
that
time.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
logically
that
if
there's
no
public
need,
the
commission
has
no
business
issuing
a
temporary
certificate.
i
would
think
that
the
real
emergency
situation
is
one
where
the
public
is
about
to
go
out
of
gas
and
something
has
to
be
done
pretty
quick,
and
you
don't
have
time
for
a
hearing.
so
you
issue
a
temporary
certificate.
the
commission
issues
a
temporary
certificate
because
it
takes
it
a
while
to
get
around
to
deciding
it
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing.
i
don't
really
think
that's
an
emergency
situation.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
not
at
all.
no.
could
there
be
an
emergency
from
the
point
of
view,
yes.
i
think
that
that
might
be
a
possible
legitimate
interest.
but
i
would
like
to
run
through
very
briefly
the
grounds
for
an
emergency
certificate.
their
drainage,
drainage
means
you
have
two
wells
adjacent
to
each
other.
one
is
being
produced
and
the
gas
from
the
second
one
is
migrating
below
the
first
one.
in
the
sunray
temporary
certificate
that
mr.
coleman
read
to
you
yesterday,
the
allegation
was,
that
the
adjacent
well
had
been
contracted
to
be
sold
to
tennessee
gas
pipeline
and
was
being
sold.
and
sunray
wanted
to
get
a
temporary
to
sell
to
tennessee.
now,
there
was
no
public
interest
here
at
all
because
all
of
the
gas
would
go
to
tennessee
gas
pipeline
and
its
customers.
and
it
would
simply
--
whether
it
would
go
through
the
sunray
well
or
the
adjacent
well.
there
is
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct.
however,
since
you
--
the
statute
says
you
can't
make
a
sale
until
you
get
a
certificate.
the
statute
says
there
is
a
hearing.
now,
the
delay
between
the
time
you
filed
an
application
on
the
hearing
which
is
statutorily
created,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
create
an
emergency
right.
there
is
--
flaring
of
a
gas
is
a
basis.
flaring
occurs
when
you
have
gas
being
produced
from
a
well
that
produces
both
oil
and
gas.
the
producer
decides
he
wants
to
produce
it
in
order
to
derive
revenues
from
the
oil.
he
has
no
outlet
for
his
gas
so
it
is
simply
burned
off
in
effect.
the
states
can
control
flaring.
but
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
produce
is
a
decision
made
by
the
producer
to
derive
the
oil
revenues.
there
is
loss
of
lease.
some
of
the
leases
that
the
producers
have
with
their
lessors
provide
that
the
lease
shall
be
on
production
within
a
certain
time.
this
is
a
private
contract
condition.
then
there
is
the
broad
catch-all
category
which
i
think
explains
the
other
three,
it
renders,
the
other
three
really
mandatory.
and
that
is
an
economic
hardship.
and
the
commission
has
accepted
as
a
definition
of
economic
hardship
and
this
is
the
basis
of
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
temporary
applications.
the
loss
of
revenue
that
occurs
to
the
producer
during
the
time
he
is
waiting
for
permanent
certificate.
therefore
every
time
you
file
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate,
you
have,
under
the
commission's
regulation,
created
a
basis
for
an
emergency
because
you
will
have
to
wait
sometime
until
the
hearing
can
be
held.
it's
a
peculiar
concept
to
the
emergency,
i
think.
it's
an
unparalleled
one.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes,
it
always
makes
that
finding
in
the
statutory
line
of
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
right.
you
can't
say
we've
satisfied
the
statute
unless
you
make
the
findings
that
really
would
(voice
overlap)
mr.
morton
l.
simon
pardon?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
until
--
do
you
mean
until
the
pipeline
begins
taking
that
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that's
correct
but
the
pipeline
can
take
it
under
temporary
ser
--
there
was
a
case
in
louisiana.
tennessee
gas
transmission
cp
60-57
was
filed
in
1960.
we
intervened.
it
was
to
take
some
offshore
gas.
the
commission
granted
a
temporary
in
1961.
in
the
meantime,
the
producer
sales
were
certificated.
in
1964,
the
commission
noticed
it
again
and
said,
“does
anybody
still
object
to
this?”
and
we
said,
“yes
we
do.”
because
tennessee
is
in
a
take-or-pay
situation
and
we
want
to
examine
it.
and
i
said
“oh!”
and
i
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
and
that's
where
it's
been.
so
it's
not
that
easy
to
get
a
hearing
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
give
you
a
hearing,
and
the
commission
really
doesn't.
that
tennessee
line
has
been
going
for
seven
years
under
a
temporary
certificate.
there
has
never
been
a
finding
as
we've
been
ready
from
the
date
the
notice
was
filed.
to
go
to
hearing
on
whether
there
was
a
need.
and
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
essentially
there
are
two
aspects
of
need.
one
is,
is
there
a
public
need
for
this
gas?
does
the
public
needed
to
receive
gas
service
or
does
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well
yes,
sales
being
made
to
the
consumer,
through
the
distributor,
and
through
the
pipeline.
now,
if
the
public
can
be
adequately
served
without
the
addition
of
this
gas,
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
this
gas.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
this
particular
gas.
if
the
public
can
be
served
without
the
addition
of
this
gas
then
there
is
no
public
need.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
if
perhaps
this
pipeline
could
sell
it,
i
want
to
go
into
this
take-or-pay
problem
because
it
illuminates
i
think
the
whole
problem
of
need.
in
other
words
if
the
pipeline
is
selling
say
800,000
mcf
a
day,
that's
its
market
demand.
and
if
they
presently
has
contracts
that
give
it
800,000
a
day,
and
then
it
goes
up
and
buys
another
100,000
a
day,
is
there
a
need
for
the
other
100,000?
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
it?
now,
what
has
happened
is
the
contracts
have
minimum
take
provisions.
these
are
20-year
contracts
and
they
provide
for
takeover
the
life
normally
based
on
an
evaluation
of
the
reserves.
they
contained
minimum
provisions.
you
take
so
much
depending
on
the
reserves.
you
take
10,000
mcf
a
day
and
if
you
don't
take
it,
you
will
pay
for
it
anyway.
now,
what
has
happened
and
this
is
why
we
started
to
raise
the
need
issue.
we
found
that
the
pipelines
were
getting
in
situations
increasingly
where
they
were
paying
for
gas
that
they
could
not
physically
put
through
their
system.
they
had
cut
all
of
their
contracts
down
to
the
minimum
take
provision
that
it
provided.
and
not
withstanding
that,
they
were
paying
for
gas
they
couldn't
take
and
accruing
huge
balances.
united
gas
pipeline
paid
$22
million
for
gas
that
it
physically
could
not
put
through
its
system.
and
united
was
one
of
the
purchasers
in
the
cases
that
are
before
this
court.
it
came
to
the
commission
on
a
rate
case.
now
it
says,
“we
want
to
capitalize
it,
include
it
in
our
rate
base,
increase
rates
over
what
they
would
otherwise
be
to
reflect
this
$22
million
for
gas
that
we've
paid
for
but
couldn't
take.”
the
new
york
commission
objected
to
that.
and
the
commission
said,
“well,
that's
alright.
we'll
let
united
include
in
its
rate
base.”
there
are
other
problems
because
once
this
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
in
the
orders
here
under
review?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no.
no
findings
at
all.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
certainly
is,
mr.
justice
black.
it
certainly
is.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct
and
the
consumer
will
be
taxed
for
it.
that
is
the
heart
of
it,
yes
sir.
there
are
other
aspects
of
take-or-pay.
what
happens
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
it
should.
i
think
that
that
was
the
way
the
act
was
written
that
in
the
certificate
case,
you
do
not
permit
improper
charges
to
become
embedded
in
the
pipelines
cost.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
would
depend
on
how
minor.
but
i
think
that's
right.
it's
trivial
and
certainly
not.
the
problem
that
we
have
found
is
that
this
situation
has
become
very
widespread
throughout
the
industry.
mr.
schiff
said
yesterday
that
the
commission
found
that
it
was
decreasing.
that's
just
not
so.
we
quote
from
there
in
1955
and
1960
--
the
commissions
1955
and
1966
annual
reports
to
congress.
in
those
reports,
the
commission
shows
that
the
take-or-pay
balances
was
increasing
and
something
like
65
million
to
85
million.
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
our
reply
brief
where
that
is
cited.
it
was
called
to
my
attention
that
although
the
commission
has
to
come
up
with
its
1967
annual
report
is
yet
the
same
figure
is
available
in
another
commission
publications
statistics
of
natural
gas
pipelines.
and
that
at
the
latest
figure
as
of
the
end
of
1966
has
risen
another
10%
to
some
$95
million
or
prepayments.
the
situation
is
getting
--
these
problems
don't
go
away.
they
don't
go
away
because
the
commission
refuses
to
look
at
it.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
they
closed
that
out.
it
was
a
--
it
might
have
been
a
good
proceeding.
one
of
the
problems
with
this,
it
was
a
rule-making
proceeding.
it
was
instituted
in
1961
when
the
commission
first
became
aware
of
these
problems.
now,
what
their
proposed
rule
would
have
done,
mr.
justice
white,
was
essentially
two
things.
it
would
have
limited
the
type
of
minimum
take
provision
that
could
be
put
in
any
contract.
and
the
effect
of
this
would
have
been
that
pipelines
would
have
not
have
gotten
into
take-or-pay
situations.
the
second
thing
it
would
do
is
provide
a
longer
period
for
them
to
make
up
the
gas
once
they
got
in
a
take-or-pay
situation.
the
commission
let
this
sit
for
some
six
years
until
the
eve
of
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
then
they
came
out
with
their
rule
and
the
rule
does
nothing
about
the
type
of
minimum
take
provision
that
can
be
put
in
a
contract.
it
does
nothing
to
alleviate
or
to
prevent
the
pipeline
from
getting
into
a
minimum
take
--
into
a
take-or-pay
provision.
all
it
did
was
say,
that
they
shall
have
five
years
to
make
up
any
prepayments
that
they
have
made.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
would
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
when
you
make
that
kind
of
a
contract,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
your
judgment
is
affected
by
whose
going
to
pay
for
it.
and
i
think
if
you're
not
going
to
pay
for
it
certainly
it's
desirable
to
go
out
and
preempt
as
much
gas
as
you
can.
don't
let
your
competitor
get
it,
don't
let
any
pipeline
get
it,
i
suppose
that
if
a
pipeline
could
tie
up
all
of
the
gas
that
there
is
in
southern
louisiana
and
the
texas
gulf
coast
and
if
there
would
be
assured
that
its
cost
in
doing
so
would
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer,
it
would
like
to
do
it
whether
it
needed
it
or
not.
it
would
then
be
assured
of
every
market
there
is.
this
goes
to
one
of
the
conservation
issues
too
because
what
has
happened
here
because
the
commission
does
that
considered
need
is,
it
leads
to
wasteful
and
preemptive
buying.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
contracts.
that
enters
into
a
contract,
sales
contract.
that
sales
contract
comes
before
the
commission
in
the
producers
certificate
case
which
is
what
we
have
right
here.
now,
there
are
other
aspects
as
there
are
other
injuries
that
are
caused
by
take-or-pay
problems.
i
just
want
to
mention
one
of
them
and
that
is
this.
the
take-or-pay
problems
became
more
onerous,
more
observable
in
the
late,
very
late
50s
perhaps
and
early
60s.
and
the
earlier
contracts
did
not
have
either
this
kind
of
take-or-pay
provisions
or
strict
take-or-pay
provisions.
what
the
pipelines
first
started
to
do
therefore,
was
to
cut
back
on
their
older
contracts,
cut
back
the
takes
under
the
older
contracts
which
did
not
have
a
minimum
take
requirement.
so
they
might
have
two
contracts,
one
calling
for
the
purchase
of
gas
of
20
cents
recently
contracted.
the
other
calling
for
the
purchase
of
gas
at
9
cents
contracted
say
10
or
15
years
ago.
they're
entitled
under
their
9-cent
contract
say
to
take
10,000
mcf
a
day,
but
they
can
take
no
gas
without
any
penalty.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
because
it's
the
producer
--
it
should
be
tackled
in
the
producer
hearings
because
it's
the
producer
that's
asking
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
in
reality,
the
one
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
the
pipeline
is
the
purchaser
in
the
producer
hearing.
i
suppose
in
any
type
of
proceeding
where
an
applicant
is
seeking
a
certificate,
it
is
the
applicant
who
shows
his
market
although
his
market
is
composed
of
people
who
are
not
himself.
i
suppose
that
a
tracker
who
is
seeking
a
certificate
should
bring
in
shippers
to
show
that
the
shippers
have
a
need
for
the
service
proposed.
certainly,
in
the
pipeline
cases,
the
pipeline
proves
its
market
by
bringing
in
its
customers.
it
will
bring
in
the
distributing
companies
who
will
testify
as
to
what
their
needs
for
the
gas
will
be.
and
this
--
the
commission
has
suggested
that
it's
a
difficult
administrative
problem
and
it's
backed
off
and
said
really
it
isn't.
but
we
had
in
these
proceedings
a
total
of
five
pipeline
purchasers.
all
that
would
have
been
required
was
to
bring
a
witness
from
each
of
the
five
to
explain
what
their
present
sales
are,
what
their
present
minimum
and
maximum
entitlements
to
are
under
their
existing
contracts.
it's
not
that
difficult
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
it
simply
to
grant
some
authority
to
make
the
sale
as
filed.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes
sir.
i
would
like
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
each
pipeline?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
where
the
matter
is
raised.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
whether
it
needed
this
additional
gas
in
order
to
satisfy
its
market,
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
don't
think
so.
it
isn't
that
much
of
a
pipe
--
a
pipeline
will
bring
in
some
40
or
50
customers
in
each
proceeding
to
show
its
market.
i
do
want
to
move
on
to
the
in-line
issue.
i've
spent
more
on
need
that
i
had
intended.
now,
on
the
in-line,
and
the
in-line
doctrine
comes
from
this
court's
catco
decision
which
said
that
in
certificating
new
sales,
the
commission
must
protect
the
consumer
against
excessive
rates
and
charges
by
denying
sales
that
are
out
of
line.
it
is
from
this
concept
that
the
in-line
and
the
hold
of
the
line
language
has
come.
now
what
the
commission
did
here,
we're
talking
about
the
texas
gulf
coast.
there
are
a
series
of
events.
in
september
1960,
the
commission
established
guidelines
in
each
of
the
three
areas
at
18
cents
per
mcf.
there
is
not
the
slightest
question
in
the
world
that
that
did
not
conform
to
this
court's
catco
requirement.
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
would
so
argue.
18
cents
was
out
of
line.
the
commission
subsequently
found
for
each
of
the
three
areas
that
on
september
28,
1960
when
it
promulgated
its
guidelines,
the
in-line
prices
in
the
three
areas
were
15
cents
in
districts
4
and
2,
and
16
cents
in
district
3.
indeed,
those
in-line
determinations
subsequently
in
1962
and
1963
had
found
15
cents
was
in-line
in
district
4
and
2,
and
16
cents
was
in-line
in
district
3.
it
amended
its
guideline
levels
at
that
time.
instead
of
amending
its
guideline
levels
to
the
in-line
level
that
had
just
found
as
two
of
the
five
commissioners
urged,
it
fixed
the
guideline
level
one
cent
above
the
in-line
level
that
had
just
found
16
cents
in
districts
4
and
2,
17
cents
in
district
3.
it
then
sets
the
instant
cases
that
we
have
here
for
hearing.
after
hearing,
the
commission
found
that
wonderful
to
relate
the
in-line
level
for
the
period
after
the
policy
statement
was
the
elevated
by
one
cent
guideline
levels
that
it
had
fixed
at
the
outset
of
these
hearings.
now,
a
difference
of
one
cent
per
mcf,
while
it
sounds
small,
when
we
apply
it
to
the
industry
as
a
whole
amounts
to
enormous
sums
of
money.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
they
are
not
that
large
but
then
the
chairman
of
the
commission
has
pointed
out
that
if
you
applied
one
cent
across
the
board
to
all
natural
gas
sales,
you're
talking
about
a
$150
million
a
year.
if
you
apply
it
to
all
of
the
estimated
known
reserves
in
the
ground,
you're
talking
about
$2.5
billion.
now,
the
purpose
of
finding
an
in-line
level,
we
submit,
was
to
protect
the
consumer.
the
way
this
works
is,
once
the
in-line
level
is
found
that
is
the
initial
price
the
producer
can
charge,
he
can
file
up
under
section
4
for
an
increase,
but
if
he
can't
justify
the
increase,
he
has
to
make
refunds.
the
evil
of
a
high
in-line
prices
that
there
is
no
way
to
catch
by
refunds
or
otherwise,
the
excess
in
the
event
that
it
should
be
determined
that
that
in-line
price
is
higher
than
the
subsequent
just
and
reasonable
rate.
we
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
in-line
pricing
as
you
start
with
catco
is
to
find
the
line
and
then
hold
it.
now,
the
commission
talks
about,
it
has
to
go
to
current
conditions
and
contemporaneous
conditions.
first
of
all,
there's
nothing
in
the
cases
that
suggests
that
you
have
to
go
to
contracts
which
is
what
the
commission
did.
the
commission
limited
its
view
here
to
contracts
entered
into
in
amerada
for
example
between
1960
and
1962.
but
during
this
times
span,
there
were
enormous
volumes
of
gas
being
sold
under
contracts
dated
prior
thereto.
the
commission
ignored
all
of
those
prices,
fixed
itself
only
on
the
contracts
entered
into
between
1960
and
'62.
those
contracts
had
been
entered
into
at
high
prices.
we
had
intervened
on
the
applications
to
make
those
sales.
the
commission
says
because
we
intervened,
there
are
no
permanently
certificated
prices.
we
will
therefore
look
at
the
prices
we
have
temporarily
certificated.
in
fact,
we
looked
at
the
very
prices
that
are
before
us.
the
commission
in
writing
at
its
16-cent
guideline,
it
relied
on
38
contracts.
36
of
those
contracts
were
the
contracts
at
issue
in
the
amerada
preceding
where
we
were
holding
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
in-line
level
should
be.
the
commission
said,
well
we
will
grant
certification
on
the
basis
of
the
temporary
certificates
we've
issued.
as
noted,
these
temporary
certificates
are
issued
on
an
ex
parte
basis.
they
are
not
reviewable.
when
this
whole
business
started
out
at
the
time
of
skelly,
and
the
commission
first
said
that
it
would
not
make
refunds,
we
appealed
the
skelly
decision
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
at
the
same
time,
we
appealed
some
temporary
certificates
which
had
just
been
issued
which
were
issued
in
our
view
at
out
of
line
prices.
the
two
appeals
as
mcdermott
and
skelly
were
heard
before
the
same
panel
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
at
the
same
time
within
a
couple
of
weeks.
they
were
decided
within
a
couple
of
weeks
of
each
other.
both
opinions
were
written
by
judge
fahy.
and
in
essence,
what
he
said
was,
we
cannot
make
a
determination
on
a
temporary
certificate
whether
it's
right
or
wrong.
these
matters
are
not
foreclosed
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
however,
in
skelly
he
said,
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
the
commission
has
to
go
back
and
do
what
is
right,
make
it
right
from
the
beginning.
we
think
that's
right.
if
the
commission
doesn't
have
the
power
to
make
it
right
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
then
we
think
that
the
temporary
certificate
is
wrong,
right
from
its
inception
because
it
would
then
be
violating
catco.
and
of
course
this
goes
to
a
question
that
you
asked
mr.
justice
white
yesterday.
it
was
answered
by
mr.
coleman
and
i
want
to
support
his
answer.
could
the
commission
say
in
a
temporary
certificate,
“we're
giving
you
a
temporary
certificate
at
18
cents
or
20
cents
or
any
price
and
we're
not
going
to
make
you
give
anything
back
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
no
matter
what”?
could
it
do
that?
no.
we
don't
think
legally
it
has
the
power
to
give
that
kind
of
money
away
to
be
that
generous.
catco
said
you
have
to
provide
a
complete
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection.
and
what
was
involved
in
catco
was
the
excessive
initial
price
between
the
time
of
certification
and
the
time
you
would
catch
up
to
the
excess
in
a
section
5
proceeding.
but
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
excess
price
in
the
temporary
certificate
and
the
time
you
catch
up
with
it
on
permanent
certification.
there
is
no
gap
in
the
act.
this
court
has
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
pardon?
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
you
do.
i
think
you
should.
and
i
think
that
what
you
should
say
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
right.
now,
we
filed
that
request.
at
the
--
the
commission
had
just
held
in
skelly
that
at
the
end
of
the
preceding,
it
wouldn't
order
refunds.
and
the
amerada
preceding
was
pending.
we
said
“alright,
if
you
don't
think
it's
fair
at
the
end,
you've
got
all
of
this
outstanding
at
16,
17,
18
cents.
we're
litigating.
we're
saying
that
15
is
the
highest.
that
at
least
put
in
a
condition
now
if
you
don't
think
it's
fair.”
we
said
this
is
without
prejudice
to
the
appeals
we're
taking
in
mcdermott
that
you
have
no
right
at
the
outset
to
do
it.
it's
without
prejudice
to
the
appeal
we're
taking
in
skelly
that
you
can
make
refunds
at
the
end.
and
the
commission
said,
“oh!
well
we
won't
do
it
here
either.”
we
didn't
appeal
that.
i
agree
that
left
us
with
our
skelly
remedy,
but
we
won
skelly.
the
commission
has
recognized
that
and
that
has
changed
the
law.
there
are
certain
of
the
comments
that
were
made
by
mr.
schiff.
i
can't
get
to
them
all.
i
do
want
to
get
to
one.
he
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
in-line
pricing
was
to
prevent
rate
increase
filings.
now,
that
is
just
dead
wrong.
you
can't
find
it
anywhere
in
the
opinions,
and
in
fact
it's
illogical.
if
an
applicant
comes
in
for
an
18-cent
price,
if
you'll
allow
him
his
18-cent
price,
and
that's
all
he
has
the
contract
for,
obviously,
he
can't
file
up
under
this
court's
mobile
doctrine.
if
you
cut
him
back
and
that's
what
catco
was
talking
about,
cutting
back
to
the
in-line
level,
certainly,
he
then
has
a
contract
right
to
file
up.
but
it
seems
a
very
strange
thing
to
say
that
you're
preventing
a
rate
increase
filing
by
giving
the
producer
everything
that
he
would
get
out
of
a
rating
for
his
filing
right
at
the
outset.
i
have
--
i'm
afraid
i
spent
more
time
than
i
intended
on
need
issue
and
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
tell
during
his
presentation
stated
that
in
the
prior
cases,
the
commission
had
found
15
cents
as
the
in-line
level
for
the
1950s
and
that
the
question
before
the
commission
in
this
proceedings
was
to
determine
whether
there
were
changed
circumstances
which
would
justify
a
change
in
the
in-line
price.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
his
statement
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
prior
in-line
finding
is
not
an
in-line
finding
for
the
50s.
in
skelly,
for
the
example,
the
commission
had
before
basically
nine
contracts
executed
in
1959
and
1960.
and
it
predicated
its
finding
on
the
conditions
that
existed
from
1958
through
1960.
in
the
amerada
case,
we
had
contracts
for
the
two-year
period
beginning
immediately
after
skelly
from
september
1960
through
august
1962.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
is,
what
were
the
changed
circumstances
that
the
commission
relied
on
to
elevate
its
in-line
level
by
a
penny.
the
changed
circumstances
were
essentially
the
higher
prices
negotiated
in
the
marketplace.
and
i
think
that
this
brings
us
not
only
to
the
whole
suspect
line
doctrine
but
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
phrased
by
judge
bazelon
below.
he
said
the
need
for
the
fpc
and
for
a
concept
like
in-line
prices
arises
primarily
because
the
unregulated
marketplace
cannot
protect
the
consumer
adequately.
congress
created
the
fpc
to
protect
the
consumer
from
the
marketplace,
not
simply
to
reflect
it.
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
marketplace
was
leading
to
higher
prices
of
pipelines
and
producers
who
are
willing
to
negotiate
for
higher
prices
in
the
60s
than
they
were
in
1959
and
1960.
this
fact,
far
from
contradicting
a
need
for
holding
the
line
for
fpc
control
merely
emphasizes
it.
now,
the
commission
attempts
to
say,
“well,
we
aren't
relying
on
the
naked
marketplace
as
we
did
in
the
catco
case
which
led
to
this
court's
reversal.
we're
relying
on
the
fact
that
we
have
issued
temporary
certificates.
but
the
prices
contained
the
temporary
certificates
are
not
approved.
they
are
not
final.
they
are
subject
to
revision,
happy
outcome
of
the
hearing
on
those
temporary
certificates.
that
price
is
the
price
that
obtains
only
during
the
pendency
of
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
should
be
permanently
certificated.
and
indeed
once
it's
permanently
certificated,
it
can
be
replaced
by
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
at
a
later
time.
but
it's
for
this
reason
that
no
reliance
can
be
placed
on
temporary
--
temporarily
certificated
prices.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
certificating
an
in-line
level
of
15
cents
and
an
in-line
level
of
16
cents?
it
is
just
this,
under
both
circumstances,
the
producer
can
file
it
up
to
its
contract
level,
be
it
16,
17,
18
cents,
or
whatever.
however,
if
the
ultimate
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
determined
in
the
area
rate
proceedings,
turns
out
to
be
lower
than
16
cents,
if
the
in-line
--
the
difference
between
15
and
16
cannot
be
recouped
unless
the
in-line
level
has
been
fixed
at
15.
it's
possible
that
the
just
and
reasonable
level
could
be
even
lower
than
15
cents.
in
that
case,
the
consumer
is
just
disadvantaged
without
any
recourse
at
all.
but
the
fact
is
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
there
are
no
conditions,
no
conditions
are
put
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
no,
no
sir.
there
are
none
in
any
others
that
i
know
of.
the
permanent
condition
--
the
conditions
that's
put
in
is
to
certificate
at
an
in-line
level
which
is
the
initial
certificating
level.
that's
what
you
can
charge
until
you
change
it
under
section
4.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
there
are
no
refunds
if
you
don't
change
it.
that's
right.
there
is
no
way
to
touch
that
at
all.
that's
firm
and
fixed.
now,
the
basis
for
the
determination
--
oh,
incidentally
i
would
say
that
the
commission
never
made
any
finding
that
there
was
less
need
for
consumer
protection
with
respect
to
these
contracts
which
have
the
16-cent
level
than
it
had
for
the
contracts
in
skelly
which
had
a
15-cent
level.
there
was
in
all
three
of
these
cases
a
diminution
in
the
degree
of
consumer
protection
over
the
prior
series
of
cases
without
any
finding
by
the
commission
that
such
diminution
was
proper
or
was
required.
now,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
in-line
price?
in
each
of
these
proceedings,
i
want
to
run
through
it
very
briefly.
in
amerada,
i
understand
this
morning
that
i
said
that
of
the
38
contracts
relied
on
for
guideline
level,
and
i
should
have
said
for
in-line
level
purposes
here,
36
of
the
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
don't
know
of
any
that
they
have
ever
done
that
way,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
didn't
say
that.
i
don't
know
whether
they
do.
let
me
say
that.
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
arisen.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
that's
right.
there
is
no
reparation.
now,
if
they
put
in
a
specific
condition
for
that,
i
don't
know.
we're
talking
about
two
different
situations.
if
the
certificate
let's
say,
at
15
cents,
and
the
in-line
price
turns
out
to
be
14
later,
there
is
no
power
to
get
reparation
on
the
difference
between
15
and
14.
if
they
can
issue
a
certificate
conditioned
at
15
and
said
further
more,
anything
we
later
find
in
an
area
rate
proceeding
to
be
unjust
and
reasonable
shall
be
refunded.
then
you
would
have
the
propriety
of
that
kind
of
a
condition.
the
commissioner
has
never
imposed
that
kind
of
a
condition
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
about
imposing
a
condition
that's
not
in
this
case?
yes.
i
would
hesitate
to
say.
i'm
a
great
believer.
i'm
leaving
it
to
the
litigation
lending
their
eyes
with
this.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
that
is
correct.
i
thought
mr.
justice
brennan
was
asking
me
about
a
situation
not
present
in
callery,
not
present
in
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes,
certainly.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
yes.
since
you
have
mentioned
callery,
i
would
like
to
turn
right
to
that.
at
this
point,
in
callery,
this
court
twice
mentioned
what
the
standard
is
for
fixing
in-line
price.
it
said
at
382
u.s.
227,
consumer
protection
is
afforded
by
keeping
the
in-line
price
--
by
keeping
the
in-line
price
at
the
level
where
substantial
amounts
of
gas
have
been
certificated
to
enter
the
market
under
contemporaneous
certificates
no
longer
subject
to
judicial
review
or
in
any
way
suspect.
now,
there's
no
question
here
that
the
commission
use
suspect
prices.
again
the
court
said
at
page
229,
the
in-line
price
of
18.5
cents
is
supported
by
the
contract
prices
in
the
south
louisiana
area
that
were
not
suspect.
again
there's
not
question
that
the
temporarily
certificated
prices
and
the
contract
prices,
that
the
commission
relied
on
in
this
case,
the
elevated
in-line
level
and
thereby
reduced
the
amount
of
consumer
protection
were
suspect.
i
said
in
amerada
that
36
of
the
38
contracts
which
have
been
temporarily
certificated
and
were
relied
on
for
the
guideline
level
were
the
very
--
to
fix
the
in-line
level,
were
the
very
contracts
before
the
commission
itself.
in
sinclair,
the
commission
referred
to
the
fact
and
they
said
this
out
on
page
33
of
their
brief.
they
were
impressed
by
the
fact
that
40%
of
the
total
volume
was
moving
at
18
cents.
that
40%
was
all
under
temporary
certificates.
three
quarters
of
that
40%
were
sales
to
lone
star
gathering
company
which
as
i
discussed
this
morning
under
the
need
issue,
it
was
subsequently
determined.
there
was
no
need
for
it.
the
certificates
were
vacated.
that
75%
of
the
40%,
three
quarters
of
the
40%,
those
sales
are
no
longer
being
made
in
interstate
commerce.
yet,
that's
what
the
commission
relied
on.
they
relied
on
sales
that
are
no
longer
being
made
in
interstate
commerce.
that
fact
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
would
require
vacation
of
the
commissions
finding
that
the
in-line
level
is
16
cents.
i
would
point
out
too
that
those
were
all
contracts
that
were
before
the
commission
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
in-line
price
for
permanent
certification.
in
the
hawkins
case,
the
commission
seems
to
have
shifted
its
basis
for
getting
the
price
of
a
penny.
and
it
says
that
its
primary
reliance
was
on
three
permanently
certificated
18-cent
prices.
those
three
18-cent
prices,
i
don't
want
to
go
into
all
of
it,
but
those
three
prices
were
deemed
suspect
by
the
examiner,
by
the
commission
staff,
by
the
two
dissenters,
and
we
set
out
the
reasons
in
volume
3
of
the
appendix
of
pages
312,
313,
why
those
were
suspect.
the
commission
never
addressed
itself
to
a
discussion
of
whether
or
not
they
were
in
fact
suspect.
but
we
think
clearly
under
the
prior
court
decisions,
they
were.
now,
the
commission
says,
it
attempts
to
get
around
this
business
of
the
fact
the
prices
were
suspect
by
saying,
well
we
gave
discounted
weight,
we
didn't
give
full
weight
to
it.
but
the
problem
with
giving
weight
anyway
to
suspect
prices
is
the
suspect
prices
are
probative
nothing
at
all
of
no
factor
that
is
relevant
in
an
in-line
determination.
and
you
don't
cure
the
defect
of
giving
weight
to
inadmissible
evidence
that
has
no
probative
value
by
saying,
you
gave
discounted
weight.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
discounted
weight
was
crucial.
the
commission
itself
said
in
sinclair
that
if
we
didn't
give
any
weight,
we
would
have
arrived
at
a
lower
level.
and
so
you
had
an
inadmissible
confession
and
you
had
no
other
evidence
so
you
needed
some
evidence,
so
you
let
it
in
because
it
provided
that
the
term
would
be
reduced
by
one-half
or
one-fourth.
if
it's
inadmissible,
it's
inadmissible.
if
it's
not
probative,
it's
not
probative.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
get
into
a
tyranny
of
lack
of
standards
and
vague
standards.
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
morton
l.
simon
well,
let's
see
what
the
commission
itself
said.
at
page
33
of
its
brief
it
says,
it's
speaking
here
of
the
sinclair
case.
it
says,
“no
doubt
on
this
evidence,
the
court
examining
the
matter
de
novo
might
choose
a
different
price
line.
there
is
room
for
arguing
that
the
price
line
should
be
15
cents
or
15.5
cents
or
even
as
high
as
18
cents.
but
in
the
final
analysis,
the
statute
commits
the
decision
to
the
expert
judgment
of
the
commission.
now,
as
i
understand
that
they're
saying
based
on
the
evidentiary
record
before
that
they
could
have
come
up
with
anything
between
15
and
18
cents.
and
i
submit
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
that
kind
of
standard
is
just
too
vague.
it
has
no
meaning.
if
that's
what
it
is,
then
the
hearing
that
we
had,
we
might
just
as
well
have
forgotten
it.
if
that,
there
is
that
much
range
for
the
commission
to
pick
an
in-line
level,
then
i
think
that
the
in-line
determination
and
the
protection
that
this
court
intended
in
catco,
have
been
a
terrible
waste
of
time.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
certain
statements
made
by
mr.
caskin
with
respect
to
the
policy
statement.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
possible
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
to
take
an
appeal
from
the
policy
statement
when
it
was
issued.
it
was
issued
without
notice,
without
hearing,
without
record.
the
state
of
wisconsin
representing
the
consumer
interest,
filed
an
application
for
rehearing
which
is
a
prerequisite
for
review.
the
commission
rejected
that
application.
the
state
of
wisconsin
took
an
appeal
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
that
commission
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
policy
statement
fixes
no
rights.
it
fixes
no
procedures.
when
it
is
applied,
that
is
the
time
to
approach
it
when
it
is
implemented.
i
would
point
out
too
that
in
june
of
1962,
the
new
york
commission
filed
the
petition
to
amend
the
policy
statement.
that
petition
has
been
pending
for
six
years.
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
get
any
action
on
it.
when
the
commission
did
implement
the
policy
statement
in
a
case
like
mcdermott,
we
did
appeal.
the
dc
circuit
said,
“we
don't
have
a
full
record.”
these
matters
can
all
be
worked
out.
we
did
attack
specifically
in
the
mcdermott
appeal,
the
failure
to
include
and
express
refund
condition,
we
attack
the
fact
that
the
price
was
out
of
line
in
the
temporary.
the
dc
circuit
said,
“these
matters,
we
don't
have
a
full
record
before
as
these
matters
can
all
be
determined
on
permanent
certification.
that
is
the
time
to
obtain
it.”
now,
mr.
johnson
has
suggested
that
the
distributor
companies
are
here
before
you
because
they
will
retain
a
large
amount
of
money
if
they
can
and
that
it's
purely
a
selfish
interest.
first
of
all,
a
statement
would
not
apply
in
any
event
to
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
not
a
distributor.
with
respect
to
the
three
distributors
i
represent,
i
like
to
state
that
two
of
them,
brooklyn
union
gas
company,
long
island
lighting
company
have
purchased
gas
adjustment
clauses
in
their
contract,
the
effect
of
which
is
that
any
dollar
that
they
get
back
out
of
this
proceeding
will
flow
right
through
to
their
customers.
they
will
not
retain
it.
with
respect
to
philadelphia
electric
company,
i
had
occasion
to
check
what
they
had
done
with
the
monies
they
have
gotten
back
through
the
end
of
1966.
they
had
received
$4
million
from
their
two
pipeline
suppliers,
part
of
it,
being
producer
refunds
that
the
pipelines
have
passed
on.
and
they
had
refunded
or
flow
through
to
their
customers,
passed
on
to
their
customers
99.6%
of
that.
now,
i
think
that
this
is
a
meretricious
argument.
i
think
if
there's
any
question
at
all,
certainly
the
clients
i
represent
would
have
no
problem
if
this
court
where
to
say
that
the
money
should
flow
through
directly
to
the
consumer.
we
are
here
trying
to
vindicate
the
consumer
interest.
we're
not
trying
to
make
the
money
for
ourselves.
i
would
point
out
too
that
as
to
some
of
the
refunds
that
were
withheld
by
some
distributors,
they
may
well
have
been
used
to
offset
rate
increases.
they
may
well
have
benefited
the
consumer
in
other
ways.
in
any
event,
they
don't
apply
so
far
as
these
refunds
are
concerned
with
respect
to
my
clients.
with
respect
to
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
refund
power,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
amerada,
the
commission
declined
in
its
original
amerada
order,
opinion
422
in
1964,
the
commission
declined
to
take
any
action
on
refunds.
in
our
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
and
in
our
appeal
here,
we
took
the
position
that
the
commission's
failure
to
take
action
was
error,
that
it
was
required
to
act
and
that
it
was
required
that
it
had
the
duty
to
order
refunds.
if
we
are
correct
in
that
contention
which
is
before
this
court,
and
if
this
court
should
find
that
we
are
correct,
then
you
don't
get
into
the
problem
of
the
equities.
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
commission's
subsequent
order
opinion
501,
substantially
moots
our
appeal
on
that
point
if
501
does
satisfy
our
request
on
that
point.
but
our
appeal
right
from
the
beginning
was
that
the
commission
had
the
power
and
the
duty
to
order
refunds
at
the
time
that
it
issued
permanent
certificates.
i
think
that
the
issue
we
have
here
in
these
cases
is
one
of
proper
administrative
standards,
does
the
commission
have
to
explain
in
a
meaningful
way
what
it
did?
does
it
have
to
provide
adequate
protection
for
the
consumer?
we
would
ask
that
you
find
that
the
commission
must
make
a
finding
of
need
before
it
certificates,
that
it
must
hold
the
line
at
the
level
that
it
previously
found
and
not
elevate
it
by
reference
to
temporary
certificates
and
that
refunds
were
required
to
make
the
consumer
hold
for
the
out
of
line
amounts
paid.
mr.
morton
l.
simon
oh!
yes.
i
meant
to
respond
to
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
amerada
proceeding
arose
in
1962.
the
hawkins
and
sinclair
in
a
related
term
(inaudible)
proceedings
came
on
for
hearing
1964.
at
1962
and
through
1962,
we
were
willing
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
a
need
or
at
least
we
were
not
raising
that
issue.
we
were
attempting
to
focus
in
on
the
price
issue.
and
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
either
we
did
not
raise
it
or
in
some
cases,
union
texas
was
another
contemporaneous
case
we
stipulated.
but
we
became
increasingly
aware
between
the
institution
of
the
amerada
proceeding
and
hawkins-sinclair
that
the
pipelines
were
getting
into
increasing
difficulty
that
they
were
having
to
make
dump,
the
low
cost
dump
sales
from
oil
re-fillers
for
example
because
they
had
these
take-or-pay
problems
for
their
use.
and
so
by
1964,
we
concluded
that
we
could
no
longer
stipulate
that
there
was
a
need.
if
--
had
amerada
come
later
we
would
have
raised
it.
had
the
others
come
earlier,
we
probably
wouldn't
have
it
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
