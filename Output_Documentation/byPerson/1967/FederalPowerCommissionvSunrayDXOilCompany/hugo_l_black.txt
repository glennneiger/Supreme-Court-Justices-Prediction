on

may
i
ask

what
is
the

between
the

you
aid

to
the
need

the
fixation
of

in

would
fall?
justice

including
the
fixing
of

justice
hugo

black
excuse
me;
i
thought
you
said
--
what
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you,
state
as
simple
as
you
can
what
it
is
the
need
that
they
should
find,
need
to
do
what?
justice

to
receive
any
gas
service?

for

this

justice

black
you
mean,
if
there
are
other

who
could
sell
it.
justice

black
is
there
any
finding
that
the
commission
on
that
particular
point
which
you
have
just
discussed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
one
of
the
things
you're
complaining
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
there
should
be
an
issue
determined
when
you
raised
that
someone
raised
the
question
that
they
do
not
need
this
gas
as
simply
purchase
of
something
they
do
not
need
and
they'll
have
to
pay
for
it
and
that
money
will
be
wasted?
justice
hugo

black
but
why
should
that
not
that
be
handled
at
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
just
a
minor
thing.
you
wouldn't
say
that
after
they
begun
with
--
justice

black
can
the
pipeline
buy
without
the
commission's
consent?
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
can
identify
that
as
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
main
differences
between
the
producers
and
the
distributors
to
consumers,
the
two
questions
which
you
have
raised
in
this
brief
which
you
were
talking
about
then?
justice

black
those
are
the
three
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
on
your
rate
the
findings
of

commission.
you
have
on
your
16
cent
rate,
the
findings
of
the
commission
on
your
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
have
on
the
refund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
record
show
the
position
taken
by
the
parties
in
the
pending
price
as
fixing
permanent
rates
--
justice
hugo

black
--
by
16
or
15
or
what?
justice

black
that's
right.
justice

black
would
our
decisions
have
any
affect
on
that?
justice

black
but
the
ultimate
objective
of
its
finding
is
the
same.
what
if
there
is
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
that
means
rather
different
between
the
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
indicate
you
may
have
the
whole
thing
up
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
understood
precisely
what
you've
meant
by
the
figures
here.
you're
talking
about
take-or-pay
and
so
did
you
mean
by
that
that
they
have
not
spending
contracts
for
gas,
they
will
not
use
to
the
extended
$15
million?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
in
short,
as
i
understand
it,
whether
have
agreed
to
pay
this,
they
may
never
have
to
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
commissions
has
so
found
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
commission
found
they
would
not
have
to
pay
in
front
of
it
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
or
it
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
do
now?
are
you
defending
entirely
on
the
issue
retroactivity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposing
it
wasn't,
as
you
call
it
retroactive,
would
you
contest
their
power
to
order
refund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
--
do
you
claim
whatever
rate
they
say
that
in
fact,
changes
their
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
claim
here
is
that
whatever
manner
by
the
in-line
price?
they
read
on
these
certificates,
temporary
certificates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
bound
until
that's
changed
by
some
new
order
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
cannot
prospectively,
retroactively,
change
that
amount
in
that
certificate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
temporary
rate
was
confiscatory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
a
temporary
rate
was
confiscatory,
could
they
have
remedy
there
on
the
permanent
--
on
the
temporary
certificates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
prospective
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
relate
retroactively,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
that's
not
here
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
meant
that
it
was
fixed
and
inflexible
this
temporary
rate
even
though
it
was
confiscatory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
they
did,
no,
no,
you're
just
taking
your
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
argued
on
the
basis
that
someone
might
believe
what
that
order
as
said,
was
that
the
commission
was
without
power
to
do
that
even
if
it
wanted
to.
and
it
wouldn't
do
it
even
if
it
has
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
say
that's
the
way
it
looks
to
me
like,
what
they
said.
what
then
would
you
say
about
the
effect
of
that
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
it
and
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
should
hold
what
it
said
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
the
commission
was
wrong
without
its
power.
and
that
it
construed
the
statute
improperly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
changed
it,
would
it
not,
if
they
were
right
and
as
we're
saying,
and
i
think
they
did,
that
they
will
with
that
power
to
do
this
and
they
wouldn't
do
it
if
they
could
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
defend
it,
do
you,
if
you
think
it
was
a
wrong
construction
of
the
statute?
or
are
you
defending
it
even
though
it
was
a
wrong
construction
to
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
those
conditions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
it
has
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
under
those
conditions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
that
this
order
was
after
these
particular
certificates
here
were
issued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
say,
therefore,
i
assume
that
the
certificates
hold
it
didn't
have
the
right
to
rely
on
that
so
that
it
would
be
breaking
face
with
them.
that
was
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thus
the
commission
specifically
overruled
or
repudiated
this
february
5th
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
done
in
an
opinion?
