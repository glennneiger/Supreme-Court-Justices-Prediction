mr.
justin
r.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
texas
who
is
the
main
respondent
in
number
80.
we
concern
ourselves
and
address
ourselves
solely
to
the
question
of
refunds.
i
think
it
is
clear
at
least
we
argue
that
when
the
commission
issued
a
temporary
certificate
to
standard
fixing
and
prescribing
a
temporary
rate
of
18
cents,
and
this
was
done
in
standard's
case
after
the
guideline
policy
statement
had
been
issued.
and
it
was
a
temporary
certificate
which
prescribed
an
18-cent
rate
that
cause
standard
to
reduce
rates
it
had
contracted
to
receive.
the
commission
was
acting
at
that
time
in
a
legislative
or
a
quasi-legislative
capacity.
its
action
bounds
standard
for
the
future
until
that
action
was
changed.
if
the
rate
thus
prescribed
was
by
its
terms
that
is
by
the
quasi-legislative
after
the
commission
at
that
time,
made
subject
to
refund,
then
we
do
not
argue
that
a
later
refund
ordered
by
the
commission
would
be
improper
or
invalid.
and
i
think
that
this
is
exactly
what
my
friend,
mr.
coleman,
and
my
friend
mr.
schiff
are
arguing.
they
are
saying
that
the
so-called
“without
prejudice
language”
in
standard's
temporary
certificates
in
effect
said,
that
the
temporary
rate
was
to
be
18
cents
until
a
hearing
on
final
certificate
at
which
time
when
the
commission
prescribed
an
in-line
price
a
refund
from
the
18-cent
rate
would
have
to
be
paid
down
to
the
rate
fixed
as
the
in-line
price.
now,
one
of
standard's
temporary
certificates
particularly
the
one
appearing
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
108
and
109
says,
“this
is
without
prejudice
to
such
final
determination
of
the
application
for
the
certificate
as
the
record
may
require.”
the
other
temporary
that
standard
received
provides,
and
this
is
at
the
joint
appendix
100,
101,
“this
authorization
and
the
acceptance
of
the
above
rate
schedule
are
without
prejudice
to
such
final
disposition
of
the
application
for
certificate
as
the
record
may
require.”
so
the
issue
becomes
how
does
one
reads
it
without
prejudice
language.
that
question,
mr.
justice
fortas
which
i
think
you
recently
addressed
yourself.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
this
is
a
temporary
certification
to
the
sunray
oil
company,
yes
sir,
in
docket
ci
61,
657.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
it
is
correct
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
do
not
know,
sir.
i
suspect
--
i
suspect
that
it
is
a
choice
of
language
which
the
drafter
of
the
temporary
certificate
may
have
used
but
significantly
i
suggest
you
that
the
language
makes
no
difference.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
contend
that
the
temporary
certificate
that
was
issued
to
my
client
prescribed
that
18-cent
rate
until
it
could
and
would
be
changed
prospectively.
i
challenge
the
commission's
authority
to
change
it
retroactively.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
no
sir,
respectfully
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
the
commission
in
its
order
of
february
5th,
1963
has
specifically
unequipped
stated
exactly
what
it
meant
in
temporary
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
that
is
right.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
regret
that
i
do
not
appear
to
becoming
too
clear
to
you
as
i
hope
i
would.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
irrespective
of
the
language
used
in
the
respective
temporaries,
and
particularly
in
the
light
of
what
the
commission
said
with
regard
to
the
language
that
it
did
use
in
its
february
5
order.
the
commission
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
did
not
intend
to.
it
would
not
order
refunds
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
--
retroactively
reduced
the
rates
prescribed
by
the
ordering
of
refund.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
think
that
latter
you
said,
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
correct.
and
the
significance
of
the
argument
that
standard
of
texas
wishes
to
present
to
you,
is
that
what
we
are
saying
is
clearly
and
wholly
inline
with
the
decisions
that
had
been
articulated
by
this
court.
in
arizona
grocery,
in
284
u.s.,
you
said,
that
a
quasi-legislative
body
and
that
is
just
the
icc
could
not
retroactively
repeal
its
own
enactment.
and
we
agree
with
that.
we
say
that
what
the
commission
is
attempted
to
do
in
its
opinion
501
is
retroactively
to
repeal
its
whole
enactment.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
exactly,
your
honor,
you
have
phrased
it
better
than
i.
in
fact,
i
should
quit
at
that
point.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
i
will.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
yes,
sir.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
do
not
so
argue
with
that
justice
white,
nor
do
i
understand
that
that
argu
--
that
the
argument
which
you
have
just
articulated
has
been
set
forth
in
any
of
the
other
briefs.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
if
there
is
to
be
a
refund
and
i
sincerely
trust
there
will
not
be
because
it
would
be
retroactive
rate
measure.
and
the
measure
is
the
measure
which
the
commission
has
prescribed,
the
difference
between
the
rates
prescribed
in
the
temporary
certificate
on
the
in-line.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
no,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
in
the
circumstances
of
callery,
they
did
exactly
what
you
say,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
but
after
the
non-final
permanent
certificates
had
been
vacated
by
this
court's
decision
in
catco.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
am
saying
that
if
the
commission
prescribes
a
rate
in
a
temporary
certificate,
it
does
not
provide
--
and
--
and
provides
that
it
can
be
changed
in
the
future
prospectively
that
the
producer
provided
(voice
overlap)
to
keep
those
dollars.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
no,
sir.
but
they
provided
in
the
october
5th,
in
the
february
5th
order
they
said
that's
exactly
what
they
did
in
this
case.
i'm
not
in
callery,
if
it
may
--
if
it
may
please,
your
honor.
i
am
in
this
case
dealing
with
exactly
what
they
said
in
date
of
effect
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
think
i
would
be
here
on
any
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
retroactively,
yes
sir.
yes,
yes,
i
would
make
that
argument
with
or
without
the
february
5th
order.
mr.
justin
r.
wolf
i
don't
read
callery
as
at
least,
i
may
not
if
i
don't
read
it.
i
certainly
don't
understand
callery
in
the
way
that
you
have
just
articulated
callery.
i
have
to
not
hold
to
the
fact
that
it's
one
of
your
opinions
without
mine
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
i
did
not
read
it
that
way.
