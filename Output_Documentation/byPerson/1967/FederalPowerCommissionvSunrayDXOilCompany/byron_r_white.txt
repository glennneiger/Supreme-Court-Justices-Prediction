justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
schiff,
before
that,
had
the
commission
actually
denied
a
--
some
sort
of
a
request
from
distributor
groups
to
alter
the
temporary
certificates
to
provide
for
the
refund
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
very
case
--
in
these
--
on
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
would
you
--
would
you
suggest
that
--
or
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
issue
a
temporary
certificate
without
the
obligation
for
refund?
let's
assume
the
circuit
here
said
it
expressly
there
should
be
no
obligation
to
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
really
what
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
is
that
the
commission
saying,
“we
refused
to
modify
these
certificates
to
provide
for
an
expressed
--
to
expressly
provide
for
refund
because
we
don't
think
it
would
--
we
don't
intend
to
have
and
make
a
refund”,
that
what
they've
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
that
by
--
with
these
temporary
certificates,
we
haven't
--
we
have
not
intended
and
don't
intend
to
require
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
you
don't
suggest
that
the
commission
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
who
didn't
--
haven't
had
notice
came
in
and
asked
that
they
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
i
gather
then
the
commission's
views
of
whether
it's
equitable
or
not
had
changed
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
some
help
from
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
reserve
some
power
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
put
a
condition
on
subject
to
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
of
just
and
reasonable
--
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
stick
to
16
cents.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schiff,
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
do
have
area
rates
as
a
point
of
reference?
you
suggested
awhile
ago
that
your
in-line
price
should
probably
be
the
just
and
reasonable
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
all
the
--
when
all
the
area
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
all
the
area
rates
are
finally
set
or
had
been
set
at
least
initially,
will
this
problem
arise
again
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they'll
have
to
be
a
redetermination
of
the
just
and
reasonableness
before
the
in-line
price
is
going
to
go
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
and
if
their
temporary
certificates
--
they
will
just
continue
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
express.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
these
cases,
you
were
discussing
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
--
if
you're
staying
in
this
--
in
setting
these
particular
in-lines
prices,
and
then
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
were
established
in
an
area
proceeding,
and
those
just
and
reasonable
are
lower
than
the
in-line
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
does
mine.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
with
these
--
with
these
initial
prices
under
the
temporary
certificate
guideline
pricing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
had
set
the
guideline
prices
for
initial
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
have
suggested
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
i
asked
earlier
was
--
if
the
permission
in
this
case
had
said
in
its
certificate,
these
initial
prices
shall
not
be
subject
to
refund.
my
question
was
whether
the
commission
had
the
power
to
say
--
not
only
to
say
that
but
to
act
in
accordance
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
don't
you
--
don't
you
really
just
about
you
have
to
get
to
that
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
commission
has
--
has
turned
down
a
request
to
expressly
condition
the
temporary
on
refunds?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
coleman,
at
what
price
is
it
does
the
producers
has
been
selling
gas
since
the
in-line
price
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
in-line?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
in-line
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
set
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
--
if
they
had
done
--
if
they
hadn't
been
selling
at
the
in-line
price,
but
it
was
determined
in
this
proceeding,
that
the
in-line
price
was
set
to
high,
then
under
callery,
they
would
have
to
make
a
refund
back
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
which
there
has
been
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you're
claiming
for
example,
in-line
price
that
was
set
is
too
high.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let
assume
you
won
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
then
that
--
and
the
producers
had
been
charging
the
higher
in-line
price
meanwhile,
there
would
be
a
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
--
under
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
the
commission
always
finds
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
the
issuance
of
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
know
that
it
did
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
same
time
it
said
that
we
think
the
issue
of
need,
however,
should
be
confined
to
pipeline
cases
because
of
the
need
for
the
pipelines
to
range
for
advanced
supply
of
gas.
now,
you
just
differ
with
--
you
don't
think
without
considering
need
they
could
find
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
disagrees
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
just
disagrees
with
you
on
the
construction
of
public
convenience
and
necessities.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
commission
have
some
kind
of
proceeding
going
on
take-or-pay
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
must
feel
that
as
a
practical
matter
necessary
to
contract
to
hit
for
gas
and
arrange
for
just
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
future.
and
i
don't
suppose
that
gas
companies
just
thoughtlessly
make
improvident
purchases
of
gas
that
could
cost
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
dollars.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
things
that
you
say
just
one
more
--
if
you
--
if
you
would
prevail,
it
would
mean
that
the
inquiry
or
need
must
consider
the
pipeline
situation
as
a
whole.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
every
producer
certificate
hearing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
only
would
be
dealing
with
the
--
the
specific
quantity
of
gas
but
the
pipeline's
total
overall
situation
in
each
in
the
markets
that
it
serves.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
does
expand
this
hearing
into
a
major
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
--
don't
we
just
about
have
to
get
that
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
just
about
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
the
petition
turned
down
a
request
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may.
mr.
tell.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
this
area
rate
proceeding
started
in
the
texas
gulf
coast?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
not
been
concluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
with
those
prices
above
--
what
is
exactly
--
what
was
the
in-line
price
that
he
had
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
there
would
be
refunds
i
suppose
if
the
fair
and
reasonable
price
is
that
in
the
area
of
proceeding
is
below
the
in-line
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
in-line
happens
to
be
above
--
be
above
16,
there's
nothing
to
do
about
the
interim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
the
--
did
the
permission
limit
your
ability
under
this
permanent
certificate
to
file
increase
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
--
you
could
go
up
immediately
to
18
cents
assuming
your
contracts
permitted
you
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
for
15,
you
could
file
--
you
could
make
filings
to
take
up
to
18?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
that
the
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
why
right
after
this
commission's
order,
you
couldn't
have
filed
an
increase
rate
up
to
18
cents?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
have
been
--
that
might
have
been
suspended
for
a
few
months
but
then
it
would
have
gone
into
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
it
isn't
raised?
justice
byron
r.
white
limited
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
argued?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
that
affect
these
dockets?
is
it
already
--
isn't
these
certificates
are
already
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
commission
may
not
consider
anything
but
permanent
certificate
pricing?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
--
but
even
if
we
considered
all
the
outstanding
permanent
certificates,
you
would
say
they're
also
to
consider
some
temporary
certificates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
there
are
10
permanent
certificates
that
could
give
you
a
price
of
an
18.
and
there
are
some
other
evidence
on
what
current
market
prices
are
that
would
reduce
to
17.
you
would
say
it
would
stick
with
this
--with
the
permanent
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
like
the
distributors
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
would
lower
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
evidence
is
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
february
5th
order?
is
it
cited
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
this
is
the
last
one
on
your
side,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
part
of
your
objection
to
the
refund
order
here
go
to
saying
that
the
in-line
rate
is
not
a
proper
measure
of
the
refund
if
the
refund
is
what
we
had
but
that
the
refund
obligations
should
be
measured
by
what
ultimately
is
forthcoming
in
the
area
rate
proceedings
about
fair
and
reasonable
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
in-line
rate
is
set
by
the
commission
if
there
is
to
be
a
refund.
you
concede
that
it's
a
fair
measure
of
what
the
refund
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
argument
necessarily
mean
that
callery
was
really
wrong
insofar
as
they
decided
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
callery
though,
here's
a
commission
that
in
the
--
in
a
section
7
of
the
proceeding
sets
a
rate.
it
determines
a
rate.
and
that
company
goes
ahead
and
charges
that
rate.
and
it
just
so
happens
the
rate
isn't
final.
but
the
commission
has
said
it
is,
that
the
rate
isn't
final
and
gets
reversed
on
appeal.
and
if
there's
a
refund
there,
isn't
the
--
the
commission
may
order
a
refund.
in
fact,
it
has
to,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
touch
time
with
that
case
and
that
suggests
that
the
temporary
certificate
which
sets
a
rate
is
a
less
--
is
a
more
formal,
a
more
reliable,
a
more
final
sort
of
a
thing
than
an
in-line
rate
that's
set
in
section
7
proceeding
after
a
hearing.
and
even
if
the
producer
goes
ahead
and
charges
that
rate,
set
at
us
and
--
charges
the
in-line
rate
that
he's
told
to
charge
by
the
commission,
he
nevertheless
has
to
refund
if
this
happens
to
get
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
didn't
provide
anything
like
that
in
callery.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
you
mean
without
--
without
the
february
5th
order
having
been
in
review,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
oh!
i'm
sure
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
the
same
argument
except
without
the
february
5th
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
that
--
you
would
still
say
that
the
temporary
rate
set
by
the
commission
was
a
legislative
act
that
couldn't
be
changed
through
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
--
what
do
you
think
about
the
in-line
price
though?
why
does
the
company
have
to
refund
whatever
rate
that
it's
been
charging
which
the
commissioner
set
after
an
in-line
price
hearing.callery
said
it
had
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
ordered
to
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schiff,
if
the
in-line
price
here
is
determined
to
have
been
set
too
high,
it's
15
rather
than
16.
and
if
the
companies
had
been
charging
that
higher
in-line
price
at
16,
and
then
the
order
is
reversed
and
that
it
said
that
it
should
be
15,
what
authority
is
there
for
saying
there
would
have
to
be
a
refund
in
that
situation?
is
that
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
in
callery,
the
original
--
the
rate
or
the
part
of
which
was
refunded
really
wasn't
set
by
the
commission,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in-line
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
was
significant
in
callery
that
the
--
that
that
was
a
permanent
certificate
and
a
rate
under
a
permanent
certificate,
i
suppose.
but
the
commission
didn't
specify
that
original
rate
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
might
(voice
overlap)
in
issuing
the
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there
is
a
proper
condition
in
the
permanent
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
aren't
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
no
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
callery,
the
callery
case
itself
said
that
the
fixing
of
an
initial
in-line
prices
establishes
a
firm
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
a
producer
may
operate
without
any
contingent
liability
to
make
refunds.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
is
just
a
reasonable
rate
to
have
it
be
lowered
than
the
in-line
price.
and
one
of
the
reasons
given
was
the
commission
didn't
have
any
reparation
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
schiff,
before
that,
had
the
commission
actually
denied
a
--
some
sort
of
a
request
from
distributor
groups
to
alter
the
temporary
certificates
to
provide
for
the
refund
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
very
case
--
in
these
--
on
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
would
you
--
would
you
suggest
that
--
or
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
issue
a
temporary
certificate
without
the
obligation
for
refund?
let's
assume
the
circuit
here
said
it
expressly
there
should
be
no
obligation
to
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
really
what
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
is
that
the
commission
saying,
“we
refused
to
modify
these
certificates
to
provide
for
an
expressed
--
to
expressly
provide
for
refund
because
we
don't
think
it
would
--
we
don't
intend
to
have
and
make
a
refund”,
that
what
they've
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
that
by
--
with
these
temporary
certificates,
we
haven't
--
we
have
not
intended
and
don't
intend
to
require
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
you
don't
suggest
that
the
commission
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
who
didn't
--
haven't
had
notice
came
in
and
asked
that
they
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
i
gather
then
the
commission's
views
of
whether
it's
equitable
or
not
had
changed
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
some
help
from
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
reserve
some
power
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
put
a
condition
on
subject
to
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
of
just
and
reasonable
--
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
stick
to
16
cents.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schiff,
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
do
have
area
rates
as
a
point
of
reference?
you
suggested
awhile
ago
that
your
in-line
price
should
probably
be
the
just
and
reasonable
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
all
the
--
when
all
the
area
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
all
the
area
rates
are
finally
set
or
had
been
set
at
least
initially,
will
this
problem
arise
again
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they'll
have
to
be
a
redetermination
of
the
just
and
reasonableness
before
the
in-line
price
is
going
to
go
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
and
if
their
temporary
certificates
--
they
will
just
continue
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
express.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
these
cases,
you
were
discussing
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
--
if
you're
staying
in
this
--
in
setting
these
particular
in-lines
prices,
and
then
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
were
established
in
an
area
proceeding,
and
those
just
and
reasonable
are
lower
than
the
in-line
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
does
mine.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
with
these
--
with
these
initial
prices
under
the
temporary
certificate
guideline
pricing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
had
set
the
guideline
prices
for
initial
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
have
suggested
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
i
asked
earlier
was
--
if
the
permission
in
this
case
had
said
in
its
certificate,
these
initial
prices
shall
not
be
subject
to
refund.
my
question
was
whether
the
commission
had
the
power
to
say
--
not
only
to
say
that
but
to
act
in
accordance
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
don't
you
--
don't
you
really
just
about
you
have
to
get
to
that
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
commission
has
--
has
turned
down
a
request
to
expressly
condition
the
temporary
on
refunds?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
coleman,
at
what
price
is
it
does
the
producers
has
been
selling
gas
since
the
in-line
price
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
in-line?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
in-line
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
set
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
--
if
they
had
done
--
if
they
hadn't
been
selling
at
the
in-line
price,
but
it
was
determined
in
this
proceeding,
that
the
in-line
price
was
set
to
high,
then
under
callery,
they
would
have
to
make
a
refund
back
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
which
there
has
been
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you're
claiming
for
example,
in-line
price
that
was
set
is
too
high.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let
assume
you
won
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
then
that
--
and
the
producers
had
been
charging
the
higher
in-line
price
meanwhile,
there
would
be
a
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
--
under
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
the
commission
always
finds
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
the
issuance
of
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
know
that
it
did
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
same
time
it
said
that
we
think
the
issue
of
need,
however,
should
be
confined
to
pipeline
cases
because
of
the
need
for
the
pipelines
to
range
for
advanced
supply
of
gas.
now,
you
just
differ
with
--
you
don't
think
without
considering
need
they
could
find
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
disagrees
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
just
disagrees
with
you
on
the
construction
of
public
convenience
and
necessities.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
commission
have
some
kind
of
proceeding
going
on
take-or-pay
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
must
feel
that
as
a
practical
matter
necessary
to
contract
to
hit
for
gas
and
arrange
for
just
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
future.
and
i
don't
suppose
that
gas
companies
just
thoughtlessly
make
improvident
purchases
of
gas
that
could
cost
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
dollars.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
things
that
you
say
just
one
more
--
if
you
--
if
you
would
prevail,
it
would
mean
that
the
inquiry
or
need
must
consider
the
pipeline
situation
as
a
whole.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
every
producer
certificate
hearing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
only
would
be
dealing
with
the
--
the
specific
quantity
of
gas
but
the
pipeline's
total
overall
situation
in
each
in
the
markets
that
it
serves.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
does
expand
this
hearing
into
a
major
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
--
don't
we
just
about
have
to
get
that
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
just
about
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
the
petition
turned
down
a
request
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may.
mr.
tell.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
this
area
rate
proceeding
started
in
the
texas
gulf
coast?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
not
been
concluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
with
those
prices
above
--
what
is
exactly
--
what
was
the
in-line
price
that
he
had
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
there
would
be
refunds
i
suppose
if
the
fair
and
reasonable
price
is
that
in
the
area
of
proceeding
is
below
the
in-line
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
in-line
happens
to
be
above
--
be
above
16,
there's
nothing
to
do
about
the
interim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
the
--
did
the
permission
limit
your
ability
under
this
permanent
certificate
to
file
increase
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
--
you
could
go
up
immediately
to
18
cents
assuming
your
contracts
permitted
you
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
for
15,
you
could
file
--
you
could
make
filings
to
take
up
to
18?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
that
the
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
why
right
after
this
commission's
order,
you
couldn't
have
filed
an
increase
rate
up
to
18
cents?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
have
been
--
that
might
have
been
suspended
for
a
few
months
but
then
it
would
have
gone
into
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
it
isn't
raised?
justice
byron
r.
white
limited
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
argued?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
that
affect
these
dockets?
is
it
already
--
isn't
these
certificates
are
already
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
commission
may
not
consider
anything
but
permanent
certificate
pricing?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
--
but
even
if
we
considered
all
the
outstanding
permanent
certificates,
you
would
say
they're
also
to
consider
some
temporary
certificates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
there
are
10
permanent
certificates
that
could
give
you
a
price
of
an
18.
and
there
are
some
other
evidence
on
what
current
market
prices
are
that
would
reduce
to
17.
you
would
say
it
would
stick
with
this
--with
the
permanent
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
like
the
distributors
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
would
lower
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
evidence
is
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
february
5th
order?
is
it
cited
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
this
is
the
last
one
on
your
side,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
part
of
your
objection
to
the
refund
order
here
go
to
saying
that
the
in-line
rate
is
not
a
proper
measure
of
the
refund
if
the
refund
is
what
we
had
but
that
the
refund
obligations
should
be
measured
by
what
ultimately
is
forthcoming
in
the
area
rate
proceedings
about
fair
and
reasonable
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
in-line
rate
is
set
by
the
commission
if
there
is
to
be
a
refund.
you
concede
that
it's
a
fair
measure
of
what
the
refund
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
argument
necessarily
mean
that
callery
was
really
wrong
insofar
as
they
decided
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
callery
though,
here's
a
commission
that
in
the
--
in
a
section
7
of
the
proceeding
sets
a
rate.
it
determines
a
rate.
and
that
company
goes
ahead
and
charges
that
rate.
and
it
just
so
happens
the
rate
isn't
final.
but
the
commission
has
said
it
is,
that
the
rate
isn't
final
and
gets
reversed
on
appeal.
and
if
there's
a
refund
there,
isn't
the
--
the
commission
may
order
a
refund.
in
fact,
it
has
to,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
touch
time
with
that
case
and
that
suggests
that
the
temporary
certificate
which
sets
a
rate
is
a
less
--
is
a
more
formal,
a
more
reliable,
a
more
final
sort
of
a
thing
than
an
in-line
rate
that's
set
in
section
7
proceeding
after
a
hearing.
and
even
if
the
producer
goes
ahead
and
charges
that
rate,
set
at
us
and
--
charges
the
in-line
rate
that
he's
told
to
charge
by
the
commission,
he
nevertheless
has
to
refund
if
this
happens
to
get
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
didn't
provide
anything
like
that
in
callery.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
you
mean
without
--
without
the
february
5th
order
having
been
in
review,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
oh!
i'm
sure
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
the
same
argument
except
without
the
february
5th
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
that
--
you
would
still
say
that
the
temporary
rate
set
by
the
commission
was
a
legislative
act
that
couldn't
be
changed
through
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
--
what
do
you
think
about
the
in-line
price
though?
why
does
the
company
have
to
refund
whatever
rate
that
it's
been
charging
which
the
commissioner
set
after
an
in-line
price
hearing.callery
said
it
had
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
ordered
to
refund.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schiff,
if
the
in-line
price
here
is
determined
to
have
been
set
too
high,
it's
15
rather
than
16.
and
if
the
companies
had
been
charging
that
higher
in-line
price
at
16,
and
then
the
order
is
reversed
and
that
it
said
that
it
should
be
15,
what
authority
is
there
for
saying
there
would
have
to
be
a
refund
in
that
situation?
is
that
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
in
callery,
the
original
--
the
rate
or
the
part
of
which
was
refunded
really
wasn't
set
by
the
commission,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in-line
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
was
significant
in
callery
that
the
--
that
that
was
a
permanent
certificate
and
a
rate
under
a
permanent
certificate,
i
suppose.
but
the
commission
didn't
specify
that
original
rate
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
might
(voice
overlap)
in
issuing
the
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
callery?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there
is
a
proper
condition
in
the
permanent
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
aren't
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
no
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
callery,
the
callery
case
itself
said
that
the
fixing
of
an
initial
in-line
prices
establishes
a
firm
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
a
producer
may
operate
without
any
contingent
liability
to
make
refunds.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
is
just
a
reasonable
rate
to
have
it
be
lowered
than
the
in-line
price.
and
one
of
the
reasons
given
was
the
commission
didn't
have
any
reparation
power.
