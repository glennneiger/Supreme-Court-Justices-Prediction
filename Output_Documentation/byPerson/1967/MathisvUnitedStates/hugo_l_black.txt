what
do
you
mean
by
the
consequence
of
it?
justice

did
he
give
him
any
kind
of
warning?
justice

he
hadn't
arrived
at
the
criminal
stages
yet.

the

stage
did

a
result
of

they
didn't
discard
or
throw
away
that
which
he
had
given
him,
did
they?

not
that
be
enough

require

a
man
that
might
be
used
against
him.

it's
an
inseparable
part
of
a
process
that
frequently
leads
to
criminal
prosecution
and
that's
intended
to
be
used
and
rightfully
so,
is
it
not,
if
it's
required,
that
they
do
find

guilty

i
guess
your
main
difference
here
--
your
real
point
is,
miranda
held
where
a
man
was
in
jail
or
in
custody,
in
connection
with
something
and
they
went
in
and
asked
him
questions,
that
custody
was
enough
to
make
it
coercive.
your
question
is
whether
that
would
define
when
he
was
in
jail
on
another
charge.
