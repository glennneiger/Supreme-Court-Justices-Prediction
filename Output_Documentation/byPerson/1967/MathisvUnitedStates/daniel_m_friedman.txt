mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
course
prohibits
only
involuntary
incriminating
statements.
it
speaks
of,
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
give
testimony.”
voluntary
admissions,
even
if
made
to
a
government
investigating
agent,
even
if
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation,
which
is
i'll
come
to
briefly
this
was
not,
are
not
inadmissible
as
obtained
under
the
fifth
amendment,
if
an
admission
is
made
voluntarily.
now,
this
court
in
its
miranda
decision
concluded
that
because
of
the
experience
in
this
country
with
police
interrogation,
the
circumstances
under
which
experience
have
shown
the
police
interrogate
prisoners
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
special
protections
to
insure
that
in
the
case
of
interrogation
by
the
police
in
the
stationhouse,
that
would
appear
to
be
a
voluntary
admission
was
in
fact
voluntary.
that
is
additional
protections
were
made
necessary
because
of
the
experience
showing
that
has
conducted
in
this
country.
interrogation
of
a
man
who
had
been
taken
into
the
police
station
in
an
inherently
compelling
effect
of
itself,
that
is
the
mere
circumstances
as
shown
in
the
police
manuals,
the
psychological
pressures,
the
tricks,
the
situations
that
were
arranged
by
the
police
in
questioning
a
man.
this
itself
raised
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
when
a
man
did
speak
to
the
police
when
he
did
make
incriminating
admissions,
whether
this
really
was
the
result
of
free
choice
on
his
part.
and
therefore,
this
court
said
that
because
of
these
situations,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
privilege,
in
order
to
be
sure
that
when
a
man
speaks
after
he
had
been
interrogated
at
the
police
station,
after
he
had
been
taken
away
from
his
home,
certain
additional
protections
were
necessary.
how
to
be
specifically
won,
precisely
what
his
constitutional
rights
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
a
rather
broad
language
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
considerations
that
led
this
court
to
reach
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
interrogation
by
the
custodians.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
interrogators,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
i
said,
“or
any
other
place
where”
--
i
would
--
let
me
say,
mr.
justice,
what
you
have
in
a
case
is
that
a
man
is
in
prison
and
the
warden
calls
the
man
and
they
start
interrogating,
i
think
would
be
a
very
different
kind
of
situation.
but
that
it
seems
to
us
is
not
this
situation
and
our
point
is
that
there's
no
comparable
experience
to
show
that
the
mere
fact
questions
put
to
a
man
while
he
is
in
jail
by
someone
else
that
that
fact
is
sufficient
to
require
these
protections
in
every
case.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
ordinarily
not,
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
should
not
be.
i
would
not
think
so.
it
may
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
to
may
knowledge.
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
can
answer,
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
obviously
speak
and
say
that
there
may
not
be
a
case
when
a
particular
revenue
agent,
as
a
result
of
something
that
happens
in
his
interview
with
the
taxpayer
recommends
a
jeopardy
and
i
can
say
that
the
general
practice
is
that
the
refusal
of
a
taxpayer
to
talk
to
an
agent
does
not
affect
the
penalties
of
jeopardy
assessment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
check
--
mr.
justice,
when
i
get
back,
i
would
check
it
with
the
service
and
if
anything
i've
said
is
inaccurate,
we
will
of
course
correct
it
in
a
letter
to
the
clerk.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but,
i
want
to
mention
of
course
that
if
a
man
refuses
to
talk
to
a
revenue
agent
then
there
are
procedures.
they
can
serve
a
summons
upon
him
and
call
him
to
testify.
now,
we
think
that
in
situation
where
interrogation
takes
place,
when
someone
is
in
the
penitentiary
that
this
court
should
not
extend
the
miranda
principle
to
say
that
in
every
such
instance,
automatically,
the
warning
should
be
given
because
we
don't
think
there's
any
basis
in
our
experience
to
conclude
that
the
same
evils
that
were
present
in
the
police
station
interrogation
or
the
custodial
interrogation
of
the
type
involved
in
miranda
exists
here.
and
we
therefore
suggest
that
the
appropriate
standard
in
dealing
with
this
type
of
interrogation
is
the
same
standard
this
court
has
traditionally
applied
in
considering
the
voluntariness
of
confessions.
that
is
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstance.
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
we
attempt
to
decide
whether
in
fact
there
is
anything
here
to
suggest
that
the
admissions
made
by
the
particular
individual
does
not
represents
a
free
and
voluntary
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn't
think
that
in
terms
of
my
argument
would
make
any
difference
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
not
make
any
difference
but
i
don't
have
to
take
that
argument
on.
i
don't
think
because
we
say
that
this
record
does
not
indicate
this
was
a
criminal
investigation
at
all.
we
think
that
this
was
clearly
a
civil
investigation.
i'd
like
to
give
a
little
more
now
on
the
way
of
background
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
our
argument,
that's
right.
because
if
i
may
explain,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
the
service,
the
organization
of
the
service
how
the
service
conducts
these
investigations.
ordinarily,
an
investigation
such
as
was
made
by
internal
revenue
agent
lawless
is
considered
to
call
an
audit
and
the
only
function
of
a
man
making
an
audit
is
to
determine
whether
the
tax
return
accurately
reflects
the
tax
reported.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
another
branch
known
as
the
intelligence
division.
and
it's
the
intelligence
division
has
charge
of
investigating
possibilities
of
criminal
tax
fraud.
mr.
lawless
testified
that
his
sole
job
in
this
case
was
to
investigate
the
civil
tax
returns.
he
explained.
he
said,
all
he
was
attempting
to
do
is
to
determine
the
correct
tax
on
these
returns.
he
himself
unequivocally
testified
that
he
was
not
making
any
criminal
investigations.
he
also
testified
that
--
at
page
37
of
the
record
--
that
if
he
discovered
that
there
were
definite
indications
of
fraud,
his
duty
was
to
turn
the
matter
over
to
the
intelligence
division.
now,
mr.
lawless
made
two
visits
to
the
petitioner
in
the
florida
penitentiary.
his
first
visit
was
made
at
the
end
of
october
1964.
prior
to
that
time,
and
the
record
does
not
show
the
circumstances
under
which
it
taken
place,
the
petitioner
had
already
granted
one
extension
of
time
for
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
assessment
of
any
additional
tax
against
him
or
corresponding
we
would
also
extend
his
time
for
refund.
that
extension
was
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
december
and
agent
lawless
testified
that
when
he
went
to
the
penitentiary,
to
see
the
petitioner
at
the
end
of
october,
he
said
his
visit
had
two
purposes.
he
said,
first
of
all,
he
wanted
to
determine
whether
the
returns
that
were
assigned
to
him
for
audit
were
the
returns
of
the
petitioner
and
secondly,
to
get
an
extension
of
time
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
what
agent
lawless
did,
he
came
in
and
said
to
the
man
he
held
up
his
return
which
he
had
for
1960
and
said,
“is
ths
your
return?”
the
man
said,
“yes”
and
he
said,
“is
this
your
signature?”
and
he
said
“yes”.
this
seems
to
us
a
normal
question
to
be
asked
when
an
agent
is
investigating
someone's
civil
tax
return.
the
first
thing
he
wants
to
know
if
he's
sure
he's
got
the
right
man.
then
the
second
thing
he
did
was
in
effect
ask
him,
we
asked
him,
again
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitation,
something
that
petitioner
had
done
previously.
he
testified
that
he
explained
to
the
petitioner
that
he
had
no
obligation
to
sign
this,
that
was
up
him
to
explain
the
consequences
of
it
and
the
petitioner
signed
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
consequence
of
signing
a
return
would
be,
on
the
one
hand
the
government's
time
for
assessing
an
additional
tax,
statute
of
limitation
would
be
extended
and
at
the
same
time,
it
would
extend
the
taxpayer's
time
within
which
he
could
make
a
claim
for
refund.
so
that's
in
effect
a
mutual
arrangement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
gave
him
no
warning
in
the
constitutional
sense
because,
mr.
justice,
he
was
not
at
that
time
making
a
criminal
tax
investigation.
he
was
just
seeking
an
extension
for
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
you
said
he
hadn't
arrived
at
the
criminal
stage
it
was
far
from
the
criminal
stage.
this
witness
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
criminal
stage
came
on
about
seven
or
eight
months.
well,
seven
or
at
six
or
seven
or
five
months
later,
the
matter
was
assigned
to
--
was
transferred
by
agent
lawless
to
the
intelligence
division.
it
was
some
three
or
four
months
after
that
the
indictment
was
actually
returned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
result,
mr.
justice
of
an
investigation
by
the
intelligence
division.
i
think
it's
significant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
not,
mr.
justice,
but
at
that
point,
lawless
testified
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
criminal
investigation.
the
judge
at
one
point
said
then
well
that
possibility
exists
whenever
you
have
an
income
tax
investigation,
whenever
anyone's
return
is
ordered,
one
never
knows
what
may
turn
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
that
would
not
be
enough,
mr.
justice
because
i
think
that
is
just
--
at
that
point
there
is
no
overreaching
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
at
that
early
stage
of
the
proceeding,
the
thing
hadn't
really
gotten
close
enough
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
internal
revenue
agents
look
at
a
case,
think
there
may
be
something
suggesting
fraud
and
end
up
not
making
a
reference.
there
are
many
more
instances
where
a
case
is
referred
to
the
intelligence
division
and
yet
nothing
eventuates
from
it.
we
have
some
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
in
that
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
looking
to
see
what
the
facts
are
and
if
anything
develops
which
may
lead
to
an
indication
of
fraud,
it's
their
duty
to
turn
it
over
to
the
intelligence
division.
but
they
are
not
looking
for
fraud
in
the
same
sense
for
example
that
a
detective
who
was
going
out
seeking
to
solve
a
crime.
they
are
not
attempting
--
the
whole
purpose
of
a
civil
tax
investigation
is
not
to
gather
evidence,
not
to
discover
fraud
or
crime.
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
ascertain
whether
the
return
is
correct
or
whether
there
is
additional
tax
own.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
this
is
not
part
of
the
plot
or
the
scheme
by
the
government
to
use
a
civil
tax
investigated
to
try
to
get
evidence
of
fraud.
now,
the
nature
of
our
tax
laws
as
such
that
there
are
situations
where
in
the
course
of
a
civil
tax
investigation
evidences
developed
which
ultimately
leads
to
a
criminal
prosecution
but
it
seems
to
us
the
mere
fact
that
that
evidence
begins
to
be
developed
at
a
point
when
the
civil
investigation
is
underway,
that's
not
enough
to
turn
it
into
a
criminal
type
of
proceeding
to
which
the
constitutional
protections
must
be
made
put
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
solely
a
civil
--
no,
i
understand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
understand
they
do
not,
mr.
justice.
the
practice
of
the
service
is,
the
warnings
are
given
only
when
a
special
agent
is
called
into
the
case.
that
is
when
the
matter
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
criminal
stage
and
then
they
do
give
them
a
warning
but
as
long
as
it
take
civil
investigation,
they
do
not
give
him
warning.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
make
it
--
under
two
elements
of
this
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
one
is
the
fact
that
at
this
stage
has
not
yet
reached
yet
the
criminal
stage.
it
was
a
possibility
only
in
the
sense
that
a
criminal
prosecution
is
possible
in
any
such
investigation.
the
other
thing
of
course,
it
seems
to
me,
which
i
think
it's
equally
significant,
is
that
in
this
case
there
were
present
--
none
of
the
overreaching,
none
of
the
kind
of
pressures
that
are
characteristically
associated
with
coercive
interrogation,
it
was
only
one
man.
they
didn't
have
a
team
come
in.
they
didn't
play
the
“mutt
and
jeff”
team,
there's
one
man.
but
there's
no
lengthy
questioning.
there
are
two
questions
that
were
asked.
there
was
no
trickery.
there
was
no
psychological
pressure.
there
was
no
setting
up
a
situation
under
which
the
man
would
be
feeling
impelled
to
talk.
this
man,
unlike
the
people
in
miranda
hadn't
been
dragged
or
swept
from
familiar
surroundings
in
the
police
custody.
by
the
time
he
was
interviewed
in
this
jail,
he'd
been
there
for
more
than
18
months.
there's
no
reason
for
this
man
to
think
that
because
he
cooperated
with
the
federal
officers
that
this
in
any
way
would
affect
him
in
his
state
situation,
either
he
would
get
him
out
of
the
state
jail,
that
it
would
make
shorten
his
sentence
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
plus
the
fact
that
in
miranda,
they
were
interviewing
the
man
in
an
attempt
to
get
him
to
make
admissions
about
a
crime
that
was
being
asked
to
examine
whereas
in
this
case,
the
man
was
not
being
interviewed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
which
he
had
been
arrested,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
two
aspects.
two
aspects
--
the
false
claim
for
a
refund,
turned
of
course
on
whether
he
should
turn
on
–
well
there
are
two
possibilities.
one,
the
question
whether
he
had
overstated
his
tax,
the
amount
of
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
mr.
justice,
if
he
had
correctly
reported
his
income
and
if
in
fact
the
six
or
seven
dependents
that
he
listed
on
each
of
these
returns,
i
pointed
out
that
each
of
these
years,
he
listed
six
or
seven
or
eight
dependents
and
with
one
exception,
they
all
had
different
names.
if
he
had
actually
received
this
money
and
if
these
dependents
were
fictitious,
then
of
course
there
was
an
additional
tax
owing.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
just
would
had
been
--
the
tax
may
have
been
more
than
what
was
reported
in
one
instance.
in
one
instance
in
fact,
which
is
government's
exhibit
2-a
shown
at
106
of
the
record,
his
own
calculations
were
in
error
and
the
record
shows
that
when
someone
look
at
this
in
the
internal
revenue
service,
they
crossed
off
the
amount
he
had
shown
as
the
tax
to
have
$931.00
recalculated
on
the
basis
of
what
he
showed
his
income
and
the
number
of
exemptions
and
concluded
that
instead
of
being
entitled
to
a
$900.00
refund,
he
had
another
$142.00
of
tax.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
on
my
remaining
time
to
the
contention
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
this
case
in
failing
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
what
i
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
we
don't
have
any
similar
experience
in
connection
with
questioning
people
who
are
in
the
jail
where
they're
held,
as
in
this
case,
by
another
authority
to
suggest
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
insist
on
a
rule
that
whenever
there
is
such
questioning,
whenever
a
man
is
questioned
and
he
is
in
jail,
that
automatically
the
warnings
need
be
given.
i
suggest
it
should
depend
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
may
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
any
empirical
basis
for
concluding
that
when
someone
comes
from
the
outside
to
ask
a
prisoner
two
questions
that
the
mere
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
two
questions,
two
questions.
but
this
is
not
a
case
of
prolonged
interrogation.
if
this
was
a
case
of
real
custodian
interrogation
of
overreaching,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
rule
should
be
any
different.
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
case
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
a
voluntary
admission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
explain
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
man
was
not
in
the
federal
prison.
this
man
is
in
the
state
prison.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
man
is
in
a
state
prison
serving
a
state
sentence
for
an
unrelated
offense
to
the
federal
offense.
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
pressures,
the
pressures
upon
this
man
to
speak
to
the
agent,
to
the
federal
agent
who
comes
in
to
talk
to
him,
i
suggest
the
pressures
are
not
necessarily
any
greater
because
the
man
happens
to
be
in
prison.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
do
you
mean,
where
they
were
attempting
to
get
information
through
the
federal
agent?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances
relating
to
the
particular
interrogation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
isn't
so
much
that
he
is
in
for
one
crime
and
i
talked
to
him
about
another,
it
depends
on
what
they
are
asking
him
about,
i
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
criminal
investigations
and
if
there
was
prolonged
questioning
of
this
man,
if
they
were
badgering,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase,
then
i
think
very
clearly
the
miranda
--
the
warning
would
have
to
be
given.
it
would
not
be
--
there
would
be
enough
doubt
to
a
question
whether
the
admission
was
voluntary.
but
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
just
the
--
the
very
fact
that
the
way
this
man
came
in,
that
he
just
asked
him
these
questions.
he
didn't
probe
all
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
only
mutt
here,
there
was
no
jeff.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
here
to
show
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
this
kind
of
thing.
this
agent
was
not
attempting
to
try
to
develop
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
sense,
that
it
was
just
an
investigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
with
the
assumption,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
no
more
was
done,
that
no
more
was
done,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
just
pushing
the
position
but
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
this
case,
we
think
clearly,
was
not
a
criminal
investigation.
it
was
a
civil
investigation
and
everything
in
this
record
shows
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
this
morning
in
the
brief
remaining
time
to
discuss
two
other
aspects
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
question
whether
the
use
by
the
government
of
the
forms
extending
the
time
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
use
by
the
government
of
those
forms
as
handwriting
exemplars
violated
any
of
the
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights.
i
want
to
stress
at
the
outset
that
these
forms
were
not
used
to
prove
anything
that
was
stated
on
the
form.
it
was
just
used
by
the
handwriting
expert
to
compare
the
signature
on
the
form
where
the
signature
on
the
false
tax
returns
upon
which
the
conviction
of
filing
a
false
claim
was
based.
now
last
year,
this
court
in
gilbert
against
california
held
that
the
giving
of
a
handwriting
exemplar
did
not
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
pointed
out
that
the
handwriting
exemplar
as
such
is
not
a
testimonial
act.
it’s
not
--
does
not
involve
any
communicative
thing.
it
is
just
an
objective
fact.
the
same
as
the
sample
of
the
blood
that
had
been
taken
from
someone
and
i
stress
again
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
use
made
of
the
signatures
other
than
as
compared
for
purposes
of
comparison
between
what
was
shown
on
the
tax
return
and
what
was
shown
on
this
piece
of
paper.
so
that
under
the
ruling
in
gilbert,
there
was
no
need
for
the
agent
to
give
any
warning
with
respect
to
signing
these
documents.
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
tell
them
that
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
sign
that
is
that
they
give
the
consent.
so
we
think
whatever
may
be
the
conclusion
with
regard
to
the
admissions
that
he
made
to
the
agent,
certainly
this
does
not
carryover
or
tainted
in
anyway
the
government’s
use
of
the
handwriting
exemplars.
now
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
response
to
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
failure
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
the
motion
to
suppress
itself
denied
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights.
the
--
i’d
like
to
just
refer
briefly
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
yesterday
to
my
adversary
with
respect
to
whether
the
instructions
would
be
forced.
the
instructions
are
set
forth
in
the
record,
the
court’s
instructions
to
the
jury
and
the
court’s
instructions
did
not
leave
any
questions
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
voluntary
or
involuntary
about
that.
the
judge
ruled
on
that
and
while
the
judge
did
not
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
this
issue,
all
the
evidence
came
in,
and
motions
were
made
to
strike
the
testimony
of
the
revenue
agent
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
conversations
and
also
to
strike
the
testimony
of
the
handwriting
expert
who
testified
that
the
handwriting
on
the
returns
was
the
same
as
the
handwriting
on
these
three
consent
forms
and
also
on
the
check
for
the
refund
which
had
been
given
to
mr.
mathis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
to
qualify,
not
always
gives
a
miranda
warning,
always
gives
a
warning,
and
the
type
of
warning
he
gives
there
is
on
the
circumstances.
he
gives
the
full
miranda
warning
if
he
takes
the
man
into
the
custody.
he
gives
a
somewhat
lesser
warning
if
he
is
merely
questioning
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
lawless.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
have
to
be
the
former,
mr.
justice.
he
could
not
make
a
recommendation
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
merely
referred
the
case
to
the
special
intelligent
division
for
investigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
when
he
referred
it
over,
he
presumably
concluded
there
was
enough
here
to
call
for
some
criminal
investigation.
and,
of
course,
in
many
instances,
we
have
some
statistics
we
have
developed
showing
that
only
a
small
number
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
referred
by
revenue
agents
to
the
intelligence
division
eventuate
in
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
custody
of
course
in
the
sense
that
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
refers
to
one
other
phase
of
the
case
which
i’d
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to.
after
the
revenue
agent
had
seen
this
petitioner
in
the
jail
the
second
time
and
made
the
reference
to
the
intelligence
division
about
three
months
later,
this
agent,
this
man
together
with
a
so-called
special
agent
from
the
intelligence
division
again
visited
the
petitioner
to
the
penitentiary.
at
that
point,
they
did
give
them
the
warning
and
the
petitioner
replied
he
preferred
not
to
talk
about
the
matter
and
i
think
this
statement
to
which
you’ve
referred
at
page
97
was
just
in
reference
to
that,
that
the
jury
was
not
to
draw
any
inference
from
the
fact
that
when
the
intelligence
man
came
to
him
and
asked
him
some
question,
he
said
he
preferred
not
to
talk.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
was
no
refusal,
mr.
justice.
there
was
no
refusal
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
so.
i
think
all
of
the
suggestions
is
another
way
of
saying
since
he
was
not
required
to
is
a
voluntary
statement
that
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice
and
the
court
earlier
had
stated
when
he
was
at
page
92,
the
court
said,
“i
will
give
the
ordinary
run
of
mill
instructions”.
when
he
asked
whether
there
are
any
instructions
and
petitioner’s
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
but
apparently
–
no,
this
is
not
a
requested
instruction
because
there
were
no
requests.
there
was
one
instruction
that
the
united
states
attorney
requested
and
that
was
an
instruction
that
under
this
particular
offense,
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
anything.
the
offense
is
complete
when
a
false
claim
was
filed
but
he
said,
the
judge
indicated
he
was
just
giving
what
he
considered
the
routine
run
of
the
mill
instructions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i
got
exactly
what
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
first
two
interviews.
so
there
were
three
interviews.
there
were
two
interviews
on
the
30th
of
october
and
on
the
2nd
of
march
with
just
internal
revenue
agent
laws
and
that
was
the
third
interview
sometime
in
june
where
the
intelligence
officer
came
in
and
that
was
the
one
of
which
the
petitioner
declined
to
speak.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
course
prohibits
only
involuntary
incriminating
statements.
it
speaks
of,
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
give
testimony.”
voluntary
admissions,
even
if
made
to
a
government
investigating
agent,
even
if
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation,
which
is
i'll
come
to
briefly
this
was
not,
are
not
inadmissible
as
obtained
under
the
fifth
amendment,
if
an
admission
is
made
voluntarily.
now,
this
court
in
its
miranda
decision
concluded
that
because
of
the
experience
in
this
country
with
police
interrogation,
the
circumstances
under
which
experience
have
shown
the
police
interrogate
prisoners
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
special
protections
to
insure
that
in
the
case
of
interrogation
by
the
police
in
the
stationhouse,
that
would
appear
to
be
a
voluntary
admission
was
in
fact
voluntary.
that
is
additional
protections
were
made
necessary
because
of
the
experience
showing
that
has
conducted
in
this
country.
interrogation
of
a
man
who
had
been
taken
into
the
police
station
in
an
inherently
compelling
effect
of
itself,
that
is
the
mere
circumstances
as
shown
in
the
police
manuals,
the
psychological
pressures,
the
tricks,
the
situations
that
were
arranged
by
the
police
in
questioning
a
man.
this
itself
raised
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
when
a
man
did
speak
to
the
police
when
he
did
make
incriminating
admissions,
whether
this
really
was
the
result
of
free
choice
on
his
part.
and
therefore,
this
court
said
that
because
of
these
situations,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
privilege,
in
order
to
be
sure
that
when
a
man
speaks
after
he
had
been
interrogated
at
the
police
station,
after
he
had
been
taken
away
from
his
home,
certain
additional
protections
were
necessary.
how
to
be
specifically
won,
precisely
what
his
constitutional
rights
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
a
rather
broad
language
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
considerations
that
led
this
court
to
reach
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
interrogation
by
the
custodians.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
interrogators,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
i
said,
“or
any
other
place
where”
--
i
would
--
let
me
say,
mr.
justice,
what
you
have
in
a
case
is
that
a
man
is
in
prison
and
the
warden
calls
the
man
and
they
start
interrogating,
i
think
would
be
a
very
different
kind
of
situation.
but
that
it
seems
to
us
is
not
this
situation
and
our
point
is
that
there's
no
comparable
experience
to
show
that
the
mere
fact
questions
put
to
a
man
while
he
is
in
jail
by
someone
else
that
that
fact
is
sufficient
to
require
these
protections
in
every
case.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
ordinarily
not,
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
should
not
be.
i
would
not
think
so.
it
may
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
to
may
knowledge.
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
i
can
answer,
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
obviously
speak
and
say
that
there
may
not
be
a
case
when
a
particular
revenue
agent,
as
a
result
of
something
that
happens
in
his
interview
with
the
taxpayer
recommends
a
jeopardy
and
i
can
say
that
the
general
practice
is
that
the
refusal
of
a
taxpayer
to
talk
to
an
agent
does
not
affect
the
penalties
of
jeopardy
assessment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
check
--
mr.
justice,
when
i
get
back,
i
would
check
it
with
the
service
and
if
anything
i've
said
is
inaccurate,
we
will
of
course
correct
it
in
a
letter
to
the
clerk.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but,
i
want
to
mention
of
course
that
if
a
man
refuses
to
talk
to
a
revenue
agent
then
there
are
procedures.
they
can
serve
a
summons
upon
him
and
call
him
to
testify.
now,
we
think
that
in
situation
where
interrogation
takes
place,
when
someone
is
in
the
penitentiary
that
this
court
should
not
extend
the
miranda
principle
to
say
that
in
every
such
instance,
automatically,
the
warning
should
be
given
because
we
don't
think
there's
any
basis
in
our
experience
to
conclude
that
the
same
evils
that
were
present
in
the
police
station
interrogation
or
the
custodial
interrogation
of
the
type
involved
in
miranda
exists
here.
and
we
therefore
suggest
that
the
appropriate
standard
in
dealing
with
this
type
of
interrogation
is
the
same
standard
this
court
has
traditionally
applied
in
considering
the
voluntariness
of
confessions.
that
is
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstance.
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
we
attempt
to
decide
whether
in
fact
there
is
anything
here
to
suggest
that
the
admissions
made
by
the
particular
individual
does
not
represents
a
free
and
voluntary
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn't
think
that
in
terms
of
my
argument
would
make
any
difference
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
not
make
any
difference
but
i
don't
have
to
take
that
argument
on.
i
don't
think
because
we
say
that
this
record
does
not
indicate
this
was
a
criminal
investigation
at
all.
we
think
that
this
was
clearly
a
civil
investigation.
i'd
like
to
give
a
little
more
now
on
the
way
of
background
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
our
argument,
that's
right.
because
if
i
may
explain,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
the
service,
the
organization
of
the
service
how
the
service
conducts
these
investigations.
ordinarily,
an
investigation
such
as
was
made
by
internal
revenue
agent
lawless
is
considered
to
call
an
audit
and
the
only
function
of
a
man
making
an
audit
is
to
determine
whether
the
tax
return
accurately
reflects
the
tax
reported.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
another
branch
known
as
the
intelligence
division.
and
it's
the
intelligence
division
has
charge
of
investigating
possibilities
of
criminal
tax
fraud.
mr.
lawless
testified
that
his
sole
job
in
this
case
was
to
investigate
the
civil
tax
returns.
he
explained.
he
said,
all
he
was
attempting
to
do
is
to
determine
the
correct
tax
on
these
returns.
he
himself
unequivocally
testified
that
he
was
not
making
any
criminal
investigations.
he
also
testified
that
--
at
page
37
of
the
record
--
that
if
he
discovered
that
there
were
definite
indications
of
fraud,
his
duty
was
to
turn
the
matter
over
to
the
intelligence
division.
now,
mr.
lawless
made
two
visits
to
the
petitioner
in
the
florida
penitentiary.
his
first
visit
was
made
at
the
end
of
october
1964.
prior
to
that
time,
and
the
record
does
not
show
the
circumstances
under
which
it
taken
place,
the
petitioner
had
already
granted
one
extension
of
time
for
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
assessment
of
any
additional
tax
against
him
or
corresponding
we
would
also
extend
his
time
for
refund.
that
extension
was
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
december
and
agent
lawless
testified
that
when
he
went
to
the
penitentiary,
to
see
the
petitioner
at
the
end
of
october,
he
said
his
visit
had
two
purposes.
he
said,
first
of
all,
he
wanted
to
determine
whether
the
returns
that
were
assigned
to
him
for
audit
were
the
returns
of
the
petitioner
and
secondly,
to
get
an
extension
of
time
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
what
agent
lawless
did,
he
came
in
and
said
to
the
man
he
held
up
his
return
which
he
had
for
1960
and
said,
“is
ths
your
return?”
the
man
said,
“yes”
and
he
said,
“is
this
your
signature?”
and
he
said
“yes”.
this
seems
to
us
a
normal
question
to
be
asked
when
an
agent
is
investigating
someone's
civil
tax
return.
the
first
thing
he
wants
to
know
if
he's
sure
he's
got
the
right
man.
then
the
second
thing
he
did
was
in
effect
ask
him,
we
asked
him,
again
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitation,
something
that
petitioner
had
done
previously.
he
testified
that
he
explained
to
the
petitioner
that
he
had
no
obligation
to
sign
this,
that
was
up
him
to
explain
the
consequences
of
it
and
the
petitioner
signed
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
consequence
of
signing
a
return
would
be,
on
the
one
hand
the
government's
time
for
assessing
an
additional
tax,
statute
of
limitation
would
be
extended
and
at
the
same
time,
it
would
extend
the
taxpayer's
time
within
which
he
could
make
a
claim
for
refund.
so
that's
in
effect
a
mutual
arrangement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
gave
him
no
warning
in
the
constitutional
sense
because,
mr.
justice,
he
was
not
at
that
time
making
a
criminal
tax
investigation.
he
was
just
seeking
an
extension
for
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
you
said
he
hadn't
arrived
at
the
criminal
stage
it
was
far
from
the
criminal
stage.
this
witness
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
criminal
stage
came
on
about
seven
or
eight
months.
well,
seven
or
at
six
or
seven
or
five
months
later,
the
matter
was
assigned
to
--
was
transferred
by
agent
lawless
to
the
intelligence
division.
it
was
some
three
or
four
months
after
that
the
indictment
was
actually
returned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
result,
mr.
justice
of
an
investigation
by
the
intelligence
division.
i
think
it's
significant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
not,
mr.
justice,
but
at
that
point,
lawless
testified
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
criminal
investigation.
the
judge
at
one
point
said
then
well
that
possibility
exists
whenever
you
have
an
income
tax
investigation,
whenever
anyone's
return
is
ordered,
one
never
knows
what
may
turn
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
that
would
not
be
enough,
mr.
justice
because
i
think
that
is
just
--
at
that
point
there
is
no
overreaching
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
at
that
early
stage
of
the
proceeding,
the
thing
hadn't
really
gotten
close
enough
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
internal
revenue
agents
look
at
a
case,
think
there
may
be
something
suggesting
fraud
and
end
up
not
making
a
reference.
there
are
many
more
instances
where
a
case
is
referred
to
the
intelligence
division
and
yet
nothing
eventuates
from
it.
we
have
some
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
in
that
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
looking
to
see
what
the
facts
are
and
if
anything
develops
which
may
lead
to
an
indication
of
fraud,
it's
their
duty
to
turn
it
over
to
the
intelligence
division.
but
they
are
not
looking
for
fraud
in
the
same
sense
for
example
that
a
detective
who
was
going
out
seeking
to
solve
a
crime.
they
are
not
attempting
--
the
whole
purpose
of
a
civil
tax
investigation
is
not
to
gather
evidence,
not
to
discover
fraud
or
crime.
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
ascertain
whether
the
return
is
correct
or
whether
there
is
additional
tax
own.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
this
is
not
part
of
the
plot
or
the
scheme
by
the
government
to
use
a
civil
tax
investigated
to
try
to
get
evidence
of
fraud.
now,
the
nature
of
our
tax
laws
as
such
that
there
are
situations
where
in
the
course
of
a
civil
tax
investigation
evidences
developed
which
ultimately
leads
to
a
criminal
prosecution
but
it
seems
to
us
the
mere
fact
that
that
evidence
begins
to
be
developed
at
a
point
when
the
civil
investigation
is
underway,
that's
not
enough
to
turn
it
into
a
criminal
type
of
proceeding
to
which
the
constitutional
protections
must
be
made
put
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
solely
a
civil
--
no,
i
understand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
understand
they
do
not,
mr.
justice.
the
practice
of
the
service
is,
the
warnings
are
given
only
when
a
special
agent
is
called
into
the
case.
that
is
when
the
matter
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
criminal
stage
and
then
they
do
give
them
a
warning
but
as
long
as
it
take
civil
investigation,
they
do
not
give
him
warning.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
make
it
--
under
two
elements
of
this
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
one
is
the
fact
that
at
this
stage
has
not
yet
reached
yet
the
criminal
stage.
it
was
a
possibility
only
in
the
sense
that
a
criminal
prosecution
is
possible
in
any
such
investigation.
the
other
thing
of
course,
it
seems
to
me,
which
i
think
it's
equally
significant,
is
that
in
this
case
there
were
present
--
none
of
the
overreaching,
none
of
the
kind
of
pressures
that
are
characteristically
associated
with
coercive
interrogation,
it
was
only
one
man.
they
didn't
have
a
team
come
in.
they
didn't
play
the
“mutt
and
jeff”
team,
there's
one
man.
but
there's
no
lengthy
questioning.
there
are
two
questions
that
were
asked.
there
was
no
trickery.
there
was
no
psychological
pressure.
there
was
no
setting
up
a
situation
under
which
the
man
would
be
feeling
impelled
to
talk.
this
man,
unlike
the
people
in
miranda
hadn't
been
dragged
or
swept
from
familiar
surroundings
in
the
police
custody.
by
the
time
he
was
interviewed
in
this
jail,
he'd
been
there
for
more
than
18
months.
there's
no
reason
for
this
man
to
think
that
because
he
cooperated
with
the
federal
officers
that
this
in
any
way
would
affect
him
in
his
state
situation,
either
he
would
get
him
out
of
the
state
jail,
that
it
would
make
shorten
his
sentence
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
plus
the
fact
that
in
miranda,
they
were
interviewing
the
man
in
an
attempt
to
get
him
to
make
admissions
about
a
crime
that
was
being
asked
to
examine
whereas
in
this
case,
the
man
was
not
being
interviewed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
which
he
had
been
arrested,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
two
aspects.
two
aspects
--
the
false
claim
for
a
refund,
turned
of
course
on
whether
he
should
turn
on
–
well
there
are
two
possibilities.
one,
the
question
whether
he
had
overstated
his
tax,
the
amount
of
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
mr.
justice,
if
he
had
correctly
reported
his
income
and
if
in
fact
the
six
or
seven
dependents
that
he
listed
on
each
of
these
returns,
i
pointed
out
that
each
of
these
years,
he
listed
six
or
seven
or
eight
dependents
and
with
one
exception,
they
all
had
different
names.
if
he
had
actually
received
this
money
and
if
these
dependents
were
fictitious,
then
of
course
there
was
an
additional
tax
owing.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
just
would
had
been
--
the
tax
may
have
been
more
than
what
was
reported
in
one
instance.
in
one
instance
in
fact,
which
is
government's
exhibit
2-a
shown
at
106
of
the
record,
his
own
calculations
were
in
error
and
the
record
shows
that
when
someone
look
at
this
in
the
internal
revenue
service,
they
crossed
off
the
amount
he
had
shown
as
the
tax
to
have
$931.00
recalculated
on
the
basis
of
what
he
showed
his
income
and
the
number
of
exemptions
and
concluded
that
instead
of
being
entitled
to
a
$900.00
refund,
he
had
another
$142.00
of
tax.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
on
my
remaining
time
to
the
contention
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
this
case
in
failing
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
what
i
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
we
don't
have
any
similar
experience
in
connection
with
questioning
people
who
are
in
the
jail
where
they're
held,
as
in
this
case,
by
another
authority
to
suggest
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
insist
on
a
rule
that
whenever
there
is
such
questioning,
whenever
a
man
is
questioned
and
he
is
in
jail,
that
automatically
the
warnings
need
be
given.
i
suggest
it
should
depend
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
may
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
any
empirical
basis
for
concluding
that
when
someone
comes
from
the
outside
to
ask
a
prisoner
two
questions
that
the
mere
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
two
questions,
two
questions.
but
this
is
not
a
case
of
prolonged
interrogation.
if
this
was
a
case
of
real
custodian
interrogation
of
overreaching,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
rule
should
be
any
different.
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
case
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
a
voluntary
admission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
explain
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
man
was
not
in
the
federal
prison.
this
man
is
in
the
state
prison.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
man
is
in
a
state
prison
serving
a
state
sentence
for
an
unrelated
offense
to
the
federal
offense.
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
pressures,
the
pressures
upon
this
man
to
speak
to
the
agent,
to
the
federal
agent
who
comes
in
to
talk
to
him,
i
suggest
the
pressures
are
not
necessarily
any
greater
because
the
man
happens
to
be
in
prison.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
do
you
mean,
where
they
were
attempting
to
get
information
through
the
federal
agent?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances
relating
to
the
particular
interrogation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
isn't
so
much
that
he
is
in
for
one
crime
and
i
talked
to
him
about
another,
it
depends
on
what
they
are
asking
him
about,
i
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
criminal
investigations
and
if
there
was
prolonged
questioning
of
this
man,
if
they
were
badgering,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase,
then
i
think
very
clearly
the
miranda
--
the
warning
would
have
to
be
given.
it
would
not
be
--
there
would
be
enough
doubt
to
a
question
whether
the
admission
was
voluntary.
but
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
just
the
--
the
very
fact
that
the
way
this
man
came
in,
that
he
just
asked
him
these
questions.
he
didn't
probe
all
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
only
mutt
here,
there
was
no
jeff.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
here
to
show
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
this
kind
of
thing.
this
agent
was
not
attempting
to
try
to
develop
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
sense,
that
it
was
just
an
investigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
with
the
assumption,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
no
more
was
done,
that
no
more
was
done,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
just
pushing
the
position
but
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
this
case,
we
think
clearly,
was
not
a
criminal
investigation.
it
was
a
civil
investigation
and
everything
in
this
record
shows
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
this
morning
in
the
brief
remaining
time
to
discuss
two
other
aspects
of
the
case.
the
first
is
the
question
whether
the
use
by
the
government
of
the
forms
extending
the
time
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
use
by
the
government
of
those
forms
as
handwriting
exemplars
violated
any
of
the
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights.
i
want
to
stress
at
the
outset
that
these
forms
were
not
used
to
prove
anything
that
was
stated
on
the
form.
it
was
just
used
by
the
handwriting
expert
to
compare
the
signature
on
the
form
where
the
signature
on
the
false
tax
returns
upon
which
the
conviction
of
filing
a
false
claim
was
based.
now
last
year,
this
court
in
gilbert
against
california
held
that
the
giving
of
a
handwriting
exemplar
did
not
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
pointed
out
that
the
handwriting
exemplar
as
such
is
not
a
testimonial
act.
it’s
not
--
does
not
involve
any
communicative
thing.
it
is
just
an
objective
fact.
the
same
as
the
sample
of
the
blood
that
had
been
taken
from
someone
and
i
stress
again
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
use
made
of
the
signatures
other
than
as
compared
for
purposes
of
comparison
between
what
was
shown
on
the
tax
return
and
what
was
shown
on
this
piece
of
paper.
so
that
under
the
ruling
in
gilbert,
there
was
no
need
for
the
agent
to
give
any
warning
with
respect
to
signing
these
documents.
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
tell
them
that
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
sign
that
is
that
they
give
the
consent.
so
we
think
whatever
may
be
the
conclusion
with
regard
to
the
admissions
that
he
made
to
the
agent,
certainly
this
does
not
carryover
or
tainted
in
anyway
the
government’s
use
of
the
handwriting
exemplars.
now
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
response
to
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
failure
to
hold
a
separate
hearing
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
the
motion
to
suppress
itself
denied
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights.
the
--
i’d
like
to
just
refer
briefly
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
yesterday
to
my
adversary
with
respect
to
whether
the
instructions
would
be
forced.
the
instructions
are
set
forth
in
the
record,
the
court’s
instructions
to
the
jury
and
the
court’s
instructions
did
not
leave
any
questions
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
voluntary
or
involuntary
about
that.
the
judge
ruled
on
that
and
while
the
judge
did
not
hold
a
separate
hearing
on
this
issue,
all
the
evidence
came
in,
and
motions
were
made
to
strike
the
testimony
of
the
revenue
agent
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
conversations
and
also
to
strike
the
testimony
of
the
handwriting
expert
who
testified
that
the
handwriting
on
the
returns
was
the
same
as
the
handwriting
on
these
three
consent
forms
and
also
on
the
check
for
the
refund
which
had
been
given
to
mr.
mathis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
to
qualify,
not
always
gives
a
miranda
warning,
always
gives
a
warning,
and
the
type
of
warning
he
gives
there
is
on
the
circumstances.
he
gives
the
full
miranda
warning
if
he
takes
the
man
into
the
custody.
he
gives
a
somewhat
lesser
warning
if
he
is
merely
questioning
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
lawless.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
have
to
be
the
former,
mr.
justice.
he
could
not
make
a
recommendation
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
merely
referred
the
case
to
the
special
intelligent
division
for
investigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
when
he
referred
it
over,
he
presumably
concluded
there
was
enough
here
to
call
for
some
criminal
investigation.
and,
of
course,
in
many
instances,
we
have
some
statistics
we
have
developed
showing
that
only
a
small
number
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
referred
by
revenue
agents
to
the
intelligence
division
eventuate
in
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
custody
of
course
in
the
sense
that
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
refers
to
one
other
phase
of
the
case
which
i’d
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to.
after
the
revenue
agent
had
seen
this
petitioner
in
the
jail
the
second
time
and
made
the
reference
to
the
intelligence
division
about
three
months
later,
this
agent,
this
man
together
with
a
so-called
special
agent
from
the
intelligence
division
again
visited
the
petitioner
to
the
penitentiary.
at
that
point,
they
did
give
them
the
warning
and
the
petitioner
replied
he
preferred
not
to
talk
about
the
matter
and
i
think
this
statement
to
which
you’ve
referred
at
page
97
was
just
in
reference
to
that,
that
the
jury
was
not
to
draw
any
inference
from
the
fact
that
when
the
intelligence
man
came
to
him
and
asked
him
some
question,
he
said
he
preferred
not
to
talk.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
was
no
refusal,
mr.
justice.
there
was
no
refusal
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
so.
i
think
all
of
the
suggestions
is
another
way
of
saying
since
he
was
not
required
to
is
a
voluntary
statement
that
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice
and
the
court
earlier
had
stated
when
he
was
at
page
92,
the
court
said,
“i
will
give
the
ordinary
run
of
mill
instructions”.
when
he
asked
whether
there
are
any
instructions
and
petitioner’s
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
but
apparently
–
no,
this
is
not
a
requested
instruction
because
there
were
no
requests.
there
was
one
instruction
that
the
united
states
attorney
requested
and
that
was
an
instruction
that
under
this
particular
offense,
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
anything.
the
offense
is
complete
when
a
false
claim
was
filed
but
he
said,
the
judge
indicated
he
was
just
giving
what
he
considered
the
routine
run
of
the
mill
instructions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i
got
exactly
what
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
first
two
interviews.
so
there
were
three
interviews.
there
were
two
interviews
on
the
30th
of
october
and
on
the
2nd
of
march
with
just
internal
revenue
agent
laws
and
that
was
the
third
interview
sometime
in
june
where
the
intelligence
officer
came
in
and
that
was
the
one
of
which
the
petitioner
declined
to
speak.
