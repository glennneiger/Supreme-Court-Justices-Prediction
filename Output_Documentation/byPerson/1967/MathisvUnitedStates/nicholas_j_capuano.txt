mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
mathis
was
convicted
of
filing
false
income
tax
returns
for
1960
and
1961.
a
sentence
was
imposed
of
30
months
to
run
concurrently.
the
time
on
issue,
i
believe
to
be
resolved
here,
is
whether
the
constitutional
principles
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
miranda
versus
arizona
are
applicable
to
the
facts
in
the
mathis
case.
at
the
very
outset,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
petitioner's
assault
on
his
conviction
does
not
rise
or
fall
solely
on
the
applicability
of
miranda
but
also
on
the
applicability
of
constitutional
principles
involved
in
cases
of
this
nature.
in
united
states
versus
harrison,
265
federal
supplement
at
page
666,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
suppressed
certain
oral
statements
that
were
given
to
an
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
while
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
in
the
dannemora
state
prison.
now,
the
facts
in
the
harrison
case
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
facts
in
the
mathis
case.
in
april
of
1965,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
harrison.
in
that
one,
charged
the
defendant
with
understating
his
income
for
the
calendar
years
1958
and
1959.
in
march
of
1961,
while
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
at
dannemora,
he
was
interviewed
by
an
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
he
was
asked
and
he
answered
certain
questions
about
his
income,
his
assets
and
the
filing
of
his
returns.
he
was
not
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
prior
to
the
questioning.
district
judge
tyler
in
granting
the
motion
to
suppress
stated
although
perhaps
this
was
not
a
usual
and
typical
cause
to
arrest
situation,
the
interview
in
his
opinion
could
not
sensibly
be
viewed
as
anything
but
another
instance
of
custodial
interrogation,
as
no
warnings
were
given
by
the
agent
to
harrison,
no
evidence
obtained
from
the
questioning
could
be
used
against
him
citing
miranda
versus
arizona.
the
miranda
case
and
the
harrison
case
and
the
escobedo
case
illustrate
the
concern
of
the
court
regarding
interrogations
which
are
conducted
in
a
compelling
atmosphere
for
the
setting
in
which
they
take
place.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
constitutional
safeguards
should
be
abridged
to
accommodate
tax
investigators
whose
activities
often
conceal
transformation
of
a
civil
to
a
criminal
tax
investigation.
agent
lawless
of
the
lnternal
revenue
service
candidly
admitted
that
when
he
interviewed
mathis
at
raiford
state
prison
on
october
30th
of
1964
and
again
on
march
2nd
of
1965,
he
did
not
advised
mathis
of
his
constitutional
rights
prior
to
his
questions.
although
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
criminal
violation,
the
wording
in
escobedo
certainly
applies
to
the
mathis
case.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
well,
that
was
one
way
of
simply
dismissing
it
but
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
failed
to
consider
was
the
testimony
of
agent
derry
who
was
a
criminal
tax
investigator.
as
early
as
february
6th
of
1963,
they
became
suspicious
of
mathis.
at
that
time,
the
record
will
show
that
sheriff
buckles
of
osceola
county
telephoned
agent
derry
and
asked
him
to
come
to
kissimmee
where
he
turned
over
a
letter,
and
the
two
returns
for
one
year
which
should
have
made
that
veteran
investigator
very
suspicious
and
obviously
made
sheriff
buckle
suspicious,
but
agent
derry
explained
that
all
he
did
in
1963
was
put
these
two
returns
that
was
supposed
to
be
filed
for
the
same
year
together
with
this
letter
that
allegedly
was
written
by
mathis
to
his
wife.
he
put
him
in
his
personal
locked
file,
which
to
me
is
just
unbelievable.
a
veteran
investigator
who
knows
at
that
time
that
there's
something
wrong
just
puts
this
kind
of
information
in
a
personal
locked
file
and
forgets
them.
but
of
course,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
mention
that
and
they
labeled
it
as
a
routine
tax
investigation.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
the
jury
instructions?
i
do
not
believe
so
judge.
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
and
the
record
was
made
up.
my
function
of
course
was
to
file
the
necessary
briefs
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
jury
instructions
were
included
by
the
trial
attorney.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir,
absolutely
correct.
but,
to
go
on,
as
i
said,
the
wording
in
escobedo
certainly
would
apply
to
mathis
where
the
court
said
that
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
was
essential
to
advice
the
petitioner
of
his
right
in
a
delicate
situation.
and
this
was
the
stage
when
legal
aid
and
advice
were
most
critical
to
the
petitioner.
and
what
happened
at
the
interrogation
could
certainly
affect
the
whole
trial
since
rights
may
be
irretrievably
lost
if
not
then
and
there
asserted
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
mathis
case.
as
stated
in
miranda,
it
said,
“the
warning
is
needed
in
order
to
make
him
aware
not
only
of
the
privilege
but
also
of
the
consequences
of
foregoing
it.
moreover,
this
warning
may
serve
to
make
the
individual
more
acutely
aware
that
he
is
not
in
the
presence
of
persons
acting
solely
in
his
interest.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
he
is
in
the
presence
of
persons
acting
solely
against
his
interest.
yet,
eight
days
later
on
march
10
of
1965,
agent
lawless
referred
this
case
to
the
internal
revenue,
intelligence
division
as
involving
definite
indications
of
fraud.
now
i
believe
that
for
the
full
achievement
of
miranda
values,
a
person
needs
more
than
a
sympathetic
explanation
before
his
interrogation.
what
he
needs
most
is
a
sympathetic
advocate
during
that
interrogation.
no
one
will
deny
that
the
custody
which
mathis
was
being
held
in
raiford
state
prison
was
a
type
during
which
unwitnessed
or
coercive
methods
could
have
been
used
and
i
do
not
mean
to
infer
by
any
means
that
they
were
used.
but
no
one
can
also
deny
that
mathis
was
completely
under
the
control
and
domination
of
his
jailers.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
absolutely
correct.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
as
a
practical
matter,
judge,
let
us
assume
that
mathis
said,
“i
wanted
a
lawyer”.
there
was
no
telephone
available
to
him.
there's
no
lawyers
in
raiford.
could
he
have
complained
to
anyone
that
he
was
denied
access
to
a
lawyer
or
denied
access
to
a
telephone?
this
is
not
the
situation
where
you
and
i
are
sitting
in
our
homes
or
in
our
place
of
business
and
an
agent
walks
in
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
no
except
that
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
he
was
incarcerated,
certainly
had
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
well,
i
wouldn't
dismiss
in
the
same
would
be
no
problem,
but
there
be
less
problems.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
don't
think
that
the
psychological
pressures
of
a
person
sitting
in
his
home
are
the
same
as
those
sitting
in
raiford
state
prison.
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
bennie
brooks
case
which
of
course
i
won't
go
into
but
you're
all
familiar
with.
the
government
contended
that
mathis
received
in
cash
the
refund
check
for
1960
and
filed
a
false
claim
for
1961
but
it's
interesting
to
note
only
the
1960
check
was
offered
in
evidence,
not
the
1961
check.
now,
the
government
in
their
reply
brief
simply
stated
that
the
reason
that
the
1961
check
was
not
offered
in
evidence
at
that
time
was
because
no
check
was
issued,
the
return
indicating
a
balance
due.
walter
herron,
the
special
assistant
treasurer
of
the
united
states
whom
the
government
brought
down
from
washington,
testified
that
two
government
checks
were
issued
and
that
two
were
cashed.
to
me,
it's
quite
obvious
why
the
1961
refund
check
was
not
offered
in
evidence.
the
names
may
have
been
similar
but
i'm
of
the
opinion
that
the
signatures
were
not.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
real
purpose
of
lawless'
visit
to
raiford
was
not
to
obtain
the
consent
as
he
testified
to
extend
the
statute
limitation
but
merely
to
obtain
a
sample
of
the
defendant's
handwriting
under
the
guise
of
a
civil
routine
tax
investigation,
when
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
material
was
being
used
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
evidence
of
criminal
wrongdoing
that
to
me
poses
an
issue
which
strikes
at
the
very
core
of
constitutional
immunity.
of
course,
the
recurring
argument
made
on
that
type
of
case
is
that
society's
need
for
interrogation
outweighed
the
privilege.
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
the
taxpayer's
own
records
and
statement
represent
the
easiest
shortcut
to
a
criminal
investigation.
now,
this
court
in
gilbert
versus
california
ruled
that
handwriting
samples
not
to
be
evidence
of
testimonial
or
communicative
in
nature,
included
within
the
fifth
amendment
although
mr.
chief
justice
warren
dissented,
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
fortas.
now,
mathis
may
have
had
a
different
aspect,
had
lawless
merely
obtained
mathis'
signature,
but
agent
lawless
went
beyond
that.
what
he
did
was
he
showed
mathis
a
return
and
said,
“is
this
your
signature?”
and
mathis
answered
that
it
was
and
he
said,
“is
this
your
return?”
and
mathis
answered
that
it
was.
to
me
it
cannot
logically
be
argued
that
such
answers
to
such
questions
are
not
evidence
of
testimonial
or
of
a
communicative
nature
included
within
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now,
we're
getting
back
to
agent
derry.
as
early
as
february
6,
1963,
special
agent
derry
of
the
intelligence
division
received
certain
documents.
they
were
later
introduced
in
evidence
as
government's
exhibit
10.
what
these
documents
consisted
of
was
a
letter
which
was
allegedly
written
by
mathis
to
his
wife,
showing
that
he
intended
to
file
two
tax
refunds
for
one
year,
the
year
1962.
now,
this
fact
was
mentioned
by
the
government
in
their
statement,
their
opening
statement
to
the
jury.
the
government
was
permitted
to
use
that
information
against
mathis
to
show
knowledge
and
intent.
and
i
suggest
that
the
internal
revenue
service,
intelligence
division,
became
suspicious
of
mathis
in
february
of
1963,
some
20
or
21
months
before
agent
lawless
made
his
visit
to
raiford.
that
was
on
october
30th
of
1964.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
how
this
letter
was
obtained.
this
letter
was
intercepted
by
sheriff
buckles
of
osceola
county
and
i
assume
that
mathis
at
that
time
was
in
the
county
jail.
buckles
telephoned
agent
derry
and
at
buckles'
request,
agent
derry
made
a
trip
to
kissimmee
to
sheriff
buckles'
office.
the
letter
and
the
two
returns
were
given
to
agent
derry.
and
as
agent
derry
testified,
he
kept
two
returns,
the
two
returns
and
the
letter
in
his
locked
personal
file
until
june
4th
of
1965
when
he
turned
them
over
to
special
agent
shelley.
and
as
i
said
before,
it's
beyond
belief
that
a
trained
and
veteran
criminal
investigator
would
just
put
away
these
documents
and
simply
forget
them.
yet
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
they
found
definite
indications
of
fraud
on
march
10th
of
1965,
which
is
when
they
referred
the
case
to
the
intelligence
division.
now,
the
government
claims
that
agent
lawless
was
stationed
in
the
jacksonville
office
which
is
approximately
100
miles
north
of
orlando.
agent
derry
was
stationed
in
the
orlando
office.
but
i
drove
up
and
i
was
able
to
check
the
distance,
it
is
145
miles
from
orlando
to
jacksonville.
it
is
50
miles
from
jacksonville
to
raiford.
it
is
16
miles
from
orlando
to
kissimmee.
so
then
it
was
only
natural
that
agent
lawless
would
visit
mathis
at
raiford
since
jacksonville
is
much
closer
to
raiford
than
orlando.
now,
our
second
assignment
of
error
is
based
upon
the
court
depriving
the
petitioner
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution
in
refusing
throughout
the
trial
to
hear
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
as
provided
by
the
rule.
and
we
feel
that
this
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
by
judge
choate.
now,
in
challenging
the
legality
of
this
evidence
and
how
it
was
obtained,
trial
counsel
repeatedly
moved
to
suppress
it
and
the
trial
judge,
in
rejecting
that
offer
stated,
“it's
too
late
now.
i
will
hear
it
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
you
can
do
it
later
on
to
suppress
it.
the
evidence
will
probably
come
in.”
and
still
refusing
to
hear
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
trial
judge
further
stated,
“i
will
overrule
that.
you
don't
have
to
advice
everybody
of
his
rights
every
time
you
ask
him
questions.
i
think
we
are
coming
to
that
pretty
quickly
if
the
supreme
court
keeps
on.”
mr.
lorie,
the
trial
lawyer,
responded,
“we
have
come
to
that
in
the
case
of
miranda
versus
arizona,”
and
the
judge
replied,
“
oh
no!
miranda
says
if
you
arrest
a
man
you
have
a
collar
on
him.
you
can
ask
him
any
questions”.
that's
all
it
says.
now,
i
know
of
no
greater
or
stronger
collar
than
one
made
of
rock
and
steel
surrounded
by
armed
guards.
in
any
event,
i
take
the
position
that
had
the
judge
heard
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
that
his
ruling
would
have
been
the
same,
it
would
have
been
denied.
he
was
not
too
happy
with
the
miranda
decision
obviously.
now,
in
denying
the
petitioner
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
his
motion
to
suppress
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
was
highly
prejudicial.
the
jury
was
able
to
hear
throughout
the
testimony
of
certain
government
witnesses
that
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
in
the
florida
state
penitentiary
for
an
unrelated
offense
and
that
to
deny
him
a
motion
to
suppress
outside
their
presence
and
hearing,
certainly
denied
the
petitioner
a
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
now,
in
referring
to
the
incarceration
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
was
just
as
highly
prejudicial
as
informing
the
jury
of
the
defendant's
prior
convictions.
in
pinto
versus
pierce,
389
u.s.
at
page
31
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
this
was
an
application
by
a
state
prisoner
for
habeas
corpus.
the
facts
are
of
their
brief.
pierce
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
a
new
jersey
court.
he
applied
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey.
the
united
states
district
court
granted
the
writ
and
allowed
the
petitioner
a
new
trial
on
the
merits.
what
pierce
was
seeking
was
a
new
trial
because
the
testimony
in
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
incriminating
statement
was
heard
and
determined
by
the
judge
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
third
circuit
affirmed,
saying
that
the
united
states
district
judge
was
plainly
right.
i
asked
this
court
to
wield
and
broaden
miranda
brush
to
effect
the
cure
concerning
the
constitutional
principles
which
are
or
certainly
should
be
applied
to
tax
cases
and
to
the
case
at
bar.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
that
the
conviction
of
mathis
should
be
reversed.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
if
the
court
please,
under
these
circumstances,
i
believe
that
after
careful
consideration,
i’ll
waive
any
rebuttal
that
i
may
have
had
and
i’ll
try
to
put
them
on
the
head.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
mathis
was
convicted
of
filing
false
income
tax
returns
for
1960
and
1961.
a
sentence
was
imposed
of
30
months
to
run
concurrently.
the
time
on
issue,
i
believe
to
be
resolved
here,
is
whether
the
constitutional
principles
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
miranda
versus
arizona
are
applicable
to
the
facts
in
the
mathis
case.
at
the
very
outset,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
petitioner's
assault
on
his
conviction
does
not
rise
or
fall
solely
on
the
applicability
of
miranda
but
also
on
the
applicability
of
constitutional
principles
involved
in
cases
of
this
nature.
in
united
states
versus
harrison,
265
federal
supplement
at
page
666,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
suppressed
certain
oral
statements
that
were
given
to
an
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
while
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
in
the
dannemora
state
prison.
now,
the
facts
in
the
harrison
case
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
facts
in
the
mathis
case.
in
april
of
1965,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
harrison.
in
that
one,
charged
the
defendant
with
understating
his
income
for
the
calendar
years
1958
and
1959.
in
march
of
1961,
while
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
at
dannemora,
he
was
interviewed
by
an
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
he
was
asked
and
he
answered
certain
questions
about
his
income,
his
assets
and
the
filing
of
his
returns.
he
was
not
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
prior
to
the
questioning.
district
judge
tyler
in
granting
the
motion
to
suppress
stated
although
perhaps
this
was
not
a
usual
and
typical
cause
to
arrest
situation,
the
interview
in
his
opinion
could
not
sensibly
be
viewed
as
anything
but
another
instance
of
custodial
interrogation,
as
no
warnings
were
given
by
the
agent
to
harrison,
no
evidence
obtained
from
the
questioning
could
be
used
against
him
citing
miranda
versus
arizona.
the
miranda
case
and
the
harrison
case
and
the
escobedo
case
illustrate
the
concern
of
the
court
regarding
interrogations
which
are
conducted
in
a
compelling
atmosphere
for
the
setting
in
which
they
take
place.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
constitutional
safeguards
should
be
abridged
to
accommodate
tax
investigators
whose
activities
often
conceal
transformation
of
a
civil
to
a
criminal
tax
investigation.
agent
lawless
of
the
lnternal
revenue
service
candidly
admitted
that
when
he
interviewed
mathis
at
raiford
state
prison
on
october
30th
of
1964
and
again
on
march
2nd
of
1965,
he
did
not
advised
mathis
of
his
constitutional
rights
prior
to
his
questions.
although
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
criminal
violation,
the
wording
in
escobedo
certainly
applies
to
the
mathis
case.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
well,
that
was
one
way
of
simply
dismissing
it
but
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
failed
to
consider
was
the
testimony
of
agent
derry
who
was
a
criminal
tax
investigator.
as
early
as
february
6th
of
1963,
they
became
suspicious
of
mathis.
at
that
time,
the
record
will
show
that
sheriff
buckles
of
osceola
county
telephoned
agent
derry
and
asked
him
to
come
to
kissimmee
where
he
turned
over
a
letter,
and
the
two
returns
for
one
year
which
should
have
made
that
veteran
investigator
very
suspicious
and
obviously
made
sheriff
buckle
suspicious,
but
agent
derry
explained
that
all
he
did
in
1963
was
put
these
two
returns
that
was
supposed
to
be
filed
for
the
same
year
together
with
this
letter
that
allegedly
was
written
by
mathis
to
his
wife.
he
put
him
in
his
personal
locked
file,
which
to
me
is
just
unbelievable.
a
veteran
investigator
who
knows
at
that
time
that
there's
something
wrong
just
puts
this
kind
of
information
in
a
personal
locked
file
and
forgets
them.
but
of
course,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
mention
that
and
they
labeled
it
as
a
routine
tax
investigation.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
the
jury
instructions?
i
do
not
believe
so
judge.
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
and
the
record
was
made
up.
my
function
of
course
was
to
file
the
necessary
briefs
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
jury
instructions
were
included
by
the
trial
attorney.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir,
absolutely
correct.
but,
to
go
on,
as
i
said,
the
wording
in
escobedo
certainly
would
apply
to
mathis
where
the
court
said
that
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
was
essential
to
advice
the
petitioner
of
his
right
in
a
delicate
situation.
and
this
was
the
stage
when
legal
aid
and
advice
were
most
critical
to
the
petitioner.
and
what
happened
at
the
interrogation
could
certainly
affect
the
whole
trial
since
rights
may
be
irretrievably
lost
if
not
then
and
there
asserted
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
mathis
case.
as
stated
in
miranda,
it
said,
“the
warning
is
needed
in
order
to
make
him
aware
not
only
of
the
privilege
but
also
of
the
consequences
of
foregoing
it.
moreover,
this
warning
may
serve
to
make
the
individual
more
acutely
aware
that
he
is
not
in
the
presence
of
persons
acting
solely
in
his
interest.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
he
is
in
the
presence
of
persons
acting
solely
against
his
interest.
yet,
eight
days
later
on
march
10
of
1965,
agent
lawless
referred
this
case
to
the
internal
revenue,
intelligence
division
as
involving
definite
indications
of
fraud.
now
i
believe
that
for
the
full
achievement
of
miranda
values,
a
person
needs
more
than
a
sympathetic
explanation
before
his
interrogation.
what
he
needs
most
is
a
sympathetic
advocate
during
that
interrogation.
no
one
will
deny
that
the
custody
which
mathis
was
being
held
in
raiford
state
prison
was
a
type
during
which
unwitnessed
or
coercive
methods
could
have
been
used
and
i
do
not
mean
to
infer
by
any
means
that
they
were
used.
but
no
one
can
also
deny
that
mathis
was
completely
under
the
control
and
domination
of
his
jailers.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
absolutely
correct.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
yes,
sir.
as
a
practical
matter,
judge,
let
us
assume
that
mathis
said,
“i
wanted
a
lawyer”.
there
was
no
telephone
available
to
him.
there's
no
lawyers
in
raiford.
could
he
have
complained
to
anyone
that
he
was
denied
access
to
a
lawyer
or
denied
access
to
a
telephone?
this
is
not
the
situation
where
you
and
i
are
sitting
in
our
homes
or
in
our
place
of
business
and
an
agent
walks
in
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
no
except
that
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
he
was
incarcerated,
certainly
had
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
well,
i
wouldn't
dismiss
in
the
same
would
be
no
problem,
but
there
be
less
problems.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
don't
think
that
the
psychological
pressures
of
a
person
sitting
in
his
home
are
the
same
as
those
sitting
in
raiford
state
prison.
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
bennie
brooks
case
which
of
course
i
won't
go
into
but
you're
all
familiar
with.
the
government
contended
that
mathis
received
in
cash
the
refund
check
for
1960
and
filed
a
false
claim
for
1961
but
it's
interesting
to
note
only
the
1960
check
was
offered
in
evidence,
not
the
1961
check.
now,
the
government
in
their
reply
brief
simply
stated
that
the
reason
that
the
1961
check
was
not
offered
in
evidence
at
that
time
was
because
no
check
was
issued,
the
return
indicating
a
balance
due.
walter
herron,
the
special
assistant
treasurer
of
the
united
states
whom
the
government
brought
down
from
washington,
testified
that
two
government
checks
were
issued
and
that
two
were
cashed.
to
me,
it's
quite
obvious
why
the
1961
refund
check
was
not
offered
in
evidence.
the
names
may
have
been
similar
but
i'm
of
the
opinion
that
the
signatures
were
not.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
real
purpose
of
lawless'
visit
to
raiford
was
not
to
obtain
the
consent
as
he
testified
to
extend
the
statute
limitation
but
merely
to
obtain
a
sample
of
the
defendant's
handwriting
under
the
guise
of
a
civil
routine
tax
investigation,
when
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
material
was
being
used
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
evidence
of
criminal
wrongdoing
that
to
me
poses
an
issue
which
strikes
at
the
very
core
of
constitutional
immunity.
of
course,
the
recurring
argument
made
on
that
type
of
case
is
that
society's
need
for
interrogation
outweighed
the
privilege.
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
the
taxpayer's
own
records
and
statement
represent
the
easiest
shortcut
to
a
criminal
investigation.
now,
this
court
in
gilbert
versus
california
ruled
that
handwriting
samples
not
to
be
evidence
of
testimonial
or
communicative
in
nature,
included
within
the
fifth
amendment
although
mr.
chief
justice
warren
dissented,
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
fortas.
now,
mathis
may
have
had
a
different
aspect,
had
lawless
merely
obtained
mathis'
signature,
but
agent
lawless
went
beyond
that.
what
he
did
was
he
showed
mathis
a
return
and
said,
“is
this
your
signature?”
and
mathis
answered
that
it
was
and
he
said,
“is
this
your
return?”
and
mathis
answered
that
it
was.
to
me
it
cannot
logically
be
argued
that
such
answers
to
such
questions
are
not
evidence
of
testimonial
or
of
a
communicative
nature
included
within
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now,
we're
getting
back
to
agent
derry.
as
early
as
february
6,
1963,
special
agent
derry
of
the
intelligence
division
received
certain
documents.
they
were
later
introduced
in
evidence
as
government's
exhibit
10.
what
these
documents
consisted
of
was
a
letter
which
was
allegedly
written
by
mathis
to
his
wife,
showing
that
he
intended
to
file
two
tax
refunds
for
one
year,
the
year
1962.
now,
this
fact
was
mentioned
by
the
government
in
their
statement,
their
opening
statement
to
the
jury.
the
government
was
permitted
to
use
that
information
against
mathis
to
show
knowledge
and
intent.
and
i
suggest
that
the
internal
revenue
service,
intelligence
division,
became
suspicious
of
mathis
in
february
of
1963,
some
20
or
21
months
before
agent
lawless
made
his
visit
to
raiford.
that
was
on
october
30th
of
1964.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
how
this
letter
was
obtained.
this
letter
was
intercepted
by
sheriff
buckles
of
osceola
county
and
i
assume
that
mathis
at
that
time
was
in
the
county
jail.
buckles
telephoned
agent
derry
and
at
buckles'
request,
agent
derry
made
a
trip
to
kissimmee
to
sheriff
buckles'
office.
the
letter
and
the
two
returns
were
given
to
agent
derry.
and
as
agent
derry
testified,
he
kept
two
returns,
the
two
returns
and
the
letter
in
his
locked
personal
file
until
june
4th
of
1965
when
he
turned
them
over
to
special
agent
shelley.
and
as
i
said
before,
it's
beyond
belief
that
a
trained
and
veteran
criminal
investigator
would
just
put
away
these
documents
and
simply
forget
them.
yet
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
they
found
definite
indications
of
fraud
on
march
10th
of
1965,
which
is
when
they
referred
the
case
to
the
intelligence
division.
now,
the
government
claims
that
agent
lawless
was
stationed
in
the
jacksonville
office
which
is
approximately
100
miles
north
of
orlando.
agent
derry
was
stationed
in
the
orlando
office.
but
i
drove
up
and
i
was
able
to
check
the
distance,
it
is
145
miles
from
orlando
to
jacksonville.
it
is
50
miles
from
jacksonville
to
raiford.
it
is
16
miles
from
orlando
to
kissimmee.
so
then
it
was
only
natural
that
agent
lawless
would
visit
mathis
at
raiford
since
jacksonville
is
much
closer
to
raiford
than
orlando.
now,
our
second
assignment
of
error
is
based
upon
the
court
depriving
the
petitioner
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution
in
refusing
throughout
the
trial
to
hear
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
as
provided
by
the
rule.
and
we
feel
that
this
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
by
judge
choate.
now,
in
challenging
the
legality
of
this
evidence
and
how
it
was
obtained,
trial
counsel
repeatedly
moved
to
suppress
it
and
the
trial
judge,
in
rejecting
that
offer
stated,
“it's
too
late
now.
i
will
hear
it
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
you
can
do
it
later
on
to
suppress
it.
the
evidence
will
probably
come
in.”
and
still
refusing
to
hear
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
trial
judge
further
stated,
“i
will
overrule
that.
you
don't
have
to
advice
everybody
of
his
rights
every
time
you
ask
him
questions.
i
think
we
are
coming
to
that
pretty
quickly
if
the
supreme
court
keeps
on.”
mr.
lorie,
the
trial
lawyer,
responded,
“we
have
come
to
that
in
the
case
of
miranda
versus
arizona,”
and
the
judge
replied,
“
oh
no!
miranda
says
if
you
arrest
a
man
you
have
a
collar
on
him.
you
can
ask
him
any
questions”.
that's
all
it
says.
now,
i
know
of
no
greater
or
stronger
collar
than
one
made
of
rock
and
steel
surrounded
by
armed
guards.
in
any
event,
i
take
the
position
that
had
the
judge
heard
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
that
his
ruling
would
have
been
the
same,
it
would
have
been
denied.
he
was
not
too
happy
with
the
miranda
decision
obviously.
now,
in
denying
the
petitioner
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
his
motion
to
suppress
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
was
highly
prejudicial.
the
jury
was
able
to
hear
throughout
the
testimony
of
certain
government
witnesses
that
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
in
the
florida
state
penitentiary
for
an
unrelated
offense
and
that
to
deny
him
a
motion
to
suppress
outside
their
presence
and
hearing,
certainly
denied
the
petitioner
a
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
now,
in
referring
to
the
incarceration
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
was
just
as
highly
prejudicial
as
informing
the
jury
of
the
defendant's
prior
convictions.
in
pinto
versus
pierce,
389
u.s.
at
page
31
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
this
was
an
application
by
a
state
prisoner
for
habeas
corpus.
the
facts
are
of
their
brief.
pierce
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
a
new
jersey
court.
he
applied
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey.
the
united
states
district
court
granted
the
writ
and
allowed
the
petitioner
a
new
trial
on
the
merits.
what
pierce
was
seeking
was
a
new
trial
because
the
testimony
in
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
incriminating
statement
was
heard
and
determined
by
the
judge
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
third
circuit
affirmed,
saying
that
the
united
states
district
judge
was
plainly
right.
i
asked
this
court
to
wield
and
broaden
miranda
brush
to
effect
the
cure
concerning
the
constitutional
principles
which
are
or
certainly
should
be
applied
to
tax
cases
and
to
the
case
at
bar.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
that
the
conviction
of
mathis
should
be
reversed.
mr.
nicholas
j.
capuano
if
the
court
please,
under
these
circumstances,
i
believe
that
after
careful
consideration,
i’ll
waive
any
rebuttal
that
i
may
have
had
and
i’ll
try
to
put
them
on
the
head.
