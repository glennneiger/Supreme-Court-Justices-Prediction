726,
robert
t.
mathis,
sr.,
petitioner
versus
united

mr.
capuano?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
arriving
to
that
conclusion,
mr.
friedman,
are
you
assuming
that
this
is
a
civil
instead
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
the
agent
is
on
or
does
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
not
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
it
was
a
criminal
investigation,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
you
say
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they're
looking
for
fraud
though,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
we
have
that,
mr.
friedman,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
your
distinction
between
interrogating
a
man
when
he
is
in
prison
and
when
he
is
in
a
police
station.
now,
what
is
the
basis
of
that?
would
you
say
because
of
the
conduct
of
policemen
throughout
the
country
that
has
caused
us
to
make
a
rule
like
miranda
for
police
stations
but
not
for
other
places?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
--
what
we
read
and
what
we
know
shows
that
there
is
just
as
much
cruelty
and
other
things
in
the
state
prisons
as
there
is
in
police
stations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
ask
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
you
have
a
man
in
a
federal
prison
and
the
federal
officer
comes
to
him
and
he's
alone
in
the
cell
and
asked
him
about
some
conduct
of
his
and
the
man
is
looking
forward
to
a
parole
someday
and
isn't
--
didn't
try
to
make
any
enemies
at
that
moment
and
you
think
he
is
in
the
same
position
when
the
federal
agent
comes
to
him
and
talks
to
him,
as
though
he
was
in
his
home,
or
his
office,
or
on
the
street
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
as
being
a
free
agent,
to
do
what
he
wants.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
state
prison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
state
authorities
could
arrest
the
man
and
put
him
in
jail
and
then
have
a
federal
agent
come
and
talk
to
him
and
not
be
obliged
to
give
the
constitutional
warnings
with
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
the
federal
agent
comes
in
to
a
state
penal
institution
where
a
prisoner
is
incarcerated
and
starts
interrogating
him
about
some
crime
that
he
is
investigating?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
don't
think
that
having
that
these
--
having
that
distinction
that
he
is
the
jail
for
one
crime
and
they
come
in
and
talk
to
him
about
another
one,
do
you
think
that
case
distinguishes
it
from
miranda
to
the
extent
that
he
does
not
necessarily
have
to
have
information
as
to
his
constitutional
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
talking
it
would
make
any
difference,
a
little
while
ago.
it
would
make
any
difference,
whether
this
was
mere
routines,
civil
interrogation,
or
whether
it
was
a
criminal
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
old
“mutt
and
jeff”
way
of
doing
things,
you
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
friendly
way
and
i
just
want
a
little
information
and
so
forth,
that
was
inherent
in
miranda
but
they
didn't
have
to
beat
them
in
order
to
bring
into
effect
the
miranda
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
reason
i
asked
if
you
if
you
made
any
distinction
between
a
criminal
investigation
and
a
civil
and
you
said,
“no,
you
did
not.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
