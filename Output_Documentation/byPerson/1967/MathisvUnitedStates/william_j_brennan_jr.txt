justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
freidman.
i’m
looking
at
the
instructions
at
page
97
that
last
full
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
the
trial
judge
did
regard
this
defendant
as
having
been
in
custody
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
sufficiently
so
that
he
charged
the
jury
that
he
was
not
--
because
he
was
in
custody,
required
to
make
any
reply
to
any
accused
or
a
statement
or
any
question
addressed
to
him
relative
to
any
circumstance
of
which
may
be
embraced
in
the
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
judge
has
made
no
distinction
between
the
two
interviews,
has
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
isn’t
this
broad
enough
mr.
freidman
that’s
true
that
he
says
in
the
last
sentence
and
i
believe
in
one
case,
in
the
one
instance
a
witness
stated
that
he
did
fail
to
answer
a
question
or
he
did
express
a
desire
not
to
answer
any
question?
but
before
that,
it’s
a
rather
general
instruction
as
to
the
consequence
of
his
being
in
custody
in
relation
to
the
jury’s
consideration
that
--
that
would
apply
as
well
to
the
first
interview
and
the
second
interview.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
to
the
first
interview,
would
you
say
that
this
--
at
least
this
is
the
first
interview,
this
instruction
was
on
this,
sir?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don’t
know
whether
this
was
a
requested
instruction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event
and,
as
far
as
it
applies
to
the
first
interview,
the
government’s
position
would
be
that
the
defendant
got
more
than
he
was
entitled
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
in
a
way
of
an
instruction,
he
got
more
than
he
was
entitled
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as

as
that
has
