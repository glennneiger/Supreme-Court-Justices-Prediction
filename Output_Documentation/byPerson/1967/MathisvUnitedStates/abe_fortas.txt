justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose,
the
problem
may
be
reflected
in
judge
thornburg's
statement
on
page
7
of
the
record,
the
opinion
on
the
fifth
circuit,
where
he
says
the
evidence
clearly
reflects
until
march
10
when
appellant's
case
--
and
that
was
after
these
interviews
you
referred
to
--
the
inquiry
involving
appellant's
tax
returns
representing
no
more
than
a
routine
civil
tax
investigation.
justice
abe
fortas
we
don't
have
any
instructions
here,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
--
if
we
should
decide
that
the
point
of
law
here
has
to
be
determined
with
reference
to
the
formation
of
an
intent
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
agents,
to
pursue
this
is
a
criminal
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
to
go
to
the
record
of
the
testimony
itself
and
pierce
through
the
statement
of
the
fifth
circuit.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happens,
mr.
friedman,
to
a
person
who
is
interrogated
by
a
revenue
agent
and
he
refuse
to
abide
his
income
tax
return
and
he
just
refuses
to
talk.
now,
is
that
likely
to
be
followed
by
jeopardy
assessment
tying
up
his
bank
account?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
pressure
at
all
on
the
person
to
come
clean
to
the
revenue
agent
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
you
what
should
be.
i'm
asking
you
what
is.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
penalties?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
penalties?
does
one's
cooperation
or
lack
of
cooperation
with
the
revenue
agent
have
anything
to
do
whatever
with
respect
to
penalties?
justice
abe
fortas
yet,
to
your
knowledge
--
well
i'm
going
to
you
ask
you
to
your
knowledge,
ask
me
what
the
facts
are
with
respect
to
the
law
and
the
practice
with
your
client
and
i
want
to
know
specifically
whether
a
taxpayer's
cooperation
or
non-cooperation
with
the
revenue
agent
investigating
tax
return,
has
anything
whatever
could
do
with
the
likelihood
that
a
jeopardy
assessment
will
be
placed
on
his
property
whether
it
has
anything
to
do
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
likelihood
of
penalties.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
asking
you
about
general
policy
and
practice
and
i
hope
--
and
i'm
sure
that
if
you
discover
from
the
service
that
what
you've
just
said
requires
modification
that
you
will
sort
--
justice
abe
fortas
sure.
thank
you
so
much.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
freidman,
they
were
in
investigating
conventional
sort
of
income
tax
return
violation
here,
were
they?
what
they
were
doing
was
investigating
the
making
of
a
false
claim
for
refund?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
false
claim
for
refund
did
not
give
rise
to
any
tax
liability,
did
it?
in
other
words,
would
they
--
they
wouldn't
be
conducting
a
civil
investigation
in
connection
with
a
suspicion
that
a
man
had
filed
a
false
claim
of
this
nature
for
refund,
would
they?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
freidman,
i
have
two
short
questions.
did
i
understand
you
yesterday
to
say
that
when
the
special
agent
as
distinguished
from
the
revenue
agent
goes
to
a
taxpayer,
that
the
special
agent
who
works
out
of
the
intelligence
branch,
i
gather,
always
gives
a
miranda
warning?
justice
abe
fortas
now
my
second
question
is
whether
when
the
revenue
agent
here,
mister
--
what
was
his
name,
lawless
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
referred
this
matter
to
the
intelligence
branch.
he
did
that
with
a
recommendation
that
a
criminal
investigation
be
begun
or
that
criminal
prosecution
be
instituted.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
means
that
by
that
time
he
made
the
reference
over,
he
had
some
basis
for
thinking
that
there
might
have
been
a
violation,
a
criminal
violation
here.
