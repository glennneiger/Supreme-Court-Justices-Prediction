mr.
lester
m.
ponder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
restate
the
question
as
appellee
sees
the
question
before
the
court.
whether
the
offenses
were
committed
on
the
due
dates
for
filing
prescribed
by
statute
without
regard
to
extensions
of
time
for
filing
or
on
the
dates
the
returns
were
actually
filed.
it
is
the
position
of
the
appellees
that
the
offenses
were
committed
and
thus,
the
periods
of
limitation
begun
to
run
on
the
due
dates
for
filing
prescribed
by
statute
without
regard
to
extensions
of
time
for
filing
as
held
by
the
district
court.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
these
two
counts
involved
two
separate
charges.
the
first
charge
is
that
when
your
honor
has
just
mentioned.
the
other
count
is
7206(4)
which
is
for
assisting
or
aiding
or
bidding
in
the
preparation
of
a
false
return.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
say
that
under
the
rule
laid
down
by
congress
in
the
statute
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
mr.
justice
white,
we
say
this
is
a
statutory
plan,
first,
and
i
think
we
all
would
agree
on
that,
both
sides
that
is,
then
we
say
that
congress
can
fix
the
date
for
the
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
--
why?
we
think
because
congress
felt
that
there
should
be
a
policy
of
repose,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
scharton
case.
we
feel
that
congress
also
intended
a
uniform
rule
to
apply.
and
as
i
will
develop,
the
uniform
rule
is
accepted
by
the
parties
except
in
this
one
situation,
that
is,
that
the
various
possibilities,
early
returns.
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
government
accepts
the
fact
that
the
statutory
due
date
applies
there
and
that
that
often
develops
a
result
in
a
longer
period
than
six
years
being
permitted
for
the
prosecution
of
the
offense.
if
no
return
is
filed,
no
return.
the
statutory
due
date,
it
is
agreed
by
the
parties
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
--
used
the
date
excuse
me,
if
it
is
filed
on
the
due
date
itself,
april
15,
that
would
be,
of
course,
the
six-year.
then
this
one
situation
where
the
extension
is
granted,
we
believe
that
congress
in
the
statute
6531,
incorporating
by
reference
the
rules,
and
i
want
to
get
to
that,
the
rules
not
6513(a)
but
the
rules
of
6513.
we
believe
that
congress
intended
to
set
a
one
uniform
date
that
everybody
would
know
under
the
policy
reposed
for
statutory
grant
is
the
fix
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
our
position,
that
it
is
deemed
to
be
filed
on
the
statutory
due
date
as
we
think
the
statute
says
without
regard
to
extensions
granted.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
think
not.
we
think
if
the
extensions
went,
you
mean
additional
of
60
days,
90
days
or
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
that
the
time
for
the
six-year
running
would
relate
to
--
would
be
the
date
to
expire
the
statute
for
that
return
to
have
been
filed,
had
it
been
filed
on
time
without
an
extension
granted.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
after
--
at
anytime
after,
of
course,
obviously
the
offense
was
committed
under
our
position
on
the
statutory
due
date
for
purposes
of
fixing
the
period
of
limitations.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
question
is,
the
grand
jury,
of
course,
could
not
indict
obviously
until
a
false
return
had
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
i
would
say.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
i
think
that's
correct.
for
the
period
of
limitations,
we
say
as
to
when
that
indictment
can
be
returned,
which
is
our
only
question
here.
the
six
years
runs
from
the
judge
to
do
that
but
of
course,
on
the
indictment,
you're
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
in
that
feeling,
that
it
would
be
not
until
the
return
was
filed.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
but
i
might
say
by
the
same
token
where
no
return
is
filed
falsely,
fraudulently,
the
six-year
period
there.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
another
offense
from
the
statutory
due
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
from
the
statutory
due
date?
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
in
any
event,
we
say
regardless
of
the
extension
and
that's
what
these
lower
court
cases
as
counsel
has
point
out
say
the
alper
case,
involved
the
man
who
got
an
extension
and
strangely
enough
then
didn't
file
at
all.
you
see
falsely
failed
to
file
but
those
cases
hoped
that
the
running
of
the
six-year
period
is
only
from
the
statutory
due
date.
for
example,
april
15
in
the
normal
case
of
an
individual
on
a
calendar
year
basis.
well,
as
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
he
would
be
entitled
to
interest
and
that
would
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
from
that
would
be,
i
believe,
on
interest
from
date
of
payment.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
right.
but
you
see,
for
limitation
purposes,
he
wouldn't
have
to
bring
--
filed
his
refund
claim
even
though
he'd
file
his
return
early
until
running
from
april
15.
but
as
i
would
like
to
point
out,
i'm
coming
to
that
portion
of
argument,
we
believe
that
the
mistake
of
the
government's
interpretation
or
one
mistake
at
least
is
interpreting
this
provision
in
the
criminal
section
and
that's
6531,
exactly
the
way
they
would
interpret
it,
right
or
wrong
solely
as
a
civil
statute.
and
that
is,
i
say,
is
a
point
a
want
to
come
to
it.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
it
would
be
one
month.
we
say
that
it
would
relate
back
to
the
original
date.
however,
your
honor,
he
would
be
subject
to
being
indicted
as
we
understand
the
code
for
a
failure
to
file
on
time.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
another
offense.
then
it's
another
offense
but
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
it
to
be
one
month.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
right.
i
might
say
this,
as
your
honor
would
perceive,
its
likelihood
of
waiting
such
a
long
period
and
then
filing
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
but
we
say
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
result.
however,
and
not
to
labor
it,
there
are
many
indictments
as
well
known
for
failure
to
file
on
time.
that
was
fraudulently
failing
to
file
it
on
the
due
date.
it
can
be
indicted
of
course
one
year
later,
two
years
later,
three
years
later
or
up
to
the
six
years?
so
i
say
that
those
indictments
are
returned
in
situations
where
no
return
was
filed
on
time
even
though
there
could
be
a
delinquent
return
filed
several
years
later.
but
the
failure
to
file
--
and
perhaps
a
correct
return
filed
delinquent
two,
three
or
four
years
later.
but
the
offense
was
failure
to
file
a
timely
return
with
fraudulent
intent.
in
other
words
that
you
do
not
cure
the
fraudulent
intent
for
failure
to
file
by
filing
a
correct
return
delinquent.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
six
years
from
the
due
date,
which
we
say
is
the
rule
in
every
situation
and
we
believe
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
--
the
congress
intended
to
establish
a
uniform
rule.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
that
the
rule
would
be
the
same
whether
he
got
--
yes,
your
honor,
whether
he
got
an
extension
or
didn't
get
an
extension.
whether
he
filed
late,
is
that
without
regard
to
statures
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
we
think
that
stems
from
the
basic
position
that
the
offense
was
committed
on
the
filing
due
date
and
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
it
puts
taxpayers
who
do
not
get
extensions
and
file
late
of
the
same
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
no,
because
we
read
that
--
we
read
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
read
that,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
believe
--
we
believe
it
does
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted
the
taxpayer
then
as
we
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
so,
we
say
that
that
doesn't
--
the
one
who
gets
an
extension
is
in
the
same
footing
under
that
provision
as
the
one
who
didn't.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that
we
think
that
puts
him
on
the
very
same
footing.
now,
as
i've
pointed
out,
we
believe
that
the
scope
of
the
application
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
must
be
determined
by
their
meaning
in
their
section
6531
criminal
context.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government's
approach
is
to
examine
section
6513
and
more
particularly
section
6513(a)
independent
of
section
6531.
and,
further,
the
government's
approach
is
to
interpret
section
6513(a)
entirely
in
its
civil
context
for
which,
of
course,
section
6513
was
drafted
and
enacted.
but
now,
we
say,
6513
being
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
section
6531
a
criminal
prosecution
statute,
we
say,
we
submit
that
the
appellant
has
misread
its
interpretation
by
applying
the
civil
context
entirely
and
omitting
any
interpretation
that
involves
its
criminal
context
that
goes
by
this
incorporation
by
reference.
these
rules,
we
think,
take
on
a
new
concern,
namely,
“determining
the
periods
of
limitation
on
criminal
prosecutions”.
hence,
we
think,
any
of
the
limitations
imposed
on
these
rules
of
section
6513
in
their
civil
meaning,
which
are
not
in
accord
with
these
purposes
of
section
6531
must
be
disregarded.
further,
appellees
urged
that
the
rules
--
that's
the
language
--
rules
of
section
6513
were
intended
to
provide
uniformity
in
fixing
the
period
on
limitation
on
criminal
tax
prosecution.
we
believe
that
a
reading
of
section
6513
in
its
entirety
now
not
6513(a)
alone
because
6531
doesn't
say
6513(a).
it
says
the
rules
of
6513.
we
believe
that
that
shows
an
intention
by
congress
to
provide
a
uniform
rule
for
determining
the
crucial
question
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted.
now,
appellees
urged
that
this
provision
in
section
6531
was
new
in
the
1954
revenue
code.
therefore,
up
until
that
time,
there
would
have
been
no
dispute
on
this
point
as
i
understand
the
law
that
the
government's
position
would
have
been
correct
at
time
a
return
is
filed,
the
date
of
it
starts
the
statute
of
limitations
running.
but
congress
did
something
different
when
it
enacted
the
‘54
code
on
criminal
prosecutions
by
adding
this
provision
this
very
last
provision
that's
been
quoted
so
often
in
6531.
and
we
believe
that
thereby,
the
congress
intended
6513
to
be
read
as
it
says,
rules
control
the
interpretation
of
criminal
prosecutions.
now,
when
congress
--
we
believe
your
honors,
when
congress
has
intended
the
result
pressed
by
the
government
here,
it
has
directly
said
so.
for
example,
in
subsection
(a)
of
section
6501
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
sets
forth
the
general
rule
of
limitations
on
assessment
and
collections,
it
is
provided
that
taxes
“shall
be
assessed
within
three
years
after
the
return
was
filed
whether
or
not
such
return
was
filed
on
or
after
or
after
the
date
prescribed”.
hence,
only
when
the
congress
has
clearly
and
expressly
said
for
such
rule
as
it
did
in
6501(a)
should
the
construction
urged
by
the
government
be
adopted
that
this
is
a
criminal
case,
it
is
crucial
in
resolving
the
question
here
since
the
rules
of
section
6513
are
here
part
of
a
limitation
statute
for
a
statutory
crime.
they
are
to
be
liberally
interpreted
in
favor
of
repose
as
said
in
the
scharton
case
in
1932.
this
means,
we
believe,
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
in
their
civil
context
that
the
purposes
should
be
disregarded
to
the
extent
they
are
not
in
conformity
with
the
criminal
limitation
purposes
of
6531
and
the
general
policy
are
reposed
governing
statutory
crimes.
in
support
of
our
interpretation
also,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
just
the
word
“section
6513”
or
“section
6513(a)”
with
its
varying
civil
associations
and
ramifications
which
is
incorporated
in
the
section
6531.
it
is
instead,
as
congress
used
the
word,
its
rules
that
are
so
incorporated.
we
believe
that
clearly,
congress
advisedly
used
the
phrase
“rules
of
section
6513”
rather
than
simply
saying
section
6513
or
it
could
have
said,
as
appellate
contends,
just
6513(a).
because
if
we
read
all
of
that
section,
we
believe
that
the
interpretation
will
show
that
it
is
a
broader
concept
than
the
narrow
civil
interpretation
could
be
by
picking
sentence
apart.
now,
we
believe
that
the
rules
of
this
section
relevant
to
this
appeal
are
two.
first,
the
rule
that
is
several
times
set
forth
in
section
6513,
in
(b)
and
(c)
and
not
only
in
(a),
that
in
certain
circumstances,
returns
are
deemed
filed
and
certain
payments
made
on
the
due
date
for
filing
or
payment
prescribed
by
statute.
second,
the
rule,
which
is
in
the
last
sentence
of
subsection
(a),
which
states
that
extensions
of
time
are
to
be
disregarded
in
determining
the
due
date
prescribed
by
a
statute”.
this
rule,
we
believe,
puts
persons
charged
with
tax
crime
with
respect
to
returns
for
which
the
extensions
of
time
were
granted
on
the
same
footing
for
purposes
only
of
determining
periods
on
limitation
as
those
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
you're
right.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
don't
say
solely
by
reference,
your
honor.
that's
where
we
disagree
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
your
question
perhaps
illustrates
one
phase
of
this
problem
and
that
is
the
drafting
of
a
civil
branch
on
a
criminal
tree.
in
other
words,
in
6531,
we
have
the
criminal
tree,
as
you've
said
the
three
years
or
the
six
years
punishment
--
i
mean
period
depending
on
the
offense.
then
when
congress
says,
but
we
incorporate
by
reference
the
rules,
the
rules
now
whatever
that
interpretation
should
be
into
sections
6531
and
6513
was
enacted,
both
its
predecessor
in
the
‘39
code
and
in
‘54
code
for
civil
purposes.
i
say
we're
now
in
drafting
that
on
the
criminal
tree.
and
we
think
that
that
has
to
be
read
as
i've
said
in
this
interpretation
and
not
in
the
solely
civil.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
correct,
your
honor.
right.
now,
let
me
say
this.
the
government
has
no
difficulty
in
saying
the
deemed
filed
rule
is
the
offense
committed
date
for
early
returns.
they
say
that's
what
6513
says
and
we
agree.
we
say
abridged
both
ways
is
the
difference
between
us.
they
have
no
--
i
say,
no
difficulty
in
criminal
instruction.
do
you
know
the
return
is
filed
january
2nd,
your
honor?
the
six-year
period,
the
offense
is
not
committed
under
the
government's
position
and
we
would
agree
until
april
15
which
is
three-and-a-half
months
later.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that's
what
the
congress
intended
of
course,
to
make
again
a
uniform
date.
and
we
all
know
it's
difficult
to
adopt
as
we
strive
constantly
to
interpret
some
of
the
statutory
provisions
and
each
time
they
are
fragmented
into
a
different
due
date
or
different
effective
date,
we
think
that
congress
just
didn't
intend
that
and
when
it
intended
it,
it
said
so.
it
has
said
it
many
other
times.
i
only
cite
one
instance.
it
can
say
so
and
it
knows
how
to.
so,
we
think
that
when
the
government
argues
on
brief
for
example,
that
our
position
extends
the
statute
of
limitations,
it
doesn't
extend
it
that's
making
the
question.
the
statute
is
six
years
but
as
your
honors
has
said,
mr.
white
--
justice
white,
six
years
from
what
date
just
as
six
years
on
an
early
return
or
six
years
where
no
return?
we
believe
that
that
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that
it
went
on
and
said
but
disregards
extensions.
we
believe
the
congress
incorporated
the
entire
section
and
not
only
(a)
but
the
others
that
all
seem
we
think
point
to
a
uniform
prescribed
due
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
from
the
government's
argument,
i
would
feel
that
they're
saying
that
for
purposes
of
the
civil
context
entirely
and
reading
it
for
purposes
of
this
subsection.
i
think
it
could
be
subject
to
that
interpretation,
for
that
civil
purpose
only
and
i
think
it
also
could
be
argued
the
other
way.
i
think
it
has
--
it
could
be
argued
the
other
way.
i
do
want
though
to
point
out,
before
my
time
expires,
one
thing
on
legislative
history.
now,
they're
just
--
there
is
no
legislative
history
here
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
question
despite
the
statement
of
the
appellant.
the
reference
by
the
appellant
to
the
1942
legislative
history
is
not
relevant
here.
that
was
with
respect
to
the
predecessor
of
section
6513
solely
in
its
civil
context,
12
years
before
this
provision
in
question
was
put
into
section
6531.
so
congress
couldn't
have
had
any
meaning
in
mind
with
respect
to
the
criminal
prosecution
period
of
limitations,
12
years
before
it
enacted
the
very
section
6531,
that
we're
here
concerned
with
primarily,
that
is
how
long
does
the
statute
run.
there
was
no
reference
back.
there
was
no
such
provision
or
any
incorporation
by
reference
until
1954.
secondly,
of
course,
we
think
that
that
language
in
the
congressional
reports
in
the
‘42
amendment
dealt
solely
with
its
civil
context
again
and
could
have
had
no
bearing
on
the
criminal.
and
it
has
to
be,
we
think,
examined
in
the
light
of
the
criminal
provision.
now,
we
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
again,
back
to
as
when
is
the
offense
committed,
which
of
course
is
a
crucial
question
or
the
crucial
question.
the
this
offense
is
not
--
as
i
said,
statutory.
therefore,
the
date
and
the
way
of
committing
it
is
not
an
innately
human
act
but
is
a
statutorily
defined
act,
of
course.
therefore,
we
think,
it
is
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
to
say
that
the
statutory
due
date
deemed
filed
which
admittedly
and
no
one
disputes
it,
applies
at
early
returns,
and
would
likewise
apply
to
late
returns.
we
believe
that
the
government
here
is
thus
urging
a
dual
standard
result:
the
statutory
filing
date
for
returns
filed
early
and
the
actual
physical
filing
date
for
returns
filed
late.
and
if
the
congress
had
intended
such
a
result,
we
believe,
it
would
have
said
so.
on
the
other
hand,
appellees
urged
a
single
stand
to
prove,
namely:
that
the
period
of
limitations
run
from
the
statutory
due
date
for
filing
regardless
of
whether
the
return
was
filed
early,
late
or
on
the
due
date
itself.
one
prescribed
date.
and
we
believe
that
when
the
congress
changed
the
applicable
statutory
provisions
in
1954,
it
intended
this
single
standard
rule
result.
in
other
words,
we
feel,
that
the
appellant
is
reading
section
6531
as
follows,
the
applicable
provision.
we
think
he
is
reading
it
this
way
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
periods
of
limitation
when
on
criminal
prosecutions
with
respect
to
early
returns
the
rules
of
section
6513
shall
be
applicable.
now,
congress
could
have
said
so
and
it
has
said
so
in
other
sections
of
the
code.
and
we
believe
that
it
had
an
intended
to
say
so
here,
it
would
have
done
it
in
plain,
unmistakable
light.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
restate
the
question
as
appellee
sees
the
question
before
the
court.
whether
the
offenses
were
committed
on
the
due
dates
for
filing
prescribed
by
statute
without
regard
to
extensions
of
time
for
filing
or
on
the
dates
the
returns
were
actually
filed.
it
is
the
position
of
the
appellees
that
the
offenses
were
committed
and
thus,
the
periods
of
limitation
begun
to
run
on
the
due
dates
for
filing
prescribed
by
statute
without
regard
to
extensions
of
time
for
filing
as
held
by
the
district
court.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
these
two
counts
involved
two
separate
charges.
the
first
charge
is
that
when
your
honor
has
just
mentioned.
the
other
count
is
7206(4)
which
is
for
assisting
or
aiding
or
bidding
in
the
preparation
of
a
false
return.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
say
that
under
the
rule
laid
down
by
congress
in
the
statute
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
mr.
justice
white,
we
say
this
is
a
statutory
plan,
first,
and
i
think
we
all
would
agree
on
that,
both
sides
that
is,
then
we
say
that
congress
can
fix
the
date
for
the
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
--
why?
we
think
because
congress
felt
that
there
should
be
a
policy
of
repose,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
scharton
case.
we
feel
that
congress
also
intended
a
uniform
rule
to
apply.
and
as
i
will
develop,
the
uniform
rule
is
accepted
by
the
parties
except
in
this
one
situation,
that
is,
that
the
various
possibilities,
early
returns.
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
government
accepts
the
fact
that
the
statutory
due
date
applies
there
and
that
that
often
develops
a
result
in
a
longer
period
than
six
years
being
permitted
for
the
prosecution
of
the
offense.
if
no
return
is
filed,
no
return.
the
statutory
due
date,
it
is
agreed
by
the
parties
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
--
used
the
date
excuse
me,
if
it
is
filed
on
the
due
date
itself,
april
15,
that
would
be,
of
course,
the
six-year.
then
this
one
situation
where
the
extension
is
granted,
we
believe
that
congress
in
the
statute
6531,
incorporating
by
reference
the
rules,
and
i
want
to
get
to
that,
the
rules
not
6513(a)
but
the
rules
of
6513.
we
believe
that
congress
intended
to
set
a
one
uniform
date
that
everybody
would
know
under
the
policy
reposed
for
statutory
grant
is
the
fix
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
our
position,
that
it
is
deemed
to
be
filed
on
the
statutory
due
date
as
we
think
the
statute
says
without
regard
to
extensions
granted.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
think
not.
we
think
if
the
extensions
went,
you
mean
additional
of
60
days,
90
days
or
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
that
the
time
for
the
six-year
running
would
relate
to
--
would
be
the
date
to
expire
the
statute
for
that
return
to
have
been
filed,
had
it
been
filed
on
time
without
an
extension
granted.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
after
--
at
anytime
after,
of
course,
obviously
the
offense
was
committed
under
our
position
on
the
statutory
due
date
for
purposes
of
fixing
the
period
of
limitations.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
question
is,
the
grand
jury,
of
course,
could
not
indict
obviously
until
a
false
return
had
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
i
would
say.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
i
think
that's
correct.
for
the
period
of
limitations,
we
say
as
to
when
that
indictment
can
be
returned,
which
is
our
only
question
here.
the
six
years
runs
from
the
judge
to
do
that
but
of
course,
on
the
indictment,
you're
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
in
that
feeling,
that
it
would
be
not
until
the
return
was
filed.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
but
i
might
say
by
the
same
token
where
no
return
is
filed
falsely,
fraudulently,
the
six-year
period
there.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
another
offense
from
the
statutory
due
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
from
the
statutory
due
date?
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
in
any
event,
we
say
regardless
of
the
extension
and
that's
what
these
lower
court
cases
as
counsel
has
point
out
say
the
alper
case,
involved
the
man
who
got
an
extension
and
strangely
enough
then
didn't
file
at
all.
you
see
falsely
failed
to
file
but
those
cases
hoped
that
the
running
of
the
six-year
period
is
only
from
the
statutory
due
date.
for
example,
april
15
in
the
normal
case
of
an
individual
on
a
calendar
year
basis.
well,
as
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
he
would
be
entitled
to
interest
and
that
would
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
from
that
would
be,
i
believe,
on
interest
from
date
of
payment.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
right.
but
you
see,
for
limitation
purposes,
he
wouldn't
have
to
bring
--
filed
his
refund
claim
even
though
he'd
file
his
return
early
until
running
from
april
15.
but
as
i
would
like
to
point
out,
i'm
coming
to
that
portion
of
argument,
we
believe
that
the
mistake
of
the
government's
interpretation
or
one
mistake
at
least
is
interpreting
this
provision
in
the
criminal
section
and
that's
6531,
exactly
the
way
they
would
interpret
it,
right
or
wrong
solely
as
a
civil
statute.
and
that
is,
i
say,
is
a
point
a
want
to
come
to
it.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
it
would
be
one
month.
we
say
that
it
would
relate
back
to
the
original
date.
however,
your
honor,
he
would
be
subject
to
being
indicted
as
we
understand
the
code
for
a
failure
to
file
on
time.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
another
offense.
then
it's
another
offense
but
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
it
to
be
one
month.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
right.
i
might
say
this,
as
your
honor
would
perceive,
its
likelihood
of
waiting
such
a
long
period
and
then
filing
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
but
we
say
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
result.
however,
and
not
to
labor
it,
there
are
many
indictments
as
well
known
for
failure
to
file
on
time.
that
was
fraudulently
failing
to
file
it
on
the
due
date.
it
can
be
indicted
of
course
one
year
later,
two
years
later,
three
years
later
or
up
to
the
six
years?
so
i
say
that
those
indictments
are
returned
in
situations
where
no
return
was
filed
on
time
even
though
there
could
be
a
delinquent
return
filed
several
years
later.
but
the
failure
to
file
--
and
perhaps
a
correct
return
filed
delinquent
two,
three
or
four
years
later.
but
the
offense
was
failure
to
file
a
timely
return
with
fraudulent
intent.
in
other
words
that
you
do
not
cure
the
fraudulent
intent
for
failure
to
file
by
filing
a
correct
return
delinquent.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
six
years
from
the
due
date,
which
we
say
is
the
rule
in
every
situation
and
we
believe
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
--
the
congress
intended
to
establish
a
uniform
rule.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
say
that
the
rule
would
be
the
same
whether
he
got
--
yes,
your
honor,
whether
he
got
an
extension
or
didn't
get
an
extension.
whether
he
filed
late,
is
that
without
regard
to
statures
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
we
think
that
stems
from
the
basic
position
that
the
offense
was
committed
on
the
filing
due
date
and
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
it
puts
taxpayers
who
do
not
get
extensions
and
file
late
of
the
same
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
no,
because
we
read
that
--
we
read
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
read
that,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
believe
--
we
believe
it
does
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted
the
taxpayer
then
as
we
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
so,
we
say
that
that
doesn't
--
the
one
who
gets
an
extension
is
in
the
same
footing
under
that
provision
as
the
one
who
didn't.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that
we
think
that
puts
him
on
the
very
same
footing.
now,
as
i've
pointed
out,
we
believe
that
the
scope
of
the
application
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
must
be
determined
by
their
meaning
in
their
section
6531
criminal
context.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government's
approach
is
to
examine
section
6513
and
more
particularly
section
6513(a)
independent
of
section
6531.
and,
further,
the
government's
approach
is
to
interpret
section
6513(a)
entirely
in
its
civil
context
for
which,
of
course,
section
6513
was
drafted
and
enacted.
but
now,
we
say,
6513
being
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
section
6531
a
criminal
prosecution
statute,
we
say,
we
submit
that
the
appellant
has
misread
its
interpretation
by
applying
the
civil
context
entirely
and
omitting
any
interpretation
that
involves
its
criminal
context
that
goes
by
this
incorporation
by
reference.
these
rules,
we
think,
take
on
a
new
concern,
namely,
“determining
the
periods
of
limitation
on
criminal
prosecutions”.
hence,
we
think,
any
of
the
limitations
imposed
on
these
rules
of
section
6513
in
their
civil
meaning,
which
are
not
in
accord
with
these
purposes
of
section
6531
must
be
disregarded.
further,
appellees
urged
that
the
rules
--
that's
the
language
--
rules
of
section
6513
were
intended
to
provide
uniformity
in
fixing
the
period
on
limitation
on
criminal
tax
prosecution.
we
believe
that
a
reading
of
section
6513
in
its
entirety
now
not
6513(a)
alone
because
6531
doesn't
say
6513(a).
it
says
the
rules
of
6513.
we
believe
that
that
shows
an
intention
by
congress
to
provide
a
uniform
rule
for
determining
the
crucial
question
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted.
now,
appellees
urged
that
this
provision
in
section
6531
was
new
in
the
1954
revenue
code.
therefore,
up
until
that
time,
there
would
have
been
no
dispute
on
this
point
as
i
understand
the
law
that
the
government's
position
would
have
been
correct
at
time
a
return
is
filed,
the
date
of
it
starts
the
statute
of
limitations
running.
but
congress
did
something
different
when
it
enacted
the
‘54
code
on
criminal
prosecutions
by
adding
this
provision
this
very
last
provision
that's
been
quoted
so
often
in
6531.
and
we
believe
that
thereby,
the
congress
intended
6513
to
be
read
as
it
says,
rules
control
the
interpretation
of
criminal
prosecutions.
now,
when
congress
--
we
believe
your
honors,
when
congress
has
intended
the
result
pressed
by
the
government
here,
it
has
directly
said
so.
for
example,
in
subsection
(a)
of
section
6501
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
sets
forth
the
general
rule
of
limitations
on
assessment
and
collections,
it
is
provided
that
taxes
“shall
be
assessed
within
three
years
after
the
return
was
filed
whether
or
not
such
return
was
filed
on
or
after
or
after
the
date
prescribed”.
hence,
only
when
the
congress
has
clearly
and
expressly
said
for
such
rule
as
it
did
in
6501(a)
should
the
construction
urged
by
the
government
be
adopted
that
this
is
a
criminal
case,
it
is
crucial
in
resolving
the
question
here
since
the
rules
of
section
6513
are
here
part
of
a
limitation
statute
for
a
statutory
crime.
they
are
to
be
liberally
interpreted
in
favor
of
repose
as
said
in
the
scharton
case
in
1932.
this
means,
we
believe,
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
in
their
civil
context
that
the
purposes
should
be
disregarded
to
the
extent
they
are
not
in
conformity
with
the
criminal
limitation
purposes
of
6531
and
the
general
policy
are
reposed
governing
statutory
crimes.
in
support
of
our
interpretation
also,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
just
the
word
“section
6513”
or
“section
6513(a)”
with
its
varying
civil
associations
and
ramifications
which
is
incorporated
in
the
section
6531.
it
is
instead,
as
congress
used
the
word,
its
rules
that
are
so
incorporated.
we
believe
that
clearly,
congress
advisedly
used
the
phrase
“rules
of
section
6513”
rather
than
simply
saying
section
6513
or
it
could
have
said,
as
appellate
contends,
just
6513(a).
because
if
we
read
all
of
that
section,
we
believe
that
the
interpretation
will
show
that
it
is
a
broader
concept
than
the
narrow
civil
interpretation
could
be
by
picking
sentence
apart.
now,
we
believe
that
the
rules
of
this
section
relevant
to
this
appeal
are
two.
first,
the
rule
that
is
several
times
set
forth
in
section
6513,
in
(b)
and
(c)
and
not
only
in
(a),
that
in
certain
circumstances,
returns
are
deemed
filed
and
certain
payments
made
on
the
due
date
for
filing
or
payment
prescribed
by
statute.
second,
the
rule,
which
is
in
the
last
sentence
of
subsection
(a),
which
states
that
extensions
of
time
are
to
be
disregarded
in
determining
the
due
date
prescribed
by
a
statute”.
this
rule,
we
believe,
puts
persons
charged
with
tax
crime
with
respect
to
returns
for
which
the
extensions
of
time
were
granted
on
the
same
footing
for
purposes
only
of
determining
periods
on
limitation
as
those
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
sir.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
you're
right.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
we
don't
say
solely
by
reference,
your
honor.
that's
where
we
disagree
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
your
question
perhaps
illustrates
one
phase
of
this
problem
and
that
is
the
drafting
of
a
civil
branch
on
a
criminal
tree.
in
other
words,
in
6531,
we
have
the
criminal
tree,
as
you've
said
the
three
years
or
the
six
years
punishment
--
i
mean
period
depending
on
the
offense.
then
when
congress
says,
but
we
incorporate
by
reference
the
rules,
the
rules
now
whatever
that
interpretation
should
be
into
sections
6531
and
6513
was
enacted,
both
its
predecessor
in
the
‘39
code
and
in
‘54
code
for
civil
purposes.
i
say
we're
now
in
drafting
that
on
the
criminal
tree.
and
we
think
that
that
has
to
be
read
as
i've
said
in
this
interpretation
and
not
in
the
solely
civil.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
correct,
your
honor.
right.
now,
let
me
say
this.
the
government
has
no
difficulty
in
saying
the
deemed
filed
rule
is
the
offense
committed
date
for
early
returns.
they
say
that's
what
6513
says
and
we
agree.
we
say
abridged
both
ways
is
the
difference
between
us.
they
have
no
--
i
say,
no
difficulty
in
criminal
instruction.
do
you
know
the
return
is
filed
january
2nd,
your
honor?
the
six-year
period,
the
offense
is
not
committed
under
the
government's
position
and
we
would
agree
until
april
15
which
is
three-and-a-half
months
later.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that's
what
the
congress
intended
of
course,
to
make
again
a
uniform
date.
and
we
all
know
it's
difficult
to
adopt
as
we
strive
constantly
to
interpret
some
of
the
statutory
provisions
and
each
time
they
are
fragmented
into
a
different
due
date
or
different
effective
date,
we
think
that
congress
just
didn't
intend
that
and
when
it
intended
it,
it
said
so.
it
has
said
it
many
other
times.
i
only
cite
one
instance.
it
can
say
so
and
it
knows
how
to.
so,
we
think
that
when
the
government
argues
on
brief
for
example,
that
our
position
extends
the
statute
of
limitations,
it
doesn't
extend
it
that's
making
the
question.
the
statute
is
six
years
but
as
your
honors
has
said,
mr.
white
--
justice
white,
six
years
from
what
date
just
as
six
years
on
an
early
return
or
six
years
where
no
return?
we
believe
that
that
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that
it
went
on
and
said
but
disregards
extensions.
we
believe
the
congress
incorporated
the
entire
section
and
not
only
(a)
but
the
others
that
all
seem
we
think
point
to
a
uniform
prescribed
due
date.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
well,
from
the
government's
argument,
i
would
feel
that
they're
saying
that
for
purposes
of
the
civil
context
entirely
and
reading
it
for
purposes
of
this
subsection.
i
think
it
could
be
subject
to
that
interpretation,
for
that
civil
purpose
only
and
i
think
it
also
could
be
argued
the
other
way.
i
think
it
has
--
it
could
be
argued
the
other
way.
i
do
want
though
to
point
out,
before
my
time
expires,
one
thing
on
legislative
history.
now,
they're
just
--
there
is
no
legislative
history
here
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
question
despite
the
statement
of
the
appellant.
the
reference
by
the
appellant
to
the
1942
legislative
history
is
not
relevant
here.
that
was
with
respect
to
the
predecessor
of
section
6513
solely
in
its
civil
context,
12
years
before
this
provision
in
question
was
put
into
section
6531.
so
congress
couldn't
have
had
any
meaning
in
mind
with
respect
to
the
criminal
prosecution
period
of
limitations,
12
years
before
it
enacted
the
very
section
6531,
that
we're
here
concerned
with
primarily,
that
is
how
long
does
the
statute
run.
there
was
no
reference
back.
there
was
no
such
provision
or
any
incorporation
by
reference
until
1954.
secondly,
of
course,
we
think
that
that
language
in
the
congressional
reports
in
the
‘42
amendment
dealt
solely
with
its
civil
context
again
and
could
have
had
no
bearing
on
the
criminal.
and
it
has
to
be,
we
think,
examined
in
the
light
of
the
criminal
provision.
now,
we
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
again,
back
to
as
when
is
the
offense
committed,
which
of
course
is
a
crucial
question
or
the
crucial
question.
the
this
offense
is
not
--
as
i
said,
statutory.
therefore,
the
date
and
the
way
of
committing
it
is
not
an
innately
human
act
but
is
a
statutorily
defined
act,
of
course.
therefore,
we
think,
it
is
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
to
say
that
the
statutory
due
date
deemed
filed
which
admittedly
and
no
one
disputes
it,
applies
at
early
returns,
and
would
likewise
apply
to
late
returns.
we
believe
that
the
government
here
is
thus
urging
a
dual
standard
result:
the
statutory
filing
date
for
returns
filed
early
and
the
actual
physical
filing
date
for
returns
filed
late.
and
if
the
congress
had
intended
such
a
result,
we
believe,
it
would
have
said
so.
on
the
other
hand,
appellees
urged
a
single
stand
to
prove,
namely:
that
the
period
of
limitations
run
from
the
statutory
due
date
for
filing
regardless
of
whether
the
return
was
filed
early,
late
or
on
the
due
date
itself.
one
prescribed
date.
and
we
believe
that
when
the
congress
changed
the
applicable
statutory
provisions
in
1954,
it
intended
this
single
standard
rule
result.
in
other
words,
we
feel,
that
the
appellant
is
reading
section
6531
as
follows,
the
applicable
provision.
we
think
he
is
reading
it
this
way
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
periods
of
limitation
when
on
criminal
prosecutions
with
respect
to
early
returns
the
rules
of
section
6513
shall
be
applicable.
now,
congress
could
have
said
so
and
it
has
said
so
in
other
sections
of
the
code.
and
we
believe
that
it
had
an
intended
to
say
so
here,
it
would
have
done
it
in
plain,
unmistakable
light.
thank
you
very
much.
