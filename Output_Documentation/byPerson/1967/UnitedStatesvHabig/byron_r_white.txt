justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
offense
you
say
is
--
the
offense
is
committed
before
the
return
has
ever
filed
or
before
it's
ever
prepared?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
the
congress
laid
down
a
rule
like
that?
that's
kind
of
silly,
isn't
it
to
say
the
offense
is
committed
before
it's
ever
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
five
grounds
of
count,
i
just
wonder
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
file
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
in
the
unlikely
event,
successive
extensions
went
beyond
the
limitations
period
where
you
could
file
a
false
return
of
impunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
the
statute
limitation
for
failure
to
file
a
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
ponder
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
take
it
that
the
basic
rule
that
you're
dealing
with
is
6531
which
sets
the
statute
limitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
either
three
or
six
years
i
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
position
does
require
us
to
interpret
6531
to
mean
that
the
offense
is
committed
in
your
case
on
the
date
set
for
the
filing
of
the
return
without
regard
for
when
it
was
ever
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
are
asked
to
say
that
the
offense
was
committed
at
this
earlier
time
solely
by
reference
to
the
last
sentence
of
6513.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
is
an
awfully
backhand
way
of
saying
that
the
offense
will
be
deemed
committed
on
the
day
set
for
filing
the
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
--
but
in
any
event,
we
have
to
say
the
offense
--
in
that
effect
the
offense
was
committed
on
a
certain
earlier
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
at
least
congress
said
expressly
that
the
cases
of
early
returns,
it
shall
be
deemed
to
be
filed
on
the
last
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
what
is
your
understanding
on
the
government's
argument
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
last
sentence
of
6513?
what
meaning
do
you
think
the
government
gives
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
say
once
again
what
do
you
think
the
point
of
the
last
sentence
is
in
6513?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
reading
the
statute?
justice
byron

so
the

you
say
is

has
ever
filed

it's
