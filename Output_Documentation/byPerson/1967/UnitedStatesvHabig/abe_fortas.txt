justice
abe
fortas
are
there
a
lot
of
cases
that
present
this
pinpoint
question?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
but
i
meant
that
there
are
a
lot
of
pending
indictments
which
raised
this
question.
justice
abe
fortas
because
you
would
assume
that
the
united
states
would
somehow
rather
be
able
to
spur
the
fact
curiously
and
not
so
as
to
eliminate
this
question
of
six
years
in
which
to
bring
these
actions.
justice
abe
fortas
right
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
no
i'm
not
raising
that
obviously
since
the
promoting
the
fact,
the
operation
of
the
democratic
principle
would
never
do
anything
until
the
last
possible
moment
and
that
it
has
created
this
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
what
effect
would
you
give
to
the
last
paragraph
of
6531
quoted
in
your
brief
on
page
3
that
is
where
it
says,
“for
purposes
of
determining
the
page
of
limitation
on
criminal
prosecutions,
the
rules
of
section
6513
should
be
applicable”?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
doesn't
that
then
mean
that
the
third
sentence
of
6513(a)
has
no
meaning
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
unless
you
give
that
third
sentence
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
have
this
difficulty
of
fitting
that
into
the
language?
i
don't
say
we
can
do
that
on
the
basis
of
the
language
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
followed
you
when
you
are
making
that
argument
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
statute
of
--
to
pay
the
limitation
begins
at
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
return,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
general
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
and
the
6531
in
the
criminal
section
says
that
you
determine
time
by
reference
to
6513.
if
you
look
at
6513,
6513
purports
to
describe
the
date
for
legal
purposes
and
would
be
considered
the
date
when
the
return
was
filed,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
says
--
you
know
the
third
sentence
of
it
says
that
the
date
on
which
a
return
will
be
filed
will
be
considered
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted
and
the
fact
that
it's
preceded
by
the
phrase
“for
purposes
of
this
subsection”
and
it
seemed
to
me
they
help
you
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
because
for
purposes
of
this
subsection,
clearly,
is
not
limited
to
early
return
or
advance
payment
of
tax
despite
of
studying,
otherwise,
there's
been
no
purpose
in
that
third
sentence.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i'm
trying
--
i'm
telling
you
what
my
problem
is.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
--
that's
not
a
very
realistic
illustration,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
realistic
illustration,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
rule
--
what's
the
rule
mr.
ponder,
if
you
know
several
purposes?
suppose
a
tax
return
is
filed
and
payment
made
before
the
statutory
date
for
filing
and
the
taxpayer
later
brings
a
suit
for
refund,
is
he
entitled
to
interest
on
that,
isn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
from
what
date?
justice
abe
fortas
from
the
date
of
payment?
justice
abe
fortas
what
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
a
taxpayer
did
not
get
any
extension
of
time,
he
would
not
get
any
assistance
from
the
third
sentence
of
6513,
would
he?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
basis
of
that?
what's
the
basis
of
that
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
an
offense
of
filing
a
--
of
not
filing
at
all?
in
fact
--
but
suppose
the
offense
for
filing
a
fraudulent
return,
taxpayer
did
not
get
an
extension
of
time
from
the
bureau,
from
the
internal
revenue
service,
then
in
the
fifth
year,
he
files
a
fraudulent
return
and
then
the
offense
of
filing
of
fraudulent
return
that
the
period
of
limitations
would
not
relate
back,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
where
do
you
get
that?
that's
why
i
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
certainly
doesn't
could
follow
from
third
sentence
of
6513(a).
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
follow
from
the
third
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
saying
he
didn't
get
any
extension
of
time.
justice
abe
fortas
oh.
