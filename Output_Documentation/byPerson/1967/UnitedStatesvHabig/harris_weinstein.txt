mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana,
dismissing
two
counts
of
a
seven-count
indictment
brought
under
the
revenue
laws,
dismissing
on
grounds
of
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
question
here
is
on
what
date
did
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
apply
to
these
two
counts
begin
to
run?
the
choices
are
two;
was
it
the
date
when
the
returns
were
in
fact
filed
after
the
statutory
deadline
but
during
a
period
of
extension
granted
by
the
commissioner?
or
did
the
limitations
period
begin
to
run
on
the
earlier
date
when
the
statutory
deadline
came?
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
it
involves
the
tax
returns
--
these
two
counts
involved
the
tax
returns
of
two
corporations,
the
gordonsville
company
and
the
kimball
company.
each
was
reporting
its
income
on
a
fiscal
year
basis,
reporting
for
the
year
ending
with
february
so
that
the
return
due
to
be
filed
in
1960
related
to
the
taxable
year
ending
february
29,
1960.
under
the
statute,
those
two
corporate
returns
were
due
to
be
filed
on
may
15,
1960.
instead
of
filing
at
that
time,
the
two
corporations
asked
for
and
obtained
a
three-month
extension
of
time
for
filing
until
august
15,
1960.
then
on
august
12
of
that
year,
the
kimball
return
was
filed.
three
days
later
on
the
extended
deadline,
august
15th,
the
gordonsville
return
was
filed.
the
indictment
was
brought
in
on
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
filing
of
the
kimball
return
on
august
12,
1966.
if
the
statute
began
to
run
when
the
return
was
filed,
the
indictment
relating
to
these
two
returns
was
timely,
otherwise,
it
wasn't.
the
indictment
in
seven
counts
has
seven
counts.
each
one
relating
to
a
corporate
return
filed
on
behalf
of
one
of
five
corporations.
in
count
4,
the
one
that
relates
to
gordonsville,
it
charges
that
the
appellees
attempted
to
evade
and
defeat
tax
due
from
gordonsville
by
filing
a
false
and
fraudulent
returns.
count
6,
the
other
one
that
was
dismissed,
relates
to
the
kimball
return
filed
on
august
1960.
it
charges
that
the
appellees
falsely
and
fraudulently
overstated
kimball's
gross
receipts
in
that
return.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
terms
of
when
the
statute
begins
to
run,
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
harris
weinstein
under
the
tax
code
sections,
i'm
aware
of
a
handful
and
i'm
only
aware
of
three
in
addition
to
this
case
that
we
think
are
pertinent
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
four.
one
is
the
hull
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
against
us.
the
others
are
the
doelker
case
and
alper
case,
i
believe
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
our
information
of
the
importance
of
this
as
i
recall
is
that
there,
i
believe,
we're
told
that
approximately
a
dozen
cases
a
year
arise
where
the
return
was
filed
during
extended
period
of
time
and
the
indictment
is
brought
and
after
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
statutory
due
date.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
of
course,
the
prosecution
could
be
brought
within
five
years
and
nine
months.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
that
were
the
statute,
i
imagine,
many
more
of
them
would
be
brought
within
five
years
and
nine
months.
of
course,
this
case
though
isn't
as
simple
as
the
ordinary
one
might
be.
i
don't
know
the
underlying
facts
and
the
record
was
never
developed
to
show
them
in
detail
before
these
counts
were
dismissed.
but
it
does
involve
seven
tax
returns,
all
filed
in
this
august,
corporations
that
the
record
doesn't
show
the
relationship
of
them
but
the
appellee
habig
was
apparently
present
of
all
five
and
the
other
appellee
had
some
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
tax
returns.
and
i
think,
the
records
of
all
kinds
of
tax
cases
indicate
the
reasons
why
congress
thought
that
some
extended
period
was
necessary
to
investigate
tax
fraud.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
won't
speak
in
defense
of
that
principle.
i'd
rather
rely
on
the
statutory
language,
if
i
may,
and
the
first
statute
that
we
point
to
in
this
case
is
section
6531
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
establishes
the
basic
six-year
period
of
limitations
in
this
kind
of
case.
and
towards
the
beginning
of
this
provision,
it
says
that
the
period
of
limitation
shall
be
six
years
in
classes
of
crimes
that
are
covered
by
these
two
counts
and
the
context
makes
clear
that
the
six
years
is
the
six
years
next
after
the
commission
of
the
offense.
the
other
part
of
the
statute
of
6531
as
an
issue
here
is
the
very
last
sentence
and
it
reads
“for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
periods
of
limitation
on
criminal
prosecutions,
the
rules
of
section
6513
should
be
applicable.”
and
the
precise
and
narrow
question
here
is.
what
are
these
rules
of
section
6513?
do
any
of
them
apply
to
bar
the
prosecution
in
this
case?
section
6513
itself
states
a
variety
of
rules
for
creating
deemed
times
or
artificial
times
of
filing
returns
or
payment
of
tax
to
determine
when
in
the
civil
context
and
other
connected
sections
on
that
part
of
the
code
when
a
suit
for
refund
must
--
a
claim
for
refund
must
be
filed
or
a
suit
filed
in
the
tax
court
for
redertermination.
the
only
part
of
section
6513
that
is
invoked
here
is
the
first
part,
6513(a).
the
government's
contention,
i
think,
is
simple
as
that
the
first
two
words
in
the
title
of
the
subsection
resolve
the
case
and
that
everything
else
in
the
case
is
consistent
with
and
confirms
that
view.
those
two
words
are
‘early
return'.
the
entire
title
of
this
subsection
(a)
is
‘early
return
or
advance
payment
of
tax'.
there
are
three
sentences
in
this
section.
the
first
one
and
the
second
one
are
very
similar,
except
that
the
first
one
deals
with
advance
filings,
which
is
the
early
return
in
the
title.
the
second
one
deals
with
advance
payments
or
the
advance
payment
of
tax
in
the
title.
the
first
--
now,
the
first
sentence
says,
for
the
purposes
of
section
6511,
which
deals
with
claims
for
refund
and
limits
on
refunds
and
credits,
any
return
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
for
the
filing
thereof
shall
be
considered
as
filed
on
such
last
day.
the
second
sentence
is
very
similar,
again
referring
to
other
sections
in
this
vicinity
of
the
code
relating
to
limits
on
credits
and
the
like.
it
says,
for
purposes
of
section
6511(b)
(2)
and
(c)
in
6512,
payment
of
any
portion
of
the
tax
made
before
the
last
day
prescribed
for
the
payment
of
the
tax
shall
be
considered
made
on
such
last
day.
both
of
these
sentences
have
the
same
operative
phrase,
“before
the
last
day
prescribed”;
and
the
first
sentence
“last
day
prescribed
for
filing”
and
the
second
“for
payment”.
now,
in
the
abstract,
viewing
these
two
sentences
alone,
this
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
can
have
several
meanings
because
deadlines
under
the
tax
code
are
prescribed
in
several
ways.
it
could
mean
the
day
prescribed
by
statute
as
in
the
case
of
income
tax
returns,
prescribed
by
regulations
as
in
the
case
of
certain
excised
taxes.
it
could
mean
deadlines
for
payment
of
tax
prescribed
by
elections
that
the
taxpayer
can
make
such
as
under
certain
state
tax
provisions
or
could
mean
the
last
day
prescribed
by
extensions
given
by
the
commissioner
under
his
discretionary
authority.
this
function
of
the
third
sentence,
in
our
view,
the
third
and
last
sentence
of
this
section
is
to
define
and
to
delimit
this
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
occurs
in
each
of
the
first
two
sentences.
the
full
text
of
that
very
sentence
is
for
purposes
of
this
subsection.
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
the
return
or
paying
the
tax
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted
the
taxpayer
and
without
regard
to
any
election
to
pay
the
tax
in
installments.
now,
as
the
government
has
read
the
statute
and
as
the
government
has
urged
the
courts
to
construe
it,
the
purpose
and
the
only
purpose
of
this
last
sentence
is
to
eliminate
two
of
the
four
possible
meanings
of
the
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
appears
in
the
first
two
sentences.
so
that
with
this
third
sentence,
the
first
two
sentences
mean
that
an
early
return
is
only
that
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
by
statute
or
regulations.
it
does
not
define
as
an
early
return,
one
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
by
this
in
extension
of
time.
it
does
not
--
it
takes
outside
the
word
“advance
payment
of
tax,”
a
payment
made
after
the
statutory
or
regulation
deadline
based
on
the
taxpayer's
election
to
pay
in
installments.
so
it
means
that
this
section
prescribes
rules
only
for
returns
filed,
payments
made
before
deadlines
prescribed
by
statute
or
regulation.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
supports
this
view.
the
committee
reports,
when
this
language
was
first
inserted
in
‘39
code
and
‘42,
the
committee
report
on
section
6513(a)
when
it
was
continued
in
the
1954
code,
both
made
clear
that
this
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
practical
effect,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
practical
effect
is
that
for
the
great
mass
of
us
who
file
our
tax
returns
sometime
between
january
1st
and
april
15th,
it
gives
the
government
a
uniform
expiration
date
six
years
from
that
april
15th
and
it
has
a
similar
effect
in
the
other
areas
of
tax
law.
what
this
--
our
reading
of
this
third
sentence,
thus,
it
say
that
those
people
who
file
after
april
15th
count
their
six
years
from
the
day
they
actually
filed.
and
this
--
in
terms
of
the
great
group
of
taxpayers,
this
works
advantageous
for
both
sides;
it
gives
taxpayers
counsel
a
uniformed
deadline
to
work
against
in
filing
claims
refund
or
suing
on
the
tax
court
and
it
gives
the
commissioner's
people
a
uniformed
deadline
to
work
against
in
auditing
most
tax
returns
for
a
given
year.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
so
i
can't
cite
you
the
statistics
but
i'm
confident
that
they
are
relatively
rare.
now,
we
don't
understand
the
appellees
to
disagree
with
this
reading
of
the
statute
for
civil
purposes.
they
never
concede
that
it's
correct
for
civil
purposes
but
they
don't
dispute
it
and
they
suggest
that
it
may
be
correct
for
civil
purposes.
but
their
position
is
that
it
has
a
somewhat
different
meaning
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas,
i
think,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
answer
that
is
to
refer
to
the
case
of,
i
believe,
the
united
states
against
schettz
in
earlier
case
in
the
same
district
court
that
this
court
thought
compelled
the
result
have
reached.
in
a
similar
case,
i
believe,
united
states
against
black
i
think
in
the
district
of
missouri.
these
were
cases,
i
don't
remember
the
precise
days
but
essentially
this
is
what
happened.
allegedly,
false
returns
were
filed
in
january
when
they
were
doing
april
and
that
the
indictment
was
brought
six
years
later
but
after
january
or
in
february
or
march
or
april.
but
before
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
april
15th
statutory
deadline
and
the
courts
ruled
on
those
cases
and
of
course,
the
government
urged
them
to
that
the
government's
--
the
effect
of
this
last
sentence
was
to
give
the
government
a
little
more
than
six
years.
it
was
whenever
the
taxpayer
filed
his
tax
return
plus
the
amount
of
time
between
that
day
and
the
statutory
deadline
of
april
15
or
whatever
it
might
have
been
in
the
particular
in
this
case.
and
this
is
a
reading
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
means
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
has
this
meaning,
justice
fortas
in
the
criminal
context.
in
this
case,
one
of
the
returns,
i
believe
the
kimball
return,
was
filed
on
august
12,
1960
where
the
extension
of
time,
as
i
recall,
went
to
august
15.
because
of
that
third
sentence,
the
extension
of
time
to
august
15th
had
to
be
ignored.
if
the
indictment
had
been
brought
in
on
august
14th
that
would
have
been
too
late,
whereas
if
in
the
absence
of
this
third
sentence,
indictment
could
have
been
brought
in
at
anytime
up
to
august
15,
1966.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
i
--
perhaps,
if
we
took
this
example,
assume
that
you
have
the
extension
of
time
to
august
15?
it's
a
discretionary
extension
of
time.
it's
not
a
statutory
deadline
because
it's
a
corporation
the
commissioner
has
--
there
are
restrictions
on
his
discretion
to
extend
the
time
but
it's
still
an
extension.
that's
not
fully
a
matter
of
right.
the
function
of
this
last
sentence,
as
we
read
it,
is
to
define
the
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”.
our
contention
is
that
this
sentence
in
itself
is
not
a
distinct
rule
of
section
6513.
that
it
defines
the
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”
found
in
the
first
two
sentences.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
points
you
suggested
in
our
--
i
think
our
answers
to
them
are
independent
and
we
don't
necessarily
lose
on
one
because
we
lose
on
the
other.
you've
indicated
that
you
disagree
with
our
reading
of
this
phrase
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection”.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
if
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
okay.
well,
this
--
we
understand
this
subsection
to
be
incorporated
in
total
in
section
6531.
we
don't
understand
each
sentence
to
be
separately
incorporated.
we
assume
that
when
6531
talks
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
that
means
that
the
rules
are
those
that
are
otherwise
established
by
6513
read
by
itself
for
its
original
purpose.
and
now
--
the
only
rules
they
state,
in
our
view,
apply
only
when
a
return
is
filed
or
the
tax
paid
before
the
last
day
prescribed.
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
word/phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”,
we
read
this
last
sentence
as
defined.
but
let's
assume
that
that's
not
the
correct
reading
of
that
third
sentence
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
consequences
of
it
because
i
think
that
it
brings
into
focus
some
of
the
difficulties
with
the
district
courts
ruling
here.
if
you
eliminate
this
phrase
“for
purposes
of
this
subsection”,
all
this
third
sentence
says
as
in
filing
returns
is
concerned.
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
the
return
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time.
now,
how
does
that
apply
to
this
case
to
determine
that
the
commission
of
the
offense
was
earlier
than
the
date
on
which
the
return
was
filed?
all
this
says
is
that
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension.
the
day
prescribed
for
filing
is
in
no
way
an
element
of
proof
in
the
offense
charged
in
these
two
counts
of
the
indictment.
the
fact
to
be
proved
is
that
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
was
filed.
until
that
return
is
filed,
there's
no
offense.
no
offense
has
been
committed.
no
prosecution
could
be
brought.
the
--
the
logic
of
transposing
these
words
into
a
general
rule
applicable
to
this
case
would
be
to
say
that
these
offenses
were
committed
on
may
15,
1960.
but
any
--
no
conviction
could
have
been
brought
under
any
set
of
facts
existing
on
may
15
at
least
under
the
indictment
word
such
as
this
one.
now,
i
also
think
this
brings
to
mind
the
way
this
rule
has
developed
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
its
origins,
which
are
in
two
district
court
cases
involving
a
different
charge,
the
charge
of
failure
to
file
a
return
at
all.
if
you
were
dealing
with
that
particular
charge
and
if
you
excise
for
present
purposes
that
first
part
of
the
statute,
then
you
would
have
a
rule
that
on
its
face
could
be
applied
to
that
criminal
charge
of
failure
to
file
because
for
failure
to
file,
you
must
prove
as
an
essential
element
the
date
prescribed
for
filing.
but
the
way
the
rule
would
be
applied,
as
we
see
it,
has
an
illogic
that
suggests
that
isn't
what
congress
meant.
take
an
example
of
one
of
these
cases,
which
i
think
is
the
alper
case
in
the
district
of
new
jersey.
here,
a
return
was
filed
and
then
before
the
statutory
deadline.
i
beg
your
pardon.
no
return
was
filed
before
the
statutory
deadline.
an
extension
of
time
was
granted.
at
the
end
of
the
extended
time,
still
no
return
was
filed
and
the
case
itself
involved
the
pleading
problem.
the
--
and
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
the
offense
of
failing
to
file
committed
on
the
date
that
the
return
should
have
been
filed
under
the
statute
or
the
later
date
under
the
extended
time.
now,
the
court
held,
and
we
think
erroneously,
that
the
offense
was
committed
at
the
time
the
return
should
have
been
filed
under
the
statute.
and
the
reason
that
we
think
that's
erroneous
is
because
of
this
example
and
this
is
why
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
can
be
read
in
the
way
you
suggest,
justice
fortas.
suppose
a
tax
return
is
due
on
april
15th
and
instead
of
filing,
the
taxpayer
asked
and
gets
an
extension
to
june
15th.
and
on
june
15th,
he
files
his
return
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
under
the
reading
of
the
court
below,
he
could
still
be
charged
with
the
failure
to
file
because
he
had
not
filed
his
return
on
april
15th
when
it
was
due
under
the
statute
without
regard
to
any
extension
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
simply
not
a
logical
reading
of
congressional
intent
unless
there's
a
very
specific
language
defining
as
a
crime
the
failure
to
file
in
the
presence
of
a
duly
granted
the
extension.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
it's
a
realistic
in
the
sense
that
this
is
the
contention
that's
been
made.
it's
the
holding
the
court
has
reached
and
it
is
a
progenitor
of
the
decision
here
if
you
trace
these
cases
from
their
beginning
to
their
end.
language
taken
out
of
context
in
cases
such
as
that
has
been
relied
on
by
the
courts
here
and
this
--
one
might
not
expect
that
contention
but
it
has
been
made
by
defendants
in
defense,
asserting
that
they
should
have
been
charged
earlier
than
they
were.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
legislative
history
on
the
criminal
provision
itself
tracks
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
on
6513(a)
makes
it
clear
that
it
was
speaking
of
early
returns
and
these
committee
reports
are
quoted.
one
--
there's
one
in
1942
and
one
in
1954,
i
believe,
and
they're
set
out
to
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
the
first
committee
report
when
the
language
was
first
drafted
has
this
sentence,
“this
provision,”
speaking
of
the
predecessor
6513(a),
“this
provision
does
not
apply
to
taxpayers
for
given
the
benefit
for
an
extension
of
time
in
which
to
file
their
returns
and
file
the
return
before
the
last
day
of
the
extended
period.”
i
think
that
the
appellees
recognized
it
to
reach
their
result.
they
need
a
rather
different
reading
for
criminal
prosecutions
than
you
have
in
civil
cases.
they
suggest
to
somewhat
different
analysis
than
the
courts
have
used.
they
rely,
instead
of
going
just
the
third
sentence,
they
say
that
the
combined
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
say
that
returns
are
to
be
deemed
file
on
a
statutory
due
date
no
matter
when
they're
filed.
we
suggest
that
this
reading
requires
the
word
“before”
be
excised
from
the
first
two
sentences.
they
would
read
the
sentence
as
though
any
return
filed
other
than
on
the
last
day
prescribed
shall
be
deemed
filed
on
that
date.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
result
below
is
not
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
if
i
may
briefly
make
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
terms
of
what
the
offense
is
charged
here
are,
they
both
go
to
the
filing
of
false
returns.
section
--
count
4
of
the
indictment
speaks
of
an
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
tax
by
filing
a
false
return.
count
6,
brought
under
another
section
of
the
statute
speaks
of,
i
believe,
procuring
the
preparation
and
presentation
of
a
false
return.
the
--
and
presentation,
of
course,
i
assume
is
equivalent
with
filing
a
false
return.
the
other
point
is
we
do
not
suggest
that
6513(a)
for
any
purpose
defines
when
the
offense
is
committed.
it's
a
towing
provision
and
nothing
else.
it's
a
provision
--
for
example,
in
the
case
of
the
early
return,
under
the
appellees'
reading,
if
the
return
were
filed
on
january
15,
no
crime
would
be
committed
until
april
15
and
a
prosecution
brought
in
february
or
march
wouldn't
be
possible.
we
suggest
that
this
is
just
another
illogic
in
the
reading.
when
the
--
when
the
crime
is
committed,
when
the
offense
is
committed,
it's
determined
by
when
the
returned
is
filed.
and
the
sole
effect
of
6513
just
as,
say
sections
of
the
law,
relating
to
the
defendants
out
of
the
jurisdiction
tows
the
running
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
define
when
the
crime
is
committed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
solely
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
solely
to
define
the
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
appears
in
each
of
the
first
two
sentences
and
to
eliminate
two
of
the
four
possible
meanings
from
that
phrase
which
in
turn
defines
what
is
meant
by
“early
return”
or
advanced
payment.
and
our
submission
is
that
that
is
all
it
means
in
its
civil
context.
it
can't
be
no
more
or
no
less
in
its
criminal
context.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana,
dismissing
two
counts
of
a
seven-count
indictment
brought
under
the
revenue
laws,
dismissing
on
grounds
of
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
question
here
is
on
what
date
did
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
apply
to
these
two
counts
begin
to
run?
the
choices
are
two;
was
it
the
date
when
the
returns
were
in
fact
filed
after
the
statutory
deadline
but
during
a
period
of
extension
granted
by
the
commissioner?
or
did
the
limitations
period
begin
to
run
on
the
earlier
date
when
the
statutory
deadline
came?
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
it
involves
the
tax
returns
--
these
two
counts
involved
the
tax
returns
of
two
corporations,
the
gordonsville
company
and
the
kimball
company.
each
was
reporting
its
income
on
a
fiscal
year
basis,
reporting
for
the
year
ending
with
february
so
that
the
return
due
to
be
filed
in
1960
related
to
the
taxable
year
ending
february
29,
1960.
under
the
statute,
those
two
corporate
returns
were
due
to
be
filed
on
may
15,
1960.
instead
of
filing
at
that
time,
the
two
corporations
asked
for
and
obtained
a
three-month
extension
of
time
for
filing
until
august
15,
1960.
then
on
august
12
of
that
year,
the
kimball
return
was
filed.
three
days
later
on
the
extended
deadline,
august
15th,
the
gordonsville
return
was
filed.
the
indictment
was
brought
in
on
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
filing
of
the
kimball
return
on
august
12,
1966.
if
the
statute
began
to
run
when
the
return
was
filed,
the
indictment
relating
to
these
two
returns
was
timely,
otherwise,
it
wasn't.
the
indictment
in
seven
counts
has
seven
counts.
each
one
relating
to
a
corporate
return
filed
on
behalf
of
one
of
five
corporations.
in
count
4,
the
one
that
relates
to
gordonsville,
it
charges
that
the
appellees
attempted
to
evade
and
defeat
tax
due
from
gordonsville
by
filing
a
false
and
fraudulent
returns.
count
6,
the
other
one
that
was
dismissed,
relates
to
the
kimball
return
filed
on
august
1960.
it
charges
that
the
appellees
falsely
and
fraudulently
overstated
kimball's
gross
receipts
in
that
return.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
terms
of
when
the
statute
begins
to
run,
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
harris
weinstein
under
the
tax
code
sections,
i'm
aware
of
a
handful
and
i'm
only
aware
of
three
in
addition
to
this
case
that
we
think
are
pertinent
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
four.
one
is
the
hull
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
against
us.
the
others
are
the
doelker
case
and
alper
case,
i
believe
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
our
information
of
the
importance
of
this
as
i
recall
is
that
there,
i
believe,
we're
told
that
approximately
a
dozen
cases
a
year
arise
where
the
return
was
filed
during
extended
period
of
time
and
the
indictment
is
brought
and
after
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
statutory
due
date.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
of
course,
the
prosecution
could
be
brought
within
five
years
and
nine
months.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
that
were
the
statute,
i
imagine,
many
more
of
them
would
be
brought
within
five
years
and
nine
months.
of
course,
this
case
though
isn't
as
simple
as
the
ordinary
one
might
be.
i
don't
know
the
underlying
facts
and
the
record
was
never
developed
to
show
them
in
detail
before
these
counts
were
dismissed.
but
it
does
involve
seven
tax
returns,
all
filed
in
this
august,
corporations
that
the
record
doesn't
show
the
relationship
of
them
but
the
appellee
habig
was
apparently
present
of
all
five
and
the
other
appellee
had
some
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
tax
returns.
and
i
think,
the
records
of
all
kinds
of
tax
cases
indicate
the
reasons
why
congress
thought
that
some
extended
period
was
necessary
to
investigate
tax
fraud.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
won't
speak
in
defense
of
that
principle.
i'd
rather
rely
on
the
statutory
language,
if
i
may,
and
the
first
statute
that
we
point
to
in
this
case
is
section
6531
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
establishes
the
basic
six-year
period
of
limitations
in
this
kind
of
case.
and
towards
the
beginning
of
this
provision,
it
says
that
the
period
of
limitation
shall
be
six
years
in
classes
of
crimes
that
are
covered
by
these
two
counts
and
the
context
makes
clear
that
the
six
years
is
the
six
years
next
after
the
commission
of
the
offense.
the
other
part
of
the
statute
of
6531
as
an
issue
here
is
the
very
last
sentence
and
it
reads
“for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
periods
of
limitation
on
criminal
prosecutions,
the
rules
of
section
6513
should
be
applicable.”
and
the
precise
and
narrow
question
here
is.
what
are
these
rules
of
section
6513?
do
any
of
them
apply
to
bar
the
prosecution
in
this
case?
section
6513
itself
states
a
variety
of
rules
for
creating
deemed
times
or
artificial
times
of
filing
returns
or
payment
of
tax
to
determine
when
in
the
civil
context
and
other
connected
sections
on
that
part
of
the
code
when
a
suit
for
refund
must
--
a
claim
for
refund
must
be
filed
or
a
suit
filed
in
the
tax
court
for
redertermination.
the
only
part
of
section
6513
that
is
invoked
here
is
the
first
part,
6513(a).
the
government's
contention,
i
think,
is
simple
as
that
the
first
two
words
in
the
title
of
the
subsection
resolve
the
case
and
that
everything
else
in
the
case
is
consistent
with
and
confirms
that
view.
those
two
words
are
‘early
return'.
the
entire
title
of
this
subsection
(a)
is
‘early
return
or
advance
payment
of
tax'.
there
are
three
sentences
in
this
section.
the
first
one
and
the
second
one
are
very
similar,
except
that
the
first
one
deals
with
advance
filings,
which
is
the
early
return
in
the
title.
the
second
one
deals
with
advance
payments
or
the
advance
payment
of
tax
in
the
title.
the
first
--
now,
the
first
sentence
says,
for
the
purposes
of
section
6511,
which
deals
with
claims
for
refund
and
limits
on
refunds
and
credits,
any
return
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
for
the
filing
thereof
shall
be
considered
as
filed
on
such
last
day.
the
second
sentence
is
very
similar,
again
referring
to
other
sections
in
this
vicinity
of
the
code
relating
to
limits
on
credits
and
the
like.
it
says,
for
purposes
of
section
6511(b)
(2)
and
(c)
in
6512,
payment
of
any
portion
of
the
tax
made
before
the
last
day
prescribed
for
the
payment
of
the
tax
shall
be
considered
made
on
such
last
day.
both
of
these
sentences
have
the
same
operative
phrase,
“before
the
last
day
prescribed”;
and
the
first
sentence
“last
day
prescribed
for
filing”
and
the
second
“for
payment”.
now,
in
the
abstract,
viewing
these
two
sentences
alone,
this
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
can
have
several
meanings
because
deadlines
under
the
tax
code
are
prescribed
in
several
ways.
it
could
mean
the
day
prescribed
by
statute
as
in
the
case
of
income
tax
returns,
prescribed
by
regulations
as
in
the
case
of
certain
excised
taxes.
it
could
mean
deadlines
for
payment
of
tax
prescribed
by
elections
that
the
taxpayer
can
make
such
as
under
certain
state
tax
provisions
or
could
mean
the
last
day
prescribed
by
extensions
given
by
the
commissioner
under
his
discretionary
authority.
this
function
of
the
third
sentence,
in
our
view,
the
third
and
last
sentence
of
this
section
is
to
define
and
to
delimit
this
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
occurs
in
each
of
the
first
two
sentences.
the
full
text
of
that
very
sentence
is
for
purposes
of
this
subsection.
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
the
return
or
paying
the
tax
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time
granted
the
taxpayer
and
without
regard
to
any
election
to
pay
the
tax
in
installments.
now,
as
the
government
has
read
the
statute
and
as
the
government
has
urged
the
courts
to
construe
it,
the
purpose
and
the
only
purpose
of
this
last
sentence
is
to
eliminate
two
of
the
four
possible
meanings
of
the
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
appears
in
the
first
two
sentences.
so
that
with
this
third
sentence,
the
first
two
sentences
mean
that
an
early
return
is
only
that
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
by
statute
or
regulations.
it
does
not
define
as
an
early
return,
one
filed
before
the
last
day
prescribed
by
this
in
extension
of
time.
it
does
not
--
it
takes
outside
the
word
“advance
payment
of
tax,”
a
payment
made
after
the
statutory
or
regulation
deadline
based
on
the
taxpayer's
election
to
pay
in
installments.
so
it
means
that
this
section
prescribes
rules
only
for
returns
filed,
payments
made
before
deadlines
prescribed
by
statute
or
regulation.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
supports
this
view.
the
committee
reports,
when
this
language
was
first
inserted
in
‘39
code
and
‘42,
the
committee
report
on
section
6513(a)
when
it
was
continued
in
the
1954
code,
both
made
clear
that
this
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
practical
effect,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
practical
effect
is
that
for
the
great
mass
of
us
who
file
our
tax
returns
sometime
between
january
1st
and
april
15th,
it
gives
the
government
a
uniform
expiration
date
six
years
from
that
april
15th
and
it
has
a
similar
effect
in
the
other
areas
of
tax
law.
what
this
--
our
reading
of
this
third
sentence,
thus,
it
say
that
those
people
who
file
after
april
15th
count
their
six
years
from
the
day
they
actually
filed.
and
this
--
in
terms
of
the
great
group
of
taxpayers,
this
works
advantageous
for
both
sides;
it
gives
taxpayers
counsel
a
uniformed
deadline
to
work
against
in
filing
claims
refund
or
suing
on
the
tax
court
and
it
gives
the
commissioner's
people
a
uniformed
deadline
to
work
against
in
auditing
most
tax
returns
for
a
given
year.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
so
i
can't
cite
you
the
statistics
but
i'm
confident
that
they
are
relatively
rare.
now,
we
don't
understand
the
appellees
to
disagree
with
this
reading
of
the
statute
for
civil
purposes.
they
never
concede
that
it's
correct
for
civil
purposes
but
they
don't
dispute
it
and
they
suggest
that
it
may
be
correct
for
civil
purposes.
but
their
position
is
that
it
has
a
somewhat
different
meaning
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas,
i
think,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
answer
that
is
to
refer
to
the
case
of,
i
believe,
the
united
states
against
schettz
in
earlier
case
in
the
same
district
court
that
this
court
thought
compelled
the
result
have
reached.
in
a
similar
case,
i
believe,
united
states
against
black
i
think
in
the
district
of
missouri.
these
were
cases,
i
don't
remember
the
precise
days
but
essentially
this
is
what
happened.
allegedly,
false
returns
were
filed
in
january
when
they
were
doing
april
and
that
the
indictment
was
brought
six
years
later
but
after
january
or
in
february
or
march
or
april.
but
before
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
april
15th
statutory
deadline
and
the
courts
ruled
on
those
cases
and
of
course,
the
government
urged
them
to
that
the
government's
--
the
effect
of
this
last
sentence
was
to
give
the
government
a
little
more
than
six
years.
it
was
whenever
the
taxpayer
filed
his
tax
return
plus
the
amount
of
time
between
that
day
and
the
statutory
deadline
of
april
15
or
whatever
it
might
have
been
in
the
particular
in
this
case.
and
this
is
a
reading
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
means
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
has
this
meaning,
justice
fortas
in
the
criminal
context.
in
this
case,
one
of
the
returns,
i
believe
the
kimball
return,
was
filed
on
august
12,
1960
where
the
extension
of
time,
as
i
recall,
went
to
august
15.
because
of
that
third
sentence,
the
extension
of
time
to
august
15th
had
to
be
ignored.
if
the
indictment
had
been
brought
in
on
august
14th
that
would
have
been
too
late,
whereas
if
in
the
absence
of
this
third
sentence,
indictment
could
have
been
brought
in
at
anytime
up
to
august
15,
1966.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
i
--
perhaps,
if
we
took
this
example,
assume
that
you
have
the
extension
of
time
to
august
15?
it's
a
discretionary
extension
of
time.
it's
not
a
statutory
deadline
because
it's
a
corporation
the
commissioner
has
--
there
are
restrictions
on
his
discretion
to
extend
the
time
but
it's
still
an
extension.
that's
not
fully
a
matter
of
right.
the
function
of
this
last
sentence,
as
we
read
it,
is
to
define
the
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”.
our
contention
is
that
this
sentence
in
itself
is
not
a
distinct
rule
of
section
6513.
that
it
defines
the
phrase,
“the
last
day
prescribed”
found
in
the
first
two
sentences.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
points
you
suggested
in
our
--
i
think
our
answers
to
them
are
independent
and
we
don't
necessarily
lose
on
one
because
we
lose
on
the
other.
you've
indicated
that
you
disagree
with
our
reading
of
this
phrase
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection”.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
if
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
okay.
well,
this
--
we
understand
this
subsection
to
be
incorporated
in
total
in
section
6531.
we
don't
understand
each
sentence
to
be
separately
incorporated.
we
assume
that
when
6531
talks
of
the
rules
of
section
6513
that
means
that
the
rules
are
those
that
are
otherwise
established
by
6513
read
by
itself
for
its
original
purpose.
and
now
--
the
only
rules
they
state,
in
our
view,
apply
only
when
a
return
is
filed
or
the
tax
paid
before
the
last
day
prescribed.
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
word/phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”,
we
read
this
last
sentence
as
defined.
but
let's
assume
that
that's
not
the
correct
reading
of
that
third
sentence
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
consequences
of
it
because
i
think
that
it
brings
into
focus
some
of
the
difficulties
with
the
district
courts
ruling
here.
if
you
eliminate
this
phrase
“for
purposes
of
this
subsection”,
all
this
third
sentence
says
as
in
filing
returns
is
concerned.
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
the
return
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension
of
time.
now,
how
does
that
apply
to
this
case
to
determine
that
the
commission
of
the
offense
was
earlier
than
the
date
on
which
the
return
was
filed?
all
this
says
is
that
the
last
day
prescribed
for
filing
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
extension.
the
day
prescribed
for
filing
is
in
no
way
an
element
of
proof
in
the
offense
charged
in
these
two
counts
of
the
indictment.
the
fact
to
be
proved
is
that
a
false
and
fraudulent
return
was
filed.
until
that
return
is
filed,
there's
no
offense.
no
offense
has
been
committed.
no
prosecution
could
be
brought.
the
--
the
logic
of
transposing
these
words
into
a
general
rule
applicable
to
this
case
would
be
to
say
that
these
offenses
were
committed
on
may
15,
1960.
but
any
--
no
conviction
could
have
been
brought
under
any
set
of
facts
existing
on
may
15
at
least
under
the
indictment
word
such
as
this
one.
now,
i
also
think
this
brings
to
mind
the
way
this
rule
has
developed
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
its
origins,
which
are
in
two
district
court
cases
involving
a
different
charge,
the
charge
of
failure
to
file
a
return
at
all.
if
you
were
dealing
with
that
particular
charge
and
if
you
excise
for
present
purposes
that
first
part
of
the
statute,
then
you
would
have
a
rule
that
on
its
face
could
be
applied
to
that
criminal
charge
of
failure
to
file
because
for
failure
to
file,
you
must
prove
as
an
essential
element
the
date
prescribed
for
filing.
but
the
way
the
rule
would
be
applied,
as
we
see
it,
has
an
illogic
that
suggests
that
isn't
what
congress
meant.
take
an
example
of
one
of
these
cases,
which
i
think
is
the
alper
case
in
the
district
of
new
jersey.
here,
a
return
was
filed
and
then
before
the
statutory
deadline.
i
beg
your
pardon.
no
return
was
filed
before
the
statutory
deadline.
an
extension
of
time
was
granted.
at
the
end
of
the
extended
time,
still
no
return
was
filed
and
the
case
itself
involved
the
pleading
problem.
the
--
and
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
the
offense
of
failing
to
file
committed
on
the
date
that
the
return
should
have
been
filed
under
the
statute
or
the
later
date
under
the
extended
time.
now,
the
court
held,
and
we
think
erroneously,
that
the
offense
was
committed
at
the
time
the
return
should
have
been
filed
under
the
statute.
and
the
reason
that
we
think
that's
erroneous
is
because
of
this
example
and
this
is
why
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
can
be
read
in
the
way
you
suggest,
justice
fortas.
suppose
a
tax
return
is
due
on
april
15th
and
instead
of
filing,
the
taxpayer
asked
and
gets
an
extension
to
june
15th.
and
on
june
15th,
he
files
his
return
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
under
the
reading
of
the
court
below,
he
could
still
be
charged
with
the
failure
to
file
because
he
had
not
filed
his
return
on
april
15th
when
it
was
due
under
the
statute
without
regard
to
any
extension
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
simply
not
a
logical
reading
of
congressional
intent
unless
there's
a
very
specific
language
defining
as
a
crime
the
failure
to
file
in
the
presence
of
a
duly
granted
the
extension.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
it's
a
realistic
in
the
sense
that
this
is
the
contention
that's
been
made.
it's
the
holding
the
court
has
reached
and
it
is
a
progenitor
of
the
decision
here
if
you
trace
these
cases
from
their
beginning
to
their
end.
language
taken
out
of
context
in
cases
such
as
that
has
been
relied
on
by
the
courts
here
and
this
--
one
might
not
expect
that
contention
but
it
has
been
made
by
defendants
in
defense,
asserting
that
they
should
have
been
charged
earlier
than
they
were.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
legislative
history
on
the
criminal
provision
itself
tracks
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
on
6513(a)
makes
it
clear
that
it
was
speaking
of
early
returns
and
these
committee
reports
are
quoted.
one
--
there's
one
in
1942
and
one
in
1954,
i
believe,
and
they're
set
out
to
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
the
first
committee
report
when
the
language
was
first
drafted
has
this
sentence,
“this
provision,”
speaking
of
the
predecessor
6513(a),
“this
provision
does
not
apply
to
taxpayers
for
given
the
benefit
for
an
extension
of
time
in
which
to
file
their
returns
and
file
the
return
before
the
last
day
of
the
extended
period.”
i
think
that
the
appellees
recognized
it
to
reach
their
result.
they
need
a
rather
different
reading
for
criminal
prosecutions
than
you
have
in
civil
cases.
they
suggest
to
somewhat
different
analysis
than
the
courts
have
used.
they
rely,
instead
of
going
just
the
third
sentence,
they
say
that
the
combined
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
say
that
returns
are
to
be
deemed
file
on
a
statutory
due
date
no
matter
when
they're
filed.
we
suggest
that
this
reading
requires
the
word
“before”
be
excised
from
the
first
two
sentences.
they
would
read
the
sentence
as
though
any
return
filed
other
than
on
the
last
day
prescribed
shall
be
deemed
filed
on
that
date.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
result
below
is
not
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
if
i
may
briefly
make
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
terms
of
what
the
offense
is
charged
here
are,
they
both
go
to
the
filing
of
false
returns.
section
--
count
4
of
the
indictment
speaks
of
an
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
tax
by
filing
a
false
return.
count
6,
brought
under
another
section
of
the
statute
speaks
of,
i
believe,
procuring
the
preparation
and
presentation
of
a
false
return.
the
--
and
presentation,
of
course,
i
assume
is
equivalent
with
filing
a
false
return.
the
other
point
is
we
do
not
suggest
that
6513(a)
for
any
purpose
defines
when
the
offense
is
committed.
it's
a
towing
provision
and
nothing
else.
it's
a
provision
--
for
example,
in
the
case
of
the
early
return,
under
the
appellees'
reading,
if
the
return
were
filed
on
january
15,
no
crime
would
be
committed
until
april
15
and
a
prosecution
brought
in
february
or
march
wouldn't
be
possible.
we
suggest
that
this
is
just
another
illogic
in
the
reading.
when
the
--
when
the
crime
is
committed,
when
the
offense
is
committed,
it's
determined
by
when
the
returned
is
filed.
and
the
sole
effect
of
6513
just
as,
say
sections
of
the
law,
relating
to
the
defendants
out
of
the
jurisdiction
tows
the
running
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
define
when
the
crime
is
committed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
solely
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
solely
to
define
the
phrase
“the
last
day
prescribed”
that
appears
in
each
of
the
first
two
sentences
and
to
eliminate
two
of
the
four
possible
meanings
from
that
phrase
which
in
turn
defines
what
is
meant
by
“early
return”
or
advanced
payment.
and
our
submission
is
that
that
is
all
it
means
in
its
civil
context.
it
can't
be
no
more
or
no
less
in
its
criminal
context.
