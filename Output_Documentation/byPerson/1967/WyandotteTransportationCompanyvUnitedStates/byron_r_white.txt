justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
that
the
wreck
statute
would
have
some
basis
in
declaring
that
after
a
certain
length
of
time
the
vessels
shall
be
declared
--
shall
be
deemed
abandoned,
the
united
states
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
damages
and
providing
a
scheme
whereby
the
secretary
is
or
the
core
is
authorized
to
seek
bids,
things
like
that,
plenty
of
basis
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
it's
superfluous
if
a
wreck
is
an
obstruction
under
10.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that,
the
wreck
statute
speaks
of
wreck
as
some
times
vessels
of
obstruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
section
of
the
wreck
statute,
speaks
of
something
vessels
as
obstruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
section
20?
in
an
emergency
situation
apparently
in
sunken
vessel
the
secretary
may
act
immediately
removing
himself,
then
it
says
if
the
owners,
thereby
fail
to
refuse
reimburse
the
united
states
for
such
expense
within
a
certain
time
then
the
wreck,
the
craft
maybe
sold
and
the
proceeds
go
into
the
treasury,
that
doesn't
indicate
this,
that
indicates
the
ownership
liable
to
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
limit
on
the
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
in
case
of
a
wreck,
something
wreck,
the
united
states
may
not
sit
quietly
by
and
just
sue
in
court.
it's
only
remedy
is
go
remove
that
wreck
itself
if
the
owner
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
been
--
recorded
and
enforced,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
indicated
the
specific
obligation
to
remove
the
wreck
which
is
provided
in
section
15?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
and
i
know
it
that
expressly,
but
that's
the
duty
on
the
owner
to
remove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
criminal
liability
in
this
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
knowing
under
section
10
i
suppose,
i
guess
you
rely
on
both
10
and
15
--
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
--
would
you
suggest
that
the
that
criminal
liability
would
be
just
in
this
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
that
doesn’t
and
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
negligence
is
required
at
all,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
common
law
of
liability,
it
depends
on
negligence
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
statutory
liability,
your
statutory
liability
argument
does
depend
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
--
you
take
it
under
10
(2),
don't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
is
an
obstruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
hasn’t
had
any
voluntary
or
careless?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
sinking
in
a
storm?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
almost
everything
that
section
10
talks
about
expressly
or
things
that
obviously
people
do
on
purpose
like
they
build
it
here
or
they
drop
something
in
a
river
and
things
like
that.
but
do
you
still
think
it
would
cover,
section
10
covers
a
negligent
or
innocent.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
that
triple
liability
lies
in
the
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would

the
