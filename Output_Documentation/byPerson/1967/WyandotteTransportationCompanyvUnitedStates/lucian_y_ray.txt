mr.
lucian
y.
ray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
two
cases
are
involved
here.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
district
court
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
motions
to
dismiss.
all
of
these
motions
filed
by
the
respondents
below
and
the
petitioners
here.
each
of
the
cases,
if
the
court
please,
involve
vessels
which
sank
in
the
mississippi
river
in
march
1961.
the
facts
is
to
each
of
accidents
are
not
complicated
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
briefly
review
them.
one
case
involves
the
barge
wycom
112
which
was
being
towed
up
the
mississippi
river
with
1000
tons
of
liquid
chlorine
and
when
the
tow
got
to
about
seven
miles
below
natchez,
mississippi
that
vessel
sank.
the
vessel
owner
attempted
to
locate
the
barge
was
unsuccessful
in
doing
so,
tendered
abandonment
to
the
core
of
engineers,
that
abandonment
was
at
first
rejected
and
then
later
on
the
court
through
the
district
engineer
at
vicksburg,
colonel
edward
accepted
the
abandonment
and
advised
the
wyandotte
that
the
barge
would
be
removed
under
the
provisions
of
section
19
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
if
the
court
is
interested
in
the
full
letter,
it
appears
on
pages
42
and
43
of
the
record.
after
the
abandonment
had
been
accepted,
the
core
of
engineers
together
with
other
agencies
of
the
government,
raised
the
barge
without
a
loss
of
any
of
the
chlorine,
the
chlorine
was
taken
back
to
gainesville,
louisiana
where
it
was
pumped
into
tanks.
the
government
filed
a
liable
against
the
three
petitioners
in
that
case
seeking
the
recovery
of
a
little
over
$3
million
for
the
cost
of
removal.
now,
the
other
case
involves
two
barges,
the
l1
and
m65
which
where
the
cargill,
a
barge
fleet
at
jackson's
landing
which
is
in
baton
rouge.
now
two
of
those
barges
left
the
landing
and
were
later
found
to
be
sunk
and
the
owners
marked
those
barges
for
a
while
and
then
tendered
an
abandonment
to
the
core
of
engineers.
the
abandonment
was
rejected
and
the
united
states
government,
the
department
of
justice
filed
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
asking
the
court
to
require
the
owners
of
those
barges
to
mark
them
and
also
to
declare
that
they
must
be
removed.
now,
those
barges
remained
un-removed.
the
barge
in
the
wycom
case,
it's
back
was
broken
when
it
went
down
and
but
the
tanks
and
the
chlorine
were
as
i've
said
delivered
back.
they
were
subsequently
sold
pursuant
to
the
request
of
the
government
and
the
$80,000
that
was
derived
from
their
sale
has
been
covered
into
the
registry
of
the
court
to
await
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
now,
the
district
court
rendered
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
both
actions
and
stated
that
the
only
right
that
the
government
had
to
recover
removal
expenses
was
against
the
cargo
was
against
the
vessels
themselves
and
the
cargo
and
there
was
no
in
personam
right.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
that
a
vessel
negligently
sunk
in
a
navigable
channel
and
i
might
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
negligent
issue
comes
into
this
case
as
the
court
can
appreciate
because
it
was
decided
on
the
pleadings.
we
don't
admit
for
one
minute
that
negligence
exists
and
in
fact
the
court
below
has,
in
its
judgment,
has
centered
back
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
both
the
question
of
causation
and
the
question
of
negligence.
but
the
court
said
that
a
sunken
vessel
did
constitute
an
obstruction
within
the
provisions
of
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
and
that
the
removal
of
the
vessels
could
be
compelled
by
the
injunctive
process
that
is
granted
by
section
12
of
that
statute
and
then
they
shifted
over
--
then
that
court
below
shifted
over
and
said
that
because
the
injunctive
process
exists
you
have
the
alternative
right
to
recover
the
expenses
of
removal.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
to
require
and
to
remove
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
you're
right,
you're
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
concede
that
and
we
conceded
in
this
--
conceded
here.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right
your
honor,
but
as
i
say
it's
being
physically
kept
there
until
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
absolutely
in
fact
that
--
it
reinforces
the
district
court's
opinion
and
it
reinforces
our
position
here
that
that
is
the
only
remedy
that
the
government
has.
now,
there
are
two
questions,
two
major
questions
if
the
court
please,
which
is
involved
here,
one
is
the
overall
question.
whether
a
vessel
owner
or
other
party
who
by
negligence
causes
a
vessel
to
sink
and
become
an
obstruction
to
navigation
is
liable
in
personam
to
the
united
states
for
the
expenses
of
removing
the
obstruction.
now,
the
second
and
it's
to
some
extent
subsidiary,
but
it's
still
a
major
question,
is
whether
a
sunken
vessel
constitutes
an
obstruction
to
navigation
under
section
10,
the
removal
of
which
can
be
enforced
by
injunction
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
12
of
the
same
statute.
now
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
pray
your
honor
that
that
abandonment
is
not
a
condition
precedent.
in
other
words,
as
i'll
develop
further
on,
in
the
argument
when
we
consider
the
sections
15,
19
and
20
in
certain
situations
abandonment
is
assumed,
in
other
words,
the
failure
to
take
any
action
creates
abandonment,
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
but
we
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
the
section
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
what
you
see
but
we
want
to
be
certain
mr.
justice
fortas
and
they're
used
interchangeably
in
the
decisions
and
the
statute.
we
have
tried
not
to
use
them
interchangeably
in
our
briefs
but
you
have
the
sections
of
the
act,
and
when
he
was
talking
about
section
19
of
the
act,
he
was
talking
about
33
u.s.c.a
440.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that
is
section
19.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
in
which
title
is
given
to
the
government,
what
is
removed
and
of
course
that's
what
happened,
that's
just
what
happened
in
this
situation.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
rejected
the
abandonment
and
what
they
are
trying
to
do
because
those
barges
are
still
there,
they
have
nothing
to
get
the
court
to
force
the
owner
to
remove
it,
remove
them
and
if
they
don't
and
the
government
has
to
do
it
they
will
pay
the
cost
of
removal.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
our
position
and
apparently
it
was
the
position
of
both
courts
below
because
the
district
court
as
i
have
stated
consolidated
them
and
granted
the
motions
to
dismiss
which
were
filed
by
the
respondents
in
both
cases
and
so
they,
the
cases
have
come
up
together
and
are
before
this
court
together.
now
we
think
this
is
a
most
unique
situation,
if
the
court
please.
this
statute
--
the
statute
of
1899,
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
has
been
in
existence
for
68
years.
back
in
1923
the
united
states
government
and
principally
the
department
of
justice,
but
the
moving
body
in
the
attempt
to
recover
the
expenses
of
removal
was
of
course
the
core
of
engineers.
back
in
1923
they
began
to
attempt
to
recover
in
personam
against
vessel
owners
for
removal
expenses.
way
back
in
the
laud
case
versus
united
states
in
the
sixth
circuit
after
43
years
they
have
attempted
unsuccessfully
until
this
decision
below
to
have
a
court
declare
that
a
sunken
vessel
was
an
obstruction
of
--
to
navigation
within
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
this
is
the
only
decision
on
the
books
and
i
say
this,
i
appreciate
this
as
this
court
does
that
there
isn't
any
--
that
numbers
alone
do
not
establish
the
soundness
of
a
doctrine
but
if
a
decision
stands
alone
when
you
have
11
cases
and
they
are
in
the
second
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
and
i'll
mention
three
cases
right
now
that
this
court
is
very
familiar
with,
involving
this
situation.
one
is
the
texmar
decision
that,
where
certiorari
was
applied
for
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
where
certiorari
was
denied.
there
is
the
marine
towing
company
case
that's
as
recent,
half
--
six
months
ago
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
declined
to
follow
the
decision
below
and
in
which
certiorari
application,
for
which
certiorari
is
now
pending
in
this
court
and
then
there
the
zubik
case
in
the
third
circuit.
now
all
three
of
those
decisions
and
then
the
decisions,
other
decisions,
in
other
words
the
11
decisions
in
there
entirely
have
declined
to
follow
a
decision
of
this
court
below.
now
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
that
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
that
where
you
have
a
uniform
construction
of
a
statute
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
construction
should
not
be
upset
rightly
and
i
simply
want
to
read
because
it's
very
short.
what
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
versus
ryan
case
in
that
connection,
it
said
“we
should
have
the
state
to
set
aside
at
this
late
date
the
uniform
construction
given
to
the
section
with
respect
to
this
question
by
the
lower
courts
for
more
than
60
years.”
now
we
don't
have
quite
60
years
in
this
case,
but
we
have
43
years
and
we
say
that,
we
say
that
if
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
comes
along
and
has
the
only
decision
that
goes
down
this
particular
path
that
it
simply
can't
be
right
in
all
the
rest
of
these
federal
courts
and
three
--
and
the
federal
courts
and
in
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
four
other
circuits
are
wrong.
now,
if
the
court
please
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
nor
in
the
provisions
of
section
10
on
that
act
which
makes
it
applicable
to
negligently
sunken
vessels.
you
can
look
whether
--
you
can
look
with
absolute,
you
can
scan
every
word
in
section
10
and
you
will
not
find
a
single
reference
to
a
vessel
sunken
or
otherwise.
now
i
ask
this
court
to
bear
with
me
for
just
a
minute
to
view
the
historic
background
that
will
demonstrate
i
think,
that
congress
has
since
its
inception
been
concerned
about
sunken
vessels
as
separate
entity
as
entities
that
are
separate
from
piers
and
break
waters
and
from
the
depositing
of
industrial
wastes
which
mr.
justice
douglas
brought
about
in
the
republic
steel
case.
now
as
long
ago
as
1824
congress
enacted
the
first
legislation
having
to
do
with
the
improvement
of
navigation
and
it
had
to
do
in
general
terms
with
improving
the
navigation
of
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers.
then
between
1824
and
1880
where
you
had
sunken
vessels,
they
had
to
go
to
congress
and
get
individual
private
acts,
they
were
separate
acts
that
had
to
do
with
the
removal
of
those
individual
wrecks.
then
you
come
up
to
1890,
no
in
1880
they
had
their
first,
they
had
their
first
legislation
where
they
had
a
continuing
appropriation
to
take
care
of
the
removal
of
wrecks.
and
then
they
got
in
1890,
they
added
a
provision
which
set
forth
the
wrecks
not
raised
within
two
months
become
derelicts
and
the
united
states
could
declare
them
an
obstruction
and
they
could
be
removed
without
any
liability
to
the
owner.
now
all
of
this,
if
the
court
please,
was
background
for
what
this
court
has
described
as
legislation
envisioning
a
grand
design
covering
the
navigation
--
the
navigability
of
rivers
and
the
removal
of
obstructions
and
that's
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
now
there
are
three
sections
in
that
rivers
and
harbors
act,
15,
19
and
20.
they
all
relate
to
vessels,
all
relate
to
vessels,
all
of
them
specify,
all
of
them
specify
what
shall
be
done
in
different
situations.
now
for
example,
for
example
section
15
provides
that
the,
there
shall
be
that
the
vessel
owner
when
a
vessel
sinks
must
mark
the
vessel,
that
the
failure
to
do
so
is
to
be
considered
an
abandonment
and
subject
the
vessel
to
removal.
section
19
provides
that
if
nothing
has
been
done
by
the
vessel
owner
in
30
days
or
if
he
abandons
prior
to
30
days
then
the
core
of
engineers
can
remove
and
what
they
do
from
a
practical
standpoint
as
this
court
knows
is
they,
is
they
enter
into
a
contract
for
the
removal
and
then
they
sell
the
wreck
and
the
money
that
they
get
is
deposited
into
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
now
section
20
involves
emergency
situations.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
feel
that
it
is
if
the
court
please.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
it's
certainly
is
a
key
or
governing
situation
in
as
far
as
the
two
sunken
barges
whereas
the
government
is
seeking
an
injunction--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
now
as
the
colonel
edward
indicated
you
see,
he
had
a
different
situation
in
wycom
because
this
had
gone
on
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
and
so
they
concluded
to
proceed
under
section
19
which
provides
that
if
after
30
days
nothing
has
been
done,
it's
declared
abandoned
and
then
the
go
ahead
and
remove
it
and
that's
what
they
did.
now
we
say
under
both
those
sections
that
there
is
no
in
personam
right
first
of
all
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
owners
of
the
barges
or
the
recovery
expenses
and
in
the
wycom
case
to
recover
expenses.
now
we
say
this
if
the
court
please,
if
i
think,
i
hope
i
demonstrated
that
for
more
than
a
100
years
congress
had
considered
sunken
vessels
as
separate
entities
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
these
three
sections
that
i
am
talking,
that
i
have
talked
about
are
called
wreck
statutes,
in
other
words
they
apply
to
sunken
vessel.
now
if
the
court
below
were
correct
in
saying
that
a
sunken
vessel
is
an
obstruction
within
section
10,
first
of
all
i
don't
have
to
suggest
to
this
court
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
congress
to
have
included
vessels
when
they
were
talking
about
in
section
10,
such
things
as
break
waters
and
the
depositing
of
waste.
now
the
court
did
not
do
that
because
it
had
these
other
three
sections,
this
part
applies,
specifically
the
sunken
vessel.
and
it
seems
to
me
and
to
us
that
the
court
will
have
to
conclude,
this
court
will
have
to
conclude
that
if
the
wreck
statute,
i
mean
if
section
10
contemplates
vessels
as
the
court
below
said,
then
the
wreck
statute
is
100%
redundant,
there
wouldn't
be
any
reason
for
it.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
mr.
justice
white
i
can
see
that
--
i
can
see
that
it,
well
in
fact
what
you
are
now
saying
is
what
we
are
saying
is
what
it
does.
in
other
words,
it
specifies
the
thing.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
section
10.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well
that's
right,
but
it
certainly
does
speak
of
them
as
obstructions
under
section
10
and
of
course
the
thing
that
this
court
has
got
to
determine
is
whether
a
sunken
vessel
is
an
obstruction
under
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
no
i
think
it
indicates
exactly
the
opposite.
in
another
words,
it
has
provided,
it
has
provided
an
exclusive
remedy.
in
other
words
we
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
what
i
am
saying
[attempt
to
laughter]
is,
that
it's
exclusive
remedy
mr.
justice
white.
in
another
words
i
say
this,
that
one
of
the
drafters
of
the
1899
act
were
considering
the
remedies,
they
had
various
remedies
to
consider.
now
we
say
what
they
chose
out
of
all
these
remedies
was
the
in
another
words
they
could
have
provided
with
simplicity,
the
right
to
recover
in
personam.
now
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
they
didn't
do
that
and
we
say
that
having
checked
these
various
alternatives
and
written
into
the
statute
that
if
a
vessel
has
been
sunken
and
is
removed
by
the
united
states
and
then
sold,
that
is
the
remedy.
in
another
words,
an
action
in
rem,
a
remedy
in
rem
is
the
only
remedy
that
exists
and
in
another
words
it
negates.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
i
say
this
that
if
the
that's
right
i
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
say
that
well
there
isn't
any
specific,
and
15
doesn't
give
any
injunctive
relief.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
but
if
he
doesn't
then
the
government
has
to
do
it.
in
another
words
i
think
this,
all
of
these
cases
we
think
is,
all
of
these
cases
we've
told
this
court
about
have
said
that
the
removal
of
obstructions
by
the,
as
a
public
function.
in
another
words,
that
is
how
the
statute
has
been
written
and
i
say
this
to
the
court.
i
feel
certain,
now
i
can't
base
this
upon
anything
except
my
own
personal
knowledge
in
connection
with
this
type
of
work,
but
i
say
this
to
the
court
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
where
sunken
vessels
are
removed,
the
sale
of
the
wreck
and
the
cargo
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
picks
up
the
tab,
in
other
words
there
isn't
drain
on
the
public
treasury.
now
in
this
situation
where
they
are
attempting
to
recover
$3
million
of
course
the
value,
that
doesn't
apply.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
here
is
--
this
was
the
situation
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
this
developed
the
core
of
engineers
and
the
other
branches
of
the
government
brought
about
the
sending
of
2000
national
guardsmen
from
oxford
mississippi
to
natchez.
they
send
in
30,000
gas
masks,
they
got
ready
to
evacuate
the
entire
population
of
natchez,
mississippi
and
they
did
actually
begin
the
evacuation
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
hospital.
now
the
liable
of
the
united
states
says
that
$1,500,000
for
the
expenses
i
have
just
described
and
$1,500,000
for
the
actual
expense
of
removal,
actual
getting
of
the
marine
equipment
in
there
to
get
the
sunken
tanks
with
chlorine
up
as
i
say
not
a
drop
was
spilled
and
they
got
it
back
with
safety
to
everybody.
now
i
don't
want
to
leave
my
argument
without
brining
to
the
attention
to
the
court,
the
court
is
aware
that
a
brief
amicus
curiae
has
been
filed
and
i
want
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
if
the
decision
below
if
affirmed
it
will
have
a
mark
and
in
some
instances
a
devastating
impact
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
for
the
past
60
years
while
the,
well
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
for
the
past
60
years
the
insurance
has
been
in
existence
--
has
not
taken
into
consideration
the
removal
expenses
because
none
have
inflected.
if
this
court
affirms,
the
insurance
premiums
will
go
out
of
sight
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
small
vessel
operators
may
have
to
go
out
of
business.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
united
kingdom
pardon
me.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
united
kingdom
has
a
statute,
has
a
statute
specifying
that
the
expenses
of
removal
are
recoverable
in
personam.
canada
has
the
same
thing.
there
are
six
bills
now
pending
in
congress
for
that
and
we
say
that's
where
the
department
should
go
to
gets
its
relief
and
not
to
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
two
cases
are
involved
here.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
district
court
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
motions
to
dismiss.
all
of
these
motions
filed
by
the
respondents
below
and
the
petitioners
here.
each
of
the
cases,
if
the
court
please,
involve
vessels
which
sank
in
the
mississippi
river
in
march
1961.
the
facts
is
to
each
of
accidents
are
not
complicated
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
briefly
review
them.
one
case
involves
the
barge
wycom
112
which
was
being
towed
up
the
mississippi
river
with
1000
tons
of
liquid
chlorine
and
when
the
tow
got
to
about
seven
miles
below
natchez,
mississippi
that
vessel
sank.
the
vessel
owner
attempted
to
locate
the
barge
was
unsuccessful
in
doing
so,
tendered
abandonment
to
the
core
of
engineers,
that
abandonment
was
at
first
rejected
and
then
later
on
the
court
through
the
district
engineer
at
vicksburg,
colonel
edward
accepted
the
abandonment
and
advised
the
wyandotte
that
the
barge
would
be
removed
under
the
provisions
of
section
19
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
if
the
court
is
interested
in
the
full
letter,
it
appears
on
pages
42
and
43
of
the
record.
after
the
abandonment
had
been
accepted,
the
core
of
engineers
together
with
other
agencies
of
the
government,
raised
the
barge
without
a
loss
of
any
of
the
chlorine,
the
chlorine
was
taken
back
to
gainesville,
louisiana
where
it
was
pumped
into
tanks.
the
government
filed
a
liable
against
the
three
petitioners
in
that
case
seeking
the
recovery
of
a
little
over
$3
million
for
the
cost
of
removal.
now,
the
other
case
involves
two
barges,
the
l1
and
m65
which
where
the
cargill,
a
barge
fleet
at
jackson's
landing
which
is
in
baton
rouge.
now
two
of
those
barges
left
the
landing
and
were
later
found
to
be
sunk
and
the
owners
marked
those
barges
for
a
while
and
then
tendered
an
abandonment
to
the
core
of
engineers.
the
abandonment
was
rejected
and
the
united
states
government,
the
department
of
justice
filed
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
asking
the
court
to
require
the
owners
of
those
barges
to
mark
them
and
also
to
declare
that
they
must
be
removed.
now,
those
barges
remained
un-removed.
the
barge
in
the
wycom
case,
it's
back
was
broken
when
it
went
down
and
but
the
tanks
and
the
chlorine
were
as
i've
said
delivered
back.
they
were
subsequently
sold
pursuant
to
the
request
of
the
government
and
the
$80,000
that
was
derived
from
their
sale
has
been
covered
into
the
registry
of
the
court
to
await
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
now,
the
district
court
rendered
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
both
actions
and
stated
that
the
only
right
that
the
government
had
to
recover
removal
expenses
was
against
the
cargo
was
against
the
vessels
themselves
and
the
cargo
and
there
was
no
in
personam
right.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
that
a
vessel
negligently
sunk
in
a
navigable
channel
and
i
might
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
negligent
issue
comes
into
this
case
as
the
court
can
appreciate
because
it
was
decided
on
the
pleadings.
we
don't
admit
for
one
minute
that
negligence
exists
and
in
fact
the
court
below
has,
in
its
judgment,
has
centered
back
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
both
the
question
of
causation
and
the
question
of
negligence.
but
the
court
said
that
a
sunken
vessel
did
constitute
an
obstruction
within
the
provisions
of
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
and
that
the
removal
of
the
vessels
could
be
compelled
by
the
injunctive
process
that
is
granted
by
section
12
of
that
statute
and
then
they
shifted
over
--
then
that
court
below
shifted
over
and
said
that
because
the
injunctive
process
exists
you
have
the
alternative
right
to
recover
the
expenses
of
removal.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
to
require
and
to
remove
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
you're
right,
you're
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
concede
that
and
we
conceded
in
this
--
conceded
here.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right
your
honor,
but
as
i
say
it's
being
physically
kept
there
until
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
absolutely
in
fact
that
--
it
reinforces
the
district
court's
opinion
and
it
reinforces
our
position
here
that
that
is
the
only
remedy
that
the
government
has.
now,
there
are
two
questions,
two
major
questions
if
the
court
please,
which
is
involved
here,
one
is
the
overall
question.
whether
a
vessel
owner
or
other
party
who
by
negligence
causes
a
vessel
to
sink
and
become
an
obstruction
to
navigation
is
liable
in
personam
to
the
united
states
for
the
expenses
of
removing
the
obstruction.
now,
the
second
and
it's
to
some
extent
subsidiary,
but
it's
still
a
major
question,
is
whether
a
sunken
vessel
constitutes
an
obstruction
to
navigation
under
section
10,
the
removal
of
which
can
be
enforced
by
injunction
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
12
of
the
same
statute.
now
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
pray
your
honor
that
that
abandonment
is
not
a
condition
precedent.
in
other
words,
as
i'll
develop
further
on,
in
the
argument
when
we
consider
the
sections
15,
19
and
20
in
certain
situations
abandonment
is
assumed,
in
other
words,
the
failure
to
take
any
action
creates
abandonment,
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
but
we
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
the
section
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
what
you
see
but
we
want
to
be
certain
mr.
justice
fortas
and
they're
used
interchangeably
in
the
decisions
and
the
statute.
we
have
tried
not
to
use
them
interchangeably
in
our
briefs
but
you
have
the
sections
of
the
act,
and
when
he
was
talking
about
section
19
of
the
act,
he
was
talking
about
33
u.s.c.a
440.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that
is
section
19.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
in
which
title
is
given
to
the
government,
what
is
removed
and
of
course
that's
what
happened,
that's
just
what
happened
in
this
situation.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
rejected
the
abandonment
and
what
they
are
trying
to
do
because
those
barges
are
still
there,
they
have
nothing
to
get
the
court
to
force
the
owner
to
remove
it,
remove
them
and
if
they
don't
and
the
government
has
to
do
it
they
will
pay
the
cost
of
removal.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
our
position
and
apparently
it
was
the
position
of
both
courts
below
because
the
district
court
as
i
have
stated
consolidated
them
and
granted
the
motions
to
dismiss
which
were
filed
by
the
respondents
in
both
cases
and
so
they,
the
cases
have
come
up
together
and
are
before
this
court
together.
now
we
think
this
is
a
most
unique
situation,
if
the
court
please.
this
statute
--
the
statute
of
1899,
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
has
been
in
existence
for
68
years.
back
in
1923
the
united
states
government
and
principally
the
department
of
justice,
but
the
moving
body
in
the
attempt
to
recover
the
expenses
of
removal
was
of
course
the
core
of
engineers.
back
in
1923
they
began
to
attempt
to
recover
in
personam
against
vessel
owners
for
removal
expenses.
way
back
in
the
laud
case
versus
united
states
in
the
sixth
circuit
after
43
years
they
have
attempted
unsuccessfully
until
this
decision
below
to
have
a
court
declare
that
a
sunken
vessel
was
an
obstruction
of
--
to
navigation
within
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
this
is
the
only
decision
on
the
books
and
i
say
this,
i
appreciate
this
as
this
court
does
that
there
isn't
any
--
that
numbers
alone
do
not
establish
the
soundness
of
a
doctrine
but
if
a
decision
stands
alone
when
you
have
11
cases
and
they
are
in
the
second
circuit,
the
third
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
and
i'll
mention
three
cases
right
now
that
this
court
is
very
familiar
with,
involving
this
situation.
one
is
the
texmar
decision
that,
where
certiorari
was
applied
for
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
where
certiorari
was
denied.
there
is
the
marine
towing
company
case
that's
as
recent,
half
--
six
months
ago
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
declined
to
follow
the
decision
below
and
in
which
certiorari
application,
for
which
certiorari
is
now
pending
in
this
court
and
then
there
the
zubik
case
in
the
third
circuit.
now
all
three
of
those
decisions
and
then
the
decisions,
other
decisions,
in
other
words
the
11
decisions
in
there
entirely
have
declined
to
follow
a
decision
of
this
court
below.
now
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
that
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
that
where
you
have
a
uniform
construction
of
a
statute
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
construction
should
not
be
upset
rightly
and
i
simply
want
to
read
because
it's
very
short.
what
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
versus
ryan
case
in
that
connection,
it
said
“we
should
have
the
state
to
set
aside
at
this
late
date
the
uniform
construction
given
to
the
section
with
respect
to
this
question
by
the
lower
courts
for
more
than
60
years.”
now
we
don't
have
quite
60
years
in
this
case,
but
we
have
43
years
and
we
say
that,
we
say
that
if
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
comes
along
and
has
the
only
decision
that
goes
down
this
particular
path
that
it
simply
can't
be
right
in
all
the
rest
of
these
federal
courts
and
three
--
and
the
federal
courts
and
in
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
four
other
circuits
are
wrong.
now,
if
the
court
please
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
nor
in
the
provisions
of
section
10
on
that
act
which
makes
it
applicable
to
negligently
sunken
vessels.
you
can
look
whether
--
you
can
look
with
absolute,
you
can
scan
every
word
in
section
10
and
you
will
not
find
a
single
reference
to
a
vessel
sunken
or
otherwise.
now
i
ask
this
court
to
bear
with
me
for
just
a
minute
to
view
the
historic
background
that
will
demonstrate
i
think,
that
congress
has
since
its
inception
been
concerned
about
sunken
vessels
as
separate
entity
as
entities
that
are
separate
from
piers
and
break
waters
and
from
the
depositing
of
industrial
wastes
which
mr.
justice
douglas
brought
about
in
the
republic
steel
case.
now
as
long
ago
as
1824
congress
enacted
the
first
legislation
having
to
do
with
the
improvement
of
navigation
and
it
had
to
do
in
general
terms
with
improving
the
navigation
of
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers.
then
between
1824
and
1880
where
you
had
sunken
vessels,
they
had
to
go
to
congress
and
get
individual
private
acts,
they
were
separate
acts
that
had
to
do
with
the
removal
of
those
individual
wrecks.
then
you
come
up
to
1890,
no
in
1880
they
had
their
first,
they
had
their
first
legislation
where
they
had
a
continuing
appropriation
to
take
care
of
the
removal
of
wrecks.
and
then
they
got
in
1890,
they
added
a
provision
which
set
forth
the
wrecks
not
raised
within
two
months
become
derelicts
and
the
united
states
could
declare
them
an
obstruction
and
they
could
be
removed
without
any
liability
to
the
owner.
now
all
of
this,
if
the
court
please,
was
background
for
what
this
court
has
described
as
legislation
envisioning
a
grand
design
covering
the
navigation
--
the
navigability
of
rivers
and
the
removal
of
obstructions
and
that's
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
now
there
are
three
sections
in
that
rivers
and
harbors
act,
15,
19
and
20.
they
all
relate
to
vessels,
all
relate
to
vessels,
all
of
them
specify,
all
of
them
specify
what
shall
be
done
in
different
situations.
now
for
example,
for
example
section
15
provides
that
the,
there
shall
be
that
the
vessel
owner
when
a
vessel
sinks
must
mark
the
vessel,
that
the
failure
to
do
so
is
to
be
considered
an
abandonment
and
subject
the
vessel
to
removal.
section
19
provides
that
if
nothing
has
been
done
by
the
vessel
owner
in
30
days
or
if
he
abandons
prior
to
30
days
then
the
core
of
engineers
can
remove
and
what
they
do
from
a
practical
standpoint
as
this
court
knows
is
they,
is
they
enter
into
a
contract
for
the
removal
and
then
they
sell
the
wreck
and
the
money
that
they
get
is
deposited
into
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
now
section
20
involves
emergency
situations.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
we
feel
that
it
is
if
the
court
please.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
it's
certainly
is
a
key
or
governing
situation
in
as
far
as
the
two
sunken
barges
whereas
the
government
is
seeking
an
injunction--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
now
as
the
colonel
edward
indicated
you
see,
he
had
a
different
situation
in
wycom
because
this
had
gone
on
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
and
so
they
concluded
to
proceed
under
section
19
which
provides
that
if
after
30
days
nothing
has
been
done,
it's
declared
abandoned
and
then
the
go
ahead
and
remove
it
and
that's
what
they
did.
now
we
say
under
both
those
sections
that
there
is
no
in
personam
right
first
of
all
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
owners
of
the
barges
or
the
recovery
expenses
and
in
the
wycom
case
to
recover
expenses.
now
we
say
this
if
the
court
please,
if
i
think,
i
hope
i
demonstrated
that
for
more
than
a
100
years
congress
had
considered
sunken
vessels
as
separate
entities
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
these
three
sections
that
i
am
talking,
that
i
have
talked
about
are
called
wreck
statutes,
in
other
words
they
apply
to
sunken
vessel.
now
if
the
court
below
were
correct
in
saying
that
a
sunken
vessel
is
an
obstruction
within
section
10,
first
of
all
i
don't
have
to
suggest
to
this
court
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
congress
to
have
included
vessels
when
they
were
talking
about
in
section
10,
such
things
as
break
waters
and
the
depositing
of
waste.
now
the
court
did
not
do
that
because
it
had
these
other
three
sections,
this
part
applies,
specifically
the
sunken
vessel.
and
it
seems
to
me
and
to
us
that
the
court
will
have
to
conclude,
this
court
will
have
to
conclude
that
if
the
wreck
statute,
i
mean
if
section
10
contemplates
vessels
as
the
court
below
said,
then
the
wreck
statute
is
100%
redundant,
there
wouldn't
be
any
reason
for
it.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
mr.
justice
white
i
can
see
that
--
i
can
see
that
it,
well
in
fact
what
you
are
now
saying
is
what
we
are
saying
is
what
it
does.
in
other
words,
it
specifies
the
thing.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
section
10.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well
that's
right,
but
it
certainly
does
speak
of
them
as
obstructions
under
section
10
and
of
course
the
thing
that
this
court
has
got
to
determine
is
whether
a
sunken
vessel
is
an
obstruction
under
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
no
i
think
it
indicates
exactly
the
opposite.
in
another
words,
it
has
provided,
it
has
provided
an
exclusive
remedy.
in
other
words
we
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
what
i
am
saying
[attempt
to
laughter]
is,
that
it's
exclusive
remedy
mr.
justice
white.
in
another
words
i
say
this,
that
one
of
the
drafters
of
the
1899
act
were
considering
the
remedies,
they
had
various
remedies
to
consider.
now
we
say
what
they
chose
out
of
all
these
remedies
was
the
in
another
words
they
could
have
provided
with
simplicity,
the
right
to
recover
in
personam.
now
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
they
didn't
do
that
and
we
say
that
having
checked
these
various
alternatives
and
written
into
the
statute
that
if
a
vessel
has
been
sunken
and
is
removed
by
the
united
states
and
then
sold,
that
is
the
remedy.
in
another
words,
an
action
in
rem,
a
remedy
in
rem
is
the
only
remedy
that
exists
and
in
another
words
it
negates.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
i
say
this
that
if
the
that's
right
i
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
say
that
well
there
isn't
any
specific,
and
15
doesn't
give
any
injunctive
relief.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
but
if
he
doesn't
then
the
government
has
to
do
it.
in
another
words
i
think
this,
all
of
these
cases
we
think
is,
all
of
these
cases
we've
told
this
court
about
have
said
that
the
removal
of
obstructions
by
the,
as
a
public
function.
in
another
words,
that
is
how
the
statute
has
been
written
and
i
say
this
to
the
court.
i
feel
certain,
now
i
can't
base
this
upon
anything
except
my
own
personal
knowledge
in
connection
with
this
type
of
work,
but
i
say
this
to
the
court
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
where
sunken
vessels
are
removed,
the
sale
of
the
wreck
and
the
cargo
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
picks
up
the
tab,
in
other
words
there
isn't
drain
on
the
public
treasury.
now
in
this
situation
where
they
are
attempting
to
recover
$3
million
of
course
the
value,
that
doesn't
apply.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
here
is
--
this
was
the
situation
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
this
developed
the
core
of
engineers
and
the
other
branches
of
the
government
brought
about
the
sending
of
2000
national
guardsmen
from
oxford
mississippi
to
natchez.
they
send
in
30,000
gas
masks,
they
got
ready
to
evacuate
the
entire
population
of
natchez,
mississippi
and
they
did
actually
begin
the
evacuation
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
hospital.
now
the
liable
of
the
united
states
says
that
$1,500,000
for
the
expenses
i
have
just
described
and
$1,500,000
for
the
actual
expense
of
removal,
actual
getting
of
the
marine
equipment
in
there
to
get
the
sunken
tanks
with
chlorine
up
as
i
say
not
a
drop
was
spilled
and
they
got
it
back
with
safety
to
everybody.
now
i
don't
want
to
leave
my
argument
without
brining
to
the
attention
to
the
court,
the
court
is
aware
that
a
brief
amicus
curiae
has
been
filed
and
i
want
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
if
the
decision
below
if
affirmed
it
will
have
a
mark
and
in
some
instances
a
devastating
impact
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
for
the
past
60
years
while
the,
well
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
for
the
past
60
years
the
insurance
has
been
in
existence
--
has
not
taken
into
consideration
the
removal
expenses
because
none
have
inflected.
if
this
court
affirms,
the
insurance
premiums
will
go
out
of
sight
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
small
vessel
operators
may
have
to
go
out
of
business.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
united
kingdom
pardon
me.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
united
kingdom
has
a
statute,
has
a
statute
specifying
that
the
expenses
of
removal
are
recoverable
in
personam.
canada
has
the
same
thing.
there
are
six
bills
now
pending
in
congress
for
that
and
we
say
that's
where
the
department
should
go
to
gets
its
relief
and
not
to
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
