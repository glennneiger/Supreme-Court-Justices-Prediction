justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ray,
you
make
no
distinction
between
these
two
cases?
in
other
words,
you
think
that
these
two
cases
has
to
be
governed
by
the
same
principle?
justice
abe
fortas
despite
the
fact
that
in
one
case
the
abandonment
was
accepted
by
the
core
of
engineers
in
a
letter
saying
that
we'll
proceed
to
move
the
chlorine
barge
under
provisions
of
section
19
and
then
the
other
case
the
united
states
appears
to
accept
the
abandonment?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
two
questions,
one
is
abandonment
and
the
other
is
united
states
acceptance
of
the
abandonment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
united
states
notification
which
happened
in
the
case
of
the
rights
to
[inaudible]
united
states
notification
to
the
owner
that
the
united
states
is
proceeding
under
section
19,
am
i
correct
section
19
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
says
that
the
secretary
will
proceed
without
liability
or
damage
to
the
owners?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
that's
one
i
am
referring
to,
that
is
section
19.
justice
abe
fortas
yeah.
justice
abe
fortas
yeah
but
in
the
second
case,
cargill
case
there
was
no
such
statement
by
around
the
house
in
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
trying
to
get
your
position
and
i
take
it
now
that
your
position
is
those
differences
in
the
past
should
make
no
differences
in
the
legal
results?
justice
abe
fortas
well
before
you
leave
section
15
may
i
ask
you
this.
the
--
towards
the
end
of
that
section
it
says
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
owner,
said
something
prior
to
prosecute
the
removal
of
it
diligently,
right?
and
failure
to
do
so
shall
be
considered
an
abandonment
of
such
craft
and
subject
the
same
removal
by
the
united
states.
now
if
you
regard
the,
both
of
these
cases
as
coming
within
section
15,
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
any
specific
language
that
i
have
just
read
is
preclusive
of
other
remedies
to
the
united
states,
that
is
to
say
the
statute
does
say
that
it
should
be
the
duty
of
owner
to
commence
removal
immediately?
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
prosecute
the
removal
diligently
then
the
statute
says
that
if
you
then
do
so
that
will
be
considered
abandoned?
justice
abe
fortas
question
is
whether
that
is
preclusive
of
why
then
the
united
state
is
seeking
an
injunction
to
compel
the
owner
to
commence
immediate
removal
of
the
wreck
and
prosecute
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
is,
is
that
to
your
mind
a
key
or
governing
sections?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
rule
in
the
united
kingdom,
is
there
one?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
an
express
provision
for
injunction,
isn't
there?
in
section
12
there
is
an
expressed
provision
for
a
injunction,
which
relates
back
to
section
10
but
the
problem
there
is
it,
it
talks
in
terms
of
removal
of
any
structures
or
parts
of
structures
and
the
language
doesn't
seem
to
me
as
broad
as
language
of
section
10
which
says
that
creation
of
any
obstruction
is
prohibited.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
sort
of
what
the
statute
says
at
least
the
first
part
of
it
of
what
you
just
said.
let
us
say
that
if
a
owner
does
not
remove
the
wreck
then
failure
to
do
so
should
be
considered
as
an
abandonment
of
such
craft
and
subject
the
same
to
removal
by
the
united
states
and
what
you
have
to
argue,
i'm
taking
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
the
explicit
remedies,
a
fact
that
negligence
sinking
or
willful
sinking
of
the
ship
is
a
crime
and
punishable
as
statute
provides.
fact
that
sinking
and
abandonment
of
the
ship
enables
the
united
states
to
take
it
and
to
sell
it
and
sell
the
cargo
that
despite
the
specific
reference
to
those
remedies,
there
are
two
other
remedies
namely,
they
are
not
specified,
namely
injunction
and
in
personam
liability?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
an
official
statement
that
the
legislation
was
intended
to
be
only
clarifying?
does
it
appear
somewhere
in
legislation?
justice

abandonment
and
the

is
united

acceptance
of
