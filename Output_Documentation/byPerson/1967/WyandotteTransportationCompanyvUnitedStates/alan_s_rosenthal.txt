mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
republic
steel
case,
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
was
part
of
a
great
design
to
facilitate
unimpeded
flow
of
water
commerce
over
our
nation's
waterways
by
ensuring
the
existence
of
navigable
channels
free
from
obstructions.
now
the
question
in
this
case
reduced
to
a
simple
form,
is
whether
or
not
those
and
this
case
doesn't
involve
just
ship
owners
it
also
involves
others,
negligently
create
obstructions
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
in
violation
of
two,
not
one,
but
two
express
prohibitions
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
as
well
as
in
derogation
of
common
law
responsibilities
relating
to
the
maintenance
of
public
nuisances
and
who
having
violated
the
act
then
have
failed
to
comply
with
an
explicit
statutory
command
to
remove
the
obstruction
can
be
compelled
by
judicial
process
either
to
remove
it
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
wycom
112
where
the
government
was
required
to
affect
removal
and
be
required
to
reimburse
the
united
states
the
expense
incurred
by
the
public
treasury
in
affecting
the
people.
if
the
court
pleases
we
believe
starting
point
is
that
the
court
below
held
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
section
10
in
turn
prohibits
the
creation
of
any
not
just
some
but
any
obstruction
not
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
to
the
navigable
capacity
to
any
of
waters
in
the
united
states.
now
as
this
court
observed
in
republic
steel
case,
the
cause
of
holding
that
industrial
waste
constituted
the
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
term
obstruction
has
been
given
by
the
court,
a
very
broad
reading.
it
encompasses
that
this
court
said
many,
many
years
ago
in
the
rio
grande
irrigation
company,
anything
whatever
done
or
however
done
within
the
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
which
tends
to
destroy
the
navigable
capacity
of
one
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
argued
that
a
sunken
vessel
any
less
than
a
dam
or
industrial
wastes
constitutes
and
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
that
definition.
furthermore,
section
10
as
this
court
observed
in
public
steel
case
was
intended
to
codify
the
existing
law
and
making
1894,
five
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
1899
act
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
have
held
that
a
sunken
vessel
was
an
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
of
1890
act,
which
act
contained
similar
language
in
section
10,
section
10
of
1899
statute.
now
being
within
section
10,
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
here
are
under
the
doctrine
of
republic
steel
case
responsible
for
the
removal
of
the
vessel
or
for
the
removal
to
assume
the
costs
of
the
removal
by
the
united
states.
now
the
violation
of
section
10's
prohibition
has
made
it
crime
by
section
12
of
the
act
and
this
is
settled
rule
that
the
disregard
the
command
of
a
penal
statute
is
a
wrongful
act
for
which
the
courts
will
imply
a
right
to
recover
damages
from
the
attending
party.
this
a
rule
which
is
illustrated
by
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
texas
&
pacific
rail
road
versus
rigsby
and
j.i.
case
company
versus
borak
relatively
recent
decision,
377
united
states.
now
we
think
it
was
this
general
principal
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
determination
in
republic
steel
that
despite
the
absence
of
an
express
provision
for
injunctive
relief
that
section
10
carried
with
it
the
implicit
remedy
of
injunction
where
as
here
an
obstruction
to
navigable
waters
have
been
created.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
actually
in
the
republic
steel
case
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
the
united
states
was
not
entitled
to
an
injunction
under
section
10
where
the
obstruction
did
not
constitute
a
structure
and
the
court
had
relied
upon
the
fact
that
section
12
had
conferred
a
specific
right
with
respect
to
structures
and
therefore
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
congress
did
not
intend
injunctive
relief
to
available
where
the
obstruction
did
not
constitute
a
structure
and
this
court
reversed
that
determination
holding
that
the
section
10
taken
in
the
context
of
its
great
design
permitted
the
implication
of
those
remedies,
which
are
appropriate
to
the
carrying
out
of
that
design.
now
we
think
the
injunctive
remedy
is
plainly
within
the
scope
of
permissible
remedies,
indeed
republic
steel
still
holds
and
we
think
as
two
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
that
another
appropriate
remedy
where
necessary
as
this,
the
case
with
wycom
112
is
the
remedy
of
--
of
recovering
removal
costs.
there
is
certainly
no
reason
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
from
paving
why
the
offender
should
escape
his
due
merely
because
the
situation
is
such
the
government
feels
compelled
to
go
into
court
rather
to
remove
the
vessel
at
the
outset
rather
than
to
pursue
its
often
slow
injunctive
remedies.
now
even
if
court
pleases
section
10
did
not
embrace
the
obstruction
in
this
case.
it
is
conceded
as
we
understand
it
that
this
obstruction
created
by
negligence
was
a
violation
of
section
15,
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
voluntarily
or
carelessly
sink
or
permit
or
caused
to
be
sunk
vessels
or
other
crafts
in
navigable
channels.
now
despite
the
fact
section
15
goes
on
to
impose
an
affirmative
express
duty
upon
he
who
causes
an
obstruction,
indeed
causes
an
obstruction
even
innocently
to
remove
the
obstruction,
seek
to
immediately
remove
the
obstruction.
the
position
of
these
petitioners
is
that
they
do
not
need
to
comply
with
that
duty.
all
that
they
need
to
do
is
to
tell
the
core
of
engineers
that
even
though
this
obstruction
was
occasioned
negligently,
even
though
they
have
the
statutory
duty,
they
are
abandoning
the
vessel
and
at
that
point
the
consequences
of
their
negligence
falls
upon
the
united
states
and
upon
the
public
treasury.
now
we
submit
that
there
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
in
that
connection
this.
the
reason
for
the
provisions
in
section
15
and
again
in
section
19
with
respect
to
the
abandonment
of
vessels
was
not
the
immunization
of
negligent
ship
owners
and
others
from
liability
in
these
circumstances.
the
reason
that
these
provisions
were
inserted
and
i
might
say
that
they
apply
not
only
in
the
case
of
negligibly
sunk
vessels,
but
also
in
the
case
of
innocently
sunk
vessels
where
the
vessel
sinks
without
any
fault
upon
the
owner
was
to
provide
immunity
to
the
united
states
if
it
sought
to
remove
the
vessel
and
the
united
states
has
had
to
from
time
to
time
invoke
those
provisions
for
that
purpose.
an
example
of
that
is
the
first
zubik
case,
zubik
against
the
united
states
where
zubik
was
challenging
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
remove
and
to
retain
a
sunken
vessel.
and
as
the
court
observed
in
that
case
the
statute
conferred
upon
the
united
states
the
right
where
the
vessel
has
been
abandoned
by
the
owner,
this
is
irrespective
again
whether
the
owner
is
at
fault
or
not,
to
step
in,
if
it
feels
necessary
to
do
so
to
remove
the
vessel
and
it
is
given
then
the
right
to
disposal
of
the
vessel.
now
there
is
no
suggestion
at
all
that
in
those
provisions,
congress
was
intending
to
change
the
settled
rule
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
an
act
which
i
might
say
until
their
reply
brief
filed
at
least
received
by
us
just
today,
the
petitioners
entirely
ignored.
now
the
limitation
of
liability
act
enacted
in
1851
as
construed
consistently
by
this
court
restricts
the
right
of
the
owner,
ship
owner
to
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel
and
its
cargo
then
pending
that's
after
all
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
do
here
to
cases
in
which
the
loss
or
the
damage
was
without
the
owner's
perfidy
or
fault
or
knowledge
rather
and
that
has
been
construed
by
this
court
to
mean
without
the
owners
fault.
now
it's
utterly
inconceivable
to
us
if
the
court
pleases
that
in
1899
when
congress
was
enacting,
what
again
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
this
great
design
for
the
protection
of
our
navigable
waters,
the
congress
on
the
one
hand
imposed
these
affirmative
responsibilities
upon
the
ship
owner
and
on
the
other
hand
said
to
the
ship
owner
if
you
violate
them
then
your
rights
are
greater
--
are
greater
than
the
rights
which
you
had
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act
of
1851.
it
would
be
we
respectfully
submit
to
attribute
to
congress
a
completely
perverse
intent,
to
subscribe
to
the
view
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
that
congress
intended
that
those
who
negligibly
obstruct
our
waters
to
be
able
to
trust
upon
the
public
treasury,
the
responsibility
for
removing
those
obstructions.
now
if
the
court
pleases
i
think
that
some
just
passing
reference
should
be
made
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
this
rivers
and
harbors
act
as
well
as
most
them
contain
very
little
legislative
history
at
all.
there
is
essentially
what
i
think
are
colloquially
referred
to
pork
barrel
bills.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1899
act
does
indicate
however
that
it
was
not
intended
to
change
existing
law,
but
it
was
a
codification
of
existing
law
and
that
too
i
think
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
republic
steel.
now
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
1880,
the
relevant
provisions
of
1880,
1882
and
1890
acts
and
we
think
that
those
acts
taken
in
combination
certainly
bare
out
our
contention
that
when
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
these
specific
remedies
these
were
remedies
which
were
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states
against
a
suit
by
the
ship
owner
who
might
have
claim
that
his
vessel
has
innocently
sunk
and
if
the
united
states
had
had
no
right
to
remove
it
and
then
to
cart
it
off.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
our
statutory
remedy
that's
correct,
but
this,
we
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
harlan
that
on
that
the
remedy
is
to
be
applied
here
not
only
on
the
basis,
again
of
republic
steel
but
on
the
basis
of
the
principle
illustrated
again
by
the
rigsby
case
to
which
i
referred
before.
now
i
think
that
it
should
bear
a
mention
that
we
do
not
accept
the
petitioner's
position
that
it
has
been
held
11
times
over
a
period
of
40
years
that
these
rights
do
not
exist.
actually
in
the
context
of
a
negligent
ship
owner
the
question
has
come
up
really,
squarely
presented
in
three
cases.
those
were
texmar
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
which
decision
was
against
united
states
by
a
divided
vote
and
the
recent
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
also
was
against
united
states
there
too
by
divided
vote,
judge
browning
dissented
in
the
ninth
circuit,
judge
sobeloff
dissented
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
unanimous
decision
in
the
government's
favor
in
the
case
which
is
before
this
court
at
this
time
for
review.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i'm
saying
that
that
is
the
complete
history
in
terms
of
the
right
of
a
negligent
ship
owner
to
abandon
his
vessel
with
impunity.
now
the
only
other
court
case,
american
case
which
dealt
with
a
negligent
ship
owner
as
such
was
the
second
zubik
case.
in
the
second
zubik
case,
the
court
regarded
section
10
as
applying
to
sunken
vessels
but
it
took
the
position
that
only
in
rem
remedies
were
provided
by
the
act
and
that's
a
position
we
think
is
wrong.
but
it
in
terms
of
the
question
of
the
ship
owner's
right
to
abandon
it
is
just
these
three
cases
about
a
negligent
ship
owner.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
briefly
recapitulate,
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
the
negligence
sinking
of
a
vessel
which
creates
an
obstruction
to
navigation
violates
both
section
10
and
section
15
of
rivers
and
harbors
act.
and
under
this
court’s
decision
in
republic
steel
as
well
as
under
the
settled
principle
reflected
by
this
court’s
decision,
for
example
in
texas
pacific
railway
versus
rigsby,
there
is
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
these
petitioners
either
--
they
can
be
compelled
by
injunction
to
remove
the
vessel
or
the
unite
states
is
required
to
remove
it,
they
can
be
compelled
to
reimburse
the
government
for
removal
expenses.
and
third
that
the
petitioners
cannot
avoid
a
responsibility
by
relying
on
their
abandonment
of
the
vessel,
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
particularly
when
viewed
in
context
of
its
great
design
cannot
be
read
as
repealing
the
limitation
of
the
liability
act
of
1851,
which
act
as
construed
by
this
court
permits
a
ship
owner
to
limit
its
liability
to
the
value
of
its
vessel
and
the
cargo
only
in
circumstances
where
there
is
no
fault
attributable
to
the
ship
owner.
i
might
stress
in
that
connection
that
quite
apart
from
the
matter
of
limitation
of
liability
act
some
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
ship
owners
at
all.
they
were
not
the
owners
of
the
sunken
vessel
as
one,
at
least
one
petitioner
of
each
case
that
falls
into
that
classification
and
the
right
of
abandonment
even
if
it
existed
where
there
has
been
thought
would
not
be
of
any
benefit
to
them.
now
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
one
case
your
honor
the
petitioner
was
the
owner
of
the
boat
which
towed
the
wycam
112.
in
the
other
case
the
cargill,
petitioner
cargill
was
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
mooring
facility
at
which
the
two
barges
were
located
and
one
of
the
allegations
of
negligence
or
at
least
one
of
the
allegations
of
negligence
relates
to
negligent
mooring.
now
we
--
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
i
would
close
by
simply
pointing
out
again
that
as
judge
browning
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
texmar
case
where
he
considered
all
of
these
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
has
relied
that
none
of
them
are
in
point.
in
contrast
to
that
within
a
matter
of
two
years
after
the
passage
of
rivers
and
harbors
act
in
1899,
the
act
was
administratively
construed
by
the
secretary
of
war
as
requiring
in
cases
of
fault,
the
ship
owner
to
remove
the
vessel
and
that
administrative
interpretation
now
appears
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
is
quoted
in
the
government’s
brief.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
are
bills
your
honor,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
such
as
it
is
of
those
bills
to
suggest
that
the
sponsors
of
that
legislation
felt
that
the
existing
law
did
not
provide
the
remedies
which
the
government
urges
flow
from
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
the
reason
for
the
introduction
of
those
bills
was
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
texmar
case
three
or
four
years
ago
and
the
legislation
was
intended
to
be
a
clarification.
and
at
this
juncture
as
i
understand
it
with
the
question
now
before
this
court,
there
is
no
further
endeavor
being
made
with
respect
to
that
legislation.
we
don’t
think
that
the
pendency
of
that
legislation
in
recent
years
in
any
way
reflects
the
view
on
the
part
of
the
congress
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
itself
does
not,
by
implications
under
the
doctrine
of
republic
steel
and
texas
pacific
railway
against
rigsby
provide
the
remedy
which
we
urge
here.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
is
one
committee
report,
i
don’t
think
it
uses
the
word
clarification
as
such,
but
we
think
that
the,
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
the,
this
legislative
history.
we
think
that
the
thrust
of
it
certainly
is
that
the
congress,
at
least
the
sponsors
of
that
legislation
were
very
concerned
about
the
construction
which
had
been
given
the
act
in
the
texmar
case.
and
that
as
i
suggested
yesterday
actually
was
the
first
case
which
had
construed
the
act
as
being
totally
unavailable
in
the
case
of
negligent
ship
owners.
now
the
third
circuit
in
1961
in
united
states
versus
zubik
held
that
a
negligently
sunk
vessel
was
within
section
10
and
that
the
government
could
obtain
an
injunction
requiring
removal.
it's
true
that
the
third
circuit
in
that
case
went
on
the
hold
that,
where
the
government
had
removed
the
vessel
it
was
limited
to
in
rem
remedies,
but
the
texmar
was
the
first
case
which
suggested
that
the
--
a
ship
owner
who
violates
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
not
only
by
creating
an
obstruction
but
then
by
failing
to
fulfill
his
duty
to
remove
can
escape
any
responsibility
by
simply
abandoning
the
vessel.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor
in
most
of
the
earlier
cases
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
most
of
earlier
cases
your
honor
either
did
not
involve
abandonment
or
involve
an
innocent
sinking.
now
for
example
the
manhattan,
which
is
the
case
upon
which
the
petitioners
place
perhaps
the
greatest
reliance,
the
manhattan,
a
government
vessel
had
sunk
through
the
negligence
of
another
and
there
was
not
question
in
the
case.
the
court’s
determination
makes
abundantly
clear
that
the
sinking
was
of
the
government
vessel
insofar
as
the
owner,
the
government
was
concerned
was
entirely
without
fault
and
the
government
endeavored
to
obtain
from
the
tortfeasor,
the
cost
incurred
by
the
government
in
removing
its
own
vessel
and
the
court
said
that
since
the
government
had
not
been
responsible
for
removing
it
since
it
had
the
right
of
abandonment,
therefore
it
could
not
recover
this
cost
since
it
had
no
responsibility
to
remove
in
the
first
instance.
now
not
only
was
the
manhattan
a
sinking,
an
innocent
sinking
insofar
as
the
ship
owner
was
concerned,
but
in
addition
the
manhattan
relied
upon
english
cases
which
as
we
note
in
our
brief
make
it
clear
that
the
right
of
abandonment
is
dependent
upon
the
sinking
being
an
innocent
one.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
united
kingdom
your
honor
has
a
different
statute
that
is
quite
true.
they
also
in
united
kingdom
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct,
that’s
right.
the
english
have
a
different
statute
but
the
english
also
i
might
–
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
if
your
honor
pleases
is
true
although
we
contend
that
united
states
has
a
definite
proprietary
interest
in
the
waters
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
untied
states
and
that
relates
the
our
alternative
contention
which
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below
and
that
is
that
in
addition
to
violating
their
statutory
obligations
the
petitioners
violated
their
long
standing
non-statutory
obligations
recognized
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
the
12
peters
in
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
georgetown
against
the
alexandria
canal
company.
this
is
an
obligation
not
to
create
an
obstruction
in
a
public
or
on
a
public
highway
and
as
this
court
observed
in
the
georgetown
case,
they
involved
the
potomac
river,
navigable
waters
are
public
highways
for
the
purposes
of
the
docking
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
individual
who
creates
a
public
nuisance
in
a
navigable
water
can
be
required
to
remove
that
nuisance.
we
require
through
the
injunctive
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor
it
was
based
upon
a
non-statutory
obligation.
now
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
united
states
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
first
it
has
a
regulatory
interest
stemming
from
its
constitutional
power
to
regulate
commerce
over
our
waterways
and
second
it
has
a
proprietary
interest
not
only
because
it
is
the
guardian
of
the
waters
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
own
those
waters
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
also
because
the
united
states
is
consistently
making
improvements
in
the
navigable
waters.
the
mississippi
in
particular
and
this
we
believe
is
sufficient
under
the
principles
of
such
cases
as
san
jacinto
tin
and
cotton
against
united
states
and
in
re
debts
for
the
united
states
without,
even
with
a
statute
to
assert
the
right
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
this
we
suggest
is
a
recognized
liability.
now
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
point
that
was
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
brief
and
was
reiterated
yesterday
by
mr.
ray
and
that
is
that
the
effect
of
an
affirmance
in
this
case
would
be
to
bankrupt
many
water
carriers
and
we
think
that
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
suggestion
at
all.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
as
this
appears
in
this
record
in
this
case,
the
standard
protection
and
indemnity
insurance
form
covers
this
kind
of
liability.
now
in
the
case
of
substantial
barges
which
are
carrying
chlorine
gas,
the
premiums
needless
to
say
maybe
high,
but
so
i
would
suppose
the
premiums
are
quite
high
on
commercial
airlines.
in
the
case
of
small
fishing
vessels
where
the
risk
is
much
less
where
the
cost
of
removal
would
be
much
smaller
presumably
the
premiums
would
be
much
lower.
but
we
find
it
quite
startling
quite
frankly
that
it
is
contended
that
this
court
should
hold
that
negligent
ship
owners
should
be
insulated
from
the
consequences
of
their
negligence
simply
because
if
they
are
saddled
with
the
consequences
of
that
negligence
it
may
occasion
financial
damage.
i
mean
this
is
a
consequence
which
anyone
in
any
business
must
undertake
and
again
insurance
is
very
definitely
available
in
this
area.
so
for
these
reasons
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
either
both
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
an
implicit
right
conferred
by
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
recover
the
cost
of
removal
or
to
obtain
an
injunction
to
require
a
mobile
or
on
the
ground
that
there
is
a
long
established
common
law
obligation
on
the
part
of
ship
owners
who
create
public
nuisances
in
the
nation's
waterways
which
obligation
can
be
enforced
by
the
united
states.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
your
honor
is
–
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
10
and
15
criminal
liability
would
exist.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
would
be
required--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor
it,
we’ll
i’d
know
actually
i
think
it
maybe
the
--
in
terms
of
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
in
section
15
that
probation
is
tied
in
terms
to
a
voluntary
or
careless
sinking.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
or
careless,
now
by
voluntary
we
take
it
to
mean
intention,
so
that
for
the
purposes
of
section,
of
that
probation
in
section
15
there
would
have
to
be
either
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
your
honor
what
would
i
suppose
be
involved
there
is
would
be
the
question
if
the
issue
arose
to
whether
section
10
applies
to
an
innocent
creation
of
a
obstruction
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
whether
the
term
create
would,
which
is
used
in
section
10
would
keep
out
of
the
ambit
of
section
10
innocent
sinking,
it’s
not
what,
it
might
be
argued
that
one
who
creates,
one
whose
vessel
sinks
without
any
fault
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
owner
has
not
created
an
obstruction
that
the
term
creation
would
carry
with
it
the
implication
it
of
being
either
some,
of
intentional
act
or
some
miss
or
malfeasance.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
--
well
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
your
honor
we
are
not
arguing
that
it
covers
innocent
sinking.
we
say
it
very
definitely
it
does
cover
negligent
sinking.
we
say
beyond
question,
he
who
threw
his
negligence
creates
an
obstruction
in
the
form
of
a
sunken
vessel
and
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here
in
the
allegation
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right
although
i
would
say
that
it’s
very
unlikely
in
the
case
of
innocent
sinking
that
criminal
liability
would
be
sought.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
republic
steel
case,
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
was
part
of
a
great
design
to
facilitate
unimpeded
flow
of
water
commerce
over
our
nation's
waterways
by
ensuring
the
existence
of
navigable
channels
free
from
obstructions.
now
the
question
in
this
case
reduced
to
a
simple
form,
is
whether
or
not
those
and
this
case
doesn't
involve
just
ship
owners
it
also
involves
others,
negligently
create
obstructions
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
in
violation
of
two,
not
one,
but
two
express
prohibitions
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
as
well
as
in
derogation
of
common
law
responsibilities
relating
to
the
maintenance
of
public
nuisances
and
who
having
violated
the
act
then
have
failed
to
comply
with
an
explicit
statutory
command
to
remove
the
obstruction
can
be
compelled
by
judicial
process
either
to
remove
it
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
wycom
112
where
the
government
was
required
to
affect
removal
and
be
required
to
reimburse
the
united
states
the
expense
incurred
by
the
public
treasury
in
affecting
the
people.
if
the
court
pleases
we
believe
starting
point
is
that
the
court
below
held
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
section
10
in
turn
prohibits
the
creation
of
any
not
just
some
but
any
obstruction
not
affirmatively
authorized
by
congress
to
the
navigable
capacity
to
any
of
waters
in
the
united
states.
now
as
this
court
observed
in
republic
steel
case,
the
cause
of
holding
that
industrial
waste
constituted
the
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
term
obstruction
has
been
given
by
the
court,
a
very
broad
reading.
it
encompasses
that
this
court
said
many,
many
years
ago
in
the
rio
grande
irrigation
company,
anything
whatever
done
or
however
done
within
the
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
which
tends
to
destroy
the
navigable
capacity
of
one
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
argued
that
a
sunken
vessel
any
less
than
a
dam
or
industrial
wastes
constitutes
and
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
that
definition.
furthermore,
section
10
as
this
court
observed
in
public
steel
case
was
intended
to
codify
the
existing
law
and
making
1894,
five
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
1899
act
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
have
held
that
a
sunken
vessel
was
an
obstruction
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
of
1890
act,
which
act
contained
similar
language
in
section
10,
section
10
of
1899
statute.
now
being
within
section
10,
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
here
are
under
the
doctrine
of
republic
steel
case
responsible
for
the
removal
of
the
vessel
or
for
the
removal
to
assume
the
costs
of
the
removal
by
the
united
states.
now
the
violation
of
section
10's
prohibition
has
made
it
crime
by
section
12
of
the
act
and
this
is
settled
rule
that
the
disregard
the
command
of
a
penal
statute
is
a
wrongful
act
for
which
the
courts
will
imply
a
right
to
recover
damages
from
the
attending
party.
this
a
rule
which
is
illustrated
by
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
texas
&
pacific
rail
road
versus
rigsby
and
j.i.
case
company
versus
borak
relatively
recent
decision,
377
united
states.
now
we
think
it
was
this
general
principal
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
determination
in
republic
steel
that
despite
the
absence
of
an
express
provision
for
injunctive
relief
that
section
10
carried
with
it
the
implicit
remedy
of
injunction
where
as
here
an
obstruction
to
navigable
waters
have
been
created.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
actually
in
the
republic
steel
case
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
the
united
states
was
not
entitled
to
an
injunction
under
section
10
where
the
obstruction
did
not
constitute
a
structure
and
the
court
had
relied
upon
the
fact
that
section
12
had
conferred
a
specific
right
with
respect
to
structures
and
therefore
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
congress
did
not
intend
injunctive
relief
to
available
where
the
obstruction
did
not
constitute
a
structure
and
this
court
reversed
that
determination
holding
that
the
section
10
taken
in
the
context
of
its
great
design
permitted
the
implication
of
those
remedies,
which
are
appropriate
to
the
carrying
out
of
that
design.
now
we
think
the
injunctive
remedy
is
plainly
within
the
scope
of
permissible
remedies,
indeed
republic
steel
still
holds
and
we
think
as
two
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
that
another
appropriate
remedy
where
necessary
as
this,
the
case
with
wycom
112
is
the
remedy
of
--
of
recovering
removal
costs.
there
is
certainly
no
reason
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
from
paving
why
the
offender
should
escape
his
due
merely
because
the
situation
is
such
the
government
feels
compelled
to
go
into
court
rather
to
remove
the
vessel
at
the
outset
rather
than
to
pursue
its
often
slow
injunctive
remedies.
now
even
if
court
pleases
section
10
did
not
embrace
the
obstruction
in
this
case.
it
is
conceded
as
we
understand
it
that
this
obstruction
created
by
negligence
was
a
violation
of
section
15,
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
voluntarily
or
carelessly
sink
or
permit
or
caused
to
be
sunk
vessels
or
other
crafts
in
navigable
channels.
now
despite
the
fact
section
15
goes
on
to
impose
an
affirmative
express
duty
upon
he
who
causes
an
obstruction,
indeed
causes
an
obstruction
even
innocently
to
remove
the
obstruction,
seek
to
immediately
remove
the
obstruction.
the
position
of
these
petitioners
is
that
they
do
not
need
to
comply
with
that
duty.
all
that
they
need
to
do
is
to
tell
the
core
of
engineers
that
even
though
this
obstruction
was
occasioned
negligently,
even
though
they
have
the
statutory
duty,
they
are
abandoning
the
vessel
and
at
that
point
the
consequences
of
their
negligence
falls
upon
the
united
states
and
upon
the
public
treasury.
now
we
submit
that
there
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
in
that
connection
this.
the
reason
for
the
provisions
in
section
15
and
again
in
section
19
with
respect
to
the
abandonment
of
vessels
was
not
the
immunization
of
negligent
ship
owners
and
others
from
liability
in
these
circumstances.
the
reason
that
these
provisions
were
inserted
and
i
might
say
that
they
apply
not
only
in
the
case
of
negligibly
sunk
vessels,
but
also
in
the
case
of
innocently
sunk
vessels
where
the
vessel
sinks
without
any
fault
upon
the
owner
was
to
provide
immunity
to
the
united
states
if
it
sought
to
remove
the
vessel
and
the
united
states
has
had
to
from
time
to
time
invoke
those
provisions
for
that
purpose.
an
example
of
that
is
the
first
zubik
case,
zubik
against
the
united
states
where
zubik
was
challenging
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
remove
and
to
retain
a
sunken
vessel.
and
as
the
court
observed
in
that
case
the
statute
conferred
upon
the
united
states
the
right
where
the
vessel
has
been
abandoned
by
the
owner,
this
is
irrespective
again
whether
the
owner
is
at
fault
or
not,
to
step
in,
if
it
feels
necessary
to
do
so
to
remove
the
vessel
and
it
is
given
then
the
right
to
disposal
of
the
vessel.
now
there
is
no
suggestion
at
all
that
in
those
provisions,
congress
was
intending
to
change
the
settled
rule
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
an
act
which
i
might
say
until
their
reply
brief
filed
at
least
received
by
us
just
today,
the
petitioners
entirely
ignored.
now
the
limitation
of
liability
act
enacted
in
1851
as
construed
consistently
by
this
court
restricts
the
right
of
the
owner,
ship
owner
to
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel
and
its
cargo
then
pending
that's
after
all
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
do
here
to
cases
in
which
the
loss
or
the
damage
was
without
the
owner's
perfidy
or
fault
or
knowledge
rather
and
that
has
been
construed
by
this
court
to
mean
without
the
owners
fault.
now
it's
utterly
inconceivable
to
us
if
the
court
pleases
that
in
1899
when
congress
was
enacting,
what
again
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
this
great
design
for
the
protection
of
our
navigable
waters,
the
congress
on
the
one
hand
imposed
these
affirmative
responsibilities
upon
the
ship
owner
and
on
the
other
hand
said
to
the
ship
owner
if
you
violate
them
then
your
rights
are
greater
--
are
greater
than
the
rights
which
you
had
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act
of
1851.
it
would
be
we
respectfully
submit
to
attribute
to
congress
a
completely
perverse
intent,
to
subscribe
to
the
view
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
that
congress
intended
that
those
who
negligibly
obstruct
our
waters
to
be
able
to
trust
upon
the
public
treasury,
the
responsibility
for
removing
those
obstructions.
now
if
the
court
pleases
i
think
that
some
just
passing
reference
should
be
made
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
this
rivers
and
harbors
act
as
well
as
most
them
contain
very
little
legislative
history
at
all.
there
is
essentially
what
i
think
are
colloquially
referred
to
pork
barrel
bills.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1899
act
does
indicate
however
that
it
was
not
intended
to
change
existing
law,
but
it
was
a
codification
of
existing
law
and
that
too
i
think
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
republic
steel.
now
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
1880,
the
relevant
provisions
of
1880,
1882
and
1890
acts
and
we
think
that
those
acts
taken
in
combination
certainly
bare
out
our
contention
that
when
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
these
specific
remedies
these
were
remedies
which
were
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states
against
a
suit
by
the
ship
owner
who
might
have
claim
that
his
vessel
has
innocently
sunk
and
if
the
united
states
had
had
no
right
to
remove
it
and
then
to
cart
it
off.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
our
statutory
remedy
that's
correct,
but
this,
we
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
harlan
that
on
that
the
remedy
is
to
be
applied
here
not
only
on
the
basis,
again
of
republic
steel
but
on
the
basis
of
the
principle
illustrated
again
by
the
rigsby
case
to
which
i
referred
before.
now
i
think
that
it
should
bear
a
mention
that
we
do
not
accept
the
petitioner's
position
that
it
has
been
held
11
times
over
a
period
of
40
years
that
these
rights
do
not
exist.
actually
in
the
context
of
a
negligent
ship
owner
the
question
has
come
up
really,
squarely
presented
in
three
cases.
those
were
texmar
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
which
decision
was
against
united
states
by
a
divided
vote
and
the
recent
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
also
was
against
united
states
there
too
by
divided
vote,
judge
browning
dissented
in
the
ninth
circuit,
judge
sobeloff
dissented
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
unanimous
decision
in
the
government's
favor
in
the
case
which
is
before
this
court
at
this
time
for
review.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i'm
saying
that
that
is
the
complete
history
in
terms
of
the
right
of
a
negligent
ship
owner
to
abandon
his
vessel
with
impunity.
now
the
only
other
court
case,
american
case
which
dealt
with
a
negligent
ship
owner
as
such
was
the
second
zubik
case.
in
the
second
zubik
case,
the
court
regarded
section
10
as
applying
to
sunken
vessels
but
it
took
the
position
that
only
in
rem
remedies
were
provided
by
the
act
and
that's
a
position
we
think
is
wrong.
but
it
in
terms
of
the
question
of
the
ship
owner's
right
to
abandon
it
is
just
these
three
cases
about
a
negligent
ship
owner.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
briefly
recapitulate,
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
the
negligence
sinking
of
a
vessel
which
creates
an
obstruction
to
navigation
violates
both
section
10
and
section
15
of
rivers
and
harbors
act.
and
under
this
court’s
decision
in
republic
steel
as
well
as
under
the
settled
principle
reflected
by
this
court’s
decision,
for
example
in
texas
pacific
railway
versus
rigsby,
there
is
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
these
petitioners
either
--
they
can
be
compelled
by
injunction
to
remove
the
vessel
or
the
unite
states
is
required
to
remove
it,
they
can
be
compelled
to
reimburse
the
government
for
removal
expenses.
and
third
that
the
petitioners
cannot
avoid
a
responsibility
by
relying
on
their
abandonment
of
the
vessel,
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
particularly
when
viewed
in
context
of
its
great
design
cannot
be
read
as
repealing
the
limitation
of
the
liability
act
of
1851,
which
act
as
construed
by
this
court
permits
a
ship
owner
to
limit
its
liability
to
the
value
of
its
vessel
and
the
cargo
only
in
circumstances
where
there
is
no
fault
attributable
to
the
ship
owner.
i
might
stress
in
that
connection
that
quite
apart
from
the
matter
of
limitation
of
liability
act
some
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
ship
owners
at
all.
they
were
not
the
owners
of
the
sunken
vessel
as
one,
at
least
one
petitioner
of
each
case
that
falls
into
that
classification
and
the
right
of
abandonment
even
if
it
existed
where
there
has
been
thought
would
not
be
of
any
benefit
to
them.
now
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
one
case
your
honor
the
petitioner
was
the
owner
of
the
boat
which
towed
the
wycam
112.
in
the
other
case
the
cargill,
petitioner
cargill
was
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
mooring
facility
at
which
the
two
barges
were
located
and
one
of
the
allegations
of
negligence
or
at
least
one
of
the
allegations
of
negligence
relates
to
negligent
mooring.
now
we
--
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
i
would
close
by
simply
pointing
out
again
that
as
judge
browning
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
texmar
case
where
he
considered
all
of
these
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
has
relied
that
none
of
them
are
in
point.
in
contrast
to
that
within
a
matter
of
two
years
after
the
passage
of
rivers
and
harbors
act
in
1899,
the
act
was
administratively
construed
by
the
secretary
of
war
as
requiring
in
cases
of
fault,
the
ship
owner
to
remove
the
vessel
and
that
administrative
interpretation
now
appears
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
is
quoted
in
the
government’s
brief.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
are
bills
your
honor,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
such
as
it
is
of
those
bills
to
suggest
that
the
sponsors
of
that
legislation
felt
that
the
existing
law
did
not
provide
the
remedies
which
the
government
urges
flow
from
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
the
reason
for
the
introduction
of
those
bills
was
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
texmar
case
three
or
four
years
ago
and
the
legislation
was
intended
to
be
a
clarification.
and
at
this
juncture
as
i
understand
it
with
the
question
now
before
this
court,
there
is
no
further
endeavor
being
made
with
respect
to
that
legislation.
we
don’t
think
that
the
pendency
of
that
legislation
in
recent
years
in
any
way
reflects
the
view
on
the
part
of
the
congress
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
itself
does
not,
by
implications
under
the
doctrine
of
republic
steel
and
texas
pacific
railway
against
rigsby
provide
the
remedy
which
we
urge
here.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
is
one
committee
report,
i
don’t
think
it
uses
the
word
clarification
as
such,
but
we
think
that
the,
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
the,
this
legislative
history.
we
think
that
the
thrust
of
it
certainly
is
that
the
congress,
at
least
the
sponsors
of
that
legislation
were
very
concerned
about
the
construction
which
had
been
given
the
act
in
the
texmar
case.
and
that
as
i
suggested
yesterday
actually
was
the
first
case
which
had
construed
the
act
as
being
totally
unavailable
in
the
case
of
negligent
ship
owners.
now
the
third
circuit
in
1961
in
united
states
versus
zubik
held
that
a
negligently
sunk
vessel
was
within
section
10
and
that
the
government
could
obtain
an
injunction
requiring
removal.
it's
true
that
the
third
circuit
in
that
case
went
on
the
hold
that,
where
the
government
had
removed
the
vessel
it
was
limited
to
in
rem
remedies,
but
the
texmar
was
the
first
case
which
suggested
that
the
--
a
ship
owner
who
violates
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
not
only
by
creating
an
obstruction
but
then
by
failing
to
fulfill
his
duty
to
remove
can
escape
any
responsibility
by
simply
abandoning
the
vessel.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor
in
most
of
the
earlier
cases
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
most
of
earlier
cases
your
honor
either
did
not
involve
abandonment
or
involve
an
innocent
sinking.
now
for
example
the
manhattan,
which
is
the
case
upon
which
the
petitioners
place
perhaps
the
greatest
reliance,
the
manhattan,
a
government
vessel
had
sunk
through
the
negligence
of
another
and
there
was
not
question
in
the
case.
the
court’s
determination
makes
abundantly
clear
that
the
sinking
was
of
the
government
vessel
insofar
as
the
owner,
the
government
was
concerned
was
entirely
without
fault
and
the
government
endeavored
to
obtain
from
the
tortfeasor,
the
cost
incurred
by
the
government
in
removing
its
own
vessel
and
the
court
said
that
since
the
government
had
not
been
responsible
for
removing
it
since
it
had
the
right
of
abandonment,
therefore
it
could
not
recover
this
cost
since
it
had
no
responsibility
to
remove
in
the
first
instance.
now
not
only
was
the
manhattan
a
sinking,
an
innocent
sinking
insofar
as
the
ship
owner
was
concerned,
but
in
addition
the
manhattan
relied
upon
english
cases
which
as
we
note
in
our
brief
make
it
clear
that
the
right
of
abandonment
is
dependent
upon
the
sinking
being
an
innocent
one.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
united
kingdom
your
honor
has
a
different
statute
that
is
quite
true.
they
also
in
united
kingdom
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct,
that’s
right.
the
english
have
a
different
statute
but
the
english
also
i
might
–
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
if
your
honor
pleases
is
true
although
we
contend
that
united
states
has
a
definite
proprietary
interest
in
the
waters
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
untied
states
and
that
relates
the
our
alternative
contention
which
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below
and
that
is
that
in
addition
to
violating
their
statutory
obligations
the
petitioners
violated
their
long
standing
non-statutory
obligations
recognized
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
the
12
peters
in
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
georgetown
against
the
alexandria
canal
company.
this
is
an
obligation
not
to
create
an
obstruction
in
a
public
or
on
a
public
highway
and
as
this
court
observed
in
the
georgetown
case,
they
involved
the
potomac
river,
navigable
waters
are
public
highways
for
the
purposes
of
the
docking
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
individual
who
creates
a
public
nuisance
in
a
navigable
water
can
be
required
to
remove
that
nuisance.
we
require
through
the
injunctive
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor
it
was
based
upon
a
non-statutory
obligation.
now
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
united
states
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
first
it
has
a
regulatory
interest
stemming
from
its
constitutional
power
to
regulate
commerce
over
our
waterways
and
second
it
has
a
proprietary
interest
not
only
because
it
is
the
guardian
of
the
waters
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
own
those
waters
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
also
because
the
united
states
is
consistently
making
improvements
in
the
navigable
waters.
the
mississippi
in
particular
and
this
we
believe
is
sufficient
under
the
principles
of
such
cases
as
san
jacinto
tin
and
cotton
against
united
states
and
in
re
debts
for
the
united
states
without,
even
with
a
statute
to
assert
the
right
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
this
we
suggest
is
a
recognized
liability.
now
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
point
that
was
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
brief
and
was
reiterated
yesterday
by
mr.
ray
and
that
is
that
the
effect
of
an
affirmance
in
this
case
would
be
to
bankrupt
many
water
carriers
and
we
think
that
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
suggestion
at
all.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
as
this
appears
in
this
record
in
this
case,
the
standard
protection
and
indemnity
insurance
form
covers
this
kind
of
liability.
now
in
the
case
of
substantial
barges
which
are
carrying
chlorine
gas,
the
premiums
needless
to
say
maybe
high,
but
so
i
would
suppose
the
premiums
are
quite
high
on
commercial
airlines.
in
the
case
of
small
fishing
vessels
where
the
risk
is
much
less
where
the
cost
of
removal
would
be
much
smaller
presumably
the
premiums
would
be
much
lower.
but
we
find
it
quite
startling
quite
frankly
that
it
is
contended
that
this
court
should
hold
that
negligent
ship
owners
should
be
insulated
from
the
consequences
of
their
negligence
simply
because
if
they
are
saddled
with
the
consequences
of
that
negligence
it
may
occasion
financial
damage.
i
mean
this
is
a
consequence
which
anyone
in
any
business
must
undertake
and
again
insurance
is
very
definitely
available
in
this
area.
so
for
these
reasons
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
either
both
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
an
implicit
right
conferred
by
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
recover
the
cost
of
removal
or
to
obtain
an
injunction
to
require
a
mobile
or
on
the
ground
that
there
is
a
long
established
common
law
obligation
on
the
part
of
ship
owners
who
create
public
nuisances
in
the
nation's
waterways
which
obligation
can
be
enforced
by
the
united
states.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
your
honor
is
–
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
10
and
15
criminal
liability
would
exist.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
would
be
required--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor
it,
we’ll
i’d
know
actually
i
think
it
maybe
the
--
in
terms
of
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
in
section
15
that
probation
is
tied
in
terms
to
a
voluntary
or
careless
sinking.
mr.

or
careless,
now
by
voluntary
we
take
it
to
mean
intention,
so
that
for
the
purposes
of
section,
of
that
probation
in
section
15
there
would
have
to
be
either
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
your
honor
what
would
i
suppose
be
involved
there
is
would
be
the
question
if
the
issue
arose
to
whether
section
10
applies
to
an
innocent
creation
of
a
obstruction
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
whether
the
term
create
would,
which
is
used
in
section
10
would
keep
out
of
the
ambit
of
section
10
innocent
sinking,
it’s
not
what,
it
might
be
argued
that
one
who
creates,
one
whose
vessel
sinks
without
any
fault
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
owner
has
not
created
an
obstruction
that
the
term
creation
would
carry
with
it
the
implication
it
of
being
either
some,
of
intentional
act
or
some
miss
or
malfeasance.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
--
well
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
your
honor
we
are
not
arguing
that
it
covers
innocent
sinking.
we
say
it
very
definitely
it
does
cover
negligent
sinking.
we
say
beyond
question,
he
who
threw
his
negligence
creates
an
obstruction
in
the
form
of
a
sunken
vessel
and
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here
in
the
allegation
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right
although
i
would
say
that
it’s
very
unlikely
in
the
case
of
innocent
sinking
that
criminal
liability
would
be
sought.
