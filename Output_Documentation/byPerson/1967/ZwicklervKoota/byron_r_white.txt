justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
the
dockets
in
new
york
--
the
new
york
court
just
more
crowded
than
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
in
terms
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
would
you
have
to
wait
in
the
federal
court
if
there's
an
issue
of
fact
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
had
been
on
--
been
a
one-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
a
little
longer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit
longer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
they
send
these
questions
to
the
three-judge
courts
then?
we
don't
have
any
original
jurisdiction.
you
just
can't
file
a
suit
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
actually
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
“pro
forma?”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
which
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
issue
is
whether
this
case
is
certainly
dismissed
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
here
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
departure
from
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
that
take
with
it
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
law?
the
court
could
say
“we're
not
going
to
enjoin
a
threatened
prosecution
or
enforcement
of
the
law”
and
still
make
a
declaration.
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
action
here
had
not
been
for
an
injunction,
that
it
just
been
for
declaratory
judgment.
there
would
have
been
no
three-judge
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
an
injunction
then.
it's
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
deciding
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
--
do
you
say
that
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
on
its
face
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
perfectly
straightforward,
there's
not
much
room
for
construing
the
statute
in
any
particular
regard.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
constitutional
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutional
question
is
right
--
staring
you
right
in
the
face
then
where--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
whatever
port
you
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
rule
--
i
gather,
your
rule
on
abstention
would
be
that,
automatically,
in
any
case
where
the
constitutionality
in
the
state
statute
is
questioned
in
a
federal
court,
the
federal
court
should
abstain
and
let
the
state
court
decide
it
unless
there
are
some
special
circumstances
which
indicate
that
it
ought
to
be
decided
in
federal
court.

this
is

this
your
reading

that
you
--
this
applies
not
only
to
issuing
the
injunction
but
to
deciding
the
basic
question
at
all?
justice
byron

white
assume
that
that
judgment
is
reversed,
the
dismissal
is
reversed,
and
it
is
sent
back
for
trial.
