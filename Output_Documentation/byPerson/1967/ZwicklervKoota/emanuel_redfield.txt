mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
which
a
three-judge
court
was
convened,
and
the
order
denied
the
plaintiff's
application
for
a
temporary
injunction
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
this
case
and
this
review
raises
questions
whether
section
781
(b)
of
the
penal
law,
which
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
renown
that
section
457
of
the
election
law
without
change
of
content,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
law
is
a
prior
restraint
on
speech,
in
that
it
forbids
distribution
of
anonymous
literature
reweighting
to,
i'm
paraphrasing
the
statute,
elections
of
public
offices
and
also
with
respect
to
amendments
to
the
state
constitution.
and,
it
also
raises
the
question
whether
the
three-judge
court
abused
its
discretion
in
abstaining
from
deciding
the
issue
and
in
dismissing
the
complaint.
the
attack
here
by
the
appellant
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
i
should
also
mention
that
there
are
no
issues
of
fact
involved
and,
so
much
so,
that
at
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court
counsel
stipulated
that
a
final
order
might
be
entered
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
lack
of
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
i
go
back
to
the
early
beginnings
of
this
case.
it
had
a
history
in
the
state
of
the
art
courts.
a
few
days
before
the
congressional
elections
in
1964,
my
client,
sanford
zwickler,
stood
in
front
of
a
democratic
political
club
in
brooklyn
new
york,
of
which
club
the
candidate
then
running
for
congress
was
the
leader
and
he
distributed
the
leaflet
which
appears
on
page
6
of
the
record
and
--
which
attacked
this
congressional
candidate's
record
with
respect
to
his
acts
in
congress,
and
the
leaflet
bore
no
name
or
address
and
did
not
comply
with
a
mandate
of
the
statute.
he
was
prosecuted
in
the
criminal
courts
of
new
york
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
attacked
as
being
an
infringement
of
his
rights
of
free
speech
and
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
objection
was
overruled
and,
since
there
has
been
no
controversy
about
the
facts,
he
was
convicted.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
his
counsel
to
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
and
that
court
reversed
this
conviction,
did
not
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
but
merely
said
that
there
was
not--
had
not
been
sufficient
proof
of
a
quantity
of
literature
having
been
distributed
because
the
statute
speaks
of
a
distribution
in
quantity.
the
district
attorney
who
was
the
defendant
in
this
action
pursued
the
case
further
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
our
highest
court,
and
that
court
affirmed
the
prior
reversal
of
the
appellate
term.
that
affirmance
was
in
december
1,
1965.
but,
my
client
who
was
anxious
to
make
such
distribution
but
was
afraid
of
being
prosecuted
again,
he's
a
very
simple
person
but
he
is
civic
minded,
he's
not
a
professional
agitator,
he
hasn't
such
attainments,
he
wanted
to
make
this
distribution
again
and
he
still
wishes
to
make
distribution
but
he
knows
what
he
went
through
in
his
prior
experience
in
new
york
court
by
his
arrest
which
was
a
very
traumatic
affect
upon
him.
so,
he
started
suit
in
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
which
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
the
facts
which
i've
just
stated
of
his
prior
conviction
in
the
reversal.
he
also
alleged
that
he
desires
to
distribute
this
literature
again
for
the
election
of
1966,
at
which
the
same
congressman
was
going
to
be
a
candidate,
and
he
wishes
to
distribute
it
at
subsequent
times.
and,
he
also
alleged
that
he
wishes
to
distribute
it
in
quantities
of
1,000
copies
or
more.
he
also
stated
which
we
could
well
understand,
his
fears
on
the
matter
and
that
he
does
not
wish
to
exercise
these
rights
unless
he
is
protected
by
a
declaratory
judgment.
while
this
came
on
before,
it
convenes
three-judge
court
and
that
court
by
a
2-1
decision
held
that
it
should
abstain
in
the
matter
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
in
othre
words
it's
rather
odd
that
it
abstain
but
refuse
to
hear,
terminated
the
whole
thing.
it
wrote
three
opinions.
each
judge
wrote
an
opinion.
the
majority
held
that
there
was
a
case
and
controversy
involved
but
abstained
for
two
reason,
as
i
make
it
out.
one
is
that
since
the
state
courts
provided
a
remedy
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment,
why
he
should've
gone
to
the
state
courts
and
not
to
the
federal
courts
and,
secondly,
held
that
douglas
against
jeannette
for
that
--
or
at
least
lasted
to
the
court's
discretion
not
to.
it
sort
of
mandated
the
court
not
to
grant
relief
under
the
circumstances.
judge
grosling
wrote
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
he
held
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
abstention
because,
to
him,
the
statute
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
he
held
it
so
be
--
for
three
different
reasons.
he
said
the
statute
was
overbroad
because,
by
its
text,
it
covers
all
campaign
literature
not
merely
scurrilous
and
false.
and,
in
any
event,
the
statute
covered
ideas
like
the
ones
pertaining
to
amendments
to
the
constitution.
and,
the
third
reason
he
gave
was
that
even
if
the
statute
were
limited,
the
fault
and
scurrilous
literature,
as
the
attorney
general
then
urged
as
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
he
said
that
this
violated
the
constitution
because
it
was
clearly
an
infringement
of
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
hadn't.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
my
guess
is,
if
i
recall
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
talley,
i
think
judge
--
justice
clark
in
his
dissent,
in
a
footnote,
said
that
there
were
about
37
states.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
he
said
that.
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
haven't
look
at
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
i'd
like
to
divest
for
just
a
minute,
because
i
think
this
is
very
interesting,
because
at
the
time
of
the
argument
in
the
district
court
the
attorney
general
stated
that
this
statute
pertains
only
to
scurrilous
and
false
statements.
and,
you'll
find
in
the
record
on
page
11
an
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general
in
which
he
stated
that
he
participated
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
but,
in
the
brief
in
this
court,
on
page
11,
you
will
find
that
the
attorney
general
takes
a
different
position.
he
states
that
the
statute
applies
to
all
literature
and
by
--
that
is
anonymous
and
by
“all,”
i
suppose
he
means
--
he
includes
the
innocent
or
non-scurrilous
literature.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
see
no
reason
why
this
court
cannot
do
it.
the
language
read
very
clearly
that
the
text
of
it
doesn't
provide
any
qualifications
on
it.
it's
written
in
perfectly
clear
english,
and
it's
very
similar
to
other
cases
this
court
has
had
like
the
baggett
case
in
which
questions
came
up
as
to
the
validity
of
statutes
of
this
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
justice
--
judge
kaufman
was
a
little
optimistic.
i'll
tell
you
why
because
i've
had
a
lot
of
experience,
which
your
honor
knows,
in
this
area
and
in
the
pfister
case
that
was
cited
--
that
is
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief,
and
which
is
relied
on
so
much
to
point
out
that
new
york
provides
an
expeditious
remedy,
i
wish
to
say
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
expeditious
remedies
in
free
speech
cases
other
than
to
resort
to
the
federal
courts.
and,
even
then,
you
still
have
to
put
up
with
the
difficulties
of
litigation.
now,
i
should
pause
here
to
say
this.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
much
more
so.
i
mean,
when
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
want
you
to
say
it
explicitly,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
it's
--
the
implication
is
there
by
statute.
and,
that
is,
if
you
–
when
--
remember
that
this
is
a
case
where
we
are
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face.
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
open
and
who
could
determine
whether
or
not
this
statute
violates
the
federal
constitution
better
than
this
court
by
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court,
and
by
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
to
decide
it
at
once.
we're
only
talking
here
about
a
statute
that's
being
attacked
on
its
face
and,
to
put
it
in
further,
that
we
have
no
questions
of
fact
involved.
if
you
had
some
of
the
other
situations
that
have
played
in
the
federal
courts
in
recent
years,
i'd
say,
yes,
they
shouldn't
come
here
directly
because
many
of
them
are
irresponsible
and
frivolous
cases.
but,
here,
you
have
a
serious
issue
of
constitutionality
and
i
would
say
that
this
court
is
the
best
court
and
the
most
expeditious
court
in
which
to
have
such
a
determination
made.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
an
expedition
is
a
very
important
factor
in
speech.
some
of
your
honors
might
remember
when
i
had
a
case,
say,
many
years
ago,
ellis
against
dickson,
where
the
question
was
that
where
the
free
speech
involved
with
respect
to
the
korean
war,
and
when
those
--
that
case
worked
its
way
through
the
courts
and
back
again
and
up
again,
five
years
out
of
that
and
the
korean
war
had
gone
into
history.
so,
i
say
there's
nothing
that
--
since
expedition
is
so
necessary,
what
better
remedy
is
there
in
this
court
for
the
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
i
don't
see
how.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
prudence.
i
think
the
federal
courts
are
still
in
existence.
i
think
their
jurisdiction
has
been
delineated
by
congress
and
there's
no
reason
why
one
should
not
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
prudence
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
a
judgment,
i
mean.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
what
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
meant
prudence
on
part
of
the
lawyer
in
choosing
the
floor
on
which
to
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i
meant.
i
--
i
could
get
this
issues
decided
in
the
state
courts
too,
but
if
my
experience
dictated
that
the
best
way
to
get
it
done
expeditiously
was
this
way,
i'd
say
that
the
prudence
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
judge,
it
isn't
my
fault.
i
--
i
wish
to
state
that
much.
for
example,
the
ellis
against
dickson
case,
with
which
your
honors
should
be
acquainted
with
because
you
wrote
the
opinion
there,
that
was
done
most
expeditiously
but,
because
of
litigation,
you
have
the
problems
and
delays.
now,
take
this
pfister
case,
and
i'd
like
to
revert
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
it
isn't
only
the
docket
that's
involved.
it's
the
manner
of
procedure.
it's
--
you
have
to
go
through
various
courts
and
it
takes
time.
if
--
if
there
should
be
a
factual
question
involved,
you
have
examination
before
trial,
you
have
this
and
you
have
that,
and
trial
waiting.
if
i
--
if
i
took
this
case
to
the
new
york
state
court
and
if
there
were
an
issue
of
fact
involved,
i'd
have
to
wait
a
year-and-a
half
just
to
wait
my
turn
on
the
calendar.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
i
--
i
actually
had
a
case
like
that
of
free
speech
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
if
a
--
if
the
three-judge
court
is
convened
as
it
was
here,
i'd
say
with
the
trial
and
everything,
two
months
at
the
most.
with
decision,
i'd
say
two
months
at
the
most.
and,
congress
has
so
provided
for
it
for
an
expeditious
determination.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
there,
i'd
say
it
would
be
a
question
then
whether
i
would
use
my
judgment
or
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
would
be
a
little
longer
if
there
were
factual
questions
involved,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
but
of
course
i'm
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
there
is.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
yes
to
any
question
of
the
dissemination
of
ideas.
i
--
i
think
delay
works
to
the
detriment.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
but
if
the
courts
exists
and
the
doors
are
open
for
such
a
remedy
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
the
delay
would
be
an
impairment
of
that
right,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
it
would
injure.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
--
i
would
say
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
does
because
the
--
any
obstacle
that's
placed
in
a
way
of
a
man's
speaking
or
distributing
literature
is
a
denial
of
that
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
well,
that
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
injury,
i
would
say,
is
--
i
just
have
to
repeat
myself
that
he
cannot
act.
he
said--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
said
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
distribution.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
of
this
literature.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
and,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
factor.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he's
running
for
political
office
again
this
year.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
so.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
in
this
case,
you
mean?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
that's
the
only
one.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
that's
--
no,
the
appellee--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
actually
is
referring
to
some
other
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
now,
the
--
this
case,
your
honors,
is
not
one
--
it
should
be
remembered
it's
not
one
like
that
case
of
stefanelli
against
minard
case
where
a
prosecution
has
been
pending
at
the
time
and
it
was
sought
to
enjoin
such
a
prosecution.
i
know
you
had
several
cases
in
this
court
recently
involving
section
2254,
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
that
--
this
is
not
that
sort
of
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
thread
of
the
statute
exists
and
has
a
dynamic
prosecutor
and
what
were
the
political
personage
involved
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
that
my
men
has
good
cause
for
feeling
as
he
does,
that
he
will
be
prosecuted
again.
and,
i
am
not
humorous
or
facetious
when
i
say
that
he
is
not
merely
chilled
but
he
is
actually
frozen.
he
is
frozen
in
the
sense
that
he
cannot
do
what
he
wants
to
do.
he's
had
his
experience
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
is
there
anything
here
to
be
construed?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
attorney
general
says
there's
nothing
to
be
construed
here
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
why
should
it
be?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i
say.
i
said
that
at
the
beginning.
it
dismissed
the
action.
it
didn't
abstain
in
the
true
sense
and
say
“go
back
to
the
state
court
and
wait
for
a
ruling
then
come
back
again.”
it
just
dismissed
the
complaint.
that's
what
i
can't
understand
about
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i'm
asking
for
relief
here
because
of
the
stipulation
between
counsel
that
this
court
adjudicate
the
issue
by
declaring
this
statute
to
be
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
know.
that's
true,
but
what's
to
be
gained
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
what's
to
be
gained
by
sending
it
back?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that
would
be
pro
forma.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
mean,
if
the
court
will
merely
send
it
back
like
it
did
the
everest
case,
well,
without
saying
much
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
that's
one
thing.
but,
if
the
court
speaks
or
rules
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
well,
why
should
you?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that's
not
the
only
issue
involved
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that
would
just
be
delaying
the
thing
or
i'm
merely
thinking
in
terms
of
expedition
because
counsel
here
have
stipulated
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but,
in
this
case,
it's
a
serious
question.
justice
bree
in
the
coolist
case,
he
was
a
very
good
lawyer
in
connection
with
this
type
of
litigation,
exacerbation,
and
that's
putting
it
mildly.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
the
baggett
case
and
--
on
the
question
of
abstention,
is
that
it?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
but,
in
saying
that,
however,
i
should
like
to
comment
on
what
the
appellee
urged,
and
the
district
court
said
--
took
a
point
of
view
that
dombrowski
was
different
from
douglas
against
jeannette
only
because
there
was
violence
involved.
it
was
a
big
mob
situation
and,
therefore,
this
court
had
to
step
in,
but
i
submit
that
that
isn't
the
fair
distinction.
i
think
this
case
is
very
similar
to
dombrowski
and
that
is
that
this
man's
rights
are
being
chilled
and,
unless
some
relief
is
afforded
to
him,
he
can't
act.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
i
don't
think
that
that
element
is
a
big
factor
that
takes
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
think,
and
as
i
read
it
with
elation,
was
that
the
court
has
reached
a
point
of
realizing
what
goes
on
in
the
real
world
and
that
what
people
--
when
people
wish
to
speak
what
they're
up
against.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
well,
it
isn't
all
together
clear
because
it's
quite
an
extensive
opinion,
but--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and,
how
many?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
didn't
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
i
didn't
think
that
that
was
a
critical
basis
or
a
critical
distinction.
to
me,
it
seemed
that
the
court
had
arrived
at
a
conclusion
where
that
--
the
chilling
effect
of
these
statutes
that
invade
one's
right
of
expression
should
be
determined
in
advance
of
prosecution.
that's
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
that's
a
lie
at
dombrowski.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
in
my
brief,
i
pointed
out
something
which
i'd
often
thought
about.
i
never
had
occasion
to
talk
about
it,
that
is,
that
i
always
thought
douglas
against
jeannette,
for
what
is
being
cited,
is
just
a
dictum
because
the
decision
of
the
court
went
off
on
an
entirely
different
basis
from
what
was
said.
in
that
case,
they
were
sought
to
have
the
--
an
ordinance
enjoined
because
of
its
invalidity
and,
that
very
same
day,
this
court--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
so
that
there
was
no
sense
in
really
passing
upon
it
on
the
simple
common
law
principle
that
equity
doesn't
do
silly
things
or
useless
things.
thank
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
just
want
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
controvert
some
remarks
made
here,
your
honor.
if
you
please,
as
to
what
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
very
few,
i
have
about
four.
as
to
it
being
a
case
in
controversy,
that
issue
was
tended
and
decided
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
clearly
held
that
there
was
a
case
in
controversy
involved
here.
the
case
is
very
similar
to
the
evans
against
wyeth
case
that
this
court
decided
some
years
ago.
if
you
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
some
negro
boy
down
south
tried
to
sit
in
the
part
of
a
bus
reserved
for
white
people
and
who
was
threatened
with
arrest,
and
he
got
off
the
bus
rather
than
being
arrested
but
he
entered
suit
in
the
district
court
for
an
injunction
and
declaration
of
the
invalidity
of
the
ordinance
that
required
him
to
sit
in
that
part
of
the
bus.
and,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
and
held
that
there
was
a
controversy
that
should
be
decided.
so,
this
case
is
analogous
on
all
fours
with
that
even
against
wyeth
case.
now,
another
thing
i'd
like
to
refer
to
is
something
that
was
personal
that
was
tended
here.
and
to
which,
i
wish
to
draw
your
attention.
that
is
as
to
whether
or
not
that
this
case
was
a
genuine
case.
i
--
i
say
to
your
honors
here
that,
in
the
34
years
i've
been
meddling
about
this
court,
appeared
here
in
numerable
times,
i
--
this
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
heard
a
remark
made
that
this
mr.
zwickler
sought
out
a
test
case
or
sought
to
be
arrested
so
he
could
have
a
case.
on
the
contrary,
knowing
this
case
from
its
inception,
i
represent
to
you
that
this
was
a
traumatic
experience
to
this
young
man,
an
experience
which
he
has
sought
to
avoid
by
declaratory
relief.
and,
i
would
also
like
to
say
to
your
honors
this
that
you've
seen
the
demonstration
of
pamphlet
waiving
in
front
of
you
reminiscent
to
some
not
so
long
ago
experiences.
i'd
like
your
honors
to
see
that
pamphlet
to
see
how
silly
it
all
is
and
how
silly
the
representation
made
to
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that
he
--
he
has
it.
i'm
tal
--
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
he
said
there's
a
pamphlet
now
in
which
he
signed
his
name
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
mr.
zwickler
other
than
somebody
in
somebody's
letter
mentioned
mr.
zwickler
among
tens
of
other
people
down
at
the
bottom
of
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
he
didn't
sign
it.
i'd
like
you
to
see
it.
it's
signed
by
a
mr.
--
somebody
else,
a
david
cohn
referring
to
a
--
in
support
of
a
mel
doblin
--
dubin
for
congress.
and
then
at
the
end
of
it,
he
enumerates
various
organizations
who
were
supporting
the
candidacy
in
which
he
mentions
zwickler
as
one
of
them.
that's
all.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
which
a
three-judge
court
was
convened,
and
the
order
denied
the
plaintiff's
application
for
a
temporary
injunction
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
this
case
and
this
review
raises
questions
whether
section
781
(b)
of
the
penal
law,
which
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
renown
that
section
457
of
the
election
law
without
change
of
content,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
law
is
a
prior
restraint
on
speech,
in
that
it
forbids
distribution
of
anonymous
literature
reweighting
to,
i'm
paraphrasing
the
statute,
elections
of
public
offices
and
also
with
respect
to
amendments
to
the
state
constitution.
and,
it
also
raises
the
question
whether
the
three-judge
court
abused
its
discretion
in
abstaining
from
deciding
the
issue
and
in
dismissing
the
complaint.
the
attack
here
by
the
appellant
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
i
should
also
mention
that
there
are
no
issues
of
fact
involved
and,
so
much
so,
that
at
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court
counsel
stipulated
that
a
final
order
might
be
entered
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
lack
of
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
i
go
back
to
the
early
beginnings
of
this
case.
it
had
a
history
in
the
state
of
the
art
courts.
a
few
days
before
the
congressional
elections
in
1964,
my
client,
sanford
zwickler,
stood
in
front
of
a
democratic
political
club
in
brooklyn
new
york,
of
which
club
the
candidate
then
running
for
congress
was
the
leader
and
he
distributed
the
leaflet
which
appears
on
page
6
of
the
record
and
--
which
attacked
this
congressional
candidate's
record
with
respect
to
his
acts
in
congress,
and
the
leaflet
bore
no
name
or
address
and
did
not
comply
with
a
mandate
of
the
statute.
he
was
prosecuted
in
the
criminal
courts
of
new
york
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
attacked
as
being
an
infringement
of
his
rights
of
free
speech
and
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
objection
was
overruled
and,
since
there
has
been
no
controversy
about
the
facts,
he
was
convicted.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
his
counsel
to
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
and
that
court
reversed
this
conviction,
did
not
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
but
merely
said
that
there
was
not--
had
not
been
sufficient
proof
of
a
quantity
of
literature
having
been
distributed
because
the
statute
speaks
of
a
distribution
in
quantity.
the
district
attorney
who
was
the
defendant
in
this
action
pursued
the
case
further
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
our
highest
court,
and
that
court
affirmed
the
prior
reversal
of
the
appellate
term.
that
affirmance
was
in
december
1,
1965.
but,
my
client
who
was
anxious
to
make
such
distribution
but
was
afraid
of
being
prosecuted
again,
he's
a
very
simple
person
but
he
is
civic
minded,
he's
not
a
professional
agitator,
he
hasn't
such
attainments,
he
wanted
to
make
this
distribution
again
and
he
still
wishes
to
make
distribution
but
he
knows
what
he
went
through
in
his
prior
experience
in
new
york
court
by
his
arrest
which
was
a
very
traumatic
affect
upon
him.
so,
he
started
suit
in
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
which
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
the
facts
which
i've
just
stated
of
his
prior
conviction
in
the
reversal.
he
also
alleged
that
he
desires
to
distribute
this
literature
again
for
the
election
of
1966,
at
which
the
same
congressman
was
going
to
be
a
candidate,
and
he
wishes
to
distribute
it
at
subsequent
times.
and,
he
also
alleged
that
he
wishes
to
distribute
it
in
quantities
of
1,000
copies
or
more.
he
also
stated
which
we
could
well
understand,
his
fears
on
the
matter
and
that
he
does
not
wish
to
exercise
these
rights
unless
he
is
protected
by
a
declaratory
judgment.
while
this
came
on
before,
it
convenes
three-judge
court
and
that
court
by
a
2-1
decision
held
that
it
should
abstain
in
the
matter
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
in
othre
words
it's
rather
odd
that
it
abstain
but
refuse
to
hear,
terminated
the
whole
thing.
it
wrote
three
opinions.
each
judge
wrote
an
opinion.
the
majority
held
that
there
was
a
case
and
controversy
involved
but
abstained
for
two
reason,
as
i
make
it
out.
one
is
that
since
the
state
courts
provided
a
remedy
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment,
why
he
should've
gone
to
the
state
courts
and
not
to
the
federal
courts
and,
secondly,
held
that
douglas
against
jeannette
for
that
--
or
at
least
lasted
to
the
court's
discretion
not
to.
it
sort
of
mandated
the
court
not
to
grant
relief
under
the
circumstances.
judge
grosling
wrote
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
he
held
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
abstention
because,
to
him,
the
statute
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
he
held
it
so
be
--
for
three
different
reasons.
he
said
the
statute
was
overbroad
because,
by
its
text,
it
covers
all
campaign
literature
not
merely
scurrilous
and
false.
and,
in
any
event,
the
statute
covered
ideas
like
the
ones
pertaining
to
amendments
to
the
constitution.
and,
the
third
reason
he
gave
was
that
even
if
the
statute
were
limited,
the
fault
and
scurrilous
literature,
as
the
attorney
general
then
urged
as
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
he
said
that
this
violated
the
constitution
because
it
was
clearly
an
infringement
of
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
hadn't.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
my
guess
is,
if
i
recall
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
talley,
i
think
judge
--
justice
clark
in
his
dissent,
in
a
footnote,
said
that
there
were
about
37
states.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
he
said
that.
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
haven't
look
at
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
i'd
like
to
divest
for
just
a
minute,
because
i
think
this
is
very
interesting,
because
at
the
time
of
the
argument
in
the
district
court
the
attorney
general
stated
that
this
statute
pertains
only
to
scurrilous
and
false
statements.
and,
you'll
find
in
the
record
on
page
11
an
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general
in
which
he
stated
that
he
participated
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
but,
in
the
brief
in
this
court,
on
page
11,
you
will
find
that
the
attorney
general
takes
a
different
position.
he
states
that
the
statute
applies
to
all
literature
and
by
--
that
is
anonymous
and
by
“all,”
i
suppose
he
means
--
he
includes
the
innocent
or
non-scurrilous
literature.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
see
no
reason
why
this
court
cannot
do
it.
the
language
read
very
clearly
that
the
text
of
it
doesn't
provide
any
qualifications
on
it.
it's
written
in
perfectly
clear
english,
and
it's
very
similar
to
other
cases
this
court
has
had
like
the
baggett
case
in
which
questions
came
up
as
to
the
validity
of
statutes
of
this
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
justice
--
judge
kaufman
was
a
little
optimistic.
i'll
tell
you
why
because
i've
had
a
lot
of
experience,
which
your
honor
knows,
in
this
area
and
in
the
pfister
case
that
was
cited
--
that
is
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief,
and
which
is
relied
on
so
much
to
point
out
that
new
york
provides
an
expeditious
remedy,
i
wish
to
say
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
expeditious
remedies
in
free
speech
cases
other
than
to
resort
to
the
federal
courts.
and,
even
then,
you
still
have
to
put
up
with
the
difficulties
of
litigation.
now,
i
should
pause
here
to
say
this.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
much
more
so.
i
mean,
when
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
want
you
to
say
it
explicitly,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
it's
--
the
implication
is
there
by
statute.
and,
that
is,
if
you
–
when
--
remember
that
this
is
a
case
where
we
are
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face.
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
open
and
who
could
determine
whether
or
not
this
statute
violates
the
federal
constitution
better
than
this
court
by
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court,
and
by
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
to
decide
it
at
once.
we're
only
talking
here
about
a
statute
that's
being
attacked
on
its
face
and,
to
put
it
in
further,
that
we
have
no
questions
of
fact
involved.
if
you
had
some
of
the
other
situations
that
have
played
in
the
federal
courts
in
recent
years,
i'd
say,
yes,
they
shouldn't
come
here
directly
because
many
of
them
are
irresponsible
and
frivolous
cases.
but,
here,
you
have
a
serious
issue
of
constitutionality
and
i
would
say
that
this
court
is
the
best
court
and
the
most
expeditious
court
in
which
to
have
such
a
determination
made.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
an
expedition
is
a
very
important
factor
in
speech.
some
of
your
honors
might
remember
when
i
had
a
case,
say,
many
years
ago,
ellis
against
dickson,
where
the
question
was
that
where
the
free
speech
involved
with
respect
to
the
korean
war,
and
when
those
--
that
case
worked
its
way
through
the
courts
and
back
again
and
up
again,
five
years
out
of
that
and
the
korean
war
had
gone
into
history.
so,
i
say
there's
nothing
that
--
since
expedition
is
so
necessary,
what
better
remedy
is
there
in
this
court
for
the
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
i
don't
see
how.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
prudence.
i
think
the
federal
courts
are
still
in
existence.
i
think
their
jurisdiction
has
been
delineated
by
congress
and
there's
no
reason
why
one
should
not
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
prudence
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
a
judgment,
i
mean.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
what
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
meant
prudence
on
part
of
the
lawyer
in
choosing
the
floor
on
which
to
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i
meant.
i
--
i
could
get
this
issues
decided
in
the
state
courts
too,
but
if
my
experience
dictated
that
the
best
way
to
get
it
done
expeditiously
was
this
way,
i'd
say
that
the
prudence
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
judge,
it
isn't
my
fault.
i
--
i
wish
to
state
that
much.
for
example,
the
ellis
against
dickson
case,
with
which
your
honors
should
be
acquainted
with
because
you
wrote
the
opinion
there,
that
was
done
most
expeditiously
but,
because
of
litigation,
you
have
the
problems
and
delays.
now,
take
this
pfister
case,
and
i'd
like
to
revert
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
it
isn't
only
the
docket
that's
involved.
it's
the
manner
of
procedure.
it's
--
you
have
to
go
through
various
courts
and
it
takes
time.
if
--
if
there
should
be
a
factual
question
involved,
you
have
examination
before
trial,
you
have
this
and
you
have
that,
and
trial
waiting.
if
i
--
if
i
took
this
case
to
the
new
york
state
court
and
if
there
were
an
issue
of
fact
involved,
i'd
have
to
wait
a
year-and-a
half
just
to
wait
my
turn
on
the
calendar.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
i
--
i
actually
had
a
case
like
that
of
free
speech
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
if
a
--
if
the
three-judge
court
is
convened
as
it
was
here,
i'd
say
with
the
trial
and
everything,
two
months
at
the
most.
with
decision,
i'd
say
two
months
at
the
most.
and,
congress
has
so
provided
for
it
for
an
expeditious
determination.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
there,
i'd
say
it
would
be
a
question
then
whether
i
would
use
my
judgment
or
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
would
be
a
little
longer
if
there
were
factual
questions
involved,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
but
of
course
i'm
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
there
is.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
yes
to
any
question
of
the
dissemination
of
ideas.
i
--
i
think
delay
works
to
the
detriment.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
but
if
the
courts
exists
and
the
doors
are
open
for
such
a
remedy
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
the
delay
would
be
an
impairment
of
that
right,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
it
would
injure.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
--
i
would
say
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
does
because
the
--
any
obstacle
that's
placed
in
a
way
of
a
man's
speaking
or
distributing
literature
is
a
denial
of
that
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
well,
that
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
injury,
i
would
say,
is
--
i
just
have
to
repeat
myself
that
he
cannot
act.
he
said--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
said
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
distribution.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
of
this
literature.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
and,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
factor.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he's
running
for
political
office
again
this
year.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
so.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
in
this
case,
you
mean?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
think
that's
the
only
one.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
that's
--
no,
the
appellee--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
actually
is
referring
to
some
other
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
now,
the
--
this
case,
your
honors,
is
not
one
--
it
should
be
remembered
it's
not
one
like
that
case
of
stefanelli
against
minard
case
where
a
prosecution
has
been
pending
at
the
time
and
it
was
sought
to
enjoin
such
a
prosecution.
i
know
you
had
several
cases
in
this
court
recently
involving
section
2254,
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
that
--
this
is
not
that
sort
of
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
thread
of
the
statute
exists
and
has
a
dynamic
prosecutor
and
what
were
the
political
personage
involved
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
that
my
men
has
good
cause
for
feeling
as
he
does,
that
he
will
be
prosecuted
again.
and,
i
am
not
humorous
or
facetious
when
i
say
that
he
is
not
merely
chilled
but
he
is
actually
frozen.
he
is
frozen
in
the
sense
that
he
cannot
do
what
he
wants
to
do.
he's
had
his
experience
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
is
there
anything
here
to
be
construed?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
attorney
general
says
there's
nothing
to
be
construed
here
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
why
should
it
be?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i
say.
i
said
that
at
the
beginning.
it
dismissed
the
action.
it
didn't
abstain
in
the
true
sense
and
say
“go
back
to
the
state
court
and
wait
for
a
ruling
then
come
back
again.”
it
just
dismissed
the
complaint.
that's
what
i
can't
understand
about
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i'm
asking
for
relief
here
because
of
the
stipulation
between
counsel
that
this
court
adjudicate
the
issue
by
declaring
this
statute
to
be
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
know.
that's
true,
but
what's
to
be
gained
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
what's
to
be
gained
by
sending
it
back?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that
would
be
pro
forma.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
mean,
if
the
court
will
merely
send
it
back
like
it
did
the
everest
case,
well,
without
saying
much
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
that's
one
thing.
but,
if
the
court
speaks
or
rules
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
well,
why
should
you?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that's
not
the
only
issue
involved
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
that
would
just
be
delaying
the
thing
or
i'm
merely
thinking
in
terms
of
expedition
because
counsel
here
have
stipulated
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but,
in
this
case,
it's
a
serious
question.
justice
bree
in
the
coolist
case,
he
was
a
very
good
lawyer
in
connection
with
this
type
of
litigation,
exacerbation,
and
that's
putting
it
mildly.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
the
baggett
case
and
--
on
the
question
of
abstention,
is
that
it?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
but,
in
saying
that,
however,
i
should
like
to
comment
on
what
the
appellee
urged,
and
the
district
court
said
--
took
a
point
of
view
that
dombrowski
was
different
from
douglas
against
jeannette
only
because
there
was
violence
involved.
it
was
a
big
mob
situation
and,
therefore,
this
court
had
to
step
in,
but
i
submit
that
that
isn't
the
fair
distinction.
i
think
this
case
is
very
similar
to
dombrowski
and
that
is
that
this
man's
rights
are
being
chilled
and,
unless
some
relief
is
afforded
to
him,
he
can't
act.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
i
don't
think
that
that
element
is
a
big
factor
that
takes
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
think,
and
as
i
read
it
with
elation,
was
that
the
court
has
reached
a
point
of
realizing
what
goes
on
in
the
real
world
and
that
what
people
--
when
people
wish
to
speak
what
they're
up
against.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
well,
it
isn't
all
together
clear
because
it's
quite
an
extensive
opinion,
but--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and,
how
many?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
didn't
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
i
didn't
think
that
that
was
a
critical
basis
or
a
critical
distinction.
to
me,
it
seemed
that
the
court
had
arrived
at
a
conclusion
where
that
--
the
chilling
effect
of
these
statutes
that
invade
one's
right
of
expression
should
be
determined
in
advance
of
prosecution.
that's
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
that's
a
lie
at
dombrowski.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
--
in
my
brief,
i
pointed
out
something
which
i'd
often
thought
about.
i
never
had
occasion
to
talk
about
it,
that
is,
that
i
always
thought
douglas
against
jeannette,
for
what
is
being
cited,
is
just
a
dictum
because
the
decision
of
the
court
went
off
on
an
entirely
different
basis
from
what
was
said.
in
that
case,
they
were
sought
to
have
the
--
an
ordinance
enjoined
because
of
its
invalidity
and,
that
very
same
day,
this
court--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
so
that
there
was
no
sense
in
really
passing
upon
it
on
the
simple
common
law
principle
that
equity
doesn't
do
silly
things
or
useless
things.
thank
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
just
want
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
controvert
some
remarks
made
here,
your
honor.
if
you
please,
as
to
what
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
very
few,
i
have
about
four.
as
to
it
being
a
case
in
controversy,
that
issue
was
tended
and
decided
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
clearly
held
that
there
was
a
case
in
controversy
involved
here.
the
case
is
very
similar
to
the
evans
against
wyeth
case
that
this
court
decided
some
years
ago.
if
you
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
some
negro
boy
down
south
tried
to
sit
in
the
part
of
a
bus
reserved
for
white
people
and
who
was
threatened
with
arrest,
and
he
got
off
the
bus
rather
than
being
arrested
but
he
entered
suit
in
the
district
court
for
an
injunction
and
declaration
of
the
invalidity
of
the
ordinance
that
required
him
to
sit
in
that
part
of
the
bus.
and,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
and
held
that
there
was
a
controversy
that
should
be
decided.
so,
this
case
is
analogous
on
all
fours
with
that
even
against
wyeth
case.
now,
another
thing
i'd
like
to
refer
to
is
something
that
was
personal
that
was
tended
here.
and
to
which,
i
wish
to
draw
your
attention.
that
is
as
to
whether
or
not
that
this
case
was
a
genuine
case.
i
--
i
say
to
your
honors
here
that,
in
the
34
years
i've
been
meddling
about
this
court,
appeared
here
in
numerable
times,
i
--
this
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
heard
a
remark
made
that
this
mr.
zwickler
sought
out
a
test
case
or
sought
to
be
arrested
so
he
could
have
a
case.
on
the
contrary,
knowing
this
case
from
its
inception,
i
represent
to
you
that
this
was
a
traumatic
experience
to
this
young
man,
an
experience
which
he
has
sought
to
avoid
by
declaratory
relief.
and,
i
would
also
like
to
say
to
your
honors
this
that
you've
seen
the
demonstration
of
pamphlet
waiving
in
front
of
you
reminiscent
to
some
not
so
long
ago
experiences.
i'd
like
your
honors
to
see
that
pamphlet
to
see
how
silly
it
all
is
and
how
silly
the
representation
made
to
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that
he
--
he
has
it.
i'm
tal
--
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
he
said
there's
a
pamphlet
now
in
which
he
signed
his
name
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
mr.
zwickler
other
than
somebody
in
somebody's
letter
mentioned
mr.
zwickler
among
tens
of
other
people
down
at
the
bottom
of
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
he
didn't
sign
it.
i'd
like
you
to
see
it.
it's
signed
by
a
mr.
--
somebody
else,
a
david
cohn
referring
to
a
--
in
support
of
a
mel
doblin
--
dubin
for
congress.
and
then
at
the
end
of
it,
he
enumerates
various
organizations
who
were
supporting
the
candidacy
in
which
he
mentions
zwickler
as
one
of
them.
that's
all.
thank
you
very
much.
