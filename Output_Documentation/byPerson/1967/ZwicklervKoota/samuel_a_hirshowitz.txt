mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
had
some
hearing
impairment
this
morning.
i
hope
the
court
will
take
that
in
consideration
in
using
the
amplifiers.
thank
you.
the
chief
justice
asked
how
many
states
had
statutes
similar
to
new
york.
according
to
our
brief,
there
are
36
states
having
--
36
states
having
similar
statutes
and,
in
two
states,
the
supreme
court
of
each
of
the
states
of
california
and
pennsylvania
have
upheld
the
statutes
against
first
amendment
challenges.
in
addition,
the
prototype
of
all
of
these
statutes
as
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act,
section
612,
which
was
upheld
there
a
few
years
ago
in
us
against
scott,
a
district
court
case,
involving
literature
circulate
with
respect
to
senator
brady.
the
origin
of
the
statute
goes
back
to
the
1940
election
when
literature
--
anonymous
literature
of
highly
emotional
content
was
circulate
throughout
the
country
as
a
result
of
which
the
then
attorney
general
jackson
appointed
a
special
assistant
and
a
special
grand
jury
as
a
result
and
the
culmination
of
that
was
a
recommendation
which,
among
other
things,
recommended
a
statute
similar
to
the
one
in
new
york
now.
it
said
in
their
report,
“we
recommend
amending
the
corrupt
practices
act
to
prohibit
circulation
through
united
states
mail
of
any
and
all
literature,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
influence
the
election
of
candidates
for
federal
office
or
presidential,
advice
presidential
electors,
or
the
enactment
of
the
feet
of
measures
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
unless
it
is
signed
by
the
person
or
persons
or
committee
or
organization
responsible
for
its
circulation,
together
with
their
addresses.
we
also
suggest
that
all
such
printed
matter
contained
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
person,
persons,
committee,
or
organization
responsible
for
the
printing.”
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
floor
of
congress,
there
was
much
discussion
about
this
recommendation
particularly
by
senator
gillette
on
the
congressional
record
who
has
copious
references
to
the
need
for
the
legislation.
in
19
--
the
original
new
york
statute
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
i
just
wanted
to
give
the
court
--
in
approaching
the
question
whether
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court,
properly
decided
the
question
of
whether
the
appellant
should
be
relegated
to
the
state
court,
i
consider
it
important
to
set
forth
to
this
court
the
nature
of
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with.
now,
this
statute
does
not,
in
any
way,
censor
or
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
any
material
at
all.
it
merely
says,
in
substance,
that
if
you're
going
to
distribute
literature
with
respect
to
any
candidate
or
any
proposition
on
the
ballot,
that
you
must
identify
in
some
way
a
name
or
the
name
of
the
organization.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
discussion
about
my
inline
adversary,
he
used
the
word
which
is
being
preempted,
the
word
“chill”
and
he
said
his
client
was
frozen.
well,
apparently,
he
forgot
his
client
is
not
so
frozen
because,
in
connection
with
a
very
judicial
convention
for
congressman
molter,
which
mr.
justice,
i
think,
brennan
referred
to,
mr.
zwickler
issued
literature
on
the
date
of
august
25,
1967.
and,
he
has
this
name
on
it
and
it
makes
of
course
derogatory
references
to
congressman
molter,
so
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
he
has
his
name
on
it.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
he's
not
prohibiting
the
statute.
no,
he
is
not
acting
in
prohibition
of
the
statute,
but
i
just
wanted
to
address
myself
a
question
he
said
--
my
adversary
said
that
his
client
is
frozen,
that
he
can't
do
anything
and
i'm
saying
he's
not
so
frozen
that
he
can't
issue
this
literature.
now,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint,
following
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
dombrowski
case
that
the
principle
of
federalism
should
be
respected
where
an
injunction
is
sought
against
the
threat
in
criminal
prosecution.
and,
in
the
dombrowski
case,
the
majority
opinion
said
that
there
was
special
circumstances
which
justified
the
departure
from
the
role
of
federalism,
and
the
state
maintains
and
maintained
before
the
district
court
that
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
any
of
these
circumstances
which
justify
the
departure
from
the
respect
for
federalism.
and,
record
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
from
this
respect
for
federalism
which
was
set
forth
not
only
in
dombrowski
case
but
in
many
prior
cases.
they
were
all
--
while
the
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
and
is
--
has
the
authority
by
act
of
congress
to
pass
on
federal
questions,
i
think
the
principle
set
forth
in
douglas
against
the
jeannette
is
that
where
an
injunction
is
sought
against
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
the
plaintiff
would
be
relegated
to
the
state
courts
unless
he
produces
special
circumstances.
in
the
dombrowski
case
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we'd
make
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
the
same
argument
because,
in
essence,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
whether
you
label
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
well
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
whether
you
label
it
an
injunction
or
not,
it
would
be
in
a
nature
of
a
similar
relief
because
he
would
be
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
district
attorney
or
the
law
offices
of
new
york
state
could
not
properly
prosecute
him.
now,
the
--
this,
actually,
is
a
test
case
arranged
by
the
appellant
in
this
case
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
bringing
this
question
before
this
court.
my
adversary
pointed
out
that
what
this
appellant
did
was
not
only
seek
to
circulate
this
anonymous
literature
but,
in
a
very
hot
emotional
political
contest,
he
planted
himself
right
in
front
of
the
democratic
headquarters
of
congressman
molter
and
proceeded
verbally
and
with
the
aid
of
this
literature
to
assail
the
congressman.
in
addition
to
which,
the
arrest
was
not
made
by
a
police
officer.
the
appellant
before
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
club,
went
to
the
police
precinct
to
tell
a
policeman
apparently,
although
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
that
he
was
going
to
do
what
he
subsequently
did
to
make
sure
that
the
policeman
came
there
and
arrested
him
so
he
would
have
the
test
case,
but
the
policeman
did
not
arrest
him
and,
so,
he
was
in
trouble.
finally,
a
member
of
congressman
molter's
organization
accommodated
the
appellant
and
made
a
citizen's
arrest,
and
so,
any
statement
by
my
adversary
about
the
district
attorney
being
a
zealous
prosecutor
to
enforce
this
particular
section
and
insinuating
that
because
of
the
association
between
him
and
congressman
molter
he
would
vigorously
prosecuted
the
appellant
his
nonsense.
in
addition
to
which,
when
was
there
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
what
the
--
what
our
office
urged
before
the
three-judge
court
was
that
the
statute
was
valid
against
the
challenge
made
by
the
appellant.
then,
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
the
statute
could
be
narrowed
and,
now,
the
position
of
our
office
was
that
if
you,
the
judges
of
the
three-judge
court,
think
that
the
statute
may
be
overbroad,
then
we
suggest
you
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
under
harrison
against
national
association
of
colored
people
for
the
state
court
to
pass
on
the
statute.
that
was
the
extent
of
our
participation.
now,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
three-judge
court
did
not
pass
on
the
constitution.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
did.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
because
we
urged
the
court
that,
under
the
principle
of
the
annunciated
in
the
dombrowski
case
to
which
i
refer,
under
the
respect
for
the
state
courts,
the
principle
of
federalism
should
be
maintained
in
this
case
and
that
the
appellant
should
be
relegated
to
the
state
courts,
that
there
were
no
special
circumstances
which
justify
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
it's
important
in
the
sense
36
states
have
the
--
have
similar
statutes,
so
has
congress
pass
such
a
statute,
but
it's
not
important
that
we
felt
all
the
while
and
we
feel
today
that
this
was
the
--
this
was
an
action
where
the
appellant
and
his
counsel
simply
decided
they
wanted
a
test
case.
and,
the
reason
they
went
through
the
federal
court
route
was
that
if
they
went
through
the
state
court
route
and
that
they
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
then
it
could
only
get
to
this
court
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
appealing.
and,
if
they
didn't
appeal,
how
could
they
get
a
ruling
by
the
us
supreme
court.
now,
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
pfister
case.
in
the
pfister
case,
the
same
lawyer
started
an
action
in
the
district
court
challenging
the
vagrancy
statutes.
he
had
a
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
he
appealed
to
this
court.
this
court
affirmed.
then,
he
went
back
to
the
state
court,
started
an
action,
and
we
heard
a
lot
from
our
adversary
about
the
length
of
time
it
takes
in
the
state
court.
well,
he
started
an
action
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
--
new
york
county
supreme
court.
he
got
a
decision
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
he
went
directly
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
from
that
and
in
a
space
of
four
months,
he
got
a
decision
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
so
that
the
process
took
four
months.
now,
let's
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
the
criminal
prosecution,
to
which
my
adversary
referred,
took
place
on
december
1,
1965.
he
did
not
start
this
action
in
the
district
court
until
the
later
part
of
april
1966.
so,
he
waited
six
months.
had
he
started
the
action
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
he
would've
had
a
decision
by
april
1966
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
up
to
date
and
there
is
no
delay
in
new
york
state
courts
on
a
motion
for
judgment.
it's
up
to
date.
you
will
notice
it
for
a
particular
day
and,
if
you're
ready
on
that
day,
the
matter
is
argued
and
disposed
of.
so,
the
trial
delay
doesn't
occur,
unless
there
are
questions
of
fact.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
don't
want
any
reflection
on
my
adversary
who
is
a
distinguished
friend
of
mine,
but
i
believe
that
this
is
a
contrived
controversy
in
this
sense
that
the
appellant
deliberately
brought
about
his
arrest
in
order
to
set
up
a
test
case.
and,
when
this
case
went
into
the
criminal
court,
in
the
lower
criminal
court,
the
judge
asked
my
adversary
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case,
he
said
“you
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
there's
no
prima
facie
case,”
and
there
wasn't
a
prima
facie
case
because
all
the
evidence
that
was
there
was
that
one
circular
--
the
complainant
one
circular,
no
--
no
question
of
quantity,
and
mr.
redfield
said,
“no,
i
don't
move
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
i
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.”
and,
when
he
got
up
to
the
appellate
courts,
he
did
the
same
thing,
now,
so
that
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
get
a
decision
in
the
criminal
court
even
though
the
case
was
insufficient
factually
to
challenge
the
statute.
and,
in
that
way,
we
feel
or
we
felt
when
this
case
was
originally
instituted
that
this
was
a
situation
arranged
because
they
feel
that
the
statute
should
be
challenged
and
that
the
--
mr.
zwickler
set
himself
up
as
the
pigeon
for
the
test.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
dombrowski
case,
the
majority
opinion
points
out
that
the
statute
was
vague
and
it's
the
vagueness
that
caused
this
so-called
chill,
but
this
statute
--
there's
no
claim
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
that
the
statute
is
vague.
in
this
case,
the
amicus
brief
is
hard
--
put
to
put
in
a
suggestion
of
vagueness
arising
from
the
use
of
the
word
in
the
statute
in
connection
with
an
election
but
the
election,
of
course,
is
machinery
--
the
election
is
machinery
set
out
in
detail
in
the
election
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
in
the
federal
statute,
instead
of
“in
connection
with,”
they
used
the
words
“relating
to
or
concerning”
which
is
about
the
same
thing.
the
claim
by
the
amicus
that
the
--
that
this
phrase
is
vague
is
untenable
and,
finally,
the
amicus
only,
not
the
appellant,
says
that
the
words
in
quantity
suggest
vagueness
but
the
word
“in
quantity”
as
construed
in
the
very
case
in
the
criminal
court
means
a
substantial
amount,
that
means
not
one
or
two.
it
means
a
substantial
amount.
at
any
rate,
the
appellant
never
tented
that
issue.
now,
judge
roselyn,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
which
you
will
find
very
confusing,
i
believe,
because
he
had
to
extract
portions
of
that
opinion
which
were
contrary
to
the
record
before
him
but,
in
that
opinion,
he
claims
that
the
statute
may
be
overbroad.
overbroad
in
which
way?
overbroad
for
the
reason
that
it
should
be
limited
to
malicious
false
statements
but
we
don't
claim
that
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
say
it
--
if
it's
to
be
construed
that
way,
it
should
be
construed
by
the
state
court.
we
claim
that
the
statute,
as
it
reads,
which
requires
identification
of
person
circulating
literature
as
if
they're
committees,
any
person
who
circulates
literature
in
connection
with
the
campaign
thereby
denominates
himself
a
committee,
whether
it's
one
or
more
than
one,
and
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
state
election
law.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
say
it's
not
necessary
to
construe
the
statute
because
we
say,
on
its
face,
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yeah.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that's
our
position.
now
--
however,
if
constitutional
questions
suggest
themselves,
we
say
that
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
overbroad
and
we
don't
think
its
untenable
intention
should
be
referred
to
the
state
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
justice
white,
i
think,
as
i
read
the
cases,
that's
the
principle
that's
annunciated.
of
course,
you
can
pull
language
out
of
every
case
for
what's
made
to
be
obscure,
but
if
you
read
as
they
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir.
that
in
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
the
case
that
we
have
--
the
issue
was
one
in
which
the
appellant
is
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
--
what
he
alleges
as
a
threatened
criminal
prosecution.
that's
the
case
we
are
dealing
with
now.
the
baggett
case
dealt
with
a
loyalty
owed,
not
a
criminal
prosecution
and,
as
i
read
that
case,
it's
a
question
of
who
you
put
the
burden
of
proof
on.
the
--
the
opinion
in
that
case
said
that
the
federal
court
retain
it
in
that
type
of
situation
unless
special
circumstances
are
set
forth.
but,
in
the
dombrowski
case
which
involved
a
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
the
opinion
very
carefully
says
that
there
were
special
circumstances
in
the
case
which
justified
departure
from
the
rule
of
federalism.
now,
in
--
the
respect
for
the
douglas
against
jeannette
case
--
the
douglas
case
says
there
must
be
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury
both
great
and
immediate;
i'm
pulling
a
phrase
out,
and,
another
phrase,
clear
and
imminent.
and,
we
say
that
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court,
acted
very
properly
in
dismissing
this
complaint
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no
substantial
proof
that
the
danger
to
the
appellant
was
clear
and
imminent
or
that
there
was
great
and
immediate
irreparable
injury.
and,
you
have--
i
think
you
have
very
fine
opinions
both
by
the
chief
judge
of
that
court,
the
eastern
district,
judge
sovath
and
the
circuit
judge
kaufman.
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
dombrowski
case
shows
that
their
conclusion
is
proper
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
today
from
my
adversary
which
justifies
any
challenge
to
the
correctness
of
that
decision
unless
you
start
in
with
the
assumption
that
anyone
who
alleges
that
there
is
a
federal--
that
there
is
a
state
statute
and,
as
a
federal
constitution
of
provision,
the
first
amendment
which
he
alleges
is
being
violated
and
that
gives
him
an
absolute
rights
to
have
the
matter
heard
in
the
federal
court,
but
i
haven't
heard
such
a
rule
annunciated
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
uphold
the
disposition
by
the
district
court,
dismissing
the
complaint
for
the
reasons
which
i've
said
following
douglas
and
dombrowski.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
didn't
hear
that,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
you
have
to
--
the
statute,
as
originally
enacted
in
--
following
the
1940
election
in
new
york,
did
not
go
as
far
as
a
federal
statute.
it
--
it
provided
“the
printer
or
the
person
publishing.”
now,
the
statute
has
been
amended
to
bring
it
in
line
with
the
federal
statute
and
says
“the
printer
and
the
person
publishing,
distributing,
etcetera”
so
that
you
don't
satisfy
the
statute
by
merely
putting
in
the
name
of
the
printer.
the
reason
that
the
statute
couldn't
be
enforced
was
they
were
printing
the
union
label
bug
on
the
literature
in
a
very
obscure
way.
now,
if
you
don't
get
the
number
of
the
--
it's
a
union
label
ally
trait,
counsel
or
whatever
the
name
is,
and
then
it
says,
say,
34
and
if
you
got
the
name
34,
you
know
which
printer
printed
it,
but
if
that
34
was
not
visible,
you
couldn't
know
the
name
of
the
printer
so
it
was
a
useless
thing
and
you
have
the
report
of
the
fair
practices
committee,
which
is
attached
to
our
brief,
which
indicates
the
process
by
which
the
1962
amendment
was
passed
by
the
legislature.
there
was
full
legislative
history
by
a
respectable
source
and
it
was
endorsed
by
all
of
the
political
parties,
by
the
citizens
union,
by
the
association
of
the
bar.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
question
as
to
its
desirability
and
validity.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
of
course,
under
the
fundamental
principles,
if
the
district
court
was
wrong,
and
we
believe
the
contention
that
it
was
wrong
is
not
tenable
then
the
thing
this
court
should
do
is
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
as
it
has
done
in
a
numerable
other
cases,
like
the
reapportionment
cases,
for
it
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
i
say,
it
--
if
the
judge
--
circuit
judge
kaufman
and
judge
sovath
didn't
pass
on
the
merits
at
all,
i
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
would
have
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
--
in
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
under
the
principles
annunciated
in
the
dombrowski
case
and
some
prior
cases,
whether
the
federal
court
should
dismiss
the
complaint
and
relegate
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
is
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
court
would
pass
on
the
--
i
assume,
the
court
would
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that's
number
one.
secondly,
whether
we
would
urge
as
an
alternative,
i
assume
that
if
the
statute
is
criticized
as
being
overly
broad,
the
district
court
should
itself,
and
as
much
as
this
court
would
upheld
that
the
court
should
pass
on
it,
should
itself,
if
it
requires
a
narrowing
to
sustain
the
constitutionality,
narrow
the
statute
there
might
be
other
questions
which
suggest
themselves
as
to
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
justifiable
controversy.
that
--
that
question
was
suggested
before
judge
roselyn
before
he
ordered
the
three-judge
court
and
he
said
he
was
passing
only
on
the
complaint.
and,
the
compliant
says
“i
was
prosecuted.
what
happened?”
and
“i
want
to
do
this,
and
this
prosecutor,
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county,
is
stopping
me
from
doing
that.”
but,
if
you
read
the
statute,
he
says
there's
no
vagueness
in
there
because
he
says
in
there
--
he
says
“i
come.”
he
proclaims,
“i
come
within
the
statute.
i'm
a
violator
of
the
statute
if
i
distribute
this
literature
and
i
want
the
court
to
say
that
i
can
do
it
despite
the
existence
of
that
statute.”
now,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
district
court
may
decide
that,
in
a
contrive
situation
like
that,
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
on
top
of
which
is
the
recent
circulation
of
this
circular
letter
with
the
name
of
the
appellant
on
it
indicating
certainly
that,
under
the
rule
--
the
language
of
the
douglas
case,
there's
certainly
no
clear
and
imminent
danger
that's
involved
in
this
action.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
that's
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
the
statute
--
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but,
before
that,
you
have
the
preliminary
question
of
procedure
it's--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
if
you
eliminate
the
question
of
procedure
and
assume
that
the
appellant
has--
that
there's
a
justifiable
controversy
and
that
he's
entitled
to
relief
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
then,
sure,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
sure,
that's
the
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
that
would
be
the
issue,
and
i'm
not
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
black,
there
this
is
a
question
that
has
been
engaged
in
discussion
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
that
i
have
read
and,
as
i
gather
in
my
humble
way
and
as
the
two
judges
of
the
three-judge
court
concluded,
this
court
has
held
that
it
will
respect
the
principle
of
federalism
in
the
type
of
action
that
we
have
before
us
unless
there
are
special
circumstances
which
dictate
otherwise
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that
would
be
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
but
--
but
you
only
reach
that
if
you
pass
all
the
other
procedural
points.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
and
--
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
--
the
point
at
which
the
appellant
is
trying
to
push
this
court
is
that,
following
dembrowski
which
said
the
special
circumstances,
they're
trying
to
push
this
court
to
say
what
you
have
suggested,
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
should
not
be
any
limitations
at
all,
that
if
you
present
the
matter
to
the
court
showing
a
--
as
you
said,
a
federal
constitution
or
provision
or
state
statute,
a
challenge
on
the
ground
of
the
first
amendment,
that
the
federal
court
should
take
jurisdiction
without
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
i
would
say
no,
there
are
no
state
issues
except
this,
that
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
there's
--
there's
an
elemen
t--
this
is
a
highly
emotional
issue,
the
literature
issued
in
the
campaign
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
election
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
well,
i
--
i
just
wanted
to
suggest
that,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
don't
know
any
election
--
i
don't
know
any
election
that's
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
the
state
courts
may
have
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it's
a
federal
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it's
a
federal
question,
but
the
state
courts
may
have
a
better
awareness
of
the
nuances
because
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
legislative
history
was
developed
in
the
state.
then
the
state
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
nuances
and
the
situation
in
the
community.
if
we
had
a
--
the
congressional
law
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act,
that
would
take
in
the
whole
country.
but,
here,
as
the
report
of
attorney
general
jackson's
grand
jury
said,
the
state
--
the
federal
legislation
would
deal
only
with
national
offices
and
leaving
it
to
the
states
to
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
local
offices,
and
the
states
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
local
situation
like
this
man
planting
himself
in
front
of
congressman
molter's
headquarters
there
and
saying
“please
arrest
me.”
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
may
not
but
the
result,
as
i
understand
it,
in
constitutional
law,
the
result
many
times
is
determined
by
the
background
and
in
the
talley
case,
mr.
justice
black,
which
i
think
you
wrote
the
opinion
you
pointed
out,
that
there
was
no
legislative
history
which
justify
the
particular
identification
requirement
in
the
circulars,
but
i
think
the
states
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
all
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
what?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
talley
case,
i
think
against
california,
was
a
case
in
which
the
city
ordinance
was
enacted
which
forbid
the
distribution
of
any
circulars
or
pamphlets
there
without
any
restriction
of
any
kind
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
anonymous,
yes.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
as
appears
from
the
opinion,
in
this
court,
the
legal
officer
defending
that
ordinance
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
was
enacted
to
prevent
fraud
or
chicanery
and,
in
the
opinion
which
you
wrote,
mr.
justice
black,
you
said
that
there
was
no
legislative
histories
to
support
the
exposition
that
was
made
in
this
court
by
the
legal
representative.
and
we
say,
of
course,
that,
in
this
case,
we
have
ample
legislative
history
both
national
and
federal.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
had
some
hearing
impairment
this
morning.
i
hope
the
court
will
take
that
in
consideration
in
using
the
amplifiers.
thank
you.
the
chief
justice
asked
how
many
states
had
statutes
similar
to
new
york.
according
to
our
brief,
there
are
36
states
having
--
36
states
having
similar
statutes
and,
in
two
states,
the
supreme
court
of
each
of
the
states
of
california
and
pennsylvania
have
upheld
the
statutes
against
first
amendment
challenges.
in
addition,
the
prototype
of
all
of
these
statutes
as
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act,
section
612,
which
was
upheld
there
a
few
years
ago
in
us
against
scott,
a
district
court
case,
involving
literature
circulate
with
respect
to
senator
brady.
the
origin
of
the
statute
goes
back
to
the
1940
election
when
literature
--
anonymous
literature
of
highly
emotional
content
was
circulate
throughout
the
country
as
a
result
of
which
the
then
attorney
general
jackson
appointed
a
special
assistant
and
a
special
grand
jury
as
a
result
and
the
culmination
of
that
was
a
recommendation
which,
among
other
things,
recommended
a
statute
similar
to
the
one
in
new
york
now.
it
said
in
their
report,
“we
recommend
amending
the
corrupt
practices
act
to
prohibit
circulation
through
united
states
mail
of
any
and
all
literature,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
influence
the
election
of
candidates
for
federal
office
or
presidential,
advice
presidential
electors,
or
the
enactment
of
the
feet
of
measures
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
unless
it
is
signed
by
the
person
or
persons
or
committee
or
organization
responsible
for
its
circulation,
together
with
their
addresses.
we
also
suggest
that
all
such
printed
matter
contained
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
person,
persons,
committee,
or
organization
responsible
for
the
printing.”
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
floor
of
congress,
there
was
much
discussion
about
this
recommendation
particularly
by
senator
gillette
on
the
congressional
record
who
has
copious
references
to
the
need
for
the
legislation.
in
19
--
the
original
new
york
statute
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
i
just
wanted
to
give
the
court
--
in
approaching
the
question
whether
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court,
properly
decided
the
question
of
whether
the
appellant
should
be
relegated
to
the
state
court,
i
consider
it
important
to
set
forth
to
this
court
the
nature
of
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with.
now,
this
statute
does
not,
in
any
way,
censor
or
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
any
material
at
all.
it
merely
says,
in
substance,
that
if
you're
going
to
distribute
literature
with
respect
to
any
candidate
or
any
proposition
on
the
ballot,
that
you
must
identify
in
some
way
a
name
or
the
name
of
the
organization.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
discussion
about
my
inline
adversary,
he
used
the
word
which
is
being
preempted,
the
word
“chill”
and
he
said
his
client
was
frozen.
well,
apparently,
he
forgot
his
client
is
not
so
frozen
because,
in
connection
with
a
very
judicial
convention
for
congressman
molter,
which
mr.
justice,
i
think,
brennan
referred
to,
mr.
zwickler
issued
literature
on
the
date
of
august
25,
1967.
and,
he
has
this
name
on
it
and
it
makes
of
course
derogatory
references
to
congressman
molter,
so
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
he
has
his
name
on
it.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
he's
not
prohibiting
the
statute.
no,
he
is
not
acting
in
prohibition
of
the
statute,
but
i
just
wanted
to
address
myself
a
question
he
said
--
my
adversary
said
that
his
client
is
frozen,
that
he
can't
do
anything
and
i'm
saying
he's
not
so
frozen
that
he
can't
issue
this
literature.
now,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint,
following
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
dombrowski
case
that
the
principle
of
federalism
should
be
respected
where
an
injunction
is
sought
against
the
threat
in
criminal
prosecution.
and,
in
the
dombrowski
case,
the
majority
opinion
said
that
there
was
special
circumstances
which
justified
the
departure
from
the
role
of
federalism,
and
the
state
maintains
and
maintained
before
the
district
court
that
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
any
of
these
circumstances
which
justify
the
departure
from
the
respect
for
federalism.
and,
record
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
from
this
respect
for
federalism
which
was
set
forth
not
only
in
dombrowski
case
but
in
many
prior
cases.
they
were
all
--
while
the
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
and
is
--
has
the
authority
by
act
of
congress
to
pass
on
federal
questions,
i
think
the
principle
set
forth
in
douglas
against
the
jeannette
is
that
where
an
injunction
is
sought
against
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
the
plaintiff
would
be
relegated
to
the
state
courts
unless
he
produces
special
circumstances.
in
the
dombrowski
case
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we'd
make
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
the
same
argument
because,
in
essence,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
whether
you
label
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
well
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
whether
you
label
it
an
injunction
or
not,
it
would
be
in
a
nature
of
a
similar
relief
because
he
would
be
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
district
attorney
or
the
law
offices
of
new
york
state
could
not
properly
prosecute
him.
now,
the
--
this,
actually,
is
a
test
case
arranged
by
the
appellant
in
this
case
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
bringing
this
question
before
this
court.
my
adversary
pointed
out
that
what
this
appellant
did
was
not
only
seek
to
circulate
this
anonymous
literature
but,
in
a
very
hot
emotional
political
contest,
he
planted
himself
right
in
front
of
the
democratic
headquarters
of
congressman
molter
and
proceeded
verbally
and
with
the
aid
of
this
literature
to
assail
the
congressman.
in
addition
to
which,
the
arrest
was
not
made
by
a
police
officer.
the
appellant
before
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
club,
went
to
the
police
precinct
to
tell
a
policeman
apparently,
although
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
that
he
was
going
to
do
what
he
subsequently
did
to
make
sure
that
the
policeman
came
there
and
arrested
him
so
he
would
have
the
test
case,
but
the
policeman
did
not
arrest
him
and,
so,
he
was
in
trouble.
finally,
a
member
of
congressman
molter's
organization
accommodated
the
appellant
and
made
a
citizen's
arrest,
and
so,
any
statement
by
my
adversary
about
the
district
attorney
being
a
zealous
prosecutor
to
enforce
this
particular
section
and
insinuating
that
because
of
the
association
between
him
and
congressman
molter
he
would
vigorously
prosecuted
the
appellant
his
nonsense.
in
addition
to
which,
when
was
there
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
what
the
--
what
our
office
urged
before
the
three-judge
court
was
that
the
statute
was
valid
against
the
challenge
made
by
the
appellant.
then,
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
the
statute
could
be
narrowed
and,
now,
the
position
of
our
office
was
that
if
you,
the
judges
of
the
three-judge
court,
think
that
the
statute
may
be
overbroad,
then
we
suggest
you
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
under
harrison
against
national
association
of
colored
people
for
the
state
court
to
pass
on
the
statute.
that
was
the
extent
of
our
participation.
now,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
three-judge
court
did
not
pass
on
the
constitution.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
did.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
because
we
urged
the
court
that,
under
the
principle
of
the
annunciated
in
the
dombrowski
case
to
which
i
refer,
under
the
respect
for
the
state
courts,
the
principle
of
federalism
should
be
maintained
in
this
case
and
that
the
appellant
should
be
relegated
to
the
state
courts,
that
there
were
no
special
circumstances
which
justify
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
it's
important
in
the
sense
36
states
have
the
--
have
similar
statutes,
so
has
congress
pass
such
a
statute,
but
it's
not
important
that
we
felt
all
the
while
and
we
feel
today
that
this
was
the
--
this
was
an
action
where
the
appellant
and
his
counsel
simply
decided
they
wanted
a
test
case.
and,
the
reason
they
went
through
the
federal
court
route
was
that
if
they
went
through
the
state
court
route
and
that
they
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
then
it
could
only
get
to
this
court
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
appealing.
and,
if
they
didn't
appeal,
how
could
they
get
a
ruling
by
the
us
supreme
court.
now,
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
pfister
case.
in
the
pfister
case,
the
same
lawyer
started
an
action
in
the
district
court
challenging
the
vagrancy
statutes.
he
had
a
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
he
appealed
to
this
court.
this
court
affirmed.
then,
he
went
back
to
the
state
court,
started
an
action,
and
we
heard
a
lot
from
our
adversary
about
the
length
of
time
it
takes
in
the
state
court.
well,
he
started
an
action
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
--
new
york
county
supreme
court.
he
got
a
decision
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
he
went
directly
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
from
that
and
in
a
space
of
four
months,
he
got
a
decision
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
so
that
the
process
took
four
months.
now,
let's
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
the
criminal
prosecution,
to
which
my
adversary
referred,
took
place
on
december
1,
1965.
he
did
not
start
this
action
in
the
district
court
until
the
later
part
of
april
1966.
so,
he
waited
six
months.
had
he
started
the
action
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
he
would've
had
a
decision
by
april
1966
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
up
to
date
and
there
is
no
delay
in
new
york
state
courts
on
a
motion
for
judgment.
it's
up
to
date.
you
will
notice
it
for
a
particular
day
and,
if
you're
ready
on
that
day,
the
matter
is
argued
and
disposed
of.
so,
the
trial
delay
doesn't
occur,
unless
there
are
questions
of
fact.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
don't
want
any
reflection
on
my
adversary
who
is
a
distinguished
friend
of
mine,
but
i
believe
that
this
is
a
contrived
controversy
in
this
sense
that
the
appellant
deliberately
brought
about
his
arrest
in
order
to
set
up
a
test
case.
and,
when
this
case
went
into
the
criminal
court,
in
the
lower
criminal
court,
the
judge
asked
my
adversary
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case,
he
said
“you
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
there's
no
prima
facie
case,”
and
there
wasn't
a
prima
facie
case
because
all
the
evidence
that
was
there
was
that
one
circular
--
the
complainant
one
circular,
no
--
no
question
of
quantity,
and
mr.
redfield
said,
“no,
i
don't
move
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
i
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.”
and,
when
he
got
up
to
the
appellate
courts,
he
did
the
same
thing,
now,
so
that
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
get
a
decision
in
the
criminal
court
even
though
the
case
was
insufficient
factually
to
challenge
the
statute.
and,
in
that
way,
we
feel
or
we
felt
when
this
case
was
originally
instituted
that
this
was
a
situation
arranged
because
they
feel
that
the
statute
should
be
challenged
and
that
the
--
mr.
zwickler
set
himself
up
as
the
pigeon
for
the
test.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
dombrowski
case,
the
majority
opinion
points
out
that
the
statute
was
vague
and
it's
the
vagueness
that
caused
this
so-called
chill,
but
this
statute
--
there's
no
claim
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
that
the
statute
is
vague.
in
this
case,
the
amicus
brief
is
hard
--
put
to
put
in
a
suggestion
of
vagueness
arising
from
the
use
of
the
word
in
the
statute
in
connection
with
an
election
but
the
election,
of
course,
is
machinery
--
the
election
is
machinery
set
out
in
detail
in
the
election
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
in
the
federal
statute,
instead
of
“in
connection
with,”
they
used
the
words
“relating
to
or
concerning”
which
is
about
the
same
thing.
the
claim
by
the
amicus
that
the
--
that
this
phrase
is
vague
is
untenable
and,
finally,
the
amicus
only,
not
the
appellant,
says
that
the
words
in
quantity
suggest
vagueness
but
the
word
“in
quantity”
as
construed
in
the
very
case
in
the
criminal
court
means
a
substantial
amount,
that
means
not
one
or
two.
it
means
a
substantial
amount.
at
any
rate,
the
appellant
never
tented
that
issue.
now,
judge
roselyn,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
which
you
will
find
very
confusing,
i
believe,
because
he
had
to
extract
portions
of
that
opinion
which
were
contrary
to
the
record
before
him
but,
in
that
opinion,
he
claims
that
the
statute
may
be
overbroad.
overbroad
in
which
way?
overbroad
for
the
reason
that
it
should
be
limited
to
malicious
false
statements
but
we
don't
claim
that
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
say
it
--
if
it's
to
be
construed
that
way,
it
should
be
construed
by
the
state
court.
we
claim
that
the
statute,
as
it
reads,
which
requires
identification
of
person
circulating
literature
as
if
they're
committees,
any
person
who
circulates
literature
in
connection
with
the
campaign
thereby
denominates
himself
a
committee,
whether
it's
one
or
more
than
one,
and
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
state
election
law.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
say
it's
not
necessary
to
construe
the
statute
because
we
say,
on
its
face,
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yeah.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that's
our
position.
now
--
however,
if
constitutional
questions
suggest
themselves,
we
say
that
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
overbroad
and
we
don't
think
its
untenable
intention
should
be
referred
to
the
state
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
justice
white,
i
think,
as
i
read
the
cases,
that's
the
principle
that's
annunciated.
of
course,
you
can
pull
language
out
of
every
case
for
what's
made
to
be
obscure,
but
if
you
read
as
they
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir.
that
in
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
the
case
that
we
have
--
the
issue
was
one
in
which
the
appellant
is
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
--
what
he
alleges
as
a
threatened
criminal
prosecution.
that's
the
case
we
are
dealing
with
now.
the
baggett
case
dealt
with
a
loyalty
owed,
not
a
criminal
prosecution
and,
as
i
read
that
case,
it's
a
question
of
who
you
put
the
burden
of
proof
on.
the
--
the
opinion
in
that
case
said
that
the
federal
court
retain
it
in
that
type
of
situation
unless
special
circumstances
are
set
forth.
but,
in
the
dombrowski
case
which
involved
a
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
the
opinion
very
carefully
says
that
there
were
special
circumstances
in
the
case
which
justified
departure
from
the
rule
of
federalism.
now,
in
--
the
respect
for
the
douglas
against
jeannette
case
--
the
douglas
case
says
there
must
be
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury
both
great
and
immediate;
i'm
pulling
a
phrase
out,
and,
another
phrase,
clear
and
imminent.
and,
we
say
that
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court,
acted
very
properly
in
dismissing
this
complaint
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no
substantial
proof
that
the
danger
to
the
appellant
was
clear
and
imminent
or
that
there
was
great
and
immediate
irreparable
injury.
and,
you
have--
i
think
you
have
very
fine
opinions
both
by
the
chief
judge
of
that
court,
the
eastern
district,
judge
sovath
and
the
circuit
judge
kaufman.
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
dombrowski
case
shows
that
their
conclusion
is
proper
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
today
from
my
adversary
which
justifies
any
challenge
to
the
correctness
of
that
decision
unless
you
start
in
with
the
assumption
that
anyone
who
alleges
that
there
is
a
federal--
that
there
is
a
state
statute
and,
as
a
federal
constitution
of
provision,
the
first
amendment
which
he
alleges
is
being
violated
and
that
gives
him
an
absolute
rights
to
have
the
matter
heard
in
the
federal
court,
but
i
haven't
heard
such
a
rule
annunciated
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
uphold
the
disposition
by
the
district
court,
dismissing
the
complaint
for
the
reasons
which
i've
said
following
douglas
and
dombrowski.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
didn't
hear
that,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
you
have
to
--
the
statute,
as
originally
enacted
in
--
following
the
1940
election
in
new
york,
did
not
go
as
far
as
a
federal
statute.
it
--
it
provided
“the
printer
or
the
person
publishing.”
now,
the
statute
has
been
amended
to
bring
it
in
line
with
the
federal
statute
and
says
“the
printer
and
the
person
publishing,
distributing,
etcetera”
so
that
you
don't
satisfy
the
statute
by
merely
putting
in
the
name
of
the
printer.
the
reason
that
the
statute
couldn't
be
enforced
was
they
were
printing
the
union
label
bug
on
the
literature
in
a
very
obscure
way.
now,
if
you
don't
get
the
number
of
the
--
it's
a
union
label
ally
trait,
counsel
or
whatever
the
name
is,
and
then
it
says,
say,
34
and
if
you
got
the
name
34,
you
know
which
printer
printed
it,
but
if
that
34
was
not
visible,
you
couldn't
know
the
name
of
the
printer
so
it
was
a
useless
thing
and
you
have
the
report
of
the
fair
practices
committee,
which
is
attached
to
our
brief,
which
indicates
the
process
by
which
the
1962
amendment
was
passed
by
the
legislature.
there
was
full
legislative
history
by
a
respectable
source
and
it
was
endorsed
by
all
of
the
political
parties,
by
the
citizens
union,
by
the
association
of
the
bar.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
question
as
to
its
desirability
and
validity.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
of
course,
under
the
fundamental
principles,
if
the
district
court
was
wrong,
and
we
believe
the
contention
that
it
was
wrong
is
not
tenable
then
the
thing
this
court
should
do
is
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
as
it
has
done
in
a
numerable
other
cases,
like
the
reapportionment
cases,
for
it
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
i
say,
it
--
if
the
judge
--
circuit
judge
kaufman
and
judge
sovath
didn't
pass
on
the
merits
at
all,
i
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
would
have
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
--
in
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
threatened
criminal
prosecution,
under
the
principles
annunciated
in
the
dombrowski
case
and
some
prior
cases,
whether
the
federal
court
should
dismiss
the
complaint
and
relegate
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
is
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
court
would
pass
on
the
--
i
assume,
the
court
would
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that's
number
one.
secondly,
whether
we
would
urge
as
an
alternative,
i
assume
that
if
the
statute
is
criticized
as
being
overly
broad,
the
district
court
should
itself,
and
as
much
as
this
court
would
upheld
that
the
court
should
pass
on
it,
should
itself,
if
it
requires
a
narrowing
to
sustain
the
constitutionality,
narrow
the
statute
there
might
be
other
questions
which
suggest
themselves
as
to
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
justifiable
controversy.
that
--
that
question
was
suggested
before
judge
roselyn
before
he
ordered
the
three-judge
court
and
he
said
he
was
passing
only
on
the
complaint.
and,
the
compliant
says
“i
was
prosecuted.
what
happened?”
and
“i
want
to
do
this,
and
this
prosecutor,
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county,
is
stopping
me
from
doing
that.”
but,
if
you
read
the
statute,
he
says
there's
no
vagueness
in
there
because
he
says
in
there
--
he
says
“i
come.”
he
proclaims,
“i
come
within
the
statute.
i'm
a
violator
of
the
statute
if
i
distribute
this
literature
and
i
want
the
court
to
say
that
i
can
do
it
despite
the
existence
of
that
statute.”
now,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
district
court
may
decide
that,
in
a
contrive
situation
like
that,
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
on
top
of
which
is
the
recent
circulation
of
this
circular
letter
with
the
name
of
the
appellant
on
it
indicating
certainly
that,
under
the
rule
--
the
language
of
the
douglas
case,
there's
certainly
no
clear
and
imminent
danger
that's
involved
in
this
action.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
that's
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
the
statute
--
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but,
before
that,
you
have
the
preliminary
question
of
procedure
it's--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
if
you
eliminate
the
question
of
procedure
and
assume
that
the
appellant
has--
that
there's
a
justifiable
controversy
and
that
he's
entitled
to
relief
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
then,
sure,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
sure,
that's
the
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
that
would
be
the
issue,
and
i'm
not
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
black,
there
this
is
a
question
that
has
been
engaged
in
discussion
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
that
i
have
read
and,
as
i
gather
in
my
humble
way
and
as
the
two
judges
of
the
three-judge
court
concluded,
this
court
has
held
that
it
will
respect
the
principle
of
federalism
in
the
type
of
action
that
we
have
before
us
unless
there
are
special
circumstances
which
dictate
otherwise
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that
would
be
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
but
--
but
you
only
reach
that
if
you
pass
all
the
other
procedural
points.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
and
--
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
--
the
point
at
which
the
appellant
is
trying
to
push
this
court
is
that,
following
dembrowski
which
said
the
special
circumstances,
they're
trying
to
push
this
court
to
say
what
you
have
suggested,
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
should
not
be
any
limitations
at
all,
that
if
you
present
the
matter
to
the
court
showing
a
--
as
you
said,
a
federal
constitution
or
provision
or
state
statute,
a
challenge
on
the
ground
of
the
first
amendment,
that
the
federal
court
should
take
jurisdiction
without
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
i
would
say
no,
there
are
no
state
issues
except
this,
that
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
there's
--
there's
an
elemen
t--
this
is
a
highly
emotional
issue,
the
literature
issued
in
the
campaign
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
election
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
well,
i
--
i
just
wanted
to
suggest
that,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
don't
know
any
election
--
i
don't
know
any
election
that's
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
the
state
courts
may
have
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it's
a
federal
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it's
a
federal
question,
but
the
state
courts
may
have
a
better
awareness
of
the
nuances
because
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
legislative
history
was
developed
in
the
state.
then
the
state
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
nuances
and
the
situation
in
the
community.
if
we
had
a
--
the
congressional
law
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act,
that
would
take
in
the
whole
country.
but,
here,
as
the
report
of
attorney
general
jackson's
grand
jury
said,
the
state
--
the
federal
legislation
would
deal
only
with
national
offices
and
leaving
it
to
the
states
to
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
local
offices,
and
the
states
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
local
situation
like
this
man
planting
himself
in
front
of
congressman
molter's
headquarters
there
and
saying
“please
arrest
me.”
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
may
not
but
the
result,
as
i
understand
it,
in
constitutional
law,
the
result
many
times
is
determined
by
the
background
and
in
the
talley
case,
mr.
justice
black,
which
i
think
you
wrote
the
opinion
you
pointed
out,
that
there
was
no
legislative
history
which
justify
the
particular
identification
requirement
in
the
circulars,
but
i
think
the
states
would
have
a
better
appreciation
of
all
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
what?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
talley
case,
i
think
against
california,
was
a
case
in
which
the
city
ordinance
was
enacted
which
forbid
the
distribution
of
any
circulars
or
pamphlets
there
without
any
restriction
of
any
kind
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
anonymous,
yes.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
as
appears
from
the
opinion,
in
this
court,
the
legal
officer
defending
that
ordinance
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
was
enacted
to
prevent
fraud
or
chicanery
and,
in
the
opinion
which
you
wrote,
mr.
justice
black,
you
said
that
there
was
no
legislative
histories
to
support
the
exposition
that
was
made
in
this
court
by
the
legal
representative.
and
we
say,
of
course,
that,
in
this
case,
we
have
ample
legislative
history
both
national
and
federal.
