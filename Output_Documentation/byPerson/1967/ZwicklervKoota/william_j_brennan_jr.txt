did
you
say
a
matter
of
prudence?
justice
william
j.

i
thought
your
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
this
is
a
federal
question
clearly
in
line
for--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
federal
courts
to
decide
in
which
congress
has
indicated
the
intended
federal
courts
to
decide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
--
well,
that's
not
prudence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
running
for
judgeship
now,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
there
some
way
the
statute
can
be
construed
to
be
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
if
there
was
to
be
abstention,
why
shouldn't
the
--
only
the
state
question
be
reverted
to
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
shouldn't
or
--
why
shouldn't
that
--
why
should
the
federal
court
dismiss
the
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
get
this.
you
mean
that
you're
asking
not
really,
as
you
say,
the
three-judge
court
erred
in
abstaining
but,
instead,
that
we
take
and
decide
what
this
three-judge
court
refused
to
decide.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
the
only
issue
you
brought
up,
but
the
only
judgment
we
have
before
us
is
a
dismissal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
--
how
can
we
do
more
than
this
if
we
agree
with
you?
you
think
that
the
three-judge
court
was
wrong
in
dismissal,
how
can
we
draw
the
lines
except
reverse
the
dismissal?
then,
you
go
back
to
the
three-judge
court
on
merit
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
earlier
that
sometimes
it's
quite
faint
to
litigating.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
if
he
has
his
name
on
it,
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
can't
--
he
can't
get
involved
with
the
statute,
can
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
not
--
he
did
not
sign
it?
