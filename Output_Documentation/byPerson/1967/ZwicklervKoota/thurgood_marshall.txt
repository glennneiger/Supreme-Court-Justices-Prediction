marshall
mr.
redfield,
who
could
better
determine
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
or
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
say
that
the
government's
opinion
that
you
could
do
just
as
well
in
the
state
courts
with
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
decide
that
you
can
get
a
faster
remedy
in
the
federal
court
than
you
can
get
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
take
it,
you
misunderstood
me.
i
would
assume
that
this
court
would
ultimately
pass
on
in
any
of
them
unless
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
put
on
the
--
violated
the
new
york
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
either,
but
i
need
never
to
be
the
only
one
to
agree
with
the
court,
wouldn't
i?
my
only
point
is,
why
not
use
a
new
york
court
as
the
original
court
of
original
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hirshowitz,
did
you
in
the
three-judge
court
urged
abstention?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
no
objection
to
the
three-judge
court
passing
on
the
constitutionality,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
did
the
attorney
general's
office
have
any
objection
to
this
three-judge
court
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
time?

this
is
an
important

the
statute
raised
