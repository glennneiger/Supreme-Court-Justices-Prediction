justice

is
there
any
issue
here
of
any
kind
except
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
when
the
--
if
the
case
should
be
put
to
trial?
is
that
all?
in
other
words,
suppose
the
case
is
put
to
trial,
what
is
at
issue,
just
one
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
issue
would
they
have
to
pass
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
question
is
basic,
is
the
act
constitutional,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basic
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
it
is
not
your
basic
issue
whether
this
statute
is
constitutional
that
holds
that
a
man
could
be
convicted
of
a
crime
for
distributing
anonymous
information
in
an
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
forget
procedure
for
a
moment.
isn't
that
all
there
is
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basic
issue
in
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
there
be
effort
made
by
procedural
devices
or
anything
else
to
prevent
the
trial
of
that
issue
so
that
that
issue
could
be
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
real
basic
question
here
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
federal
constitution
of
this
act.
that's
right,
isn't
it?

might
be
many
cases
where
there
are
many
state
procedures.
it
would
be
wise
to
have
--
not
procedures
but,
state
questions,
it
better
be
wise
to
have
the
court
stand
on
it
and
send
it
to
the
state
court.

of
