mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
other
side
of
the
coin
in
the
case
which
was
just
heard
by
this
court,
namely
--
i
have
a
petitioner
before
this
court
who
was
a
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child,
whose
child
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
louisiana.
the
mother
was
a
domiciliary
of
texas,
however.
her
son
at
the
age
of
19
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
louisiana.
there
is
no
question
that
had
the
accident
occurred
in
texas
and
had
the
petitioner
been
able
to
sue
in
texas,
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover
under
the
texas
wrongful
death
statute
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
brought
into
this
world
an
illegitimate
child.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
this
was
a
minor
son.
he
was
19
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
death.
he
was
a
war
baby.
she
was
not
married
at
the
time
of
conception
nor
at
the
time
of
birth.
the
nature
of
the
case
surrounds
itself
with
the
civil
code
of
louisiana
as
it
relates
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
submit
that
the
civil
code
itself
contains
equal
protection
theories
especially
in
article
xxi
where
the
courts
are
directed
to
decide
cases
according
to
natural
reason
law,
natural
reason
and
equity
where
there
is
no
precise
law
on
the
subject.
in
this
particular
instance,
2315
must
be
considered
as
the
tort
doctrine
of
louisiana
and
it
is
solely
the
tort
doctrine
of
louisiana.
the
article
itself
says,
“every
act
whatever
of
men
which
causes
damage
to
another
obliges
him
by
his
fault
that
occurred
to
repair
it.”
the
statute
then
continues
with
verbiage
to
grant
the
right
to
recover
from
wrongful
death
to
allow
it
to
survive
and
to
grant
this
right
to
“children”,
“mothers
or
fathers”,
“brothers
or
sisters”.
this
is
the
terminology
that
is
used.it
has
been
argued
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
matter
that
article
3556,
“section
8”,
which
is
the
definitional
article
in
the
civil
code,
defines
children
as
being
only
legitimate
children.
children
when
used
around
the
code,
unless
otherwise,
used
refer
to
legitimate
children.
it
does
not
include
illegitimate
children
who
are
acknowledged
and
it
does
not
include
ordinarily
what
would
otherwise
be
termed
bastards.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
justice,
if
she
had
legitimated
the
child,
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover.
how
--
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover.
however,
she
only
acknowledged
the
child.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
if
she
only
acknowledged
the
child,
she
could
not
recover
under
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
legitimation
is
accomplished
by
notarial
act.
but
legitimation
can
only
occur
where
the
child
could
have
been
born
of
a
valid
marriage
if
the
mother
and
the
father
then
could
have
legally
concepted.
for
example,
in
adulterous
child,
the
product
of
an
adulterous
union
could
not
be
legitimated;
it
could
not
be
effectively
acknowledged.
but
in
under
any
–-
mr.
william
f.
wessel
by
adoption,
the
article
2315
specifically
allows
recovery
in
instances
of
a
doctrine.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
could
have
adopted
this
child.
there's
no
question.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
however,
there
was
no
need
for
mrs.
glona
to
adopt
this
child.
there
was
no
need
for
mrs.
glona
to
acknowledge
this
child.
there
is
no
need
for
mrs.
galona
to
legitimate
this
child
because
she
cannot
be
--
it
cannot
be
construed
that
she
took
into
account
louisiana
law
when
she
had
her
premarital
intercourse.
even
under
the
fiction
that
you
understand
the
law
of
the
locale
in
which
you
live,
which
louisiana
indulges
in,
mrs.
glona
at
the
time
of
conception
and
the
time
of
birth
was
a
texas
domiciliary
as
she
could
not
have
adverted
to
louisiana
law
in
this
matter
to
determine
what
she
should
have
done.
it
was
only
after
the
child
was
born
and
raised
to
a
great
degree
that
he
moved
to
louisiana
and
there
is
where
he
was
killed.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
justice,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
state
has
never
given
a
reason.
the
only
reason
that
the
state
has
given
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
the
court
can
imagine
one
if
the
classification
itself
is
not
inherently
suspect.
those
are
only
what
i
would
term
--
as
i
have
termed
in
my
brief
the
functional
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
f.
wessel
what
makes
this
case
inherently
suspect
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
is
the
fact
of
illegitimacy,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
mother
could
have
helped
that
but
she
did
not;
she
did
not.
but
the
classification
itself
is
there.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
there's
no
question
about
that,
she
is.
i
submit
only
that
she
did
not
in
this
particular
case.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
view
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
brings
this
action
for
wrongful
death,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
this
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
out
where
the
child
died.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
brings
this
on
her
own
right,
lost
of
affection,
support
and
love.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
child
must
bring
the
action.
if
he's
a
minor,
the
two
of
them
must
be
appointed
by
the
court.
and
she
could
be
appointed
too
but
she
would
not
be
the
natural
--
she
would
not
be
automatically
(voice
overlap)
appointed.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
child
could
recover
for
his
personal
injuries.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
he
could
still
but
if
he
were
living.
but
if
he
is
dead,
he
cannot.
he
cannot.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
mr.
justice,
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
texas
provides
--
gives
to
the
mothers
of
illegitimate
and
illegitimate
the
same
rights
as
if
the
child
were
legitimate.
and
this
comes
back
to
an
early
case,
i
believe
in
1908,
galveston
v.
walker
where
the
--
it
was
the
court
imposed
this
rule
because
louisiana
seems
to
take
the
approach
of
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
illegitimate
children
were
not
mentioned
in
2350.
it
negates,
it
fails
to
look
at
the
statute
in
terms
of
its
broad
compensatory
purposes.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
lord
campbell's
act
was
first
passed
in
1846.
louisiana,
failing
to
follow
the
french
law,
did
not
under
its
general
tort
law
which
is
comprised
in
2350,
did
not
give
a
right
for
wrongful
death
until
1855
which
by
statute
it
first
enacted
its
wrongful
death
statute
presumably
to
compensate,
to
give
a
general
right
where
no
general
right
existed
before
and
i
submit
that
where
a
state
purports
to
give
a
general
right
to
its
population
if
it
classifies
by
its
application
as
has
been
done
by
the
louisiana
courts,
if
it
classifies
or
fences
out
of
that
general
right
a
certain
portion
of
the
population,
it
then
must
show
the
purpose
and
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
classification
that
is
made.
i
submit
that
the
argument
made
by
the
respondents
or
the
appellees
in
the
levy
case
here
today
that
2315
is
an
inheritance
statute
is
incorrect.
it
is
not
related
to
the
forced
heirship
laws
of
louisiana.
it
is
the
tort
law
of
louisiana.
a
tort
law
providing
a
general
remedy,
a
general
relief
and
it
is
not
the
inheritance
law
and
it
therefore
does
not
pertain
to
family
life.
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
still
apply
to
family
life
or
family
status.
loving
versus
virginia
certainly
affected
the
family
situation
as
well
as
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
and
certainly,
the
griffin
case
affected
family
life
and
family
status.
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
certainly
applies
in
this
instance
and
it
applies
under
a
two-fold
approach.
it
applies
either
that
there
is
an
intrinsic
classification,
an
intrinsic
suspect
classification,
a
constitutional
irrelevance
as
we
said
in
edwards
versus
california
where
status
is
the
sole
reason
for
the
classification.
if
as
we
said
in
mclaughlin,
if
as
we
said
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
loving
versus
virginia,
the
classification
itself
is
arbitrarily
set
up,
then
the
state
has
an
overriding
burden
of
justifying
that
classification.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
griffin.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i'm
sorry.
i'm
thinking
about
connecticut
birth
control
case.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
griswold.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
the
inherently
suspect
classification
test
applies
here.certainly
in
yick
wo,
we
had
a
chinese
man,
a
laundry
man
who
could
not
operate
his
laundry
and
there,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
court
had
held
that
classification
to
be
intrinsically
suspect.
under
mclaughlin,
we
had
the
race
test
because
in
florida
it
was
the
crime
for
whites
and
negroes
to
have
premarital
intercourse
but
not
for
whites
and
whites
and
negroes
and
negroes.
and
certainly
in
the
miscegenation
case
in
loving
versus
virginia,
we
have
the
intrinsic
classification
again.
we
have
it
again
in
hirabayashi,
we
have
it
in
oyama
which
is
an
inheritance,
which
was
an
inheritance
situation
where
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that
they're
race
cases.
well,
we
have
carrington
versus
rash
which
was
servicemen
and
we
have
in
hernandez
which
is
mexican.
nationality
rather
than
race,
i
would
suppose.
i
don't
know
how
we
would
classify
this.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
and
she
did
not.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
did
not
do
that
because
she
did
not
--
i
submit
she
did
not
have
to
contemplate
louisiana
law.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
did
not
have
to
do
anything,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
could
she
have
gone
through
an
act
of
legitimation?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
could
have
adopted
in
texas.
she
did
not
have
to
do
either
in
order
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes.
this
case
was
brought
in
diversity
in
the
federal
district
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no
barrier.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
what
i
said
mr.
justice.
that
is
correct.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that
texas
would
have
that.
louisiana
has
it
peculiarly
because
it
affects
the
right
of
inheritance
in
this
intense
situation.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
the
texas
has
it.
i
can't
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
certainly,
i
believe
that
they
could
have.
yes,
i
think
that
texas
certainly
has
adoption
laws.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
main
contention,
of
course,
is
that
the
classification
is
automatically
suspect
and
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
must
be
undertaken
by
the
state
or
the
defendants
in
this
case
not
by
the
plaintiff
herself.
the
other
approach
to
equal
protection
which
i
would
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
illegitimate
children
may
inherit
from
their
mothers
and
mothers
of
illegitimates
may
inherit
from
the
illegitimate
in
texas.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
as
to
the
father,
however,
i
have
cited
the
26
brooklyn
law
review
which
is
as
far
as
inheritance
goes
in
1959
article
in
my
brief
at
page
18
which
does
set
out
every
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
as
of
1959
and
points
out
the
inheritable
rights
vis-à-vis
mother
vis-à-vis
the
child's
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
am
virtually
certain
that
they
can
if
--
in
some
jurisdictions.
in
my
research
in
this
matter,
i
went
through
every
state
and
in
my
brief
i
pointed
out
the
results
of
my
research
as
to
the
mother
vis-à-vis
the
child
but
not
the
father.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
will,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
will,
mr.
justice.
i
will
research
that
and
i
will
furnish
that
to
the
court.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
think
that
this
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
proof.
i
think
illegitimacy
is
an
irrelevant
--
is
irrelevant
under
the
constitution.
the
fact
of
illegitimacy
is
irrelevant.
i
submit
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it's
absolutely
irrelevant.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
my
contention
as
far
as
where
a
general
right
is
concerned.
i
distinguish
this
case
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
that
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
submit
that
it
is
irrelevant.
i
think
that
the
--
what
is
relevant
is
the
question
of
proof
in
those
proceedings
but
certainly
not
the
question
of
status.
i
submit
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
approach
to
equal
protection
which
this
court
has
taken
is
what
i
term
the
functional
approach.
that
is
to
say
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
classification
made
and
whether
or
not
it
can
be
justified.
i
think
that
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
gone
--
have
overlapped
as
far
as
the
constitutional
irrelevance
or
inherently
suspect
classification
test
is
concerned
and
the
functional
approach
as
was
done
in
mclaughlin,
i
believe,
which
said
that
it
always
classifies
on
the
basis
of
race
because
the
heavy
burden
of
justification,
it
will
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
necessary
and
not
merely
rationally
related
to
the
state
purpose.
now,
under
the
functional
approach
which
i
think
mr.
justice
jackson
set
out
in
--
quite
clearly
and
railway
express
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
where
the
equal
protection
seizes
to
apply
equality
or
to
give
protection
where
the
purpose
of
the
statute
does
not
relate
or
the
purpose
or
the
classification
made
does
not
relate
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
for
example,
in
smith
v.
cahoon,
the
state
of
florida
required
that
all
negligent,
all
operators
of
motor
carriers
on
the
highways
have
furnished
financial
responsibility.
but
it
accepted
out,
it
fenced
out
of
that
application
those
carriers
of
produced
and
those
carriers
of
foreign
goods.
in
that
case,
under
the
functional
approach
and
i
think
it
points
it
out
very
adequately
the
purpose
of
the
statute
obviously
was
to
protect
the
general
motoring
public.
the
classification
made
did
not
achieve
that
purpose
and
that
is
an
economic
interest
and
that
this
case
can
afford
--
if
this
is
considered
to
be
a
property
right,
then
certainly
in
this
case,
we
have
the
same
idea
as
to
purpose
of
classification.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i'm
saying
if
the
classification
made
had
relates
to
the
purpose
of
the
act,
then
the
classification
can't
be
made.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
louisiana
can
require
all
illegitimate
--
all
mothers
of
illegitimates
to
legitimate
its
children
under
penalty
of
some
law
and
their
failure
to
do
so
would
deny
them
certain
rights.
yes,
i
believe
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
not
in
a
wrongful
death
statute,
mr.
justice.
a
wrongful
death
statute
has
as
its
purpose
not
set
up
rules
for
illegitimates
but
has
as
its
purpose
fundamentally
even
in
lord
campbell's
act
in
1846
to
compensate
individuals
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
its
wrongful
death
statute
could
conceivably
have
a
dual
purpose.
it
could
conceivably
yes
and
a
classification
could
be
made
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
then
i'd
say
it
relates
back
that
this
sort
of
classification
cannot
be
made.
under
this
sort
of
an
approach
where
the
classification
--
if
the
classification
made
is
not
inherently
suspect
before
by
reason
of
its
--
the
classification
that's
made.
the
status,
as
i
interpret
this,
then
if
that
classification
cannot
be
made,
it
can
never
be
made.
no
classification
can
be
made
as
to
negroes
in
most
instances
except
perhaps,
may
be
in
registering
births.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
it's
not.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
characteristically,
the
wrongful
death
issue.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
well,
in
november
of
last
year,
the
three-judge
court,
which
this
court
has
granted
in
smith
versus
king
which
decided
the
american
jewish
congress
amicus
brief.
it
points
out
the
decision
there
that
where
a
state
has
given
something
like
aid
to
dependent
children,
it
cannot
take
away
that
aid.
they
considered
that
the
three-judge
court,
federal
court,
considered
that
to
be
a
general
right
which
i
think
is
analogous
to
this
situation.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
solely
on
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
louisiana
as
the
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana
had
interpreted
the
wrongful
death
statute
and
it
relied
also
in
morey
v.
doud.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
per
curiam
decision
was
relied
solely.
the
only
case
cited
was
morey
v.
doud,
which
was
a
case
on
equal
protection
in
which
the
court
had
held
--
the
supreme
court
had
held
that
the
classification
there
in
an
economic
matter
was
held
to
be
unreasonable
and
that
related
to
the
american
express
company.
the
state
of
illinois
had
required
all
banking
institutions
or
those
issuing
money
orders
to,
in
that
instance,
to
register
with
the
illinois
security
exchange
commission.
but
it
excluded
out
of
that
classification.
it
fenced
out
of
that
classification
the
american
express
company
because
it
was
a
national
concern
and
morey
versus
doud
decided
by
this
court
held
that
such
a
classification
did
not
meet
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
since
it
did
not
meet
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
failed
under
the
functional
approach
to
equal
protection.
and
i
failed
to
see
and
i
think
looked
at
it
how
the
equal
protection
clause
--
how
the
fencing
out
of
illegitimates,
illegitimate
families,
mothers,
fathers
or
children,
under
the
use
of
2315,
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
louisiana
can
that
classification
can
be
made
in
view
of
the
obvious
purpose
of
that
wrongful
death
statute.
louisiana
courts
allow
employers
to
recover
for
the
wrongful
death
children,
for
the
wrongful
death
of
an
employee
but
will
not
allow
that
employee's
illegitimate
children
to
recover
for
his
wrongful
death
in
effect
and
that
case
is
also
cited
in
the
brief
of
counsel
in
thomas
v.
matthews
lumber
company
by
reason
of
workmen's
compensation
aspect
to
the
case.
louisiana
also
has
a
peculiar
rule
as
to
illegitimates.
it
presumes
that
every
child
born
of
a
mother,
born
of
a
woman
who
is
married
is
legitimate,
regardless
of
whether
that
woman
is
living
with
her
husband,
regardless
of
whether
he
has
access.
i'm
representing
in
the
state
of
louisiana
today
a
woman
for
the
wrongful
death
of
her
child
and
she,
this
child
was
two
years
old
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted
and
she
have
not
lived
with
her
husband
for
over
15
years
and
live
at
least
a
150
miles
from
the
expected
or
whereabouts
of
her
husband.
she
did
not
even
know
whether
he
was
alive
but
she
can
recover
for
the
death
of
that
child
although
everyone
knows
the
child
is
illegitimate.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it's
legitimate
by
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
this
is
--
this
points
out
the
fact
that
louisiana
doesn't
--
isn't
really
aiming
that
as
the
court
says
as
protecting
the
society
against
extra-marital
or
premarital
relations.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
in
louisiana
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
there
is
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
oh!
no.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
i'm
just
pointing
out
the
fictions
as
to
legitimacy
and
the
ostensible
purposes
held
out
to
be
the
real
reasons
by
the
louisiana
courts.
and
in
my
brief,
i
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief
a
table
that
i
have
compiled
from
the
very
statistics
available
that
louisiana
has
the
highest
illegitimacy
rate
in
the
country.
it's
twice
the
national
rate
and
since
1940,
it's
moved
from
almost
50
out
of
a
thousand
births
to
over
a
100
in
1964
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
sent
out.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no.
no,
mr.
justice.
the
illegitimate
child
--
well
here,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
his
pain
and
suffering.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
but
there
is
no
--
to
answer
that
question,
the
delegated
or
designated
heirs
must
bring
the
action.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
could
in
a
succession
proceeding,
inherit
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
cannot
bring
that.
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
that
she
cannot
do
that.
even
if
she
could
–
even
if
she
could
as
an
heir,
my
understanding
of
that
--
i'm
not
too
clear
on
that.
maybe
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
can
clear
that
up
but
my
understanding
is
that
she
cannot
bring
that
action
unless
she
could
inherit
in
a
succession
proceeding,
in
an
estate
proceeding.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
can
if
she
proves
that
she
was
in
the
right
--
that
she
had
acknowledged
the
child
which
she
could.
she
could
prove
that
she
acknowledged
the
child
because
the
birth
certificate
has
her
signature
or
her
name.
the
child
was
born
in
the
name
billy
brade
and
her
name
was
minnie
brade
and
the
mother
is
designated
thereon
and
i
(voice
overlap).
my
recollection
serves
that
she
signed
the
birth
certificate.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
think.
i
think
they
treated
as
part
of
the
tort
action
and
not
as
part
of
the
property
that
is
inherited.
i
think
the
counsel
for
respondents
can
clarify
that
but
i'm
not
too
certain
about
that.
i
don't
think
she
can
do
that
as
far
as
his
cause
of
action
was
concerned
prior
to
his
death.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
event
a
child,
a
father
or
a
mother
has
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children,
he
can
never
legitimate
those
children
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
can
never
legitimate
the
illegitimate
children
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
number
two,
in
the
appendix
to
this
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
if
the
--
if
the
father
or
the
mother
has
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
neither
may
ever
legitimate
the
illegitimate
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
as
long
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
as
they
have
legitimate
children.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
because
under
the
--
insofar
as
forced
heirship
and
the
rules
of
inheritance
are
concerned
because
you
cannot
deprive
the
forced
heirs
of
any
property
or
benefit
of
the
law
to
the
--
or
you
cannot
grant
to
the
illegitimate
heir
where
you
were
deprive
to
the
legitimate.
for
example
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
they
could
adopt,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
then
you
can
adopt
but
not
legitimate.
there
is
a
distinction
in
louisiana
law.
there
is
legitimation,
acknowledgement
and
adoption.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
from
the
point
of
view,
if
they
have
legitimate
children
they
may
not
--
it
would
seem
that
question
is
not
exactly
been
decided
but
it
would
seem
cannot
be
done
in
view
of
the
fact
if
the
court
would
take
this
property
viewpoint
or
this
inheritance
viewpoint
of
2315.
it
would
seem
that
the
same
reasoning
would
apply.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
book
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
if
he
has
no
legitimate
children.
if
he
has
no
legitimate
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
would
not
be
recognized,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
have
the
case
mr.
justice,
but
that
is
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
the
rule
of
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
as
far
as
2315,
i
don't
think
the
case
has
been
decided
on
that
question
but
insofar
as
it
would
be
analogized
to
the
forced
heirship
that
is
the
position
on
legitimation
not
on
adoption.
adoption
can
be
done
of
course.
the
--
to
answer
the
question
further,
the
civil
code
is
broken
up
into
three
books.
the
first
book
treats
the
persons.
the
second
book
treats
of
things
and
the
mode
of
acquiring
thing
or
the
different
modifications
of
ownership.
the
third
book
treats
of
the
modes
of
acquiring
things.
the
first
book
on
persons
does
not
contain
2315.
the
second
book
on
the
modifications
of
ownership
does
not
contain
2315
it
is
in
the
acquisition
of
things
and
conventional
obligations
in
quasi-contract
and
offenses.
the
third
book
which
sets
up
the
2315.
the
first
title
carries
the
whole
succession
law
of
louisiana.
the
second
title
of
the
book
three
contains
the
whole
donation
law
of
louisiana.
the
third
title
of
the
book
three
contains
all
of
the
obligation
law
of
louisiana.
the
fourth
title
is
the
conventional
obligations.
and
the
fifth
title
is
the
quasi-contract
and
the
offenses
law
in
the
louisiana.
successions,
is
in
title
1
and
it
starts
with
article
871
to
1466
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
law
of
successions.
article
2315
is
in
the
fifth
title
and
does
not
purport
to
be
an
inheritance
statute.
it
does
not
purport
to
regulate
forced
heir
or
forced
heirship
and
i
submit
has
no
relation
at
all
to
forced
heirship.
they
never
intended
by
legislation
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
that's
by
the
same
token,
the
reason
for
classifying
out
or
fencing
out
illegitimates
in
2315
is
not
the
forced
heirship
argument.
no
court
has
said
that
that
was
the
reason.
only
one
court
mentioned
the
reason
for
fencing
out
illegitimates
and
that
was
the
levy
court
of
appeals
and
louisiana
court
of
appeals
and
it
said
it
was
general
morals
and
it
discourages
bringing
children
in
the
world
out
of
wedlock
and
that
was
a
hundred
years
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
under
1970?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
court
there
in
lynch
v.
knoop
considered
the
case
as
--
considered
the
statute
as
sui
generis.
it
was
in
derogation
of
common
right,
common
law
and
therefore
it
had
to
be
strictly
construed
the
idea
that
what
was
contained
in
the
statute
automatically
excluded
everything
else.
and
no
reference
was
made
to
the
definitional
article
on
children.
but
there
is
no
definition
in
the
definitional
article
on
parents
or
father
or
mother
in
article
3556.
there
is
a
definition
of
children
where
children
are
considered
to
be
legitimate
children
were
used
in
the
code
but
no
definition
of
mother
or
father
or
parents.
but
the
lynch
v.
knoop
case
was
decided
strictly
on
the
idea
of
sui
generis
of
the
case
being
--
of
the
statute
being
sui
generis.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
being
in
derogation
of
common
right
that
it
was
not
--
the
right
of
recovery
for
wrongful
death
was
not
afforded
to
the
population
or
the
citizenry
of
louisiana
as
part
of
its
general
law
and
it
had
to
be
enacted
by
statute,
and
therefore
the
statute
was
in
derogation
of
common
law
had
to
be
construed
as
of
itself
in
some
class.
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
submit
that
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
that.
the
--
i
think
--
it's
pointed
out
on
my
brief
that
all
wrongful
death
statutes
would
pass
for
compensatory
purposes.
and
to
treat
a
compensatory
act
in
a
retrogressive
fashion
rather
than
look
to
other
compensatory
acts
in
the
state
is
to
treat
the
legislation
as
if
in
a
frustrating
manner.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
other
side
of
the
coin
in
the
case
which
was
just
heard
by
this
court,
namely
--
i
have
a
petitioner
before
this
court
who
was
a
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child,
whose
child
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
louisiana.
the
mother
was
a
domiciliary
of
texas,
however.
her
son
at
the
age
of
19
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
louisiana.
there
is
no
question
that
had
the
accident
occurred
in
texas
and
had
the
petitioner
been
able
to
sue
in
texas,
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover
under
the
texas
wrongful
death
statute
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
brought
into
this
world
an
illegitimate
child.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
this
was
a
minor
son.
he
was
19
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
death.
he
was
a
war
baby.
she
was
not
married
at
the
time
of
conception
nor
at
the
time
of
birth.
the
nature
of
the
case
surrounds
itself
with
the
civil
code
of
louisiana
as
it
relates
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
submit
that
the
civil
code
itself
contains
equal
protection
theories
especially
in
article
xxi
where
the
courts
are
directed
to
decide
cases
according
to
natural
reason
law,
natural
reason
and
equity
where
there
is
no
precise
law
on
the
subject.
in
this
particular
instance,
2315
must
be
considered
as
the
tort
doctrine
of
louisiana
and
it
is
solely
the
tort
doctrine
of
louisiana.
the
article
itself
says,
“every
act
whatever
of
men
which
causes
damage
to
another
obliges
him
by
his
fault
that
occurred
to
repair
it.”
the
statute
then
continues
with
verbiage
to
grant
the
right
to
recover
from
wrongful
death
to
allow
it
to
survive
and
to
grant
this
right
to
“children”,
“mothers
or
fathers”,
“brothers
or
sisters”.
this
is
the
terminology
that
is
used.it
has
been
argued
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
matter
that
article
3556,
“section
8”,
which
is
the
definitional
article
in
the
civil
code,
defines
children
as
being
only
legitimate
children.
children
when
used
around
the
code,
unless
otherwise,
used
refer
to
legitimate
children.
it
does
not
include
illegitimate
children
who
are
acknowledged
and
it
does
not
include
ordinarily
what
would
otherwise
be
termed
bastards.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
justice,
if
she
had
legitimated
the
child,
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover.
how
--
she
would
have
been
able
to
recover.
however,
she
only
acknowledged
the
child.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
if
she
only
acknowledged
the
child,
she
could
not
recover
under
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
legitimation
is
accomplished
by
notarial
act.
but
legitimation
can
only
occur
where
the
child
could
have
been
born
of
a
valid
marriage
if
the
mother
and
the
father
then
could
have
legally
concepted.
for
example,
in
adulterous
child,
the
product
of
an
adulterous
union
could
not
be
legitimated;
it
could
not
be
effectively
acknowledged.
but
in
under
any
–-
mr.
william
f.
wessel
by
adoption,
the
article
2315
specifically
allows
recovery
in
instances
of
a
doctrine.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
could
have
adopted
this
child.
there's
no
question.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
however,
there
was
no
need
for
mrs.
glona
to
adopt
this
child.
there
was
no
need
for
mrs.
glona
to
acknowledge
this
child.
there
is
no
need
for
mrs.
galona
to
legitimate
this
child
because
she
cannot
be
--
it
cannot
be
construed
that
she
took
into
account
louisiana
law
when
she
had
her
premarital
intercourse.
even
under
the
fiction
that
you
understand
the
law
of
the
locale
in
which
you
live,
which
louisiana
indulges
in,
mrs.
glona
at
the
time
of
conception
and
the
time
of
birth
was
a
texas
domiciliary
as
she
could
not
have
adverted
to
louisiana
law
in
this
matter
to
determine
what
she
should
have
done.
it
was
only
after
the
child
was
born
and
raised
to
a
great
degree
that
he
moved
to
louisiana
and
there
is
where
he
was
killed.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
justice,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
state
has
never
given
a
reason.
the
only
reason
that
the
state
has
given
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
the
court
can
imagine
one
if
the
classification
itself
is
not
inherently
suspect.
those
are
only
what
i
would
term
--
as
i
have
termed
in
my
brief
the
functional
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
f.
wessel
what
makes
this
case
inherently
suspect
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
is
the
fact
of
illegitimacy,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
mother
could
have
helped
that
but
she
did
not;
she
did
not.
but
the
classification
itself
is
there.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
there's
no
question
about
that,
she
is.
i
submit
only
that
she
did
not
in
this
particular
case.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
view
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
brings
this
action
for
wrongful
death,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
this
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
out
where
the
child
died.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
brings
this
on
her
own
right,
lost
of
affection,
support
and
love.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
child
must
bring
the
action.
if
he's
a
minor,
the
two
of
them
must
be
appointed
by
the
court.
and
she
could
be
appointed
too
but
she
would
not
be
the
natural
--
she
would
not
be
automatically
(voice
overlap)
appointed.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
child
could
recover
for
his
personal
injuries.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
he
could
still
but
if
he
were
living.
but
if
he
is
dead,
he
cannot.
he
cannot.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
mr.
justice,
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
texas
provides
--
gives
to
the
mothers
of
illegitimate
and
illegitimate
the
same
rights
as
if
the
child
were
legitimate.
and
this
comes
back
to
an
early
case,
i
believe
in
1908,
galveston
v.
walker
where
the
--
it
was
the
court
imposed
this
rule
because
louisiana
seems
to
take
the
approach
of
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
illegitimate
children
were
not
mentioned
in
2350.
it
negates,
it
fails
to
look
at
the
statute
in
terms
of
its
broad
compensatory
purposes.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
lord
campbell's
act
was
first
passed
in
1846.
louisiana,
failing
to
follow
the
french
law,
did
not
under
its
general
tort
law
which
is
comprised
in
2350,
did
not
give
a
right
for
wrongful
death
until
1855
which
by
statute
it
first
enacted
its
wrongful
death
statute
presumably
to
compensate,
to
give
a
general
right
where
no
general
right
existed
before
and
i
submit
that
where
a
state
purports
to
give
a
general
right
to
its
population
if
it
classifies
by
its
application
as
has
been
done
by
the
louisiana
courts,
if
it
classifies
or
fences
out
of
that
general
right
a
certain
portion
of
the
population,
it
then
must
show
the
purpose
and
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
classification
that
is
made.
i
submit
that
the
argument
made
by
the
respondents
or
the
appellees
in
the
levy
case
here
today
that
2315
is
an
inheritance
statute
is
incorrect.
it
is
not
related
to
the
forced
heirship
laws
of
louisiana.
it
is
the
tort
law
of
louisiana.
a
tort
law
providing
a
general
remedy,
a
general
relief
and
it
is
not
the
inheritance
law
and
it
therefore
does
not
pertain
to
family
life.
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
still
apply
to
family
life
or
family
status.
loving
versus
virginia
certainly
affected
the
family
situation
as
well
as
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
and
certainly,
the
griffin
case
affected
family
life
and
family
status.
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
certainly
applies
in
this
instance
and
it
applies
under
a
two-fold
approach.
it
applies
either
that
there
is
an
intrinsic
classification,
an
intrinsic
suspect
classification,
a
constitutional
irrelevance
as
we
said
in
edwards
versus
california
where
status
is
the
sole
reason
for
the
classification.
if
as
we
said
in
mclaughlin,
if
as
we
said
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
loving
versus
virginia,
the
classification
itself
is
arbitrarily
set
up,
then
the
state
has
an
overriding
burden
of
justifying
that
classification.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
griffin.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i'm
sorry.
i'm
thinking
about
connecticut
birth
control
case.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
griswold.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
the
inherently
suspect
classification
test
applies
here.certainly
in
yick
wo,
we
had
a
chinese
man,
a
laundry
man
who
could
not
operate
his
laundry
and
there,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
court
had
held
that
classification
to
be
intrinsically
suspect.
under
mclaughlin,
we
had
the
race
test
because
in
florida
it
was
the
crime
for
whites
and
negroes
to
have
premarital
intercourse
but
not
for
whites
and
whites
and
negroes
and
negroes.
and
certainly
in
the
miscegenation
case
in
loving
versus
virginia,
we
have
the
intrinsic
classification
again.
we
have
it
again
in
hirabayashi,
we
have
it
in
oyama
which
is
an
inheritance,
which
was
an
inheritance
situation
where
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that
they're
race
cases.
well,
we
have
carrington
versus
rash
which
was
servicemen
and
we
have
in
hernandez
which
is
mexican.
nationality
rather
than
race,
i
would
suppose.
i
don't
know
how
we
would
classify
this.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
and
she
did
not.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
did
not
do
that
because
she
did
not
--
i
submit
she
did
not
have
to
contemplate
louisiana
law.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
did
not
have
to
do
anything,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
could
she
have
gone
through
an
act
of
legitimation?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
could
have
adopted
in
texas.
she
did
not
have
to
do
either
in
order
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes.
this
case
was
brought
in
diversity
in
the
federal
district
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no
barrier.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
what
i
said
mr.
justice.
that
is
correct.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
that
texas
would
have
that.
louisiana
has
it
peculiarly
because
it
affects
the
right
of
inheritance
in
this
intense
situation.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
the
texas
has
it.
i
can't
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
certainly,
i
believe
that
they
could
have.
yes,
i
think
that
texas
certainly
has
adoption
laws.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
main
contention,
of
course,
is
that
the
classification
is
automatically
suspect
and
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
must
be
undertaken
by
the
state
or
the
defendants
in
this
case
not
by
the
plaintiff
herself.
the
other
approach
to
equal
protection
which
i
would
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
illegitimate
children
may
inherit
from
their
mothers
and
mothers
of
illegitimates
may
inherit
from
the
illegitimate
in
texas.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
as
to
the
father,
however,
i
have
cited
the
26
brooklyn
law
review
which
is
as
far
as
inheritance
goes
in
1959
article
in
my
brief
at
page
18
which
does
set
out
every
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
as
of
1959
and
points
out
the
inheritable
rights
vis-à-vis
mother
vis-à-vis
the
child's
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
am
virtually
certain
that
they
can
if
--
in
some
jurisdictions.
in
my
research
in
this
matter,
i
went
through
every
state
and
in
my
brief
i
pointed
out
the
results
of
my
research
as
to
the
mother
vis-à-vis
the
child
but
not
the
father.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
will,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
will,
mr.
justice.
i
will
research
that
and
i
will
furnish
that
to
the
court.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
think
that
this
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
proof.
i
think
illegitimacy
is
an
irrelevant
--
is
irrelevant
under
the
constitution.
the
fact
of
illegitimacy
is
irrelevant.
i
submit
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it's
absolutely
irrelevant.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
my
contention
as
far
as
where
a
general
right
is
concerned.
i
distinguish
this
case
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
that
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
submit
that
it
is
irrelevant.
i
think
that
the
--
what
is
relevant
is
the
question
of
proof
in
those
proceedings
but
certainly
not
the
question
of
status.
i
submit
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
approach
to
equal
protection
which
this
court
has
taken
is
what
i
term
the
functional
approach.
that
is
to
say
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
classification
made
and
whether
or
not
it
can
be
justified.
i
think
that
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
gone
--
have
overlapped
as
far
as
the
constitutional
irrelevance
or
inherently
suspect
classification
test
is
concerned
and
the
functional
approach
as
was
done
in
mclaughlin,
i
believe,
which
said
that
it
always
classifies
on
the
basis
of
race
because
the
heavy
burden
of
justification,
it
will
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
necessary
and
not
merely
rationally
related
to
the
state
purpose.
now,
under
the
functional
approach
which
i
think
mr.
justice
jackson
set
out
in
--
quite
clearly
and
railway
express
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
where
the
equal
protection
seizes
to
apply
equality
or
to
give
protection
where
the
purpose
of
the
statute
does
not
relate
or
the
purpose
or
the
classification
made
does
not
relate
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
for
example,
in
smith
v.
cahoon,
the
state
of
florida
required
that
all
negligent,
all
operators
of
motor
carriers
on
the
highways
have
furnished
financial
responsibility.
but
it
accepted
out,
it
fenced
out
of
that
application
those
carriers
of
produced
and
those
carriers
of
foreign
goods.
in
that
case,
under
the
functional
approach
and
i
think
it
points
it
out
very
adequately
the
purpose
of
the
statute
obviously
was
to
protect
the
general
motoring
public.
the
classification
made
did
not
achieve
that
purpose
and
that
is
an
economic
interest
and
that
this
case
can
afford
--
if
this
is
considered
to
be
a
property
right,
then
certainly
in
this
case,
we
have
the
same
idea
as
to
purpose
of
classification.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i'm
saying
if
the
classification
made
had
relates
to
the
purpose
of
the
act,
then
the
classification
can't
be
made.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
louisiana
can
require
all
illegitimate
--
all
mothers
of
illegitimates
to
legitimate
its
children
under
penalty
of
some
law
and
their
failure
to
do
so
would
deny
them
certain
rights.
yes,
i
believe
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
not
in
a
wrongful
death
statute,
mr.
justice.
a
wrongful
death
statute
has
as
its
purpose
not
set
up
rules
for
illegitimates
but
has
as
its
purpose
fundamentally
even
in
lord
campbell's
act
in
1846
to
compensate
individuals
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
its
wrongful
death
statute
could
conceivably
have
a
dual
purpose.
it
could
conceivably
yes
and
a
classification
could
be
made
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
then
i'd
say
it
relates
back
that
this
sort
of
classification
cannot
be
made.
under
this
sort
of
an
approach
where
the
classification
--
if
the
classification
made
is
not
inherently
suspect
before
by
reason
of
its
--
the
classification
that's
made.
the
status,
as
i
interpret
this,
then
if
that
classification
cannot
be
made,
it
can
never
be
made.
no
classification
can
be
made
as
to
negroes
in
most
instances
except
perhaps,
may
be
in
registering
births.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
it's
not.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
characteristically,
the
wrongful
death
issue.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
well,
in
november
of
last
year,
the
three-judge
court,
which
this
court
has
granted
in
smith
versus
king
which
decided
the
american
jewish
congress
amicus
brief.
it
points
out
the
decision
there
that
where
a
state
has
given
something
like
aid
to
dependent
children,
it
cannot
take
away
that
aid.
they
considered
that
the
three-judge
court,
federal
court,
considered
that
to
be
a
general
right
which
i
think
is
analogous
to
this
situation.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
solely
on
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
louisiana
as
the
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana
had
interpreted
the
wrongful
death
statute
and
it
relied
also
in
morey
v.
doud.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
per
curiam
decision
was
relied
solely.
the
only
case
cited
was
morey
v.
doud,
which
was
a
case
on
equal
protection
in
which
the
court
had
held
--
the
supreme
court
had
held
that
the
classification
there
in
an
economic
matter
was
held
to
be
unreasonable
and
that
related
to
the
american
express
company.
the
state
of
illinois
had
required
all
banking
institutions
or
those
issuing
money
orders
to,
in
that
instance,
to
register
with
the
illinois
security
exchange
commission.
but
it
excluded
out
of
that
classification.
it
fenced
out
of
that
classification
the
american
express
company
because
it
was
a
national
concern
and
morey
versus
doud
decided
by
this
court
held
that
such
a
classification
did
not
meet
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
since
it
did
not
meet
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
failed
under
the
functional
approach
to
equal
protection.
and
i
failed
to
see
and
i
think
looked
at
it
how
the
equal
protection
clause
--
how
the
fencing
out
of
illegitimates,
illegitimate
families,
mothers,
fathers
or
children,
under
the
use
of
2315,
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
louisiana
can
that
classification
can
be
made
in
view
of
the
obvious
purpose
of
that
wrongful
death
statute.
louisiana
courts
allow
employers
to
recover
for
the
wrongful
death
children,
for
the
wrongful
death
of
an
employee
but
will
not
allow
that
employee's
illegitimate
children
to
recover
for
his
wrongful
death
in
effect
and
that
case
is
also
cited
in
the
brief
of
counsel
in
thomas
v.
matthews
lumber
company
by
reason
of
workmen's
compensation
aspect
to
the
case.
louisiana
also
has
a
peculiar
rule
as
to
illegitimates.
it
presumes
that
every
child
born
of
a
mother,
born
of
a
woman
who
is
married
is
legitimate,
regardless
of
whether
that
woman
is
living
with
her
husband,
regardless
of
whether
he
has
access.
i'm
representing
in
the
state
of
louisiana
today
a
woman
for
the
wrongful
death
of
her
child
and
she,
this
child
was
two
years
old
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted
and
she
have
not
lived
with
her
husband
for
over
15
years
and
live
at
least
a
150
miles
from
the
expected
or
whereabouts
of
her
husband.
she
did
not
even
know
whether
he
was
alive
but
she
can
recover
for
the
death
of
that
child
although
everyone
knows
the
child
is
illegitimate.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
it's
legitimate
by
statute.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
this
is
--
this
points
out
the
fact
that
louisiana
doesn't
--
isn't
really
aiming
that
as
the
court
says
as
protecting
the
society
against
extra-marital
or
premarital
relations.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
in
louisiana
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
there
is
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
oh!
no.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
i'm
just
pointing
out
the
fictions
as
to
legitimacy
and
the
ostensible
purposes
held
out
to
be
the
real
reasons
by
the
louisiana
courts.
and
in
my
brief,
i
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief
a
table
that
i
have
compiled
from
the
very
statistics
available
that
louisiana
has
the
highest
illegitimacy
rate
in
the
country.
it's
twice
the
national
rate
and
since
1940,
it's
moved
from
almost
50
out
of
a
thousand
births
to
over
a
100
in
1964
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
sent
out.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no.
no,
mr.
justice.
the
illegitimate
child
--
well
here,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
his
pain
and
suffering.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
but
there
is
no
--
to
answer
that
question,
the
delegated
or
designated
heirs
must
bring
the
action.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
could
in
a
succession
proceeding,
inherit
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
she
cannot
bring
that.
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
that
she
cannot
do
that.
even
if
she
could
–
even
if
she
could
as
an
heir,
my
understanding
of
that
--
i'm
not
too
clear
on
that.
maybe
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
can
clear
that
up
but
my
understanding
is
that
she
cannot
bring
that
action
unless
she
could
inherit
in
a
succession
proceeding,
in
an
estate
proceeding.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
she
can
if
she
proves
that
she
was
in
the
right
--
that
she
had
acknowledged
the
child
which
she
could.
she
could
prove
that
she
acknowledged
the
child
because
the
birth
certificate
has
her
signature
or
her
name.
the
child
was
born
in
the
name
billy
brade
and
her
name
was
minnie
brade
and
the
mother
is
designated
thereon
and
i
(voice
overlap).
my
recollection
serves
that
she
signed
the
birth
certificate.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
think.
i
think
they
treated
as
part
of
the
tort
action
and
not
as
part
of
the
property
that
is
inherited.
i
think
the
counsel
for
respondents
can
clarify
that
but
i'm
not
too
certain
about
that.
i
don't
think
she
can
do
that
as
far
as
his
cause
of
action
was
concerned
prior
to
his
death.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
event
a
child,
a
father
or
a
mother
has
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children,
he
can
never
legitimate
those
children
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
can
never
legitimate
the
illegitimate
children
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
number
two,
in
the
appendix
to
this
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
if
the
--
if
the
father
or
the
mother
has
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
neither
may
ever
legitimate
the
illegitimate
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
as
long
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--
as
they
have
legitimate
children.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
because
under
the
--
insofar
as
forced
heirship
and
the
rules
of
inheritance
are
concerned
because
you
cannot
deprive
the
forced
heirs
of
any
property
or
benefit
of
the
law
to
the
--
or
you
cannot
grant
to
the
illegitimate
heir
where
you
were
deprive
to
the
legitimate.
for
example
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
they
could
adopt,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
then
you
can
adopt
but
not
legitimate.
there
is
a
distinction
in
louisiana
law.
there
is
legitimation,
acknowledgement
and
adoption.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
from
the
point
of
view,
if
they
have
legitimate
children
they
may
not
--
it
would
seem
that
question
is
not
exactly
been
decided
but
it
would
seem
cannot
be
done
in
view
of
the
fact
if
the
court
would
take
this
property
viewpoint
or
this
inheritance
viewpoint
of
2315.
it
would
seem
that
the
same
reasoning
would
apply.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
book
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
if
he
has
no
legitimate
children.
if
he
has
no
legitimate
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
would
not
be
recognized,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
have
the
case
mr.
justice,
but
that
is
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
the
rule
of
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
as
far
as
2315,
i
don't
think
the
case
has
been
decided
on
that
question
but
insofar
as
it
would
be
analogized
to
the
forced
heirship
that
is
the
position
on
legitimation
not
on
adoption.
adoption
can
be
done
of
course.
the
--
to
answer
the
question
further,
the
civil
code
is
broken
up
into
three
books.
the
first
book
treats
the
persons.
the
second
book
treats
of
things
and
the
mode
of
acquiring
thing
or
the
different
modifications
of
ownership.
the
third
book
treats
of
the
modes
of
acquiring
things.
the
first
book
on
persons
does
not
contain
2315.
the
second
book
on
the
modifications
of
ownership
does
not
contain
2315
it
is
in
the
acquisition
of
things
and
conventional
obligations
in
quasi-contract
and
offenses.
the
third
book
which
sets
up
the
2315.
the
first
title
carries
the
whole
succession
law
of
louisiana.
the
second
title
of
the
book
three
contains
the
whole
donation
law
of
louisiana.
the
third
title
of
the
book
three
contains
all
of
the
obligation
law
of
louisiana.
the
fourth
title
is
the
conventional
obligations.
and
the
fifth
title
is
the
quasi-contract
and
the
offenses
law
in
the
louisiana.
successions,
is
in
title
1
and
it
starts
with
article
871
to
1466
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
law
of
successions.
article
2315
is
in
the
fifth
title
and
does
not
purport
to
be
an
inheritance
statute.
it
does
not
purport
to
regulate
forced
heir
or
forced
heirship
and
i
submit
has
no
relation
at
all
to
forced
heirship.
they
never
intended
by
legislation
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
that's
by
the
same
token,
the
reason
for
classifying
out
or
fencing
out
illegitimates
in
2315
is
not
the
forced
heirship
argument.
no
court
has
said
that
that
was
the
reason.
only
one
court
mentioned
the
reason
for
fencing
out
illegitimates
and
that
was
the
levy
court
of
appeals
and
louisiana
court
of
appeals
and
it
said
it
was
general
morals
and
it
discourages
bringing
children
in
the
world
out
of
wedlock
and
that
was
a
hundred
years
--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
under
1970?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
court
there
in
lynch
v.
knoop
considered
the
case
as
--
considered
the
statute
as
sui
generis.
it
was
in
derogation
of
common
right,
common
law
and
therefore
it
had
to
be
strictly
construed
the
idea
that
what
was
contained
in
the
statute
automatically
excluded
everything
else.
and
no
reference
was
made
to
the
definitional
article
on
children.
but
there
is
no
definition
in
the
definitional
article
on
parents
or
father
or
mother
in
article
3556.
there
is
a
definition
of
children
where
children
are
considered
to
be
legitimate
children
were
used
in
the
code
but
no
definition
of
mother
or
father
or
parents.
but
the
lynch
v.
knoop
case
was
decided
strictly
on
the
idea
of
sui
generis
of
the
case
being
--
of
the
statute
being
sui
generis.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
being
in
derogation
of
common
right
that
it
was
not
--
the
right
of
recovery
for
wrongful
death
was
not
afforded
to
the
population
or
the
citizenry
of
louisiana
as
part
of
its
general
law
and
it
had
to
be
enacted
by
statute,
and
therefore
the
statute
was
in
derogation
of
common
law
had
to
be
construed
as
of
itself
in
some
class.
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
submit
that
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
that.
the
--
i
think
--
it's
pointed
out
on
my
brief
that
all
wrongful
death
statutes
would
pass
for
compensatory
purposes.
and
to
treat
a
compensatory
act
in
a
retrogressive
fashion
rather
than
look
to
other
compensatory
acts
in
the
state
is
to
treat
the
legislation
as
if
in
a
frustrating
manner.
thank
you,
your
honors.
