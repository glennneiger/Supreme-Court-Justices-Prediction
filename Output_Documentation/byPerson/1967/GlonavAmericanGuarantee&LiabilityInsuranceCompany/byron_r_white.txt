what
did
the
state
say,
we
have
a
policy
of
encouraging
the
legitimization
of
these
children
and
that
until
and
unless
they
are
legitimatized,
the
mother
can't
recover,
and
we
--
and
so
this
is
a
policy
that
promotes
the
legitimating
of
the
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
equal
protection
cases
say
that
--
no
matter
--
whether
the
state
gives
one
or
not,
they
don't
have
to
as
the
court
can
imagine
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
makes
this
inherently
suspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
taking
the
same
argument
as
the
previous
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
mother
could
have
helped
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mother
certainly
is
in
a
different
stands
and
that
--
in
a
different
position
than
the
children
in
terms
of
being
able
to
do
something
about
the
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
race
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
louisiana
had
said
in
that
statute
that
we
do
this
to
make
sure
that
mothers
will
legitimatize
their
children?
and
in
furtherance
of
this
policy,
any
woman
who
has
not
legitimatized
their
children
may
not
recover,
may
not
do
the
following
things,
one
of
which
is
recover
for
the
wrongful
death
of
their
illegitimate
child
in
louisiana.
would
you
--
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
i
suppose.
you're
just
saying
that's
an
unacceptable
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
that
situation
i
just
post
you
then?
louisiana
states
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
they
had
articulated
this
basis
for
the
statute,
you
would
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
to
compensate
the
mother.
they
say
to
the
mother,
“now
look,
if
you
don't
legitimatize
your
children,
there
are
several
things
you're
going
to
be
barred
from,
one
of
them
is
to
be
compensated
for
the
death
of
your
illegitimate
child
if
you
don't
legitimate
it.”
now,
you
would
say
the
state
couldn't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
could
conceive
that,
why
shouldn't
we
uphold
this
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
race
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
fourth
amendment
case.
it's
in
the
area
that's
characteristically
within
the
control
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
why
should
a
state
regulation
in
this
area
be
inherently
suspect
in
the
sense
that
it
--
the
state
must
come
up
with
some
overriding
explanation
that's
perfectly
clear?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
the
fifth
circuit
doesn't
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
to
reach
the
federal
constitutional
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
--
i
suppose
the
death
of
this
illegitimate
child
gave
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
illegitimate
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
be
the
mother
be
the
heir
for
that?
can
she
bring
--does
she
inherit
from
her
illegitimate
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
she
could
bring
the
action
for
the
pain
and
suffering
and
the
damages
to
the
child
but
she
couldn't
bring
the
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
she
can,
can't
she?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
couldn't
inherit
her
illegitimate
child's
cause
of
action
and
sue
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
it
would
reach
denying
inheritance
to
adopted
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
mother
can't
sue
here,
can
anyone
else
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
father
--
can
the
father
legitimate
a
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
–-
would
you
have
same
response
--
i
suppose
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
plaintiff
is
the
--
is
an
illegitimate
brother
of
the
illegitimate
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
really
is
a
--
let's
just
say
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
killing
an
illegitimate
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
net
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
just
aimed
at
--
it
isn't
aim
at
disentitling
mothers
of
illegitimate
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
brother
of
an
illegitimate
really
isn't
a
brother,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
had
a
wife
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
adopt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
(voice
overlap).
justice

what
