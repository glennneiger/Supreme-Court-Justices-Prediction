justice
potter
stewart
was
this
a
minor
son?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
your
third
case
that
you
just
talk
about,
mclaughlin,
loving
and
griffin
or
griffus?
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
griswold,
i
suggest.
justice
potter
stewart
she
have
done
that
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
in
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
be
of
some
importance
in
this
case,
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
she
was
a
domiciliary
of
texas,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask?
but
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
i
wonder
if
she
could
have
done
this
if
there
is
such
a
procedure
in
texas
because
of
about
my
brother
brennan
is
quite
right
and
under
texas
law
it
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
problem.
it
does
have
to
do
with
the
mother's
recognition
of
the
illegitimate
child
as
her
child.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
many
other
states
have
it
i
know
of.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
that's
not
true.
the
child
is
legitimate
under
the
law
of
louisiana.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
that's
not
a
unique
or
unusual
rule.
that's
a
very,
very
common
presumption
everywhere
in
the
--
in
common
law
and
every
one
of
the
states
that
i
know
anything
about.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
justice
potter
stewart
the
purpose
of
that
law
is
to
protect
the
status
of
the
child
and
the
status
of
the
marriage
and
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
child.
but
in
your
case,
you
cannot
do
that
because
at
the
time
of
the
child's
birth
there
was
no
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
objecting
to
that
law,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
with
that
presumption.
you
don't
think
that
violates
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
without
the
wife,
the
children
can
be.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
had
another
--
if
he
had
a
brother
who
was
also
illegitimate,
could
he
sue?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
this
mother
had
two
illegitimate
sons,
could
the
brother
sue
in
behalf
of
the
decedant?
justice
potter
stewart
either
one
as
a
single
parent
can
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
either
the
father
or
the
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
except
the
statute
doesn't
say,
it
doesn't
make
any
distinction
at
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
a
matter
state
law
beginning
1907
under
the
2315?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
illegitimate
person
himself
had
a
wife,
a
legitimate
wife
or
children
is
a
cause
of
action
for
his
death.
justice
potter
stewart
not
quite
the
way
justice
white
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
you,
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
statute,
couldn't
the
mother
or
father
of
legitimate
children
legitimate
illegitimate
children
to
the
point
of
this
statute
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
louisiana
does
provide
a
procedure,
a
very
simple
procedure,
for
a
parent
to
legitimate
his
illegitimate
child.
that's
the
notarial
act
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
are
you
telling
us
that
under
this
statute
and
that
that
such
a
legitimate
married
child
would
that
louisiana
has
held
that
that
person
has
no
right
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
what?
what
case
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
contrary
what
we've
been
told
during
this
whole
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
talking
about
this
tort
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
then
i
should
think
if
you're
right
then
a
parent
of
a
legitimate
children
could
legitimate
illegitimates
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
forced
heirship.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
1970
decision
rested?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
one?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
mean
in

justice

was
this
