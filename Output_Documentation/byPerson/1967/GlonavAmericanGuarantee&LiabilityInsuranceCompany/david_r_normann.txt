mr.
david
r.
normann
may
it
please
court.
mr.
david
r.
normann
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor,
is
that
she
could
not.
she
could
not
maintain
the
action
either
for
the
survival
action
nor
can
she
maintain
it
for
the
course
of
action.
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
has
been
said
in
the
case
preceding
ours
and
as
well
as
in
this
case
where
the
issues
are
related
although
the
factual
situation
is
different,
i
can
afford
to
limit
my
remarks
just
to
the
fundamental
issue
and
perhaps
attempt
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
post
by
opposing
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
that
basically,
if
the
louisiana
law
is
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
its
classification
of
illegitimates
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
bring
the
action
for
the
death
of
the
legitimate,
it
must
follow
that
this
is
so
with
respect
to
any
law
which
so
classifies
illegitimates
and
which
would
deny
any
type
of
right
of
action
or
any
right
of
inheritance
to
them.
for
example,
in
those
states
which
do
allow
any
illegitimate
to
inherit
from
the
mother
but
not
from
the
father,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
situation
would
be
just
as
unconstitutional
as
the
louisiana
situation
if
the
louisiana
law
is
unconstitutional.
i
believe
if
i
understood
him
right
that
counsel
acknowledges
that
position
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court.
it
also
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
perhaps,
if
the
law
so
provided
and
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
louisiana
law
does
not
so
provide
it.
adopted
children
in
louisiana
say
--
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
legitimate
children.
now,
it
also
seems
to
me
your
honors
that
as
counsels
has
pointed
out,
article
2315
of
our
civil
code
embodies
our
general
tort
law
and
also
is
our
wrongful
death
statute.
and
article
2315
sets
up
various
classifications
in
a
hierarchy
as
to
who
has
a
right
of
action
and
one
class
exclude
the
others.
for
example,
wife
and
children
exclude
parents.
in
the
absence
of
a
spouse,
surviving
spouse
and
children,
then
the
parents
have
the
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
absence
of
either
of
those,
then
brothers
and
sisters
have
the
cause
of
action.
and
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
if
it
is
wrong
to
classify,
if
it
is
unconstitutional
to
classify
with
respect
to
illegitimates,
it
may
be
just
as
wrong
to
classify
in
the
categories
that
i
have
just
amplified.
and
i
also
submit,
although
i
cannot
cite
authority
to
support
this
point
that
i
would
imagine
every
state
in
the
union
has
at
least
a
similar
classification
with
respect
to
who
may
maintain
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
provided
--
yes,
provided
that
there
is
a
legitimate
relation.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
answer
factually
the
question
because
the
court
had
never
reached
that
in
the
local
district.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
that
may
be.
in
this
instance,
i'm
probably
incorrect
of
saying
that
they
could.
i
can't
at
the
moment
conceive
about
a
good
one.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
the
father
can
legitimate
a
child.
he
can
acknowledge
a
child,
you
mean
under
louisiana
law?
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
he
would
also
be
illegitimate
coed
this
decedent.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
brother
was
illegitimate
coed,
this
decedent
no,
not
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
insofar
as
the
father's
concerned,
yes,
sir.
louisiana
law
has
set
a
various
means
for
legitimizing
illegitimates.
i
think
this
point
has
been
made
perhaps
in
the
levy
case.
mr.
david
r.
normann
one,
your
honor,
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
the
parents.
louisiana
law,
i
submit,
is
rather
liberal
in
this
respect.
article
198
of
the
civil
code
provides,
“children
born
out
of
marriage,
except
those
who
are
born
from
an
incestuous
connection,
are
legitimated
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
their
father
and
mother
whenever
the
latter
have
formally
or
informally
acknowledge
them
for
their
children
either
before
or
after
the
marriage”
and
by
a
1948
amendment,
this
includes
adulterous
bastards.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
david
r.
normann
that
may
be
your
honor
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
understand
the
argument
that
counsel
is
now
making
incidentally
attempted
to
make
this
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
was
denied
the
right
since
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
there
and
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
i
understand
the
argument
to
be
that
since
this
lady,
this
petitioner
resided
in
texas,
these
things
would
have
had
been
done
in
texas.
i
can't
answer
that
except
to
say
yes,
of
course,
that's
correct
or
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
pointed
out,
adoption
proceedings
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
child
was
legitimated
in
texas,
the
cause
of
action
exists
in
louisiana.
mr.
david
r.
normann
precisely.
for
example,
common
law
marriages
are
not
recognized
in
louisiana
but
if
common
law
marriages
are
recognized
in
texas
and
that
person
moves
to
louisiana,
all
those
persons
moved
to
louisiana,
those
marriages
is
perfectly
valid
in
louisiana.
mr.
david
r.
normann
may
it
please
the
court.
subsequent
to
yesterday's
adjournment,
i
realized
that
while
in
our
case
and
in
the
previous
case,
we
have
been
discussing
article
2315
of
the
louisiana
civil
code
which
is
our
tort
law
and
provides
for
our
wrongful
death
statute
that
we
had
not
as
yet
read
it
to
the
court
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful,
it's
not
very
long,
if
i
read
it.
it
provides
as
follows;
every
act
whatever
of
man
that
causes
damage
to
another
obliges
him
by
whose
fault
it
happened
to
repair
it.
the
right
to
recover
damages
to
property
caused
by
an
offense
or
quasi-offense
is
a
property
right
which
on
the
death
of
the
obligees
inherited
by
his
legal
instituted
or
irregular
as
subject
to
the
community
rights
of
the
surviving
spouse.
the
right
to
recover
all
other
damages
caused
by
an
offense
or
quasi-offense,
if
the
injured
person
dies,
shall
survive
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
favor
of
one,
the
surviving
spouse
and
child
or
children
of
the
deceased
or
either
such
spouse
or
such
child
or
children;
two,
the
surviving
father
and
mother
of
the
deceased
or
either
of
them
if
he
left
no
spouse
or
child
surviving;
and
three,
the
surviving
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
deceased
or
any
of
them
if
he
left
no
spouse
child
or
parents
survived.
the
survivors
in
whose
favor
this
right
of
action
survives
may
also
recover
for
damages
which
they
sustained
through
the
wrongful
death
of
the
deceased.
a
right
to
recover
damages
under
the
provisions
of
this
paragraph
is
a
property
right
which
on
the
death
of
the
survivor
in
whose
favor
the
right
of
action
survive
is
inherited
by
his
legal
instituted
or
irregular
as
whether
suit
has
been
instituted
thereon
by
the
survivor
or
not.
as
used
in
this
article,
the
words
“child,
brother,
sister,
father,
and
mother”
include
a
child,
brother,
sister,
father
and
mother
by
adoption
respectively.
as
i
say,
that
is
the
basis
for
all
louisiana
tort
law
as
well
as
our
wrongful
death
statute.
i
feel
satisfied
that
the
court
recognizes
that
this
case
does
not
in
any
way
involved
the
racial
issue
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
mentioned
in
my
opponent's
brief.
consequently,
it
seems
that
the
question
with
which
the
court
is
presented
is
this,
has
louisiana
in
classifying
legitimates
and
illegitimates
acted
reasonably
and
in
accord
with
the
--
a
legitimate
purpose
of
its
statutes
so
as
not
to
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
i
submit
of
course
that
we
have
acted
reasonably
for
these
four
reasons.
one,
louisiana
has
exercised
its
legal
right
to
legislate
in
areas
which
affect
the
health,
morals
and
general
welfare
of
its
citizens.
two,
most
certainly
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
sanctity
of
legitimate
relationships
as
produced
through
lawful
marriage.
third,
louisiana
exercises
its
right
to
legislate
so
as
to
preserve
the
family
unit.
and
fourth,
louisiana
has
enacted
specific
and
very
liberal
legislation
to
permit
the
legitimation
of
illegitimates.
thereby
conferring
on
them
all
rights
enjoyed
by
legitimates.discussing
this
briefly
in
the
order
mentioned
that
is
first,
the
right
to
legislate
in
areas
affecting
health,
morals
and
general
welfare.
this
court
has
recognized
in
sanction
the
right
of
a
state
to
enact
such
laws
including
the
right
to
legislate
of
the
area
of
sexual
conduct.
it
was
so
stated
in
mclaughlin
versus
state
of
florida.
the
federal
government
in
all
of
the
states
had
exercised
a
right.
hence,
the
department
of
public
welfare
of
united
states
government
and
the
ordinance
is
the
smallest
township
regulating
and
seeking
to
control
such
things
as
tuberculosis,
venereal
decease.
all
operate
in
the
same
area
and
all
of
these
we
submit
are
entirely
constitutional.
the
criminal
statutes
punishing
illicit
and
unnatural
sexual
conduct
are
also
proper
examples.
the
sanctity
of
maintaining
legitimate
relationships
through
lawful
marriage
while
bearing
from
state
to
state,
every
state
in
the
union
exercises
his
right.
and
i
don't
believe
anyone
would
seriously
question
the
right
or
indeed
the
duty
of
the
state
to
do
so.legislation
designed
to
preserve
a
family
unit.
perhaps
this
court's
holding
in
the
case
of
murphy
versus
ramsey,
states
it
most
delinquently.
the
court
held
certainly
no
legislation
can
be
supposed
more
wholesome
and
necessary
in
the
founding
of
a
free,
self-governing
commonwealth,
and
that
would
seeks
to
establish
it
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
the
family
has
consisting
in
and
springing
from
the
union
for
life
of
one
man
and
one
woman
in
the
holy
state
of
matrimony,
the
sure
foundation
of
all
that
it
is
stable
and
noble
in
our
civilization;
and
finally,
the
legislation
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
allow
the
legitimation
of
illegitimates.
here,
we
respectfully
submit
louisiana
has
gone
quite
far
and
perhaps
has
excelled.
the
history
of
our
state's
law
has
been
one
of
constinent
--
constant
broadening
of
this
concept.
thus,
article
198
of
our
civil
code
provides
children
born
out
of
marriage
except
those
who
are
born
from
his
ancestors'
connection
are
legitimated
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
the
father
and
mother.
whenever
the
latter
have
formally
or
informally
acknowledge
them
for
their
children
either
before
or
after
the
marriage.
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
by
1948
amendment,
this
article
includes
adulterous
bastards.
article
200
of
our
civil
code,
provides
an
unnatural
father
or
mother
may
legitimate
his
or
her
natural
children
by
a
notarial
act
signed
by
two
witnesses
declaring
the
intention
of
a
parent
to
legitimate
such
child
or
children.
article
214
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
either
the
father
or
the
mother.
article
214,
provides
for
adoption
and
the
rights
pursuant
that
too,
and
puts
adopted
children
on
the
same
basis
as
legitimates.
adopted
children
are
included
as
forced
as
under
louisiana
succession
laws,
in
the
levy
case.
the
louisiana
doctrine
of
forced
heirship
i
believe
was
explained
to
the
court.
louisiana
revised
statute
9391
provides
the
authority
for
natural
mothers
and
fathers
to
adopt
their
natural
children
by
notarial
acts.
we
thus
submit
that
louisiana
has
acted
more
than
reasonably
in
the
classification
which
is
here
under
attack.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
we're
--
are
you
speaking
now
of
article
2315,
the
tort
statute?
mr.
david
r.
normann
1907
was
the
first
holding
that
a
mother
in
the
same
situation
we
have
here
your
honors,
a
mother
was
suing
for
the
death
of
her
child,
lynch
versus
knoop
is
the
case.
mr.
david
r.
normann
oh,
yes.
yes,
article
2315
was
on
the
books
long
before
then.
i
think
originally
in
the
code
1825.
it
has
been
amended
seven
times
since
it
was
first
enacted
and
i
believe
mr.
fortas
has
made
the
point
yesterday
that
in
all
of
the
amendments.
well,
he
described
the
amendments
i
believe
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
the
next
point
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
next
point
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
it
is
as
i
said
the
basis
of
our
tort
law.
it
provides
for
wrongful
death
and
it
is
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
i
think
that's
fair
state
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
right.
and
i
think
--
i
think
that's
fair
statement
to
protect
the
claims
of
legitimates
against
those
of
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
correct.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
the
statute
you
calling
already
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
the
definition
section
of
a
statute
--
of
our
code,
article
3556
to
find
children
as
meet
whatever
used
in
the
code
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
as
meaning
legitimate
children.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
if
i
did,
i
stand
corrected.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
that
the
statute
has
simple
purposes.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
most
certain
i
have
so
argued
just
a
moment
ago.
but
i
do
think
that
an
important
purpose
of
this
statute
originally
was
to
protect
property
rights
as
the
court
has
also
observed.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
would
answer
that
your
honor
by
saying,
i
don't
think
the
interest
to
the
state
is
in
protecting
the
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
who
is
it
protecting
in
this
case?
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
think
it's
protecting
the
right
of
legitimates
against
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
not
necessary
---
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
as
the
court
observed,
yesterday,
there
maybe
in
this
instance
no
legitimate
heirs
and
in
that
instance
most
certainly
the
tortfeasor
goes
free,
so
to
speak.
but
i
certainly
don't
think
that
was
the
intention
of
the
statute
to
protect
the
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
don't
believe
i
did
give
it
an
interpretation,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
don't
believe
i
did
give
it
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
interpret
it
as
a
means
to
protecting
a
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
mr.
david
r.
normann
correct.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
think
that
leads
though
to
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
i
say,
i
don't
consider
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
tortfeasor.
for
example
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
i
think
if
i
said
that
i
was
misunderstood.
i
stated
it
incorrectly
then.
i
say
that
it
is
--
i
argued
a
moment
ago,
that
there
is
a
moral
purpose
in
the
statute.
i
simply
acknowledge
that
there
is
also
a
strong
motivation
to
protect
property
rights.
but
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
rights
of
legitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
rights
of
legitimates.
the
property
rights
of
legitimates
as
against
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
not
to
take
away
all
the
right
to
illegitimacy
but
if
the
child
remains
illegitimate
then
under
the
rule
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
child
is
in
fact
illegitimate
and
has
not
been
legitimated
under
one
of
the
sections
that
i
just
read
then
that
child
has
no
standing
or
in
this
case
that
parent
has
no
standing.
i
think
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
and
i
know
when
it
was
passed.
i
have
with
me
the
code
with
the
amendments
through
1920.
it
appears
there
and
with
a
footnote
which
describes
the
previous
article
of
the
code
of
1870,
so
i
can
say
that
it
was
at
least
in
the
1870
code.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
might
say,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
protecting
the
idea
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
wrong
doer
--
protecting
the
wrong
doing
not
the
rights
but
from
his
culpable
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
i
mentioned
this
just
briefly
yesterday
before
we
adjourned,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
its
classification
coed
legitimates
and
illegitimates
then
it
must
also
be
unconstitutional
in
its
classification
coed
children
and
spouse
first,
parents
next,
brothers
and
sisters
third.
now,
if
i
am
killed
wrongfully,
my
parents
are
denied
a
cause
of
action
for
my
death
because
of
the
existence
of
my
children.
under
the
reasoning
of
petitioners,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
same
argument
could
be
made
that
my
parents
are
discriminated
against.
now,
why
does
the
law
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
must
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
of
course,
i
am
defending
the
rights
of
my
client
under
the
law
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
surely.
most
certainly
and
i'm
defending
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
mr.
david
r.
normann
but
the
state's
law
is
under
attack
here.
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
i'm
defending
the
state's
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
does
not
cover
the
right
of
action
or
cause
of
action
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
of
illegitimates,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
not
really,
your
honor.
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
illustrate
to
the
court
the
fact
that
louisiana's
wrongful
death
statute
is
tied
in
with
louisiana's
laws
of
inheritance.
mr.
david
r.
normann
alright,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
may
i
say
this,
the
reason
that
i
do
that
is
because
as
i
understand
the
law
so
as
not
to
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
right
to
classify
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
must
show
a
reasonable
purpose
in
doing
this,
in
denying
this
right
to
illegitimates.
now,
i
say
this
is
tied
up
with
the
law
of
inheritance
in
louisiana.
hence,
the
illustration
i
gave
a
moment
ago.
louisiana
also
classifies
in
its
hierarchy
who
has
the
cause
of
action
even
among
legitimates.
my
children
exclude
my
parents
for
my
wrongful
death.
mr.
david
r.
normann
true.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
it's
most
difficult
it
seems
to
me
for
the
law
to
cover
every
conceivable
circumstance.
i
think
--
i
personally
believe
that
the
louisiana
law
is
sound
in
this
area.
incidentally,
under
our
law,
he
is
not
entirely
free
of
all
responsibility.
i
didn't
go
into
these
code
or
articles
because
i
don't
really
feel
that
they're
really
relevant
to
the
issues
but
for
example,
the
culpable
man
in
that
instance,
in
that
example
would
owe
support
to
these
illegitimate
children
but
it
is
true
that
our
law
would
protect
the
rights
of
the
legitimates
against
the
claim
of
the
illegitimates.
but
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
and
that
is
why
i
am
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
this
is
so
intrinsically
tied
in
with
our
laws
of
inheritance
and
that
is
why
i
use
the
example
of
the
classifications
within
article
2315
themselves.
why
does
the
law
so
classify?
obviously,
because
our
law
recognizes
the
obligation
in
the
example
i
used
to
myself
to
support
my
children
and
louisiana's
wrongful
death
statute
follows
right
along
and
does
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
he
is
illegitimate.
this
would
be
an
illegitimate
relationship.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
correct.
that
is
the
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
right.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
the
death
of
the
illegitimate.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
the
spouse
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
because
he
--
the
--
that
wouldn't
be
if
it's
a
valid
marriage
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right;
the
wife
under
2315
has
a
cause
of
action
for
this
death.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
if
he
is
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
the
illegitimate's
mother
and
father
were
not
married
and
produced
another
child
from
that
same
union.
i
don't
consider
that
the
collaterals
are
legitimate
coed
each
other.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
the
law
does
not
provide
that
if
they
are
legitimate
relation
you
may
claim
this.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
r.
normann
under
the
facts
of
this
case
as
established
by
the
pleadings
remember
that
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
r.
normann
in
the
absence
of
a
legal
relationship,
no
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
david
r.
normann
but
i
must
--
i
only
know
the
facts
as
they
were
alleged
in
the
petition
your
honor
because
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
the
family
status
of
this
decedent
was
not
developed
because
it
only
came
up
beyond
his
mother
who
asserted
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
he
had
a
lawful
wife
she
would
have
the
cause
of
action
and
we
would
not
escape
liability.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
would
say
that
louisiana
has
the
right
to
assert
in
its
legislation,
what
it
believes
is
proper
to
protect
the
morals
of
its
people
subject
of
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
subject
of
course
to
review
by
this
court.
i
certainly
recognize
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
because
it
obviously
has
no
reasonable
purpose
precisely.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
sir.
i'm
afraid
that
would
be
just
as
offensive.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
david
r.
normann
may
it
please
court.
mr.
david
r.
normann
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor,
is
that
she
could
not.
she
could
not
maintain
the
action
either
for
the
survival
action
nor
can
she
maintain
it
for
the
course
of
action.
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
has
been
said
in
the
case
preceding
ours
and
as
well
as
in
this
case
where
the
issues
are
related
although
the
factual
situation
is
different,
i
can
afford
to
limit
my
remarks
just
to
the
fundamental
issue
and
perhaps
attempt
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
post
by
opposing
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
that
basically,
if
the
louisiana
law
is
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
its
classification
of
illegitimates
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
bring
the
action
for
the
death
of
the
legitimate,
it
must
follow
that
this
is
so
with
respect
to
any
law
which
so
classifies
illegitimates
and
which
would
deny
any
type
of
right
of
action
or
any
right
of
inheritance
to
them.
for
example,
in
those
states
which
do
allow
any
illegitimate
to
inherit
from
the
mother
but
not
from
the
father,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
situation
would
be
just
as
unconstitutional
as
the
louisiana
situation
if
the
louisiana
law
is
unconstitutional.
i
believe
if
i
understood
him
right
that
counsel
acknowledges
that
position
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court.
it
also
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
perhaps,
if
the
law
so
provided
and
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
louisiana
law
does
not
so
provide
it.
adopted
children
in
louisiana
say
--
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
legitimate
children.
now,
it
also
seems
to
me
your
honors
that
as
counsels
has
pointed
out,
article
2315
of
our
civil
code
embodies
our
general
tort
law
and
also
is
our
wrongful
death
statute.
and
article
2315
sets
up
various
classifications
in
a
hierarchy
as
to
who
has
a
right
of
action
and
one
class
exclude
the
others.
for
example,
wife
and
children
exclude
parents.
in
the
absence
of
a
spouse,
surviving
spouse
and
children,
then
the
parents
have
the
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
absence
of
either
of
those,
then
brothers
and
sisters
have
the
cause
of
action.
and
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
if
it
is
wrong
to
classify,
if
it
is
unconstitutional
to
classify
with
respect
to
illegitimates,
it
may
be
just
as
wrong
to
classify
in
the
categories
that
i
have
just
amplified.
and
i
also
submit,
although
i
cannot
cite
authority
to
support
this
point
that
i
would
imagine
every
state
in
the
union
has
at
least
a
similar
classification
with
respect
to
who
may
maintain
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
provided
--
yes,
provided
that
there
is
a
legitimate
relation.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
answer
factually
the
question
because
the
court
had
never
reached
that
in
the
local
district.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
that
may
be.
in
this
instance,
i'm
probably
incorrect
of
saying
that
they
could.
i
can't
at
the
moment
conceive
about
a
good
one.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
the
father
can
legitimate
a
child.
he
can
acknowledge
a
child,
you
mean
under
louisiana
law?
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
he
would
also
be
illegitimate
coed
this
decedent.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
brother
was
illegitimate
coed,
this
decedent
no,
not
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
insofar
as
the
father's
concerned,
yes,
sir.
louisiana
law
has
set
a
various
means
for
legitimizing
illegitimates.
i
think
this
point
has
been
made
perhaps
in
the
levy
case.
mr.
david
r.
normann
one,
your
honor,
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
the
parents.
louisiana
law,
i
submit,
is
rather
liberal
in
this
respect.
article
198
of
the
civil
code
provides,
“children
born
out
of
marriage,
except
those
who
are
born
from
an
incestuous
connection,
are
legitimated
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
their
father
and
mother
whenever
the
latter
have
formally
or
informally
acknowledge
them
for
their
children
either
before
or
after
the
marriage”
and
by
a
1948
amendment,
this
includes
adulterous
bastards.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
david
r.
normann
that
may
be
your
honor
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
understand
the
argument
that
counsel
is
now
making
incidentally
attempted
to
make
this
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
was
denied
the
right
since
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
there
and
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
i
understand
the
argument
to
be
that
since
this
lady,
this
petitioner
resided
in
texas,
these
things
would
have
had
been
done
in
texas.
i
can't
answer
that
except
to
say
yes,
of
course,
that's
correct
or
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
pointed
out,
adoption
proceedings
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
child
was
legitimated
in
texas,
the
cause
of
action
exists
in
louisiana.
mr.
david
r.
normann
precisely.
for
example,
common
law
marriages
are
not
recognized
in
louisiana
but
if
common
law
marriages
are
recognized
in
texas
and
that
person
moves
to
louisiana,
all
those
persons
moved
to
louisiana,
those
marriages
is
perfectly
valid
in
louisiana.
mr.
david
r.
normann
may
it
please
the
court.
subsequent
to
yesterday's
adjournment,
i
realized
that
while
in
our
case
and
in
the
previous
case,
we
have
been
discussing
article
2315
of
the
louisiana
civil
code
which
is
our
tort
law
and
provides
for
our
wrongful
death
statute
that
we
had
not
as
yet
read
it
to
the
court
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful,
it's
not
very
long,
if
i
read
it.
it
provides
as
follows;
every
act
whatever
of
man
that
causes
damage
to
another
obliges
him
by
whose
fault
it
happened
to
repair
it.
the
right
to
recover
damages
to
property
caused
by
an
offense
or
quasi-offense
is
a
property
right
which
on
the
death
of
the
obligees
inherited
by
his
legal
instituted
or
irregular
as
subject
to
the
community
rights
of
the
surviving
spouse.
the
right
to
recover
all
other
damages
caused
by
an
offense
or
quasi-offense,
if
the
injured
person
dies,
shall
survive
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
favor
of
one,
the
surviving
spouse
and
child
or
children
of
the
deceased
or
either
such
spouse
or
such
child
or
children;
two,
the
surviving
father
and
mother
of
the
deceased
or
either
of
them
if
he
left
no
spouse
or
child
surviving;
and
three,
the
surviving
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
deceased
or
any
of
them
if
he
left
no
spouse
child
or
parents
survived.
the
survivors
in
whose
favor
this
right
of
action
survives
may
also
recover
for
damages
which
they
sustained
through
the
wrongful
death
of
the
deceased.
a
right
to
recover
damages
under
the
provisions
of
this
paragraph
is
a
property
right
which
on
the
death
of
the
survivor
in
whose
favor
the
right
of
action
survive
is
inherited
by
his
legal
instituted
or
irregular
as
whether
suit
has
been
instituted
thereon
by
the
survivor
or
not.
as
used
in
this
article,
the
words
“child,
brother,
sister,
father,
and
mother”
include
a
child,
brother,
sister,
father
and
mother
by
adoption
respectively.
as
i
say,
that
is
the
basis
for
all
louisiana
tort
law
as
well
as
our
wrongful
death
statute.
i
feel
satisfied
that
the
court
recognizes
that
this
case
does
not
in
any
way
involved
the
racial
issue
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
mentioned
in
my
opponent's
brief.
consequently,
it
seems
that
the
question
with
which
the
court
is
presented
is
this,
has
louisiana
in
classifying
legitimates
and
illegitimates
acted
reasonably
and
in
accord
with
the
--
a
legitimate
purpose
of
its
statutes
so
as
not
to
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
i
submit
of
course
that
we
have
acted
reasonably
for
these
four
reasons.
one,
louisiana
has
exercised
its
legal
right
to
legislate
in
areas
which
affect
the
health,
morals
and
general
welfare
of
its
citizens.
two,
most
certainly
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
sanctity
of
legitimate
relationships
as
produced
through
lawful
marriage.
third,
louisiana
exercises
its
right
to
legislate
so
as
to
preserve
the
family
unit.
and
fourth,
louisiana
has
enacted
specific
and
very
liberal
legislation
to
permit
the
legitimation
of
illegitimates.
thereby
conferring
on
them
all
rights
enjoyed
by
legitimates.discussing
this
briefly
in
the
order
mentioned
that
is
first,
the
right
to
legislate
in
areas
affecting
health,
morals
and
general
welfare.
this
court
has
recognized
in
sanction
the
right
of
a
state
to
enact
such
laws
including
the
right
to
legislate
of
the
area
of
sexual
conduct.
it
was
so
stated
in
mclaughlin
versus
state
of
florida.
the
federal
government
in
all
of
the
states
had
exercised
a
right.
hence,
the
department
of
public
welfare
of
united
states
government
and
the
ordinance
is
the
smallest
township
regulating
and
seeking
to
control
such
things
as
tuberculosis,
venereal
decease.
all
operate
in
the
same
area
and
all
of
these
we
submit
are
entirely
constitutional.
the
criminal
statutes
punishing
illicit
and
unnatural
sexual
conduct
are
also
proper
examples.
the
sanctity
of
maintaining
legitimate
relationships
through
lawful
marriage
while
bearing
from
state
to
state,
every
state
in
the
union
exercises
his
right.
and
i
don't
believe
anyone
would
seriously
question
the
right
or
indeed
the
duty
of
the
state
to
do
so.legislation
designed
to
preserve
a
family
unit.
perhaps
this
court's
holding
in
the
case
of
murphy
versus
ramsey,
states
it
most
delinquently.
the
court
held
certainly
no
legislation
can
be
supposed
more
wholesome
and
necessary
in
the
founding
of
a
free,
self-governing
commonwealth,
and
that
would
seeks
to
establish
it
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
the
family
has
consisting
in
and
springing
from
the
union
for
life
of
one
man
and
one
woman
in
the
holy
state
of
matrimony,
the
sure
foundation
of
all
that
it
is
stable
and
noble
in
our
civilization;
and
finally,
the
legislation
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
allow
the
legitimation
of
illegitimates.
here,
we
respectfully
submit
louisiana
has
gone
quite
far
and
perhaps
has
excelled.
the
history
of
our
state's
law
has
been
one
of
constinent
--
constant
broadening
of
this
concept.
thus,
article
198
of
our
civil
code
provides
children
born
out
of
marriage
except
those
who
are
born
from
his
ancestors'
connection
are
legitimated
by
the
subsequent
marriage
of
the
father
and
mother.
whenever
the
latter
have
formally
or
informally
acknowledge
them
for
their
children
either
before
or
after
the
marriage.
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
by
1948
amendment,
this
article
includes
adulterous
bastards.
article
200
of
our
civil
code,
provides
an
unnatural
father
or
mother
may
legitimate
his
or
her
natural
children
by
a
notarial
act
signed
by
two
witnesses
declaring
the
intention
of
a
parent
to
legitimate
such
child
or
children.
article
214
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
either
the
father
or
the
mother.
article
214,
provides
for
adoption
and
the
rights
pursuant
that
too,
and
puts
adopted
children
on
the
same
basis
as
legitimates.
adopted
children
are
included
as
forced
as
under
louisiana
succession
laws,
in
the
levy
case.
the
louisiana
doctrine
of
forced
heirship
i
believe
was
explained
to
the
court.
louisiana
revised
statute
9391
provides
the
authority
for
natural
mothers
and
fathers
to
adopt
their
natural
children
by
notarial
acts.
we
thus
submit
that
louisiana
has
acted
more
than
reasonably
in
the
classification
which
is
here
under
attack.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
we're
--
are
you
speaking
now
of
article
2315,
the
tort
statute?
mr.
david
r.
normann
1907
was
the
first
holding
that
a
mother
in
the
same
situation
we
have
here
your
honors,
a
mother
was
suing
for
the
death
of
her
child,
lynch
versus
knoop
is
the
case.
mr.
david
r.
normann
oh,
yes.
yes,
article
2315
was
on
the
books
long
before
then.
i
think
originally
in
the
code
1825.
it
has
been
amended
seven
times
since
it
was
first
enacted
and
i
believe
mr.
fortas
has
made
the
point
yesterday
that
in
all
of
the
amendments.
well,
he
described
the
amendments
i
believe
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
the
next
point
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
next
point
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
it
is
as
i
said
the
basis
of
our
tort
law.
it
provides
for
wrongful
death
and
it
is
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
i
think
that's
fair
state
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
right.
and
i
think
--
i
think
that's
fair
statement
to
protect
the
claims
of
legitimates
against
those
of
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
correct.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
the
statute
you
calling
already
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
the
definition
section
of
a
statute
--
of
our
code,
article
3556
to
find
children
as
meet
whatever
used
in
the
code
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
as
meaning
legitimate
children.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
if
i
did,
i
stand
corrected.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
that
the
statute
has
simple
purposes.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
most
certain
i
have
so
argued
just
a
moment
ago.
but
i
do
think
that
an
important
purpose
of
this
statute
originally
was
to
protect
property
rights
as
the
court
has
also
observed.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
would
answer
that
your
honor
by
saying,
i
don't
think
the
interest
to
the
state
is
in
protecting
the
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
who
is
it
protecting
in
this
case?
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
think
it's
protecting
the
right
of
legitimates
against
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
not
necessary
---
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
as
the
court
observed,
yesterday,
there
maybe
in
this
instance
no
legitimate
heirs
and
in
that
instance
most
certainly
the
tortfeasor
goes
free,
so
to
speak.
but
i
certainly
don't
think
that
was
the
intention
of
the
statute
to
protect
the
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
don't
believe
i
did
give
it
an
interpretation,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
don't
believe
i
did
give
it
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
didn't
interpret
it
as
a
means
to
protecting
a
tortfeasor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
mr.
david
r.
normann
correct.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
think
that
leads
though
to
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
i
say,
i
don't
consider
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
tortfeasor.
for
example
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
i
think
if
i
said
that
i
was
misunderstood.
i
stated
it
incorrectly
then.
i
say
that
it
is
--
i
argued
a
moment
ago,
that
there
is
a
moral
purpose
in
the
statute.
i
simply
acknowledge
that
there
is
also
a
strong
motivation
to
protect
property
rights.
but
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
rights
of
legitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
the
rights
of
legitimates.
the
property
rights
of
legitimates
as
against
illegitimates.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
not
to
take
away
all
the
right
to
illegitimacy
but
if
the
child
remains
illegitimate
then
under
the
rule
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
the
child
is
in
fact
illegitimate
and
has
not
been
legitimated
under
one
of
the
sections
that
i
just
read
then
that
child
has
no
standing
or
in
this
case
that
parent
has
no
standing.
i
think
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
and
i
know
when
it
was
passed.
i
have
with
me
the
code
with
the
amendments
through
1920.
it
appears
there
and
with
a
footnote
which
describes
the
previous
article
of
the
code
of
1870,
so
i
can
say
that
it
was
at
least
in
the
1870
code.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
might
say,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
protecting
the
idea
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
wrong
doer
--
protecting
the
wrong
doing
not
the
rights
but
from
his
culpable
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
i
mentioned
this
just
briefly
yesterday
before
we
adjourned,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
its
classification
coed
legitimates
and
illegitimates
then
it
must
also
be
unconstitutional
in
its
classification
coed
children
and
spouse
first,
parents
next,
brothers
and
sisters
third.
now,
if
i
am
killed
wrongfully,
my
parents
are
denied
a
cause
of
action
for
my
death
because
of
the
existence
of
my
children.
under
the
reasoning
of
petitioners,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
same
argument
could
be
made
that
my
parents
are
discriminated
against.
now,
why
does
the
law
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
must
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
normann
of
course,
i
am
defending
the
rights
of
my
client
under
the
law
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
surely.
most
certainly
and
i'm
defending
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
mr.
david
r.
normann
but
the
state's
law
is
under
attack
here.
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
i'm
defending
the
state's
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
does
not
cover
the
right
of
action
or
cause
of
action
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
of
illegitimates,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
not
really,
your
honor.
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
illustrate
to
the
court
the
fact
that
louisiana's
wrongful
death
statute
is
tied
in
with
louisiana's
laws
of
inheritance.
mr.
david
r.
normann
alright,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
and
may
i
say
this,
the
reason
that
i
do
that
is
because
as
i
understand
the
law
so
as
not
to
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
right
to
classify
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
must
show
a
reasonable
purpose
in
doing
this,
in
denying
this
right
to
illegitimates.
now,
i
say
this
is
tied
up
with
the
law
of
inheritance
in
louisiana.
hence,
the
illustration
i
gave
a
moment
ago.
louisiana
also
classifies
in
its
hierarchy
who
has
the
cause
of
action
even
among
legitimates.
my
children
exclude
my
parents
for
my
wrongful
death.
mr.
david
r.
normann
true.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
it's
most
difficult
it
seems
to
me
for
the
law
to
cover
every
conceivable
circumstance.
i
think
--
i
personally
believe
that
the
louisiana
law
is
sound
in
this
area.
incidentally,
under
our
law,
he
is
not
entirely
free
of
all
responsibility.
i
didn't
go
into
these
code
or
articles
because
i
don't
really
feel
that
they're
really
relevant
to
the
issues
but
for
example,
the
culpable
man
in
that
instance,
in
that
example
would
owe
support
to
these
illegitimate
children
but
it
is
true
that
our
law
would
protect
the
rights
of
the
legitimates
against
the
claim
of
the
illegitimates.
but
i
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
and
that
is
why
i
am
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
this
is
so
intrinsically
tied
in
with
our
laws
of
inheritance
and
that
is
why
i
use
the
example
of
the
classifications
within
article
2315
themselves.
why
does
the
law
so
classify?
obviously,
because
our
law
recognizes
the
obligation
in
the
example
i
used
to
myself
to
support
my
children
and
louisiana's
wrongful
death
statute
follows
right
along
and
does
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
he
is
illegitimate.
this
would
be
an
illegitimate
relationship.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
correct.
that
is
the
law.
mr.
david
r.
normann
that's
right.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no.
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
the
death
of
the
illegitimate.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes.
the
spouse
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
because
he
--
the
--
that
wouldn't
be
if
it's
a
valid
marriage
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right;
the
wife
under
2315
has
a
cause
of
action
for
this
death.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
if
he
is
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
the
illegitimate's
mother
and
father
were
not
married
and
produced
another
child
from
that
same
union.
i
don't
consider
that
the
collaterals
are
legitimate
coed
each
other.
mr.
david
r.
normann
well,
the
law
does
not
provide
that
if
they
are
legitimate
relation
you
may
claim
this.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
r.
normann
under
the
facts
of
this
case
as
established
by
the
pleadings
remember
that
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
r.
normann
in
the
absence
of
a
legal
relationship,
no
sir.
there
is
none.
mr.
david
r.
normann
but
i
must
--
i
only
know
the
facts
as
they
were
alleged
in
the
petition
your
honor
because
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
the
family
status
of
this
decedent
was
not
developed
because
it
only
came
up
beyond
his
mother
who
asserted
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
r.
normann
if
he
had
a
lawful
wife
she
would
have
the
cause
of
action
and
we
would
not
escape
liability.
mr.
david
r.
normann
i
would
say
that
louisiana
has
the
right
to
assert
in
its
legislation,
what
it
believes
is
proper
to
protect
the
morals
of
its
people
subject
of
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
--
subject
of
course
to
review
by
this
court.
i
certainly
recognize
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
david
r.
normann
yes,
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
because
it
obviously
has
no
reasonable
purpose
precisely.
mr.
david
r.
normann
no,
sir.
i'm
afraid
that
would
be
just
as
offensive.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
