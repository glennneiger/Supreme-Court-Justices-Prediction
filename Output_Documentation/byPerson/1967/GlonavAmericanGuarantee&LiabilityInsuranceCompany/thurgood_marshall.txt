and
you
have
here
--
and
you
have
here
in
the
rule
that
says
that
anybody
who
doesn't
bother
to
have
his
marriage
or
recognition
of
the
children
legitimatized
shall
not
collect,
put
on
the
burden
on
the
person.
now,
in
hirabayashi,
it
was
very
little
that
the
japanese
could
do
about
that.
and
the
negro
marriage
case
is
very
little
to
negro
to
do
by
his
race.
but
here,
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
be
--
go
before
a
notary
and
she
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.

thurgood
marshall

assume
they
could
have

justice
thurgood
marshall
but

point
is
that
she
was
not
required
to
understand
that
louisiana
had
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
