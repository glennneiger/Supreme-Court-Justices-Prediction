et

mr.
normann,
i
think
you
were
conducting
your
argument,
were
you
not?
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
state
interest
would
there
be
in
protecting
a
tort
reserve
who
has
killed
a
child
from
compensating
the
mother
for
the
loss
of
that
child
even
though
the
child
happened
to
be
illegitimate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
who
is
it
protecting
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
precisely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it's
protecting
--
it's
protecting
this
insurance
company,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
against
liability
for
having
killed
his
child?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
do
you
give
that
interpretation
that
wasn't
the
intention?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
interpretation
of
your
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
you're
arguing
here
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
represent
the
insurance
carrier
for
the
tortfeasor,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
want
to
absolve
him
from
any
liability
even
though
his
policy
holder
may
have
killed
his
child?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
did
it
in
a
tortuous
way
that
the
mother
is
being
deprived
of
any
compensation
from
him
not
from
a
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
thing
if
a
state
goes
wants
protect
the
legitimacy
and
to
protect
families.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
got
another
issue
here,
if
you're
trying
to
protect
the
tortfeasor
for
having
killed
the
child.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
also
told
justice
fortas
that
it
wasn't
for
any
moral
purpose
that
this
was
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whose
property
rights
they
want
to
protect
in
the
case
of
tortfeasor
who
kills
the
child?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
to
take
away
all
the
rights
of
illegitimacy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
--
you're
not
dealing
here
with
parents
the
relationship
of
parents
and
child
or
any
family
relationship.
you're
not
here
dealing
with
any
relationship
between
the
state
and
this
child.
you
are
here
arguing
as
a
representative
of
an
insurance
company
of
one
of
its
clients
who
has
killed
the
child
and
used
this
statute
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
your
client
of
any
responsibility
for
it.
that's
your
purpose
here
not
to
defend
the
state's
right
to
deal
with
the
family
problem,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
representing
the
insurance
company,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
his
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
are
interpreting
family
law
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
liability
for
tortious
acts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
your
qualm
says
that
these
laws
do
not
cover
the
torts
of
this
kind.
they
are
not
designed
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
seems
so
taken
the
whole
term
that
you're
defending
the
honor
and
morals
--
morals
of
the
state
in
depriving
a
mother
of
a
child
for
the
tortious
death
of
her
child.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
did
--
now,
what
specific
act
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
come
to
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
that
result
of
this
case,
if
you
win,
is
that
not
only
your
insurance
company
but
everyone
in
the
state
of
louisiana
can
kill
an
illegitimate
child
and
suffer
no
responsibility
financial
responsibility
of
any
kind
to
anyone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
answer
is
yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
who
--
who
might
you
be
liable
to
in
this
case,
if
you
win?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
whatever
way
it
come
up
is
there
any
respond
--
financial
responsibility
to
any
one
if
you
win?
chief
justice
earl

well,
i'm
taking
the
facts
as
they
are
