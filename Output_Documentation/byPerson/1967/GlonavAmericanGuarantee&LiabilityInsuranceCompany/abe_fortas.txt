justice
abe
fortas
does
texas
impose
any
disabilities
on
illegitimate
children
because
of
their
illegitimacy?
justice
abe
fortas
not
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
there
be
a
legitimate
relation?
what
would
that
be?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
had
an
opportunity
to
go
into
the
history
of
this
provision
of
louisiana's
treatment
of
illegitimate
children?
i
understand
that
the
antecedents
of
this
statute
go
pretty
far
back
in
louisiana's
history,
is
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
what
date
when
you
first
appeared
in
louisiana
law?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
state
was
that
--
the
statute
was
on
the
books
before
then
or
what
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
history
of
the
statute
that
indicates
its
original
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
original
--
its
original
purpose
was
property
purpose,
was
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
not
a
moral
purpose.
it
was
a
property
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
that
part
of
it.
i
mean
to
say
the
distinction
between
illegitimate
and
legitimate
children
in
2315
and
elsewhere
in
louisiana
law?
justice
abe
fortas
wasn't
it
originally
a
property
distinction
designed
to
keep
a
property
within
the
channels
of
legitimacy
that
is
to
say
the
order
recognized
to
establish
family
pattern.
although,
there
might
be
other
sort
of
quasi-family
arrangements
except
in
the
legal
sense
apart
from
the
legitimate
family
arrangement.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
a
property
arrangement
–-
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
originally
an
arrangement
designed
to
protect
public
morals?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
you
know
make
any
distinction
as
among
your
children.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
a
problem
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
haven't
--
it's
occurred
that
and
it's
perfectly
possible
to
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
these
statutes
making
this
distinction
against
illegitimate
children
is
profoundly
immoral,
at
least
choosing
the
conventional
terminology,
because
what
they
do
is
to
insolate
the
male
member
or
head
of
the
household
from
the
consequences
of
immoral
conduct
outside
of
the
family
structure
that
is
to
say
the
father
of
the
household
can
create
another
set
of
children
without
any
danger
that
the
other
set
of
children
will
have
competing
claims
on
the
family
estate.
the
morality
of
this
--
these
statutes
particularly
when
viewed
in
light
of
their
history
and
as
i
understand
it
there
is
not
quite
as
simple
and
clear
as
perhaps
appears
on
the
circus,
would
you
disagree
with
that?
that
is
to
say
you
take
and
originally
these
statutes
were
passed
to
protect
the
legitimate
family,
protect
the
property
interest
of
the
legitimate
family.
and
to
some
extent,
they
encourage
if
one
wants
to
indulge
in
that
kind
of
reasoning
the
head
of
the
household
to
go
out
and
establish
another
family
elsewhere.
and
he
didn't
have
to
have
any
fear
at
all
that
the
children
of
the
--
to
use
a
spanish
expression
the
“casa
media”
with
the
assert
competing
claims
as
against
the
children
of
the
original
--
of
the
legitimate
family.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
is
relevant.
what
we're
talking
about
here
it's
maybe
irrelevant
because
what
you
have
to
do
as
you
have
said
is
to
defend
this
as
a
reasonable
classification.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
go
always
involves
the
question
of
the
purpose
and
whether
it
is
a
--
and
what
is
the
real
purpose
of
the
classification.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
--
what
exactly
–
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
couldn't
very
well
to
say
that
no
blue
eyed
children
can
inherit,
could
it
