she
could
have
adopted
it

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
before
you
leave?
do
i
understand
from
you
that
under
the
laws
of
texas
it
has
never,
there
has
never
been
any
difference
in
property
rights,
the
right
to
inheritance,
the
right
to
acquire
between
the
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
laws
of
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
from
the
father?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
many
of
the
states
of
the
union
are
illegitimate
children
allowed
to
inherit
from
their
father?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
in
which
they
are
allowed
to
inherit
from
their
father;
illegitimate
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

if
you
would
cite
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

inherit
from
their
father.
you
might
though
rely
on
the
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
that
if
they
have
them
why
they
cannot
inherit
from
their
father,
the
same
argument
would
apply
to
the
laws
of
those
states,
wasn't
it,
as
would
apply
here
if
we
would
hold
the
louisiana
law
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
be
no
more
ground
for
knocking
at
the
father,
the
father's
illegitimate
children
and
mother's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
irrelevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
state
in
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
state
in
the
union
has
the
right
to
pass
laws
that
will
forbid
handicaps
of
recovery
by
inheritance
on
the
children
because
they
are
illegitimate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
(voice
overlap)
of
a
right
by
the
state
--
the
state
law
provides
a
difference
between
the
right
of
the
illegitimate
child
to
inherit
and
the
right
of
an
illegitimate.
i
understand
you
say
that
wholly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
think
it's
irrelevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
state
can
pass
a
law
based
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
how
you
could
answer
the
question
of
brother
fortas
as
you
did.
would
you
--
what
do
you
say
and
if
the
children
the
people
were
not
interested
in
the
moral
idea
of
having
children
legitimate
and
of
doing
something
to
block
it
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
such
as
relationships
where
there
is
no
marriage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
no
moral
compose,
no
moral
motive?
i
don't
know
how
you
could
deal
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
louisiana
to
make
lawful
loss
has
the
power
to
determine
what
it
believes
to
be
moral
or
instead
of
that
if
this
court
has
the
right
to
determine
its
laws
then
an
unconstitutional
because
the
court
believes
it's
immoral?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
question
of
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
marbury
and
madison?
justice
hugo
l.

so
far
as
the
marbury

goes?
