mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
indeed
presented
his
argument
with
great
candor
today.
the
fact
remains
that
robert
rowe
and
clyde
thacker
are
in
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
for
50
and
64
years
respectively.
they
assert
that
substantial
portions
of
this
term
are
unconstitutional
and
they
ask
a
federal
hearing
and
adjudication
on
their
claims.
they
don't
ask
they'd
be
released
totally
from
custody.
they
ask
only
that
the
illegal
portions
of
the
custody
be
stricken
from
their
term.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
essential
illegality
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
alleged
in
both
cases
is
ineffective
as
representation
of
counsel.
i
think
that
is
the
essential
allegation
and
that
is
conceded
by
the
state
and
found
by
the
fourth
circuit
prima
facie
on
their
allegations
to
entitle
them
to
a
hearing
if
a
hearing
is
available.
i
think
it's
some
important
to
point
out
the
substantial
areas
of
agreement
between
the
respondent,
petitioners
and
the
state
and
to
reemphasize
what
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
has
stated
today.
that
is
we
all
agree
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
the
hearing
is
available;
that
they've
alleged
serious
defects
in
the
process
by
which
they
were
tried
and
convicted.
we
also
agree
that
the
claims
can
be
heard
and
adjudicated
most
effectively
now,
today.
not
in
1993
or
1994.
its
--
i
think
that
both
cases
would
require
a
substantial
testimony
by
witnesses.
in
mr.
rowe's
case,
he
alleges
in
that
case
that
his
lawyer
told
him
that
he
should
plead
guilty
to
a
charge
of
abduction
of
a
female
with
intend
to
defile
in
neighboring
city
of
stanton
because
even
though
it
already
been
convicted
in
the
city
of
waynesboro
for
rape
in
the
same
incident
and
sentenced
to
30
years,
than
any
sentence
imposed
upon
him
in
the
neighboring
city
would
have
to
run
concurrent
with
that
sentence.
so
i
think
that
in
order
to
prove—this
was
just
a
clear
mistake
when
the
virginia
law
and
judge
made
quite
clear
by
imposing
the
20-year
sentence
and
ordering
that
they
run
consecutively.
i
think
that
this
clearly
involved
a
necessity
of
calling
witnesses.
i
think
in
the
case
of
clyde
thacker,
the
evidentiary
problems
are
even
greater,
your
honor.
because
their
this
man
was
tried
for
house
breaking
that
were
allegedly
committed
1951,
‘52
and
'53.
he
was
already
in
custody
at
the
time
of
his
trial
on
other
convictions
and
he
alleges
that
when
he
was
removed
from
his
present
place
of
incarceration
and
brought
to
this
county,
that
the
lawyer
there
who
was
appointed
for
when
the
day
of
his
trial
said
“don't
worry,
i
can
get
the
sentences
suspended.”
which
in
fact
the
lawyer
did
and
let's
not
put
to
state
to
a
trouble
and
of
a
great
expense
of
trial
because
you're
going
to
be
in
jail
for
a
long
time
anyway,
and
this
sentences
will
just
run
or
be
suspended.
and
the
judge
in
fact
did
impose
three
to
five
year
sentences
to
run
consecutively
and
suspended
them
on
the
condition
of
good
behavior
for
50
years.
the
sentences
were
revoked
in
1956
upon
his
reconviction
for
another
crime.
and
they're
now
scheduled
for
service.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
suspension
was
revoked
and
so
he
is
now
scheduled
for
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
under
the
state
provision?
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
his
present
term
that's
un-attacked
here
would
run
out
in
1994
i
think,
your
honor.
both
there
one
is
1993
and
the
other
is
1994.
that
is
assuming
that
he
gets
full
credit
for
good
behavior
for
the
rest
of
his
term,
otherwise
it
won't
commence
until
the
year
2009.
so
i
think
that
we
do
agree
substantially
on
this
that
they're
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
that
the
hearing
is
necessary.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
they've
started
a
prim--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor;
that
if
absent
timeliness
problems,
that
if
this
allegations
were
made
in
district
court.
the
district
court
would
have
to
grant
some
hearing
under
rules
of
this
court.
the
third
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
i'd
reach
the
point
in
the
argument
where
i
wish
to
describe
what
responds
conceive
to
be
the
area
of
disagreement
between
the
prisoner
respondents
in
the
state
of
virginia.
that
area
of
disagreement
apparently
is
this
and
this
only,
and
that
is
the
state
takes
a
position
that
mcnally
versus
hill
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
historically
and
is
extended
to
prisoners
by
act
of
congress.
the
respondents,
the
prisoners
take
the
position
the
mcnally
versus
hill
was
an
incorrect
statement
and
of
the
meaning
of
the
writ.
that
the
writ
was
broader
in
this
historically
and
that
congress
did
not
limit
the
writ
in
any
of
its
enactment,
and
that
includes
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966
which
i
will
avert
in
a
few
moments.
i
also
would
like
to
address
myself
in
a
few
moments
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
reason
why
this
case
should
be
vacated
and
remanded
simply
because
the
state
of
virginia
has
agreed
to
provide
a
state
remedy
after
june
that
is
presuming
that
the
governor
signs
the
bill
into
law.
i
think
that
there
are
at
least
three
substantial
reasons
why
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
should
be
interpreted
in
this
context
more
broadly
that
they
we're
interpreted
in
mcnally
versus
hill.
again,
the
state
agrees
with
the
prisoners
as
to
one
these
reasons
at
least;
and
that
is
that
if
they're
going
to
have
to
the
full
unfair
fact
hearing,
granted
them
in
a
federal
court,
granted
them
by
townsend
versus
sane
if
they
have
not
had
a
full
unfair
fact
hearing
in
the
state
court.
it
must
be
now,
not
a
quarter
of
a
century
from
now.
secondly,
and
i
think
this
point
is
clear,
that
these
men
will
be
in
custody
will
be
in
iron
custody
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
for
the
quarter
of
a
century
between
now
and
the
time
under
mcnally
they're
eligible
to
attack
this
allegedly
unconstitutional
convictions.
if
in
1994
they
can
still
prove
their
claim,
which
i
think
is
highly
doubtful,
but
if
they
can
still
prove
their
claim,
our
experience
tells
that's
it
goig
to
take
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
get
through
the
state
courts
and
if
necessary
through
the
federal
court.
so
because
of
a
rule
of
timing,
these
men
who
perhaps
are
incarcerated
constitutionally
until
1994
will
have
to
remain
in
the
penitentiary,
pending
their
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
pending
a
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
grant
them
that
writ;
so
unnecessary
time
will
be
spent
in
prison.
i
think
we
always
regret
time
that
has
to
be
spent
in
prison
under
an
invalid
sentence.
most
often
we
can
not
correct,
that's
just
unnecessary
part
of
our
judicial
system
is
it
operates
now
in
granting
post-conviction
relief.
but
in
this
case,
it
can
be
corrected
if
the
rule
of
timing
in
mcnally
is
not
followed.
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
that
raise
the
point
raised
by
the
virginia
legislation
is
its
effect
on
this
proceeding
here.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
under
the
broad
terms
of
the
virginia
statute,
if
it
is
signed
by
the
governor,
they
will
be
eligible
to
apply
for
a
state
remedy.
i'd
like
to
make
several
points
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
bill
is
not
long
now.
secondly,
it
was
conceitedly
not
law
at
the
time
these
prisoners
entered
the
federal
court.
and
under
section
22-54
as
interpreted
in
fay
versus
noia,
as
as
interpreted
by
i
think
all
of
district
and
circuit
courts
since
the
exhaustion
requirement
means
you
must
exhaust
the
remedies
available
to
you
at
the
time
you
enter
the
federal
court.
these
remedies
were
not
available
to
them.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
i
am
working
on
that
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall
that
it
would
not
be—that
it
will
be
signed
before
this
court
hands
a
down
a
decision.
but
the
point
still
remains
that
the
question
is
exhaustion,
and
that
these
prisoners
exhausted
prior
to
entering
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
you
honor
i
think
the
no
--
answer
is
no
to
both
questions.
in
the
first
place,
the
virginia
remedy
would
not
become
available
until
june
28
no
matter
when
it
is
signed
by
the
governor.
in
the
second
place,
even
assuming
that
this
court's
decision
came
at
precisely
the
same
time,
the
question
presented
here
is
the
existence
of
a
federal
remedy.
now
as
to
at
least
one
of
these
prisoners,
clyde
thacker,
it
was
highly
questionable
that
even
if
the
virginia
statute
is
inactive
and
does
go
into
effect
prior
to
this
court's
decision
whether
he
will
have
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court.
for
this
reason
your
honors,
virginia
has
refused
to
follow
the
rule
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
when
a
man
alleges
and
his
counsel
was
appointed
on
or
before—shortly
before
the
day
of
his
trial,
that
he
has
the
burden—the
fourth
circuit
has
held
the
state
when
he
proves
that
has
burden
approving
that
he
wasn't
prejudiced
by
this
manifest
defect
in
the
state
process.
where
the
state
of
virginia
says
and
consistently
maintained
despite
reason
fourth
circuit
decisions
dealing
with
virginia
prisoners
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
prisoner
so
that
thacker
could
make
a
good
case
and
even
if
you
were
just
entering
the
federal
courts
for
the
first
time
in
june,
that
he
shouldn't
have
to
exhaust
the
state
remedy
because
there
isn't
any
available
remedy
even
under
the
new
timing.
so
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is
exhaustion.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
rowe
your
honor
does
make
the
base
of
the
allegation
that
his
counsel
was
ineffective
also.
he
does
not
allege
he
was
appointed
on
the
same
day.
under
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
coles
versus
peyton
which
was
decided
in
january
of
this
year.
the
state
arguably
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
his
allegations
of
ineffective
representation
of
counsel.
arguably
he
would,
so
arguably
at
least
rowe
wouldn't
have
an
adequate
state
remedy
even
after
the
virginia
statute
goes
into
effect.
and
your
honor,
as
counsel
for
state
of
virginia,
candidly
conceded,
it
will
not
answer
the
question
to
vacate
and
remand
these
cases
because
in
the
fourth
circuit
at
least,
the
court
has
unanimously
en
banc
taken
had
decided
that
there
is
a
federal
remedy
available
and
has
made
that
federal
available
at
least
in
the
states
in
the
fourth
circuit.
other
states
and
other
circuit
are
not
making
such
remedy
available
and
the
federal
court
do
not
make
a
federal
remedy
available
either.
so
i
think
even
this
case
is
of
great
importance
for
the
whole
administration
of
justice
in
this
area.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
there
is
substantial
reason
for
ruling
mcnally
in
this
case
and
in
any
case.
but
as
to
these
men,
they
have
done
what
the
act
of
congress
required
them
to
do.
they've
exhausted
their
state
remedies,
all
the
remedies
that
were
available
to
them;
to
remand
them,
to
the
state
process
now
when
its
arguable
that
there
isn't
even
an
effect
of
remedy
now
for
them,
even
after
the
statute
and
the
state.
i
do
not
think
answers
the
question
presented
by
this
case
and
that
is,
is
there
a
federal
remedy
for
these
men
or
if
the
state
of
virginia
decides
that
these
men
were
not
unconstitutionally
convicted.
do
they
then
have
to
wait
another
25
years
before
they
can
get
there
townsend
versus
sane
hearing
in
the
federal
court?
if
virginia
decides
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
that
these
men
should
be
remanded
to
total
custody
extending
pass
1994
under
the
rule
on
mcnally,
they
will
not
be
able
to
get
their
townsend
versus
sane
hearing
here.
and
i
think
your
honor
i
would
just
like
briefly
to
speak
to
the
effect
of
case
versus
nebraska
on
this
case.
case
arose
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
in
that
case,
the
remedy
asked
for
was
and
adjudications
of
the
failure
to
afford
state
habeas
corpus,
what
required
to
granting
some
kind
of
federal
relief
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
nebraska
granted
the
remedy
the
case,
i
think
clearly
became
moot.
that's
obviously
not
true
here
even
if
virginia
grants
a
state
of
remedy,
it
doesn't
answer
question
of
the
availability
of
the
federal
remedy.
i
think
there
is
a
third
reason,
a
third
substantial
reason
why
we
should
and
why
this
court
should
reconsider
mcnally
and
hold
that
these
men
are
in
custody
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
these
men
are
both
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary.
they
are
in
the
maximum
security
institution.
penologists
generally
talk
about
grades
of
custody
within
penal
institutions.
these
men
are
in
the
maximum
security
prison.
they
may
be
there
because
of
the
sentences
which
they
alleged
are
unconstitutional.
i
agree,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
but
then
there
really
is
no
record.
there
is
never
any
hearing
on
this
issue.
so
that
becomes
determinative
as
to
whether
or
not
these
men
are
actually
suffering
now
because
of
the
impact
to
these
sentences
and
that
is
the
only
way
this
case
can
be
determined
at
the
very
least.
the
men
are
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
present
impact
of
these
sentences.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i'm
asking
that
this
court
overrule
mcnally
because
it
was
not
a
correct
or
a
necessary
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
great
writ
historically
or
as
congress
made
it
available
to
prisoners
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i'm
not
sure
whether
mcnally
purported
to
base
itself
on
the
constitution.
i
think
mcnally
was
based
on
two
premises,
and
that
is
we
look
the
common
law
to
see
what
the
scope
of
the
writ
is,
but
then
we
must
look
to
the
act
of
congress;
we
must
look
to
the
statute
to
see
to
what
extent
congress
extended
the
historical
great
writ
to
prisoners.
so
i'd
say
it
was
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
you
honor.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
that
is
behind
this.
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
we
don't
rely
on
a
constitutional
provision
here.
we
could
rely
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
you
honor
i
think
i've
corrected
my
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
--
the
constitutional
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
we
might
look
to
the
suspension
clause
and
the
interaction
into
the
suspension
clause
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
suspension
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
be
suspended.
i
think
your
honor
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it's
not
necessary
though
to
reach
any
constitutional
question
here
because
i
think
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
another
way
which
obviates
the
necessity
for
reaching
any
constitutional
issue.
and
the
way
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
is
this
i
think
your
honors.
mcnally
was
based
on
three
premises
which
i
think
we
can
briefly
describe
as
this
that
only
iron
bar
custody
was
attackable
by
habeas
corpus,
no
other
restraints
on
liberty.
secondly,
that
the
applicant
must
assert
the
right
to
a
total
release
from
this
iron
bar
custody.
and
thirdly
that
he
must
assert
the
right
to
immediate
release,
immediate
total
discharge
from
iron
bar
custody.
mcnally
purported
to
find
the
necessity
for
such
an
interpretation
in
the
history
of
the
writ
at
common
law
and
in
the
congressional
statute
itself,
and
i
think
that
it's
correct
in
either
case.
even
at
that
time
and
certainly
not
now
when
the
parole,
the
probation
systems
are
so
much
more
developed
than
they
were
before.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
mcnally
--
that
upholding
the
mcnally
interpretation
and
that
is
that
saying
the
congress
said
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
only
available
on
these
circumstances,
raises
to
serious
constitutional
problems
to
which
you
have
averted.
but
i
don't
think
your
honor
again
that
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
point.
because
i
think
it's
quite
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
that
there
are
several
things
that
could
be
said
to
that.
in
the
first
place
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
point.
i
think
if
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
point,
it's
at
least
partially
come
down
against
mcnally.
i
refer
to
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966,
section
22-44.
and
in
that
section
to
22-44
b,
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966,
the
statute
now
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
courts
might
be
able
to
grant
release
from
custody
or
other
remedy
on
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
i
assume
that
that
was
to
conform
what
supervisions
in
the
preceding
habeas
corpus
sections
that
all
federal
court,
once
the
writ
is
supplied
for,
can
grant
that
relief
which
law
and
justice
requires.
so
your
honor
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
reaching
the
prime
issues
of
what
the
constitution
requires
of
the
great
writ.
what
the
circumstances
and
the
scope
which
the
constitution
requires
at
the
great
writ;
i
think
however
this
court
would
be
based
with
that
issue
squarely
unless
mcnally's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
reevaluated.
and
i
think
this
court
has
already
reevaluated
since
mcnally,
the
interpretation
given.
for
example
in
jones
versus
cunningham,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
in
jones,
this
court
was
saying
that
habeas
corpus
can
be
used
for
other
things
then
to
attack
iron
bar
custody;
that
there
are
other
restraints
on
liberty
which
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
can
be
used
to
attack.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
i
think
if
the
question
is
are
rowe
and
thacker
in
custody,
i
think
the
answer
is
“yes”
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
under
at
least
one
interpretation,
they
are
in
custody
under
the
sentence
which
they're
attacking.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes.
mcnally
held
that
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
--
that
they
were
not
in
custody
unless
they
we're
actually
serving
and
it
identified
service
is
the
only
restraint
or
liberty.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
relief,
the
scope
of
the
relief.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
i
think
that
the
remedy
question
is
here.
i
think
the
remedy
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
not
unless,
i
agree.
that
the
statute
says
“in
custody
in
violation
of
the
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”
rowe
and
thacker
are
asserting
that
they
are
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
that
what
they
are
really
is
not
a
series
of
sentences,
some
one
year
or
some
two
years,
some
four
yours,
some
ten
years,
some
15
years,
but
what
they
are
serving
is
a
total
term
that
the
warden
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
now
has
them
in
his
custody
and
that
he
asserts
the
duty
and
the
right
to
continue
to
keep
them
in
custody
as
they've
served
that
total
term.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
in
the
case
of,
your
honor
i
think
it's
accurately
stated
that
in
both
cases
they
were
already
serving.
rowe's
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
not
in
that
order,
not
in
that
order
your
honor.
rowe
--thacker,
to
take
thacker
first;
thacker
is
now
serving
at
the
present
time,
the
sentence
imposed
in
1964.
in
1993
he
will
begin
serving
three
sentences
imposed
in
1953
and
the
suspension
of
which
was
revoked
in
1956.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
its
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor,
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
seen
two
cases
one
cited
in
my
brief,
peyton
versus
williams,
206
virginia
and
the
subsequent
case
in
either,
i
think
late
206
or
early
207
peyton
versus
grace
says
that
mr.
milton,
the
superintendent
of
records
at
virginia
state
penitentiary
can
schedule
sentences
practically
anyway
he
wants.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
he
could've
scheduled
them
differently
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
depends
through
his
--
the
access
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
unless
the
court
and
mr.
harp
may
be
able
to
correct
me
on
this.
but
i
think
that
unless
the
court
specifies
some
order
in
its
original
commitment
that
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
to
run
consecutively.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i
would
not
like
to
leave
this
court
with
the
impression
that
i
think
the
superintendent
of
records
does
just
arbitrarily
decided;
he
could
under
the
virginia
decisions.
i
think
that
might
again
raise
a
substantial
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that
even
in
that
very
simple
case,
some
strange
things
have
happened
in
virginia.
the
fourth
circuit
last
year
decided
the
case
of
peyton
versus
perkins,
where
the
judge
had
said
stated
the
order
in
which
the
where
to
be
served.
but
then
nobody
could
ever
agree
on
exactly
what
his
statement
had
meant
and
there
was
great
difficulties
arose
there.
but
your
honor
i
think
i'd
like
to
just,
in
the
remaining
minutes
to
take
two
more
things
about
the
mcnally
rule.
i
think
it's
clear
that
can
reach
other
restraints
than
the
totally
of
iron
bar
custody.
i
think
this
is
made
clear
by
jones.
i
think
that
it
was
always
been
clear
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
right
to
grant
relief
in
accord
with
law
and
justice
and
not
just
total
discharge.
this
court
is
not
faced
with
a
black
or
white
situation
where
they
used
to
remand
these
people
to
custody
for
the
totally
of
their
sentence
or
discharges
in
custody
even
from
constitutional
custody.
it
can
grant
that
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled
and
even
as
put
it
out
in
one
case
sited
in
our
brief
cited
in
mcnally
itself;
this
court
did
suggest
that
kind
of
relief
could
be
granted.
that
is
the
case
of
united
states
versus
pridgeon
where
it
was
suggested
that
the
man
could
be
remanded
to
serve
his
five
years
but
not
five
years
at
hard
labor
because
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i'm
not
making
that
argument.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
did
not.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
indeed
presented
his
argument
with
great
candor
today.
the
fact
remains
that
robert
rowe
and
clyde
thacker
are
in
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
for
50
and
64
years
respectively.
they
assert
that
substantial
portions
of
this
term
are
unconstitutional
and
they
ask
a
federal
hearing
and
adjudication
on
their
claims.
they
don't
ask
they'd
be
released
totally
from
custody.
they
ask
only
that
the
illegal
portions
of
the
custody
be
stricken
from
their
term.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
essential
illegality
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
alleged
in
both
cases
is
ineffective
as
representation
of
counsel.
i
think
that
is
the
essential
allegation
and
that
is
conceded
by
the
state
and
found
by
the
fourth
circuit
prima
facie
on
their
allegations
to
entitle
them
to
a
hearing
if
a
hearing
is
available.
i
think
it's
some
important
to
point
out
the
substantial
areas
of
agreement
between
the
respondent,
petitioners
and
the
state
and
to
reemphasize
what
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
has
stated
today.
that
is
we
all
agree
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
the
hearing
is
available;
that
they've
alleged
serious
defects
in
the
process
by
which
they
were
tried
and
convicted.
we
also
agree
that
the
claims
can
be
heard
and
adjudicated
most
effectively
now,
today.
not
in
1993
or
1994.
its
--
i
think
that
both
cases
would
require
a
substantial
testimony
by
witnesses.
in
mr.
rowe's
case,
he
alleges
in
that
case
that
his
lawyer
told
him
that
he
should
plead
guilty
to
a
charge
of
abduction
of
a
female
with
intend
to
defile
in
neighboring
city
of
stanton
because
even
though
it
already
been
convicted
in
the
city
of
waynesboro
for
rape
in
the
same
incident
and
sentenced
to
30
years,
than
any
sentence
imposed
upon
him
in
the
neighboring
city
would
have
to
run
concurrent
with
that
sentence.
so
i
think
that
in
order
to
prove—this
was
just
a
clear
mistake
when
the
virginia
law
and
judge
made
quite
clear
by
imposing
the
20-year
sentence
and
ordering
that
they
run
consecutively.
i
think
that
this
clearly
involved
a
necessity
of
calling
witnesses.
i
think
in
the
case
of
clyde
thacker,
the
evidentiary
problems
are
even
greater,
your
honor.
because
their
this
man
was
tried
for
house
breaking
that
were
allegedly
committed
1951,
‘52
and
'53.
he
was
already
in
custody
at
the
time
of
his
trial
on
other
convictions
and
he
alleges
that
when
he
was
removed
from
his
present
place
of
incarceration
and
brought
to
this
county,
that
the
lawyer
there
who
was
appointed
for
when
the
day
of
his
trial
said
“don't
worry,
i
can
get
the
sentences
suspended.”
which
in
fact
the
lawyer
did
and
let's
not
put
to
state
to
a
trouble
and
of
a
great
expense
of
trial
because
you're
going
to
be
in
jail
for
a
long
time
anyway,
and
this
sentences
will
just
run
or
be
suspended.
and
the
judge
in
fact
did
impose
three
to
five
year
sentences
to
run
consecutively
and
suspended
them
on
the
condition
of
good
behavior
for
50
years.
the
sentences
were
revoked
in
1956
upon
his
reconviction
for
another
crime.
and
they're
now
scheduled
for
service.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
suspension
was
revoked
and
so
he
is
now
scheduled
for
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
under
the
state
provision?
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
his
present
term
that's
un-attacked
here
would
run
out
in
1994
i
think,
your
honor.
both
there
one
is
1993
and
the
other
is
1994.
that
is
assuming
that
he
gets
full
credit
for
good
behavior
for
the
rest
of
his
term,
otherwise
it
won't
commence
until
the
year
2009.
so
i
think
that
we
do
agree
substantially
on
this
that
they're
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
that
the
hearing
is
necessary.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
they've
started
a
prim--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor;
that
if
absent
timeliness
problems,
that
if
this
allegations
were
made
in
district
court.
the
district
court
would
have
to
grant
some
hearing
under
rules
of
this
court.
the
third
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
i'd
reach
the
point
in
the
argument
where
i
wish
to
describe
what
responds
conceive
to
be
the
area
of
disagreement
between
the
prisoner
respondents
in
the
state
of
virginia.
that
area
of
disagreement
apparently
is
this
and
this
only,
and
that
is
the
state
takes
a
position
that
mcnally
versus
hill
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
historically
and
is
extended
to
prisoners
by
act
of
congress.
the
respondents,
the
prisoners
take
the
position
the
mcnally
versus
hill
was
an
incorrect
statement
and
of
the
meaning
of
the
writ.
that
the
writ
was
broader
in
this
historically
and
that
congress
did
not
limit
the
writ
in
any
of
its
enactment,
and
that
includes
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966
which
i
will
avert
in
a
few
moments.
i
also
would
like
to
address
myself
in
a
few
moments
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
reason
why
this
case
should
be
vacated
and
remanded
simply
because
the
state
of
virginia
has
agreed
to
provide
a
state
remedy
after
june
that
is
presuming
that
the
governor
signs
the
bill
into
law.
i
think
that
there
are
at
least
three
substantial
reasons
why
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
should
be
interpreted
in
this
context
more
broadly
that
they
we're
interpreted
in
mcnally
versus
hill.
again,
the
state
agrees
with
the
prisoners
as
to
one
these
reasons
at
least;
and
that
is
that
if
they're
going
to
have
to
the
full
unfair
fact
hearing,
granted
them
in
a
federal
court,
granted
them
by
townsend
versus
sane
if
they
have
not
had
a
full
unfair
fact
hearing
in
the
state
court.
it
must
be
now,
not
a
quarter
of
a
century
from
now.
secondly,
and
i
think
this
point
is
clear,
that
these
men
will
be
in
custody
will
be
in
iron
custody
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
for
the
quarter
of
a
century
between
now
and
the
time
under
mcnally
they're
eligible
to
attack
this
allegedly
unconstitutional
convictions.
if
in
1994
they
can
still
prove
their
claim,
which
i
think
is
highly
doubtful,
but
if
they
can
still
prove
their
claim,
our
experience
tells
that's
it
goig
to
take
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
get
through
the
state
courts
and
if
necessary
through
the
federal
court.
so
because
of
a
rule
of
timing,
these
men
who
perhaps
are
incarcerated
constitutionally
until
1994
will
have
to
remain
in
the
penitentiary,
pending
their
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
pending
a
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
grant
them
that
writ;
so
unnecessary
time
will
be
spent
in
prison.
i
think
we
always
regret
time
that
has
to
be
spent
in
prison
under
an
invalid
sentence.
most
often
we
can
not
correct,
that's
just
unnecessary
part
of
our
judicial
system
is
it
operates
now
in
granting
post-conviction
relief.
but
in
this
case,
it
can
be
corrected
if
the
rule
of
timing
in
mcnally
is
not
followed.
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
that
raise
the
point
raised
by
the
virginia
legislation
is
its
effect
on
this
proceeding
here.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
under
the
broad
terms
of
the
virginia
statute,
if
it
is
signed
by
the
governor,
they
will
be
eligible
to
apply
for
a
state
remedy.
i'd
like
to
make
several
points
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
bill
is
not
long
now.
secondly,
it
was
conceitedly
not
law
at
the
time
these
prisoners
entered
the
federal
court.
and
under
section
22-54
as
interpreted
in
fay
versus
noia,
as
as
interpreted
by
i
think
all
of
district
and
circuit
courts
since
the
exhaustion
requirement
means
you
must
exhaust
the
remedies
available
to
you
at
the
time
you
enter
the
federal
court.
these
remedies
were
not
available
to
them.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
i
am
working
on
that
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall
that
it
would
not
be—that
it
will
be
signed
before
this
court
hands
a
down
a
decision.
but
the
point
still
remains
that
the
question
is
exhaustion,
and
that
these
prisoners
exhausted
prior
to
entering
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
you
honor
i
think
the
no
--
answer
is
no
to
both
questions.
in
the
first
place,
the
virginia
remedy
would
not
become
available
until
june
28
no
matter
when
it
is
signed
by
the
governor.
in
the
second
place,
even
assuming
that
this
court's
decision
came
at
precisely
the
same
time,
the
question
presented
here
is
the
existence
of
a
federal
remedy.
now
as
to
at
least
one
of
these
prisoners,
clyde
thacker,
it
was
highly
questionable
that
even
if
the
virginia
statute
is
inactive
and
does
go
into
effect
prior
to
this
court's
decision
whether
he
will
have
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court.
for
this
reason
your
honors,
virginia
has
refused
to
follow
the
rule
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
when
a
man
alleges
and
his
counsel
was
appointed
on
or
before—shortly
before
the
day
of
his
trial,
that
he
has
the
burden—the
fourth
circuit
has
held
the
state
when
he
proves
that
has
burden
approving
that
he
wasn't
prejudiced
by
this
manifest
defect
in
the
state
process.
where
the
state
of
virginia
says
and
consistently
maintained
despite
reason
fourth
circuit
decisions
dealing
with
virginia
prisoners
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
prisoner
so
that
thacker
could
make
a
good
case
and
even
if
you
were
just
entering
the
federal
courts
for
the
first
time
in
june,
that
he
shouldn't
have
to
exhaust
the
state
remedy
because
there
isn't
any
available
remedy
even
under
the
new
timing.
so
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is
exhaustion.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
rowe
your
honor
does
make
the
base
of
the
allegation
that
his
counsel
was
ineffective
also.
he
does
not
allege
he
was
appointed
on
the
same
day.
under
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
coles
versus
peyton
which
was
decided
in
january
of
this
year.
the
state
arguably
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
his
allegations
of
ineffective
representation
of
counsel.
arguably
he
would,
so
arguably
at
least
rowe
wouldn't
have
an
adequate
state
remedy
even
after
the
virginia
statute
goes
into
effect.
and
your
honor,
as
counsel
for
state
of
virginia,
candidly
conceded,
it
will
not
answer
the
question
to
vacate
and
remand
these
cases
because
in
the
fourth
circuit
at
least,
the
court
has
unanimously
en
banc
taken
had
decided
that
there
is
a
federal
remedy
available
and
has
made
that
federal
available
at
least
in
the
states
in
the
fourth
circuit.
other
states
and
other
circuit
are
not
making
such
remedy
available
and
the
federal
court
do
not
make
a
federal
remedy
available
either.
so
i
think
even
this
case
is
of
great
importance
for
the
whole
administration
of
justice
in
this
area.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
there
is
substantial
reason
for
ruling
mcnally
in
this
case
and
in
any
case.
but
as
to
these
men,
they
have
done
what
the
act
of
congress
required
them
to
do.
they've
exhausted
their
state
remedies,
all
the
remedies
that
were
available
to
them;
to
remand
them,
to
the
state
process
now
when
its
arguable
that
there
isn't
even
an
effect
of
remedy
now
for
them,
even
after
the
statute
and
the
state.
i
do
not
think
answers
the
question
presented
by
this
case
and
that
is,
is
there
a
federal
remedy
for
these
men
or
if
the
state
of
virginia
decides
that
these
men
were
not
unconstitutionally
convicted.
do
they
then
have
to
wait
another
25
years
before
they
can
get
there
townsend
versus
sane
hearing
in
the
federal
court?
if
virginia
decides
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
that
these
men
should
be
remanded
to
total
custody
extending
pass
1994
under
the
rule
on
mcnally,
they
will
not
be
able
to
get
their
townsend
versus
sane
hearing
here.
and
i
think
your
honor
i
would
just
like
briefly
to
speak
to
the
effect
of
case
versus
nebraska
on
this
case.
case
arose
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
in
that
case,
the
remedy
asked
for
was
and
adjudications
of
the
failure
to
afford
state
habeas
corpus,
what
required
to
granting
some
kind
of
federal
relief
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
nebraska
granted
the
remedy
the
case,
i
think
clearly
became
moot.
that's
obviously
not
true
here
even
if
virginia
grants
a
state
of
remedy,
it
doesn't
answer
question
of
the
availability
of
the
federal
remedy.
i
think
there
is
a
third
reason,
a
third
substantial
reason
why
we
should
and
why
this
court
should
reconsider
mcnally
and
hold
that
these
men
are
in
custody
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
these
men
are
both
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary.
they
are
in
the
maximum
security
institution.
penologists
generally
talk
about
grades
of
custody
within
penal
institutions.
these
men
are
in
the
maximum
security
prison.
they
may
be
there
because
of
the
sentences
which
they
alleged
are
unconstitutional.
i
agree,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
but
then
there
really
is
no
record.
there
is
never
any
hearing
on
this
issue.
so
that
becomes
determinative
as
to
whether
or
not
these
men
are
actually
suffering
now
because
of
the
impact
to
these
sentences
and
that
is
the
only
way
this
case
can
be
determined
at
the
very
least.
the
men
are
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
present
impact
of
these
sentences.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i'm
asking
that
this
court
overrule
mcnally
because
it
was
not
a
correct
or
a
necessary
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
great
writ
historically
or
as
congress
made
it
available
to
prisoners
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i'm
not
sure
whether
mcnally
purported
to
base
itself
on
the
constitution.
i
think
mcnally
was
based
on
two
premises,
and
that
is
we
look
the
common
law
to
see
what
the
scope
of
the
writ
is,
but
then
we
must
look
to
the
act
of
congress;
we
must
look
to
the
statute
to
see
to
what
extent
congress
extended
the
historical
great
writ
to
prisoners.
so
i'd
say
it
was
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
you
honor.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
that
is
behind
this.
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
we
don't
rely
on
a
constitutional
provision
here.
we
could
rely
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
you
honor
i
think
i've
corrected
my
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
--
the
constitutional
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
we
might
look
to
the
suspension
clause
and
the
interaction
into
the
suspension
clause
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
suspension
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
be
suspended.
i
think
your
honor
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it's
not
necessary
though
to
reach
any
constitutional
question
here
because
i
think
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
another
way
which
obviates
the
necessity
for
reaching
any
constitutional
issue.
and
the
way
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
is
this
i
think
your
honors.
mcnally
was
based
on
three
premises
which
i
think
we
can
briefly
describe
as
this
that
only
iron
bar
custody
was
attackable
by
habeas
corpus,
no
other
restraints
on
liberty.
secondly,
that
the
applicant
must
assert
the
right
to
a
total
release
from
this
iron
bar
custody.
and
thirdly
that
he
must
assert
the
right
to
immediate
release,
immediate
total
discharge
from
iron
bar
custody.
mcnally
purported
to
find
the
necessity
for
such
an
interpretation
in
the
history
of
the
writ
at
common
law
and
in
the
congressional
statute
itself,
and
i
think
that
it's
correct
in
either
case.
even
at
that
time
and
certainly
not
now
when
the
parole,
the
probation
systems
are
so
much
more
developed
than
they
were
before.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
mcnally
--
that
upholding
the
mcnally
interpretation
and
that
is
that
saying
the
congress
said
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
only
available
on
these
circumstances,
raises
to
serious
constitutional
problems
to
which
you
have
averted.
but
i
don't
think
your
honor
again
that
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
point.
because
i
think
it's
quite
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
that
there
are
several
things
that
could
be
said
to
that.
in
the
first
place
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
point.
i
think
if
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
point,
it's
at
least
partially
come
down
against
mcnally.
i
refer
to
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966,
section
22-44.
and
in
that
section
to
22-44
b,
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1966,
the
statute
now
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
courts
might
be
able
to
grant
release
from
custody
or
other
remedy
on
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
i
assume
that
that
was
to
conform
what
supervisions
in
the
preceding
habeas
corpus
sections
that
all
federal
court,
once
the
writ
is
supplied
for,
can
grant
that
relief
which
law
and
justice
requires.
so
your
honor
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
reaching
the
prime
issues
of
what
the
constitution
requires
of
the
great
writ.
what
the
circumstances
and
the
scope
which
the
constitution
requires
at
the
great
writ;
i
think
however
this
court
would
be
based
with
that
issue
squarely
unless
mcnally's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
reevaluated.
and
i
think
this
court
has
already
reevaluated
since
mcnally,
the
interpretation
given.
for
example
in
jones
versus
cunningham,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
in
jones,
this
court
was
saying
that
habeas
corpus
can
be
used
for
other
things
then
to
attack
iron
bar
custody;
that
there
are
other
restraints
on
liberty
which
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
can
be
used
to
attack.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
i
think
if
the
question
is
are
rowe
and
thacker
in
custody,
i
think
the
answer
is
“yes”
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
under
at
least
one
interpretation,
they
are
in
custody
under
the
sentence
which
they're
attacking.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes.
mcnally
held
that
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
--
that
they
were
not
in
custody
unless
they
we're
actually
serving
and
it
identified
service
is
the
only
restraint
or
liberty.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
the
relief,
the
scope
of
the
relief.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
i
think
that
the
remedy
question
is
here.
i
think
the
remedy
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
not
unless,
i
agree.
that
the
statute
says
“in
custody
in
violation
of
the
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”
rowe
and
thacker
are
asserting
that
they
are
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
that
what
they
are
really
is
not
a
series
of
sentences,
some
one
year
or
some
two
years,
some
four
yours,
some
ten
years,
some
15
years,
but
what
they
are
serving
is
a
total
term
that
the
warden
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
now
has
them
in
his
custody
and
that
he
asserts
the
duty
and
the
right
to
continue
to
keep
them
in
custody
as
they've
served
that
total
term.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
in
the
case
of,
your
honor
i
think
it's
accurately
stated
that
in
both
cases
they
were
already
serving.
rowe's
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
not
in
that
order,
not
in
that
order
your
honor.
rowe
--thacker,
to
take
thacker
first;
thacker
is
now
serving
at
the
present
time,
the
sentence
imposed
in
1964.
in
1993
he
will
begin
serving
three
sentences
imposed
in
1953
and
the
suspension
of
which
was
revoked
in
1956.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
its
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor,
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
seen
two
cases
one
cited
in
my
brief,
peyton
versus
williams,
206
virginia
and
the
subsequent
case
in
either,
i
think
late
206
or
early
207
peyton
versus
grace
says
that
mr.
milton,
the
superintendent
of
records
at
virginia
state
penitentiary
can
schedule
sentences
practically
anyway
he
wants.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
he
could've
scheduled
them
differently
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
depends
through
his
--
the
access
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
that
unless
the
court
and
mr.
harp
may
be
able
to
correct
me
on
this.
but
i
think
that
unless
the
court
specifies
some
order
in
its
original
commitment
that
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
to
run
consecutively.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i
would
not
like
to
leave
this
court
with
the
impression
that
i
think
the
superintendent
of
records
does
just
arbitrarily
decided;
he
could
under
the
virginia
decisions.
i
think
that
might
again
raise
a
substantial
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that
even
in
that
very
simple
case,
some
strange
things
have
happened
in
virginia.
the
fourth
circuit
last
year
decided
the
case
of
peyton
versus
perkins,
where
the
judge
had
said
stated
the
order
in
which
the
where
to
be
served.
but
then
nobody
could
ever
agree
on
exactly
what
his
statement
had
meant
and
there
was
great
difficulties
arose
there.
but
your
honor
i
think
i'd
like
to
just,
in
the
remaining
minutes
to
take
two
more
things
about
the
mcnally
rule.
i
think
it's
clear
that
can
reach
other
restraints
than
the
totally
of
iron
bar
custody.
i
think
this
is
made
clear
by
jones.
i
think
that
it
was
always
been
clear
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
right
to
grant
relief
in
accord
with
law
and
justice
and
not
just
total
discharge.
this
court
is
not
faced
with
a
black
or
white
situation
where
they
used
to
remand
these
people
to
custody
for
the
totally
of
their
sentence
or
discharges
in
custody
even
from
constitutional
custody.
it
can
grant
that
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled
and
even
as
put
it
out
in
one
case
sited
in
our
brief
cited
in
mcnally
itself;
this
court
did
suggest
that
kind
of
relief
could
be
granted.
that
is
the
case
of
united
states
versus
pridgeon
where
it
was
suggested
that
the
man
could
be
remanded
to
serve
his
five
years
but
not
five
years
at
hard
labor
because
--
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i'm
not
making
that
argument.
mr.
john
j.
kirby,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
did
not.
thank
you.
