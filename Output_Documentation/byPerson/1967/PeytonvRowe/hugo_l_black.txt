are
you
asking
if
we
overrule
mcnally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
mcnally
to
be
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
that
the
bottom
of
your
contention
that
mcnally
should
be
overruled;
the
constitutional
provision
with
reference
to
the
right
to
a
speedy,
public
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
what
is
the
constitutional
provision
for
me
to
rely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you've
said
that
mcnally
--
you
didn't
know
whether
it
might
be
a
constitutional
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
asking
if
we
overrule
mcnally
if
on
the
basis,
i
suppose
on
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
we
could
find
something
in
the
constitution
which
makes
it
what's
been
done
illegal.and
what
would
make
that
illegal
other
than
provision
to
a
speedy
public
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suspension
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
think
that's
proper
to
argue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
what
your
basic
argument
now
is
that
is.
if
you
reach
the
constitutional
effect
that
this
is
a
judicial
suspension
of
the
writ
to
habeas
corpus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we're
talking
only
is
statutory
construction
why,
since
the
court
decided
that
mcnally
and
congress
has
invested
itself
to
the
same
sections
of
through
this
statute
here,
why
not
leave
it
to
the
congress?
we
don't
often
do
--
overrule
of
statutory
constructions
case.
