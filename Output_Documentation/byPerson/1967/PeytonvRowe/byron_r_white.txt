so
you
said
in

situation
on
the
end
of
the
line
that
you
think
is
and
should
be,
is
a
chance
to
petition
for
cert
here
from
the
state
collateral
relief.
justice

white
from
denial
of
state
collateral
relief?
justice
byron

but
if
we
denied
certiorari
here
there
would
be
no
resort
to
federal
habeas
after
that.
justice
byron

white
and
in
terms
of
questions
of
law,
you
might
say
that's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
that's
some
defect
in
hearing
then
there's
a
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
is
there
will
be
a
procedure
to
a
relief?
justice
byron
r.

now
that's
a
little
different
point
as
to
whether
or
not
you
could
do
something
in
habeas
corpus
besides
discharge.
at
least
that
point's
a
little
different
saying
whether
you
have
to
be
in
custody
in
the
first
place
in

with
the
sentence
which
you

justice
