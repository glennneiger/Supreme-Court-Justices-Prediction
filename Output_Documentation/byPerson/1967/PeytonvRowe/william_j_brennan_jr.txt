justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
which
one
of
the
provisions
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than
that
does
he
might
yet
get
this
break?
the
first
sentence
is
30
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
can't
attack
you
now
he
wants
to
attack
that's
a
30-year
sentence.
so
1993
about
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
example
this,
do
you
suppose
he'll
be
in
a
position
when
the
governor
signs
your
new
law
to
go
into
your
state
court
to
attack
that
second
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
maybe
this
one.
he
will
be
able
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
what's
the
year
if
the
governor
signs
this,
the
next
couple
of
weeks,
this
could
be
the
question
over
the
years
automatic
state
remedy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
harp,
didn't
we
do
exactly
this
in
case
of
nebraska?
you
recall
the
case
came
here
and
the
statute
was
enacted
just
three
or
four
days
before
our
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
report
that
circumstance
since
the
state
now
provided
a
remedy
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
your
opposite
number,
came
here
and
told
us
that
that
state
procedure
is
now
available.
we
simply
vacated
it
and
sent
it
back
for
the
state
--
prisoner
to
proceed
under
the
new
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
i
mr.
kirby,
as
suppose
we
allege
the
illegality
in
a
double
jeopardy
argument
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
suspension?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
on
the
timetable,
what
would
he
be
able
to
attack
if
under
the
state
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state's
submission,
when
does
this
--
his
present
term
when
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
kirby,
when
the
judge
imposes
these
sentences
in
this
instance,
was
he
already
serving
the
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
the
second
conviction
following
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
that
is
against
the
first
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
would
it
be
possible
to
change
the
order
of
the
sequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
may?
so
he
could
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
when
you
have,
well
i
gather
the
more
usual
situation
that
is
the
prosecution
under
the
fact
of
several
counts,
and
there
are
convictions
when
the
--
and
that
the
second
sentence
is
imposed,
who
picks
out
what
sentence
shall
be
served
first
and
what
count,
how
effect
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
judge
says
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
“guilty
on
all
counts.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
year
on
each
count
to
run
consecutively.
that's
all
he
says
and
the
warden
may
say
“well
you're
serving
your
sentence
under
the
third
count,
i
want
you
to
follow
that
with
the
one
with
the
fourth
and
then
go
back
to
the
first”
etcetera?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
difference
if
the
court
says
“we
sentence
you
to
all
counts
that
under
the
first
to
be
followed
by
that
under
the
second
and
then
the
third,
the
fourth”
that
binds
them
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
are
you
making
any
argument
at
all
mr.
kirby
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
proper
deposition
of
the
custody
in
which
you
cite,
in
which
you
cite
application
on
the
facts
of
mcnally,
in
any
event
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
custody
can
be
possible
to
appraise
this
section?
are
you
making
an
argument
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
give
these
cases
accountable
to
be
suspicious?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
kirby.
mr.
harp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
in
light
of
this
warden
if
he
made
a
booking
entry
which
had
a
different
order
of
service
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
mr.
harp,
you
did
say
virginia
had
this
statutory
provision
of
that
shall
serve
in
the
order
of
which
after
the
first?
you
said
“i
think
the
conviction
throws
in
the
record.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
imposed
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
a
follow
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
the
federal
court
if
an
officer
gives
the
sentence
--
gives
the
prisoner
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
which
one
of
the
provisions
that
is

justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes

you.
