this
is
also
being
handled
in
the
virginia
courts
after

28.
justice
thurgood

the
point
is,
suppose
just
by
shear
chance.
this
case
is
not
decided
by
us.
until
after
the
governor
signs
the
bill,
that's
this
month
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
assume
by
chance.
it's
not
decided
before
that.
what
about
the
virginia
remedy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
april
28,
these
prisoners
would
have
under
virginia's
argument,
a
post
conviction
proceeding
in
the
virginia
courts
and
under
your
argument
after
april
28
there
would
have
a
post
conviction
proceeding
in
the
federal
court.
so
as
of
april
28,
realistically
is
merely
which
court
this
hearing
is
going
to
be
held.and
finally,
that
does
not
completely
knockout
the
1994
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
about
rowe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
in
regardless
of
this
particular
case
and
these
particular
men
what
we
should
do
is
look
pass
at
everything,
and
overrule
mcnally
on
general
principle?
