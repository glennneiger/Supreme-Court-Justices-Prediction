mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
these
two
cases
are
relatively
simple
and
are
identical.
in
both
cases,
the
prisoners
are
state
prisoners.
in
both
cases
they
are
not
attacking
the
sentences
which
they
are
now
serving.
in
both
cases
they
are
attacking
sentences
to
be
served
in
the
future.
in
both
cases
the
petitions
presented
prima
facie
cases
upon
which
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
they
we're
serving
the
sentence
of
which
they
complain.
we
contend
however,
that
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
these
cases
is
incorrect
and
wrong.
because
the
fourth
circuit
held
“that
a
prisoner
--
a
state
prisoner
in
a
federal
court
is
entitled
to
attack
a
sentence
to
be
served
in
the
future”
now
less
there
be
no
confusion
about
our
position
in
this
matter.
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
tenure
and
spirit
of
the
decision
but
we
object
to
it
on
a
legal
--
purely
legal
basis.
for
a
little
history
of
the
matter,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact,
as
stated
in
our
briefing
that
two
years
ago,
governor
godwin
asked
the
virginia
advisor
for
legislative
counsel,
which
is
composed
of
members
of
our
general
assembly.
to
study
the
problems
that
tenant
to
the
ever
increasing
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
being
filed
and
to
try
come
up
with
some
suggested
statutory
amendments
to
help
us
--
help
the
courts
in
handling
this
increase
load.
i
served
as
a
member
of
the
subcommittee
and
of
acting
committee
of
the
valc
and
connect
with
the
study.
and
prior
to
the
argument
in
rowe
and
thacker
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
valc
had
already
decided
to
recommend
a
legislation
which
was
subsequently
passed
by
this
session
of
the
general
assembly.
and
although
it
has
not
yet
been
signed
into
law,
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
in
due
course
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
law.
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
you
will
find
at
the
provisions
of
8-596
of
the
code
of
virginia,
is
now
amended
which
will
go
into
effect
on
the
first
moment
of
june
28
of
this
year.
now
provide
specifically
“that
a
prisoner
may
attack
a
sentence
in
the
câmara
of
the
virginia.
a
state
prisoner
may
attack
a
sentence
to
be
served
in
the
future
even
though
he
is
not
attacking
the
validity
of
present
detention.”
so
the
virginia
general
assembly
has
seen
to—had
has
felt
that
the
rowe
and
thacker
rule
is
appropriate.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
rowe
and
thacker
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
has
adjourned
sir.
both
houses
have
adjourned
the
constructive
session
will
be.
i
believe
on
the
29th
at
which
time
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
of
the
senate
will
sign
all
the
bills
that
were
passed
there
at
the
end,
and
then
they
will
all
go
to
governor
godwin
for
his
signature,
so
all
the
enrolled
bills
have
been
prepared.
appendix
is
taking
from
the
enrolled
bill
so
that
it
as
it
was
passed
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
you
will
find
that
in
paragraph
three
b-3.
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
goes
over
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now
we
agree
with
the
spirit
of
it
because
we
think
quite
candidly,
that
it
protects
the
rights
of
the
general
public
as
well
as
that
of
the
prisoners.
for
as
time
passes,
minds
grow
dim.
and
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
for
an
attorney
to
explain
ten
years
after
he
tried
a
case
how
he
tried
it.
we
hope
to
alleviate
this
situation
by
some
other
legislation
which
provides
that
after
28
june,
in
all
criminal
cases
wherein
the
accused
is
sentenced
to
serve
a
period
of
five
years
or
more
in
the
penitentiary.
original
two
copies
of
the
transcript
will
be
forthwith
prepared
and
filed.
i
think
the
court
has
made
a
little
crowd
of
that
after
while
but
we
will
have
available
records.
our
disagreement
with
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
therefore
is
not
with
the
spirit
of
it.
our
disagreement
with
it
is
that
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal
code
particularly
28
usc,
22-54
and
22-41
repeatedly
used
the
words
“in
custody”,
and
as
ms.sollof
just
remarked
a
moment
ago
in
the
previous
case,
congress
has
recently
amended
one
of
those
sections
and
repeated
those
words.
this
court
in
mcnally
and
in
subsequent
cases
as
late
as
fay
against
noia
has
upheld
the
doctrine
that
a
prisoner
must
be
in
custody
to
attack
the
sentence
of
which
he
complains.
now
i'm
familiar
with
the
case
of
jones
against
cunningham
where
this
court
decided
that
a
prisoner
could
attack
a
sentence
even
though
he
was
parole,
i'm
very
familiar
with—i
lost
it
in
this
court.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
reasoning
there
is
incorrect
nor
would
have
be
applicable
here;
where
the
prisoner
is
not
being
detained
pursuant
to
these
convictions.
now
there
mentioned
made
in
the
brief
file
on
behalf
of
the
prisoners
by
our
learned
counsel
that
the
classification
system
puts
him
in
custody
because
all
these
matters
are
considered;
all
these
sentences
are
considered,
whether
that
it
goes
on
an
honor
in
virginia.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
aren't
any
honor
farms
in
virginia.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
suppositions,
and
it
supposed
any
conclusions
set
forth
in
the
brief
filed
herein
with
reference
to
that
angle
of
the
case
and
we
submit
that
there
without
any
merit.
now,
one
other
matter
is
raised
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
we
maintain
several
different
types.
we
maintain
a
maximum
security
in
a
unit
in
richmond.
we
have
women's
farm;
we
have
three
other
state
farms,
a
state
farm
for
misdemeanors
and
31
road
camps
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
would
--
this
would
definitely,
i
would
have
state
quite
candidly
have
a
very
important
effect.
for
instance
we
have
a
man
who
is
convicted
in
a
tight
water
area
who
has
four
life
sentences
for
rape
and
361
years
for
40
some
odd
burglary
charges.
in
fact
i
think
it's
the
heaviest
sentence
in
set
of
sentences
i've
ever
seen
handed
out
anywhere.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
he's
got
some
severe
problems.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir,
in
the
federal
court
sir.
and
that's
terrible,
i
agree
with
you.
i
can
not
disagree
with
that
it's
bad.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that's
the
exact
purpose
of
it
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
no
question
about
that.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
it
to
eliminate
the
inequity
and
our
position
is
however
that
the
inequity
must
be
--
if
there
be
well
then
i
think
there
is,
and
principally
for
the
public.
but
i
think
if
there
is
an
inequity
the
place
for
it
to
be
changed
is
by
congress,
not
by
this
court.
because
this
court
would
have
to
hold
that
all
the
words—those
two
other
words
“in
custody”
throughout
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
don't
mean
what
they
say.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
it
can't
get
out
if
another
case
against
nebraska
sir,
unless
you
sit
passed
the
28th
of
june
because
the
statute
will
not
go
in
effect
until
that
day.
it
will
not
go
in
effect
into
that
day.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
don't
go
on
vacation
until
the
27th
of
july
so
--
but
be
that
as
it
may.
the
problem
however
is
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
but
this
presents
a
problem
which
i
think
it
still
doesn't
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
in
all
candor
and
that
is
this.
let's
assume
that
this
court
sends
a
case
back,
vacates
the
opinion
in
rowe
and
thacker
and
the
fourth
circuit
says
it
has
an
available
state
remedy
in
virginia
and
both
of
these
prisoners
along
with
many
others,
go
into
the
state
courts
on
the
1st
of
july
and
we
give
hearings,
they
appeal
to
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
they
relief
in
that
court.
they
will
say
is
denied
either
with
or
without
a
written
opinion.
then
it
come
over
to
federal
district
court.
and
where
are
we?
we're
right
back
where
we
were.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir
thats
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
this
would
be
fine
for
about
two
years.
but
eventually,
you
see,
the
state
prisoners
are
going
to
get
over
in
the
federal
court
with
cases
attacking
sentences
which
it
would
be
served
in
the
future.
where
they've
exhausted
their
available
state
court
remedies,
it's
complete
state
court
record.
but
we
would
be
in
a
position
then,
i
think
quite
candidly,
they
have
to
say
“this
is
really
fine.”
and
we've
given
you
all
the
relief
in
the
state
courts
but
under
federal
statute
you
have
no
relief,
because
of
those
two
little
words
“in
custody”.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
you
could
do
that.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
you
would
have
no
avenue
to
--
in
the
federal
lower
courts
to
approach
and
raise
his
claim.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
when
i
view
will
notice
mr.
justice
white,
the
statute
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
puts
right
heavy
burden
on
the
trial
court
judge
in
virginia,
he
must
now
make
bindings
of
fact.
he
must
in
effect
write
an
opinion;
he
can
dispose
of
it
on
the
original
criminal
court
record
if
he
wants
to.
we're
having
a
lot
of
these
cases
quite
frankly
in
the
federal
courts
now,
where
the
prisoners
working
under
martin
doctrine
of
the
fourth
circuit;
which
holds
if
a
man
is
denied
his
eligibility
to
parole
by
a
future
sentence
he
can
now
attack
it.
we've
had
lot
of
direct
criminal
appeals
for
instance
now.
they
appeal,
they
get
a
lawyer
at
the
expense
of
the
commonwealth
and
last
june
it
could
cost
the
state
$875,000.00
for
just
court-appointed
counsel,
and
they
get
a
lawyer,
they're
appointed
by
of
state,
they
get
a
free
transcript,
they
get
all
the
records,
they
either
--
they
may
get
writ
of
errands
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
the
matters
argued,
opinion
written,
and
then
they
go
--
as
soon
as
they
get
through
there
and
go
right
to
the
federal
court.
and
the
federal
and
as
i'm
supposing
of
them,
on
the
record,
and
we
feel
that
a
lot
of
the
cases
we
will
be
able
to
dispose
off
on
the
record,
present
search
and
seizure
and
course
confession
or
insanity,
many
of
these
other
matters.
now
in
a
brief
--
able
brief
filed
on
the
other
side
in
this
case;
they
suggest
declaratory
judgment
as
a
relief
in
this
particular
situation.
this
was
suggested
in
the
martin
case
and
discarded
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
purpose
of
declaratory
judgment
act
is
we
understand,
is
to
permit
the
adjudication
of
something
whether
it's
a
controversy,
where
something
has
not
been
adjudicated
before.
it's
different
from
habeas
corpus;
here
there
has
been
an
adjudication.
the
prisoner
has
been
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
serve
time
in
a
penal
institution.
so
we
feel
that
that
act
would
not
apply.
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated,
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
and
we
hope
we've
been
candid
about
our
feeling
in
this
case.
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
judgments
of
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
remaining
minutes
for
rebuttal
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
he
can
get
a
relief
in
the
state
court
as
of
the
28th
day
of
june
sir.
he
can
get
the
relief,
that's
why
enacted
the
statute
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
there'd
be
a
procedure.
that
is
probably
a
tad
of
a
better
approach
to
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
comments,
i
think
first,
able
counsel's
first
argument
was
that
the
petitioner
would
be
denied,
these
petitioners
would
be
denied
federal
habeas
corpus
hearings.
unless
the
words
“in
custody”
are
interpreted
to
mean
“not
in
custody”
and
that
basically
is
his
position.
i
would
most
respectfully
point
out
to
this
honorable
court,
and
i
see
nothing
different
between
a
hearing
held
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
by
a
state
judge
and
that
one
held
by
a
federal
judge.
i
see
no
difference
and
in
the
system
as
we
operated
in
virginia
and
half
for
a
number
of
years
and
there
are
many
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit,
most
of
them
now
per
curiams
where
the
state
court
has
held
a
complete
hearing
and
findings
of
fact
made
and
the
case
comes
over
and
the
district
judge
dismisses
on
a
state
court
record.
every
effort
in
virginia
has
been
made
since
i
have
been
responsible
to
the
handling
of
these
cases
for
about
nine
years
now
to
see
to
it
that
plenary
hearings
are
granted.
and
we
make
them
necessary
motion
every
time
we
get
a
case
where
one
is
required
in
our
opinion,
which
is
almost
all
of
them
except
when
they're
paying
frivolous
or
stating
no
facts.
we
see
no
difference
between
the
state
and
federal
habeas
hearing.
and
moreover,
he
has
a
clear
right
of
appeal
and
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
virginia
and
in
by
way
of
certiorari
to
this
court
in
an
exercise
of
his
federal
rights.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir,
mr.
kirby
and
i
have
full
agreement
that
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
merits.
if
the
court
should
vacate
the
opinion
and
sort
of
quite
candidly
dodge
the
issue,
the
issue's
going
to
be
right
back,
there's
no
way
to
get
around
it.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir
i'll
jump
to
that
right
now.
the
method
of
computing
sentences
in
virginia
is
done
in
the
following
manner.
one,
by
virginia,
sentences
are
served
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
received.
there
are
several
little
exceptions
to
this.
one,
in
thacker's
for
instance
he
was
paroled.
and
while
he
was
on
parole
he
committed
some
other
crimes
of
which
he
was
convicted
and
brought
back
to
the
penitentiary
and
he
came
into
the
penitentiary
now
with
a
new
number
on
these
new
convictions.
his
parole
was
then
revoked.
on
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
on
peyton
against
williams
cited
by
counsel
for
the
respondents
held
that
it
was
appropriate
that
since
the
revocation
occurred
after
the
imposition
of
the
new
sentences,
the
new
sentences
would
be
served
first
and
then
the
old
sentences.
if
the
revocation
had
occurred
prior
to
the
imposition
of
sentencing
on
the
new
sentences
then
that
would've
come
first.
moreover
also,
escape
does
not
change
the
sequence
of
sentences.
the
superintendent
of
virginia
state
penitentiary
is
not
authorized
by
statute
to
play
tic-tac-toe
with
a
man's
record.
it
presents
quite
candidly
many
problems,
particularly
in
the
situation
you
outlined
where
he
may
get
eight
sentences
in
one
court
on
one
day
all
to
run
consecutively.
if
the
court
order
not
a
virginia
law,
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
record
must
certify
to
the
superintendent
of
the
penitentiary
a
copy
of
the
judgment
order
of
conviction
not
just
abbreviated
transcript,
but
a
copy
of
it.
if
the
order
shows
specifically,
the
other
in
which
the
sentences
were
imposed,
which
it
must
show
that
he
was
convicted
a,
b,
c
and
d.
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
eight
orders
in
this
situation,
if
there
were
eight
orders
in
that
situation
and
there
was
no
way
to
tell
specifically
the
--
the
superintendent
and
then
compute
them
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
numbers,
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8
you
see.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
then
he
would
come
back
into
the
penal
system
under
his
old
number
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
would
then
be
serving
the
sentence
of
which
he
complained
as
i
see
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
that's
not
the
test,
no
sir.
the
test
is,
so
far
as
computation
of
time
is
concerned
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
when
the
parole
revocation
occurs.
quite
often
for
instance
a
man
may
be
picked
up
on
a
parole
violation
warrant
and
take
it
into
custody
and
then
they
find
out
after
the
getting
that
somebody
else
has
been
looking
for
him.
and
they
may
revoke
his
parole,
he
may
get
to
the
penitentiary
first
or
he
may
not
get
there
until
after
he
is
been
tried
on
his
new
charges.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
are
imposed
time
wise,
otherwise
if
he's
convicted
on
june
the
1st
the
circuit
court
of
algoma
county
in
june
the
3rd
and
the
corporation
court
in
the
city
of
charlottesville,
which
is
right
across
the
street.
he
serves,
i
mean
the
order
in
which
they
are
imposed,
june
the
1st
and
then
june
3rd.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
you
have
certain
situations
where
a
man
may
have
--
may
be
tried
on
six
charges
together
and
the
court
may
impose
three
sentences
one
day
and
three
sentences
another
day.
well
then
it
would
go
in
that
order.
there's
no
more
juggling
going
on.
the
superintendent
does
not
have
if
--
yeah.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
become
--
it
depends
whether
or
not
they
get
stay.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that
can
complicate
it
but
that
doesn't
have
to
usually
enter
into
the
question
at
all
mr.
justice
white.
now
it
was
alluded
also
to
the
fact
that
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
takes
a
long
time
to
get
a
habeas
corpus
and
get
the
case
decided.
i
feel
that
i
can
speak
with
a
small
amount
of
authority
on
this
subject.
since
i
have
been
responsible
for
handling
these
cases
and
operating
this
division
of
our
office
for
about
eight
or
nine
years
i
think
now.
i
have
tried
an
average
i
guess
of
100
to
150
cases
some
years,
at
both
state
and
federal
courts,
and
you've
get
a
hearing
a
great
deal
faster
in
the
court
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
than
in
a
federal
district
court
just
that
simple.
so
i
don't
see
any
merit
to
this
argument.
now,
with
regard
to
factors
relief
on
counsel
appointed
the
same
day,
you
will
find
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
burley
against
peyton
which
we'd
lost
in
our
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
virginia
and
i
think
quite
rightly
sell
we
suggest
that
quite
candidly,
the
court
that
we
should
lose
it
because
counsel
was
appointed
at
the
same
day.
coles
against
peyton
which
was
referred
to
by
of
counsel
for
petitioner
is
one
not
a
counsel
appointed
at
the
same
day
case
in
too
as
court
will
receive
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
that
case
next
week.
but
i
don't
think
on
a
factual
basis
that
it
is
applicable
to
argument
here
in
today.
with
regard
to
mcnally
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
we
do
not
hold
in
the
virginia
all
there
is
language
in
one
case,
although
we've
never
employed
it.
that
just
because
a
prisoner
is
serving
will
say
sentence
a
and
he's
got
15
other
sentences
after
it
that
he
can
not
attack
sentence
a.
that
writ
does
not
mean
immediate
to
discharge
a
custody
but
release
from
that
particular
sentence.
and
this
court
last
week
or
the
week
before,
i
believe
decided
a
case
exactly
on
that
very,
very
point.
so
there's
no
problem
about
that
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
in
conclusion,
i
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
my
learned
friend
at
bar
here,who
has
worked
very
hard
on
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
here
has
yet
been
unable
to
take
the
words
“in
custody”
and
change
them
to
mean
anything
other
than
“in
custody”.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
but
the
question
is
and
the
statute
says
if
your
honor
please
repeatedly
“in
custody
under
a
judgment”
and
they
are
not
in
custody
under
the
judgment.
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
appropriate
way
for
the
statute
to
be
amended
is
for
congress
to
do
it.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
these
two
cases
are
relatively
simple
and
are
identical.
in
both
cases,
the
prisoners
are
state
prisoners.
in
both
cases
they
are
not
attacking
the
sentences
which
they
are
now
serving.
in
both
cases
they
are
attacking
sentences
to
be
served
in
the
future.
in
both
cases
the
petitions
presented
prima
facie
cases
upon
which
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
they
we're
serving
the
sentence
of
which
they
complain.
we
contend
however,
that
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
these
cases
is
incorrect
and
wrong.
because
the
fourth
circuit
held
“that
a
prisoner
--
a
state
prisoner
in
a
federal
court
is
entitled
to
attack
a
sentence
to
be
served
in
the
future”
now
less
there
be
no
confusion
about
our
position
in
this
matter.
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
tenure
and
spirit
of
the
decision
but
we
object
to
it
on
a
legal
--
purely
legal
basis.
for
a
little
history
of
the
matter,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact,
as
stated
in
our
briefing
that
two
years
ago,
governor
godwin
asked
the
virginia
advisor
for
legislative
counsel,
which
is
composed
of
members
of
our
general
assembly.
to
study
the
problems
that
tenant
to
the
ever
increasing
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
being
filed
and
to
try
come
up
with
some
suggested
statutory
amendments
to
help
us
--
help
the
courts
in
handling
this
increase
load.
i
served
as
a
member
of
the
subcommittee
and
of
acting
committee
of
the
valc
and
connect
with
the
study.
and
prior
to
the
argument
in
rowe
and
thacker
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
valc
had
already
decided
to
recommend
a
legislation
which
was
subsequently
passed
by
this
session
of
the
general
assembly.
and
although
it
has
not
yet
been
signed
into
law,
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
in
due
course
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
law.
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
you
will
find
at
the
provisions
of
8-596
of
the
code
of
virginia,
is
now
amended
which
will
go
into
effect
on
the
first
moment
of
june
28
of
this
year.
now
provide
specifically
“that
a
prisoner
may
attack
a
sentence
in
the
câmara
of
the
virginia.
a
state
prisoner
may
attack
a
sentence
to
be
served
in
the
future
even
though
he
is
not
attacking
the
validity
of
present
detention.”
so
the
virginia
general
assembly
has
seen
to—had
has
felt
that
the
rowe
and
thacker
rule
is
appropriate.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
rowe
and
thacker
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
has
adjourned
sir.
both
houses
have
adjourned
the
constructive
session
will
be.
i
believe
on
the
29th
at
which
time
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
of
the
senate
will
sign
all
the
bills
that
were
passed
there
at
the
end,
and
then
they
will
all
go
to
governor
godwin
for
his
signature,
so
all
the
enrolled
bills
have
been
prepared.
appendix
is
taking
from
the
enrolled
bill
so
that
it
as
it
was
passed
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
you
will
find
that
in
paragraph
three
b-3.
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
goes
over
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now
we
agree
with
the
spirit
of
it
because
we
think
quite
candidly,
that
it
protects
the
rights
of
the
general
public
as
well
as
that
of
the
prisoners.
for
as
time
passes,
minds
grow
dim.
and
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
for
an
attorney
to
explain
ten
years
after
he
tried
a
case
how
he
tried
it.
we
hope
to
alleviate
this
situation
by
some
other
legislation
which
provides
that
after
28
june,
in
all
criminal
cases
wherein
the
accused
is
sentenced
to
serve
a
period
of
five
years
or
more
in
the
penitentiary.
original
two
copies
of
the
transcript
will
be
forthwith
prepared
and
filed.
i
think
the
court
has
made
a
little
crowd
of
that
after
while
but
we
will
have
available
records.
our
disagreement
with
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
therefore
is
not
with
the
spirit
of
it.
our
disagreement
with
it
is
that
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal
code
particularly
28
usc,
22-54
and
22-41
repeatedly
used
the
words
“in
custody”,
and
as
ms.sollof
just
remarked
a
moment
ago
in
the
previous
case,
congress
has
recently
amended
one
of
those
sections
and
repeated
those
words.
this
court
in
mcnally
and
in
subsequent
cases
as
late
as
fay
against
noia
has
upheld
the
doctrine
that
a
prisoner
must
be
in
custody
to
attack
the
sentence
of
which
he
complains.
now
i'm
familiar
with
the
case
of
jones
against
cunningham
where
this
court
decided
that
a
prisoner
could
attack
a
sentence
even
though
he
was
parole,
i'm
very
familiar
with—i
lost
it
in
this
court.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
reasoning
there
is
incorrect
nor
would
have
be
applicable
here;
where
the
prisoner
is
not
being
detained
pursuant
to
these
convictions.
now
there
mentioned
made
in
the
brief
file
on
behalf
of
the
prisoners
by
our
learned
counsel
that
the
classification
system
puts
him
in
custody
because
all
these
matters
are
considered;
all
these
sentences
are
considered,
whether
that
it
goes
on
an
honor
in
virginia.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
aren't
any
honor
farms
in
virginia.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
suppositions,
and
it
supposed
any
conclusions
set
forth
in
the
brief
filed
herein
with
reference
to
that
angle
of
the
case
and
we
submit
that
there
without
any
merit.
now,
one
other
matter
is
raised
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
we
maintain
several
different
types.
we
maintain
a
maximum
security
in
a
unit
in
richmond.
we
have
women's
farm;
we
have
three
other
state
farms,
a
state
farm
for
misdemeanors
and
31
road
camps
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
would
--
this
would
definitely,
i
would
have
state
quite
candidly
have
a
very
important
effect.
for
instance
we
have
a
man
who
is
convicted
in
a
tight
water
area
who
has
four
life
sentences
for
rape
and
361
years
for
40
some
odd
burglary
charges.
in
fact
i
think
it's
the
heaviest
sentence
in
set
of
sentences
i've
ever
seen
handed
out
anywhere.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
he's
got
some
severe
problems.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir,
in
the
federal
court
sir.
and
that's
terrible,
i
agree
with
you.
i
can
not
disagree
with
that
it's
bad.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that's
the
exact
purpose
of
it
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
no
question
about
that.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
it
to
eliminate
the
inequity
and
our
position
is
however
that
the
inequity
must
be
--
if
there
be
well
then
i
think
there
is,
and
principally
for
the
public.
but
i
think
if
there
is
an
inequity
the
place
for
it
to
be
changed
is
by
congress,
not
by
this
court.
because
this
court
would
have
to
hold
that
all
the
words—those
two
other
words
“in
custody”
throughout
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
don't
mean
what
they
say.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
it
can't
get
out
if
another
case
against
nebraska
sir,
unless
you
sit
passed
the
28th
of
june
because
the
statute
will
not
go
in
effect
until
that
day.
it
will
not
go
in
effect
into
that
day.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
don't
go
on
vacation
until
the
27th
of
july
so
--
but
be
that
as
it
may.
the
problem
however
is
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
but
this
presents
a
problem
which
i
think
it
still
doesn't
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
in
all
candor
and
that
is
this.
let's
assume
that
this
court
sends
a
case
back,
vacates
the
opinion
in
rowe
and
thacker
and
the
fourth
circuit
says
it
has
an
available
state
remedy
in
virginia
and
both
of
these
prisoners
along
with
many
others,
go
into
the
state
courts
on
the
1st
of
july
and
we
give
hearings,
they
appeal
to
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
they
relief
in
that
court.
they
will
say
is
denied
either
with
or
without
a
written
opinion.
then
it
come
over
to
federal
district
court.
and
where
are
we?
we're
right
back
where
we
were.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir
thats
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
this
would
be
fine
for
about
two
years.
but
eventually,
you
see,
the
state
prisoners
are
going
to
get
over
in
the
federal
court
with
cases
attacking
sentences
which
it
would
be
served
in
the
future.
where
they've
exhausted
their
available
state
court
remedies,
it's
complete
state
court
record.
but
we
would
be
in
a
position
then,
i
think
quite
candidly,
they
have
to
say
“this
is
really
fine.”
and
we've
given
you
all
the
relief
in
the
state
courts
but
under
federal
statute
you
have
no
relief,
because
of
those
two
little
words
“in
custody”.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
you
could
do
that.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
you
would
have
no
avenue
to
--
in
the
federal
lower
courts
to
approach
and
raise
his
claim.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
when
i
view
will
notice
mr.
justice
white,
the
statute
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
puts
right
heavy
burden
on
the
trial
court
judge
in
virginia,
he
must
now
make
bindings
of
fact.
he
must
in
effect
write
an
opinion;
he
can
dispose
of
it
on
the
original
criminal
court
record
if
he
wants
to.
we're
having
a
lot
of
these
cases
quite
frankly
in
the
federal
courts
now,
where
the
prisoners
working
under
martin
doctrine
of
the
fourth
circuit;
which
holds
if
a
man
is
denied
his
eligibility
to
parole
by
a
future
sentence
he
can
now
attack
it.
we've
had
lot
of
direct
criminal
appeals
for
instance
now.
they
appeal,
they
get
a
lawyer
at
the
expense
of
the
commonwealth
and
last
june
it
could
cost
the
state
$875,000.00
for
just
court-appointed
counsel,
and
they
get
a
lawyer,
they're
appointed
by
of
state,
they
get
a
free
transcript,
they
get
all
the
records,
they
either
--
they
may
get
writ
of
errands
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
the
matters
argued,
opinion
written,
and
then
they
go
--
as
soon
as
they
get
through
there
and
go
right
to
the
federal
court.
and
the
federal
and
as
i'm
supposing
of
them,
on
the
record,
and
we
feel
that
a
lot
of
the
cases
we
will
be
able
to
dispose
off
on
the
record,
present
search
and
seizure
and
course
confession
or
insanity,
many
of
these
other
matters.
now
in
a
brief
--
able
brief
filed
on
the
other
side
in
this
case;
they
suggest
declaratory
judgment
as
a
relief
in
this
particular
situation.
this
was
suggested
in
the
martin
case
and
discarded
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
purpose
of
declaratory
judgment
act
is
we
understand,
is
to
permit
the
adjudication
of
something
whether
it's
a
controversy,
where
something
has
not
been
adjudicated
before.
it's
different
from
habeas
corpus;
here
there
has
been
an
adjudication.
the
prisoner
has
been
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
serve
time
in
a
penal
institution.
so
we
feel
that
that
act
would
not
apply.
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated,
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
and
we
hope
we've
been
candid
about
our
feeling
in
this
case.
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
judgments
of
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
remaining
minutes
for
rebuttal
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
he
can
get
a
relief
in
the
state
court
as
of
the
28th
day
of
june
sir.
he
can
get
the
relief,
that's
why
enacted
the
statute
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
there'd
be
a
procedure.
that
is
probably
a
tad
of
a
better
approach
to
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
comments,
i
think
first,
able
counsel's
first
argument
was
that
the
petitioner
would
be
denied,
these
petitioners
would
be
denied
federal
habeas
corpus
hearings.
unless
the
words
“in
custody”
are
interpreted
to
mean
“not
in
custody”
and
that
basically
is
his
position.
i
would
most
respectfully
point
out
to
this
honorable
court,
and
i
see
nothing
different
between
a
hearing
held
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
by
a
state
judge
and
that
one
held
by
a
federal
judge.
i
see
no
difference
and
in
the
system
as
we
operated
in
virginia
and
half
for
a
number
of
years
and
there
are
many
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit,
most
of
them
now
per
curiams
where
the
state
court
has
held
a
complete
hearing
and
findings
of
fact
made
and
the
case
comes
over
and
the
district
judge
dismisses
on
a
state
court
record.
every
effort
in
virginia
has
been
made
since
i
have
been
responsible
to
the
handling
of
these
cases
for
about
nine
years
now
to
see
to
it
that
plenary
hearings
are
granted.
and
we
make
them
necessary
motion
every
time
we
get
a
case
where
one
is
required
in
our
opinion,
which
is
almost
all
of
them
except
when
they're
paying
frivolous
or
stating
no
facts.
we
see
no
difference
between
the
state
and
federal
habeas
hearing.
and
moreover,
he
has
a
clear
right
of
appeal
and
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
virginia
and
in
by
way
of
certiorari
to
this
court
in
an
exercise
of
his
federal
rights.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir,
mr.
kirby
and
i
have
full
agreement
that
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
merits.
if
the
court
should
vacate
the
opinion
and
sort
of
quite
candidly
dodge
the
issue,
the
issue's
going
to
be
right
back,
there's
no
way
to
get
around
it.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir
i'll
jump
to
that
right
now.
the
method
of
computing
sentences
in
virginia
is
done
in
the
following
manner.
one,
by
virginia,
sentences
are
served
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
received.
there
are
several
little
exceptions
to
this.
one,
in
thacker's
for
instance
he
was
paroled.
and
while
he
was
on
parole
he
committed
some
other
crimes
of
which
he
was
convicted
and
brought
back
to
the
penitentiary
and
he
came
into
the
penitentiary
now
with
a
new
number
on
these
new
convictions.
his
parole
was
then
revoked.
on
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
on
peyton
against
williams
cited
by
counsel
for
the
respondents
held
that
it
was
appropriate
that
since
the
revocation
occurred
after
the
imposition
of
the
new
sentences,
the
new
sentences
would
be
served
first
and
then
the
old
sentences.
if
the
revocation
had
occurred
prior
to
the
imposition
of
sentencing
on
the
new
sentences
then
that
would've
come
first.
moreover
also,
escape
does
not
change
the
sequence
of
sentences.
the
superintendent
of
virginia
state
penitentiary
is
not
authorized
by
statute
to
play
tic-tac-toe
with
a
man's
record.
it
presents
quite
candidly
many
problems,
particularly
in
the
situation
you
outlined
where
he
may
get
eight
sentences
in
one
court
on
one
day
all
to
run
consecutively.
if
the
court
order
not
a
virginia
law,
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
record
must
certify
to
the
superintendent
of
the
penitentiary
a
copy
of
the
judgment
order
of
conviction
not
just
abbreviated
transcript,
but
a
copy
of
it.
if
the
order
shows
specifically,
the
other
in
which
the
sentences
were
imposed,
which
it
must
show
that
he
was
convicted
a,
b,
c
and
d.
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
eight
orders
in
this
situation,
if
there
were
eight
orders
in
that
situation
and
there
was
no
way
to
tell
specifically
the
--
the
superintendent
and
then
compute
them
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
numbers,
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8
you
see.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
then
he
would
come
back
into
the
penal
system
under
his
old
number
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
would
then
be
serving
the
sentence
of
which
he
complained
as
i
see
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
that's
not
the
test,
no
sir.
the
test
is,
so
far
as
computation
of
time
is
concerned
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
when
the
parole
revocation
occurs.
quite
often
for
instance
a
man
may
be
picked
up
on
a
parole
violation
warrant
and
take
it
into
custody
and
then
they
find
out
after
the
getting
that
somebody
else
has
been
looking
for
him.
and
they
may
revoke
his
parole,
he
may
get
to
the
penitentiary
first
or
he
may
not
get
there
until
after
he
is
been
tried
on
his
new
charges.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
are
imposed
time
wise,
otherwise
if
he's
convicted
on
june
the
1st
the
circuit
court
of
algoma
county
in
june
the
3rd
and
the
corporation
court
in
the
city
of
charlottesville,
which
is
right
across
the
street.
he
serves,
i
mean
the
order
in
which
they
are
imposed,
june
the
1st
and
then
june
3rd.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
you
have
certain
situations
where
a
man
may
have
--
may
be
tried
on
six
charges
together
and
the
court
may
impose
three
sentences
one
day
and
three
sentences
another
day.
well
then
it
would
go
in
that
order.
there's
no
more
juggling
going
on.
the
superintendent
does
not
have
if
--
yeah.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
become
--
it
depends
whether
or
not
they
get
stay.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that
can
complicate
it
but
that
doesn't
have
to
usually
enter
into
the
question
at
all
mr.
justice
white.
now
it
was
alluded
also
to
the
fact
that
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
takes
a
long
time
to
get
a
habeas
corpus
and
get
the
case
decided.
i
feel
that
i
can
speak
with
a
small
amount
of
authority
on
this
subject.
since
i
have
been
responsible
for
handling
these
cases
and
operating
this
division
of
our
office
for
about
eight
or
nine
years
i
think
now.
i
have
tried
an
average
i
guess
of
100
to
150
cases
some
years,
at
both
state
and
federal
courts,
and
you've
get
a
hearing
a
great
deal
faster
in
the
court
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
than
in
a
federal
district
court
just
that
simple.
so
i
don't
see
any
merit
to
this
argument.
now,
with
regard
to
factors
relief
on
counsel
appointed
the
same
day,
you
will
find
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
burley
against
peyton
which
we'd
lost
in
our
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
virginia
and
i
think
quite
rightly
sell
we
suggest
that
quite
candidly,
the
court
that
we
should
lose
it
because
counsel
was
appointed
at
the
same
day.
coles
against
peyton
which
was
referred
to
by
of
counsel
for
petitioner
is
one
not
a
counsel
appointed
at
the
same
day
case
in
too
as
court
will
receive
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
that
case
next
week.
but
i
don't
think
on
a
factual
basis
that
it
is
applicable
to
argument
here
in
today.
with
regard
to
mcnally
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
we
do
not
hold
in
the
virginia
all
there
is
language
in
one
case,
although
we've
never
employed
it.
that
just
because
a
prisoner
is
serving
will
say
sentence
a
and
he's
got
15
other
sentences
after
it
that
he
can
not
attack
sentence
a.
that
writ
does
not
mean
immediate
to
discharge
a
custody
but
release
from
that
particular
sentence.
and
this
court
last
week
or
the
week
before,
i
believe
decided
a
case
exactly
on
that
very,
very
point.
so
there's
no
problem
about
that
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
in
conclusion,
i
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
my
learned
friend
at
bar
here,who
has
worked
very
hard
on
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
here
has
yet
been
unable
to
take
the
words
“in
custody”
and
change
them
to
mean
anything
other
than
“in
custody”.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
but
the
question
is
and
the
statute
says
if
your
honor
please
repeatedly
“in
custody
under
a
judgment”
and
they
are
not
in
custody
under
the
judgment.
we
would
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
appropriate
way
for
the
statute
to
be
amended
is
for
congress
to
do
it.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
