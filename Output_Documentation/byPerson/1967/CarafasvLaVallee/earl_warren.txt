chief

no.71,
james
p.carafas,
petitioner,
versus
j.edwin
lavallee,
warden.
mr.
cally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
very
important.
i'd
like
to
hear
it
on
your
case
in
chief
that's
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
clear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
much
this
and
that
--
i
don't
mean
you
have
to
do
it
right
now
but
i
mean
before
you
sit
down
i'd
like
to
hear
that
face
of
your
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
miss
soloff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
it
was
after
he
filed
the
petition
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is,
its.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
if
parker
versus
ellis
is
fav
--
is
followed
here,
that
there's
any
procedure
under
new
york
law
whereby
this
man
can
get
any
relief
from
that
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
not
because
of
a
defect
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
something
that
applies
to
all
prisoners
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
they
can
go
--
they
can
have
some
relief
in
order
to
get
the
civil
liberties
back,
isn't
that
right
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
disabilities
does
this
man
labor
under
now
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
this
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
stands
convicted
of
a
felony
for
impeachment
purposes,
and
that
--
and
as
a
witness,
i
would
suggest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
as
a
witness
who
take
the
stand,
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
they
asked
if
he's
ever
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
convicted
of
felony
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
he
would
have
to
say
yes,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
if
that
is
true
if
he
has
no
relief
of
any
kind
from
this
conviction,
what
would
prevent
any
state
from
releasing
a
man
whenever
he
asked
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
he
gets
to
the
supreme
court
and
thereby
deprive
him,
deprive
all
applicant
--
or
petitioners
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
nor
can
we
assume
that
they
will
not
do
it
because
it
has
been
done
to
our
knowledge
in
cases
in
this
court,
many
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
take
the
case
where
a
man
is
in
jail.
everybody
can't
get
out
on
bail,
you
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
before
he
gets
to
the
supreme
court
releases
him
and
deprives
us
a
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
habeas
corpus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
habeas
corpus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wouldn't
take
either.
well,
you
can
start
either
place
you
want,
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
even
though
there
are
constitutional
violations
in
his
conviction,
you
mean
this
--
he
had
no
right
to
come
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
in
this
case
the
man
had
already
applied
for
certiorari
here
and
jurisdiction
had
attached,
and
then
after
that
the
state
had
released
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that's
still
parker
versus
ellis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
fact
that
he
was
on
bail
now
and
not
in
actual
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
some
states
anyway,
a
man
cannot
apply
for
habeas
corpus
if
he
is
on
bail.
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
situation
where
he's
on
bail
and
when
he's
in
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
decide
it
on
the
merits,
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
