i
gather
miss

he

serving
his
time
when
this
petition
for

was
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
before
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding
that
he
completed
service
of
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
point
was
it?
had
it
got
through
the
district
court
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean,
at
what
point
was
he
released
had
he
--
did
he
finished
servicing
his
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
status
of
this
proceeding
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

19
--
after
parker
and
ellis
have
been
decided
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
miss
soloff,
could
you
tell
me
again
what
section
you
say
that
was
amended
in
1966,
and
how
that
amendment
reads?
i
don't
find
it
in
my
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
it,
the
language?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
mind
reading
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
here,
i
gather,
of
the
--
at
the
time
i
think
you
told
us,
that
he
filed
that
application
with
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
that's
--
then
really,
that
amendment,
doesn't
answer
the
parker
and
ellis
question
for
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
speaks
in
turn
that
(inaudible)
may
apply
to
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they'll
entertain
an
application
for
isn't
that
the
way
it's
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
it's
entertained
an
application
for
it,
not
an
issue
of

is
that
the
way
it
is?

william
j.
brennan,

yes.

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
perhaps

i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
when
you
referred
as
to
that
amendment,
you
were
suggesting
that
congress
has
definitely
answered
--

william
j.
brennan,

the
question,
