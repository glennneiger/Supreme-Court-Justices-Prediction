mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
honorable
justices
of
this
court.
in
this
case
here
we
have
several
violations,
we
believe,
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
they
apply
to
this
individual,
carafas.
the
facts
are
simply
as
follows,
on
june
the
3rd,
of
1959,
a
theft
complaint
was
given
to
the
detectives
of
nassau
county
which
is
in
mineola,
new
york.
someone
had
--
someone
has
stolen
furniture
from
a
development.
it
developed
that
a
cadillac
and
a
trailer
was
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
this
area
sometime
earlier
that
day.
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
situation,
the
detectives
learned
who
the
owner
that
automobile,
a
cadillac
automobile
was
and
it
was
james
carafas.
thereafter,
the
detectives
learned
where
he
resided
--
35-53
36th
avenue,
in
new
york
--
in
queens,
new
york
and
they
went
to
the
premises.
this
is
a
premises
which
contains
two-stories.
the
first
storey
was
occupied
by
a
physician
and
the
second
story
was
occupied
by
mr.
carafas
and
his
family.
upon
arriving
there,
detective
grame
and
capler
(ph)
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
and
entered
the
premises
in
the
vestibule.
thereafter,
they
said
they
went
into
the
doctor's
office
and
they
inquired
where
carafas
lived
and
someone
said,
"upstairs",
and
detective
grame
and
capler
(ph)
then
mounted
the
stairway.
as
they
mounted
the
stairway,
they
said
they
noticed
some
furniture
which
was
on
the
landing
which
was
of
the
type
described
to
them
by
the
owner
of
the
development.
and
upon
reaching
the
top
of
the
stairway,
they
said
they
put
one
james
carafas
under
arrest.
the
version
of
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
in
this
instance
is
quite
different.
his
version
is
that
he
was
lying
on
a
divan
in
his
living
room,
and
that
these
two
detectives
walked
into
his
living
room,
awakened
him
and
then
start
to
run
--
rushed
at
into
his
premises.
so
much
so
that
quite
a
commotion
was
caused
and
other
police
had
to
be
called
from
the
city
of
new
york.
both
husband
and
wife
were
put
under
arrest.
now
the
issues
involved
in
this
particular
case
are
as
follows:
whether
or
not
the
evidence
that
was
procured
at
this
time
should
have
been
suppressed
under
the
mapp
rule,
which
this
court
decided
on
june
the
19th,
1961.
and
whether
or
not
the
violations
of
the
constitution
also
occurred
as
to
the
individual
rights
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
to
be
questioned
without
an
attorney
or
whether
he
had
to
be
given
his
constitutional
guarantees.
now,
we
contend
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
will
sir,
on
my
reply.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i'm
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
see,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
alright.
mr.
james
j.
cally
alright,
sir.
now,
it
is
also
suggested
that
in
a
companion
case
of
which
you
all
note
that
there
are
the
minutes
in
the
appendix,
in
a
particular
page
239
of
the
appendix,
you
will
note
the
testimony
of
detective
grame
(ph).
you'll
also
note
his
testimony
in
the
trial
minutes
which
are
covered
in
the
appendix
149
through
155
and
you'll
also
note
his
testimony
in
the
appendix
concerning
the
hearing
that
was
held
before
district
judge
james
t.
foley
of
the
northern
district
of
the
state
of
new
york.
you'll
find
that
the
version
is
quite
different
on
each
occasion.
there
are
variant
differences.
we
say
that
there
was
a
violation
and
this
is
born
out
by
this
fact
that
on
the
hearing
to
suppress
on
a
companion
case,
and
if
the
--
another
matter
which
covered
the
bath
oceanside
development,
the
court
there
determined
that
that
evidence
should
have
been
suppressed,
but
this
came
after
the
mapp
rule
had
been
invoked.
mr.
james
j.
cally
right,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
no,
sir,
it
was
not
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
dismissed
the
appeal.
mr.
james
j.
cally
no,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
sir,
we
did.
mr.
james
j.
cally
we
had
affidavits,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
right.
mr.
james
j.
cally
in
them
--
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
right,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
it
did
because
it
dismissed
the
appeal.
the
decision
was
made
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
would
say
so,
sir
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
--
because,
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
no,
sir.
no
sir,
i'm
not
alleging
that
we
were
but
i
am
alleging
this
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
no,
i'm
alleging
this
judge.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
don't
think
so,
if
your
honor,
please
because
i
believe
that
they
should
have
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
not
at
the
result,
sir.
i
believe
that
they
should
have
passed
upon
these
particular
questions
because
these
very
same
questions
were
being
appealed
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
--
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
mr.
james
j.
cally
well,
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
say
this
to
you
as
a
basis
for
this
statement.
i
don't
believe
that
they
passed
upon
any
of
these
questions
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
because
what
we
did
was
refiled
a
notice
of
appeal.
after
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed,
then
this
man
proceeded
to
--
proceeded
in
forma
pauperis
and
of
course
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
filed
their
affidavits
and
opposition
and
then
asked
in
a
cross
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
subsequently,
a
reargument
was
made
on
the
behalf
of
the
--
of
carafas
and
of
course
that
was
denied
also.
mr.
james
j.
cally
they
had
all
of
the
papers
from
the
district
court
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
--
a
hearing.
mr.
james
j.
cally
from
the
previous
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
from
the
previous
proceedings,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
think
so,
sir,
because
i
think
it
amounts
the
consideration
of
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
sir,
i
will
deal
with
that
case.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
understand
that.
and
i've
read
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
particular
case,
handed
down
by
mr.
justice
warren
quite
thoroughly.
i
think
as
far
as
the
mootness
is
concerned,
it
really
slams
the
door
upon
an
indigent
individual
who
--
for
no
fault
of
his
own
but
through
--
of
course
a
quagmire
of
legal
morass
in
--
on
his
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
has
been
estopped
from
urging
this
particular
matter.
now,
it
is
true
that
he
was
dismissed
on
march
the
6th,
1967,
but
by
that
time,
we
had
already
filed
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
in
october
19
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
it
is
true.
but
this
court
also
came
to
this
conclusion
in
another
case,
if
your
honor
pleases.
in
the
case
of
potter
against
the
united
states,
which
is
also
under
the
same
title,
title
28,
but
it's
under
section
2255.
under
that
particular
section,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
there
was
an
error
in
the
judgment,
even
though
this
man
had
been
dismissed
and
was
no
longer
in
custody,
that
could
be
corrected
and
they
proceeded
to
correct
it,
to
correct
the
error
in
the
record.
now,
i
think
this
is
analogous
to
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
even
though
ellis
against
parker
says,
“well,
once
you've
been
dismissed,
once
you've
been
discharged
from
custody
of
the
law,
then
you
no
longer
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
the
problems
that
had
transpired.
i
think
you
it
would
be
sure
irony
if
we
--
if
the
defendant
didn't
have
or
the
petitioner
didn't
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
the
transgression
of
these
constitutional
rights
because
economically
and
politically
he's
through.
mr.
james
j.
cally
he
is
working
as
a
hotel
assistant
manager,
sir.
and
of
course,
this
stops
him
from
getting
a
good
job
with
a
large
hotel
which
is
now
been
built
in
brooklyn,
manhattan
hotel
as
a
resident
manager.
and
of
course,
if
this
was
made
known
for
those
authorities,
this
man
certainly
will
not
be
able
to
hold
that
job.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
james
j.
cally
that
is
true,
judge
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
my
answer
to
the
nowakowski
problem
is
this,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
it
has
no
application
at
all
to
the
instant
case.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
think
the
facts
are
entirely
different.
mr.
james
j.
cally
but
they
went
a
step
further,
judge.
what
they
did
here
was
this,
judge,
an
appeal
was
filed
before
this
motion
was
made
so
that
the
only
question
that
they
had
before
them
was
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
allow
this
man
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
they
did
not
have
the
appeal
before
them
at
that
time
but
they
wanted
little
further,
judge.what
they
did
then
is
state
--
has
made
a
sweep
in
rule
and
then
said,
“we'll
deny
your
appeal
too”.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
i've
terminated
my
argument.
there's
nothing
noble
as
(inaudible)
to
hear,
of
the
--
when
i've
said
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
them.
mr.
james
j.
cally
thank
you.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
chief

warren
and
honorable

in
this

here
we
have
several

filed
their
affidavits
and
opposition
and
then
asked
in
a
cross
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
subsequently,
a
reargument
was
made
on
the
behalf
of
the
--
of
carafas
and
of
course
that
was
denied
also.
mr.
james
j.
cally
they
had
all
of
the
papers
from
the
district
court
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
--
a
hearing.
mr.
james
j.
cally
from
the
previous
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
from
the
previous
proceedings,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
think
so,
sir,
because
i
think
it
amounts
the
consideration
of
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
sir,
i
will
deal
with
that
case.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
understand
that.
and
i've
read
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
particular
case,
handed
down
by
mr.
justice
warren
quite
thoroughly.
i
think
as
far
as
the
mootness
is
concerned,
it
really
slams
the
door
upon
an
indigent
individual
who
--
for
no
fault
of
his
own
but
through
--
of
course
a
quagmire
of
legal
morass
in
--
on
his
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
has
been
estopped
from
urging
this
particular
matter.
now,
it
is
true
that
he
was
dismissed
on
march
the
6th,
1967,
but
by
that
time,
we
had
already
filed
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
in
october
19
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
it
is
true.
but
this
court
also
came
to
this
conclusion
in
another
case,
if
your
honor
pleases.
in
the
case
of
potter
against
the
united
states,
which
is
also
under
the
same
title,
title
28,
but
it's
under
section
2255.
under
that
particular
section,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
there
was
an
error
in
the
judgment,
even
though
this
man
had
been
dismissed
and
was
no
longer
in
custody,
that
could
be
corrected
and
they
proceeded
to
correct
it,
to
correct
the
error
in
the
record.
now,
i
think
this
is
analogous
to
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
even
though
ellis
against
parker
says,
“well,
once
you've
been
dismissed,
once
you've
been
discharged
from
custody
of
the
law,
then
you
no
longer
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
the
problems
that
had
transpired.
i
think
you
it
would
be
sure
irony
if
we
--
if
the
defendant
didn't
have
or
the
petitioner
didn't
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
the
transgression
of
these
constitutional
rights
because
economically
and
politically
he's
through.
mr.
james
j.
cally
he
is
working
as
a
hotel
assistant
manager,
sir.
and
of
course,
this
stops
him
from
getting
a
good
job
with
a
large
hotel
which
is
now
been
built
in
brooklyn,
manhattan
hotel
as
a
resident
manager.
and
of
course,
if
this
was
made
known
for
those
authorities,
this
man
certainly
will
not
be
able
to
hold
that
job.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
cally
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
james
j.
cally
that
is
true,
judge
--
mr.
james
j.
cally
my
answer
to
the
nowakowski
problem
is
this,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
it
has
no
application
at
all
to
the
instant
case.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
think
the
facts
are
entirely
different.
mr.
james
j.
cally
but
they
went
a
step
further,
judge.
what
they
did
here
was
this,
judge,
an
appeal
was
filed
before
this
motion
was
made
so
that
the
only
question
that
they
had
before
them
was
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
allow
this
man
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
they
did
not
have
the
appeal
before
them
at
that
time
but
they
wanted
little
further,
judge.what
they
did
then
is
state
--
has
made
a
sweep
in
rule
and
then
said,
“we'll
deny
your
appeal
too”.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
i've
terminated
my
argument.
there's
nothing
noble
as
(inaudible)
to
hear,
of
the
--
when
i've
said
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
them.
mr.
james
j.
cally
thank
you.
