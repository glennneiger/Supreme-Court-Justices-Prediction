justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
--
you're
arguing
now
the
merits,
the
search
and
seizure
claims,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
was
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
--
should
we
reach
that
question
at
all
here
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
looked
at
it.
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
your
appeal
after
you'd
filed
briefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
have
it
--
oral
argument,
it
dismissed
your
petition
in
to
--
hear
it
in
forma
pauperis,
but
you
at
all
--
but
didn't
state
and
you
both
submit
papers
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
had
briefs
but
no
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
affidavits
and
some
legal
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
were
in
effect
briefs,
and
so
this
was
sort
of
a
(inaudible)
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
did
reach
the
merits?
they
didn't
write
an
opinion
but
it
must
have
reached
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
--
in
effect,
it
allow
it
to
--
would
you
accept
that
as
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
search
and
seizure
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
you're
not
making
any
claim
that
there
wasn't
--
that
you
were
cheated
out
by
an
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
nowakowski
case,
is
it
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
alright
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
just
summarily
acted
on
your
briefs
and
affidavits
and
rule
on
the
merits
for
the
search
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
you
disagree
with
them
with
the
result
they
reached?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
did
pass
on
them,
didn't
they?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
when
you
brought
your
--
you
tried
to
get
in
the
second
circuit,
you
filed
some
affidavits
with
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
have
the
papers
before
--
from
both
of
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
had
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
affidavits
and
briefs
and
whatnot
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
merits,
from
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
at
least
you
want
to
argue
the
merits
up
here
for
the
search
and
seizure
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
--
is
this
really
not
--
the
issue
here
isn't
mootness,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
here
is
that
construction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
federal
statute
as
to
where
the
habeas
corpus
lies?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
question
whether
the
--
parker
and
ellis
said
it's
a
custody
problem
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
a
mootness
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
could
well
be
held
that
this
case
isn't
moot
at
all
and
still
habeas
corpus
wouldn't
lie.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
go
to
--
that
would
go
if
it
was
here
on
direct
appeal
when
he
released
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
the
question
would
be
mootness?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
might
--
it
might
not
be
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
ever
a
writ
issued
in
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
still
have
to
--
a
writ
still
have
to
be
issued
if
he
won
this
case
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

the
appeal
