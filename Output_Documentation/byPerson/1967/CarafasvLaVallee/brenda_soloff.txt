ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
threshold
question
here
as
has
been
recognized
is
that
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
decision
of
this
court
in
parker
against
ellis.
like
the
petitioner
here
--
there,
the
petitioner
here
has
completed
his
sentence
and
he
has
been
released
from
custody.
since,
to
secure
habeas
corpus
relief,
the
petitioner
must
be
in
custody.
he
must
be
challenged
in
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
custody
and
the
only
relief
authorized
is
a
form
of
discharged
from
custody.
this
case
is
moot
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
28
u.s.c.
sections
2241
through
2254
speaks
consistently
and
exclusively
of
the
availability
of
habeas
corpus
to
someone
who
is
in
custody.
each
sections
speaks
of
custody,
custody
must
be
alleged,
the
custodian
must
make
the
return,
it's
just
--
pardon
me.
even
the
rules
of
this
court,
especially
rule
49,
recognized
that
continued
retention
is
essential
to
continue
jurisdiction
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
ms.
brenda
soloff
when
petition
was
filed,
it
was
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
completed
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
had
gotten
through
the
circuit
court,
your
honor.
he
completed
his
service
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
on
march
6,
1967,
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
after
the
dis
--
it
was
between
courts.
it
was
after
the
disposition
by
the
second
circuit
and
before
the
petition
was
filed
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
before
the
petition
was
filed
with
some
two
weeks.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
i
think
that's
an
error
of
thought
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
according
to
the
cover
on
his
appendix
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
the
petition
was
filed
on
march
20,
which
was
some
two
weeks
later.
after
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
parker
and
ellis,
jones
against
cunningham
and
fay
against
noia,
congress
amended
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
at
least
three
sections
of
it,
and
it
continued
the
custody
requirement.
and
in
fact,
it
added
a
new
subdivision
(a)
to
section
2254
which
provides,
“that
the
supreme
court
or
justice
thereof,
a
circuit
judge
or
a
district
court
shall
entertain
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”.
so
i
think
that
congress
has
in
effect
--
there
was
never
any
question
about
it,
adopted
the
parker
against
ellis.
ms.
brenda
soloff
these
are
the
1966
amendments,
i
believe,
justice
brennan.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh,
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
at
this
point,
i
could
not
say
that
there
is
any
procedure
by
which
he
could
get
relief
from
the
conviction
itself
although
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
he
could
be
relieved
of
any
civil
disabilities
attaching
to
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
not
because
of
a
defect
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
new
york
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
applies
to
first
offenders.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
they
get
back
their
voting
rights
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
and
the
--
they
may
apply
for
licenses
which
might
otherwise
be
barred
if
they
procured
the
necessary
certificate.
as
far
as
post
conviction
relief,
i
might
say
this
new
york
has
a
coram
nobis
procedure.
it
has
been
applied
on
occasion
to
vacate
judgments
of
conviction.
i
would
not
urge
that
that
relief
would
be
available
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
petitioner
here
went
through
the
state
appellate
process
when
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
including
the
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court
so
that
there
would
be
no
further
basis
for
post-conviction
relief.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
only
ones
that
i
know
of
are
the
ones
that
he
mentions
in
his
reply
brief.
he
talks
about
the
right
to
vote.
he
talks
about
the
right
to
serve
on
a
jury.
and
he
mentioned
certain
unspecified
licenses
which
he
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
obtain.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
the
law
on
that,
your
honor.
but
i
will
assume
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
that's
true.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh!
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
see.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
understand.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
he
would.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
that
the
state
is
going
to
do
this
in
bad
faith,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
in
essence.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
may
i
say
with
respect
to
this
case
that
during
the
entire
period
that
it
was
in
the
state
appellate
process,
including
the
application
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
petitioner
was
on
bail.
his
sentence
was
not
running.
it
began
to
run
on
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
where
a
person
is
in
jail
and
he's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
and
the
state
releases
him?
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
could
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
say
that
on
the
direct
appellate
process
--
if
that
were
on
the
direct
appellate
process.
ms.
brenda
soloff
about
collateral
attack
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
brenda
soloff
state
habeas
corpus?
ms.
brenda
soloff
you're
talking
about
state
habeas
corpus
or
federal
habeas
corpus
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
as
far
as
federal
habeas
corpus
goes,
i
would
say
that
this
particular
petitioner
and
most
appellants,
in
order
to
secure
relief
by
habeas
corpus
at
all
must
have
gone
through
the
state
courts
and
have
had
the
opportunities
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
to
apply
to
this
court
and
that
therefore
it
is
not
--
it's
not
an
unjust
result
that
they
don't
have
further
collateral
attack
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
where
they
have
had
the
benefits
of
full
appellate
review.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
by
way
of
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
traditionally
is
a
method
of
attacking
what
we
call
unconscionable
custody.
once
custody
runs,
so
does
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
congress
hasn't
provided
that
i
know
of
any
plenary
appellate
review
of
state
court
judgments
of
conviction
by
way
of
collateral
attack.
they've
provided
only
this
attack
on
custody
and
this
is
i
think
perfectly
just
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
left
to
the
states
and
that
they
have
that
--
petitioners
have
had
the
opportunity
to
go
through
the
states
and
to
come
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
this
is
parker
against
ellis
and
i
think
that
that's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it
is
because
that's
what
happened
in
parker
against
ellis
as
i
understand
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
only
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
jurisdiction
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
i
used
the
term
mootness
only
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
the
only
reason
i
used
the
term
mootness
is
because
parker
and
ellis
does
and
it
uses
it
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
statute
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
that's
right.
the
statutory
jurisdiction
is
what's
important
here.
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
collateral
disabilities,
i
think,
is
not
properly
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
correct.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
correct.
that's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
our
position.
it
may
very
well
not
be
moot
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
a
habeas
corpus
case.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh!
it's
the
new
subsection
(a)
of
section
2254,
the
exhaustion
statute.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
i
have,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
supreme
court
or
justice
thereof,
a
circuit
judge
or
a
district
court
shall
entertain
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
was
indeed
in
custody
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh,
i
think
its
further
evidence.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
no
writ
ever
issued.
a
hearing
was
held
by
the
district
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
sorry.
ms.
brenda
soloff
only.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
nevertheless,
i
would
think
that
in
view
of
parker
and
ellis
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
falls
not
only
in
parker
and
ellis
but
language
in
fay
against
noia.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i'm
sorry.
no,
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
strong
evidence
of
their
intention
to
accept
the
parker
and
ellis
rule
just
as
i
think
rule
49
of
the
rules
of
this
court
is
strong
evidence
of
recognition
that
this
is
in
fact
the
law
and
we
would
suggest
that
they're
--
that
this
is
a
just
result
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
states
do
have
primary
concern
for
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am.
i
would
just
like
once
more
to
return
to
the
idea
that
--
just
to
emphasize
that
there
has
been
no
bad
faith
by
the
state
in
seeking
to
insulate
petitioner
from
review
by
this
court
because
he
was
on
bail
during
the
whole
period
of
his
appeal
and
all
the
time
that
his
run
has
ran
while
he's
been
seeking
federal
relief.
petitioner's
claim
on
the
merits
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice
warren.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
the
law
is
that
in
new
york
or
not.
i
don't
think
it
is
but
i'm
not
sure.
my
only
point
in
bringing
that
up
is
to
show
that
the
time
didn't
run
while
he
was
going
through
the
state
courts.
petitioner's
claim
on
the
merits
has
always
been
that
he
was
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
i'd
like
briefly
to
say
that
our
first
response
to
this
is
that
this
is
a
pre-mapp
trial
and
we
would
urge
at
this
point
in
this
case
that
mapp
should
not
be
held
to
apply
to
people
who
were
in
the
direct
appellate
process
but
passed
the
trial
stage
at
the
date
of
the
mapp
decision.
i
think
that
this
court
has
not
held
to
the
contrary
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
in
johnson
against
new
jersey
and
stovall
against
denno,
indicate
that
mapp
should
be
brought
into
conformity
with
the
miranda
rule
and
with
the
wade
and
gilbert
rulings.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
but
linkletter
is
also
not
a
bar
to
this,
to
this
reading
of
the
case
because
the
facts
in
linkletter
were
and
i
think
that
the
decision
limited
itself
to
those
facts
quite
specifically
that
the
entire
process,
the
entire
appellate
process
had
in
fact
been
concluded
before
mapp
was
decided
so
that
the
retroactivity
of
mapp
had
only
to
reach
back
to
that
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
that
there's
--
i
don't
have
linkletter
in
front
of
me,
but
i
believe
there's
a
statement
in
linkletter
to
the
effect
that
we're
dealing
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
believe
it's
in
the
context
of
chronology.
i
am
sorry.
i
don't
have
the
opinion
here.
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
bar
by
any
decision
of
this
court
to
this
result
and
at
the
same
reasons
which
led
this
court
to
hold
mapp
not
retroactive.
it
should
lead
it
to
hold
mapp
not
retroactive
to
this
point.
we
can't
seek
to
avoid
the
merits
of
this
case
for
any
particular
reason
because
the
case
is
clearly
frivolous
on
the
merits.
the
facts
are
in
the
brief.
judge
foley
made
quite
complete
findings
after
reviewing
a
--
some
1181
page
trial
record
and
holding
his
own
hearing,
and
i
won't
go
into
them
here.
the
reason
that
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
the
appeal
is
clearly
frivolous
is
the
nowakowski
reason,
that
is,
petitioner
says
in
his
brief
that
the
appeal
was
dismissed
by
the
second
circuit.
he's
(inaudible)
here
today
because
it
was
frivolous
and
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
with
that
position.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
court
of
appeals
filed
a
one
line
order
in
which
it
granted
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
denied
relief
in
forma
pauperis
because
it
included
an
order
denying
--
pardon
me,
because
it
included
the
order
granting
our
cross
motion
to
dismiss
and
because
our
cross
motion
to
dismiss
was
for
want
of
merit.
and
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
submitted
an
affidavit
which
contains
arguments
of
law.
it's
in
the
appendix.
here,
in
opposition
and
in
cross-moving
and
petitioner
filed
an
opposing
affidavit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
also
with
argument
of
law.
the
circuit
court
had
before
the
entire
district
court
record
including
the
trial
transfer
of
the
hearing
minutes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is.
it's
very
much
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
would
be
the
only
explanation
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
that
they
did
pass
on
the
merits,
that
it
was
--
he
described
it
a
bobtail
appeal.
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
nowakowski,
there
was
no
cross
motion
made
so
that
it
couldn't
be
determined
what
basis
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
went
on.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
haven't
looked
at
the
nowakowski
record.
i'm
not
sure.
i
do
know
that
there
were
records
from
the
district
court
--
pardon
me.
there
were
records
from
the
district
court
before
the
court
in
--
before
the
third
circuit
in
nowakowski.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
were
opposing
papers
but
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
let
me
say
this.
certainly,
i
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
truncate
appeals
in
accordance
with
what
they
consider
to
be
the
priorities
in
the
merits
of
appeals.
we
handle
in
our
office
very
few
appeals
as
of
right
to
the
second
circuit.
we
handle
in
the
new
york
attorney
generals'
office,
usually
habeas
corpus
and
cases
involving
constitutional
questions
in
which
there
would
really
--
usually
be
no
basis
for
dismissing
for
want
of
merit.
so
i
can't
say
that
the
second
circuit
--
but
i
know
for
sure
the
procedure
of
the
second
circuit
although
i
have
seen
them
dismiss
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
they
don't
provide
that.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
march
6,
1967.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
was
well
after
he
had
filed
the
application.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
court
--
this
case
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
it
was
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
determined
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
was
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
his
application
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
see,
yes.
so
that
he
was
in
custody,
if
we
assume
that
being
out
on
parole
is
in
custody,
as
of
the
time
of
the
application
was
filed,
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed,
and
then
he
was
out
of
custody
as
of
the
time
that
the
application
was
that
--
the
appeal
was
--
the
writ
was
--
most
of
the
writ
was
filed
here?
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
was
in
custody
through
the
disposition
by
the
second
circuit.
and
we
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
know
of
an
instance
where
paid
appeal
has
been
dismissed
without
oral
argument
but
i
do
know
of
instances
where
paid
appeal
has
been
dismissed
without
briefs
on
a
motion
of
some
sort
in
the
second
circuit.
i've
handled
one
myself,
my
associate
here
has
handled
another.
they
will
dismiss
appeals
from
the
bench
as
being
without
merit,
paid
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
on
a
motion.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
what
we
suggest.
that's
all
what
happened
here
and
the
denial
of
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
was
in
effect
moot
to
the
extent
that
any
further
relief
would
be
forthcoming
in
forma
pauperis.
and
the
only
further
relief
which
would
be
forthcoming
after
the
original
record
was
before
the
court
and
the
notice
of
appeal
had
been
filed,
would
be
to
file
further
briefs
and
hear
oral
argument
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
court
not
to
do
this.
and
if
that's
--
this
was
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
and
for
a
very
good
reason.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
threshold
question
here
as
has
been
recognized
is
that
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
decision
of
this
court
in
parker
against
ellis.
like
the
petitioner
here
--
there,
the
petitioner
here
has
completed
his
sentence
and
he
has
been
released
from
custody.
since,
to
secure
habeas
corpus
relief,
the
petitioner
must
be
in
custody.
he
must
be
challenged
in
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
custody
and
the
only
relief
authorized
is
a
form
of
discharged
from
custody.
this
case
is
moot
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
28
u.s.c.
sections
2241
through
2254
speaks
consistently
and
exclusively
of
the
availability
of
habeas
corpus
to
someone
who
is
in
custody.
each
sections
speaks
of
custody,
custody
must
be
alleged,
the
custodian
must
make
the
return,
it's
just
--
pardon
me.
even
the
rules
of
this
court,
especially
rule
49,
recognized
that
continued
retention
is
essential
to
continue
jurisdiction
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
ms.
brenda
soloff
when
petition
was
filed,
it
was
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
completed
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
had
gotten
through
the
circuit
court,
your
honor.
he
completed
his
service
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
on
march
6,
1967,
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
after
the
dis
--
it
was
between
courts.
it
was
after
the
disposition
by
the
second
circuit
and
before
the
petition
was
filed
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
before
the
petition
was
filed
with
some
two
weeks.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
i
think
that's
an
error
of
thought
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
according
to
the
cover
on
his
appendix
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
the
petition
was
filed
on
march
20,
which
was
some
two
weeks
later.
after
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
parker
and
ellis,
jones
against
cunningham
and
fay
against
noia,
congress
amended
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
at
least
three
sections
of
it,
and
it
continued
the
custody
requirement.
and
in
fact,
it
added
a
new
subdivision
(a)
to
section
2254
which
provides,
“that
the
supreme
court
or
justice
thereof,
a
circuit
judge
or
a
district
court
shall
entertain
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”.
so
i
think
that
congress
has
in
effect
--
there
was
never
any
question
about
it,
adopted
the
parker
against
ellis.
ms.
brenda
soloff
these
are
the
1966
amendments,
i
believe,
justice
brennan.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh,
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
at
this
point,
i
could
not
say
that
there
is
any
procedure
by
which
he
could
get
relief
from
the
conviction
itself
although
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
he
could
be
relieved
of
any
civil
disabilities
attaching
to
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
not
because
of
a
defect
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
new
york
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
applies
to
first
offenders.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
they
get
back
their
voting
rights
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
and
the
--
they
may
apply
for
licenses
which
might
otherwise
be
barred
if
they
procured
the
necessary
certificate.
as
far
as
post
conviction
relief,
i
might
say
this
new
york
has
a
coram
nobis
procedure.
it
has
been
applied
on
occasion
to
vacate
judgments
of
conviction.
i
would
not
urge
that
that
relief
would
be
available
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
petitioner
here
went
through
the
state
appellate
process
when
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
including
the
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court
so
that
there
would
be
no
further
basis
for
post-conviction
relief.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
only
ones
that
i
know
of
are
the
ones
that
he
mentions
in
his
reply
brief.
he
talks
about
the
right
to
vote.
he
talks
about
the
right
to
serve
on
a
jury.
and
he
mentioned
certain
unspecified
licenses
which
he
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
obtain.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
the
law
on
that,
your
honor.
but
i
will
assume
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
that's
true.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh!
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
see.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
understand.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
he
would.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
that
the
state
is
going
to
do
this
in
bad
faith,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
in
essence.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
may
i
say
with
respect
to
this
case
that
during
the
entire
period
that
it
was
in
the
state
appellate
process,
including
the
application
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
petitioner
was
on
bail.
his
sentence
was
not
running.
it
began
to
run
on
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
where
a
person
is
in
jail
and
he's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
and
the
state
releases
him?
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
could
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
say
that
on
the
direct
appellate
process
--
if
that
were
on
the
direct
appellate
process.
ms.
brenda
soloff
about
collateral
attack
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
brenda
soloff
state
habeas
corpus?
ms.
brenda
soloff
you're
talking
about
state
habeas
corpus
or
federal
habeas
corpus
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
as
far
as
federal
habeas
corpus
goes,
i
would
say
that
this
particular
petitioner
and
most
appellants,
in
order
to
secure
relief
by
habeas
corpus
at
all
must
have
gone
through
the
state
courts
and
have
had
the
opportunities
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
to
apply
to
this
court
and
that
therefore
it
is
not
--
it's
not
an
unjust
result
that
they
don't
have
further
collateral
attack
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
where
they
have
had
the
benefits
of
full
appellate
review.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
by
way
of
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
traditionally
is
a
method
of
attacking
what
we
call
unconscionable
custody.
once
custody
runs,
so
does
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
congress
hasn't
provided
that
i
know
of
any
plenary
appellate
review
of
state
court
judgments
of
conviction
by
way
of
collateral
attack.
they've
provided
only
this
attack
on
custody
and
this
is
i
think
perfectly
just
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
left
to
the
states
and
that
they
have
that
--
petitioners
have
had
the
opportunity
to
go
through
the
states
and
to
come
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
this
is
parker
against
ellis
and
i
think
that
that's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it
is
because
that's
what
happened
in
parker
against
ellis
as
i
understand
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
only
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
jurisdiction
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
i
used
the
term
mootness
only
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
the
only
reason
i
used
the
term
mootness
is
because
parker
and
ellis
does
and
it
uses
it
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
statute
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
that's
right.
the
statutory
jurisdiction
is
what's
important
here.
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
collateral
disabilities,
i
think,
is
not
properly
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
correct.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
correct.
that's
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
our
position.
it
may
very
well
not
be
moot
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
a
habeas
corpus
case.
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh!
it's
the
new
subsection
(a)
of
section
2254,
the
exhaustion
statute.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
i
have,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
supreme
court
or
justice
thereof,
a
circuit
judge
or
a
district
court
shall
entertain
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states”.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
was
indeed
in
custody
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
oh,
i
think
its
further
evidence.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
no
writ
ever
issued.
a
hearing
was
held
by
the
district
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
sorry.
ms.
brenda
soloff
only.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
nevertheless,
i
would
think
that
in
view
of
parker
and
ellis
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
falls
not
only
in
parker
and
ellis
but
language
in
fay
against
noia.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i'm
sorry.
no,
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
strong
evidence
of
their
intention
to
accept
the
parker
and
ellis
rule
just
as
i
think
rule
49
of
the
rules
of
this
court
is
strong
evidence
of
recognition
that
this
is
in
fact
the
law
and
we
would
suggest
that
they're
--
that
this
is
a
just
result
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
states
do
have
primary
concern
for
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am.
i
would
just
like
once
more
to
return
to
the
idea
that
--
just
to
emphasize
that
there
has
been
no
bad
faith
by
the
state
in
seeking
to
insulate
petitioner
from
review
by
this
court
because
he
was
on
bail
during
the
whole
period
of
his
appeal
and
all
the
time
that
his
run
has
ran
while
he's
been
seeking
federal
relief.
petitioner's
claim
on
the
merits
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice
warren.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
the
law
is
that
in
new
york
or
not.
i
don't
think
it
is
but
i'm
not
sure.
my
only
point
in
bringing
that
up
is
to
show
that
the
time
didn't
run
while
he
was
going
through
the
state
courts.
petitioner's
claim
on
the
merits
has
always
been
that
he
was
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
i'd
like
briefly
to
say
that
our
first
response
to
this
is
that
this
is
a
pre-mapp
trial
and
we
would
urge
at
this
point
in
this
case
that
mapp
should
not
be
held
to
apply
to
people
who
were
in
the
direct
appellate
process
but
passed
the
trial
stage
at
the
date
of
the
mapp
decision.
i
think
that
this
court
has
not
held
to
the
contrary
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
in
johnson
against
new
jersey
and
stovall
against
denno,
indicate
that
mapp
should
be
brought
into
conformity
with
the
miranda
rule
and
with
the
wade
and
gilbert
rulings.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
but
linkletter
is
also
not
a
bar
to
this,
to
this
reading
of
the
case
because
the
facts
in
linkletter
were
and
i
think
that
the
decision
limited
itself
to
those
facts
quite
specifically
that
the
entire
process,
the
entire
appellate
process
had
in
fact
been
concluded
before
mapp
was
decided
so
that
the
retroactivity
of
mapp
had
only
to
reach
back
to
that
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
that
there's
--
i
don't
have
linkletter
in
front
of
me,
but
i
believe
there's
a
statement
in
linkletter
to
the
effect
that
we're
dealing
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
believe
it's
in
the
context
of
chronology.
i
am
sorry.
i
don't
have
the
opinion
here.
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
bar
by
any
decision
of
this
court
to
this
result
and
at
the
same
reasons
which
led
this
court
to
hold
mapp
not
retroactive.
it
should
lead
it
to
hold
mapp
not
retroactive
to
this
point.
we
can't
seek
to
avoid
the
merits
of
this
case
for
any
particular
reason
because
the
case
is
clearly
frivolous
on
the
merits.
the
facts
are
in
the
brief.
judge
foley
made
quite
complete
findings
after
reviewing
a
--
some
1181
page
trial
record
and
holding
his
own
hearing,
and
i
won't
go
into
them
here.
the
reason
that
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
the
appeal
is
clearly
frivolous
is
the
nowakowski
reason,
that
is,
petitioner
says
in
his
brief
that
the
appeal
was
dismissed
by
the
second
circuit.
he's
(inaudible)
here
today
because
it
was
frivolous
and
we
have
absolutely
no
quarrel
with
that
position.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
court
of
appeals
filed
a
one
line
order
in
which
it
granted
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
denied
relief
in
forma
pauperis
because
it
included
an
order
denying
--
pardon
me,
because
it
included
the
order
granting
our
cross
motion
to
dismiss
and
because
our
cross
motion
to
dismiss
was
for
want
of
merit.
and
because
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
submitted
an
affidavit
which
contains
arguments
of
law.
it's
in
the
appendix.
here,
in
opposition
and
in
cross-moving
and
petitioner
filed
an
opposing
affidavit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
also
with
argument
of
law.
the
circuit
court
had
before
the
entire
district
court
record
including
the
trial
transfer
of
the
hearing
minutes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is.
it's
very
much
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
would
be
the
only
explanation
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
that
they
did
pass
on
the
merits,
that
it
was
--
he
described
it
a
bobtail
appeal.
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
nowakowski,
there
was
no
cross
motion
made
so
that
it
couldn't
be
determined
what
basis
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
went
on.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
haven't
looked
at
the
nowakowski
record.
i'm
not
sure.
i
do
know
that
there
were
records
from
the
district
court
--
pardon
me.
there
were
records
from
the
district
court
before
the
court
in
--
before
the
third
circuit
in
nowakowski.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
were
opposing
papers
but
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
let
me
say
this.
certainly,
i
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
truncate
appeals
in
accordance
with
what
they
consider
to
be
the
priorities
in
the
merits
of
appeals.
we
handle
in
our
office
very
few
appeals
as
of
right
to
the
second
circuit.
we
handle
in
the
new
york
attorney
generals'
office,
usually
habeas
corpus
and
cases
involving
constitutional
questions
in
which
there
would
really
--
usually
be
no
basis
for
dismissing
for
want
of
merit.
so
i
can't
say
that
the
second
circuit
--
but
i
know
for
sure
the
procedure
of
the
second
circuit
although
i
have
seen
them
dismiss
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
they
don't
provide
that.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
march
6,
1967.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
was
well
after
he
had
filed
the
application.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
court
--
this
case
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
it
was
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
determined
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
was
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
his
application
to
this
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
see,
yes.
so
that
he
was
in
custody,
if
we
assume
that
being
out
on
parole
is
in
custody,
as
of
the
time
of
the
application
was
filed,
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed,
and
then
he
was
out
of
custody
as
of
the
time
that
the
application
was
that
--
the
appeal
was
--
the
writ
was
--
most
of
the
writ
was
filed
here?
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
was
in
custody
through
the
disposition
by
the
second
circuit.
and
we
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
know
of
an
instance
where
paid
appeal
has
been
dismissed
without
oral
argument
but
i
do
know
of
instances
where
paid
appeal
has
been
dismissed
without
briefs
on
a
motion
of
some
sort
in
the
second
circuit.
i've
handled
one
myself,
my
associate
here
has
handled
another.
they
will
dismiss
appeals
from
the
bench
as
being
without
merit,
paid
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
on
a
motion.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
what
we
suggest.
that's
all
what
happened
here
and
the
denial
of
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
was
in
effect
moot
to
the
extent
that
any
further
relief
would
be
forthcoming
in
forma
pauperis.
and
the
only
further
relief
which
would
be
forthcoming
after
the
original
record
was
before
the
court
and
the
notice
of
appeal
had
been
filed,
would
be
to
file
further
briefs
and
hear
oral
argument
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
court
not
to
do
this.
and
if
that's
--
this
was
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
and
for
a
very
good
reason.
