stewart
oh!
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
but
the
specific
decision,
you're
concerned
with
is
the
linkletter
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
linkletter
was
pretty
clear
in
what
it
said,
didn't
he
--
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
miss
soloff
what
nowakowski
held,
as
i
remember
it,
i
understand
it
is
that
once
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
has
been
granted
by
the
district
court,
then
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
of
appeals
to
treat
that
appeal
as
an
ordinary
appeal
as
of
right,
to
treat
it
in
accordance
with
its
usual
procedures,
the
way
it
treats
appeals
as
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
suppose
then
the
question
becomes
whether
this
is
a
--
consistent
with
the
regular
procedures
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
an
appeal
as
of
right
in
the
manner
that
this
was
--
this
case
was
dismissed
without
argument
but
simply
on
the
records.
i
know,
in
my
experience
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
one
where
i
sat,
sometimes
did
do
that
if
it
was
--
upon
motion
to
dismiss,
the
court
sometimes
did
so
with
appeals
as
of
right
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
a
failure
to
prosecute
or
some
other
grounds.
but
some
court
of
appeals
don't
do
that
and
i
suppose
the
inquiry
therefore
should
be
whether
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
and
regular
procedures
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
appeals
as
of
right.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
don't
know
the
answer,
i
know,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
