justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cally,
i
wish
you'd
tell
me
how
you
get
around
nowakowski.
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
granted
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
did
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
--
dismissed
the
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
and
dismissed
the
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
now
how
do
you
justify
that
in
view
of
nowakowski
and
if
it
--
the
court
of
appeals
acted
wrongly
there,
isn't
that
the
only
issue
before
us
assuming
we
can
get
over
--
go
along
with
you
on
the
mootness
point
in
a
way?
assuming
we
go
along
with
your
mootness,
don't
we
then
have
to
face
up
to
nowakowski
justice
abe
fortas
and
what's
your
answer
to
the
nowakowski
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
fine.
now,
why?
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
nowakowski,
we
held
that
--
when
the
district
judge
grants
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
the
court
of
appeals
must
grant
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
assuming
there
is
showing
of
poverty
and
must
proceed
to
a
disposition
of
the
appeal
in
accordance
with
its
ordinary
procedure.
now
the
court
of
appeals
here,
as
i
understand
it,
denied
despite
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
had
issued
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
the
court
of
appeals
here
denied
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
offer
it
and
as
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
expressly
reject
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
they
rejected
that
expressly,
which
would
technically
would
indicate
that
they
--
that
that
end
of
the
proceedings
and
--
but
then
they
went
on
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
but
may
i
ask
you
another
question
here,
if
you
know
the
answer
to
this.
as
of
what
date
did
the
petitioner
here
become
unconditionally
released?
justice
abe
fortas
march
6.
now,
was
that
after
or
before
he
filed
--
that
was
after
he
had
filed
the
application
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
--
it
was
--
at
what
stage
in
the
appellate
process
was
that?
it
was
before
he
had
filed
his
appeal
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
and
there
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
between
that
stage
and
--

abe
