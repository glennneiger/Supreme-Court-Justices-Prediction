mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bring
has
made
a
rather
eloquent
argument
that
the
arrest
here
was
invalid
because
of
the
failure
of
the
agents
involved
to
announce
their
purpose
before
entering
the
petitioner's
apartment.
however,
at
the
outset
i
feel
called
upon
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
that
very
eloquent
argument
was
not
made
in
the
trial
court.
to
that
reason,
that
issue
should
not
be
considered
by
this
court.
now,
in
making
this
argument
in
this
case,
we're
not
just
merely
seeking
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
decided
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
not,
i
think
under
the
analogy
to
the
(inaudible)
decision
that
the
problem
is
that
this
argument
depends
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
and
petitioner's
failure
to
make
this
contention
in
the
district
court
deprive
the
government
of
the
opportunity
to
make
the
record
on
which
this
court
could
adequately
judge,
one;
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
an
announcement
of
purpose.
i
think
your
honor's
opinion
in
warden
v.
hayden
recognizes
the
fact
that
quite
often
the
fact
that
an
agent
doesn't
testify
or
policeman
doesn't
testify
to
a
particular
fact,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
that
fact
did
not
occur.
i
think
anyone
who's
tried
a
lawsuit
realizes
hard
enough
to
get
witnesses
to
testify
the
facts
of
the
material
to
be
issued
before
the
court
and
it
often
happens
that
facts
and
not
the
material
are
not
covered
in
testimonies,
that?s
a
possibility
here.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
do
refer
to
it
in
the
brief
and
we
cite
the
(inaudible)
case
which
stands
exactly
this
principle.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
done
in
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
important
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
it's
important
particularly
in
light
of
the
whole
question
that
is
raised
in
the
last
part
of
mr.
bring's
argument
concerning
the
possible
exigent
circumstances
that
might
have
justified
why
the
agents
--
if
we
assume
from
it
they
didn't
announce.
why
didn't
they?
well,
of
course
mr.
bring
said
the
record
doesn't
contain
anything.
well,
i'll
come
to
--
wanted
to
minor
items
in
the
record
they
do
have
some
bearing
on
it.
but
generally,
the
reason,
the
record
doesn't
contain
anything
on
this
issue
is
that
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress
made
prior
to
trial.
the
first
time
any
mention
of
a
move
to
suppress
this
evidence
came
was
at
the
exact
close
of
the
government's
case
after
the
arresting
agent
had
testified
and
then
cross-examined.
it
was
at
that
point,
that
counsel
got
up
and
his
objection
appears
at
the
page
28
or
29
in
the
record.
and
it
is
just
clear
from
reading
that
objection
that
in
making
the
objection
he
in
no
way
prior
to
the
prosecution
or
the
court
--
that
he
was
objecting
to
the
manner
of
entry.
to
clear
from
reading
his
objection,
the
only
thing
he
was
focusing
on
was
the
presence
or
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
page
28
to
29
of
the
appendix.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
now,
i
think
that
we
have
here
what
was
present
in
(inaudible)
where
the
government
attempted
the
argument
in
this
case
that
even
though
the
arrest
warrant
was
invalid,
the
court
should
consider
it
whether
or
not
the
arrest
was
proper
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
which
the
aids
may
have
had.
in
that
case,
this
court
speaking
to
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
to
permit
the
government
to
inject
its
new
theory
into
the
case
at
this
stage
would
unfairly
deprive
the
petitioner
of
adequate
opportunity
to
respond.
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here,
the
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
make
the
objection
of
the
district
court
where
the
record
is
made,
deprived
the
government
of
the
opportunity
to
show
exactly
what
happened
at
the
time
of
that
arrest
and
the
exact
reasons
why
the
agents
acted
as
they
did.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
could
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
he
said
the
appellant
raised
the
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
the
client
mr.
justice
white
that
i
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
came
out
of
the
court
that
the
record
was
not
adequate
to
reach
the
full
merits.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i'm
not
sure
of.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
should
determine
the
issue
when
you
have
problem
here,
as
i
said
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
it
is
somewhat
difficult
but
i
do
think
when
you
have
a
situation
such
as
this
where
so
much
depends
upon
the
record.
i
would
assume
i
would
agree
with
you
totally
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
announcement.
i
think
if
we
accept
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
stated
the
record
on
that
then
yes,
but
i
think
the
whole
problem
of
the
exigent
circumstances
is
one
that
so
clearly
depends
upon
the
record.
and
so
clearly
not
developed
here,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
and
he
said
i
knocked
and
went
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
turn
into
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
petitioner
has
--
the
petitioner
contends
that
because
the
agents
did
not
announce
their
purpose
when
they
entered
the
apartment
the
arrest
was
invalid.
we
submit
two
contentions
in
response
to
that.
first,
we
contend
that
nothing
in
either
the
constitution,
the
case
is
decided
by
this
court
where
the
relevant
statute
requires
an
agent
who's
affecting
an
arrest
to
announce
his
purpose
before
opening
an
unlocked
door.
second,
we
contend
that
even
in
this
record,
there
are
sufficient
facts
to
show
that
the
agents
would
be
justified
in
not
announcing
their
purpose
before
entering
the
apartment
in
this
case.
first
i
think
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
statute
if
i
may.
i
think
both
parties
before
the
court
have
conceded
that
in
general,
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
statute
governed
the
decision
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
think
this
was
recognized
in
miller.
i
think
it
might
occur
where
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
constitution,
the
requirement
of
announcement
has
constitutional
overtones.
however,
i
don't
think
having
said
that,
that
we
can
necessarily
accept
the
fact
that
this
statute
totally
controls
the
question
of
arrest.
obviously,
the
statue
was
not
drafted
with
the
problems
of
arrest
in
mind
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas
question
about
the
statue
and
it
does
not
say
anything
about
an
exception
for
agents
who
might
be
endangered.
their
own
lives
might
be
in
danger
in
affecting
the
arrest.
it
does
refer
to
people
who
might
be
inside
when
the
search
is
being
conducted
and
might
be
in
danger.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
that
the
congress
was
not
concerned,
was
not
addressing
itself
to
a
search
situation.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
the
statute
completely
controls
the
situation
here.
i
do
think
that
in
so
far
as
it
talks
about
the
need
to
announce
the
purpose
before
breaking
in,
it
embodies
a
concept
which
certainly
in
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned
this
court
decision
in
miller
makes
clear
is
a
governing
standard
and
as
i
say
has
constitutional
overtones.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
in
what
is
involved
here.
one,
i
think
the
question
is
mr.
bring
has
argued
in
his
brief
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
privacy
not
property.
certainly,
that's
conceded
by
the
government
in
all
situation,
we
are
talking
about
the
right
of
the
government
to
enter.
the
fourth
amendment
said
some
of
the
requirements
when
they
can
enter
and
when
they
can
breach
a
person's
privacy.
when
a
private
premises
can
be
invaded
by
the
government.
so
in
so
far
as
it
requires
a
warrant
or
arrest
pursuant
to
probable
cause
to
justify
the
intrusion,
that's
clearly
concerned
more
with
privacy
than
property.
i
think
the
historical
development
of
the
announcement
rule
as
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
indicates
that
that
part
of
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
is
more
closely
related
to
the
question
of
property
than
privacy.
but
certainly
it
does
have
some
function
with
regard
to
privacy.
in
that,
it
gives
notice
to
the
person
with
and
that
the
agents
are
seeking
--
someone
is
seeking
to
enter.
but
it's
a
fairly
limited
protection
of
privacy
since
the
agents
have
the
right
to
enter
immediately.
so
i
think
there's
no
question
that
you
will
here
face
with
the
problem
of
drawing
a
line.
i
would
concede
that
if
the
agents
open
a
locked
door
with
a
passkey
that
is
breaking.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly.
i
think
that
when
the
person
locks
the
door
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that
it's
common
experience.
i
think
that
the
rule
that
says
that
when
you
open
an
unlocked
door,
that's
not
a
breaking.
it
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
invasion
of
privacy
beyond
that
which
is
expected
in
the
normal
social
and
business
setting.
i
think
that
most
people
i
think
it's
common
experience
if
you
go
to
someone's
apartment
or
home
looking
for
them,
expecting
them
to
be
there,
you
knock
on
the
door,
you
receive
no
response,
it's
not
un
-ordinary
for
people
in
that
situation
to
open
and
try
the
door.
and
if
it's
open
to
walk
in
and
perhaps
went
inside
to
call
out
but
the
person
has
the
right
to
protect
his
privacy
if
he
wants
by
locking
that
door.
and
once
he
has
done
that,
he's
indicated
to
the
world
that
he
wants
his
privacy
protected,
and
he
doesn't
want
people
coming
in,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction
that
exists
here.
i
think
also
you
have
to
distinguish
the
case
here
on
the
basis
of
that
--
the
statute,
the
rule
is
designed
to
provide
guidance
to
law
enforcement
officers
in
making
an
arrest,
executing
a
warrant.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
say
deprived.
i
think
that
that
home
is
a
home
that
has
taken
the
risk
because
it
wants
to
allow
its
children
to
go
freely,
their
children
and
other
children,
and
other
people
coming
to
the
door
may
open
the
door.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
not
lawlessness.
i
know,
i
don't
think,
i
think
that
it
takes
the
risk
that
people
in
society
who
come
to
the
door,
find
no
one,
knock,
will
open
the
door.
that's
what
was
done
here.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
may
not
be
an
invitation
to
anyone
to
come
in
but
it
has
to
reasonably
expected
that
that
may
happen.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
--
there
is
some
question
about
the?
i
think
this
court's
opinion
in
katz
certainly
makes
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
with
what
a
person's
reasonable
expectations
will
be,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
a
person's
expectation
that
nobody
is
going
to
come
into
his
apartment
is
much
greater
when
he
locks
the
door
than
when
he
leaves
the
door
open
or
he
leaves
it
ajar.
of
course,
with
dealing
and
you
know,
it's
a
fine
line
that
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
i'll
turn
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
statute
contemplates
more
than
just
opening
an
unlocked
door?
i
think
that
the
common
law
and
history
of
the
statute,
the
constitutional
requirement,
indicated
that
the
sheriff
at
common
law
was
justified
that
he
only
had
to
announce
his
purpose
if
he
was
physically
breaking
into
the
premises.
i
think
that
you'll
have
to
read
the
statute
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
miller
doesn't
deal
with
--
i'm
sorry,
i
though
you
said
if
you
said
did
our
case
didn't
support
that.
i
thought
--
no
case
before
this
court
has
ever
considered
the
issue.
i
think
there
are
cases,
we've
cited
them
in
our
brief.
symayne's
case
which
we
cite
for
example,
indicates
clearly
that
the
common
law,
the
sheriff
did
have
the
right
to
go
into
an
unlocked
door
and
that
it
only
had
to
announce
if
the
door
was
locked,
before
he
broke
in.
i
think
the
statute
itself
in
its
own
terms
when
it
talks
about
breaking
not
only
the
door,
but
any
door
inside,
or
anything
contained
therein,
clearly
indicates
that
congress
was
contemplating
some
forcible
type
of
entry
because
i
don't
think
that
normally
the
agent
would
expect
once
he
was
inside
of
premises
and
wanted
to
open
the
door,
before
using
the
force
to
pull
that
door
open,
he
had
to
announce
his
purpose.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
that
out.
i
think
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
kept
in
mind,
with
regard
to
this
requirement,
to
direction
to
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
we
have
to
read
the
statute
then,
as
it
would
reasonably
be
understood
by
the
officer
who
is
executing
the
warrant
of
making
the
arrest.
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
agent
who
opened
the
unlocked
door
in
this
case
thought
that
he
was
breaking
into
the
apartment.
that
fact
is
somewhat
corroborated
by
testimony
at
the
trial.
on
page
25
of
the
appendix,
the
agent
who
was
the
chief
agent
in
charge
of
the
investigation
who
made
the
arrest
was
being
questioned,
and
on
cross-examination
by
petitioner's
trial
counsel
--
and
counsel
said,?
by
the
way,
how
is
mr.
sabbath
dressed
when
you
broke
into
the
apartment??
the
agent
answered
by
saying.
when
we
entered
the
apartment,
mr.
sabbath--?
and
said
how
he
was
dressed.
i
think
the
agent
resisted
the
suggestion
in
his
answer
that
they
broke
into
the
apartment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
not
think
so.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
they
do
get
--
i
know
that
they
do
have
courses
for
them,
how
detailed,
you
know,
before
they
are
assigned.
i
have
it
myself
participated
at
some
of
those.
but
i
don't
know
how
detailed
they
get
in
their
instructions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
had
been
--
there's
been
some
--
i
think
mr.
bring
said
not
in
this
statute,
but
that
there
had
been
some
of
the
commentators
had
suggested
that
it
should
be
given
that
same
construction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
there
have
been
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
held
that
it
is
the
breaking
to
open
an
unlocked
door.
there
are
cases
in
the
second
and
the
sixth
and
at
other
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
held
that
is
not
the
rule.
no
case
decided
by
this
court
has
passed
on
a
question.
i
would
submit
that
the
considerations
involved,
where
you're
talking
about
burglary,
are
entirely
different
from
the
considerations
that
are
involved
when
you're
talking
about
the
right
of
an
agent
or
police
officer
to
arrest.
the
burglar
has
absolutely
no
right
to
enter
an
apartment.
by
the
terms
of
most
burglary
statutes,
it
only
applies
when
he
is
not
only
entering,
but
entering
for
some
unlawful
purpose.
so
the
society
has
every
right
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
burglar,
and
has
every
right
to
apply
its
laws
very
rigorously
to
prevent
his
entry.
the
other
hand,
an
agent
going
to
search
or
to
make
a
valid
arrest,
has
a
right
to
be
admitted.
he
cannot
be
excluded,
so
that
the
context
is
so
entirely
different
that
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
construe
the
use
of
the
word
as
the
same
in
both
situations.
i
think
--
well,
it
might
be
argued
in
the
state
case
that
a
state
policeman
dealing
with
the
question
of
burglary
on
a
day
to
day
basis
should
understand
breaking
as
a
--
as
it's
understood
in
the
burglary
statute.
we
are
here,
dealing
with
the
statute
directed,
to
provide
directions
for
federal
officers
who
don't
handle
common
law
crimes
such
as
burglary.
there's
no
reason
to
suspect
that
those
agents
will
have
in
mind
the
concept
of
breaking
as
it's
used
in
a
burglary
statute
when
they
read
the
statute,
and
try
and
conform
their
conduct
to
the
standards
which
it
prescribes.
i
think
that
they
would
understand.
the
agents
who
made
this
arrest
would
have
understood
the
statute
as
to
not
require
an
announcement,
because
i
don't
think
they
considered
that
they
were
breaking
into
this
apartment
when
they
opened,
entered
through
the
unlocked
door.
however,
even
if
this
court
were
to
reject
our
contention
in
this
regard,
and
hold
that
an
announcement
is
required
before
opening
an
unlocked
door,
i
think
there
are
circumstances
here
which
would
have
justified
the
officers
in
breaking
into
this
apartment
without
announcing
their
purpose.
now,
here
again,
i
must
state
that
because
this
was
not
developed
--
this
contention
was
not
developed
in
the
trial
court
--
the
record
is
only
scanty
on
this.
we
have
to
lean
through
and
find
passages
where
the
agents
weren't
concerned
about
this
question,
but
which
where
they
may
have
mentioned
the
fact,
which
throws
some
light
on
the
subject.
there
are
two
such
passages
contained
in
the
record.
first,
there
is
i
think
the
entire
posture
of
the
record.
at
the
time
the
agents
entered,
they
knew
that
the
informant
was
inside.
the
informant
had
been
inside
for
five
minutes.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
agents
in
no
circumstances,
to
realize
that
if
they
knocked,
and
announced
that
they
were
there
to
arrest,
that
the
petitioner
might
have
immediately
expected
that
the
agents
upcoming
so
closely
on
jones's
heels,
it
was
obvious
that
jones
was
working
with
them.
and
if
petitioner
had
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
the
agents
could
have
expected
that
he
might,
if
he
was
armed,
take
some
effort
either
to
injure
jones,
or
to
use
jones
as
a
hostage,
in
an
attempt
to
resist
arrest.
i
think
also
when
you're
dealing
with
a
crime
such
as
a
narcotics
violation
which
carries
such
heavy
penalties
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that
they
could
have
feared
that
he
might
realize
why
they're
going
in,
and
take
some
action
to
harm
jones.
and
i
think
rather
than
take
that
risk
of
harm
to
jones
they
were
justified
in
going
in
without
announcing
their
purpose.
i
think
that
it's
also
possible,
as
i
say
that
when
you're
dealing
with
something
like
a
narcotics
statute,
which
has
mandatory
five-year
penalty,
and
penalties
running
up
to
20
years,
it's
not
unreasonable
for
the
agents
to
assume
that
if
they
announced
their
purpose,
the
party
within
may
take
some
action
to
resist
arrest.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that
when
you
have
an
undercover
agent
inside,
it
does
add
an
element
of
risk
that
the
agents
have
a
right
to
consider,
with
all
the
other
circumstances
they
may
know,
as
opposed
of
if
we
were
writing
on
a
totally
clean
slate
there
might
be
room
for
argument
that
anytime
agents
are
going
to
arrest
for
a
serious
crime,
where
there
is
--
there
might
be
some
basis
for
saying
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
announce
their
purpose.
i
looked
at
the
only
statistics
i
could
find
on
this
with
the
fbi
statistics
for
60
to
66,
a
105
policemen
were
killed
in
making
arrest.
i
think
that
that's
when
you
realize
that
there
is
an
incident
of
violence
accompanying
attempts
to
arrest
people
for
serious
crime,
that
that
is
something
that
the
agent
should
have
a
right
to
consider.
now,
maybe
that
they
would
know
--
they
would,
from
what
they
know
about
the
defendant,
they
would
know
they
have
no
reason
to
fear.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
case
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
point
that
the
only
two
things
in
the
record,
that,
i
think
in
any
way,
bear
upon
what
the
agents
were
thinking
about
at
this
time.
the
first
is
the
testimony
of
agent
hopkins
which
appears
at
page
26
of
the
appendix,
when
he
was
asked
what
happened
when
he
entered.
and
he
said,
upon
entering
the
apartment,
i
had
my
gun
drawn.?
obviously,
the
fact
that
he
had
his
gun
drawn
is
some
indication
of
his
state
of
mind
that
there
was
danger
involved
in
this
situation.
he
wasn't
going
in
to
arrest
somebody
for
income
tax
evasion,
or
failing
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
he
was
going
in,
in
a
situation
where
he
believed
there
was
danger.
the
other
factor
that
appears
in
the
record,
which
also
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
appears
in
the
appendix.
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
normal
initial
questioning
as
his
--
how
long
he
has
been
on
duty,
etcetera.
and
i
think
i've
--
i
did
read
that
on
the
--
in
this
case,
i
cannot
lay
my
hand
on
it,
though.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh
yes,
he
was.
and
this
was
that
--
he
was
a
customs
agent.
he
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation.
he
was
the
senior
agent
on
the
case.
and
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court,
the
other
piece
of
testimony
of
which
bears
on
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
customs
inspector,
port
investigator
carter,
who
testified
--
it
appears
on
page
46
of
the
appendix.
he
testified
that
when
he
went
in
to
the
apartment,
he
immediately
went
over,
he
noticed
jones
sitting
on
the
couch.
so
jones,
with
his
hand
under
the
cushion,
immediately
went
over,
and
removed
--
i'm
sorry,
not
jones,
the
petitioner.
so
the
petitioner
was
sitting
on
the
couch
with
his
hand
under
the
under
cushion,
he
went
over,
and
immediately
removed
the
petitioner
from
the
area
of
the
couch.
he
was
asked
why
he
did
this,
and
his
answer
was,
it
appears
on
page
46,
i
didn't
know
particularly
what
was
underneath
the
cushion.
my
feeling
was
that
possibly,
it
could
have
been
a
weapon
of
some
type.
so,
it's
obvious
that
at
least
to
this
member
of
the
arresting
team,
there
was
some
reason
to
suspect
or
to
fear
that
the
petitioner
was
armed.
it's
obvious
that
the
agent
in
charge,
who
went
in
with
his
gun
drawn,
was
expecting
some
danger.
the
situation
just
on
its
face
does
indicate
there
is
a
substantial
danger,
and
if
the
petitioner
is
armed,
he
will
either
resist
arrest,
or
injure
the
informant,
who
has
been
left
in
the
apartment.
i
think
that
under
the
--
that
these
circumstances
would
justify
the
officers
in
not
announcing
their
purpose
before
they
entered,
even
if
the
door
had
been
locked.
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
the
manner
of
arrest
here
was
entirely
proper.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
not
know
of
any
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
i
think
--
well,
there
are
some
indications
that
--
it's
says,
so
far,
it
was
left
open
in
miller.
the
court
recognized
that
it
had
been
held
in
some
instances.
that
was,
in
so
far
as
this
case
was
concerned,
i
believe
your
honor's
opinion
in
ker
--
of
course
not
dealing
with
the
statute,
expressly
recognized
the
right
to
protect
a
person
within.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
but
here
again,
i
would
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
here
again,
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
it's
--
that
the
full
statute
need
not
necessarily
apply
here.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
is
drawn
to
cover
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that
congress
--
i'm
sure
that
congress
focused
its
attention
on
arrest
specifically
and
thought
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
would
totally
govern
the
arrest.
they
would
have
focused
on
this
problem.
i'm
sure
that
the
congress
would
not
expect
that
the
fbi
should
before
announcing
--
arresting
any
one
of
the
10
most
wanted
men
in
the
country,
knock
on
the
door,
and
tell
them
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
there
for.
so,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
apply
this
statute
over
fully.
i
do
think
that
in
so
far
as
it
talks
about
breaking
in
what,
and
enunciates
the
--
you
know,
what
a
breaking
is,
or
gives
any
indication
of
that
i
think
it
embodies
a
constitutional
standard
which
should
be
applied.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
provide
an
exception
here,
should
be
held
controlling.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
these
--
i
think
the
statute
is
only
is
a
guideline.
i
think
that
the
statute
that
the
court
in
miller
looked
to
this
and
said
that
the
statue
involved
general
principles.
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
is
per
se
controlling,
no.
i
think
it's
control
--
is
only
indicative
of
what
the
law
really
is
the
constitution
requirement
is,
i
think
it
embodies
the
constitutional
requirement
in
so
far
as
breaking
is
concerned.
i
don't
think
it
involves
so
many
exceptions
that
might
exist
under
the
constitution,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
that's
why
it's
never
clearly
been
framed
because
in
miller,
it
was
more
supervisory,
that
the
opinion
was
cast
more
in
supervisory
terms.
of
course
in
ker,
the
statute
didn't
apply.
it's
the
only
two
cases
that
really
considered
this
issue
previously.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bring
has
made
a
rather
eloquent
argument
that
the
arrest
here
was
invalid
because
of
the
failure
of
the
agents
involved
to
announce
their
purpose
before
entering
the
petitioner's
apartment.
however,
at
the
outset
i
feel
called
upon
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
that
very
eloquent
argument
was
not
made
in
the
trial
court.
to
that
reason,
that
issue
should
not
be
considered
by
this
court.
now,
in
making
this
argument
in
this
case,
we're
not
just
merely
seeking
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
decided
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
not,
i
think
under
the
analogy
to
the
(inaudible)
decision
that
the
problem
is
that
this
argument
depends
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
and
petitioner's
failure
to
make
this
contention
in
the
district
court
deprive
the
government
of
the
opportunity
to
make
the
record
on
which
this
court
could
adequately
judge,
one;
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
an
announcement
of
purpose.
i
think
your
honor's
opinion
in
warden
v.
hayden
recognizes
the
fact
that
quite
often
the
fact
that
an
agent
doesn't
testify
or
policeman
doesn't
testify
to
a
particular
fact,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
that
fact
did
not
occur.
i
think
anyone
who's
tried
a
lawsuit
realizes
hard
enough
to
get
witnesses
to
testify
the
facts
of
the
material
to
be
issued
before
the
court
and
it
often
happens
that
facts
and
not
the
material
are
not
covered
in
testimonies,
that?s
a
possibility
here.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
do
refer
to
it
in
the
brief
and
we
cite
the
(inaudible)
case
which
stands
exactly
this
principle.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
done
in
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
important
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
it's
important
particularly
in
light
of
the
whole
question
that
is
raised
in
the
last
part
of
mr.
bring's
argument
concerning
the
possible
exigent
circumstances
that
might
have
justified
why
the
agents
--
if
we
assume
from
it
they
didn't
announce.
why
didn't
they?
well,
of
course
mr.
bring
said
the
record
doesn't
contain
anything.
well,
i'll
come
to
--
wanted
to
minor
items
in
the
record
they
do
have
some
bearing
on
it.
but
generally,
the
reason,
the
record
doesn't
contain
anything
on
this
issue
is
that
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress
made
prior
to
trial.
the
first
time
any
mention
of
a
move
to
suppress
this
evidence
came
was
at
the
exact
close
of
the
government's
case
after
the
arresting
agent
had
testified
and
then
cross-examined.
it
was
at
that
point,
that
counsel
got
up
and
his
objection
appears
at
the
page
28
or
29
in
the
record.
and
it
is
just
clear
from
reading
that
objection
that
in
making
the
objection
he
in
no
way
prior
to
the
prosecution
or
the
court
--
that
he
was
objecting
to
the
manner
of
entry.
to
clear
from
reading
his
objection,
the
only
thing
he
was
focusing
on
was
the
presence
or
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
page
28
to
29
of
the
appendix.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
now,
i
think
that
we
have
here
what
was
present
in
(inaudible)
where
the
government
attempted
the
argument
in
this
case
that
even
though
the
arrest
warrant
was
invalid,
the
court
should
consider
it
whether
or
not
the
arrest
was
proper
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
which
the
aids
may
have
had.
in
that
case,
this
court
speaking
to
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
to
permit
the
government
to
inject
its
new
theory
into
the
case
at
this
stage
would
unfairly
deprive
the
petitioner
of
adequate
opportunity
to
respond.
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here,
the
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
make
the
objection
of
the
district
court
where
the
record
is
made,
deprived
the
government
of
the
opportunity
to
show
exactly
what
happened
at
the
time
of
that
arrest
and
the
exact
reasons
why
the
agents
acted
as
they
did.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
could
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
he
said
the
appellant
raised
the
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
the
client
mr.
justice
white
that
i
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
came
out
of
the
court
that
the
record
was
not
adequate
to
reach
the
full
merits.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i'm
not
sure
of.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
should
determine
the
issue
when
you
have
problem
here,
as
i
said
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
it
is
somewhat
difficult
but
i
do
think
when
you
have
a
situation
such
as
this
where
so
much
depends
upon
the
record.
i
would
assume
i
would
agree
with
you
totally
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
announcement.
i
think
if
we
accept
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
stated
the
record
on
that
then
yes,
but
i
think
the
whole
problem
of
the
exigent
circumstances
is
one
that
so
clearly
depends
upon
the
record.
and
so
clearly
not
developed
here,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
and
he
said
i
knocked
and
went
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
turn
into
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
petitioner
has
--
the
petitioner
contends
that
because
the
agents
did
not
announce
their
purpose
when
they
entered
the
apartment
the
arrest
was
invalid.
we
submit
two
contentions
in
response
to
that.
first,
we
contend
that
nothing
in
either
the
constitution,
the
case
is
decided
by
this
court
where
the
relevant
statute
requires
an
agent
who's
affecting
an
arrest
to
announce
his
purpose
before
opening
an
unlocked
door.
second,
we
contend
that
even
in
this
record,
there
are
sufficient
facts
to
show
that
the
agents
would
be
justified
in
not
announcing
their
purpose
before
entering
the
apartment
in
this
case.
first
i
think
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
statute
if
i
may.
i
think
both
parties
before
the
court
have
conceded
that
in
general,
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
statute
governed
the
decision
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
think
this
was
recognized
in
miller.
i
think
it
might
occur
where
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
constitution,
the
requirement
of
announcement
has
constitutional
overtones.
however,
i
don't
think
having
said
that,
that
we
can
necessarily
accept
the
fact
that
this
statute
totally
controls
the
question
of
arrest.
obviously,
the
statue
was
not
drafted
with
the
problems
of
arrest
in
mind
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas
question
about
the
statue
and
it
does
not
say
anything
about
an
exception
for
agents
who
might
be
endangered.
their
own
lives
might
be
in
danger
in
affecting
the
arrest.
it
does
refer
to
people
who
might
be
inside
when
the
search
is
being
conducted
and
might
be
in
danger.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
that
the
congress
was
not
concerned,
was
not
addressing
itself
to
a
search
situation.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
the
statute
completely
controls
the
situation
here.
i
do
think
that
in
so
far
as
it
talks
about
the
need
to
announce
the
purpose
before
breaking
in,
it
embodies
a
concept
which
certainly
in
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned
this
court
decision
in
miller
makes
clear
is
a
governing
standard
and
as
i
say
has
constitutional
overtones.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
in
what
is
involved
here.
one,
i
think
the
question
is
mr.
bring
has
argued
in
his
brief
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
privacy
not
property.
certainly,
that's
conceded
by
the
government
in
all
situation,
we
are
talking
about
the
right
of
the
government
to
enter.
the
fourth
amendment
said
some
of
the
requirements
when
they
can
enter
and
when
they
can
breach
a
person's
privacy.
when
a
private
premises
can
be
invaded
by
the
government.
so
in
so
far
as
it
requires
a
warrant
or
arrest
pursuant
to
probable
cause
to
justify
the
intrusion,
that's
clearly
concerned
more
with
privacy
than
property.
i
think
the
historical
development
of
the
announcement
rule
as
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
indicates
that
that
part
of
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
is
more
closely
related
to
the
question
of
property
than
privacy.
but
certainly
it
does
have
some
function
with
regard
to
privacy.
in
that,
it
gives
notice
to
the
person
with
and
that
the
agents
are
seeking
--
someone
is
seeking
to
enter.
but
it's
a
fairly
limited
protection
of
privacy
since
the
agents
have
the
right
to
enter
immediately.
so
i
think
there's
no
question
that
you
will
here
face
with
the
problem
of
drawing
a
line.
i
would
concede
that
if
the
agents
open
a
locked
door
with
a
passkey
that
is
breaking.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly.
i
think
that
when
the
person
locks
the
door
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that
it's
common
experience.
i
think
that
the
rule
that
says
that
when
you
open
an
unlocked
door,
that's
not
a
breaking.
it
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
invasion
of
privacy
beyond
that
which
is
expected
in
the
normal
social
and
business
setting.
i
think
that
most
people
i
think
it's
common
experience
if
you
go
to
someone's
apartment
or
home
looking
for
them,
expecting
them
to
be
there,
you
knock
on
the
door,
you
receive
no
response,
it's
not
un
-ordinary
for
people
in
that
situation
to
open
and
try
the
door.
and
if
it's
open
to
walk
in
and
perhaps
went
inside
to
call
out
but
the
person
has
the
right
to
protect
his
privacy
if
he
wants
by
locking
that
door.
and
once
he
has
done
that,
he's
indicated
to
the
world
that
he
wants
his
privacy
protected,
and
he
doesn't
want
people
coming
in,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction
that
exists
here.
i
think
also
you
have
to
distinguish
the
case
here
on
the
basis
of
that
--
the
statute,
the
rule
is
designed
to
provide
guidance
to
law
enforcement
officers
in
making
an
arrest,
executing
a
warrant.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
say
deprived.
i
think
that
that
home
is
a
home
that
has
taken
the
risk
because
it
wants
to
allow
its
children
to
go
freely,
their
children
and
other
children,
and
other
people
coming
to
the
door
may
open
the
door.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
not
lawlessness.
i
know,
i
don't
think,
i
think
that
it
takes
the
risk
that
people
in
society
who
come
to
the
door,
find
no
one,
knock,
will
open
the
door.
that's
what
was
done
here.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
may
not
be
an
invitation
to
anyone
to
come
in
but
it
has
to
reasonably
expected
that
that
may
happen.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
--
there
is
some
question
about
the?
i
think
this
court's
opinion
in
katz
certainly
makes
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
with
what
a
person's
reasonable
expectations
will
be,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
a
person's
expectation
that
nobody
is
going
to
come
into
his
apartment
is
much
greater
when
he
locks
the
door
than
when
he
leaves
the
door
open
or
he
leaves
it
ajar.
of
course,
with
dealing
and
you
know,
it's
a
fine
line
that
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
i'll
turn
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
statute
contemplates
more
than
just
opening
an
unlocked
door?
i
think
that
the
common
law
and
history
of
the
statute,
the
constitutional
requirement,
indicated
that
the
sheriff
at
common
law
was
justified
that
he
only
had
to
announce
his
purpose
if
he
was
physically
breaking
into
the
premises.
i
think
that
you'll
have
to
read
the
statute
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
miller
doesn't
deal
with
--
i'm
sorry,
i
though
you
said
if
you
said
did
our
case
didn't
support
that.
i
thought
--
no
case
before
this
court
has
ever
considered
the
issue.
i
think
there
are
cases,
we've
cited
them
in
our
brief.
symayne's
case
which
we
cite
for
example,
indicates
clearly
that
the
common
law,
the
sheriff
did
have
the
right
to
go
into
an
unlocked
door
and
that
it
only
had
to
announce
if
the
door
was
locked,
before
he
broke
in.
i
think
the
statute
itself
in
its
own
terms
when
it
talks
about
breaking
not
only
the
door,
but
any
door
inside,
or
anything
contained
therein,
clearly
indicates
that
congress
was
contemplating
some
forcible
type
of
entry
because
i
don't
think
that
normally
the
agent
would
expect
once
he
was
inside
of
premises
and
wanted
to
open
the
door,
before
using
the
force
to
pull
that
door
open,
he
had
to
announce
his
purpose.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
that
out.
i
think
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
kept
in
mind,
with
regard
to
this
requirement,
to
direction
to
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
we
have
to
read
the
statute
then,
as
it
would
reasonably
be
understood
by
the
officer
who
is
executing
the
warrant
of
making
the
arrest.
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
agent
who
opened
the
unlocked
door
in
this
case
thought
that
he
was
breaking
into
the
apartment.
that
fact
is
somewhat
corroborated
by
testimony
at
the
trial.
on
page
25
of
the
appendix,
the
agent
who
was
the
chief
agent
in
charge
of
the
investigation
who
made
the
arrest
was
being
questioned,
and
on
cross-examination
by
petitioner's
trial
counsel
--
and
counsel
said,?
by
the
way,
how
is
mr.
sabbath
dressed
when
you
broke
into
the
apartment??
the
agent
answered
by
saying.
when
we
entered
the
apartment,
mr.
sabbath--?
and
said
how
he
was
dressed.
i
think
the
agent
resisted
the
suggestion
in
his
answer
that
they
broke
into
the
apartment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
not
think
so.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
they
do
get
--
i
know
that
they
do
have
courses
for
them,
how
detailed,
you
know,
before
they
are
assigned.
i
have
it
myself
participated
at
some
of
those.
but
i
don't
know
how
detailed
they
get
in
their
instructions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
had
been
--
there's
been
some
--
i
think
mr.
bring
said
not
in
this
statute,
but
that
there
had
been
some
of
the
commentators
had
suggested
that
it
should
be
given
that
same
construction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
there
have
been
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
held
that
it
is
the
breaking
to
open
an
unlocked
door.
there
are
cases
in
the
second
and
the
sixth
and
at
other
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
held
that
is
not
the
rule.
no
case
decided
by
this
court
has
passed
on
a
question.
i
would
submit
that
the
considerations
involved,
where
you're
talking
about
burglary,
are
entirely
different
from
the
considerations
that
are
involved
when
you're
talking
about
the
right
of
an
agent
or
police
officer
to
arrest.
the
burglar
has
absolutely
no
right
to
enter
an
apartment.
by
the
terms
of
most
burglary
statutes,
it
only
applies
when
he
is
not
only
entering,
but
entering
for
some
unlawful
purpose.
so
the
society
has
every
right
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
burglar,
and
has
every
right
to
apply
its
laws
very
rigorously
to
prevent
his
entry.
the
other
hand,
an
agent
going
to
search
or
to
make
a
valid
arrest,
has
a
right
to
be
admitted.
he
cannot
be
excluded,
so
that
the
context
is
so
entirely
different
that
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
construe
the
use
of
the
word
as
the
same
in
both
situations.
i
think
--
well,
it
might
be
argued
in
the
state
case
that
a
state
policeman
dealing
with
the
question
of
burglary
on
a
day
to
day
basis
should
understand
breaking
as
a
--
as
it's
understood
in
the
burglary
statute.
we
are
here,
dealing
with
the
statute
directed,
to
provide
directions
for
federal
officers
who
don't
handle
common
law
crimes
such
as
burglary.
there's
no
reason
to
suspect
that
those
agents
will
have
in
mind
the
concept
of
breaking
as
it's
used
in
a
burglary
statute
when
they
read
the
statute,
and
try
and
conform
their
conduct
to
the
standards
which
it
prescribes.
i
think
that
they
would
understand.
the
agents
who
made
this
arrest
would
have
understood
the
statute
as
to
not
require
an
announcement,
because
i
don't
think
they
considered
that
they
were
breaking
into
this
apartment
when
they
opened,
entered
through
the
unlocked
door.
however,
even
if
this
court
were
to
reject
our
contention
in
this
regard,
and
hold
that
an
announcement
is
required
before
opening
an
unlocked
door,
i
think
there
are
circumstances
here
which
would
have
justified
the
officers
in
breaking
into
this
apartment
without
announcing
their
purpose.
now,
here
again,
i
must
state
that
because
this
was
not
developed
--
this
contention
was
not
developed
in
the
trial
court
--
the
record
is
only
scanty
on
this.
we
have
to
lean
through
and
find
passages
where
the
agents
weren't
concerned
about
this
question,
but
which
where
they
may
have
mentioned
the
fact,
which
throws
some
light
on
the
subject.
there
are
two
such
passages
contained
in
the
record.
first,
there
is
i
think
the
entire
posture
of
the
record.
at
the
time
the
agents
entered,
they
knew
that
the
informant
was
inside.
the
informant
had
been
inside
for
five
minutes.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
agents
in
no
circumstances,
to
realize
that
if
they
knocked,
and
announced
that
they
were
there
to
arrest,
that
the
petitioner
might
have
immediately
expected
that
the
agents
upcoming
so
closely
on
jones's
heels,
it
was
obvious
that
jones
was
working
with
them.
and
if
petitioner
had
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
the
agents
could
have
expected
that
he
might,
if
he
was
armed,
take
some
effort
either
to
injure
jones,
or
to
use
jones
as
a
hostage,
in
an
attempt
to
resist
arrest.
i
think
also
when
you're
dealing
with
a
crime
such
as
a
narcotics
violation
which
carries
such
heavy
penalties
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that
they
could
have
feared
that
he
might
realize
why
they're
going
in,
and
take
some
action
to
harm
jones.
and
i
think
rather
than
take
that
risk
of
harm
to
jones
they
were
justified
in
going
in
without
announcing
their
purpose.
i
think
that
it's
also
possible,
as
i
say
that
when
you're
dealing
with
something
like
a
narcotics
statute,
which
has
mandatory
five-year
penalty,
and
penalties
running
up
to
20
years,
it's
not
unreasonable
for
the
agents
to
assume
that
if
they
announced
their
purpose,
the
party
within
may
take
some
action
to
resist
arrest.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that
when
you
have
an
undercover
agent
inside,
it
does
add
an
element
of
risk
that
the
agents
have
a
right
to
consider,
with
all
the
other
circumstances
they
may
know,
as
opposed
of
if
we
were
writing
on
a
totally
clean
slate
there
might
be
room
for
argument
that
anytime
agents
are
going
to
arrest
for
a
serious
crime,
where
there
is
--
there
might
be
some
basis
for
saying
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
announce
their
purpose.
i
looked
at
the
only
statistics
i
could
find
on
this
with
the
fbi
statistics
for
60
to
66,
a
105
policemen
were
killed
in
making
arrest.
i
think
that
that's
when
you
realize
that
there
is
an
incident
of
violence
accompanying
attempts
to
arrest
people
for
serious
crime,
that
that
is
something
that
the
agent
should
have
a
right
to
consider.
now,
maybe
that
they
would
know
--
they
would,
from
what
they
know
about
the
defendant,
they
would
know
they
have
no
reason
to
fear.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
case
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
point
that
the
only
two
things
in
the
record,
that,
i
think
in
any
way,
bear
upon
what
the
agents
were
thinking
about
at
this
time.
the
first
is
the
testimony
of
agent
hopkins
which
appears
at
page
26
of
the
appendix,
when
he
was
asked
what
happened
when
he
entered.
and
he
said,
upon
entering
the
apartment,
i
had
my
gun
drawn.?
obviously,
the
fact
that
he
had
his
gun
drawn
is
some
indication
of
his
state
of
mind
that
there
was
danger
involved
in
this
situation.
he
wasn't
going
in
to
arrest
somebody
for
income
tax
evasion,
or
failing
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
he
was
going
in,
in
a
situation
where
he
believed
there
was
danger.
the
other
factor
that
appears
in
the
record,
which
also
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
appears
in
the
appendix.
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
normal
initial
questioning
as
his
--
how
long
he
has
been
on
duty,
etcetera.
and
i
think
i've
--
i
did
read
that
on
the
--
in
this
case,
i
cannot
lay
my
hand
on
it,
though.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh
yes,
he
was.
and
this
was
that
--
he
was
a
customs
agent.
he
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation.
he
was
the
senior
agent
on
the
case.
and
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court,
the
other
piece
of
testimony
of
which
bears
on
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
customs
inspector,
port
investigator
carter,
who
testified
--
it
appears
on
page
46
of
the
appendix.
he
testified
that
when
he
went
in
to
the
apartment,
he
immediately
went
over,
he
noticed
jones
sitting
on
the
couch.
so
jones,
with
his
hand
under
the
cushion,
immediately
went
over,
and
removed
--
i'm
sorry,
not
jones,
the
petitioner.
so
the
petitioner
was
sitting
on
the
couch
with
his
hand
under
the
under
cushion,
he
went
over,
and
immediately
removed
the
petitioner
from
the
area
of
the
couch.
he
was
asked
why
he
did
this,
and
his
answer
was,
it
appears
on
page
46,
i
didn't
know
particularly
what
was
underneath
the
cushion.
my
feeling
was
that
possibly,
it
could
have
been
a
weapon
of
some
type.
so,
it's
obvious
that
at
least
to
this
member
of
the
arresting
team,
there
was
some
reason
to
suspect
or
to
fear
that
the
petitioner
was
armed.
it's
obvious
that
the
agent
in
charge,
who
went
in
with
his
gun
drawn,
was
expecting
some
danger.
the
situation
just
on
its
face
does
indicate
there
is
a
substantial
danger,
and
if
the
petitioner
is
armed,
he
will
either
resist
arrest,
or
injure
the
informant,
who
has
been
left
in
the
apartment.
i
think
that
under
the
--
that
these
circumstances
would
justify
the
officers
in
not
announcing
their
purpose
before
they
entered,
even
if
the
door
had
been
locked.
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
the
manner
of
arrest
here
was
entirely
proper.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
not
know
of
any
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
i
think
--
well,
there
are
some
indications
that
--
it's
says,
so
far,
it
was
left
open
in
miller.
the
court
recognized
that
it
had
been
held
in
some
instances.
that
was,
in
so
far
as
this
case
was
concerned,
i
believe
your
honor's
opinion
in
ker
--
of
course
not
dealing
with
the
statute,
expressly
recognized
the
right
to
protect
a
person
within.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
but
here
again,
i
would
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
here
again,
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
it's
--
that
the
full
statute
need
not
necessarily
apply
here.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
is
drawn
to
cover
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that
congress
--
i'm
sure
that
congress
focused
its
attention
on
arrest
specifically
and
thought
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
would
totally
govern
the
arrest.
they
would
have
focused
on
this
problem.
i'm
sure
that
the
congress
would
not
expect
that
the
fbi
should
before
announcing
--
arresting
any
one
of
the
10
most
wanted
men
in
the
country,
knock
on
the
door,
and
tell
them
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
there
for.
so,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
apply
this
statute
over
fully.
i
do
think
that
in
so
far
as
it
talks
about
breaking
in
what,
and
enunciates
the
--
you
know,
what
a
breaking
is,
or
gives
any
indication
of
that
i
think
it
embodies
a
constitutional
standard
which
should
be
applied.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
provide
an
exception
here,
should
be
held
controlling.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
these
--
i
think
the
statute
is
only
is
a
guideline.
i
think
that
the
statute
that
the
court
in
miller
looked
to
this
and
said
that
the
statue
involved
general
principles.
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
is
per
se
controlling,
no.
i
think
it's
control
--
is
only
indicative
of
what
the
law
really
is
the
constitution
requirement
is,
i
think
it
embodies
the
constitutional
requirement
in
so
far
as
breaking
is
concerned.
i
don't
think
it
involves
so
many
exceptions
that
might
exist
under
the
constitution,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
that's
why
it's
never
clearly
been
framed
because
in
miller,
it
was
more
supervisory,
that
the
opinion
was
cast
more
in
supervisory
terms.
of
course
in
ker,
the
statute
didn't
apply.
it's
the
only
two
cases
that
really
considered
this
issue
previously.
