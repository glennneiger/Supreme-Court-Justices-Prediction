mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
important
question
of
statutory
interpretation
with
respect
to
a
constitutionally
inspired
federal
statue
that
governs
the
conduct
of
federal
officers
when
they
made
or
are
required
to
break
in
to
a
private
dwelling
in
order
to
affect
another
wise
lawful
arrest.
also
involved
in
the
case
is
a
question
whether
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
federal
officers
may
force
their
way
into
a
private
dwelling
at
night
in
order
to
make
an
arrest
with
other
warrant
under
circumstances
which
did
not
excuse
their
failure
to
obtain
the
warrant.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
complicated
and
maybe
briefly
summarized
as
follows;
on
saturday
evening
february
19th,
1966,
a
man
by
the
name
of
edward
jones
was
entering
the
united
states
from
mexico
at
the
san
ysidro,
california
port
of
entry.
he
was
stopped
by
custom
officials
and
was
searched,
whereupon
the
customs
officials
discovered
a
container
of
cocaine
concealed
in
his
undershorts.
they
immediately
arrested
him
for
violations
of
the
narcotics
laws.
and
thereupon,
they
began
a
process
of
interrogation.
initially,
mr.
jones
denied
that
he
was
involved
in
this
elicit
transaction
with
anyone
else
but
after
about
three
or
four
hours
of
interrogation,
he
admitted
to
the
customs
officers
that
he
had
actually
been
taken
to
mexico
on
the
preceding
day
by
a
person
named
johnny,
that
johnny
had
hired
him
to
pick
up
the
narcotics
and
bring
them
back
to
los
angeles
for
delivery
to
johnny
and
that
johnny
had
promised
to
pay
him
$100
if
he
did
so.
at
that
point,
the
customs
officials
transported
jones
from
san
diego
to
los
angeles
and
at
approximately
at
3
o?clock
in
the
morning,
jones
in
the
presence
of
the
customs
officers
try
to
telephone
a
number
in
los
angeles
which
was
written
on
a
card
that
the
police
officers
found
in
jones?s
possession
when
he
was
arrested,
also
on
a
card
was
the
named
johnny.
no
one
answered
that
telephone
call
and
three
or
four
other
attempts
were
made
to
call
that
number
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
sunday,
february
20th
and
again
no
answer
was
obtained.
the
officers
then
for
some
reason
which
is
undisclosed
by
the
record
transported
jones
back
to
san
diego.
at
3:00
pm
on
the
following
afternoon,
the
officers
again
invited
jones
to
try
and
call
the
number
in
los
angeles.
on
this
occasion,
the
call
was
answered
by
a
male
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
jones
identified
himself
as
bj
and
addressed
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
telephone
as
johnny.
he
indicated
that
he
was
still
in
san
diego
and
that
he
still
had
the
thing.
johnny
then
inquired
whether
jones
had
any
trouble
in
crossing
the
line.
jones
indicated
that
he
had
not
and
johnny
said
that
he
had
been
arrested
when
he
had
been
down
in
mexico
and
that
was
the
reason
he
was
curious
as
to
whether
or
not
jones
had
had
any
trouble.
jones
inquired
whether
johnny
was
going
to
be
in
hes
apartment
and
when
johnny
said
he
would,
jones
said
well
i'll
come
up
to
los
angeles
to
your
apartment.
at
that
point,
the
agents
did
not
attempt
to
verify
any
further
any
of
the
information
which
had
been
given
to
them
by
jones
who
dwell
all
intents
and
purposes
was
an
unreliable
informant
nor
did
they
go
to
a
magistrate
in
an
effort
to
try
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
johnny's
arrest.
rather
they
transported
jones
to
los
angeles.
they
went
to
the
location
where
johnny's
apartment
was.
they
outfitted
jones
with
an
electronic
transmitting
device
and
they
returned
the
container
of
cocaine
to
jones
and
sent
him
to
johnny?s
apartment.
at
this
time
the
officers
of
which
there
were
four
or
five
in
number
took
up
positions
near
the
apartment.
and
they
attempted
to
overhear
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
jones
and
people
inside
of
the
apartment.
jones
went
to
the
apartment,
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
door
was
answered
by
a
woman
who
was
visiting
johnny
at
that
time.
jones
asked
if
johnny
was
in
and
the
lady
said
that
he
was
and
that
she
would
get
him.
jones
then
went
into
the
apartment
and
the
lady
closed
the
door
to
the
apartment.
now,
this
much
of
the
conversation
was
overheard
by
the
officers
who
were
listening
to
the
electronic
transmitting
device.
when
jones
went
into
the
apartment,
the
lady
who
was
there
called
johnny
who
turned
out
to
be
petitioner,
from
the
bedroom
and
he
came
in
to
the
living
room
and
met
with
jones.
the
conversation
that
followed
was
not
overheard
by
the
police
officers
because
there
was
music
being
played
in
the
background
and
this
drowned
out
their
ability
to
hear
the
conversation
over
the
electronic
transmitting
device.
apparently,
the
officers
in
los
angeles
did
not
have
available
to
them
some
of
the
more
sophisticated
means
of
bugging
that
this
court
has
just
heard
about
and
they
therefore
were
frustrated
in
their
efforts
to
hear
what
went
on
in
the
apartment
and
to
make
the
recording
of
that
conversation.
one
of
the
officers
did
testify
that
he
heard
one
of
the
people
in
the
apartment
mentioned
the
word
?package?
though
he
could
not
identify
which
of
the
two
people
mentioned
that
word.
and
the
other
person
made
a
response,
though
he
also
could
not
identify
or
make
out
what
the
response
was.
at
this
point
after
jones
had
been
in
the
apartment
for
approximately
five
to
ten
minutes,
the
officers
decided
that
because
they
could
not
make
a
recording
of
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
within
the
apartment
that
they
should
then
proceed
into
the
apartment
to
make
the
arrest.
three
or
four
officers
approached
the
door
of
the
apartment.
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
group
knocked
on
the
door,
waited
a
few
seconds,
when
there
was
no
reply,
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door,
the
door
being
unlocked
he
opened
it
and
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
his
gun
drawn.
he
was
immediately
followed
by
two
or
three
other
officers
at
least
one
of
who,
also
had
his
gun
drawn.
there
was
no
announcement
by
the
police
at
least
the
record
discloses
that
their
was
no
announcement
by
the
police
that
any
of
the
officers
announced
who
they
were,
what
their
purpose
was
or
what
their
authority
was
before
entering
the
apartment.
once
inside
of
the
apartment,
the
officers
observed
petitioners
sitting
on
the
couch,
dressed
only
in
his
underclothes
and
jones
sitting
on
a
chair
next
to
the
couch.
as
they
entered
one
of
the
officers
indicated
that
he
saw
a
petitioner
withdraw
his
hand
from
underneath
the
cushion
of
the
couch.
they
immediately
announced
that
both
petitioner
and
jones
were
under
arrest.
they
took
petitioner
from
the
couch,
placed
him
against
the
wall,
put
him
in
handcuffs,
searched
him,
searched
jones
and
then
undertook
a
general
and
comprehensive
search
of
the
entire
apartment.
in
the
course
of
that
search,
they
found
the
container
of
narcotics
and
under
the
cushion
of
the
couch
near
where
the
petitioner
had
been
sitting.
they
also
found
in
other
rooms
of
the
apartment
certain
evidence
which
was
not
introduced
at
petitioners
trial
but
which
was
testified
about
specifically
some
squares,
aluminum
squares
and
some
balloons
which
the
police
officer
indicated
were
customarily
used
in
the
elicit
trade
of
narcotics.
the
officers
then
placed
both
petitioner
and
jones
under
arrest
and
took
them
from
the
apartment.
mr.
jones
did
not
have
on
his
person
the
$100.00
which
he
claimed
petitioner
had
promised
to
give
him
if
he
had
delivered
the
narcotics.
at
the
trial,
when
the
government
attempted
to
introduce
the
container
of
narcotics,
the
petitioners
counsel
objected
in
a
rather
general
fashion.
he
indicated
that
principally
the
police
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
enter
the
apartment
when
they
did
to
make
the
arrest.
he
also
objected
to
the
fact
that
the
police
entered
the
apartment
without
a
warrant
and
his
discussion
or
his
general
lodging
of
the
objection
also
contained
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
police
broke
into
the
apartment.
the
district
court
denied
the
objection,
had
admitted
the
narcotics
into
evidence
and
an
appeal
from
his
conviction.
the
conviction
was
affirmed,
the
court
of
appeals
sustaining
the
district
court's
admission
of
the
narcotics
into
evidence.
now,
the
petitioner
today
principally
contends
that
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
was
unlawful
and
that
the
search
which
was
conducted
subsequent
to
that
arrest
was
also
unlawful
thereby
requiring
that
the
narcotics
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
trial.
the
basic
reason
for
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
is
the
fact
that
the
officers
when
they
broke
in
to
petitioner's
apartment
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
18
usc
section
3109
which
indicates
that
an
officer
may
break
in
to
an
apartment
to
effect
an
arrest
but
only
if
he
first
announces
his
authority
and
his
purpose
for
breaking
in.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct
by
its
term
the
statue
would
not
seem
to
contemplate
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
on
the
other
hand,
that
specific
question
was
raised
in
united
states
against
miller
where
the
government
conceded
that
the
statute
does
apply
to
any
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
it
does
apply
to
that
kind
of
arrest.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
so
that
you
might
say
that
the
statue
has
been
extended
beyond
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
now
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
below,
both
take
the
position
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
there
was
not
a
breaking
open
of
the
apartment.
and
the
theory
upon
which
their
argument
rests
is
best
summarized
at
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
where
it
takes
the
position
that
in
common
understanding,
break
open
connotes
the
forcible
destruction
of
a
locked
door.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
government's
position
and
it
was
not
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
the
word
break
open
means
only
the
use
of
force
to
gain
access
to
a
private
dwelling
and
that
unless
force
is
used,
the
announcement
requirement
of
section
3109
is
not
applicable.
your
honors,
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
hyper-technical
and
detached
overly-strained
interpretation
of
the
words
break
open
and
it's
not
consistent
at
all
with
the
basic
objectives
which
the
announcement
requirement
of
section
3109
were
intended
to
serve.
mr.
or
judge
learned
hand
has
indicated
in
one
of
his
famous
decisions
that
the
art
of
interpretation
is
the
art
of
proliferating
a
purpose.
and
we
think
that
if
one
analyzes
what
the
purpose
of
section
3109
is,
what
the
purpose
of
the
announcement
requirement
is,
it
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
as
the
government
suggests
to
draw
a
distinction
between
forcibly
breaking
into
an
apartment
and
walking
through
a
closed
but
unlocked
door.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
interesting
a
lot
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
the
ninth
circuit
itself
has
so
held
that
if
a
police
officer
gains
access
by
using
a
passkey
to
open
the
door
that
somehow
that
is
brought
within
the
purview
of
section
3109
even
though
the
government
admits
there's
no
force
involved
there.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice.
there
it
seems
to
me
to
be
no
difference
if
forces
to
be
at
all
relevant
in
the
application
of
the
statutes,
whether
the
door
knob
is
turned
by
the
force
of
the
energy
of
the
hand
turning
the
knob
or
whether
it
passkey
is
use.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well
that
presents
a
more
difficult
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
not
in
terms
of
purpose,
no.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
would
make
the
same
argument
to
this
extent
that
the
objectives
of
the
statue
are
designed
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
occupant
of
the
home
and
to
prevent
violence
which
frequently
accompanies
unannounced
intrusions
into
the
home.
and
also
to
ensure
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
every
citizen
enjoys.
now,
one
of
the
door
is
open
or
closed
or
partially
secured
by
arrested
chain
or
whatever
the
situation
maybe,
those
objectives
it
seems
to
me
have
to
be
served
in
every
case
unless
there
are
some
indication
that
the
person
in
the
apartment
has
voluntarily
relinquished
his
privacy
or
has
invited
the
police
to
come
into
the
apartment.
now,
i
think
as
is
the
case
in
most
search
and
seizure
cases,
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
in
every
situation.
but
i
can
easily
conceive
of
the
case
in
which
the
door
would
be
open
in
which
the
statutory
requirement
should
apply.
for
example,
a
person
may
have
come
into
his
apartment
and
shut
the
door
closed
thinking
that
he
closed
it
but
in
fact
the
latch
didn?t
catch
and
a
gust
of
wind
may
have
come
along
and
opened
the
door
again.
the
person
then
goes
into
another
room
of
the
apartment
maybe
watching
television,
maybe
eating
dinner,
the
police
come,
they
see
the
door
open
and
they
walked
into
the
apartment.
now,
as
far
as
the
person
inside
the
apartment
is
concerned,
he
doesn't
know
who
those
people
are,
he
doesn't
know
why
they're
there.
he
has
not
invited
them
into
his
apartment.
they
have
invaded
his
privacy,
they
have
--
as
far
as
he
knows,
they
maybe
burglars,
they
may
burglars.
and
they
may
elicit
the
same
violent
response
that
any
unannounced
intrusion
into
the
home
may
elicit.
so
there,
the
situation
in
my
opinion
where
the
fact
that
the
door
open
does
not
eliminate
the
necessity
from
making
the
announcement
require
--
the
necessity
from
making
the
announcement.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
to
would
required
you
to
do
that
because
it
applies
both
to
outer
and
inner
doors
of
the
apartment.
again,
i
can
consider
situations
where
the
person
maybe
asleep
in
a
bedroom
and
the
door
to
which
it's
closed.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
hear
the
knock
of
the
outer
door
and
the
police
then
go
in
should
not
relieve
the
police,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
obligation
of
exercising
reasonable
caution
not
to
surprise
and
alarm
the
person
who
maybe
sleeping
in
the
bedroom.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
miller,
does
not
have
unreasonable
burden
of
the
statute
imposes
upon
the
police.
all
they
have
to
do
is
announce
who
they
are
and
why
they
are
there
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
yes,
i
think
there
are
some
exceptions.
at
least
i
can
conceive
the
situations
in
this
court
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
don't
--
well,
the
government
makes
the
argument
mr.
justice
white
that
there
were
so
called
exigent
circumstances
here
which
excuse
the
police
from
making
the
announcement.
it's
an
open
question
as
far
as
i
know
as
to
whether
this
statute
permits
exigent
circumstances
to
provide
an
exception
to
the
requirement.
in
miller,
the
court
held
that
that
was
open
question.
however,
in
ker
against
california,
when
a
similar
state
statute
was
being
considered
and
when
the
question
was
a
constitutional
requirement
imposed
upon
state
officers,
the
court
did
find
that
the
constitution
permitted
an
exception
for
certain
exigent
circumstances.
now,
the
only
one
that
the
government
alludes
to
in
this
case
is
the
possibility
that
the
police
were
concerned
over
the
safety
of
mr.
jones
who
was
in
the
apartment
and
whose
conversation
they
could
not
hear
about
and
also
to
the
possible
safety
of
themselves
in
going
into
an
apartment
but
first
having
to
announce
their
purpose
and
authority.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
can
conceive
of
the
situation
like
that
where
there
would
be
exigent
circumstances.
for
example,
they
knew
that
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
was
heavily
armed
and
had
a
prior
record
of
use
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
excuse
the
announcement.
in
my
own
opinion
though,
as
i
indicate
the
court
itself
has
never
gone
that
far
in
interpreting
the
requirements.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
i
wish
that
the
effort
would
be
made
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
facts.
the
record
discloses
no
facts
to
indicate
that
the
police
had
any
reasons
or
whatsoever
to
believe
that
jones
was
in
danger
or
that
they
themselves
would
have
been
in
danger.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
the
exception
of
the
kidnapper.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
court
did
so
in
ker
versus
california
while
it's
true
they
were
not
interpreting
this
specific
statue.
the
policy
reasons
which
they
articulated
in
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
that
case
indicate
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
it
would
be
unreasonable
or
unnecessary
for
the
police
to
make
the
announcement.
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
indicated
that
because
the
police
had
reasons
to
believe
that
the
announcement
would
have
facilitated
the
destruction
of
evidence
in
view
of
the
defendant's
prior
part
of
conduct
that
the
police
were
not
required
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
there's
no
doubt
your
honor
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
go
as
far
in
permitting
exceptions
to
the
statue
as
were
permitted
in
the
current
case
when
the
similar
requirement
was
then
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
certainly
have
no
objection
to
the
court
coming
out
with
a
broad
principle
in
this
case
which
and
i
think
in
fact
that
i
think
it
should
come
out
with
as
broad
as
principle
as
possible
which
would
require
the
police
to
make
the
announcement
in
every
case.
now,
it's
not
difficult
to
conceive
of
hundreds
of
different
types
of
factual
situations
where
making
the
announcement
might
be
imprudent
or
might
lead
to
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
might
lead
to
placing
somebody
in
physical
peril,
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
general
principle
ought
to
be
that
the
rule
of
announcement
should
be
imposed
and
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
government
to
establish
through
very
clear
and
persuasive
evidence
that
if
an
exception
is
to
be
applied
that
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
that
limited
exception.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
record
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
very
sparse.
it
refers
only
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
adopted.
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york's
legislative
history
is
equally
sparse.
however,
the
commentators
who
have
examined
the
question
and
some
recent
authorities
on
the
question
have
indicated
that
the
policemen?s
entry
to
execute
a
warrant
or
an
arrest
should
be
analogized
to
the
entry
of
a
burglar
in
the
law
of
burglary.
and
it's
understandable
that
that
analogy
is
drawn
because
in
each
case,
the
societal
interest
involved
are
the
same
namely
to
preserve
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
occupant
and
to
minimize
the
chances
of
violence
which
are
attended
upon
unannounced
intrusions
into
the
home.
interestingly,
only
within
the
last
two
months,
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
rendered
a
decision
which
is
squarely
on
point
with
this
case.
in
interpreting
section
844,
the
california
penal
code,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
section
3109,
the
supreme
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
or
by
chief
justice
trainer
held
that
the
statute
applied
when
a
police
officer
entered
to
a
close
but
unlocked
door
of
a
public
dwelling.
and
it
did
so
on
precisely
the
same
policy
considerations
that
we
are
urging
here
today
and
also
by
analogizing
the
entry
of
the
police
officer
to
the
entry
of
a
burglar
in
the
law
of
burglary.
mr.
murray

pardon
me?
mr.
murray

mr.
murray

think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
murray

i
think
in
that
situation
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
a
case
similar
to
louise
which
this
court
decided
some
years
ago
and
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
when
he
turned
it
into
a
commercial
establishment
for
the
sale
of
narcotics.
mr.
murray

jones
was
allegedly
delivering
narcotics.
mr.
murray

he
was
selling
--

he

--
well
i
know
that's
not
correct
and
he
wasn't

and
he
wasn't
buying.
he
was
a
runner.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
officer
in
the
disguise
of
a
narcotics
peddler
or
a
narcotics
purchaser
had
gained
access
to
the
apartment
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
elicit
narcotics
trade
and
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
as
the
court
said,
of
course.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
he
could
have
done
that,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
at
that
point
--
his
entry
into
the
apartment
was
for
a
very
limited
purpose
which
was
to
engage
in
illegal
drug
activities.
he
did
not
stand
in
the
place
of
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
at
time.
it
was
not
his
place
to
invite
other
people
into
the
apartment.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
justice
marshall
that
was
about
10
minutes
between
five
and
10
minutes
afterwards.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
immediately.
the
arrest
was
made
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question
sir.
the
arrest
was
made
immediately
upon
the
entry
of
the
officers
into
the
apartment.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
they
never
did
make
an
announcement
outside.
the
difference
in
time
was
probably
just
a
question
of
a
few
seconds.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
it
is
your
honor
because
when
they
barged
into
the
apartment,
they
were
in
plain
clothes
as
this
is
usually
the
case
in
narcotics
cases.
the
petitioner
didn't
know

they
were

let
me
just
change
the
facts
for
a
moment
if
i
may

assume
that
mr.
--
the
petitioner
was
standing
in
the
apartment
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
for
some
reason
and
the
police
officers
barged
into
the
apartment
without
announcing
who
they
were,
the
petitioner
at
that
time
even
though
there
may
have
been
only
a
few
seconds
difference
might
have
shot
at
those
individuals
because
he
did

who
they

he
did
not

what
their

but

who
they

the

or
three
seconds
to

or

seconds
to

in.
it
doesn't
always
happen
that
the
narcotics
are
thrown
down
the
drain
and
this
court
itself
has
recognized
that
simply
because
we're
dealing
with
narcotics
cases
there's
no
reason
to
establish
a
special
rule
with
respect
to
the
application
of
section
3109.
mr.

mr.

bring
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
appease
the
court.
i'll
just
take
a
moment
or
two
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
mr.
martin
made.
first,
with
respect
as
to
whether
or
not
this
question
is
right
for
a
decision
by
this
court,
i
think
the
dispositive
answer
to
that
your
honors
is
just
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
met
with
the
same
argument
by
the
government,
and
they
undertook
to
pass
on
the
question
on
its
merits,
and
to
render
a
decision
which
was
contrary
to
the
rulings
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
thereby
presenting
a
clear
conflict
between
circuits
on
this
question.
in
a
similar
situation,
in
jones
versus
united
states,
362
us,
the
court
of
--
this
court
decided
to
decide
a
question
which
had
not
been
properly
been
raised
at
the
trial
court,
in
fact,
involving
the
very
same
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
undertaken
to
decide
the
question
on
the
merits.
i
think
the
same
result
is
required
in
this
case.
but
beyond
that,
the
record,
it
seems
to
me,
it
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
two
contingencies
which
the
government
has
indicated
should
be
further
explored
or
should
have
been
further
explored
at
the
trial,
are
not
really
--
do
not
cast
any
doubt
upon
what
actually
happened
when
the
police
officers
went
in.
there's
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
the
officers
did
not
make
any
announcement
whatsoever.
the
officers
testified
at
great
length
about
the
events
and
circumstances
which
led
up
to
their
entry
into
the
apartment,
and
how
they
entered
the
apartment.
and
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
officer
in
charge
on
page
21
of
the
appendix,
that
no
announcement
was
made.
in
fact,
he
says.
i
knocked
on
the
door,
waited
a
few
seconds,
and
no
answer
came
from
within,
so
i
opened
the
unlocked
door,
and
came
into
the
apartment.
now,
surely,
if
he
had
made
an
announcement
in
describing
how
he
entered
the
apartment,
he
would
have
indicated
that.
in
addition
with
respect
to
the
so-called
exigent
circumstances
that
the
government
realized
upon
the
record,
simply
does
not
show
that
the
police
had
any
reason
whatsoever
to
believe
that
either
jones
or
themselves
were
in
any
peril.
the
record
merely
indicates
that
they
were
frustrated
in
their
efforts
to
make
a
recording,
and
they
decided
to
go
into
the
apartment.
finally
your
honor,
while
i've
had
not
--
not
had
a
chance
to
discuss
the
second
point
in
our
brief,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
it.
i
think
that
this
case
indicates
a
flagrant
disregard
on
the
part
of
the
officers
for
the
warrant
procedure
and
should
not
be
sanctioned
by
the
court.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
important
question
of
statutory
interpretation
with
respect
to
a
constitutionally
inspired
federal
statue
that
governs
the
conduct
of
federal
officers
when
they
made
or
are
required
to
break
in
to
a
private
dwelling
in
order
to
affect
another
wise
lawful
arrest.
also
involved
in
the
case
is
a
question
whether
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
federal
officers
may
force
their
way
into
a
private
dwelling
at
night
in
order
to
make
an
arrest
with
other
warrant
under
circumstances
which
did
not
excuse
their
failure
to
obtain
the
warrant.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
complicated
and
maybe
briefly
summarized
as
follows;
on
saturday
evening
february
19th,
1966,
a
man
by
the
name
of
edward
jones
was
entering
the
united
states
from
mexico
at
the
san
ysidro,
california
port
of
entry.
he
was
stopped
by
custom
officials
and
was
searched,
whereupon
the
customs
officials
discovered
a
container
of
cocaine
concealed
in
his
undershorts.
they
immediately
arrested
him
for
violations
of
the
narcotics
laws.
and
thereupon,
they
began
a
process
of
interrogation.
initially,
mr.
jones
denied
that
he
was
involved
in
this
elicit
transaction
with
anyone
else
but
after
about
three
or
four
hours
of
interrogation,
he
admitted
to
the
customs
officers
that
he
had
actually
been
taken
to
mexico
on
the
preceding
day
by
a
person
named
johnny,
that
johnny
had
hired
him
to
pick
up
the
narcotics
and
bring
them
back
to
los
angeles
for
delivery
to
johnny
and
that
johnny
had
promised
to
pay
him
$100
if
he
did
so.
at
that
point,
the
customs
officials
transported
jones
from
san
diego
to
los
angeles
and
at
approximately
at
3
o?clock
in
the
morning,
jones
in
the
presence
of
the
customs
officers
try
to
telephone
a
number
in
los
angeles
which
was
written
on
a
card
that
the
police
officers
found
in
jones?s
possession
when
he
was
arrested,
also
on
a
card
was
the
named
johnny.
no
one
answered
that
telephone
call
and
three
or
four
other
attempts
were
made
to
call
that
number
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
sunday,
february
20th
and
again
no
answer
was
obtained.
the
officers
then
for
some
reason
which
is
undisclosed
by
the
record
transported
jones
back
to
san
diego.
at
3:00
pm
on
the
following
afternoon,
the
officers
again
invited
jones
to
try
and
call
the
number
in
los
angeles.
on
this
occasion,
the
call
was
answered
by
a
male
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
jones
identified
himself
as
bj
and
addressed
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
telephone
as
johnny.
he
indicated
that
he
was
still
in
san
diego
and
that
he
still
had
the
thing.
johnny
then
inquired
whether
jones
had
any
trouble
in
crossing
the
line.
jones
indicated
that
he
had
not
and
johnny
said
that
he
had
been
arrested
when
he
had
been
down
in
mexico
and
that
was
the
reason
he
was
curious
as
to
whether
or
not
jones
had
had
any
trouble.
jones
inquired
whether
johnny
was
going
to
be
in
hes
apartment
and
when
johnny
said
he
would,
jones
said
well
i'll
come
up
to
los
angeles
to
your
apartment.
at
that
point,
the
agents
did
not
attempt
to
verify
any
further
any
of
the
information
which
had
been
given
to
them
by
jones
who
dwell
all
intents
and
purposes
was
an
unreliable
informant
nor
did
they
go
to
a
magistrate
in
an
effort
to
try
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
johnny's
arrest.
rather
they
transported
jones
to
los
angeles.
they
went
to
the
location
where
johnny's
apartment
was.
they
outfitted
jones
with
an
electronic
transmitting
device
and
they
returned
the
container
of
cocaine
to
jones
and
sent
him
to
johnny?s
apartment.
at
this
time
the
officers
of
which
there
were
four
or
five
in
number
took
up
positions
near
the
apartment.
and
they
attempted
to
overhear
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
jones
and
people
inside
of
the
apartment.
jones
went
to
the
apartment,
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
door
was
answered
by
a
woman
who
was
visiting
johnny
at
that
time.
jones
asked
if
johnny
was
in
and
the
lady
said
that
he
was
and
that
she
would
get
him.
jones
then
went
into
the
apartment
and
the
lady
closed
the
door
to
the
apartment.
now,
this
much
of
the
conversation
was
overheard
by
the
officers
who
were
listening
to
the
electronic
transmitting
device.
when
jones
went
into
the
apartment,
the
lady
who
was
there
called
johnny
who
turned
out
to
be
petitioner,
from
the
bedroom
and
he
came
in
to
the
living
room
and
met
with
jones.
the
conversation
that
followed
was
not
overheard
by
the
police
officers
because
there
was
music
being
played
in
the
background
and
this
drowned
out
their
ability
to
hear
the
conversation
over
the
electronic
transmitting
device.
apparently,
the
officers
in
los
angeles
did
not
have
available
to
them
some
of
the
more
sophisticated
means
of
bugging
that
this
court
has
just
heard
about
and
they
therefore
were
frustrated
in
their
efforts
to
hear
what
went
on
in
the
apartment
and
to
make
the
recording
of
that
conversation.
one
of
the
officers
did
testify
that
he
heard
one
of
the
people
in
the
apartment
mentioned
the
word
?package?
though
he
could
not
identify
which
of
the
two
people
mentioned
that
word.
and
the
other
person
made
a
response,
though
he
also
could
not
identify
or
make
out
what
the
response
was.
at
this
point
after
jones
had
been
in
the
apartment
for
approximately
five
to
ten
minutes,
the
officers
decided
that
because
they
could
not
make
a
recording
of
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
within
the
apartment
that
they
should
then
proceed
into
the
apartment
to
make
the
arrest.
three
or
four
officers
approached
the
door
of
the
apartment.
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
group
knocked
on
the
door,
waited
a
few
seconds,
when
there
was
no
reply,
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door,
the
door
being
unlocked
he
opened
it
and
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
his
gun
drawn.
he
was
immediately
followed
by
two
or
three
other
officers
at
least
one
of
who,
also
had
his
gun
drawn.
there
was
no
announcement
by
the
police
at
least
the
record
discloses
that
their
was
no
announcement
by
the
police
that
any
of
the
officers
announced
who
they
were,
what
their
purpose
was
or
what
their
authority
was
before
entering
the
apartment.
once
inside
of
the
apartment,
the
officers
observed
petitioners
sitting
on
the
couch,
dressed
only
in
his
underclothes
and
jones
sitting
on
a
chair
next
to
the
couch.
as
they
entered
one
of
the
officers
indicated
that
he
saw
a
petitioner
withdraw
his
hand
from
underneath
the
cushion
of
the
couch.
they
immediately
announced
that
both
petitioner
and
jones
were
under
arrest.
they
took
petitioner
from
the
couch,
placed
him
against
the
wall,
put
him
in
handcuffs,
searched
him,
searched
jones
and
then
undertook
a
general
and
comprehensive
search
of
the
entire
apartment.
in
the
course
of
that
search,
they
found
the
container
of
narcotics
and
under
the
cushion
of
the
couch
near
where
the
petitioner
had
been
sitting.
they
also
found
in
other
rooms
of
the
apartment
certain
evidence
which
was
not
introduced
at
petitioners
trial
but
which
was
testified
about
specifically
some
squares,
aluminum
squares
and
some
balloons
which
the
police
officer
indicated
were
customarily
used
in
the
elicit
trade
of
narcotics.
the
officers
then
placed
both
petitioner
and
jones
under
arrest
and
took
them
from
the
apartment.
mr.
jones
did
not
have
on
his
person
the
$100.00
which
he
claimed
petitioner
had
promised
to
give
him
if
he
had
delivered
the
narcotics.
at
the
trial,
when
the
government
attempted
to
introduce
the
container
of
narcotics,
the
petitioners
counsel
objected
in
a
rather
general
fashion.
he
indicated
that
principally
the
police
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
enter
the
apartment
when
they
did
to
make
the
arrest.
he
also
objected
to
the
fact
that
the
police
entered
the
apartment
without
a
warrant
and
his
discussion
or
his
general
lodging
of
the
objection
also
contained
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
police
broke
into
the
apartment.
the
district
court
denied
the
objection,
had
admitted
the
narcotics
into
evidence
and
an
appeal
from
his
conviction.
the
conviction
was
affirmed,
the
court
of
appeals
sustaining
the
district
court's
admission
of
the
narcotics
into
evidence.
now,
the
petitioner
today
principally
contends
that
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
was
unlawful
and
that
the
search
which
was
conducted
subsequent
to
that
arrest
was
also
unlawful
thereby
requiring
that
the
narcotics
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
trial.
the
basic
reason
for
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
is
the
fact
that
the
officers
when
they
broke
in
to
petitioner's
apartment
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
18
usc
section
3109
which
indicates
that
an
officer
may
break
in
to
an
apartment
to
effect
an
arrest
but
only
if
he
first
announces
his
authority
and
his
purpose
for
breaking
in.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct
by
its
term
the
statue
would
not
seem
to
contemplate
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
on
the
other
hand,
that
specific
question
was
raised
in
united
states
against
miller
where
the
government
conceded
that
the
statute
does
apply
to
any
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
it
does
apply
to
that
kind
of
arrest.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
so
that
you
might
say
that
the
statue
has
been
extended
beyond
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
now
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
below,
both
take
the
position
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
there
was
not
a
breaking
open
of
the
apartment.
and
the
theory
upon
which
their
argument
rests
is
best
summarized
at
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
where
it
takes
the
position
that
in
common
understanding,
break
open
connotes
the
forcible
destruction
of
a
locked
door.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
government's
position
and
it
was
not
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
the
word
break
open
means
only
the
use
of
force
to
gain
access
to
a
private
dwelling
and
that
unless
force
is
used,
the
announcement
requirement
of
section
3109
is
not
applicable.
your
honors,
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
hyper-technical
and
detached
overly-strained
interpretation
of
the
words
break
open
and
it's
not
consistent
at
all
with
the
basic
objectives
which
the
announcement
requirement
of
section
3109
were
intended
to
serve.
mr.
or
judge
learned
hand
has
indicated
in
one
of
his
famous
decisions
that
the
art
of
interpretation
is
the
art
of
proliferating
a
purpose.
and
we
think
that
if
one
analyzes
what
the
purpose
of
section
3109
is,
what
the
purpose
of
the
announcement
requirement
is,
it
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
as
the
government
suggests
to
draw
a
distinction
between
forcibly
breaking
into
an
apartment
and
walking
through
a
closed
but
unlocked
door.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
interesting
a
lot
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
the
ninth
circuit
itself
has
so
held
that
if
a
police
officer
gains
access
by
using
a
passkey
to
open
the
door
that
somehow
that
is
brought
within
the
purview
of
section
3109
even
though
the
government
admits
there's
no
force
involved
there.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice.
there
it
seems
to
me
to
be
no
difference
if
forces
to
be
at
all
relevant
in
the
application
of
the
statutes,
whether
the
door
knob
is
turned
by
the
force
of
the
energy
of
the
hand
turning
the
knob
or
whether
it
passkey
is
use.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well
that
presents
a
more
difficult
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
not
in
terms
of
purpose,
no.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
would
make
the
same
argument
to
this
extent
that
the
objectives
of
the
statue
are
designed
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
occupant
of
the
home
and
to
prevent
violence
which
frequently
accompanies
unannounced
intrusions
into
the
home.
and
also
to
ensure
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
every
citizen
enjoys.
now,
one
of
the
door
is
open
or
closed
or
partially
secured
by
arrested
chain
or
whatever
the
situation
maybe,
those
objectives
it
seems
to
me
have
to
be
served
in
every
case
unless
there
are
some
indication
that
the
person
in
the
apartment
has
voluntarily
relinquished
his
privacy
or
has
invited
the
police
to
come
into
the
apartment.
now,
i
think
as
is
the
case
in
most
search
and
seizure
cases,
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
in
every
situation.
but
i
can
easily
conceive
of
the
case
in
which
the
door
would
be
open
in
which
the
statutory
requirement
should
apply.
for
example,
a
person
may
have
come
into
his
apartment
and
shut
the
door
closed
thinking
that
he
closed
it
but
in
fact
the
latch
didn?t
catch
and
a
gust
of
wind
may
have
come
along
and
opened
the
door
again.
the
person
then
goes
into
another
room
of
the
apartment
maybe
watching
television,
maybe
eating
dinner,
the
police
come,
they
see
the
door
open
and
they
walked
into
the
apartment.
now,
as
far
as
the
person
inside
the
apartment
is
concerned,
he
doesn't
know
who
those
people
are,
he
doesn't
know
why
they're
there.
he
has
not
invited
them
into
his
apartment.
they
have
invaded
his
privacy,
they
have
--
as
far
as
he
knows,
they
maybe
burglars,
they
may
burglars.
and
they
may
elicit
the
same
violent
response
that
any
unannounced
intrusion
into
the
home
may
elicit.
so
there,
the
situation
in
my
opinion
where
the
fact
that
the
door
open
does
not
eliminate
the
necessity
from
making
the
announcement
require
--
the
necessity
from
making
the
announcement.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
to
would
required
you
to
do
that
because
it
applies
both
to
outer
and
inner
doors
of
the
apartment.
again,
i
can
consider
situations
where
the
person
maybe
asleep
in
a
bedroom
and
the
door
to
which
it's
closed.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
hear
the
knock
of
the
outer
door
and
the
police
then
go
in
should
not
relieve
the
police,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
obligation
of
exercising
reasonable
caution
not
to
surprise
and
alarm
the
person
who
maybe
sleeping
in
the
bedroom.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
miller,
does
not
have
unreasonable
burden
of
the
statute
imposes
upon
the
police.
all
they
have
to
do
is
announce
who
they
are
and
why
they
are
there
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
yes,
i
think
there
are
some
exceptions.
at
least
i
can
conceive
the
situations
in
this
court
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
don't
--
well,
the
government
makes
the
argument
mr.
justice
white
that
there
were
so
called
exigent
circumstances
here
which
excuse
the
police
from
making
the
announcement.
it's
an
open
question
as
far
as
i
know
as
to
whether
this
statute
permits
exigent
circumstances
to
provide
an
exception
to
the
requirement.
in
miller,
the
court
held
that
that
was
open
question.
however,
in
ker
against
california,
when
a
similar
state
statute
was
being
considered
and
when
the
question
was
a
constitutional
requirement
imposed
upon
state
officers,
the
court
did
find
that
the
constitution
permitted
an
exception
for
certain
exigent
circumstances.
now,
the
only
one
that
the
government
alludes
to
in
this
case
is
the
possibility
that
the
police
were
concerned
over
the
safety
of
mr.
jones
who
was
in
the
apartment
and
whose
conversation
they
could
not
hear
about
and
also
to
the
possible
safety
of
themselves
in
going
into
an
apartment
but
first
having
to
announce
their
purpose
and
authority.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
can
conceive
of
the
situation
like
that
where
there
would
be
exigent
circumstances.
for
example,
they
knew
that
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
was
heavily
armed
and
had
a
prior
record
of
use
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
excuse
the
announcement.
in
my
own
opinion
though,
as
i
indicate
the
court
itself
has
never
gone
that
far
in
interpreting
the
requirements.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
i
wish
that
the
effort
would
be
made
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
facts.
the
record
discloses
no
facts
to
indicate
that
the
police
had
any
reasons
or
whatsoever
to
believe
that
jones
was
in
danger
or
that
they
themselves
would
have
been
in
danger.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
the
exception
of
the
kidnapper.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
court
did
so
in
ker
versus
california
while
it's
true
they
were
not
interpreting
this
specific
statue.
the
policy
reasons
which
they
articulated
in
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
that
case
indicate
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
it
would
be
unreasonable
or
unnecessary
for
the
police
to
make
the
announcement.
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
indicated
that
because
the
police
had
reasons
to
believe
that
the
announcement
would
have
facilitated
the
destruction
of
evidence
in
view
of
the
defendant's
prior
part
of
conduct
that
the
police
were
not
required
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
there's
no
doubt
your
honor
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
go
as
far
in
permitting
exceptions
to
the
statue
as
were
permitted
in
the
current
case
when
the
similar
requirement
was
then
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
certainly
have
no
objection
to
the
court
coming
out
with
a
broad
principle
in
this
case
which
and
i
think
in
fact
that
i
think
it
should
come
out
with
as
broad
as
principle
as
possible
which
would
require
the
police
to
make
the
announcement
in
every
case.
now,
it's
not
difficult
to
conceive
of
hundreds
of
different
types
of
factual
situations
where
making
the
announcement
might
be
imprudent
or
might
lead
to
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
might
lead
to
placing
somebody
in
physical
peril,
that
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
general
principle
ought
to
be
that
the
rule
of
announcement
should
be
imposed
and
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
government
to
establish
through
very
clear
and
persuasive
evidence
that
if
an
exception
is
to
be
applied
that
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
that
limited
exception.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
record
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
very
sparse.
it
refers
only
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
adopted.
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york's
legislative
history
is
equally
sparse.
however,
the
commentators
who
have
examined
the
question
and
some
recent
authorities
on
the
question
have
indicated
that
the
policemen?s
entry
to
execute
a
warrant
or
an
arrest
should
be
analogized
to
the
entry
of
a
burglar
in
the
law
of
burglary.
and
it's
understandable
that
that
analogy
is
drawn
because
in
each
case,
the
societal
interest
involved
are
the
same
namely
to
preserve
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
occupant
and
to
minimize
the
chances
of
violence
which
are
attended
upon
unannounced
intrusions
into
the
home.
interestingly,
only
within
the
last
two
months,
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
rendered
a
decision
which
is
squarely
on
point
with
this
case.
in
interpreting
section
844,
the
california
penal
code,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
section
3109,
the
supreme
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
or
by
chief
justice
trainer
held
that
the
statute
applied
when
a
police
officer
entered
to
a
close
but
unlocked
door
of
a
public
dwelling.
and
it
did
so
on
precisely
the
same
policy
considerations
that
we
are
urging
here
today
and
also
by
analogizing
the
entry
of
the
police
officer
to
the
entry
of
a
burglar
in
the
law
of
burglary.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
pardon
me?
mr.
murray
h.
bring
you
mean
in
disguise?
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
no
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
right.
i
think
in
that
situation
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
a
case
similar
to
louise
which
this
court
decided
some
years
ago
and
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
when
he
turned
it
into
a
commercial
establishment
for
the
sale
of
narcotics.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
jones
was
allegedly
delivering
narcotics.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
he
was
selling
--
well
he
was
--
well
i
know
that's
not
correct
and
he
wasn't
selling
and
he
wasn't
buying.
he
was
a
runner.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
officer
in
the
disguise
of
a
narcotics
peddler
or
a
narcotics
purchaser
had
gained
access
to
the
apartment
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
elicit
narcotics
trade
and
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
as
the
court
said,
of
course.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
he
could
have
done
that,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
at
that
point
--
his
entry
into
the
apartment
was
for
a
very
limited
purpose
which
was
to
engage
in
illegal
drug
activities.
he
did
not
stand
in
the
place
of
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
at
time.
it
was
not
his
place
to
invite
other
people
into
the
apartment.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
justice
marshall
that
was
about
10
minutes
between
five
and
10
minutes
afterwards.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
immediately.
the
arrest
was
made
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question
sir.
the
arrest
was
made
immediately
upon
the
entry
of
the
officers
into
the
apartment.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well,
they
never
did
make
an
announcement
outside.
the
difference
in
time
was
probably
just
a
question
of
a
few
seconds.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
think
it
is
your
honor
because
when
they
barged
into
the
apartment,
they
were
in
plain
clothes
as
this
is
usually
the
case
in
narcotics
cases.
the
petitioner
didn't
know
if
they
were
police
when
they
came
in
with
their
cons
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
pardon
me?
mr.
murray
h.
bring
within
a
matter
of
seconds
after
their
entry.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
that's
right.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
they
had
announced
too
they
were
and
who
their
purpose
was.
but
let
me
just
change
the
facts
for
a
moment
if
i
may
your
honor.
assume
that
mr.
--
the
petitioner
was
standing
in
the
apartment
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
for
some
reason
and
the
police
officers
barged
into
the
apartment
without
announcing
who
they
were,
the
petitioner
at
that
time
even
though
there
may
have
been
only
a
few
seconds
difference
might
have
shot
at
those
individuals
because
he
did
not
know
who
they
were.
he
did
not
know
what
their
purpose
was.
but
if
they
had
been
police
officers
and
announced
who
they
were
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
part
of
it
is
to
protect
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
but
part
of
his
is
also
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
yes,
well
i
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
well
--
mr.
murray
h.
bring
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow
your
honor.
it
would've
taken
the
police
two
or
three
seconds
to
announce
as
it
did
took
him
two
or
three
seconds
to
come
in.
it
doesn't
always
happen
that
the
narcotics
are
thrown
down
the
drain
and
this
court
itself
has
recognized
that
simply
because
we're
dealing
with
narcotics
cases
there's
no
reason
to
establish
a
special
rule
with
respect
to
the
application
of
section
3109.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
jones
was
in
any
danger
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
i
believe
it
applies
to
all
federal
officers
your
honor.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
to
make
arrest.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
that's
correct.
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time?
mr.
murray
h.
bring
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
appease
the
court.
i'll
just
take
a
moment
or
two
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
mr.
martin
made.
first,
with
respect
as
to
whether
or
not
this
question
is
right
for
a
decision
by
this
court,
i
think
the
dispositive
answer
to
that
your
honors
is
just
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
met
with
the
same
argument
by
the
government,
and
they
undertook
to
pass
on
the
question
on
its
merits,
and
to
render
a
decision
which
was
contrary
to
the
rulings
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
thereby
presenting
a
clear
conflict
between
circuits
on
this
question.
in
a
similar
situation,
in
jones
versus
united
states,
362
us,
the
court
of
--
this
court
decided
to
decide
a
question
which
had
not
been
properly
been
raised
at
the
trial
court,
in
fact,
involving
the
very
same
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
undertaken
to
decide
the
question
on
the
merits.
i
think
the
same
result
is
required
in
this
case.
but
beyond
that,
the
record,
it
seems
to
me,
it
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
two
contingencies
which
the
government
has
indicated
should
be
further
explored
or
should
have
been
further
explored
at
the
trial,
are
not
really
--
do
not
cast
any
doubt
upon
what
actually
happened
when
the
police
officers
went
in.
there's
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
the
officers
did
not
make
any
announcement
whatsoever.
the
officers
testified
at
great
length
about
the
events
and
circumstances
which
led
up
to
their
entry
into
the
apartment,
and
how
they
entered
the
apartment.
and
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
officer
in
charge
on
page
21
of
the
appendix,
that
no
announcement
was
made.
in
fact,
he
says.
i
knocked
on
the
door,
waited
a
few
seconds,
and
no
answer
came
from
within,
so
i
opened
the
unlocked
door,
and
came
into
the
apartment.
now,
surely,
if
he
had
made
an
announcement
in
describing
how
he
entered
the
apartment,
he
would
have
indicated
that.
in
addition
with
respect
to
the
so-called
exigent
circumstances
that
the
government
realized
upon
the
record,
simply
does
not
show
that
the
police
had
any
reason
whatsoever
to
believe
that
either
jones
or
themselves
were
in
any
peril.
the
record
merely
indicates
that
they
were
frustrated
in
their
efforts
to
make
a
recording,
and
they
decided
to
go
into
the
apartment.
finally
your
honor,
while
i've
had
not
--
not
had
a
chance
to
discuss
the
second
point
in
our
brief,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
it.
i
think
that
this
case
indicates
a
flagrant
disregard
on
the
part
of
the
officers
for
the
warrant
procedure
and
should
not
be
sanctioned
by
the
court.
thank
you,
your
honors.
