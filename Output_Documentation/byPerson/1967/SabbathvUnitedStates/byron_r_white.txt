white
and
well
as
soon
as
he

then
sold
some
narcotics,
he
arrested
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
too
long
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they're
selling
narcotic.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
he
was
buying
instead
of
--
they
thought
he
was
buying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
jones
--
if
jones
had
been
a
police

he
could've
--
under
louise,
he
could've
arrested
him

did
you
ask
the

to
remand
it
so
you
can
make
the
piece
of
the
factual
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
notice
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the

objects
for
considering
this
that
we
don't
think
it
should
be
technical
or
something
like
that.
justice

white
but
you've
said
mr.
martin
you
do
not
know
whether
this
question
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
byron

white
now,
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
reach
out
to
cite
a
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
petitioner
is

white
he
raised
it

come
back
and
say
that
the
court
of
appeals,
it
should
not
be
considered
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
met
the
appellant
on
the
merits
of
that
question,
on
the
record
whatever
the
record
is,
isn't
that
a
difficult
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
reverse
the
case,
they
reversed
the
court
of

on
just
on
this
record
that
doesn?t
propose
the
possibilities
that
there
are
more
fact
that
have
been
put
in
this
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
this

weren't
they?
justice
byron

had
been
any
