how
soon
have
he
got
in
when
the
arrest
made?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
going
on
all
that
time?
let
me
put
the
question
definitely,
how
soon
after
they
went
in
the
door
did
the
occupant
see
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
was
the
difference
between
them
announcing
outside
and
announcing
inside
in
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
material?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
soon
did
he
knew
they
were
police
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
they've
got
a
few
seconds
either
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
same
thing
would
have
been
accomplished
if
(inaudible)
they
read
the
statute
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
to
call
on
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
officer
doesn't
need
that
protection
it's
just
too
bad
for
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
not
involved
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
involved
here
is
if
he
had
announced
outside,
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
because
in
narcotics
it
would
have
been
there
under
drain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
jones
could
have
been
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
martin,
would
you
tell
me
the
difference
between
the
turning
of
the
key,
passkey
and
the
turning
of
the
knob
that
makes
one
to
break
it
and
the
other
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
real
difference
that
when
he
locks
his
door
he
doesn't
expect
somebody
to
either
break
it
or
use
a
passkey?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
expressed
it
might
open.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
say
that
in
a
home
where
there
are
a
number
of
children,
and
the
doors
were
left
open
or
left
unlocked
so
that
the
children
could
run
in
and
run
out
anytime
of
the
day,
that
they
wanted
to
come
in
the
house
for
one
reason
or
another,
that
that
home
was
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
taking
the
risk
against
what,
lawlessness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
to
say
that
the
failure
to
lock
your
door
is
an
invitation
to
anyone
to
come
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
draw
it
according
to
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
cases
supporting
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
argument
is
supporting
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
mr.
bring
to
say
that
the
word
break.
in
this
statute
and
statutes
like
it
had
been
construed
in
other
statutes
as
equated
to
the
word
break
in
the
burglary
statutes.
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suggested,
or
decided?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
have
to
say
that
in
narcotic
cases
all
the
police
have
to
do
is
to
send
in
an
undercover
man
into
the
--
into
some
quarters
and
wait
a
few
minutes,
and
then
break
open,
break
down
the
door
and
go
in
and
arrest
him,
on
that
same
theory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
don't,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
ordinary
case
and
this
case.
justice
thurgood

mr.
