justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bring,
section
3109
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
what
an
officer
may
do
to
execute
a
search
warrant
and
here
this
was
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
just
for
two
reasons,
180
degrees
different
from
what
the
statute
seems
to
be
addressed
to.
but
i
gathered
from
reading
the
briefs
that
both
counsel
agreed
that
this
is
the
applicable
statue,
am
i
right
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
force
of
you
to
turning
the
key
is
like
the
force
in
turning
the
door
knob
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
statute
apply
--
if
you
announce
your
purpose
at
the
outside
and
you're
not
--
and
there's
no
answer,
you're
not
--
your
purpose
or
--
and
then
you
try
the
door
and
it
opens
and
you
go
in
there's
three
rooms
in
the
apartment.
the
doors
are
shut
in
both
of
the
rooms,
you
have
to
do
the
same
things
to
those
doors
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
police
knew
that
there
was
a
kidnap
victim
being
held
in
that
apartment
and
reliably
have
been
told
by
other
residents
in
that
building,
do
you
think
they
-
-those
would
be
exigent
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
heard
some
shooting
in
the
apartment
when
jones
was
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
statute
that
the
government
rely
on
with
which
they
based
their
theory
for
jones
for
safety?
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
you
find
it
out
from
them?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
jones
doing
with
this
fellow?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
jones
then
--
that
the
jones
could
have
arrested
him
could
he
have
before
he
arrested
him
with
the
door
and
opened
it
and
said
come
on
in
to
the
other
police
officers
outside?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bring
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
3109
apply
to
all
federal
officers
or
just
to
some?
justice
potter
stewart
all
federal
officers
who
are
authorized
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
make
arrest
or
to
execute
a
search
warrant,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
actually.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
martin
the
petitioner
was
decided
in
what
court?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
my
question
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
it
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
white
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
that
just
like
--
if
the
petitioner,
if
the
police
had
announced
their
presence
and
the
fellow
had
said
--
petitioner
had
said,
get
away
from
here,
or
i'll
kill
jones,
they
could
have
broken
in.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
mr.
martin,
first
of
all
these
is
an
exigent
circumstance's
exception.
do
you
read
that
in
the
statute
that
it
hasn't
yet
been
decided
here,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
conclusion
of
the
congress.
