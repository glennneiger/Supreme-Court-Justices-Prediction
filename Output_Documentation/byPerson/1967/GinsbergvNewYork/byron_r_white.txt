(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
where
is
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
gather
that
under
this
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
nudity
alone
doesn't
--
isn't
--
is
not
proscribed.
i
gather
that
its
only
nudity
which
is
harmful
to
minors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
nudity
which
is
harmful
to
minors
has
to
be
patently
offensive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
prevailing
standards
in
the
adult
community
as
a
whole
with
respect
to
what
is
suitable
material
for
minors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
really
without
redeeming
social
importance
for
minors.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
though
the
--
any
picture
--
any
nude
picture
in
a
magazine
would
be
bad
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
really
--
i
really,
it's
a
--
i
wonder
if
a
statute
wouldn't
reach
all
nude
--
any
kind
of
a
nude
in
that
magazine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you.
what
about
the
nudist
magazines?
which
you've
been
held
not
obscene
for
adults,
how
do
you
think
they
would
fair
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
before
you
go
on
this
--
under
the
new
york
practice
and
under
a
suspended
sentence
may
the
defendant
be
called
back
into
court
and
sentenced
later
is
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
he
doesn't
impose
the
sentence
and
then
suspended
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
suspend
any
sentencing,
the
case
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
such
a
thing
then
as
a
final
judgment
suspending
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
and
that's
what
we
have
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
a
different
proposition
i
suppose
if
this
suspended
--
if
these
sentences
could
be
imposed.
but
if
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gathered
from
the
state's
presentation
that
once
that
sentence
was
suspended,
that
was
the
end
of
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that
--
that
no
sentence
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
sentence
could
be
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
there
they've
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
been
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
could
fine
in
tannenbaum.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
different
if
a
judge
uses
it
in
connection
with
sentences,
with
sentencing.
that
may
be
different
from
the
law
requiring
a
higher
sentence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
of
the
prior
convictions.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
