well,
let

get
this,
this
is

isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
court's
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
he
finds
that
people
who
are
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
he
was
16,
defendant
who
had
reason
to
know
that
it
was
that,
and
that
people's
exhibit
two,
three,
four
and
five,
now
those
are
the
four
magazines,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
contained
pictures
and
photographs
depicting
female
nudities
as
to
find
by
the
courts
as
sexual?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
has
last
further.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
people's
exhibit
five
and
people's
exhibit
three
contained
a
verbal
descriptions
and
narrative
accounts
of
sexual
excitement
and
sexual
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
what
you
say
is
beyond
the
charge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that's
the
cole-arkansas
point,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that's
what
you
want?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
you
can
win
by

on
the
cole-arkansas

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
do
that
mr.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
argued
--
the
last
time
you
were
here,
you
tried
that
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
challenge
that
practice?
justice

that
was

here
not

justice
william
j.

of
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
cole
and
arkansas
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
that
he
was
convicted
on
something
which
he
wasn't

justice
william
j.

well,
that's
important,
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
that
were
so,
this
couldn't
stand
i
take
it,
could
it?

justice
william
j.
brennan,

page

what
language
charges
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

to
minors?
and
now,
that
incorporates
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
written
as
well
as
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
cahn,
that
being
the
--
those
being
terms
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
just
looked
at
these
magazines.
i
think
you'd
agree
limiting
this
now
to
the
pictures
for
the
moment
that
magazines
precisely
like
this
in
the
context
of
obscenity
determinations
of
distribution
to
adults
have
been
held
by
this
court
in
number
of
cases
now
to
be
not
obscene.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
got
to
say
that
although
in
their
distribution
to
adults
they
are
not
obscene.
nevertheless,
we
should
fashion
a
principle
that
in
their
distribution
to
children
under
17
they
are
obscene,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
mr.
cahn,
i
don't
know
why
you
say
that
any
picture
in
light
of
two
ways
instantly
this
is
--
this
prosecutions
under
the
65
statute
of
course
not
under
the
amended
67
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they
--
as
i
read
at
page
29
i'm
looking
at
mr.
redfield's
brief.
the
statute,
unlawful
for
any
person
knowingly
to
sell
or
loan
for
monetary
consideration
of
a
minor
any
picture;
skip
the
rest
of
it;
or
any
photograph
which
depicts
nudity
and
which
is
harmful
to
minors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
it
has
to
have
all
of
the
roth
elements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
single
picture,
it
would
seem
to
me
looking
at
a,
that
satisfied
that
description
and
this
magazine
even
if
none
of
the
others
did
would
support
a
prosecution
under
a,
wouldn't
it?
as
for
a
single
picture
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right,
if
it
was
harmful
to
minors
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
so
that
the
(inaudible)
taken
as
a
whole
is
meaningless,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
this
gets
me,
that's
why
i'm
trouble
by
the
cole
and
arkansas
point.
i
must
say
i
have
difficulty
reading
count
two
as
drawing
in
what
apparently
the
trial
judge
relied
on,
namely
the
written
materials.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
what
he
did
is
merely
surpluses
that
on
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
is
he
does
--
a
year
or
so
ago,
we've
dismissed
a
couple
of
case
is
here
wherein
a
new
york
prosecution
where
the
man
had
been
fined
but
he
had
paid
his
fine.
we
dismissed
the
case
as
moot.
wouldn't
this
be
moved
a
fortiori
under
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
that
doesn't
require
us
to
give
it
as
the
case
is
moot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
they
were.
they
were
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
obscenity
convictions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
obscenity
convictions
and
a
fine
had
been
paid
and
we
dismissed
the
cases
as
moot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
answer
whether
or
not
those
other
cases
are
not

dismissing
this
is
moot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

they
were
only
fine
in
those
cases.

why?

if
