mr.
william
cahn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
cahn
which
is
that
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
don't
believe
that's
quite
sir
correct
because
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
(inaudible)
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
would
agree
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
information
specifically
charges
in
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
in
the
second
count.
mr.
william
cahn
the
language
here
suggests
harmful
to
minor
in
the
--
and
which
taken
as
a
whole
is
harmful
to
minors.
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
written
as
well
as
the
pictorial
part
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
because
the
entire
statute
gives
reference
mr.
justice
brennan
in
its
description
of
what
is
the
obscene.
mr.
william
cahn
the
charge
mentions
in
the
second
count.
the
defendant
did
violate
the
provisions
of
the
said
section
484-h
subdivision
2(b)
of
the
penal
law
and
that
the
defendant
knowingly
--
did
knowingly
sell
to
a
minor
a
magazine
which
and
taken
as
a
whole
is
harmful
to
minors
and
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
applies
to
the
written
as
well
as
to
the
pictorial
part
of
the
magazine.
i
believe
that
the
major
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
a
state
may
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
enact
the
law
founded
upon
the
variable
obscenity
concept
prohibiting
the
commercial
distribution
to
children
under
17
years
of
age
of
materials
obscene
as
to
such
children
although
not
necessarily
obscene
as
to
adults.
and
whether
the
statute
in
question
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
valid
children's
obscenity
law
whether
its
phraseology
is
sufficiently
definite.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
this
is
a
matter
for
the
legislature
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon?
mr.
william
cahn
well,
the
legislature
found
it
in
its
wisdom
that
the
obscenity
statute
in
reference
to
484-h
should
apply
to
those
under
17
and
perhaps
for
different
reasons
in
the
state
of
texas
found
that
it
should
apply
to
those
under
16
for
the
reason
that
--
the
states
have
considerate
21
to
be
the
age
for
qualified
voting
rather
than
15,
16,
17
or
18.
i
have
no
definite
reason
to
give
you
as
to
why
the
state
legislature
saw
fit
to
limit
its
exercise
over
children
to
the
age
of
17
rather
than
16
or
to
18
or
to
19
or
to
any
other
age
for
that
matter.
and
if
i
may
continue,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statute's
phraseology
is
sufficiently
definite
to
satisfy
the
minimum
requirements
of
due
process
as
they
relate
to
obscenity
and
whether
its
scienter
clause
is
objectionable
or
exerting
an
undue
restraint
on
commercial
distribution
to
adults
of
materials
within
the
prohibition
of
484-h.
484-h,
a
violation
of
which
was
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
is
a
children's
obscenity
law
validly
based
on
the
variable
obscenity
concept
approved
by
this
court
in
mishkin
against
new
york.
it
was
characterized
as
a
children's
obscenity
law
by
new
york's
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
bookcase
incorporated
against
broderick
case
and
this
court
of
course
held
in
mishkin
that
it
will
accept
such
a
characterization.
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
characterization
is
correct
since
the
statute's
definition
of
harmful
to
minors
includes
the
elements
of
this
court's
definition
of
obscenity
that
is
predominant,
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
patent,
offensiveness
and
absence
of
social
importance
with
slight
adjustments
of
wording
necessary
to
relate
and
confined
its
prohibiting
reach
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
cahn
even
though
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
obscene
as
to
adults
and
adults
in
this
particular
statute
are
not
bound
by
the
rigid
concepts
established
by
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
the
broderick
case
rightly
it
is
submitted
that
children
were
a
recipient
group
within
the
mishkin
doctrine
because
they
are
the
group
to
whom
the
objectionable
material
is
directed
or
from
whom
it's
quarantined.
the
court
may
judicially
notice
i
submit
that
these
materials
including
girly
magazines
are
directed
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
because
experience
is
thought
as
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
teenager
is
the
greatest
market
for
these
girly
magazines.
mr.
william
cahn
it
is
submitted
and
suggested
by
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
there
is
none
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
because
of
my
own
experience
your
honor
i
have
found
that
--
mr.
william
cahn
time
has
changed
since
then
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
cahn
the
magazines
which
we
refer,
the
magazines
in
question
are
written
and
insofar
as
my
own
personal
opinion
is
concerned
with
a
direction
toward
the
teenage
market
and
not
very
bright
teenagers
at
that.
mr.
william
cahn
and
not
very
bright
teenagers
at
that.
mr.
william
cahn
i
might
agree
mr.
justice
fortas
but
as
i
said
it
has
appeared
from
the
experience
which
i
have
had
with
dealers
--
mr.
william
cahn
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
william
cahn
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
i
think
that
the
mishkin
case
holds
that
it
will
accept
the
characterization
as
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
have
already
mentioned
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
characterization.
in
the
mishkin
and
ginzburg
cases,
i
think
that
very
frankly
that
the
court
has
noticed
the
prurient
interest
of
these
so-called
girly
magazines.
and
in
mishkin,
no
psychiatric
testimony
or
the
light
was
presented
to
show
that
the
material
in
question
appealed
to
the
prurient
interest
of
pseudo
masochist.
however,
484-h
could've
exercised
its
regulatory
effect
constitutionally
even
if
it
were
not
an
obscenity
law
and
thus
the
question
of
whether
the
state's
proof
in
this
case
satisfy
the
obscenity
criteria
of
484-h
is
not
a
federal
question
eligible
for
decision
by
this
court.
since
the
people's
proof
shows
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
sailed
with
the
requisite
scienter
of
nude
photo
magazine,
nude
photo
magazines
to
a
16-year-old
boy.
it
has
proved
all
that
need
to
be
proved
to
justify
criminal
punishment
on
constitutional
grounds
where
the
attribute
of
sovereignty
on
which
the
prosecution
and
statute
is
founded
is
the
state's
power
as
parens
patriae
for
the
benefit
of
children.
since
484-h
is
an
obscenity
law,
i
don't
believe
the
appellant
can
raise
the
first
amendment
objections
through
it
since
under
this
court's
holding
in
the
roth
against
the
united
states
case,
obscenity
is
not
protected
--
is
not
protected
expression.
the
scienter
provision
knowingly
is
not
invalid
on
its
face
because
it
will
not
restrict
by
indirect
effect
the
flow
of
protected
material
to
adults
within
the
rationale
of
smith
against
california.
this
is
so
because
most
adults
are
patently
over
the
age
limit
set
out
in
484-h
under
17
years
of
age.
thus
dealers
will
not
withhold
sale
to
adults
and
will
not
fail
to
make
a
sale
where
the
adult
is
a
customer.
moreover,
the
law
provides
for
the
defensive
honest
mistake
as
to
age.
it
follows
that
the
deal
who
has
made
inquiry
as
to
age
and
receive
reassurance
will
rot
--
will
rely
on
the
honest
mistake
provision
and
will
not
hesitate
to
sell
to
an
adult
at
all
even
if
the
dealer
has
not
examined
the
working
question.
in
the
few
situations
where
age
is
in
doubt,
the
buyer
to
whom
allegedly
the
dealer
might
be
hesitant
to
sell
in
the
absence
of
an
honest
mistake
provision
as
to
age
will
usually
not
be
an
adult
but
instead
will
be
a
youngster.
indeed,
most
youngsters
in
this
marginal
age
group
are
so
young
that
they
have
been
included
in
4
--
that
they
could've
have
been
included
in
484-h's
prohibition
without
giving
constitutional
offense.
thus,
indirect
restriction
on
distribution
to
them
does
not
raise
federal
questions
since
they
could
be
denied
access
by
direct
prohibition,
it's
constitutionally
indifferent
whether
the
state
has
instead
contrived
this
accepts
--
acceptable
denial
of
access
by
indirect
means.
there
is
nothing
constitutionally
objectionable
in
placing
the
burden
of
judgment
on
the
book
dealer
and
to
require
him
to
determine
if
the
material
sold
by
him
comes
within
the
prohibited
class.
in
mishkin,
this
court
approved
the
new
york
statute
namely
section
118
--
44
of
penal
law
the
old
section
1141,
excuse
me,
which
it
viewed
as
placing
the
same
burden
of
judgment
on
book
dealers
as
on
publishers.
appellants
claimed
in
this
regard
a
vagueness
argument
in
disguise.
but
this
court
in
effect
has
held
that
the
definitions
of
obscenity
in
roth
against
united
states,
manual
enterprises
against
day,
jacobellis
against
ohio
and
the
mishkin,
ginzburg
and
fanny
hill
cases
are
adequate.
it
follows
that
the
definitions
in
484-h
give
sufficiently
definite
noticed
of
what
materials
are
within
its
prohibition
and
do
not
place
an
excessive
burden
on
the
deal.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
--
mr.
william
cahn
no,
i
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
agree
that
these
magazines
if
sold
to
adults
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
any
obscenity
statute.
however,
taking
these
magazines
insofar
as
children
are
concerned
i
submit
that
they
are
obscene
--
that
they
have
been
held
obscene
by
our
state's
highest
court
in
accordance
with
definitions
set
forth
in
roth
and
the
other
cases
with
changes
in
phraseology
limiting
its
application
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
variable
concept
doctrine,
is
it
not
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
believe
that
this
is
the
variable
concept
doctrine
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
maybe
mistaken
but
i
believe
this
concept
definitely
applies
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
william
cahn
because
taken
as
a
whole
these
magazines
are
harmful
to
minors
as
our
statute
specifically
states.
that
the
magazines
in
question,
these
magazines
although
not
obscene
to
--
insofar
as
adults
are
concern
when
taken
into
consideration
in
the
juvenile
area
are
harmful
to
minors.
mr.
william
cahn
yes,
because
harmful
--
the
terms
in
the
statute
are
very
explicitly
explained
each
and
every
term
used,
nudity,
sexual
conduct,
sexual
excitement,
sadomasochistic
abuse,
harmful
to
minors
and
prurient
interest
and
so
forth.
each
and
every
item
to
which
the
statute
refers
is
clearly
defined
by
the
statute.
and
the
changes
to
which
i
refer
making
the
overall
magazine
harmful
to
minors
is
that
which
i
asked
to
this
court
to
take
in
to
consideration
to
accept.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
black,
i
cannot
honestly
answer
the
question,
i
don't
know.
i
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
magazine
taken
as
a
whole.
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
see
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
this
court
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
true.
mr.
william
cahn
patently
offensive
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
correct
sir.
and
so,
under
this
particular
statute
great
works
of
art
would
not
be
involved.
the
nudity
in
the
magazine
must
appeal
to
prurient
interest
must
be
without
social
importance.
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
not
any
nude
picture,
the
--
these
magazines
which
contained
pictures
of
nudes
we
contend
that
we
proved
were
directed
to
the
prurient
interest
where
without
social
value
were
provocative,
were
sexual
--
were
for
the
purpose
of
sexually
stimulated.
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
don't
have
the
magazine
with
me
at
this
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
cahn
the
one
in
question?
i
submit
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
submit
that
all
of
these
pictures
as
they
are,
are
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
stimulation
rather
than
for
purposes
of
displaying
great
works
of
art
--
mr.
william
cahn
all
of
these
nudes
in
their
positions,
in
their
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
provocative
positions
--
mr.
william
cahn
insofar
as
children
are
concerned,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
william
cahn
well,
this
is
why
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
respectfully
must
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
white
i
have
enough
of
a
problem
to
cope
with
that
which
i
have
rather
than
to
become
a
profit
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
cahn
this
is
really
up
to
the
court's
to
decide.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
and
the
harmful
to
minors
is
very
vividly
described
in
subdivision
(f).
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
but
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes.
if
it
violated
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
would
say
so.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
that's
in
subdivision
(a).
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
don't
think
he
relied
on
that.
i
think
he
added
that
insofar
as
his
judgment
was
concerned
and
i
think
he
had
absolutely
every
right
to
do
so
under
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
question
about
it
because
he
found
violation
of
paragraph
a
as
well
as
paragraph
d
and
with
the
limited
time
left,
may
i
discuss
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
if
it's
a
straight
suspended
sentence
it's
over.
mr.
william
cahn
the
sentence
is
finished.
yes
sir.
if
provisions
and
limitations
are
set
forth
as
under
the
suspended
sentence
--
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
right.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
don't
see
where
it
has.
mr.
william
cahn
no.
i'm
telling
you
that
this
was
the
punishment
meted
out
by
the
court.
they
found
it
in
his
wisdom
to
give
the
defendant
a
straight
suspended
sentence.
mr.
william
cahn
just
that
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
no.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
no
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
it's
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
--
my
distinguished
colleague
has
called
for
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
understand.
whether
the
question
is
moot,
i
certainly
submit
is
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
think
we've
come
a
long
way
for
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
say
this
and
in
due
respect;
suspended
sentence
or
no,
this
is
a
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
of
a
crime
on
this
man's
record.
and
if
by
a
judgment
of
this
court,
it
is
erased
i
think
it
is
the
--
his
benefit.
mr.
william
cahn
perhaps,
mr.
justice
white
this
may
be
characterized
as
a
more
serious
offense
since
it
involves
possibly
moral
turpitude
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
don't
know
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon?
they
were
obscenity
--
mr.
william
cahn
well
certainly
let
me
say
this
from
myself.
if
i
had
a
misdemeanor
conviction
upon
my
record
and
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
erased,
i
would
seek
every
available
pathway
toward
that
end.
mr.
william
cahn
i
can't
talk
without
seeing
the
cases
themselves
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
asked
you
to
forgive
me
because
i
just
don't
know
the
cases
into
which
--
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
sentence
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
to
be
imposed
mr.
justice
white.
the
case
insofar
as
punishment
is
concerned
is
completely
over
it.
and
may
i
conclude
by
restating
that
it
is
perhaps
impossible
to
determine
or
measure
cause
in
the
realm
of
social
affairs.
it
is
especially
difficult
to
determine
with
certainty
whether
exposure
to
certain
types
of
influences
gradually
shapes
character
or
morals
in
given
ways
since
such
shaping
force
such
--
since
such
shaping
force
works
unobtrusively
and
does
not
manifest
itself
on
dramatic
incidents
of
cause
and
effect.
thus,
persons
who
demand
certain
scientific
proof
maybe
asking
the
impossible.
constitutional
adjudication
must
be
content
with
a
lower
order
of
demonstration
or
the
community
will
be
rendered
helpless
to
protect
itself
against
influences
which
common
knowledge
and
much
expert
opinion
brands
is
dangerous.
it
should
not
be
made
to
run
the
risk
or
to
give
itself
to
give
itself
to
the
uncertain
rhythms
of
scientific
progress.
mr.
william
cahn
the
greatest
social
thinker
of
our
time
robert
(inaudible)
has
observed
that
knowledge
in
the
social
sciences
will
always
be
incomplete
and
imperfect.
i
submit
that
the
danger
of
these
magazines
insofar
as
juveniles
are
concerned
has
clearly
been
established
and
should
be
banned.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
the
danger
itself
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
in
the
cases
that
have
gone
here
before.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
cahn
which
is
that
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
don't
believe
that's
quite
sir
correct
because
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
(inaudible)
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
would
agree
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
information
specifically
charges
in
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
in
the
second
count.
mr.
william
cahn
the
language
here
suggests
harmful
to
minor
in
the
--
and
which
taken
as
a
whole
is
harmful
to
minors.
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
written
as
well
as
the
pictorial
part
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
because
the
entire
statute
gives
reference
mr.
justice
brennan
in
its
description
of
what
is
the
obscene.
mr.
william
cahn
the
charge
mentions
in
the
second
count.
the
defendant
did
violate
the
provisions
of
the
said
section
484-h
subdivision
2(b)
of
the
penal
law
and
that
the
defendant
knowingly
--
did
knowingly
sell
to
a
minor
a
magazine
which
and
taken
as
a
whole
is
harmful
to
minors
and
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
applies
to
the
written
as
well
as
to
the
pictorial
part
of
the
magazine.
i
believe
that
the
major
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
a
state
may
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
enact
the
law
founded
upon
the
variable
obscenity
concept
prohibiting
the
commercial
distribution
to
children
under
17
years
of
age
of
materials
obscene
as
to
such
children
although
not
necessarily
obscene
as
to
adults.
and
whether
the
statute
in
question
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
valid
children's
obscenity
law
whether
its
phraseology
is
sufficiently
definite.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
this
is
a
matter
for
the
legislature
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon?
mr.
william
cahn
well,
the
legislature
found
it
in
its
wisdom
that
the
obscenity
statute
in
reference
to
484-h
should
apply
to
those
under
17
and
perhaps
for
different
reasons
in
the
state
of
texas
found
that
it
should
apply
to
those
under
16
for
the
reason
that
--
the
states
have
considerate
21
to
be
the
age
for
qualified
voting
rather
than
15,
16,
17
or
18.
i
have
no
definite
reason
to
give
you
as
to
why
the
state
legislature
saw
fit
to
limit
its
exercise
over
children
to
the
age
of
17
rather
than
16
or
to
18
or
to
19
or
to
any
other
age
for
that
matter.
and
if
i
may
continue,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statute's
phraseology
is
sufficiently
definite
to
satisfy
the
minimum
requirements
of
due
process
as
they
relate
to
obscenity
and
whether
its
scienter
clause
is
objectionable
or
exerting
an
undue
restraint
on
commercial
distribution
to
adults
of
materials
within
the
prohibition
of
484-h.
484-h,
a
violation
of
which
was
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
is
a
children's
obscenity
law
validly
based
on
the
variable
obscenity
concept
approved
by
this
court
in
mishkin
against
new
york.
it
was
characterized
as
a
children's
obscenity
law
by
new
york's
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
bookcase
incorporated
against
broderick
case
and
this
court
of
course
held
in
mishkin
that
it
will
accept
such
a
characterization.
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
characterization
is
correct
since
the
statute's
definition
of
harmful
to
minors
includes
the
elements
of
this
court's
definition
of
obscenity
that
is
predominant,
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
patent,
offensiveness
and
absence
of
social
importance
with
slight
adjustments
of
wording
necessary
to
relate
and
confined
its
prohibiting
reach
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
cahn
even
though
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
obscene
as
to
adults
and
adults
in
this
particular
statute
are
not
bound
by
the
rigid
concepts
established
by
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
the
broderick
case
rightly
it
is
submitted
that
children
were
a
recipient
group
within
the
mishkin
doctrine
because
they
are
the
group
to
whom
the
objectionable
material
is
directed
or
from
whom
it's
quarantined.
the
court
may
judicially
notice
i
submit
that
these
materials
including
girly
magazines
are
directed
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
because
experience
is
thought
as
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
teenager
is
the
greatest
market
for
these
girly
magazines.
mr.
william
cahn
it
is
submitted
and
suggested
by
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
there
is
none
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
because
of
my
own
experience
your
honor
i
have
found
that
--
mr.
william
cahn
time
has
changed
since
then
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
cahn
the
magazines
which
we
refer,
the
magazines
in
question
are
written
and
insofar
as
my
own
personal
opinion
is
concerned
with
a
direction
toward
the
teenage
market
and
not
very
bright
teenagers
at
that.
mr.
william
cahn
and
not
very
bright
teenagers
at
that.
mr.
william
cahn
i
might
agree
mr.
justice
fortas
but
as
i
said
it
has
appeared
from
the
experience
which
i
have
had
with
dealers
--
mr.
william
cahn
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
william
cahn
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
i
think
that
the
mishkin
case
holds
that
it
will
accept
the
characterization
as
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
have
already
mentioned
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
characterization.
in
the
mishkin
and
ginzburg
cases,
i
think
that
very
frankly
that
the
court
has
noticed
the
prurient
interest
of
these
so-called
girly
magazines.
and
in
mishkin,
no
psychiatric
testimony
or
the
light
was
presented
to
show
that
the
material
in
question
appealed
to
the
prurient
interest
of
pseudo
masochist.
however,
484-h
could've
exercised
its
regulatory
effect
constitutionally
even
if
it
were
not
an
obscenity
law
and
thus
the
question
of
whether
the
state's
proof
in
this
case
satisfy
the
obscenity
criteria
of
484-h
is
not
a
federal
question
eligible
for
decision
by
this
court.
since
the
people's
proof
shows
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
sailed
with
the
requisite
scienter
of
nude
photo
magazine,
nude
photo
magazines
to
a
16-year-old
boy.
it
has
proved
all
that
need
to
be
proved
to
justify
criminal
punishment
on
constitutional
grounds
where
the
attribute
of
sovereignty
on
which
the
prosecution
and
statute
is
founded
is
the
state's
power
as
parens
patriae
for
the
benefit
of
children.
since
484-h
is
an
obscenity
law,
i
don't
believe
the
appellant
can
raise
the
first
amendment
objections
through
it
since
under
this
court's
holding
in
the
roth
against
the
united
states
case,
obscenity
is
not
protected
--
is
not
protected
expression.
the
scienter
provision
knowingly
is
not
invalid
on
its
face
because
it
will
not
restrict
by
indirect
effect
the
flow
of
protected
material
to
adults
within
the
rationale
of
smith
against
california.
this
is
so
because
most
adults
are
patently
over
the
age
limit
set
out
in
484-h
under
17
years
of
age.
thus
dealers
will
not
withhold
sale
to
adults
and
will
not
fail
to
make
a
sale
where
the
adult
is
a
customer.
moreover,
the
law
provides
for
the
defensive
honest
mistake
as
to
age.
it
follows
that
the
deal
who
has
made
inquiry
as
to
age
and
receive
reassurance
will
rot
--
will
rely
on
the
honest
mistake
provision
and
will
not
hesitate
to
sell
to
an
adult
at
all
even
if
the
dealer
has
not
examined
the
working
question.
in
the
few
situations
where
age
is
in
doubt,
the
buyer
to
whom
allegedly
the
dealer
might
be
hesitant
to
sell
in
the
absence
of
an
honest
mistake
provision
as
to
age
will
usually
not
be
an
adult
but
instead
will
be
a
youngster.
indeed,
most
youngsters
in
this
marginal
age
group
are
so
young
that
they
have
been
included
in
4
--
that
they
could've
have
been
included
in
484-h's
prohibition
without
giving
constitutional
offense.
thus,
indirect
restriction
on
distribution
to
them
does
not
raise
federal
questions
since
they
could
be
denied
access
by
direct
prohibition,
it's
constitutionally
indifferent
whether
the
state
has
instead
contrived
this
accepts
--
acceptable
denial
of
access
by
indirect
means.
there
is
nothing
constitutionally
objectionable
in
placing
the
burden
of
judgment
on
the
book
dealer
and
to
require
him
to
determine
if
the
material
sold
by
him
comes
within
the
prohibited
class.
in
mishkin,
this
court
approved
the
new
york
statute
namely
section
118
--
44
of
penal
law
the
old
section
1141,
excuse
me,
which
it
viewed
as
placing
the
same
burden
of
judgment
on
book
dealers
as
on
publishers.
appellants
claimed
in
this
regard
a
vagueness
argument
in
disguise.
but
this
court
in
effect
has
held
that
the
definitions
of
obscenity
in
roth
against
united
states,
manual
enterprises
against
day,
jacobellis
against
ohio
and
the
mishkin,
ginzburg
and
fanny
hill
cases
are
adequate.
it
follows
that
the
definitions
in
484-h
give
sufficiently
definite
noticed
of
what
materials
are
within
its
prohibition
and
do
not
place
an
excessive
burden
on
the
deal.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
--
mr.
william
cahn
no,
i
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
agree
that
these
magazines
if
sold
to
adults
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
any
obscenity
statute.
however,
taking
these
magazines
insofar
as
children
are
concerned
i
submit
that
they
are
obscene
--
that
they
have
been
held
obscene
by
our
state's
highest
court
in
accordance
with
definitions
set
forth
in
roth
and
the
other
cases
with
changes
in
phraseology
limiting
its
application
to
children.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
variable
concept
doctrine,
is
it
not
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
believe
that
this
is
the
variable
concept
doctrine
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
maybe
mistaken
but
i
believe
this
concept
definitely
applies
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
william
cahn
because
taken
as
a
whole
these
magazines
are
harmful
to
minors
as
our
statute
specifically
states.
that
the
magazines
in
question,
these
magazines
although
not
obscene
to
--
insofar
as
adults
are
concern
when
taken
into
consideration
in
the
juvenile
area
are
harmful
to
minors.
mr.
william
cahn
yes,
because
harmful
--
the
terms
in
the
statute
are
very
explicitly
explained
each
and
every
term
used,
nudity,
sexual
conduct,
sexual
excitement,
sadomasochistic
abuse,
harmful
to
minors
and
prurient
interest
and
so
forth.
each
and
every
item
to
which
the
statute
refers
is
clearly
defined
by
the
statute.
and
the
changes
to
which
i
refer
making
the
overall
magazine
harmful
to
minors
is
that
which
i
asked
to
this
court
to
take
in
to
consideration
to
accept.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
black,
i
cannot
honestly
answer
the
question,
i
don't
know.
i
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
magazine
taken
as
a
whole.
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
see
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
this
court
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
true.
mr.
william
cahn
patently
offensive
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
is
correct
sir.
and
so,
under
this
particular
statute
great
works
of
art
would
not
be
involved.
the
nudity
in
the
magazine
must
appeal
to
prurient
interest
must
be
without
social
importance.
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
not
any
nude
picture,
the
--
these
magazines
which
contained
pictures
of
nudes
we
contend
that
we
proved
were
directed
to
the
prurient
interest
where
without
social
value
were
provocative,
were
sexual
--
were
for
the
purpose
of
sexually
stimulated.
mr.
william
cahn
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
don't
have
the
magazine
with
me
at
this
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
cahn
the
one
in
question?
i
submit
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
submit
that
all
of
these
pictures
as
they
are,
are
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
stimulation
rather
than
for
purposes
of
displaying
great
works
of
art
--
mr.
william
cahn
all
of
these
nudes
in
their
positions,
in
their
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
provocative
positions
--
mr.
william
cahn
insofar
as
children
are
concerned,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
william
cahn
well,
this
is
why
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
respectfully
must
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
white
i
have
enough
of
a
problem
to
cope
with
that
which
i
have
rather
than
to
become
a
profit
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
cahn
this
is
really
up
to
the
court's
to
decide.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
and
the
harmful
to
minors
is
very
vividly
described
in
subdivision
(f).
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
but
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes.
if
it
violated
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
would
say
so.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
that's
in
subdivision
(a).
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
i
don't
think
he
relied
on
that.
i
think
he
added
that
insofar
as
his
judgment
was
concerned
and
i
think
he
had
absolutely
every
right
to
do
so
under
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
question
about
it
because
he
found
violation
of
paragraph
a
as
well
as
paragraph
d
and
with
the
limited
time
left,
may
i
discuss
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
if
it's
a
straight
suspended
sentence
it's
over.
mr.
william
cahn
the
sentence
is
finished.
yes
sir.
if
provisions
and
limitations
are
set
forth
as
under
the
suspended
sentence
--
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
right.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
i
don't
see
where
it
has.
mr.
william
cahn
no.
i'm
telling
you
that
this
was
the
punishment
meted
out
by
the
court.
they
found
it
in
his
wisdom
to
give
the
defendant
a
straight
suspended
sentence.
mr.
william
cahn
just
that
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
no.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
no
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
it's
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
--
my
distinguished
colleague
has
called
for
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
understand.
whether
the
question
is
moot,
i
certainly
submit
is
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
think
we've
come
a
long
way
for
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
say
this
and
in
due
respect;
suspended
sentence
or
no,
this
is
a
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
of
a
crime
on
this
man's
record.
and
if
by
a
judgment
of
this
court,
it
is
erased
i
think
it
is
the
--
his
benefit.
mr.
william
cahn
perhaps,
mr.
justice
white
this
may
be
characterized
as
a
more
serious
offense
since
it
involves
possibly
moral
turpitude
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
well,
i
don't
know
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon?
they
were
obscenity
--
mr.
william
cahn
well
certainly
let
me
say
this
from
myself.
if
i
had
a
misdemeanor
conviction
upon
my
record
and
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
erased,
i
would
seek
every
available
pathway
toward
that
end.
mr.
william
cahn
i
can't
talk
without
seeing
the
cases
themselves
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
asked
you
to
forgive
me
because
i
just
don't
know
the
cases
into
which
--
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
sentence
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
to
be
imposed
mr.
justice
white.
the
case
insofar
as
punishment
is
concerned
is
completely
over
it.
and
may
i
conclude
by
restating
that
it
is
perhaps
impossible
to
determine
or
measure
cause
in
the
realm
of
social
affairs.
it
is
especially
difficult
to
determine
with
certainty
whether
exposure
to
certain
types
of
influences
gradually
shapes
character
or
morals
in
given
ways
since
such
shaping
force
such
--
since
such
shaping
force
works
unobtrusively
and
does
not
manifest
itself
on
dramatic
incidents
of
cause
and
effect.
thus,
persons
who
demand
certain
scientific
proof
maybe
asking
the
impossible.
constitutional
adjudication
must
be
content
with
a
lower
order
of
demonstration
or
the
community
will
be
rendered
helpless
to
protect
itself
against
influences
which
common
knowledge
and
much
expert
opinion
brands
is
dangerous.
it
should
not
be
made
to
run
the
risk
or
to
give
itself
to
give
itself
to
the
uncertain
rhythms
of
scientific
progress.
mr.
william
cahn
the
greatest
social
thinker
of
our
time
robert
(inaudible)
has
observed
that
knowledge
in
the
social
sciences
will
always
be
incomplete
and
imperfect.
i
submit
that
the
danger
of
these
magazines
insofar
as
juveniles
are
concerned
has
clearly
been
established
and
should
be
banned.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
the
danger
itself
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
in
the
cases
that
have
gone
here
before.
