justice
abe
fortas
before
you
do
that
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
last
said.
you
mean
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
anybody
except
the
speaker?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
you
can
make
any
sort
of
--
well,
how
do
you
fit
that
with
your
theory
in
this
case
that
--
then
it
would
follow
wouldn't
it
that
you
can
assess
the
scope
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
without
reference
to
the
first
amendment
insofar
as
the
issue
relates
to
who
may
buy
these
magazines,
they
maybe
so-called?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
asking
you
what
you're
approving.
i'm
asking
you
what
you're
understanding
is,
which
you
--
as
you
said
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
the
--
a
right
to
hear,
a
right
to
read
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
did
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
where
does
that
lead
you
in
this
case
then
the
police
power
of
the
state
can
operate
within
reasonable
limits
but
without
any
special
reference
to
the
first
amendment.
i'm
trying
to
understand
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
protective
interest,
your
submission
is
that
the
constitution
protects
not
the
child's
right
to
read
but
the
vendor's
right
to
sell
and
the
author's
derivative
right
to
turn
out
this
store?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
you
relinquish
any
argument
based
upon
the
right
of
children
or
of
adults
for
that
not
to
read?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
not.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
because
that's
surprising
to
me?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
none.
i
have
limited
experience
but
i
know
it
would
not
take
judicial
notice
of
that
fact,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
these
stories
--
is
the
written
material
in
here
to
--
on
the
level
of
what
you
commonly
think
of
as
boys,
of
course
when
i
was
younger,
it
was
the
(inaudible)
boys
and
things
like
that?
justice
abe
fortas
times
had
changed.
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
that
so
as
a
written
material
of
the
--
what
is
specifically
and
specially
a
youthful
kind?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
to
me
this
is
an
important
point
and
--
but
i
don't
know
that
the
--
i
would
--
the
liberty
to
take
your
judgment
for
the
--
and
the
absence
of
anything
in
the
record.
that
is,
i
know
of
nothing
so
far
as
i
have
gone
through
the
record
here
that
would
indicate
that
these
magazines
were
specially
prepared
or
specially
directed
for
the
--
that
segment
of
the
population
which
is
included
in
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
might
agree
or
you
might
not
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
you
sir
because
you
are
--
i
thought
you
agreed
on
response
to
the
questions
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
these
magazines
would
not
be
held
obscene
and
therefore
outside
of
the
first
amendment
protections
in
the
case
of
an
adults.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
comfort
do
you
get
out
of
roth
and
all
the
rest
of
them?
you've
got
to
go
beyond
that,
don't
you,
to
take
care
of
this
particular
case
and
say
that
two
things
are
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
number
one,
the
roth
type
of
thing
as
embellished
by
subsequent
cases
and
number
two,
something
that
is
less
than
roth
in
the
case
of
children,
don't
you
have
to
take
that
position?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
state's
--
from
your
state
courts
might
have
held
that
over
and
over
again.but
by
on
the
basis
of
a
colloquy
between
you
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
court
would
have
to
say
that
these
particular
magazines
here
are
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
if
you
relied
only
on
roth
and
our
decisions
today.
now
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
and
i
perhaps
you
have
to
ask
us
to
do
is
to
come
out
with
another
category.
category
restricted
to
statutes
dealing
with
children.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
in
the
statute,
i
certainly
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
be
straightened
out
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
is
the
--
what
would
you
add
to
the
roth
definition
or
subtract
on
the
roth
definition
in
the
case
of
children
or
why
do
you
say
that
these
magazines
although
by
hypothesis
would
not
be
held
obscene
in
the
case
of
adults
should
be
held
to
be
within
the
first
amendment
--
it
should
be
held
outside
of
the
first
amendment
protection
in
the
case
of
children?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
--
and
we
have
to
sustain
that
as
being
sufficiently
precise
and
not
too
broad
or
too
vague
for
first
amendment
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
that
have
any
consequence
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
it's
just
like
a
sort
of
reprimand,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what's
a
straight
suspended
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
mean
that
he
can
--
ever
be
put
in
jail
for
this
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
could
he
ever
be
fined
for
this?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
sort
of
a
reprimand,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
has
been
established
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you

i'm
