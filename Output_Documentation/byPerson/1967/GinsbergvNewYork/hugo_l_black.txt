what's
the
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
review
the
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
that's
a
very
important
issue
if
he
was
charged
in
one
thing
and
convicted
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean,
you're
waiving
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
pressing
it.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there's
something
else
that's
more
important?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
us
suppose
this
is
based
on
the
premise
that
minors
or
at
least
--
they're
only
16
or
18
have
less
iq
than
those
of
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
really
what
they're
talking
about
here
and
all
of
these
i
presume
is
the
kind
to
protect
people
with
low
iqs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
presume
if
you
can
--
had
the
right
to
read
it
on
the
age,
you
can
decide
upon
the
iqs,
isn't
that
constitutionally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
most
everyone
known
people
of
16
who
had
far
more
iq
or
whatever
that
is,
a
man
of
50.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
men
of
50?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
--
returning
to
your
first
argument,
what
page
did
you
say
it
to
be
found
on
that
the
judge
can
rely
not
merely
on
the
pictures
of
nudity
but
on
the
literature
that
was
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
statute
but
the
charge
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
your
court
has
ever
sustained
this
particular
charge
made
in
count
two,
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
it
charged
anything
more
than
the
fact
that
these
were
bad
because
they
add
pictures
of
nude
persons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
as
i
read
it,
i
read
a
different
--
draw
a
different
inference
to
yours.
it
seems
to
me,
that
what
they
are
saying
that
taken
as
a
whole
these
pictures
of
nude
persons
are
harmful
to
minors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
find
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
(inaudible),
it
seems
to
me
like
it
means
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
construed
it
the
other
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
it
now
why
you
think
it
doesn't
end?
what
else
should
be
done
to
it?
justice
hugo

what
else
could
