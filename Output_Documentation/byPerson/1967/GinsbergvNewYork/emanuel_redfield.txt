mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
a
conviction
of
the
appellant
for
having
violated
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
since
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
this
case
for
review,
the
appellate
term
as
the
court
in
which
--
it
was
a
final
court
in
which
a
judgment
could
be
had.
and
this
judgment
raises
several
important
and
noble
questions.
and
the
first
one
is,
was
there
on
its
face
and
in
its
operation,
is
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
repugnant
to
the
constitution,
the
amendment
--
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
acts
as
a
restraint
upon
expression.
the
second
question
is,
is
the
statute
vague
and
overbroad
by
its
terms
and
its
standards
if
it
has
meaningful
standards?
and
third,
is
this
publication
or
before
publications
involved
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
in
other
words,
was
the
act
validly
applied
to
this
particular
plaint
--
appellant.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
your
honors
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
mean
constitutionally.
in
other
words
of
these
--
is
this
particular
magazine
for
example
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
was
in
the
scope
but
as
applied,
as
the
statute
has
been
applied
and
construed
with
respect
to
this
particular
publication
can
you
condemn
this
appellant.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
in
it.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
your
honors
that
if
this
weren't
a
criminal
conviction
and
i
had
a
choice
in
the
matter
i
would
have
not
--
confining
the
issue
solely
to
the
first
question
because
i
think
the
issue
was
right.
and
not
only
is
it
right
but
i
think
it
is
imperative
that
a
decision
be
reached
on
that
point
even
if
the
appellant
can
be
victorious
on
any
of
the
other
points.
i
think
your
honors,
should
at
this
time
undertake
the
task
of
putting
–
address
this
question
which
has
caused
so
many
uncertainties
and
so
much
debate.
and
the
question
comes
down
to
this,
whether
the
power
of
the
state
maybe
exercised
to
punish
a
person
who
sells
certain
publications
enumerated
in
the
statute
to
persons
based
on
the
age
of
the
reader
or
the
purchaser.
and
i
say
too
that
the
basic
question
--
that
basic
question
falls
unto
two
categories.
the
first,
as
a
matter
of
principle,
is
it
repugnant
to
the
constitution
and
secondly,
that
by
its
operation
in
effect
as
a
pragmatic
question,
does
it
intimidate
the
vendor
and
publisher
of
books
to
the
point
where
it
become
censorship?
in
other
words,
the
second
question
to
be
clear
is
similar
to
the
question
that
was
raised
and
decided
in
smith
against
california.
smith
against
california
you
recall
was
a
purely
practical
decision
because
the
court
found
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
intimidation
resulted
was
its
consequent
censorship.
now,
the
court
below
and
--
meaning
the
appellate
term
in
writing
for
affirmance
wrote
nothing
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
stated
nothing
but
i
suspect
from
the
argument
that
went
on
that
it's
determination
came
about
because
of
the
case
of
the
bookcase
against
broderick
which
was
decided
about
a
year
ago
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
i
brought
to
this
court.
the
bookcase
decision
rested
on
a
dictum
in
the
jacobellis
case
and
also
rested
on
the
dissenting
language
in
people
against
bookcase
in
which
case,
a
prior
law
had
been
rendered
unconstitutional
by
the
highest
court
of
new
york.
so
at
this
point,
i
cannot
give
you
the
ultimate
construction
of
the
statute
as
rendered
in
this
case
but
can
only
refer
you
to
what
was
said
in
bookcase
against
broderick.
my
appellant
who
received
the
suspended
sentence
is
not
a
flamboyant
vendor
nor
a
self-seeking
or
say
like
charging
along
in
the
rights
of
free
speech.
he
is
just
the
poor,
simple,
humble
owner
of
a
candy
store
or
stationary
store
or
a
newspaper
(inaudible)
that
sort
of
a
place
that
is
so
common
throughout
this
country.
he
has
this
little
store
which
of
size
70
by
--
seven
by
30
feet
in
the
little
village
of
bellmore,
long
island,
new
york.
and
he
works
from
morning
to
late
at
night
with
his
wife
to
eat
out
in
existence.
and
it's
so
much
though,
that
he
had
to
shut
the
store
for
about
three
days
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial
under
this
case.
and
as
i
said,
he
sells
almost
everything
that
that
type
of
a
store
sells
and
as
part
of
it,
he
carries
about
200
titles
of
magazines.
he
has
no
choice
in
these
titles,
they
are
sent
to
him
automatically
by
the
jobbers.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they're
sort
of
tie-in
and
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
he
doesn't
write
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
has
to
take
that
or
i'll
--
let's
put
it
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
in
the
record
but
not
as
a
tie-in
and
not
--
is
not
developed
to
that
extent
but
it
is
developed
to
the
extent
what
--
which
we
properly
know
in
the
field
and
that
is
that
he
doesn't
order
these
magazines,
they
just
come
to
him
from
the
distributor.
now,
the
charge
against
him
was
on
october
18th,
1965
he
sold
two
magazines,
one
called
mr.
annual
and
the
other
is
sarah
this
thing
and
if
your
honors
recall
just
a
few
months
ago
as
i
can
recall,
you
had
this
particular
title
before
you
in
the
case
of
gent
versus
arkansas
which
i
argued
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
sarah
is
in
the
name
of
the
magazine.
it's
not
the
same
issue
as
involved
in
gent
but
it's
of
similar
publication,
it's
a
girly
type
of
magazine
that
in
nearly
date
we
used
to
call
them
police
gazette
magazines.
and
now
they
call
it
“girly”
and
then
there
was
another
charge
against
him.
then
on
october
26,
1965,
he
sold
magazine
called
“man
to
man”
an
escapade
to
a
similar
type
of
magazines.
and
it
should
be
observed,
why
--
of
course
he
sold
them
to
this
boy
of
16
years
of
age.
it
should
be
observed
that
the
charge
here
is
only
that
these
pictures
contain
nudes
and
i
should
--
that
the
magazines
contained
pictures
that
were
nudes
and
that
these
were
harmful
to
minors.
that's
all
the
charge
is
and
i
emphasize
it
because
you
will
see
in
a
few
minutes
that
the
judge
made
findings
which
extended
beyond
that
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i'm
not
asking
to
review
it
but
you
could
only
take
on
the
findings
upon
which
he
was
charged,
cole
against
arkansas
situation,
he
was
only
charged
with
a
certain
crime.
it
can
only
be
found
under
that
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
right
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that
should
be
disregarded
because
i
don't
think
its
part
of
the
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
defendant
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
he
was
overruled
and
was
convicted,
the
appellate
terms
they
said
before
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
review.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
because
he
wasn't
charged
with
the
reading
matter,
he
was
charged
merely
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
charge
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
charge
was
that
he
--
that
these
magazines
contained
nude
pictures,
that's
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
you'll
find
the
charge
on
page
2
and
4
in
the
record.
but
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
that
too
much
although
i
bring
it
to
your
attention.
i
think
there
are
more
important
issues
in
this
case.
yes,
you
--
the
charges
on
page
2
to
4
of
the
record.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
a
--
but
i
say
its
subsidiary
to
my
main
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i'm
not
waiving
it.
since
as
i've
said
before
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime,
i
can't
waive
it.
i'd
rely
upon
it
as
the
last
straw.
the
judge
after
the
trial
made
the
following
finding
that
the
boy
was
16
years
of
age
and
that
the
defendant
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
that
he
was
under
17
years
of
age
and
all
the
magazines
in
question
contained
pictures
of
nudes.
and
then
he
made
a
charge
--
finding
that
the
magazine
escapade
and
mr.
annual
contain
variable
descriptions
and
narrative
accounts
of
sexual
excitement
and
sexual
conduct,
so
you
see,
there
alone,
it
goes
beyond
the
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
on
page
--
i'm
reading
from
page
5
--
yes,
in
the
record,
its
on
page
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
scope
of
the
charge
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
but
as
i
say
i'm
not
pressing
that
as
the
ultimate
decision
in
this
case
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
mean
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
mean
my
emphasis
here
is
for
a
decision
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i
do.
i
do
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i'm
not
trying
to
make
it
harder
for
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
try
also
nothing,
sometimes
i
succeed,
in
other
times
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
--
well,
i
also
place
that
emphasis
i
should
say
because
many
people
confused
as
ginsberg
was
another
ginsberg
that
was
here
before
and
i
think
that
distinction
is
very
clear
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
got
to
suspended
sentence.
the
judge
thought
so
highly
of
him
that
the
man
in
the
community
was
worthy
of
his
indulgence
and
he
suspended
the
sentence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
didn't
mention,
he
just
said
suspended
sentence
and
that
was
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
didn't
impose
any
sentence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
just
said,
suspended
sentence.
it's
very
common
practice
in
new
york
to
state
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
remember
that
but
i
haven't
--
you
know
i
should
men
--
it
should
be
pointed
out
too
that
this
statute
is
directed
at
those
who
sell
the
magazines
for
a
monetary
consideration.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
given
away,
the
person
couldn't
be
guilty
of
the
crime
but
if
he
got
money
for
it,
it
made
a
big
difference.
and
the
reason
i
emphasize
this
is
so
that
you
could
see
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
statute
right
off
because
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
restrict
the
promiscuous
circulation
of
this
type
of
magazine
to
those
under
17
they
certainly
haven't
attained
that
even
in
the
text
because
it
can
be
distributed
to
those
who
will
not
pay
a
monetary
consideration.
in
other
words,
if
one
of
tom
sawyer's
crowd
came
along
and
offered
a
bookseller
an
apple,
that
would
be
alright?
but
if
he
got
ten
cents
for
it,
he
can
go
to
jail
for
a
year.
now,
of
course
we
all
would
like
to
have
the
best
of
literature
for
the
children
and
i
would
say
also
for
adults
and
perhaps
if
i
were
an
emperor,
i
would
say
there
are
certain
25
books
that
everybody
can't
--
may
read
and
that
would
be
it
but
since
i'm
not
an
emperor
and
i
do
not
care
to
tell
anybody
what
they
may
read,
i
have
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
great
wisdom
in
this
law.
and
also
point
out
the
fact
that
several
of
the
amicus
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
columbia
law
review
had
found
some
solace
in
the
recent
gold
case
in
which
children's
right
to
read
should
be
considered
and
protected
because
children
wished
to
be
free
of
the
orthodoxy
of
adults.
but
--
and
this
relates
too
to
the
observation
made
earlier
today
that
children
do
not
have
freedom
of
speech
as
much
as
adult.
therefore,
they're
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
seriously
doubt
if
the
basis
for
the
protection
of
the
constitution
rest
on
the
freedom
of
choice
of
children
that
is
that
the
assumption
made
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
because
adults
have
a
greater
freedom
of
choice
therefore
the
children
have
to
be
protected.
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
adults
have
that
free
to
choice.
my
opinion,
people
are
great
imitators,
adult
also
sheep
like
everybody
else
and
the
tendency
is
to
follow
the
leader.
i
think
the
gist
of
the
first
amendment
is
not
that
there
is
a
freedom
of
choice
in
the
(inaudible)
as
there
is
a
freedom
of
expression
and
the
speaker
was
a
writer
or
the
publisher,
that's
what
we're
protecting.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
speaks
of
the
audience.
it's
good
to
turn
in
this
argument
to
the
beginning
of
the
things
and
i
start
with
roth.
roth
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
i
wasn't
approving
any
--
i
wasn't
approving
any
such
doctrine
that
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
first
amendment
does
direct,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
said
that
the
first
amendment
is
directed
to
the
rights
of
the
speaker
not
so
much
as
to
the
right
of
the
individual
or
the
regulation
of
the
receiver
of
the
information.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
here
--
what
my
protection
is
here
is
the
protection
of
the
vendor
which
is
the
same
as
the
first
amendment
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
well,
i
meant
that
in
this
respect,
i
said
that
there
were
others
who
went
further
than
i
did
in
this
case,
the
amicus
and
the
(inaudible)
law
review
who
say
that
the
gold
case
protects
the
right
of
the
reader
or
the
child
in
this
case
but
i
wasn't
pressing
that
issue,
i
on
other
hand
was
protecting
the
right
of
the
vendor
or
the
expresser
of
any
idea.
so,
i'd
say
this
that
the
burden
of
proof
as
we
know
are
the
restraint
on
speech
is
of
really
a
very
heavy
one
and
the
burden
is
that
of
the
state
who
would
like
to
--
who
would
restrain
this
right.
but
in
anticipation
--
in
other
words,
i
could
say
let's
wait
in
here
from
the
state
and
see
what
they
have
to
say
on
their
side.
but
in
anticipation
of
that,
i
would
like
to
raise
these
questions,
where
is
this
authority
derived?
the
constitution
says,
there
shall
be
no
abridgement
to
speech
and
then
roth,
you
said,
“well,
so
far
as
obscenity
is
concerned
there
has
been
a
history
although
some
have
debated
that
history
to
respect
you
justice
brennan”.
and
the
--
so
the
question
comes
up,
“where
in
the
constitution
can
you
justify
a
restraint
based
upon
the
age
of
the
reader?”
and
i
for
myself
cannot
find
such
authority.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
so
i
thought
it's
above
that
age.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
and
how
you're
going
to
determine
those
iqs
to
begin
with
and
how
about
those
who
are
above
the
age,
about
50-year-olds
who
don't
have
the
iq
and
how
about
those
who've
set
--
16
years
who
have
the
iqs?
who
is
going
to
determine
that
and
why
should
anybody
be
subjected
to
this?
and
specially
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
whether
--
if
that
was
so,
i
don't
know
what
we
do
about
it
--
i
mean
i
don't
know
how
we
could
administer
such
a
law
or
how
to
or
better
yet
how
one
could
sell
books
on
--
or
magazines
under
that
type
of
the
law.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i've
argued
here.
and
the
--
and
oh,
--
and
you
could
immediately
see
the
pandora's
box
that
is
being
opened
here
and
when
you
realize
that
the
objectives
of
these
law
can
never
really
be
attained.
i
argued
in
my
brief
that
these
objectives
are
not
attained
because
the
younger
children
could
get
them
from
elders,
they
can
always
find
them
around.
secondly,
what
is
even
worst
in
order
to
prosecute
anybody
you'd
have
to
do
what
you
did
in
this
case
and
that
is
involved
the
youngsters
in
the
criminal
court.
the
youngster
in
this
case
was
acted
as
a
decoy
in
the
case
that
was
specially
framed
for
the
purposes
of
enforcing
this
law.
and
of
all
the
most
remarkable
things
that
i
know
of
that
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
in
opposition
to
my
position
the
citizens
with
decent
literature
took
the
very
same
position
that
this
law
cannot
be
enforced
and
its
worst
than
if
there
were
no
such
law
because
the
debasement
of
the
child
is
a
factor
that
is
worst
than
the
literature
that
they
could
read.
i
have
a
great
deal
more
to
argue
but
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
i'll
have
to
rely
upon
my
brief.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
248,
the
last
paragraph
from
the
button
of
that
page.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
few
minutes,
as
to
the
question
of
mootness
your
honors
on
the
very
day
that
you
dismissed
those
other
cases,
one
was
the
tannenbaum
case
and
the
--
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
other
one.
this
case
was
granted
review
and
the
year
had
not
passed
under
new
york
law
in
which
there
could
be
execution
under
that
sentence.
so,
well
i'm
not
prepared
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
to
argue
that
case
now.
that
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
wouldn't
go
along
with
that
because
it's
a
very
same
statute
you
had
in
the
tannenbaum
case
and
in
the
other
case
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
within
the
year.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
but
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
yes,
right.
but
that
wasn't
the
gist
of
the
decision.
the
gist
was
that
there
could
still
have
been
execution
within
the
year's
time
and
while
it
may
--
perhaps
at
this
moment,
i
don't
know.
i
have
to
study
the
point.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
while
at
this
moment,
the
year
might
have
passed
that
the
time
you
granted
review
certainly
at
the
time
when
this
case
was
lodged
in
this
court
though
the
year
have
not
passed.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
wouldn't
accept
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
alright.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
really
have
it
in
the
other
cases
because
the
law
set
forth
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'll
be
happy
to.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
what
else
is
to
be
done?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
at
this
moment,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
your
honor
because
this
is
the
point
i
haven't
even
examined.
all
i
know
is
this
man
has
this
conviction
against
him
and
under
new
york
law
a
second
conviction
would
result
in
more
serious
punishment
to
him.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
but
aside
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
yes,
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
have
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
you
have
that
in
the
other
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
if
you
look
at
the
record,
let's
say
in
the
mishkin
case
for
example,
you
had
that
situation
where
a
second
conviction
led
to
a
higher
sentence
--
mishkin
have
been
convicted
once
before
the
case,
he
was
in
here
before
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
was
(inaudible)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
he
got
three
years
--
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
the
law
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
mean,
whether
it's
compulsory
or
whether
it's
discretionary
to
judge,
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
i'll
be
happy
to
present
that
but
before
i
terminate,
i'd
like
to
point
out
something
that
is
substantive
interest
and
that
is
the
reliance
here
upon
mishkin.
i
don't
think
this
case
has
been
disposed
of
by
mishkin.
first
of
all,
in
mishkin
you
had
a
deviate
class
and
it
was
not
one
of
age.
in
mishkin,
you
have
the
books,
the
court
found
that
the
books
were
directed
toward
this
group
and
there
were
prurient
appeal
to
that
particular
group.
he
have
an
entirely
different
question
of
age,
and
your
honor
was
very
careful
to
point
out
to
avoid
hicklin
being
revived
by
saying
the
following,
“since
our
holding
requires
that
the
recipient
group
be
defined
with
more
specificity
than
in
terms
of
sexually
immature
persons,
it
also
avoid
the
inadequacy
of
the
most
susceptible
person
facet
of
the
hicklin
rule”.
thank
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
a
conviction
of
the
appellant
for
having
violated
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
since
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
this
case
for
review,
the
appellate
term
as
the
court
in
which
--
it
was
a
final
court
in
which
a
judgment
could
be
had.
and
this
judgment
raises
several
important
and
noble
questions.
and
the
first
one
is,
was
there
on
its
face
and
in
its
operation,
is
section
484-h
of
the
penal
law
repugnant
to
the
constitution,
the
amendment
--
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
acts
as
a
restraint
upon
expression.
the
second
question
is,
is
the
statute
vague
and
overbroad
by
its
terms
and
its
standards
if
it
has
meaningful
standards?
and
third,
is
this
publication
or
before
publications
involved
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
in
other
words,
was
the
act
validly
applied
to
this
particular
plaint
--
appellant.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
your
honors
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
mean
constitutionally.
in
other
words
of
these
--
is
this
particular
magazine
for
example
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
was
in
the
scope
but
as
applied,
as
the
statute
has
been
applied
and
construed
with
respect
to
this
particular
publication
can
you
condemn
this
appellant.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
in
it.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
your
honors
that
if
this
weren't
a
criminal
conviction
and
i
had
a
choice
in
the
matter
i
would
have
not
--
confining
the
issue
solely
to
the
first
question
because
i
think
the
issue
was
right.
and
not
only
is
it
right
but
i
think
it
is
imperative
that
a
decision
be
reached
on
that
point
even
if
the
appellant
can
be
victorious
on
any
of
the
other
points.
i
think
your
honors,
should
at
this
time
undertake
the
task
of
putting
–
address
this
question
which
has
caused
so
many
uncertainties
and
so
much
debate.
and
the
question
comes
down
to
this,
whether
the
power
of
the
state
maybe
exercised
to
punish
a
person
who
sells
certain
publications
enumerated
in
the
statute
to
persons
based
on
the
age
of
the
reader
or
the
purchaser.
and
i
say
too
that
the
basic
question
--
that
basic
question
falls
unto
two
categories.
the
first,
as
a
matter
of
principle,
is
it
repugnant
to
the
constitution
and
secondly,
that
by
its
operation
in
effect
as
a
pragmatic
question,
does
it
intimidate
the
vendor
and
publisher
of
books
to
the
point
where
it
become
censorship?
in
other
words,
the
second
question
to
be
clear
is
similar
to
the
question
that
was
raised
and
decided
in
smith
against
california.
smith
against
california
you
recall
was
a
purely
practical
decision
because
the
court
found
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
intimidation
resulted
was
its
consequent
censorship.
now,
the
court
below
and
--
meaning
the
appellate
term
in
writing
for
affirmance
wrote
nothing
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
stated
nothing
but
i
suspect
from
the
argument
that
went
on
that
it's
determination
came
about
because
of
the
case
of
the
bookcase
against
broderick
which
was
decided
about
a
year
ago
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
i
brought
to
this
court.
the
bookcase
decision
rested
on
a
dictum
in
the
jacobellis
case
and
also
rested
on
the
dissenting
language
in
people
against
bookcase
in
which
case,
a
prior
law
had
been
rendered
unconstitutional
by
the
highest
court
of
new
york.
so
at
this
point,
i
cannot
give
you
the
ultimate
construction
of
the
statute
as
rendered
in
this
case
but
can
only
refer
you
to
what
was
said
in
bookcase
against
broderick.
my
appellant
who
received
the
suspended
sentence
is
not
a
flamboyant
vendor
nor
a
self-seeking
or
say
like
charging
along
in
the
rights
of
free
speech.
he
is
just
the
poor,
simple,
humble
owner
of
a
candy
store
or
stationary
store
or
a
newspaper
(inaudible)
that
sort
of
a
place
that
is
so
common
throughout
this
country.
he
has
this
little
store
which
of
size
70
by
--
seven
by
30
feet
in
the
little
village
of
bellmore,
long
island,
new
york.
and
he
works
from
morning
to
late
at
night
with
his
wife
to
eat
out
in
existence.
and
it's
so
much
though,
that
he
had
to
shut
the
store
for
about
three
days
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial
under
this
case.
and
as
i
said,
he
sells
almost
everything
that
that
type
of
a
store
sells
and
as
part
of
it,
he
carries
about
200
titles
of
magazines.
he
has
no
choice
in
these
titles,
they
are
sent
to
him
automatically
by
the
jobbers.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they're
sort
of
tie-in
and
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
he
doesn't
write
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
has
to
take
that
or
i'll
--
let's
put
it
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
in
the
record
but
not
as
a
tie-in
and
not
--
is
not
developed
to
that
extent
but
it
is
developed
to
the
extent
what
--
which
we
properly
know
in
the
field
and
that
is
that
he
doesn't
order
these
magazines,
they
just
come
to
him
from
the
distributor.
now,
the
charge
against
him
was
on
october
18th,
1965
he
sold
two
magazines,
one
called
mr.
annual
and
the
other
is
sarah
this
thing
and
if
your
honors
recall
just
a
few
months
ago
as
i
can
recall,
you
had
this
particular
title
before
you
in
the
case
of
gent
versus
arkansas
which
i
argued
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
sarah
is
in
the
name
of
the
magazine.
it's
not
the
same
issue
as
involved
in
gent
but
it's
of
similar
publication,
it's
a
girly
type
of
magazine
that
in
nearly
date
we
used
to
call
them
police
gazette
magazines.
and
now
they
call
it
“girly”
and
then
there
was
another
charge
against
him.
then
on
october
26,
1965,
he
sold
magazine
called
“man
to
man”
an
escapade
to
a
similar
type
of
magazines.
and
it
should
be
observed,
why
--
of
course
he
sold
them
to
this
boy
of
16
years
of
age.
it
should
be
observed
that
the
charge
here
is
only
that
these
pictures
contain
nudes
and
i
should
--
that
the
magazines
contained
pictures
that
were
nudes
and
that
these
were
harmful
to
minors.
that's
all
the
charge
is
and
i
emphasize
it
because
you
will
see
in
a
few
minutes
that
the
judge
made
findings
which
extended
beyond
that
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i'm
not
asking
to
review
it
but
you
could
only
take
on
the
findings
upon
which
he
was
charged,
cole
against
arkansas
situation,
he
was
only
charged
with
a
certain
crime.
it
can
only
be
found
under
that
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
right
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that
should
be
disregarded
because
i
don't
think
its
part
of
the
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
defendant
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
he
was
overruled
and
was
convicted,
the
appellate
terms
they
said
before
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
review.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
because
he
wasn't
charged
with
the
reading
matter,
he
was
charged
merely
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
charge
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
charge
was
that
he
--
that
these
magazines
contained
nude
pictures,
that's
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
you'll
find
the
charge
on
page
2
and
4
in
the
record.
but
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
that
too
much
although
i
bring
it
to
your
attention.
i
think
there
are
more
important
issues
in
this
case.
yes,
you
--
the
charges
on
page
2
to
4
of
the
record.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
a
--
but
i
say
its
subsidiary
to
my
main
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i'm
not
waiving
it.
since
as
i've
said
before
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime,
i
can't
waive
it.
i'd
rely
upon
it
as
the
last
straw.
the
judge
after
the
trial
made
the
following
finding
that
the
boy
was
16
years
of
age
and
that
the
defendant
knew
or
had
reason
to
know
that
he
was
under
17
years
of
age
and
all
the
magazines
in
question
contained
pictures
of
nudes.
and
then
he
made
a
charge
--
finding
that
the
magazine
escapade
and
mr.
annual
contain
variable
descriptions
and
narrative
accounts
of
sexual
excitement
and
sexual
conduct,
so
you
see,
there
alone,
it
goes
beyond
the
charge.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
on
page
--
i'm
reading
from
page
5
--
yes,
in
the
record,
its
on
page
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
scope
of
the
charge
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
but
as
i
say
i'm
not
pressing
that
as
the
ultimate
decision
in
this
case
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
mean
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
mean
my
emphasis
here
is
for
a
decision
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
i
do.
i
do
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i'm
not
trying
to
make
it
harder
for
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
try
also
nothing,
sometimes
i
succeed,
in
other
times
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
--
well,
i
also
place
that
emphasis
i
should
say
because
many
people
confused
as
ginsberg
was
another
ginsberg
that
was
here
before
and
i
think
that
distinction
is
very
clear
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
got
to
suspended
sentence.
the
judge
thought
so
highly
of
him
that
the
man
in
the
community
was
worthy
of
his
indulgence
and
he
suspended
the
sentence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
didn't
mention,
he
just
said
suspended
sentence
and
that
was
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
didn't
impose
any
sentence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
just
said,
suspended
sentence.
it's
very
common
practice
in
new
york
to
state
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
remember
that
but
i
haven't
--
you
know
i
should
men
--
it
should
be
pointed
out
too
that
this
statute
is
directed
at
those
who
sell
the
magazines
for
a
monetary
consideration.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
given
away,
the
person
couldn't
be
guilty
of
the
crime
but
if
he
got
money
for
it,
it
made
a
big
difference.
and
the
reason
i
emphasize
this
is
so
that
you
could
see
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
statute
right
off
because
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
restrict
the
promiscuous
circulation
of
this
type
of
magazine
to
those
under
17
they
certainly
haven't
attained
that
even
in
the
text
because
it
can
be
distributed
to
those
who
will
not
pay
a
monetary
consideration.
in
other
words,
if
one
of
tom
sawyer's
crowd
came
along
and
offered
a
bookseller
an
apple,
that
would
be
alright?
but
if
he
got
ten
cents
for
it,
he
can
go
to
jail
for
a
year.
now,
of
course
we
all
would
like
to
have
the
best
of
literature
for
the
children
and
i
would
say
also
for
adults
and
perhaps
if
i
were
an
emperor,
i
would
say
there
are
certain
25
books
that
everybody
can't
--
may
read
and
that
would
be
it
but
since
i'm
not
an
emperor
and
i
do
not
care
to
tell
anybody
what
they
may
read,
i
have
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
great
wisdom
in
this
law.
and
also
point
out
the
fact
that
several
of
the
amicus
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
columbia
law
review
had
found
some
solace
in
the
recent
gold
case
in
which
children's
right
to
read
should
be
considered
and
protected
because
children
wished
to
be
free
of
the
orthodoxy
of
adults.
but
--
and
this
relates
too
to
the
observation
made
earlier
today
that
children
do
not
have
freedom
of
speech
as
much
as
adult.
therefore,
they're
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
seriously
doubt
if
the
basis
for
the
protection
of
the
constitution
rest
on
the
freedom
of
choice
of
children
that
is
that
the
assumption
made
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
because
adults
have
a
greater
freedom
of
choice
therefore
the
children
have
to
be
protected.
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
adults
have
that
free
to
choice.
my
opinion,
people
are
great
imitators,
adult
also
sheep
like
everybody
else
and
the
tendency
is
to
follow
the
leader.
i
think
the
gist
of
the
first
amendment
is
not
that
there
is
a
freedom
of
choice
in
the
(inaudible)
as
there
is
a
freedom
of
expression
and
the
speaker
was
a
writer
or
the
publisher,
that's
what
we're
protecting.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
speaks
of
the
audience.
it's
good
to
turn
in
this
argument
to
the
beginning
of
the
things
and
i
start
with
roth.
roth
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
i
wasn't
approving
any
--
i
wasn't
approving
any
such
doctrine
that
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
first
amendment
does
direct,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
said
that
the
first
amendment
is
directed
to
the
rights
of
the
speaker
not
so
much
as
to
the
right
of
the
individual
or
the
regulation
of
the
receiver
of
the
information.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
here
--
what
my
protection
is
here
is
the
protection
of
the
vendor
which
is
the
same
as
the
first
amendment
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
well
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
well,
i
meant
that
in
this
respect,
i
said
that
there
were
others
who
went
further
than
i
did
in
this
case,
the
amicus
and
the
(inaudible)
law
review
who
say
that
the
gold
case
protects
the
right
of
the
reader
or
the
child
in
this
case
but
i
wasn't
pressing
that
issue,
i
on
other
hand
was
protecting
the
right
of
the
vendor
or
the
expresser
of
any
idea.
so,
i'd
say
this
that
the
burden
of
proof
as
we
know
are
the
restraint
on
speech
is
of
really
a
very
heavy
one
and
the
burden
is
that
of
the
state
who
would
like
to
--
who
would
restrain
this
right.
but
in
anticipation
--
in
other
words,
i
could
say
let's
wait
in
here
from
the
state
and
see
what
they
have
to
say
on
their
side.
but
in
anticipation
of
that,
i
would
like
to
raise
these
questions,
where
is
this
authority
derived?
the
constitution
says,
there
shall
be
no
abridgement
to
speech
and
then
roth,
you
said,
“well,
so
far
as
obscenity
is
concerned
there
has
been
a
history
although
some
have
debated
that
history
to
respect
you
justice
brennan”.
and
the
--
so
the
question
comes
up,
“where
in
the
constitution
can
you
justify
a
restraint
based
upon
the
age
of
the
reader?”
and
i
for
myself
cannot
find
such
authority.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
so
i
thought
it's
above
that
age.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
and
how
you're
going
to
determine
those
iqs
to
begin
with
and
how
about
those
who
are
above
the
age,
about
50-year-olds
who
don't
have
the
iq
and
how
about
those
who've
set
--
16
years
who
have
the
iqs?
who
is
going
to
determine
that
and
why
should
anybody
be
subjected
to
this?
and
specially
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
whether
--
if
that
was
so,
i
don't
know
what
we
do
about
it
--
i
mean
i
don't
know
how
we
could
administer
such
a
law
or
how
to
or
better
yet
how
one
could
sell
books
on
--
or
magazines
under
that
type
of
the
law.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
i've
argued
here.
and
the
--
and
oh,
--
and
you
could
immediately
see
the
pandora's
box
that
is
being
opened
here
and
when
you
realize
that
the
objectives
of
these
law
can
never
really
be
attained.
i
argued
in
my
brief
that
these
objectives
are
not
attained
because
the
younger
children
could
get
them
from
elders,
they
can
always
find
them
around.
secondly,
what
is
even
worst
in
order
to
prosecute
anybody
you'd
have
to
do
what
you
did
in
this
case
and
that
is
involved
the
youngsters
in
the
criminal
court.
the
youngster
in
this
case
was
acted
as
a
decoy
in
the
case
that
was
specially
framed
for
the
purposes
of
enforcing
this
law.
and
of
all
the
most
remarkable
things
that
i
know
of
that
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
in
opposition
to
my
position
the
citizens
with
decent
literature
took
the
very
same
position
that
this
law
cannot
be
enforced
and
its
worst
than
if
there
were
no
such
law
because
the
debasement
of
the
child
is
a
factor
that
is
worst
than
the
literature
that
they
could
read.
i
have
a
great
deal
more
to
argue
but
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
i'll
have
to
rely
upon
my
brief.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
248,
the
last
paragraph
from
the
button
of
that
page.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
the
few
minutes,
as
to
the
question
of
mootness
your
honors
on
the
very
day
that
you
dismissed
those
other
cases,
one
was
the
tannenbaum
case
and
the
--
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
other
one.
this
case
was
granted
review
and
the
year
had
not
passed
under
new
york
law
in
which
there
could
be
execution
under
that
sentence.
so,
well
i'm
not
prepared
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
to
argue
that
case
now.
that
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
no.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
wouldn't
go
along
with
that
because
it's
a
very
same
statute
you
had
in
the
tannenbaum
case
and
in
the
other
case
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
within
the
year.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
but
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
yes,
right.
but
that
wasn't
the
gist
of
the
decision.
the
gist
was
that
there
could
still
have
been
execution
within
the
year's
time
and
while
it
may
--
perhaps
at
this
moment,
i
don't
know.
i
have
to
study
the
point.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
while
at
this
moment,
the
year
might
have
passed
that
the
time
you
granted
review
certainly
at
the
time
when
this
case
was
lodged
in
this
court
though
the
year
have
not
passed.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
wouldn't
accept
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
alright.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
really
have
it
in
the
other
cases
because
the
law
set
forth
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'll
be
happy
to.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
what
else
is
to
be
done?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
at
this
moment,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
your
honor
because
this
is
the
point
i
haven't
even
examined.
all
i
know
is
this
man
has
this
conviction
against
him
and
under
new
york
law
a
second
conviction
would
result
in
more
serious
punishment
to
him.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
but
aside
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
oh,
yes,
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
have
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
you
have
that
in
the
other
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
if
you
look
at
the
record,
let's
say
in
the
mishkin
case
for
example,
you
had
that
situation
where
a
second
conviction
led
to
a
higher
sentence
--
mishkin
have
been
convicted
once
before
the
case,
he
was
in
here
before
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
he
was
(inaudible)
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
he
got
three
years
--
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
the
law
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
you
mean,
whether
it's
compulsory
or
whether
it's
discretionary
to
judge,
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
i'll
be
happy
to
present
that
but
before
i
terminate,
i'd
like
to
point
out
something
that
is
substantive
interest
and
that
is
the
reliance
here
upon
mishkin.
i
don't
think
this
case
has
been
disposed
of
by
mishkin.
first
of
all,
in
mishkin
you
had
a
deviate
class
and
it
was
not
one
of
age.
in
mishkin,
you
have
the
books,
the
court
found
that
the
books
were
directed
toward
this
group
and
there
were
prurient
appeal
to
that
particular
group.
he
have
an
entirely
different
question
of
age,
and
your
honor
was
very
careful
to
point
out
to
avoid
hicklin
being
revived
by
saying
the
following,
“since
our
holding
requires
that
the
recipient
group
be
defined
with
more
specificity
than
in
terms
of
sexually
immature
persons,
it
also
avoid
the
inadequacy
of
the
most
susceptible
person
facet
of
the
hicklin
rule”.
thank
you.
