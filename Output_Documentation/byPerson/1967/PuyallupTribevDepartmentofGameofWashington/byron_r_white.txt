justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
--
in
the
course
of
stating
these
facts,
say
what
rights
the
indians
relinquished?
justice
byron
r.
white
legally,
what
right
did
they
relinquish?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
they
get
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
sources
of
the
rights
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
are
the
treaties,
the
rights
given
them
under
the
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
might
as
well
say
as
like
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
i'm
wrong
in
understanding
here,
this
fish
go
up
the
river
to
spawn?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
conversation
measures
are
designed,
as
i
understand
it,
to
bring
enough
fish
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
that
by
that
time
they
get
up
to
spawning
grounds,
there's
still
enough
left
to
get
job
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there's
some
--
if
the
state
delivered
let's
assume
–
say
the
state
decided
they
had
deliver
a
100
fish
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
in
order
to
have
enough
spawning
fish
up,
when
they
get
up
the
river.
now,
if
the
indians
caught
all
this
100
fish
at
that
point
by
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
spawners
left.
now
if
the
state
decided,
“well,
we
won't
let
the
fishermen
down
below
catch
that
as
many
and
so
we'll
deliver
200
fish
to
the
mouth
of
the
river”.
the
trouble
is
that
the
indians,
isn't
the
claim
anyway
that
the
indians
method
of
fishing
cuts
into
the
spawning
stock
no
matter
how
many
fish
arrive
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
because
you
are
using
net
fishing
continuously
and
steadily
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
100
or
500
fish
milling
around
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
you
would
still
deplete
them,
isn't
that
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
does
that
include
planning
in
commercial
fishermen
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
impact
is,
on
the
spawning
season,
they're
going
up
to
the
river,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
the
other
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
way
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
only
so
if
you
say
if
you
count
all
the
fish
that
are
caught.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whole
puget
sound.
that
isn't
the
percentage
of
how
many
fish
you
take
out
of
the
mouth
of
that
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that's
counting
up
wherever
they're
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
percentage
of
the
fish
that
arrives
at
the
mouth
of
that
river
on
the
way
up
to
spawn,
do
you
take?
we
don't
know,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
it's
a
different
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
fishery
own
by
the
tribe
or
the
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
is
it
owned
by
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
is
the
product
of
the
fishing
owned
by
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
by
individuals
of
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
other
individuals
could
also
form
themselves
and
run
and
start
another
commercial
fishery
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
every
member
of
the
tribe
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
duplicate
the
same
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
these
people
who
--
just
the
indians
who
happen
to
be
engaged
in
this
commercial
fishing
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
indians
could
fish
out
of
the
sound,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
would
happen
if
the
state
limited
the
fishing
in
the
sound,
limited
commercial
fishing
and
sports
fishing
in
the
sound
and
the
result
would
be,
as
you
suggest,
that
more
fish
would
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
would
happen
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
saying
you
--
that
the
indians
retained
their
pre-existing
right
to
fish
and
just
this
treaty
you
have
the
effect
of
letting
the
settlers
fish
with
them,
then
what
do
you
rely
on
to
protect
this
retained
right
to
fish
from
state
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
still
have
to
say
why
that
retains
right
to
fish
is
immune
from
state
regulation?
you
can't
have
a
bull,
you
can't
say
it
was
a
federal
right
guaranteed
by
the
treaty
that's
immune
--
and
therefore
immune
from
state
regulation
and
then
also
say
it
wasn't
a
federal
right
at
all
if
we
always
had
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
inherent?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
treaty
also
includes
a
promise
by
the
united
states
not
to
interfere
with
this
so
called
“retained
right”
or
to
let
the
state
interfere
with
it?
well,
somehow,
you
got
to
keep
the
state
out
of
--
from
regulating
this
right
whatever
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
some
real
dispute
on
the
record
in
this
now
mr.
martin
quite
candidly,
even
if
there
if
there
were
twice
as
many
fish
that
reach
the
mouth
of
that
river,
you
have
no
basis
in
this
record
for
saying
that
the
indians
fishery
would
not
endanger
the
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
even
if
you
regulate
it,
the
commercial
fishing
out
of
the
sound
that
the
indian
fishery
would
have
any
less
impact
on
the
number
of
fish
that
get
up
to
the
stream?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
took
a
hundred
fish
to
get
through
up
the
river
to
maintain
the
run
and
only
one
hundred
fish
were
reaching
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
indians,
by
catching
any
fish,
would
be
destroying
the
run.
but
if
900
or
a
1000
fish
which
they
had
at
the
river,
you
would
be
agreeable
to
say
that
the
indian
right
to
fish
could
be
limited
instead
that
a
100
got
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least,
instead
of
being
able
to
catch
none,
they
could
catch
900?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
washington
is
doing,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
they
--
if
placed
here
out
of
those
nets,
they
have
to
pull
that
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
that
these
fisheries
run
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
tribe
or
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
do,
own
it
and
do
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
indians
could
do
the
same
thing,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
your
case
stand
and
fall
at
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
loss
on
this
and
that
the
court
holds
that
indians
do
have
some
special
right
to
fish
in
these
locations
which
other
citizens
don't
have,
is
the
case
over
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
simply
just
don't
permit
anybody
to
use
nets
in
these
locations?
justice
byron
r.
white
indians
wanted
to
go
out
in
the
bay
and
fish
like
that
with
the
people
they
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
substantial
numbers
of
commercial
fish
taken
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
forbade
all
commercial
fishing
in
puget
sound,
a
great
many
more
fish
would
reach
the
river
as
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
use
nets
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
use
the
figures
we
used
a
while
ago.
assume
that
100
fish
have
to
get
up
to
the
river
to
maintain
the
run
and
if
a
1000
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river,
if
you
permitted
net
fishing
by
day
and
no
net
fishing
by
night
or
vice
versa,
that
a
lot
of
fish
get
through,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
them
go
on
up
in
the
stream
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
stay
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
no
matter
how
many
fish
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river
that
if
you
permit
net
fishing,
you're
going
to
exhaust
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
mean
that
if
you've
got
10
times
as
many
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
get
there
now
that
there
wouldn't
be
some
feasible
way
of
regulating
the
indian
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
order
to
ensure
that
enough
fish
got
through
and
got
up
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
you
said
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
said
to
the
indians
who
were
fishing
there
that
based
on
the
number
of
fish
that
you
find
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
if
you
said
–
your
take
should
be
limited
to
ex-fisher,
ex
pound
and
that's
all.
each
day
or
some
overall
limit
you
could
certainly
find
some
way
of
guaranteeing
that
enough
fish
were
left
to
get
up
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that's
just
impractical?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
that
assumes
--
now
you're
going
back
to
your
first
point
that
indians
don't
have
any
right
at
all
that
--
and
if
the
court
decides
that
the
indians
do
have
some
right
beyond
that
the
ordinary
inhabitant,
then
he
is
not,
he's
not
stealing
$50
or
a
$1000.
he
is
exercising
the
right
he
is
supposed
to
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
this
whole
case
turns
upon
whether
there's
a
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
either
one
way
or
another,
it's
either
one
way
or
all
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
though
that
there
was
this
special
right
the
indians
had
another
or
shared
by
the
other
inhabitants.
you're
suggesting
to
us
that
there's
no
practical
way
even
if
10
times
as
many
fisher
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
as
were
did
it
up
stream.
there's
no
practical
way
of
regulating
indian
fishing
so
as
to
ensure
that
enough
fish
would
go
on
up
and
still
let
the
indians
catch
some
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
work
pretty
well?
you
think
you
get
accurate
reports?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
you
said
you're
going
to
limit
the
indian
fishing
to
'x'
pound,
that
'x'
pound
may
just
happen
to
include
too
many
fish
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
way
of
avoiding
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
the
fish
are
moving?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
everybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
about
the
other
members
of
the
tribe
who
share
this
right,
are
they
making
any
effort
to
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
objecting
only
a
--
is
this
commercial
fishery
just
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
or
is
it
also
up
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
far
up
the
river
do
they
put
up
nets?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it's
not
just
at
the
mouth?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
fish
that
whole
run
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
through
this
water,
fish
just
sometimes
just
milling?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
at
the
mouth?
justice
byron
r.
white
net
fishing,
commercial
fishing
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
were
you
at,
commercial
fishing
on
the
columbia
by
the
run
where
it's
a
fisher
on
the
boat.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
fishing
in
puget
sound
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
i
suppose
you
could
regulate
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
your
position
would
certainly
carry
that
the
reservations
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
treat
this
point
in
you
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
you
going
to
do
that
though
the
other
side
says
that
it's
impractical
to
put
–
to
devise
a
set
of
regulations
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
think
that
permits
a
proper
escapement
when
you're
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
this
indian
--
are
your
clients
the
smallest
commercial
fishermen
in
the
whole
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
a
$125,000
annual
gross,
a
125,000
is
the
smallest
of
those
commercial
fishermen
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
hardly
be
smaller?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
probably
the
medium
size?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
medium
size
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
could
be
some
other
members
of
the
tribe
who
could
exercise
the
tribal
rights
just
like
these
three
and
duplicate
this
whole
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
tribe
hasn't
regulated
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
tribe
hasn't
regulated
this
fishery
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
--
in
the
course
of
stating
these
facts,
say
what
rights
the
indians
relinquished?
justice
byron
r.
white
legally,
what
right
did
they
relinquish?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
they
get
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
sources
of
the
rights
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
are
the
treaties,
the
rights
given
them
under
the
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
might
as
well
say
as
like
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
i'm
wrong
in
understanding
here,
this
fish
go
up
the
river
to
spawn?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
conversation
measures
are
designed,
as
i
understand
it,
to
bring
enough
fish
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
that
by
that
time
they
get
up
to
spawning
grounds,
there's
still
enough
left
to
get
job
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there's
some
--
if
the
state
delivered
let's
assume
–
say
the
state
decided
they
had
deliver
a
100
fish
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
in
order
to
have
enough
spawning
fish
up,
when
they
get
up
the
river.
now,
if
the
indians
caught
all
this
100
fish
at
that
point
by
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
spawners
left.
now
if
the
state
decided,
“well,
we
won't
let
the
fishermen
down
below
catch
that
as
many
and
so
we'll
deliver
200
fish
to
the
mouth
of
the
river”.
the
trouble
is
that
the
indians,
isn't
the
claim
anyway
that
the
indians
method
of
fishing
cuts
into
the
spawning
stock
no
matter
how
many
fish
arrive
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
because
you
are
using
net
fishing
continuously
and
steadily
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
100
or
500
fish
milling
around
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
you
would
still
deplete
them,
isn't
that
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
does
that
include
planning
in
commercial
fishermen
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
impact
is,
on
the
spawning
season,
they're
going
up
to
the
river,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
the
other
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
way
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
only
so
if
you
say
if
you
count
all
the
fish
that
are
caught.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whole
puget
sound.
that
isn't
the
percentage
of
how
many
fish
you
take
out
of
the
mouth
of
that
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that's
counting
up
wherever
they're
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
percentage
of
the
fish
that
arrives
at
the
mouth
of
that
river
on
the
way
up
to
spawn,
do
you
take?
we
don't
know,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
it's
a
different
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
fishery
own
by
the
tribe
or
the
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
is
it
owned
by
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
is
the
product
of
the
fishing
owned
by
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
by
individuals
of
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
other
individuals
could
also
form
themselves
and
run
and
start
another
commercial
fishery
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
every
member
of
the
tribe
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
duplicate
the
same
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
these
people
who
--
just
the
indians
who
happen
to
be
engaged
in
this
commercial
fishing
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
indians
could
fish
out
of
the
sound,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
would
happen
if
the
state
limited
the
fishing
in
the
sound,
limited
commercial
fishing
and
sports
fishing
in
the
sound
and
the
result
would
be,
as
you
suggest,
that
more
fish
would
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
would
happen
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
saying
you
--
that
the
indians
retained
their
pre-existing
right
to
fish
and
just
this
treaty
you
have
the
effect
of
letting
the
settlers
fish
with
them,
then
what
do
you
rely
on
to
protect
this
retained
right
to
fish
from
state
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
still
have
to
say
why
that
retains
right
to
fish
is
immune
from
state
regulation?
you
can't
have
a
bull,
you
can't
say
it
was
a
federal
right
guaranteed
by
the
treaty
that's
immune
--
and
therefore
immune
from
state
regulation
and
then
also
say
it
wasn't
a
federal
right
at
all
if
we
always
had
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
inherent?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
treaty
also
includes
a
promise
by
the
united
states
not
to
interfere
with
this
so
called
“retained
right”
or
to
let
the
state
interfere
with
it?
well,
somehow,
you
got
to
keep
the
state
out
of
--
from
regulating
this
right
whatever
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
some
real
dispute
on
the
record
in
this
now
mr.
martin
quite
candidly,
even
if
there
if
there
were
twice
as
many
fish
that
reach
the
mouth
of
that
river,
you
have
no
basis
in
this
record
for
saying
that
the
indians
fishery
would
not
endanger
the
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
even
if
you
regulate
it,
the
commercial
fishing
out
of
the
sound
that
the
indian
fishery
would
have
any
less
impact
on
the
number
of
fish
that
get
up
to
the
stream?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
took
a
hundred
fish
to
get
through
up
the
river
to
maintain
the
run
and
only
one
hundred
fish
were
reaching
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
indians,
by
catching
any
fish,
would
be
destroying
the
run.
but
if
900
or
a
1000
fish
which
they
had
at
the
river,
you
would
be
agreeable
to
say
that
the
indian
right
to
fish
could
be
limited
instead
that
a
100
got
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least,
instead
of
being
able
to
catch
none,
they
could
catch
900?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
washington
is
doing,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
they
--
if
placed
here
out
of
those
nets,
they
have
to
pull
that
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
that
these
fisheries
run
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
tribe
or
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
do,
own
it
and
do
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
indians
could
do
the
same
thing,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
your
case
stand
and
fall
at
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
loss
on
this
and
that
the
court
holds
that
indians
do
have
some
special
right
to
fish
in
these
locations
which
other
citizens
don't
have,
is
the
case
over
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
simply
just
don't
permit
anybody
to
use
nets
in
these
locations?
justice
byron
r.
white
indians
wanted
to
go
out
in
the
bay
and
fish
like
that
with
the
people
they
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
substantial
numbers
of
commercial
fish
taken
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
forbade
all
commercial
fishing
in
puget
sound,
a
great
many
more
fish
would
reach
the
river
as
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
use
nets
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
use
the
figures
we
used
a
while
ago.
assume
that
100
fish
have
to
get
up
to
the
river
to
maintain
the
run
and
if
a
1000
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river,
if
you
permitted
net
fishing
by
day
and
no
net
fishing
by
night
or
vice
versa,
that
a
lot
of
fish
get
through,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
them
go
on
up
in
the
stream
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
stay
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
no
matter
how
many
fish
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river
that
if
you
permit
net
fishing,
you're
going
to
exhaust
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
mean
that
if
you've
got
10
times
as
many
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
get
there
now
that
there
wouldn't
be
some
feasible
way
of
regulating
the
indian
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
order
to
ensure
that
enough
fish
got
through
and
got
up
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
you
said
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
said
to
the
indians
who
were
fishing
there
that
based
on
the
number
of
fish
that
you
find
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
if
you
said
–
your
take
should
be
limited
to
ex-fisher,
ex
pound
and
that's
all.
each
day
or
some
overall
limit
you
could
certainly
find
some
way
of
guaranteeing
that
enough
fish
were
left
to
get
up
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that's
just
impractical?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
that
assumes
--
now
you're
going
back
to
your
first
point
that
indians
don't
have
any
right
at
all
that
--
and
if
the
court
decides
that
the
indians
do
have
some
right
beyond
that
the
ordinary
inhabitant,
then
he
is
not,
he's
not
stealing
$50
or
a
$1000.
he
is
exercising
the
right
he
is
supposed
to
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
this
whole
case
turns
upon
whether
there's
a
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
either
one
way
or
another,
it's
either
one
way
or
all
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
though
that
there
was
this
special
right
the
indians
had
another
or
shared
by
the
other
inhabitants.
you're
suggesting
to
us
that
there's
no
practical
way
even
if
10
times
as
many
fisher
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
as
were
did
it
up
stream.
there's
no
practical
way
of
regulating
indian
fishing
so
as
to
ensure
that
enough
fish
would
go
on
up
and
still
let
the
indians
catch
some
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
work
pretty
well?
you
think
you
get
accurate
reports?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
you
said
you're
going
to
limit
the
indian
fishing
to
'x'
pound,
that
'x'
pound
may
just
happen
to
include
too
many
fish
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
way
of
avoiding
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
the
fish
are
moving?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
everybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
about
the
other
members
of
the
tribe
who
share
this
right,
are
they
making
any
effort
to
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
objecting
only
a
--
is
this
commercial
fishery
just
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
or
is
it
also
up
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
far
up
the
river
do
they
put
up
nets?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it's
not
just
at
the
mouth?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
fish
that
whole
run
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
through
this
water,
fish
just
sometimes
just
milling?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
at
the
mouth?
justice
byron
r.
white
net
fishing,
commercial
fishing
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
were
you
at,
commercial
fishing
on
the
columbia
by
the
run
where
it's
a
fisher
on
the
boat.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
fishing
in
puget
sound
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
i
suppose
you
could
regulate
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
your
position
would
certainly
carry
that
the
reservations
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
treat
this
point
in
you
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
you
going
to
do
that
though
the
other
side
says
that
it's
impractical
to
put
–
to
devise
a
set
of
regulations
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
think
that
permits
a
proper
escapement
when
you're
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
this
indian
--
are
your
clients
the
smallest
commercial
fishermen
in
the
whole
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
a
$125,000
annual
gross,
a
125,000
is
the
smallest
of
those
commercial
fishermen
in
puget
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
hardly
be
smaller?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
probably
the
medium
size?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
medium
size
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
could
be
some
other
members
of
the
tribe
who
could
exercise
the
tribal
rights
just
like
these
three
and
duplicate
this
whole
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
tribe
hasn't
regulated
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
tribe
hasn't
regulated
this
fishery
as
a
matter
of
fact?
