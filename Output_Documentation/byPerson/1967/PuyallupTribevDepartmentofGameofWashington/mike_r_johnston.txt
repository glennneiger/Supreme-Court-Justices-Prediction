mr.
mike
r.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
can
return
a
minute
to
what
co-counsel
was
discussing,
the
fish
are
not
frangible
items.
they
are
not
at
all
the
same.
even
within
a
single
stream,
the
fish
are
different.
they
are
possessed
of
different
gene
characteristics
and
they
go
to
different
parts
of
the
stream
and
the
difficulty
with
catching
fish
with
a
net
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
fresh
water
is
that
the
fish
mill
around
and
they
stay
there
and
you
fish
over
and
over
again
on
the
same
stocks.
the
same
fish
are
being
fished
today,
tomorrow
or
next
week,
may
be
two
weeks
from
now
depending
on
how
long
they
stay
there.
and
so
what
you
would
effectively
do
is
you
effectively
destroy
a
certain
portion
of
that
run
and
that
portion
that
once
it's
destroyed,
it
may
never
return
again.
in
other
words,
fish
a
may
go
three
miles
upstream,
fish
b
will
go
four
miles
upstream,
fish
c
will
go
five
miles
upstream.
if
you
remove
fish
a,
there
aren't
anymore
fish
a's.
if
you
catch
every
fish
a,
then
effectively
you
destroyed
that
portion
of
the
run.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
you're
always
taking
numbers.
that's
the
reason
for
having
a
resource;
it's
the
utilizing.
and
what
you
try
to
do
--
if
you're
trying
--
the
commercial
fishing
as
regulated
in
such
a
way
--
the
fishing
boat
stays
in
one
place
and
the
fish
goes,
the
fish
swim
by
essentially.
now
if
the
fishing
boat
stays
in
one
place
and
the
fish
are
staying
in
one
place,
everyday
of
scooping
out
the
same
sparks
all
the
time
and
you're
destroying,
effectively
destroying
a
portion
of
the
run.
they
will
never,
probably
never,
come
back.
commercial
fishing
is
allowed
in
puget
sound,
for
example
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
that's
right.
now,
a
stream
can
only
handle
so
many
spawning
fish
in
theory.
you
can
over
spawn
a
stream.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
you
don't
give
it
to
the
commercial
fishermen.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
harvest
it
or
take
it.
let
the
commercial
fishermen
take
it,
that's
right.
we're
sports
fishermen.
take
it.
and
it
makes
no
difference.
this
bloodline
ancestry
is
not
of
any
concern
to
us.
the
problem
is
where
they
catch
the
fish
and
how
they
catch
the
fish.
that's
the
important
thing
i
think
in
this
case.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
and
when
they
catch
the
fish,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record,
i
think
the
testimony
in
this
record
of
the
most
imminent
biologists
that
we
could
find
is
in
uniform
and
they
all
say
that
you
cannot
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
nets
and
the
reason
is
that
you're
fishing
the
same
fish
over
and
over
and
over
again.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
counsel
was
referring,
your
honor,
to
a
program
that's
run
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
department
of
interior
where
they
either
subsidize
or
make
outright
grants
of
monies
to
indians
so
that
they
may
engage
in
commercial
fishery,
a
legal
salt
water
fishery.
in
other
words,
they
--
long
term
loans
for
boats
and
equipment,
a
low
interest
loans
so
the
indians
may
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
the
treaty,
your
honor,
can
be
changed
by
an
act
of
congress
tomorrow.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
without
consent
from
no
one.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
pass
indian
legislation
in
congress,
your
honor.
it's
extremely
difficult.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
in
the
1963,
your
honor,
i
think
senator
magnuson
introduced
to
two
different
resolutions
in
the
senate:
one
saying
that
the
indian
treaty
right
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
a
right
to
be
equal;
and
the
other
said
that
the
united
states
should
purchase
the
indian's
treaty
right
whatever
it
was.
hearings
were
held
before
the
senate
interior
committee
and
that
was
into
the
matter.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
you
mean,
would
we
be
liable
on
damages?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
we
have
an
obligation,
i
would
assume
there
were
law
of
the
land,
your
honor
and
if
the
treaty
right
is
such
that
the
indians
do
have
the
right
to
fish,
we
will
certainly
respect
that
and
we
won't
attempt
to
regulate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
our
position:
that
the
treaty
gave
the
right
to
the
indians.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
we
lose.
our
position
essentially
is
that
the
treaty
gave
the
indians
a
right
to
fish
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
in
1855,
the
indians
had
effectively
had
no
right.
as
a
legal
matter,
they
had
no
right.
there
weren't
citizens.
they
were
just
simply
people
who
had
been
defeated
and
conquered.
the
treaty
was
made
with
them
and
they
gave
them
a
right
to
fish
in
common.
it
was
a
grant
from
the
united
states
to
the
indians,
not
the
other
way
around.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
not
on
reservations,
your
honor.
i
think
reservations
have
a
completely
different
legal
status.
we
make
no
claim
whatever
to
regulate
indian
fishing
on
indian
reservations.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
do
in
the
state
of
washington.
yes,
sir,
quite
extensive
like
–
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
we
do
not
make
any
attempt
to
regulate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
ordinarily,
your
honor,
being
completely
candid,
i
would
say
no.
it's
usually
–
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
i
am
not
so
sure
it's
quite
a
contract,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
puyallup
river
for
example,
it's
more
the
law
of
the
sword.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
more
the
law
of
the
sword,
the
strongest
indians
get
the
best
fishing
places
and
the
weaker
indians
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
we
joined
them
as
defendants,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
because
the
right
to
fish,
if
there
is
such
a
right,
is
a
tribal
right.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
by
individuals,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it's
a
communal
right,
your
honor.
it's
a
communal
right,
but
it
can
only
be
exercised
by
people
acting
individually.
somebody
has
to
go
and
put
the
net
in
the
river
and
each
indian
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
we
kind
of
involved
all
the
indians
in
the
state
of
washington
who
were
fishing
in
what
we
consider
to
be
an
illegal
manner
and
they
were
only,
i
think
approximately
a
174
indians
in
the
whole
state
of
washington,
there
are
fishing
what
we
consider
to
be
illegal.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
if
they
fish
in
a
general
commercial
fishery,
we
don't
even
know
that
they're
indians.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
any
lawful
means.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
a
net
if
they're
fishing
commercially
in
the
puget
sound,
a
hook
and
line
if
they
are
fishing
for
sport.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
they
used
nets
on
reservations
that
when
they
come
outside
the
reservation
and
use
those
means
and
that's
when
we
get
in
the
situation
that
we
are
presently
in.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
we
brought
the
suit
against
the
tribe
because
we
wanted
to
get
the
whole
issue
settled.
if
we
have
sued
a
single
individual,
they
may
well
have
argued
that
we
fail
to
join
in
an
indispensable
party
because
the
right
flows
from
the
united
states
through
the
treaty
to
the
tribe
as
an
entity,
but
it's
exercised
by
the
individual.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
would
say
if
he
can,
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
is
physically
capable
of
doing
that.
now,
some
tribes
cooperate
a
little
better
with
each
other
than
others.
it
would
be
less
unfair
if
i
didn't
say
that
but
when
speak
in
terms
of
a
tribe,
it's
not
a
monolithic
entity
in
the
state.
it's
a
very
loosely
organized
and
loosely
defined
situation.
for
example,
we
don't
know
who
an
indian
is.
we
talked
on
that
some
yesterday.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir,
and
it's
not.
it's
a
fight
merely
bet
--
as
we
look
at
it,
as
we
view
it,
it's
a
fight
merely
between
the
fish
and
someone
who
would
tend
to
destroy
the
runs.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
before
it
was
enjoined
--
in
washington
you
have
a
fish
ticket
system.
when
you
sale
a
fish
commercially,
the
buyer
makes
out
of
ticket.
he
sends
a
copy,
one
copy
of
that
to
the
state
and
that
it
has
the
poundage
and
the
price
paid
per
pound.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
as
long
as
it's
legal
fishery.
in
1963,
the
gross
receipts
that
we
received
from
the
state
were
a
$124,000.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
a
large
operation.
they
had
as
much
gear
in
the
river
as
physically
the
river
could
accommodate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
would
say
it
was
a
fairly
large
operation,
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
was
a
large
commercial
fishing
operation.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
there
were
three
brothers
and
they
would
have
people
working
for
them
of
and
on
tbut
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
sir,
members
of
the
puyallup
tribe,
that's
correct,
that's
our
standing.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
think
that
the
numbers
used
yesterday
were
nine
million
fish
and
818,000
fish
caught
by
the
indians.
i
think
that,
and
perhaps
i'm
not
correct
that
it
was
pounds
instead
of
numbers
of
fish
-
nine
million
pounds
of
fish.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record.
this
is
not
an
equal
case.
there's
nothing
--
there's
not
one;
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
case
on
that.
it
matters
not
who
does
the
fishing;
it's
where,
when
and
how.
we
cannot
as
to
who.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
certainly
can.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
absolutely
not.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that
there
was
alluded
to
yesterday,
justice
black,
by
a
counsel
for
the
united
states.
but
what
we
really
should
do
is
cut
down
the
fishing
in
the
sound
and
let
more
fish
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
river.
well,
it
sounds
nice
but
it
simply
doesn't
work
that
way.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
it's
simply
a
statement.
it
appears
in
their
brief
and
it
appeared
yesterday
in
oral
argument
and
it
simply
a
statement
that
first
plus
sounds
logical,
but
it's
not
biologically
sound.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it's
not
biologically
sound
to
use
nets
in
fresh
water
by
anybody
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
at
any
time,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
it's
not
somewhat,
sir.
that
does
in
fact
happen
but
and
that
also,
the
fishing
in
over
and
over
on
the
same
spawning
stock
and
you
remove
various
portions
of
gene
pools.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
take
the
random
sample
out
of
the
whole
run
as
it
passes
a
certain
point
and
when
the
run
gets
to
the
river
and
the
fish
stop,
and
then
you
keep
fishing
over
and
over
again
on
these
same
fish,
that's
when
you
get
into
your
extreme
difficulty
even
if
you
can
regulate
the
numbers
that
they
take
or
the
pounds
that
they
take.
you
destroy
the
individual
gene
sources
and
the
run
is
destroyed
ultimately.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
only
way
to
avoid
it
would
be
to
fish
out
where
everyone
else
fishes.
in
other
words,
fishing
transportation
what
we
call
“transportation
water”.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
where
the
fish
are
moving,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it
reflects
else
of
a
quality
fish.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
quality
fish,
that's
correct,
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
can
take
their
nets
and
fish
in
a
salt
like
everyone
else.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
only
way
that
they
can
fish
there
is
with
the
hook
and
line
and
a
fishing
pole.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
like
everybody
else.
and
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
these
two
tribes
that
were
dealing
with
are
the
nisqually
and
the
puyallups.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
makah
indians
and
there
may
will
be
others
too,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
are
in
the
northwestern
tip
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
think
it
depends
on
the
tenacity
of
individual,
frankly.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
depending
on
the
river,
it
goes
up
the
river
as
far
as
it's
feasible
for
the
indians
to
catch
fish.
in
other
words,
they
will
catch
them
in
any
place
they
can.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
in
terms
of
miles
under
particular
stream?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
in
the
case
of
the
puyallups,
it
went
up
to
the
time
somewhere,
which
i
would
guess
is
about
ten
miles.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
the
primary
place
to
fish
is
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
--
is
at
the
mouth.
that's
the
best
place
because
get
the
first
crack
of
the
resource.
everybody
behind
you
has
to
take
what's
over
from
your
operation
are
the
fish
that
escaped
your
nets.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
over
the
long
haul,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
the
puget
sound
(voice
overlap).
pardon?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
i
do
not
know
precisely,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
fishing
days
or
in
terms
of
how
it's
taken
but
the
resource
is
dwindling
and
the
reason
that
it's
dwindling
is
because
the
environment
has
slowly
but
surely
being
destroyed.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
oh!
it's
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
the
resource
and
it's
commercial
fishermen
benefit
from
that
and
that's
correct.
but
it's
not
--
it's
in
the
indians
own
interest
themselves.
the
hoko
river
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
happens
when
you
over
fish
a
stream.
in
1952,
they
got
10,000
silver
salmon
in
the
hoko
river.
it's
a
stream
that
runs
through
the
reservation
and
we
have
no
control
over
it
and
then
the
runs
have
gone
down
to
about
3,000
fish
a
year,
that's
their
take.
that
resource
has
effectively
been
destroyed.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir.
well,
there's
not
274
days
of
commercial
fishing
left
anymore.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
because
the
resource
is
dwindling.
the
total
numbers
of
fish
available
are
coming
down.
they're
getting
smaller.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
your
honor,
the
reason
that
the
runs
are
–
they
are
going
down
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it's
the
difference
between
274
days
and
80
days
was
27
years.
in
other
words,
the
fishing
time
was
cut
down
over
a
period
27
years.
here's
another
example
of
what
happens.
this
is
the
yakima
river.
it's
a
river
that
runs
through
an
indian
reservation.
the
indians
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
fish
there
as
much
as
they
like
in
any
matter
and
in
any
means
they'd
care
to
choose.
in
1953,
there
are
approximately
a
catch
of
about
2,000
salmon
and
that
was
in
the
escapement
and
the
escapement
to
spawn
of
about
6,000
salmon.
the
catch
goes
up
and
the
spawning
--
the
numbers
of
fish
available
for
spawning
have
to
decrease.
it
simply
have
to
decrease
because
there
are
only
so
many
fish
in
the
river.
the
more
you
catch,
the
fewer
there
are
to
spawn.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
your
honor,
these
fish
are
already
in
the
river.
they're
there
and
that's
where
did
they
take
it.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
alright,
and
it
does
no
good.
it
does
no
good
to
let
400
fish
get
to
the
river,
if
the
indians
are
going
to
take
all
400
of
them.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
400
or
a
1000.
they're
going
to
take
them
all
if
you
--
ordinarily,
with
that
500
fish
get
to
the
river
and
you
let
a
1000
get
to
the
river
and
the
indians
take
all
a
1000,
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
spawning,
that's
just
as
barren
and
just
as
empty.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
can
return
a
minute
to
what
co-counsel
was
discussing,
the
fish
are
not
frangible
items.
they
are
not
at
all
the
same.
even
within
a
single
stream,
the
fish
are
different.
they
are
possessed
of
different
gene
characteristics
and
they
go
to
different
parts
of
the
stream
and
the
difficulty
with
catching
fish
with
a
net
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
fresh
water
is
that
the
fish
mill
around
and
they
stay
there
and
you
fish
over
and
over
again
on
the
same
stocks.
the
same
fish
are
being
fished
today,
tomorrow
or
next
week,
may
be
two
weeks
from
now
depending
on
how
long
they
stay
there.
and
so
what
you
would
effectively
do
is
you
effectively
destroy
a
certain
portion
of
that
run
and
that
portion
that
once
it's
destroyed,
it
may
never
return
again.
in
other
words,
fish
a
may
go
three
miles
upstream,
fish
b
will
go
four
miles
upstream,
fish
c
will
go
five
miles
upstream.
if
you
remove
fish
a,
there
aren't
anymore
fish
a's.
if
you
catch
every
fish
a,
then
effectively
you
destroyed
that
portion
of
the
run.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
you're
always
taking
numbers.
that's
the
reason
for
having
a
resource;
it's
the
utilizing.
and
what
you
try
to
do
--
if
you're
trying
--
the
commercial
fishing
as
regulated
in
such
a
way
--
the
fishing
boat
stays
in
one
place
and
the
fish
goes,
the
fish
swim
by
essentially.
now
if
the
fishing
boat
stays
in
one
place
and
the
fish
are
staying
in
one
place,
everyday
of
scooping
out
the
same
sparks
all
the
time
and
you're
destroying,
effectively
destroying
a
portion
of
the
run.
they
will
never,
probably
never,
come
back.
commercial
fishing
is
allowed
in
puget
sound,
for
example
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
that's
right.
now,
a
stream
can
only
handle
so
many
spawning
fish
in
theory.
you
can
over
spawn
a
stream.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
you
don't
give
it
to
the
commercial
fishermen.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
harvest
it
or
take
it.
let
the
commercial
fishermen
take
it,
that's
right.
we're
sports
fishermen.
take
it.
and
it
makes
no
difference.
this
bloodline
ancestry
is
not
of
any
concern
to
us.
the
problem
is
where
they
catch
the
fish
and
how
they
catch
the
fish.
that's
the
important
thing
i
think
in
this
case.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
and
when
they
catch
the
fish,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record,
i
think
the
testimony
in
this
record
of
the
most
imminent
biologists
that
we
could
find
is
in
uniform
and
they
all
say
that
you
cannot
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
nets
and
the
reason
is
that
you're
fishing
the
same
fish
over
and
over
and
over
again.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
counsel
was
referring,
your
honor,
to
a
program
that's
run
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
department
of
interior
where
they
either
subsidize
or
make
outright
grants
of
monies
to
indians
so
that
they
may
engage
in
commercial
fishery,
a
legal
salt
water
fishery.
in
other
words,
they
--
long
term
loans
for
boats
and
equipment,
a
low
interest
loans
so
the
indians
may
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
the
treaty,
your
honor,
can
be
changed
by
an
act
of
congress
tomorrow.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
without
consent
from
no
one.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
pass
indian
legislation
in
congress,
your
honor.
it's
extremely
difficult.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
in
the
1963,
your
honor,
i
think
senator
magnuson
introduced
to
two
different
resolutions
in
the
senate:
one
saying
that
the
indian
treaty
right
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
a
right
to
be
equal;
and
the
other
said
that
the
united
states
should
purchase
the
indian's
treaty
right
whatever
it
was.
hearings
were
held
before
the
senate
interior
committee
and
that
was
into
the
matter.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
you
mean,
would
we
be
liable
on
damages?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
we
have
an
obligation,
i
would
assume
there
were
law
of
the
land,
your
honor
and
if
the
treaty
right
is
such
that
the
indians
do
have
the
right
to
fish,
we
will
certainly
respect
that
and
we
won't
attempt
to
regulate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
our
position:
that
the
treaty
gave
the
right
to
the
indians.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
we
lose.
our
position
essentially
is
that
the
treaty
gave
the
indians
a
right
to
fish
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
in
1855,
the
indians
had
effectively
had
no
right.
as
a
legal
matter,
they
had
no
right.
there
weren't
citizens.
they
were
just
simply
people
who
had
been
defeated
and
conquered.
the
treaty
was
made
with
them
and
they
gave
them
a
right
to
fish
in
common.
it
was
a
grant
from
the
united
states
to
the
indians,
not
the
other
way
around.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
not
on
reservations,
your
honor.
i
think
reservations
have
a
completely
different
legal
status.
we
make
no
claim
whatever
to
regulate
indian
fishing
on
indian
reservations.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
do
in
the
state
of
washington.
yes,
sir,
quite
extensive
like
–
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
we
do
not
make
any
attempt
to
regulate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
ordinarily,
your
honor,
being
completely
candid,
i
would
say
no.
it's
usually
–
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
i
am
not
so
sure
it's
quite
a
contract,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
puyallup
river
for
example,
it's
more
the
law
of
the
sword.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
more
the
law
of
the
sword,
the
strongest
indians
get
the
best
fishing
places
and
the
weaker
indians
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
we
joined
them
as
defendants,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
because
the
right
to
fish,
if
there
is
such
a
right,
is
a
tribal
right.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
by
individuals,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it's
a
communal
right,
your
honor.
it's
a
communal
right,
but
it
can
only
be
exercised
by
people
acting
individually.
somebody
has
to
go
and
put
the
net
in
the
river
and
each
indian
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
we
kind
of
involved
all
the
indians
in
the
state
of
washington
who
were
fishing
in
what
we
consider
to
be
an
illegal
manner
and
they
were
only,
i
think
approximately
a
174
indians
in
the
whole
state
of
washington,
there
are
fishing
what
we
consider
to
be
illegal.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
if
they
fish
in
a
general
commercial
fishery,
we
don't
even
know
that
they're
indians.
in
other
words
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
any
lawful
means.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
a
net
if
they're
fishing
commercially
in
the
puget
sound,
a
hook
and
line
if
they
are
fishing
for
sport.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
they
used
nets
on
reservations
that
when
they
come
outside
the
reservation
and
use
those
means
and
that's
when
we
get
in
the
situation
that
we
are
presently
in.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
well,
we
brought
the
suit
against
the
tribe
because
we
wanted
to
get
the
whole
issue
settled.
if
we
have
sued
a
single
individual,
they
may
well
have
argued
that
we
fail
to
join
in
an
indispensable
party
because
the
right
flows
from
the
united
states
through
the
treaty
to
the
tribe
as
an
entity,
but
it's
exercised
by
the
individual.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
would
say
if
he
can,
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
is
physically
capable
of
doing
that.
now,
some
tribes
cooperate
a
little
better
with
each
other
than
others.
it
would
be
less
unfair
if
i
didn't
say
that
but
when
speak
in
terms
of
a
tribe,
it's
not
a
monolithic
entity
in
the
state.
it's
a
very
loosely
organized
and
loosely
defined
situation.
for
example,
we
don't
know
who
an
indian
is.
we
talked
on
that
some
yesterday.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir,
and
it's
not.
it's
a
fight
merely
bet
--
as
we
look
at
it,
as
we
view
it,
it's
a
fight
merely
between
the
fish
and
someone
who
would
tend
to
destroy
the
runs.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
before
it
was
enjoined
--
in
washington
you
have
a
fish
ticket
system.
when
you
sale
a
fish
commercially,
the
buyer
makes
out
of
ticket.
he
sends
a
copy,
one
copy
of
that
to
the
state
and
that
it
has
the
poundage
and
the
price
paid
per
pound.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
as
long
as
it's
legal
fishery.
in
1963,
the
gross
receipts
that
we
received
from
the
state
were
a
$124,000.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
a
large
operation.
they
had
as
much
gear
in
the
river
as
physically
the
river
could
accommodate.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
would
say
it
was
a
fairly
large
operation,
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
was
a
large
commercial
fishing
operation.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
there
were
three
brothers
and
they
would
have
people
working
for
them
of
and
on
tbut
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
yes,
sir,
members
of
the
puyallup
tribe,
that's
correct,
that's
our
standing.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
think
that
the
numbers
used
yesterday
were
nine
million
fish
and
818,000
fish
caught
by
the
indians.
i
think
that,
and
perhaps
i'm
not
correct
that
it
was
pounds
instead
of
numbers
of
fish
-
nine
million
pounds
of
fish.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record.
this
is
not
an
equal
case.
there's
nothing
--
there's
not
one;
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
case
on
that.
it
matters
not
who
does
the
fishing;
it's
where,
when
and
how.
we
cannot
as
to
who.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
certainly
can.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
absolutely
not.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that
there
was
alluded
to
yesterday,
justice
black,
by
a
counsel
for
the
united
states.
but
what
we
really
should
do
is
cut
down
the
fishing
in
the
sound
and
let
more
fish
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
river.
well,
it
sounds
nice
but
it
simply
doesn't
work
that
way.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
it's
simply
a
statement.
it
appears
in
their
brief
and
it
appeared
yesterday
in
oral
argument
and
it
simply
a
statement
that
first
plus
sounds
logical,
but
it's
not
biologically
sound.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it's
not
biologically
sound
to
use
nets
in
fresh
water
by
anybody
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
at
any
time,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
it's
not
somewhat,
sir.
that
does
in
fact
happen
but
and
that
also,
the
fishing
in
over
and
over
on
the
same
spawning
stock
and
you
remove
various
portions
of
gene
pools.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
take
the
random
sample
out
of
the
whole
run
as
it
passes
a
certain
point
and
when
the
run
gets
to
the
river
and
the
fish
stop,
and
then
you
keep
fishing
over
and
over
again
on
these
same
fish,
that's
when
you
get
into
your
extreme
difficulty
even
if
you
can
regulate
the
numbers
that
they
take
or
the
pounds
that
they
take.
you
destroy
the
individual
gene
sources
and
the
run
is
destroyed
ultimately.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
only
way
to
avoid
it
would
be
to
fish
out
where
everyone
else
fishes.
in
other
words,
fishing
transportation
what
we
call
“transportation
water”.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
where
the
fish
are
moving,
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
it
reflects
else
of
a
quality
fish.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
quality
fish,
that's
correct,
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
can
take
their
nets
and
fish
in
a
salt
like
everyone
else.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
only
way
that
they
can
fish
there
is
with
the
hook
and
line
and
a
fishing
pole.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
like
everybody
else.
and
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
these
two
tribes
that
were
dealing
with
are
the
nisqually
and
the
puyallups.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
the
makah
indians
and
there
may
will
be
others
too,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
they
are
in
the
northwestern
tip
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
i
think
it
depends
on
the
tenacity
of
individual,
frankly.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
depending
on
the
river,
it
goes
up
the
river
as
far
as
it's
feasible
for
the
indians
to
catch
fish.
in
other
words,
they
will
catch
them
in
any
place
they
can.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
in
terms
of
miles
under
particular
stream?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
in
the
case
of
the
puyallups,
it
went
up
to
the
time
somewhere,
which
i
would
guess
is
about
ten
miles.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
the
primary
place
to
fish
is
--
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
--
is
at
the
mouth.
that's
the
best
place
because
get
the
first
crack
of
the
resource.
everybody
behind
you
has
to
take
what's
over
from
your
operation
are
the
fish
that
escaped
your
nets.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
over
the
long
haul,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
in
the
puget
sound
(voice
overlap).
pardon?
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
i
do
not
know
precisely,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
fishing
days
or
in
terms
of
how
it's
taken
but
the
resource
is
dwindling
and
the
reason
that
it's
dwindling
is
because
the
environment
has
slowly
but
surely
being
destroyed.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
oh!
it's
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
the
resource
and
it's
commercial
fishermen
benefit
from
that
and
that's
correct.
but
it's
not
--
it's
in
the
indians
own
interest
themselves.
the
hoko
river
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
happens
when
you
over
fish
a
stream.
in
1952,
they
got
10,000
silver
salmon
in
the
hoko
river.
it's
a
stream
that
runs
through
the
reservation
and
we
have
no
control
over
it
and
then
the
runs
have
gone
down
to
about
3,000
fish
a
year,
that's
their
take.
that
resource
has
effectively
been
destroyed.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
no,
sir.
well,
there's
not
274
days
of
commercial
fishing
left
anymore.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
because
the
resource
is
dwindling.
the
total
numbers
of
fish
available
are
coming
down.
they're
getting
smaller.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
your
honor,
the
reason
that
the
runs
are
–
they
are
going
down
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it's
the
difference
between
274
days
and
80
days
was
27
years.
in
other
words,
the
fishing
time
was
cut
down
over
a
period
27
years.
here's
another
example
of
what
happens.
this
is
the
yakima
river.
it's
a
river
that
runs
through
an
indian
reservation.
the
indians
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
fish
there
as
much
as
they
like
in
any
matter
and
in
any
means
they'd
care
to
choose.
in
1953,
there
are
approximately
a
catch
of
about
2,000
salmon
and
that
was
in
the
escapement
and
the
escapement
to
spawn
of
about
6,000
salmon.
the
catch
goes
up
and
the
spawning
--
the
numbers
of
fish
available
for
spawning
have
to
decrease.
it
simply
have
to
decrease
because
there
are
only
so
many
fish
in
the
river.
the
more
you
catch,
the
fewer
there
are
to
spawn.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
your
honor,
these
fish
are
already
in
the
river.
they're
there
and
that's
where
did
they
take
it.
mr.
mike
r.
johnston
alright,
and
it
does
no
good.
it
does
no
good
to
let
400
fish
get
to
the
river,
if
the
indians
are
going
to
take
all
400
of
them.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
400
or
a
1000.
they're
going
to
take
them
all
if
you
--
ordinarily,
with
that
500
fish
get
to
the
river
and
you
let
a
1000
get
to
the
river
and
the
indians
take
all
a
1000,
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
spawning,
that's
just
as
barren
and
just
as
empty.
