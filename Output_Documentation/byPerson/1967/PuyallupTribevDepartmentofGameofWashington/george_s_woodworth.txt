mr.
george
s.
woodworth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
of
the
interest
of
oregon
in
this
litigation
because
oregon
shares
with
washington
a
community
of
interest,
which
is
particularly
referred
to
the
area
of
the
columbia
river
drainage.
the
columbia
river
runs
between
oregon
and
washington
and
by
virtue
of
congressional
approval
of
a
compact
between
the
states,
oregon
and
washington
jointly
managed
the
columbia
river,
fishing
on
the
columbia
river.
now,
the
columbia
river
is
different
from
the
puyallup
river
or
the
rivers
in
most
of
western
washington
because
the
columbia
river
is
the
highway
by
which
the
fish
reach
the
up
river
streams.
so
we
have
a
little
different
problem
in
the
columbia
river
that
is
indicated
in
the
rivers
of
western
washington.
in
that
river,
there
have
been
built
a
great
number
of
dams.
it
started
in
1941
with
the
completion
of
grand
coulee
dam.
grand
coulee
dam
wiped
out
1100
miles
of
salmon
spawning
streams.
since
that
time
there
have
been
five
dams
built
below
coulee,
each
of
which
has
had
its
impact
on
the
--
not
only
on
the
ability
of
the
fish
to
spawn,
but
on
the
ability
of
the
fish
to
reach
their
spawning
beds.
and
it's
for
this
reason
because
that
--
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
have
used
their
staffs
of
experts
in
the
fisheries
to
attempt
to
determine
how
many
fish
must
pass
up
the
river
in
order
to
preserve
the
runs.
i
think
it's
been
spoken
up
here
that
in
1911,
50
million
pounds
of
fish
were
harvested
out
of
the
columbia
river.
that
was
in
1911.
since
and
the
last
figure
we
have
was
for
1967
when
9
million
pounds
were
harvested
and
1967
was
one
of
the
best
years
we've
had
in
the
columbia
river
in
recent
years.
in
--
part
of
this
period,
when
we've
kept
records,
we've
kept
the
record
of
the
indian
catch
because
they
report
it
to
the
selling
agencies.
in
1959,
the
indians
on
the
columbia
river
caught
39
thousand
pounds
of
salmon.
in
1967,
when
we
think
there
were
probably
not
more
than
75
or
may
be
80
indians
fishing,
they
caught
1,300,000
pounds
of
fish.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
two
agency's
activities
on
the
columbia
river
has
been
to
enable
enough
fish
to
get
upstream,
to
keep
an
even
balance
if
we
could
just
keep
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
the
non-indian
catch
has
been
materially
reduced.
it's
been
reduced
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
none,
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
the
point
i
make
is
that
conservation
and
regulation
of
fishing
is
necessary
and
the
indians
ought
to
be
included
in
that
regulation
because
it's
a
matter
of
concern
for
all
of
the
people
of
the
community;
that
enough
fish
be
permitted
to
reach
the
spawning
ground.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
indians
are
catching
more
fish
because
the
state
of
oregon
has
been
enjoined
by
the
federal
court
from
interfering
with
the
indian
fishing.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
fishing
in
an
area,
part
of
their
fishing
was
in
an
area
close
to
non-indian
fishing.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
would
say
that
--
no,
i
wouldn't
try
to
answer.
i'd
had
to
guess,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of
fishing
stations
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
think
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon,
your
honor,
that
the
indian
fishery
should
be
subject
to
some
modicum
of
regulation
in
those
areas
where
the
fish
are
most
vulnerable.
as
mr.
coniff
and
mr.
johnston
have
pointed
out,
when
the
fish
reach
the
streams
in
which
they
propagate,
they're
most
vulnerable.
they
can
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
oregon
tried
to
make
an
arrangement
with
the
indians
a
few
years
ago
and
had
an
arrangement
that
worked
for
several
years.
however,
in
the
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
warm
springs
in
the
yakimas,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
the
umitillas
and
to
an
extent
the
nez
perce
participated
in
it,
although
they
went
--
and
this
was
not
a
separate
treaty.
this
was
worked
out
through
the
biologists
of
our
state
and
the
interested
people
in
the
indian
groups.
then,
a
few
years
ago,
as
the
fishing
became
harder,
some
of
the
indian
groups,
with
group
from
the
organization,
the
warm
springs
pattern
their
fishing
programs
after
state
regulation.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
no.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
our
only
right,
as
we
see
it,
is
to
perform
some
of
regulating
duties
outside
the
reservations,
the
off
reservation
fishery.
and
clearly,
i
think
under
the
treaty,
reservation
fishing
is
not
under
any
restriction
by
the
state.
it's
up
to
the
tribes.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
worried
here
more
or
less
that
the
leave
of
the
state
of
washington
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
anything
that
would
undermine
their
position
in
this
case.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i'm
here
to
inform
that
court
to
that
extent
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
your
honor,
i
think
it's
my
position
and
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
that
the
treaty
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
fish
at
certain
stations
in
the
river
and
this
right
cannot
be
denied
them.
to
what
extent
the
indians
may
fish
at
this
usual
and
accustomed
places?
we
feel
it's
a
matter
which
this
court
has
passed
on
a
number
of
times
before
that
it's
a
matter
in
which
the
states
have
the
right
to
regulate.
up
to
this
time,
the
court
has
only
said
in
number
of
cases
and
i'm
referring
now
to
ward
versus
race
horse,
kennedy
versus
becker,
tulee
against
washington
and
the
village
of
cake
versus
eigen.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
court
has
said
that
the
treaty
rights
of
the
indians
as
to
their
off
reservation
activities
are
still
subject
to
state
regulation.
now,
we're
faced
with
the
questions
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
treaty
rights
guaranteeing
to
the
indians
places
in
the
case
of
the
northwest
treaties
the
right
to
fish
and
hunt,
the
right
to
fish
principally
we
we're
talking
about
here
at
a
usual
and
accustomed
place,
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory
and
the
minutes
of
the
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
tulee's
decision
out
of
this
court
which
said
that
indians
couldn't
be
required
to
have
a
fishing
license.
in
the
state
of
oregon,
i
think
it's
been
adopted
by
the
state
of
washington
as
indicating
that
they
don't
have
to
have
a
hunting
license.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
our
local
federal
court
has
said
they
can.
we're
enjoined
from
enforcing
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
against
them
and
i
think
the
answer
is
they
do.
but
hunting
doesn't
cut
down
the
resource
as
unlimited
fishing
is
apt
to
do
and
it's
with
the
fishing
industry
that
we're
principally
concerned
and
we
don't
want
to
and
we're
not
making
a
case
for
the
commercial
fishermen.
the
commercial
fishermen
have
already
been
inhibited.
commercial
seasons
are
set
on
the
columbia
river
for
different
runs
and
generally
they
are
by
days.
as
an
example,
in
the
summers
of
1965,
well
in
the
whole
year,
1965,
1966
and
1967,
all
commercial
and
sports
fishing
for
the
summer
chinook
was
closed
on
the
columbia
river.
there
was
none.
no
sportsmen
talk
this
rod
out,
no
commercial
fishermen
took
his
gear
out,
but
the
indians
caught
10,000
chinook
salmons
that
summer.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
if
there's
to
be
an
indian
fishery,
there
will
be
a
season
for
it
and
it
will
be
set
to
accommodate
the
run
as
it
moves
up
the
200
miles
of
the
river.
it
goes
in
certain
stages
and
so
the
run
is
set
at
the
mouth,
the
season
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
is
the
first
of
the
month.
the
season
40
miles
up
the
river
is
the
fifth
of
the
month
and
it
progresses
at
the
river.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
he's
talking
about
the
rivers
in
which
the
salmon
finally
go
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came
and
repropagate
themselves.
this
is
not
true
at
the
columbia
river.
the
columbia
river
is
the
freeway
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
it
is
of
the
tributary
and
the
tributaries
are
generally
closed.
and
that
is
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
for
the
whole
year.
in
other
words,
deschutes
river
and
lake
river
in
that
part
-
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
closed
to
net
fishing
completely.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
we're
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
it's
fishing
in
puget
sound.
and
when
they
get
to
the
deschutes
river
or
whatever
river
up,
then
they
reached
the
comparable
stage
to
the
puyallup
or
the
nisqually
river.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
of
the
interest
of
oregon
in
this
litigation
because
oregon
shares
with
washington
a
community
of
interest,
which
is
particularly
referred
to
the
area
of
the
columbia
river
drainage.
the
columbia
river
runs
between
oregon
and
washington
and
by
virtue
of
congressional
approval
of
a
compact
between
the
states,
oregon
and
washington
jointly
managed
the
columbia
river,
fishing
on
the
columbia
river.
now,
the
columbia
river
is
different
from
the
puyallup
river
or
the
rivers
in
most
of
western
washington
because
the
columbia
river
is
the
highway
by
which
the
fish
reach
the
up
river
streams.
so
we
have
a
little
different
problem
in
the
columbia
river
that
is
indicated
in
the
rivers
of
western
washington.
in
that
river,
there
have
been
built
a
great
number
of
dams.
it
started
in
1941
with
the
completion
of
grand
coulee
dam.
grand
coulee
dam
wiped
out
1100
miles
of
salmon
spawning
streams.
since
that
time
there
have
been
five
dams
built
below
coulee,
each
of
which
has
had
its
impact
on
the
--
not
only
on
the
ability
of
the
fish
to
spawn,
but
on
the
ability
of
the
fish
to
reach
their
spawning
beds.
and
it's
for
this
reason
because
that
--
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
have
used
their
staffs
of
experts
in
the
fisheries
to
attempt
to
determine
how
many
fish
must
pass
up
the
river
in
order
to
preserve
the
runs.
i
think
it's
been
spoken
up
here
that
in
1911,
50
million
pounds
of
fish
were
harvested
out
of
the
columbia
river.
that
was
in
1911.
since
and
the
last
figure
we
have
was
for
1967
when
9
million
pounds
were
harvested
and
1967
was
one
of
the
best
years
we've
had
in
the
columbia
river
in
recent
years.
in
--
part
of
this
period,
when
we've
kept
records,
we've
kept
the
record
of
the
indian
catch
because
they
report
it
to
the
selling
agencies.
in
1959,
the
indians
on
the
columbia
river
caught
39
thousand
pounds
of
salmon.
in
1967,
when
we
think
there
were
probably
not
more
than
75
or
may
be
80
indians
fishing,
they
caught
1,300,000
pounds
of
fish.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
two
agency's
activities
on
the
columbia
river
has
been
to
enable
enough
fish
to
get
upstream,
to
keep
an
even
balance
if
we
could
just
keep
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
the
non-indian
catch
has
been
materially
reduced.
it's
been
reduced
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
none,
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
the
point
i
make
is
that
conservation
and
regulation
of
fishing
is
necessary
and
the
indians
ought
to
be
included
in
that
regulation
because
it's
a
matter
of
concern
for
all
of
the
people
of
the
community;
that
enough
fish
be
permitted
to
reach
the
spawning
ground.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
indians
are
catching
more
fish
because
the
state
of
oregon
has
been
enjoined
by
the
federal
court
from
interfering
with
the
indian
fishing.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
fishing
in
an
area,
part
of
their
fishing
was
in
an
area
close
to
non-indian
fishing.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
would
say
that
--
no,
i
wouldn't
try
to
answer.
i'd
had
to
guess,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of
fishing
stations
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
think
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon,
your
honor,
that
the
indian
fishery
should
be
subject
to
some
modicum
of
regulation
in
those
areas
where
the
fish
are
most
vulnerable.
as
mr.
coniff
and
mr.
johnston
have
pointed
out,
when
the
fish
reach
the
streams
in
which
they
propagate,
they're
most
vulnerable.
they
can
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
oregon
tried
to
make
an
arrangement
with
the
indians
a
few
years
ago
and
had
an
arrangement
that
worked
for
several
years.
however,
in
the
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
warm
springs
in
the
yakimas,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
the
umitillas
and
to
an
extent
the
nez
perce
participated
in
it,
although
they
went
--
and
this
was
not
a
separate
treaty.
this
was
worked
out
through
the
biologists
of
our
state
and
the
interested
people
in
the
indian
groups.
then,
a
few
years
ago,
as
the
fishing
became
harder,
some
of
the
indian
groups,
with
group
from
the
organization,
the
warm
springs
pattern
their
fishing
programs
after
state
regulation.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
no.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
our
only
right,
as
we
see
it,
is
to
perform
some
of
regulating
duties
outside
the
reservations,
the
off
reservation
fishery.
and
clearly,
i
think
under
the
treaty,
reservation
fishing
is
not
under
any
restriction
by
the
state.
it's
up
to
the
tribes.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
worried
here
more
or
less
that
the
leave
of
the
state
of
washington
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
anything
that
would
undermine
their
position
in
this
case.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i'm
here
to
inform
that
court
to
that
extent
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
your
honor,
i
think
it's
my
position
and
the
position
of
the
state
of
oregon
that
the
treaty
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
fish
at
certain
stations
in
the
river
and
this
right
cannot
be
denied
them.
to
what
extent
the
indians
may
fish
at
this
usual
and
accustomed
places?
we
feel
it's
a
matter
which
this
court
has
passed
on
a
number
of
times
before
that
it's
a
matter
in
which
the
states
have
the
right
to
regulate.
up
to
this
time,
the
court
has
only
said
in
number
of
cases
and
i'm
referring
now
to
ward
versus
race
horse,
kennedy
versus
becker,
tulee
against
washington
and
the
village
of
cake
versus
eigen.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
court
has
said
that
the
treaty
rights
of
the
indians
as
to
their
off
reservation
activities
are
still
subject
to
state
regulation.
now,
we're
faced
with
the
questions
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
treaty
rights
guaranteeing
to
the
indians
places
in
the
case
of
the
northwest
treaties
the
right
to
fish
and
hunt,
the
right
to
fish
principally
we
we're
talking
about
here
at
a
usual
and
accustomed
place,
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory
and
the
minutes
of
the
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
tulee's
decision
out
of
this
court
which
said
that
indians
couldn't
be
required
to
have
a
fishing
license.
in
the
state
of
oregon,
i
think
it's
been
adopted
by
the
state
of
washington
as
indicating
that
they
don't
have
to
have
a
hunting
license.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
our
local
federal
court
has
said
they
can.
we're
enjoined
from
enforcing
our
hunting
and
fishing
laws
against
them
and
i
think
the
answer
is
they
do.
but
hunting
doesn't
cut
down
the
resource
as
unlimited
fishing
is
apt
to
do
and
it's
with
the
fishing
industry
that
we're
principally
concerned
and
we
don't
want
to
and
we're
not
making
a
case
for
the
commercial
fishermen.
the
commercial
fishermen
have
already
been
inhibited.
commercial
seasons
are
set
on
the
columbia
river
for
different
runs
and
generally
they
are
by
days.
as
an
example,
in
the
summers
of
1965,
well
in
the
whole
year,
1965,
1966
and
1967,
all
commercial
and
sports
fishing
for
the
summer
chinook
was
closed
on
the
columbia
river.
there
was
none.
no
sportsmen
talk
this
rod
out,
no
commercial
fishermen
took
his
gear
out,
but
the
indians
caught
10,000
chinook
salmons
that
summer.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
if
there's
to
be
an
indian
fishery,
there
will
be
a
season
for
it
and
it
will
be
set
to
accommodate
the
run
as
it
moves
up
the
200
miles
of
the
river.
it
goes
in
certain
stages
and
so
the
run
is
set
at
the
mouth,
the
season
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
is
the
first
of
the
month.
the
season
40
miles
up
the
river
is
the
fifth
of
the
month
and
it
progresses
at
the
river.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
he's
talking
about
the
rivers
in
which
the
salmon
finally
go
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came
and
repropagate
themselves.
this
is
not
true
at
the
columbia
river.
the
columbia
river
is
the
freeway
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
it
is
of
the
tributary
and
the
tributaries
are
generally
closed.
and
that
is
--
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
for
the
whole
year.
in
other
words,
deschutes
river
and
lake
river
in
that
part
-
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
closed
to
net
fishing
completely.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
we're
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
s.
woodworth
it's
fishing
in
puget
sound.
and
when
they
get
to
the
deschutes
river
or
whatever
river
up,
then
they
reached
the
comparable
stage
to
the
puyallup
or
the
nisqually
river.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
