justice
william
o.
douglas
to
what
extent
that
the
indians
made
this
a
commercial
undertaking?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
talking
about
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
they
have
trucks
that
transport
the
ships,
at
these
fish
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
hauled
to
the
markets?
justice
william
o.
douglas
nevertheless,
they're
put
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
aren't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
they
put
them
in
that
all
seasons
of
the
year?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and,
of
course,
the
net
is
not
designed
to
catch
just
a
salmon,
it
catches
a
fish.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
these
nets,
when
they're
pulling,
contain
everything
that
comes
from
the
ocean
though?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
that
was
before
refrigeration
and
before
the
truck
and
the
automobile
in
these
tremendous
cargoes
wheel
down
those
highways?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
argue
that
the
state
couldn't
bar
you
from
using
any
net
at
all
on
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
isn't
the
only
legislation
here
are
regulations
that
were
stricken
was
the
--
i
mean,
that
was
sustained
was
the
regulation
of
prohibiting
the
use
of
nets?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
can
fish
so
they
control,
they
can
catch,
they
can
bait
fish
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
lot
of
people
catch
fish
without
nets,
i
know.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
would
agree
to
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
who
is
your
client?
justice
william
o.
douglas
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what's
the
definition
of
an
indian
by
the
way?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
member
of
the
yakima
tribe,
you
are
indian
if
you
have
a
164th.
justice
william
o.
douglas
164th.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
a
lot
of
blue-eyed
blonds
in
the
yakima
tribe.
[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
you
could
start
on
the
premise
that
you
have
a
property
right
[inaudible]
or
rembrant
or
chair
you
can
destroy
if
you
wanted,
correct?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
right
to
fish
with
nets?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
some
of
those,
as
i
remember,
some
of
those
don't
have
don't
have
this
phrase,
“in
common
with
other
citizens?”
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
true
what
you
have
just
said
about
the
coast
indians,
the
puyallup,
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
their
treaties?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
can
find
out
now,
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
certainly,
the
folklore
in
that
part
of
the
country
is
that
many
a
sports
fishermen
would
have
come
home
empty
handed
if
they
haven't
been
able
to
buy
this
fish
from
an
indian.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
do
with
the
words,
“in
common
with”?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
put
a
net
across
the
mouth
of
the
river
too?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
they
--
are
they
on
with
the
same
parity
with
the
indians
in
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
challenging
a
net
regulation
of
the
state
of
washington?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
what
do
you
do
with
“in
common
with”?
justice
william
o.
douglas
apart
from
forgetting
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
treaty
doesn't
govern
or
specify
the
method
of
fishing,
does
it,
just
the
place?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
we
had
a
treaty
saying
the
nice
things
promises
from
1854
on
it
to
eternity,
then
you
should
be
unable
to
fish
at
least
accustomed
place
with
the
net
and
we'd
have
[inaudible]
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
silalo
indian
case
and
river.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
isn't
the
most
of
the
commercial
fishery
--
the
fisheries,
aren't
they
located
out
in
the
ocean?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
where
is
the
bulk
of
the
commercial
fishing,
is
it
in
the
ocean?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
you
could
do
it
theoretically
get
enough
game
wardens
on
night
and
day
on
every
stream?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
does
the
steelhead
season?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
when
does
the
steelhead
come
in
to
spawn?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
running
right
now,
aren't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
salmon
come
in,
some
come
in
in
may?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
know
when
the
jack
salmon
run?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
run
at
various
periods,
don't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
should
began
in
the
big
arguments.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
didn't
you
talk
about
the
warm
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
talked
about
fishing
on
the
reservations
or
off?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
indian
in
oregon
need
a
hunting
license
to
hunt
off
the
reservation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
can
the
indian
hunter
kill
dear
out
of
season
off
the
reservation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
you
leave
us
supplemental
memoranda
for
us?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
see
the
problem
is
not
whether
they
can
--
the
state
can
interfere
with
the
treaty
right,
i
would
assume
that
it
certainly
could
not.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
treaty
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
that
assumes
of
what
the
treaty
right
is,
is
the
right
to
fish
with
the
net
at
the
mouth
of
this
river.
and
you
haven't
yet
explained
to
me,
to
my
satisfaction,
may
be
i
missed
it,
where
you
find
in
the
treaty
the
words
“with
nets”.
it
says,
“at
their
custom
places
in
common
with”.
that
doesn't
use
the
word
“nets”,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
let's
speak
of
the
treaty.
the
treaty
doesn't
--
this
provision
doesn't
say
at
their
accustomed
places
with
their
accustomed
way
of
doing
it,
do
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
still
standard
today
and
they
could
catch,
they
could
fish
with
bait,
isn't
that
true
at
their
accustomed
places?
justice
william
o.
douglas
ah!
no,
but
they
could
fish
at
their
accustomed
places
with
--
provided
they
use
a
right
kind
of
equipment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
--
so
far
to
see
a
violation
of
the
treaty
in
--
since
the
accustomed
place
is
not
taken
away.
justice
william
o.

to
what

that

made
