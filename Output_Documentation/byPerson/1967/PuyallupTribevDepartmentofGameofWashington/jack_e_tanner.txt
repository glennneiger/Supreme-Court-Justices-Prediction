mr.
jack
e.
tanner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
also
comes
on
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
washington
state
supreme
court
and
as
united
states
says
in
their
brief,
the
facts
are
so
bare
as
to
leave
no
room
for
accommodation.
after
three
weeks
of
trying
the
puyallup
case
that
we
could
not
afford
because
of
the
economic
situation
of
my
clients,
we
decided
with
the
state
that
we
would
agree
to
certain
facts.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
certain
facts.
one,
that
the
particular
petitioners
were
allowed
to
continue
with
their
method
of
fishing,
it
would
virtually
destroy
the
fish
runs.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
just
by
me
and
my
clients,
your
honor,
and
i
assume
the
state.
because
you
see,
we
disagree
with
both
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
are
twelve
named
individuals,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
most
of
them
are
or
some
of
them
are
--
very
difficult
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
if
it
could
be
called
commercial
fishermen,
they
are
the
commercial
fishermen.
they
are
the
ones
that
fish
at
the
river
here,
that
is
directly
southwest
of
--
this
is
the
puyallup,
the
nisqually
is
down
here
on
a
torch
mountain
here.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
spawning
area
also,
right
of
what
they
call
the
nisqually.
i
am
sure
justice
douglas
is
familiar
with
the
situation.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
off
the
reservation,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
below
the
reservation.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
a
problem.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
right.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
all
indians,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
was
raised
at
the
trial
court
or
we
have
had
litigation
as
to
what
is
an
indian
as
to
the
state
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
or
is
that
1/4th.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
thought
it
was
1/4th,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there's
no
question
about
that
which
would
then
raise
the
question
if
i
was
an
non-indian
and
my
wife
was
a
member
of
an
enrolled
indian
tribe,
could
she
then
designate
her
rights
to
me
to
catch
the
fish
since
she
is
physically
unable
to
do
so?
now,
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
gave
the
indians
that
we're
talking
about
here
some
right.
now,
we
feel,
it
was
a
contractual
matter
between
the
united
states
and
those
various
indian
tribes
in
which
puyallups
is
one
and
the
nisqually
is
another.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
or
in
a
married
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
well,
they
are,
as
parties
have
agreed,
successors-in-interest
to
those
signators
to
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
in
which
the
nisqually
tribe
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
not
by
purchase;
probably
by
marriage.
in
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
is
the
son
of
the
oldest
living
nisqually.
there's
only
about
33
living
nisquallies,
the
way
i
understand
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
only
33;
about
33.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
there
are
between
300
and
400,
somewhere
in
that.
the
term
--
the
number
347
is
in
my
mind
for
some
reason
but
i
think
it's
between
300
and
400.
by
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
have.
one
of
the
problem
is
there
are
so
few
that
are
now
living
is
because
of
the
injustices
and
indignity
is
heaped
upon
the
indian
people.
their
life
expectancy
about
42;
their
educational
achievement,
grade
iv
and
this
is
the
reason,
gentlemen
that
at
least
my
clients,
and
that
perhaps
they're
right,
disagree
with
the
test
either
reasonable
or
necessary
and
the
indispensable
test
by
the
umatilla
case.
we
feel
that
the
treaty
either
gave
them
a
property
interest
in
the
fish
or
gave
them
nothing.
and
in
the
answer
to
the
many
questions
propounded
to
counsel
by
this
court,
i
would
say
this.
yes,
the
indians
do
have
a
right
to
take
every
fish
that
goes
up
to
that
nisqually
river,
every
single
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
have
no
knowledge
and
i
haven't
received
no
information
from
the
state,
either
at
the
trial
court
level
or
any
place
else,
your
honor,
where
the
indians
have
ever
destroyed
a
fish
run.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
if
they
so
chose
to
destroy
their
run
for
some
reason,
i
would
say
under
the
treaty,
they
could
do
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
that
the
commercial
reason
--
you
see
they're
very
limited
in
the
commercial
fishery
actually.
they
eat
them
and
they
sell
them
and
they
trade
them.
it
keeps
them
off
the
welfare.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
extent
of
12
individuals,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
catching
the
fish
by
net,
i
do
not
have
the
figures
but
i
do
know
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think,
perhaps,
sir,
i
could
explain
it
in
this
particular
situation.
i
do
know
that
when
they
are
allowed
to
catch
the
fish,
not
prohibited
from
catching
any
fish,
that
they
stay
off
a
welfare
rolls
of
the
state
of
washington
and
are
entirely
self-sustaining
economically.
and
when
they
are
prohibited
from
catching
fish,
and
many
other
must
then
resort
to
the
welfare
rolls.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
they're
12.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
are
very
few
other
fish
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so.
i
think
the
treaty
gave
them
something
and
those
fish
bar
property
rights,
obviously.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
least
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
there
are
histories
and
there
are
certain
written
documents
that
there
is
no
question
from
the
time
of
fishing
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
indians
took
the
fish
by
much
more
efficient
method
than
they're
taking
now,
much
more
efficient
methods:
fish
baskets,
fish
wheels,
nets
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
of
course,
because
you
see
it
was
a
matter
of
survival
of
taking
them
and
obviously,
at
that
time,
there
are
--
the
histories
are
replete
with
the
streams
being
so
filled
with
fish
that
you
literally
walked
across
the
streams
on
the
back
of
them.
what
had
happened
with
the
advent,
and
the
on
rush
of
our
highly
technical
society
now
and
the
competition
of
many
foreign
countries
for
fish,
the
fish
are
being
systematically
destroyed
and
not
by
the
indians.
the
fish
at
that
time
and
i
can
remember,
the
boy
fish
being
sold
for
two
for
quarter
in
the
puget
sound
area
have
now
suddenly
become,
in
many
instances,
worth
$10
a
piece.
and
the
indians
being
at
perhaps
the
lowest
scale
in
our
american
society,
politically,
economically
and
socially,
they
are
the
targets
of
the
moneyed
interest
to
catch
the
fish
commercially,
by
the
big
steamships,
the
latest
radar,
sonar
and
other
equipment
that
they
very
efficient
take
the
fish.
and
this
is
why,
at
least
my
clients
are
in
the
position
that
they
are
against
the
indispensable
rule
set
down
by
umatilla.
the
indispensable
rule,
i
think
i
should
point
out,
is
a
dangerous
rule,
even
though
united
states
through
the
department
of
justice
is
in
favor
of
umatilla
rule.
this
is
accommodation
and
compromise.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it's
available,
sir,
but
it's
not
in
this
record.
i
know
that
it
is
available.
i
have
seen
it.
when
we
were
placed
in
the
position
in
these
cases
as
the
indians
were
going
to
be
placed
in
the
position
if
this
court
does
not
uphold
their
treaty
right
to
take
all
the
fish
in
the
position
of
further
litigation
because
the
state
of
washington,
just
as
i
have
determined
what
is
reasonable
and
necessary
is
going
to
determine
to
the
state
courts
what
is
indispensable.
once
that
happens,
i
think
we're
going
to
be
back
in
this
court
under
a
different
issue
that's
going
about
separate,
but
equal
and
this
court
has
denied
the
separate
but
equal
philosophy
in
many
states
in
this
country,
namely
in
the
school
cases.
but
that's
what
the
indispensable
rule
will
lead
us
if
we
follow
it
to
its
--
the
end
of
the
river.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
i
would
think
that
even
though
the
fish
must
run
further
down
the
water
line
in
the
lower
puget
sound,
subject
to
the
predators,
further
hazards
that
the
still
1%
that
the
state
says,
and
these
are
state
witnesses,
all
biologists
hired
testifying
for
the
state
because
these
indians
can't
afford
them,
that
there
must
be
a
1%
escapement,
which
means
if
one
of
the
indians
catches
one
fish
off
the
mouth
of
nisqually
river,
that
virtually
destroys
particular
fish
run.
so,
our
position
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
and
if
you
take
one
of
them,
sir.
the
state's
position
is,
obviously,
that
it
would
virtually
destroy
the
run
because
only
99
got
up
to
that
river
instead
of
100.
so
what
they
are
doing
under
the
guise
of
conservation,
you
see
this
is
not
conservation
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
state
has
decided
politically,
not
legally,
politically
that
those
fish
that
come
back
from
the
ocean
that
are
coming
down
to
the
straits
and
down
in
the
puget
sound
and
the
lower
puget
sound,
are
going
to
be
caught
by
sports
fishermen
who
can
afford
to
be
out
there
and
by
commercial
fishermen.
they
have
by
--under
the
guise
of
conservation
eliminated
any
fish
from
the
indians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
they
are
unable
to
fish
out
of
the
sound.
the
reason,
there
is
two
reasons
for
putting
a
net
across
the
part
of
the
river.
the
two
reasons
are:
it
is
much
more
economical
to
do
so,
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
the
net
up
there,
and
this
is
the
best
place
to
catch
the
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
they
can't
afford
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
but
i
think
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice.
a
purse
seiner,
for
instance,
or
any
other
kind
of
a
semi-steamship
can
catch
more
fish
in
one
day
than
the
indians
who
probably
catch
them
in
five
years
with
their
limited
operation.
all
they
do
is
scoop
them
up.
we
had
an
international
incident
off
the
coast
of
washington,
the
russian
fleet.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
on
the
other
side,
olympic
waters.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
but
that
is
where
most
of
those
fishes
are
coming
from
out
there
with
russians.
they
know
where
they
are
too
just
as
the
indians
know
the
best
place
to
catch
them
so
do
the
russians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
you
have
strictly
within
the
domestic
waters
of
america
after
they
clear
the
canadian
waters
and
those
steamships,
with
their
tremendous
gear,
follow
their
fish
cur
down
up
to
what
is
called
“brown's
point”,
approximately
right
off
in
here
almost
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
and
scooping
in
the
mouth.
that's
where
the
fish
go
obviously.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
answer
to
that
–
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
answer
to
that
is
this:
the
state
cannot
do
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
limit
the
commercial
fisher
in
that
sound.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
if
what
we're
talking
about
a
conservation,
a
real
conservation
of
the
anodramous
fish,
which
has
become
such
an
important
food
supply
to
people
throughout
the
world,
it
then
it
must
be
controlled
back
up
at
the
source
and
the
only
people
that
could
control
it
is
going
to
be
the
federal
government.
if
we're
going
to
compete
with
russia,
japan,
canada
and
probably
other
countries,
for
that
anodramous
fish
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
doing,
then
we
must
have
the
federal
fishery
so
then
you
can
see
their
control
is
in
here
and
out
there.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
oregon
and
idaho,
who
are
part
of
this
case
through
amicus
briefs,
have
the
same
problem.
the
difference
is,
there
probably
more
of
these
particular
streams
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
predict
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
on
san
francisco
bay?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
one
of
the
rivers,
sir
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
as
a
practical
matter,
i
do
not
believe
the
state
can
do
the
job.
i
do
not
think
one
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
legally,
they
can.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
except
at
the
usual,
accustomed
fishing
ground;
and
that's
the
river.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
many
of
the
northwest
treaties
has
come
to
point
out
before
having
similar
or
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
--
language.
now,
this
particular
treaty
became
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
of
the
sixth
amendment
obviously,
making
the
treaties
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
the
treaty
--
with
this
particular
treaty,
was
signed
before
washington
was
a
state.
the
person
who've
signed
for
the
federal
government,
which
is
the
territorial
government
of
the
state
of
washington
and
the
indian
agent
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
the
state
of
washington
was
not
a
state
at
that
time.
there
has
been
nothing
you
say
that
at
least
we
can
discover
the
petitioners
that
abolished
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
alright.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
can
remember
–
i
think
it
was
this
court
that
said
“great
nations
keep
their
word”.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
and
at
that
time
of
the
treaty,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
word
is,
that
you
shall
have
the
right
in
1854
to
take
the
fish,
to
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
states
or
grounds.
(voice
overlap)
they
had
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
the
winans
case,
the
course
is
195
and
those
cases
always
said
that
it
was
a
grant
from
the
indians
--
federal
government
the
right
of
those
to
fish
in
comity,
not
a
grant
from
the
federal
government
of
the
indians
that
the
state
without
its
police
but
this
court
has
said
that
that
grant
was
from
the
federal
--
from
the
indians
to
the
federal
government.
you
know
it
was
obviously
why
they
did
it,
sir,
to
keep
those
indians
from
killing
white
settlers
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
yes,
and
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
now
the
federal
government
did
not
care
give
the
indians
answer.
the
indian
that
guaranteed
to
federal
government
that,
that
they
would
let
the
settlers
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
same
language.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
my
interpretation
of
what
this
court's
did
in
the
winans
case.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
they
got
paid
for
it
years
ago.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think,
sir,
that
the
language
of
the
treaty,
which
is
subject
to
interpretation
apparently,
is
that
the
indians
gave
those
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them.
now,
if
i
have
that
property
right
and
i'm
going
to
give
that
property
right
to
you,
i
would
think
that
i
would
reserve
the
privileges
of
immunities
that
i
might
not
give
to
you.
if
you're
giving
it
to
me,
you
might
reserve
certain
privileges
of
immunities.
but
our
position
is,
that
the
indians
gave
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
the
indians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
don't
know,
sir,
the
answer
to
that
question;
1854,
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
it's
inherent
in
the
treaty.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
in
the
treaty,
they're
to
retain
this
right,
until
that
right
is
extinguished
or
terminated
in
the
proper
manner.
for
instance,
the
state
knew
of
the
treaty
with
the
indians
at
the
time
it
became
a
state.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
state
of
washington,
then
reached
statehood,
extinguished
anything
as
far
as
the
indians
were
concerned,
has
the
right
to
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
as
to
my
understanding
with
that
treaty,
and
my
position,
your
honor,
is
this:
at
the
time
that
the
treaty
was
made
with
the
indians
right
up
to
the
present
time,
gentlemen,
it's
my
position
that
the
united
states
dealing
with
the
indians
or
the
successors-in-interest
of
the
signators
to
that
treaty,
the
united
states
did
guarantee
to
the
indians
those
rights
and
they
did
guarantee
that
the
state
could
not
terminate
that
treaty
because
you
see
this
is
exactly
what
their
practice
or
doing.
if
the
state
is
allowed
to
impose
one
single
regulation
or
standard
upon
the
conduct
of
indian
fishing
then
that
treaty
is
terminated.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
whole
treaty,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
the
basic
–
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
section
3,
sir.
i
think
section
3.
at
least
under
these
particular
cases
are
the
pertinent
sections
that
the
indians
were
basically
interested
here.
at
least,
no
similarly
situated
in
the
northwest
as
the
nisqually
indians
are
basing
their
dignity
as
indian
people
upon
the
word
of
the
united
states
to
uphold
these
treaties,
especially
section
3
because
that's
all
they
have
left.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
interpretation,
your
honor,
is
that
the
indians
gave
it
to
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
also
comes
on
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
washington
state
supreme
court
and
as
united
states
says
in
their
brief,
the
facts
are
so
bare
as
to
leave
no
room
for
accommodation.
after
three
weeks
of
trying
the
puyallup
case
that
we
could
not
afford
because
of
the
economic
situation
of
my
clients,
we
decided
with
the
state
that
we
would
agree
to
certain
facts.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
certain
facts.
one,
that
the
particular
petitioners
were
allowed
to
continue
with
their
method
of
fishing,
it
would
virtually
destroy
the
fish
runs.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
just
by
me
and
my
clients,
your
honor,
and
i
assume
the
state.
because
you
see,
we
disagree
with
both
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
are
twelve
named
individuals,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
most
of
them
are
or
some
of
them
are
--
very
difficult
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
if
it
could
be
called
commercial
fishermen,
they
are
the
commercial
fishermen.
they
are
the
ones
that
fish
at
the
river
here,
that
is
directly
southwest
of
--
this
is
the
puyallup,
the
nisqually
is
down
here
on
a
torch
mountain
here.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
spawning
area
also,
right
of
what
they
call
the
nisqually.
i
am
sure
justice
douglas
is
familiar
with
the
situation.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
off
the
reservation,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
below
the
reservation.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
a
problem.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
right.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
all
indians,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
was
raised
at
the
trial
court
or
we
have
had
litigation
as
to
what
is
an
indian
as
to
the
state
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
or
is
that
1/4th.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
thought
it
was
1/4th,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there's
no
question
about
that
which
would
then
raise
the
question
if
i
was
an
non-indian
and
my
wife
was
a
member
of
an
enrolled
indian
tribe,
could
she
then
designate
her
rights
to
me
to
catch
the
fish
since
she
is
physically
unable
to
do
so?
now,
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
gave
the
indians
that
we're
talking
about
here
some
right.
now,
we
feel,
it
was
a
contractual
matter
between
the
united
states
and
those
various
indian
tribes
in
which
puyallups
is
one
and
the
nisqually
is
another.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
or
in
a
married
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
well,
they
are,
as
parties
have
agreed,
successors-in-interest
to
those
signators
to
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
in
which
the
nisqually
tribe
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
not
by
purchase;
probably
by
marriage.
in
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
is
the
son
of
the
oldest
living
nisqually.
there's
only
about
33
living
nisquallies,
the
way
i
understand
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
only
33;
about
33.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
there
are
between
300
and
400,
somewhere
in
that.
the
term
--
the
number
347
is
in
my
mind
for
some
reason
but
i
think
it's
between
300
and
400.
by
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
have.
one
of
the
problem
is
there
are
so
few
that
are
now
living
is
because
of
the
injustices
and
indignity
is
heaped
upon
the
indian
people.
their
life
expectancy
about
42;
their
educational
achievement,
grade
iv
and
this
is
the
reason,
gentlemen
that
at
least
my
clients,
and
that
perhaps
they're
right,
disagree
with
the
test
either
reasonable
or
necessary
and
the
indispensable
test
by
the
umatilla
case.
we
feel
that
the
treaty
either
gave
them
a
property
interest
in
the
fish
or
gave
them
nothing.
and
in
the
answer
to
the
many
questions
propounded
to
counsel
by
this
court,
i
would
say
this.
yes,
the
indians
do
have
a
right
to
take
every
fish
that
goes
up
to
that
nisqually
river,
every
single
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
have
no
knowledge
and
i
haven't
received
no
information
from
the
state,
either
at
the
trial
court
level
or
any
place
else,
your
honor,
where
the
indians
have
ever
destroyed
a
fish
run.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
if
they
so
chose
to
destroy
their
run
for
some
reason,
i
would
say
under
the
treaty,
they
could
do
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
that
the
commercial
reason
--
you
see
they're
very
limited
in
the
commercial
fishery
actually.
they
eat
them
and
they
sell
them
and
they
trade
them.
it
keeps
them
off
the
welfare.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
extent
of
12
individuals,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
catching
the
fish
by
net,
i
do
not
have
the
figures
but
i
do
know
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think,
perhaps,
sir,
i
could
explain
it
in
this
particular
situation.
i
do
know
that
when
they
are
allowed
to
catch
the
fish,
not
prohibited
from
catching
any
fish,
that
they
stay
off
a
welfare
rolls
of
the
state
of
washington
and
are
entirely
self-sustaining
economically.
and
when
they
are
prohibited
from
catching
fish,
and
many
other
must
then
resort
to
the
welfare
rolls.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
they're
12.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
are
very
few
other
fish
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so.
i
think
the
treaty
gave
them
something
and
those
fish
bar
property
rights,
obviously.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
least
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
there
are
histories
and
there
are
certain
written
documents
that
there
is
no
question
from
the
time
of
fishing
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
indians
took
the
fish
by
much
more
efficient
method
than
they're
taking
now,
much
more
efficient
methods:
fish
baskets,
fish
wheels,
nets
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
of
course,
because
you
see
it
was
a
matter
of
survival
of
taking
them
and
obviously,
at
that
time,
there
are
--
the
histories
are
replete
with
the
streams
being
so
filled
with
fish
that
you
literally
walked
across
the
streams
on
the
back
of
them.
what
had
happened
with
the
advent,
and
the
on
rush
of
our
highly
technical
society
now
and
the
competition
of
many
foreign
countries
for
fish,
the
fish
are
being
systematically
destroyed
and
not
by
the
indians.
the
fish
at
that
time
and
i
can
remember,
the
boy
fish
being
sold
for
two
for
quarter
in
the
puget
sound
area
have
now
suddenly
become,
in
many
instances,
worth
$10
a
piece.
and
the
indians
being
at
perhaps
the
lowest
scale
in
our
american
society,
politically,
economically
and
socially,
they
are
the
targets
of
the
moneyed
interest
to
catch
the
fish
commercially,
by
the
big
steamships,
the
latest
radar,
sonar
and
other
equipment
that
they
very
efficient
take
the
fish.
and
this
is
why,
at
least
my
clients
are
in
the
position
that
they
are
against
the
indispensable
rule
set
down
by
umatilla.
the
indispensable
rule,
i
think
i
should
point
out,
is
a
dangerous
rule,
even
though
united
states
through
the
department
of
justice
is
in
favor
of
umatilla
rule.
this
is
accommodation
and
compromise.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it's
available,
sir,
but
it's
not
in
this
record.
i
know
that
it
is
available.
i
have
seen
it.
when
we
were
placed
in
the
position
in
these
cases
as
the
indians
were
going
to
be
placed
in
the
position
if
this
court
does
not
uphold
their
treaty
right
to
take
all
the
fish
in
the
position
of
further
litigation
because
the
state
of
washington,
just
as
i
have
determined
what
is
reasonable
and
necessary
is
going
to
determine
to
the
state
courts
what
is
indispensable.
once
that
happens,
i
think
we're
going
to
be
back
in
this
court
under
a
different
issue
that's
going
about
separate,
but
equal
and
this
court
has
denied
the
separate
but
equal
philosophy
in
many
states
in
this
country,
namely
in
the
school
cases.
but
that's
what
the
indispensable
rule
will
lead
us
if
we
follow
it
to
its
--
the
end
of
the
river.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
i
would
think
that
even
though
the
fish
must
run
further
down
the
water
line
in
the
lower
puget
sound,
subject
to
the
predators,
further
hazards
that
the
still
1%
that
the
state
says,
and
these
are
state
witnesses,
all
biologists
hired
testifying
for
the
state
because
these
indians
can't
afford
them,
that
there
must
be
a
1%
escapement,
which
means
if
one
of
the
indians
catches
one
fish
off
the
mouth
of
nisqually
river,
that
virtually
destroys
particular
fish
run.
so,
our
position
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
and
if
you
take
one
of
them,
sir.
the
state's
position
is,
obviously,
that
it
would
virtually
destroy
the
run
because
only
99
got
up
to
that
river
instead
of
100.
so
what
they
are
doing
under
the
guise
of
conservation,
you
see
this
is
not
conservation
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
state
has
decided
politically,
not
legally,
politically
that
those
fish
that
come
back
from
the
ocean
that
are
coming
down
to
the
straits
and
down
in
the
puget
sound
and
the
lower
puget
sound,
are
going
to
be
caught
by
sports
fishermen
who
can
afford
to
be
out
there
and
by
commercial
fishermen.
they
have
by
--under
the
guise
of
conservation
eliminated
any
fish
from
the
indians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
they
are
unable
to
fish
out
of
the
sound.
the
reason,
there
is
two
reasons
for
putting
a
net
across
the
part
of
the
river.
the
two
reasons
are:
it
is
much
more
economical
to
do
so,
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
the
net
up
there,
and
this
is
the
best
place
to
catch
the
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
they
can't
afford
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
but
i
think
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice.
a
purse
seiner,
for
instance,
or
any
other
kind
of
a
semi-steamship
can
catch
more
fish
in
one
day
than
the
indians
who
probably
catch
them
in
five
years
with
their
limited
operation.
all
they
do
is
scoop
them
up.
we
had
an
international
incident
off
the
coast
of
washington,
the
russian
fleet.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
on
the
other
side,
olympic
waters.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
but
that
is
where
most
of
those
fishes
are
coming
from
out
there
with
russians.
they
know
where
they
are
too
just
as
the
indians
know
the
best
place
to
catch
them
so
do
the
russians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no,
you
have
strictly
within
the
domestic
waters
of
america
after
they
clear
the
canadian
waters
and
those
steamships,
with
their
tremendous
gear,
follow
their
fish
cur
down
up
to
what
is
called
“brown's
point”,
approximately
right
off
in
here
almost
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
and
scooping
in
the
mouth.
that's
where
the
fish
go
obviously.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
answer
to
that
–
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
answer
to
that
is
this:
the
state
cannot
do
it.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
limit
the
commercial
fisher
in
that
sound.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
if
what
we're
talking
about
a
conservation,
a
real
conservation
of
the
anodramous
fish,
which
has
become
such
an
important
food
supply
to
people
throughout
the
world,
it
then
it
must
be
controlled
back
up
at
the
source
and
the
only
people
that
could
control
it
is
going
to
be
the
federal
government.
if
we're
going
to
compete
with
russia,
japan,
canada
and
probably
other
countries,
for
that
anodramous
fish
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
doing,
then
we
must
have
the
federal
fishery
so
then
you
can
see
their
control
is
in
here
and
out
there.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
oregon
and
idaho,
who
are
part
of
this
case
through
amicus
briefs,
have
the
same
problem.
the
difference
is,
there
probably
more
of
these
particular
streams
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
predict
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
on
san
francisco
bay?
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
one
of
the
rivers,
sir
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
no.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
as
a
practical
matter,
i
do
not
believe
the
state
can
do
the
job.
i
do
not
think
one
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
legally,
they
can.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
except
at
the
usual,
accustomed
fishing
ground;
and
that's
the
river.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
many
of
the
northwest
treaties
has
come
to
point
out
before
having
similar
or
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
--
language.
now,
this
particular
treaty
became
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
of
the
sixth
amendment
obviously,
making
the
treaties
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
the
treaty
--
with
this
particular
treaty,
was
signed
before
washington
was
a
state.
the
person
who've
signed
for
the
federal
government,
which
is
the
territorial
government
of
the
state
of
washington
and
the
indian
agent
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
the
state
of
washington
was
not
a
state
at
that
time.
there
has
been
nothing
you
say
that
at
least
we
can
discover
the
petitioners
that
abolished
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
alright.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
can
remember
–
i
think
it
was
this
court
that
said
“great
nations
keep
their
word”.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
and
at
that
time
of
the
treaty,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
word
is,
that
you
shall
have
the
right
in
1854
to
take
the
fish,
to
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
states
or
grounds.
(voice
overlap)
they
had
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
the
winans
case,
the
course
is
195
and
those
cases
always
said
that
it
was
a
grant
from
the
indians
--
federal
government
the
right
of
those
to
fish
in
comity,
not
a
grant
from
the
federal
government
of
the
indians
that
the
state
without
its
police
but
this
court
has
said
that
that
grant
was
from
the
federal
--
from
the
indians
to
the
federal
government.
you
know
it
was
obviously
why
they
did
it,
sir,
to
keep
those
indians
from
killing
white
settlers
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
yes,
and
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
now
the
federal
government
did
not
care
give
the
indians
answer.
the
indian
that
guaranteed
to
federal
government
that,
that
they
would
let
the
settlers
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
same
language.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
this
is
my
interpretation
of
what
this
court's
did
in
the
winans
case.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
they
got
paid
for
it
years
ago.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think,
sir,
that
the
language
of
the
treaty,
which
is
subject
to
interpretation
apparently,
is
that
the
indians
gave
those
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them.
now,
if
i
have
that
property
right
and
i'm
going
to
give
that
property
right
to
you,
i
would
think
that
i
would
reserve
the
privileges
of
immunities
that
i
might
not
give
to
you.
if
you're
giving
it
to
me,
you
might
reserve
certain
privileges
of
immunities.
but
our
position
is,
that
the
indians
gave
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
the
indians.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
don't
know,
sir,
the
answer
to
that
question;
1854,
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
think
it's
inherent
in
the
treaty.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
in
the
treaty,
they're
to
retain
this
right,
until
that
right
is
extinguished
or
terminated
in
the
proper
manner.
for
instance,
the
state
knew
of
the
treaty
with
the
indians
at
the
time
it
became
a
state.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
state
of
washington,
then
reached
statehood,
extinguished
anything
as
far
as
the
indians
were
concerned,
has
the
right
to
fish.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
as
to
my
understanding
with
that
treaty,
and
my
position,
your
honor,
is
this:
at
the
time
that
the
treaty
was
made
with
the
indians
right
up
to
the
present
time,
gentlemen,
it's
my
position
that
the
united
states
dealing
with
the
indians
or
the
successors-in-interest
of
the
signators
to
that
treaty,
the
united
states
did
guarantee
to
the
indians
those
rights
and
they
did
guarantee
that
the
state
could
not
terminate
that
treaty
because
you
see
this
is
exactly
what
their
practice
or
doing.
if
the
state
is
allowed
to
impose
one
single
regulation
or
standard
upon
the
conduct
of
indian
fishing
then
that
treaty
is
terminated.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
the
whole
treaty,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
because
the
basic
–
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
section
3,
sir.
i
think
section
3.
at
least
under
these
particular
cases
are
the
pertinent
sections
that
the
indians
were
basically
interested
here.
at
least,
no
similarly
situated
in
the
northwest
as
the
nisqually
indians
are
basing
their
dignity
as
indian
people
upon
the
word
of
the
united
states
to
uphold
these
treaties,
especially
section
3
because
that's
all
they
have
left.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
my
interpretation,
your
honor,
is
that
the
indians
gave
it
to
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jack
e.
tanner
that's
correct.
