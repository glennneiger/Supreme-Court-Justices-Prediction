justice
abe
fortas
well,
i've
been
having
a
little
difficulty
with
what
i
regard
as
sort
of
the
fundamental
setting
of
this
case.
this
case
was
begun,
was
it
not,
by
the
state
agency,
an
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
filed
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
the
indians.
and
it
seemed
that
to
me,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
this,
that
the
injunction
sought
was
in
very
broad
terms,
but
the
only
specific
law
or
regulations
of
the
state
of
washington
that
i
recall
being
presented
at
least
to
us
and
so
far
as
i
know,
to
the
lower
court's
was
the
netting
regulations,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
that
brief.
i'm
talking
about
such
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
have
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
case
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
right
about
this
being
a
kind
of
a
case
in
which
we're
asked
to
consider
types
of
regulations
and
not
specifically
described
and
presented
in
so
many
words.
and
so
far
as
i
can
see,
the
only
specific
thing
that
we
have
before
us
this
problem
about
net
fishing.
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
in
terms
of
the
way
this
litigation
and
this
case
is
actually
litigated
below,
is
anything
before
us
out
of
them
the
use
of
nets?
is
anything
before
us
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
fish
that
the
indians
could
take
otherwise
and
by
nets
for
example?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
are
you
telling
us
that
unless
the
indians
use
nets,
they
can't
catch
any
fish
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
whole
puget
sound.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
puyallups
are
there?
how
many
are
there
at
the
tribe,
do
you
know,
mr.
tanner?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
filed
a
separate
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
filed
a
separate
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
a
problem
though
here
because
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
the
indians
have
been
guaranteed
the
right
of
taking
fish
in
all
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory.
i
suppose
you
have
to
argue
that
“in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory”
did
not
subject
you
to
the
same
regulations
that
are
applicable
to
all
other
citizens
of
the
territory.
justice
abe
fortas
you
take
that
position?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
a
regulation
that
we're
here
talking
about,
a
regulation
which
is
applicable
to
everybody
by
its
terms
and
your
complaint
is,
that
it
has
a
different
impact
on
the
indians.
but
what
is
there
in
the
treaty
that
recognizes
that
particular
right
of
the
indians
to
have
fishing
rights
that
are
more
favorable
than
those
of
the
other
citizens
of
the
territory.
i'm
asking
you
a
very
elementary
and
fundamental
question,
but
this
is
not
like
some
of
the
other
indian
situations
in
the
language
of
this
treaty.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
like
some
of
the
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
--
let's
assume
you've
got
all
the
rights
that
are
specified
in
these
treaty.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
there
in
this
treaty
that
commits
the
united
states
to
assure
to
you
rights,
privileges
or
prerogatives
that
are
superior
to
those
of
other
people
of
the
former
territory,
now
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
what's
the
word
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out:
what
is
the
word?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
the
common
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
this
treaty
said,
as
i
understand
it
is
that,
the
indians
are
going
to
stay
on
the
reservation,
but
they
can
fish
anywhere,
they
have
fished,
they've
been
accustomed
to
fishing
even
if
those
other
places
are
in
private
possession,
or
you
have
to
go
with
private
lands,
private
property
to
get
to
them,
but
that
your
fishing
rights
in
those
other
places
are
in
common
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
territory.
now,
that's
why
i
read
this
treaty
and
if
you
disagree
with
that,
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me.
in
other
words,
the
indians,
in
return
for
this
tremendous
transfer,
this
transfer
of
tremendous
acrage
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
different
matter
though.
first,
we
have
to
find
out
what
treaty
says.
i
know
there
are
lots
of
other
considerations,
but
this
treaty
says,
“indians
are
going
to
stay
on
the
reservation
except
that
they
may
fish
wherever
they've
been
accustomed
to
fish
in
common
with
other
people
in
the
territory
and
you
can
even
go
across
privately
owned
land
to
do
that.”
now,
what
you're
saying
here
is,
as
i
understand
that
is
that,
in
common
with
the
other
people
of
the
territory
does
not
mean
that
you
can
be
subjected
to
rules,
regulations,
and
statutes
of
the
state
of
washington
anyway,
applicable
to
everybody
else
in
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
is
where
i
have
difficulty
because
i
--
so
far
as
the
treaty
is
concerned,
because
i
see
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
treaty
that
would
support
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
mr.
martin
as
statutes
and
regulations
at
the
state
of
washington
although
in
terms
they
are
applicable
to
indians
and
non-indians,
in
fact,
there
is
an
indian
effect.
their
impact
on
the
indians
is
much
more
severe
than
it
is
on
the
other
services,
who
have
a
right
in
common
with
the
indians?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martin,
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
a
little
different
thing?
what
is
the
effect
or
possible
effect
of
the
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
i
noticed
reference
to
regulation
adopted
by
the
secretary
which
i
take
it
has
not
been
implemented?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
would
he
have
power
in
your
opinion
to
supersede
the
regulations
and
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
for
this
purpose
not
only
with
respect
to
the
indians,
but
also
with
respect
to
fishing
regulations
generally
in
the
sound?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
regulation
at
the
issue
has
no
possible
help
to
us
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
next
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
relating
to
that
is
just
exactly
what
does
the
government
mean
by
the
proposal
in
its
brief?
what
do
you
think
as
practical
matter
or
as
a
specific
matter
ought
to
be
the
mandate
of
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
your
term
“brought
up”,
i
don't
want
to
be
rude
but
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
insist
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
this
court
ought
to
do
the
right
thing.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
do
you
have
a
more
specific
idea?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
would
you
do
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
reverse
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
position
goes
a
little
further
than
that
because
you
say
that
too
that
unless
the
state
so
regulates
that
entire
fishery
that
enough
fish
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
to
permit
the
indians
to
catch
a
“reasonable
number”
and
to
permit
perpetuation
of
the
run
then
the
state
cannot
impose
any
regulation
on
the
indians?
justice
abe
fortas
but
taking
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
you,
you
say
not
merely
that
the
state
can
regulate
the
number
that
the
indians
take
and
the
state
must
let
the
indians
take
everything,
take
fish
above
the
number
necessary
to
maintain
the
run.
you
do
say
that,
but
you
also
say
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
state
as
a
condition
precedent
to
imposing
this
obligation
on
the
indians,
so
to
regulate
the
entire
fishery,
as
to
make
certain
in
ordinary
circumstances
that
enough
fish
will
come
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
so
that
the
indians
--
so
that
indians
could
let
some
through
to
perpetuate
the
run
and
also
they
indians
would
have
a
reasonable
number
for
themselves.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
have
to
find
reasonable
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
wondering
is
whether
we're
getting
into
somewhat
the
same
situation
we
have
in
wisconsin
case.
i
think
you
are
about
to
get
to
that
menominee
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
the
state
said
the
federal
government
ought
to
relieve
them
of
the
burden
of
taking
care
of
the
indian
rights
and
the
federal
government
said,
“well,
they
are
entitled
to
rights”
certainly
but
the
state
is
required
to
accept
the
burden.
now,
are
we
in
one
of
those
kind
of
binds
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that.
is
that
the
number
of
fish
that
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
total
bar
show
the
number
of
fish
that
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
indians
and
then
number
of
fish
that
escaped,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
government's
point
is
that
you
just
turn
letting
enough
fish
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup.
that's
a
very
rough
and
inaccurate
statement
of
him,
but
that
will
suffice
to
insight
you
to
respond?
justice
abe
fortas
that
didn't
quite
add
because
add
because
your
adversary
say
that
the
state
of
washington
is
giving
the
indians
one
horse
and
one
rabbit
deal
that
instead
of
the
right
being
shared
in
common
with
other
citizens
by
reason
of
the
manner
of
regulation,
the
inadequate
regulation
of
commercial
fisheries,
you
are
not
giving
the
indians
anything
like
a
share
in
common.
that's
the
position
as
i
understand
it
in
saying
that
nominally,
because
you
say,
yes,
of
course,
you
can
fish
there
along
with
non-indians,
but
that
that
what
you've
done
is
to
deprive
that
right
of
any
substance
by
failing
to
make
sure
that
that
an
adequate
supply
of
fish
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
fresh
water?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
did
they
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
this,
some
of
or
part
of
your
argument.
statutes
are
set
out
in
your
brief,
aren't
they
on
pages
8
and
9?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
statute
prohibits
netting
in
the
waters
of
the
state.
that's
a
key
phrase,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
means
only
fresh
waters,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
and
there
must
be
some
provision
which
i
don't
see
it
here
which
permits
your
department
of
fisheries
to
make
exceptions
to
that,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what's
a
columbia
river?
how
did
they
permit
commercial
netting
in
the
columbia
river?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
the
state
does
permit
commercial
netting
in
salt
water?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
the
--
and
you
say
that
there's
a
limitation
on
that
in
terms
of
number
of
days
which
it
might
be
done,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that
might
be
fine
but
i
suppose
the
indians,
one
of
the
indian
statement
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
fish
at
customary
places
by
the
medicine
creek
treaty
and
that
then
the
state
comes
along
and
says,
“you
can't
fish
at
all
because
can't
--
net
at
all
here
in
fresh
water
for
conservation
reasons”
but
at
the
same
time,
the
state
permits
a
commercial
fisheries
to
net
in
the
salt
water.
now,
both
of
them
result
in
the
reduction
of
fish
population.
and
there
are
regulations
and
restrictions
with
respect
to
commercial
fisheries
and
the
question
that
we've
been
pursuing
here
as
i
understand
it,
is
why
can't
there
be
a
comparable
commercial
--
comparable
regulations
with
respect
to
the
indians'
use
of
nets.
now,
may
be
they
can't
be
in
terms
of
fish
taken,
but
can't
there
be
in
terms
of
some
reasonable
arrangements
with
respect
to
days
and
what
not?
the
fish
that
the
commercial
fisheries
catch,
don't
go
back
and
spawn.
may
be
some
of
them
are
on
their
way
back
from
having
spawn
but
others,
i
suppose,
are
on
their
way
to
the
river
to
spawn
and
that
matter
where
the
fish
is
apprehended
if
it
doesn't
get
to
it
spawning
place,
it
doesn't
spawn,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
is
it
your
contention
that
this
is
evenhanded
and
that
the
indians
are
not
being
regulated
more
drastically
than
the
commercial
fisheries?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
we're
pursuing
here
because
i'm
not
at
all
sure,
indians
have
a
right
to
pursue
their
fishing
at
customary
places.
customary
place
here
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
when
you
say
you
can't
do
it
at
the
same
time
you
permit
the
commercial
fisheries
to
use
nets
and
you
subject
them
to
regulation.
the
question
is
--
are
you
taking
your
interpretation
of
the
treaty
on
that
basis,
are
you
really
giving
the
indians
equivalent
or
equal
treatment
with
the
non-indians?
that's
a
question
and
it
is
somewhat
affected
by
practical
consideration
whether
you
could
subject
the
indians
to
comparable
regulations
–
that
is
in
terms
of
days
or
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
assuming
your
construction
which
is
that
this
is
a
“right
in
common”,
that
is
to
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
fish
there,
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state,
but
that
the
regulation
must
--
within
human
exacted
to
you
than
no
more,
they
even
handed
in
its
operation
on
the
indians
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
non-indians
on
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
public
regulation
about
salmon,
that
you
have
about
steelhead
trout,
i
can
understand
that
as
i
understand
on
steelhead
trout,
they
can
be
taken
only
by
hook
and
line
by
anybody.
justice
abe
fortas
and
here,
what
you
say
is
that
the
indians
can't
net.
nobody
can
net
in
fresh
water.
i
mean,
the
indians
can't
net
at
all
per
se
if
they
don't
have
any
particular
status
with
respect
to
salt
water
and
as
practical
matter
they
don't
engage
in
that
kind
of
commercial
fishing.
but
you
say
that
the
commercial
fisheries
can
net
out
in
salt
water
and
it's
arguable.
i'm
not
saying
anything
more
than
that
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
it's
arguable;
arguable
that
that
is
not
the
equality
of
treatment.
justice
abe
fortas
has
the
state
ever
attempted
to
make
any
contract
or
agreement
with
the
indians
here
and
get
federal
action
so
as
to
supersede
the
treaty
or
substitute
an
amendment
of
the
treaty
that
provide
some
substitute
right
for
the
indians
here,
whether
or
not
strictly
the
--
whatever
may
be
the
strict
construction
of
the
treaty?
because
if
you
start
of
with
the
conclusion,
i'm
not
saying
that
i
do
but
that's
what
this
litigation
is
about
fundamentally,
you
start
off
with
the
conclusions
that
the
indians
have
a
right
here
and
that
that
right
is
being
impaired
by
the
regulation.
the
fact
that
the
regulation
may
be
highly
desirable
and
i
think
you
made
what
sounds
to
me
at
the
moment
like
a
noble
almond
(ph)
case
to
that
effect,
but
that
that
kind
of
irrelevant
consideration.
probably,
you
start
off
with
the
conclusion
that
the
treaty
does
confer
a
right
on
the
indians
and
the
state
is
totally
depriving
the
indians
of
that
right
totally,
then
it's
a
very
difficult
case.
but
was
there
some
reference
to
another
situation
which
the
states
have
provided
the
indians
with
gear
and
boats
so
that
they
could
engage
in
salt
water
fishing?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
by
way
of
modification
of
the
treaty?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
these
treaties
can
be
modified
or
superseded
by
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
yes,
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
has
that
been
attempted?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
had
there
been
any
effort
to
obtain
an
amendment
so
far
as
this
treaty
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
referred
to
in
the
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
biologically
sound
to
--
would
it
be
biologically
sound
to
set
some
for
the
state
to
fix
such
certain
number
of
days
during
which
time
the
indians
may
fish?
they
use
nets
in
fresh
water?
justice
abe
fortas
at
any
time?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
cause
--
upsets
the
fish?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
any
difference
between
the
effect
of
the
indian
catch
and
the
non-indian
catch
on
the
columbia
river?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
what
difference
is
it
though
in
the
biological
cycle
of
the
salmon
whether
it's
caught
by
indian
or
non-indian?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
point
you're
making?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
--
on
the
columbia
river
are
they
not
regulated?
are
they
doing
something
that
non-indians
can't
do?
or
is
this
–
or
is
your
point
just
that
indians
are
catching
more
fish?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
they
doing
something
that
non-indians
can't
do,
cannot
do?
justice
abe
fortas
now
how
much
of
that
million
odd
pounds
is
counted
for
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
because
if
i
understand
it,
this
case
is
not
being
presented
anyway
on
the
theory
that
indians
ought
to
catch
less
and
non-indian
commercial
fisheries
ought
to
catch
more.
i
mean
to
say
that
that's
proposition
one
why
it's
kind
of
a
remote.
and
the
issues
here
and
the
question
is
whether
in
areas
where
indians
are
claiming
treaty
rights,
they
are
properly
claiming
treaty
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
--
whether
the
fish
had
been
caught
by
indians
on
one
hand
and
non-indians
on
the
other
hand,
both
of
them
being
subjected
to
the
same
regulation?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
oregon
would
also
--
you're
saying
that
oregon
would
also
apply
that
same
regulation
to
non-indians.
are
you
saying
that
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
why
don't
you
make
your
own
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
state
against
archer?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
embarrass
you
but
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
got
say
about
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
we
stand
now,
whatever
the
basis
might
have
been,
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
has
held
that
the
state
cannot
by
its
hunting
regulations
in
a
way
affect
the
rights
of
the
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
the
only
way
you
suggest
of
handling
that
case
is
for
us
to
establish
a
concrete
doctrine
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
gathered
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
indians
--
did
the
indians
still
--
there
is
still
a
reservation
in
existence
except
as
an
abstract
conception?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
indians
respectively?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
a
reservation
exists,
and
it
exists
conceptually
and
not
in
terms
of
land
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
concede
that
that
applies
to
the
puyallup
reservation?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
they
--
if
the
puyallup
indians
wanted
to
fish
upstream
on
the
puyallup
river
within
what
you
submit
as
a
reservation,
you
would
had
the
same
problem
with
which
we're
dealing
now?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
we
decided
that
this
treaty
did
not
give
the
indians
the
rights
for
which
you
contend,
how
many
indians
would
be
directly
affected?
do
you
or
somebody
here
said
the
only
one
who
is
endangered,
as
i
understand
it,
was
kind
of
fishing
don't
to
much
more
than
a
100
in
number.
justice
abe
fortas
off
the
way?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
fish
in
this
way?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
talking
only
about
the
puyallup
now?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i've
been
having
a
little
difficulty
with
what
i
regard
as
sort
of
the
fundamental
setting
of
this
case.
this
case
was
begun,
was
it
not,
by
the
state
agency,
an
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
filed
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
the
indians.
and
it
seemed
that
to
me,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
this,
that
the
injunction
sought
was
in
very
broad
terms,
but
the
only
specific
law
or
regulations
of
the
state
of
washington
that
i
recall
being
presented
at
least
to
us
and
so
far
as
i
know,
to
the
lower
court's
was
the
netting
regulations,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
that
brief.
i'm
talking
about
such
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
have
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
case
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
right
about
this
being
a
kind
of
a
case
in
which
we're
asked
to
consider
types
of
regulations
and
not
specifically
described
and
presented
in
so
many
words.
and
so
far
as
i
can
see,
the
only
specific
thing
that
we
have
before
us
this
problem
about
net
fishing.
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
in
terms
of
the
way
this
litigation
and
this
case
is
actually
litigated
below,
is
anything
before
us
out
of
them
the
use
of
nets?
is
anything
before
us
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
fish
that
the
indians
could
take
otherwise
and
by
nets
for
example?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
are
you
telling
us
that
unless
the
indians
use
nets,
they
can't
catch
any
fish
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
whole
puget
sound.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
puyallups
are
there?
how
many
are
there
at
the
tribe,
do
you
know,
mr.
tanner?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
filed
a
separate
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
filed
a
separate
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
a
problem
though
here
because
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
the
indians
have
been
guaranteed
the
right
of
taking
fish
in
all
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory.
i
suppose
you
have
to
argue
that
“in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory”
did
not
subject
you
to
the
same
regulations
that
are
applicable
to
all
other
citizens
of
the
territory.
justice
abe
fortas
you
take
that
position?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
a
regulation
that
we're
here
talking
about,
a
regulation
which
is
applicable
to
everybody
by
its
terms
and
your
complaint
is,
that
it
has
a
different
impact
on
the
indians.
but
what
is
there
in
the
treaty
that
recognizes
that
particular
right
of
the
indians
to
have
fishing
rights
that
are
more
favorable
than
those
of
the
other
citizens
of
the
territory.
i'm
asking
you
a
very
elementary
and
fundamental
question,
but
this
is
not
like
some
of
the
other
indian
situations
in
the
language
of
this
treaty.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
like
some
of
the
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
--
let's
assume
you've
got
all
the
rights
that
are
specified
in
these
treaty.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
there
in
this
treaty
that
commits
the
united
states
to
assure
to
you
rights,
privileges
or
prerogatives
that
are
superior
to
those
of
other
people
of
the
former
territory,
now
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
what's
the
word
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out:
what
is
the
word?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
the
common
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
this
treaty
said,
as
i
understand
it
is
that,
the
indians
are
going
to
stay
on
the
reservation,
but
they
can
fish
anywhere,
they
have
fished,
they've
been
accustomed
to
fishing
even
if
those
other
places
are
in
private
possession,
or
you
have
to
go
with
private
lands,
private
property
to
get
to
them,
but
that
your
fishing
rights
in
those
other
places
are
in
common
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
territory.
now,
that's
why
i
read
this
treaty
and
if
you
disagree
with
that,
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me.
in
other
words,
the
indians,
in
return
for
this
tremendous
transfer,
this
transfer
of
tremendous
acrage
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
different
matter
though.
first,
we
have
to
find
out
what
treaty
says.
i
know
there
are
lots
of
other
considerations,
but
this
treaty
says,
“indians
are
going
to
stay
on
the
reservation
except
that
they
may
fish
wherever
they've
been
accustomed
to
fish
in
common
with
other
people
in
the
territory
and
you
can
even
go
across
privately
owned
land
to
do
that.”
now,
what
you're
saying
here
is,
as
i
understand
that
is
that,
in
common
with
the
other
people
of
the
territory
does
not
mean
that
you
can
be
subjected
to
rules,
regulations,
and
statutes
of
the
state
of
washington
anyway,
applicable
to
everybody
else
in
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
is
where
i
have
difficulty
because
i
--
so
far
as
the
treaty
is
concerned,
because
i
see
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
treaty
that
would
support
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
mr.
martin
as
statutes
and
regulations
at
the
state
of
washington
although
in
terms
they
are
applicable
to
indians
and
non-indians,
in
fact,
there
is
an
indian
effect.
their
impact
on
the
indians
is
much
more
severe
than
it
is
on
the
other
services,
who
have
a
right
in
common
with
the
indians?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martin,
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
a
little
different
thing?
what
is
the
effect
or
possible
effect
of
the
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
i
noticed
reference
to
regulation
adopted
by
the
secretary
which
i
take
it
has
not
been
implemented?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
would
he
have
power
in
your
opinion
to
supersede
the
regulations
and
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
for
this
purpose
not
only
with
respect
to
the
indians,
but
also
with
respect
to
fishing
regulations
generally
in
the
sound?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
regulation
at
the
issue
has
no
possible
help
to
us
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
next
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
relating
to
that
is
just
exactly
what
does
the
government
mean
by
the
proposal
in
its
brief?
what
do
you
think
as
practical
matter
or
as
a
specific
matter
ought
to
be
the
mandate
of
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
your
term
“brought
up”,
i
don't
want
to
be
rude
but
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
insist
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
this
court
ought
to
do
the
right
thing.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
do
you
have
a
more
specific
idea?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
would
you
do
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
reverse
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
position
goes
a
little
further
than
that
because
you
say
that
too
that
unless
the
state
so
regulates
that
entire
fishery
that
enough
fish
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
to
permit
the
indians
to
catch
a
“reasonable
number”
and
to
permit
perpetuation
of
the
run
then
the
state
cannot
impose
any
regulation
on
the
indians?
justice
abe
fortas
but
taking
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
you,
you
say
not
merely
that
the
state
can
regulate
the
number
that
the
indians
take
and
the
state
must
let
the
indians
take
everything,
take
fish
above
the
number
necessary
to
maintain
the
run.
you
do
say
that,
but
you
also
say
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
state
as
a
condition
precedent
to
imposing
this
obligation
on
the
indians,
so
to
regulate
the
entire
fishery,
as
to
make
certain
in
ordinary
circumstances
that
enough
fish
will
come
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
so
that
the
indians
--
so
that
indians
could
let
some
through
to
perpetuate
the
run
and
also
they
indians
would
have
a
reasonable
number
for
themselves.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
have
to
find
reasonable
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
wondering
is
whether
we're
getting
into
somewhat
the
same
situation
we
have
in
wisconsin
case.
i
think
you
are
about
to
get
to
that
menominee
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
the
state
said
the
federal
government
ought
to
relieve
them
of
the
burden
of
taking
care
of
the
indian
rights
and
the
federal
government
said,
“well,
they
are
entitled
to
rights”
certainly
but
the
state
is
required
to
accept
the
burden.
now,
are
we
in
one
of
those
kind
of
binds
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that.
is
that
the
number
of
fish
that
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
total
bar
show
the
number
of
fish
that
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
indians
and
then
number
of
fish
that
escaped,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
government's
point
is
that
you
just
turn
letting
enough
fish
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup.
that's
a
very
rough
and
inaccurate
statement
of
him,
but
that
will
suffice
to
insight
you
to
respond?
justice
abe
fortas
that
didn't
quite
add
because
add
because
your
adversary
say
that
the
state
of
washington
is
giving
the
indians
one
horse
and
one
rabbit
deal
that
instead
of
the
right
being
shared
in
common
with
other
citizens
by
reason
of
the
manner
of
regulation,
the
inadequate
regulation
of
commercial
fisheries,
you
are
not
giving
the
indians
anything
like
a
share
in
common.
that's
the
position
as
i
understand
it
in
saying
that
nominally,
because
you
say,
yes,
of
course,
you
can
fish
there
along
with
non-indians,
but
that
that
what
you've
done
is
to
deprive
that
right
of
any
substance
by
failing
to
make
sure
that
that
an
adequate
supply
of
fish
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
fresh
water?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
did
they
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
this,
some
of
or
part
of
your
argument.
statutes
are
set
out
in
your
brief,
aren't
they
on
pages
8
and
9?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
statute
prohibits
netting
in
the
waters
of
the
state.
that's
a
key
phrase,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
means
only
fresh
waters,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
and
there
must
be
some
provision
which
i
don't
see
it
here
which
permits
your
department
of
fisheries
to
make
exceptions
to
that,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what's
a
columbia
river?
how
did
they
permit
commercial
netting
in
the
columbia
river?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
the
state
does
permit
commercial
netting
in
salt
water?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
the
--
and
you
say
that
there's
a
limitation
on
that
in
terms
of
number
of
days
which
it
might
be
done,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that
might
be
fine
but
i
suppose
the
indians,
one
of
the
indian
statement
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
fish
at
customary
places
by
the
medicine
creek
treaty
and
that
then
the
state
comes
along
and
says,
“you
can't
fish
at
all
because
can't
--
net
at
all
here
in
fresh
water
for
conservation
reasons”
but
at
the
same
time,
the
state
permits
a
commercial
fisheries
to
net
in
the
salt
water.
now,
both
of
them
result
in
the
reduction
of
fish
population.
and
there
are
regulations
and
restrictions
with
respect
to
commercial
fisheries
and
the
question
that
we've
been
pursuing
here
as
i
understand
it,
is
why
can't
there
be
a
comparable
commercial
--
comparable
regulations
with
respect
to
the
indians'
use
of
nets.
now,
may
be
they
can't
be
in
terms
of
fish
taken,
but
can't
there
be
in
terms
of
some
reasonable
arrangements
with
respect
to
days
and
what
not?
the
fish
that
the
commercial
fisheries
catch,
don't
go
back
and
spawn.
may
be
some
of
them
are
on
their
way
back
from
having
spawn
but
others,
i
suppose,
are
on
their
way
to
the
river
to
spawn
and
that
matter
where
the
fish
is
apprehended
if
it
doesn't
get
to
it
spawning
place,
it
doesn't
spawn,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
is
it
your
contention
that
this
is
evenhanded
and
that
the
indians
are
not
being
regulated
more
drastically
than
the
commercial
fisheries?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
we're
pursuing
here
because
i'm
not
at
all
sure,
indians
have
a
right
to
pursue
their
fishing
at
customary
places.
customary
place
here
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
when
you
say
you
can't
do
it
at
the
same
time
you
permit
the
commercial
fisheries
to
use
nets
and
you
subject
them
to
regulation.
the
question
is
--
are
you
taking
your
interpretation
of
the
treaty
on
that
basis,
are
you
really
giving
the
indians
equivalent
or
equal
treatment
with
the
non-indians?
that's
a
question
and
it
is
somewhat
affected
by
practical
consideration
whether
you
could
subject
the
indians
to
comparable
regulations
–
that
is
in
terms
of
days
or
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
assuming
your
construction
which
is
that
this
is
a
“right
in
common”,
that
is
to
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
fish
there,
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state,
but
that
the
regulation
must
--
within
human
exacted
to
you
than
no
more,
they
even
handed
in
its
operation
on
the
indians
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
non-indians
on
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
public
regulation
about
salmon,
that
you
have
about
steelhead
trout,
i
can
understand
that
as
i
understand
on
steelhead
trout,
they
can
be
taken
only
by
hook
and
line
by
anybody.
justice
abe
fortas
and
here,
what
you
say
is
that
the
indians
can't
net.
nobody
can
net
in
fresh
water.
i
mean,
the
indians
can't
net
at
all
per
se
if
they
don't
have
any
particular
status
with
respect
to
salt
water
and
as
practical
matter
they
don't
engage
in
that
kind
of
commercial
fishing.
but
you
say
that
the
commercial
fisheries
can
net
out
in
salt
water
and
it's
arguable.
i'm
not
saying
anything
more
than
that
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
it's
arguable;
arguable
that
that
is
not
the
equality
of
treatment.
justice
abe
fortas
has
the
state
ever
attempted
to
make
any
contract
or
agreement
with
the
indians
here
and
get
federal
action
so
as
to
supersede
the
treaty
or
substitute
an
amendment
of
the
treaty
that
provide
some
substitute
right
for
the
indians
here,
whether
or
not
strictly
the
--
whatever
may
be
the
strict
construction
of
the
treaty?
because
if
you
start
of
with
the
conclusion,
i'm
not
saying
that
i
do
but
that's
what
this
litigation
is
about
fundamentally,
you
start
off
with
the
conclusions
that
the
indians
have
a
right
here
and
that
that
right
is
being
impaired
by
the
regulation.
the
fact
that
the
regulation
may
be
highly
desirable
and
i
think
you
made
what
sounds
to
me
at
the
moment
like
a
noble
almond
(ph)
case
to
that
effect,
but
that
that
kind
of
irrelevant
consideration.
probably,
you
start
off
with
the
conclusion
that
the
treaty
does
confer
a
right
on
the
indians
and
the
state
is
totally
depriving
the
indians
of
that
right
totally,
then
it's
a
very
difficult
case.
but
was
there
some
reference
to
another
situation
which
the
states
have
provided
the
indians
with
gear
and
boats
so
that
they
could
engage
in
salt
water
fishing?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
by
way
of
modification
of
the
treaty?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
these
treaties
can
be
modified
or
superseded
by
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
yes,
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
has
that
been
attempted?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
had
there
been
any
effort
to
obtain
an
amendment
so
far
as
this
treaty
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
referred
to
in
the
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
biologically
sound
to
--
would
it
be
biologically
sound
to
set
some
for
the
state
to
fix
such
certain
number
of
days
during
which
time
the
indians
may
fish?
they
use
nets
in
fresh
water?
justice
abe
fortas
at
any
time?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
cause
--
upsets
the
fish?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
any
difference
between
the
effect
of
the
indian
catch
and
the
non-indian
catch
on
the
columbia
river?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
what
difference
is
it
though
in
the
biological
cycle
of
the
salmon
whether
it's
caught
by
indian
or
non-indian?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
point
you're
making?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
--
on
the
columbia
river
are
they
not
regulated?
are
they
doing
something
that
non-indians
can't
do?
or
is
this
–
or
is
your
point
just
that
indians
are
catching
more
fish?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
they
doing
something
that
non-indians
can't
do,
cannot
do?
justice
abe
fortas
now
how
much
of
that
million
odd
pounds
is
counted
for
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
because
if
i
understand
it,
this
case
is
not
being
presented
anyway
on
the
theory
that
indians
ought
to
catch
less
and
non-indian
commercial
fisheries
ought
to
catch
more.
i
mean
to
say
that
that's
proposition
one
why
it's
kind
of
a
remote.
and
the
issues
here
and
the
question
is
whether
in
areas
where
indians
are
claiming
treaty
rights,
they
are
properly
claiming
treaty
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
--
whether
the
fish
had
been
caught
by
indians
on
one
hand
and
non-indians
on
the
other
hand,
both
of
them
being
subjected
to
the
same
regulation?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
oregon
would
also
--
you're
saying
that
oregon
would
also
apply
that
same
regulation
to
non-indians.
are
you
saying
that
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
why
don't
you
make
your
own
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
state
against
archer?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
embarrass
you
but
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
got
say
about
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
we
stand
now,
whatever
the
basis
might
have
been,
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
has
held
that
the
state
cannot
by
its
hunting
regulations
in
a
way
affect
the
rights
of
the
indians.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
the
only
way
you
suggest
of
handling
that
case
is
for
us
to
establish
a
concrete
doctrine
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
gathered
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
indians
--
did
the
indians
still
--
there
is
still
a
reservation
in
existence
except
as
an
abstract
conception?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
indians
respectively?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
a
reservation
exists,
and
it
exists
conceptually
and
not
in
terms
of
land
ownership?
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
concede
that
that
applies
to
the
puyallup
reservation?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
they
--
if
the
puyallup
indians
wanted
to
fish
upstream
on
the
puyallup
river
within
what
you
submit
as
a
reservation,
you
would
had
the
same
problem
with
which
we're
dealing
now?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
we
decided
that
this
treaty
did
not
give
the
indians
the
rights
for
which
you
contend,
how
many
indians
would
be
directly
affected?
do
you
or
somebody
here
said
the
only
one
who
is
endangered,
as
i
understand
it,
was
kind
of
fishing
don't
to
much
more
than
a
100
in
number.
justice
abe
fortas
off
the
way?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
fish
in
this
way?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
talking
only
about
the
puyallup
now?
