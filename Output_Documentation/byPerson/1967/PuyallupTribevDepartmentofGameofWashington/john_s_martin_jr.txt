mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
that
it
should
be
made
clear
that
we
are
concerned
here
with
two
separate
cases:
one
in
which
there
was
a
fairly
extensive
record,
that
is
the
puyallup
case;
and
there
is
nisqually
case,
which
was
based
on
a
somewhat
stipulated
record.
and
although
there
are
approximately
400
indians,
who
would
be
affected
directly
by
this
case,
the
principles
that
this
court
will
announce
in
this
case
will
affect
more
than
15,000
other
indians
in
the
pacific
northwest
who
have
similarly
guaranteed
rights
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
in
accordance
with
other
treaties
between
their
tribe
and
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
there
are
a
great
number
of
them
do.
i
think
there
may
be
some
particular
reservation
rights,
which
say
don't,
but
there
are
primarily
the
treaties
do
contain.
our
language,
which
is
in
all
respects
identical
with
this.
as
we
view
the
case,
we
cannot
support
the
position
taken
by
mr.
tanner
here
that
the
indians
are
totally
free.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
we
have
set
forth
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
in
a
footnote
to
our
original
memorandum,
which
was
submitted
at
the
time
this
case
was
on
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
set
forth
the
treaties
involved
and
they
are
set
forth
at
footnote
3
of
our
memorandum
at
that
time.
now,
my
best
recollection
is
that
all
those
treaties
contain
language
which
is
if
not
identical
quite
similar
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
to
that
which
we
have
here.
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
support
the
position
which
is
taken
by
mr.
tanner
that
there
is
no
right
in
the
state
in
any
instance
to
regulate
fishing
by
the
indians.
however,
i
think
that
it
is
a
complicated
problem.
i
think
that
we
have
to
start
certainly
with
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
also
with
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
now
this
court
has
never
decisively
ruled
on
the
particular
issue
presented
by
this
case,
but
it
has
in
a
number
of
case
and
that
particularly
the
winans
case,
recognized
that
when
these
treaties
were
made,
the
indians
did
enjoy
and
were
guaranteed
a
somewhat
special
right
even
though
it
was
to
be
a
right
in
common,
it
was
a
somewhat
special
right
which
was
of
a
different
nature
than
that
which
the
ordinary
citizen
of
the
territory
would
enjoy.
and
i
think
really
the
problem
which
this
case
presents
is
one
of
determining
where
the
burden
of
conservation
should
be
placed
in
a
particular
case.
i
think
you
have
to
the
outset
concede
that
neither
the
indians
in
1854
or
the
representatives
of
the
federal
government
that
time
anticipated
that
things
would
develop
to
a
point
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
impose
conservation
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
fish
that
could
be
taken.
but
i
think
a
good
starting
point
to
determine
how
the
burden
of
that
conservation
is
to
be
apportioned
has
to
be
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
entered
into.
now,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
in
the
puyallup
case
by
doctor
teller,
who
was
an
anthropologist
and
it
appears
at
pages
184,
185
of
the
record,
in
which
he
sets
forth
and
stated
that
at
the
time
this
treaty
was
entered
into,
there
was
no
commercial
fishing
of
any
significance
in
this
area
except
that
of
the
indians.
the
indians
did
fish
and
they
fish
not
only
for
their
own
subsistence
but
also
for
fish
which
they
then
bartered
with
people
down
the
coast
and
with
settlers
down
the
coast
and
with
the
hudson
bay
company.
indeed,
in
the
archives
there
is
a
letter
of
governor
stevens
to
the
commissioner
of
indians
affairs,
talking
about
this
provision
in
this
particular
treaty
and
unfortunately,
we
have
not
set
it
out
in
our
brief
but
i
can,
i'm
sure,
obtain
copies
and
would
submit
them
to
the
court.
for
i
think
it's
significant
what
governor
stevens
who
would
negotiated
this
treaty
with
the
indians
had
to
say
about
the
nature
of
the
fishing
and
the
rights
of
that
time.
i'm
talking
about
the
indians
of
puget
sound
is
that
they
form
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
the
trade
of
the
sound.
many
are
good
laborers
and
are
employed
in
families,
vessels,
lumber
yards,
lumber
mills
and
on
farms.
they
catch
most
of
our
fish,
supplying
not
only
our
people
with
clams
and
oysters
but
salmon
to
those
who
pure
and
export
it
what
they
call
small
patches
of
potatoes,
their
principal
food
is
fish
and
roots
and
berries.
then
it
goes
out
to
say,
the
provisions
as
to
reserves,
as
to
taking
of
fish,
pasturing
animals
and
gathering
roots
and
berries
had
strict
reference
to
their
conditions
as
above.
so
it's
clear
that
at
the
time
that
this
particular
treaty
was
entered
into,
the
indians
were
engaged
in
commercial
fishing.
they
were
in
fact
the
only
people
in
this
area
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
and
they
--
this
provision
was
inserted
in
the
treaty
to
protect
their
right,
to
continue
to
engage
in
commercial
fishing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'm
sure
that's
true,
i'm
still
true
today.
i
think
that
the
next
important
thing
to
turn
to
is
what
has
caused
the
change
and
condition
which
now
requires
the
imposition
of
conservation
laws.
i
think
the
clear
answer
today
is
that
a
large
commercial
fishery
has
grown
out
in
the
puget
sound
and
in
the
higher
state
of
washington
and
it
is
the
taking
of
these
fish
by
the
commercial
fishermen,
not
the
taking
of
fish
by
the
indians
which
requires
the
imposition
of
conservation
measures.
one
of
the
exhibits,
i
understand
at
the
court
below
was
a
washington
state
of
department
of
fisheries
report,
the
73rd
annual
report
and
this
is
the
year
1963,
which
i
take
it
was
the
most
recent
available
at
that
time
and
in
that
report,
there
are
statistics
as
to
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
commercial
fisheries
and
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
indians
an
it
is
clear
from
that
report,
for
example
on
the
state
of
washington
as
a
whole,
there
were
in
the
year
1963
9,311,763
salmon
taken.
of
that
total
fish,
815,000
were
taken
by
indians.
similarly
with
regards
to
puget
sound,
that
area
alone
again
the
total
fish
taken
was
7,608,434
where
the
indians
again
took
less
than
10%
of
that,
taking
658,394.
so
it
seems
that
the
need
for
conservation
has
arisen.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
what
that
would
work
out
in
a
dollar
value.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
treaty,
again
starting
with
the
proposition
that
nobody
recognized
at
that
time
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
conservation
problem,
but
i
do
think
that
clear
invocation
of
the
treaty
was
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
shared
right,
the
right
to
fish.
and
i
think
a
clear
implication
from
that
fact
is
that
neither
the
indian
nor
the
other
settlers
would
have
the
power
either
to
take
all
of
the
fish
or
to
destroy
the
resource
by
excessive
fishing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
that
i
disagree
with
mr.
tanner.
however,
i
do
think
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
recognized
in
which
the
court
below
has
not
recognized
is
that
the
indians
did
have
a
particular
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
and
it
seems
for
us
unreasonable
for
the
court
to
say
that
we
have
decided
because
there
is
a
large
scale
commercial
fishery.
we
have
decided
there
must
be
conservation
and
so
we
will
prohibit
all
kinds
of
fishing
or
commercial
fishing
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
to
be
indian.
it
seems
to
me
that
type
of
attitude
does
not
recognize
that
the
indians
had
a
right.
this
is
where
they've
always
fish,
this
was
where
they
continued
to
fish.
it
seems
to
me
unreasonable
to
say
that
if
we
guarantee
the
indians
the
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
accustomed
ground,
we
were
carving
out
an
exception
which
said,
“of
course,
if
the
other
settlers
fish
out
in
the
sound
and
take
all
of
the
fish,
then
we'll
have
to
apply
our
conservation
laws
to
you
and
your
fishing
will
have
to
be
eliminated.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
this
extreme
and
isolation
to
say
we're
excluding
everybody
so
we
can
exclude
the
indians.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
total
fishery
and
this
happens
to
be
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
for
the
indians
and
this
is
where
we
guaranteed
them
the
right
to
fish.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
what
you
have
to
come
to
here
is
a
view
that
overlooks
the
entire
fishery
and
it
says
that
when
the
entire
fishery
presents
a
need
for
conservation
because
so
many
fish
were
being
taken
by
that
fishery,
then
i
think
some
accommodation
has
to
be
made
as
to
who
should
bear.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
washington
can
do
and
i
think
perhaps
we
took
out
of
the
context
of
this
particular
situation,
if
we
would
dealing
with
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
alright
i
will
try
it
in
the
context
of
this
situation.
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case,
since
the
thing
that
is
causing
a
need
for
conservation
is
the
large
scale
commercial
fishery
which
is
going
on
out
here
in
puget
sound.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
not
causing
a
need
for
conservation.
the
indians
haven't
been
doing
it.
it's
been
going
on
out
in
the
sound.
it
seems
to
me
that
before
the
state
can
come
and
regulate
the
indians,
they
have
to
show
that
they
have
made
that
fishery,
which
is
taking
the
fish
it
seems
that
there
is
where
the
conservation
should
be
applied.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
you
could
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
thing
in
the
record
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
a
possibility
(voice
overlap)
but
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
that
--
let's
put
it
the
other
way.
suppose
the
state
were
to
curtail
all
fishing
in
puget
sound
so
that
all
the
fish
got
back
to
their
breed
rivers.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
to
the
mouth
of
the
river.
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
state
to
apply
to
the
indians
as
well
as
the
other
citizens
of
the
state.
whatever
necessary
restriction
had
to
be
imposed
to
allow
reasonable
escapement,
but
i
think
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
state
hasn't
taken
the
position
of
trying
to
make
some
reasonable
accommodation
to
the
right
of
the
indian,
but
it
instead
said,
we
are
going
to
make
you
bear
entire
brunt
of
conservation.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
attitude
adequately
conforms
to
the
rights
that
were
guaranteed
to
these
indians
when
they
signed
the
treaty.
and
i
think
that
this
is
clear
also
in
the
testimony
in
the
case.
doctor
hamilton,
who
has
his
phd
in
zoology
and
fisheries,
testified
as
a
witness
to
this
trial
and
he
said
that
it
is,
in
effect
in
his
testimony
on
these
pages
at
178
and
179
of
the
appendix
in
no.
247,
the
effect
of
his
testimony
was
that
as
far
as
conservation
is
concerned,
whether
you
restrict
fishing
in
the
sound
or
at
the
river,
it's
basically
a
political
question
for
what
is
important
is
that
fish
get
through.
it
is
not
better
conservation
to
allow
all
the
fishing
in
the
sound
and
then
totally
prohibit
the
fishing
in
the
river.
that
would
seem
from
the
other
expert
testimony
in
the
record,
that
really
might
be
conservation
if
you
were
to
prohibit
all
commercial
fishing
until
the
fish
got
to
their
particular
river
because
each
river's
dock
has
it's
own
particular
breed.
and
it's
really
not
until
they
get
to
the
actual
river
itself,
that
you
know
how
the
stock
for
that
river
is
going
to
form
and
what
the
need
may
be
to
conserve
at
that
point?
but
the
state
has
taken
the
position
that
they're
going
to
allow
this
commercial
fishery
to
exist
in
the
puget
sound.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
to
put
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
black,
merely
to
fish
with
the
net
i
think
avoids
the
issue
because
to
fish
with
the
net
is
the
only
way
you
can
fish
commercially
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
what
they're
claiming.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
should
tell
the
state
of
washington
is
that
the
indians
have
a
peculiar
and
a
federally
guaranteed
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
which
may
be
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
common
with
mr.
justice
douglas
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
of
the
entire
fishery.
the
indians
are
not
asking
in
effect
or
perhaps
how
you
take
that
back
in
view
of
mr.
tanner's
statement
but
we
would
say
that
the
indians
are
not
entitled
to
all
the
fish
of
the
fish
run
in
either
of
the
puyallup
or
nisqually
river,
but
if
the
non-indian
fishermen
want
to
fish
in
puget
sound
rather
than
in
the
river,
it
seems
to
me
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
nobody
has
the
right
to
destroy
the
fish
run
and
we
are
certainly
not
arguing
for
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
they
are
not
in
the
same
parity
with
the
indians
because
i
don't
think
they
have
any
peculiar
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
i
would
do
in
common
with
is
this,
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
i
don't
for
a
minute
forget
it.
but
i
think
you
do
what
you
can
isolate
the
stream
where
the
indians
have
always
enjoyed
their
right
to
fish
where
we
guaranteed
that
they
would
continue
to
have
the
right
to
fish.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
indians,
at
the
time
they
signed
that
treaty,
felt
that
they
were
going
to
--
their
right
to
fish
in
that
river
was
going
to
be
extinguished
by
non-indians
taking
every
fish
in
the
sound.
suppose
you
had
a
commercial
fishery,
which
could
drop
a
net
in
puget
sound
and
take
every
fish
before
it
got
back
to
the
river,
i
think
the
indians
would
have
a
right
to
sue
to
enjoin
that
fishing
because
yes,
it's
common
but
it's
common
in
the
sense
of
i
think,
perhaps,
you
look
at
the
sense
of
two
people.
the
indians
want
to
fish
where
they
have
always
fished
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground.
the
non-indian,
who
is
regulated,
and
the
state
speaks
for
that
question,
he
can
fish
either
in
common
with
the
indian
in
that
river
or
he
can
go
into
the
sound
and
take
his
fish
there,
his
share.
there's
to
be
a
sharing
of
the
fish,
but
nobody
it
seems
to
me
should
be
allowed
to
take
--
neither
sides
should
be
allowed
to
take
all
and
i
don't
think
you
can
defeat
the
indian's
right
to
fish
in
the
river.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
would
but
at
the
same
time,
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
reality
and
say
that
the
indian
had
the
right
to
hunt,
you
could
then
prohibit
the
indian
from
using
a
bow
and
arrow
or
knife
or
a
gun
and
say
that
he
can
run
after
the
dear
and
throw
rocks
at
them.
i
think
that
these
people
at
the
time
were
engaged
in
commercial
fishing.
they
weren't
just
spears.
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
there
is,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
anything
comparable
with
regard
to
the
puget
sound
fishery,
but
there
is
a
department
of
interior
of
publication
on
a
history
and
development
of
the
fisheries
of
the
columbia
river
and
it
indicates
at
about
the
same
--
during
with
the
same
period
that
they
were
using
wares
and
together
with
fish
baskets
which
had
the
same
effect
as
the
net
fishery
would
have.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
numbers,
no.
in
percentages,
it
was
almost
a
hundred
percent
were
being
taken
by
the
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
i
think,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
are
none
as
far
as
i
know.
i
have
not
seen
any
gross
number.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
one
approach
that
can
be
taken.
i
think
that
at
the
same
time,
we
--
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
to
the
indians
that
you
are
going
to
be
limited
to
the
methods
that
existed
at
that
time
whereas
other
people
be
allowed
to
fish
by
other
methods
because
among
other
things,
just
a
commercial
value
with
everybody
had
a
fish
at
the
–
where
the
indians
had
been
fishing
then
you
have
a
limited
supply
of
fish
and
i
suppose
fish
would
be
more
valuable
per
fish
than
if
you
have
big
vessels
going
out
with
huge
nets
pulling
in
thousands
of
fish
where
then
few
hundred
fish
the
indians
might
have
caught
don't
have
the
same
type
of
value.
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
everybody
else
can
progress,
but
the
indian
fishery
has
to
suffer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
--
there
have
been
a
number
of
problems
in
this
field
partly
because
there
had
been
no
definitive
guidelines
as
to
just
what
the
authority
of
the
state
to
regulate
indian
fishing
rights
were.
the
state
of
idaho,
like
for
example,
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
no
right.
this
treaty
guarantees
the
indians
an
absolute
right
to
fish
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
and
so
there
was
a
problem
existing
which
hopefully
will
be
solved
by
this
court's
decision
in
these
cases.
but
the
secretary,
in
trying
to
work
out
some
of
these
difficulties,
the
secretary,
i
think,
recognized
among
other
things
that
no
existing
indians
should
be
permitted
to
fish
in
such
a
way
that
will
destroy
the
runs.
even
assuming
that
non-indians
didn't
have
the
right,
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
secretary's
part
to
conserve
this
asset,
even
if
it's
an
indian
asset
for
future
generations
of
indians.
these
regulations
had
been
adopted
in
an
attempt
to
provide
some
method
of
regulation.
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
the
congress
were
to
decide
or
legislate
in
this
area
that
the
fact
that
there
are
treaty
rights
to
be
protected,
would
give
them
under
missouri
versus
holland
a
rationale,
the
right
to
enact
legislation.
i
think
the
secretary
has
somewhat
--
his
regulations
might
come
within
the
same
type
of
power.
i
admit
they
create
certain
problems,
but
among
other
things,
he
is
also
trying
to
develop
system
that
will,
insofar
as
their
–
the
indians
that
would
be
treated
differently
when
fishing
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground,
there
would
be
some
method
of
identifying
the
indians;
identification
of
indian
gear,
some
method
of
determining
who
are
treaty
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
presents
a
fairly
difficult
question.
i
think
he
would
definitely
have
the
power
if
congress
were
to
enact
a
statute
giving
him
that
power.
the
question
is
whether
on
his
general
power
to
regulate
indian
to
fish
could
be
construed
that
broadly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
presents
certain
problems
from
the
standpoint
of
his
power
but
i
do
think
that
the
extent
of
his
right
to
regulate,
in
my
mind,
doesn't
differ
significantly
from
the
extent
of
the
state
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
the
indians
have
a
right,
which
is
protected
from
either
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government.
as
to
what
type
of
action
should
be
taken
to
enforce
the
regulation,
whether
it
should
be
done
through
the
state
or
the
federal
government
used
to
be
a
different
question.
i
think
the
question
that
this
court
has
to
reach
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
extent
of
the
indian
right?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
both
the
government
and
all
the
parties
to
this
case
would
be
happy
if
this
court
could
work
out
a
simple
test
that
deals
with
when
the
indians
or
how
far
the
indian
rights
will
be
protected.
but
i
don't
think
it
lends
itself
to
that
type
of
solution.
i
think
the
indispensable
test
that
mr.
knodel
has
talked
about
seems
to
me
to
imply
that
everybody
is
fishing
but
the
indians
must
be
excluded
before
you
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
but
my
suggestion
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
recognize
the
indians
haven't
guaranteed
a
special
right
to
fish
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
which
may
be
reasonably
regulated
by
the
state,
but
only
if
the
states
can
show
that
they
have
exercised
their
regulation
throughout
the
fishery
and
that
the
indians
are
only
being
asked
to
bear
a
proportion
of
the
conservation
regulation
which
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
this
case?
i
would
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
reverse
the
case
on
the
ground
that
the
state
has
not
shown,
and
this
is
all
of
the
expert
testimony
of
the
state
in
this
case
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
the
indians
have
no
right
to
fish
in
these
rivers
that
has
to
be
protected.
so,
i
would
reverse
this
case
and
vacate
the
injunction
because
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
shown
in
this
case
a
need
to
limit
that
the
indian
fishery
is
what's
causing
the
depletion
of
the
fish.
when
the
indians
are
taking
10%
of
the
fish,
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
say
to
them
it
is
your
fishing
that
has
to
stop.
that's
what
i
would
do
in
this
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
no.
i
suppose
that
on
the
equal
protection
--
the
thing
that
has
to
protected
to
the
indians
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
except
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
there's
a
difference,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
what
you
don't
have
in
your
equal
protection
argument
is
the
indians'
right
to
fish
at
this
place.
certainly,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
violate
the
equal
protection
to
say
the
indians,
you
as
everyone
else
have
to
go
fish
in
the
sound,
but
i
think
it
does
violate
the
treaty
to
say
to
the
indians:
“you,
as
everyone
else,
have
to
go
to
fish
in
the
sound”
because
the
indians
in
the
treaty,
which
we
guaranteed,
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
fish
at
these
locations
and
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
necessary
becomes
a
very
difficult
word.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
do
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
context
of
showing
that
the
indians
are
bearing
only
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
their
fair
share
of
any
regulation.
not
that
you
have
a
commercial
fishery
being
allowed
which
takes
nine
--
about
a
million
fish
and
you're
not
allowing
the
indians
to
take
any
of
it.
i
think
that's
the
problem
in
this
case
and
that's
why
the
judgment
here
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
to
be
looked
up
in
the
terms
of
how
many
fish
are
you
letting
back
to
the
river?
are
you
letting
enough
fish
get
back
to
the
river
to
give
the
indians
a
reasonable
share
of
the
fish
and
plus
enough
for
spawning
purposes
or
are
you
saying
to
the
indians
that
every
fish
that
we
let
get
back
to
the
river
has
to
go
through?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
unfair
in
the
second
case,
you
say
to
the
indians,
“you
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
conservation”.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
can
show
that
they're
allowing
a
reasonable
amount
of
fish
to
get
back
to
the
river
for
indian
fishery
and
they're
allowing
the
indians
to
use
reasonable
methods
to
catch
their
fish
here
or
the
fish,
then
they
can
provide
regulations
which
would
prevent
so
that
the
indians
could
not
merely
just,
as
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
before,
just
taking
double
the
amount
of
fish.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
implicit
in
your
question,
if
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
the
assumption.
let
us
say
that
something
would
happen,
let's
say
we
had
a
bad
fish
run,
there
was
no
fishing
allowed
on
the
--
completely
eliminate
all
fishing
on
the
sound
and
still
only
100
fish
got
through
because
that's
all
the
fish
they
were.
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case,
that
the
state
can
say
the
indians
are
prohibited
also
(voice
overlap)
because
it's
a
reasonable
apportionment
of
the
burden.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
that
is
a
difficult
concept.
i
do
think
that
the
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
here.
there's
been
no
determination.
there's
been
no
factual
showing.
there
are,
for
examples
statistics
set
forth
in
the
department
of
state
fisheries
report
that
go
back
and
gives
a
history
of
what's
been
taken
out
in
–
years.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
if
it
was
a
regulation
that
limited
all
fishing
for
a
period,
to
let
fish
get
through,
that
would
be
reasonable
because
the
indians
are
not
being
asked
to
bear
any
greater
share
of
the
burden
than
anyone
else.
i
mean
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
is
what
you
--end
up
coming
to
look
at
it
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
not
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
there
are
seasons
that
you
know,
there
are
number
of
regulations
and
i'm
really
can't
speak
unto
mr.
justice
white
as
to
what
it
is
but
it
seems
to
me
what
they've
done
here
is
totally
prohibited
the
indians
from
fishing
the
way
the
--
if
not
exactly,
certainly
similarly
to
the
way
they
were
fishing
as
far
back
as
to
the
time
of
this
treaty
and
have
imposed
the
burden
on
the
indians
when
i
think
that
burden
can
only
be
apportioned
to
the
indians
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
fishing
that
they're
doing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
that
that
is
a
possibility.
i
haven't
really
given
much
thought
to
the
problem.
it
has
been
done,
i
think,
in
regard
to
dams
and
the
building
the
dams
that
there
have
been
–
the
dams
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
know
it
has
been
done
in
that
context
whether
for
this
purpose
–
there
has
been
a
somewhat
different
problem
but
-
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
mr.
claiborne
is
arguing
--
is
the
menominee.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
we
are.
i
don't
think
we
are
arguing
at
all
here
at
least
that
the
federal
government
--
the
state
has
no
power.
i
think
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
state
does
have
a
power
to
regulate
this,
but
the
right
does
exists.
it's
a
federal
right,
but
it
subjects
the
indians
insofar
as
they
exceed
that
federal
right
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state.
i
think
that's
somewhat
similar
position
in
the
menominee
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
if
that
was
the
case,
--
that's
not
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
what
i've
trying
to
urge,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
the
state
of
washington
cannot
attempt
to
regulate
the
indian
fishing
rights
until
they
have
take
that
actually?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that
is
discriminating
the
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
faced
with
having
to
do
that
because
the
state
has
come
in
and
asked
to
enjoin
these
indians
from
exercising
their
treaty
rights
and
this
court,
i
think,
is
empowered
to
say
to
the
court
that
“no,
what
you've
told
them
they
can't
do
is
a
federally
exercised
right
which
you
can't
prohibit.”
now,
i
think
that
you
were
right
that
for
example
were
complaining
that
so
much
fishing
was
being
allowed
out
in
the
sound
that
no
fish
can
get
back
to
the
river,
perhaps
they
would
have
a
right
to
bring
a
suit
and
perhaps
the
secretary
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
may
be
possible
being
secretary
of
interior
in
view
of
his
wide
jurisdiction
and
they
might
have
such
a
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
i
didn't
throw
it
there.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
state
went
into
court
and
sought
an
injunction,
it
was
at
that
point,
it
was
a
long
toss,
but
that's
when
they
start
throwing
it
in
your
lap
and
the
state
has
done
something
which
they
cannot
do
because
they
interfered
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
exactly
our
contention.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
that
it
should
be
made
clear
that
we
are
concerned
here
with
two
separate
cases:
one
in
which
there
was
a
fairly
extensive
record,
that
is
the
puyallup
case;
and
there
is
nisqually
case,
which
was
based
on
a
somewhat
stipulated
record.
and
although
there
are
approximately
400
indians,
who
would
be
affected
directly
by
this
case,
the
principles
that
this
court
will
announce
in
this
case
will
affect
more
than
15,000
other
indians
in
the
pacific
northwest
who
have
similarly
guaranteed
rights
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
in
accordance
with
other
treaties
between
their
tribe
and
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
there
are
a
great
number
of
them
do.
i
think
there
may
be
some
particular
reservation
rights,
which
say
don't,
but
there
are
primarily
the
treaties
do
contain.
our
language,
which
is
in
all
respects
identical
with
this.
as
we
view
the
case,
we
cannot
support
the
position
taken
by
mr.
tanner
here
that
the
indians
are
totally
free.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
we
have
set
forth
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
in
a
footnote
to
our
original
memorandum,
which
was
submitted
at
the
time
this
case
was
on
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
set
forth
the
treaties
involved
and
they
are
set
forth
at
footnote
3
of
our
memorandum
at
that
time.
now,
my
best
recollection
is
that
all
those
treaties
contain
language
which
is
if
not
identical
quite
similar
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
to
that
which
we
have
here.
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
support
the
position
which
is
taken
by
mr.
tanner
that
there
is
no
right
in
the
state
in
any
instance
to
regulate
fishing
by
the
indians.
however,
i
think
that
it
is
a
complicated
problem.
i
think
that
we
have
to
start
certainly
with
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
also
with
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
now
this
court
has
never
decisively
ruled
on
the
particular
issue
presented
by
this
case,
but
it
has
in
a
number
of
case
and
that
particularly
the
winans
case,
recognized
that
when
these
treaties
were
made,
the
indians
did
enjoy
and
were
guaranteed
a
somewhat
special
right
even
though
it
was
to
be
a
right
in
common,
it
was
a
somewhat
special
right
which
was
of
a
different
nature
than
that
which
the
ordinary
citizen
of
the
territory
would
enjoy.
and
i
think
really
the
problem
which
this
case
presents
is
one
of
determining
where
the
burden
of
conservation
should
be
placed
in
a
particular
case.
i
think
you
have
to
the
outset
concede
that
neither
the
indians
in
1854
or
the
representatives
of
the
federal
government
that
time
anticipated
that
things
would
develop
to
a
point
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
impose
conservation
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
fish
that
could
be
taken.
but
i
think
a
good
starting
point
to
determine
how
the
burden
of
that
conservation
is
to
be
apportioned
has
to
be
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
entered
into.
now,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
in
the
puyallup
case
by
doctor
teller,
who
was
an
anthropologist
and
it
appears
at
pages
184,
185
of
the
record,
in
which
he
sets
forth
and
stated
that
at
the
time
this
treaty
was
entered
into,
there
was
no
commercial
fishing
of
any
significance
in
this
area
except
that
of
the
indians.
the
indians
did
fish
and
they
fish
not
only
for
their
own
subsistence
but
also
for
fish
which
they
then
bartered
with
people
down
the
coast
and
with
settlers
down
the
coast
and
with
the
hudson
bay
company.
indeed,
in
the
archives
there
is
a
letter
of
governor
stevens
to
the
commissioner
of
indians
affairs,
talking
about
this
provision
in
this
particular
treaty
and
unfortunately,
we
have
not
set
it
out
in
our
brief
but
i
can,
i'm
sure,
obtain
copies
and
would
submit
them
to
the
court.
for
i
think
it's
significant
what
governor
stevens
who
would
negotiated
this
treaty
with
the
indians
had
to
say
about
the
nature
of
the
fishing
and
the
rights
of
that
time.
i'm
talking
about
the
indians
of
puget
sound
is
that
they
form
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
the
trade
of
the
sound.
many
are
good
laborers
and
are
employed
in
families,
vessels,
lumber
yards,
lumber
mills
and
on
farms.
they
catch
most
of
our
fish,
supplying
not
only
our
people
with
clams
and
oysters
but
salmon
to
those
who
pure
and
export
it
what
they
call
small
patches
of
potatoes,
their
principal
food
is
fish
and
roots
and
berries.
then
it
goes
out
to
say,
the
provisions
as
to
reserves,
as
to
taking
of
fish,
pasturing
animals
and
gathering
roots
and
berries
had
strict
reference
to
their
conditions
as
above.
so
it's
clear
that
at
the
time
that
this
particular
treaty
was
entered
into,
the
indians
were
engaged
in
commercial
fishing.
they
were
in
fact
the
only
people
in
this
area
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
and
they
--
this
provision
was
inserted
in
the
treaty
to
protect
their
right,
to
continue
to
engage
in
commercial
fishing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'm
sure
that's
true,
i'm
still
true
today.
i
think
that
the
next
important
thing
to
turn
to
is
what
has
caused
the
change
and
condition
which
now
requires
the
imposition
of
conservation
laws.
i
think
the
clear
answer
today
is
that
a
large
commercial
fishery
has
grown
out
in
the
puget
sound
and
in
the
higher
state
of
washington
and
it
is
the
taking
of
these
fish
by
the
commercial
fishermen,
not
the
taking
of
fish
by
the
indians
which
requires
the
imposition
of
conservation
measures.
one
of
the
exhibits,
i
understand
at
the
court
below
was
a
washington
state
of
department
of
fisheries
report,
the
73rd
annual
report
and
this
is
the
year
1963,
which
i
take
it
was
the
most
recent
available
at
that
time
and
in
that
report,
there
are
statistics
as
to
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
commercial
fisheries
and
the
number
of
fish
taken
by
the
indians
an
it
is
clear
from
that
report,
for
example
on
the
state
of
washington
as
a
whole,
there
were
in
the
year
1963
9,311,763
salmon
taken.
of
that
total
fish,
815,000
were
taken
by
indians.
similarly
with
regards
to
puget
sound,
that
area
alone
again
the
total
fish
taken
was
7,608,434
where
the
indians
again
took
less
than
10%
of
that,
taking
658,394.
so
it
seems
that
the
need
for
conservation
has
arisen.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
what
that
would
work
out
in
a
dollar
value.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
treaty,
again
starting
with
the
proposition
that
nobody
recognized
at
that
time
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
conservation
problem,
but
i
do
think
that
clear
invocation
of
the
treaty
was
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
shared
right,
the
right
to
fish.
and
i
think
a
clear
implication
from
that
fact
is
that
neither
the
indian
nor
the
other
settlers
would
have
the
power
either
to
take
all
of
the
fish
or
to
destroy
the
resource
by
excessive
fishing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
that
i
disagree
with
mr.
tanner.
however,
i
do
think
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
recognized
in
which
the
court
below
has
not
recognized
is
that
the
indians
did
have
a
particular
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
and
it
seems
for
us
unreasonable
for
the
court
to
say
that
we
have
decided
because
there
is
a
large
scale
commercial
fishery.
we
have
decided
there
must
be
conservation
and
so
we
will
prohibit
all
kinds
of
fishing
or
commercial
fishing
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
to
be
indian.
it
seems
to
me
that
type
of
attitude
does
not
recognize
that
the
indians
had
a
right.
this
is
where
they've
always
fish,
this
was
where
they
continued
to
fish.
it
seems
to
me
unreasonable
to
say
that
if
we
guarantee
the
indians
the
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
accustomed
ground,
we
were
carving
out
an
exception
which
said,
“of
course,
if
the
other
settlers
fish
out
in
the
sound
and
take
all
of
the
fish,
then
we'll
have
to
apply
our
conservation
laws
to
you
and
your
fishing
will
have
to
be
eliminated.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
this
extreme
and
isolation
to
say
we're
excluding
everybody
so
we
can
exclude
the
indians.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
total
fishery
and
this
happens
to
be
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
for
the
indians
and
this
is
where
we
guaranteed
them
the
right
to
fish.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
what
you
have
to
come
to
here
is
a
view
that
overlooks
the
entire
fishery
and
it
says
that
when
the
entire
fishery
presents
a
need
for
conservation
because
so
many
fish
were
being
taken
by
that
fishery,
then
i
think
some
accommodation
has
to
be
made
as
to
who
should
bear.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
washington
can
do
and
i
think
perhaps
we
took
out
of
the
context
of
this
particular
situation,
if
we
would
dealing
with
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
alright
i
will
try
it
in
the
context
of
this
situation.
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case,
since
the
thing
that
is
causing
a
need
for
conservation
is
the
large
scale
commercial
fishery
which
is
going
on
out
here
in
puget
sound.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
not
causing
a
need
for
conservation.
the
indians
haven't
been
doing
it.
it's
been
going
on
out
in
the
sound.
it
seems
to
me
that
before
the
state
can
come
and
regulate
the
indians,
they
have
to
show
that
they
have
made
that
fishery,
which
is
taking
the
fish
it
seems
that
there
is
where
the
conservation
should
be
applied.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
you
could
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
thing
in
the
record
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
a
possibility
(voice
overlap)
but
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
that
--
let's
put
it
the
other
way.
suppose
the
state
were
to
curtail
all
fishing
in
puget
sound
so
that
all
the
fish
got
back
to
their
breed
rivers.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
to
the
mouth
of
the
river.
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
state
to
apply
to
the
indians
as
well
as
the
other
citizens
of
the
state.
whatever
necessary
restriction
had
to
be
imposed
to
allow
reasonable
escapement,
but
i
think
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
state
hasn't
taken
the
position
of
trying
to
make
some
reasonable
accommodation
to
the
right
of
the
indian,
but
it
instead
said,
we
are
going
to
make
you
bear
entire
brunt
of
conservation.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
attitude
adequately
conforms
to
the
rights
that
were
guaranteed
to
these
indians
when
they
signed
the
treaty.
and
i
think
that
this
is
clear
also
in
the
testimony
in
the
case.
doctor
hamilton,
who
has
his
phd
in
zoology
and
fisheries,
testified
as
a
witness
to
this
trial
and
he
said
that
it
is,
in
effect
in
his
testimony
on
these
pages
at
178
and
179
of
the
appendix
in
no.
247,
the
effect
of
his
testimony
was
that
as
far
as
conservation
is
concerned,
whether
you
restrict
fishing
in
the
sound
or
at
the
river,
it's
basically
a
political
question
for
what
is
important
is
that
fish
get
through.
it
is
not
better
conservation
to
allow
all
the
fishing
in
the
sound
and
then
totally
prohibit
the
fishing
in
the
river.
that
would
seem
from
the
other
expert
testimony
in
the
record,
that
really
might
be
conservation
if
you
were
to
prohibit
all
commercial
fishing
until
the
fish
got
to
their
particular
river
because
each
river's
dock
has
it's
own
particular
breed.
and
it's
really
not
until
they
get
to
the
actual
river
itself,
that
you
know
how
the
stock
for
that
river
is
going
to
form
and
what
the
need
may
be
to
conserve
at
that
point?
but
the
state
has
taken
the
position
that
they're
going
to
allow
this
commercial
fishery
to
exist
in
the
puget
sound.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
to
put
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
black,
merely
to
fish
with
the
net
i
think
avoids
the
issue
because
to
fish
with
the
net
is
the
only
way
you
can
fish
commercially
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
what
they're
claiming.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
should
tell
the
state
of
washington
is
that
the
indians
have
a
peculiar
and
a
federally
guaranteed
right
to
fish
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground
which
may
be
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
common
with
mr.
justice
douglas
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
of
the
entire
fishery.
the
indians
are
not
asking
in
effect
or
perhaps
how
you
take
that
back
in
view
of
mr.
tanner's
statement
but
we
would
say
that
the
indians
are
not
entitled
to
all
the
fish
of
the
fish
run
in
either
of
the
puyallup
or
nisqually
river,
but
if
the
non-indian
fishermen
want
to
fish
in
puget
sound
rather
than
in
the
river,
it
seems
to
me
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
nobody
has
the
right
to
destroy
the
fish
run
and
we
are
certainly
not
arguing
for
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
they
are
not
in
the
same
parity
with
the
indians
because
i
don't
think
they
have
any
peculiar
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
i
would
do
in
common
with
is
this,
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
i
don't
for
a
minute
forget
it.
but
i
think
you
do
what
you
can
isolate
the
stream
where
the
indians
have
always
enjoyed
their
right
to
fish
where
we
guaranteed
that
they
would
continue
to
have
the
right
to
fish.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
indians,
at
the
time
they
signed
that
treaty,
felt
that
they
were
going
to
--
their
right
to
fish
in
that
river
was
going
to
be
extinguished
by
non-indians
taking
every
fish
in
the
sound.
suppose
you
had
a
commercial
fishery,
which
could
drop
a
net
in
puget
sound
and
take
every
fish
before
it
got
back
to
the
river,
i
think
the
indians
would
have
a
right
to
sue
to
enjoin
that
fishing
because
yes,
it's
common
but
it's
common
in
the
sense
of
i
think,
perhaps,
you
look
at
the
sense
of
two
people.
the
indians
want
to
fish
where
they
have
always
fished
at
their
usual
and
accustomed
ground.
the
non-indian,
who
is
regulated,
and
the
state
speaks
for
that
question,
he
can
fish
either
in
common
with
the
indian
in
that
river
or
he
can
go
into
the
sound
and
take
his
fish
there,
his
share.
there's
to
be
a
sharing
of
the
fish,
but
nobody
it
seems
to
me
should
be
allowed
to
take
--
neither
sides
should
be
allowed
to
take
all
and
i
don't
think
you
can
defeat
the
indian's
right
to
fish
in
the
river.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
would
but
at
the
same
time,
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
reality
and
say
that
the
indian
had
the
right
to
hunt,
you
could
then
prohibit
the
indian
from
using
a
bow
and
arrow
or
knife
or
a
gun
and
say
that
he
can
run
after
the
dear
and
throw
rocks
at
them.
i
think
that
these
people
at
the
time
were
engaged
in
commercial
fishing.
they
weren't
just
spears.
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
there
is,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
anything
comparable
with
regard
to
the
puget
sound
fishery,
but
there
is
a
department
of
interior
of
publication
on
a
history
and
development
of
the
fisheries
of
the
columbia
river
and
it
indicates
at
about
the
same
--
during
with
the
same
period
that
they
were
using
wares
and
together
with
fish
baskets
which
had
the
same
effect
as
the
net
fishery
would
have.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
numbers,
no.
in
percentages,
it
was
almost
a
hundred
percent
were
being
taken
by
the
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
i
think,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
are
none
as
far
as
i
know.
i
have
not
seen
any
gross
number.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
one
approach
that
can
be
taken.
i
think
that
at
the
same
time,
we
--
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
to
the
indians
that
you
are
going
to
be
limited
to
the
methods
that
existed
at
that
time
whereas
other
people
be
allowed
to
fish
by
other
methods
because
among
other
things,
just
a
commercial
value
with
everybody
had
a
fish
at
the
–
where
the
indians
had
been
fishing
then
you
have
a
limited
supply
of
fish
and
i
suppose
fish
would
be
more
valuable
per
fish
than
if
you
have
big
vessels
going
out
with
huge
nets
pulling
in
thousands
of
fish
where
then
few
hundred
fish
the
indians
might
have
caught
don't
have
the
same
type
of
value.
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
everybody
else
can
progress,
but
the
indian
fishery
has
to
suffer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
--
there
have
been
a
number
of
problems
in
this
field
partly
because
there
had
been
no
definitive
guidelines
as
to
just
what
the
authority
of
the
state
to
regulate
indian
fishing
rights
were.
the
state
of
idaho,
like
for
example,
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
no
right.
this
treaty
guarantees
the
indians
an
absolute
right
to
fish
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
and
so
there
was
a
problem
existing
which
hopefully
will
be
solved
by
this
court's
decision
in
these
cases.
but
the
secretary,
in
trying
to
work
out
some
of
these
difficulties,
the
secretary,
i
think,
recognized
among
other
things
that
no
existing
indians
should
be
permitted
to
fish
in
such
a
way
that
will
destroy
the
runs.
even
assuming
that
non-indians
didn't
have
the
right,
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
secretary's
part
to
conserve
this
asset,
even
if
it's
an
indian
asset
for
future
generations
of
indians.
these
regulations
had
been
adopted
in
an
attempt
to
provide
some
method
of
regulation.
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
the
congress
were
to
decide
or
legislate
in
this
area
that
the
fact
that
there
are
treaty
rights
to
be
protected,
would
give
them
under
missouri
versus
holland
a
rationale,
the
right
to
enact
legislation.
i
think
the
secretary
has
somewhat
--
his
regulations
might
come
within
the
same
type
of
power.
i
admit
they
create
certain
problems,
but
among
other
things,
he
is
also
trying
to
develop
system
that
will,
insofar
as
their
–
the
indians
that
would
be
treated
differently
when
fishing
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground,
there
would
be
some
method
of
identifying
the
indians;
identification
of
indian
gear,
some
method
of
determining
who
are
treaty
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
presents
a
fairly
difficult
question.
i
think
he
would
definitely
have
the
power
if
congress
were
to
enact
a
statute
giving
him
that
power.
the
question
is
whether
on
his
general
power
to
regulate
indian
to
fish
could
be
construed
that
broadly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
presents
certain
problems
from
the
standpoint
of
his
power
but
i
do
think
that
the
extent
of
his
right
to
regulate,
in
my
mind,
doesn't
differ
significantly
from
the
extent
of
the
state
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
the
indians
have
a
right,
which
is
protected
from
either
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government.
as
to
what
type
of
action
should
be
taken
to
enforce
the
regulation,
whether
it
should
be
done
through
the
state
or
the
federal
government
used
to
be
a
different
question.
i
think
the
question
that
this
court
has
to
reach
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
extent
of
the
indian
right?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
both
the
government
and
all
the
parties
to
this
case
would
be
happy
if
this
court
could
work
out
a
simple
test
that
deals
with
when
the
indians
or
how
far
the
indian
rights
will
be
protected.
but
i
don't
think
it
lends
itself
to
that
type
of
solution.
i
think
the
indispensable
test
that
mr.
knodel
has
talked
about
seems
to
me
to
imply
that
everybody
is
fishing
but
the
indians
must
be
excluded
before
you
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
but
my
suggestion
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
recognize
the
indians
haven't
guaranteed
a
special
right
to
fish
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground
which
may
be
reasonably
regulated
by
the
state,
but
only
if
the
states
can
show
that
they
have
exercised
their
regulation
throughout
the
fishery
and
that
the
indians
are
only
being
asked
to
bear
a
proportion
of
the
conservation
regulation
which
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
this
case?
i
would
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
reverse
the
case
on
the
ground
that
the
state
has
not
shown,
and
this
is
all
of
the
expert
testimony
of
the
state
in
this
case
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
the
indians
have
no
right
to
fish
in
these
rivers
that
has
to
be
protected.
so,
i
would
reverse
this
case
and
vacate
the
injunction
because
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
shown
in
this
case
a
need
to
limit
that
the
indian
fishery
is
what's
causing
the
depletion
of
the
fish.
when
the
indians
are
taking
10%
of
the
fish,
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
say
to
them
it
is
your
fishing
that
has
to
stop.
that's
what
i
would
do
in
this
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
no.
i
suppose
that
on
the
equal
protection
--
the
thing
that
has
to
protected
to
the
indians
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
except
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
there's
a
difference,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
what
you
don't
have
in
your
equal
protection
argument
is
the
indians'
right
to
fish
at
this
place.
certainly,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
violate
the
equal
protection
to
say
the
indians,
you
as
everyone
else
have
to
go
fish
in
the
sound,
but
i
think
it
does
violate
the
treaty
to
say
to
the
indians:
“you,
as
everyone
else,
have
to
go
to
fish
in
the
sound”
because
the
indians
in
the
treaty,
which
we
guaranteed,
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
fish
at
these
locations
and
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
necessary
becomes
a
very
difficult
word.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
do
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
context
of
showing
that
the
indians
are
bearing
only
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
--
their
fair
share
of
any
regulation.
not
that
you
have
a
commercial
fishery
being
allowed
which
takes
nine
--
about
a
million
fish
and
you're
not
allowing
the
indians
to
take
any
of
it.
i
think
that's
the
problem
in
this
case
and
that's
why
the
judgment
here
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
to
be
looked
up
in
the
terms
of
how
many
fish
are
you
letting
back
to
the
river?
are
you
letting
enough
fish
get
back
to
the
river
to
give
the
indians
a
reasonable
share
of
the
fish
and
plus
enough
for
spawning
purposes
or
are
you
saying
to
the
indians
that
every
fish
that
we
let
get
back
to
the
river
has
to
go
through?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
unfair
in
the
second
case,
you
say
to
the
indians,
“you
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
conservation”.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
can
show
that
they're
allowing
a
reasonable
amount
of
fish
to
get
back
to
the
river
for
indian
fishery
and
they're
allowing
the
indians
to
use
reasonable
methods
to
catch
their
fish
here
or
the
fish,
then
they
can
provide
regulations
which
would
prevent
so
that
the
indians
could
not
merely
just,
as
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
before,
just
taking
double
the
amount
of
fish.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
implicit
in
your
question,
if
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
the
assumption.
let
us
say
that
something
would
happen,
let's
say
we
had
a
bad
fish
run,
there
was
no
fishing
allowed
on
the
--
completely
eliminate
all
fishing
on
the
sound
and
still
only
100
fish
got
through
because
that's
all
the
fish
they
were.
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case,
that
the
state
can
say
the
indians
are
prohibited
also
(voice
overlap)
because
it's
a
reasonable
apportionment
of
the
burden.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
that
is
a
difficult
concept.
i
do
think
that
the
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
here.
there's
been
no
determination.
there's
been
no
factual
showing.
there
are,
for
examples
statistics
set
forth
in
the
department
of
state
fisheries
report
that
go
back
and
gives
a
history
of
what's
been
taken
out
in
–
years.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
if
it
was
a
regulation
that
limited
all
fishing
for
a
period,
to
let
fish
get
through,
that
would
be
reasonable
because
the
indians
are
not
being
asked
to
bear
any
greater
share
of
the
burden
than
anyone
else.
i
mean
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
is
what
you
--end
up
coming
to
look
at
it
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
not
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
there
are
seasons
that
you
know,
there
are
number
of
regulations
and
i'm
really
can't
speak
unto
mr.
justice
white
as
to
what
it
is
but
it
seems
to
me
what
they've
done
here
is
totally
prohibited
the
indians
from
fishing
the
way
the
--
if
not
exactly,
certainly
similarly
to
the
way
they
were
fishing
as
far
back
as
to
the
time
of
this
treaty
and
have
imposed
the
burden
on
the
indians
when
i
think
that
burden
can
only
be
apportioned
to
the
indians
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
fishing
that
they're
doing.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
that
that
is
a
possibility.
i
haven't
really
given
much
thought
to
the
problem.
it
has
been
done,
i
think,
in
regard
to
dams
and
the
building
the
dams
that
there
have
been
–
the
dams
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
know
it
has
been
done
in
that
context
whether
for
this
purpose
–
there
has
been
a
somewhat
different
problem
but
-
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
mr.
claiborne
is
arguing
--
is
the
menominee.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
we
are.
i
don't
think
we
are
arguing
at
all
here
at
least
that
the
federal
government
--
the
state
has
no
power.
i
think
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
state
does
have
a
power
to
regulate
this,
but
the
right
does
exists.
it's
a
federal
right,
but
it
subjects
the
indians
insofar
as
they
exceed
that
federal
right
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state.
i
think
that's
somewhat
similar
position
in
the
menominee
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
if
that
was
the
case,
--
that's
not
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
what
i've
trying
to
urge,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
the
state
of
washington
cannot
attempt
to
regulate
the
indian
fishing
rights
until
they
have
take
that
actually?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that
is
discriminating
the
indians.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
faced
with
having
to
do
that
because
the
state
has
come
in
and
asked
to
enjoin
these
indians
from
exercising
their
treaty
rights
and
this
court,
i
think,
is
empowered
to
say
to
the
court
that
“no,
what
you've
told
them
they
can't
do
is
a
federally
exercised
right
which
you
can't
prohibit.”
now,
i
think
that
you
were
right
that
for
example
were
complaining
that
so
much
fishing
was
being
allowed
out
in
the
sound
that
no
fish
can
get
back
to
the
river,
perhaps
they
would
have
a
right
to
bring
a
suit
and
perhaps
the
secretary
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
may
be
possible
being
secretary
of
interior
in
view
of
his
wide
jurisdiction
and
they
might
have
such
a
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
i
didn't
throw
it
there.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
state
went
into
court
and
sought
an
injunction,
it
was
at
that
point,
it
was
a
long
toss,
but
that's
when
they
start
throwing
it
in
your
lap
and
the
state
has
done
something
which
they
cannot
do
because
they
interfered
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
exactly
our
contention.
