mr.
knodel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
are
aborigines
to
this
area,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
do
they
seek
here?
do
they
seek
the
unlimited
rights
to
market
this
fish
at
anytime
of
the
year
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
recognize
the
right
of
the
state
to
put
seasons
on
the
indians
so
far
as
their
commercial
fishing
is
concerned
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
assume
that
by
your
net
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
that
the
spawning
up
the
river
would
be
destroyed.
now,
we
just
assume
that
as
a
fact.
what
would
happen
to
the
salmon
run
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
wiped
out
and
there
would
be
no
fishing
for
anybody
because
salmon
won't
go
up
another
stream
from
that
--
where
they
were
born,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
deny
the
right
to
commercial
fishermen
to
fish
with
nets
in
any
season
of
the
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
state
does
regulate
that,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
mr.
tanner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
agreed
to
by
all
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
the
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
spawning
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
that
there
were,
among
your
twelve
clients
or
whatever
member
you
mentioned,
some
who
are
not
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
all
members
of
the
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
i
just
like
to
know
your
clients.
you
say
some
of
them
are
of
a
tribe
and
some
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
they
acquire
their
interest
in
the
fish
that
common
to
the
indians
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
purchase?
chief
justice
earl
warren
only
33?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
to
the
destruction
of
the
species?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
what
i
asked.
you
said
they
could
take
every
single
fish
that
goes
up
there.
would
you
say
that
even
to
the
fact,
even
to
the
degree
that
would
ruin
the
spawning
grounds
of
the
salmon
in
that
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
commercial
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
is
there
commercial
trading
in
these
groups?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
round
figures?
you
must
have
some
idea
about
how
much
it
amounts
to
in
a
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
12?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understand
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
the
extent
of
your
commercial
fishing
in
that
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
there
are
only
a
hundred
fish
come
up
that
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
your
commercial
fishermen
fish
the
same
as
other
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
because
their
operation
is
smaller
than
the
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can't
tell
us
what
those
relationships
are,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
outside
of
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
in
the
rational
waters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
when
they
get
in
the
sound,
do
you
have
that
kind
of
depredation
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
other
states
control
the
fishing
inside
of
their
water
ways,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
san
francisco
bay?
don't
they
have
seasons
on
salmon?
the
state
have
seasons
on
salmon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
don't
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
they
have
it
of
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
valley
--
in
san
joaquin
river
and
the
principal
ones;
one
running
from
the
north,
one
running
from
the
south
into
the
common
bay
and
they
control
the
salmon
in
there,
they
control
the
striped
bass
and
all
other
fish.
they
have
seasons
for
them
and
they
have
actually
outlawed
all
commercial
fishing
in
there.
i
would
think
they
can
do
that
in
that
state,
why
can't
they
do
it
to
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
the
only
reason
i
asked
that
is
because
you
said
that
the
state
could
not
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
not
talking
about
a
practical
matter.
we're
talking
about
legally
if
you
are
just
saying
that
that
it's
your
experience
that
they
can't
do
it
practically,
that's
one
thing
but
i
thought
we're
trying
to
determine
here
whether
they
could
do
it
legally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
'well,
if
they
could
do
it
legally,
could
they
bind
the
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
says
in
its
memorandum
that
the
indians,
who
have
been
guaranteed
by
federal
treaties
“the
right
of
taking
fish
at
all
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory”
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
guaranteed
them
that
right
“in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory.
”now,
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
were
you
referring
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
interpretation
of
this
language.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
is
the
indian
commercial
fishing
there?
you
gave
us
a
number
of
fish,
800,000,
what
does
that
represent
in
dollars,
do
you
have
any
idea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
being
a
little
more
specific
on
this
question?
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
fish
that
the
indians
were
taking
commercially
were
destroying
the
spawning
grounds
of
the
fish
in
those
two
rivers
and
that
to
do
that
would
destroy
the
fish
run
in
the
south.
what
power,
if
any,
would
the
state
of
washington
have
to
remedy
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
we
treat
it
in
jsut
another
way
instead
of
treating
it
in
numbers
of
fish;
that
we
treat
it
according
to
the
times
of
the
year
that
they
go
up
there
to
spawn
and
would
the
state
of
washington
have
the
right
to
establish
seasons
at
which
all
fish
could
go
up
there
because
they're
going
up
to
spawn
and
in
that
way
limit
the
number
that
are
caught?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
washington
have
the
right
to
condemn
this
right
of
the
indians
in
order
to
let
the
fish
run
continue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
coniff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
over
30
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
what
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
38
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
allow
a
net
fishing
in
other
parts
of
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.

versus
department
of

of

mr.
coniff,
i
believe
you
were
arguing,
you
may
continue
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
coniff,
i
wonder
if
before
you
get
to
that,
if
you
can
tell
us
just
what
rights
under
the
fishing
rights
the
indians
have
under
the
treaty
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
nothing
about
the
commercial
fishing
on
those
notes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
contention
that
you
are
administering
this
law
against
using
the
fish
nets
discriminatorily?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
being
administered
all
over
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
size
is
it
--
any
difference
between
nets
of
different
sizes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
no
time
of
the
year
when
it
could
be
said
that
at
that
time,
it
is
reasonable
as
a
spawning
season
and
that
during
that
spawning
season
only
the
nets
cannot
be
used
rather
than
to
say
that
that
no
time
throughout
the
year
could
they
fish
there
with
such
nets?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
that
might
be
another
thing
but
i'm
speaking
about
biologically
and
scientifically,
could
they
not
limit
it
to
the
spawning
season?
and
after
all,
the
only
time
you
would
really
be
interested
in
is
the
spawning
season,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
limit
put
on
the
amount
of
fish
that
commercial
fishermen
can
take
in
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
regulated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
274
days,
how
many
could
they
catch
during
that
time,
all
they
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
the
state
limit
commercial
fishing
to
280
odd
days
a
year
rather
than
365?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
why
did
they
put
the
274
in
the
first
place
instead
of
365?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
that
question
was
if
you
can
put
an
arbitrary
date
like
that
on
the
commercial
fishing,
why
couldn't
you
put
similar
date
on
the
gill
nets
at
the
mouth
of
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
commercial
fishermen
take
them
in
the
holding
of
waters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
they
fix
out,
by
months
or
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
allow
any
fishing
at
all,
any
commercial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnston?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
commercial
fishing
for
274
days
a
year
and
some
of
those
days,
the
fish
are
on
their
way
through
the
sound
up
to
the
rivers
to
spawn,
you're
cutting
down
the
number
too
that
are
going
up
their
to
spawn,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
never
come
back
if
you
catch
them
before
they
get
there
either,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
give
all
that
to
the
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
is
also
a
question
when
they
catch
the
fish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
there
could
be
no
season
of
the
year
when
this
could
be
done
without
serious
damage
to
the
spawn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
obligation
to
--
in
the
event
that
it
breeches
the
treaty
to
these
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
obligations
to
the
indians
whatsoever
in
the
event
that
it,
the
state
breeches
the
treaty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
“any
right”
that
you
--
any
obligation.
i
don't
say
it's
a
question
of
damages
but
you
have
any
obligation
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
indians
under
that
treaty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
your
position
here
on
the
--
as
far
as
that
treaty
is
concerned,
that
the
indians
have
no
rights
under
that
treaty
at
the
present
time;
that
the
state
could
make
any
regulations
that
it
wants
in
the
interest
of
conservation,
and
not
withstanding
the
treaty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
much
of
what
were
talking
about
extraneous
if
that
issue
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
there
is
any
--
there
are
any
rights
that
they
have
a
right
to
protect
as
against
the
state
of
washington
and
you
lose,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
suppose
the
state
of
washington
should
decides
that
it
also
interfered
with
spawning,
and
if
there
was
any
fishing
at
all
on
these
rivers
that
go
through
the
indian
reservation,
could
they
say
that
no
one
could
fish
there
and
then
justified
on
the
ground
that
they're
dealing
with
the
indians
same
as
the
other,
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
use
gill
nets
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
regulate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
have,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
mere
commercial
fishing
that
people
[inaudible]
of
it,
two
or
three
or
four
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
there
be
any
difference
in
your
position
if
the
tribe
was
doing
this
gill
net
fishing
as
a
communal
matter
instead
of
individuals
as
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
these
individuals
have
any
right
under
the
treaty,
different
to
that
which
is
the
right
of
the
tribe
from
mixed
up
about
to
suing
the
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
one
number
of
the
tribe
has
the
right
to
go
catch
all
the
fish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
case
in
anyway
fight
between
the
several
commercial
indians
and
the
fishing
[inaudible]
and
other
commercial
fishers
in
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
someone
say
yesterday
that
there
were
about
nine
million
salmon
caught
up
there
in
a
season
and
that
about
eighty
thousand
of
them
were
caught
by
the
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
that
the
salmon
run
in
the
sound
has
decreased
remarkably
in
the
last
few
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
has
it
decreased?
well,
if
you
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
really,
though
this
isn't
the
interest
of
the
commercial
fishery,
doesn't
it
to
stop
the
indians
from
fishing
at
round
the
river
within
fish
to
run
for
your
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
necessarily
from
the
indian
fishing
or
might
be
from
274
days
a
year
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
why
then
did
they
drop
the
274
to
80?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
have
the
same
thing
in
the
sound
which
you
have
here?
your
fish
is
dwindling
because
of
the
method
of
fishing
and
the
number
of
fish
they
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
the
only
legal
[inaudible]
is
that
we
have
a
long
commercial
fishing
season.
they're
bound
to
catch
fish
along
their
way
up
to
spawn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
stop
them,
if
you
don't
stop
them
from
taking
those
fish
when
they
are
their
way
up
to
spawn,
why
don't
you
contribute
very
greatly
to
the
same
condition
that
you
say
will
exist
if
the
indians
are
permitted
to
gill
net
on
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
i
know
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
woodworth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you're
in
complete
agreement
with
counsel
from
washington.
you
said
a
moment
ago,
as
i
understood
you
that
the
indians
should
be
subject
to
a
modicum,
a
modicum
of
regulation.
and,
counsel
for
washington,
as
i
understood
them,
said
that
they
would
–
that
they
have
absolutely
no
rights
to
be
free
of
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you
are
here
to
inform
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
a
legal
matter
and
you
only
talked
of
a
biologist
since
you've
been
here.
you
haven't
said
anything
about
the
rights
of
the
indians
under
the
treaty
whether
they
have
none,
whether
they
have
some
except
that
you
said
they
should
be
subject
to
a
modicum
of
regulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
notwithstanding
treaty
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
have
a
season
for
the
indians
as
well
as
the
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this,
may
i
ask
that
was
because
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
that
it
was
biologically
wrong
absolutely
to
think
of
seasons
on
the
rivers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
very
tributaries
so,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
whole
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
you're
time
was
expired
but
mr.
jones,
who
is
here
from
idaho,
isn't
not?
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
close,
mr.
jones
if
you
wish
and
counsel
may
have
additional
five
minutes
if
they
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
in
the
puyallup
reservation,
the
indian
reservation
now?
is
it
that
not
just
indians
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
property
sold
and
exchanged
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
is
that
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1280?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
what's
included
within
that
red
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
looks
like
it
covers
a
lot
of
miles
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
knodel,
if
under
the
treaty,
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
rights
--
the
communal
rights
of
the
tribe
and
the
rights
of
an
individual,
who
is
a
puyallup
indian,
to
go
out
and
engage
in
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
these
individuals
who
are
commercial
fishermen,
because
they
are
puyallup
indians,
have
the
right
to
exercise
all
of
the
rights
that
the
tribe,
as
a
communal
group,
can
exercise
under
the
treaty?
by
that,
i
tell
you
why
i
asked
a
question.
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
never
went
through
the
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
on
the
reservation,
they
could
do
anything
they
want
insofar
as
fishing
is
concerned?
i
suppose
there,
they
would
do
what
is
communal
rights.
the
tribe
could
control
it.
do
you
mean
that
that
would
also
give
the
rights
to
individuals
to
go
out
as
individuals
to
compete
with
other
commercial
fishermen
for
their
own
particular
benefit,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
may
be
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
tribe
so
far
as
the
use
of
the
river
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
the
tribe
get
any
benefit
from
this
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
are
they
interested
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
the
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
restrictions
did
they
put
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
roll
was
approved
by
the
federal
government
that
recognized
as
a
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
this
tribe,
so
called
“tribe”,
been
at
that
time
out
of
this
fishing
by
these
three
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief

mr.
knodel?
chief

earl
warren
but
they
are
aborigines
to
this
area,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
do
they
seek
here?
do
they
seek
the
unlimited
rights
to
market
this
fish
at
anytime
of
the
year
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
recognize
the
right
of
the
state
to
put
seasons
on
the
indians
so
far
as
their
commercial
fishing
is
concerned
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
assume
that
by
your
net
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
that
the
spawning
up
the
river
would
be
destroyed.
now,
we
just
assume
that
as
a
fact.
what
would
happen
to
the
salmon
run
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
wiped
out
and
there
would
be
no
fishing
for
anybody
because
salmon
won't
go
up
another
stream
from
that
--
where
they
were
born,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
deny
the
right
to
commercial
fishermen
to
fish
with
nets
in
any
season
of
the
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
state
does
regulate
that,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
mr.
tanner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
agreed
to
by
all
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
the
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
spawning
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
that
there
were,
among
your
twelve
clients
or
whatever
member
you
mentioned,
some
who
are
not
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
all
members
of
the
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
i
just
like
to
know
your
clients.
you
say
some
of
them
are
of
a
tribe
and
some
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
they
acquire
their
interest
in
the
fish
that
common
to
the
indians
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
purchase?
chief
justice
earl
warren
only
33?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
to
the
destruction
of
the
species?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
what
i
asked.
you
said
they
could
take
every
single
fish
that
goes
up
there.
would
you
say
that
even
to
the
fact,
even
to
the
degree
that
would
ruin
the
spawning
grounds
of
the
salmon
in
that
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
commercial
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
is
there
commercial
trading
in
these
groups?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
round
figures?
you
must
have
some
idea
about
how
much
it
amounts
to
in
a
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
12?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understand
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
the
extent
of
your
commercial
fishing
in
that
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
there
are
only
a
hundred
fish
come
up
that
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
your
commercial
fishermen
fish
the
same
as
other
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
because
their
operation
is
smaller
than
the
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can't
tell
us
what
those
relationships
are,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
outside
of
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
in
the
rational
waters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
when
they
get
in
the
sound,
do
you
have
that
kind
of
depredation
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
other
states
control
the
fishing
inside
of
their
water
ways,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
san
francisco
bay?
don't
they
have
seasons
on
salmon?
the
state
have
seasons
on
salmon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
don't
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
they
have
it
of
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
valley
--
in
san
joaquin
river
and
the
principal
ones;
one
running
from
the
north,
one
running
from
the
south
into
the
common
bay
and
they
control
the
salmon
in
there,
they
control
the
striped
bass
and
all
other
fish.
they
have
seasons
for
them
and
they
have
actually
outlawed
all
commercial
fishing
in
there.
i
would
think
they
can
do
that
in
that
state,
why
can't
they
do
it
to
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
the
only
reason
i
asked
that
is
because
you
said
that
the
state
could
not
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
not
talking
about
a
practical
matter.
we're
talking
about
legally
if
you
are
just
saying
that
that
it's
your
experience
that
they
can't
do
it
practically,
that's
one
thing
but
i
thought
we're
trying
to
determine
here
whether
they
could
do
it
legally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
'well,
if
they
could
do
it
legally,
could
they
bind
the
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
says
in
its
memorandum
that
the
indians,
who
have
been
guaranteed
by
federal
treaties
“the
right
of
taking
fish
at
all
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
stations
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory”
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
guaranteed
them
that
right
“in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory.
”now,
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
were
you
referring
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
interpretation
of
this
language.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
is
the
indian
commercial
fishing
there?
you
gave
us
a
number
of
fish,
800,000,
what
does
that
represent
in
dollars,
do
you
have
any
idea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
being
a
little
more
specific
on
this
question?
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
fish
that
the
indians
were
taking
commercially
were
destroying
the
spawning
grounds
of
the
fish
in
those
two
rivers
and
that
to
do
that
would
destroy
the
fish
run
in
the
south.
what
power,
if
any,
would
the
state
of
washington
have
to
remedy
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
we
treat
it
in
jsut
another
way
instead
of
treating
it
in
numbers
of
fish;
that
we
treat
it
according
to
the
times
of
the
year
that
they
go
up
there
to
spawn
and
would
the
state
of
washington
have
the
right
to
establish
seasons
at
which
all
fish
could
go
up
there
because
they're
going
up
to
spawn
and
in
that
way
limit
the
number
that
are
caught?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
washington
have
the
right
to
condemn
this
right
of
the
indians
in
order
to
let
the
fish
run
continue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
coniff?
chief
justice

over

what?
chief
justice

no,
what
was

--
chief
justice
earl

38
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
allow
a
net
fishing
in
other
parts
of
the

chief
justice

we
will

now.

mr.
coniff,
i
believe
you
were
arguing,
you
may
continue
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
coniff,
i
wonder
if
before
you
get
to
that,
if
you
can
tell
us
just
what
rights
under
the
fishing
rights
the
indians
have
under
the
treaty
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
nothing
about
the
commercial
fishing
on
those
notes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
contention
that
you
are
administering
this
law
against
using
the
fish
nets
discriminatorily?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
being
administered
all
over
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
size
is
it
--
any
difference
between
nets
of
different
sizes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
no
time
of
the
year
when
it
could
be
said
that
at
that
time,
it
is
reasonable
as
a
spawning
season
and
that
during
that
spawning
season
only
the
nets
cannot
be
used
rather
than
to
say
that
that
no
time
throughout
the
year
could
they
fish
there
with
such
nets?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
that
might
be
another
thing
but
i'm
speaking
about
biologically
and
scientifically,
could
they
not
limit
it
to
the
spawning
season?
and
after
all,
the
only
time
you
would
really
be
interested
in
is
the
spawning
season,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
limit
put
on
the
amount
of
fish
that
commercial
fishermen
can
take
in
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
regulated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
274
days,
how
many
could
they
catch
during
that
time,
all
they
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
the
state
limit
commercial
fishing
to
280
odd
days
a
year
rather
than
365?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
why
did
they
put
the
274
in
the
first
place
instead
of
365?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
that
question
was
if
you
can
put
an
arbitrary
date
like
that
on
the
commercial
fishing,
why
couldn't
you
put
similar
date
on
the
gill
nets
at
the
mouth
of
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
commercial
fishermen
take
them
in
the
holding
of
waters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
they
fix
out,
by
months
or
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
allow
any
fishing
at
all,
any
commercial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnston?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
commercial
fishing
for
274
days
a
year
and
some
of
those
days,
the
fish
are
on
their
way
through
the
sound
up
to
the
rivers
to
spawn,
you're
cutting
down
the
number
too
that
are
going
up
their
to
spawn,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
never
come
back
if
you
catch
them
before
they
get
there
either,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
give
all
that
to
the
commercial
fishermen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
is
also
a
question
when
they
catch
the
fish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
there
could
be
no
season
of
the
year
when
this
could
be
done
without
serious
damage
to
the
spawn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
obligation
to
--
in
the
event
that
it
breeches
the
treaty
to
these
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
obligations
to
the
indians
whatsoever
in
the
event
that
it,
the
state
breeches
the
treaty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
“any
right”
that
you
--
any
obligation.
i
don't
say
it's
a
question
of
damages
but
you
have
any
obligation
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
indians
under
that
treaty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
your
position
here
on
the
--
as
far
as
that
treaty
is
concerned,
that
the
indians
have
no
rights
under
that
treaty
at
the
present
time;
that
the
state
could
make
any
regulations
that
it
wants
in
the
interest
of
conservation,
and
not
withstanding
the
treaty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
much
of
what
were
talking
about
extraneous
if
that
issue
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
there
is
any
--
there
are
any
rights
that
they
have
a
right
to
protect
as
against
the
state
of
washington
and
you
lose,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
suppose
the
state
of
washington
should
decides
that
it
also
interfered
with
spawning,
and
if
there
was
any
fishing
at
all
on
these
rivers
that
go
through
the
indian
reservation,
could
they
say
that
no
one
could
fish
there
and
then
justified
on
the
ground
that
they're
dealing
with
the
indians
same
as
the
other,
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
use
gill
nets
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
regulate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
have,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
mere
commercial
fishing
that
people
[inaudible]
of
it,
two
or
three
or
four
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
there
be
any
difference
in
your
position
if
the
tribe
was
doing
this
gill
net
fishing
as
a
communal
matter
instead
of
individuals
as
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
these
individuals
have
any
right
under
the
treaty,
different
to
that
which
is
the
right
of
the
tribe
from
mixed
up
about
to
suing
the
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
one
number
of
the
tribe
has
the
right
to
go
catch
all
the
fish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
case
in
anyway
fight
between
the
several
commercial
indians
and
the
fishing
[inaudible]
and
other
commercial
fishers
in
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
someone
say
yesterday
that
there
were
about
nine
million
salmon
caught
up
there
in
a
season
and
that
about
eighty
thousand
of
them
were
caught
by
the
indians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
that
the
salmon
run
in
the
sound
has
decreased
remarkably
in
the
last
few
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
has
it
decreased?
well,
if
you
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
really,
though
this
isn't
the
interest
of
the
commercial
fishery,
doesn't
it
to
stop
the
indians
from
fishing
at
round
the
river
within
fish
to
run
for
your
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
necessarily
from
the
indian
fishing
or
might
be
from
274
days
a
year
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
why
then
did
they
drop
the
274
to
80?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
have
the
same
thing
in
the
sound
which
you
have
here?
your
fish
is
dwindling
because
of
the
method
of
fishing
and
the
number
of
fish
they
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
the
only
legal
[inaudible]
is
that
we
have
a
long
commercial
fishing
season.
they're
bound
to
catch
fish
along
their
way
up
to
spawn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
stop
them,
if
you
don't
stop
them
from
taking
those
fish
when
they
are
their
way
up
to
spawn,
why
don't
you
contribute
very
greatly
to
the
same
condition
that
you
say
will
exist
if
the
indians
are
permitted
to
gill
net
on
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
i
know
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
woodworth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you're
in
complete
agreement
with
counsel
from
washington.
you
said
a
moment
ago,
as
i
understood
you
that
the
indians
should
be
subject
to
a
modicum,
a
modicum
of
regulation.
and,
counsel
for
washington,
as
i
understood
them,
said
that
they
would
–
that
they
have
absolutely
no
rights
to
be
free
of
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you
are
here
to
inform
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
a
legal
matter
and
you
only
talked
of
a
biologist
since
you've
been
here.
you
haven't
said
anything
about
the
rights
of
the
indians
under
the
treaty
whether
they
have
none,
whether
they
have
some
except
that
you
said
they
should
be
subject
to
a
modicum
of
regulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
notwithstanding
treaty
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
have
a
season
for
the
indians
as
well
as
the
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this,
may
i
ask
that
was
because
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
that
it
was
biologically
wrong
absolutely
to
think
of
seasons
on
the
rivers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
very
tributaries
so,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
whole
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
you're
time
was
expired
but
mr.
jones,
who
is
here
from
idaho,
isn't
not?
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
close,
mr.
jones
if
you
wish
and
counsel
may
have
additional
five
minutes
if
they
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
in
the
puyallup
reservation,
the
indian
reservation
now?
is
it
that
not
just
indians
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
property
sold
and
exchanged
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
is
that
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1280?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
what's
included
within
that
red
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
looks
like
it
covers
a
lot
of
miles
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
knodel,
if
under
the
treaty,
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
rights
--
the
communal
rights
of
the
tribe
and
the
rights
of
an
individual,
who
is
a
puyallup
indian,
to
go
out
and
engage
in
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
these
individuals
who
are
commercial
fishermen,
because
they
are
puyallup
indians,
have
the
right
to
exercise
all
of
the
rights
that
the
tribe,
as
a
communal
group,
can
exercise
under
the
treaty?
by
that,
i
tell
you
why
i
asked
a
question.
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
never
went
through
the
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
on
the
reservation,
they
could
do
anything
they
want
insofar
as
fishing
is
concerned?
i
suppose
there,
they
would
do
what
is
communal
rights.
the
tribe
could
control
it.
do
you
mean
that
that
would
also
give
the
rights
to
individuals
to
go
out
as
individuals
to
compete
with
other
commercial
fishermen
for
their
own
particular
benefit,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
and
may
be
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
tribe
so
far
as
the
use
of
the
river
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
the
tribe
get
any
benefit
from
this
commercial
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
are
they
interested
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
the
fishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
restrictions
did
they
put
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
roll
was
approved
by
the
federal
government
that
recognized
as
a
tribe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
this
tribe,
so
called
“tribe”,
been
at
that
time
out
of
this
fishing
by
these
three
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
