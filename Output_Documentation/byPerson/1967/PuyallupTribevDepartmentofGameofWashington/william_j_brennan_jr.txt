justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
prevail
would
the
effect
be
to
deny
both
sport
fishing
and
commercial
fishing
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
prevail,
all
that
happens
is
that
the
regulation
which
restrict
would
finally
gets
down
there
at
the
mouth
of
the
river,
it
would
not
be
enforced
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
it
amount
to
so
much
that
only
the
indians
can
have
any
fish
–
i
suppose
it
could
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
though
your
position
is
this,
isn't
it
that
if
the
treaty
must
be
interpreted
as
you
said
an
abundant
supply
and
of
abandon
supply
means
that
no
one
else
can
have
any
and
that's
the
consequence
of
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
access
over
their
own
subsistence?
how
do
you
measure
that?
you
said
they've
been
selling
fish
to
settlers
way
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
now,
you
are
not
selling
in
the
settlers
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
going
to
measure
this
access
to
know
where
subsistence
occurred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
answer
is
that
now
your
insistence
is
that
no
state
regulation
can
prevent
the
indians
from
fishing
year
round,
however,
much
they
may
cut
down
on
how
much
fish
they
may
take,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
tanner,
i
gather
--
in
going
and
saying
they
can
take
everything
that
comes
up
the
river.
you
mean
as
well
to
the
exclusion
either
of
sports
fishermen
or
other
commercial
fishermen
further
up
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
does
your
proposition
goes
so
far
as
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
solely
and
exclusively
indian?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
let
me
see,
mr.
martin.
now,
do
i
understand
you,
in
answering
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
say
this,
using
justice
white's
hypothetical
that
a
determination
must
be
made
by
someone
on
what
is
reasonable
as
the
indians'
share,
if
that
turns
out
to
be
a
1000
coming
up
the
river,
a
100
hundred
going
for
spawning
fish
and
the
900
really
being
the
indian
share,
then
up
river,
commercial
and
sports
fishing
and
everything
else
has
so
to
be
regulated
that
there
will
come
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
at
least
a
1000
fish,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
even
if
you're
right
that
the
indian
has
a
special
right,
i'm
sure
the
state
doesn't
argue
that
nevertheless
you
can
favor
the
commercial
sports
fishermen
over
the
indian
or
do
you
argue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
have
no
special
right,
nevertheless,
may
you
so
regulate
these
fisheries
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said
to
give
a
rabbit
to
the
indians
and
horse
to
the
commercial
fishermen,
can
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
you
said
before
your
position
is
they
don't
have
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
asking
you
even
if
we
agreed
that
they
do
not,
you're
certainly
not
suggesting
the
regulation
can
take
the
form
which
discriminates
against
the
indians
in
favor
of
the
other
commercial
fishermen,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
hope
you
touch
on
that
before
you
get
finished?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
your
brief,
the
quote
you
just
read
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
that
document
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
we
were
told
yesterday
that
in
fact,
the
indians
did
market
some
of
their
catch
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
conceded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
i
think,
y6ou
concede
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
the
unlimited
form
of
barter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
tribal
right
may
be
exercised
by
any
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he
does
exercise
it,
what
he
gets
he
keeps
for
himself.
he
doesn't
have
to
share
with
other
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
tell
me
what's
the
record
had
a
lot
about
this
commercial
operations
by
the
three
indians,
are
they
related
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
large
in
operation
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
there
was
a
very
large
operation,
i
asked
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
it
compare
in
proceeds
with
what
the
commercial
fishermen
in
the
area
that
set
aside
for
the
salt
water?
would
they
get
in
the
way
of
proceeds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
this
just
three?
were
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
three
brothers
are
members
of
this
particular
tribe,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
it,
does
that
$128,000
proceed,
does
that
reflect
the
price
for
fish
something
as
we
were
told
earlier?
depending
on
where
you
catch
them,
you
may
get
only
three
to
five
cents
pound
that
you
catch
some
other
places
you
may
get
$35
cents
of
pound?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
this
reflect
sales
of
the
lower
price?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
quality
fish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
take
--
they
take
their
nets
out
to
the
salt
water
means
you
have
to
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
this
tribe
is
not
one
of
those
as
yet.
i
think
the
tribe
has
been
getting
the
subsidy
that
you
mentioned
and
given
the
equipment,
the
boats
and
such,
is
not
this
tribe,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
tribe
that
has
a
subsidy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
some
distance
from
where
we
are?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
the
treaty
cut
across
all
this?
if
in
fact
there
is
a
treaty
that
gives
the
indian
an
off
reservation
right,
doesn't
that
destroy
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
national
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that
the
national
government
then
can't,
by
treaty,
affect
that
regulation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
and
if
this
treaty
gives
this
kind
of
right
to
the
indians,
hasn't
that
destroy
your
argument?
justice
william
