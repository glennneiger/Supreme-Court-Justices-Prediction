mr.
t.
j.
jones

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
only
one
or
two
items
here
that
i
want
to
talk
about
in
view
of
the
shortness
of
the
time
that
i
have.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
all
of
our
opponents
in
the
puyallup's
case,
this
of
course
does
not
include
mr.
tanner
and
his
clients,
the
nisquallies,
here
before
the
court
have
suggested
that
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
july
of
1967
offer
the
best
solution
to
the
problem
of
off
reservation
indian
fishing.
the
states
have
rejected
this
offer
by
the
department
of
interior.
this,
of
course,
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
three
involved
states:
washington,
oregon
and
idaho
have
rejected
the
pro
offered
federal
regulations.
nearly
three
years
ago,
in
july
1965,
the
department
of
interior
circulated
proposed
regulations
almost
identical
to
those
that
were
promulgated
by
the
secretary
in
july
of
last
year.
these
proposed
regulations
were
delivered
to
the
governors
of
the
three
states
with
the
request
that
the
states
support
the
secretary
in
the
adoption,
promulgation
and
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
off
reservation
indian
fishing
regulations.
after
due
consideration,
the
three
states
unanimously
rejected
the
proposed
federal
indian
fishing
regulations
on
the
basis
that
amongst
other
things
that
out
of
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
power
has
not
delegated
to
the
states
by
the
constitution
and
are
prohibited
to
it
by
the
states,
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states,
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people.
that
by
virtue
of
this
amendment,
it
is
historically
been
held
by
this
court
that
title
to
wildlife
resources
insofar
as
you're
capable
of
ownership,
rests
in
the
states
as
a
trustee
thereof
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
citizens
of
the
states,
indian
and
non-indian.
and
therefore,
it's
the
states
took
the
position
that
neither
the
federal
government
nor
the
indians
have
the
power
to
regulate
state
resources.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
this
was
only
with
respect
to
off
reservation,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
no,
it
would
not
carry
to
that
extent.
we
realized
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
indian
country.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
yes,
we
have
to
file
memoranda
to
the
court
on
that
point.
and
the
states
also
took
the
further
position
that
we
did
not
have
the
power
to
convey
title
to
the
state
resources
nor
do
we
have
any
police
powers
and
that
the
supreme
court,
this
very
court,
in
this
regard
had
never
held
that
we,
the
states
lack
the
power
--
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
feel
that
we
have
the
right
insofar
as
the
off
reservation
fishing
is
concerned
to
enact
reasonable
and
necessary
regulations.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
in
common.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
oh!
yes,
assume
naturally
that
the
treaty
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we're
faced
here
with
something
that
actually
has
eroded
over
a
period
of
years.
and,
again,
we
go
back
it
seems
like
always
to
these
cases
and
we
say,
“what
did
the
indians
think
at
this
particular
time?
what
did
we
mean
when
we
treated
with
them?
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
i
had
an
idea
that
would
come
up,
justice
fortas.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
well,
i'm
sure
there's
no
justice
from
the
state
supreme
court
here
so
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
think
that
actually,
our
supreme
court
in
the
archer
case,
mistook
the
intent
of
this
particular
court,
the
u.s.
supreme
court
in
the
decisions
in,
for
example,
seufert
brothers,
winans
and
the
tulee
case.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
very
correct.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
that
would
be
my
fondest
desire
at
the
moment.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
i
think
this
is
the
crux
of
it,
mr.
justice
douglas.
thank
you.
mr.
t.
j.
jones
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
