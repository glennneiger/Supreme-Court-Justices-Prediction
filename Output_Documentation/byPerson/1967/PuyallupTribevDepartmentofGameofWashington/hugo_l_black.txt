justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
the
treaty?
what
language
of
the
treaty?
what
words
of
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
been
reading
it
and
i
can't
find
any
which
seems
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
my
brother
fortas
though
when
i
get
to
section
3,
it
says
“further
--
said
indians
in
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory”.
what
does
that
“in
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
indians
gave
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
common?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
to
determine
how
the
fishing
should
be
done
by
everybody
in
the
state
or
territory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
exactly,
under
this
treaty,
what's
the
government's
position,
the
indians
have
the
right
to
do
here
now
and
what,
how
the
state
of
washington
regulated
them,
if
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
you
disagree
with
mr.
tanner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
mean
by
that
now
that
washington
has
no
power
to
regulate
their
power
to
fish
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
they
have
no
power
to
prevent
their
fishing
commercially
there
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
hey
do
have
power
to
permit
other
people
to
fish?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
can
washington
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wanted
it
in
the
context
of
this
situation
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
not
at
the
indian's
usual
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
what
do
they
say,
they
will
prevent
the
indians
from
doing
it?
is
it
merely
to
fish
with
the
nets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
washington
is
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
washington
is
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
fishing
with
a
net?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
us
to
tell
washington
that
it
can't?
if
it
will
go
ahead
and
do
something
outside
at
other
part,
it
can
prevent
that
fishing
with
the
net?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
usual
and
accustom
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
in
the
context
of
it.
they've
got
a
right
to
fish
with
the
net
at
this
place
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
until
washington
does
something
to
regulate
fishing
outside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
martin,
i
regret
to
ask
you
another
question
[inaudible]
i
have
been
waiting
to
ask
you
this?
it
seems
to
me
like
the
way
you
argue
this
and
i
can't
tell
exactly
how
you
argued,
i
have
to
admit
it,
i
can't
tell
exactly
what
the
state
of
that
–
the
department
of
justice
wants
us
to
do
except
that
you
say
that
the
indians
should
have
a
right
to
take
these
fish
and
to
somebody
it's
just
a
regulation
outside,
so
that
enough
fish
will
get
there
for
them
to
use
their
–
get
their
fish.
now
if
that's
the
case,
whose
duty
is
it
to
regulate
that,
is
it
the
government?
and
if
it's
the
government,
why
does
not
the
attorney
general
has
that
power
and
authority
to
file
a
suit
to
get
that
regulated
as
a
violation
of
the
treaty.
i
gather
from
what
you
are
saying
it's
a
violation
of
the
treaty
because
they
are
not
letting
enough
fish
come
down
for
the
indians
to
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
you
wanted
us
to
tell
washington
(voice
overlap)
that
they
can't
do
that
thing
until
somebody
regulates
that
on
the
outside
so
that
the
fish
get
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
saying
is
that
they
are
regulating
in
such
a
way
that
it
violates
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
that
it
violates
the
treaty,
whose
duty
is
it
to
try
to
get
that
straighten
out?
can
we
do
it
by
vague
interpretations
and
vague
statements
about
what's
reasonable
and
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
have
a
right
to
bring
one?
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
right
to
bring
one
on
the
part
of
the
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
couldn't
be
done?
why
should
it
be
thrown
into
our
lap
in
this
vague
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
didn't
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
by
failing
to
regulate
sufficiently
at
one
place,
they've
taken
it
out
of
their
power
to
regulate
the
indians
at
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
any
net
fishing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
in
the
issue
raised
in
this
case
that
we
have
to
pass
on
at
all
except
one,
whether
as
you
charge,
they
have
been
doing
net
fishing,
rather
as
you
charge
that
violates
a
valid
law
of
the
state
of
washington
and
whether
as
the
injunction
commanded
they
stop
doing
that
fishing,
what
else
do
we
have
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question
would
be,
as
i
see
it
in
from
your
pleading
in
the
injunction,
whether
your
law
against
net
fishing
is
a
bad
law
and
whether
that
from
that
standpoint
whether
you're
barred
from
enforcing
that
law
against
them
because
of
that
special
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
issue
entered
by
the
indians
based
on
the
thesis
of
the
government's
argument
that
the
court
should
canvass
and
consider
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
state
laws
were
bad
because
they
did
not
regulate
the
fishing
better
at
the
part
of
these
waters
that
he
says
they
should
have
regulated
back.
was
that
canvassed
or
considered
by
the
court?
do
we
have
any
basis
on
which
to
reach
a
conclusion
about
those
matters?
it
seems
to
me
like
they
somewhat
complicate
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
rather
you'd
leave
out
those
words.
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
there's
anything
in
this
record
that
would
authorize
us
to
reach
a
conclusion
if
we
desire
to
do
so;
that
the
state
laws
are
bad
because
they
in
some
way
discriminate
and
that
they
do
not
let
enough
fish
come
up
into
the
place
where
the
indians
fish.
is
there
any
mention
in
the
record
on
which
we
can
draw
legitimate
conclusions
on
that
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gathered
from
someone
yesterday
that
it
was
not
the
entire
tribe
can
be
doing
this
fishing,
certain
individuals,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
tribe
get
anything
out
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
a
personal
private
contract
made
by
several
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
more
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
how
did
the
entire
tribe
have
to
be
a
part
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
right
is
being
exercised
by
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
by
the
tribe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
conveyed
their
rights
to
these
indians,
these
two
or
three
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
did
the
others
fish?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
they
do
fish,
but
it's
not
commercial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
means
do
they
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
this
record
from
which
we
can
read
decisions
that
law
is
being
operated
in
such
a
way
that
[inaudible]
fishing
with
nets
that
large
commercial
companies
on
the
outside
who
are
able
to
fish
otherwise
than
which
is
being
given
an
unfair
advantage
over
the
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
three
indian
brothers
get
at
fish
while
the
others
are
fishing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
been
a
law
to
prevent
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
place
where
the
stream
that
if
they
catch
too
many
of
them
before
they
go
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
issue
of
that
kind
canvassed
to
any
extent
whatever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
these
indians
were
denied
their
right
to
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
nets,
what
other
way
of
fishing
is
open
to
them
that
would
be
practical?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
take
their
nets
and
go
at
the
salt
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream?
how
could
they
fish
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
overturn
the
findings
and
conclusion
of
the
court
that
there
is
no
such
tribe
now
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
gone
--
nearly
all
of
them
gone
then
they
married?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
50
people?
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
asking
us
to
--
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
hundred
and
fifty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
live
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
live
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
more
than
a
dozen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
if
this
tribe
has
disappeared
as
a
tribe
that
they
still
have
this
fishing
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
if
this
tribe
has
disappeared
as
the
court
says
they
have,
they
still
have
any
fishing
right?
i
gather
from
the
findings
of
the
court,
while
you
can
identify
a
small
handful
of
people
live
one
place
or
another
as
being
a
bloodline
descent
from
these
indians,
they've
just
disappeared.
they've
mixed
with
the
white
people,
they've
gone
to
the
schools
and
integrated
with
them
and
they
do
not
maintain
any
kind
of
tribal
relationship.
do
you
claim
that
if
that
is
the
situation,
they
still
have
rights
under
this
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
form
of
government
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
court
says
they
have
no
form
of
government,
they
have
no
policemen,
they
have
no
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
they
are
a
part
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
a
state
--
is
a
situation.
congress,
of
course,
alone
has
the
right
to
settle
this
thing
politically.
what
you
seem
to
have
is
a
situation
where
the
indians
have
all
disappeared,
except
a
few
who
wants
some
fishing
rights;
that
the
others
have
gone.
they
are
not
any
in
existence
as
such.
they
just
live
like
other
people.
they've
mixed
and
mingled
with
the
common
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many,
how
many
of
them
do
you
claim
have
an
interest
now?
it
may
be
that
someone
more
to
prove
there
that
they
are
members
of
the
tribe
because
of
some
have
imagined
the
money
advantage,
but
what
is
the
real
existence
of
the
so-called
“tribe”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i'm
aware
about
that
in
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
stated
that
in
your
brief,
contrary
to
what
the
court
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
gotten
any
thing
out
of
this
fishing
done
by
these
commercial
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
deny,
do
you
that
the
indians
if
they
wish
to,
small
groups
such
as
a
100
to
a
150
which
seems
to
be
the
most
they
have,
that
they
have
a
right
if
they
want
to
get
out
in
open
with
other
the
people
like
other
people
and
be
free
of
that
tribal
rule?
you
claim
they
don't
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
that
right
to
get
out
and
mix
with
the
other
people.
they
have
some
kind
of
property
right
in
this
land
on
which
they
don't
live
and
which
they
are
not
interested
to
get
some
money
for
somebody
exercise
some
fishing
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
used
to
be
a
tribe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
the
treaty?
what
language
of
the
treaty?
what
words
of
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
been
reading
it
and
i
can't
find
any
which
seems
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
my
brother
fortas
though
when
i
get
to
section
3,
it
says
“further
--
said
indians
in
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory”.
what
does
that
“in
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
indians
gave
the
settlers
the
right
to
fish
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
common?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
to
determine
how
the
fishing
should
be
done
by
everybody
in
the
state
or
territory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
exactly,
under
this
treaty,
what's
the
government's
position,
the
indians
have
the
right
to
do
here
now
and
what,
how
the
state
of
washington
regulated
them,
if
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
you
disagree
with
mr.
tanner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
mean
by
that
now
that
washington
has
no
power
to
regulate
their
power
to
fish
at
the
usual
and
accustomed
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
they
have
no
power
to
prevent
their
fishing
commercially
there
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
hey
do
have
power
to
permit
other
people
to
fish?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
can
washington
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wanted
it
in
the
context
of
this
situation
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
not
at
the
indian's
usual
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
what
do
they
say,
they
will
prevent
the
indians
from
doing
it?
is
it
merely
to
fish
with
the
nets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
washington
is
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
washington
is
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
fishing
with
a
net?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
us
to
tell
washington
that
it
can't?
if
it
will
go
ahead
and
do
something
outside
at
other
part,
it
can
prevent
that
fishing
with
the
net?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
usual
and
accustom
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
in
the
context
of
it.
they've
got
a
right
to
fish
with
the
net
at
this
place
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
until
washington
does
something
to
regulate
fishing
outside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
martin,
i
regret
to
ask
you
another
question
[inaudible]
i
have
been
waiting
to
ask
you
this?
it
seems
to
me
like
the
way
you
argue
this
and
i
can't
tell
exactly
how
you
argued,
i
have
to
admit
it,
i
can't
tell
exactly
what
the
state
of
that
–
the
department
of
justice
wants
us
to
do
except
that
you
say
that
the
indians
should
have
a
right
to
take
these
fish
and
to
somebody
it's
just
a
regulation
outside,
so
that
enough
fish
will
get
there
for
them
to
use
their
–
get
their
fish.
now
if
that's
the
case,
whose
duty
is
it
to
regulate
that,
is
it
the
government?
and
if
it's
the
government,
why
does
not
the
attorney
general
has
that
power
and
authority
to
file
a
suit
to
get
that
regulated
as
a
violation
of
the
treaty.
i
gather
from
what
you
are
saying
it's
a
violation
of
the
treaty
because
they
are
not
letting
enough
fish
come
down
for
the
indians
to
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
you
wanted
us
to
tell
washington
(voice
overlap)
that
they
can't
do
that
thing
until
somebody
regulates
that
on
the
outside
so
that
the
fish
get
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
saying
is
that
they
are
regulating
in
such
a
way
that
it
violates
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
that
it
violates
the
treaty,
whose
duty
is
it
to
try
to
get
that
straighten
out?
can
we
do
it
by
vague
interpretations
and
vague
statements
about
what's
reasonable
and
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
have
a
right
to
bring
one?
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
right
to
bring
one
on
the
part
of
the
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
couldn't
be
done?
why
should
it
be
thrown
into
our
lap
in
this
vague
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
didn't
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
by
failing
to
regulate
sufficiently
at
one
place,
they've
taken
it
out
of
their
power
to
regulate
the
indians
at
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
any
net
fishing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
in
the
issue
raised
in
this
case
that
we
have
to
pass
on
at
all
except
one,
whether
as
you
charge,
they
have
been
doing
net
fishing,
rather
as
you
charge
that
violates
a
valid
law
of
the
state
of
washington
and
whether
as
the
injunction
commanded
they
stop
doing
that
fishing,
what
else
do
we
have
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question
would
be,
as
i
see
it
in
from
your
pleading
in
the
injunction,
whether
your
law
against
net
fishing
is
a
bad
law
and
whether
that
from
that
standpoint
whether
you're
barred
from
enforcing
that
law
against
them
because
of
that
special
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
issue
entered
by
the
indians
based
on
the
thesis
of
the
government's
argument
that
the
court
should
canvass
and
consider
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
state
laws
were
bad
because
they
did
not
regulate
the
fishing
better
at
the
part
of
these
waters
that
he
says
they
should
have
regulated
back.
was
that
canvassed
or
considered
by
the
court?
do
we
have
any
basis
on
which
to
reach
a
conclusion
about
those
matters?
it
seems
to
me
like
they
somewhat
complicate
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
rather
you'd
leave
out
those
words.
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
there's
anything
in
this
record
that
would
authorize
us
to
reach
a
conclusion
if
we
desire
to
do
so;
that
the
state
laws
are
bad
because
they
in
some
way
discriminate
and
that
they
do
not
let
enough
fish
come
up
into
the
place
where
the
indians
fish.
is
there
any
mention
in
the
record
on
which
we
can
draw
legitimate
conclusions
on
that
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gathered
from
someone
yesterday
that
it
was
not
the
entire
tribe
can
be
doing
this
fishing,
certain
individuals,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
tribe
get
anything
out
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
a
personal
private
contract
made
by
several
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
more
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
how
did
the
entire
tribe
have
to
be
a
part
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
right
is
being
exercised
by
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
by
the
tribe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
conveyed
their
rights
to
these
indians,
these
two
or
three
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
did
the
others
fish?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
they
do
fish,
but
it's
not
commercial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
means
do
they
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
this
record
from
which
we
can
read
decisions
that
law
is
being
operated
in
such
a
way
that
[inaudible]
fishing
with
nets
that
large
commercial
companies
on
the
outside
who
are
able
to
fish
otherwise
than
which
is
being
given
an
unfair
advantage
over
the
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
three
indian
brothers
get
at
fish
while
the
others
are
fishing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
been
a
law
to
prevent
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
place
where
the
stream
that
if
they
catch
too
many
of
them
before
they
go
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
issue
of
that
kind
canvassed
to
any
extent
whatever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
these
indians
were
denied
their
right
to
fish
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
nets,
what
other
way
of
fishing
is
open
to
them
that
would
be
practical?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
take
their
nets
and
go
at
the
salt
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream?
how
could
they
fish
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
overturn
the
findings
and
conclusion
of
the
court
that
there
is
no
such
tribe
now
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
gone
--
nearly
all
of
them
gone
then
they
married?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
50
people?
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
asking
us
to
--
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
hundred
and
fifty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
live
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
live
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
more
than
a
dozen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
if
this
tribe
has
disappeared
as
a
tribe
that
they
still
have
this
fishing
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
if
this
tribe
has
disappeared
as
the
court
says
they
have,
they
still
have
any
fishing
right?
i
gather
from
the
findings
of
the
court,
while
you
can
identify
a
small
handful
of
people
live
one
place
or
another
as
being
a
bloodline
descent
from
these
indians,
they've
just
disappeared.
they've
mixed
with
the
white
people,
they've
gone
to
the
schools
and
integrated
with
them
and
they
do
not
maintain
any
kind
of
tribal
relationship.
do
you
claim
that
if
that
is
the
situation,
they
still
have
rights
under
this
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
form
of
government
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
court
says
they
have
no
form
of
government,
they
have
no
policemen,
they
have
no
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
they
are
a
part
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
a
state
--
is
a
situation.
congress,
of
course,
alone
has
the
right
to
settle
this
thing
politically.
what
you
seem
to
have
is
a
situation
where
the
indians
have
all
disappeared,
except
a
few
who
wants
some
fishing
rights;
that
the
others
have
gone.
they
are
not
any
in
existence
as
such.
they
just
live
like
other
people.
they've
mixed
and
mingled
with
the
common
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many,
how
many
of
them
do
you
claim
have
an
interest
now?
it
may
be
that
someone
more
to
prove
there
that
they
are
members
of
the
tribe
because
of
some
have
imagined
the
money
advantage,
but
what
is
the
real
existence
of
the
so-called
“tribe”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i'm
aware
about
that
in
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
stated
that
in
your
brief,
contrary
to
what
the
court
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
gotten
any
thing
out
of
this
fishing
done
by
these
commercial
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
deny,
do
you
that
the
indians
if
they
wish
to,
small
groups
such
as
a
100
to
a
150
which
seems
to
be
the
most
they
have,
that
they
have
a
right
if
they
want
to
get
out
in
open
with
other
the
people
like
other
people
and
be
free
of
that
tribal
rule?
you
claim
they
don't
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
that
right
to
get
out
and
mix
with
the
other
people.
they
have
some
kind
of
property
right
in
this
land
on
which
they
don't
live
and
which
they
are
not
interested
to
get
some
money
for
somebody
exercise
some
fishing
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
used
to
be
a
tribe?
