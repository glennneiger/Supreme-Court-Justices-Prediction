mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
opposing
counsel's
statement
regarding
the
initiation
or
the
complaint
rather
that
gave
rise
to
this
litigation.
at
the
time
that
this
complaint
was
drafted
and
filed
pursuant
to
the
uniform
declaratory
judgments
act,
injunctive
relief
was
sought
on
behalf,
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
fisheries,
the
department
of
game
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
theory
of
the
case
is
simply
that
we
are
asking
for
a
declaration
of
what
rights,
privileges
or
immunities,
if
any,
that
these
petitioners
possessed
by
virtue
of
the
“usual
and
accustomed
language
in
their
complaint”.
as
i'm
sure
the
court
has
aware
at
this
time,
salmon
fishing
is
one
of
the
most
important
natural
resources
that
we
have
and
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
in
the
pacific
northwest.
salmon
fishing
not
only
supports
one
of
our
major
industries,
commercial
fishing
but
also
attracts
unnumbered
thousands
of
sports
fishermen
who
angle
for
these
fish.
all
of
he
conservation
measures
which
are
enacted
into
law
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
or
by
virtue
of
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
state
administrative
procedures
act
are
directed
towards
the
goal
of
returning
a
sufficient
number
of
adult
salmon
to
the
spawning
beds.
state
regulation
of
non-indians
fishing
has
frankly
achieved
this
goal
by
virtue
of
these
comprehensive
regulations
which
are
placed
upon
the
time,
the
manner,
the
fishing
as
well
as
the
areas
in
which
either
commercial
or
sports
fishing
may
occur.
in
recent
years
and
by
recent
years,
i've
specified
the
year
1953,
various
indian
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington
in
addition
to
the
nisquallies
and
the
puyallups
have
begun
to
move
off
from
their
reservations
unto
the
various
rivers
and
streams
of
the
state
and
engage
in
commercial
net
fisheries.
the
usual
type
of
gear
which
has
been
employed
and
which
in
fact
was
employed,
as
the
record
shows
in
the
puyallup
case,
is
what
is
called
“monofilament
set
nets”.
now
monofilament
netting
is
outlawed
by
state
law
because
it's
invisible
type
of
plastic
material
which
is
invisible
to
the
fish.
the
fish
can't
see
it.
they
can't
thereby
avoid
becoming
entangled
in
the
mesh.
the
--
when
i
use
the
term
set
net,
a
set
net
is
simply
a
net
with
measures
i've
just
described,
which
is
attached
to
the
shore,
to
the
bank
and
then
allowed
with
the
lead
line
to
keep
the
net
mesh
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
or
float
line
on
the
top
and
it's
allowed
to
drift
or
it's
attached
to
the
bank
and
it
drifts
out
into
the
channel.
the
facts
in
the
record
of
this
case
shows,
and
i
did
have
these
exhibits
brought
out
for
the
court's
information.
this
map
of
which
is
plaintiff's
no.
14
gives
you
a
rough
idea
of
the
area
in
question.
the
area
of
fishing
activity
which
i've
just
described
on
the
puyallup
occurs
here
in
commencement
bay
and
basically
up
to
the
town
of
(inaudible).
the
drift
net,
they
would
drift
net
and
set
at
this
area
extensively
and
probably
the
largest
concentration,
the
greatest
number
and
the
longest
nets
involved
were
actually
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
out
in
the
commencement
bay.
the
evidence
in
the
record
establishes
that
at
all
times,
when
fish
were
running
or
ascending
this
stream
that
great
amounts
of
gear,
as
much
gear
as
it
was
physically
possible
to
put
in,
were
set,
were
put
in
and
this
gear
was
operated
on
a
24
hour
a
day,
7
days
a
week
basis.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
run
the
nets
usually
they
have
dingies
or
small
boats,
motorboats,
they
go
out
and
simply
pick
the
net
up
and
pull
the
fish
out
in
throw
it
and
replace
the
net
and
what
it's
called
running
the
net.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
fishery
in
reality
has
not
benefited
the
members
of
the
tribe
to
any
great
extent.
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows
that
three
brothers
primarily
benefited
of
the
puyallup
river
fishery,
the
three
(inaudible)
brothers.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
1963
they
did
a
gross
and
reported
sales
of
salmon
alone
within
the
state
of
washington
of
$128,000.
the
evidence
further
shows
that
none
of
this
money
was
returned
or
given
to
the
tribe;
there
was
no
tribal
taxation.
the
evidence
further
shows
in
this
record
that
there
was
no
law
enforcement.
there
was
conservation
or
regulation
of
any
sort
other
than
the
agreed
or
the
practical
limitation
if
you
will
of
the
person
who
is
engaging
in
this
particular
fishery.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
i
wanted
to
advert
to
this,
the
scope
of
the
problem.
the
scope
of
the
problem
is
statewide.
the
scope
of
the
problem
is
a
three
states
wide.
we
have
over
30
some
treaty
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington
and
they're
found
–
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
30,
i
don't
have
the
exact
figure.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
think
it's
38.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
treaty
indian
tribes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
treaty
tribes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
treaties
are
found
at
page
33
in
footnote
no.
5
in
the
state's
brief
or
respondent's
brief.
these
tribes,
at
the
time
the
treaties
were
negotiated
were
quite
scattered.
the
usual
and
accustomed
areas
of
these
tribes
encompass
almost
every
fish
producing
river
and
stream
in
puget
sound
and
out
of
the
straits
of
one
of
the
few
and
down
the
coast
and
also
in
the
columbia.
so
that
we
are
talking
here,
gentlemen,
about
an
extremely
significant
lawsuit
in
terms
of
the
resource
and
in
terms
of
the
amounts
of
money
that
are
involved
because
as,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
fish
have
become
quite
valuable.
there
is
a
good
market
for
fish
at
this
time.
it
is
this
type
of
unregulated
net
fishing
at
the
mouths
of
these,
of
the
rivers
of
washington
which
is
endangering
the
salmon
and
steelhead
resource.
the
position
of
the
state
of
washington
today
is
that
we
must
have
the
power
to
regulate
off
reservation
indian
net
fishing
if
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
accomplish
our
management
goals
of
conservation
of
the
salmon
resource.
in
this
connection,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
certain
other
exhibits
which
were
introduced
and
admitted
into
evidence
in
lower
court.
this
is
plaintiff's
as
exhibit
no.
“33”
and
portrays
on
a
bar
scale
the
catch
versus
the
escapement
of
silver
salmon,
which
is
one
of
the
species,
one
of
the
five
species
of
salmon
which
are
found
in
this
river
system.
as
can
be
seen,
the
blue
representing
the
amount
of
escapement
as
the
red
indicating
the
puyallup
fishery
commencing
in
1953.
you
see
the
red
lines
moving
up
to
these
points,
to
the
high
points
then
you
see
the
blue
lines
representing
the
escapement
going
down.
this
same
trend
has
been
observed
or
has
been
plotted
by
the
way
from
the
data
fish
tickets,
the
data
of
the
department
of
fisheries.
it
was
the
uniform
opinion
of
probably
the
–
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
the
red
bar,
your
honor,
represents
the
puyallup
indian
catch.
the
green
bar
represents
the
muckleshot
or
white
river
indian
catch.
the
muckleshoot
indian
reservation
is
on
a
tributary
to
the
puyallup.
if
i
would
refer
back
in
these
exhibits,
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
scale
but
here
is
the
muckleshoot
indian
reservation.
here
is
the
area
where
the
puyallups
were
fishing
and
one
of
the
impacts
or
one
of
the
aspect
--
the
impact
of
the
puyallup
fishery
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
to
have
a
serious
decline
in
the
legal
reservation
fishery
which
the
muckleshoot
indian
tribe.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
stir
me
up.
i
think
there
are
several
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
i
know
my
colleagues,
of
course,
are
going
to
be
touching
on
some
of
this.
the
use
of
the
phrase
in
this
clause
of
the
treaty,
“in
common
with
other
citizens”
appears
in
only
one
other
context
in
any
of
the
treaties
that
i've
read
at
--
they
were
executed
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
occurs
in
article
iii
of
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
where
this
phrase,
“in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
appears.
and
in
that
connection,
it
is
used
to
assure
the
rights
of
the
tribes
and
bands
signatory
to
that
treaty
to
travel
upon
that
public
highways
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
should
you
interpret
the
usual
and
accustomed
language
of
the
treaty
in
a
manner
to
grant
to
the
indians
or
to
secure
to
them
an
immunity
from
state
law
that
you
should
in
good
conscience
likewise
grant
them
the
same
right
with
regard
to
their
use
of
the
public
roadways
within
the
area
which
they
ceded
by
virtue
of
the
treaty.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
think
there
is
implicit
in
here
in
your
statement,
your
honor,
an
assumption
which
i
will
not
grant
you
for
purposes
of
this
argument
and
certainly,
i
do
not
so
grant
it
in
my
brief,
that
is
that
there
is
a
special
right
that
an
indian
has,
that
a
non-indian
does
not
have,
some
sort
of
a
qualified
privilege
or
an
immunity
from
another
wise
valid
state
conservation
law
or
regulation
outside
reservation
boundaries.
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
briefs
and
on
the
record
but
we
are
not
here
talking
about
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
assert
jurisdiction
within
the
boundaries
of
indian
reservation.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
alternatively
and
i
stress
the
alternatively,
we
take
the
position
that
the
court
below
did
adopt
the
proper
standard
or
guideline
by
which
the
indian
could
be
afforded
some
special
rights
subject
to
state
regulation,
subject
to
limitations
and
yet,
leave
the
state
with
the
power
necessary
to
accomplish
the
conservation
goals.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
your
question,
but
there
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no.
well,
at
the
present
time,
your
honor,
the
very
issue,
the
fundamental
issue
before
this
court
is
do
the
indians
have
a
special
right
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
there
is
no
discrimination
against
any
member
of
indian
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
--
with
regard
to
their
entry
into
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
limitation
or
no
limitation
or
bar
to
their
entry
into
what
i
term
“the
legal
fishery”.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
are
in
the
puget
sound.
there's
a
purse
seines
and
gill
net
commercial
fisheries,
there
is
an
offshore
trawl.
also,
i
suppose
we
should
include
the
charter
boats.
they
take
substantial
numbers
of
fish
and
then
of
course,
your
individual
sportsman.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
bulk
of
the
commercial
occurs
in
my
head
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
offshore
trawl
is,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
have
the
data,
it's
in
the
record,
i
just
don't
simply
recall
it
but
i
don't
know
the
respective
percentage
it
would
take,
is
it
from
puget
sound
district
to
offshore
trawl.
those
would
be
your
two
major
user
groups.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor,
the
very
substantial
numbers
taken
by
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
it's
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
take
them.
there
are
biological
reasons
which
were
testified
to
by
three
very
qualified
fishery
biology
experts,
the
dean,
doctor
richard
van
cleave,
the
dean
of
the
college
of
fisheries
in
the
university
of
washington,
professor
laureen
donaldson,
dr.
james
arthur,
roy
hamilton,
senior
biologist
from
portland,
they
testified
that
any
net
fishery,
regardless
of
who
is
operating
this
gear
is
not
biologically
sound.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
agree
with
your
statement
of
the
case,
your
honor.
the
defense
of
course
has
raised,
is
predicated
upon
what
the
government
contends
as
its
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
occurred
--
i
don't
mean
to
burden
you
with
a
stare
decisis
argument
but
we
are
relying
upon
prior
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
it.
it's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
so
it
took
three
weeks
to
try
the
case
but
that's
the
issue.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
puget
sound.
now,
at
the
commencement
bay
area,
and
i
refer
back
to
this
map
again,
this
area
here,
which
isn't
really
sharks
go
out
here,
is
closed
to
commercial
fishing.
it's
closed
to
commercial
fishing.
your
commercial
fishery
commences
further
out
in
the
sound.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
out
in
the
salt
water.
the
reason
for
the
closure
is
that
the
mouth
of
these
rivers
is
that
the
fish
tend
to
mill.
they
will
hold
and
await
for
fresh
it
to
begin
their
with
upward
migration
up
to
the
spawning
ground.
so
that
if
you
permit
a
net
fishery
as
this
point
in
their
migration,
your
fishing
the
same
stocks
over
and
over
again.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
the
fish
to
ten
to
hold
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
fish
will
hold
sometime
as
long
as
three
and
four
weeks
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
also
the
fish
will
hold
in
their
migration
up
to
the
spawning
area.
they'll
get
to
a
pocket
or
a
hole
in
the
river
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
and
they
are
not
ripe
yet,
they
are
not
ready
to
perform
the
spawning
act
and
therefore,
they
will
simply
hold
until
their
basic
bodily
mechanisms
get
ready
for
the
ultimate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
where
we
left
off
yesterday,
i
think
i
was
discussing
the
impact
of
the
off
reservation
indian
fisheries
as
they
have
developed
in
recent
years
upon
the
salmon
and
the
steelhead
resources
of
the
state.
and
in
this
connection,
as
you
may
recall,
i
was
referring
to
certain
graphs,
which
had
been
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
trial
court
which
i
think
demonstrate
in
graphical
form
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
salmon
resource.
the
graph
which
you
presently
see
on
the
chart
reflects
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
the
indians
have
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
and
by
virtue
of
the
language
contained
in
the
treaty.
now
we
are
relying
upon
the
phrase,
“in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
and
as
i
mentioned
to
your
honor,
yesterday,
this
phrase
“in
common
with
the
citizen
of
the
territory”
also
appears
in
another
context
in
the
yakima
treaty;
that
has
to
do
with
the
right
of
the
indians
to
go
upon
the
public
road
ways.
these
are
interpretations.
it's
further
supported,
your
honor,
by
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
itself,
by
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
of
medicine

and
the
minutes
of
the
treaty

may
i
have
one
moment
–
of
the

“the

has
many
white

some
to

wishes

to
learn
to

and
your
children
to
go
to

good

and
he
now
wants
me
to
make

bargain
with
you,
etcetera”.
these
are
the
only
two
references
that
do
exist
in
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
convention
of
medicine
creek.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
i've
read
you
the
only
two
relevant
portions
that
exist
in
this
document.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
will
concede
a
very
limited
bartering
although
i
will
not
--
at
that
time,
the
fish
were
extremely
plentiful
and
it
was
certainly
and
it
did
not
require
any
great
deal
of
effort
to
obtain
fish
at
that
time,
in
aboriginal
times
or
pre-treaty
times
by
either
indian
or
non-indian
by
simply
putting
in
a
very
simple
brush
wear
in
shallow
waters,
which
was
the
testimony
at
the
trial
court
by
the
anthropologist.
the
indians
were
able
to
catch
fish.
his
testimony
further
was
that
the
indians
did
not
fish
in
deep
water.
they
used
spears,
deep
nets
and
brush
wears
in
shallow
water
because
they
simply
didn't
have
the
technological
ability
at
that
time,
with
the
materials
that
they
had
at
that
time,
to
construct
an
obstruction
if
you
will
to
the
deep
water
or
the
high
velocity
water
streams;
in
other
words,
the
main
channels
of
the
streams.
their
fishing
activity
occurred
primarily
in
a
more
shallow
tributaries
in
the
various
rivers
that
lead
in
or
feed
in
into
the
puget
sound
area.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
concede
unlimited
barter.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
unlimited
barter
and
i
believe
the
evidence
in
the
records
will
substantiate
that
position
but
insofar
as
a
large
scale
commercial
enterprise,
as
we
know
it
today,
certainly,
i
will
not
concede
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
remembering,
your
honor,
that
at
that
time,
the
indians
at
puget
sound
(inaudible)
1855
were
not
citizens
and
could
at
that
time
be
legally
discriminated
against.
and
i
think
that
if
the
treaty
is
read
or
interpreted
in
light
of
its
historical
context
or
setting,
i
think
that
this
gives
credence
to
(voice
overlap)
the
interpretation
that
i'm
reaching.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
that
is
my
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
in
fact,
this
is
simply
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
being
administered
equally
to
indians
or
applied
to
indians
as
well
as
non-indians.
in
other
words,
the
law
is
a,
assuming
it
meets
other
constitutional
test
of
reasonableness
and
legislative
object
and
so
forth,
it
is
applied
uniformly
to
persons
regardless
of
race,
creed
or
color.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
the
distinction
that
has
been
legislatively
drawn
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
is
that
“thou
shall
not
place
nets;
thou
shall
not
operate
with
operate
gear
or
nets
of
the
type
and
nature
which
had
already
been
described
in
fresh
water
streams
of
the
state”
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
the
reason
for
outlawing
netting
and
fish
wheels,
fish
traps,
all
are
prohibited.
dynamiting
is
prohibited.
poisoning
of
the
river
is
prohibited
by
the
legislature
to
protect
these
fish
in
their
nurseries.
this
fish
must
be
able
--
must
be
protected
from
a
net
fishery
because
it
constitute
such
a
hazard
to
the
maintenance
of
the
run.
as
i've
mentioned,
your
honor,
the
economic
value
of
the
fish
is
such
that
if
we
further
would
restrict
the
puget
sound
fishery
for
sport
and
commercial
and
we
got
more
fish
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
we
would
merely
see
a
greater
indian
take.
and,
i
think
this
is
demonstrated
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
my
position
is,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
feasible
because,
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
i
believe
in
response
to
your
honor's
question,
the
fish
at
the
time
that
they
make
the
transition
from
salt
to
fresh
water,
tend
to
mill
and
halt.
they
actually
go
through
a
physiological
change.
the
salmon
do
in
their
upstream
ascent
to
the
spawning
grounds
and
they
will
sometimes
hold
and
the
evidence
on
this
record
and
the
opinions
of
the
experts
that
testified
in
the
trial
below,
clearly
indicate
that
this
fish
tend
to
mill
and
they
will
hold
for
three
or
four
weeks.
they
further,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
your
statement.
i
do
believe
there
are
sound
biological
or
management
reasons
for
this
state
law.
but
further,
your
honor,
i
point
out
to
you,
is
it
alright
to
–
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
-
but
would
it
be
permissible
to
rob
a
store
if
you
only
took
$50
as
opposed
to
$500.
the
question
that
i
see
it
from
my
client's
point
of
view
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
if
the
court
finds
that
he
has
this
right
then
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
regulate.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
because
the
state
would
be
then
in
the
position
(
voice
overlap)
of
defining
the
treaty
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
as
an
alternative,
i
would
offer
to
the
court
the
rationale
utilized
by
the
court
below,
but
that
is
not
my
primary
contention.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
are
you
assuming
--
oh!
may
i?
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
a
question
and
respond
to
a
question.
i
would
point
out
to
you
the
problem
of
milling
and
holding.
i
would
further
point
out
that
if
the
question
of
how
many
fish
is
left
to
the
indians,
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
sufficient
numbers
would
escape
up
the
stream
to
the
spawning
grounds,
to
perpetuate
the
run
in
anyway,
anywhere
near
the
--
a
production
level
as
opposed
to
merely
maintaining
these
species
of
fish
in
existence
and
by
that
i
mean
one
or
two
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
are
you
assuming
state
regulation,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
and
force
the
problem.
in
this
connection,
we
do
have
a
serious
problem
in
the
state
of
washington
with
regards
to
the
identification
of
members
of
these
various
38
tribes.
to
my
knowledge,
tribal
rolls
had
been
prepared
for
only
the
three
or
four
largest
tribes
and
the
smaller
tribes,
the
fragmented
groups
throughout
puget
sound,
do
not
have
membership
rolls.
this
has
created
serious
problems
in
terms
of
law
enforcement
on
the
part
of
the
game
protector.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
time
when
anyone
wants
to
fish
is
when
the
fish
is
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
in
the
opinion,
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
opinion
of
dr.
van
cleave,
the
dean
of
the
college
of
fisheries,
whose
opinion
was
corroborated
by
dr.
hamilton
and
professor
donaldson,
three
eminently
qualified
biologists
who
have
spent
their
life
in
science
studying
the
problems
of
salmon.
in
their
opinion,
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
they
give
several
reasons
for
it.
i've
already
mentioned
two.
there
are
others.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
net
fishery
which
actually
sweeps
the
spawning
area
itself,
which
of
course
are
in
these
fresh
water
streams,
even
the
fish
that
aren't
taken
tend
to
be
disturbed,
and
tend
to
spawn
unsuccessfully.
and
there's
data
in
the
record
which
studies
and
observations
which
have
been
made
by
trained
people
to
indicate
that
this
is
a
side
effect.
in
other
words,
the
fish
are
harassed
at
or
about
the
time
that
they
are
to
engage
in
the
spawning
act.
they
will
tend
to
spawn
unsuccessfully.
in
other
words,
they
will
spawn
prematurely
in
deep
water
rather
than
going
and
making
the
nest
or
the
red
in
the
gravel
in
depositing
the
eggs
and
continuing
on
in
that
manner.
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
when
is
the
steelhead
season?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
this
particular
river
system,
the
steelhead
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
they
run
december
to
march.
they
are
present
in
the
river.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
the
puyallup
system,
they
run
through
from
approximately
july
to
march,
your
honor.
at
the
various
species
are
--
as
adults
here
in
the
river,
not
all
times
in
the
river
you
will
have
the
juveniles
so
that
during
their
fresh
water
rearing
period
but
we
really
not
--
these
nets
do
not
affect
the
downstream
or
out
stream
migration
of
the
juveniles,
except
insofar
as
the
spawning
nests
are
disturbed
by
people
or
nets
being
dragged
across
them.
they
will
tend
to
break
up
the
nest
and
expose
the
eggs
and
they
will
then
--
you
will
have
extremely
high
mortalities
at
this
particular
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
--
in
this
river
system,
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
run
at
very
various
periods,
is
my
recollection.
i
just
simply
--
as
i
recall
it,
the
definition
of
a
jack
salmon
is
that
it's
simply
an
immature
salmon
or
salmon
that
came
back
a
year
too
soon
after
spending
his
salt
water
type
as
a
mature.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i'm
aware
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
regulated
with
regard
to
time,
area
and
gear.
and
i
think
in
this
connection,
it
could
be
pointed,
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
as
an
example
that
in
the
year
1942
on
the
columbia
river,
they
were
allowed
274
days
open
for
gill
netting
in
the
downstream
or
lower
portions
of
the
columbia
below
booneville
dam.
in
1967
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
all
they
could
within
the
area
that
is
open.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
fresh
water,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
is
the
only
fresh
water
fishery
for
salmon,
commercial
fishery
for
salmon
in
the
pacific
northwest.
the
reason
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
is
a
10%
to
the
columbia
river
compact,
your
honor,
which
is
essentially
joint
management
of
the
fishery
by
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon.
this
was
ratified
by
congress
so
that
you
have
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
established
pursuant
to
the
compact
so
that
this
particular
(voice
overlap)
will
not
apply.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
making
by
my
illustration
was
that
there
is
--
there
have
been
in
the
last
30
years
greater
and
greater
restrictions
placed
upon
both
commercial
and
sport
fisheries,
particularly
commercial.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
indians
are
being
regulated,
your
honor,
on
the
same
basis
as
all
other
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
but,
your
honor,
assuming,
of
course,
that
there
is
a
special
right
that
the
indians
possessed
by
virtue
of
this
treaty
language
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
record
does
not
establish
any
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
washington
with
regard
to
entry
or
use
of
gear
on
the
part
--
because
of
bloodline
ancestry.
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
is
correct.
it
is
last
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
there
are
two
points
that
do
occur
to
me
as
a
result
of
your
statement.
the
first
is,
that
there
in
fact
are
numerous
indians
who
engage
in
the
salt
water
fishery
and
in
fact
quite
recently,
the
bureau
of
indians
affairs
has
obtained
apparently
the
necessary
appropriations
and
has
purchased
purse
seine
vessels
for
the
makah
tribes
and
the
makah
tribe
is
now
going
to
be
as
a
tribal
operation,
fishing
commercial
in
the
straits
juan
de
fuca.
there
are,
as
i
mentioned,
there
are
numerous
indians
who
do
engage
in
the
salt
water
fishery
and
there
was
certainly
have
no
provisional
limitation
upon
their
ability
to
do
so
if
they
so
desired.
i
think
another
point
that
should
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
has
to
do
with
the
value
of
the
fish
at
the
time
or
at
the
point
of
its
migration
where
it's
caught.
now
if
you
take
a
fish
that's
up
near
the
spawning
grounds,
you've
got
a
fish
that
is
changed
substantially
in
quality,
deteriorated
in
quality
from
that
same
bright
fish,
which
would
be
taken
in
the
salt
water.
it
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
its
bodily
energies
in
making
its
ascent
or
upstream
migration.
its
flesh,
it's
body
oils
have
been
expanded.
it's
flesh,
rather
than
being
firmed
is
soft
and
shrunky.
it
is
a
very
low
commercial
value
fish.
the
evidence,
i
believe,
is
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
some
of
this
lower
value
fish
would
go
down
as
low
as
three
to
five
cents
of
pound
for
the
first
price
to
the
fishermen
as
opposed
to
salt
water
in
the
same
value
of
thirty-five
to
forty
cents
of
pound.
these
are
very
rough
figures.
i'm
giving
you
the
exact
market
quotations
but
there
is,
there
isn't
can
be
and
it
is
a
substantial
difference
in
the
actual
economic
value
of
that
fish,
depending
upon
the
point
which
it's
taken.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
your
honor,
i
think
this
goes
back
about
ten
minutes
and
i
know
i'm
going
overtime
in
terms
of
my
colleagues,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
--
that
was
only
the
first
part
of
my
illustration.
in
1942,
the
states,
under
the
columbia
river
compact,
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
allowed
274
days
for
gill
nets
in
the
lower
columbia.
in
1967,
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon
allowed
80
days,
the
same
trend
is
apparent
on
the
puget
sound
fishery,
both
as
it
would
apply
to
purse
seine
or
drift
gill
net
type
of
fisheries.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
at
that
time,
your
honor,
the
management
agencies,
the
persons
who
are
trained
in
this
field
or
in
this
science
if
you
will,
made
the
decision
that
they
had
a
certain
escapement
goal
to
make.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
an
escapement
goal
to
make
of
so
many
fish
over
booneville
dam
of
the
various
species.
at
that
time,
the
runs
were
in
a
lot
better
shape
than
they
are
now.
so,
therefore,
they
were
able
to
meet
their
escapement
goal
and
yet
allow
this
much
fishery.
in
order
to
meet
the
same
escapement
goal
for
that
same
number
of
fish
over
booneville
dam
on
the
columbia,
they
had
to
reduce
the
fishery
on
the
various
species
in
the
columbia
on
salmon
now
from
274
days
in
1942
to
80
days
in
1967
and
those
figures
are
not
--
they
are
fairly
reflective
figures
in
terms
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
i
keep
repeating
myself
but
the
problem
is
that
if
you
allow
a
fishery
there,
it
will
say
hypothesize
one
day
a
week
and
the
fish
that
it's
fishing,
the
stock
that
it's
fishing
is
a
stock
that's
milling
as
opposed
to
migrating,
which
is
one
reason
by
the
way,
your
honors,
that
there
is
a
fishery
allowed
in
the
lower
columbia
for
commercial
purposes
is
because
it
is
migration
water
as
opposed
to
holding
water.
this
fish
do
not
stop
in
their
migrations.
they
don't
begin
to
stop
until
they
are
up
either
in
the
mouth
of
these
rivers
they've
already
made
their
salt
to
fresh
transition
in
their
life
cycle
and
they
don't
begin
to
hold
up
until
they
begin
to
get
up
into
the
tributaries
either
above
booneville
or
up
the
water
limit
or
one
of
the
other
tributaries
in
the
lower
columbia.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
not
in
the
columbia
nor
anywhere
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
by
area,
by
area
prohibition
and
this
is
what
this
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
there
is
no
commercial
fishing
permitted
in
fresh
water
in
the
state
of
washington,
with
the
exception
of
the
lower
columbia,
which
is,
as
i
mentioned,
under
this
columbia
river
compact
jointly
managed
by
the
two
states.
i'm
way
overtime
and
i
don't
want
to
deprive
my
colleagues
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
a
complicated
thing,
your
honor.
it's
something
that
we
have
–
within
the
state
of
washington
and
i'm
sure
in
oregon
and
idaho
also,
we've
delegated
this
management,
responsibilities
to
persons
who
are
trained
in
this
area
or
in
this
field
to
act.
if
they
act
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
or
don't
do
their
jobs
–-
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
my
answer
would
be
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
opposing
counsel's
statement
regarding
the
initiation
or
the
complaint
rather
that
gave
rise
to
this
litigation.
at
the
time
that
this
complaint
was
drafted
and
filed
pursuant
to
the
uniform
declaratory
judgments
act,
injunctive
relief
was
sought
on
behalf,
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
fisheries,
the
department
of
game
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
theory
of
the
case
is
simply
that
we
are
asking
for
a
declaration
of
what
rights,
privileges
or
immunities,
if
any,
that
these
petitioners
possessed
by
virtue
of
the
“usual
and
accustomed
language
in
their
complaint”.
as
i'm
sure
the
court
has
aware
at
this
time,
salmon
fishing
is
one
of
the
most
important
natural
resources
that
we
have
and
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
in
the
pacific
northwest.
salmon
fishing
not
only
supports
one
of
our
major
industries,
commercial
fishing
but
also
attracts
unnumbered
thousands
of
sports
fishermen
who
angle
for
these
fish.
all
of
he
conservation
measures
which
are
enacted
into
law
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
or
by
virtue
of
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
state
administrative
procedures
act
are
directed
towards
the
goal
of
returning
a
sufficient
number
of
adult
salmon
to
the
spawning
beds.
state
regulation
of
non-indians
fishing
has
frankly
achieved
this
goal
by
virtue
of
these
comprehensive
regulations
which
are
placed
upon
the
time,
the
manner,
the
fishing
as
well
as
the
areas
in
which
either
commercial
or
sports
fishing
may
occur.
in
recent
years
and
by
recent
years,
i've
specified
the
year
1953,
various
indian
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington
in
addition
to
the
nisquallies
and
the
puyallups
have
begun
to
move
off
from
their
reservations
unto
the
various
rivers
and
streams
of
the
state
and
engage
in
commercial
net
fisheries.
the
usual
type
of
gear
which
has
been
employed
and
which
in
fact
was
employed,
as
the
record
shows
in
the
puyallup
case,
is
what
is
called
“monofilament
set
nets”.
now
monofilament
netting
is
outlawed
by
state
law
because
it's
invisible
type
of
plastic
material
which
is
invisible
to
the
fish.
the
fish
can't
see
it.
they
can't
thereby
avoid
becoming
entangled
in
the
mesh.
the
--
when
i
use
the
term
set
net,
a
set
net
is
simply
a
net
with
measures
i've
just
described,
which
is
attached
to
the
shore,
to
the
bank
and
then
allowed
with
the
lead
line
to
keep
the
net
mesh
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
or
float
line
on
the
top
and
it's
allowed
to
drift
or
it's
attached
to
the
bank
and
it
drifts
out
into
the
channel.
the
facts
in
the
record
of
this
case
shows,
and
i
did
have
these
exhibits
brought
out
for
the
court's
information.
this
map
of
which
is
plaintiff's
no.
14
gives
you
a
rough
idea
of
the
area
in
question.
the
area
of
fishing
activity
which
i've
just
described
on
the
puyallup
occurs
here
in
commencement
bay
and
basically
up
to
the
town
of
(inaudible).
the
drift
net,
they
would
drift
net
and
set
at
this
area
extensively
and
probably
the
largest
concentration,
the
greatest
number
and
the
longest
nets
involved
were
actually
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
out
in
the
commencement
bay.
the
evidence
in
the
record
establishes
that
at
all
times,
when
fish
were
running
or
ascending
this
stream
that
great
amounts
of
gear,
as
much
gear
as
it
was
physically
possible
to
put
in,
were
set,
were
put
in
and
this
gear
was
operated
on
a
24
hour
a
day,
7
days
a
week
basis.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
run
the
nets
usually
they
have
dingies
or
small
boats,
motorboats,
they
go
out
and
simply
pick
the
net
up
and
pull
the
fish
out
in
throw
it
and
replace
the
net
and
what
it's
called
running
the
net.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
fishery
in
reality
has
not
benefited
the
members
of
the
tribe
to
any
great
extent.
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows
that
three
brothers
primarily
benefited
of
the
puyallup
river
fishery,
the
three
(inaudible)
brothers.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
1963
they
did
a
gross
and
reported
sales
of
salmon
alone
within
the
state
of
washington
of
$128,000.
the
evidence
further
shows
that
none
of
this
money
was
returned
or
given
to
the
tribe;
there
was
no
tribal
taxation.
the
evidence
further
shows
in
this
record
that
there
was
no
law
enforcement.
there
was
conservation
or
regulation
of
any
sort
other
than
the
agreed
or
the
practical
limitation
if
you
will
of
the
person
who
is
engaging
in
this
particular
fishery.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
i
wanted
to
advert
to
this,
the
scope
of
the
problem.
the
scope
of
the
problem
is
statewide.
the
scope
of
the
problem
is
a
three
states
wide.
we
have
over
30
some
treaty
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington
and
they're
found
–
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
30,
i
don't
have
the
exact
figure.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
think
it's
38.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
treaty
indian
tribes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
treaty
tribes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
treaties
are
found
at
page
33
in
footnote
no.
5
in
the
state's
brief
or
respondent's
brief.
these
tribes,
at
the
time
the
treaties
were
negotiated
were
quite
scattered.
the
usual
and
accustomed
areas
of
these
tribes
encompass
almost
every
fish
producing
river
and
stream
in
puget
sound
and
out
of
the
straits
of
one
of
the
few
and
down
the
coast
and
also
in
the
columbia.
so
that
we
are
talking
here,
gentlemen,
about
an
extremely
significant
lawsuit
in
terms
of
the
resource
and
in
terms
of
the
amounts
of
money
that
are
involved
because
as,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
fish
have
become
quite
valuable.
there
is
a
good
market
for
fish
at
this
time.
it
is
this
type
of
unregulated
net
fishing
at
the
mouths
of
these,
of
the
rivers
of
washington
which
is
endangering
the
salmon
and
steelhead
resource.
the
position
of
the
state
of
washington
today
is
that
we
must
have
the
power
to
regulate
off
reservation
indian
net
fishing
if
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
accomplish
our
management
goals
of
conservation
of
the
salmon
resource.
in
this
connection,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
certain
other
exhibits
which
were
introduced
and
admitted
into
evidence
in
lower
court.
this
is
plaintiff's
as
exhibit
no.
“33”
and
portrays
on
a
bar
scale
the
catch
versus
the
escapement
of
silver
salmon,
which
is
one
of
the
species,
one
of
the
five
species
of
salmon
which
are
found
in
this
river
system.
as
can
be
seen,
the
blue
representing
the
amount
of
escapement
as
the
red
indicating
the
puyallup
fishery
commencing
in
1953.
you
see
the
red
lines
moving
up
to
these
points,
to
the
high
points
then
you
see
the
blue
lines
representing
the
escapement
going
down.
this
same
trend
has
been
observed
or
has
been
plotted
by
the
way
from
the
data
fish
tickets,
the
data
of
the
department
of
fisheries.
it
was
the
uniform
opinion
of
probably
the
–
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
the
red
bar,
your
honor,
represents
the
puyallup
indian
catch.
the
green
bar
represents
the
muckleshot
or
white
river
indian
catch.
the
muckleshoot
indian
reservation
is
on
a
tributary
to
the
puyallup.
if
i
would
refer
back
in
these
exhibits,
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
scale
but
here
is
the
muckleshoot
indian
reservation.
here
is
the
area
where
the
puyallups
were
fishing
and
one
of
the
impacts
or
one
of
the
aspect
--
the
impact
of
the
puyallup
fishery
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
to
have
a
serious
decline
in
the
legal
reservation
fishery
which
the
muckleshoot
indian
tribe.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
stir
me
up.
i
think
there
are
several
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
i
know
my
colleagues,
of
course,
are
going
to
be
touching
on
some
of
this.
the
use
of
the
phrase
in
this
clause
of
the
treaty,
“in
common
with
other
citizens”
appears
in
only
one
other
context
in
any
of
the
treaties
that
i've
read
at
--
they
were
executed
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
occurs
in
article
iii
of
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
where
this
phrase,
“in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
appears.
and
in
that
connection,
it
is
used
to
assure
the
rights
of
the
tribes
and
bands
signatory
to
that
treaty
to
travel
upon
that
public
highways
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
should
you
interpret
the
usual
and
accustomed
language
of
the
treaty
in
a
manner
to
grant
to
the
indians
or
to
secure
to
them
an
immunity
from
state
law
that
you
should
in
good
conscience
likewise
grant
them
the
same
right
with
regard
to
their
use
of
the
public
roadways
within
the
area
which
they
ceded
by
virtue
of
the
treaty.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
think
there
is
implicit
in
here
in
your
statement,
your
honor,
an
assumption
which
i
will
not
grant
you
for
purposes
of
this
argument
and
certainly,
i
do
not
so
grant
it
in
my
brief,
that
is
that
there
is
a
special
right
that
an
indian
has,
that
a
non-indian
does
not
have,
some
sort
of
a
qualified
privilege
or
an
immunity
from
another
wise
valid
state
conservation
law
or
regulation
outside
reservation
boundaries.
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
briefs
and
on
the
record
but
we
are
not
here
talking
about
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
assert
jurisdiction
within
the
boundaries
of
indian
reservation.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
alternatively
and
i
stress
the
alternatively,
we
take
the
position
that
the
court
below
did
adopt
the
proper
standard
or
guideline
by
which
the
indian
could
be
afforded
some
special
rights
subject
to
state
regulation,
subject
to
limitations
and
yet,
leave
the
state
with
the
power
necessary
to
accomplish
the
conservation
goals.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
your
question,
but
there
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no.
well,
at
the
present
time,
your
honor,
the
very
issue,
the
fundamental
issue
before
this
court
is
do
the
indians
have
a
special
right
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
there
is
no
discrimination
against
any
member
of
indian
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
--
with
regard
to
their
entry
into
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
limitation
or
no
limitation
or
bar
to
their
entry
into
what
i
term
“the
legal
fishery”.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
are
in
the
puget
sound.
there's
a
purse
seines
and
gill
net
commercial
fisheries,
there
is
an
offshore
trawl.
also,
i
suppose
we
should
include
the
charter
boats.
they
take
substantial
numbers
of
fish
and
then
of
course,
your
individual
sportsman.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
bulk
of
the
commercial
occurs
in
my
head
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
offshore
trawl
is,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
have
the
data,
it's
in
the
record,
i
just
don't
simply
recall
it
but
i
don't
know
the
respective
percentage
it
would
take,
is
it
from
puget
sound
district
to
offshore
trawl.
those
would
be
your
two
major
user
groups.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor,
the
very
substantial
numbers
taken
by
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
it's
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
take
them.
there
are
biological
reasons
which
were
testified
to
by
three
very
qualified
fishery
biology
experts,
the
dean,
doctor
richard
van
cleave,
the
dean
of
the
college
of
fisheries
in
the
university
of
washington,
professor
laureen
donaldson,
dr.
james
arthur,
roy
hamilton,
senior
biologist
from
portland,
they
testified
that
any
net
fishery,
regardless
of
who
is
operating
this
gear
is
not
biologically
sound.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
agree
with
your
statement
of
the
case,
your
honor.
the
defense
of
course
has
raised,
is
predicated
upon
what
the
government
contends
as
its
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
occurred
--
i
don't
mean
to
burden
you
with
a
stare
decisis
argument
but
we
are
relying
upon
prior
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
it.
it's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
so
it
took
three
weeks
to
try
the
case
but
that's
the
issue.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
puget
sound.
now,
at
the
commencement
bay
area,
and
i
refer
back
to
this
map
again,
this
area
here,
which
isn't
really
sharks
go
out
here,
is
closed
to
commercial
fishing.
it's
closed
to
commercial
fishing.
your
commercial
fishery
commences
further
out
in
the
sound.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
out
in
the
salt
water.
the
reason
for
the
closure
is
that
the
mouth
of
these
rivers
is
that
the
fish
tend
to
mill.
they
will
hold
and
await
for
fresh
it
to
begin
their
with
upward
migration
up
to
the
spawning
ground.
so
that
if
you
permit
a
net
fishery
as
this
point
in
their
migration,
your
fishing
the
same
stocks
over
and
over
again.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
the
fish
to
ten
to
hold
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
fish
will
hold
sometime
as
long
as
three
and
four
weeks
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
also
the
fish
will
hold
in
their
migration
up
to
the
spawning
area.
they'll
get
to
a
pocket
or
a
hole
in
the
river
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
and
they
are
not
ripe
yet,
they
are
not
ready
to
perform
the
spawning
act
and
therefore,
they
will
simply
hold
until
their
basic
bodily
mechanisms
get
ready
for
the
ultimate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
where
we
left
off
yesterday,
i
think
i
was
discussing
the
impact
of
the
off
reservation
indian
fisheries
as
they
have
developed
in
recent
years
upon
the
salmon
and
the
steelhead
resources
of
the
state.
and
in
this
connection,
as
you
may
recall,
i
was
referring
to
certain
graphs,
which
had
been
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
trial
court
which
i
think
demonstrate
in
graphical
form
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
salmon
resource.
the
graph
which
you
presently
see
on
the
chart
reflects
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
the
indians
have
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
and
by
virtue
of
the
language
contained
in
the
treaty.
now
we
are
relying
upon
the
phrase,
“in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory”
and
as
i
mentioned
to
your
honor,
yesterday,
this
phrase
“in
common
with
the
citizen
of
the
territory”
also
appears
in
another
context
in
the
yakima
treaty;
that
has
to
do
with
the
right
of
the
indians
to
go
upon
the
public
road
ways.
these
are
interpretations.
it's
further
supported,
your
honor,
by
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
itself,
by
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek
and
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
at
camp
walla-walla,
which
led
to
the
treaty
negotiated
with
the
confederated
tribes
and
bands
that
presently
are
on
the
yakima
reservation.
this
document
was
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
trial
court,
plaintiff's
exhibit
“45”.
it
is
a
copy
of
the
national
archives
minutes.
referring
to
page
7.
“it
was
also
thought
necessary
to
allow
them
to
fish
at
all
accustomed
places
since
this
could
not
interfere
in
any
manner
with
the
rights
of
citizens
and
was
necessary
for
the
indians
to
obtain
subsistence”.
this
document
i
am
referring,
the
certified
copy
of
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
of
medicine
creek,
which
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
it
is
not
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
document
is
part
of
the
record
which
was
sent
up
and
it
is
here.
this
is
the
document
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
is
at
page
7,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
referring
also
to
page
5
–
may
i
have
one
moment
–
of
the
same
document,
“the
great
father
has
many
white
children
who
come
here,
some
to
build
mills,
some
to
make
farms
and
some
to
fish
and
the
great
father
wishes
you
to
have
homes,
asked
you
for
your
horses
and
fishing
places.
he
wishes
you
to
learn
to
farm
and
your
children
to
go
to
a
good
school
and
he
now
wants
me
to
make
a
bargain
with
you,
etcetera”.
these
are
the
only
two
references
that
do
exist
in
the
minutes
of
the
treaty
convention
of
medicine
creek.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
i've
read
you
the
only
two
relevant
portions
that
exist
in
this
document.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
will
concede
a
very
limited
bartering
although
i
will
not
--
at
that
time,
the
fish
were
extremely
plentiful
and
it
was
certainly
and
it
did
not
require
any
great
deal
of
effort
to
obtain
fish
at
that
time,
in
aboriginal
times
or
pre-treaty
times
by
either
indian
or
non-indian
by
simply
putting
in
a
very
simple
brush
wear
in
shallow
waters,
which
was
the
testimony
at
the
trial
court
by
the
anthropologist.
the
indians
were
able
to
catch
fish.
his
testimony
further
was
that
the
indians
did
not
fish
in
deep
water.
they
used
spears,
deep
nets
and
brush
wears
in
shallow
water
because
they
simply
didn't
have
the
technological
ability
at
that
time,
with
the
materials
that
they
had
at
that
time,
to
construct
an
obstruction
if
you
will
to
the
deep
water
or
the
high
velocity
water
streams;
in
other
words,
the
main
channels
of
the
streams.
their
fishing
activity
occurred
primarily
in
a
more
shallow
tributaries
in
the
various
rivers
that
lead
in
or
feed
in
into
the
puget
sound
area.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
concede
unlimited
barter.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
unlimited
barter
and
i
believe
the
evidence
in
the
records
will
substantiate
that
position
but
insofar
as
a
large
scale
commercial
enterprise,
as
we
know
it
today,
certainly,
i
will
not
concede
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
remembering,
your
honor,
that
at
that
time,
the
indians
at
puget
sound
(inaudible)
1855
were
not
citizens
and
could
at
that
time
be
legally
discriminated
against.
and
i
think
that
if
the
treaty
is
read
or
interpreted
in
light
of
its
historical
context
or
setting,
i
think
that
this
gives
credence
to
(voice
overlap)
the
interpretation
that
i'm
reaching.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
that
is
my
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
in
fact,
this
is
simply
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
being
administered
equally
to
indians
or
applied
to
indians
as
well
as
non-indians.
in
other
words,
the
law
is
a,
assuming
it
meets
other
constitutional
test
of
reasonableness
and
legislative
object
and
so
forth,
it
is
applied
uniformly
to
persons
regardless
of
race,
creed
or
color.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
the
distinction
that
has
been
legislatively
drawn
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
is
that
“thou
shall
not
place
nets;
thou
shall
not
operate
with
operate
gear
or
nets
of
the
type
and
nature
which
had
already
been
described
in
fresh
water
streams
of
the
state”
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
the
reason
for
outlawing
netting
and
fish
wheels,
fish
traps,
all
are
prohibited.
dynamiting
is
prohibited.
poisoning
of
the
river
is
prohibited
by
the
legislature
to
protect
these
fish
in
their
nurseries.
this
fish
must
be
able
--
must
be
protected
from
a
net
fishery
because
it
constitute
such
a
hazard
to
the
maintenance
of
the
run.
as
i've
mentioned,
your
honor,
the
economic
value
of
the
fish
is
such
that
if
we
further
would
restrict
the
puget
sound
fishery
for
sport
and
commercial
and
we
got
more
fish
to
the
mouth
of
the
river,
we
would
merely
see
a
greater
indian
take.
and,
i
think
this
is
demonstrated
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
my
position
is,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
feasible
because,
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
i
believe
in
response
to
your
honor's
question,
the
fish
at
the
time
that
they
make
the
transition
from
salt
to
fresh
water,
tend
to
mill
and
halt.
they
actually
go
through
a
physiological
change.
the
salmon
do
in
their
upstream
ascent
to
the
spawning
grounds
and
they
will
sometimes
hold
and
the
evidence
on
this
record
and
the
opinions
of
the
experts
that
testified
in
the
trial
below,
clearly
indicate
that
this
fish
tend
to
mill
and
they
will
hold
for
three
or
four
weeks.
they
further,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
your
statement.
i
do
believe
there
are
sound
biological
or
management
reasons
for
this
state
law.
but
further,
your
honor,
i
point
out
to
you,
is
it
alright
to
–
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
-
but
would
it
be
permissible
to
rob
a
store
if
you
only
took
$50
as
opposed
to
$500.
the
question
that
i
see
it
from
my
client's
point
of
view
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
if
the
court
finds
that
he
has
this
right
then
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
regulate.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
because
the
state
would
be
then
in
the
position
(
voice
overlap)
of
defining
the
treaty
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
as
an
alternative,
i
would
offer
to
the
court
the
rationale
utilized
by
the
court
below,
but
that
is
not
my
primary
contention.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
are
you
assuming
--
oh!
may
i?
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
a
question
and
respond
to
a
question.
i
would
point
out
to
you
the
problem
of
milling
and
holding.
i
would
further
point
out
that
if
the
question
of
how
many
fish
is
left
to
the
indians,
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
sufficient
numbers
would
escape
up
the
stream
to
the
spawning
grounds,
to
perpetuate
the
run
in
anyway,
anywhere
near
the
--
a
production
level
as
opposed
to
merely
maintaining
these
species
of
fish
in
existence
and
by
that
i
mean
one
or
two
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
are
you
assuming
state
regulation,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
and
force
the
problem.
in
this
connection,
we
do
have
a
serious
problem
in
the
state
of
washington
with
regards
to
the
identification
of
members
of
these
various
38
tribes.
to
my
knowledge,
tribal
rolls
had
been
prepared
for
only
the
three
or
four
largest
tribes
and
the
smaller
tribes,
the
fragmented
groups
throughout
puget
sound,
do
not
have
membership
rolls.
this
has
created
serious
problems
in
terms
of
law
enforcement
on
the
part
of
the
game
protector.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
time
when
anyone
wants
to
fish
is
when
the
fish
is
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
in
the
opinion,
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
opinion
of
dr.
van
cleave,
the
dean
of
the
college
of
fisheries,
whose
opinion
was
corroborated
by
dr.
hamilton
and
professor
donaldson,
three
eminently
qualified
biologists
who
have
spent
their
life
in
science
studying
the
problems
of
salmon.
in
their
opinion,
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
they
give
several
reasons
for
it.
i've
already
mentioned
two.
there
are
others.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
net
fishery
which
actually
sweeps
the
spawning
area
itself,
which
of
course
are
in
these
fresh
water
streams,
even
the
fish
that
aren't
taken
tend
to
be
disturbed,
and
tend
to
spawn
unsuccessfully.
and
there's
data
in
the
record
which
studies
and
observations
which
have
been
made
by
trained
people
to
indicate
that
this
is
a
side
effect.
in
other
words,
the
fish
are
harassed
at
or
about
the
time
that
they
are
to
engage
in
the
spawning
act.
they
will
tend
to
spawn
unsuccessfully.
in
other
words,
they
will
spawn
prematurely
in
deep
water
rather
than
going
and
making
the
nest
or
the
red
in
the
gravel
in
depositing
the
eggs
and
continuing
on
in
that
manner.
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
when
is
the
steelhead
season?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
this
particular
river
system,
the
steelhead
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
they
run
december
to
march.
they
are
present
in
the
river.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
in
the
puyallup
system,
they
run
through
from
approximately
july
to
march,
your
honor.
at
the
various
species
are
--
as
adults
here
in
the
river,
not
all
times
in
the
river
you
will
have
the
juveniles
so
that
during
their
fresh
water
rearing
period
but
we
really
not
--
these
nets
do
not
affect
the
downstream
or
out
stream
migration
of
the
juveniles,
except
insofar
as
the
spawning
nests
are
disturbed
by
people
or
nets
being
dragged
across
them.
they
will
tend
to
break
up
the
nest
and
expose
the
eggs
and
they
will
then
--
you
will
have
extremely
high
mortalities
at
this
particular
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
--
in
this
river
system,
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
they
run
at
very
various
periods,
is
my
recollection.
i
just
simply
--
as
i
recall
it,
the
definition
of
a
jack
salmon
is
that
it's
simply
an
immature
salmon
or
salmon
that
came
back
a
year
too
soon
after
spending
his
salt
water
type
as
a
mature.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i'm
aware
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
regulated
with
regard
to
time,
area
and
gear.
and
i
think
in
this
connection,
it
could
be
pointed,
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
as
an
example
that
in
the
year
1942
on
the
columbia
river,
they
were
allowed
274
days
open
for
gill
netting
in
the
downstream
or
lower
portions
of
the
columbia
below
booneville
dam.
in
1967
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
all
they
could
within
the
area
that
is
open.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
fresh
water,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
is
the
only
fresh
water
fishery
for
salmon,
commercial
fishery
for
salmon
in
the
pacific
northwest.
the
reason
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
this
is
a
10%
to
the
columbia
river
compact,
your
honor,
which
is
essentially
joint
management
of
the
fishery
by
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon.
this
was
ratified
by
congress
so
that
you
have
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
established
pursuant
to
the
compact
so
that
this
particular
(voice
overlap)
will
not
apply.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
making
by
my
illustration
was
that
there
is
--
there
have
been
in
the
last
30
years
greater
and
greater
restrictions
placed
upon
both
commercial
and
sport
fisheries,
particularly
commercial.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
the
indians
are
being
regulated,
your
honor,
on
the
same
basis
as
all
other
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
but,
your
honor,
assuming,
of
course,
that
there
is
a
special
right
that
the
indians
possessed
by
virtue
of
this
treaty
language
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
record
does
not
establish
any
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
washington
with
regard
to
entry
or
use
of
gear
on
the
part
--
because
of
bloodline
ancestry.
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
that's
is
correct.
it
is
last
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
there
are
two
points
that
do
occur
to
me
as
a
result
of
your
statement.
the
first
is,
that
there
in
fact
are
numerous
indians
who
engage
in
the
salt
water
fishery
and
in
fact
quite
recently,
the
bureau
of
indians
affairs
has
obtained
apparently
the
necessary
appropriations
and
has
purchased
purse
seine
vessels
for
the
makah
tribes
and
the
makah
tribe
is
now
going
to
be
as
a
tribal
operation,
fishing
commercial
in
the
straits
juan
de
fuca.
there
are,
as
i
mentioned,
there
are
numerous
indians
who
do
engage
in
the
salt
water
fishery
and
there
was
certainly
have
no
provisional
limitation
upon
their
ability
to
do
so
if
they
so
desired.
i
think
another
point
that
should
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
has
to
do
with
the
value
of
the
fish
at
the
time
or
at
the
point
of
its
migration
where
it's
caught.
now
if
you
take
a
fish
that's
up
near
the
spawning
grounds,
you've
got
a
fish
that
is
changed
substantially
in
quality,
deteriorated
in
quality
from
that
same
bright
fish,
which
would
be
taken
in
the
salt
water.
it
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
its
bodily
energies
in
making
its
ascent
or
upstream
migration.
its
flesh,
it's
body
oils
have
been
expanded.
it's
flesh,
rather
than
being
firmed
is
soft
and
shrunky.
it
is
a
very
low
commercial
value
fish.
the
evidence,
i
believe,
is
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
some
of
this
lower
value
fish
would
go
down
as
low
as
three
to
five
cents
of
pound
for
the
first
price
to
the
fishermen
as
opposed
to
salt
water
in
the
same
value
of
thirty-five
to
forty
cents
of
pound.
these
are
very
rough
figures.
i'm
giving
you
the
exact
market
quotations
but
there
is,
there
isn't
can
be
and
it
is
a
substantial
difference
in
the
actual
economic
value
of
that
fish,
depending
upon
the
point
which
it's
taken.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
your
honor,
i
think
this
goes
back
about
ten
minutes
and
i
know
i'm
going
overtime
in
terms
of
my
colleagues,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
--
that
was
only
the
first
part
of
my
illustration.
in
1942,
the
states,
under
the
columbia
river
compact,
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
allowed
274
days
for
gill
nets
in
the
lower
columbia.
in
1967,
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon
allowed
80
days,
the
same
trend
is
apparent
on
the
puget
sound
fishery,
both
as
it
would
apply
to
purse
seine
or
drift
gill
net
type
of
fisheries.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
at
that
time,
your
honor,
the
management
agencies,
the
persons
who
are
trained
in
this
field
or
in
this
science
if
you
will,
made
the
decision
that
they
had
a
certain
escapement
goal
to
make.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
an
escapement
goal
to
make
of
so
many
fish
over
booneville
dam
of
the
various
species.
at
that
time,
the
runs
were
in
a
lot
better
shape
than
they
are
now.
so,
therefore,
they
were
able
to
meet
their
escapement
goal
and
yet
allow
this
much
fishery.
in
order
to
meet
the
same
escapement
goal
for
that
same
number
of
fish
over
booneville
dam
on
the
columbia,
they
had
to
reduce
the
fishery
on
the
various
species
in
the
columbia
on
salmon
now
from
274
days
in
1942
to
80
days
in
1967
and
those
figures
are
not
--
they
are
fairly
reflective
figures
in
terms
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
well,
your
honor,
i
keep
repeating
myself
but
the
problem
is
that
if
you
allow
a
fishery
there,
it
will
say
hypothesize
one
day
a
week
and
the
fish
that
it's
fishing,
the
stock
that
it's
fishing
is
a
stock
that's
milling
as
opposed
to
migrating,
which
is
one
reason
by
the
way,
your
honors,
that
there
is
a
fishery
allowed
in
the
lower
columbia
for
commercial
purposes
is
because
it
is
migration
water
as
opposed
to
holding
water.
this
fish
do
not
stop
in
their
migrations.
they
don't
begin
to
stop
until
they
are
up
either
in
the
mouth
of
these
rivers
they've
already
made
their
salt
to
fresh
transition
in
their
life
cycle
and
they
don't
begin
to
hold
up
until
they
begin
to
get
up
into
the
tributaries
either
above
booneville
or
up
the
water
limit
or
one
of
the
other
tributaries
in
the
lower
columbia.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
not
in
the
columbia
nor
anywhere
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
no,
by
area,
by
area
prohibition
and
this
is
what
this
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
there
is
no
commercial
fishing
permitted
in
fresh
water
in
the
state
of
washington,
with
the
exception
of
the
lower
columbia,
which
is,
as
i
mentioned,
under
this
columbia
river
compact
jointly
managed
by
the
two
states.
i'm
way
overtime
and
i
don't
want
to
deprive
my
colleagues
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
it
is
a
complicated
thing,
your
honor.
it's
something
that
we
have
–
within
the
state
of
washington
and
i'm
sure
in
oregon
and
idaho
also,
we've
delegated
this
management,
responsibilities
to
persons
who
are
trained
in
this
area
or
in
this
field
to
act.
if
they
act
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
or
don't
do
their
jobs
–-
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff
my
answer
would
be
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
