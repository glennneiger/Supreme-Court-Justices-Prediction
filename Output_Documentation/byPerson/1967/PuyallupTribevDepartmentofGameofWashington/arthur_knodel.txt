mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
supreme
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
subject
matter
is
the
medicine
creek
treaty
of
1854.
this
is
a
treaty
that
was
entered
into
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
puyallup
indians,
the
nisqually
indians
and
others.
the
primary
issue
that
is
before
the
court
as
we
see
them
is
first
of
all,
can
the
state
of
washington,
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power,
pass
and
enforce
such
fishing
regulations
so
as
to
effectively
repeal
that
provision
in
the
medicine
creek
treaty
that
guaranteed
to
these
indians
the
fishing
right.
the
second
question
is
do
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
this
matter
in
such
case
where
they
have
not
obtained
the
consent
of
the
indians
or
the
consent
of
the
federal
government.
i
think,
in
order
to
get
a
little
more
to
my
point,
i'm
going
to
take
short
five,
six
minutes
to
cover
the
backgrounds
and
facts
of
the
case.
in
this
particular
case,
when
the
medicine
creek
treaty
was
negotiated
with
the
various,
the
tribes,
the
puyallup
tribe
and
the
nisqually
tribe,
the
indians
relinquished
to
the
united
states
government
thousands
of
acres
of
land
upon
which
were
very
valuable
timber
lands
and
in
turn,
the
indians
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
fish
and
in
addition,
they
also
reserved
a
small
piece
of
land
that
they
picked
as
a
reservation
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
picking
of
the
reservation
at
the
point
like
many
other
indians
up
and
down
the
coast,
they
selected
that
not
because
of
accident,
but
by
necessity.
now
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
government
large
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
relinquished
their
right
to
be
in
this
particular
area
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
there
has
been
a
war
between
the
indians
and
the
settlers
actually
and
in
consideration
of
everybody
living
peacefully
and
giving
up
this
conflict
that
had
been
going
on,
the
indians
agreed
that
they
would
step
out
of
this
large
area
of
land
and
relinquish
it
to
the
united
states
and
they
would
go
on
a
red
reserve
or
reservation
where
the
united
states
would
guarantee
their
peaceful
existence
and
out
of
this
reservation,
they
could
then
exercise
this
particular
fishing
right.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
under
the
treaty,
under
this
medicine
creek
treaty,
i
think
too
provides
that
they
have
the
right
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
it
is
a
federal
statute
or
it's
probably
more
than
that
if
the
worcester
versus
georgia
case
gave
the
same
effect
to
indian
treaties
as
it
did
to
foreign
treaties
although
i
realize
that
we
have
a
little
different
situation
here
considered,
but
it
is
a
genuine
treaty
that
was
executed
by
the
united
states
government.
governor
stevens
is
a
man
who
engineered
it
for
the
united
states
and
the
indians,
of
course
signed
it.
president
pierce
approved
it
and
congress,
of
course,
ratified
it.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
the
puyallupians,
as
was
testified
by
the
state's
anthropologist,
doctor
tiller,
the
indians
were
on
living
in
this
area,
puyallup
area,
for
500
hundred
years
before
the
medicine
creek
treaty.
they
were
using
various
fishing
gear
and
such.
i
think
the
important
provision
of
the
treaty
is
the
fish,
of
course,
because
this
is
what
the
indians
were
really
bargaining
for.
this
is
what
they
were
really
working
for,
hold
negotiations
with
this
and
the
record
would
show,
as
testified,
the
minutes,
the
treaty
itself
shows
that
the
fish
were
the
main
item
of
bargain
and
the
reason
it
was
because
these
indians
had
to
have
a
fish
to
survive.
had,
this
treaty
left
out
the
provision
of
the
right
to
obtain
and
abandon
the
supply
of
fish,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court
because
the
indians
would've
starved
to
death.
i
think
the
best
statement
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they,
in
1854,
they
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
right
now.
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
yes,
they
-
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
they
operate,
they
catch
the
fish
for
their
own
consumption
and
they
sell
them
on
market,
that's
correct.
that's
up
to
the
time
we
were
totally
and
completely
restraining
from
taking
any
other
fish.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
what
we
are
seeking
is
this.
we
maintain
that
under
the
medicine
creek
treaty,
we
were
given
this
treaty
right
to
fish.
and
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is,
the
--
if
i'll
point
this
out
to
the
court,
i
think
it
will
better
answer
your
question.
there'd
been
quite
a
number
of
impacts
upon
this
fish
that
was
not
anticipated
originally
when
the
medicine
creek
treaty
was
signed.
the
indirect
impacts,
for
example,
the
puyallup
river
has
a
lot
of
its
spawning
grounds
destroyed,
manmade
obstructions
had
been
placed
in
their
and
also
pollution.
then,
there
has
been
since
this
that
the
indians
could
not
anticipate
and
all
matters
brought
about
the
state
is
a
tremendous
commercial
and
sports
fishery
upon
this
group
of,
this
fish
run
that
the
indians
depend
upon.
the
salmon
is
a
fish
that
will
hatch
in
river
and
then
it
will
proceed
out
to
the
ocean
and
then
it
will
return
to
its
spawning
grounds
and
there
the
salmon
dies,
of
course,
except
the
steelhead
doesn't.
what
happened
in
this
case
to
get
to
your
question
is
this.
after
the
salmon
leaves
the
puyallup
river
after
its
--
avoided
all
these
ruinous
indirect
impacts
and
goes
off
to
sea
and
then
returns
from
the
ocean
after
it's
been
exposed
to
the
various
natural
hazards,
been
exposed
to
the
international
fisheries,
the
japanese,
russian
and
canadian
fisheries,
and
it
come
down
from
through
here
and
at
that
particular
point,
they
come
into,
i
guess
you
could
call
it
“washington
state
waters.”
what
happens
is
you
then
have
three
competing
groups
for
that
particular
fish.
you
have
the
washington
state
commercial
group,
which
is
the
largest
taking
group,
the
sports
fish
regroup
and
the
treaty
indian
fishing
group.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
now
is
quite
obviously
in
order
to
keep
this
run
going,
you've
got
to
get
a
certain
number
of
fish
up
the
river
to
spawn
so
they
can
repeat
this
particular
cycle.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
as
these
fish
move
down,
in
the
state
of
washington,
in
its
program
what
they
call
“conservation”,
they
allowed
the
fish
for
the
sportsmen
and
fish
for
the
commercial
interest
and
by
the
time
the
fish
get
down
here
to
what
they
call
the
way
down
in
the
corner
right
of
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
and
going
into
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
state
of
washington
says:
“in
the
interest
of
conservation,
we
can't
let
the
indians
have
one
single
fish
because
we
must
take
all
of
the
fish”
and
in
this
case,
what
they
did,
the
state
cast
rules
and
regulations
that
prohibited
any
type
of
net
fishery
in
this
particular
river
and
right
in
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
they
don't.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
but
we
want
--
our
argument
is
this.
let
more
fish
escape
so
we
have
fish.
don't
practice
conversation
on
the
indians,
conservation
for
the
commercial
interest
and
the
sports
interest
leaving
the
indians
out.
now,
the
federal
court
interpreting
this
very
point,
our
federal
points
out
in
the
west
coast,
they
applied
what
they
call
the
indispensable
test.
the
state
court
in
this
particular
case
applied
the
reasonable
necessary
test.
they
said
obviously,
it's
reasonable
and
necessary
that
by
that
time
the
fish
escapes
all
these
various
hazards
and
get
down
to
this
particular
point,
then
they
have
to
go
up
the
river.
in
the
umatilla
case,
maison
versus
umatilla
case
determined
by
the
ninth
circuit
said,
“before
you
start
regulating
this
treaty
indian
fishing
right,
and
there
they
interpret
a
very
similar
treaty
provision,
medicine
creek
treaty
was
one
of
the
first
of
the
series
of
treaties
involving
similar
type
of
people
and
similar
situation
and
what
they
did
in
that
case,
they
said:
“you
can't
start
on
the
other
end
and
say,
you're
not
going
to
leave
any
fish
for
the
indians.
you've
got
to
first
of
all
show
that
the
rules
and
regulations
you
are
applying
are
indispensable”.
in
other
words,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
umatilla
case,
which
makes
sense,
the
indians
had
bargained
and
this
was
principle
essence
of
that
treaty
that
we
would
get
an
abundant
supply
of
fish.
now,
the
fish
we
were
taking,
just
so
the
record
is
clear,
out
of
these
competing
group
of
individuals,
the
washington
commercial
group,
washington
sports
group
and
the
treaty
indian
groups,
out
of
that
catch,
the
total
catch,
we
get
3%
to
5%,
that's
all
we
were
taking.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
the
ultimate
argument
what
the
state
says
“will
happen.”
i
mean,
they
say
ultimately
this
will
happen
that
all
the
fish
will
be
caught.
there
had
been
escapements
all
along
throughout
this
period
of
time
because
of
the
peculiarity
of
the
river,
the
indians
can't
be
fishing
with
their
nets
and
these
nets
are
worked
on
the
outgoing
type
primarily.
there
is
some
escapement
and
the
point,
the
answer
to
that
question
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
do.
however,
of
course,
the
salmon,
being
peculiar
will
run
a
different
times
of
the
year
depending
on
the
species
or
the
races.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
they
use
these
gill
nets
and
they
do
catch
this
fish.
for
example,
the
testimony
of
dr.
lasator
at
the
trial
was
that
in
one
particular
year,
the
sports
fishermen
cut
18,500
steelhead
directly
behind
the
indian
fisheries
while
the
indians
took
1,500
steelhead.
in
answering
the
question,
it's
this:
i
think
that
what
we're
saying
we
don't
take
the
position
that
we
should
take
every
fish
that
comes.
the
indians
--
the
only
thing
the
indians
are
asking
is
that
the
treaty
be
given
its
interpretation
what
it
was
intended
to,
namely
that
we
got
a
right
to
catch
an
abundant
supply
of
fish
so
we
can
feed
and
supply
the
necessities
of
the
tribe.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
does.
the
indians
sold
commercially
in
1854.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into,
this
was
the
primary
--
the
indians
did
got
with
the
sale
of
fish;
they
supplied
the
settlers
with
fish
and
this
was
part
of
their
program.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
fish
was
it.
like
the
court
said
in
the
winans
case,
fish
was
so
important
to
these
people
and
that
was
important
as
they
--
brief.
mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
tribe
is
the
first
to
admit
that
we
shouldn't
take
it
all,
all
the
fish
that
go
up
the
river.
we're
not
attempting
to
say
that
we
don't
want
to
share
with
anyone.
this
has
never
been
the
indians'
position.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
would
say
that
what
should
happen
in
this
particular
case,
the
indians
should
be
permitted
to
set
up
their
regulations,
which
regulations
are,
of
course,
submitted
to
the
federal
government
and
that
at
that
particular
time
if
it
develops
that
the
indians
are
incapable
of
handling
the
problem,
congress
is
the
ultimate
where
this
situation
could
be
remedied.
congress
could
take
away
this
right,
but
the
umatilla,
the
one
maison
versus
umatilla,
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
used
the
term
“indispensable.”
what
that
case,
as
far
as
i
can
understand,
said,
“give
--
it's
indispensable
to
us
that
they
first
give
us
a
portion
of
the
share.”
i
fully
realized
it's
difficult
to
say
how
much
amounts
to
substantial
needs,
however,
in
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
could
conceivably.
this
is
true
but
again,
like
everything
else,
it
is
certainly
subject
to
certain
regulations
which
could
be
worked
out.
now
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
i
think
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty
is
that
these
people
made
a
living
and
that's
all
the
puyallups
are
now
entitled
to
even
the
nisqually,
it's
just
a
living;
and
you
have
350
members.
quite
obviously,
when
you
take
3%
to
5%
---
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
but
see,
what
we
did
when
we
took
over
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true.
but
you
see
what
society
did
or
more
or
less
what
we
did
to
the
indians,
we
said,
“now
you
adopt
our
western
civilization.”
i
mean,
our
schools
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
would
have
to
be
measured
by
reasonable
application,
probably
through
the
federal
government
and
the
state.
now,
when
you
take
a
look
for
example,
the
ideal
situation
is
for
example
the
canadians
have
an
agreement
with
the
same
fishery,
the
japanese,
the
russians
are
involved,
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
washington.
so
you
see
you
have
more
groups,
more
competing
groups
but
what
we
are
concerned
about,
we
don't
mind
the
indispensable
class
and
we
don't
mind
having
this
matter
go
to
federal
courts
where
the
federal
courts
say,
“well,
we
think
that
the
abundance
as
of
this
particular
point,
what
we
don't
want
to
have
is
being
in
a
position
where
the
state
of
washington
says
like
they're
entitled
to
enact
whatever
reasonable
legislation
is
necessary.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
they
prohibited
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true
but
the
problem
you've
got
is
that
the
hook
and
line
system
is
very
inefficient
when
the
fish
reach
this
particular
point
as
was
testified
to
by
the
state.
you
can't
possibly
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
that's
correct,
they're
going
upward.
mr.
arthur
knodel
not
on
the
other
side,
no.
these
fish
are
exposed
to
all
types
of
sports
fishery
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
after
we
get
to
be
a
certain
size.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
my
position
in
this
case
that
this
is
a
treaty
and
a
right
it's
federal
domain
and
i
think
only
the
federal
government
can
control.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
my
thinking
that
in
order
to
really
save
the
salmon,
it
is
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
take
a
very
active
part
in
helping
preserve
this
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
would
be
correct
to
an
extent.
however,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we've
been
asking,
the
thing
we
haven't
been
getting
is
an
adequate
number
of
fish
and
the
state
has
gradually
pecked
away
at
this
all
the
way
through
and
now
they
finally
got
it
down
to
the
point
where
they
said,
“we
reject
the
attitude
of
the
federal
courts
in
this
particular
area
in
applying
the
maison
versus
umatilla
case,
we're
going
to
reside
that
it
has
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary
and
the
reasonable
necessary
test
means,
as
the
lower
court
indicated,
we
put
it
that
--
the
court
put
in
this
effect
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
indian
fishery.
and
the
only
effective
way
to
catch
fish
is
by
the
methods
that
the
state,
by
its
regulations,
has
prohibited.
mr.
arthur
knodel
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
presented,
if
you
look
at
the
state's
brief,
you
will
notice
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
right,
that
they
restrained
them
from,
this
is
correct,
net
fishery
but
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
answer
is,
the
entire
--
the
injunction
totally
restrained
and
prohibited
the
use
of
any
nets
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
--
in
this
area.
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
any
rules
or
regulations,
but
it
totally
prohibited
the
use
of
any
nets
in
this
common
area
of
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
there
is
a
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
i
should,
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
what
i'm
talking
about
is
this,
when
you
catch
with
trawl
then
of
course
you'll
have
--
it's
very
inefficient
because
when
the
fish
starts
spawning
as
when
you
get
them,
you
catch
very
few.
and
to
catch
this
type
of
fish,
it
would
impossible
for
them
to
survive.
traditionally,
they
have
used
the
net
method
of
fishing.
i
see
my
--
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
that
particular
run
would
be
wiped
out
if
it
were
destroyed.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
the
only
problem
we
have
is
now
at
the
states
doing,
we're
taking
3%
and
5%
of
those
fish
now.
so
it
depends
where
you
call
a
spawning
fish
like
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
we're
talking
about
the
puyallup
fish
run,
3%
to
5%.
mr.
arthur
knodel
between
the
commercial
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
amount
we
take,
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
would
be
a
different
figure,
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
regulated.
they
vary
from
time
to
time.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct
but
their
nets
come
down
to
within
two
miles
of
the
puyallup
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
let
me
state
that
i
can
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
having
an
adequate,
having
such
ruling
that
would
impose
upon
the
indians
the
duty
or
a
restriction
to
permit
a
proper
escapement
to
continue
this
run
of
salmon
because
no
group
wants
to
maintain
that
salmon
run
more
than
the
indians.
there
is
nothing
–
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
think
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
think
this
is
--
the
state's
testimony
repeatedly
showed
that
they
had
different
--
they
have
a
fish
biologist
showed
how
they
could
follow
this
fish
down
the
straits,
the
puyallup
run
or
any
other
run
and
then
select
from
that
run
as
they
proceed
down
into
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup.
let
me
point
to
the
court
and
it
probably
answers
this
question
little
more
indirectly.
this
is
the
map
of
the
puget
sound
area.
this
is
the
area
what
they
referred
to
as
commencement
bay.
commencement
bay
is
a
52
square
mile
area
and
your
fishing
in
approximately
commercial
fishing
ends
approximately
two
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river.
this
red
line
here
is
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
puyallup
indian
reservation
which
has
never
been
terminated
by
any
act
of
congress.
the
state
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
a
reservation
in
this
sense.
there
was
a
general
allotment
act.
in
that
general
allotment
act,
the
various
area
was
allotted
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
much
of
the
land
is
still
owned
by
the
indians
themselves
as
allotments
in
the
course
of
the
tribe
itself
owns
the
land
within.
but
anything,
this
was
an
article
ii
granted
to
the
indians
of
the
medicine
creek
treaty
as
their
exclusive
right.
they
reserved
this
in
which
they
can
live
peacefully
and
which
they
could
fish
from.
now,
the
fishing
right
is
a
communal
right
that
belongs
to
the
tribe
itself
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
have
never
been
--
the
fishing
rights
never
been
abandoned
by
them,
it
has
never
been
terminated
by
the
federal
government
just
like
federal
government
has
never
terminated
the
reservation.
and
there
is
a
termination
statute
which
specifically
provides
that
the
federal
government
can
terminate
a
reservation
or
can
terminate
a
tribe.
one
other
thing
i
wish
to
bring
out
is
these
fish,
when
they
proceed
up
to
puyallup
river,
the
fishing
actually,
the
puyallup
fishery
actually
ends
just
on
the
other
side
of
what
we
call
the
clarks
pink
bridge
with
approximately
three
miles
up
from
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river,
from
the
mouth
of
the
river.
these
fish
then
proceed
up
and
spawn.
there
is
no
spawning
in
this
area
at
all,
there's
none.
there's
no
spawning
inside
this
particular
area
here.
the
fish
proceed
up
to
other
crate.
the
state
showed
yesterday
a
rather
detailed,
it
is
here,
on
these
tributaries.
the
fish
will
travel,
like
i
say,
40
to
50
miles
up
and
then
they
will
go
to
these
various
branches:
the
white
river,
the
stock
river,
the
clark
river,
numerous
rivers
that
they
do.
but
one
thing
i
want
to
submit
to
the
court
is
this:
that
assuming
the
court
rules
that
the
state
does
have
the
right
through
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
to
totally
restrict
the
off
reservation
fishing
or
the
“in
common”
fishing,
this
is
not
going
to
resolve
the
problem.
because
of
this,
there
are
in
addition
to
the
puyallup
reservation,
there
are
17
other
reservations
in
the
state
and
as
it
turned
out,
the
fish,
the
greatest
number
of
fish
always
happen
to
be
going
into
the
reservation
area,
in
the
area
that
the
indians
have
their
fishing
exclusively
and
as
the
state
has
indicated,
“exclusively”.
they
concede,
everybody
agrees
here
that
on
a
reservation,
the
indians
have
the
right
to
fish
unrestricted.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
the
state
takes
the
position
that
the
puyallup
reservation
no
longer
exists,
their
position
is
that.
however,
they
do
recognize
for
example
the
quinault
reservation
and
other
reservations.
the
state
says
those
exist,
but
what
the
state
is
doing
is
gradually
taking
away
the
fishing
rights
of
the
indians.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
under
section
iii,
we
were
given
the
right
to
fish
in
common
with
other
citizens.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
it's
a
highly
industrialized
area.
mr.
arthur
knodel
there's
a
lot
of
different
people.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
law
practice
is
at
(inaudible)
within
that
area.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
sold
and
exchanged
and
this
is
the
theory
under
which
the
state
claims
the
reservation
does
not
exists
because
it
has
been
sold
or
because
they've
been
declared
citizens.
it's
our
contention
that
this
is
not
the
law
based
on
the
seymour
case,
which
this
court
ruled
was
the
only
congress
could
act.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
area
as
(voice
overlap)
afforded
in
the
medicine
creek
treaty,
1,280
acres.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
sir,
according
to
the
medicine
creek
treaty.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
this
is
approximately
correct.
i
believe
i
--
but
this
is
the
area
(voice
overlap).
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
a
3-mile
area
that
the
indians
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
a
3-mile
area
that
the
indians
have
in
fishing
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
up
to
the
point
up
here,
it's
approximately
3
miles.
it's
the
area
the
indian
net
fishery
has
been
taking
place.
they
see
--
the
problem
i
think
is
this
that
some
place
down
the
line,
it's
our
contention
that
this
whole
field
of
indian
matter
arising
out
of
the
constitution,
the
constitution,
it's
our
position,
we're
dealing
with
treaty,
we're
dealing
with
indians,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
federal
domain
and
the
point
is
this.
if
this
supreme
court
makes
the
finding
that
the
indians
do
have
a
right,
that
they
do
have
this
treaty
right
as
we
believe
we
have,
and
then
places
upon
the
federal
government
the
position
that
they
assist
in
these
regulations
and
they
work
with
us.
now
the
interesting
thing
about
it,
this
has
been
such
a
conflict
on
this
point
that
the
federal
government
did
not
come
in
to
help
these
indians
until
at
the
state
supreme
court
level.
the
situation
got
to
the
point
where
they
felt
they
had
to
intervene.
but
here
we
are,
indians,
we're
sitting,
we
got
a
treaty,
we've
got
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
government,
a
promise
from
them
and
what
happens?
the
federal
government
isn't
fighting
with
the
state
or
they
don't
want
to
get
too
far
involved.
they
feel
the
law
is
too
vague
or
something.
the
state
in
turn
keeps
very
actively
going.
now
if
the
court
rules
that
the
state
can
prohibit
our
fishing
right,
our
treaty
right
by
regulations,
then
we
are
in
the
ridiculous
position
that
–
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
at
the
trial,
the
states'
testimony,
the
testimony
was
that
there
was
a
net
fishing
by
dr.
tiller.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
--
this
was
also
introduced
the
general
accounting,
the
breakdown.
in
1854,
congress
or
part
of
the
contribution
or
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
an
allowance
for
nets
in
seines.
it
actually
provided
for
that.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true
it
doesn't
but
by
the
same
token,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
not
sure
they
would
not
let
them
fish
with
their
fish
wares
or
their
various
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
provided
they
use
the
same
equipment
that
the
states
says
they're
allowed
to
use.
the
only
thing
is
this.
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
thing
that
our
argument
or
complaint
is
this
that
when
this
treaty
was
entered
into,
this
fish
bargain
for
this
abandoned
fish
supply.
now
what's
happen
is
through
this
indirect
impact,
the
state
has
brought
about
a
tremendous
fishing
fleet,
a
tremendous
commercial
fishing
fleet
that
makes
the
fish
that
we
take
look
very,
very
small.
we
catch
a
very
small
portion
of
the
fish,
but
the
states'
old
procedure
of
fishing
has
increased.
they've
got
new
modern
boats.
they
got
all
this
modern
equipment.
they
have
nets
that,
as
testified
at
the
trial,
they
can
take
2500
fish.
we
have
purse
seines
at
one
time,
they
could
put
three
purse
seines
in
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
i
would
say
that.
i
would
say
we're
the
smallest.
mr.
arthur
knodel
first,
you
have
many
commercial
fishermen
fishing
but
this
would
be
relatively
small,
yes.
because
by
the
time
you
stop
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i
would
say
there
are
smaller.
it
depends
on
the
nets
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
what?
mr.
arthur
knodel
well
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
if
you
compare
to
the
huge
fleets
that
go
out,
some
of
these
boats
are
fantastic,
the
amount
of
fish
they
take.
mr.
arthur
knodel
at
the
trial,
it
was
shown
that
70
different
families
fish
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
seventy
different
families
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
fish
commercially
in
this
usual
and
accustomed
ground.
now
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
talking
about
the
puyallups,
yes.
now,
the
one
thing
it
affects
all
of
them
but
this
is
something
everybody
losses
sight
of.
is
this
fishing
by
the
puyallups
has
been
under
considerable
harassment,
after
the
satiacum
case
came
down
in
1953,
up
to
that
point,
the
state
was
continuously
arresting
and
taking
indians.
satiacum
was
arrested
in
1953.
the
state
of
washington,
by
a
split
decision,
determined
that
satiacum
was
released
and
then
the
indians
proceeded
to
fish
more.
this
is
true.
they
had
fished
prior
to
that
time
but
it
was
a
continuous
harassment
by
the
state.
then
what
happened
was,
since
then,
as
the
records
will
show,
the
state
has
been
openly
watching
and
doing
everything
possible,
gathering
it's
facts,
it's
data
to
come
back
in
and
select
another
time
and
another
day
to
come
back
and
move
in.
this
has
made
the
fishing
such
a
difficult
position
for
these
indian
people
that
it's
been
difficult
for
them
to
possibly
work
on
it.
we've
also
had
the
problem
that
the
federal
government
has
been
rather
weak
in
this
particular
field
because
they
haven't
really
known
exactly
what
they
should
be
doing,
but
i
think
once
the
court
determines
that
this
is
a
right,
that
the
right
is
there
and
it's
certainly
our
contention
that
this
is
the
federal
area
and
this
will
be
taken
cared
of
in
the
state
of
washing
--
oregon
will
go
ahead
and
resolve
this
problem.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i'm
not
asking
that
they
overrule
that
because
the
state
supreme
court
made
a
finding
there
was
tribe,
were
organized
and
recognized
by
the
federal
government
as
there's
350
members
of
the
puyallup
indian
tribe?
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
don't
all
live
at
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
within
the
area?
mr.
arthur
knodel
now
i
would
be
guessing.
i
would
say
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
yes,
definitely.
i
would
say
there
would
be
probably
a
125
to
150.
they're
quite
a
few.
yes,
about
a
125.
mr.
arthur
knodel
as
i
indicated
that
70
participate.
it's
true,
it's
definitely
true
that
three
of
them
have
been
doing
the
major
fishing.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
know
whether
i
understand
the
question
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
tribal
position
that
this
is
a
communal
right.
the
on
reservation
fishing,
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing,
this
is
subject
to
control
by
the
tribe.
and
if
the
tribe
determines
to
cut
down
or
whatever
the
tribe
determines
to
do,
the
tribe
has
that
right
because
it
is
a
tribal
right.
it
doesn't
belong
to
any
individual.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
not.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
are
interested
because
they
have
certain
tribal
people
that
are
fishing,
that
are
interested
in
this
particular
fishing
right
and
these
are
part
of
the
tribe
and
if
these
men
are
restrained
or
prohibited
from
fishing,
then
of
course,
we
have
the
problem
that
the
other
members
loss
their
right
too.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
again,
like
i
say
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
tribe
has
its
regulations.
yes,
there
are
regulations
or
that
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
as
to
the
fishing,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
there's
certain
length
of
nets
and
so
various
different
items.
now,
we've
had
one
problem
with
that
which
i
--
is
it
so
much
alright
for
me
to
continue?
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
problem
we've
had
is
this.
the
puyallup
tribe
prepared
these
regulations,
the
governing
tribal
counsel.
these
regulations
were
submitted
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
at
that
time
they
were
submitted
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
which
was
a
good
member
years
ago,
a
problem
developed
because
of
all
the
uncertainty
in
this
particular
field.
as
to
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
and
the
state's
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
regulate,
federal
government
had
no
right
in
this
area,
then
as
a
result,
no
action
was
taken.
now,
anything
the
tribe
does,
we
have
to
do
through
because
we
are
more
or
less
created
or
treaty
as
with
the
united
states
government.
we've
got
to
do
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
what's
happened,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
federal
government
has
just
been
slow
to
get
around
to
this
problem
if
they
just
haven't
caught
up,
i
guess.
now,
there's
starting
to
and
you
will
notice
how
they
came
in
on
passing
these
regulations,
these
other
regulations
they
submitted
and
also
they
entered
this
case
when
we
got
to
the
state
supreme
court.
so,
what
i'm
saying,
now
that
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
position
or
this
court
clears
the
air
and
says,
“well,
this
is
a
treaty
right
and
if
the
indians
do
have
a
right
to
fish,
this
is
a
federal
government
area.
you're
going
to
have
the
federal
government
come
into
this
and
assist
these
tribes
in
proper
and
decent
conservation.
you're
going
to
have
on
the
reservations
anyhow
so
this
is
just
as
good
a
place
to
start
as
any”.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
sorry,
i
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
claim
that
the
federal
government
has
recognized
these
people
as
a
tribe
since
1854.
they've
always
had
a
form
of
government,
the
federal
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
a
consul,
who
is
a
very
active
consul.
they
are
present
in
the
court
now.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
an
active
consul,
five
consul
men.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
no
police
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
part
of
the
area
is
part
of
the
city
of
tacoma.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
of
course,
our
taking
is
that
this
is
a
property
right
as
much
as
similar
to
the
land.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
in
1929,
the
puyallups
recurred
a
tribal
roll
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
--
and
in
order
to
prepare,
hearings
were
had
to
bring
the
various
people
up
to,
you
know,
to
determine
whether
they
were
members
of
the
tribe
and
after
they
had
arrived
at
that
decision,
this
roll
was
completed
and
in
the
by-laws
it
states
that
no
one
–
“that
in
order
to
be
a
member
of
the
tribe,
you
would
have
to
be
born
within
radius
of
20
miles
from
the
indian
hospital”,
which
is
right
in
the
heart
of
the,
right
next
[inaudible]
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
that
roll
was
accepted
and
recognized
the
tribe.
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
establish
who
is
a
member
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
point
is,
the
matter
that
it
didn't
get
into
the
brief
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
ruled
there
was
a
tribe.
so
the
matters
that
came
up
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
what
right
does
the
state
of
washington
have
to
regulate
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
grounds
and
the
fishing
rights
of
the
puyallup
indians.
this
is
the
matter
before
the
court
so
i
didn't
submit
anything
on
this
particular
matter.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
individually,
the
tribe
itself
as
a
tribe,
i
mean,
they
exercise
it
as
individuals,
the
members
of
that
tribe
themselves.
any
member
of
that
tribe
wants
to
exercise
this
fishing
right
can
go
ahead
and
do
it.
now,
mr.
satiacum
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
they
haven't.
they
haven't.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
that
right.
this
is
true,
but
again,
like
i
say,
we
take
this
position
that
this
is
kind
of
a
property
right
that
stays
like
a
piece
of
real
estate
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
the
united
states
government
has
recognized
them
as
a
tribe
and
part
of
the
treaty.
mr.
arthur
knodel
and
part
of
the
treaty
was
that
they
did
have
this
fishing
right.
this
was
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
supreme
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
subject
matter
is
the
medicine
creek
treaty
of
1854.
this
is
a
treaty
that
was
entered
into
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
puyallup
indians,
the
nisqually
indians
and
others.
the
primary
issue
that
is
before
the
court
as
we
see
them
is
first
of
all,
can
the
state
of
washington,
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power,
pass
and
enforce
such
fishing
regulations
so
as
to
effectively
repeal
that
provision
in
the
medicine
creek
treaty
that
guaranteed
to
these
indians
the
fishing
right.
the
second
question
is
do
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
this
matter
in
such
case
where
they
have
not
obtained
the
consent
of
the
indians
or
the
consent
of
the
federal
government.
i
think,
in
order
to
get
a
little
more
to
my
point,
i'm
going
to
take
short
five,
six
minutes
to
cover
the
backgrounds
and
facts
of
the
case.
in
this
particular
case,
when
the
medicine
creek
treaty
was
negotiated
with
the
various,
the
tribes,
the
puyallup
tribe
and
the
nisqually
tribe,
the
indians
relinquished
to
the
united
states
government
thousands
of
acres
of
land
upon
which
were
very
valuable
timber
lands
and
in
turn,
the
indians
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
fish
and
in
addition,
they
also
reserved
a
small
piece
of
land
that
they
picked
as
a
reservation
at
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
picking
of
the
reservation
at
the
point
like
many
other
indians
up
and
down
the
coast,
they
selected
that
not
because
of
accident,
but
by
necessity.
now
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
government
large
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
relinquished
their
right
to
be
in
this
particular
area
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
there
has
been
a
war
between
the
indians
and
the
settlers
actually
and
in
consideration
of
everybody
living
peacefully
and
giving
up
this
conflict
that
had
been
going
on,
the
indians
agreed
that
they
would
step
out
of
this
large
area
of
land
and
relinquish
it
to
the
united
states
and
they
would
go
on
a
red
reserve
or
reservation
where
the
united
states
would
guarantee
their
peaceful
existence
and
out
of
this
reservation,
they
could
then
exercise
this
particular
fishing
right.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
under
the
treaty,
under
this
medicine
creek
treaty,
i
think
too
provides
that
they
have
the
right
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
it
is
a
federal
statute
or
it's
probably
more
than
that
if
the
worcester
versus
georgia
case
gave
the
same
effect
to
indian
treaties
as
it
did
to
foreign
treaties
although
i
realize
that
we
have
a
little
different
situation
here
considered,
but
it
is
a
genuine
treaty
that
was
executed
by
the
united
states
government.
governor
stevens
is
a
man
who
engineered
it
for
the
united
states
and
the
indians,
of
course
signed
it.
president
pierce
approved
it
and
congress,
of
course,
ratified
it.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
the
puyallupians,
as
was
testified
by
the
state's
anthropologist,
doctor
tiller,
the
indians
were
on
living
in
this
area,
puyallup
area,
for
500
hundred
years
before
the
medicine
creek
treaty.
they
were
using
various
fishing
gear
and
such.
i
think
the
important
provision
of
the
treaty
is
the
fish,
of
course,
because
this
is
what
the
indians
were
really
bargaining
for.
this
is
what
they
were
really
working
for,
hold
negotiations
with
this
and
the
record
would
show,
as
testified,
the
minutes,
the
treaty
itself
shows
that
the
fish
were
the
main
item
of
bargain
and
the
reason
it
was
because
these
indians
had
to
have
a
fish
to
survive.
had,
this
treaty
left
out
the
provision
of
the
right
to
obtain
and
abandon
the
supply
of
fish,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court
because
the
indians
would've
starved
to
death.
i
think
the
best
statement
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they,
in
1854,
they
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
right
now.
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
yes,
they
-
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
they
operate,
they
catch
the
fish
for
their
own
consumption
and
they
sell
them
on
market,
that's
correct.
that's
up
to
the
time
we
were
totally
and
completely
restraining
from
taking
any
other
fish.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
what
we
are
seeking
is
this.
we
maintain
that
under
the
medicine
creek
treaty,
we
were
given
this
treaty
right
to
fish.
and
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is,
the
--
if
i'll
point
this
out
to
the
court,
i
think
it
will
better
answer
your
question.
there'd
been
quite
a
number
of
impacts
upon
this
fish
that
was
not
anticipated
originally
when
the
medicine
creek
treaty
was
signed.
the
indirect
impacts,
for
example,
the
puyallup
river
has
a
lot
of
its
spawning
grounds
destroyed,
manmade
obstructions
had
been
placed
in
their
and
also
pollution.
then,
there
has
been
since
this
that
the
indians
could
not
anticipate
and
all
matters
brought
about
the
state
is
a
tremendous
commercial
and
sports
fishery
upon
this
group
of,
this
fish
run
that
the
indians
depend
upon.
the
salmon
is
a
fish
that
will
hatch
in
river
and
then
it
will
proceed
out
to
the
ocean
and
then
it
will
return
to
its
spawning
grounds
and
there
the
salmon
dies,
of
course,
except
the
steelhead
doesn't.
what
happened
in
this
case
to
get
to
your
question
is
this.
after
the
salmon
leaves
the
puyallup
river
after
its
--
avoided
all
these
ruinous
indirect
impacts
and
goes
off
to
sea
and
then
returns
from
the
ocean
after
it's
been
exposed
to
the
various
natural
hazards,
been
exposed
to
the
international
fisheries,
the
japanese,
russian
and
canadian
fisheries,
and
it
come
down
from
through
here
and
at
that
particular
point,
they
come
into,
i
guess
you
could
call
it
“washington
state
waters.”
what
happens
is
you
then
have
three
competing
groups
for
that
particular
fish.
you
have
the
washington
state
commercial
group,
which
is
the
largest
taking
group,
the
sports
fish
regroup
and
the
treaty
indian
fishing
group.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
now
is
quite
obviously
in
order
to
keep
this
run
going,
you've
got
to
get
a
certain
number
of
fish
up
the
river
to
spawn
so
they
can
repeat
this
particular
cycle.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
as
these
fish
move
down,
in
the
state
of
washington,
in
its
program
what
they
call
“conservation”,
they
allowed
the
fish
for
the
sportsmen
and
fish
for
the
commercial
interest
and
by
the
time
the
fish
get
down
here
to
what
they
call
the
way
down
in
the
corner
right
of
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river
and
going
into
the
mouth
of
the
river,
the
state
of
washington
says:
“in
the
interest
of
conservation,
we
can't
let
the
indians
have
one
single
fish
because
we
must
take
all
of
the
fish”
and
in
this
case,
what
they
did,
the
state
cast
rules
and
regulations
that
prohibited
any
type
of
net
fishery
in
this
particular
river
and
right
in
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
they
don't.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
but
we
want
--
our
argument
is
this.
let
more
fish
escape
so
we
have
fish.
don't
practice
conversation
on
the
indians,
conservation
for
the
commercial
interest
and
the
sports
interest
leaving
the
indians
out.
now,
the
federal
court
interpreting
this
very
point,
our
federal
points
out
in
the
west
coast,
they
applied
what
they
call
the
indispensable
test.
the
state
court
in
this
particular
case
applied
the
reasonable
necessary
test.
they
said
obviously,
it's
reasonable
and
necessary
that
by
that
time
the
fish
escapes
all
these
various
hazards
and
get
down
to
this
particular
point,
then
they
have
to
go
up
the
river.
in
the
umatilla
case,
maison
versus
umatilla
case
determined
by
the
ninth
circuit
said,
“before
you
start
regulating
this
treaty
indian
fishing
right,
and
there
they
interpret
a
very
similar
treaty
provision,
medicine
creek
treaty
was
one
of
the
first
of
the
series
of
treaties
involving
similar
type
of
people
and
similar
situation
and
what
they
did
in
that
case,
they
said:
“you
can't
start
on
the
other
end
and
say,
you're
not
going
to
leave
any
fish
for
the
indians.
you've
got
to
first
of
all
show
that
the
rules
and
regulations
you
are
applying
are
indispensable”.
in
other
words,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
umatilla
case,
which
makes
sense,
the
indians
had
bargained
and
this
was
principle
essence
of
that
treaty
that
we
would
get
an
abundant
supply
of
fish.
now,
the
fish
we
were
taking,
just
so
the
record
is
clear,
out
of
these
competing
group
of
individuals,
the
washington
commercial
group,
washington
sports
group
and
the
treaty
indian
groups,
out
of
that
catch,
the
total
catch,
we
get
3%
to
5%,
that's
all
we
were
taking.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
the
ultimate
argument
what
the
state
says
“will
happen.”
i
mean,
they
say
ultimately
this
will
happen
that
all
the
fish
will
be
caught.
there
had
been
escapements
all
along
throughout
this
period
of
time
because
of
the
peculiarity
of
the
river,
the
indians
can't
be
fishing
with
their
nets
and
these
nets
are
worked
on
the
outgoing
type
primarily.
there
is
some
escapement
and
the
point,
the
answer
to
that
question
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
they
do.
however,
of
course,
the
salmon,
being
peculiar
will
run
a
different
times
of
the
year
depending
on
the
species
or
the
races.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
they
use
these
gill
nets
and
they
do
catch
this
fish.
for
example,
the
testimony
of
dr.
lasator
at
the
trial
was
that
in
one
particular
year,
the
sports
fishermen
cut
18,500
steelhead
directly
behind
the
indian
fisheries
while
the
indians
took
1,500
steelhead.
in
answering
the
question,
it's
this:
i
think
that
what
we're
saying
we
don't
take
the
position
that
we
should
take
every
fish
that
comes.
the
indians
--
the
only
thing
the
indians
are
asking
is
that
the
treaty
be
given
its
interpretation
what
it
was
intended
to,
namely
that
we
got
a
right
to
catch
an
abundant
supply
of
fish
so
we
can
feed
and
supply
the
necessities
of
the
tribe.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
does.
the
indians
sold
commercially
in
1854.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into,
this
was
the
primary
--
the
indians
did
got
with
the
sale
of
fish;
they
supplied
the
settlers
with
fish
and
this
was
part
of
their
program.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
fish
was
it.
like
the
court
said
in
the
winans
case,
fish
was
so
important
to
these
people
and
that
was
important
as
they
--
brief.
mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
tribe
is
the
first
to
admit
that
we
shouldn't
take
it
all,
all
the
fish
that
go
up
the
river.
we're
not
attempting
to
say
that
we
don't
want
to
share
with
anyone.
this
has
never
been
the
indians'
position.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
would
say
that
what
should
happen
in
this
particular
case,
the
indians
should
be
permitted
to
set
up
their
regulations,
which
regulations
are,
of
course,
submitted
to
the
federal
government
and
that
at
that
particular
time
if
it
develops
that
the
indians
are
incapable
of
handling
the
problem,
congress
is
the
ultimate
where
this
situation
could
be
remedied.
congress
could
take
away
this
right,
but
the
umatilla,
the
one
maison
versus
umatilla,
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
used
the
term
“indispensable.”
what
that
case,
as
far
as
i
can
understand,
said,
“give
--
it's
indispensable
to
us
that
they
first
give
us
a
portion
of
the
share.”
i
fully
realized
it's
difficult
to
say
how
much
amounts
to
substantial
needs,
however,
in
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
could
conceivably.
this
is
true
but
again,
like
everything
else,
it
is
certainly
subject
to
certain
regulations
which
could
be
worked
out.
now
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
i
think
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty
is
that
these
people
made
a
living
and
that's
all
the
puyallups
are
now
entitled
to
even
the
nisqually,
it's
just
a
living;
and
you
have
350
members.
quite
obviously,
when
you
take
3%
to
5%
---
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
but
see,
what
we
did
when
we
took
over
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true.
but
you
see
what
society
did
or
more
or
less
what
we
did
to
the
indians,
we
said,
“now
you
adopt
our
western
civilization.”
i
mean,
our
schools
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
would
have
to
be
measured
by
reasonable
application,
probably
through
the
federal
government
and
the
state.
now,
when
you
take
a
look
for
example,
the
ideal
situation
is
for
example
the
canadians
have
an
agreement
with
the
same
fishery,
the
japanese,
the
russians
are
involved,
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
washington.
so
you
see
you
have
more
groups,
more
competing
groups
but
what
we
are
concerned
about,
we
don't
mind
the
indispensable
class
and
we
don't
mind
having
this
matter
go
to
federal
courts
where
the
federal
courts
say,
“well,
we
think
that
the
abundance
as
of
this
particular
point,
what
we
don't
want
to
have
is
being
in
a
position
where
the
state
of
washington
says
like
they're
entitled
to
enact
whatever
reasonable
legislation
is
necessary.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
they
prohibited
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true
but
the
problem
you've
got
is
that
the
hook
and
line
system
is
very
inefficient
when
the
fish
reach
this
particular
point
as
was
testified
to
by
the
state.
you
can't
possibly
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
that's
correct,
they're
going
upward.
mr.
arthur
knodel
not
on
the
other
side,
no.
these
fish
are
exposed
to
all
types
of
sports
fishery
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
after
we
get
to
be
a
certain
size.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
my
position
in
this
case
that
this
is
a
treaty
and
a
right
it's
federal
domain
and
i
think
only
the
federal
government
can
control.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
my
thinking
that
in
order
to
really
save
the
salmon,
it
is
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
take
a
very
active
part
in
helping
preserve
this
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
would
be
correct
to
an
extent.
however,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we've
been
asking,
the
thing
we
haven't
been
getting
is
an
adequate
number
of
fish
and
the
state
has
gradually
pecked
away
at
this
all
the
way
through
and
now
they
finally
got
it
down
to
the
point
where
they
said,
“we
reject
the
attitude
of
the
federal
courts
in
this
particular
area
in
applying
the
maison
versus
umatilla
case,
we're
going
to
reside
that
it
has
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary
and
the
reasonable
necessary
test
means,
as
the
lower
court
indicated,
we
put
it
that
--
the
court
put
in
this
effect
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
indian
fishery.
and
the
only
effective
way
to
catch
fish
is
by
the
methods
that
the
state,
by
its
regulations,
has
prohibited.
mr.
arthur
knodel
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
presented,
if
you
look
at
the
state's
brief,
you
will
notice
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
right,
that
they
restrained
them
from,
this
is
correct,
net
fishery
but
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
answer
is,
the
entire
--
the
injunction
totally
restrained
and
prohibited
the
use
of
any
nets
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
--
in
this
area.
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
any
rules
or
regulations,
but
it
totally
prohibited
the
use
of
any
nets
in
this
common
area
of
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
there
is
a
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
i
should,
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
what
i'm
talking
about
is
this,
when
you
catch
with
trawl
then
of
course
you'll
have
--
it's
very
inefficient
because
when
the
fish
starts
spawning
as
when
you
get
them,
you
catch
very
few.
and
to
catch
this
type
of
fish,
it
would
impossible
for
them
to
survive.
traditionally,
they
have
used
the
net
method
of
fishing.
i
see
my
--
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
that
particular
run
would
be
wiped
out
if
it
were
destroyed.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
the
only
problem
we
have
is
now
at
the
states
doing,
we're
taking
3%
and
5%
of
those
fish
now.
so
it
depends
where
you
call
a
spawning
fish
like
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
we're
talking
about
the
puyallup
fish
run,
3%
to
5%.
mr.
arthur
knodel
between
the
commercial
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
amount
we
take,
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
would
be
a
different
figure,
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
regulated.
they
vary
from
time
to
time.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct
but
their
nets
come
down
to
within
two
miles
of
the
puyallup
river.
mr.
arthur
knodel
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
let
me
state
that
i
can
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
having
an
adequate,
having
such
ruling
that
would
impose
upon
the
indians
the
duty
or
a
restriction
to
permit
a
proper
escapement
to
continue
this
run
of
salmon
because
no
group
wants
to
maintain
that
salmon
run
more
than
the
indians.
there
is
nothing
–
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
think
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
think
this
is
--
the
state's
testimony
repeatedly
showed
that
they
had
different
--
they
have
a
fish
biologist
showed
how
they
could
follow
this
fish
down
the
straits,
the
puyallup
run
or
any
other
run
and
then
select
from
that
run
as
they
proceed
down
into
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup.
let
me
point
to
the
court
and
it
probably
answers
this
question
little
more
indirectly.
this
is
the
map
of
the
puget
sound
area.
this
is
the
area
what
they
referred
to
as
commencement
bay.
commencement
bay
is
a
52
square
mile
area
and
your
fishing
in
approximately
commercial
fishing
ends
approximately
two
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river.
this
red
line
here
is
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
puyallup
indian
reservation
which
has
never
been
terminated
by
any
act
of
congress.
the
state
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
a
reservation
in
this
sense.
there
was
a
general
allotment
act.
in
that
general
allotment
act,
the
various
area
was
allotted
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
much
of
the
land
is
still
owned
by
the
indians
themselves
as
allotments
in
the
course
of
the
tribe
itself
owns
the
land
within.
but
anything,
this
was
an
article
ii
granted
to
the
indians
of
the
medicine
creek
treaty
as
their
exclusive
right.
they
reserved
this
in
which
they
can
live
peacefully
and
which
they
could
fish
from.
now,
the
fishing
right
is
a
communal
right
that
belongs
to
the
tribe
itself
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
have
never
been
--
the
fishing
rights
never
been
abandoned
by
them,
it
has
never
been
terminated
by
the
federal
government
just
like
federal
government
has
never
terminated
the
reservation.
and
there
is
a
termination
statute
which
specifically
provides
that
the
federal
government
can
terminate
a
reservation
or
can
terminate
a
tribe.
one
other
thing
i
wish
to
bring
out
is
these
fish,
when
they
proceed
up
to
puyallup
river,
the
fishing
actually,
the
puyallup
fishery
actually
ends
just
on
the
other
side
of
what
we
call
the
clarks
pink
bridge
with
approximately
three
miles
up
from
the
mouth
of
the
puyallup
river,
from
the
mouth
of
the
river.
these
fish
then
proceed
up
and
spawn.
there
is
no
spawning
in
this
area
at
all,
there's
none.
there's
no
spawning
inside
this
particular
area
here.
the
fish
proceed
up
to
other
crate.
the
state
showed
yesterday
a
rather
detailed,
it
is
here,
on
these
tributaries.
the
fish
will
travel,
like
i
say,
40
to
50
miles
up
and
then
they
will
go
to
these
various
branches:
the
white
river,
the
stock
river,
the
clark
river,
numerous
rivers
that
they
do.
but
one
thing
i
want
to
submit
to
the
court
is
this:
that
assuming
the
court
rules
that
the
state
does
have
the
right
through
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
to
totally
restrict
the
off
reservation
fishing
or
the
“in
common”
fishing,
this
is
not
going
to
resolve
the
problem.
because
of
this,
there
are
in
addition
to
the
puyallup
reservation,
there
are
17
other
reservations
in
the
state
and
as
it
turned
out,
the
fish,
the
greatest
number
of
fish
always
happen
to
be
going
into
the
reservation
area,
in
the
area
that
the
indians
have
their
fishing
exclusively
and
as
the
state
has
indicated,
“exclusively”.
they
concede,
everybody
agrees
here
that
on
a
reservation,
the
indians
have
the
right
to
fish
unrestricted.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
the
state
takes
the
position
that
the
puyallup
reservation
no
longer
exists,
their
position
is
that.
however,
they
do
recognize
for
example
the
quinault
reservation
and
other
reservations.
the
state
says
those
exist,
but
what
the
state
is
doing
is
gradually
taking
away
the
fishing
rights
of
the
indians.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
under
section
iii,
we
were
given
the
right
to
fish
in
common
with
other
citizens.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
it's
a
highly
industrialized
area.
mr.
arthur
knodel
there's
a
lot
of
different
people.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
law
practice
is
at
(inaudible)
within
that
area.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
sold
and
exchanged
and
this
is
the
theory
under
which
the
state
claims
the
reservation
does
not
exists
because
it
has
been
sold
or
because
they've
been
declared
citizens.
it's
our
contention
that
this
is
not
the
law
based
on
the
seymour
case,
which
this
court
ruled
was
the
only
congress
could
act.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
area
as
(voice
overlap)
afforded
in
the
medicine
creek
treaty,
1,280
acres.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
sir,
according
to
the
medicine
creek
treaty.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
this
is
approximately
correct.
i
believe
i
--
but
this
is
the
area
(voice
overlap).
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
a
3-mile
area
that
the
indians
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
it's
a
3-mile
area
that
the
indians
have
in
fishing
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
up
to
the
point
up
here,
it's
approximately
3
miles.
it's
the
area
the
indian
net
fishery
has
been
taking
place.
they
see
--
the
problem
i
think
is
this
that
some
place
down
the
line,
it's
our
contention
that
this
whole
field
of
indian
matter
arising
out
of
the
constitution,
the
constitution,
it's
our
position,
we're
dealing
with
treaty,
we're
dealing
with
indians,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
federal
domain
and
the
point
is
this.
if
this
supreme
court
makes
the
finding
that
the
indians
do
have
a
right,
that
they
do
have
this
treaty
right
as
we
believe
we
have,
and
then
places
upon
the
federal
government
the
position
that
they
assist
in
these
regulations
and
they
work
with
us.
now
the
interesting
thing
about
it,
this
has
been
such
a
conflict
on
this
point
that
the
federal
government
did
not
come
in
to
help
these
indians
until
at
the
state
supreme
court
level.
the
situation
got
to
the
point
where
they
felt
they
had
to
intervene.
but
here
we
are,
indians,
we're
sitting,
we
got
a
treaty,
we've
got
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
government,
a
promise
from
them
and
what
happens?
the
federal
government
isn't
fighting
with
the
state
or
they
don't
want
to
get
too
far
involved.
they
feel
the
law
is
too
vague
or
something.
the
state
in
turn
keeps
very
actively
going.
now
if
the
court
rules
that
the
state
can
prohibit
our
fishing
right,
our
treaty
right
by
regulations,
then
we
are
in
the
ridiculous
position
that
–
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
at
the
trial,
the
states'
testimony,
the
testimony
was
that
there
was
a
net
fishing
by
dr.
tiller.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
--
this
was
also
introduced
the
general
accounting,
the
breakdown.
in
1854,
congress
or
part
of
the
contribution
or
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
an
allowance
for
nets
in
seines.
it
actually
provided
for
that.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
true
it
doesn't
but
by
the
same
token,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
not
sure
they
would
not
let
them
fish
with
their
fish
wares
or
their
various
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
provided
they
use
the
same
equipment
that
the
states
says
they're
allowed
to
use.
the
only
thing
is
this.
the
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
thing
that
our
argument
or
complaint
is
this
that
when
this
treaty
was
entered
into,
this
fish
bargain
for
this
abandoned
fish
supply.
now
what's
happen
is
through
this
indirect
impact,
the
state
has
brought
about
a
tremendous
fishing
fleet,
a
tremendous
commercial
fishing
fleet
that
makes
the
fish
that
we
take
look
very,
very
small.
we
catch
a
very
small
portion
of
the
fish,
but
the
states'
old
procedure
of
fishing
has
increased.
they've
got
new
modern
boats.
they
got
all
this
modern
equipment.
they
have
nets
that,
as
testified
at
the
trial,
they
can
take
2500
fish.
we
have
purse
seines
at
one
time,
they
could
put
three
purse
seines
in
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
i
would
say
that.
i
would
say
we're
the
smallest.
mr.
arthur
knodel
first,
you
have
many
commercial
fishermen
fishing
but
this
would
be
relatively
small,
yes.
because
by
the
time
you
stop
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i
would
say
there
are
smaller.
it
depends
on
the
nets
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
what?
mr.
arthur
knodel
well
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
if
you
compare
to
the
huge
fleets
that
go
out,
some
of
these
boats
are
fantastic,
the
amount
of
fish
they
take.
mr.
arthur
knodel
at
the
trial,
it
was
shown
that
70
different
families
fish
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
seventy
different
families
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
fish
commercially
in
this
usual
and
accustomed
ground.
now
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
talking
about
the
puyallups,
yes.
now,
the
one
thing
it
affects
all
of
them
but
this
is
something
everybody
losses
sight
of.
is
this
fishing
by
the
puyallups
has
been
under
considerable
harassment,
after
the
satiacum
case
came
down
in
1953,
up
to
that
point,
the
state
was
continuously
arresting
and
taking
indians.
satiacum
was
arrested
in
1953.
the
state
of
washington,
by
a
split
decision,
determined
that
satiacum
was
released
and
then
the
indians
proceeded
to
fish
more.
this
is
true.
they
had
fished
prior
to
that
time
but
it
was
a
continuous
harassment
by
the
state.
then
what
happened
was,
since
then,
as
the
records
will
show,
the
state
has
been
openly
watching
and
doing
everything
possible,
gathering
it's
facts,
it's
data
to
come
back
in
and
select
another
time
and
another
day
to
come
back
and
move
in.
this
has
made
the
fishing
such
a
difficult
position
for
these
indian
people
that
it's
been
difficult
for
them
to
possibly
work
on
it.
we've
also
had
the
problem
that
the
federal
government
has
been
rather
weak
in
this
particular
field
because
they
haven't
really
known
exactly
what
they
should
be
doing,
but
i
think
once
the
court
determines
that
this
is
a
right,
that
the
right
is
there
and
it's
certainly
our
contention
that
this
is
the
federal
area
and
this
will
be
taken
cared
of
in
the
state
of
washing
--
oregon
will
go
ahead
and
resolve
this
problem.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no.
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
i'm
not
asking
that
they
overrule
that
because
the
state
supreme
court
made
a
finding
there
was
tribe,
were
organized
and
recognized
by
the
federal
government
as
there's
350
members
of
the
puyallup
indian
tribe?
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
don't
all
live
at
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
within
the
area?
mr.
arthur
knodel
now
i
would
be
guessing.
i
would
say
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
oh!
yes,
definitely.
i
would
say
there
would
be
probably
a
125
to
150.
they're
quite
a
few.
yes,
about
a
125.
mr.
arthur
knodel
as
i
indicated
that
70
participate.
it's
true,
it's
definitely
true
that
three
of
them
have
been
doing
the
major
fishing.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
don't
know
whether
i
understand
the
question
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
it
is
tribal
position
that
this
is
a
communal
right.
the
on
reservation
fishing,
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing,
this
is
subject
to
control
by
the
tribe.
and
if
the
tribe
determines
to
cut
down
or
whatever
the
tribe
determines
to
do,
the
tribe
has
that
right
because
it
is
a
tribal
right.
it
doesn't
belong
to
any
individual.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
not.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
are
interested
because
they
have
certain
tribal
people
that
are
fishing,
that
are
interested
in
this
particular
fishing
right
and
these
are
part
of
the
tribe
and
if
these
men
are
restrained
or
prohibited
from
fishing,
then
of
course,
we
have
the
problem
that
the
other
members
loss
their
right
too.
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
again,
like
i
say
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
tribe
has
its
regulations.
yes,
there
are
regulations
or
that
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
as
to
the
fishing,
yes.
mr.
arthur
knodel
there's
certain
length
of
nets
and
so
various
different
items.
now,
we've
had
one
problem
with
that
which
i
--
is
it
so
much
alright
for
me
to
continue?
mr.
arthur
knodel
the
problem
we've
had
is
this.
the
puyallup
tribe
prepared
these
regulations,
the
governing
tribal
counsel.
these
regulations
were
submitted
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
at
that
time
they
were
submitted
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
which
was
a
good
member
years
ago,
a
problem
developed
because
of
all
the
uncertainty
in
this
particular
field.
as
to
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
and
the
state's
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
regulate,
federal
government
had
no
right
in
this
area,
then
as
a
result,
no
action
was
taken.
now,
anything
the
tribe
does,
we
have
to
do
through
because
we
are
more
or
less
created
or
treaty
as
with
the
united
states
government.
we've
got
to
do
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
what's
happened,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
federal
government
has
just
been
slow
to
get
around
to
this
problem
if
they
just
haven't
caught
up,
i
guess.
now,
there's
starting
to
and
you
will
notice
how
they
came
in
on
passing
these
regulations,
these
other
regulations
they
submitted
and
also
they
entered
this
case
when
we
got
to
the
state
supreme
court.
so,
what
i'm
saying,
now
that
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
position
or
this
court
clears
the
air
and
says,
“well,
this
is
a
treaty
right
and
if
the
indians
do
have
a
right
to
fish,
this
is
a
federal
government
area.
you're
going
to
have
the
federal
government
come
into
this
and
assist
these
tribes
in
proper
and
decent
conservation.
you're
going
to
have
on
the
reservations
anyhow
so
this
is
just
as
good
a
place
to
start
as
any”.
mr.
arthur
knodel
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
knodel
i'm
sorry,
i
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
i
claim
that
the
federal
government
has
recognized
these
people
as
a
tribe
since
1854.
they've
always
had
a
form
of
government,
the
federal
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
a
consul,
who
is
a
very
active
consul.
they
are
present
in
the
court
now.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
an
active
consul,
five
consul
men.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
no
police
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
part
of
the
area
is
part
of
the
city
of
tacoma.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
of
course,
our
taking
is
that
this
is
a
property
right
as
much
as
similar
to
the
land.
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
in
1929,
the
puyallups
recurred
a
tribal
roll
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
--
and
in
order
to
prepare,
hearings
were
had
to
bring
the
various
people
up
to,
you
know,
to
determine
whether
they
were
members
of
the
tribe
and
after
they
had
arrived
at
that
decision,
this
roll
was
completed
and
in
the
by-laws
it
states
that
no
one
–
“that
in
order
to
be
a
member
of
the
tribe,
you
would
have
to
be
born
within
radius
of
20
miles
from
the
indian
hospital”,
which
is
right
in
the
heart
of
the,
right
next
[inaudible]
mr.
arthur
knodel
this
is
correct.
that
roll
was
accepted
and
recognized
the
tribe.
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
establish
who
is
a
member
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
point
is,
the
matter
that
it
didn't
get
into
the
brief
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
ruled
there
was
a
tribe.
so
the
matters
that
came
up
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
what
right
does
the
state
of
washington
have
to
regulate
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
grounds
and
the
fishing
rights
of
the
puyallup
indians.
this
is
the
matter
before
the
court
so
i
didn't
submit
anything
on
this
particular
matter.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
individually,
the
tribe
itself
as
a
tribe,
i
mean,
they
exercise
it
as
individuals,
the
members
of
that
tribe
themselves.
any
member
of
that
tribe
wants
to
exercise
this
fishing
right
can
go
ahead
and
do
it.
now,
mr.
satiacum
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
no,
they
haven't.
they
haven't.
mr.
arthur
knodel
they
have
that
right.
this
is
true,
but
again,
like
i
say,
we
take
this
position
that
this
is
kind
of
a
property
right
that
stays
like
a
piece
of
real
estate
--
mr.
arthur
knodel
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
the
united
states
government
has
recognized
them
as
a
tribe
and
part
of
the
treaty.
mr.
arthur
knodel
and
part
of
the
treaty
was
that
they
did
have
this
fishing
right.
this
was
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
thank
you
sir.
