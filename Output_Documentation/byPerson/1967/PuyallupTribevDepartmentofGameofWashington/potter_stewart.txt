justice

stewart
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
anything
of
which
we
might
take
judicial
notice
as
to
first,
how
many
fish
were
being
taken
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
in
1854
by
the
indians;
second,
by
what
means
were
they
being
taken
and
third,
relating
back
to
first;
if
not
how
many,
then
what
percentage
or
proportion
of
the
whole?
justice
potter
stewart
in
1954?
justice
potter
stewart
my
thought
is
--
the
thought
behind
my
questions
was
that
i
don't
know
that
anybody
is
taking
that
position
that
the
records
to
the
1854
treaty
might
be
referable
in
the
meats
and
bounds
of
either
the
proportion
of
the
fish
that
were
being
taken
then
or
the
number
of
fish
that
were
being
taken
then
or
the
means
that
were
used
to
be
taken
at
that
time,
the
time
of
the
treaty,
and
i
wondered
if
we
have
any
data
on
those
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
showing
of
how
many
fish
roughly
taken
at
the
time
of
the
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
hundred
percent
of
the
fish
that
were
taken
they
were
being
taken
by
the
indians
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
question,
i
mean,
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
suppose
one
approach
to
this
question
could
be
that
the
indians
were
given
the
right
under
the
1854
treaty
to
take
the
quantity
of
fish
they
were
then
taking
by
the
methods
that
they
were
then
using.
i
don't
know
that
anybody
has
approached
it
that
way
and
perhaps,
i
that
would
be
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
you
could
do
that,
i
suppose,
without
reference
to
the
treaty.
you
could
do
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
state
was
discriminating
against
an
unidentifiable
group
of
people,
either
ethnic
or
otherwise,
that's
an
ordinary
equal
protection
clause
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
--
meaning
of
a
treaty,
i'm
having
a
send
of
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think,
mr.
martin,
implicit
in
your
position,
i
might
not
right,
is
the
concession
that
if
the
state
could
show
that
the
prohibition
of
any
fishing
by
these
indians
was
necessary
for
the
legitimate
purposes
of
conservation
then
they
could
prohibit
the
indians
from
doing
so?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
the
premise?
justice
potter
stewart
their
fair
share
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
answer
to
the
question,
the
basic
question
of
the
chief
justice
as
to
what
your
position
is
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
provision
of
the
treaty,
i
want
to
be
sure
you
--
i
understood
your
answer.
you
said
the
--
you
thought
it
simply
guaranteed
that
the
indians
would
not
be
discriminated
against?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
treaty
gives
them
no
more
than
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
now
gives
the,
and
i
realize
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
after
this
treaty?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
on
the
reservation,
they
might
use
means
which
off
the
reservation
would
be
illegal.
justice

is
there
anything
in

anything

well,
a
