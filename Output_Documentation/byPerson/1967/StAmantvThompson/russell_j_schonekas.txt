mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
this
case
unlike
the
two
prior
ones
i
don't
think
is
nearly
is
complicated
presents
very
simple
issues
were
obtained.
i
say
they're
simple
because
they
are
singular
and
simple
it's
just
a
question
in
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
absolutely
refused
to
follow
the
instructions
and
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court
and
that
by
some
in
substance
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
phil
st.
amant
was
a
qualified
candidate
for
the
senate
--
for
the
state
of
louisiana
and
during
his
campaign
he
made
certain
statements
against
one
herman
a.
thompson
who
was
then
a
police
sheriff's
captain
for
one
of
the
parishes,
that
is
the
parish
of
east
baton
rouge
unlike
--
most
every
other
state
we
have
parishes
as
apposed
to
counties.
we're
different
again
in
that
respect.
we're
always
different.
now,
we
again
this
particular
parish
did
not
have
police
officers,
they
have
what
they
call
a
sheriff's
force.
a
sheriff
with
other
deputies
who
will
work
directly
under
him
and
his
official
functions
as
a
sheriff.
this
plaintiff
--
respondent
here,
herman
a.
thompson
was
a
deputy
sheriff
enjoined
the
position
of
captain.
mr.
st.
amant
in
his
campaign
and
over
a
--
with
a
radio
address
which
was
also
distributed
claimed
that
mr.
thompson
had
been
received
from
the
other
party
to
--
change
of
hands
of
money
between
themselves
and
another
individual
whom
he
claimed
was
very
nefarious
character,
mr.
ed
partin
who
was
a
union
official
with
quite
a
background
and
who
they
claimed
were
very
close
friends
and
mr.
partin
had
been
there
and
mr.
thompson
had
been
to
mr.
partin's
office
and
there
had
been
a
change
of
money.
immediately
thereafter,
mr.
thompson,
captain
thompson
instituted
a
liable
and
slander
sued
in
the
state
court
of
louisiana
under
what
we
referred
to
as
article
2315,
that
is
the
tort
law
for
the
state
of
louisiana
which
says
that
every
action
of
man
that
causes
damage
to
another
he,
by
whose
fault
this
shall
be
the
case,
must
repair
to
damage.
in
this
damage
of
liable
sued
against
him,
the
defense
was
raised,
number
one,
that
there
was
--
it
was
to
--
not
malice,
it
was
not
--
was
not
liable,
was
not
slander
etcetera
and
further
in
the
alternative
that
if
it
were
that
these
statements
were
true
that
money
had
exchanged
stand.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
lower
court,
a
judgment
was
rendered
against
mr.
st.
amant
alleging
that
the
statements
were
liable
and
slanderous
implying
malice
to
him
by
virtue
of
these
actions
that
he
have
taken.
this
court
had
handed
down
the
time-sullivan
--
times
case
and
based
on
that
decision
waiving
it
a
new
trial
was
applied
for
the
district
level,
the
judge
should
consider
the
decision
of
the
times
case
and
ruled
that
it
was
not
applicable
here.
he
did
however
hold
that
captains
--
thompson
was
a
public
official
as
had
been
defined
in
the
various
cases
prior
that
time
but
not
under
the
federal
theory.
he
said
that
under
the
laws
of
louisiana,
captain
thompson
was
a
public
official
and
that
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
for
the
captain
level.
but
on
the
rehearing,
we
consider
the
times
case,
he
refused
to
apply
it.
the
case
then
went
to
our
court
of
appeals,
the
first
circuit
at
which
time
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
applied
the
doctrine
and
said
that
the
aegis
of
the
times
case
did
apply,
there
was
no
malice,
it
could
not
be
imputed,
they
overruled
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
dismissed
plaintiff
suit.
rich
will
apply
to
it
for
the
normal
rehearing
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
the
case
was
again
argued
and
the
court
held
that
while
it
did
apply
again
as
to
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
thompson
was
a
public
official
under
the
times
case.
still
that
he
had
not
done
taking
certain
action
that
were
required,
he
to
--
they
thought
to
wipe
away
this
threat
of
malice
and
therefore
we
say
implied
malice
again
was
applied
which
cannot
be
done
under
the
decisions
that
your
honors
have
recently
written
along
that
line
particularly
like
with
garrison,
the
butts
case,
the
walker
case
and
the
sullivan
case.
but
nevertheless
they
did
in
a
4:3
opinion
with
the
strong
dissent
by
justice
mckellop
(ph),
the
--
we
applied
for
the
rehearing
subsequently
in
writ
which
we
are
granted
here.
the
only
problem,
the
only
issues
that
are
raised
that
i
see
that
came
here
is
number
one,
was
this
deputy
sheriff
a
public
official.
but
your
honors
we're
very
careful
to
point
out
in
the
times
case,
you
didn't
say
definitely
how
far
down
the
line
you
would
go
to
determine
when
is
a
man
a
public
official
or
a
public
person
as
the
other
line
of
cases
differentiate
from
public
official.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
that
is
the
holding
but
is
a
manner
in
which
this
holding
is
applied.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
to
a
judge.
all
of
our
jury
cases
are
all
subject
to
review
on
laws
as
well
as
facts
of
precious
view
are
tried
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir
and
his
reasons
for
judgment,
i
am
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
so,
on
page
25
of
the
writ,
it
would
be
in
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir,
it's
--
i'm
trying
to
give
it
to
you
now.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
he
did
say
it
in
there.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
(inaudible)
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
141,
i
believe
those
are
the
initial
reasons
sir
yet
they're
not
the
ones
considering
the
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
in
the
reason
it
starts
at
154,
correct
sir.
that's
when
he's
talking
about
--
he
holds
and
to
be
a
public
official
under
our
law
which
was
a
misapplication
but
it
doesn't
matter
insofar
as
that
is
concern
they
won
57.
he
goes
to
the
times,
new
york
times-sullivan
case
and
he
--
his
position
there
was
that
he
didn't
bother
to
properly
investigate.
this
is
what
almost
the
same
thing
that
the
supreme
--
our
supreme
court
held
that
he's
inactivity,
it
is
the
basis
for
his
malice's
that
i've
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir,
well
that
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
we
say
it's
--
it
satisfies
it
but
what
he
says
when
he
comes
down
to
the
application
of
the
new
york
times
he
says
that
the
--
it
does
apply
but
yet
that
we
find
there
is
actual
malice
in
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
or
whether
this
was
true
or
not
that
st.
amant
recklessly
disregard
what
was
truth.
we
say
he
substitutes
ignorance
of
falsity
for
ignorance
of
knowledge.
there's
no
parity
there.
he
says,
yes
new
york
times
applied
but
st.
amant
didn't
go
check
this
out.
he
didn't
go
check
this
out
for
it
to
be
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that's
correct
sir.
in
other
words,
if
they
have
--
the
very
things
that
they're
calling
us
to
say
that
is
actual
malice
are
the
very
things
that
you
all
have
rejected
in
other
decisions,
that
is
the
investigatory
failures.
the
--
in
other
words,
st.
amant
worst
could've
been
guilty
of
negligence
of
not
going
further
in
doing
something
more
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
and
known
to
him
and
that
would
be
knowledge
of
falsity
and
he
would
be
liable,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no,
he'd
have
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
then,
possibly
he
could
not
sit
on
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
he
had,
he
knew
the
man.
he
knew
the
man,
man's
name
was
alvin.
he
knew
the
man
to
be
a
former
official,
an
officer
of
this
union
who
was
providing
him
with
this
information
under
a
notarial
affidavit.
this
was
not
somebody
just
off
the
street
that
furnished
him
with
his
knowledge
and
he
went
on
television.
this
was
a
former
official
of
this
very
union.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
it
would
have
been
--
with
partin
with
his
notorious
background
that
he
knew
about
he
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
pardon.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
at
that
time
or
not
but
let's
take
that
this
--
i
say
it
parallels
the
times
case
entirely.
you
suggest
to
me
that
because
he
was
a
union
official
because
of
partin's
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
other
people
than
the
people
that
were
being
sued
at
that
--
they
were
also
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
forget
the
exact
people
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
in
other
words,
at
the
time
new
york
times
accepted
and
ad.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
from
other
people
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
right.
but
the
court,
this
court
also
said
in
that
decision
that
despite
the
fact
that
they
knew
them
that
they
would've
only
check
their
files
when
they're
reporting
system
they
would've
seen
that
this
was
not
true.
there
was
no
question
it
was
not
true
in
the
new
york
times
case.
that
is
part
of
it,
it
was
not
true
and
this
court
said
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
new
york
times
people
merely
had
to
check
their
own
reporting
system
that
this
was
a
breakdown
of
an
investigatory
failure.
here,
what
you
would
say
is
its
st.
amant,
he
didn't
go
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
then
as
this
court
said
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
that
brings
the
suit
to
show
that
they
acted
with
malice
not
even
hatred.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
say
that
falls
within
the
rules
that's
set
out
and
clearly
been
said
by
this
court
and
--
these
cases,
the
butts
case,
the
walker
case
and
there
is
that
it
is
not
just
that
is
possibly
negligence
but
negligence
does
not
constitute
malice.
this
is
what
your
honors
have
said
time
and
again.
justice
black
has
said
that
going
further
down
the
line
each
time.
you
must
practically
come
in
and
say
under
the
times-sullivan
case,
i
hate
you,
i'm
going
to
say
it,
i'm
going
to
say
it
to
hurt
you
and
that's
the
only
way
it's
malice.
but
all
these
other
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
if
i
say
that
i'm
doing
it
strictly
to
hurt
you,
yes
sir
and
i'm
only
doing
it
because
i
want
to
hurt
you.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
oh,
that's
the
only
exception
to
the
rule.
i'm
assuming
it
isn't
the
truth
that
we
get
to
that.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
if
it's
a
truth,
he
can
say
it.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
that's
not
what's
been
said
in
the
prior
case
by
this
court
but
would
be
part
of
it
is
here
is
that
we've
maintained
as
we
did
in
the
other
courts
that
it
was
true.
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
it.
clearly
the
man
says,
"yes
with
the
main
defense
to
the
fact
that
the
money
didn't
change
hands
was
that
partin
said
he
always
receive
checks,
he
haven't
took
cash."
but
the
secretary
who
also
testified
in
the
case
said
that
she
opened
up
the
envelop
that
we've
been
delivered
by
parton
to
him
and
it
contained
cash.
this
is
completely
contradictory
and
does
support
the
affidavit
of
alvin
that
it
was
cash
changing
hands
between
partin
and
his
deputy
sheriff
down
there.
and
partin
said
unequivocally
he
only
took
checks.
but
the
lower
court
says
despite
the
fact
that
we
don't
have
the
burden,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
prove
the
malice,
the
lower
court
said,
"we
should've
produced
partin.
we
should've
produced
the
other
secretary
to
prove
all
of
these
things."
we
don't
have
to
produce
all
that
but
we
did
produce
the
secretary
to
these
people
who
showed
that
despite
his
accusations
that
there
was
cash.
now,
i
object,
if
i
may,
the
great
weight
that
was
placed
on
it
by
the
supreme
court
justice
of
our
state
was
that
this
lady's
testimony
wasn't
brought
about
until
after
the
suit
was
filed.
that's
true
maybe
st.
amant
didn't
know
about
it
who
was
the
plaintiff
or
relate
to
--
i
mean,
defendant
relater
here
but
the
man
furnishing
him
that
affidavit
well
knew
of
it
at
the
time.
and
that's
how
it
was
brought
about.
so
we
say
that
we
stand
clearly
that
under
the
test
that
you've
established
he
is
a
public
official.
he
only
acts
at
some
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that's
the
entire
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
i
just
said
simple
and
correct,
so
i
said
it's
a
simple
proposition
here.
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
it.
now,
in
the
respondent's
brief
he
argues
the
point
that
it
wasn't
technically
pleaded
in
the
original
plea.
that
was
not
a
party
to
him,
that's
not
an
excuse
for
the
case.
but
it
was
raised
in
a
lower
court.
it
was
raised
in
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no,
no.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
they
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that
simply
the
entire
case.
if
there'd
no
need
for
any
further
arguments
your
honor
state.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
don't
see
any
need
for
rebuttal.
i
think,
justice
brennan
(inaudible)
one
simple
problem,
it's
been
decided
previously
just
applying
to
this
case.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
this
case
unlike
the
two
prior
ones
i
don't
think
is
nearly
is
complicated
presents
very
simple
issues
were
obtained.
i
say
they're
simple
because
they
are
singular
and
simple
it's
just
a
question
in
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
absolutely
refused
to
follow
the
instructions
and
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court
and
that
by
some
in
substance
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
phil
st.
amant
was
a
qualified
candidate
for
the
senate
--
for
the
state
of
louisiana
and
during
his
campaign
he
made
certain
statements
against
one
herman
a.
thompson
who
was
then
a
police
sheriff's
captain
for
one
of
the
parishes,
that
is
the
parish
of
east
baton
rouge
unlike
--
most
every
other
state
we
have
parishes
as
apposed
to
counties.
we're
different
again
in
that
respect.
we're
always
different.
now,
we
again
this
particular
parish
did
not
have
police
officers,
they
have
what
they

a

with
other
deputies
who
will
work
directly
under
him
and
his
official
functions
as
a
sheriff.
this
plaintiff
--
respondent
here,
herman
a.
thompson
was
a
deputy
sheriff
enjoined
the
position
of
captain.
mr.
st.
amant
in
his
campaign
and
over
a
--
with
a
radio
address
which
was
also
distributed
claimed
that
mr.
thompson
had
been
received
from
the
other
party
to
--
change
of
hands
of
money
between
themselves
and
another
individual
whom
he
claimed
was
very
nefarious
character,
mr.
ed
partin
who
was
a
union
official
with
quite
a
background
and
who
they
claimed
were
very
close
friends
and
mr.
partin
had
been
there
and
mr.
thompson
had
been
to
mr.
partin's
office
and
there
had
been
a
change
of
money.
immediately
thereafter,
mr.
thompson,
captain
thompson
instituted
a
liable
and
slander
sued
in
the
state
court
of
louisiana
under
what
we
referred
to
as
article
2315,
that
is
the
tort
law
for
the
state
of
louisiana
which
says
that
every
action
of
man
that
causes
damage
to
another
he,
by
whose
fault
this
shall
be
the
case,
must
repair
to
damage.
in
this
damage
of
liable
sued
against
him,
the
defense
was
raised,
number
one,
that
there
was
--
it
was
to
--
not
malice,
it
was
not
--
was
not
liable,
was
not
slander
etcetera
and
further
in
the
alternative
that
if
it
were
that
these
statements
were
true
that
money
had
exchanged
stand.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
lower
court,
a
judgment
was
rendered
against
mr.
st.
amant
alleging
that
the
statements
were
liable
and
slanderous
implying
malice
to
him
by
virtue
of
these
actions
that
he
have
taken.
this
court
had
handed
down
the
time-sullivan
--
times
case
and
based
on
that
decision
waiving
it
a
new
trial
was
applied
for
the
district
level,
the
judge
should
consider
the
decision
of
the
times
case
and
ruled
that
it
was
not
applicable
here.
he
did
however
hold
that
captains
--
thompson
was
a
public
official
as
had
been
defined
in
the
various
cases
prior
that
time
but
not
under
the
federal
theory.
he
said
that
under
the
laws
of
louisiana,
captain
thompson
was
a
public
official
and
that
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
for
the
captain
level.
but
on
the
rehearing,
we
consider
the
times
case,
he
refused
to
apply
it.
the
case
then
went
to
our
court
of
appeals,
the
first
circuit
at
which
time
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
applied
the
doctrine
and
said
that
the
aegis
of
the
times
case
did
apply,
there
was
no
malice,
it
could
not
be
imputed,
they
overruled
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
dismissed
plaintiff
suit.
rich
will
apply
to
it
for
the
normal
rehearing
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
the
case
was
again
argued
and
the
court
held
that
while
it
did
apply
again
as
to
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
thompson
was
a
public
official
under
the
times
case.
still
that
he
had
not
done
taking
certain
action
that
were
required,
he
to
--
they
thought
to
wipe
away
this
threat
of
malice
and
therefore
we
say
implied
malice
again
was
applied
which
cannot
be
done
under
the
decisions
that
your
honors
have
recently
written
along
that
line
particularly
like
with
garrison,
the
butts
case,
the
walker
case
and
the
sullivan
case.
but
nevertheless
they
did
in
a
4:3
opinion
with
the
strong
dissent
by
justice
mckellop
(ph),
the
--
we
applied
for
the
rehearing
subsequently
in
writ
which
we
are
granted
here.
the
only
problem,
the
only
issues
that
are
raised
that
i
see
that
came
here
is
number
one,
was
this
deputy
sheriff
a
public
official.
but
your
honors
we're
very
careful
to
point
out
in
the
times
case,
you
didn't
say
definitely
how
far
down
the
line
you
would
go
to
determine
when
is
a
man
a
public
official
or
a
public
person
as
the
other
line
of
cases
differentiate
from
public
official.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
that
is
the
holding
but
is
a
manner
in
which
this
holding
is
applied.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
to
a
judge.
all
of
our
jury
cases
are
all
subject
to
review
on
laws
as
well
as
facts
of
precious
view
are
tried
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir
and
his
reasons
for
judgment,
i
am
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
so,
on
page
25
of
the
writ,
it
would
be
in
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir,
it's
--
i'm
trying
to
give
it
to
you
now.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
he
did
say
it
in
there.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
(inaudible)
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
141,
i
believe
those
are
the
initial
reasons
sir
yet
they're
not
the
ones
considering
the
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
in
the
reason
it
starts
at
154,
correct
sir.
that's
when
he's
talking
about
--
he
holds
and
to
be
a
public
official
under
our
law
which
was
a
misapplication
but
it
doesn't
matter
insofar
as
that
is
concern
they
won
57.
he
goes
to
the
times,
new
york
times-sullivan
case
and
he
--
his
position
there
was
that
he
didn't
bother
to
properly
investigate.
this
is
what
almost
the
same
thing
that
the
supreme
--
our
supreme
court
held
that
he's
inactivity,
it
is
the
basis
for
his
malice's
that
i've
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir,
well
that
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
we
say
it's
--
it
satisfies
it
but
what
he
says
when
he
comes
down
to
the
application
of
the
new
york
times
he
says
that
the
--
it
does
apply
but
yet
that
we
find
there
is
actual
malice
in
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
or
whether
this
was
true
or
not
that
st.
amant
recklessly
disregard
what
was
truth.
we
say
he
substitutes
ignorance
of
falsity
for
ignorance
of
knowledge.
there's
no
parity
there.
he
says,
yes
new
york
times
applied
but
st.
amant
didn't
go
check
this
out.
he
didn't
go
check
this
out
for
it
to
be
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that's
correct
sir.
in
other
words,
if
they
have
--
the
very
things
that
they're
calling
us
to
say
that
is
actual
malice
are
the
very
things
that
you
all
have
rejected
in
other
decisions,
that
is
the
investigatory
failures.
the
--
in
other
words,
st.
amant
worst
could've
been
guilty
of
negligence
of
not
going
further
in
doing
something
more
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
and
known
to
him
and
that
would
be
knowledge
of
falsity
and
he
would
be
liable,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no,
he'd
have
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
then,
possibly
he
could
not
sit
on
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir,
he
had,
he
knew
the
man.
he
knew
the
man,
man's
name
was
alvin.
he
knew
the
man
to
be
a
former
official,
an
officer
of
this
union
who
was
providing
him
with
this
information
under
a
notarial
affidavit.
this
was
not
somebody
just
off
the
street
that
furnished
him
with
his
knowledge
and
he
went
on
television.
this
was
a
former
official
of
this
very
union.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
it
would
have
been
--
with
partin
with
his
notorious
background
that
he
knew
about
he
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
pardon.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
at
that
time
or
not
but
let's
take
that
this
--
i
say
it
parallels
the
times
case
entirely.
you
suggest
to
me
that
because
he
was
a
union
official
because
of
partin's
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
other
people
than
the
people
that
were
being
sued
at
that
--
they
were
also
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
forget
the
exact
people
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
in
other
words,
at
the
time
new
york
times
accepted
and
ad.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
from
other
people
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
right.
but
the
court,
this
court
also
said
in
that
decision
that
despite
the
fact
that
they
knew
them
that
they
would've
only
check
their
files
when
they're
reporting
system
they
would've
seen
that
this
was
not
true.
there
was
no
question
it
was
not
true
in
the
new
york
times
case.
that
is
part
of
it,
it
was
not
true
and
this
court
said
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
new
york
times
people
merely
had
to
check
their
own
reporting
system
that
this
was
a
breakdown
of
an
investigatory
failure.
here,
what
you
would
say
is
its
st.
amant,
he
didn't
go
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
think
then
as
this
court
said
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
that
brings
the
suit
to
show
that
they
acted
with
malice
not
even
hatred.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
say
that
falls
within
the
rules
that's
set
out
and
clearly
been
said
by
this
court
and
--
these
cases,
the
butts
case,
the
walker
case
and
there
is
that
it
is
not
just
that
is
possibly
negligence
but
negligence
does
not
constitute
malice.
this
is
what
your
honors
have
said
time
and
again.
justice
black
has
said
that
going
further
down
the
line
each
time.
you
must
practically
come
in
and
say
under
the
times-sullivan
case,
i
hate
you,
i'm
going
to
say
it,
i'm
going
to
say
it
to
hurt
you
and
that's
the
only
way
it's
malice.
but
all
these
other
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
if
i
say
that
i'm
doing
it
strictly
to
hurt
you,
yes
sir
and
i'm
only
doing
it
because
i
want
to
hurt
you.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
oh,
that's
the
only
exception
to
the
rule.
i'm
assuming
it
isn't
the
truth
that
we
get
to
that.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
if
it's
a
truth,
he
can
say
it.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
that's
not
what's
been
said
in
the
prior
case
by
this
court
but
would
be
part
of
it
is
here
is
that
we've
maintained
as
we
did
in
the
other
courts
that
it
was
true.
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
it.
clearly
the
man
says,
"yes
with
the
main
defense
to
the
fact
that
the
money
didn't
change
hands
was
that
partin
said
he
always
receive
checks,
he
haven't
took
cash."
but
the
secretary
who
also
testified
in
the
case
said
that
she
opened
up
the
envelop
that
we've
been
delivered
by
parton
to
him
and
it
contained
cash.
this
is
completely
contradictory
and
does
support
the
affidavit
of
alvin
that
it
was
cash
changing
hands
between
partin
and
his
deputy
sheriff
down
there.
and
partin
said
unequivocally
he
only
took
checks.
but
the
lower
court
says
despite
the
fact
that
we
don't
have
the
burden,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
prove
the
malice,
the
lower
court
said,
"we
should've
produced
partin.
we
should've
produced
the
other
secretary
to
prove
all
of
these
things."
we
don't
have
to
produce
all
that
but
we
did
produce
the
secretary
to
these
people
who
showed
that
despite
his
accusations
that
there
was
cash.
now,
i
object,
if
i
may,
the
great
weight
that
was
placed
on
it
by
the
supreme
court
justice
of
our
state
was
that
this
lady's
testimony
wasn't
brought
about
until
after
the
suit
was
filed.
that's
true
maybe
st.
amant
didn't
know
about
it
who
was
the
plaintiff
or
relate
to
--
i
mean,
defendant
relater
here
but
the
man
furnishing
him
that
affidavit
well
knew
of
it
at
the
time.
and
that's
how
it
was
brought
about.
so
we
say
that
we
stand
clearly
that
under
the
test
that
you've
established
he
is
a
public
official.
he
only
acts
at
some
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that's
the
entire
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no
sir.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
yes
sir.
i
just
said
simple
and
correct,
so
i
said
it's
a
simple
proposition
here.
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
it.
now,
in
the
respondent's
brief
he
argues
the
point
that
it
wasn't
technically
pleaded
in
the
original
plea.
that
was
not
a
party
to
him,
that's
not
an
excuse
for
the
case.
but
it
was
raised
in
a
lower
court.
it
was
raised
in
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
no,
no.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
they
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that
--
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
that
simply
the
entire
case.
if
there'd
no
need
for
any
further
arguments
your
honor
state.
mr.
russell
j.
schonekas
i
don't
see
any
need
for
rebuttal.
i
think,
justice
brennan
(inaudible)
one
simple
problem,
it's
been
decided
previously
just
applying
to
this
case.
