justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask?
i
guess
perhaps
i
don't
read
your
supreme
court
opinion
correctly,
i
thought
the
holding
here
was
that
yes
he's
a
public
official
within
the
new
york
times
rule
and
therefore
was
a
burden
to
show
malice
in
the
sense
of
knowing
forcefully
or
reckless
disregard
that
while
there
was
no
showing
of
knowing
falsely
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
reckless
disregard,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
tell
me
was
this
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
the
--
accepting
the
supreme
court's
holding
that
this
is
a
new
york
times
case,
is
there
anything
at
all
to
indicate
whether
or
not
in
reaching
the
judgment
on
what
basis
the
trial
judge
raised
it,
did
he
set
--
did
he
hold
anywhere
that
he
--
on
your
motion
after
times
was
decided,
i
reconsidered
this,
i
apply
the
new
york
times
rule,
i
say
there
is
evidence
of
reckless
disregard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that?
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
appendix?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reasons
for
judgment
at
page
141
of
the
record,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
154
then,
would
it
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
this
in
focus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
then
he
did
say,
"well,
i'll
look
at
this
evidence
in
light
of
the
new
york
times
rule
which
i
must
apply."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
--
and
then
he
analyzes
it
from
157
and
158
and
he
said
this
satisfies
the
new
york
times
rule
and
what's
your
position
that
that
evidence
could
not
possibly
satisfy
the
new
york
times
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
we
don't
--
i
guess
this
really
for
us
narrows
down
to
the
single
question
whether
there
was
evidence
upon
which
there
could
have
been
--
a
finding
could
be
made
that
this
was
done
with
reckless
disregard
or
whether
it
was
true
or
false.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
concededly
it
false?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
our
purposes
that
it's
false,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
it's
that
narrow
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
well,
can
that
make
any
difference
for
our
purposes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
supreme
court
has
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
this
action
is
an
action
governed
by
the
new
york
times
rule,
we
find
that
the
rule
was
satisfied
because
it
was
enough
evidence
upon
which
a
finding
could
be
based
that
this
was
false
and
it
was
altered
in
uttered
disregard
or
whether
it
was
true
or
false
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
reckless
disregard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
see
any
issue
for
us
to
decide
in
light
of
what
your
supreme
court
has
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
for
us
to
decide
but
whether
this
evidence
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
new
york
times
test
go
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
something
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that's
also
a
federal
question
that
on
the
facts
we
might
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
a
captain
of
the
uniform
police
at
least
a
public
man.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
is
didn't
in
the
butts
cases,
didn't
we
apply
the
new
york
times
test
to
the
public
man
as
well
as
to
the
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
