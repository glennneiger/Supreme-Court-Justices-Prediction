well,
aren't
these
an

that
are
more
important
in

elected

justice

so
you
can
use
that
as
a

can
you?
justice
thurgood

so
you
don't
think
anybody
in
the
sheriff's
office
could
be

a

you
surely
don't
mean
that.

a
very
good
answer.
but
let
me
tell
you
this
too
and
i
pointed
it
out
in
my
short
brief
and
the
court
commented
on
this
in
your
latest
curtis
versus
butts
case
that
this
man
occupied
a
position
where
he
could
not
rebut
anything,
mr.
st
amant
said.
here's
a
man
on
state
wide
television
taking
out
after
senator
long
and
just
answered
that
alleging,
defaming
a
few
others.
but
here's
a
man
who's
a
captain
on
the
sheriff's
force,
how
is
he
going
to
buy
equal
time
where
he'd
be
heard
equally.
would
his
voice
be
as
strong?
and
you
commented
on
this
in
the
curtis
case.
and
i
say
it
differentiates
all
together
that
if
something
else
besides
with
what's
a
malice,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
with
the
trial
judge
who
watched
this
man
on
the
stand,
saw
his
demeanor,
the
manner
in
which
he
testified
was
amply
correct
and
the
fact
that
this
man
had
a
complete
utter
disregard
of
captain
thompson's
reputation
of
how
it
affected
him
all
together.
and
i
submit
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
on
finding
malice
and
i
submit
that
all
three
courts
were
wrong
in
holding
a
public
official
made
them
for
personal
reasons.
i
cannot
say
where
it
fits
in.
the
new
york
times,
rosenblatt,
curtis,
walker
case
but
i
submit
that
they
were
--
that
the
case
has
been
--
the
rules
have
been
considered,
they
have
been
applied
and
the
facts
have
been
amply
considered
and
malice
found.

you.
