mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
mr.
thompson
and
i
represented
mr.
thompson's
inception
of
this
lawsuit
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
a
few
of
the
facts
that
led
up
to
this
litigation
and
have
been
little
--
i
wont
say
misstated
but
not
properly
stated
to
show
that
proper
perspective
under
which
in
the
circumstances
under
which
this
case
arose.
mr.
phil
a.
st.
amant
was
a
retired
lieutenant
colonel
from
the
army.
he
qualified
for
the
office
of
the
united
state
senator
running
against
the
incumbent
russell
b.
long
in
1962
prior
to
june
27,
1962
he
prepared
a
television
film
and
on
this
film
he
had
certain
people
appear
to
make
statements
among
which
was
one
mr.
j.d.
alban
(ph),
one
who
had
a
known
criminal
record.
now,
upon
being
and
he
showed
this
at
a
pre-television
show
at
the
capital
house
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana
to
the
news
people.
the
news
--
the
television
station
being
aware
of
this,
spoke
to
their
counsel,
they
advised
mr.
st.
amant
to
the
effect
that
they
--
while
they
had
to
give
him
equal
time
as
a
candidate
for
public
office
on
the
television
station
that
they
could
not
permit
him
to
let
these
people
appear
mr.
alban
who
was
not
a
candidate
nor
would
--
could
they
run
the
risk
of
being
liable
for
what
he
said.
under
louisiana
statute,
there's
a
specific
statute
that
exempts
radio
and
television
station
from
any
liable
or
deformation
actions
for
anything,
any
political
candidate
says
because
he
have
to
give
him
equal
time.
so,
ruling
this
out,
he
then
had
mr.
alban
prepare
an
affidavit
for
the
television
station.
so
then
instead
of
mr.
alban
appearing
on
the
program
himself
mr.
st.
amant
takes
his
--
this
affidavit
and
he
reads
what
mr.
alban
says
in
a
question
and
answer
forum.
now,
in
this
question
and
answer
forum,
he
starts
off
with
this,
i
have
story
to
reveal
tonight
which
is
so
unusual
that
i
have
both
--
this
time
on
a
television
to
inform
the
public.
this
story
involves
a
well
documented
criminal,
an
ex-convict
who
became
a
labor
chief,
referring
to
mr.
partin.
it
involves
misuse
and
theft
of
union
funds,
dealings
with
communist
official
in
cuba,
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
destroy
evidence
and
destruction
of
that
evidence,
death
resulting
from
a
commission
of
a
felony
and
second
death
by
hit
and
run
by
a
union
car,
again,
referring
to
mr.
partin.
then
he
goes
on
to
infer
that
captain
herman
thompson
who
was
on
this
east
baton
rouge
sheriff's
office
which
is
the
same
as
a
county
sheriff's
office,
we
do
have
police
departments,
had
received
funds
and
they
didn't
know
what
to
do.
they
want
to
predicament.
well,
now,
the
evidence
clearly
show
that
captain
hersman
thompson
in
helping
the
sheriff's
office
to
carry
out
certain
charitable
events
did
participate
in
solicitation
of
funds.
all
of
the
unions
in
the
parish
--
of
these
baton
rouge
contributed
the
--
namely,
the
kid's
baseball
clinic.
the
annual
salvation
(inaudible)
five
roses
and
one
of
captain
herman
thompson's
duties
as
--
in-charge
of
the
uniform
division
is
to
see
that
the
deputies
go
around
and
pick
up
these
funds
and
deliver
them
and
he
went
to
these
teamster's
hall
and
again
he
knew
mr.
partin,
he
had
to
know,
i
mean
his
business
but
they
were
not
close
personal
friends
as
they
refer
to.
they
did
not
socialize
together
anything
else
he
knew
him
personally
through
a
business
connection.
he
went
there,
they
gave
him
these
--
whatever
funds
the
union
had
to
contribute,
he
delivered
them
to
the
sheriff's
secretary,
mrs.
pauline
cox
and
that
testimony
is
in
the
record.
now,
captain
herman
thompson
nor
the
sheriff's
office
was
in
no
way
related
to
--
in
the
--
to
this
political
campaign.
political
campaign
was
between
senator
russell
b.
long
and
mr.
phil
a.
st.
amant.
so,
he
just
opens
up
where
the
scout
is
shot
in
his
speech
and
he
defames
these
all
kind
of
people,
not
only
captain
thompson.
now,
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
filed
a
suit
and
i
alleged
that
they
were
maliciously
made.
the
case
was
tried
in
march
of
1960
--
may
of
1964,
the
new
york
times
case
came
out
march
of
1964.
now,
at
that
time
when
mr.
golden
mills
was
mr.
st.
amant's
attorney
and
he
got
rid
of
him
and
mr.
jack
rogers
took
over
him.
then
between
the
original
decision
in
the
application
for
a
new
trial,
a
mr.
richard
g.
van
buskirk
(ph)
took
over
him.
and
at
no
time
was
any
defense
raised
except
that
of
truth.
they
did
file
an
application
for
a
new
trial,
a
motion
for
truth
--
new
trial
just
arguing
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
law
in
evidence
then
by
way
of
brief,
the
new
york
times
case
was
argued.
i
object
to
the
fifth
time
that
mr.
thompson
was
not
a
public
official
because
under
the
further
elaboration
in
the
rosenblatt
case
he
did
not
fall
in
that
definition.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
the
trial
judge
had
a
new
york
times
decision
completely
in
front
of
him
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
mentioned
it
name,
yes
sir
and
he
concluded
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
no
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
i
think
you
should
decide
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
i
have
never
conceded
and
i
do
not
concede
now
that
this
man
was
a
public
official.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
was
not
one
of
those
individuals
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
so
related
in
the
hierarchy
of
government
that
they
had
a
particular
interest
and
yes,
he
was
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
have
never
concede
although
now
in
the
trial
court
they
found
that
he
was
a
public
official
based
on
state
statutes.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
i'll
only
let
you
know
why
the
supreme
court
said
it
does
so.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
they
just
said
that
he
was
a
deputy
who
would
take
the
place
of
the
sheriff
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
and
he
was
going
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
oh,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any.
he
was
an
elected
official.
he
was
certainly
one
that
ever
one
had
a
particular
interest
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
that's
a
big
assumption
because
he
was
just
a
captain,
sir.
by
that
reasoning,
you
could
say
that
everybody
that
places
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
everyone's
a
deputy.
now,
this
man
was
a
captain
in
charged
of
the
uniform
division.
it's
broken
down,
they
have
captains,
majors,
lieutenant
colonels
and
then
the
sheriff.
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
he
was
a
captain
in
charge
of
the
uniform
record
and
i
--
division
on
(inaudible)
that
in
my
petition.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
was
a
captain
on
the
--
he
held
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
sheriff's
office
for
the
past
east
baton
rouge
in
charged
of
the
uniform
division.
the
uniform
division
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
personally
say
he
is
not
a
public
official
no
sir
because
he
--
no
one
has
any
particular
interest
in
his,
he
doesn't
deal
with
money
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
could
be
an
officer,
a
public
officer,
yes
sir
but
he
such
an
officer
that
the
public
has
such
an
interest
in
his
particular
job
it
would
make
him
a
public
official
within
the
rosenblatt
and
the
times
case.
i
think
he
comes
closer
to
your
reasoning
in
the
butts
case,
curtis
versus
butts
where
you
rejected
that
idea.
they
tried
to
inject
that
because
of
mr.
butts'
low
situation
and
position
with
the
college
and
so
forth
that
he
was
a
public
official
then
you
went
on
to
determine
whether
he
was
a
public
man.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
guess
he's
a
public
man
just
like
a
lawyer
would
be
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
you
applied
it
in
the
public
man,
to
butts
but
you
upheld
the
--
affirmed
the
decision
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
associate
it.
now,
let
me
tell
you
something,
our
supreme
court
has
from
the
very
beginning,
i
wrote
a
very
exhausted
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
i
covered
all
the
louisiana
law,
i
covered
all
the
federal
law
and
i
attached
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
a
reason
article
entitled
"liable
in
public
men"
written
by
mr.
william
o.
burtons
(ph)
of
the
kentucky
bar.
our
supreme
court
reasonably
reversed
another
case
involving
general
walker
based
upon
the
fact,
i
mean
they
followed
the
decision.
they
said
he's
a
public
man
and
therefore
following
the
latest
decisions
here
with
general
walker.
they
reversed
the
court
of
appeal
and
threw
his
suit
our.
our
supreme
court
has
it
all
the
time.
now,
our
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
our
trial
judge
held
that
the
--
they
were
smarten
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
garrison
case
to
be
very
frankly.
and
they
held
that
--
says
it
would
certainly
follow
that
if
the
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
of
orleans
parish
and
quoted
in
the
garrison
case
to
the
effect
that
both
the
judges
have
now
made
it
eloquently
clear
where
their
sympathies
lie
in
regard
to
aggressive
vice
investigation
by
refusing
authorized
used
of
the
da's
funds
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
closing
down
the
(inaudible)
is
not
libelous
under
new
york
times
rule
perhaps
is
the
application
of
the
civil
rule
of
libelous
announced
by
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
to
criminal
libel
in
louisiana
court,
then
certainly
the
statements
made
by
the
defendant
mr.
st.
amant
in
the
present
case
would
not
be
libelous
under
that
rule
or
how
they
went
on
to
say
that
he
engaged
in
the
mud-slinging
of
the
worst
type
and
these
actions
were
extremely
defamatory
to
this
man.
now,
the
trial
judge
in
finding
that
malice
actually
just
--
it
didn't
equate
ignorance
with
knowledge
as
counsel
for
mr.
st.
amant
says.
what
the
trial
judge
said,
he
went
into
it
very
detail
and
he
asked
mr.
st.
amant
personally.
did
you
know
mr.
thompson.
no
sir,
i
didn't
know
mr.
thompson.
why
did
you
make
the
statements?
well,
it
was
a
matter
which
i
had
a
lot
of
great
concern."
secondly,
and
i
asked
him,
did
you
just
make
the
statement
and
then
let
him
--
let
the
public
hear
him
and
let
them
draw
what
inferences
as
they
wanted
to."
he
said,
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
you
didn't
care
about
mr.
thompson.
oh,
he
says,
no
sir.
he's
the
farthest
thing
from
my
mind.
and
he
just
went
on
and
libeled
this
man
who
had
a
tremendous
reputation,
he
was
a
graduate
of
fbi
national
academy,
the
academy
at
(inaudible).
he's
attended
all
kind
of
law
enforcement
agencies
or
institutes
and
in
complete
disregard
of
whether
he
was
a
second
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
say
personally,
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
my
criteria
sir
would
be
this
that
if
this
man
occupied
a
position
that
he
is
a
public
employee
or
public
officer
and
that
his
position
was
such
that
the
public
as
you
said
in
rosenblatt
case
have
such
a
particular
interest.
in
other
words,
like
in
rosenblatt,
this
man
was
in
charged
of
running
a
resort
and
handling
funds
and
things
like
this.
captain
thompson
true
was
a
public
officer
and
the
people
had
an
interest
in
him
as
a
sheriff
but
not
a
particular
interest
above
that
they
would
have
for
all
deputy
sheriffs.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
and
all
the
sheriffs.
well,
no
sir.
i
think
if
you
had
an
elected
official
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
can
turn
on
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
i
don't
mean
that,
no
sir.
there
are
those
who
are
higher
in
rank
and
who
is
--
when
the
sheriff
is
gone
like
a
lieutenant
colonel
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
who
have
--
they
have
majors,
lieutenant
colonels,
they
have
a
sheriff
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
just
have
to
tell
you
i
don't
know.
i've
read
all
the
cases.
i've
tried
to
say
it
of
course
i
have
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
i
have
deep
personal
interest
in
this.
this
man
is
a
close
friend,
a
(inaudible)
buddy,
a
neighbor,
a
drinking
buddy
and
everything
else.
and
i
just
never
considered
him
a
public
official,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
mr.
thompson
and
i
represented
mr.
thompson's
inception
of
this
lawsuit
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
a
few
of
the
facts
that
led
up
to
this
litigation
and
have
been
little
--
i
wont
say
misstated
but
not
properly
stated
to
show
that
proper
perspective
under
which
in
the
circumstances
under
which
this
case
arose.
mr.
phil
a.
st.
amant
was
a
retired
lieutenant
colonel
from
the
army.
he
qualified
for
the
office
of
the
united
state
senator
running
against
the
incumbent
russell
b.
long
in
1962
prior
to
june
27,
1962
he
prepared
a
television
film
and
on
this
film
he
had
certain
people
appear
to
make
statements
among
which
was
one
mr.
j.d.
alban
(ph),
one
who
had
a
known
criminal
record.
now,
upon
being
and
he
showed
this
at
a
pre-television
show
at
the
capital
house
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana
to
the
news
people.
the
news
--
the
television
station
being
aware
of
this,
spoke
to
their
counsel,
they
advised
mr.
st.
amant
to
the
effect
that
they
--
while
they
had
to
give
him
equal
time
as
a
candidate
for
public
office
on
the
television
station
that
they
could
not
permit
him
to
let
these
people
appear
mr.
alban
who
was
not
a
candidate
nor
would
--
could
they
run
the
risk
of
being
liable
for
what
he
said.
under
louisiana
statute,
there's
a
specific
statute
that
exempts
radio
and
television
station
from
any
liable
or
deformation
actions
for
anything,
any
political
candidate
says
because
he
have
to
give
him
equal
time.
so,
ruling
this
out,
he
then
had
mr.
alban
prepare
an
affidavit
for
the
television
station.
so
then
instead
of
mr.
alban
appearing
on
the
program
himself
mr.
st.
amant
takes
his
--
this
affidavit
and
he
reads
what
mr.
alban
says
in
a
question
and
answer
forum.
now,
in
this
question
and
answer
forum,
he
starts
off
with
this,
i
have
story
to
reveal
tonight
which
is
so
unusual
that
i
have
both
--
this
time
on
a
television
to
inform
the
public.
this
story
involves
a
well
documented
criminal,
an
ex-convict
who
became
a
labor
chief,
referring
to
mr.
partin.
it
involves
misuse
and
theft
of
union
funds,
dealings
with
communist
official
in
cuba,
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
destroy
evidence
and
destruction
of
that
evidence,
death
resulting
from
a
commission
of
a
felony
and
second
death
by
hit
and
run
by
a
union
car,
again,
referring
to
mr.
partin.
then
he
goes
on
to
infer
that
captain
herman
thompson
who
was
on
this
east
baton
rouge
sheriff's
office
which
is
the
same
as
a
county
sheriff's
office,
we
do
have
police
departments,
had
received
funds
and
they
didn't
know
what
to
do.
they
want
to
predicament.
well,
now,
the
evidence
clearly
show
that
captain
hersman
thompson
in
helping
the
sheriff's
office
to
carry
out
certain
charitable
events
did
participate
in
solicitation
of
funds.
all
of
the
unions
in
the
parish
--
of
these
baton
rouge
contributed
the
--
namely,
the
kid's
baseball
clinic.
the
annual
salvation
(inaudible)
five
roses
and
one
of
captain
herman
thompson's
duties
as
--
in-charge
of
the
uniform
division
is
to
see
that
the
deputies
go
around
and
pick
up
these
funds
and
deliver
them
and
he
went
to
these
teamster's
hall
and
again
he
knew
mr.
partin,
he
had
to
know,
i
mean
his
business
but
they
were
not
close
personal
friends
as
they
refer
to.
they
did
not
socialize
together
anything
else
he
knew
him
personally
through
a
business
connection.
he
went
there,
they
gave
him
these
--
whatever
funds
the
union
had
to
contribute,
he
delivered
them
to
the
sheriff's
secretary,
mrs.
pauline
cox
and
that
testimony
is
in
the
record.
now,
captain
herman
thompson
nor
the
sheriff's
office
was
in
no
way
related
to
--
in
the
--
to
this
political
campaign.
political
campaign
was
between
senator
russell
b.
long
and
mr.
phil
a.
st.
amant.
so,
he
just
opens
up
where
the
scout
is
shot
in
his
speech
and
he
defames
these
all
kind
of
people,
not
only
captain
thompson.
now,
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
filed
a
suit
and
i
alleged
that
they
were
maliciously
made.
the
case
was
tried
in
march
of
1960
--
may
of
1964,
the
new
york
times
case
came
out
march
of
1964.
now,
at
that
time
when
mr.
golden
mills
was
mr.
st.
amant's
attorney
and
he
got
rid
of
him
and
mr.
jack
rogers
took
over
him.
then
between
the
original
decision
in
the
application
for
a
new
trial,
a
mr.
richard
g.
van
buskirk
(ph)
took
over
him.
and
at
no
time
was
any
defense
raised
except
that
of
truth.
they
did
file
an
application
for
a
new
trial,
a
motion
for
truth
--
new
trial
just
arguing
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
law
in
evidence
then
by
way
of
brief,
the
new
york
times
case
was
argued.
i
object
to
the
fifth
time
that
mr.
thompson
was
not
a
public
official
because
under
the
further
elaboration
in
the
rosenblatt
case
he
did
not
fall
in
that
definition.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
the
trial
judge
had
a
new
york
times
decision
completely
in
front
of
him
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
mentioned
it
name,
yes
sir
and
he
concluded
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
no
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
i
think
you
should
decide
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
i
have
never
conceded
and
i
do
not
concede
now
that
this
man
was
a
public
official.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
was
not
one
of
those
individuals
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
so
related
in
the
hierarchy
of
government
that
they
had
a
particular
interest
and
yes,
he
was
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
have
never
concede
although
now
in
the
trial
court
they
found
that
he
was
a
public
official
based
on
state
statutes.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
i'll
only
let
you
know
why
the
supreme
court
said
it
does
so.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
they
just
said
that
he
was
a
deputy
who
would
take
the
place
of
the
sheriff
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
and
he
was
going
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
oh,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any.
he
was
an
elected
official.
he
was
certainly
one
that
ever
one
had
a
particular
interest
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
that's
a
big
assumption
because
he
was
just
a
captain,
sir.
by
that
reasoning,
you
could
say
that
everybody
that
places
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir,
everyone's
a
deputy.
now,
this
man
was
a
captain
in
charged
of
the
uniform
division.
it's
broken
down,
they
have
captains,
majors,
lieutenant
colonels
and
then
the
sheriff.
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
he
was
a
captain
in
charge
of
the
uniform
record
and
i
--
division
on
(inaudible)
that
in
my
petition.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
was
a
captain
on
the
--
he
held
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
sheriff's
office
for
the
past
east
baton
rouge
in
charged
of
the
uniform
division.
the
uniform
division
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
personally
say
he
is
not
a
public
official
no
sir
because
he
--
no
one
has
any
particular
interest
in
his,
he
doesn't
deal
with
money
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
he
could
be
an
officer,
a
public
officer,
yes
sir
but
he
such
an
officer
that
the
public
has
such
an
interest
in
his
particular
job
it
would
make
him
a
public
official
within
the
rosenblatt
and
the
times
case.
i
think
he
comes
closer
to
your
reasoning
in
the
butts
case,
curtis
versus
butts
where
you
rejected
that
idea.
they
tried
to
inject
that
because
of
mr.
butts'
low
situation
and
position
with
the
college
and
so
forth
that
he
was
a
public
official
then
you
went
on
to
determine
whether
he
was
a
public
man.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
guess
he's
a
public
man
just
like
a
lawyer
would
be
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
you
applied
it
in
the
public
man,
to
butts
but
you
upheld
the
--
affirmed
the
decision
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
associate
it.
now,
let
me
tell
you
something,
our
supreme
court
has
from
the
very
beginning,
i
wrote
a
very
exhausted
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
i
covered
all
the
louisiana
law,
i
covered
all
the
federal
law
and
i
attached
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
a
reason
article
entitled
"liable
in
public
men"
written
by
mr.
william
o.
burtons
(ph)
of
the
kentucky
bar.
our
supreme
court
reasonably
reversed
another
case
involving
general
walker
based
upon
the
fact,
i
mean
they
followed
the
decision.
they
said
he's
a
public
man
and
therefore
following
the
latest
decisions
here
with
general
walker.
they
reversed
the
court
of
appeal
and
threw
his
suit
our.
our
supreme
court
has
it
all
the
time.
now,
our
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
our
trial
judge
held
that
the
--
they
were
smarten
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
garrison
case
to
be
very
frankly.
and
they
held
that
--
says
it
would
certainly
follow
that
if
the
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
of
orleans
parish
and
quoted
in
the
garrison
case
to
the
effect
that
both
the
judges
have
now
made
it
eloquently
clear
where
their
sympathies
lie
in
regard
to
aggressive
vice
investigation
by
refusing
authorized
used
of
the
da's
funds
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
closing
down
the
(inaudible)
is
not
libelous
under
new
york
times
rule
perhaps
is
the
application
of
the
civil
rule
of
libelous
announced
by
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
to
criminal
libel
in
louisiana
court,
then
certainly
the
statements
made
by
the
defendant
mr.
st.
amant
in
the
present
case
would
not
be
libelous
under
that
rule
or
how
they
went
on
to
say
that
he
engaged
in
the
mud-slinging
of
the
worst
type
and
these
actions
were
extremely
defamatory
to
this
man.
now,
the
trial
judge
in
finding
that
malice
actually
just
--
it
didn't
equate
ignorance
with
knowledge
as
counsel
for
mr.
st.
amant
says.
what
the
trial
judge
said,
he
went
into
it
very
detail
and
he
asked
mr.
st.
amant
personally.
did
you
know
mr.
thompson.
no
sir,
i
didn't
know
mr.
thompson.
why
did
you
make
the
statements?
well,
it
was
a
matter
which
i
had
a
lot
of
great
concern."
secondly,
and
i
asked
him,
did
you
just
make
the
statement
and
then
let
him
--
let
the
public
hear
him
and
let
them
draw
what
inferences
as
they
wanted
to."
he
said,
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
you
didn't
care
about
mr.
thompson.
oh,
he
says,
no
sir.
he's
the
farthest
thing
from
my
mind.
and
he
just
went
on
and
libeled
this
man
who
had
a
tremendous
reputation,
he
was
a
graduate
of
fbi
national
academy,
the
academy
at
(inaudible).
he's
attended
all
kind
of
law
enforcement
agencies
or
institutes
and
in
complete
disregard
of
whether
he
was
a
second
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
say
personally,
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
my
criteria
sir
would
be
this
that
if
this
man
occupied
a
position
that
he
is
a
public
employee
or
public
officer
and
that
his
position
was
such
that
the
public
as
you
said
in
rosenblatt
case
have
such
a
particular
interest.
in
other
words,
like
in
rosenblatt,
this
man
was
in
charged
of
running
a
resort
and
handling
funds
and
things
like
this.
captain
thompson
true
was
a
public
officer
and
the
people
had
an
interest
in
him
as
a
sheriff
but
not
a
particular
interest
above
that
they
would
have
for
all
deputy
sheriffs.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
and
all
the
sheriffs.
well,
no
sir.
i
think
if
you
had
an
elected
official
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
i
can
turn
on
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
well,
i
don't
mean
that,
no
sir.
there
are
those
who
are
higher
in
rank
and
who
is
--
when
the
sheriff
is
gone
like
a
lieutenant
colonel
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
who
have
--
they
have
majors,
lieutenant
colonels,
they
have
a
sheriff
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
just
have
to
tell
you
i
don't
know.
i've
read
all
the
cases.
i've
tried
to
say
it
of
course
i
have
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
kleinpeter
--
i
have
deep
personal
interest
in
this.
this
man
is
a
close
friend,
a
(inaudible)
buddy,
a
neighbor,
a
drinking
buddy
and
everything
else.
and
i
just
never
considered
him
a
public
official,
yes
sir.
