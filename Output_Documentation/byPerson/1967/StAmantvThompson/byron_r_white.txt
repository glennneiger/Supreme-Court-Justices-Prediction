justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
point
here
--
you're
--
you
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
answering
yes
and
say
that
whatever
evidence
arisen,
this
record
didn't
amount
to
reckless
disregard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
--
what
if
his
informer
had
been
a
known
lawyer,
a
notorious
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
not
knowledge
of
folly,
he
didn't
actually
know
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
just
knew
that
--
he
would've
had
enough
suspicion
of
the
source
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
had
never
seen
or
heard
to
this
fellow
before,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
doesn't
mean
much
--
i
don't
suppose
--
what
if
he
got
the
affidavit
from
partin?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
a
union
official.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
a
union
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
who
brought
the
ad
to
the
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
brought
the
ad
to
the
new
york
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
known
to
the
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
from
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
people
they
knew.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
anybody
who
gets
an
affidavit
from
anybody
else
with
scandalous
charges
is
in
about
third
person
may
publish
it
and
freely.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
party
who
brings
the
suits
says
this
does
amount
to
reckless
disregard
when
all
you've
done
has
taken
an
affidavit
from
some
person,
this
contains
a
scandalous
charge
against
a
public
official
and
that
fellow
just,
"well,
i've
got
it
from
somebody
and
he
signed
an
affidavit
that
i'm
not
reckless
at
all
if
i
publish
this."
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
even
malice
under
new
york
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it's
the
truth?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
if
he
has
--
what
if
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
isn't
the
truth
and
--
but
do
you
think
it
would
be
changed
in
this
case
in
these
facts
if
the
fellow
testified
that
i
did
it
because
i
hated
him
although
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
certainly
thought
they
were
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
in
your
--
but
your
supreme
court
said
he
was
a
public
official
for
the
new
york
times
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know,
i
know,
i
read
it.
now,
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
would
you

the

would
you
think
the
sheriff
would
be
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
sheriff?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
your
court
said,
well
the
deputy
sheriff
is
--
when
a
sheriff
isn't
around
he's
a
sheriff.
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
on
the
force
was
a
deputy,
was
everyone
on
the
sheriff's
staff
called
a
deputy?
justice
byron

so
your

you're

you
answer
