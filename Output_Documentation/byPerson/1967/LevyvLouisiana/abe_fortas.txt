justice

fortas
do
you
have
that
(voice
overlap)
in
reference
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
are
there
other
types
of
distinctions
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
in
the
statutory
law
or
case
law
of
various
states?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
louisiana
now
is
the
only
state
that
denies
that.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
it's
applicable
only
to
former
slaves
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
hadn't
feel
it
anyway
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
mrs.--
that
the
fact
that
mrs.--
the
appellant
here
mrs.
levy
was
a
negro,
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
case,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
the
other
states
get
along
with
that
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
the
other
states
survive
the
(voice
overlap)
of
that
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
difference
does
that
make
the
same
problem
of
examining
title?
justice
abe
fortas
a
man
dies
and
testate
and
the
property
is
inherited
by
x,
y
and
z
and
that
appears
in
the
chain
of
title
and
no
matter
what
the
state
is,
we've
got
a
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
faces
for
the
statute
on
the
morals
and
general
welfare
because
it
discourages
bringing
children
into
the
world
out
of
wedlock.
they
didn't
say
anything
about
this
forced
heir,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
any
other
decisions
or
what's
the
basis
for
your
statement?
is
it
the
logic
of
the
situation
or
do
you
have
any
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
the
louisiana
and
neither
the
legislature
nor
the
court
has
said
that,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
i
suppose
there
were
debates
before
the
statute
was
amended
in
"66"
justice
abe
fortas
so
this
is
just
your
deduction.
justice
abe
fortas
professor
dorsen
may
i
ask
you.
you
said
you
would
file
a
memorandum
stating
the
distinctions
that
are
made
in
various
state
laws
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
will
you
cover
aspects
of
that
subject
