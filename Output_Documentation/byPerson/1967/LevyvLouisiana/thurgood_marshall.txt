well
mr.
porteous,
let's
get
to
the
other
point
about
classification.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
have
no
objection
to
the
federal
court
intervening
in
cases
involving
corporations
and
insurance
companies
against
invidious
classifications,
that's
alright,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
basis
is
therefore
this
classification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
classify
illegitimate
children
as
illegitimate
children
and
not
as
children?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
those
that
have
abolished
this
distinction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
have
50.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
louisiana,
now
why
does
louisiana
say
that
a
child
who
do
no
fault
of
his
own
happens
to
be
illegitimate
is
denied
the
right
to
recover?
why
is
it
that
louisiana
says
that
people
who
are
guilty
of
wrongful
death
can
be
excused
from
payment
for
that
if
the
child
is
illegitimate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
you
wish.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
have
to
relate
that
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
discriminating
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
been
changed
in
the
enlightened
state,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
say
that
solely
because
a
child
is
illegitimate,
a
child
is
denied
rights
that
he
would
have
if
his
parents
had
married
before
he
was
born?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
child
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
among
those
items
could
a
child
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
solely
because
of
what
the
parents
did,
the
child
lose
his
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
this
--
when
was
this
statute
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
the
original?
