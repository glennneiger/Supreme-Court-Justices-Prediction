mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
gentlemen,
every
equal
protection
of
the
law's
case
and
we're
dealing
with
the
state
statute,
ultimately
comes
down
to
a
problem
of
federalism.
how
far
are
we
going
to
go
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
is
it
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
national
power
will
be
asserted
all
the
things
traditionally
reserved
to
the
states?
we
submit
the
answer
should
be
in
the
negative.
it
was
never
conceived
as
such
was
conceived
to
protect
those
persons
for
whom
this
great
nation
fought
a
long
war.
gentlemen
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
do
not
mean
this.
it's
just
that
i
don't
mean
to
so
limit
it
sir.
the
whole
history
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
the
contrary,
however,
i'm
coming
to
the
fact
that
in
the
whole
spectrum
of
equal
protection
litigation,
we
have
two
criteria
which
emerged.
one,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
racist
or
racial
statute,
this
court
has
applied
one
set
of
standards.
the
statute
is
automatically
has
it
were
suspect.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
don't
believe
it
does,
if
your
honor
please.
however,
the
assertion
is
made
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellant
that
in
louisiana,
90%
of
the
children
who
were
born
illegitimate
are
colored
and
that
therefore,
this
statute
is
some
covert
form
of
discrimination
against
the
colored
race.
this
is
asserted
in
the
briefs,
and
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
say
that
the
whole
history
of
our
wrongful
death
statute
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
if
you
examine
the
louisiana
cases
on
the
subject,
you
will
find
that
race
is
very
rarely
even
mentioned.
the
race
of
the
various
parties
is
very
rarely
even
mentioned
in
the
decisions
and
i
can
assure
you
i
know
of
no
cases
where
it
was
applied,
where
the
statute
was
given
in
favor
of
white
illegitimates
and
taken
away
in
favor
of
colored
illegitimates.
i
know
no
such
case
but
the
assertion
is
made
that
this
is
a
race
statute
and
i
submit
that
the
appellants
are
therefore
trying
to
bring
this
statute
within
the
purview
of
those
cases
loving
versus
virginia,
korematsu,
hirabayashi
etcetera,
where
the
statute
is
automatically
a
suspect
and
only
the
most
overriding
public
policies
may
justify
it.
however,
with
regard
to
other
matters
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
we
must
ask
the
question
whether
or
not
the
discrimination
is
invidious.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
are
you
talking
about
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
legislation
by
its
very
nature
must
be
classified.
i
submit
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
classifying
lots
of
corporations
and
individuals
daily.
it's
fundamental
to
legislation
classification
is.
if
we
could
treat
everybody
equally
the
same,
we
would
certainly
indeed
have
a
wonderful
system
but
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that
the
law
has
a
very
definite
reason
for
this
and
they
are
well-grounded
in
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
of
all
the
other
states
of
this
nation.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
distinction
has
not
been
entirely
obliterated.
in
many
states,
i
would
submit
contrary
to
my
friend
mr.
dorsen
that
new
york,
pennsylvania,
indiana,
new
jersey
would
not
permit
this
type
of
action
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
we
have
50?
many
of
them
have
not
passed
on
it,
if
your
honor
please.
many
of
them
linked
the
action
for
wrongful
death
to
the
rights
of
descent
in
distribution
and
in
numerable
states
i
submit.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor,
please
may
i
start
with
the
last
question
and
work
back
to
first.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
first
of
all,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
legitimate
relative
with
the
right
of
action.
the
tort
fees
are
--
would
have
had
to
pay
presuming
he
was
negligent.
that
person,
however,
did
not
assert
the
cause
of
action.
that
was
the
mother
of
louise
levy
who
still
had
the
cause
of
action
under
our
article
2315.
unfortunately
for
her,
she
filed
a
lawsuit
too
late
and
was
time
barred.
now,
therefore
the
tort
fees
or
does
not
as
it
were
escaped.
secondly,
turning
to
the
public
policy,
you
should
not,
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit,
consider
the
statute
in
vacuum
by
itself.
you
have
to
consider
that
it
is
part
of
the
entire
law
of
louisiana
wherein
we're
dealing
with
problems
in
forced
heirship,
community
property
where
rights
in
family,
status
in
family,
translate
into
rights
in
property.
if
your
honor
please,
usually
when
the
father
or
mother
as
it
were
has
passed
away,
the
person
necessary
to
defeat
the
claims
of
a
legitimate
or
illegitimate
lies
dead.
and
louisiana
largely,
i
submit,
because
of
its
unique
forced
heirship
system
will
not
allow
illegitimate
children
to
participate
in
what
the
law
reserves
in
louisiana
to
the
legitimate
family,
the
wife
and
the
legitimate
children.
there's
a
public
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
that's
unique
to
our
forced
heirship
system
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
we
certainly
do
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
definitely
a
rational
basis,
a
rational
public
policy
on
the
part
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
this
you
classified
as
discrimination
has
been
part
of
our
law
in
this
united
states,
these
50
states
since
--
well,
i'm
sure
they
came
in
to
existence.
we
have
discriminated
with
the
regard
to
rights
and
inheritance.
illegitimate
children
had
no
right
to
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
some,
yes.
others,
i
submit
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
or
after
he
was
born,
or
had
bothered
to
appear
before
a
notary
and
acknowledge
him.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
no,
the
parents.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
a
child
could
do
nothing.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
first
of
all,
i
should
also
say
dealing
with
the
privilege
here,
the
privilege
of
bringing
this
action.
as
conferred
by
the
state,
it
is
not
a
right
as
such.
this
is
not
a
fundamental
first
amendment
right,
we
would
submit.
and
to
continue
answering
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
--
you
refer
to
enlightened
states.
it's
very
interesting
that
all
of
this
is
being
done
by
the
legislatures
of
these
various
states.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
legislate
with
respect
to
the
family
law
of
the
states.
it's
quite
obviously
a
legislative
matter
reserved
to
the
wisdom
of
the
various
state
legislatures.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
forced
heirship
is
this.
if
a
man
dies
and
leaves
property,
he
cannot
dispose
of
it
indiscriminately
by
will.
he
must
leave
--
his
wife
gets
half
of
course
in
the
community
but
the
remainder
of
the
half,
if
he
has
one
child,
that
child
must
have
a
third.
if
he
has
two
children,
that
child
then
or
the
children
then
must
get
50%
and
he
is
free
to
dispose
a
50%.
if
he
has
three
children,
it
would
be
66
and
two-thirds
percent
which
must
go
to
the
children.
now,
when
we
consider
the
title
to
real
property,
title
examiners
must
examine
in
to
the
whole
family
history
of
a
human
being
to
make
sure
some
heir
hasn't
been
left
out.
hence,
you
can
begin
to
appreciate
why
the
question
of
status
in
family
is
so
important
to
a
state
like
louisiana?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
sir?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
excuse
me.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
other
states
have
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
it's
slightly
different
in
examining
a
title.
you
can
look
at
the
man's
will.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
would
be
--
that
i
would
agree
with
you
if
your
honor
please.
but
let
us
assume
and
add
to
it
that
the
man
has
left
a
will
then
has
he
properly
disposed
of
his
property?
that
is
the
next
question.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
you
couldn't
disinherit
your
legitimate
children
anywhere
you
want,
except
if
they,
i
believe
made
an
attempt
on
your
life
or
something
such
as
that.
and
all
of
these
goes
back
ultimately
to
something
found
in
the
code
napoleon.
a
strong
family
tradition
of
legitimacy
caring
for
the
heirs,
caring
for
the
members
of
the
family,
correct
familial
status
at
roman
law
in
the
original
french
civil
law
was
so
all
important
and
that
remains
as
part
of
louisiana's
public
policy
to
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
indeed,
it
is
not
sir.
we
submit
that
louisiana
has
done
her
best,
has
recognized
the
problem
of
illegitimacy
and
attempted
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
social
interests
as
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i,
my
personal
feelings
would
be
that
idea
that
illegitimacy
is
a
deterrent
certainly
is
not
a
very
effective
force.
i
will
conceive
that.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
submit
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
well,
if
your
honor
please,
if
we
submit
that
the
rational
basis
as
such
lies
in
this
whole
public
policy
respecting
that.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that's
what
i
stand
on.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
part
of
the
overall
policy,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
was
thinking
further
along
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
asked.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
in
the
interest,
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit
at
the
state
policy
or
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
forced
heirship
is
simply
this.
you
could
not
disinherit
your
legitimate
children
by
will.
they're
entitled
to
a
certain
portion
of
your
estate
and
it's
important
therefore
that
we
know
definitely
who
your
children
are.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
see.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
imagine
that
certainly
and
probably
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
think
so.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
upon
the
birth
of
any
child
sir,
the
physician
or
midwife,
we
do
have
some
midwives
left
is
by
statute,
bound
to
certify
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir,
it
normally
is
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
with
both.
anyone
in
attendance
have
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
generally
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
children
in
this
particular
case,
the
matter
in
which
it
was
proven
that
they
were
in
fact
the
legitimate
was
by
the
introduction
of
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
the
present
form
of
the
statute
was
i
believe
its
last
amendment
was
probably
1966.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it
probably
goes
back
to
before
the
code
of
1870
sometime
i
believe
within
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir,
it
was.
i
submit
that
since
the
decision
that
all
of
that
must
go
by
the
board
and
rightly
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
with
regard
to
slaves?
yes.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
indeed
it
doesn't
if
your
honor
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
the
logic
of
the
situation.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
this
is
the
very
first
declaration
and
i
submit
that
we
have
by
any
court.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
none
of
this
is
recorded
unfortunately
in
our
state,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
this,
we
submit
is
the
logic
of
the
situation
and
we
believe
that
under
the
rules
of
morey
versus
doud
and
the
other
cases
that
the
statute
should
be
presumed
to
be
constitutional
in
this
situation
and
a
rational
basis
if
one
can
be
found
presumed
likewise.
and
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
submit
coming
back
to
louisiana
has
recognized
the
problem
of
illegitimacy.man
has
attempted
to
balance
the
competing
social
interests.
she
has
provided
a
very
ready
and
easy
means
whereby
persons
of
illegitimate
birth
may
be
legitimated.
the
subsequent
marriage
of
their
parents
and
informal
acknowledgement
as
where
the
children
would
live
with
them
would
make
those
children
legitimate.
likewise,
the
appearance
before
a
notary
and
two
witnesses
to
the
effect
that
this
is
my
child
effectively
legitimates
the
child.
louisiana
has
also
recognized
that
illegitimates
have
a
very
limited
right
of
inheritance
when
there
are
no
legitimate
heirs
and
illegitimate
may
be
called
to
the
inheritance
of
a
parent.
louisiana
has
provided
means
and
statutory
means
whereby
they
may
prove
their
proper
heirship
and
the
rules
of
evidence
are
set
out
in
the
civil
code
in
that
regard.
but
if
your
honor
please,
louisiana
also
has
an
interest
in
preserving
legitimate
family
relationships
in
strengthening
a
preference
in
favor
of
the
legitimate
relations
as
opposed
to
the
less
fortunate
illegitimates
and
this
is
part
of
the
public
policy
of
the
state
and
we
submit
therefore
it
has
a
very
rational
basis.
furthermore,
closing,
we
would
state
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
never
intended
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
the
equal
protection
of
the
law's
clause
was
intended
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
the
national
government
might
obtain
power
with
regard
to
those
matters
traditionally
committed
to
the
states.
gentlemen,
we,
on
behalf
of
clients,
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
the
legitimate
child
sir,
would
take
precedents.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
assuming
she
left
no
will.
if
she
had
left
a
will
with
one
child
in
the
situation
which
you
posit,
she
would
have
had
to
have
left
one-third
to
that
legitimate
child
and
the
remaining
two-third,
she
could
have
done
with
as
she
pleased.
but
if
there
were
no
will
then
she
would
have
had
to,
everything
would
have
gone
to
that
one
legitimate
child.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
gentlemen,
every
equal
protection
of
the
law's
case
and
we're
dealing
with
the
state
statute,
ultimately
comes
down
to
a
problem
of
federalism.
how
far
are
we
going
to
go
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
is
it
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
national
power
will
be
asserted
all
the
things
traditionally
reserved
to
the
states?
we
submit
the
answer
should
be
in
the
negative.
it
was
never
conceived
as
such
was
conceived
to
protect
those
persons
for
whom
this
great
nation
fought
a
long
war.
gentlemen
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
do
not
mean
this.
it's
just
that
i
don't
mean
to
so
limit
it
sir.
the
whole
history
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
the
contrary,
however,
i'm
coming
to
the
fact
that
in
the
whole
spectrum
of
equal
protection
litigation,
we
have
two
criteria
which
emerged.
one,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
racist
or
racial
statute,
this
court
has
applied
one
set
of
standards.
the
statute
is
automatically
has
it
were
suspect.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
don't
believe
it
does,
if
your
honor
please.
however,
the
assertion
is
made
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellant
that
in
louisiana,
90%
of
the
children
who
were
born
illegitimate
are
colored
and
that
therefore,
this
statute
is
some
covert
form
of
discrimination
against
the
colored
race.
this
is
asserted
in
the
briefs,
and
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
say
that
the
whole
history
of
our
wrongful
death
statute
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
if
you
examine
the
louisiana
cases
on
the
subject,
you
will
find
that
race
is
very
rarely
even
mentioned.
the
race
of
the
various
parties
is
very
rarely
even
mentioned
in
the
decisions
and
i
can
assure
you
i
know
of
no
cases
where
it
was
applied,
where
the
statute
was
given
in
favor
of
white
illegitimates
and
taken
away
in
favor
of
colored
illegitimates.
i
know
no
such
case
but
the
assertion
is
made
that
this
is
a
race
statute
and
i
submit
that
the
appellants
are
therefore
trying
to
bring
this
statute
within
the
purview
of
those
cases
loving
versus
virginia,
korematsu,
hirabayashi
etcetera,
where
the
statute
is
automatically
a
suspect
and
only
the
most
overriding
public
policies
may
justify
it.
however,
with
regard
to
other
matters
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
we
must
ask
the
question
whether
or
not
the
discrimination
is
invidious.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
are
you
talking
about
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
legislation
by
its
very
nature
must
be
classified.
i
submit
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
classifying
lots
of
corporations
and
individuals
daily.
it's
fundamental
to
legislation
classification
is.
if
we
could
treat
everybody
equally
the
same,
we
would
certainly
indeed
have
a
wonderful
system
but
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that
the
law
has
a
very
definite
reason
for
this
and
they
are
well-grounded
in
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
of
all
the
other
states
of
this
nation.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
distinction
has
not
been
entirely
obliterated.
in
many
states,
i
would
submit
contrary
to
my
friend
mr.
dorsen
that
new
york,
pennsylvania,
indiana,
new
jersey
would
not
permit
this
type
of
action
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
we
have
50?
many
of
them
have
not
passed
on
it,
if
your
honor
please.
many
of
them
linked
the
action
for
wrongful
death
to
the
rights
of
descent
in
distribution
and
in
numerable
states
i
submit.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor,
please
may
i
start
with
the
last
question
and
work
back
to
first.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
first
of
all,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
legitimate
relative
with
the
right
of
action.
the
tort
fees
are
--
would
have
had
to
pay
presuming
he
was
negligent.
that
person,
however,
did
not
assert
the
cause
of
action.
that
was
the
mother
of
louise
levy
who
still
had
the
cause
of
action
under
our
article
2315.
unfortunately
for
her,
she
filed
a
lawsuit
too
late
and
was
time
barred.
now,
therefore
the
tort
fees
or
does
not
as
it
were
escaped.
secondly,
turning
to
the
public
policy,
you
should
not,
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit,
consider
the
statute
in
vacuum
by
itself.
you
have
to
consider
that
it
is
part
of
the
entire
law
of
louisiana
wherein
we're
dealing
with
problems
in
forced
heirship,
community
property
where
rights
in
family,
status
in
family,
translate
into
rights
in
property.
if
your
honor
please,
usually
when
the
father
or
mother
as
it
were
has
passed
away,
the
person
necessary
to
defeat
the
claims
of
a
legitimate
or
illegitimate
lies
dead.
and
louisiana
largely,
i
submit,
because
of
its
unique
forced
heirship
system
will
not
allow
illegitimate
children
to
participate
in
what
the
law
reserves
in
louisiana
to
the
legitimate
family,
the
wife
and
the
legitimate
children.
there's
a
public
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
that's
unique
to
our
forced
heirship
system
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
we
certainly
do
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
definitely
a
rational
basis,
a
rational
public
policy
on
the
part
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
this
you
classified
as
discrimination
has
been
part
of
our
law
in
this
united
states,
these
50
states
since
--
well,
i'm
sure
they
came
in
to
existence.
we
have
discriminated
with
the
regard
to
rights
and
inheritance.
illegitimate
children
had
no
right
to
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
some,
yes.
others,
i
submit
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
or
after
he
was
born,
or
had
bothered
to
appear
before
a
notary
and
acknowledge
him.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
no,
the
parents.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
a
child
could
do
nothing.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
first
of
all,
i
should
also
say
dealing
with
the
privilege
here,
the
privilege
of
bringing
this
action.
as
conferred
by
the
state,
it
is
not
a
right
as
such.
this
is
not
a
fundamental
first
amendment
right,
we
would
submit.
and
to
continue
answering
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
--
you
refer
to
enlightened
states.
it's
very
interesting
that
all
of
this
is
being
done
by
the
legislatures
of
these
various
states.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
legislate
with
respect
to
the
family
law
of
the
states.
it's
quite
obviously
a
legislative
matter
reserved
to
the
wisdom
of
the
various
state
legislatures.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
forced
heirship
is
this.
if
a
man
dies
and
leaves
property,
he
cannot
dispose
of
it
indiscriminately
by
will.
he
must
leave
--
his
wife
gets
half
of
course
in
the
community
but
the
remainder
of
the
half,
if
he
has
one
child,
that
child
must
have
a
third.
if
he
has
two
children,
that
child
then
or
the
children
then
must
get
50%
and
he
is
free
to
dispose
a
50%.
if
he
has
three
children,
it
would
be
66
and
two-thirds
percent
which
must
go
to
the
children.
now,
when
we
consider
the
title
to
real
property,
title
examiners
must
examine
in
to
the
whole
family
history
of
a
human
being
to
make
sure
some
heir
hasn't
been
left
out.
hence,
you
can
begin
to
appreciate
why
the
question
of
status
in
family
is
so
important
to
a
state
like
louisiana?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
sir?
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
excuse
me.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
other
states
have
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
it's
slightly
different
in
examining
a
title.
you
can
look
at
the
man's
will.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
would
be
--
that
i
would
agree
with
you
if
your
honor
please.
but
let
us
assume
and
add
to
it
that
the
man
has
left
a
will
then
has
he
properly
disposed
of
his
property?
that
is
the
next
question.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
you
couldn't
disinherit
your
legitimate
children
anywhere
you
want,
except
if
they,
i
believe
made
an
attempt
on
your
life
or
something
such
as
that.
and
all
of
these
goes
back
ultimately
to
something
found
in
the
code
napoleon.
a
strong
family
tradition
of
legitimacy
caring
for
the
heirs,
caring
for
the
members
of
the
family,
correct
familial
status
at
roman
law
in
the
original
french
civil
law
was
so
all
important
and
that
remains
as
part
of
louisiana's
public
policy
to
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
indeed,
it
is
not
sir.
we
submit
that
louisiana
has
done
her
best,
has
recognized
the
problem
of
illegitimacy
and
attempted
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
social
interests
as
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i,
my
personal
feelings
would
be
that
idea
that
illegitimacy
is
a
deterrent
certainly
is
not
a
very
effective
force.
i
will
conceive
that.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
submit
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
well,
if
your
honor
please,
if
we
submit
that
the
rational
basis
as
such
lies
in
this
whole
public
policy
respecting
that.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that's
what
i
stand
on.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
part
of
the
overall
policy,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
was
thinking
further
along
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
asked.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
in
the
interest,
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit
at
the
state
policy
or
forced
heirship.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
forced
heirship
is
simply
this.
you
could
not
disinherit
your
legitimate
children
by
will.
they're
entitled
to
a
certain
portion
of
your
estate
and
it's
important
therefore
that
we
know
definitely
who
your
children
are.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
see.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
imagine
that
certainly
and
probably
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
i
think
so.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
upon
the
birth
of
any
child
sir,
the
physician
or
midwife,
we
do
have
some
midwives
left
is
by
statute,
bound
to
certify
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir,
it
normally
is
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
with
both.
anyone
in
attendance
have
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
generally
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
children
in
this
particular
case,
the
matter
in
which
it
was
proven
that
they
were
in
fact
the
legitimate
was
by
the
introduction
of
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
the
present
form
of
the
statute
was
i
believe
its
last
amendment
was
probably
1966.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it
probably
goes
back
to
before
the
code
of
1870
sometime
i
believe
within
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir,
it
was.
i
submit
that
since
the
decision
that
all
of
that
must
go
by
the
board
and
rightly
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
with
regard
to
slaves?
yes.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
indeed
it
doesn't
if
your
honor
--
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
it's
the
logic
of
the
situation.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
this
is
the
very
first
declaration
and
i
submit
that
we
have
by
any
court.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
none
of
this
is
recorded
unfortunately
in
our
state,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
this,
we
submit
is
the
logic
of
the
situation
and
we
believe
that
under
the
rules
of
morey
versus
doud
and
the
other
cases
that
the
statute
should
be
presumed
to
be
constitutional
in
this
situation
and
a
rational
basis
if
one
can
be
found
presumed
likewise.
and
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
submit
coming
back
to
louisiana
has
recognized
the
problem
of
illegitimacy.man
has
attempted
to
balance
the
competing
social
interests.
she
has
provided
a
very
ready
and
easy
means
whereby
persons
of
illegitimate
birth
may
be
legitimated.
the
subsequent
marriage
of
their
parents
and
informal
acknowledgement
as
where
the
children
would
live
with
them
would
make
those
children
legitimate.
likewise,
the
appearance
before
a
notary
and
two
witnesses
to
the
effect
that
this
is
my
child
effectively
legitimates
the
child.
louisiana
has
also
recognized
that
illegitimates
have
a
very
limited
right
of
inheritance
when
there
are
no
legitimate
heirs
and
illegitimate
may
be
called
to
the
inheritance
of
a
parent.
louisiana
has
provided
means
and
statutory
means
whereby
they
may
prove
their
proper
heirship
and
the
rules
of
evidence
are
set
out
in
the
civil
code
in
that
regard.
but
if
your
honor
please,
louisiana
also
has
an
interest
in
preserving
legitimate
family
relationships
in
strengthening
a
preference
in
favor
of
the
legitimate
relations
as
opposed
to
the
less
fortunate
illegitimates
and
this
is
part
of
the
public
policy
of
the
state
and
we
submit
therefore
it
has
a
very
rational
basis.
furthermore,
closing,
we
would
state
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
never
intended
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
the
equal
protection
of
the
law's
clause
was
intended
to
become
a
vehicle
whereby
the
national
government
might
obtain
power
with
regard
to
those
matters
traditionally
committed
to
the
states.
gentlemen,
we,
on
behalf
of
clients,
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
the
legitimate
child
sir,
would
take
precedents.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
porteous,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
assuming
she
left
no
will.
if
she
had
left
a
will
with
one
child
in
the
situation
which
you
posit,
she
would
have
had
to
have
left
one-third
to
that
legitimate
child
and
the
remaining
two-third,
she
could
have
done
with
as
she
pleased.
but
if
there
were
no
will
then
she
would
have
had
to,
everything
would
have
gone
to
that
one
legitimate
child.
