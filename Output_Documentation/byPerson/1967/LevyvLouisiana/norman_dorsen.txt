mr.
norman
dorsen
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
a
state
can
deny
children
born
to
an
unmarried
woman
the
benefits
of
a
statute
permitting
children
generally
to
sue
for
the
wrongful
death
of
their
mother.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple
and
uncontested.
the
decedent,
mrs.
louise
levy
was
the
mother
of
five
infant
children
whose
interests
are
at
stake
here.
the
children
lived
with
their
mother
and
were
dependent
on
her.
the
defendants
in
the
case
in
this
court
are
dr.
w.j.
wing
of
the
charity
hospital
of
new
orleans
and
an
insurance
company,
the
interstate
fire
&
casualty
company.
on
march
12,
1964,
mrs.
levy
went
to
the
charity
hospital
feeling
ill
and
having
other
symptoms.
she
was
assigned
to
dr.
wing
who
purported
to
examine
here
but
failed
to
take
blood
test
and
make
other
checks.
on
march
19,
mrs.
levy
returned
and
she
was
still
feeling
ill.
dr.
wing
admonished
her
for
not
taking
the
medicine
that
he
had
prescribed
and
he
suggested
that
she
see
a
psychiatrist
and
in
fact,
he
made
an
appointment
with
her
to
see
a
psychiatrist.
on
march
22nd,
mrs.
levy
was
brought
to
the
hospital
in
a
comatose
condition,
on
march
29th,
she
died.
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
louisiana
courts
under
article
2315
of
the
louisiana
code,
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
the
state.
two
elements
of
damages
were
alleged,
totalling
$60,000.00.
$55,000.00
was
alleged
as
the
damages
that
these
children
suffered
for
the
loss
of
their
mother
prior
to
the
age
of
majority.
this
is
the
wrongful
death
element.
$5,000.00
was
alleged
as
the
survivorship
portion
of
the
damages
for
the
decedent's
pain
and
suffering
before
she
died.
after
procedural
matters
were
taken
care
of
in
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
cause
of
action.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
louisiana
and
one
reason
was
given
for
denying
these
illegitimate
children
the
right
to
sue
and
the
words
of
the
louisiana
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
is
"actually
based
on
morals
and
general
welfare
because
it
discourages
bringing
children
into
the
world
out
of
wedlock".
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
did
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
the
supreme
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
correct.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
without
opinion
refused
the
writ
of
error.
it's
the
position
in
this
court
that
the
appellants
take
that
this
application
of
article
2315
is
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
because
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
denying
the
children
rights
on
the
basis
of
suspect
criteria,
the
status
of
illegitimacy.
second,
because
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
on
the
ground
of
a
statutory
classification
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
article
2315.
and
three,
that
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
discrimination
for
there
is
no
valid
state
purpose
and
deprives
the
children
of
rights
on
the
basis
of
a
status
over
which
they
have
no
control.
our
first
point
is
that
the
classification
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
statutory
purpose.
the
principle
in
this
court
is
ancient
and
clear
and
we
quoted
in
the
brief
on
page
9
where
the
court
said
as
long
ago
as
1896
that
the
attempted
classification
must
always
rest
upon
some
difference
which
bears
a
reasonable
and
just
relation
to
the
act
in
respect
to
which
the
classification
is
proposed
and
can
never
be
made
arbitrarily
and
without
any
such
basis.
of
course
more
recent
cases
like
carrington
and
rash
and
mclaughlin
and
florida
adopt
and
apply
this
rule
of
the
court.
the
application
of
this
principle,
it
seems
to
us
is
equally
plain
in
this
case.
it's
the
purpose
of
the
wrongful
death
portion
of
the
statute
to
save
children
harmless
from
the
loss
of
the
material
and
moral
benefits
that
they
would
have
received
if
their
mother
had
lived,
the
mother
in
whom
they
were
dependent,
the
mother
with
whom
they
resided
and
this
of
course
is
the
purpose
of
all
wrongful
death
statutes.
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
it's
wholly
unreasonable
to
discriminate
against
the
illegitimate
children.
they
were
as
close
to
their
mother
as
any
children
could
be.
they
were
fully
dependent
on
her
for
both
the
economic
necessities
and
the
intangibles
of
training,
nurture
and
guidance.
indeed
louisiana
workman's
compensation
law
which
has
been
applied
to
permit
dependence
to
recover
under
the
workman's
compensation
law
even
if
they're
illegitimate,
points
up
in
our
judgement
the
unreasonable
nature
of
the
classification
here.
when
one
turns
to
the
survivorship
portion
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
is
only
slightly
different
but
there
is
an
added
element
and
that
is
to
reinforce
the
deterrent
aspects
of
the
general
tort
law
by
refusing
to
permit
wrongdoers
to
escape
payment.
this
stated
in
the
statute
itself
and
by
an
authoritative
law
review
article
in
louisiana
which
on
page
16
states,
"the
idea
apparently
evolved
that
the
person
responsible
for
the
wrongful
act
should
pay
damages
to
someone
connected
with
the
deceased
whether
or
not
that
person
was
dependent
on
him.
and
of
course
in
this
case,
the
children
were
dependent
on
the
mother
and
there
is
no
reason
that
i
can
think
of
and
no
reason
has
been
suggested,
i
respectfully
say
to
the
court,
why
this
children
like
any
other
children
should
not
be
able
to
bring
this
course
of
action
on
behalf
of
their
--
in
their
status
as
dependents
and
children
of
the
mother
with
whom
they
lived.
now,
the
justification,
the
only
justification
that
was
given
in
the
louisiana
court
was
the
idea
that
illegitimacy
would
be
deterred
by
rule
of
this
kind.
not
only
was
this
assertion
unsupported
by
factual
data
but
with
all
candor,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
wholly
unbelievable
assertion.
it
assumes
that
those
in
the
process
of
begetting
children
will
assume
all
of
the
following
eventualities.
the
possibility
of
pregnancy
that
there
will
be
no
later
marriage
or
other
method
of
legitimating
the
children
that
the
children
will
not
be
acknowledged,
that
the
mother
would
subsequently
die
at
the
hands
of
a
tortfeasor,
not
only
of
a
tortfeasor
but
in
the
hands
of
a
solvent
or
insured
tortfeasor
and
not
only
that
but
within
the
jurisdiction
of
louisiana.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
here
that
the
people
on
whose
behalf
the
lawsuit
is
being
brought
are
the
innocent
children
of
this
woman.
they
have
had
no
and
could
have
had
no
control
over
to
their
status.
so
we
have
here
innocent
children,
no
control
over
their
status,
a
wrong
doer,
avoiding
the
consequences
of
his
act
and
not
only
that,
despite
with
all
respect,
the
assertions
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee,
louisiana
is
the
only
jurisdiction
at
the
present
time
that
would
have
this
result.
four
other
states
are
mentioned
as
possibly
reaching
the
same
result
under
existing
law
new
jersey,
pennsylvania,
indiana
and
new
york.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
goes
--
that's
the
inheritance
part.
every
state
in
the
united
states
at
the
present
time
would
permit
an
illegitimate
child
to
recover
inheritance
from
the
mother
and
there
was
a
factual
error
in
our
brief.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it's
under
one
statute
but
there
are
two
elements
of
the
statute
and
two
elements
of
damages.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
it
does.
in
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
correct
an
assertion
in
our
brief.
we
say
that
new
york
also
would
have
denied
recovery
of
inheritance
but
there
was
a
new
york
statute
that
came
into
effect
in
september
1967
which
amended
the
new
york
law
but
that
has
not
come
to
our
attention
when
we
were
drafting
this
brief.
it's
on
page
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
do.
it's
section
5
-
3.4
of
the
state's
powers
and
trust
laws,
and
the
new
york
statute
amends
the
earlier
law
by
saying
under
the
title
"inheritance
by
or
from
illegitimate
persons".
for
the
purposes
of
this
article,
an
illegitimate
child
is
the
legitimate
child
of
his
mother
and
he
in
this
issue
inherits
from
his
mother
and
from
her
kindred.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
was
passed
in
1966
session,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
there
is
one
other
element
in
this
case
that
of
course
underlies
the
first
claim
in
point
of
pagination
and
that
is,
we
have
here
a
minority,
a
minority
that
in
the
words
of
justice
stone
and
his
famous
footnote
for
carolene
products
is
a
discrete
and
insular
minority.
it's
a
minority
that
has
characteristics
similar
to
the
racial
classifications
that
this
court
of
course
has
been
dealing
with
for
so
many
years.
we
have
here
a
minority
that
has
been
the
subject
of
prejudice
and
abuse.
this
prejudice,
moreover,
is
motivated
by
complex,
historical,
psychological
and
sociological
factors.
in
the
words
of
one
psychiatrist
who
made
an
extensive
study
of
illegitimacy
quoted
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
persons,
"illegitimacy
is
a
psychic
catastrophe,
not
only
as
of
the
psychic
catastrophe,
not
only
is
it
a
believed
minority
but
a
discrimination
against
the
people
in
the
category
of
illegitimacy
stems
from
a
condition
of
birth
unrelated
to
individual
capacities,
uncontrollable
by
the
individuals
themselves."
indeed,
in
one
respect,
one
can
even
assert
that
this
is
an
a
fortiori
case
for
race.
because
unlike
the
situation
of
minority
racial
groups,
there
is
no
lobby
for
the
illegitimate
and
in
the
footnote
4
in
carolene
products
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
that
particular
care
must
be
had
in
scrutinizing
statutes
where
the
ordinary
political
processes
are
unable
to
work.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
such
a
case
and
that
these
people
are
in
the
category
analogous
to
the
racial
minorities.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
there
are,
mr.
justice
stewart
or
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
are
several
types
and
the
main
one
of
course
involves
inheritance,
straight
inheritance
from
the
mother,
from
the
father
and
from
collateral
relatives
of
both.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
--
with
respect
to
the
mother
--
with
respect
to
the
mother
but
with
respect
to
the
father,
the
law
is
more
complicated.
16
states
by
statute
have
provided
that
illegitimates
can
recover.
if
it
does
not,
we
will
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
mr.
justice
fortas.
one
state
has
done
it
by
judicial
decision,
connecticut.
10
states
have
denied
inheritance
from
the
father
by
statute.
some
have
given
limited
rights
and
some
are
silent.so
we
have
five
categories
of
states
with
respect
to
inheritance
from
the
father.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
addition
of
course,
there
are
special
rules
relating
to
support.
there
are
special
rules
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
wills
where
the
word
"children"
is
used
and
adorned
by
any
explicating
adjective.
mr.
norman
dorsen
my
understanding
is
that
everywhere
that
they
are
inheritable
of
putting
apart
in
this
factor
of
illegitimacy.
the
common
law
was
that
it
was
not
lord
campbell's
act
in
england
in
1846
was
the
first
statute.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
is
inherited.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
correct
in
1846.
every
state
in
united
states
now
has
a
wrongful
death
act
and
the
purposes
of
these
acts
of
course
were
patterned
after
the
original
english
law.
our
position
of
course
is
as
we
develop
more
fully
in
the
brief
that
the
criteria
in
itself
is
arbitrary
that
the
factors
which
underlie
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
with
respect
to
other
invidious
classifications
do
apply
in
this
case
and
therefore,
our
submission
to
this
court
is
double
barreled.
one,
that
the
denial
of
the
right
to
sue
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
louisiana's
own
statute
and
secondly
that
it's
on
the
basis
of
a
criteria
in
which
itself
a
suspect
and
must
be
scrutinized
carefully.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'd
be
happy
to
do
that.
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
do
have
a
summary
of
that
but
i
will
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum.
i
shall
be
very
brief
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
that
it's
not
true
that
the
brief
of
the
appellant
says
that
this
is
a
racist
statute.
that
is
not
found
in
our
brief
and
we
are
not
asserting
it
to
this
court.
now,
mr.
porteous
did
mention
several
aspects
of
louisiana
property
law.
i
think
it's
worth
pointing
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
very
recent
article
in
the
tulane
law
review
that
was
published
within
the
last
few
months
on
this
problem.
it's
28
--
it's
the
louisiana
law
review,
28
louisiana
law
review
110
just
published
on
page
123,
the
writer
of
the
comment
states,
"the
discrimination
in
our
inheritance
law
seems
no
longer
justifiable
on
any
rational
basis."
this
is
the
discrimination
against
illegitimates.
and
in
case
one
is
led
to
think
that
this
is
a
newfangled
idea,
i
would
like
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
an
1851
louisiana
case
which
of
course
was
decided
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
which
the
court
in
dupre
v.
carruthers
(ph)
also
cited
in
louisiana
law
review
set
in
language
that's
rather
more
graphic
than
i
am
capable
of
formulating,
"it
is
true
that
the
legislation
has
ever
failed
in
this
object
to
honor
matrimony
and
discourage
concubinage
for
probably
no
one
was
ever
deterred
from
concubinage
by
the
consideration
that
his
innocent
offspring
would
be
the
victim
of
his
guilt
and
the
only
effect
has
been
that
the
guilty
parents
have
eaten
the
grapes
while
the
child's
teeth
with
tears
in
his
eyes
had
been
set
on
the
edge."
and
that's
from
louisiana
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
was
dupre
v.
carruthers
(ph)
6
louisiana
annotation
156.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
because
it
isn't
--
it's
in
the
article
in
28
louisiana
law
review.
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
think
that
there
are
perfectly
reasonable
grounds
for
distinguishing
that
situation
from
this
situation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
true.
but
first
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
apply
this
rule
because
the
ground
of
the
distinction
would
not
be
on
the
basis
of
illegitimacy
which
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
true.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
person
can
become
a
citizen
in
most
situations.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it
might
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
between
an
alien
and
illegitimate
among
other
things
is
that
the
illegitimate
can
never
change
a
status.
the
status
is
determined
by
the
complex
of
very
subtle
factors
which
had
been
elaborated
at
some
length
by
authorities
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae.
i
would
not
think
that
the
situation
of
the
alien
and
the
situation
of
the
illegitimate
is
fairly
comparable
though
i
would
concede
that
the
distinction
you
make
on
that
narrow
point
is
a
valid
one.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
have
seen
no
substantial
authority
in
the
louisiana
courts
to
that
effect.
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
such
a
policy
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
next
thing
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
the
lower
court
did
not
attempt
to
justify
on
that
ground
and
in
any
event,
that
is
not
this
case.
this
is
a
wrongful
death
action
which
involves
considerations
that
are
somewhat
distinct
from
any
of
the
property
consideration.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
quite
true
but
the
purpose
of
this
particular
survivorship
statute
does
have
the
element
of
deterring
toward
feasorship
i
think
the
only
argument
that
mr.
porteous
made
that
seemed
to
me
the
solidly
base
in
terms
of
possibly
persuading
this
court
was
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
case.
and
if
that
is
the
ground
that
he
set
at
one
point
that
he
is
prepared
to
stand
on,
i
would
say
that
logically,
that
would
be
a
ground
that
would
cover
the
issue.
but
apart
from
that
when
one
turns
especially
to
the
particular
situation
that
we're
confronted
with
here,
i
see
no
basis
at
all
for
validating
statute.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
am
not
conceding
that
point.
i'm
not
mr.
justice.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
norman
dorsen
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
a
state
can
deny
children
born
to
an
unmarried
woman
the
benefits
of
a
statute
permitting
children
generally
to
sue
for
the
wrongful
death
of
their
mother.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple
and
uncontested.
the
decedent,
mrs.
louise
levy
was
the
mother
of
five
infant
children
whose
interests
are
at
stake
here.
the
children
lived
with
their
mother
and
were
dependent
on
her.
the
defendants
in
the
case
in
this
court
are
dr.
w.j.
wing
of
the
charity
hospital
of
new
orleans
and
an
insurance
company,
the
interstate
fire
&
casualty
company.
on
march
12,
1964,
mrs.
levy
went
to
the
charity
hospital
feeling
ill
and
having
other
symptoms.
she
was
assigned
to
dr.
wing
who
purported
to
examine
here
but
failed
to
take
blood
test
and
make
other
checks.
on
march
19,
mrs.
levy
returned
and
she
was
still
feeling
ill.
dr.
wing
admonished
her
for
not
taking
the
medicine
that
he
had
prescribed
and
he
suggested
that
she
see
a
psychiatrist
and
in
fact,
he
made
an
appointment
with
her
to
see
a
psychiatrist.
on
march
22nd,
mrs.
levy
was
brought
to
the
hospital
in
a
comatose
condition,
on
march
29th,
she
died.
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
louisiana
courts
under
article
2315
of
the
louisiana
code,
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
the
state.
two
elements
of
damages
were
alleged,
totalling
$60,000.00.
$55,000.00
was
alleged
as
the
damages
that
these
children
suffered
for
the
loss
of
their
mother
prior
to
the
age
of
majority.
this
is
the
wrongful
death
element.
$5,000.00
was
alleged
as
the
survivorship
portion
of
the
damages
for
the
decedent's
pain
and
suffering
before
she
died.
after
procedural
matters
were
taken
care
of
in
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
cause
of
action.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
louisiana
and
one
reason
was
given
for
denying
these
illegitimate
children
the
right
to
sue
and
the
words
of
the
louisiana
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
is
"actually
based
on
morals
and
general
welfare
because
it
discourages
bringing
children
into
the
world
out
of
wedlock".
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
did
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
the
supreme
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
correct.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
without
opinion
refused
the
writ
of
error.
it's
the
position
in
this
court
that
the
appellants
take
that
this
application
of
article
2315
is
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
because
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
denying
the
children
rights
on
the
basis
of
suspect
criteria,
the
status
of
illegitimacy.
second,
because
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
on
the
ground
of
a
statutory
classification
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
article
2315.
and
three,
that
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
discrimination
for
there
is
no
valid
state
purpose
and
deprives
the
children
of
rights
on
the
basis
of
a
status
over
which
they
have
no
control.
our
first
point
is
that
the
classification
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
statutory
purpose.
the
principle
in
this
court
is
ancient
and
clear
and
we
quoted
in
the
brief
on
page
9
where
the
court
said
as
long
ago
as
1896
that
the
attempted
classification
must
always
rest
upon
some
difference
which
bears
a
reasonable
and
just
relation
to
the
act
in
respect
to
which
the
classification
is
proposed
and
can
never
be
made
arbitrarily
and
without
any
such
basis.
of
course
more
recent
cases
like
carrington
and
rash
and
mclaughlin
and
florida
adopt
and
apply
this
rule
of
the
court.
the
application
of
this
principle,
it
seems
to
us
is
equally
plain
in
this
case.
it's
the
purpose
of
the
wrongful
death
portion
of
the
statute
to
save
children
harmless
from
the
loss
of
the
material
and
moral
benefits
that
they
would
have
received
if
their
mother
had
lived,
the
mother
in
whom
they
were
dependent,
the
mother
with
whom
they
resided
and
this
of
course
is
the
purpose
of
all
wrongful
death
statutes.
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
it's
wholly
unreasonable
to
discriminate
against
the
illegitimate
children.
they
were
as
close
to
their
mother
as
any
children
could
be.
they
were
fully
dependent
on
her
for
both
the
economic
necessities
and
the
intangibles
of
training,
nurture
and
guidance.
indeed
louisiana
workman's
compensation
law
which
has
been
applied
to
permit
dependence
to
recover
under
the
workman's
compensation
law
even
if
they're
illegitimate,
points
up
in
our
judgement
the
unreasonable
nature
of
the
classification
here.
when
one
turns
to
the
survivorship
portion
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
is
only
slightly
different
but
there
is
an
added
element
and
that
is
to
reinforce
the
deterrent
aspects
of
the
general
tort
law
by
refusing
to
permit
wrongdoers
to
escape
payment.
this
stated
in
the
statute
itself
and
by
an
authoritative
law
review
article
in
louisiana
which
on
page
16
states,
"the
idea
apparently
evolved
that
the
person
responsible
for
the
wrongful
act
should
pay
damages
to
someone
connected
with
the
deceased
whether
or
not
that
person
was
dependent
on
him.
and
of
course
in
this
case,
the
children
were
dependent
on
the
mother
and
there
is
no
reason
that
i
can
think
of
and
no
reason
has
been
suggested,
i
respectfully
say
to
the
court,
why
this
children
like
any
other
children
should
not
be
able
to
bring
this
course
of
action
on
behalf
of
their
--
in
their
status
as
dependents
and
children
of
the
mother
with
whom
they
lived.
now,
the
justification,
the
only
justification
that
was
given
in
the
louisiana
court
was
the
idea
that
illegitimacy
would
be
deterred
by
rule
of
this
kind.
not
only
was
this
assertion
unsupported
by
factual
data
but
with
all
candor,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
wholly
unbelievable
assertion.
it
assumes
that
those
in
the
process
of
begetting
children
will
assume
all
of
the
following
eventualities.
the
possibility
of
pregnancy
that
there
will
be
no
later
marriage
or
other
method
of
legitimating
the
children
that
the
children
will
not
be
acknowledged,
that
the
mother
would
subsequently
die
at
the
hands
of
a
tortfeasor,
not
only
of
a
tortfeasor
but
in
the
hands
of
a
solvent
or
insured
tortfeasor
and
not
only
that
but
within
the
jurisdiction
of
louisiana.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
here
that
the
people
on
whose
behalf
the
lawsuit
is
being
brought
are
the
innocent
children
of
this
woman.
they
have
had
no
and
could
have
had
no
control
over
to
their
status.
so
we
have
here
innocent
children,
no
control
over
their
status,
a
wrong
doer,
avoiding
the
consequences
of
his
act
and
not
only
that,
despite
with
all
respect,
the
assertions
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee,
louisiana
is
the
only
jurisdiction
at
the
present
time
that
would
have
this
result.
four
other
states
are
mentioned
as
possibly
reaching
the
same
result
under
existing
law
new
jersey,
pennsylvania,
indiana
and
new
york.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
goes
--
that's
the
inheritance
part.
every
state
in
the
united
states
at
the
present
time
would
permit
an
illegitimate
child
to
recover
inheritance
from
the
mother
and
there
was
a
factual
error
in
our
brief.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it's
under
one
statute
but
there
are
two
elements
of
the
statute
and
two
elements
of
damages.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
it
does.
in
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
correct
an
assertion
in
our
brief.
we
say
that
new
york
also
would
have
denied
recovery
of
inheritance
but
there
was
a
new
york
statute
that
came
into
effect
in
september
1967
which
amended
the
new
york
law
but
that
has
not
come
to
our
attention
when
we
were
drafting
this
brief.
it's
on
page
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
do.
it's
section
5
-
3.4
of
the
state's
powers
and
trust
laws,
and
the
new
york
statute
amends
the
earlier
law
by
saying
under
the
title
"inheritance
by
or
from
illegitimate
persons".
for
the
purposes
of
this
article,
an
illegitimate
child
is
the
legitimate
child
of
his
mother
and
he
in
this
issue
inherits
from
his
mother
and
from
her
kindred.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
was
passed
in
1966
session,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
there
is
one
other
element
in
this
case
that
of
course
underlies
the
first
claim
in
point
of
pagination
and
that
is,
we
have
here
a
minority,
a
minority
that
in
the
words
of
justice
stone
and
his
famous
footnote
for
carolene
products
is
a
discrete
and
insular
minority.
it's
a
minority
that
has
characteristics
similar
to
the
racial
classifications
that
this
court
of
course
has
been
dealing
with
for
so
many
years.
we
have
here
a
minority
that
has
been
the
subject
of
prejudice
and
abuse.
this
prejudice,
moreover,
is
motivated
by
complex,
historical,
psychological
and
sociological
factors.
in
the
words
of
one
psychiatrist
who
made
an
extensive
study
of
illegitimacy
quoted
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
persons,
"illegitimacy
is
a
psychic
catastrophe,
not
only
as
of
the
psychic
catastrophe,
not
only
is
it
a
believed
minority
but
a
discrimination
against
the
people
in
the
category
of
illegitimacy
stems
from
a
condition
of
birth
unrelated
to
individual
capacities,
uncontrollable
by
the
individuals
themselves."
indeed,
in
one
respect,
one
can
even
assert
that
this
is
an
a
fortiori
case
for
race.
because
unlike
the
situation
of
minority
racial
groups,
there
is
no
lobby
for
the
illegitimate
and
in
the
footnote
4
in
carolene
products
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
that
particular
care
must
be
had
in
scrutinizing
statutes
where
the
ordinary
political
processes
are
unable
to
work.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
such
a
case
and
that
these
people
are
in
the
category
analogous
to
the
racial
minorities.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
there
are,
mr.
justice
stewart
or
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
are
several
types
and
the
main
one
of
course
involves
inheritance,
straight
inheritance
from
the
mother,
from
the
father
and
from
collateral
relatives
of
both.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
--
with
respect
to
the
mother
--
with
respect
to
the
mother
but
with
respect
to
the
father,
the
law
is
more
complicated.
16
states
by
statute
have
provided
that
illegitimates
can
recover.
if
it
does
not,
we
will
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
mr.
justice
fortas.
one
state
has
done
it
by
judicial
decision,
connecticut.
10
states
have
denied
inheritance
from
the
father
by
statute.
some
have
given
limited
rights
and
some
are
silent.so
we
have
five
categories
of
states
with
respect
to
inheritance
from
the
father.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
addition
of
course,
there
are
special
rules
relating
to
support.
there
are
special
rules
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
wills
where
the
word
"children"
is
used
and
adorned
by
any
explicating
adjective.
mr.
norman
dorsen
my
understanding
is
that
everywhere
that
they
are
inheritable
of
putting
apart
in
this
factor
of
illegitimacy.
the
common
law
was
that
it
was
not
lord
campbell's
act
in
england
in
1846
was
the
first
statute.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
is
inherited.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
correct
in
1846.
every
state
in
united
states
now
has
a
wrongful
death
act
and
the
purposes
of
these
acts
of
course
were
patterned
after
the
original
english
law.
our
position
of
course
is
as
we
develop
more
fully
in
the
brief
that
the
criteria
in
itself
is
arbitrary
that
the
factors
which
underlie
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
with
respect
to
other
invidious
classifications
do
apply
in
this
case
and
therefore,
our
submission
to
this
court
is
double
barreled.
one,
that
the
denial
of
the
right
to
sue
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
louisiana's
own
statute
and
secondly
that
it's
on
the
basis
of
a
criteria
in
which
itself
a
suspect
and
must
be
scrutinized
carefully.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'd
be
happy
to
do
that.
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
do
have
a
summary
of
that
but
i
will
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum.
i
shall
be
very
brief
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
that
it's
not
true
that
the
brief
of
the
appellant
says
that
this
is
a
racist
statute.
that
is
not
found
in
our
brief
and
we
are
not
asserting
it
to
this
court.
now,
mr.
porteous
did
mention
several
aspects
of
louisiana
property
law.
i
think
it's
worth
pointing
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
very
recent
article
in
the
tulane
law
review
that
was
published
within
the
last
few
months
on
this
problem.
it's
28
--
it's
the
louisiana
law
review,
28
louisiana
law
review
110
just
published
on
page
123,
the
writer
of
the
comment
states,
"the
discrimination
in
our
inheritance
law
seems
no
longer
justifiable
on
any
rational
basis."
this
is
the
discrimination
against
illegitimates.
and
in
case
one
is
led
to
think
that
this
is
a
newfangled
idea,
i
would
like
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
an
1851
louisiana
case
which
of
course
was
decided
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
which
the
court
in
dupre
v.
carruthers
(ph)
also
cited
in
louisiana
law
review
set
in
language
that's
rather
more
graphic
than
i
am
capable
of
formulating,
"it
is
true
that
the
legislation
has
ever
failed
in
this
object
to
honor
matrimony
and
discourage
concubinage
for
probably
no
one
was
ever
deterred
from
concubinage
by
the
consideration
that
his
innocent
offspring
would
be
the
victim
of
his
guilt
and
the
only
effect
has
been
that
the
guilty
parents
have
eaten
the
grapes
while
the
child's
teeth
with
tears
in
his
eyes
had
been
set
on
the
edge."
and
that's
from
louisiana
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
was
dupre
v.
carruthers
(ph)
6
louisiana
annotation
156.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
because
it
isn't
--
it's
in
the
article
in
28
louisiana
law
review.
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
think
that
there
are
perfectly
reasonable
grounds
for
distinguishing
that
situation
from
this
situation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
true.
but
first
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
apply
this
rule
because
the
ground
of
the
distinction
would
not
be
on
the
basis
of
illegitimacy
which
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
quite
true.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
person
can
become
a
citizen
in
most
situations.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it
might
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
between
an
alien
and
illegitimate
among
other
things
is
that
the
illegitimate
can
never
change
a
status.
the
status
is
determined
by
the
complex
of
very
subtle
factors
which
had
been
elaborated
at
some
length
by
authorities
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae.
i
would
not
think
that
the
situation
of
the
alien
and
the
situation
of
the
illegitimate
is
fairly
comparable
though
i
would
concede
that
the
distinction
you
make
on
that
narrow
point
is
a
valid
one.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
have
seen
no
substantial
authority
in
the
louisiana
courts
to
that
effect.
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
such
a
policy
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
next
thing
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
the
lower
court
did
not
attempt
to
justify
on
that
ground
and
in
any
event,
that
is
not
this
case.
this
is
a
wrongful
death
action
which
involves
considerations
that
are
somewhat
distinct
from
any
of
the
property
consideration.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
quite
true
but
the
purpose
of
this
particular
survivorship
statute
does
have
the
element
of
deterring
toward
feasorship
i
think
the
only
argument
that
mr.
porteous
made
that
seemed
to
me
the
solidly
base
in
terms
of
possibly
persuading
this
court
was
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
case.
and
if
that
is
the
ground
that
he
set
at
one
point
that
he
is
prepared
to
stand
on,
i
would
say
that
logically,
that
would
be
a
ground
that
would
cover
the
issue.
but
apart
from
that
when
one
turns
especially
to
the
particular
situation
that
we're
confronted
with
here,
i
see
no
basis
at
all
for
validating
statute.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
am
not
conceding
that
point.
i'm
not
mr.
justice.
thank
you
very
much.
