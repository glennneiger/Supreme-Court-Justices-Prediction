justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
i
misunderstand
you
then
mr.
porteous?
i
thought
you're
also
suggesting
that
this
kind
of
rule
is
in
the
interest
of
enforcement
of
the
state
policy
or
forced
heirship
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
which
is
it?
if
it
were
that,
i
would
think
you
couldn't
answer
mr.
justice
white
that
there
could
be
a
distinction
drawn
between
illegitimates
over
20
and
the
illegitimate
under
20.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which
is
it?
is
this
in
the
interest
of
--
oh
gosh
what's
the
word,
morality
or
something
like
that
or
is
it
in
the
interest
of
the
state
policy
of
forced
heirship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
forced
heirship?
is
that
something
which
comes
from
--
i
gather
that
you're
suggesting
from
a
continental
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
that
and
i
don't
think
it
goes
quite
that
far
but
certainly
in
my
own
state,
one
can't
for
example
disinherit
his
wife.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
laws
require
that
it
will
be
a
minimal
portion
that
she
must
to
see
--
most
states
have
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
similar
rule
in
these
other
states
which
don't
go
as
far
as
you
do
in
other
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
mr.
porteous
argument?
really,
this
is
in
the
service
of
the
policy
enforcement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anyway,
that's
not
the
ground
on
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
also
have
the
heirship
purpose
here.
