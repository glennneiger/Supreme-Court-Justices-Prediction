this

justice

but
how
about
--
how
about
the
--
this
is
the
two
pronged
action
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
statement
that
there
is
only
one
state
in
united
states
wouldn't
refuse
this
claim
that
goes
to
both
elements.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
that
statute.
justice

what
perhaps
your

(inaudible)
justice

i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we've
examined
the
french
law
at
--
it
was
the
basis
for
louisiana's
law
and
that
law
itself
suffered
considerable
permutations
over
time
but
louisiana
is
one
of
the
states
and
that
it
would
be
subject
to
the
constitution
and
although
it
has
a
particular
historical
oddity
just
as
california
and
new
mexico
law
is
derived
from
the
spanish
law,
i
would
not
think
that
would
be
directly
relevant
to
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
louisiana
feels
that
this
sort
of
a
rule
is
a
deterrent
to
certain
kinds
of
conduct,
i
would
suppose
that
it
might
not
legitimatize
so
easily
but
i
gather
it's
not
difficult
at
all,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
reason
--
if
the
reason
is
you
don't
recognize
the
illegitimates
right
in
this
case
is
because
of
some
possible
impact
on
the
conduct
of
other
parents.
i'm
not
sure
it
has
much
a
cut
if
the
person
knows
that
automatically,
you
can
legitimatize
your
illegitimate
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
the
state
--
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
the
statute
other
than,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying
that
this
is
in
the
family
law
area
and
that
this
is
just
not
the
kind
of
an
area
that
the
equal
protection
clause
even
know
how
to
apply
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you're
suggesting
and
i
would
suppose
that
you
would
suggest
that
if
louisiana
passes
the
statute
and
said
all
the
illegitimate
children
over
20
may
inherit
and
all
the
illegitimate
children
under
20
may
not
that
the
equal
protection
clause
just
wouldn't
reach
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unless
you
hold,
unless
you
go
that
far
and
rule
on
that
basis,
they're
just
--
there
isn't
much
room
for
upholding
or
finding
any
rational
basis
for
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
--
that's
your
--
that's
what
you
stand
on.
justice
byron

white
how
--
what
arrangements
in
louisiana
do
you
have
this
according
to
birth.
justice
byron

do
you
think
normally
is
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
legitimate
or
illegitimate
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
there
any
real
problem
in
louisiana
knowing
whose
mother
a
child
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dorsen,
what
about
state
regulations
that
aliens
can't
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
can't
really
help
--
if
louisiana
permitted,
that's
to
say
that
louisiana
permitted
people
18
years
old
to
vote
and
--
but
said
only
citizens
can
vote.
could
the
child
do
anything
at
all
about
its
alien
status?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
be
helpless,
absolutely
helpless.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
apply
this
rule,
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
be
to
alienate
your
status.
justice

about

nobody
can

anything.
