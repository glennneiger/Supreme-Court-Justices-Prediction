justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
your
posi
--
is
it
your
position
that
there
was
no
claim
here
because
the
farmer
did
not
have
a
right
to
get
the
loan?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
farmer,
under
the
statute,
had
some
thought
of
a
right,
didn't
he?
that
is
to
say
the
statute
authorized
the
making
of
these
loans,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
is
it
your
position
that
that
was
totally
discretionary?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
the
act
--
doesn't
the
act
authorize
the
commodity
credit
corporation
to
make
loans
to
the
farmer's
needing
storage
facilities,
when
the
growers
shall
apply?
do
you
construe
that
as
totally
discretionary?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
you
don't
challenge
--
if
you
assume
that
we
get
over
that
hurdle,
if
the
court
gets
over
that
hurdle,
you
don't
make
any
point
about
the
culpability
or
the
involvement
of
neifort-white
under
3490,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
your
sole
point
here,
as
i
understand,
is
that
since
the
commodity
credit
corporation
had
discretion
to
make
or
not
to
make
the
loan,
therefore
it's
not
a
claim
under
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
farmer
went
to
an
appropriate
agency
within
the
commodity
credit
corporation
and
said
“will
you
lend
me
money
to
buy
a
grain
storage
bin
or
whatever
it
is?”
and
the
commodity
credit
corporation
said
“yes.
upon
presentation
of
an
invoice,
we'll
lend
you
the
money.”
and
then,
neifert-white
gave
him
this
presumptively
false
invoice.
what
about
that?
could
neifert-white
be
pros
--
be
sued
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question
because
the
problem
here
is,
on
your
theory,
is
whether
this
is
really
totally
nothing
more
than
an
application
for
the
favorable
exercise
of
government
discretion
or
whether
there
is
something
resembling
a
legal
right.
if
the
government
--
if
the
commodity
credit
corporation
said,
“yes,
mr.
farmer,
you
may
have
the
loan
upon
presentation
of
an
invoice.”
and
if
he
had
come
in
with
a
proper
invoice
and
no
question
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
loan,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
here,
you
came
--
what
happened
here
is
--
the
only
thing
that
happened
here
is,
as
i
said,
is
that
came
--
the
farmer
came
in
with
a
fraudulent
invoice.
justice
abe
fortas
i
believe
so.
