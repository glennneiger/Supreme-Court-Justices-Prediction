has
there
ever
been
an
effort,
mr.
martin,
to
get
legislative
amendments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather
though,
the
issue
has
been
lying
around
for
quite
a
while
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
been
assumed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

along
what
application
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
the
identical
facts
that
we
have
here
upon
which
that
prosecution
rested,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
is
it
in
the
element
under
the
false
claims
act
that
the
government
in
fact
loses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
even
though
the
government
--
as
happened
here,
i
gather,
the
loans
were
fully
repaid,
nevertheless
if
it
was
--
if
the
application
was
a
false
claim,
there'd
still
be
liability
under
the
statute,
would
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
only
be
gross
in
aptitude
on
the
part
of
the
asc
officials,
it
seems
to
me,
and
that's
the
local
committee
who
handles
loans
because
they
have
the
discretion.
they
have
all
these
protections
for
security.
justice
william
j.

for
the
farmer

neifert-white,
your
honor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
let's
see.
that
is
if
the
item
was
actually
sold
to
the
grower
at
$100.
it
was
invoiced
for
the
purpose
of
the
loan,
say,
at
$200.
is
that
it?
whatever
the
figures
are,
is
that
the
way
the
thing
worked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.

william

is
--
i

is
this
the
way
it
worked?
justice
william

brennan,

that,
in

the
grower
was
charged
by
neifert-white,

$50

$38,
whatever
it
may
be,

they
were
