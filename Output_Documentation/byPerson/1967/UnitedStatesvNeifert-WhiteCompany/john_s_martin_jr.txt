mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
affirming
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
montana,
which
dismissed
the
complaint
in
the
government's
action
under
the
civil
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
against
the
respondent,
neifert-white
company.
respondent
is
a
corporation
which
acts
as
a
dealer
in
grain
storage
bins.
the
complaint
in
this
action
charged
or
alleged
that,
on
12
separate
occasions
in
1959,
respondent
engaged
and
made
sales
to
various
individuals.
these
sales
were
financed
by
loans
obtained
from
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
according
to
the
applicable
regulations
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
the
corporation
was
authorized
to
issue
loans
on
storage
facilities
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
80%
of
the
purchase
price
of
that
facility.
the
complaint
in
this
action
alleged
that,
in
each
of
the
12
instances
referred
to,
the
respondent
submitted
to
the
commodity
credit
corporations
false
invoices
which
fraudulently
stated
and
inflated
the
purchase
price
of
the
bins
in
question.
the
result
of
this
fraud
being
that,
in
each
of
the
12
instances,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
was
caused
to
issue
loans
which
were,
in
fact,
in
access
of
80%
of
the
purchase
price
that
was
actually
paid
by
the
purchases.
in
dismissing
the
complaint
in
this
action,
the
--
and
in
affirming
that
dismissal,
the
court
below
ruled
that
a
loan
application
is
not
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
therefore,
the
only
and
the
sole
issue
presented
by
this
case
with
this
court's
decision
is
whether
or
not
a
loan
application
is
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
is
and
that
the
court
below
was
in
error
in
narrowly
construing
the
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act.
the
relevant
statutory
language
appears
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
and,
without
reading
all
of
that
language,
further
court--
the
key
language
in
this
statute
which
is
of
concern
here
is
that
the
statute
applies
to
any
claim
upon
or
against
the
government.
the
government's
position
that
that
language
means
--
what
the
court
referred
to
--
this
court
referred
to
in
united
states
v.
mcninch
when
it
said
that
the
conception
of
a
claim
against
the
government,
and
this
language
appears
at
page
10
in
our
brief,
the
court
said,
“the
conception
of
a
claim
against
the
government
normally
connotes
a
demand
for
money
over
some
transfer
of
property.”
that
is
the
test
which
we
submit
should
be
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
claim
against
the
government.
is
the
applicant
seeking
the
payment
of
government
funds
for
the
transfer
of
government
property?
we
think
that
the
construction
that
we
urge
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose
in
enacting
the
false
claims
act
that
it
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
in
line
with
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
and,
in
addition,
that
the
standard
set
down
by
the
court
below,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
assertion
of
a
legal
right,
is
not
a
meaningful
standard
which
can
be
clearly
applied
by
either
the
justice
department
or
the
courts
below.
looking
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
the
courts
--
this
is
the
first
case
to
come
before
this
court
and
also
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
loan
is
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act
has
been
expressly
considered
by
the
courts.
it
has,
in
a
number
of
cases,
three
cases
appear
in
--
that
came
before
this
court,
united
states
v.
rainwater,
united
states
v.
cato,
and
united
states
v.
toepleman
were
here
before
this
court
and
the
issue
raised
in
those
cases
was
whether
the
commodity
credit
corporation
was
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
implicit
in
the
holding
that
sustained
an
action
under
the
false
claims
act
against
those
defendants
was
that
a
loan
is
a
claim.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
not,
mr.
justice
white,
except
--
with
this
exception,
that
the
word
--
the
meaning
of
the
word
“claim”
was
argued
in
a
slightly
different
context
in
a
companion
case.
you
had
cato
and
toepleman
were
decided
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
v.
mcninch.
mcninch
involved
an
application
for
credit
insurance.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
court
did
not
expressly
deal
with
that
question,
mr.
justice
white.
it
did,
as
i
just
quoted
in
the
court's
language
in
mcninch,
and
i
think
important
in
that
is
what
mr.
justice
black
writing
for
the
court
said
in
that
case.
he
said
that,
in
dealing
with
mcninch
which
was
the
case
involving
an
application
for
credit
insurance
and
the
government
was
arguing
that
case
that
the
application
for
credit
insurance
was
a
claim.
and,
mr.
justice
black,
speaking
for
the
court
in
that
case,
said
that,
normally,
the
term
“claim,”
this
language
is
again
in
our
brief
at
page
10,
he
recognized
that,
literally,
the
term
“claim”
could
be
considered
to
cover
and
i
am
quoting
the
assertion
of
“a
right
or
privilege
to
draw
upon
the
government's
credit.”
so,
he
recognized
in
that
case
that
the
term
“claim”
could
have
that
reached
under
literal
application,
but
he
said
in
mcninch
that
the
problem
was
that
there
was
no
demand
for
immediate
transfer
of
government
funds
or
government
property.
and,
the
court
said
in
a
footnote
in
the
mcninch
opinion
that
we
will
leave
to
another
day
the
question
of
what
happens
when
there
has
been
a
default
on
the
loan
the
government
is
required
to
payout,
whether
that,
in
that
context,
becomes
a
claim.
so
that,
the
--
i
do
think
that
these
cases
have
some
value
because
the
question
of
what
was
a
claim
was
at
issue,
although
in
a
different
context,
and
no
one
ever
dispute
it,
either
the
attorneys
or
the
court,
that
an
application
for
a
loan
was
a
claim.
we
think
that
the
construction
that
we
urge
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose.
the
court
made
clear
in
mcninch
and
it
had
said
in
us
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
that
a
claim--
that
the
purpose
of
the
false
claims
act
was
to
protect
the
public
treasury.
certainly,
in
the
type
with
as
many
government
loan
programs
that
we
have
today,
this
is
an
important
method
in
which
the
public
treasury
can
be
depleted
by
fraudulent
loan
applications.
just
to
point
out
the
statistics
in
the
commodity
credit
corporation
alone,
that
last
year
they
issued
approximately
$1.4
billion
with
loans
on
crops.
the
grains
--
the
storage
facility
program
resulted
in
the
issuance
of
approximately
$15
million
worth
of
loans.
these
are
only
two
of
the
government's
loan
programs
and,
we
submit,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
that
these
government
loan
funds
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
false
claims
act.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
counsel
has
stated
in
his
brief
that
the
government
does
not
need
the
protection
of
the
false
claims
act
because
it
--
civil
provisions
because
it
does
have
the
criminal
provisions
of
section
1001
of
title
18,
and
that
any
false
claim
in
a
loan
application
for
a
statement
of
loan
application
would
be
covered
by
that.
however,
i
do
think
the
statutory
framework
sets
up
a
range
of
possible
alternative
action
the
government
could
take.
criminal
action
is
one,
but
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
there
may
be
false
statements
contained
in
loan
applications
or
other
types
of
claims
where
it's
a
single
instance,
it's
relatively
minor,
where
perhaps
the
invocation
of
criminal
sanctions
is
too
severe.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
provide
the
government
with
a
reasonable
alternative
way
of
proceeding
in
that
type
of
case,
and
so
that
this
does
perform
a
fairly
substantial
function.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
this
is
the
first
--
as
i
say,
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
issue
has
come
up.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
it's
never
been
raised.
i
don't
think
that
it's
ever
been
thought
of
until
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
has
been
assumed
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
take
it,
a
loan
application
was
a
claim.
it
was
assumed
in
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
now,
as
i
stated,
we
think
that
our
reading
of
the
statute
comports
with
the
intent
of
congress.
we
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
which
deci
--
the
cases
decided
by
this
court.
we
also
think
that
the
rule
which
the
court
below
laid
down
is
really
not
a
meaningful
test.
to
say
that
the
false
claims
act
will
apply
where
there
is
an
assertion
of
a
legal
right
leads
to
the
question
what
does
that
mean
in
the
context
of
this
case?
these
applications
--
these
loan
applications
were
submitted
under
what
we
conceded
below.
i
want
to
privies
my
remarks
by
saying
we
conceded
below
the
person
making
a
loan
application
could
not
go
into
court
and
force
the
commodity
credit
corporation
to
make
the
loan.
there
are,
to
a
certain
extent,
some
discretionary
factors
to
be
considered
by
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
one,
is
there
a
need
for
the
facility
that
is
set
out
in
the
regulations?
but,
at
the
same
time,
we
concede
it
was
not
an
enforceable
right,
in
that,
you
could
not
go
into
court
to
enforce
it.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
language
of
the
statute
establishing
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
and
that's
set
forth
in
a
footnote
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
it
says
that
to
encourage
the
storage
of
grain
on
farms
where
it
could
be
stored
at
the
lowest
cost,
the
corporation
shall
make
loans
to
grain
growers
needing
storage
facilities.
the
commodity
credit
corporation
views
this
as
an
expressed
intent
of
congress,
that
such
loans
shall
be
granted
where
the
applicant
otherwise
qualifies
so
that
there
is,
in
a
real
sense,
a
right
conferred
on
the
farmer
to
apply
for
this
type
of
loan.
and,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
views
it
at
--
as
the
duty
of
the
corporation
to
make
the
loan
where
the
farmer
otherwise
qualifies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
broad
discretion.
i
don't
think
an
action
normally
lies.
there
may
be
situations--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
it
would
not
normally
lie.
there
may
be
situations
where,
if
there
were
some
type
of
act
of
discrimination
being
practiced
by
the
corporation
that
a
right
might
be
created
by
the
court
through
a
mandamus
proceedings
but
i
think,
normally,
this
is
--
congress
left
this
discretion
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
the
applicant
doesn't,
in
a
meaningful
sense,
have
a
right.
i'd
also
point
out
to
the
court
the
problems
that
exist
in
trying
to
interpret
this.
if
you
say
that
the
loan
application
is
not
a
claim,
does
a
claim
accrue
under
this
statute,
under
these
regulations
which
provide
the
regulations
setting
up
the
loan
program,
which
appear
at
7
code
of
federal
regulations
section
1474.727.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
but,
those
regulations
indicate
that
the
way
these
transactions
are
handled
or
that
the
loan
application
is
made
when
it
is
approved,
the
--
by
a
county
committee
that
processes
the
loan
applications,
when
the
county
committee
approves
the
loan,
a
commitment
is
issued
in
which
the
commodity
credit
corporation
agrees
that
it
will
issue
the
loan.
now,
at
this
point,
there's
a
binding
legal
obligation
on
the
government
on
the
corporation
to
issue
the
loan
once
the
other
qualifying
acts
take
place,
so
that
it
is
then
do
we
have
a
situation
where
to
question
the
word
“claim”
depends
upon
whether
or
not
there
is
a
commitment
or
whether
or
not,
as
under
other
programs,
if
you
have
the
loan
application
made
and
the
funds
immediately
dispersed,
would
you
say
that
that
is
not
a
claim
but
if
you
have
a
loan
application
with
a
commitment
issued
and
then
an
ap
--
another
step
taken
before
the
loan
is
actually
issued,
does
that
become
a
claim?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ype
of
incongruous
result
follows
from
the
test
which
the
court
laid
down
below.
we
do
not
think
that
that's
a
meaningful
test.
we
think
that
the
test
should
be,
as
we've
indicated,
whether
or
not
the
application
calls
for
the
disbursement
of
government
funds
or
the
transfer
of
government
property.
it's
a
clear
test.
it's
a
test
that
is
within
the
intent
of
congress.
it's
a
test
that
provides
very
--
it's
very
easy
of
application
for
it's
a
clear
standard.
we
think
it
is
the
one
that
should
be
adopted
by
the
court
in
this
case.
we
feel,
for
these
reasons,
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
penal
--
the
civil
provisions
provide
for
$2,000
forfeiture,
also
for
double
the
amount
of
actual
damages
proved.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
first,
i'd
address
myself
to
this
very
question
which
counsel
ended
that
as
a
situation
of
can
there
be
damaged
to
the
government.
certainly,
there
is
in
the
particular
situation
before
the
courts.
there
is
security
of
nature.
there
is
some
attempt
by
the
local
committees
to
check
on
that
security.
however,
the
rule
which
was
laid
down
by
the
court
below
would
apply
to
any
loan
situation
and
i
think
that
i
suppose
i'm
somewhat
onerous
by
my
own
experience
having
been
in
new
york
at
the
time
the
salad
oil
scandal
broke
when
the
greatest
frauds
in
a
country's
history
was
perpetrated
in
all
loan
situations
as
the
greatest
losses
that
we've
had,
i'm
sure,
in
the
financial
world
in
the
last
decade
where
all
loans
obvious
--
supposedly
secured
loans.
but,
in
fact,
there
was
no
such
security.
now,
the
court's
reading
below
would
apply
to
that
situation
as
well
as
the
one
we
have
here.
i'd
also
like
to
address
myself
to
counsel's
reliance
on
the
case
of
united
states
v.
cohn.
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
cohn
was
a
situation
which
a
shipment
of
cigars
that
come
in
from
the
philippines,
they're
being
held
in
a
customs
house.
these
were
non-dutiable
at
the
time.
cohn
procured
cato's
so
far
as
out
of
customs
custody
by
falsely
representing
that
the
bill
of
lading
hadn't
arrived
and
by
falsely
procuring
a
bond
that
the
bill
of
lading
would
be
produced.
in
fact,
the
bill
of
lading
had
arrived
and
it's
being
held
in
a
bank
for
payment
and
he
was
--
cohn
was
supposed
to
make
the
payment
and
then
take
the
bill
of
lading
to
the
customs
people.
so,
he
procured
goods
from
custom's
custody
by
use
of
this
false
statement.
however,
it
was
non-dutiable
merchandise
and
the
government
had
no
interest
in
it.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
because
the
government
was
not
dispersing
any
of
its
property
or
its
money.
then,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
claim.
i
think
that
is
the
exact
distinction
which
this
court
placed
on
the
cohn
case
in
u.s.
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
and
we've
set
out
the
language
at
page
15
whatthe
court
in
hess
said.
and,
i
think
it
applies
here
also,
quoting
from
hess,
“the
situation
here
is
in
no
sense
like
that
discussed
in
united
states
v.
cohn,
270
u.s.
339,
345-347,
where
the
government
acted
solely
as
barely
and
no
person
had
any
claim
against
it
for
a
payment.”
the
court
in
co
--
in
the
cohn
case
held
that
there
had
been
no
wrongful
obtaining
of
money
of
the
governments.
well,
there
has
been
such
a
wrongful
obtaining
here
on
claims
which
were
presented
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
government
with
full
knowledge
by
the
claimants
of
the
fraudulent
basis.
i
think
also
significant
is
the
fact
that,
in
us
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess,
the
false
statements
that
were
involved,
if
it
were
involved,
were
the
fraud
that
was
perpetrated
all
predated
the
contract.
as
i
read
the
facts
of
that
case,
what
happened
was
that
there
was
a
public
works
administration
project
proposed
and
the
collusive
--
it
was
collusive
bidding
which
was
the
fraud
involved
in
marcus.
so
that,
the
fraud
took
place
before
there
was
any
obligation
on
anyone's
part
to
make
any
type
of
payment.
what
happened
was
there
was
a
collusive
bidding.
that
was
the
fraud.
then,
contracts
issues
binding
the
local
government
to
make
payment
for
the
work
done
and
that
was
supported
through
government
payments
also,
but
you
have
very
much
the
situation
as
mr.
justice
fortas
point
out
here
where
the
--
you
have
the
fraud
then
a
contract
and
then
payment.
well,
here,
you
have
the
situation
of
the
loan
application,
a
commitment,
and
then
payment.
now,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
fortas,
with
your
analysis
that,
here,
there
was
a
binding
obligation.
we
also
submit
to
the
court
that
we
don't
feel
that
that
distinction
should
be
applied.
we
think
that
whether
or
not
a
loan
is
handled
through
a
commitment
procedure
or
whether
the
loan,
when
the
loan
is
approved,
the
funds
are
immediately
dispersed,
whether
that
should
be
a
controlling
difference
in
the
application
of
the
act.
but,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
do
have
the
situation
here
where
you
literally
fall
within
the
definition
of
the
court
below
shows
that
the
rule
which
the
court
set
down
is
not
a
helpful
one.
as
i
said,
we
feel
that
the
--
a
rule
that
said
that
any
time
you're
making
an
application
for
the
payment
of
government
funds,
the
disbursement
of
government
property,
that
is
a
claim
against
the
government.
all
of
the
programs
that
we're
dealing
with,
whether
or
not
they
involve
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
issuing
officer
where
they
give
him
some
discretion
to
determine
of
the
available
funds
who
shall
get
them
or
whether
there
is
a
need
and,
even
if
that
discretion
is
not
reviewable
in
the
court,
all
of
these
programs
manifest
an
intent
of
congress
that,
in
certain
situations,
these
loans
shall
issue.
and,
they
place
a
duty
on
that
officer,
who
was
sworn
to
enforce
the
laws
of
congress,
to
make
the
loans
when
the
situation
is
right
for
such
a
loan
to
be
made.
so,
there
is
a
right
in
the
individual
who
applied.
whether
or
not
that
right
may
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
law
is
another
question,
but
there
certainly
is
a
right
to
the
payment.
and,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
adopt
the
test
that
we
suggest
and
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
reinstate
--
order
the
reinstatement
of
the
complaint.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
affirming
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
montana,
which
dismissed
the
complaint
in
the
government's
action
under
the
civil
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
against
the
respondent,
neifert-white
company.
respondent
is
a
corporation
which
acts
as
a
dealer
in
grain
storage
bins.
the
complaint
in
this
action
charged
or
alleged
that,
on
12
separate
occasions
in
1959,
respondent
engaged
and
made
sales
to
various
individuals.
these
sales
were
financed
by
loans
obtained
from
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
according
to
the
applicable
regulations
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
the
corporation
was
authorized
to
issue
loans
on
storage
facilities
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
80%
of
the
purchase
price
of
that
facility.
the
complaint
in
this
action
alleged
that,
in
each
of
the
12
instances
referred
to,
the
respondent
submitted
to
the
commodity
credit
corporations
false
invoices
which
fraudulently
stated
and
inflated
the
purchase
price
of
the
bins
in
question.
the
result
of
this
fraud
being
that,
in
each
of
the
12
instances,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
was
caused
to
issue
loans
which
were,
in
fact,
in
access
of
80%
of
the
purchase
price
that
was
actually
paid
by
the
purchases.
in
dismissing
the
complaint
in
this
action,
the
--
and
in
affirming
that
dismissal,
the
court
below
ruled
that
a
loan
application
is
not
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
therefore,
the
only
and
the
sole
issue
presented
by
this
case
with
this
court's
decision
is
whether
or
not
a
loan
application
is
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
is
and
that
the
court
below
was
in
error
in
narrowly
construing
the
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act.
the
relevant
statutory
language
appears
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
and,
without
reading
all
of
that
language,
further
court--
the
key
language
in
this
statute
which
is
of
concern
here
is
that
the
statute
applies
to
any
claim
upon
or
against
the
government.
the
government's
position
that
that
language
means
--
what
the
court
referred
to
--
this
court
referred
to
in
united
states
v.
mcninch
when
it
said
that
the
conception
of
a
claim
against
the
government,
and
this
language
appears
at
page
10
in
our
brief,
the
court
said,
“the
conception
of
a
claim
against
the
government
normally
connotes
a
demand
for
money
over
some
transfer
of
property.”
that
is
the
test
which
we
submit
should
be
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
claim
against
the
government.
is
the
applicant
seeking
the
payment
of
government
funds
for
the
transfer
of
government
property?
we
think
that
the
construction
that
we
urge
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose
in
enacting
the
false
claims
act
that
it
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
in
line
with
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
and,
in
addition,
that
the
standard
set
down
by
the
court
below,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
assertion
of
a
legal
right,
is
not
a
meaningful
standard
which
can
be
clearly
applied
by
either
the
justice
department
or
the
courts
below.
looking
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
the
courts
--
this
is
the
first
case
to
come
before
this
court
and
also
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
loan
is
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act
has
been
expressly
considered
by
the
courts.
it
has,
in
a
number
of
cases,
three
cases
appear
in
--
that
came
before
this
court,
united
states
v.
rainwater,
united
states
v.
cato,
and
united
states
v.
toepleman
were
here
before
this
court
and
the
issue
raised
in
those
cases
was
whether
the
commodity
credit
corporation
was
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
implicit
in
the
holding
that
sustained
an
action
under
the
false
claims
act
against
those
defendants
was
that
a
loan
is
a
claim.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
was
not,
mr.
justice
white,
except
--
with
this
exception,
that
the
word
--
the
meaning
of
the
word
“claim”
was
argued
in
a
slightly
different
context
in
a
companion
case.
you
had
cato
and
toepleman
were
decided
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
v.
mcninch.
mcninch
involved
an
application
for
credit
insurance.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
court
did
not
expressly
deal
with
that
question,
mr.
justice
white.
it
did,
as
i
just
quoted
in
the
court's
language
in
mcninch,
and
i
think
important
in
that
is
what
mr.
justice
black
writing
for
the
court
said
in
that
case.
he
said
that,
in
dealing
with
mcninch
which
was
the
case
involving
an
application
for
credit
insurance
and
the
government
was
arguing
that
case
that
the
application
for
credit
insurance
was
a
claim.
and,
mr.
justice
black,
speaking
for
the
court
in
that
case,
said
that,
normally,
the
term
“claim,”
this
language
is
again
in
our
brief
at
page
10,
he
recognized
that,
literally,
the
term
“claim”
could
be
considered
to
cover
and
i
am
quoting
the
assertion
of
“a
right
or
privilege
to
draw
upon
the
government's
credit.”
so,
he
recognized
in
that
case
that
the
term
“claim”
could
have
that
reached
under
literal
application,
but
he
said
in
mcninch
that
the
problem
was
that
there
was
no
demand
for
immediate
transfer
of
government
funds
or
government
property.
and,
the
court
said
in
a
footnote
in
the
mcninch
opinion
that
we
will
leave
to
another
day
the
question
of
what
happens
when
there
has
been
a
default
on
the
loan
the
government
is
required
to
payout,
whether
that,
in
that
context,
becomes
a
claim.
so
that,
the
--
i
do
think
that
these
cases
have
some
value
because
the
question
of
what
was
a
claim
was
at
issue,
although
in
a
different
context,
and
no
one
ever
dispute
it,
either
the
attorneys
or
the
court,
that
an
application
for
a
loan
was
a
claim.
we
think
that
the
construction
that
we
urge
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose.
the
court
made
clear
in
mcninch
and
it
had
said
in
us
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
that
a
claim--
that
the
purpose
of
the
false
claims
act
was
to
protect
the
public
treasury.
certainly,
in
the
type
with
as
many
government
loan
programs
that
we
have
today,
this
is
an
important
method
in
which
the
public
treasury
can
be
depleted
by
fraudulent
loan
applications.
just
to
point
out
the
statistics
in
the
commodity
credit
corporation
alone,
that
last
year
they
issued
approximately
$1.4
billion
with
loans
on
crops.
the
grains
--
the
storage
facility
program
resulted
in
the
issuance
of
approximately
$15
million
worth
of
loans.
these
are
only
two
of
the
government's
loan
programs
and,
we
submit,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
that
these
government
loan
funds
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
false
claims
act.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
counsel
has
stated
in
his
brief
that
the
government
does
not
need
the
protection
of
the
false
claims
act
because
it
--
civil
provisions
because
it
does
have
the
criminal
provisions
of
section
1001
of
title
18,
and
that
any
false
claim
in
a
loan
application
for
a
statement
of
loan
application
would
be
covered
by
that.
however,
i
do
think
the
statutory
framework
sets
up
a
range
of
possible
alternative
action
the
government
could
take.
criminal
action
is
one,
but
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
there
may
be
false
statements
contained
in
loan
applications
or
other
types
of
claims
where
it's
a
single
instance,
it's
relatively
minor,
where
perhaps
the
invocation
of
criminal
sanctions
is
too
severe.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
provide
the
government
with
a
reasonable
alternative
way
of
proceeding
in
that
type
of
case,
and
so
that
this
does
perform
a
fairly
substantial
function.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
this
is
the
first
--
as
i
say,
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
issue
has
come
up.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no.
it's
never
been
raised.
i
don't
think
that
it's
ever
been
thought
of
until
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
has
been
assumed
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
take
it,
a
loan
application
was
a
claim.
it
was
assumed
in
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
now,
as
i
stated,
we
think
that
our
reading
of
the
statute
comports
with
the
intent
of
congress.
we
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
which
deci
--
the
cases
decided
by
this
court.
we
also
think
that
the
rule
which
the
court
below
laid
down
is
really
not
a
meaningful
test.
to
say
that
the
false
claims
act
will
apply
where
there
is
an
assertion
of
a
legal
right
leads
to
the
question
what
does
that
mean
in
the
context
of
this
case?
these
applications
--
these
loan
applications
were
submitted
under
what
we
conceded
below.
i
want
to
privies
my
remarks
by
saying
we
conceded
below
the
person
making
a
loan
application
could
not
go
into
court
and
force
the
commodity
credit
corporation
to
make
the
loan.
there
are,
to
a
certain
extent,
some
discretionary
factors
to
be
considered
by
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
one,
is
there
a
need
for
the
facility
that
is
set
out
in
the
regulations?
but,
at
the
same
time,
we
concede
it
was
not
an
enforceable
right,
in
that,
you
could
not
go
into
court
to
enforce
it.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
language
of
the
statute
establishing
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
and
that's
set
forth
in
a
footnote
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
it
says
that
to
encourage
the
storage
of
grain
on
farms
where
it
could
be
stored
at
the
lowest
cost,
the
corporation
shall
make
loans
to
grain
growers
needing
storage
facilities.
the
commodity
credit
corporation
views
this
as
an
expressed
intent
of
congress,
that
such
loans
shall
be
granted
where
the
applicant
otherwise
qualifies
so
that
there
is,
in
a
real
sense,
a
right
conferred
on
the
farmer
to
apply
for
this
type
of
loan.
and,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
views
it
at
--
as
the
duty
of
the
corporation
to
make
the
loan
where
the
farmer
otherwise
qualifies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
broad
discretion.
i
don't
think
an
action
normally
lies.
there
may
be
situations--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
it
would
not
normally
lie.
there
may
be
situations
where,
if
there
were
some
type
of
act
of
discrimination
being
practiced
by
the
corporation
that
a
right
might
be
created
by
the
court
through
a
mandamus
proceedings
but
i
think,
normally,
this
is
--
congress
left
this
discretion
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
the
applicant
doesn't,
in
a
meaningful
sense,
have
a
right.
i'd
also
point
out
to
the
court
the
problems
that
exist
in
trying
to
interpret
this.
if
you
say
that
the
loan
application
is
not
a
claim,
does
a
claim
accrue
under
this
statute,
under
these
regulations
which
provide
the
regulations
setting
up
the
loan
program,
which
appear
at
7
code
of
federal
regulations
section
1474.727.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
but,
those
regulations
indicate
that
the
way
these
transactions
are
handled
or
that
the
loan
application
is
made
when
it
is
approved,
the
--
by
a
county
committee
that
processes
the
loan
applications,
when
the
county
committee
approves
the
loan,
a
commitment
is
issued
in
which
the
commodity
credit
corporation
agrees
that
it
will
issue
the
loan.
now,
at
this
point,
there's
a
binding
legal
obligation
on
the
government
on
the
corporation
to
issue
the
loan
once
the
other
qualifying
acts
take
place,
so
that
it
is
then
do
we
have
a
situation
where
to
question
the
word
“claim”
depends
upon
whether
or
not
there
is
a
commitment
or
whether
or
not,
as
under
other
programs,
if
you
have
the
loan
application
made
and
the
funds
immediately
dispersed,
would
you
say
that
that
is
not
a
claim
but
if
you
have
a
loan
application
with
a
commitment
issued
and
then
an
ap
--
another
step
taken
before
the
loan
is
actually
issued,
does
that
become
a
claim?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ype
of
incongruous
result
follows
from
the
test
which
the
court
laid
down
below.
we
do
not
think
that
that's
a
meaningful
test.
we
think
that
the
test
should
be,
as
we've
indicated,
whether
or
not
the
application
calls
for
the
disbursement
of
government
funds
or
the
transfer
of
government
property.
it's
a
clear
test.
it's
a
test
that
is
within
the
intent
of
congress.
it's
a
test
that
provides
very
--
it's
very
easy
of
application
for
it's
a
clear
standard.
we
think
it
is
the
one
that
should
be
adopted
by
the
court
in
this
case.
we
feel,
for
these
reasons,
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
penal
--
the
civil
provisions
provide
for
$2,000
forfeiture,
also
for
double
the
amount
of
actual
damages
proved.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
first,
i'd
address
myself
to
this
very
question
which
counsel
ended
that
as
a
situation
of
can
there
be
damaged
to
the
government.
certainly,
there
is
in
the
particular
situation
before
the
courts.
there
is
security
of
nature.
there
is
some
attempt
by
the
local
committees
to
check
on
that
security.
however,
the
rule
which
was
laid
down
by
the
court
below
would
apply
to
any
loan
situation
and
i
think
that
i
suppose
i'm
somewhat
onerous
by
my
own
experience
having
been
in
new
york
at
the
time
the
salad
oil
scandal
broke
when
the
greatest
frauds
in
a
country's
history
was
perpetrated
in
all
loan
situations
as
the
greatest
losses
that
we've
had,
i'm
sure,
in
the
financial
world
in
the
last
decade
where
all
loans
obvious
--
supposedly
secured
loans.
but,
in
fact,
there
was
no
such
security.
now,
the
court's
reading
below
would
apply
to
that
situation
as
well
as
the
one
we
have
here.
i'd
also
like
to
address
myself
to
counsel's
reliance
on
the
case
of
united
states
v.
cohn.
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
cohn
was
a
situation
which
a
shipment
of
cigars
that
come
in
from
the
philippines,
they're
being
held
in
a
customs
house.
these
were
non-dutiable
at
the
time.
cohn
procured
cato's
so
far
as
out
of
customs
custody
by
falsely
representing
that
the
bill
of
lading
hadn't
arrived
and
by
falsely
procuring
a
bond
that
the
bill
of
lading
would
be
produced.
in
fact,
the
bill
of
lading
had
arrived
and
it's
being
held
in
a
bank
for
payment
and
he
was
--
cohn
was
supposed
to
make
the
payment
and
then
take
the
bill
of
lading
to
the
customs
people.
so,
he
procured
goods
from
custom's
custody
by
use
of
this
false
statement.
however,
it
was
non-dutiable
merchandise
and
the
government
had
no
interest
in
it.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
because
the
government
was
not
dispersing
any
of
its
property
or
its
money.
then,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
claim.
i
think
that
is
the
exact
distinction
which
this
court
placed
on
the
cohn
case
in
u.s.
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
and
we've
set
out
the
language
at
page
15
whatthe
court
in
hess
said.
and,
i
think
it
applies
here
also,
quoting
from
hess,
“the
situation
here
is
in
no
sense
like
that
discussed
in
united
states
v.
cohn,
270
u.s.
339,
345-347,
where
the
government
acted
solely
as
barely
and
no
person
had
any
claim
against
it
for
a
payment.”
the
court
in
co
--
in
the
cohn
case
held
that
there
had
been
no
wrongful
obtaining
of
money
of
the
governments.
well,
there
has
been
such
a
wrongful
obtaining
here
on
claims
which
were
presented
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
government
with
full
knowledge
by
the
claimants
of
the
fraudulent
basis.
i
think
also
significant
is
the
fact
that,
in
us
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess,
the
false
statements
that
were
involved,
if
it
were
involved,
were
the
fraud
that
was
perpetrated
all
predated
the
contract.
as
i
read
the
facts
of
that
case,
what
happened
was
that
there
was
a
public
works
administration
project
proposed
and
the
collusive
--
it
was
collusive
bidding
which
was
the
fraud
involved
in
marcus.
so
that,
the
fraud
took
place
before
there
was
any
obligation
on
anyone's
part
to
make
any
type
of
payment.
what
happened
was
there
was
a
collusive
bidding.
that
was
the
fraud.
then,
contracts
issues
binding
the
local
government
to
make
payment
for
the
work
done
and
that
was
supported
through
government
payments
also,
but
you
have
very
much
the
situation
as
mr.
justice
fortas
point
out
here
where
the
--
you
have
the
fraud
then
a
contract
and
then
payment.
well,
here,
you
have
the
situation
of
the
loan
application,
a
commitment,
and
then
payment.
now,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
fortas,
with
your
analysis
that,
here,
there
was
a
binding
obligation.
we
also
submit
to
the
court
that
we
don't
feel
that
that
distinction
should
be
applied.
we
think
that
whether
or
not
a
loan
is
handled
through
a
commitment
procedure
or
whether
the
loan,
when
the
loan
is
approved,
the
funds
are
immediately
dispersed,
whether
that
should
be
a
controlling
difference
in
the
application
of
the
act.
but,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
do
have
the
situation
here
where
you
literally
fall
within
the
definition
of
the
court
below
shows
that
the
rule
which
the
court
set
down
is
not
a
helpful
one.
as
i
said,
we
feel
that
the
--
a
rule
that
said
that
any
time
you're
making
an
application
for
the
payment
of
government
funds,
the
disbursement
of
government
property,
that
is
a
claim
against
the
government.
all
of
the
programs
that
we're
dealing
with,
whether
or
not
they
involve
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
issuing
officer
where
they
give
him
some
discretion
to
determine
of
the
available
funds
who
shall
get
them
or
whether
there
is
a
need
and,
even
if
that
discretion
is
not
reviewable
in
the
court,
all
of
these
programs
manifest
an
intent
of
congress
that,
in
certain
situations,
these
loans
shall
issue.
and,
they
place
a
duty
on
that
officer,
who
was
sworn
to
enforce
the
laws
of
congress,
to
make
the
loans
when
the
situation
is
right
for
such
a
loan
to
be
made.
so,
there
is
a
right
in
the
individual
who
applied.
whether
or
not
that
right
may
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
law
is
another
question,
but
there
certainly
is
a
right
to
the
payment.
and,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
adopt
the
test
that
we
suggest
and
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
reinstate
--
order
the
reinstatement
of
the
complaint.
