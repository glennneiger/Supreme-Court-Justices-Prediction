mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
issue
stated
by
the
government
is
somewhat
too
broad.
quite
selfishly,
we
believe
the
issue
to
be
whether
these
particular
loans
and
the
filing
of
the
invoice
in
connection
there
with
--
in
connection
there
with
in
the
12
several
counts
are
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
i
think
one
reason,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
mr.
martin,
that
this
particular
question
has
not
been
before
the
circuit
court
because
this
is
a
somewhat
different
loan
situation
in
other
government
programs
and,
in
particular,
that
in
rainwater
and
kegel.
they
were
dealing,
and
i
think
this
is
illustrated
in
u.s.
v.
templeton,
a
circuit
court
decision
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
they
were
dealing
with
the
form
of
subsidy.
it
isn't
really
a
loan
in
the
normal
sense
because
the
farmer
goes
in,
in
wheat
situations.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
isn't
really
a
loan.
it's
a--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it's
a
purchase.
the
farmer,
if
the
market
goes
up,
can
pay
off
the
loan
and
sell
on
the
market.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
--
the
facts
aren't
set
forth
in
sufficient
length
in
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
white,
for
me
to
understand
the
cotton
loan,
but
it
looks
just
like
a
wheat
loan
that
i
am
familiar
with.
but,
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
loan
that's
on
all
fours
with
the
bank
loan.
the
regulations
provide
that
when
the
committee
--
if
the
committee
does
exercise
its
discretion
and
grant
a
loan
for
a
farm
storage
facility,
they
take
a
channel
mortgage.
they
take
a
severance
agreement.
they
have
the
right,
in
addition
to
a
channel
mortgage,
to
take
a
mortgage
on,
first
mortgage,
on
the
farmer's
real
property.
the
regulations
provide
that
the
farmer
pays
all
the
recording
cost
and
filing
fee.
he
also
--
before
disbursement
can
be
made,
the
facility,
as
erected,
must
be
inspected
by
the
government.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
i
think
if
they
were
obligated,
the
circuit
court
would
be
wrong.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
but
we
do
point
this
out,
that
this
is
a
situation.
i
think
there
is
one
point
there,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
you
then
would
get
involved
in
the
question
of
whether
there
was
financial
detriment
to
the
government
because,
really,
aren't
they
--
they
are
just
changing
assets.
they
have
the
security.
i
think
a
bank,
when
they
make
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
put
out
the
funds
but
they
take
back
the
security.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
believe
that
the
concession
made
by
the
government
was
dictated
by
the
facts
that
there
was
no
legal
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
court
below,
citing
u.s.
v.
cohn
at
270
montana
which
i
believe
to
be
the
first
false
claim
decision
decided
by
this
court,
said
that
this
is
not
a
claim
situation
because
it
does
not
involve
a
claim
for
money
or
property
to
which
a
right
is
asserted
against
the
government
based
on
the
government's
liability
to
the
claimant.
now,
since
1926,
that
has
been
the
accepted
definition
of
what
is
a
claim
under
the
false
claims
act.
that
decision
was
cited
as
having
relevance
in
the
mcninch
case
at
356
u.s.
the
government
argues
against
this
interpretation
and
says
cohn
is
no
longer
of
importance
because
of
marcus
v.
hess.
we
disagree
violently
with
that
interpretation.
all
marcus
v.
hess
holds
is
that
the
one
committing
the
alleged
fraud
does
not
have
to
be
the
claimant.
there,
we
had
collusive
agreements
between
a
bunch
of
contractors
on
a
program
which
the
pwa
was
entered
into
--
had
entered
into
certain
municipalities
and
school
districts
in
pennsylvania.
because
of
the
fraud
practiced
by
the
contractors,
the
government
money
was
paid
out,
but
to
hold
that
that
is
not
a
claim
situation
because
the
contractors
could
not
sue
the
government
would
be
to
say
that
the
government
could
back
off
at
any
time
from
paying
the
municipalities.
the
government
was
in
the
program.
it
was
a
claim
situation,
and
the
only
thing
marcus
v.
hess
stands
for
in
that
regard
is
that
the
false
claims
act
touches
everyone
who
causes
a
false
claim
to
be
made.
an
excellent
example
of
the
hess
doctrine
is
found
in
u.s.
v.
lagerbusch
in
the
third
circuit.
there,
lagerbusch
worked
for
hercules
powder
company.
hercules
had
a
cost
plus
contract
with
the
government.
lagerbusch
submitted
some
kind
of
false
payroll
record
or
somehow
got
excess
moneys
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
from
hercules.
it
was
cost
plus.
hercules
filed
a
claim
based
in
part
on
that.
there
was
a
claim
situation,
a
right
asserted.
lagerbuschcould
not
sue
the
government
but
the
government
had
a
right
asserted
against
it.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
neifert-white?
neifert-white
was
prosecuted,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
were
prosecuted
not
under
a
false
claim,
the
criminal
but
--
under
317
(m),
i
believe,
of
the
commodity
credit
act
on
two
counts.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
pardon?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
filing
a
false
statement.
the
exact
statute
is
15
u.s.c.
1771
--714
(m)(a),
two
counts
but
there
was
no
false
claim.
it
is
not
the
counterpart
--
the
criminal
counterpart
of
the
civil
statute.
it's
just
a
false
statement.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
15
u.s.c.
paragraph
714
(m)(a),
whoever
makes
any
statement
knowing
it
to
be
false,
whoever
willfully
overvalues
any
security
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
action
with
the
government,
and
so
forth.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it's
merely
a
false
statement.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
which
really
set--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
for
the
purpose
of
influence
in
any
way
the
action
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
or
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
for
himself
another
money,
property,
or
anything
of
value.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
think
the
language
is
significantly
different.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
same,
in
fact,
i
can't
recall
the
two
particular
counts
but
there
were
two
there
in
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
criminal
action
was
commenced
and
concluded
long
prior
to
the
civil
action.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
believe,
nolo
contendere.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
both
counts.
because,
very
frankly,
i
represented
the
client
at
that
hearing
and
we're
guilty
of
making
a
false
statement
but
that's
a
far
cry
in
our
opinion
for
making
a
false
claim
under
the
civil
section.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
believe
it
was
$250
on
both
counts.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
your
honor,
it's
the
same
case.
it's
outside
the
record
that
these
loans
were
fully
repaid.
there
isn't
any
loss
to
the
government.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
there's
no
loss
to
the
government
here.
the
loans
were
fully
repaid.
this
man
actually
was
passing
on
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
still
would
not
be
a
false
claim,
in
our
view,
because
there
is
no
legal
right
asserted
to
--
against
the
government
for
money
or
property
of
the
government
based
on
the
government's
obligation
to
any
claimant.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
i
can't
see
how
the
government
could
any
--
ever
lose
in
this
particular
transaction.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no.
the
payment
of
money?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
there
would.
in
rex
trailer
v.
u.s.,
in
a
footnote,
this
court
--
and
i
think
this
destroys
a
good
portion
of
the
government's
argument,
the
thrust
of
it
seems
to
be
that
there
has
to
be
an
outgo
of
money.
that
isn't
so.
in
rex
trailer
sales
v.
u.s.,
this
court
said,
in
viewing
marcus
v.
hess,
that
in
the
marcus
situation
the
government
discovered
some
of
the
fraud
on
behalf
of
the
contractors
before
they
paid
it.
so,
they
didn't
pay
but
that
was
still
a
claim
situation.
and,
the
third
or
fourth
circuit
in
the
ridglea
bank
--state
bank
case
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
reply
brief
is
the
same
situation.
a
claim
is
a
claim.
the
payment
of
money
per
se
is
not
necessary
to
make
it
so.
but,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
conceive
of
how
the
government
could
lose
money
in
this
situation.
i
would
deny
vigorously
that
that
was
ever
the
intent.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
he
had
to
purchase
the
grain
bins.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
under
this
program,
the
purpose
was
to
encourage
farm
storage
of
grain
products.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
could
borrow
up
to
80%
and,
if
they
were
qualified
and
went
through
all
the
rigmarole
to
get
the
loan,
then
they
had
to
go
out
and
buy
one.
these
were
just
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
farmers
in
these
cases?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
each
and
all
of
these
farmers
qualified.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
qualified
on
their
own.
they
had
to
do
that
first.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
only
place
neifert-white
comes
in
is
that
--
it's
provided
in
the
regulations
that
the
farmer,
in
connection
with
his
application,
must
submit
an
invoice
showing
the
price
of
the
bins,
price
of
the
product
that
he
buys,
and
that's
what
neifert-white.
they
put
in
a
statement
based
on
the
butler
list
price,
a
fair
trade
price,
fob
towns
in
montana.
the
actual
price
that
neifert-white
charged
the
bins
out
to
the
growers
was
somewhat
smaller.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
they're
on
from
$38.40
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
to
$366,
the
high
and
the
low
here.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that's
right.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
was
--
it
would
be
about
$120
invoice
price
and
the
farmer
paid
$100.
that
would
be
roughly
comparable.
we
believe
and
submit
to
this
court
that
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
one
not
only
consistent
with
cohn,
consistent
with
mcninch,
but
it's
consistent
with
all
of
the
cases
decided
because
--
and
cited
in
the
brief
because,
when
you
go
through
those
cases,
in
most
of
them
you
will
find
there
is
a
claim
situation.
us
v.
brown
is
an
example.
u.s.
v.
(inaudible).
there
--
that's
the
follow
up
of
the
mcninch
case
where
there
was
a
default
in
the
fha
loan
but,
there,
there's
no
discretion
in
the
government.
once
there's
a
default,
there's
a
demand
and
the
government
is
going
to
pay.
we
believe
that,
as
the
court
said
in
tieger,
that
--
the
circuit
court
said
in
tieger
and
quoted
in
mcninch,
that
normal
usage
of
the
language
that
when
you
have
a
claim
it's
a
demand
and,
when
you
demand,
you
have
a
right
to
get
it.
here,
that's
not
present.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
statute
and
the
regulations
authorized
the
making
of
the
loans.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
totally
discretionary
with
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
they
have
found
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i'm
sure
he
used
good
faith
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
in
the
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
certainly
it's
something
that
a
farmer,
if
he
were
denied,
could
not
seek
legal
redress.
that's
our
position.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
under
the
--
the
fact
that
the
filing
of
an
invoice
is
a
claim,
no,
sir.
we
–
it
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that
situation
is
clearly
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
is
not
a
claim.
it
doesn't
come
within
the
definition
of
cohn.
we
don't
feel
it
comes
within
the
definition
of
any
of
these
other
cases.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
can
do
it
on
the
farmer's
past
growing
history,
his
need
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
you
have
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
so
far
as
i
can
read
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
they
would.
i
think
it
would
be
an
arbitrary
discretion
--
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
government's
power.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
all
i
--
as
i
read
the
regulations,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
could
grant
it
at
their
whim.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
no.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
the
committee
de
--
the
determination
is
a
committee
rather
than
an
official
and
they're
elected
by
the
farmers
themselves.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
would
not
believe
so.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
but,
i
--
from
the
regulations
and
the
statute,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
have
--
they
do
have
the
right
to
deny.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
and,
i
again
point
out
that
we
concur
on
the
government's
concession
on
this
point,
as
did
the
circuit
court,
that
there
was
no
legal
obligation.
the
government
contends
in
brief
at
some
length
that
this,
of
course,
is
an
open
door
in
connection
with
all
of
their
programs.
i
think
the
cases
cited
in
all
of
the
circumstances
under
false
claim
reflect
how
the
variances
occur
between
programs,
whether
there
is
a
claim
situation
or
not.
and
i
don't
certainly
--
personally
have
facts
of
all
of
these
programs
where
you
could
--
where
i
could
differentiate
them.
i
think
it's
something
that
will
have
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
because
i
think
each
program
is
in
fact
different.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
would
say
no.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
because
it's
basically
what
happened
here.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
and
it
is
not
a
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
is
not
a
claim
situation
because
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
at
that
time,
he'd
be
entitled
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
believe
that,
certainly,
this
situation
is
narrowly
squarely
within
cohn.
that
test
has
to
be
observed
but,
as
pointed
out
in
mcninch,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
essentially
a
criminal
statute
and,
as
this
court
said
in
mcninch,
its
provisions
must
be
carefully
restricted.
and,
as
the
court
also
observed
in
mcninch,
it's
not
designed
to
reach
every
fraud
perpetrated
upon
the
government,
and
the
cohn
definition
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
circuit
court
decision
has
been
the
accepted
definition
in
all
of
the
false
claims
decisions
since
1926.
the
government's
open
door
argument,
i
think,
should
properly
be
addressed
to
congress
rather
than
to
the
court
if
the
government
in
fact,
in
the
proliferation
of
government
programs,
needs
additional
sanctions
which
they
can
impose
civilly.
certainly,
it
would
be
relatively
easy
to
do
so
in
connection
with
the
legislation
enacting
the
programs
and
as
we
have
discussed
before,
they
have
the
criminal
provisions.
the
criminal
provisions
have
been
criminally
enforced
against
neifert-white
here.
we
believe
that,
just
as
in
mcninch
and
tieger
where
the
government
sought
to
extend
the
provisions
of
the
act
beyond
a
historic
definition
of
cohn,
beyond
the
purpose
of
congress,
the
courts
said
“no,
we'll
not
go
that
far.
it
is
not
designed
to
reach
every
fraud.”
this
court
should
likewise
reach
the
same
result
and
affirm
the
circuit
court
opinion.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
to
prevent
the
plundering
of
the
treasury.
this
statute
came
out
of
the
civil
war
and
apparently,
there
was
a
horrendous
and
widespread
raid
on
the
treasury.
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
shows
just
that
plundering
a
financial
outcome,
the
government
being
defrauded,
payment
of
money
is
on
an
assertation
of
right.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
there,
again
the
government
never
lost
a
nickel
in
this
situation.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
would
only
result
if
there
was
a
breakdown
on
the
local
level
where
they
did
not
get
adequate
security.
it's
the
only
way
it
could
result
in
that.
here,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
government
only
loaned,
in
one
case,
$38
more
than
they
should've
on
a
$400
loan.
these
are
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
minor
amount
of
money.
in
our
view,
it
is
not
in
any
sense
a
plunder
situation.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
your
honor,
but
i
expressed
those
figures
because
it
does
not,
with
a
security,
seem
to
us
it
is
a
plunder
situation
that
was
contemplated
by
the
enactors
of
the
false
claims
act
in
1863.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
issue
stated
by
the
government
is
somewhat
too
broad.
quite
selfishly,
we
believe
the
issue
to
be
whether
these
particular
loans
and
the
filing
of
the
invoice
in
connection
there
with
--
in
connection
there
with
in
the
12
several
counts
are
a
claim
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
i
think
one
reason,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
mr.
martin,
that
this
particular
question
has
not
been
before
the
circuit
court
because
this
is
a
somewhat
different
loan
situation
in
other
government
programs
and,
in
particular,
that
in
rainwater
and
kegel.
they
were
dealing,
and
i
think
this
is
illustrated
in
u.s.
v.
templeton,
a
circuit
court
decision
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
they
were
dealing
with
the
form
of
subsidy.
it
isn't
really
a
loan
in
the
normal
sense
because
the
farmer
goes
in,
in
wheat
situations.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
isn't
really
a
loan.
it's
a--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it's
a
purchase.
the
farmer,
if
the
market
goes
up,
can
pay
off
the
loan
and
sell
on
the
market.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
--
the
facts
aren't
set
forth
in
sufficient
length
in
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
white,
for
me
to
understand
the
cotton
loan,
but
it
looks
just
like
a
wheat
loan
that
i
am
familiar
with.
but,
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
loan
that's
on
all
fours
with
the
bank
loan.
the
regulations
provide
that
when
the
committee
--
if
the
committee
does
exercise
its
discretion
and
grant
a
loan
for
a
farm
storage
facility,
they
take
a
channel
mortgage.
they
take
a
severance
agreement.
they
have
the
right,
in
addition
to
a
channel
mortgage,
to
take
a
mortgage
on,
first
mortgage,
on
the
farmer's
real
property.
the
regulations
provide
that
the
farmer
pays
all
the
recording
cost
and
filing
fee.
he
also
--
before
disbursement
can
be
made,
the
facility,
as
erected,
must
be
inspected
by
the
government.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
i
think
if
they
were
obligated,
the
circuit
court
would
be
wrong.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
but
we
do
point
this
out,
that
this
is
a
situation.
i
think
there
is
one
point
there,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
you
then
would
get
involved
in
the
question
of
whether
there
was
financial
detriment
to
the
government
because,
really,
aren't
they
--
they
are
just
changing
assets.
they
have
the
security.
i
think
a
bank,
when
they
make
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
put
out
the
funds
but
they
take
back
the
security.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
believe
that
the
concession
made
by
the
government
was
dictated
by
the
facts
that
there
was
no
legal
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
court
below,
citing
u.s.
v.
cohn
at
270
montana
which
i
believe
to
be
the
first
false
claim
decision
decided
by
this
court,
said
that
this
is
not
a
claim
situation
because
it
does
not
involve
a
claim
for
money
or
property
to
which
a
right
is
asserted
against
the
government
based
on
the
government's
liability
to
the
claimant.
now,
since
1926,
that
has
been
the
accepted
definition
of
what
is
a
claim
under
the
false
claims
act.
that
decision
was
cited
as
having
relevance
in
the
mcninch
case
at
356
u.s.
the
government
argues
against
this
interpretation
and
says
cohn
is
no
longer
of
importance
because
of
marcus
v.
hess.
we
disagree
violently
with
that
interpretation.
all
marcus
v.
hess
holds
is
that
the
one
committing
the
alleged
fraud
does
not
have
to
be
the
claimant.
there,
we
had
collusive
agreements
between
a
bunch
of
contractors
on
a
program
which
the
pwa
was
entered
into
--
had
entered
into
certain
municipalities
and
school
districts
in
pennsylvania.
because
of
the
fraud
practiced
by
the
contractors,
the
government
money
was
paid
out,
but
to
hold
that
that
is
not
a
claim
situation
because
the
contractors
could
not
sue
the
government
would
be
to
say
that
the
government
could
back
off
at
any
time
from
paying
the
municipalities.
the
government
was
in
the
program.
it
was
a
claim
situation,
and
the
only
thing
marcus
v.
hess
stands
for
in
that
regard
is
that
the
false
claims
act
touches
everyone
who
causes
a
false
claim
to
be
made.
an
excellent
example
of
the
hess
doctrine
is
found
in
u.s.
v.
lagerbusch
in
the
third
circuit.
there,
lagerbusch
worked
for
hercules
powder
company.
hercules
had
a
cost
plus
contract
with
the
government.
lagerbusch
submitted
some
kind
of
false
payroll
record
or
somehow
got
excess
moneys
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
from
hercules.
it
was
cost
plus.
hercules
filed
a
claim
based
in
part
on
that.
there
was
a
claim
situation,
a
right
asserted.
lagerbuschcould
not
sue
the
government
but
the
government
had
a
right
asserted
against
it.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
neifert-white?
neifert-white
was
prosecuted,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
were
prosecuted
not
under
a
false
claim,
the
criminal
but
--
under
317
(m),
i
believe,
of
the
commodity
credit
act
on
two
counts.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
pardon?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
filing
a
false
statement.
the
exact
statute
is
15
u.s.c.
1771
--714
(m)(a),
two
counts
but
there
was
no
false
claim.
it
is
not
the
counterpart
--
the
criminal
counterpart
of
the
civil
statute.
it's
just
a
false
statement.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
15
u.s.c.
paragraph
714
(m)(a),
whoever
makes
any
statement
knowing
it
to
be
false,
whoever
willfully
overvalues
any
security
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
action
with
the
government,
and
so
forth.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it's
merely
a
false
statement.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
which
really
set--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
for
the
purpose
of
influence
in
any
way
the
action
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
or
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
for
himself
another
money,
property,
or
anything
of
value.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
think
the
language
is
significantly
different.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
same,
in
fact,
i
can't
recall
the
two
particular
counts
but
there
were
two
there
in
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
criminal
action
was
commenced
and
concluded
long
prior
to
the
civil
action.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
believe,
nolo
contendere.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
both
counts.
because,
very
frankly,
i
represented
the
client
at
that
hearing
and
we're
guilty
of
making
a
false
statement
but
that's
a
far
cry
in
our
opinion
for
making
a
false
claim
under
the
civil
section.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
believe
it
was
$250
on
both
counts.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
your
honor,
it's
the
same
case.
it's
outside
the
record
that
these
loans
were
fully
repaid.
there
isn't
any
loss
to
the
government.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
there's
no
loss
to
the
government
here.
the
loans
were
fully
repaid.
this
man
actually
was
passing
on
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
still
would
not
be
a
false
claim,
in
our
view,
because
there
is
no
legal
right
asserted
to
--
against
the
government
for
money
or
property
of
the
government
based
on
the
government's
obligation
to
any
claimant.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
i
can't
see
how
the
government
could
any
--
ever
lose
in
this
particular
transaction.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no.
the
payment
of
money?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
there
would.
in
rex
trailer
v.
u.s.,
in
a
footnote,
this
court
--
and
i
think
this
destroys
a
good
portion
of
the
government's
argument,
the
thrust
of
it
seems
to
be
that
there
has
to
be
an
outgo
of
money.
that
isn't
so.
in
rex
trailer
sales
v.
u.s.,
this
court
said,
in
viewing
marcus
v.
hess,
that
in
the
marcus
situation
the
government
discovered
some
of
the
fraud
on
behalf
of
the
contractors
before
they
paid
it.
so,
they
didn't
pay
but
that
was
still
a
claim
situation.
and,
the
third
or
fourth
circuit
in
the
ridglea
bank
--state
bank
case
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
reply
brief
is
the
same
situation.
a
claim
is
a
claim.
the
payment
of
money
per
se
is
not
necessary
to
make
it
so.
but,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
conceive
of
how
the
government
could
lose
money
in
this
situation.
i
would
deny
vigorously
that
that
was
ever
the
intent.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
he
had
to
purchase
the
grain
bins.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
under
this
program,
the
purpose
was
to
encourage
farm
storage
of
grain
products.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
could
borrow
up
to
80%
and,
if
they
were
qualified
and
went
through
all
the
rigmarole
to
get
the
loan,
then
they
had
to
go
out
and
buy
one.
these
were
just
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
farmers
in
these
cases?
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
each
and
all
of
these
farmers
qualified.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
qualified
on
their
own.
they
had
to
do
that
first.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
only
place
neifert-white
comes
in
is
that
--
it's
provided
in
the
regulations
that
the
farmer,
in
connection
with
his
application,
must
submit
an
invoice
showing
the
price
of
the
bins,
price
of
the
product
that
he
buys,
and
that's
what
neifert-white.
they
put
in
a
statement
based
on
the
butler
list
price,
a
fair
trade
price,
fob
towns
in
montana.
the
actual
price
that
neifert-white
charged
the
bins
out
to
the
growers
was
somewhat
smaller.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
they're
on
from
$38.40
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
to
$366,
the
high
and
the
low
here.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that's
right.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
was
--
it
would
be
about
$120
invoice
price
and
the
farmer
paid
$100.
that
would
be
roughly
comparable.
we
believe
and
submit
to
this
court
that
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
one
not
only
consistent
with
cohn,
consistent
with
mcninch,
but
it's
consistent
with
all
of
the
cases
decided
because
--
and
cited
in
the
brief
because,
when
you
go
through
those
cases,
in
most
of
them
you
will
find
there
is
a
claim
situation.
us
v.
brown
is
an
example.
u.s.
v.
(inaudible).
there
--
that's
the
follow
up
of
the
mcninch
case
where
there
was
a
default
in
the
fha
loan
but,
there,
there's
no
discretion
in
the
government.
once
there's
a
default,
there's
a
demand
and
the
government
is
going
to
pay.
we
believe
that,
as
the
court
said
in
tieger,
that
--
the
circuit
court
said
in
tieger
and
quoted
in
mcninch,
that
normal
usage
of
the
language
that
when
you
have
a
claim
it's
a
demand
and,
when
you
demand,
you
have
a
right
to
get
it.
here,
that's
not
present.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
the
statute
and
the
regulations
authorized
the
making
of
the
loans.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
totally
discretionary
with
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
they
have
found
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i'm
sure
he
used
good
faith
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
in
the
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
certainly
it's
something
that
a
farmer,
if
he
were
denied,
could
not
seek
legal
redress.
that's
our
position.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
under
the
--
the
fact
that
the
filing
of
an
invoice
is
a
claim,
no,
sir.
we
–
it
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
that
situation
is
clearly
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
is
not
a
claim.
it
doesn't
come
within
the
definition
of
cohn.
we
don't
feel
it
comes
within
the
definition
of
any
of
these
other
cases.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
they
can
do
it
on
the
farmer's
past
growing
history,
his
need
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
you
have
--
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
so
far
as
i
can
read
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
they
would.
i
think
it
would
be
an
arbitrary
discretion
--
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
government's
power.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
all
i
--
as
i
read
the
regulations,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
could
grant
it
at
their
whim.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
no.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
the
committee
de
--
the
determination
is
a
committee
rather
than
an
official
and
they're
elected
by
the
farmers
themselves.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
i
would
not
believe
so.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
but,
i
--
from
the
regulations
and
the
statute,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
have
--
they
do
have
the
right
to
deny.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
and,
i
again
point
out
that
we
concur
on
the
government's
concession
on
this
point,
as
did
the
circuit
court,
that
there
was
no
legal
obligation.
the
government
contends
in
brief
at
some
length
that
this,
of
course,
is
an
open
door
in
connection
with
all
of
their
programs.
i
think
the
cases
cited
in
all
of
the
circumstances
under
false
claim
reflect
how
the
variances
occur
between
programs,
whether
there
is
a
claim
situation
or
not.
and
i
don't
certainly
--
personally
have
facts
of
all
of
these
programs
where
you
could
--
where
i
could
differentiate
them.
i
think
it's
something
that
will
have
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
because
i
think
each
program
is
in
fact
different.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
would
say
no.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
because
it's
basically
what
happened
here.

situation
because

mr.

at
that
time,
he'd
be

mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
we
believe
that,
certainly,
this
situation
is
narrowly
squarely
within
cohn.
that
test
has
to
be
observed
but,
as
pointed
out
in
mcninch,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
essentially
a
criminal
statute
and,
as
this
court
said
in
mcninch,
its
provisions
must
be
carefully
restricted.
and,
as
the
court
also
observed
in
mcninch,
it's
not
designed
to
reach
every
fraud
perpetrated
upon
the
government,
and
the
cohn
definition
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
circuit
court
decision
has
been
the
accepted
definition
in
all
of
the
false
claims
decisions
since
1926.
the
government's
open
door
argument,
i
think,
should
properly
be
addressed
to
congress
rather
than
to
the
court
if
the
government
in
fact,
in
the
proliferation
of
government
programs,
needs
additional
sanctions
which
they
can
impose
civilly.
certainly,
it
would
be
relatively
easy
to
do
so
in
connection
with
the
legislation
enacting
the
programs
and
as
we
have
discussed
before,
they
have
the
criminal
provisions.
the
criminal
provisions
have
been
criminally
enforced
against
neifert-white
here.
we
believe
that,
just
as
in
mcninch
and
tieger
where
the
government
sought
to
extend
the
provisions
of
the
act
beyond
a
historic
definition
of
cohn,
beyond
the
purpose
of
congress,
the
courts
said
“no,
we'll
not
go
that
far.
it
is
not
designed
to
reach
every
fraud.”
this
court
should
likewise
reach
the
same
result
and
affirm
the
circuit
court
opinion.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
to
prevent
the
plundering
of
the
treasury.
this
statute
came
out
of
the
civil
war
and
apparently,
there
was
a
horrendous
and
widespread
raid
on
the
treasury.
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
shows
just
that
plundering
a
financial
outcome,
the
government
being
defrauded,
payment
of
money
is
on
an
assertation
of
right.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
well,
there,
again
the
government
never
lost
a
nickel
in
this
situation.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
it
would
only
result
if
there
was
a
breakdown
on
the
local
level
where
they
did
not
get
adequate
security.
it's
the
only
way
it
could
result
in
that.
here,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
government
only
loaned,
in
one
case,
$38
more
than
they
should've
on
a
$400
loan.
these
are
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
minor
amount
of
money.
in
our
view,
it
is
not
in
any
sense
a
plunder
situation.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
hooks
no,
your
honor,
but
i
expressed
those
figures
because
it
does
not,
with
a
security,
seem
to
us
it
is
a
plunder
situation
that
was
contemplated
by
the
enactors
of
the
false
claims
act
in
1863.
thank
you
very
much.
