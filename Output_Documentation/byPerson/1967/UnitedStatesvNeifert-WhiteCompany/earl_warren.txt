what
were
the
charges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
charges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
wouldn't
have
been
eligible
at
all
unless
he'd
have
the
units
or
whatever
it
was
that
they
falsely
represent
his
entitled
to,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
farmer.
he'd
have
to
have
the
units,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
he
qualified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
qualified
on
his
false
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
if
he
hadn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
on
the
question
of
discretion
that
if
two
farmers
come
in
and
have
identical
--
make
identical
representations
on
the
identical
set
of
facts
that
they
have
the
discretion
to
make
a
loan
to
one
and
not
to
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
on
what
basis
do
they
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
they
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
saying,
on
the
identical
set
of
facts.
on
the
identical
set
of
facts,
can
they
--
do
they
have
discretion
to
give
it
to
one
and
deny
it
to
another?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
wouldn't
be
illegal
if
it
were
exercised
with
them,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
certainly,
these
programs
are
not
for
the
purpose
of
letting
some
minor
official
pick
and
choose
among
his
friends
whom
you'll
give
the
benefits
of
the
act
to,
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure,
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
just
pick
and
choose
who
they
want
to
give
the
right
to,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
want
--
all
i
was
interested
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
i
have
some
discretion
under
that
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
will
help
us
in
determining
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
became
common
practice
to
what
these
petitioners
did
in
this
case
or
the
respondents
read
it.
it
would
result
to
a
plundering
of
the
treasury,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
on
this
deal
but,
to
everybody,
it
had
gotten
into
the
habit
of
making
those
false
inventories
in
order
to
get
bones
that
would
eventually
result
in
all
probability,
will
it
not,
the
plundering
of
the
treasury?
