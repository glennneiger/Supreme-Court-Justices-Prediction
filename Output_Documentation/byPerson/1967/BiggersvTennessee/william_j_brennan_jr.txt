incident?
justice
william
j.

and
what
was
the
period
over
which
she
was
shown

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
the
record
does
show,
you're
saying
that
none
of
the
confrontation
whether
by
photograph
or
otherwise,
until
she
identified
this
petitioner,
was
this
petitioner
--?

justice
william
j.
brennan,

it's
january,

--
what
she

saying
was
before

ever
been
in
my
house
i
really
don't
recall
it,”
was
that
what

don't
why

really.
justice

do
you

like
the
assailant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

she

of
any
assailant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
