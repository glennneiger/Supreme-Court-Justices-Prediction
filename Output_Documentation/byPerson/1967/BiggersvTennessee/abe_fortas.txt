justice
abe
fortas
did
the
police
show
this
woman
other
pictures
at
various
times
and
with
result
that
she
failed
or
refused
to
identify
any
of
the
other
pictures
as
her
assailant?
justice
abe
fortas
prior
to
the
time
when
she
was
shown
the
batch
of
photographs
that
included
the
petitioner?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
in
any
event
she
was
shown
some
photographs
of
some
people
and
she
failed
or
refused
to
identify
any
one
of
them
as
the,
her
assailant?
justice
abe
fortas
well
here
is
that
--
you
don't
really
read
that
part
of
the
transcript
to
indicate
you
--
that
was
testimony
that
she
didn't
recognize
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no.
things
that
don't
count,
don't
count.
justice
abe
fortas
first
--
what
do
you
suppose
she
understood
this
question
to
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
where's
the
other
place?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
saying,
in
context,
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
i'm
wrong
that
mrs.
beamer
was
saying
that
in
between
the
time
of
the
assault
upon
her
and
the
trial,
she
had
not
seen
the
defendant.
otherwise
the
whole
thing
is
nonsense.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wasn't
she
a
licensed
practical
nurse?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
there
had
been
a
line
up,
a
proper
line
up
in
all
respects
and
that
every
person
in
the
lineup
had
said
these
words,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you?”
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
make
no
point
about
the
requiring
the
petitioner
to
say
these
words
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
confrontation
was
a
single
and
rather
than
in
a
lineup?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
it,
but
i'm
asking
what
your
position
is?
in
your
last
statement
i
thought
you
said,
was
to
the
effect
that
if
these
words
had
been
stated
in
a
line-up,
then
you
wouldn't
have
a
fifth
amendment
point?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
are
saying
that
it
was
a
coupling
only
and
only
the
coupling
of
a
single
confrontation
with
the
utterance
of
the
words
of
the
assailant
that
create
the
fifth
amendment
problem
here?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
this
procedure
was
preferable
to
a
lineup
then?
do
you
think
a
16-year
old
boy
was
given
an
advantage
by
being
taken
alone
of
the
doorway
of
this
room
and
then
he
could
with
the
wisdom
that
we
all
know
as
characteristic
of
16-year
old
boys
that
wisdom
and
self
possession,
observe
what
was
going
on
and
later
give
his
counsel
an
account
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
didn't
they
put
him
in
lineup?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
reason
in
the
record
here
why
they
didn't
put
him
in
line?
justice
abe
fortas
does
this
record
show
that
she
was
confronted
by
anybody
else,
any
other
suspect?
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
show
that
she
was
confronted
by
several
different
people
or
show
--
or
does
it
--
or
may
have
not
been
that
she
was
shown
that
pictures?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
she
was
shown
other
living
people
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
other
than
this
16
year
old
boy?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
lineup
customarily
used
in
nashville?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
police
show
this
woman
other
pictures
at
various
times
and
