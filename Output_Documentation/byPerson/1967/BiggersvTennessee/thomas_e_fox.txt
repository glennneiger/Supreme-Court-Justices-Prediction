mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
don't
think
that
i
am
too
much
in
disagreement
with
opposing
counsel
with
respect
to
the
facts
as
shown
by
record
or
with
respect
to
what
the
law
is.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
inferences
to
be
drawn
from,
i
think
i'd
draw
different
inferences
from
these,
from
the
record
from
what
opposing
counsel
did
and
it
maybe
that
i
have
looked
at
the
law
a
little
bit
different
in
this
respect.
in
stovall
as
i
understand
it
the
question
is
and
i
think
that's
question
to
be
determined,
the
only
question
to
be
determined
here
is
whether
or
not
the
identification
proceedings
were
such
as
are
–
were
so
unfair
as
to
amount
to
the
denial
of
due
process.
now
what
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process
i
think
in
any
given
case
depends
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
one
of
his
cases,
it's
a
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
versus
mcgrath,
reported
in
341
u.s.
123;
he
said,
“you
weigh
the
hurt
against
the
good
that's
to
be
done.”
in
other
cases,
i'll
cite
another
case
–-
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
said
in
determining
what
amounted
to
due
process
was
a
weighing
of
the
good
--
of
the
hurt
against
the
good
to
be
done.
that's
not
the
whole
excerpt
that
i
have
in
my
brief,
but
i
think
that
summarizes
it
pretty
well.
well
in
these
circumstances
are
in
stovall
case,
the
good
to
be
done
in
that
case
was
that
here
was
the
victim,
the
only
person
that
could
identify
the
defendant,
she
was
not
expected
to
delay.
i
don't
what
her
condition
of
mind
was
at
that
particular
time
but
it
seemingly
might
not
have
been
or
its
possibility,
i'll
say
you
that,
that
it
was
not
as
good
as
if
she
had
not
been
expected
or
if
she
had
been
expected
to
delay
them.
but
under
those
circumstances
the
suspect
or
the
accused
was
carried
to
the
hospital
by
himself
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
because
of
the
circumstances
it
was
imperative
that
the
identification
be
made
under
those
circumstances
that
was
not
--
then
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
in
this
case
the
circumstances
were
different
but
i
think
in
line
with
the
same
rule
of
law,
mrs.
beamer
had
over
the
time
and
i
don't
know
how
often
it
occurred
or
how
regular,
but
she
had
identified
to
the
state
by
opposing
counsel
she
had
looked
at,
she
had
looked
at
30
or
40
photographs,
none
of
them
were
the
defendant,
she
said
and
i
have
an
explanation
for
that.
that
is
he
didn't
have
it,
he
had
no
police
record,
he
had
no,
the
police
had
no
photographs
of
him.
she
looked
at
several
people
during
that
time,
didn't
say
how
often
or
how
regular
but
during
--
from
january
22
to
august
17,
she
looked
at
several
people
none
of
them
were
the
man
that
she
--
the
man
that
attacked
her
or
she
didn't
identify
any
as
the
man
who
attacked
her.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
taken
into
custody
by
the
police.
that
i
think
shows
the
reliability
of
her
testimony
but
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
make,
over
this
period
of
time
i
think
the
police
had
decided
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
is
impossibility
to
have
a
lineup
and
counsel
opponent
for
ever
person
that
ms.
beamer
might,
that
might
be
a
suspect.
i
think
they
--
i
believe
from
one
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
record
is
that
that
they
really
had
given
up
on
finding
the
person
who
raped
ms.
beamer.
since
that
is
a
case
and
since
this
investigation
was
continuing
over
long
period
of
time
i
think
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
made
it
impossible,
and
seemed
to
me
like
not
warranted
in
going
through
all
the
procedure
that
you'd
go
through
in
identifying
a
hot
prospect
immediately
after
the
incident
occurred.
i
think
it
had
become
obvious
to
the
police
by
this
time
that
ms.
beamer
if
she
was
emotionally
upset,
and
i
suggest
in
my
brief
that
she
was,
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
that
indicates
that
she
was
upset,
she
was
frightened
by
the
time,
but
over
a
period
of
seven
months.
she
had
looked
at
several
pictures,
she
had
seen
several,
she
had
looked
at
30
or
40
pictures,
she
had
seen
several
people.
it
became
obvious
that
she
wouldn't
quit
to
identify
people
who
are
not
guilty.
she
said
that
she
–
of
the
photographs
she
saw
one
photograph
that
the
person
or
–
that
had
features
like
the
defendant.
so
it
appears
that
she
was
being
very
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
like
the
assailant,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
well
i
think
that
the
record
indicates
that
she
did.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
that
she
did
say
something
about
it
and
i'm
not
speaking
--
what
the
printed
record
said
as
stated
by
my
opposing
counsel
but
i
think
from
the
inferences,
we
can
say
that
she
did
say
something
about
him.
the
police,
one
of
them
testified
that
she
did
give
a
description,
nothing
was
asked
about
what
she
said
in
that
description.
but
she
said
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
a
while
ago
that
his
hair
was
longer
at
the
time
she
was
assaulted
than
it
was
at
the
identification
or
during
the
trial,
now
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
that's
i
think
no
question
about
it,
that's
clear
in
the
record.
that
is
saying
her
identification
prior
to
the
lineup
or
identification
given
at
trial
prior
to
lineup,
she's
saying,
“he
looks
like
he
does
now
except
his
hair
was
shorter
i
believe
it
was
at
time
the
incident
occurred.”
she
also
said
this,
she
said
that,
“his
shirt
was
open
when
he
got
on
top
of
me
i
could
see
that
he
had
--
i
could
tell
or
he
had
a
big
flabby
breast
and
that
he
had
a
fat
abdomen.”
now,
nobody
disputed
that,
this
was
seven
months
prior
to
the
time
of
the
trial
if
the
defendant
didn't
meet
that
description
at
that
time,
he
would,
he
had
been
given
notice
or
she
had
testified
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
refute
that
kind
of
evidence.
so
i
think
she
did
yield
considerable
evidence
about
what
he
looked
like
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
she
also
said
his
voice,
that
she
had
some
teenage
boys
and
that
his
voice
sounded
considerably
like
those
boys.
now,
here
is
a
point
i
want
to
make.
after
she
saw
the
defendant
and
i
say
in
my
brief
that
circumstance
were
limited,
they're
always
limited
to
some
extent,
in
this
advancement,
she
said,
she
has
never
seen
him
before
the
attack,
she
didn't
see
him
between
the
time
of
attack,
then
the
arrest,
and
the
arrest
until
she
got
down
to
police
headquarters.
but
she
said
there
was
light
only
in
the
hall,
he
threw
her
down
in
the
hallway
of
her
home
i
believe.
she
said
that
she
looked
up
into
his
face,
she
saw
him,
she
saw
him
in
the
home
too.
it's
not
clear
just
how
much
she
saw
him.
it
looks
like
the
daughter
might
have
had
--
does
not,
have
got
an
opportunity
to
see
him
as
ms.
beamer,
the
daughter
said
she
couldn't
identify
him
but
i
won't
say
--
daughter
did
relate
some
circumstances
about
his
appearance
that
corroborated
what
her
mother
had
said
about.
but
after
she
saw
him
at
the
police
headquarters
and
incidentally
one
of
the
policemen
said,
there
were
five
policemen
present,
the
defendant
said
in
the
room
where
he
was
identified
there
were
two
policemen
ms.
beamer
and
another
woman.
now
that's
i
think
an
important
point.
it's
argued
that
with
five
policemen
present
that
that
of
itself
suggested
maybe
ms.
beamer
wouldn't,
didn't
feel
to
free
speak
up.
well,
i
think
what
the
policemen
say,
and
there
were
five
policemen
around
the
headquarters,
but
the
defendant's
testimony
is
there
were
two
policemen
in
the
room
where
the
identification
took
place,
ms.
beamer
and
another
woman.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
how
many?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
can't
answer
it.
there's
one
police
officer
that
really
testified
to
it
and
i
think
that
maybe
that
might
have
been
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
as
far
as
i
remember
he
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
really
don't
know.
i
can't
--
that
was
question
i
didn't
anticipate.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
we
got
the
full
trial
record
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
i
think
i
can
find
out.
one
policeman
testified
that
i
think
at
length
about
what
took
place.
now,
there
were
some
others
that
maybe
had
something
to
say
but
i'm
just,
there's
officer
capet
that
really
related
to
the
circumstance
it
took
place,
the
others
didn't,
if
they
testified
and
i
think
they
did,
i
think
that
was
a
mistake,
it
wasn't
fully
as
officer
capet
testified.
now
after
she
saw
the
defendant,
she
still
didn't
say,
“this
is
him.”
she
said,
“let's
hear
him
talk.”
after
he
said
these
words
that
her
assailant
said
to
her,
she
said
that,
“this
is
the
man.”
now,
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
back
in
wade
and
gilbert
is
that
in
that,
the
type
of
lineup
that's
talked
about
there
the
defendant
–
he's
in
a
–
so
situated
that
he
can't
tell
what
goes
on.
he
don't
know
what
the
police
do
and
what
the
suggestive
gestures
are
made,
or
what
is
said,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
that
weren't
true
in
this
case.
this
defendant
was
in
the
room.
he
could
see
who
was
taken
part
in
his
identification,
and
what
was
done.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
possible
to
reconstruct
what
took
place
because
the
defendant
was
there
present
and
saw
it.
he
could
have
been
informed
his
counsel
as
to
what
took
place
and
counsel
wouldn't
have
–
had
cross-examine
in
the
dark,
as
suggested
in
some
of
the
other
--
in
gilbert
or
wade
i
forgot,
maybe
suggested
in
both
of
them,
that
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
think
he
had
been,
it
would
have
been
more
protective
if
he
had
been
placed
in
lineup
at
counsel
parade.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
think
the
inference
is
that
she
had
been
down
to
the
--
ms.
beamer
had
been
down
police
headquarters
so
many
times,
she
had
looked
at
so
many
people.
i
think
that
the
police
by
that
time
surely
decided
she's
going
to
be
cautious
since
she
has
identifying
anybody
until
real
person
comes
along
and
i
think
it,
i
think
it
would
have
involved
to
many
lineups
and
too
much
red
tape
if
the
court
pleased
to
kept
on
doing
this
every
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
this
record
shows
that
she
was
asked
to
identify
several
different
people
as
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you
but
she
was
shown
30,
40
different
pictures
to
identify.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
the
record
says
several,
the
record
says
several,
it
doesn't
say
how
many,
or
at
what
periods
of
time,
or
the
regularity,
or
anything.
so
i
think
that
perhaps
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
record
is
that
every
time,
the
policeman
found
somebody
that
had
raped
somebody
else
they'd
call
ms.
beamer
down
there
to
see,
“well
is
this
the
one
that
raped
you
and
she--”
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
would
think
so
if
the
court
please,
but
i
don't
know
the
record
doesn't
indicate
whether
it
is
or
not,
i
would
think
so.
i
think
the
reading
part
in
this
case
as
i
said
before
that
the
inference,
that
can
be
drawn
from
record
was
that
was
happening
so
often
and
no
result
that
they
--
it
just
got
to
be
a
matter
of
routine
and
made
the
option,
did
get
a
little
careless
about
that
thing.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
she
meant
by
that
this
particular
suspect
i
think
that
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
been
down
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
well.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
well
the
record
show
--
now
this
is
the
first
time
he
had
been
to
police
headquarters.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
this
is
the
first
time
she--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
yes
and
i
think
her
testimony
is
a
little
confusing,
maybe
she
didn't
understand
the
question
or
there's
good
bit,
this
was
a
pretty
heated
tried
lawsuit
and
there's
lots
of
controversy,
and
i
don't
think
she
understood.
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
police
headquarters
and
i
may
have
added
that
they
didn't
have
his
picture,
but
i
just
think
the
inference
to
be
drawn
is
if
he
hadn't
been
there,
if
they
haven't
arrested
him,
he
had
no
police
record,
they
didn't
have
any
pictures
to
show.
i
think
that
attempt
to
show
that
she
was
careful
and
that
she
had
time
to
cool
off.
i
know
what
mr.
walsh
(ph)
treat
his
own
eyewitness
identification,
he
says
the
length
of
time
is
the
matter
to
be
considered,
but
in
this
case,
i
think
that
that
was
favorable
to
the
state's
position
because
this
lady
had
taken
her
time,
she
had
cooled
off
and
had
made
it
evident
that
she
wasn't
desperate
to
identify
anybody.
she'll
just
wait
until
the
right
man
came
along.
now
her
daughter's
testimony,
her
daughter
couldn't
identify
the
assailant,
but
her
daughter
gave
this
same
description
of
him.
she
says
that
he
had
long
hair
--
she
had
--
that
he
was
large,
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
negro
race.
one
other
identifying
feature
that
her
mother
had
given,
i
have
forgotten
exactly
what
it
is,
i
have
got
the
citation
here
i
believe
on
page
83.
she
even
said
i
don't
know
if
this
is
material,
but
the
daughter
even
said
that
the
defendant
had
on
a
short
sleeve
shirt,
well
isn't
her
mother
testified
that?
that
may
not
be
material,
but
it
certainly
corroborates
to
some
extent
about
what
her
mother
had
to
say
about
him.
now
the
–
as
i
said
before,
i
know
it
would
have
been
some
protection
if
counsel
had
been
present,
but
the
purpose
of
having
counsel
there
is
have
to
reconstruct
what
happened,
the
arguments
made
because
this
is
a
boy
and
he
wouldn't
know
how
to
protect
himself
and
things
of
that
sort.
i
don't
really
think
that
enters
into
this
question
because
certainly
under
wade
and
gilbert,
there's
never
been
a
doubt
about
until
now.
a
defendant
can
be
made
to
testify
i
mean
make
the
statement
for
the
purpose
of
–
knowing
what
his
–
how
his
voice
sound,
but
i
don't
know
anything
that
counsel
could
have
done
if
it
had
been
there
except
to
reconstruct
circumstances
and
it
is
not
shown
that
the
defendant
was
handicapped
in
any
way.
he
was
16-year
old
boy,
but
i
don't
know
that
means
he
couldn't
have
been
as
observant
as
any,
as
an
adult
all
he
had
to
do
was,
he
was
panicked
and
could
recite
what
happened.
so
we
think
that
that
is
not
really
sufficient
to
say
that
it
amounts
to
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
because
the
counsel
weren't
apprised.
if
the
court
please
i
believe
that
just
about
finishes
my
presentation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
court
please,
the
record
doesn't
show,
and
some
argument
made
at
one
time
about
whether
or
not
he
was
got
propelled
over
from
the
juvenile
court
over
to
the
criminal
court,
but
that's
not
no
longer
in
the
case
so
far
as
i
understand
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
your
honor
please,
i
know
from
read
or
at
least
i
read
in
the
newspaper
that
there
was
other
charges
of
this
type
pending
against
him.
i
don't
know
that,
but
i
think
i
read
that
in
the
paper
and
i
think
that's
a
certainty.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
no
sir
i--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
do
not
know.
i
don't
have
any
knowledge
of
any
of
the
circumstances
or
how
many
other
cases
were
charged
against
him
other
than
one
for
that
particular
rape.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
not
very
much,
it's
a
little--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
alright,
i
don't
think
that
--
the
trial
judge
was
trying
desperately
to
keep
out
any
information
about
the
other
rapes.
on
cross-examination,
one
of
the
officers,
officer
capet
was
asked,
“well,
when
did
you
first
see
the
defendant?”
he
said,
over
at
a
particular
place
and
of
course
that
was
evident
that
it
was
where
he
was
arrested
in
the
other
case
and
that's
as
far
i
know
that's
about
as
much
as
ever
got
into
it.
it's
argued
by
opposing
counsel
that
is
enough
to
indicate
the
jury
there
was
another
case
pending
against
him
and
they
make
that
argument
to
sum
it
and
that
contains
its
own
doing
cross-examination,
but
that's
about
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
if
it
got
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
but
this
was
defendant's
counsel
bringing
that
out,
this
one
mistake.
defendant's
counsel
was
asking
these
questions
to
bring
that
out
in
itself.
the
trial
judge
was
trying
his
best
to
keep
it
out
and
the
district
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney
made
the
statement
that's
in
the
record
that
he
had
cautioned
the
witness.
i
don't
know,
this
must
not
been
for
the
jury,
but
he
had
cautioned
the
witness
not
to
mention
the
other
offense.
so
state,
the
prosecution,
and
the
court
had
made
some
effort
to
keep
this
out,
about
the
other
offenses.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir
i
can't
be
certain
on
this
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
it
ain't
dealt
in
this
record
and
it
is
still
a
charge
and
whether
it
still
a
charge
against
him
or
not
and
i
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know,
if
the
court
please,
the
opposing
counsel
may
have
some
information
to
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
depends
upon
her
identification.
let
me
say
this
on
his
examination
he
testified
and
his
mother
testified
to
some
circumstances
that
i
think
i
don't
know
what
the
inference
be
drawn
from
it
would
be,
but
i
certainly
think
he
heard
him
before
the
jury.
because
he
was
16
year
old
and
his
mother
said
that
when
she
went
in
and
she
called
back
--
in
one
place
i
think
she
said
about
every
hour
see
if
he
is
still
at
home.
he
testified
to
those
circumstances,
he
didn't
go
anywhere,
he
never
got
away
from
home,
and
then
it
develops,
and
this
came
from
one
of
the
defense
witnesses
that
when
his
mother
is
away
she
had
somebody
watching
him,
to
see
that
he
did
stay
at
home.
i
think
that
certainly
hurt
him
for
the
jury
and
i
don't
know
what
inference
could
be
drawn
from
it,
except
he
was
a
peculiar
sort
of
a
child,
that
he
was
a
sort
of
person
that
his
mother
had
somebody
watching.
i
think
it
certainly
she
would
have
been
afraid
if
a
16
year
old
boy
would
do
something
to
hurt
himself
that
it
--
to
like
a
jury
could
probably
infer
to
got
was
to
keep
him
from
getting
into
trouble
somewhere
and
he
was
the
most
peculiar
and
a
lone
type
boy,
that's
part
the
defense
proof
and
not
our
proof.
i
don't
know
that's
material
for
this
court
but
certainly
may
have
difference
with
the
jury
i
would
say.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
don't
think
that
i
am
too
much
in
disagreement
with
opposing
counsel
with
respect
to
the
facts
as
shown
by
record
or
with
respect
to
what
the
law
is.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
inferences
to
be
drawn
from,
i
think
i'd
draw
different
inferences
from
these,
from
the
record
from
what
opposing
counsel
did
and
it
maybe
that
i
have
looked
at
the
law
a
little
bit
different
in
this
respect.
in
stovall
as
i
understand
it
the
question
is
and
i
think
that's
question
to
be
determined,
the
only
question
to
be
determined
here
is
whether
or
not
the
identification
proceedings
were
such
as
are
–
were
so
unfair
as
to
amount
to
the
denial
of
due
process.
now
what
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process
i
think
in
any
given
case
depends
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
one
of
his
cases,
it's
a
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
versus
mcgrath,
reported
in
341
u.s.
123;
he
said,
“you
weigh
the
hurt
against
the
good
that's
to
be
done.”
in
other
cases,
i'll
cite
another
case
–-
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
said
in
determining
what
amounted
to
due
process
was
a
weighing
of
the
good
--
of
the
hurt
against
the
good
to
be
done.
that's
not
the
whole
excerpt
that
i
have
in
my
brief,
but
i
think
that
summarizes
it
pretty
well.
well
in
these
circumstances
are
in
stovall
case,
the
good
to
be
done
in
that
case
was
that
here
was
the
victim,
the
only
person
that
could
identify
the
defendant,
she
was
not
expected
to
delay.
i
don't
what
her
condition
of
mind
was
at
that
particular
time
but
it
seemingly
might
not
have
been
or
its
possibility,
i'll
say
you
that,
that
it
was
not
as
good
as
if
she
had
not
been
expected
or
if
she
had
been
expected
to
delay
them.
but
under
those
circumstances
the
suspect
or
the
accused
was
carried
to
the
hospital
by
himself
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
because
of
the
circumstances
it
was
imperative
that
the
identification
be
made
under
those
circumstances
that
was
not
--
then
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
in
this
case
the
circumstances
were
different
but
i
think
in
line
with
the
same
rule
of
law,
mrs.
beamer
had
over
the
time
and
i
don't
know
how
often
it
occurred
or
how
regular,
but
she
had
identified
to
the
state
by
opposing
counsel
she
had
looked
at,
she
had
looked
at
30
or
40
photographs,
none
of
them
were
the
defendant,
she
said
and
i
have
an
explanation
for
that.
that
is
he
didn't
have
it,
he
had
no
police
record,
he
had
no,
the
police
had
no
photographs
of
him.
she
looked
at
several
people
during
that
time,
didn't
say
how
often
or
how
regular
but
during
--
from
january
22
to
august
17,
she
looked
at
several
people
none
of
them
were
the
man
that
she
--
the
man
that
attacked
her
or
she
didn't
identify
any
as
the
man
who
attacked
her.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
taken
into
custody
by
the
police.
that
i
think
shows
the
reliability
of
her
testimony
but
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
make,
over
this
period
of
time
i
think
the
police
had
decided
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
is
impossibility
to
have
a
lineup
and
counsel
opponent
for
ever
person
that
ms.
beamer
might,
that
might
be
a
suspect.
i
think
they
--
i
believe
from
one
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
record
is
that
that
they
really
had
given
up
on
finding
the
person
who
raped
ms.
beamer.
since
that
is
a
case
and
since
this
investigation
was
continuing
over
long
period
of
time
i
think
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
made
it
impossible,
and
seemed
to
me
like
not
warranted
in
going
through
all
the
procedure
that
you'd
go
through
in
identifying
a
hot
prospect
immediately
after
the
incident
occurred.
i
think
it
had
become
obvious
to
the
police
by
this
time
that
ms.
beamer
if
she
was
emotionally
upset,
and
i
suggest
in
my
brief
that
she
was,
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
that
indicates
that
she
was
upset,
she
was
frightened
by
the
time,
but
over
a
period
of
seven
months.
she
had
looked
at
several
pictures,
she
had
seen
several,
she
had
looked
at
30
or
40
pictures,
she
had
seen
several
people.
it
became
obvious
that
she
wouldn't
quit
to
identify
people
who
are
not
guilty.
she
said
that
she
–
of
the
photographs
she
saw
one
photograph
that
the
person
or
–
that
had
features
like
the
defendant.
so
it
appears
that
she
was
being
very
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
like
the
assailant,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
well
i
think
that
the
record
indicates
that
she
did.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
that
she
did
say
something
about
it
and
i'm
not
speaking
--
what
the
printed
record
said
as
stated
by
my
opposing
counsel
but
i
think
from
the
inferences,
we
can
say
that
she
did
say
something
about
him.
the
police,
one
of
them
testified
that
she
did
give
a
description,
nothing
was
asked
about
what
she
said
in
that
description.
but
she
said
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
a
while
ago
that
his
hair
was
longer
at
the
time
she
was
assaulted
than
it
was
at
the
identification
or
during
the
trial,
now
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
that's
i
think
no
question
about
it,
that's
clear
in
the
record.
that
is
saying
her
identification
prior
to
the
lineup
or
identification
given
at
trial
prior
to
lineup,
she's
saying,
“he
looks
like
he
does
now
except
his
hair
was
shorter
i
believe
it
was
at
time
the
incident
occurred.”
she
also
said
this,
she
said
that,
“his
shirt
was
open
when
he
got
on
top
of
me
i
could
see
that
he
had
--
i
could
tell
or
he
had
a
big
flabby
breast
and
that
he
had
a
fat
abdomen.”
now,
nobody
disputed
that,
this
was
seven
months
prior
to
the
time
of
the
trial
if
the
defendant
didn't
meet
that
description
at
that
time,
he
would,
he
had
been
given
notice
or
she
had
testified
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
refute
that
kind
of
evidence.
so
i
think
she
did
yield
considerable
evidence
about
what
he
looked
like
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
she
also
said
his
voice,
that
she
had
some
teenage
boys
and
that
his
voice
sounded
considerably
like
those
boys.
now,
here
is
a
point
i
want
to
make.
after
she
saw
the
defendant
and
i
say
in
my
brief
that
circumstance
were
limited,
they're
always
limited
to
some
extent,
in
this
advancement,
she
said,
she
has
never
seen
him
before
the
attack,
she
didn't
see
him
between
the
time
of
attack,
then
the
arrest,
and
the
arrest
until
she
got
down
to
police
headquarters.
but
she
said
there
was
light
only
in
the
hall,
he
threw
her
down
in
the
hallway
of
her
home
i
believe.
she
said
that
she
looked
up
into
his
face,
she
saw
him,
she
saw
him
in
the
home
too.
it's
not
clear
just
how
much
she
saw
him.
it
looks
like
the
daughter
might
have
had
--
does
not,
have
got
an
opportunity
to
see
him
as
ms.
beamer,
the
daughter
said
she
couldn't
identify
him
but
i
won't
say
--
daughter
did
relate
some
circumstances
about
his
appearance
that
corroborated
what
her
mother
had
said
about.
but
after
she
saw
him
at
the
police
headquarters
and
incidentally
one
of
the
policemen
said,
there
were
five
policemen
present,
the
defendant
said
in
the
room
where
he
was
identified
there
were
two
policemen
ms.
beamer
and
another
woman.
now
that's
i
think
an
important
point.
it's
argued
that
with
five
policemen
present
that
that
of
itself
suggested
maybe
ms.
beamer
wouldn't,
didn't
feel
to
free
speak
up.
well,
i
think
what
the
policemen
say,
and
there
were
five
policemen
around
the
headquarters,
but
the
defendant's
testimony
is
there
were
two
policemen
in
the
room
where
the
identification
took
place,
ms.
beamer
and
another
woman.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
how
many?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
can't
answer
it.
there's
one
police
officer
that
really
testified
to
it
and
i
think
that
maybe
that
might
have
been
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
as
far
as
i
remember
he
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
really
don't
know.
i
can't
--
that
was
question
i
didn't
anticipate.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
we
got
the
full
trial
record
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
i
think
i
can
find
out.
one
policeman
testified
that
i
think
at
length
about
what
took
place.
now,
there
were
some
others
that
maybe
had
something
to
say
but
i'm
just,
there's
officer
capet
that
really
related
to
the
circumstance
it
took
place,
the
others
didn't,
if
they
testified
and
i
think
they
did,
i
think
that
was
a
mistake,
it
wasn't
fully
as
officer
capet
testified.
now
after
she
saw
the
defendant,
she
still
didn't
say,
“this
is
him.”
she
said,
“let's
hear
him
talk.”
after
he
said
these
words
that
her
assailant
said
to
her,
she
said
that,
“this
is
the
man.”
now,
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
back
in
wade
and
gilbert
is
that
in
that,
the
type
of
lineup
that's
talked
about
there
the
defendant
–
he's
in
a
–
so
situated
that
he
can't
tell
what
goes
on.
he
don't
know
what
the
police
do
and
what
the
suggestive
gestures
are
made,
or
what
is
said,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
that
weren't
true
in
this
case.
this
defendant
was
in
the
room.
he
could
see
who
was
taken
part
in
his
identification,
and
what
was
done.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
possible
to
reconstruct
what
took
place
because
the
defendant
was
there
present
and
saw
it.
he
could
have
been
informed
his
counsel
as
to
what
took
place
and
counsel
wouldn't
have
–
had
cross-examine
in
the
dark,
as
suggested
in
some
of
the
other
--
in
gilbert
or
wade
i
forgot,
maybe
suggested
in
both
of
them,
that
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
think
he
had
been,
it
would
have
been
more
protective
if
he
had
been
placed
in
lineup
at
counsel
parade.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
think
the
inference
is
that
she
had
been
down
to
the
--
ms.
beamer
had
been
down
police
headquarters
so
many
times,
she
had
looked
at
so
many
people.
i
think
that
the
police
by
that
time
surely
decided
she's
going
to
be
cautious
since
she
has
identifying
anybody
until
real
person
comes
along
and
i
think
it,
i
think
it
would
have
involved
to
many
lineups
and
too
much
red
tape
if
the
court
pleased
to
kept
on
doing
this
every
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
this
record
shows
that
she
was
asked
to
identify
several
different
people
as
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you
but
she
was
shown
30,
40
different
pictures
to
identify.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
the
record
says
several,
the
record
says
several,
it
doesn't
say
how
many,
or
at
what
periods
of
time,
or
the
regularity,
or
anything.
so
i
think
that
perhaps
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
record
is
that
every
time,
the
policeman
found
somebody
that
had
raped
somebody
else
they'd
call
ms.
beamer
down
there
to
see,
“well
is
this
the
one
that
raped
you
and
she--”
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
would
think
so
if
the
court
please,
but
i
don't
know
the
record
doesn't
indicate
whether
it
is
or
not,
i
would
think
so.
i
think
the
reading
part
in
this
case
as
i
said
before
that
the
inference,
that
can
be
drawn
from
record
was
that
was
happening
so
often
and
no
result
that
they
--
it
just
got
to
be
a
matter
of
routine
and
made
the
option,
did
get
a
little
careless
about
that
thing.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
she
meant
by
that
this
particular
suspect
i
think
that
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
been
down
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
well.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
well
the
record
show
--
now
this
is
the
first
time
he
had
been
to
police
headquarters.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
this
is
the
first
time
she--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
yes
and
i
think
her
testimony
is
a
little
confusing,
maybe
she
didn't
understand
the
question
or
there's
good
bit,
this
was
a
pretty
heated
tried
lawsuit
and
there's
lots
of
controversy,
and
i
don't
think
she
understood.
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
police
headquarters
and
i
may
have
added
that
they
didn't
have
his
picture,
but
i
just
think
the
inference
to
be
drawn
is
if
he
hadn't
been
there,
if
they
haven't
arrested
him,
he
had
no
police
record,
they
didn't
have
any
pictures
to
show.
i
think
that
attempt
to
show
that
she
was
careful
and
that
she
had
time
to
cool
off.
i
know
what
mr.
walsh
(ph)
treat
his
own
eyewitness
identification,
he
says
the
length
of
time
is
the
matter
to
be
considered,
but
in
this
case,
i
think
that
that
was
favorable
to
the
state's
position
because
this
lady
had
taken
her
time,
she
had
cooled
off
and
had
made
it
evident
that
she
wasn't
desperate
to
identify
anybody.
she'll
just
wait
until
the
right
man
came
along.
now
her
daughter's
testimony,
her
daughter
couldn't
identify
the
assailant,
but
her
daughter
gave
this
same
description
of
him.
she
says
that
he
had
long
hair
--
she
had
--
that
he
was
large,
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
negro
race.
one
other
identifying
feature
that
her
mother
had
given,
i
have
forgotten
exactly
what
it
is,
i
have
got
the
citation
here
i
believe
on
page
83.
she
even
said
i
don't
know
if
this
is
material,
but
the
daughter
even
said
that
the
defendant
had
on
a
short
sleeve
shirt,
well
isn't
her
mother
testified
that?
that
may
not
be
material,
but
it
certainly
corroborates
to
some
extent
about
what
her
mother
had
to
say
about
him.
now
the
–
as
i
said
before,
i
know
it
would
have
been
some
protection
if
counsel
had
been
present,
but
the
purpose
of
having
counsel
there
is
have
to
reconstruct
what
happened,
the
arguments
made
because
this
is
a
boy
and
he
wouldn't
know
how
to
protect
himself
and
things
of
that
sort.
i
don't
really
think
that
enters
into
this
question
because
certainly
under
wade
and
gilbert,
there's
never
been
a
doubt
about
until
now.
a
defendant
can
be
made
to
testify
i
mean
make
the
statement
for
the
purpose
of
–
knowing
what
his
–
how
his
voice
sound,
but
i
don't
know
anything
that
counsel
could
have
done
if
it
had
been
there
except
to
reconstruct
circumstances
and
it
is
not
shown
that
the
defendant
was
handicapped
in
any
way.
he
was
16-year
old
boy,
but
i
don't
know
that
means
he
couldn't
have
been
as
observant
as
any,
as
an
adult
all
he
had
to
do
was,
he
was
panicked
and
could
recite
what
happened.
so
we
think
that
that
is
not
really
sufficient
to
say
that
it
amounts
to
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
because
the
counsel
weren't
apprised.
if
the
court
please
i
believe
that
just
about
finishes
my
presentation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
court
please,
the
record
doesn't
show,
and
some
argument
made
at
one
time
about
whether
or
not
he
was
got
propelled
over
from
the
juvenile
court
over
to
the
criminal
court,
but
that's
not
no
longer
in
the
case
so
far
as
i
understand
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
your
honor
please,
i
know
from
read
or
at
least
i
read
in
the
newspaper
that
there
was
other
charges
of
this
type
pending
against
him.
i
don't
know
that,
but
i
think
i
read
that
in
the
paper
and
i
think
that's
a
certainty.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
no
sir
i--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
do
not
know.
i
don't
have
any
knowledge
of
any
of
the
circumstances
or
how
many
other
cases
were
charged
against
him
other
than
one
for
that
particular
rape.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
not
very
much,
it's
a
little--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
alright,
i
don't
think
that
--
the
trial
judge
was
trying
desperately
to
keep
out
any
information
about
the
other
rapes.
on
cross-examination,
one
of
the
officers,
officer
capet
was
asked,
“well,
when
did
you
first
see
the
defendant?”
he
said,
over
at
a
particular
place
and
of
course
that
was
evident
that
it
was
where
he
was
arrested
in
the
other
case
and
that's
as
far
i
know
that's
about
as
much
as
ever
got
into
it.
it's
argued
by
opposing
counsel
that
is
enough
to
indicate
the
jury
there
was
another
case
pending
against
him
and
they
make
that
argument
to
sum
it
and
that
contains
its
own
doing
cross-examination,
but
that's
about
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
if
it
got
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
but
this
was
defendant's
counsel
bringing
that
out,
this
one
mistake.
defendant's
counsel
was
asking
these
questions
to
bring
that
out
in
itself.
the
trial
judge
was
trying
his
best
to
keep
it
out
and
the
district
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney
made
the
statement
that's
in
the
record
that
he
had
cautioned
the
witness.
i
don't
know,
this
must
not
been
for
the
jury,
but
he
had
cautioned
the
witness
not
to
mention
the
other
offense.
so
state,
the
prosecution,
and
the
court
had
made
some
effort
to
keep
this
out,
about
the
other
offenses.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir
i
can't
be
certain
on
this
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
it
ain't
dealt
in
this
record
and
it
is
still
a
charge
and
whether
it
still
a
charge
against
him
or
not
and
i
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know,
if
the
court
please,
the
opposing
counsel
may
have
some
information
to
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
depends
upon
her
identification.
let
me
say
this
on
his
examination
he
testified
and
his
mother
testified
to
some
circumstances
that
i
think
i
don't
know
what
the
inference
be
drawn
from
it
would
be,
but
i
certainly
think
he
heard
him
before
the
jury.
because
he
was
16
year
old
and
his
mother
said
that
when
she
went
in
and
she
called
back
--
in
one
place
i
think
she
said
about
every
hour
see
if
he
is
still
at
home.
he
testified
to
those
circumstances,
he
didn't
go
anywhere,
he
never
got
away
from
home,
and
then
it
develops,
and
this
came
from
one
of
the
defense
witnesses
that
when
his
mother
is
away
she
had
somebody
watching
him,
to
see
that
he
did
stay
at
home.
i
think
that
certainly
hurt
him
for
the
jury
and
i
don't
know
what
inference
could
be
drawn
from
it,
except
he
was
a
peculiar
sort
of
a
child,
that
he
was
a
sort
of
person
that
his
mother
had
somebody
watching.
i
think
it
certainly
she
would
have
been
afraid
if
a
16
year
old
boy
would
do
something
to
hurt
himself
that
it
--
to
like
a
jury
could
probably
infer
to
got
was
to
keep
him
from
getting
into
trouble
somewhere
and
he
was
the
most
peculiar
and
a
lone
type
boy,
that's
part
the
defense
proof
and
not
our
proof.
i
don't
know
that's
material
for
this
court
but
certainly
may
have
difference
with
the
jury
i
would
say.
