mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
to
review
a
16-year
old
boy’s
conviction
and
sentenced
to
20
years
in
prison
for
the
crime
of
rape.
because
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
total
circumstances
surrounding
petitioner's
identification
and
its
use
at
trial
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
intend
to
state
the
facts
in
some
detail.
on
the
night
of
january
22,
1965
mrs.
margaret
beamer,
a
negro
nurse
was
sewing
in
the
living
room
of
her
nashville,
tennessee
home.
her
12-year
old
daughter
was
in
a
bedroom,
listening
to
phonograph
records
and
a
six-year
old
son
was
asleep
in
another
bedroom.
the
living
room
was
a
lit
by
a
single
lamp
and
the
lights
were
off
in
an
adjoining
hallway
and
kitchen.
at
about
9:10
pm
mrs.
beamer
rose
and
entered
this
hallway.
she
was
grabbed
from
behind
and
pushed
to
the
floor
by
an
intruder
holding
a
long
butcher
knife.
she
began
to
scream
and
sob,
and
her
12-year
old
daughter
came
to
the
door
of
the
adjacent
bedroom
and
also
began
to
scream
when
she
saw
her
mother
and
the
assailant.
intruder
then
said,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you
both,
to
the
women,”
and
he
had
mrs.
beamer
order
her
daughter
back
into
the
bedroom.
he
then
forced
her
to
walk
through
an
unlit
kitchen,
out
behind
the
house
up
in
an
embankment
to
some
railroads
tracks
and
took
her
to
a
place
in
the
woods
where
he
raped
her.
the
only
light
behind
the
house
came
from
the
moon,
streetlights
which
were
located
in
front
of
the
house;
there
were
no
lights
on
the
tracks.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
place
it
does
is
in
newspaper
story
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
prosecution,
and
i
believe
she
is
39
from
that
story.
these
events
lasted
from
10
to
30
minutes
at
the
most
and
mrs.
beamer
testified
that
throughout
she
was
frightened
in
fear
and
crying.
after
the
rape,
the
rapist
ran
away
and
mrs.
beamer
reported
the
crime
to
the
police.
after
she
did
this
at
dates
and
times
and
under
circumstances
which
the
record
does
not
particularly
reveal,
she
was
shown
30
or
40
photographs
from
police
files
and
saw
a
several
suspects
at
headquarters.
however,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
she
never
was
shown
the
petitioner
in
this
case
at
these
viewings.
mr.
michael
meltsner
date
of
the
incident
was
january
22,
1965.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
record
does
not
say.
she
was
shown
these
photographs,
but
at
no
time
did
the
state
introduce
evidence,
showing
the
dates,
how
long
over
the
period
of
time
between
the
crime
and
the
eventual
identification
proceeding.
mr.
michael
meltsner
quite
clearly,
she
was
asked
at
one
point,
did
you
know
who
raped
you
before
the
pretrial
identification.
she
said
no.
a
police
officer
testified
that
he
had
never
shown
photographs
of
the
petitioner
to
her,
the
petitioner
took
the
stand,
was
not
cross-examined
about
a
criminal
record.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
that
took
place,
that
took
place
seven
months
later.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
august
of
1965.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
was
shown
some
30
or
40
photographs.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
the
photographs
she
was
shown
did
not
include
the
petitioner.
she
was
shown
30
or
40
photographs
from
police
files,
she
was
never
shown
a
picture
of
the
petitioner.
the
record
does
not
show
whether
she
saw
these
photographs
a
day
after
the
crime
or
a
week
after
the
crime,
although
i
must
confess
my
reading
of
the
record,
it
certainly
seems
to
be
that
way.
that's
the
impression,
but
certainly
the
record
does,
is
really
--
is
not
clear
on
this
point.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
did
see
one
person
who
she
said
had
features
like
the
rapist,
but
other
than
that
she
identified,
i
mean
she
saw
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
a
direct
viewing
or
through
a
photograph
as
i
recall.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
said
that
one
person
had
features
like
the
rapist.
now,
when
she
gave
a
description
to
the
police
at
the
time
the
crime
was
reported,
a
police
officer
wrote
down
what
she
said
and
he
described
it
as,
“she
told
me
as
best
she
could,”
and
he
wrote
it
down
and
this
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
state
never
offered
this
contemporaneous
description
or
the
record
of
it
into
evidence
at
the
trial
nor
did
mrs.
beamer
ever
testify
as
to
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
she
talked
totally
in
terms
of
the
pretrial
identification,
almost
totally.
she
never
referred
back
to
the
crime.
mr.
michael
meltsner
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
she
didn't
identify
him
until
he
spoke.
he
was
called
into
a
room.
she
was
sitting
there
with
five
police
officers
but
there
was
no
lone
up
and
she
then
requested
the
police
to
have
him
speak
and
she
said,
have
him
say,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you,”
and
the
police
officer
said
say
it,
say
it
boy,
and
he
hesitated.
and
he
said,
say
it
and
then
the
petitioner
said,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
16.
mr.
michael
meltsner
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
to
answer
the
question
you
asked,
before
the
recess
mr.
chief
justice,
at
trial
a
police
officer
revealed
that
a
written
report
of
mrs.
beamer's
description
had
been
taken
down
at
the
time
she
reported
the
crime,
but
the
state
never
offered
this
description
into
evidence
nor
did
mrs.
beamer
testify
about
the
character
of
her
initial
description.
now,
seven
months
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
thing
on
the
record
is
that
a
description
was
taken
down
and
not
offered,
that
appears
on
page
50
of
the
record.
i
think
under
accepted
--
to
get
ahead
to
my
argument
under
accepted
canons,
the
fact
the
state
failed
to
offer
this
report
must
be
taken
to
harm
rather
than
help
the
state's
case
for
mrs.
beamer's
reliability.
seven
months
after
the
crime
on
the
night
of
august
16,
1965,
a
nashville
woman
was
assaulted.
the
police
arrested
petitioner,
archie
biggers,
a
16-year
old
negro
with
no
previous
record
of
trouble
with
the
police
as
he
was
receiving
medical
attention
at
a
local
hospital
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
newspaper
stories,
which
are
the
only
source
of
information
in
the
record,
state
that
he
claimed
he
had
been
cut
and
he
was
with
his
mother
at
the
hospital.
the
police
arrested
him
and
took
him
to
a
juvenile
detention
facility.
his
mother
was
with
him
and
she
was
told
of
what
the
record
only
characterizes
as
his
rights,
and
the
police
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
they
were
going
to
question
him
about
a
series
of
rapes.
the
following
day
two
police
officers
went
to
mrs.
beamer's
home,
told
her
that
they
had
a
suspect
they
wanted
her
to
look
at
and
brought
her
to
police
headquarters.
she
was
seated
in
a
room
with
five
police
officers,
but
no
lineup
was
held.
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
after
looking
at
him,
she
asked
the
police
to
have
him
speak,
and
after
he
spoke
these
words
of
the
assailant
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you”,
she
identified
him.
his
mother,
father
and
retained
attorney
were
not
present.
mr.
michael
meltsner
because
he
was
told
to
say
them
by
the
police.
biggers
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
seven
months
before.
biggers
was
indicted
with
rape
--
indicted
for
rape,
a
capital
offense
in
tennessee,
but
at
trial
the
only
evidence
tying
him
to
the
crime
was
mrs.
beamer's
testimony
on
direct
examination
that
she
had
identified
him
in
august
at
the
police
station
and
that
he
spoke
the
words
of
the
rapist.
at
first
she
denied
ever
having
seen
him,
that
appears
on
page
9
of
the
record.
she
then
changed
her
--
the
course
of
her
testimony
and
described
the
pretrial
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
was
asked
on
page
9
of
the
record
by
the
prosecuting
attorney,
“now
getting
to
the
central
facts
of
this
case,
have
you
ever
seen
the
defendant
before?”
she
said
no.
she
then
changed
the
course
of
her
testimony
and
the
described
the
pretrial
identification.
four
policemen
also
testified
on
direct
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
it
reflects
on
her
certainty.
this
is
a
due
process
case
and
in
a
sense
everything
counts
and
the
fact
that
she
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
it
counts
that
the
first
answer
was
no.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
it
was
asked
twice,
in
two
different
ways
and
both
times
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
right,
two
or
three
lines
below
it,
“was
the
defendant
at
any
time
at
your
home?”
“if
he
was,
i
didn't
see
him”.
it's
an
extremely
peculiar
first
response,
and
i
grant
your
honor
it's
totally
inconsistent
to
remainder
of
her
testimony.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
maybe
that's
what
she
meant,
but
i
don't
think
the
question
is
directed
to
that
in
turns
at
least.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
don't
think
it's
a
big
point,
but
i
do
think
it
reflects
on
her
certainty.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
she
perhaps
was
uncertain
or
confused
at
the
trial,
but
if
she
was
a
person
who
could
have
been
upset
and
confused
easily,
that
reflects
on
her
reliability
—
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
as
identification
witness.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i'll
leave
it
and
get
on
to
the
trial
where
her
testimony
was
totally
uncorroborated.
the
state
did
offer
the
testimony
of
four
police
officers
on
direct
examination
that
mrs.
beamer
had
identified
biggers
at
the
police
station,
although
the
fact
of
this
identification
had
not
been
challenged
and
the
12-year-old
daughter
was
unable
to
identify
him.
the
state
claims
in
its
brief
that
mrs.
beamer
identified
biggers
in
the
courtroom.
we
dispute
this
because
there's
a
standard
method
for
identifying
a
defendant
in
the
courtroom,
picking
him
out
and
it
wasn't
used
in
this
case.
a
final
occurrence
at
trial
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
he
was
objecting
to
the
repetitious
nature
of
that.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
her
–
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh,
“is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind?”
excuse
me
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
think
they
are
again
referring
to
the
pre-trial
identification.
identification
in
the
courtroom
is
a
question
of
locating
a
body
among
other
bodies,
not
the
question
of
saying
the
defendant's
name.
one
can
talk
about
a
person
without
knowing
exactly
who
he
is.
i
think
there's
an
important
reason
why
this
shouldn't
be
inferred
from
the
record,
not
that
it's
again
particularly
to
this
case,
because
the
burden
for
a
testimony
was
of
the
pre-trial
identification.
it's
important
that
a
witness
has
to
commit
him
or
herself
because
in
that
way
they're
responsible
and
any
doubts
they
have
are
expressed
in
that
way.
mr.
michael
meltsner
as
i
read
that
it's
a
comparison
between
the
way
he
looked
in
the
courtroom
and
the
way
he
looked
at
the
pre-trial
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
question
is
whose
hair?
there
is
standard
method
for
identifying
someone
in
the
courtroom,
it
just
wasn't
used
here,
but
again
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
important.
mr.
michael
meltsner
as
i
read
it,
it's
a
comparison
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
time
of
the
pre-trial
identification.
nothing
in
her
testimony
goes
back
the
seven
months
or
nine
or
ten
months
at
this
point
to
the
crime,
when
she's
identifying.
a
final
occurrence
at
the
trial
should
be
mentioned.
at
the
time
of
biggers'
arrest
and
identification
highly
prejudicial
newspaper
accounts
appeared
based
on
police
statements
to
the
press.
members
of
the
trial
jury
had
seen
these
stories
and
a
photograph.
the
state
at
the
beginning
of
trial
asked
mrs.
beamer
if
she
has
identified
biggers
before
or
after
these
newspaper
stories
appeared,
thus
making
the
stories
an
issue
at
the
trial.
it's
our
position
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
stovall,
where
a
show
up
or
exhibiting
a
defendant
alone
was
permitted
only
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
have
any
identification
proceeding.
but
in
this
case
a
line
up
was
imminently
practical.
petitioner
was
in
custody
and
continuously
available.
mrs.
beamer
was
available.
there
was
no
shortage
of
persons
to
hold
the
line
up,
biggers
was
taken
from
a
juvenile
detention
facility
to
a
police
headquarters
in
a
large
city,
in
the
daytime,
a
city
in
which
there
are
approximately
75,000
negroes
and
if
some
short
delay
was
required
not
shown
by
the
record,
it
would
not
have
been
prejudicial
because
the
crime
had
taken
place
seven
months
earlier.
the
dangers
of
the
show
up
procedure
are
well
known.
they
were
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinions
last
term,
presenting
a
man
alone
says
there
is
reason
to
believe
he
is
guilty.
this
is
the
very
question
which
the
identification
is
supposed
to
resolve.
it
also
magnifies
any
similarities
between
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
because
there
is
no
opportunity
for
comparison
and
it
affords
no
test
of
recollection.
now
these
dangers
worked
a
particularly
harsh
result
here,
because
of
a
number
of
circumstances.
mrs.
beamer's
initial
opportunity
to
observe
had
been
slight.
the
crime
took
place
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
she
never
saw
the
rapist
in
direct
light.
indeed
the
state
concedes
in
one
of
its
briefs
that
it
was
a
limited
opportunity,
and
she
was
understandably
frightened
and
in
fear
of
her
life.
again
the
state
concedes
she
was
emotionally
upset.
secondly,
the
gap
between
the
crime
and
identification
was
great
and
her
memory
must
have
faded.
and
thirdly,
she
relied
on
her
memory
of
her
voice.
she
didn't
identify
him
until
after
he
spoke.
memory
of
a
voice
is
a
particularly
abstract
and
unreliable
factor
on
which
to
base
an
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
no.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
the
lesser
opportunity
to
observe,
the
longer
the
gap
between
identification
and
the
crime,
the
more
suggestible
she
was
by
means
of
a
procedure
which
magnified
the
similarities
between
the
petitioner
and
the
criminal
and
told
her
that
the
police
had
evidence
against
him.
now
into
this
situation,
the
police
not
only
failed
to
use
available
procedures
to
protect
her
liability
but
they
affirmatively
corrupted
the
process
of
recollection
by
calling
biggers
as
suspect
and
making
him
say,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
the
more
dramatically
a
person
is
tied
to
the
crime,
the
more
likely
an
identification
will
be
the
product
of
suggestion
that
the
defendant
is
the
criminal
rather
than
any
free
recollection
of
the
crime.
and
nothing
which
took
place
at
trial
increased
the
reliability
of
this
identification,
it
was
corroborated.
mr.
michael
meltsner
totally
different
situation,
it
then
would
have
created
a
spur
to
recollection,
but
here
it
was
just
one
person
doing
it
and
so
the
actor
in
the
role,
as
so
often
happens
in
life,
were
confused.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
we
do
have
a
fifth
amendment
claim
about
this
your
honor,
which
the
stated
at
length
in
the
brief.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
my
point
is
that
assuming
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
contention
left
after
the
wade
case
as
to
speech
or
the
line-up,
then
the
suggestibility
of
the
use
of
these
inflammatory
words
would
not
have
been
directed
at
this
young
man
if
a
line
up
had
been
held.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
created
a
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
we
see
it
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
don't
think
we
–
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
don't
think
we
have
to
because
this
case
involves
testimony
about
that
speech.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no
absolutely
not,
absolutely
not.
we
think
the
court
should
reconsider
it
and
base
its
decision
on
the
volitional
cooperation
involved
in
compelled
speech,
but
we
don't
think
that
need
be
reached.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
first
thing
she
mentioned
when
she,
when
she
is
asked
why
she
identified
him,
it's
her
--
it
is
his
voice.
so
i
would
assume
that
it
was
a
heavy
fact
there,
also
she
did
not
identify
him
when
she
saw
him
immediately
she
waited
until
he
spoke.
mr.
michael
meltsner
another
occurrence
at
trial,
which
should
be
mentioned
is
the
states
pointing
of
five
fingers
at
the
petitioner
rather
than
one.
they
just
didn't
rest
on
mrs.
beamer's
identification
which
we
assert
is
tainted,
but
they
had
four
police
officers
testify
as
to
it,
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
injected
this
newspaper
story
into
the
record,
a
factor
which
must
have
robbed
the
jury's
capacity
to
objectively
appraise
this
identification
and
all
the
suggestion
here
was
unnecessary.
a
line
up
could
have
been
held,
the
officer
who
called
biggers
a
suspect
had
been
on
the
force
seventeen-and-a-half
years,
he
should
have
known
better.
he
didn't
have
to
speak,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
he
could
have
been
made
to
speak
innocent
words,
words
that
didn't
tie
into
the
crime
in
the
same
way,
his
parents
and
counsel
could
have
been
present
and
the
bolstering
of
this
tainted
identification
and
injection
of
the
newspaper
to
the
case
were
totally
unnecessary
trial
tactics.
mr.
michael
meltsner
just
a
few
points
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
must
object
to
the
characterization
of
him
as
a
peculiar
boy
by
these
defense
witnesses.
on
a
contrary
they
testified
to
his
good
character,
reliability
and
reputation.
i
believe
what
they
said
was
that
he
was
very
concerned
about
his
mother.
he
and
his
mother
seem
to
look
after
each
other
and
this
was
a
broken
home.
the
stepfather
had
left
and
he
is
living
somewhere
else.
i
don't
believe
that
the
testimony
was
that
she
had
people
looking
after
him
unusually.
these
were
just
neighbors
who
lived
in
the
vicinity.
now
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question
earlier
four
police
officers
did
testify
to
the
identification.
four
of
the
five
that
were
present
and
the
fifth
i
believe
was
sick
and
that's
the
only
reason
he
didn't
testify.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
one
way
i
think
it
could
be
looked
at.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
i
think
you
can
also
see
it
through
cases
like
--
well
first
of
all
stovall
is
the
primary
authority,
but
also
cases
like
turner
versus
louisiana
and
also
cases
like
napue.
there
is
not
a
very
great
difference
between
leading
one
to
testify
falsely
and
leading
one
to
testify
on
the
basis
of
a
mistaken
identification
and
this
is
--
and
the
identification
was
the
trial
in
this
case.
the
trial
was
in
appeal
for
the
identification
and
when
the
police
officers
came
in
and
kept
harping
on
it,
the
authority
of
the
police
officers
must
have
made
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
the
jurors
to
accurately
appraise
the
identification.
now
i
just
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
were
you
present
in
the
police
station?
did
mrs.
beamer
identified
this
young
man,
yes
she
did,
et
cetera.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct
and
objection
was
made
that
this
was
not
evidentiary.
it
was
just
harping
and
those
objections
were
overruled.
to
the
extent
the
state
seems
to
use
the
gap
between
the
crime
and
the
identification
to
explain
a
way
that
show
up
procedure.
i
think
it
clearly
must
be
the
state's
burden
to
show
factors,
circumstances
which
occurred
during
that
period
to
enhance
reliability.
this
record
is
just
not
enlightening
on
that
point.
the
state
never,
never
carried
that
burden.
clearly
the
petitioner
can't
carry
that
burden
because
he
doesn't
know
what
the
police
has
done
during
that
period.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state's
primary
defense,
as
raised
here,
it
maybe
good
in
certain
other
cases,
but
it's
not
good
on
this
record
because
the
record
just
doesn't
establish
the
circumstances
of
these
earlier
identifications.
there
may
have
been
lineups
held.
the
photographs
may
have
been
showing
in
july,
they
may
have
been
shown
in
february.
one
doesn't
know
and
it's
the
state's
burden
to
explain
it
in
a
way.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
this
is
all
outside
the
record.
my
understanding
is
he
was
not
arrested
for
rape,
he
was
arrested
on
a
loitering
charge
and
he
was
held
on
his
loitering
charge
while
the
police
showed
him
to
various
people
including
the
woman
who
was
assaulted,
not
raped,
assaulted
on
the
16th
of
august.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes
and
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
how
the
other
case
was
injected
by
the
state
before
the
jury.
the
newspaper
stories
which
i
have
referred
to
described
the
arrest,
they
say
he
confessed
to
certain
things,
they
say
that
he
was
identified
by
certain
women.
the
state
began
its
presentation
to
the
jury
by
asking
mrs.
beamer
if
she
had
identified
him
before
or
after
these
newspaper
stories
had
appeared
and
many
of
the
jurors
had
read
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
it
took
three
of
four
days
to
select
the
jury
in
this
case
for
that
reason.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
members
of
the
sitting
panel.
according
to
a
statement
of
counsel
in
the
trial
court,
jurors
who
had
been
accepted
for
the
trial
had
known
about
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
the
inference
from
that
statement,
yes.
they
were
accepted
despite
the
fact
they
had
seen
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it's
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor
it
is
a
point
made
by
counsel
when
he
is
objecting
to
this
other
case
being
mentioned.
mr.
michael
meltsner
concerning?
mr.
michael
meltsner
not
exclusively.
we
raised
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
believe
in
the
petition
we
mentioned
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
no,
not
the
newspaper
itself,
it's
just
another
factor
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
best
understanding
is
this,
he
has
never
been
indicted
for
the
assault
that
took
place
on
august
16,
but
he
has
been
indicted
for
two
other
charges
in
davidson
county
and
these
charges
have
not
come
to
trial,
but
the
original
one
he
has
not
been
indicted.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
to
review
a
16-year
old
boy’s
conviction
and
sentenced
to
20
years
in
prison
for
the
crime
of
rape.
because
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
total
circumstances
surrounding
petitioner's
identification
and
its
use
at
trial
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
intend
to
state
the
facts
in
some
detail.
on
the
night
of
january
22,
1965
mrs.
margaret
beamer,
a
negro
nurse
was
sewing
in
the
living
room
of
her
nashville,
tennessee
home.
her
12-year
old
daughter
was
in
a
bedroom,
listening
to
phonograph
records
and
a
six-year
old
son
was
asleep
in
another
bedroom.
the
living
room
was
a
lit
by
a
single
lamp
and
the
lights
were
off
in
an
adjoining
hallway
and
kitchen.
at
about
9:10
pm
mrs.
beamer
rose
and
entered
this
hallway.
she
was
grabbed
from
behind
and
pushed
to
the
floor
by
an
intruder
holding
a
long
butcher
knife.
she
began
to
scream
and
sob,
and
her
12-year
old
daughter
came
to
the
door
of
the
adjacent
bedroom
and
also
began
to
scream
when
she
saw
her
mother
and
the
assailant.
intruder
then
said,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you
both,
to
the
women,”
and
he
had
mrs.
beamer
order
her
daughter
back
into
the
bedroom.
he
then
forced
her
to
walk
through
an
unlit
kitchen,
out
behind
the
house
up
in
an
embankment
to
some
railroads
tracks
and
took
her
to
a
place
in
the
woods
where
he
raped
her.
the
only
light
behind
the
house
came
from
the
moon,
streetlights
which
were
located
in
front
of
the
house;
there
were
no
lights
on
the
tracks.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
place
it
does
is
in
newspaper
story
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
prosecution,
and
i
believe
she
is
39
from
that
story.
these
events
lasted
from
10
to
30
minutes
at
the
most
and
mrs.
beamer
testified
that
throughout
she
was
frightened
in
fear
and
crying.
after
the
rape,
the
rapist
ran
away
and
mrs.
beamer
reported
the
crime
to
the
police.
after
she
did
this
at
dates
and
times
and
under
circumstances
which
the
record
does
not
particularly
reveal,
she
was
shown
30
or
40
photographs
from
police
files
and
saw
a
several
suspects
at
headquarters.
however,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
she
never
was
shown
the
petitioner
in
this
case
at
these
viewings.
mr.
michael
meltsner
date
of
the
incident
was
january
22,
1965.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
record
does
not
say.
she
was
shown
these
photographs,
but
at
no
time
did
the
state
introduce
evidence,
showing
the
dates,
how
long
over
the
period
of
time
between
the
crime
and
the
eventual
identification
proceeding.
mr.
michael
meltsner
quite
clearly,
she
was
asked
at
one
point,
did
you
know
who
raped
you
before
the
pretrial
identification.
she
said
no.
a
police
officer
testified
that
he
had
never
shown
photographs
of
the
petitioner
to
her,
the
petitioner
took
the
stand,
was
not
cross-examined
about
a
criminal
record.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
that
took
place,
that
took
place
seven
months
later.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
august
of
1965.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
was
shown
some
30
or
40
photographs.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
the
photographs
she
was
shown
did
not
include
the
petitioner.
she
was
shown
30
or
40
photographs
from
police
files,
she
was
never
shown
a
picture
of
the
petitioner.
the
record
does
not
show
whether
she
saw
these
photographs
a
day
after
the
crime
or
a
week
after
the
crime,
although
i
must
confess
my
reading
of
the
record,
it
certainly
seems
to
be
that
way.
that's
the
impression,
but
certainly
the
record
does,
is
really
--
is
not
clear
on
this
point.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
did
see
one
person
who
she
said
had
features
like
the
rapist,
but
other
than
that
she
identified,
i
mean
she
saw
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
a
direct
viewing
or
through
a
photograph
as
i
recall.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
said
that
one
person
had
features
like
the
rapist.
now,
when
she
gave
a
description
to
the
police
at
the
time
the
crime
was
reported,
a
police
officer
wrote
down
what
she
said
and
he
described
it
as,
“she
told
me
as
best
she
could,”
and
he
wrote
it
down
and
this
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
state
never
offered
this
contemporaneous
description
or
the
record
of
it
into
evidence
at
the
trial
nor
did
mrs.
beamer
ever
testify
as
to
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
she
talked
totally
in
terms
of
the
pretrial
identification,
almost
totally.
she
never
referred
back
to
the
crime.
mr.
michael
meltsner
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
she
didn't
identify
him
until
he
spoke.
he
was
called
into
a
room.
she
was
sitting
there
with
five
police
officers
but
there
was
no
lone
up
and
she
then
requested
the
police
to
have
him
speak
and
she
said,
have
him
say,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you,”
and
the
police
officer
said
say
it,
say
it
boy,
and
he
hesitated.
and
he
said,
say
it
and
then
the
petitioner
said,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
16.
mr.
michael
meltsner
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
to
answer
the
question
you
asked,
before
the
recess
mr.
chief
justice,
at
trial
a
police
officer
revealed
that
a
written
report
of
mrs.
beamer's
description
had
been
taken
down
at
the
time
she
reported
the
crime,
but
the
state
never
offered
this
description
into
evidence
nor
did
mrs.
beamer
testify
about
the
character
of
her
initial
description.
now,
seven
months
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
thing
on
the
record
is
that
a
description
was
taken
down
and
not
offered,
that
appears
on
page
50
of
the
record.
i
think
under
accepted
--
to
get
ahead
to
my
argument
under
accepted
canons,
the
fact
the
state
failed
to
offer
this
report
must
be
taken
to
harm
rather
than
help
the
state's
case
for
mrs.
beamer's
reliability.
seven
months
after
the
crime
on
the
night
of
august
16,
1965,
a
nashville
woman
was
assaulted.
the
police
arrested
petitioner,
archie
biggers,
a
16-year
old
negro
with
no
previous
record
of
trouble
with
the
police
as
he
was
receiving
medical
attention
at
a
local
hospital
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
newspaper
stories,
which
are
the
only
source
of
information
in
the
record,
state
that
he
claimed
he
had
been
cut
and
he
was
with
his
mother
at
the
hospital.
the
police
arrested
him
and
took
him
to
a
juvenile
detention
facility.
his
mother
was
with
him
and
she
was
told
of
what
the
record
only
characterizes
as
his
rights,
and
the
police
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
they
were
going
to
question
him
about
a
series
of
rapes.
the
following
day
two
police
officers
went
to
mrs.
beamer's
home,
told
her
that
they
had
a
suspect
they
wanted
her
to
look
at
and
brought
her
to
police
headquarters.
she
was
seated
in
a
room
with
five
police
officers,
but
no
lineup
was
held.
the
petitioner
was
brought
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
after
looking
at
him,
she
asked
the
police
to
have
him
speak,
and
after
he
spoke
these
words
of
the
assailant
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you”,
she
identified
him.
his
mother,
father
and
retained
attorney
were
not
present.
mr.
michael
meltsner
because
he
was
told
to
say
them
by
the
police.
biggers
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
seven
months
before.
biggers
was
indicted
with
rape
--
indicted
for
rape,
a
capital
offense
in
tennessee,
but
at
trial
the
only
evidence
tying
him
to
the
crime
was
mrs.
beamer's
testimony
on
direct
examination
that
she
had
identified
him
in
august
at
the
police
station
and
that
he
spoke
the
words
of
the
rapist.
at
first
she
denied
ever
having
seen
him,
that
appears
on
page
9
of
the
record.
she
then
changed
her
--
the
course
of
her
testimony
and
described
the
pretrial
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
she
was
asked
on
page
9
of
the
record
by
the
prosecuting
attorney,
“now
getting
to
the
central
facts
of
this
case,
have
you
ever
seen
the
defendant
before?”
she
said
no.
she
then
changed
the
course
of
her
testimony
and
the
described
the
pretrial
identification.
four
policemen
also
testified
on
direct
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
it
reflects
on
her
certainty.
this
is
a
due
process
case
and
in
a
sense
everything
counts
and
the
fact
that
she
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
it
counts
that
the
first
answer
was
no.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
it
was
asked
twice,
in
two
different
ways
and
both
times
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
right,
two
or
three
lines
below
it,
“was
the
defendant
at
any
time
at
your
home?”
“if
he
was,
i
didn't
see
him”.
it's
an
extremely
peculiar
first
response,
and
i
grant
your
honor
it's
totally
inconsistent
to
remainder
of
her
testimony.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
maybe
that's
what
she
meant,
but
i
don't
think
the
question
is
directed
to
that
in
turns
at
least.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
don't
think
it's
a
big
point,
but
i
do
think
it
reflects
on
her
certainty.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
she
perhaps
was
uncertain
or
confused
at
the
trial,
but
if
she
was
a
person
who
could
have
been
upset
and
confused
easily,
that
reflects
on
her
reliability
—
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
as
identification
witness.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i'll
leave
it
and
get
on
to
the
trial
where
her
testimony
was
totally
uncorroborated.
the
state
did
offer
the
testimony
of
four
police
officers
on
direct
examination
that
mrs.
beamer
had
identified
biggers
at
the
police
station,
although
the
fact
of
this
identification
had
not
been
challenged
and
the
12-year-old
daughter
was
unable
to
identify
him.
the
state
claims
in
its
brief
that
mrs.
beamer
identified
biggers
in
the
courtroom.
we
dispute
this
because
there's
a
standard
method
for
identifying
a
defendant
in
the
courtroom,
picking
him
out
and
it
wasn't
used
in
this
case.
a
final
occurrence
at
trial
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
he
was
objecting
to
the
repetitious
nature
of
that.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
her
–
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh,
“is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind?”
excuse
me
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
think
they
are
again
referring
to
the
pre-trial
identification.
identification
in
the
courtroom
is
a
question
of
locating
a
body
among
other
bodies,
not
the
question
of
saying
the
defendant's
name.
one
can
talk
about
a
person
without
knowing
exactly
who
he
is.
i
think
there's
an
important
reason
why
this
shouldn't
be
inferred
from
the
record,
not
that
it's
again
particularly
to
this
case,
because
the
burden
for
a
testimony
was
of
the
pre-trial
identification.
it's
important
that
a
witness
has
to
commit
him
or
herself
because
in
that
way
they're
responsible
and
any
doubts
they
have
are
expressed
in
that
way.
mr.
michael
meltsner
as
i
read
that
it's
a
comparison
between
the
way
he
looked
in
the
courtroom
and
the
way
he
looked
at
the
pre-trial
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
question
is
whose
hair?
there
is
standard
method
for
identifying
someone
in
the
courtroom,
it
just
wasn't
used
here,
but
again
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
important.
mr.
michael
meltsner
as
i
read
it,
it's
a
comparison
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
time
of
the
pre-trial
identification.
nothing
in
her
testimony
goes
back
the
seven
months
or
nine
or
ten
months
at
this
point
to
the
crime,
when
she's
identifying.
a
final
occurrence
at
the
trial
should
be
mentioned.
at
the
time
of
biggers'
arrest
and
identification
highly
prejudicial
newspaper
accounts
appeared
based
on
police
statements
to
the
press.
members
of
the
trial
jury
had
seen
these
stories
and
a
photograph.
the
state
at
the
beginning
of
trial
asked
mrs.
beamer
if
she
has
identified
biggers
before
or
after
these
newspaper
stories
appeared,
thus
making
the
stories
an
issue
at
the
trial.
it's
our
position
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
stovall,
where
a
show
up
or
exhibiting
a
defendant
alone
was
permitted
only
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
have
any
identification
proceeding.
but
in
this
case
a
line
up
was
imminently
practical.
petitioner
was
in
custody
and
continuously
available.
mrs.
beamer
was
available.
there
was
no
shortage
of
persons
to
hold
the
line
up,
biggers
was
taken
from
a
juvenile
detention
facility
to
a
police
headquarters
in
a
large
city,
in
the
daytime,
a
city
in
which
there
are
approximately
75,000
negroes
and
if
some
short
delay
was
required
not
shown
by
the
record,
it
would
not
have
been
prejudicial
because
the
crime
had
taken
place
seven
months
earlier.
the
dangers
of
the
show
up
procedure
are
well
known.
they
were
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinions
last
term,
presenting
a
man
alone
says
there
is
reason
to
believe
he
is
guilty.
this
is
the
very
question
which
the
identification
is
supposed
to
resolve.
it
also
magnifies
any
similarities
between
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
because
there
is
no
opportunity
for
comparison
and
it
affords
no
test
of
recollection.
now
these
dangers
worked
a
particularly
harsh
result
here,
because
of
a
number
of
circumstances.
mrs.
beamer's
initial
opportunity
to
observe
had
been
slight.
the
crime
took
place
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
she
never
saw
the
rapist
in
direct
light.
indeed
the
state
concedes
in
one
of
its
briefs
that
it
was
a
limited
opportunity,
and
she
was
understandably
frightened
and
in
fear
of
her
life.
again
the
state
concedes
she
was
emotionally
upset.
secondly,
the
gap
between
the
crime
and
identification
was
great
and
her
memory
must
have
faded.
and
thirdly,
she
relied
on
her
memory
of
her
voice.
she
didn't
identify
him
until
after
he
spoke.
memory
of
a
voice
is
a
particularly
abstract
and
unreliable
factor
on
which
to
base
an
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
no.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
the
lesser
opportunity
to
observe,
the
longer
the
gap
between
identification
and
the
crime,
the
more
suggestible
she
was
by
means
of
a
procedure
which
magnified
the
similarities
between
the
petitioner
and
the
criminal
and
told
her
that
the
police
had
evidence
against
him.
now
into
this
situation,
the
police
not
only
failed
to
use
available
procedures
to
protect
her
liability
but
they
affirmatively
corrupted
the
process
of
recollection
by
calling
biggers
as
suspect
and
making
him
say,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
the
more
dramatically
a
person
is
tied
to
the
crime,
the
more
likely
an
identification
will
be
the
product
of
suggestion
that
the
defendant
is
the
criminal
rather
than
any
free
recollection
of
the
crime.
and
nothing
which
took
place
at
trial
increased
the
reliability
of
this
identification,
it
was
corroborated.
mr.
michael
meltsner
totally
different
situation,
it
then
would
have
created
a
spur
to
recollection,
but
here
it
was
just
one
person
doing
it
and
so
the
actor
in
the
role,
as
so
often
happens
in
life,
were
confused.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
we
do
have
a
fifth
amendment
claim
about
this
your
honor,
which
the
stated
at
length
in
the
brief.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
my
point
is
that
assuming
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
contention
left
after
the
wade
case
as
to
speech
or
the
line-up,
then
the
suggestibility
of
the
use
of
these
inflammatory
words
would
not
have
been
directed
at
this
young
man
if
a
line
up
had
been
held.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
created
a
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
we
see
it
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
don't
think
we
–
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
don't
think
we
have
to
because
this
case
involves
testimony
about
that
speech.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no
absolutely
not,
absolutely
not.
we
think
the
court
should
reconsider
it
and
base
its
decision
on
the
volitional
cooperation
involved
in
compelled
speech,
but
we
don't
think
that
need
be
reached.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
first
thing
she
mentioned
when
she,
when
she
is
asked
why
she
identified
him,
it's
her
--
it
is
his
voice.
so
i
would
assume
that
it
was
a
heavy
fact
there,
also
she
did
not
identify
him
when
she
saw
him
immediately
she
waited
until
he
spoke.
mr.
michael
meltsner
another
occurrence
at
trial,
which
should
be
mentioned
is
the
states
pointing
of
five
fingers
at
the
petitioner
rather
than
one.
they
just
didn't
rest
on
mrs.
beamer's
identification
which
we
assert
is
tainted,
but
they
had
four
police
officers
testify
as
to
it,
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
they
injected
this
newspaper
story
into
the
record,
a
factor
which
must
have
robbed
the
jury's
capacity
to
objectively
appraise
this
identification
and
all
the
suggestion
here
was
unnecessary.
a
line
up
could
have
been
held,
the
officer
who
called
biggers
a
suspect
had
been
on
the
force
seventeen-and-a-half
years,
he
should
have
known
better.
he
didn't
have
to
speak,
“shut
up
or
i'll
kill
you.”
he
could
have
been
made
to
speak
innocent
words,
words
that
didn't
tie
into
the
crime
in
the
same
way,
his
parents
and
counsel
could
have
been
present
and
the
bolstering
of
this
tainted
identification
and
injection
of
the
newspaper
to
the
case
were
totally
unnecessary
trial
tactics.
mr.
michael
meltsner
just
a
few
points
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
must
object
to
the
characterization
of
him
as
a
peculiar
boy
by
these
defense
witnesses.
on
a
contrary
they
testified
to
his
good
character,
reliability
and
reputation.
i
believe
what
they
said
was
that
he
was
very
concerned
about
his
mother.
he
and
his
mother
seem
to
look
after
each
other
and
this
was
a
broken
home.
the
stepfather
had
left
and
he
is
living
somewhere
else.
i
don't
believe
that
the
testimony
was
that
she
had
people
looking
after
him
unusually.
these
were
just
neighbors
who
lived
in
the
vicinity.
now
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question
earlier
four
police
officers
did
testify
to
the
identification.
four
of
the
five
that
were
present
and
the
fifth
i
believe
was
sick
and
that's
the
only
reason
he
didn't
testify.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
one
way
i
think
it
could
be
looked
at.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
i
think
you
can
also
see
it
through
cases
like
--
well
first
of
all
stovall
is
the
primary
authority,
but
also
cases
like
turner
versus
louisiana
and
also
cases
like
napue.
there
is
not
a
very
great
difference
between
leading
one
to
testify
falsely
and
leading
one
to
testify
on
the
basis
of
a
mistaken
identification
and
this
is
--
and
the
identification
was
the
trial
in
this
case.
the
trial
was
in
appeal
for
the
identification
and
when
the
police
officers
came
in
and
kept
harping
on
it,
the
authority
of
the
police
officers
must
have
made
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
the
jurors
to
accurately
appraise
the
identification.
now
i
just
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
were
you
present
in
the
police
station?
did
mrs.
beamer
identified
this
young
man,
yes
she
did,
et
cetera.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct
and
objection
was
made
that
this
was
not
evidentiary.
it
was
just
harping
and
those
objections
were
overruled.
to
the
extent
the
state
seems
to
use
the
gap
between
the
crime
and
the
identification
to
explain
a
way
that
show
up
procedure.
i
think
it
clearly
must
be
the
state's
burden
to
show
factors,
circumstances
which
occurred
during
that
period
to
enhance
reliability.
this
record
is
just
not
enlightening
on
that
point.
the
state
never,
never
carried
that
burden.
clearly
the
petitioner
can't
carry
that
burden
because
he
doesn't
know
what
the
police
has
done
during
that
period.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state's
primary
defense,
as
raised
here,
it
maybe
good
in
certain
other
cases,
but
it's
not
good
on
this
record
because
the
record
just
doesn't
establish
the
circumstances
of
these
earlier
identifications.
there
may
have
been
lineups
held.
the
photographs
may
have
been
showing
in
july,
they
may
have
been
shown
in
february.
one
doesn't
know
and
it's
the
state's
burden
to
explain
it
in
a
way.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
this
is
all
outside
the
record.
my
understanding
is
he
was
not
arrested
for
rape,
he
was
arrested
on
a
loitering
charge
and
he
was
held
on
his
loitering
charge
while
the
police
showed
him
to
various
people
including
the
woman
who
was
assaulted,
not
raped,
assaulted
on
the
16th
of
august.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes
and
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
how
the
other
case
was
injected
by
the
state
before
the
jury.
the
newspaper
stories
which
i
have
referred
to
described
the
arrest,
they
say
he
confessed
to
certain
things,
they
say
that
he
was
identified
by
certain
women.
the
state
began
its
presentation
to
the
jury
by
asking
mrs.
beamer
if
she
had
identified
him
before
or
after
these
newspaper
stories
had
appeared
and
many
of
the
jurors
had
read
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
correct.
it
took
three
of
four
days
to
select
the
jury
in
this
case
for
that
reason.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
members
of
the
sitting
panel.
according
to
a
statement
of
counsel
in
the
trial
court,
jurors
who
had
been
accepted
for
the
trial
had
known
about
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that's
the
inference
from
that
statement,
yes.
they
were
accepted
despite
the
fact
they
had
seen
these
stories.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it's
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor
it
is
a
point
made
by
counsel
when
he
is
objecting
to
this
other
case
being
mentioned.
mr.
michael
meltsner
concerning?
mr.
michael
meltsner
not
exclusively.
we
raised
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
believe
in
the
petition
we
mentioned
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
no,
not
the
newspaper
itself,
it's
just
another
factor
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
best
understanding
is
this,
he
has
never
been
indicted
for
the
assault
that
took
place
on
august
16,
but
he
has
been
indicted
for
two
other
charges
in
davidson
county
and
these
charges
have
not
come
to
trial,
but
the
original
one
he
has
not
been
indicted.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
