justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
is
that
i
gather,
that
a
complaint
by
the
member
of
the
union
under
this
complaint
section
opens
up
the
matter
for
the
secretary
to
investigate
anything
legal
or
illegal
about
the
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
elections
are
immune
from
the
fact
that
the
secretary,
expect
upon
a
complaint
by
a
member
and
that
the
secretary
is
limited
to
the
precise
complaint,
which
the
member
proposed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
cannot
go
to
other
ground
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
was
raised
by
the
member?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
intended
in
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
believe
the
union
agreed
acceptance
to
provide
individual
members
to
attack
the
election
on
a
particular
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
601
gives
the
power,
what
difference
does
it
make,
how
it
proves
the
other
clause
relating
to
the
membership
you
have?
this
particular
one,
gives
the
secretary
a
full
and
free
trial
to
investigate
whenever
he
feels
--
to
disclose
a
fault
in
the
election.
what
difference
does
it
make,
how
we
construe,
how
narrow
or
how
broadly
we
construe
the
secretary's
power
under
the
membership?
