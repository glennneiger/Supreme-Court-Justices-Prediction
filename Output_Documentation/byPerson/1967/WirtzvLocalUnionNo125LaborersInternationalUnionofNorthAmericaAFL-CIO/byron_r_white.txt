this

you

it

[inaudible]
justice

your

complained
and
attacked
the
second
election?
justice
byron

based

justice

i
guess
then
you
do
say
that
we
have
to
reach
in
this
case
a
question
of
alluding
affect
of
an
untainted
election?
justice

well,
mr.
riemer,
if
the
mootness
in
this
case
happened
to
depend
on
whether
or
not
there
was
something
wrong
for
the
second
election
and
suppose
the
secretary
had
the
power
under
601
to
make
that
kind
of
an
investigation
determinant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
this
secretary
investigate
the
second
election
other
than
this
supervisory.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
a
decision
on
mootness
in
your
favor
washout
all
the
other
issues
in
this
case?
justice
byron

white
how
do
you
get
to
that
if
the

is
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
what
exhaustive
amounts
to
in
this

let's
assume
that
the

a

he
complains

he
didn't
have
the
full
watcher
like
the
statute
requires
or
permits
and
he
complains
and
the
union
says
yes
that's
very
true,
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly
i
agree.
so
he
does
and
the
union
granted
that,
then
what
happens
if
they
sustained
his
charges?
justice
byron

white
if
they
sustain
that
they
find
out
that
what
he

true?

there

power

to

you

watcher

[inaudible]
the
first
election
and
then
the
second
election
is
perfectly
clear
that
nothing
happened
at
all,
you
would

that
the

would
still
have
the
right
to
say
that
this
not
moved.
justice

you
need
a
what?
justice
byron

white
okay.
justice

there
anything
