mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
claiborne.
this
case
your
honors
involves
election
under
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
in
which
cecil
dial
(ph)
the
union’s
incumbent
business
representative
was
defeated
in
his
campaign
for
reelection
by
andrew
jackson,
his
rank
and
file
opponent.
dial
protested
of
his
defeat
only
to
the
international
union.
his
protest
was
denied.
he
complained
again
to
the
secretary
about
his
defeat
only
and
eventually
a
supervised
election
was
directed
by
the
district
court.
simultaneously
were
the
regular
1966
scheduled
union
election
and
dial
was
again
defeated.
the
secretary
now
seeks
to
set
aside
the
1963
election
of
officers,
which
was
never
protested
or
challenged
and
those
terms
have
long
expired
and
to
expunge
the
untainted
1966
election,
which
was
never
challenged.
we
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
warrant
what
has
been
referred
to
as
laboratory
election
or
the
remedial
intervention
of
the
secretary
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
they
are
triennial
elections
your
honor.
the
next
scheduled
election
would
be
in
1969.
if
you
were
to
agree
with
the
secretary,
another
election
under
the
secretary's
supervision
would
be
conducted.
the
individuals
now
in
office
would
be
presumably,
if
defeated,
removed
from
office
and
other
individuals
would
come
in.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
some
change
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
a
change
in
the
trustees.
there
was
a
change
in
the
president.
the
1966
election
elected
a
new
president.
of
course
the
business
representative
is
now
different.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
the
union
held
its
regular
triennial
election
in
june
of
1963.
all
nine
officers
except
that
of
business
representative
were
filled.
here
a
tie
resulted
between
dial,
the
incumbent
who
had
been
in
office
for
sometime
and
andrew
jackson,
his
rank
and
file
opponent.
this
election
was
not
challenged,
but
because
of
the
tie,
it
became
necessary
to
conduct
a
runoff
election
in
july
of
1963.
this
runoff
election
like
the
predecessor
election
in
june
was
supervised
by
a
secretly
elected
rank
and
file
committee
of
election
judges.
dial
lost
this
election,
the
runoff
election
to
jackson
by
some
19
votes.
he
filed
a
timely
protest
only
about
his
loss
of
the
job.
he
was
not
concerned
about
any
other
officer,
but
only
about
himself
and
he
intended
only
to
protest
his
own
defeat.
dial
was
accorded
a
full
hearing
by
the
international,
a
complete
hearing,
on
notice.
he
was
present.
the
union
representatives
were
present.
a
full
inquiry
was
made
and
it
was
made
clear
to
the
international
hearing
panel
that
dial
was
protesting
only
his
own
defeat.
he
was
not
concerned
about
anything
else.
because
dial
was
unable
to
substantiate
the
proof
that
enough
ineligible
members
voted
to
affect
the
election
result,
the
international
denied
his
protest.
he
then
made
a
timely
appeal
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
conducted
an
investigation.
this
investigation
or
the
results
of
the
investigation
were
made
known
to
the
international
union.
the
secretary
claimed
that
he
had
in
the
investigation
uncovered
irregularities
in
the
june
election
as
well
as
in
the
runoff
election
and
was
therefore
asking
the
international
union
to
set
aside
both
the
june
regular
election
and
the
july
runoff
election.
the
international
union
questioned
the
secretary's
jurisdiction
to
set
aside
an
election
which
had
never
been
protested
and
which
had
not
been
considered
by
the
international
union
in
its
hearing's
panel,
but
did
say
to
the
secretary
that
if
proof
of
irregularities
in
the
runoff
could
be
further
substantiated,
it
would
reopen
its
record
and
again
consider
the
runoff
election.
within
a
week
or
ten
days
after
that,
the
secretary
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
of
northern
district
of
ohio.
now
two
questions
it
seems
to
me
your
honors
are
presented
in
this
posture.
did
the
intervening
election
in
1966,
held
in
conjunction
or
connection
with
the
supervised
election
for
business
representative
moot
this
case
and
in
any
event,
we
submit
it
may
have
been
further
mooted
because
the
international
in
october
1966
after
the
appeal
had
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
amended
its
constitution
to
prevent
in
the
future
any
occurrence
of
this
nature.
but
if
the
court
should
hold
the
election
as
not
moot,
then
there
is
a
further
issue
before
perhaps
and
that
is
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
include
violations
not
complained
of
by
any
union
member
and
never
considered
by
the
union
and
whether
the
secretary
has
a
free-wheeling
investigation
upon
which
he
can
uncover
any
violation
never
complained
of
by
a
member
or
never
considered
by
the
union
and
file
a
complaint
based
upon
that.
now
these
issues
arise
because
filing
--
following
the
filing
of
the
secretaries
broadened
complaint,
a
motion
was
made
in
the
district
court
to
dismiss
all
allegations
of
the
complaint
pertaining
to
the
june
in
1963
election.
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion
claiming
that
the
member
had
never
exhausted
any
remedies
concerning
the
june
election.
no
protest
concerning
the
june
election
had
been
made
by
any
member
to
the
international.
the
international
had
never
considered
it
and
under
the
language
of
the
statute
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
to
entertain
a
complaint
based
upon
those
allegations.
now
almost
two
years
later
and
i
think
mr.
claiborne
yesterday
perhaps
inadvertently
created
the
inference
that
this
happened
right
after
the
district
court
had
come
down
with
its
motion
to
dismiss,
but
almost
two
years
later
in
april
1966,
the
district
court
judge
battisti
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
remaining
portions
of
the
complaint
dealing
only
with
the
runoff
election
concerning
which
there
had
been
a
protest,
concerning
which
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
concerning
which
the
secretary
had
under
the
statute
conducted
his
investigation.
summary
judgment
was
granted
with
respect
to
that.
the
district
court
judge
battisti,
in
his
decision
of
april
1966
recognizing
the
imminence
of
the
oncoming
june
1966
election
and
the
practical
problems
that
would
be
raised,
directed
that
the
supervised
election
for
business
representative
be
conducted
at
the
same
time
as
the
regular
election.
and
so
representatives
of
the
department
of
labor
and
union
representatives
met
and
laid
out
the
details
of
the
supervised
election.
now
this
was
no
casual
meeting
your
honors.
this
was
a
detailed,
deliberate,
considered
arrangement
of
all
of
the
details
that
go
into
a
union
election
even
down
to
and
including
the
color
of
the
ballot
that
would
be
used.
so
on
july
11,
1966
the
government
got
its
supervised
election,
department
of
labor
representatives
were
present,
the
other
officers
were
filled
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir,
there
was
a
separate
ballot
used.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
a
different
colored
ballot
was
used
for
the
supervised
election
for
business
representatives.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
don't
know
your
honor
the
answer
to
that,
but
there
were
separate
ballot
boxes,
a
separate
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
now
dial
again
lost
this
election,
but
the
day
before
the
election
on
july
10,
one
day
before
this
election,
the
secretary
appealed,
court
of
appeals
from
both
judge
connell's
order
of
july
1964
and
judge
battisti's
order
of
april
1966,
the
union
moved
to
dismiss,
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
union's
motion
agreed
with
it
that
the
supervening
event,
the
supervening
event
in
1966,
the
regular
election
occurring
simultaneously
with
a
supervised
election
rendered
the
secretary's
case
moot.
i
may
say
at
this
time
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
white
raised
yesterday,
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence,
not
a
scintilla
of
an
inference
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
regular
election
in
1966.
it's
clean,
absolutely
clean
and
i
think
mr.
claiborne
must
concede
that.
now
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
is
a
unified
scheme
to
protect
the
rights
and
interests
of
union
members
and
the
public.
i
think
there
has
been
a
lack
of
presentation,
if
i
may
say
so,
concerning
both
the
structure
and
the
content
of
the
statute
which
this
court
must
consider.
under
section
402,
on
complaint
of
a
union
member,
it
must
be
a
union
member,
the
secretary
after
investigation
may
bring
a
civil
action
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election,
not
a
later
election,
not
any
other
election,
but
the
election
found
to
be
invalid.
in
the
meantime
pending
this
conclusion,
the
election
even
though
challenged
is
presumed
to
be
valid.
it
allows
the
elected
officers
to
continue
to
function.
this
i
think
was
a
deliberate
choice
congress
made
rather
than
move,
remove
the
challenged
official.
somebody
had
to
run
this
union
or
the
union
and
they
were
permitted
to
remain
so
that
the
affairs
would
not
descend
into
chaos.
but
it's
the
election
or
the
election
contest
that
was
challenged,
that's
investigated
and
whereupon
trial
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
it
reveals
that
a
violation
may
have
occurred
then
a
court
is
then
authorized
to
declare
the
election
void
in
the
conduct
of
a
new
election.
thus
in
1966,
when
the
union
officers
who
had
been
elected
in
1963
completed
their
terms
of
office,
the
secretary's
action
was
moot,
these
terms
of
office
had
expired.
resulting
from
the
invalid,
unchallenged
election,
the
terms
of
office
had
expired
and
the
allegedly
invalid,
unchallenged
election
was
over.
the
officers
who
were
now
holding
office
in
1966
came
in
as
a
result
of
an
unchallenged,
un-protested
election.
no
purpose
would
be
served
now
by
an
order
in
1967
or
perhaps
in
1968
to
conduct
a
wholly
new
supervised
election.
the
secretary
has
had
his
supervision.
he
has
had
his
supervised
election,
and
the
only
effect
seems
to
me
of
a
supervised
election
at
this
time
would
be
to
remove
or
to
set-aside
the
election
of
those
elected
in
1963
whose
terms
of
office
have
expired
and
the
practical
effect
would
be
the
un-seeding
of
those
who
were
elected
in
1966.
there
has
been
no
mention
in
the
presentation
of
the
case
as
far
as
section
601,
and
if
the
contention
were
to
be
made
that
this
is
to
declare
this
action
moot
is
a
serious
hamper
upon
the
effective
administration
of
the
statute
by
the
secretary.
i
would
call
to
court's
attention
section
601
of
the
statute.
here
under
this
section,
the
secretary
has
given
a
broad
plenary
power
to
conduct
investigations
from
top
to
bottom.
there
need
be
no
challenge.
there
need
be
no
complaint
and
if
the
secretary's
representatives
who
were
present
in
the
union
hall
in
youngstown
on
july
11,
1966
had
any
cause
to
believe
there
was
anything
unregular
about
that
election
under
section
601
without
a
complaint,
they
could
have
disclosed
every
wrongdoing,
but
nothing
was
forthcoming.
and
because
of
this
latitude,
if
this
case
were
to
be
declared
moot,
no
undue
burden
is
placed
upon
the
secretary
in
the
effective
administration
of
the
statute.
moreover
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
gist
of
the
complaint
here
was
that
some
50
to
60
ineligible
members
voted,
and
some
15
or
16
ineligible
members
were
candidates
for
office.
this
is
because
of
a
strict
interpretation
placed
by
the
secretary
upon
the
constitution.
it's
because
of
that
strict
interpretation
placed
upon
it
and
that
the
union
in
october
1966,
the
international
union
in
october
1966
amended
its
constitution.
so
that
from
now
on
in
when
the
member
pays,
if
a
member
fails
to
pay
his
dues
on
the
first
day
of
the
month,
and
if
they
are
not
paid
by
the
last
day
of
the
next
following
month
then
that
member
shall
be
subject
to
be
suspended
by
the
international.
but
as
long
as
he
as
paid
his
dues
and
has
not
been
suspended
by
the
international
union,
he
has
the
franchise
and
he
can
go
in
and
cast
his
ballot
and
he
will
not
be
denied
the
privilege
of
voting.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
the
secretary's
remedy
under
section
601
mr.
justice
fortas
is
to
conduct
investigations
to
subpoena
records
to
go
into
every
conceivable
aspect
of
the
union's
conduct.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
oh!
the
remedy?
the
remedy,
your
honor,
would
be
public
disclosure.
it
would
be
a
report
to
the
member.
it
seems
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
no,
no
sir,
no
your
honor,
no.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
public
disclosure,
the
inherent
and
deterrent
power
of
public
disclosure
is
a
rather
powerful
weapon.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
not,
not,
no
your
honor,
not
the
equivalent
of
a
legal
proceeding
but
i
cannot
overlook
the
powerful
deterrent
effect
on
the
union
move
of
a
disclosure
concerning
any
irregularities.
i
am
sure
that
this
would
cause
the
members
to
respond
by
then
filing
some
sort
of
complaint
under
title
iv,
which
would
be
the
subject
of
legal
proceeding.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
investigation
or
even
mention
other
than
the
certification
that
the
results
were
valid
and
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
andrew
jackson
now
held
office
for
the
constitutional
term.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
unless
the
court
in
its
discretion
would
wish
to
consider
the
merits
and
that
is
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
widen
the
basis
of
the
complaint.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
if
the
case
is
just
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
the
case
as
moot
it
will
not
become
necessary
to
get
to
that
issue
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
held
it
moot,
did
not
get
to
that
issue.
but
let
me
address
--
mr.
chief
justice
permit
me
to
address
myself
to
the,
to
this
question
of
exhaustion
for
just
a
moment.
in
the
event
the
court
should
hold
the
action
as
not
moot,
there
does
remain
this
question
and
it
was
the
subject
of
some
examples
--
some
questions
from
the
bench
yesterday.
i
need
to
repeat
the
dial's
complaint,
the
incumbent
business
representative,
his
complaint
to
his
union
and
to
the
secretary
was
a
very
limited
one.
he
asked
the
union
only
really
to
give
him
back
his
job
because
he
had
been
defeated.
he
asked
the
secretary
to
investigate
an
election
held
july
13
at
local
125.
this
was
all
the
relief
he
wanted,
but
the
secretary's
legal
action
was
a
broad
complaint
based
upon
the
alleged
irregularities
of
june
and
the
alleged
irregularities
of
july.
now,
the
statutory
language
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors
which
is
set
forth
in
the
amicus
brief
of
afl-cio
shows
in
our
judgment
conclusively
that
the
secretary
exceeded
his
authority.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
quite
clear
in
section
402
that
it
is
a
member
who
has
exhausted
his
internal
remedies
and
only
then
may
he
file
with
the
secretary,
may
complain
alleging
a
violation
of
section
401.
the
secretary
investigates
such
complaint,
not
any
complaint
or
all
complaints
but
such
complain
and
then
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
the
violation
occurred,
he
brings
the
civil
action
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election.
the
secretary
may
vindicate
only
what
the
members
complained
of
and
shown
to
exist
and
he's
limited,
in
our
judgment,
to
the
member's
complaint.
dial
intended,
there
is
question
about,
this
was
made
abundantly
clear
at
the
hearing
accorded
to
him
by
the
international
union,
there
is
no
question
that
he
intended
to
protest
his
own
defeat
and
loss
of
office
and
it
is
exhaustion
of
that
one
issue,
did
not
furnish
the
necessary
predicate
for
the
secretary
to
go
in
and
seek
to
set
aside
the
june
election
never
challenged
or
the
other
irregularities
allegedly
uncovered.
if
there
is
any
theme
that
seems
to
me
which
appears
throughout
the
legislative
history,
is
the
congressional
concern
for
exhaustion.
there
may
have
been
other
legislative
differences
as
to
how
to
approach
the
problem.
there
were
differences
of
opinion
in
the
senate
bills
and
house
bills,
but
one
thing
does
appear.
all
of
the
legislators
agree
that
the
primary
basic
predicate
was
exhaust
remedy
and
then
complain
to
the
secretary.
this
is
important.
the
self
discipline
and
habits
created
by
international
unions
in
according
to
complaining
members,
through
hearing
panels
an
opportunity
to
disclose
their
complaint,
the
development
of
an
informed
leadership
and
an
alert
and
aware
membership
is
fostered
by
these
internal
unions
processes.
now
in
answer
to
a
question
yesterday
put
to
mr.
claiborne
by
mr.
justice
black,
in
substance,
“once
a
complaint
is
made,
do
you
uncover
the
entire
area?”
and
mr.
claiborne
if
i
recall
correctly
said,
“yes,
this
is
the
rule
which
we
wish
to
apply
and
we
need
laboratory
election.
we
cannot
accept
this,
what
i
call,
a
trigger
theory.
the
adoption
of
this
theory
means
that
once
a
union
rejects
a
limited
complaint
by
a
member,
there
maybe
no
justice
for
it
and
no
substantial
basis
for
the
complaint,
but
the
secretary
then
may
conduct
a
free-wheeling
investigation,
file
a
complaint,
covering
violations
never
even
thought
of
by
the
member
or
complained
of
and
considered
by
the
international
union.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
and
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
that's
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
comprehended
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
provided
that
the
member
must
exhaust
the
compliant
and
it
is
his
complaint
upon
which
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
proceed.
may
i
just
say
that
the
analogy
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
not
well
drawn.
we
have
a
totally
different
statute
for
a
totally
different
purpose.
the
two
are
--
do
not
go
down
parallel
paths
at
all.
under
the
labor
act,
anyone
can
file
a
charge,
investigate
it,
if
necessary
may
be
amended,
and
then
the
complaint
issue.
under
a
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
only
a
member
may
file
a
charge.
there
is
a
requirement,
precise
requirement
of
exhaustion
in
the
statute.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
it's
more
than
that.
i
think
by
exhaustion,
it's
meant
a
full
and
adequate
opportunity
to
appear
before
some
union
appellate
board.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
if
they
find
what
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
then
the
union
would
then,
if
it's
faced
with
an
election,
it
would
uphold
the
appeals
and
direct
another
election
for
that
office.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
there
is
a
complete
appellant
procedure,
a
very
detailed
appellant
procedure
in
the
international
union
for
just
this
thing.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
the
detailed
deliberate
appellant
procedure
and
what
happens
when
cases
are
appealed
and
the
action
taken
by
the
international
union.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
it
is
our
position
that
the
secretary
is
limited
generally
to
nature
of
the
complaint
filed
by
the
individual
member
your
honor,
that
he
cannot
go
beyond
it
to
get
into
something
which
is
quite
apart
from
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
to
other
ground.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
but
mr.
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
do
sir;
i
think
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice.
congress
did
not
want
to
establish
the
secretary
as
a
trustee
or
administer
the
affairs
of
the
union.
congress
wanted
to
give
to
the
local
unions
as
much
independence
and
autonomy
as
possible
and
depend
upon
the
union
member
to
exercise
his
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
well
not
altogether
sir.
mr.
justice
black
i
come
back
to
section
601,
which
i
think
is
so
powerful
and
its
deterrent
effect
that
if
a
member
files
no
complaint,
the
secretary
still
has
ample
authority
to
disclose
every
irregularity
that
maybe
uncovered
and
i
must
repeat
the
--
this
is
a
disclosure
act
mr.
justice
black
and
the
effect
of
disclosure
upon
the
trade
union
membership
is
indeed
a
powerful
one
and
a
costly
one
and
one
which
the
trade
union
movement
cannot
sustain.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is
the
congressional
--
is
the
statute
in
what
congress
intended.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
have
the
secretary
conduct
or
interfere
with
the
internal
administration
of
unions.
congress
wanted
local
unions
to
establish
standards
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
to
accord
every
member
of
that
union
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
a
considered
judgment
upon
his
appeal,
but
to
leave
so
far
as
possible
the
government
out
of
the
business
of
administering
the
affairs
of
local
unions.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
it's
more
than
broad
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
601
does
not
give
the
secretary,
that's
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
claiborne.
this
case
your
honors
involves
election
under
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
in
which
cecil
dial
(ph)
the
union’s
incumbent
business
representative
was
defeated
in
his
campaign
for
reelection
by
andrew
jackson,
his
rank
and
file
opponent.
dial
protested
of
his
defeat
only
to
the
international
union.
his
protest
was
denied.
he
complained
again
to
the
secretary
about
his
defeat
only
and
eventually
a
supervised
election
was
directed
by
the
district
court.
simultaneously
were
the
regular
1966
scheduled
union
election
and
dial
was
again
defeated.
the
secretary
now
seeks
to
set
aside
the
1963
election
of
officers,
which
was
never
protested
or
challenged
and
those
terms
have
long
expired
and
to
expunge
the
untainted
1966
election,
which
was
never
challenged.
we
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
warrant
what
has
been
referred
to
as
laboratory
election
or
the
remedial
intervention
of
the
secretary
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
they
are
triennial
elections
your
honor.
the
next
scheduled
election
would
be
in
1969.
if
you
were
to
agree
with
the
secretary,
another
election
under
the
secretary's
supervision
would
be
conducted.
the
individuals
now
in
office
would
be
presumably,
if
defeated,
removed
from
office
and
other
individuals
would
come
in.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
some
change
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
a
change
in
the
trustees.
there
was
a
change
in
the
president.
the
1966
election
elected
a
new
president.
of
course
the
business
representative
is
now
different.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
the
union
held
its
regular
triennial
election
in
june
of
1963.
all
nine
officers
except
that
of
business
representative
were
filled.
here
a
tie
resulted
between
dial,
the
incumbent
who
had
been
in
office
for
sometime
and
andrew
jackson,
his
rank
and
file
opponent.
this
election
was
not
challenged,
but
because
of
the
tie,
it
became
necessary
to
conduct
a
runoff
election
in
july
of
1963.
this
runoff
election
like
the
predecessor
election
in
june
was
supervised
by
a
secretly
elected
rank
and
file
committee
of
election
judges.
dial
lost
this
election,
the
runoff
election
to
jackson
by
some
19
votes.
he
filed
a
timely
protest
only
about
his
loss
of
the
job.
he
was
not
concerned
about
any
other
officer,
but
only
about
himself
and
he
intended
only
to
protest
his
own
defeat.
dial
was
accorded
a
full
hearing
by
the
international,
a
complete
hearing,
on
notice.
he
was
present.
the
union
representatives
were
present.
a
full
inquiry
was
made
and
it
was
made
clear
to
the
international
hearing
panel
that
dial
was
protesting
only
his
own
defeat.
he
was
not
concerned
about
anything
else.
because
dial
was
unable
to
substantiate
the
proof
that
enough
ineligible
members
voted
to
affect
the
election
result,
the
international
denied
his
protest.
he
then
made
a
timely
appeal
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
conducted
an
investigation.
this
investigation
or
the
results
of
the
investigation
were
made
known
to
the
international
union.
the
secretary
claimed
that
he
had
in
the
investigation
uncovered
irregularities
in
the
june
election
as
well
as
in
the
runoff
election
and
was
therefore
asking
the
international
union
to
set
aside
both
the
june
regular
election
and
the
july
runoff
election.
the
international
union
questioned
the
secretary's
jurisdiction
to
set
aside
an
election
which
had
never
been
protested
and
which
had
not
been
considered
by
the
international
union
in
its
hearing's
panel,
but
did
say
to
the
secretary
that
if
proof
of
irregularities
in
the
runoff
could
be
further
substantiated,
it
would
reopen
its
record
and
again
consider
the
runoff
election.
within
a
week
or
ten
days
after
that,
the
secretary
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
of
northern
district
of
ohio.
now
two
questions
it
seems
to
me
your
honors
are
presented
in
this
posture.
did
the
intervening
election
in
1966,
held
in
conjunction
or
connection
with
the
supervised
election
for
business
representative
moot
this
case
and
in
any
event,
we
submit
it
may
have
been
further
mooted
because
the
international
in
october
1966
after
the
appeal
had
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
amended
its
constitution
to
prevent
in
the
future
any
occurrence
of
this
nature.
but
if
the
court
should
hold
the
election
as
not
moot,
then
there
is
a
further
issue
before
perhaps
and
that
is
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
include
violations
not
complained
of
by
any
union
member
and
never
considered
by
the
union
and
whether
the
secretary
has
a
free-wheeling
investigation
upon
which
he
can
uncover
any
violation
never
complained
of
by
a
member
or
never
considered
by
the
union
and
file
a
complaint
based
upon
that.
now
these
issues
arise
because
filing
--
following
the
filing
of
the
secretaries
broadened
complaint,
a
motion
was
made
in
the
district
court
to
dismiss
all
allegations
of
the
complaint
pertaining
to
the
june
in
1963
election.
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion
claiming
that
the
member
had
never
exhausted
any
remedies
concerning
the
june
election.
no
protest
concerning
the
june
election
had
been
made
by
any
member
to
the
international.
the
international
had
never
considered
it
and
under
the
language
of
the
statute
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
to
entertain
a
complaint
based
upon
those
allegations.
now
almost
two
years
later
and
i
think
mr.
claiborne
yesterday
perhaps
inadvertently
created
the
inference
that
this
happened
right
after
the
district
court
had
come
down
with
its
motion
to
dismiss,
but
almost
two
years
later
in
april
1966,
the
district
court
judge
battisti
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
remaining
portions
of
the
complaint
dealing
only
with
the
runoff
election
concerning
which
there
had
been
a
protest,
concerning
which
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
concerning
which
the
secretary
had
under
the
statute
conducted
his
investigation.
summary
judgment
was
granted
with
respect
to
that.
the
district
court
judge
battisti,
in
his
decision
of
april
1966
recognizing
the
imminence
of
the
oncoming
june
1966
election
and
the
practical
problems
that
would
be
raised,
directed
that
the
supervised
election
for
business
representative
be
conducted
at
the
same
time
as
the
regular
election.
and
so
representatives
of
the
department
of
labor
and
union
representatives
met
and
laid
out
the
details
of
the
supervised
election.
now
this
was
no
casual
meeting
your
honors.
this
was
a
detailed,
deliberate,
considered
arrangement
of
all
of
the
details
that
go
into
a
union
election
even
down
to
and
including
the
color
of
the
ballot
that
would
be
used.
so
on
july
11,
1966
the
government
got
its
supervised
election,
department
of
labor
representatives
were
present,
the
other
officers
were
filled
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir,
there
was
a
separate
ballot
used.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
a
different
colored
ballot
was
used
for
the
supervised
election
for
business
representatives.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
don't
know
your
honor
the
answer
to
that,
but
there
were
separate
ballot
boxes,
a
separate
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
now
dial
again
lost
this
election,
but
the
day
before
the
election
on
july
10,
one
day
before
this
election,
the
secretary
appealed,
court
of
appeals
from
both
judge
connell's
order
of
july
1964
and
judge
battisti's
order
of
april
1966,
the
union
moved
to
dismiss,
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
union's
motion
agreed
with
it
that
the
supervening
event,
the
supervening
event
in
1966,
the
regular
election
occurring
simultaneously
with
a
supervised
election
rendered
the
secretary's
case
moot.
i
may
say
at
this
time
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
white
raised
yesterday,
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence,
not
a
scintilla
of
an
inference
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
regular
election
in
1966.
it's
clean,
absolutely
clean
and
i
think
mr.
claiborne
must
concede
that.
now
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
is
a
unified
scheme
to
protect
the
rights
and
interests
of
union
members
and
the
public.
i
think
there
has
been
a
lack
of
presentation,
if
i
may
say
so,
concerning
both
the
structure
and
the
content
of
the
statute
which
this
court
must
consider.
under
section
402,
on
complaint
of
a
union
member,
it
must
be
a
union
member,
the
secretary
after
investigation
may
bring
a
civil
action
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election,
not
a
later
election,
not
any
other
election,
but
the
election
found
to
be
invalid.
in
the
meantime
pending
this
conclusion,
the
election
even
though
challenged
is
presumed
to
be
valid.
it
allows
the
elected
officers
to
continue
to
function.
this
i
think
was
a
deliberate
choice
congress
made
rather
than
move,
remove
the
challenged
official.
somebody
had
to
run
this
union
or
the
union
and
they
were
permitted
to
remain
so
that
the
affairs
would
not
descend
into
chaos.
but
it's
the
election
or
the
election
contest
that
was
challenged,
that's
investigated
and
whereupon
trial
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
it
reveals
that
a
violation
may
have
occurred
then
a
court
is
then
authorized
to
declare
the
election
void
in
the
conduct
of
a
new
election.
thus
in
1966,
when
the
union
officers
who
had
been
elected
in
1963
completed
their
terms
of
office,
the
secretary's
action
was
moot,
these
terms
of
office
had
expired.
resulting
from
the
invalid,
unchallenged
election,
the
terms
of
office
had
expired
and
the
allegedly
invalid,
unchallenged
election
was
over.
the
officers
who
were
now
holding
office
in
1966
came
in
as
a
result
of
an
unchallenged,
un-protested
election.
no
purpose
would
be
served
now
by
an
order
in
1967
or
perhaps
in
1968
to
conduct
a
wholly
new
supervised
election.
the
secretary
has
had
his
supervision.
he
has
had
his
supervised
election,
and
the
only
effect
seems
to
me
of
a
supervised
election
at
this
time
would
be
to
remove
or
to
set-aside
the
election
of
those
elected
in
1963
whose
terms
of
office
have
expired
and
the
practical
effect
would
be
the
un-seeding
of
those
who
were
elected
in
1966.
there
has
been
no
mention
in
the
presentation
of
the
case
as
far
as
section
601,
and
if
the
contention
were
to
be
made
that
this
is
to
declare
this
action
moot
is
a
serious
hamper
upon
the
effective
administration
of
the
statute
by
the
secretary.
i
would
call
to
court's
attention
section
601
of
the
statute.
here
under
this
section,
the
secretary
has
given
a
broad
plenary
power
to
conduct
investigations
from
top
to
bottom.
there
need
be
no
challenge.
there
need
be
no
complaint
and
if
the
secretary's
representatives
who
were
present
in
the
union
hall
in
youngstown
on
july
11,
1966
had
any
cause
to
believe
there
was
anything
unregular
about
that
election
under
section
601
without
a
complaint,
they
could
have
disclosed
every
wrongdoing,
but
nothing
was
forthcoming.
and
because
of
this
latitude,
if
this
case
were
to
be
declared
moot,
no
undue
burden
is
placed
upon
the
secretary
in
the
effective
administration
of
the
statute.
moreover
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
gist
of
the
complaint
here
was
that
some
50
to
60
ineligible
members
voted,
and
some
15
or
16
ineligible
members
were
candidates
for
office.
this
is
because
of
a
strict
interpretation
placed
by
the
secretary
upon
the
constitution.
it's
because
of
that
strict
interpretation
placed
upon
it
and
that
the
union
in
october
1966,
the
international
union
in
october
1966
amended
its
constitution.
so
that
from
now
on
in
when
the
member
pays,
if
a
member
fails
to
pay
his
dues
on
the
first
day
of
the
month,
and
if
they
are
not
paid
by
the
last
day
of
the
next
following
month
then
that
member
shall
be
subject
to
be
suspended
by
the
international.
but
as
long
as
he
as
paid
his
dues
and
has
not
been
suspended
by
the
international
union,
he
has
the
franchise
and
he
can
go
in
and
cast
his
ballot
and
he
will
not
be
denied
the
privilege
of
voting.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
the
secretary's
remedy
under
section
601
mr.
justice
fortas
is
to
conduct
investigations
to
subpoena
records
to
go
into
every
conceivable
aspect
of
the
union's
conduct.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
oh!
the
remedy?
the
remedy,
your
honor,
would
be
public
disclosure.
it
would
be
a
report
to
the
member.
it
seems
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
no,
no
sir,
no
your
honor,
no.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
public
disclosure,
the
inherent
and
deterrent
power
of
public
disclosure
is
a
rather
powerful
weapon.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
not,
not,
no
your
honor,
not
the
equivalent
of
a
legal
proceeding
but
i
cannot
overlook
the
powerful
deterrent
effect
on
the
union
move
of
a
disclosure
concerning
any
irregularities.
i
am
sure
that
this
would
cause
the
members
to
respond
by
then
filing
some
sort
of
complaint
under
title
iv,
which
would
be
the
subject
of
legal
proceeding.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
investigation
or
even
mention
other
than
the
certification
that
the
results
were
valid
and
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
andrew
jackson
now
held
office
for
the
constitutional
term.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
unless
the
court
in
its
discretion
would
wish
to
consider
the
merits
and
that
is
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
widen
the
basis
of
the
complaint.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
if
the
case
is
just
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
the
case
as
moot
it
will
not
become
necessary
to
get
to
that
issue
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
held
it
moot,
did
not
get
to
that
issue.
but
let
me
address
--
mr.
chief
justice
permit
me
to
address
myself
to
the,
to
this
question
of
exhaustion
for
just
a
moment.
in
the
event
the
court
should
hold
the
action
as
not
moot,
there
does
remain
this
question
and
it
was
the
subject
of
some
examples
--
some
questions
from
the
bench
yesterday.
i
need
to
repeat
the
dial's
complaint,
the
incumbent
business
representative,
his
complaint
to
his
union
and
to
the
secretary
was
a
very
limited
one.
he
asked
the
union
only
really
to
give
him
back
his
job
because
he
had
been
defeated.
he
asked
the
secretary
to
investigate
an
election
held
july
13
at
local
125.
this
was
all
the
relief
he
wanted,
but
the
secretary's
legal
action
was
a
broad
complaint
based
upon
the
alleged
irregularities
of
june
and
the
alleged
irregularities
of
july.
now,
the
statutory
language
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors
which
is
set
forth
in
the
amicus
brief
of
afl-cio
shows
in
our
judgment
conclusively
that
the
secretary
exceeded
his
authority.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
quite
clear
in
section
402
that
it
is
a
member
who
has
exhausted
his
internal
remedies
and
only
then
may
he
file
with
the
secretary,
may
complain
alleging
a
violation
of
section
401.
the
secretary
investigates
such
complaint,
not
any
complaint
or
all
complaints
but
such
complain
and
then
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
the
violation
occurred,
he
brings
the
civil
action
to
set
aside
the
invalid
election.
the
secretary
may
vindicate
only
what
the
members
complained
of
and
shown
to
exist
and
he's
limited,
in
our
judgment,
to
the
member's
complaint.
dial
intended,
there
is
question
about,
this
was
made
abundantly
clear
at
the
hearing
accorded
to
him
by
the
international
union,
there
is
no
question
that
he
intended
to
protest
his
own
defeat
and
loss
of
office
and
it
is
exhaustion
of
that
one
issue,
did
not
furnish
the
necessary
predicate
for
the
secretary
to
go
in
and
seek
to
set
aside
the
june
election
never
challenged
or
the
other
irregularities
allegedly
uncovered.
if
there
is
any
theme
that
seems
to
me
which
appears
throughout
the
legislative
history,
is
the
congressional
concern
for
exhaustion.
there
may
have
been
other
legislative
differences
as
to
how
to
approach
the
problem.
there
were
differences
of
opinion
in
the
senate
bills
and
house
bills,
but
one
thing
does
appear.
all
of
the
legislators
agree
that
the
primary
basic
predicate
was
exhaust
remedy
and
then
complain
to
the
secretary.
this
is
important.
the
self
discipline
and
habits
created
by
international
unions
in
according
to
complaining
members,
through
hearing
panels
an
opportunity
to
disclose
their
complaint,
the
development
of
an
informed
leadership
and
an
alert
and
aware
membership
is
fostered
by
these
internal
unions
processes.
now
in
answer
to
a
question
yesterday
put
to
mr.
claiborne
by
mr.
justice
black,
in
substance,
“once
a
complaint
is
made,
do
you
uncover
the
entire
area?”
and
mr.
claiborne
if
i
recall
correctly
said,
“yes,
this
is
the
rule
which
we
wish
to
apply
and
we
need
laboratory
election.
we
cannot
accept
this,
what
i
call,
a
trigger
theory.
the
adoption
of
this
theory
means
that
once
a
union
rejects
a
limited
complaint
by
a
member,
there
maybe
no
justice
for
it
and
no
substantial
basis
for
the
complaint,
but
the
secretary
then
may
conduct
a
free-wheeling
investigation,
file
a
complaint,
covering
violations
never
even
thought
of
by
the
member
or
complained
of
and
considered
by
the
international
union.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
and
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
that's
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
comprehended
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
provided
that
the
member
must
exhaust
the
compliant
and
it
is
his
complaint
upon
which
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
proceed.
may
i
just
say
that
the
analogy
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
not
well
drawn.
we
have
a
totally
different
statute
for
a
totally
different
purpose.
the
two
are
--
do
not
go
down
parallel
paths
at
all.
under
the
labor
act,
anyone
can
file
a
charge,
investigate
it,
if
necessary
may
be
amended,
and
then
the
complaint
issue.
under
a
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
only
a
member
may
file
a
charge.
there
is
a
requirement,
precise
requirement
of
exhaustion
in
the
statute.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
it's
more
than
that.
i
think
by
exhaustion,
it's
meant
a
full
and
adequate
opportunity
to
appear
before
some
union
appellate
board.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
if
they
find
what
sir?
mr.
mortimer
riemer
then
the
union
would
then,
if
it's
faced
with
an
election,
it
would
uphold
the
appeals
and
direct
another
election
for
that
office.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
there
is
a
complete
appellant
procedure,
a
very
detailed
appellant
procedure
in
the
international
union
for
just
this
thing.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
the
detailed
deliberate
appellant
procedure
and
what
happens
when
cases
are
appealed
and
the
action
taken
by
the
international
union.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
it
is
our
position
that
the
secretary
is
limited
generally
to
nature
of
the
complaint
filed
by
the
individual
member
your
honor,
that
he
cannot
go
beyond
it
to
get
into
something
which
is
quite
apart
from
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
to
other
ground.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
but
mr.
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
do
sir;
i
think
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice.
congress
did
not
want
to
establish
the
secretary
as
a
trustee
or
administer
the
affairs
of
the
union.
congress
wanted
to
give
to
the
local
unions
as
much
independence
and
autonomy
as
possible
and
depend
upon
the
union
member
to
exercise
his
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
well
not
altogether
sir.
mr.
justice
black
i
come
back
to
section
601,
which
i
think
is
so
powerful
and
its
deterrent
effect
that
if
a
member
files
no
complaint,
the
secretary
still
has
ample
authority
to
disclose
every
irregularity
that
maybe
uncovered
and
i
must
repeat
the
--
this
is
a
disclosure
act
mr.
justice
black
and
the
effect
of
disclosure
upon
the
trade
union
membership
is
indeed
a
powerful
one
and
a
costly
one
and
one
which
the
trade
union
movement
cannot
sustain.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is
the
congressional
--
is
the
statute
in
what
congress
intended.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
have
the
secretary
conduct
or
interfere
with
the
internal
administration
of
unions.
congress
wanted
local
unions
to
establish
standards
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
to
accord
every
member
of
that
union
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
a
considered
judgment
upon
his
appeal,
but
to
leave
so
far
as
possible
the
government
out
of
the
business
of
administering
the
affairs
of
local
unions.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
it's
more
than
broad
your
honor.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
601
does
not
give
the
secretary,
that's
right.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
