mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
again
we
are
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
here
is
not
disputed.
the
charge
here
is
in
some
sense
the
reverse
of
that
in
the
previous
case.
it
is
the
delinquent
members
of
the
union
who
under
the
union's
constitution
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates.
some
of
them
were
allowed
under
practice
of
the
secretary
treasurer
to
vote
and
to
be
candidates.
this
was
done
by
paying
for
them
the
portion
of
the
dues
which
they
owe
to
the
international
which
made
them
appear
as
members
in
good
standing
and
therefore
qualify
both
to
vote
and
to
be
candidates.
this
practice
was
followed
unilaterally
by
the
local
secretary
treasurer
without
any
authorization
from
the
international
union
and
it
was
done
on
ad
hoc
basis,
it
was
done
for
some
and
not
for
others.
it
is
done,
so
the
secretary
treasurer
testified,
out
of
a
sense
of
generosity
for
those
members
who
had
been
out
work.
he
added
that
it
was
only
done
for
those
who
had
been
long
time
members
of
the
local.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
was
paid
not
out
of
his
pocket
but
out
of
the
local's
treasury
quite
right,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
paid
out
of
the
local's
treasury
not
out
of
the
secretary
treasurer's
own
pocket.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
i
suppose
was
clearly
misuse
of
local
union
funds,
but
that
of
course
is
not
basis
of
our
complaint
here.
we
challenged
it
successfully
as
being
both
a
violation
of
the
local
constitution
of
a
valid
requirement
of
the
local
constitution
which
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
and
secondly
as
the
imposition
of
a
qualification
not
uniformly
and
therefore
for
that
reason
also
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
opportunities
for
discrimination
in
this
sort
of
scheme
are
too
obvious.
we'd
have
to
elaborate,
but
as
i
say
the
invalidity
of
this
practice
in
any
event
is
conceded
and
was
so
found
by
the
district
court.
now
this
practice
which
resulted
in
the
both
the
voting
and
the
running
for
office
of
persons
who
had
no
right
to
do
so
prevailed
both
at
the
general
election
of
offices
in
this
union
in
june
of
1953
and
at
a
runoff
held
a
month
and
half
later
in
july
in
1963.
at
the
june
general
election
it
apparently
resulted
in
having
some
50
ineligible
members
voting
and
having
some
16
ineligible
members
running
as
candidates,
some
of
them
were
successful.
what
triggered
this
suit
however
was
the
tie
which
resulted
for
the
office
of
business
representative.
as
it
turned
out
our
complainant,
the
man
who
complained
to
the
secretary,
was
running
against
two
opponents
both
of
whom
were
ineligible
and
the
tie
resulted
also
from
the
casting
of
ineligible
votes.
our
man
now
complained
internally.
however,
the
only
thing
he
complained
about
was
the
casting
of
ineligible
ballots
at
the
runoff
held
in
july.
he
didn't
know
apparently
that
his
opponent
was
ineligible
to
be
a
candidate,
we
assume
he
would
complain
about
that,
the
most
obvious
flaw
in
that
runoff,
nor
did
he
complain
about
the
june
general
election
which
had
produced
the
tie
vote
and
had
made
the
runoff
necessary.
at
least
he
didn't
expressly
complain
about
anything
except
the
illegal
votes
that
have
been
cast
at
the
runoff.
what's
more
he
said
that
there
were
nine
illegal
votes
cast
at
the
runoff
and
he'd
lost
by
some
19
votes.
therefore
the
union
internal
appeal
machine
denied
his
protest
on
the
ground
that
those
nine
votes
couldn't
have
made
any
difference.
at
this
point
our
defeated
candidate
for
business
representative
a
complaint
to
the
secretary,
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
having
exhausted
his
internal
unit
remedy,
again
he
told
the
secretary
that
he
was
complaining
about
the
casting
of
illegal
ballots.
he
said
he
was
complaining
about
the
runoff.
he
made
reference
to
protest
internally
and
i
think
fairly
one
should
say
that
all
he
pinpointed
was
the
casting
of
illegal
votes
at
the
runoff.
however
when
the
secretary
investigated
he
very
promptly
found
that
this
was
not
the
only
illegality,
not
only
had
there
been
illegal
votes
cast
at
the
runoff,
but
the
same
practice
had
prevailed
at
the
general
election
a
month
earlier
with
a
result
that
illegal
votes
have
been
cast
there
as
well
and
further
more
illegal
candidates
had
been
allowed
to
run,
including
our
complainants
to
opponents,
including
the
one
who
ultimately
prevailed
for
business
representative.
now
all
this
was
developed
by
the
secretary
within
10
days
after
the
complaint
was
made
to
him.
in
a
very
frank
and
complete
statement
or
confession
by
the
secretary
treasurer
who
explained
his
practice
that
had
been
going
on
the
in
the
union
in
the
local
for
many
years
before
his
time
and
then
he'd
simply
followed
it.
and
that
affidavit
in
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
the
secretary
treasurer
before
signing
a
statement
had
communicated
with
the
international.
so
we
have
reason
to
believe
the
international
knew
the
full
facts
and
not
nearly
the
allegation
about
nine
illegal
votes
within
10
days
after
the
secretary
had
notice.
but
in
any
event
the
next
month
the
secretary
formally
wrote
to
union
advising
them
precisely
as
to
what
irregularities
his
investigation
had
turned
out
and
these
included
illegal
votes
at
both
elections,
illegal
candidates
at
both
elections.
and
illegal
votes
i
should
add
sufficient
in
number
to
affect
the
outcome,
not
nine,
but
some
50
or
60
which
would
or
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
runoff
election
for
business
representative.
now
there
was
a
--
in
answer
to
this
communication
from
the
secretary
the
union
took
the
adamant
position
that
it
would
not
investigate,
discuss,
talk
about
anything
except
the
charges
made
with
respect
to
the
runoff.
nobody
talk
about
the
charges
made
with
respect
to
the
runoff
expect
as
it
affected
illegal
votes,
it
would
say
nothing
about
illegal
candidates
because
that
was
all
that
had
been
included
in
the
member's
protest
when
it
was
made
to
the
union
in
another
time.
there
was
a
fruitless
conference
between
the
secretary
and
president
of
the
international
union
and
shortly
thereafter
the
secretary
filed
a
suit.
immediately,
well,
i
don't
know
how
soon
after
the
filing
of
the
suit,
the
union
moved
to
dismiss
those
portions
of
the
suit
which
had
anything
except
the
runoff
in
july
of
1963
on
the
ground
that
as
to
the
general
election
there
had
been
no
internal
protest
and
no
exhaustion
of
internal
remedies
and
therefore
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
look
into
that
earlier
general
election.
although
of
course
the
earlier
general
election
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
runoff
the
time
of
which
it
produced
the
runoff.
that
motion
to
dismiss
this
part
of
the
complaint
was
sustained
by
the
district
judge
on
the
grounds
i've
indicated.
at
this
point,
the
secretary
on
the
basis
of
admissions
and
answers
to
interrogatories
moved
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
runoff
asking
that
the
court
direct
at
least
a
rerun
of
that
runoff
election
for
the
office
of
business
representative
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
since
there
had
been
clear
violations
of
the
act
and
since
those
violations
has
obviously,
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
of
election.
the
district
judge
agreed
and
did
enter
that
order.
the
district
judge
noticed
that
there
were
58
illegal
ballots
cast
in
this
runoff
which
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
and
that
it
said
was
reason
enough
to
require
a
rerun
of
that
particular
election.
the
district
judge
also
addressed
himself
to
the
question
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
with
respect
to
illegal
candidates
running,
but
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
that
question
and
expressed
some
doubt
whether
that
was
before
it
since
that
complaint
had
not
been
made
internally
through
the
union.
by
this
time
although
the
suit
was
filed
in
early
1964
where
in
april
of
1966
the
--
in
this
union
elections
every
three
years
as
opposed
to
two
years
as
in
the
prior
case
and
the
june
1966
regular
elections
were
impending
when
the
district
judge
issued
his
order.
so
he
provided
that
at
those
regular
elections
the
secretary
would
supervise
that
aspect
of
the
election
that
went
to
the
office
of
business
representative
but
not
the
rest
of
the
election
for
the
remaining
offices
and
that
those
elected
then
would
hold
office
for
the
following
three
years.
this
is
an
effort
common
in
the
district
courts
to
avoid
an
unnecessary
disruption
of
the
local
union's
regular
schedules
of
elections
rather
than
have
a
man
elected
for
two
or
three
months
and
then
have
to
rerun
the
election
again,
the
judge
made
this
sensible
accommodation
with
the
no
objection
from
the
secretary.
in
june
1966,
the
regular
elections
were
held,
the
secretary
did
supervise
that
portion
of
it,
which
related
to
business
representative
although
not
the
other
portion.
an
appeal
had
been
filed
by
him
to
the
sixth
circuit,
but
a
day
or
so
thereafter
these
intervening
elections
occurred
and
sixth
circuit
following
the
second
and
in
accord
with
the
third
circuit
of
the
prior
case
dismissed
the
secretary's
suit
or
ordered
it
dismissed
as
mooted
by
this
supervening
election.
accordingly,
it
reached
no
other
issue
of
the
case.
now
here
of
course
as
in
the
prior
case,
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
supervening
election
mooted
the
secretary's
request
for
an
order
directing
laboratory
election
or
a
supervised
election.
i
see
no
occasion
to
repeat
what
i
said
in
the
prior
case
on
that
score.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reasons
there
apply
fully
here
and
that
is
true
although
here
we
don't
know
whether
in
fact
there
were
any
irregularities
in
june
1966
when
the
supervening
election
occurred.
but
if
the
remedy
of
laboratory
election
is
ever
important
if
it
ever
serves
any
purpose
that
purpose,
you
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
holding
of
an
unsupervised
election.
by
definition
an
unsupervised
election
will
not
do
service
for
a
supervised
elections.
there
must
be
some
point
in
having
an
laboratory
election
and
that
point
cannot
be
defeated,
that
purpose
cannot
be
frustrated
by
the
accident
that
an
unsupervised
election
has
occurred
in
the
interim.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
wouldn't
claim
that
we
did.
we
could
take
any
action
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
assert
that
there--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
reason
no
known
irregularity,
we
simply
do
not
know
whether
or
not
this
practice
had
been
eliminated
by
the
time
this
election
was
run.
we
do
know
of
course
that
it
did
not
prevail
any
part
of
the
election
that
was
for
the
business
representative
because
we
supervised
that.
it
is
said
that
while
we
supervised
that
we
in
fact
oversaw
the
whole
election
and
ought
to
be
in
a
position
to
know.
that
comes
rather
strangely
from
the
union,
which
so
strongly
resisted
our
supervising
the
entire
election.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
we
ought
to
draw
any
inference
from
that,
there
was
something
to
hide.
i
am
saying
that
there
must
be
a
difference
between
what
we
were
allowed
to
do
and
what
we
wanted
to
do
or
there
wouldn't
have
been
all
this
fight
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so,
yes
mr.
justice
white
and
i,
as
i
say
separate
questions
from
the
bench
i
have
no
intention
to
re-argue
about
question
of
mootness
this
in
this
case
which
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
precisely
the
same
question
as
was
presented
in
the
other
case.
it
is
a
question,
which
must
be
decided
favorably
to
us
for
us
to
--
for
the
court
to
reach
any
other
question
in
the
case.
now
the
other
question,
which
justifies
my
somewhat
long
winded
statement
of
facts
is
what
we
call
a
scope
of
complaint
issue.
again
the
scope
of
complaint
issue,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
secretary
is
restricted
when
he
files
his
suit
to
those
matters,
which
have
been
complained
about
by
the
union
member
when
he
filed
his
protest
in
the
union
or
whether
having
investigated
at
the
instance
of
a
union
member
and
having
discovered
additional
violation
of
the
act,
he
is
free,
as
would
be
true
in
the
labor
board
area
to
complaint
in
his
court
suit
on
those
additional
violations
as
well.
we
just
take
the
position
that
the
secretary
is
not
bound
to
restrict
his
suit
to
those
grounds
of
complaint,
which
have
been
articulated
by
the
member
when
he
complained
internally
to
the
union.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
that
particular
election,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
and
it
serves
as
a
trigger
and
it
serves
an
important
function.
the
reason
why
under
the
labor
act
as
well
as
under
this
act
of
proceedings
can
only
begin
upon
the
complaint
of
a
union
member
or
a
charging
party
in
this
case
the
labor
board,
is
to
assure
that
the
government
will
not
unnecessarily
intrude
into
irregularities,
which
are
at
so
little
moment
that
not
a
single
member
is
ready
to
complaint
about
it.
but
once
that
requirement
is
satisfied,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
the
labor
board
area,
then
the
general
counsel
or
the
board
is
free
to
investigate
all
of
the
related
charges
whether
or
not
they
have
been
pinpointed
by
the
charging
party
in
his
complaint
to
the
general
counsel
and
we
would
urge
the
same
rule
here.
now
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
under
the
labor
board
practice
there
is
no
requirement
of
exhausting
internal
remedies
whereas
here
concededly
such
a
requirement
does
exist.
but
that
requirement
everybody
seems
to
agree
is
meant
to
serve
for
one
purpose
and
really
one
purpose
only,
that
is
to
afford
the
union
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
violation
to
clean
its
own
house
without
suffering
needles
governmental
interference.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
commit
the
secretary
to
go
beyond
the
complaint
filed
with
him
and
still
be
faithful
to
that
purpose
of
allowing
the
union
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
violation,
which
is
charged.
that's
obviously
true
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
union
member
says,
not
any
legal
votes
were
cast
in
the
runoff
and
he's
turned
down
because
that's
not
enough.
obviously
the
allegation
that
nine
illegal
votes
were
cast
alerts
the
union
that
it
may
have
been
50
and
not
nine.
even
the
district
judge
agreed
with
this
on
that
point.
but
the
allegation
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
suggested
distinction
between
the
case
in
which
the
violation
has
recurred
in
the
supervening
election.
in
this
case
all
we
know
it
did
not
recur.
the
suggestion
being
that
in
this
case,
secretary's
suit
is
mooted
because
there
has
intervened
a
clean
action
or
as
perhaps
in
the
previous
case
as
mr.
justice
fortas
put
it
the
gravamen
of
the
offense,
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
remains
because
the
taint
continued
through
the
second
election.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction
between
an
apparently
clean
supervening
election
and
equally
tainted
supervening
election,
although
appealing
at
first
is
both
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme
and
an
unworkable
basis
of
the
distinction.
as
to
the
statutory
scheme,
the
statute
might
have
provided
that
where
there
is
an
invalid
election
and
the
court
so
finds
then
the
court
shall
order
that
the
election
be
rerun
free
of
the
taint,
it
might
have
left
at
that.
it
did
not,
congress
did
not
choose
that
remedy
instead
of
which
it
said
the
election
shall
be
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary.
that
was
presumably
to
assure
not
only
that
this
particular
violation
would
be
eliminated
in
the
rerun,
but
that
other
violations,
new
violations
would
be
eliminated
if
they
were
to
reintroduced
at
this
rerun
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
insofar
as
the
complaint
read
it
was
limited
to
the
business
representative
election
that
has
been
corrected.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
the
limited
scope
of
the
original
protest,
we
argue
of
course
that,
that
protest
goes
not
only
to
the
rerun,
but
to
the
general
election
held
a
month
early
or
must
reasonably
be
viewed
as
going
to.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
assuming,
as
i
must
to
answer
your
question
that
secretary
may
look
beyond
the
narrow
protest,
which
was
filed
internally
with
the
union
and
that
broader
complaint
is
sustained
for
that
purpose,
here
there
must
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court,
assuming
it
is
staying
that
is
the
june
1963
general
election
is
tainted
and
invalid.
there
is
no
need
for
an
order
setting
it
aside
since
it
has
been
superseded.
there
remains
a
need
for
a
new
election,
a
supervised
election
to
remove
the
taint,
which
it
seems
to
us
must
be
assumed
to
still
subsist.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
the
problem
of
the
term
of
office
is
the
same
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
intervening
election
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
original
election.
if
the
new
election
ordered
by
the
court
is
at
the
very
end
of
the
term
of
prior
election
the
courts
will
as
a
matter
of
accommodation
either
hold
the
election
then
and
make
the
term
three
years
and
two
months
or
will
wait
as
in
this
case
and
simply
delay
the
laboratory
election
until
the
regularly
scheduled
one
under
the
union's
counsel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
that
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
possible,
of
course
that
is
true
in
this
case
only
because
it
has
come
to
this
court
that
would
not
be
the
normal
situation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
are
in
no
position
to
make
that
decision
nor
we
can
say
the
contrary.
we
simply
don't
know
and
that's
the
problem
in
these
cases.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
did
not
supervise
it,
we
simply
don't
know.
now
if
it
was
in
fact
clean
and
whenever
the
election
attacked
is
about
to
be
overtaken,
the
union
has
a
very
simple
remedy
if
it's
going
to
run
a
clean
election
and
want
to
move
up
the
case.
it
is
free
to
really
move
the
case
by
agreeing
to
supervision.
it
tells
this
under
601
we
can
investigate
that
election
and
oversee
it
and
then
there
are
some
suggestion
that
oversight
is
really
the
same
supervision
that
supervise
it,
it
will
happy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
say
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
the
secretary
is
still
entitled
to
insist
on
an
laboratory
election
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
union
had
refused
to
voluntarily
withdraw
this
bylaw
before
the
next
election
had
occurred
or
before
the
secretary
had
filed
the
complaint
which
it
was
free
to
do,
it
doesn't
follow
that
secretary
will
insist
on
asserting
his
right.
the
secretary
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
us
comparable
to
the
law
of
injunction,
which
commits
an
injunction
to
be
issued
although
there
has
been
compliance
in
the
interim.
the
purpose
of
the
injunction
being
to
assure
that
it
will
not
occur
in
future.
now
in
the
case
put
by
justice
white
yesterday
where
the
violation
was
technical
of
isolated
nature,
not
likely
to
recur,
the
great
probabilities
are
that
if
that
particular
violation
is
eliminated
and
the
secretary
is
satisfied
that
the
intervening
election
is
in
all
other
respects
clean,
he
will
voluntarily
dismiss
his
complaint
and
not
insist
on
a
disrupt
--
a
new
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
say
the
case
has
not
moot
primarily
because
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
second
election
was
holy
clean,
you
really
need
a
new
trial
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
new
trial
before
the
district
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
secretary
is
satisfied
and
voluntarily
dismisses
the
suit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
duty
is
other
way.
the
duty
is
on
the
union
to
demonstrate
that
the
intervening
election
which
it
refused
to
allow
the
secretary
to
supervise,
is
in
fact
clean.
however,
there
maybe
instances
where
the
secretary
is
abusing
his
discretion
in
failing
to
dismiss
a
case.
in
that
instance
perhaps
the
district
court
as
it
would
in
an
injunction
case
not
because
of
mootness
but
because
of
want
of
equity
would
deny
relief
to
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
the
court
is
not
concerned
with
trifles,
will
not
grant
harsh
relief
when
the
violation
is
de
minimus
or
where
the
indication
of
any
recurrence
of
the
violation
are
insufficient.
we
do
concede
in
the
district
court
that
power,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
normal
remedy
is
laboratory
election.
that
is
the
remedy
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
except
where
the
secretary
waives
it
or
where
the
court
feels
it's
too
harsh
under
the
circumstances
it
ought
to
be
followed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
again
we
are
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
here
is
not
disputed.
the
charge
here
is
in
some
sense
the
reverse
of
that
in
the
previous
case.
it
is
the
delinquent
members
of
the
union
who
under
the
union's
constitution
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
vote
or
to
be
candidates.
some
of
them
were
allowed
under
practice
of
the
secretary
treasurer
to
vote
and
to
be
candidates.
this
was
done
by
paying
for
them
the
portion
of
the
dues
which
they
owe
to
the
international
which
made
them
appear
as
members
in
good
standing
and
therefore
qualify
both
to
vote
and
to
be
candidates.
this
practice
was
followed
unilaterally
by
the
local
secretary
treasurer
without
any
authorization
from
the
international
union
and
it
was
done
on
ad
hoc
basis,
it
was
done
for
some
and
not
for
others.
it
is
done,
so
the
secretary
treasurer
testified,
out
of
a
sense
of
generosity
for
those
members
who
had
been
out
work.
he
added
that
it
was
only
done
for
those
who
had
been
long
time
members
of
the
local.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
was
paid
not
out
of
his
pocket
but
out
of
the
local's
treasury
quite
right,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
paid
out
of
the
local's
treasury
not
out
of
the
secretary
treasurer's
own
pocket.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
i
suppose
was
clearly
misuse
of
local
union
funds,
but
that
of
course
is
not
basis
of
our
complaint
here.
we
challenged
it
successfully
as
being
both
a
violation
of
the
local
constitution
of
a
valid
requirement
of
the
local
constitution
which
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
and
secondly
as
the
imposition
of
a
qualification
not
uniformly
and
therefore
for
that
reason
also
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
opportunities
for
discrimination
in
this
sort
of
scheme
are
too
obvious.
we'd
have
to
elaborate,
but
as
i
say
the
invalidity
of
this
practice
in
any
event
is
conceded
and
was
so
found
by
the
district
court.
now
this
practice
which
resulted
in
the
both
the
voting
and
the
running
for
office
of
persons
who
had
no
right
to
do
so
prevailed
both
at
the
general
election
of
offices
in
this
union
in
june
of
1953
and
at
a
runoff
held
a
month
and
half
later
in
july
in
1963.
at
the
june
general
election
it
apparently
resulted
in
having
some
50
ineligible
members
voting
and
having
some
16
ineligible
members
running
as
candidates,
some
of
them
were
successful.
what
triggered
this
suit
however
was
the
tie
which
resulted
for
the
office
of
business
representative.
as
it
turned
out
our
complainant,
the
man
who
complained
to
the
secretary,
was
running
against
two
opponents
both
of
whom
were
ineligible
and
the
tie
resulted
also
from
the
casting
of
ineligible
votes.
our
man
now
complained
internally.
however,
the
only
thing
he
complained
about
was
the
casting
of
ineligible
ballots
at
the
runoff
held
in
july.
he
didn't
know
apparently
that
his
opponent
was
ineligible
to
be
a
candidate,
we
assume
he
would
complain
about
that,
the
most
obvious
flaw
in
that
runoff,
nor
did
he
complain
about
the
june
general
election
which
had
produced
the
tie
vote
and
had
made
the
runoff
necessary.
at
least
he
didn't
expressly
complain
about
anything
except
the
illegal
votes
that
have
been
cast
at
the
runoff.
what's
more
he
said
that
there
were
nine
illegal
votes
cast
at
the
runoff
and
he'd
lost
by
some
19
votes.
therefore
the
union
internal
appeal
machine
denied
his
protest
on
the
ground
that
those
nine
votes
couldn't
have
made
any
difference.
at
this
point
our
defeated
candidate
for
business
representative
a
complaint
to
the
secretary,
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
having
exhausted
his
internal
unit
remedy,
again
he
told
the
secretary
that
he
was
complaining
about
the
casting
of
illegal
ballots.
he
said
he
was
complaining
about
the
runoff.
he
made
reference
to
protest
internally
and
i
think
fairly
one
should
say
that
all
he
pinpointed
was
the
casting
of
illegal
votes
at
the
runoff.
however
when
the
secretary
investigated
he
very
promptly
found
that
this
was
not
the
only
illegality,
not
only
had
there
been
illegal
votes
cast
at
the
runoff,
but
the
same
practice
had
prevailed
at
the
general
election
a
month
earlier
with
a
result
that
illegal
votes
have
been
cast
there
as
well
and
further
more
illegal
candidates
had
been
allowed
to
run,
including
our
complainants
to
opponents,
including
the
one
who
ultimately
prevailed
for
business
representative.
now
all
this
was
developed
by
the
secretary
within
10
days
after
the
complaint
was
made
to
him.
in
a
very
frank
and
complete
statement
or
confession
by
the
secretary
treasurer
who
explained
his
practice
that
had
been
going
on
the
in
the
union
in
the
local
for
many
years
before
his
time
and
then
he'd
simply
followed
it.
and
that
affidavit
in
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
the
secretary
treasurer
before
signing
a
statement
had
communicated
with
the
international.
so
we
have
reason
to
believe
the
international
knew
the
full
facts
and
not
nearly
the
allegation
about
nine
illegal
votes
within
10
days
after
the
secretary
had
notice.
but
in
any
event
the
next
month
the
secretary
formally
wrote
to
union
advising
them
precisely
as
to
what
irregularities
his
investigation
had
turned
out
and
these
included
illegal
votes
at
both
elections,
illegal
candidates
at
both
elections.
and
illegal
votes
i
should
add
sufficient
in
number
to
affect
the
outcome,
not
nine,
but
some
50
or
60
which
would
or
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
runoff
election
for
business
representative.
now
there
was
a
--
in
answer
to
this
communication
from
the
secretary
the
union
took
the
adamant
position
that
it
would
not
investigate,
discuss,
talk
about
anything
except
the
charges
made
with
respect
to
the
runoff.
nobody
talk
about
the
charges
made
with
respect
to
the
runoff
expect
as
it
affected
illegal
votes,
it
would
say
nothing
about
illegal
candidates
because
that
was
all
that
had
been
included
in
the
member's
protest
when
it
was
made
to
the
union
in
another
time.
there
was
a
fruitless
conference
between
the
secretary
and
president
of
the
international
union
and
shortly
thereafter
the
secretary
filed
a
suit.
immediately,
well,
i
don't
know
how
soon
after
the
filing
of
the
suit,
the
union
moved
to
dismiss
those
portions
of
the
suit
which
had
anything
except
the
runoff
in
july
of
1963
on
the
ground
that
as
to
the
general
election
there
had
been
no
internal
protest
and
no
exhaustion
of
internal
remedies
and
therefore
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
look
into
that
earlier
general
election.
although
of
course
the
earlier
general
election
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
runoff
the
time
of
which
it
produced
the
runoff.
that
motion
to
dismiss
this
part
of
the
complaint
was
sustained
by
the
district
judge
on
the
grounds
i've
indicated.
at
this
point,
the
secretary
on
the
basis
of
admissions
and
answers
to
interrogatories
moved
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
runoff
asking
that
the
court
direct
at
least
a
rerun
of
that
runoff
election
for
the
office
of
business
representative
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
since
there
had
been
clear
violations
of
the
act
and
since
those
violations
has
obviously,
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
of
election.
the
district
judge
agreed
and
did
enter
that
order.
the
district
judge
noticed
that
there
were
58
illegal
ballots
cast
in
this
runoff
which
might
well
have
affected
the
outcome
and
that
it
said
was
reason
enough
to
require
a
rerun
of
that
particular
election.
the
district
judge
also
addressed
himself
to
the
question
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
with
respect
to
illegal
candidates
running,
but
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
that
question
and
expressed
some
doubt
whether
that
was
before
it
since
that
complaint
had
not
been
made
internally
through
the
union.
by
this
time
although
the
suit
was
filed
in
early
1964
where
in
april
of
1966
the
--
in
this
union
elections
every
three
years
as
opposed
to
two
years
as
in
the
prior
case
and
the
june
1966
regular
elections
were
impending
when
the
district
judge
issued
his
order.
so
he
provided
that
at
those
regular
elections
the
secretary
would
supervise
that
aspect
of
the
election
that
went
to
the
office
of
business
representative
but
not
the
rest
of
the
election
for
the
remaining
offices
and
that
those
elected
then
would
hold
office
for
the
following
three
years.
this
is
an
effort
common
in
the
district
courts
to
avoid
an
unnecessary
disruption
of
the
local
union's
regular
schedules
of
elections
rather
than
have
a
man
elected
for
two
or
three
months
and
then
have
to
rerun
the
election
again,
the
judge
made
this
sensible
accommodation
with
the
no
objection
from
the
secretary.
in
june
1966,
the
regular
elections
were
held,
the
secretary
did
supervise
that
portion
of
it,
which
related
to
business
representative
although
not
the
other
portion.
an
appeal
had
been
filed
by
him
to
the
sixth
circuit,
but
a
day
or
so
thereafter
these
intervening
elections
occurred
and
sixth
circuit
following
the
second
and
in
accord
with
the
third
circuit
of
the
prior
case
dismissed
the
secretary's
suit
or
ordered
it
dismissed
as
mooted
by
this
supervening
election.
accordingly,
it
reached
no
other
issue
of
the
case.
now
here
of
course
as
in
the
prior
case,
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
supervening
election
mooted
the
secretary's
request
for
an
order
directing
laboratory
election
or
a
supervised
election.
i
see
no
occasion
to
repeat
what
i
said
in
the
prior
case
on
that
score.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reasons
there
apply
fully
here
and
that
is
true
although
here
we
don't
know
whether
in
fact
there
were
any
irregularities
in
june
1966
when
the
supervening
election
occurred.
but
if
the
remedy
of
laboratory
election
is
ever
important
if
it
ever
serves
any
purpose
that
purpose,
you
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
holding
of
an
unsupervised
election.
by
definition
an
unsupervised
election
will
not
do
service
for
a
supervised
elections.
there
must
be
some
point
in
having
an
laboratory
election
and
that
point
cannot
be
defeated,
that
purpose
cannot
be
frustrated
by
the
accident
that
an
unsupervised
election
has
occurred
in
the
interim.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
wouldn't
claim
that
we
did.
we
could
take
any
action
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
assert
that
there--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
reason
no
known
irregularity,
we
simply
do
not
know
whether
or
not
this
practice
had
been
eliminated
by
the
time
this
election
was
run.
we
do
know
of
course
that
it
did
not
prevail
any
part
of
the
election
that
was
for
the
business
representative
because
we
supervised
that.
it
is
said
that
while
we
supervised
that
we
in
fact
oversaw
the
whole
election
and
ought
to
be
in
a
position
to
know.
that
comes
rather
strangely
from
the
union,
which
so
strongly
resisted
our
supervising
the
entire
election.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
we
ought
to
draw
any
inference
from
that,
there
was
something
to
hide.
i
am
saying
that
there
must
be
a
difference
between
what
we
were
allowed
to
do
and
what
we
wanted
to
do
or
there
wouldn't
have
been
all
this
fight
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so,
yes
mr.
justice
white
and
i,
as
i
say
separate
questions
from
the
bench
i
have
no
intention
to
re-argue
about
question
of
mootness
this
in
this
case
which
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
precisely
the
same
question
as
was
presented
in
the
other
case.
it
is
a
question,
which
must
be
decided
favorably
to
us
for
us
to
--
for
the
court
to
reach
any
other
question
in
the
case.
now
the
other
question,
which
justifies
my
somewhat
long
winded
statement
of
facts
is
what
we
call
a
scope
of
complaint
issue.
again
the
scope
of
complaint
issue,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
secretary
is
restricted
when
he
files
his
suit
to
those
matters,
which
have
been
complained
about
by
the
union
member
when
he
filed
his
protest
in
the
union
or
whether
having
investigated
at
the
instance
of
a
union
member
and
having
discovered
additional
violation
of
the
act,
he
is
free,
as
would
be
true
in
the
labor
board
area
to
complaint
in
his
court
suit
on
those
additional
violations
as
well.
we
just
take
the
position
that
the
secretary
is
not
bound
to
restrict
his
suit
to
those
grounds
of
complaint,
which
have
been
articulated
by
the
member
when
he
complained
internally
to
the
union.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
that
particular
election,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
and
it
serves
as
a
trigger
and
it
serves
an
important
function.
the
reason
why
under
the
labor
act
as
well
as
under
this
act
of
proceedings
can
only
begin
upon
the
complaint
of
a
union
member
or
a
charging
party
in
this
case
the
labor
board,
is
to
assure
that
the
government
will
not
unnecessarily
intrude
into
irregularities,
which
are
at
so
little
moment
that
not
a
single
member
is
ready
to
complaint
about
it.
but
once
that
requirement
is
satisfied,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
the
labor
board
area,
then
the
general
counsel
or
the
board
is
free
to
investigate
all
of
the
related
charges
whether
or
not
they
have
been
pinpointed
by
the
charging
party
in
his
complaint
to
the
general
counsel
and
we
would
urge
the
same
rule
here.
now
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
under
the
labor
board
practice
there
is
no
requirement
of
exhausting
internal
remedies
whereas
here
concededly
such
a
requirement
does
exist.
but
that
requirement
everybody
seems
to
agree
is
meant
to
serve
for
one
purpose
and
really
one
purpose
only,
that
is
to
afford
the
union
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
violation
to
clean
its
own
house
without
suffering
needles
governmental
interference.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
commit
the
secretary
to
go
beyond
the
complaint
filed
with
him
and
still
be
faithful
to
that
purpose
of
allowing
the
union
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
violation,
which
is
charged.
that's
obviously
true
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
union
member
says,
not
any
legal
votes
were
cast
in
the
runoff
and
he's
turned
down
because
that's
not
enough.
obviously
the
allegation
that
nine
illegal
votes
were
cast
alerts
the
union
that
it
may
have
been
50
and
not
nine.
even
the
district
judge
agreed
with
this
on
that
point.
but
the
allegation
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
suggested
distinction
between
the
case
in
which
the
violation
has
recurred
in
the
supervening
election.
in
this
case
all
we
know
it
did
not
recur.
the
suggestion
being
that
in
this
case,
secretary's
suit
is
mooted
because
there
has
intervened
a
clean
action
or
as
perhaps
in
the
previous
case
as
mr.
justice
fortas
put
it
the
gravamen
of
the
offense,
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
remains
because
the
taint
continued
through
the
second
election.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction
between
an
apparently
clean
supervening
election
and
equally
tainted
supervening
election,
although
appealing
at
first
is
both
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme
and
an
unworkable
basis
of
the
distinction.
as
to
the
statutory
scheme,
the
statute
might
have
provided
that
where
there
is
an
invalid
election
and
the
court
so
finds
then
the
court
shall
order
that
the
election
be
rerun
free
of
the
taint,
it
might
have
left
at
that.
it
did
not,
congress
did
not
choose
that
remedy
instead
of
which
it
said
the
election
shall
be
rerun
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary.
that
was
presumably
to
assure
not
only
that
this
particular
violation
would
be
eliminated
in
the
rerun,
but
that
other
violations,
new
violations
would
be
eliminated
if
they
were
to
reintroduced
at
this
rerun
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
insofar
as
the
complaint
read
it
was
limited
to
the
business
representative
election
that
has
been
corrected.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
the
limited
scope
of
the
original
protest,
we
argue
of
course
that,
that
protest
goes
not
only
to
the
rerun,
but
to
the
general
election
held
a
month
early
or
must
reasonably
be
viewed
as
going
to.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
assuming,
as
i
must
to
answer
your
question
that
secretary
may
look
beyond
the
narrow
protest,
which
was
filed
internally
with
the
union
and
that
broader
complaint
is
sustained
for
that
purpose,
here
there
must
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court,
assuming
it
is
staying
that
is
the
june
1963
general
election
is
tainted
and
invalid.
there
is
no
need
for
an
order
setting
it
aside
since
it
has
been
superseded.
there
remains
a
need
for
a
new
election,
a
supervised
election
to
remove
the
taint,
which
it
seems
to
us
must
be
assumed
to
still
subsist.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
the
problem
of
the
term
of
office
is
the
same
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
intervening
election
whether
we
are
dealing
with
an
original
election.
if
the
new
election
ordered
by
the
court
is
at
the
very
end
of
the
term
of
prior
election
the
courts
will
as
a
matter
of
accommodation
either
hold
the
election
then
and
make
the
term
three
years
and
two
months
or
will
wait
as
in
this
case
and
simply
delay
the
laboratory
election
until
the
regularly
scheduled
one
under
the
union's
counsel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
that
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
possible,
of
course
that
is
true
in
this
case
only
because
it
has
come
to
this
court
that
would
not
be
the
normal
situation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
are
in
no
position
to
make
that
decision
nor
we
can
say
the
contrary.
we
simply
don't
know
and
that's
the
problem
in
these
cases.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
did
not
supervise
it,
we
simply
don't
know.
now
if
it
was
in
fact
clean
and
whenever
the
election
attacked
is
about
to
be
overtaken,
the
union
has
a
very
simple
remedy
if
it's
going
to
run
a
clean
election
and
want
to
move
up
the
case.
it
is
free
to
really
move
the
case
by
agreeing
to
supervision.
it
tells
this
under
601
we
can
investigate
that
election
and
oversee
it
and
then
there
are
some
suggestion
that
oversight
is
really
the
same
supervision
that
supervise
it,
it
will
happy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
say
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
the
secretary
is
still
entitled
to
insist
on
an
laboratory
election
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
union
had
refused
to
voluntarily
withdraw
this
bylaw
before
the
next
election
had
occurred
or
before
the
secretary
had
filed
the
complaint
which
it
was
free
to
do,
it
doesn't
follow
that
secretary
will
insist
on
asserting
his
right.
the
secretary
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
us
comparable
to
the
law
of
injunction,
which
commits
an
injunction
to
be
issued
although
there
has
been
compliance
in
the
interim.
the
purpose
of
the
injunction
being
to
assure
that
it
will
not
occur
in
future.
now
in
the
case
put
by
justice
white
yesterday
where
the
violation
was
technical
of
isolated
nature,
not
likely
to
recur,
the
great
probabilities
are
that
if
that
particular
violation
is
eliminated
and
the
secretary
is
satisfied
that
the
intervening
election
is
in
all
other
respects
clean,
he
will
voluntarily
dismiss
his
complaint
and
not
insist
on
a
disrupt
--
a
new
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
say
the
case
has
not
moot
primarily
because
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
second
election
was
holy
clean,
you
really
need
a
new
trial
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
new
trial
before
the
district
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
secretary
is
satisfied
and
voluntarily
dismisses
the
suit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
duty
is
other
way.
the
duty
is
on
the
union
to
demonstrate
that
the
intervening
election
which
it
refused
to
allow
the
secretary
to
supervise,
is
in
fact
clean.
however,
there
maybe
instances
where
the
secretary
is
abusing
his
discretion
in
failing
to
dismiss
a
case.
in
that
instance
perhaps
the
district
court
as
it
would
in
an
injunction
case
not
because
of
mootness
but
because
of
want
of
equity
would
deny
relief
to
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
the
court
is
not
concerned
with
trifles,
will
not
grant
harsh
relief
when
the
violation
is
de
minimus
or
where
the
indication
of
any
recurrence
of
the
violation
are
insufficient.
we
do
concede
in
the
district
court
that
power,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
normal
remedy
is
laboratory
election.
that
is
the
remedy
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
except
where
the
secretary
waives
it
or
where
the
court
feels
it's
too
harsh
under
the
circumstances
it
ought
to
be
followed.
