how

justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me
for
interrupting

going
back
to
601,
what
is
the
secretary's
remedy
other
than
disclosure?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
it,
and
i'm
asking
what
is
his
remedy
in
addition
to
disclosure?
justice
abe
fortas
dose
he
have
any
court
remedy?
justice
abe
fortas
dose
he
have
any
judicial
remedy?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
contend
that
the
1966
election
is
characterized
by
the
same
fault
that
is
found
in
1963
election?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
your
adversary
said
that
perhaps
a
bit
optimistic
whether
mr.
claiborne
would
conceive
that
1966
election
was
without
fault,
we
both
accept
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
put
a
hypothetical
case
to
you?
let
us
suppose
that
the
only
fault
that
the
secretary
had
found
in
1963
election
was
a
presence
of
a
certain
bylaw
and
let
us
suppose
that
thereafter
that
particular
bylaw
by
former
union
action
turned
out
in
good
faith
had
been
eliminated.
would
you
still
say
that
that
case
was
not
moot
and
that
the
secretary
was
empowered
to
an
order
requiring
supervise
the
election?
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
suppose
he
does
and
your
adversary
correctly
says
that
that's
what's
happened
here
by
following.
but
what
you
are
really
saying
then
is
that
the
truth
of
essence
results
in
sort
of
--
results
in
creating
a
condition
which
can
cured
only
by
if
it
was
an
election
and
you
construe
the
statute
then
as
prescribed
remedy
for
that
sort
of
sin,
let
me
put
in
that
perhaps
some
fair
way.
