justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
the
result
if
we
agreed
with
the
secretary?
we
can't
quite
turn
the
clock
back
to
1963.
there
has
been
another
election
in
1966
in
terms
of
those
people
who
are
drawing
to
a
close
or
at
least
beginning
to,
are
they
3-year
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
and
601
as
you
said,
as
i
understood
it
in
answer
to
the
question
of
my
brother
fortas
is,
while
it's
broad--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
very
broad,
but
at
the
same
time
very
--
it's
limited
because
it
gives
no
remedy.
it
gives
the
secretary
no
power
beyond
merely
to
investigate,
even
publicity
powers,
is
that
true?
601
doesn't
give
him
any
power
to
conduct
a
laboratory
election
or
to
set
aside
an
election
or
to
do
anything
else.
there
is
no
remedy
at
all
there
expect
publicity,
investigation
and
publicity
in
601?
justice
potter
stewart
that
tends
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
claiborne
i
think
i
have
a
little
difficulty
with
the
mechanics
of
what
would
happen
in
the
event
that
the
court
shall
decide
that
your
position
is
correct.
what
was
complained
of
here
by
union
member
and
the
only
thing
it
was
complaint
of
a
union
member
was
something
to
do
with
an
election
back
in
1963
and
that's
a
runoff
election,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
1963
that
particular,
it
might
have
been
take
care
of
because
there
was
laboratory
election
of
the
business
agent
election
and
other
than
--
for
the
1963
term
and
which
the
complainant
lost,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
been
a
long
history
now.
then
there
was
another
election
in
1966
of
which
no
union
member
complained,
which
you
say
should
have
been
conducted
by
the
secretary
under
these
laboratory
conditions
but
it
wasn't
and
that
too
is
now
history.
and
let's
say
that
we
should
decide
that
your
basic
position
is
right,
but
what
happened,
we're
now
in
1967,
we're
running
close
to
1968,
it
will
happen
and
what
were
terms
of
--
when
would
the
elections
be
held,
what
will
the
terms
of
officers
be.
this
all
began
with
a
rather
narrow
complaint
by
one
individual
as
to
runoff
election
back
in
1963,
i'm
just
having
a
little
difficulty
maybe
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
exactly
the
actual
protest
was
as
to
a
specific
runoff
election
of
business
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
position
that
it
triggers
that
any
such
thing
triggers
a
much
broader
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
new
election
--
there
was
a
new
election
in
1966
and
that
too
is
history?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
might
work
out
in
this
case
with
the
natural
delay
plus
the
kind
of
accommodation
by
the
court
which
you
are
talking
about,
if
you
won't
get
your
actual
laboratory
election
if
you
call
it
until
1969,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
well
realm
probably?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
the
result
if
we
agreed
with
the
secretary?
we
can't
quite
turn
the
clock
back
to
1963.
there

or
to
