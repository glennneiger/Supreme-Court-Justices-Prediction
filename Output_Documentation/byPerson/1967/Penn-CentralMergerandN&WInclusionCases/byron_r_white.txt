justice

r.
white
mr.
trienens,
does
the
commission
have
the
power
to
order
the
inclusion
of
the
three
roads
in
a
--
in
another
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
determining
the
faith
of
the
three
roads,
if
it
was
determined
that
if
boston
and
maine
for
example
is
determined
that's
its
going
to
do
it
alone,
(inaudible)
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
either
system
to
have
its
state
determine,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
these
three
roads
have
an
opportunity
to
be
in
another
system
and
they
have
this
on
the
terms
that
are
argued
to
be
or
found
to
be
equitable
and
fair.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
do
you
think
the
courts'
mandate
then
--
if
the
--
that
the
--
that
it
must
be
finally
decided
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
two
roads
rather
than
it
should
be
just
firmly
decided
on
how
these
roads
are
going
to
be
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
you
objected
to
the
merger
at
all
if
the
commission
had
found
that
the
three
roads
should
go
into
penn-central,
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
one
road
has
already
accepted,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
agreed
in
advance
to
do
that,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
benefit
will
approve
of
the
erie
from
being
taken
over
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
while
operating
economies
would
have
(inaudible)
as
a
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
icc
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
become
a
party
in
the
new
york
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
were
a
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
weren't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
obliged
to
raise
all
the
questions
about
the
merger,
you
had
to
raised
in
the
--
in
order
of
the
three-judge-court
of
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don't
--
it's
about
the
consolidation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
its
about
you,
you
as
a
party,
were
you
required
if
you
were
going
to
attack
the
order
of
new
york
court
which
you
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
required
to
raise
all
your
grounds
if
you
attack
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that,
but
you
remained
a
party
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
refused
to
let
you
withdraw?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
it
was
an
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
were
required
to
submit
what
ground
you
had
to
attack
the
merger
in
the
new
york
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
you
required
--
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
schedule
was
a
reasonable
one.
were
you
required
to
follow
it?
i
mean,
isn't
it
proper
to
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
to,
do
you
think
you're
entitled
to
present
some
grounds
to
attack
the
merger
in
new
york
in
some
other
grounds
and
some
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
requirements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
--
there
weren't
new
complaints
filed
after
the
second
icc
order
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
new
cases?
new
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
new
complaints
for
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
supplemental.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
commission
examine
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
perhaps
you
could
clear
me
up
whether
the
commission
ever
find
that
the
merger
of
penn-central,
penn
and
the
central
would
be
in
the
public
interest
if
the
three
railroads
became
part
of
that
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
one
of
the
possibilities,
if
these
railroads
don't
accept
the
present
results
of
the
inclusion
case
and
the
other
possibility
is
going
into
penn-central,
how
can
the
commission
not
have
--
if
it
wants
the
merger
to
go
forward,
how
can
it
say
that
it
has
not
found
that
inclusion
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest,
penn-central,
because
we
have
to
--
how
can
the
merger
go
forward
if
it's
necessary
to
find
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
include
the
three
--
these
three
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can
take
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
it
this
then
though
--
why
is
--
if
the
commission
wants
the
penn-central
merger
to
go
forward,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
almost
found
that
if
it
hasn't
expressly
and
had
--
for
all
practical
purposes
found
that
inclusion
of
these
three
roads
in
penn-central
would
not
be
able
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
say
that
as
long
as
there
is
an
open
--
that
there
is
an
open
alternative
for
these
three
roads,
namely
to
go
in
to
the
penn-central
system
that
the
penn-central
merger
should
not
go
forward?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
because
you've
already
indicated
that
you
would
say
that
the
public
interest
would
require
that
the
merger
not
go
forward
if
these
three
roads
were
involved
because
there
would
be
monopoly
conditions
in
new
england.
now,
certainly
the
commission
has
never
found
yet
that
creating
that
kind
of
a
situation
would
be
in
the
public
interest
enough
to
permit
the
penn
and
central
to
merge
on
--
in
that
condition.
it
never
count
that
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
stock
that
the
commission
thought
there
were
--
that
the
mortgage
had
(inaudible)
--
the
mortgage
deed
had
ample
value,
underlying
your
mortgage
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
general
mortgage
bonds
and
all
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
the
market
value
of
the
debt
only
half
of
its
face
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
poor
chances
of
being
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
required
with
the
public
interest
to
make
it
--
exist
independently
in
placing
their
merge
to
penn-central.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
the
court
last
term,
based
on
its
understanding
that
the
roads
were
essential
to
public
interest
and
that
the
--
if
they
couldn't
survive
alone,
didn't
the
court
say
to
them,
the
merger
shouldn't
go
forward
to
--
at
the
expense
of
those
roads?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
have
the
right
to
stay
independent.
justice
byron
r.
white
penn-central
--
justice
byron
r.
white
penn-central,
by
merging
can
force
them
to
merge
with
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
private
--
public
interest
(inaudible)
use
the
private
reserves.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
result
is
though
that
the
roads
have
no
right
to
stay
as
independent
entities
if
the
--
if
they
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
going
--
it
would
be
public
interest
of
the
merger,
the
merger
overrides
their
rights
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
really
a
forced
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
do
you
mean
that
a
reasonable
minded
businessman
in
one
of
the
three
roads
shouldn't
really
anticipate
that
he
has
much
of
a
chance
of
getting
in
the
--
getting
into
penn-central.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
reads
the
commission
orders
and
pays
full
attention
that
the
--
his
options
have
been
considerably
reduced
by
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
make
a
reasonable
argument
that
the
--
that
it
would
--
that
if
one
of
the
options
that
was
opened
for
these
roads
was
still
the
--
to
turn
it
--
turns
--
turned
down
these
proposition
and
to
go
with
the
penn-central,
then
the
commission
could
not
have
approved
the
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger
without
violating
the
mandate
of
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
provision
of
the
inclusion
order.
it's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
d

h.
justice

mr.

does
the
