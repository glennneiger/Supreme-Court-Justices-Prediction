chief

mr.
trienens,
may
i
ask
this.
are
we
to
be
influenced
by
every
time
a
stockholder,
even
if
he
is
a
principal
stockholder,
changes
his
mind
about
whether
this
is
a
good
project
or
not
when
the
board
of
directors
which
he
is
a

has
voted
to
take
a
certain
action
and
the

has
had
to

i
beg
your

yes
--
chief

--
but
is
done
so
after

--
once
approved
it
--
chief

--
and
the

acted
upon
it.
are
we
to
be
governed

that?
chief

earl

well,
what
--
my
only
point
was,
are
we
to
be
influenced
in
anyway
by
what
stockholders
think
now
but
what
is
not
in
the

so,
if
we
do,
why
--
we
--
i
suppose
we
(inaudible)
--
chief

have
any
finality

any
purpose
in
the
placing
of

so,
does
it
occur
to
you
that
if
there
are
any
--
on
any
of
these
issues
that
the

should
retain
some
jurisdiction
other
than
it
has
for

of
