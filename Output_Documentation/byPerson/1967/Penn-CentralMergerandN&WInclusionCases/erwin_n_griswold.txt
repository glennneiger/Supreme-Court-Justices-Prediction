mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
of
course
in
effect
although
there
are
nine
separate
numbers
here
and
a
great
mass
of
papers,
there
are
essentially
two
problems
with
various
ramifications
which
come
from
those
problem.
one
is
the
merger
of
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
railroads
and
there
is
no
one
here
who
is
in
substance
opposing
that
merger
except
the
--
you've
heard
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
--
mr.
shapp
who
appears
in
the
same
case.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
would
suppose
--
mr.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
they
should
have
appeared
in
the
new
york
city
--
in
the
three-judge
district
court
in
new
york
and
that
they
are
properly
foreclosed
for
not
having.
mr.
griswold
yes,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
new
york
operates
its
res
judicata
to
determine
their
interest
in
that
case.
then
we
also
have
the
inclusion
case
on
which
has
a
long
background
but
which
is
the
direct
consequence
in
its
present
posture
of
this
court's
decision
earlier
this
year
in
the
earlier
--
in
the
previous
term.
before
discussing
the
inclusion
case,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
this
proceeding
perhaps
has
its
roots
47
years
ago
in
the
transportation
act
1920
when
congress
laid
down
the
policy
that
there
should
be
mergers
and
consolidations
of
railroads.
a
matter
with
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
struggled
for
a
great
many
years
and
as
far
as
the
east
is
concerned,
developments
have
happened
only
very
recently.
and
with
respect
to
the
penn-central
merger
itself,
i
don't
know
when
negotiations
for
that
began,
but
the
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
seeking
approval
of
an
arrangement
which
had
previously
been
worked
out,
it
was
filed
on
march
9,
1962
which
is
five
years
and
nine
months
ago.
and
in
the
interval,
an
enormous
amount
of
effort,
the
time
and
thought
of
many
people
are
representing
the
private
interest
concerned
representing
the
public
through
states
and
cities
and
shippers,
and
the
staff
and
the
members
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
been
working
on
this.
mr.
griswold
it's
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
oppose
the
merger
but
they
do
oppose
the
inclusion
terms.
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
i'm
sure
that
some
of
the
subsequent
counsel
here
will
correct
me.
mr.
griswold
they
maintain
--
mr.
griswold
--
this
unless
there
are
--
unless
they
--
unless
the
rights
which
they
claim
with
respect
to
inclusion
are
upheld,
that
then
the
merger
should
not
go
ahead.
but
if
i
can
put
it
this
way,
if
we
look
just
at
the
merger
alone,
there
is
no
one
who
says
that
the
merger
should
not
be
made
except
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
gentleman
who
is
associated
in
that
case.
mr.
griswold
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
griswold
that
the
position
of
the
norfolk
and
western
is
--
that
the
existing
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
present
circumstances
does
not
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court's
decision
of
last
term,
which
if
it
is
taken
one
phrase
and
the
opinion
is
taken
literally,
that
there
must
be
found
a
haven
for
these
roads
that
that
has
not
been
done.
and
that
therefore
the
merger
should
not
be
carried
out
until
that
has
been
done.
i
think
that
illustrates
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
i'm
rather
a
new
comer
to
this
matter.
and
as
i
have
thought
about
it,
i
couldn't
help
thinking
of
the
old
mexican
shell
game
where
you
put
a
pea
here
and
then
try
to
cover
it
and
then
you
move
over
here
and
try
to
find
it
there
and
everything
--
it's
very
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
what
there
is.
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
situation
with
respect
to
valuation
has
entirely
changed
from
what
it
was
when
the
commission
made
its
original
order
in
this
matter.
and
of
course
it
has
and
it
will
always
be
that
way
whenever
the
commission
makes
a
decision
with
respect
to
valuation
by
the
time
it
gets
before
this
court
for
review,
a
considerable
amount
of
time
will
have
expired
and
the
situation
will
be
different.
if
that
one
is
the
controlling
factor,
it
would
never
be
possible
to
carry
out
a
merger
such
as
congress
long
ago
contemplated.
and
then
we
find
that
the
situation
is
very
difficult
because
there
are
constant
changes
even
by
letter
received
by
this
court
last
thursday
or
friday
with
respect
to
the
attitudes
of
the
parties
as
to
whether
they
will
or
will
not
accept
the
terms
of
inclusion.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
or
let
me
put
it
in
another
way,
i
have
the
fortunate
opportunity
here
of
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
public
interest.
there
are
numerous
private
interests
involved
here
which
are
of
course
important
and
which
are
--
will
be
fully
presented
to
the
court.
but
the
public
interest
here
is
to
provide
the
country
with
adequate
and
proper
railroad
transportation
on
fair
terms
to
shippers
as
well
as
to
the
investors
in
the
railroad
companies.
the
function
of
the
court
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
is
not
to
administer
the
transportation
act,
that
is
the
function
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort,
skill,
experience
on
this
matter.
and
the
function
of
the
court
is
not
to
decide
itself
to
the
matter,
but
to
determine
whether
the
commission
has
acted
in
accordance
with
the
proper
procedures
has
reached
results
which
are
not
arbitrary
and
no
one
can
tell
whether
the
commission
has
reached
the
precisely
correct
results.
this
is
not
an
area
in
which
there
is
a
precise
truth
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
here
that
the
commission
has
acted
intelligently
and
fairly,
not
only
in
formulating
the
terms
of
the
merger
and
of
the
inclusion
but
in
seeking
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
the
last
term.
when
this
case
was
here
before,
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took
different
positions.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
urged
the
immediate
affirmance
of
the
merger
order.
the
united
states
took
the
position
which
the
court
upheld
that
the
merger
should
not
go
forward
until
further
steps
were
taken
with
respect
to
the
three
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna,
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
boston
&
maine.
now
it
is
suggested
that
that
aspect
of
the
order
has
not
been
carried
out
because
we
do
not
have
to
present
to
this
court
a
need
--
package
in
which
the
boston
&
maine,
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
erie-lackawanna
are
now
a
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
system.
of
course
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
argument
earlier
today,
the
commission
has
no
power
to
require
these
roads
to
accept
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
&
western
system.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
fix
fair
and
equitable
terms
for
their
inclusion
and
they
are
free
to
accept
them
or
not.
and
this
is
one
of
the
places
where
the
difference
between
the
public
interest
and
the
private
interest
perhaps
most
clearly
appears.
the
situation
in
our
law
is
that
matters
of
this
sort
can
depend
a
good
deal
upon
the
action
of
the
stockholders
of
these
companies.
and
we
tend
to
think
when
we
look
at
things
superficially
that
of
course
the
stockholders
will
represent
all
interest.
that
becomes
difficult
to
uphold
when
we
think
in
terms
of
the
stockholders,
let
us
say
of
the
new
haven
railroad
who
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
have
any
remaining
interest
in
that
property
at
all
and
yet
it
may
well
be
that
unless
some
new
law
is
made
that
they
may
be
called
upon
to
approve
steps
which
are
taken
with
respect
to
the
new
haven
railroad.
now
with
respect
to
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
boston
&
maine,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
stockholders
had
been
put
in
a
place
where
they
can
negotiate,
bargain,
hold
up,
offer,
try
to
get
a
better
deal
and
it
is
to
their
interest
to
refrain
from
accepting
the
inclusion
terms
as
long
as
they
can
if
there
remains
any
conceivable
prospect
that
in
anyway
from
any
other
source,
they
might
get
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
which
would
be
more
attractive
to
them.
the
stockholders
in
this
situation
with
respect
to
both
of
these
companies,
delaware
&
hudson
and
boston
&
maine
obviously
had
been
put
in
a
position
where
they
have
simply
a
hold
up
value.
they
are
--
the
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
a
matter
of
very
great
importance
which
there
is
much
public
interest
and
which
there
is
great
private
interest.
they
sit
back
and
say,
“well,
we
haven't
made
up
our
minds.
we
don't
know
what
we're
going
to
do”.
there
is
great
concern
about
moving
the
merger
ahead
promptly
not
merely
because
of
the
private
interest
concerned
but
especially
because
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
new
haven
railroad
and
its
effect
on
transportation
to
the
whole
new
england
area.
now
when
one
looks
at
it
simply
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
is
the
way
that
i
can
get
the
most
out
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
reasonably
obvious
that
you
sit
back
and
wait
and
try
to
see
if
you
can't
get
any
better
offer
from
someone
in
the
situation
where
there
is
understood
to
be
no
power
to
require
the
inclusion
of
these
roads.
not
only
is
there
this
hold
up
value
in
the
situation
but
there
is
also
what
i
would
call
the
playoff
value.
that
you
not
only
have
the
right
to
hold
up
on
accepting
going
in
to
norfolk
&
western
with
the
great
leverage
from
the
fact
that
because
you're
hold
up,
you
tie
up
the
whole
merger
and
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
with
the
new
haven
and
all
the
other
things.
but
you
also
have
the
chance
to
try
to
stir
up
interest
with
respect
to
other
possible
customers
which
might
be
the
penn-central.
it
might
be
some
other
merger
which
could
be
worked
out
over
a
course
of
a
great
deal
of
time.
it
might
conceivably
be
some
sort
of
a
new
england
railroad,
the
viability
of
which
i
find
hard
to
be
sure
of.
the
norfolk
&
western
here
makes
a
great
deal
of
the
appendix
g
conditions
and
i
must
confess
that
i
find
some
sympathy
with
that
point
of
view
as
far
as
the
time
duration
of
those
conditions
are
involved.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
possible
to
bring
this
matter
to
a
conclusion
which
is
obviously
in
the
public
interest
if
some
formulation
were
found
which
would
require
the
boston
&
maine
and
the
delaware
&
hudson
either
to
accept
the
inclusion
conditions
or
to
know
that
they
would
have
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
which
is
a
very
hard
thing
for
them
to
do.
the
appendix
g
conditions
are
stated
in
--
that
is
the
duration,
the
term
of
them
are
stated
in
full
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
report.
it
seems
to
me
that
considering
how
these
matters
often
go
that
they
provide
a
period
which
might
extend
as
long
as
four
years
within
which
these
two
roads
could
continue
to
negotiate
and
seek
to
find
a
better
offer.
if
that
was
reduced
to
a
fixed,
flat
period,
six
months,
three
months,
it
might
be
possible
to
find
out
what
is
going
to
happen
here
and
have
something
more
fixed
and
specific
with
which
to
deal.
norfolk
&
western
complains
because
it
says
that,
as
it
now
stands,
it
is
going
to
be
required
to
take
the
erie-lackawanna
and
doesn't
know
whether
it
will
get
the
boston
&
maine
and
the
delaware
&
hudson.
it
points
out
that
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
below
and
incidentally
i
think
it's
not
inappropriate
to
say
that
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
remarkable
opinion
and
as
i
have
worked
on
this
case,
i've
constantly
found
myself
coming
back
to
it
and
finding
there
--
well,
set
out
the
answers
to
the
questions
which
were
published
--
puzzling
me.
norfolk
&
western
points
out
that
judge
friendly
said
on
page
61
of
his
opinion
that
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
the
erie-lackawanna's
penn-central
losses
in
the
event
that
the
delaware
&
hudson
was
not
included
and
that
is
true
but
that
is
really
an
alternative
ground
of
his
decision.
earlier
in
that
opinion,
two
or
three
pages
earlier,
judge
friendly
had
pointed
out
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue
was
with
respect
to
--
was
on
the
norfolk
&
western.
norfolk
&
western
was
in
no
sense
taken
by
surprise.
there
was
never
a
joint
petition
for
inclusion,
never
a
petition
that
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
&
hudson
and
boston
&
maine
should
be
included.
there
were
always
separate
petitions
for
inclusion
filed
by
each
road
and
as
judge
friendly
points
out
the
norfolk
&
western
was
the
custodian
of
the
figures
and
knowledge
and
it
had
the
burden
of
presenting
evidence
that
--
but
permitted
judgment
of
the
degree
to
which
the
petitioners
would
protect
this
traffic.
it
failed
to
do
that
even
on
the
assumption
that
all
three
were
included,
let
alone
on
less
probable
eventualities.
so
that
i
think
that
norfolk
&
western's
position
here
can
be
answered
on
the
ground
that
it
is
presented
rather
late
and
that
if
its
real
objection
is
that
it
ought
not
to
be
required
to
take
the
erie-lackawanna
alone,
it
should
have
presented
evidence
on
that
at
an
earlier
state
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
griswold
i'm
afraid
i
have
no
knowledge
about
that.
mr.
ginnane,
the
counsel
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
tells
me
there
has
been
no
such
finding.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
--
at
the
time
of
decision,
no
issue
before
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
of
these
three
lines
and
penn-central,
isn't
that
right
mr.
ginnane?
mr.
griswold
they
had
petitioned
for
inclusion
at
an
earlier
time
and
had
withdrawn
those
petitions
in
penn-central.
i
suppose
that
i
am
influenced
by
my
new
england
background
but
i
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
see
how
inclusion
of
these
three
roads
and
penn-central
could
conceivably
be
in
the
public
interest
because
it
would
mean
a
situation
of
complete
lack
of
competition
in
an
entire
area
of
the
country
and
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
has
so
found.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
actually
made
such
a
finding.
this
is
implicit
in
the
finding
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
for
them
to
be
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
merger.
i
suppose
that
what
the
commission
had
in
mind
was
that
you
can't
ever
foresee
what
things
will
be
in
the
future.
and
it
did
not
foreclose
for
all
time
completely
the
possibility
that
these
roads
might
become
a
part
of
penn-central.
mr.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
i
--
i
don't
think
i
--
mr.
griswold
then
i
would
be
greatly
surprised
if
they
would
find
it
here.
i'm
not
able
to
say
much
more
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
record
here
which
should
--
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
d.c.road
becoming
a
part
of
penn-central.
the
whole
underlying
basis
of
the
commission's
action
in
this
matter
in
providing
the
inclusion
order
shows
that
it
understood,
its
understanding
was
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
having
these
three
roads
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
system,
thus
providing
access
by
the
norfolk
&
western
from
buffalo
to
the
new
york
city
gateway
and
a
competition
among
railroads
in
new
england.
mr.
griswold
i
think
we're
in
--
mr.
griswold
i
think
we're
entirely
--
mr.
griswold
--
together.
mr.
griswold
yes,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
commission
has
done
that.
but
the
commission
has
no
power
to
require
them
to
accept
it.
mr.
griswold
and
that
is
our
--
mr.
griswold
--
precisely
our
position
and
it
is
the
reason
why
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
griswold
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
i
don't
think
we
have
taken
any
position
that
it
shouldn't
be
remanded
to
the
commission
to
give
oversight
as
to
how
it
is
carried
out
and
to
deal
with
matters
of
detail
in
the
process
of
carrying
out
the
merger.
mr.
griswold
i
don't
know
of
any
such
issue.
mr.
fooshee
has
raised
the
question
with
respect
to
bondholders
of
the
erie-lackawanna
as
to
whether
they
might
have
their
security
drained
away
by
the
action
of
the
combined
management.
i
would
suppose
that
no
reservation
was
needed
even
to
protect
the
--
that
interest
because
the
courts
of
equity
will
remain
open
and
if
the
management
favors
one
group
of
creditors
over
another
creditor
in
an
equity
court
or
conceivably
through
proceedings
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
take
care
of
it,
whether
any
reservation
is
made
or
not.
mr.
griswold
i
believe
--
mr.
griswold
i
believe
it
did.
this
is
--
mr.
griswold
i
believe
there
is
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction.
that
of
course
would
be
to
act
within
whatever
scope
and
ambit
is
left
after
this
court's
mandate.
mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
of
course
in
effect
although
there
are
nine
separate
numbers
here
and
a
great
mass
of
papers,
there
are
essentially
two
problems
with
various
ramifications
which
come
from
those
problem.
one
is
the
merger
of
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
railroads
and
there
is
no
one
here
who
is
in
substance
opposing
that
merger
except
the
--
you've
heard
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
--
mr.
shapp
who
appears
in
the
same
case.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
would
suppose
--
mr.
griswold
i
would
suppose
that
they
should
have
appeared
in
the
new
york
city
--
in
the
three-judge
district
court
in
new
york
and
that
they
are
properly
foreclosed
for
not
having.
mr.
griswold
yes,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
new
york
operates
its
res
judicata
to
determine
their
interest
in
that
case.
then
we
also
have
the
inclusion
case
on
which
has
a
long
background
but
which
is
the
direct
consequence
in
its
present
posture
of
this
court's
decision
earlier
this
year
in
the
earlier
--
in
the
previous
term.
before
discussing
the
inclusion
case,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
this
proceeding
perhaps
has
its
roots
47
years
ago
in
the
transportation
act
1920
when
congress
laid
down
the
policy
that
there
should
be
mergers
and
consolidations
of
railroads.
a
matter
with
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
struggled
for
a
great
many
years
and
as
far
as
the
east
is
concerned,
developments
have
happened
only
very
recently.
and
with
respect
to
the
penn-central
merger
itself,
i
don't
know
when
negotiations
for
that
began,
but
the
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
seeking
approval
of
an
arrangement
which
had
previously
been
worked
out,
it
was
filed
on
march
9,
1962
which
is
five
years
and
nine
months
ago.
and
in
the
interval,
an
enormous
amount
of
effort,
the
time
and
thought
of
many
people
are
representing
the
private
interest
concerned
representing
the
public
through
states
and
cities
and
shippers,
and
the
staff
and
the
members
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
been
working
on
this.
mr.
griswold
it's
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
oppose
the
merger
but
they
do
oppose
the
inclusion
terms.
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
i'm
sure
that
some
of
the
subsequent
counsel
here
will
correct
me.
mr.
griswold
they
maintain
--
mr.
griswold
--
this
unless
there
are
--
unless
they
--
unless
the
rights
which
they
claim
with
respect
to
inclusion
are
upheld,
that
then
the
merger
should
not
go
ahead.
but
if
i
can
put
it
this
way,
if
we
look
just
at
the
merger
alone,
there
is
no
one
who
says
that
the
merger
should
not
be
made
except
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
gentleman
who
is
associated
in
that
case.
mr.
griswold
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
griswold
that
the
position
of
the
norfolk
and
western
is
--
that
the
existing
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
present
circumstances
does
not
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court's
decision
of
last
term,
which
if
it
is
taken
one
phrase
and
the
opinion
is
taken
literally,
that
there
must
be
found
a
haven
for
these
roads
that
that
has
not
been
done.
and
that
therefore
the
merger
should
not
be
carried
out
until
that
has
been
done.
i
think
that
illustrates
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
i'm
rather
a
new
comer
to
this
matter.
and
as
i
have
thought
about
it,
i
couldn't
help
thinking
of
the
old
mexican
shell
game
where
you
put
a
pea
here
and
then
try
to
cover
it
and
then
you
move
over
here
and
try
to
find
it
there
and
everything
--
it's
very
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
what
there
is.
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
situation
with
respect
to
valuation
has
entirely
changed
from
what
it
was
when
the
commission
made
its
original
order
in
this
matter.
and
of
course
it
has
and
it
will
always
be
that
way
whenever
the
commission
makes
a
decision
with
respect
to
valuation
by
the
time
it
gets
before
this
court
for
review,
a
considerable
amount
of
time
will
have
expired
and
the
situation
will
be
different.
if
that
one
is
the
controlling
factor,
it
would
never
be
possible
to
carry
out
a
merger
such
as
congress
long
ago
contemplated.
and
then
we
find
that
the
situation
is
very
difficult
because
there
are
constant
changes
even
by
letter
received
by
this
court
last
thursday
or
friday
with
respect
to
the
attitudes
of
the
parties
as
to
whether
they
will
or
will
not
accept
the
terms
of
inclusion.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
or
let
me
put
it
in
another
way,
i
have
the
fortunate
opportunity
here
of
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
public
interest.
there
are
numerous
private
interests
involved
here
which
are
of
course
important
and
which
are
--
will
be
fully
presented
to
the
court.
but
the
public
interest
here
is
to
provide
the
country
with
adequate
and
proper
railroad
transportation
on
fair
terms
to
shippers
as
well
as
to
the
investors
in
the
railroad
companies.
the
function
of
the
court
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
is
not
to
administer
the
transportation
act,
that
is
the
function
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort,
skill,
experience
on
this
matter.
and
the
function
of
the
court
is
not
to
decide
itself
to
the
matter,
but
to
determine
whether
the
commission
has
acted
in
accordance
with
the
proper
procedures
has
reached
results
which
are
not
arbitrary
and
no
one
can
tell
whether
the
commission
has
reached
the
precisely
correct
results.
this
is
not
an
area
in
which
there
is
a
precise
truth
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
here
that
the
commission
has
acted
intelligently
and
fairly,
not
only
in
formulating
the
terms
of
the
merger
and
of
the
inclusion
but
in
seeking
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
the
last
term.
when
this
case
was
here
before,
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took
different
positions.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
urged
the
immediate
affirmance
of
the
merger
order.
the
united
states
took
the
position
which
the
court
upheld
that
the
merger
should
not
go
forward
until
further
steps
were
taken
with
respect
to
the
three
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna,
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
boston
&
maine.
now
it
is
suggested
that
that
aspect
of
the
order
has
not
been
carried
out
because
we
do
not
have
to
present
to
this
court
a
need
--
package
in
which
the
boston
&
maine,
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
erie-lackawanna
are
now
a
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
system.
of
course
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
argument
earlier
today,
the
commission
has
no
power
to
require
these
roads
to
accept
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
&
western
system.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
fix
fair
and
equitable
terms
for
their
inclusion
and
they
are
free
to
accept
them
or
not.
and
this
is
one
of
the
places
where
the
difference
between
the
public
interest
and
the
private
interest
perhaps
most
clearly
appears.
the
situation
in
our
law
is
that
matters
of
this
sort
can
depend
a
good
deal
upon
the
action
of
the
stockholders
of
these
companies.
and
we
tend
to
think
when
we
look
at
things
superficially
that
of
course
the
stockholders
will
represent
all
interest.
that
becomes
difficult
to
uphold
when
we
think
in
terms
of
the
stockholders,
let
us
say
of
the
new
haven
railroad
who
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
have
any
remaining
interest
in
that
property
at
all
and
yet
it
may
well
be
that
unless
some
new
law
is
made
that
they
may
be
called
upon
to
approve
steps
which
are
taken
with
respect
to
the
new
haven
railroad.
now
with
respect
to
the
delaware
&
hudson
and
the
boston
&
maine,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
stockholders
had
been
put
in
a
place
where
they
can
negotiate,
bargain,
hold
up,
offer,
try
to
get
a
better
deal
and
it
is
to
their
interest
to
refrain
from
accepting
the
inclusion
terms
as
long
as
they
can
if
there
remains
any
conceivable
prospect
that
in
anyway
from
any
other
source,
they
might
get
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
which
would
be
more
attractive
to
them.
the
stockholders
in
this
situation
with
respect
to
both
of
these
companies,
delaware
&
hudson
and
boston
&
maine
obviously
had
been
put
in
a
position
where
they
have
simply
a
hold
up
value.
they
are
--
the
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
a
matter
of
very
great
importance
which
there
is
much
public
interest
and
which
there
is
great
private
interest.
they
sit
back
and
say,
“well,
we
haven't
made
up
our
minds.
we
don't
know
what
we're
going
to
do”.
there
is
great
concern
about
moving
the
merger
ahead
promptly
not
merely
because
of
the
private
interest
concerned
but
especially
because
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
new
haven
railroad
and
its
effect
on
transportation
to
the
whole
new
england
area.
now
when
one
looks
at
it
simply
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
is
the
way
that
i
can
get
the
most
out
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
reasonably
obvious
that
you
sit
back
and
wait
and
try
to
see
if
you
can't
get
any
better
offer
from
someone
in
the
situation
where
there
is
understood
to
be
no
power
to
require
the
inclusion
of
these
roads.
not
only
is
there
this
hold
up
value
in
the
situation
but
there
is
also
what
i
would
call
the
playoff
value.
that
you
not
only
have
the
right
to
hold
up
on
accepting
going
in
to
norfolk
&
western
with
the
great
leverage
from
the
fact
that
because
you're
hold
up,
you
tie
up
the
whole
merger
and
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
with
the
new
haven
and
all
the
other
things.
but
you
also
have
the
chance
to
try
to
stir
up
interest
with
respect
to
other
possible
customers
which
might
be
the
penn-central.
it
might
be
some
other
merger
which
could
be
worked
out
over
a
course
of
a
great
deal
of
time.
it
might
conceivably
be
some
sort
of
a
new
england
railroad,
the
viability
of
which
i
find
hard
to
be
sure
of.
the
norfolk
&
western
here
makes
a
great
deal
of
the
appendix
g
conditions
and
i
must
confess
that
i
find
some
sympathy
with
that
point
of
view
as
far
as
the
time
duration
of
those
conditions
are
involved.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
possible
to
bring
this
matter
to
a
conclusion
which
is
obviously
in
the
public
interest
if
some
formulation
were
found
which
would
require
the
boston
&
maine
and
the
delaware
&
hudson
either
to
accept
the
inclusion
conditions
or
to
know
that
they
would
have
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
which
is
a
very
hard
thing
for
them
to
do.
the
appendix
g
conditions
are
stated
in
--
that
is
the
duration,
the
term
of
them
are
stated
in
full
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
report.
it
seems
to
me
that
considering
how
these
matters
often
go
that
they
provide
a
period
which
might
extend
as
long
as
four
years
within
which
these
two
roads
could
continue
to
negotiate
and
seek
to
find
a
better
offer.
if
that
was
reduced
to
a
fixed,
flat
period,
six
months,
three
months,
it
might
be
possible
to
find
out
what
is
going
to
happen
here
and
have
something
more
fixed
and
specific
with
which
to
deal.
norfolk
&
western
complains
because
it
says
that,
as
it
now
stands,
it
is
going
to
be
required
to
take
the
erie-lackawanna
and
doesn't
know
whether
it
will
get
the
boston
&
maine
and
the
delaware
&
hudson.
it
points
out
that
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
below
and
incidentally
i
think
it's
not
inappropriate
to
say
that
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
remarkable
opinion
and
as
i
have
worked
on
this
case,
i've
constantly
found
myself
coming
back
to
it
and
finding
there
--
well,
set
out
the
answers
to
the
questions
which
were
published
--
puzzling
me.
norfolk
&
western
points
out
that
judge
friendly
said
on
page
61
of
his
opinion
that
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
the
erie-lackawanna's
penn-central
losses
in
the
event
that
the
delaware
&
hudson
was
not
included
and
that
is
true
but
that
is
really
an
alternative
ground
of
his
decision.
earlier
in
that
opinion,
two
or
three
pages
earlier,
judge
friendly
had
pointed
out
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue
was
with
respect
to
--
was
on
the
norfolk
&
western.
norfolk
&
western
was
in
no
sense
taken
by
surprise.
there
was
never
a
joint
petition
for
inclusion,
never
a
petition
that
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
&
hudson
and
boston
&
maine
should
be
included.
there
were
always
separate
petitions
for
inclusion
filed
by
each
road
and
as
judge
friendly
points
out
the
norfolk
&
western
was
the
custodian
of
the
figures
and
knowledge
and
it
had
the
burden
of
presenting
evidence
that
--
but
permitted
judgment
of
the
degree
to
which
the
petitioners
would
protect
this
traffic.
it
failed
to
do
that
even
on
the
assumption
that
all
three
were
included,
let
alone
on
less
probable
eventualities.
so
that
i
think
that
norfolk
&
western's
position
here
can
be
answered
on
the
ground
that
it
is
presented
rather
late
and
that
if
its
real
objection
is
that
it
ought
not
to
be
required
to
take
the
erie-lackawanna
alone,
it
should
have
presented
evidence
on
that
at
an
earlier
state
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
griswold
i'm
afraid
i
have
no
knowledge
about
that.
mr.
ginnane,
the
counsel
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
tells
me
there
has
been
no
such
finding.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
--
at
the
time
of
decision,
no
issue
before
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
of
these
three
lines
and
penn-central,
isn't
that
right
mr.
ginnane?
mr.
griswold
they
had
petitioned
for
inclusion
at
an
earlier
time
and
had
withdrawn
those
petitions
in
penn-central.
i
suppose
that
i
am
influenced
by
my
new
england
background
but
i
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
see
how
inclusion
of
these
three
roads
and
penn-central
could
conceivably
be
in
the
public
interest
because
it
would
mean
a
situation
of
complete
lack
of
competition
in
an
entire
area
of
the
country
and
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
has
so
found.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
actually
made
such
a
finding.
this
is
implicit
in
the
finding
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
for
them
to
be
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
merger.
i
suppose
that
what
the
commission
had
in
mind
was
that
you
can't
ever
foresee
what
things
will
be
in
the
future.
and
it
did
not
foreclose
for
all
time
completely
the
possibility
that
these
roads
might
become
a
part
of
penn-central.
mr.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
i
--
i
don't
think
i
--
mr.
griswold
then
i
would
be
greatly
surprised
if
they
would
find
it
here.
i'm
not
able
to
say
much
more
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
record
here
which
should
--
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
d.c.road
becoming
a
part
of
penn-central.
the
whole
underlying
basis
of
the
commission's
action
in
this
matter
in
providing
the
inclusion
order
shows
that
it
understood,
its
understanding
was
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
having
these
three
roads
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
system,
thus
providing
access
by
the
norfolk
&
western
from
buffalo
to
the
new
york
city
gateway
and
a
competition
among
railroads
in
new
england.
mr.
griswold
i
think
we're
in
--
mr.
griswold
i
think
we're
entirely
--
mr.
griswold
--
together.
mr.
griswold
yes,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
commission
has
done
that.
but
the
commission
has
no
power
to
require
them
to
accept
it.
mr.
griswold
and
that
is
our
--
mr.
griswold
--
precisely
our
position
and
it
is
the
reason
why
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
griswold
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
i
don't
think
we
have
taken
any
position
that
it
shouldn't
be
remanded
to
the
commission
to
give
oversight
as
to
how
it
is
carried
out
and
to
deal
with
matters
of
detail
in
the
process
of
carrying
out
the
merger.
mr.
griswold
i
don't
know
of
any
such
issue.
mr.
fooshee
has
raised
the
question
with
respect
to
bondholders
of
the
erie-lackawanna
as
to
whether
they
might
have
their
security
drained
away
by
the
action
of
the
combined
management.
i
would
suppose
that
no
reservation
was
needed
even
to
protect
the
--
that
interest
because
the
courts
of
equity
will
remain
open
and
if
the
management
favors
one
group
of
creditors
over
another
creditor
in
an
equity
court
or
conceivably
through
proceedings
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
take
care
of
it,
whether
any
reservation
is
made
or
not.
mr.
griswold
i
believe
--
mr.
griswold
i
believe
it
did.
this
is
--
mr.
griswold
i
believe
there
is
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction.
that
of
course
would
be
to
act
within
whatever
scope
and
ambit
is
left
after
this
court's
mandate.
