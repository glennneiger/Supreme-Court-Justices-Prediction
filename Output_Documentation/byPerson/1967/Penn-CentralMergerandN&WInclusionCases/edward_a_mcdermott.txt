mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
i
appear
for
the
boston
and
maine
corporation
in
this
case.
boston
and
maine
is
a
new
england
carrier
and
is
one
of
the
protected
roads
referred
to
in
penn-central.
its
service
has
been
found
by
the
commission
on
two
recent
occasions
at
least
to
be
essential
and
necessary
to
public
interest.
now
as
the
eastern
railroad
merger
pattern
began
to
evolve,
it
was
apparent
that
the
eventual
inclusion
of
boston
and
maine
in
a
larger
system
was
desirable
and
necessary.
boston
and
maine
together
with
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson
sought
inclusion
in
the
penn-central
merger
in
early
1963.
that
petition
was
denied
in
april
of
1966
without
prejudice
to
refiling
under
conditions
prescribed.
at
the
same
time
that
b
&
m
sought
inclusion
in
penn-central,
it
also
petitioned
for
inclusion
in
n
&
w-nickel
plate.
erie-lackawanna
subsequently
withdrew
from
that
proceeding
leaving
no
connection
for
b
&
m
with
n
&
w
and
b
&
m's
petition
was
again
denied
buthere
with
an
appendix
o
provision
with
which
this
court
is
familiar.
n
&
w
proceeded
with
consummation
of
its
unification
with
nickel
plate
and
other
roads
and
began
reaping
the
financial
rewards
of
that
enlarged
union
and
b
&
m
sought
negotiations
for
inclusion
in
that
system.
discussions
with
n
&
w
summarily
aborted
with
the
dereco
announcement
and
the
take
it
or
leave
it
position
by
n
&
w.
in
this
situation,
and
since
the
dereco
offer
unattractive
as
it
was,
was
subject
to
a
long
chronicle
of
conditions
precedent.
b
&
m's
petition
under
appendix
o
was
necessary
and
was
promptly
filed.
in
that
petition,
b
&
m
sought
merger
into
n
&
w
and
its
testimony
and
its
studies
and
its
evidence
of
value
were
based
primarily
on
merger.
oh,
important
to
an
understanding
of
the
commission's
action
with
reference
to
b
&
m
in
the
n
&
w
case
is
knowledge
that
n
&
w's
attitude
toward
the
properties
of
b
&
m
as
evidenced
in
that
hearing.
in
response
to
a
direct
question
from
commissioner
webb,
the
principal
policy
spokesman
of
n
&
w
replied
that
he
did
not
know
whether
n
&
w
would
want
b
&
m
if
it
were
required
by
the
commission
to
accept
erie
and
d
&
h.
again
in
final
oral
argument
before
the
full
commission
in
response
to
a
question
from
its
chairman,
n
&
w
counsel
responded
that
n
&
w
would
just
assume
--
see
b
&
m
go
into
penn-central
or
remain
outside
n
&
w
as
far
as
n
&
w
is
privately
concerned.
and
n
&
w
went
even
further.
it
told
the
full
commission
that
as
far
as
equity
to
n
&
w
was
concerned,
d
&
h
might
as
well
go
into
penn-central
along
with
b
&
m.
it
said,
“there
is
no
economic
justification
for
an
e-l,
d
&
h,
n
&
w
system”.
now
n
&
w
clearly
and
intentionally
created
the
impression.
it
had
no
real
interest
in
b
&
m.
b
&
m
intervened
in
the
d
&
h
appeal
to
the
inclusion
order
to
the
statutory
court.
its
position
there
as
it
is
here,
is
that
the
commission
committed
error
in
fixing
b
&
m's
value
as
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
n
&
w
because
it
failed
to
credit
b
&
m
properly
with
the
savings
and
traffics
gains
its
inclusion
will
bring
to
n
&
w.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
as
to
b
&
m.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct.
we
support
the
entire
balance
of
the
order.
now
b
&
m's
position
in
the
district
court
and
here
is
that
a
fair
in
equitable
terms
for
its
inclusion
in
n
&
w
cannot
be
found
on
the
record
and
commissioner
webb
suggested
they
could
not
be.
then
b
&
m's
petition
should
be
denied
and
it
should
not
be
foreclosed
from
seeking
a
haven
elsewhere.
a
brief
word
must
be
said
about
b
&
m
and
its
attitude
toward
the
penn-central
proceedings.
in
approving
that
merger,
the
commission
after
rehearing
has
provided
traffic
and
indemnity
provisions
which
has
revised
are
acceptable
to
b
&
m,
and
afford
the
interim
protection
it
requires.
b
&
m
did
not
participate
in
the
earlier
appeal
to
this
court
to
stay
penn-central
for
several
reasons.
it
was
of
the
opinion
then
and
it's
of
the
opinion
today
that
only
with
consummation
of
penn-central
will
n
&
w
which
to
this
point
has
been
successful
in
accomplishing
delay
have
the
economic
incentive
to
deal
fairly
and
expeditiously
to
include
b
&
m
as
an
element
of
its
system.
also,
at
the
time
of
the
appeal
to
this
court
in
the
last
instance,
b
&
m
had
assurance
by
the
commission
that
hearings
would
be
held
on
b
&
m's
request
for
strengthened
interim
protection.
and
finally,
because
of
its
location,
b
&
m
traffic
is
less
susceptible
to
diversion
to
a
merged
penn-central
than
e
&
l
and
d
&
h
traffic.
and
because
it
has
afforded
this
protection,
b
&
m
felt
that
on
balance,
the
public
interest
called
for
consummation.
b
&
m
supports
consummation
of
penn-central
provided
the
appendix
g
conditions
are
upheld
on
this
appeal
and
it
is
an
appellee
before
this
court
in
that
proceeding.
but
the
n
&
w
system
is
our
first
concern
and
our
primary
concern.
n
&
w
with
a
facility
often
demonstrated
over
the
years
of
these
proceedings
had
suddenly
and
dramatically
changed
the
emphasis
to
suit
its
purpose.
b
&
m
is
apparently
no
longer
the
unwanted
step
child
that
was
pictured
to
be
by
n
&
w
before
hearing
examiner
webb
and
the
commission.
suddenly
b
&
m
is
the
tail
that
wags
the
dog
and
if
b
&
m
finds
the
prescribed
terms
of
inclusion
unfair
and
inequitable,
the
whole
inclusion
case
must
fall.
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
as
appellees
arguments
will
develop.
i
call
again
the
court's
attention
to
a
statement
by
the
statutory
court
that
relates
to
a
question
asked
by
justice
white.
with
reference
to
b
&
m's
non-inclusion,
statutory
court
stated
at
page
61,
to
summarize,
there
is
a
sufficient
finding
supported
by
adequate
evidence
that
b
&
m's
non-inclusion
would
not
undermine
the
fairness
of
the
term
set
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson.
n
&
w's
representation
to
this
court
and
to
the
court
below
that
b
&
m
no
longer
regards
itself
as
a
prospective
affiliate
of
n
&
w
although
often
repeated
are
without
foundation.
i
repeat
again
as
we
state
in
our
motion
to
affirm,
b
&
m
seeks
inclusion
in
n
&
w
on
fair
and
equitable
terms.
if
it
does
not
succeed
in
that
effort,
b
&
m
would
be
willing
to
attempt
to
negotiate
terms
for
its
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w-c
&
o
system
even
though
b
&
m
realizes
that
their
proposed
merger
faces
serious
problems
and
that
n
&
w's
chief
executive
officer
has
termed
the
n
&
w-c
&
o
proposal
to
b
&
m
as
a
take
it
or
leave
it
proposition.
only
if
both
of
those
possibilities
fail
will
b
&
m
turn
other
alternatives
to
ensure
a
continuation
of
its
essential
services.
b
&
m
submits
that
the
n
&
w
--
that
in
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case,
the
commission
based
its
essential
findings
as
to
the
public
interest
on
important
substantive
findings
that
under
n
&
w
control,
petitioner
including
the
boston
and
maine
will
be
able
to
achieve
substantial
savings.
it
found
that
the
petitioners
as
well
as
the
public
will
benefit
from
unified
management
of
what
is
now
several
companies
operating
independently.
and
to
quote,
the
commission
had
found
that
among
others
such
benefits
will
include
joint
routes
of
affiliated
lines.
the
prospect
of
single
line
service,
elimination
of
interchanges,
improved
schedules
and
more
flexible
distribution
of
equipment,
with
that
one
exception,
b
&
m
did
not
receive
credit
for
the
savings
achievable
through
the
unifications
which
the
commission
found
would
occur.
b
&
m
received
credit
for
it
but
one
element
of
savings,
the
consolidation
of
traffic
solicitation
forces
with
an
annual
value
of
$328,000.
now
since
the
commission
clearly
rejected,
petitioner's
witness
wires
assumption
that
the
opportunity
for
savings
under
control
would
be
so
limited.
we
submit
it
acted
arbitrarily
in
basing
b
&
m's
value
on
those
limited
sales.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
$328,000
a
year
in
annual
savings
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
substantial.
the
four-way
merger
saving
studies
which
were
introduced
by
the
same
witness
wire
for
erie,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
went
unchallenged
by
n
&
w.
b
&
m's
allocable
share
of
those
savings
exceeded
$3
million.
the
$3
million
annual
savings
obtainable
upon
complete
integration
of
b
&
m's
operations
into
n
&
w
are
substantial
and
afford
a
measure
of
the
amount
of
b
&
m
contribution
to
savings
actually
attainable
when
the
managements
of
these
four
roads
are
unified
and
the
operations
integrated.
equitable
terms
must
reflect
but
b
&
m
will
contribute
to
the
enlarged
n
&
w
system.
that
was
a
holding
of
the
schwabacher
case.
b
&
m's
value
cannot
be
determined
fairly
unless
consideration
is
accorded,
its
savings
contribution
to
the
new
system.
the
economic
consequences
of
the
commission's
failure
to
do
so
should
not
be
imposed
on
b
&
m
by
application
of
the
doctrine
of
administrative
finality.
now
as
a
consequence
of
this
failure
to
properly
credit
b
&
m
with
its
contribution,
an
exchange
ratio
was
proposed
for
b
&
m
of
one
or
ten
which
would
result
in
a
reduction
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
three
million
dollars
below
its
book
value.
from
$114
million
to
$10.8
million
and
it
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
yes,
it
was
the
--
it
would
be
fair
to
say
it
was
contented.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
commission,
as
to
b
&
m,
accepted
figures
in
the
record
submitted
by
a
joint
witness
for
the
petitioning
railroads.
based
on
savings
resulting
from
a
form
of
control
that
was
very
different
than
the
commission
found
would
be
the
type
of
control
n
&
w
would
in
fact
exercise
to
meet
the
public
interest
requirement
in
their
finding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well,
there
--
yes
there
were
--
so-called
four
were
--
four
way
merger
study
introduced
which
reflected
substantially
the
types
of
unifications
of
management
that
the
commission
details
in
its
finding
and
in
its
order
in
which
it
says
n
&
w
can
accomplish
under
control.
our
position
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
the
commission
has
found
that
this
is
the
type
of
unification
that
is
going
to
result
and
it
has
so
found,
then
we
should
be
credited
fairly
with
the
contribution
that
b
&
m
will
make
to
a
system
operated
in
that
manner.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
presented
jointly
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that
would
be
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
no,
b
&
o
was
not
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
it
has
not.
it
has
not
been
submitted
and
i
might
say
on
that
sir
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well,
this
is
a
hazardous
area
in
which
to
make
a
prediction
as
to
future
litigation.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
what
more
--
what
would
more
likely
happen
is
a
submission
of
the
terms
as
ultimately
determined
by
the
commission
and
the
stockholders
of
boston
and
maine
would
vote
on
those
and
they
would
accept
or
reject.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
then
the
corporation
would
be
based
with
the
procedural
consequences
of
that
action.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
--
that
is
substantially
correct
mr.
justice.
but
i
believe
it's
also
correct
to
say
that
our
position
here
as
to
b
&
m
is
that
we
say
that
the
commission
acted
unreasonably
in
failing
to
properly
credit
boston
and
maine
with
the
savings
it
will
make
to
the
system,
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
section
8
(b),
that
the
--
the
court
can
take
a
look
at
that
question.
the
only
exchange
ratio
that
we're
concerned
with
of
course
is
our
own
and
i
must
take
that
i
cannot
presently
foresee
any
situation
where
that
issue
could
properly
again
be
brought
before
this
court
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
then
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
then
--
well,
then
you'd
--
your
stockholders
rejected
the
offer,
i
don't
know,
would
you
have
a
court
remedy
at
that
point?
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
i
would
think
not
sir.
i
would
think
not.
to
conclude,
i
would
like
to
state
that
to
correct
the
error
as
to
b
&
m
and
it
is
substantial
error.
the
proceedings
need
only
be
remanded
to
the
commission
for
a
limited
further
hearings
and
findings
as
to
the
value
consistent
with
its
findings
as
to
the
type
of
control
exercised.
under
such
an
order,
penn-central
can
be
consummated,
and
resolution
of
the
new
haven
problem
can
proceed.
the
finding
of
the
statutory
court
as
to
e
&
l
and
d
&
h
in
the
inclusion
case
can
be
affirmed
and
their
inclusion
that
n
&
w
can
proceed
subject
to
appropriate
vote
of
the
stock
--
of
d
&
h
stockholders.
as
the
district
court
stated
remand
for
the
purpose
of
stock
by
b
&
m
would
in
no
way
prevent
inclusion
but
rather
would
facilitate
it.
under
such
an
order,
b
&
m
can
subsequently
and
hopefully
soon
join
that
enlarged
system
if
fair
terms
are
prescribed.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
this
i
don't
know.
i
don't
believe
it
was
--
forwarded
here,
you
mean
the
--
of
last
year
of
september
1966?
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
record
at
the
commission
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
you
know
you
did
not
have
the
record
of
the
icc
in
the
penn-central
case.
it
was
up
here
on
interlocutory
injunction
and
the
record
was
not
filed
here.
and
it
wasn't
filed
this
time
and
it
will
be
filed
however
in
pennsylvania.
none
of
these
railroad
parties
are
attacking
the
public
interest
of
penn-central,
so
they
didn't
follow
the
record.
it's
only
us.
we're
the
only
people.
and
one
reason
that
we've
been
having
a
lot
of
trouble
is
that
the
commission
has
stacked
up
at
the
icc
a
whole
series
of
case
by
case
mergers
for
the
western
district
and
we
just
saw
the
great
northern
--
northern
pacific
merger
come
down
the
other
day.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
northern
lines
merger
was
announced
by
the
commission
on
november
30th
and
it
reversed
the
decision
which
they
had
denied
that,
northern
lines
merger,
and
that
decision
was
released
the
same
day
as
the
penn-central
merger
was
april
27th,
1966.
and
the
case
by
case
method
is
all
stacked
up
and
unless
something
happens,
we're
going
to
have
--
i
feel
damage
in
the
east
and
all
over
the
country.
thank
you,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
i
appear
for
the
boston
and
maine
corporation
in
this
case.
boston
and
maine
is
a
new
england
carrier
and
is
one
of
the
protected
roads
referred
to
in
penn-central.
its
service
has
been
found
by
the
commission
on
two
recent
occasions
at
least
to
be
essential
and
necessary
to
public
interest.
now
as
the
eastern
railroad
merger
pattern
began
to
evolve,
it
was
apparent
that
the
eventual
inclusion
of
boston
and
maine
in
a
larger
system
was
desirable
and
necessary.
boston
and
maine
together
with
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson
sought
inclusion
in
the
penn-central
merger
in
early
1963.
that
petition
was
denied
in
april
of
1966
without
prejudice
to
refiling
under
conditions
prescribed.
at
the
same
time
that
b
&
m
sought
inclusion
in
penn-central,
it
also
petitioned
for
inclusion
in
n
&
w-nickel
plate.
erie-lackawanna
subsequently
withdrew
from
that
proceeding
leaving
no
connection
for
b
&
m
with
n
&
w
and
b
&
m's
petition
was
again
denied
buthere
with
an
appendix
o
provision
with
which
this
court
is
familiar.
n
&
w
proceeded
with
consummation
of
its
unification
with
nickel
plate
and
other
roads
and
began
reaping
the
financial
rewards
of
that
enlarged
union
and
b
&
m
sought
negotiations
for
inclusion
in
that
system.
discussions
with
n
&
w
summarily
aborted
with
the
dereco
announcement
and
the
take
it
or
leave
it
position
by
n
&
w.
in
this
situation,
and
since
the
dereco
offer
unattractive
as
it
was,
was
subject
to
a
long
chronicle
of
conditions
precedent.
b
&
m's
petition
under
appendix
o
was
necessary
and
was
promptly
filed.
in
that
petition,
b
&
m
sought
merger
into
n
&
w
and
its
testimony
and
its
studies
and
its
evidence
of
value
were
based
primarily
on
merger.
oh,
important
to
an
understanding
of
the
commission's
action
with
reference
to
b
&
m
in
the
n
&
w
case
is
knowledge
that
n
&
w's
attitude
toward
the
properties
of
b
&
m
as
evidenced
in
that
hearing.
in
response
to
a
direct
question
from
commissioner
webb,
the
principal
policy
spokesman
of
n
&
w
replied
that
he
did
not
know
whether
n
&
w
would
want
b
&
m
if
it
were
required
by
the
commission
to
accept
erie
and
d
&
h.
again
in
final
oral
argument
before
the
full
commission
in
response
to
a
question
from
its
chairman,
n
&
w
counsel
responded
that
n
&
w
would
just
assume
--
see
b
&
m
go
into
penn-central
or
remain
outside
n
&
w
as
far
as
n
&
w
is
privately
concerned.
and
n
&
w
went
even
further.
it
told
the
full
commission
that
as
far
as
equity
to
n
&
w
was
concerned,
d
&
h
might
as
well
go
into
penn-central
along
with
b
&
m.
it
said,
“there
is
no
economic
justification
for
an
e-l,
d
&
h,
n
&
w
system”.
now
n
&
w
clearly
and
intentionally
created
the
impression.
it
had
no
real
interest
in
b
&
m.
b
&
m
intervened
in
the
d
&
h
appeal
to
the
inclusion
order
to
the
statutory
court.
its
position
there
as
it
is
here,
is
that
the
commission
committed
error
in
fixing
b
&
m's
value
as
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
n
&
w
because
it
failed
to
credit
b
&
m
properly
with
the
savings
and
traffics
gains
its
inclusion
will
bring
to
n
&
w.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
as
to
b
&
m.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct.
we
support
the
entire
balance
of
the
order.
now
b
&
m's
position
in
the
district
court
and
here
is
that
a
fair
in
equitable
terms
for
its
inclusion
in
n
&
w
cannot
be
found
on
the
record
and
commissioner
webb
suggested
they
could
not
be.
then
b
&
m's
petition
should
be
denied
and
it
should
not
be
foreclosed
from
seeking
a
haven
elsewhere.
a
brief
word
must
be
said
about
b
&
m
and
its
attitude
toward
the
penn-central
proceedings.
in
approving
that
merger,
the
commission
after
rehearing
has
provided
traffic
and
indemnity
provisions
which
has
revised
are
acceptable
to
b
&
m,
and
afford
the
interim
protection
it
requires.
b
&
m
did
not
participate
in
the
earlier
appeal
to
this
court
to
stay
penn-central
for
several
reasons.
it
was
of
the
opinion
then
and
it's
of
the
opinion
today
that
only
with
consummation
of
penn-central
will
n
&
w
which
to
this
point
has
been
successful
in
accomplishing
delay
have
the
economic
incentive
to
deal
fairly
and
expeditiously
to
include
b
&
m
as
an
element
of
its
system.
also,
at
the
time
of
the
appeal
to
this
court
in
the
last
instance,
b
&
m
had
assurance
by
the
commission
that
hearings
would
be
held
on
b
&
m's
request
for
strengthened
interim
protection.
and
finally,
because
of
its
location,
b
&
m
traffic
is
less
susceptible
to
diversion
to
a
merged
penn-central
than
e
&
l
and
d
&
h
traffic.
and
because
it
has
afforded
this
protection,
b
&
m
felt
that
on
balance,
the
public
interest
called
for
consummation.
b
&
m
supports
consummation
of
penn-central
provided
the
appendix
g
conditions
are
upheld
on
this
appeal
and
it
is
an
appellee
before
this
court
in
that
proceeding.
but
the
n
&
w
system
is
our
first
concern
and
our
primary
concern.
n
&
w
with
a
facility
often
demonstrated
over
the
years
of
these
proceedings
had
suddenly
and
dramatically
changed
the
emphasis
to
suit
its
purpose.
b
&
m
is
apparently
no
longer
the
unwanted
step
child
that
was
pictured
to
be
by
n
&
w
before
hearing
examiner
webb
and
the
commission.
suddenly
b
&
m
is
the
tail
that
wags
the
dog
and
if
b
&
m
finds
the
prescribed
terms
of
inclusion
unfair
and
inequitable,
the
whole
inclusion
case
must
fall.
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
as
appellees
arguments
will
develop.
i
call
again
the
court's
attention
to
a
statement
by
the
statutory
court
that
relates
to
a
question
asked
by
justice
white.
with
reference
to
b
&
m's
non-inclusion,
statutory
court
stated
at
page
61,
to
summarize,
there
is
a
sufficient
finding
supported
by
adequate
evidence
that
b
&
m's
non-inclusion
would
not
undermine
the
fairness
of
the
term
set
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson.
n
&
w's
representation
to
this
court
and
to
the
court
below
that
b
&
m
no
longer
regards
itself
as
a
prospective
affiliate
of
n
&
w
although
often
repeated
are
without
foundation.
i
repeat
again
as
we
state
in
our
motion
to
affirm,
b
&
m
seeks
inclusion
in
n
&
w
on
fair
and
equitable
terms.
if
it
does
not
succeed
in
that
effort,
b
&
m
would
be
willing
to
attempt
to
negotiate
terms
for
its
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w-c
&
o
system
even
though
b
&
m
realizes
that
their
proposed
merger
faces
serious
problems
and
that
n
&
w's
chief
executive
officer
has
termed
the
n
&
w-c
&
o
proposal
to
b
&
m
as
a
take
it
or
leave
it
proposition.
only
if
both
of
those
possibilities
fail
will
b
&
m
turn
other
alternatives
to
ensure
a
continuation
of
its
essential
services.
b
&
m
submits
that
the
n
&
w
--
that
in
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case,
the
commission
based
its
essential
findings
as
to
the
public
interest
on
important
substantive
findings
that
under
n
&
w
control,
petitioner
including
the
boston
and
maine
will
be
able
to
achieve
substantial
savings.
it
found
that
the
petitioners
as
well
as
the
public
will
benefit
from
unified
management
of
what
is
now
several
companies
operating
independently.
and
to
quote,
the
commission
had
found
that
among
others
such
benefits
will
include
joint
routes
of
affiliated
lines.
the
prospect
of
single
line
service,
elimination
of
interchanges,
improved
schedules
and
more
flexible
distribution
of
equipment,
with
that
one
exception,
b
&
m
did
not
receive
credit
for
the
savings
achievable
through
the
unifications
which
the
commission
found
would
occur.
b
&
m
received
credit
for
it
but
one
element
of
savings,
the
consolidation
of
traffic
solicitation
forces
with
an
annual
value
of
$328,000.
now
since
the
commission
clearly
rejected,
petitioner's
witness
wires
assumption
that
the
opportunity
for
savings
under
control
would
be
so
limited.
we
submit
it
acted
arbitrarily
in
basing
b
&
m's
value
on
those
limited
sales.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
$328,000
a
year
in
annual
savings
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
substantial.
the
four-way
merger
saving
studies
which
were
introduced
by
the
same
witness
wire
for
erie,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
went
unchallenged
by
n
&
w.
b
&
m's
allocable
share
of
those
savings
exceeded
$3
million.
the
$3
million
annual
savings
obtainable
upon
complete
integration
of
b
&
m's
operations
into
n
&
w
are
substantial
and
afford
a
measure
of
the
amount
of
b
&
m
contribution
to
savings
actually
attainable
when
the
managements
of
these
four
roads
are
unified
and
the
operations
integrated.
equitable
terms
must
reflect
but
b
&
m
will
contribute
to
the
enlarged

system.
that
was
a
holding
of
the
schwabacher
case.
b
&
m's
value
cannot
be
determined
fairly
unless
consideration
is
accorded,
its
savings
contribution
to
the
new

the
economic
consequences
of
the
commission's
failure
to
do
so
should
not
be
imposed
on
b
&
m
by
application
of
the
doctrine
of
administrative
finality.
now
as
a
consequence
of
this
failure
to
properly
credit
b
&
m
with
its
contribution,
an
exchange
ratio
was
proposed
for
b
&
m
of
one
or
ten
which
would
result
in
a
reduction
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
three
million
dollars
below
its
book
value.
from
$114
million
to
$10.8
million
and
it
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
yes,
it
was
the
--
it
would
be
fair
to
say
it
was
contented.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
commission,
as
to
b
&
m,
accepted
figures
in
the
record
submitted
by
a
joint
witness
for
the
petitioning
railroads.
based
on
savings
resulting
from
a
form
of
control
that
was
very
different
than
the
commission
found
would
be
the
type
of
control
n
&
w
would
in
fact
exercise
to
meet
the
public
interest
requirement
in
their
finding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well,
there
--
yes
there
were
--
so-called
four
were
--
four
way
merger
study
introduced
which
reflected
substantially
the
types
of
unifications
of
management
that
the
commission
details
in
its
finding
and
in
its
order
in
which
it
says
n
&
w
can
accomplish
under
control.
our
position
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
the
commission
has
found
that
this
is
the
type
of
unification
that
is
going
to
result
and
it
has
so
found,
then
we
should
be
credited
fairly
with
the
contribution
that
b
&
m
will
make
to
a
system
operated
in
that
manner.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
presented
jointly
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that
would
be
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
no,
b
&
o
was
not
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
no,
it
has
not.
it
has
not
been
submitted
and
i
might
say
on
that
sir
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
well,
this
is
a
hazardous
area
in
which
to
make
a
prediction
as
to
future
litigation.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
what
more
--
what
would
more
likely
happen
is
a
submission
of
the
terms
as
ultimately
determined
by
the
commission
and
the
stockholders
of
boston
and
maine
would
vote
on
those
and
they
would
accept
or
reject.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
then
the
corporation
would
be
based
with
the
procedural
consequences
of
that
action.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
that
is
correct
--
that
is
substantially
correct
mr.
justice.
but
i
believe
it's
also
correct
to
say
that
our
position
here
as
to
b
&
m
is
that
we
say
that
the
commission
acted
unreasonably
in
failing
to
properly
credit
boston
and
maine
with
the
savings
it
will
make
to
the
system,
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
section
8
(b),
that
the
--
the
court
can
take
a
look
at
that
question.
the
only
exchange
ratio
that
we're
concerned
with
of
course
is
our
own
and
i
must
take
that
i
cannot
presently
foresee
any
situation
where
that
issue
could
properly
again
be
brought
before
this
court
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
and
then
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
then
--
well,
then
you'd
--
your
stockholders
rejected
the
offer,
i
don't
know,
would
you
have
a
court
remedy
at
that
point?
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
i
would
think
not
sir.
i
would
think
not.
to
conclude,
i
would
like
to
state
that
to
correct
the
error
as
to
b
&
m
and
it
is
substantial
error.
the
proceedings
need
only
be
remanded
to
the
commission
for
a
limited
further
hearings
and
findings
as
to
the
value
consistent
with
its
findings
as
to
the
type
of
control
exercised.
under
such
an
order,
penn-central
can
be
consummated,
and
resolution
of
the
new
haven
problem
can
proceed.
the
finding
of
the
statutory
court
as
to
e
&
l
and
d
&
h
in
the
inclusion
case
can
be
affirmed
and
their
inclusion
that
n
&
w
can
proceed
subject
to
appropriate
vote
of
the
stock
--
of
d
&
h
stockholders.
as
the
district
court
stated
remand
for
the
purpose
of
stock
by
b
&
m
would
in
no
way
prevent
inclusion
but
rather
would
facilitate
it.
under
such
an
order,
b
&
m
can
subsequently
and
hopefully
soon
join
that
enlarged
system
if
fair
terms
are
prescribed.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
this
i
don't
know.
i
don't
believe
it
was
--
forwarded
here,
you
mean
the
--
of
last
year
of
september
1966?
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
record
at
the
commission
--
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
you
know
you
did
not
have
the
record
of
the
icc
in
the
penn-central
case.
it
was
up
here
on
interlocutory
injunction
and
the
record
was
not
filed
here.
and
it
wasn't
filed
this
time
and
it
will
be
filed
however
in
pennsylvania.
none
of
these
railroad
parties
are
attacking
the
public
interest
of
penn-central,
so
they
didn't
follow
the
record.
it's
only
us.
we're
the
only
people.
and
one
reason
that
we've
been
having
a
lot
of
trouble
is
that
the
commission
has
stacked
up
at
the
icc
a
whole
series
of
case
by
case
mergers
for
the
western
district
and
we
just
saw
the
great
northern
--
northern
pacific
merger
come
down
the
other
day.
mr.
edward
a.
mcdermott
the
northern
lines
merger
was
announced
by
the
commission
on
november
30th
and
it
reversed
the
decision
