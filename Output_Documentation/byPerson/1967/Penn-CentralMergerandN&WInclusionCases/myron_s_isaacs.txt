oscar
gruss
&
son
holders
with
affiliates
of
over
14%
of
the
first
mortgage
bonds
of
the
new
haven
railroad
and
the
committee
representing
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
of
the
new
haven.
the
new
haven
has
been
bankrupt
since
1961.
the
bonds
have
been
in
default,
$77
million
is
the
approximate
principal
amount,
$98
million
that
are
claimed
today.
these
are
bonds
that
were
issued
in
1947
with
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
last
three
organization
of
the
new
haven.
they
were
issued
along
with
about
over
$200
million
of
income
bonds,
preferred
stock,
common
stock
that
were
supposed
to
be
comparatively
the
risk
securities.
divisional
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
then
who
had
bonds
with
longer,
with
their
higher
interest
rates
and
shorter
maturities
were
required
to
take
these
first
mortgage
bonds
that
would
--
of
such
high
quality,
marketability,
coverage
of
interest,
and
everything
else.
well,
they
went
into
default
1961.
the
trustees
who
are
appointed
in
the
reorganization
intervened
in
the
penn-central
merger
proceedings
in
1962.
they
sought
a
complete
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
in
the
merged
penn-central
to
be
required
by
the
commission
as
a
condition
precedent
to
consummation
of
the
merger.
the
position
of
the
penn-central
at
that
time
were
opposed
that
they
suggested
an
operating
agreement,
they
would
take
in
the
operations
of
the
penn-central
for
a
period
of
--
by
10
years
was
suggested.
the
idea
was
that
they
could
realize
the
same
savings
of
about
$5,200,000
a
year
that
the
trustees
had
shown
would
result
from
inclusion
of
the
operations
by
a
complete
transfer
of
the
properties.
well,
after
those
briefs
have
been
filed,
they
came
to
agreement,
the
new
haven
trustees
and
the
penn-central
management.
they
agreed
to
a
sale
of
all
the
new
haven
properties
to
the
penn-central.
the
trustees
would
try
to
abandon
the
passenger
operations.
the
--
they
would
receive
some
day
a
price
which
penn-cetral
was
willing
to
pay.
in
return,
the
trustees
themselves
would
use
their
best
efforts
as
trustees
to
see
that
the
proposed
price
was
approved
by
the
commission
and
the
reorganization
court
was
consummated.
and
the
new
haven
trustees
also
have
made
the
specific
agreement
to
limit
any
statements
they
might
make
in
the
merger
proceedings,
any
documents
they
might
file
even
in
the
merger
proceedings
or
in
review
proceedings
such
as
this,
so
that
their
statements
and
their
filings
would
be
consistent
with
the
provisions
and
intent
of
that
agreement.
that
agreement
has
created
some
very
substantial
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
commitments
of
the
trustees
to
penn
and
central
and
the
interest
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
fiduciaries.
the
commission
came
to
its
first
decisions
in
april
of
1966.
and
the
new
haven
abandonment
of
passenger
service
case,
they
denied
the
right
to
abandon
most
of
the
passenger
trains.
in
the
penn-central
merger
case,
they
approved
the
merger
of
penn
and
central
subject
to
certain
conditions
affecting
various
railroads.
as
far
as
the
new
haven
was
concerned,
the
commission
made
the
specific
finding
that
without
complete
inclusion
of
the
new
haven,
the
penn-central
merger
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
that
finding
made
in
april
of
1966
was
repeated
again
in
the
november
1967
report.
the
condition
however
that
the
commission
required
was
not
the
inclusion,
actual
inclusion.
it
was
a
commitment
of
penn-central
to
include
the
new
haven
operation
someday
on
terms
to
be
approved
or
proposed
by
the
commission.
until
after
the
entry
of
the
order
of
the
court
below
until
after
this
appeal
--
these
appeals
have
been
docketed,
the
commission
had
never
dealt
on
the
merits
with
the
position
of
gruss
that
there
cannot
be
any
reasonable
assurance
of
actual
inclusion
or
any
actual
inclusion
on
fair
and
reasonable
terms
unless
the
operations
of
the
new
haven
are
taken
over
concurrently
with
consummation
of
the
merger
of
penn
and
central.
now,
its
--
this
is
a
very
important
difference.
it's
one
thing
to
keep
the
new
haven
alive
by
loans
as
far
as
the
constitutional
rights
of
bondholders
are
concerned,
this
means
a
continued
erosion
and
eating
up
of
their
property.
on
the
basis
of
the
november
1967
report
of
the
commission,
the
entire
price
that
would
be
paid
by
penn
and
central,
the
commission
approved
where
penn
and
central
was
willing
to
pay,
would
give
the
new
haven
trustees
for
the
first
mortgage
bondholders,
either
$50
million
if
you
can
value
the
pennsylvania
railroad
stock
at
the
speculative
price
that's
fixed
by
the
commission
of
8750
a
share
or
on
present
market
value,
you've
got
$20
million
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds.
let's
assume
that
you
have
an
immediate
inclusion
today
or
as
of
august
31,
1967.
with
everyday
that
passes,
every
month,
every
year,
the
--
what's
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
is
less
and
less.
it's
eroded
in
two
ways.
one
is
just
by
the
operations,
the
new
haven
trustees
don't
pay
all
--
don't
pay
any
taxes
really.
they
keep
accumulating.
they
don't
pay
rentals,
most
of
their
rentals
for
railroad
cars
and
their
other
administration
expenses
that
reflect
the
erosion
of
basic
position
in
a
decline
of
assets
that
are
leftover
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds,
a
deprivation
of
property
that
the
extent
that
it
isn't
absolutely
necessary
as
utterly
without
due
process
of
law.
and
secondly,
you
have
the
enhancement
of
that
deprivation
of
property
both
by
the
refusal
to
prevent
abandonment
of
passenger
service
and
now
by
the
refusal
to
provide
for
inclusion
at
the
time
you
consummate
the
merger.
there
are
a
number
of
areas
of
specific
constitutional
rights
that
the
commission
in
the
court
below
just
completely
disregard.
one
is
the
right
under
decisions
of
this
court,
railroad
commission
of
texas
against
east
texas
at
what
--
one
of
them
--
the
right
to
--
the
owners
of
a
railroad
property
if
they
cannot
operate
it
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
return,
they
have
a
right
to
abandon
operations
and
to
take
the
salvage
value
that
they
have.
this
is
a
right
which
the
commission
is
prohibiting
in
the
name
of
the
public
interest
in
keeping
the
new
haven
alive.
these
are
loss
operations
which
the
commission
recognizes,
will
continue
to
be
loss
operations
as
long
as
they
kept
separate
for
penn
and
central.
this
right
to
stop
the
losses
and
take
the
salvage
value
is
a
vital
right
which
is
being
denied
that
--
of
the
first
mortgage
bondholders.
the
second
right
is
the
one
involved
with
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
st.
joe
paper
case.
before
you
can
have
properly
a
bankrupt
railroad
included
in
another
railroad,
you
have
to
give
the
owners
of
the
equity,
the
bondholders
in
this
case,
the
right
to
vote
on
the
inclusion.
this
has
attempt
to
force
inclusion
without
giving
bondholders
anything
to
say
about
it,
without
letting
the
bondholders
as
security
holders
know
what
is
in
store
for
them
if
the
commission
price
is
approved.
and
finally,
you
get
the
general
attempt
to
force
a
transaction
which
will
leave
bondholders
with
far
less
than
the
amount
of
their
claim,
again,
without
a
vote
in
violation
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
radford
case
and
the
requirement
of
a
balancing
of
public
and
private
equities
in
the
denver
&
rio
grande
case.
once
this
merger
is
consummated
with
the
erosion
of
the
new
haven
continuing,
there
will
be
no
more
power
either
in
the
commission
or
in
the
courts
to
protect
the
property
rights
of
bondholders.
the
bondholders
are
in
a
position
of
seeing
their
property
disappearing
no
matter
who
contests
what
is
done
by
the
commission
and
the
courts.
if
you
assume
the
current
price
which
cuts
out
all
junior
bonds,
which
cuts
out
all
of
creditors
other
than
bondholders,
you're
going
to
have
litigation
by
those
classes
regardless
of
what
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
do
and
during
that
litigation
every
month
and
every
year
it
goes
on,
you
have
a
decline
in
the
property
that
is
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds,
an
erosion
of
their
property.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
the
courts
responding
to
the
appeals
from
the
commission
order
and
requiring
an
increase
in
price,
then
the
same
erosion
can
be
had
at
the
option
of
penn-central.
they
can
litigate
forever
while
the
bondholders
bear
the
cost,
while
the
property
of
the
new
haven
disappears.
and
there
is
no
way
of
compelling
them
to
stop
or
compelling
the
losses
to
stop
except
by
having
the
commission
do
what
its
public
interest
findings
require
it
to
do.
to
have
the
new
haven
included
when
you
have
penn
and
central
merged.
it
is
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
wholly
feasible
to
do
that.
yes.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
if
you
had
a
final
solution
by
lease,
that
would
--
there
would
be
some
either
acceptance
by
new
haven
or
crammed
down
by
the
courts.
i
think
the
dilemma
would
be
satisfied
in
this
--
or
avoided
in
this
situation
if
you
have
inclusion
on
an
interim
basis
now.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
start
with
inclusion
--
by
a
lease
if
you
will,
by
a
lease
with
the
term
--
with
the
read
terms
to
be
fixed
later,
by
a
conveyance
with
the
price
to
be
fixed
later,
by
an
operating
agreement
with
--
that
as
long
as
you
have
the
immediate
takeover
of
the
operations
by
the
penn
and
--
by
the
merged
penn-central,
it's
my
judgment
that
you
could
leave
the
fixing
of
terms
to
a
later
process.
you
would've
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
stopped
the
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
i
don't
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
and
nobody
would
be
at
anybody's
mercy
at
that
point.
the
--
everybody
would
have
the
right
to
argue
about
terms
if
penn-central
were
so
advised.
they
are
not
blocked
from
arguing
that
the
losses
that
are
--
they
incur
--
if
they
incur
any
losses
should
be
subtracted
from
the
price.
they're
not
stopped
from
arguing
anything
that
they
maybe
advised
to
argue
by
the
fact
of
immediate
inclusion.
the
bondholders
are
in
an
entirely
different
situation.
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
people
on
both
sides
of
them.
the
junior
securities
of
the
--
the
junior
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
and
the
other
creditors
of
the
new
haven
under
one
hand
and
penn-central
on
the
other,
they
are
boxed
in
and
squeezed
and
unable
to
have
court
attention,
court
review
that
is
meaningful
of
their
claim
of
right.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
they've
no
power
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
could
hope
to
have
power
equivalent
to
that
at
penn-central,
we
can't
and
don't.
but
we
should
have
the
limited
power
not
to
be
boxed
in,
in
a
situation
where
we
have
no
control
over
the
continued
desperate
erosion
of
our
equity.
the
bondholders
are
in
a
unique
--
that
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
are
in
the
unique
position
here
of
having
people
who
--
to
whom
further
erosion
means
nothing,
able
to
litigate
and
expose
the
errors
of
the
commission.
on
the
one
hand,
and
if
they
are
correct
in
having
the
penn-central
able
to
do
it
and
no
matter
who's
doing
it,
this
erosion
continues
indefinitely
under
the
commission
decisions.
it
is
an
erosion
which
practically
can
be
stopped.
the
commission
can
see
that
the
word,
the
findings
of
the
commission
are
upheld,
that
are
matched
by
actual
transactions
if
you
have
inclusion
taking
place
at
the
time
of
the
merger
granted
that
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
of
the
inclusion
being
something
less
than
permanent.
it
still
--
there
still
will
have
been
inclusion
and
the
chances
are
that
it
will
be
permanent
that
the
claims
of
right
will
be
finally
resolved
without
the
kind
of
hammer
that's
over
the
head
of
the
bondholders
today.
i
don't
think
that
the
dilemma
is
realistically
a
serious
one
but
the
dilemma
of
the
bondholders
is
really
an
impossible.
it
is
not
only
the
bondholders
it's
also
the
reorganization
court.
the
court
on
july
--
in
its
july
11
opinion,
requested
bondholders
to
apply
to
the
commission
for
immediate
inclusion
by
way
of
a
lease
so
that
at
the
time
of
merger
you
would
have
a
cessation
of
the
drainage
away
of
the
estate.
the
request
was
made
by
its
order
of
august
1,
the
commission
seemed
to
be
saying
until
the
court
below
that
it
was
saying
that
it
has
set
up
a
machinery
for
the
operations
of
the
new
haven
to
be
included
as
soon
as
the
merger
takes
place.
that
machinery
has
now
been
abandoned.
the
commission
hadn't
decided
completely
apparently
whether
to
abandon
at
the
time
the
court
made
its
decision,
the
court
took
the
intentions
of
the
commission
as
a
substitute
for
action
by
the
commission
to
see
that
the
inclusion
takes
place.
at
this
point,
by
the
november
order,
the
commission
has
abandoned
and
has
left
the
bondholders
and
the
court
in
an
impossible
debate,
nobody
controls
penn-central.
and
once,
except
the
commission,
the
penn-central
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceeding
before
the
reorganization
court.
and
unless
this
court
acts,
it
will
be
impossible
to
have
inclusion
at
anytime
on
any
kind
of
fair
and
reasonable
terms.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
the
time
allotted
for
rebuttal
by
mr.
migdal.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
the
appellants
in
numbers
830
and
831.
oscar
gruss
&
son
holders
with
affiliates
of
over
14%
of
the
first
mortgage
bonds
of
the
new
haven
railroad
and
the
committee
representing
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
of
the
new
haven.
the
new
haven
has
been
bankrupt
since
1961.
the
bonds
have
been
in
default,
$77
million
is
the
approximate
principal
amount,
$98
million
that
are
claimed
today.
these
are
bonds
that
were
issued
in
1947
with
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
last
three
organization
of
the
new
haven.
they
were
issued
along
with
about
over
$200
million
of
income
bonds,
preferred
stock,
common
stock
that
were
supposed
to
be
comparatively
the
risk
securities.
divisional
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
then
who
had
bonds
with
longer,
with
their
higher
interest
rates
and
shorter
maturities
were
required
to
take
these
first
mortgage
bonds
that
would
--
of
such
high
quality,
marketability,
coverage
of
interest,
and
everything
else.
well,
they
went
into
default
1961.
the
trustees
who
are
appointed
in
the
reorganization
intervened
in
the
penn-central
merger
proceedings
in
1962.
they
sought
a
complete
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
in
the
merged
penn-central
to
be
required
by
the
commission
as
a
condition
precedent
to
consummation
of
the
merger.
the
position
of
the
penn-central
at
that
time
were
opposed
that
they
suggested
an
operating
agreement,
they
would
take
in
the
operations
of
the
penn-central
for
a
period
of
--
by
10
years
was
suggested.
the
idea
was
that
they
could
realize
the
same
savings
of
about
$5,200,000
a
year
that
the
trustees
had
shown
would
result
from
inclusion
of
the
operations
by
a
complete
transfer
of
the
properties.
well,
after
those
briefs
have
been
filed,
they
came
to
agreement,
the
new
haven
trustees
and
the
penn-central
management.
they
agreed
to
a
sale
of
all
the
new
haven
properties
to
the
penn-central.
the
trustees
would
try
to
abandon
the
passenger
operations.
the
--
they
would
receive
some
day
a
price
which
penn-cetral
was
willing
to
pay.
in
return,
the
trustees
themselves
would
use
their
best
efforts
as
trustees
to
see
that
the
proposed
price
was
approved
by
the
commission
and
the
reorganization
court
was
consummated.
and
the
new
haven
trustees
also
have
made
the
specific
agreement
to
limit
any
statements
they
might
make
in
the
merger
proceedings,
any
documents
they
might
file
even
in
the
merger
proceedings
or
in
review
proceedings
such
as
this,
so
that
their
statements
and
their
filings
would
be
consistent
with
the
provisions
and
intent
of
that
agreement.
that
agreement
has
created
some
very
substantial
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
commitments
of
the
trustees
to
penn
and
central
and
the
interest
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
fiduciaries.
the
commission
came
to
its
first
decisions
in
april
of
1966.
and
the
new
haven
abandonment
of
passenger
service
case,
they
denied
the
right
to
abandon
most
of
the
passenger
trains.
in
the
penn-central
merger
case,
they
approved
the
merger
of
penn
and
central
subject
to
certain
conditions
affecting
various
railroads.
as
far
as
the
new
haven
was
concerned,
the
commission
made
the
specific
finding
that
without
complete
inclusion
of
the
new
haven,
the
penn-central
merger
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
that
finding
made
in
april
of
1966
was
repeated
again
in
the
november
1967
report.
the
condition
however
that
the
commission
required
was
not
the
inclusion,
actual
inclusion.
it
was
a
commitment
of
penn-central
to
include
the
new
haven
operation
someday
on
terms
to
be
approved
or
proposed
by
the
commission.
until
after
the
entry
of
the
order
of
the
court
below
until
after
this
appeal
--
these
appeals
have
been
docketed,
the
commission
had
never
dealt
on
the
merits
with
the
position
of
gruss
that
there
cannot
be
any
reasonable
assurance
of
actual
inclusion
or
any
actual
inclusion
on
fair
and
reasonable
terms
unless
the
operations
of
the
new
haven
are
taken
over
concurrently
with
consummation
of
the
merger
of
penn
and
central.
now,
its
--
this
is
a
very
important
difference.
it's
one
thing
to
keep
the
new
haven
alive
by
loans
as
far
as
the
constitutional
rights
of
bondholders
are
concerned,
this
means
a
continued
erosion
and
eating
up
of
their
property.
on
the
basis
of
the
november
1967
report
of
the
commission,
the
entire
price
that
would
be
paid
by
penn
and
central,
the
commission
approved
where
penn
and
central
was
willing
to
pay,
would
give
the
new
haven
trustees
for
the
first
mortgage
bondholders,
either
$50
million
if
you
can
value
the
pennsylvania
railroad
stock
at
the
speculative
price
that's
fixed
by
the
commission
of
8750
a
share
or
on
present
market
value,
you've
got
$20
million
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds.
let's
assume
that
you
have
an
immediate
inclusion
today
or
as
of
august
31,
1967.
with
everyday
that
passes,
every
month,
every
year,
the
--
what's
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
is
less
and
less.
it's
eroded
in
two
ways.
one
is
just
by
the
operations,
the
new
haven
trustees
don't
pay
all
--
don't
pay
any
taxes
really.
they
keep
accumulating.
they
don't
pay
rentals,
most
of
their
rentals
for
railroad
cars
and
their
other
administration
expenses
that
reflect
the
erosion
of
basic
position
in
a
decline
of
assets
that
are
leftover
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds,
a
deprivation
of
property
that
the
extent
that
it
isn't
absolutely
necessary
as
utterly
without
due
process
of
law.
and
secondly,
you
have
the
enhancement
of
that
deprivation
of
property
both
by
the
refusal
to
prevent
abandonment
of
passenger
service
and
now
by
the
refusal
to
provide
for
inclusion
at
the
time
you
consummate
the
merger.
there
are
a
number
of
areas
of
specific
constitutional
rights
that
the
commission
in
the
court
below
just
completely
disregard.
one
is
the
right
under
decisions
of
this
court,
railroad
commission
of
texas
against
east
texas
at
what
--
one
of
them
--
the
right
to
--
the
owners
of
a
railroad
property
if
they
cannot
operate
it
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
return,
they
have
a
right
to
abandon
operations
and
to
take
the
salvage
value
that
they
have.
this
is
a
right
which
the
commission
is
prohibiting
in
the
name
of
the
public
interest
in
keeping
the
new
haven
alive.
these
are
loss
operations
which
the
commission
recognizes,
will
continue
to
be
loss
operations
as
long
as
they
kept
separate
for
penn
and
central.
this
right
to
stop
the
losses
and
take
the
salvage
value
is
a
vital
right
which
is
being
denied
that
--
of
the
first
mortgage
bondholders.
the
second
right
is
the
one
involved
with
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
st.
joe
paper
case.
before
you
can
have
properly
a
bankrupt
railroad
included
in
another
railroad,
you
have
to
give
the
owners
of
the
equity,
the
bondholders
in
this
case,
the
right
to
vote
on
the
inclusion.
this
has
attempt
to
force
inclusion
without
giving
bondholders
anything
to
say
about
it,
without
letting
the
bondholders
as
security
holders
know
what
is
in
store
for
them
if
the
commission
price
is
approved.
and
finally,
you
get
the
general
attempt
to
force
a
transaction
which
will
leave
bondholders
with
far
less
than
the
amount
of
their
claim,
again,
without
a
vote
in
violation
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
radford
case
and
the
requirement
of
a
balancing
of
public
and
private
equities
in
the
denver
&
rio
grande
case.
once
this
merger
is
consummated
with
the
erosion
of
the
new
haven
continuing,
there
will
be
no
more
power
either
in
the
commission
or
in
the
courts
to
protect
the
property
rights
of
bondholders.
the
bondholders
are
in
a
position
of
seeing
their
property
disappearing
no
matter
who
contests
what
is
done
by
the
commission
and
the
courts.
if
you
assume
the
current
price
which
cuts
out
all
junior
bonds,
which
cuts
out
all
of
creditors
other
than
bondholders,
you're
going
to
have
litigation
by
those
classes
regardless
of
what
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
do
and
during
that
litigation
every
month
and
every
year
it
goes
on,
you
have
a
decline
in
the
property
that
is
left
for
the
first
mortgage
bonds,
an
erosion
of
their
property.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
the
courts
responding
to
the
appeals
from
the
commission
order
and
requiring
an
increase
in
price,
then
the
same
erosion
can
be
had
at
the
option
of
penn-central.
they
can
litigate
forever
while
the
bondholders
bear
the
cost,
while
the
property
of
the
new
haven
disappears.
and
there
is
no
way
of
compelling
them
to
stop
or
compelling
the
losses
to
stop
except
by
having
the
commission
do
what
its
public
interest
findings
require
it
to
do.
to
have
the
new
haven
included
when
you
have
penn
and
central
merged.
it
is
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
wholly
feasible
to
do
that.
yes.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
if
you
had
a
final
solution
by
lease,
that
would
--
there
would
be
some
either
acceptance
by
new
haven
or
crammed
down
by
the
courts.
i
think
the
dilemma
would
be
satisfied
in
this
--
or
avoided
in
this
situation
if
you
have
inclusion
on
an
interim
basis
now.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
start
with
inclusion
--
by
a
lease
if
you
will,
by
a
lease
with
the
term
--
with
the
read
terms
to
be
fixed
later,
by
a
conveyance
with
the
price
to
be
fixed
later,
by
an
operating
agreement
with
--
that
as
long
as
you
have
the
immediate
takeover
of
the
operations
by
the
penn
and
--
by
the
merged
penn-central,
it's
my
judgment
that
you
could
leave
the
fixing
of
terms
to
a
later
process.
you
would've
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
stopped
the
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
i
don't
--
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
--
and
nobody
would
be
at
anybody's
mercy
at
that
point.
the
--
everybody
would
have
the
right
to
argue
about
terms
if
penn-central
were
so
advised.
they
are
not
blocked
from
arguing
that
the
losses
that
are
--
they
incur
--
if
they
incur
any
losses
should
be
subtracted
from
the
price.
they're
not
stopped
from
arguing
anything
that
they
maybe
advised
to
argue
by
the
fact
of
immediate
inclusion.
the
bondholders
are
in
an
entirely
different
situation.
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
people
on
both
sides
of
them.
the
junior
securities
of
the
--
the
junior
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
and
the
other
creditors
of
the
new
haven
under
one
hand
and
penn-central
on
the
other,
they
are
boxed
in
and
squeezed
and
unable
to
have
court
attention,
court
review
that
is
meaningful
of
their
claim
of
right.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
they've
no
power
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
s.
isaacs
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
could
hope
to
have
power
equivalent
to
that
at
penn-central,
we
can't
and
don't.
but
we
should
have
the
limited
power
not
to
be
boxed
in,
in
a
situation
where
we
have
no
control
over
the
continued
desperate
erosion
of
our
equity.
the
bondholders
are
in
a
unique
--
that
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
are
in
the
unique
position
here
of
having
people
who
--
to
whom
further
erosion
means
nothing,
able
to
litigate
and
expose
the
errors
of
the
commission.
on
the
one
hand,
and
if
they
are
correct
in
having
the
penn-central
able
to
do
it
and
no
matter
who's
doing
it,
this
erosion
continues
indefinitely
under
the
commission
decisions.
it
is
an
erosion
which
practically
can
be
stopped.
the
commission
can
see
that
the
word,
the
findings
of
the
commission
are
upheld,
that
are
matched
by
actual
transactions
if
you
have
inclusion
taking
place
at
the
time
of
the
merger
granted
that
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
of
the
inclusion
being
something
less
than
permanent.
it
still
--
there
still
will
have
been
inclusion
and
the
chances
are
that
it
will
be
permanent
that
the
claims
of
right
will
be
finally
resolved
without
the
kind
of
hammer
that's
over
the
head
of
the
bondholders
today.
i
don't
think
that
the
dilemma
is
realistically
a
serious
one
but
the
dilemma
of
the
bondholders
is
really
an
impossible.
it
is
not
only
the
bondholders
it's
also
the
reorganization
court.
the
court
on
july
--
in
its
july
11
opinion,
requested
bondholders
to
apply
to
the
commission
for
immediate
inclusion
by
way
of
a
lease
so
that
at
the
time
of
merger
you
would
have
a
cessation
of
the
drainage
away
of
the
estate.
the
request
was
made
by
its
order
of
august
1,
the
commission
seemed
to
be
saying
until
the
court
below
that
it
was
saying
that
it
has
set
up
a
machinery
for
the
operations
of
the
new
haven
to
be
included
as
soon
as
the
merger
takes
place.
that
machinery
has
now
been
abandoned.
the
commission
hadn't
decided
completely
apparently
whether
to
abandon
at
the
time
the
court
made
its
decision,
the
court
took
the
intentions
of
the
commission
as
a
substitute
for
action
by
the
commission
to
see
that
the
inclusion
takes
place.
at
this
point,
by
the
november
order,
the
commission
has
abandoned
and
has
left
the
bondholders
and
the
court
in
an
impossible
debate,
nobody
controls
penn-central.
and
once,
except
the
commission,
the
penn-central
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceeding
before
the
reorganization
court.
and
unless
this
court
acts,
it
will
be
impossible
to
have
inclusion
at
anytime
on
any
kind
of
fair
and
reasonable
terms.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
the
time
allotted
for
rebuttal
by
mr.
migdal.
