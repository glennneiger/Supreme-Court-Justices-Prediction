mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
no
one
questions
that
there
is
no
solution
for
the
new
haven
except
its
inclusion
in
a
penn-central
system.
there
is
no
other
way
that
anyone
has
proposed
whereby
it
could
survive.
no
one
questions
that
the
new
haven's
operations
are
essential
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission
has
found
that
now
again
and
again.
the
problem
faced
by
the
trustees
therefore
this
time
is,
how
can
the
new
haven
survive
until
it
is
physically
included
in
a
penn-central
system?
this
is
a
problem,
which
up
until
a
matter
of
two
weeks
ago
had
no
answer.
at
that
time,
the
commission
provided
an
answer
by
a
supplemental
order
and
a
report
dated
november
16
which
was
the
culmination
of
proceedings
that
have
been
in
progress
ever
since
this
court's
consideration
of
these
proceedings
a
year
ago.
the
commission
provided
two
things.
first,
they
said
that
upon
merger,
penn-central
would
be
required
to
participate
in
new
haven's
operating
losses
for
a
three-year
period
upon
a
formula
which
had
as
its
maximum,
it
cost
penn-central
of
$5.5
million
a
year.
second,
that
until
such
time
as
new
haven
could
be
physically
included,
penn-central
would
be
required
as
a
merged
company
to
be
the
banker
of
the
new
haven
up
to
$25
million
and
up
to
three
years
in
duration.
now,
these
two
techniques
provide
the
means
for
preserving
the
new
haven
if
you
have
a
penn-central
merger.
the
first
that
is
to
say,
the
sharing
of
losses
for
the
first
time
permits
the
creditors
of
the
new
haven
to
have
someone
else
bear
the
burden
of
the
erosion
of
the
estate
that
occurs
apart
from
the
cash
aspects
of
its
operations.
the
new
haven
has
been
operating
on
a
cash
basis
now
since
1961
when
the
reorganization
started.
but
while
its
income
statement
sets
out
one
set
of
figures,
its
cash
is
a
problem
of
merely
meeting
payrolls
no
matter
how
much
erosion
occurs
as
you
continue
to
operate
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
this
sharing
by
penn-central
however,
will
take
part
of
the
burden
off
the
back
of
the
creditors
while
this
s
kept
alive
in
the
public
interest
until
it
has
been
physically
included
in
penn-central.
the
second
problem
as
i
indicated
which
is
a
cash
problem
is
alleviated
because
that
is
the
amount
of
cash
which
is
deemed,
would
keep
the
new
haven
alive
for
the
next
three
years.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
are
some
administrative
work
that
remains
to
be
done
mr.
justice
brennan.
under
the
commission's
order,
the
penn
and
central
people
and
the
trustees
are
required
to
file
in
35
days
the
documents
which
will
carry
out
the
commission's
views.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
bondholders,
some
of
them
have
appeared
here
today
are
going
to
appeal
whatever
happens
in
this
instance.
we
don't
question
that.
and
we
say
before
this
court,
the
issue
that
you
must
consider
is
--
are
those
appeals
such
as
to
go
to
fundamentals
of
the
preservation
of
the
new
haven
or
are
they
appeals
as
to
which
effective
judicial
review
will
exist
to
protect
our
bondholders.
now
the
position
which
we
would
take
before
the
court
is,
and
i
will
go
into
these
issues
in
some
detail,
that
no
matter
what
can
happen
here,
there
is
effective
judicial
review
and
there
is
protection
for
all
bondholders.
now,
before
i
get
into
the
specifics
of
that,
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
that
only
one
of
our
bondholders
in
terms
of
right
has
appeared
here,
our
first
mortgage
bondholders.
we
have
two
other
series.
we
have
a
series
which
constitutes
a
divisional
lien
on
some
of
our
most
valuable
property.
and
that's
senior
to
our
first
mortgage,
that's
known
as
the
harlem
river
division
bonds.
and
we
have
a
bond
issue
that's
junior
to
our
first
mortgage
known
as
the
general
income
bonds
which
has
in
effect
a
second
mortgage.
now
we
have
a
reorganization
plan
going
at
this
time
to
which
there
has
been
some
reference
in
the
briefs
of
the
bondholder
groups
here
as
to
which
hearings
have
been
completed.
in
that
reorganization
plan,
the
trustees
have
proposed
to
the
commission
that
the
junior
equity
in
this
estate
is
not
the
first
mortgage,
but
the
general
income
bonds,
and
that
speed
is
essential
in
carrying
out
inclusion
of
the
new
haven,
or
that
some
method
is
required
to
have
a
sharing
of
losses
pending
that
inclusion
in
order
not
to
prejudice
the
most
junior
equity.
not
to
be
sure,
the
trustees
can
be
wrong
on
that.
i
don't
need
to
argue
here
if
the
trustees
plan
is
correct
or
not.
that's
something
that's
just
now
being
submitted
to
the
commission
on
briefs.
but
the
significant
thing
is,
is
it
possible
to
protect
those
rights?
is
it
possible
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
first
mortgage?
and
of
the
harlem
river
mortgage
and
of
any
other
party
to
this
proceeding
while
penn-central
is
being
consummated
so
as
to
give
the
new
haven
the
benefit
of
this
special
relief
which
penn-central
has
agreed
to
go
through
with
in
its
brief
before
this
court.
we
submit
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
merger
sir
and
the
filing
of
the
documents
which
are
due
on
december
26.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
current
estimates,
those
are
referenced
here
today
by
mr.
macdougall
is
that
we
will
not
have
more
than
$2
million
of
cash
by
december
31
of
this
year,
our
payroll
and
materials
and
supplies
cost
which
are
basic
barebones
cost
are
a
$1,750,000
a
week.
the
first
week
in
january,
we
have
equipment
obligations
and
equipment
obligations
are
protected
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
so
that
we
must
say
to
the
court
this
time
that
the
first
week
in
january
is
when
we
ran
out.
the
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
are
four
types
of
issues
which
the
bondholders
can
raise
as
to
which
we
say
there
is
effective
judicial
protection
no
matter
whether
you
--
that
if
you
permit
the
penn-central
merger
to
go
ahead.
the
first
is,
what
is
the
value
of
the
new
haven's
estate
that
cannot
be
effectively
reviewed
and
can
they
have
the
benefit
of
judicial
sanction
or
judicial
mandate
of
a
figure
other
than
that
found
by
the
commission.
well,
the
commission
on
november
16
has
already
found
evaluation.
that
is
now
in
existence,
they
filed
a
vote
for
purposes
of
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
at
the
purposes
of
section
77.
under
5
(2)
they
must
find
fair
inevitable
--
fair
terms
and
under
section
77,
they
must
find
fair
and
equitable
terms.
under
section
77,
they're
charged
with
the
function
of
valuing
the
railroad.
they've
done
it.
now,
what
happens
if
the
bondholders
appeal
that
valuation
and
i
will
assume
they
will
just
of
the
very
essence
of
the
commission's
findings
of
value.
what
happens
whenever
the
commission
finds
a
value
in
section
5
(2)?
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
don't
really
know
how
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying
we're
blackmailing
everyone
in
the
east
including
this
court.
at
this
point
in
time,
we
filed
a
report
with
the
reorganization
court
which
its
trustees
we
felt
obliged
to
do.
that
report
was
filed
a
week
ago
and
at
that
time,
we
thought
we
had
$500,000
of
department
of
transportation
money.
we
now
find
we're
not
going
to
have
that.
in
the
meantime,
we've
talked
to
the
state
of
connecticut
and
we've
asked
them
if
they
would
stand
biased.
the
state
of
connecticut
in
particular
because
they
have
a
department
of
transportation
and
hence
the
constitutional
and
legal
issues
that
may
arise
with
new
york
or
massachusetts
or
rhode
island
may
not
exist
in
the
case
of
connecticut.
they've
indicated
to
us,
they'll
do
everything
they
can.
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
it
mr.
justice
brennan
except
to
say
that
at
this
moment
in
time,
we
have
no
source.
now,
it's
true
that
the
states
in
the
past
and
the
current
--
in
current
years
have
helped
us
in
an
extent
6
million
odd
dollars
a
year.
if
connecticut
has
the
legal
power
to
give
us
some
money
during
the
first
week
in
january
to
tie
these
all
whether
this
court
acts,
of
course
we're
going
to
take
it.
our
other
source,
our
only
other
source
is
this.
in
the
registry
of
the
court
as
a
consequence
of
sales
of
property,
there
is
some
$7
million.
the
court
in
the
past
has
indicated
and
this
of
course
is
subject
to
the
lien
of
the
bondholders
because
it
was
their
property
that
was
sold.
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
that
it
would
not
receive
favorably
attempts
by
the
trustees
who
indicated
to
the
court
that
they
might
be
forced
to
do
this,
to
have
a
release
of
those
funds
for
operating
purposes.
i
can
assure
this
court
however
that
it
--
at
last
resort,
the
trustees
will
go
back
to
the
reorganization
court
to
attempt
to
get
a
release
of
so
much
of
those
moneys
as
we
keep
this
road
going
until
this
court
has
acted.
but
we
have
no
assurance
in
that
respect
either.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
justice
black,
this
year,
we're
estimating
that
it
will
have
a
deficit
in
net
railway
operating
income
of
$20
million.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
we
have
very
close
relationships
from
an
operating
point
of
view
with
both
of
these
railroads.
for
example,
grand
central
terminal
in
new
york
is
shared
by
the
new
york
central
and
the
new
haven
railroads.
they
share
the
expenses,
their
car
inferences
which
were
in
the
ratio
of
approximately
55
to
45,
the
basis
for
the
allocation
of
expenses
and
income
from
the
so-called
park
avenue
real
estate
properties.
we
share
pennsylvania
station
with
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
we
own
a
railroad
called
new
york
connecting,
which
has
as
its
only
function
to
link
up
the
new
haven
and
the
pennsylvania.
we
own
that
50/50
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
we
share
stations
with
the
new
haven
--
with
the
new
york
central
at
springfield
and
worcester
and
boston
at
south
station
and
back
bay
station.
we're
the
--
we're
almost
a
bridge
between
those
two
railroads
today.
now
all
the
estimates
and
there
have
been
several
expert
presentations
in
this
respect
including
that
of
the
penn-central,
our
own,
and
some
of
our
bondholders
are
that
new
haven
as
part
of
penn-central
can
save
over
$5
million
a
year
in
operating
cost.
so
to
that
extent
mr.
justice
black,
the
deficit
is
reduced.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
this
year
which
is
a
extraordinarily
bad
year,
we
estimate
a
deficit
in
net
railway
operating
income
of
$20
million.
however,
last
year,
it
was
less
than
half
of
that
amount.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
these
operations
will
be
penn-central
operations
and
they
will
have
to
conduct
our
operations.
commission
has
said,
both
passenger
and
freight.
so
that
the
--
to
the
extent
that
one
could
subsequently
define
those
losses
or
pick
them
out,
they
will
be
penn-central
losses.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
other
railroads
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
will
take
money
away
from
the
stockholders
of
penn
and
central.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
it
will
be
just
an
integral
part
of
their
operations
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
the
--
i
started
to
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
--
there
were
certain
fundamental
issues
as
to
which
we
felt
there
was
effective
judicial
review.
one
was
the
amount
of
the
total
value
of
the
new
haven
as
to
which
findings
have
already
been
made.
if
that
on
appeal
should
be
reversed,
should
be
remanded,
should
be
increased,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
change
it.
second,
the
amount
of
this
interim
sharing
by
penn-central
during
the
period
between
new
haven's
--
between
the
date
of
merger
and
new
haven's
inclusion
of
that
merger,
penn-central's
brief
before
the
court
says
they
recognize
they
could
be
charged
with
a
greater
proportion
if
the
bondholders
on
appeal
convinced
the
court
that
the
commission
treated
them
too
lightly.
these
are
--
these
go
to
quantum
of
consideration.
all
of
these
and
they're
other
questions
of
quantum
of
consideration.
the
trustees
believe
that
all
of
these
have
effective
judicial
review
available
as
a
remedy.
we
find
nothing
and
anything
our
bondholder
say
including
the
technique
of
the
loans
as
presenting
a
problem
if
penn-central
should
merge
and
thereafter
the
commission
has
to
change
these
terms.
the
commission
has
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction
and
it
has
specific
recognition
by
penn-central
as
to
quantum
in
their
brief.
the
only
remaining
thing
is,
our
bondholder
say,
there
are
to
be
traffic
protection
as
well,
all
are
appendix
g
in
the
case
of
d
&
h
and
erie-lackawanna
and
b
&
m.
the
commission
has
denied
that,
but
even
in
denying
it
have
said
that
they've
got
authority
to
compensate
for
it
as
part
of
the
quantum
of
consideration.
accordingly,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
whatever
maybe
the
rights
of
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven,
and
of
course
this
is
not
a
forum
to
determine
those
rights
at
this
time,
whatever
maybe
those
rights,
there
is
adequate
judicial
sanction
which
would
permit
the
court
to
make
such
changes
as
might
be
deemed
necessary
if
the
commission
is
in
error.
if
the
commission
is
not
in
error,
however,
and
the
court
now
enters
a
stay
based
on
these
arguments
of
our
bondholders,
we
have
the
anomaly
of
frustrating
the
very
objective
which
they
presumably
would
seek
with
us,
that
is
to
preserve
the
new
haven.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
no
one
questions
that
there
is
no
solution
for
the
new
haven
except
its
inclusion
in
a
penn-central
system.
there
is
no
other
way
that
anyone
has
proposed
whereby
it
could
survive.
no
one
questions
that
the
new
haven's
operations
are
essential
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission
has
found
that
now
again
and
again.
the
problem
faced
by
the
trustees
therefore
this
time
is,
how
can
the
new
haven
survive
until
it
is
physically
included
in
a
penn-central
system?
this
is
a
problem,
which
up
until
a
matter
of
two
weeks
ago
had
no
answer.
at
that
time,
the
commission
provided
an
answer
by
a
supplemental
order
and
a
report
dated
november
16
which
was
the
culmination
of
proceedings
that
have
been
in
progress
ever
since
this
court's
consideration
of
these
proceedings
a
year
ago.
the
commission
provided
two
things.
first,
they
said
that
upon
merger,
penn-central
would
be
required
to
participate
in
new
haven's
operating
losses
for
a
three-year
period
upon
a
formula
which
had
as
its
maximum,
it
cost
penn-central
of
$5.5
million
a
year.
second,
that
until
such
time
as
new
haven
could
be
physically
included,
penn-central
would
be
required
as
a
merged
company
to
be
the
banker
of
the
new
haven
up
to
$25
million
and
up
to
three
years
in
duration.
now,
these
two
techniques
provide
the
means
for
preserving
the
new
haven
if
you
have
a
penn-central
merger.
the
first
that
is
to
say,
the
sharing
of
losses
for
the
first
time
permits
the
creditors
of
the
new
haven
to
have
someone
else
bear
the
burden
of
the
erosion
of
the
estate
that
occurs
apart
from
the
cash
aspects
of
its
operations.
the
new
haven
has
been
operating
on
a
cash
basis
now
since
1961
when
the
reorganization
started.
but
while
its
income
statement
sets
out
one
set
of
figures,
its
cash
is
a
problem
of
merely
meeting
payrolls
no
matter
how
much
erosion
occurs
as
you
continue
to
operate
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
this
sharing
by
penn-central
however,
will
take
part
of
the
burden
off
the
back
of
the
creditors
while
this
s
kept
alive
in
the
public
interest
until
it
has
been
physically
included
in
penn-central.
the
second
problem
as
i
indicated
which
is
a
cash
problem
is
alleviated
because
that
is
the
amount
of
cash
which
is
deemed,
would
keep
the
new
haven
alive
for
the
next
three
years.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
are
some
administrative
work
that
remains
to
be
done
mr.
justice
brennan.
under
the
commission's
order,
the
penn
and
central
people
and
the
trustees
are
required
to
file
in
35
days
the
documents
which
will
carry
out
the
commission's
views.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
bondholders,
some
of
them
have
appeared
here
today
are
going
to
appeal
whatever
happens
in
this
instance.
we
don't
question
that.
and
we
say
before
this
court,
the
issue
that
you
must
consider
is
--
are
those
appeals
such
as
to
go
to
fundamentals
of
the
preservation
of
the
new
haven
or
are
they
appeals
as
to
which
effective
judicial
review
will
exist
to
protect
our
bondholders.
now
the
position
which
we
would
take
before
the
court
is,
and
i
will
go
into
these
issues
in
some
detail,
that
no
matter
what
can
happen
here,
there
is
effective
judicial
review
and
there
is
protection
for
all
bondholders.
now,
before
i
get
into
the
specifics
of
that,
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
that
only
one
of
our
bondholders
in
terms
of
right
has
appeared
here,
our
first
mortgage
bondholders.
we
have
two
other
series.
we
have
a
series
which
constitutes
a
divisional
lien
on
some
of
our
most
valuable
property.
and
that's
senior
to
our
first
mortgage,
that's
known
as
the
harlem
river
division
bonds.
and
we
have
a
bond
issue
that's
junior
to
our
first
mortgage
known
as
the
general
income
bonds
which
has
in
effect
a
second
mortgage.
now
we
have
a
reorganization
plan
going
at
this
time
to
which
there
has
been
some
reference
in
the
briefs
of
the
bondholder
groups
here
as
to
which
hearings
have
been
completed.
in
that
reorganization
plan,
the
trustees
have
proposed
to
the
commission
that
the
junior
equity
in
this
estate
is
not
the
first
mortgage,
but
the
general
income
bonds,
and
that
speed
is
essential
in
carrying
out
inclusion
of
the
new
haven,
or
that
some
method
is
required
to
have
a
sharing
of
losses
pending
that
inclusion
in
order
not
to
prejudice
the
most
junior
equity.
not
to
be
sure,
the
trustees
can
be
wrong
on
that.
i
don't
need
to
argue
here
if
the
trustees
plan
is
correct
or
not.
that's
something
that's
just
now
being
submitted
to
the
commission
on
briefs.
but
the
significant
thing
is,
is
it
possible
to
protect
those
rights?
is
it
possible
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
first
mortgage?
and
of
the
harlem
river
mortgage
and
of
any
other
party
to
this
proceeding
while
penn-central
is
being
consummated
so
as
to
give
the
new
haven
the
benefit
of
this
special
relief
which
penn-central
has
agreed
to
go
through
with
in
its
brief
before
this
court.
we
submit
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
merger
sir
and
the
filing
of
the
documents
which
are
due
on
december
26.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
current
estimates,
those
are
referenced
here
today
by
mr.
macdougall
is
that
we
will
not
have
more
than
$2
million
of
cash
by
december
31
of
this
year,
our
payroll
and
materials
and
supplies
cost
which
are
basic
barebones
cost
are
a
$1,750,000
a
week.
the
first
week
in
january,
we
have
equipment
obligations
and
equipment
obligations
are
protected
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
so
that
we
must
say
to
the
court
this
time
that
the
first
week
in
january
is
when
we
ran
out.
the
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
there
are
four
types
of
issues
which
the
bondholders
can
raise
as
to
which
we
say
there
is
effective
judicial
protection
no
matter
whether
you
--
that
if
you
permit
the
penn-central
merger
to
go
ahead.
the
first
is,
what
is
the
value
of
the
new
haven's
estate
that
cannot
be
effectively
reviewed
and
can
they
have
the
benefit
of
judicial
sanction
or
judicial
mandate
of
a
figure
other
than
that
found
by
the
commission.
well,
the
commission
on
november
16
has
already
found
evaluation.
that
is
now
in
existence,
they
filed
a
vote
for
purposes
of
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
at
the
purposes
of
section
77.
under
5
(2)
they
must
find
fair
inevitable
--
fair
terms
and
under
section
77,
they
must
find
fair
and
equitable
terms.
under
section
77,
they're
charged
with
the
function
of
valuing
the
railroad.
they've
done
it.
now,
what
happens
if
the
bondholders
appeal
that
valuation
and
i
will
assume
they
will
just
of
the
very
essence
of
the
commission's
findings
of
value.
what
happens
whenever
the
commission
finds
a
value
in
section
5
(2)?
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
don't
really
know
how
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying
we're
blackmailing
everyone
in
the
east
including
this
court.
at
this
point
in
time,
we
filed
a
report
with
the
reorganization
court
which
its
trustees
we
felt
obliged
to
do.
that
report
was
filed
a
week
ago
and
at
that
time,
we
thought
we
had
$500,000
of
department
of
transportation
money.
we
now
find
we're
not
going
to
have
that.
in
the
meantime,
we've
talked
to
the
state
of
connecticut
and
we've
asked
them
if
they
would
stand
biased.
the
state
of
connecticut
in
particular
because
they
have
a
department
of
transportation
and
hence
the
constitutional
and
legal
issues
that
may
arise
with
new
york
or
massachusetts
or
rhode
island
may
not
exist
in
the
case
of
connecticut.
they've
indicated
to
us,
they'll
do
everything
they
can.
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
it
mr.
justice
brennan
except
to
say
that
at
this
moment
in
time,
we
have
no
source.
now,
it's
true
that
the
states
in
the
past
and
the
current
--
in
current
years
have
helped
us
in
an
extent
6
million
odd
dollars
a
year.
if
connecticut
has
the
legal
power
to
give
us
some
money
during
the
first
week
in
january
to
tie
these
all
whether
this
court
acts,
of
course
we're
going
to
take
it.
our
other
source,
our
only
other
source
is
this.
in
the
registry
of
the
court
as
a
consequence
of
sales
of
property,
there
is
some
$7
million.
the
court
in
the
past
has
indicated
and
this
of
course
is
subject
to
the
lien
of
the
bondholders
because
it
was
their
property
that
was
sold.
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
that
it
would
not
receive
favorably
attempts
by
the
trustees
who
indicated
to
the
court
that
they
might
be
forced
to
do
this,
to
have
a
release
of
those
funds
for
operating
purposes.
i
can
assure
this
court
however
that
it
--
at
last
resort,
the
trustees
will
go
back
to
the
reorganization
court
to
attempt
to
get
a
release
of
so
much
of
those
moneys
as
we
keep
this
road
going
until
this
court
has
acted.
but
we
have
no
assurance
in
that
respect
either.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
justice
black,
this
year,
we're
estimating
that
it
will
have
a
deficit
in
net
railway
operating
income
of
$20
million.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
we
have
very
close
relationships
from
an
operating
point
of
view
with
both
of
these
railroads.
for
example,
grand
central
terminal
in
new
york
is
shared
by
the
new
york
central
and
the
new
haven
railroads.
they
share
the
expenses,
their
car
inferences
which
were
in
the
ratio
of
approximately
55
to
45,
the
basis
for
the
allocation
of
expenses
and
income
from
the
so-called
park
avenue
real
estate
properties.
we
share
pennsylvania
station
with
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
we
own
a
railroad
called
new
york
connecting,
which
has
as
its
only
function
to
link
up
the
new
haven
and
the
pennsylvania.
we
own
that
50/50
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
we
share
stations
with
the
new
haven
--
with
the
new
york
central
at
springfield
and
worcester
and
boston
at
south
station
and
back
bay
station.
we're
the
--
we're
almost
a
bridge
between
those
two
railroads
today.
now
all
the
estimates
and
there
have
been
several
expert
presentations
in
this
respect
including
that
of
the
penn-central,
our
own,
and
some
of
our
bondholders
are
that
new
haven
as
part
of
penn-central
can
save
over
$5
million
a
year
in
operating
cost.
so
to
that
extent
mr.
justice
black,
the
deficit
is
reduced.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
this
year
which
is
a
extraordinarily
bad
year,
we
estimate
a
deficit
in
net
railway
operating
income
of
$20
million.
however,
last
year,
it
was
less
than
half
of
that
amount.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
these
operations
will
be
penn-central
operations
and
they
will
have
to
conduct
our
operations.
commission
has
said,
both
passenger
and
freight.
so
that
the
--
to
the
extent
that
one
could
subsequently
define
those
losses
or
pick
them
out,
they
will
be
penn-central
losses.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
other
railroads
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
will
take
money
away
from
the
stockholders
of
penn
and
central.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
it
will
be
just
an
integral
part
of
their
operations
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
the
--
i
started
to
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
--
there
were
certain
fundamental
issues
as
to
which
we
felt
there
was
effective
judicial
review.
one
was
the
amount
of
the
total
value
of
the
new
haven
as
to
which
findings
have
already
been
made.
if
that
on
appeal
should
be
reversed,
should
be
remanded,
should
be
increased,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
change
it.
second,
the
amount
of
this
interim
sharing
by
penn-central
during
the
period
between
new
haven's
--
between
the
date
of
merger
and
new
haven's
inclusion
of
that
merger,
penn-central's
brief
before
the
court
says
they
recognize
they
could
be
charged
with
a
greater
proportion
if
the
bondholders
on
appeal
convinced
the
court
that
the
commission
treated
them
too
lightly.
these
are
--
these
go
to
quantum
of
consideration.
all
of
these
and
they're
other
questions
of
quantum
of
consideration.
the
trustees
believe
that
all
of
these
have
effective
judicial
review
available
as
a
remedy.
we
find
nothing
and
anything
our
bondholder
say
including
the
technique
of
the
loans
as
presenting
a
problem
if
penn-central
should
merge
and
thereafter
the
commission
has
to
change
these
terms.
the
commission
has
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction
and
it
has
specific
recognition
by
penn-central
as
to
quantum
in
their
brief.
the
only
remaining
thing
is,
our
bondholder
say,
there
are
to
be
traffic
protection
as
well,
all
are
appendix
g
in
the
case
of
d
&
h
and
erie-lackawanna
and
b
&
m.
the
commission
has
denied
that,
but
even
in
denying
it
have
said
that
they've
got
authority
to
compensate
for
it
as
part
of
the
quantum
of
consideration.
accordingly,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
whatever
maybe
the
rights
of
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven,
and
of
course
this
is
not
a
forum
to
determine
those
rights
at
this
time,
whatever
maybe
those
rights,
there
is
adequate
judicial
sanction
which
would
permit
the
court
to
make
such
changes
as
might
be
deemed
necessary
if
the
commission
is
in
error.
if
the
commission
is
not
in
error,
however,
and
the
court
now
enters
a
stay
based
on
these
arguments
of
our
bondholders,
we
have
the
anomaly
of
frustrating
the
very
objective
which
they
presumably
would
seek
with
us,
that
is
to
preserve
the
new
haven.
