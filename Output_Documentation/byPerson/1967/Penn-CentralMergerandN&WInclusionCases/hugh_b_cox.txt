mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
this
case
for
the
new
york
central
and
the
pennsylvania.
the
interest
of
my
client
by
the
course
primarily
in
affirmance
of
so
much
of
the
judgment
below
as
it
allows
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
i
propose
in
the
time
that
has
been
allotted
to
me
to
devote
my
attention
primarily
to
the
arguments
of
those
parties
who
are
seeking
to
defer
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
now,
i
am
obliged
to
say
to
the
court
in
candor
that
i
think
most
of
the
arguments
that
can
be
made
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
had
been
touched
upon
in
one
way
or
another.
i
propose
in
general
simply
to
state
our
position
in
summarily
as
i
can
with
reasons
for
it.
and
if
there
are
any
questions
from
the
bench,
i
shall
do
my
best
to
answer
them.
now
the
objections
to
immediate
consummation
come
largely
from
two
groups.
i
say
largely
because
that
hasn't
been
qualified
but
the
two
groups
who
are
largely
objecting
to
immediate
consummation
are
first,
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven,
not
the
bondholders
of
the
erie
represented
by
mr.
fooshee,
but
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven.
and
i
propose
i
think
to
deal
first
with
their
contention.
now
despite
the
complexity
of
their
argument
and
some
of
the
irrelevancies
with
which
i
think
it
is
counting,
i
think
their
basic
position
can
be
stated
quite
simply
and
i
think
answers
them.
their
basic
and
ultimate
position
is
that
this
merger
should
not
be
consummated
until
the
penn-central
agrees
to
absorb
all
of
the
operating
losses
of
the
new
haven
for
the
period
that
must
elapse
between
consummation
of
the
merger
and
the
final
completion
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
actual
physical
and
legal
inclusion
of
new
haven
into
penn-central.
now
they
state
that
in
different
ways,
they
sometimes
describe
it
as
interim
inclusion,
of
course
it
isn't
inclusion
at
all
really.
they
sometimes
talk
about
a
lease
or
about
an
operating
agreement.
but
it
all
comes
back
to
the
proposition
that
the
penn-central
should
absorb
all
of
those
losses
in
this
area.
now
they've
had
a
hearing
on
this
question
before
the
commission
as
mr.
auerback
explained
to
you,
a
hearing
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
case.
and
the
commission
recognized
that
there
should
be
some
arrangement
to
sharing
these
losses.
but
the
commission
declined
to
require
penn-central
to
absorb
all
the
operating
losses
and
it
made
findings
and
stated
reasons
for
that.
it
found
in
the
first
place
that,
of
course
under
any
interim
arrangement
of
this
kind,
penn-central
will
not
have
the
power
of
an
owner.
it
can't
deal
with
and
dispose
the
property
the
way
an
owner
can
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
achieve
the
kind
of
operating
economies
and
efficiencies
that
can
be
expected
after
inclusion.
and
since
its
power
would
be
limited
in
that
way,
the
commission
said
--
thought
that
that
was
a
reason
for
not
requiring
it
assume
all
these
interim
losses.
it's
a
--
i
think
a
reasonable
proposition.
you
don't
have
a
complete
power
to
manage
and
you
shouldn't
have
complete
responsibility
with
the
losses.
but
the
commission
then
went
on
to
a
second
point
which
is
quite
important
and
say
--
pointed
out
that
if
the
penn-central
should
be
required
to
absorb
all
of
these
operating
losses,
the
bankruptcy
law
and
the
bankruptcy
statute
being
what
it
is,
the
litigation
among
the
parties
to
this
bankruptcy
proceeding
could
proceed
endlessly.
they
would
have
no
incentive
to
impose
their
differences
or
to
terminate
that
litigation
because
their
position
would
be
preserved
for
all
this
period
of
time
went
on.
the
penn-central
will
be
paying
the
operating
losses.
the
commission
therefore
found
that
it
--
and
stated
it
in
just
about
these
words
in
this
november
21st
opinion.
it
said
we
think
that
we
can
best
accomplish
our
objective
which
is
prompt
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
into
penn-central
in
that
real
sense.
if
we
require
all
the
interested
parties
to
share
in
these
losses,
that
will
give
everybody
an
incentive
to
compose
the
differences
and
to
litigate
with
expedition
and
get
this
proceeding
terminated.
and
accordingly,
it
provided
for
a
sharing
of
the
losses.
this
whole
arrangement
last
for
three
years
because
that
was
an
estimate
of
the
party
that
what
might
be
required
for
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
commission
applied
the
formula
of
the
operating
losses
to
determine
what
losses
should
be
shared
and
made
an
order
that
required
the
penn-central
to
take
and
absorb
100%
of
the
losses
in
the
first
year,
50%
in
the
second
year
and
25%
in
the
third
year
with
a
ceiling
on
the
total
amount
this
year
to
be
required
and
to
be
sought.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
order
that
the
commission
--
which
the
commission
did
this.
an
order
was
made
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
case
and
the
courts
can
do
--
can
be
and
doubtless
will
be
reviewed
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
usual
way.
and
as
mr.
auerback
points
out
of
course,
upon
that
review,
the
commission
--
the
orders
remanded
to
the
commission,
the
commission
has
to
fix
terms
(inaudible)
owners
on
the
penn-central.
the
penn-central
having
consummated
the
merger
if
it's
allowed
to
do
in
the
meantime
will
be
bound
by
those
conditions
as
a
result
of
the
commission's
original
order.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
are
--
i'm
quite
clear
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
action
in
an
inclusion
case
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time
to
review
and
i
mentioned
it
simply
to
show
that
this
basis
of
which
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
are
asking
to
have
the
penn-central
merger
held
up.
it
is
a
basis
which
has
been
reviewed
by
the
commission
which
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission
and
is
to
which
they
can
get
judicial
review
and
as
to
which
they
will
not
be
prejudiced
if
the
merger
is
allowed
to
be
consummated
as
judge
--
as
the
court
below
held.
that's
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
not
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
rights
--
they
argue
of
great
many
things
but
i
think
they
all
can
be
subsumed
under
the
propositions
i
have
stated
to
you.
now,
i
should
like
to
leave
if
i
may
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
at
that
point
and
start
to
talk
about
the
argument
of
the
norfolk
&
western
which
one
of
their
arguments
which
is
that
even
if
the
inclusion
order
is
affirmed,
the
penn-central
merger
should
not
be
consummated
this
time
because
one
or
another
of
the
three
railroads
are
there
because
of
action
of
their
managements
or
their
stockholders,
principally
the
stockholders
they
speak
of,
will
not
accept
the
terms
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
that
have
been
prescribed
by
that
order.
now
i
really
think
that
i
should
not
--
i
don't
intend
to
spend
much
time
on
that
argument.
i
simply
should
like
to
say
this,
that
as
we
--
i
submit
that
the
responsibility
of
the
commission
under
the
statute
and
under
its
own
findings
in
the
first
case,
and
i
say
under
the
opinion
and
mandate
of
this
court
on
the
previous
people,
are
satisfied
and
completely
satisfied
if
the
commission
gives
each
of
these
railroads
an
opportunity
to
be
included
in
a
major
system
on
the
basis
of
terms
described
to
stare
in
which
you
affirmed
on
judicial
review.
now
if
one
of
these
railroads
or
two
of
them,
the
managements,
the
stockholders
in
pursuit
of
their
private
interest
decide
to
reject
these
terms,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
reason
for
holding
up
this
merger
or
rejecting
the
commission's
findings
that
the
consummation
of
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
i
submit
that
any
other
view
of
the
matter
would
put
the
exercise
of
regulatory
authority
completely
at
the
mercy
of
private
interest.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
really
should,
i
submit,
dispose
of
the
argument
that
is
made
which
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
inclusion
order
will
be
affirmed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
alright,
i
find
--
i
take
this
position
even
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
the
commission,
if
they
decide
that
they
will
not
take
the
opportunity
that
the
commission
has
given
them,
the
commission
can't
force
them
into
a
system
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
and
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
they
should
be
allowed
to
force
the
commission
or
the
courts
for
that
matter
to
hold
up
a
merger
which
is
otherwise
has
been
found
to
be
an
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
--
i
think
the
court
held
that.
but
i
think
the
court
is
not
explicit,
it
is
implicit
in
the
--
what
the
court
held.
what
the
court's
holding
was
directed
to
as
a
public
responsibility
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
suggest
if
i
may,
that
i
do
not
read
the
court's
opinion
of
holding
that
if
the
stockholders
of
one
of
these
roads
for
private
reasons
refused
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
don't
have
the
right
to
stay
independent
in
that
sense,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
or
they
do
so
at
their
own
account.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
do
so.
they
remain
independent,
their
own
peril.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
--
if
they
decide
to
commit
suicide,
the
public
is
deprived
of
their
service.
now
that's
a
harsh
result.
you
don't
have
that
result,
they
can
--
they
control
this.
of
course
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
will
happen,
i
understand.
i'm
putting
this
in
terms
of
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
legal
principles
but
a
notion
that
these
roads
are
going
to
commit
suicide
is
one
that
i
think
the
court
need
to
accept.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
they
have
--
of
course
they
have
a
right
to
stay
independent
which
they
do
so
at
their
own
risk.
if
they
can't
work
out
an
arrangement
if
they
can't
survive,
mr.
silleck
seems
to
think
the
two
of
them
will
survive
even
as
independent.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it's
a
kind
of
--
the
public
interest
in
the
larger
merger
creates
the
situation
where
something
has
to
be
done
with
these
lines
and
the
only
--
the
thing
that
the
commission
can
do
is
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
them
to
become
members
of
a
larger
railroad
system.
i
think
that
seems
to
me
harsh
as
it
is
to
be
a
--
of
the
result
that's
contemplated
by
the
provisions
of
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
right,
precisely
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
a
subject
to
which
i
am
not
in
the
authority
but
i
understand
that
what
the
commission
valued
as
the
commission
fixed
for
including
the
new
haven
in
the
penn-central
was
its
--
what
the
commission
found
to
be
its
actual
liquidation
value
today.
what
it
would
--
what
you
would
get
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
sorry,
i
can't
give
you
the
dollar
figure
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
$125
million,
that's
what
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
--
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
bonds
made
the
securities
maybe
overvalued.
what
the
commission
did
mr.
justice
black
was
to
fix
the
value
on
the
basis
of
what
you
would
get
for
the
property
if
you
sold
it
in
liquidation
today.
they
went
out
of
business,
what
do
they
get
for
it.
now,
i
frankly
have
to
say
that
the
evidence
that
supports
that
determination
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
that
question
of
valuation
isn't
here.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
that
of
course
is
in
part
our
position.
they
can't
necessarily
expect
to
get
the
full
value
of
what
it's
worth
today.
and
--
but
that
again
is
not
a
question
that's
involve
the
case
before
the
court
today,
i
think,
that
will
be
determined
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
the
inclusion
case
which
was
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
what
you're
being
urged
to
do
by
the
new
haven
trustees
mr.
justice
black
is
to
act
promptly
to
save
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
railroad
not
the
stockholders
and
the
bondholders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
the
basis
of
the
findings.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
based
on
the
other,
its
desire
to
preserve
the
transportation
facilities
of
new
haven.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
on
the
basis
of
the
current
market
value
because
i
think
of
the
securities.
i
think
it's
on
the
basis
of
a
liquidations
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
right.
and
the
commission
acted
on
the
first
basis,
not
on
the
second
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
on
the
plan.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
if
the
plan
of
reorganization
goes
through
apart
from
these
--
to
the
consideration
which
will
be
received,
will
be
stuck
in
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
there
are
some
other
considerations
involved
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
quite
correct.
they
will
--
the
deficit
then
will
be
born,
if
there
is
one,
the
operating
deficit
will
be
born
by
the
merged
company.
it
will
be
up
to
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
go
forward
but
then
if
they
didn't
create
the
whole
transaction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
can't
get
out
of
it
if
they
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
if
they
consummate
the
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
the
--
it's
stuck
with
it
in
this
sense
in
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
that
having
consummated
the
merger,
you
have
the
penn-central
--
two
companies
involved
by
that
act,
it
would
be
found
by
any
conditions
that
the
commission
fixed
or
--
originally
or
on
remand
under
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
act
to
be
so
far
as
this
new
haven
situation
is
concerned.
i
now
should
like
to
--
there's
one
other
point
that
i
should
like
to
deal
with
and
that
is
the
argument
which
i
think
can
somewhat
confused
here,
to
what
should
happen
so
far
as
the
merger
is
concerned
in
the
event
that
the
inclusion
order
should
be
found
by
this
court
to
be
effective
in
certain
respects
and
the
inclusion
case
remanded
to
the
commission
for
further
consideration.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
any
infirmity
in
the
inclusion
order.
we
didn't
litigate
the
inclusion
order,
my
clients
didn't
but
either
--
before
the
commission
or
before
the
court,
and
we
have
an
interest
in
it
only
insofar
as
it
affects
the
merger.
but
assuming
that
there
is
some
infirmity
in
the
inclusion
order
and
that
this
court
should
direct
to
remand,
we
submit
that
even
so,
the
penn-central
merger
should
now
be
consummated.
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
that
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
arguments
here
this
morning
as
it
looked
clear
from
the
papers
i
think
of
the
parties
in
this
case
that
what
is
left
in
the
inclusion
case,
and
this
is
true
whether
one
or
two
lines
payout.
what
is
left
in
the
inclusion
case
is
a
dispute
essentially
in
private,
in
character
about
how
much
money
the
n
&
w
should
pay
for
those
lines.
and
we
submit
that
the
merger
itself,
the
penn-central
merger
need
not
and
should
not
be
held
up
even
if
there
is
a
remand
pending
the
resolution
of
that
dispute
over
how
much
money
the
n
&
w
should
pay.
it
is
not
necessary
to
hold
up
the
merger
to
protect
the
three
lines
that
are
involved,
the
three
smaller
railroads
because
they
are
now
protected
by
the
perfected
appendix
g
conditions
and
not
one
of
the
three
railroads
is
challenging
those
conditions
in
this
court.
it
seemed
to
regard
in
these
sets
of
fact.
the
n
&
w
has
not
pointed
in
anyway
which
it
would
be
prejudiced
if
there
is
a
remand
on
how
much
money
it
should
pay
for
the
three
lines
and
in
the
meantime,
these
mergers
consummated.
it
will
still
be
able
to
make
all
of
its
arguments
about
how
much
money
it
should
pay
and
it
can
get
judicial
review
with
those
arguments.
our
definition
in
the
courts
will
not
be
affected
in
anyway
by
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
so
far
as
concerns
what
is
really
the
essential
of
the
question
of
public
interest
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
the
commission
has
decided.
clearly
as
it
can
to
be
decided
in
finding
--
with
these
findings
that
are
imperfect
in
any
respect,
there
the
imperfection
does
not
affect
the
substance
that
these
three
railroads
if
they're
willing
to
go,
belong
so
far
as
concerned
to
public
interest,
in
the
n
&
w.
the
commission
found
that
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
was
preferable
to
inclusion
in
penn-central.
the
commission
found
that
there
was
a
better
chance
of
preserving
their
transportation
facilities
if
they
were
included
in
n
&
w
than
they
would
be
if
they
were
included
in
the
penn-central.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
criticism
of
the
commission
that
it
didn't
make
a
finding
that
there
was
no
--
the
--
wouldn't
be
in
the
public
interest
to
include
them
in
the
penn-central
is
really
in
the
circumstances
kept
because
i
think
the
commission
is
not
only
in
the
respects
i
have
indicated
but
in
other
respects
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
in
its
view,
these
railroads
belong
in
the
n
&
w
system
and
what
we
have
left
here
is
simply
a
quarrel
over
how
much
money
they
--
n
&
w
should
pay
or
how
much
money
they
should
get.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
penn-central
merger
cannot
be
consummated
and
that
question
of
money
which
is
essentially
a
private
question
be
litigated
after
consummation.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
what
i
mean.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
what
i
meant.
and
in
the
second
or
the
first
report
on
reconsideration,
the
commission
said,
the
d
&
h
at
that
time
asked
for
some
change
in
the
appendix
g
conditions
that
they
find
that
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
--
included
in
that
--
in
penn-central
if
it
wasn't
included
in
n
&
w.
and
the
commission
refused
to
make
it
and
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
any
change
in
this
appendix
which
will
open
the
way
to
the
stockholders
of
anyone
of
these
three
railroads
to
refuse
prescribed
conditions
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
while
holding
out
for
better
terms
in
the
penn-central
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
the
commission
has
made
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
am
afraid
i
could
--
would
not
and
could
not
accept
that.
i
would
have
another
argument
to
make
that
event.
my
time
has
expired,
but
i
will
say
that
i
don't
think
that
question
is
right.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
they
don't
have
that
option.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
say
in
their
first
order,
they
said
that
if
the
petitions
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
were
denied
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
then
they
could
renew
their
applications
in
the
court
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
a
year,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
apply,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
see
that
--
they
have
now
--
they
have
been
granted
the
--
in
this
--
and
the
applications
to
go
into
the
n
&
w
has
been
granted
and
the
commission
also
provided
that
if
they
were
granted,
their
applications
for
admission
to
the
penn-central
should
be
deemed
denied.and
i
assume
that
subject
to
whatever
happens
to
the
inclusion
order
on
review
of
those
petitions
and
for
inclusion
to
penn-central
have
been
denied.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
this
case
for
the
new
york
central
and
the
pennsylvania.
the
interest
of
my
client
by
the
course
primarily
in
affirmance
of
so
much
of
the
judgment
below
as
it
allows
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
i
propose
in
the
time
that
has
been
allotted
to
me
to
devote
my
attention
primarily
to
the
arguments
of
those
parties
who
are
seeking
to
defer
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
now,
i
am
obliged
to
say
to
the
court
in
candor
that
i
think
most
of
the
arguments
that
can
be
made
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
had
been
touched
upon
in
one
way
or
another.
i
propose
in
general
simply
to
state
our
position
in
summarily
as
i
can
with
reasons
for
it.
and
if
there
are
any
questions
from
the
bench,
i
shall
do
my
best
to
answer
them.
now
the
objections
to
immediate
consummation
come
largely
from
two
groups.
i
say
largely
because
that
hasn't
been
qualified
but
the
two
groups
who
are
largely
objecting
to
immediate
consummation
are
first,
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven,
not
the
bondholders
of
the
erie
represented
by
mr.
fooshee,
but
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven.
and
i
propose
i
think
to
deal
first
with
their
contention.
now
despite
the
complexity
of
their
argument
and
some
of
the
irrelevancies
with
which
i
think
it
is
counting,
i
think
their
basic
position
can
be
stated
quite
simply
and
i
think
answers
them.
their
basic
and
ultimate
position
is
that
this
merger
should
not
be
consummated
until
the
penn-central
agrees
to
absorb
all
of
the
operating
losses
of
the
new
haven
for
the
period
that
must
elapse
between
consummation
of
the
merger
and
the
final
completion
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
actual
physical
and
legal
inclusion
of
new
haven
into
penn-central.
now
they
state
that
in
different
ways,
they
sometimes
describe
it
as
interim
inclusion,
of
course
it
isn't
inclusion
at
all
really.
they
sometimes
talk
about
a
lease
or
about
an
operating
agreement.
but
it
all
comes
back
to
the
proposition
that
the
penn-central
should
absorb
all
of
those
losses
in
this
area.
now
they've
had
a
hearing
on
this
question
before
the
commission
as
mr.
auerback
explained
to
you,
a
hearing
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
case.
and
the
commission
recognized
that
there
should
be
some
arrangement
to
sharing
these
losses.
but
the
commission
declined
to
require
penn-central
to
absorb
all
the
operating
losses
and
it
made
findings
and
stated
reasons
for
that.
it
found
in
the
first
place
that,
of
course
under
any
interim
arrangement
of
this
kind,
penn-central
will
not
have
the
power
of
an
owner.
it
can't
deal
with
and
dispose
the
property
the
way
an
owner
can
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
achieve
the
kind
of
operating
economies
and
efficiencies
that
can
be
expected
after
inclusion.
and
since
its
power
would
be
limited
in
that
way,
the
commission
said
--
thought
that
that
was
a
reason
for
not
requiring
it
assume
all
these
interim
losses.
it's
a
--
i
think
a
reasonable
proposition.
you
don't
have
a
complete
power
to
manage
and
you
shouldn't
have
complete
responsibility
with
the
losses.
but
the
commission
then
went
on
to
a
second
point
which
is
quite
important
and
say
--
pointed
out
that
if
the
penn-central
should
be
required
to
absorb
all
of
these
operating
losses,
the
bankruptcy
law
and
the
bankruptcy
statute
being
what
it
is,
the
litigation
among
the
parties
to
this
bankruptcy
proceeding
could
proceed
endlessly.
they
would
have
no
incentive
to
impose
their
differences
or
to
terminate
that
litigation
because
their
position
would
be
preserved
for
all
this
period
of
time
went
on.
the
penn-central
will
be
paying
the
operating
losses.
the
commission
therefore
found
that
it
--
and
stated
it
in
just
about
these
words
in
this
november
21st
opinion.
it
said
we
think
that
we
can
best
accomplish
our
objective
which
is
prompt
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
into
penn-central
in
that
real
sense.
if
we
require
all
the
interested
parties
to
share
in
these
losses,
that
will
give
everybody
an
incentive
to
compose
the
differences
and
to
litigate
with
expedition
and
get
this
proceeding
terminated.
and
accordingly,
it
provided
for
a
sharing
of
the
losses.
this
whole
arrangement
last
for
three
years
because
that
was
an
estimate
of
the
party
that
what
might
be
required
for
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
commission
applied
the
formula
of
the
operating
losses
to
determine
what
losses
should
be
shared
and
made
an
order
that
required
the
penn-central
to
take
and
absorb
100%
of
the
losses
in
the
first
year,
50%
in
the
second
year
and
25%
in
the
third
year
with
a
ceiling
on
the
total
amount
this
year
to
be
required
and
to
be
sought.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
order
that
the
commission
--
which
the
commission
did
this.
an
order
was
made
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
case
and
the
courts
can
do
--
can
be
and
doubtless
will
be
reviewed
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
usual
way.
and
as
mr.
auerback
points
out
of
course,
upon
that
review,
the
commission
--
the
orders
remanded
to
the
commission,
the
commission
has
to
fix
terms
(inaudible)
owners
on
the
penn-central.
the
penn-central
having
consummated
the
merger
if
it's
allowed
to
do
in
the
meantime
will
be
bound
by
those
conditions
as
a
result
of
the
commission's
original
order.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
are
--
i'm
quite
clear
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
action
in
an
inclusion
case
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time
to
review
and
i
mentioned
it
simply
to
show
that
this
basis
of
which
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
are
asking
to
have
the
penn-central
merger
held
up.
it
is
a
basis
which
has
been
reviewed
by
the
commission
which
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission
and
is
to
which
they
can
get
judicial
review
and
as
to
which
they
will
not
be
prejudiced
if
the
merger
is
allowed
to
be
consummated
as
judge
--
as
the
court
below
held.
that's
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
not
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
rights
--
they
argue
of
great
many
things
but
i
think
they
all
can
be
subsumed
under
the
propositions
i
have
stated
to
you.
now,
i
should
like
to
leave
if
i
may
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
at
that
point
and
start
to
talk
about
the
argument
of
the
norfolk
&
western
which
one
of
their
arguments
which
is
that
even
if
the
inclusion
order
is
affirmed,
the
penn-central
merger
should
not
be
consummated
this
time
because
one
or
another
of
the
three
railroads
are
there
because
of
action
of
their
managements
or
their
stockholders,
principally
the
stockholders
they
speak
of,
will
not
accept
the
terms
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
that
have
been
prescribed
by
that
order.
now
i
really
think
that
i
should
not
--
i
don't
intend
to
spend
much
time
on
that
argument.
i
simply
should
like
to
say
this,
that
as
we
--
i
submit
that
the
responsibility
of
the
commission
under
the
statute
and
under
its
own
findings
in
the
first
case,
and
i
say
under
the
opinion
and
mandate
of
this
court
on
the
previous
people,
are
satisfied
and
completely
satisfied
if
the
commission
gives
each
of
these
railroads
an
opportunity
to
be
included
in
a
major
system
on
the
basis
of
terms
described
to
stare
in
which
you
affirmed
on
judicial
review.
now
if
one
of
these
railroads
or
two
of
them,
the
managements,
the
stockholders
in
pursuit
of
their
private
interest
decide
to
reject
these
terms,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
reason
for
holding
up
this
merger
or
rejecting
the
commission's
findings
that
the
consummation
of
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
i
submit
that
any
other
view
of
the
matter
would
put
the
exercise
of
regulatory
authority
completely
at
the
mercy
of
private
interest.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
really
should,
i
submit,
dispose
of
the
argument
that
is
made
which
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
inclusion
order
will
be
affirmed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
alright,
i
find
--
i
take
this
position
even
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
the
commission,
if
they
decide
that
they
will
not
take
the
opportunity
that
the
commission
has
given
them,
the
commission
can't
force
them
into
a
system
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
and
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
they
should
be
allowed
to
force
the
commission
or
the
courts
for
that
matter
to
hold
up
a
merger
which
is
otherwise
has
been
found
to
be
an
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
--
i
think
the
court
held
that.
but
i
think
the
court
is
not
explicit,
it
is
implicit
in
the
--
what
the
court
held.
what
the
court's
holding
was
directed
to
as
a
public
responsibility
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
suggest
if
i
may,
that
i
do
not
read
the
court's
opinion
of
holding
that
if
the
stockholders
of
one
of
these
roads
for
private
reasons
refused
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
don't
have
the
right
to
stay
independent
in
that
sense,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
or
they
do
so
at
their
own
account.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
do
so.
they
remain
independent,
their
own
peril.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
--
if
they
decide
to
commit
suicide,
the
public
is
deprived
of
their
service.
now
that's
a
harsh
result.
you
don't
have
that
result,
they
can
--
they
control
this.
of
course
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
will
happen,
i
understand.
i'm
putting
this
in
terms
of
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
legal
principles
but
a
notion
that
these
roads
are
going
to
commit
suicide
is
one
that
i
think
the
court
need
to
accept.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
they
have
--
of
course
they
have
a
right
to
stay
independent
which
they
do
so
at
their
own
risk.
if
they
can't
work
out
an
arrangement
if
they
can't
survive,
mr.
silleck
seems
to
think
the
two
of
them
will
survive
even
as
independent.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it's
a
kind
of
--
the
public
interest
in
the
larger
merger
creates
the
situation
where
something
has
to
be
done
with
these
lines
and
the
only
--
the
thing
that
the
commission
can
do
is
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
them
to
become
members
of
a
larger
railroad
system.
i
think
that
seems
to
me
harsh
as
it
is
to
be
a
--
of
the
result
that's
contemplated
by
the
provisions
of
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
right,
precisely
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
a
subject
to
which
i
am
not
in
the
authority
but
i
understand
that
what
the
commission
valued
as
the
commission
fixed
for
including
the
new
haven
in
the
penn-central
was
its
--
what
the
commission
found
to
be
its
actual
liquidation
value
today.
what
it
would
--
what
you
would
get
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
sorry,
i
can't
give
you
the
dollar
figure
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
$125
million,
that's
what
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
--
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
bonds
made
the
securities
maybe
overvalued.
what
the
commission
did
mr.
justice
black
was
to
fix
the
value
on
the
basis
of
what
you
would
get
for
the
property
if
you
sold
it
in
liquidation
today.
they
went
out
of
business,
what
do
they
get
for
it.
now,
i
frankly
have
to
say
that
the
evidence
that
supports
that
determination
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
that
question
of
valuation
isn't
here.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
that
of
course
is
in
part
our
position.
they
can't
necessarily
expect
to
get
the
full
value
of
what
it's
worth
today.
and
--
but
that
again
is
not
a
question
that's
involve
the
case
before
the
court
today,
i
think,
that
will
be
determined
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
the
inclusion
case
which
was
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
what
you're
being
urged
to
do
by
the
new
haven
trustees
mr.
justice
black
is
to
act
promptly
to
save
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
railroad
not
the
stockholders
and
the
bondholders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
the
basis
of
the
findings.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
based
on
the
other,
its
desire
to
preserve
the
transportation
facilities
of
new
haven.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
on
the
basis
of
the
current
market
value
because
i
think
of
the
securities.
i
think
it's
on
the
basis
of
a
liquidations
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
right.
and
the
commission
acted
on
the
first
basis,
not
on
the
second
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
on
the
plan.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
if
the
plan
of
reorganization
goes
through
apart
from
these
--
to
the
consideration
which
will
be
received,
will
be
stuck
in
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
there
are
some
other
considerations
involved
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
quite
correct.
they
will
--
the
deficit
then
will
be
born,
if
there
is
one,
the
operating
deficit
will
be
born
by
the
merged
company.
it
will
be
up
to
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
go
forward
but
then
if
they
didn't
create
the
whole
transaction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
can't
get
out
of
it
if
they
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
if
they
consummate
the
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
the
--
it's
stuck
with
it
in
this
sense
in
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
that
having
consummated
the
merger,
you
have
the
penn-central
--
two
companies
involved
by
that
act,
it
would
be
found
by
any
conditions
that
the
commission
fixed
or
--
originally
or
on
remand
under
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
act
to
be
so
far
as
this
new
haven
situation
is
concerned.
i
now
should
like
to
--
there's
one
other
point
that
i
should
like
to
deal
with
and
that
is
the
argument
which
i
think
can
somewhat
confused
here,
to
what
should
happen
so
far
as
the
merger
is
concerned
in
the
event
that
the
inclusion
order
should
be
found
by
this
court
to
be
effective
in
certain
respects
and
the
inclusion
case
remanded
to
the
commission
for
further
consideration.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
any
infirmity
in
the
inclusion
order.
we
didn't
litigate
the
inclusion
order,
my
clients
didn't
but
either
--
before
the
commission
or
before
the
court,
and
we
have
an
interest
in
it
only
insofar
as
it
affects
the
merger.
but
assuming
that
there
is
some
infirmity
in
the
inclusion
order
and
that
this
court
should
direct
to
remand,
we
submit
that
even
so,
the
penn-central
merger
should
now
be
consummated.
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
that
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
arguments
here
this
morning
as
it
looked
clear
from
the
papers
i
think
of
the
parties
in
this
case
that
what
is
left
in
the
inclusion
case,
and
this
is
true
whether
one
or
two
lines
payout.
what
is
left
in
the
inclusion
case
is
a
dispute
essentially
in
private,
in
character
about
how
much
money
the
n
&
w
should
pay
for
those
lines.
and
we
submit
that
the
merger
itself,
the
penn-central
merger
need
not
and
should
not
be
held
up
even
if
there
is
a
remand
pending
the
resolution
of
that
dispute
over
how
much
money
the
n
&
w
should
pay.
it
is
not
necessary
to
hold
up
the
merger
to
protect
the
three
lines
that
are
involved,
the
three
smaller
railroads
because
they
are
now
protected
by
the
perfected
appendix
g
conditions
and
not
one
of
the
three
railroads
is
challenging
those
conditions
in
this
court.
it
seemed
to
regard
in
these
sets
of
fact.
the
n
&
w
has
not
pointed
in
anyway
which
it
would
be
prejudiced
if
there
is
a
remand
on
how
much
money
it
should
pay
for
the
three
lines
and
in
the
meantime,
these
mergers
consummated.
it
will
still
be
able
to
make
all
of
its
arguments
about
how
much
money
it
should
pay
and
it
can
get
judicial
review
with
those
arguments.
our
definition
in
the
courts
will
not
be
affected
in
anyway
by
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
so
far
as
concerns
what
is
really
the
essential
of
the
question
of
public
interest
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
the
commission
has
decided.
clearly
as
it
can
to
be
decided
in
finding
--
with
these
findings
that
are
imperfect
in
any
respect,
there
the
imperfection
does
not
affect
the
substance
that
these
three
railroads
if
they're
willing
to
go,
belong
so
far
as
concerned
to
public
interest,
in
the
n
&
w.
the
commission
found
that
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
was
preferable
to
inclusion
in
penn-central.
the
commission
found
that
there
was
a
better
chance
of
preserving
their
transportation
facilities
if
they
were
included
in
n
&
w
than
they
would
be
if
they
were
included
in
the
penn-central.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
criticism
of
the
commission
that
it
didn't
make
a
finding
that
there
was
no
--
the
--
wouldn't
be
in
the
public
interest
to
include
them
in
the
penn-central
is
really
in
the
circumstances
kept
because
i
think
the
commission
is
not
only
in
the
respects
i
have
indicated
but
in
other
respects
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
in
its
view,
these
railroads
belong
in
the
n
&
w
system
and
what
we
have
left
here
is
simply
a
quarrel
over
how
much
money
they
--
n
&
w
should
pay
or
how
much
money
they
should
get.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
penn-central
merger
cannot
be
consummated
and
that
question
of
money
which
is
essentially
a
private
question
be
litigated
after
consummation.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
what
i
mean.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
precisely
what
i
meant.
and
in
the
second
or
the
first
report
on
reconsideration,
the
commission
said,
the
d
&
h
at
that
time
asked
for
some
change
in
the
appendix
g
conditions
that
they
find
that
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
--
included
in
that
--
in
penn-central
if
it
wasn't
included
in
n
&
w.
and
the
commission
refused
to
make
it
and
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
any
change
in
this
appendix
which
will
open
the
way
to
the
stockholders
of
anyone
of
these
three
railroads
to
refuse
prescribed
conditions
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
while
holding
out
for
better
terms
in
the
penn-central
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
the
commission
has
made
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
am
afraid
i
could
--
would
not
and
could
not
accept
that.
i
would
have
another
argument
to
make
that
event.
my
time
has
expired,
but
i
will
say
that
i
don't
think
that
question
is
right.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
they
don't
have
that
option.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
say
in
their
first
order,
they
said
that
if
the
petitions
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
were
denied
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
then
they
could
renew
their
applications
in
the
court
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
a
year,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
apply,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
see
that
--
they
have
now
--
they
have
been
granted
the
--
in
this
--
and
the
applications
to
go
into
the
n
&
w
has
been
granted
and
the
commission
also
provided
that
if
they
were
granted,
their
applications
for
admission
to
the
penn-central
should
be
deemed
denied.and
i
assume
that
subject
to
whatever
happens
to
the
inclusion
order
on
review
of
those
petitions
and
for
inclusion
to
penn-central
have
been
denied.
