mr.
ernest
r.
von
starck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
time
allowed
for
this
argument
does
not
permit
of
a
legal
analysis
in
depth
but
i
would
hope,
be
able
to
achieve
your
interest
and
perhaps
your
sympathy
in
a
problem
of
reading
which
is
unique.
it's
particularly
unique
since
it
doesn't
relate
to
a
dilemma
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
law.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
reading
railroad
is
the
only
small
railroad
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
united
states
that
has
not
received
the
protection
of
appendix
g
condition
and
has
no
assurance
of
a
home
in
a
large
system.
we
are
concerned,
deeply
concerned
that
in
the
haste
with
which
this
case
must
be
concluded
that
reading's
problem
may
not
receive
the
attention
which
we
think
it
deserve.
it's
quite
possible
that
reading
may
be
the
railroad
which
mr.
justice
brennan
had
in
mind
when
he
said
he
feared
that
a
case
by
case
system
of
restructuring
the
eastern
railroads
which
had
been
insisted
upon
by
the
commission
who
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
a
railroad
performing
an
essential
public
service.
now
reading's
problem,
drawn
out
of
the
fact
that
when
the
penn-central
merger
was
first
proposed,
reading
did
not
ask
inclusion.
it
introduced
no
evidence
of
traffic
diversion
and
did
not
oppose
the
merger.
they
did
this
because
at
that
time,
it
believed
that
there
were
reasons
why
it
would
soon
be
merged
into
b
&
o-c
&
o.
b
&
o
had
retained
experts
to
make
merger
studies.
it
had
increased
its
holdings
from
40%
to
almost
50%
of
the
reading
stock
and
it
had
supplied
reading
with
qualified
officers
for
the
express
purpose
of
restoring
reading
to
a
profitable
basis.
however,
b
&
o
began
to
cool
on
its
merger
plans
and
in
august
1965,
reading
management
learned
to
regret
their
decision
to
have
kept
out
of
the
penn-central
case.
at
that
time,
n
&
w
and
c
&
o
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
world,
announced
their
merger
plans
which
included
reading
and
cnj,
reading's
subsidiary,
solely
as
a
part
of
the
dereco
package.
the
dereco
package
consisted
of
the
five
small
railroads.
it
was
immediately
clear
to
the
reading
management
that
this
plan
would
take
years
for
approval
and
might
even
never
be
approved
and
that
in
the
meantime,
reading
would
have
to
meet
the
full
force
of
the
penn-central
competition
unprotected.
and
i
say,
full
force
of
the
competition,
i
mean
it.
reading's
lines
are
practically
parallel
by
the
pennsylvania
line.
virtually
every
large
customer
that
reading
has
is
also
a
customer
of
the
pennsylvania.
mr.
ernest
r.
von
starck
reading
lines
are
located
primarily
in
eastern
pennsylvania
with
trackage
up
into
new
jersey
and
some
down
into
delaware.
there
is
no
city
of
any
consequence
that
reading
serves
that
is
not
also
served
by
pennsylvania.
and
obviously
with
the
inducements
that
penn-central
will
have
after
this
merger
many,
many
of
reading's
primary
customers
can
be
wooed
away
and
this
is
what
concerned
reading
very
much.
at
the
time
it
discovered
that
its
merger
plans
were
completely
frustrated,
it
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
but
it
acted
just
as
soon
as
it
could
and
that
was
when
the
commission's
order
came
out
approving
the
penn-central
and
providing
this
unanticipated
appendix
g
condition.
those
were
unprecedented,
and
up
until
that
time,
nobody
had
ever
realized
that
the
commission
would
provide
interim
protection
for
a
railroad
until
it
had
been
included
into
a
major
system.
however,
when
reading
asked
that
the
record
be
opened
and
that
it
would
be
permitted
to
put
in
this
evidence,
the
commission
turned
down
reading
on
the
simple
ground
that
it
was
guilty
of
latches.
and
that
they
expressed
an
unfounded
suspicion,
that
it
was
a
scheme
instigated
by
n
&
w
to
delay
the
penn-central
merger.
now,
i
don't
have
any
more
time
but
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
the
district
court
affirmed
the
commission
on
these
same
grounds
of
delay
and
i
think
it
is
an
obvious
principle
of
administrative
law
that
the
responsibility
of
this
commission
is
through
the
public.
it
is
not
a
passive
arbitrary,
it
must
accept
evidence
that
is
relevant
with
respect
to
the
public
interest
and
we
now
ask
this
court
to
correct
both
the
district
court
and
the
commission
and
to
direct
that
commission
to
accept
the
evidence
of
public
interest
which
we
have
to
offer.
and
we
do
not
ask
that
the
merger
be
stayed
pending
there
because
if
we
are
found
to
be
entitled
to
indemnity
conditions,
they
can
be
made
retroactive
and
the
public
that
is
served
by
reading
will
be
protected.
mr.
ernest
r.
von
starck
no
--
mr.
ernest
r.
von
starck
yes
sir.
and
to
direct
that
if
indemnity
conditions
are
found
to
be
appropriate
that
they
maybe
made
retroactive.
thank
you.
