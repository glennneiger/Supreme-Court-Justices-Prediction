i'm
talking

that's
the
--
justice

what
i'm
asking
--
justice
hugo

black
what
i'm
asking
is
quite
different,
that
the
number
here,
objecting
to
this
going
through
and
like
reservations
are
made
to
do
certain
things
in
the

to
the

how
can
you
put
through

on
any

justice

do
you
think
following
your
suggestion,
the
suggestion
about
the

will
result
in
factually
frustrating
the
completion
of
the

after
the

why?
justice

you

well,
that
(inaudible)
tend

justice

are
you
saying
that
what
the
order
they
are
making
with
reference
to
your
people
will
cause
the
bondholders
to
lose
a
part
of
their
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
i
assume
from
what
you
say
is
that
new
haven
is
losing
money
in
a
very,
very
rapid
range.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
going
to
go
with
that
when
they
get
--
with
these
few
measures?will
they
still
be
losing
that
much
money?
justice
hugo

black
why?
justice
hugo

black
how
much
is
it
losing
now?
justice

but
who
is
going

absorb
that
loss?
justice

that
would
take
money
away
from

of
the

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice

black
mr.
cox,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
not
quite
(inaudible)
preserving
the
new
haven
railroad,
is
that
thought
of
preserving
the
new
haven
railroad
as
such
at
its
actual
value
(inaudible)
what
seems
to
be
inflated
by
this
on
the
bonds.
justice
hugo

what
did
they
find
at
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
somebody
tell
me
what
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
the
question
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
railroad
losing
as
much
as
it's
losing.
it
seems
to
be
inevitable
for
this
long
continuing
thing
must
be
overvalued.
how
could
it
(voice

--
justice
hugo

(inaudible)trying
to
go
broke
down
the
rope
and
consume
all
of
it,
the
bonds
and
everything
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
--
if
i
understood
the
railroad,
the
necessity
for
it
to
survive,
this
isn't
based
on
the
necessity
of
the
bondholders,
it's
the
stockholders
getting
that
full
value
on
what
they
think
this
is
worth
today
even
though
it's
a
failing
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
seem
to
be
involved
to
the
extent
that
we
are
urged
and
act
--
and
to
act
instantly
in
order
to
save
a
railroad
on
its
present
financial
setup.
justice
hugo

is
that
the

the
commission
findings?
justice
hugo

it
is
not

it
wouldn't
be

done

put
