mr.
lester
c.
migdal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
government
and
the
trustees
comes
to
this,
that
the
commission
having
determined
that
the
continuation
of
new
haven's
railroad
service,
passenger
and
freight
is
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
correct
in
assuming
that
it
may
require
the
owners
of
the
railroad
to
sell
the
assets
necessary
for
a
continuation
of
these
services.
that
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
cox
and
everyone
else
has
recognized
that
it
cannot
compel
such
a
sale
and
that
the
smaller
railroads
injured
in
these
instances
are
not
required
to
sell.
now
what
does
that
mean
in
this
context?
it
means
that
if
you
permit
the
penn-central
merger
to
go
ahead
at
this
time,
you
will
not
save
the
new
haven
service,
you
will
destroy
the
new
haven
service
because
the
new
haven
is
presently
owned
by
the
bondholders
whom
i
represent.
and
those
bondholders
cannot
consent
in
the
light
of
the
serious
losses
which
are
falling
upon
the
new
haven.
they
cannot
consent
to
a
continuation
on
extension
of
those
losses
not
for
another
minute.
it
is
no
good
to
them
that
you
are
going
to
erode
these
assets
by
borrowing.
it
is
no
good
to
them
that
you
are
going
to
find
the
way
for
them
to
sustain
these
losses
for
three
years.
none
of
that
is
of
any
use
to
them.
this
merger
if
it
goes
forward
today
will
destroy
the
new
haven
and
its
operations
because
the
commission
has
made
the
mistake
throughout
and
believing
that
it
had
the
right
and
the
power
to
compel
the
sale
by
the
new
haven
of
its
operations
to
penn-central.
it
was
a
direct
value
--
it
was
a
direct
violation
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
st.
joe
paper
case.
and
as
mr.
isaacs
has
pointed
out,
the
method
by
which
it
was
sought
to
be
achieved
was
by
requiring
the
continuance
of
loss
operations,
loss
operations
that
mr.
auerbach
described
to
you
as
going
on
at
the
rate
of
20
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
now,
it
is
not
correct.
it
is
not
correct
that
it
remains
in
the
public
interest
for
this
merger
to
go
ahead
even
though
the
new
haven
railroad
will
be
destroyed
as
it
must
be
destroyed
and
thus
these
bondholders
for
their
own
self-protection
must
take
steps
to
destroy
it.
in
penn-central,
it
has
been
recognized
or
is
in
the
public
interest
because
it
was
including
the
new
haven.
but
if
you
do
not
provide
for
taking
up
the
losses
of
the
new
haven
simultaneously
with
the
merger
of
penn-central,
if
that
does
not
happen,
then
the
new
haven
will
not
nor
should
it
be
a
sale.
these
burdens
have
fallen
now.
these
public
interest
burdens
have
fallen
now
on
the
bondholders
for
six
years
in
these
sums
which
are
extravagant
and
monumental.
mr.
auerbach
still
cannot
tell
you
whether
connecticut
today
will
help
take
up
some
of
those
losses
in
this
intervening
period
for
which
penn-central
was
going
to
lend
us
money
and
erode
our
interest.
the
notion
has
been
that
the
public
interest
must
be
served
by
the
private
sector,
by
these
bondholders
and
we
have
served
it
to
the
point
where
we're
exhausted.
we
will
not
serve
it
longer.
if
the
public
interest
will
not
--
if
the
states
will
not
come
in,
if
penn-central
will
not
come
in,
if
somebody
will
not
come
in
to
take
up
these
losses,
the
railroad
will
go
down.
it
ought
to
go
down.
it
is
not
a
proper
solution
to
put
the
burden
of
the
public
interest
upon
these
bondholders.
and
the
commission
in
all
these
cases
from
st.
joe
on
has
never
been
able
to
compel
a
new
--
a
railroad
like
the
new
haven
to
accept
a
merger
as
a
solution.

you.
