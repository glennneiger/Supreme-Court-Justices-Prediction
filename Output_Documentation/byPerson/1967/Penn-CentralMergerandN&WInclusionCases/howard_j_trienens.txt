mr.
howard
j.
trienens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
been
assigned
50
minutes
and
i
hope
to
save
a
few
moments
for
reply.
last
term,
the
court
held
the
penn-central
merger
should
not
be
consummated
until
the
ultimate
thing,
the
three
railroads
had
--
have
been
determined.
the
court
stated
that
this
meant
a
decision
on
the
inclusion
of
these
three
railroads
in
a
major
system
prior
to
the
consummation
of
penn-central
merger.
but
the
underlying
reason
for
that
holding
was
the
economic
fact
that
penn-central
merger
will
destroy
three
other
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
&
hudson,
boston
&
maine.
the
commission
expressly
found
that
this
would
happen
and
since
the
case
was
before
this
court,
that
finding
has
not
been
modified
and
has
not
been
challenged
by
any
party.
now,
the
commission
has
held
that
penn-central
can
be
consummated
and
why,
because
the
commission
has
issued
an
order
in
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case.
the
commission's
order
directs
norfolk
&
western
to
pay
out
some
$130
million
in
stock
and
cash
to
acquire
the
equity
ownership,
not
the
properties
but
the
equity
ownership
of
these
three
railroads
and
to
include
them
as
separate
subsidiary
corporations
in
the
n
&
w
system.
now
the
reason
for
the
form
of
this
order,
i'm
giving
erie
as
an
example,
is
that
n
&
w
is
required
to
buy
the
stock
of
erie.
it's
not
merged
and
it's
not
integrated
completely
because
merger
was
out
of
the
question.as
the
commission
found,
merger
was
nowhere
in
sight.
the
reason
it's
nowhere
in
sight
is
that
erie
had
$350
million
of
debt.
everybody
recognized
that
that
made
merger
out
of
question,
and
the
reason
of
course
was
that
erie
bondholders
who
are
appellants
in
this
court
refused
to
do
anything
to
modify
that
bond
for
that
debt
and
they
said
they'd
rather
have
erie
go
bankrupt
than
modify
the
debt.
and
so,
we
have
these
corporations.
n
&
w
acquires
their
stock
by
going
into
n
&
w
subsidiary
corporation,
separate
corporations
and
if
they
fail
to
meet
their
fixed
charges
individually,
they
can
go
into
bankruptcy.
it's
essential
to
us
--
compare
what
this
order
does
for
erie
stockholders
but
what
it
does
for
the
erie
corporation
upon
whom
the
commission
relies
to
provide
necessary
transportation
service.
now
why
is
it
that
n
&
w
is
required
to
buy
the
stock
of
erie
for
example.
here
is
the
public
interest
finding
and
i
think
it's
critical
to
read
this
because
the
district
court
completely
ignored
its
existence.
i
can
read
the
district
court
opinion
through
and
never
know
this
finding
occurred
but
this
is
why
in
the
public
interest,
n
&
w
was
required
to
buy
this
stock,
because
it
included
--
if
erie
is
included
in
n
&
w
by
way
of
control,
control
meaning
we
buy
the
stock.
these
roads
would
be
able
to
continue
to
provide
adequate
transportation
service
and
why
is
that?
because
and
only
because
of
this
express
finding,
the
normal
earnings
of
each
petitioner,
the
normal
earnings
of
each
petitioner
after
inclusion
will
be
sufficient
to
meet
their
fixed
charges.
these
normal
earnings
concept
and
these
normal
earnings
findings
are
critical
not
only
to
the
price
we
had
to
pay.
price
was
geared
to
these
normal
earnings.
but
it
was
also
critical
and
underlies
the
commission's
sole
public
interest
finding
as
to
why
n
&
w
had
to
acquire
the
stock.
and
so
i
begin
by
describing
how
the
commission
found
and
arrived
at
the
so-called
normal
earnings
of
erie
railroad.
erie
had
a
deficit
of
$8
million
in
1964.
it
had
deficits
every
year
for
years
prior
there
to.
1965
and
1966,
erie
reported
net
income
averaging
$5
million,
deficits
and
net
income
1965-1966.
the
commission
took
that
$5
million
of
net
income
in
those
two
years.
it
added
$4.5
million
which
represented
a
subsidy
that
the
new
jersey
state
was
expected
to
and
did
commit
itself
to
pay
erie
to
continue
to
run
erie's
--
erie
commuter
service
and
a
subsidy
in
the
amount
of
$4.5
million
a
year
additional
subsidy.
$5
million
that
they
made
in
these
two
years
plus
the
$4.5
million,
that's
$9.5
million
of
normal
earnings.
now
bear
in
mind,
this
isn't
a
guess
into
the
farthest
in
future.
this
is
a
finding
that
erie
had
achieved
normal
earnings
of
$9.5
million
by
the
end
of
1966.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
and
i
don't
regard
that
if
i
have
to
buy
a
corporation
that's
supposed
to
be
earning
$9.5
million,
i
think
the
fact
that
$4.5
million
is
a
subsidy
dependent
on
year-to-year
appropriations
of
a
legislature
makes
that
a
far
different
character
of
earnings,
but
that's
what
part
it
is.
that's
$4.5
million
of
the
$9.5
million
is
the
subsidy.
now,
these
past
deficits
were
disregarded
by
the
commission
and
passed
aside
on
the
ground
that
erie's
new
management
had
achieved
a
sensational
turnaround.
a
sensational
turnaround
from
all
of
these
deficits
now
we're
earning
$5
million
and
we're
going
to
get
this
subsidy,
so
it's
a
corporation
that's
going
to
earn
$9.5
million
a
year,
and
that's
what
n
&
w
was
sold.
well,
it's
been
some
turnaround.
it's
been
a
complete
circle
starting
with
this
deficit
of
$8
million
in
1964,
erie
came
up
and
earned
an
average
of
$5
million
for
1965-1966.
but
this
year,
erie
is
losing
money,
it's
backed
the
deficits
to
the
tune
of
$10
million
a
year.
for
the
first
nine
months
of
1967,
erie
lost
$7.7
million,
so
it's
now
in
this
year
losing
money,
tuned
about
$10
million
a
year,
that's
what
its
normal
situation
is
now
and
this
has
been
perfectly
apparent
since
early
1967
long
before
the
commission
decided
this
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
they
--
this
reflects
the
realization
of
the
subsidy
they
found
would
occur
so
10
million
is
lost
despite
receiving
that
additional
subsidy.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
that's
my
--
that's
what
we've
been
told.
now
i
realize
that
this
function
of
predicting
the
future
is
a
matter
for
experts
and
i
know
that
when
the
weatherman
says
that
it's
going
to
be
a
sunny
day
tomorrow,
there's
no
way
i
can
dispute
that,
i
have
to
leave
that
to
experts.
but
when
the
commission's
finding
of
$9.5
million
of
erie's
earnings
is
involved,
we
have
to
remember
that
this
was
not
what's
going
to
happen
tomorrow.
this
was
a
finding
that
they
had
realized
9.5
million
of
earnings.
and
this
is
the
like
the
weatherman
saying
it's
going
to
be
a
sunny
day
all
day
today
and
failing
or
refusing
to
look
out
the
window
to
see
it's
already
raining.
now,
an
erroneous
prediction
under
such
circumstances
isn't
a
prediction
at
all
and
it's
not
a
mere
error
by
some
presumed
foreseer.
this
is
an
arbitrary
action,
arbitrary
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure.
to
act
on
the
premise
that
erie
has
already
achieved
normal
earnings
of
9.5
million,
when
after
receiving
the
subsidy,
erie
is
operating
at
a
normal
deficit,
back
to
the
deficit.
now
this
becomes
especially
arbitrary
when
the
same
weatherman
looked
out
the
window
in
the
penn-central
case
being
decided
at
the
same
time
and
he
found
that
it
was
raining
on
penn-central.
the
commission
in
the
penn-central
case
decided
the
same
time,
refused
to
regard
1965
and
1966
earnings
as
represented
in
approving
penn-central.
and
the
commission
placed
great
reliance
on
the
1967
reports
which
were
before
showing
that
there
had
been
a
decline
in
penn-central
earnings.
not
a
decline
so
that
their
aggregate
was
down
to
a
deficit
but
a
decline
and
they
rely
on
that
to
support
their
approval
of
penn-central.
so
i
say
it's
doubly
arbitrary
when
this
weatherman
will
look
at
the
window
to
see
it's
raining
on
penn-central
but
still
finds
the
theory,
its
normal
earnings
in
$9.5
million
was
perfectly
apparent
to
anybody
to
look
outside
that
it
is
just
isn't
so.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
to
the
penn-central
merger
itself,
we'd
take
the
position
that
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
until
a
--
the
ultimate
faith
of
these
three
railroads
has
been
determined.
the
penn-central
shall
not
be
consummated
so
that
--
i'm
now
talking
about
the
inclusion
case,
i
believe
the
inclusion
case
will
reverse
penn-central
has
to
wait
till
they
straighten
this
up.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
independently
of
that
i
say
your
honor
that
if
penn
--
if
the
inclusion
case
were
affirmed
that
the
situation
is
now
such
that
we
know
and
allow
--
i
shall
demonstrate
it
as
i
get
along
that
the
affirmance
of
the
inclusion
case
will
not
satisfy
the
mandate
of
the
court.
even
if
that's
affirmed,
the
penn-central
case
mandate
has
not
been
satisfied
because
at
least
two
of
these
roads
and
probably
the
erie
as
well,
the
way
it's
set
up,
will
not
have
their
faith
determined.
you
just
won't
know.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
if
by
the
merits
your
honor,
you
mean
whether
we
think
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
such,
no
sir.
no
sir,
we
objected
the
merger,
the
condition
--
we
do
not
object
to
the
merger
itself.
we
do
object
to
the
appendix
g
conditions
attached
to
it
and
what
they
do
to
the
effort
of
other
roads
to
survive,
so
as
conditions
and
the
effort
to
solve
this
problem,
a
problem
created
by
penn-central.
it
that
can
be
so
we
--
we
think
the
benefits
of
penn-central
in
terms
of
efficiencies
should
be
realized.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
power
to
issue
an
order
directing
them
to
do
it?
no
sir,
no
sir.
and
i
must
say
that
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
read
it,
the
motion
to
affirm
rest
on
that
but
it's
sort
of
attitude
--
well,
don't
shoot
the
piano
player,
he
is
doing
the
best
he
can
with
this
kind
of
a
power
that
they
had,
this
limited
power
they
have.
now
the
problem
though,
we
don't
think
risk
on
the
commission's
lack
of
power.
the
problem
is,
what
did
they
do?
the
shambles
that
exist
today
and
i
don't
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
exactly
correct.
however,
there
is
one
factor
that
makes
that
unrealistic
from
the
commissions
point
of
view
and
that
is
the
they've
found
that
b
&
m
cannot
do
it
alone.
the
finding
is
that
they
can't
survive
as
an
independent
railroad.
so
that
alternative
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
economic
impact
of
penn-central.
so
they
can't
do
it
alone.
why
then
do
they
not
leave
the
first
home
that's
found
for
them?
and
the
reason
is
not
the
commission's
lack
of
power.
the
reason
in,
what
the
commission
did
do,
this
--
allowing
this
appendix
g
subsidy
to
enable
these
roads
to
shop
around
for
inclusion
in
penn-central
and
they're
worth
more
to
penn-central
but
it's
this
appendix
g
that
creates
an
artificial
climate
that
enables
these
roads
to
do
that.
it's
that
exercise
of
commission's
power
and
not
its
lack
of
power
that
causes
this
problem.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
have
the
opportunity
to
come
into
n
&
w
on
terms
that
are
not
only
fair
but
i
regard
as
generous
to
the
excess.
but
the
reason
they
don't
want
to
come
in
is
that
they
are
worth
more
to
penn-central.
after
all,
they
provide
the
elimination
of
rail
competition
in
new
england.
they
provide
a
savings
that
we
can't
provide
with
them.
they
are
worth
more
to
penn-central
and
what
has
given
them
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
shop
for
that
situation
and
to
get
more
money
out
of
this
is
two
for
one,
the
commission's
failure
to
determine
the
ultimate
faith.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
decide,
it's
got
to
be
n
&
w
and
not
penn-central.
they
refused
to
do
that
although
i
asked
them
to.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
i
think,
it's
--
it
said
that
till
they
found
the
--
that
for
--
finally
decided
the
ultimate
faith
namely
a
home
in
a
major
system.
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
it's
what
it
says.
and
it's
this
--
it's
the
commission's
failure
to
do
that.
it's
the
commission's
failure
to
find
that
it
ought
to
be
n
&
w
and
not
penn-central
that
lets
them
shop
around
with
a
subsidy
to
pay
the
stockholders.
now
bear
in
mind
this
appendix
g
subsidy
operates
for
the
benefit
of
the
stockholders.
if
the
re
--
traffic
can
just
all
vanish,
penn-central
can
take
all
their
traffic
and
under
this
condition,
the
stockholders
of
b
&
m
can
just
shop
to
their
heart's
delight
for
a
better
price.
this
is
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
would
have.
we
would
have
objected
that
they're
going
into
penn-central
was
not
in
the
interest
of
either
the
public
or
the
remaining
railroads.
but
the
commission,
by
not
deciding
that
one
way
or
the
other
has
left
these
railroads
in
a
position
where
they
can
start
getting
in
this
indemnity
pool
at
penn-central
where
they
can
keep
shopping
to
get
into
penn-central
and
they
can
in
effect
frustrate
this
commission
inclusion
order
which
they
have
done.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
one
road
has
voted
to
accept,
yes
sir,
one
road.
now
when
it
came
to
n
&
w
inclusion
case
and
--
we
are
the
ones
who
are
being
asked
to
give
130
million
for
these
railroads.
when
it
came
to
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
agreed
in
advance
to
do
it
on
equitable
terms
and
i'm
--
i
will
say
to
this
court
that
if
erie
was
a
railroad
earning
10
million
a
year,
the
price
is
right.
we
are
not
here
challenging
the
price
if
in
fact
we
are
buying
a
railroad
with
normal
earnings
of
10
million
a
year
but
we're
not.
everybody
knows
we're
not.
you
can
look
outside
and
see
we're
not.
the
district
court
avoided
this
whole
question
by
saying,
“well,
n
&
w
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
the
price
because
they
get
tax
deductions”.
n
&
w
gets
tax
deduction
so
they're
protecting
their
money.
all
--
in
fact
the
more
money
erie
losses,
the
more
we
get
to
deduct
from
our
consolidated
tax
return
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
as
much
tax
out
of
n
&
w
income,
and
in
effect,
the
u.s.
treasury
is
protecting
us
in
our
payment
to
erie
stockholders.
so
judge
friendly
said,
“well
that
cushion
is
to
blow
on
you”.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
don't
think
when
we
get
a
--
or
sold
a
$10
million
profit
making
company
and
it
turns
out
it's
losing
$10
million,
that
that's
fair
to
n
&
w
without
regard
to
these
tax
scheme.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
even
begin
to
satisfy
the
whole
public
interest
notion
of
this
case
that
the
reason
it's
alright
to
put
erie
and
n
&
w
and
the
reason
it
will
survive
penn-central
is
that
it's
a
profitable
company
making
$10
million
a
year
that
will
stay
out
of
bankruptcy.
we
now
know
that
isn't
so,
we
know
it
isn't
so
before
penn-central
hits
even,
and
yet
the
district
court
opinion
in
this
doesn't
even
face
up
to
the
sole
public
interest
reason
for
forcing
these
railroads
down
to
n
&
w's
unwilling
throat.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
to
erie's
management,
to
erie
stockholders,
they'll
get
a
great
benefit.
they'll
get
paid
as
though
they
are
corporation
or
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
income,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
operating
economies
found
a
total,
a
million
eight,
1.8
million
a
year.
that's
the
magnitude
of
the
operating
economies
found
to
accrue
from
this
kind
of
arrangement
for
railroad
already
earning
10
million
a
year
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
losing
10
million
a
year.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
bear
in
mind,
this
is
all
before
penn-central
hits.
this
is
before
the
impact
of
penn-central.
and
as
our
brief
show,
the
commission
tried
to
say
that
wouldn't
--
well,
it
will
hurt
erie
to
the
tune
of
11
million,
that
wouldn't
--
could
be
offset
by
some
things
that
would
benefit
n
&
w
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
for
that,
the
brief
show
why
that
is
and
the
reason
is
that
erie
never
claimed,
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
notion.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
a
completely
different
point
and
i
say
this
is
completely
different
and
to
emphasize
it,
i
want
to
now
argue
on
the
premise.
totally
wrong
i
believe,
but
the
premise
that
everything
the
commission
did
as
to
all
three
railroads
was
right.
everything
as
to
all
three
was
right.
earnings
there,
everything
they
found
was
true.
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
there
is
a
separate
issue
because
they
sold
these
railroads
to
n
&
w
as
a
package.
both
the
public
interest
findings
as
to
what
they'd
earned
and
the
prices
all
assume
that
all
three
of
these
railroads
are
coming
in
as
a
package
and
this
is
critically
important
because
these
three
railroads
don't
go
off
in
all
different
direction
from
n
&
w.
they
are
economically
interdependent.
interdependent
is
the
finding
of
the
commission.
and
erie
obviously
depends
on
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
for
much
of
its
traffic.
d
&
h's
primary
function
in
life
is
to
serve
as
a
bridge
between
b
&
m
and
erie.
the
commission's
public
interest
finding
assumes
inclusion
of
all
three
but
the
price
is
calculated
on
the
basis
of
all
three.
and
this
was
a
four-way
control
they
call
it.
now,
there's
no
suggestion
of
this
court
that
b
&
m's
coming
into
the
n
&
w
under
this
inclusion
order.
now
the
thing
that
is
remarkable
is
that
this
whole
district
court
opinion
is
constructed
on
the
premise,
the
guess
of
the
district
court
that
d
&
h
was
coming.
now
why
is
that
critical?
the
reason
it's
critical
is
that
what
happens
here
really
is
that
n
&
w
was
faced
with
an
order
that
is
a
practical
matter
requires
us
to
pick
up
erie
alone.
that's
really
what
this
order
does.
it
doesn't
take
care
of
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
because
they're
going
the
other
way.
it
requires
us
to
take
erie
who's
had
this
precipitous
decline
in
its
earnings.
there
is
no
finding
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
as
much
as
i
can,
there
is
no
finding
to
support
the
inclusion
of
erie
alone
in
n
&
w.
the
district
--
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
reanalyze
all
the
commission
opinions
and
take
my
word,
there's
no
finding
because
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
finding.
i'm
going
to
read
the
critical
sentence
of
judge
friendly's
opinion.
“while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
that
d
&
h
also
were
not
included,
rejection
by
d
&
h's
stockholders
is
so
unlikely”,
as
we
shall
later
show,
“that
we
will
not
reverse
on
that
ground,
no
finding
to
support
erie
alone,
but
don't
worry
about
it,
that's
not
a
practical
problem
because
d
&
h
is
coming”.
now
this
is
something
that
the
district
court
says
six
separate
times
in
its
opinion.
we
won't
reverse
on
this
ground
because
erie
--
d
&
h
stockholders
are
so
unlikely
to
reject,
not
even
a
serious
possibility.
the
court
says
that
this
is
not
a
hypothesis,
even
have
a
reality.
we
cannot
take
the
prospect
of
non-inclusion
of
d
&
h
at
all
seriously.
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
take
seriously
the
possibility
that
d
&
h
stockholders
will
reject
their
directors'
unanimous
recommendation
to
accept
the
inclusion
term.
it
just
isn't
a
practical
possibility
and
therefore,
we
can
forget
about
the
concern
of
n
&
w
that
here,
they
had
an
order,
that's
a
package
and
they're
going
to
take
erie
alone
because
d
&
h
is
coming
so
found
by
the
district
court.
it's
on
this
basis
that
the
order
is
affirmed
even
though
it
didn't
have
the
finding
to
support
inclusion
of
erie
alone.
now
this
leaves
n
&
w
holding
the
bag
as
it
were.
what
if
the
d
--
district
court
guessed
wrong,
we're
still
stuck
with
the
owner.
they
affirmed
it.
we
get
stuck
with
buying
the
interdependent
erie
at
the
same
price.
no
public
interest
finding
in
including
erie
alone.
district
court
holding,
there
aren't
sufficient
findings
but
we're
stuck
with
the
order.
and
where
--
we
were
simply
not
saying
one
about
the
d
&
h
vote
because
we
knew
that
it
took
a
two
thirds
affirmative
vote
of
d
&
h
to
come
in.
we
knew
that
d
&
h's
principal
stockholder
who
also
happens
to
be
its
president
had
refused
to
say
how
he
is
going
to
vote.
now
we
said
that
to
this
court
in
our
papers,
the
solicitor
general
called
our
fears
“mere
speculation”
based
entirely
upon
a
statement
of
d
&
h's
president
made
before,
italicized
before
the
d
&
h
board
of
directors
unanimously
voted
to
recommend
to
the
stockholders
that
inclusion
terms
would
be
accepted.
so
the
erie
comes
along,
the
erie
whose
loan
inclusion
in
n
&
w
is
unsupported
by
findings
as
held
by
the
district
court
and
they
also
ridicule
our
concern.
here's
what
erie
had
to
say
last
monday
in
their
motion
to
affirm.
n
&
w's
speculation
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
may
after
all
this
time
and
effort
elect
not
to
become
part
of
n
&
w
appears
highly
exaggerated.
the
inclusion
of
d
&
h
in
n
&
w
is
assured,
assured.
d
&
h
does
not
challenge
the
terms
fixed
by
the
commission.
its
board
of
directors
has
voted
unanimously
to
recommend
to
its
stockholders
acceptance
of
the
terms
proposed
by
the
commission.
well,
that
was
last
monday.
we
received
saturday
morning
a
letter
addressed
to
this
court
from
counsel
for
d
&
h
who
had
told
the
district
court
upon
whose
--
district
court
relied
that
the
d
&
h
board
had
unanimously
voted
to
recommend
these
terms.
here
is
the
letter
to
the
honorable
sirs.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
is
from
counsel
for
d
&
h
to
the
court.
first
paragraph
as
set
forth
by
the
undersigned
counsel
to
the
district
court,
the
d
&
h
board
of
directors
voted
on
september
26
to
recommend
approval
of
the
terms
provided
the
commission's
orders
are
held
by
the
court.
on
november
29th,
1967,
mr.
f.c.
dumaine
jr.,
a
member
of
the
d
&
h
board
advised
that
board
that
he
is
in
the
process
of
formulating
an
alternative
proposal
for
d
&
h's
future
and
that
he
would
not
vote
to
recommend
the
n
&
w
inclusion
terms
if
when
they
are
submitted
to
d
&
h
stockholders,
he
is
in
a
position
to
recommend
an
alternative
which
in
his
judgment
is
in
the
better
interest
of
the
stockholders.
now
this
mr.
dumaine
deserves
an
introduction.
he
is
more
than
a
member
of
the
board.
he
is
by
far
d
&
h's
largest
stockholder.
he
owns
over
11-12%
of
their
total
stock
and
he's
eight
times
larger
than
anybody
else
in
the
board
or
owners.
he
happens
to
be
their
president
and
this
is
where
we
stand
today.
the
closing
paragraph
of
counsel's
letter
says
that
in
view
of
mr.
dumaine's
position
naturally,
the
d
&
h
board
reserves
its
right
to
reconsider
its
position
in
light
of
whatever
alternative
mr.
dumaine
may
come
up
with.
well,
now
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
this
saws
off
the
limb
that
the
district
court
claimed
on.
this
is
the
sort
of
embarrassment
that
was
inherent
all
along
in
the
district
court
upholding
an
order
on
the
ground
that
even
though
there
is
no
finding
to
support
erie
alone,
“don't
worry
about
it,
there's
going
to
be
a
stockholder
vote,
d
&
h
is
coming
in.
don't
worry
about
it”.
that
part
is,
there
never
was
any
reason
for
going
out
in
this
limb
because
d
&
h
stockholder
vote
could
have
been
required
on
a
couple
of
weeks
notice
any
time
during
this
period.
the
erie
had
theirs
in
august.
anything
inherent
in
this
suggests
that
d
&
h
didn't
want
to
take
the
vote.
now
of
course
d
&
h
still
wants
this
order
affirmed.
i
don't
want
this
--
i
don't
want
–-
be
misunderstood.
of
course
they
want
the
order
affirmed.
they
want
to
get
this
price
established,
put
a
floor
under
their
future
negotiation
with
penn-central
or
whatever
else
they
want
to
deal
with.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
answer
your
honor
in
two
parts,
first
place,
the
d
&
h
board
has
now
withdrawn.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
d
&
h
board
has
now
withdrawn
its
commitment
to
recommend
this
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
should
not
be
governed
by
that.
i
think
the
district
court
should
not
have
been
governed
by
that.
i
think
that
when
a
commission
order
is
unsupported
to
require
inclusion
of
erie
alone,
and
when
n
&
w
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
stockholder
votes
to
take
erie
alone,
that
that's
ground
for
setting
aside
the
order
and
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
tried
to
predict
based
on
the
representations
of
the
d
&
h
board
been
or
in
any
other
representations
as
to
how
the
stockholders
were
going
to
vote.
but
the
way
they
avoided
this
mess,
the
way
they
avoided
this
speculation
was
to
say
that
d
&
h
should
vote.
the
d
&
h
stockholders
haven't
voted
at
all,
just
that
the
board
has
recommend
it.
they
said
one
time
they
recommend
one
way
and
that
was
withdrawn
then.
they
should
have
made
the
d
&
h
stockholders
vote.
that
would
have
avoided
the
lower
court
having
to
have
rest
in
its
decision
on
its
guess
as
to
how
two
thirds
of
the
stockholders
would
have
voted
and
they
haven't
voted
yet.
they
haven't
voted
yet
and
speculation
on
my
part,
on
the
lower
courts
part,
and
on
anybody's
part
as
to
how
they
will
vote.
all
i
see
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
reason
this
letter
is
here
before
you
i
believe
sir
is
that
the
district
court
improperly
in
my
view
having
relied
upon
some
resolutions
of
the
board
of
directors,
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
that
reservation
--
basis
of
that
recommendation
and
bear
in
mind
this
is
at
the
critical
point
where
the
court
said,
“we
will
not
reverse
because
the
d
&
h
board
did
such
and
such”.
we
think
that
was
improper.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
am
now
arguing
on
the
premise
which
--
and
i
attack
the
d
&
h
price
is
too
high,
i
think
it's
much
too
high.
but
let's
assume
the
price
was
equitable
for
inclusion
in
n
&
w.
the
erie
is
forced
in
n
&
w
on
the
premise
that
d
&
h
is
coming.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
diff
--
the
difference
i
suppose
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
court
is
here
reviewing
not
only
penn-central
but
the
d
--
the
inclusion
case,
the
validity
of
the
inclusion
order.
this
makes
the
difference
in
this
critical
sense.
the
order
requires
that
n
&
w
take
erie
all
by
itself.
if
everybody
says
go
away,
we
are
stuck
with
erie
alone.
there
is
--
are
no
findings
to
support
that
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
exactly.
there
are
no
findings
to
support
the
inclusion
of
erie
alone.
now,
why
did
the
district
court
say
that
it
would
uphold
this
order
in
the
lack
of
findings?
the
district
court
brought
in
the
prior
advice
from
this
same
board
of
directors
to
say
that
not
withstanding
the
lack
of
findings
as
to
erie.
and
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
we
would
reverse
on
that
ground
we
won't
do
it
because
the
d
&
h
board
has
voted
to
recommend
approval.
it's
the
district
court
that
relied
on
the
action
of
a
d
&
h
board
which
i
think
it
shouldn't
have
done,
but
which
it
did
six
separate
times
in
its
opinion
and
said
it
would
have
reversed
if
it
hadn't
have
done
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
now,
having
relied
on
that
foundation,
this
letter
pulls
the
foundation
right
out
from
under.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
exactly.
exactly
and
i
cite
pages
57,
59,
61
and
66,
67
as
expressively
and
explicitly
basing
their
decision
not
to
reverse
on
the
action
of
the
d
&
h
board,
action
which
is
now
been
pulled
right
out
from
under
that
opinion.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
comes
in
a
chain
reaction.
it's
the
erie,
that
we
sold
the
erie
as
a
part
of
a
package,
is
a
part
of
an
--
as
an
interdependent
road
as
part
of
a
package.
in
order
to
sell
us
the
erie,
they
had
to
produce
the
d
&
h
under
the
findings
and
analysis
of
the
district
court,
erie
alone
was
not
supported
by
finding.
so
it's
the
--
the
thing
at
issue
was
the
erie.
it's
the
erie
inclusion
that's
at
issue.
and
the
court
says,
“we
would
reverse
for
lack
of
findings
but
for
the
recommendation
of
the
d
&
h
board
that
d
&
h
is
coming,
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
getting
just
the
erie,
d
&
h
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
when
it
comes
to
exact
language,
i'll
read
the
sentence
your
honor.
“while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
that
d
&
h
also
were
not
included,
rejection
by
d
&
h's
stockholders
is
so
unlikely,
as
we
shall
later
show,
that
we
will
not
reverse
on
that
ground”.
and
the
--
as
we
shall
later
show
--
i'm
reading
from
page
61.
the
“as
we
shall
later
show”
comes
on
page
66
where
the
court
says,
“we
find
ourselves
unable
to
take
seriously
the
possibility
that
d
&
h
stockholders
will
reject
their
director's
unanimous
recommendation
to
accept
the
inclusion
terms”.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
are
saying
that
we
had
an
order
that
was
not
conditioned.
we're
stuck
with
the
order.
there's
no
condition
in
the
order.
but
it
was
unsupported
by
findings
as
to
taking
in
the
erie
alone
and
they
said
it
was
unsupported
by
findings.
we
would
reverse
on
that
ground,
but
for
the
fact,
you
don't
have
to
worry,
d
&
h
is
coming
anyway
and
how
do
we
know
because
the
d
&
h
board
just
voted
to
recommend
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
they
--
the
sentence
is
--
and
word
--
i'm
in
the
summarizing
paragraph.
while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
d
&
h
didn't
come,
in
other
words,
the
court
does
find
as
a
--
the
base
of
their
analysis
of
this
order
that
the
commission
made
no
finding
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
is
page
61
your
honor.
right
after
the
two
summarized
sentence.
there
is
no
doubt,
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
district
court
held
that
the
commission
had
made
no
finding
as
to
the
erie
situation.
and
then
it
says,
“we
will
not
reverse
because
d
&
h
is
coming
anyway,”
and
how
do
we
know,
because
their
board
voted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
here's
the
finding
they
made
and
it's
at
840
of
the
commission's
opinion.
this
is
the
finding
on
the
assumption
which
we
now
know
as
shaky
to
say
at
least
that
erie
and
d
&
h,
that's
the
question.
that
erie
and
d
&
h
are
coming
but
what
about
b
&
m.
this
is
the
commission's
whole
treatment
of
that
subject,
sole
treatment.
if
b
&
m
were
not
controlled
by
n
&
w,
but
remained
an
independent
carrier,
the
net
reduction
in
erie
and
d
&
h
annual
gross
rate
revenues
would
no
doubt
be
greater,
greater
than
we
found.
the
record
does
not
permit
any
reliable
estimate
of
the
increased
loss.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
reason
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
the
reason
as
i
see
it
is
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
it
said
in
that
instance
was
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
this
wouldn't
make
that
much
difference.
this
is
on
page
57
of
the
report.
even
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
and
that's
--
but
what
happened
there
was
that
the
district
court
and
now
you
have
the
solicitor
general
and
erie,
all
trying
to
supply
findings.
the
commission
found
that
the
loss
would
be
greater
and
that
the
record
wouldn't
permit
an
estimate
of
the
increased
loss.
now,
you've
got
the
district
court
and
the
solicitor
general
and
the
erie
and
d
&
h
as
a
matter
of
fact,
trying
to
have
this
court
as
they
have
the
district
court
make
findings
that
the
commission
refused
to
make.
now
this
--
the
complete
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
a
sentence
out
of
champlin
oil
case,
341
u.s.
301.
it's
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
de
novo
which
the
commission
itself
was
unable
or
unwilling
to
make.
now
they've
tried
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
where
the
commission
not
only
didn't
make
them
but
they
found
the
record
did
not
permit
them
to
be
made.
now,
where
it
also
attacked
that
n
&
w
didn't
put
in
the
evidence.
well,
n
&
w
agreed
with
the
evidence
and
the
commission's
finding
that
these
were
interdependent
roads.
why
should
we
be
impeaching
that
commission
finding?
these
people
are
not
--
the
package
having
been
broken,
these
people
are
now
trying
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
that
the
commission
didn't
make
and
on
a
subject
which
the
commission
said,
the
record
does
not
permit
any
reliable
estimate.
that's
the
situation
as
to
that
one
but
that's
--
and
that's
how
they
got
out
of
it,
if
you
--
they
got
out
of
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
--
what?
i
would
think
that
since
these
roads
were
trying
to
get
into
the
n
&
w
system,
they
have
the
burden
in
showing
what
their
value
was
to
the
n
&
w
system
and
the
commission
treated
that
on
the
premise
that
all
four
--
i
mean
all
four,
n
&
w
plus
the
three
would
be
a
package.
all
of
these
findings,
all
these
calculation,
all
these
prices
are
calculated
on
that
basis
because
--
and
why
do
they
do
it
there
because
they
are
economically
interdependent.
they
connect.
one
is
a
bridge
between
the
other
two.
we
agreed
with
that,
we
agreed
with
that.
if
you're
going
to
take
them
why
take
the
--
why
take
pieces
of
the
package.
so
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
our
burden
to
come
and
show
the
situation
as
to
particular
pieces
of
the
package.
we
did
put
in
evidence.
in
contrary
to
what
the
government
says,
n
&
w
is
the
one
that
put
in
what
the
commission
regard
as
a
careful
and
detailed
study
of
the
losses,
but
it
was
the
losses
of
the
package,
we
--
whether
we
have
the
burden
or
not,
we
did
it
as
a
package.
and
you
really
have
to
search
in
vain
in
support,
to
see
any
contemplatio
that
they're
going
to
break
this
package.
i
cite
the
sole
sentence
to
mr.
justice
white
but
that's
all
there
is
in
this
whole
report,
that
one
sentence
that
the
record
doesn't
permit.
i
also
want
to
add
one
comment
about
that
commission
finding.
it
starts
out,
if
b
&
m
were
not
controlled
by
n
&
w
but
remained
an
independent
carrier,
well,
that's
one
premise
that
i
don't
think
we
can
operate
under.
if
b
&
m
remained
an
independent
carrier,
that
all
reason
we're
all
here,
the
whole
reason
that
penn-central
creates
this
problem
is
a
finding
that
that
is
not
in
the
cards,
that
the
continued
the
operation
of
b
&
m
as
an
independent
carrier
is
out
of
the
question
foreclosed
by
penn-central.
now
the
district
court
ridiculed
our
worry,
that
all
--
well,
these
roads
may
drift
into
penn-central
and
penn-central
would
not
only
have
the
east
but
with
all
these
roads
besides.
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
that
this
concern
has
reality.
last
year,
the
central
new
jersey
argument
and
you
might
inquire
where
is
the
central
new
jersey
today,
well,
it
went
bankrupt.
and
don't
they
have
counsel?
yes,
they
have
counsel.
why
aren't
they
here?
the
reason
they're
here
is
that
they
made
an
agreement
with
penn-central.
the
eve
of
this
district
court
hearing
that
if
central
new
jersey
would
stay
out
of
this
case,
penn-central
would
agree
to
take
them
in.
penn-central
made
the
same
offer
to
reading
and
it's
that
availability
of
penn-central
as
a
home
that
keeps
these
folks
going
outside
of
n
&
w
knowing
that
they've
got
this
appendix
g
subsidy.
now
back
of
all
these,
you've
got
to
remember,
there's
this
appendix
g
pool
that
enables
these
stockholders
to
lose
all
their
traffic
and
not
be
concerned
about
it
because
they
are
protected
by
the
indemnity
pool
and
that's
what
permits
this
whole
thing
to
happen.
now,
i'd
to
like
to
close
by
simply
stating
that
last
term,
the
penn-central
case
has
held
that
that
merger
was
the
largest
railroad
merger
in
our
history
and
if
not
handled
properly,
it
could
seriously
disrupt
and
irreparably
injure
the
entire
railroad
ystem
in
the
northeast
section
of
the
country.
the
reason
that
i've
tried
to
outline
and
--
which
are
covered
in
our
brief,
we
don't
think
that
this
has
been
properly
handled
in
the
sense
that
the
commission's
action
is
arbitrary
and
unsupported
within
the
meaning
of
this
administrative
procedure
and
i
realize
that
the
commission
has
the
responsibility
for
administering
the
railroad
merger
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
realize
that
full
well
but
i
also
say
that
the
courts
have
their
responsibility
to
assure
that
the
administrative
action
complies
with
the
standards
of
the
statute
and
to
protect
against
arbitrary
action.
the
congress
has
directed
that
there
would
be
effective
judicial
review
and
we
believe
that
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
have
to
require
that
the
commission's
orders
in
this
case
be
set
aside.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we've
read
at
outset,
we
ought
to
make
it
plain
just
what
the
situation
is
on
this
right
to
petition
in
penn-central.
if
d
&
h
whether
misguided
or
correct
or
whatever
this
businessman's
views
are,
whether
sound
or
not,
d
&
h
turns
it
down
and
that
means
one
third
of
the
stock
either
doesn't
vote
at
all
or
votes
against
it.
if
that
happens,
boston
&
maine
has
the
absolute
right
to
petition
for
inclusion
into
penn-central.
so
this
penn-central
was
quite
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
--
it's
the
double
provision
of
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
in
penn-central
plus
the
conditions
in
the
inclusion
order.
yes
sir,
it's
a
combined
effect
of
those
two
orders.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
the
d
&
h
turns
it
down,
they
do
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
petition.
however,
as
in
the
case
of
cnj,
a
mutual
petition
by
penn-central
and
by
the
d
&
h,
yes,
and
of
course
it
was
said
that
the
--
oh,
d
&
h
was
never
thinking
of
that.
the
affidavit
in
the
district
court
which
was
in
this
record,
indicated
that
mr.
silleck
said
that
mr.
dumaine
had
in
mind
a
new
england
system.
in
addition
to
his
idea
of
making
the
d
&
h
part
of
a
new
england
system,
he
said
there
are
other
plans
that
d
&
h
might
consider.
he
said
that
possibly
d
&
h
should
become
part
of
the
merged
penn-central.
so
there,
they
have
that
very
much
in
mind.
now
i
agree
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
sure,
he
does.
he
wants
to
--
he
wants
this
price
fixed
so
that
he
can
go
and
try
and
do
better,
that's
the
claim
on
it.
now,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
hold
up
value,
(inaudible)
the
playoff
value,
the
shopping
around
value
is
bad.
i
agree
that
the
portions
of
the
commission
order
that
let
them
go
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
for
four
years
in
the
shop
around,
that's
bad.
and
the
solicitor
general
says,
he
has
sympathy
for
this
problem.
well,
we
don't
want
sympathy.
we
want
appendix
g
declared
unlawful
for
letting
this
happen
in
contrary
to
the
mandate
of
the
court.
what
appendix
g
does
today
is
cater
solely
to
the
private
interest.
the
private
interest
of
the
stockholders
as
contrasted
with
running
this
railroad
because
the
more
traffic
that's
taken
away
by
penn-central,
the
more
the
stockholder
interest
is
protected
without
regard
to
whether
the
railroad
has
the
traffic
to
compete
with
penn-central
or
not.
it's
because
appendix
g
has
no
function
other
than
to
subsidize
the
shopping
spree
that
it
causes
this
problem.
that's
the
evil
of
the
penn-central
order
as
it's
now
set
up.
now
last
term,
the
solicitor
general
said
in
response
to
this
very
indemnity
pool
that's
set
up,
to
give
the
three
smaller
roads
a
permanent
stay
in
the
financial
success
of
penn-central
would
be
almost
like
decreeing
their
affiliation
with
the
penn-central
system
and
thereby
giving
that
system
a
virtual
monopoly
in
new
england
and
new
york.
this
is
what
appendix
g
does,
puts
them
together.
it
puts
the
stockholders
in
the
financial
pool
with
penn-central.
it
doesn't
do
much
for
keeping
the
traffic
on
the
railroad,
of
course
not.
but
it
isn't
--
it
serves
only
to
protect
these
private
interests.
now
the
question
here
is
why
didn't
the
commission
do
what
we
all
expected
they
do?
to
determine
the
ultimate
faith,
determine.
can
you
get
in
penn-central
or
can't
you?
not
leave
this
thing
to
negotiations
and
petitions
and
all.
i
want
this
court
to
know
that
since
we
were
here
last,
i
have
asked
in
both
proceedings
and
these
proceedings
went
separately
before
the
commission.
i
asked
them
in
the
inclusion
case,
decide
the
faith,
decide
the
--
to
foreclose
penn-central.
i
asked
in
the
penn-central
case,
decide
this.
in
the
penn
--
in
the
inclusion
case,
i
got
this
show,
i
said,
“oh
that's
not
an
issue
here.
we're
just
talking
about
n
&
w”.
in
the
penn-central
case,
i
got
silenced.
this
ship
just
passed
the
night.
this
wouldn't
decide
the
ultimate
faith
of
these
roads.
it's
not
enough
to
just
provide
an
opportunity.
come
on
in
on
these
terms
if
you'd
like
to
come.
they
should've
decided
the
faith
of
these
roads.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
how
do
they
do
that?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
decide
now
that
it's
going
to
be
--
well,
here
are
the
choices.
there
weren't
that
many
choices.
they
could
come
into
n
&
w.
either
n
&
w
or
n
&
w
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
decided
they
could
come
in.
they
decided
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
can
decide
that
you
--
that
penn-central
is
out
for
you
folks.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
had
done
that
plus
deciding
that
they
wouldn't
be
subsidized
to
the
injury
of
the
other
eastern
railroads
during
this
long
period.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
had
decided
that
penn-central
should
be
foreclosed
and
if
they
have
decided
the
form
in
which
the
n
&
w
ought
to
take
--
to
carry
these
roads
and
bear
in
mind
that
with
this
million
and
eight
of
operating
savings
which
is
peanuts
in
this
business,
there
are
great
opportunities
to
make
erie
a
viable
system
in
another
form
of
n
&
w.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we're
a
victim.
we're
not
a
party
to
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we're
a
victim.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
go
one
place
to
the
other
and
i
would
hope
they
would
go
to
a
deep
place,
the
ultimate
faith
that
this
court
expected
the
commission
would
decide
for
them
in
which
the
commission
keep
saying,
“well,
that's
something
we're
going
to
look
at
tomorrow
or
we're
going
to
see
some
more
petitions.
we
won't
get
to
the
ultimate
faith”.
on
closing,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
it's
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
administer
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
i
fairly
agree
with
that.
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
see
if
an
order
is
supported.
and
if
it's
found
that
the
order
is
not
supported
as
the
district
court
found
in
the
inclusion
case,
the
function
of
the
court
is
to
set
the
order
aside.
that's
--
it
was
the
district
court
that
failed
to
do
that
part
of
the
judicial
function.
it
looked
at
what
the
d
&
h
board
might
or
might
not
do
and
that's
one
of
the
basic
problems
we
have
here
today.
now
just
one
comment
on
the
boston
--
on
the
new
haven
situation,
these
losses,
i
think
one
footnote
should
be
added
to
the
practical
situation
on
the
new
haven.
it's
true
that
when
it's
included
in
the
penn-central
system,
it
maybe
as
that
segment
of
the
railroad
are
losing
proposition
still,
i
don't
know.
well,
i
do
know
that
erie-lackawanna
interchanges
a
100,000
cars
a
year
with
the
new
haven
right
across
the
hudson
river
and
the
penn-central
when
they
get
the
new
haven
will
have
the
opportunity
for
the
long
hall
to
chicago
or
wherever
its
going
of
those
--
any
part
of
that
100,000
cars
of
the
present
new
haven-erie
traffic.
that's
the
kind
of
practical
situation
where
new
haven
will
benefit
--
where
penn-central
benefit.
not
merely
by
getting
the
new
haven
as
a
separate
short
hall
operation
but
that's
the
kind
of
situation
where
the
penn-central
will
be
able
to
injure
and
then
as
the
commission
found
kill
the
erie.
that's
the
factual
situation
that
causes
that
and
that's
why
erie
can't
live
as
an
independent
railroad.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
been
assigned
50
minutes
and
i
hope
to
save
a
few
moments
for
reply.
last
term,
the
court
held
the
penn-central
merger
should
not
be
consummated
until
the
ultimate
thing,
the
three
railroads
had
--
have
been
determined.
the
court
stated
that
this
meant
a
decision
on
the
inclusion
of
these
three
railroads
in
a
major
system
prior
to
the
consummation
of
penn-central
merger.
but
the
underlying
reason
for
that
holding
was
the
economic
fact
that
penn-central
merger
will
destroy
three
other
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
&
hudson,
boston
&
maine.
the
commission
expressly
found
that
this
would
happen
and
since
the
case
was
before
this
court,
that
finding
has
not
been
modified
and
has
not
been
challenged
by
any
party.
now,
the
commission
has
held
that
penn-central
can
be
consummated
and
why,
because
the
commission
has
issued
an
order
in
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case.
the
commission's
order
directs
norfolk
&
western
to
pay
out
some
$130
million
in
stock
and
cash
to
acquire
the
equity
ownership,
not
the
properties
but
the
equity
ownership
of
these
three
railroads
and
to
include
them
as
separate
subsidiary
corporations
in
the
n
&
w
system.
now
the
reason
for
the
form
of
this
order,
i'm
giving
erie
as
an
example,
is
that
n
&
w
is
required
to
buy
the
stock
of
erie.
it's
not
merged
and
it's
not
integrated
completely
because
merger
was
out
of
the
question.as
the
commission
found,
merger
was
nowhere
in
sight.
the
reason
it's
nowhere
in
sight
is
that
erie
had
$350
million
of
debt.
everybody
recognized
that
that
made
merger
out
of
question,
and
the
reason
of
course
was
that
erie
bondholders
who
are
appellants
in
this
court
refused
to
do
anything
to
modify
that
bond
for
that
debt
and
they
said
they'd
rather
have
erie
go
bankrupt
than
modify
the
debt.
and
so,
we
have
these
corporations.
n
&
w
acquires
their
stock
by
going
into
n
&
w
subsidiary
corporation,
separate
corporations
and
if
they
fail
to
meet
their
fixed
charges
individually,
they
can
go
into
bankruptcy.
it's
essential
to
us
--
compare
what
this
order
does
for
erie
stockholders
but
what
it
does
for
the
erie
corporation
upon
whom
the
commission
relies
to
provide
necessary
transportation
service.
now
why
is
it
that
n
&
w
is
required
to
buy
the
stock
of
erie
for
example.
here
is
the
public
interest
finding
and
i
think
it's
critical
to
read
this
because
the
district
court
completely
ignored
its
existence.
i
can
read
the
district
court
opinion
through
and
never
know
this
finding
occurred
but
this
is
why
in
the
public
interest,
n
&
w
was
required
to
buy
this
stock,
because
it
included
--
if
erie
is
included
in
n
&
w
by
way
of
control,
control
meaning
we
buy
the
stock.
these
roads
would
be
able
to
continue
to
provide
adequate
transportation
service
and
why
is
that?
because
and
only
because
of
this
express
finding,
the
normal
earnings
of
each
petitioner,
the
normal
earnings
of
each
petitioner
after
inclusion
will
be
sufficient
to
meet
their
fixed
charges.
these
normal
earnings
concept
and
these
normal
earnings
findings
are
critical
not
only
to
the
price
we
had
to
pay.
price
was
geared
to
these
normal
earnings.
but
it
was
also
critical
and
underlies
the
commission's
sole
public
interest
finding
as
to
why
n
&
w
had
to
acquire
the
stock.
and
so
i
begin
by
describing
how
the
commission
found
and
arrived
at
the
so-called
normal
earnings
of
erie
railroad.
erie
had
a
deficit
of
$8
million
in
1964.
it
had
deficits
every
year
for
years
prior
there
to.
1965
and
1966,
erie
reported
net
income
averaging
$5
million,
deficits
and
net
income
1965-1966.
the
commission
took
that
$5
million
of
net
income
in
those
two
years.
it
added
$4.5
million
which
represented
a
subsidy
that
the
new
jersey
state
was
expected
to
and
did
commit
itself
to
pay
erie
to
continue
to
run
erie's
--
erie
commuter
service
and
a
subsidy
in
the
amount
of
$4.5
million
a
year
additional
subsidy.
$5
million
that
they
made
in
these
two
years
plus
the
$4.5
million,
that's
$9.5
million
of
normal
earnings.
now
bear
in
mind,
this
isn't
a
guess
into
the
farthest
in
future.
this
is
a
finding
that
erie
had
achieved
normal
earnings
of
$9.5
million
by
the
end
of
1966.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
and
i
don't
regard
that
if
i
have
to
buy
a
corporation
that's
supposed
to
be
earning
$9.5
million,
i
think
the
fact
that
$4.5
million
is
a
subsidy
dependent
on
year-to-year
appropriations
of
a
legislature
makes
that
a
far
different
character
of
earnings,
but
that's
what
part
it
is.
that's
$4.5
million
of
the
$9.5
million
is
the
subsidy.
now,
these
past
deficits
were
disregarded
by
the
commission
and
passed
aside
on
the
ground
that
erie's
new
management
had
achieved
a
sensational
turnaround.
a
sensational
turnaround
from
all
of
these
deficits
now
we're
earning
$5
million
and
we're
going
to
get
this
subsidy,
so
it's
a
corporation
that's
going
to
earn
$9.5
million
a
year,
and
that's
what
n
&
w
was
sold.
well,
it's
been
some
turnaround.
it's
been
a
complete
circle
starting
with
this
deficit
of
$8
million
in
1964,
erie
came
up
and
earned
an
average
of
$5
million
for
1965-1966.
but
this
year,
erie
is
losing
money,
it's
backed
the
deficits
to
the
tune
of
$10
million
a
year.
for
the
first
nine
months
of
1967,
erie
lost
$7.7
million,
so
it's
now
in
this
year
losing
money,
tuned
about
$10
million
a
year,
that's
what
its
normal
situation
is
now
and
this
has
been
perfectly
apparent
since
early
1967
long
before
the
commission
decided
this
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
they
--
this
reflects
the
realization
of
the
subsidy
they
found
would
occur
so
10
million
is
lost
despite
receiving
that
additional
subsidy.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
that's
my
--
that's
what
we've
been
told.
now
i
realize
that
this
function
of
predicting
the
future
is
a
matter
for
experts
and
i
know
that
when
the
weatherman
says
that
it's
going
to
be
a
sunny
day
tomorrow,
there's
no
way
i
can
dispute
that,
i
have
to
leave
that
to
experts.
but
when
the
commission's
finding
of
$9.5
million
of
erie's
earnings
is
involved,
we
have
to
remember
that
this
was
not
what's
going
to
happen
tomorrow.
this
was
a
finding
that
they
had
realized
9.5
million
of
earnings.
and
this
is
the
like
the
weatherman
saying
it's
going
to
be
a
sunny
day
all
day
today
and
failing
or
refusing
to
look
out
the
window
to
see
it's
already
raining.
now,
an
erroneous
prediction
under
such
circumstances
isn't
a
prediction
at
all
and
it's
not
a
mere
error
by
some
presumed
foreseer.
this
is
an
arbitrary
action,
arbitrary
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure.
to
act
on
the
premise
that
erie
has
already
achieved
normal
earnings
of
9.5
million,
when
after
receiving
the
subsidy,
erie
is
operating
at
a
normal
deficit,
back
to
the
deficit.
now
this
becomes
especially
arbitrary
when
the
same
weatherman
looked
out
the
window
in
the
penn-central
case
being
decided
at
the
same
time
and
he
found
that
it
was
raining
on
penn-central.
the
commission
in
the
penn-central
case
decided
the
same
time,
refused
to
regard
1965
and
1966
earnings
as
represented
in
approving
penn-central.
and
the
commission
placed
great
reliance
on
the
1967
reports
which
were
before
showing
that
there
had
been
a
decline
in
penn-central
earnings.
not
a
decline
so
that
their
aggregate
was
down
to
a
deficit
but
a
decline
and
they
rely
on
that
to
support
their
approval
of
penn-central.
so
i
say
it's
doubly
arbitrary
when
this
weatherman
will
look
at
the
window
to
see
it's
raining
on
penn-central
but
still
finds
the
theory,
its
normal
earnings
in
$9.5
million
was
perfectly
apparent
to
anybody
to
look
outside
that
it
is
just
isn't
so.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
to
the
penn-central
merger
itself,
we'd
take
the
position
that
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
until
a
--
the
ultimate
faith
of
these
three
railroads
has
been
determined.
the
penn-central
shall
not
be
consummated
so
that
--
i'm
now
talking
about
the
inclusion
case,
i
believe
the
inclusion
case
will
reverse
penn-central
has
to
wait
till
they
straighten
this
up.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
independently
of
that
i
say
your
honor
that
if
penn
--
if
the
inclusion
case
were
affirmed
that
the
situation
is
now
such
that
we
know
and
allow
--
i
shall
demonstrate
it
as
i
get
along
that
the
affirmance
of
the
inclusion
case
will
not
satisfy
the
mandate
of
the
court.
even
if
that's
affirmed,
the
penn-central
case
mandate
has
not
been
satisfied
because
at
least
two
of
these
roads
and
probably
the
erie
as
well,
the
way
it's
set
up,
will
not
have
their
faith
determined.
you
just
won't
know.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
if
by
the
merits
your
honor,
you
mean
whether
we
think
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
such,
no
sir.
no
sir,
we
objected
the
merger,
the
condition
--
we
do
not
object
to
the
merger
itself.
we
do
object
to
the
appendix
g
conditions
attached
to
it
and
what
they
do
to
the
effort
of
other
roads
to
survive,
so
as
conditions
and
the
effort
to
solve
this
problem,
a
problem
created
by
penn-central.
it
that
can
be
so
we
--
we
think
the
benefits
of
penn-central
in
terms
of
efficiencies
should
be
realized.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
power
to
issue
an
order
directing
them
to
do
it?
no
sir,
no
sir.
and
i
must
say
that
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
read
it,
the
motion
to
affirm
rest
on
that
but
it's
sort
of
attitude
--
well,
don't
shoot
the
piano
player,
he
is
doing
the
best
he
can
with
this
kind
of
a
power
that
they
had,
this
limited
power
they
have.
now
the
problem
though,
we
don't
think
risk
on
the
commission's
lack
of
power.
the
problem
is,
what
did
they
do?
the
shambles
that
exist
today
and
i
don't
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
exactly
correct.
however,
there
is
one
factor
that
makes
that
unrealistic
from
the
commissions
point
of
view
and
that
is
the
they've
found
that
b
&
m
cannot
do
it
alone.
the
finding
is
that
they
can't
survive
as
an
independent
railroad.
so
that
alternative
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
economic
impact
of
penn-central.
so
they
can't
do
it
alone.
why
then
do
they
not
leave
the
first
home
that's
found
for
them?
and
the
reason
is
not
the
commission's
lack
of
power.
the
reason
in,
what
the
commission
did
do,
this
--
allowing
this
appendix
g
subsidy
to
enable
these
roads
to
shop
around
for
inclusion
in
penn-central
and
they're
worth
more
to
penn-central
but
it's
this
appendix
g
that
creates
an
artificial
climate
that
enables
these
roads
to
do
that.
it's
that
exercise
of
commission's
power
and
not
its
lack
of
power
that
causes
this
problem.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
have
the
opportunity
to
come
into
n
&
w
on
terms
that
are
not
only
fair
but
i
regard
as
generous
to
the
excess.
but
the
reason
they
don't
want
to
come
in
is
that
they
are
worth
more
to
penn-central.
after
all,
they
provide
the
elimination
of
rail
competition
in
new
england.
they
provide
a
savings
that
we
can't
provide
with
them.
they
are
worth
more
to
penn-central
and
what
has
given
them
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
shop
for
that
situation
and
to
get
more
money
out
of
this
is
two
for
one,
the
commission's
failure
to
determine
the
ultimate
faith.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
decide,
it's
got
to
be
n
&
w
and
not
penn-central.
they
refused
to
do
that
although
i
asked
them
to.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
i
think,
it's
--
it
said
that
till
they
found
the
--
that
for
--
finally
decided
the
ultimate
faith
namely
a
home
in
a
major
system.
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
it's
what
it
says.
and
it's
this
--
it's
the
commission's
failure
to
do
that.
it's
the
commission's
failure
to
find
that
it
ought
to
be
n
&
w
and
not
penn-central
that
lets
them
shop
around
with
a
subsidy
to
pay
the
stockholders.
now
bear
in
mind
this
appendix
g
subsidy
operates
for
the
benefit
of
the
stockholders.
if
the
re
--
traffic
can
just
all
vanish,
penn-central
can
take
all
their
traffic
and
under
this
condition,
the
stockholders
of
b
&
m
can
just
shop
to
their
heart's
delight
for
a
better
price.
this
is
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
would
have.
we
would
have
objected
that
they're
going
into
penn-central
was
not
in
the
interest
of
either
the
public
or
the
remaining
railroads.
but
the
commission,
by
not
deciding
that
one
way
or
the
other
has
left
these
railroads
in
a
position
where
they
can
start
getting
in
this
indemnity
pool
at
penn-central
where
they
can
keep
shopping
to
get
into
penn-central
and
they
can
in
effect
frustrate
this
commission
inclusion
order
which
they
have
done.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
one
road
has
voted
to
accept,
yes
sir,
one
road.
now
when
it
came
to
n
&
w
inclusion
case
and
--
we
are
the
ones
who
are
being
asked
to
give
130
million
for
these
railroads.
when
it
came
to
the
n
&
w
inclusion
case
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
agreed
in
advance
to
do
it
on
equitable
terms
and
i'm
--
i
will
say
to
this
court
that
if
erie
was
a
railroad
earning
10
million
a
year,
the
price
is
right.
we
are
not
here
challenging
the
price
if
in
fact
we
are
buying
a
railroad
with
normal
earnings
of
10
million
a
year
but
we're
not.
everybody
knows
we're
not.
you
can
look
outside
and
see
we're
not.
the
district
court
avoided
this
whole
question
by
saying,
“well,
n
&
w
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
the
price
because
they
get
tax
deductions”.
n
&
w
gets
tax
deduction
so
they're
protecting
their
money.
all
--
in
fact
the
more
money
erie
losses,
the
more
we
get
to
deduct
from
our
consolidated
tax
return
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
as
much
tax
out
of
n
&
w
income,
and
in
effect,
the
u.s.
treasury
is
protecting
us
in
our
payment
to
erie
stockholders.
so
judge
friendly
said,
“well
that
cushion
is
to
blow
on
you”.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
don't
think
when
we
get
a
--
or
sold
a
$10
million
profit
making
company
and
it
turns
out
it's
losing
$10
million,
that
that's
fair
to
n
&
w
without
regard
to
these
tax
scheme.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
even
begin
to
satisfy
the
whole
public
interest
notion
of
this
case
that
the
reason
it's
alright
to
put
erie
and
n
&
w
and
the
reason
it
will
survive
penn-central
is
that
it's
a
profitable
company
making
$10
million
a
year
that
will
stay
out
of
bankruptcy.
we
now
know
that
isn't
so,
we
know
it
isn't
so
before
penn-central
hits
even,
and
yet
the
district
court
opinion
in
this
doesn't
even
face
up
to
the
sole
public
interest
reason
for
forcing
these
railroads
down
to
n
&
w's
unwilling
throat.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
to
erie's
management,
to
erie
stockholders,
they'll
get
a
great
benefit.
they'll
get
paid
as
though
they
are
corporation
or
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
income,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
operating
economies
found
a
total,
a
million
eight,
1.8
million
a
year.
that's
the
magnitude
of
the
operating
economies
found
to
accrue
from
this
kind
of
arrangement
for
railroad
already
earning
10
million
a
year
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
losing
10
million
a
year.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
bear
in
mind,
this
is
all
before
penn-central
hits.
this
is
before
the
impact
of
penn-central.
and
as
our
brief
show,
the
commission
tried
to
say
that
wouldn't
--
well,
it
will
hurt
erie
to
the
tune
of
11
million,
that
wouldn't
--
could
be
offset
by
some
things
that
would
benefit
n
&
w
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
for
that,
the
brief
show
why
that
is
and
the
reason
is
that
erie
never
claimed,
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
notion.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
a
completely
different
point
and
i
say
this
is
completely
different
and
to
emphasize
it,
i
want
to
now
argue
on
the
premise.
totally
wrong
i
believe,
but
the
premise
that
everything
the
commission
did
as
to
all
three
railroads
was
right.
everything
as
to
all
three
was
right.
earnings
there,
everything
they
found
was
true.
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
there
is
a
separate
issue
because
they
sold
these
railroads
to
n
&
w
as
a
package.
both
the
public
interest
findings
as
to
what
they'd
earned
and
the
prices
all
assume
that
all
three
of
these
railroads
are
coming
in
as
a
package
and
this
is
critically
important
because
these
three
railroads
don't
go
off
in
all
different
direction
from
n
&
w.
they
are
economically
interdependent.
interdependent
is
the
finding
of
the
commission.
and
erie
obviously
depends
on
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
for
much
of
its
traffic.
d
&
h's
primary
function
in
life
is
to
serve
as
a
bridge
between
b
&
m
and
erie.
the
commission's
public
interest
finding
assumes
inclusion
of
all
three
but
the
price
is
calculated
on
the
basis
of
all
three.
and
this
was
a
four-way
control
they
call
it.
now,
there's
no
suggestion
of
this
court
that
b
&
m's
coming
into
the
n
&
w
under
this
inclusion
order.
now
the
thing
that
is
remarkable
is
that
this
whole
district
court
opinion
is
constructed
on
the
premise,
the
guess
of
the
district
court
that
d
&
h
was
coming.
now
why
is
that
critical?
the
reason
it's
critical
is
that
what
happens
here
really
is
that
n
&
w
was
faced
with
an
order
that
is
a
practical
matter
requires
us
to
pick
up
erie
alone.
that's
really
what
this
order
does.
it
doesn't
take
care
of
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
because
they're
going
the
other
way.
it
requires
us
to
take
erie
who's
had
this
precipitous
decline
in
its
earnings.
there
is
no
finding
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
as
much
as
i
can,
there
is
no
finding
to
support
the
inclusion
of
erie
alone
in
n
&
w.
the
district
--
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
reanalyze
all
the
commission
opinions
and
take
my
word,
there's
no
finding
because
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
finding.
i'm
going
to
read
the
critical
sentence
of
judge
friendly's
opinion.
“while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
that
d
&
h
also
were
not
included,
rejection
by
d
&
h's
stockholders
is
so
unlikely”,
as
we
shall
later
show,
“that
we
will
not
reverse
on
that
ground,
no
finding
to
support
erie
alone,
but
don't
worry
about
it,
that's
not
a
practical
problem
because
d
&
h
is
coming”.
now
this
is
something
that
the
district
court
says
six
separate
times
in
its
opinion.
we
won't
reverse
on
this
ground
because
erie
--
d
&
h
stockholders
are
so
unlikely
to
reject,
not
even
a
serious
possibility.
the
court
says
that
this
is
not
a
hypothesis,
even
have
a
reality.
we
cannot
take
the
prospect
of
non-inclusion
of
d
&
h
at
all
seriously.
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
take
seriously
the
possibility
that
d
&
h
stockholders
will
reject
their
directors'
unanimous
recommendation
to
accept
the
inclusion
term.
it
just
isn't
a
practical
possibility
and
therefore,
we
can
forget
about
the
concern
of
n
&
w
that
here,
they
had
an
order,
that's
a
package
and
they're
going
to
take
erie
alone
because
d
&
h
is
coming
so
found
by
the
district
court.
it's
on
this
basis
that
the
order
is
affirmed
even
though
it
didn't
have
the
finding
to
support
inclusion
of
erie
alone.
now
this
leaves
n
&
w
holding
the
bag
as
it
were.
what
if
the
d
--
district
court
guessed
wrong,
we're
still
stuck
with
the
owner.
they
affirmed
it.
we
get
stuck
with
buying
the
interdependent
erie
at
the
same
price.
no
public
interest
finding
in
including
erie
alone.
district
court
holding,
there
aren't
sufficient
findings
but
we're
stuck
with
the
order.
and
where
--
we
were
simply
not
saying
one
about
the
d
&
h
vote
because
we
knew
that
it
took
a
two
thirds
affirmative
vote
of
d
&
h
to
come
in.
we
knew
that
d
&
h's
principal
stockholder
who
also
happens
to
be
its
president
had
refused
to
say
how
he
is
going
to
vote.
now
we
said
that
to
this
court
in
our
papers,
the
solicitor
general
called
our
fears
“mere
speculation”
based
entirely
upon
a
statement
of
d
&
h's
president
made
before,
italicized
before
the
d
&
h
board
of
directors
unanimously
voted
to
recommend
to
the
stockholders
that
inclusion
terms
would
be
accepted.
so
the
erie
comes
along,
the
erie
whose
loan
inclusion
in
n
&
w
is
unsupported
by
findings
as
held
by
the
district
court
and
they
also
ridicule
our
concern.
here's
what
erie
had
to
say
last
monday
in
their
motion
to
affirm.
n
&
w's
speculation
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
may
after
all
this
time
and
effort
elect
not
to
become
part
of
n
&
w
appears
highly
exaggerated.
the
inclusion
of
d
&
h
in
n
&
w
is
assured,
assured.
d
&
h
does
not
challenge
the
terms
fixed
by
the
commission.
its
board
of
directors
has
voted
unanimously
to
recommend
to
its
stockholders
acceptance
of
the
terms
proposed
by
the
commission.
well,
that
was
last
monday.
we
received
saturday
morning
a
letter
addressed
to
this
court
from
counsel
for
d
&
h
who
had
told
the
district
court
upon
whose
--
district
court
relied
that
the
d
&
h
board
had
unanimously
voted
to
recommend
these
terms.
here
is
the
letter
to
the
honorable
sirs.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
is
from
counsel
for
d
&
h
to
the
court.
first
paragraph
as
set
forth
by
the
undersigned
counsel
to
the
district
court,
the
d
&
h
board
of
directors
voted
on
september
26
to
recommend
approval
of
the
terms
provided
the
commission's
orders
are
held
by
the
court.
on
november
29th,
1967,
mr.
f.c.
dumaine
jr.,
a
member
of
the
d
&
h
board
advised
that
board
that
he
is
in
the
process
of
formulating
an
alternative
proposal
for
d
&
h's
future
and
that
he
would
not
vote
to
recommend
the
n
&
w
inclusion
terms
if
when
they
are
submitted
to
d
&
h
stockholders,
he
is
in
a
position
to
recommend
an
alternative
which
in
his
judgment
is
in
the
better
interest
of
the
stockholders.
now
this
mr.
dumaine
deserves
an
introduction.
he
is
more
than
a
member
of
the
board.
he
is
by
far
d
&
h's
largest
stockholder.
he
owns
over
11-12%
of
their
total
stock
and
he's
eight
times
larger
than
anybody
else
in
the
board
or
owners.
he
happens
to
be
their
president
and
this
is
where
we
stand
today.
the
closing
paragraph
of
counsel's
letter
says
that
in
view
of
mr.
dumaine's
position
naturally,
the
d
&
h
board
reserves
its
right
to
reconsider
its
position
in
light
of
whatever
alternative
mr.
dumaine
may
come
up
with.
well,
now
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
this
saws
off
the
limb
that
the
district
court
claimed
on.
this
is
the
sort
of
embarrassment
that
was
inherent
all
along
in
the
district
court
upholding
an
order
on
the
ground
that
even
though
there
is
no
finding
to
support
erie
alone,
“don't
worry
about
it,
there's
going
to
be
a
stockholder
vote,
d
&
h
is
coming
in.
don't
worry
about
it”.
that
part
is,
there
never
was
any
reason
for
going
out
in
this
limb
because
d
&
h
stockholder
vote
could
have
been
required
on
a
couple
of
weeks
notice
any
time
during
this
period.
the
erie
had
theirs
in
august.
anything
inherent
in
this
suggests
that
d
&
h
didn't
want
to
take
the
vote.
now
of
course
d
&
h
still
wants
this
order
affirmed.
i
don't
want
this
--
i
don't
want
–-
be
misunderstood.
of
course
they
want
the
order
affirmed.
they
want
to
get
this
price
established,
put
a
floor
under
their
future
negotiation
with
penn-central
or
whatever
else
they
want
to
deal
with.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
answer
your
honor
in
two
parts,
first
place,
the
d
&
h
board
has
now
withdrawn.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
d
&
h
board
has
now
withdrawn
its
commitment
to
recommend
this
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
should
not
be
governed
by
that.
i
think
the
district
court
should
not
have
been
governed
by
that.
i
think
that
when
a
commission
order
is
unsupported
to
require
inclusion
of
erie
alone,
and
when
n
&
w
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
stockholder
votes
to
take
erie
alone,
that
that's
ground
for
setting
aside
the
order
and
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
tried
to
predict
based
on
the
representations
of
the
d
&
h
board
been
or
in
any
other
representations
as
to
how
the
stockholders
were
going
to
vote.
but
the
way
they
avoided
this
mess,
the
way
they
avoided
this
speculation
was
to
say
that
d
&
h
should
vote.
the
d
&
h
stockholders
haven't
voted
at
all,
just
that
the
board
has
recommend
it.
they
said
one
time
they
recommend
one
way
and
that
was
withdrawn
then.
they
should
have
made
the
d
&
h
stockholders
vote.
that
would
have
avoided
the
lower
court
having
to
have
rest
in
its
decision
on
its
guess
as
to
how
two
thirds
of
the
stockholders
would
have
voted
and
they
haven't
voted
yet.
they
haven't
voted
yet
and
speculation
on
my
part,
on
the
lower
courts
part,
and
on
anybody's
part
as
to
how
they
will
vote.
all
i
see
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
reason
this
letter
is
here
before
you
i
believe
sir
is
that
the
district
court
improperly
in
my
view
having
relied
upon
some
resolutions
of
the
board
of
directors,
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
that
reservation
--
basis
of
that
recommendation
and
bear
in
mind
this
is
at
the
critical
point
where
the
court
said,
“we
will
not
reverse
because
the
d
&
h
board
did
such
and
such”.
we
think
that
was
improper.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
am
now
arguing
on
the
premise
which
--
and
i
attack
the
d
&
h
price
is
too
high,
i
think
it's
much
too
high.
but
let's
assume
the
price
was
equitable
for
inclusion
in
n
&
w.
the
erie
is
forced
in
n
&
w
on
the
premise
that
d
&
h
is
coming.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
diff
--
the
difference
i
suppose
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
court
is
here
reviewing
not
only
penn-central
but
the
d
--
the
inclusion
case,
the
validity
of
the
inclusion
order.
this
makes
the
difference
in
this
critical
sense.
the
order
requires
that
n
&
w
take
erie
all
by
itself.
if
everybody
says
go
away,
we
are
stuck
with
erie
alone.
there
is
--
are
no
findings
to
support
that
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
exactly.
there
are
no
findings
to
support
the
inclusion
of
erie
alone.
now,
why
did
the
district
court
say
that
it
would
uphold
this
order
in
the
lack
of
findings?
the
district
court
brought
in
the
prior
advice
from
this
same
board
of
directors
to
say
that
not
withstanding
the
lack
of
findings
as
to
erie.
and
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
we
would
reverse
on
that
ground
we
won't
do
it
because
the
d
&
h
board
has
voted
to
recommend
approval.
it's
the
district
court
that
relied
on
the
action
of
a
d
&
h
board
which
i
think
it
shouldn't
have
done,
but
which
it
did
six
separate
times
in
its
opinion
and
said
it
would
have
reversed
if
it
hadn't
have
done
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
now,
having
relied
on
that
foundation,
this
letter
pulls
the
foundation
right
out
from
under.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
exactly.
exactly
and
i
cite
pages
57,
59,
61
and
66,
67
as
expressively
and
explicitly
basing
their
decision
not
to
reverse
on
the
action
of
the
d
&
h
board,
action
which
is
now
been
pulled
right
out
from
under
that
opinion.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
comes
in
a
chain
reaction.
it's
the
erie,
that
we
sold
the
erie
as
a
part
of
a
package,
is
a
part
of
an
--
as
an
interdependent
road
as
part
of
a
package.
in
order
to
sell
us
the
erie,
they
had
to
produce
the
d
&
h
under
the
findings
and
analysis
of
the
district
court,
erie
alone
was
not
supported
by
finding.
so
it's
the
--
the
thing
at
issue
was
the
erie.
it's
the
erie
inclusion
that's
at
issue.
and
the
court
says,
“we
would
reverse
for
lack
of
findings
but
for
the
recommendation
of
the
d
&
h
board
that
d
&
h
is
coming,
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
getting
just
the
erie,
d
&
h
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
when
it
comes
to
exact
language,
i'll
read
the
sentence
your
honor.
“while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
that
d
&
h
also
were
not
included,
rejection
by
d
&
h's
stockholders
is
so
unlikely,
as
we
shall
later
show,
that
we
will
not
reverse
on
that
ground”.
and
the
--
as
we
shall
later
show
--
i'm
reading
from
page
61.
the
“as
we
shall
later
show”
comes
on
page
66
where
the
court
says,
“we
find
ourselves
unable
to
take
seriously
the
possibility
that
d
&
h
stockholders
will
reject
their
director's
unanimous
recommendation
to
accept
the
inclusion
terms”.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
are
saying
that
we
had
an
order
that
was
not
conditioned.
we're
stuck
with
the
order.
there's
no
condition
in
the
order.
but
it
was
unsupported
by
findings
as
to
taking
in
the
erie
alone
and
they
said
it
was
unsupported
by
findings.
we
would
reverse
on
that
ground,
but
for
the
fact,
you
don't
have
to
worry,
d
&
h
is
coming
anyway
and
how
do
we
know
because
the
d
&
h
board
just
voted
to
recommend
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
they
--
the
sentence
is
--
and
word
--
i'm
in
the
summarizing
paragraph.
while
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
erie's
losses
in
the
event
d
&
h
didn't
come,
in
other
words,
the
court
does
find
as
a
--
the
base
of
their
analysis
of
this
order
that
the
commission
made
no
finding
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
is
page
61
your
honor.
right
after
the
two
summarized
sentence.
there
is
no
doubt,
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
district
court
held
that
the
commission
had
made
no
finding
as
to
the
erie
situation.
and
then
it
says,
“we
will
not
reverse
because
d
&
h
is
coming
anyway,”
and
how
do
we
know,
because
their
board
voted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
here's
the
finding
they
made
and
it's
at
840
of
the
commission's
opinion.
this
is
the
finding
on
the
assumption
which
we
now
know
as
shaky
to
say
at
least
that
erie
and
d
&
h,
that's
the
question.
that
erie
and
d
&
h
are
coming
but
what
about
b
&
m.
this
is
the
commission's
whole
treatment
of
that
subject,
sole
treatment.
if
b
&
m
were
not
controlled
by
n
&
w,
but
remained
an
independent
carrier,
the
net
reduction
in
erie
and
d
&
h
annual
gross
rate
revenues
would
no
doubt
be
greater,
greater
than
we
found.
the
record
does
not
permit
any
reliable
estimate
of
the
increased
loss.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
reason
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
the
reason
as
i
see
it
is
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
it
said
in
that
instance
was
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
this
wouldn't
make
that
much
difference.
this
is
on
page
57
of
the
report.
even
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
and
that's
--
but
what
happened
there
was
that
the
district
court
and
now
you
have
the
solicitor
general
and
erie,
all
trying
to
supply
findings.
the
commission
found
that
the
loss
would
be
greater
and
that
the
record
wouldn't
permit
an
estimate
of
the
increased
loss.
now,
you've
got
the
district
court
and
the
solicitor
general
and
the
erie
and
d
&
h
as
a
matter
of
fact,
trying
to
have
this
court
as
they
have
the
district
court
make
findings
that
the
commission
refused
to
make.
now
this
--
the
complete
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
a
sentence
out
of
champlin
oil
case,
341
u.s.
301.
it's
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
de
novo
which
the
commission
itself
was
unable
or
unwilling
to
make.
now
they've
tried
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
where
the
commission
not
only
didn't
make
them
but
they
found
the
record
did
not
permit
them
to
be
made.
now,
where
it
also
attacked
that
n
&
w
didn't
put
in
the
evidence.
well,
n
&
w
agreed
with
the
evidence
and
the
commission's
finding
that
these
were
interdependent
roads.
why
should
we
be
impeaching
that
commission
finding?
these
people
are
not
--
the
package
having
been
broken,
these
people
are
now
trying
to
rescue
the
commission
by
making
findings
that
the
commission
didn't
make
and
on
a
subject
which
the
commission
said,
the
record
does
not
permit
any
reliable
estimate.
that's
the
situation
as
to
that
one
but
that's
--
and
that's
how
they
got
out
of
it,
if
you
--
they
got
out
of
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
--
what?
i
would
think
that
since
these
roads
were
trying
to
get
into
the
n
&
w
system,
they
have
the
burden
in
showing
what
their
value
was
to
the
n
&
w
system
and
the
commission
treated
that
on
the
premise
that
all
four
--
i
mean
all
four,
n
&
w
plus
the
three
would
be
a
package.
all
of
these
findings,
all
these
calculation,
all
these
prices
are
calculated
on
that
basis
because
--
and
why
do
they
do
it
there
because
they
are
economically
interdependent.
they
connect.
one
is
a
bridge
between
the
other
two.
we
agreed
with
that,
we
agreed
with
that.
if
you're
going
to
take
them
why
take
the
--
why
take
pieces
of
the
package.
so
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
our
burden
to
come
and
show
the
situation
as
to
particular
pieces
of
the
package.
we
did
put
in
evidence.
in
contrary
to
what
the
government
says,
n
&
w
is
the
one
that
put
in
what
the
commission
regard
as
a
careful
and
detailed
study
of
the
losses,
but
it
was
the
losses
of
the
package,
we
--
whether
we
have
the
burden
or
not,
we
did
it
as
a
package.
and
you
really
have
to
search
in
vain
in
support,
to
see
any
contemplatio
that
they're
going
to
break
this
package.
i
cite
the
sole
sentence
to
mr.
justice
white
but
that's
all
there
is
in
this
whole
report,
that
one
sentence
that
the
record
doesn't
permit.
i
also
want
to
add
one
comment
about
that
commission
finding.
it
starts
out,
if
b
&
m
were
not
controlled
by
n
&
w
but
remained
an
independent
carrier,
well,
that's
one
premise
that
i
don't
think
we
can
operate
under.
if
b
&
m
remained
an
independent
carrier,
that
all
reason
we're
all
here,
the
whole
reason
that
penn-central
creates
this
problem
is
a
finding
that
that
is
not
in
the
cards,
that
the
continued
the
operation
of
b
&
m
as
an
independent
carrier
is
out
of
the
question
foreclosed
by
penn-central.
now
the
district
court
ridiculed
our
worry,
that
all
--
well,
these
roads
may
drift
into
penn-central
and
penn-central
would
not
only
have
the
east
but
with
all
these
roads
besides.
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
that
this
concern
has
reality.
last
year,
the
central
new
jersey
argument
and
you
might
inquire
where
is
the
central
new
jersey
today,
well,
it
went
bankrupt.
and
don't
they
have
counsel?
yes,
they
have
counsel.
why
aren't
they
here?
the
reason
they're
here
is
that
they
made
an
agreement
with
penn-central.
the
eve
of
this
district
court
hearing
that
if
central
new
jersey
would
stay
out
of
this
case,
penn-central
would
agree
to
take
them
in.
penn-central
made
the
same
offer
to
reading
and
it's
that
availability
of
penn-central
as
a
home
that
keeps
these
folks
going
outside
of
n
&
w
knowing
that
they've
got
this
appendix
g
subsidy.
now
back
of
all
these,
you've
got
to
remember,
there's
this
appendix
g
pool
that
enables
these
stockholders
to
lose
all
their
traffic
and
not
be
concerned
about
it
because
they
are
protected
by
the
indemnity
pool
and
that's
what
permits
this
whole
thing
to
happen.
now,
i'd
to
like
to
close
by
simply
stating
that
last
term,
the
penn-central
case
has
held
that
that
merger
was
the
largest
railroad
merger
in
our
history
and
if
not
handled
properly,
it
could
seriously
disrupt
and
irreparably
injure
the
entire
railroad
ystem
in
the
northeast
section
of
the
country.
the
reason
that
i've
tried
to
outline
and
--
which
are
covered
in
our
brief,
we
don't
think
that
this
has
been
properly
handled
in
the
sense
that
the
commission's
action
is
arbitrary
and
unsupported
within
the
meaning
of
this
administrative
procedure
and
i
realize
that
the
commission
has
the
responsibility
for
administering
the
railroad
merger
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
realize
that
full
well
but
i
also
say
that
the
courts
have
their
responsibility
to
assure
that
the
administrative
action
complies
with
the
standards
of
the
statute
and
to
protect
against
arbitrary
action.
the
congress
has
directed
that
there
would
be
effective
judicial
review
and
we
believe
that
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
have
to
require
that
the
commission's
orders
in
this
case
be
set
aside.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we've
read
at
outset,
we
ought
to
make
it
plain
just
what
the
situation
is
on
this
right
to
petition
in
penn-central.
if
d
&
h
whether
misguided
or
correct
or
whatever
this
businessman's
views
are,
whether
sound
or
not,
d
&
h
turns
it
down
and
that
means
one
third
of
the
stock
either
doesn't
vote
at
all
or
votes
against
it.
if
that
happens,
boston
&
maine
has
the
absolute
right
to
petition
for
inclusion
into
penn-central.
so
this
penn-central
was
quite
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
--
it's
the
double
provision
of
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
in
penn-central
plus
the
conditions
in
the
inclusion
order.
yes
sir,
it's
a
combined
effect
of
those
two
orders.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
the
d
&
h
turns
it
down,
they
do
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
petition.
however,
as
in
the
case
of
cnj,
a
mutual
petition
by
penn-central
and
by
the
d
&
h,
yes,
and
of
course
it
was
said
that
the
--
oh,
d
&
h
was
never
thinking
of
that.
the
affidavit
in
the
district
court
which
was
in
this
record,
indicated
that
mr.
silleck
said
that
mr.
dumaine
had
in
mind
a
new
england
system.
in
addition
to
his
idea
of
making
the
d
&
h
part
of
a
new
england
system,
he
said
there
are
other
plans
that
d
&
h
might
consider.
he
said
that
possibly
d
&
h
should
become
part
of
the
merged
penn-central.
so
there,
they
have
that
very
much
in
mind.
now
i
agree
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
sure,
he
does.
he
wants
to
--
he
wants
this
price
fixed
so
that
he
can
go
and
try
and
do
better,
that's
the
claim
on
it.
now,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
hold
up
value,
(inaudible)
the
playoff
value,
the
shopping
around
value
is
bad.
i
agree
that
the
portions
of
the
commission
order
that
let
them
go
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
for
four
years
in
the
shop
around,
that's
bad.
and
the
solicitor
general
says,
he
has
sympathy
for
this
problem.
well,
we
don't
want
sympathy.
we
want
appendix
g
declared
unlawful
for
letting
this
happen
in
contrary
to
the
mandate
of
the
court.
what
appendix
g
does
today
is
cater
solely
to
the
private
interest.
the
private
interest
of
the
stockholders
as
contrasted
with
running
this
railroad
because
the
more
traffic
that's
taken
away
by
penn-central,
the
more
the
stockholder
interest
is
protected
without
regard
to
whether
the
railroad
has
the
traffic
to
compete
with
penn-central
or
not.
it's
because
appendix
g
has
no
function
other
than
to
subsidize
the
shopping
spree
that
it
causes
this
problem.
that's
the
evil
of
the
penn-central
order
as
it's
now
set
up.
now
last
term,
the
solicitor
general
said
in
response
to
this
very
indemnity
pool
that's
set
up,
to
give
the
three
smaller
roads
a
permanent
stay
in
the
financial
success
of
penn-central
would
be
almost
like
decreeing
their
affiliation
with
the
penn-central
system
and
thereby
giving
that
system
a
virtual
monopoly
in
new
england
and
new
york.
this
is
what
appendix
g
does,
puts
them
together.
it
puts
the
stockholders
in
the
financial
pool
with
penn-central.
it
doesn't
do
much
for
keeping
the
traffic
on
the
railroad,
of
course
not.
but
it
isn't
--
it
serves
only
to
protect
these
private
interests.
now
the
question
here
is
why
didn't
the
commission
do
what
we
all
expected
they
do?
to
determine
the
ultimate
faith,
determine.
can
you
get
in
penn-central
or
can't
you?
not
leave
this
thing
to
negotiations
and
petitions
and
all.
i
want
this
court
to
know
that
since
we
were
here
last,
i
have
asked
in
both
proceedings
and
these
proceedings
went
separately
before
the
commission.
i
asked
them
in
the
inclusion
case,
decide
the
faith,
decide
the
--
to
foreclose
penn-central.
i
asked
in
the
penn-central
case,
decide
this.
in
the
penn
--
in
the
inclusion
case,
i
got
this
show,
i
said,
“oh
that's
not
an
issue
here.
we're
just
talking
about
n
&
w”.
in
the
penn-central
case,
i
got
silenced.
this
ship
just
passed
the
night.
this
wouldn't
decide
the
ultimate
faith
of
these
roads.
it's
not
enough
to
just
provide
an
opportunity.
come
on
in
on
these
terms
if
you'd
like
to
come.
they
should've
decided
the
faith
of
these
roads.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
how
do
they
do
that?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
decide
now
that
it's
going
to
be
--
well,
here
are
the
choices.
there
weren't
that
many
choices.
they
could
come
into
n
&
w.
either
n
&
w
or
n
&
w
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
decided
they
could
come
in.
they
decided
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
can
decide
that
you
--
that
penn-central
is
out
for
you
folks.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
had
done
that
plus
deciding
that
they
wouldn't
be
subsidized
to
the
injury
of
the
other
eastern
railroads
during
this
long
period.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
had
decided
that
penn-central
should
be
foreclosed
and
if
they
have
decided
the
form
in
which
the
n
&
w
ought
to
take
--
to
carry
these
roads
and
bear
in
mind
that
with
this
million
and
eight
of
operating
savings
which
is
peanuts
in
this
business,
there
are
great
opportunities
to
make
erie
a
viable
system
in
another
form
of
n
&
w.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we're
a
victim.
we're
not
a
party
to
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we're
a
victim.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
go
one
place
to
the
other
and
i
would
hope
they
would
go
to
a
deep
place,
the
ultimate
faith
that
this
court
expected
the
commission
would
decide
for
them
in
which
the
commission
keep
saying,
“well,
that's
something
we're
going
to
look
at
tomorrow
or
we're
going
to
see
some
more
petitions.
we
won't
get
to
the
ultimate
faith”.
on
closing,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
it's
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
administer
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
i
fairly
agree
with
that.
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
see
if
an
order
is
supported.
and
if
it's
found
that
the
order
is
not
supported
as
the
district
court
found
in
the
inclusion
case,
the
function
of
the
court
is
to
set
the
order
aside.
that's
--
it
was
the
district
court
that
failed
to
do
that
part
of
the
judicial
function.
it
looked
at
what
the
d
&
h
board
might
or
might
not
do
and
that's
one
of
the
basic
problems
we
have
here
today.
now
just
one
comment
on
the
boston
--
on
the
new
haven
situation,
these
losses,
i
think
one
footnote
should
be
added
to
the
practical
situation
on
the
new
haven.
it's
true
that
when
it's
included
in
the
penn-central
system,
it
maybe
as
that
segment
of
the
railroad
are
losing
proposition
still,
i
don't
know.
well,
i
do
know
that
erie-lackawanna
interchanges
a
100,000
cars
a
year
with
the
new
haven
right
across
the
hudson
river
and
the
penn-central
when
they
get
the
new
haven
will
have
the
opportunity
for
the
long
hall
to
chicago
or
wherever
its
going
of
those
--
any
part
of
that
100,000
cars
of
the
present
new
haven-erie
traffic.
that's
the
kind
of
practical
situation
where
new
haven
will
benefit
--
where
penn-central
benefit.
not
merely
by
getting
the
new
haven
as
a
separate
short
hall
operation
but
that's
the
kind
of
situation
where
the
penn-central
will
be
able
to
injure
and
then
as
the
commission
found
kill
the
erie.
that's
the
factual
situation
that
causes
that
and
that's
why
erie
can't
live
as
an
independent
railroad.
thank
you.
