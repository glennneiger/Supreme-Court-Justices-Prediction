mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
erie-lackawanna.
i'm
going
to
speak
about
the
inclusion
case
and
i'll
respond
directly
to
the
points
made
by
mr.
trienens
earlier
this
morning.
particularly,
the
method
that
the
commission
used
to
value
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
commission
in
the
court's
findings
that
erie-lackawanna
should
be
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
without
regard
to
whether
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
are
included.
i
have
furnished
the
court
with
a
map,
it's
on
a
little
brown
folder
and
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court
to
refer
to
that
matter.
prior
to
1964,
the
norfolk
&
western
was
a
little
railroad
that
ran
east
from
cincinnati
and
columbus,
ohio
through
west
virginia
down
to
the
port
of
norfolk.
it
had
annual
revenues
of
a
little
bit
more
than
$200
million,
was
25%
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
mr.
stuart
(inaudible)
is
now
the
president
of
pennsylvania
and
was
then
the
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western.
he
got
together
with
mr.
pevler,
now
the
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western
but
then
the
president
of
the
wabash
which
was
65%
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
they
got
together
with
the
nickel
plate
and
formed
a
new
system
which
the
commission
approved
in
1964.
that
system
is
the
map
i've
given
you
shows
runs
from
kansas
city
and
omaha
and
st.
louis
through
chicago
in
toledo,
in
detroit
into
buffalo.
the
revenue
of
that
new
system
is
about
triple
with
what
the
old
norfolk
&
western
was.
the
net
income
is
more
than
doubled.
approval
of
that
system
by
the
commission
gave
the
n
&
w
three
very
important
things.
one,
it
gave
them
$29
million
a
year
of
annual
operating
savings.
it
has
already
enabled
that
new
system
to
generate
an
additional
$50
million
of
revenue
over
and
above
what
the
system
was
in
1964.
and
of
course
it
gave
them
a
great
jump
on
the
rest
of
the
east,
the
penn-central
in
the
rest
of
us.the
price
of
that
consolidation
was
appendix
o
which
you
all
know
about.
erie-lackawanna
presently
has
about
$230
million
of
revenue
and
it
rus
from
chicago
east
through
buffalo,
new
york
on
a
line
which
is
generally
south
of
the
lines
of
the
old
nickel
plate
and
wabash
and
now
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
and
then
it
runs
through
buffalo
about
450
miles
further
east
into
the
port
of
new
york.
but
the
port
of
new
york
area
not
only
has
about
10%
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
but
it
also
does
about
10%
of
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
in
the
context
of
a
penn-central
merger,
erie-lackawanna
is
vital
from
competitive
point
of
view
to
the
norfolk
&
western.
erie-lackawanna
serves
113
points,
also
served
by
penn-central
but
not
served
by
the
norfolk
&
western.
and
those
points
include
new
york,
rochester,
syracuse,
scranton,
pennsylvania,
youngstown,
ohio.
the
commission
has
found
that
erie-lackawanna
stockholders
should
receive
about
$50
million
in
present
value
for
their
stock
from
the
norfolk
&
western.
i
want
to
explain
to
you
very
briefly
just
to
touch
on
the
basis
and
the
method
in
which
it
went
about
doing
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
let
me
explain
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
bondholders
mr.
justice
white.
before
we
filed
our
application,
before
we
filed
our
plan
with
the
commission,
we
went
to
our
bondholders.
we
told
them
that
in
the
judgment
of
(inaudible)
who
we'd
hired
as
financial
experts,
the
commission
would
not
authorize
a
full
merger
of
erie-lackawanna
into
n
&
w
unless
the
debt
holders
who
owned
$350
million
worth
of
face
amount
of
debt
would
agree
to
a
write
down
of
their
debt.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
those
are
all
of
the
debts
mr.
justice
white
all
of
the
debt
holders,
general
mortgage,
contingent
interest
bondholders,
every
kind
of
debt
that
we
have.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
perfectly
simple,
although
that
the
bondholders
were
--
had
a
face
amount
of
debt
of
$350
million,
the
market
value
of
that
debt
was
about
half
of
that.
and
if
we
require
norfolk
&
western
to
assume
that
debt,
it
would
become
the
value,
the
market
value
of
the
erie-lackawanna
bond
would
double
on
the
day
that
the
norfolk
&
western
assume
the
value.
so
we
said
to
the
bondholders,
if
you
want
a
full
merger
in
our
judgment,
you're
going
to
have
to
agree
to
write
your
debt
down.
you're
going
to
take
norfolk
&
western
securities
for
it.
its
worth
more
in
the
market
than
the
securities
you
now
have
and
you're
going
to
have
to
agree
to
reduction.
if
you
don't,
we
believe
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
will
authorize
is
a
control
relation,
stock
control.
now
the
creditors
sent
back
the
word
to
us
that
they
were
not
at
all
interested
and
this
includes
too
of
mr.
fooshee's
clients
and
this
was
before
the
hearings
ever
began
before
the
evidence
was
ever
submitted.
now
mr.
fooshee
and
his
clients
did
not
come
in
to
the
commission
and
submit
any
evidence
whatsoever.
they
did
not
suggest
to
the
commission
that
any
plan
other
than
the
plan
that
the
erie-lackawanna
proposed
should
be
undertaken
by
the
commission
until
after
all
the
evidence
was
in.
they
started
by
saying
they
wanted
a
merger
and
they
wanted
assumption
of
that
debt.
now
all
they
want
is
some
kind
of
a
reservation
jurisdiction
in
case
the
norfolk
&
western
at
some
future
time
does
something,
they
don't
know
what
that
might
in
some
way
injure
them.
they
don't
know
how.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
market
your
honor
but
it
is
because
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
certainly.
not
poor
chances
of
being
paid
but
the
fact
that
the
interest
hasn't
been
paid.
in
the
contingent
interest
bonds
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
particularly,
the
market
value
was
only
about
a
third.
interest
had
not
been
paid
on
those
contingent
interest
bonds
for
three
years
i
believe
at
the
time
or
perhaps
more
than
that
at
the
time
of
the
plan
but
the
market
had
valued
them
relative
to
the
norfolk
&
western
which
is
the
problem
much
lower
than
the
bond
of
the
norfolk
&
western.
the
bonds
also
were
old
bonds
and
the
interest
rate
was
relatively
low
and
i
suppose
a
financial
expert
would
give
you
a
number
of
other
reasons
as
well.
now,
the
first
thing
i
think
that
the
commission
looked
at
in
valuing
the
erie-lackawanna
was
the
turnaround
and
this
is
an
important
turnaround.
in
1961,
the
year
that
the
norfolk
&
western
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
erie-lackawanna
to
negotiate
forthwith
in
good
faith
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna-norfolk
&
western,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$26.5
million.
in
1963,
the
last
year
end
figures
available
to
the
norfolk
&
western
when
they
irrevocably
ascended
to
appendix
o,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$17.1
million.
in
1964,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$8.3
million
and
let
me
pause
in
point
to
the
significance
of
that
figure.
in
august
of
1965,
the
norfolk
&
western
announced
to
the
public
and
then
the
erie-lackawanna
that
it
was
entering
into
a
merger
with
the
agreement
with
the
c
&
o
and
that
as
a
side
proposal
to
that
merger,
it
would
enter
into
a
so-called
dereco
plan
to
take
in
five
small
carriers
including
the
erie-lackawanna.
under
that
plan,
norfolk
&
western
offered
erie-lackawanna's
shareholders
a
package
which
they
valued
at
$43
million.
now
they
arrived
at
that
$43
million
in
a
very
simple
way.
this
is
spelled
out
in
our
brief
below
at
page
12.
they
took
1964
earnings,
a
loss
of
$8.3
million
and
adjusted
it
for
two
things,
first,
for
an
assumed
elimination
of
75%
of
the
commuter
deficit.
and
second,
for
the
assumed
consolidation
savings
that
would
result
from
theinclusion
of
erie-lackawanna
and
norfolk
&
western.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not
by
merger.
in
the
same
way
it
is
being
included
now.
now,
my
point
is
not
that
the
dereco
offer
was
worth
that
because
we
thought
it
was
not.
it
was
not
then
and
we
think
it
is
not
now.
but
the
point
is
that
norfolk
&
western
concluded
that
it
was
worth
$43
million
and
it
did
it
primarily
on
the
basis
of
a
loss
of
$8.3
million.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that's
not
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
in
due
course.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
exactly
the
claim
they
now
have.
exactly
what
their
indenture
gives
them,
no
more
and
no
less.
and
they
asked
the
approval
of
the
commission
that
they
were
entitled
in
no
less.
and
that's
what
judge
friendly
said,
they've
got
a
contract.
they
don't
claim
the
contract
has
been
violated
and
we
don't
see
any
point
in
considering
giving
them
any
relief.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
same
difference,
yes
sir.
now,
you
maybe
told
that
the
norfolk
&
western
and
c
&
o
concluded
that
they
could
make
this
magnificent
offer
of
$43
million
to
the
erie-lackawanna
because
of
the
strength
of
the
new
n
&
w-c
&
o
system.
that
is
not
so
and
we've
attached
to
the
motion
to
affirm
in
the
inclusion
case,
a
memorandum
which
mr.
fishwick,
the
senior
vice
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western
prepared
and
mr.
pevler
read
to
the
norfolk
&
western
board
of
directors
as
the
sole
basis,
the
sole
basis
for
the
norfolk
&
western
board's
approval
of
the
c
&
o
merger
and
approval
of
the
dereco
plan.
we've
got
that
memorandum
out
of
an
unrelated
court
proceeding
and
we
introduced
it
into
evidence
before
the
commission
and
i
called
it
particularly
to
their
attention
as
i
now
call
it
to
yours.
on
page
8
a
of
our
appendix,
mr.
pevler
tells
the
norfolk
&
western
board,
“the
inclusion
of
the
other
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna
and
these
other
four,
through
subsidiaries
makes
the
deal
even
more
attractive”.
he
then
talks
about
the
tax
savings
which
i
will
talk
about
in
a
minute
and
points
out
that
this
would
lead
to
savings
to
norfolk
&
western
a
net
income
of
$75
to
$100
million.
he
talks
about
the
operating
savings
in
the
increased
business
generated
and
he
points
out
that
erie-lack
--
that
norfolk
&
western's
net
income
per
share
of
stock
would
rise
from
$11.82
a
share
to
$18
a
share.
norfolk
&
western
and
c
&
o
have
always
cast
this
dereco
plan
as
a
sort
of
poverty
program
designed
for
the
welfare
of
these
five
railroads.
it
just
isn't
that.
it
is
a
bonanza
for
the
norfolk
&
western.
now
going
back
to
what
the
commission
did
and
this
was
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
one
of
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
your
honor,
that
is
truly
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that
is
true,
your
honor
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
as
my
second
point
and
i'll
deal
with
that
at
some
length.
the
commission
used
the
years
of
1965
and
1966
as
the
base
period
for
considering
erie-lackawanna
earnings.
and
in
those
years,
the
new
management
which
erie-lackawanna
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
attain
--
obtain
in
1963,
the
results
of
that
management
begin
to
show
a
revenue
in
9
--
in
the
base
period,
that
two-year
period,
was
up
$23
million
as
against
1961.
but
this
is
important
too,
the
expenses
were
down
$7
million.
we
detail
at
great
length
how
the
new
management
had
turned
it
around,
the
commission
accepted
and
approved
that
evidence.
taking
the
base
period,
the
commission
then
made
adjustments
to
the
net
income
for
those
two
years,
both
up
and
down,
and
concluded
the
future
average
annual
earnings
would
be
normally
about
$9.6
million.
that
is
net
after
all
charges.
mr.
trienens
read
to
you
this
morning
the
commission's
finding
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
here
only
if
erie-lackawanna
were
able
to
cover
its
fixed
charges.
that
doesn't
mean
that
erie-lackawanna
should
earn
$9.6
million.
it
means
that
erie-lackawanna
should
earn
nothing
at
all.
that
will
cover
fixed
charges.
now
let
me
take
this
$9.6
million.
the
commission
compared
that
figure
to
norfolk
&
western's
earnings
and
worked
out
a
mathematical
exchange
ratio,
the
ratio
was
.172
shares
of
norfolk
&
western
stock
for
each
share
of
erie-lackawanna
stock.
but
they
didn't
give
us
.172
to
one
or
anything
like
it.
they
discounted
it
twice.
first,
they
discounted
it
about
25%
to
.128
to
one.
then
they
discounted
to
the
second
time
because
they
didn't
give
us
norfolk
&
western
stock,
they
gave
us
stock
in
a
new
corporation,
nc
stock
which
will
not
pay
dividends
for
five
years
and
which
is
convertible
into
norfolk
&
western
stock
only
at
the
end
of
those
five
years.
norfolk
&
western's
financial
expert
testified
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
stock
of
the
new
corporation
would
sell
for
15%
to
20%
below
n
&
w's
stock
into
which
it
is
convertible
five
years
hence.
so
that
means
that
the
commission
took
this
$9.6
million
and
discounted
it
about
40%.
the
reason
why
it
did
that
is
perfectly
clear
and
said
so,
because
the
quality
of
the
earnings
are
different
and
by
that
they
meant
the
leverage
factor.
erie-lackawanna
has
relatively
high
fixed
charges
and
because
of
its
past
losses
does
not
pay
income
taxes.
norfolk
&
western
has
relatively
low
fixed
charges
and
does
pay
income
taxes.
that's
when
you're
comparing
the
net,
the
fluctuation
in
erie-lackawanna's
will
be
much
more
extreme
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
in
bad
times
of
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir,
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
the
earnings
as
a
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
system
because
this
$9.6
million
includes
million
eight
of
operating
savings
and
it
also
includes
a
million
six
of
traffic
gains.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
quite
farfetched
is
exactly
the
way
i
would
describe
it,
your
honor.
i
would
not
have
--
even
spend
anytime
with
it.
i
think
judge
friendly
deals
with
it
quite
adequately
and
i
would
leave
it
to
that.
in
addition
to
these
earnings
said
the
commission,
even
if
the
earnings
are
not
sufficient
to
support
the
exchange
ratio,
norfolk
&
western's
investment
will
be
well
protected
by
the
tax
benefits.
these
are
the
benefits
that
mr.
fishwick
and
mr.
pevler
told
the
n
&
w
board
about.
we've
quantified
those
benefits.
commissioner
webb,
the
hearing
officer
adopted
our
testimony,
n
&
w
did
not
accept
to
his
findings
the
commission
adopted.
they
are
absolutely
undisputed
and
they
are
very
large
--
i'll
mention
just
two
of
it.
first,
each
and
every
year,
erie-lackawanna
will
give
to
norfolk
&
western
a
million
dollars
in
investment
credit,
not
a
tax
deduction
but
an
investment
credit.
in
addition
to
that
$1
million
in
the
commission's
language,
and
i
quote,
“for
every
dollar
by
which
e-l
earnings
fall
below
$10.2
million,
n
&
w
would
obtain
a
tax
benefit
of
48
cents
which
would
directly
produce
earnings
for
norfolk
&
western
stockholders”.
as
we
show
in
our
brief
if
we
have
zero
earnings,
there
would
still
be
a
contribution
to
norfolk
&
western
of
six
million
dollars
in
net
income
through
the
tax
deduction
by
filing
a
consolidated
return.
that's
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
there
is
not.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
are
some
conditions,
but
they're
minor
and
they
relate
to
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
judge
friendly
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
theoretically,
that
is
a
possibility
your
honor,
and
if
the
norfolk
&
western
violates
the
contracts
that
these
bondholders
have
or
if
they
deal
with
them
in
a
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
oh,
i
suggest
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
they
would
your
honor
if
they
do
what
you
suggest
because
they
would
--
the
only
way
they
can
do
that
is
by
diverting
traffic
improperly
away
from
the
norfolk
&
western.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
judge
friendly
said
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
they
have
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
and
i
agree
with
him.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i'm
sure
they
will
tell
you
that
they
do
not.
now,
i
mentioned
1967
earnings
only
in
passing.
the
commission
had
before
every
conceivable
kind
of
financial
information
from
the
beginning
of
1956
through
the
first
quarter
of
1967.
every
railroad
in
the
united
states
has
lost
revenue
this
year.
every
railroads
earnings
are
down.
our
first
six
months
showed
a
loss
of
$7.7
million.
for
the
new
york
central,
the
first
six
months
of
1966,
they
made
$36.6
million
and
in
the
first
six
months
of
1967,
they
lost
$2.6
million.
but
pennsylvania
was
down
from
$33
million
to
$7
million.
even
the
norfolk
&
western
which
is
building
in
this
$29
million
of
annual
operating
savings
went
down
from
$71
million
to
$54
million.
the
process
of
judicial
review
just
can't
work
if
on
six
months
more
of
earnings,
this
court
will
send
it
back
to
the
commission
for
a
new
consideration
because
we'll
just
go
on
doing
that
forever.
it
will
always
change.
now
i
want
to
turn
to
the
findings
that
both
the
district
court
made
and
the
commission
made
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
and
b
&
m.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
this
respect
the
map
i
think
maybe
particularly
helpful,
but
i
first
call
to
the
court's
attention
judge
friendly's
finding
on
page
57
of
the
opinion
in
which
he
states,
“the
record
which
contain
not
only
a
study
of
the
gains
from
inclusion
of
all
three
roads,
the
four-way
study,
but
studies
of
the
gains
from
the
inclusion
of
each
supports
the
earnings
ratio
established
for
e-l
even
on
the
assumption
that
neither
d
&
h
nor
b
&
m
is
included”.
the
commission
expressly
found
and
ordered
erie-lack
--
the
norfolk
&
western
to
include
erie-lackawanna
even
if
neither
b
&
a
--
b
&
m
nor
d
&
h
were
included.
in
the
reply
of
n
&
w
to
the
petitions
of
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
for
reconsideration,
n
&
w
did
not
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration
but
in
their
reply,
they
said
in
passing,
“the
commission's
findings
are
based
upon
the
explicit
premise
that
all
three
of
the
petitioners
will
be
included.”
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
expressly
said
that
norfolk
&
western
was
wrong
and
repeated
the
order
and
the
finding
directing
norfolk
&
western
to
include
erie-lackawanna
in
norfolk
&
western
even
if
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
not
included.
now
n
&
w
says
those
findings
are
inadequate
because
they
say,
this
court
must
assume
that
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
stockholders
were
both
to
reject
these
terms
and
because
the
court
must
further
assume
that
if
they
do,
d
&
h
and
erie-lackawanna's
value
relative
to
the
norfolk
&
western
will
be
substantially
reduced.
now
if
the
stockholders
both
know
there
are
four
possibilities
that
the
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
stockholders
both
know,
first,
they
will
stay
independent.
second,
they
will
be
included
in
penn-central.
third,
they
will
become
involved
in
a
new
england
system
which
is
what
mr.
dumaine
of
the
norfolk
--
of
the
delaware
&
hudson
has
in
mind
and
that's
what
this
letter
relates
to.
and
third,
they
will
be
included
forth
--
they
will
be
included
in
an
n
&
w-c
&
o
system.
i
say,
the
only
alternative
that
the
commission
have
to
concern
itself
with,
the
only
possible
alternative
it
could
have
considered
is
that
the
two
railroad
would
remain
independent
because
any
future
consolidation
involving
penn-central
or
new
england
system
or
anything
you
want,
any
future
consisting
--
system
--
consolidation
requires
commission
approval
under
section
5.
i
cannot
imagine
the
interstate
commerce
commission
creating
a
monopoly
in
all
of
new
england,
northern
new
york,
the
rail
service
simply
because
that
the
stockholders
of
the
d
&
h
and
the
b
&
m
will
have
it
no
other
way.
but
let
us
assume
that
they
did
make
such
a
finding.
the
commission
would
still
have
the
power
and
be
required
to
condition
that
finding
upon
terms
and
conditions
which
would
at
least
attempt
to
continue
to
promote
competition
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
through
the
erie-lackawanna's
connection
with
the
d
&
h
(inaudible).
that
is
the
time
to
consider
what
the
problem
is,
to
measure
what
the
problem
is,
the
commission
has
shown
through
appendix
g
of
the
penn-central
case
that
it
is
capable
of
doing
that
and
that
is
the
time
to
let
them
do
it.
but
let
me
just
refer
to
this
map
and
show
you
what
the
facts
--
the
basic
simple
facts
in
light
of
this.
erie-lackawanna
and
norfolk
&
western
will
have
revenues
of
$850
million
and
freight
revenues
of
about
$815
million.
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
will
have
revenues
of
about
$100
million
and
freight
revenues
of
about
$90
million.
the
only
thing
we're
concerned
with
is
east-west
traffic.
this
--
the
east-west
traffic
presently
moves
from
the
erie-lackawanna
to
the
delaware
&
hudson
at
binghamton,
new
york
and
delaware
&
hudson
then
carries
it
150
miles
to
the
b
&
m
and
gives
it
to
the
b
&
m
a
mechanic
bill.
the
bulk
of
all
east
bound
and
west
bound
traffic
on
those
railroads
now
moves
that
way.
there
are
only
two
present,
possible,
physical
alternatives.
first,
the
b
&
m
on
east
--
on
west
bound
traffic
that
give
it
to
the
new
york
central
at
mechanic
bill,
rotterdam
junction.
that
would
cut
the
d
&
h
out
of
the
movement
entirely,
but
the
boston
&
maine
doesn't
do
that
today.
the
reason
they
--
today,
deliver
it
three
times
as
much
the
d
&
h
as
they
do
to
the
b
&
m
at
the
same
place
--
i'm
sorry.
they
deliver
three
times
as
much
to
the
d
&
h
as
they
do
to
the
central
at
the
same
place.
they
deliver
it
to
the
new
york
central
only
that
traffic
which
new
york
central
has
to
terminate.
the
reason
is
perfectly
simple.
on
this
map,
we
don't
have
the
new
york
central
but
the
new
york
central
has
a
line
that
runs
from
albany
to
boston
through
springfield
and
worcester
that
the
b
&
m
starts
giving
away
his
traffic
to
the
new
york
central,
it
only
a
matter
of
days
until
the
new
york
central
reaches
back
in
to
the
same
origin,
and
picks
the
traffic
up
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
the
reason
why
b
&
m
doesn't
give
it
today.
the
d
&
h
could
carry
the
traffic
given
to
it
by
the
b
&
m
down
to
the
pennsylvania
at
wilkes-barre.
it
doesn't
do
that
today
for
two
perfectly
good
reasons.
one
is
because
the
route
is
circuitous.
the
pennsylvania
has
to
carry
it
south
to
harrisburg
to
put
it
on
the
main
line
of
the
pennsylvania.
the
other
reason
is
because
it's
not
economic.
the
d
&
h
does
not
receive
enough
money
for
carrying
out
the
additional
distance
beyond
bringing
it
up
until
wilkes-barre
so
it
doesn't
do
it.
and
let's
assume
a
penn-central
system
and
assume
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
remained
independent
or
that
mr.
dumaine's
idea,
dream
of
a
new
england
system
becomes
a
reality,
what
happens
to
the
traffic?
first,
you
have
to
understand
that
under
the
penn-central
plan
of
operation,
all
traffic
originating
or
terminating
west
of
youngstown,
ohio
and
destined
to
or
from
new
england
or
the
state
of
new
york
will
move
on
the
new
york
central
main
line.
but
the
main
line
of
the
new
york
central
runs
north
from
new
york
city
through
albany
where
it
gears
directly
west
and
runs
along
the
southern
border
of
the
great
lakes,
the
so-called
new
york
central
water
level
route.
new
york
central
is
building
a
big
yard
at
albany,
the
selkirk
yard
and
all
traffic
will
move
through
that
yard.
alright,
what
happens?
this
is
the
problem
that
mr.
shapp
and
scranton
have.
they
--
downgrading
of
the
pennsylvania
main
line
through
pennsylvania
and
moving
all
the
traffic
up
to
the
new
york
central.
what
happens
to
d
&
h
and
b
&
m?
it's
conceivable
that
the
d
&
h
will
give
west
bound
traffic
to
the
new
york
central
at
albany
and
cut
itself
out
of
the
hall
entirely,
its
150
miles
from
albany
to
binghamton.
the
d
&
h
might
as
well
go
out
of
business
as
gives
its
traffic
to
the
new
york
central.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
no
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
possible
way
that
the
traffic
can
move
except
over
the
erie-lackawanna,
no
possible
way.
the
traffic
--
the
commission
said
that
the
railroads
are
interdependent.
they
are
but
the
d
&
h
and
the
b
&
m
are
dependent
upon
the
erie-lackawanna.
it's
not
the
other
way
around.
the
d
&
h
is
not
going
to
solicit
traffic
east
bound
for
the
new
york
central
because
that
just
eliminates
the
d
&
h
from
any
movement.
that's
preposterous.
same
thing
is
true
about
the
b
&
m.
in
addition
to
the
new
york
central
which
they
presently
have
this
competition
in
new
england,
they're
going
to
have
the
new
haven.
they're
not
going
to
give
their
traffic
away
to
the
new
york
central
system
or
the
penn-central
system
anymore
than
they
presently
give
it
away
in
new
york
central.
there
aren't
any
other
alternatives.
well,
there
is
a
possibility
you
might
--
theoretically,
you
might
take
it
up
to
canada
and
move
it
above
the
great
lakes,
that's
the
other
physical
possibility
but
that
is
not
a
realistic
one.
now
the
traffic
studies
which
i
will
not
try
to
describe
except
to
say
this
about
the
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
we
made
five
traffic
studies.
we
studied
our
own
traffic.
we
studied
two-way
merger,
two-way
control,
four-way
merger,
four-way
control
and
we
studied
the
impact
of
penn-central
on
a
merged
norfolk
&
western-erie-lackawanna
system.
the
reason
we
studied
it
on
a
merged
system
is
because
what
we
have
proposed
was
a
two-step
merger.
the
first
step
was
control,
the
second
step
with
merger
and
we
suggested
a
number
of
ways
by
which
the
norfolk
&
western
could
take
care
of
the
debt
problem
when
we
pointed
out
that
there
at
least
$15
million
of
additional
operating
savings
through
merger
and
we
think
the
norfolk
&
western
will
merge
with
erie-lackawanna
in
due
course.
but
the
commission
concluded
there
should
not
be
a
merger.
the
norfolk
&
western
did
not
make
any
studies
at
all
of
its
own
traffic.
they
simply
presented
critiques
of
our
traffic.
all
of
their
critiques
of
all
of
our
traffic
studies
were
rejected
by
the
commission.
n
&
w
made
one
more
traffic
study
and
that
was
a
four-way
control
study
of
the
impact
of
penn-central
on
the
package
that
mr.
trienens
said
this
morning.
they
did
not
make
or
try
to
make
or
suggested
the
commission
that
there
ought
to
be
made
a
study
which
would
give
the
evidence
which
n
&
w
now
says
the
commission
should
have
had
with
respect
of
breaking
these
down
in
two-way
control.
now,
the
--
our
brief
makes
clear
how
the
studies
that
are
in
the
record
bear
out
with
the
physical
facts
that
i've
tried
to
show
to
you
by
the
map
suggests.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
this
is
why
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
am
arguing
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i'm
arguing
that
the
problem
is
so
small
and
so
insignificant
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
that
it
is
not
and
that
the
findings
that
were
made
by
the
commission
are
perfectly
adequate
to
deal
with
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
this
is
a
tempest
in
the
teapot,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
i
don't
think
you
do
your
honor.
i
think
you
should
--
because
i
think
i
indicated
in
the
beginning,
assume
that
the
commission's
order
will
be
carried
out.
i
don't
think
that
any
other
proper
or
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
if
any
other
assumption
is
proper.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
justice
fortas
that
is
all
the
commission
can
do.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir,
you
do
not.
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
seems
to
me
it
ends
the
judicial
job,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
--
if
you
get
any
deeper
than
that,
i
don't
know
where
you're
in.
you
just
keep
going
back
and
forth.
let
me
end
by
saying
simply
this
that
unlike
many
of
the
records
that
have
been
before
this
court
in
some
of
these
merger
proceedings
where
the
applicants
only
presented
evidence
where
the
evidence
was
not
cross-examined,
where
the
parties
did
not
present
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
every
single
bit
of
evidence
in
this
case
was
vigorously
brought
over
by
all
of
the
parties.
this
record
is
thorough,
it's
extensive
that
it
contains
nothing
but
hard
realistic
facts
that
all
counsel
have
had
more
than
their
day
in
court
to
challenge.
it
may
not
be
a
perfect
order.
there
may
be
no
perfect
resolution
to
this
problem
in
the
east
but
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
commission's
order
is
the
best
that
anyone
could
reasonably
expect
and
it
ought
to
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
erie-lackawanna.
i'm
going
to
speak
about
the
inclusion
case
and
i'll
respond
directly
to
the
points
made
by
mr.
trienens
earlier
this
morning.
particularly,
the
method
that
the
commission
used
to
value
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
commission
in
the
court's
findings
that
erie-lackawanna
should
be
included
in
the
norfolk
&
western
without
regard
to
whether
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
are
included.
i
have
furnished
the
court
with
a
map,
it's
on
a
little
brown
folder
and
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court
to
refer
to
that
matter.
prior
to
1964,
the
norfolk
&
western
was
a
little
railroad
that
ran
east
from
cincinnati
and
columbus,
ohio
through
west
virginia
down
to
the
port
of
norfolk.
it
had
annual
revenues
of
a
little
bit
more
than
$200
million,
was
25%
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
mr.
stuart
(inaudible)
is
now
the
president
of
pennsylvania
and
was
then
the
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western.
he
got
together
with
mr.
pevler,
now
the
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western
but
then
the
president
of
the
wabash
which
was
65%
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
they
got
together
with
the
nickel
plate
and
formed
a
new
system
which
the
commission
approved
in
1964.
that
system
is
the
map
i've
given
you
shows
runs
from
kansas
city
and
omaha
and
st.
louis
through
chicago
in
toledo,
in
detroit
into
buffalo.
the
revenue
of
that
new
system
is
about
triple
with
what
the
old
norfolk
&
western
was.
the
net
income
is
more
than
doubled.
approval
of
that
system
by
the
commission
gave
the
n
&
w
three
very
important
things.
one,
it
gave
them
$29
million
a
year
of
annual
operating
savings.
it
has
already
enabled
that
new
system
to
generate
an
additional
$50
million
of
revenue
over
and
above
what
the
system
was
in
1964.
and
of
course
it
gave
them
a
great
jump
on
the
rest
of
the
east,
the
penn-central
in
the
rest
of
us.the
price
of
that
consolidation
was
appendix
o
which
you
all
know
about.
erie-lackawanna
presently
has
about
$230
million
of
revenue
and
it
rus
from
chicago
east
through
buffalo,
new
york
on
a
line
which
is
generally
south
of
the
lines
of
the
old
nickel
plate
and
wabash
and
now
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
and
then
it
runs
through
buffalo
about
450
miles
further
east
into
the
port
of
new
york.
but
the
port
of
new
york
area
not
only
has
about
10%
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
but
it
also
does
about
10%
of
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
in
the
context
of
a
penn-central
merger,
erie-lackawanna
is
vital
from
competitive
point
of
view
to
the
norfolk
&
western.
erie-lackawanna
serves
113
points,
also
served
by
penn-central
but
not
served
by
the
norfolk
&
western.
and
those
points
include
new
york,
rochester,
syracuse,
scranton,
pennsylvania,
youngstown,
ohio.
the
commission
has
found
that
erie-lackawanna
stockholders
should
receive
about
$50
million
in
present
value
for
their
stock
from
the
norfolk
&
western.
i
want
to
explain
to
you
very
briefly
just
to
touch
on
the
basis
and
the
method
in
which
it
went
about
doing
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
let
me
explain
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
bondholders
mr.
justice
white.
before
we
filed
our
application,
before
we
filed
our
plan
with
the
commission,
we
went
to
our
bondholders.
we
told
them
that
in
the
judgment
of
(inaudible)
who
we'd
hired
as
financial
experts,
the
commission
would
not
authorize
a
full
merger
of
erie-lackawanna
into
n
&
w
unless
the
debt
holders
who
owned
$350
million
worth
of
face
amount
of
debt
would
agree
to
a
write
down
of
their
debt.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
those
are
all
of
the
debts
mr.
justice
white
all
of
the
debt
holders,
general
mortgage,
contingent
interest
bondholders,
every
kind
of
debt
that
we
have.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
perfectly
simple,
although
that
the
bondholders
were
--
had
a
face
amount
of
debt
of
$350
million,
the
market
value
of
that
debt
was
about
half
of
that.
and
if
we
require
norfolk
&
western
to
assume
that
debt,
it
would
become
the
value,
the
market
value
of
the
erie-lackawanna
bond
would
double
on
the
day
that
the
norfolk
&
western
assume
the
value.
so
we
said
to
the
bondholders,
if
you
want
a
full
merger
in
our
judgment,
you're
going
to
have
to
agree
to
write
your
debt
down.
you're
going
to
take
norfolk
&
western
securities
for
it.
its
worth
more
in
the
market
than
the
securities
you
now
have
and
you're
going
to
have
to
agree
to
reduction.
if
you
don't,
we
believe
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
will
authorize
is
a
control
relation,
stock
control.
now
the
creditors
sent
back
the
word
to
us
that
they
were
not
at
all
interested
and
this
includes
too
of
mr.
fooshee's
clients
and
this
was
before
the
hearings
ever
began
before
the
evidence
was
ever
submitted.
now
mr.
fooshee
and
his
clients
did
not
come
in
to
the
commission
and
submit
any
evidence
whatsoever.
they
did
not
suggest
to
the
commission
that
any
plan
other
than
the
plan
that
the
erie-lackawanna
proposed
should
be
undertaken
by
the
commission
until
after
all
the
evidence
was
in.
they
started
by
saying
they
wanted
a
merger
and
they
wanted
assumption
of
that
debt.
now
all
they
want
is
some
kind
of
a
reservation
jurisdiction
in
case
the
norfolk
&
western
at
some
future
time
does
something,
they
don't
know
what
that
might
in
some
way
injure
them.
they
don't
know
how.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
market
your
honor
but
it
is
because
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
certainly.
not
poor
chances
of
being
paid
but
the
fact
that
the
interest
hasn't
been
paid.
in
the
contingent
interest
bonds
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
particularly,
the
market
value
was
only
about
a
third.
interest
had
not
been
paid
on
those
contingent
interest
bonds
for
three
years
i
believe
at
the
time
or
perhaps
more
than
that
at
the
time
of
the
plan
but
the
market
had
valued
them
relative
to
the
norfolk
&
western
which
is
the
problem
much
lower
than
the
bond
of
the
norfolk
&
western.
the
bonds
also
were
old
bonds
and
the
interest
rate
was
relatively
low
and
i
suppose
a
financial
expert
would
give
you
a
number
of
other
reasons
as
well.
now,
the
first
thing
i
think
that
the
commission
looked
at
in
valuing
the
erie-lackawanna
was
the
turnaround
and
this
is
an
important
turnaround.
in
1961,
the
year
that
the
norfolk
&
western
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
erie-lackawanna
to
negotiate
forthwith
in
good
faith
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna-norfolk
&
western,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$26.5
million.
in
1963,
the
last
year
end
figures
available
to
the
norfolk
&
western
when
they
irrevocably
ascended
to
appendix
o,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$17.1
million.
in
1964,
erie-lackawanna
lost
$8.3
million
and
let
me
pause
in
point
to
the
significance
of
that
figure.
in
august
of
1965,
the
norfolk
&
western
announced
to
the
public
and
then
the
erie-lackawanna
that
it
was
entering
into
a
merger
with
the
agreement
with
the
c
&
o
and
that
as
a
side
proposal
to
that
merger,
it
would
enter
into
a
so-called
dereco
plan
to
take
in
five
small
carriers
including
the
erie-lackawanna.
under
that
plan,
norfolk
&
western
offered
erie-lackawanna's
shareholders
a
package
which
they
valued
at
$43
million.
now
they
arrived
at
that
$43
million
in
a
very
simple
way.
this
is
spelled
out
in
our
brief
below
at
page
12.
they
took
1964
earnings,
a
loss
of
$8.3
million
and
adjusted
it
for
two
things,
first,
for
an
assumed
elimination
of
75%
of
the
commuter
deficit.
and
second,
for
the
assumed
consolidation
savings
that
would
result
from
theinclusion
of
erie-lackawanna
and
norfolk
&
western.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not
by
merger.
in
the
same
way
it
is
being
included
now.
now,
my
point
is
not
that
the
dereco
offer
was
worth
that
because
we
thought
it
was
not.
it
was
not
then
and
we
think
it
is
not
now.
but
the
point
is
that
norfolk
&
western
concluded
that
it
was
worth
$43
million
and
it
did
it
primarily
on
the
basis
of
a
loss
of
$8.3
million.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that's
not
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
in
due
course.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
exactly
the
claim
they
now
have.
exactly
what
their
indenture
gives
them,
no
more
and
no
less.
and
they
asked
the
approval
of
the
commission
that
they
were
entitled
in
no
less.
and
that's
what
judge
friendly
said,
they've
got
a
contract.
they
don't
claim
the
contract
has
been
violated
and
we
don't
see
any
point
in
considering
giving
them
any
relief.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
same
difference,
yes
sir.
now,
you
maybe
told
that
the
norfolk
&
western
and
c
&
o
concluded
that
they
could
make
this
magnificent
offer
of
$43
million
to
the
erie-lackawanna
because
of
the
strength
of
the
new
n
&
w-c
&
o
system.
that
is
not
so
and
we've
attached
to
the
motion
to
affirm
in
the
inclusion
case,
a
memorandum
which
mr.
fishwick,
the
senior
vice
president
of
the
norfolk
&
western
prepared
and
mr.
pevler
read
to
the
norfolk
&
western
board
of
directors
as
the
sole
basis,
the
sole
basis
for
the
norfolk
&
western
board's
approval
of
the
c
&
o
merger
and
approval
of
the
dereco
plan.
we've
got
that
memorandum
out
of
an
unrelated
court
proceeding
and
we
introduced
it
into
evidence
before
the
commission
and
i
called
it
particularly
to
their
attention
as
i
now
call
it
to
yours.
on
page
8
a
of
our
appendix,
mr.
pevler
tells
the
norfolk
&
western
board,
“the
inclusion
of
the
other
railroads,
the
erie-lackawanna
and
these
other
four,
through
subsidiaries
makes
the
deal
even
more
attractive”.
he
then
talks
about
the
tax
savings
which
i
will
talk
about
in
a
minute
and
points
out
that
this
would
lead
to
savings
to
norfolk
&
western
a
net
income
of
$75
to
$100
million.
he
talks
about
the
operating
savings
in
the
increased
business
generated
and
he
points
out
that
erie-lack
--
that
norfolk
&
western's
net
income
per
share
of
stock
would
rise
from
$11.82
a
share
to
$18
a
share.
norfolk
&
western
and
c
&
o
have
always
cast
this
dereco
plan
as
a
sort
of
poverty
program
designed
for
the
welfare
of
these
five
railroads.
it
just
isn't
that.
it
is
a
bonanza
for
the
norfolk
&
western.
now
going
back
to
what
the
commission
did
and
this
was
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
one
of
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
your
honor,
that
is
truly
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that
is
true,
your
honor
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
as
my
second
point
and
i'll
deal
with
that
at
some
length.
the
commission
used
the
years
of
1965
and
1966
as
the
base
period
for
considering
erie-lackawanna
earnings.
and
in
those
years,
the
new
management
which
erie-lackawanna
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
attain
--
obtain
in
1963,
the
results
of
that
management
begin
to
show
a
revenue
in
9
--
in
the
base
period,
that
two-year
period,
was
up
$23
million
as
against
1961.
but
this
is
important
too,
the
expenses
were
down
$7
million.
we
detail
at
great
length
how
the
new
management
had
turned
it
around,
the
commission
accepted
and
approved
that
evidence.
taking
the
base
period,
the
commission
then
made
adjustments
to
the
net
income
for
those
two
years,
both
up
and
down,
and
concluded
the
future
average
annual
earnings
would
be
normally
about
$9.6
million.
that
is
net
after
all
charges.
mr.
trienens
read
to
you
this
morning
the
commission's
finding
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
here
only
if
erie-lackawanna
were
able
to
cover
its
fixed
charges.
that
doesn't
mean
that
erie-lackawanna
should
earn
$9.6
million.
it
means
that
erie-lackawanna
should
earn
nothing
at
all.
that
will
cover
fixed
charges.
now
let
me
take
this
$9.6
million.
the
commission
compared
that
figure
to
norfolk
&
western's
earnings
and
worked
out
a
mathematical
exchange
ratio,
the
ratio
was
.172
shares
of
norfolk
&
western
stock
for
each
share
of
erie-lackawanna
stock.
but
they
didn't
give
us
.172
to
one
or
anything
like
it.
they
discounted
it
twice.
first,
they
discounted
it
about
25%
to
.128
to
one.
then
they
discounted
to
the
second
time
because
they
didn't
give
us
norfolk
&
western
stock,
they
gave
us
stock
in
a
new
corporation,
nc
stock
which
will
not
pay
dividends
for
five
years
and
which
is
convertible
into
norfolk
&
western
stock
only
at
the
end
of
those
five
years.
norfolk
&
western's
financial
expert
testified
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
stock
of
the
new
corporation
would
sell
for
15%
to
20%
below
n
&
w's
stock
into
which
it
is
convertible
five
years
hence.
so
that
means
that
the
commission
took
this
$9.6
million
and
discounted
it
about
40%.
the
reason
why
it
did
that
is
perfectly
clear
and
said
so,
because
the
quality
of
the
earnings
are
different
and
by
that
they
meant
the
leverage
factor.
erie-lackawanna
has
relatively
high
fixed
charges
and
because
of
its
past
losses
does
not
pay
income
taxes.
norfolk
&
western
has
relatively
low
fixed
charges
and
does
pay
income
taxes.
that's
when
you're
comparing
the
net,
the
fluctuation
in
erie-lackawanna's
will
be
much
more
extreme
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
in
bad
times
of
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir,
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
the
earnings
as
a
part
of
the
norfolk
&
western
system
because
this
$9.6
million
includes
million
eight
of
operating
savings
and
it
also
includes
a
million
six
of
traffic
gains.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
quite
farfetched
is
exactly
the
way
i
would
describe
it,
your
honor.
i
would
not
have
--
even
spend
anytime
with
it.
i
think
judge
friendly
deals
with
it
quite
adequately
and
i
would
leave
it
to
that.
in
addition
to
these
earnings
said
the
commission,
even
if
the
earnings
are
not
sufficient
to
support
the
exchange
ratio,
norfolk
&
western's
investment
will
be
well
protected
by
the
tax
benefits.
these
are
the
benefits
that
mr.
fishwick
and
mr.
pevler
told
the
n
&
w
board
about.
we've
quantified
those
benefits.
commissioner
webb,
the
hearing
officer
adopted
our
testimony,
n
&
w
did
not
accept
to
his
findings
the
commission
adopted.
they
are
absolutely
undisputed
and
they
are
very
large
--
i'll
mention
just
two
of
it.
first,
each
and
every
year,
erie-lackawanna
will
give
to
norfolk
&
western
a
million
dollars
in
investment
credit,
not
a
tax
deduction
but
an
investment
credit.
in
addition
to
that
$1
million
in
the
commission's
language,
and
i
quote,
“for
every
dollar
by
which
e-l
earnings
fall
below
$10.2
million,
n
&
w
would
obtain
a
tax
benefit
of
48
cents
which
would
directly
produce
earnings
for
norfolk
&
western
stockholders”.
as
we
show
in
our
brief
if
we
have
zero
earnings,
there
would
still
be
a
contribution
to
norfolk
&
western
of
six
million
dollars
in
net
income
through
the
tax
deduction
by
filing
a
consolidated
return.
that's
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
your
honor,
there
is
not.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
are
some
conditions,
but
they're
minor
and
they
relate
to
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
judge
friendly
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
theoretically,
that
is
a
possibility
your
honor,
and
if
the
norfolk
&
western
violates
the
contracts
that
these
bondholders
have
or
if
they
deal
with
them
in
a
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
oh,
i
suggest
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
they
would
your
honor
if
they
do
what
you
suggest
because
they
would
--
the
only
way
they
can
do
that
is
by
diverting
traffic
improperly
away
from
the
norfolk
&
western.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
judge
friendly
said
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
they
have
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
and
i
agree
with
him.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i'm
sure
they
will
tell
you
that
they
do
not.
now,
i
mentioned
1967
earnings
only
in
passing.
the
commission
had
before
every
conceivable
kind
of
financial
information
from
the
beginning
of
1956
through
the
first
quarter
of
1967.
every
railroad
in
the
united
states
has
lost
revenue
this
year.
every
railroads
earnings
are
down.
our
first
six
months
showed
a
loss
of
$7.7
million.
for
the
new
york
central,
the
first
six
months
of
1966,
they
made
$36.6
million
and
in
the
first
six
months
of
1967,
they
lost
$2.6
million.
but
pennsylvania
was
down
from
$33
million
to
$7
million.
even
the
norfolk
&
western
which
is
building
in
this
$29
million
of
annual
operating
savings
went
down
from
$71
million
to
$54
million.
the
process
of
judicial
review
just
can't
work
if
on
six
months
more
of
earnings,
this
court
will
send
it
back
to
the
commission
for
a
new
consideration
because
we'll
just
go
on
doing
that
forever.
it
will
always
change.
now
i
want
to
turn
to
the
findings
that
both
the
district
court
made
and
the
commission
made
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
and
b
&
m.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
this
respect
the
map
i
think
maybe
particularly
helpful,
but
i
first
call
to
the
court's
attention
judge
friendly's
finding
on
page
57
of
the
opinion
in
which
he
states,
“the
record
which
contain
not
only
a
study
of
the
gains
from
inclusion
of
all
three
roads,
the
four-way
study,
but
studies
of
the
gains
from
the
inclusion
of
each
supports
the
earnings
ratio
established
for
e-l
even
on
the
assumption
that
neither
d
&
h
nor
b
&
m
is
included”.
the
commission
expressly
found
and
ordered
erie-lack
--
the
norfolk
&
western
to
include
erie-lackawanna
even
if
neither
b
&
a
--
b
&
m
nor
d
&
h
were
included.
in
the
reply
of
n
&
w
to
the
petitions
of
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
for
reconsideration,
n
&
w
did
not
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration
but
in
their
reply,
they
said
in
passing,
“the
commission's
findings
are
based
upon
the
explicit
premise
that
all
three
of
the
petitioners
will
be
included.”
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
expressly
said
that
norfolk
&
western
was
wrong
and
repeated
the
order
and
the
finding
directing
norfolk
&
western
to
include
erie-lackawanna
in
norfolk
&
western
even
if
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
not
included.
now
n
&
w
says
those
findings
are
inadequate
because
they
say,
this
court
must
assume
that
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
stockholders
were
both
to
reject
these
terms
and
because
the
court
must
further
assume
that
if
they
do,
d
&
h
and
erie-lackawanna's
value
relative
to
the
norfolk
&
western
will
be
substantially
reduced.
now
if
the
stockholders
both
know
there
are
four
possibilities
that
the
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
stockholders
both
know,
first,
they
will
stay
independent.
second,
they
will
be
included
in
penn-central.
third,
they
will
become
involved
in
a
new
england
system
which
is
what
mr.
dumaine
of
the
norfolk
--
of
the
delaware
&
hudson
has
in
mind
and
that's
what
this
letter
relates
to.
and
third,
they
will
be
included
forth
--
they
will
be
included
in
an
n
&
w-c
&
o
system.
i
say,
the
only
alternative
that
the
commission
have
to
concern
itself
with,
the
only
possible
alternative
it
could
have
considered
is
that
the
two
railroad
would
remain
independent
because
any
future
consolidation
involving
penn-central
or
new
england
system
or
anything
you
want,
any
future
consisting
--
system
--
consolidation
requires
commission
approval
under
section
5.
i
cannot
imagine
the
interstate
commerce
commission
creating
a
monopoly
in
all
of
new
england,
northern
new
york,
the
rail
service
simply
because
that
the
stockholders
of
the
d
&
h
and
the
b
&
m
will
have
it
no
other
way.
but
let
us
assume
that
they
did
make
such
a
finding.
the
commission
would
still
have
the
power
and
be
required
to
condition
that
finding
upon
terms
and
conditions
which
would
at
least
attempt
to
continue
to
promote
competition
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
through
the
erie-lackawanna's
connection
with
the
d
&
h
(inaudible).
that
is
the
time
to
consider
what
the
problem
is,
to
measure
what
the
problem
is,
the
commission
has
shown
through
appendix
g
of
the
penn-central
case
that
it
is
capable
of
doing
that
and
that
is
the
time
to
let
them
do
it.
but
let
me
just
refer
to
this
map
and
show
you
what
the
facts
--
the
basic
simple
facts
in
light
of
this.
erie-lackawanna
and
norfolk
&
western
will
have
revenues
of
$850
million
and
freight
revenues
of
about
$815
million.
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
will
have
revenues
of
about
$100
million
and
freight
revenues
of
about
$90
million.
the
only
thing
we're
concerned
with
is
east-west
traffic.
this
--
the
east-west
traffic
presently
moves
from
the
erie-lackawanna
to
the
delaware
&
hudson
at
binghamton,
new
york
and
delaware
&
hudson
then
carries
it
150
miles
to
the
b
&
m
and
gives
it
to
the
b
&
m
a
mechanic
bill.
the
bulk
of
all
east
bound
and
west
bound
traffic
on
those
railroads
now
moves
that
way.
there
are
only
two
present,
possible,
physical
alternatives.
first,
the
b
&
m
on
east
--
on
west
bound
traffic
that
give
it
to
the
new
york
central
at
mechanic
bill,
rotterdam
junction.
that
would
cut
the
d
&
h
out
of
the
movement
entirely,
but
the
boston
&
maine
doesn't
do
that
today.
the
reason
they
--
today,
deliver
it
three
times
as
much
the
d
&
h
as
they
do
to
the
b
&
m
at
the
same
place
--
i'm
sorry.
they
deliver
three
times
as
much
to
the
d
&
h
as
they
do
to
the
central
at
the
same
place.
they
deliver
it
to
the
new
york
central
only
that
traffic
which
new
york
central
has
to
terminate.
the
reason
is
perfectly
simple.
on
this
map,
we
don't
have
the
new
york
central
but
the
new
york
central
has
a
line
that
runs
from
albany
to
boston
through
springfield
and
worcester
that
the
b
&
m
starts
giving
away
his
traffic
to
the
new
york
central,
it
only
a
matter
of
days
until
the
new
york
central
reaches
back
in
to
the
same
origin,
and
picks
the
traffic
up
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
the
reason
why
b
&
m
doesn't
give
it
today.
the
d
&
h
could
carry
the
traffic
given
to
it
by
the
b
&
m
down
to
the
pennsylvania
at
wilkes-barre.
it
doesn't
do
that
today
for
two
perfectly
good
reasons.
one
is
because
the
route
is
circuitous.
the
pennsylvania
has
to
carry
it
south
to
harrisburg
to
put
it
on
the
main
line
of
the
pennsylvania.
the
other
reason
is
because
it's
not
economic.
the
d
&
h
does
not
receive
enough
money
for
carrying
out
the
additional
distance
beyond
bringing
it
up
until
wilkes-barre
so
it
doesn't
do
it.
and
let's
assume
a
penn-central
system
and
assume
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
remained
independent
or
that
mr.
dumaine's
idea,
dream
of
a
new
england
system
becomes
a
reality,
what
happens
to
the
traffic?
first,
you
have
to
understand
that
under
the
penn-central
plan
of
operation,
all
traffic
originating
or
terminating
west
of
youngstown,
ohio
and
destined
to
or
from
new
england
or
the
state
of
new
york
will
move
on
the
new
york
central
main
line.
but
the
main
line
of
the
new
york
central
runs
north
from
new
york
city
through
albany
where
it
gears
directly
west
and
runs
along
the
southern
border
of
the
great
lakes,
the
so-called
new
york
central
water
level
route.
new
york
central
is
building
a
big
yard
at
albany,
the
selkirk
yard
and
all
traffic
will
move
through
that
yard.
alright,
what
happens?
this
is
the
problem
that
mr.
shapp
and
scranton
have.
they
--
downgrading
of
the
pennsylvania
main
line
through
pennsylvania
and
moving
all
the
traffic
up
to
the
new
york
central.
what
happens
to
d
&
h
and
b
&
m?
it's
conceivable
that
the
d
&
h
will
give
west
bound
traffic
to
the
new
york
central
at
albany
and
cut
itself
out
of
the
hall
entirely,
its
150
miles
from
albany
to
binghamton.
the
d
&
h
might
as
well
go
out
of
business
as
gives
its
traffic
to
the
new
york
central.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
no
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
possible
way
that
the
traffic
can
move
except
over
the
erie-lackawanna,
no
possible
way.
the
traffic
--
the
commission
said
that
the
railroads
are
interdependent.
they
are
but
the
d
&
h
and
the
b
&
m
are
dependent
upon
the
erie-lackawanna.
it's
not
the
other
way
around.
the
d
&
h
is
not
going
to
solicit
traffic
east
bound
for
the
new
york
central
because
that
just
eliminates
the
d
&
h
from
any
movement.
that's
preposterous.
same
thing
is
true
about
the
b
&
m.
in
addition
to
the
new
york
central
which
they
presently
have
this
competition
in
new
england,
they're
going
to
have
the
new
haven.
they're
not
going
to
give
their
traffic
away
to
the
new
york
central
system
or
the
penn-central
system
anymore
than
they
presently
give
it
away
in
new
york
central.
there
aren't
any
other
alternatives.
well,
there
is
a
possibility
you
might
--
theoretically,
you
might
take
it
up
to
canada
and
move
it
above
the
great
lakes,
that's
the
other
physical
possibility
but
that
is
not
a
realistic
one.
now
the
traffic
studies
which
i
will
not
try
to
describe
except
to
say
this
about
the
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
we
made
five
traffic
studies.
we
studied
our
own
traffic.
we
studied
two-way
merger,
two-way
control,
four-way
merger,
four-way
control
and
we
studied
the
impact
of
penn-central
on
a
merged
norfolk
&
western-erie-lackawanna
system.
the
reason
we
studied
it
on
a
merged
system
is
because
what
we
have
proposed
was
a
two-step
merger.
the
first
step
was
control,
the
second
step
with
merger
and
we
suggested
a
number
of
ways
by
which
the
norfolk
&
western
could
take
care
of
the
debt
problem
when
we
pointed
out
that
there
at
least
$15
million
of
additional
operating
savings
through
merger
and
we
think
the
norfolk
&
western
will
merge
with
erie-lackawanna
in
due
course.
but
the
commission
concluded
there
should
not
be
a
merger.
the
norfolk
&
western
did
not
make
any
studies
at
all
of
its
own
traffic.
they
simply
presented
critiques
of
our
traffic.
all
of
their
critiques
of
all
of
our
traffic
studies
were
rejected
by
the
commission.
n
&
w
made
one
more
traffic
study
and
that
was
a
four-way
control
study
of
the
impact
of
penn-central
on
the
package
that
mr.
trienens
said
this
morning.
they
did
not
make
or
try
to
make
or
suggested
the
commission
that
there
ought
to
be
made
a
study
which
would
give
the
evidence
which
n
&
w
now
says
the
commission
should
have
had
with
respect
of
breaking
these
down
in
two-way
control.
now,
the
--
our
brief
makes
clear
how
the
studies
that
are
in
the
record
bear
out
with
the
physical
facts
that
i've
tried
to
show
to
you
by
the
map
suggests.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
this
is
why
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
am
arguing
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i'm
arguing
that
the
problem
is
so
small
and
so
insignificant
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
that
it
is
not
and
that
the
findings
that
were
made
by
the
commission
are
perfectly
adequate
to
deal
with
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
this
is
a
tempest
in
the
teapot,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
i
don't
think
you
do
your
honor.
i
think
you
should
--
because
i
think
i
indicated
in
the
beginning,
assume
that
the
commission's
order
will
be
carried
out.
i
don't
think
that
any
other
proper
or
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
--
if
any
other
assumption
is
proper.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
justice
fortas
that
is
all
the
commission
can
do.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir,
you
do
not.
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
seems
to
me
it
ends
the
judicial
job,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
--
if
you
get
any
deeper
than
that,
i
don't
know
where
you're
in.
you
just
keep
going
back
and
forth.
let
me
end
by
saying
simply
this
that
unlike
many
of
the
records
that
have
been
before
this
court
in
some
of
these
merger
proceedings
where
the
applicants
only
presented
evidence
where
the
evidence
was
not
cross-examined,
where
the
parties
did
not
present
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
every
single
bit
of
evidence
in
this
case
was
vigorously
brought
over
by
all
of
the
parties.
this
record
is
thorough,
it's
extensive
that
it
contains
nothing
but
hard
realistic
facts
that
all
counsel
have
had
more
than
their
day
in
court
to
challenge.
it
may
not
be
a
perfect
order.
there
may
be
no
perfect
resolution
to
this
problem
in
the
east
but
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
commission's
order
is
the
best
that
anyone
could
reasonably
expect
and
it
ought
to
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
thank
you,
sir.
