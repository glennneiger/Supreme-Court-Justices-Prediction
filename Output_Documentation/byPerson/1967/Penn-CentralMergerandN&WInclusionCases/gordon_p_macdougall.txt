mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
gordon
macdougall.
i
appear
here
for
the
city
of
scranton
and
mr.
shapp.
our
ultimate
objective
is
to
secure
a
hearing
in
a
district
court
without
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
the
failure
to
prosecute
in
the
penn-central
case
hanging
over
our
heads
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
we
were
never
parties
to
the
norfolk
and
western
inclusion
case
in
the
new
york
court.
we
claimed
we've
not
had
our
day
in
court
on
either
of
these
two
icc
orders.
our
dismissal
with
prejudice
in
penn-central
was
made
despite
our
motion
for
leave
to
withdraw,
despite
the
fact
that
the
united
states
and
the
commission
never
even
answered
our
intermitting
complaints
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right,
we
want
a
hearing
on
that.
we
want
to
clear
this
dismissal
with
prejudice
in
penn-central.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
are
afraid.
we'll
put
it
this
way.
the
answer
of
united
states
to
us
in
the
pennsylvania
district
court
is
that
it's
res
judicata
as
to
penn-central.
they
stayed
us
all
summer
long
and
therefore
we
would
like
to
alleviate
this
res
judicata.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
oh,
we're
going
to
have
a
hearing
next
week.
it's
december
15th.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
we
filed
our
briefs
in
the
penn-central
and
the
inclusion
case
in
the
pennsylvania
court
and
the
government
will
answer
that
on
december
13th.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it's
on
the
permanent
injunction
to
set
aside
the
orders
on
the
merger
and
the
inclusion
case,
both
consolidated
in
one
case.
and
the
hearing
is
next
friday
the
15th
and
the
court's
order
will
provide
for
reply
briefs
after
that.
i
would
imagine
that
the
case
would
be
probably
submitted
at
the
end
of
the
year,
ready
for
that
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
had
been
interveners
on
behalf
of
erie-lackawanna
in
september
1966.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we're
a
party
at
that
time.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
did
not
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
two
reasons,
no.
because
the
new
york
court
declined
to
consolidate
these
two
cases
for
pleadings,
briefings
and
hearing.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
our
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
what
happened
was
that
on
the
mandate
from
this
court
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
issued
an
order
on
mandate
from
this
court
in
which
they
just
kept
an
injunction
and
remanded
the
cause
completely
back
to
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
we
would
--
we
moved
to
withdraw
from
the
case.
we
had
served
honest
show
cause
order.
you
see,
the
railroads
and
the
government
met
with
the
judges
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
--
on
the
16th
of
june,
and
they
got
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
--
in
the
penn-central
case.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
we
cite
that
as
error
that
our
motion
to
withdraw
should've
been
granted,
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
that
is
a
--
it
wasn't
(inaudible),
i
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
were
given
until
august
2nd
to
attack
it
and
to
file
our
brief
six
days
later,
on
august
8th.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
(inaudible)
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
they
said
you
are
required
to
follow
it
or
be
dismissed
with
prejudice
in
penn-central.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
didn't
assert
it.
the
--
when
the
--
we
intervened
on
behalf
of
erie-lackawanna's
behalf
in
september
1966
and
when
you
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
that
court
sent
it
back
to
the
commission
and
then
the
case
was
over,
the
way
we
look
at
the
situation.
and
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
pardon?
we
intervened
on
behalf
of
erie-lack
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
in
the
district
court
in
september
1966.
we
were
here
before
you.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
they
sent
it
back.
they
issued
an
order
on
mandate,
right.
and
that's
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
at
pages
5
and
6.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
new
complaints
--
pardon?
supplemental
complaints
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
in
penn-central.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
there
wasn't.
it
was
specifically
asked
for
by
the
erie-lackawanna
railroad,
i
think
with
some
others
and
there
was
no
specific
retention.
you
see,
at
that
time,
everybody
thought
that
appendix
g
would
not
be
reimposed
because
you
people,
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
this
court
had
a
statement
in
it
that
these
controversial
conditions
wouldn't
happen.
well,
instead
of
the
cases
being
consolidated
at
the
icc
in
having
one
opinion
in
penn-central
and
in
inclusion
case
which
amended,
everyone
would
have
to
go
to
one
court,
the
commission
split
it.
and
so
at
the
time
the
order
on
mandate
came
down
from
the
district
court,
i'm
afraid
that
the
thinking
of
everybody
was
different
than
what
finally
came
to
pass.
i
think
the
only
thing
standing
in
the
way
of
orderly
judicial
review
of
penn-central
and
the
inclusion
case,
we
see,
it
is
the
cash
shortage
on
the
new
haven.
if
it
weren't
for
that,
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
good
but
the
new
haven
situation
is
pressing
a
--
is
pressing
us.
and
we
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
november
21st
report
of
the
commission
which
states
that
for
--
on
page
10
there,
it
says,
the
first
eight
months
of
1967,
the
new
haven
sustained
a
cash
attrition
of
at
least
5.3
million.
the
trustees
now
state
before
you
on
page
8
of
their
motion
that
the
cash
attrition
for
the
first
ten
months
was
only
5.17
million
which
shows
an
improvement
of
the
new
haven
situation.
at
the
november
21st
icc
report
estimates
that
the
new
haven
will
have
3.1
million
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
now
trustees
tell
us
that
they'll
have
only
2.0
million
at
the
end
of
the
year.
there's
a
difference
of
1.1
million.
we
think
that
something
is
either
inconsistent
or
has
been
omitted
in
this
new
haven
situation.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
have
three
minutes
left.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
just
like
to
clarify
that
we
are
the
only
parties
attacking
the
public
interest
and
either
the
penn-central
or
the
inclusion
case.
those
cases
are
together
in
pennsylvania.
the
record
in
the
penn-central
case
was
never
before
the
district
court
of
new
york.
as
the
views
you
have
today,
the
basic
record
--
administrative
record
of
the
icc
was
not
placed
before
the
new
york
court
leading
up
to
that
april
6,
1966
order.
and
there
are
other
parties
out
in
pennsylvania
besides
us.
there
is
moosic
and
pottsville.
and
they
have
two
icc
orders
which
the
commission
and
united
states
say
are
wholly
interrelated,
that's
penn-central
and
the
inclusion
case
completely
intertwined
and
inextricably
intertwined.
and
the
merits
before
--
are
not
before
you
and
either
the
inclusion
case
or
the
penn-central
case
and
the
basic
reason
apart
from
all
of
the
procedural
reasons
why
we
did
not
go
forward
in
new
york
on
penn-central
was
because
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
parties
i
represent
believe
that
these
--
that
the
case
by
case
method
simply
will
not
work.
scranton
is
not
served
by
penn
or
central.
it
is
served
by
e-l,
d
&
h
and
the
cnj
and
they
can't
go
into
a
case
and
attack
penn-central
on
one
case
and
the
inclusion
case
in
another
case.
the
adverse
impact
of
the
inclusion
bringing
e-l
and
d
&
h
together
as
one
railroad
in
the
scranton
area
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
penn-central
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that's
the
position
we
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
record
here?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
gordon
macdougall.
i
appear

for

our

other
parties
out
in
pennsylvania
besides
us.
there
is
moosic
and
pottsville.
and
they
have
two
icc
orders
which
the
commission
and
united
states
say
are
wholly
interrelated,
that's
penn-central
and
the
inclusion
case
completely
intertwined
and
inextricably
intertwined.
and
the
merits
before
--
are
not
before
you
and
either
the
inclusion
case
or
the
penn-central
case
and
the
basic
reason
apart
from
all
of
the
procedural
reasons
why
we
did
not
go
forward
in
new
york
on
penn-central
was
because
the
city
of
scranton
and
the
parties
i
represent
believe
that
these
--
that
the
case
by
case
method
simply
will
not
work.
scranton
is
not
served
by
penn
or
central.
it
is
served
by
e-l,
d
&
h
and
the
cnj
and
they
can't
go
into
a
case
and
attack
penn-central
on
one
case
and
the
inclusion
case
in
another
case.
the
adverse
impact
of
the
inclusion
bringing
e-l
and
d
&
h
together
as
one
railroad
in
the
scranton
area
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
penn-central
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that's
the
position
we
--
mr.
gordon

the
record
here?
