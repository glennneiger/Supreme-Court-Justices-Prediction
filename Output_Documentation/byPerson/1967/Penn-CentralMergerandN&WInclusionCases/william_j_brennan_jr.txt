justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
district
court
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that's
over
because
the
district
court

it
back
to
the
commission.

j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't

--
justice

in
light
of

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
about
judicial
review
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
about
judicial
review
of
that
--
whether
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
auerbach.
is
your
answer
to
justice
harlan,
does
that
imply
that
the
--
this
case
must
be
decided
by
the
first
week
in
january
if
the
new
haven
is
not
to
blow
away?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
respective
rights,
whatever
they
need
maybe
of
the
various
securities
of
the
new
haven.
will
all
of
--
after
this
merger
is
consummated
be
reflected
in
a
new
security
whatever
is
the
bankruptcy
court
takes
over,
is
that
it,
after
the
plan
of
reorganization
goes
through.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
will
be
in
the
bankruptcy
court
where
the
respective
interest
in
that
stock
will
be
determined
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
--
what
the
ultimate
result
of
this
is
that
penn-central
takes
over
some
kind
of
operating
facility
whatever
its
value
maybe
and
all
the
risks
of
property
loss
on
its
operation
as
part
of
the
integrated
new
penn-central
system,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
penn-central
must
--
judgment
must
be
that
there
are
other
values
even
if
it's
losing
operation,
to
the
merger
which
makes
the
merger
roll
--
overall
of
their
best
interest,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
whatever
this
arrangement
is
now,
penn-central
can't
get
out
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
--
if
the
merger
is
approved,
it
must
go
forward
and
whatever
the
result,
penn-central
is
stuck
with
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it's
--
suppose
it
was
a
review
of
it,
of
this
recent
order
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
should
see,
and
could
happen
i
expect
that
the
commission
might
be
reversed
and
then
they
go
back
to
the
commission
for
something
else,
something
better
for
that,
what's
penn-central's
position
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
