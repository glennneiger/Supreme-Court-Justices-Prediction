mr.
malcolm
fooshee
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
mutual
life
insurance
companies
owning
some
$30
million
of
bonds
in
the
erie-lackawanna.
at
the
very
outset,
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
we
do
not
oppose
the
immediate
inclusion
of
e-l
in
the
n
&
w
system.
we
do
not
ask
for
a
stay
of
the
icc's
order
of
approval.
we
ask
only
that
it
would
be
made
clear
that
under
that
part
of
the
order
which
retains
jurisdiction
in
the
icc,
e-l
bondholders
will
have
the
right
to
apply
for
relief
if
n
&
w,
an
important
competitor
of
e-l,
should
abuse
the
control
of
e-l
which
the
plan
approved
by
the
commission
gives
it.
this
basic
protection,
we
have
consistently
requested
from
the
first
time
when
we
were
allowed
to
intervene
before
the
commission.
our
need
for
such
protection
stems
from
the
fact
that
e-l,
to
be
a
new
corporation
to
be
formed
only
to
take
over
e-l's
present
assets
and
assume
its
debts
is
to
be
completely
controlled
by
n
&
w
which
parallels
and
competes
vigorously
with
e-l's
most
important
line
between
chicago
and
buffalo.
while
the
commission
spent
many
pages
in
finding
that
the
stock
ratios
to
e-l
were
fair,
it
made
no
findings
whatsoever
to
the
effect
of
this
plan
on
the
rights
of
e-l
bondholders.
indeed,
it
didn't
even
mention
their
objections.
now
n
&
w
has
argued
here
that
erie's
bondholders
said
they
rather
see
e-l
go
bankrupt
and
modify
its
staff.
none
of
appellant
bondholder
here
your
honors
ever
made
such
a
statement.
we
did
decline
to
approve
a
drastic
modification
presented
to
us
in
a
matter
of
days
by
e-l's
management
on
a
take
it
or
leave
it
basis.
we
have
never
been
presented
with
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
reasonable
modification.
now
section
5
(2)
specific
requirements
apply
in
favor
of
bondholders
as
well
as
stockholders
that
any
plan
under
section
5
(2)
must
be
fair.
indeed,
precisely
because
unlike
stockholders,
bondholders
lack
the
power
to
vote,
approval
or
disapproval
of
a
plan,
bondholders
are
the
ones
most
absolutely
dependent
on
the
commission's
protection.
now
the
need
of
bondholders
for
protectionhere
cannot,
we
submit,
be
seriously
questioned.
first
of
all,
n
&
w
would
henceforth
--
will
henceforth
be
in
a
position
to
divert
to
its
parallel
route
at
e-l's
expense,
much
of
e-l's
very
important
chicago-buffalo
traffic.
indeed,
there
is
a
positive
threat
that
n
&
w
may
do
so.
a
joint
report
on
merger
issued
by
committee
of
n
&
w
and
e-l
operating
representatives
before
a
proposal
of
this
controlled
grant
concluded
and
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
by
downgrading
to
a
single
track,
e-l's
parallel
route
in
double
tracking
its
own
and
by
certain
additional
unifications,
n
&
w
could
realize
about
$17
million
a
year
in
operating
savings
as
opposed
to
about
$1.8
million
back
can
--
that
were
allowable
within
the
realms
of
control,
bounds
of
control
alone.
but
there
is
nothing
to
assure
that
n
&
w
will
stay
within
the
narrow
limits
contemplated
by
the
commission
once
it
acquires
control
and
becomes
in
fact
the
sole
stockholder
of
e-l.
on
the
contrary,
e-l
itself
insisted
in
april
in
persuading
the
commission
to
approve
this
plan
that
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
n
&
w
will
not
by
the
early
1970's
obtain
that
enormous,
almost
10
times
larger,
potential
gain
by
merger.
and
i
quote
on
what
e-l
said,
“unless
n
&
w
finds,
it
can
obtain
most
of
that
potential
gain
while
e-l
is
merely
a
100%
controlled
subsidiary”.
moreover,
there's
a
further
particularly
imperative
need
for
protection
here
where
e-l's
bonds
include
more
than
$70
million
of
income
bonds
whose
interest
of
$3
million
a
year
is
contingent
on
earnings
of
e-l's
own
line.
its
earnings
will
depend
on
n
&
w's
decisions
not
only
as
to
traffic
routings
but
as
to
operating
expenses,
allocations
of
shared
overheads,
and
the
like.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
yes
indeed.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
it
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
it's
a
very
complicated
proposal
your
honor
which
in
saying
that
we
had
rejected
it,
neither
e-l
nor
n
&
w
nor
any
other
parties
who've
complained
about
are
not
having
taken
this
take
it
or
leave
it
--
have
seen
fit
to
describe
either
to
the
court
below
or
to
you.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
yes
--
it
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
commend
it.
i
commend
it
to
your
examination
your
honor.
it
is
so
drastic
as
well
as
being
complicated
and
we
think
violates
all
priorities.
of
course
nothing
was
to
be
done
of
e-l's
stock
but
it
was
the
drastic
feature
of
this
and
a
very
complicated
matter.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
it
was
put
before
the
commission,
the
commission
never
mentioned
it.
it
was
in
the
great
record
of
very
high
documents.
but
the
theory
of
the
other
side
seems
to
be
that
an
offer
is
made
to
us
unless
we
accept
it,
we
have
no
right
to
have
its
fairness
examined.
no
comment
ever
made
on
it.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
we
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
a
reservation
--
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
what
would
cost
more,
your
honor?
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
we
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
your
honor,
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
negotiate.
our
vote
is
not
called
for
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
section
5
(2)
your
honor
requires
no
vote
from
stockholders
at
all.
5
(2)
never
contemplated
in
our
opinion
that
it
would
be
used
as
a
debt
reduction
proceeding.
it,
as
this
court
has
said,
time
and
again,
is
essentially
a
consensual
proceeding.
stockholders
agree
on
--
of
two
roads
on
merger,
one
road
wants
to
acquire
control
and
it
acquires
as
much
control
as
it
can
but
there
maybe
minority
stockholders.
there
is
no
compulsion
in
--
under
5
(2).
bondholders
have
never
been
dealt
with
this
way
before.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
they
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
we
merely
want
to
have
a
reservation
to
come
back
to
the
commission
if
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
control
beyond
what
the
commission
contemplate,
beyond
what
the
commission
contemplated
or
should
have
contemplated
as
bounds
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
we
would
hope
that
the
imposition
that
the
clarification
that
this
retention
of
jurisdiction
which
the
commission
has
made.
first,
it
made
it
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
plan.
then
after
it
heard
our
argument,
we
filed
our
exceptions,
we
filed
our
brief,
it
broadened
that
to
reserve
jurisdiction
to
enter
orders
which
are
whatever
insofar
as
they
might
be
appropriate.
now
this
we
think
ought
to
apply
to
us.
we
believe
the
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
yes,
we
would
like.
we
have
never
been
mentioned
before.
this
may
well
apply
to
us.
it
may
be
broad
enough.
but
when
we
have
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
not
at
all,
you
--
well,
there
will
be
a
reservation
so
that
if
n
&
w
steps
over
the
bounds
and
its
control,
we
can
come
back
and
apply
to
the
commission
and
ask
them
to
require
it
to
stay
within
the
bounds.
but
this
conclusion,
this
consummation
of
the
inclusion
proceeding
and
it
can
go
forward
immediately.
this
would
cause
no
delay.
this
court
could
enter
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
it
will
--
it
may
well
cause,
and
i
will
hope
to
show
you
in
just
a
moment
that
the
earning
power
can
be
taken
from
behind
our
bonds
that
no
--
for
50
years,
n
&
w
can
see
that
no
interest
is
payable
on
all
these
more
than
$70
million
income
bonds
which
at
$3
million
a
year,
they
mature
in
2015
and
2020,
$50
--
to
50
at
$3
million
a
year
for
50
years
is
more
than
a
100
--
is
about
$150
million
and
if
that's
compounded,
it's
enormously
beyond
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
hope
--
we
think
this
will
cause
no
delay
to
enter
such
a
mandate
as
was
entered
in
the
railway
executives
case
in
379
u.s.
thank
you.

mr.
malcolm
fooshee
yes,
we
would
like.
we
have
never
been
mentioned
before.
this
may
well
apply
to
us.
it
may
be
broad
enough.
but
when
we
have
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
not
at
all,
you
--
well,
there
will
be
a
reservation
so
that
if
n
&
w
steps
over
the
bounds
and
its
control,
we
can
come
back
and
apply
to
the
commission
and
ask
them
to
require
it
to
stay
within
the
bounds.
but
this
conclusion,
this
consummation
of
the
inclusion
proceeding
and
it
can
go
forward
immediately.
this
would
cause
no
delay.
this
court
could
enter
--
mr.
malcolm
fooshee
it
will
--
it
may
well
cause,
and
i
will
hope
to
show
you
in
just
a
moment
that
the
earning
power
can
be
taken
from
behind
our
bonds
that
no
--
for
50
years,
n
&
w
can
see
that
no
interest
is
payable
on
all
these
more
than
$70
million
income
bonds
which
at
$3
million
a
year,
they
mature
in
2015
and
2020,
$50
--
to
50
at
$3
million
a
year
for
50
years
is
more
than
a
100
--
is
about
$150
million
and
if
that's
compounded,
it's
enormously
beyond
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
hope
--
we
think
this
will
cause
no
delay
to
enter
such
a
mandate
as
was
entered
in
the
railway
executives
case
in
379
u.s.
thank
you.
