mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
expedition
of
this
proceeding
before
this
court
under
necessary
shortening
of
the
discussion
of
the
issues
which
this
entails
in
the
papers
filed
with
you.
i
may
not
be
entirely
fair
to
the
n
&
w
in
what
i'm
about
to
say
but
i
think
it
follows
from
their
papers
in
this
court
that
n
&
w
raises
no
issue
at
all
as
to
fairness
to
n
&
w
of
the
terms
for
d
&
h
inclusion
except
its
point
concerning
the
absence
of
a
basis
for
including
d
&
h
in
n
&
w,
unless
b
&
m
is
also
in
fact
included.
this
claim
of
n
&
w
with
this
--
in
this
regard
is
based
on
its
theory
that
mr.
trienens
advanced
this
morning
in
which
you
will
see
repeated
a
number
of
times
in
the
november
30th
brief
that
n
&
w
was
expected
to
acquire
these
three
roads
only
as
a
package.
and
as
you
will
see
from
that
brief,
that
whole
argument
is
predicated
on
that
theory
and
this
theory
of
a
package
or
that
the
commission
has
predicated
its
findings
on
the
theory
of
a
package
is
absurd
on
its
face.
the
commission
did
no
such
thing.
it
obviously
did
not
because
it
expressly
provided
for
e-l's
inclusion
without
either
d
&
h
or
b
&
m
and
for
d
&
h's
inclusion
without
b
&
m.
instead
of
predicating
its
decision
on
such
a
package
concept,
the
commission
predicated
its
conclusions
on
the
facts
of
geography
and
its
determination
to
provide
as
much
direct
competition
for
penn-central
as
it
can
through
piecemeal
inclusion
in
n
&
w
of
these
three
roads.
now
the
reason
for
that
is
geographical.
mr.
barr
has
already
pointed
out
to
you
that
the
e-l
is
has
an
end
to
end
connection
between
the
n
&
w
at
buffalo
and
the
d
&
h
at
bingham
--
binghamton,
d
&
h
is
likewise
a
line
that
is
an
end
to
end
connection
between
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
boston
&
maine.
and
the
boston
&
maine
goes
on
from
the
albany
area
to
boston
and
to
portland.
and
these
facts
of
geography
coupled
with
the
natural
economic
forces
of
competition
to
which
mr.
barr
referred
in
connection
with
e-l
that
makes
it
equally
true
that
if
b
&
m
is
not
in
fact
included
but
chooses
to
remain
an
independent
carrier,
the
competition
from
penn-central
which
b
&
m
will
face
within
new
england
will
tend
to
force
b
&
m
to
work
even
more
closely
than
it
does
today
with
d
&
h,
e-l
and
n
&
w
assuming
that
d
&
h
accepts
the
terms.
now
we've
shown
in
our
papers
that
the
terms
generally
for
d
&
h
inclusion
are
fair
to
n
&
w
whether
or
not
b
&
m
is
included.
so
i
will
now
turn
to
the
question
which
had
been
raised
at
some
length
in
these
arguments
today
of
whether
d
&
h
will
in
fact
accept
the
inclusion
on
the
present
terms
assuming
the
commission's
order
in
the
inclusion
case
as
upheld
by
this
court.
this
question
appears
to
be
of
significance
only
on
the
issue
raised
by
n
&
w
as
to
the
fairness
of
the
e-l
terms
if
d
&
h
is
not
included.
the
speculation
on
this
question
has
centered
on
the
fact
that
mr.
dumaine
who
i
must
point
out
has
been
president
of
the
d
&
h
only
since
august
1
of
this
year,
has
stated
that
he
was
searching
for
an
alternative
which
might
be
more
in
the
interest
of
d
&
h
stockholder.
in
its
jurisdictional
statements
and
its
briefs
and
in
its
argument
today,
n
&
w
would
have
you
believe
that
mr.
du
--
that
the
alternative
that
mr.
dumaine
is
looking
for
is
inclusion
of
d
&
h
in
the
penn-central
system.
they
know
better.
i
categorically
denied
it
as
i
categorically
denied
it
in
the
court
below
the
only
system
that
mr.
dumaine
has
considered
as
a
possible
alternative
is
what
he
refers
to
as
a
new
england
system
opposed
to
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
together
and
such
other
new
england
roads
as
maybe
interested
in
joining
in.
now
they've
said
we've
negotiated
with
penn-central
in
effect
because
you'll
see
in
the
november
30th
brief
a
reference
to
our
attempting
to
use
these
terms
as
a
floor
for
further
negotiation.
there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
this
implication
that
we
have
negotiated.
it
is
false
and
there
is
no
intention
of
negotiating
it.
and
even
if
there
were,
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
any
sensible
man
to
think
you
could
come
out
with
better
terms
for
inclusion
in
penn-central
after
reecting
the
n
&
w
inclusion
terms
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
provided
that
we
cannot
be
included
mandatorily
in
penn-central.
we're
up
against
an
attempt
voluntarily
to
persuade
penn-central
to
pay
us
better
terms
after
they
have
completely
surrounded
us
by
going
to
--
pennsylvania
going
to
albany
and
to
montreal
and
going
into
boston
by
this
boston
and
albany
line
center.
it
is
ridiculous
just
to
make
any
such
suggestion
that
it
is
penn-central
that
we
maybe
interested
in
looking
at.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
correct.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
we
certainly
do
want
it
to
be
approved
from
that
standpoint
and
as
far
as
we
know
today,
mr.
dumaine
may
never
come
up
with
a
proposal.
he
said
he
was
in
the
process
of
trying
to
formulate
one.
he
knows
that
there
is
some
dissatisfaction
among
the
b
&
m
stockholders
with
the
present
terms.
and
it
is
possible,
he
had
thought,
that
a
combination
of
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
going
it
along
together,
might
solve
the
problem
in
a
way
that
would
be
as
fair
or
fairer
than
the
terms
which
d
&
h
can
get
for
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
he
is
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
a
stockholder
as
well
as
president.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
mr.
barr
has
shown
that
the
record
would
support
the
inclusion
of
e-l
in
the
system
without
d
&
h
inclusion
and
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
add
one
point
because
i
wish
to
pick
direct
issue
with
the
solicitor
general's
remarks
that
we
are
in
a
position
to
or
want
to
try
to
hold
up
these
merger
matters.
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
and
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
connection
with
the
erie-lackawanna's
inclusion
whether
or
not
d
&
h
is
included,
is
the
fact
the
n
&
w
itself
induced
this
conclusion
of
the
commission
that
erie
should
be
included
whether
or
not
the
other
two
roads
are
included.
they
say
today,
that
if
included
at
all,
they
should
be
included
as
a
package.
i
defy
you
to
square
this
that
what
they
said
in
their
exceptions
to
the
commission
which
is
the
last
principal
document
they
filed
in
support
of
their
own
position.
when
they
said
in
their
conclusion,
any
order
for
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
should
be
conditioned
on
the
simultaneous
inclusion
of
the
other
end
of
e-l
but
they
never
said
that
the
inclusion
of
e-l
should
be
conditioned
on
the
simultaneous
or
any
other
inclusion
of
d
&
h
and
b
&
m.
they
have
deliberately
led
the
commission
into
believing
that
they
would
accept
e-l
inclusions
without
the
other
two
roads
and
the
reason
again
is
economic.
their
interest
in
coming
to
new
york
is
very
real
as
mr.
mcdermott
for
the
boston
&
maine
pointed
out
this
morning,
they
have
encouraged
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
might
even
go
in
the
penn-central
system.
they
have
done
this
not
only
by
saying
that
they
just
assumed
to
see
it
happened,
but
they
have
said
publicly
to
encourage
the
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
stockholders
that
they
would
get
a
better
price
if
they
went
with
penn-central.
this
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
n
&
w
simply
to
offset
the
terms
for
the
inclusion
of
these
three
roads
if
they
possibly
can
because
of
the
possibility
which
always
exists
that
the
stockholders
may
not
accept
the
opportunity
which
is
offered
to
them.
there
is
no
intention
on
the
part
of
d
&
h
to
hold
up
the
inclusion
of
e-l
as
i
have
just
said.
there
is
likewise
no
intention
on
the
part
of
d
&
h
to
hold
up
the
penn-central
merger.
it
is
the
position
that
the
delaware
&
hudson,
that
if
you
affirm
the
n
&
w
inclusion
cases,
i
think
you
should,
the
penn-central
merger
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
immediate
consummation.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
expedition
of
this
proceeding
before
this
court
under
necessary
shortening
of
the
discussion
of
the

which
this

you.
i

in

unless

this
claim
of
n
&
w
with
this
--
in
this
regard
is
based
on
its
theory
that
mr.
trienens
advanced
this

in

only
as

and
as
you
will
see
from
that
brief,
that
whole
argument
is
predicated
on
that
theory
and
this
theory
of
a
package
or
that
the
commission
has
predicated
its

on
the

is
absurd
on
its

the

now
the
reason
for
that
is
geographical.
mr.
barr
has
already
pointed
out
to
you
that
the
e-l
is
has
an
end
to
end
connection
between
the
n
&
w
at
buffalo
and
the
d
&
h
at
bingham
--
binghamton,
d
&
h
is
likewise
a
line
that
is
an
end
to
end
connection
between
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
boston
&
maine.
and
the
boston
&
maine
goes
on
from
the
albany
area
to
boston
and
to
portland.
and
these
facts
of
geography
coupled
with
the
natural
economic
forces
of
competition
to
which
mr.
barr
referred
in
connection
with
e-l
that
makes
it
equally
true
that
if
b
&
m
is
not
in
fact
included
but
chooses
to
remain
an
independent
carrier,
the
competition
from
penn-central
which
b
&
m
will
face
within
new
england
will
tend
to
force
b
&
m
to
work
even
more
closely
than
it
does
today
with
d
&
h,
e-l
and
n
&
w
assuming
that
d
&
h
accepts
the
terms.
now
we've
shown
in
our

that

terms
generally
for
d
&

i

i
categorically

mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
he
is
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
a
stockholder
as
well
as
president.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
mr.
barr
has
shown
that
the
record
would
support
the
inclusion
of
e-l
in
the
system
without
d
&
h
inclusion
and
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
add
one
point
because
i
wish
to
pick
direct
issue
with
the
solicitor
general's
remarks
that
we
are
in
a
position
to
or
want
to
try
to
hold
up
these
merger
matters.
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
and
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
connection
with
the
erie-lackawanna's
inclusion
whether
or
not
d
&
h
is
included,
is
the
fact
the
n
&
w
itself
induced
this
conclusion
of
the
commission
that
erie
should
be
included
whether
or
not
the
other
two
roads
are
included.
they
say
today,
that
if
included
at
all,
they
should
be
included
as
a
package.
i
defy
you
to
square
this
that
what
they
said
in
their
exceptions
to
the
commission
which
is
the
last
principal
document
they
filed
in
support
of
their
own
position.
when
they
said
in
their
conclusion,
any
order
for
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
should
be
conditioned
on
the
simultaneous
inclusion
of
the
other
end
of
e-l
but
they
never
said
that
the
inclusion
of
e-l
should
be
conditioned
on
the
simultaneous
or
any
other
inclusion
of
d
&
h
and
b
&
m.
they
have
deliberately
led
the
commission
into
believing
that
they
would
accept
e-l
inclusions
without
the
other
two
roads
and
the
reason
again
is
economic.
their
interest
in
coming
to
new
york
is
very
real
as
mr.
mcdermott
for
the
boston
&
maine
pointed
out
this
morning,
they
have
encouraged
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
that
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
might
even
go
in
the
penn-central
system.
they
have
done
this
not
only
by
saying
that
they
just
assumed
to
see
it
happened,
but
they
have
said
publicly
to
encourage
the
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
stockholders
that
they
would
get
a
better
price
if
they
went
with
penn-central.
this
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
n
&
w
simply
to
offset
the
terms
for
the
inclusion
of
these
three
roads
if
they
possibly
can
because
of
the
possibility
which
always
exists
that
the
stockholders
may
not
accept
the
opportunity
which
is
offered
to
them.
there
is
no
intention
on
the
part
of
d
&
h
to
hold
up
the
inclusion
of
e-l
as
i
have
just
said.
there
is
likewise
no
intention
on
the
part
of
d
&
h
to
hold
up
the
penn-central
merger.
it
is
the
position
that
the
delaware
&
hudson,
that
if
you
affirm
the
n
&
w
inclusion
cases,
i
think
you
should,
the
penn-central
merger
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
immediate
consummation.
thank
you
your
honors.
