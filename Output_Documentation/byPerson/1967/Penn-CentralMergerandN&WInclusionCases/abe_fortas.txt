justice
abe
fortas
are
you
reading
the
mandate
of
this
court
as
requiring
the
--
that
there
be
some
provision
made
for
these
three
roads
acceptable
to
those
respective
roads
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instead
of
some
mandate,
instead
of
some
provision
made
for
--
which
would
give
them
a
reasonable
prospect
of
inclusion
in
one
of
the
systems,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
arguing
that
this
provision
that
was
made
for
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
was
inadequate,
unsatisfactory,
unreasonable
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
stay,
if
you
don't
mind,
i'd
like
to
stay
with
this
letter
that
you've
read
us
which
i
haven't
seen.
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
mr.
dumaine
or
anybody
else
says
that
they
didn't
like
the
proposal
made
for
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
in
the
n
&
w
system.
what
difference
does
it
make
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
terms
of
the
issues
before
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
talking
about
this
letter.
justice
abe
fortas
now
will
you
please
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
tell
me
about
this
letter.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
district
court's
conclusion
dependent
upon
the
consent
as
it
saw
--
out
of
the
d
&
h
board.
justice
abe
fortas
are
--
you're
saying
that
that
was
the
only
basis
that
the
district
court
had
as
shown
by
the
record
for
concluding
that
the
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
in
the
n
&
w
system
was
appropriately
provided
for.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
isaacs.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
isaacs,
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
aren't
you
confronting
us
--
this
court
with
a
dilemma
that
i
suppose
the
penn-central
offer
--
made
an
offer
to
new
haven,
suppose
that
were
approved
by
the
icc
and
the
district
court,
and
suppose
the
new
haven
rejected
the
offer
by
either
the
new
haven
or
some
appropriate
class
of
security
holders,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
from
what
you
say
that
the
--
hence
--
that
--
they
just
have
to
keep
that
process
up
until
something
were
done
that
was
satisfactory
to
the
new
haven,
the
trustees
and
the
appropriate
class
of
security
holders
or
that
the
penn-central
would
have
to
lease
the
new
haven
road
and
operate
it
on
a
lease
basis
and
even
that
would
assume
that
the
terms
of
the
lease
would
be
accepted
by
the
new
haven,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
who
would
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
who
would
be
at
whose
mercy?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
would
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they've
either
got
a
great
deal
of
power
or
not
quite
enough
power?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
but
the
concept
and
situation
of
this
sort
of
absolute
equality
of
bargaining
power,
sort
of
boggled
my
imagination.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcdermott,
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
i
clearly
understand
the
position
of
b
&
m
here.
are
you
asking
that
we
affirm
except
on
the
valuation
point?
justice
abe
fortas
except
for
valuation,
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
you're
asking
that
we
consider
valuation
at
this
time
and
that
we
remand
with
respect
to
the
valuation
point.
justice
abe
fortas
but
otherwise
that
we
affirm
the
order
below.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
the
only
opportunity
that
there
will
be
for
boston
and
maine
to
attack
the
exchange
ratio?
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
work?
why
do
we
have
to
pass
on
it
now?
justice
abe
fortas
this
has
not
been
accepted
by
boston
and
maine,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
they'd
submit
--
it
hasn't
been
submitted,
the
boston
and
maine?
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
--
won't
that
--
won't
there
be
a
proceeding,
subsequent
proceedings
when
it
is
submitted
to
boston
and
maine
and
isn't
that
the
time
when
the
exchange
ratio
will
be
right
for
judicial
consideration?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'd
wonder.
i'm
not
clear
on
this
from
--
apart
from
it.
but
i
wonder
if
these
exchange
ratios
are
right
for
our
consideration
at
this
time.
now,
i
can
understand
that
it
might
be
argued
that
since
exchange
ratios
have
not
been
finally,
conclusively
settled
for
all
the
time,
we
ought
not
to
permit
the
merger
to
go
into
effect.
that's
a
wonderful
line
of
argument.
but,
if
--
what
you
seemed
to
be
doing,
it's
argued
that
we
ought
to
review
the
exchange
ratio
at
this
time,
i
confess
i
have
some
problems
in
my
mind
because
the
exchange
ratios
are
not
final
in
the
sense
that
there
has
been
approval,
offer
and
acceptance,
and
administrative
approval.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
your
stockholders
agree
with
you
and
they
reject
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
under
such
a
situation
and
assuming
that
d
&
h
had
accepted
the
terms
proposed
for
them,
then
under
the
outstanding
orders
of
the
commission,
we
would
be
precluded
from
proceeding
in
penn-central
either
on
a
joint
application
with
penn-central
or
on
a
petition
filed
under
that
reserved
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
would
have
to
seek
our
home
elsewhere.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
not.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
your
position
entirely
either.
you
are
not
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
district
court's
order
of
permitting
the
merger
to
go
forward.
justice
abe
fortas
all
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
order
that
the
commission
have
a
hearing
on
your
--
the
grievance
that
you
communicated
to
us,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
has
a
proposal
been
made
to
the
bondholders?
has
a
proposal
been
made
which
bondholders
don't
like?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
the
proposal
in
terms
of
the
bondholders?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
it's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
too
complicated
for
us
to
consider?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
forgive
me
for
interrupting
your
argument.
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
opening
statement
which
you
said
that
nobody
opposes
the
merger
except
for
the
city
of
scranton
and
mr.
shapp.
is
that
true
of
the
b
&
o
and
n
&
w
who
are
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
but
it
is
quite
important.
i
got
the
impression
during
the
argument
that
the
position
of
the
b
&
o
and
the
n
&
w
was
that
the
merger
should
not
be
consummated
unless
the
inclusion
proceedings
were
first
consummated
and
consummated
in
a
way
that
they
consider
fair.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
really
does
amount
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
put
to
you
some
basic
propositions
here
related
to
the
colloquy
between
you
and
mr.
justice
white
and
let's
see
if
the
--
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
them.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
fundamental
problem
in
the
inclusion
prior
this
case
stems
from
the
conclusion
that
if
penn-central
merger
went
through
without
some
provision
being
made
or
viable
future
for
these
three
small
roads,
they
--
those
three
small
roads
would
be
injured
and
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
and
this
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
injury
to
the
public
interest
which
would
be
consequent
upon
that
eventuality
was
so
substantial
that
it
would
not
permit
the
merger
to
go
through
unless
something
were
done
about
it.
now,
are
you
--
are
we
together
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
far?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
point
one.
point
two,
the
question
which
we
now
have
before
us
it
seems
to
me
is
tentatively,
is
whether
the
net
of
that
reason
is
that
the
commission
had
to
provide
to
these
three
roads
a
fair
and
reasonable
alternative,
that
is
to
say,
whether
the
commission
had
to
offer
and
provide
for
the
offer
to
these
roads
of
a
specific
home
in
which
their
future
would
be
protected?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it's
not
of
--
now,
if
that
is
the
case
and
the
issue
before
us
is
not
whether
these
roads
will
or
will
not
accept
it
but
whether
the
commission
has
done
what
this
court
held
to
be
its
duty
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
commission
did
reserve
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
i
can't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
put
my
hands
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
can't
put
my
hands
on
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction
in
this
mass
of
papers
here
but
it
--
wasn't
there
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
net
of
it
is
that
norfolk
&
western
emerges
as
a
sole
--
would
emerge
as
the
sole
stockholder
of
erie
and
lackawanna?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
erie
and
lackawanna
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
remain
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
and
in
due
course,
erie
and
lackawanna
would
remain
as
corporate
entity
and
the
bondholders
of
erie
and
lackawanna
would
have
whatever
claim
they've
got.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
same
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
same
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i
missed
you.
is
that
true
even
though
d
&
h
has
not
--
doesn't
go
along?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
talking
about
is
true,
just
an
inclusion
limited
to
the
erie-lackawanna.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
the
earnings
of
erie
and
lackawanna
though
assuming
that
it
remained
as
a
separate
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
a
separate
entity?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
what
you're
saying
that
the
bondholders'
fear
of
a
hesitation
and
dilution
of
their
efforts
is
quite
farfetched.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
d
&
h-e
and
l
situation
comparable
to
appendix
g?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
fear
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
fear
of
the
bondholders
is
that
norfolk
&
western
as
emerging
as
a
sole
stockholder
of
e
&
l,
will
so
handle
the
fears
of
e
&
l
that
there
won't
be
any
interest
--
they
won't
pay
any
money
to
pay
their
--
the
interest
on
their
bonds.
justice
abe
fortas
theoretically,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
possibility.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
not
violating.
it
wouldn't
be
violating
contracts.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
have
a
question
as
to
whether
the
bondholders
have
a
remedy
against
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
your
remarks
here
is
making
a
concession
binding
on
norfolk
&
western.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
the
thrust
of
what
you're
telling
us
that
even
if
b
&
--
if
erie
and
lackawanna
were
the
only
one
included
in
the
d
&
h,
it
still
be
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
simplicity
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
you
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
all
these
on
the
assumption
of
--
assumption
that
we've
got
to
conclude
that
the
commission
did
not
err
in
saying
you
have
to
include
all
of
these
--
each
one
of
these
railroads
or
two
of
them
or
three
of
them?
are
you
assuming
that
the
commission
--
that
we
have
to
--
do
we
have
to
decide
or
do
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
commission
did
not
err
in
making
that
determination
or
if
we
--
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
should
say
that
it
was
error
for
the
commission
to
order
the
inclusion
of
these
roads,
one
of
them
or
two
of
them
if
they
didn't
know
--
go
on,
we
say
that
as
an
abstract
manner
that's
error.
then
you're
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
anyway
financially
so
far
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
erie
and
lackawanna
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
about
the
basis
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
alright,
let's
lay
the
teapot.
how
about
the
basic
proposition?
how
about
the
teapot?
you
--
are
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
commission
--
that
we
have
to
review
that
question
as
to
whether
if
only
one
of
these
roads
goes
along
with
this
and
not
all
three
of
them,
it
still
works
out
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
or
another
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
possibility,
i
mean
another
possibility
may
be
to
assume
that
all
the
commission
had
to
do
was
to
make
it
possible
for
any
one
of
these
three
roads
that
wanted
too
to
accept
a
fair
offer.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
if
that
is
correct,
do
we
have
to
go
any
further
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
out
whether
the
commission
made
sure
that
there
was
provision
opened
to
each
of
these
roads
for
inclusion
in
one
of
these
systems.
and
if
there
was
such
provision,
does
that
--
does
it
or
does
not
--
does
it
not
in
your
opinion
in
the
judicial
job?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
here
for
delaware
&
hudson?
justice
abe
fortas
and
mr.
dumaine
is
the
president
in
that,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
here
urging
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
below,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no
ifs,
ands,
and
buts
and
no
conditions,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
is
this
an
academic
exercise
or
an
indication
of
interest
in
the
public
welfare
or
do
we
assume
that
delaware
&
hudson,
in
spite
mr.
dumaine's
letter
wants
to
have
this
approval,
presumably,
so
that
it
can
be
appropriate
transactions
can
be
completed
and
the
matter
is
presented
to
the
stockholders
or
whatever
is
required
for
consummation,
is
that
a
fair
assumption?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
is
bound
by
what
you're
saying
today,
hasn't
he?
i
mean
i
don't
under
--
quite
understand
this.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
quite
understand
this.
you're
the
counsel
for
the
delaware
&
hudson.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
is
the
president
of
it.
so
i
assume
you're
speaking
for
him
in
that
capacity.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
that
explained
it.
i
got
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
cox,
do
we
have
to
pass
on
that
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
will
you
explain
that?
justice
abe
fortas
does
--
do
they
make
any
point
in
which
in
your
judgment
of
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
make
any
point
which
in
your
judgment
does
not
fall
within
that
category?
and
if
so
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
its
not
harsh
unless
(inaudible)
--
harsh,
mr.
cox,
unless
you
attack
different
significance
to
the
words
that
they
have
a
right
to
remain
independent
and
i
would
do
it,
that
is
--
they
have
a
right
to
remain
independent
if
they
can
cut
the
mustard,
i
think,
and
manage
to
do
it
as
an
economic
matter,
but
nothing
else
and
what
the
government
as
i
understand
the
theory,
doesn't
have
the
right,
doesn't
have
the
duty
to
assure
that
they
can
stay
in
existence
to
make
money.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
wants
us
to
affirm.
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
they
do
that?
perhaps
i
missed
you.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
they
decided.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
--
now
wait,
how
do
they
go
beyond
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
we're
ought
to
declare
appendix
g
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
we
did
that
then
that
would
force
these
roads
into
the
bosom
of
the
n
&
w,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
in
that
way,
you
want
them
to
get
rather
appendix
g
--
n
&
w
is
not
a
party
to
appendix
g.
it's
affected
by
them.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
--
you're
affected
by
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
appendix
g
ought
to
be
eliminated
and
that
means
that
these
roads
would
be
a
subject
of
the
siphoning
of
and
diversion
of
traffic
and
then
it
have
to
go
looking
for
somewhere
else
so
they
can
get
something
to
eat,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
reading
the
mandate
of
this
court
as
requiring
the
--
that
there
be
some
provision
made
for
these
three
roads
acceptable
to
those
respective
roads
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instead
of
some
mandate,
instead
of
some
provision
made
for
--
which
would
give
them
a
reasonable
prospect
of
inclusion
in
one
of
the
systems,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
arguing
that
this
provision
that
was
made
for
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
was
inadequate,
unsatisfactory,
unreasonable
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
stay,
if
you
don't
mind,
i'd
like
to
stay
with
this
letter
that
you've
read
us
which
i
haven't
seen.
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
mr.
dumaine
or
anybody
else
says
that
they
didn't
like
the
proposal
made
for
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
in
the
n
&
w
system.
what
difference
does
it
make
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
terms
of
the
issues
before
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
talking
about
this
letter.
justice
abe
fortas
now
will
you
please
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
tell
me
about
this
letter.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
district
court's
conclusion
dependent
upon
the
consent
as
it
saw
--
out
of
the
d
&
h
board.
justice
abe
fortas
are
--
you're
saying
that
that
was
the
only
basis
that
the
district
court
had
as
shown
by
the
record
for
concluding
that
the
inclusion
of
the
d
&
h
in
the
n
&
w
system
was
appropriately
provided
for.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
isaacs.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
isaacs,
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
aren't
you
confronting
us
--
this
court
with
a
dilemma
that
i
suppose
the
penn-central
offer
--
made
an
offer
to
new
haven,
suppose
that
were
approved
by
the
icc
and
the
district
court,
and
suppose
the
new
haven
rejected
the
offer
by
either
the
new
haven
or
some
appropriate
class
of
security
holders,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
from
what
you
say
that
the
--
hence
--
that
--
they
just
have
to
keep
that
process
up
until
something
were
done
that
was
satisfactory
to
the
new
haven,
the
trustees
and
the
appropriate
class
of
security
holders
or
that
the
penn-central
would
have
to
lease
the
new
haven
road
and
operate
it
on
a
lease
basis
and
even
that
would
assume
that
the
terms
of
the
lease
would
be
accepted
by
the
new
haven,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
who
would
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
who
would
be
at
whose
mercy?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
would
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they've
either
got
a
great
deal
of
power
or
not
quite
enough
power?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
but
the
concept
and
situation
of
this
sort
of
absolute
equality
of
bargaining
power,
sort
of
boggled
my
imagination.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcdermott,
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
i
clearly
understand
the
position
of
b
&
m
here.
are
you
asking
that
we
affirm
except
on
the
valuation
point?
justice
abe
fortas
except
for
valuation,
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
you're
asking
that
we
consider
valuation
at
this
time
and
that
we
remand
with
respect
to
the
valuation
point.
justice
abe
fortas
but
otherwise
that
we
affirm
the
order
below.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
the
only
opportunity
that
there
will
be
for
boston
and
maine
to
attack
the
exchange
ratio?
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
work?
why
do
we
have
to
pass
on
it
now?
justice
abe
fortas
this
has
not
been
accepted
by
boston
and
maine,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
they'd
submit
--
it
hasn't
been
submitted,
the
boston
and
maine?
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
--
won't
that
--
won't
there
be
a
proceeding,
subsequent
proceedings
when
it
is
submitted
to
boston
and
maine
and
isn't
that
the
time
when
the
exchange
ratio
will
be
right
for
judicial
consideration?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'd
wonder.
i'm
not
clear
on
this
from
--
apart
from
it.
but
i
wonder
if
these
exchange
ratios
are
right
for
our
consideration
at
this
time.
now,
i
can
understand
that
it
might
be
argued
that
since
exchange
ratios
have
not
been
finally,
conclusively
settled
for
all
the
time,
we
ought
not
to
permit
the
merger
to
go
into
effect.
that's
a
wonderful
line
of
argument.
but,
if
--
what
you
seemed
to
be
doing,
it's
argued
that
we
ought
to
review
the
exchange
ratio
at
this
time,
i
confess
i
have
some
problems
in
my
mind
because
the
exchange
ratios
are
not
final
in
the
sense
that
there
has
been
approval,
offer
and
acceptance,
and
administrative
approval.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
your
stockholders
agree
with
you
and
they
reject
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
under
such
a
situation
and
assuming
that
d
&
h
had
accepted
the
terms
proposed
for
them,
then
under
the
outstanding
orders
of
the
commission,
we
would
be
precluded
from
proceeding
in
penn-central
either
on
a
joint
application
with
penn-central
or
on
a
petition
filed
under
that
reserved
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
would
have
to
seek
our
home
elsewhere.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
not.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
your
position
entirely
either.
you
are
not
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
district
court's
order
of
permitting
the
merger
to
go
forward.
justice
abe
fortas
all
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
order
that
the
commission
have
a
hearing
on
your
--
the
grievance
that
you
communicated
to
us,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
has
a
proposal
been
made
to
the
bondholders?
has
a
proposal
been
made
which
bondholders
don't
like?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
the
proposal
in
terms
of
the
bondholders?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
it's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
too
complicated
for
us
to
consider?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
forgive
me
for
interrupting
your
argument.
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
opening
statement
which
you
said
that
nobody
opposes
the
merger
except
for
the
city
of
scranton
and
mr.
shapp.
is
that
true
of
the
b
&
o
and
n
&
w
who
are
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
but
it
is
quite
important.
i
got
the
impression
during
the
argument
that
the
position
of
the
b
&
o
and
the
n
&
w
was
that
the
merger
should
not
be
consummated
unless
the
inclusion
proceedings
were
first
consummated
and
consummated
in
a
way
that
they
consider
fair.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
really
does
amount
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
put
to
you
some
basic
propositions
here
related
to
the
colloquy
between
you
and
mr.
justice
white
and
let's
see
if
the
--
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
them.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
fundamental
problem
in
the
inclusion
prior
this
case
stems
from
the
conclusion
that
if
penn-central
merger
went
through
without
some
provision
being
made
or
viable
future
for
these
three
small
roads,
they
--
those
three
small
roads
would
be
injured
and
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
and
this
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
injury
to
the
public
interest
which
would
be
consequent
upon
that
eventuality
was
so
substantial
that
it
would
not
permit
the
merger
to
go
through
unless
something
were
done
about
it.
now,
are
you
--
are
we
together
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
far?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
point
one.
point
two,
the
question
which
we
now
have
before
us
it
seems
to
me
is
tentatively,
is
whether
the
net
of
that
reason
is
that
the
commission
had
to
provide
to
these
three
roads
a
fair
and
reasonable
alternative,
that
is
to
say,
whether
the
commission
had
to
offer
and
provide
for
the
offer
to
these
roads
of
a
specific
home
in
which
their
future
would
be
protected?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it's
not
of
--
now,
if
that
is
the
case
and
the
issue
before
us
is
not
whether
these
roads
will
or
will
not
accept
it
but
whether
the
commission
has
done
what
this
court
held
to
be
its
duty
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
commission
did
reserve
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
i
can't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
put
my
hands
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
can't
put
my
hands
on
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction
in
this
mass
of
papers
here
but
it
--
wasn't
there
a
general
reservation
of
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
net
of
it
is
that
norfolk
&
western
emerges
as
a
sole
--
would
emerge
as
the
sole
stockholder
of
erie
and
lackawanna?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
erie
and
lackawanna
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
remain
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
and
in
due
course,
erie
and
lackawanna
would
remain
as
corporate
entity
and
the
bondholders
of
erie
and
lackawanna
would
have
whatever
claim
they've
got.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
same
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
same
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i
missed
you.
is
that
true
even
though
d
&
h
has
not
--
doesn't
go
along?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
talking
about
is
true,
just
an
inclusion
limited
to
the
erie-lackawanna.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
the
earnings
of
erie
and
lackawanna
though
assuming
that
it
remained
as
a
separate
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
a
separate
entity?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
what
you're
saying
that
the
bondholders'
fear
of
a
hesitation
and
dilution
of
their
efforts
is
quite
farfetched.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
d
&
h-e
and
l
situation
comparable
to
appendix
g?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
fear
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
fear
of
the
bondholders
is
that
norfolk
&
western
as
emerging
as
a
sole
stockholder
of
e
&
l,
will
so
handle
the
fears
of
e
&
l
that
there
won't
be
any
interest
--
they
won't
pay
any
money
to
pay
their
--
the
interest
on
their
bonds.
justice
abe
fortas
theoretically,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
possibility.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
not
violating.
it
wouldn't
be
violating
contracts.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
have
a
question
as
to
whether
the
bondholders
have
a
remedy
against
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
your
remarks
here
is
making
a
concession
binding
on
norfolk
&
western.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
the
thrust
of
what
you're
telling
us
that
even
if
b
&
--
if
erie
and
lackawanna
were
the
only
one
included
in
the
d
&
h,
it
still
be
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
simplicity
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
you
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
all
these
on
the
assumption
of
--
assumption
that
we've
got
to
conclude
that
the
commission
did
not
err
in
saying
you
have
to
include
all
of
these
--
each
one
of
these
railroads
or
two
of
them
or
three
of
them?
are
you
assuming
that
the
commission
--
that
we
have
to
--
do
we
have
to
decide
or
do
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
commission
did
not
err
in
making
that
determination
or
if
we
--
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
should
say
that
it
was
error
for
the
commission
to
order
the
inclusion
of
these
roads,
one
of
them
or
two
of
them
if
they
didn't
know
--
go
on,
we
say
that
as
an
abstract
manner
that's
error.
then
you're
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
anyway
financially
so
far
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
erie
and
lackawanna
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
about
the
basis
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
alright,
let's
lay
the
teapot.
how
about
the
basic
proposition?
how
about
the
teapot?
you
--
are
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
commission
--
that
we
have
to
review
that
question
as
to
whether
if
only
one
of
these
roads
goes
along
with
this
and
not
all
three
of
them,
it
still
works
out
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
or
another
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
possibility,
i
mean
another
possibility
may
be
to
assume
that
all
the
commission
had
to
do
was
to
make
it
possible
for
any
one
of
these
three
roads
that
wanted
too
to
accept
a
fair
offer.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
if
that
is
correct,
do
we
have
to
go
any
further
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
out
whether
the
commission
made
sure
that
there
was
provision
opened
to
each
of
these
roads
for
inclusion
in
one
of
these
systems.
and
if
there
was
such
provision,
does
that
--
does
it
or
does
not
--
does
it
not
in
your
opinion
in
the
judicial
job?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
here
for
delaware
&
hudson?
justice
abe
fortas
and
mr.
dumaine
is
the
president
in
that,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
here
urging
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
below,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no
ifs,
ands,
and
buts
and
no
conditions,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
is
this
an
academic
exercise
or
an
indication
of
interest
in
the
public
welfare
or
do
we
assume
that
delaware
&
hudson,
in
spite
mr.
dumaine's
letter
wants
to
have
this
approval,
presumably,
so
that
it
can
be
appropriate
transactions
can
be
completed
and
the
matter
is
presented
to
the
stockholders
or
whatever
is
required
for
consummation,
is
that
a
fair
assumption?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
is
bound
by
what
you're
saying
today,
hasn't
he?
i
mean
i
don't
under
--
quite
understand
this.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
quite
understand
this.
you're
the
counsel
for
the
delaware
&
hudson.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
is
the
president
of
it.
so
i
assume
you're
speaking
for
him
in
that
capacity.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
that
explained
it.
i
got
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
cox,
do
we
have
to
pass
on
that
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
will
you
explain
that?
justice
abe
fortas
does
--
do
they
make
any
point
in
which
in
your
judgment
of
the
bondholders
of
the
new
haven
make
any
point
which
in
your
judgment
does
not
fall
within
that
category?
and
if
so
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
its
not
harsh
unless
(inaudible)
--
harsh,
mr.
cox,
unless
you
attack
different
significance
to
the
words
that
they
have
a
right
to
remain
independent
and
i
would
do
it,
that
is
--
they
have
a
right
to
remain
independent
if
they
can
cut
the
mustard,
i
think,
and
manage
to
do
it
as
an
economic
matter,
but
nothing
else
and
what
the
government
as
i
understand
the
theory,
doesn't
have
the
right,
doesn't
have
the
duty
to
assure
that
they
can
stay
in
existence
to
make
money.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
wants
us
to
affirm.
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
they
do
that?
perhaps
i
missed
you.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
they
decided.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
--
now
wait,
how
do
they
go
beyond
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
we're
ought
to
declare
appendix
g
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
we
did
that
then
that
would
force
these
roads
into
the
bosom
of
the
n
&
w,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
in
that
way,
you
want
them
to
get
rather
appendix
g
--
n
&
w
is
not
a
party
to
appendix
g.
it's
affected
by
them.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
--
you're
affected
by
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
appendix
g
ought
to
be
eliminated
and
that
means
that
these
roads
would
be
a
subject
of
the
siphoning
of
and
diversion
of
traffic
and
then
it
have
to
go
looking
for
somewhere
else
so
they
can
get
something
to
eat,
isn't
that
right?
