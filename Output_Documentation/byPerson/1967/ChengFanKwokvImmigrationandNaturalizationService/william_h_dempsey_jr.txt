mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
the
outset
just
to
take
a
few
moments
to
sketch
very
general
terms
the
character
of
the
argument
that
i
make
on
behalf
of
the
--
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
if
ruled,
i
come
to
rest
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
realize
that
it's
not
usual
for
a
case
in
this
court
involving
a
question
of
statutory
construction
to
be
decided
simply
by
reference
to
the
statutory
language,
their
constitutional
problems
generally
or
important
conflicting
policy
considerations
or
the
legislative
history
looks
sharply
in
a
direction
different
from
the
statute
seems
to
indicate
and
i'm
particularly
hesitant
to
suggest
that
this
is
not
such
a
case
because
it
is
here
after
all
because
of
a
rather
widespread
conflict
in
the
lower
courts
and
yet
that
is
my
view
of
the
matter.
i
should
hope
to
show
that
the
statutory
language
strongly
supports
the
judgement
of
the
third
circuit
and
not
only
that
but
that
there
are
no
significant
countervailing
considerations.
no
relevant
factors
that
should
lead
one
to
look
beyond
the
evident
meaning
of
the
statutory
terms.
certainly,
there
are
no
constitutional
overtones
to
this
case.
this
is
a
case
of
a
very
narrow
and
i
think
quite
technical
statutory
construction
issue
and
i
should
hope
also
to
show,
however,
that
there
is
no
significant
legislative
history
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
arguments
made
by
petitioner
and
respondent,
and
that
the
affirmance
of
the
judgement
of
the
third
circuit
would
not
result
in
consequences,
so
undesirable
that
one
should
wonder
whether
the
congress
really
intended
them.
and
also,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
should
say
and
i
hope
to
get
to
it
in
some
detail
that
we
do
rely
upon
foti.
evidently,
everyone
relies
upon
foti
and
then
we're
not
concerned
by
giova.
now,
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
as
the
court
is
aware,
it
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
directly
final
orders
of
deportation
made
pursuant
to
aministrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
the
act.
i
should
think
that
--
and
i
gather
that
mr.
gordon
would
agree
with
me
from
what
he
said
this
morning
that
if
the
statute
read,
orders
made
in
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
the
act,
the
case
would
not
be
here.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
order
was
not
entered
in
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
but
the
government
urges
that
the
term
pursuant
is
different
than
--
the
phrase
'pursuant
to'
is
different
in
the
word
'in'
and
that
by
using
that
phrase
in
place
of
the
word
'in',
the
congress
meant
to
convey
the
intention
that
any
order
entered
in
or
outside
of
the
242
(b)
proceeding
shall
be
directly
reviewable
as
long
as
it
has
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
final
order
of
deportation.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
my
interpretation
in
the
statute,
no
mr.
justice
white.
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
only.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
correct,
under
my
view,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
about
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
case
of
petitions
to
reopen
242
(b)
proceedings
which
go
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
i
make
that
exception
so
i
overstated
my
or
understated
my
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it
must
be,
however,
in
order
that
is
either
made
in
the
initial
242
(b)
proceeding
or
under
giova
in
a
motion
to
reopen
that
proceeding.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
i
would.
i
don't
know
that
that
could
ever
be
litigated
with
the
issue
to
stay.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
it's
the
--
well,
it's
the
person
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
person
who
functions
within
the
procedures
prescribed
by
section
242
(b)
but
i
don't
agree
with
the
government
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
question
as
to
whether
an
officer
labeled
the
district
director
or
a
special
inquiry
officer
or
a
group
labeled
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
i
think,
what
matters
is
that
the
order
is
or
isn't
entered
in
the
procedures
that
are
established
by
the
statute,
the
statute
being
such
in
242
(b).
and
i
think
there's
a
reason
for
that,
at
least
a
reason
that
can
possibly
be
assigned
to
the
congress
and
let
me
turn
to
that
reason
immediately.
i
should
say
before
i
leave
the
statutory
language
that
the
government
suggests
something
else
and
that
is
that
the
phrase
'pursuant
to'
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
was
designed
to
ensure
that
this
statute
would
not
be
applied
to
orders
entered
in
exclusion
proceedings.
i
just
think
that
stretching
the
statute
very
much
indeed
and
i
think
that
if
the
congress
intended
that
they
pick
the
most
unusual
and
misleading
way
of
saying
it
but
i
don't
think
they
did
because
in
subsection
b
of
the
act,
they
said
it
expressly.
they
said,
“this
procedure
shall
not
apply
to
exclusion
cases.”
that
is
they
said,
“exclusion
cases
will
be
reviewable
only
in
habeas
corpus.”
now,
if
i'm
right
about
that,
if
the
statutory
language
thus
strongly
support
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit,
then
the
question
is,
“is
there
some
reason
to
go
behind
the
evident
meaning
of
the
statute?”
and
i
will
assume
arguendo
now
that
there
is
some
play
in
the
statutory
language
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
think
that
assumption
is
entitled
to
be
viewed
with
the
good
deal
of
skepticism.
i
think
that
this
language
is
quite
clear
enough
so
that
this
court
could
appropriately
stop
the
inquiry
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
say
that
whatever
might
be
said
about
policy
or
about
legislative
history
that
the
job
of
the
congress
is
to
remodel
the
statute
if
for
some
reason,
they
intended
what
they
did
not
say
in
section
106
(a).
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
some
give
here
and
some
room
for
construction,
let
me
deal
with
the
other
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
in
logic
perhaps,
i
should
move
to
legislative
history
but
the
reason
that
is
not
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
and
in
any
event,
i
think
what
i
have
to
say
about
that
might
be
more
meaningful
in
the
context
of
things
that
i
have
to
say
about
some
of
the
other
arguments.
i
think
to
me
at
least
and
perhaps
the
most
persuasive
argument
advanced
by
the
government
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
or
the
construction
given
the
statute
by
the
third
circuit
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
reasonable
to
differentiate
between
two
different
kinds
of
orders
which
in
substance
are
about
the
same
simply
on
the
ground
that
one
has
entered
in
a
242
(b)
proceeding
and
the
other
isn't.
and
if
that's
true,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
then
one
should
be
reluctant
to
ascribe
that
kind
of
nonsensical
purpose
to
the
congress.
my
response
to
that
of
course
is
that
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
congress
intended
to
make
precisely
this
differentiation
on
the
ground
that
one
order
is
entered
in
the
242
(b)
proceeding
and
that
the
other
is
not,
even
though
as
mr.
gordon
correctly
points
out
in
their
effect
on
the
deportation
order,
the
orders
may
be
precisely
the
same
or
substantially
the
same.
now
here,
it's
time
i
think
to
look
at
what
section
242
(b)
is
with
some
precision.
section
242
(b)
is
a
very
important
section
of
the
statute.
it
provides
what
i
think
can
fairly
be
called
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding.
in
detail,
it
guarantees
the
alien
the
right
to
be
advised
of
the
charges
against
him,
the
right
to
inadequate
notice
of
the
time
of
the
place
of
the
hearing.
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
the
right
to
have
the
determination
made
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
in
the
hearing
and
most
importantly,
not
only
the
right
to
introduce
whatever
testimony
and
documentary
evidence
the
alien
wishes
to
put
in
himself
and
not
merely
the
right
to
be
advised
of
the
evidence
against
him
but
the
right
to
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
now,
this
is
truly
a
trial
type
quasi-judicial
proceeding
that
the
statute
establishes.
the
question
then
it
seems
to
me
is,
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
the
congress
intended
that
there
would
be
direct
review
only
of
orders
entered
in
this
type
of
quasi
judicial
proceeding.
and
i
suggest
here,
that
my
burden
is
not
quite
as
heavy
on
this
point
as
the
government
would
like
me
to
assume.
i
don't
think
that
if
i'm
right
about
the
force
of
the
statutory
language,
i
don't
think
that
i
should
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
congress
acted
reasonably
in
distinguishing
this
way.
i
think
all
that
i
have
to
show
is
that
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
they
intended
to.
and
i'd
like
to
indicate
what
i
mean
in
a
little
more
detail
but
first,
let
me
indicate
why
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
they
may
have
intended
to.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
discover
and
neither
petitioner
nor
respondent
have
been
able
to
come
up
with
anything
different,
every
other
direct
review
statute
that
the
congress
has
passed
is
geared
to
orders
that
are
entered
in
the
context
of
quasi-judicial
hearings,
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
the
prototype
statute
here
is
the
federal
trade
commission
act
of
1914
and
of
course
that
was
followed
by
a
series
of
different
statutory
provisions
relating
to
the
other
independent
regulatory
agencies,
and
of
course
they
all
operate
on
a
quasi-judicial
basis.
and
beyond
that,
there
are
a
handful
of
statutes
providing
for
direct
review
from
the
actions
of
other
administrative
officials
in
the
executive
branch.
there
--
some
of
them
were
quite
obscure.
we're
talking
about
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
in
setting
toll
rates
on
toll
bridges
that
sort
of
thing.
but
here
to
in
every
case
that
we've
been
able
to
discover,
the
statute
that
governs
the
entry
of
that
kind
of
order,
taking
of
that
kind
of
action
requires
a
quasi-judicial
type
of
proceeding.
now,
apart
from
another
reason
for
this
is
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
and
it
was
well
stated
by
chief
judge
bazelon
in
an
opinion
by
the
--
this
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
case
involving
an
appeal
from
an
attempted
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
it
was
not
one
of
those
that
had
to
be
entered
in
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
and
so
there
wasn't
a
trial
type
record.
the
court
declined
jurisdiction,
held
that
the
direct
review
statute
did
not
apply
and
stated
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
inadequate
record
was
simply
not
there
for
purposes
of
appellate
review
and
remanded
the
case
in
effect
to
the
district
court.
now,
as
i
say,
we
may
have
missed
the
statute.
this
is
an
area
that
goodness
knows
there
may
be
a
statute
working
around
here
providing
for
direct
review
of
an
order
that
doesn't
have
to
be
entered
in
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
but
if
we
missed
it
so
as
everybody
else
and
i
am
confident
at
least
that
we
have
sufficiently
covered
the
areas
so
that
we
can
say
that
the
pattern
is
clear,
the
pattern
of
legislation
prior
to
106
(a)
in
other
areas.
the
orders
that
are
directly
reviewable
are
orders
by
and
large
if
not
entirely
that
must
be
made
in
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
now,
if
that
so,
i
think
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
entirely
plausible
to
say
or
to
think
that
in
acting
106
(a)
and
providing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
only
orders
entered
in
a
section
242
(b)
proceeding
shall
be
directly
appealable,
that
congress
was
simply
carrying
over
into
another
area
a
pattern
that
had
been
established
in
the
past
in
all
other
areas.
now,
perhaps
if
they
thought
about
it,
they
would
have
concluded
that
it
wasn't
a
good
thing
to
have
it
in
these
areas
the
government
suggests.
perhaps
they
might
even
think
that
it
probably
wasn't
a
very
good
idea
to
have
this
kind
of
limitation
with
respect
to
others.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
of
course
they
didn't
think
about
it.
there
isn't
any
indication
at
all
that
they
consider
this
problem.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
since
the
question
is
simply
one
of
statutory
construction
that
when
the
statute
seems
clear
enough
on
it's
face
and
when
there
is
good
reason
to
think
that
the
congress
intended
what
it
seemed
to
have
said
that
that
ought
rightly
to
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
i
appreciate
of
course
that
to
the
extent,
i
can
meet
the
government's
contention
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
congress
had
acted
differently
and
i
probably
strengthen
my
position
and
this
is
a
more
difficult
area
unquestionably
but
let
me
deal
with
it
briefly.
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
primarily
in
it's
supplemental
brief
in
response
to
the
argument
that
i've
just
made,
the
government
says
in
effect,
“well,
there
isn't
any
purpose
in
the
immigration
and
the
judicial
review
of
immigration
orders'
area
to
require
that
there
would
be
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
as
the
base
for
the
direct
review
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i'm
not
entirely
clear
in
my
own
mind
whether
one
of
the
things
the
government
is
saying
is
that
in
this
area,
perhaps
as
distinguished
from
other
areas,
there
is
never
or
hardly
ever
any
case
that
goes
to
the
court
in
which
there
is
not
a
material
issue
of
disputed
fact
as
to
which
the
administrative
record
is
inadequate
if
it's
outside
of
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
if
they
are
saying
that,
i
do
not
agree.
i
think
that
is
not
demonstrable.
in
fact,
i
think
it
can
be
demonstrated
and
not
to
be
corrected.
i
do
think
that
if
all
they
mean
to
say
is
that
by
and
large,
the
judicial
review
of
ins
orders,
turn
on
legal
questions
that
don't
involve
material
issues
of
disputed
fact
and
the
records
are
by
and
large
adequate,
i
think
that
is
almost
surely
true.
i
think
that's
almost
surely
true
of
any
review
of
administrative
agencies.
by
and
large,
the
administrative
agencies
do
make
adequate
records
whether
or
not
the
statute
requires
it.
but
the
cases
that
the
government
cites,
established
that
this
is
not
always
so.
in
the
tahiti
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
case
that's
cited
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
their
supplemental
brief.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
courts
of
appeals
found
inadequacies
in
the
record.
inadeqacies
that
had
to
be
patched
up
before
those
courts
felt
that
they
could
adequately
review
the
case.
they
felt
there
could
not
be
inform
judicial
review.
we've
cited
another
case
in
our
brief.
i
just
try
another
ninth
circuit
across
another
ninth
circuit
case
of
the
same
court
kind
of
this
morning.
i
think
what
the
government
says
over
in
response
to
that
is
that
well,
perhaps
so,
there
might
be
cases
in
which
if
you
didn't
have
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
required
by
statute
and
left
the
agency
to
it's
own
devices,
there
might
be
inadequacies
in
the
records
and
in
some
cases
of
judicial
review
but
still,
the
district
court
would
have
no
unique
function
to
perform.
it
might
as
well
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
of
course,
we're
talking
about
the
evidentiary
function
of
a
trial
court.
the
reason
that
that's
true,
the
government
says
is
that
in
such
a
case,
the
court
would
not
be
entitled
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
that
is
the
district
court.
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
agency
for
a
hearing,
for
a
further
hearing,
for
an
expanded
hearing.
now,
this
may
be
a
perfectly
sensible
approach
to
this
kind
of
problem
and
i
suspect
it
is,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
the
government
has
indicated
in
it's
brief,
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
a
federal
court
to
require
the
agency
to
hold
a
hearing
except
under
section
242
(b)
so
that
if
these
actions
are
taken
outside
of
242
(b)
and
putting
aside
of
course
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
requirement
in
some
cases,
i
see
no
basis
for
the
suggestion
that
a
federal
court
could
require
the
agency
to
patch
up
a
record
that
needed
patching.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
remanding
to
the
agency.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes.
well,
as
i
say,
it
is
possible
that
there's
some
way
that
this
kind
of
a
result
could
be
justified
and
as
i
say,
i
suspect
that
it's
probably
quite
a
reasonable
thing
to
do
but
in
this
area
in
the
bufalino
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
this
was
a
case
in
which
when
the
kind
of
action
that
the
ins
took
in
denying
discretionary
relief,
when
that
action
was
taken
under
the
regulations,
that
action
could
not
be
taken
under
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
declined
to
take
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
not
to
the
agency
but
to
the
district
court
for
the
taking
of
evidence.
so
that
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
cases
in
this
area
in
which
if
a
242
(b)
proceeding
is
not
held,
the
record
will
be
inadequate
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
district
court
may
well
have
a
unique
function
to
perform
in
building
inadequate
record
for
judicial
review.
and
in
those
circumstances,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
congress
to
act
as
it
did
in
differentiating
between
orders
entered
in
a
242
(b)
proceeding
and
orders
entered
outside
the
242
(b)
proceeding.
now,
the
government
suggest
that
there
will
be
practical
problems
that
will
arise
if
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed
and
they
speak
in
the
name
of
what
they
call
bifurcation
which
i
take
it
means
that
for
a
particular
alien
who
is
contesting
two
or
three
orders,
some
of
which
are
entered
in
the
242
(b)
proceeding
and
some
of
which
are
entered
by
the
district
director,
he
would
wind
up
in
two
different
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
i
don't
really
think
that
this
is
so
because
i
take
it
that
the
government
does
not
retreat
from
the
position
in
this
respect
that
it
took
in
foti
and
that
is
that
where
a
petition
for
review
is
properly
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
another
order
is
entered
by
a
district
court
outside
242
(b),
i
suggest
and
as
i
say,
i
think
the
government
agrees
that
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
is
applicable
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
discretion
to
be
sure
but
in
its
discretion
would
have
jurisdiction
over
both
issues.
i
see
that
this
is
an
issue
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
reach
in
foti
but
i
see
no
problem
with
it
so
far
as
traditional
backgrounds
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
are
concerned.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
still
and
all,
i
don't
know
that
the
problem
is
too
terribly
serious
and
certainly,
it
would
not
seem
to
me
to
involve
any
problems,
any
particular
problems
for
the
judiciary.
i
would
think
that
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
hold
the
petition
for
review
until
the
district
court
have
disposed
of
the
issues
before
it
and
then
if
the
district
court
action
didn't
move
the
case,
an
appeal
were
taken,
the
two
proceedings
at
that
point
would
be
consolidated.
now,
to
be
sure,
this
means
that
there
will
not
be
in
such
a
situation
the
kind
of
expedition
that
the
government
wants
and
this,
i
suppose,
brings
me
to
their
argument
taken
to
legislative
history.
the
government
rests
very
heavily
upon
the
legislative
history
that
demonstrates
and
it
certainly
does
demonstrate
that
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
section
106
not
just
this
provision
but
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
was
to
expedite
judicial
review
in
deportation
cases.
and
i
think
about
all
that
i
can
say
about
that
is
that
this
kind
of
a
evidence
of
a
general
legislative
purpose
cannot
survive
the
kind
of
statute
that
there
is
here
which
reflects,
i
suggest,
quite
clearly
a
limiting
subsidiary
purpose
to
confine
direct
review
to
cases
that
involve
orders
that
are
entered
in
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
such
a
limiting
purpose.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
congress
intended
that
there
would
be
expedition
at
all
costs.
so
far
as
particular
legislative
history
bearing
upon
this
single
provision
is
concerned,
there
are
not
very
much.
the
government
relies
upon
--
primarily
upon
a
chart
which
is
appended
to
its
brief
at
page
55,
the
last
page
that
chart
in
term
was
appended
to
two
house
committee
reports.
i
must
confess
that
i've
had
real
difficulty
in
understanding
the
relevance
of
this
chart
to
the
particular
issue
involved
in
this
case.
as
i
look
at
that
chart,
all
that
it
means
to
me
and
all
that
i
suggest
any
as
what
have
said
about
it
in
the
house
reports
is
that
for
the
information
of
the
members
of
the
committee
and
the
information
of
the
members
of
the
congress,
the
committee
outlined
in
block
and
line
form,
everything
that
could
happen
once
a
deportable
alien
was
found
in
the
united
states
including
private
legislation
for
example.
private
legislation
falls
in
the
same
box
in
which
we
find
stay
of
deportation
and
the
line
goes
over
the
final
order
of
deportation
too.
well,
obviously
the
committee
didn't
mean
that
there
would
be
any
judicial
review
of
private
legislation
under
section
106
(a).
there
is
nothing
here,
i
suggest,
that
says
that
this
chart
was
meant
to
outline
the
various
kinds
of
procedural
steps
that
would
fall
within
section
106
(a),
and
that's
the
issue
here.
now,
for
our
part,
we
rely
upon
an
interchange
during
the
house
debates
on
this
legislation
between
congressman
libonati
and
congressman
walter.
congressman
walter
of
course
was
the
author
of
the
bill.
he
was
the
manager
of
the
bill
on
the
house
floor.
congressman
libonati
opposed
the
bill.
the
government
says
that
representative
libonati's
question
was
uninformed.
we
would
rather
characterize
it
as
penetrating.
and
they
say
that
representative
walter's
reply
was
cursory
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
was
very
discerning.
but
i
guess
the
words
will
have
to
speak
for
themselves.
but
what
happened
and
what
the
words
are
is
this.
representative
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
pages
32
and
33
of
my
brief.
representative
libonati
said
this,
“we
know
that
under
such
a
situation
that
is
under
direct
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
inquire
as
to
anything
beyond
the
written
record.
we
know
further
that
no
written
record
would
be
supplied
to
the
petitioner
in
the
proceeding.
it
would
merely
be
a
systematic
method
of
disposing
of
the
case
of
the
earliest
opportunity
without
any
question
as
to
the
relevant
facts
that
might
be
brought
into
the
case
by
the
petitioner
in
a
district
court
hearing
by
federal
district
judge.”
and
in
reply,
mr.
walter
said,
“i
respectfully
invite
the
gentleman's
attention
to
the
law
in
section
242
in
which
the
procedure
for
the
examiner
set
forth
in
detail.
the
gentleman
apparently
has
not
seen
this
section.”
now,
of
course,
representative
walter
might
not
have
been
thinking
fast
at
that
point
or
he
might
have
been
conceivably
just
trying
to
score
debaters
points
but
if
one
credits
what
he
says
as
it
seems
to
me
one
should.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
kind
of
things
that
i've
been
talking
about
this
morning,
the
possible
inadequacy
of
the
record
when
a
case
goes
from
an
order
entered
by
district
director
for
the
court
of
appeals.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
because
section
242
takes
care
of
it.
it
will
give
the
appellate
courts
inadequate
record
and
of
course
it
will
if
the
right
to
review
is
confined
to
orders
entered
in
the
context
of
section
242
(b)
proceedings.
now,
as
to
foti,
of
course
the
case
is
open
for
consideration
and
what
was
said
in
foti
can
be
modified.
but
i
should
think
there
isn't
any
serious
question
that
if
the
language
of
the
foti
opinion
is
applied
faithfully
to
this
case,
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
will
be
affirmed.
in
footnote
16
in
the
foti
case,
this
court
addressed
itself
specifically
to
the
problem
here.
the
problem
whether
an
order
in
that
particular
footnote
was
an
order
withholding
deportation.
whether
an
order
entered
outside
section
242
(b)
proceeding
would
fall
within
section
106
(a)
and
this
court
said
that
presumably,
it
would
not.
now,
this
is
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
upon
which
the
third
circuit
rely
and
certainly
at
the
very
least,
it
can
be
said
that
they
did
try
to
apply
without
qualification
the
most
recent
and
the
most
relevant
statement
by
this
court.
in
addition
to
that
in
the
text
of
the
foti
opinion,
the
court
repeatedly
stressed
the
consideration
that
he
order
involved
there
had
been
entered
in
a
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
if
the
government
is
right
today,
all
of
that
was
irrelevant
so
that
--
and
while
we
concede
that
the
holding
in
foti
is
not
governing
here
but
if
the
theory
of
the
government
is
accepted
here,
a
good
deal
of
what
was
said
in
foti
will
have
to
be
qualified
very
sharply.
and
i
suggest
that
in
an
area
and
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
has
generated
such
in
my
judgement
a
remarkable
amount
of
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
that
all
things
else
being
reasonably
equal,
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
as
consistent
of
pattern
of
rationale
in
this
court's
opinion
as
possible.
so
far
as
giova
is
concerned,
i
distinguish
giova
if
that's
the
proper
term
on
the
same
basis
that
the
solicitor
general
urged
upon
the
court
in
giova
itself.
the
solicitor
general
said
was
that
while
at
that
time
he
thought
that
orders
of
the
kind
we
have
involved
in
this
case
would
not
fall
within
106
(a)
because
it
entered
wholly
outside
the
242
(b)
proceedings.
at
the
same
time,
he
thought
that
--
well,
he
thought
giova
was
a
close
case.
at
the
same
time,
he
thought
that
it
was
appropriate
to
have
motions
to
reopen
a
242
proceeding
to
follow
the
same
path
through
the
courts
as
the
orders
entered
into
the
242
(b)
proceeding
itself
by
analogy
to
petitions
for
rehearing
in
courts
are
motions
for
new
trial,
things
of
that
sort
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
sensible.
that
concludes
i
think
the
major
things
i
would
have
to
say.
i
would
like
to
add
if
it's
appropriate
but
that
i
was
greatly
aided
in
this
case
by
the
particularly
having
no
particular
experience
in
this
area
by
the
open
and
fully
candid
and
very
helpful
cooperation
of
mr.
gordon
and
also
mr.
beytagh
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
i
appreciate
it
in
a
great
deal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
it's
a
great
pleasure
for
me.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
the
outset
just
to
take
a
few
moments
to
sketch
very
general
terms
the
character
of
the
argument
that
i
make
on
behalf
of
the
--
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
if
ruled,
i
come
to
rest
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
realize
that
it's
not
usual
for
a
case
in
this
court
involving
a
question
of
statutory
construction
to
be
decided
simply
by
reference
to
the
statutory
language,
their
constitutional
problems
generally
or
important
conflicting
policy
considerations
or
the
legislative
history
looks
sharply
in
a
direction
different
from
the
statute
seems
to
indicate
and
i'm
particularly
hesitant
to
suggest
that
this
is
not
such
a
case
because
it
is
here
after
all
because
of
a
rather
widespread
conflict
in
the
lower
courts
and
yet
that
is
my
view
of
the
matter.
i
should
hope
to
show
that
the
statutory
language
strongly
supports
the
judgement
of
the
third
circuit
and
not
only
that
but
that
there
are
no
significant
countervailing
considerations.
no
relevant
factors
that
should
lead
one
to
look
beyond
the
evident
meaning
of
the
statutory
terms.
certainly,
there
are
no
constitutional
overtones
to
this
case.
this
is
a
case
of
a
very
narrow
and
i
think
quite
technical
statutory
construction
issue
and
i
should
hope
also
to
show,
however,
that
there
is
no
significant
legislative
history
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
arguments
made
by
petitioner
and
respondent,
and
that
the
affirmance
of
the
judgement
of
the
third
circuit
would
not
result
in
consequences,
so
undesirable
that
one
should
wonder
whether
the
congress
really
intended
them.
and
also,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
should
say
and
i
hope
to
get
to
it
in
some
detail
that
we
do
rely
upon
foti.
evidently,
everyone
relies
upon
foti
and
then
we're
not
concerned
by
giova.
now,
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
as
the
court
is
aware,
it
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
directly
final
orders
of
deportation
made
pursuant
to
aministrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
the
act.
i
should
think
that
--
and
i
gather
that
mr.
gordon
would
agree
with
me
from
what
he
said
this
morning
that
if
the
statute
read,
orders
made
in
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
the
act,
the
case
would
not
be
here.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
order
was
not
entered
in
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
but
the
government
urges
that
the
term
pursuant
is
different
than
--
the
phrase
'pursuant
to'
is
different
in
the
word
'in'
and
that
by
using
that
phrase
in
place
of
the
word
'in',
the
congress
meant
to
convey
the
intention
that
any
order
entered
in
or
outside
of
the
242
(b)
proceeding
shall
be
directly
reviewable
as
long
as
it
has
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
final
order
of
deportation.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
my
interpretation
in
the
statute,
no
mr.
justice
white.
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
only.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
correct,
under
my
view,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
about
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
case
of
petitions
to
reopen
242
(b)
proceedings
which
go
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
i
make
that
exception
so
i
overstated
my
or
understated
my
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it
must
be,
however,
in
order
that
is
either
made
in
the
initial
242
(b)
proceeding
or
under
giova
in
a
motion
to
reopen
that
proceeding.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
i
would.
i
don't
know
that
that
could
ever
be
litigated
with
the
issue
to
stay.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
it's
the
--
well,
it's
the
person
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
person
who
functions
within
the
procedures
prescribed
by
section
242
(b)
but
i
don't
agree
with
the
government
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
question
as
to
whether
an
officer
labeled
the
district
director
or
a
special
inquiry
officer
or
a
group
labeled
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
i
think,
what
matters
is
that
the
order
is
or
isn't
entered
in
the
procedures
that
are
established
by
the
statute,
the
statute
being
such
in
242
(b).
and
i
think
there's
a
reason
for
that,
at
least
a
reason
that
can
possibly
be
assigned
to
the
congress
and
let
me
turn
to
that
reason
immediately.
i
should
say
before
i
leave
the
statutory
language
that
the
government
suggests
something
else
and
that
is
that
the
phrase
'pursuant
to'
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
was
designed
to
ensure
that
this
statute
would
not
be
applied
to
orders
entered
in
exclusion
proceedings.
i
just
think
that
stretching
the
statute
very
much
indeed
and
i
think
that
if
the
congress
intended
that
they
pick
the
most
unusual
and
misleading
way
of
saying
it
but
i
don't
think
they
did
because
in
subsection
b
of
the
act,
they
said
it
expressly.
they
said,
“this
procedure
shall
not
apply
to
exclusion
cases.”
that
is
they
said,
“exclusion
cases
will
be
reviewable
only
in
habeas
corpus.”
now,
if
i'm
right
about
that,
if
the
statutory
language
thus
strongly
support
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit,
then
the
question
is,
“is
there
some
reason
to
go
behind
the
evident
meaning
of
the
statute?”
and
i
will
assume
arguendo
now
that
there
is
some
play
in
the
statutory
language
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
think
that
assumption
is
entitled
to
be
viewed
with
the
good
deal
of
skepticism.
i
think
that
this
language
is
quite
clear
enough
so
that
this
court
could
appropriately
stop
the
inquiry
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
say
that
whatever
might
be
said
about
policy
or
about
legislative
history
that
the
job
of
the
congress
is
to
remodel
the
statute
if
for
some
reason,
they
intended
what
they
did
not
say
in
section
106
(a).
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
some
give
here
and
some
room
for
construction,
let
me
deal
with
the
other
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
in
logic
perhaps,
i
should
move
to
legislative
history
but
the
reason
that
is
not
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
and
in
any
event,
i
think
what
i
have
to
say
about
that
might
be
more
meaningful
in
the
context
of
things
that
i
have
to
say
about
some
of
the
other
arguments.
i
think
to
me
at
least
and
perhaps
the
most
persuasive
argument
advanced
by
the
government
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
or
the
construction
given
the
statute
by
the
third
circuit
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
reasonable
to
differentiate
between
two
different
kinds
of
orders
which
in
substance
are
about
the
same
simply
on
the
ground
that
one
has
entered
in
a
242
(b)
proceeding
and
the
other
isn't.
and
if
that's
true,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
then
one
should
be
reluctant
to
ascribe
that
kind
of
nonsensical
purpose
to
the
congress.
my
response
to
that
of
course
is
that
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
congress
intended
to
make
precisely
this
differentiation
on
the
ground
that
one
order
is
entered
in
the
242
(b)
proceeding
and
that
the
other
is
not,
even
though
as
mr.
gordon
correctly
points
out
in
their
effect
on
the
deportation
order,
the
orders
may
be
precisely
the
same
or
substantially
the
same.
now
here,
it's
time
i
think
to
look
at
what
section
242
(b)
is
with
some
precision.
section
242
(b)
is
a
very
important
section
of
the
statute.
it
provides
what
i
think
can
fairly
be
called
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding.
in
detail,
it
guarantees
the
alien
the
right
to
be
advised
of
the
charges
against
him,
the
right
to
inadequate
notice
of
the
time
of
the
place
of
the
hearing.
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
the
right
to
have
the
determination
made
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
in
the
hearing
and
most
importantly,
not
only
the
right
to
introduce
whatever
testimony
and
documentary
evidence
the
alien
wishes
to
put
in
himself
and
not
merely
the
right
to
be
advised
of
the
evidence
against
him
but
the
right
to
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
now,
this
is
truly
a
trial
type
quasi-judicial
proceeding
that
the
statute
establishes.
the
question
then
it
seems
to
me
is,
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
the
congress
intended
that
there
would
be
direct
review
only
of
orders
entered
in
this
type
of
quasi
judicial
proceeding.
and
i
suggest
here,
that
my
burden
is
not
quite
as
heavy
on
this
point
as
the
government
would
like
me
to
assume.
i
don't
think
that
if
i'm
right
about
the
force
of
the
statutory
language,
i
don't
think
that
i
should
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
congress
acted
reasonably
in
distinguishing
this
way.
i
think
all
that
i
have
to
show
is
that
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
they
intended
to.
and
i'd
like
to
indicate
what
i
mean
in
a
little
more
detail
but
first,
let
me
indicate
why
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
they
may
have
intended
to.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
discover
and
neither
petitioner
nor
respondent
have
been
able
to
come
up
with
anything
different,
every
other
direct
review
statute
that
the
congress
has
passed
is
geared
to
orders
that
are
entered
in
the
context
of
quasi-judicial
hearings,
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
the
prototype
statute
here
is
the
federal
trade
commission
act
of
1914
and
of
course
that
was
followed
by
a
series
of
different
statutory
provisions
relating
to
the
other
independent
regulatory
agencies,
and
of
course
they
all
operate
on
a
quasi-judicial
basis.
and
beyond
that,
there
are
a
handful
of
statutes
providing
for
direct
review
from
the
actions
of
other
administrative
officials
in
the
executive
branch.
there
--
some
of
them
were
quite
obscure.
we're
talking
about
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
in
setting
toll
rates
on
toll
bridges
that
sort
of
thing.
but
here
to
in
every
case
that
we've
been
able
to
discover,
the
statute
that
governs
the
entry
of
that
kind
of
order,
taking
of
that
kind
of
action
requires
a
quasi-judicial
type
of
proceeding.
now,
apart
from
another
reason
for
this
is
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
and
it
was
well
stated
by
chief
judge
bazelon
in
an
opinion
by
the
--
this
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
case
involving
an
appeal
from
an
attempted
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
it
was
not
one
of
those
that
had
to
be
entered
in
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
and
so
there
wasn't
a
trial
type
record.
the
court
declined
jurisdiction,
held
that
the
direct
review
statute
did
not
apply
and
stated
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
inadequate
record
was
simply
not
there
for
purposes
of
appellate
review
and
remanded
the
case
in
effect
to
the
district
court.
now,
as
i
say,
we
may
have
missed
the
statute.
this
is
an
area
that
goodness
knows
there
may
be
a
statute
working
around
here
providing
for
direct
review
of
an
order
that
doesn't
have
to
be
entered
in
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
but
if
we
missed
it
so
as
everybody
else
and
i
am
confident
at
least
that
we
have
sufficiently
covered
the
areas
so
that
we
can
say
that
the
pattern
is
clear,
the
pattern
of
legislation
prior
to
106
(a)
in
other
areas.
the
orders
that
are
directly
reviewable
are
orders
by
and
large
if
not
entirely
that
must
be
made
in
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
now,
if
that
so,
i
think
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
entirely
plausible
to
say
or
to
think
that
in
acting
106
(a)
and
providing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
only
orders
entered
in
a
section
242
(b)
proceeding
shall
be
directly
appealable,
that
congress
was
simply
carrying
over
into
another
area
a
pattern
that
had
been
established
in
the
past
in
all
other
areas.
now,
perhaps
if
they
thought
about
it,
they
would
have
concluded
that
it
wasn't
a
good
thing
to
have
it
in
these
areas
the
government
suggests.
perhaps
they
might
even
think
that
it
probably
wasn't
a
very
good
idea
to
have
this
kind
of
limitation
with
respect
to
others.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
of
course
they
didn't
think
about
it.
there
isn't
any
indication
at
all
that
they
consider
this
problem.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
since
the
question
is
simply
one
of
statutory
construction
that
when
the
statute
seems
clear
enough
on
it's
face
and
when
there
is
good
reason
to
think
that
the
congress
intended
what
it
seemed
to
have
said
that
that
ought
rightly
to
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
i
appreciate
of
course
that
to
the
extent,
i
can
meet
the
government's
contention
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
congress
had
acted
differently
and
i
probably
strengthen
my
position
and
this
is
a
more
difficult
area
unquestionably
but
let
me
deal
with
it
briefly.
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
primarily
in
it's
supplemental
brief
in
response
to
the
argument
that
i've
just
made,
the
government
says
in
effect,
“well,
there
isn't
any
purpose
in
the
immigration
and
the
judicial
review
of
immigration
orders'
area
to
require
that
there
would
be
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
as
the
base
for
the
direct
review
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i'm
not
entirely
clear
in
my
own
mind
whether
one
of
the
things
the
government
is
saying
is
that
in
this
area,
perhaps
as
distinguished
from
other
areas,
there
is
never
or
hardly
ever
any
case
that
goes
to
the
court
in
which
there
is
not
a
material
issue
of
disputed
fact
as
to
which
the
administrative
record
is
inadequate
if
it's
outside
of
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
if
they
are
saying
that,
i
do
not
agree.
i
think
that
is
not
demonstrable.
in
fact,
i
think
it
can
be
demonstrated
and
not
to
be
corrected.
i
do
think
that
if
all
they
mean
to
say
is
that
by
and
large,
the
judicial
review
of
ins
orders,
turn
on
legal
questions
that
don't
involve
material
issues
of
disputed
fact
and
the
records
are
by
and
large
adequate,
i
think
that
is
almost
surely
true.
i
think
that's
almost
surely
true
of
any
review
of
administrative
agencies.
by
and
large,
the
administrative
agencies
do
make
adequate
records
whether
or
not
the
statute
requires
it.
but
the
cases
that
the
government
cites,
established
that
this
is
not
always
so.
in
the
tahiti
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
case
that's
cited
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
their
supplemental
brief.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
courts
of
appeals
found
inadequacies
in
the
record.
inadeqacies
that
had
to
be
patched
up
before
those
courts
felt
that
they
could
adequately
review
the
case.
they
felt
there
could
not
be
inform
judicial
review.
we've
cited
another
case
in
our
brief.
i
just
try
another
ninth
circuit
across
another
ninth
circuit
case
of
the
same
court
kind
of
this
morning.
i
think
what
the
government
says
over
in
response
to
that
is
that
well,
perhaps
so,
there
might
be
cases
in
which
if
you
didn't
have
a
quasi-judicial
proceeding
required
by
statute
and
left
the
agency
to
it's
own
devices,
there
might
be
inadequacies
in
the
records
and
in
some
cases
of
judicial
review
but
still,
the
district
court
would
have
no
unique
function
to
perform.
it
might
as
well
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
of
course,
we're
talking
about
the
evidentiary
function
of
a
trial
court.
the
reason
that
that's
true,
the
government
says
is
that
in
such
a
case,
the
court
would
not
be
entitled
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
that
is
the
district
court.
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
agency
for
a
hearing,
for
a
further
hearing,
for
an
expanded
hearing.
now,
this
may
be
a
perfectly
sensible
approach
to
this
kind
of
problem
and
i
suspect
it
is,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
the
government
has
indicated
in
it's
brief,
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
a
federal
court
to
require
the
agency
to
hold
a
hearing
except
under
section
242
(b)
so
that
if
these
actions
are
taken
outside
of
242
(b)
and
putting
aside
of
course
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
requirement
in
some
cases,
i
see
no
basis
for
the
suggestion
that
a
federal
court
could
require
the
agency
to
patch
up
a
record
that
needed
patching.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
remanding
to
the
agency.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes.
well,
as
i
say,
it
is
possible
that
there's
some
way
that
this
kind
of
a
result
could
be
justified
and
as
i
say,
i
suspect
that
it's
probably
quite
a
reasonable
thing
to
do
but
in
this
area
in
the
bufalino
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
this
was
a
case
in
which
when
the
kind
of
action
that
the
ins
took
in
denying
discretionary
relief,
when
that
action
was
taken
under
the
regulations,
that
action
could
not
be
taken
under
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
declined
to
take
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
not
to
the
agency
but
to
the
district
court
for
the
taking
of
evidence.
so
that
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
cases
in
this
area
in
which
if
a
242
(b)
proceeding
is
not
held,
the
record
will
be
inadequate
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
district
court
may
well
have
a
unique
function
to
perform
in
building
inadequate
record
for
judicial
review.
and
in
those
circumstances,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
congress
to
act
as
it
did
in
differentiating
between
orders
entered
in
a
242
(b)
proceeding
and
orders
entered
outside
the
242
(b)
proceeding.
now,
the
government
suggest
that
there
will
be
practical
problems
that
will
arise
if
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed
and
they
speak
in
the
name
of
what
they
call
bifurcation
which
i
take
it
means
that
for
a
particular
alien
who
is
contesting
two
or
three
orders,
some
of
which
are
entered
in
the
242
(b)
proceeding
and
some
of
which
are
entered
by
the
district
director,
he
would
wind
up
in
two
different
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
i
don't
really
think
that
this
is
so
because
i
take
it
that
the
government
does
not
retreat
from
the
position
in
this
respect
that
it
took
in
foti
and
that
is
that
where
a
petition
for
review
is
properly
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
another
order
is
entered
by
a
district
court
outside
242
(b),
i
suggest
and
as
i
say,
i
think
the
government
agrees
that
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
is
applicable
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
discretion
to
be
sure
but
in
its
discretion
would
have
jurisdiction
over
both
issues.
i
see
that
this
is
an
issue
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
reach
in
foti
but
i
see
no
problem
with
it
so
far
as
traditional
backgrounds
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
are
concerned.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
still
and
all,
i
don't
know
that
the
problem
is
too
terribly
serious
and
certainly,
it
would
not
seem
to
me
to
involve
any
problems,
any
particular
problems
for
the
judiciary.
i
would
think
that
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
hold
the
petition
for
review
until
the
district
court
have
disposed
of
the
issues
before
it
and
then
if
the
district
court
action
didn't
move
the
case,
an
appeal
were
taken,
the
two
proceedings
at
that
point
would
be
consolidated.
now,
to
be
sure,
this
means
that
there
will
not
be
in
such
a
situation
the
kind
of
expedition
that
the
government
wants
and
this,
i
suppose,
brings
me
to
their
argument
taken
to
legislative
history.
the
government
rests
very
heavily
upon
the
legislative
history
that
demonstrates
and
it
certainly
does
demonstrate
that
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
section
106
not
just
this
provision
but
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
was
to
expedite
judicial
review
in
deportation
cases.
and
i
think
about
all
that
i
can
say
about
that
is
that
this
kind
of
a
evidence
of
a
general
legislative
purpose
cannot
survive
the
kind
of
statute
that
there
is
here
which
reflects,
i
suggest,
quite
clearly
a
limiting
subsidiary
purpose
to
confine
direct
review
to
cases
that
involve
orders
that
are
entered
in
quasi-judicial
proceedings.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
such
a
limiting
purpose.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
congress
intended
that
there
would
be
expedition
at
all
costs.
so
far
as
particular
legislative
history
bearing
upon
this
single
provision
is
concerned,
there
are
not
very
much.
the
government
relies
upon
--
primarily
upon
a
chart
which
is
appended
to
its
brief
at
page
55,
the
last
page
that
chart
in
term
was
appended
to
two
house
committee
reports.
i
must
confess
that
i've
had
real
difficulty
in
understanding
the
relevance
of
this
chart
to
the
particular
issue
involved
in
this
case.
as
i
look
at
that
chart,
all
that
it
means
to
me
and
all
that
i
suggest
any
as
what
have
said
about
it
in
the
house
reports
is
that
for
the
information
of
the
members
of
the
committee
and
the
information
of
the
members
of
the
congress,
the
committee
outlined
in
block
and
line
form,
everything
that
could
happen
once
a
deportable
alien
was
found
in
the
united
states
including
private
legislation
for
example.
private
legislation
falls
in
the
same
box
in
which
we
find
stay
of
deportation
and
the
line
goes
over
the
final
order
of
deportation
too.
well,
obviously
the
committee
didn't
mean
that
there
would
be
any
judicial
review
of
private
legislation
under
section
106
(a).
there
is
nothing
here,
i
suggest,
that
says
that
this
chart
was
meant
to
outline
the
various
kinds
of
procedural
steps
that
would
fall
within
section
106
(a),
and
that's
the
issue
here.
now,
for
our
part,
we
rely
upon
an
interchange
during
the
house
debates
on
this
legislation
between
congressman
libonati
and
congressman
walter.
congressman
walter
of
course
was
the
author
of
the
bill.
he
was
the
manager
of
the
bill
on
the
house
floor.
congressman
libonati
opposed
the
bill.
the
government
says
that
representative
libonati's
question
was
uninformed.
we
would
rather
characterize
it
as
penetrating.
and
they
say
that
representative
walter's
reply
was
cursory
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
was
very
discerning.
but
i
guess
the
words
will
have
to
speak
for
themselves.
but
what
happened
and
what
the
words
are
is
this.
representative
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
pages
32
and
33
of
my
brief.
representative
libonati
said
this,
“we
know
that
under
such
a
situation
that
is
under
direct
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
inquire
as
to
anything
beyond
the
written
record.
we
know
further
that
no
written
record
would
be
supplied
to
the
petitioner
in
the
proceeding.
it
would
merely
be
a
systematic
method
of
disposing
of
the
case
of
the
earliest
opportunity
without
any
question
as
to
the
relevant
facts
that
might
be
brought
into
the
case
by
the
petitioner
in
a
district
court
hearing
by
federal
district
judge.”
and
in
reply,
mr.
walter
said,
“i
respectfully
invite
the
gentleman's
attention
to
the
law
in
section
242
in
which
the
procedure
for
the
examiner
set
forth
in
detail.
the
gentleman
apparently
has
not
seen
this
section.”
now,
of
course,
representative
walter
might
not
have
been
thinking
fast
at
that
point
or
he
might
have
been
conceivably
just
trying
to
score
debaters
points
but
if
one
credits
what
he
says
as
it
seems
to
me
one
should.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
kind
of
things
that
i've
been
talking
about
this
morning,
the
possible
inadequacy
of
the
record
when
a
case
goes
from
an
order
entered
by
district
director
for
the
court
of
appeals.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
because
section
242
takes
care
of
it.
it
will
give
the
appellate
courts
inadequate
record
and
of
course
it
will
if
the
right
to
review
is
confined
to
orders
entered
in
the
context
of
section
242
(b)
proceedings.
now,
as
to
foti,
of
course
the
case
is
open
for
consideration
and
what
was
said
in
foti
can
be
modified.
but
i
should
think
there
isn't
any
serious
question
that
if
the
language
of
the
foti
opinion
is
applied
faithfully
to
this
case,
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
will
be
affirmed.
in
footnote
16
in
the
foti
case,
this
court
addressed
itself
specifically
to
the
problem
here.
the
problem
whether
an
order
in
that
particular
footnote
was
an
order
withholding
deportation.
whether
an
order
entered
outside
section
242
(b)
proceeding
would
fall
within
section
106
(a)
and
this
court
said
that
presumably,
it
would
not.
now,
this
is
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
upon
which
the
third
circuit
rely
and
certainly
at
the
very
least,
it
can
be
said
that
they
did
try
to
apply
without
qualification
the
most
recent
and
the
most
relevant
statement
by
this
court.
in
addition
to
that
in
the
text
of
the
foti
opinion,
the
court
repeatedly
stressed
the
consideration
that
he
order
involved
there
had
been
entered
in
a
section
242
(b)
proceeding.
if
the
government
is
right
today,
all
of
that
was
irrelevant
so
that
--
and
while
we
concede
that
the
holding
in
foti
is
not
governing
here
but
if
the
theory
of
the
government
is
accepted
here,
a
good
deal
of
what
was
said
in
foti
will
have
to
be
qualified
very
sharply.
and
i
suggest
that
in
an
area
and
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
has
generated
such
in
my
judgement
a
remarkable
amount
of
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
that
all
things
else
being
reasonably
equal,
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
as
consistent
of
pattern
of
rationale
in
this
court's
opinion
as
possible.
so
far
as
giova
is
concerned,
i
distinguish
giova
if
that's
the
proper
term
on
the
same
basis
that
the
solicitor
general
urged
upon
the
court
in
giova
itself.
the
solicitor
general
said
was
that
while
at
that
time
he
thought
that
orders
of
the
kind
we
have
involved
in
this
case
would
not
fall
within
106
(a)
because
it
entered
wholly
outside
the
242
(b)
proceedings.
at
the
same
time,
he
thought
that
--
well,
he
thought
giova
was
a
close
case.
at
the
same
time,
he
thought
that
it
was
appropriate
to
have
motions
to
reopen
a
242
proceeding
to
follow
the
same
path
through
the
courts
as
the
orders
entered
into
the
242
(b)
proceeding
itself
by
analogy
to
petitions
for
rehearing
in
courts
are
motions
for
new
trial,
things
of
that
sort
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
sensible.
that
concludes
i
think
the
major
things
i
would
have
to
say.
i
would
like
to
add
if
it's
appropriate
but
that
i
was
greatly
aided
in
this
case
by
the
particularly
having
no
particular
experience
in
this
area
by
the
open
and
fully
candid
and
very
helpful
cooperation
of
mr.
gordon
and
also
mr.
beytagh
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
i
appreciate
it
in
a
great
deal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
it's
a
great
pleasure
for
me.
