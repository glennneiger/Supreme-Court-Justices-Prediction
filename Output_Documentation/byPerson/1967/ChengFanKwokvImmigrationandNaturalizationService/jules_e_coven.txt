mr.
jules
e.
coven
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
petition
to
review
an
application
for
stay
of
deportation
made
to
the
district
director
of
the
immigration
service
in
new
jersey
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
pursuant
to
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
original,
initial
jurisdiction
of
this
matter
and
that
the
case
properly
belonged
in
the
district
court.
i
think
we
first
must
go
into
the
facts
in
the
matter
to
see
how
the
case
arose
and
why
it
was
started
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
district
court.
the
petitioners,
a
native
and
citizen
of
china,
went
to
the
united
states
as
a
crewman
in
1965.
he
had
a
deportation
hearing
in
march
of
1966
and
was
ordered
deported,
granted
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
the
only
relief
available
to
him
under
the
immigration
law
and
took
--
made
one
objection
to
the
government
procedure
during
the
deportation
hearing
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
the
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
not
an
issue
here,
however,
after
the
alien
did
not
depart
from
the
united
states
when
his
voluntary
departure
time
ran
out,
he
was
ordered
to
surrender
for
deportation
to
hong
kong.
to
go
back
a
little
bit
in
october
of
1965,
there
was
a
broad
base
amendment
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
and
for
the
first
time,
there
was
a
permanent
refugee
provision
written
into
the
law,
to
with
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
pursuant
to
this
section,
provision
was
made
for
refugees
from
communist-dominated
countries
to
make
application
for
admission
into
the
united
states
and
that
is
to
give
them
a
visa
number.
there
was
no
permanent
provision
in
the
immigration
law
prior
to
this.
the
alien
being
a
crewman,
was
not
able
to
adjust
pursuant
to
section
245
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
filed
an
application
with
the
district
director
in
newark,
new
jersey
for
a
stay
of
the
execution
of
his
deportation
order
on
the
ground
that
section
203
(a)
(7)
said
that
a
person
could
apply
for
relief
to
be
classified
as
a
refugee
in
any
non-communist
dominated
country.
peculiarly
enough,
the
administrative
regulations
set
up
only
seven
offices
throughout
the
world
and
none
in
the
orient.
they
set
up
offices
in
austria,
germany
and
some
other
countries
in
europe.
the
alien,
therefore,
felt
agreed
by
not
being
able
to
apply
for
relief
as
a
refugee
any
place
in
the
world,
any
place
that
he
possibly
could
get
through
in
the
world.
his
only
course
of
action
was
to
sue
the
government
to
declare
the
regulations
invalid
and
that
his
deportation
be
stayed
until
either
one
of
two
things
happened.
one,
the
district
director
in
newark,
new
jersey
rule
on
his
application
for
classification
as
a
refugee;
or
two,
the
government
would
be
directed
to
set
up
an
office
in
hong
kong
or
in
somewhere
in
the
orient
where
he
would
have
the
right
to
apply
for
relief
as
a
refugee.
when
he
submitted
his
application
for
the
stay
of
deportation,
there
was
no
claim
made
that
the
order
made
in
his
deportation
hearing
was
improper
in
any
way.
the
sole
claim
of
the
petitioner
was
that
the
government
was
improperly
denying
him
an
opportunity
to
apply
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
to
the
united
states.
theoretically
under
the
classification
program,
he
would
have
been
paroled
into
the
united
states
if
his
application
had
been
granted.
the
action
started
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
pursuant
to
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
this
is
a
statute
which
came
down
about
five
or
six
years
ago
and
has
been
the
source
of
constant
litigation
in
the
different
circuits
in
the
united
states.
the
lee
case
in
the
field
is
the
case
decided
by
this
court's
foti
versus
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
the
original
--
the
particular
section
of
section
106
says,
“the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
december
29th,
1950
shall
apply
to
and
shall
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure
for
the
judicial
review
of
all
final
orders
of
deportation
heretofore
that
hearing
made
against
aliens
within
the
united
states
pursuant
to
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).”
the
foti
case
which
came
to
this
court
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
this
law,
held
--
came
down
with
the
determination
that
the
application
for
discretionary
relief
may
do
in
a
242
(b)
deportation
proceedings,
was
reviewable
and
pursuant
to
section
106
(a).
the
argument
made
by
the
court
below,
that
was
the
second
circuit
was
that
since
this
was
not
a
final
order
of
deportation,
they
want
to
limit
the
statute
that
the
sole
actions
that
are
reviewable
initially
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
reviewable
of
an
order
as
to
whether
or
not
the
alien
was
to
be
deported
from
the
united
states
and
solely
that.
this
court
held
that
since
the
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
either
executed
or
suspended
the
deportation
order
and
since
if
the
application
--
if
the
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
was
granted,
the
deportation
order
would
fall
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
initial
jurisdiction
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course,
later
on
--
excuse
me.
in
the
foti
case,
this
court
stated
that
you're
not
going
to
rule
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
motion
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings
would
rest
in
the
court
of
appeals.
later
on
in
the
giova
versus
rosenberg
case,
this
court
in
a
memorandum
opinion
held
that
on
a
motion
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings,
the
court
of
appeals
had
original,
initial
jurisdiction.
the
case
of
today
goes
--
we
ask
that
the
statute
be
extended
further
that
a
stay
of
deportation,
an
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation
since
it
involves
the
suspension
or
the
execution
of
a
deportation
order
made
at
a
242
(b)
proceedings,
also
lies
originally
in
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course,
this
is
a
question
of
the
legislative
intent
of
congress
and
what
did
congress
intend
to
do
when
section
106
was
enacted.
it
was
stated
in
the
foti
case
that
congress
intended
to
set
up
a
single
statutory
scheme
in
which
an
alien
could
sue
the
immigration
service
in
a
deportation
matter,
and
they
wish
to
limit
the
delay
and
have
a
quick
determination
of
the
deportation
orders
based
upon
the
past
history
in
cases
before
the
courts,
the
deportation
of
aliens
in
the
united
states
were
delayed
because
of
the
litigation
pending
before
the
courts.
the
foti
case
--
there's
an
interesting
language
by
this
court
indicating
that
the
statute
should
not
be
strictly
construed
and
that
there
should
be
a
liberal
interpretation
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
said
--
in
the
foti
case
it
said
that,
“review
of
a
denial
of
a
discretionary
relief
is
ancillary
to
the
deportability
issue
and
both
determinations
therefore
should
be
made
by
the
same
court
at
the
same
time.
we
realize
that
deportability
such
as
in
this
case
is
conceded
in
a
large
number
of
cases
but
this
fact
hardly
detracts
from
our
view
as
to
a
proper
interpretation
of
section
106
(a).
there
of
course
had
been
many
different
decisions
in
the
different
circuits.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
a
case
blagaic
versus
flagg.
this
was
decided
before
the
foti
case
was
decided
by
this
court.
in
the
blagaic
versus
flagg
case,
the
alien
appeal
from
a
denial
of
an
application
pursuant
to
section
243
(h)
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
243
(h)
being
the
physical
persecution
section
of
the
statute.
in
the
blagaic
case,
the
government's
--
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
alien's
deportation
should
be
stayed
was
made
by
the
regional
commissioner
and
not
the
special
inquiry
officer
or
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
in
blagaic,
the
court
of
appeals
retain
jurisdiction
and
says,
“while
it's
true
that
the
only
question
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
abused
his
discretionary
refusing
to
withhold
deportations
under
section
1253
(h),
this
question
involves
the
execution
or
suspension
of
the
deportation
order
and
therefore
it
is
ancillary
to
the
order.
if
the
withholding
of
deportation
is
not
granted,
petitioner
will
be
deported.
thus
in
a
realistic
sense,
the
denial
of
a
stay
is
a
part
of
the
deportation
order.
blagaic
versus
flagg
has
--
there
would
be
no
question
now
that
an
application
pursuant
to
section
243
(h)
would
be
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
regulations
have
been
changed
and
now
placing
before
the
special
inquiry
officer,
the
applications
pursuant
to
section
243
(h).
mr.
jules
e.
coven
this
application
pursuant
to
the
regulations
would
be
submitted
to
a
district
director
or
immigration
officer.
mr.
jules
e.
coven
if
that
was
denied,
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
submitted
prior
to
the
deportation
proceeding.
it
was
submitted
prior
to
the
deportation
proceeding
--
no,
you
have
no
appeal
to
the
special
inquiry
officer
from
a
denial
of
a
203
(a)
(7)
application.
mr.
jules
e.
coven
i
would
say
that
since
if
the
203
(a)
(7)
application
were
denied
and
you
then
went
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
who
cannot
rule
on
a
203
(a)
(7)
application,
that
case
would
then
--
you
could
i
assume
and
raise
it
as
a
question
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
deported
and
then
after
the
final
order
of
deportation
was
entered
and
then
i
would
say
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
possibly
very
similar
to
what
could
have
happened
in
this
case
if
the
alien
was
not
a
crewman.
see,
the
alien
not
being
--
being
a
crewman
was
barred
from
adjusting
his
status
in
the
united
states,
not
this
particular
alien
but
an
alien
who
had
been
here
for
two
years
would
be
barred
from
adjusting.
and
therefore
if
he
went
before
a
special
inquiry
officer,
i
assume
he
could
raise
it.
i
--
it
would
have
to
be
denied
under
the
present
regulations
but
then
it
certainly
would
lie
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
--
there
is
another
case
which
certiorari
was
granted
where
the
action
i
think
can
be
more
clearly
seen.
in
number
638,
cheng
kwan
chong
where
certiorari
was
also
granted
but
this
case,
it
was
argued
rather
in
637,
excuse
me,
was
argued.
there
was
a
case
of
an
alien
who
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
more
than
two
years.
pursuant
to
section
203
(a)
(7),
we
raise
the
objection
that
203
(a)
(7)
would
permit
the
alien
to
adjust
his
status
in
the
united
states
with
that,
even
though
he
was
a
crewman
since
we
allege
that
the
government
interpretation
that
245
apply,
the
adjustment
of
status
provision,
that
case
of
course,
if
the
203
(a)
(7)
application
had
been
granted
and
if
he
could
adjust
not
under
section
245,
there
is,
i
feel
no
question
in
that
case.
the
grant
or
denial
would
effectively
act
as
a
execution
or
suspension
of
the
deportation
order.
and
here,
the
case
is
frankly
is
almost
as
far
as
you
can
go
with
a
broad
interpretation
of
section
106.
there
is
a
point
raised
in
one
of
the
cases
that
the
government
regulations
in
the
yamada
versus
ins
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
court
there
in
dismissing
a
petition
for
review
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
grounds
said
that,
the
government
could
place
more
of
the
applications
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
they
meant
to
expedite
the
judicial
review
by
regulation
such
as
they
did
in
blagaic
versus
flagg
case.
of
course,
there
are
many
applications
that
could
be
sued
upon
and
i
assume
that
even
if
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
there
still
will
be
cases
that
would
go
to
the
district
court
which
did
not
involve
deportation.
i
think
a
case
of
an
alien,
a
person
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
petitions
files
a
visa
petition
for
somebody
outside
of
the
united
states
if
this
action
was
denied
could
still
sue
in
the
district
court
for
an
order
to
grant
the
visa
petition
since
he
is
a
party
in
interest.
i
think
i
like
to
--
i
think
we
must
get
down
to
the
basics
as
--
is
anybody
injured
in
anyway
by
the
court
of
appeals
having
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
district
court.
and
the
government
raise
--
the
amicus
curiae
raises
the
situation
that
here,
there
is
no
record
to
review.
well,
the
record
to
review
here,
this
is
a
question
of
law.
the
record
to
review
is
immaterial
as
the
administrative
record
of
the
deportation
hearing
was
not
--
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
was
not
in
any
part
of
any
appendix
because
deportability
was
conceded,
however,
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
could
have
made
a
proper
ruling
on
the
application
for
the
stay
of
deportation
since
the
solely
the
question
of
law
was
involved.
in
fact,
in
the
hobbs
act,
which
section
106
(a)
is
tailored
after,
there
is
a
statement,
one
of
the
state
--
section
2347
says
that,
the
court
of
appeals
can
pass
on
the
issues
presented
when
a
hearing
is
not
required
by
law
and
that
appearing
from
the
pleadings
and
affidavits
filed
by
the
party
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
that's
presented.
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
it
stresses
very
strongly
that
since
there
is
no
record
before
the
court,
they
can't
review
it
because
there
is
no
testimony
held.
while
in
the
hobbs
act,
they
have
do
have
the
exception
to
the
question
where
no
hearing
is
required.
and
under
the
present
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
there
is
no
hearing
held
and
the
question
is
submitted
to
a
district
director
who
makes
it
on
the
record
in
his
file.
i
think
in
the
--
the
last
line
in
foti,
therefore
this
matter
can
and
should
be
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
resulting
in
a
judicial
review
procedure
that
would
be
both
fair
to
the
petitioner
and
expeditious
for
the
government
and
when
this
act
was
passed
by
congress,
the
main
purpose
was
to
have
an
expeditious
review
of
all
deportation
orders.
thank
you.
mr.
jules
e.
coven
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
petition
to
review
an
application
for
stay
of
deportation
made
to
the
district
director
of
the
immigration
service
in
new
jersey
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
pursuant
to
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
original,
initial
jurisdiction
of
this
matter
and
that
the
case
properly
belonged
in
the
district
court.
i
think
we
first
must
go
into
the
facts
in
the
matter
to
see
how
the
case
arose
and
why
it
was
started
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
district
court.
the
petitioners,
a
native
and
citizen
of
china,
went
to
the
united
states
as
a
crewman
in
1965.
he
had
a
deportation
hearing
in
march
of
1966
and
was
ordered
deported,
granted
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
the
only
relief
available
to
him
under
the
immigration
law
and
took
--
made
one
objection
to
the
government
procedure
during
the
deportation
hearing
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
the
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
not
an
issue
here,
however,
after
the
alien
did
not
depart
from
the
united
states
when
his
voluntary
departure
time
ran
out,
he
was
ordered
to
surrender
for
deportation
to
hong
kong.
to
go
back
a
little
bit
in
october
of
1965,
there
was
a
broad
base
amendment
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
and
for
the
first
time,
there
was
a
permanent
refugee
provision
written
into
the
law,
to
with
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
pursuant
to
this
section,
provision
was
made
for
refugees
from
communist-dominated
countries
to
make
application
for
admission
into
the
united
states
and
that
is
to
give
them
a
visa
number.
there
was
no
permanent
provision
in
the
immigration
law
prior
to
this.
the
alien
being
a
crewman,
was
not
able
to
adjust
pursuant
to
section
245
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
filed
an
application
with
the
district
director
in
newark,
new
jersey
for
a
stay
of
the
execution
of
his
deportation
order
on
the
ground
that
section
203
(a)
(7)
said
that
a
person
could
apply
for
relief
to
be
classified
as
a
refugee
in
any
non-communist
dominated
country.
peculiarly
enough,
the
administrative
regulations
set
up
only
seven
offices
throughout
the
world
and
none
in
the
orient.
they
set
up
offices
in
austria,
germany
and
some
other
countries
in
europe.
the
alien,
therefore,
felt
agreed
by
not
being
able
to
apply
for
relief
as
a
refugee
any
place
in
the
world,
any
place
that
he
possibly
could
get
through
in
the
world.
his
only
course
of
action
was
to
sue
the
government
to
declare
the
regulations
invalid
and
that
his
deportation
be
stayed
until
either
one
of
two
things
happened.
one,
the
district
director
in
newark,
new
jersey
rule
on
his
application
for
classification
as
a
refugee;
or
two,
the
government
would
be
directed
to
set
up
an
office
in
hong
kong
or
in
somewhere
in
the
orient
where
he
would
have
the
right
to
apply
for
relief
as
a
refugee.
when
he
submitted
his
application
for
the
stay
of
deportation,
there
was
no
claim
made
that
the
order
made
in
his
deportation
hearing
was
improper
in
any
way.
the
sole
claim
of
the
petitioner
was
that
the
government
was
improperly
denying
him
an
opportunity
to
apply
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
to
the
united
states.
theoretically
under
the
classification
program,
he
would
have
been
paroled
into
the
united
states
if
his
application
had
been
granted.
the
action
started
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
pursuant
to
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
this
is
a
statute
which
came
down
about
five
or
six
years
ago
and
has
been
the
source
of
constant
litigation
in
the
different
circuits
in
the
united
states.
the
lee
case
in
the
field
is
the
case
decided
by
this
court's
foti
versus
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
the
original
--
the
particular
section
of
section
106
says,
“the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
december
29th,
1950
shall
apply
to
and
shall
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure
for
the
judicial
review
of
all
final
orders
of
deportation
heretofore
that
hearing
made
against
aliens
within
the
united
states
pursuant
to
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).”
the
foti
case
which
came
to
this
court
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
this
law,
held
--
came
down
with
the
determination
that
the
application
for
discretionary
relief
may
do
in
a
242
(b)
deportation
proceedings,
was
reviewable
and
pursuant
to
section
106
(a).
the
argument
made
by
the
court
below,
that
was
the
second
circuit
was
that
since
this
was
not
a
final
order
of
deportation,
they
want
to
limit
the
statute
that
the
sole
actions
that
are
reviewable
initially
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
reviewable
of
an
order
as
to
whether
or
not
the
alien
was
to
be
deported
from
the
united
states
and
solely
that.
this
court
held
that
since
the
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
either
executed
or
suspended
the
deportation
order
and
since
if
the
application
--
if
the
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
was
granted,
the
deportation
order
would
fall
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
initial
jurisdiction
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course,
later
on
--
excuse
me.
in
the
foti
case,
this
court
stated
that
you're
not
going
to
rule
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
motion
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings
would
rest
in
the
court
of
appeals.
later
on
in
the
giova
versus
rosenberg
case,
this
court
in
a
memorandum
opinion
held
that
on
a
motion
to
reopen
deportation
proceedings,
the
court
of
appeals
had
original,
initial
jurisdiction.
the
case
of
today
goes
--
we
ask
that
the
statute
be
extended
further
that
a
stay
of
deportation,
an
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation
since
it
involves
the
suspension
or
the
execution
of
a
deportation
order
made
at
a
242
(b)
proceedings,
also
lies
originally
in
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course,
this
is
a
question
of
the
legislative
intent
of
congress
and
what
did
congress
intend
to
do
when
section
106
was
enacted.
it
was
stated
in
the
foti
case
that
congress
intended
to
set
up
a
single
statutory
scheme
in
which
an
alien
could
sue
the
immigration
service
in
a
deportation
matter,
and
they
wish
to
limit
the
delay
and
have
a
quick
determination
of
the
deportation
orders
based
upon
the
past
history
in
cases
before
the
courts,
the
deportation
of
aliens
in
the
united
states
were
delayed
because
of
the
litigation
pending
before
the
courts.
the
foti
case
--
there's
an
interesting
language
by
this
court
indicating
that
the
statute
should
not
be
strictly
construed
and
that
there
should
be
a
liberal
interpretation
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
said
--
in
the
foti
case
it
said
that,
“review
of
a
denial
of
a
discretionary
relief
is
ancillary
to
the
deportability
issue
and
both
determinations
therefore
should
be
made
by
the
same
court
at
the
same
time.
we
realize
that
deportability
such
as
in
this
case
is
conceded
in
a
large
number
of
cases
but
this
fact
hardly
detracts
from
our
view
as
to
a
proper
interpretation
of
section
106
(a).
there
of
course
had
been
many
different
decisions
in
the
different
circuits.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
a
case
blagaic
versus
flagg.
this
was
decided
before
the
foti
case
was
decided
by
this
court.
in
the
blagaic
versus
flagg
case,
the
alien
appeal
from
a
denial
of
an
application
pursuant
to
section
243
(h)
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
243
(h)
being
the
physical
persecution
section
of
the
statute.
in
the
blagaic
case,
the
government's
--
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
alien's
deportation
should
be
stayed
was
made
by
the
regional
commissioner
and
not
the
special
inquiry
officer
or
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
in
blagaic,
the
court
of
appeals
retain
jurisdiction
and
says,
“while
it's
true
that
the
only
question
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
abused
his
discretionary
refusing
to
withhold
deportations
under
section
1253
(h),
this
question
involves
the
execution
or
suspension
of
the
deportation
order
and
therefore
it
is
ancillary
to
the
order.
if
the
withholding
of
deportation
is
not
granted,
petitioner
will
be
deported.
thus
in
a
realistic
sense,
the
denial
of
a
stay
is
a
part
of
the
deportation
order.
blagaic
versus
flagg
has
--
there
would
be
no
question
now
that
an
application
pursuant
to
section
243
(h)
would
be
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
regulations
have
been
changed
and
now
placing
before
the
special
inquiry
officer,
the
applications
pursuant
to
section
243
(h).
mr.
jules
e.
coven
this
application
pursuant
to
the
regulations
would
be
submitted
to
a
district
director
or
immigration
officer.
mr.
jules
e.
coven
if
that
was
denied,
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
submitted
prior
to
the
deportation
proceeding.
it
was
submitted
prior
to
the
deportation
proceeding
--
no,
you
have
no
appeal
to
the
special
inquiry
officer
from
a
denial
of
a
203
(a)
(7)
application.
mr.
jules
e.
coven
i
would
say
that
since
if
the
203
(a)
(7)
application
were
denied
and
you
then
went
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
who
cannot
rule
on
a
203
(a)
(7)
application,
that
case
would
then
--
you
could
i
assume
and
raise
it
as
a
question
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
deported
and
then
after
the
final
order
of
deportation
was
entered
and
then
i
would
say
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
possibly
very
similar
to
what
could
have
happened
in
this
case
if
the
alien
was
not
a
crewman.
see,
the
alien
not
being
--
being
a
crewman
was
barred
from
adjusting
his
status
in
the
united
states,
not
this
particular
alien
but
an
alien
who
had
been
here
for
two
years
would
be
barred
from
adjusting.
and
therefore
if
he
went
before
a
special
inquiry
officer,
i
assume
he
could
raise
it.
i
--
it
would
have
to
be
denied
under
the
present
regulations
but
then
it
certainly
would
lie
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
--
there
is
another
case
which
certiorari
was
granted
where
the
action
i
think
can
be
more
clearly
seen.
in
number
638,
cheng
kwan
chong
where
certiorari
was
also
granted
but
this
case,
it
was
argued
rather
in
637,
excuse
me,
was
argued.
there
was
a
case
of
an
alien
who
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
more
than
two
years.
pursuant
to
section
203
(a)
(7),
we
raise
the
objection
that
203
(a)
(7)
would
permit
the
alien
to
adjust
his
status
in
the
united
states
with
that,
even
though
he
was
a
crewman
since
we
allege
that
the
government
interpretation
that
245
apply,
the
adjustment
of
status
provision,
that
case
of
course,
if
the
203
(a)
(7)
application
had
been
granted
and
if
he
could
adjust
not
under
section
245,
there
is,
i
feel
no
question
in
that
case.
the
grant
or
denial
would
effectively
act
as
a
execution
or
suspension
of
the
deportation
order.
and
here,
the
case
is
frankly
is
almost
as
far
as
you
can
go
with
a
broad
interpretation
of
section
106.
there
is
a
point
raised
in
one
of
the
cases
that
the
government
regulations
in
the
yamada
versus
ins
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
court
there
in
dismissing
a
petition
for
review
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
grounds
said
that,
the
government
could
place
more
of
the
applications
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
they
meant
to
expedite
the
judicial
review
by
regulation
such
as
they
did
in
blagaic
versus
flagg
case.
of
course,
there
are
many
applications
that
could
be
sued
upon
and
i
assume
that
even
if
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
there
still
will
be
cases
that
would
go
to
the
district
court
which
did
not
involve
deportation.
i
think
a
case
of
an
alien,
a
person
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
petitions
files
a
visa
petition
for
somebody
outside
of
the
united
states
if
this
action
was
denied
could
still
sue
in
the
district
court
for
an
order
to
grant
the
visa
petition
since
he
is
a
party
in
interest.
i
think
i
like
to
--
i
think
we
must
get
down
to
the
basics
as
--
is
anybody
injured
in
anyway
by
the
court
of
appeals
having
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
district
court.
and
the
government
raise
--
the
amicus
curiae
raises
the
situation
that
here,
there
is
no
record
to
review.
well,
the
record
to
review
here,
this
is
a
question
of
law.
the
record
to
review
is
immaterial
as
the
administrative
record
of
the
deportation
hearing
was
not
--
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
was
not
in
any
part
of
any
appendix
because
deportability
was
conceded,
however,
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
could
have
made
a
proper
ruling
on
the
application
for
the
stay
of
deportation
since
the
solely
the
question
of
law
was
involved.
in
fact,
in
the
hobbs
act,
which
section
106
(a)
is
tailored
after,
there
is
a
statement,
one
of
the
state
--
section
2347
says
that,
the
court
of
appeals
can
pass
on
the
issues
presented
when
a
hearing
is
not
required
by
law
and
that
appearing
from
the
pleadings
and
affidavits
filed
by
the
party
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
that's
presented.
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
it
stresses
very
strongly
that
since
there
is
no
record
before
the
court,
they
can't
review
it
because
there
is
no
testimony
held.
while
in
the
hobbs
act,
they
have
do
have
the
exception
to
the
question
where
no
hearing
is
required.
and
under
the
present
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
there
is
no
hearing
held
and
the
question
is
submitted
to
a
district
director
who
makes
it
on
the
record
in
his
file.
i
think
in
the
--
the
last
line
in
foti,
therefore
this
matter
can
and
should
be
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
resulting
in
a
judicial
review
procedure
that
would
be
both
fair
to
the
petitioner
and
expeditious
for
the
government
and
when
this
act
was
passed
by
congress,
the
main
purpose
was
to
have
an
expeditious
review
of
all
deportation
orders.
thank
you.
