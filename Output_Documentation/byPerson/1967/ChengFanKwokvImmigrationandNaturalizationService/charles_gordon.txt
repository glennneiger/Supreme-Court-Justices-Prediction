mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
third
time
in
five
years,
this
court
is
asked
to
pass
on
the
statutory
provisions
for
the
review
of
deportation
orders.
its
first
two
decisions
in
1963
--
1965
--
1963
and
1964,
endorsed
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
today,
we
ask
the
court
to
go
a
step
further
and
to
hold
that
the
special
review
procedure
of
the
statute
is
applicable
to
the
denial
of
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
deportation.
now,
our
primary
concern
here
is
to
seek
an
interpretation
which
will
effectuate
the
statutory
intent
and
also
to
end
the
fruitless
jurisdictional
disputes
in
the
act
phrased
of
the
court
below
and
the
second
circuit
which
have
blocked
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
deportation
laws.
while
we
believe
that
the
substantive
portion
of
this
challenge
lacks
merit,
we're
not
arguing
the
merits
here.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
petitioner,
no
one
denies
that
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
judicial
review.
the
only
issue
is
whether
his
petition
should
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
a
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
this
depends
of
course
on
an
interpretation
of
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
admittedly,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unclear
but
its
major
purpose
is
unmistakable
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
foti.
the
dominant
goal
of
the
statute
and
i
quote,
“was
to
abbreviate
the
process
of
judicial
review
of
deportation
orders
in
order
to
frustrate
dilatory
attacks
in
the
courts.”
now,
the
court
went
on
to
say,
again
i
quote,
“the
key
feature
of
the
congressional
plan
aimed,
directed
at
this
problem
was
the
elimination
of
the
initial
first
step
in
the
obtaining
judicial
review,
a
suit
in
the
district
court.”
the
legislative
history
is
discussed
in
foti
and
in
our
view
it
abundantly
supports
the
court's
analysis.
now,
the
court
below
did
not
dispute
these
legislative
objectives.
however,
it
relied
on
this
court's
rulings
in
foti
and
giova
to
support
a
determination
that
since
motions
for
stay
of
deportation
were
addressed
to
a
district
director
rather
than
a
special
inquiry
officer,
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction.
now,
while
the
foti
opinion
did
emphasize
the
special
inquiry
officer's
role,
it
did
so,
i
believe,
in
addressing
the
specific
problem
before
the
court
in
that
case
which
was
an
effort
to
bifurcate
judicial
review
of
different
portions
of
the
special
inquiry
officer's
decision.
indeed,
in
reserving
the
question
which
was
later
decided
in
giova,
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
foti
stated,
relating
to
the
motion
to
reopen,
“the
question
is
admittedly
a
different
one
since
such
an
administrative
determination
is
not
made
during
the
same
proceeding
where
deportability
is
determined
and
discretionary
relief
is
denied.”
now,
in
the
light
of
that
reservation
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
not
unreasonable
to
read
the
holding
in
giova
as
sanctioning
at
least
some
review
of
ancillary
determinations.
now,
i
shall
not
attempt
to
debate
with
the
able
amicus
as
to
what
we
said
in
our
briefs
in
foti
and
giova.
since
then,
we
have
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
opinions
in
foti
and
giova
cases
and
also,
of
the
developing
litigation
thereafter
and
studying
the
statute
in
the
light
of
that
experience
and
in
the
context
of
actual
cases.
we
have
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
the
interpretation
for
which
we
argue
today
is
not
only
necessary
but
proper.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
narrow
reading
which
is
favored
by
the
court
below
is
not
only
artificially
literal
but
that
it
defeats
the
statutory
purpose
of
abbreviating
the
language
of
the
court
in
foti,
to
abbreviate
the
process
of
review
of
deportation
orders.
the
relevant
language
of
section
106
(a)
says
nothing
about
special
inquiry
officers.
those
officers
unquestionably
perform
an
important
function
in
the
deportation
process.
but
their
role
relates
to
only
one
segment
of
that
process.
total
responsibility
for
the
deportation
process
resides
in
the
attorney
general
under
whom
the
special
inquiry
officer
serves.
now
obviously,
the
court
below
would
not
deny
judicial
review
of
the
determinations
involved
here.
what
it
would
do
was
--
would
be
to
channel
them
into
the
district
court
to
hold
that
some
portions
of
the
deportation
process
are
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
other
portions
in
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me,
invites
the
very
type
of
bifurcation
of
review
which
court
deplored
in
foti.
moreover,
it
would
ignore
the
obvious
congressional
concern
with
challenges
to
the
deportation
order
after
the
basic
order
was
entered.
now,
that
concern
is
reviewed
--
is
shown
in
the
typical
cases
of
abuse
which
are
listed
in
the
committee
reports
and
which
were
referred
to
in
this
court's
opinion
in
foti.
now,
i
urge
the
desirability
of
reading
the
statute
in
a
manner
which
will
effectuate
the
purpose
that
congress
unquestionably
sought
to
achieve.
in
my
view,
the
statute
can
and
should
be
read
as
including
determinations
which
are
ancillary
to
and
would
directly
affect
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
which
is
against
this
has
conceded
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
such
an
interpretation
if
congress
is
found
to
have
intended
it.
now,
the
language
which
has
caused
the
difficulty
appears
in
two
phrases
of
the
statute.
the
first
is
the
statutory
reference
to
final
orders
of
deportation,
and
the
second
is
the
reference
to
such
orders
or
determinations
and
pursuant
--
this
is
the
language
in
the
statute,
“pursuant
to
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
this
act.”
in
foti,
this
court
rejected
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
first
raised,
final
order
of
deportation.
since
then,
some
of
the
courts
favoring
a
restrictive
interpretation
have
relied
on
the
second
phrase,
the
pursuant
phrase.
the
legislative
history
has
no
direct
evidence
of
the
purpose
the
congress
sought
to
achieve
by
this
second
phrase.
it
was
introduced
by
representative
walter
in
his
1958
bill
which
furnished
the
basis
on
which
the
law
was
finally
enacted.
it
really
was
substantially
the
final
law.
now,
representative
walter
didn't
explain
why
he
was
introducing
this
new
language.
but
my
own
belief
has
always
been
that
this
second
phrase
was
added
by
representative
walter
in
order
to
make
certain
that
the
new
review
procedure
that
he
proposed
would
not
be
applied
to
exclusion
proceedings.
throughout
the
legislative
consideration
of
this
measure,
there
are
repeated
statements
by
representative
walter,
by
other
members
of
congress
in
the
committee
reports
in
which
a
concern
is
expressed
for
a
limitation
of
the
type
of
judicial
review
that
will
be
available
in
relation
to
exclusion
proceedings.
section
106
(b)
of
the
statute
does
specifically
limit
such
review
to
habeas
corpus
in
exclusion
cases.
now,
representative
walter,
as
an
expert
in
this
field
was
aware
that
the
immigration
statute
in
referring
to
orders
of
exclusion
and
of
deportation
in
both
instances,
talks
of
aliens
being
deported.
and
it
is
my
belief,
admittedly
without
any
direct
evidence
that
when
representative
walter
added
the
second
phrase,
he
did
so
with
the
hope
that
he
would
avert
any
construction
of
the
statute
and
would
apply
it
to
the
review
of
exclusion
orders.
and
incidentally,
i
might
mention
that
some
enterprising
sole
has
actually
made
such
a
contention.
it
has
been
read
that
the
statute
applies
to
exclusion
orders,
that
contention
has
been
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
is
pending
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
part
of
our
submission.
we
think
it's
not
necessary
for
this
case.
we
believe
that
any
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
that's
clearly
within
the
statute
but
i
think
that
if
he
applies
to
the
district
director
for
an
order
which
will
make
him
unlawful
resident
of
united
states,
that
in
itself
will
initiate
the
deportation
order
and
itself
applies
to
the
deportation
order
and
should
be
reviewable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly
sir.
our
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
operates
directly
on
that
order.
it
may
cancel
it.
it
may
delay
it.
it
prevents
its
execution
and
we
think
that's
part
of
the
final
deportation
order
which
the
statute
speaks.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
connection
with
the
203
(a)
(7)
you're
talking
about.
mr.
charles
gordon
or
any
application
that
he
makes,
if
he
makes
an
application
for
what
we
call
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
charles
gordon
everything
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
adjustment
of
status
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
classification
made
to
some
extent
would
be
discretionary.
but
these
are
separate
discretionary
applications.
the
one
that
you
suggest
is
an
application
which
may
make
him
a
lawful,
permanent
resident
of
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
it
is
in
our
view
a
totally
meritless
ground
because
he
has
to
make
such
an
application
outside
united
states.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
an
application
of
that
kind
in
the
united
states.
that's
been
held
by
a
couple
of
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
has
been
denied
by
this
court.
now,
turning
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
of
course
we
have
to
rely
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
believe
a
reading
of
the
statute
--
the
reading
that
we
suggest
here
is
amply
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statue
considered
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
purpose.
the
statute
speaks
of
orders
made
pursuant
to
section
242
(b).
it
doesn't
say
in
section
242
(b)
proceedings.
it
doesn't
say
in
proceedings
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
says,
in
proceedings
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
now,
to
me,
that
language
necessarily
includes
an
order
of
the
type
here,
denying
an
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
that
determination
to
me
is
a
determination
pursuant
to
that
242
(b)
proceeding.
now,
to
treat
this
court
of
course
in
the
giova
case,
considered
a
very
similar
type
of
application,
an
application
for
reopening
the
proceedings.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
that
application
was
presented
four-and-a-half
years
after
the
basic
--
yet
the
court
in
giova,
found
that
that
type
of
application,
that
type
of
determination
since
it
bore
on
the
basic
order
and
since
it
affected
the
execution
of
the
order
was
reviewable
under
section
106
(a).
now,
a
motion
to
reopen
and
a
motion
for
a
stay
are
often
presented
together.
they
request
similar
relief.
both
of
them
seek
to
operate
on
the
deportation
order.
to
treat
these
two
types
of
applications
differently
because
under
present
regulations,
they
are
considered
by
different
officers,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
placing
emphasis
only
on
the
label
which
is
placed
on
the
application
because
our
experience
has
been
that
applications
of
the
very
type
that
is
under
consideration
here
sometimes
had
been
presented
in
the
form
of
motions
to
reopen
and
that
was
done
in
the
lee
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
sometimes
they
have
been
presented
in
the
form
of
motions
for
stay.
to
treat
them
differently
in
our
view
would
represent
a
triumph
of
form
of
a
substance.
now,
i
believe
the
essential
error
of
the
courts
which
have
favored
a
restrictive
interpretation
is
their
failure
to
view
the
entire
deportation
process
and
its
entirety
and
concentrating
only
on
one
aspect
of
it.
i
would
divide
and
i
have
in
the
brief
suggested
this
division.
i
would
divide
the
deportation
process
into
three
stages.
in
each
of
them
they're
on
the
final
deportation
order
and
on
the
proceedings
pursuant
to
section
242
(b).
the
first
is
what
i
have
called
ancillary
--
antecedent
determinations.
these
are
proceedings
or
determinations
leading
up
to
the
institutional
proceedings.
for
example,
a
person
may
be
here
in
the
united
states
temporarily
and
asked
for
an
extension
of
stay
and
that's
denied
or
he
may
be
here
as
an
exchange
visitor
who
has
to
leave.
he
seeks
a
waiver
which
would
permit
him
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states
or
he
seeks
a
visa
petition
which
would
enable
him
also
to
remain
permanently.
each
of
this
is
denied.
deportation
proceedings
are
commenced.
that's
the
first
stage,
the
antecedent
determination.
the
second
stage
in
which
i
would
classify
the
entire
process
is
what
i
call
integral
determinations.
these
are
determinations
within
the
actual
proceeding
itself,
the
hearing
proceeding.
foti
set
out
the
reviewability
of
all
determinations
made
in
the
integral
part
of
the
proceeding.
and
the
third
of
these
groupings
that
i've
made,
i
call
subsequent
determinations.
these
in
turn
can
be
divided
into
two
parts.
first,
would
be
determinations
bearing
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order;
and
second,
would
be
determinations
which
bear
on
the
order
less
directly
but
if
granted
would
vitiate
the
order
or
modify
its
effect.
in
the
light
of
this
complete
picture
of
the
process
in
all
of
its
stages,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
attempt
to
distinguish
this
court's
holding
in
giova
cannot
be
supported,
motions
to
reopen,
motions
for
a
stay
which
were
involved
in
giova
and
motions
for
a
stay
of
deportation
relate
equally
to
this
third
stage
of
the
deportation
process
subsequent
determinations,
moreover,
they
bear
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order.
indeed,
the
explicit
intent
of
congress
to
include
motions
to
stay
deportation
within
the
advent
of
section
106
(a)
is
revealed
in
a
chart
which
is
appended
to
the
committee
reports
in
which
we've
reproduced
as
appendix
b
of
our
brief,
page
55,
our
principal
brief.
now,
your
honors,
the
notes
said,
the
deportation
process
is
treated
in
various
stages
and
various
boxes
and
then
they
get
down
to
what
they
call
final
order
of
deportation
and
alongside
of
it,
there's
a
line,
stay
of
deportation.
in
other
words,
the
congressional
committees
which
drafted
this
law,
which
reported
on
it
in
their
reports
appended
this
chart
in
which
they
viewed
the
deportation
process
as
consisting
of
several
stages
and
at
the
end
of
it
on
the
same
line
as
the
final
order
of
deportation
as
an
adjunct
of
that
order,
they
list
the
stay
of
deportation.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
quite
that
easy
as
we've
suggested
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
let
me
answer
it
then.
i
agree
and
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
amicus
and
everybody
else
who
has
made
all
these
kind
of
suggestions
to
us
to
change
our
regulations.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
very
useful
if
we
could
get
everything
into
one
proceeding
because
then
you'd
have
one
review
and
it's
very
--
certainly
very
desirable
to
have
only
one
review
but
the
fact
is
that
you
can't
get
everything
into
one
proceeding.
you
can't
get
some
antecedent
determinations
into
the
same
proceeding
because
they
don't
relate
to
any
deportation
proceeding.
there's
no
deportation
proceeding
in
prospect
unless
the
application
is
denied.
why
put
the
man
to
a
deportation
proceeding.
as
to
subsequent
determinations,
it's
very
unlikely
that
you
can
get
most
of
them
into
the
deportation
proceeding.
you
could
say,
go
to
one
special
officer
but
that's
outside
the
proceeding
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
reservation
in
the
foti
case.
all
these
things
happen
after
the
deportation
order
is
entered.
for
example,
let's
take
the
mechanics
of
executing
the
deportation
order.
after
the
order
is
entered,
it
is
necessary
to
take
steps
and
it
becomes
final
if
necessary
to
take
steps
to
execute
it.
the
immigration
service
has
to
apply
to
foreign
governments
for
documents.
it
has
to
deal
with
transportation
lines.
now,
you
might
say,
“well,
what
kind
of
judicial
process
would
approach
this
type
of
determination?”
well,
this
is
not
a
fantasy
on
my
part.
we
have
here
before
the
court
a
case
on
which
a
deportee
who
has
gone
through
two
rounds
of
full
judicial
review
now
seeks
to
attack
in
the
district
court.
the
representations
he
alleges,
the
district
director
made
to
the
government
of
italy
in
executing
the
deportation
order.
so
you
see,
that
type
of
subsequent
determination
can't
go
into
the
deportation
proceeding.
now,
there
are
also
practical
considerations.
the
special
inquiry
officer
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
transportation
lines.
he
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
foreign
governments.
circumstances
arise
years
later
as
was
shown
in
the
giova
case,
years
after
the
proceeding
is
completed,
a
new
law
is
passed
and
this
happens
all
the
time.
people
seek
--
are
really
fond
of
that
law.
a
man
marries
an
american
citizen
and
claims
benefits
as
a
result
of
that
status
or
a
new
--
an
american
citizen
child
is
born
to
him
and
he
claims
benefits.
so
all
these
things
come
up
later,
it's
impossible
to
join
them
into
the
state
proceeding.
it
might
be
possible
to
say
that
you
go
to
a
special
inquiry
officer
to
have
these
applications
considered.
but
to
us,
that
doesn't
alter
the
relationship
of
the
determination
and
the
process
to
the
essential
final
deportation
order.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
would
be
possible
but
--
mr.
charles
gordon
not
now,
nor
under
the
present
regulations.
we
have
amended
our
regulations.
we
gradually
have
tried
to
move
as
much
as
we
can
towards
the
unified
proceeding.
we
have
amended
our
regulations
to
give
the
special
inquiry
officer
authority
to
grant
a
stay
next
with
the
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
all.
well,
you
see,
most
practical
consideration
now
--
mr.
charles
gordon
district
directors
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
special
inquiry
officers
throughout
the
united
states
too
but
they're
no
always
in
the
place
where
the
stay
is
sought
at
the
last
minute.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
yes.
of
course
and
mechanics.
it
would
be
impossible
in
many
cases
to
consider
this.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
district
directors.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
district
directors
and
it
has
always
been
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
the
hearing
on
the
determination
of
deportability.
no
stay
of
deportation.
that
was
a
function
and
it's
still
a
function
of
the
district
director.
now,
i've
called
attention
to
this
chart
and
i
see
my
time
is
running
off.
we'll
pass
the
chart
if
we
could
discuss
that
now.
now,
i
think
in
the
light
of
my
analysis
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
my
belief
that
in
relation
to
the
determinations
which
affect
the
execution,
directly
affect
the
execution
of
the
order,
my
belief
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
almost
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
court
in
giova.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
an
advocation
to
stay
deportation
and
the
often
correlative
application
to
reopen
the
proceeding
and
sometimes
they
go
together.
therefore,
i
think
in
my
opinion,
this
case
is
governed
by
giova
and
it
seems
to
me
that
reversal
of
the
court
below
is
warranted
on
that
ground
alone.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
it
was
just
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion
but
the
fact
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
dempsey
has
done
an
exceptionally
good
job.
i
think
his
brief
is
admirable.
but
i
think
that
giova
does
stand
for
something
taking
in
conjunction
with
foti
because
in
foti,
the
court
said,
“we
are
not
passing
on
the
motion
to
reopen
because
it
involves
a
different
issue
since
it
was
not
considered
in
the
same
proceeding
and
then
a
year
later,
per
curiam.”
and
the
foti
case
remembers
was
also
unanimous
per
curiam.
now,
upon
the
submission
of
the
government,
we
reverse
the
judgement
below
and
find
that
there
is
jurisdiction
and
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
the
petition.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
stand
for
something
and
the
fact
that
the
court
didn't
deem
that
there
was
a
very
significant
issue,
i
think
it
supports
our
view
of
this
case.
now,
we
ask
the
court
here
to
go
beyond
the
giova
situation.
we
think
the
case
is
governed
by
giova
but
we
would
like
if
the
court
would
for
the
court
to
consider
the
case
in
a
broader
setting
because
of
this
many
jurisdictional
dispute
that
have
come
up.
we
suggest
the
desirability
now
that
the
case
is
before
the
court
to
consider
some
of
these
other
issues
and
i
would
like
to
state
our
position
on
these
issues.
i've
already
stated
that
in
relation
to
motions,
to
determinations
which
bear
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
determinations
which
are
made
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
242
(b)
relates
only
to
the
determination
of
deportability.
there
is
a
companion
statute,
243
(a)
which
relates
to
the
execution
of
orders
entered
under
242
(b).
it
seems
to
us
that
these
two
statutes
and
their
implementing
regulations
are
in
pari
materia.
moreover,
it
seems
to
us
that
orders
relating
to
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order
are
in
a
very
real
sense
made
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
now,
for
reasons
developed
in
our
brief,
we
ask
the
court
also
to
consider
the
cases
of
antecedent
determinations
and
the
amicus
joins
with
us
here.
the
amicus
also
feels
that
this
hould
be
reviewable,
it
should
be
considered
part
of
the
final
deportation
order
and
reviewable
with
it
and
also
subsequent
determinations
of
the
kind,
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white,
those
which
don't
bear
directly
on
the
deportation
order
but
which
do
bear
indirectly
to
the
extent
that
if
granted,
they
would
vitiate
or
modify
the
deportation
order.
but
in
our
view,
it's
not
necessary
to
consider
these
questions.
so
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
now
is
the
--
a
determination
relating
directly
to
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order
and
we
submit
that
that
is
clearly
within
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
third
time
in
five
years,
this
court
is
asked
to
pass
on
the
statutory
provisions
for
the
review
of
deportation
orders.
its
first
two
decisions
in
1963
--
1965
--
1963
and
1964,
endorsed
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
today,
we
ask
the
court
to
go
a
step
further
and
to
hold
that
the
special
review
procedure
of
the
statute
is
applicable
to
the
denial
of
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
deportation.
now,
our
primary
concern
here
is
to
seek
an
interpretation
which
will
effectuate
the
statutory
intent
and
also
to
end
the
fruitless
jurisdictional
disputes
in
the
act
phrased
of
the
court
below
and
the
second
circuit
which
have
blocked
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
deportation
laws.
while
we
believe
that
the
substantive
portion
of
this
challenge
lacks
merit,
we're
not
arguing
the
merits
here.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
petitioner,
no
one
denies
that
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
judicial
review.
the
only
issue
is
whether
his
petition
should
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
a
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
this
depends
of
course
on
an
interpretation
of
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
admittedly,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unclear
but
its
major
purpose
is
unmistakable
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
foti.
the
dominant
goal
of
the
statute
and
i
quote,
“was
to
abbreviate
the
process
of
judicial
review
of
deportation
orders
in
order
to
frustrate
dilatory
attacks
in
the
courts.”
now,
the
court
went
on
to
say,
again
i
quote,
“the
key
feature
of
the
congressional
plan
aimed,
directed
at
this
problem
was
the
elimination
of
the
initial
first
step
in
the
obtaining
judicial
review,
a
suit
in
the
district
court.”
the
legislative
history
is
discussed
in
foti
and
in
our
view
it
abundantly
supports
the
court's
analysis.
now,
the
court
below
did
not
dispute
these
legislative
objectives.
however,
it
relied
on
this
court's
rulings
in
foti
and
giova
to
support
a
determination
that
since
motions
for
stay
of
deportation
were
addressed
to
a
district
director
rather
than
a
special
inquiry
officer,
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction.
now,
while
the
foti
opinion
did
emphasize
the
special
inquiry
officer's
role,
it
did
so,
i
believe,
in
addressing
the
specific
problem
before
the
court
in
that
case
which
was
an
effort
to
bifurcate
judicial
review
of
different
portions
of
the
special
inquiry
officer's
decision.
indeed,
in
reserving
the
question
which
was
later
decided
in
giova,
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
foti
stated,
relating
to
the
motion
to
reopen,
“the
question
is
admittedly
a
different
one
since
such
an
administrative
determination
is
not
made
during
the
same
proceeding
where
deportability
is
determined
and
discretionary
relief
is
denied.”
now,
in
the
light
of
that
reservation
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
not
unreasonable
to
read
the
holding
in
giova
as
sanctioning
at
least
some
review
of
ancillary
determinations.
now,
i
shall
not
attempt
to
debate
with
the
able
amicus
as
to
what
we
said
in
our
briefs
in
foti
and
giova.
since
then,
we
have
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
opinions
in
foti
and
giova
cases
and
also,
of
the
developing
litigation
thereafter
and
studying
the
statute
in
the
light
of
that
experience
and
in
the
context
of
actual
cases.
we
have
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
the
interpretation
for
which
we
argue
today
is
not
only
necessary
but
proper.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
narrow
reading
which
is
favored
by
the
court
below
is
not
only
artificially
literal
but
that
it
defeats
the
statutory
purpose
of
abbreviating
the
language
of
the
court
in
foti,
to
abbreviate
the
process
of
review
of
deportation
orders.
the
relevant
language
of
section
106
(a)
says
nothing
about
special
inquiry
officers.
those
officers
unquestionably
perform
an
important
function
in
the
deportation
process.
but
their
role
relates
to
only
one
segment
of
that
process.
total
responsibility
for
the
deportation
process
resides
in
the
attorney
general
under
whom
the
special
inquiry
officer
serves.
now
obviously,
the
court
below
would
not
deny
judicial
review
of
the
determinations
involved
here.
what
it
would
do
was
--
would
be
to
channel
them
into
the
district
court
to
hold
that
some
portions
of
the
deportation
process
are
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
other
portions
in
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me,
invites
the
very
type
of
bifurcation
of
review
which
court
deplored
in
foti.
moreover,
it
would
ignore
the
obvious
congressional
concern
with
challenges
to
the
deportation
order
after
the
basic
order
was
entered.
now,
that
concern
is
reviewed
--
is
shown
in
the
typical
cases
of
abuse
which
are
listed
in
the
committee
reports
and
which
were
referred
to
in
this
court's
opinion
in
foti.
now,
i
urge
the
desirability
of
reading
the
statute
in
a
manner
which
will
effectuate
the
purpose
that
congress
unquestionably
sought
to
achieve.
in
my
view,
the
statute
can
and
should
be
read
as
including
determinations
which
are
ancillary
to
and
would
directly
affect
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
which
is
against
this
has
conceded
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
such
an
interpretation
if
congress
is
found
to
have
intended
it.
now,
the
language
which
has
caused
the
difficulty
appears
in
two
phrases
of
the
statute.
the
first
is
the
statutory
reference
to
final
orders
of
deportation,
and
the
second
is
the
reference
to
such
orders
or
determinations
and
pursuant
--
this
is
the
language
in
the
statute,
“pursuant
to
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
(b)
of
this
act.”
in
foti,
this
court
rejected
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
first
raised,
final
order
of
deportation.
since
then,
some
of
the
courts
favoring
a
restrictive
interpretation
have
relied
on
the
second
phrase,
the
pursuant
phrase.
the
legislative
history
has
no
direct
evidence
of
the
purpose
the
congress
sought
to
achieve
by
this
second
phrase.
it
was
introduced
by
representative
walter
in
his
1958
bill
which
furnished
the
basis
on
which
the
law
was
finally
enacted.
it
really
was
substantially
the
final
law.
now,
representative
walter
didn't
explain
why
he
was
introducing
this
new
language.
but
my
own
belief
has
always
been
that
this
second
phrase
was
added
by
representative
walter
in
order
to
make
certain
that
the
new
review
procedure
that
he
proposed
would
not
be
applied
to
exclusion
proceedings.
throughout
the
legislative
consideration
of
this
measure,
there
are
repeated
statements
by
representative
walter,
by
other
members
of
congress
in
the
committee
reports
in
which
a
concern
is
expressed
for
a
limitation
of
the
type
of
judicial
review
that
will
be
available
in
relation
to
exclusion
proceedings.
section
106
(b)
of
the
statute
does
specifically
limit
such
review
to
habeas
corpus
in
exclusion
cases.
now,
representative
walter,
as
an
expert
in
this
field
was
aware
that
the
immigration
statute
in
referring
to
orders
of
exclusion
and
of
deportation
in
both
instances,
talks
of
aliens
being
deported.
and
it
is
my
belief,
admittedly
without
any
direct
evidence
that
when
representative
walter
added
the
second
phrase,
he
did
so
with
the
hope
that
he
would
avert
any
construction
of
the
statute
and
would
apply
it
to
the
review
of
exclusion
orders.
and
incidentally,
i
might
mention
that
some
enterprising
sole
has
actually
made
such
a
contention.
it
has
been
read
that
the
statute
applies
to
exclusion
orders,
that
contention
has
been
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
is
pending
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
part
of
our
submission.
we
think
it's
not
necessary
for
this
case.
we
believe
that
any
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
that's
clearly
within
the
statute
but
i
think
that
if
he
applies
to
the
district
director
for
an
order
which
will
make
him
unlawful
resident
of
united
states,
that
in
itself
will
initiate
the
deportation
order
and
itself
applies
to
the
deportation
order
and
should
be
reviewable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly
sir.
our
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
operates
directly
on
that
order.
it
may
cancel
it.
it
may
delay
it.
it
prevents
its
execution
and
we
think
that's
part
of
the
final
deportation
order
which
the
statute
speaks.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
connection
with
the
203
(a)
(7)
you're
talking
about.
mr.
charles
gordon
or
any
application
that
he
makes,
if
he
makes
an
application
for
what
we
call
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
charles
gordon
everything
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
adjustment
of
status
is
discretionary.
the
application
for
classification
made
to
some
extent
would
be
discretionary.
but
these
are
separate
discretionary
applications.
the
one
that
you
suggest
is
an
application
which
may
make
him
a
lawful,
permanent
resident
of
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
it
is
in
our
view
a
totally
meritless
ground
because
he
has
to
make
such
an
application
outside
united
states.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
an
application
of
that
kind
in
the
united
states.
that's
been
held
by
a
couple
of
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
has
been
denied
by
this
court.
now,
turning
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
of
course
we
have
to
rely
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
believe
a
reading
of
the
statute
--
the
reading
that
we
suggest
here
is
amply
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statue
considered
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
purpose.
the
statute
speaks
of
orders
made
pursuant
to
section
242
(b).
it
doesn't
say
in
section
242
(b)
proceedings.
it
doesn't
say
in
proceedings
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
says,
in
proceedings
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
now,
to
me,
that
language
necessarily
includes
an
order
of
the
type
here,
denying
an
application
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
that
determination
to
me
is
a
determination
pursuant
to
that
242
(b)
proceeding.
now,
to
treat
this
court
of
course
in
the
giova
case,
considered
a
very
similar
type
of
application,
an
application
for
reopening
the
proceedings.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
that
application
was
presented
four-and-a-half
years
after
the
basic
--
yet
the
court
in
giova,
found
that
that
type
of
application,
that
type
of
determination
since
it
bore
on
the
basic
order
and
since
it
affected
the
execution
of
the
order
was
reviewable
under
section
106
(a).
now,
a
motion
to
reopen
and
a
motion
for
a
stay
are
often
presented
together.
they
request
similar
relief.
both
of
them
seek
to
operate
on
the
deportation
order.
to
treat
these
two
types
of
applications
differently
because
under
present
regulations,
they
are
considered
by
different
officers,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
placing
emphasis
only
on
the
label
which
is
placed
on
the
application
because
our
experience
has
been
that
applications
of
the
very
type
that
is
under
consideration
here
sometimes
had
been
presented
in
the
form
of
motions
to
reopen
and
that
was
done
in
the
lee
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
sometimes
they
have
been
presented
in
the
form
of
motions
for
stay.
to
treat
them
differently
in
our
view
would
represent
a
triumph
of
form
of
a
substance.
now,
i
believe
the
essential
error
of
the
courts
which
have
favored
a
restrictive
interpretation
is
their
failure
to
view
the
entire
deportation
process
and
its
entirety
and
concentrating
only
on
one
aspect
of
it.
i
would
divide
and
i
have
in
the
brief
suggested
this
division.
i
would
divide
the
deportation
process
into
three
stages.
in
each
of
them
they're
on
the
final
deportation
order
and
on
the
proceedings
pursuant
to
section
242
(b).
the
first
is
what
i
have
called
ancillary
--
antecedent
determinations.
these
are
proceedings
or
determinations
leading
up
to
the
institutional
proceedings.
for
example,
a
person
may
be
here
in
the
united
states
temporarily
and
asked
for
an
extension
of
stay
and
that's
denied
or
he
may
be
here
as
an
exchange
visitor
who
has
to
leave.
he
seeks
a
waiver
which
would
permit
him
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states
or
he
seeks
a
visa
petition
which
would
enable
him
also
to
remain
permanently.
each
of
this
is
denied.
deportation
proceedings
are
commenced.
that's
the
first
stage,
the
antecedent
determination.
the
second
stage
in
which
i
would
classify
the
entire
process
is
what
i
call
integral
determinations.
these
are
determinations
within
the
actual
proceeding
itself,
the
hearing
proceeding.
foti
set
out
the
reviewability
of
all
determinations
made
in
the
integral
part
of
the
proceeding.
and
the
third
of
these
groupings
that
i've
made,
i
call
subsequent
determinations.
these
in
turn
can
be
divided
into
two
parts.
first,
would
be
determinations
bearing
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order;
and
second,
would
be
determinations
which
bear
on
the
order
less
directly
but
if
granted
would
vitiate
the
order
or
modify
its
effect.
in
the
light
of
this
complete
picture
of
the
process
in
all
of
its
stages,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
attempt
to
distinguish
this
court's
holding
in
giova
cannot
be
supported,
motions
to
reopen,
motions
for
a
stay
which
were
involved
in
giova
and
motions
for
a
stay
of
deportation
relate
equally
to
this
third
stage
of
the
deportation
process
subsequent
determinations,
moreover,
they
bear
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order.
indeed,
the
explicit
intent
of
congress
to
include
motions
to
stay
deportation
within
the
advent
of
section
106
(a)
is
revealed
in
a
chart
which
is
appended
to
the
committee
reports
in
which
we've
reproduced
as
appendix
b
of
our
brief,
page
55,
our
principal
brief.
now,
your
honors,
the
notes
said,
the
deportation
process
is
treated
in
various
stages
and
various
boxes
and
then
they
get
down
to
what
they
call
final
order
of
deportation
and
alongside
of
it,
there's
a
line,
stay
of
deportation.
in
other
words,
the
congressional
committees
which
drafted
this
law,
which
reported
on
it
in
their
reports
appended
this
chart
in
which
they
viewed
the
deportation
process
as
consisting
of
several
stages
and
at
the
end
of
it
on
the
same
line
as
the
final
order
of
deportation
as
an
adjunct
of
that
order,
they
list
the
stay
of
deportation.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
quite
that
easy
as
we've
suggested
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
let
me
answer
it
then.
i
agree
and
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
amicus
and
everybody
else
who
has
made
all
these
kind
of
suggestions
to
us
to
change
our
regulations.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
very
useful
if
we
could
get
everything
into
one
proceeding
because
then
you'd
have
one
review
and
it's
very
--
certainly
very
desirable
to
have
only
one
review
but
the
fact
is
that
you
can't
get
everything
into
one
proceeding.
you
can't
get
some
antecedent
determinations
into
the
same
proceeding
because
they
don't
relate
to
any
deportation
proceeding.
there's
no
deportation
proceeding
in
prospect
unless
the
application
is
denied.
why
put
the
man
to
a
deportation
proceeding.
as
to
subsequent
determinations,
it's
very
unlikely
that
you
can
get
most
of
them
into
the
deportation
proceeding.
you
could
say,
go
to
one
special
officer
but
that's
outside
the
proceeding
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
reservation
in
the
foti
case.
all
these
things
happen
after
the
deportation
order
is
entered.
for
example,
let's
take
the
mechanics
of
executing
the
deportation
order.
after
the
order
is
entered,
it
is
necessary
to
take
steps
and
it
becomes
final
if
necessary
to
take
steps
to
execute
it.
the
immigration
service
has
to
apply
to
foreign
governments
for
documents.
it
has
to
deal
with
transportation
lines.
now,
you
might
say,
“well,
what
kind
of
judicial
process
would
approach
this
type
of
determination?”
well,
this
is
not
a
fantasy
on
my
part.
we
have
here
before
the
court
a
case
on
which
a
deportee
who
has
gone
through
two
rounds
of
full
judicial
review
now
seeks
to
attack
in
the
district
court.
the
representations
he
alleges,
the
district
director
made
to
the
government
of
italy
in
executing
the
deportation
order.
so
you
see,
that
type
of
subsequent
determination
can't
go
into
the
deportation
proceeding.
now,
there
are
also
practical
considerations.
the
special
inquiry
officer
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
transportation
lines.
he
is
not
equipped
to
deal
with
foreign
governments.
circumstances
arise
years
later
as
was
shown
in
the
giova
case,
years
after
the
proceeding
is
completed,
a
new
law
is
passed
and
this
happens
all
the
time.
people
seek
--
are
really
fond
of
that
law.
a
man
marries
an
american
citizen
and
claims
benefits
as
a
result
of
that
status
or
a
new
--
an
american
citizen
child
is
born
to
him
and
he
claims
benefits.
so
all
these
things
come
up
later,
it's
impossible
to
join
them
into
the
state
proceeding.
it
might
be
possible
to
say
that
you
go
to
a
special
inquiry
officer
to
have
these
applications
considered.
but
to
us,
that
doesn't
alter
the
relationship
of
the
determination
and
the
process
to
the
essential
final
deportation
order.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
would
be
possible
but
--
mr.
charles
gordon
not
now,
nor
under
the
present
regulations.
we
have
amended
our
regulations.
we
gradually
have
tried
to
move
as
much
as
we
can
towards
the
unified
proceeding.
we
have
amended
our
regulations
to
give
the
special
inquiry
officer
authority
to
grant
a
stay
next
with
the
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
all.
well,
you
see,
most
practical
consideration
now
--
mr.
charles
gordon
district
directors
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
special
inquiry
officers
throughout
the
united
states
too
but
they're
no
always
in
the
place
where
the
stay
is
sought
at
the
last
minute.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
yes.
of
course
and
mechanics.
it
would
be
impossible
in
many
cases
to
consider
this.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
district
directors.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
district
directors
and
it
has
always
been
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
only
the
hearing
on
the
determination
of
deportability.
no
stay
of
deportation.
that
was
a
function
and
it's
still
a
function
of
the
district
director.
now,
i've
called
attention
to
this
chart
and
i
see
my
time
is
running
off.
we'll
pass
the
chart
if
we
could
discuss
that
now.
now,
i
think
in
the
light
of
my
analysis
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
my
belief
that
in
relation
to
the
determinations
which
affect
the
execution,
directly
affect
the
execution
of
the
order,
my
belief
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
almost
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
court
in
giova.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
an
advocation
to
stay
deportation
and
the
often
correlative
application
to
reopen
the
proceeding
and
sometimes
they
go
together.
therefore,
i
think
in
my
opinion,
this
case
is
governed
by
giova
and
it
seems
to
me
that
reversal
of
the
court
below
is
warranted
on
that
ground
alone.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
it
was
just
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion
but
the
fact
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
dempsey
has
done
an
exceptionally
good
job.
i
think
his
brief
is
admirable.
but
i
think
that
giova
does
stand
for
something
taking
in
conjunction
with
foti
because
in
foti,
the
court
said,
“we
are
not
passing
on
the
motion
to
reopen
because
it
involves
a
different
issue
since
it
was
not
considered
in
the
same
proceeding
and
then
a
year
later,
per
curiam.”
and
the
foti
case
remembers
was
also
unanimous
per
curiam.
now,
upon
the
submission
of
the
government,
we
reverse
the
judgement
below
and
find
that
there
is
jurisdiction
and
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
the
petition.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
stand
for
something
and
the
fact
that
the
court
didn't
deem
that
there
was
a
very
significant
issue,
i
think
it
supports
our
view
of
this
case.
now,
we
ask
the
court
here
to
go
beyond
the
giova
situation.
we
think
the
case
is
governed
by
giova
but
we
would
like
if
the
court
would
for
the
court
to
consider
the
case
in
a
broader
setting
because
of
this
many
jurisdictional
dispute
that
have
come
up.
we
suggest
the
desirability
now
that
the
case
is
before
the
court
to
consider
some
of
these
other
issues
and
i
would
like
to
state
our
position
on
these
issues.
i've
already
stated
that
in
relation
to
motions,
to
determinations
which
bear
directly
on
the
execution
of
the
order.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
determinations
which
are
made
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
242
(b)
relates
only
to
the
determination
of
deportability.
there
is
a
companion
statute,
243
(a)
which
relates
to
the
execution
of
orders
entered
under
242
(b).
it
seems
to
us
that
these
two
statutes
and
their
implementing
regulations
are
in
pari
materia.
moreover,
it
seems
to
us
that
orders
relating
to
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order
are
in
a
very
real
sense
made
pursuant
to
proceedings
under
section
242
(b).
now,
for
reasons
developed
in
our
brief,
we
ask
the
court
also
to
consider
the
cases
of
antecedent
determinations
and
the
amicus
joins
with
us
here.
the
amicus
also
feels
that
this
hould
be
reviewable,
it
should
be
considered
part
of
the
final
deportation
order
and
reviewable
with
it
and
also
subsequent
determinations
of
the
kind,
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white,
those
which
don't
bear
directly
on
the
deportation
order
but
which
do
bear
indirectly
to
the
extent
that
if
granted,
they
would
vitiate
or
modify
the
deportation
order.
but
in
our
view,
it's
not
necessary
to
consider
these
questions.
so
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
now
is
the
--
a
determination
relating
directly
to
the
execution
of
the
deportation
order
and
we
submit
that
that
is
clearly
within
the
statute.
thank
you.
