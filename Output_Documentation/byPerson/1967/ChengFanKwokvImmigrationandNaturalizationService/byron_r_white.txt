justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
filed
a
motion
or
petition,
whatever
you
do,
under
section
203
(a)
(7)
to
be
determined
to
be
a
refugee?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
that
were
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
have
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
suppose
that
if
this
alien
had
applied
for
reclassification
as
a
refugee
to
the
district
director
and
the
district
director
had
determined
that
he
was
not
so
classifiable,
that
that
would
be
reviewable
to
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
if
he
applied
to
the
district
director
and
he
also
said,
now
you
suspend
the
order
of
deportation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
if
he
--
and
a
fortiori
then
if
the
district
director
refuses
in
order
to
--
a
petition
to
delay
the
order
of
deportation
pending
his
determination
of
reclassification,
that
affects
the
--
directly
the
deportation
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
affect
it
but
it
might.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
really
is
in
the
--
you
really
have
to
argue
the
203
(a)
(7)
determinations
would
be
reviewable
because
if
he
refuses
to
suspend
the
order
of
deportation,
he
hasn't
affected
it
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
really
hinges
on
203
(a)
(7).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
discretionary
relief
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
happens
to
be
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
he
asked
for
suspension.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
ordered
this
deportation
have
granted
a
stay
pending
an
application
under
203(a)(7)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
he
have
the
power
to
grant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
can
order
the
--
who
can
order
the
deportation
stay
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
situation
--
that's
just
a
matter
of
regulation
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
situation
when
a
congress
put
this
box
in
here
in
connection
with
the
claimed
orders
of
deportation
stays?
who
could
issue
a
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
they
made
this
chart,
special
inquiry
officers
could
not
grant
stays
that
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
think
of
any
order
to
be
made
pursuant
to
a
242
proceeding
which
would
not
be
made
by
the
special
inquiry
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
special
inquiry
officers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--can
issue
orders
that
are
revealed
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
district
director
simply
issues
a
stay
of
the
deportation
order
on
some
good
ground,
pending
some
other
determination
that
even
though
it
wholly
suspends
the
deportation
order
and
that
order
is
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
is
a
matter
that's
pursuant
to
a
242
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
isn't
the
subject
matter
--
isn't
the
subject
matter
is
the
person
that
was
issuing
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
had
some
problems
like
that
in
other
areas,
which
doesn't
seem
to
have
prevented
remanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
contract
to
appeals
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
had
filed
a
motion
or
petition,
whatever
you
do,
under
section
203
(a)
(7)
to
be
determined
to
be
a
refugee?
justice
byron
r.

what
if
that
were
denied?
justice
byron

white
well,
did
you
have
an

to
the

of

justice

would
you

that

now
you
suspend

and
but
if
he

and
a

then
if
the

refuses
in

to

and
that's

well,
who
can
order
the
--
who
can
order
the
deportation
stay
then?
justice

now,
what
