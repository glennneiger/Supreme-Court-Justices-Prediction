i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
when
you
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate,
that
the
policeman
didn't
have
the
concern
for
his
own
personal
safety,
because
i
thought
he
said
that,
based
on
his
intuition,
he
thought
these
people
were
casing
the
place
in
order
to
rob
it.
isn't
that
what
he
said?

well
presumably,
then,
he
would
be
armed;
and
the
minute
he
walked
up
to
talk
to
them,
he
would
quite
reasonably
be
concerned
for
his
own
personal
safety,
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
much
was
in
the
record,
that
he
thought,
whether
with,
or
without,
reasonable
cause,
he
thought
or
suspected
that
these
were
armed
robbers
about
ready
to
hold
up
a
place.
i
suppose
if
you
walk
up
to
such
people,
and
begin
asking
them
embarrassing
questions,
you
might
have
some
little
concern
for
your
safety
if
you
bonafide
believe
that
they
have
weapons
on
them.
now
that
much
is
in
the
