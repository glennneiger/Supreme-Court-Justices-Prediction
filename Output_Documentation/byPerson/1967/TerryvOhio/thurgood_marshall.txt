justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
payne,
in
this
case
this
arresting
officer
testified,
did
he
not,
that
he
had
never
seen
anybody
for
a
case
a
joint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
also
testified
that
he
had
been
on
that
same
area
for
some
thirty
years,
doing
the
following
things:
checking
for
pick-pockets,
and
shoplifters?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
where
did
he
get
his
expertise
about
somebody
about
to
commit
a
robbery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
we're
getting
intuition
by
osmosis?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
exceptions
to
this.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
seriously,
mr.
payne,
the
point
is
that
the
only
thing
he
noticed
was:
a
man
leaves
from
a
position
of
talking
to
another
man
and
goes
across
the
street,
looks
in
a
window,
and
goes
back.
now,
number
one,
you
will
agree
that
everybody
who
looks
in
a
public
window
is
not
casing
the
joint
agreement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
did
it
twice,
or
three
times.
how
many
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
too
clear
to
me
from
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they
beared
watching,
you
would
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
beared
watching?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
your
own
court
say
they
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest,
as
of
this
point
we
are
now
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
--
well,
we
haven't
frisked
him
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest,
when
he
approached.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
didn't
get
probable
cause
until
he
put
his
hands
on
the
butt
of
the
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
him
until
he
put
his
hands
on
the
butt
of
the
gun,
in
his
inside
coat
pocket.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
he
get
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
have
it,
as
counsel
for
petitioner
says,
he
didn't
have
it
when
he
laid
hands
on
him
and
turned
him
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
say
he
saw
the
gun
bulging,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
payne,
couldn't
you
say
that
when
he
laid
hands
on
him
and
swung
him
around
that
petitioner's
freedom
of
movement
was
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
not
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
because
he
only
turned
him
around?
it
didn't
take
long
to
turn
him
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
particular
case
he
laid
hands
on
him,
and
swung
him
around.
how
many
days
later
was
payne
free
to
go,
from
that
moment
on,
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
in
this
particular
case,
when
did
he
next
get
out?
when
did
terry
get
his
freedom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
his
freedom
was
arrested,
for
quite
a
while.
justice
thurgood

mr.

in

this
