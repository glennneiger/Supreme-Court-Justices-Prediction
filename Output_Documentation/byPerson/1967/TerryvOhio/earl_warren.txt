mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stokes,
i
wonder
if
that
could
be
broken
down
a
little?
i
wonder
what
you
would
say
to
this,
of
course
the
police
officer
does
have
the
right
to
investigate
a
crime;
and
this
police
officer,
in
this
instance,
had
the
right
to
investigate
the
crime.
he
did
see
what
one
might
well
say
were
suspicious
acts
on
the
part
of
the
people
whom
he
thought
might
be
preparing
to
commit
a
crime.
he
had
a
right,
did
he
not,
to
pursue
that
farther
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
would
have
probable
cause,
perhaps,
for
an
arrest?
pursuant
to
that,
he
went
to
talk
to
these
men.
now,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
he
suspected,
a
robbery,
he
felt
that
when
he
went
into
the
company
of
these
three
men,
against
himself
alone,
that
he
was
in
a
dangerous
position;
and,
that,
therefore,
he
had
probable
cause
to
see
if
they
had
weapons
on
them,
not
because
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
they
had
committed
a
crime,
but
because
in
investigative
matters
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
his
life
was
in
danger.
under
those
circumstances,
would
you
think
that
he
did,
or
did
not
have
a
right
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
in
a
position
of
danger,
by
seeing
if
they
had
weapons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
police
officers
are
very
often
in
a
position
where
they
might
not
be
able
to
make
an
actual
arrest,
but
they
are
in
a
position
of
great
danger.
now,
where
they
are
in
a
position
of
great
danger,
are
they
in
a
position
to
protect
themselves
from
violence,
by
looking
into
the
situation
to
see
if
anyone
is
armed
to
do
the
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
a
situation
of
this
kind,
where
a
police
officer
sees
someone
acting
very
peculiarly.
it
might
not
be
in
connection
with
any
information
he
has
about
any
crime.
maybe
the
person
is
abnormal,
mentally.
maybe
he
thinks
he's
insane
and
he
wants
to
talk
to
him.
but
the
man
shows
indications
of,
he
thinks,
of
violence
and
he
wants
to
be
sure
he
won't
be
attacked
when
he
goes
to
talk
to
him.
he
goes
up
to
speak
to
him,
and
also
ascertains
whether
he
has
any
weapon
on
him.
do
you
think
he
had
a
right
to
do
that,
as
a
matter
of
probable
cause
that
he
might
be
injured
himself
if
he
doesn't
take
precautions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
arguing
with
you.
i'm
just
seeing
how
far
we
have
to
go
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
that's
the
only
reason
for
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
payne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
colloquy
at
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
the
arrest
take
place?
just
speaking
in
ordinary
terms,
now,
not
little
arrest,
or
big
arrest,
but
speaking
in
ordinary
terms,
when
was
he
arrested?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
three
more
minutes
to
finish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
had
expired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
would
just
ask
the
court
to
consider
that,
on
the
state
of
the
record,
this
police
officer
is
acting
upon
the
suspicion
he
has
that
these
two
men
are
casing
a
place;
that
the
stores
where
they
are
supposedly
casing,
are
located
on
huron
avenue
at
fourteenth
street
at
the
apex.
these
men
have
gone
down
euclid
avenue,
where
huron
avenue
cannot
even
be
seen.
they
are
standing
in
front
of
a
store
there
that
has
not,
on
the
state
of
this
record,
been
cased
at
the
time
that
they
are
approached
and
subjected
to
the
arrest.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
be
mindful,
also,
of
the
fact
that
if
this
court
does
affirm
this
decision,
it
will,
in
effect,
be
affirming
the
decision
rendered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
in
which
they
have
established
the
fruit-of-the-frisk
doctrine
for
the
state
of
ohio.
i
would
ask
you
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
state
of
ohio's
legislature
has
just
considered,
a
few
months
ago,
and
rejected
a
stop-and-frisk
bill
similar
to
that
of
the
state
of
new
york.
lastly,
we
would
ask
you
to
consider
that
in
accordance
with
decisions
such
as
deray,
where
this
court
has
said
a
search
is
either
good
or
bad
when
it
starts,
and
it
does
not
change
character
thereafter;
and,
that
the
after-the-event
justification
does
not
relate
back
to
justify
the
original,
initial
unlawful
search.
thank
you.
