mr.

stokes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
state
versus
terry
comes
to
this
court
by
virtue
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court.
this
case
originally
arose
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
cuyahoga
county,
based
upon
the
indictment
for
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
in
violation
of
ohio
revised
code,
section
2923.01.
the
defendant
in
this
case
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence,
and
at
the
trial
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion.
after
hearing
the
motion,
the
motion
was
overruled
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
this
was
a
bench
trial,
jury
having
been
waived.
after
hearing
the
evidence,
the
motion
originally
filed
was
overruled
again.
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
the
trial
court
ruled
an
opinion
in
this
case,
and
we
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
cuyahoga
county.
this
court
sustained
and
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
lower
court.
this
court
also
wrote
an
opinion.
subsequently,
application
was
made
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
for
review,
and
that
court
dismissed
the
application
for
review
stating:
no
debatable
constitutional
question.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these
and
i
think
they
are
signally
important,
if
we
are
to
try
to
arrive
at
the
proper
verdict,
with
reference
to
this
case.
this
incident
occurred
at
2:30
in
the
afternoon,
in
broad
daylight
in
the
downtown
section
of
cleveland,
ohio.
the
police
officer
in
this
case,
one
martin
mcfadden,
noticed
two
negro
males
standing
at
the
corner
of
fourteenth
street,
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
where
euclid
avenue
and
huron
road
intersect.
these
two
streets,
if
the
court
please,
form
a
triangle
at
the
apex
of
east
fourteenth
street
--
the
police
officer
was
approximately
100
feet
away
from
where
these
two
men
were.
he
positioned
himself
--
mr.
louis
stokes
that
is
our
downtown
section,
a
business
section
of
the
city,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
was
that
there
was
business
as
usual
in
the
downtown
center
of
the
city;
stores
were
open
and
there
were
pedestrians
on
the
street.
mr.
louis
stokes
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
louis
stokes
on
a
weekday.
the
police
officer
stated
that
he
positioned
himself
in
the
doorway
of
a
department
store
by
the
name
of
rogauffs.
for
a
period
of
10
to
12
minutes,
he
observed
these
two
males
at
the
corner.
alternately,
each
made
five
or
six
trips
over
to
two
stores
located
on
huron
road.
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
the
united
airlines
store,
or
the
diamond
store,
but
the
stores
were
immediately
adjacent
to
one
another
on
huron
street.
during
these
five
trips
that
they
made
during
the
10
or
12
minute
period,
a
third
male
came
by,
white
male
who
stood
and
talked
with
the
two
males
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
the
other
male
proceeded
west,
on
euclid
avenue,
and
the
two
males
continued
on
this
corner.
after
the
10
to
12
minute
period,
the
two
men
then
walked
west
on
euclid
avenue,
some
several
hundred
feet
down
euclid
avenue.
when
they
arrived
at
zucker's
store,
which
is
in
the
vicinity
of
9th
street,
or
11th
street,
there
on
euclid
avenue,
the
three
males
then
again
met
up,
at
which
time
the
three
of
them,
according
to
the
police
officer's
testimony,
merely
standing
in
front
of
zucker's
store
--
mr.
louis
stokes
zucker's
is
a
haberdashery,
your
honor.
his
testimony
was
that
their
backs
were
to
the
plate
glass
windows.
they
were
facing
the
street,
and
when
interrogated
with
reference
to
what
they
were
doing,
he
said
they
were
merely
standing
there
talking.
he
described
their
gate
away
from
fourteenth
street
as
they
walked
down
to
the
haberdashery
as
a
normal
walk,
nothing
unusual
about
it.
the
police
officer
then
says,
i
then
went
over
to
the
three
men.
i
said
to
them,
i'm
a
police
officer.
what
are
your
names?
in
the
first
instance,
he
said,
they
gave
it
to
me
quick.
in
all
other
places
in
the
record,
he
says,
they
mumbled
something.
he
said,
at
this,
i
then
reached
out
and
got
terry.
i
spun
him
around,
holding
him
in
front
of
me.
i
then
began
to
pat
him
down.
once
he
had
patted,
patted
this
man
down,
he
says:
i
felt
inside
of
his
top
coat
what
felt
to
be
the
handle
of
a
gun.
i
then
reached
inside
the
coat
and
tried
to
remove
the
gun.
i
could
not
remove
the
gun.
i
therefore
took
the
entire
coat
off
of
him
and
then
took
the
gun
out
of
the
coat.
at
this
point,
he
says,
i
ordered
the
three
of
them
into
the
store.
as
i
walked
through
the
doorway,
i
said
to
the
store
personnel,
â€˜order
the
wagon.
he
later
explained
that
ordering
the
wagon
means
you
are
then
under
arrest.
once
inside
the
store,
the
three
men
were
ordered
up
against
the
wall,
whereupon
he
then
searched
chilton.
inside
of
chilton's
top
coat,
he
also
found
a
loaded
revolver.
he
searched
the
third
male,
katz,
upon
whom
he
found
nothing.
he
then
calls
these
men
to
be
removed
from
the
haberdashery
to
the
cleveland's
police
station.
when
they
arrived
at
the
police
station,
they
were
then
booked
for
investigation.
some
time
late
the
next
day,
after
having
been
interrogated
the
following
morning,
these
men
were
then
charged,
officially
late
the
second
day,
with
carrying
concealed
weapons.
the
police
officer
testified
further
with
reference
to
questions
propounded
to
him
having
to
bear
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
we
asked
him,
did
you
know
any
of
these
men?
no.
had
you
ever
seen
any
of
these
men
previously?
had
anyone
given
you
any
information
regarding
them?
he
was
then
asked
what
had
attracted
his
attention
to
them.
he
said,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
didn't
like
them.
and
i
was
attracted
to
their
actions
up
there
on
fourteenth
street.
mr.
louis
stokes
in
the
record
--
mr.
louis
stokes
he
said,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
didn't
like
them.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
then,
he
said
further,
mr.
justice,
that,
i
was
attracted
to
their
actions
there
at
fourteenth
street.
this
officer
testified
further,
though,
that
he
felt
that
they
might
be
casing
the
place
for
a
stick-up.
we
then
--
the
court
then
inquired
of
him
specifically
if
he
had
ever,
and
by
the
way,
this
police
officer
had
been
a
police
officer
for
39
years,
and
a
detective
for
35
years.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
was
in
plain
clothes,
your
honor.
the
court
specifically
asked
him
if
he
had,
during
his
39
years
as
a
police
officer
ever
previously
observed
any
one
casing
a
place.
he
said,
no,
he
had
not.
asked
if
he
had
arrested
anyone
for
casing
a
place,
in
his
39
years,
he
said
that
he
had
not.
we
should
like
to
make
reference,
just
briefly
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
matter.
our
court
held,
in
that
opinion,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
warrant
had
been
issued
for
a
search
or
frisk,
and
i
am
not
going
to
stress
the
facts
and
state
that
there
was
a
lawful
arrest
prior
to
the
frisk
of
the
defendants.
i
believe
it
would
be
stretching
the
facts
beyond
reasonable
comprehension,
and
foolhardy,
to
say
there
was
an
unlawful
arrest
because
there
wasn't
from
the
facts
as
presented.
later,
in
the
same
opinion,
our
trial
court
said,
i
believe,
and
i
reiterate
again,
that
search
and
seizure
laws
cannot
be
applied
to
this
particular
situation,
although
mr.
reuben
payne
endeavored
to
show
there
was
a
lawful
arrest.
but
the
court
cannot
agree.
if
there
was
an
arrest,
it
came
subsequent
to
the
frisk.
the
court
then
based
its
decision
upon
ker
versus
california.
the
court
said
that
the
ker
decision
did
not
preclude
the
states
from
developing
workable
rules
in
order
to
bring
about
effective
law
enforcement
in
the
states.
the
court
said,
with
reference
to
the
acquisition
of
the
gun,
that
the
gun
was
the
fruit
of
the
frisk
and
that
probable
cause
arose
once
the
police
officer
had
frisked,
found
the
gun;
he
then
had
the
probable
cause
to
arrest.
our
court
of
appeals,
in
affirming
the
decision,
stated
that,
a
policeman
may,
under
appropriate
circumstances,
reasonably
inquire
of
a
person
concerning
his
suspicious
on-the-street
behavior,
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest.
our
court
admitted
that
in
all
probability
this
would
lead
to
abuses
by
the
police,
but
then
went
on
to
say
that,
the
court
would
deal
with
the
abuses
as
they
arose
before
the
court.
the
court
stated,
further,
that
this
of
course
was
just
a
minor
inconvenience
with
the
personal
liberty
that
is
guaranteed,
and
that
therefore
each
citizen
ought
to
be
willing
to
give
up
this
amount
of
his
personal
liberty
in
order
that
they
might
have
effective
law
enforcement
in
the
community.
our
court
offered
this
definition
of
arrest,
that
as
the
term
is
used
in
criminal
law,
it
signifies
the
apprehension
or
detention
of
the
person
of
another
in
order
that
he
may
be
forthcoming
to
answer
an
alleged
or
supposed
crime.
they
distinguished
henry
versus
u.s.
by
saying
that
in
that
case
the
government
had
made
a
concession,
and
therefore
when
this
court
rendered
henry
that
it
was
rendering
it
on
the
unique
situation
where
the
government
had
come
in
and
conceded
that
at
the
time
the
automobile
was
stopped,
the
arrest
had
occurred.
they,
therefore,
said
this
court
had
not,
in
that
case,
rendered
an
independent
view
of
the
facts;
and,
in
fact
held
that
this
was
an
arrest
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
we're
saying
that
and
we're
saying
in
addition
to
that,
this
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that,
at
the
point
this
police
officer
approached
these
men,
and
at
the
point
he
lay
his
hands
on
the
citizen,
that
he
had
--
he
did
not
have
the
probable
cause
that
is
required
--
he
has
stated
that
all
he
had,
at
that
point,
was
this
intuitive
sixth
sense,
and
that
he
had
never
in
his
long
experience
as
a
police
officer
ever
arrested
anyone
for
this
purpose.
mr.
louis
stokes
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
whatsoever,
and
we
might
add--
mr.
louis
stokes
this
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
stokes
this
is
what
he
said.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
correctly,
i
understood
him
to
say,
was
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicated
he
had
any
reason
to
be
concerned
with
his
own
personal
safety?
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
he
says,
after
he
says
he
thought
they
might
be
casing
the
place
--
and
i
felt
that
they
might
have
guns.
he
did
say
that.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
he
did.
but
in
our,
both
our
lower
court
and
in
our
appellate
court,
in
stating
that
a
police
officer
should
inquire
promptly
into
suspicious
on-the-street
activity,
we
brought
out
the
fact,
and
the
record
will
show,
that
there
was
no
interrogation,
there
was
no
investigation
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
the
officer
approaching.
now
the
court
has
said
that
he
had
the
right
to
approach,
to
investigate,
and
to
interrogate.
but
the
only
question
in
the
record
is,
what
are
your
names?
at
which
point,
he
then
grabbed
terry,
spun
him
around,
and
began
his
search.
during
the
interim
period
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
other
police
to
arrive,
there
was
no
conversation
between
the
police
officers
--
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
properly,
mr.
justice,
you
do
preface
it
by
saying
if
there
is
enough?
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
there
was
enough,
if
the
constitutional
criteria
had
been
met,
i
would
say,
yes,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
where
one
makes
a
valid
arrest--
mr.
louis
stokes
no,
i
say
if
he
wanted
to,
he
had
the
right
to
ask
them
a
question.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
we
are
to
say,
first,
that
he
has
a
right
to
question,
i
am
saying
that
he
can
exercise
a
discretion
if
he
chooses.
i
am
not
saying
that,
at
that
point,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
question
them.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
i
am
saying
that,
mr.
justice.
i
am
saying
that
where
a
citizen
is
on
the
streets,
and
where
all
of
the
criteria
that
we
know
of
by
way
of
the
development
of
probable
cause
is
absent,
in
that
situation--
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
we
are
going
to
use
the
absolute
term
no
right,
and
we're
to
be
held
to
that,
then
i
would
just
have
to
say
he
has
no
right.
it
seems
to
me
he
wants
to
exercise
some
discretion
on
his
part,
of
walking
up
and
posing
a
question,
asking
a
name,
asking
an
address,
this
is
a
right
he
has.
by
the
same
token
that
the
person
whose
liberty
is
being
invaded,
the
person
who
has
committed
no
overt
wrong,
and
the
person
who
is
only
a
suspect,
at
that
point--
mr.
louis
stokes
no.
he
had
done
nothing
outside
of
what
a
policeman
might
ordinarily
do.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
would
say
that
under
the
circumstances
presented
to
me,
that
he
did
not
under
those
circumstances
have
the
right
to
lay
hands
on
this
citizen
and
spin
him
around.
mr.
louis
stokes
no
that
he
didn't
have
--
i
am
saying
that
at
the
point
that
you
lay
the
hand
on
the
citizen,
and
you
begin
to
exercise
dominion
over
that
citizen
on
the
street
by
spinning
him
around,
i
am
saying,
in
order
for
you
to
do
this
you
must
have
the
probable
cause
that
is
required
to
place
a
person
under
arrest,
because
if
the
person
is
substantially
under
your
custody,
your
dominion--
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
mr.
louis
stokes
a
period
of
ten
to
twelve
minutes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us,
and
of
course
our
position
is
in
this
case
that
the
mapp
exclusionary
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
to
this
situation.
we're
not
here
advocating
any
change
with
reference
to
the
fourth
amendment.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state
is
in
a
position
of
saying
to
the
court
that
they
are
not
satisfied
with
the
mapp
exclusionary
rule.
as
we
read
the
rule
as
we
read
mapp,
we
don't
see
where
the
court
carved
out
any
exception
with
relation
to
a
gun.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
said
that
any
arrest
based
upon
anything
other
than
a
probable
cause
is
an
unreasonable
arrest,
and
that
all
of
the
evidence
must
be
excluded.
we
think
that
the
deterrent
that
mapp
affords
us
with
respect
to
illegal
searches
and
seizures
is
something
that
we
are
willing
to
continue
living
with.
although
terry
is
before
you,
we
think
it
goes
much
farther
than
this.
we
think
that
when
the
state
is
saying
that
there
is
something
called
reasonably
suspects,
reasonable
suspicion,
as
it
is
put
in
some
jurisdictions,
and
they're
asking
this
court
to
relax
the
fourth
amendment,
as
it
is
known,
they
are
in
effect
asking
this
court
to
nullify
the
fourth
amendment
and
to
overrule
mapp
versus
ohio.
we
think,
therefore,
that
if
this
is
to
prevail,
that
it
is
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
persuade
this
court
that
this
court
has
some
where
in
history
permitted
something
other
than
probable
cause
to
determine
whether
an
arrest
and
a
search
and
seizure
is
probable,
or
one
that
is
impermissible.
some
of
the
jurisdictions--
mr.
louis
stokes
only
if
we're
going
to
relax
the
standard
of
probable
cause,
as
we
know
it,
under
the
fourth
amendment.
he
didn't
permit
the
situation
to
ripen
into
the
point
where
it
had
ripened
into
a
probable-cause-type
of
a
situation.
he
was
a
little
ahead
of
himself,
in
this
situation,
and
our
position
would
have
to
be
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to
protect
a
constitutionally
impermissible
arrest;
and,
consequently,
this
is
the
way
we
would
have
to
answer
it.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
certainly
has
a
right
of
self-defense,
and
he
has
a
right
to
protect
himself.
but
the
product,
once
it
has
been
removed,
the
danger
has
been
removed;
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case,
since
it
was
not
based
upon
probable
cause,
we
should
not
protect
the
constitutionally
impermissible
arrest,
by
permitting
the
yield
of
that
arrest
to
come
into
evidence
against
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
think
we
are
faced
with
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
average
police
officer
would
do
this
under
these
circumstances.
if
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
any
type
of
danger
that
he
would
conduct
a
search,
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
own
life
in
a
possibly
dangerous
situation.
but
i
am
saying
that
we
cannot
merely
because
of
that
type
of
situation,
and
not
being
what
is
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
we
can't
give
sanctity
to
it
by
way
of
saying,
since
you
did
find
this
product,
we're
going
to
permit
it
into
the
evidence.
mr.
louis
stokes
certainly,
your
honor.
another
reason
we
think
that
the
court
--
another
thing
that
i
think
the
court
has
to
take
into
consideration
here,
of
course,
is
the
impossibility
that
this
court
has
of
standardizing
such
a
subjective
thing
as
intuition.
all
the
amicus
briefs
say,
permit
us
this
standard
that
is
less
than
probable
cause;
permit
us
to
stop
and
frisk
people
on
the
streets.
now
experience
has
already
taught
us,
if
the
court
please,
that
policemen
have
had
enough
difficulty
being
able
to
grapple
with
and
to
determine
for
themselves
what
is
tantamount
to
probable
cause,
as
it
has
been
enunciated
in
the
decisions
by
this
court.
now
they're
saying
to
this
court,
give
us
another
standard.
give
us
this,
reasonably
suspects,
or
based
upon
suspicion,
or
whatever
the
standard
is
that's
less
than
probable
cause.
we
think
that
we're
just
compounding
the
policeman's
problems
if
the
court
does
permit
this
type
of
a
thing
to
occur.
with
reference
to
the
basic
guarantee
that
we
are
concerned
about
here,
i
don't
think
we
are
so
much
concerned,
really,
about
terry,
because
over
the
years
it
has
been
the
person
who
has
been
involved
in
criminal
activity
that
has
come
before
this
court
in
order
for
this
court
to
again
take
a
look
at
some
of
our
basic
constitutional
guarantees.
i
think,
through
terry,
that
we
look
at
the
hundreds
of
people
walking
the
street
by
the
day
because
police
officers,
or
a
police
officer,
finds
himself
observing
a
situation
where
he
says,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
just
didn't
like
them
and
then
i
began
watching
them.
then
the
fact
that
he
wants
to
go
further,
and
at
that
point,
i
think
we're
subjecting
all
of
the
people
who
have
this
inviolate
right
of
privacy,
to
this
type
of
activity
on
the
public
streets
throughout
our
nation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
can't
take
it
that
far.
mr.
louis
stokes
i'm
saying
that
where
the
police
officer
chooses,
with
reference
to
whatever
his
determination
has
been,
to
interrogate
or
to
investigate
further
with
respect
to
citizens
lawfully
on
the
street,
that
in
order
to
exercise
dominion
or
custody
or
control
over
that
citizen,
and
thereby
deprive
him
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
he
must
have
before
approaching
him
that
probable
cause
which
this
court
has
made
reference
to
in
its
decisions.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
has
the
right
to
approach
him
and
ask
his
questions.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
this
person
having
committed
any
crime
of
any
sort,
and
where
the
approach
is
based
on
suspicion
alone,
the
person
being
subjected
to
the
interrogation
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer,
or
to
turn
away.
mr.
louis
stokes
mr.
justice,
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
giving
you
the
impression
that
a
police
officer
cannot
ask
him
a
question.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
can
arrest
him,
if
he
chooses.
mr.
louis
stokes
then
i
don't
think
he
has
that
right.
mr.
louis
stokes
that
is
precisely
what
i'm
saying,
because
otherwise
the
fourth's
--
inviolate
right
of
privacy
is
being
invaded.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you.
mr.
louis
stokes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
state
versus
terry
comes
to
this
court
by
virtue
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court.
this
case
originally
arose
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
cuyahoga
county,
based
upon
the
indictment
for
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
in
violation
of
ohio
revised
code,
section
2923.01.
the
defendant
in
this
case
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence,
and
at
the
trial
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion.
after
hearing
the
motion,
the
motion
was
overruled
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
this
was
a
bench
trial,
jury
having
been
waived.
after
hearing
the
evidence,
the
motion
originally
filed
was
overruled
again.
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
the
trial
court
ruled
an
opinion
in
this
case,
and
we
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
cuyahoga
county.
this
court
sustained
and
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
lower
court.
this
court
also
wrote
an
opinion.
subsequently,
application
was
made
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
for
review,
and
that
court
dismissed
the
application
for
review
stating:
no
debatable
constitutional
question.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these
and
i
think
they
are
signally
important,
if
we
are
to
try
to
arrive
at
the
proper
verdict,
with
reference
to
this
case.
this
incident
occurred
at
2:30
in
the
afternoon,
in
broad
daylight
in
the
downtown
section
of
cleveland,
ohio.
the
police
officer
in
this
case,
one
martin
mcfadden,
noticed
two
negro
males
standing
at
the
corner
of
fourteenth
street,
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
where
euclid
avenue
and
huron
road
intersect.
these
two
streets,
if
the
court
please,
form
a
triangle
at
the
apex
of
east
fourteenth
street
--
the
police
officer
was
approximately
100
feet
away
from
where
these
two
men
were.
he
positioned
himself
--
mr.
louis
stokes
that
is
our
downtown
section,
a
business
section
of
the
city,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
was
that
there
was
business
as
usual
in
the
downtown
center
of
the
city;
stores
were
open
and
there
were
pedestrians
on
the
street.
mr.
louis
stokes
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
louis
stokes
on
a
weekday.
the
police
officer
stated
that
he
positioned
himself
in
the
doorway
of
a
department
store
by
the
name
of
rogauffs.
for
a
period
of
10
to
12
minutes,
he
observed
these
two
males
at
the
corner.
alternately,
each
made
five
or
six
trips
over
to
two
stores
located
on
huron
road.
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
the
united
airlines
store,
or
the
diamond
store,
but
the
stores
were
immediately
adjacent
to
one
another
on
huron
street.
during
these
five
trips
that
they
made
during
the
10
or
12
minute
period,
a
third
male
came
by,
white
male
who
stood
and
talked
with
the
two
males
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
the
other
male
proceeded
west,
on
euclid
avenue,
and
the
two
males
continued
on
this
corner.
after
the
10
to
12
minute
period,
the
two
men
then
walked
west
on
euclid
avenue,
some
several
hundred
feet
down
euclid
avenue.
when
they
arrived
at
zucker's
store,
which
is
in
the
vicinity
of
9th
street,
or
11th
street,
there
on
euclid
avenue,
the
three
males
then
again
met
up,
at
which
time
the
three
of
them,
according
to
the
police
officer's
testimony,
merely
standing
in
front
of
zucker's
store
--
mr.
louis
stokes
zucker's
is
a
haberdashery,
your
honor.
his
testimony
was
that
their
backs
were
to
the
plate
glass
windows.
they
were
facing
the
street,
and
when
interrogated
with
reference
to
what
they
were
doing,
he
said
they
were
merely
standing
there
talking.
he
described
their
gate
away
from
fourteenth
street
as
they
walked
down
to
the
haberdashery
as
a
normal
walk,
nothing
unusual
about
it.
the
police
officer
then
says,
i
then
went
over
to
the
three
men.
i
said
to
them,
i'm
a
police
officer.
what
are
your
names?
in
the
first
instance,
he
said,
they
gave
it
to
me
quick.
in
all
other
places
in
the
record,
he
says,
they
mumbled
something.
he
said,
at
this,
i
then
reached
out
and
got
terry.
i
spun
him
around,
holding
him
in
front
of
me.
i
then
began
to
pat
him
down.
once
he
had
patted,
patted
this
man
down,
he
says:
i
felt
inside
of
his
top
coat
what
felt
to
be
the
handle
of
a
gun.
i
then
reached
inside
the
coat
and
tried
to
remove
the
gun.
i
could
not
remove
the
gun.
i
therefore
took
the
entire
coat
off
of
him
and
then
took
the
gun
out
of
the
coat.
at
this
point,
he
says,
i
ordered
the
three
of
them
into
the
store.
as
i
walked
through
the
doorway,
i
said
to
the
store
personnel,
â€˜order
the
wagon.
he
later
explained
that
ordering
the
wagon
means
you
are
then
under
arrest.
once
inside
the
store,
the
three
men
were
ordered
up
against
the
wall,
whereupon
he
then
searched
chilton.
inside
of
chilton's
top
coat,
he
also
found
a
loaded
revolver.
he
searched
the
third
male,
katz,
upon
whom
he
found
nothing.
he
then
calls
these
men
to
be
removed
from
the
haberdashery
to
the
cleveland's
police
station.
when
they
arrived
at
the
police
station,
they
were
then
booked
for
investigation.
some
time
late
the
next
day,
after
having
been
interrogated
the
following
morning,
these
men
were
then
charged,
officially
late
the
second
day,
with
carrying
concealed
weapons.
the
police
officer
testified
further
with
reference
to
questions
propounded
to
him
having
to
bear
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
we
asked
him,
did
you
know
any
of
these
men?
no.
had
you
ever
seen
any
of
these
men
previously?
had
anyone
given
you
any
information
regarding
them?
he
was
then
asked
what
had
attracted
his
attention
to
them.
he
said,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
didn't
like
them.
and
i
was
attracted
to
their
actions
up
there
on
fourteenth
street.
mr.
louis
stokes
in
the
record
--
mr.
louis
stokes
he
said,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
didn't
like
them.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
then,
he
said
further,
mr.
justice,
that,
i
was
attracted
to
their
actions
there
at
fourteenth
street.
this
officer
testified
further,
though,
that
he
felt
that
they
might
be
casing
the
place
for
a
stick-up.
we
then
--
the
court
then
inquired
of
him
specifically
if
he
had
ever,
and
by
the
way,
this
police
officer
had
been
a
police
officer
for
39
years,
and
a
detective
for
35
years.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
was
in
plain
clothes,
your
honor.
the
court
specifically
asked
him
if
he
had,
during
his
39
years
as
a
police
officer
ever
previously
observed
any
one
casing
a
place.
he
said,
no,
he
had
not.
asked
if
he
had
arrested
anyone
for
casing
a
place,
in
his
39
years,
he
said
that
he
had
not.
we
should
like
to
make
reference,
just
briefly
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
matter.
our
court
held,
in
that
opinion,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
warrant
had
been
issued
for
a
search
or
frisk,
and
i
am
not
going
to
stress
the
facts
and
state
that
there
was
a
lawful
arrest
prior
to
the
frisk
of
the
defendants.
i
believe
it
would
be
stretching
the
facts
beyond
reasonable
comprehension,
and
foolhardy,
to
say
there
was
an
unlawful
arrest
because
there
wasn't
from
the
facts
as
presented.
later,
in
the
same
opinion,
our
trial
court
said,
i
believe,
and
i
reiterate
again,
that
search
and
seizure
laws
cannot
be
applied
to
this
particular
situation,
although
mr.
reuben
payne
endeavored
to
show
there
was
a
lawful
arrest.
but
the
court
cannot
agree.
if
there
was
an
arrest,
it
came
subsequent
to
the
frisk.
the
court
then
based
its
decision
upon
ker
versus
california.
the
court
said
that
the
ker
decision
did
not
preclude
the
states
from
developing
workable
rules
in
order
to
bring
about
effective
law
enforcement
in
the
states.
the
court
said,
with
reference
to
the
acquisition
of
the
gun,
that
the
gun
was
the
fruit
of
the
frisk
and
that
probable
cause
arose
once
the
police
officer
had
frisked,
found
the
gun;
he
then
had
the
probable
cause
to
arrest.
our
court
of
appeals,
in
affirming
the
decision,
stated
that,
a
policeman
may,
under
appropriate
circumstances,
reasonably
inquire
of
a
person
concerning
his
suspicious
on-the-street
behavior,
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
grounds
to
arrest.
our
court
admitted
that
in
all
probability
this
would
lead
to
abuses
by
the
police,
but
then
went
on
to
say
that,
the
court
would
deal
with
the
abuses
as
they
arose
before
the
court.
the
court
stated,
further,
that
this
of
course
was
just
a
minor
inconvenience
with
the
personal
liberty
that
is
guaranteed,
and
that
therefore
each
citizen
ought
to
be
willing
to
give
up
this
amount
of
his
personal
liberty
in
order
that
they
might
have
effective
law
enforcement
in
the
community.
our
court
offered
this
definition
of
arrest,
that
as
the
term
is
used
in
criminal
law,
it
signifies
the
apprehension
or
detention
of
the
person
of
another
in
order
that
he
may
be
forthcoming
to
answer
an
alleged
or
supposed
crime.
they
distinguished
henry
versus
u.s.
by
saying
that
in
that
case
the
government
had
made
a
concession,
and
therefore
when
this
court
rendered
henry
that
it
was
rendering
it
on
the
unique
situation
where
the
government
had
come
in
and
conceded
that
at
the
time
the
automobile
was
stopped,
the
arrest
had
occurred.
they,
therefore,
said
this
court
had
not,
in
that
case,
rendered
an
independent
view
of
the
facts;
and,
in
fact
held
that
this
was
an
arrest
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
we're
saying
that
and
we're
saying
in
addition
to
that,
this
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that,
at
the
point
this
police
officer
approached
these
men,
and
at
the
point
he
lay
his
hands
on
the
citizen,
that
he
had
--
he
did
not
have
the
probable
cause
that
is
required
--
he
has
stated
that
all
he
had,
at
that
point,
was
this
intuitive
sixth
sense,
and
that
he
had
never
in
his
long
experience
as
a
police
officer
ever
arrested
anyone
for
this
purpose.
mr.
louis
stokes
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
whatsoever,
and
we
might
add--
mr.
louis
stokes
this
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
stokes
this
is
what
he
said.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
correctly,
i
understood
him
to
say,
was
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicated
he
had
any
reason
to
be
concerned
with
his
own
personal
safety?
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
he
says,
after
he
says
he
thought
they
might
be
casing
the
place
--
and
i
felt
that
they
might
have
guns.
he
did
say
that.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
he
did.
but
in
our,
both
our
lower
court
and
in
our
appellate
court,
in
stating
that
a
police
officer
should
inquire
promptly
into
suspicious
on-the-street
activity,
we
brought
out
the
fact,
and
the
record
will
show,
that
there
was
no
interrogation,
there
was
no
investigation
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
the
officer
approaching.
now
the
court
has
said
that
he
had
the
right
to
approach,
to
investigate,
and
to
interrogate.
but
the
only
question
in
the
record
is,
what
are
your
names?
at
which
point,
he
then
grabbed
terry,
spun
him
around,
and
began
his
search.
during
the
interim
period
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
other
police
to
arrive,
there
was
no
conversation
between
the
police
officers
--
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
properly,
mr.
justice,
you
do
preface
it
by
saying
if
there
is
enough?
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
there
was
enough,
if
the
constitutional
criteria
had
been
met,
i
would
say,
yes,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
where
one
makes
a
valid
arrest--
mr.
louis
stokes
no,
i
say
if
he
wanted
to,
he
had
the
right
to
ask
them
a
question.
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
we
are
to
say,
first,
that
he
has
a
right
to
question,
i
am
saying
that
he
can
exercise
a
discretion
if
he
chooses.
i
am
not
saying
that,
at
that
point,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
question
them.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
i
am
saying
that,
mr.
justice.
i
am
saying
that
where
a
citizen
is
on
the
streets,
and
where
all
of
the
criteria
that
we
know
of
by
way
of
the
development
of
probable
cause
is
absent,
in
that
situation--
mr.
louis
stokes
well,
if
we
are
going
to
use
the
absolute
term
no
right,
and
we're
to
be
held
to
that,
then
i
would
just
have
to
say
he
has
no
right.
it
seems
to
me
he
wants
to
exercise
some
discretion
on
his
part,
of
walking
up
and
posing
a
question,
asking
a
name,
asking
an
address,
this
is
a
right
he
has.
by
the
same
token
that
the
person
whose
liberty
is
being
invaded,
the
person
who
has
committed
no
overt
wrong,
and
the
person
who
is
only
a
suspect,
at
that
point--
mr.
louis
stokes
no.
he
had
done
nothing
outside
of
what
a
policeman
might
ordinarily
do.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
would
say
that
under
the
circumstances
presented
to
me,
that
he
did
not
under
those
circumstances
have
the
right
to
lay
hands
on
this
citizen
and
spin
him
around.
mr.
louis
stokes
no
that
he
didn't
have
--
i
am
saying
that
at
the
point
that
you
lay
the
hand
on
the
citizen,
and
you
begin
to
exercise
dominion
over
that
citizen
on
the
street
by
spinning
him
around,
i
am
saying,
in
order
for
you
to
do
this
you
must
have
the
probable
cause
that
is
required
to
place
a
person
under
arrest,
because
if
the
person
is
substantially
under
your
custody,
your
dominion--
mr.
louis
stokes
yes.
mr.
louis
stokes
a
period
of
ten
to
twelve
minutes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us,
and
of
course
our
position
is
in
this
case
that
the
mapp
exclusionary
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
to
this
situation.
we're
not
here
advocating
any
change
with
reference
to
the
fourth
amendment.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state
is
in
a
position
of
saying
to
the
court
that
they
are
not
satisfied
with
the
mapp
exclusionary
rule.
as
we
read
the
rule
as
we
read
mapp,
we
don't
see
where
the
court
carved
out
any
exception
with
relation
to
a
gun.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
said
that
any
arrest
based
upon
anything
other
than
a
probable
cause
is
an
unreasonable
arrest,
and
that
all
of
the
evidence
must
be
excluded.
we
think
that
the
deterrent
that
mapp
affords
us
with
respect
to
illegal
searches
and
seizures
is
something
that
we
are
willing
to
continue
living
with.
although
terry
is
before
you,
we
think
it
goes
much
farther
than
this.
we
think
that
when
the
state
is
saying
that
there
is
something
called
reasonably
suspects,
reasonable
suspicion,
as
it
is
put
in
some
jurisdictions,
and
they're
asking
this
court
to
relax
the
fourth
amendment,
as
it
is
known,
they
are
in
effect
asking
this
court
to
nullify
the
fourth
amendment
and
to
overrule
mapp
versus
ohio.
we
think,
therefore,
that
if
this
is
to
prevail,
that
it
is
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
persuade
this
court
that
this
court
has
some
where
in
history
permitted
something
other
than
probable
cause
to
determine
whether
an
arrest
and
a
search
and
seizure
is
probable,
or
one
that
is
impermissible.
some
of
the
jurisdictions--
mr.
louis
stokes
only
if
we're
going
to
relax
the
standard
of
probable
cause,
as
we
know
it,
under
the
fourth
amendment.
he
didn't
permit
the
situation
to
ripen
into
the
point
where
it
had
ripened
into
a
probable-cause-type
of
a
situation.
he
was
a
little
ahead
of
himself,
in
this
situation,
and
our
position
would
have
to
be
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to
protect
a
constitutionally
impermissible
arrest;
and,
consequently,
this
is
the
way
we
would
have
to
answer
it.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
certainly
has
a
right
of
self-defense,
and
he
has
a
right
to
protect
himself.
but
the
product,
once
it
has
been
removed,
the
danger
has
been
removed;
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case,
since
it
was
not
based
upon
probable
cause,
we
should
not
protect
the
constitutionally
impermissible
arrest,
by
permitting
the
yield
of
that
arrest
to
come
into
evidence
against
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
think
we
are
faced
with
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
average
police
officer
would
do
this
under
these
circumstances.
if
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
any
type
of
danger
that
he
would
conduct
a
search,
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
own
life
in
a
possibly
dangerous
situation.
but
i
am
saying
that
we
cannot
merely
because
of
that
type
of
situation,
and
not
being
what
is
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
we
can't
give
sanctity
to
it
by
way
of
saying,
since
you
did
find
this
product,
we're
going
to
permit
it
into
the
evidence.
mr.
louis
stokes
certainly,
your
honor.
another
reason
we
think
that
the
court
--
another
thing
that
i
think
the
court
has
to
take
into
consideration
here,
of
course,
is
the
impossibility
that
this
court
has
of
standardizing
such
a
subjective
thing
as
intuition.
all
the
amicus
briefs
say,
permit
us
this
standard
that
is
less
than
probable
cause;
permit
us
to
stop
and
frisk
people
on
the
streets.
now
experience
has
already
taught
us,
if
the
court
please,
that
policemen
have
had
enough
difficulty
being
able
to
grapple
with
and
to
determine
for
themselves
what
is
tantamount
to
probable
cause,
as
it
has
been
enunciated
in
the
decisions
by
this
court.
now
they're
saying
to
this
court,
give
us
another
standard.
give
us
this,
reasonably
suspects,
or
based
upon
suspicion,
or
whatever
the
standard
is
that's
less
than
probable
cause.
we
think
that
we're
just
compounding
the
policeman's
problems
if
the
court
does
permit
this
type
of
a
thing
to
occur.
with
reference
to
the
basic
guarantee
that
we
are
concerned
about
here,
i
don't
think
we
are
so
much
concerned,
really,
about
terry,
because
over
the
years
it
has
been
the
person
who
has
been
involved
in
criminal
activity
that
has
come
before
this
court
in
order
for
this
court
to
again
take
a
look
at
some
of
our
basic
constitutional
guarantees.
i
think,
through
terry,
that
we
look
at
the
hundreds
of
people
walking
the
street
by
the
day
because
police
officers,
or
a
police
officer,
finds
himself
observing
a
situation
where
he
says,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
just
didn't
like
them
and
then
i
began
watching
them.
then
the
fact
that
he
wants
to
go
further,
and
at
that
point,
i
think
we're
subjecting
all
of
the
people
who
have
this
inviolate
right
of
privacy,
to
this
type
of
activity
on
the
public
streets
throughout
our
nation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
can't
take
it
that
far.
mr.
louis
stokes
i'm
saying
that
where
the
police
officer
chooses,
with
reference
to
whatever
his
determination
has
been,
to
interrogate
or
to
investigate
further
with
respect
to
citizens
lawfully
on
the
street,
that
in
order
to
exercise
dominion
or
custody
or
control
over
that
citizen,
and
thereby
deprive
him
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
he
must
have
before
approaching
him
that
probable
cause
which
this
court
has
made
reference
to
in
its
decisions.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
has
the
right
to
approach
him
and
ask
his
questions.
mr.
louis
stokes
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
this
person
having
committed
any
crime
of
any
sort,
and
where
the
approach
is
based
on
suspicion
alone,
the
person
being
subjected
to
the
interrogation
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer,
or
to
turn
away.
mr.
louis
stokes
mr.
justice,
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
giving
you
the
impression
that
a
police
officer
cannot
ask
him
a
question.
mr.
louis
stokes
he
can
arrest
him,
if
he
chooses.
mr.
louis
stokes
then
i
don't
think
he
has
that
right.
mr.
louis
stokes
that
is
precisely
what
i'm
saying,
because
otherwise
the
fourth's
--
inviolate
right
of
privacy
is
being
invaded.
mr.
louis
stokes
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
stokes
thank
you.
