justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
in
plain
clothes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
stokes,
do
you
really
think
that
if
there
is
enough
to
suggest
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
they
had
weapons,
if
that's
so
then
it
is
justified
for
that
reason
in
asking
them
what
they
were
doing,
don't
you
think
he
would
be
justified
in
the
first
instance
in
confirming
whether
or
not
they
did
have
weapons
before
he
went
on
further
to
interrogate
them,
or
even
to
interrogate
him
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
right,
yes,
in
this
colloquy
you
and
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
stewart
were
having,
on
the
premise
that
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
think
that
they
had
weapons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
you
quarrel
with
the
fact
that--or
do
you
suggest
there
had
to
be
more
than
appeared,
before
he
could
ask
him
a
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
he
had
the
right
to
ask
them
a
question,
lay
that
aside
for
a
moment,
and
he
also
had
reason
to
think
they
might
have
weapons
on
them,
would
he
have
to
question
before
he
frisked
him
for
weapons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
would
he,
in
your
view,
be
abusing
any
right
of
the
three
of
them
in
walking
up
to
them
and
asking
their
names
and
what
they
were
doing
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that,
then,
the
officer
has
no
right
to
stop
and
ask,
what's
your
name?
what
are
you
doing
here?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
we
try
to
get
at
it,
in
this
way,
mr.
stokes,
up
to
the
point
where
he
spun
terry
around,
had
he
done
anything
outside
what
a
policeman
might
properly
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
then
at
that
juncture
he
had
reason
to
believe
they
might
be
armed,
did
he
have
to
complete
his
questioning
first?
or
could
he
frisk
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
be
because
you
do
not
think
the
record
shows
that
he
had
any
reason
to
believe
they
had
weapons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
mean
he
can't
frisk
for
weapons,
without
probable
cause
to
arrest?
is
that
what
you
re
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
payne,
regarding
the
use
of
--
you
have
said
repeatedly
now,
if
i
understand
you,
that
probable
cause
--
are
you
saying
something
like
this:
that
while
there
may
not
have
been
probable
cause
to
arrest,
in
the
sense
of
taking
him
to
the
police
station
and
booking
him
for
some
crime,
that
at
least
in
these
circumstances
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest,
in
the
sense
of
asking
them
questions
such
as:
who
are
you,
and
what
are
you
doing
here?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
saying
probable
cause,
in
these
circumstances
--
and
i
gather
what
you
must
mean
--
is
that
if
the
detainment
is
an
arrest,
it
was
to
be
a
detention
only
long
enough
to
find
out
what
they
were
doing.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
then,
if
the
officer
had
probable
cause
to
think
they
had
weapons
on
them,
that
in
those
circumstances
he
was
justified
in
frisking
them
for
weapons.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
what
i
understood
to
be
your
argument
in
the
use
of
probable
cause.
what
you're
really
doing
is
saying
you
don't
have
to
change
the
label;
it's
still
probable
cause,
and
it's
still
an
arrest
--
but
an
arrest,
for
the
purpose
merely
of
asking
the
question:
who
are
you
and
why
are
we
here?
and
this
is
a
different
thing
than
an
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
taking
them
to
the
station
house
and
booking
them
for
a
crime.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
forgetting
ohio
law
for
a
moment,
how
about
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
agreed
with
justice
black
before,
that
really,
reasonable
action
and
probable
cause
are
pretty
much
synonymous
terms?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
can
stick
to
the
jargon
of
probable
cause
and
make
the
distinction
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
payne,
that's
not
quite
the
same
thing
you
said
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand.
i
thought
you
said
to
me
earlier
that
there
might
be
an
arrest,
for
some
purposes;
and
an
arrest
for
some
other
purposes
--
fourth
amendment
purposes;
and
that
an
arrest,
for
the
purpose
of
asking
a
chap
his
name
--
which
follows
from
a
detention
--
or,
what's
he
doing
here,
there
might
be
probable
cause
for
that
sort
of
thing
without
any
violations,
even
though
it
could
not
be
in
the
same
circumstances
probable
cause
to
take
him
to
the
station
house
and
book
him
for
a
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
certainly
not
an
arrest
in
the
sense
of
taking
him
to
the
station
house
and
booking
him
for
a
crime;
but,
if
he's
detained,
isn't
it
in
the
nature
of
an
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
use
the
fourth
amendment
language,
then.
when
was
the
first
seizure
of
the
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
when
he
took
terry
and
swung
him
around
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
had
his
hands
on
him
and
he
switched
him
around.
surely
--
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
word
is
in
the
fourth
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
in
plain
clothes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
stokes,
do
you
really
think
that
if
there
is
enough
to
suggest
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
they
had

if
that's
so
then
it
is

what
