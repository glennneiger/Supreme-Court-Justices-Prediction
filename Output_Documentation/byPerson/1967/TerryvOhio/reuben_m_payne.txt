mr.
reuben
m.
payne
mr.
chief
justice,
it
please
the
members
of
the
court,
at
the
outset,
may
i
direct
my
attention
to
page
19
of
my
brief.
there
it
is
indicated
that
after
the
officer
had
testified
that
he
observed
the
conduct
of
these
men,
and
that
he
had
concluded
that
they
were
casing
an
establishment
for
a
robbery,
we
find
this
quote
appearing
from
the
record,
question:
detective
mcfadden,
can
you
tell
us
why
you
turned
john
terry
around
facing
the
other
two
men,
with
you
behind
him?
answer:
due
to
my
observation,
the
observation
on
huron
road
of
these
two
men,
i
felt
as
though
they
were
going
to
pull
a
stick-up
and
they
may
have
a
gun.
that
is
supported
and
substantiated
in
the
record
of
this
particular
case.
a
question
has
been
asked
here,
what
is
the
difference
between
reasonable
suspicion,
and
probable
cause?
in
one
instance,
in
the
arguments
of
the
case
before
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
peters
case,
has
said,
it
is
that
cause
which
is
somewhat
below
probable
cause
on
the
scale
of
absolute
knowledge
of
criminal
activity.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
cannot
see
any
basic
difference
in
having
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
equating
it
with
the
term
probable
cause,
in
of
itself.
it
has
been
indicated
that
we
have
asked
for
a
different
standard
here,
as
to
probable
cause.
i
find
no
problem
with
this
particularly,
because
i
do
not
ask
for
a
different
standard
of
probable
cause,
as
it
may
relate
to
the
right
to
lawfully
arrest
a
person.
i
think
the
quantum
of
evidence
that
is
basic
and
essential
under
the
circumstances
to
establish
probable
cause
for
the
officer
to
arrest
or
to
stop
a
person
and
to
ask
him
questions,
may
be
somewhat
lesser
in
degree
but,
by
the
same
token,
it
is
probable
cause
under
any
circumstances.
the
same
circumstances
are
indicated
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
probable
cause
to
mean,
for
an
arrest,
that
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
when
a
person
is
observed
in
circumstances
which
suggest
that
he
has
committed,
or
is
about
to
commit
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
and
such
action
is
reasonably
necessary
to
enable
the
officer
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
person's
conduct;
and
the
key
word
here
is
the
circumstances
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
that
to
mean
the
taking
into
consideration
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
as
a
responsible
person
views
it,
at
that
particular
time
in
relation
to
his
work.
for
example,
the
police
officer
here,
in
taking
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
he
observed,
under
the
conditions
which
he
observed
them,
that
the
conduct
that
existed
and
the
idea
that
maybe
were
flowing
from
the
conduct
which
he
observed
here,
would
establish
probable
cause.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
--
i
believe
that
it
does
mean
reasonable
grounds
that
something
is
going
to
happen.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
bound
to
happen.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
with
you,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct;
he
did
so
testify.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that's
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
think
that
he
would
get
his
expertise
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
police
department
for
forty
years,
and
by
being
a
member
of
the
police
department
for
forty
years
i
am
quite
sure
that,
even
if
by
osmosis,
some
knowledge
would
have
to
come
to
him
of
the
various
degrees
of
crimes
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
not
at
all,
sir.
not
at
all.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that;
nor
did
i
mean
any
disrespect
by
so
using
that
particular
term.
i
think
that,
for
example,
if
i
as
a
lawyer
i'm
around
a
particular
office
for
a
number
of
years
but
i
certainly
must
gain
knowledge
about
various
concepts
of
law
that
may
come
about
from
time
to
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
with
the
court
in
these
circumstances
also.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
was
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
may
i
then,
in
response
to
the
justice's
question,
indicate
first
of
all,
and
clarify
this,
his
testimony
was
not
that
he
didn't
like
him.
his
testimony
was
that
he
didn't
like
their
looks.
now
i
don't
think
that
he
meant
by
that
any
reference
to
pigmentation
or
anything
else.
i
think
that
he
meant
by
that,
when
we
take
the
entire
record
into
consideration,
the
fact
that
this
was
in
a
downtown
area
that
these
people
were
not
continuing
in
the
regular
flow
of
commerce
of
other
people
on
the
street
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
they
beared
watching.
they
were
standing
on
the
corner
conversing.
then,
because
of
their
not
continuing
in
the
flow
of
regular
commerce,
he
observed
one
of
the
petitioners
walk
away
from
the
other
one
and
proceed
approximately
100
feet
west,
up
the
street.
he
noticed
the
unusual
activity
of
this
petitioner
peering
into
the
jewelry
store,
or
the
airline
office
there,
that
there
was
something
in
the
vicinity
of
the
airline
office
--
or
the
jewelry
store,
which
excited
the
petitioner's
attention
in
some
manner,
or
in
some
way.
he
then
returned
to
his
companion
on
the
corner,
had
a
conversation
with
his
companion;
his
companion,
in
turn
alternately
proceeded
up
the
street,
and
conducted
himself
in
the
very
same
manner;
that
they
alternated
in
this
way,
four
or
five
times;
that,
thereupon,
a
third
man
came
from
across
the
street
and
had
a
conversation
with
them
and
after
having
that
conversation
with
them;
that
the
third
man
returned
back
across
the
street
and
stationed
himself
there;
that
these
individuals
then
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
i
have
described
previously,
four
or
five
additional
trips
after
that.
and,
that
then
after
engaging
in
these
additional
trips,
making
a
total
of
some
ten
to
twelve
trips,
he
observed
that
their
interest
was
centered
on
the
jewelry
store
or
the
airline
office;
that
after
so
making
the
total
number
of
trips,
they
then
went
across
the
street,
and
there
again
the
three
men
came
together,
at
which
time
they
were
having
a
conversation
and
at
which
time
the
officer
had
concluded
that
they
were
casing
the
establishment
for
a
stickup.
under
these
circumstances,
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
taking
into
consideration
that
an
officer
who
is
by
himself,
taking
into
consideration
the
number
of
persons
involved
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
the
trial
court
indicated
that,
at
this
point,
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
arrest.
the
appellate
court
did
indicate
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
arrest,
after
the
frisk
took
place.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
with
this.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
he
didn't
get
probable
cause
to
arrest--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
he
received
probable
cause
for
arrest
when
he
turned
terry
around
and
ran
his
hands
over
the
outside
of
his
clothing
and,
feeling
a
gun
in
the
upper
left-breast
pocket,
and
indicating
emphatically
at
that
time
that,
what
i
felt
was
a
gun,
a
weapon.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree.
he
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
that
he
would
have
probable
cause
to
frisk,
or
to
lay
hands
on
him,
at
this
point.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
because
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
and
protection
of
his
own
life.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
he
did
not
say
that
he
saw
a
gun
bulging.
he
indicated
that:
they
were
casing
a
joint
for
a
robbery,
which
implies
a
crime
of
violence,
which
implies
that
they
have
a
gun.
that,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
after
he
made
an
identification
of
himself
when
approaching
these
men,
and
indicated
to
them
that
he
was
a
police
officer,
that
the
response
which
they
gave
was
in
the
manner
of
evading
the
question
which
he
had
put
to
them,
under
these
circumstances
i
think
that
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
the
question
which
was
put
to
them
by
the
officers:
what
are
your
names?
as
to
this,
there
was
a
mumbled,
incoherent
response
made
in
reply
to
that
particular
question.
and
this,
of
course,
coupled
with
his
observations
and
conclusions
which
he
had
made
previously,
there
was
probable
cause
for
this
officer
to
further
investigate
for
weapons,
under
these
circumstances,
to
determine
and
to
protect
his
own
life
here.
now,
it
is
my
contention
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
hesitate
in
the
use
of
the
term
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
and,
to
--
if
i
may
put
it
in
my
own
language,
i
am
saying
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
officer
to
interfere
with
their
freedom
of
action,
at
this
point,
and
that
such
interference
with
their
freedom
of
action
is
not
in
a
significant
way
at
this
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
under
ohio
law,
i
could
not
agree
with
this
concept
because
under
ohio
law
the
definition
of
arrest,
is
by
statute.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
would
be
reasonable
action
on
the
part
of
this
officer
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree.
i
think
that
the
court
can
stick
to
the
jargon
of
probable
cause
and
make
any
distinctions
under
the
circumstances
in
this
respect.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
is
not
an
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
arrest
him
to
ask
him
a
question.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
arrest
him
to
touch
him.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
interfere
with
his
freedom
in
a
significant
way.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
--
because
i
had
indicated
to
the
court
that
certainly
arrest,
in
ohio,
is
defined
by
statute.
and
i
thought
i
did
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
detention
of
his
freedom
here,
at
that
time,
is
not
an
arrest
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it
to
be
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
that
his
freedom
of
movement
was
arrested.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
do
not
agree
that
his
freedom
of
movement
was
arrested
in
a
significant
way.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no.
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
the
circumstances
involved
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
if
there
had
been
no
more
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
some
time
after
he
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
not
on
the
basis
of
his
swinging
him
around;
but
on
the
basis
of
the
concealed
weapon
which
he
was
carrying,
and
the
crime
that
he
was
committing
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
at
that
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
speaking
in
ordinary
terms,
he
was
arrested
after
the
officer
dropped
that
weapon
and
ordered
them
into
the
interior
of
the
store.
and
it
was
not
until
that
time,
after
he
felt
the
weapon
on
the
outside
--
he
did
insert
his
hand
and
felt
the
butt
of
the
gun
afterwards,
and
after
taking
them
on
the
inside
and
they
were
placed
against
the
wall;
when
the
coat
was
pulled
from
his
shoulders
and
then
the
gun
was
taken
from
out
of
the
pocket
of
terry;
he
then
went
to
the
other
petitioner
and
patted
him
on
the
outside
of
his
clothing
and
thereupon
felt
a
weapon
that
he
had
testified
to
--
it
was
after
patting
on
the
outside
of
his
clothing,
that
he
inserted
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
removed
the
weapon
from
the
second
individual,
or
person
involved
here.
so,
the
arrest
took
place
the
moment
that
he
ordered
them
into
the
store
itself.
their
freedom
of
movement
was
interfered
with,
significantly,
at
that
time
so
that
they
could
not
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
the
first
seizure
of
the
person
was
at
the
time
that
he
ordered
them
into
the
store.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
think
there
was
a
temporary
detaining,
or
interference
with
his
person.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
but
here
again
we're
dealing
in
simply
semantic
words.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
that
it
is,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
is
an
arrest
that
i
understand
we
are
discussing
in
this
matter.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
with
this
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
--
that
he
could
very
easily
turn
the
man
around,
and
some
may
term
that
as
a
seizure
of
the
person
himself;
but
i
would
not
term
that
it
as
a
seizure
of
the
person
himself
unless
he
has
the
intention
of
taking
that
person
into
custody,
even
though
he
may
lay
hands
on
him
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree.
i
think
that
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
of
the
petitioners
on
the
law
in
the
instant
case
is
reasonable,
is
necessary,
and
is
appropriate
to
secure
the
safety
and
the
welfare
and
the
best
interest
of
the
public
of
the
state
of
ohio,
because
we
are
asking
here
--
and
i
am,
perhaps,
bound
to
indicate
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested
in
this
particular
case
--
that
we
authorize
the
stopping
under
these
circumstances
where
there
are
these
surrounding
circumstances,
for
the
protection
of
the
officer's
life
and
for
the
protection
to
the
community
that
will
exist
if
this
is
not
permitted
in
this
manner
and
this
way,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
that
exist
at
this
time.
the
means
that
is
selected,
as
enunciated
by
our
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
have
a
direct
substantial
relationship
to
the
concept
of
the
safety
and
the
welfare
sought
to
be
attained
in
the
affirmance
of
this
particular
case
here.
if
we
consider
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
that
he
gave
his
opinion
in
connection
with
this
matter,
the
trial
judge
made
these
remarks:
i
am
a
great
believer
of
the
personal
rights
propounded
by
our
supreme
court,
reiterated
and
reaffirmed,
neglected
over
the
years
and
given
to
us
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
other
amendments
of
the
constitution.
secondly,
the
trial
court
said,
at
the
same
time,
a
police
officer
cannot,
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
and
will
not
be
permitted
to
stop
and
frisk
an
individual
simply
because
he
has
a
suspicion
--
a
mere
suspicion
--
unless
there
are
reasonable
circumstances
justifying
the
frisk.
three.
when
the
circumstances
justify,
and
there
is
reasonable
suspicion,
and
for
his
own
personal
protection,
he
may
frisk
to
determine
if
there
are
weapons
for
his
personal
safety.
four.
the
officer
assigned
in
the
area
in
which
he
had
been
placed,
doing
the
job
he
had
been
doing,
and
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
and
to
suspect
that
the
defendants
were
conducting
themselves
suspiciously
and
some
interrogation
should
be
made
of
their
action.
five.
there
was
reasonable
cause
in
this
case
for
the
officer
to
approach
these
individuals
and
pat
them
down.
here
is
a
decided
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
equate
and
balance
the
rights
of
the
individuals
with
the
rights
of
the
public
and
the
safety
that
is
involved
herein
as
it
pertains
to
the
officer
in
this
particular
case.
what
are
the
reasonable
cause
--
circumstances
that
existed
in
the
mind
of
the
officer
at
that
particular
time?
one,
we
have
a
police
officer
in
his
particular
area,
on
duty,
and
his
duty
is
to
maintain
law
and
order.
his
duty,
too,
is
to
prevent
crime
if
he
can
so
do.
secondly,
he
has
39
years
of
experience
herein.
fourth,
the
observations
of
the
suspicious
activity
which
he
observed,
which
may
be
determined
as
pre-detention
conduct.
five,
he
concludes
from
the
observations
and
the
conduct
of
these
men
that
a
crime
of
violence
with
the
use
of
weapons
in
probability
may
be
committed
under
these
circumstances.
sixth,
he
decides
to
investigate
and
to
interrogate,
and
the
record
indicates
and
shows
that
at
this
particular
time,
why
did
you
go
over
to
these
men?
i
went
over
to
them
to
ask
them
some
questions.
eight,
when
he
asked
their
names,
he
received
this
mumbled
incoherent
response,
which
further
gave
rise
to
the
circumstances
that
he
had
concluded
previously
that
a
stick-up
was
possible
here.
at
this
point,
taking
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
he
has
concluded
--
a
stick-up
--
and
the
use
of
weapons
as
they
are
characteristically
used
in
a
stick-up,
there
is
only
one
course
of
conduct
then
open
to
a
prudent
police
officer.
and
that
is,
to
frisk
or
pat
for
weapons,
for
the
protection
of
his
life.
this
is
why
we
considered
it
in
the
interest
of
safety
and
public
welfare
in
the
state
of
ohio.
seven
--
or,
not
seven,
but
--
ten,
there
was
the
absence
of
assistance
to
this
officer,
at
this
time,
in
relation
to
the
number
of
individuals
involved
here.
there
was
one
police
officer
and
three
men.
the
type
of
clothing,
also,
he
considered
at
this
particular
time
because
they
were
wearing
overcoats,
and
the
possibility
that
they
might
have
concealed
weapons,
as
they
did
exist
here;
the
sex
of
the
subjects,
also,
i
think
he
had
to
take
into
consideration,
at
this
particular
time.
there
were
three
agile,
young
men
that
he
was
confronting,
and
he
was
by
himself
at
this
particular
time.
under
these
circumstances
that
he
was
confronted
with
at
this
time,
i
believe
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
public
safety;
i
believe
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
society,
that
he
have
the
right,
based
on
these
probable
cause
circumstances,
to
frisk
this
man,
to
temporarily
detain
him,
to
ascertain
that
which
he
has
observed,
and
to
confiscate
any
weapons
which
he
may
find
on
his
person
at
that
particular
time;
and,
that
they
are
admissible
in
the
evidence
of
his
trial
subsequent
thereto.
i
think
that
if,
as
the
question
was
placed
by
one
of
the
justices
of
the
court,
that
after
the
probable
cause
that
exists
here
in
this
particular
case,
i
feel
that
the
judgment
in
the
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
mr.
chief
justice,
it
please
the
members
of
the
court,
at
the
outset,
may
i
direct
my
attention
to
page
19
of
my
brief.
there
it
is
indicated
that
after
the
officer
had
testified
that
he
observed
the
conduct
of
these
men,
and
that
he
had
concluded
that
they
were
casing
an
establishment
for
a
robbery,
we
find
this
quote
appearing
from
the
record,
question:
detective
mcfadden,
can
you
tell
us
why
you
turned
john
terry
around
facing
the
other
two
men,
with
you
behind
him?
answer:
due
to
my
observation,
the
observation
on
huron
road
of
these
two
men,
i
felt
as
though
they
were
going
to
pull
a
stick-up
and
they
may
have
a
gun.
that
is
supported
and
substantiated
in
the
record
of
this
particular
case.
a
question
has
been
asked
here,
what
is
the
difference
between
reasonable
suspicion,
and
probable
cause?
in
one
instance,
in
the
arguments
of
the
case
before
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
peters
case,
has
said,
it
is
that
cause
which
is
somewhat
below
probable
cause
on
the
scale
of
absolute
knowledge
of
criminal
activity.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
cannot
see
any
basic
difference
in
having
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
equating
it
with
the
term
probable
cause,
in
of
itself.
it
has
been
indicated
that
we
have
asked
for
a
different
standard
here,
as
to
probable
cause.
i
find
no
problem
with
this
particularly,
because
i
do
not
ask
for
a
different
standard
of
probable
cause,
as
it
may
relate
to
the
right
to
lawfully
arrest
a
person.
i
think
the
quantum
of
evidence
that
is
basic
and
essential
under
the
circumstances
to
establish
probable
cause
for
the
officer
to
arrest
or
to
stop
a
person
and
to
ask
him
questions,
may
be
somewhat
lesser
in
degree
but,
by
the
same
token,
it
is
probable
cause
under
any
circumstances.
the
same
circumstances
are
indicated
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
probable
cause
to
mean,
for
an
arrest,
that
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
when
a
person
is
observed
in
circumstances
which
suggest
that
he
has
committed,
or
is
about
to
commit
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
and
such
action
is
reasonably
necessary
to
enable
the
officer
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
person's
conduct;
and
the
key
word
here
is
the
circumstances
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
that
to
mean
the
taking
into
consideration
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
as
a
responsible
person
views
it,
at
that
particular
time
in
relation
to
his
work.
for
example,
the
police
officer
here,
in
taking
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
he
observed,
under
the
conditions
which
he
observed
them,
that
the
conduct
that
existed
and
the
idea
that
maybe
were
flowing
from
the
conduct
which
he
observed
here,
would
establish
probable
cause.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
understand
--
i
believe
that
it
does
mean
reasonable
grounds
that
something
is
going
to
happen.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
bound
to
happen.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
with
you,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct;
he
did
so
testify.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that's
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
think
that
he
would
get
his
expertise
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
police
department
for
forty
years,
and
by
being
a
member
of
the
police
department
for
forty
years
i
am
quite
sure
that,
even
if
by
osmosis,
some
knowledge
would
have
to
come
to
him
of
the
various
degrees
of
crimes
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
not
at
all,
sir.
not
at
all.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that;
nor
did
i
mean
any
disrespect
by
so
using
that
particular
term.
i
think
that,
for
example,
if
i
as
a
lawyer
i'm
around
a
particular
office
for
a
number
of
years
but
i
certainly
must
gain
knowledge
about
various
concepts
of
law
that
may
come
about
from
time
to
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
with
the
court
in
these
circumstances
also.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
was
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
may
i
then,
in
response
to
the
justice's
question,
indicate
first
of
all,
and
clarify
this,
his
testimony
was
not
that
he
didn't
like
him.
his
testimony
was
that
he
didn't
like
their
looks.
now
i
don't
think
that
he
meant
by
that
any
reference
to
pigmentation
or
anything
else.
i
think
that
he
meant
by
that,
when
we
take
the
entire
record
into
consideration,
the
fact
that
this
was
in
a
downtown
area
that
these
people
were
not
continuing
in
the
regular
flow
of
commerce
of
other
people
on
the
street
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
they
beared
watching.
they
were
standing
on
the
corner
conversing.
then,
because
of
their
not
continuing
in
the
flow
of
regular
commerce,
he
observed
one
of
the
petitioners
walk
away
from
the
other
one
and
proceed
approximately
100
feet
west,
up
the
street.
he
noticed
the
unusual
activity
of
this
petitioner
peering
into
the
jewelry
store,
or
the
airline
office
there,
that
there
was
something
in
the
vicinity
of
the
airline
office
--
or
the
jewelry
store,
which
excited
the
petitioner's
attention
in
some
manner,
or
in
some
way.
he
then
returned
to
his
companion
on
the
corner,
had
a
conversation
with
his
companion;
his
companion,
in
turn
alternately
proceeded
up
the
street,
and
conducted
himself
in
the
very
same
manner;
that
they
alternated
in
this
way,
four
or
five
times;
that,
thereupon,
a
third
man
came
from
across
the
street
and
had
a
conversation
with
them
and
after
having
that
conversation
with
them;
that
the
third
man
returned
back
across
the
street
and
stationed
himself
there;
that
these
individuals
then
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
i
have
described
previously,
four
or
five
additional
trips
after
that.
and,
that
then
after
engaging
in
these
additional
trips,
making
a
total
of
some
ten
to
twelve
trips,
he
observed
that
their
interest
was
centered
on
the
jewelry
store
or
the
airline
office;
that
after
so
making
the
total
number
of
trips,
they
then
went
across
the
street,
and
there
again
the
three
men
came
together,
at
which
time
they
were
having
a
conversation
and
at
which
time
the
officer
had
concluded
that
they
were
casing
the
establishment
for
a
stickup.
under
these
circumstances,
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
taking
into
consideration
that
an
officer
who
is
by
himself,
taking
into
consideration
the
number
of
persons
involved
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
the
trial
court
indicated
that,
at
this
point,
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
arrest.
the
appellate
court
did
indicate
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
arrest,
after
the
frisk
took
place.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
with
this.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
he
didn't
get
probable
cause
to
arrest--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
he
received
probable
cause
for
arrest
when
he
turned
terry
around
and
ran
his
hands
over
the
outside
of
his
clothing
and,
feeling
a
gun
in
the
upper
left-breast
pocket,
and
indicating
emphatically
at
that
time
that,
what
i
felt
was
a
gun,
a
weapon.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree.
he
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
that
he
would
have
probable
cause
to
frisk,
or
to
lay
hands
on
him,
at
this
point.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
because
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
and
protection
of
his
own
life.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no,
he
did
not
say
that
he
saw
a
gun
bulging.
he
indicated
that:
they
were
casing
a
joint
for
a
robbery,
which
implies
a
crime
of
violence,
which
implies
that
they
have
a
gun.
that,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
after
he
made
an
identification
of
himself
when
approaching
these
men,
and
indicated
to
them
that
he
was
a
police
officer,
that
the
response
which
they
gave
was
in
the
manner
of
evading
the
question
which
he
had
put
to
them,
under
these
circumstances
i
think
that
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
the
question
which
was
put
to
them
by
the
officers:
what
are
your
names?
as
to
this,
there
was
a
mumbled,
incoherent
response
made
in
reply
to
that
particular
question.
and
this,
of
course,
coupled
with
his
observations
and
conclusions
which
he
had
made
previously,
there
was
probable
cause
for
this
officer
to
further
investigate
for
weapons,
under
these
circumstances,
to
determine
and
to
protect
his
own
life
here.
now,
it
is
my
contention
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
hesitate
in
the
use
of
the
term
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
and,
to
--
if
i
may
put
it
in
my
own
language,
i
am
saying
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
officer
to
interfere
with
their
freedom
of
action,
at
this
point,
and
that
such
interference
with
their
freedom
of
action
is
not
in
a
significant
way
at
this
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
under
ohio
law,
i
could
not
agree
with
this
concept
because
under
ohio
law
the
definition
of
arrest,
is
by
statute.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
would
be
reasonable
action
on
the
part
of
this
officer
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree.
i
think
that
the
court
can
stick
to
the
jargon
of
probable
cause
and
make
any
distinctions
under
the
circumstances
in
this
respect.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
is
not
an
arrest.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
arrest
him
to
ask
him
a
question.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
arrest
him
to
touch
him.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
does
not
interfere
with
his
freedom
in
a
significant
way.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
--
because
i
had
indicated
to
the
court
that
certainly
arrest,
in
ohio,
is
defined
by
statute.
and
i
thought
i
did
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
detention
of
his
freedom
here,
at
that
time,
is
not
an
arrest
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it
to
be
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree
that
his
freedom
of
movement
was
arrested.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
do
not
agree
that
his
freedom
of
movement
was
arrested
in
a
significant
way.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
no.
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
the
circumstances
involved
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
if
there
had
been
no
more
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
some
time
after
he
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
not
on
the
basis
of
his
swinging
him
around;
but
on
the
basis
of
the
concealed
weapon
which
he
was
carrying,
and
the
crime
that
he
was
committing
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
at
that
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
speaking
in
ordinary
terms,
he
was
arrested
after
the
officer
dropped
that
weapon
and
ordered
them
into
the
interior
of
the
store.
and
it
was
not
until
that
time,
after
he
felt
the
weapon
on
the
outside
--
he
did
insert
his
hand
and
felt
the
butt
of
the
gun
afterwards,
and
after
taking
them
on
the
inside
and
they
were
placed
against
the
wall;
when
the
coat
was
pulled
from
his
shoulders
and
then
the
gun
was
taken
from
out
of
the
pocket
of
terry;
he
then
went
to
the
other
petitioner
and
patted
him
on
the
outside
of
his
clothing
and
thereupon
felt
a
weapon
that
he
had
testified
to
--
it
was
after
patting
on
the
outside
of
his
clothing,
that
he
inserted
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
removed
the
weapon
from
the
second
individual,
or
person
involved
here.
so,
the
arrest
took
place
the
moment
that
he
ordered
them
into
the
store
itself.
their
freedom
of
movement
was
interfered
with,
significantly,
at
that
time
so
that
they
could
not
--

the
first
seizure
of
the
person
was
at
the
time
that
he
ordered
them
into
the
store.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
think
there
was
a
temporary
detaining,
or
interference
with
his
person.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
but
here
again
we're
dealing
in
simply
semantic
words.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
that
it
is,
sir.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
it
is
an
arrest
that
i
understand
we
are
discussing
in
this
matter.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
agree
with
this
--
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
--
that
he
could
very
easily
turn
the
man
around,
and
some
may
term
that
as
a
seizure
of
the
person
himself;
but
i
would
not
term
that
it
as
a
seizure
of
the
person
himself
unless
he
has
the
intention
of
taking
that
person
into
custody,
even
though
he
may
lay
hands
on
him
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reuben
m.
payne
i
would
agree.
i
think
that
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
of
the
petitioners
on
the
law
in
the
instant
case
is
reasonable,
is
necessary,
and
is
appropriate
to
secure
the
safety
and
the
welfare
and
the
best
interest
of
the
public
of
the
state
of
ohio,
because
we
are
asking
here
--
and
i
am,
perhaps,
bound
to
indicate
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested
in
this
particular
case
--
that
we
authorize
the
stopping
under
these
circumstances
where
there
are
these
surrounding
circumstances,
for
the
protection
of
the
officer's
life
and
for
the
protection
to
the
community
that
will
exist
if
this
is
not
permitted
in
this
manner
and
this
way,
depending
upon
the
circumstances
that
exist
at
this
time.
the
means
that
is
selected,
as
enunciated
by
our
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
have
a
direct
substantial
relationship
to
the
concept
of
the
safety
and
the
welfare
sought
to
be
attained
in
the
affirmance
of
this
particular
case
here.
if
we
consider
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
that
he
gave
his
opinion
in
connection
with
this
matter,
the
trial
judge
made
these
remarks:
i
am
a
great
believer
of
the
personal
rights
propounded
by
our
supreme
court,
reiterated
and
reaffirmed,
neglected
over
the
years
and
given
to
us
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
other
amendments
of
the
constitution.
secondly,
the
trial
court
said,
at
the
same
time,
a
police
officer
cannot,
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
and
will
not
be
permitted
to
stop
and
frisk
an
individual
simply
because
he
has
a
suspicion
--
a
mere
suspicion
--
unless
there
are
reasonable
circumstances
justifying
the
frisk.
three.
when
the
circumstances
justify,
and
there
is
reasonable
suspicion,
and
for
his
own
personal
protection,
he
may
frisk
to
determine
if
there
are
weapons
for
his
personal
safety.
four.
the
officer
assigned
in
the
area
in
which
he
had
been
placed,
doing
the
job
he
had
been
doing,
and
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
and
to
suspect
that
the
defendants
were
conducting
themselves
suspiciously
and
some
interrogation
should
be
made
of
their
action.
five.
there
was
reasonable
cause
in
this
case
for
the
officer
to
approach
these
individuals
and
pat
them
down.
here
is
a
decided
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
equate
and
balance
the
rights
of
the
individuals
with
the
rights
of
the
public
and
the
safety
that
is
involved
herein
as
it
pertains
to
the
officer
in
this
particular
case.
what
are
the
reasonable
cause
--
circumstances
that
existed
in
the
mind
of
the
officer
at
that
particular
time?
one,
we
have
a
police
officer
in
his
particular
area,
on
duty,
and
his
duty
is
to
maintain
law
and
order.
his
duty,
too,
is
to
prevent
crime
if
he
can
so
do.
secondly,
he
has
39
years
of
experience
herein.
fourth,
the
observations
of
the
suspicious
activity
which
he
observed,
which
may
be
determined
as
pre-detention
conduct.
five,
he
concludes
from
the
observations
and
the
conduct
of
these
men
that
a
crime
of
violence
with
the
use
of
weapons
in
probability
may
be
committed
under
these
circumstances.
sixth,
he
decides
to
investigate
and
to
interrogate,
and
the
record
indicates
and
shows
that
at
this
particular
time,
why
did
you
go
over
to
these
men?
i
went
over
to
them
to
ask
them
some
questions.
eight,
when
he
asked
their
names,
he
received
this
mumbled
incoherent
response,
which
further
gave
rise
to
the
circumstances
that
he
had
concluded
previously
that
a
stick-up
was
possible
here.
at
this
point,
taking
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
he
has
concluded
--
a
stick-up
--
and
the
use
of
weapons
as
they
are
characteristically
used
in
a
stick-up,
there
is
only
one
course
of
conduct
then
open
to
a
prudent
police
officer.
and
that
is,
to
frisk
or
pat
for
weapons,
for
the
protection
of
his
life.
this
is
why
we
considered
it
in
the
interest
of
safety
and
public
welfare
in
the
state
of
ohio.
seven
--
or,
not
seven,
but
--
ten,
there
was
the
absence
of
assistance
to
this
officer,
at
this
time,
in
relation
to
the
number
of
individuals
involved
here.
there
was
one
police
officer
and
three
men.
the
type
of
clothing,
also,
he
considered
at
this
particular
time
because
they
were
wearing
overcoats,
and
the
possibility
that
they
might
have
concealed
weapons,
as
they
did
exist
here;
the
sex
of
the
subjects,
also,
i
think
he
had
to
take
into
consideration,
at
this
particular
time.
there
were
three
agile,
young
men
that
he
was
confronting,
and
he
was
by
himself
at
this
particular
time.
under
these
circumstances
that
he
was
confronted
with
at
this
time,
i
believe
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
public
safety;
i
believe
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
society,
that
he
have
the
right,
based
on
these
probable
cause
circumstances,
to
frisk
this
man,
to
temporarily
detain
him,
to
ascertain
that
which
he
has
observed,
and
to
confiscate
any
weapons
which
he
may
find
on
his
person
at
that
particular
time;
and,
that
they
are
admissible
in
the
evidence
of
his
trial
subsequent
thereto.
i
think
that
if,
as
the
question
was
placed
by
one
of
the
justices
of
the
court,
that
after
the
probable
cause
that
exists
here
in
this
particular
case,
i
feel
that
the
judgment
in
the
case
should
be
affirmed.
