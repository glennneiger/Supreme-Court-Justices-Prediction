he
said
what?
i
didn't
like--?
justice

black
what
was
his
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
like
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
had
he
been
observing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
had
in
my
mind
was
this,
i
can
understand
why
you
have
a
difference
of
words,
this
scale
a
little
below.
i
can't,
myself,
see
any
difference
in,
i'm
talking
about
conduct,
in
having
a
reasonable
suspicion
something
is
about
to
be
done,
and
in
having
probable
cause
to
believe
something
is
about
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
probable
cause
to
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wait
a
second.
probable
cause
to
believe
something
will
happen.
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me,
in
your
language
--
plain
ordinary
language
--
what
you
understand
to
be
meant
when
somebody
says,
for
that
reason,
says
that
a
thing
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
something
will
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
it
to
mean
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
something
is
going
to
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
mean,
does
it,
that
it's
bound
to
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you've
got
to
have
something
that
is
‘‘reasonable
grounds''
for
saying
you
believe
it
will
happen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
see
it,
what
you
and
your
case
are
really
substantially
arguing
is
that
to
stop
a
man,
or
to
ask
him
a
question
by
an
officer,
is
not
an
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment
description
of
an
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
real
basis
of
your
argument.
what
you're
talking
about
is
an
arrest,
and
you're
saying
it
doesn't
arrest
him
to
ask
him
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
imagine
you're
saying,
also,
it
doesn't
necessarily
arrest
him
to
touch
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
an
assault,
but
not
an
arrest,
under
the
constitutional
meaning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
hasn't
taken
him
into
custody,
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is,
under
an
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
deny
he
was
arrested;
you're
arguing
about
what
time
before
he
was
arrested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
between
seizure
and
arrest?
you
know,
a
seizure
--
you
don't
seize
a
man
--
i
mean,
you
may
seize
him
because
you
seize
something
tangible,
but
that's
not
what
you
are
talking
about
in
a
seizure
in
the
fourth
amendment.
i
thought
it
was
an
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
officer
could
very
easily
turn
a
man
around,
without
arresting
him,
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
be
easy,
depending
on
his
size
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
undoubtedly
did
this
when
he
ordered
them
to
get
into
the
store
and
turn
their
palms
towards
the
wall
and
stand
there.
at
that
point,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
an
arrest,
i
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
if
this
is
not
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
hold
--
i'm
not
saying
we
shouldn't.
you
ask
us
to
hold,
as
i
understand
it,
that
no
officer
has
a
right
to
interrogate
people,
and
expect
to
get
an
answer,
unless
he
already
has
in
his
possession,
or
in
his
mind,
evidence
sufficient
to
show
probable
cause
that
that
person
has
committed
a
crime,
or
is
about
to
commit
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
far
would
you
take
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
asking
him
questions
and
expecting
him
to
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
has
a
right
to
expect
an
answer,
and
to
do
anything
whatever
if
he
doesn't
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
policeman
does
not
have
the
right
to
ask
a
person
a
question
on
the
street
and
get
an
answer,
or
to
keep
him,
or
do
anything
else
except
just
ask
him
a
question,
unless
he's
in
possession
of
sufficient
facts
to
know
that
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
man
has
committed
a
crime
or
is
about
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said,
can
ask
him
a
question,
but
cannot
get
an
answer,
and
do
nothing
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can
arrest
him.
but
supposing
he
doesn't
choose
to
arrest
him?
suppose
he
wants
to
do
something
short
of
arresting
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
man
can
go
on
and
off,
not
answer
the
question
because
the
officer
doesn't
have
at
that
time
a
sufficient
amount
of
evidence
to
make
a
case
of
probable
cause
that
he
has
committed
a
crime?
justice

i
thought
that
was
it.
