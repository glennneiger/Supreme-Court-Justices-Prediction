justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
stating
again,
what
was
the
qualification
of
the
examiner?
justice
abe
fortas
was
further
evidence
taken
on
remand?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
the
next
go
around,
the
court
did
criticize
the
commission
for
not
taking
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
additional
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
that
frequently
happens
to
lawyers.
justice
abe
fortas
so
i
don’t
want
to
disrupt
your
plan
or
order
of
argument
but
i
would
like
to
hear
your
views
as
to
what
i
consider
in
a
way
to
be
the
determinative
factors
in
the
court’s
opinions
and
i
don’t
gather
that
there
is
any
extensive
quarrel
about
facts
of
the
merits
of
this
thing
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
says
is,
number
1,
maritime
commission
applied
the
wrong
standard.
that’s
in
the
first
opinion
that
it
gave
excessive
weight
to
what
it
considered
to
be
empty
competitive
factors;
and
no.
2,
that
the
board’s
technique
here
was
insupportable.
that’s
in
the
both
the
first
and
the
second
opinion,
that
is
to
say
that
the
board
failed
to
set
out
findings
based
upon
evidence,
which
fit
in
with
the
standard
of
the
act.
now,
those,
as
i
look
at
the
commission’s
opinions,
both
it’s
first
opinion
and
its
opinion
on
remand
--
those
positions
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
certainly
arguable
and
they
don’t
have
to
go
back
into
the
whole
question
of
the
practices
of
the
industry
to
assess
them
as
--
you
had
your
--
they
were
different
panels,
weren’t
the
only
judge
danaher
said
on
both
of
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
had
five
different
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
who
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
and
that
conclusion,
whatever
the
detailed
reasons
being,
there
were
really
as
i
read
this
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
just
didn’t
do
its
job
in
terms
of
writing
and
in
terms
of
setting
code,
the
findings
required
by
the
act
in
terms
of
the
analytical
and
craftsmanship
for
part
of
the
responsibility
of
an
administrative
agency
where
upon
which
our
administrative
jurisprudence
is
based
and
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
want
to
burden
you
and
just
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
you
appreciate
somebody
talking
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
are
not
conceding,
are
you
that
if
the
commission
concluded
that
this
was
anticompetitive
and
there
were
no
off
setting
virtue,
you
don’t
concede
that
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
not
have
power
to
outlaw
the
rule
under
public
interest
standard
of
the
statute,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
have
i
made
myself
clear?
the
commission
finds
that
a
particular
rule
is
anticompetitive.
the
commission
finds
that
there
are
no
off
setting
advantages.
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
government’s
position
that
the
commission
could
then
make
a
finding
that
the
rule
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore,
violative
of
the
standards
of
the
act?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
have
to
look
at
theory
as
you
know.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
then
on
the
second
part
of
the
case,
and
i
take
it
that
the
counsel
will
deal
with
that,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
it’s
not
the
court’s
function
the
right
findings.
justice
abe
fortas
it’s
the
administrative
agency’s
function
to
write
findings.
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
court,
these
two
panels
made
quite
a
point
what
they
considered
to
be
of
a
commission’s
failure
to
make
findings
which
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
failure
of
craftsmanship
but
there
may
be
a
small
desist
but
favor.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would
take
--
as
far
as
it
me
as
i
got
opinions
of
courts
here,
sir,
and
they
say
that
there
were
no
findings
that
could
support
this
regulation
or
this
determination
under
the
act
and
i
wish
you
would
please
tell
me
what
the
findings
were
and
then
let
me
know
how
you
feel
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
do
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
act,
as
to
my
mind,
that’s
the
issue.
it’s
true
that
your
adversary
argues
that
there
wasn’t
substantial
evidence
but
primarily
where
we
first
have
to
look
at.
that
is
what
the
court
said
on
why
they
were
wrong
if
they
were?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
insisting
on
findings
by
the
administrative
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
the
burden
is
on
the
shipping
companies
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
the
carriers
--
follow
my
brother
white’s
questioning,
suppose
the
carriers
got
together
and
they
adopted
the
rule
to
the
effect
that
none
of
the
carriers
will
transport
steel
unless
it
was
made
by
united
states
steel,
a
single
carrier.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
adopted
such
a
rule
and
then
the
commission
started
a
proceeding,
the
commission
challenged
that
rule,
and
started
a
proceeding
in
which
a
staff
challenged
that
rule
on
the
grounds
that,
it
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
is
it
your
position
that
they
would
have
to
come
forward
with
proof
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
or
with
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
the
burden
of
proof
as
a
substantive
matter
in
those
circumstances
be
on
the
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
alright
but
similarly,
if
change
of
facts
and
the
carriers
come
forward
with
some
other
rule
that
on
conventional
theories
of
competition,
it
appears
to
be
anticompetitive
and
perhaps
therefore
in
the
lexicon
or
folklore
anyway,
perhaps
of
our
jurisprudence
and
therefore
contrary
to
public
interest.
isn’t
the
burden
of
going
forward
on
the
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
quite
your
substantial
evidence
turns
and
pried
upon
who
has
a
burden
of
going
forward.
i
mean
that
that’s
no
answer
to
it
and
i
respectfully
suggest
because
the
question
is;
who
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
producing
evidence
at
each
point
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
start
off
with
the
rule
and
then
as
evidence
is
submitted
at
each
point
as
evidence
is
submitted,
the
question
of
burden
is
relevant
and
may
be
critical
on
the
question
of
substantial
--
on
the
issue
of
substantial
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
in
the
industry
in
this
nation
that
has
such
a
franchise?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
get
around
the
reading
this
court’s
central
opinion,
i
think
you’ll
find
some
statements
on
that
subject
that
is
to
say
that
--
to
the
effect
that
where
there
is
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust,
from
our
usual
antitrust
philosophy
that
there
is
a
necessity
of
looking
at
the
practice
and
why
it
is
accepted
that
in
that
context
in
any
event,
private
agreements
are
not
to
be
accepted
without
any
inquiry.
justice
abe
fortas
railroads
aren’t
subject
to
the
ordinary
antitrust
rules
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
without
these
travel
agent
rules
these
conferences
would
go
out
of
existence?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
travel
agent
rule
is
unimportant
to
the
conference?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
it’s
a
violation
of
law
i
suppose
you
would
agree
it’s
a
violation
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
it’s
a
violation
of
shipping
act,
it’s
a
violation
of
the
shipping
trade?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
conference
will
go
out
of
existence,
are
you
making
that
representation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
conference
also
regulates
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you’re
saying
to
us
is
that
if
we
don’t,
that
if
we
don’t
validate
the
order
of
the
court
below
despite
the
other
powers
and
functions
of
the
conference,
the
conference
will
go
out
of
existence?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
didn’t
include
of
a
passenger
conference.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that’s
control
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
passenger
fares.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
if
you
look
at
this
in
terms
of
conventional,
anti-trust
law
or
conventional
law
with
reference
to
statutory
scheme,
and
look
at
it
as,
from
my
point
of
view,
cartel
law
and
certainly,
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction
to
fly
it’s
laws,
a)
to
its
own
citizens;
b)
to
foreign
persons
doing
business
here.
justice
abe
fortas
it’s
power
would
extend
to
exercising
that
jurisdiction
over
cartel
aspects
of
it
and
you
are
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
because
of
the
foreign
participation
in
this
conference,
the
united
states
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
or
to
abolish
a
cartel
agreement
with
respect
to
the
fees
to
be
paid,
restricting
fees
to
be
paid
to
travel
agents
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
agree.
that’s
perfectly
clear,
perfectly
clean
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
industry
is
governed
like
any
other
industry
in
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
and
the
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
it
has
no
general,
this
industry,
it
has
no
general
exemption
from
the
united
states
laws
except
as
expressly
set
forth
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
this
in
its
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
obviously,
sir.
you
know
that
i’m
talking
about
this
industry
and
so
far
as
it’s
actions
in
the
united
states
are
concerned.
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
right
here.
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
right
here
and
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
you
don’t
get
around
it
by
talking
about
foreign
participation
and
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
what
would
otherwise,
apart
from
what
is
permitted
by
the
statute
constitute
a
cartel
arrangement
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
travel
agents
from
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
abe
fortas
i
follow
your
argument
on
this,
i
don’t
follow
your
argument
that
seems
to
indicate
some
special
immunity
here
but
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
abe
fortas
other
than
what
is
specified
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
this
domestic
u.s.a.
activity.
justice
abe
fortas
but
didn’t
the
commission
on
the
remand
proceedings
limit
those
proceedings
to
the
filing
of
briefs
in
oral
argument
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
judgment
533
(a)
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
that
appear?
as
i
read
the
bottom
of
533
(h)
and
the
commission
said,
“we
ordered
reopening
of
the
proceeding
on
the
remanded
issues
and
the
reopening
was
limited
to
the
filing
of
briefs
and
oral
argument
by
other
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
the
commission
never
said
anything
contrary
to
--
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
stating
again,
what
was
the
qualification
of
the
examiner?
justice
abe
fortas
was
further
evidence
taken
on
remand?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
the
next

the

did
criticize
the

those,
as

on

--
those

carrier.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
adopted
such
a
rule
and
then
the
commission
started
a
proceeding,
the
commission
challenged
that
rule,
and
started
a
proceeding
in
which
a
staff
challenged
that
rule
on
the
grounds
that,
it
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
is
it
your
position
that
they
would
have
to
come
forward
with
proof
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
or
with
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
the
burden
of
proof
as
a
substantive
matter
in
those
circumstances
be
on
the
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
alright
but
similarly,
if
change
of
facts
and
the
carriers
come
forward
with
some
other
rule
that
on
conventional
theories
of
competition,
it
appears
to
be
anticompetitive
and
perhaps
therefore
in
the
lexicon
or
folklore
anyway,
perhaps
of
our
jurisprudence
and
therefore
contrary
to
public
interest.
isn’t
the
burden
of
going
forward
on
the
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
quite
your
substantial
evidence
turns
and
pried
upon
who
has
a
burden
of
going
forward.
i
mean
that
that’s
no
answer
to
it
and
i
respectfully
suggest
because
the
question
is;
who
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
producing
evidence
at
each
point
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
start
off
with
the
rule
and
then
as
evidence
is
submitted
at
each
point
as
evidence
is
submitted,
the
question
of
burden
is
relevant
and
may
be
critical
on
the
question
of
substantial
--
on
the
issue
of
substantial
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
in
the
industry
in
this
nation
that
has
such
a
franchise?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
get
around
the
reading
this
court’s
central
opinion,
i
think
you’ll
find
some
statements
on
that
subject
that
is
to
say
that
--
to
the
effect
that
where
there
is
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust,
from
our
usual
antitrust
philosophy
that
there
is
a
necessity
of
looking
at
the
practice
and
why
it
is
accepted
that
in
that
context
in
any
event,
private
agreements
are
not
to
be
accepted
without
any
inquiry.
justice
abe
fortas
railroads
aren’t
subject
to
the
ordinary
antitrust
rules
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
without
these
travel
agent
rules
these
conferences
would
go
out
of
existence?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
travel
agent
rule
is
unimportant
to
the
conference?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
it’s
a
violation
of
law
i
suppose
you
would
agree
it’s
a
violation
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
it’s
a
violation
of
shipping
act,
it’s
a
violation
of
the
shipping
trade?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
conference
will
go
out
of
existence,
are
you
making
that
representation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
conference
also
regulates
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you’re
saying
to
us
is
that
if
we
don’t,
that
if
we
don’t
validate
the
order
of
the
court
below
despite
the
other
powers
and
functions
of
the
conference,
the
conference
will
go
out
of
existence?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
didn’t
include
of
a
passenger
conference.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that’s
control
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
passenger
fares.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
if
you
look
at
this
in
terms
of
conventional,
anti-trust
law
or
conventional
law
with
reference
to
statutory
scheme,
and
look
at
it
as,
from
my
point
of
view,
cartel
law
and
certainly,
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction
to
fly
it’s
laws,
a)
to
its
own
citizens;
b)
to
foreign
persons
doing
business
here.
justice
abe
fortas
it’s
power
would
extend
to
exercising
that
jurisdiction
over
cartel
aspects
of
it
and
you
are
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
because
of
the
foreign
participation
in
this
conference,
the
united
states
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
or
to
abolish
a
cartel
agreement
with
respect
to
the
fees
to
be
paid,
restricting
fees
to
be
paid
to
travel
agents
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
agree.
that’s
perfectly
clear,
perfectly
clean
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
industry
is
governed
like
any
other
industry
in
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
and
the
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
it
has
no
general,
this
industry,
it
has
no
general
exemption
from
the
united
states
laws
except
as
expressly
set
forth
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
this
in
its
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
obviously,
sir.
you
know
that
i’m
talking
about
this
industry
and
so
far
as
it’s
actions
in
the
united
states
are
concerned.
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
right
here.
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
right
here
and
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
--
and
you
don’t
get
around
it
by
talking
about
foreign
participation
and
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
what
would
otherwise,
apart
from
what
is
permitted
by
the
statute
constitute
a
cartel
arrangement
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
travel
agents
from
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
abe
fortas
i
follow
your
argument
on
this,
i
don’t
follow
your
argument
that
seems
to
indicate
some
special
immunity
here
but
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
abe
fortas
other
than
what
is
specified
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
this
domestic
u.s.a.
activity.
justice
abe
fortas
but
didn’t
the
commission
on
the
remand
proceedings
limit
those
proceedings
to
the
filing
of
briefs
in
oral
argument
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
judgment
533
(a)
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
that
appear?
as
i
read
the
bottom
of
533
(h)
and
the
commission
said,
“we
ordered
reopening
of
the
proceeding
on
the
remanded
issues
and
the
reopening
was
limited
to
the
filing
of
briefs
and
oral
argument
by
other
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
the
commission
never
said
anything
contrary
to
--
