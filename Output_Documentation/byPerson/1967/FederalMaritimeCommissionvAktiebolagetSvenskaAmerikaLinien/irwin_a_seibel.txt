mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
which
reversed
in
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
issued
under
section
15
of
shipping
act.
the
order
required
two
closely
interrelated
trans-atlantic
steamship
passenger
conferences
to
modify
certain
provisions
of
their
conference
agreements.
the
proceedings
in
which
the
commission’s
order
was
entered
were
triggered
by
a
complaint
filed
by
the
american
society
of
travel
agents,
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
complaining
about
certain
practices
of
the
conferences
and
requesting
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
travel
agents
and
the
conferences.
this
was
the
first
comprehensive
investigation
undertaken
by
the
commission
of
this
relationship
since
the
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
in
1916.
the
two
conferences
here
involved
are
informed
distinct
legal
entities
though
they
are
closely
coordinated
and
they
determine
the
uniform
practices
and
policies
for
their
member
lines
including
the
fixing
of
transportation
fares,
the
fixing
of
commissions
paid
to
their
travel
agents
and
also
the
selection,
supervision
and
control
of
the
agents
they
appoint.
one
of
the
conferences
is
responsible
for
fixing
the
fares
and
the
commissions
for
the
travel
agents
and
the
other
is
responsible
generally
for
picking
the
travel
agents
and
seeing
to
it
that
they
stay
in
line;
that
they
observe
the
proper
conference
rules.
membership
in
each
conference
is
identical
or
almost
identical,
each
consisting
of
the
same
25
lines
with
one
unimportant
exception.
seven
of
the
lines
do
not
serve
the
ports
of
the
united
states
or
at
least
very
minimally.
the
conference
lines
carry
99%,
99%
of
all
the
trans-atlantic
passengers
going
by
ship.
they
obtain
most
of
this
traffic
through
the
travel
agents
they
appoint.
typically,
these
agents
account
for
about
75%
to
80%
of
all
the
tickets
sold
in
the
united
states
for
trans-atlantic
steamship
passage.
these
agents
almost
always
also
serve
as
agents
for
airlines.
after
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
the
commission’s
examiner
recommended
disapproval
of
certain
provisions
and
of
certain
practices
of
the
conference.
among
those
disapproved
was
the
so-called
“tying-rule”.
this
is
a
rule
which
forbids
the
travel
agents
under
penalty
of
disqualification
from
serving
any
competing
non-conference
steamship
line.
in
other
words,
it
ties
the
agents
to
the
conference
members.
the
other
rule,
the
“unanimity
rule”,
so-called
is
one
the
examiner
did
not
recommend
be
disapproved.
this
is
a
rule
which
requires
the
agreement
of
all
the
member
lines,
all
25
member
lines
before
any
change
can
be
made
in
the
level
of
commissions
payable
to
the
travel
agents.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
indeed.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
almost
always.
i
think
the
provisions
have
probably
been
in
the
conference
agreement
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
conferences
and
perhaps.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
exactly!
they
have.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
this
had
been
approved
in
the
course
of
the
non-adversary
proceeding.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
no.
i’m
representing
the
maritime
commission
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
if
mr.
(inaudible)
that
way.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
the
travel
agents
filed
a
petition
and
in
response
to
that
petition,
the
commission
undertook
its
own
investigation.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
now
the
travel
agent,
instead
of
recommending
the
disapproval
of
this
so-called
“unanimity
rule”
recommended
only
that
the
seven
conference
lines
who
do
not
serve
the
united
states
ports
and
therefore,
derived
little
of
any
business
from
travel
agents
from
the
united
states
not
be
permitted
to
vote
on
the
rates
of
commission
payable
to
the
travel
agents.
the
commission
with
two
commissioners
dissenting
upheld
the
examiner’s
disapproval
of
the
tying-rule,
rule
which
ties
the
agents
to
the
member
lines.
the
commission,
however,
disagreed
with
the
examiner’s
qualified
acceptance
of
the
unanimity
rule.
it
held
that
the
unanimity
rule
had
prevented
a
majority
of
the
conference
lines
from
increasing
the
commission
rates
and
as
a
consequence,
put
the
conference
lines
at
a
disadvantage
in
competing
with
the
airlines
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
examiner
did
not
recommend
disapproval
of
the
unanimity
rule.
he
recommended
disapproval
of
the
tying
rule
but
not
the
unanimity
rule.
he
said
that
he
recommended
that
the
seven
lines,
seven
member
lines
who
do
not
serve
the
united
states
ports
not
be
permitted
to
vote.
the
commission
on
the
other
hand
disapproved
both
rules
but
did
permit
the
seven
lines
to
vote,
indicating
it
had
no
objection
to
their
having
some
voice
in
the
voting.
it
ordered
the
elimination
of
the
rule
indicating
that
once
the
veto
power
of
the
lines
not
serving
the
united
states
was
eliminated,
they
could
have
some
voice
in
the
voting.
on
review,
the
first
time
came
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
set
aside
the
order
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
with
respect
to
the
tying
rule,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
had
failed
expressly
to
find
that
that
rule
offended
one
of
the
four
criteria
set
forth
on
the
statute,
namely
that,
it
was
not
on
a
fir
or
unjustly
discriminatory
as
between
carriers,
detrimental
of
the
commerce
in
the
united
states’
contrary
of
public
interest
or
otherwise
in
violation
of
the
act.
and,
the
court
also
noted
that
the
commission
had
apparently
rested
it’s
disapproval
on
the
ground
exclusively
on
antitrust
principles
and
pointed
out
to
the
commission
that
it
must
measure
its
disapproval
against
one
of
the
four
criteria
set
forth
in
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
had
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
that
it
was
the
rule
which
contributed
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
conference
members
in
competing
with
the
airlines
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
it
also
said
that
a
mere
showing
that
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
the
conference
members
had
temporarily
blocked
or
even
permanently
blocked
the
conference
from
acting,
was
not
sufficient
under
the
statute
in
its
view
to
invalidate
the
rule.
the
court
then
directed
the
commission
to
either
make
adequately
--
supported
ultimate
findings
to
justify
disapproval
or
to
approve
the
rule
and
no
certiorari
was
sought
from
that
position.
the
commission
then
considered
the
matter
on
remand.
and
on
remand,
the
commission
reanalyzed
the
evidence
and
made
extensive
findings.
it
fully
set
forth
the
rationale
underlying
its
application
of
section
15
of
the
act
to
these
agreements.
it
recognized
that
the
section
15
was
intended
to
condone
some
anticompetitive
agreements,
obviously,
it
granted
an
exemption
once
the
agreements
have
been
approved.
but
in
the
commission’s
view,
the
statute
did
not
represent
a
total
abandonment
of
the
antitrust
concepts.
in
its
view,
anticompetitive
arrangements,
which
are
more
restrictive
than
necessary
to
serve
some
legitimate
shipping
act
purpose;
should
not
be
approved.
it
then
turned
to
a
consideration
of
both
of
the
rules
and
again,
disapproved
both
expressly
finding
that
both
are
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
your
honor,
the
court
had
not
suggested
that
further
evidence
be
taken
and
nobody
before
the
commission
expressed
their
willingness
to
--
the
parties
submitted
additional
briefs
and
re-argued
the
issues
before
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
all
of
us
were
surprised
that
finding
that
criticism
but.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
commission
found
that
the
tying
rule,
the
rule
that
ties
the
agents
to
the
conference
lines
and
forbids
them
from
selling
to
competing
non-conference
lines,
was
seriously
more
anticompetitive
than
was
necessary
to
served
any
legitimate
shipping
act
function.
it
was
more
than
necessary
to
secure
any
public
benefit
or
a
transportation
need.
it
said
that
the
tying
rule
imposed
harsh
restraints
on
three
distinct
interests
entitled
to
protection.
the
independent
non-conference
freighters
who
accounted
for
the
remaining
one
percent
of
the
trade,
trans-atlantic
passenger
trade,
were
denied
access
to
the
4,000
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
who
accounted
for
some
80%
of
all
the
trans-atlantic
passenger
business.
the
traveling
public
was
denied
the
access
to
the
valuable
service
of
the
conference
travel
agents
if
they
wish
to
go
on
non-conference
vessel
and
the
travel
agents
themselves,
appointed
by
the
conference,
were
denied
the
opportunity
of
serving
a
client
who
wished
to
go
on
a
conference.
the
court
then
examined
the
various
justifications
which
were
advanced
by
the
conferences
and
found
them
unsatisfactory
and
then
disapproved
the
rule.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
court
of
appeals
on
it’s
first
opinion,
remanded
it
to
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
second
opinion,
it
reversed
and
did
not
remand.
instead,
it
entered
a
simple
judgment
of
reversal.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
have
not
challenged
it
because
we
thought
it
would
be
destruction.
we
think
what
they’ve
done
is
so
clearly
mistaken.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
this
case
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
we
think
this
case
--
i’m
not
agreeing
with
that,
your
honor.
however,
this
case
has
been
--
was
started
almost
ten
years
ago
and
i
think
the
parties
exhausted
themselves,
exhausted
all
the
material
but
make
a
win
so
that
i’m
not
sure
that
it
would
avail
anything
to
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
don’t
think
the
court
has
a
right
to
end
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
have
sent
it
back
to
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
it
is
but
the
result
of
its
action
is
to
end
the
case,
however.
it
said
it
would
not
remand
to
the
commission.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule,
the
commission
found
that
the
one
used
by
the
conference
existed
in
its
most
stultifying
form,
it
could
not
be
changed
except
the
unanimity
rule
itself
relating
to
the
commissions
payable
for
the
agents
could
not
be
changed
except
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
all
the
members.
in
addition,
it
did
not
have
a
definite
time
limit
at
the
expiration
of
which,
the
rates
would
have
to
be
reset
so
that
if
--
and
the
members
would
not
be
free
to
disagree.
in
other
words,
the
previously
made
rates
remain
frozen
and
could
not
be
changed
except
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
all
the
members.
in
examining
the
rule
in
actual
operation,
the
commission
noted
the
difficulties
in
assessing
the
effects
of
the
rule
because
of
the
conference’s
failure
to
keep
complete
minutes
of
its
meetings
as
required.
it
observed
that
the
abbreviated
minutes
kept
by
the
conference,
failed
to
disclose
the
agenda,
the
votes
of
the
members,
the
discussion
of
the
members
or
any
proposal
which
was
not
adopted
by
the
conference.
nevertheless,
on
the
basis
of
such
evidence
as
was
available,
such
as
the
records
of
an
individual
conference
line
or
the
testimony
of
officials
of
individual
members
of
the
line,
the
commission
found
that
but
for
the
unanimity
rule,
a
majority
of
the
conference
members,
would
have
raised
the
commissions
and
that
their
failure
to
do
so
had
put
the
conferences
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
with
the
airlines
in
competing
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
the
point
the
commission
made
was
that,
had
the
majority
wished
to
increase
the
commissions
to
their
travel
agents,
this
might
have
offset
the
tendency
of
the
travel
agents
to
push
airline
bookings.
since
the
conferences
are
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
present
commissions
are
7%
on
point
to
point
bookings
and
10%
on
tourist
package.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
airlines
pay
the
same
amount
now,
your
honor.
however,
during
the
period
which
the
commission
examined
a
strong
majority
of
the
conference
lines
back
in
1950,
wanted
to
raise
the
commissions
to
an
amount
which
would
have
been
above
the
level
paid
by
the
travel
agents.
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
wanted
to
go
to
7
½%,
from
6%
to
7
½%
covering
all
seasons,
both
the
slack
season
and
the
summer
season
and
the
commission
found
that
it
took
them
--
because
of
this
rule,
it
took
the
conferences
at
least
six
years
to
go
to
increase
the
level
of
the
commissions
to
7%.
and
at
the
end
of
13
years,
when
the
proceeding
had
closed,
the
conferences
had
still
not
raised
the
commission
rates
to
the
level
which
a
majority
had
favored
back
in
1950.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
travel
agents.
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
in
canada
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
commission
was
aware
that
it
took
a
lot
more
time
of
the
travel
agents
to
book
steamship
passage
than
airlines
and
therefore
pointed
out
even
though
the
rates
of
commission
ultimately
--
the
rates
of
commission
pay
travel
agents
for
the
steamship
lines
ultimately
was
on
the
same
level
as
the
airlines,
the
effective
level
of
the
commission
because
of
the
extra
time
was
lower.
and
even
though
the
agents
may
have
felt
a
degree
of
loyalty
to
the
steamship
lines
whom
they’ve
served
for
many,
many
years,
there
was
a
tendency
nevertheless
to
push
airline
travel
and
the
commission
felt
had
a
majority
wish
to
increase
this
beyond
the
one
they
should
be
allowed
the
opportunity.
in
addition,
the
commission
did
point
out
that
another
ground
that
a
rule
which
ties
up
a
major
industry
and
prevents
it
from
responding
readily
to
changes
in
market
conditions
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
it
shouldn’t
be
permitted
to
continue.
the
commission
did
not
simply
order
the
elimination
of
this
rule
without
requiring
them
to,
without
saying
they
had
to
have
by
simple
majority
or
even
requiring
them
to
have
a
unanimity
rule
which
existed
in
a
less
rigid
form,
for
example,
a
rule
that
might
last
for
only
two
years
once
they
set
the
travel
agents
commission.
at
the
end
of
that
period,
they
are
free
to
--
i
must
agree
again
on
a
different
level.
and
if
they’re
unable
to
agree,
perhaps,
each
one
may
be
free
to
set
its
own
rates.
but
note
that
that
was
not
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
rule
in
its
most
rigid
form.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
did
not
exercise
that
power,
it
ordered
them
to
eliminate
this
particular
rule.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
such
evidence
as
was
available
or
evidence
was
rather
sketchy,
as
the
commission
pointed
out,
and
it
was
difficult
for
it
to
assess
the
effects
of
the
rule
in
actual
operation
but
there
was
evidence
--
some
of
it
obtained
from
the
files
of
the
individual
members
of
the
line,
which
showed
that
in
1950,
for
example,
where
the
majority
was
in
favor
of
increasing
it;
a
strong
majority.
another
record
shows
that
a
change
in
the
rates
was
prevented
because
unanimity
could
not
be
achieved.
the
records
of
one
member
line
further
showed
that
in
early
1956,
only
one
line
was
responsible
for
resisting
a
change
to
a
different
level
in
the
commission
rate.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
these
bits
of
evidence,
taking
into
consideration
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
evidence
because
of
the
sketchiness
of
the
conference’
minutes
that
the
commission
felt
that
it
was
justified
in
ruling
as
it
did
in
ordering
the
elimination
of
the
rule.
however,
the
other
ground
for
eliminating
the
rule
was
that,
this
rule
existed
in
its
most
unabated
form,
that
is
that
it
didn’t
have
a
definite
time
period
in
contrast
to
a
rule
in
the
airline
industry,
which
had
a
definite
period
of
time
when
the
members
of
the
industry
had
to
reset
their
rates
and
if
they
couldn’t
agree
unanimously
why
each
was
free
to
set
his
own
rate.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
there
are
22
foreign
lines
in
one
and
23
foreign
lines
in
the
other.
in
other
words,
three
and
two,
three
american
lines
and
one
and
two
in
the
other.
i
should
like
to
turn
to
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
regarding
the
integrity
of
these
rules.
as
one
argument
advanced
by
the
conference
is
that
these
rules
have
been
in
conference
agreements
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
conference
system
back
at
the
last
quarter
of
the
19th
century,
even
before
the
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
and
that
the
commission
had
approved
these
rules
many
years
ago
and,
therefore,
it
shouldn’t
have
disapproved
the
rules.
now,
in
this
proceeding,
i
think
the
--
really
the
short
answer
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
clear.
and
if
i
may
call
your
honors’
attention
to
it,
it
appears
on
page
3
of
the
government’s
brief
or
the
relevant
language
to
which
i
am
referring.
in
the
first
full
paragraph
at
page
3
is
a
portion
of
section
15,
and
i
will
skip
the
irrelevant
portion
as
i
read;
the
section
that
directs
the
commission
to
disapprove
any
agreement
and
i
skip
to
the
fourth
line,
and
read,
“whether
or
not
previously
approved
by
it”.
so
the
statute
makes
an
amply
clear
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
and
indeed
it
must
disapprove
an
agreement
whether
or
not
previously
disapprove
that
it
finds
offense
of
one
of
the
four
statutory
criteria
and
of
course,
the
commission
did
that
here.
i
should
like
now
to
deal
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
agreement
is
the
conference
agreement
but
i’m
sure
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
i
don’t
have
any
difficulty,
that’s
always
been
accepted.
i’m
sure
the
conference
would
prefer
to
have
the
provision
disapprove
rather
than
the
entire
agreement
because
they
can
still
fix.
the
fixing
of
rates,
of
course,
the
transportation
fares
is
not
at
all
in
question
here.
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
tying
rule
was.
and
what
the
rule
comes
down
to
is
that,
it’s
an
agreement
among
the
conference
lines
that
the
agent,
any
agent
of
any
member
may
not
serve
a
competing
non-conference
line
on
penalty
of
being
disqualified
from
serving
all
conference
lines.
in
other
words,
the
rule
is
in
effect
an
agreement
to
boycott
any
agent
who
doesn’t
deal
exclusively
with
the
conference
members.
now,
the
commission
found
that
since
the
conferences
account
for
99%
of
all
business
in
this
trade
and
these
agents
whom
they’ve
tied
up
this
way
sell
about
80%
of
all
the
tickets,
the
restrictions
inflicted
injury
on
the
three
interests
i
had
mentioned
earlier,
the
independent
non-conference
trader,
who,
like
the
conference
members,
everybody
agrees
is
highly
dependent
upon
travel
agents
for
business
is
denied
access
to
these
agents
and
generally,
are
the
best
established
and
most
successful
agents
in
the
business.
and,
of
course,
demand
the
public
in
the
hinder
land
who
wants
to
go
by
with
his
family
while
on
a
non-conference
vessel
is
likewise
denied
the
services
of
a
travel
agent.
the
travel
agents
were
tied
at
the
conference
lines
and,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
travel
agents
themselves.
those
appointed
by
the
conference
members
can’t
sell
tickets
for
clients
who
may
want
to
go
that
way.
the
commission
--
what
the
conference
says,
well
this
is
all
conjecture;
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
this
actually
happened.
no
conference
carrier
came
up
to
complain.
no
member
of
the
public
was
up
as
a
witness
and
there
really
has
not
been
any
showing
of
a
measurable
loss
by
the
travel
agents
of
any
business.
but
first,
the
short
answer
to
this
is
that
these
injuries
are
just
bound
to
occur
given
the
fact
that
80%
of
the
business
is
run
by
the
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
members.
and
surely,
the
commission
wasn’t
obliged
to
showing
that
this
restriction
was
devastatingly
effective
and
that
no
one
could
ever
find
a
way
of
traveling
by
non-conference
vessel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
does
show,
if
that
were
necessary,
that
agents
have,
the
conference
agents
have
had
to
turn
away
prospective
customers
for
non-conference
traders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
chairman
of
the
conference
himself
testified
at
pages
144
and
145
of
the
record
that
--
i’m
paraphrasing
that
he’d
been
asked
whether
he’d
been
approached
by
a
travel
agent
to
sell
or
to
allow
the
travel
agent
to
sell
tickets
for
a
family
who
wanted
to
go
on
non-conference
vessel.
he
said
in
substance,
well,
i
am
little
hazy,
i
vaguely
recall
something
like
that
but
i’m
sure
if
he
had
come
to
me,
i
would
have
said
to
him
while
i
tell
all
the
agents
that
nowhere.
we
can’t
make
any
exceptions.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
if
you
can
go
directly
to
the
non-conference
--
the
company
owing
the
non-conference
vessel
or
if
you
can
find
a
non-conference
agent,
there
are
some
travel
agents
who
are
not.
while
the
record
doesn’t
show
the
percentage
--
what
percentage
the
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
represents
of
all
the
travel
agents,
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
commission,
the
attorney
for
the
conference
lines
accepted
an
estimate
that
no
more
than
the
10%
of
all
agents
who
are
not
appointed
by
the
conference
lines.
in
other
words,
that
the
conference
agent
represents
90%
of
all
the
travel
agents
in
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i’d
say
to
that,
first
let
me
say,
your
honor,
i’m
imposing
upon
my
co-counsel’s
time,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question
and
i’m
sure
he
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
let
me
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
let
me
take
the
first
part
and
i
will
leave
to
mr.
sisk
the
balance
of
your
question.
it’s
clear,
i
think,
on
a
reading
of
the
commission’s
opinion,
the
opinion
on
remand
particularly,
that
the
commission
did
not
contrarily
--
the
suggestion
of
the
court
in
the
first
opinion,
court’s
second
opinion,
of
course,
is
very
brief
and
really
doesn’t
discuss
the
substance
of
the
case.
the
court
was
charging
the
commission
with
relying
exclusively
it
on
antitrust
principles
and
said
that’s
not
the
standard
you
applied.
under
the
shipping
act,
the
standards
are
the
ones
set
forth
on
the
statute;
you’ve
got,
to
contrary
of
the
public
interest,
you
got
to
show
it’s
detrimental
of
the
commerce
and
so
on.
now,
it’s
clear
the
commission
did
not
rely
exclusively
on
antitrust
grounds.
had
it
done
so
in
the
case
of
the
tying
rule,
here
you
had
what
was
in
effect
a
boycott,
something
illegal
per
se
under
the
antitrust
laws--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
am
not
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position
but
we
need
not
go
that
far
in
this
case,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
our
position.
in
other
words,
the
antitrust
concepts
are
very
important
part
of
the
notion
of
the
public
interest
and
this
is
the
standard
the
statute
sets
forth
and
what
the
commission
did
was
do
balancing.
of
course
had
it
not
been
required
to
do
the
balancing,
it
could
have
said
this
is
illegal
per
se
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
we
are
through.
that’s
the
end
of
the
case.
instead
of
that,
it
looked
at
the
market
conditions,
here
they
have
99%;
the
travel
agents
have
80%.
what
is
your
justification
if
examined
each
of
the
justifications
offered
by
the
conferences
found
them
unsatisfactory
--
i
have
no
time
to
deal
with
them
here
and
then
concluded
that
therefore,
this
particular
arrangement,
this
particular
anticompetitive
arrangement,
is
much
harsher
than
is
necessary
to
serve
a
legitimate
shipping
act
functions.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
think
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
your
honor,
i
think
as
mr.
sisk
will
point
out
the
commission
did
make
the
findings
and
i’m
sure
he
will
explain
that
they
were
supported.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
which
reversed
in
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
issued
under
section
15
of
shipping
act.
the
order
required
two
closely
interrelated
trans-atlantic
steamship
passenger
conferences
to
modify
certain
provisions
of
their
conference
agreements.
the
proceedings
in
which
the
commission’s
order
was
entered
were
triggered
by
a
complaint
filed
by
the
american
society
of
travel
agents,
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
complaining
about
certain
practices
of
the
conferences
and
requesting
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
travel
agents
and
the
conferences.
this
was
the
first
comprehensive
investigation
undertaken
by
the
commission
of
this
relationship
since
the
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
in
1916.
the
two
conferences
here
involved
are
informed
distinct
legal
entities
though
they
are
closely
coordinated
and
they
determine
the
uniform
practices
and
policies
for
their
member
lines
including
the
fixing
of
transportation
fares,
the
fixing
of
commissions
paid
to
their
travel
agents
and
also
the
selection,
supervision
and
control
of
the
agents
they
appoint.
one
of
the
conferences
is
responsible
for
fixing
the
fares
and
the
commissions
for
the
travel
agents
and
the
other
is
responsible
generally
for
picking
the
travel
agents
and
seeing
to
it
that
they
stay
in
line;
that
they
observe
the
proper
conference
rules.
membership
in
each
conference
is
identical
or
almost
identical,
each
consisting
of
the
same
25
lines
with
one
unimportant
exception.
seven
of
the
lines
do
not
serve
the
ports
of
the
united
states
or
at
least
very
minimally.
the
conference
lines
carry
99%,
99%
of
all
the
trans-atlantic
passengers
going
by
ship.
they
obtain
most
of
this
traffic
through
the
travel
agents
they
appoint.
typically,
these
agents
account
for
about
75%
to
80%
of
all
the
tickets
sold
in
the
united
states
for
trans-atlantic
steamship
passage.
these
agents
almost
always
also
serve
as
agents
for
airlines.
after
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
the
commission’s
examiner
recommended
disapproval
of
certain
provisions
and
of
certain
practices
of
the
conference.
among
those
disapproved
was
the
so-called
“tying-rule”.
this
is
a
rule
which
forbids
the
travel
agents
under
penalty
of
disqualification
from
serving
any
competing
non-conference
steamship
line.
in
other
words,
it
ties
the
agents
to
the
conference
members.
the
other
rule,
the
“unanimity
rule”,
so-called
is
one
the
examiner
did
not
recommend
be
disapproved.
this
is
a
rule
which
requires
the
agreement
of
all
the
member
lines,
all
25
member
lines
before
any
change
can
be
made
in
the
level
of
commissions
payable
to
the
travel
agents.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
indeed.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
almost
always.
i
think
the
provisions
have
probably
been
in
the
conference
agreement
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
conferences
and
perhaps.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
exactly!
they
have.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
this
had
been
approved
in
the
course
of
the
non-adversary
proceeding.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
no.
i’m
representing
the
maritime
commission
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
if
mr.
(inaudible)
that
way.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
the
travel
agents
filed
a
petition
and
in
response
to
that
petition,
the
commission
undertook
its
own
investigation.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
now
the
travel
agent,
instead
of
recommending
the
disapproval
of
this
so-called
“unanimity
rule”
recommended
only
that
the
seven
conference
lines
who
do
not
serve
the
united
states
ports
and
therefore,
derived
little
of
any
business
from
travel
agents
from
the
united
states
not
be
permitted
to
vote
on
the
rates
of
commission
payable
to
the
travel
agents.
the
commission
with
two
commissioners
dissenting
upheld
the
examiner’s
disapproval
of
the
tying-rule,
rule
which
ties
the
agents
to
the
member
lines.
the
commission,
however,
disagreed
with
the
examiner’s
qualified
acceptance
of
the
unanimity
rule.
it
held
that
the
unanimity
rule
had
prevented
a
majority
of
the
conference
lines
from
increasing
the
commission
rates
and
as
a
consequence,
put
the
conference
lines
at
a
disadvantage
in
competing
with
the
airlines
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
examiner
did
not
recommend
disapproval
of
the
unanimity
rule.
he
recommended
disapproval
of
the
tying
rule
but
not
the
unanimity
rule.
he
said
that
he
recommended
that
the
seven
lines,
seven
member
lines
who
do
not
serve
the
united
states
ports
not
be
permitted
to
vote.
the
commission
on
the
other
hand
disapproved
both
rules
but
did
permit
the
seven
lines
to
vote,
indicating
it
had
no
objection
to
their
having
some
voice
in
the
voting.
it
ordered
the
elimination
of
the
rule
indicating
that
once
the
veto
power
of
the
lines
not
serving
the
united
states
was
eliminated,
they
could
have
some
voice
in
the
voting.
on
review,
the
first
time
came
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
set
aside
the
order
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
with
respect
to
the
tying
rule,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
had
failed
expressly
to
find
that
that
rule
offended
one
of
the
four
criteria
set
forth
on
the
statute,
namely
that,
it
was
not
on
a
fir
or
unjustly
discriminatory
as
between
carriers,
detrimental
of
the
commerce
in
the
united
states’
contrary
of
public
interest
or
otherwise
in
violation
of
the
act.
and,
the
court
also
noted
that
the
commission
had
apparently
rested
it’s
disapproval
on
the
ground
exclusively
on
antitrust
principles
and
pointed
out
to
the
commission
that
it
must
measure
its
disapproval
against
one
of
the
four
criteria
set
forth
in
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
had
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
that
it
was
the
rule
which
contributed
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
conference
members
in
competing
with
the
airlines
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
it
also
said
that
a
mere
showing
that
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
the
conference
members
had
temporarily
blocked
or
even
permanently
blocked
the
conference
from
acting,
was
not
sufficient
under
the
statute
in
its
view
to
invalidate
the
rule.
the
court
then
directed
the
commission
to
either
make
adequately
--
supported
ultimate
findings
to
justify
disapproval
or
to
approve
the
rule
and
no
certiorari
was
sought
from
that
position.
the
commission
then
considered
the
matter
on
remand.
and
on
remand,
the
commission
reanalyzed
the
evidence
and
made
extensive
findings.
it
fully
set
forth
the
rationale
underlying
its
application
of
section
15
of
the
act
to
these
agreements.
it
recognized
that
the
section
15
was
intended
to
condone
some
anticompetitive
agreements,
obviously,
it
granted
an
exemption
once
the
agreements
have
been
approved.
but
in
the
commission’s
view,
the
statute
did
not
represent
a
total
abandonment
of
the
antitrust
concepts.
in
its
view,
anticompetitive
arrangements,
which
are
more
restrictive
than
necessary
to
serve
some
legitimate
shipping
act
purpose;
should
not
be
approved.
it
then
turned
to
a
consideration
of
both
of
the
rules
and
again,
disapproved
both
expressly
finding
that
both
are
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
your
honor,
the
court
had
not
suggested
that
further
evidence
be
taken
and
nobody
before
the
commission
expressed
their
willingness
to
--
the
parties
submitted
additional
briefs
and
re-argued
the
issues
before
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
all
of
us
were
surprised
that
finding
that
criticism
but.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
commission
found
that
the
tying
rule,
the
rule
that
ties
the
agents
to
the
conference
lines
and
forbids
them
from
selling
to
competing
non-conference
lines,
was
seriously
more
anticompetitive
than
was
necessary
to
served
any
legitimate
shipping
act
function.
it
was
more
than
necessary
to
secure
any
public
benefit
or
a
transportation
need.
it
said
that
the
tying
rule
imposed
harsh
restraints
on
three
distinct
interests
entitled
to
protection.
the
independent
non-conference
freighters
who
accounted
for
the
remaining
one
percent
of
the
trade,
trans-atlantic
passenger
trade,
were
denied
access
to
the
4,000
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
who
accounted
for
some
80%
of
all
the
trans-atlantic
passenger
business.
the
traveling
public
was
denied
the
access
to
the
valuable
service
of
the
conference
travel
agents
if
they
wish
to
go
on
non-conference
vessel
and
the
travel
agents
themselves,
appointed
by
the
conference,
were
denied
the
opportunity
of
serving
a
client
who
wished
to
go
on
a
conference.
the
court
then
examined
the
various
justifications
which
were
advanced
by
the
conferences
and
found
them
unsatisfactory
and
then
disapproved
the
rule.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
court
of
appeals
on
it’s
first
opinion,
remanded
it
to
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
second
opinion,
it
reversed
and
did
not
remand.
instead,
it
entered
a
simple
judgment
of
reversal.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
have
not
challenged
it
because
we
thought
it
would
be
destruction.
we
think
what
they’ve
done
is
so
clearly
mistaken.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
this
case
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
we
think
this
case
--
i’m
not
agreeing
with
that,
your
honor.
however,
this
case
has
been
--
was
started
almost
ten
years
ago
and
i
think
the
parties
exhausted
themselves,
exhausted
all
the
material
but
make
a
win
so
that
i’m
not
sure
that
it
would
avail
anything
to
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
don’t
think
the
court
has
a
right
to
end
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
have
sent
it
back
to
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
it
is
but
the
result
of
its
action
is
to
end
the
case,
however.
it
said
it
would
not
remand
to
the
commission.
with
respect
to
the
unanimity
rule,
the
commission
found
that
the
one
used
by
the
conference
existed
in
its
most
stultifying
form,
it
could
not
be
changed
except
the
unanimity
rule
itself
relating
to
the
commissions
payable
for
the
agents
could
not
be
changed
except
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
all
the
members.
in
addition,
it
did
not
have
a
definite
time
limit
at
the
expiration
of
which,
the
rates
would
have
to
be
reset
so
that
if
--
and
the
members
would
not
be
free
to
disagree.
in
other
words,
the
previously
made
rates
remain
frozen
and
could
not
be
changed
except
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
all
the
members.
in
examining
the
rule
in
actual
operation,
the
commission
noted
the
difficulties
in
assessing
the
effects
of
the
rule
because
of
the
conference’s
failure
to
keep
complete
minutes
of
its
meetings
as
required.
it
observed
that
the
abbreviated
minutes
kept
by
the
conference,
failed
to
disclose
the
agenda,
the
votes
of
the
members,
the
discussion
of
the
members
or
any
proposal
which
was
not
adopted
by
the
conference.
nevertheless,
on
the
basis
of
such
evidence
as
was
available,
such
as
the
records
of
an
individual
conference
line
or
the
testimony
of
officials
of
individual
members
of
the
line,
the
commission
found
that
but
for
the
unanimity
rule,
a
majority
of
the
conference
members,
would
have
raised
the
commissions
and
that
their
failure
to
do
so
had
put
the
conferences
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
with
the
airlines
in
competing
for
the
promotional
assistance
of
the
travel
agents.
the
point
the
commission
made
was
that,
had
the
majority
wished
to
increase
the
commissions
to
their
travel
agents,
this
might
have
offset
the
tendency
of
the
travel
agents
to
push
airline
bookings.
since
the
conferences
are
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
present
commissions
are
7%
on
point
to
point
bookings
and
10%
on
tourist
package.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
airlines
pay
the
same
amount
now,
your
honor.
however,
during
the
period
which
the
commission
examined
a
strong
majority
of
the
conference
lines
back
in
1950,
wanted
to
raise
the
commissions
to
an
amount
which
would
have
been
above
the
level
paid
by
the
travel
agents.
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
wanted
to
go
to
7
½%,
from
6%
to
7
½%
covering
all
seasons,
both
the
slack
season
and
the
summer
season
and
the
commission
found
that
it
took
them
--
because
of
this
rule,
it
took
the
conferences
at
least
six
years
to
go
to
increase
the
level
of
the
commissions
to
7%.
and
at
the
end
of
13
years,
when
the
proceeding
had
closed,
the
conferences
had
still
not
raised
the
commission
rates
to
the
level
which
a
majority
had
favored
back
in
1950.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
travel
agents.
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
in
canada
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
commission
was
aware
that
it
took
a
lot
more
time
of
the
travel
agents
to
book
steamship
passage
than
airlines
and
therefore
pointed
out
even
though
the
rates
of
commission
ultimately
--
the
rates
of
commission
pay
travel
agents
for
the
steamship
lines
ultimately
was
on
the
same
level
as
the
airlines,
the
effective
level
of
the
commission
because
of
the
extra
time
was
lower.
and
even
though
the
agents
may
have
felt
a
degree
of
loyalty
to
the
steamship
lines
whom
they’ve
served
for
many,
many
years,
there
was
a
tendency
nevertheless
to
push
airline
travel
and
the
commission
felt
had
a
majority
wish
to
increase
this
beyond
the
one
they
should
be
allowed
the
opportunity.
in
addition,
the
commission
did
point
out
that
another
ground
that
a
rule
which
ties
up
a
major
industry
and
prevents
it
from
responding
readily
to
changes
in
market
conditions
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
it
shouldn’t
be
permitted
to
continue.
the
commission
did
not
simply
order
the
elimination
of
this
rule
without
requiring
them
to,
without
saying
they
had
to
have
by
simple
majority
or
even
requiring
them
to
have
a
unanimity
rule
which
existed
in
a
less
rigid
form,
for
example,
a
rule
that
might
last
for
only
two
years
once
they
set
the
travel
agents
commission.
at
the
end
of
that
period,
they
are
free
to
--
i
must
agree
again
on
a
different
level.
and
if
they’re
unable
to
agree,
perhaps,
each
one
may
be
free
to
set
its
own
rates.
but
note
that
that
was
not
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
rule
in
its
most
rigid
form.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
did
not
exercise
that
power,
it
ordered
them
to
eliminate
this
particular
rule.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
such
evidence
as
was
available
or
evidence
was
rather
sketchy,
as
the
commission
pointed
out,
and
it
was
difficult
for
it
to
assess
the
effects
of
the
rule
in
actual
operation
but
there
was
evidence
--
some
of
it
obtained
from
the
files
of
the
individual
members
of
the
line,
which
showed
that
in
1950,
for
example,
where
the
majority
was
in
favor
of
increasing
it;
a
strong
majority.
another
record
shows
that
a
change
in
the
rates
was
prevented
because
unanimity
could
not
be
achieved.
the
records
of
one
member
line
further
showed
that
in
early
1956,
only
one
line
was
responsible
for
resisting
a
change
to
a
different
level
in
the
commission
rate.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
these
bits
of
evidence,
taking
into
consideration
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
evidence
because
of
the
sketchiness
of
the
conference’
minutes
that
the
commission
felt
that
it
was
justified
in
ruling
as
it
did
in
ordering
the
elimination
of
the
rule.
however,
the
other
ground
for
eliminating
the
rule
was
that,
this
rule
existed
in
its
most
unabated
form,
that
is
that
it
didn’t
have
a
definite
time
period
in
contrast
to
a
rule
in
the
airline
industry,
which
had
a
definite
period
of
time
when
the
members
of
the
industry
had
to
reset
their
rates
and
if
they
couldn’t
agree
unanimously
why
each
was
free
to
set
his
own
rate.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
there
are
22
foreign
lines
in
one
and
23
foreign
lines
in
the
other.
in
other
words,
three
and
two,
three
american
lines
and
one
and
two
in
the
other.
i
should
like
to
turn
to
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
regarding
the
integrity
of
these
rules.
as
one
argument
advanced
by
the
conference
is
that
these
rules
have
been
in
conference
agreements
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
conference
system
back
at
the
last
quarter
of
the
19th
century,
even
before
the
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
and
that
the
commission
had
approved
these
rules
many
years
ago
and,
therefore,
it
shouldn’t
have
disapproved
the
rules.
now,
in
this
proceeding,
i
think
the
--
really
the
short
answer
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
clear.
and
if
i
may
call
your
honors’
attention
to
it,
it
appears
on
page
3
of
the
government’s
brief
or
the
relevant
language
to
which
i
am
referring.
in
the
first
full
paragraph
at
page
3
is
a
portion
of
section
15,
and
i
will
skip
the
irrelevant
portion
as
i
read;
the
section
that
directs
the
commission
to
disapprove
any
agreement
and
i
skip
to
the
fourth
line,
and
read,
“whether
or
not
previously
approved
by
it”.
so
the
statute
makes
an
amply
clear
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
and
indeed
it
must
disapprove
an
agreement
whether
or
not
previously
disapprove
that
it
finds
offense
of
one
of
the
four
statutory
criteria
and
of
course,
the
commission
did
that
here.
i
should
like
now
to
deal
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
agreement
is
the
conference
agreement
but
i’m
sure
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
i
don’t
have
any
difficulty,
that’s
always
been
accepted.
i’m
sure
the
conference
would
prefer
to
have
the
provision
disapprove
rather
than
the
entire
agreement
because
they
can
still
fix.
the
fixing
of
rates,
of
course,
the
transportation
fares
is
not
at
all
in
question
here.
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
tying
rule
was.
and
what
the
rule
comes
down
to
is
that,
it’s
an
agreement
among
the
conference
lines
that
the
agent,
any
agent
of
any
member
may
not
serve
a
competing
non-conference
line
on
penalty
of
being
disqualified
from
serving
all
conference
lines.
in
other
words,
the
rule
is
in
effect
an
agreement
to
boycott
any
agent
who
doesn’t
deal
exclusively
with
the
conference
members.
now,
the
commission
found
that
since
the
conferences
account
for
99%
of
all
business
in
this
trade
and
these
agents
whom
they’ve
tied
up
this
way
sell
about
80%
of
all
the
tickets,
the
restrictions
inflicted
injury
on
the
three
interests
i
had
mentioned
earlier,
the
independent
non-conference
trader,
who,
like
the
conference
members,
everybody
agrees
is
highly
dependent
upon
travel
agents
for
business
is
denied
access
to
these
agents
and
generally,
are
the
best
established
and
most
successful
agents
in
the
business.
and,
of
course,
demand
the
public
in
the
hinder
land
who
wants
to
go
by
with
his
family
while
on
a
non-conference
vessel
is
likewise
denied
the
services
of
a
travel
agent.
the
travel
agents
were
tied
at
the
conference
lines
and,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
travel
agents
themselves.
those
appointed
by
the
conference
members
can’t
sell
tickets
for
clients
who
may
want
to
go
that
way.
the
commission
--
what
the
conference
says,
well
this
is
all
conjecture;
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
this
actually
happened.
no
conference
carrier
came
up
to
complain.
no
member
of
the
public
was
up
as
a
witness
and
there
really
has
not
been
any
showing
of
a
measurable
loss
by
the
travel
agents
of
any
business.
but
first,
the
short
answer
to
this
is
that
these
injuries
are
just
bound
to
occur
given
the
fact
that
80%
of
the
business
is
run
by
the
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
members.
and
surely,
the
commission
wasn’t
obliged
to
showing
that
this
restriction
was
devastatingly
effective
and
that
no
one
could
ever
find
a
way
of
traveling
by
non-conference
vessel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
does
show,
if
that
were
necessary,
that
agents
have,
the
conference
agents
have
had
to
turn
away
prospective
customers
for
non-conference
traders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
chairman
of
the
conference
himself
testified
at
pages
144
and
145
of
the
record
that
--
i’m
paraphrasing
that
he’d
been
asked
whether
he’d
been
approached
by
a
travel
agent
to
sell
or
to
allow
the
travel
agent
to
sell
tickets
for
a
family
who
wanted
to
go
on
non-conference
vessel.
he
said
in
substance,
well,
i
am
little
hazy,
i
vaguely
recall
something
like
that
but
i’m
sure
if
he
had
come
to
me,
i
would
have
said
to
him
while
i
tell
all
the
agents
that
nowhere.
we
can’t
make
any
exceptions.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
if
you
can
go
directly
to
the
non-conference
--
the
company
owing
the
non-conference
vessel
or
if
you
can
find
a
non-conference
agent,
there
are
some
travel
agents
who
are
not.
while
the
record
doesn’t
show
the
percentage
--
what
percentage
the
travel
agents
appointed
by
the
conference
represents
of
all
the
travel
agents,
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
commission,
the
attorney
for
the
conference
lines
accepted
an
estimate
that
no
more
than
the
10%
of
all
agents
who
are
not
appointed
by
the
conference
lines.
in
other
words,
that
the
conference
agent
represents
90%
of
all
the
travel
agents
in
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i’d
say
to
that,
first
let
me
say,
your
honor,
i’m
imposing
upon
my
co-counsel’s
time,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question
and
i’m
sure
he
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
let
me
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
let
me
take
the
first
part
and
i
will
leave
to
mr.
sisk
the
balance
of
your
question.
it’s
clear,
i
think,
on
a
reading
of
the
commission’s
opinion,
the
opinion
on
remand
particularly,
that
the
commission
did
not
contrarily
--
the
suggestion
of
the
court
in
the
first
opinion,
court’s
second
opinion,
of
course,
is
very
brief
and
really
doesn’t
discuss
the
substance
of
the
case.
the
court
was
charging
the
commission
with
relying
exclusively
it
on
antitrust
principles
and
said
that’s
not
the
standard
you
applied.
under
the
shipping
act,
the
standards
are
the
ones
set
forth
on
the
statute;
you’ve
got,
to
contrary
of
the
public
interest,
you
got
to
show
it’s
detrimental
of
the
commerce
and
so
on.
now,
it’s
clear
the
commission
did
not
rely
exclusively
on
antitrust
grounds.
had
it
done
so
in
the
case
of
the
tying
rule,
here
you
had
what
was
in
effect
a
boycott,
something
illegal
per
se
under
the
antitrust
laws--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
am
not
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position
but
we
need
not
go
that
far
in
this
case,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
our
position.
in
other
words,
the
antitrust
concepts
are
very
important
part
of
the
notion
of
the
public
interest
and
this
is
the
standard
the
statute
sets
forth
and
what
the
commission
did
was
do
balancing.
of
course
had
it
not
been
required
to
do
the
balancing,
it
could
have
said
this
is
illegal
per
se
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
we
are
through.
that’s
the
end
of
the
case.
instead
of
that,
it
looked
at
the
market
conditions,
here
they
have
99%;
the
travel
agents
have
80%.
what
is
your
justification
if
examined
each
of
the
justifications
offered
by
the
conferences
found
them
unsatisfactory
--
i
have
no
time
to
deal
with
them
here
and
then
concluded
that
therefore,
this
particular
arrangement,
this
particular
anticompetitive
arrangement,
is
much
harsher
than
is
necessary
to
serve
a
legitimate
shipping
act
functions.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
think
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
your
honor,
i
think
as
mr.
sisk
will
point
out
the
commission
did
make
the
findings
and
i’m
sure
he
will
explain
that
they
were
supported.
