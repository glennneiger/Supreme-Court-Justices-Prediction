justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don’t
say
any
antitrust
principles
are
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
--
do
you
say
that
the
commission,
as
a
starting
point
in
this
case
anyway,
in
starting
to
analyze
the
total
public
interest,
which
i
suppose
it
must
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
certainly
your
position,
doesn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
the
commission
may
not,
when
it
meets
face
to
face
with
an
agreement
like
this
say
on
the
exclusive
dealing
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
commission
may
not
on
its
face,
say
this
is
anticompetitive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
we
have
to
stop
there
for
a
minute.
do
you
think
it
has
to
have
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
is
anticompetitive?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
treat
this
is
a
per
se
rule
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
even
if
it
could,
i
would
suppose
it
must
go
on
and
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
anyway
about
yes,
it’s
anticompetitive
but
there
are
other
factors
which
outway
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
could
say
that
they
may
now
even
start
with
the
idea
that
it’s
anticompetitive
without
having
somebody
get
on
the
stand,
as
some
expert
to
say,
“well
the
normal
consequence
of
this
is
that
anticompetitive
consequences”
or
what
kind
of
evidence
would
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
why
that
just
seems
to
be
irrelevant
but
i
just
asked
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
what
you
just
said
would
say,
you
would
yes
that
every
agreement
has
got
some
anticompetitive
consequences.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
conference
agreement
is
not
a
competitive
by
its
very
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
need
any
evidence
to
prove
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
forget
about
what
is
an
antitrust
violation.
let’s
just
ask
whether
it’s
anticompetitive
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
not
sure
there’s
any
argument
about
that
with
anybody
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
thought
that
the
commission
isn’t
going
to
--
the
commission,
i
suppose
could
say
this
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement
but
there’s
plenty
of
reason
in
the
record
to
have
an
anticompetitive
arrangement
and
the
reasons
are
these
based
on
some
evidence
i
supposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
they
approved
the
agreement
in
the
exemption
on
the
antitrust
laws
is
achieved.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission
says
this
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement
and
nothing
that
the
other
side
or
that
the
conference
has
presented
justifies
that
the
public
interest
suffering
as
anticompetitive
impact,
i
would
suppose
that
under
the
same
act,
they
are
authorized
to
disapprove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
act
says
they
shall
disapprove
an
agreement,
unless
it’s
shown
that
the
public
interest
is
served
by
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
request
to
present
more
evidence
in
this
second
go
around
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
assumed
that
the
commission
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
this
agreement
was
contrary
to
public
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
commission
had
said
to
you,
“we
think
this
agreement
on
its
face
is
kind
of
agreement
that
normally
and
almost
imperatively
produces
anticompetitive
consequences
and
that
we’re
not
going
to
disapprove
it
if
you
can
explain
to
us
why
this
is
in
the
public
interest
or
why
it
does
not
have
burden
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states?
now,
we
are
perfectly
clear
to
put
on
evidence
in
this
respect
and
to
argue
evidence
and
try
to
convince
us
that
this
is
in
the
public
interest
in
spite
of
its
anticompetitive
impact”.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
weren’t
precluded
from
putting
on
in
the
evidence,
were
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
ask
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
there’s
only
one
thing
that
is
put
in
this
record
that
the
commission
says
that
here
is
a
agreement
which
amounts
to
boycott
and
these
kinds
of
agreements
are
normally
anticompetitive,
very
anticompetitive
and
they
ask
you,
“would
you
please
justify
this
because
we’d
like
to
approve
it.
it
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest”.
you
say,
“sorry,
you
were
coming
forward
with
nothing.
it’s
your
burden
to
show
that
it’s
contrary
to
public
interest”.
the
commission
says,
“we
think
it
is
contrary
on
its
face
because
it
normally
would
have
anticompetitive
consequences
and
unless
there’s
some
justification
for
suffering
these
anticompetitive
consequences,
we’re
going
to
disapprove
the
agreement”.
and,
you
remain
silent;
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
you
claim
lack
of
substantial
evidence,
which
is
precisely
what
you
are
claiming
here
and
you
say
you
must
win
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
lose
in
that
case,
would
you
lose
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
think
that
case
said
that
they
are
entitled
to
disregard
the
anticompetitive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
entitled
to
override
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
based
on
some
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
of
some
reasons
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
comes
down
to
--
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
this
agreement
where
the
only
evidence
there
is
in
the
case,
let’s
just
assume
the
case
that
is
an
agreement
which
normally
on
its
face
is
quite
anticompetitive
and
there
is
no
other
evidence,
no
other
reasons
given
as
to
why
the
public
interest
should
suffer
these
anticompetitive
consequences.
and
that
if
an
order
of
the
commission
is
like
that
just
based
on
the
contract,
isn’t
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
then
you’ve
got
a
strong
case.
but
there
must
be
some
other
reasons
given
or
some
evidence
to
override
the
contrary,
the
anticompetitive
act,
then
you
reached
the
question,
or
who
is
supposed
to
come
up
for
these
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commission
agreed
with
aster.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
exercised
their
judgment
and
said
that
there
are
no
reasons
which
really
justify
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don’t
say
any
antitrust
principles
are
