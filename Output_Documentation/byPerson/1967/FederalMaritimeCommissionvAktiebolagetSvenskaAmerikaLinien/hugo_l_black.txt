did
it
remand
the
case
to
the
commissions
or
the

there
--
justice

black
--
have
any
further
hearings
or
did
it
just
reverse
it
out
of
--
justice

l.
black
how
about
the
second
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
challenging
that
part
of
the
order
because
they
did
not
--
because
they
decided
for
themselves
instead
of
sending
it
back
to
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
hold
it’s
not.
are
you
agreeing
that
the
court
has
a
right
to
have
the
case
dismissed
without
having
any
further
hearings
or
any
decision
as
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i
want
to
find
out
is
if
the
government
has
agreed
that
the
court
has
a
right
to
end
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that’s
the
result
of
its
action,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
they
have
authority
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
had
authority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
challenging
the
findings
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you’re
challenging
the
court’s
findings
--
who
has
the
ultimate
right
to
make
those
findings,
the
commission
or
the
reviewing
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
commission
find
on
that
disputed
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
commission
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
saying
that
they
failed
to
establish;
it
was
their
burden
to
establish?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
40
years
of
age
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
did
it?
they
had
the
right
to
change
it
to
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
back
to
the
question,
you
would
say
they
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
didn’t
mean
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assert
you
to
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
your
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what?
what
was
your
burden
of
proof
put
on
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
claim
is
you
did
that,
did
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
claim
that
you
have
met
the
burden
of
proof
so
that
it
was
attributed
to
the
trial
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
you
would
have
thought,
you
had
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
claim
that
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
found
you
did
not,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn’t
that
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn’t
that
the
main
issue.
you
used
it
yourself
a
moment
ago
that
you
are
justifying
your
position
and
they
found
you
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
is
your
burden
to
prove
the
other
thing,
couldn’t
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
don’t
believe
it’s
your
burden
to
justify
that
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
your
burden
to
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whose
burden
do
you
think
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
suppose
there
were
no
exemptions
here
from
the
antitrust
law,
in
your
judgment,
would
this
agreement
violate
the
antitrust
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
--
i
want
to
ask
you
that
question
because
i
have
understood
by
your
argument
that
--
what
has
to
be
proved?
why
is
it
not
over
for
the
commission
on
an
agreement
which
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
but
for
the
exemptions
to
say
we
will
await,
prove
by
the
shipping
lines
that
authorizes
taking
this
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wouldn’t
have
decided
to
put
on
efforts
itself
--
that’s
what
bothers
me
and
it
seems
to
me
like
you
stand
up
with
(voice
overlap).
