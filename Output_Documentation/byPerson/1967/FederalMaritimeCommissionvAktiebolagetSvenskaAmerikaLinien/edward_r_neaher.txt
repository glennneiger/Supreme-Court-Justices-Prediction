mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
put
a
question
to
mr.
seibel,
asking
whether
a
majority
of
the
lines
supported
the
government’s
position
in
this
case.
i
think
mr.
seibel
interpreted
that
question
to
mean.
was
there
a
majority
of
lines
way
back
10
or
15
years
ago
in
favor
of
an
increase
in
commissions?
i
think
he
answered
the
question
“yes”
in
that
light
but
i’m
not
sure
that
there
may
not
be
some
confusion
here
as
to
where
the
conference
lines
stand
on
the
matters
before
the
court.
i
am
the
spokesman
here
for
all
the
lines
who
unanimously
agreed
that
the
commission
was
wrong
and
the
court
below
was
right.
in
other
words,
we
believe,
our
clients
believe,
that
the
two
rules
which
have
been
struck
down
by
the
commission
here
after
some
40
years
of
approval
strike
at
the
foundation
of
the
conferences
themselves.
we
agree
that
over
40
years
these
conferences
developed
barnacles
in
connection
with
the
supervision
and
control
of
agents
and
that
there
were
great
many
improvements
which
the
commission
ordered,
as
a
result
of
this
investigation,
many
of
which
the
conference
itself
had
recognized
and
it
began
to
do
something
about
it.
and
the
commission
agrees
here
that
all
of
this
was
done
and
that
only
matters
litigated
below,
which
were
the
focus
of
this
entire
inquiry
was
whether
this
unanimity
rule
and
this
conference
tying
rule
were
good
or
bad.
the
commission
condemned
them
as
bad
and
we
say
it
condemned
them
essentially
on
antitrust
principles,
not
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence.
and
we
say
that
on
the
first
opinion
below,
the
court
pointed
that
out.
as
mr.
justice
fortas
had
said,
he
told
the
agency,
you
have
applied
the
incorrect
standard
of
review.
and
when
it
came
back
to
the
court
the
second
time,
it
came
back
upon
the
same
record
and
we
believe
the
court
below
reversed
the
second
time,
to
answer
mr.
justice
black’s
question,
because
the
court
treated
the
commissions
re-written
report
on
remand
as
the
tacit
admission
that
on
this
record,
the
commission
could
come
up
with
nothing
better
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
did
i
think
the
court
had
authority
to
do
that?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
believe
it
did
and
i
believe
this
court
very
recently
in
a
case
exercised
that
authority
itself.
i
think
it
was
the
consolo
case
where
they
pointed
out
that
the
case
has
been
around
for
eight
years
and
while
we
could
send
that
back
to
the
commission
to
do
something,
we
think
we
are
just
as
competent
to
tell
from
the
record
here
what
was
right
and
dispose
off
it
finally.
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
will
remember
that
case
since
he
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
am
i?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
must
answer
that
the
commission
alone
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
making
the
factual
findings.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
i
believe
the
court
below
reversed
because
it
interpreted
the
commission’s
action
in
coming
back
simply
with
a
revised
argument
as
to
why
antitrust
principles
were
sufficient
here
to
condemn
these
rules
as
an
admission
that
the
only
question
that
had
to
be
decided
really
was
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
was
sufficient.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
certainly
do
not,
mr.
justice
white.
i
couldn’t
possibly
take
that
position.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
certainly
is,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
may
say
it
is
but
i
think
something
more
is
required.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
my
position
that
it
may
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
our
position
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
say
there
would
have
to
be
evidence
of
the
working
of
the
rule
in
practice,
in
accordance
with
the
evil
label
attached
to
it.
that
is
to
say
--
well,
let
me
try
to
explain
it
this
way.
aren’t
we
all
agreed
here
that
every
conference
agreement
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement,
is
it
not?
it’s
concert
of
action
on
matters
of
competition
which
are
under
our
domestic
antitrust
policy
would
be
unlawful
were
it
not
for
the
exception
granted
by
the
shipping
act.
i’m
sorry
if
i’m
not
--
i’m
trying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
then
i
must
have
misunderstood.
i
do
agree,
no.
1,
that
the
commission
should
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
every
agreement
is
a
matter
of
competitive
consequence,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
it
is.
and
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
we’re
talking
about
an
agreement
that’s
presented
to
the
commission
for
the
first
time
and
the
commission
has
asked
to
approve
the
xyz
conference
and
on
the
face
of
the
agreement
is
written,
we
agree
that
we
won’t
do
a
number
of
competitive
things
and
the
commission
can
see
right
from
the
face
of
that
agreement
that
of
course,
it
would
be
antitrust
violation
for
these
lines
to
agree
to
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
anticompetitive
–
that
it
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement.
now,
what
does
the
shipping
act
contemplate?
that
the
commission
should
say
that’s
an
anticompetitive
agreement;
it
is
bad
therefore,
we
will
disapprove
it.
now,
if
that
is
so,
why
do
we
have
a
shipping
act
with
an
antitrust
exemption
in
it?
isn’t
the
purpose
to
weigh
what
advantages
or
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
that
agreement
and
decide
that
even
though
it
is
anticompetitive,
we
will
approve
it.
and
this
is
what
i
think
the
commission
is
thus
practically
everyday.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
now
i
think
–
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
have
a
slight
disagreement
with
you
on
that,
your
honor,
because
a
public
interest
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
believe
it
is
in
this
respect
that
the
public
interest,
as
now
inserted
in
section
15
of
the
shipping
act,
and
that
standard
was
inserted
when
congress
passed
the
dual
rate
law
in
1961.
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
as
it
appears
in
the
shipping
act,
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
i
think
this
court
in
numerous
cases
has
pointed
out
that
the
public
interest
in
the
regulatory
statute,
takes
it’s
meaning
from
the
context
of
the
statue.
it
isn’t
an
amorphous
concept
meaning,
that
because
the
effect
of
the
rule,
as
they
say,
is
to
restrain
travel
agents
in
some
way
that
that
is
bad
per
se
and
must
inevitably
be
condemned.
what
i’m
trying
to
point
out
and
i
hope
i
am
answering
your
honors’
question
is,
that
here
was
a
rule
approved
for
40
years.
one
would
have
thought
that
in
40
years
of
operation,
it
would
have
been
a
relatively
simple
matter
to
produce
evidence
that
this
rule
had
the
“harsh
restraints”
–
to
use
counsel’s
expression
here
this
morning
-–
that
they
charge
it
with
heavy
and
that
it
had
no
redeeming
feature
whatsoever.
and
we
are
saying,
as
the
two
dissenting
commissioner’s
pointed
out,
this
whole
question
of
the
competitive
necessity
or
the
competitive
advantage
versus
disadvantage
of
this
rule
was
not
explored
in
this
proceeding.
this
was
not,
as
they
say,
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
were
not
acquainted
with
every
jar
and
kettle
of
what
the
commission
said
it
was
going
to
do
to
us
when
it
ended
up
with
this
decision.
we
did
the
best
we
could
to
put
in
evidence,
to
counter
matters
and
issues
as
they
came
up
during
the
course
of
it
but
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
we
did
not.
we
assumed
when
the
commission
read
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
had
that
--
no,
your
honor,
i
can’t
say
that.
we
assumed
that
the
commission
had
the
duty
to
do
whatever
the
court
directed
it
to
do
and
to
reopen
the
proceeding
in
any
manner
that
was
appropriate
to
accomplish
that?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
the
commission
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
did
not.
the
commission
simply
said,
“we’ll
hold
an
oral
argument
and
we
want
each
party
to
point
out
first
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
the
form
of
the
proceeding
was
simply
we
would
comment.
it’s
in
the
record.
we
were
directed
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
we
did
not
ask,
your
honor.
we
were
directed
to
file
briefs
and
to
appear
for
oral
argument
and
to
specify
in
those
briefs,
by
reference,
the
specific
facts
relied
on
and
that’s
what
was
done.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
when
you
say
did
we
have
the
opportunity,
we
certainly
tried
through
conference
witnesses
and
through
such
documents
as
winan
to
justify,
if
you
can
put
up
that
way,
our
position
which
was
that
on
all
the
matters
in
issue
and
most
of
the
matters
related
to
the
matters
which
are
not
in
issue
here,
very
little
attention
was
paid
to
this
tying
rule.
most
of
the
attention
was
paid
to
the
unanimity
rule
in
the
proceeding
below
because
aster
was
the
vigorous
proponent
having
started
this
whole
thing
on
with
an
ultimatum
to
the
conference.
we
can
no
longer
abide
the
unanimity
rule
and
they
were
out
to
prove
that
that
unanimity
rule
prevented
the
travel
agents
from
getting
increased
commissions.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
examiner
found
that
those
arguments
or
the
evidence
offered
in
support
of
their
arguments
that
had
blocked
the
commission,
consideration
and
the
result
that
in
the
travel
agents
not
pushing
any
translation
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
the
commission
disagreed
with
that.
the
commission
disagreed
with
the
examiner.
but
we
say
what
the
commission
failed
to
establish
was,
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
there
would
have
been
an
increase
in
commissions,
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
that
increase
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
was
their
burden
to
establish
and
i
think,
yes
that
when
they
attacked
the
rule,
which
has
already
been
approved
that
it
is
their
burden
to
show
by
evidence
that
it
is
doing
what
they
say
it
is
doing.
and
that
is
why,
to
get
back
to
this
per
se
application
of
antitrust
principles,
i’m
saying
that
after
40
years
of
operation
under
a
rule,
if
it
was
as
bad
as
they
say
it
was,
that
they
ought
would
have
been
able
to
prove
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
don’t
question
they
had
the
right
to
change
it
but
i
say
that
surely,
it
shouldn’t
be
changed
on
an
arbitrary
basis.
i
say
the
application
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’d
say
that
--
here’s
what
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
alright,
i’m
trying
to
say
this,
they
had
the
burden
of
reaching
a
decision
upon
a
substantial
evidence.
that’s
all
i
am
saying
here.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
produce
whatever
evidence
we
had?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
burden
of
proof
put
on
us
to
show
--
you
might
say
to
show
that
the
rule
wasn’t
bad
despite
it’s
per
se
lingual
to
show
that
the
rule
wasn’t
bad.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
claim
we
did
whatever
we
could
to
demonstrate
it.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
say
we
did
what
we
were
required
to
do-
-
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
but
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
they
did
not
find
that,
your
honor.
they
said
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
said
we
showed
no
justification.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
wouldn’t
the
issue
be
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
think
that
perhaps
i’m
getting
put
into
a
position
here
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
this
and
it
simply
this,
that
the
commission
must
base
its
order
on
substantial
evidence
and
cannot
base
its
order
on
antitrust
principles
alone.
that’s
my
key
position.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
we
don’t
believe
it
is
our
burden
to
establish
the
substantial
evidence
by
which
the
commission
had
to
condemn
and/or
prove
the
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right.
we
don’t
believe
it’s
our
burden
to
justify.
we
believe
that
the
justification
occurred
when
the
shipping
act
itself
was
enacted;
that
congress
found
the
justification
for
conferences
and
their
agreements
by
enacting
the
act
and
the
act
set
up
the
standards
the
commission
was
to
apply
in
judging
whether
an
agreement
was
entitled
to
or
not
entitled
to
antitrust
exemption
under
the
act.
that’s
our
position
in
essence.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
burden.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
it
was
the
commission’s
burden
to
see
to
it
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
its
order
and
that
if
it’s
order
is
not
substantially
supported,
it
must
be
set
aside.
it
isn’t
a
question
of
burden
of
proof.
they
say
this
isn’t
a
trial.
we
don’t
have
a
burden
proof
unless
we
are
defending
as
we
would
do
in
the
trial.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
so
based
on
the
legislative
history.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
we
lost
in
that
case,
we
would
be
lose
here.
well,
i
am
afraid
--
i
don’t
know
what
would
happen
here,
your
honor,
and
like
crystal
ball
is
not
that
clear.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry.
i
want
to
say
that
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
shipping
is
examined
originally
as
adopted
by
congress
in
1916
and
as
it’s
intentions
and
purposes
were
affirmed
when
the
dual
rate
law
amended
that
act
in
1961,
it
is
very
clear
that
when
congress
itself
devised
the
standards
by
which
competitive
agreements
are
to
be
judged,
this
court,
in
the
carnation
case,
itself
pointed
out
that
the
language
of
that
provision,
referring
to
section
16,
must
have
been
selected
as
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
in
order
to
indicate
the
extent
to
which
the
industry’s
rate-making
activities
remain
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
as
well
as
to
the
extent
to
which
those
activities
are
exempted
from
antitrust
regulation.
and,
i’m
saying,
for
the
commission
to
come
in
and
say
“you
have
an
anticompetitive
agreement
here”
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry;
it’s
the
beginning
of
it.
it
is
the
beginning
of
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
that
anticompetitive
agreement
on
its
face
is
as
bad
as
it
might
be
deemed
to
be
if
we
were
applying
domestic
antitrust
concepts
to
this
area
of
international
commerce.
this
area
of
international
commerce,
as
congress
has
clearly
pointed
out,
is
not
one
in
which
our
domestic
antitrust
concepts,
traditional
concepts
can
be
fully
applied.
the
atlantic
ocean
is
an
area
of
free
trade
for
all
nations
of
the
world.
it
is
true
that
when
the
shipping
conferences
or
vessels
–
which
represent
those
nations,
there’s
some
15
nations
represented
in
this
conference.
when
they
get
together
and
form
a
conference
and
ask
for
exemption
from
our
antitrust
laws,
we
don’t
say
that
they
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
some
antitrust
regulation
but
we
say
that
congress
carefully
marked
out
what
the
limits
of
the
antitrust
application
was
to
be
and
the
antitrust
application
was
phrased
in
terms
of,
do
you,
the
commission,
find
this
agreement
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
if
you
do
disapprove
it
but
if
you
don’t,
it
is
not
left
to
your
discretion?
“whether
to
approve
or
disapprove,
you
shall
approve
all
other
agreements”,
says
congress.
secondly,
do
you
find
this
agreement
contrary
to
the
public
interest?
if
you
do,
disapprove
it
but
if
you
don’t
find
it
so,
you
must
approve
it.
the
same
goes,
whether
it’s
discriminatory,
unjustly
discriminatory
as
between
carriers
or
whether
it
violates
some
other
provisions
of
the
act
such
as
section
14.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
should
think
that
would
be
--
are
you
saying
the
terms
of
the
agreement
or
that
the
agreement
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
that
if
the
agreement
stopped
with
that,
that
they
would
only
carry
the
steel
of
united
states
steel,
that
would
run
squarely
a
foul
of
that
section
which
says
you
can’t
approve
an
agreement
which
is
unjustly
discriminatory
to
import
as
or
export
as
in
that
sort
of
thing.
you
have
to
worry
about
public
interest
thing.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
again
is
this;
i
think
that
congress
has
said,
“if
the
commission
finds
that
an
agreement
operates
contrary
to
one
or
more
of
the
statutory
standards,
then
it
shall
disapprove
the
agreement.
i
don’t
think
the
question
is
really
one
a
burden
of
proof.
i
think
it
is
one
of
whether
when
the
commission
makes
the
finding,
the
finding
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
if
that
is
so.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
i
have
to
respectfully
differ
with
that
because
i
believe
that
what
your
honor
is
saying
here
is
that
ordinary
rules
of
burden
of
proof
as
applicable
in
a
court
of
law
and
adversary
proceedings
shall
apply
to
the
commission’s
determinations
when
it
is
exercising
the
responsibility
placed
on
it
by
the
shipping
act.
and
i’m
saying
that
when
the
act
was
amended
to
insert
the
contrary
to
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
15,
the
commission
itself
told
the
congress
that
it
did
not
want
that
standard
expressed
in
a
way
which
required
the
commission
to
affirmatively
find
that
an
agreement
was
in
the
public
interest
before
it
could
approve
it.
now,
that
was
the
way
the
house
had
originally
passed
its
bill
to
amend
section
15
and
we
cite
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
the
commission
said
there
are
many
times
when
conferences
come
forward
with
agreements
which
we
couldn’t
find
to
serve
any
public
interest
purpose
but
we
don’t
want
to
be
--
but
these
agreements
do
not
violate
one
of
the
standards
of
the
act.
we
don’t
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
affirmatively
find
that
these
agreements
are
in
the
public
interest.
we
wanted
phrased
in
the
conventional
terms
that
these
agreements
shall
be
approved
unless
we
find
them
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
the
senate,
the
house
itself
then
amended
its
original
bill
to
incorporate
the
language
in
that
form.
the
senate
made
a
slight
change
so
that
it
appears
as
it
now
does
you
must
--
you
shall
disapprove
agreements
which
would
operate
to
the
depth
of
commerce
and
which
are
contrary
to
public
interest
operate
unjustly
or
discriminate
unjustly,
etcetera.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think,
i’ll
have
to
say
i
know
of
no
other
but
i
know
of
no
other
industry
that
doesn’t
also
happen
to
be
fully
within
the
control
of
a
united
states
regulatory
agency.
that
is
to
say
the
shipping
act
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
the
atlantic
ocean
is
not
our
lake;
that
it
happens
to
be
an
ocean,
which
is
as
much
--
has
as
much
commercial
interest
for
other
nations
of
the
world
as
it
has
for
the
united
states.
that
is
to
say
our
foreign
commerce
can
also
be
the
foreign
commerce
of
another
nation.
and,
congress,
in
enacting
the
act,
recognized
that
the
only
in
which
destructive
competition
which
experience
had
taught
was
the
kind
of
competition
that
resulted
when
there
wasn’t
a
voluntary
self-regulation;
that
that
kind
of
competition
was
bad
for
the
public
interest;
that
it
resulted
in
cut
throat
practices,
under
handed
agreements,
deprive
the
public
of
regularity
and
dependability
of
service
and
stability
of
rates
and
congress
said
the
only
way
we
cannot
accomplish
this
is
to
get
these
carriers
to
agree
to
enter
conferences,
which
will
be
subjected
to
the
supervision
of
a
regulatory
agency
that
we
set
up
under
reasonable
standards
of
regulation.
and,
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
that
when
an
antitrust
concept
per
se
illegality
is
applied
to
a
conference
agreement
or
rule
as
the
case
may
be,
we
are
applying
our
traditional
antitrust
concepts
in
their
full
vigor
contrary
to
what
congress
said
should
be
done
in
this
particularly
industry.
now,
therefore,
i
say
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
am
well
aware
of
that
ordinary
rule.
to
me,
that
is
an
ordinary
antitrust
rule
domestically
namely;
that
he
who
seeks
the
benefit
of
an
exemption
from
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
it’s
a
domestic
operation,
your
honor.
it
is
not
an
international
shipping
operation.
the
railroads
are
fully
subject
to
the
control
of
our
regulatory
agents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
icc
has
much
broader
powers.
in
fact,
the
icc
is
entitled
to
disregard
the
anticompetitive
effects
at
it
did
in
the
recent
case,
i
think
the
denvery
o’grand
case
where
a
merger
was
approved
which
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
served
the
public
interest
from
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
denvery
o’grand
case.
i
believe
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
didn’t
mean
it
in
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
override
them
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
based
on
some
evidence.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
and
i
am
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
and
i
am
saying
that
what
the
commission
refers
to
here
as
a
per
se
group
boycott
could
be
overwritten
by
--
that
is
to
say
there
could
be
evidence
and
there
could
be
reason
and
we
say
there
was
neither
reason
or
evidence
here
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
per
se
illegal
and
that
as
the
dissenting
commissioners
pointed
out,
that
subject
was
not
even
explored.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
may
i
--
right.
and,
your
honor
has
stated
exactly
our
position
that
the
question
here
is
basically
--
was
the
court
below
correct
in
its
view
of
this,
in
its
appraisal
of
this
record
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
what
was
done.
but
i
would
like
to
add,
so
long
as
we
are
talking
about
reasons,
why
this
tying
ruleserves
a
reasonable
purpose.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
two-fold
standpoint,
the
tying
ruleis
a
rule
where
by
certain
selected
agents,
travel
agents,
traditionally
serving
the
steamship
trade,
have
been
appointed
by
the
lines
as
their
agents
sort
of
exclusive
dealing
arrangement.
they
are
not
just
any
agent.
they
were
carefully
selected
agents.
and
in
the
early
days
of
shipping
here,
many
of
these
selections
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
since
so
many
nations
of
the
world
come
here,
they
are
selected
on
a
nationality
basis,
for
example.
and
why
are
they
selected?
because
of
their
nationality
and
other
ties;
they
control
traffic.
they
control
the
passengers.
just
as
in
the
dual
rate
system,
the
conference
gives
a
lower
rate
to
get
the
exclusive
patronage
of
the
shippers
who
are
going
to
commit
the
transportation
of
their
goods
to
the
conference
carriers
for
the
benefit
they
received.
these
agents
do
receive
benefits
as
to
say
it’s
not
enough.
we
think
otherwise.
but
the
point
is,
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
commission
didn’t
agree
with
aster
to
this
extent.
aster
had
said
to
the
commission,
the
7%
commission
rate
that
these
lines
are
paying
us
is
an
unlawful,
non-compensatory
rate.
the
commission
said
on
this
record,
we
cannot
make
that
finding.
we
cannot
find
it’s
unreasonably
low.
we
cannot
find
agents
are
losing
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
evidence
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
shows
they
are
holding
their
own
even
vis-à-vis
airlines;
that
more
and
more
agents
are
applying
for
conference
appointment
obviously
not
terribly
concerned
about
group
boycotts.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
findings
were
made
with
respect
to
the
tying
ruleby
the
examiner
uncontested.
no
agent
ever
lost
his
appointment
because
of
the
tying
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i’m
saying
--
i
was
about
to
give
you
some
reasons.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
and
here’s
what
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
don’t
want
you
to
disagree
with
the
commission
at
all.
i
very
much
like
you
to
agree
with
the
court
below
and
i
suppose
you
have
to
undertake
now
a
de
novo
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right,
on
the
basis
of
no
substantial
evidence.
but
what
i
was
about
to
say
was,
that
the
commission
brushed
aside
the
tying
rule
by
saying
to
us,
“you
don’t
have
one
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
we
don’t
have
a
conference
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade
and
the
reason
we
don’t
have
a
conference
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade
is
that
it
differs
essentially
in
character
from
the
trans-atlantic
passenger
trade.
it
wasn’t
investigated
but
it’s
common
knowledge
that
steamships
come
and
go
in
the
cruise
trade.
they
commit
themselves
to
no
regularity
and
frequency
of
service.
they
frequently
cancel
sailings.
they
go
where
they
make
money.
the
conference
is
necessary
because
in
it,
a
group
of
carriers
agree
that
all
year
long,
good
season,
bad
season,
they
will
maintain
a
regular
service
across
the
atlantic.
that
means
that
while
they
can
fill
their
ships
in
the
summer
months
when
it’s
pleasant
to
travel,
eight
or
nine
months
of
the
year,
they
must
go
over
with
more
crew
than
they
have
passengers.
so,
it
is
essential
to
them
to
try
to
assure,
just
as
the
cargo
vessels
must
assure,
the
loyalty
of
the
merchants,
if
you
can
call
them
at
upon
--
on
their
patronage
depends.
so
the
tying
rule
and
it’s
set
forth
that
it’s
not
absolute.
it
says
you
can’t
do
it
without
permission
but
they
say
the
record
shows
it’s
enforced.
the
tying
rule
ties
these
selected
travel
agents
to
the
patronage
of
these
lines
all
year
long
so
the
lines
can
try
to
fill
their
ships
with
these
many
passengers
in
four
season
as
they
can
to
be
able
to
maintain
the
financial
stability
they
need
in
order
to
provide
the
regularity
of
service,
and
frequency
of
service,
and
dependability
which
is
in
the
public
interest.
that’s
point
one.
the
other
point
is
this;
if
you
say
a
travel
agent
is
no
longer
tied
to
the
conference,
what
happens
to
the
conference?
why
should
a
line
remain
in
a
conference
if
it
can
get
these
agents
without
having
to
belong
to
the
conference?
and
therefore,
we
get
down
into
some
fundamental
philosophy.
we
say
that
congress
recognized
that
conferences
were
justifiable,
that
they
were
desirable
though
they
had
abuses
and
needed
regulation
and
that
the
only
way
they
could
effectively
exist
was
to
give
them
reasons
why
they
should
be.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
saying
they
would.
i’m
saying
a
strong
inducement
for
keeping
the
lines
in
the
conference
would
be
lost.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
maintain
it
is.
we
maintain
it
is
a
fundamental
rule
of
a
passenger
conference.
your
honor
will
remember
that
the
dual
rate
decision
of
this
court,
1958,
created
a
tremendous
furor
in
the
shipping
industry
because
it
was
pointed
out
that
most
of
the
trade
conferences
depend
upon
the
dual
rate
contract
system
as
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
based
on
their
trade
that’s
why
they
aren’t.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
it’s
a
violation
of
law
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
it’s
a
violation
of
the
shipping
act
--
that’s
what
we’re
saying.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
and
even
if
it
shown
to
be
such
by
substantial
evidence,
our
goose
is
cooked.
that’s
really
what
we
say.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
agency
found
that
these
two
rules
should
be
condemned
as
violative
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
that
conference
--
i’m
not
prepared
to
represent
that
to
the
court.
i’m
simply
saying
that
in
a
passenger
conference
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
conference
also
regulates
rates.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
only
telling,
your
honor,
that
the
alexander
report,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
the
control
of
agency
forces
was
a
principal
object
of
a
passenger
conference.
remember,
a
freight
conference’s
principal
reason
for
being
is
the
control
of
freight
rates.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
uniformity
of
passenger
fares
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
it
is
in
a
way
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
is
in
a
way.
i
have
to
agree
to
that.
and,
i’m
not
saying
that
there
wouldn’t
be
other
reasons
but
i’m
saying
this;
that
a
strong
inducement
for
remaining
in
the
conference
is
the
existence
of
the
tying
rule
and
also
of
this
unanimity
rule.
and
i
didn’t
have
time
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
are
reasons
also
why
the
unanimity
rule
should
not
have
been
condemned
out
of
hand
in
this
way
and
that
is
this.
congress,
in
the
1961
legislative
debate
over
the
dual
rate
law,
pointed
out
that
in
most
conferences
the
american
flag
lines
represent
a
small
minority.
in
these
conferences,
there
are
two
american
lines
in
one,
three
in
the
other.
now
if
you
say
or
as
the
commission
does,
that
such
matters
is
the
rate
of
commission
which
is
after
all
a
financial
matter
that
enters
into
the
general
financial
picture
of
each
line
may
be
fixed
by
a
dominant
group
majority.
you
are
up
to
leave
the
small
minority
american
flag
lines
right
out
in
the
cold
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
unanimity
rule
on
a
matter
of
this
sort
is
to
see
to
it
that
each
line
has
an
effective
participation
in
determining
the
area
of
competition
on
which
it
is
willing
to
agree.
it
means,
in
other
words,
that
if
you
say
that
rate
of
commission
may
be
fixed
by
a
so-called
“majority”
that
smaller
lines
with
less
resources
could
be
driven
out
of
the
trade
because
they
could
not
meet
the
higher
rate
of
commission
that
a
more
financially
affluent
line
could
afford
to
pay.
and
the
whole
idea
of
the
conference,
repugnant
as
it
may
sound
to
some,
is
to
try
to
stabilize
that
rate
of
commission
which
all
are
willing
to
live
with.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
my
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
no.
1,
factually,
based
on
the
record,
it
is
inaccurate
to
this
extent.
the
record
shows
there
were
but
four
lines
in
this
conference
which
call
that
canadian
ports,
rather
than
united
states
ports
on
their
travels
from
europe,
tour
from
europe.
on
the
four
lines,
one
of
them
is
a
major
competitor
of
the
american
lines
--
that
is
canadian
pacific
station,
which
sells
substantial
thousands
of
bookings
here
in
the
u.s.
because
--
while
it
is
in
the
record,
it’s
a
common
knowledge
--
a
person
living
in
the
middle
west
of
the
united
states
can
fly
as
easily
to
montreal
and
get
a
ship
to
europe
as
he
can
to
new
york.
and,
historically,
and
this
is
something
the
examiners
seem
to
have
overlooked,
although
it
is
well
documented
in
the
alexander
report,
there
has
never
been
a
separate
trade
between
canada
and
europe
and
between
the
united
states
and
europe
because
first
of
all
the
ports
of
canada,
the
seaports
of
canada
which
are
used
for
passenger
trade
are
geographically
contiguous
to
those
of
the
atlantic,
north
atlantic
ports
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
there
are
three
lines,
there
were
three
lines
at
that
time
that
had
--
that
did
not
call
at
u.s.
ports
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
or
they
call
it
canadian
ports.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh,
i’m
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
all
lines
call
a
canadian
port
or
that
another
line,
all
conference
members
call
either
at
canadian
ports
or
united
states
ports.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
regularly,
that’s
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
times
when
canadian
lines
do
the
weather
in
canada
must
use
u.s.
ports.
that’s
right.
and
now
that
the
seaway
was
open,
you
have
many
lines
going
through
into
the
great
lakes;
some
of
these
canadian
lines
now
do
that.
the
point
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
conference
agreement,
the
only
trade,
the
atlantic
passenger
trade
viewed
north
america
as
the
terminus
on
the
western
end
and
that
included
the
canada
and
the
u.s.
the
american
society
of
travel
agent
itself
reflects
that
because
it
includes
the
agents
of
both
countries
in
its
organization.
it
elects
even
once
in
a
while
a
canadian
as
president
of
its
organization
and
has
directives
from
there.
but
the
point
is,
that
there
is
no
separate
trade.
the
conference
covers
the
trade
as
a
historical
unity
growing
out
of
geographical
and
economic
factors.
so
there
is
no
rational
basis,
really
for
excluding
even
this
minimum
number
as
having
no
interest
in
the
trade
as
distinguished
from
interest
in
what
might
be
termed
“exclusively
u.s.
foreign
commerce”.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
ultimate
sanction,
i
would
say,
is
the
adoption
of
regulations
that
the
foreign
lines
are
voluntarily
willing
to
accept.
now,
that
may
seem
extreme
but
i
mean
reasonable
regulations
that
they
are
prepared
and
when
i
say
“they”,
with
the
acquiescence
of
their
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
dual
rate
law
was
proposed,
the
congress,
the
house
had
put
some
provisions
in
that
bill
which
our
department
of
state
said
represented
an
intrusion,
an
attempt
to
intrude
the
jurisdiction
of
our
government
into
matters
which
will
beyond
his
jurisdiction,
namely
saying
to
anyone
before
you
may
belong
to
a
conference
and
obtain
the
benefit
of
our
antitrust
law,
you
must
agree
in
advance
to
subject
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
our
courts.
now
many
foreign
governments
found
this
extremely
repugnant
because
they
didn’t
believe,
as
i
say,
that
the
only
commerce
on
the
atlantic
ocean
was
that
of
the
united
states.
maritime
nations
of
long
standing
like
great
britain
and
the
germany
and
other
countries
were
very
much
opposed
to
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
all
i’m
saying
here
is
that
congress
has
made
clear
that
our
traditional
antitrust
concepts
cannot
be
fully
applied
to
this
area
of
commerce.
i
am
saying,
in
other
words,
that
decisions
in
this
area
must
be
tempered
by
a
recognition
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
domestic
antitrust
scene.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
this
agreement
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i’m
not
at
all
to
get
assured
that
the
board
of
trade
of
london
would
agree
that
this
industry
is
governed
by
constitution
the
united
states
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
what
congress
was
pointing
out.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
alright,
i’m
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
disagreeing
with
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
i’m
not
trying
to
do
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
cartel
as
i
know
of
that
often
evokes
impressions
of
something
evil
and
to
be
--
shall
we
say
driven
out
of
existence.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
not
to
make
any
exception
in
the
even
handed
administration
of
the
shipping
act
because
simply
because
some
of
the
travel
agents
that
served
the
conference
happen
to
be
located
in
the
united
states.
i
certainly
do
agree
that
if
the
commission
were
to
find
by
substantial
evidence
that
travel
agents
here
were
suffering
something
that
they
shouldn’t
be
obliged
to
suffer
because
of
what
this
conference
agreement
was
doing
to
them
or
permitting
to
be
done
to
them.
i
certainly
agree
100%
with
the
idea
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
strike
it
down
and
should
strike
it
down.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
in
this
record,
you
will
find
that
i
believe
as
the
court,
as
far
judges
as
you
pointed
out
yourself
below
did
not
find
it.
it
was
raised
on
the
basis
that
it
was
per
se
illegal
despite,
as
i
say,
40
years
of
operation
in
which
one
would
have
thought
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
really
regret
that
there
seems
to
be
this
misunderstanding
because
certainly
it
is
not
my
intention
to
advance
theories
or
positions
here
which
in
anyway
militate
against
the
power
of
an
agency
of
this
government
to
do
what
it
is
called
upon
to
do
to
protect
our
citizens,
our
commercial
interest.
that’s
not
what
i’m
saying.
i’m
simply
saying
that
i
believe
the
spirit
or
the
purpose
or
the
limits
that
have
been
imposed
upon
this
industry
were
imposed
by
congress
in
the
shipping
act
and
that
the
legislative
history
is
fairly
clear
that
congress
recognized
that
there
was
a
unique
area
of
international
trade
involved
here
in
which
a
certain
accommodation
had
to
be
made,
as
this
court
itself
referred
to
it
in
the
carnation
case
--
that
it
was
an
accommodation
of
conflicting
interest
between
foreign
maritime
nations
and
our
desire,
the
demands
of
our
domestic
antitrust
policy,
which
of
course
favors
free
competition
which
strikes
down
anything
that
imposes
unnecessary,
unreasonable
restraints
on
people.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
have
to
say
it
would.
i
mean,
if
we’re
talking
about
the
idea
that
what
is
it?
it’s
a
concert
of
action
by
competitors
in
effect
to
fix
the
price,
if
you
call
it,
that
the
price
they
will
pay
for
a
service.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
because
i
think
that
applying
that
notion
of
requiring
someone
who
claims
an
exemption
from
antitrust
laws
to
come
forward
and
show
he
is
entitled
to
it,
is
not
the
way
congress
has
said
the
shipping
act
shall
be
administered.
the
shipping
act
doesn’t
say
the
commission
may
approve
an
agreement.
it
says
it
must
approve
it
unless
it
finds
one,
two,
three,
four.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
that
substantial
evidence
must
be
the
basis
for
its
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
is
perfectly
clear,
i
believe
that
the
antitrust
evasion
is
seeking
to
reargue
here
a
battle
it
lost
before
congress
in
1961
when
it
was
trying
to
convince
congress
that
antitrust
provision
should
be
incorporated
in
the
amendments
to
the
shipping
act
which
were
then
adopted.
now,
why
weren’t
they.
senator
claire
angel,
who
was
the
manager
of
this
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
house
of
the
senate.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
i’m
quoting
now
from
the
senate
document
no.100,
which
is
the
index
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
steamship
conference
dual
rate
law.
it’s
a
convenient
abiding
which
contains
everything
including
the
reports
referred
to
in
our
brief.
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
this;
congress
was
concerned
with
two
things.
no.
1,
if
it
was
going
to
authorize
or
confirm
that
steamship
conferences
and
the
activities
there
under
were
to
be
lawful.
those
conferences
must
be
able
to
be
affected.
they
must
have
as
it
was
put
effective
tying
arrangements.
secondly,
if
they
were
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
there
must
be
protection
for
the
american
flag
minority
which
congress
pointed
out
with
a
high
cost
operators
who
couldn’t
compete
on
a
dollar
for
dollar
basis
with
lower
courts
europeans.
and
senator
angel
said,
the
reason
that
these
antitrust
amendments
or
proposals
advanced
by
the
department
of
justice
were
not
adopted.
he
put
it
in
rather
colorful
language.
he
said,
“we
found
it
wholly
impossible”
-
this
is
page
462
of
the
book
i
just
mentioned
–
“to
authorize
what
amounted
to
a
quasi
monopoly
or
a
semi-monopoly
and
then
turn
around
and
de-authorize
it.
there
was
simply
no
way
to
go.
in
other
words,
to
march
up
the
hill
and
say
they
were
lawful,
and
then
march
down
again
and
adopt
things
that
would
make
them
unlawful.
and
as
i
say,
the
tying
rule
of
this
passenger
conference
is
precisely
the
effective
kind
of
tying
arrangement
that
is
of
importance
in
keeping
this
conference
together
as
a
conference
and
eliminating
competition
for
travel
agents
on
the
wrong
basis,
namely;
we
will
get
your
services
because
we
pay
you
a
much
higher
rate
of
commission
not
because
we’re
serving
the
public
interest
by
better
ships,
better
accommodations
but
because
we’re
willing
to
pay
you
more
money”.
secondly,
another
concern
as
i
mentioned
was
the
question
of
protection
of
american
flag
minority,
the
unanimity
rule
is
designed
precisely
to
accomplish
that
and
the
proof
of
the
putting
there
is
this;
the
present
secretary
of
transportation,
when
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
pointed
out
that
the
unanimity
rule
currently
in
effect
in
iaac,
the
international
association
of
air
carriers,
was
insisted
upon
by
the
united
states
to
protect
the
right
of
each
individual
carriers.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
put
a
question
to
mr.
seibel,
asking
whether
a
majority
of
the
lines
supported
the
government’s
position
in
this
case.
i
think
mr.
seibel
interpreted
that
question
to
mean.
was
there
a
majority
of
lines
way
back
10
or
15
years
ago
in
favor
of
an
increase
in
commissions?
i
think
he
answered
the
question
“yes”
in
that
light
but
i’m
not
sure
that
there
may
not
be
some
confusion
here
as
to
where
the
conference
lines
stand
on
the
matters
before
the
court.
i
am
the
spokesman
here
for
all
the
lines
who
unanimously
agreed
that
the
commission
was
wrong
and
the
court
below
was
right.
in
other
words,
we
believe,
our
clients
believe,
that
the
two
rules
which
have
been
struck
down
by
the
commission
here
after
some
40
years
of
approval
strike
at
the
foundation
of
the
conferences
themselves.
we
agree
that
over
40
years
these
conferences
developed
barnacles
in
connection
with
the
supervision
and
control
of
agents
and
that
there
were
great
many
improvements
which
the
commission
ordered,
as
a
result
of
this
investigation,
many
of
which
the
conference
itself
had
recognized
and
it
began
to
do
something
about
it.
and
the
commission
agrees
here
that
all
of
this
was
done
and
that
only
matters
litigated
below,
which
were
the
focus
of
this
entire
inquiry
was
whether
this
unanimity
rule
and
this
conference
tying
rule
were
good
or
bad.
the
commission
condemned
them
as
bad
and
we
say
it
condemned
them
essentially
on
antitrust
principles,
not
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence.
and
we
say
that
on
the
first
opinion
below,
the
court
pointed
that
out.
as
mr.
justice
fortas
had
said,
he
told
the
agency,
you
have
applied
the
incorrect
standard
of
review.
and
when
it
came
back
to
the
court
the
second
time,
it
came
back
upon
the
same
record
and
we
believe
the
court
below
reversed
the
second
time,
to
answer
mr.
justice
black’s
question,
because
the
court
treated
the
commissions
re-written
report
on
remand
as
the
tacit
admission
that
on
this
record,
the
commission
could
come
up
with
nothing
better
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
did
i
think
the
court
had
authority
to
do
that?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
believe
it
did
and
i
believe
this
court
very
recently
in
a
case
exercised
that
authority
itself.
i
think
it
was
the
consolo
case
where
they
pointed
out
that
the
case
has
been
around
for
eight
years
and
while
we
could
send
that
back
to
the
commission
to
do
something,
we
think
we
are
just
as
competent
to
tell
from
the
record
here
what
was
right
and
dispose
off
it
finally.
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
will
remember
that
case
since
he
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
am
i?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
must
answer
that
the
commission
alone
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
making
the
factual
findings.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
i
believe
the
court
below
reversed
because
it
interpreted
the
commission’s
action
in
coming
back
simply
with
a
revised
argument
as
to
why
antitrust
principles
were
sufficient
here
to
condemn
these
rules
as
an
admission
that
the
only
question
that
had
to
be
decided
really
was
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
was
sufficient.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
certainly
do
not,
mr.
justice
white.
i
couldn’t
possibly
take
that
position.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
certainly
is,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
may
say
it
is
but
i
think
something
more
is
required.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
my
position
that
it
may
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
our
position
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
say
there
would
have
to
be
evidence
of
the
working
of
the
rule
in
practice,
in
accordance
with
the
evil
label
attached
to
it.
that
is
to
say
--
well,
let
me
try
to
explain
it
this
way.
aren’t
we
all
agreed
here
that
every
conference
agreement
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement,
is
it
not?
it’s
concert
of
action
on
matters
of
competition
which
are
under
our
domestic
antitrust
policy
would
be
unlawful
were
it
not
for
the
exception
granted
by
the
shipping
act.
i’m
sorry
if
i’m
not
--
i’m
trying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
then
i
must
have
misunderstood.
i
do
agree,
no.
1,
that
the
commission
should
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
every
agreement
is
a
matter
of
competitive
consequence,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
it
is.
and
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
we’re
talking
about
an
agreement
that’s
presented
to
the
commission
for
the
first
time
and
the
commission
has
asked
to
approve
the
xyz
conference
and
on
the
face
of
the
agreement
is
written,
we
agree
that
we
won’t
do
a
number
of
competitive
things
and
the
commission
can
see
right
from
the
face
of
that
agreement
that
of
course,
it
would
be
antitrust
violation
for
these
lines
to
agree
to
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
anticompetitive
–
that
it
is
an
anticompetitive
agreement.
now,
what
does
the
shipping
act
contemplate?
that
the
commission
should
say
that’s
an
anticompetitive
agreement;
it
is
bad
therefore,
we
will
disapprove
it.
now,
if
that
is
so,
why
do
we
have
a
shipping
act
with
an
antitrust
exemption
in
it?
isn’t
the
purpose
to
weigh
what
advantages
or
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
that
agreement
and
decide
that
even
though
it
is
anticompetitive,
we
will
approve
it.
and
this
is
what
i
think
the
commission
is
thus
practically
everyday.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
now
i
think
–
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
have
a
slight
disagreement
with
you
on
that,
your
honor,
because
a
public
interest
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
believe
it
is
in
this
respect
that
the
public
interest,
as
now
inserted
in
section
15
of
the
shipping
act,
and
that
standard
was
inserted
when
congress
passed
the
dual
rate
law
in
1961.
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
as
it
appears
in
the
shipping
act,
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
purposes
of
the
shipping
act.
i
think
this
court
in
numerous
cases
has
pointed
out
that
the
public
interest
in
the
regulatory
statute,
takes
it’s
meaning
from
the
context
of
the
statue.
it
isn’t
an
amorphous
concept
meaning,
that
because
the
effect
of
the
rule,
as
they
say,
is
to
restrain
travel
agents
in
some
way
that
that
is
bad
per
se
and
must
inevitably
be
condemned.
what
i’m
trying
to
point
out
and
i
hope
i
am
answering
your
honors’
question
is,
that
here
was
a
rule
approved
for
40
years.
one
would
have
thought
that
in
40
years
of
operation,
it
would
have
been
a
relatively
simple
matter
to
produce
evidence
that
this
rule
had
the
“harsh
restraints”
–
to
use
counsel’s
expression
here
this
morning
-–
that
they
charge
it
with
heavy
and
that
it
had
no
redeeming
feature
whatsoever.
and
we
are
saying,
as
the
two
dissenting
commissioner’s
pointed
out,
this
whole
question
of
the
competitive
necessity
or
the
competitive
advantage
versus
disadvantage
of
this
rule
was
not
explored
in
this
proceeding.
this
was
not,
as
they
say,
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
were
not
acquainted
with
every
jar
and
kettle
of
what
the
commission
said
it
was
going
to
do
to
us
when
it
ended
up
with
this
decision.
we
did
the
best
we
could
to
put
in
evidence,
to
counter
matters
and
issues
as
they
came
up
during
the
course
of
it
but
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
we
did
not.
we
assumed
when
the
commission
read
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
had
that
--
no,
your
honor,
i
can’t
say
that.
we
assumed
that
the
commission
had
the
duty
to
do
whatever
the
court
directed
it
to
do
and
to
reopen
the
proceeding
in
any
manner
that
was
appropriate
to
accomplish
that?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
the
commission
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
did
not.
the
commission
simply
said,
“we’ll
hold
an
oral
argument
and
we
want
each
party
to
point
out
first
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
the
form
of
the
proceeding
was
simply
we
would
comment.
it’s
in
the
record.
we
were
directed
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
we
did
not
ask,
your
honor.
we
were
directed
to
file
briefs
and
to
appear
for
oral
argument
and
to
specify
in
those
briefs,
by
reference,
the
specific
facts
relied
on
and
that’s
what
was
done.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
when
you
say
did
we
have
the
opportunity,
we
certainly
tried
through
conference
witnesses
and
through
such
documents
as
winan
to
justify,
if
you
can
put
up
that
way,
our
position
which
was
that
on
all
the
matters
in
issue
and
most
of
the
matters
related
to
the
matters
which
are
not
in
issue
here,
very
little
attention
was
paid
to
this
tying
rule.
most
of
the
attention
was
paid
to
the
unanimity
rule
in
the
proceeding
below
because
aster
was
the
vigorous
proponent
having
started
this
whole
thing
on
with
an
ultimatum
to
the
conference.
we
can
no
longer
abide
the
unanimity
rule
and
they
were
out
to
prove
that
that
unanimity
rule
prevented
the
travel
agents
from
getting
increased
commissions.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
examiner
found
that
those
arguments
or
the
evidence
offered
in
support
of
their
arguments
that
had
blocked
the
commission,
consideration
and
the
result
that
in
the
travel
agents
not
pushing
any
translation
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
the
commission
disagreed
with
that.
the
commission
disagreed
with
the
examiner.
but
we
say
what
the
commission
failed
to
establish
was,
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
there
would
have
been
an
increase
in
commissions,
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
that
increase
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
was
their
burden
to
establish
and
i
think,
yes
that
when
they
attacked
the
rule,
which
has
already
been
approved
that
it
is
their
burden
to
show
by
evidence
that
it
is
doing
what
they
say
it
is
doing.
and
that
is
why,
to
get
back
to
this
per
se
application
of
antitrust
principles,
i’m
saying
that
after
40
years
of
operation
under
a
rule,
if
it
was
as
bad
as
they
say
it
was,
that
they
ought
would
have
been
able
to
prove
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
don’t
question
they
had
the
right
to
change
it
but
i
say
that
surely,
it
shouldn’t
be
changed
on
an
arbitrary
basis.
i
say
the
application
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’d
say
that
--
here’s
what
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
alright,
i’m
trying
to
say
this,
they
had
the
burden
of
reaching
a
decision
upon
a
substantial
evidence.
that’s
all
i
am
saying
here.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
produce
whatever
evidence
we
had?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
burden
of
proof
put
on
us
to
show
--
you
might
say
to
show
that
the
rule
wasn’t
bad
despite
it’s
per
se
lingual
to
show
that
the
rule
wasn’t
bad.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
claim
we
did
whatever
we
could
to
demonstrate
it.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
say
we
did
what
we
were
required
to
do-
-
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
but
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
they
did
not
find
that,
your
honor.
they
said
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
said
we
showed
no
justification.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
wouldn’t
the
issue
be
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
think
that
perhaps
i’m
getting
put
into
a
position
here
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
this
and
it
simply
this,
that
the
commission
must
base
its
order
on
substantial
evidence
and
cannot
base
its
order
on
antitrust
principles
alone.
that’s
my
key
position.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
we
don’t
believe
it
is
our
burden
to
establish
the
substantial
evidence
by
which
the
commission
had
to
condemn
and/or
prove
the
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
right.
we
don’t
believe
it’s
our
burden
to
justify.
we
believe
that
the
justification
occurred
when
the
shipping
act
itself
was
enacted;
that
congress
found
the
justification
for
conferences
and
their
agreements
by
enacting
the
act
and
the
act
set
up
the
standards
the
commission
was
to
apply
in
judging
whether
an
agreement
was
entitled
to
or
not
entitled
to
antitrust
exemption
under
the
act.
that’s
our
position
in
essence.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
burden.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
it
was
the
commission’s
burden
to
see
to
it
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
its
order
and
that
if
it’s
order
is
not
substantially
supported,
it
must
be
set
aside.
it
isn’t
a
question
of
burden
of
proof.
they
say
this
isn’t
a
trial.
we
don’t
have
a
burden
proof
unless
we
are
defending
as
we
would
do
in
the
trial.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
so
based
on
the
legislative
history.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
we
lost
in
that
case,
we
would
be
lose
here.
well,
i
am
afraid
--
i
don’t
know
what
would
happen
here,
your
honor,
and
like
crystal
ball
is
not
that
clear.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry.
i
want
to
say
that
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
shipping
is
examined
originally
as
adopted
by
congress
in
1916
and
as
it’s
intentions
and
purposes
were
affirmed
when
the
dual
rate
law
amended
that
act
in
1961,
it
is
very
clear
that
when
congress
itself
devised
the
standards
by
which
competitive
agreements
are
to
be
judged,
this
court,
in
the
carnation
case,
itself
pointed
out
that
the
language
of
that
provision,
referring
to
section
16,
must
have
been
selected
as
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
in
order
to
indicate
the
extent
to
which
the
industry’s
rate-making
activities
remain
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
as
well
as
to
the
extent
to
which
those
activities
are
exempted
from
antitrust
regulation.
and,
i’m
saying,
for
the
commission
to
come
in
and
say
“you
have
an
anticompetitive
agreement
here”
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry;
it’s
the
beginning
of
it.
it
is
the
beginning
of
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
that
anticompetitive
agreement
on
its
face
is
as
bad
as
it
might
be
deemed
to
be
if
we
were
applying
domestic
antitrust
concepts
to
this
area
of
international
commerce.
this
area
of
international
commerce,
as
congress
has
clearly
pointed
out,
is
not
one
in
which
our
domestic
antitrust
concepts,
traditional
concepts
can
be
fully
applied.
the
atlantic
ocean
is
an
area
of
free
trade
for
all
nations
of
the
world.
it
is
true
that
when
the
shipping
conferences
or
vessels
–
which
represent
those
nations,
there’s
some
15
nations
represented
in
this
conference.
when
they
get
together
and
form
a
conference
and
ask
for
exemption
from
our
antitrust
laws,
we
don’t
say
that
they
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
some
antitrust
regulation
but
we
say
that
congress
carefully
marked
out
what
the
limits
of
the
antitrust
application
was
to
be
and
the
antitrust
application
was
phrased
in
terms
of,
do
you,
the
commission,
find
this
agreement
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
if
you
do
disapprove
it
but
if
you
don’t,
it
is
not
left
to
your
discretion?
“whether
to
approve
or
disapprove,
you
shall
approve
all
other
agreements”,
says
congress.
secondly,
do
you
find
this
agreement
contrary
to
the
public
interest?
if
you
do,
disapprove
it
but
if
you
don’t
find
it
so,
you
must
approve
it.
the
same
goes,
whether
it’s
discriminatory,
unjustly
discriminatory
as
between
carriers
or
whether
it
violates
some
other
provisions
of
the
act
such
as
section
14.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
should
think
that
would
be
--
are
you
saying
the
terms
of
the
agreement
or
that
the
agreement
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
that
if
the
agreement
stopped
with
that,
that
they
would
only
carry
the
steel
of
united
states
steel,
that
would
run
squarely
a
foul
of
that
section
which
says
you
can’t
approve
an
agreement
which
is
unjustly
discriminatory
to
import
as
or
export
as
in
that
sort
of
thing.
you
have
to
worry
about
public
interest
thing.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
again
is
this;
i
think
that
congress
has
said,
“if
the
commission
finds
that
an
agreement
operates
contrary
to
one
or
more
of
the
statutory
standards,
then
it
shall
disapprove
the
agreement.
i
don’t
think
the
question
is
really
one
a
burden
of
proof.
i
think
it
is
one
of
whether
when
the
commission
makes
the
finding,
the
finding
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
if
that
is
so.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
i
have
to
respectfully
differ
with
that
because
i
believe
that
what
your
honor
is
saying
here
is
that
ordinary
rules
of
burden
of
proof
as
applicable
in
a
court
of
law
and
adversary
proceedings
shall
apply
to
the
commission’s
determinations
when
it
is
exercising
the
responsibility
placed
on
it
by
the
shipping
act.
and
i’m
saying
that
when
the
act
was
amended
to
insert
the
contrary
to
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
15,
the
commission
itself
told
the
congress
that
it
did
not
want
that
standard
expressed
in
a
way
which
required
the
commission
to
affirmatively
find
that
an
agreement
was
in
the
public
interest
before
it
could
approve
it.
now,
that
was
the
way
the
house
had
originally
passed
its
bill
to
amend
section
15
and
we
cite
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
the
commission
said
there
are
many
times
when
conferences
come
forward
with
agreements
which
we
couldn’t
find
to
serve
any
public
interest
purpose
but
we
don’t
want
to
be
--
but
these
agreements
do
not
violate
one
of
the
standards
of
the
act.
we
don’t
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
affirmatively
find
that
these
agreements
are
in
the
public
interest.
we
wanted
phrased
in
the
conventional
terms
that
these
agreements
shall
be
approved
unless
we
find
them
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
the
senate,
the
house
itself
then
amended
its
original
bill
to
incorporate
the
language
in
that
form.
the
senate
made
a
slight
change
so
that
it
appears
as
it
now
does
you
must
--
you
shall
disapprove
agreements
which
would
operate
to
the
depth
of
commerce
and
which
are
contrary
to
public
interest
operate
unjustly
or
discriminate
unjustly,
etcetera.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think,
i’ll
have
to
say
i
know
of
no
other
but
i
know
of
no
other
industry
that
doesn’t
also
happen
to
be
fully
within
the
control
of
a
united
states
regulatory
agency.
that
is
to
say
the
shipping
act
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
the
atlantic
ocean
is
not
our
lake;
that
it
happens
to
be
an
ocean,
which
is
as
much
--
has
as
much
commercial
interest
for
other
nations
of
the
world
as
it
has
for
the
united
states.
that
is
to
say
our
foreign
commerce
can
also
be
the
foreign
commerce
of
another
nation.
and,
congress,
in
enacting
the
act,
recognized
that
the
only
in
which
destructive
competition
which
experience
had
taught
was
the
kind
of
competition
that
resulted
when
there
wasn’t
a
voluntary
self-regulation;
that
that
kind
of
competition
was
bad
for
the
public
interest;
that
it
resulted
in
cut
throat
practices,
under
handed
agreements,
deprive
the
public
of
regularity
and
dependability
of
service
and
stability
of
rates
and
congress
said
the
only
way
we
cannot
accomplish
this
is
to
get
these
carriers
to
agree
to
enter
conferences,
which
will
be
subjected
to
the
supervision
of
a
regulatory
agency
that
we
set
up
under
reasonable
standards
of
regulation.
and,
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
that
when
an
antitrust
concept
per
se
illegality
is
applied
to
a
conference
agreement
or
rule
as
the
case
may
be,
we
are
applying
our
traditional
antitrust
concepts
in
their
full
vigor
contrary
to
what
congress
said
should
be
done
in
this
particularly
industry.
now,
therefore,
i
say
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
am
well
aware
of
that
ordinary
rule.
to
me,
that
is
an
ordinary
antitrust
rule
domestically
namely;
that
he
who
seeks
the
benefit
of
an
exemption
from
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
it’s
a
domestic
operation,
your
honor.
it
is
not
an
international
shipping
operation.
the
railroads
are
fully
subject
to
the
control
of
our
regulatory
agents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
icc
has
much
broader
powers.
in
fact,
the
icc
is
entitled
to
disregard
the
anticompetitive
effects
at
it
did
in
the
recent
case,
i
think
the
denvery
o’grand
case
where
a
merger
was
approved
which
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
served
the
public
interest
from
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
denvery
o’grand
case.
i
believe
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
didn’t
mean
it
in
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
override
them
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
based
on
some
evidence.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
and
i
am
saying
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
and
i
am
saying
that
what
the
commission
refers
to
here
as
a
per
se
group
boycott
could
be
overwritten
by
--
that
is
to
say
there
could
be
evidence
and
there
could
be
reason
and
we
say
there
was
neither
reason
or
evidence
here
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
per
se
illegal
and
that
as
the
dissenting
commissioners
pointed
out,
that
subject
was
not
even
explored.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
may
i
--
right.
and,
your
honor
has
stated
exactly
our
position
that
the
question
here
is
basically
--
was
the
court
below
correct
in
its
view
of
this,
in
its
appraisal
of
this
record
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
what
was
done.
but
i
would
like
to
add,
so
long
as
we
are
talking
about
reasons,
why
this
tying
ruleserves
a
reasonable
purpose.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
two-fold
standpoint,
the
tying
ruleis
a
rule
where
by
certain
selected
agents,
travel
agents,
traditionally
serving
the
steamship
trade,
have
been
appointed
by
the
lines
as
their
agents
sort
of
exclusive
dealing
arrangement.
they
are
not
just
any
agent.
they
were
carefully
selected
agents.
and
in
the
early
days
of
shipping
here,
many
of
these
selections
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
since
so
many
nations
of
the
world
come
here,
they
are
selected
on
a
nationality
basis,
for
example.
and
why
are
they
selected?
because
of
their
nationality
and
other
ties;
they
control
traffic.
they
control
the
passengers.
just
as
in
the
dual
rate
system,
the
conference
gives
a
lower
rate
to
get
the
exclusive
patronage
of
the
shippers
who
are
going
to
commit
the
transportation
of
their
goods
to
the
conference
carriers
for
the
benefit
they
received.
these
agents
do
receive
benefits
as
to
say
it’s
not
enough.
we
think
otherwise.
but
the
point
is,
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
commission
didn’t
agree
with
aster
to
this
extent.
aster
had
said
to
the
commission,
the
7%
commission
rate
that
these
lines
are
paying
us
is
an
unlawful,
non-compensatory
rate.
the
commission
said
on
this
record,
we
cannot
make
that
finding.
we
cannot
find
it’s
unreasonably
low.
we
cannot
find
agents
are
losing
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
evidence
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
shows
they
are
holding
their
own
even
vis-à-vis
airlines;
that
more
and
more
agents
are
applying
for
conference
appointment
obviously
not
terribly
concerned
about
group
boycotts.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
findings
were
made
with
respect
to
the
tying
ruleby
the
examiner
uncontested.
no
agent
ever
lost
his
appointment
because
of
the
tying
rule.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i’m
saying
--
i
was
about
to
give
you
some
reasons.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
and
here’s
what
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
don’t
want
you
to
disagree
with
the
commission
at
all.
i
very
much
like
you
to
agree
with
the
court
below
and
i
suppose
you
have
to
undertake
now
a
de
novo
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right,
on
the
basis
of
no
substantial
evidence.
but
what
i
was
about
to
say
was,
that
the
commission
brushed
aside
the
tying
rule
by
saying
to
us,
“you
don’t
have
one
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
we
don’t
have
a
conference
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade
and
the
reason
we
don’t
have
a
conference
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade
is
that
it
differs
essentially
in
character
from
the
trans-atlantic
passenger
trade.
it
wasn’t
investigated
but
it’s
common
knowledge
that
steamships
come
and
go
in
the
cruise
trade.
they
commit
themselves
to
no
regularity
and
frequency
of
service.
they
frequently
cancel
sailings.
they
go
where
they
make
money.
the
conference
is
necessary
because
in
it,
a
group
of
carriers
agree
that
all
year
long,
good
season,
bad
season,
they
will
maintain
a
regular
service
across
the
atlantic.
that
means
that
while
they
can
fill
their
ships
in
the
summer
months
when
it’s
pleasant
to
travel,
eight
or
nine
months
of
the
year,
they
must
go
over
with
more
crew
than
they
have
passengers.
so,
it
is
essential
to
them
to
try
to
assure,
just
as
the
cargo
vessels
must
assure,
the
loyalty
of
the
merchants,
if
you
can
call
them
at
upon
--
on
their
patronage
depends.
so
the
tying
rule
and
it’s
set
forth
that
it’s
not
absolute.
it
says
you
can’t
do
it
without
permission
but
they
say
the
record
shows
it’s
enforced.
the
tying
rule
ties
these
selected
travel
agents
to
the
patronage
of
these
lines
all
year
long
so
the
lines
can
try
to
fill
their
ships
with
these
many
passengers
in
four
season
as
they
can
to
be
able
to
maintain
the
financial
stability
they
need
in
order
to
provide
the
regularity
of
service,
and
frequency
of
service,
and
dependability
which
is
in
the
public
interest.
that’s
point
one.
the
other
point
is
this;
if
you
say
a
travel
agent
is
no
longer
tied
to
the
conference,
what
happens
to
the
conference?
why
should
a
line
remain
in
a
conference
if
it
can
get
these
agents
without
having
to
belong
to
the
conference?
and
therefore,
we
get
down
into
some
fundamental
philosophy.
we
say
that
congress
recognized
that
conferences
were
justifiable,
that
they
were
desirable
though
they
had
abuses
and
needed
regulation
and
that
the
only
way
they
could
effectively
exist
was
to
give
them
reasons
why
they
should
be.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
saying
they
would.
i’m
saying
a
strong
inducement
for
keeping
the
lines
in
the
conference
would
be
lost.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
maintain
it
is.
we
maintain
it
is
a
fundamental
rule
of
a
passenger
conference.
your
honor
will
remember
that
the
dual
rate
decision
of
this
court,
1958,
created
a
tremendous
furor
in
the
shipping
industry
because
it
was
pointed
out
that
most
of
the
trade
conferences
depend
upon
the
dual
rate
contract
system
as
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
based
on
their
trade
that’s
why
they
aren’t.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
it’s
a
violation
of
law
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
it’s
a
violation
of
the
shipping
act
--
that’s
what
we’re
saying.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
and
even
if
it
shown
to
be
such
by
substantial
evidence,
our
goose
is
cooked.
that’s
really
what
we
say.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
agency
found
that
these
two
rules
should
be
condemned
as
violative
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
that
conference
--
i’m
not
prepared
to
represent
that
to
the
court.
i’m
simply
saying
that
in
a
passenger
conference
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
conference
also
regulates
rates.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
only
telling,
your
honor,
that
the
alexander
report,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
the
control
of
agency
forces
was
a
principal
object
of
a
passenger
conference.
remember,
a
freight
conference’s
principal
reason
for
being
is
the
control
of
freight
rates.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
uniformity
of
passenger
fares
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
it
is
in
a
way
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
is
in
a
way.
i
have
to
agree
to
that.
and,
i’m
not
saying
that
there
wouldn’t
be
other
reasons
but
i’m
saying
this;
that
a
strong
inducement
for
remaining
in
the
conference
is
the
existence
of
the
tying
rule
and
also
of
this
unanimity
rule.
and
i
didn’t
have
time
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
are
reasons
also
why
the
unanimity
rule
should
not
have
been
condemned
out
of
hand
in
this
way
and
that
is
this.
congress,
in
the
1961
legislative
debate
over
the
dual
rate
law,
pointed
out
that
in
most
conferences
the
american
flag
lines
represent
a
small
minority.
in
these
conferences,
there
are
two
american
lines
in
one,
three
in
the
other.
now
if
you
say
or
as
the
commission
does,
that
such
matters
is
the
rate
of
commission
which
is
after
all
a
financial
matter
that
enters
into
the
general
financial
picture
of
each
line
may
be
fixed
by
a
dominant
group
majority.
you
are
up
to
leave
the
small
minority
american
flag
lines
right
out
in
the
cold
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
unanimity
rule
on
a
matter
of
this
sort
is
to
see
to
it
that
each
line
has
an
effective
participation
in
determining
the
area
of
competition
on
which
it
is
willing
to
agree.
it
means,
in
other
words,
that
if
you
say
that
rate
of
commission
may
be
fixed
by
a
so-called
“majority”
that
smaller
lines
with
less
resources
could
be
driven
out
of
the
trade
because
they
could
not
meet
the
higher
rate
of
commission
that
a
more
financially
affluent
line
could
afford
to
pay.
and
the
whole
idea
of
the
conference,
repugnant
as
it
may
sound
to
some,
is
to
try
to
stabilize
that
rate
of
commission
which
all
are
willing
to
live
with.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
my
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
no.
1,
factually,
based
on
the
record,
it
is
inaccurate
to
this
extent.
the
record
shows
there
were
but
four
lines
in
this
conference
which
call
that
canadian
ports,
rather
than
united
states
ports
on
their
travels
from
europe,
tour
from
europe.
on
the
four
lines,
one
of
them
is
a
major
competitor
of
the
american
lines
--
that
is
canadian
pacific
station,
which
sells
substantial
thousands
of
bookings
here
in
the
u.s.
because
--
while
it
is
in
the
record,
it’s
a
common
knowledge
--
a
person
living
in
the
middle
west
of
the
united
states
can
fly
as
easily
to
montreal
and
get
a
ship
to
europe
as
he
can
to
new
york.
and,
historically,
and
this
is
something
the
examiners
seem
to
have
overlooked,
although
it
is
well
documented
in
the
alexander
report,
there
has
never
been
a
separate
trade
between
canada
and
europe
and
between
the
united
states
and
europe
because
first
of
all
the
ports
of
canada,
the
seaports
of
canada
which
are
used
for
passenger
trade
are
geographically
contiguous
to
those
of
the
atlantic,
north
atlantic
ports
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
think
there
are
three
lines,
there
were
three
lines
at
that
time
that
had
--
that
did
not
call
at
u.s.
ports
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
or
they
call
it
canadian
ports.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh,
i’m
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
all
lines
call
a
canadian
port
or
that
another
line,
all
conference
members
call
either
at
canadian
ports
or
united
states
ports.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
regularly,
that’s
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
times
when
canadian
lines
do
the
weather
in
canada
must
use
u.s.
ports.
that’s
right.
and
now
that
the
seaway
was
open,
you
have
many
lines
going
through
into
the
great
lakes;
some
of
these
canadian
lines
now
do
that.
the
point
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
conference
agreement,
the
only
trade,
the
atlantic
passenger
trade
viewed
north
america
as
the
terminus
on
the
western
end
and
that
included
the
canada
and
the
u.s.
the
american
society
of
travel
agent
itself
reflects
that
because
it
includes
the
agents
of
both
countries
in
its
organization.
it
elects
even
once
in
a
while
a
canadian
as
president
of
its
organization
and
has
directives
from
there.
but
the
point
is,
that
there
is
no
separate
trade.
the
conference
covers
the
trade
as
a
historical
unity
growing
out
of
geographical
and
economic
factors.
so
there
is
no
rational
basis,
really
for
excluding
even
this
minimum
number
as
having
no
interest
in
the
trade
as
distinguished
from
interest
in
what
might
be
termed
“exclusively
u.s.
foreign
commerce”.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
ultimate
sanction,
i
would
say,
is
the
adoption
of
regulations
that
the
foreign
lines
are
voluntarily
willing
to
accept.
now,
that
may
seem
extreme
but
i
mean
reasonable
regulations
that
they
are
prepared
and
when
i
say
“they”,
with
the
acquiescence
of
their
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
dual
rate
law
was
proposed,
the
congress,
the
house
had
put
some
provisions
in
that
bill
which
our
department
of
state
said
represented
an
intrusion,
an
attempt
to
intrude
the
jurisdiction
of
our
government
into
matters
which
will
beyond
his
jurisdiction,
namely
saying
to
anyone
before
you
may
belong
to
a
conference
and
obtain
the
benefit
of
our
antitrust
law,
you
must
agree
in
advance
to
subject
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
our
courts.
now
many
foreign
governments
found
this
extremely
repugnant
because
they
didn’t
believe,
as
i
say,
that
the
only
commerce
on
the
atlantic
ocean
was
that
of
the
united
states.
maritime
nations
of
long
standing
like
great
britain
and
the
germany
and
other
countries
were
very
much
opposed
to
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
all
i’m
saying
here
is
that
congress
has
made
clear
that
our
traditional
antitrust
concepts
cannot
be
fully
applied
to
this
area
of
commerce.
i
am
saying,
in
other
words,
that
decisions
in
this
area
must
be
tempered
by
a
recognition
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
domestic
antitrust
scene.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
this
agreement
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i’m
not
at
all
to
get
assured
that
the
board
of
trade
of
london
would
agree
that
this
industry
is
governed
by
constitution
the
united
states
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that’s
what
congress
was
pointing
out.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
alright,
i’m
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
disagreeing
with
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
i’m
not
trying
to
do
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
cartel
as
i
know
of
that
often
evokes
impressions
of
something
evil
and
to
be
--
shall
we
say
driven
out
of
existence.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
not
to
make
any
exception
in
the
even
handed
administration
of
the
shipping
act
because
simply
because
some
of
the
travel
agents
that
served
the
conference
happen
to
be
located
in
the
united
states.
i
certainly
do
agree
that
if
the
commission
were
to
find
by
substantial
evidence
that
travel
agents
here
were
suffering
something
that
they
shouldn’t
be
obliged
to
suffer
because
of
what
this
conference
agreement
was
doing
to
them
or
permitting
to
be
done
to
them.
i
certainly
agree
100%
with
the
idea
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
strike
it
down
and
should
strike
it
down.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
in
this
record,
you
will
find
that
i
believe
as
the
court,
as
far
judges
as
you
pointed
out
yourself
below
did
not
find
it.
it
was
raised
on
the
basis
that
it
was
per
se
illegal
despite,
as
i
say,
40
years
of
operation
in
which
one
would
have
thought
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
really
regret
that
there
seems
to
be
this
misunderstanding
because
certainly
it
is
not
my
intention
to
advance
theories
or
positions
here
which
in
anyway
militate
against
the
power
of
an
agency
of
this
government
to
do
what
it
is
called
upon
to
do
to
protect
our
citizens,
our
commercial
interest.
that’s
not
what
i’m
saying.
i’m
simply
saying
that
i
believe
the
spirit
or
the
purpose
or
the
limits
that
have
been
imposed
upon
this
industry
were
imposed
by
congress
in
the
shipping
act
and
that
the
legislative
history
is
fairly
clear
that
congress
recognized
that
there
was
a
unique
area
of
international
trade
involved
here
in
which
a
certain
accommodation
had
to
be
made,
as
this
court
itself
referred
to
it
in
the
carnation
case
--
that
it
was
an
accommodation
of
conflicting
interest
between
foreign
maritime
nations
and
our
desire,
the
demands
of
our
domestic
antitrust
policy,
which
of
course
favors
free
competition
which
strikes
down
anything
that
imposes
unnecessary,
unreasonable
restraints
on
people.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
have
to
say
it
would.
i
mean,
if
we’re
talking
about
the
idea
that
what
is
it?
it’s
a
concert
of
action
by
competitors
in
effect
to
fix
the
price,
if
you
call
it,
that
the
price
they
will
pay
for
a
service.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
because
i
think
that
applying
that
notion
of
requiring
someone
who
claims
an
exemption
from
antitrust
laws
to
come
forward
and
show
he
is
entitled
to
it,
is
not
the
way
congress
has
said
the
shipping
act
shall
be
administered.
the
shipping
act
doesn’t
say
the
commission
may
approve
an
agreement.
it
says
it
must
approve
it
unless
it
finds
one,
two,
three,
four.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
that
substantial
evidence
must
be
the
basis
for
its
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
is
perfectly
clear,
i
believe
that
the
antitrust
evasion
is
seeking
to
reargue
here
a
battle
it
lost
before
congress
in
1961
when
it
was
trying
to
convince
congress
that
antitrust
provision
should
be
incorporated
in
the
amendments
to
the
shipping
act
which
were
then
adopted.
now,
why
weren’t
they.
senator
claire
angel,
who
was
the
manager
of
this
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
house
of
the
senate.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
i’m
quoting
now
from
the
senate
document
no.100,
which
is
the
index
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
steamship
conference
dual
rate
law.
it’s
a
convenient
abiding
which
contains
everything
including
the
reports
referred
to
in
our
brief.
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
this;
congress
was
concerned
with
two
things.
no.
1,
if
it
was
going
to
authorize
or
confirm
that
steamship
conferences
and
the
activities
there
under
were
to
be
lawful.
those
conferences
must
be
able
to
be
affected.
they
must
have
as
it
was
put
effective
tying
arrangements.
secondly,
if
they
were
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
there
must
be
protection
for
the
american
flag
minority
which
congress
pointed
out
with
a
high
cost
operators
who
couldn’t
compete
on
a
dollar
for
dollar
basis
with
lower
courts
europeans.
and
senator
angel
said,
the
reason
that
these
antitrust
amendments
or
proposals
advanced
by
the
department
of
justice
were
not
adopted.
he
put
it
in
rather
colorful
language.
he
said,
“we
found
it
wholly
impossible”
-
this
is
page
462
of
the
book
i
just
mentioned
–
“to
authorize
what
amounted
to
a
quasi
monopoly
or
a
semi-monopoly
and
then
turn
around
and
de-authorize
it.
there
was
simply
no
way
to
go.
in
other
words,
to
march
up
the
hill
and
say
they
were
lawful,
and
then
march
down
again
and
adopt
things
that
would
make
them
unlawful.
and
as
i
say,
the
tying
rule
of
this
passenger
conference
is
precisely
the
effective
kind
of
tying
arrangement
that
is
of
importance
in
keeping
this
conference
together
as
a
conference
and
eliminating
competition
for
travel
agents
on
the
wrong
basis,
namely;
we
will
get
your
services
because
we
pay
you
a
much
higher
rate
of
commission
not
because
we’re
serving
the
public
interest
by
better
ships,
better
accommodations
but
because
we’re
willing
to
pay
you
more
money”.
secondly,
another
concern
as
i
mentioned
was
the
question
of
protection
of
american
flag
minority,
the
unanimity
rule
is
designed
precisely
to
accomplish
that
and
the
proof
of
the
putting
there
is
this;
the
present
secretary
of
transportation,
when
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
pointed
out
that
the
unanimity
rule
currently
in
effect
in
iaac,
the
international
association
of
air
carriers,
was
insisted
upon
by
the
united
states
to
protect
the
right
of
each
individual
carriers.
thank
you,
your
honors.
