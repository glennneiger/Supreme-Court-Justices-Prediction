the
technical

that

power

any
agreement

any

thereof

not
a

the

i

these
are

you
don’t

how
does

go

you
do
disagree
whether
the
estimation
did
conclude
that
there

factors
in

indicated
that
public
interest
requires

approval

justice

i
know
but
i’m
just
saying
that
you
gave
the
reasons
to
the

as
i
take
it,

disagreed

yup,
i
understand
that
your
argument
as
a
general
proposition.
but
as
i
understood
here,
a
good
deal
of
the
commission’s
basis
for
its
holding
with
respect
to
unanimity
rule
was
that
of
the
25
members
of
this
conference,
7
of
them
had
at
behest
a
peripheral
connection
with
the
united
states

and
therefore,
no
real
interest
in
what
united

and
canadian
travel

should
be
paid.

i’m
