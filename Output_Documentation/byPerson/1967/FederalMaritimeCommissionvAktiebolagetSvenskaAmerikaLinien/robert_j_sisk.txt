mr.
robert
j.
sisk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
no.
258,
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
concurs
in
the
views
expressed
by
the
united
states
government
and
at
this
time,
we
would
like
to
add
some
additional
points
and
answer
some
of
the
questions
which
your
honors
have
raised.
in
the
light
of
the
prospective
we
have
acquired
after
a
living
with
this
case
for
more
than
ten
years.
first,
let
me
identify
as
to
the
american
society
of
travel
agents,
it
is
the
principle
of
the
trade
association
of
independent
travel
agents
in
the
united
states
and
for
anyone
who
has
been
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
the
opportunity
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
agents
but
we
say
that
there
are
people
who
sell
and
promote
travel
of
all
kinds,
ocean,
rail,
air
and
bus,
they
create
and
sell
tours;
they
get
no
payment
generally
by
the
public
but
rely
for
their
livelihood
on
commissions
paid
by
the
carriers
and
by
hotels.
according
to
the
survey
made
by
the
government
in
this
case,
in
exhibit
“40”,
they
are
generally
small
businessman.
they
are
individual
entrepreneurs.
they
are
not
employees
although
the
lines,
the
respondents
here,
regard
them
as
their
principal
sales
force.
they
are
nevertheless
forbidden
by
the
national
labor
laws
to
combine
to
act
collectively.
they
are
also
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws
to
act
collectively.
we
did
bring
this
complaint
as
mr.
seibel
has
stated.
in
1958,
very
reluctantly
before
the
federal
maritime
board
--
reluctantly
because
the
agents
have
long
had
great
loyalty
to
these
lines
--
they
were
agents
for
these
lines
long
before
the
wright
brothers
began
to
experiment
with
air
flight.
nevertheless,
after
having
heard
for
many
years
the
old
story
that
they
have
rules
which
dated
back
to
1879
and
rules
which
prevented
any
change
in
their
formed
act
because
they
couldn’t
unanimity,
and
after
making
every
effort
to
persuade
the
lines,
to
change
their
rules
and
having
failed
and
in
post
war
period
when
the
competition
of
airlines
began
to
prove,
that
these
carriers
were
heading
for
disaster
and
were
too
inflexible
to
change
to
adopt
to
the
changing
economic
conditions
asked
about
its
complaint
before
the
then
federal
maritime
board,
which
led
to
this
investigation
in
1959.
and
as
mr.
seibel
stated,
it
was
the
first
investigation
of
how
these
respondents
collectively
treat
travel
agents
and
it
was
comprehensive.
it
led
to
a
three-week
hearing
in
new
york
city
in
1961
to
a
report
by
the
examiner
in
1963
to
a
first
commission
order
in
1964,
a
first
court
of
appeals
remand
in
1965,
a
second
commission
order
where
we
again
had
to
a
brief
and
argue
the
entire
case
and
this
time
before
a
new
member
of
the
commission
and
convince
him
to
join
with
the
majority
and,
finally,
to
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1967.
now,
the
principal
argument
advanced
by
the
respondents
here
in
their
brief
is
that
there
just
isn’t
enough
evidence
to
sustain
what
the
commission
did
and
this
is
getting
to
the
point
which
mr.
justice
fortas
has
raised.
well
as
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
respondents
are
seeking
to
apply
here
a
very
rigid
evidentiary
standard,
one
which
may
be
applicable
to
a
situation
in
which
an
agency
acts
in
a
quasi-judicial
function
but
which
has
no
application
to
an
agency
in
its
regulatory
function.
in
addition
to
the
american
airline
c.a.b.
case,
in
the
court
below
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
which
the
distinction
between
the
forms
of
agency
action
is
very
clearly
spelled
out,
we
note
that
this
court
has
spelled
out
its
views
on
the
subject
of
regulatory
action
by
agencies.
in
the
case
of
the
federal
communications
commission
against
pottsville
broadcasting
at
309
u.s.
134
in
which
it
was
held
that
it
was
improper
for
an
appellate
court
to
apply
trial
court
standards
to
agency
regulatory
action.
and
again
in
mcclean
trucking
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
25,
this
court
has
held
that
it
was
proper
for
an
agency
to
speculate
as
to
future
consequences
and
effects
that
it
should
make
its
judgment
based
on
available
present
facts
and
on
its
past
experience.
well,
the
available
present
fact
here
were
we
submit
sufficient
despite
a
deliberate
policy
by
respondents
as
found
by
everybody
who
has
issued
findings
with
respect
to
this
case,
a
deliberate
policy
on
their
part
to
avoid
governmental
review,
adapted
and
adopted
out
of
fear
of
the
american
antitrust
laws.
that
was
an
uncontested
finding.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
earlier
to
mr.
seibel
with
respect
to
the
taking
of
additional
evidence;
and
this
also
bears
on
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
believe
that
no
additional
evidence
was
needed
and
nobody
ever
asked
for
it
because
primarily
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
agency
even
between
the
examiner
and
the
commission
as
to
the
underlying
evidentiary
facts.
the
examiner
found
that
unanimity
rule
had
blocked
changes
in
commissions
and
he
found
that
there
had
been
detriment
to
the
lines.
where
he
different
from
the
commission
was
solely
with
respect
to
the
remedy.
he
thought
the
remedy
for
this
diversion
by
the
agents
was
to
pass
a
rule
prohibiting
diversion.
we
could
call
this
a
prohibition
law
and
it
would
probably
have
had
about
as
much
a
success
as
our
national
prohibition
law.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
well,
the
court
was
wrong,
your
honor,
in
our
view
because
it
was
applying
a
standard
of
review
which
this
court
has
subsequently
held
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
no,
the
court
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency
with
respect
to
the
remedy.
the
court
said,
we
find
the
reasoning
of
the
examiner
more
persuasive
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
the
examiner
having
suggested
that
the
remedy
to
be
applied
was
to
pass
a
rule.
but
this
was
one
of
the
court’s
principal
objections
to
the
commission’s
report
and
i
point
out
to
your
honors,
that
the
opinion
written
by
the
court
below
was
written
by
judge
george
washington,
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
consolo
against
the
federal
maritime
commission
which
this
court
reversed
for
applying
an
incorrect
standard
of
review.
consolo
was
reversed
by
this
court
one
year
after
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
so
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
issues
before
it,
it
was
applying
the
wrong
administrative
standard
of
review.
now,
with
respect
to
your
honors’
question
as
to
what
findings
there
were,
all
of
the
people
who
have
heard
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
examiner
and
the
commission
found
that
the
unanimity
rule
have
blocked
changes
in
commissions,
found
that
agents
were
diverting
travelers
to
the
airlines.
the
sole
issue
was
what
to
do
about
it.
the
examiner
thought
you
prohibited.
the
commission
thought
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
is
to
let
the
lines
be
free
to
exercise
their
business
judgment,
unfettered
by
the
veto
power
of
the
unanimity
rule.
in
addition,
the
examiner
had
another
remedy.
he
thought
that
you
could
disqualify
the
seven
lines
who
do
not
serve
united
states
ports
from
voting,
disenfranchise
them
completely.
the
commission’s
remedy
was
to
let
them
have
a
vote
but
do
away
with
their
veto
power.
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
really
quarrel
with
the
evidence.
it
said,
“we
find
the
reasoning
of
the
examiner
as
to
the
remedy
more
persuasive.
this
was
a
substitution
of
the
court’s
judgment
for
that
of
a
commission.
and
we
make
this
point
historically
because
when
it
finally
went
from
the
court
of
appeals
back
to
commission,
who
wrote
a
very
extensive
and
very
learned
opinion,
the
second
time
around,
detailing
all
of
the
points
on
which
it
relied
and
it
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
might
say
that
respondents
elected
to
bring
the
case
even
though
they
are
located
in
new
york
and
even
though
the
case
was
tried
in
new
york
before
hearing
examined
there
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
they
had
their
choice
of
courts.
they
elected
to
bring
it
before
the
court
of
appeals
presumably
because
it
was
applying
a
pre-consolo
standard
of
review
and
they
thought
they
had
their
best
chance
to
success
there
and
one
can’t
quarrel
with
an
advocate
for
doing
that
but
it
was
the
wrong
standard
of
review.
as
i
said,
the
court
below
incorporated
in
its
brief
opinion,
in
the
case
which
is
before
your
honors
today.
its
earlier
opinion
saying
that
the
doubts
and
problems
they’ve
pointed
out
in
their
earlier
opinion
prevent
them
from
affirming
the
court
below.
but
as
i’ve
indicated,
since
that
opinion
was
based
on
a
pre
consolo
test,
it
was
error.
and,
moreover,
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
reject
the
application
of
antitrust
principles.
the
proposition
that
antitrust
principle
should
not
be
considered
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
lies
in
the
face
of
a
line
of
cases
in
this
court
beginning
with
mcclean
trucking
and
running
down
through
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
as
recently
as
denver
and
real
gram
western
railroad.
the
tenor
of
those
cases
is
that
regulatory
agencies
must
evaluate
collective
action
and
must
weigh
anticompetitive
considerations
and
try
to
reconcile
the
competing
statutory
schemes.
and
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
at
page
364,
this
court
held
that
the
exchange
would
be
violating
the
antitrust
laws
“unless
justified”
by
reference
to
the
securities
and
exchange
laws.
so
the
principle
to
call
upon
a
proponent
of
an
anticompetitive
rule
for
justification
has
been
accepted
by
this
court.
now
we
submit
that
the
maritime
commission
applied
no
per
se
rule
or
test.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
respondent
simply
failed
to
produce
any
evidence
of
need
or
any
other
justification
whatsoever.
we
need
not,
i
believe,
belabor
the
importance
of
this
principle
to
the
regulation
by
government
agencies
generally
in
dealing
with
antitrust
exemptions.
in
our
view,
there
can
be
no
practical
way
to
administer
the
shipping
act
or
any
other
regulatory
act
if
the
agency
cannot
require
the
proponent
of
the
rule,
of
the
anticompetitive
rule
to
demonstrate
at
least
some
justification,
at
least
some
need
for
it.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
that
is
our
position
and
that
was
the
position
taken
by
the
commission.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
as
this
court
noted
in
the
carnation
--
pacific
west
bound
conference
case,
the
congress,
which
enacted
the
shipping
act,
was
not
hostile
to
antitrust
regulation.
that
congress
concluded
that
the
conference
system
had
produced
substantial
evils
and
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
continue
without
governmental
supervision.
the
house
committee
on
merchant
marine
matters
the
seller
report,
enjoined
upon
the
maritime
commission
the
duty
to
apply
strict
administrative
surveillance.
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
if
not
reversed,
can
have
no
other
effect
than
to
prevent
governmental
supervision.
for
all
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
government,
and
for
all
of
the
reasons
advanced
by
government
counsel
here
today
as
well
as
those
we
have
put
forward,
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
be
reinstated
and
re-affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
question
posed
by
chief
justice,
whether
the
respondents
have
an
opportunity
to
come
forward
and
justify
their
rules
in
the
hearings
below,
let
me
state
unequivocally,
there
was
no
surprise.
they
were
put
on
notice
at
the
outset
of
what
the
issues
were,
they
were
well
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
court
in
--
his
branson
case
cited
at
page
9
of
our
brief
in
which
the
dc
circuit
1954
had
said
that,
“actions
which
invade
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws
more
than
our
necessary
should
not
be
approved
under
the
shipping
act.
they
were
aware
of
it
because
hearing
counsel
had
adopted
a
standard
early
in
the
case
that
called
for
justification.
they
attempted
to
prove,
need
or
justification
that
put
in
evidence
in
an
effort
to
support
each
of
the
arguments
which
mr.
neaher
has
made
here
to
your
honors,
this
morning.
they
tried
and
they
failed
to
convince
the
maritime
commission,
the
body
whose
expertise
it
is
--
in
whose
expertise
congress
has
assigned
the
task
of
making
the
judgment.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
as
one
of,
your
honor
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
the
commission
was
willing
to
take
evidence,
if
any
of
the
parties
wished
to
take
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
well,
these
respondents
are
very
knowledgeable,
your
honor.
and
all
--
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
commission
never
said
anything
contrary
to
that
but
the
commission
certainly
gave
opportunity
to
the
parties
to
make
an
application
to
take
more
evidence
if
the
parties
wanted
it.
nobody
made
such
an
application.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
no
one
has
suggested
it,
your
honor,
because
it
really
isn’t
necessary.
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record.
even
the
examiners,
i
pointed
out,
is
not
in
disagreement
with
the
commission.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
respondents
have
never
asked.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
they
have
never
asked.
indeed,
they
put
in
their
evidence
that
put
in
everything
they
had
and
when
they
failed
with
the
maritime
commission
for
the
first
time,
when
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
they
suggested
they
had
no
burden,
no
need
to
put
in
evidence
on
this.
that
was
a
switch
in
their
position.
it’s
an
extraordinary
concept.
if
it
is
accepted
by
the
courts,
it
will
make
regulation
by
the
maritime
commission
absolutely
impossible
in
our
view.
now,
we
do
want
to
point
out
that
not
all
the
anticompetitive
acts
of
respondents
have
been
prohibited
by
the
commission.
the
commission
was
very
selective
indeed.
it
picked
the
extreme
anticompetitive
measures.
in
the
case
of
the
unanimity
rule,
it’s
a
rule
which
goes
far
beyond
just
an
ordinary
price
fixing
but
requires
price
fixing
by
100%
of
the
25
members
so
that
the
price
freeze
stays
in
effect
forever
until
they
can
get
a
100%
to
change
it.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
prohibit
that,
not
to
prohibit
collective
action.
they
can
still
take
a
collective
action
so
that
there
will
be
no
rate
war,
commission
war
among
the
lines.
they
just
are
required
to
take
that
collective
action
by
a
somewhat
more
flexible
voting
rule.
mr.
neaher’s
statutory
construction
is
not
borne
out
by
the
status
itself
which
reads,
“before
approval,
all
agreements
shall
be
unlawful”.
it’s
only
after
they
were
approved
that
they
obtain
an
antitrust
exemption
and
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
the
standards
applied
by
the
maritime
commission
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
here
refers
to
has
to
do
with
the
dual
rate
legislation
which
was
totally
different
from
what’s
involved
here.
as
we
read
that
legislation,
and
it
did
require
affirmative
legislation,
we
might
point
out
in
order
to
obtain
such
approval.
that
legislation
never
impaired
the
concepts
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
original
federal
maritime
board’s
branson
case,
which
came
before
this
court.
it
merely
imposed
a
right
to
have
dual
rate
contracts
under
very
limited
safeguards.
the
international
argument
has
been
dealt
with
in
our
reply
brief,
the
appeal
to
chauvinism,
the
arguments
that
we
would
be
interfering
with
international
comity,
these
lines
are
being
affected
only
insofar
as
their
actions
apply
to
agents
in
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
the
universal?
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
we
believe
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
re-evaluate
the
record.
this
is
not
a
question
of
evidence
in
this
case
but
is
a
question
of
choice
of
remedies.
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
elect
the
remedy
and
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
and
rather
than
apply
the
doctrine
of
that
universal
camera
case,
we
suggest
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
consolo
against
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
the
controlling
standard.
however,
if
this
court
is
interested
in
the
evidence,
it
is
summarized
in
our
brief
at
great
length
at
pages
37
to
49
where
we
detailed
the
evidence
which
supports
the
findings
of
the
commission.
we
do
point
out,
for
example,
that
the
examiner
in
his
opinion
at
page
421
of
the
record
said
that
unanimity
rule
had
blocked
action
by
the
sub-committee.
that
the
sub-committee
of
the
atlantic
conference
was
the
committee
that
initiated
the
action
and
that
he
did
find
that
the
record
in
this
proceeding
at
page
431
establishes
the
fact
that
water
carrier
bookings
have
been
retarded
to
a
degree
and
air
carrier
bookings
increase
because
agents
have
diverted
traffic.
and
even
the
dissents
at
page
572
of
the
record
says,
“there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind”
--
this
is
the
commission
dissent
of
commissioner
paterson
–
“there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind”,
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
572,
“that
the
unanimity
and
tying
rules
have
prevented
changes
and
have
prevented
certain
ticket
selling
services.
in
answer
to
the
question
of
substantial
evidence,
we
refer
your
honors,
in
addition
to
those
pages
to
our
brief
at
page
14
through
16
where
we
cite
the
new
findings
of
the
commission.
and,
finally,
we
respectfully
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
words
that
mr.
justice
black
in
the
first
chenery
case
at
318
u.s.
99
where
he
said,
“a
judicial
requirement
of
circumstantially
detailed
findings
as
the
price
of
court
approval
can
bog
the
administrative
power
in
a
quagmire
of
minutiae”
hyper
critical
exactions
as
to
findings
can
provide
a
handy
but
an
almost
invisible
glide
way,
enabling
courts
to
pass
from
a
narrow
confines
of
law
into
a
more
spacious
domain
of
policy.
we
submit
that
that
is
what
happened
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
that
it
chose
to
make
policy
instead
of
leaving
back
to
the
federal
maritime
commission,
the
body
entrusted
with
that
task
by
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.

258,
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
concurs
in
the
views
expressed
by
the
united
states
government
and
at
this
time,
we
would
like
to
add
some
additional
points
and
answer
some
of
the
questions
which
your
honors
have
raised.
in
the
light
of
the
prospective
we
have
acquired
after
a
living
with
this
case
for
more
than
ten
years.
first,
let
me
identify
as
to
the
american
society
of
travel
agents,
it
is
the
principle
of
the
trade
association
of
independent
travel
agents
in
the
united
states
and
for
anyone
who
has
been
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
the
opportunity
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
agents
but
we
say
that
there
are
people
who
sell
and
promote
travel
of
all
kinds,
ocean,
rail,
air
and
bus,
they
create
and
sell
tours;
they
get
no
payment
generally
by
the
public
but
rely
for
their
livelihood
on
commissions
paid
by
the
carriers
and
by
hotels.
according
to
the
survey
made
by
the
government
in
this
case,
in
exhibit
“40”,
they
are
generally
small
businessman.
they
are
individual
entrepreneurs.
they
are
not
employees
although
the
lines,
the
respondents
here,
regard
them
as
their
principal
sales
force.
they
are
nevertheless
forbidden
by
the
national
labor
laws
to
combine
to
act
collectively.
they
are
also
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws
to
act
collectively.
we
did
bring
this
complaint
as
mr.
seibel
has
stated.
in
1958,
very
reluctantly
before
the
federal
maritime
board
--
reluctantly
because
the
agents
have
long
had
great
loyalty
to
these
lines
--
they
were
agents
for
these
lines
long
before
the
wright
brothers
began
to
experiment
with
air
flight.
nevertheless,
after
having
heard
for
many
years
the
old
story
that
they
have
rules
which
dated
back
to
1879
and
rules
which
prevented
any
change
in
their
formed
act
because
they
couldn’t
unanimity,
and
after
making
every
effort
to
persuade
the
lines,
to
change
their
rules
and
having
failed
and
in
post
war
period
when
the
competition
of
airlines
began
to
prove,
that
these
carriers
were
heading
for
disaster
and
were
too
inflexible
to
change
to
adopt
to
the
changing
economic
conditions
asked
about
its
complaint
before
the
then
federal
maritime
board,
which
led
to
this
investigation
in
1959.
and
as
mr.
seibel
stated,
it
was
the
first
investigation
of
how
these
respondents
collectively
treat
travel
agents
and
it
was
comprehensive.
it
led
to
a
three-week
hearing
in
new
york
city
in
1961
to
a
report
by
the
examiner
in
1963
to
a
first
commission
order
in
1964,
a
first
court
of
appeals
remand
in
1965,
a
second
commission
order
where
we
again
had
to
a
brief
and
argue
the
entire
case
and
this
time
before
a
new
member
of
the
commission
and
convince
him
to
join
with
the
majority
and,
finally,
to
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1967.
now,
the
principal
argument
advanced
by
the
respondents
here
in
their
brief
is
that
there
just
isn’t
enough
evidence
to
sustain
what
the
commission
did
and
this
is
getting
to
the
point
which
mr.
justice
fortas
has
raised.
well
as
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
respondents
are
seeking
to
apply
here
a
very
rigid
evidentiary
standard,
one
which
may
be
applicable
to
a
situation
in
which
an
agency
acts
in
a
quasi-judicial
function
but
which
has
no
application
to
an
agency
in
its
regulatory
function.
in
addition
to
the
american
airline
c.a.b.
case,
in
the
court
below
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
which
the
distinction
between
the
forms
of
agency
action
is
very
clearly
spelled
out,
we
note
that
this
court
has
spelled
out
its
views
on
the
subject
of
regulatory
action
by
agencies.
in
the
case
of
the
federal
communications
commission
against
pottsville
broadcasting
at
309
u.s.
134
in
which
it
was
held
that
it
was
improper
for
an
appellate
court
to
apply
trial
court
standards
to
agency
regulatory
action.
and
again
in
mcclean
trucking
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
25,
this
court
has
held
that
it
was
proper
for
an
agency
to
speculate
as
to
future
consequences
and
effects
that
it
should
make
its
judgment
based
on
available
present
facts
and
on
its
past
experience.
well,
the
available
present
fact
here
were
we
submit
sufficient
despite
a
deliberate
policy
by
respondents
as
found
by
everybody
who
has
issued
findings
with
respect
to
this
case,
a
deliberate
policy
on
their
part
to
avoid
governmental
review,
adapted
and
adopted
out
of
fear
of
the
american
antitrust
laws.
that
was
an
uncontested
finding.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
earlier
to
mr.
seibel
with
respect
to
the
taking
of
additional
evidence;
and
this
also
bears
on
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
believe
that
no
additional
evidence
was
needed
and
nobody
ever
asked
for
it
because
primarily
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
agency
even
between
the
examiner
and
the
commission
as
to
the
underlying
evidentiary
facts.
the
examiner
found
that
unanimity
rule
had
blocked
changes
in
commissions
and
he
found
that
there
had
been
detriment
to
the
lines.
where
he
different
from
the
commission
was
solely
with
respect
to
the
remedy.
he
thought
the
remedy
for
this
diversion
by
the
agents
was
to
pass
a
rule
prohibiting
diversion.
we
could
call
this
a
prohibition
law
and
it
would
probably
have
had
about
as
much
a
success
as
our
national
prohibition
law.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
well,
the
court
was
wrong,
your
honor,
in
our
view
because
it
was
applying
a
standard
of
review
which
this
court
has
subsequently
held
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
no,
the
court
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency
with
respect
to
the
remedy.
the
court
said,
we
find
the
reasoning
of
the
examiner
more
persuasive
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
the
examiner
having
suggested
that
the
remedy
to
be
applied
was
to
pass
a
rule.
but
this
was
one
of
the
court’s
principal
objections
to
the
commission’s
report
and
i
point
out
to
your
honors,
that
the
opinion
written
by
the
court
below
was
written
by
judge
george
washington,
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
consolo
against
the
federal
maritime
commission
which
this
court
reversed
for
applying
an
incorrect
standard
of
review.
consolo
was
reversed
by
this
court
one
year
after
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
so
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
issues
before
it,
it
was
applying
the
wrong
administrative
standard
of
review.
now,
with
respect
to
your
honors’
question
as
to
what
findings
there
were,
all
of
the
people
who
have
heard
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
examiner
and
the
commission
found
that
the
unanimity
rule
have
blocked
changes
in
commissions,
found
that
agents
were
diverting
travelers
to
the
airlines.
the
sole
issue
was
what
to
do
about
it.
the
examiner
thought
you
prohibited.
the
commission
thought
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
is
to
let
the
lines
be
free
to
exercise
their
business
judgment,
unfettered
by
the
veto
power
of
the
unanimity
rule.
in
addition,
the
examiner
had
another
remedy.
he
thought
that
you
could
disqualify
the
seven
lines
who
do
not
serve
united
states
ports
from
voting,
disenfranchise
them
completely.
the
commission’s
remedy
was
to
let
them
have
a
vote
but
do
away
with
their
veto
power.
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
really
quarrel
with
the
evidence.
it
said,
“we
find
the
reasoning
of
the
examiner
as
to
the
remedy
more
persuasive.
this
was
a
substitution
of
the
court’s
judgment
for
that
of
a
commission.
and
we
make
this
point
historically
because
when
it
finally
went
from
the
court
of
appeals
back
to
commission,
who
wrote
a
very
extensive
and
very
learned
opinion,
the
second
time
around,
detailing
all
of
the
points
on
which
it
relied
and
it
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
might
say
that
respondents
elected
to
bring
the
case
even
though
they
are
located
in
new
york
and
even
though
the
case
was
tried
in
new
york
before
hearing
examined
there
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
they
had
their
choice
of
courts.
they
elected
to
bring
it
before
the
court
of
appeals
presumably
because
it
was
applying
a
pre-consolo
standard
of
review
and
they
thought
they
had
their
best
chance
to
success
there
and
one
can’t
quarrel
with
an
advocate
for
doing
that
but
it
was
the
wrong
standard
of
review.
as
i
said,
the
court
below
incorporated
in
its
brief
opinion,
in
the
case
which
is
before
your
honors
today.
its
earlier
opinion
saying
that
the
doubts
and
problems
they’ve
pointed
out
in
their
earlier
opinion
prevent
them
from
affirming
the
court
below.
but
as
i’ve
indicated,
since
that
opinion
was
based
on
a
pre
consolo
test,
it
was
error.
and,
moreover,
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
reject
the
application
of
antitrust
principles.
the
proposition
that
antitrust
principle
should
not
be
considered
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
lies
in
the
face
of
a
line
of
cases
in
this
court
beginning
with
mcclean
trucking
and
running
down
through
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
as
recently
as
denver
and
real
gram
western
railroad.
the
tenor
of
those
cases
is
that
regulatory
agencies
must
evaluate
collective
action
and
must
weigh
anticompetitive
considerations
and
try
to
reconcile
the
competing
statutory
schemes.
and
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
at
page
364,
this
court
held
that
the
exchange
would
be
violating
the
antitrust
laws
“unless
justified”
by
reference
to
the
securities
and
exchange
laws.
so
the
principle
to
call
upon
a
proponent
of
an
anticompetitive
rule
for
justification
has
been
accepted
by
this
court.
now
we
submit
that
the
maritime
commission
applied
no
per
se
rule
or
test.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
respondent
simply
failed
to
produce
any
evidence
of
need
or
any
other
justification
whatsoever.
we
need
not,
i
believe,
belabor
the
importance
of
this
principle
to
the
regulation
by
government
agencies
generally
in
dealing
with
antitrust
exemptions.
in
our
view,
there
can
be
no
practical
way
to
administer
the
shipping
act
or
any
other
regulatory
act
if
the
agency
cannot
require
the
proponent
of
the
rule,
of
the
anticompetitive
rule
to
demonstrate
at
least
some
justification,
at
least
some
need
for
it.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
that
is
our
position
and
that
was
the
position
taken
by
the
commission.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
as
this
court
noted
in
the
carnation
--
pacific
west
bound
conference
case,
the
congress,
which
enacted
the
shipping
act,
was
not
hostile
to
antitrust
regulation.
that
congress
concluded
that
the
conference
system
had
produced
substantial
evils
and
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
continue
without
governmental
supervision.
the
house
committee
on
merchant
marine
matters
the
seller
report,
enjoined
upon
the
maritime
commission
the
duty
to
apply
strict
administrative
surveillance.
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
if
not
reversed,
can
have
no
other
effect
than
to
prevent
governmental
supervision.
for
all
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
government,
and
for
all
of
the
reasons
advanced
by
government
counsel
here
today
as
well
as
those
we
have
put
forward,
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
be
reinstated
and
re-affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
question
posed
by
chief
justice,
whether
the
respondents
have
an
opportunity
to
come
forward
and
justify
their
rules
in
the
hearings
below,
let
me
state
unequivocally,
there
was
no
surprise.
they
were
put
on
notice
at
the
outset
of
what
the
issues
were,
they
were
well
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
court
in
--
his
branson
case
cited
at
page
9
of
our
brief
in
which
the
dc
circuit
1954
had
said
that,
“actions
which
invade
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws
more
than
our
necessary
should
not
be
approved
under
the
shipping
act.
they
were
aware
of
it
because
hearing
counsel
had
adopted
a
standard
early
in
the
case
that
called
for
justification.
they
attempted
to
prove,
need
or
justification
that
put
in
evidence
in
an
effort
to
support
each
of
the
arguments
which
mr.
neaher
has
made
here
to
your
honors,
this
morning.
they
tried
and
they
failed
to
convince
the
maritime
commission,
the
body
whose
expertise
it
is
--
in
whose
expertise
congress
has
assigned
the
task
of
making
the
judgment.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
as
one
of,
your
honor
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
the
commission
was
willing
to
take
evidence,
if
any
of
the
parties
wished
to
take
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
well,
these
respondents
are
very
knowledgeable,
your
honor.
and
all
--
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
commission
never
said
anything
contrary
to
that
but
the
commission
certainly
gave
opportunity
to
the
parties
to
make
an
application
to
take
more
evidence
if
the
parties
wanted
it.
nobody
made
such
an
application.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
no
one
has
suggested
it,
your
honor,
because
it
really
isn’t
necessary.
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record.
even
the
examiners,
i
pointed
out,
is
not
in
disagreement
with
the
commission.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
respondents
have
never
asked.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
they
have
never
asked.
indeed,
they
put
in
their
evidence
that
put
in
everything
they
had
and
when
they
failed
with
the
maritime
commission
for
the
first
time,
when
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
they
suggested
they
had
no
burden,
no
need
to
put
in
evidence
on
this.
that
was
a
switch
in
their
position.
it’s
an
extraordinary
concept.
if
it
is
accepted
by
the
courts,
it
will
make
regulation
by
the
maritime
commission
absolutely
impossible
in
our
view.
now,
we
do
want
to
point
out
that
not
all
the
anticompetitive
acts
of
respondents
have
been
prohibited
by
the
commission.
the
commission
was
very
selective
indeed.
it
picked
the
extreme
anticompetitive
measures.
in
the
case
of
the
unanimity
rule,
it’s
a
rule
which
goes
far
beyond
just
an
ordinary
price
fixing
but
requires
price
fixing
by
100%
of
the
25
members
so
that
the
price
freeze
stays
in
effect
forever
until
they
can
get
a
100%
to
change
it.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
prohibit
that,
not
to
prohibit
collective
action.
they
can
still
take
a
collective
action
so
that
there
will
be
no
rate
war,
commission
war
among
the
lines.
they
just
are
required
to
take
that
collective
action
by
a
somewhat
more
flexible
voting
rule.
mr.
neaher’s
statutory
construction
is
not
borne
out
by
the
status
itself
which
reads,
“before
approval,
all
agreements
shall
be
unlawful”.
it’s
only
after
they
were
approved
that
they
obtain
an
antitrust
exemption
and
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
the
standards
applied
by
the
maritime
commission
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
here
refers
to
has
to
do
with
the
dual
rate
legislation
which
was
totally
different
from
what’s
involved
here.
as
we
read
that
legislation,
and
it
did
require
affirmative
legislation,
we
might
point
out
in
order
to
obtain
such
approval.
that
legislation
never
impaired
the
concepts
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
original
federal
maritime
board’s
branson
case,
which
came
before
this
court.
it
merely
imposed
a
right
to
have
dual
rate
contracts
under
very
limited
safeguards.
the
international
argument
has
been
dealt
with
in
our
reply
brief,
the
appeal
to
chauvinism,
the
arguments
that
we
would
be
interfering
with
international
comity,
these
lines
are
being
affected
only
insofar
as
their
actions
apply
to
agents
in
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
the
universal?
mr.
robert
j.
sisk
we
believe
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
re-evaluate
the
record.
this
is
not
a
question
of
evidence
in
this
case
but
is
a
question
of
choice
of
remedies.
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
elect
the
remedy
and
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
and
rather
than
apply
the
doctrine
of
that
universal
camera
case,
we
suggest
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
consolo
against
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
the
controlling
standard.
however,
if
this
court
is
interested
in
the
evidence,
it
is
summarized
in
our
brief
at
great
length
at
pages
37
to
49
where
we
detailed
the
evidence
which
supports
the
findings
of
the
commission.
we
do
point
out,
for
example,
that
the
examiner
in
his
opinion
at
page
421
of
the
record
said
that
unanimity
rule
had
blocked
action
by
the
sub-committee.
that
the
sub-committee
of
the
atlantic
conference
was
the
committee
that
initiated
the
action
and
that
he
did
find
that
the
record
in
this
proceeding
at
page
431
establishes
the
fact
that
water
carrier
bookings
have
been
retarded
to
a
degree
and
air
carrier
bookings
increase
because
agents
have
diverted
traffic.
and
even
the
dissents
at
page
572
of
the
record
says,
“there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind”
--
this
is
the
commission
dissent
of
commissioner
paterson
–
“there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind”,
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
572,
“that
the
unanimity
and
tying
rules
have
prevented
changes
and
have
prevented
certain
ticket
selling
services.
in
answer
to
the
question
of
substantial
evidence,
we
refer
your
honors,
in
addition
to
those
pages
to
our
brief
at
page
14
through
16
where
we
cite
the
new
findings
of
the
commission.
and,
finally,
we
respectfully
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
words
that
mr.
justice
black
in
the
first
chenery
case
at
318
u.s.
99
where
he
said,
“a
judicial
requirement
of
circumstantially
detailed
findings
as
the
price
of
court
approval
can
bog
the
administrative
power
in
a
quagmire
of
minutiae”
hyper
critical
exactions
as
to
findings
can
provide
a
handy
but
an
almost
invisible
glide
way,
enabling
courts
to
pass
from
a
narrow
confines
of
law
into
a
more
spacious
domain
of
policy.
we
submit
that
that
is
what
happened
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
that
it
chose
to
make
policy
instead
of
leaving
back
to
the
federal
maritime
commission,
the
body
entrusted
with
that
task
by
congress.
thank
you.
