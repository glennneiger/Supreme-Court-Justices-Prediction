which
were
those
two
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
united
states
against
blackfeather
and
mille?
justice
potter
stewart
thousand
lakes?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally
whole
you
are
on
that
i
notice
really
before
you
--
in
the
conclusion
of
your
brief
you
ask
for
interest
at
the
rate
of
6%
from
june
1857
through
1860
and
the
5%
from
1860
to
1934
and
thereafter
such
rate
of
interest
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
well
i
really
have
two
questions.
what
is
the
basis
for
that
specific
prayer
and
secondly
have
you
figured
out
how
much
money
that
would
be?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
doubles
it
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
simple
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
therefore
be
something
more
than
$1
million?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
you
might
have
figured
out
--[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
quite
understand
the
--
you
gave
the
answer
to
my
second
question,
why
the
differing
rates
here?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
claims
commission
expressly
deal
with
this?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
where
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
all
dealing
with
this?
justice
potter
stewart
stating
the
general
rule
that
you
began
with
that
doesn't
have
very
much
to
do
with
this
case
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
potter
stewart
interest
doesn't
run
on
a
judgment
against
the
government,
everybody
believes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
interest
needed
to
be
annually
paid
to
the
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
this
article
7
says
the
interest
to
be
annually
paid
to
them,
the
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
have
this
case
that
justice
brown's
opinion
in
this
case
before
me,
it
wasn't
all
that
clear.
you
correctly
fore
stated
it
but
it
was
to
do
so
doing
the
pleasure
of
congress
and
the
actual
money
was
paid
over
in
1852
and
they
gave
them
interest
till
what
1884.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
this
case
would
cause
you
considerable
trouble?
justice
potter
stewart
during
the
pleasure
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
not
as
a
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
something
on
[inaudible]
i
guess
that's
not
the
correct
word,
but
it
is
hardly
an
absolute
right
to
receive
5%
that
the
chief's
had,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
and
yet
the
court
said
nonetheless
it
was
a
right?
