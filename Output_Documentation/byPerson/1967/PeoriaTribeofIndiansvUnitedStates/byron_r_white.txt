justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
see
how
you
understand
the
government's
argument.
if
the
contract
or
if
the
treaty
had
only
said
we
will
sell
the
lands
and
pay
over
to
you
the
proceeds,
that's
all
they'll
say.
now
would
you
say
that
the
government
denies
that
the
ability
--
it's
obligation
for
interest
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
government
could
promise
to
pay
over
and
then
not
pay
over
and
be
liable
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
be
liable
only
for
the
principal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
--
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
take
that
position
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no
--
let
me
get
to
the
other
part.
what
if
the
contract
or
the
treaty
just
said
that
government
promised
to
sell
the
lands
and
to
invest
the
proceeds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
includes
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
government
concedes
that
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
that
if
the
money
was
paid
out
it
was
to
be
invested?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
your
brief
concede
that,
you
had
pay
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
this
case
a
promise
by
the
united
states
to
invest
this
money.
it
wasn't
paid
out,
we
know
it
wasn't
paid
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
it
wasn't
paid
out
it
supposed
to
be
invested.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
so
we
should
take
this
case
as
though
the
united
states
promised
to
invest
a
$172,000
that
they
didn't
invest?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
the
person
paid
out,
therefore
it
should
have
been
invested.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
the
point
is
against
you
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
should
have
handed
$172,000
to
invest,
but
it
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
didn't
invest
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
breach
of
its
promise.
justice
byron
r.
white
$172,000
more
which
it
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
then
it
would
been
error
of
indian
claims
commission
to
have
said
that
in
order
to
do
equity
to
the
indians
under
our
statutory
authority,
in
order
to
do
that
we
will
pay
interest
on
this
claim
you
said
that
would
be
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
had
already
said
that
the
indian
claims
commission
may
grant
equitable
compensation,
to
that
extent
it
has
authorized
it
to
do
equity
as
the
chief
justice
suggests?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
united
states
wouldn't
have
been
liable
to
pay
interest
if
it
had
actually
gotten
the
money
invested
and
hadn't
received
any
return
on
it
then
if
the
indians
have
sued
perhaps
united
states
would
say,
well
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
invest,
but
isn't
it
something
else
again
when
they
didn't
even
invest
the
money?
didn't
have
it
to
invest
when
they
should
had
it
to
invest
and
the
indian
never
have
a
chance
to
earn
any
interest
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
this
act
sovereign
immunity
would
protect
the
government
from
any
action
for
the
value
of
the
blacksmith's
shop,
except
for
this
act
the
indians
couldn't
sue
for
this
$1,72,000,
could
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
depends
on
what
you
think
the
extent
the
waiver
was
in
term
of
using
equitable
and
that
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
sovereign
immunity
though,
a
contract
like
this
would
normally
result
in
type
litigation
and
the
recovery
of
interest.
