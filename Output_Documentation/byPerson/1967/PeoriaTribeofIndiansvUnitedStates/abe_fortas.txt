justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
correctly
remember
that
the
other
two
cases
involved
an
obligation
by
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
case
does
not
involve
an
obligation
by
the
united
states
to
pay
interest,
but
it
does
involve
by
your
argument
an
obligation
on
the
united
states
either
to
pay
up
money
to
the
indians
or
alternatively
to
invest
in
income
producing
stocks
or
bonds,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
now
let
me
ask
you
one
further
question.
if
there
were
nothing
here
except
a
breach
of
trust
by
the
united
states
in
its
failure
to
sell
the
lands
properly
so
as
to
realize
the
full
amount
that
it
should
have
realized
on
those
lands,
if
that's
all
we
had,
you
would
not
argue
that
the
indians
were
entitled
to
interest,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
solely
based
upon
on
the
language
to
which
i
referred
mainly
that
the
united
states
must
either
forthwith
payout
the
money
to
the
indians
or
must
invest
the
money,
which
you
say
is
equivalent
to
an
obligation
on
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
justice
abe
fortas
only
in
blackfeather
though
isn't
it,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
express
agreement
for
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
your
problem
here
on
the
brief
is
what
i
think
you
said
a
little
while
ago
you
got
to
persuade
this
court
that
we
have
to
reach
a
conclusion,
that
this
provision
that
you
rely
on
amounts
to
a
covenant
by
the
united
states
to
pay
interest
and
i
take
it
that
you
agree
that
the
mere
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
will
not
result
in
an
obligation
or
on
part
of
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that,
they
make
new
law,
it's
contrary
to
indian
heart
to
pay,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now
that's
different
matter.
that's
what
i
thought
you
are
on
–
your
argument
that
it
is,
but
if
there's
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
by
the
united
states
towards
the
indians
and
no
contract
provision
requiring
the
payment
of
interest,
then
there's
no
liability
on
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
various
indian
tribes
have
alleged
under
the
indian
claims
act
that
the
united
states
has
wrongfully
taken
their
land
and
haven't
there
been
awards
made
to
those
indian
tribes
some
of
them
very
large
amount,
relating
to
takings
back
in
the
19th
century,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
any
of
those
cases
has
interest
been
allowed?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
that's
not
the
kind
of
case
i
am
putting
here.
justice
abe
fortas
despite
the
fact
that
those
are
in
the
sense
of
the
way
cases
where
land
has
been
taken
from
the
indians
in
breach
of
sort
a
fiduciary
duty,
is
it
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
at
least
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
indian
cases
fifth
amendment
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
so
taking
case
from
that
i
put,
kind
of
case
that
i
put
to
you,
the
law
has
grown
up
so
that
the
indians
are
given
a
sum
of
money
under
this
act,
but
they
are
not
given
interest
dating
back
to
the
time
of
taking
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
at
least
something
resembling
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
that's
part
of
this
whole
what
i
may
refer
to
as
sort
of
a
package
deal
enacted
by
the
congress
to
--
in
an
attempt
to
alleviate
the
wrong
that's
been
done
to
the
indians
in
the
past,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
why,
as
i
understand
it
both
you
and
your
advisory
agree
that
in
this
case
if
there
is
nothing
that
you
can't
just
define
or
spell
out
the
specific
language
of
this
treaty,
an
obligation
to
pay
interest
there
is
no
obligation?
justice
abe
fortas
to
pay
interest.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
weren't
[inaudible]
there
is
of
course
is
a
default
in
duty
under
7
because
they
didn't
realize
the
proceeds
that
were
supposed
to
be
administered
under
and
in
accordance
with
article
7,
of
course
it
is
a
breach
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
correctly

that
the
other
two
cases
