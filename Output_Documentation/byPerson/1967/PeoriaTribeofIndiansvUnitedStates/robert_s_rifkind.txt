mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
our
starting
point
here
is
the
historic
and
unchallenged
rule
that
the
united
states
is
not
liable
for
interest
except
where
it
affirmatively
consents
to
such
liability
by
statute
or
treaty
or
contract.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
both
in
indian
cases
and
in
non-indian
cases
that
no
court
has
power
to
award
interest
against
the
united
states
in
the
absence
of
consent
given
in
clear
cut
and
unambiguous
terms.
now
the
only
exception
to
that
rule,
if
it
is
an
exception,
pertains
to
claims
for
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
taking
of
property,
which
can
itself
be
viewed
as
a
constitutional
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
any
event
petitioners
here
have
never
suggested
and
do
not
now
suggest
that
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
claim
that
they
are
asserting.
this
is
fundamentally
a
breach
of
contract
action.
the
critical
question
here
therefore
is
whether
article
7
of
the
treaty
of
1854
supplies
assent
to
the
imposition
of
interest
and
i
think
i'm
on
common
ground
with
the
petitioners
in
that
regard.
at
least
they
advised
the
court
below
whether
or
not
appellants
are
entitled
to
interest
depends
on
article
7.
conversely
they
have
never
suggested
and
they
do
not
suggest
today,
that
they
are
entitled
to
interest
by
virtue
of
anything
in
the
indian
claims
commission
act
and
any
suggestion
to
that
effect
would
be
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
decisions
to
the
court
of
claims
and
the
commission
itself.
accordingly
if
the
requisite
authority
for
an
award
of
interest
is
to
be
found
at
all,
it
must
be
found
in
the
language
of
article
7
and
the
critical
provision
which
has
already
been
read
to
you,
but
i'd
like
to
read
again,
says
simply
this.
“it
is
agreed
that
the
president
may
from
to
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
said
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
said
sales,
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks,
the
interest
to
be
annually
paid
to
them.”
now
the
indian
claims
commission
studied
that
language
carefully
and
could
not
find
that
it
constituted
an
undertaking,
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
it
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
page
66,
we
find
that
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
interest
on
any
award
in
this
case.
the
rule
is
well
established
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
the
last
judgment
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
they
say
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
no
contract
or
statutory
requirement
for
the
payment
of
interest
in
this
case
and
i
take
it
that,
that
can
only
be
a
construction
of
section
7
because
that
is
the
context
it
was
asserted,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
commission
didn't
address
itself
to
that
as
far
as
i
can
recall.
i
think
the
court
of
claims
assumed
that
the
president
didn't
have
the
right
to
do
nothing
with
the
money,
and
he
had
to
exercise
the
discretion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
right.
i
think
that's
right.
but
it
is
our
submission
that
the
language
that
i've
just
read
from
article
7,
no
matter
what
cannon
of
construction
could
be
applied
and
no
matter
how
liberally
it
might
be
construed
that,
that
language
does
not
constitute
an
undertaking
to
pay
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
general
principle
that
we've
discussed,
that
the
congress
must
assent.
it
doesn't
--
that
language
is
not
we
submit
undertaking
by
the
united
states
to
obligate
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
for
instance.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
it
was
never
received.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
first
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
of
course
article
7
of
the
treaty
says
that
the
proceeds
shall
be
invested
or
paid
out.
now
we
are
not
talking
about
--
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
although
i
don't
think
it's
dispositive
that
we
are
not
talking
about
money
that
came
into
the
treasury.
i
mean
some
one
ran
off
with
it.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
should
have
been
received.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
obviously
didn't
invest
what
it
had
to
invest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
sale
was
in
breach
of
its
promise.
we
maintain
that
it
complied
to
the
letter
with
article
7
that
is
what
it
had,
it
invested.
there
is
no
dispute
however
that
it
should
have
raised
more
money
than
it
did.
we
haven't
an
appeal
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
but
the
critical
point
we
think
is
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
a
promise
to
invest
money
for
someone
and
a
promise
to
pay
interest
to
someone.
it's
the
different
between
being
a
debtor
and
being
an
agent.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
in
the
context
to
that
language
it
means
the
interest
received
from
the
investment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
could
a
lot
of
money,
it
could
be
a
little
money,
it's
not
a
bond
of
the
treasury.
it
says
what
we
receive
after
investing
it
for
you,
we'll
pay
over
to
you.
it's
an
undertaking
to
manage
a
portfolio;
it's
what
any
mutual
fund
would
do
for
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
the
sort
of
undertaking.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
the
sort
of
undertaking
that
i
think
merrill
lynch
or
some
investment
broker
would
undertake.
we
will
take
your
money
and
we'll
invest
it.
we
don't
tell
you
how
much
you
are
going
to
earn
on
it.
what
we
do
earn
on
it
we'll
pay
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
equitable
that
we
should
pay
them
back
the
$172,000
for
land
that
was
taken.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i
can
answer
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
is
the
problem
in
every
case
that
involves
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
the
right
to
decide
how
far
it's
going
to
go
until
1946
when
it
put
in
covenant
in
tort
claims?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
i
think
that
the
government
had
made
restoration
to
the
extent
that
it
has
bound
itself
to
provide
a
remedy.
that
is
that
congress
has
undertaken
to
remedy,
an
ancient
and
grievous
wrong.
it
has
not
undertaken
to
pay
for
its
delay
in
providing
that
remedy.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i
can
conclude
--
all
i
can
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
is
that,
if
what
you
are
suggesting
is
sound,
then
in
every
case
wherever
there
has
been
a
dereliction
by
the
government
on
a
contract
with
or
without
indian,
it's
obliged
to
pay
interest
during
the
delay
in
providing
a
remedy
and
congress
at
least
has
never
gone
that
far.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
would
assume
that
this
action
was
really
under
the
more
usual
provisions
of
the
indian
claims
commissions'
statue
which
provides
for
recovery
on
a
contract
or
treaty.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
about
equitable
has
ever
been
construed
by
this
court
to
embrace
an
allowance
of
interest
where
congress
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
as
to
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
but
there
are
substantial
number
of
cases
of
private
--
before
the
--
even
tucker
act
was
passed,
private
bills,
which
said
that
the
court
of
claim
shall
provide
equitable
relief
in
this
situation
and
this
court
in
number
of
cases
said
that
means
according
to
the
traditional
rules
of
law
fairly
construed,
but
it
has
never
been
thought
to
mean
an
assent
to
the
imposition
of
liability
for
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
can't
--
i
can't
distinguish
the
situation
in
which
the
united
states
says
we'll
invest
the
money
and
the
situation
in
which
the
united
states
says
we'll
build
you
a
blacksmith's
shop
with
the
proceeds,
that
will
be
a
value
to
you
or
we'll
build
you
a
school
house
with
the
money
that
will
be
of
use
to
you,
or
we'll
buy
you
fertilizer
for
your
farms
that
will
of
value
to
you.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
proceeds
would
have
been
a
value
to
the
indians
but
i
take
it,
maybe
i
am
wrong,
i
take
it
the
petitioners
concede
that
in
those
situations
they
would
not
now
be
entitled
to
the
value
that
the
blacksmith
shop
or
the
fertilizer
or
the
school
house
would
have
been
to
them
over
a
110
years.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
right
because
there
is
no
dispute
but
there
is
no
undertaking.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
but
this
act
while
remedying
the
principle
wrong
does
not
remedy
the
delay
that
it
took
congress
to
get
around
to
passing
the
act.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
at
least
i
take
it
that
the
petitioners
don't
suggest
that
the
claims
commission
act
provides
their
remedy.
the
position
is
there
has
be
that
article
7
provides
the
predecessor
for
their
remedy
and
that
article
7
is
a
obligation
on
the
treasury
to
pay
interest
and
we
see
it
as
different
than
undertaking
to
build
a
blacksmith's
shop.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely.
even
if
it
was
--
i
should
qualify
that
if
it
was
deemed
that
the
amount
was
sufficiently
determined
but
i
suppose
you
know
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i'd
suppose
you'd
have
a
statute
of
limitations
which
we
--
which
the
government
has
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
or
laches
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
except
for
the
two
cases
that
have
been
given
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
i
understand,
in
the
general
case
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
unless
the
claim
could
be
squeezed
into
the
fifth
amendment
interest
has
been
denied?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
were
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right
sir,
indeed
i
think
there
was
a
fairly
careful
appraisal
of
what
the
likely
costs
of
legislation
regarding
the
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
thank
you
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
that
the
past
cases
are
water
over
the
dam.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
involve
splitting
a
cause
of
action,
that's
just
the
breaks
in
civil
ligations
usually.
there
are
great
many
cases
of
course.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
i
suppose
the
special
legislation.
now
a
great
reliance
has
been
placed
by
the
petitioners
on
two
particular
cases
which
i
think
serve
to
dramatize
the
different
situation
we
have
now.
i
refer
to
both
blackfeather
and
the
mille
lac
case.
i
think
the
language
in
blackfeather
shows
what
a
real
obligation
to
pay
interest
is.
there
the
treaty
expressly
provided
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
the
chiefs
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
their
people
annually
5%
as
an
annuity.
now
whatever
the
words
as
an
annuity
may
have
meant
this
court
had
little
trouble
in
finding
that
that
treaty
contained
a
contract
expressly
stipulating
for
inference.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
something
like
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
there
--
i
don't
think
so,
the
critical
difference
is
that
there
everyone
knew
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into
that
the
treasury
was
going
to
pay
out
5%
per
annum.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
during
the
pleasure
of
course
everything
is
sir,
it
ends
up
that
way.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right,
i
suppose
there
is
a
condition
or
something
to
point
that
never
occurred.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
maybe
its
minimal
but
at
least
there
is
a
language
that
sounds
like
a
bond,
that
sounds
like
an
obligation
of
the
treasury.
even
more
so
in
mille
lac
which
they
--
which
petitioner's
cite.
there
all
money
accruing
from
the
disposal
of
said
land
shall
be
placed
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
the
credit
of
the
chippewa
indians
as
a
permanent
fund
which
shall
draw
interest
at
the
rate
of
5%
per
annum.
now
that
we
submit
is
the
sort
of
language
that
meets
the
test
or
it
meets
the
standard
of
an
express
consent
to
pay
interest.
article
7
contains
no
undertaking
that
anyway
resembles
that.
moreover
and
this
is
particularly
important
thing,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
language
of
the
peoria
treaty
is
not
some
accident
or
fluke
of
draftsmanship.
the
treaty
in
1854
followed
upon
reports
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
which
were
transmitted
to
congress
by
the
president
in
1852
and
1853
urging
the
discontinuance
of
the
practice
of
holding
indian
funds
in
the
treasury
and
appropriating
annual
interest
payments.
it
was
urged
that
the
investment
of
such
funds
in
marketable
securities
would
reduce
the
treasury's
surplus,
would
benefit
the
national
economy
and
most
important
would
relieve
the
government
from
the
payment
of
the
immense
sums
which
the
annual
interest
must
eventually
amount
to.
that
would
seem
to
make
it
very
clear
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
assume
a
liability
for
interest.
that
the
purpose
was
the
very
opposite
to
relieve
the
treasury
of
that
burden.
under
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
entirely
right
in
concluding
that
it
would
be
judicial
treaty
writing
to
read
into
that
agreement
an
express
promise
by
the
government
to
pay
interest
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
judicial
treaty
writing
is
what
petitioners
really
have
in
mind.
in
the
language
that
was
referred
to
earlier
they
asked
for
an
award
of
6%
from
1857
to
1860
and
5%
from
1860
to
1934
and
at
such
rate
as
this
court
deems
appropriate
thereafter.
now
its
perfectly
clear
that
article
7
nothing
about
5%.
it
says
nothing
about
6%
and
it
certainly
says
nothing
about
such
rate
as
this
court
deems
appropriate.
now
perhaps
by
way
of
confession
and
avoidance
petitioners
seek
to
escape
from
the
government's
immunity
to
liability
for
interest
by
urging
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
government
has
misrepresented
the
nature
of
their
claim.
they
do
not
they
say
seek
interest
on
a
claim
but
rather
damages
measured
by
interest
for
the
failure
to
invest
under
the
express
provisions
of
article
7.
now
this
distinction
between
interest
on
a
claim
and
damages
measured
by
interest
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
the
two
are
tweedledee
and
tweedledum.
their
brief
--
at
least
the
distinction
is
so
illusive
that
it
eluded
petitioners
until
now,
because
in
their
brief
in
the
court
of
claims
they
clearly
said
that
this
appeal
seeks
the
recovery
of
interest
on
an
award
of
damages
and
that
is
how
the
court
of
claims
understood
it
and
that's
how
the
indian
claims
commission
understood
it.
furthermore
i
think
it's
helpful
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
case
involves
the
breach
of
one
provision,
not
two
provisions
of
the
treaty.
unquestionably
the
land
was
not
sold
in
the
manner
provided
in
article
4.
but
there's
no
claim
or
at
least
there
wasn't
until
today,
that
the
united
states
was
guilty
of
any
default
under
article
7.
that
is
to
say
the
money
that
was
actually
received
from
the
sale
and
was
allocated
by
the
president
for
investment
was
in
fact
invested
and
the
income
was
scrupulously
applied
to
the
petitioner's
benefit.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
no
independent
misconduct
is
what
i'm
suggesting
under
section
7,
no
independent
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
mean
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
for
a
minute
that
these
indians
were
not
badly
treated,
they
were.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
analyzing
the
language
of
the
treaty
there
was
--
it's
not
a
point
worth
pressing.
there
was
not
an
independent
breach
under
article
7.
no
one
took
proceeds
which
he
did
not
pay
over
pay
over
to
the
indians
and
failed
to
invest
this.
no
one
ran
off
with
the
income
from
those
investments.
when
it
came
to
article
7
what
came
under
the
purview
of
article
7
was
properly
dealt
with.
now
more
should
have
come
in
i
agree.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
can't
--
i
don't
know
what
it
means
to
say
that
it's
a
misconduct
of
congress
not
to
have
passed
the
indian
claims.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
we
can
say
that
congress
ought
to
have
to
passed
this
act
a
long
time
ago,
but
i
don't
find
that
illuminating
as
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
land
had
long
since
been
sold.
the
land
was
sold
when
it
was
supposed
to
be
sold,
the
problem
was
the
price
at
which
it
was
sold.
the
president
of
course
had
a
very
difficult
problem
in
1857,
there
were
people
who
had
built
homes
on
this
land.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
i
suppose
that
the
critical
thing
is
that
congress
could
have
appropriated
the
money
that
was
the
difference
long
ago
and
it
didn't,
and
no
doubt
about
it.
all
i
meant
to
suggest
is
that
there
are
really
two
categories
of
injury
flowing
from
the
original
fair
and
it
was
grievance
fair,
no
doubt
about
it.
one
is
the
indians
didn't
have
the
full
value
of
their
land
in
1857
and
were
aggrieved
about
that.
the
judgment
has
been
entered
for
that
for
$172,000.
the
second
category
of
injury
and
it's
one
common
in
all
litigation
is
that
they
did
have
the
use
of
that
money
over
110
years.
now
is
the
sort
of
injury,
the
sort
of
damage
that
under
any
of
the
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
congress
has
generally
declined
to
provide
a
remedy
for
it.
it
has
generally
declined
to
pay
for
it's
own
delay
in
providing
a
remedy.
as
justice
holmes
said
in
a
non-indian
case
for
the
court,
boston
sand
&
gravel
v.
united
states
in
278
u.s.
congress
distinguishes
between
the
underlying
damages
and
the
later
loss
caused
by
delay
in
paying
for
the
first,
between
damages
and
the
allowance
of
interest
on
damages.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
that
was
rights
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
undertaken
to
pay
for
a
ship
that
it
has
destroyed.
he
said
congress
undertook
to
have
a
court
find
the
value
of
the
ship
that
was
destroyed,
but
the
fact
that
you
haven't
had
that
ship
for
the
last
decade
is
not
what
congress
undertook
to
pay
for.
i
also
think
it's
worth
noting
in
this
connection
very
briefly
that
petitioners
claim
for
damages
measured
by
interest
is
in
it's
nature
a
claim
that
accrues
over
time,
year-by-year,
yet
the
indian
claims
commission
act
expressly
provides
that
commission
shall
not
consider
any
claim
accruing
after
1946.
now
at
very
least
that
means,
i
suppose
that
the
commission
isn't
entitled
to
award
interest
for
the
last
20
odd
years,
an
amount
greater
than
the
underlying
claim
in
fact.
but
i
also
suggest
that
it
reflects
a
congressional
intention
or
expectation
that
generally
they
were
not
dealing
with
claims,
the
sort
of
interest
that
accrue
over
time.
petitioners
urge
finally
in
their
applied
brief
that
the
purpose
of
these
proceedings
is
to
put
the
indians
in
the
position
they
would
have
enjoyed
had
the
government
complied
with
the
treaty.
that
view
we
submit
would
require
the
payment
of
interest
in
every
case,
for
every
claim
against
the
united
states
is
based
on
some
dereliction
and
in
every
case
there
is
a
period
of
delay
before
payment
is
made,
during
which
some
value
is
denied.
we
submit
that
in
waiving
one
or
another
aspect
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
in
the
tucker
act
and
the
tort
claims
act
or
the
indian
claims
act,
congress
has
not
gone
that
far
and
we
urge
that
in
this
area
where
congress
has
slowly
but
progressively
liberalized
the
law,
where
congress
has
not
gone,
this
court
ought
not
follow.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
our
starting
point
here
is
the
historic
and
unchallenged
rule
that
the
united
states
is
not
liable
for
interest
except
where
it
affirmatively
consents
to
such
liability
by
statute
or
treaty
or
contract.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
both
in
indian
cases
and
in
non-indian
cases
that
no
court
has
power
to
award
interest
against
the
united
states
in
the
absence
of
consent
given
in
clear
cut
and
unambiguous
terms.
now
the
only
exception
to
that
rule,
if
it
is
an
exception,
pertains
to
claims
for
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
taking
of
property,
which
can
itself
be
viewed
as
a
constitutional
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
any
event
petitioners
here
have
never
suggested
and
do
not
now
suggest
that
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
claim
that
they
are
asserting.
this
is
fundamentally
a
breach
of
contract
action.
the
critical
question
here
therefore
is
whether
article
7
of
the
treaty
of
1854
supplies
assent
to
the
imposition
of
interest
and
i
think
i'm
on
common
ground
with
the
petitioners
in
that
regard.
at
least
they
advised
the
court
below
whether
or
not
appellants
are
entitled
to
interest
depends
on
article
7.
conversely
they
have
never
suggested
and
they
do
not
suggest
today,
that
they
are
entitled
to
interest
by
virtue
of
anything
in
the
indian
claims
commission
act
and
any
suggestion
to
that
effect
would
be
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
decisions
to
the
court
of
claims
and
the
commission
itself.
accordingly
if
the
requisite
authority
for
an
award
of
interest
is
to
be
found
at
all,
it
must
be
found
in
the
language
of
article
7
and
the
critical
provision
which
has
already
been
read
to
you,
but
i'd
like
to
read
again,
says
simply
this.
“it
is
agreed
that
the
president
may
from
to
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
said
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
said
sales,
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks,
the
interest
to
be
annually
paid
to
them.”
now
the
indian
claims
commission
studied
that
language
carefully
and
could
not
find
that
it
constituted
an
undertaking,
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
pay
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
it
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
page
66,
we
find
that
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
interest
on
any
award
in
this
case.
the
rule
is
well
established
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
the
last
judgment
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
they
say
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
no
contract
or
statutory
requirement
for
the
payment
of
interest
in
this
case
and
i
take
it
that,
that
can
only
be
a
construction
of
section
7
because
that
is
the
context
it
was
asserted,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
commission
didn't
address
itself
to
that
as
far
as
i
can
recall.
i
think
the
court
of
claims
assumed
that
the
president
didn't
have
the
right
to
do
nothing
with
the
money,
and
he
had
to
exercise
the
discretion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
right.
i
think
that's
right.
but
it
is
our
submission
that
the
language
that
i've
just
read
from
article
7,
no
matter
what
cannon
of
construction
could
be
applied
and
no
matter
how
liberally
it
might
be
construed
that,
that
language
does
not
constitute
an
undertaking
to
pay
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
general
principle
that
we've
discussed,
that
the
congress
must
assent.
it
doesn't
--
that
language
is
not
we
submit
undertaking
by
the
united
states
to
obligate
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
for
instance.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
it
was
never
received.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
first
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
of
course
article
7
of
the
treaty
says
that
the
proceeds
shall
be
invested
or
paid
out.
now
we
are
not
talking
about
--
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
although
i
don't
think
it's
dispositive
that
we
are
not
talking
about
money
that
came
into
the
treasury.
i
mean
some
one
ran
off
with
it.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
should
have
been
received.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
obviously
didn't
invest
what
it
had
to
invest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
sale
was
in
breach
of
its
promise.
we
maintain
that
it
complied
to
the
letter
with
article
7
that
is
what
it
had,
it
invested.
there
is
no
dispute
however
that
it
should
have
raised
more
money
than
it
did.
we
haven't
an
appeal
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
but
the
critical
point
we
think
is
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
a
promise
to
invest
money
for
someone
and
a
promise
to
pay
interest
to
someone.
it's
the
different
between
being
a
debtor
and
being
an
agent.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
in
the
context
to
that
language
it
means
the
interest
received
from
the
investment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
could
a
lot
of
money,
it
could
be
a
little
money,
it's
not
a
bond
of
the
treasury.
it
says
what
we
receive
after
investing
it
for
you,
we'll
pay
over
to
you.
it's
an
undertaking
to
manage
a
portfolio;
it's
what
any
mutual
fund
would
do
for
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
the
sort
of
undertaking.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
the
sort
of
undertaking
that
i
think
merrill
lynch
or
some
investment
broker
would
undertake.
we
will
take
your
money
and
we'll
invest
it.
we
don't
tell
you
how
much
you
are
going
to
earn
on
it.
what
we
do
earn
on
it
we'll
pay
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
equitable
that
we
should
pay
them
back
the
$172,000
for
land
that
was
taken.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i
can
answer
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
is
the
problem
in
every
case
that
involves
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
the
right
to
decide
how
far
it's
going
to
go
until
1946
when
it
put
in
covenant
in
tort
claims?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
i
think
that
the
government
had
made
restoration
to
the
extent
that
it
has
bound
itself
to
provide
a
remedy.
that
is
that
congress
has
undertaken
to
remedy,
an
ancient
and
grievous
wrong.
it
has
not
undertaken
to
pay
for
its
delay
in
providing
that
remedy.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i
can
conclude
--
all
i
can
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
is
that,
if
what
you
are
suggesting
is
sound,
then
in
every
case
wherever
there
has
been
a
dereliction
by
the
government
on
a
contract
with
or
without
indian,
it's
obliged
to
pay
interest
during
the
delay
in
providing
a
remedy
and
congress
at
least
has
never
gone
that
far.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
would
assume
that
this
action
was
really
under
the
more
usual
provisions
of
the
indian
claims
commissions'
statue
which
provides
for
recovery
on
a
contract
or
treaty.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
about
equitable
has
ever
been
construed
by
this
court
to
embrace
an
allowance
of
interest
where
congress
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
as
to
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
but
there
are
substantial
number
of
cases
of
private
--
before
the
--
even
tucker
act
was
passed,
private
bills,
which
said
that
the
court
of
claim
shall
provide
equitable
relief
in
this
situation
and
this
court
in
number
of
cases
said
that
means
according
to
the
traditional
rules
of
law
fairly
construed,
but
it
has
never
been
thought
to
mean
an
assent
to
the
imposition
of
liability
for
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
can't
--
i
can't
distinguish
the
situation
in
which
the
united
states
says
we'll
invest
the
money
and
the
situation
in
which
the
united
states
says
we'll
build
you
a
blacksmith's
shop
with
the
proceeds,
that
will
be
a
value
to
you
or
we'll
build
you
a
school
house
with
the
money
that
will
be
of
use
to
you,
or
we'll
buy
you
fertilizer
for
your
farms
that
will
of
value
to
you.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
proceeds
would
have
been
a
value
to
the
indians
but
i
take
it,
maybe
i
am
wrong,
i
take
it
the
petitioners
concede
that
in
those
situations
they
would
not
now
be
entitled
to
the
value
that
the
blacksmith
shop
or
the
fertilizer
or
the
school
house
would
have
been
to
them
over
a
110
years.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
right
because
there
is
no
dispute
but
there
is
no
undertaking.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
but
this
act
while
remedying
the
principle
wrong
does
not
remedy
the
delay
that
it
took
congress
to
get
around
to
passing
the
act.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
at
least
i
take
it
that
the
petitioners
don't
suggest
that
the
claims
commission
act
provides
their
remedy.
the
position
is
there
has
be
that
article
7
provides
the
predecessor
for
their
remedy
and
that
article
7
is
a
obligation
on
the
treasury
to
pay
interest
and
we
see
it
as
different
than
undertaking
to
build
a
blacksmith's
shop.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely.
even
if
it
was
--
i
should
qualify
that
if
it
was
deemed
that
the
amount
was
sufficiently
determined
but
i
suppose
you
know
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i'd
suppose
you'd
have
a
statute
of
limitations
which
we
--
which
the
government
has
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
or
laches
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
except
for
the
two
cases
that
have
been
given
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
i
understand,
in
the
general
case
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
unless
the
claim
could
be
squeezed
into
the
fifth
amendment
interest
has
been
denied?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
were
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right
sir,
indeed
i
think
there
was
a
fairly
careful
appraisal
of
what
the
likely
costs
of
legislation
regarding
the
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
thank
you
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
that
the
past
cases
are
water
over
the
dam.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
involve
splitting
a
cause
of
action,
that's
just
the
breaks
in
civil
ligations
usually.
there
are
great
many
cases
of
course.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
i
suppose
the
special
legislation.
now
a
great
reliance
has
been
placed
by
the
petitioners
on
two
particular
cases
which
i
think
serve
to
dramatize
the
different
situation
we
have
now.
i
refer
to
both
blackfeather
and
the
mille
lac
case.
i
think
the
language
in
blackfeather
shows
what
a
real
obligation
to
pay
interest
is.
there
the
treaty
expressly
provided
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
the
chiefs
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
their
people
annually
5%
as
an
annuity.
now
whatever
the
words
as
an
annuity
may
have
meant
this
court
had
little
trouble
in
finding
that
that
treaty
contained
a
contract
expressly
stipulating
for
inference.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
something
like
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
there
--
i
don't
think
so,
the
critical
difference
is
that
there
everyone
knew
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into
that
the
treasury
was
going
to
pay
out
5%
per
annum.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
during
the
pleasure
of
course
everything
is
sir,
it
ends
up
that
way.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right,
i
suppose
there
is
a
condition
or
something
to
point
that
never
occurred.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
maybe
its
minimal
but
at
least
there
is
a
language
that
sounds
like
a
bond,
that
sounds
like
an
obligation
of
the
treasury.
even
more
so
in
mille
lac
which
they
--
which
petitioner's
cite.
there
all
money
accruing
from
the
disposal
of
said
land
shall
be
placed
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
the
credit
of
the
chippewa
indians
as
a
permanent
fund
which
shall
draw
interest
at
the
rate
of
5%
per
annum.
now
that
we
submit
is
the
sort
of
language
that
meets
the
test
or
it
meets
the
standard
of
an
express
consent
to
pay
interest.
article
7
contains
no
undertaking
that
anyway
resembles
that.
moreover
and
this
is
particularly
important
thing,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
language
of
the
peoria
treaty
is
not
some
accident
or
fluke
of
draftsmanship.
the
treaty
in
1854
followed
upon
reports
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
which
were
transmitted
to
congress
by
the
president
in
1852
and
1853
urging
the
discontinuance
of
the
practice
of
holding
indian
funds
in
the
treasury
and
appropriating
annual
interest
payments.
it
was
urged
that
the
investment
of
such
funds
in
marketable
securities
would
reduce
the
treasury's
surplus,
would
benefit
the
national
economy
and
most
important
would
relieve
the
government
from
the
payment
of
the
immense
sums
which
the
annual
interest
must
eventually
amount
to.
that
would
seem
to
make
it
very
clear
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
assume
a
liability
for
interest.
that
the
purpose
was
the
very
opposite
to
relieve
the
treasury
of
that
burden.
under
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
entirely
right
in
concluding
that
it
would
be
judicial
treaty
writing
to
read
into
that
agreement
an
express
promise
by
the
government
to
pay
interest
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
judicial
treaty
writing
is
what
petitioners
really
have
in
mind.
in
the
language
that
was
referred
to
earlier
they
asked
for
an
award
of
6%
from
1857
to
1860
and
5%
from
1860
to
1934
and
at
such
rate
as
this
court
deems
appropriate
thereafter.
now
its
perfectly
clear
that
article
7
nothing
about
5%.
it
says
nothing
about
6%
and
it
certainly
says
nothing
about
such
rate
as
this
court
deems
appropriate.
now
perhaps
by
way
of
confession
and
avoidance
petitioners
seek
to
escape
from
the
government's
immunity
to
liability
for
interest
by
urging
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
government
has
misrepresented
the
nature
of
their
claim.
they
do
not
they
say
seek
interest
on
a
claim
but
rather
damages
measured
by
interest
for
the
failure
to
invest
under
the
express
provisions
of
article
7.
now
this
distinction
between
interest
on
a
claim
and
damages
measured
by
interest
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
the
two
are
tweedledee
and
tweedledum.
their
brief
--
at
least
the
distinction
is
so
illusive
that
it
eluded
petitioners
until
now,
because
in
their
brief
in
the
court
of
claims
they
clearly
said
that
this
appeal
seeks
the
recovery
of
interest
on
an
award
of
damages
and
that
is
how
the
court
of
claims
understood
it
and
that's
how
the
indian
claims
commission
understood
it.
furthermore
i
think
it's
helpful
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
case
involves
the
breach
of
one
provision,
not
two
provisions
of
the
treaty.
unquestionably
the
land
was
not
sold
in
the
manner
provided
in
article
4.
but
there's
no
claim
or
at
least
there
wasn't
until
today,
that
the
united
states
was
guilty
of
any
default
under
article
7.
that
is
to
say
the
money
that
was
actually
received
from
the
sale
and
was
allocated
by
the
president
for
investment
was
in
fact
invested
and
the
income
was
scrupulously
applied
to
the
petitioner's
benefit.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
no
independent
misconduct
is
what
i'm
suggesting
under
section
7,
no
independent
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
mean
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
for
a
minute
that
these
indians
were
not
badly
treated,
they
were.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
analyzing
the
language
of
the
treaty
there
was
--
it's
not
a
point
worth
pressing.
there
was
not
an
independent
breach
under
article
7.
no
one
took
proceeds
which
he
did
not
pay
over
pay
over
to
the
indians
and
failed
to
invest
this.
no
one
ran
off
with
the
income
from
those
investments.
when
it
came
to
article
7
what
came
under
the
purview
of
article
7
was
properly
dealt
with.
now
more
should
have
come
in
i
agree.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
can't
--
i
don't
know
what
it
means
to
say
that
it's
a
misconduct
of
congress
not
to
have
passed
the
indian
claims.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
we
can
say
that
congress
ought
to
have
to
passed
this
act
a
long
time
ago,
but
i
don't
find
that
illuminating
as
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
land
had
long
since
been
sold.
the
land
was
sold
when
it
was
supposed
to
be
sold,
the
problem
was
the
price
at
which
it
was
sold.
the
president
of
course
had
a
very
difficult
problem
in
1857,
there
were
people
who
had
built
homes
on
this
land.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
i
suppose
that
the
critical
thing
is
that
congress
could
have
appropriated
the
money
that
was
the
difference
long
ago
and
it
didn't,
and
no
doubt
about
it.
all
i
meant
to
suggest
is
that
there
are
really
two
categories
of
injury
flowing
from
the
original
fair
and
it
was
grievance
fair,
no
doubt
about
it.
one
is
the
indians
didn't
have
the
full
value
of
their
land
in
1857
and
were
aggrieved
about
that.
the
judgment
has
been
entered
for
that
for
$172,000.
the
second
category
of
injury
and
it's
one
common
in
all
litigation
is
that
they
did
have
the
use
of
that
money
over
110
years.
now
is
the
sort
of
injury,
the
sort
of
damage
that
under
any
of
the
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
congress
has
generally
declined
to
provide
a
remedy
for
it.
it
has
generally
declined
to
pay
for
it's
own
delay
in
providing
a
remedy.
as
justice
holmes
said
in
a
non-indian
case
for
the
court,
boston
sand
&
gravel
v.
united
states
in
278
u.s.
congress
distinguishes
between
the
underlying
damages
and
the
later
loss
caused
by
delay
in
paying
for
the
first,
between
damages
and
the
allowance
of
interest
on
damages.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
that
was
rights
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
undertaken
to
pay
for
a
ship
that
it
has
destroyed.
he
said
congress
undertook
to
have
a
court
find
the
value
of
the
ship
that
was
destroyed,
but
the
fact
that
you
haven't
had
that
ship
for
the
last
decade
is
not
what
congress
undertook
to
pay
for.
i
also
think
it's
worth
noting
in
this
connection
very
briefly
that
petitioners
claim
for
damages
measured
by
interest
is
in
it's
nature
a
claim
that
accrues
over
time,
year-by-year,
yet
the
indian
claims
commission
act
expressly
provides
that
commission
shall
not
consider
any
claim
accruing
after
1946.
now
at
very
least
that
means,
i
suppose
that
the
commission
isn't
entitled
to
award
interest
for
the
last
20
odd
years,
an
amount
greater
than
the
underlying
claim
in
fact.
but
i
also
suggest
that
it
reflects
a
congressional
intention
or
expectation
that
generally
they
were
not
dealing
with
claims,
the
sort
of
interest
that
accrue
over
time.
petitioners
urge
finally
in
their
applied
brief
that
the
purpose
of
these
proceedings
is
to
put
the
indians
in
the
position
they
would
have
enjoyed
had
the
government
complied
with
the
treaty.
that
view
we
submit
would
require
the
payment
of
interest
in
every
case,
for
every
claim
against
the
united
states
is
based
on
some
dereliction
and
in
every
case
there
is
a
period
of
delay
before
payment
is
made,
during
which
some
value
is
denied.
we
submit
that
in
waiving
one
or
another
aspect
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
in
the
tucker
act
and
the
tort
claims
act
or
the
indian
claims
act,
congress
has
not
gone
that
far
and
we
urge
that
in
this
area
where
congress
has
slowly
but
progressively
liberalized
the
law,
where
congress
has
not
gone,
this
court
ought
not
follow.
thank
you.
