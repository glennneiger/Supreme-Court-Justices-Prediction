mr.
jack
joseph
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peoria
indians
the
petitioners
here
recovered
a
judgment
for
approximately
the
amount
of
$172,000
before
the
indian
claims
commissions
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
had
failed
to
comply
with
provisions
of
article
4
of
the
treaty
of
may
30,
1854
to
sell
the
petitioners'
lands
at
a
public
auctions
and
instead
had
sold
them
at
fixed
prices
thus
returning
the
indians
a
smaller
award.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
this
judgment,
but
the
petitioners
did
appeal
because
we
contend
we
are
--
that
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
an
additional
award
measured
by
interest
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
the
united
states
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
article
7
of
that
same
treaty
requiring
that
the
$172,000
which
should
have
been
realized
be
invested.
the
appeal
that
we
took
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
under
the
provisions
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act
resulted
in
a
decision
adverse
to
us
with
three
judges
writing
majority
opinion,
opinion
by
chief
judge
cowen
and
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
of
two
judges,
written
by
judge
davis,
taking
the
view
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
relief
which
we
sought.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
they
have
been
established
by
the
decision
of
the
indian
claims
commission
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
claims
and
they're
as
follows.
on
and
prior
to
may
30,
1854
peoria
indians
owned
a
small
tract
of
land
on
the
eastern
boundary
of
kansas.
on
that
date,
the
kansas-nebraska
act
became
effective
which
opened
up
kansas
to
settlement
by
non-indians.
on
that
same
day,
this
treaty
with
the
petitioners
was
made
wherein
the
indians
and
the
united
states
agreed
that
the
indians
would
convey
their
lands
to
the
united
states,
the
united
states
would
sell
them
at
a
public
auction
for
the
benefit
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
jack
joseph
no,
i
haven't
--
mr.
jack
joseph
upon
the
passage
of
the
kansas-nebraska
act,
the
non-indians
moved
over
into
kansas
and
squatted
on
the
lands
including
the
lands
of
the
petitioner.
the
squatters
pressured
--
put
pressure
upon
the
government
to
buy
these
lands
under
the
public
land
laws
which
entitled
the
first
settler
on
a
tract
of
land
to
purchase
that
land
for
a
fixed
price
under
the
land
laws
prevailing
at
that
time
and
the
fixed
price
was
a
$1.25.
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
requested
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
proper
to
sell
to
the
squatters
on
the
peoria
lands,
the
tracts
on
which
they
had
squatted
under
the
preemption
statutes,
and
the
attorney
general
of
course
answered
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
treaty,
a
breach
of
trust
and
a
fraud
upon
the
indians
because
the
bargain
which
the
indians
had
made
was
for
a
public
auction.
despite
the
attorney
general's
statement
or
opinion,
official
opinion,
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
expressly
instructed
that
the
land
be
sold
in
a
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
squatters
on
it
the
right
to
buy
it
at
fixed
price,
the
equivalent
of
preemption
rights.
the
indians
claims
commission
found
that
had
the
lands
been
sold
under
a
public
auction,
the
way
the
indians
had
agreed
that
a
$172,000
approximately
additional
would
have
been
realized
than
was
actually
realized
and
the
judgment
which
was
entered
here
was
for
that
amount.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
under
article
7
of
this
treaty,
we
should
have
had
an
additional
award
measured
by
interest.
article
7
which
is
reprinted
several
times
in
the
briefs
among
other
places
on
page
2,
says
in
part,
“and
as
the
amount
of
the
annual
receipts
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
cannot
now
be
ascertained,
it
is
agreed
that
the
president
may
from
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
the
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
such
sales
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks,
the
interest
to
be
annually
paid
to
them
or
expanded
for
their
benefit
and
improvement.”
in
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
past
mille
lac
and
the
blackfeather
cases
which
are
cited
on
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
provisions
to
return
income
from
the
indians
capital
in
land
sales
applied
in
a
--
to
proceeds
which
should
have
been
realized
as
well
as
those
which
were
actually
realized.
petitioners
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
those
cases
is
in
accord
with
the
traditional
principle
contract
law
and
should
have
been
applied
by
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
mille
lacs
band
of
chippewa
case
and
the
united
states
versus
blackfeather.
mr.
jack
joseph
mille
lac,
m-i-l-l-e
l-a-c.
mr.
jack
joseph
that's
right.
mr.
jack
joseph
we
believe
the
principle
at
work
is
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
they
made
that
they
are
--
that
the
purpose
of
a
proceeding
to
enforce
a
contract
is
to
put
the
indians
or
any
party
who
suffers
by
a
breach
of
the
contract
in
the
position
that
he
would
have
been
had
the
contract
been
fulfilled.
mr.
jack
joseph
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
joseph
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas,
correct.
mr.
jack
joseph
no,
the
argument
we
are
making
here
is
based
on
article
7
of
the
treaty
in
context.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
for
that
reason
mr.
justice
fortas
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
jack
joseph
our
position
is
that
the
indians
were
entitled
to
have
invested
anything
which
was
not
paid
over
to
them
in
1857
by
virtue
of
article
7
of
this
treaty
that
consequently
none
of
the
$172,000
having
been
paid
over
in
1857
became
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
article.
therefore
the
indians
suffered
the
loss
of
the
income
which
should
have
been
earned
on
it
and
therefore
entitled
to
recover
that
amount.
because
this
--
mr.
jack
joseph
this
suit
was
brought
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act
which
is
a
general
jurisdictional
act
giving
indian
tribes
in
general
a
right
to
bring
actions
of
any
kind,
that
law
and
equity,
some
of
which
and
some
additional
kinds,
those
which
violate
a
standard
fair
and
honorable
dealings
before
a
tribunal
which
is
created
by
the
act
called
the
indian
claims
commission.
the
act
provides
that
all
of
the
petitions
which
indians
might
file
before
the
commission
had
to
be
filed
before
a
date
certain
and
that
date
has
been
passed.
it
also
provides
that
the
united
states
waives
the
defenses
of
laches
and
the
statue
of
limitations.
under
this
act
some
800
or
so
claims
have
been
filed,
of
which
this
was
one.
it's
general
jurisdictional
act.
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
claim
any
special
rights
here
before
this
court
by
virtue
of
the
act,
only
the
general
doctrine
that
courts
will
enforce
contractual
obligations
against
the
united
states.
now
the
chief
defense
that
has
been
raised
to
our
plea
for
return
under
this
article
is
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
which
the
united
states
says
that
it
is
not
liable
for
interest
on
claims.
and
it
points
to
two
aspects
about
the
treaty
in
support
of
its
argument,
one
is
the
discretion
of
the
president
and
the
other
the
fact
that
a
specific
rate
of
interest
is
not
mentioned
in
article
7.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
have
not
--
to
answer
you
second
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
first
i
have
not
figured
that
count
to
the
penny,
but
i
believe
that
just
for
purposes
of
our
discussion
here
that
the
judgment
with
principal
plus
interest
would
be
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million
if
the
court
--
mr.
jack
joseph
i
say
it
would
be
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million.
the
interest
at
5%
doubles
the
money
in
20
years
and
we
have
approximately
110
or
111
years
here.
to
answer
your
first
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jack
joseph
20
years.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
simple
interest
that
is
what
we
are
asking
for,
simple
interest.
mr.
jack
joseph
as
i
say
i
have
not
calculated
and
i've
made
a
rough
calculation.
i
think
it
is
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million.
it's
a
simple
arithmetical
process.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
reason
--
mr.
jack
joseph
oh
yes,
i
was
about
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
--
in
general
from
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
to
date
united
states
has
paid
5%
on
obligations
which
it
owes
to
the
indians.
i
suggested
two
variations
which
the
court
might
consider
in
that
rate
in
this
case,
one
in
favor
of
the
indians
and
one
against
the
indians.
the
reason
i
suggest
that
6%
up
to
1860
is
because
it
appears
that
the
--
that,
that
part
of
the
proceeds
which
were
actually
realized,
those
sales
in
1857
were
invested
in
securities
which
returned
a
minimum
of
6%.
after
1860
it
appears
that
the
funds
were
replaced
by
a
--
the
securities
were
replaced
by
a
fund
in
the
treasury
which
bore
5%
interest.
the
united
states
has
paid
5%
interest
on
indian
funds
up
until
the
1930s
when
congress
in
the
statute
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
amount
of
interest
reduced
the
rate
from
5%
to
4%.
so
that
is
the
reason
for
these
three
rates.
now
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
which
is
the
major
issue
raised
by
the
--
or
perhaps
the
only
issue
if
i
read
them
correctly,
that
the
government
raises
does
not
apply
to
contractual
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
in
that
sense
since
we
are
claiming
under
a
contractual
obligation,
if
this
contract
says
we
are
entitled
to
the
allowance
to
the
relief
of
which
we
seek,
the
doctrine
of
--
we
are
without
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
contract
doesn't
provide
for
it,
the
court
doesn't
need
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
to
deny
us
the
interest
because
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
contract
that
we
are
claiming,
so
in
that
sense
the
whole
discussion
of
sovereign
immunity
is
in
apposite.
now
we
come
to
look
at
the
words
of
article
7
and
i
would
--
i
think
here
even
though
the
court
of
claims
really
agrees
that
this
treaty
says
what
we
say
it
does,
the
court
below
treated
it
as
an
interpretation
problem
and
in
doing
so
they
considered
it
in
the
light
of
various
rules
which
construe
contracts
strongly
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
against
claimants
and
they
make
no
mention
of
the
long
line
of
cases
which
are
cited
by
judge
davis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
which
say
that
treaties
within
indians
should
be
interpreted
favorably,
in
favor
of
the
indians,
in
the
spirit
of
generosity.
but
actually
i
don't
really
think
this
is
an
interpretation
problem,
because
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
minority
in
the
court
of
claims
and
i
believe
the
government
if
i
understand
their
position
here,
and
we
all
agree
that
what
this
treaty
meant
was
that
the
proceeds
received
from
sales
of
these
lands
were
either
to
be
paid
immediately
over
or
were
to
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
what
we
are
arguing
about
is
what
the
effect
is
of
that
provision,
that
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
provision
was
intended
to
meet.
now
there
are
two
things
which
the
government
looks
at
as
i
say
and
i
think
that
they
are
--
can
be
analyzed
separately,
one
of
those
the
discretion
which
the
president
had.
that
is,
point
to
the
language,
the
president
may
from
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
the
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
the
sale
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
the
government
says
in
various
ways
that
you
cannot
know
how
much
you
might
have
pay
over
to
them
and
therefore
how
can
we
make
any
award.
mr.
jack
joseph
well
i
think
if
that's
all
said,
that
i
wouldn't
be
here
claiming
it
your
honor.
mr.
jack
joseph
well
--
mr.
jack
joseph
there
are
some
cases
--
mr.
jack
joseph
i
think
the
indians
would
have
--
would
still
have
a
strong
claim.
under
the
monomoy
case
decided
by
the
court
of
claims,
the
delay
in
payment
when
it
should
have
been
paid
does
give
rise
to
an
obligation
for
interest.
however
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
oh
no,
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
take
that
position
because
--
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
in
that
case
i
think
that
we
would
--
that
if
the
united
states
does
not
invest
proceeds
that
the
indians
would
have
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
what
would
have
been
received
had
the
--
mr.
jack
joseph
and
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
no.
perhaps
they
do
not
concede
it
because
--
no,
i
would
say
the
government
concedes
it
because
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
argument
that
we
wouldn't
know
how
much
the
investment
would
return,
that
is
might
have
been
a
bad
investment,
the
united
states
might
have
invested
the
indians
money
in
something
very
bad.
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
argument
of
course
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
argument
unbecoming
of
the
trustee
and
one
which
trustees
have
not
been
successful
with
anywhere
and
that
the
united
states
here
assumed
the
duties
of
a
trustee.
on
this
discretionary
aspect,
i
think
the
first
thing
that
militates
against
the
government's
position
are
again
mille
lac
and
blackfeather
cases
because
in
both
of
those
cases
we
had
an
element
in
which
the
government
had
the
option
to
pay
over
rather
than
invest.
in
the
mille
lac
case
the
statute
which
embodied
the
agreement
provided
that
with
respect
to
a
portion
of
the
fund,
5%
not
the
whole
fund
as
in
our
case,
congress
could
agree
to
appropriate
--
not
to
put
the
money
in
an
interest
bearing
fund
but
could
agree
to
take
it
out
and
spend
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
later,
in
the
lawsuit
in
which
it
was
found
that
the
united
states
breached
its
contract
to
the
indians
by
selling
mille
lac's
land
under
the
government
land
laws
instead
of
at
a
public
auction
and
damages
were
awarded.
the
fact
of
discretion,
that
there
was
discretion
given
to
congress
in
that
case
did
not
affect
the
result.
similarly,
in
the
blackfeather
case
and
an
analysis
of
that
appears
in
the
next
to
last
paragraph
of
judge
davis'
opinion
and
i
submit
that
his
statement
about
it
has
not
been
answered.
the
united
states
had
the
option
to
pay
over
the
fund
after
consultation
with
the
indians
and
before
the
lawsuit
was
even
brought,
the
fund
which
had
been
realized
was
paid
over
to
the
indians.
when
the
lawsuit
was
brought
after
the
fund
had
been
completely
paid
over
that
is
the
fund
that
had
been
realized
and
the
court
found
that
there
should
have
been
additional
proceeds
realized,
the
court
held
that
as
to
those
additional
proceeds
since
they
were
not
paid
over,
interest
would
be
allowed
on
them
till
the
date
of
payment
and
the
fact
that
they
might
have
been
paid,
that
the
discretion
might
have
been
exercised
had
the
money
been
realized
earlier
was
irrelevant.
now
i
can
see
no
difference
between
the
blackfeather
case
and
the
case
we
have
at
bar.
and
when
you
come
to
look
at
it,
the
blackfeather
and
the
mille
lac
case
and
this
case
should
be
governed
the
same
way
because
after
all
the
money
wasn't
realized
not
because
there
was
an
act
--
a
discretionary
decision
by
the
president,
but
rather
because
there
was
a
breach
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states.
the
fund
was
not
realized
by
a
reason
of
a
deliberate
breach
and
therefore
the
money
did
not
become
subject
to
article
7
and
if
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
is
allowed
to
stand
what
the
affect
is
to
condone
neither
paying
nor
investing
the
amount,
the
$172,000
which
should
have
been
realized
and
depriving
the
indians
of
the
benefit
of
their
bargain.
now,
another
aspect
of
the
discretion
involved
here
is
--
mr.
jack
joseph
as
judge
davis
points
out,
it
was
expressed
in
terms
of
paying
the
indians
an
annuity
and
the
court
looked
through
that
and
said
yes
what
this
means
is
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
covenant
to
pay
interest.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
--
i
cited
some
material
which
i
believe
shows
that
the
united
states
actually
treated
this
as
a
covenant
to
pay
interest.
in
the
1850s,
there
were
a
number
of
indian
treaties
which
provided
that
the
indians
should
get
a
return
on
safe
and
profitable
stocks
because
says
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
the
report
cited
by
judge
davis,
that
the
embarrassed
condition
of
the
treasury
and
other
causes,
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
appropriate
the
money
to
purchase
the
safe
and
profitable
stocks
and
instead
appropriated
the
interest
annually
at
the
rate
of
5%.
so,
congress
itself
considered
that
the
return
of
5%
interest
was
the
equivalent
of
investing
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
the
other
thing
is
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
united
states
here
assumed
the
duties
of
a
trustee
and
specifically
assumed
the
duty
of
a
trustee
to
pay
over
or
invest,
and
that
we
can
look
to
trust
law
to
determine
what
kind
of
damages
are
recoverable
from
a
trustee.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
when
the
united
states
expressly
assumes
a
duty
as
a
trustee
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
trustee
and
i
think
that
is
in
accord
with
the
indian
laws
as
it
is,
i
don't
--
it
is
not
that
--
that
is
when
they
expressly
assume
it
by
contract.
now,
not
out
of
their
mere
existence
of
an
obligation.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor,
you
are
right.
but
it
is
our
position
that
article
7
of
this
treaty
is
an
explicit
assumption
of
the
kind
of
trust
that
a
normal
trustee
assumes
when
he
undertakes
to
manage
somebody
else's
money
and
that
the
indians
are
entitled
therefore
to
the
kind
of
relief
against
the
united
states
in
this
case
because
of
this
provision
that
would
be
obtainable
against
a
private
trustee
in
similar
circumstances.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
in
error,
that
its
decision
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
indian
claims
commission
for
--
with
instructions
to
enter
an
additional
judgment
equivalent
to
interest
against
united
states,
thank
you.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
don't
think
i
have
a
reply
unless
the
court
is
interested
--
mr.
jack
joseph
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peoria
indians
the
petitioners
here
recovered
a
judgment
for
approximately
the
amount
of
$172,000
before
the
indian
claims
commissions
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
had
failed
to
comply
with
provisions
of
article
4
of
the
treaty
of
may
30,
1854
to
sell
the
petitioners'
lands
at
a
public
auctions
and
instead
had
sold
them
at
fixed
prices
thus
returning
the
indians
a
smaller
award.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
this
judgment,
but
the
petitioners
did
appeal
because
we
contend
we
are
--
that
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
an
additional
award
measured
by
interest
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
the
united
states
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
article
7
of
that
same
treaty
requiring
that
the
$172,000
which
should
have
been
realized
be
invested.
the
appeal
that
we
took
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
under
the
provisions
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act
resulted
in
a
decision
adverse
to
us
with
three
judges
writing
majority
opinion,
opinion
by
chief
judge
cowen
and
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
of
two
judges,
written
by
judge
davis,
taking
the
view
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
relief
which
we
sought.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
they
have
been
established
by
the
decision
of
the
indian
claims
commission
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
claims
and
they're
as
follows.
on
and
prior
to
may
30,
1854
peoria
indians
owned
a
small
tract
of
land
on
the
eastern
boundary
of
kansas.
on
that
date,
the
kansas-nebraska
act
became
effective
which
opened
up
kansas
to
settlement
by
non-indians.
on
that
same
day,
this
treaty
with
the
petitioners
was
made
wherein
the
indians
and
the
united
states
agreed
that
the
indians
would
convey
their
lands
to
the
united
states,
the
united
states
would
sell
them
at
a
public
auction
for
the
benefit
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
jack
joseph
no,
i
haven't
--
mr.
jack
joseph
upon
the
passage
of
the
kansas-nebraska
act,
the
non-indians
moved
over
into
kansas
and
squatted
on
the
lands
including
the
lands
of
the
petitioner.
the
squatters
pressured
--
put
pressure
upon
the
government
to
buy
these
lands
under
the
public
land
laws
which
entitled
the
first
settler
on
a
tract
of
land
to
purchase
that
land
for
a
fixed
price
under
the
land
laws
prevailing
at
that
time
and
the
fixed
price
was
a
$1.25.
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
requested
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
proper
to
sell
to
the
squatters
on
the
peoria
lands,
the
tracts
on
which
they
had
squatted
under
the
preemption
statutes,
and
the
attorney
general
of
course
answered
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
treaty,
a
breach
of
trust
and
a
fraud
upon
the
indians
because
the
bargain
which
the
indians
had
made
was
for
a
public
auction.
despite
the
attorney
general's
statement
or
opinion,
official
opinion,
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
expressly
instructed
that
the
land
be
sold
in
a
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
squatters
on
it
the
right
to
buy
it
at
fixed
price,
the
equivalent
of
preemption
rights.
the
indians
claims
commission
found
that
had
the
lands
been
sold
under
a
public
auction,
the
way
the
indians
had
agreed
that
a
$172,000
approximately
additional
would
have
been
realized
than
was
actually
realized
and
the
judgment
which
was
entered
here
was
for
that
amount.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
under
article
7
of
this
treaty,
we
should
have
had
an
additional
award
measured
by
interest.
article
7
which
is
reprinted
several
times
in
the
briefs
among
other
places
on
page
2,
says
in
part,
“and
as
the
amount
of
the
annual
receipts
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
cannot
now
be
ascertained,
it
is
agreed
that
the
president
may
from
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
the
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
such
sales
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks,
the
interest
to
be
annually
paid
to
them
or
expanded
for
their
benefit
and
improvement.”
in
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
past
mille
lac
and
the
blackfeather
cases
which
are
cited
on
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
provisions
to
return
income
from
the
indians
capital
in
land
sales
applied
in
a
--
to
proceeds
which
should
have
been
realized
as
well
as
those
which
were
actually
realized.
petitioners
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
those
cases
is
in
accord
with
the
traditional
principle
contract
law
and
should
have
been
applied
by
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
mille
lacs
band
of
chippewa
case
and
the
united
states
versus
blackfeather.
mr.
jack
joseph
mille
lac,
m-i-l-l-e
l-a-c.
mr.
jack
joseph
that's
right.
mr.
jack
joseph
we
believe
the
principle
at
work
is
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
they
made
that
they
are
--
that
the
purpose
of
a
proceeding
to
enforce
a
contract
is
to
put
the
indians
or
any
party
who
suffers
by
a
breach
of
the
contract
in
the
position
that
he
would
have
been
had
the
contract
been
fulfilled.
mr.
jack
joseph
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
joseph
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas,
correct.
mr.
jack
joseph
no,
the
argument
we
are
making
here
is
based
on
article
7
of
the
treaty
in
context.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
for
that
reason
mr.
justice
fortas
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
jack
joseph
our
position
is
that
the
indians
were
entitled
to
have
invested
anything
which
was
not
paid
over
to
them
in
1857
by
virtue
of
article
7
of
this
treaty
that
consequently
none
of
the
$172,000
having
been
paid
over
in
1857
became
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
article.
therefore
the
indians
suffered
the
loss
of
the
income
which
should
have
been
earned
on
it
and
therefore
entitled
to
recover
that
amount.
because
this
--
mr.
jack
joseph
this
suit
was
brought
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act
which
is
a
general
jurisdictional
act
giving
indian
tribes
in
general
a
right
to
bring
actions
of
any
kind,
that
law
and
equity,
some
of
which
and
some
additional
kinds,
those
which
violate
a
standard
fair
and
honorable
dealings
before
a
tribunal
which
is
created
by
the
act
called
the
indian
claims
commission.
the
act
provides
that
all
of
the
petitions
which
indians
might
file
before
the
commission
had
to
be
filed
before
a
date
certain
and
that
date
has
been
passed.
it
also
provides
that
the
united
states
waives
the
defenses
of
laches
and
the
statue
of
limitations.
under
this
act
some
800
or
so
claims
have
been
filed,
of
which
this
was
one.
it's
general
jurisdictional
act.
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
claim
any
special
rights
here
before
this
court
by
virtue
of
the
act,
only
the
general
doctrine
that
courts
will
enforce
contractual
obligations
against
the
united
states.
now
the
chief
defense
that
has
been
raised
to
our
plea
for
return
under
this
article
is
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
which
the
united
states
says
that
it
is
not
liable
for
interest
on
claims.
and
it
points
to
two
aspects
about
the
treaty
in
support
of
its
argument,
one
is
the
discretion
of
the
president
and
the
other
the
fact
that
a
specific
rate
of
interest
is
not
mentioned
in
article
7.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
have
not
--
to
answer
you
second
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
first
i
have
not
figured
that
count
to
the
penny,
but
i
believe
that
just
for
purposes
of
our
discussion
here
that
the
judgment
with
principal
plus
interest
would
be
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million
if
the
court
--
mr.
jack
joseph
i
say
it
would
be
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million.
the
interest
at
5%
doubles
the
money
in
20
years
and
we
have
approximately
110
or
111
years
here.
to
answer
your
first
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jack
joseph
20
years.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
simple
interest
that
is
what
we
are
asking
for,
simple
interest.
mr.
jack
joseph
as
i
say
i
have
not
calculated
and
i've
made
a
rough
calculation.
i
think
it
is
in
the
magnitude
of
$1
million.
it's
a
simple
arithmetical
process.
mr.
jack
joseph
the
reason
--
mr.
jack
joseph
oh
yes,
i
was
about
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
--
in
general
from
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
to
date
united
states
has
paid
5%
on
obligations
which
it
owes
to
the
indians.
i
suggested
two
variations
which
the
court
might
consider
in
that
rate
in
this
case,
one
in
favor
of
the
indians
and
one
against
the
indians.
the
reason
i
suggest
that
6%
up
to
1860
is
because
it
appears
that
the
--
that,
that
part
of
the
proceeds
which
were
actually
realized,
those
sales
in
1857
were
invested
in
securities
which
returned
a
minimum
of
6%.
after
1860
it
appears
that
the
funds
were
replaced
by
a
--
the
securities
were
replaced
by
a
fund
in
the
treasury
which
bore
5%
interest.
the
united
states
has
paid
5%
interest
on
indian
funds
up
until
the
1930s
when
congress
in
the
statute
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
amount
of
interest
reduced
the
rate
from
5%
to
4%.
so
that
is
the
reason
for
these
three
rates.
now
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
which
is
the
major
issue
raised
by
the
--
or
perhaps
the
only
issue
if
i
read
them
correctly,
that
the
government
raises
does
not
apply
to
contractual
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
in
that
sense
since
we
are
claiming
under
a
contractual
obligation,
if
this
contract
says
we
are
entitled
to
the
allowance
to
the
relief
of
which
we
seek,
the
doctrine
of
--
we
are
without
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
contract
doesn't
provide
for
it,
the
court
doesn't
need
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
to
deny
us
the
interest
because
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
contract
that
we
are
claiming,
so
in
that
sense
the
whole
discussion
of
sovereign
immunity
is
in
apposite.
now
we
come
to
look
at
the
words
of
article
7
and
i
would
--
i
think
here
even
though
the
court
of
claims
really
agrees
that
this
treaty
says
what
we
say
it
does,
the
court
below
treated
it
as
an
interpretation
problem
and
in
doing
so
they
considered
it
in
the
light
of
various
rules
which
construe
contracts
strongly
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
against
claimants
and
they
make
no
mention
of
the
long
line
of
cases
which
are
cited
by
judge
davis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
which
say
that
treaties
within
indians
should
be
interpreted
favorably,
in
favor
of
the
indians,
in
the
spirit
of
generosity.
but
actually
i
don't
really
think
this
is
an
interpretation
problem,
because
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
minority
in
the
court
of
claims
and
i
believe
the
government
if
i
understand
their
position
here,
and
we
all
agree
that
what
this
treaty
meant
was
that
the
proceeds
received
from
sales
of
these
lands
were
either
to
be
paid
immediately
over
or
were
to
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
what
we
are
arguing
about
is
what
the
effect
is
of
that
provision,
that
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
provision
was
intended
to
meet.
now
there
are
two
things
which
the
government
looks
at
as
i
say
and
i
think
that
they
are
--
can
be
analyzed
separately,
one
of
those
the
discretion
which
the
president
had.
that
is,
point
to
the
language,
the
president
may
from
time
to
time
and
upon
consultation
with
the
indians
determine
how
much
of
the
net
proceeds
of
the
sale
shall
be
paid
to
them
and
how
much
shall
be
invested
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
the
government
says
in
various
ways
that
you
cannot
know
how
much
you
might
have
pay
over
to
them
and
therefore
how
can
we
make
any
award.
mr.
jack
joseph
well
i
think
if
that's
all
said,
that
i
wouldn't
be
here
claiming
it
your
honor.
mr.
jack
joseph
well
--
mr.
jack
joseph
there
are
some
cases
--
mr.
jack
joseph
i
think
the
indians
would
have
--
would
still
have
a
strong
claim.
under
the
monomoy
case
decided
by
the
court
of
claims,
the
delay
in
payment
when
it
should
have
been
paid
does
give
rise
to
an
obligation
for
interest.
however
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
oh
no,
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
take
that
position
because
--
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
in
that
case
i
think
that
we
would
--
that
if
the
united
states
does
not
invest
proceeds
that
the
indians
would
have
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
what
would
have
been
received
had
the
--
mr.
jack
joseph
and
that
--
mr.
jack
joseph
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
no.
perhaps
they
do
not
concede
it
because
--
no,
i
would
say
the
government
concedes
it
because
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
argument
that
we
wouldn't
know
how
much
the
investment
would
return,
that
is
might
have
been
a
bad
investment,
the
united
states
might
have
invested
the
indians
money
in
something
very
bad.
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
argument
of
course
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
argument
unbecoming
of
the
trustee
and
one
which
trustees
have
not
been
successful
with
anywhere
and
that
the
united
states
here
assumed
the
duties
of
a
trustee.
on
this
discretionary
aspect,
i
think
the
first
thing
that
militates
against
the
government's
position
are
again
mille
lac
and
blackfeather
cases
because
in
both
of
those
cases
we
had
an
element
in
which
the
government
had
the
option
to
pay
over
rather
than
invest.
in
the
mille
lac
case
the
statute
which
embodied
the
agreement
provided
that
with
respect
to
a
portion
of
the
fund,
5%
not
the
whole
fund
as
in
our
case,
congress
could
agree
to
appropriate
--
not
to
put
the
money
in
an
interest
bearing
fund
but
could
agree
to
take
it
out
and
spend
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
later,
in
the
lawsuit
in
which
it
was
found
that
the
united
states
breached
its
contract
to
the
indians
by
selling
mille
lac's
land
under
the
government
land
laws
instead
of
at
a
public
auction
and
damages
were
awarded.
the
fact
of
discretion,
that
there
was
discretion
given
to
congress
in
that
case
did
not
affect
the
result.
similarly,
in
the
blackfeather
case
and
an
analysis
of
that
appears
in
the
next
to
last
paragraph
of
judge
davis'
opinion
and
i
submit
that
his
statement
about
it
has
not
been
answered.
the
united
states
had
the
option
to
pay
over
the
fund
after
consultation
with
the
indians
and
before
the
lawsuit
was
even
brought,
the
fund
which
had
been
realized
was
paid
over
to
the
indians.
when
the
lawsuit
was
brought
after
the
fund
had
been
completely
paid
over
that
is
the
fund
that
had
been
realized
and
the
court
found
that
there
should
have
been
additional
proceeds
realized,
the
court
held
that
as
to
those
additional
proceeds
since
they
were
not
paid
over,
interest
would
be
allowed
on
them
till
the
date
of
payment
and
the
fact
that
they
might
have
been
paid,
that
the
discretion
might
have
been
exercised
had
the
money
been
realized
earlier
was
irrelevant.
now
i
can
see
no
difference
between
the
blackfeather
case
and
the
case
we
have
at
bar.
and
when
you
come
to
look
at
it,
the
blackfeather
and
the
mille
lac
case
and
this
case
should
be
governed
the
same
way
because
after
all
the
money
wasn't
realized
not
because
there
was
an
act
--
a
discretionary
decision
by
the
president,
but
rather
because
there
was
a
breach
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states.
the
fund
was
not
realized
by
a
reason
of
a
deliberate
breach
and
therefore
the
money
did
not
become
subject
to
article
7
and
if
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
is
allowed
to
stand
what
the
affect
is
to
condone
neither
paying
nor
investing
the
amount,
the
$172,000
which
should
have
been
realized
and
depriving
the
indians
of
the
benefit
of
their
bargain.
now,
another
aspect
of
the
discretion
involved
here
is
--
mr.
jack
joseph
as
judge
davis
points
out,
it
was
expressed
in
terms
of
paying
the
indians
an
annuity
and
the
court
looked
through
that
and
said
yes
what
this
means
is
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
covenant
to
pay
interest.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
--
i
cited
some
material
which
i
believe
shows
that
the
united
states
actually
treated
this
as
a
covenant
to
pay
interest.
in
the
1850s,
there
were
a
number
of
indian
treaties
which
provided
that
the
indians
should
get
a
return
on
safe
and
profitable
stocks
because
says
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
the
report
cited
by
judge
davis,
that
the
embarrassed
condition
of
the
treasury
and
other
causes,
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
appropriate
the
money
to
purchase
the
safe
and
profitable
stocks
and
instead
appropriated
the
interest
annually
at
the
rate
of
5%.
so,
congress
itself
considered
that
the
return
of
5%
interest
was
the
equivalent
of
investing
in
safe
and
profitable
stocks.
the
other
thing
is
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
united
states
here
assumed
the
duties
of
a
trustee
and
specifically
assumed
the
duty
of
a
trustee
to
pay
over
or
invest,
and
that
we
can
look
to
trust
law
to
determine
what
kind
of
damages
are
recoverable
from
a
trustee.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
when
the
united
states
expressly
assumes
a
duty
as
a
trustee
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
trustee
and
i
think
that
is
in
accord
with
the
indian
laws
as
it
is,
i
don't
--
it
is
not
that
--
that
is
when
they
expressly
assume
it
by
contract.
now,
not
out
of
their
mere
existence
of
an
obligation.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
joseph
yes,
your
honor,
you
are
right.
but
it
is
our
position
that
article
7
of
this
treaty
is
an
explicit
assumption
of
the
kind
of
trust
that
a
normal
trustee
assumes
when
he
undertakes
to
manage
somebody
else's
money
and
that
the
indians
are
entitled
therefore
to
the
kind
of
relief
against
the
united
states
in
this
case
because
of
this
provision
that
would
be
obtainable
against
a
private
trustee
in
similar
circumstances.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
in
error,
that
its
decision
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
indian
claims
commission
for
--
with
instructions
to
enter
an
additional
judgment
equivalent
to
interest
against
united
states,
thank
you.
mr.
jack
joseph
i
don't
think
i
have
a
reply
unless
the
court
is
interested
--
