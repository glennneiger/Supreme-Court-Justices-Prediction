justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
precedence
supporting
your
position
here?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
tell
me
what
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
treble-damage
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
i
have
read
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it
and
since
the
clayton
act
in
all
of
the
treble-damage
cases
that
have
been
litigated,
this
theory
appears
in
none
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
practically
every
--
well
in
the
great
many
treble-damage
cases
if
you
do
not
have
a
sister
or
a
brother
to
this
particular
one,
you
have
got
cousins
in
which
the
tax
theory
might
have
been
applied
and
worked
out?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
stop
your
tax?
would
you
confine
your
theory
to
those
precise
cases
or
would
in
every
treble-damage
case
which
involves
exclusion
from
access
to
a
particular
product
or
a
particular
technique.
would
you
say
that
the
tax
consequence
of
the
choice
which
was
actually
made
that
as
against
the
choice
that
might
have
been
made
has
to
be
taken
into
that
account?
justice
abe
fortas
unhappily
as
you
know
mr.
carson
you
always
have
to
look
for
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
in
every
one
of
the
years
in
question
when
hanover
was
leasing
this
machinery,
hanover
had
paid
no
tax?
in
other
words
it
had
been
in
a
loss
bracket?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
carson,
i
confess
i
am
having
some
difficulty.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
do
not
understand
the
theory
to
which
this
argument
is
addressed.
i
take
it
that
we
do
not
have
before
us
the
merits
of
the
judgment
against
your
client
in
the
treble-damage
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
will
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
the
various
points
that
have
been
made
here
about
the
measure
of
damages,
the
retroactivity
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
think
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
bringing
that
before
us
that
is
say
the
condemnation
of
the
lease
what
you
have
called
lease
only
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
respect
to
the
future?
you
are
presenting
that
to
us
and
claiming
that
that
was
error?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
saying
that
because
--
is
it
because
judge
wyzanski
as
affirmed
by
this
court
made
the
order
only
prospective
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
other
case
that
treble-damages
cannot
be
properly
awarded
on
a
retroactive
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
again
may
i
ask
you,
addressing
yourself
only
to
treble-damage
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
had
been
any
theory
of
this
sort
approved
by
the
courts
in
any
treble-damage
case?
justice
abe
fortas
you
tell
me.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
question
whether
the
government
decree
was
properly
a
basis
for
the
judgment,
for
the
particular
judgment.
i
am
talking
about
the
retroactivity,
so
called
retroactivity
point
in
any
treble-damage
case
which
supports
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well
damages
--
damages
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
damages
all
throughout
the
law
and
particularly
in
antitrust
law
is
something
of
an
artificial
concept,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
congressional
direction
to
unring
the
bell
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
unring
the
bell,
unring
bell,
it
is
not
the
same
as
a
congressional
direction
to
try
to
unravel
unravelable
events
and
thus
speculate
as
to
what
would
have
happened
if
the
world
had
been
different
and
if
the
allegedly
monopolistic
or
restrictive
practices
had
not
been
engaged
in.
and
that
is
to
say
as
i
understand
it
there
have
been
certain
conventions
that
lawyers
and
judges
have
summed
up
by
the
word
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
admire
your
candor
in
suggesting
that
the
consequence
of
your
approach
in
this
case
would
--
and
the
candor
of
your
arithmetic
in
suggesting
consequence
of
the
approach
in
this
case
in
that
liability
would
be
found,
would
be
no
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what's
been
bothering
me
mr.
carson
is
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
trying
to
think
about
analogous
situations
as
we
do
roughly
now
in
analogous
situations
that
that
would
probably
the
consequence
of
the
adoption
of
your
theory
and
great
many
treble-damage
cases
right
across
the
boards
that
you
can
confine
it
to
the
case
of
the
left
shoe
or
the
right
shoe
or
shoe
machinery
of
this
particular
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
market
exclusion
cases
that
is
to
say
where
access
to
a
particular
product
or
particular
market
has
been
denied.
i
have
been
trying
to
reason
through
the
hypothetical
case
of
that
sort
accepting
your
theory
with
respect
to
damages?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
afraid
it
has
to
be
in
your
mind
than
it
has
to
be
in
our
mind
as
to
courts.
we
cannot
decide
your
case
in
vacuum.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
nice
if
we
could,
but
we
can't.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
in
your
mind
whether
you
have
attempted
to
answer
it
or
not.
i
asked
you
the
questions
and
you
stated
your
response.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
are
suggesting
that
we
are
to
give
that
some
way?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
context
of
the
record
as
it
appears
from
page
123
and
following.
justice
abe
fortas
the
government
counsel
said
that
he
was
not
there
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
and
judge
wyzanski
went
on
as
the
record
shows.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
are
suggesting
us
that
we
ought
to
take
this
remark
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
have
just
quoted
of
judge
wyzanski
as
having
some
legal
or
judicial
way.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
material
relating
to
the
proceedings
before
judge
wyzanski
taken
and
clear
part
of
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
the
affidavit
of

your
affidavit
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
would
consider
that
it
is
part
of
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
because
--
was
there
any
objection
that
you're
including
that
as
annexed
to
you
affidavit?
justice
abe
fortas
judge
wyzanski
said
he
would
not
going
to
pass
on
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
precedence
supporting
your
position
here?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
tell
me
what
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
treble-damage
cases.

i

it
that
