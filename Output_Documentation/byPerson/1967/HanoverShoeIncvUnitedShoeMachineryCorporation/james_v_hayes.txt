mr.
james
v.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
case
of
hanover,
a
manufacturer
of
men's
shoes
brought
against
the
defendant,
united
for
damages
occasioned
by
united's
monopolization
of
the
shoe
machinery
trade.
hanover
leased
from
united
all
of
the
machines
involved
in
this
case
at
least
which
is
needed
in
the
manufacture
of
its
shoes.
there
were
no
comp
--
machines,
comparable
in
quality
with
the
united's
machines
which
were
available
from
any
other
domestic
or
foreign
source.
the
district
court
undisturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
united's
monopoly
position
was
from
89%
to
100%
of
the
20
most
important
machines
which
accounted
for
80%
of
the
royalties
which
hanover
paid
united,
and
it's
monopoly
position
was
from
85%
to
100%
of
all
but
six
of
the
machines
and
there
were
a
total
of
58
which
hanover
rented
from
united.
now,
all
of
those
machine
types
were
available
to
hanover
from
united
solely
on
a
lease
only
basis.
in
1947,
the
government
brought
an
action
against
united
and
i
shall
refer
to
that
action
as
the
government
action.
in
that
action,
the
district
court
held
that
united's
lease
only
policy,
the
provisions
of
its
leases
and
related
sales
policies
or
related
policies
having
to
do
with
its
relations
with
its
customers
were
exclusionary
and
illegal.
and
it
held
on
the
basis
of
its
findings
that
united
had
monopolized
the
shoe
machinery
trade.
now,
in
the
course
of
this
argument
i
am
going
to
use
the
shorthand
phrase,
leasing
system
to
describe
the
leases
and
the
bundle
of
policies
which
were
condemned
by
the
district
court
in
the
government
action.
on
the
basis
of
its
decision,
the
court
in
the
government
action
enjoined
the
leasing
system
and
directed
that,
from
the
date
to
be
fixed,
united
should
offer
no
machine
of
those
involved
for
lease
unless
it
also
offered
it
for
sale.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
the
government's
action
as
your
honors
well
know
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision.
the
decree
in
the
government
action
was
offered
and
received
in
evidence
by
the
district
court
below.
the
district
court
below
in
arriving
at
its
findings
and
conclusions
relied
on
that
decree
on
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
court
in
the
government
action
and
also
an
additional
proof
of
monopolization
which
hanover
offered
at
the
trial.
with
respect
to
damages,
hanover
offered
two
kinds
of
proof.
it's
first
kind
of
proof
what
the
district
court
refers
to
as
a
primary
claim,
consisted
of
a
comparison
between
the
rentals
which
united
actually
--
i
mean,
which
hanover,
pardon
me,
actually
paid
to
united
and
what
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
had
owned
the
machines
and
met
the
necessary
ownership
cost,
that
was
one
method.
the
second
method
was
based
on
19
instances
which
we
found
in
the
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
government
action,
instances
where
united
had
reduced
its
rents
and
royalties
on
machines
when
it
was
faced
with
competition,
with
respect
to
those
machines
and
i
might
mention
though
that
a
matter
purely
of
interest
that
the
percentage
reductions
ranged
from
11%
to
82%
and
averaged
out
at
43%.
the
district
court
held
that
with
respect
to
that
evidence
which
was
tendered
to
show
excessiveness
in
the
rents
and
royalties
themselves,
the
plaintiff,
hanover
had
failed
to
prove
excessiveness.
united
in
its
briefs
consistently
asserts
that
its
rents
and
royalties
have
been
held
reasonable.
there
is
no
such
holding
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
or
by
the
district
court
in
the
government
action.
the
holding
was
that
hanover
failed
to
prove
excessiveness
which
is
somewhat
different.
the
district
court,
however,
in
this
action
found
that
under
hanover's
primary
proof,
the
comparison
of
leasing
with
ownership
cost,
hanover
had
demonstrated
that
it
had
been
damaged
in
the
sum
of
$1,413,000.
that
is
what
had
cost
hanover
to
lease
the
machines
over
and
above
what
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
have
had
the
opportunity
in
a
free
market
to
buy
the
machines.
on
united's
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
third
circuit,
that
court
affirmed
with
respect
to
all
claims,
all
questions
having
to
do
with
liability.
and
united's
appeal
to
that
court
presented
every
question
that's
involved
in
the
conditional
cross
petition
here.
it
did,
however,
order
a
new
trial,
limited
to
damages
on
two
grounds.
the
first
of
these
grounds
is
that
the
award
of
damages
should
be
reduced
by
the
so
called
tax
benefits,
tax
disadvantages
that
ownership
would
entail
to
it
as
i
understand
the
opinion
that
if
hanover
had
been
the
owner,
it
would
not
have
had
the
advantage,
it
did
have
as
lessee
in
that
as
lessee.
it
was
able
to
deduct
all
its
rents
and
royalties
on
its
tax
returns.
and
also
that
as
owner,
hanover
would
have
had
to
pay
capital
gains
taxes
on
any
machines
itself.
now
it's
strange
to
my
poor
simple
mind
as
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
with
respect
to
the
deduction
of
the
expenses.
it
loses
me
completely
with
respect
to
the
capital
gains
because
as
i
will
mention
in
a
moment
the
reason
is
that
hanover
must
be
assumed
to
have
had
a
choice
and
you
calculate
the
damages
as
they
would
have
been
calculated
if
hanover
had
a
choice,
but
assuming
hanover
had
choice,
how
hanover
in
deciding
to
buy
the
machine
could
tell
when
and
what
amount
it
would
have
a
capital
gain
completely
escapes
me.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
if
hanover
had
purchased
machines,
it
would
have
sold
them
before
the
end
of
their
useful
lives
or
that
if
it
did
sell
them,
it
would
have
sold
them
for
more
than
the
depreciated
value
on
the
books
of
hanover.
now
this
we
submit,
this
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
so
called
tax
advantages
that
hanover
enjoyed
under
the
leasing
system
is
error.
we
start
from
one
basic
fundamental
principle
that
there
is
no
law,
that
we
have
been
able
to
discover
and
no
basis
in
fact
in
this
case
why
hanover
should
be
treated
any
differently
from
any
other
treble-damage
plaintiff.
such
plaintiffs
always
are
permitted
to
recover
the
full
damage
sustained
by
them
without
regard
to
tax
consequences.
we
haven't
found
a
single
case
which
could
see
the
so
called
tax
consequences,
may
be
cover
the
excess.
the
excess
here
was
the
amount
by
which
the
leasing
cost
exceeded
what
would
have
been
the
ownership
cost.
our
calculations
as
such
are
not
challenged.
there
is
one
challenge
that
mr.
carson
makes
that
i
will
come
to,
but
the
courts
below
did
not
challenge
them.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
district
court
we
submit
was
correct
in
its
oppose
to
this
case
was
to
disregard
what
has
been
traditionally
the
basic
rule
of
damages
that
in
approaching
damages,
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
and
this
is
a
rule
that
has
been
recognized
constantly
over
the
years,
in
both
contracts
and
torts
cases.
now
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
right.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
it
was
first
enunciated
if
i
recall
rightly
by
justice
holmes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
it
means
that
the
damage
is
measured
at
the
time
of
the
impact
of
the
wrong.
what
happens
after
that
is
just
not
considered.
that
is
as
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
here
is
rather
than
intriguing.
they
begin
with
the
finding
below,
well
supported
by
the
evidence
that
if
hanover
had
had
the
opportunity,
it
would
have
bought
the
machines.
and
then
they
do
--
they
went
to
a
bit
of
vaticination.
they
say
now
if
hanover
had
been
free
to
choose,
what
happened?
it
would
like
every
other
businessman
have
weighed
the
two
courses
open
to
it,
leasing
and
owning.
and
that
business
has
been
generally
when
weighing
such
choices,
consider
not
merely
the
gross
but
the
net,
they
consider
the
tax
consequences
that
might
be
involved
in
either
choice.
and
accordingly,
since
businessmen
would
normally
consider
the
tax
consequences,
as
if
the
tax
consequences
looked
upon
by
businessmen
would
be
inherent
in
their
choice,
damages
should
be
calculated
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
decision
whether
to
buy
or
sell
by
looking
prospectively,
retrospectively,
prospectively
at
tax
consequences.
now
to
begin
with,
i
mentioned
the
court
of
appeals
and
united
has
mentioned
of
the
so
called
tax
(inaudible).
under
the
law,
they
are
non
existent.
all
expenses
of
leasing,
all
expenses
of
ownership
are
fully
deductible
on
taxpayer's
tax
returns.
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
aside
from
going
beyond
the
first
step,
the
error
inherent
in
this
choice
reasoning
of
theirs
is
their
assumption
that
the
elements
which
are
considered
by
businessmen
in
deciding
whether
or
not
they
will
take
a
certain
business
step
are
the
elements
that
must
be
considered
by
courts
in
deciding
or
rather
in
calculating
the
amount
of
the
damage
sustained
by
an
injured
plaintiff.
that
is
a
necessary
part
of
their
error.
and
even
this
talk
of
choice
to
my
again,
poor,
simple
mind
is
beyond
the
point.
hanover
had
no
choice.
hanover,
we
have
demonstrated,
was
compelled
by
monopolization
to
pay
out
more
money
for
the
operation
of
its
business
than
it
would
have
paid
would
not
--
would
have
paid
in
a
free
market
and
they
were
forced
to
pay
it
out
because
they
operated
in
a
monopolized
market.
if
in
fact
hanover
had
a
choice,
it
could
have
been
bought
or
leased,
we
will
have
no
claim.
that
would
be
nonexistent.
it
was
the
lack
of
choice
by
which
hanover
was
injured.
and
what
hanover
might
have
done
or
hanover
might
have
considered,
assuming
it
had
a
choice
or
would
any
other
businessman
might
or
might
not
have
considered,
we
submit
is
of
utmost
of
academic
interest
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
what
was
the
amount
of
the
damage
to
hanover.
now,
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
court
of
appeals
cited
no
authority,
non
exists
which
it
could
cite.
the
nearest
approach
to
an
authority
with
the
sort
of
reasoning
it
gives,
it
said,
it's
just
as
realistic
to
deduct
taxes
as
it
was
for
the
district
court
to
require
that
in
calculating
the
damages,
the
servicing
expenses
on
the
machines
should
be
deducted.
it
is
an
equation
that
i
am
afraid
escapes
me.
it
is
a
new
part
of
my
talking
criminal
matters
but
i
am
addressing
myself
to
the
court
of
appeals'
comment.
servicing
expenses
quite
obviously
of
expenses
of
operation
that
are
met
and
paid
before
whenever
reaches
net
profit.
taxes
have
nothing
to
do
as
such
with
the
operation
of
a
business.
they
are
a
sharing
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
with
the
sovereign
of
what
the
taxpayer
has
left
after
he
has
arrived
at
his
net
profit.
now
in
no
sense
as
united
would
suggest
any
very
noble
or
unique
case.
it's
not
the
first
time
that
plaintiffs
in
antitrust
actions
have
been
damaged
by
being
forced
to
incur
greater
cost
because
of
an
antitrust
violation
than
they
would
have
incurred
absent
the
violation
and
it
very
likely
that
in
every
such
case,
the
injured
plaintiffs
deducted
those
excess
costs
on
their
tax
returns
because
there
are
operations
of
a
business,
but
it
was
never
been
suggested
that
i
can
find
that
such
plaintiffs
should
not
recover
the
full
amount
of
the
excess
cost
or
that
the
excess
cost
should
have
been
deducted
from
them
the
taxes
they
saved
because
they
deducted
the
excess
cost
on
their
tax
returns.
this
is
what
is
novel.
there
is
no
case
in
the
books
which
even
suggests
it.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honors.
the
damage
sustained
by
it,
if
i
may
paraphrase
the
statute,
was
the
full
excess
extracted
from
hanover
by
united
through
its
monopolization.
now,
one
purpose
of
damages
is
to
put
the
parties
back
in
the
positions
they
would
have
occupied
if
there
had
never
been
a
violation.
in
the
examples
in
our
briefs,
we
have
demonstrated
that
by
disregarding
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
forgetting
this
choice
business
and
tax
business,
the
parties
are
put
back
where
they
were.
but
by
taking
the
court
of
appeals
rule
and
applying
it,
using
a
50%
assumed
tax
rate,
the
result
is
that
the
united,
the
monopolizer,
the
violator
is
left
with
half
of
the
unlawful
exaction
and
the
victim,
hanover
is
out
of
pocket
the
same
amount
of
money.
we
submit
that
an
approach
which
leaves
the
wrong
doer
with
his
illegal
games
and
the
victim
out
of
profit
could
not
possibly
come
under
the
heading
of
a
symbol
on
the
top
of
the
entrance
to
this
courthouse.
now
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
a
new
trial
was
that
the
damage
period
should
be
cut
almost
halfway
through
its
full
statutory
distance
because
of
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
decision
of
this
court
on
june
10,
1946,
an
american
tobacco
case
brought
about
a
change
in
the
law
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
would
cut
off
hanover's
damages
at
that
point.
united
goes
much
further
in
its
brief.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
total
statutory
period
with
the
total
statutes
was
from
july
1,
1939
to
june
1955.
united
in
its
number
463,
looks
upon
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
defense
but
as
a
secondary
position,
united's
primary
position
is
that
the
decree
in
the
government
action
can
be
given
no
retroactive
effect
whatsoever.
it
must
be
considered
solely,
prospectively
according
to
the
united,
there
should
be
no
award
here
but
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
award
at
least
begins
the
damage
period
at
june
10,
1946.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
for
a
moment
first
to
united's
position,
we
can
find
no
authority,
no
principle,
and
the
whole
history
of
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act,
legislative
history,
cases
which
supports
united's
position
that
a
decree
in
a
government
action
shall
be
looked
upon
prospectively
only.
and
here
again,
we
submit
that
hanover
should
not
be
treated
any
differently
from
the
way
any
other
antitrust
plaintiff
is
treated,
as
the
main
antitrust
plaintiff
who
relies
on
a
decree
in
a
prior
government
case.
all
such
government
decrees
and
again,
i
apologize
for
stressing
premier
concepts,
are
based
on
the
findings
of
the
court
in
the
government
case
and
an
adjudication
of
a
violation
of
the
law
in
the
past
or
there
would
be
no
basis
for
the
decree.
and
then
the
decree
operates
prospectively
because
it
can't
operate
any
other
way
as
to
action.
it
wipes
out
the
illegal
action
or
it
wipes
out
the
conduct,
the
illegal
conduct
in
the
future,
but
it
cannot
change
the
illegal
conduct
that
it
found
to
have
existed
in
the
past.
united's
proposed
rule
is
very
interesting
one
so
far
as
further
damage
and
plaintiffs
are
concerned
and
treble-damage
plaintiffs
have
a
hard
enough
time
as
it
is
proving
their
cases.
but
per
united's
rule,
there
would
never
be
an
occasion
on
the
statutory
provision
that
the
decree
in
the
government
action
is
prima
facie
evidence
would
ever
be
possible
at
all,
because
if
decrees
operate
prospectively,
they
would
contain
no
adjudication
as
to
the
past.
now
the
fact
is
that
the
evidence
of
a
government
action
covers
many
years
going
back
to
before
the
1920's
if
i
remember
rightly.
the
findings
on
that
case
were
based
on
that
evidence
and
in
this
court's
per
curiam
enforced
affirmance,
we
find
a
very
pertinent
language
that
the
finding
of
that
case
to
government
action
now,
that
the
findings
are
justified
by
the
evidence
and
support
the
decree
and
that
is
the
decree
on
which
hanover
is
relying.
now
neither
in
that
decree
itself
or
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
of
massachusetts,
or
in
this
courts
affirmance,
is
there
any
suggestion
that
there
is
a
cut
off
at
any
particular
point?
nowhere
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
below
is
there
any
suggestion
of
a
cut
off.
there,
the
government
decree
or
the
decree
in
the
government
action,
the
findings,
the
conclusions
of
the
court
in
that
action
and
the
additional
evidence
introduced
by
hanover
covered
the
whole
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations
as
told.
the
court
of
appeals
holds
however,
now
this
is
fine,
however
while
everything
united
did
after
june
10,
1946
was
precisely
the
same
as
united
did
prior
to
june
10,
1946.
everything
united
did
after
that
date
is
unlawful
and
damages
may
be
recovered
for
it
and
everything
it
did
prior
to
that
date
was
lawful
and
there
may
be
no
damages.
now,
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
that
there
is
no
prior
case,
no
prior
rule
of
law
that
was
overruled
by
american
tobacco
or
by
alcoa.
and
both
of
those
decisions
as
we
have
pointed
out
relied
on
decisions
pre-dating
united's
adoption
of
the
leasing
system
condemned
in
the
government
action
and
they
adopted
that
in
1922.
both
justice
--
judge
hand
and
this
court
relied
on
decisions
predating
1922.
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
american
tobacco
or
alcoa
is
that
they
were
new
developments
made,
new
interpretations,
but
of
what?
of
a
statute
that
goes
back
to
1890
and
the
principles
that
have
been
established
many
years
before,
and
that
happens
constantly
in
the
antitrust
field.
there's
nothing
new
about
it,
nothing
noble
about
it.
it
does
not
mean
and
it
never
has
meant
that
such
nuances
as
they
grow
bring
about
decrees
which
have
only
prospective
effect
and
bar
any
treble-damage
action.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
relation
between
the
two.
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
james
v.
hayes
those
are
doctrines
which
generally
had
to
do
with
the
--
and
they
all
have
to
do
i
believe
with
the
enforcement
of
criminal
statutes
and
the
protection
of
constitutional
rights
either
by
providing
that
something
should
have
been
done
that
wasn't
done
or
prohibiting
something
that
was
done
that
should
not
have
been
done.
here,
we
have
a
statute
and
there
is
nothing
new,
it
has
been
upheld
time
and
time
again,
no
question
about
its
constitutionality.
it's
been
interpreted
time
and
time
again.
it
has
been
developed
time
and
time
again
by
the
courts.
if
there
were
a
real
overruling
provision
here,
i
could
see
the
relevance
of
the
criminal
cases
or
if
there
were
some
constitutional
provision
involved
here,
i
could
see
the
relevance.
otherwise
i
am
afraid
the
relevance
escapes
me.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
a
point
that
united
urges
in
its
brief.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
no
it
does
not.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
we
are
not
suing
on
the
basis
of
a
refusal
to
sell
which
is
the
way
to
get
back
to
1912.
our
suit
here
is
for
damages
due
to
monopolization.
that
monopolization
is
continuous
and
as
the
courts
below
had
found
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
every
single
time,
united
exacts
from
hanover
a
rent
and
royalty
payment
which
enables
to
exact
because
of
its
violation
of
the
law,
there
is
a
new
cause
of
action.
hanover
here
is
seeking
only
for
those
costs
to
which
it
was
exposed
by
the
monopolization
during
the
statutory
period.
it
seeks
nothing
for
what
--
for
the
costs
that
were
imposed
upon
it
prior
to
the
statutory
period.
so
i
think
this
whole
argument
about
1912
based
on
a
refusal
to
sell
which
is
not
the
basis
of
our
action,
but
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
due
to
monopolization
just
has
no
merit.
so
little
merit
that
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
even
consider,
but
that
is
my
own
personal
opinion.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
connection
between
the
two
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
stewart
very
specifically.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
there
was
a
conditional
cross
petition
mr.
justice
white.
we
petitioned
on
the
basis
of
the
two
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
for
a
new
tria,l
that
mr.
carson
filed
a
cross-petition.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
right.
335
is
hanover's
petition.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
463
is
the
cross-petition
filed
by
mr.
carson.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes,
in
its
last
point
in
its
brief
to
the
very
end.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
every
single
point
urged
in
the
cross-petition
having
to
do
with
liability
was
rejected
by
both
courts
below
and
the
tax
points
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on
was
neither
briefed
nor
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
any
other
court.
now
the
supposed
change
in
the
law
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
how
was
what
decided?
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
court
went
off
on
its
own
and
invented
or
designed
or
devised
this
rule
of
damages.
what
mr.
carson
had
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
same
position
he
primarily
takes
here
that
the
government
decree,
the
decree
in
the
government
action
had
only
prospective
effect
and
no
retroactive
effect.
that
argument
was
rejected
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
came
up
with
this,
what
i
submit
is
a
new
and
unsound
rule
of
damages
with
respect
to
taxes
--
pardon
me
not
taxes,
with
respect
to
retroactivity,
this
cutting
off
on
june
10,
1946.
if
i
said
taxes,
i
misspoke.
i
meant
the
retroactivity
of
june
10,
1940
--
to
june
10,
1946.
the
supposed
change
of
law
that
ought
to
take
in
place
on
june
10,
1946,
cane
be
phrased
very
simply.
the
law
had
been
as
a
mere
sized
on
exerted
power,
the
actions
of
predatory
practices
does
not
constitute
an
antitrust
violation.
now
if
one
looks
at
the
statute
one
finds
not
a
word
about
predatory
practices.
the
statute
speaks
about
monopolizing
commerce,
about
restraints
on
competition,
the
statute
is
aimed
at
developing
and
maintaining
a
free
market
and
the
statute
doesn't
have
any
distinction
between
polite
restraints
and
impolite
restraints,
between
gentlemanly
exclusions
from
the
market
or
ungentlemanly
exclusions
from
the
market,
but
let
us
assume
the
principle.
let
us
assume
it
is
still
the
law
that
mid-size,
un-exerted
power
do
not
constitute
a
violation.
the
trouble
with
the
principle
is
that
it
doesn't
fit
united.
there
is
no
question
that
united
have
the
size
and
the
power
with
its
tremendous
monopolistic
position
in
the
shoe
machinery
trade
particularly
the
machines
that
hanover
had
to
lease
from
it.
but
through
its
leasing
system,
which
was
condemned
in
the
government
action,
it
used
that
very
power
and
monopolistic
position
to
preserve
that
very
power
and
position
to
the
very
means
by
which
it
practically
married
the
shoe
manufacturers
to
its
monopoly,
maintaining
the
shoe
manufacturers
as
the
courts
below
has
said
as
a
captive
market
through
its
exclusion
of
competition
one
can
hardly
say
its
power
was
un-exerted,
one
certainly
cannot
deny
its
size.
the
very
success
it
met
over
the
years
by
these
exclusionary
practices
proves
that
its
maintenance
of
its
monopoly
position
is
and
its
ultimate
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
exclusionary
practices
condemned
in
the
government
action.
that
was
just
no
need
here
in
this
market
for
united
to
avoid
competition
by,
if
i
may
use
a
word
that
i
found
in
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
by
such
a
crafts
method
as
price
cutting.
it's
method
was
exclusionary.
its
method
as
the
courts
below
held
as
the
district
court
in
the
government
action
held
excluded
actual
and
potential
competition.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
basis
at
all
for
the
court
of
appeals
taking
it
up
on
itself
to
split
the
damage
period
practically
half
way
through.
we
submit
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
on
the
second
ground
of
our
petition
in
335.
now
something
that
must
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
claims
of
no
retroactivity
whether
one
considers
united's
claims
in
463
or
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
for
the
three
prior
cases
against
united.
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
united
claimed
that
it
was
resting
on
a
unique
record
of
res
judicata.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
thank
you
your
honor.
[recess]
mr.
james
v.
hayes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
again
may
it
please
the
court.
at
recess,
i
began
to
mention
that
in
the
district
court
below,
united
asserted
that
it
was
resting
on
a
unique
record
of
res
judicata
with
respect
to
the
three
prior
cases.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
on
the
oral
argument
on
the
appeal
from
the
government
action
before
this
court,
united's
counsel,
then
counsel
not
mr.
carson,
was
expressly
asked
if
he
considered
the
three
prior
cases
res
judicata
and
answered
with
a
flat
no.
united
also
claims
that
its
lease
only
policy
was
not
condemned
in
the
government
action,
and
here
again
on
that
same
appeal
on
the
government
action
but
in
the
briefs,
united's
counsel
described
the
lease
only
policy
as
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
basic
vice
in
the
system.
but
aside
from
all
that,
united
really
claims
that
the
three
prior
actions
approved
its
leasing
policy.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
this
court's
time
detailing
it,
an
analysis
of
those
cases
and
specifically
what
each
one
of
them
held
and
i
make
the
flat
statement
that
what
was
condemned
in
the
government
action
had
never
been
presented
in
this
court
before
and
accordingly
had
not
been
passed
on.
in
1922,
after
the
decision
in
the
clayton
act
case
which
throughout
all
of
the
tying
provisions
in
united's
leases,
united
adopted
the
forms
of
leases
and
leasing
policy
which
i
call
a
leasing
system
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
government
case
and
over
the
years,
it
added
some
additional
policies
which
are
also
part
of
that
leasing
system.
it
was
that
combination
which
was
attacked
in
the
government
action
and
that
combination
had
never
been
passed
upon
before
or
sanctioned
before
by
any
court.
and
it
was
that
combination
of
policies
and
practices
which
was
held
to
constitute
monopolization
at
the
district
court
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
repeating
on
this
on
the
basis
of
that
combination
held
that
the
united
had
excluded
actual
and
potential
competition
and
restricted
a
free
market.
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
district
court
in
the
government
action
detailed
the
effects
that
united's
policies
and
practices
produced
on
shoe
manufacturers
and
not
on
only
shoe
machinery
manufacturers
that
were
also
set
forth,
but
on
shoe
manufacturers.
now,
in
our
brief
we
treat
on
the
law
with
the
target
area
argument
that
is
presented
by
united
in
463,
but
i
think
the
short
answer
to
this
whole
target
area
argument
is
found
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
the
united
action
and
the
government
action
as
to
precisely
what
the
effects
were
on
shoe
manufacturers
of
united's
exclusionary
policy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
extremely
difficult
to
imagine
anybody
who
could
be
more
directly
affected
by
a
monopoly
than
the
customer
who
must
deal
with
the
monopoly
into
the
monopolized
market.
now,
neither
court
below
found
the
decree
in
the
government
action
ambiguous.
they
both
found
it
to
hold
what
i
have
said
in
the
course
of
my
argument
to
your
honors
that
it
does
hold.
but
united
in
463
seeks
to
create
an
ambiguity
in
what
the
court
held
in
the
government
action
and
it
claims
that
the
court
in
the
government
action
did
not
hold
the
lease
only
policy
to
be
a
means
of
monopolization.
and
building
on
this
claim,
it
contrives
an
ambiguity.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
contrived
ambiguity,
it
claims
that
the
district
court
below
should
have
certified
the
question
of
what
the
government
decree
meant
to
the
district
court
of
massachusetts
and
united
now
claims
error
because
of
the
failure
of
the
district
court
below
to
do
so.
now
to
begin
with,
there
is
no
rule
or
practice
in
the
federal
system
whereby
treble-damage
courts
should
refer
to
decree
entering
courts
for
an
interpretation
of
decrees
entered
in
the
decree
entering
court.
the
treble-damage
court's
job
is
to
decide
the
case
before
it.
there
is
the
decree
in
black
and
white
and
this
decree
was
not
merely
the
decree
of
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
it
was
in
effect
the
decree
of
this
court
because
it
had
been
affirmed
by
this
court.
obviously,
every
treble-damage
court
passing
upon
a
decree
entered
in
another
court
has
the
task
of
asking
itself
what
does
this
decree
mean
and
it
arrives
at
an
interpretation.
if
it
is
wrong,
it
can
be
reversed
on
appeal.
there
is
no
need
for
running
back
and
forth
between
courts
and
i
can
conceive
of
no
greater
waste
of
judicial
time
and
judicial
manpower
in
such
a
rule
as
united
contends
for.
another
contrived
argument
advanced
by
united
here
is
that
the
lease
only
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
court
in
the
government
action.
again,
we
have
spelled
out
in
detail
the
complaint,
the
finding
and
so
on
in
the
court,
in
the
decision
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
government
action,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
charges
there
dismissed
related
to
other
vices
of
the
industry
in
which
united
was
involved
and
did
not
relate
to
the
shoe
machinery
industry
which
that
court
specifically
held
had
been
monopolized
by
united.
further,
united
would
escape
liability
here
by
the
so
called
passing
on.
now
this
passing
on
issue
was
a
subject
of
a
separate
trial
back
in
1959
or
1960,
four
days
of
trial.
it
was
decided
by
the
district
court
in
united's
favor.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
oh
thank
you
ralph.
i
do
mean
hanover's
favor.
i
am
--
hanover's
counsel
i
believe
in
the
case.
untied
says
however
that
the
measure
of
damages
that
was
before
judge
goodrich
in
the
passing
on
trial
was
a
different
measure
of
damages
from
what
hanover
presented
at
the
trial
and
that
is
just
not
so.
the
separate
trial
was
held
on
the
basis
of
a
stipulation
as
to
what
judge
goodrich
was
to
decide
and
that
stipulation
provide
that
it
should
be
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
the
trial
not
only
that
there
was
a
violation
of
law
but
that
the
excessive
cost
of
shoe
machinery
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
existed.
now
let
us
look
at
hanover's
complaint.
hanover's
complaint
alleged
the
two
types
of
injury
that
i
mentioned,
excessiveness
of
rentals
and
the
excessive
cost
of
machinery
by
being
denied
the
right
to
purchase.
and
i
was
interesting
to
read
--
interested
to
read
in
united's
main
brief
in
463
at
page
14
that
united
itself
set
forth
that
both
kinds
of
injury
were
alleged
in
hanover's
complaint.
united
suggests
that
the
primary
claim
below,
the
comparison
between
leasing
and
ownership
cost
was
first
advanced
at
the
trial.
it
must
have
been
a
stoop
of
memory
on
the
part
of
united's
counsel.
united
knew
this
in
the
very
beginning,
we
alleged
it
in
our
complaint.
copies
of
our
tabulations
in
the
course
of
discovery
have
been
delivered
to
united
long
before
the
trial
began.
but
really,
there
passing
on
argument
of
united
is
based
primarily
on
the
oil
java
cases
and
no
similarity
can
be
found
between
those
cases
and
the
hanover
situation.
unlike
the
oil
jobers
(ph)
cases
there
was
no
guaranteed
margin
here,
basically,
the
cases
could
not
be
the
same.
unlike
the
oil
jobbers,
hanover
did
not
buy
and
sell
machinery.
hanover
used
the
machinery.
it
was
a
consumer
so
to
speak
of
the
use
of
the
machinery
it
leased.
further
there
was
absolutely
no
relation
between
the
rather
infrequent
changes
in
united's
rents
and
royalties
and
the
very
frequent
changes
in
the
sales
prices
of
hanover
shoes.
actually,
as
one
analyzes
united's
argument
on
passing
on,
it
comes
down
to
this.
hanover
operated
at
a
profit
during
the
whole
period,
therefore
it
must
have
passed
on.
if
it
didn't
pass
on,
it
might
have
operated
at
a
loss.
so
we
have
a
new
rule
of
antitrust
law
that
the
treble-damage
plaintiff
who
despised
restraints
makes
a
profit,
may
not
recover
but
the
treble-damage
plaintiff
who
was
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
money
may
recover.
i
find
no
justification
in
statute
or
case
for
such
a
doctrine.
the
short
answer
of
this
whole
passing
on
was
the
one
that
judge
goodrich
gave
and
at
first
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
in
assessing
damages.
and
secondly
that
if
the
excess
cost
had
not
been
imposed
on
united,
hanover
would
have
more
money
to
use
whatever
it
wanted
to
use
it
for
in
its
business.
and
there
is
here
contrary
to
united's
contention,
no
wind
fall
to
hanover
rather
a
balancing
of
the
scales.
i
suspect
that
if
windfall
if
any
is
what
united
would
like
to
have
by
keeping
the
fruits
of
its
monopoly.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
i
haven't
thought
of
that.
may
i
have
a
moment
mr.
justice
white?
an
inconsistency
between
the
passing
on
--
yes
i
do,
because
with
respect
to
the
passing
on
they
adopt
the
general
rule
that
the
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
and
the
taxes
they
are
going
beyond
the
first
step
to
wit
a
point
of
exaction
of
excess
royalties.
i
see
that
inconsistency
in
intellectual
concept
so
to
speak.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
right,
the
order
of
oil
jobber
cases
did.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
now
if
we
have
in
fact
passed
on,
if
the
fact
situation
were
like
for
example
the
oil
jobber
cases,
if
for
example
incidentally
these
machine
cost
prepare
shoes
run
similar
item
in
a
sense
of
pair
but
let
us
assume
that
every
time
united
changed
its
rates
and
increased
it
$0.1
a
share,
we
--
because
of
that,
increased
our
sales
price
$0.1
a
share.
and
let
us
assume
further
as
was
the
case
in
the
oil
jobber
case
that
united
guaranteed
that
we
would
still
make
this
much
money
on
sales
of
shoes
as
we
had
if
they
did
not
increase
their
sales
prices.
with
such
a
set
of
facts,
i
would
say
hanover
will
be
in
no
position
to
recover,
thus
far
if
from
the
fact
situation
here.
now,
i
do
not
know
whether
i've
answered
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
united
further
would
deny
recovery
here
because
it
says
there
was
no
formal
demand
to
sell.
now
both
courts
below
considered
this
claim
of
a
lack
of
a
formal
demand
and
concluded
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
demand
would
be
vital
and
futile.
the
court
of
appeals
i
thought
i
phrased
it
fairly
well
and
i
have
been
paraphrasing
what
they
said,
i
cannot
remember
it
offhand.
they
said
that
a
demand
here
would
really
be
a
demand
of
that
of
a
monopoly
and
this
one
is
a
powerful
and
persistent
monopolist,
would
be
a
demand
that
a
monopolist
seized
monopolizing.
i
think
they
described
such
a
notion
as
ironic
any
contention
that
is
that
under
those
circumstances,
a
demand
should
be
required.
united
brings
in
a
very
interesting
notion
in
its
so
called
cost
of
capital,
claiming
that
cost
of
capital
first
and
first
claimers,
i
do
not
know
which
first
or
second,
they
have
two
claims.
one,
because
the
cost
of
capital
hanover
faced
--
would
face,
it
would
never
buy
the
machines.
secondly
that
in
determining
their
damages
the
cost
of
capital
should
be
determined
and
deducted
from
any
award.
the
cost
of
capital
is
solely
an
economic
concept
and
it
maybe
the
concept
to
be
cutting
us.
it
was
occasionally
in
the
course
of
this
not
too
short
trial,
a
bit
of
humor
would
get
in
to
the
case
and
i
remember
that
their
expert
cited
as
an
authority
to
this
cost
of
capital
approach
to
a
certain
document,
certain
book.
i
was
foolish
enough
to
read
the
book
and
that
incidentally
the
expert
hadn't
quite
precise
as
to
just
what
percentages
should
be
applied
to
hanover's
so
called
cost
of
capital.
when
i
read
the
book,
i
found
that
the
author
said
that
pen
economists
measured
the
cost
of
capital
of
ibm,
they
would
have
10
answers.
and
i
asked
him
if
he
relied
on
this
book
and
he
said
yes
and
i
asked
if
he
relied
on
that
and
he
said
“no,
the
authors
were
wrong
there”.
they
were
right
only
in
the
sense
that
it
is
an
economic
theory.
of
course
it
is.
it
is
a
theory
that
is
used
by
economists
as
a
guide
in
deciding
whether
a
certain
investment
might
or
might
not
be
worthwhile.
in
no
sense
is
it
cost?
in
no
accounting
sense
is
it
a
cost?
it
is
not
a
disbursement,
it's
not
an
item
of
an
expense
incurred
in
the
course
of
operation.
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
profit
and
loss
statement.
but
even
under
the
theory,
capital
can
be
of
two
kinds,
equity
and
borrow
and
the
cost
of
capital
that
is
being
talked
about
here
is
cost
of
equity
capital.
in
the
case
of
borrowings,
the
cost
of
capital
is
the
interest
rate
and
this
is
agreed
to
by
the
experts
below.
hanover
has
been
held
and
in
fact
had
a
surplus
of
equity,
had
surplus
of
even
of
current
assets,
but
hanover
for
the
purpose
of
its
calculations
assumed
it
would
borrow
the
money
so
that
its
business
will
otherwise
go
on
as
it
had
gone
in
fact.
and
during
the
period
of
the
so
called
supposed
acquisitions,
hanover
in
fact
paid
the
prime
rate
and
this
sounds
like
old
times.
the
prime
rate
then
was
1.5%
to
2%
and
hanover
deducted
it
from
its
calculations
pursuant
to
judge
harry's
direction,
his
direction
2.5%.
now
if
hanover
had
any
cost
of
capital
that
was
it
and
it's
fully
accounted
for
in
the
calculations.
hanover
had
no
other
cost
of
capital
and
certainly
no
cost
of
equity
capital.
both
courts
below
considered
this
cost
of
capital
theory.
both
rejected
it,
any
other
conclusion
i
submit
would
be
ridiculous.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
this
suggests
that
i
am
coming
to
the
end,
there
is
no
reason
and
this
is
our
basic
position
that
hanover
should
be
treated
differently
from
any
other
treble-damage
plaintiffs
who
relies
on
a
decree
in
a
prior
government
action
that
hanover
was
damaged
by
united's
monopolization
cannot
possibly
be
disputed.
the
district
court's
decision
held,
it
cost
hanover
$1,413,000
more
to
lease
the
machines
and
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
had
rented
it
in
free
market.
and
the
district
court
said
and
quite
accurately
and
it
is
one
of
the
short
answers
to
all
of
united's
contention,”by
this
monopolization
hanover
was
aimed
at
and
hit.”
we
submit
that
your
honors
please
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
on
the
points
set
forth
in
number
335.
we
submit
further
that
the
points
raised
by
united
in
463
are
not
worthy
of
this
court's
consideration.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
yes
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
oh
yes,
completely.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
in
full,
the
full
trebled
amount
and
united
gets
a
deduction
on
its
tax
return
for
whatever
recovery
it
pays.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
examples
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
just
a
few
moment
and
i
hope
will
not
consume
them
all
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
going
to
make
no
effort
whatever
to
reply
to
the
bits
and
pieces
of
testimony
and
to
the
truncated
version
of
the
colloquy
before
judge
wyzanski.
the
record
speaks
for
itself
and
the
answer
can
be
more
readily
be
found
and
more
clearly
stated
in
the
very
elaborate
and
careful
findings
of
judge
sheridan
in
the
court
below.
i
do
want
to
refer
to
one
thing.
mr.
carson's
separation
so
far
as
the
government
action
is
concerned
between
lease
only
and
the
leasing
provisions.
as
if
there
were
separate
and
distinct
things.
they
were
things
that
went
together,
operated
together
and
it
was
the
combination
of
them
that
caused
the
monopolization.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
plain,
ordinary
common
sense
that
if
united
had
a
leasing
practice
whereby
it
could
lease
machines,
with
all
of
these
exclusionary
provisions
where
at
the
same
time
said
to
the
shoe
manufacturer,
“you
may
buy
the
machines
if
you
want”,
the
exclusionary
practices
would
be
nothing.
a
manufacturer
if
get
out
from
shoe
manufacturer,
if
he
get
our
from
under
by
just
buying
the
machines.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
it
was
the
lease
only
that
made
the
exclusionary
practices
really
effective.
i
have
to
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
lease
only
was
not
condemned
as
to
me
to
do
violence
to
simple
logic.
just
a
little
sideline,
mr.
carson
said
we
weren't
damaged
by
any
of
these
practices.
well
what
happened
that
run
into
my
head.
take
this
free
service
supposedly,
a
service
without
a
separate
charge.
we
show
in
the
trial
below
that
the
portion
of
united
rentals
that
were
taken
care,
have
i
finished
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
--
by
taken
cared
of
by
the
service
charges
amounted
to
$239,000
when
hanover
bought
the
machines,
and
five
years
later
incurred
actual
cost
of
service
despite
the
great
raise
in
rates
paid,
the
service
cost
amounted
to
a
$118,000.
so
even
on
that,
they
were
substantially
damaged.
i
thank
your
honors
for
your
generosity
and
time.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
case
of
hanover,
a
manufacturer
of
men's
shoes
brought
against
the
defendant,
united
for
damages
occasioned
by
united's
monopolization
of
the
shoe
machinery
trade.
hanover
leased
from
united
all
of
the
machines
involved
in
this
case
at
least
which
is
needed
in
the
manufacture
of
its
shoes.
there
were
no
comp
--
machines,
comparable
in
quality
with
the
united's
machines
which
were
available
from
any
other
domestic
or
foreign
source.
the
district
court
undisturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
united's
monopoly
position
was
from
89%
to
100%
of
the
20
most
important
machines
which
accounted
for
80%
of
the
royalties
which
hanover
paid
united,
and
it's
monopoly
position
was
from
85%
to
100%
of
all
but
six
of
the
machines
and
there
were
a
total
of
58
which
hanover
rented
from
united.
now,
all
of
those
machine
types
were
available
to
hanover
from
united
solely
on
a
lease
only
basis.
in
1947,
the
government
brought
an
action
against
united
and
i
shall
refer
to
that
action
as
the
government
action.
in
that
action,
the
district
court
held
that
united's
lease
only
policy,
the
provisions
of
its
leases
and
related
sales
policies
or
related
policies
having
to
do
with
its
relations
with
its
customers
were
exclusionary
and
illegal.
and
it
held
on
the
basis
of
its
findings
that
united
had
monopolized
the
shoe
machinery
trade.
now,
in
the
course
of
this
argument
i
am
going
to
use
the
shorthand
phrase,
leasing
system
to
describe
the
leases
and
the
bundle
of
policies
which
were
condemned
by
the
district
court
in
the
government
action.
on
the
basis
of
its
decision,
the
court
in
the
government
action
enjoined
the
leasing
system
and
directed
that,
from
the
date
to
be
fixed,
united
should
offer
no
machine
of
those
involved
for
lease
unless
it
also
offered
it
for
sale.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
the
government's
action
as
your
honors
well
know
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision.
the
decree
in
the
government
action
was
offered
and
received
in
evidence
by
the
district
court
below.
the
district
court
below
in
arriving
at
its
findings
and
conclusions
relied
on
that
decree
on
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
court
in
the
government
action
and
also
an
additional
proof
of
monopolization
which
hanover
offered
at
the
trial.
with
respect
to
damages,
hanover
offered
two
kinds
of
proof.
it's
first
kind
of
proof
what
the
district
court
refers
to
as
a
primary
claim,
consisted
of
a
comparison
between
the
rentals
which
united
actually
--
i
mean,
which
hanover,
pardon
me,
actually
paid
to
united
and
what
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
had
owned
the
machines
and
met
the
necessary
ownership
cost,
that
was
one
method.
the
second
method
was
based
on
19
instances
which
we
found
in
the
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
government
action,
instances
where
united
had
reduced
its
rents
and
royalties
on
machines
when
it
was
faced
with
competition,
with
respect
to
those
machines
and
i
might
mention
though
that
a
matter
purely
of
interest
that
the
percentage
reductions
ranged
from
11%
to
82%
and
averaged
out
at
43%.
the
district
court
held
that
with
respect
to
that
evidence
which
was
tendered
to
show
excessiveness
in
the
rents
and
royalties
themselves,
the
plaintiff,
hanover
had
failed
to
prove
excessiveness.
united
in
its
briefs
consistently
asserts
that
its
rents
and
royalties
have
been
held
reasonable.
there
is
no
such
holding
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
or
by
the
district
court
in
the
government
action.
the
holding
was
that
hanover
failed
to
prove
excessiveness
which
is
somewhat
different.
the
district
court,
however,
in
this
action
found
that
under
hanover's
primary
proof,
the
comparison
of
leasing
with
ownership
cost,
hanover
had
demonstrated
that
it
had
been
damaged
in
the
sum
of
$1,413,000.
that
is
what
had
cost
hanover
to
lease
the
machines
over
and
above
what
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
have
had
the
opportunity
in
a
free
market
to
buy
the
machines.
on
united's
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
third
circuit,
that
court
affirmed
with
respect
to
all
claims,
all
questions
having
to
do
with
liability.
and
united's
appeal
to
that
court
presented
every
question
that's
involved
in
the
conditional
cross
petition
here.
it
did,
however,
order
a
new
trial,
limited
to
damages
on
two
grounds.
the
first
of
these
grounds
is
that
the
award
of
damages
should
be
reduced
by
the
so
called
tax
benefits,
tax
disadvantages
that
ownership
would
entail
to
it
as
i
understand
the
opinion
that
if
hanover
had
been
the
owner,
it
would
not
have
had
the
advantage,
it
did
have
as
lessee
in
that
as
lessee.
it
was
able
to
deduct
all
its
rents
and
royalties
on
its
tax
returns.
and
also
that
as
owner,
hanover
would
have
had
to
pay
capital
gains
taxes
on
any
machines
itself.
now
it's
strange
to
my
poor
simple
mind
as
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
with
respect
to
the
deduction
of
the
expenses.
it
loses
me
completely
with
respect
to
the
capital
gains
because
as
i
will
mention
in
a
moment
the
reason
is
that
hanover
must
be
assumed
to
have
had
a
choice
and
you
calculate
the
damages
as
they
would
have
been
calculated
if
hanover
had
a
choice,
but
assuming
hanover
had
choice,
how
hanover
in
deciding
to
buy
the
machine
could
tell
when
and
what
amount
it
would
have
a
capital
gain
completely
escapes
me.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
if
hanover
had
purchased
machines,
it
would
have
sold
them
before
the
end
of
their
useful
lives
or
that
if
it
did
sell
them,
it
would
have
sold
them
for
more
than
the
depreciated
value
on
the
books
of
hanover.
now
this
we
submit,
this
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
so
called
tax
advantages
that
hanover
enjoyed
under
the
leasing
system
is
error.
we
start
from
one
basic
fundamental
principle
that
there
is
no
law,
that
we
have
been
able
to
discover
and
no
basis
in
fact
in
this
case
why
hanover
should
be
treated
any
differently
from
any
other
treble-damage
plaintiff.
such
plaintiffs
always
are
permitted
to
recover
the
full
damage
sustained
by
them
without
regard
to
tax
consequences.
we
haven't
found
a
single
case
which
could
see
the
so
called
tax
consequences,
may
be
cover
the
excess.
the
excess
here
was
the
amount
by
which
the
leasing
cost
exceeded
what
would
have
been
the
ownership
cost.
our
calculations
as
such
are
not
challenged.
there
is
one
challenge
that
mr.
carson
makes
that
i
will
come
to,
but
the
courts
below
did
not
challenge
them.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
district
court
we
submit
was
correct
in
its
oppose
to
this
case
was
to
disregard
what
has
been
traditionally
the
basic
rule
of
damages
that
in
approaching
damages,
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
and
this
is
a
rule
that
has
been
recognized
constantly
over
the
years,
in
both
contracts
and
torts
cases.
now
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
right.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
it
was
first
enunciated
if
i
recall
rightly
by
justice
holmes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
it
means
that
the
damage
is
measured
at
the
time
of
the
impact
of
the
wrong.
what
happens
after
that
is
just
not
considered.
that
is
as
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
here
is
rather
than
intriguing.
they
begin
with
the
finding
below,
well
supported
by
the
evidence
that
if
hanover
had
had
the
opportunity,
it
would
have
bought
the
machines.
and
then
they
do
--
they
went
to
a
bit
of
vaticination.
they
say
now
if
hanover
had
been
free
to
choose,
what
happened?
it
would
like
every
other
businessman
have
weighed
the
two
courses
open
to
it,
leasing
and
owning.
and
that
business
has
been
generally
when
weighing
such
choices,
consider
not
merely
the
gross
but
the
net,
they
consider
the
tax
consequences
that
might
be
involved
in
either
choice.
and
accordingly,
since
businessmen
would
normally
consider
the
tax
consequences,
as
if
the
tax
consequences
looked
upon
by
businessmen
would
be
inherent
in
their
choice,
damages
should
be
calculated
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
decision
whether
to
buy
or
sell
by
looking
prospectively,
retrospectively,
prospectively
at
tax
consequences.
now
to
begin
with,
i
mentioned
the
court
of
appeals
and
united
has
mentioned
of
the
so
called
tax
(inaudible).
under
the
law,
they
are
non
existent.
all
expenses
of
leasing,
all
expenses
of
ownership
are
fully
deductible
on
taxpayer's
tax
returns.
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
aside
from
going
beyond
the
first
step,
the
error
inherent
in
this
choice
reasoning
of
theirs
is
their
assumption
that
the
elements
which
are
considered
by
businessmen
in
deciding
whether
or
not
they
will
take
a
certain
business
step
are
the
elements
that
must
be
considered
by
courts
in
deciding
or
rather
in
calculating
the
amount
of
the
damage
sustained
by
an
injured
plaintiff.
that
is
a
necessary
part
of
their
error.
and
even
this
talk
of
choice
to
my
again,
poor,
simple
mind
is
beyond
the
point.
hanover
had
no
choice.
hanover,
we
have
demonstrated,
was
compelled
by
monopolization
to
pay
out
more
money
for
the
operation
of
its
business
than
it
would
have
paid
would
not
--
would
have
paid
in
a
free
market
and
they
were
forced
to
pay
it
out
because
they
operated
in
a
monopolized
market.
if
in
fact
hanover
had
a
choice,
it
could
have
been
bought
or
leased,
we
will
have
no
claim.
that
would
be
nonexistent.
it
was
the
lack
of
choice
by
which
hanover
was
injured.
and
what
hanover
might
have
done
or
hanover
might
have
considered,
assuming
it
had
a
choice
or
would
any
other
businessman
might
or
might
not
have
considered,
we
submit
is
of
utmost
of
academic
interest
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
what
was
the
amount
of
the
damage
to
hanover.
now,
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
court
of
appeals
cited
no
authority,
non
exists
which
it
could
cite.
the
nearest
approach
to
an
authority
with
the
sort
of
reasoning
it
gives,
it
said,
it's
just
as
realistic
to
deduct
taxes
as
it
was
for
the
district
court
to
require
that
in
calculating
the
damages,
the
servicing
expenses
on
the
machines
should
be
deducted.
it
is
an
equation
that
i
am
afraid
escapes
me.
it
is
a
new
part
of
my
talking
criminal
matters
but
i
am
addressing
myself
to
the
court
of
appeals'
comment.
servicing
expenses
quite
obviously
of
expenses
of
operation
that
are
met
and
paid
before
whenever
reaches
net
profit.
taxes
have
nothing
to
do
as
such
with
the
operation
of
a
business.
they
are
a
sharing
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
with
the
sovereign
of
what
the
taxpayer
has
left
after
he
has
arrived
at
his
net
profit.
now
in
no
sense
as
united
would
suggest
any
very
noble
or
unique
case.
it's
not
the
first
time
that
plaintiffs
in
antitrust
actions
have
been
damaged
by
being
forced
to
incur
greater
cost
because
of
an
antitrust
violation
than
they
would
have
incurred
absent
the
violation
and
it
very
likely
that
in
every
such
case,
the
injured
plaintiffs
deducted
those
excess
costs
on
their
tax
returns
because
there
are
operations
of
a
business,
but
it
was
never
been
suggested
that
i
can
find
that
such
plaintiffs
should
not
recover
the
full
amount
of
the
excess
cost
or
that
the
excess
cost
should
have
been
deducted
from
them
the
taxes
they
saved
because
they
deducted
the
excess
cost
on
their
tax
returns.
this
is
what
is
novel.
there
is
no
case
in
the
books
which
even
suggests
it.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honors.
the
damage
sustained
by
it,
if
i
may
paraphrase
the
statute,
was
the
full
excess
extracted
from
hanover
by
united
through
its
monopolization.
now,
one
purpose
of
damages
is
to
put
the
parties
back
in
the
positions
they
would
have
occupied
if
there
had
never
been
a
violation.
in
the
examples
in
our
briefs,
we
have
demonstrated
that
by
disregarding
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
forgetting
this
choice
business
and
tax
business,
the
parties
are
put
back
where
they
were.
but
by
taking
the
court
of
appeals
rule
and
applying
it,
using
a
50%
assumed
tax
rate,
the
result
is
that
the
united,
the
monopolizer,
the
violator
is
left
with
half
of
the
unlawful
exaction
and
the
victim,
hanover
is
out
of
pocket
the
same
amount
of
money.
we
submit
that
an
approach
which
leaves
the
wrong
doer
with
his
illegal
games
and
the
victim
out
of
profit
could
not
possibly
come
under
the
heading
of
a
symbol
on
the
top
of
the
entrance
to
this
courthouse.
now
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
a
new
trial
was
that
the
damage
period
should
be
cut
almost
halfway
through
its
full
statutory
distance
because
of
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
decision
of
this
court
on
june
10,
1946,
an
american
tobacco
case
brought
about
a
change
in
the
law
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
would
cut
off
hanover's
damages
at
that
point.
united
goes
much
further
in
its
brief.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
total
statutory
period
with
the
total
statutes
was
from
july
1,
1939
to
june
1955.
united
in
its
number
463,
looks
upon
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
defense
but
as
a
secondary
position,
united's
primary
position
is
that
the
decree
in
the
government
action
can
be
given
no
retroactive
effect
whatsoever.
it
must
be
considered
solely,
prospectively
according
to
the
united,
there
should
be
no
award
here
but
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
award
at
least
begins
the
damage
period
at
june
10,
1946.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
for
a
moment
first
to
united's
position,
we
can
find
no
authority,
no
principle,
and
the
whole
history
of
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act,
legislative
history,
cases
which
supports
united's
position
that
a
decree
in
a
government
action
shall
be
looked
upon
prospectively
only.
and
here
again,
we
submit
that
hanover
should
not
be
treated
any
differently
from
the
way
any
other
antitrust
plaintiff
is
treated,
as
the
main
antitrust
plaintiff
who
relies
on
a
decree
in
a
prior
government
case.
all
such
government
decrees
and
again,
i
apologize
for
stressing
premier
concepts,
are
based
on
the
findings
of
the
court
in
the
government
case
and
an
adjudication
of
a
violation
of
the
law
in
the
past
or
there
would
be
no
basis
for
the
decree.
and
then
the
decree
operates
prospectively
because
it
can't
operate
any
other
way
as
to
action.
it
wipes
out
the
illegal
action
or
it
wipes
out
the
conduct,
the
illegal
conduct
in
the
future,
but
it
cannot
change
the
illegal
conduct
that
it
found
to
have
existed
in
the
past.
united's
proposed
rule
is
very
interesting
one
so
far
as
further
damage
and
plaintiffs
are
concerned
and
treble-damage
plaintiffs
have
a
hard
enough
time
as
it
is
proving
their
cases.
but
per
united's
rule,
there
would
never
be
an
occasion
on
the
statutory
provision
that
the
decree
in
the
government
action
is
prima
facie
evidence
would
ever
be
possible
at
all,
because
if
decrees
operate
prospectively,
they
would
contain
no
adjudication
as
to
the
past.
now
the
fact
is
that
the
evidence
of
a
government
action
covers
many
years
going
back
to
before
the
1920's
if
i
remember
rightly.
the
findings
on
that
case
were
based
on
that
evidence
and
in
this
court's
per
curiam
enforced
affirmance,
we
find
a
very
pertinent
language
that
the
finding
of
that
case
to
government
action
now,
that
the
findings
are
justified
by
the
evidence
and
support
the
decree
and
that
is
the
decree
on
which
hanover
is
relying.
now
neither
in
that
decree
itself
or
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
of
massachusetts,
or
in
this
courts
affirmance,
is
there
any
suggestion
that
there
is
a
cut
off
at
any
particular
point?
nowhere
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
below
is
there
any
suggestion
of
a
cut
off.
there,
the
government
decree
or
the
decree
in
the
government
action,
the
findings,
the
conclusions
of
the
court
in
that
action
and
the
additional
evidence
introduced
by
hanover
covered
the
whole
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations
as
told.
the
court
of
appeals
holds
however,
now
this
is
fine,
however
while
everything
united
did
after
june
10,
1946
was
precisely
the
same
as
united
did
prior
to
june
10,
1946.
everything
united
did
after
that
date
is
unlawful
and
damages
may
be
recovered
for
it
and
everything
it
did
prior
to
that
date
was
lawful
and
there
may
be
no
damages.
now,
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
that
there
is
no
prior
case,
no
prior
rule
of
law
that
was
overruled
by
american
tobacco
or
by
alcoa.
and
both
of
those
decisions
as
we
have
pointed
out
relied
on
decisions
pre-dating
united's
adoption
of
the
leasing
system
condemned
in
the
government
action
and
they
adopted
that
in
1922.
both
justice
--
judge
hand
and
this
court
relied
on
decisions
predating
1922.
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
american
tobacco
or
alcoa
is
that
they
were
new
developments
made,
new
interpretations,
but
of
what?
of
a
statute
that
goes
back
to
1890
and
the
principles
that
have
been
established
many
years
before,
and
that
happens
constantly
in
the
antitrust
field.
there's
nothing
new
about
it,
nothing
noble
about
it.
it
does
not
mean
and
it
never
has
meant
that
such
nuances
as
they
grow
bring
about
decrees
which
have
only
prospective
effect
and
bar
any
treble-damage
action.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
relation
between
the
two.
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
james
v.
hayes
those
are
doctrines
which
generally
had
to
do
with
the
--
and
they
all
have
to
do
i
believe
with
the
enforcement
of
criminal
statutes
and
the
protection
of
constitutional
rights
either
by
providing
that
something
should
have
been
done
that
wasn't
done
or
prohibiting
something
that
was
done
that
should
not
have
been
done.
here,
we
have
a
statute
and
there
is
nothing
new,
it
has
been
upheld
time
and
time
again,
no
question
about
its
constitutionality.
it's
been
interpreted
time
and
time
again.
it
has
been
developed
time
and
time
again
by
the
courts.
if
there
were
a
real
overruling
provision
here,
i
could
see
the
relevance
of
the
criminal
cases
or
if
there
were
some
constitutional
provision
involved
here,
i
could
see
the
relevance.
otherwise
i
am
afraid
the
relevance
escapes
me.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
a
point
that
united
urges
in
its
brief.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
no
it
does
not.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
we
are
not
suing
on
the
basis
of
a
refusal
to
sell
which
is
the
way
to
get
back
to
1912.
our
suit
here
is
for
damages
due
to
monopolization.
that
monopolization
is
continuous
and
as
the
courts
below
had
found
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
every
single
time,
united
exacts
from
hanover
a
rent
and
royalty
payment
which
enables
to
exact
because
of
its
violation
of
the
law,
there
is
a
new
cause
of
action.
hanover
here
is
seeking
only
for
those
costs
to
which
it
was
exposed
by
the
monopolization
during
the
statutory
period.
it
seeks
nothing
for
what
--
for
the
costs
that
were
imposed
upon
it
prior
to
the
statutory
period.
so
i
think
this
whole
argument
about
1912
based
on
a
refusal
to
sell
which
is
not
the
basis
of
our
action,
but
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
due
to
monopolization
just
has
no
merit.
so
little
merit
that
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
even
consider,
but
that
is
my
own
personal
opinion.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
connection
between
the
two
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
stewart
very
specifically.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
there
was
a
conditional
cross
petition
mr.
justice
white.
we
petitioned
on
the
basis
of
the
two
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
for
a
new
tria,l
that
mr.
carson
filed
a
cross-petition.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
that
is
right.
335
is
hanover's
petition.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
463
is
the
cross-petition
filed
by
mr.
carson.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes,
in
its
last
point
in
its
brief
to
the
very
end.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
every
single
point
urged
in
the
cross-petition
having
to
do
with
liability
was
rejected
by
both
courts
below
and
the
tax
points
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on
was
neither
briefed
nor
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
any
other
court.
now
the
supposed
change
in
the
law
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
how
was
what
decided?
mr.
james
v.
hayes
the
court
went
off
on
its
own
and
invented
or
designed
or
devised
this
rule
of
damages.
what
mr.
carson
had
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
same
position
he
primarily
takes
here
that
the
government
decree,
the
decree
in
the
government
action
had
only
prospective
effect
and
no
retroactive
effect.
that
argument
was
rejected
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
came
up
with
this,
what
i
submit
is
a
new
and
unsound
rule
of
damages
with
respect
to
taxes
--
pardon
me
not
taxes,
with
respect
to
retroactivity,
this
cutting
off
on
june
10,
1946.
if
i
said
taxes,
i
misspoke.
i
meant
the
retroactivity
of
june
10,
1940
--
to
june
10,
1946.
the
supposed
change
of
law
that
ought
to
take
in
place
on
june
10,
1946,
cane
be
phrased
very
simply.
the
law
had
been
as
a
mere
sized
on
exerted
power,
the
actions
of
predatory
practices
does
not
constitute
an
antitrust
violation.
now
if
one
looks
at
the
statute
one
finds
not
a
word
about
predatory
practices.
the
statute
speaks
about
monopolizing
commerce,
about
restraints
on
competition,
the
statute
is
aimed
at
developing
and
maintaining
a
free
market
and
the
statute
doesn't
have
any
distinction
between
polite
restraints
and
impolite
restraints,
between
gentlemanly
exclusions
from
the
market
or
ungentlemanly
exclusions
from
the
market,
but
let
us
assume
the
principle.
let
us
assume
it
is
still
the
law
that
mid-size,
un-exerted
power
do
not
constitute
a
violation.
the
trouble
with
the
principle
is
that
it
doesn't
fit
united.
there
is
no
question
that
united
have
the
size
and
the
power
with
its
tremendous
monopolistic
position
in
the
shoe
machinery
trade
particularly
the
machines
that
hanover
had
to
lease
from
it.
but
through
its
leasing
system,
which
was
condemned
in
the
government
action,
it
used
that
very
power
and
monopolistic
position
to
preserve
that
very
power
and
position
to
the
very
means
by
which
it
practically
married
the
shoe
manufacturers
to
its
monopoly,
maintaining
the
shoe
manufacturers
as
the
courts
below
has
said
as
a
captive
market
through
its
exclusion
of
competition
one
can
hardly
say
its
power
was
un-exerted,
one
certainly
cannot
deny
its
size.
the
very
success
it
met
over
the
years
by
these
exclusionary
practices
proves
that
its
maintenance
of
its
monopoly
position
is
and
its
ultimate
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
exclusionary
practices
condemned
in
the
government
action.
that
was
just
no
need
here
in
this
market
for
united
to
avoid
competition
by,
if
i
may
use
a
word
that
i
found
in
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
by
such
a
crafts
method
as
price
cutting.
it's
method
was
exclusionary.
its
method
as
the
courts
below
held
as
the
district
court
in
the
government
action
held
excluded
actual
and
potential
competition.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
basis
at
all
for
the
court
of
appeals
taking
it
up
on
itself
to
split
the
damage
period
practically
half
way
through.
we
submit
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
on
the
second
ground
of
our
petition
in
335.
now
something
that
must
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
claims
of
no
retroactivity
whether
one
considers
united's
claims
in
463
or
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
for
the
three
prior
cases
against
united.
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
united
claimed
that
it
was
resting
on
a
unique
record
of
res
judicata.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
thank
you
your
honor.
[recess]
mr.
james
v.
hayes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
again
may
it
please
the
court.
at
recess,
i
began
to
mention
that
in
the
district
court
below,
united
asserted
that
it
was
resting
on
a
unique
record
of
res
judicata
with
respect
to
the
three
prior
cases.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
on
the
oral
argument
on
the
appeal
from
the
government
action
before
this
court,
united's
counsel,
then
counsel
not
mr.
carson,
was
expressly
asked
if
he
considered
the
three
prior
cases
res
judicata
and
answered
with
a
flat
no.
united
also
claims
that
its
lease
only
policy
was
not
condemned
in
the
government
action,
and
here
again
on
that
same
appeal
on
the
government
action
but
in
the
briefs,
united's
counsel
described
the
lease
only
policy
as
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
basic
vice
in
the
system.
but
aside
from
all
that,
united
really
claims
that
the
three
prior
actions
approved
its
leasing
policy.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
this
court's
time
detailing
it,
an
analysis
of
those
cases
and
specifically
what
each
one
of
them
held
and
i
make
the
flat
statement
that
what
was
condemned
in
the
government
action
had
never
been
presented
in
this
court
before
and
accordingly
had
not
been
passed
on.
in
1922,
after
the
decision
in
the
clayton
act
case
which
throughout
all
of
the
tying
provisions
in
united's
leases,
united
adopted
the
forms
of
leases
and
leasing
policy
which
i
call
a
leasing
system
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
government
case
and
over
the
years,
it
added
some
additional
policies
which
are
also
part
of
that
leasing
system.
it
was
that
combination
which
was
attacked
in
the
government
action
and
that
combination
had
never
been
passed
upon
before
or
sanctioned
before
by
any
court.
and
it
was
that
combination
of
policies
and
practices
which
was
held
to
constitute
monopolization
at
the
district
court
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
repeating
on
this
on
the
basis
of
that
combination
held
that
the
united
had
excluded
actual
and
potential
competition
and
restricted
a
free
market.
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
district
court
in
the
government
action
detailed
the
effects
that
united's
policies
and
practices
produced
on
shoe
manufacturers
and
not
on
only
shoe
machinery
manufacturers
that
were
also
set
forth,
but
on
shoe
manufacturers.
now,
in
our
brief
we
treat
on
the
law
with
the
target
area
argument
that
is
presented
by
united
in
463,
but
i
think
the
short
answer
to
this
whole
target
area
argument
is
found
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
the
united
action
and
the
government
action
as
to
precisely
what
the
effects
were
on
shoe
manufacturers
of
united's
exclusionary
policy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
extremely
difficult
to
imagine
anybody
who
could
be
more
directly
affected
by
a
monopoly
than
the
customer
who
must
deal
with
the
monopoly
into
the
monopolized
market.
now,
neither
court
below
found
the
decree
in
the
government
action
ambiguous.
they
both
found
it
to
hold
what
i
have
said
in
the
course
of
my
argument
to
your
honors
that
it
does
hold.
but
united
in
463
seeks
to
create
an
ambiguity
in
what
the
court
held
in
the
government
action
and
it
claims
that
the
court
in
the
government
action
did
not
hold
the
lease
only
policy
to
be
a
means
of
monopolization.
and
building
on
this
claim,
it
contrives
an
ambiguity.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
contrived
ambiguity,
it
claims
that
the
district
court
below
should
have
certified
the
question
of
what
the
government
decree
meant
to
the
district
court
of
massachusetts
and
united
now
claims
error
because
of
the
failure
of
the
district
court
below
to
do
so.
now
to
begin
with,
there
is
no
rule
or
practice
in
the
federal
system
whereby
treble-damage
courts
should
refer
to
decree
entering
courts
for
an
interpretation
of
decrees
entered
in
the
decree
entering
court.
the
treble-damage
court's
job
is
to
decide
the
case
before
it.
there
is
the
decree
in
black
and
white
and
this
decree
was
not
merely
the
decree
of
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
it
was
in
effect
the
decree
of
this
court
because
it
had
been
affirmed
by
this
court.
obviously,
every
treble-damage
court
passing
upon
a
decree
entered
in
another
court
has
the
task
of
asking
itself
what
does
this
decree
mean
and
it
arrives
at
an
interpretation.
if
it
is
wrong,
it
can
be
reversed
on
appeal.
there
is
no
need
for
running
back
and
forth
between
courts
and
i
can
conceive
of
no
greater
waste
of
judicial
time
and
judicial
manpower
in
such
a
rule
as
united
contends
for.
another
contrived
argument
advanced
by
united
here
is
that
the
lease
only
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
court
in
the
government
action.
again,
we
have
spelled
out
in
detail
the
complaint,
the
finding
and
so
on
in
the
court,
in
the
decision
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
government
action,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
charges
there
dismissed
related
to
other
vices
of
the
industry
in
which
united
was
involved
and
did
not
relate
to
the
shoe
machinery
industry
which
that
court
specifically
held
had
been
monopolized
by
united.
further,
united
would
escape
liability
here
by
the
so
called
passing
on.
now
this
passing
on
issue
was
a
subject
of
a
separate
trial
back
in
1959
or
1960,
four
days
of
trial.
it
was
decided
by
the
district
court
in
united's
favor.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
oh
thank
you
ralph.
i
do
mean
hanover's
favor.
i
am
--
hanover's
counsel
i
believe
in
the
case.
untied
says
however
that
the
measure
of
damages
that
was
before
judge
goodrich
in
the
passing
on
trial
was
a
different
measure
of
damages
from
what
hanover
presented
at
the
trial
and
that
is
just
not
so.
the
separate
trial
was
held
on
the
basis
of
a
stipulation
as
to
what
judge
goodrich
was
to
decide
and
that
stipulation
provide
that
it
should
be
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
the
trial
not
only
that
there
was
a
violation
of
law
but
that
the
excessive
cost
of
shoe
machinery
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
existed.
now
let
us
look
at
hanover's
complaint.
hanover's
complaint
alleged
the
two
types
of
injury
that
i
mentioned,
excessiveness
of
rentals
and
the
excessive
cost
of
machinery
by
being
denied
the
right
to
purchase.
and
i
was
interesting
to
read
--
interested
to
read
in
united's
main
brief
in
463
at
page
14
that
united
itself
set
forth
that
both
kinds
of
injury
were
alleged
in
hanover's
complaint.
united
suggests
that
the
primary
claim
below,
the
comparison
between
leasing
and
ownership
cost
was
first
advanced
at
the
trial.
it
must
have
been
a
stoop
of
memory
on
the
part
of
united's
counsel.
united
knew
this
in
the
very
beginning,
we
alleged
it
in
our
complaint.
copies
of
our
tabulations
in
the
course
of
discovery
have
been
delivered
to
united
long
before
the
trial
began.
but
really,
there
passing
on
argument
of
united
is
based
primarily
on
the
oil
java
cases
and
no
similarity
can
be
found
between
those
cases
and
the
hanover
situation.
unlike
the
oil
jobers
(ph)
cases
there
was
no
guaranteed
margin
here,
basically,
the
cases
could
not
be
the
same.
unlike
the
oil
jobbers,
hanover
did
not
buy
and
sell
machinery.
hanover
used
the
machinery.
it
was
a
consumer
so
to
speak
of
the
use
of
the
machinery
it
leased.
further
there
was
absolutely
no
relation
between
the
rather
infrequent
changes
in
united's
rents
and
royalties
and
the
very
frequent
changes
in
the
sales
prices
of
hanover
shoes.
actually,
as
one
analyzes
united's
argument
on
passing
on,
it
comes
down
to
this.
hanover
operated
at
a
profit
during
the
whole
period,
therefore
it
must
have
passed
on.
if
it
didn't
pass
on,
it
might
have
operated
at
a
loss.
so
we
have
a
new
rule
of
antitrust
law
that
the
treble-damage
plaintiff
who
despised
restraints
makes
a
profit,
may
not
recover
but
the
treble-damage
plaintiff
who
was
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
money
may
recover.
i
find
no
justification
in
statute
or
case
for
such
a
doctrine.
the
short
answer
of
this
whole
passing
on
was
the
one
that
judge
goodrich
gave
and
at
first
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
in
assessing
damages.
and
secondly
that
if
the
excess
cost
had
not
been
imposed
on
united,
hanover
would
have
more
money
to
use
whatever
it
wanted
to
use
it
for
in
its
business.
and
there
is
here
contrary
to
united's
contention,
no
wind
fall
to
hanover
rather
a
balancing
of
the
scales.
i
suspect
that
if
windfall
if
any
is
what
united
would
like
to
have
by
keeping
the
fruits
of
its
monopoly.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
i
haven't
thought
of
that.
may
i
have
a
moment
mr.
justice
white?
an
inconsistency
between
the
passing
on
--
yes
i
do,
because
with
respect
to
the
passing
on
they
adopt
the
general
rule
that
the
courts
do
not
go
beyond
the
first
step
and
the
taxes
they
are
going
beyond
the
first
step
to
wit
a
point
of
exaction
of
excess
royalties.
i
see
that
inconsistency
in
intellectual
concept
so
to
speak.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
right,
the
order
of
oil
jobber
cases
did.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
now
if
we
have
in
fact
passed
on,
if
the
fact
situation
were
like
for
example
the
oil
jobber
cases,
if
for
example
incidentally
these
machine
cost
prepare
shoes
run
similar
item
in
a
sense
of
pair
but
let
us
assume
that
every
time
united
changed
its
rates
and
increased
it
$0.1
a
share,
we
--
because
of
that,
increased
our
sales
price
$0.1
a
share.
and
let
us
assume
further
as
was
the
case
in
the
oil
jobber
case
that
united
guaranteed
that
we
would
still
make
this
much
money
on
sales
of
shoes
as
we
had
if
they
did
not
increase
their
sales
prices.
with
such
a
set
of
facts,
i
would
say
hanover
will
be
in
no
position
to
recover,
thus
far
if
from
the
fact
situation
here.
now,
i
do
not
know
whether
i've
answered
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
united
further
would
deny
recovery
here
because
it
says
there
was
no
formal
demand
to
sell.
now
both
courts
below
considered
this
claim
of
a
lack
of
a
formal
demand
and
concluded
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
demand
would
be
vital
and
futile.
the
court
of
appeals
i
thought
i
phrased
it
fairly
well
and
i
have
been
paraphrasing
what
they
said,
i
cannot
remember
it
offhand.
they
said
that
a
demand
here
would
really
be
a
demand
of
that
of
a
monopoly
and
this
one
is
a
powerful
and
persistent
monopolist,
would
be
a
demand
that
a
monopolist
seized
monopolizing.
i
think
they
described
such
a
notion
as
ironic
any
contention
that
is
that
under
those
circumstances,
a
demand
should
be
required.
united
brings
in
a
very
interesting
notion
in
its
so
called
cost
of
capital,
claiming
that
cost
of
capital
first
and
first
claimers,
i
do
not
know
which
first
or
second,
they
have
two
claims.
one,
because
the
cost
of
capital
hanover
faced
--
would
face,
it
would
never
buy
the
machines.
secondly
that
in
determining
their
damages
the
cost
of
capital
should
be
determined
and
deducted
from
any
award.
the
cost
of
capital
is
solely
an
economic
concept
and
it
maybe
the
concept
to
be
cutting
us.
it
was
occasionally
in
the
course
of
this
not
too
short
trial,
a
bit
of
humor
would
get
in
to
the
case
and
i
remember
that
their
expert
cited
as
an
authority
to
this
cost
of
capital
approach
to
a
certain
document,
certain
book.
i
was
foolish
enough
to
read
the
book
and
that
incidentally
the
expert
hadn't
quite
precise
as
to
just
what
percentages
should
be
applied
to
hanover's
so
called
cost
of
capital.
when
i
read
the
book,
i
found
that
the
author
said
that
pen
economists
measured
the
cost
of
capital
of
ibm,
they
would
have
10
answers.
and
i
asked
him
if
he
relied
on
this
book
and
he
said
yes
and
i
asked
if
he
relied
on
that
and
he
said
“no,
the
authors
were
wrong
there”.
they
were
right
only
in
the
sense
that
it
is
an
economic
theory.
of
course
it
is.
it
is
a
theory
that
is
used
by
economists
as
a
guide
in
deciding
whether
a
certain
investment
might
or
might
not
be
worthwhile.
in
no
sense
is
it
cost?
in
no
accounting
sense
is
it
a
cost?
it
is
not
a
disbursement,
it's
not
an
item
of
an
expense
incurred
in
the
course
of
operation.
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
profit
and
loss
statement.
but
even
under
the
theory,
capital
can
be
of
two
kinds,
equity
and
borrow
and
the
cost
of
capital
that
is
being
talked
about
here
is
cost
of
equity
capital.
in
the
case
of
borrowings,
the
cost
of
capital
is
the
interest
rate
and
this
is
agreed
to
by
the
experts
below.
hanover
has
been
held
and
in
fact
had
a
surplus
of
equity,
had
surplus
of
even
of
current
assets,
but
hanover
for
the
purpose
of
its
calculations
assumed
it
would
borrow
the
money
so
that
its
business
will
otherwise
go
on
as
it
had
gone
in
fact.
and
during
the
period
of
the
so
called
supposed
acquisitions,
hanover
in
fact
paid
the
prime
rate
and
this
sounds
like
old
times.
the
prime
rate
then
was
1.5%
to
2%
and
hanover
deducted
it
from
its
calculations
pursuant
to
judge
harry's
direction,
his
direction
2.5%.
now
if
hanover
had
any
cost
of
capital
that
was
it
and
it's
fully
accounted
for
in
the
calculations.
hanover
had
no
other
cost
of
capital
and
certainly
no
cost
of
equity
capital.
both
courts
below
considered
this
cost
of
capital
theory.
both
rejected
it,
any
other
conclusion
i
submit
would
be
ridiculous.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
this
suggests
that
i
am
coming
to
the
end,
there
is
no
reason
and
this
is
our
basic
position
that
hanover
should
be
treated
differently
from
any
other
treble-damage
plaintiffs
who
relies
on
a
decree
in
a
prior
government
action
that
hanover
was
damaged
by
united's
monopolization
cannot
possibly
be
disputed.
the
district
court's
decision
held,
it
cost
hanover
$1,413,000
more
to
lease
the
machines
and
it
would
have
cost
hanover
if
it
had
rented
it
in
free
market.
and
the
district
court
said
and
quite
accurately
and
it
is
one
of
the
short
answers
to
all
of
united's
contention,”by
this
monopolization
hanover
was
aimed
at
and
hit.”
we
submit
that
your
honors
please
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
on
the
points
set
forth
in
number
335.
we
submit
further
that
the
points
raised
by
united
in
463
are
not
worthy
of
this
court's
consideration.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
yes
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
yes.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
oh
yes,
completely.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
in
full,
the
full
trebled
amount
and
united
gets
a
deduction
on
its
tax
return
for
whatever
recovery
it
pays.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
examples
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
james
v.
hayes
just
a
few
moment
and
i
hope
will
not
consume
them
all
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
going
to
make
no
effort
whatever
to
reply
to
the
bits
and
pieces
of
testimony
and
to
the
truncated
version
of
the
colloquy
before
judge
wyzanski.
the
record
speaks
for
itself
and
the
answer
can
be
more
readily
be
found
and
more
clearly
stated
in
the
very
elaborate
and
careful
findings
of
judge
sheridan
in
the
court
below.
i
do
want
to
refer
to
one
thing.
mr.
carson's
separation
so
far
as
the
government
action
is
concerned
between
lease
only
and
the
leasing
provisions.
as
if
there
were
separate
and
distinct
things.
they
were
things
that
went
together,
operated
together
and
it
was
the
combination
of
them
that
caused
the
monopolization.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
plain,
ordinary
common
sense
that
if
united
had
a
leasing
practice
whereby
it
could
lease
machines,
with
all
of
these
exclusionary
provisions
where
at
the
same
time
said
to
the
shoe
manufacturer,
“you
may
buy
the
machines
if
you
want”,
the
exclusionary
practices
would
be
nothing.
a
manufacturer
if
get
out
from
shoe
manufacturer,
if
he
get
our
from
under
by
just
buying
the
machines.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
it
was
the
lease
only
that
made
the
exclusionary
practices
really
effective.
i
have
to
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
lease
only
was
not
condemned
as
to
me
to
do
violence
to
simple
logic.
just
a
little
sideline,
mr.
carson
said
we
weren't
damaged
by
any
of
these
practices.
well
what
happened
that
run
into
my
head.
take
this
free
service
supposedly,
a
service
without
a
separate
charge.
we
show
in
the
trial
below
that
the
portion
of
united
rentals
that
were
taken
care,
have
i
finished
--
mr.
james
v.
hayes
--
by
taken
cared
of
by
the
service
charges
amounted
to
$239,000
when
hanover
bought
the
machines,
and
five
years
later
incurred
actual
cost
of
service
despite
the
great
raise
in
rates
paid,
the
service
cost
amounted
to
a
$118,000.
so
even
on
that,
they
were
substantially
damaged.
i
thank
your
honors
for
your
generosity
and
time.
