justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
a
cross-petition
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
to
sets
of
brief
here,
that
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
cross-petitioner
contend
that
the
suit
wholly
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hayes,
do
you
see
any
essential
inconsistency
between
the
court
of
appeals
during
what
it
did
with
respect
to
taxes
and
yet
rejecting
to
pass
on
to
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
well
argue
that
if
they
are
going
to
get
down
to
the
actual
out
of
pocket
cost
in
the
taxing,
they
could
well
get
the
same
thing
on
the
passing
on.
if
you
actually
passed
on,
let
us
assume
you
actually
passed
on
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
say
you
actually
passed
on
this
remedies
to
your
customer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
perhaps
you
are
not
losing
any
money
at
all
and
yet
the
court
permitted
you
to
--
permits
you
to
recover
in
spite
of
you
having
you
passed
it
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
hanover's
recovery
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
interrupt
just
a
moment
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
record
answer
the
question
of
whether
hanover
would
have
been
in
better
shape
if
the
lease
charges
had
been
lower?
they
may
have
passed
it
on
--
they
may
have
passed
it
on
but--
