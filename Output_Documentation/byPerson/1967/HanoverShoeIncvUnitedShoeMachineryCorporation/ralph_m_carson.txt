mr.
ralph
m.
carson
hanover's
favor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
mean
hanover's
favor?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
united
shoe
machinery
corporation,
appellant
in
number
463,
appellee
in
number
335,
i
should
like
to
present
the
case
differently
from
the
order
of
points
and
the
detailed
analysis
that
your
honors
will
see
in
the
brief
in
the
form
of
a
narration
of
what
happened
in
the
relations
between
the
parties
in
order
that
you
may
see
this
points
developed
as
we
go
along.
first
however,
i
should
like
while
the
statements
are
fresh
in
your
honors
mind
to
emphasize
two
points,
indeed
concessions,
that
mr.
hayes
has
made
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
the
first
statement
to
me
remarkable
and
i
wrote
it
down;
we
are
not
suing
on
the
basis
of
refusal
to
sell.
he
goes
on
to
say,
“we
are
suing
for
damage
due
for
monopolization.”
but
what
i
ask
your
honors
is
the
monopolization
accept
inability
to
buy
and
how
are
the
damages
computed
except
by
comparing
so
called
ownership
costs
with
so
called
lease
costs.
why
then
does
hanover
say
it
is
not
suing
for
refusal
to
sell
because
the
courts
below
held
a
finding
that
is
not
contested
that
there
was
no
demand?
now
the
second
interesting
point
which
mr.
hayes
made
which
is
basic
to
his
argument
is
the
point
that
the
tax
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
because
it
charges
hanover
with
taxes
or
the
effect
of
income
taxes
on
the
judgment
of
the
damages
it
has
proved.
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
that
mr.
hayes
argued
that
that
is
wrong,
that
the
court
of
appeals
wrongly
pursued
the
theory
of
hanover
having
a
choice,
the
choices
of
fiction,
and
that
since
it
had
no
choice,
and
because
of
inability
to
buy,
hanover
could
not
be
charged
with
income
tax
savings
in
the
course
of
the
assumed
purchased
operation
or
put
it
in
the
words
of
hanover's
last
brief
in
number
335
the
blue
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
in
espousing
in
a
fiction
of
choice
was
espousing
a
self
destructive
argument
and
one
that
automatically
abolished
the
possibility
of
damage.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
they're
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor,
i
will
just
have
to
recur
to
it.
i
will
--
while
mr.
potter
is
looking
for
it,
i
will
refer
to
the
basis
of
the
award
that
hanover
would
have
purchased
instead
it
was
forced
to
lease
and
the
cost
of
purchase
was
less
than
the
cost
of
leasing.
now
it's
conceded
that
in
the
calculation
that
i
will
come
to
later,
the
tax
saving
on
the
annual
and
monthly
rental
and
royalty
payments
were
omitted
and
its
conceded
that
those
would
have
amounted
to
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
which
together
with
the
charging
of
cost
of
capital
that
i
will
come
later
if
viewed
contemporaneously
as
the
time
of
purchase,
would
have
wiped
out
and
it's
so
called
benefit
of
purchase
and
made
purchase
$949,000
more
costly.
now
your
honor
asked
for
precedence.
on
page
9
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
in
treble-damage
cases,
i
do
not
know
of
any.
i
am
referring
to
the
reasoning
in
public
utility
commission,
1954
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
have
seen
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
appears
on
none
of
them
because
the
theory
of
the
damage
is
not
adapted
to
the
consideration
of
taxes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
perhaps
i
should
go
into
the
later
part
of
my
argument
and
call
to
your
honors
attention.
–-
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
my
experience
does
not
include
those
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
denial
the
right
to
purchase
has
resulted
in
a
comparison
of
purchase
price
with
aggregate
lease
charges.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
your
honor.
it
is
difficult
to
look
forward
to
supposititious
cases.
i
think
we
are
here
concerned
with
683
machines
which
were
leased.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
know
what
the
court
is
concerned
with,
but
i
will
submit
that
this
is
a
unique
situation.
i
know
no
situation,
i
can
conceive
of
none
where
a
lessee
who
has
leased
without
protest
for
here
16
years
in
fact
55
years
and
has
benefited
from
the
use
of
the
machines
very,
very
handsomely
and
is
never
has
to
buy
them
has
yet
recovered
an
award
on
the
basis
that
it
would
have
bought
them
and
if
that
is
to
be
done,
i
think
that
any
court
and
i
assume
your
honors
would
if
that
comes
in
that
comfortable
form,
any
court
would
have
to
say
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
here
as
to
taxes,
“calculations
must
include
those
elements
which
a
business
corporation
would
necessarily
consider
in
choosing
between
the
two
alternatives”.
now,
if
hanover,
no
monopoly
in
what
mr.
hayes
calls
a
free
market,
if
hanover
had
as
they
testified,
they
would
have
like
to
bought
the
united
machines
and
that
is
the
theory
of
the
recovery
here,
they
would
have
lost
the
benefit
of
the
annual
tax
savings.
they
would
have
gotten
certain
benefits
in
the
way
of
a
temporary
deduction
for
the
money
paid
out
on
the
purchase.
they
would
have
made
a
recovery
for
depreciation
and
so
on.
now
all
those
matters
were
laid
before
the
district
court
in
the
calculation
by
dr.
corson
which
is
defendant
exhibit
52
and
on
the
inclusion
of
cost
of
capital
along
with
the
tax
saving,
it
is
found
by
the
district
court
that
there
would
have
been
--
that
purchase
would
have
been
more
expensive
by
$949,000,
yet
the
district
court
left
those
entirely
out
of
the
calculation
on
the
basis
that
it
is
looking
backward
from
1962.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
we
would
not
have
that
calculation.
it
might
have
been
in
that
situation
that
the
tax
benefit
wouldn't
have
existed.
the
accountant
took
into
account
just
what
happened.
it
sets
forth
in
the
exhibit
the
hanover's
actual
tax
rates.
now,
the
surprising
thing
your
honors,
and
i
perhaps
should
develop
this
later
but
i
am
on
the
point
now
is
that
both
dr.
corson
testifying
as
an
expert
called
by
united
and
dr.
syrt
(ph)
an
economist,
a
academic
economist
called
by
hanover,
agreed
that
if
you
look
at
the
operations
year
by
year
on
the
assumption
of
a
choice
to
buy
or
to
lease
in
1939
or
1940
and
1941,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
tax
considerations
and
the
cost
of
capital
considerations
and
the
parties,
the
experts
parted
from
each
other
solely
on
the
basis
that
as
dr.
syrt
said,
“here,
i
have
got
the
computations
on
the
assumption
of
purchase
and
looking
backward
as
if
these
were
damages.
i
wouldn't
allow
for
taxes
or
cost
of
capital”.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
he
later
corrected
himself.
he
misspoke.
he
said
at
first,
the
tax
matter
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
he
corrected
himself
and
said
retroactivity
was
not
argued
by
us
in
this
way
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
my
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
69.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
mr.
hayes
will
agree
with
me
that
there
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
which
he
corrected
and
the
income
tax
point
was
argued
and
taken
up
and
accepted
by
court
of
appeals
on
reasoning
which
i
will
not
reiterate
because
it
seems
to
us
unexceptional.
now,
it
seems
to
us
your
honor
that
this
case
which
we
beg
to
leave
to
characterize
in
its
result
except
as
corrected
by
the
court
of
appeals,
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice,
this
case
presents
a
number
of
points
that
are
rather
remarkable
in
this
court.
in
this
case,
to
some
of
the
points
before
i
narrate
the
facts,
you
have
a
judgment
based
on
a
practice
of
leasing
which
was
no
injury
to
hanover,
but
a
benefit
to
it
and
which
it
testified
was
completely
satisfactory.
you
have
the
absence
of
a
demand
to
purchase.
you
have
an
underlying
decree
which
i
think
i
shall
demonstrate
did
not
condemn
the
lease
only
by
itself.
you
have
what
the
judge
wyzanski
himself
characterized
as
a
change
in
the
law
made
retroactive
by
the
district
court
here.
you
have
basic
errors
in
the
damage
calculation
that
i
have
briefly
mentioned
and
you
have
an
ignoring
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
all
adding
up
together
to
make
what
we
think
is
a
most
unjust
result.
now,
with
that
background
statement,
let
me
tell
the
court
briefly
from
the
record
what
has
happened
here.
hanover
began
as
a
small
family
company
making
shoes
in
pennsylvania.
it
was
organized
at
the
same
time
as
united
shoe
corporation
was
organized,
about
1900.
according
to
the
complaint,
the
lease
relationships
between
them
date
back
to
1912.
in
fact,
they
undoubtedly
date
back
much
earlier.
hanover
remained
a
small
family
company
until
1956
after
judge
wyzanski's
decree
when
for
the
first
time
in
1956
it
issued
some
stock
to
the
public.
by
1960,
having
begun
as
a
small
family
company,
it
was
one
of
the
35
biggest
and
most
prosperous
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
united
states.
its
profit
rate
regularly
increased
from
1939
on.
its
profit
figures
are
shown
at
page
245
of
the
joint
appendix
and
they
show
that
from
35
to
55
for
20
years,
they
went
up
from
about
$300,000
before
taxes
to
about
$4
million
before
taxes.
now,
this
relationship
with
united
was
partly
the
source
of
the
prosperity
at
hanover
and
the
relationship
as
i
say
was
continuous
since
at
least
1912.
it
was
in
1930
that
the
first
case
came
before
this
court
on
a
criminal
indictment
by
the
united
states
based
on
the
original
constitution
of
the
united
as
a
combination
of
machinery
companies.
and
the
dismissal
of
that
indictment
was
supported
by
this
--
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
holmes.
it
is
of
some
interest
in
view
of
our
contention
and
judge
wyzanski's
conclusion
that
united's
leasing
practice
has
the
approval
of
this
court
from
the
beginning.
it
is
of
some
interest
your
honor
to
note
what
the
solicitor
general
said
in
1913
in
presenting
his
first
claim
under
the
sherman
act.
he
said,
“this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
it's
legal
to
gather
together
into
one
corporation
about
80%
of
all
the
interstate
trade
in
some
particular
line
of
activity
when
it
is
done
gradually
by
legitimate
methods
and
without
any
unfair
competition
such
as
characterized
to
tobacco
and
standard
oil
cases.
if
that
is
legal,
the
sooner
the
business
world
understands
it,
the
better”.
on
that
particular
case
which
does
not
involve
the
propriety
of
the
leases,
this
court
held
the
conduct
of
united
was
legal.
to
resume
the
record
of
united
up
until
1953,
judge
wyzanski
in
his
careful
review
of
40
years
of
behavior
of
this
defendant
held
that
there
had
no
exhibited
no
predatory
practices,
no
monopoly
profits
and
there
had
been
developed
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
an
approval
of
the
leasing
policy
in
various
forms
by
three
successive
decisions
of
the
supreme
court.
this
was
1913
that
i
first
referred
to
in
this
court's
judgment.
in
1918
the
lessees
themselves
were
attacked
in
a
bill
in
equity
that
came
before
this
court
in
247
of
the
united
states,
and
there
was
a
division
of
the
court.
the
charge
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
both
sections
1
and
2.
and
there
your
honors,
we
will
find
a
sharp
division
between
mr.
hayes
and
myself.
mr.
hayes
has
said
in
downright
terms
that
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
approval
of
united's
leasing
practice.
i
ask
your
honors
to
read
the
opinions
both
of
justice
mckenna
and
the
dissent
of
justice
day
and
to
see
as
i
read
the
words
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leases
coerced
shoe
manufacturers
was
taken
up
and
disposed
off
and
the
court
held
they
were
not,
that
the
leases
were
not
coercive.
mr.
hayes'
language
was
carefully
selected
and
i
owe
it
to
him
to
say
that
what
he
really
asserted
in
this
court
was
that
the
prior
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
did
not
deal
with
the
exact
practices
that
judge
wyzanski
dealt
with.
that
is
true,
that's
true.
in
1922
as
he
said,
the
leases
were
altered
because
of
the
third
decision
of
this
court
under
the
clayton
act.
tying
causes
were
taken
out.
a
17-year
term
was
changed
to
a
10-year
term.
all
this
with
complete
silence
and
acquiescence
from
hanover.
the
leases
were
deformed
and
the
leasing
practice
went
on
but
what
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
hanover
case
is
what
is
called
lease
only,
that
is
to
say
inability
to
buy
certain
groups
of
machines.
the
gravamen
of
hanover's
case
as
i
shall
demonstrate
is
not
the
four
restrictive
causes
that
judge
wyzanski
condemned
in
1953
that
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
the
gravamen
is
the
continuance
of
leasing
only
for
the
distribution
of
the
more
important,
more
productive
and
more
lucrative
shoe
machines
such
as
hanover
used.
now
what
my
point
your
honors
is
that
throughout
the
clayton
act
case
in
1923,
the
sherman
act
case
in
1918
and
the
sherman
criminal
case
in
1930.
that
practice
of
lease
only
was
constant.
in
none
of
those
cases
was
the
--
none
of
those
situations
where
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
situation
described
by
the
courts
were
they
able
to
buy
the
machines
that
was
then
distributed
on
lease.
it
fair
to
say
that
the
court
did
not
discuss
that
question.
none
of
the
three
judgments
of
this
court
discussed
whether
or
not
inability
to
buy
was
a
violation.
i
do
not
think
judge
wyzanski
held
inability
to
buy
a
constitutional
violation
and
i
note
that
mr.
hayes
says
we
do
not
base
our
case
on
refusal
to
sell.
but
it
is
very
obvious,
is
it
not,
that
in
the
second
of
those
cases
247
us
when
the
divided
members
of
the
court
discussed
whether
or
not
the
existing
leases
then
more
honorous
were
coercive
of
shoe
makers.
the
majority
said
they
were
not
and
they
had
in
mind
--
must
have
in
mind
that
there
was
no
alternative
in
the
way
of
purchase.
and
we
have
put
in
our
brief
some
very
interesting
language
of
the
three-judge
court
in
massachusetts
which
discussed
in
considerable
detail
with
approval,
the
leasing
policy
so
far
as
concerned
shoe
manufacturers.
now,
we
are
dealing
here
with
hanover,
but
i
felt
it
necessary
to
lay
this
background
prior
to
judicial
approval
of
the
united
leasing
practice
that
is
a
lease
only
business
because
judge
wyzanski
said
in
his
opinion
which
you
have
all
read,
united
leasing
practices
were
never
condemned
but
were
in
part
endorsed
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
thank
you
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
do
have
before
you
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
why
you
have
the
merits
of
the
judgment
before
you?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
we
have
your
honor
a
number
of
points.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
our
first
point
is
that
the
government
decree,
that
is
the
first
point
in
our
brief,
on
which
this
judgment
is
founded
primarily,
did
not
constitute
an
adjudication
of
lease
only
as
a
violation
and
i
can
elaborate
that
by
saying
what
it
did
dictate.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
perhaps
should
have
said
that,
yes.
i
thought
justice
fortas
had
in
mind
that
we
have
a
cross-petition
in
463
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
in
which
we
have
stated
seven
questions.
that
is
one
of
them.
now,
should
i
go
on
to
elaborate
why
that
is
so?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
alright.
now,
our
second
point
is
that
the
judgment
of
judge
wyzanski
on
which
mr.
hayes
relies
not
being
a
condemnation
of
lease
only
for
the
past
as
a
violation,
did
condemn
it
for
the
future
and
required
us
to
sell
an
alternatively
and
optionally
and
we
did,
but
was
not
retroactive
in
effect.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
we
say
that
as
to
the
future.
the
requirement
to
sell
was
imposed
by
the
judge
affirmed
by
this
court,
we
are
doing
it.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
on
the
theory
of
the
lease
only.
now,
if
there
had
been
an
injury
to
hanover
from
the
four
restrictive
practices
in
the
leases
that
judge
wyzanski
particularly
discussed
and
condemned,
of
course
they
would
have
a
recovery.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
constantly.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
constantly.
we
have
the
cases
in
our
brief
which
determine
whether
or
not
the
eagle
lion
case
came
to
this
court
where
your
honors
divided
four
to
four
and
held
that
the
judgment
did
not
support
the
recovery
because
the
decree
did
not
deal
with
the
practice
which
injured
the
plaintiff.
i
have
a
number
of
cases
on
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
know
any
treble-damage
case
where
the
retroactivity
point
arose.
and
that
is
why
your
honor,
i
have
taken
time
to
recite
the
unique
record
of
judicial
approval
of
the
lease
only
policy
by
this
court
and
by
all
courts
until
in
1953,
judge
wyzanski
changed
it.
that
is
why
i
have
taken
the
time
to
do
that.
perhaps
i
should
in
view
of
your
honor's
question
addressed
myself
what
maybe
on
the
courts
mind
as
to
the
effect
of
a
reversal
here
on
other
treble-damage
cases
because
mr.
hayes
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
our
contentions
are
correct,
no
person
injured
by
an
antitrust
violation
can
recover
with
respect
to
the
past,
the
antitrust
violation
is
corrected
only
prospectively.
now
of
course
we
do
not
make
any
such
contention.
let
me
direct
myself
to
clause
4
of
the
decree.
the
decree
your
honors
is
in
the
bound
volume
of
the
joint
appendix
and
in
that
judge
wyzanski
said
the
leases
are
unduly
restrictive
in
that,
you
find
the
page
in
the
decree,
in
that
they
have
as
10-year
term
which
is
too
long.
they
have
a
repair
service
without
extra
charge.
they
have
a
full
capacity
clause
and
they
impose
return
charges
on
the
return
of
the
machines.
now
he
analyzed
all
those
in
relation
to
the
keeping
out
of
competition
of
shoe
machinery
manufacturers.
he
did
not
have
before
him
the
claims
of
any
private
parties,
but
he
did
have
the
claim
of
the
united
states
in
paragraph
61
of
the
complaint,
among
the
offenses
charged
said
paragraph
61,
as
united
has
declined
to
sell
its
most
important
machines.
now
that
was
dismissed
in
the
clause
of
the
decree
which
dismisses
on
the
merits
all
other
matters
than
these
four
clauses.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
drift
of
your
honor's
question
as
the
effect
on
treble-damages,
other
cases
would
be,
did
these
four
clauses
which
the
judge
condemned
injure
hanover?
it
is
perhaps
an
oversight
in
our
briefs,
we
didn't
even
discussed
that
question
because
it
was
never
claimed.
the
only
injury
ever
claimed
was
the
inability
to
buy
which
resulted
in
assertedly
excessive
leasing
charge.
but
let
me
go
back
to
these
four.
the
10-year
term
by
1939
when
limitations
begins,
all
the
older
machines
were
on
a
five-year
renewal
basis
and
as
to
new
ones,
there
was
a
free
right
of
return,
cutting
the
10-year
down
to
any
period
of
the
lessee
he
wished
because
united
have
its
own
volition
that
created
what
is
called
a
right
of
deduction
fund.
the
right
of
deduction
fund
was
made
up
out
of
royalties
paid
by
the
particular
lessee
and
credited
to
it
and
used
to
pay
return
charges.
now
as
to
shoe
machinery
makers,
judge
wyzanski
said
this
is
a
restrictive.
it
keeps
out
competitors,
but
as
to
shoe
manufacturers
like
hanover,
it
is
a
benefit
and
the
10-year
term
never
affected
it.
hanover
testified
at
page
301
of
the
record
that
it
never
had
to
pay
a
return
charge
for
this
reason.
second,
the
free
repair
service
is
charged
as
a
restrictive
practice
that
kept
out
shoe
machinery
makers,
but
as
to
hanover,
it
was
a
benefit
because
the
lessees
required
hanover
to
repair
the
machines
at
its
own
expense
and
united
did
it
at
its
expense.
and
while
the
court
found
that
hanover
paid
for
this
service
in
paying
lease
charges,
the
court
also
found
that
this
lease
charges
were
reasonable
and
i
cite
pages
51,
61,
100
and
189
of
the
joint
appendix.
third,
the
full
capacity
clause,
which
was
held
that
the
restrictive
devices
against
competitors,
mr.
sheppard
of
hanover
testified
it
was
never
enforced
against
him.
and
fourth,
the
return
charges
on
the
return
of
the
machines,
they
were
never
paid
by
hanover
because
of
its
continuing
credit
in
this
voluntarily
created
right
of
deduction
fund.
so
as
regards
the
impact
of
our
contention
on
any
other
treble-damage
cases
that
may
come
before
the
court,
we
say
that
giving
full
effect
to
the
adjudication
that
judge
wyzanski
made,
hanover
didn't
try
to
bring
itself
within
it
and
in
other
cases,
the
violation
is
found
for
the
past
but
of
course
people
injured
would
be
entitled
to
claim
on
the
injury.
but
there
again,
i
think
your
honors
would
be
interested
in
the
fact
that
not
only
did
hanover
never
complained
of
being
unable
to
buy
until
this
suit
was
filed
in
september
1955,
but
hanover
expressed
positive
satisfaction
with
the
leasing
system.
as
it
chanced,
the
defendant
brought
before
judge
wyzanski
on
his
trial,
a
number
of
shoe
manufacturers
testified
that
the
satisfactory
character
of
the
lease
only
system
without
particular
regard
to
these
four
objectionable
clauses
but
whether
they
would
prefer
to
buy
rather
than
to
lease.
and
somewhat
to
the
disbelief
of
judge
wyzanski,
all
the
13
whose
testimony
is
cited
at
page
14
of
our
main
brief
in
number
463,
all
13
who
were
produced,
testified,
no
they
like
leasing,
they
would
rather
lease
than
buy.
of
course
a
great
advantage
of
leasing
your
honors
is
that
it
puts
all
this
competitors
at
the
same
footing.
the
charges
are
uniform
and
above
all
as
judge
wyzanski
himself
said,
“small
companies
like
hanover
that
are
beginning,
have
no
capital,
can
get
full
equipment
of
machinery
by
just
paying
the
monthly
charge”.
now,
mr.
sheppard,
president
of
hanover,
was
going
to
be
asked
to
testify
among
those
people.
as
it
happened,
he
was
not
called.
the
testimony
was
getting
accumulated,
but
the
record
is
very
clear
as
to
what
he
said
in
an
interview
which
my
senior
partner
mr.
kendall
had
with
him
sheppard
in
1950
concerning
the
leasing
system.
i
cite
the
record
page
335,
mr.
sheppard
was
very
pro
united
shoe
and
the
only
thing
about
the
leases
which
he
did
not
like
was
the
fact
that
it
allowed
competition
to
hurt
him.
he
said
the
only
objection
i
have
to
leasing
is
the
fact
that
you
lease
everybody.
he
said
directly
on
the
record
united's
control
of
shoe
manufacturers
is
a
lot
of
nonsense.
he
said
quoted
by
a
person
at
the
interview,
“his
big
objection
against
the
leasing
system
was
that
it
caused
too
many
competitors
for
his
company.”
so
carrying
this
story
which
i
have
endeavored,
treat
chronologically,
down
to
1953,
you
have
a
situation
where
hanover
had
prospered
in
the
use
of
the
leases,
had
never
claimed
the
right
to
purchase
and
was
not
in
fact
affected
as
the
direct
object
of
the
monopoly
which
monopoly
was
directed
against
united's
competitors.
certainly
normal
that
the
monopolization
giving
united
a
control
of
the
shoe
machinery
market
would
exclude
shoe
machinery
manufacturers.
now,
the
fact
the
other
competitors
like
the
campbell
shoe
machinery
and
other
producers,
leased
their
machines
exclusively,
that
leasing
was
traditional
in
the
business,
that
it
had
been
going
on
since
the
civil
war.
all
that
of
course
did
not
save
united
from
the
restrictive
effects
of
these
four
clauses
which
kept
out
the
competitors,
but
these
four
clauses
did
not
affect
hanover.
now,
i
must
hurry
on
and
i
think
perhaps
i
had
better
get
for
just
a
moment
to
passing
on
since
mr.
hayes
mentioned
it.
i
thought
i
might
leave
it
to
the
briefs
because
it
is
after
all
largely
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
cases,
but
i
think
i
can
sum
up
by
saying
the
word
injury
in
the
clayton
act
has
been
treated
differently
by
different
courts
with
respect
to
whether
the
plaintiff
is
a
middle
man
or
a
consumer
of
the
product.
it
is
a
middle
man,
the
court
still
say
in
the
cases
that
are
cited,
is
passing
on
the
alleged
excess
cost
gives
him
no
cause
of
action,
but
it
is
the
consumer
who
uses
shoe
machinery
then
says
the
court
said
it's
different.
even
though
he
passed
on
the
excess
cost,
he
is
still
injured
because
as
mr.
hayes
reminds
you
the
theory
of
justice
holmes
in
a
railroad
and
not
an
antitrust
case
is
the
first
impact
is
what
counts.
that
does
not
seem
logical
and
it
does
not
seem
to
be
consonant.
with
your
honors'
decision
in
the
amec
case
cited
in
our
brief,
a
tax
case
that
where
plaintiff
has
transferred
the
obligation
he
undertook,
he
no
longer
has
a
cause
of
action.
but
as
the
cases
now
shaped,
the
passing
on
defense
is
very
different
from
it
has
been
in
any
other
case
before.
because
the
courts
below
did
hold
despite
what
mr.
hayes
said
and
our
brief
gives
the
references
that
the
lease
terms
and
rental
rates
between
the
parties
were
reasonable.
the
district
court
refused
to
find
them
unreasonable
and
in
other
comments,
the
district
court
said
granted
that
they
are
reasonable
and
leases
are
lawful
the
defendant
is
still
liable.
the
leases
then
were
alright.
they
are
not
objectionable.
it's
inability
to
but
that
is
objectionable.
now,
when
you
come
to
the
inability
to
buy,
what
the
plaintiff
has
done
is
to
total
up,
to
fabricate,
to
total
up
the
so
called
purchase
price.
that
purchase
price
certainly
could
not
be
asserted
before
1955
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
in
fact
it
was
only
calculated
in
1961.
that
perhaps
makes
no
difference,
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
year
after
year
during
the
16
years
of
this
alleged
violation,
hanover
not
only
was
making
up
profit
year
by
year
after
paying
the
$0.8
of
per
lease
charges.
but
according
to
a
stipulation
that
is
in
the
record
and
cited
in
our
brief,
in
making
this
profit,
it
calculated
the
cost
in
which
it
put
in
the
cost
of
shoe
machinery
so
that
by
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
hanover
had
been
completely
paid.
this
is
the
first
time
passing
on
has
come
before
this
court
since
justice
brandeis
intimated
in
the
kiel
case
back
in
1922
that
it
might
be
valid
defense
and
that
was
an
antitrust
case,
cited
in
our
briefs.
i
think
it
is
high
time
if
this
issue
comes
to
be
determinated
that
the
court
recognize
the
equity
of
not
allowing
a
satisfied
lessee
who
has
been
indemnified
out
of
his
resale
prices
to
victimize
the
defendant
with
a
treble-damage
charge
which
is
not
an
injury
because
at
the
time
of
the
lease
payments
the
transactions
were
lawful
according
to
the
courts
below.
another
point
which
is
dealt
with
a
great
deal
in
the
briefs,
but
i
believe
i
now
have
a
shorter
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
your
honor,
you
are
welcome.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no.
it
is
true
you
could
day
and
let
us
say
that
on
a
certain
machine
clicker
they
may
even
have
$5
a
month,
suppose
there
were
$4,
hanover
would
have
paid
$4
instead
of
$5
bit
remember
all
competitors
would
too.
and
what
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
in
the
kiel
case
if
they
are
all
treated
alike
and
they
all
get
the
benefit
of
the
same
change
and
they
are
competing
with
each
other
not
with
the
united,
who
can
decide
that
it
would
make
any
difference.
of
course
judge
goodrich
says
maybe
they
could
have
bought
more
leather.
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
connected
proposition.
what
i
was
coming,
i
don't
know
if
i
have
answered
your
honor's
question,
what
i
was
coming
to
say
was
to
simplify
the
calculating
--
the
damage
calculation
point.
i
think
mr.
hayes
has
given
me
the
opening
that
i
require.
i
cannot
of
course
involve
this
court
in
the
details
of
an
elaborate
calculation
the
district
court
went
through.
hanover
has
attached
as
an
appendix
to
its
brief
the
written
description
by
judge
sheridan
who
was
certainly
very
patient
about
the
matter
as
to
how
he
saw
the
damage
calculations.
now,
this
written
description,
i
criticize
in
two
particulars
that
i
have
already
adverted
to
and
that
i
recall
to
your
honors
as
determinating,
the
tax
benefit
of
the
lease
payments
actually
made
and
the
cost
of
capital
consideration.
now
the
cost
of
capital
is
defined
by
the
district
court
as
the
rate
of
return
which
investors
expect
on
the
money
they
put
in
the
company.
and
the
conception
is
that
if
hanover
spends
a
million
dollars
buying
shoe
machinery,
it's
a
lost
of
money
unless
it
makes
out
of
that
shoe
machinery
what
the
return
has
to
be
put
to
investors
on
the
million
dollars
that
they
have
put
in.
the
concept
is
described
abundantly
in
the
record.
the
only
thing
that
both
judge
sheridan
and
mr.
hayes
have
criticized
about
it
is
what
i
freely
admit
that
the
cost
of
capital
could
be
computed
different
ways.
but
that
there
is
such
an
item
as
cost
of
capital
to
be
taken
into
account
in
a
fair
comparison
your
honors
of
leasing
versus
ownership
is
agreed
by
both
sides.
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
what
the
briefs
should
bring
out
that
when
hanover
purchased
used
shoe
machinery
from
united
pursuant
to
the
decree
and
the
prices
of
this
machinery
were
worked
out
in
negotiations
between
shoe
manufacturers
as
a
group
and
united.
each
side
had
an
economist
dr.
joel
dean
and
dr.
robert
anthony,
and
each
economist
said,
“in
reaching
this
price,
we
have
got
to
compute
the
cost
of
capital
for
the
entire
group”.
dean
said
it
was
10%.
anthony
said
it
was
18%.
i
only
cite
this
to
illustrate
that
it
is
an
item
that
exists.
and
if
you're
going
to
look
at
purchase
versus
lease
contemporaneously
when
hanover
had
to
make
the
decision
which
i
would
say
is
the
only
fair
way
to
look
at
it,
you
would
have
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
the
decisions
were
supposititiously
made
that
is
39,
40,
41
and
so
on
when
hanover
actually
leased,
but
now
it
says,
it
would
have
liked
to
buy.
now
as
it
happens,
the
arithmetical
consequences
of
the
two
methods
are
laid
out
clearly
in
exhibits
before
the
court.
there
are
three
or
four
of
these
great
exhibits
so
called
the
lightest
of
calculations
made
by
statisticians
on
assumptions
of
counsel.
they
omit
taxes
and
cost
of
capital.
and
there
are
on
the
other
side,
our
calculations
which
include
them
and
those
are
exhibits
48,
51
and
52.
only
the
first
two,
i
am
sorry
to
say,
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
the
allowance
for
these
two
items
on
the
basis
of
contemporaneous
choice
shows
uncontestably
that
purchase
would
have
cost
$949,000
more
than
leasing
did.
and
that
of
course
is
why
as
i
would
assume,
hanover
was
content
to
lease.
now
this
approach
does
not
rest
exclusively
on
my
i
say
so
as
an
advocate.
i
cite
the
statement
of
hanover's
expert
at
page
562
of
the
record
where
he
said
“is
it
your
point
that
the
lightest
of
calculations
and
those
are
the
plaintiff's
calculations
omitting
cost
of
capital,
etcetera,
the
lightest
of
calculations
were
not
documents
which
would
be
presented
to
management
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
buy
or
to
lease”.
“oh,
definitely
not”
he
says.
on
the
other
hand,
he
says
that
what
we
have
computed
with
the
allowance
of
these
factors
at
page
561
is
basically
the
kind
of
thing
that
one
would
present
to
management
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
buy
or
to
lease
and
he
says
elsewhere
at
page
547
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
fortas
to
taxes
in
this
context.
this
is
the
plaintiffs'
expert
richard
m.
syrt,
i
would
heartily
endorse
the
notion
of
introducing
taxes
on
making
a
decision
on
preparing
data
for
management
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
they
should
purchase
or
not.
so
here
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
issue
that
the
court
has
to
decide
in
balancing
these
enormous
amounts
of
money
and
these
recounted
calculations,
it
is
a
simple
common
sense
question
in
deciding
the
equities
between
the
parties
as
to
relative
costs
of
the
two
methods.
do
you
look
at
it
at
the
time
when
the
plaintiff
deprived
of
the
right
to
purchase,
wanted
to
purchase
and
could
not
which
we
say
or
do
you
look
at
it
in
a
way
which
mr.
hayes
persuaded
the
district
court
to
err
by
miracle
of
advocacy,
taking
this
great
volumes
saying
these
are
the
assumed
cost
of
purchase,
tell
me
whether
or
not
the
cost
of
capital
and
taxes
should
go
into
those.
and
the
expert
says
“oh
no
of
course
you
can't
do
it
backwards.
you
can't
do
it
backwards,
if
you
made
the
decision
leaving
them
out.”
well
says
dr.
syrt,
“i
am
not
going
to
put
them
in”.
now
that
as
i
would
perhaps
emphasize
i
perhaps
summed
up
all
too
briefly
is
where
the
case
stands
on
damages
and
i
think
a
gross
injustice
has
been
done
by
leaving
out
these
prime
economic
factors
built
into
the
question
of
purchase,
but
perhaps
even
the
worst
thing
that
is
not
really
mentioned
in
our
brief
because
we
had
too
much
to
talk
about
is
what
your
honors
are
constantly
familiar
with
on
installment
sales,
this
plaintiff
has
added
together
without
discount
for
present
value
all
the
lease
payments
over
16
years.
you
got
a
total
and
he
has
compared
it
with
a
single
purchase
price.
of
course
everybody
knows
that
one
purchase
is
cheaper
than
16
time
payments
in
point
of
adding
gross
dollars.
but
the
discount
for
present
value
is
what
brings
it
back
to
a
fair
comparative
status.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
none,
none.
on
what
i
have
just
said
your
honor
a
part
from
all
other
factors,
lack
of
demand
and
so
on
the
inability
to
purchase
cost
hanover
nothing
and
if
it
had
bought,
it
would
have
been
$900,000
more
costly.
so
there
are
no
damages.
and
i
would
not
of
course
it
seems
to
me
from
where
i
stand,
be
at
all
affronted
by
the
possibility
that
an
antitrust
violator
has
in
given
case
created
no
damage.
i
seem
to
find
in
the
commentators
and
occasionally
--
in
the
judicial
opinions
the
suggestion
that
where
a
monopoly
is
found
we
have
got
to
find
someone
to
punish
and
the
plaintiff,
whoever
comes
into
court
with
a
statutory
counsel
fee
he
is
the
private
attorney
general
who
administers
the
punishment.
i
do
not
think
the
vindication
of
majesty
of
the
law
rests
solely
on
private
plaintiffs
or
rests
on
any
important
particular.
if
the
government
failed
in
a
criminal
indictment
in
1913
on
the
judgment
of
your
honors'
predecessors,
if
the
government
failed
in
the
bill
of
equity
in
1923,
was
it,
on
the
decision
of
the
court
at
that
time.
and
if
the
clayton
act
violations
were
repaired
as
they
were
in
the
third
case
then
i
do
not
think
that
when
united
comes
to
a
judgment
that
on
a
new
development
in
the
law
due
to
the
american
tobacco
case,
there
is
a
correction
that
must
be
made
and
there
is
a
violation.
i
do
not
think
it
inheres
in
the
angel
of
justice
to
find
some
private
person
who
is
got
to
make
money
out
of
it.
judge
wyzanski
cured
the
errors,
the
violations.
he
laid
down
a
strict
decree
and
in
the
case
number
597
that
have
come
before
your
honors
at
the
end
of
the
month,
you
will
find
that
decree
has
been
scrupulously
complied
with.
now
that
is
the
form
of
redress
that
majesty
of
the
law.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
a
congressional
direction
what
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes
sir.
i
fully
accede
and
realize
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
in
some
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
with
difference,
i
should
not
myself
feel
that
was
so.
i
am
of
course
speaking
only
on
this
record
and
in
relation
to
the
rights
of
my
client
and
the
facts
of
this
case
but
i
would
not
assume
--
i
would
not
think
that
because
lease
only,
the
inability
to
buy
was
not
condemned
by
judge
wyzanski
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
hanover
on
that
ground
among
others
had
no
standing.
i
would
not
think
that
for
that
reason
all
other
plaintiffs
are
out
of
court.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
am
under
some
handicap
if
i'm
obliged
to
answer
with
respect
to
a
state
of
fact
in
your
honors
mind
but
not
my
own.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
say
in
vacuum.
i
say
in
context
to
the
law
and
with
a
strict
adherence
to
the
decision
which
is
relied
on
under
the
clayton
act
as
the
basis
of
this
recovery.
now
this
comes
germane
to
whatever
i
was
next
going
to
say.
excuse
me
sir,
if
i
attempted
to
answer
your
honors
point,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
dealt
with
it
all.
you
have
warned
me
that
i
must
not
claim
too
much.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
have
responded
the
best
way
i
can.
let
me
look
the
particular
point
which
is
here.
under
the
rule
of
the
amec
case
in
clayton
act,
section
4,
it
is
the
decree
in
the
underlying
government
case
that
has
the
effect
of
an
estoppel
and
an
estoppel
only
so
far
as
the
decree
goes
and
one
of
the
differences
between
mr.
hayes
and
myself
is
how
far
the
decree
goes
and
our
brief
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
say
not
only
does
judge
wyzanski
not
condemned
lease
only
by
itself,
but
this
court
had
approved
lease
only
up
until
1953
or
1954
when
you
affirmed
judge
wyzanski.
and
judge
wyzanski
himself
thought
that
you
had
approved
it
and
judge
wyzanski
dismissed
the
clause
in
the
government's
complaint
paragraph
61
which
attacked
the
refusal
to
sell,
but
i
go
further.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
judge
sheridan's
interpretation
of
the
decree
was
so
different
not
only
from
our
own,
but
from
that
of
another
district
judge,
judge
berk
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
the
coon
case,
the
complaint
is
a
copy
of
the
hanover
complaint.
in
view
of
that,
we
asked
judge
wyzanski
in
exercise
of
his
reserved
jurisdiction
of
the
government
case
to
amend
or
interpret
his
own
decree.
hanover
appeared
and
opposed
and
the
government
counsel,
being
the
government
case
appeared.
judge
wyzanski
in
difference
to
judge
sheridan
refused
to
interfere
on
account
of
comity
of
coordinate
courts.
but
he
said,
have
you
not
considered
the
practice
that
the
supreme
court
approves
in
erie
against
tompkins
case
of
certifying
the
question
from
the
treble
damage
court
to
the
antitrust
court.
in
the
course
of
that
colloquy,
judge
wyzanski
had
before
him
as
i
said
government
counsel
and
the
interesting
colloquy
which
he
had
with
government
counsel
appears
on
pages
19
and
21
of
our
brief
and
it
is
in
the
record
and
not
to
read
too
long
because
you
have
it
all
before
you,
judge
wyzanski
made
this
arresting
remark
addressed
to
government
counsel
who
under
the
rule
of
the
amec
case
was
the
party
entitled
to
enforce
the
estoppel
that
hanover
would
enforce.
the
judge
said
at
page
20
“now
that
you
are
here,
are
you
not
aware
from
being
here
on
previous
occasions
that
the
government
never
contended
and
i
never
ruled
as
judge
sheridan
supposes
the
matter
was
decided.”
that
was
a
clear
information
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
a
clear
information
that
judge
wyzanski
thought
that
judge
sheridan
was
wrong
in
interpreting
the
decree
and
decision
of
judge
wyzanski.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
particularly
since
we
tried
to
implement
it.
we
did
not
think
we
have
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
is
the
binding
construction
because
judge
sheridan
made
a
construction.
we
said
we
tried
to
implement
it
by
asking
for
a
reference
and
certification
of
questions
such
as
your
honors'
approved
in
the
national
gypsum
case
to
avoid
multiple
and
conflicting
decisions.
and
judge
sheridan
for
reason
still
not
clear
to
me
refused
to
depart
from
the
decision
that
he
had
made
which
was
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there's
much
merit
in
united's
construction
of
this
language
and
much
merit
in
united's
statement
that
the
decree
of
wyzanski
did
not
hit
lease
only.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
unfortunately
the
application
is
not
timely.
the
application
was
made
by
us
as
soon
as
we
could
after
judge
sheridan
rendered
his
decision
and
before
judgment.
and
there
is
authority
in
the
books
that
when
you
do
have
a
proper
reference
question
it's
fit
and
proper
to
first
take
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
because
it
may
well
be
that
it
would
be
superfluous
to
go
to
a
reference
if
on
other
grounds
the
case
goes
off
another
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
felt
and
said
that
our
position
had
much
merit
let
us
say,
but
for
reasons
that
are
not
clear
to
me,
it
could
not
take,
accept
our
argument
even
though
directed
to
the
maintenance
of
a
just
result
in
a
basic
feature
of
the
case
which
is
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
government
decree.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
we
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
at
the
tax
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
i
do
think
so.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
there
was
none.
we
made
a
new
motion
for
new
trial
under
the
rule
and
i
attached
that
and
it
was
a
subject
of
discussion
before
judge
sheridan.
now
that
this
is
a
basic
point
and
the
meaning
of
the
decree
is
so
vital
and
$5
million
turns
on
it
and
the
case
had
lasted
in
the
district
court
for
years
and
years.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
not
unless
he
is
invited
to
by
the
court
having
jurisdiction.
now
i
have
not
had
time
to
emphasize
the
lack
of
demand
and
inadequacy
of
the
finding
that
hanover
would
have
bought
machines.
that
is
basic
to
the
whole
the
case
and
all
the
district
judge
said,
is
it
likely
would
have
bought
machine.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
your
affirmance
was
a
per
curiam.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
it
affirmed
what
he
found
and
what
he
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
is
indeed.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
you
may
and
i
think
you
should
take
into
account
in
doing
so,
but
i
refer
to
my
brief
where
counsel
for
the
government
said
lease
only
was
not
attacked
on
the
appeal.
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
hanover's
favor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
mean
hanover's
favor?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
united
shoe
machinery
corporation,
appellant
in
number
463,
appellee
in
number
335,
i
should
like
to
present
the
case
differently
from
the
order
of
points
and
the
detailed
analysis
that
your
honors
will
see
in
the
brief
in
the
form
of
a
narration
of
what
happened
in
the
relations
between
the
parties
in
order
that
you
may
see
this
points
developed
as
we
go
along.
first
however,
i
should
like
while
the
statements
are
fresh
in
your
honors
mind
to
emphasize
two
points,
indeed
concessions,
that
mr.
hayes
has
made
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
the
first
statement
to
me
remarkable
and
i
wrote
it
down;
we
are
not
suing
on
the
basis
of
refusal
to
sell.
he
goes
on
to
say,
“we
are
suing
for
damage
due
for
monopolization.”
but
what
i
ask
your
honors
is
the
monopolization
accept
inability
to
buy
and
how
are
the
damages
computed
except
by
comparing
so
called
ownership
costs
with
so
called
lease
costs.
why
then
does
hanover
say
it
is
not
suing
for
refusal
to
sell
because
the
courts
below
held
a
finding
that
is
not
contested
that
there
was
no
demand?
now
the
second
interesting
point
which
mr.
hayes
made
which
is
basic
to
his
argument
is
the
point
that
the
tax
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
because
it
charges
hanover
with
taxes
or
the
effect
of
income
taxes
on
the
judgment
of
the
damages
it
has
proved.
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
that
mr.
hayes
argued
that
that
is
wrong,
that
the
court
of
appeals
wrongly
pursued
the
theory
of
hanover
having
a
choice,
the
choices
of
fiction,
and
that
since
it
had
no
choice,
and
because
of
inability
to
buy,
hanover
could
not
be
charged
with
income
tax
savings
in
the
course
of
the
assumed
purchased
operation
or
put
it
in
the
words
of
hanover's
last
brief
in
number
335
the
blue
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
in
espousing
in
a
fiction
of
choice
was
espousing
a
self
destructive
argument
and
one
that
automatically
abolished
the
possibility
of
damage.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
they're
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor,
i
will
just
have
to
recur
to
it.
i
will
--
while
mr.
potter
is
looking
for
it,
i
will
refer
to
the
basis
of
the
award
that
hanover
would
have
purchased
instead
it
was
forced
to
lease
and
the
cost
of
purchase
was
less
than
the
cost
of
leasing.
now
it's
conceded
that
in
the
calculation
that
i
will
come
to
later,
the
tax
saving
on
the
annual
and
monthly
rental
and
royalty
payments
were
omitted
and
its
conceded
that
those
would
have
amounted
to
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
which
together
with
the
charging
of
cost
of
capital
that
i
will
come
later
if
viewed
contemporaneously
as
the
time
of
purchase,
would
have
wiped
out
and
it's
so
called
benefit
of
purchase
and
made
purchase
$949,000
more
costly.
now
your
honor
asked
for
precedence.
on
page

--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
in
treble-damage
cases,
i
do
not
know
of
any.
i
am
referring
to
the
reasoning
in
public
utility
commission,
1954
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
have
seen
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
appears
on
none
of
them
because
the
theory
of
the
damage
is
not
adapted
to
the
consideration
of
taxes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
perhaps
i
should
go
into
the
later
part
of
my
argument
and
call
to
your
honors
attention.
–-
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
my
experience
does
not
include
those
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
denial
the
right
to
purchase
has
resulted
in
a
comparison
of
purchase
price
with
aggregate
lease
charges.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
your
honor.
it
is
difficult
to
look
forward
to
supposititious
cases.
i
think
we
are
here
concerned
with
683
machines
which
were
leased.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
know
what
the
court
is
concerned
with,
but
i
will
submit
that
this
is
a
unique
situation.
i
know
no
situation,
i
can
conceive
of
none
where
a
lessee
who
has
leased
without
protest
for
here
16
years
in
fact
55
years
and
has
benefited
from
the
use
of
the
machines
very,
very
handsomely
and
is
never
has
to
buy
them
has
yet
recovered
an
award
on
the
basis
that
it
would
have
bought
them
and
if
that
is
to
be
done,
i
think
that
any
court
and
i
assume
your
honors
would
if
that
comes
in
that
comfortable
form,
any
court
would
have
to
say
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
here
as
to
taxes,
“calculations
must
include
those
elements
which
a
business
corporation
would
necessarily
consider
in
choosing
between
the
two
alternatives”.
now,
if
hanover,
no
monopoly
in
what
mr.
hayes
calls
a
free
market,
if
hanover
had
as
they
testified,
they
would
have
like
to
bought
the
united
machines
and
that
is
the
theory
of
the
recovery
here,
they
would
have
lost
the
benefit
of
the
annual
tax
savings.
they
would
have
gotten
certain
benefits
in
the
way
of
a
temporary
deduction
for
the
money
paid
out
on
the
purchase.
they
would
have
made
a
recovery
for
depreciation
and
so
on.
now
all
those
matters
were
laid
before
the
district
court
in
the
calculation
by
dr.
corson
which
is
defendant
exhibit
52
and
on
the
inclusion
of
cost
of
capital
along
with
the
tax
saving,
it
is
found
by
the
district
court
that
there
would
have
been
--
that
purchase
would
have
been
more
expensive
by
$949,000,
yet
the
district
court
left
those
entirely
out
of
the
calculation
on
the
basis
that
it
is
looking
backward
from
1962.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
we
would
not
have
that
calculation.
it
might
have
been
in
that
situation
that
the
tax
benefit
wouldn't
have
existed.
the
accountant
took
into
account
just
what
happened.
it
sets
forth
in
the
exhibit
the
hanover's
actual
tax
rates.
now,
the
surprising
thing
your
honors,
and
i
perhaps
should
develop
this
later
but
i
am
on
the
point
now
is
that
both
dr.
corson
testifying
as
an
expert
called
by
united
and
dr.
syrt
(ph)
an
economist,
a
academic
economist
called
by
hanover,
agreed
that
if
you
look
at
the
operations
year
by
year
on
the
assumption
of
a
choice
to
buy
or
to
lease
in
1939
or
1940
and
1941,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
tax
considerations
and
the
cost
of
capital
considerations
and
the
parties,
the
experts
parted
from
each
other
solely
on
the
basis
that
as
dr.
syrt
said,
“here,
i
have
got
the
computations
on
the
assumption
of
purchase
and
looking
backward
as
if
these
were
damages.
i
wouldn't
allow
for
taxes
or
cost
of
capital”.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
he
later
corrected
himself.
he
misspoke.
he
said
at
first,
the
tax
matter
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
he
corrected
himself
and
said
retroactivity
was
not
argued
by
us
in
this
way
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
my
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
69.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
mr.
hayes
will
agree
with
me
that
there
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
which
he
corrected
and
the
income
tax
point
was
argued
and
taken
up
and
accepted
by
court
of
appeals
on
reasoning
which
i
will
not
reiterate
because
it
seems
to
us
unexceptional.
now,
it
seems
to
us
your
honor
that
this
case
which
we
beg
to
leave
to
characterize
in
its
result
except
as
corrected
by
the
court
of
appeals,
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice,
this
case
presents
a
number
of
points
that
are
rather
remarkable
in
this
court.
in
this
case,
to
some
of
the
points
before
i
narrate
the
facts,
you
have
a
judgment
based
on
a
practice
of
leasing
which
was
no
injury
to
hanover,
but
a
benefit
to
it
and
which
it
testified
was
completely
satisfactory.
you
have
the
absence
of
a
demand
to
purchase.
you
have
an
underlying
decree
which
i
think
i
shall
demonstrate
did
not
condemn
the
lease
only
by
itself.
you
have
what
the
judge
wyzanski
himself
characterized
as
a
change
in
the
law
made
retroactive
by
the
district
court
here.
you
have
basic
errors
in
the
damage
calculation
that
i
have
briefly
mentioned
and
you
have
an
ignoring
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
all
adding
up
together
to
make
what
we
think
is
a
most
unjust
result.
now,
with
that
background
statement,
let
me
tell
the
court
briefly
from
the
record
what
has
happened
here.
hanover
began
as
a
small
family
company
making
shoes
in
pennsylvania.
it
was
organized
at
the
same
time
as
united
shoe
corporation
was
organized,
about
1900.
according
to
the
complaint,
the
lease
relationships
between
them
date
back
to
1912.
in
fact,
they
undoubtedly
date
back
much
earlier.
hanover
remained
a
small
family
company
until
1956
after
judge
wyzanski's
decree
when
for
the
first
time
in
1956
it
issued
some
stock
to
the
public.
by
1960,
having
begun
as
a
small
family
company,
it
was
one
of
the
35
biggest
and
most
prosperous
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
united
states.
its
profit
rate
regularly
increased
from
1939
on.
its
profit
figures
are
shown
at
page
245
of
the
joint
appendix
and
they
show
that
from
35
to
55
for
20
years,
they
went
up
from
about
$300,000
before
taxes
to
about
$4
million
before
taxes.
now,
this
relationship
with
united
was
partly
the
source
of
the
prosperity
at
hanover
and
the
relationship
as
i
say
was
continuous
since
at
least
1912.
it
was
in
1930
that
the
first
case
came
before
this
court
on
a
criminal
indictment
by
the
united
states
based
on
the
original
constitution
of
the
united
as
a
combination
of
machinery
companies.
and
the
dismissal
of
that
indictment
was
supported
by
this
--
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
holmes.
it
is
of
some
interest
in
view
of
our
contention
and
judge
wyzanski's
conclusion
that
united's
leasing
practice
has
the
approval
of
this
court
from
the
beginning.
it
is
of
some
interest
your
honor
to
note
what
the
solicitor
general
said
in
1913
in
presenting
his
first
claim
under
the
sherman
act.
he
said,
“this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
it's
legal
to
gather
together
into
one
corporation
about
80%
of
all
the
interstate
trade
in
some
particular
line
of
activity
when
it
is
done
gradually
by
legitimate
methods
and
without
any
unfair
competition
such
as
characterized
to
tobacco
and
standard
oil
cases.
if
that
is
legal,
the
sooner
the
business
world
understands
it,
the
better”.
on
that
particular
case
which
does
not
involve
the
propriety
of
the
leases,
this
court
held
the
conduct
of
united
was
legal.
to
resume
the
record
of
united
up
until
1953,
judge
wyzanski
in
his
careful
review
of
40
years
of
behavior
of
this
defendant
held
that
there
had
no
exhibited
no
predatory
practices,
no
monopoly
profits
and
there
had
been
developed
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
an
approval
of
the
leasing
policy
in
various
forms
by
three
successive
decisions
of
the
supreme
court.
this
was
1913
that
i
first
referred
to
in
this
court's
judgment.
in
1918
the
lessees
themselves
were
attacked
in
a
bill
in
equity
that
came
before
this
court
in
247
of
the
united
states,
and
there
was
a
division
of
the
court.
the
charge
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
both
sections
1
and
2.
and
there
your
honors,
we
will
find
a
sharp
division
between
mr.
hayes
and
myself.
mr.
hayes
has
said
in
downright
terms
that
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
approval
of
united's
leasing
practice.
i
ask
your
honors
to
read
the
opinions
both
of
justice
mckenna
and
the
dissent
of
justice
day
and
to
see
as
i
read
the
words
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leases
coerced
shoe
manufacturers
was
taken
up
and
disposed
off
and
the
court
held
they
were
not,
that
the
leases
were
not
coercive.
mr.
hayes'
language
was
carefully
selected
and
i
owe
it
to
him
to
say
that
what
he
really
asserted
in
this
court
was
that
the
prior
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
did
not
deal
with
the
exact
practices
that
judge
wyzanski
dealt
with.
that
is
true,
that's
true.
in
1922
as
he
said,
the
leases
were
altered
because
of
the
third
decision
of
this
court
under
the
clayton
act.
tying
causes
were
taken
out.
a
17-year
term
was
changed
to
a
10-year
term.
all
this
with
complete
silence
and
acquiescence
from
hanover.
the
leases
were
deformed
and
the
leasing
practice
went
on
but
what
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
hanover
case
is
what
is
called
lease
only,
that
is
to
say
inability
to
buy
certain
groups
of
machines.
the
gravamen
of
hanover's
case
as
i
shall
demonstrate
is
not
the
four
restrictive
causes
that
judge
wyzanski
condemned
in
1953
that
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
the
gravamen
is
the
continuance
of
leasing
only
for
the
distribution
of
the
more
important,
more
productive
and
more
lucrative
shoe
machines
such
as
hanover
used.
now
what
my
point
your
honors
is
that
throughout
the
clayton
act
case
in
1923,
the
sherman
act
case
in
1918
and
the
sherman
criminal
case
in
1930.
that
practice
of
lease
only
was
constant.
in
none
of
those
cases
was
the
--
none
of
those
situations
where
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
situation
described
by
the
courts
were
they
able
to
buy
the
machines
that
was
then
distributed
on
lease.
it
fair
to
say
that
the
court
did
not
discuss
that
question.
none
of
the
three
judgments
of
this
court
discussed
whether
or
not
inability
to
buy
was
a
violation.
i
do
not
think
judge
wyzanski
held
inability
to
buy
a
constitutional
violation
and
i
note
that
mr.
hayes
says
we
do
not
base
our
case
on
refusal
to
sell.
but
it
is
very
obvious,
is
it
not,
that
in
the
second
of
those
cases
247
us
when
the
divided
members
of
the
court
discussed
whether
or
not
the
existing
leases
then
more
honorous
were
coercive
of
shoe
makers.
the
majority
said
they
were
not
and
they
had
in
mind
--
must
have
in
mind
that
there
was
no
alternative
in
the
way
of
purchase.
and
we
have
put
in
our
brief
some
very
interesting
language
of
the
three-judge
court
in
massachusetts
which
discussed
in
considerable
detail
with
approval,
the
leasing
policy
so
far
as
concerned
shoe
manufacturers.
now,
we
are
dealing
here
with
hanover,
but
i
felt
it
necessary
to
lay
this
background
prior
to
judicial
approval
of
the
united
leasing
practice
that
is
a
lease
only
business
because
judge
wyzanski
said
in
his
opinion
which
you
have
all
read,
united
leasing
practices
were
never
condemned
but
were
in
part
endorsed
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
thank
you
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
do
have
before
you
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
why
you
have
the
merits
of
the
judgment
before
you?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
we
have
your
honor
a
number
of
points.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
our
first
point
is
that
the
government
decree,
that
is
the
first
point
in
our
brief,
on
which
this
judgment
is
founded
primarily,
did
not
constitute
an
adjudication
of
lease
only
as
a
violation
and
i
can
elaborate
that
by
saying
what
it
did
dictate.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
perhaps
should
have
said
that,
yes.
i
thought
justice
fortas
had
in
mind
that
we
have
a
cross-petition
in
463
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
in
which
we
have
stated
seven
questions.
that
is
one
of
them.
now,
should
i
go
on
to
elaborate
why
that
is
so?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
alright.
now,
our
second
point
is
that
the
judgment
of
judge
wyzanski
on
which
mr.
hayes
relies
not
being
a
condemnation
of
lease
only
for
the
past
as
a
violation,
did
condemn
it
for
the
future
and
required
us
to
sell
an
alternatively
and
optionally
and
we
did,
but
was
not
retroactive
in
effect.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
we
say
that
as
to
the
future.
the
requirement
to
sell
was
imposed
by
the
judge
affirmed
by
this
court,
we
are
doing
it.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
on
the
theory
of
the
lease
only.
now,
if
there
had
been
an
injury
to
hanover
from
the
four
restrictive
practices
in
the
leases
that
judge
wyzanski
particularly
discussed
and
condemned,
of
course
they
would
have
a
recovery.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
constantly.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
constantly.
we
have
the
cases
in
our
brief
which
determine
whether
or
not
the
eagle
lion
case
came
to
this
court
where
your
honors
divided
four
to
four
and
held
that
the
judgment
did
not
support
the
recovery
because
the
decree
did
not
deal
with
the
practice
which
injured
the
plaintiff.
i
have
a
number
of
cases
on
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
know
any
treble-damage
case
where
the
retroactivity
point
arose.
and
that
is
why
your
honor,
i
have
taken
time
to
recite
the
unique
record
of
judicial
approval
of
the
lease
only
policy
by
this
court
and
by
all
courts
until
in
1953,
judge
wyzanski
changed
it.
that
is
why
i
have
taken
the
time
to
do
that.
perhaps
i
should
in
view
of
your
honor's
question
addressed
myself
what
maybe
on
the
courts
mind
as
to
the
effect
of
a
reversal
here
on
other
treble-damage
cases
because
mr.
hayes
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
our
contentions
are
correct,
no
person
injured
by
an
antitrust
violation
can
recover
with
respect
to
the
past,
the
antitrust
violation
is
corrected
only
prospectively.
now
of
course
we
do
not
make
any
such
contention.
let
me
direct
myself
to
clause
4
of
the
decree.
the
decree
your
honors
is
in
the
bound
volume
of
the
joint
appendix
and
in
that
judge
wyzanski
said
the
leases
are
unduly
restrictive
in
that,
you
find
the
page
in
the
decree,
in
that
they
have
as
10-year
term
which
is
too
long.
they
have
a
repair
service
without
extra
charge.
they
have
a
full
capacity
clause
and
they
impose
return
charges
on
the
return
of
the
machines.
now
he
analyzed
all
those
in
relation
to
the
keeping
out
of
competition
of
shoe
machinery
manufacturers.
he
did
not
have
before
him
the
claims
of
any
private
parties,
but
he
did
have
the
claim
of
the
united
states
in
paragraph
61
of
the
complaint,
among
the
offenses
charged
said
paragraph
61,
as
united
has
declined
to
sell
its
most
important
machines.
now
that
was
dismissed
in
the
clause
of
the
decree
which
dismisses
on
the
merits
all
other
matters
than
these
four
clauses.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
drift
of
your
honor's
question
as
the
effect
on
treble-damages,
other
cases
would
be,
did
these
four
clauses
which
the
judge
condemned
injure
hanover?
it
is
perhaps
an
oversight
in
our
briefs,
we
didn't
even
discussed
that
question
because
it
was
never
claimed.
the
only
injury
ever
claimed
was
the
inability
to
buy
which
resulted
in
assertedly
excessive
leasing
charge.
but
let
me
go
back
to
these
four.
the
10-year
term
by
1939
when
limitations
begins,
all
the
older
machines
were
on
a
five-year
renewal
basis
and
as
to
new
ones,
there
was
a
free
right
of
return,
cutting
the
10-year
down
to
any
period
of
the
lessee
he
wished
because
united
have
its
own
volition
that
created
what
is
called
a
right
of
deduction
fund.
the
right
of
deduction
fund
was
made
up
out
of
royalties
paid
by
the
particular
lessee
and
credited
to
it
and
used
to
pay
return
charges.
now
as
to
shoe
machinery
makers,
judge
wyzanski
said
this
is
a
restrictive.
it
keeps
out
competitors,
but
as
to
shoe
manufacturers
like
hanover,
it
is
a
benefit
and
the
10-year
term
never
affected
it.
hanover
testified
at
page
301
of
the
record
that
it
never
had
to
pay
a
return
charge
for
this
reason.
second,
the
free
repair
service
is
charged
as
a
restrictive
practice
that
kept
out
shoe
machinery
makers,
but
as
to
hanover,
it
was
a
benefit
because
the
lessees
required
hanover
to
repair
the
machines
at
its
own
expense
and
united
did
it
at
its
expense.
and
while
the
court
found
that
hanover
paid
for
this
service
in
paying
lease
charges,
the
court
also
found
that
this
lease
charges
were
reasonable
and
i
cite
pages
51,
61,
100
and
189
of
the
joint
appendix.
third,
the
full
capacity
clause,
which
was
held
that
the
restrictive
devices
against
competitors,
mr.
sheppard
of
hanover
testified
it
was
never
enforced
against
him.
and
fourth,
the
return
charges
on
the
return
of
the
machines,
they
were
never
paid
by
hanover
because
of
its
continuing
credit
in
this
voluntarily
created
right
of
deduction
fund.
so
as
regards
the
impact
of
our
contention
on
any
other
treble-damage
cases
that
may
come
before
the
court,
we
say
that
giving
full
effect
to
the
adjudication
that
judge
wyzanski
made,
hanover
didn't
try
to
bring
itself
within
it
and
in
other
cases,
the
violation
is
found
for
the
past
but
of
course
people
injured
would
be
entitled
to
claim
on
the
injury.
but
there
again,
i
think
your
honors
would
be
interested
in
the
fact
that
not
only
did
hanover
never
complained
of
being
unable
to
buy
until
this
suit
was
filed
in
september
1955,
but
hanover
expressed
positive
satisfaction
with
the
leasing
system.
as
it
chanced,
the
defendant
brought
before
judge
wyzanski
on
his
trial,
a
number
of
shoe
manufacturers
testified
that
the
satisfactory
character
of
the
lease
only
system
without
particular
regard
to
these
four
objectionable
clauses
but
whether
they
would
prefer
to
buy
rather
than
to
lease.
and
somewhat
to
the
disbelief
of
judge
wyzanski,
all
the
13
whose
testimony
is
cited
at
page
14
of
our
main
brief
in
number
463,
all
13
who
were
produced,
testified,
no
they
like
leasing,
they
would
rather
lease
than
buy.
of
course
a
great
advantage
of
leasing
your
honors
is
that
it
puts
all
this
competitors
at
the
same
footing.
the
charges
are
uniform
and
above
all
as
judge
wyzanski
himself
said,
“small
companies
like
hanover
that
are
beginning,
have
no
capital,
can
get
full
equipment
of
machinery
by
just
paying
the
monthly
charge”.
now,
mr.
sheppard,
president
of
hanover,
was
going
to
be
asked
to
testify
among
those
people.
as
it
happened,
he
was
not
called.
the
testimony
was
getting
accumulated,
but
the
record
is
very
clear
as
to
what
he
said
in
an
interview
which
my
senior
partner
mr.
kendall
had
with
him
sheppard
in
1950
concerning
the
leasing
system.
i
cite
the
record
page
335,
mr.
sheppard
was
very
pro
united
shoe
and
the
only
thing
about
the
leases
which
he
did
not
like
was
the
fact
that
it
allowed
competition
to
hurt
him.
he
said
the
only
objection
i
have
to
leasing
is
the
fact
that
you
lease
everybody.
he
said
directly
on
the
record
united's
control
of
shoe
manufacturers
is
a
lot
of
nonsense.
he
said
quoted
by
a
person
at
the
interview,
“his
big
objection
against
the
leasing
system
was
that
it
caused
too
many
competitors
for
his
company.”
so
carrying
this
story
which
i
have
endeavored,
treat
chronologically,
down
to
1953,
you
have
a
situation
where
hanover
had
prospered
in
the
use
of
the
leases,
had
never
claimed
the
right
to
purchase
and
was
not
in
fact
affected
as
the
direct
object
of
the
monopoly
which
monopoly
was
directed
against
united's
competitors.
certainly
normal
that
the
monopolization
giving
united
a
control
of
the
shoe
machinery
market
would
exclude
shoe
machinery
manufacturers.
now,
the
fact
the
other
competitors
like
the
campbell
shoe
machinery
and
other
producers,
leased
their
machines
exclusively,
that
leasing
was
traditional
in
the
business,
that
it
had
been
going
on
since
the
civil
war.
all
that
of
course
did
not
save
united
from
the
restrictive
effects
of
these
four
clauses
which
kept
out
the
competitors,
but
these
four
clauses
did
not
affect
hanover.
now,
i
must
hurry
on
and
i
think
perhaps
i
had
better
get
for
just
a
moment
to
passing
on
since
mr.
hayes
mentioned
it.
i
thought
i
might
leave
it
to
the
briefs
because
it
is
after
all
largely
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
cases,
but
i
think
i
can
sum
up
by
saying
the
word
injury
in
the
clayton
act
has
been
treated
differently
by
different
courts
with
respect
to
whether
the
plaintiff
is
a
middle
man
or
a
consumer
of
the
product.
it
is
a
middle
man,
the
court
still
say
in
the
cases
that
are
cited,
is
passing
on
the
alleged
excess
cost
gives
him
no
cause
of
action,
but
it
is
the
consumer
who
uses
shoe
machinery
then
says
the
court
said
it's
different.
even
though
he
passed
on
the
excess
cost,
he
is
still
injured
because
as
mr.
hayes
reminds
you
the
theory
of
justice
holmes
in
a
railroad
and
not
an
antitrust
case
is
the
first
impact
is
what
counts.
that
does
not
seem
logical
and
it
does
not
seem
to
be
consonant.
with
your
honors'
decision
in
the
amec
case
cited
in
our
brief,
a
tax
case
that
where
plaintiff
has
transferred
the
obligation
he
undertook,
he
no
longer
has
a
cause
of
action.
but
as
the
cases
now
shaped,
the
passing
on
defense
is
very
different
from
it
has
been
in
any
other
case
before.
because
the
courts
below
did
hold
despite
what
mr.
hayes
said
and
our
brief
gives
the
references
that
the
lease
terms
and
rental
rates
between
the
parties
were
reasonable.
the
district
court
refused
to
find
them
unreasonable
and
in
other
comments,
the
district
court
said
granted
that
they
are
reasonable
and
leases
are
lawful
the
defendant
is
still
liable.
the
leases
then
were
alright.
they
are
not
objectionable.
it's
inability
to
but
that
is
objectionable.
now,
when
you
come
to
the
inability
to
buy,
what
the
plaintiff
has
done
is
to
total
up,
to
fabricate,
to
total
up
the
so
called
purchase
price.
that
purchase
price
certainly
could
not
be
asserted
before
1955
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
in
fact
it
was
only
calculated
in
1961.
that
perhaps
makes
no
difference,
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
year
after
year
during
the
16
years
of
this
alleged
violation,
hanover
not
only
was
making
up
profit
year
by
year
after
paying
the
$0.8
of
per
lease
charges.
but
according
to
a
stipulation
that
is
in
the
record
and
cited
in
our
brief,
in
making
this
profit,
it
calculated
the
cost
in
which
it
put
in
the
cost
of
shoe
machinery
so
that
by
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
hanover
had
been
completely
paid.
this
is
the
first
time
passing
on
has
come
before
this
court
since
justice
brandeis
intimated
in
the
kiel
case
back
in
1922
that
it
might
be
valid
defense
and
that
was
an
antitrust
case,
cited
in
our
briefs.
i
think
it
is
high
time
if
this
issue
comes
to
be
determinated
that
the
court
recognize
the
equity
of
not
allowing
a
satisfied
lessee
who
has
been
indemnified
out
of
his
resale
prices
to
victimize
the
defendant
with
a
treble-damage
charge
which
is
not
an
injury
because
at
the
time
of
the
lease
payments
the
transactions
were
lawful
according
to
the
courts
below.
another
point
which
is
dealt
with
a
great
deal
in
the
briefs,
but
i
believe
i
now
have
a
shorter
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
your
honor,
you
are
welcome.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no.
it
is
true
you
could
day
and
let
us
say
that
on
a
certain
machine
clicker
they
may
even
have
$5
a
month,
suppose
there
were
$4,
hanover
would
have
paid
$4
instead
of
$5
bit
remember
all
competitors
would
too.
and
what
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
in
the
kiel
case
if
they
are
all
treated
alike
and
they
all
get
the
benefit
of
the
same
change
and
they
are
competing
with
each
other
not
with
the
united,
who
can
decide
that
it
would
make
any
difference.
of
course
judge
goodrich
says
maybe
they
could
have
bought
more
leather.
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
connected
proposition.
what
i
was
coming,
i
don't
know
if
i
have
answered
your
honor's
question,
what
i
was
coming
to
say
was
to
simplify
the
calculating
--
the
damage
calculation
point.
i
think
mr.
hayes
has
given
me
the
opening
that
i
require.
i
cannot
of
course
involve
this
court
in
the
details
of
an
elaborate
calculation
the
district
court
went
through.
hanover
has
attached
as
an
appendix
to
its
brief
the
written
description
by
judge
sheridan
who
was
certainly
very
patient
about
the
matter
as
to
how
he
saw
the
damage
calculations.
now,
this
written
description,
i
criticize
in
two
particulars
that
i
have
already
adverted
to
and
that
i
recall
to
your
honors
as
determinating,
the
tax
benefit
of
the
lease
payments
actually
made
and
the
cost
of
capital
consideration.
now
the
cost
of
capital
is
defined
by
the
district
court
as
the
rate
of
return
which
investors
expect
on
the
money
they
put
in
the
company.
and
the
conception
is
that
if
hanover
spends
a
million
dollars
buying
shoe
machinery,
it's
a
lost
of
money
unless
it
makes
out
of
that
shoe
machinery
what
the
return
has
to
be
put
to
investors
on
the
million
dollars
that
they
have
put
in.
the
concept
is
described
abundantly
in
the
record.
the
only
thing
that
both
judge
sheridan
and
mr.
hayes
have
criticized
about
it
is
what
i
freely
admit
that
the
cost
of
capital
could
be
computed
different
ways.
but
that
there
is
such
an
item
as
cost
of
capital
to
be
taken
into
account
in
a
fair
comparison
your
honors
of
leasing
versus
ownership
is
agreed
by
both
sides.
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
what
the
briefs
should
bring
out
that
when
hanover
purchased
used
shoe
machinery
from
united
pursuant
to
the
decree
and
the
prices
of
this
machinery
were
worked
out
in
negotiations
between
shoe
manufacturers
as
a
group
and
united.
each
side
had
an
economist
dr.
joel
dean
and
dr.
robert
anthony,
and
each
economist
said,
“in
reaching
this
price,
we
have
got
to
compute
the
cost
of
capital
for
the
entire
group”.
dean
said
it
was
10%.
anthony
said
it
was
18%.
i
only
cite
this
to
illustrate
that
it
is
an
item
that
exists.
and
if
you're
going
to
look
at
purchase
versus
lease
contemporaneously
when
hanover
had
to
make
the
decision
which
i
would
say
is
the
only
fair
way
to
look
at
it,
you
would
have
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
the
decisions
were
supposititiously
made
that
is
39,
40,
41
and
so
on
when
hanover
actually
leased,
but
now
it
says,
it
would
have
liked
to
buy.
now
as
it
happens,
the
arithmetical
consequences
of
the
two
methods
are
laid
out
clearly
in
exhibits
before
the
court.
there
are
three
or
four
of
these
great
exhibits
so
called
the
lightest
of
calculations
made
by
statisticians
on
assumptions
of
counsel.
they
omit
taxes
and
cost
of
capital.
and
there
are
on
the
other
side,
our
calculations
which
include
them
and
those
are
exhibits
48,
51
and
52.
only
the
first
two,
i
am
sorry
to
say,
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
the
allowance
for
these
two
items
on
the
basis
of
contemporaneous
choice
shows
uncontestably
that
purchase
would
have
cost
$949,000
more
than
leasing
did.
and
that
of
course
is
why
as
i
would
assume,
hanover
was
content
to
lease.
now
this
approach
does
not
rest
exclusively
on
my
i
say
so
as
an
advocate.
i
cite
the
statement
of
hanover's
expert
at
page
562
of
the
record
where
he
said
“is
it
your
point
that
the
lightest
of
calculations
and
those
are
the
plaintiff's
calculations
omitting
cost
of
capital,
etcetera,
the
lightest
of
calculations
were
not
documents
which
would
be
presented
to
management
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
buy
or
to
lease”.
“oh,
definitely
not”
he
says.
on
the
other
hand,
he
says
that
what
we
have
computed
with
the
allowance
of
these
factors
at
page
561
is
basically
the
kind
of
thing
that
one
would
present
to
management
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
buy
or
to
lease
and
he
says
elsewhere
at
page
547
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
fortas
to
taxes
in
this
context.
this
is
the
plaintiffs'
expert
richard
m.
syrt,
i
would
heartily
endorse
the
notion
of
introducing
taxes
on
making
a
decision
on
preparing
data
for
management
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
they
should
purchase
or
not.
so
here
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
issue
that
the
court
has
to
decide
in
balancing
these
enormous
amounts
of
money
and
these
recounted
calculations,
it
is
a
simple
common
sense
question
in
deciding
the
equities
between
the
parties
as
to
relative
costs
of
the
two
methods.
do
you
look
at
it
at
the
time
when
the
plaintiff
deprived
of
the
right
to
purchase,
wanted
to
purchase
and
could
not
which
we
say
or
do
you
look
at
it
in
a
way
which
mr.
hayes
persuaded
the
district
court
to
err
by
miracle
of
advocacy,
taking
this
great
volumes
saying
these
are
the
assumed
cost
of
purchase,
tell
me
whether
or
not
the
cost
of
capital
and
taxes
should
go
into
those.
and
the
expert
says
“oh
no
of
course
you
can't
do
it
backwards.
you
can't
do
it
backwards,
if
you
made
the
decision
leaving
them
out.”
well
says
dr.
syrt,
“i
am
not
going
to
put
them
in”.
now
that
as
i
would
perhaps
emphasize
i
perhaps
summed
up
all
too
briefly
is
where
the
case
stands
on
damages
and
i
think
a
gross
injustice
has
been
done
by
leaving
out
these
prime
economic
factors
built
into
the
question
of
purchase,
but
perhaps
even
the
worst
thing
that
is
not
really
mentioned
in
our
brief
because
we
had
too
much
to
talk
about
is
what
your
honors
are
constantly
familiar
with
on
installment
sales,
this
plaintiff
has
added
together
without
discount
for
present
value
all
the
lease
payments
over
16
years.
you
got
a
total
and
he
has
compared
it
with
a
single
purchase
price.
of
course
everybody
knows
that
one
purchase
is
cheaper
than
16
time
payments
in
point
of
adding
gross
dollars.
but
the
discount
for
present
value
is
what
brings
it
back
to
a
fair
comparative
status.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
none,
none.
on
what
i
have
just
said
your
honor
a
part
from
all
other
factors,
lack
of
demand
and
so
on
the
inability
to
purchase
cost
hanover
nothing
and
if
it
had
bought,
it
would
have
been
$900,000
more
costly.
so
there
are
no
damages.
and
i
would
not
of
course
it
seems
to
me
from
where
i
stand,
be
at
all
affronted
by
the
possibility
that
an
antitrust
violator
has
in
given
case
created
no
damage.
i
seem
to
find
in
the
commentators
and
occasionally
--
in
the
judicial
opinions
the
suggestion
that
where
a
monopoly
is
found
we
have
got
to
find
someone
to
punish
and
the
plaintiff,
whoever
comes
into
court
with
a
statutory
counsel
fee
he
is
the
private
attorney
general
who
administers
the
punishment.
i
do
not
think
the
vindication
of
majesty
of
the
law
rests
solely
on
private
plaintiffs
or
rests
on
any
important
particular.
if
the
government
failed
in
a
criminal
indictment
in
1913
on
the
judgment
of
your
honors'
predecessors,
if
the
government
failed
in
the
bill
of
equity
in
1923,
was
it,
on
the
decision
of
the
court
at
that
time.
and
if
the
clayton
act
violations
were
repaired
as
they
were
in
the
third
case
then
i
do
not
think
that
when
united
comes
to
a
judgment
that
on
a
new
development
in
the
law
due
to
the
american
tobacco
case,
there
is
a
correction
that
must
be
made
and
there
is
a
violation.
i
do
not
think
it
inheres
in
the
angel
of
justice
to
find
some
private
person
who
is
got
to
make
money
out
of
it.
judge
wyzanski
cured
the
errors,
the
violations.
he
laid
down
a
strict
decree
and
in
the
case
number
597
that
have
come
before
your
honors
at
the
end
of
the
month,
you
will
find
that
decree
has
been
scrupulously
complied
with.
now
that
is
the
form
of
redress
that
majesty
of
the
law.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
a
congressional
direction
what
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes
sir.
i
fully
accede
and
realize
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
in
some
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
with
difference,
i
should
not
myself
feel
that
was
so.
i
am
of
course
speaking
only
on
this
record
and
in
relation
to
the
rights
of
my
client
and
the
facts
of
this
case
but
i
would
not
assume
--
i
would
not
think
that
because
lease
only,
the
inability
to
buy
was
not
condemned
by
judge
wyzanski
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
hanover
on
that
ground
among
others
had
no
standing.
i
would
not
think
that
for
that
reason
all
other
plaintiffs
are
out
of
court.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
am
under
some
handicap
if
i'm
obliged
to
answer
with
respect
to
a
state
of
fact
in
your
honors
mind
but
not
my
own.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
do
not
say
in
vacuum.
i
say
in
context
to
the
law
and
with
a
strict
adherence
to
the
decision
which
is
relied
on
under
the
clayton
act
as
the
basis
of
this
recovery.
now
this
comes
germane
to
whatever
i
was
next
going
to
say.
excuse
me
sir,
if
i
attempted
to
answer
your
honors
point,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
dealt
with
it
all.
you
have
warned
me
that
i
must
not
claim
too
much.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
have
responded
the
best
way
i
can.
let
me
look
the
particular
point
which
is
here.
under
the
rule
of
the
amec
case
in
clayton
act,
section
4,
it
is
the
decree
in
the
underlying
government
case
that
has
the
effect
of
an
estoppel
and
an
estoppel
only
so
far
as
the
decree
goes
and
one
of
the
differences
between
mr.
hayes
and
myself
is
how
far
the
decree
goes
and
our
brief
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
say
not
only
does
judge
wyzanski
not
condemned
lease
only
by
itself,
but
this
court
had
approved
lease
only
up
until
1953
or
1954
when
you
affirmed
judge
wyzanski.
and
judge
wyzanski
himself
thought
that
you
had
approved
it
and
judge
wyzanski
dismissed
the
clause
in
the
government's
complaint
paragraph
61
which
attacked
the
refusal
to
sell,
but
i
go
further.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
judge
sheridan's
interpretation
of
the
decree
was
so
different
not
only
from
our
own,
but
from
that
of
another
district
judge,
judge
berk
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
the
coon
case,
the
complaint
is
a
copy
of
the
hanover
complaint.
in
view
of
that,
we
asked
judge
wyzanski
in
exercise
of
his
reserved
jurisdiction
of
the
government
case
to
amend
or
interpret
his
own
decree.
hanover
appeared
and
opposed
and
the
government
counsel,
being
the
government
case
appeared.
judge
wyzanski
in
difference
to
judge
sheridan
refused
to
interfere
on
account
of
comity
of
coordinate
courts.
but
he
said,
have
you
not
considered
the
practice
that
the
supreme
court
approves
in
erie
against
tompkins
case
of
certifying
the
question
from
the
treble
damage
court
to
the
antitrust
court.
in
the
course
of
that
colloquy,
judge
wyzanski
had
before
him
as
i
said
government
counsel
and
the
interesting
colloquy
which
he
had
with
government
counsel
appears
on
pages
19
and
21
of
our
brief
and
it
is
in
the
record
and
not
to
read
too
long
because
you
have
it
all
before
you,
judge
wyzanski
made
this
arresting
remark
addressed
to
government
counsel
who
under
the
rule
of
the
amec
case
was
the
party
entitled
to
enforce
the
estoppel
that
hanover
would
enforce.
the
judge
said
at
page
20
“now
that
you
are
here,
are
you
not
aware
from
being
here
on
previous
occasions
that
the
government
never
contended
and
i
never
ruled
as
judge
sheridan
supposes
the
matter
was
decided.”
that
was
a
clear
information
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
a
clear
information
that
judge
wyzanski
thought
that
judge
sheridan
was
wrong
in
interpreting
the
decree
and
decision
of
judge
wyzanski.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
particularly
since
we
tried
to
implement
it.
we
did
not
think
we
have
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
is
the
binding
construction
because
judge
sheridan
made
a
construction.
we
said
we
tried
to
implement
it
by
asking
for
a
reference
and
certification
of
questions
such
as
your
honors'
approved
in
the
national
gypsum
case
to
avoid
multiple
and
conflicting
decisions.
and
judge
sheridan
for
reason
still
not
clear
to
me
refused
to
depart
from
the
decision
that
he
had
made
which
was
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there's
much
merit
in
united's
construction
of
this
language
and
much
merit
in
united's
statement
that
the
decree
of
wyzanski
did
not
hit
lease
only.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
unfortunately
the
application
is
not
timely.
the
application
was
made
by
us
as
soon
as
we
could
after
judge
sheridan
rendered
his
decision
and
before
judgment.
and
there
is
authority
in
the
books
that
when
you
do
have
a
proper
reference
question
it's
fit
and
proper
to
first
take
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
because
it
may
well
be
that
it
would
be
superfluous
to
go
to
a
reference
if
on
other
grounds
the
case
goes
off
another
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
felt
and
said
that
our
position
had
much
merit
let
us
say,
but
for
reasons
that
are
not
clear
to
me,
it
could
not
take,
accept
our
argument
even
though
directed
to
the
maintenance
of
a
just
result
in
a
basic
feature
of
the
case
which
is
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
government
decree.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
we
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
at
the
tax
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
i
do
think
so.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
there
was
none.
we
made
a
new
motion
for
new
trial
under
the
rule
and
i
attached
that
and
it
was
a
subject
of
discussion
before
judge
sheridan.
now
that
this
is
a
basic
point
and
the
meaning
of
the
decree
is
so
vital
and
$5
million
turns
on
it
and
the
case
had
lasted
in
the
district
court
for
years
and
years.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
not
unless
he
is
invited
to
by
the
court
having
jurisdiction.
now
i
have
not
had
time
to
emphasize
the
lack
of
demand
and
inadequacy
of
the
finding
that
hanover
would
have
bought
machines.
that
is
basic
to
the
whole
the
case
and
all
the
district
judge
said,
is
it
likely
would
have
bought
machine.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
your
affirmance
was
a
per
curiam.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
it
affirmed
what
he
found
and
what
he
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
is
indeed.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
of
course
you
may
and
i
think
you
should
take
into
account
in
doing
so,
but
i
refer
to
my
brief
where
counsel
for
the
government
said
lease
only
was
not
attacked
on
the
appeal.
thank
you.
