mr.
stern?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
is
that
precisely
the
same
issue
we
had
here
in
united
states
against
the
embassy
restaurant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not
believe
it's
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
differences
between
the
$4
and
the
$8?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
on
the
record
or
is
that
written
for
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
an
argument
for
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
we
all
know.
maybe
the
counsel
will
say
whether
he
has
any
objection
to
it
and
not
to
--
chief

warren
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
embassy,
if
a
man
was
in
the
industry
for
four
years
under
this
agreement,
let's
say
and
he
either
quit
or
was
fired
from
his
employment
and
went
out
of
the
industry,
what
was
he
entitled
to
receive
under
that
contract?
chief
justice
earl
warren
embassy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
after
he
leaves,
is
he
entitled
to
anything
if
he
gets
out
and
leaves
the
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
now
what
is
he
entitled
to
under
this
contract
if
he
is
fired
and
leaves
the
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
benefits
is
he
entitled
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
he
entitled
to
$60
a
month?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
anyway,
it
depends
on
how
much
he
put
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
long
do
those
payments
exist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
he
entitled
to
get
the
return
of
the
total
amount
that
he
put
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
well
isn't
that
a
great
variation
from
embassy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
automation
itself
brings
about
attrition
doesn't
it
in
employments
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
the
question
as
to
bargaining
on
wages
and
working
conditions,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
more
immediate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
bills
in
the
congress
specifically
to
overrule
the
embassy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
limited
to
that
or
would
that
just
be
included
in
a
broad
provision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
pension
funds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
embrace
it
but
it
wasn't
directly
specifically
toward
embassy
as
it
was
decided,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
