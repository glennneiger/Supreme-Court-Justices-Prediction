justice
abe
fortas
do
you
remember
whether
the
life
insurance
was
a
term
insurance
or
was
it
straight
life?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
term
insurance,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
man
worked
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
man
works
for
the
company
for
three
to
four
years
and
then
he
is
discharged
or
he
resigns
not
to
retire
from
the
industry
but
go
to
work
for
another
company,
is
he
entitled
to
any
of
these
funds?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
suppose
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
just
be
careful,
if
you
were
because
i
want
to
be
precise
about
this
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
suppose
he
goes
to
another
--
he
resigns
from
the
company
in
which
he
is
employed.
he
goes
to
another
company,
in
the
electrical
industry
that
is
not
covered
by
this
agreement
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
suppose
he
is
discharged
by
the
company
at
the
end
of
let's
say
three
or
four
years,
what
happens
then?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
leaves
the
industry
first?
justice
abe
fortas
so
discharge
and
voluntary
resignation
from
the
same
company
are
treated
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
minimum
period
during
which
he
has
to
work
for
the
company
or
under
this
industry
wide
agreement
before
he
is
entitled
to
receive
payments
from
the
company?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
he
retires
from
the
industry,
let's
say
at
the
end
of
six
months,
then
he
is
entitled
to
what
has
been
accumulated?
justice
abe
fortas
well
here,
don't
you
have
a
difference
here
that
this
--
there's
a
very
close
resemblance
to
wages
in
the
sense
that
there
was
$4
per
day.
and
i
note
that
in
your
brief
you
talked
about
the
possibility
that
some
workman
may
be
favored
over
others,
but
if
all
of
them
get
the
credit
of
the
additional
$4
a
day,
doesn't
that
put
the
matter
in
a
different
light?
in
embassy,
the
situation
was
different
in
the
sense
that
there's
no
money
that
was
credited
to
the
account
of
the
individual
workers
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well
this
provision
in
embassy
are
these
--
there
are
these
words
in
embassy?
let
us
examine
the
nature
of
these
contributions.
it
reflects
on
some
$8
per
month
for
each
workman.
the
amount
is
without
relation
to
his
hours,
workers,
wages
or
productivity,
it
is
due
to
the
trustees
not
the
workman
and
the
latter
has
no
legal
interest
in
it
whatever.
a
workman
cannot
even
compel
payment
by
defaulting
employer.
in
other
words,
that
looks
as
a
--
reads
as
if
the
court
was
quite
concerned
with
the
particulars
of
the
arrangement?
justice
abe
fortas
and
just
before
that
though
the
sentence
says
“the
contributions
here
are
not
due
to
workman
nor
have
they,
the
customary
attributes
of
wages”.
do
you
think
that's
equally
true
of
the
$4
a
day
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
from
here,
is
it
your
position
that
the
$600
limitation
per
workman,
per
claimant
as
excess
will
have
no
application
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
you
have
the
trustee
of
the
fund
who
is
claiming
the
amounts
due
under
the
--
due
to
the
fund,
in
fact
due
to
workman
payable
to
the
fund.
now,
what
you
would
actually
have
then
would
be
that
you
take
the
wages
due
to
a
particular
work
and
compute
those
which
are
entitled
to
the
second
priority.
if
those
were
under
$600,
you
would
have
the
amount
to
be
credited
to
that
workman
up
to
$600,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
am
wasn't
talking
about
satisfying
now.
i'm
talking
about
how
much
would
be
allowed
as
a
second
priority.
let's
take
workman
pay
and
he
has
a
claim
for
wages
in
the
amount
of
$500
dollars,
which
is
entitled
to
second
priority.
let
us
assume
that
the
trustee
has
a
claim
for
money
to
be
credited
to
workman
pay
in
the
amount
of
$200.
now,
the
total
amount
that
would
be
given
a
class
2
priority
would
be
$600,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
do
have
an
automatic
limitation
on
the
aggregate
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
assuming
that
this
estate
were
not
adequate
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
the
second
priorities?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
you're
making
a
distinction
between
what
goes
to
the
workman
direct
and
what
goes
to
the
workman
plus
trustees
of
the
fund.
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
my
confusion
because
you
were
saying
siphoning
off
and
that's
a
word
that
may
mean
transfer
from
one
pocket
to
another
pocket
that
they
can't
get
in
to
quite
as
fast.
that's
what
siphoning
--
justice

do
you
remember
whether
the
life
insurance
