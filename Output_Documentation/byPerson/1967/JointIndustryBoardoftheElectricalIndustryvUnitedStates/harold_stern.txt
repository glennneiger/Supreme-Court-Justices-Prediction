mr.
harold
stern
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
is
here
pursuant
to
a
petition
for
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
on
december
6th
--
december
4th,
1967.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
payments
made
by
employers
to
the
annuity
fund
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
payments
are
earmarked
for
the
employees
of
the
contributing
employers
and
credited
to
their
respective
accounts
and
establish
fixed
vested
interests
for
those
employees,
constitute
wages
within
the
meaning
of
section
64a
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
harold
stern
i
don't
believe
it's
the
same
case
--
mr.
harold
stern
i
think
it's
--
very
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
wants
to
review
the
embassy
case.
i'm
representing
the
annuity
plan
here.
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
are
a
little
different
from
the
embassy
case
and
that's
what
i
intend
to
argue.
i
think,
from
my
argument
and
as
a
general
principle
and
from
the
developments
of
pension
funds,
which
during
the
last
10
years
after
the
decision
of
the
embassy
case
have
fixed
vested
rights
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes.
mr.
harold
stern
vested
rights
and
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes.
now,
in
this
case,
the
a
&
s
electric
company
filed
an
arrangement
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
chapter
xi
proceeding
and
was
subsequently
adjudicated
a
bankrupt.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
joint
industry
board
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
supervises
all
of
the
various
trust
funds,
filed
a
claim
on
behalf
of
several
trust
funds.
one
was
the
welfare
and
pension
fund
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
was
welfare
and
pension
fund
as
distinguished
from
the
annuity
plan
in
this
case.
another
was
a
vacation
fund;
another
was
the
employees'
disability
fund
where
the
employee
was
to
contribute
for
the
state
disability;
and
a
number
of
others,
including
the
annuity
fund.
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
was
some
$10,000
but
the
payment
to
the
annuity
plan
amounted
to
$5114
and
covered
some
40
employees
who
are
employed
there
to
whom
moneys
were
owed.
and
this
annuity
plan
was
established
your
honors
in
1954.
it
is
a
plan
which
was
unique
at
that
time.
a
simple
plan
but
there
wasn't
a
similar
plan
in
existence.
what
happened
when
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated,
your
honors,
was
that
the
union
in
negotiating
an
agreement
requested
that
an
annuity
plan
should
be
established
and
instead
of
the
wage
rate
being
increased
with
the
result
that
there
would
be
a
withholding
tax
on
the
increased
wages,
deemed
it
advisable
for
the
benefit
of
its
members
to
provide
them
with
security
when
they
retired,
when
they're
permanently
disabled,
if
they
left
the
industry
and
to
the
armed
services
or
in
case
of
death.
so
instead
of
taking
an
increase
in
wages
to
the
extent
of
$4
a
day,
they
agreed
that
this
$4
a
day
should
be
submitted
to
this
annuity
plan
so
that
they
would
save
the
withholding
tax
at
the
time
the
wages
were
paid
and
would
pay
the
taxes
at
a
later
date
when
they
retire
or
in
the
event
of
death,
which
would
be
in
a
much
lower
bracket.
now,
this
is
not
to
be
criticized
as
the
plan.
it's
a
very
laudable
situation.
this
plan
was
approved
by
the
treasury
department
of
the
united
states.
this
government
--
this
country
has
been
thinking
in
terms
of
security
for
people
so
that
they
do
not
become
the
subjects
of
charity
in
case
of
death
or
disability
or
upon
retirement,
and
the
thought
was
that
these
fixed
interests,
when
the
man
retired,
should
supplement
his
regular
pension
which
he
received
from
the
pension
plan.
in
case
he
became
disabled
that
he
should
have
relief.
in
case
he
left
the
industry,
he
should
have
relief.
in
case
of
death,
then
in
addition
to
the
moneys
which
was
credited
to
his
account,
the
equity,
a
sum
would
be
paid
of
a
$125
a
month
to
the
widow
who
was
usually
the
designated
beneficiary
until
the
equity
was
entirely
paid.
and
in
addition
thereto,
there
would
be
approximately
$5,000
in
death
benefit
paid
to
over
a
$125
a
month
which
$5,000
death
benefit
was
earned
from
the
investment
of
the
payments
made
by
the
employers
and
which
would
be
invested
in
earned
income.
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
moneys
that
were
on
deposit,
there
would
be
interest
credited
which
has
been
done
over
the
last
several
years.
now,
in
this
case,
we
claim
that
this
case
is
different
and
can
be
distinguished
from
the
embassy
case
on
this
ground.
in
the
embassy
case,
the
payment
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
life
insurance,
medical
benefits
and
surgical
benefits,
which
were
all
contingent
on
the
happening
of
an
event.
mr.
harold
stern
no,
it
was
group
life
insurance
i
believe.
mr.
harold
stern
yes,
and
that
was
all
contingent.
if
a
man
left
the
industry,
he
would
have
no
interest
in
the
life
--
he
had
no
benefit
on
the
life
insurance.
if
he
didn't
become
sick
or
needed
no
surgical
benefit,
he
received
no
benefit
from
it.
this
case
is
entirely
different.
this
is
$4
a
day
instead
of
wages.
it's
fixed
in
a
man's
account.
it
must
be
paid
to
him
whether
he
retires,
whether
he
is
disabled,
whether
he
leaves
the
industry,
whether
he
dies.
secondly,
in
the
embassy
case,
this
court
spoke
in
terms
that
i
think
it
was
$8
a
month
was
paid
for
each
workmen,
and
the
court
stated,
it
had
no
relation
to
the
production
or
times
or
conditions
of
employment.
in
this
case,
the
$4
a
day
is
a
time
and
condition
of
employment.
the
$4
a
day
is
paid
when
and
only
if
the
man
works
and
produces
a
days
work.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
same
situation
as
if
it
were
$4
an
hour
or
$5
an
hour
plus
$4
away
a
day,
which
are
his
wages.
mr.
harold
stern
the
$8
is
merely
a
sum
which
is
paid
to
workmen.
a
workman
may
be
employed
by
a
company
and
may
not
work
half
the
time
because
he's
sick.
he
is
still
--
they
would
still
make
the
payment
to
him
of
that
$8
a
month.
in
the
$4
a
day,
he
doesn't
work
any
day,
there's
no
money
paid
on
his
behalf.
mr.
harold
stern
your
honor,
if
he
goes
to
work
for
another
company
that
is
covered
by
this
agreement
--
mr.
harold
stern
if
he's
not,
if
he
isn't
covered
by
this
agreement,
you
mean
another
company,
he
is
entitled
to
receive
moneys
at
the
rate
of
$60
a
month.
mr.
harold
stern
he
would
receive
$60
a
month
just
the
same
as
if
he
went
into
business
for
himself.
mr.
harold
stern
and
he
leaves
the
industry?
mr.
harold
stern
if
he
leaves
the
industry,
the
money
is
credited
to
his
account
plus
his
accumulated
interest,
which
is
usually
4%
in
the
last
few
years,
would
be
paid
to
him
at
the
rate
of
$60
a
month
until
the
money
is
credited
to
his
account
has
been
exhausted.
mr.
harold
stern
that's
right.
mr.
harold
stern
the
$4
a
day,
which
is
paid
by
the
employer,
is
credited
to
his
account
from
the
first
day
that
he
starts
employment
in
is
earmarked.
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes,
and
i
might
say
that
every
single
month,
and
this
is
not
disputed,
the
annuity
plan
of
the
electrical
industry
sends
to
each
participant
of
the
plan
a
statement
like
a
bankbook
which
shows
how
much
money
he
has
credited
to
his
account
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
statement
contains
likewise
a
crediting
of
the
amount
of
interest
that
has
been
earned
and
the
moneys
deposited
to
his
account.
now,
in
the
embassy
case,
the
court
spoke
about
the
purpose
of
section
64a
(2),
was
to
provided
a
protective
cushion
in
times
of
financial
distress.
of
course,
this
is
not
in
the
statute.
it
was
a
practical
matter.
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
in
case
of
bankruptcy,
before
the
estate
of
a
bankrupt,
estate
is
wound
up
when
the
wages
--
the
priority
wages
are
paid,
it
may
be
a
period
of
a
year
or
two
or
three
may
elapse
till
the
thing
is
wound
up.
now,
i
agree
with
the
court
on
protective
cushion
and
this
is
the
purpose
why
this
plan
was
adopted.
this
provides
a
protective
cushion
to
the
man
who
is
disabled,
the
man
who
has
retired,
the
man
in
the
event
of
his
death
plus
payments
taken.
he
can
never
be
deprived
of
one
cent.
and
when
the
court
spoke
in
the
embassy
case,
and
i
want
to
be
very
frank
about
making
a
payment
to
the
trustees
of
which
mr.
justice
black
dissented,
we
say
here
that
the
trustees
are
merely
the
agents
for
these
people
who
act
on
their
behalf
and
these
people
have
a
vested
interest.
and
if
the
annuity
plan
didn't
pay
them
their
right,
they
will
have
a
right
to
go
into
court
under
the
decisions
and
collect
the
moneys
due
them
under
the
provisions
of
the
plan.
the
cases
covering
this
point
are
in
my
brief
and
i
won't
argue
before
the
court.
now,
i
do
want
to
spend
a
minute
on
the
question
that
in
a
case
decided
after
the
embassy
case
by
this
court
in
1962
in
the
sulmeyer
against
southern
california
pipe
trades
company
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
“that
moneys
contributed
to
a
vacation
and
holiday
fund,
and
earmarked
for
the
benefit
of
the
participants,
constituted
wages
within
the
meaning
of
section
64(2)(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act”.
the
court
in
that
case,
despite
the
embassy
case,
distinguished
it
and
held
that
they
were
entitled
to
priority.
the
government
would
distinguish
that
case
on
the
ground
that
in
the
sulmeyer
case,
the
withholding
taxes
were
taken
out
when
it
was
paid
when,
your
honors,
the
court
in
the
embassy
case
makes
no
mention
of
withholding
taxes.
the
bankruptcy
act
was
adopted
originally
in
1841
long
before
we
ever
had
any
income
tax.
it
was
within
the
contemplation
of
congress.
secondly,
the
bankruptcy
act
is
not
predicated
on
a
definition
that
it
should
be
given
into
a
priority,
provided
that
withholding
tax
is
not
taken.
nothing
illegal,
nothing
wrong
has
been
done
here.
in
fact,
the
president's
commission
has
commended
the
adoption
of
vested
pension
funds
for
the
protection
of
society
which
is
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
provisions
of
our
social
security
act.
mr.
harold
stern
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
i'll
say
to
that,
i'm
coming
to
that.
i'll
get
to
that
skip
and
bounce
my
argument.
now,
the
government
contends
that
there
were
efforts
in
congress
made
to
amend
section
64a
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
meaning.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
my
contention
that
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
of
this
particular
case,
it's
fixed
vested
interest
which
constitute
wages.
secondly,
under
the
amendments
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
has
been
spoken
about,
they
refer
to
lengthening
and
shortening
the
period
that
it
was
a
bankrupt
to
state,
increasing
or
decreasing
the
amounts
of
the
priorities,
inclusion
of
individuals
who
are
not
prior
included
within
the
bankruptcy
act.
to
say,
distinct
say
point
is
that
the
attempts
which
were
made
in
congress
to
amend
the
bankruptcy
act
refer
in
language
to
all
fringe
benefits
which
could
include
welfare,
pension,
vacation,
annuity
and
a
month
or
two
about
the
fringe
benefits
which
are
far
greater
than
the
situation
in
this
case.
and
in
this
same
connection,
may
i
point
out,
if
you
consider
the
proposed
amendments,
to
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
how
can
one
reconcile
that
with
the
provisions,
with
the
decision
in
the
sulmeyer
case
which
did
grant
the
priority
by
court
of
appeals
and
which
were
related
to
the
fringe
benefit
namely
holiday
and
pension
funds
fairly.
the
next
point,
i'm
going
to
make
on
this
point,
your
honors,
and
i'd
like
to
have
permission
of
the
court
to
submit
a
letter
which
i
received
from
congressman
leonard
foxely
(ph)
who
introduced
all
of
these
bills
in
congress,
which
shows
that
these
bills
were
produced/introduced.
they
weren't
debated.
they
weren't
voted
on.
it
was
a
proforma
act
and
in
his
letter
says,
“he
hopes
in
the
argument
of
this
case,
the
court
will
extend
in
his
language
the
meaning
of
wages
or
interpret
the
meaning
of
wages
to
cover
situation”.
mr.
harold
stern
no,
i
--
mr.
harold
stern
i
said
i
would
ask
the
permission
of
this
court.
i
have
submitted
a
copy
to
my
adversary
and
i
wrote
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
when
i
saw
the
brief
of
the
government.
if
the
court
doesn't
want
me
to
submit
it,
i
won't.
mr.
harold
stern
well,
he
knew
--
he
knew
that
we
would
want
to
submit
it,
but
i'm
just
so
not
submitted,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
time.
mr.
harold
stern
pardon
me?
mr.
harold
stern
i
wrote
a
letter
asking
him
to
give
me
any
information
that
he
could
about
the
presentation
of
bills
in
congress
with
reference
to
legislation
concerning
fringe
benefit
plans.
and
the
reason
i
wrote
the
letter
your
honor
is,
because
i
have
read
the
brief
and
i
refer
it
to
bills
and
i
didn't
know
how
they
came
about
and
so
forth.
certainly,
there
was
no
intention
to
perform
any
act
of
impropriety.
your
honor,
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
claim
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
necessary,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
stern
may
i
just
have
a
minute?
mr.
harold
stern
i
want
to
point
out
that
i
didn't
make
it
clear
that
the
claim
in
this
case
does
not
include
any
wages,
due
wages
to
the
point
that
the
man
didn't
get
paid
his
regular
wages
at
the
end
of
the
month,
but
is
limited
only
to
the
moneys
which
were
due
to
the
annuity
fund.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
and
i
think
it
would
be
merely
theoretical
to
talk
about
$500
or
$300
in
a
building
industry
because
in
a
building
industry,
if
a
man
didn't
receive
his
weekly
pay
at
the
end
of
that
week,
that
would
be
it.
he
wouldn't
work
the
next
week
so
that
be
no
possibility
of
that.
now,
in
this
case,
the
moneys
which
were
due
to
his
account
for
the
annuity
fund
and
the
reason
that
it
became
due
is
because
if
an
employer
don't
pay
money
on
time
to
a
trust
fund
just
like
you
don't
pay
his
taxes
on
time.
the
union
doesn't
act
to
pull
them
in
out
and
put
them
out
of
business
and
that's
how
it
happened.
mr.
harold
stern
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
is
here
pursuant
to
a
petition
for
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
on
december
6th
--
december
4th,
1967.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
payments
made
by
employers
to
the
annuity
fund
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
payments
are
earmarked
for
the
employees
of
the
contributing
employers
and
credited
to
their
respective
accounts
and
establish
fixed
vested
interests
for
those
employees,
constitute
wages
within
the
meaning
of
section
64a
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
harold
stern
i
don't
believe
it's
the
same
case
--
mr.
harold
stern
i
think
it's
--
very
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
wants
to
review
the
embassy
case.
i'm
representing
the
annuity
plan
here.
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
are
a
little
different
from
the
embassy
case
and
that's
what
i
intend
to
argue.
i
think,
from
my
argument
and
as
a
general
principle
and
from
the
developments
of
pension
funds,
which
during
the
last
10
years
after
the
decision
of
the
embassy
case
have
fixed
vested
rights
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes.
mr.
harold
stern
vested
rights
and
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes.
now,
in
this
case,
the
a
&
s
electric
company
filed
an
arrangement
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
chapter
xi
proceeding
and
was
subsequently
adjudicated
a
bankrupt.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
joint
industry
board
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
supervises
all
of
the
various
trust
funds,
filed
a
claim
on
behalf
of
several
trust
funds.
one
was
the
welfare
and
pension
fund
of
the
electrical
industry,
which
was
welfare
and
pension
fund
as
distinguished
from
the
annuity
plan
in
this
case.
another
was
a
vacation
fund;
another
was
the
employees'
disability
fund
where
the
employee
was
to
contribute
for
the
state
disability;
and
a
number
of
others,
including
the
annuity
fund.
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
was
some
$10,000
but
the
payment
to
the
annuity
plan
amounted
to
$5114
and
covered
some
40
employees
who
are
employed
there
to
whom
moneys
were
owed.
and
this
annuity
plan
was
established
your
honors
in
1954.
it
is
a
plan
which
was
unique
at
that
time.
a
simple
plan
but
there
wasn't
a
similar
plan
in
existence.
what
happened
when
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated,
your
honors,
was
that
the
union
in
negotiating
an
agreement
requested
that
an
annuity
plan
should
be
established
and
instead
of
the
wage
rate
being
increased
with
the
result
that
there
would
be
a
withholding
tax
on
the
increased
wages,
deemed
it
advisable
for
the
benefit
of
its
members
to
provide
them
with
security
when
they
retired,
when
they're
permanently
disabled,
if
they
left
the
industry
and
to
the
armed
services
or
in
case
of
death.
so
instead
of
taking
an
increase
in
wages
to
the
extent
of
$4
a
day,
they
agreed
that
this
$4
a
day
should
be
submitted
to
this
annuity
plan
so
that
they
would
save
the
withholding
tax
at
the
time
the
wages
were
paid
and
would
pay
the
taxes
at
a
later
date
when
they
retire
or
in
the
event
of
death,
which
would
be
in
a
much
lower
bracket.
now,
this
is
not
to
be
criticized
as
the
plan.
it's
a
very
laudable
situation.
this
plan
was
approved
by
the
treasury
department
of
the
united
states.
this
government
--
this
country
has
been
thinking
in
terms
of
security
for
people
so
that
they
do
not
become
the
subjects
of
charity
in
case
of
death
or
disability
or
upon
retirement,
and
the
thought
was
that
these
fixed
interests,
when
the
man
retired,
should
supplement
his
regular
pension
which
he
received
from
the
pension
plan.
in
case
he
became
disabled
that
he
should
have
relief.
in
case
he
left
the
industry,
he
should
have
relief.
in
case
of
death,
then
in
addition
to
the
moneys
which
was
credited
to
his
account,
the
equity,
a
sum
would
be
paid
of
a
$125
a
month
to
the
widow
who
was
usually
the
designated
beneficiary
until
the
equity
was
entirely
paid.
and
in
addition
thereto,
there
would
be
approximately
$5,000
in
death
benefit
paid
to
over
a
$125
a
month
which
$5,000
death
benefit
was
earned
from
the
investment
of
the
payments
made
by
the
employers
and
which
would
be
invested
in
earned
income.
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
moneys
that
were
on
deposit,
there
would
be
interest
credited
which
has
been
done
over
the
last
several
years.
now,
in
this
case,
we
claim
that
this
case
is
different
and
can
be
distinguished
from
the
embassy
case
on
this
ground.
in
the
embassy
case,
the
payment
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
life
insurance,
medical
benefits
and
surgical
benefits,
which
were
all
contingent
on
the
happening
of
an
event.
mr.
harold
stern
no,
it
was
group
life
insurance
i
believe.
mr.
harold
stern
yes,
and
that
was
all
contingent.
if
a
man
left
the
industry,
he
would
have
no
interest
in
the
life
--
he
had
no
benefit
on
the
life
insurance.
if
he
didn't
become
sick
or
needed
no
surgical
benefit,
he
received
no
benefit
from
it.
this
case
is
entirely
different.
this
is
$4
a
day
instead
of
wages.
it's
fixed
in
a
man's
account.
it
must
be
paid
to
him
whether
he
retires,
whether
he
is
disabled,
whether
he
leaves
the
industry,
whether
he
dies.
secondly,
in
the
embassy
case,
this
court
spoke
in
terms
that
i
think
it
was
$8
a
month
was
paid
for
each
workmen,
and
the
court
stated,
it
had
no
relation
to
the
production
or
times
or
conditions
of
employment.
in
this
case,
the
$4
a
day
is
a
time
and
condition
of
employment.
the
$4
a
day
is
paid
when
and
only
if
the
man
works
and
produces
a
days
work.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
same
situation
as
if
it
were
$4
an
hour
or
$5
an
hour
plus
$4
away
a
day,
which
are
his
wages.
mr.
harold
stern
the
$8
is
merely
a
sum
which
is
paid
to
workmen.
a
workman
may
be
employed
by
a
company
and
may
not
work
half
the
time
because
he's
sick.
he
is
still
--
they
would
still
make
the
payment
to
him
of
that
$8
a
month.
in
the
$4
a
day,
he
doesn't
work
any
day,
there's
no
money
paid
on
his
behalf.
mr.
harold
stern
your
honor,
if
he
goes
to
work
for
another
company
that
is
covered
by
this
agreement
--
mr.
harold
stern
if
he's
not,
if
he
isn't
covered
by
this
agreement,
you
mean
another
company,
he
is
entitled
to
receive
moneys
at
the
rate
of
$60
a
month.
mr.
harold
stern
he
would
receive
$60
a
month
just
the
same
as
if
he
went
into
business
for
himself.
mr.
harold
stern
and
he
leaves
the
industry?
mr.
harold
stern
if
he
leaves
the
industry,
the
money
is
credited
to
his
account
plus
his
accumulated
interest,
which
is
usually
4%
in
the
last
few
years,
would
be
paid
to
him
at
the
rate
of
$60
a
month
until
the
money
is
credited
to
his
account
has
been
exhausted.
mr.
harold
stern
that's
right.
mr.
harold
stern
the
$4
a
day,
which
is
paid
by
the
employer,
is
credited
to
his
account
from
the
first
day
that
he
starts
employment
in
is
earmarked.
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
harold
stern
yes,
and
i
might
say
that
every
single
month,
and
this
is
not
disputed,
the
annuity
plan
of
the
electrical
industry
sends
to
each
participant
of
the
plan
a
statement
like
a
bankbook
which
shows
how
much
money
he
has
credited
to
his
account
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
statement
contains
likewise
a
crediting
of
the
amount
of
interest
that
has
been
earned
and
the
moneys
deposited
to
his
account.
now,
in
the
embassy
case,
the
court
spoke
about
the
purpose
of
section
64a
(2),
was
to
provided
a
protective
cushion
in
times
of
financial
distress.
of
course,
this
is
not
in
the
statute.
it
was
a
practical
matter.
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
in
case
of
bankruptcy,
before
the
estate
of
a
bankrupt,
estate
is
wound
up
when
the
wages
--
the
priority
wages
are
paid,
it
may
be
a
period
of
a
year
or
two
or
three
may
elapse
till
the
thing
is
wound
up.
now,
i
agree
with
the
court
on
protective
cushion
and
this
is
the
purpose
why
this
plan
was
adopted.
this
provides
a
protective
cushion
to
the
man
who
is
disabled,
the
man
who
has
retired,
the
man
in
the
event
of
his
death
plus
payments
taken.
he
can
never
be
deprived
of
one
cent.
and
when
the
court
spoke
in
the
embassy
case,
and
i
want
to
be
very
frank
about
making
a
payment
to
the
trustees
of
which
mr.
justice
black
dissented,
we
say
here
that
the
trustees
are
merely
the
agents
for
these
people
who
act
on
their
behalf
and
these
people
have
a
vested
interest.
and
if
the
annuity
plan
didn't
pay
them
their
right,
they
will
have
a
right
to
go
into
court
under
the
decisions
and
collect
the
moneys
due
them
under
the
provisions
of
the
plan.
the
cases
covering
this
point
are
in
my
brief
and
i
won't
argue
before
the
court.
now,
i
do
want
to
spend
a
minute
on
the
question
that
in
a
case
decided
after
the
embassy
case
by
this
court
in
1962
in
the
sulmeyer
against
southern
california
pipe
trades
company
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
“that
moneys
contributed
to
a
vacation
and
holiday
fund,
and
earmarked
for
the
benefit
of
the
participants,
constituted
wages
within
the
meaning
of
section
64(2)(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act”.
the
court
in
that
case,
despite
the
embassy
case,
distinguished
it
and
held
that
they
were
entitled
to
priority.
the
government
would
distinguish
that
case
on
the
ground
that
in
the
sulmeyer
case,
the
withholding
taxes
were
taken
out
when
it
was
paid
when,
your
honors,
the
court
in
the
embassy
case
makes
no
mention
of
withholding
taxes.
the
bankruptcy
act
was
adopted
originally
in
1841
long
before
we
ever
had
any
income
tax.
it
was
within
the
contemplation
of
congress.
secondly,
the
bankruptcy
act
is
not
predicated
on
a
definition
that
it
should
be
given
into
a
priority,
provided
that
withholding
tax
is
not
taken.
nothing
illegal,
nothing
wrong
has
been
done
here.
in
fact,
the
president's
commission
has
commended
the
adoption
of
vested
pension
funds
for
the
protection
of
society
which
is
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
provisions
of
our
social
security
act.
mr.
harold
stern
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
i'll
say
to
that,
i'm
coming
to
that.
i'll
get
to
that
skip
and
bounce
my
argument.
now,
the
government
contends
that
there
were
efforts
in
congress
made
to
amend
section
64a
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
meaning.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
my
contention
that
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
of
this
particular
case,
it's
fixed
vested
interest
which
constitute
wages.
secondly,
under
the
amendments
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
has
been
spoken
about,
they
refer
to
lengthening
and
shortening
the
period
that
it
was
a
bankrupt
to
state,
increasing
or
decreasing
the
amounts
of
the
priorities,
inclusion
of
individuals
who
are
not
prior
included
within
the
bankruptcy
act.
to
say,
distinct
say
point
is
that
the
attempts
which
were
made
in
congress
to
amend
the
bankruptcy
act
refer
in
language
to
all
fringe
benefits
which
could
include
welfare,
pension,
vacation,
annuity
and
a
month
or
two
about
the
fringe
benefits
which
are
far
greater
than
the
situation
in
this
case.
and
in
this
same
connection,
may
i
point
out,
if
you
consider
the
proposed
amendments,
to
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
how
can
one
reconcile
that
with
the
provisions,
with
the
decision
in
the
sulmeyer
case
which
did
grant
the
priority
by
court
of
appeals
and
which
were
related
to
the
fringe
benefit
namely
holiday
and
pension
funds
fairly.
the
next
point,
i'm
going
to
make
on
this
point,
your
honors,
and
i'd
like
to
have
permission
of
the
court
to
submit
a
letter
which
i
received
from
congressman
leonard
foxely
(ph)
who
introduced
all
of
these
bills
in
congress,
which
shows
that
these
bills
were
produced/introduced.
they
weren't
debated.
they
weren't
voted
on.
it
was
a
proforma
act
and
in
his
letter
says,
“he
hopes
in
the
argument
of
this
case,
the
court
will
extend
in
his
language
the
meaning
of
wages
or
interpret
the
meaning
of
wages
to
cover
situation”.
mr.
harold
stern
no,
i
--
mr.
harold
stern
i
said
i
would
ask
the
permission
of
this
court.
i
have
submitted
a
copy
to
my
adversary
and
i
wrote
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
when
i
saw
the
brief
of
the
government.
if
the
court
doesn't
want
me
to
submit
it,
i
won't.
mr.
harold
stern
well,
he
knew
--
he
knew
that
we
would
want
to
submit
it,
but
i'm
just
so
not
submitted,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
time.
mr.
harold
stern
pardon
me?
mr.
harold
stern
i
wrote
a
letter
asking
him
to
give
me
any
information
that
he
could
about
the
presentation
of
bills
in
congress
with
reference
to
legislation
concerning
fringe
benefit
plans.
and
the
reason
i
wrote
the
letter
your
honor
is,
because
i
have
read
the
brief
and
i
refer
it
to
bills
and
i
didn't
know
how
they
came
about
and
so
forth.
certainly,
there
was
no
intention
to
perform
any
act
of
impropriety.
your
honor,
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
claim
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
necessary,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
stern
may
i
just
have
a
minute?
mr.
harold
stern
i
want
to
point
out
that
i
didn't
make
it
clear
that
the
claim
in
this
case
does
not
include
any
wages,
due
wages
to
the
point
that
the
man
didn't
get
paid
his
regular
wages
at
the
end
of
the
month,
but
is
limited
only
to
the
moneys
which
were
due
to
the
annuity
fund.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
and
i
think
it
would
be
merely
theoretical
to
talk
about
$500
or
$300
in
a
building
industry
because
in
a
building
industry,
if
a
man
didn't
receive
his
weekly
pay
at
the
end
of
that
week,
that
would
be
it.
he
wouldn't
work
the
next
week
so
that
be
no
possibility
of
that.
now,
in
this
case,
the
moneys
which
were
due
to
his
account
for
the
annuity
fund
and
the
reason
that
it
became
due
is
because
if
an
employer
don't
pay
money
on
time
to
a
trust
fund
just
like
you
don't
pay
his
taxes
on
time.
the
union
doesn't
act
to
pull
them
in
out
and
put
them
out
of
business
and
that's
how
it
happened.
