mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
not
to
loss
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
petitioner
has
a
just
claim
provable
in
bankruptcy,
but
the
issue
is
whether
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
the
petitioner's
claim
priority
over
other
just
claims
that
are
provable
in
bankruptcy.
now
it's
elementary
that
under
our
bankruptcy
system,
losses
are
suffered
by
creditors
recognized
by
congress
as
having
just
claims.
we
do
not
appropriate
public
funds
in
order
to
pay
all
the
just
claims
in
full.
they
can
be
paid
only
to
the
extent
that
there
are
assets
in
the
estate
available
to
cover
them
and
priorities
are
preferred
status
which
can
be
achieved
only
through
subsidization
by
other
creditors
whose
just
claims
will
be
wholly
or
partially
eclipsed
by
payment
of
the
priority
claim
in
full.
it
happens
that
in
this
case,
the
contest
is
between
a
claim
under
the
second
priority
and
the
government's
claim
under
the
fourth
priority.
but
of
course,
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
transcends
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
its
resolution
will
affect
the
distributions
in
all
bankruptcy
cases.
now,
congress
has
been
very
cautious
in
granting
priorities
as
this
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions.
the
court,
in
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas,
pointed
out
that
the
theme
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
equality
of
distribution.
at
the
outset
then,
before
addressing
ourselves
to
the
relevant
statutory
provisions
and
cases,
which
of
course
must
govern
the
case,
it
might
be
observed
that
at
least
in
ordinary
human
affairs,
when
there
is
a
time
of
financial
exigency,
the
tendency
is
not
to
give
primacy
at
all
cost
to
continuing
to
put
money
aside
for
anticipated
future
needs.
it
might
have
been
as
an
original
proposition
seem
somewhat
remarkable
if
congress
were
to
single
out
for
among
all
the
just
claims
on
the
estate
and
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy,
contributions
owing
to
a
pension
fund,
anyone's
pension
fund
as
being
a
claim
of
such
pressing
need
and
of
such
overriding
importance
as
to
require
subsidization
at
the
expense
of
the
other
just
claims
on
the
estate.
well,
but
of
course,
the
case
must
be
governed
and
controlled
by
what
congress
has
done
in
the
statute
and
the
interpretations
that
have
been
rendered,
but
keeping
in
mind
again
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
nathanson
case,
that
if
one
claimant
is
to
be
preferred
over
others,
the
purpose
should
be
clear
from
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
insurance
benefits
were
credited
to
the
account
of
the
individual
workers.
i
really
don't
think
that
the
rationale
of
the
embassy
case
would
rest
on
so
insignificant
a
distinction
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
priorities
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
i
think
that
the
phrase
“wages
due
to
workman”
as
used
in
section
64a
and
the
second
priority
was
very
carefully
interpreted
by
the
court
in
embassy,
not
in
a
mechanical,
technical
way,
but
in
an
interpretation
based
on
the
review
of
the
entire
history
of
that
provision
and
an
assessment
of
the
statutory
purpose
in
granting
that
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
fortas,
most
of
the
same
things
can
be
said
about
the
present
contributions,
but
i
think
that
the
essential
part
of
the
rationale
in
embassy,
after
an
examination
of
these
individual
attributes
of
the
contribution
and
what
the
court
subsequently
have
used
as
the
guiding
post
in
such
cases
as
sulmeyer
as
to
be
found
on
the
next
page
in
the
opinion
on
page
33
in
the
last
paragraph
that
begins
on
that
page.
after
the
court
satisfied
itself
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
do
not
require
that
these
contributions
be
held
to
be
within
the
meaning
of
the
priority,
the
court
said,
“thus,
they
cannot
be
treated
as
being
within
the
clear,
unequivocal
language
unless
it
is
clear
that
they
satisfy
the
purpose
for
which
congress
established
the
priority”.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
as
the
court
in
embassy
defined
the
customary
attributes
of
wages
as
sums
immediately
due
to
the
workers,
it
is
equally
true
and
it's
certainly
is
true
of
the
courts
view
of
due
to
workmen
since
the
sums
are
paid
to
the
trustees
and
the
workmen
are
limited
in
the
same
way
they
were
in
embassy
as
to
the
control
that
they
can
exercise
over
the
funds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
embassy's?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
was
entitled
not
to
receive
benefits
under
this
welfare
fund
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
health
and
life
insurance
during
the
period
of
his
employment
if
the
premiums
were
paid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
on
the
basis
of
the
contingency
that
he
should
become
ill
or
die
before
the
insurance
policy
expires.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
leaves
the
industry,
there
are
benefits
payable
to
him
under
this
contract
but
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
depends
on
the
extent
to
which
he
has
built
up
a
claim
within
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
cases
yes.
it
depends
on
how
long
he
has
worked
in
the
industry
that
he
--
but
he
is
entitled
to
various
amounts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
depends
on
how
much
he
put
in
in
part.
he
gets
that
back
but
he
also
get
certain
payments
depending
merely
on
the
length
of
time
he
has
been
in
the
industry.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
period
of
some
months
to
those
particular
payments
exist,
again
varying
with
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
is.
he
is
entitled
to
the
return
of
the
amount
that
he
put
in,
in
the
event
that
he
should
leave
the
industry.
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it's
a
variation
from
the
embassy
in
the
atypical
case
of
the
worker
who
leaves
the
industry.
these
men
are
professionals
in
the
electrical
industry
in
new
york
and
i
don't
think
it's
uncommon
for
them
to
work
for
one
employer
and
then
another.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can,
of
course
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
is
not
that
the
priority
should
be
limited
only
to
those
claimants
who
have
left
the
industry
and
will
receive
immediate
benefits.
their
contention
is
that
the
priority
should
be
granted
to
all
arrearages
owing
to
the
fund
regardless
of
whether
there
is
any
immediate
benefit
to
be
secured,
which
is
--
of
course,
in
some
atypical
instances,
there
will
be
a
benefit
secured.
yet
i
think
it's
arguable
that
in
the
embassy
case
itself,
having
health
and
life
insurance
is
a
much
more
immediate
benefit
for
everyone
than
having
additional
contributions
made
to
a
pension
fund.
for
most
of
the
beneficiaries,
there
won't
be
any
benefits
received
until
the
remote
future.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
true
in
both
cases
that
there
is
collective
bargaining
as
to
this
union
welfare
and
pension
funds,
yes
sir.
i
do
believe
that
under
the
rationale
of
embassy,
the
facts
of
embassy
really
represented
a
closer
case
as
to
whether
there
was
a
present
benefit
to
the
workers
than
to
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
it's
quite
conceivable
that
in
a
time
of
displacement,
a
financial
distress
worker
needs
his
health
and
life
insurance
as
much
as
he
needs
funds
for
his
immediate
subsistence
where
he's
not
apt
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
putting
away
moneys
for
the
time
of
his
retirement
during
this
period
of
displacement
so
that
in
one
sense,
embassy
represented
more
immediate
benefits
to
the
worker
than
is
true
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
terms
of
his
having
the
insurance.
the
insurance
itself
is
an
immediate
benefit
even
though
he
may
not
meet
the
contingency
that
would
allow
him
the
payment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
protection
now
of
the
insurance
whereas
he
does
not
loss
the
protection
of
the
moneys
in
his
pension
fund
during
the
period
in
which
the
contributions
are
not
made
to
the
pension
fund.
it's
not
insurance
in
that
sense.
he
still
don't
have
his
annuities
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
i
think
under
the
rationale
of
embassy,
embassy
was
really
a
closer
case
with
typical
workman
covered
than
this
case
is.
the
rationale
really
is
based
in
that
case
on
a
look
at
the
history
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
which
that
priority
must
be
deemed
to
have
served.
and
in
interpreting
the
provision,
the
court
very
carefully
noted
that
from
its
inception
in
1841
and
throughout
its
history,
the
wage
priority
has
always
been
limited
in
three
ways.
it
has
been
limited
in
the
dollar
amount
that
will
be
awarded
to
each
claimant.
it
has
been
limited
in
the
period
of
coverage.
presently,
the
dollar
amount
is
$600
maximum.
the
period
of
coverage
must
be
earned
within
three
months
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy
in
order
to
come
within
the
wage
priority;
and
thirdly,
it
has
been
limited
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
employee's
eligible,
which
is
a
particularly
interesting
limitation
in
terms
of
the
interpretation
to
be
given
to
the
priority,
it
seems
to
me.
for
example,
cases
have
held
the
following
kinds
of
employees
not
to
be
eligible
to
receive
the
priority:
accountants,
actors,
buyers,
designers,
editors,
engineers,
foremen,
teachers
and
others.
it
has
been
a
difficult
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
was
attempting
to
identify
a
particular
category
of
employees
who
would
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
exigencies
of
the
period
of
unpaid
wages
and
should
be
afforded
some
special
protection
in
order
to
equalize
their
status
with
the
status
of
other
creditors
of
the
state
such
as
the
kinds
of
employees
i
just
mentioned
or
any
other
creditors
who
have
afforded
to
the
petitioner
in
bankruptcy
their
services
or
their
label
or
their
property.
and
the
purpose
then
of
awarding
the
priority
was
the
limited
one
of
equalizing
the
status
of
the
workman
who
were
thought
to
be
in
a
more
financially
vulnerable
position
but
not
putting
them
in
a
more
favorable
position
than
the
other
creditors.
and
that
is
why
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
they
do
stem
for
the
legislative
history
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
refers
to
certain
kinds
of
workers.
the
present
language
of
the
statute
at
page
2
--
well,
in
our
brief,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
complete
language
in
our
brief,
but
the
references
to
workmen
whether
paid
by
commission
or
otherwise,
to
salesmen
and
the
like
kind
of
workers.
there
has
been
amendments
in
the
kinds
of
workers
who
will
receive
the
benefit
of
the
priority
over
the
years.
but
nonetheless,
the
priority
has
not
been
extended
to
cover
the
wages
of
all
employees.
many
kinds
of
employees
are
still
merely
general
creditors
who
have
to
stand
behind
these
priorities.
within
this
context
that
this
court
in
embassy
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
was
to
provide
the
workmen
a
protective
cushion
against
the
economic
displacement
caused
by
his
employer's
bankruptcy
and
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
claim
exceeds
$600
or
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
claimant
was
able
to
continue
on
the
job
for
more
than
three
months
without
being
paid,
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
grant
him
priority
as
against
other
claimants.
the
purpose
would
be
fulfilled
if
his
priority
were
recognized
only
within
those
limitations;
limitations
which
originally
were
only
$25
maximum
incidentally
and
it
slowly
been
increased
over
the
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
one
of
the
great
difficulties
with
the
present
structure
of
the
act
being
stretched
to
try
to
accommodate
this
kind
of
claim
within
the
meaning
of
wage
priority.
there
is
no
statutory
basis
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
purpose
of
the
second
priority
could
actually
be
underlined
in
some
cases
in
that
way
by
having
some
of
the
funds
siphoned
off
from
the
worker
and
not
available
to
him
to
meet
his
immediate
needs.
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
in
which
his
own
claims
plus
the
claims
of
the
fund
that
his
account
would
exceed
$600
and
it
would
also
be
true
as
noted
by
this
court
in
embassy
in
the
case
in
which
there
were
not
assets
enough
left
in
the
estate
to
pay
off
the
claims
in
the
second
priority
in
full.
and,
this
court
and
other
courts
would
really
have
to
overturn
a
settled
line
of
cases
in
attempting
distinguish
between
classes
of
claimants
as
to
which
the
statute
draws
no
distinction.
while
the
court
has
been
recognized
just
having
equity
power
to
rearrange
priorities
in
response
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
for
example
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh,
it
would
have
to
have
an
application
because
that's
the
limit
of
the
second
priority
to
the
extent
that
the
claimant's
claim
exceeds
$600,
it
is
relegated
to
the
general
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
if
a
claim
within
a
certain
priority
cannot
be
fully
satisfied
then
they
share
proportionally
and
for
example
if
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
aggregate
amount,
but
the
$500
would
presumably
be
diminished.
he
would
receive
only
5/7th's.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
the
$600
--
5/7th's
of
the
$600
would
go
to
the
workman
and
2/7th's
would
go
to
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
distinction
because
the
purpose
of
granting
the
priority
was
to
be
sure
that
the
workman
would
have
funds
to
get
him
through
the
period
of
economic
displacement.
and
if
those
funds
will
be
siphoned
off
into
the
pension
fund,
their
purpose
will
be
to
that
extent
undermined.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
what
i
meant
to
convey
by
it.
i
meant
the
word
to
be
helpful
in
understanding
this
problem.
there's
another
problem
in
the
present
structure
of
the
act
with
recognition
of
these
claims
and
that
is
the
fact
that
section
17
of
the
act
makes
wage
claims
a
non-dischargeable
debt.
i've
asked
the
clerk
for
the
convenience
the
court
to
distribute
the
text
of
section
17
to
each
of
you
because
it
wasn't
included
in
the
briefs
and
i've
underlined
the
applicable
provision
there.
you
notice
that
it
is
virtually
identical
with
the
provision
in
the
priority
section
with
the
exception
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
section
17
to
$600.
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case
itself
that
the
meaning
of
wages
due
to
workmen
in
the
two
sections
is
intended
to
be
the
same
and
that
is
corroborated
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
17,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
in
note
23
on
page
20.
yet,
the
court
has
said
that
“in
view
of
the
well-known
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
law,
exceptions
to
the
operation
of
its
discharge
thereunder
should
be
confined
to
those
plainly
expressed.
there's
a
--
the
tendency
has
been,
not
only
in
the
courts
but
in
the
congress
itself
to
construe
the
discharge
provision
very
narrowly.
and
when
congress
amended
section
17
in
1966
so
as
to
decrease
the
extent
to
which
tax
claims
are
not
discharged,
the
house
report
noted
that
nondischargeability
“operates
in
a
manner
which
is
unfairly
discriminatory
against
the
private
individual
or
the
unincorporated
small
businessmen.
because
in
most
cases,
when
a
corporation
is
the
petitioner
in
bankruptcy,
that
the
nondischargeability
of
the
debt
is
without
significance
because
the
corporation
is
liquidated
after
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
but
these
debts
remained
with
individuals
and
partnerships
and
small
businessmen.
now,
if
congress
were
to
change
the
rule
of
the
embassy
case,
it
might
well
decide
not
to
make
fund
contributions
a
nondischargeable
debt
even
if
it
wished
to
grant
them
priority
and
it's
certainly
might
further
decide
that
their
priority
should
be
subordinate
to
the
present
wage
claim
priority.
indeed,
the
bills
that
have
been
introduced
expressly
provided
that
the
priority
to
be
granted
by
an
extension
of
the
wage
claim
would
be
subordinate
to
the
present
wage
claim
and
that
if
there
were
not
assets
enough
to
pay
both
the
worker
and
the
fund,
the
worker
would
be
paid
first.
these
are
reasons
why
it
might
seem
more
advisable
for
congress
to
consider
how
to
accommodate
the
structure
of
the
act
to
granting
of
the
claim
priority
that
the
petitioner
has
asked
in
this
court
to
grant
if
indeed
congress
thinks
that
such
a
priority
should
be
granted
at
all.
in
the
nine
years
since
the
decision
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case,
congress
has
been
most
unresponsive
to
bills
that
have
been
introduced
in
every
session
to
repeal
that
case
by
statutory
amendment.
and
this
is
true
even
though
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
been
unresponsive
and
not
enacting
them
even
though
as
you
yourself,
sir,
noted
in
your
dissent
in
embassy
restaurant,
congress
has
on
other
occasions,
been
quick
to
amend
the
section
64
in
response
to
judicial
decisions
that
it
has
disagreed
with
and
we've
cited
those
in
our
brief
on
pages
11
and
12.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
it
seems
it's
especially
questionable
to
attribute
the
failure
of
congress
to
take
action
to
congressional
neglect
of
the
subject
due
to
oppressive
other
affairs
because
the
fact
is
the
congress
has
in
1966
amended
section
64
in
other
respects.
and
in
1967,
it
completely
reenacted
the
section
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
at
page
11.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
there
were,
sir.
we
have
cited
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
purpose
of
the
bills,
as
they
were
drafted,
they're
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
and
12,
was
to
make
pension
fund
contributions
a
claim
that
would
have
priority
under
the
bankruptcy
laws.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
welfare
funds,
that
is
correct.
so
that
it
would
embrace
embassy
and
the
present
case
as
well
if
this
bill
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
directed
toward
embassy
and
toward
the
subject
in
general.
the
response
was
narrow
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
embassy
case,
that
is
true.
but
there's
every
indication
that
funds,
such
as
the
petitioner
have
continued
to
prosper
under
the
rule
of
the
embassy
case
and
the
voices
of
these
funds
and
of
the
unions
with
which
they
are
affiliated
are
not
denied
in
attempt
of
hearing
in
the
halls
of
the
legislature
or
in
the
political
process
in
this
country.
and
in
fact,
it
is
rather
difficult
to
imagine
any
interest
group
of
comparable
political
influence
that
would
be
motivated
to
oppose
these
amendments
that
have
been
submitted
year
after
year.
nevertheless,
congress
has
never
been
persuaded
to
amend
the
law
in
granting
additional
priority.
and
now
this
court
is
being
asked
to
adopt
the
amendment
instead.
it
seems
clear
to
me
what
the
response
of
this
court
should
be
to
such
a
request.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
not
to
loss
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
petitioner
has
a
just
claim
provable
in
bankruptcy,
but
the
issue
is
whether
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
the
petitioner's
claim
priority
over
other
just
claims
that
are
provable
in
bankruptcy.
now
it's
elementary
that
under
our
bankruptcy
system,
losses
are
suffered
by
creditors
recognized
by
congress
as
having
just
claims.
we
do
not
appropriate
public
funds
in
order
to
pay
all
the
just
claims
in
full.
they
can
be
paid
only
to
the
extent
that
there
are
assets
in
the
estate
available
to
cover
them
and
priorities
are
preferred
status
which
can
be
achieved
only
through
subsidization
by
other
creditors
whose
just
claims
will
be
wholly
or
partially
eclipsed
by
payment
of
the
priority
claim
in
full.
it
happens
that
in
this
case,
the
contest
is
between
a
claim
under
the
second
priority
and
the
government's
claim
under
the
fourth
priority.
but
of
course,
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
transcends
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
its
resolution
will
affect
the
distributions
in
all
bankruptcy
cases.
now,
congress
has
been
very
cautious
in
granting
priorities
as
this
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions.
the
court,
in
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas,
pointed
out
that
the
theme
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
equality
of
distribution.
at
the
outset
then,
before
addressing
ourselves
to
the
relevant
statutory
provisions
and
cases,
which
of
course
must
govern
the
case,
it
might
be
observed
that
at
least
in
ordinary
human
affairs,
when
there
is
a
time
of
financial
exigency,
the
tendency
is
not
to
give
primacy
at
all
cost
to
continuing
to
put
money
aside
for
anticipated
future
needs.
it
might
have
been
as
an
original
proposition
seem
somewhat
remarkable
if
congress
were
to
single
out
for
among
all
the
just
claims
on
the
estate
and
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy,
contributions
owing
to
a
pension
fund,
anyone's
pension
fund
as
being
a
claim
of
such
pressing
need
and
of
such
overriding
importance
as
to
require
subsidization
at
the
expense
of
the
other
just
claims
on
the
estate.
well,
but
of
course,
the
case
must
be
governed
and
controlled
by
what
congress
has
done
in
the
statute
and
the
interpretations
that
have
been
rendered,
but
keeping
in
mind
again
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
nathanson
case,
that
if
one
claimant
is
to
be
preferred
over
others,
the
purpose
should
be
clear
from
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
insurance
benefits
were
credited
to
the
account
of
the
individual
workers.
i
really
don't
think
that
the
rationale
of
the
embassy
case
would
rest
on
so
insignificant
a
distinction
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
priorities
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
i
think
that
the
phrase
“wages
due
to
workman”
as
used
in
section
64a
and
the
second
priority
was
very
carefully
interpreted
by
the
court
in
embassy,
not
in
a
mechanical,
technical
way,
but
in
an
interpretation
based
on
the
review
of
the
entire
history
of
that
provision
and
an
assessment
of
the
statutory
purpose
in
granting
that
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
fortas,
most
of
the
same
things
can
be
said
about
the
present
contributions,
but
i
think
that
the
essential
part
of
the
rationale
in
embassy,
after
an
examination
of
these
individual
attributes
of
the
contribution
and
what
the
court
subsequently
have
used
as
the
guiding
post
in
such
cases
as
sulmeyer
as
to
be
found
on
the
next
page
in
the
opinion
on
page
33
in
the
last
paragraph
that
begins
on
that
page.
after
the
court
satisfied
itself
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
do
not
require
that
these
contributions
be
held
to
be
within
the
meaning
of
the
priority,
the
court
said,
“thus,
they
cannot
be
treated
as
being
within
the
clear,
unequivocal
language
unless
it
is
clear
that
they
satisfy
the
purpose
for
which
congress
established
the
priority”.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
as
the
court
in
embassy
defined
the
customary
attributes
of
wages
as
sums
immediately
due
to
the
workers,
it
is
equally
true
and
it's
certainly
is
true
of
the
courts
view
of
due
to
workmen
since
the
sums
are
paid
to
the
trustees
and
the
workmen
are
limited
in
the
same
way
they
were
in
embassy
as
to
the
control
that
they
can
exercise
over
the
funds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
embassy's?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
was
entitled
not
to
receive
benefits
under
this
welfare
fund
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
health
and
life
insurance
during
the
period
of
his
employment
if
the
premiums
were
paid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
on
the
basis
of
the
contingency
that
he
should
become
ill
or
die
before
the
insurance
policy
expires.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
leaves
the
industry,
there
are
benefits
payable
to
him
under
this
contract
but
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
depends
on
the
extent
to
which
he
has
built
up
a
claim
within
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
some
cases
yes.
it
depends
on
how
long
he
has
worked
in
the
industry
that
he
--
but
he
is
entitled
to
various
amounts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
depends
on
how
much
he
put
in
in
part.
he
gets
that
back
but
he
also
get
certain
payments
depending
merely
on
the
length
of
time
he
has
been
in
the
industry.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
period
of
some
months
to
those
particular
payments
exist,
again
varying
with
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
is.
he
is
entitled
to
the
return
of
the
amount
that
he
put
in,
in
the
event
that
he
should
leave
the
industry.
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it's
a
variation
from
the
embassy
in
the
atypical
case
of
the
worker
who
leaves
the
industry.
these
men
are
professionals
in
the
electrical
industry
in
new
york
and
i
don't
think
it's
uncommon
for
them
to
work
for
one
employer
and
then
another.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can,
of
course
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
is
not
that
the
priority
should
be
limited
only
to
those
claimants
who
have
left
the
industry
and
will
receive
immediate
benefits.
their
contention
is
that
the
priority
should
be
granted
to
all
arrearages
owing
to
the
fund
regardless
of
whether
there
is
any
immediate
benefit
to
be
secured,
which
is
--
of
course,
in
some
atypical
instances,
there
will
be
a
benefit
secured.
yet
i
think
it's
arguable
that
in
the
embassy
case
itself,
having
health
and
life
insurance
is
a
much
more
immediate
benefit
for
everyone
than
having
additional
contributions
made
to
a
pension
fund.
for
most
of
the
beneficiaries,
there
won't
be
any
benefits
received
until
the
remote
future.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
true
in
both
cases
that
there
is
collective
bargaining
as
to
this
union
welfare
and
pension
funds,
yes
sir.
i
do
believe
that
under
the
rationale
of
embassy,
the
facts
of
embassy
really
represented
a
closer
case
as
to
whether
there
was
a
present
benefit
to
the
workers
than
to
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
it's
quite
conceivable
that
in
a
time
of
displacement,
a
financial
distress
worker
needs
his
health
and
life
insurance
as
much
as
he
needs
funds
for
his
immediate
subsistence
where
he's
not
apt
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
putting
away
moneys
for
the
time
of
his
retirement
during
this
period
of
displacement
so
that
in
one
sense,
embassy
represented
more
immediate
benefits
to
the
worker
than
is
true
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
terms
of
his
having
the
insurance.
the
insurance
itself
is
an
immediate
benefit
even
though
he
may
not
meet
the
contingency
that
would
allow
him
the
payment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
protection
now
of
the
insurance
whereas
he
does
not
loss
the
protection
of
the
moneys
in
his
pension
fund
during
the
period
in
which
the
contributions
are
not
made
to
the
pension
fund.
it's
not
insurance
in
that
sense.
he
still
don't
have
his
annuities
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
i
think
under
the
rationale
of
embassy,
embassy
was
really
a
closer
case
with
typical
workman
covered
than
this
case
is.
the
rationale
really
is
based
in
that
case
on
a
look
at
the
history
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
which
that
priority
must
be
deemed
to
have
served.
and
in
interpreting
the
provision,
the
court
very
carefully
noted
that
from
its
inception
in
1841
and
throughout
its
history,
the
wage
priority
has
always
been
limited
in
three
ways.
it
has
been
limited
in
the
dollar
amount
that
will
be
awarded
to
each
claimant.
it
has
been
limited
in
the
period
of
coverage.
presently,
the
dollar
amount
is
$600
maximum.
the
period
of
coverage
must
be
earned
within
three
months
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy
in
order
to
come
within
the
wage
priority;
and
thirdly,
it
has
been
limited
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
employee's
eligible,
which
is
a
particularly
interesting
limitation
in
terms
of
the
interpretation
to
be
given
to
the
priority,
it
seems
to
me.
for
example,
cases
have
held
the
following
kinds
of
employees
not
to
be
eligible
to
receive
the
priority:
accountants,
actors,
buyers,
designers,
editors,
engineers,
foremen,
teachers
and
others.
it
has
been
a
difficult
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
was
attempting
to
identify
a
particular
category
of
employees
who
would
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
exigencies
of
the
period
of
unpaid
wages
and
should
be
afforded
some
special
protection
in
order
to
equalize
their
status
with
the
status
of
other
creditors
of
the
state
such
as
the
kinds
of
employees
i
just
mentioned
or
any
other
creditors
who
have
afforded
to
the
petitioner
in
bankruptcy
their
services
or
their
label
or
their
property.
and
the
purpose
then
of
awarding
the
priority
was
the
limited
one
of
equalizing
the
status
of
the
workman
who
were
thought
to
be
in
a
more
financially
vulnerable
position
but
not
putting
them
in
a
more
favorable
position
than
the
other
creditors.
and
that
is
why
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
they
do
stem
for
the
legislative
history
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
refers
to
certain
kinds
of
workers.
the
present
language
of
the
statute
at
page
2
--
well,
in
our
brief,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
complete
language
in
our
brief,
but
the
references
to
workmen
whether
paid
by
commission
or
otherwise,
to
salesmen
and
the
like
kind
of
workers.
there
has
been
amendments
in
the
kinds
of
workers
who
will
receive
the
benefit
of
the
priority
over
the
years.
but
nonetheless,
the
priority
has
not
been
extended
to
cover
the
wages
of
all
employees.
many
kinds
of
employees
are
still
merely
general
creditors
who
have
to
stand
behind
these
priorities.
within
this
context
that
this
court
in
embassy
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
was
to
provide
the
workmen
a
protective
cushion
against
the
economic
displacement
caused
by
his
employer's
bankruptcy
and
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
claim
exceeds
$600
or
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
claimant
was
able
to
continue
on
the
job
for
more
than
three
months
without
being
paid,
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
grant
him
priority
as
against
other
claimants.
the
purpose
would
be
fulfilled
if
his
priority
were
recognized
only
within
those
limitations;
limitations
which
originally
were
only
$25
maximum
incidentally
and
it
slowly
been
increased
over
the
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
one
of
the
great
difficulties
with
the
present
structure
of
the
act
being
stretched
to
try
to
accommodate
this
kind
of
claim
within
the
meaning
of
wage
priority.
there
is
no
statutory
basis
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
purpose
of
the
second
priority
could
actually
be
underlined
in
some
cases
in
that
way
by
having
some
of
the
funds
siphoned
off
from
the
worker
and
not
available
to
him
to
meet
his
immediate
needs.
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
in
which
his
own
claims
plus
the
claims
of
the
fund
that
his
account
would
exceed
$600
and
it
would
also
be
true
as
noted
by
this
court
in
embassy
in
the
case
in
which
there
were
not
assets
enough
left
in
the
estate
to
pay
off
the
claims
in
the
second
priority
in
full.
and,
this
court
and
other
courts
would
really
have
to
overturn
a
settled
line
of
cases
in
attempting
distinguish
between
classes
of
claimants
as
to
which
the
statute
draws
no
distinction.
while
the
court
has
been
recognized
just
having
equity
power
to
rearrange
priorities
in
response
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
for
example
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh,
it
would
have
to
have
an
application
because
that's
the
limit
of
the
second
priority
to
the
extent
that
the
claimant's
claim
exceeds
$600,
it
is
relegated
to
the
general
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
if
a
claim
within
a
certain
priority
cannot
be
fully
satisfied
then
they
share
proportionally
and
for
example
if
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
aggregate
amount,
but
the
$500
would
presumably
be
diminished.
he
would
receive
only
5/7th's.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
the
$600
--
5/7th's
of
the
$600
would
go
to
the
workman
and
2/7th's
would
go
to
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
distinction
because
the
purpose
of
granting
the
priority
was
to
be
sure
that
the
workman
would
have
funds
to
get
him
through
the
period
of
economic
displacement.
and
if
those
funds
will
be
siphoned
off
into
the
pension
fund,
their
purpose
will
be
to
that
extent
undermined.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
what
i
meant
to
convey
by
it.
i
meant
the
word
to
be
helpful
in
understanding
this
problem.
there's
another
problem
in
the
present
structure
of
the
act
with
recognition
of
these
claims
and
that
is
the
fact
that
section
17
of
the
act
makes
wage
claims
a
non-dischargeable
debt.
i've
asked
the
clerk
for
the
convenience
the
court
to
distribute
the
text
of
section
17
to
each
of
you
because
it
wasn't
included
in
the
briefs
and
i've
underlined
the
applicable
provision
there.
you
notice
that
it
is
virtually
identical
with
the
provision
in
the
priority
section
with
the
exception
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
section
17
to
$600.
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case
itself
that
the
meaning
of
wages
due
to
workmen
in
the
two
sections
is
intended
to
be
the
same
and
that
is
corroborated
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
17,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
in
note
23
on
page
20.
yet,
the
court
has
said
that
“in
view
of
the
well-known
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
law,
exceptions
to
the
operation
of
its
discharge
thereunder
should
be
confined
to
those
plainly
expressed.
there's
a
--
the
tendency
has
been,
not
only
in
the
courts
but
in
the
congress
itself
to
construe
the
discharge
provision
very
narrowly.
and
when
congress
amended
section
17
in
1966
so
as
to
decrease
the
extent
to
which
tax
claims
are
not
discharged,
the
house
report
noted
that
nondischargeability
“operates
in
a
manner
which
is
unfairly
discriminatory
against
the
private
individual
or
the
unincorporated
small
businessmen.
because
in
most
cases,
when
a
corporation
is
the
petitioner
in
bankruptcy,
that
the
nondischargeability
of
the
debt
is
without
significance
because
the
corporation
is
liquidated
after
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
but
these
debts
remained
with
individuals
and
partnerships
and
small
businessmen.
now,
if
congress
were
to
change
the
rule
of
the
embassy
case,
it
might
well
decide
not
to
make
fund
contributions
a
nondischargeable
debt
even
if
it
wished
to
grant
them
priority
and
it's
certainly
might
further
decide
that
their
priority
should
be
subordinate
to
the
present
wage
claim
priority.
indeed,
the
bills
that
have
been
introduced
expressly
provided
that
the
priority
to
be
granted
by
an
extension
of
the
wage
claim
would
be
subordinate
to
the
present
wage
claim
and
that
if
there
were
not
assets
enough
to
pay
both
the
worker
and
the
fund,
the
worker
would
be
paid
first.
these
are
reasons
why
it
might
seem
more
advisable
for
congress
to
consider
how
to
accommodate
the
structure
of
the
act
to
granting
of
the
claim
priority
that
the
petitioner
has
asked
in
this
court
to
grant
if
indeed
congress
thinks
that
such
a
priority
should
be
granted
at
all.
in
the
nine
years
since
the
decision
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case,
congress
has
been
most
unresponsive
to
bills
that
have
been
introduced
in
every
session
to
repeal
that
case
by
statutory
amendment.
and
this
is
true
even
though
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
been
unresponsive
and
not
enacting
them
even
though
as
you
yourself,
sir,
noted
in
your
dissent
in
embassy
restaurant,
congress
has
on
other
occasions,
been
quick
to
amend
the
section
64
in
response
to
judicial
decisions
that
it
has
disagreed
with
and
we've
cited
those
in
our
brief
on
pages
11
and
12.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
it
seems
it's
especially
questionable
to
attribute
the
failure
of
congress
to
take
action
to
congressional
neglect
of
the
subject
due
to
oppressive
other
affairs
because
the
fact
is
the
congress
has
in
1966
amended
section
64
in
other
respects.
and
in
1967,
it
completely
reenacted
the
section
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
at
page
11.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
there
were,
sir.
we
have
cited
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
purpose
of
the
bills,
as
they
were
drafted,
they're
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
and
12,
was
to
make
pension
fund
contributions
a
claim
that
would
have
priority
under
the
bankruptcy
laws.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
welfare
funds,
that
is
correct.
so
that
it
would
embrace
embassy
and
the
present
case
as
well
if
this
bill
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
directed
toward
embassy
and
toward
the
subject
in
general.
the
response
was
narrow
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
embassy
case,
that
is
true.
but
there's
every
indication
that
funds,
such
as
the
petitioner
have
continued
to
prosper
under
the
rule
of
the
embassy
case
and
the
voices
of
these
funds
and
of
the
unions
with
which
they
are
affiliated
are
not
denied
in
attempt
of
hearing
in
the
halls
of
the
legislature
or
in
the
political
process
in
this
country.
and
in
fact,
it
is
rather
difficult
to
imagine
any
interest
group
of
comparable
political
influence
that
would
be
motivated
to
oppose
these
amendments
that
have
been
submitted
year
after
year.
nevertheless,
congress
has
never
been
persuaded
to
amend
the
law
in
granting
additional
priority.
and
now
this
court
is
being
asked
to
adopt
the
amendment
instead.
it
seems
clear
to
me
what
the
response
of
this
court
should
be
to
such
a
request.
