justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
a
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
hew
approval
of
your
plan
still
outstanding?
hew
did
approve
the
plan
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
hew
approval
expressed
in
the
form
of
letter
or
something
of
the
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
do
these
two
school
complexes
have
interschool
athletics?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
and
but
they
do
--
they
do
have
athletic
teams
to
play
other
schools,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well
here,
the
result
of
the
free
choice
--
so-called
free
choice
is
to
place
any
negro
in
a
white
school,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that's
in
the
raney
cases,
i
understand
that
there's
about
20%
of
the
negroes
who
are
in
the
white
school,
is
that
right?
is
that
your
instinct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
they
become
--
i
gather
that
the
system
did
accomplish
that
much.
it
did
accomplish
the
placement
of
any
negroes
in
the
white
school,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it
left
the
negro
school
all
negroes
as
i
understand
it.
i
suppose
that
the
resulting
situation
of
whatever
plan
it
was
the
school
board
adopted
was
to
have
20%
negroes
in
the
white
school
and
20%
whites
in
the
negro
school,
would
that
still
offend
your
conception
of
the
result
about
to
be
achieved
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
wonder
if
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
are
we
or
are
we
not,
we're
not
playing
games
it's
deadly
serious
but
there
is
a
test
of
the
result
here.
a
statistical
test
if
it's
not,
what
is
it?
is
it
a
test
of
good
faith
or
just
what
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
asking
mr.
claiborne,
how
do
you
test
the
adequacy
of
the
result?
now,
here
you
did
have
--
a
result
of
this
system
was
that
any
negroes
landed
in
the
white
school,
there
had
been
none
before
as
i
understand
it.
that's
in
the
raney
case.
and
let
--
well,
let's
just
take
that
alone.
what
does
that
say
to
you
with
respect
to
the
result
so
far
as
the
previous
in
white
schools
that
was
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
me
in
raney
or
you
could
take
one
of
these
other
cases
that's
easier
for
you,
what
--
the
alternative
method
might
be
that
seems
feasible
and
which
would
produce
a
different
result.
justice
abe
fortas
in
which
one?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
this
--
if
i
understand
it
is
for
the
standard
of
compliance
with
brown
in
a
previously
segregation
school
district,
should
be
whether
of
the
alternatives
reasonably
available,
that
alternative
was
adopted
which
would
result
of
the
maximum
desegregation.
justice
abe
fortas
