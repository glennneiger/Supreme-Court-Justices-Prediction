mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
two
cases
preceding
it
involves
an
issue
of
remedy,
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
a
school
district
must
do
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
brown
v.
board
of
education
are
not
merely
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
brown
as
to
having
maintained
generations
of
segregation
but
after
having
maintained
segregation
for
a
decade,
following
this
court's
decision
in
brown.
the
gould
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
was
--
it
is
perhaps
difficult
to
disentangle
the
procedure
that
is
required
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
--
i
might
put
it
that
way,
yeah.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
might
put
it
that
way.
the
gould
special
school
district
is
a
small
district
of
approximately
3,000
population.
in
the
1965-66
school
year,
when
this
litigation
began,
the
total
school
enrolment
was
879.
as
of
december
1965,
the
district
had
taken
no
steps
whatsoever
to
comply
with
this
court's
decision,
brown
against
board
of
education.
it
maintained
at
that
time
and
indeed
continues
to
maintain
at
this
time
two
complexes
of
buildings
about
10
blocks
from
each
other,
each
one
having
an
elementary
and
a
secondary
school.
the
gould
school,
named
after
the
community,
is
the
white
school
complex;
the
field
school
is
all
negro.
after
passage
of
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
gould
instituted
freedom
of
choice.
it
covered
all
12
grades
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
a
hundred
students
applied.
there
was
not
adequate
--
a
hundred
negro
students
applied
to
go
to
the
white
school;
no
white
students
applied
to
go
to
the
negro
school.
there
was
not
adequate
room
for
all
the
negro
students
who
applied
to
go
to
the
white
school,
and
28
were
sent
back.
i
might
note
that
since
then,
freedom
of
choice
has
continued
to
operate
and
never
again
has
the
level
attained
anywhere
close
to
a
hundred.
it
is
covered
around
70
and
this
school
year's
gone
up
to
80.
but
when
it
started,
there
was
sufficient
eagerness
for
a
hundred
to
apply,
which
we
haven't
reached
again.
and
these
were
children
the
5th,
10th,
and
11th
grades
and
they
were
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
field
complex
says
the
negro
school
complex
has
approximately
500
students.
the
--
the
gould
school
complex
has
approximately
370
students,
70
of
whom
were
non-negro
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
plus
80
negro
this
year,
80
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
fact,
those
facts
are
in
our
brief
and
not
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
white
children
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
the
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
negro
schools
are
very
decidedly
inferior
and
unaccredited,
and
the
white
schools
are
accredited
as
a.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
also
the
difference
in
teachers'
salary,
which
is
explained
as
they
put
it
on
the
base
of
supply
and
demand.
they
felt
they
could
give
the
negro
teachers
cheaper
and
they
didn't
see
any
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
now,
the
--
the
first
year
the
freedom
of
choice
actually
went
into
operation,
there
were
70
negroes
who
transferred
to
gould
and
the
second
year,
there
were
71
and
this
year,
there
are
approximately
80.
in
the
previous
cases,
there
was
considerable
questioning
from
the
bench
concerning
what
was
the
motivation
behind
the
institution
with
the
freedom
of
choice
plan.
but
in
this
case,
it's
not
necessary
to
guess
that.
it
set
forth
rather
explicitly
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
18,
i
may
read
a
sentence
or
two,
“since
there
are
about”
--
last
paragraph
on
page
18
--
“since
there
are
about
two
negro
students
for
each
white
student
in
this
school
district,
the
procedure
suggested
by
petitioners
as
a
feasible
alternative
to
freedom
of
choice
would
result
in
both
schools
being
predominantly
negro
if
the
white
students
continue
to
attend
them.
however,
most,
if
not
all,
would
be
withdrawn,
although
desegregation
is
an
accomplished
fact
in
this
district
and
every
white
child
is
attending
school
where
negro
students
exceed
20%
of
the
student
body,
the
white
parents
in
gould
would
be
no
more
willing
than
those
in
chicago,
washington
or
new
york
to
send
their
children
to
predominantly
negro
schools,”
so
that's
why
the
plan
was
adopted
here.
there's
--
this
is
offered
as
a
justification
on
basis
of
the
respondent's
case.
during
the
case,
a
school
construction
program
began
and
a
motion
was
made
at
trial
that
the
new
construction,
which
was
going
to
be
a
replacement
for
the
negro
high
school
building
that
was
built
in
1924,
be
put
on
the
white
campus
or
the
white
school
complex.
that
was
denied.
then,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
a
motion
was
made
that
since
the
school
already
had
been
completed
that
there
be
some
reallocation
of
the
function
of
facilities,
that
is
that
the
gould
complex
be
used
as
a
high
school
facility
completely
for
all
the
high
school
students
and
that
the
field
school
complex
be
used
as
an
elementary
school
complex.
it
turned
out
the
numbers
are
just
about
right.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
that
might
be
done
but
as
it
said,
this
was
not
the
time.
and
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
approved
what
was
done
by
the
respondent's
school
district
citing
with
approval
and
--
and
as
partial
justification
that
the
plan
and
its
operation
had
been
approved
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
which
a
procedure
has
been
adopted
by
respondent
after
more
than
ten
years
of
violating
the
requirements
of
brown
which
has
the
purpose
that's
stated
in
the
brief
and
has
had
the
result
of
continuing
the
existence
of
an
all
negro
school
complex
and
the
admission
of
small
and
stable
proportion
of
negro
children
to
a
formerly
all
white
school.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
my
position
would
be
the
same
but
it's
entirely
possible
that
condition
might
not
have
persisted
because
i
think
if
it
--
it
may
be.
i
--
this
has
never
happened
as
far
as
--
it
may
be
that
if
it
were
introduced
today
after
brown.
it
would
have
expressed
their
willingness
and
acceptance
on
the
part
of
the
community
to
do
something
about
this
rather
than
a
decade
of
hostility
and
tipathy
to
the
decision
which
discourages
freedom
of
choice.
but
that
to
me
is
so
hypothetical.
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
any
more
adequately
than
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
read
brown
to
report
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system.
now,
there
has
been
in
some
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
some
debate
over
integration
or
desegregation
or
compulsory
integration.
i
think
that
becomes
after
a
while
a
semantic
morass.
i
think
the
issue
is
what
are
the
available
alternatives?
what
are
the
options
a
school
district
may
exercise
to
end
up
with
a
school
system
which
is
as
far
as
possible
different
in
terms
of
racial
composition
or
racial
allocation
than
the
school
system
they
had
before
1954.
it
may
be
that
some
of
those
options
are
a
lot
feasible
or
not
attainable
in
terms
of
other
educational
considerations
or
expense.
that
may
or
may
not
be.
but
in
this
case,
indeed
in
most
instances,
there
are
available
options
and
we
think
those
options
should
be
--
the
option
which
produces
the
greatest
departure
from
the
preexisting
situation
should
be
used
rather
than
the
option
which
produces
the
least,
especially
where
the
option
was
produces
the
least
was
adopted
with
that
expectation
in
mind.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black,
the
typical
method
of
assigning
students
to
school
before
the
brown
decision
as
this
civil
rights
commission
report
here
shows,
and
the
typical
method
of
assigning
students
to
school
all
over
the
country
generally
has
been
just
to
assign
students
to
school
and
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that
being
assigned
to
a
school,
even
though
one
might
object
to
go
to
that
school
is
denied
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
we
face
the
question
of
disestablishing
a
system
which
has
been
run
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
it's
the
denial
of
anyone's
right
to
set
up
zones
or
allocation
of
school
facilities.
or
indeed
in
some
circumstances
as
our
brief
points
out,
perhaps
even
freedom
of
choice.
as
the
best
of
available
options
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
--
i
would
think
ordinarily
not,
no,
but
as
--
as
the
best
of
existing
ways
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
through
the
preexisting
unconstitutional
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
i
don't
think
since
the
case
is
all
about
race,
i
don't
think
you
can
put
race
out
of
your
head.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
--
i
would
say
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
yes,
though
i
would
assume
that
that
would
not
be
the
inexorable
and
overriding
fact
in
all
circumstances.
i
think
you'll
have
to
look
at
what
the
available
options
are.
in
this
situation
for
example
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
think
so,
yes.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
unscramble
--
i
don't
see
you
can
unscramble
a
racial
desegregated
situation
without
taking
race
about
how
you
doing
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
you
would
only
--
just
to
take
a
simple
hypothetical
case,
to
desegregate
a
school
--
in
desegregating
a
school
system,
you
could
draw
a
north
to
south
line
or
east
to
west
line.
you
will
see
one
would
keep
you
as
segregated
as
before
and
the
other
would
establish
substantial
integration.
given
those
two
options,
you
have
to
make
a
choice
and
i
would
assume
you'd
take
the
one
that
give
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
you
cannot
ignore
the
racial
consideration.
i
--
i
just
don't
--
and
i
don't
think
that
anyone
doing
it
actually
does
ignore
it.
to
me,
it's
inconceivable
with
someone
facing
a
situation
in
which
he's
trying
to
draw
a
school
--
redraw
school
zone
lines
somehow
that
puts
the
consideration
of
race
out
of
his
head.
i've
heard
children
play
a
game
and
would
--
with
--
which
one
tell
another
don't
think
of
an
elephant,
and
that's
of
course
all
they
do
is
think
of
an
elephant.
well,
you
can't
say
integrate
the
school
system
but
don't
think
about
race.
you
have
to
think
about
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
we
say
this
is
in
many
respects
like
anderson
against
martin
when
race
was
put
up
there
in
the
ballot
and
you
can't
go
into
the
ballot
box
and
then
vote
and
keep
that
out
of
your
mind
once
the
state
has
done
it.
but
i
might
say
that
in
this
case,
there's
more
than
that
involved.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
more
than
that
involved
because
we
don't
have
what
i
might
call
antiseptic
free
choice
here.
there's
a
great
deal
more
going
on,
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
not
involuntary,
mr.
justice
black,
in
a
sense
that
there
has
been
any
great
showing
of
intimidation
or
coercion.
there
perhaps
maybe
some
slightly
--
some
slight
showing
of
it,
but
it's
based
upon
what
you
might
extract
from
circumstances
that
one
reasonably
might
expect
to
have
deterring
influence
on
the
negro
children
and
families.
i
mean
for
example,
the
fact
of
maintenance
of
segregation
for
ten
years
after
brown,
i
think,
shows
what
the
attitude
of
the
school
district
is.
i
think
the
sending
of
the
28
children
back
after
they
showed
up
one
day
and
said,
“okay,
we've
got
free
choice.
can
we
come?”
and
then
they
said,
“no,
there's
no
room
for
you”
instead
of
using
some
neutral
--
some
neutral
factor.
the
segregation
of
faculty,
the
faculties
here
are
segregated
and
the
negro
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
wasn't
room
--
there
--
there
wasn't
room
for
them,
but
rather
than
use
some
neutral
standard
whereby
white
and
negro
children
would
be
judged
equally
as
being
qualified
to
fill
the
space
in
the
school,
the
negro
children
were
just
sent
back
because
they
were
the
applicants
coming
from
the
negro
school.
there
could
have
been
some
objective
standard
rather
than
the
fact
that
you
were
the
negro
who
came
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
were
just
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
was
never
considered.
they
just
sent
them
back.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
they
just
sent
them
back.
it
is
in
interesting
to
note
on
page
51
of
the
record,
and
i've
read
this
record
many
times
but
this
just
dawned
upon
me,
the
superintendent
refers
white
schools
our
school
but
the
negro
school
as
a
negro
school.
school
construction
was
undertaken
during
the
course
of
this
case,
which
tended
to
perpetuate
a
dual
school
complex.
the
--
the
--
the
worth
that
the
school
district
places
upon
the
negro
children
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
they
have
gone
to
unaccredited
schools
whereas
the
white
children
have
gone
to
accredited
schools.
now,
it
might
be
argued
that
notwithstanding
all
this,
all
these
circumstances,
freedom
of
choice
was
perhaps
justified
as
the
best
available
of
all
alternatives
to
reach
desegregation
where
it
might
be
argued
the
freedom
of
choice
was
like
more
economical
or
simpler
to
administer.
but
the
record
indicates
quite
the
contrary.
they're
running
two
sets
of
science
rooms.
they're
running
two
auditoriums
and
gymnasiums,
two
sets
of
cafeterias
under
the
new
system.
it
would
be
far
more
economical
to
divide
up
the
--
allocate
the
school
facilities
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
and
--
but
that's
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
obviously,
they
would
have
to
be
adhering
on
something
like
that.
but
certainly,
it
should
not
have
been
put
out
of
mind
and
out
of
hand
as
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jack
greenberg
could
not
send
the
children
to
a
private
school,
genuinely
private
school,
not
a
states-subsidized
private
school?
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
no.
i
would
think
that
introduces
other
considerations.
i
would
think
one
might
have
the
right
--
no
one
has
questioned
the
right
to
send
one's
child
to
a
genuinely
private
school
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
a
whole
series
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
that
that
--
or
anyone
has
ever
suggested
that.
i
think
the
pierce
case
and
those
other
cases
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
no,
it
wouldn't
reach
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
because
i
think
then,
some
other
principles
were
introduced
into
the
case
and
those
other
principles
to
me
suggest
that
again,
out
of
the
pierce
and
the
mayer
case
and
so
forth
that
parents
do
have
the
right
to
select
a
private
education
for
their
children
if
it
meets
certain
standards.
mr.
jack
greenberg
can
the
state
take
away
the
right
to
send
children
to
a
private
school?
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
confess
that
i
have
not
considered
that
to
be
an
issue
here.
i
have
not
adequately
thought
it
through.
i
just
wouldn't
know.
i
think
it
does
--
invoke
a
whole
additional
series
of
considerations
in
a
related
but
different
branch
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
in
conclusion,
the
basis
of
our
position
is
that
when
a
school
district
is
faced
with
the
task
of
remedying
preexisting
segregation,
one
must
look
at
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
options,
what
are
the
alternatives,
and
which
of
them
consistent
with
educational
principles
and
economic
considerations
is
more
likely
to
achieve
the
maximum
integration
or
desegregation
if
you
will.
in
this
case,
i
think
that's
--
the
answer
is
rather
clear
indeed.
i
think
it
is
in
all
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
today.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
i
--
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
--
would
announce
that
there's
a
positive
duty
on
the
part
of
the
school
systems
to
disestablish
preexisting
segregated
systems,
that
it's
not
enough
to
merely
announce
something
which
is
called
freedom
of
choice,
that
where
various
alternatives
are
available
such
as
drawing
of
school
district
lines
or
reallocating
facilities
as
between
elementary
and
secondary
school
use.
those
options
should
be
canvassed
and
the
one
which
is
likely
to
achieve
the
greatest
amount
of
integration
and
assuming
that
it's
all
consistent
with
other
educational
factors
should
--
should
be
employed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
in
such
cases
though.
as
i
said,
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
may
be
there
are
some
communities
where
residential
segregation
is
so
rigid
that
freedom
of
choice
perhaps
might
be
the
only
way
to
--
to
eliminate
the
preexisting
system.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
the
traditional
flexibility
of
a
court
of
equity
here
and
i
think
the
general
principles
are
--
are
not
at
least
as
i've
suggested
and
terribly
difficult.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
that
mr.
gray
is
going
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
your
honor,
he's
going
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
moment
remaining,
i
like
just
to
make
several
points.
i
think
these
cases
come
down
to
several
propositions
among
which
i
think
the
most
prominent
one
is
of
whether
or
not
a
school
system
has
disestablished
segregation
when
it
continues
to
remain
in
existence,
the
all
negro
school
which
is
the
symbol
of
the
segregated
system
in
circumstances
when
steps
can
be
taken
--
quite
reasonable
steps
can
be
taken
to
end
that
situation.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
perhaps
just
for
the
moment
to
the
proposition
that
has
been
mentioned
several
times
today,
the
possibility
that
something
like
free
choice
may
be
a
constitutional
right.
if
that
is
so,
it's
certainly
has
not
been
articulated
previously.
it
certainly
appears
nowhere
explicitly
in
the
constitution.
and
finally,
if
it
were
the
case,
it
would
totally
upset
the
administration
of
school
systems
throughout
the
county
because
most
of
them
traditionally
for
generations
have
operated
upon
a
basis
of
assigning
children.
finally,
i
may
be
permitted
a
personal
reference
that
was
a
quotation
from
race
relations
in
american
law
and
it's
to
that
where
some
reference
to
statements
out
of
context
i
might
say
i
did
not
know
then
what
i
know
now.
and
if
i
had
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
no.
if
--
yes,
if
i
had
known
it,
i
would
have
stated
the
matter
somewhat
differently.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
not
have
written
that
section
of
the
book.
now,
i
think
i
would
have
written
it
but
i
would
have
stated
things
differently.
actually,
i
think
it
is
somewhat
out
of
context
but
i
would
not
have
written
anything
susceptible
to
such
an
interpretation.
finally,
this
entire
question
of
flight
in
connection
with
this
proposition
being
raised
in
the
brief,
we
did
a
bit
of
research
on
just
how
many
majority
school
districts
there
are
in
united
states
or
at
least
in
the
region
of
the
country
that
would
be
affected
by
this
decision.
of
the
approximately
6,000
school
district's
in
the
seventeen
sovereign
and
border
states,
303
approximately
5%
have
negro
student
majorities
and
even
smaller
percentage
have
60%
negro
student
bodies.
so
the
matters,
as
a
practical
matter,
are
not
of
any
great
consequence.
as
a
matter
of
principle,
however,
it
invokes
the
considerations
and
the
statement
of
the
brown
case
that
hostility
may
not
be
grounds
for
refusing
to
abide
by
this
decision,
reiterated
in
cooper
against
aaron
and
ultimately
the
proposition
of
when
this
court
expounds
the
constitution,
it
states
a
proposition
and
the
principle
which
is
a
practical
matter
at
any
given
moment
may
not
be
actually
attainable
but
something
that
we
at
least
want
to
work
towards
and
that
proposition
as
i
see
brown
is
official
being
one
country
rather
than
two
and
that
we
should
not
acquiesce
in
various
schemes
and
devices
to
frustrate
the
principle
of
the
brown
decision
which
i
think
is
perhaps
the
greatest
thing
ever
to
happen
--
to
come
out
of
this
court
in
the
history
of
the
nation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
two
cases
preceding
it
involves
an
issue
of
remedy,
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
a
school
district
must
do
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
brown
v.
board
of
education
are
not
merely
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
brown
as
to
having
maintained
generations
of
segregation
but
after
having
maintained
segregation
for
a
decade,
following
this
court's
decision
in
brown.
the
gould
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
was
--
it
is
perhaps
difficult
to
disentangle
the
procedure
that
is
required
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
--
i
might
put
it
that
way,
yeah.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
might
put
it
that
way.
the
gould
special
school
district
is
a
small
district
of
approximately
3,000
population.
in
the
1965-66
school
year,
when
this
litigation
began,
the
total
school
enrolment
was
879.
as
of
december
1965,
the
district
had
taken
no
steps
whatsoever
to
comply
with
this
court's
decision,
brown
against
board
of
education.
it
maintained
at
that
time
and
indeed
continues
to
maintain
at
this
time
two
complexes
of
buildings
about
10
blocks
from
each
other,
each
one
having
an
elementary
and
a
secondary
school.
the
gould
school,
named
after
the
community,
is
the
white
school
complex;
the
field
school
is
all
negro.
after
passage
of
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
gould
instituted
freedom
of
choice.
it
covered
all
12
grades
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
a
hundred
students
applied.
there
was
not
adequate
--
a
hundred
negro
students
applied
to
go
to
the
white
school;
no
white
students
applied
to
go
to
the
negro
school.
there
was
not
adequate
room
for
all
the
negro
students
who
applied
to
go
to
the
white
school,
and
28
were
sent
back.
i
might
note
that
since
then,
freedom
of
choice
has
continued
to
operate
and
never
again
has
the
level
attained
anywhere
close
to
a
hundred.
it
is
covered
around
70
and
this
school
year's
gone
up
to
80.
but
when
it
started,
there
was
sufficient
eagerness
for
a
hundred
to
apply,
which
we
haven't
reached
again.
and
these
were
children
the
5th,
10th,
and
11th
grades
and
they
were
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
field
complex
says
the
negro
school
complex
has
approximately
500
students.
the
--
the
gould
school
complex
has
approximately
370
students,
70
of
whom
were
non-negro
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
plus
80
negro
this
year,
80
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
fact,
those
facts
are
in
our
brief
and
not
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
white
children
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
the
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
negro
schools
are
very
decidedly
inferior
and
unaccredited,
and
the
white
schools
are
accredited
as
a.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
also
the
difference
in
teachers'
salary,
which
is
explained
as
they
put
it
on
the
base
of
supply
and
demand.
they
felt
they
could
give
the
negro
teachers
cheaper
and
they
didn't
see
any
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
now,
the
--
the
first
year
the
freedom
of
choice
actually
went
into
operation,
there
were
70
negroes
who
transferred
to
gould
and
the
second
year,
there
were
71
and
this
year,
there
are
approximately
80.
in
the
previous
cases,
there
was
considerable
questioning
from
the
bench
concerning
what
was
the
motivation
behind
the
institution
with
the
freedom
of
choice
plan.
but
in
this
case,
it's
not
necessary
to
guess
that.
it
set
forth
rather
explicitly
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
18,
i
may
read
a
sentence
or
two,
“since
there
are
about”
--
last
paragraph
on
page
18
--
“since
there
are
about
two
negro
students
for
each
white
student
in
this
school
district,
the
procedure
suggested
by
petitioners
as
a
feasible
alternative
to
freedom
of
choice
would
result
in
both
schools
being
predominantly
negro
if
the
white
students
continue
to
attend
them.
however,
most,
if
not
all,
would
be
withdrawn,
although
desegregation
is
an
accomplished
fact
in
this
district
and
every
white
child
is
attending
school
where
negro
students
exceed
20%
of
the
student
body,
the
white
parents
in
gould
would
be
no
more
willing
than
those
in
chicago,
washington
or
new
york
to
send
their
children
to
predominantly
negro
schools,”
so
that's
why
the
plan
was
adopted
here.
there's
--
this
is
offered
as
a
justification
on
basis
of
the
respondent's
case.
during
the
case,
a
school
construction
program
began
and
a
motion
was
made
at
trial
that
the
new
construction,
which
was
going
to
be
a
replacement
for
the
negro
high
school
building
that
was
built
in
1924,
be
put
on
the
white
campus
or
the
white
school
complex.
that
was
denied.
then,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
a
motion
was
made
that
since
the
school
already
had
been
completed
that
there
be
some
reallocation
of
the
function
of
facilities,
that
is
that
the
gould
complex
be
used
as
a
high
school
facility
completely
for
all
the
high
school
students
and
that
the
field
school
complex
be
used
as
an
elementary
school
complex.
it
turned
out
the
numbers
are
just
about
right.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
that
might
be
done
but
as
it
said,
this
was
not
the
time.
and
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
approved
what
was
done
by
the
respondent's
school
district
citing
with
approval
and
--
and
as
partial
justification
that
the
plan
and
its
operation
had
been
approved
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
which
a
procedure
has
been
adopted
by
respondent
after
more
than
ten
years
of
violating
the
requirements
of
brown
which
has
the
purpose
that's
stated
in
the
brief
and
has
had
the
result
of
continuing
the
existence
of
an
all
negro
school
complex
and
the
admission
of
small
and
stable
proportion
of
negro
children
to
a
formerly
all
white
school.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
my
position
would
be
the
same
but
it's
entirely
possible
that
condition
might
not
have
persisted
because
i
think
if
it
--
it
may
be.
i
--
this
has
never
happened
as
far
as
--
it
may
be
that
if
it
were
introduced
today
after
brown.
it
would
have
expressed
their
willingness
and
acceptance
on
the
part
of
the
community
to
do
something
about
this
rather
than
a
decade
of
hostility
and
tipathy
to
the
decision
which
discourages
freedom
of
choice.
but
that
to
me
is
so
hypothetical.
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
any
more
adequately
than
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
read
brown
to
report
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system.
now,
there
has
been
in
some
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
some
debate
over
integration
or
desegregation
or
compulsory
integration.
i
think
that
becomes
after
a
while
a
semantic
morass.
i
think
the
issue
is
what
are
the
available
alternatives?
what
are
the
options
a
school
district
may
exercise
to
end
up
with
a
school
system
which
is
as
far
as
possible
different
in
terms
of
racial
composition
or
racial
allocation
than
the
school
system
they
had
before
1954.
it
may
be
that
some
of
those
options
are
a
lot
feasible
or
not
attainable
in
terms
of
other
educational
considerations
or
expense.
that
may
or
may
not
be.
but
in
this
case,
indeed
in
most
instances,
there
are
available
options
and
we
think
those
options
should
be
--
the
option
which
produces
the
greatest
departure
from
the
preexisting
situation
should
be
used
rather
than
the
option
which
produces
the
least,
especially
where
the
option
was
produces
the
least
was
adopted
with
that
expectation
in
mind.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black,
the
typical
method
of
assigning
students
to
school
before
the
brown
decision
as
this
civil
rights
commission
report
here
shows,
and
the
typical
method
of
assigning
students
to
school
all
over
the
country
generally
has
been
just
to
assign
students
to
school
and
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that
being
assigned
to
a
school,
even
though
one
might
object
to
go
to
that
school
is
denied
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
we
face
the
question
of
disestablishing
a
system
which
has
been
run
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
it's
the
denial
of
anyone's
right
to
set
up
zones
or
allocation
of
school
facilities.
or
indeed
in
some
circumstances
as
our
brief
points
out,
perhaps
even
freedom
of
choice.
as
the
best
of
available
options
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
--
i
would
think
ordinarily
not,
no,
but
as
--
as
the
best
of
existing
ways
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
through
the
preexisting
unconstitutional
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
i
don't
think
since
the
case
is
all
about
race,
i
don't
think
you
can
put
race
out
of
your
head.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
--
i
would
say
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
yes,
though
i
would
assume
that
that
would
not
be
the
inexorable
and
overriding
fact
in
all
circumstances.
i
think
you'll
have
to
look
at
what
the
available
options
are.
in
this
situation
for
example
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
think
so,
yes.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
unscramble
--
i
don't
see
you
can
unscramble
a
racial
desegregated
situation
without
taking
race
about
how
you
doing
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
you
would
only
--
just
to
take
a
simple
hypothetical
case,
to
desegregate
a
school
--
in
desegregating
a
school
system,
you
could
draw
a
north
to
south
line
or
east
to
west
line.
you
will
see
one
would
keep
you
as
segregated
as
before
and
the
other
would
establish
substantial
integration.
given
those
two
options,
you
have
to
make
a
choice
and
i
would
assume
you'd
take
the
one
that
give
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
you
cannot
ignore
the
racial
consideration.
i
--
i
just
don't
--
and
i
don't
think
that
anyone
doing
it
actually
does
ignore
it.
to
me,
it's
inconceivable
with
someone
facing
a
situation
in
which
he's
trying
to
draw
a
school
--
redraw
school
zone
lines
somehow
that
puts
the
consideration
of
race
out
of
his
head.
i've
heard
children
play
a
game
and
would
--
with
--
which
one
tell
another
don't
think
of
an
elephant,
and
that's
of
course
all
they
do
is
think
of
an
elephant.
well,
you
can't
say
integrate
the
school
system
but
don't
think
about
race.
you
have
to
think
about
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
we
say
this
is
in
many
respects
like
anderson
against
martin
when
race
was
put
up
there
in
the
ballot
and
you
can't
go
into
the
ballot
box
and
then
vote
and
keep
that
out
of
your
mind
once
the
state
has
done
it.
but
i
might
say
that
in
this
case,
there's
more
than
that
involved.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
more
than
that
involved
because
we
don't
have
what
i
might
call
antiseptic
free
choice
here.
there's
a
great
deal
more
going
on,
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
not
involuntary,
mr.
justice
black,
in
a
sense
that
there
has
been
any
great
showing
of
intimidation
or
coercion.
there
perhaps
maybe
some
slightly
--
some
slight
showing
of
it,
but
it's
based
upon
what
you
might
extract
from
circumstances
that
one
reasonably
might
expect
to
have
deterring
influence
on
the
negro
children
and
families.
i
mean
for
example,
the
fact
of
maintenance
of
segregation
for
ten
years
after
brown,
i
think,
shows
what
the
attitude
of
the
school
district
is.
i
think
the
sending
of
the
28
children
back
after
they
showed
up
one
day
and
said,
“okay,
we've
got
free
choice.
can
we
come?”
and
then
they
said,
“no,
there's
no
room
for
you”
instead
of
using
some
neutral
--
some
neutral
factor.
the
segregation
of
faculty,
the
faculties
here
are
segregated
and
the
negro
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
wasn't
room
--
there
--
there
wasn't
room
for
them,
but
rather
than
use
some
neutral
standard
whereby
white
and
negro
children
would
be
judged
equally
as
being
qualified
to
fill
the
space
in
the
school,
the
negro
children
were
just
sent
back
because
they
were
the
applicants
coming
from
the
negro
school.
there
could
have
been
some
objective
standard
rather
than
the
fact
that
you
were
the
negro
who
came
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
were
just
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
was
never
considered.
they
just
sent
them
back.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
they
just
sent
them
back.
it
is
in
interesting
to
note
on
page
51
of
the
record,
and
i've
read
this
record
many
times
but
this
just
dawned
upon
me,
the
superintendent
refers
white
schools
our
school
but
the
negro
school
as
a
negro
school.
school
construction
was
undertaken
during
the
course
of
this
case,
which
tended
to
perpetuate
a
dual
school
complex.
the
--
the
--
the
worth
that
the
school
district
places
upon
the
negro
children
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
they
have
gone
to
unaccredited
schools
whereas
the
white
children
have
gone
to
accredited
schools.
now,
it
might
be
argued
that
notwithstanding
all
this,
all
these
circumstances,
freedom
of
choice
was
perhaps
justified
as
the
best
available
of
all
alternatives
to
reach
desegregation
where
it
might
be
argued
the
freedom
of
choice
was
like
more
economical
or
simpler
to
administer.
but
the
record
indicates
quite
the
contrary.
they're
running
two
sets
of
science
rooms.
they're
running
two
auditoriums
and
gymnasiums,
two
sets
of
cafeterias
under
the
new
system.
it
would
be
far
more
economical
to
divide
up
the
--
allocate
the
school
facilities
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
and
--
but
that's
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
obviously,
they
would
have
to
be
adhering
on
something
like
that.
but
certainly,
it
should
not
have
been
put
out
of
mind
and
out
of
hand
as
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jack
greenberg
could
not
send
the
children
to
a
private
school,
genuinely
private
school,
not
a
states-subsidized
private
school?
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
no.
i
would
think
that
introduces
other
considerations.
i
would
think
one
might
have
the
right
--
no
one
has
questioned
the
right
to
send
one's
child
to
a
genuinely
private
school
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
a
whole
series
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
that
that
--
or
anyone
has
ever
suggested
that.
i
think
the
pierce
case
and
those
other
cases
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
no,
it
wouldn't
reach
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
because
i
think
then,
some
other
principles
were
introduced
into
the
case
and
those
other
principles
to
me
suggest
that
again,
out
of
the
pierce
and
the
mayer
case
and
so
forth
that
parents
do
have
the
right
to
select
a
private
education
for
their
children
if
it
meets
certain
standards.
mr.
jack
greenberg
can
the
state
take
away
the
right
to
send
children
to
a
private
school?
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
confess
that
i
have
not
considered
that
to
be
an
issue
here.
i
have
not
adequately
thought
it
through.
i
just
wouldn't
know.
i
think
it
does
--
invoke
a
whole
additional
series
of
considerations
in
a
related
but
different
branch
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
in
conclusion,
the
basis
of
our
position
is
that
when
a
school
district
is
faced
with
the
task
of
remedying
preexisting
segregation,
one
must
look
at
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
options,
what
are
the
alternatives,
and
which
of
them
consistent
with
educational
principles
and
economic
considerations
is
more
likely
to
achieve
the
maximum
integration
or
desegregation
if
you
will.
in
this
case,
i
think
that's
--
the
answer
is
rather
clear
indeed.
i
think
it
is
in
all
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
today.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
i
--
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
--
would
announce
that
there's
a
positive
duty
on
the
part
of
the
school
systems
to
disestablish
preexisting
segregated
systems,
that
it's
not
enough
to
merely
announce
something
which
is
called
freedom
of
choice,
that
where
various
alternatives
are
available
such
as
drawing
of
school
district
lines
or
reallocating
facilities
as
between
elementary
and
secondary
school
use.
those
options
should
be
canvassed
and
the
one
which
is
likely
to
achieve
the
greatest
amount
of
integration
and
assuming
that
it's
all
consistent
with
other
educational
factors
should
--
should
be
employed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
in
such
cases
though.
as
i
said,
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
may
be
there
are
some
communities
where
residential
segregation
is
so
rigid
that
freedom
of
choice
perhaps
might
be
the
only
way
to
--
to
eliminate
the
preexisting
system.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
the
traditional
flexibility
of
a
court
of
equity
here
and
i
think
the
general
principles
are
--
are
not
at
least
as
i've
suggested
and
terribly
difficult.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
believe
that
mr.
gray
is
going
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
your
honor,
he's
going
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
moment
remaining,
i
like
just
to
make
several
points.
i
think
these
cases
come
down
to
several
propositions
among
which
i
think
the
most
prominent
one
is
of
whether
or
not
a
school
system
has
disestablished
segregation
when
it
continues
to
remain
in
existence,
the
all
negro
school
which
is
the
symbol
of
the
segregated
system
in
circumstances
when
steps
can
be
taken
--
quite
reasonable
steps
can
be
taken
to
end
that
situation.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
perhaps
just
for
the
moment
to
the
proposition
that
has
been
mentioned
several
times
today,
the
possibility
that
something
like
free
choice
may
be
a
constitutional
right.
if
that
is
so,
it's
certainly
has
not
been
articulated
previously.
it
certainly
appears
nowhere
explicitly
in
the
constitution.
and
finally,
if
it
were
the
case,
it
would
totally
upset
the
administration
of
school
systems
throughout
the
county
because
most
of
them
traditionally
for
generations
have
operated
upon
a
basis
of
assigning
children.
finally,
i
may
be
permitted
a
personal
reference
that
was
a
quotation
from
race
relations
in
american
law
and
it's
to
that
where
some
reference
to
statements
out
of
context
i
might
say
i
did
not
know
then
what
i
know
now.
and
if
i
had
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
no.
if
--
yes,
if
i
had
known
it,
i
would
have
stated
the
matter
somewhat
differently.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
not
have
written
that
section
of
the
book.
now,
i
think
i
would
have
written
it
but
i
would
have
stated
things
differently.
actually,
i
think
it
is
somewhat
out
of
context
but
i
would
not
have
written
anything
susceptible
to
such
an
interpretation.
finally,
this
entire
question
of
flight
in
connection
with
this
proposition
being
raised
in
the
brief,
we
did
a
bit
of
research
on
just
how
many
majority
school
districts
there
are
in
united
states
or
at
least
in
the
region
of
the
country
that
would
be
affected
by
this
decision.
of
the
approximately
6,000
school
district's
in
the
seventeen
sovereign
and
border
states,
303
approximately
5%
have
negro
student
majorities
and
even
smaller
percentage
have
60%
negro
student
bodies.
so
the
matters,
as
a
practical
matter,
are
not
of
any
great
consequence.
as
a
matter
of
principle,
however,
it
invokes
the
considerations
and
the
statement
of
the
brown
case
that
hostility
may
not
be
grounds
for
refusing
to
abide
by
this
decision,
reiterated
in
cooper
against
aaron
and
ultimately
the
proposition
of
when
this
court
expounds
the
constitution,
it
states
a
proposition
and
the
principle
which
is
a
practical
matter
at
any
given
moment
may
not
be
actually
attainable
but
something
that
we
at
least
want
to
work
towards
and
that
proposition
as
i
see
brown
is
official
being
one
country
rather
than
two
and
that
we
should
not
acquiesce
in
various
schemes
and
devices
to
frustrate
the
principle
of
the
brown
decision
which
i
think
is
perhaps
the
greatest
thing
ever
to
happen
--
to
come
out
of
this
court
in
the
history
of
the
nation.
