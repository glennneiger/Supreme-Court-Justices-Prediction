justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
light,
are
there
any
white
students
in
field
elementary
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
reason
why.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
be
the
reason
for
that?
could
it
possibly
be
that
the
white
parents
don't
want
to
send
their
children
to
a
school
that
paid
45,000
to
build
an
education
part
of
the
school
and
82,000
for
the
gymnasium?
could
it
be
that
they
didn't
--
they'd
rather
go
to
a
nice
school
rather
than
a
nice
gymnasium?
could
that
be
a
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
like
to
point
out
to
page
five
of
your
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
have
been
the
reason.
they'd
rather
not
send
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
better
than
the
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then,
why
do
people
have
a
lawsuit
against
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
you're
going
with
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
light,
but
here
you
should
know
as
an
old
baltimorean,
nobody
ever
knew
about
it.
it
was
there
but
nobody
ever
knew
until
after
the
brown
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did
have
it
in
arkansas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
didn't
have
it
in
gould?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
get
it
until
you're
up
against
the
wall.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we'll
leave
it
at
1965.
and
you
could
have
taken
the
two
and
combined
the
two
schools
together,
the
two
campuses
physically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
have
made
one
elementary
and
one
high
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
1954
when
you
built
the
field
elementary
school,
you
could
have
built
that
around
the
campus
with
gould.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
have
a
right
to
build
your
school
building
wherever
you
want
to
build
them.
but
you
could
have
made
one
large
elementary
school
and
one
large
high
school
and
you
put
everybody
in
the
same
school
without
much
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
one
other
possibility.
you
could
have
drawn
the
line
four
blocks
from
each
one
of
the
schools
and
said
everybody
on
that
side
go
into
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could
put
four
blocks
in
either
one
of
them,
you'd
be
in
the
middle,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
once
you
draw
the
line,
you
could
go
right
down
to
the
middle
of
the
county
and
detour
a
penitentiary
and
set
everybody
on
this
side
and
everybody
on
this
side
goes
to
the
other
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
finally,
once
you
did
that
to
consider
both
of
them
is
your
school
rather
than
just
the
gould
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
private
schools
do
you
have
in
your
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
part,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand.
that's
over
with
now
too
because
they
weren't
private.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
old
county
would
try
to
deal
with
prince
edward
county
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
court
found
that
that
was
wrong,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
wouldn't
think
of
doing
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
look
into
the
future
about
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
for
your
county
to
reach
the
point
where
they
wouldn't
mind
the
white
children
attending
the
school
and
there's
two
to
one
nature
--
but
how
long
do
you
think
your
county
would
get
around
at
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't
mr.
arthur
lee
raney
--
he
isn't
not
interested
and
that
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you're
not
speaking
to
all
the
negroes,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
saying
that
they
want
to
be
themselves
in
their
own
little
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
let's
all
be
happy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
negroes
do
you
know
in
that
county
personally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
approximately
because
you're
speaking
for
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
whom
you
just
said
--
i
thought
you
said
you're
speaking
for
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
mr.
greenberg.
i'm
talking
about
you.
you
said
that
the
negroes
in
gould
love
to
be
by
themselves
in
their
own
school
building.
you
didn't
say
some.
you
really
mean
some,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know?
you
don't
know
why
they're
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
first
assigned
--
the
children
in
field
were
first
assigned
there,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
do
they
get
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
they
have
to
have
to
sign.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean
but
it's
up
to
them.
they
have
to
make
the
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
to
make
the
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
residential
segregation
in
gould?
the
answer
is
no,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
white
and
colored
children
play
together?
they
sometimes
eat
together
and
the
only
time
they're
segregated
is
in
school
and
in
church.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
never
seen
white
and
colored
kids
playing
together
in
that
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
seen
white
and
colored
kids
playing
in
little
rock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
streets,
the
nearby
place
where
they
live.
i'm
trying
to
get
where
you've
got
this
hostility
from.
you
said
they'll
be
hostile
to
each
other.
where
do
they
get
the
hostility,
from
the
church
or
the
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
an
expert
on
that
but
we
do
know
that
there
is
tension
and
we've
seen
it
and
you
see
it
in
the
daily
newspapers
the
other
day
and
where
they
got
it?
i
don't
know.
reverting
to
the
educational
significance
of
this,
it's
been
called
to
my
attention
this
morning
that
it
was
put
in
the
congressional
record
yesterday
by
congressman
fountain,
page
e2532.
the
same
article
that
the
attorney
for
the
school
board
in
tennessee
case
printed
as
an
appendix
to
his
appendix
i
believe
he
would
call
it.
that
is
as
excellent
a
summary
of
absolutely
impartial
professional
observers
about
the
practical
effects
on
education
of
the
school
desegregation
process
i've
ever
seen.
in
that
article,
there
is
a
full
biography
of
the
authors
of
the
article
in
the
congressional
record
insertion
and
i
commend
that
to
the
board
for
its
consideration
on
this
regard.
the
solicitor
general
has
considerably
changed
his
view
apparently
since
the
goss
case
in
1963,
only
five
years
ago
about
freedom
of
choice
as
a
device
to
resolve
the
problem
which
school
district
like
this
is
confronted.
he
argued
in
that
case
goss
involved
two
tennessee
seats
and
he
argued
in
that
case
that
the
school
board
had
a
final
alternative
to
this
plan
that
was
brought
before
this
court
and
attack.
it
can
take
full
freedom
of
choice
and
the
particular
merit
and
say
that
would
be
a
constitutional
alternative,
no
question
about
it.
and
the
particular
merit
by
the
way,
this
material
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
goss
is
in
my
brief
in
this
case
at
page
50.
the
particular
merit
of
freedom
of
choice
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
lynn
is
that
it
would
avoid
any
child,
negro
or
white
from
being
confronted
with
the
mandatory
prospect
of
having
to
go
to
the
school
that
was
predominantly
populated
by
the
other
race.
this
is
a
serious
educational
consideration
and
the
solicitor
general
was
much
more
realistic
about
this
practical
problem
at
that
time.
i
would
like
to
suggest
further
that
the
alternatives
that
our
adversary
suggests,
all
of
them
are
suggested
for
purely
racial
reasons
to
achieve
a
purely
racial
result
and
the
only
reason
to
offer
an
alternative.
they
don't
attack
freedom
of
choice
per
se.
if
they
don't
like
the
result,
it's
achieved
in
this
particular
instance
and
so
they
offer
an
alternative
to
achieve
a
different
result,
a
racial
result.
that
--
those
alternatives
that
they
offer
do
not
square
with
this
court's
insistence
that
the
state
be
neutral
in
matters
of
race.
that's
the
proper
position
for
the
state
to
take.
it
must
maintain
a
neutrality.
the
solicitor
general
says
in
his
brief
although
in
evans
v.
newton,
the
court
said,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
wrote
this
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
must
be
neutral
in
racial
matters.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
in
his
brief
here
that
neutrality
is
not
enough
and
pursues
the
argument
along
that
line.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
true
that
what
you
really
say
is
that
if
a
white
child
wants
to
--
white
parents
who
want
to
send
their
children
to
the
negro
school,
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
make
that
choice
and
send
this
child
to
that
school,
the
negro
school
and
then
come
home
and
take
his
chances
with
his
neighbors
and
this
employer
--
and
this
employer
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
light,
are
there
any
white
students
in
field
elementary
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
reason
why.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
be
the
reason
for
that?
could
it
possibly
be
that
the
white
parents
don't
want
to
send
their
children
to
a
school
that
paid
45,000
to
build
an
education
part
of
the
school
and
82,000
for
the
gymnasium?
could
it
be
that
they
didn't
--
they'd
rather
go
to
a
nice
school
rather
than
a
nice
gymnasium?
could
that
be
a
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
like
to
point
out
to
page
five
of
your
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
have
been
the
reason.
they'd
rather
not
send
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
better
than
the
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then,
why
do
people
have
a
lawsuit
against
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
you're
going
with
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
light,
but
here
you
should
know
as
an
old
baltimorean,
nobody
ever
knew
about
it.
it
was
there
but
nobody
ever
knew
until
after
the
brown
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did
have
it
in
arkansas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
didn't
have
it
in
gould?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
get
it
until
you're
up
against
the
wall.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we'll
leave
it
at
1965.
and
you
could
have
taken
the
two
and
combined
the
two
schools
together,
the
two
campuses
physically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
have
made
one
elementary
and
one
high
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
1954
when
you
built
the
field
elementary
school,
you
could
have
built
that
around
the
campus
with
gould.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
have
a
right
to
build
your
school
building
wherever
you
want
to
build
them.
but
you
could
have
made
one
large
elementary
school
and
one
large
high
school
and
you
put
everybody
in
the
same
school
without
much
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
one
other
possibility.
you
could
have
drawn
the
line
four
blocks
from
each
one
of
the
schools
and
said
everybody
on
that
side
go
into
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could
put
four
blocks
in
either
one
of
them,
you'd
be
in
the
middle,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
once
you
draw
the
line,
you
could
go
right
down
to
the
middle
of
the
county
and
detour
a
penitentiary
and
set
everybody
on
this
side
and
everybody
on
this
side
goes
to
the
other
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
finally,
once
you
did
that
to
consider
both
of
them
is
your
school
rather
than
just
the
gould
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
private
schools
do
you
have
in
your
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
part,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand.
that's
over
with
now
too
because
they
weren't
private.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
old
county
would
try
to
deal
with
prince
edward
county
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
court
found
that
that
was
wrong,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
wouldn't
think
of
doing
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
look
into
the
future
about
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
for
your
county
to
reach
the
point
where
they
wouldn't
mind
the
white
children
attending
the
school
and
there's
two
to
one
nature
--
but
how
long
do
you
think
your
county
would
get
around
at
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't
mr.
arthur
lee
raney
--
he
isn't
not
interested
and
that
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you're
not
speaking
to
all
the
negroes,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
saying
that
they
want
to
be
themselves
in
their
own
little
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
let's
all
be
happy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
negroes
do
you
know
in
that
county
personally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
approximately
because
you're
speaking
for
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
whom
you
just
said
--
i
thought
you
said
you're
speaking
for
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
mr.
greenberg.
i'm
talking
about
you.
you
said
that
the
negroes
in
gould
love
to
be
by
themselves
in
their
own
school
building.
you
didn't
say
some.
you
really
mean
some,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know?
you
don't
know
why
they're
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
first
assigned
--
the
children
in
field
were
first
assigned
there,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
do
they
get
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
they
have
to
have
to
sign.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean
but
it's
up
to
them.
they
have
to
make
the
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
to
make
the
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
residential
segregation
in
gould?
the
answer
is
no,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
white
and
colored
children
play
together?
they
sometimes
eat
together
and
the
only
time
they're
segregated
is
in
school
and
in
church.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
never
seen
white
and
colored
kids
playing
together
in
that
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
seen
white
and
colored
kids
playing
in
little
rock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
streets,
the
nearby
place
where
they
live.
i'm
trying
to
get
where
you've
got
this
hostility
from.
you
said
they'll
be
hostile
to
each
other.
where
do
they
get
the
hostility,
from
the
church
or
the
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
an
expert
on
that
but
we
do
know
that
there
is
tension
and
we've
seen
it
and
you
see
it
in
the
daily
newspapers
the
other
day
and
where
they
got
it?
i
don't
know.
reverting
to
the
educational
significance
of
this,
it's
been
called
to
my
attention
this
morning
that
it
was
put
in
the
congressional
record
yesterday
by
congressman
fountain,
page
e2532.
the
same
article
that
the
attorney
for
the
school
board
in
tennessee
case
printed
as
an
appendix
to
his
appendix
i
believe
he
would
call
it.
that
is
as
excellent
a
summary
of
absolutely
impartial
professional
observers
about
the
practical
effects
on
education
of
the
school
desegregation
process
i've
ever
seen.
in
that
article,
there
is
a
full
biography
of
the
authors
of
the
article
in
the
congressional
record
insertion
and
i
commend
that
to
the
board
for
its
consideration
on
this
regard.
the
solicitor
general
has
considerably
changed
his
view
apparently
since
the
goss
case
in
1963,
only
five
years
ago
about
freedom
of
choice
as
a
device
to
resolve
the
problem
which
school
district
like
this
is
confronted.
he
argued
in
that
case
goss
involved
two
tennessee
seats
and
he
argued
in
that
case
that
the
school
board
had
a
final
alternative
to
this
plan
that
was
brought
before
this
court
and
attack.
it
can
take
full
freedom
of
choice
and
the
particular
merit
and
say
that
would
be
a
constitutional
alternative,
no
question
about
it.
and
the
particular
merit
by
the
way,
this
material
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
goss
is
in
my
brief
in
this
case
at
page
50.
the
particular
merit
of
freedom
of
choice
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
lynn
is
that
it
would
avoid
any
child,
negro
or
white
from
being
confronted
with
the
mandatory
prospect
of
having
to
go
to
the
school
that
was
predominantly
populated
by
the
other
race.
this
is
a
serious
educational
consideration
and
the
solicitor
general
was
much
more
realistic
about
this
practical
problem
at
that
time.
i
would
like
to
suggest
further
that
the
alternatives
that
our
adversary
suggests,
all
of
them
are
suggested
for
purely
racial
reasons
to
achieve
a
purely
racial
result
and
the
only
reason
to
offer
an
alternative.
they
don't
attack
freedom
of
choice
per
se.
if
they
don't
like
the
result,
it's
achieved
in
this
particular
instance
and
so
they
offer
an
alternative
to
achieve
a
different
result,
a
racial
result.
that
--
those
alternatives
that
they
offer
do
not
square
with
this
court's
insistence
that
the
state
be
neutral
in
matters
of
race.
that's
the
proper
position
for
the
state
to
take.
it
must
maintain
a
neutrality.
the
solicitor
general
says
in
his
brief
although
in
evans
v.
newton,
the
court
said,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
wrote
this
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
must
be
neutral
in
racial
matters.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
in
his
brief
here
that
neutrality
is
not
enough
and
pursues
the
argument
along
that
line.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
true
that
what
you
really
say
is
that
if
a
white
child
wants
to
--
white
parents
who
want
to
send
their
children
to
the
negro
school,
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
make
that
choice
and
send
this
child
to
that
school,
the
negro
school
and
then
come
home
and
take
his
chances
with
his
neighbors
and
this
employer
--
and
this
employer
--
