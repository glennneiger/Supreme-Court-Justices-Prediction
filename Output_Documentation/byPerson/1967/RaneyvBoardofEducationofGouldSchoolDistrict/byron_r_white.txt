justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
do
that,
it's
--
your
position
is
that
it's
perfectly
permissible
to
draw
a
school
zone
line
based
on
racial
consideration.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
bad
to
draw
school
zone
lines
based
on
race
to
segregate
but
it's
perfectly
--
it
is
alright
to
eliminate
that
to
draw
a
school
zone
line
based
on
race
to
indicate
in
order
to
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
desegregate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
some
circumstances,
it
is
permissible
to
have
a
--
to
have
state
action
based
on
racial
consideration.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
right.
of
course
you
could
say
that
to
desegregate,
you
should
draw
school
zone
lines
on
neutral
factors,
not
in
regard
to
race
at
all.
but
you
say
no,
you
may
draw
this
zone
line
based
on
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
a
lot
of
--
certainly,
there
are
a
lot
of
school
districts
where
there
are
no
racial
problems
at
all
one
way
or
another,
and
there's
a
problem
with
drawing
with
zone
lines,
and
the
zone
lines
are
drawn
without
regard
to
the
race.
they're
base
on
all
sorts
of
other
things,
i
suppose,
opacity,
geographical
factors,
and
i
suppose
that
even
in
a
city
where
there
are
racial
problems,
where
there
has
been
segregation,
you
could
draw
school
zone
lines
based
on
those
so-called
neutral
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
that
would
not
be
permissible
against
a
background
like
this
but
the
school
zone
line
must
be
drawn
on
a
racial
--
with
a
racial
consideration
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
--
that
assumes
that
you're
going
to
integrate
the
school
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
argument
leads
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
given
volunteer
choices.
this
is
what
you
have
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
position
extend
to
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
the
--
the
court
should
have
--
or
could
and
should
also
limit
the
freedom
of
choice
so
that
parents
could
not
send
their
children
to
private
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
reason
for
sending
it
--
for
the
parents
sending
the
child
to
the
private
school
was
that
there
no
negroes
in
the
school
or
no
whites
for
that
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
have
--
i
just
wanted
--
wouldn't
your
--
would
your
principle
reach
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
applied
to
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
in
the
record
that's
obliged
here
with
the
clerk?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
what
if
old
fashioned
neighborhood
zoning
produced
no
integration
at
all
or
perhaps
the
segregation
where
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
to
say
that
both
are
to
favor
that
you
assume
that
if
the
--
if
some
alternative
plan
were
adopted,
you
can
either
say
the
whites
would
not
move
out
or
if
they
would,
it's
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
question,
wholly
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
you
say
that
that
is
a
matter
of
fact,
you
dispute
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
accepted
it,
would
you
say
it's
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
fact,
the
decision
that
there
are
children
are
made
on
the
basis
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
suppose
that
to
be
true?
justice
byron

white
and
--
and
so
the
state
is

if
