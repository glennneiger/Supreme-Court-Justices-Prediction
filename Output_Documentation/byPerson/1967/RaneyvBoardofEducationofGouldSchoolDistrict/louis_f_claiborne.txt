mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
might
be
helpful
at
this
stage
to
summarize
the
context
in
so
far
as
it's
common
to
these
three
cases.
as
the
united
states
views
these
cases,
they
present
three
situations
very
alike
and
that,
in
each
one,
normal,
old
fashioned
geographic
zoning
would
achieve
either
a
substantial
measure
or
complete
desegregation
school
district
and
yet,
this
long
after
brown
in
each
of
these
three
schools
districts,
80%
to
85%
of
the
negro
children
attend
all
negro
schools.
at
each
and
every
one
of
the
previously
all
negro
schools
in
each
of
these
school
districts
remains
today
absolutely
100%
a
negro
school.
it
is
that
persistence
of
racial
segregation
that
each
of
these
districts
it
seems
to
us
calls
for
a
remedy.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
compulsory
integration
and
the
challenge
to
freedom
of
choice
is
characterized
as
advocacy
of
compulsory
integration.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
a
false
issue
as
it
applies
to
these
cases.
we're
not
talking
here
about
busting
or
any
other
extraordinary
measures
to
accomplish
a
racial
balance
in
the
schools
of
the
districts.
we're
merely
suggesting
the
old
fashion
traditional
system
of
neighborhood
schools
of
geographic
zoning
be
followed
here
as
if
no
doubt
would
have
been
followed
except
for
the
effort
to
escape
the
racial
integration
that
would
follow
from
such
geographic
zoning.
to
hear
the
respondent's
one
would
suppose
that
there
were
some
sort
of
constitutional
right
to
children
to
choose
their
own
schools.
there
is
of
course
no
such
right
and
that
fact
is
in
this
country
for
a
century
has
been
to
resign
the
children
to
the
school
even
there
is
their
home
or
on
some
other
basis
but
without
giving
them
any
absolute
freedom
as
to
which
school
they
wish
to
pick.
one
would
suppose
that
the
brown
decision
had
condemned
not
racial
segregation
but
compulsory
assignment.
shortly,
brown
did
not
condemn
the
old
system
of
assigning
children
to
a
school
in
the
best
interest
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
all
it
condemned
was
the
system
of
racial
assignments,
not
the
system
with
compulsory
assignments.
now,
it's
one
thing
and
bad
enough
if
the
school
districts
after
these
many
years
in
maintaining
segregation,
want
to
wash
their
hands
at
the
problem
and
leave
it
up
to
the
students
or
leave
it
up
with
somebody
else
to
repair
the
damage
that
have
been
done.
but
that's
not
even
to
this
case.
they're
not
simply
washing
their
hand
at
the
problem.
they're
not
simply
advocating
responsibility
which
it
seems
to
us
is
theirs
under
the
circumstances
and
in
light
of
the
history.
they're
going
--
taking
affirmative
steps.
they're
going
very
far
out
of
their
way
to
create,
to
make
it
possible
of
resegregation
or
a
perpetuation
of
segregation
within
the
school
districts.
they're
not
simply
letting
the
assignments
fall
as
they
would
naturally
by
geographic
zoning.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
seems
to
us,
mr.
justice
white,
presents
a
quite
different
problem.
i
don't
say
that
we
wouldn't
in
that
case
argue
that
at
least
against
the
background
of
enforced
racial
segregation.
there
weren't
some
offended
duty
on
the
school
board
to
take
measures
or
at
least
to
avoid
as
between
equal
alternatives.
that
alternative
which
is
least
likely
to
produce
an
end
of
the
new
school
system
but
that
is
not
what's
involved
here
as
i
say.
rather
these
school
boards
have
taken
quite
extraordinary
measures
to
avoid
the
natural
result
that
would
follow.
we
condemn
freedom
of
choice
here
in
this
context
where
it
does
seem
to
us
to
be
an
artificial
device
to
delay,
to
retard,
even
to
defeat
the
segregation.
first,
because
it's
so
obviously
artificial,
it
is
not
a
traditional
method
of
assigning,
at
least
in
the
south
of
assigning
elementary
and
high
school
students,
whatever
it
may
be,
college
area.
it
does
seem
to
be
educational
nonsense.
it's
a
pure
haphazard
system
in
theory
which
takes
no
account
of
what
things
they
might
be
desirable
from
educational
point
of
view.
at
least
in
those
cases
where
it
requires
long
distance
bussing
as
in
new
kent,
virginia
and
in
gould,
arkansas.
it
imposes
a
special
financial
burden
on
the
school
district
and
of
course,
it's
an
administrative
nightmare
if
it
works
as
it
should
in
theory
because
not
only
do
you
have
forms,
letters
to
be
sent
out,
receive,
tabulate,
count,
all
of
which
would
be
unnecessary.
if
the
school
board
to
simply
assign
as
it
used
to
on
the
basis
of
residence,
but
the
results
are
unpredictable
from
year
to
year.
school
construction
can't
proceed
on
any
intelligent
basis
if,
as
i
say,
it
worked
as
it's
supposed
to
in
theory
and
the
results
were
truly
unpredictable.
of
course,
the
fact
is
that
freedom
of
choice
is
not
supposed
to
work
toward
the
segregation.
if
it
did,
it
would
be
self-defeating
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
office
because
pretty
soon,
the
white
school
to
which
all
the
negroes
would
transfer
would
become
overcrowded.
the
negro
school
would
have
to
be
closed,
and
the
whole
theory
of
freedom
of
choice
would
be
ended
and
there
would
be
no
free
assignment
or
free
choice.
they
would
then
have
to
be
compulsory
assignments
on
the
basis
of
proximity
to
school.
this
fact
alone
shows
that
freedom
of
choice
is
not
supposed
to
work
in
the
sense
of
achieving
desegregation.
it
is
calculated
on
the
theory
that
the
whites
will
all
choose
to
attend
the
white
schools
and
that
very
few
negroes
will
overcome
the
burden
and
have
the
courage
to
take
the
adventure
into
a
school
where
they
have
been
shunned,
where
they
don't
expect
to
be
welcomed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
of
these
--
in
one
of
these
cases,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
figures
are
from
80%
to
85%
who
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
did
accomplish
that
much.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
are
not
playing
a
game
of
statistics
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
it
is
relevant
to
what
results
are
achieved.
if
good
results
are
achieved
the
method
even
though
seemingly
bad
is
harmless.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
results
are
so
insubstantial
as
they
are
here,
then
one
begins
to
look
to
see
if
some
other
method
would
not
achieve
better
results.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
figure
alone
will
not
find
meaningless,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
have
to
test
it
against
what
the
result
would
be
if
another
alternative
were
followed
especially
when
the
other
alternative
is
cheaper,
simpler,
more
customary
and
when
i
find
that
that
other
alternative
reproduced
50%
integration,
then
i've
condemned
the
20%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
the
gould
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
raney
as
the
gould
case
number
805,
gould,
arkansas,
either
of
the
two
methods
already
mentioned,
one
would
be
drawing
a
geographical
line
down
in
the
middle
as
mr.
justice
marshall
put
it
four
blocks
from
each
of
the
schools
right
down
the
middle
of
separating
this
district
into
two
zones
and
assigning
of
the
students
on
the
basis
of
geography
or
alternatively
qince
this
is
a
system
with
so
few
students,
one
would
suppose
that
economic
and
educational
considerations
would
normally
leave
the
school
district
if
race
were
not
involved
to
consolidate
or
pay
and
have
one
of
the
buildings
used
for
the
high
school
and
the
other
use
for
the
elementary
school
for
every
one
in
the
district.
that
latter
system,
of
course,
would
produce
total
desegregation
and
we
are
told
that
there's
a
little
residential
segregation
within
this
district
so
we
can
presume
that
a
fairly
drawn
geographic
zoning
system
would
likewise
produce
the
substantial
degree
of
this
occasion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
even
that
far
mr.
justice
fortas
because
here,
it's
not,
these
are
not
equal
alternatives.
this
is
so
obviously
a
cumbersome
out
of
the
way
transparent
device
to
drift
on
desegregation
that
they
don't
have
to
say
what
would
be
the
result
if
it
was
a
question
of
consolidation
versus
geographic
zoning
and
condemn
one
of
the
other
depending
on
resulting
statistics.
here,
there
is
an
extraordinary
effort
by
the
state
action
not
only
to
advocate
whatever
responsibility
they
may
be
in
the
school
district
to
repair,
to
compensate
for
the
discrimination
of
repairs
but
a
devising
of
a
scheme
which
allows
race
to
control
assignment
of
students.
albeit,
race
in
terms
of
the
exercise
of
private
prejudice
rather
than
the
school
board
itself
during
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
in
each
case
--
so
80%
to
85%
of
the
negroes
go
to
schools
in
which
they
are
the
white
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
submit,
there
maybe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
integrated
in
a
token
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
let
me
point
out
that
this
free
choice
which
is
spoken
of
as
though
we
were
asking
that
the
negroes
and
the
whites
be
denied.
it
seems
unfair
--
no
one
has
ever
asked
the
negroes
in
these
negro
schools
whether
they
would
object
to
the
assignment
of
the
white
students
there
until
that
point
comes,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
they
had
been
--
they
would
be
denied
the
right
to
go
to
school
alone.
there
are
of
course
obvious
in
many
reasons
why
the
negro
is
reluctant
to
take
the
advantage
into
the
white
school
and
the
system
works
so
as
to
put
the
entire
burden
on
here.
the
white
assigns
himself
back
to
his
old
school
where
he
is
familiar.
the
negro
is
expected
to
leave
the
familiar
surroundings
and
to
go
to
a
school
where
he
is
led
to
believe
right
or
wrong
that
he
will
be
shown
--
that
he
will
be
unwelcome
and
at
all
events,
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
a
move.
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
break
with
the
comfortable
customary
surrounding
and
that
in
itself
is
unfair.
all
these
would
be
tolerable
if
it
were
necessary,
if
it
were
unavoidable
but
it's
not
only
unnecessary
unavoidable,
it's
a
manufactured
burden
that
could
so
easily
by
employing
traditional
and
customary
method
of
assignment
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
to
say
first
mr.
justice
white
that
that
frightening
prospect
which
is
always
put
forward
in
these
cases,
tends
to
argue
against
any
desegregation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
have
no
basis
on
which
to
dispute
whether
in
this
particular
school
district
it
would
or
would
not
happen.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
it
were
irrelevant
even
if
it
works.
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
more
school
district
is
subjected
to
the
same
constitutional
standard,
the
less
place
there
is
to
flee
to.
the
more
tuition
aide
to
so-called
private
schools
are
stricken
down,
the
less
attractive
the
alternative
private
schooling
becomes
and
it
works
perhaps
a
little
bit
like
the
public
accommodation
law
of
--
if
everybody
has
to
desegregate
and
there's
no
place
else
to
go.
pretty
soon,
people
stay
where
they
once
were
and
i
would
hope
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
as
to
the
first,
it
is
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
there
is
no
basis
on
which
--
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
a
remand
to
reconsider
the
propriety
of
freedom
of
choice
in
those
two
districts
nor
of
the
free
transfer
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
what
as
to
wait
what
--
what
final
solution
ought
to
be
adopted
whether
geographic
zoning
or
pairing
a
consolidation
as
to
that
matter,
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
the
first
instance
a
matter
for
the
district
court
or
perhaps
the
school
board
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
think
this
court
should
condemn
freedom
of
choice
as
an
alternative
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
but
those
two.
i
don't
know
that
it
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
all
those
two
that
is
pairing
and
geographic
zoning.
i
would
not
suppose
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
choose
between
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
leave
it
perhaps
a
bit
more
open
and
if
the
district
court
could
device
some
plan
which
i
haven't
thought
of
which
might
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
suggest
that
this
court
ought
to
prescribe
the
précised
plan
which
any
given
district
ought
to
apply.
i
do
think
it
is
both
appropriate
that
fitting
that
this
court
do
condemn
freedom
of
choice
as
applied
in
this
sort
of
circumstance.
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
we
do
not
challenge
freedom
of
choice
in
all
circumstances
as
i
think
mr.
greenberg
mentioned
in
those
situations
where
residential
patterns
of
segregation
are
so
strict
that
geographic
zoning
would
produce
a
high
degree
of
segregation
of
--
freedom
of
choice
can
certainly
do
no
harm
and
it
may
do
substantial
good.
now
finally,
i
want
to
stress
that
because
this
is
such
a
transparent
device
to
unable
the
white
students
primarily
and
their
parents
to
segregate
or
continue
desegregation
of
the
school
system
in
a
way
that
the
state
itself
could
not.
because
everybody
understands
that
that's
the
reason
why
this
plan
was
resorted
to
and
because
that
message
has
been
gone
across
both
to
the
negro
community
and
the
white
community.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
appears
at
least
to
be
applauding,
to
be
encouraging,
to
be
at
least
sanctioning
and
approving
a
choice
made
on
the
basis
of
place.
since
this
is
a
device
to
permit
the
white
students
to
find
themselves
a
haven
away
from
their
normal
assignment
in
a
school
which
is
mostly
negro
and
since
the
state
has
gone
to
such
extraordinary
lands
and
put
such
a
burden
on
itself
to
make
this
choice
available,
it
has
thereby
indicated
to
all
members
of
the
community
that
this
is
a
legitimate
and
proper
basis
on
which
to
choose
your
school
and
thereby
it
seems
to
me
it
has
hardened
those
racials
--
racial
attitudes
which
is
our
purpose
of
educational
desegregation
to
relax
and
it
has
also
compounded
the
injury
on
the
negro
children.
it's
bad
enough
to
be
segregated
off
to
have
that
as
the
accidental
consequence
of
geographic
zoning
which
is
wholly
neutral
is
one
thing
but
to
have
it
as
the
consequence
of
a
deliberate
policy
sanctioned
by
the
state
being
shunned
by
the
white
students
who
live
next
door
to
them
and
makes
the
injury
that
much
more
severe.
that
is
the
injury
which
the
brown
decision
is
concerned
about,
that
injury
which
is
that
much
worse
when
it
seems
to
have
the
sanction,
the
approval
state
behind
it.
now
finally
and
to
conclude,
let
me
repeat
what
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
in
these
cases
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
the
school
board
had
an
affirmative
obligation
to
take
special
measures
to
achieve
racial
balance.
that
is
not
our
argument
here.
our
argument
is
rather
that
the
state
must
at
least
avoid
resorting
to
extraordinary
measures
which
can
only
be
in
their
purpose
and
effect
defeat
or
retard
desegregation.
on
this
submission,
we
suggest
that
in
all
the
three
cases,
the
judgments
below
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
might
be
helpful
at
this
stage
to
summarize
the
context
in
so
far
as
it's
common
to
these
three
cases.
as
the
united
states
views
these
cases,
they
present
three
situations
very
alike
and
that,
in
each
one,
normal,
old
fashioned
geographic
zoning
would
achieve
either
a
substantial
measure
or
complete
desegregation
school
district
and
yet,
this
long
after
brown
in
each
of
these
three
schools
districts,
80%
to
85%
of
the
negro
children
attend
all
negro
schools.
at
each
and
every
one
of
the
previously
all
negro
schools
in
each
of
these
school
districts
remains
today
absolutely
100%
a
negro
school.
it
is
that
persistence
of
racial
segregation
that
each
of
these
districts
it
seems
to
us
calls
for
a
remedy.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
compulsory
integration
and
the
challenge
to
freedom
of
choice
is
characterized
as
advocacy
of
compulsory
integration.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
a
false
issue
as
it
applies
to
these
cases.
we're
not
talking
here
about
busting
or
any
other
extraordinary
measures
to
accomplish
a
racial
balance
in
the
schools
of
the
districts.
we're
merely
suggesting
the
old
fashion
traditional
system
of
neighborhood
schools
of
geographic
zoning
be
followed
here
as
if
no
doubt
would
have
been
followed
except
for
the
effort
to
escape
the
racial
integration
that
would
follow
from
such
geographic
zoning.
to
hear
the
respondent's
one
would
suppose
that
there
were
some
sort
of
constitutional
right
to
children
to
choose
their
own
schools.
there
is
of
course
no
such
right
and
that
fact
is
in
this
country
for
a
century
has
been
to
resign
the
children
to
the
school
even
there
is
their
home
or
on
some
other
basis
but
without
giving
them
any
absolute
freedom
as
to
which
school
they
wish
to
pick.
one
would
suppose
that
the
brown
decision
had
condemned
not
racial
segregation
but
compulsory
assignment.
shortly,
brown
did
not
condemn
the
old
system
of
assigning
children
to
a
school
in
the
best
interest
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
all
it
condemned
was
the
system
of
racial
assignments,
not
the
system
with
compulsory
assignments.
now,
it's
one
thing
and
bad
enough
if
the
school
districts
after
these
many
years
in
maintaining
segregation,
want
to
wash
their
hands
at
the
problem
and
leave
it
up
to
the
students
or
leave
it
up
with
somebody
else
to
repair
the
damage
that
have
been
done.
but
that's
not
even
to
this
case.
they're
not
simply
washing
their
hand
at
the
problem.
they're
not
simply
advocating
responsibility
which
it
seems
to
us
is
theirs
under
the
circumstances
and
in
light
of
the
history.
they're
going
--
taking
affirmative
steps.
they're
going
very
far
out
of
their
way
to
create,
to
make
it
possible
of
resegregation
or
a
perpetuation
of
segregation
within
the
school
districts.
they're
not
simply
letting
the
assignments
fall
as
they
would
naturally
by
geographic
zoning.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
seems
to
us,
mr.
justice
white,
presents
a
quite
different
problem.
i
don't
say
that
we
wouldn't
in
that
case
argue
that
at
least
against
the
background
of
enforced
racial
segregation.
there
weren't
some
offended
duty
on
the
school
board
to
take
measures
or
at
least
to
avoid
as
between
equal
alternatives.
that
alternative
which
is
least
likely
to
produce
an
end
of
the
new
school
system
but
that
is
not
what's
involved
here
as
i
say.
rather
these
school
boards
have
taken
quite
extraordinary
measures
to
avoid
the
natural
result
that
would
follow.
we
condemn
freedom
of
choice
here
in
this
context
where
it
does
seem
to
us
to
be
an
artificial
device
to
delay,
to
retard,
even
to
defeat
the
segregation.
first,
because
it's
so
obviously
artificial,
it
is
not
a
traditional
method
of
assigning,
at
least
in
the
south
of
assigning
elementary
and
high
school
students,
whatever
it
may
be,
college
area.
it
does
seem
to
be
educational
nonsense.
it's
a
pure
haphazard
system
in
theory
which
takes
no
account
of
what
things
they
might
be
desirable
from
educational
point
of
view.
at
least
in
those
cases
where
it
requires
long
distance
bussing
as
in
new
kent,
virginia
and
in
gould,
arkansas.
it
imposes
a
special
financial
burden
on
the
school
district
and
of
course,
it's
an
administrative
nightmare
if
it
works
as
it
should
in
theory
because
not
only
do
you
have
forms,
letters
to
be
sent
out,
receive,
tabulate,
count,
all
of
which
would
be
unnecessary.
if
the
school
board
to
simply
assign
as
it
used
to
on
the
basis
of
residence,
but
the
results
are
unpredictable
from
year
to
year.
school
construction
can't
proceed
on
any
intelligent
basis
if,
as
i
say,
it
worked
as
it's
supposed
to
in
theory
and
the
results
were
truly
unpredictable.
of
course,
the
fact
is
that
freedom
of
choice
is
not
supposed
to
work
toward
the
segregation.
if
it
did,
it
would
be
self-defeating
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
office
because
pretty
soon,
the
white
school
to
which
all
the
negroes
would
transfer
would
become
overcrowded.
the
negro
school
would
have
to
be
closed,
and
the
whole
theory
of
freedom
of
choice
would
be
ended
and
there
would
be
no
free
assignment
or
free
choice.
they
would
then
have
to
be
compulsory
assignments
on
the
basis
of
proximity
to
school.
this
fact
alone
shows
that
freedom
of
choice
is
not
supposed
to
work
in
the
sense
of
achieving
desegregation.
it
is
calculated
on
the
theory
that
the
whites
will
all
choose
to
attend
the
white
schools
and
that
very
few
negroes
will
overcome
the
burden
and
have
the
courage
to
take
the
adventure
into
a
school
where
they
have
been
shunned,
where
they
don't
expect
to
be
welcomed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
of
these
--
in
one
of
these
cases,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
figures
are
from
80%
to
85%
who
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
did
accomplish
that
much.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
are
not
playing
a
game
of
statistics
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
it
is
relevant
to
what
results
are
achieved.
if
good
results
are
achieved
the
method
even
though
seemingly
bad
is
harmless.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
results
are
so
insubstantial
as
they
are
here,
then
one
begins
to
look
to
see
if
some
other
method
would
not
achieve
better
results.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
figure
alone
will
not
find
meaningless,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
have
to
test
it
against
what
the
result
would
be
if
another
alternative
were
followed
especially
when
the
other
alternative
is
cheaper,
simpler,
more
customary
and
when
i
find
that
that
other
alternative
reproduced
50%
integration,
then
i've
condemned
the
20%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
the
gould
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
raney
as
the
gould
case
number
805,
gould,
arkansas,
either
of
the
two
methods
already
mentioned,
one
would
be
drawing
a
geographical
line
down
in
the
middle
as
mr.
justice
marshall
put
it
four
blocks
from
each
of
the
schools
right
down
the
middle
of
separating
this
district
into
two
zones
and
assigning
of
the
students
on
the
basis
of
geography
or
alternatively
qince
this
is
a
system
with
so
few
students,
one
would
suppose
that
economic
and
educational
considerations
would
normally
leave
the
school
district
if
race
were
not
involved
to
consolidate
or
pay
and
have
one
of
the
buildings
used
for
the
high
school
and
the
other
use
for
the
elementary
school
for
every
one
in
the
district.
that
latter
system,
of
course,
would
produce
total
desegregation
and
we
are
told
that
there's
a
little
residential
segregation
within
this
district
so
we
can
presume
that
a
fairly
drawn
geographic
zoning
system
would
likewise
produce
the
substantial
degree
of
this
occasion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
even
that
far
mr.
justice
fortas
because
here,
it's
not,
these
are
not
equal
alternatives.
this
is
so
obviously
a
cumbersome
out
of
the
way
transparent
device
to
drift
on
desegregation
that
they
don't
have
to
say
what
would
be
the
result
if
it
was
a
question
of
consolidation
versus
geographic
zoning
and
condemn
one
of
the
other
depending
on
resulting
statistics.
here,
there
is
an
extraordinary
effort
by
the
state
action
not
only
to
advocate
whatever
responsibility
they
may
be
in
the
school
district
to
repair,
to
compensate
for
the
discrimination
of
repairs
but
a
devising
of
a
scheme
which
allows
race
to
control
assignment
of
students.
albeit,
race
in
terms
of
the
exercise
of
private
prejudice
rather
than
the
school
board
itself
during
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
in
each
case
--
so
80%
to
85%
of
the
negroes
go
to
schools
in
which
they
are
the
white
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
submit,
there
maybe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
integrated
in
a
token
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
let
me
point
out
that
this
free
choice
which
is
spoken
of
as
though
we
were
asking
that
the
negroes
and
the
whites
be
denied.
it
seems
unfair
--
no
one
has
ever
asked
the
negroes
in
these
negro
schools
whether
they
would
object
to
the
assignment
of
the
white
students
there
until
that
point
comes,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
they
had
been
--
they
would
be
denied
the
right
to
go
to
school
alone.
there
are
of
course
obvious
in
many
reasons
why
the
negro
is
reluctant
to
take
the
advantage
into
the
white
school
and
the
system
works
so
as
to
put
the
entire
burden
on
here.
the
white
assigns
himself
back
to
his
old
school
where
he
is
familiar.
the
negro
is
expected
to
leave
the
familiar
surroundings
and
to
go
to
a
school
where
he
is
led
to
believe
right
or
wrong
that
he
will
be
shown
--
that
he
will
be
unwelcome
and
at
all
events,
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
a
move.
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
break
with
the
comfortable
customary
surrounding
and
that
in
itself
is
unfair.
all
these
would
be
tolerable
if
it
were
necessary,
if
it
were
unavoidable
but
it's
not
only
unnecessary
unavoidable,
it's
a
manufactured
burden
that
could
so
easily
by
employing
traditional
and
customary
method
of
assignment
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
to
say
first
mr.
justice
white
that
that
frightening
prospect
which
is
always
put
forward
in
these
cases,
tends
to
argue
against
any
desegregation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
have
no
basis
on
which
to
dispute
whether
in
this
particular
school
district
it
would
or
would
not
happen.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
it
were
irrelevant
even
if
it
works.
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
more
school
district
is
subjected
to
the
same
constitutional
standard,
the
less
place
there
is
to
flee
to.
the
more
tuition
aide
to
so-called
private
schools
are
stricken
down,
the
less
attractive
the
alternative
private
schooling
becomes
and
it
works
perhaps
a
little
bit
like
the
public
accommodation
law
of
--
if
everybody
has
to
desegregate
and
there's
no
place
else
to
go.
pretty
soon,
people
stay
where
they
once
were
and
i
would
hope
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
as
to
the
first,
it
is
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
there
is
no
basis
on
which
--
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
a
remand
to
reconsider
the
propriety
of
freedom
of
choice
in
those
two
districts
nor
of
the
free
transfer
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
what
as
to
wait
what
--
what
final
solution
ought
to
be
adopted
whether
geographic
zoning
or
pairing
a
consolidation
as
to
that
matter,
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
the
first
instance
a
matter
for
the
district
court
or
perhaps
the
school
board
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
think
this
court
should
condemn
freedom
of
choice
as
an
alternative
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
but
those
two.
i
don't
know
that
it
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
all
those
two
that
is
pairing
and
geographic
zoning.
i
would
not
suppose
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
choose
between
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
leave
it
perhaps
a
bit
more
open
and
if
the
district
court
could
device
some
plan
which
i
haven't
thought
of
which
might
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
suggest
that
this
court
ought
to
prescribe
the
précised
plan
which
any
given
district
ought
to
apply.
i
do
think
it
is
both
appropriate
that
fitting
that
this
court
do
condemn
freedom
of
choice
as
applied
in
this
sort
of
circumstance.
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
we
do
not
challenge
freedom
of
choice
in
all
circumstances
as
i
think
mr.
greenberg
mentioned
in
those
situations
where
residential
patterns
of
segregation
are
so
strict
that
geographic
zoning
would
produce
a
high
degree
of
segregation
of
--
freedom
of
choice
can
certainly
do
no
harm
and
it
may
do
substantial
good.
now
finally,
i
want
to
stress
that
because
this
is
such
a
transparent
device
to
unable
the
white
students
primarily
and
their
parents
to
segregate
or
continue
desegregation
of
the
school
system
in
a
way
that
the
state
itself
could
not.
because
everybody
understands
that
that's
the
reason
why
this
plan
was
resorted
to
and
because
that
message
has
been
gone
across
both
to
the
negro
community
and
the
white
community.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
appears
at
least
to
be
applauding,
to
be
encouraging,
to
be
at
least
sanctioning
and
approving
a
choice
made
on
the
basis
of
place.
since
this
is
a
device
to
permit
the
white
students
to
find
themselves
a
haven
away
from
their
normal
assignment
in
a
school
which
is
mostly
negro
and
since
the
state
has
gone
to
such
extraordinary
lands
and
put
such
a
burden
on
itself
to
make
this
choice
available,
it
has
thereby
indicated
to
all
members
of
the
community
that
this
is
a
legitimate
and
proper
basis
on
which
to
choose
your
school
and
thereby
it
seems
to
me
it
has
hardened
those
racials
--
racial
attitudes
which
is
our
purpose
of
educational
desegregation
to
relax
and
it
has
also
compounded
the
injury
on
the
negro
children.
it's
bad
enough
to
be
segregated
off
to
have
that
as
the
accidental
consequence
of
geographic
zoning
which
is
wholly
neutral
is
one
thing
but
to
have
it
as
the
consequence
of
a
deliberate
policy
sanctioned
by
the
state
being
shunned
by
the
white
students
who
live
next
door
to
them
and
makes
the
injury
that
much
more
severe.
that
is
the
injury
which
the
brown
decision
is
concerned
about,
that
injury
which
is
that
much
worse
when
it
seems
to
have
the
sanction,
the
approval
state
behind
it.
now
finally
and
to
conclude,
let
me
repeat
what
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
in
these
cases
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
the
school
board
had
an
affirmative
obligation
to
take
special
measures
to
achieve
racial
balance.
that
is
not
our
argument
here.
our
argument
is
rather
that
the
state
must
at
least
avoid
resorting
to
extraordinary
measures
which
can
only
be
in
their
purpose
and
effect
defeat
or
retard
desegregation.
on
this
submission,
we
suggest
that
in
all
the
three
cases,
the
judgments
below
be
reversed.
