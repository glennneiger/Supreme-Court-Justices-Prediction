do
you
have
a
school
bus
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
an
area
is
the
school
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
square
miles,
say,
from
what
--
suppose
it's
in
a
form
of
a
rectangle,
is
it,
or
a
square?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
you
tell
me
how
--
what
the
distance
is
between
the
two
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
eight
to
ten
blocks
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
those
two
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
unbelievable.
that
being
the
situation
mr.
light,
isn't
it?
isn't
the
fact
that
the
school
board
in
doing
here
what
it
has
done
is
merely
bowing
to
the
imperatives
of
community
feeling
rather
than
to
bow
to
the
law
in
trying
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
that
if
permitted
to
go
on,
it
will
go
on
indefinitely
that
all
the
white
students
will
go
to
one
school
or
practically
all
and
practically
all
the
negro's
go
to
another
and
the
desegregation
decisions
therefore
become
frustrated
entirely.
chief

yes.

chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
from
the
california
case,
the
act
simply
said
that
everyone
could
lease
or
sell
or
not
lease
or
not
sell
to
anyone
of
his
choice
for
any
reason.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
assuming
of
course
that
there
are
no
subtleties
in
the
situation
or
no
community
attitudes
or
anything
of
that
kind
that
would
deter
a
person
from
having
a
free
choice.
