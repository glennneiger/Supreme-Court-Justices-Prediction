mr.
russell
rice
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
be
very
brief.
on
page
14
of
our
brief
of
the
respondent,
the
relief
sought
in
the
lower
court
is
copied
therein
and
it
was
to
the
--
to
have
the
city
of
jackson
stop
excluding
these
plaintiffs
from
entering
the
jackson
high
school,
elementary
--
alexander
elementary
and
other
similar
schools
and
that
is
the
summary
judgment
that
was
granted
by
the
district
court
to
stop
excluding
these
people
form
these
schools
and
we
have
done
that.
now,
there
are
two
points
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general
that
provoked
me
to
make
a
short
rebuttal.
the
--
the
argument
that
i'm
starting
to
make
listening
carefully
that
racial
mixing
is
required
in
the
schools.
he
concluded
the
statement
by
saying
that
was
not
he
meant
and
he
said
that
freedom
of
choice
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se,
provided
the
freedom
--
provided
that
choice
is
exercised
in
a
predetermined
way.
in
other
words,
if
these
people
exercise
their
choice
in
accordance
with
the
plan
which
the
government
has
in
mind
for
them,
that
that
is
alright.
if
they
do
not
so
exercise
it
in
that
direction
then
it's
unconstitutional.
well
now,
that
is
no
freedom
whatever.
we
have
given
to
these
people,
to
these
parents
i
expect
this
more
reasonable.
we
have
given
to
the
parents,
the
right
to
determine
under
our
transfer
plan
to
where
that
child
will
go
to
school.
now,
in
this
court,
we
seek
to
take
that
right
away
from
that
parent
who
is
only
here
as
a
class.
it
--
i
think
it's
alright
to
bring
them
here
as
a
class
when
you're
trying
to
give
them
rights
but
now
we
seek
that
right
away
from
these
parents
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
government
that
the
parent
has
the
right
of
control
of
the
rearing
of
his
child.
so
now
we
will
take
that
away
from
that
parent
who
is
not
even
in
this
court
except
perhaps
as
a
member
of
a
class.
we
think
that
is
carrying
the
class
doctrine
too
far
and
finally,
i
want
to
make
this
point
that
there
has
been
in
many
cases,
some
effort
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
de
jure
segregation
and
de
facto
segregation
and
i've
heard
it
argued
here
today
that
segregation
which
results
from
housing
patterns.
well
now,
that's
alright
but
now
if
it's
something
that
occurred
in
the
state
that
had
a
statute
requiring
segregation
at
the
time
of
brown
then
it's
up
to
the
school
board
to
do
something
more
than
just
eliminate
that
segregation.
now,
i
want
to
ask
this
court
one
question.
if
you
are
in
a
de
facto
segregated
area
in
say
new
york
city
just
to
pick
an
example,
how
can
you
get
out?
you
are
there
by
law.
you
have
no
choice.
you
must
go
to
a
segregated
school
and
that's
alright
so
they
say.
in
the
city
of
jackson,
tennessee,
if
you
are
in
a
segregated
school,
you
get
out
by
signing
your
name
and
i
ask
the
court
which
really
gives
to
the
individual
the
greatest
choice.
i
thank
you.

russell
