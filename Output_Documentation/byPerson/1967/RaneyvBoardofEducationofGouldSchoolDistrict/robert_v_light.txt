mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
greenberg's
view
on
freedom
of
choice
had
change
since
1959.
during
which
year,
he
published
his
now
classic
book,
race
relations
and
american
law
that's
cited
in
our
brief
and
where
at
page
239,
he
stated,
“moreover,
the
jury
discrimination
precedence
may
be
recalled.
bias
may
be
presumed
from
a
consistently
segregated
result.
a
token
number
of
negroes
may
be
legally
equivalent
to
none.
if,
however,
in
education
there
were
complete
freedom
of
choice
or
geographical
zoning
or
any
other
non-racial
standard,
and
all
negroes
still
ended
up
in
certain
schools,
there
would
seem
to
be
no
constitutional
objection.”
and
i
endorse
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
embrace
that
principle
entirely.
he
was
entirely
right
when
he
wrote
those
words.
due
to
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
issues
here,
i
want
to
allude
only
very
briefly
to
the
factual
issues
that
are
peculiar
to
this
case,
that
are
not
involved
or
are
different
from
those
involved
in
the
other
cases.
with
respect
to
the
teacher
salary
differential,
and
it
must
be
remembered
this
case
was
tried
in
1965,
the
proof
was
that
there
was
a
small
differential
in
the
salary
paid
to
the
negro
and
white
teachers
that
the
school
board
had
an
active
program
for
several
years
prior
to
trial
narrowing
that
gap,
and
we're
using
all
of
the
financial
resources
of
the
district
to
do
it
and
it
was
comprehended
that
this
was
the
last
year
the
gap
would
exist.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
i
haven't
had
occasion
to
confirm
it
because
it
hadn't
dawned
on
me
until
i
heard
it
mentioned
in
the
argument
this
morning.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
immediate
year
after
trial,
that
gap
certainly
was
closed.
those
certainly
were
the
plans
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
commitment
made
to
the
district
judge,
and
he
made
that
observation
in
his
opinion.
with
respect
to
the
equality
of
the
facilities,
the
only
facility
which
could
be
said
to
be
unequal
that
was
set
aside
or
was
--
had
in
fact
been
used
historically
by
the
negro
students
is
the
negro
high
school.
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
plans
were
already
made
to
replace
that
facility.
it
was
an
old
building
and
it
needed
to
be
replaced.
and
funds
had
already
been
earmarked
to
replace
the
building.
it
has
now
been
replaced
and
the
campus
occupied
by
the
elementary
school
and
the
high
school
utilized
by
the
negro
students
in
this
district,
the
proof
will
show
in
this
record
is
far
superior
to
the
facility
used
by
the
black
students
because
of
the
addition
of
this
new
building.
the
elementary
school
that
had
been
attended
solely
by
negroes
was
already
a
relatively
new
and
perfectly
acceptable,
perfectly
useable
educational
facility.
with
respect
to
the
accreditation,
the
difference
between
the
two,
again,
this
was
three
years
ago
and
the
primary
reason
that
the
accreditation
at
the
school
attended
by
negroes
was
not
the
same
as
that
attended
by
whites
just
because
of
this
old
high
school
building
that
had
to
be
replaced
before
proper
accreditation
could
be
obtained.
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
in
the
briefs
and
the
very
brief
reference
by
mr.
greenberg,
to
some
intimidation
or
suggestion
of
intimidation
in
this
school
district
of
negro
students
attempting
or
undertaking
to
exercise
their
rights
under
the
constitution
and
their
rights
under
this
freedom
of
choice
plan,
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
get
into
the
detail
of
that
but
it
is
covered
in
detail
in
the
briefs.
there's
absolutely,
your
honors,
nothing
to
it.
i
will
rely
on
the
expressed
findings
of
both
of
the
courts
below
that
this
school
board
was
in
perfect
good
faith
in
adopting
and
carrying
you
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
and
undertaken
to
secure
the
rights
of
every
student
in
the
district,
whether
he'd
be
a
colored
child
or
a
white
child.
there
is
testimony
that
i
would
refer
the
court
to
on
that
subject
if
the
court
is
interested,
i
think
the
court
would
be,
in
the
attitude
of
the
board
of
directors
who
are
the
defendants
in
this
case
toward
the
exercise
by
the
negro
students
of
their
rights
and
toward
the
education
of
the
negro
students
just
like
their
interest
in
the
white
students,
and
that's
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
board.
and
his
testimony
when
asked,
was
--
is
there
any
intimidation
when
this
was
on
rebuttal?
is
there
any
intimidation
to
your
knowledge,
if
you
heard
anything
like
that
in
this
little
community?
and
of
course,
a
community
that
size,
the
president
and
the
school
board
are
going
to
know
it.
he
says,
“we've
had
nothing
like
that.
we've
gone
out.
the
board
members
have
gone
out
and
encouraged
these
negro
students
here
during
this
first
year
of
the
operation
of
the
plan
to
send
their
children
over
to
the
white
school.
we've
encouraged
them
to,”
he
said.
there's
not
a
member
of
this
board
that
doesn't
have
negro
people
living
on
their
property.
this
--
this
is
a
cotton-oriented
rural
community.
mr.
robert
v.
light
of
the
school
district?
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
the
town
is
the
only
incorporated
community
in
a
school
district.
a
school
district
is
rural
around
the
town,
but
i
don't
know
how
many
miles.
i
believe
there's
some
--
i'd
be
reluctant
to
tell
you
the
geographical
size.
the
population
of
the
school
district
is
about
3000
people,
i
believe
mr.
greenberg
said,
the
student
population.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
there
are
approximately
66
and
two-thirds
percent
negroes
in
the
school
population,
and
33
and
one-third
percent
white.
there
are
two
negro
students
for
each
white
student
in
this
district.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
your
honor.
no
white
child
or
his
parent
in
his
behalf
has
exercised
his
right
to
go
to
that
school.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
hadn't
previously
been
aware
that
the
figures
might
indicate
that
there
are
some
disproportionate
amounts
of
money
spent
on
the
gymnasium.
the
gymnasium
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
gymnasium,
i've
--
i've
been
in
that
facility
as
i
recall.
it
contains
various
facilities
other
than
the
gymnasium
itself.
that
building
is
just
--
it
was
referred
to
as
a
gymnasium
because
that's
the
predominant
leisure.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
your
honor,
not
in
this
case
because
that
--
the
field
elementary
and
high
school
complex,
which
is
on
the
same
campus
and
the
same
square
block
or
two
square
blocks
is
by
far
the
superior
physical
facility
in
that
district.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
because
they
have
a
free
right,
an
absolute
right
to
choose
to
go
to
the
field
school
or
to
the
gould
school,
just
like
--
without
regard
to
race.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
bus
transportation
is
afforded
to
students
that
live
beyond
a
certain
distance
from
the
school,
which
is
a
state-mandated
distance,
i
believe,
it's
two
miles.
and
the
busses
are
routed
to
serve
the
school
to
which
they're
assigned.
and
the
negro
students
who
have
selected
to
go
to
the
gould
school
ride
to
gould
school
busses.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
was
the
question
mr.
justice
black
just
asked
and
i
told
him
i'd
have
to
guess.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
my
recollection
is
that
we've
never
introduced
maps
in
this
litigation
of
this
district.
there've
been
--
been
no
occasion
to
really.
it's
--
it's
a
sizeable
little
country
school
district
with
the
entire
state
penitentiary
in
state
ingle
farm
enclosed
within
its
boundaries,
and
that
farm
is
20,000
acres.
now
that's
really
--
i
--
i
can't
give
you
anymore
accurate
description
without
going
back
to
the
record.
this
is
in
the
record,
i
believe,
the
suit
is
going
to
describe
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
eight
to
ten
blocks.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
they
are
both
in
the
little
community,
incorporated
community
of
gould.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
and
it
has
not
withdrawn
that
approval,
your
honor.
as
mr.
greenberg
said,
and
i
appreciate
his
candor,
it
was
only
a
one-year
incident
in
which
every
child
in
the
district
was
not
afforded
the
right
to
select
the
school.
the
two
subsequent
years,
including
this
current
school
year,
there
have
been
no
overcrowding
of
a
facility
and
every
child
in
that
school
district
is
attending
school
that
was
selected
by
him
or
by
his
parents
and
there
had
been
no
further
complaint
or
--
further
complaint
or
had
been
no
complaint
at
all
from
hew.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
my
recollection
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
this
documentation
was
introduced
in
the
record,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
printed
in
the
printed
appendix
however
and
i,
of
course,
had
little
to
do
with
that,
but
the
references
are
there.
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
putting
that
material
in
is
there.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
white,
i
really
don't
know
what
came
--
what
the
other
side
brought
up
in
a
way
of
a
record.
the
printed
appendix
that
was
all
served
on
me.
i'd
like
to
point
out
since
the
ballot
case
was
mentioned
by
mr.
greenberg
where
the
racial
designation
were
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
negro
or
white
that
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
that
was
the
state
making
racial
classifications,
and
what
we've
done
here
is
quit
making
racial
classifications.
we're
affording
the
fullest
exercise
of
individual
liberties
without
any
possibility
of
penalty
because
of
race.
mr.
robert
v.
light
they
--
between
themselves,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
they
do,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
and
if
they
do,
it
would
be
an
innovation
since
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
there
is
some
organized
athletic
activity.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
sort
of
program
they
play
on,
whether
they
are
large
enough
to
participate
in
a
formal
scheduled
program
or
not.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
subsequent
to
brown,
there
having
been
no
intimation
of
course
in
brown
that
the
constitution
compels
the
intermingling
of
the
races
by
any
sort
of
predetermined
mixture
that
what
the
people
had
to
do,
what
the
state
had
to
do
is
quit
discriminating,
quit
making
racial
classifications
in
public
education,
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeal
of
every
circuit
that
had
substantial
school
desegregation
litigation
were
unanimous
in
reading
brown
just
as
judge
parker
did
that
the
constitution
doesn't
commend
integration
and
the
spring
board
hadn't
held
that
it
does
until
the
jackson
county
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
last
year
or
14
months
ago.
and
with
all
respect
of
course
to
that
court,
that
decision
is
just
wrong
and
its
error
can
be
demonstrated
by
looking
at
why
judge
wisdom
says
we've
got
to
take
a
new
look
at
this
constitutional
question
because
that
court
was
having
to
overrule
some
50
of
its
own
earlier
decisions
on
this
very
court.
he
says
what
makes
us
take
a
different
look
at
it
now
is
the
civil
right
act
of
1964
has
been
passed
and
it
goes
on
to
mention
that
the
hew
has
promulgated
some
guidelines
on
how
to
go
about
school
desegregation.
and
then,
they
examined
the
constitutional
issues
in
light
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
concluded
that
it
required
the
affirmative
manipulation
of
the
students
in
order
to
achieve
affirmative
integration.
and
of
course,
the
act
didn't
do
anything
of
this
sort,
your
honors.
its
own
language
is
crystal
clear
and
its
legislative
history
is
entirely
consistent
that
the
intent
was
to
adopt
the
legal
duty
as
the
legal
duty
of
local
school
officials
in
this
area,
that
which
was
already
their
duty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
construed
by
this
court
in
brown,
and
there
are
expressed
references.
senator
humphrey
who
managed
the
bill
on
the
senate
expressly
said
here's
the
bell
against
school
city
case
decided
by
judge
beamer
later
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
i
believe
it
is,
and
certiorari
denied
here.
this
is
the
sense
of
congress.
this
is
the
national
policy
that
we're
adopting
that
if
the
constitution
doesn't
require
manipulation
of
these
people,
it
doesn't
require
overcoming
racial
imbalances,
what
it
requires
is
that
you
do
not
discriminate,
you
do
not
classify
these
people
according
to
race
with
respect
to
admitting
and
assigning
them
to
the
public
schools.
and
in
the
even
that
congress
left
anything
to
be
speculative
about
what
its
intent
was
in
the
'64
act,
in
1966
it
came
along
and
made
it
expressly
clear
in
the
1966
amendments
to
the
1965
secondary
and
--
elementary
and
secondary
aid
to
education
act.
and
at
page
42
on
our
brief,
we
set
out
this
amendment
which
states
that
in
the
administration
of
this
chapter,
no
department,
agency,
officer,
employees
of
united
states
shall
exercise
any
direction,
supervision
or
control
over
the
personnel,
curriculum
or
program
of
instruction
of
any
school
or
school
system
and
any
local
or
state
educational
agency
are
--
now,
this
is
the
language
that
was
added
by
the
1966
amendment
that
i'm
about
to
read,
are
required
the
assignment
or
transportation
of
students
or
teachers
in
order
to
overcome
racial
imbalance.
that's
the
national
policy
expressed
by
the
congress
with
respect
to
any
federal
concern
about
racial
imbalances.
i'd
like
to
say
this
of
freedom
of
choice
and
since
it's
suggested
that
it
was
a
recent
innovation
to
escape
constitutional
obligation,
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
what
my
adversary
suggests.
in
the
first
place,
it's
a
method
of
school
assignment
that
had
been
followed
by
many
districts.
it
happens
to
be
that
the
residential
zoning,
drawing
zoning
lines
has
been
the
predominant
wave
of
assigning
students
to
school
on
its
country.
but
i
think
freedom
of
choice
is
next.
baltimore
is
the
largest
city
that's
traditionally
for
many,
many
years
used
freedom
of
choice,
and
that
was
apparent.
i
leaned
that
in
re-reading
the
arguments
before
this
court
in
the
brown
case.
for
many
years
prior
to
that,
baltimore
used
freedom
of
choice.
many
other
places
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
perhaps
the
first
references
that
i
read,
and
i
don't
recall,
concerning
the
baltimore
freedom
of
choice
plan
because
it
was
discussed
by
several
of
the
counsel.
and
i
think
on
both
sides
of
the
table
during
the
brown
arguments
may
have
been
during
the
last
argument
concerning
the
remedy.
but
references
were
made,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
don't
know
whether
we
had
it
in
arkansas,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
we
didn't
have
it
in
gould,
your
honor.
we
didn't.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
we've
got
it
1965.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
combine
facilities
that
are
eight
to
ten
blocks
apart
physically.
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
that's
one
of
the
“feasible
alternatives”
suggested
by
our
adversaries.
mr.
robert
v.
light
with
gould?
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
proof
in
the
trial
that
was
there
is
no
space
available
on
the
gould
campus
for
any
further
construction
because
the
issue
tried
in
this
case
below,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
whether
we
should
build
this
new
proposed
high
school
building
on
the
site
that
the
school
board
had
secured
and
was
planning
on
building
on,
which
was
near
the
field
elementary
school,
or
whether
we
should
build
one
in
gould.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
certainly
the
proof
in
the
record
doesn't
support
that
assumption.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
would
certainly
concede
it's
a
possibility.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
what
really
was
a
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
suppose
that's
a
possibility.
of
course,
it's
--
as
your
honor
knows
from
the
dispute
in
the
prior
case
when
you
get
into
drawing
lines,
people
disagree
on
whether
the
line
--
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
but
one
of
the
failings
of
that
is
that
it
wouldn't
offer
the
opportunity
we
do
here
for
every
child
or
his
parent
on
his
behalf
to
make
a
full
and
free
choice
on
his
own
in
this
matter.
mr.
robert
v.
light
this
board
that
i
represent
considered
both
of
the
schools
now
your
honor.
i
want
to
say
something
of
freedom
of
choice
that
it
is
not
what
it
might
be
pictured
here
just
to
device
to
achieve
a
result
that
it
maybe
thought
that
we
have
set
out
to
achieve.
it's
an
old
procedure
in
education
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
how
it
works
at
the
collegiate
level.
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
since
they
started
building
colleges
in
this
country
300
years
ago
and
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
ever
since
the
states
got
into
the
business
of
offering
collegiate
training
to
their
citizens
and
even
in
the
states
where
formally
segregation
was
legal,
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
since
some
years
before
brown
because
of
the
decision
to
this
court
in
sweatt
against
painter
and
mclaurin.
and
what
has
that
freedom
of
choice,
that
long
existing
freedom
of
choice
and
currently
freedom
of
choice
produced?
it's
produced
the
same
pattern
that
we've
got
in
this
school
district
with
respect
to
racial
attendance
and
the
same
pattern
you
have
in
the
virginia's
case,
the
school
district
with
respect
the
racial
pattern.
you
have
a
relatively
few
negro
students
going
to
white
educational,
predominantly
white
educational
institution.
and
the
gould
school
district
is
possibly
15%
of
the
negro
students
have
elected
the
old
to
the
previously
white
school
in
the
new
kent
county,
virginia,
i
believe
it's
about
18%.
that's
about
the
pattern
you
have
in
the
colleges
over
this
nation
as
the
result
of
freedom
of
choice.
the
vast
majority
of
these
people
and
the
court
can't
go
any
other
rational
inference,
i
don't
think
want
to
attend
school
with
members
of
their
own
race
and
that's
been
proved
year
after
year.
i've
never
heard
any
suggestion
that
any
intimidation
brought
about
that
pattern.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
there
would
be
a
serious
question.
i
believe
the
vast
majority
of
the
negro
students
in
this
nation
who
are
receiving
collegiate
training
are
in
predominantly
are
all
negro
schools
and
if
the
court
should
make
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
it's
unlawful
to
operate
an
all
negro
educational
institution
as
i
understand
the
petitioner
seek
to
have
invoked
here.
but
what
will
happen
to
all
of
those
negro
colleges
where
collegiate
training
is
now
being
received?
it's
a
serious
problem.
i
want
to
bring
down
realistically
in
concrete
fact
that
way
from
the
theories,
what
would
happen
if
this
court
adopted
the
rule
of
law
that
the
petitioner
seek
here?
they
have
suggested
as
their
alternative
or
feasible
alternative
although
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
that
it
was
feasible.
well,
this
issue
wasn't
even
tried
in
the
district
court
that
we
could
make
one
of
the
schools,
an
elementary
school
and
one
a
high
school.
if
we
did
that
your
honors,
the
high
school
would
contain
157
white
students
and
100
--
correction
--
and
247
negro
students.
and
i
had
erroneously
given
that
that
would
be
the
elementary
school.
the
high
school
would
contain
147
white
students
and
301
negro
students.
these
are
based
on
the
figures
supplied
by
the
petitioners
with
their
petition
for
certiorari.
they
file
the
hew
statistics
concerning
this
district
with
this
court
and
i've
taken
those
figures.
so
you've
got
approximately
two
negro
students
and
one
white
student
in
each
of
those
schools
and
i
think
that
if
we
examine
that
situation
with
candor
and
the
time
i
believe
has
come
for
candor
and
i
want
to
speak
to
the
court
with
candor
on
this
that
we
know
from
experience
that
the
white
students
will
not
continue
to
attend
those
schools.
that's
the
racial
breakdown
you'd
have
if
the
white
students
stayed
in
those
schools.
but
they
would
flee
just
as
inevitably
as
they
have
fled
from
the
public
schools
of
washington
dc
and
go
to
private
schools,
go
stay
with
relatives
in
some
other
school
district
but
they
leave
and
i
don't
know
how
to
characterize
the
reason
for
them
doing
that
any
better
than
to
say
in
all
sincerity
that
as
one
of
the
justices
suggested
this
morning,
i
believe
the
chief
justice,
that
we
can't
ignore
what's
going
on
for
a
hundred
years
in
that
community.
well,
we
can't
ignore
what's
going
on
for
a
hundred
years
in
that
community
and
whether
that
history
is
right
or
wrong,
whether
it's
more
with
christian
is
going
on.
it's
a
fact
that
we
have
to
deal
with
and
that
has
produced
two
groups
of
people
with
such
cultural
differences
in
that
community,
your
honor,
that
when
the
predominant
culture
becomes
that
of
the
negro
people
in
the
community,
the
white
people
flee
from
it.
it's
not
acceptable
term
and
to
say
this
that
difficult
thing
to
speak
with
--
to
speak
about
with
candor
but
i
feel
obliged
to
speak
about
it
with
candor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
oh,
no
sir.
your
honor,
to
answer
the
first
of
your
two
part
question.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
motive
of
the
school
board
and
this
has
been
inquired
about
before
doing
the
course
of
these
arguments.
if
the
motive
of
the
school
board
is
impertinent,
perhaps
it
is
if
adopted
this
alternative
from
among
the
several
that
it
had
to
look
at,
at
the
time
that
procedure
desegregate
these
schools
because
it's
the
only
one
it
could
adopt
in
its
judgment
not
concurring
its
judgment
that
wouldn't
destroy
the
public
schools
of
this
system.
it's
the
only
one
that
would
be
constitutional
that
it
gave
everybody
their
rights.
the
full
equality
of
the
law
and
yet
not
destroy
the
public
school
system
by
driving
out
a
substantial
segment
of
the
community
and
losing
the
support
for
the
public
schools
that
that
segment
of
the
community
provides.
i
--
i'm
fearful.
mr.
robert
v.
light
in
--
in
that
county?
mr.
robert
v.
light
none
of
which
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
presume
that
there
are
no
private
schools
and
in
fact,
i'm
relatively
certain
from
my
reading
that
there
are
no
private
schools
in
prince
edward
county,
virginia
until
the
recent
years.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
these
respondents
your
honor
will
comply
to
the
extent
within
their
power
with
whatever
order
of
this
court
enter.
i'm
concerned
about
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i'm
not
clairvoyant
not
to
project
that
but
i
imagine
that
it
would
largely
coincide
with
the
length
of
time
it
took
the
majority
of
the
negro
people
in
that
community
to
decide
that
they
didn't
want
to
keep
their
own
school
and
use
it
as
their
community
center
and
attend
school
with
members
of
their
own
race.
every
one
of
them
mr.
justice
marshall
has
this
right
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
arthur
lee
raney
is
in
the
gould
school
and
admitted
to
the
school
when
he
first
applied
in
1965
and
was
erroneously
listed
his
plane
fair.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i'm
speaking
for
all
the
negro's
in
saying
what
sir?
mr.
robert
v.
light
i'm
speaking
of
all
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
i'm
speaking
of
all
that
are
in
the
field
of
high
school
and
elementary
school
in
this
school
district
because
they've
had
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
it
goes
out
that
i
have
some
professional
contact
with
some
of
the
staff.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
why
i'm
not
speaking
furthermore
thinking
of
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
and
i
thought
i'd
selected
the
word
of,
i
meant
to
because
i'm
sensitive
to
mr.
greenberg
taking
the
position
that
he
speaks
for
all
negro's
when
i
know
that
he
does
not
and
cannot
be
impossible.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
i
respectfully
suggest
that
you've
taken
some
liberty
with
what
i
said.
i
--
i
have
said
that
the
negroes
in
the
field
school
complex,
all
freely
selected
to
go
there.
they're
there
because
they
want
to
be
there.
now
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
but
i
know
how
the
mechanics
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
they
filled
out
a
child's
form
to
get
there.
they
selected
the
school
and
now
those
that
are
in
the
higher
grade
before
1965,
originally
were
assigned
there
on
a
racial
basis.
mr.
robert
v.
light
how
do
they
get
out?
by
signing
a
document
such
as
the
one
that
mr.
greenberg
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
the
parents
in
some
instances,
the
child
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
--
that's
right,
simply
signing
in
there,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
claiborne
indicated
that
he
would
not
challenge
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
whites
to
flee
when
a
predominantly
negro
facility
develops.
i
have
evidence
to
support
that
in
the
form
of
the
report
of
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
cited
at
page
60
of
my
brief
where
they
say
there's
evidence
to
suggest
that
once
a
school
becomes
almost
half
or
majority
negro,
it
tends
rapidly
to
become
nearly
all
negro
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
experience
in
life
that
we've
had
all
over
the
country.
this
isn't
a
sudden
phenomenon.
i
do
not
want
to
be
understood
as
arguing
that
the
court
should
approve
the
freedom
of
choice
method
of
school
assignment
because
it's
the
only
one
that
will
preserve
the
public
schools
in
the
rural
south
at
least
that
it
is.
the
court
should
approve
it
because
it's
clearly
constitutional
where
it
accords
to
every
one
the
full
exercise
of
these
constitutional
rights.
and
incidentally,
it
will
preserve
the
public
schools.
i
think
that
it's
interesting
that
in
the
three
hours
of
argument
we've
been
talking
about
schools
and
we've
been
talking
about
desegregation
that
nothing
had
been
said
really
about
education
and
how
does
it
square
with
this
and
after
all
the
purpose
of
the
schools
is
to
educate
these
children
and
i
believe
that
the
voice
of
an
educator
should
be
before
the
court.
in
the
tennessee
case,
there's
a
large
appendix
of
many
writings
to
assist
the
court
in
determining
what
the
practical
things
would
be
if
you
strike
down
the
freedom
of
choice
here.
what
would
be
the
practical
effects
if
we're
required
to
adopt
the
plan
that
will
put
in
gould
school
district,
66
negro
students
and
33
white
students,
a
ratio
of
that
sort?
will
that
affect
the
education?
will
the
placement
of
two
hostile
groups
in
the
same
building
perpetuate
a
climate
where
education
can
take
place?
i
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
no.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
couldn't
attest
to
it
or
challenge
it.
i
have
not
made
those
observations
of
white
children
playing
together
so
i'm
not
in
position.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
have
not
but
my
occasion
to
be
in
gould
which
is
some
70
miles
perhaps
from
little
rock
would
not
be
frequent
enough
to
make
me
a
reliable
observer.
mr.
robert
v.
light
white
and
negro
children
playing
in
little
rock?
mr.
robert
v.
light
on
the
school
grounds
of
our
desegregated
schools
that's
a
common
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i'm
not
a
psychiatrist
or
a
sociologist.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
greenberg's
view
on
freedom
of
choice
had
change
since
1959.
during
which
year,
he
published
his
now
classic
book,
race
relations
and
american
law
that's
cited
in
our
brief
and
where
at
page
239,
he
stated,
“moreover,
the
jury
discrimination
precedence
may
be
recalled.
bias
may
be
presumed
from
a
consistently
segregated
result.
a
token
number
of
negroes
may
be
legally
equivalent
to
none.
if,
however,
in
education
there
were
complete
freedom
of
choice
or
geographical
zoning
or
any
other
non-racial
standard,
and
all
negroes
still
ended
up
in
certain
schools,
there
would
seem
to
be
no
constitutional
objection.”
and
i
endorse
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
embrace
that
principle
entirely.
he
was
entirely
right
when
he
wrote
those
words.
due
to
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
issues
here,
i
want
to
allude
only
very
briefly
to
the
factual
issues
that
are
peculiar
to
this
case,
that
are
not
involved
or
are
different
from
those
involved
in
the
other
cases.
with
respect
to
the
teacher
salary
differential,
and
it
must
be
remembered
this
case
was
tried
in
1965,
the
proof
was
that
there
was
a
small
differential
in
the
salary
paid
to
the
negro
and
white
teachers
that
the
school
board
had
an
active
program
for
several
years
prior
to
trial
narrowing
that
gap,
and
we're
using
all
of
the
financial
resources
of
the
district
to
do
it
and
it
was
comprehended
that
this
was
the
last
year
the
gap
would
exist.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
i
haven't
had
occasion
to
confirm
it
because
it
hadn't
dawned
on
me
until
i
heard
it
mentioned
in
the
argument
this
morning.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
immediate
year
after
trial,
that
gap
certainly
was
closed.
those
certainly
were
the
plans
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
commitment
made
to
the
district
judge,
and
he
made
that
observation
in
his
opinion.
with
respect
to
the
equality
of
the
facilities,
the
only
facility
which
could
be
said
to
be
unequal
that
was
set
aside
or
was
--
had
in
fact
been
used
historically
by
the
negro
students
is
the
negro
high
school.
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
plans
were
already
made
to
replace
that
facility.
it
was
an
old
building
and
it
needed
to
be
replaced.
and
funds
had
already
been
earmarked
to
replace
the
building.
it
has
now
been
replaced
and
the
campus
occupied
by
the
elementary
school
and
the
high
school
utilized
by
the
negro
students
in
this
district,
the
proof
will
show
in
this
record
is
far
superior
to
the
facility
used
by
the
black
students
because
of
the
addition
of
this
new
building.
the
elementary
school
that
had
been
attended
solely
by
negroes
was
already
a
relatively
new
and
perfectly
acceptable,
perfectly
useable
educational
facility.
with
respect
to
the
accreditation,
the
difference
between
the
two,
again,
this
was
three
years
ago
and
the
primary
reason
that
the
accreditation
at
the
school
attended
by
negroes
was
not
the
same
as
that
attended
by
whites
just
because
of
this
old
high
school
building
that
had
to
be
replaced
before
proper
accreditation
could
be
obtained.
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
in
the
briefs
and
the
very
brief
reference
by
mr.
greenberg,
to
some
intimidation
or
suggestion
of
intimidation
in
this
school
district
of
negro
students
attempting
or
undertaking
to
exercise
their
rights
under
the
constitution
and
their
rights
under
this
freedom
of
choice
plan,
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
get
into
the
detail
of
that
but
it
is
covered
in
detail
in
the
briefs.
there's
absolutely,
your
honors,
nothing
to
it.
i
will
rely
on
the
expressed
findings
of
both
of
the
courts
below
that
this
school
board
was
in
perfect
good
faith
in
adopting
and
carrying
you
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
and
undertaken
to
secure
the
rights
of
every
student
in
the
district,
whether
he'd
be
a
colored
child
or
a
white
child.
there
is
testimony
that
i
would
refer
the
court
to
on
that
subject
if
the
court
is
interested,
i
think
the
court
would
be,
in
the
attitude
of
the
board
of
directors
who
are
the
defendants
in
this
case
toward
the
exercise
by
the
negro
students
of
their
rights
and
toward
the
education
of
the
negro
students
just
like
their
interest
in
the
white
students,
and
that's
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
board.
and
his
testimony
when
asked,
was
--
is
there
any
intimidation
when
this
was
on
rebuttal?
is
there
any
intimidation
to
your
knowledge,
if
you
heard
anything
like
that
in
this
little
community?
and
of
course,
a
community
that
size,
the
president
and
the
school
board
are
going
to
know
it.
he
says,
“we've
had
nothing
like
that.
we've
gone
out.
the
board
members
have
gone
out
and
encouraged
these
negro
students
here
during
this
first
year
of
the
operation
of
the
plan
to
send
their
children
over
to
the
white
school.
we've
encouraged
them
to,”
he
said.
there's
not
a
member
of
this
board
that
doesn't
have
negro
people
living
on
their
property.
this
--
this
is
a
cotton-oriented
rural
community.
mr.
robert
v.
light
of
the
school
district?
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
the
town
is
the
only
incorporated
community
in
a
school
district.
a
school
district
is
rural
around
the
town,
but
i
don't
know
how
many
miles.
i
believe
there's
some
--
i'd
be
reluctant
to
tell
you
the
geographical
size.
the
population
of
the
school
district
is
about
3000
people,
i
believe
mr.
greenberg
said,
the
student
population.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
there
are
approximately
66
and
two-thirds
percent
negroes
in
the
school
population,
and
33
and
one-third
percent
white.
there
are
two
negro
students
for
each
white
student
in
this
district.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
your
honor.
no
white
child
or
his
parent
in
his
behalf
has
exercised
his
right
to
go
to
that
school.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
hadn't
previously
been
aware
that
the
figures
might
indicate
that
there
are
some
disproportionate
amounts
of
money
spent
on
the
gymnasium.
the
gymnasium
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
gymnasium,
i've
--
i've
been
in
that
facility
as
i
recall.
it
contains
various
facilities
other
than
the
gymnasium
itself.
that
building
is
just
--
it
was
referred
to
as
a
gymnasium
because
that's
the
predominant
leisure.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
your
honor,
not
in
this
case
because
that
--
the
field
elementary
and
high
school
complex,
which
is
on
the
same
campus
and
the
same
square
block
or
two
square
blocks
is
by
far
the
superior
physical
facility
in
that
district.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
because
they
have
a
free
right,
an
absolute
right
to
choose
to
go
to
the
field
school
or
to
the
gould
school,
just
like
--
without
regard
to
race.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
bus
transportation
is
afforded
to
students
that
live
beyond
a
certain
distance
from
the
school,
which
is
a
state-mandated
distance,
i
believe,
it's
two
miles.
and
the
busses
are
routed
to
serve
the
school
to
which
they're
assigned.
and
the
negro
students
who
have
selected
to
go
to
the
gould
school
ride
to
gould
school
busses.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
was
the
question
mr.
justice
black
just
asked
and
i
told
him
i'd
have
to
guess.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
my
recollection
is
that
we've
never
introduced
maps
in
this
litigation
of
this
district.
there've
been
--
been
no
occasion
to
really.
it's
--
it's
a
sizeable
little
country
school
district
with
the
entire
state
penitentiary
in
state
ingle
farm
enclosed
within
its
boundaries,
and
that
farm
is
20,000
acres.
now
that's
really
--
i
--
i
can't
give
you
anymore
accurate
description
without
going
back
to
the
record.
this
is
in
the
record,
i
believe,
the
suit
is
going
to
describe
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
eight
to
ten
blocks.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
they
are
both
in
the
little
community,
incorporated
community
of
gould.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
and
it
has
not
withdrawn
that
approval,
your
honor.
as
mr.
greenberg
said,
and
i
appreciate
his
candor,
it
was
only
a
one-year
incident
in
which
every
child
in
the
district
was
not
afforded
the
right
to
select
the
school.
the
two
subsequent
years,
including
this
current
school
year,
there
have
been
no
overcrowding
of
a
facility
and
every
child
in
that
school
district
is
attending
school
that
was
selected
by
him
or
by
his
parents
and
there
had
been
no
further
complaint
or
--
further
complaint
or
had
been
no
complaint
at
all
from
hew.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
my
recollection
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
this
documentation
was
introduced
in
the
record,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
printed
in
the
printed
appendix
however
and
i,
of
course,
had
little
to
do
with
that,
but
the
references
are
there.
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
putting
that
material
in
is
there.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
white,
i
really
don't
know
what
came
--
what
the
other
side
brought
up
in
a
way
of
a
record.
the
printed
appendix
that
was
all
served
on
me.
i'd
like
to
point
out
since
the
ballot
case
was
mentioned
by
mr.
greenberg
where
the
racial
designation
were
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
negro
or
white
that
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
that
was
the
state
making
racial
classifications,
and
what
we've
done
here
is
quit
making
racial
classifications.
we're
affording
the
fullest
exercise
of
individual
liberties
without
any
possibility
of
penalty
because
of
race.
mr.
robert
v.
light
they
--
between
themselves,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
they
do,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
and
if
they
do,
it
would
be
an
innovation
since
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
there
is
some
organized
athletic
activity.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
sort
of
program
they
play
on,
whether
they
are
large
enough
to
participate
in
a
formal
scheduled
program
or
not.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
subsequent
to
brown,
there
having
been
no
intimation
of
course
in
brown
that
the
constitution
compels
the
intermingling
of
the
races
by
any
sort
of
predetermined
mixture
that
what
the
people
had
to
do,
what
the
state
had
to
do
is
quit
discriminating,
quit
making
racial
classifications
in
public
education,
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeal
of
every
circuit
that
had
substantial
school
desegregation
litigation
were
unanimous
in
reading
brown
just
as
judge
parker
did
that
the
constitution
doesn't
commend
integration
and
the
spring
board
hadn't
held
that
it
does
until
the
jackson
county
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
last
year
or
14
months
ago.
and
with
all
respect
of
course
to
that
court,
that
decision
is
just
wrong
and
its
error
can
be
demonstrated
by
looking
at
why
judge
wisdom
says
we've
got
to
take
a
new
look
at
this
constitutional
question
because
that
court
was
having
to
overrule
some
50
of
its
own
earlier
decisions
on
this
very
court.
he
says
what
makes
us
take
a
different
look
at
it
now
is
the
civil
right
act
of
1964
has
been
passed
and
it
goes
on
to
mention
that
the
hew
has
promulgated
some
guidelines
on
how
to
go
about
school
desegregation.
and
then,
they
examined
the
constitutional
issues
in
light
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
concluded
that
it
required
the
affirmative
manipulation
of
the
students
in
order
to
achieve
affirmative
integration.
and
of
course,
the
act
didn't
do
anything
of
this
sort,
your
honors.
its
own
language
is
crystal
clear
and
its
legislative
history
is
entirely
consistent
that
the
intent
was
to
adopt
the
legal
duty
as
the
legal
duty
of
local
school
officials
in
this
area,
that
which
was
already
their
duty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
construed
by
this
court
in
brown,
and
there
are
expressed
references.
senator
humphrey
who
managed
the
bill
on
the
senate
expressly
said
here's
the
bell
against
school
city
case
decided
by
judge
beamer
later
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
i
believe
it
is,
and
certiorari
denied
here.
this
is
the
sense
of
congress.
this
is
the
national
policy
that
we're
adopting
that
if
the
constitution
doesn't
require
manipulation
of
these
people,
it
doesn't
require
overcoming
racial
imbalances,
what
it
requires
is
that
you
do
not
discriminate,
you
do
not
classify
these
people
according
to
race
with
respect
to
admitting
and
assigning
them
to
the
public
schools.
and
in
the
even
that
congress
left
anything
to
be
speculative
about
what
its
intent
was
in
the
'64
act,
in
1966
it
came
along
and
made
it
expressly
clear
in
the
1966
amendments
to
the
1965
secondary
and
--
elementary
and
secondary
aid
to
education
act.
and
at
page
42
on
our
brief,
we
set
out
this
amendment
which
states
that
in
the
administration
of
this
chapter,
no
department,
agency,
officer,
employees
of
united
states
shall
exercise
any
direction,
supervision
or
control
over
the
personnel,
curriculum
or
program
of
instruction
of
any
school
or
school
system
and
any
local
or
state
educational
agency
are
--
now,
this
is
the
language
that
was
added
by
the
1966
amendment
that
i'm
about
to
read,
are
required
the
assignment
or
transportation
of
students
or
teachers
in
order
to
overcome
racial
imbalance.
that's
the
national
policy
expressed
by
the
congress
with
respect
to
any
federal
concern
about
racial
imbalances.
i'd
like
to
say
this
of
freedom
of
choice
and
since
it's
suggested
that
it
was
a
recent
innovation
to
escape
constitutional
obligation,
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
what
my
adversary
suggests.
in
the
first
place,
it's
a
method
of
school
assignment
that
had
been
followed
by
many
districts.
it
happens
to
be
that
the
residential
zoning,
drawing
zoning
lines
has
been
the
predominant
wave
of
assigning
students
to
school
on
its
country.
but
i
think
freedom
of
choice
is
next.
baltimore
is
the
largest
city
that's
traditionally
for
many,
many
years
used
freedom
of
choice,
and
that
was
apparent.
i
leaned
that
in
re-reading
the
arguments
before
this
court
in
the
brown
case.
for
many
years
prior
to
that,
baltimore
used
freedom
of
choice.
many
other
places
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
perhaps
the
first
references
that
i
read,
and
i
don't
recall,
concerning
the
baltimore
freedom
of
choice
plan
because
it
was
discussed
by
several
of
the
counsel.
and
i
think
on
both
sides
of
the
table
during
the
brown
arguments
may
have
been
during
the
last
argument
concerning
the
remedy.
but
references
were
made,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
don't
know
whether
we
had
it
in
arkansas,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
we
didn't
have
it
in
gould,
your
honor.
we
didn't.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
we've
got
it
1965.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
combine
facilities
that
are
eight
to
ten
blocks
apart
physically.
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
that's
one
of
the
“feasible
alternatives”
suggested
by
our
adversaries.
mr.
robert
v.
light
with
gould?
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
proof
in
the
trial
that
was
there
is
no
space
available
on
the
gould
campus
for
any
further
construction
because
the
issue
tried
in
this
case
below,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
whether
we
should
build
this
new
proposed
high
school
building
on
the
site
that
the
school
board
had
secured
and
was
planning
on
building
on,
which
was
near
the
field
elementary
school,
or
whether
we
should
build
one
in
gould.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
certainly
the
proof
in
the
record
doesn't
support
that
assumption.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
would
certainly
concede
it's
a
possibility.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
what
really
was
a
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
suppose
that's
a
possibility.
of
course,
it's
--
as
your
honor
knows
from
the
dispute
in
the
prior
case
when
you
get
into
drawing
lines,
people
disagree
on
whether
the
line
--
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
but
one
of
the
failings
of
that
is
that
it
wouldn't
offer
the
opportunity
we
do
here
for
every
child
or
his
parent
on
his
behalf
to
make
a
full
and
free
choice
on
his
own
in
this
matter.
mr.
robert
v.
light
this
board
that
i
represent
considered
both
of
the
schools
now
your
honor.
i
want
to
say
something
of
freedom
of
choice
that
it
is
not
what
it
might
be
pictured
here
just
to
device
to
achieve
a
result
that
it
maybe
thought
that
we
have
set
out
to
achieve.
it's
an
old
procedure
in
education
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
how
it
works
at
the
collegiate
level.
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
since
they
started
building
colleges
in
this
country
300
years
ago
and
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
ever
since
the
states
got
into
the
business
of
offering
collegiate
training
to
their
citizens
and
even
in
the
states
where
formally
segregation
was
legal,
we've
had
freedom
of
choice
at
the
collegiate
level
since
some
years
before
brown
because
of
the
decision
to
this
court
in
sweatt
against
painter
and
mclaurin.
and
what
has
that
freedom
of
choice,
that
long
existing
freedom
of
choice
and
currently
freedom
of
choice
produced?
it's
produced
the
same
pattern
that
we've
got
in
this
school
district
with
respect
to
racial
attendance
and
the
same
pattern
you
have
in
the
virginia's
case,
the
school
district
with
respect
the
racial
pattern.
you
have
a
relatively
few
negro
students
going
to
white
educational,
predominantly
white
educational
institution.
and
the
gould
school
district
is
possibly
15%
of
the
negro
students
have
elected
the
old
to
the
previously
white
school
in
the
new
kent
county,
virginia,
i
believe
it's
about
18%.
that's
about
the
pattern
you
have
in
the
colleges
over
this
nation
as
the
result
of
freedom
of
choice.
the
vast
majority
of
these
people
and
the
court
can't
go
any
other
rational
inference,
i
don't
think
want
to
attend
school
with
members
of
their
own
race
and
that's
been
proved
year
after
year.
i've
never
heard
any
suggestion
that
any
intimidation
brought
about
that
pattern.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
there
would
be
a
serious
question.
i
believe
the
vast
majority
of
the
negro
students
in
this
nation
who
are
receiving
collegiate
training
are
in
predominantly
are
all
negro
schools
and
if
the
court
should
make
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
it's
unlawful
to
operate
an
all
negro
educational
institution
as
i
understand
the
petitioner
seek
to
have
invoked
here.
but
what
will
happen
to
all
of
those
negro
colleges
where
collegiate
training
is
now
being
received?
it's
a
serious
problem.
i
want
to
bring
down
realistically
in
concrete
fact
that
way
from
the
theories,
what
would
happen
if
this
court
adopted
the
rule
of
law
that
the
petitioner
seek
here?
they
have
suggested
as
their
alternative
or
feasible
alternative
although
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
that
it
was
feasible.
well,
this
issue
wasn't
even
tried
in
the
district
court
that
we
could
make
one
of
the
schools,
an
elementary
school
and
one
a
high
school.
if
we
did
that
your
honors,
the
high
school
would
contain
157
white
students
and
100
--
correction
--
and
247
negro
students.
and
i
had
erroneously
given
that
that
would
be
the
elementary
school.
the
high
school
would
contain
147
white
students
and
301
negro
students.
these
are
based
on
the
figures
supplied
by
the
petitioners
with
their
petition
for
certiorari.
they
file
the
hew
statistics
concerning
this
district
with
this
court
and
i've
taken
those
figures.
so
you've
got
approximately
two
negro
students
and
one
white
student
in
each
of
those
schools
and
i
think
that
if
we
examine
that
situation
with
candor
and
the
time
i
believe
has
come
for
candor
and
i
want
to
speak
to
the
court
with
candor
on
this
that
we
know
from
experience
that
the
white
students
will
not
continue
to
attend
those
schools.
that's
the
racial
breakdown
you'd
have
if
the
white
students
stayed
in
those
schools.
but
they
would
flee
just
as
inevitably
as
they
have
fled
from
the
public
schools
of
washington
dc
and
go
to
private
schools,
go
stay
with
relatives
in
some
other
school
district
but
they
leave
and
i
don't
know
how
to
characterize
the
reason
for
them
doing
that
any
better
than
to
say
in
all
sincerity
that
as
one
of
the
justices
suggested
this
morning,
i
believe
the
chief
justice,
that
we
can't
ignore
what's
going
on
for
a
hundred
years
in
that
community.
well,
we
can't
ignore
what's
going
on
for
a
hundred
years
in
that
community
and
whether
that
history
is
right
or
wrong,
whether
it's
more
with
christian
is
going
on.
it's
a
fact
that
we
have
to
deal
with
and
that
has
produced
two
groups
of
people
with
such
cultural
differences
in
that
community,
your
honor,
that
when
the
predominant
culture
becomes
that
of
the
negro
people
in
the
community,
the
white
people
flee
from
it.
it's
not
acceptable
term
and
to
say
this
that
difficult
thing
to
speak
with
--
to
speak
about
with
candor
but
i
feel
obliged
to
speak
about
it
with
candor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
oh,
no
sir.
your
honor,
to
answer
the
first
of
your
two
part
question.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
motive
of
the
school
board
and
this
has
been
inquired
about
before
doing
the
course
of
these
arguments.
if
the
motive
of
the
school
board
is
impertinent,
perhaps
it
is
if
adopted
this
alternative
from
among
the
several
that
it
had
to
look
at,
at
the
time
that
procedure
desegregate
these
schools
because
it's
the
only
one
it
could
adopt
in
its
judgment
not
concurring
its
judgment
that
wouldn't
destroy
the
public
schools
of
this
system.
it's
the
only
one
that
would
be
constitutional
that
it
gave
everybody
their
rights.
the
full
equality
of
the
law
and
yet
not
destroy
the
public
school
system
by
driving
out
a
substantial
segment
of
the
community
and
losing
the
support
for
the
public
schools
that
that
segment
of
the
community
provides.
i
--
i'm
fearful.
mr.
robert
v.
light
in
--
in
that
county?
mr.
robert
v.
light
none
of
which
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
presume
that
there
are
no
private
schools
and
in
fact,
i'm
relatively
certain
from
my
reading
that
there
are
no
private
schools
in
prince
edward
county,
virginia
until
the
recent
years.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
these
respondents
your
honor
will
comply
to
the
extent
within
their
power
with
whatever
order
of
this
court
enter.
i'm
concerned
about
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i'm
not
clairvoyant
not
to
project
that
but
i
imagine
that
it
would
largely
coincide
with
the
length
of
time
it
took
the
majority
of
the
negro
people
in
that
community
to
decide
that
they
didn't
want
to
keep
their
own
school
and
use
it
as
their
community
center
and
attend
school
with
members
of
their
own
race.
every
one
of
them
mr.
justice
marshall
has
this
right
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
arthur
lee
raney
is
in
the
gould
school
and
admitted
to
the
school
when
he
first
applied
in
1965
and
was
erroneously
listed
his
plane
fair.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i'm
speaking
for
all
the
negro's
in
saying
what
sir?
mr.
robert
v.
light
i'm
speaking
of
all
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
i'm
speaking
of
all
that
are
in
the
field
of
high
school
and
elementary
school
in
this
school
district
because
they've
had
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
it
goes
out
that
i
have
some
professional
contact
with
some
of
the
staff.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
why
i'm
not
speaking
furthermore
thinking
of
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
and
i
thought
i'd
selected
the
word
of,
i
meant
to
because
i'm
sensitive
to
mr.
greenberg
taking
the
position
that
he
speaks
for
all
negro's
when
i
know
that
he
does
not
and
cannot
be
impossible.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
i
respectfully
suggest
that
you've
taken
some
liberty
with
what
i
said.
i
--
i
have
said
that
the
negroes
in
the
field
school
complex,
all
freely
selected
to
go
there.
they're
there
because
they
want
to
be
there.
now
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
but
i
know
how
the
mechanics
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
they
filled
out
a
child's
form
to
get
there.
they
selected
the
school
and
now
those
that
are
in
the
higher
grade
before
1965,
originally
were
assigned
there
on
a
racial
basis.
mr.
robert
v.
light
how
do
they
get
out?
by
signing
a
document
such
as
the
one
that
mr.
greenberg
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
the
parents
in
some
instances,
the
child
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
--
that's
right,
simply
signing
in
there,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
claiborne
indicated
that
he
would
not
challenge
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
whites
to
flee
when
a
predominantly
negro
facility
develops.
i
have
evidence
to
support
that
in
the
form
of
the
report
of
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
cited
at
page
60
of
my
brief
where
they
say
there's
evidence
to
suggest
that
once
a
school
becomes
almost
half
or
majority
negro,
it
tends
rapidly
to
become
nearly
all
negro
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
experience
in
life
that
we've
had
all
over
the
country.
this
isn't
a
sudden
phenomenon.
i
do
not
want
to
be
understood
as
arguing
that
the
court
should
approve
the
freedom
of
choice
method
of
school
assignment
because
it's
the
only
one
that
will
preserve
the
public
schools
in
the
rural
south
at
least
that
it
is.
the
court
should
approve
it
because
it's
clearly
constitutional
where
it
accords
to
every
one
the
full
exercise
of
these
constitutional
rights.
and
incidentally,
it
will
preserve
the
public
schools.
i
think
that
it's
interesting
that
in
the
three
hours
of
argument
we've
been
talking
about
schools
and
we've
been
talking
about
desegregation
that
nothing
had
been
said
really
about
education
and
how
does
it
square
with
this
and
after
all
the
purpose
of
the
schools
is
to
educate
these
children
and
i
believe
that
the
voice
of
an
educator
should
be
before
the
court.
in
the
tennessee
case,
there's
a
large
appendix
of
many
writings
to
assist
the
court
in
determining
what
the
practical
things
would
be
if
you
strike
down
the
freedom
of
choice
here.
what
would
be
the
practical
effects
if
we're
required
to
adopt
the
plan
that
will
put
in
gould
school
district,
66
negro
students
and
33
white
students,
a
ratio
of
that
sort?
will
that
affect
the
education?
will
the
placement
of
two
hostile
groups
in
the
same
building
perpetuate
a
climate
where
education
can
take
place?
i
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
no.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
couldn't
attest
to
it
or
challenge
it.
i
have
not
made
those
observations
of
white
children
playing
together
so
i'm
not
in
position.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
have
not
but
my
occasion
to
be
in
gould
which
is
some
70
miles
perhaps
from
little
rock
would
not
be
frequent
enough
to
make
me
a
reliable
observer.
mr.
robert
v.
light
white
and
negro
children
playing
in
little
rock?
mr.
robert
v.
light
on
the
school
grounds
of
our
desegregated
schools
that's
a
common
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i'm
not
a
psychiatrist
or
a
sociologist.
