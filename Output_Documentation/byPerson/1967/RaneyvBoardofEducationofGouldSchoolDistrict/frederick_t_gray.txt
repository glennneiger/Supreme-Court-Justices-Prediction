mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
sir,
i
would
like
to
volunteer
my
distinction
of
the
california
case
from
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
if
i
could.
i
think
that
what
was
condemned
in
california
was
a
procedure
by
which
a
particular
individual
could
be
denied
the
right
to
acquire
that
which
he
was
seeking
to
acquire
but
under
a
freedom
of
choice
plan,
the
particular
individual
may
not
be
denied
the
right
to
acquire
that
which
he
is
seeking
to
acquire
and
i
think
that's
the
basic
distinction.
every
child
in
this
county
can
go
where
he
wants
to
go
and
even
though
--
i
can't
recall
whether
it
was
justice
brennan
or
justice
white
which
asked
me
about
the
pta
groups
getting
together.
i
think
it
was
justice
white
--
getting
together
in
deciding
that,
well,
all
the
colored
people
will
go
here
and
all
the
white
people
will
go
there.
of
course
that
result
and
i
answered
you
that
that
could
happen
but
it
can't
happen
against
the
wishes
of
any
one
person
because
any
one
person
that
wants
to
go
to
that
particular
school
could
of
course
choose
to
go
to
that
particular
school.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
sir.
but
the
point
here
is
that
that
if
i
were
the
seller,
that
would
give
me
the
right
to
discriminate
and
thus
deny
to
a
particular
individual
the
right
to
acquire
that
which
he
was
seeking
to
acquire.
but
under
the
freedom
of
choice
plan,
that
individual
can't
be
denied
what
he
--
i
can
still
seek
to
discriminate
but
i
can't
prevent
his
going
to
the
school
that
he
wants
to
go
to.
he
can
still
go
where
he
wants
to
go.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
am
assuming
that
in
my
case
because
in
my
case
sir,
the
record
says,
they
have
an
unrestricted
freedom
of
choice
and
i
was
delighted
that
you
mr.
justice
marshall
point
out
that
there
really
isn't
the
hostility,
that
the
children
play
together
and
go
every
thing
together,
that's
not
really
the
hostility
that
was
suppose.
certainly
in
new
kent
county,
virginia,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
any
subtle
forms
of
pressures
against
the
children
making
the
choice
that
they
want
to
make.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
in
some,
yes.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
in
some
ways,
i
think
that
is
true.
i
think
that
is
true
in
subtle
ways.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
any
basis,
choose
on
any
basis.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
any
basis.
in
the
petition
filed
in
the
new
kent
case,
there
was
a
--
i
thought
a
singularly
extraordinary
statement
that
the
new
kent
county
and
school
board
afforded
to
the
negro
children
and
i
quote,
“a
privilege
rarely
enjoyed
in
the
past,
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
school
of
their
choice.”
that
seems
to
be
a
very,
very
strange
thing
to
be
the
subject
of
an
appeal
that
they
should
have
taken
away
from
them
that
which
they
have
finally
achieved
legislative
bodies
at
one
point
said,
we
want
segregation.
we
want
choices
made
on
the
basis
of
race
and
you
struck
it
down
and
now
you
are
asked,
substitute
your
judgment
or
how
our
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
children's
parents
and
find
some
method
of
course
you
have.
if
you
have
residential
segregation,
well,
make
them
have
a
free
choice.
if
you
have
free
choice
segregation,
make
them
have
zoning.
do
something
but
don't
let
them
choose
what
they
want.
take
that
choice
away
from
them
again
on
racial
basis.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
to
say
if
i'm
trying
a
lawsuit,
i
have
to
try
it
on
my
record.
my
record
says
that
there's
no
restrictions
against
the
choices
in
new
kent
county
and
i
say
to
you
that
i
know
of
situations
in
virginia
where
white
children
have
chosen
to
go
to
college
schools
and
have
gone
and
their
parents
are
still
employed
and
i
know
of
no
--
nothing
untoward
that
happened
to
them
when
they
made
that
choice.
but
i'll
say
to
you
also
sir
that
there
isn't
a
white
person
in
new
kent
county
virginia
that
can
elect
to
send
their
trial
to
a
segregated
school
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
because
there
isn't
one
for
white
children
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
that
can
elect
to
send
their
child
to
a
segregated
school
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
because
there
isn't
one
for
white
children
in
new
kent
county,
virginia.
every
white
child
in
new
kent
county,
virginia
goes
to
a
racially
integrated
school.
now,
one
further
point
about
the
complications
of
this
going
to
vast
trouble
to
set
up
a
system,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
we
go
to
long
bus
routes
where
complicated
bus
routes
all
over
the
county
to
get
the
kids
to
these
two
schools.
he
then
suggest
that
you
could
turn
one
into
a
high
school
and
the
other
one
into
the
elementary
school
and
i
wonder
how
he
would
bust
the
children
without
running
those
buses
all
over
the
county
just
as
we
do
now.
if
you're
going
to
catch
them
from
all
over
the
county
to
the
two
schools
they're
going
to
run
buses
all
over
the
two
schools.
as
far
as
these
complicated
forms
are
concerned,
i
don't
know
of
a
simpler
way
in
the
world
to
find
out
which
children
are
going
where
than
to
ask
them
where
they
want
to
go.
if
you
draw
a
zone
line,
you're
going
to
take
a
census
and
find
out
wherever
child
in
that
county
lives
to
know
which
side
of
the
zone
it
will
go.
and
you're
going
to
still
have
to
get
his
part
together,
a
form
from
him
to
determine
his
age
and
his
name
and
all
the
other
factors
that
school
officials
always
get
from
children
when
they
go
to
school.
the
question
was
asked
me
in
opening
about
the
fact.
oh!
it
was
not
asked
to
me,
it
was
asked
mr.
tucker
about
the
faculty
in
the
--
to
the
comparative
faculty
in
new
kent
county.
we
don't
have
a
breakdown
of
the
entire
faculty
in
the
record.
there's
a
breakdown
of
the
faculty
that's
been
employed
for
the
last
five
years
and
by
way
of
comparison
on
the
11
white
teachers
who
had
been
employed,
five
of
them
do
not
have
a
collegiate
degree.
three
of
them
have
a
bs
degree,
one
has
a
bachelor
of
music
and
two
have
ba
so
we
have
six
with
bachelor's
degrees
and
five
with
no
degrees
and
of
the
college
teachers,
there
are
nine
with
bachelor's
degrees,
five
ba
degrees,
five
of
bs
degrees
and
one
with
no
degree.
so,
of
the
16
negro
teachers
hired
only
one
does
not
have
a
degree
and
of
the
11
white
teachers
hired,
five
have
no
degrees.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
the
overcrowding
of
the
schools
and
the
teacher
capacities
were
figures
as
of
three
years
ago.
with
115
colored
children
moving
into
the
white
school,
the
pupil-teacher
ratio
at
the
colored
school
is
now
less
than
that
at
the
school
which
has
just
been
integrated.
we
just
submit
in
closing
your
honors
that
we
come
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
go
beyond
anything
that
has
been
conceived
that
it
said
in
brown
unless
it
is
prepared
to
say
that
when
we
spoke
in
goss
and
said
that
if
you
had
a
completely
free
choice,
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
because
neither
the
parents
or
the
children
could
choose
free
of
racial
consideration
unless
you
are
in
fact
prepared
to
write
an
affirmative
command
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
freedom
of
choice
must
stand
as
a
constitutional
answer
to
the
command
of
brown.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
chief

may
it

the
court.
if
