justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
mr.
greenberg,
when
your
emphasis
is
on
remedy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you're
suggesting
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
this
is
constitutionally
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
principle
of
desegregation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
whether
or
not
the
constitution
compels
a
certain
way
of
accomplishing.
it's
not
so
much
the
problem
as
how
to
accomplish
desegregation
as
a
remedy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
problems
in
this
case,
mr.
greenberg,
of
quality
of
facilities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
phase
with
the
difference
in
salary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
namely
with
that
proximity
to
the
two
schools.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
were
enough
white
children
who
live
nearby
in
the
negro
school
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
may
i
ask.
do
i
read
your
brief
correctly
as
suggesting
that
at
least
in
the
new
kent
and
gould
case
that
this
court
had
only
should
say
that
the
--
in
those
instances,
the
free
choice
school
is
not
a
viable
alternative
but
indeed
that
we
should
go
beyond
that
and
require
that
the
school
board
adopt
a
geographical
zoning
plan?
is
that
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
i
understood
that
and
you
want
us
to
decide
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i'm
wrong
in
reading
your
brief
that's
suggesting
that
we
should
prescribe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
on
the
premise
that
we
did
but
then
what
do
we
do?
just
remand
and
tell
a
district
court
that
board
has
got
to
come
up
with
some
other
more
satisfactory
alternative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
you
--
what
you
do
supposedly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
say
that
these
two
it
appears
on
this
record
would
be
satisfactory
as
a
remedy
but
you
go
ahead
in
district
court
and
choose
between
them,
limiting
the
district
court
to
the
choice
between
the
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
you
think
it's
singularly
inappropriate
for
us
to
talk
and
prescribe
these
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
last,
that
happen
with
the
book?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
not
have
written
it.

j.
