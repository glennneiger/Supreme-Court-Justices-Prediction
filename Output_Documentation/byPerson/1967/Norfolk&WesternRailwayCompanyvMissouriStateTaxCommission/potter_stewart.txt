it's
not
--
it's
not
quite
that
blunt
measurement,
is
it?
you
speak
as
though
this
is
something
like
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
this
constitution.
it's
not
this
what
it's
grossly
excessive
whether
in
our
judgment
it's
too
high
or
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
the
constitutional
limitation
of
the
state
that
it
either
sometimes
framed
than
do
in
our
cases
in
due
process
terms,
sometimes
in
interstate
commerce
terms
that
the
state
is
exactly
more
than
it
can
constitutionally
can
from
this
interstate.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
has,
if
this
court
has
said
i
think
that
many
times
powered
a
tax
what
is
within
or
rationally
connected
with
that
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
wouldn't
i
suppose
contend
that
missouri
could
impose
a
tax
on
things
out
in
california
even
though
for
a
very
low
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
not
really
whether
it's
in
our
judgment
grossly
excessive,
that's
not
quite,
that's
all
i
ask.
