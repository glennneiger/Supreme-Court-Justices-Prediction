mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
is
challenging
an
assessment
of
its
rolling
stock
by
the
missouri
state
tax
commission.
in
brief,
its
claim
is
that
the
assessment
is
so
greatly
in
excess
of
the
actual
value
of
missouri,
of
norfolk
and
western
rolling
stock
that
was
in
missouri,
that
missouri
has
placed
out
of
state
values
on
its
tax
rolls
and
that
this
is
in
violation
of
both
the
due
process
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.
the
question
arises
in
this
way.
ordinarily,
in
the
case
of
the
of
an
interstate
railroad,
no
particular
unit
of
its
rolling
stock
will
be
in
a
particular
state
permanently
and
yet
it
is
said
to
be
permanent
presence
in
the
state
that
gives
a
state
jurisdiction
to
tax
an
object.
but
it's
been
recognized
that
it's
proper
for
a
state
to
be
able
to
tax
and
reach
in
some
manner
the
rolling
stock
that
is
constantly
passing
through
it.
so
in
recognition
of
this,
this
court
long
ago
reframed
situs
doctrines
so
as
to
permit
the
states
to
tax
an
average
amount
of
rolling
stock
that
was
in
the
state,
a
fraction
which
will
be
constantly
changing
in
content
but
which
will
be
more
or
less
stable
in
size
of
the
entire
uh
complement
of
locomotives
and
cars
that
are
on
there,
otherwise
controlled
by
the
railroad.
the
next
step
was
to
permit
the
states
to
determine
the
size
of
this
fraction
by
the
use
of
formulas.
missouri
assesses
rolling
stock
according
to
one
formula
a
form
of
the
mileage
or
trackage
formula.
under
this
formula,
a
railroad's
mileage,
branch
line
and
main
line
in
case
of
missouri,
mileage
is
computed
as
a
total,
as
a
percentage
of
its
total
such
mileage
and
this
percentage
is
then
applied
to
a
value
ascertained
for
the
entirety
of
the
carrier's
fleet
of
rolling
stock.
in
other
words,
if
a
railroad
had
a
10%
of
its
mileage
in
missouri,
missouri
would
attribute
to
itself
for
property
tax
purposes
10%
of
that
carrier's
--
the
value
of
that
carrier's
rolling
stock.
the
premise
for
the
use
of
this
formula
in
both
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
this
court
has
recognized
this
is
that
rolling
stock
is
roughly,
evenly
divided
throughout
a
railroad
system.
missouri
mileage
formula
was
first
applied
in
the
norfolk
and
western
in
1965.
that
was
after
the
n&w
had
acquired
by
lease
all
the
properties
of
the
wabash
railroad.before
the
--
before
that
lease,
which
took
back
at
october
16,
1964,
the
norfolk
and
western
did
not
operate
in
missouri,
although
the
wabash
and
lines
in
operations
there.
the
missouri
statute
and
terms
applies
to
property
owned
hired
or
leased
by
a
railroad.
on
this
basis,
the
missouri's
tax
commission
asked
and
received
from
the
n&w
a
detailed
statement
of
its
mileage
owned
or
leased
in
missouri
and
elsewhere
and
of
its
units
of
rolling
stock
and
their
value
at
cost
less
accrued
depreciation.
most
of
the
cars
and
locomotives
that
the
n&w
returned
in
this
manner
to
the
tax
commission
were
coal
carrying
equipment
used
in
the
well
known
n&w
coal
operation
from
the
mines
of
virginia,
west
virginia
and
kentucky,
to
tide
water
and
the
great
lakes.
as
it
turned
out,
the
missouri
mileage
was
about
eight
and
a
quarter
percent
of
the
n&w's
total
mileage.
the
commission
took
47%
of
this
cost
less
depreciation
figures
that
the
n&w
had
supplied
as
the
value
of
its--
of
its
rolling
stocks
as
the
assessed
or
equalized
value
of
the
entire
fleet
of
rolling
stock.
it
used
that
same
47%
factor
for
all
railroads
in
the
state
in
that
year
and
when
applied
to
the
equalized
value
of
the
entire
fleet,
the
eight
and
a
quarter
percent
mileage
factor
yielded
an
assessment
of
nearly
$20
million.
it
is
that
assessment
of
rolling
stock
that's
in
issue
here.
it
appeared
suspect
at
once
that
assessment
because
in
the
previous
year,
the
rolling
stock
of
the
wabash
in
the
hands
of
the
wabash
had
been
assessed
at
only
a
little
more
than
$9
million
and
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
missouri
operations
as
a
result
of
the
lease
of
the
properties
to
the
--
to
the
n&w
such
as
would
logically
it
was
thought
lead
to
any
such
inquiries
in
the
value
of
the
fleet
that
was
in
missouri.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
purpose
of
the
missouri
formula
is
to
get
at
the
value
of
the
rolling
stock
within
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
--
in
the
previous
year,
it
was
quite
true,
only
wabash
rolling
stock
was
sought
to
be
valued
but
it
was
thought
and
indeed
the
evidence
at
the
hearing
before
the
state
tax
commission
showed
that
the
most
of
the
rolling
stock
of
the
n&w
that
was
in
missouri
in
1965
was
that
rolling
stock
which
had
been
leased
from
the
wabash.
mr.
william
h.
allen
so
that
the
two
complements
of
rolling
stock
were
roughly
comparable.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
was
the
same
47%.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
same
47%.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
would've
been
the
same
with
one
year
further
advance
a
particular
car
can
be.
mr.
william
h.
allen
to
nearly
20
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
because
in
the
increase
of
the
trackage
factor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
none
but
that
trackage
was
a
--
a
percentage
of
the
entire
n&w.
i
should
not
have
said
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
was
an
increase
in
the
trackage
factor.
no.
that
trackage
factor
was
a
per
--
in
1965
was
a
percentage
of
the
total
n&w
trackage
and
was
applied
to
the
entire
value
of
the
n&w
fleet
which
is
in
four
five
times
the
size
of
the
wabash
fleet.
now,
the
trackage
factor
in
the
previous
year
had
been
a
percentage
of
the
total
wabash
trackage
and
applied
to
the
total
equalized
value
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
the
wabash
fleet.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
do
not
know
the
answer
of
that.
25%
i
believe.
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
the
formula
had
been
valuably
applied
through
the
years
of
the
n&w
that's
quite
true
and
the
assertion
is
not
that
the
mere
inquiry
shows
that
it
is
enough
to
prove
the
formula
is
invaluably
applied
but
when
there
is
no
real
change
in
what
is
sought
to
be
measured
by
the
formula,
it
is
an
indication
that
something
is
wrong.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
n
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
the
--
the
n&w
presented
evidence
concerning
valuation
or
the
hearing
that
was
held
on
its
protest.
the
basic
evidence
on
this
score
was
a
count
of
cars
that
were
in
missouri
on
tax
day
and
on
various
days
in
1964.
now,
the
--
the
number
of
cars
on
missouri
on
tax
day
came
to
somewhat
less
than
3%
and
not
more
than
8%
of
the
n&w's
total
fleet,
and
by
value,
they
represented
something
a
little
bit
more
than
3%
and
not
a
percent
of
the
n&w's
total
fleet.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
if
you
computed
that
in
the
same
way
that
the
tax
commission
computed
the
value
for
the
entire
fleet
that
is
by
taking
47%
of
the
cost
less
depreciation.
it
would
come
to
somewhat
more
than
$7.5
million
dollars.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
and
there
were
studies
as
i
say
for
other
days
during
1964
and
those
studies
indicated
that
tax
day
was
by
no
means
unrepresentative
of
the
average
presence
of
missouri
of
n&w
rolling
stock.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
tax
commission
said
it
was
bound
to
tax
all
railroads
in
the
same
manner
under
the
mileage
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
supreme
court
did
not
disagree
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
although
the
supreme
court
suggested
at
one
point
in
its
opinion
on
a
slightly
different
manner
that
the
--
that
the
tax
commission
was
free
to
consider
other
matters.
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
this
is
an
expression
of
state
law
but
they
are
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
in
event,
well,
the
state
law
has
been
so
applied
as
to
amount
to
a
mere
mechanical
application
of
mileage
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
car
counts
on
tax
day
and
other
days,
there
was
a
study
of
traffic
density
in
missouri
which
the
indicated
reason
why
there
was
this
discrepancy
because
the
density
study
showed
that
each
mile
of
track
in
missouri
was
responsible
for
about
half
the
traffic
of
the
average
mile
of
track
on
the
n&w
system
which
according
to
the
man
who
sponsored,
the
study
showed
that
there
would
be
that
much
less
equipment
in
missouri
to
handle
that
most
ton
miles
of
traffic.
and
finally,
there
was
--
there
was
general
evidence
of
the
kind
i've
suggested
that
the
operations
in
missouri
have
not
in
fact
changed
as
a
result
of
the
wabash
becoming
a
part
of
the
larger
n&w
system
and
this
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
n&w
at
the
hearing
before
the
tax
commission
was
uncontroverted
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
the
tax
commission
said
that
it
was
bound
to
assess
all
railroads
in
the
same
way
according
to
the
mileage
formula,
the
n&w
had
not
shown
that
the
assessment
was
grossly
excessive.
the
n&w
petitioned
for
review
of
the
tax
court's
decisions
and
the
missouri
state
courts
and
ultimately
the
missouri
supreme
court
rejected
the
constitutional
claims
that
were
renewed
in
those
courts
and
primarily
because
of
i
think
primarily
because
of
a
misconception
of
a
doctrine
that's
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
the
entitlement
of
states
to
a
--
in
their
--
exercise
their
taxing
powers
take
a
share
of
the
total
enterprise
value
of
a
railroad
or
other
interstate
enterprise.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
pure
mileage
approach?
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
only
two
others
on
the
n&w
system
that
due.
as
among
the
50
states,
your
honor,
i
attempted
to
get
published
information
on
this
and
it's
virtually
impossible
to
come
by.
i
would
think
no
more
than
ten.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
only
two.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
will
be
14
states
involved.
mr.
william
h.
allen
only
three
in
addition
to
missouri,
i
should
have
said.
now,
i'd
get
to
that
misconception
that
the
supreme
court
entertained
in
a
moment.
but
first
i
want
to
discuss
the
basic
proposition
on
which
we
rely
in
this
case.
the
premise
as
i've
said
of
any
valid
mileage
formula
has
to
be
that
the
property
that
is
being
allocated
to
the
state
in
this
case
rolling
stock
is
more
or
less
evenly
divided
throughout
the
system
and
or
at
least
that
there
is
no
concentration
of
value
outside
the
taxing
state
that
the
mile
--
so
that
the
miles
of
track
in
the
taxing
state
are
not
representative
of
the
division
of
value
throughout
the
system.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes,
yes.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
as
common
sense
of
point,
as
your
honor's
question
makes
it
and
it
has
been
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
applying
this
common
sense
that
where
a
mileage
formula
produces
that
kind
of
result,
it
does
amount
to
an
attempt
to
tax
out
of
state
property
and
that
violates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
proof
--
the
proof
of
that
is
to
count
of
cars
on
tax
day
and
on
days
throughout
1964.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
way
mr.
justice
brennan
phrased
the
point
is
this
that
a
state
is
entitled
by
a
formula
if
that
proves
convenient
to
get
at
the
fraction
of
a
carrier's
rolling
stock
that
is
always
in
the
state.
the
certain
number
of
cars
will
be
--
they
won't
be
the
same
cars,
although
there
would
be
some
of
them
that
are
permanent
layer
and
virtually
present
in
the
state.
let
us
say
that
figure
is
a
thousand
cars,
the
mileage
formula
may
or
may
not
result
in
reaching
that
fraction.
where
it
results
in
reaching
or
in
attributing
to
the
state
2000
cars,
it
is
in
effect
bringing
into
the
state
out
of
state
values
because
the
extra
thousand
cars
have
no
such
relationship
with
the
state
as
to
make
them
taxable.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
right.
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
the
state
used
the
same
formula,
they
would
be
likely
undertaxed
and
the
case
that
originally
proved
the
use
of
the
mileage
formula,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
that
approved
its
general
validity.
the
pullman's
palace
car
company
against
pennsylvania
back
in
1891,
the
court
said
that
if
every
state
used
the
formula,
things
would
work
out
fine.
although
the
tank
carrier
cannot
be
taxed
on
more
than
100%
of
its
property
but
the
fact
is
because
of
the
very
reason
that
the
mileage
formula
is
an
inaccurate
method
of
getting
at
this
permitted
fraction
of
property.
not
all
states
do
use
it
and
states
like
west
virginia.
mr.
william
h.
allen
states
like
west
virginia
have
more
sophisticated
formulas
that
take
into
account
density
of
traffic.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct
and
there
--
this
has
a
tradition
in
this
court
and
there
are
cases
in
which
the
general
validity
of
mileage
formula
has
been
sustained
but
in
which
subsequently
in
cases
involving
those
same
statutes
that
were
sustained,
they
have
been
invalidated
in
application.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
method
is
statutory.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
what
value
are
you
using
or
what
value
are
you
dividing
by
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
i
--
no,
your
honor.
indeed
there,
the
early
--
the
cases
i
think
of
which
this
court
has
validated
mileage
formula
have
been
in
effect
of
doubt
where
it
tribute
so
much
value
to
each
mile
of
track,
as
it
what
it
amounts
to
and
where
values
of
the
whole
system
are
concentrated
out
of
the
state,
it's
the
same
as
if
rolling
stock,
it's
concentrated
out
of
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
allen
for
the
reason
that
you
are
--
that
in
that
case
the
state
is
in
substance
justice
in
this
one
taking
out
of
state
values
into
its
taxing
power.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
is
an
ad
valorem
tax
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
they
don't
--
they
don't
concern
us
directly.
i
will
say
that
among
the
cases
that
we
have
relied
upon,
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
invalidate
mileage
formulas
in
their
application,
there
are
some
that
deal
with
franchise
taxes,
with
taxes
on
total
capital,
taxes
on
total
property.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh
no.
no,
there's
no
such
argument.
the
day
for
making
that
argument
is
long
past.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
i
submit
that
it
has
long
passed.
yes,
your
honor,
since
1904.
the
basis
on
which
missouri
supreme
court
sustained
the
assessment
by
the
state
tax
commission
was
to
say
that
the
excess
of
value
between
the
$20
million
or
nearly
$20
million
that
the
mileage
formula
produced
and
the
actual
value
of
n&w
rolling
stock
in
missouri
was
justified
by
so
called
enhanced
or
augmented
value
given
to
the
rolling
stock
by
its
becoming
a
part
of
the
n&w
system.
now,
there
are
certainly
cases
in
which
this
court
as
i
say
has
talked
about
the
power
of
states
to
get
out
entire
enterprise
value
or
enhance
value
and
some
of
those
cases
have
also
involved
mileage
formulas
but
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
a
mileage
formula
and
enhanced
values.
the
mileage
formula
maybe
used
as
this
mileage
formula
simply
to
allocate
to
a
state
its
share
of
the
value
of
rolling
stock
computed
on
a
cost
less
depreciation
method.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
is
both
and
in
all
the
cases,
that
in
which
--
in
which
the
issue
has
arisen
or
either
the
case
has
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
assume
it
doesn't
have
to
be
both.
i
think
the
same
facts
established
the
violation
of
both,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
because
the
carrier
has
been
subjected
to
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
on
its
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
don't
think
that
has
been
the
approach
to
waive
for
actual
multiple
burden.
the
fact
is
that
one
can
look
at
the
formulas
that
other
states
used
with
which
to
tax
the
n&w
and
see
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
a
multiple
burden.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
there
--
but
the
problem
mr.
justice
white
is
that
not
all
the
states
do
have
this
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no
i
think
you
can
demonstrate
it
by
reference
to
the
taxing
laws
and
practices
of
the
other
states
in
which
the
n&w
operates,
i
think
they
can
be
noticed.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
cannot
say
that
it
appears
in
the
record
before
the
state
tax
commission.
i
can't
say
it
appears
in
published
materials
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
not.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
look
to
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
--
i
would
--
my
instinct
is
to
say
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
how
does
this
differ?
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
may
not
have
to
your
honor.
it's
simply
that
we
have
relied
on
both
clauses
and
the
court
has
relied
on
both
clauses
in
all
the
cases
decided
at
this
point.
well
we
would
respect
to
the
missouri
supreme
court's
discussion
of
enhancement
of
value,
we
merely
submit
that
the
court
has
in
that
discussion
has
confused
the
two
separate
problems
of
valuation
and
allocation
that
the
valuation
here
is
unquestioned,
cost
less
depreciation
of
the
entire
fleet.
it
is
the
method
of
allocation
that
that
is
an
issue
and
one
cannot
say
that
there
was
any
particular
enhanced
value
attributed
to
the
n&w's
fleet
of
rolling
stock
before
that
allocation
was
made.
mr.
william
h.
allen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
missouri
i
assume
could
have
attributed
a
greater
value
to
the
total
rolling,
fee
of
rolling
of
the
n&w
by
reason
of
--
very
reason
of
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
to
the
3000
cars.
but
the
fact
is
that
only
3%
of
those
cars
were
in
missouri.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
might
raise
a
different
question.
we
would
not
raise
this
question.
i
assume
they
may
be
able
to
do
something
about,
so
that
as
long
as
it's
equitable
under
the
treatment
of
the
railroads.
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
can't
tax
the
2000
cars
merely
because
of
a
merger.
no.
mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
is
challenging
an
assessment
of
its
rolling
stock
by
the
missouri
state
tax
commission.
in
brief,
its
claim
is
that
the
assessment
is
so
greatly
in
excess
of
the
actual
value
of
missouri,
of
norfolk
and
western
rolling
stock
that
was
in
missouri,
that
missouri
has
placed
out
of
state
values
on
its
tax
rolls
and
that
this
is
in
violation
of
both
the
due
process
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.
the
question
arises
in
this
way.
ordinarily,
in
the
case
of
the
of
an
interstate
railroad,
no
particular
unit
of
its
rolling
stock
will
be
in
a
particular
state
permanently
and
yet
it
is
said
to
be
permanent
presence
in
the
state
that
gives
a
state
jurisdiction
to
tax
an
object.
but
it's
been
recognized
that
it's
proper
for
a
state
to
be
able
to
tax
and
reach
in
some
manner
the
rolling
stock
that
is
constantly
passing
through
it.
so
in
recognition
of
this,
this
court
long
ago
reframed
situs
doctrines
so
as
to
permit
the
states
to
tax
an
average
amount
of
rolling
stock
that
was
in
the
state,
a
fraction
which
will
be
constantly
changing
in
content
but
which
will
be
more
or
less
stable
in
size
of
the
entire
uh
complement
of
locomotives
and
cars
that
are
on
there,
otherwise
controlled
by
the
railroad.
the
next
step
was
to
permit
the
states
to
determine
the
size
of
this
fraction
by
the
use
of
formulas.
missouri
assesses
rolling
stock
according
to
one
formula
a
form
of
the
mileage
or
trackage
formula.
under
this
formula,
a
railroad's
mileage,
branch
line
and
main
line
in
case
of
missouri,
mileage
is
computed
as
a
total,
as
a
percentage
of
its
total
such
mileage
and
this
percentage
is
then
applied
to
a
value
ascertained
for
the
entirety
of
the
carrier's
fleet
of
rolling
stock.
in
other
words,
if
a
railroad
had
a
10%
of
its
mileage
in
missouri,
missouri
would
attribute
to
itself
for
property
tax
purposes
10%
of
that
carrier's
--
the
value
of
that
carrier's
rolling
stock.
the
premise
for
the
use
of
this
formula
in
both
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
this
court
has
recognized
this
is
that
rolling
stock
is
roughly,
evenly
divided
throughout
a
railroad
system.
missouri
mileage
formula
was
first
applied
in
the
norfolk
and
western
in
1965.
that
was
after
the
n&w
had
acquired
by
lease
all
the
properties
of
the
wabash
railroad.before
the
--
before
that
lease,
which
took
back
at
october
16,
1964,
the
norfolk
and
western
did
not
operate
in
missouri,
although
the
wabash
and
lines
in
operations
there.
the
missouri
statute
and
terms
applies
to
property
owned
hired
or
leased
by
a
railroad.
on
this
basis,
the
missouri's
tax
commission
asked
and
received
from
the
n&w
a
detailed
statement
of
its
mileage
owned
or
leased
in
missouri
and
elsewhere
and
of
its
units
of
rolling
stock
and
their
value
at
cost
less
accrued
depreciation.
most
of
the
cars
and
locomotives
that
the
n&w
returned
in
this
manner
to
the
tax
commission
were
coal
carrying
equipment
used
in
the
well
known
n&w
coal
operation
from
the
mines
of
virginia,
west
virginia
and
kentucky,
to
tide
water
and
the
great
lakes.
as
it
turned
out,
the
missouri
mileage
was
about
eight
and
a
quarter
percent
of
the
n&w's
total
mileage.
the
commission
took
47%
of
this
cost
less
depreciation
figures
that
the
n&w
had
supplied
as
the
value
of
its--
of
its
rolling
stocks
as
the
assessed
or
equalized
value
of
the
entire
fleet
of
rolling
stock.
it
used
that
same
47%
factor
for
all
railroads
in
the
state
in
that
year
and
when
applied
to
the
equalized
value
of
the
entire
fleet,
the
eight
and
a
quarter
percent
mileage
factor
yielded
an
assessment
of
nearly
$20
million.
it
is
that
assessment
of
rolling
stock
that's
in
issue
here.
it
appeared
suspect
at
once
that
assessment
because
in
the
previous
year,
the
rolling
stock
of
the
wabash
in
the
hands
of
the
wabash
had
been
assessed
at
only
a
little
more
than
$9
million
and
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
missouri
operations
as
a
result
of
the
lease
of
the
properties
to
the
--
to
the
n&w
such
as
would
logically
it
was
thought
lead
to
any
such
inquiries
in
the
value
of
the
fleet
that
was
in
missouri.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
purpose
of
the
missouri
formula
is
to
get
at
the
value
of
the
rolling
stock
within
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
--
in
the
previous
year,
it
was
quite
true,
only
wabash
rolling
stock
was
sought
to
be
valued
but
it
was
thought
and
indeed
the
evidence
at
the
hearing
before
the
state
tax
commission
showed
that
the
most
of
the
rolling
stock
of
the
n&w
that
was
in
missouri
in
1965
was
that
rolling
stock
which
had
been
leased
from
the
wabash.
mr.
william
h.
allen
so
that
the
two
complements
of
rolling
stock
were
roughly
comparable.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
was
the
same
47%.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
same
47%.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
would've
been
the
same
with
one
year
further
advance
a
particular
car
can
be.
mr.
william
h.
allen
to
nearly
20
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
because
in
the
increase
of
the
trackage
factor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
none
but
that
trackage
was
a
--
a
percentage
of
the
entire
n&w.
i
should
not
have
said
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
was
an
increase
in
the
trackage
factor.
no.
that
trackage
factor
was
a
per
--
in
1965
was
a
percentage
of
the
total
n&w
trackage
and
was
applied
to
the
entire
value
of
the
n&w
fleet
which
is
in
four
five
times
the
size
of
the
wabash
fleet.
now,
the
trackage
factor
in
the
previous
year
had
been
a
percentage
of
the
total
wabash
trackage
and
applied
to
the
total
equalized
value
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--
the
wabash
fleet.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
do
not
know
the
answer
of
that.
25%
i
believe.
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
the
formula
had
been
valuably
applied
through
the
years
of
the
n&w
that's
quite
true
and
the
assertion
is
not
that
the
mere
inquiry
shows
that
it
is
enough
to
prove
the
formula
is
invaluably
applied
but
when
there
is
no
real
change
in
what
is
sought
to
be
measured
by
the
formula,
it
is
an
indication
that
something
is
wrong.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
n
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no.
the
--
the
n&w
presented
evidence
concerning
valuation
or
the
hearing
that
was
held
on
its
protest.
the
basic
evidence
on
this
score
was
a
count
of
cars
that
were
in
missouri
on
tax
day
and
on
various
days
in
1964.
now,
the
--
the
number
of
cars
on
missouri
on
tax
day
came
to
somewhat
less
than
3%
and
not
more
than
8%
of
the
n&w's
total
fleet,
and
by
value,
they
represented
something
a
little
bit
more
than
3%
and
not
a
percent
of
the
n&w's
total
fleet.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
if
you
computed
that
in
the
same
way
that
the
tax
commission
computed
the
value
for
the
entire
fleet
that
is
by
taking
47%
of
the
cost
less
depreciation.
it
would
come
to
somewhat
more
than
$7.5
million
dollars.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
and
there
were
studies
as
i
say
for
other
days
during
1964
and
those
studies
indicated
that
tax
day
was
by
no
means
unrepresentative
of
the
average
presence
of
missouri
of
n&w
rolling
stock.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
tax
commission
said
it
was
bound
to
tax
all
railroads
in
the
same
manner
under
the
mileage
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
supreme
court
did
not
disagree
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
although
the
supreme
court
suggested
at
one
point
in
its
opinion
on
a
slightly
different
manner
that
the
--
that
the
tax
commission
was
free
to
consider
other
matters.
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
this
is
an
expression
of
state
law
but
they
are
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
in
event,
well,
the
state
law
has
been
so
applied
as
to
amount
to
a
mere
mechanical
application
of
mileage
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
car
counts
on
tax
day
and
other
days,
there
was
a
study
of
traffic
density
in
missouri
which
the
indicated
reason
why
there
was
this
discrepancy
because
the
density
study
showed
that
each
mile
of
track
in
missouri
was
responsible
for
about
half
the
traffic
of
the
average
mile
of
track
on
the
n&w
system
which
according
to
the
man
who
sponsored,
the
study
showed
that
there
would
be
that
much
less
equipment
in
missouri
to
handle
that
most
ton
miles
of
traffic.
and
finally,
there
was
--
there
was
general
evidence
of
the
kind
i've
suggested
that
the
operations
in
missouri
have
not
in
fact
changed
as
a
result
of
the
wabash
becoming
a
part
of
the
larger
n&w
system
and
this
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
n&w
at
the
hearing
before
the
tax
commission
was
uncontroverted
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
the
tax
commission
said
that
it
was
bound
to
assess
all
railroads
in
the
same
way
according
to
the
mileage
formula,
the
n&w
had
not
shown
that
the
assessment
was
grossly
excessive.
the
n&w
petitioned
for
review
of
the
tax
court's
decisions
and
the
missouri
state
courts
and
ultimately
the
missouri
supreme
court
rejected
the
constitutional
claims
that
were
renewed
in
those
courts
and
primarily
because
of
i
think
primarily
because
of
a
misconception
of
a
doctrine
that's
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
the
entitlement
of
states
to
a
--
in
their
--
exercise
their
taxing
powers
take
a
share
of
the
total
enterprise
value
of
a
railroad
or
other
interstate
enterprise.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
pure
mileage
approach?
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
only
two
others
on
the
n&w
system
that
due.
as
among
the
50
states,
your
honor,
i
attempted
to
get
published
information
on
this
and
it's
virtually
impossible
to
come
by.
i
would
think
no
more
than
ten.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
are
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
only
two.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
will
be
14
states
involved.
mr.
william
h.
allen
only
three
in
addition
to
missouri,
i
should
have
said.
now,
i'd
get
to
that
misconception
that
the
supreme
court
entertained
in
a
moment.
but
first
i
want
to
discuss
the
basic
proposition
on
which
we
rely
in
this
case.
the
premise
as
i've
said
of
any
valid
mileage
formula
has
to
be
that
the
property
that
is
being
allocated
to
the
state
in
this
case
rolling
stock
is
more
or
less
evenly
divided
throughout
the
system
and
or
at
least
that
there
is
no
concentration
of
value
outside
the
taxing
state
that
the
mile
--
so
that
the
miles
of
track
in
the
taxing
state
are
not
representative
of
the
division
of
value
throughout
the
system.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes,
yes.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
as
common
sense
of
point,
as
your
honor's
question
makes
it
and
it
has
been
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
applying
this
common
sense
that
where
a
mileage
formula
produces
that
kind
of
result,
it
does
amount
to
an
attempt
to
tax
out
of
state
property
and
that
violates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
proof
--
the
proof
of
that
is
to
count
of
cars
on
tax
day
and
on
days
throughout
1964.
mr.
william
h.
allen
the
way
mr.
justice
brennan
phrased
the
point
is
this
that
a
state
is
entitled
by
a
formula
if
that
proves
convenient
to
get
at
the
fraction
of
a
carrier's
rolling
stock
that
is
always
in
the
state.
the
certain
number
of
cars
will
be
--
they
won't
be
the
same
cars,
although
there
would
be
some
of
them
that
are
permanent
layer
and
virtually
present
in
the
state.
let
us
say
that
figure
is
a
thousand
cars,
the
mileage
formula
may
or
may
not
result
in
reaching
that
fraction.
where
it
results
in
reaching
or
in
attributing
to
the
state
2000
cars,
it
is
in
effect
bringing
into
the
state
out
of
state
values
because
the
extra
thousand
cars
have
no
such
relationship
with
the
state
as
to
make
them
taxable.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that's
right.
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
if
the
state
used
the
same
formula,
they
would
be
likely
undertaxed
and
the
case
that
originally
proved
the
use
of
the
mileage
formula,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
that
approved
its
general
validity.
the
pullman's
palace
car
company
against
pennsylvania
back
in
1891,
the
court
said
that
if
every
state
used
the
formula,
things
would
work
out
fine.
although
the
tank
carrier
cannot
be
taxed
on
more
than
100%
of
its
property
but
the
fact
is
because
of
the
very
reason
that
the
mileage
formula
is
an
inaccurate
method
of
getting
at
this
permitted
fraction
of
property.
not
all
states
do
use
it
and
states
like
west
virginia.
mr.
william
h.
allen
states
like
west
virginia
have
more
sophisticated
formulas
that
take
into
account
density
of
traffic.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct
and
there
--
this
has
a
tradition
in
this
court
and
there
are
cases
in
which
the
general
validity
of
mileage
formula
has
been
sustained
but
in
which
subsequently
in
cases
involving
those
same
statutes
that
were
sustained,
they
have
been
invalidated
in
application.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
method
is
statutory.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
what
value
are
you
using
or
what
value
are
you
dividing
by
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
i
--
no,
your
honor.
indeed
there,
the
early
--
the
cases
i
think
of
which
this
court
has
validated
mileage
formula
have
been
in
effect
of
doubt
where
it
tribute
so
much
value
to
each
mile
of
track,
as
it
what
it
amounts
to
and
where
values
of
the
whole
system
are
concentrated
out
of
the
state,
it's
the
same
as
if
rolling
stock,
it's
concentrated
out
of
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
allen
for
the
reason
that
you
are
--
that
in
that
case
the
state
is
in
substance
justice
in
this
one
taking
out
of
state
values
into
its
taxing
power.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
is
an
ad
valorem
tax
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
they
don't
--
they
don't
concern
us
directly.
i
will
say
that
among
the
cases
that
we
have
relied
upon,
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
invalidate
mileage
formulas
in
their
application,
there
are
some
that
deal
with
franchise
taxes,
with
taxes
on
total
capital,
taxes
on
total
property.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
oh
no.
no,
there's
no
such
argument.
the
day
for
making
that
argument
is
long
past.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
--
i
submit
that
it
has
long
passed.
yes,
your
honor,
since
1904.
the
basis
on
which
missouri
supreme
court
sustained
the
assessment
by
the
state
tax
commission
was
to
say
that
the
excess
of
value
between
the
$20
million
or
nearly
$20
million
that
the
mileage
formula
produced
and
the
actual
value
of
n&w
rolling
stock
in
missouri
was
justified
by
so
called
enhanced
or
augmented
value
given
to
the
rolling
stock
by
its
becoming
a
part
of
the
n&w
system.
now,
there
are
certainly
cases
in
which
this
court
as
i
say
has
talked
about
the
power
of
states
to
get
out
entire
enterprise
value
or
enhance
value
and
some
of
those
cases
have
also
involved
mileage
formulas
but
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
a
mileage
formula
and
enhanced
values.
the
mileage
formula
maybe
used
as
this
mileage
formula
simply
to
allocate
to
a
state
its
share
of
the
value
of
rolling
stock
computed
on
a
cost
less
depreciation
method.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
is
both
and
in
all
the
cases,
that
in
which
--
in
which
the
issue
has
arisen
or
either
the
case
has
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
assume
it
doesn't
have
to
be
both.
i
think
the
same
facts
established
the
violation
of
both,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
because
the
carrier
has
been
subjected
to
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
on
its
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
don't
think
that
has
been
the
approach
to
waive
for
actual
multiple
burden.
the
fact
is
that
one
can
look
at
the
formulas
that
other
states
used
with
which
to
tax
the
n&w
and
see
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
a
multiple
burden.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
there
--
but
the
problem
mr.
justice
white
is
that
not
all
the
states
do
have
this
formula.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
no
i
think
you
can
demonstrate
it
by
reference
to
the
taxing
laws
and
practices
of
the
other
states
in
which
the
n&w
operates,
i
think
they
can
be
noticed.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
cannot
say
that
it
appears
in
the
record
before
the
state
tax
commission.
i
can't
say
it
appears
in
published
materials
that
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
not.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
look
to
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
would
--
i
would
--
my
instinct
is
to
say
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
how
does
this
differ?
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
may
not
have
to
your
honor.
it's
simply
that
we
have
relied
on
both
clauses
and
the
court
has
relied
on
both
clauses
in
all
the
cases
decided
at
this
point.
well
we
would
respect
to
the
missouri
supreme
court's
discussion
of
enhancement
of
value,
we
merely
submit
that
the
court
has
in
that
discussion
has
confused
the
two
separate
problems
of
valuation
and
allocation
that
the
valuation
here
is
unquestioned,
cost
less
depreciation
of
the
entire
fleet.
it
is
the
method
of
allocation
that
that
is
an
issue
and
one
cannot
say
that
there
was
any
particular
enhanced
value
attributed
to
the
n&w's
fleet
of
rolling
stock
before
that
allocation
was
made.
mr.
william
h.
allen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
missouri
i
assume
could
have
attributed
a
greater
value
to
the
total
rolling,
fee
of
rolling
of
the
n&w
by
reason
of
--
very
reason
of
--
mr.
william
h.
allen
to
the
3000
cars.
but
the
fact
is
that
only
3%
of
those
cars
were
in
missouri.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
might
raise
a
different
question.
we
would
not
raise
this
question.
i
assume
they
may
be
able
to
do
something
about,
so
that
as
long
as
it's
equitable
under
the
treatment
of
the
railroads.
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
can't
tax
the
2000
cars
merely
because
of
a
merger.
no.
