justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
the
--
was
the
valuation
factor
in
the
hands
of
wabash
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
same
47%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
n&w
has
returned
that
is
the
cost
less
depreciation
figure
on
the
wabash
holding
stock.
would
it
have
been
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
this
all
--
then
this
increase
from
$9
to
$20
million
you're
talking
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
of
the
increase
in
the
trackage
factors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
what
trackage
in
addition
to
the
wabash
trackage
did
the
n&w
have
in
missouri?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
what
that
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
what
that
was
in
the
hands
of
wabash?
what
was
the
trackage
factor
in
the
hands
of
wabash?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
n&w's
submission
as
to
what
the
correct
text
should
have
been?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
something
in
the
excess
of
$9
million
but
less
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
roughly
what
would
that
compute
out
to
in
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
much
less
that
had
been
paid
by
the
wabash,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
finding
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
n&w
approach
was
not
permissible
on
the
state
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
supreme
court
disagree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
we
just
going
to
take
that
is
the
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
are
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
stand
therefore
under
constitutional
attachment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
work
this
way,
mr.
allen?
is
your
constitutional
premise
that
of
course
they're
entitled
in
effect
to
tax
a
thousand
cars
a
day
if
it
works
out
that
there
are
thousand
cars
a
day
in
the
state
of
missouri,
they
won't
be
the
same
cost.
that's
in
effect
what
it
is.
by
the
way
this
taxing
scheme
has
worked,
as
applied
in
any
event,
you
had
only
a
thousand
cars
a
day
but
in
the
effect,
you've
been
taxing
two
thousand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
of
course,
mr.
allen,
i
don't
understand
that
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
per
setting
this
formula
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
just
addressing
your
case
to
the
application
of
that
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
producing
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
isn't
just
an
ad
valorem
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
known
but
at
least,
the
principles
that
have
the
franchise,
or
the
other
types
that
--
no
concerns
us
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
mr.
allen,
i
--
could
new
jersey
impose
an
ad
valorem
tax
against
grand
central
station
in
new
york
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
constitutionally
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
look
to
the
burden
on
commerce
in
that
case,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
this
differ?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
otherwise,
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
burden
on
commerce?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
just
ask
mr.
peterson.
this
court
say
as
i
gather
as
mr.
allen
said
the
old
fashioned
ad
valorem
property
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
that
missouri
would
not
claim
any
power
constitutionally,
the
tax
rolling
stock,
in
fact
outside
the
state
of
missouri.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
then
i
take
it
if
in
fact
a
formula
resulted
in
the
tax
of
property
outside
the
state,
you
take
the
same
position
if
constitutionally
this
could
not
be
dealt
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
really,
what
you're
coming
down
to
is
that
on
all
of
the
findings
made
by
the
tax
and
agencies
and
courts
of
your
state
concerned
with
this,
they
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
actually,
the
application
of
this
point
that
did
not
result
in
the
tax
of
any
rolling
stock
of
n&w
outside
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
don't
assess
at
full
value
at
47%
of
full
value.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that's
pretty
much
what
the
general
level
of
assessment
says
for
other
types
of
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
mr.
peterson
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
had
a
chance
really
to
study
your
(inaudible)
so
perhaps
you
will
recover
this.
now
have
we
any
information
one
of
the
states
do
that
have
ad
valorem
taxes
against
rolling
stock
in
the
way
of
allocating
rolling
stock
to
their
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
don't
bother.
i'll
get
it
from
his
brief.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
thousand
cars,
you're
referring.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
could
--
could
missouri
do
this
mr.
allen?
suppose
they
had
attributed
this
47
--
there
are
only
a
thousand
cars.
that's
wholly
taxed
in
the
hands
of
wabash.
that's
wholly
taxed
in
the
hands
of
n&w.
they
say
in
the
hands
of
the
wabash
it's
worth
47%,
in
the
hands
of
the
n&w
after
the
leasing
it's
now
worth
75%,
could
they
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
the
--
was
the
valuation
factor
in
the
hands
of
wabash
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
same
47%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
n&w
has
returned

is

then
this

then

--

did
the
n&w
have
in
