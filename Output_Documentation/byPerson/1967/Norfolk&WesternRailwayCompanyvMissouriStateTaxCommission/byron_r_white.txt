justice
byron

white
but
if
the
n&w
had
built,
had
always
owned
the
wabash,
had
always
owned
those
lines
had
built
them
and
had
built
them
up
and
was
operating
them,
had
been
operating
them
like
the
wabash
had
been,
why
n&w
always
would
have
paid
this
much
on
this
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
--
you're
--
the
premise
for
that
argument
is
that
there's
only
thousand
cars
in
missouri
which
they
were
permitted
to
--
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
missouri
and
your
proof
of
that
in
this
case
is
that
well
last
year
the
wabash
only
takes
paid
some,
only
paid
x.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
get
the
thousand
cars
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
number
of
cars
has
no
relationship
to
mileage
which
is
the
factor
they
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
say
west
virginia
or
kentucky
where
you're
carrying
coal
did
the
state
used
the
same
formula
they're
liable
to
under
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
states
that
would
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
in
a
particular
case,
the
mileage
formula,
if
that's
all
that
was
would
might
be
even
held
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
just
say
that
on
its
phase
it's
that
no
matter
what.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
today
is
also
long
past
with
saying
that
it
can't
be
counted
in
any
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
this
argument?
a
due
process
argument
or
commerce
clause
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
either,
either?
this
is
either
one
of
both
or
does
it
have
to
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
does
it
establish
the
burden
on
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
they
--
why
waive
to
prove
a
multiple
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
haven't
you
already
agreed
that
if
all
the
states
have
this
formula,
there
would
be
no
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean,
i'm
just
waiting
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
can
say
it's
a
burden
until
you've
actually
demonstrated
that
it's
a
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
not
too
destructive
to
conclude
that
your
coal
cars
and
(voice
overlap)
in
west
virginia
are
being
taxed
not
only
by
those
two
states
but
by
missouri?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
not
and
you
will.
i
gather
the
--
your
opponents
in
the
railroad
claims
that
if
you
took
the
proportion
of
the
total
value
available
of
the
rolling
stock
that
happened,
took
that
proportion
of
which
the
rolling
stock
present
on
the
certain
day
represented
of
the
total
rolling
stock,
you
had
come
out
with
x
percent
of
the
total
rolling
stock
that's
here
on
that
day
and
whereas
--
whereas
and
y
percent
of
value,
whereas
your
formula
says
there
are
three
times
that
much
by
value
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
those
are
not
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
just
goes
to
rebutting
the
point
that
you
will
be
--
that
peripheral
factor
of
the
wabash
value
the
year
before.
it
doesn't
reach
the
fundamental
premise
that
you
only
got
a
thousand
cars
in
the
state
and
that
railroads
got
3000
cars
total
and
each
car
is
worth
a
dollar.
you
got
a
thousand
dollar
worth
of
cars
in
missouri
and
the
railroad
says
that
you
end
up
showing
that
there
are
three
thousand
dollars
worth
of
cars
in
missouri.
in
the
application
of
your
formula,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
applying
your
trackage
percentage,
is
the
number
of
cars
gives
you
$3000.00
worth
of
cars
instead
of
$1000.00
worth
of
cars.
if
you
use
the
percentage
of
cars,
well
you
come
out
with
the
same
result
they
do.
you
apply
the
trackage
percentage
to
the
total
rolling
stock
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
what
the
daily
car
count
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
--
you
could
easily
come
out
if
they
have
pure
cars
per
mile
at
missouri
than
they
have
at
all
the
other
states
but
had
the
same
number
of
miles
in
missouri
as
they
have
in
all
the
other
states,
you're
going
to
come
out
taxing
cars
that
aren't
in
missouri.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can't
tax
2000
cars,
but
now
as
they
merge
with
the
wabash
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
n&w
had
built,
had
always
owned
the
wabash,
had
always
owned
those

had
built
them
and

why

you're

the

only

justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
get
the
thousand
cars
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
number
of
cars
has
no
relationship
to
mileage
which
is
the
factor
they
apply.
justice
byron

so
