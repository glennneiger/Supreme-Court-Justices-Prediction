justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
macgregor,
suppose
connecticut
the
law
and
denied
welfare
aid
to
redheaded
people,
you
think
that
has
all
the
constitutionality
and
everything
behind
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
classify,
don't
you
have
to
justify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right
but
the
state
--
once
the
state
has
classified,
the
state
has
to
justify.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
i
used
the
word
explain,
do
you
think
the
state
has
a
duty
to
explain
the
classification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
the
state
is
obliged
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that's
important
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anything
other
than
this
woman
who
came
from
massachusetts
to
connecticut
to
live
with
the
mother.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
have
anything?
do
we
have
any
expert
testimony
about
what
will
happen
with
all
these
purpose
coming
from
hawaii
and
any
place
else
to
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
read
judge
smith's
opinion
and
i
didn't
see
anything
in
there
about
any
of
this
and
that's
what's
before
us
and
not
all
of
these
other
business.
judge
smith's
opinion
is
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
technically
the
judgment
on
his
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
have
great
experiences
of
proper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
hard
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
see
the
--
except
the
one
point
that
the
state
has
a
limited
amount
of
money
as
i
assume
all
50
states
are
limited.
i
fail
to
see
any
other
grounds
for
this
classification
and
if
that
is
the
only
ground
then
that
can
be
answered
by
cutting
their
amount.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
--
i
am
agreeing
with
you
that
the
only
reason
they
have
is
that
they
don't
have
enough
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
when
you
have
the
removal
statute,
it
picked
you
back
and
took
you
back
but
now,
you
come
in
without
money.
they
tell
you
that
you
need
to
go
voluntary
or
to
stay
to
death.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
barton.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
going
to
make
the
same
argument
that
connecticut
made
that
the
government
is
too
broke,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
argument
would
you
have
made
assuming
martin
luther
kind
didn't
die
and
they
weren't
marching
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
important
to
any
debate,
any
piece
of
paper
that
says
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
government
points
out
every
core
person
that
had
been
held
less
than
a
year,
merely
because
he
was
here
less
than
a
year
without
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
public
assistance
is
controlled
by
the
equality
provisions
of
our
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
to
give
you
the
redhead
question
but
how
--
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
shows
the
reason
for
one
fencing
out
anybody
who's
been
here
less
than
a
year,
and
two,
picking
the
year
instead
of
11
months,
13
months,
two
years,
five
years
and
ten
years.
is
there
anything
deriving
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
do
you
have
to
be
a
resident
before
you
go
to
the
district?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
urge
the
position
that
where
there
is
a
classification
and
the
particular
side
that's
trying
to
get
it
declared
constitutional
is
unable
to
give
any
reason
for
it
that
in
such
a
case
we
could
take
a
look?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
is
if
it's
an
obvious
--
everybody
can
see
the
reason
for
the
classification
then
there's
no
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
do
you
go
to
the
other
end?
that's
one
end
though.
what's
the
other
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
other
end?
one
is
its
obvious,
the
other,
it's
not
obvious
or
it's
obviously
a
dead
classification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
lose
your
burden
of
showing
that
it's
an
unreasonable
classification,
didn't
i
understand
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
trying
not
to
talk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
it
helped
you,
you
want
to
be
right
on
something
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
what
the
statute
says,
you
can't
vote
unless
you
travel
here
a
year
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
it's
just
automatic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
find
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
the
law
said
that
this
is
unavailable
to
transit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
gets
back
to
who's
not
a
resident.
who
is
not
a
resident?
right.
if
a
person
is
a
resident
in
the
sense
that
he
has
come
here
with
the
present
intention
of
staying,
he
is
going
to
be
getting
his
public
assistance
checked
here
and
spending
it
here
and
he
meets
all
the
need
requirements,
i
think
that
person
is
being
discriminated
if
some
arbitrary
period
is
selected.
now,
in
terms
of
someone
who
says,
well,
i
just
arrived
in
the
district,
i'm
here
for
a
week
and
next
week,
i'm
going
to
california
where
they
have
even
more
money.
will
you
give
me
my
check
now
and
i'll
get
another
one
in
california
and
i'll
use
the
check
to
pay
my
plane
fair."
of
course,
the
state
can
buy
that
because
on
any
definition,
he
is
not
a
resident.
now,
if
i
could
just
briefly
turn
to
what
i
think
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
take
the
state's
definition
of
residence?
why
wouldn't
you
accept
the
state
law
defining
what
residence
is
for
state
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
that
you
would
accept
residence
in
the
district
of
columbia,
what
would
you
accept?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
--
any
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
defining
residence
for
any
purpose
that
you
would
accept
here
or
if
not,
what
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
why
you're
talking
about
residence
anyway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they're
physically
unable
to
go
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
you
mentioned
the
unforeseen
possibilities.
you're
not
looking
forward
to
marching
harrisburg
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like?
give
me
a
situation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
reason
i
have
here
would
be
unforeseen
covers
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
exactly.
and
pennsylvania
wouldn't
be
called
on.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pennsylvania
would
be
yelling
with
the
other
states
but
just
ask
to
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
federal
government
will
be
excused?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we're
going
to
have
to
guard
in
that
that's
went
on
proceeding.
that's
a
good
one.you've
got
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general,
what
did
you
say
the
requirement
for
voting,
90
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
it
was
giving
a
home
relief
is
more
important
than
voting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
you
wanted
the
people
to
be
a
part
of
the
community.
i
think
that
a
voter
is
the
most
important
part
of
a
citizen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
take
a
chance
on
and
let
them
vote
but
you're
not
willing
to
let
them
take
a
chance
on
accepting
your
money,
isn't
that
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
macgregor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
save
money,
within
one
year
you
say
--
how
much
does
this
increase
in
one
year
with
the
one
year
requirement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
how
much
is
the
number
of
people
increased
and
the
deficit
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
said
since
the
one
year
requirement
isn't
in
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
raise
the
rule
for
one
to
five
years?
wouldn't
that
help
you
find
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
raise
the
rule,
raise
this
requirement
from
one
to
five,
wouldn't
that
help
you
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
why
shouldn't
connecticut
since
all
your
interest
is
in
this
money,
why
don't
you
raise
it
from
one
to
five?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
been
talking
about
it.
you
said
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
my
other
question
is
that
do
you
think
that
they
can
just
not
eat
for
a
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
--
i
assume
she's
been
eating
if
she
was
still
alive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
only
reason
is
that
one,
you
don't
have
enough
money
and
two,
you
want
to
save
what
you
have
so
that's
the
reason
for
the
one
year
requirement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
one
year
requirement,
if
a
man
spends
22
hours
a
day
looking
for
a
job,
he
still
wouldn't
get
anything
for
a
year
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
unless
he
got
a
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
one
--
maybe
is
this
one
state
in
the
union
with
no
unemployment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
soon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
one-armed
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
one-armed
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
man
with
one
arm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wanted
to
indicate
that
connecticut
is
one
of
the
few
states
in
the
union
that
has
no
unemployment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
have
to
show
that
one
year
is
just
the
right
figure
to
prevent
fraud?
justice
thurgood
marshall
perhaps
one-month.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
the
other
point
to
have
about
saving
money
a
proper
argument
to
be
made
concerning
the
government
of
the
most
affluent
nation
in
the
world
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
note
that
this
government
is
unable
to
pay
people
enough
money
so
they
can
eat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean,
do
you
think
we
should
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
the
only
choice
you
have
was
to
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
others
were
getting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
find
the
source
of
congress
right
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
right
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
do
you
go
find
the
source?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
since
you've
mentioned
the
requirements
for
voting,
is
it
still
true
in
pennsylvania
that
the
residence
requirement
for
voting
is
less
than
for
welfare?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
it
was
the
opposite
the
last
time
you
were
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
ten
states
do
not
have
it
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
ten
do
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
perfectly
legal,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
we
say
that
the
other
40
are
in
the
same
category
of
the
ten,
we
don't
have
to
touch
the
statute,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
doesn't
require
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
statute
require
it,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
position
that
the
federal
statute
requires
you
to
have
a
one
year
residency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
do
we
have
to
get
to
the
statute
and
so
far
as
pennsylvania
statute
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
administrator
right
now.
i'm
talking
about
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
cannot
this
court
say
that
the
statute
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
falls,
therefore
you
may
not
put
in
one
year
requirement?
you
may
put
in
a
legitimate
requirement
for
establishing
residency.
they're
not
--
and
i
don't
even
see
why
we
have
to
even
mention
the
federal
statute
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania's
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
hold
this
welfare
statute
unconstitutional
and
still
leave
the
other
one.
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
macgregor,
suppose
connecticut
the
law
and
denied
welfare
aid
to
redheaded
people,
you
think
that
has
all
the
constitutionality
and
everything
behind
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
classify,
don't
you
have
to
justify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right
but
the
state
--
once
the
state
has
classified,
the
state
has
to
justify.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
i
used

do
you

long
do
you
have
to
be
a
resident
before
you
go
to
the
district?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
urge
the
position
that
where
there
is
a
classification
and
the
particular
side
that's
trying
to
get
it
declared
constitutional
is
unable
to
give
any
reason
for
it
that
in
such
a
case
we
could
take
a
look?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
is
if
it's
an
obvious
--
everybody
can
see
the
reason
for
the
classification
then
there's
no
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
do
you
go
to
the
other
end?
that's
one
end
though.
what's
the
other
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
other
end?
one
is
its
obvious,
the
other,
it's
not
obvious
or
it's
obviously
a
dead
classification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
lose
your
burden
of
showing
that
it's
an
unreasonable
classification,
didn't
i
understand
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
trying
not
to
talk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
it
helped
you,
you
want
to
be
right
on
something
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
what
the
statute
says,
you
can't
vote
unless
you
travel
here
a
year
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
it's
just
automatic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
find
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
the
law
said
that
this
is
unavailable
to
transit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
gets
back
to
who's
not
a
resident.
who
is
not
a
resident?
right.
if
a
person
is
a
resident
in
the
sense
that
he
has
come
here
with
the
present
intention
of
staying,
he
is
going
to
be
getting
his
public
assistance
checked
here
and
spending
it
here
and
he
meets
all
the
need
requirements,
i
think
that
person
is
being
discriminated
if
some
arbitrary
period
is
selected.
now,
in
terms
of
someone
who
says,
well,
i
just
arrived
in
the
district,
i'm
here
for
a
week
and
next
week,
i'm
going
to
california
where
they
have
even
more
money.
will
you
give
me
my
check
now
and
i'll
get
another
one
in
california
and
i'll
use
the
check
to
pay
my
plane
fair."
of
course,
the
state
can
buy
that
because
on
any
definition,
he
is
not
a
resident.
now,
if
i
could
just
briefly
turn
to
what
i
think
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
take
the
state's
definition
of
residence?
why
wouldn't
you
accept
the
state
law
defining
what
residence
is
for
state
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
that
you
would
accept
residence
in
the
district
of
columbia,
what
would
you
accept?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
--
any
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
defining
residence
for
any
purpose
that
you
would
accept
here
or
if
not,
what
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
why
you're
talking
about
residence
anyway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they're
physically
unable
to
go
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
you
mentioned
the
unforeseen
possibilities.
you're
not
looking
forward
to
marching
harrisburg
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like?
give
me
a
situation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
reason
i
have
here
would
be
unforeseen
covers
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
exactly.
and
pennsylvania
wouldn't
be
called
on.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pennsylvania
would
be
yelling
with
the
other
states
but
just
ask
to
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
federal
government
will
be
excused?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we're
going
to
have
to
guard
in
that
that's
went
on
proceeding.
that's
a
good
one.you've
got
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general,
what
did
you
say
the
requirement
for
voting,
90
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
it
was
giving
a
home
relief
is
more
important
than
voting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
you
wanted
the
people
to
be
a
part
of
the
community.
i
think
that
a
voter
is
the
most
important
part
of
a
citizen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
take
a
chance
on
and
let
them
vote
but
you're
not
willing
to
let
them
take
a
chance
on
accepting
your
money,
isn't
that
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
macgregor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
save
money,
within
one
year
you
say
--
how
much
does
this
increase
in
one
year
with
the
one
year
requirement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
how
much
is
the
number
of
people
increased
and
the
deficit
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
said
since
the
one
year
requirement
isn't
in
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
raise
the
rule
for
one
to
five
years?
wouldn't
that
help
you
find
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
raise
the
rule,
raise
this
requirement
from
one
to
five,
wouldn't
that
help
you
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
why
shouldn't
connecticut
since
all
your
interest
is
in
this
money,
why
don't
you
raise
it
from
one
to
five?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
been
talking
about
it.
you
said
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
my
other
question
is
that
do
you
think
that
they
can
just
not
eat
for
a
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
--
i
assume
she's
been
eating
if
she
was
still
alive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
only
reason
is
that
one,
you
don't
have
enough
money
and
two,
you
want
to
save
what
you
have
so
that's
the
reason
for
the
one
year
requirement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
one
year
requirement,
if
a
man
spends
22
hours
a
day
looking
for
a
job,
he
still
wouldn't
get
anything
for
a
year
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
unless
he
got
a
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
one
--
maybe
is
this
one
state
in
the
union
with
no
unemployment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
soon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
one-armed
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
one-armed
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
man
with
one
arm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wanted
to
indicate
that
connecticut
is
one
of
the
few
states
in
the
union
that
has
no
unemployment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
have
to
show
that
one
year
is
just
the
right
figure
to
prevent
fraud?
justice
thurgood
marshall
perhaps
one-month.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
the
other
point
to
have
about
saving
money
a
proper
argument
to
be
made
concerning
the
government
of
the
most
affluent
nation
in
the
world
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
note
that
this
government
is
unable
to
pay
people
enough
money
so
they
can
eat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean,
do
you
think
we
should
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
the
only
choice
you
have
was
to
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
others
were
getting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
find
the
source
of
congress
right
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
right
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
do
you
go
find
the
source?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
since
you've
mentioned
the
requirements
for
voting,
is
it
still
true
in
pennsylvania
that
the
residence
requirement
for
voting
is
less
than
for
welfare?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
it
was
the
opposite
the
last
time
you
were
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
ten
states
do
not
have
it
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
ten
do
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
perfectly
legal,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
we
say
that
the
other
40
are
in
the
same
category
of
the
ten,
we
don't
have
to
touch
the
statute,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
doesn't
require
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
statute
require
it,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
position
that
the
federal
statute
requires
you
to
have
a
one
year
residency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
do
we
have
to
get
to
the
statute
and
so
far
as
pennsylvania
statute
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
administrator
right
now.
i'm
talking
about
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
cannot
this
court
say
that
the
statute
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
falls,
therefore
you
may
not
put
in
one
year
requirement?
you
may
put
in
a
legitimate
requirement
for
establishing
residency.
they're
not
--
and
i
don't
even
see
why
we
have
to
even
mention
the
federal
statute
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania's
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
hold
this
welfare
statute
unconstitutional
and
still
leave
the
other
one.
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
it?
