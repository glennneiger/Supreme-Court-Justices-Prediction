is

it
was
not
hard
--
chief

but
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
on
the
right
to
vote
wherever
one
happens
to
be
there
is
no
distinction
or
as
between
people
who
were
temporarily
in

and
the
ones
who
have
lived
there
for
long
time
so
far
as
voting
for
president
in
the

is
concerned.
chief

earl

does
that
mean
that
they
could
have
the
discrimination
and
invidious
limitations
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
that
section
in
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
stressed
in
your
argument
on
the
fact
that
this
is
discrimination
because
they
don't
like
people
and
because
they're
--
they're
not
of
their
own
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
would
be
one
of
the

that
you
take
the

california,
arizona,
some
of
the
western

you
will

the

now
in

with
california,
when
i
came
here
15

the

had
12

it
has
20

people
today
and
there
has
been
an
influx
of
people
at
the
rate
of
1,500
a

presumably
for
permanent
residence
ever
since
the
day
i
left.
chief
justice
earl
warren
although
they're
not
all
indigents.
i
--
i
don't
suggest
that
but
most
of
them
come
looking
for
jobs
and
they
don't
have
jobs
when
they
come.
chief
