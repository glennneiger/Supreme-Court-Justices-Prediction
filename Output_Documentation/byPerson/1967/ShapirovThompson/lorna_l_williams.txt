ms.
lorna
l.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
justices
of
the
court
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
glad
that
my
associate
in
this
case
is
the
main
counsel
of
course,
didn't
hang
his
head
entirely
on
the
redheaded
matter
because
i
think
that
would
be
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
but
that
isn't
this
particular
kind
of
case.
i'm
also
glad
the
he
didn't
hang
his
head
entirely
on
the
economic
problem
although
that
is
one
of
the
things
that's
involved
but
there
are
other
considerations
before
this
court
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
whole
fundamental
reason
and
purpose
of
aid
of
dependency
law.
it
stand
the
course
from
the
federal
government
prior
to
the
social
security
act
in
which
this
particular
law
was
available
to
states
who
could
qualify
or
willing
to
qualify
the
matter
of
welfare
and
helping
the
poor
was
on
the
conscience
of
those
people
in
their
local
communities
under
the
police
powers
though
that
type
of
help
still
continues
in
iowa
and
i'm
sure
it
does
in
the
other
states.
during
this
period
of
time
while
residency
is
being
established
for
adc,
i
took
that
time
in
my
appendix
to
show
the
court
those
particular
laws.
the
board
of
supervisors
provide
that
kind
of
help
for
the
indigent
whether
or
not
there
are
minor
children
involved
who
haven't
lived
in
the
state
for
a
year
or
not.
the
--
i
mean
i
read
yesterday
really
quickly,
the
briefs
of
a
legal
age
societies
and
the
church
groups,
my
heart
really
was
touched
as
i'm
sure
this
court
says
that
this
particular
program
does
not
cover
every
type
of
situation
nor
was
it
designed
to
cover
every
type
of
situation.
it
was
designed
to
cover
a
place
where
the
children
could
be
brought
up
as
our
children
are
brought
up
in
a
community
where
instead
of
just
bread
and
butter
money
and
milk
money,
they
have
some
professional
legal
counseling
which
our
federal
government
provides
funds
for,
our
state,
the
government
provides
some
funds
for.
and
we
do
this
to
the
people
who
have
shown
that
they
really
want
to
be
a
resident
of
our
states
and
how
do
they
intend,
how
do
they
show
that
intention?
up
to
the
time
of
a
year,
they
have
--
they
are
in
dire
need
of
welfare,
they
are
as
i
said
on
the
police
powers
taken
care
of
by
the
states.
but
if
they
show
that
they
really
want
to
be
--
live
in
that
state,
make
it
their
home
which
they
have
a
right
to
do,
then,
they
can
qualify
because
of
that
one
year
residency
for
aid
to
dependent
children
if
otherwise
qualified.
therefore,
i'm
glad
co-counsel
said
there
are
other
considerations
besides
economic.
this
is
an
overall
program
where
the
children
are
tied
to
a
community
where
the
people
care
about
them,
where
we
are
more
or
less
tied
because
of
our
occupations
in
rearing
our
children.
we
are
not
free
because
of
law
of
business
in
my
case
and
other
jobs,
the
machinist
and
seniority
rights
and
the
factory
workers
to
move
freely
from
state
to
state
when
they
have
young
children
to
support.
they're
more
or
less
tied
because
that's
what
they
want
to
give
to
their
children
for
security.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
yes,
they
do,
your
honor
and
one
reason
that
we
are
here
are
at
the
moment,
i'm
defending
a
constitutionality
in
the
northern
district
of
iowa
district
court,
federal
district
court
on
the
residency
of
old
age
assistance.
also
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
don't
think
we
do
on
aid
of
dependent,
aid
of
the
blind
or
aid
--
i
can't
say
for
sure
your
honor
but
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
because
in
our
state,
our
welfare
laws
are
driven
by
apathy.
first
there
was
only
the
assistance
before
there
was
any
social
security
law
in
a
federal
basis
and
that
was
revamped
to
meet
the
federal
requirements.
the
aid
to
dependent
children
law
came
in
many
years
later.
before
that
time,
they
were
just
dependent
upon
having
local
relief
under
the
police
powers
of
the
state.
but
the
hour
at
the
moment
is
second
highest
in
the
amount
of
money
paid
to
these
children.
you
see,
when
this
federal
law
was
passed,
it
was
saying
to
the
states
such
as
iowa
who
is
depending
on
local
relief
to
help
the
people.
if
you
folk
want
to
help
children
to
live
in
your
community
and
become
an
integrated
part
in
residence
there
and
they
show
that
they
want
to
be
residents
by
being
there
a
year
and
if
you
will,
if
you
will
do
these
other
things,
we
will
match
the
money,
we
will
match
your
money
at
50/50.
in
iowa,
it
comes
right
from
one-fourth
of
that
50%
provided
by
the
state,
comes
right
from
the
county
where
the
people
are
residents
from
local
taxes.
the
other
one-fourth
comes
from
general
appropriations
by
the
legislature.
if
this
court
were
to
strike
down
this
law,
you
would
not
your
honors
be
helping
the
other
people
for
whom
this
law
was
designed
because
our
legislature
considers
the
people
by
case
load
past
experience
in
determining
what
they're
asking
for
the
legislature
is
going
to
be
and
when
the
legislature
meets
and
on
a
long
projected
basis
as
a
family
plans
for
its
purchases
over
the
few
years
to
come
as
a
corporation
plans
for
few
years
to
come
as
a
state
must
plan
for
a
few
years
to
come,
what
the
needs
are
going
to
be
so
that
they
know
how
much
money
they'll
be
able
to
afford,
there
is
just
so
many
people
included
in
that
give
or
take
level,
there's
a
little
margin
but
in
iowa,
even
when
those
girls
move
to
another
state
because
they
were
in
that
appropriation
in
that
projected
calculation
for
one
year
if
they
need
it.
in
another
state
in
the
code
of
connecticut
and
before
they
qualify
in
connecticut
or
wherever
they
will
have
a
residency
law,
iowa
continues
to
pay
and
iowa
is
second
from
the
top
in
the
payments.
and
we
continue
to
pay,
therefore
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
in
connecticut
your
honor,
you
mean
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
oh
yes.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
no,
she
didn't
your
honor.
but
connecticut
is
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
true
and
we
only
have
so
much
money.
so
if
this
court
would
strike
this
down
as
not
being
constitutional,
everyone
of
our
women
who
are
planning
to
keep
their
children
on
a
certain
standard
of
living,
they
have
to
drop
a
course
because
it
is
equal
to
everyone
whether
they
come
in
their
role
as
new,
whether
they'd
been
there
ten
years
as
long
as
they
need
the
money,
they
share
equally.
no
discrimination.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
probably
fiscal
but
also,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
social
security
law
because
now,
i'm
going
back
to
the
congress.
the
congress
said
to
the
states,
we
will
match
your
funds
and
you
may
have
one
year
residency
law
which
proves
the
intention
of
this
people
you
are
intending
to
help.
we
are
giving
these
children
some
security
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
in
my
judgment
your
honor,
these
people
have
equal
protection
of
the
law.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
we
are,
before
this
court
on
this
constitutional
law
questions.
the
welfare
briefs
filed
by
the
welfare
department
in
one
of
the
heart
rendering,
it's
not
a
question
of
poverty.
again,
this
isn't
intended
to
cover
all
poverty.
we
get
right
back
to
the
constitutional
law
of
questions
and
these
are
the
three
fundamental
ones
as
i
view
them.
one,
can
there
be
reasonable
classifications
and
is
this
reasonable?
it's
reasonable
because
it
affords
the
ones
who
want
to
have
a
sort
of
permanency
in
that
community
and
have
the
professionally
hired
counselor
come
into
their
homes
and
help
them
on
their
family
problems.
if
the
kids
need
some
dentistry,
they
can
talk
with
them
about
that
and
of
course
money
is
forth
coming.
if
they're
having
trouble
in
school,
they're
retarded,
many
times
in
my
private
practice
attorney
for
the
state,
divorce
matters.
they
work
with
these
people.
they
help
them.
they
consult
with
them.
they
have
a
friend
in
the
community
besides
just
bread
and
butter
money
coming
from
that.
it
is
tied
to
helping
people.
it's
a
reasonable
classification
to
help
the
children.
it's
not
aid
to
dependent
parents,
it's
aid
to
dependent
children.
the
parents
qualify
if
in
connecticut,
they
didn't
qualify
sooner
than
one
year
in
fact,
if
the
parents
want
to
work
and
they're
able
to
work.
many
of
us
mothers
work
and
our
children
will
take
care
of
their
grandparents
or
neighbors.
so
the
work
incentive
program
which
the
congress
has
now
passed
will
be
before
this
court
soon,
sure
enough.
i
imagined
that
someone
is
going
to
say
that
constitutional
right
are
infringed
upon
because
they
can't
get
welfare
because
they
want
to
not
work.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
the
other
one
is
brought
out
already.
on
this
budget
proposition
on
long
range
planning,
it's
necessary
to
have
that
and
the
other
--
the
third
when
moral
is
tied
with
that
also
because
it's
not
the
judiciary
that
says
how
much
appropriations
are
going
to
be
made.
in
fact,
the
states
--there's
no
obligation
on
the
states
to
make
--
to
go
in
to
this
plan
under
adc.
they
want
to
do
it
because
they
can
help
their
local
citizens
to
a
greater
extent.
so
those
are
my
three.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
justices
of
the
court
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
glad
that
my
associate
in
this
case
is
the
main
counsel
of
course,
didn't
hang
his
head
entirely
on
the
redheaded
matter
because
i
think
that
would
be
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
but
that
isn't
this
particular
kind
of
case.
i'm
also
glad
the
he
didn't
hang
his
head
entirely
on
the
economic
problem
although
that
is
one
of
the
things
that's
involved
but
there
are
other
considerations
before
this
court
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
whole
fundamental
reason
and
purpose
of
aid
of
dependency
law.
it
stand
the
course
from
the
federal
government
prior
to
the
social
security
act
in
which
this
particular
law
was
available
to
states
who
could
qualify
or
willing
to
qualify
the
matter
of
welfare
and
helping
the
poor
was
on
the
conscience
of
those
people
in
their
local
communities
under
the
police
powers
though
that
type
of
help
still
continues
in
iowa
and
i'm
sure
it
does
in
the
other
states.
during
this
period
of
time
while
residency
is
being
established
for
adc,
i
took
that
time
in
my
appendix
to
show
the
court
those
particular
laws.
the
board
of
supervisors
provide
that
kind
of
help
for
the
indigent
whether
or
not
there
are
minor
children
involved
who
haven't
lived
in
the
state
for
a
year
or
not.
the
--
i
mean
i
read
yesterday
really
quickly,
the
briefs
of
a
legal
age
societies
and
the
church
groups,
my
heart
really
was
touched
as
i'm
sure
this
court
says
that
this
particular
program
does
not
cover
every
type
of
situation
nor
was
it
designed
to
cover
every
type
of
situation.
it
was
designed
to
cover
a
place
where
the
children
could
be
brought
up
as
our
children
are
brought
up
in
a
community
where
instead
of
just
bread
and
butter
money
and
milk
money,
they
have
some
professional
legal
counseling
which
our
federal
government
provides
funds
for,
our
state,
the
government
provides
some
funds
for.
and
we
do
this
to
the
people
who
have
shown
that
they
really
want
to
be
a
resident
of
our
states
and
how
do
they
intend,
how
do
they
show
that
intention?
up
to
the
time
of
a
year,
they
have
--
they
are
in
dire
need
of
welfare,
they
are
as
i
said
on
the
police
powers
taken
care
of
by
the
states.
but
if
they
show
that
they
really
want
to
be
--
live
in
that
state,
make
it
their
home
which
they
have
a
right
to
do,
then,
they
can
qualify
because
of
that
one
year
residency
for
aid
to
dependent
children
if
otherwise
qualified.
therefore,
i'm
glad
co-counsel
said
there
are
other
considerations
besides
economic.
this
is
an
overall
program
where
the
children
are
tied
to
a
community
where
the
people
care
about
them,
where
we
are
more
or
less
tied
because
of
our
occupations
in
rearing
our
children.
we
are
not
free
because
of
law
of
business
in
my
case
and
other
jobs,
the
machinist
and
seniority
rights
and
the
factory
workers
to
move
freely
from
state
to
state
when
they
have
young
children
to
support.
they're
more
or
less
tied
because
that's
what
they
want
to
give
to
their
children
for
security.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
yes,
they
do,
your
honor
and
one
reason
that
we
are
here
are
at
the
moment,
i'm
defending
a
constitutionality
in
the
northern
district
of
iowa
district
court,
federal
district
court
on
the
residency
of
old
age
assistance.
also
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
don't
think
we
do
on
aid
of
dependent,
aid
of
the
blind
or
aid
--
i
can't
say
for
sure
your
honor
but
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
because
in
our
state,
our
welfare
laws
are
driven
by
apathy.
first
there
was
only
the
assistance
before
there
was
any
social
security
law
in
a
federal
basis
and
that
was
revamped
to
meet
the
federal
requirements.
the
aid
to
dependent
children
law
came
in
many
years
later.
before
that
time,
they
were
just
dependent
upon
having
local
relief
under
the
police
powers
of
the
state.
but
the
hour
at
the
moment
is
second
highest
in
the
amount
of
money
paid
to
these
children.
you
see,
when
this
federal
law
was
passed,
it
was
saying
to
the
states
such
as
iowa
who
is
depending
on
local
relief
to
help
the
people.
if
you
folk
want
to
help
children
to
live
in
your
community
and
become
an
integrated
part
in
residence
there
and
they
show
that
they
want
to
be
residents
by
being
there
a
year
and
if
you
will,
if
you
will
do
these
other
things,
we
will
match
the
money,
we
will
match
your
money
at
50/50.
in
iowa,
it
comes
right
from
one-fourth
of
that
50%
provided
by
the
state,
comes
right
from
the
county
where
the
people
are
residents
from
local
taxes.
the
other
one-fourth
comes
from
general
appropriations
by
the
legislature.
if
this
court
were
to
strike
down
this
law,
you
would
not
your
honors
be
helping
the
other
people
for
whom
this
law
was
designed
because
our
legislature
considers
the
people
by
case
load
past
experience
in
determining
what
they're
asking
for
the
legislature
is
going
to
be
and
when
the
legislature
meets
and
on
a
long
projected
basis
as
a
family
plans
for
its
purchases
over
the
few
years
to
come
as
a
corporation
plans
for
few
years
to
come
as
a
state
must
plan
for
a
few
years
to
come,
what
the
needs
are
going
to
be
so
that
they
know
how
much
money
they'll
be
able
to
afford,
there
is
just
so
many
people
included
in
that
give
or
take
level,
there's
a
little
margin
but
in
iowa,
even
when
those
girls
move
to
another
state
because
they
were
in
that
appropriation
in
that
projected
calculation
for
one
year
if
they
need
it.
in
another
state
in
the
code
of
connecticut
and
before
they
qualify
in
connecticut
or
wherever
they
will
have
a
residency
law,
iowa
continues
to
pay
and
iowa
is
second
from
the
top
in
the
payments.
and
we
continue
to
pay,
therefore
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
in
connecticut
your
honor,
you
mean
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
oh
yes.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
no,
she
didn't
your
honor.
but
connecticut
is
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
true
and
we
only
have
so
much
money.
so
if
this
court
would
strike
this
down
as
not
being
constitutional,
everyone
of
our
women
who
are
planning
to
keep
their
children
on
a
certain
standard
of
living,
they
have
to
drop
a
course
because
it
is
equal
to
everyone
whether
they
come
in
their
role
as
new,
whether
they'd
been
there
ten
years
as
long
as
they
need
the
money,
they
share
equally.
no
discrimination.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
probably
fiscal
but
also,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
social
security
law
because
now,
i'm
going
back
to
the
congress.
the
congress
said
to
the
states,
we
will
match
your
funds
and
you
may
have
one
year
residency
law
which
proves
the
intention
of
this
people
you
are
intending
to
help.
we
are
giving
these
children
some
security
--
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
in
my
judgment
your
honor,
these
people
have
equal
protection
of
the
law.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
we
are,
before
this
court
on
this
constitutional
law
questions.
the
welfare
briefs
filed
by
the
welfare
department
in
one
of
the
heart
rendering,
it's
not
a
question
of
poverty.
again,
this
isn't
intended
to
cover
all
poverty.
we
get
right
back
to
the
constitutional
law
of
questions
and
these
are
the
three
fundamental
ones
as
i
view
them.
one,
can
there
be
reasonable
classifications
and
is
this
reasonable?
it's
reasonable
because
it
affords
the
ones
who
want
to
have
a
sort
of
permanency
in
that
community
and
have
the
professionally
hired
counselor
come
into
their
homes
and
help
them
on
their
family
problems.
if
the
kids
need
some
dentistry,
they
can
talk
with
them
about
that
and
of
course
money
is
forth
coming.
if
they're
having
trouble
in
school,
they're
retarded,
many
times
in
my
private
practice
attorney
for
the
state,
divorce
matters.
they
work
with
these
people.
they
help
them.
they
consult
with
them.
they
have
a
friend
in
the
community
besides
just
bread
and
butter
money
coming
from
that.
it
is
tied
to
helping
people.
it's
a
reasonable
classification
to
help
the
children.
it's
not
aid
to
dependent
parents,
it's
aid
to
dependent
children.
the
parents
qualify
if
in
connecticut,
they
didn't
qualify
sooner
than
one
year
in
fact,
if
the
parents
want
to
work
and
they're
able
to
work.
many
of
us
mothers
work
and
our
children
will
take
care
of
their
grandparents
or
neighbors.
so
the
work
incentive
program
which
the
congress
has
now
passed
will
be
before
this
court
soon,
sure
enough.
i
imagined
that
someone
is
going
to
say
that
constitutional
right
are
infringed
upon
because
they
can't
get
welfare
because
they
want
to
not
work.
ms.
lorna
l.
williams
the
other
one
is
brought
out
already.
on
this
budget
proposition
on
long
range
planning,
it's
necessary
to
have
that
and
the
other
--
the
third
when
moral
is
tied
with
that
also
because
it's
not
the
judiciary
that
says
how
much
appropriations
are
going
to
be
made.
in
fact,
the
states
--there's
no
obligation
on
the
states
to
make
--
to
go
in
to
this
plan
under
adc.
they
want
to
do
it
because
they
can
help
their
local
citizens
to
a
greater
extent.
so
those
are
my
three.
