justice
potter
stewart
now,
massachusetts
didn't
continue
to
pay
in
this
case,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
appellee
did
not
--
ms.
thompson
--mrs.
thompson
did
not
continue
to
be
eligible
for
relief
from
massachusetts
in
this
case,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
after
she
came
to
connecticut.
justice
potter
stewart
did
she
remain
eligible
for
relief
in
that
system?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
telling
us
that
if
she
had
come
from
iowa,
she
would
have
remained
eligible
for
help
from
iowa
for
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one.
you
said
there
were
three.
what
are
the
other
two?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
voting
in
connecticut
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
simply
asking
what
the
connecticut
law
is
about
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
so
at
least
for
some
other
purposes,
connecticut
defines
--
it
qualifies
the
people
a
little
different
from
domicile
from
simply
a
presence
there
with
an
intent
to
remain
there
indefinitely.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
difference
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
told
that
somebody
who
leaves
massachusetts
loses
his
eligibility
for
any
help
from
massachusetts
immediately.
at
least
that's
what
i
understood
the
question.how
about
somebody
who
leaves
connecticut
after
having
been
eligible
in
connecticut?
does
connecticut
--
decided
somebody
who
live
for
awhile.
justice
potter
stewart
neither
to
connecticut
or
massachusetts.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
cases
arising
under
the
equal
protection
clause
before?
justice
potter
stewart
this
of
course
does
not
directly
apply
to
this
case
except
through
bolling
against
sharpe.
justice
potter
stewart
there
might
be
countless
reasons
of
why
a
statute
might
unconstitutional
or
at
least
could
be
attacked
as
constitutional,
one
that
had
violated
the
right
to
free
speech,
violated
the
establishment
clause,
another
that
it
was
a
bill
of
attainder
and
other
that
it
was
beyond
the
article
i,
power
of
congress
to
an
act.
surely,
you're
not
just
talking
in
gross
about
the
constitutionality
down
under
the
law
passed
by
a
congress
or
a
state?
are
you
confining
yourself
to
attacks
--
to
questions
arising
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
that
it's
not
a
first
amendment
case.
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
against
private
interference.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
say
anything
about
the
right
to
travel
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
your
right
to
travel
or
the
extent
of
the
infringement?
justice
potter
stewart
do
--
do
you
think
the
right
to
travel
doctrine
is
a
limitation
on
the
commerce
power?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
how
about
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
mr.
cox,
a
subject
to
the
right
of
each
state
to
take
a
reasonable
time
to
authenticate
the
bona
fide
residence
in
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the--
and
the
means
test
and
the
various
other
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
sort
of
consideration
might
ever
be
a
constitutional
basis
for
resident
requirement
for
other
purposes?
i
suppose
in
thinking
about
this
case,
you
have
thought
about
the
impact
of
the
decision
that
you
urge
upon
other
state
residence
requirements
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
thought
that
that
was
at
least
of
the
supports
purportedly
asserted
about
forward
for
voting
residence
requirements,
a
knowledge
of
the
community
and
knowledge
of
the
people
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
knowledge
of
these
problems
in
an
investment
in
the
community
and
a
knowledge
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
goes
to
your
--
for
the
very
first
point
you've
made
that
this
is
very
basic
to
life
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
did
you
say
for
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
i
saw
somewhere,
a
figure
of
400
applications
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
not
important
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
figures
in
your
brief
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
have
you
really
thought
that
through?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
on
the
top
of
page
32
of
your
brief
and
i
must
confess
i
was
quite
shocked
when
i
read
that
sentence.
i'm
not
emotionally
shocked
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
would
have
extraordinarily
difficult
constitutional
problems
involved
in
it,
the
same
kind
of
equal
protection
problems.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
massachusetts
didn't
continue
to
pay
in
this
case,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this

--
ms.
thompson
--mrs.

did
not
continue
to
be
eligible
for
relief
from
massachusetts
in
this
case,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
after
she
came
to
connecticut.
justice
potter
stewart
did
she
remain
eligible
for
relief
in
that
system?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
telling
us
that
if
she
had
come
from
iowa,
she
