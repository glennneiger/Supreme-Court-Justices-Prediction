ms.
lorna
lawhead

may
it
please
the
court.
since
we
were
here
in
may,
there
have
been
some
further
developments
along
the
lines
about
which
we
are
concern
again
today.
first,
we
have
had
three
further
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
all
in
the
nature
of
the
same
as
filed
by
legal
aid
societies
and
oeo
attorneys
that
were
here
before
and
again
they
point
out
that
there
is
a
need,
and
we
all
are
aware
there
is
a
need,
for
people
who
are
suffering
and
are
in
law
in
our
country.
but
this
is
still
not
sufficient
reason
to
overlook
the
fact
that
this
particular
adc
program
is
tied
to
the
residency
of
people
within
a
state.
the
states
have
the
local
authority,
the
local
legislation,
the
local
administrative
power
to
administer
the
program
within
their
jurisdiction.
they
can
call
upon
the
federal
government
for
additional
matching
funds
of
certain
proportions,
if
they
can
qualify
by
their
laws
to
carry
out
the
--
the
provisions
of
a
federal
law
setting
up
what
they
call,
state
plans.
so,
i
again
mentioned
as
i
did
before
that
in
spite
of
the
three
briefs
now
filed
by
the
people
or
your
legal
aid,
the
problem
is
still
before
us,
it
is
a
legislative
problem
and
not
a
judicial
problem.
the
forum
is
still
wrong.
there
does
have
been
some
other
developments.
the
congress
and
its
provisions
603
of
the
social
security
act
provides
in
there
that
--
and
this
is
before
the
amendment
which
we
spoke
of
briefly
last
time,
but
now
it's
enforcing
iowa
and
in
some
of
the
other
states
called
the
wind
program,
working
set
of
program.
it's
now
being
operated
in
the
states.
it
has
to
be
operated
by
july
1
of
'69
as
to
all
three
phases
or
no
state
can
qualify
any
longer
for
matching
funds.
but
the
--
the
original
act
itself
in
603
bids
and
reads
this
--
reads
this
way,
“whom
children
or
applicants
or
recipients
of
aided
family
with
dependent
children
are
living
to
attain
or
retain
capabilities
for
self
support
or
self
care
which
are
prescribed
by
the
secretary.”
in
other
words,
the
goal
isn't
to
dangle
welfare
in
front
of
people
as
the
ultimate
goal.
the
goal
is
to
help
people
to
earn
their
living
by
their
own
hard
labors,
teach
them,
give
them
training,
on
the
job
training,
vocational
training,
help
them
through
their
local
employment
services
to
take
a
job
immediately.
so
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
yes.
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
i
think
that's
our
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
i
think
that
is
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
i
think
that's
arbitrary
and
i
think
that
wouldn't
tie
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
i'm
afraid
so,
your
honor.
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
i
believe
it
would
but
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
man
with
one
arm.
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
the
two
things
you
pose
are
not
the
same,
your
honor.
one
is
a
point
of
when
it
ties
in
some
other
element
but
once
the
classification
is
made
by
a
state
or
a
congress.
once
the
classification
is
made
and
there's
great
latitude
in
this
type
of
thing
since
it's
not
a
commander
or
directive
on
congress
in
order
the
states
to
make
under
amendment
one
rights
then
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
reason
that
we
would
know
within
one
year
who
wants
to
contribute,
who
do
--
who
are
our
people,
who
wants
to
live
here,
contribute
and
we
want
to
help.
it's
for
the
good
of
our
state,
for
iowa
when
we
can
help
the
ones
around
us
under
our
police
powers
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
this
is
correct.
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
program
for
residents.
it
isn't
for
transients
that
we
have
to
depend
on
other
welfare
agencies,
other
welfare
laws
to
take
care
of
that
problem.
this
is
the
one
that
we
are
ours.
we
want
them
to
feel
like
they
belong
to
us.we
want
them
to
join
our
labor
market.this
wind
program
is
a
very,
very
important
program.
iowa
just
--
just
--
as
of
october
1st
the
monies
are
awaiting,
the
employment
agency
is
ready,
the
people
on
this
program
on
adc
now
are
ready
to
go
into
these
jobs
and
learn
on
the
job
training.
and
we
are
going
to
offer
them
so
much
more
through
this
whole
program.
but
this
isn't
a
program
that
you
can
offer
to
someone
coming
in
and
then
living
within
a
few
weeks
or
so.
it
is
a
program
designed
for
permanency,
for
the
people
who
are
going
to
live
there,
work
there,
be
in
our
schools,
give
there
references
for
their
--
when
they
go
from
job
to
job,
make
a
change
in
jobs,
right
within
their
own
local
communities
where
we
can
keep
track
of
them
and
they
can
help
us,
we
can
help
them.
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
no,
your
honor.
but
we're
not
in
that
problem.
the
problem
of
personal
liberties
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
exactly,
(inaudible)
one
is
a
man
with
one
arm,
or
a
man
with
one
right,
the
other
one
is
not.
ms.
lorna
lawhead

fire
protection
of
the

ms.
lorna
lawhead

i
think
that
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead

i
would
think
that
everything
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead

--
that
we
as
people
have
as
our
personal
liberties
are
in
one
category
and
have
to
be
maintained
and
retained
by
state
law,
federal
law,
by
all
the
people.
but
when
we
talk
about
our
right,
if
it
is
a
right
or
privilege
or
benefit
where
there
it's
just
as
gratuity
because
we
in
our
hearts
want
to
do
it,
we
make
the
classification
which
must
be
reasonable.
we
make
the
classification
for
the
purpose
of
helping
them
in
our
particular
plan,
it
isn't
intended
to
encompass
everyone.
the
no
government
--
no
state
as
wealthy
as
iowa
as
with
its
farmlands
and
is
not
too
wealthy
or
high
on
all
of
this.
first
on
disabled,
second
on
old
age
assistance
and
by
the
way,
when
i
was
here
before,
i
know
i
have
argued
that
case
to
the
three
judge
court
in
the
northern
district
that
is
submitted
waiting
term
here.
also,
i
have
argued
in
three
and
four
other
cases,
already
submitted
to
state
courts
and
one
on
the
federal
court
in
southern
district
where
the
type
of
right
involved
here
that
your
honors
decide
--
everything
is
hinging
upon
this
and
it
is
non-residency.
residency
is
my
northern
--
this
problem
in
the
northern
state
of
iowa
--
federal
court.
but
the
other
cases
also
depend
what
is
a
nature
of
this
right.
is
it
a
first
amendment
right,
if
so
it
makes
a
difference?
what
type
of
cases
am
i
talking
about,
what
did
judge
van
oosterhout
asked
in
the
three-panel
court
the
other
day?
he
said,
“isn't
this
of
a
nature
of
the
right
important
in
this
kind
of
a
case?”
here's
at
the
lady
on
the
stand,
who
had
been
getting
welfare
and
she
said
that
she
didn't
--
she
didn't
appeal
to
the
administrative
board.
she
had
been
getting
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
and
i
don't
require
enough
to
remember
the
amount
but
she
had
been
getting
welfare.
it
was
cut
off.
she
didn't
even
come
into
the
local
board
and
say,
“you
folks
are
wrong,
i
don't
have
a
job
where
i
make
that
much
money.”
well,
she
must
have
a
job
that
she
made
that
much
money
or
she
would
have
come
in
and
protest
it.
but
now
she
wants
the
pounding,
she
wants
to
stay,
she
wants
a
federal
matching
funds
to
go
ahead
and
keep
paying
her
that
when
she
doesn't
even
take
care
of
her
own
rights
and
say
to
the
state
and
the
county
that,
“i
have
to
have
a
fair
hearing
here,
my
constitutional
rights
are
infringed
upon
this,”
what's
she's
saying?
she
didn't
do
anything
to
protect
herself.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
too,
but
thank
you.

she
said
that
she
didn't
--
she
didn't
appeal
to
the
administrative
board.
she
had
been
getting
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
and
i
don't
require
enough
to
remember
the
amount
but
she
had
been
getting
welfare.
it
was
cut
off.
she
didn't
even
come
into
the
local
board
and
say,
“you
folks
are
wrong,
i
don't
have
a
job
where
i
make
that
much
money.”
well,
she
must
have
a
job
that
she
made
that
much
money
or
she
would
have
come
in
and
protest
it.
but
now
she
wants
the
pounding,
she
wants
to
stay,
she
wants
a
federal
matching
funds
to
go
ahead
and
keep
paying
her
that
when
she
doesn't
even
take
care
of
her
own
rights
and
say
to
the
state
and
the
county
that,
“i
have
to
have
a
fair
hearing
here,
my
constitutional
rights
are
infringed
upon
this,”
what's
she's
saying?
she
didn't
do
anything
to
protect
herself.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
too,
but
thank
you.
