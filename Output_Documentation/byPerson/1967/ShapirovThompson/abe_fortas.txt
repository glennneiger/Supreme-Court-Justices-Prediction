justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
williams,
i
beg
your
pardon.
does
iowa
have
residence
requirements
for
other
types
of
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
welfare
program
in
which
there
is
no
residence
requirement
in
your
state?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
why
would
there
be
any
exception.
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
there
be
any
exceptions
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
you're
defending
iowa's
making
a
distinction
between
dependent
children
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
and
those
who
have
not
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
on
the
grounds
of
fiscal
necessity
and
administrative
convenience.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
have
any
application
here
in
your
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
have
to
compare
--
do
you
have
to
compare
a
dependent
child
who
does
not
get
these
payments
with
a
dependent
child
who
does
on
account
of
residence?
and
does
the
equal
protection
affect
that
at
all?
that's
really
a
basic
constitutional
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
residence
requirement
for
voting,
i
shouldn't
think
would
affect
the
mobility
of
people
when
they
travel
from
states
whereas
i
think
the
principal
point
here
is
that
the
residency
for
this
welfare
of
payments,
requirement
of
residency
for
these
welfare
payments
may
have
--
maybe
a
burden
on
what
is
called
the
right
to
travel,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
important,
go
ahead.
the
voting
would
not
--
if
i
may
just
go
direct
to
the
facts
and
set
them
before
the
court.
at
the
time
that
the
appellee
entered
the
state,
she
was
unwed.
her
purpose
in
coming
to
the
state
has
been
stipulated
too
in
the
record
as
to
be
near
her
mother
who
had
been
resting
in
the
state
of
connecticut
for
eight
years.
she
had
been
receiving
welfare
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
she
came
in
to
connecticut
and
resided
for
approximately
two-and-a-half
months
with
her
mother
before
she
turned
to
the
state
for
assistance.
she
initially
turn
to
the
city
of
hartford,
department
of
public
welfare
for
what
we
call
in
connecticut,
temporary
assistance
and
that
was
granted
the
day
after
it
was
applied
for
even
though
the
residence
requirement
in
connecticut
exist
for
purposes
of
afdc,
the
aid
to
the
families
with
dependent
children.
it
does
not
apply
at
least
for
a
period
of
60
days
for
temporary
assistance
which
is
submitted
--
administered
by
the
local
welfare
units.
now,
she
then
applied
to
the
state
for
afdc
and
she
was
denied
assistance
in
the
sole
ground
that
she
had
not
met
the
one
year
or
the
durational
residence
required
in
connecticut.
this
action
was
taken
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
a
resident
of
massachusetts.
she
had
no
intention
of
going
back
to
massachusetts.
she
had
no
desire
to
go
back
to
massachusetts
and
in
fact,
is
she's
going
back
to
massachusetts
she
would
have
been
ineligible
for
afdc.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
that
that
applies
to
all
types
of
assistance?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
apply
to
old
age?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
hollander
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
this.
you
have
this
three-month
disqualification
of
everybody,
is
that
right?
and
is
there
an
additional
period
of
disqualification
for
the
adc?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
does
that
work?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
mean
to
say
that
if
a
person
migrates
to
connecticut
with
dependent
children
and
she
comes
there
with
a
job
then
she
is
entitled
to
the
adc
payments
three
months
after
she
arrives.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
she
comes
there
without
a
job
and
without
personal
resources
as
you
have
described
them
then
she
has
to
wait
one
year
--
for
a
year
to
pass.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
the
explanation
of
that
--
what
is
the
facial
explanation
of
that
or
the
explanation
of
your
adversary?
what's
the
justification
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
say
that
she
qualifies
as
a
resident,
on
what
basis?
is
it
just
because
her
intention
to
reside
there
indefinitely.
is
there
anything
in
connecticut
law
that
would
indicate
or
any
purpose
that
standing
alone
is
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
and
actually,
your
submission
does
not
depend
upon
residence,
does
it?
your
submission
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
depend
upon
how
the
state
chooses
to
define
resident
for
state
purposes
regardless
of
how
the
state
defines
resident
for
straight
purposes
that
there
is
a
supervening
federal
constitutional
principle
here
that
requires
that
dependent
children
all
be
treated
alike,
allowing
of
course
for
whatever
period
of
administration
or
investigation
might
be
necessary.
is
that
your
position
by
making
that
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
means
that
connecticut
can
satisfy
itself
if
the
person
lives
there.
it
should
get
away
from
technical
definitions
of
residence
or
domiciliary
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
really
to
protect
the
treasury
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
prevent
these
100,000
people
from
coming
here
because
it
will
be
a
burden
on
the
district
treasury
if
they
come
here.
perhaps
a
burden
which
in
totally
will
make
the
adc
payments
look
like
nothing
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
is
that
just
because
of
edwards?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
sir.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
when
your
residence
requirement
does
not
affect
the
travel
of
people
between
the
district
and
the
various
states.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
implies
if
it
does
affect
in
your
information.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
excess
sunshine
which
california
had
attracted
people
from
the
other
states
in
california
are
to
be
able
to
offset
by
reasonable
rule
and
regulation.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
on
the
commerce
part
of
the
argument
is
that
--
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
effect
of
the
one
year
restriction
maybe
a
burden
on
free
movement
of
people
in
commerce
but
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
burden
because
of
its
relatively
small
impact,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
in
old
age
assistance,
i
suppose
that
the
residence
requirements
applies
equal
at
all
the
people
of
the
same
age,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
a
point
of
distinction
here
with
respect
to
aid
of
a
benefit
of
dependent
children.
you
may
have
children
who
are
exactly
the
same
age,
exactly
the
same
circumstances,
exactly
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
being
born
with
or
without
benefit
of
clergy
and
there
is
a
differentiation
made
on
the
basis
of
the
residence
of
their
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
edwards
against
california
have
any
bearing
upon
a
district
of
columbia
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
the
commerce
clause.
justice
abe
fortas
can
congress
constitutionally
enact
a
law
saying,
only
so
many
people
from
each
state
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
enter
the
district
of
columbia
in
any
period
of
time.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
you
think
--
you
think
that
the
individual
whom
they
want
to
end
in
the
district
of
columbia
despite
the
quotas
where
it
has
some
sort
of
a
right
to
do
so.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
lose
me
now
because
i'm
trying
to
follow
you.
what
is
the
--
i
want
to
ask
you
again,
what
is
your
contention
with
respect
to
your
point
that
the
individual
has
a
right
to
travel
as
against
congressional
legislation
as
distinguished
in
the
state
legislation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
your
argument
that
that
right
to
travel
so
derived
or
i
assume
that
it's
so
derived
is
a
fundamental
right
which
is
entitled
to
sort
of
quasi
first
amendment
status.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
attorney
general
but
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
county
welfare
payments.
are
they
welfare
payments
or
do
they
provide
for
residence
of
the
indigent
in
the
county
home?
justice
abe
fortas
your
county
--
there
is
no
provision
for
the
county
to
make
welfare
payments.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
county
what
usually
called
for
houses.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
the
states
could
doctor
a
rule
talking
about
--
just
about
state
authority
saying
that
welfare
payments
will
not
be
made
to
anybody
who
is
not
a
resident
of
a
state
on
january
1,
1969.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that'll
be
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
does
it
make
if
its
federal
firms?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they
were
federal
funds?
justice
abe
fortas
federal
land
state
funds.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
a
constitution
invade
--
did
invade
states
rights,
sir,
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
substantial
invasion
of
states
rights
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
right
to
travel?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
right
to
travel?
was
that
one
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
was
expressly
considered
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
being
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
asking
is
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
as
you
read
--
as
you
read
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
a
right
to
travel
expressly,
specifically,
explicitly
considered
in
the
congress
as
one
of
the
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
it
discussed
in
the
congressional
consideration
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
from
my
recollection,
because
the
last
argument
was
the
evidence
on
both
sides
is
to
the
amount
of
interstate
migration
related
to
persons
who
would
be
eligible
like
the
other
people
who
(inaudible)
there
was
this
migration
which
is
not
very
big.
justice
abe
fortas
where
--
what
--
what
study
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
the
problem
ms.
williams,
our
problem
is
a
constitutional
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
to
a
--
suppose
a
state
said
that
we
will
not
provide
the
relief
payments
to
anybody
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
in
the
1st
of
january,
1969.
justice
abe
fortas
and
thereby
excluded
anybody
coming
into
the
state
from
other
states
--
justice
abe
fortas
--or
may
access
to
welfare.
now,
would
that
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
arbitrary
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
within
the
constitution.
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
now
right
--
right
now,
i
firmly
respectfully
suggest
that
i
think
your
problem
is
to
distinguish
that
and
the
present
situation.
in
the
present
situation,
you
do
not
have
as
the
test
residency,
you
have
as
the
test
residency
for
one
year,
is
that
right?
and
those
are
not
the
same,
are
they
ms.
williams?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
five
years
be
arbitrary?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
your
--
in
your
position
i
think
it
boils
down
to
the
point
that
you
think
that
a
one
year
residence
requirement
is
reasonable
and
therefore
supportable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
five
years
might
not
be
a
permanent
when
certainly
would
--
would
not
be,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
hew
here
--
hew
manual
set
forth
the
--
the
procedure
and
techniques
for
determining
residents
as
distinguished
from
duration
of
residence.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
those
are
little
more
specific
than
your
last
statements
indicated.
do
you
remember
them?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
require
under
the
hew
manual
to
determine
(a)
residents
and
(b)
duration
of
residence
as
separate
things?
do
you
read
it
that
way?
that's
where
it
would
seem
to
read
to
me
but
--
that
i
know
of.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
really
what
they
said?
or
then
they
say,
“you
have
to
be
a
resident
and
you
have
to
have
been
a
resident
for
a
year.”
in
other
words,
that
--
that's
possible
for
somebody
to
live
here
for
a
year
and
not
have
the
intent
necessary
to
constitute
residence.
now,
perhaps
that's
theoretical.
but
as
i
understand
the
way
the
manuals
are
setup,
they
do
make
that
distinction.
am
i
wrong?
are
you
asserting
that
i'm
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
asserting
--
you
are
asserting
that
--
and
weren't
necessary
for
congress
to
hold
on
an
inducement
to
the
states
to
participate
on
a
program.
that
necessity
provides
a
sufficient
reason
to
justify
what
might
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
the
word
“and”
was
not
in
your
first
statement
of
it.
why
is
it?
what
is
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
states
participate.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
congress
could
--
suppose
congress
found
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
get
the
states
to
participate
in
a
public
school
building
program
to
allow
the
states
to
have
a
--
have
a
segregation
in
the
schools
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
make
it
legitimate?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
have
any
case
in
which
it's
ever
been
held
that
the
purpose
of
congress
that
the
need
to
induce
states
to
participate
provided
a
lawful
legislative
purpose
for
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
when
quite
did
congress
authorize
one
year
or
directed
one
year,
congress
said
too
that
state
program,
which
included
the
one-year
residency
requirement,
would
be
accepted
and
now
it's
in
the
district
of
columbia
legislation.the
situation
is
different
of
course.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
new
york
now
has
no
residence
requirement
at
all
for
afdc.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
congress
didn't
mandate
it
in
the
sense
of
requiring
the
states
to
adapt
it.
that's
my
only
point.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
--
it
said
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
include
a
residence
requirement
up
to
one
year
that
that
residency
requirement
would
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
preclude
acceptance
of
the
plan.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
would
you
agree
though
mr.
cox
if
--
if
you
start
with
the
commerce
clause
and
the
right
to
travel
as
incident
to
that,
i
mean,
so
that
one
like,
i
said,
that
particular
line
of
reasoning
then
the
act
of
--
then
the
action
of
congress,
even
on
your
construction
in
402
(b),
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
conclusion.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
have
you
come
across
any
figures
on
how
much
it
costs
to
conduct
these
one-year
investigations?
i
remember
seeing
somewhere
a
suggestion
that
the
cost
was
extremely
high.
justice
abe
fortas
general
are
you
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
arguing
are
you
that
a
residence
requirement
as
distinguished
from
a
durational
residence
requirement
would
meet
the
same
constitutional
objectives?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
nor
i
am.
and
i
suppose
that
a
brief
period
of
time
to
inquire
whether
a
person
is
a
bona
fide
resident
would
also
be
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
general,
in
all
of
these
states,
are
there
comparable
--
is
there
a
comparable
linkage
that
is
to
say
comparable
to
the
connecticut
linkage
between
the
denial
of
the
one-year
residence,
and
on
one
hand,
then
the
expulsion
of
the
person
so
to
speak,
sending
a
person
back
to
the
state
of
origin?
i
do
remember
as
you
just
--
and
you
just
refreshed
my
memory
on
that
that
the
connecticut
seems
to
contemplate
the
--
as
a
matter
of
routine
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
person
will
be
expelled
from
the
jurisdiction.
justice
abe
fortas
to
go
back.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
do
have
to
quickly
--
to
cut
over
to
your
point
three
and
say,
“a
discrimination
which
has
no
basis.”
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
said
it
right
there,
you
have
to
do
it.
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
can
do
it
anyway
you
want
to,
but
i
mean
to
say
that,
obviously,
that's
an
essential
part
of
your
argument
on
that
point
because
the
response
to
it
otherwise
would
be
too
easy
which
is,
unnecessarily,
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
discrimination
between
the
two
once
you
agree
that
the
state
may
legitimately
and
constitutionally
take
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
investigate
the
new
comer
to
see
whether
he
is
in
fact
a
resident.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
perhaps
some
other
clearity
and
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
is
that
in
these
circumstances
a
state's
payment
ceased
when
the
person
goes
ahead
with
this
--
by
hypothesis,
surreptitious
and
concealed
intention
to
leave
the
state
so
that
the
state's
interest
perhaps
in
continuation
of
residence,
maybe
less
than
it
is
and
some
other
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
also
if
you
look
at
this
from
a
point
of
view
of
the
right
to
travel
and
the
right
to
migrate
that
the
denial
of
a
welfare
benefits
for
a
year
could
be
considered
to
be
much
more
of
a
discouragement
or
much
more
of
a
burden
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
constitution
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox
said
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
--
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
furnish
us
with
a
memorandum
setting
forth
the
figures
that
you
gave
us
as
to
the
increase
that
occurred
in
these
various
jurisdictions.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
mean
you
say
whatever
you
said
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
oral
argument
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
stating
the
basis
for
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
i
have
come
across
statements
to
the
effect
that
some
of
these
states
that
have
climate
such
as
far
western
states.
the
children
of
migrants
were
not
allowed
into
the
public
school
because
they
don't
satisfy
the
residence
requirement
and
also,
same
sort
of
statement
with
respect
to
access
to
state
health
facilities
is
assuming
that
that
(inaudible)
related
conceptual
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
but
a
negative
answer
here
--
what
--
what
a
negative
answer
here
indicate
a
fortiori
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
negative
answer
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
were
to
lose
these
cases,
would
that
indicate
a
negative
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
these
migrants
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
go
to
school?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
williams,
i
beg
your
pardon.
does
iowa
have
residence
requirements
for
other
types
of
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
welfare
program
in
which
there
is
no
residence
requirement
in
your
state?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
why
would
there
be
any
exception.
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
there
be
any
exceptions
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
you're
defending
iowa's
making
a
distinction
between
dependent
children
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
and
those
who
have
not
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
on
the
grounds
of
fiscal
necessity
and
administrative
convenience.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
have
any
application
here
in
your
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
have
to
compare
--
do
you
have
to
compare
a
dependent
child
who
does
not
get
these
payments
with
a
dependent
child
who
does
on
account
of
residence?
and
does
the
equal
protection
affect
that
at
all?
that's
really
a
basic
constitutional
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
residence
requirement
for
voting,
i
shouldn't
think
would
affect
the
mobility
of
people
when
they
travel
from
states
whereas
i
think
the
principal
point
here
is
that
the
residency
for
this
welfare
of
payments,
requirement
of
residency
for
these
welfare
payments
may
have
--
maybe
a
burden
on
what
is
called
the
right
to
travel,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
important,
go
ahead.
the
voting
would
not
--
if
i
may
just
go
direct
to
the
facts
and
set
them
before
the
court.
at
the
time
that
the
appellee
entered
the
state,
she
was
unwed.
her
purpose
in
coming
to
the
state
has
been
stipulated
too
in
the
record
as
to
be
near
her
mother
who
had
been
resting
in
the
state
of
connecticut
for
eight
years.
she
had
been
receiving
welfare
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
she
came
in
to
connecticut
and
resided
for
approximately
two-and-a-half
months
with
her
mother
before
she
turned
to
the
state
for
assistance.
she
initially
turn
to
the
city
of
hartford,
department
of
public
welfare
for
what
we
call
in
connecticut,
temporary
assistance
and
that
was
granted
the
day
after
it
was
applied
for
even
though
the
residence
requirement
in
connecticut
exist
for
purposes
of
afdc,
the
aid
to
the
families
with
dependent
children.
it
does
not
apply
at
least
for
a
period
of
60
days
for
temporary
assistance
which
is
submitted
--
administered
by
the
local
welfare
units.
now,
she
then
applied
to
the
state
for
afdc
and
she
was
denied
assistance
in
the
sole
ground
that
she
had
not
met
the
one
year
or
the
durational
residence
required
in
connecticut.
this
action
was
taken
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
a
resident
of
massachusetts.
she
had
no
intention
of
going
back
to
massachusetts.
she
had
no
desire
to
go
back
to
massachusetts
and
in
fact,
is
she's
going
back
to
massachusetts
she
would
have
been
ineligible
for
afdc.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
that
that
applies
to
all
types
of
assistance?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
apply
to
old
age?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
hollander
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
this.
you
have
this
three-month
disqualification
of
everybody,
is
that
right?
and
is
there
an
additional
period
of
disqualification
for
the
adc?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
does
that
work?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
mean
to
say
that
if
a
person
migrates
to
connecticut
with
dependent
children
and
she
comes
there
with
a
job
then
she
is
entitled
to
the
adc
payments
three
months
after
she
arrives.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
she
comes
there
without
a
job
and
without
personal
resources
as
you
have
described
them
then
she
has
to
wait
one
year
--
for
a
year
to
pass.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
the
explanation
of
that
--
what
is
the
facial
explanation
of
that
or
the
explanation
of
your
adversary?
what's
the
justification
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
say
that
she
qualifies
as
a
resident,
on
what
basis?
is
it
just
because
her
intention
to
reside
there
indefinitely.
is
there
anything
in
connecticut
law
that
would
indicate
or
any
purpose
that
standing
alone
is
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
and
actually,
your
submission
does
not
depend
upon
residence,
does
it?
your
submission
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
depend
upon
how
the
state
chooses
to
define
resident
for
state
purposes
regardless
of
how
the
state
defines
resident
for
straight
purposes
that
there
is
a
supervening
federal
constitutional
principle
here
that
requires
that
dependent
children
all
be
treated
alike,
allowing
of
course
for
whatever
period
of
administration
or
investigation
might
be
necessary.
is
that
your
position
by
making
that
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
means
that
connecticut
can
satisfy
itself
if
the
person
lives
there.
it
should
get
away
from
technical
definitions
of
residence
or
domiciliary
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
really
to
protect
the
treasury
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
prevent
these
100,000
people
from
coming
here
because
it
will
be
a
burden
on
the
district
treasury
if
they
come
here.
perhaps
a
burden
which
in
totally
will
make
the
adc
payments
look
like
nothing
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
is
that
just
because
of
edwards?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
sir.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
when
your
residence
requirement
does
not
affect
the
travel
of
people
between
the
district
and
the
various
states.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
implies
if
it
does
affect
in
your
information.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
excess
sunshine
which
california
had
attracted
people
from
the
other
states
in
california
are
to
be
able
to
offset
by
reasonable
rule
and
regulation.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
on
the
commerce
part
of
the
argument
is
that
--
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
effect
of
the
one
year
restriction
maybe
a
burden
on
free
movement
of
people
in
commerce
but
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
burden
because
of
its
relatively
small
impact,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
in
old
age
assistance,
i
suppose
that
the
residence
requirements
applies
equal
at
all
the
people
of
the
same
age,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
a
point
of
distinction
here
with
respect
to
aid
of
a
benefit
of
dependent
children.
you
may
have
children
who
are
exactly
the
same
age,
exactly
the
same
circumstances,
exactly
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
being
born
with
or
without
benefit
of
clergy
and
there
is
a
differentiation
made
on
the
basis
of
the
residence
of
their
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
edwards
against
california
have
any
bearing
upon
a
district
of
columbia
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
the
commerce
clause.
justice
abe
fortas
can
congress
constitutionally
enact
a
law
saying,
only
so
many
people
from
each
state
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
enter
the
district
of
columbia
in
any
period
of
time.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
you
think
--
you
think
that
the
individual
whom
they
want
to
end
in
the
district
of
columbia
despite
the
quotas
where
it
has
some
sort
of
a
right
to
do
so.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
lose
me
now
because
i'm
trying
to
follow
you.
what
is
the
--
i
want
to
ask
you
again,
what
is
your
contention
with
respect
to
your
point
that
the
individual
has
a
right
to
travel
as
against
congressional
legislation
as
distinguished
in
the
state
legislation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
your
argument
that
that
right
to
travel
so
derived
or
i
assume
that
it's
so
derived
is
a
fundamental
right
which
is
entitled
to
sort
of
quasi
first
amendment
status.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
attorney
general
but
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
county
welfare
payments.
are
they
welfare
payments
or
do
they
provide
for
residence
of
the
indigent
in
the
county
home?
justice
abe
fortas
your
county
--
there
is
no
provision
for
the
county
to
make
welfare
payments.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
county
what
usually
called
for
houses.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
the
states
could
doctor
a
rule
talking
about
--
just
about
state
authority
saying
that
welfare
payments
will
not
be
made
to
anybody
who
is
not
a
resident
of
a
state
on
january
1,
1969.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that'll
be
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
does
it
make
if
its
federal
firms?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they
were
federal
funds?
justice
abe
fortas
federal
land
state
funds.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
a
constitution
invade
--
did
invade
states
rights,
sir,
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
substantial
invasion
of
states
rights
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
right
to
travel?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
right
to
travel?
was
that
one
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
was
expressly
considered
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
being
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
asking
is
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
as
you
read
--
as
you
read
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
a
right
to
travel
expressly,
specifically,
explicitly
considered
in
the
congress
as
one
of
the
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
it
discussed
in
the
congressional
consideration
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
from
my
recollection,
because
the
last
argument
was
the
evidence
on
both
sides
is
to
the
amount
of
interstate
migration
related
to
persons
who
would
be
eligible
like
the
other
people
who
(inaudible)
there
was
this
migration
which
is
not
very
big.
justice
abe
fortas
where
--
what
--
what
study
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
the
problem
ms.
williams,
our
problem
is
a
constitutional
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
to
a
--
suppose
a
state
said
that
we
will
not
provide
the
relief
payments
to
anybody
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
in
the
1st
of
january,
1969.
justice
abe
fortas
and
thereby
excluded
anybody
coming
into
the
state
from
other
states
--
justice
abe
fortas
--or
may
access
to
welfare.
now,
would
that
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
arbitrary
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
within
the
constitution.
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
now
right
--
right
now,
i
firmly
respectfully
suggest
that
i
think
your
problem
is
to
distinguish
that
and
the
present
situation.
in
the
present
situation,
you
do
not
have
as
the
test
residency,
you
have
as
the
test
residency
for
one
year,
is
that
right?
and
those
are
not
the
same,
are
they
ms.
williams?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
five
years
be
arbitrary?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
your
--
in
your
position
i
think
it
boils
down
to
the
point
that
you
think
that
a
one
year
residence
requirement
is
reasonable
and
therefore
supportable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
five
years
might
not
be
a
permanent
when
certainly
would
--
would
not
be,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
hew
here
--
hew
manual
set
forth
the
--
the
procedure
and
techniques
for
determining
residents
as
distinguished
from
duration
of
residence.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
those
are
little
more
specific
than
your
last
statements
indicated.
do
you
remember
them?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
require
under
the
hew
manual
to
determine
(a)
residents
and
(b)
duration
of
residence
as
separate
things?
do
you
read
it
that
way?
that's
where
it
would
seem
to
read
to
me
but
--
that
i
know
of.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
really
what
they
said?
or
then
they
say,
“you
have
to
be
a
resident
and
you
have
to
have
been
a
resident
for
a
year.”
in
other
words,
that
--
that's
possible
for
somebody
to
live
here
for
a
year
and
not
have
the
intent
necessary
to
constitute
residence.
now,
perhaps
that's
theoretical.
but
as
i
understand
the
way
the
manuals
are
setup,
they
do
make
that
distinction.
am
i
wrong?
are
you
asserting
that
i'm
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
asserting
--
you
are
asserting
that
--
and
weren't
necessary
for
congress
to
hold
on
an
inducement
to
the
states
to
participate
on
a
program.
that
necessity
provides
a
sufficient
reason
to
justify
what
might
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
the
word
“and”
was
not
in
your
first
statement
of
it.
why
is
it?
what
is
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
states
participate.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
congress
could
--
suppose
congress
found
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
get
the
states
to
participate
in
a
public
school
building
program
to
allow
the
states
to
have
a
--
have
a
segregation
in
the
schools
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
make
it
legitimate?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
have
any
case
in
which
it's
ever
been
held
that
the
purpose
of
congress
that
the
need
to
induce
states
to
participate
provided
a
lawful
legislative
purpose
for
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
when
quite
did
congress
authorize
one
year
or
directed
one
year,
congress
said
too
that
state
program,
which
included
the
one-year
residency
requirement,
would
be
accepted
and
now
it's
in
the
district
of
columbia
legislation.the
situation
is
different
of
course.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
new
york
now
has
no
residence
requirement
at
all
for
afdc.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
congress
didn't
mandate
it
in
the
sense
of
requiring
the
states
to
adapt
it.
that's
my
only
point.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
--
it
said
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
include
a
residence
requirement
up
to
one
year
that
that
residency
requirement
would
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
preclude
acceptance
of
the
plan.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
would
you
agree
though
mr.
cox
if
--
if
you
start
with
the
commerce
clause
and
the
right
to
travel
as
incident
to
that,
i
mean,
so
that
one
like,
i
said,
that
particular
line
of
reasoning
then
the
act
of
--
then
the
action
of
congress,
even
on
your
construction
in
402
(b),
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
conclusion.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
have
you
come
across
any
figures
on
how
much
it
costs
to
conduct
these
one-year
investigations?
i
remember
seeing
somewhere
a
suggestion
that
the
cost
was
extremely
high.
justice
abe
fortas
general
are
you
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
arguing
are
you
that
a
residence
requirement
as
distinguished
from
a
durational
residence
requirement
would
meet
the
same
constitutional
objectives?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
nor
i
am.
and
i
suppose
that
a
brief
period
of
time
to
inquire
whether
a
person
is
a
bona
fide
resident
would
also
be
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
general,
in
all
of
these
states,
are
there
comparable
--
is
there
a
comparable
linkage
that
is
to
say
comparable
to
the
connecticut
linkage
between
the
denial
of
the
one-year
residence,
and
on
one
hand,
then
the
expulsion
of
the
person
so
to
speak,
sending
a
person
back
to
the
state
of
origin?
i
do
remember
as
you
just
--
and
you
just
refreshed
my
memory
on
that
that
the
connecticut
seems
to
contemplate
the
--
as
a
matter
of
routine
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
person
will
be
expelled
from
the
jurisdiction.
justice
abe
fortas
to
go
back.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
do
have
to
quickly
--
to
cut
over
to
your
point
three
and
say,
“a
discrimination
which
has
no
basis.”
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
said
it
right
there,
you
have
to
do
it.
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
can
do
it
anyway
you
want
to,
but
i
mean
to
say
that,
obviously,
that's
an
essential
part
of
your
argument
on
that
point
because
the
response
to
it
otherwise
would
be
too
easy
which
is,
unnecessarily,
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
discrimination
between
the
two
once
you
agree
that
the
state
may
legitimately
and
constitutionally
take
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
investigate
the
new
comer
to
see
whether
he
is
in
fact
a
resident.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
perhaps
some
other
clearity
and
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
is
that
in
these
circumstances
a
state's
payment
ceased
when
the
person
goes
ahead
with
this
--
by
hypothesis,
surreptitious
and
concealed
intention
to
leave
the
state
so
that
the
state's
interest
perhaps
in
continuation
of
residence,
maybe
less
than
it
is
and
some
other
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
also
if
you
look
at
this
from
a
point
of
view
of
the
right
to
travel
and
the
right
to
migrate
that
the
denial
of
a
welfare
benefits
for
a
year
could
be
considered
to
be
much
more
of
a
discouragement
or
much
more
of
a
burden

constitution
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox
said
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
--
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
furnish
us
with
a
memorandum
setting
forth
the
figures
that
you
gave
us
as
to
the
increase
that
occurred
in
these
various
jurisdictions.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
mean
you
say
whatever
you
said
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
oral
argument
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
stating
the
basis
for
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
i
have
come
across
statements
to
the
effect
that
some
of
these
states
that
have
climate
such
as
far
western
states.
the
children
of
migrants
were
not
allowed
into
the
public
school
because
they
don't
satisfy
the
residence
requirement
and
also,
same
sort
of
statement
with
respect
to
access
to
state
health
facilities
is
assuming
that
that
(inaudible)
related
conceptual
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
but
a
negative
answer
here
--
what
--
what
a
negative
answer
here
indicate
a
fortiori
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
negative
answer
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
were
to
lose
these
cases,
would
that
indicate
a
negative
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
these
migrants
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
go
to
school?
