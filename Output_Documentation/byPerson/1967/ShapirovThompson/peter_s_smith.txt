mr.
peter
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
deeply
mention
the
facts
in
this
case
if
i
may,
because
i
think
they
make
it
somewhat
easier
to
understand
some
of
the
legal
arguments.
there
were
four
appellees;
one
as
the
court
knows
recently
passed
away,
three
of
them,
all
but
one
vera
barley
who
was
residing
in
st.elizabeth's
hospital
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
from
arkansas,
new
york,
south
carolina
respectively
for
reasons
which
are
elaborated
in
some
details
in
the
complaints
and
in
the
affidavits
to
support
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
is
part
of
this
record
and
we
referred
to
them
extensively
our
case.
these
people
came
here
for
the
reasons
we
think
that
people
do
move.
mrs.
harold
came
here
because
she
was
ill
with
cancer
and
she
had
three
children
and
she
wanted
to
be
assured
that
her
brother
and
her
sister
could
take
care
of
those
children
if
something
happened
to
her.
ms.
brown
had
been
here
on
a
numerous
occasions
before
had
gone
to
school
here
and
was
returning
here
for
very
good
reasons
because
she
was
unable
to
live
in
fort
smith,
arkansas
anymore
because
she
was
not
eligible
for
public
housing.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
show
two
things.
first
of
all
the
record
very
clearly
show
why
the
appellees
here
moved
and
motivation
and
so
on
and
i
think
the
second
thing
they
show
is
the
typical
reasons
why
people
move.
they
move
to
be
with
family.
they
move
to
seek
employment
and
new
horizons.
i
think
those
facts
need
to
be
kept
in
mind
as
we
analyze
the
issues
here.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
none
of
them
moved
here
for
the
purpose
of
getting
public
aid
mr.
justice
black.
two
of
them
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
i
was
referring
to
the
families.
they
have
families
here
and
those
families
could
take
care
of
their
children
in
the
case
of
mrs.
harold.
she
was
ill
with
cancer
and
if
she
die,
she
wanted
to
know
that
there
was
a
family
here
who
could
then
take
care
of
her
children
and
she
had
a
brother
and
a
sister
here
and
so
it
was
important
for
her
to
move
here
for
that
reason.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
one
of
the
reasons
according
to
her
affidavit,
it's
proper
to
remove
but
only
one
reason,
was
that
her
mother
left
arkansas
for
oklahoma,
had
give
up
public
housing
so
she
had
no
place
to
live
and
so
there
she
was,
wondering
what
to
do
and
it's
a
very
logical
thing
for
her
to
come
to
new
horizon
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
she
have
family,
where
she
could
come
with
her
children
and
where
she
could
seek
a
better
life.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
suppose
she
knew
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
reflects
that
she
knew
what
sort
of
housing
she
would
get
here.
she
didn't
know
that
she
have
relatives
here
that
she
could
stay
with
and
of
course
she
did
for
14
months
until
she
later
found
housing.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
fundamentally,
it
does
not
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
seem
to
have
troubled
a
number
of
counsels
in
these
many
cases
and
i
think
a
number
of
judges
is
the
gut
feeling
that
one
has
that
people
are
running
around
the
country
seeking
to
gain
public
assistance
and
if
that
really
were
so,
i
don't
suggest
that
constitutional
issues
would
be
different
but
i
think
one
needs
to
recognize
that
that
sort
of
underlying
feeling
is
involved
when
we
look
at
these
issues
and
i
think
largely
it's
not
completely,
it's
unsupportable.
now,
the
theory
of
our
case
is
equal
protection.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
classifications
here
or
rather
a
classification
of
two
groups.
the
first,
anyone
who
has
lived
here
more
than
a
year
and
the
second,
anyone
who
has
lived
here
less
than
a
year
and
i
might
emphasize
--
mr.
barton
mentioned
this
fact
that
the
district
statute
is
quite
difficult
here.
as
far
as
i
know,
connecticut
has
the
only
statute
that
has
this
subclassification
--
the
district
of
pennsylvania
that
you'll
hear
about
shortly
and
that
all
of
the
others
are
just
straight
forward,
once
year
residence
requirements
is
a
very
clear
classification.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
are
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
parties?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
in
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
one
of
the
appellees
would
be
seeking
aid
of
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
that
is
vera
barley,
the
one
who
resided
in
st.
elizabeth's
hospital,
all
the
others
seek
afdc,
aid
for
dependent
children.
in
the
case
of
connecticut
and
in
case
of
--
i
believe
there
are
two
appellees
in
pennsylvania.
they
are
all
seeking
afdc.
so
the
exception
of
the
person
who
is
residing
in
st.
elizabeth's
who
of
course
would
not
be
eligible
for
afdc.
they
are
all
seeking
the
same
kind
of
aid.
now,
as
i
indicated
i
think
the
classification
in
the
two
groups
is
clear.
now,
this
court
of
course
has
annunciated
that
long
ago
what
the
applicable
test
for
equal
protection
are.
in
the
gulf
case
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
and
many
cases
since
mclaughlin
and
so
on.
the
court
has
indicated
that
a
statue
will
violate
equal
protection
either
because
of
the
classification
itself
must
fall
and
we're
not
suggesting
and
our
theory
is
not
bad
here
or
if
the
classification
does
not
per
se
unconstitutional
or
perhaps
this
may
only
be
suspect
as
in
the
many
cases.
it
must
be
reasonably
related
to
lawful
governmental
purpose
and
i
upsize
two
things.
one,
reasonably
related
and
the
second,
a
lawful
purpose
because
as
i
will
demonstrate
shortly,
it
is
we
believe
in
some
respects
not
reasonably
related
to
some
purposes
and
in
other
respects,
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
purpose
i
believe
but
i
think
that
purpose
is
clearly
unconstitutional
per
se
so
it
must
meet
those
two
tests.
now,
i
think
the
lines
are
fairly,
clearly
drawn
here
on
the
question
of
the
approach
of
this
court.
mr.
barton
has
conceded
of
course
that
if
the
court
would
adjudge
the
statute
and
understand
this
strict
scrutiny.
now,
our
contention
is
that
this
case
should
be
judged
by
those
standards
and
i
would
not
concede
at
all
that
we're
judged
under
any
standards,
it
would
fall
because
i
think
it's
going
to
be
clear
that
they're
just
on
any
lawful
objectives
at
all
that
it
has
been
offered
or
that
can
be
drained
up.
in
any
event,
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
standards
that
should
apply
here
when
this
court
used
this
case
are
those
strict
standards.
now,
reference
is
made
to
first
amendment
cases
and
a
reference
was
made
to
cases
involved
in
racial
discrimination
but
that
factor
doesn't
stop
there.
the
court
supplied
it
in
other
areas
many
years
ago
in
skinner
versus
oklahoma
involving
the
fundamental
rights
appropriation
did
not
involved
racial
discrimination
and
it
did
not
involve
the
first
amendment
right.
griswold
versus
connecticut
although
parts
of
it
might
be
said
to
stem
from
emanations
of
the
first
amendment
basically,
that's
not
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
griswold?
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
which
opinion
you
focus
on
there
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
have
intended
mainly
to
focus
on
the
majority
of
the
several
concurring
opinions
and
i
understand
you
to
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that's
right.
i
understand
you
mr.
justice
white
to
put
it
clearly
on
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
personally
feel
that
it's
a
fifth
amendment
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
feel
it
is
due
process.
i
feel
abstention
of
liberty
from
what
my
personal
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
it's
obvious
that
this
case
involved
peculiar
situations.
the
fundamental
rights
of
merits
and
so
on
which
you
eluded
to
and
which
a
number
of
the
other
opinions
eluded
to
and
of
course
harper
versus
board
of
elections.
there's
language
in
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
which
squarely
states
that
when
this
sort
of
a
classification
is
involved,
we
must
use
a
strict
scrutiny.
racial
discrimination?
first
amendment?
it
was
an
equal
protection
case.
now,
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
the
voting?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
was
a
voting
case
and
that's
correct
but
of
course
that's
not
a
first
amendment
case
and
it's
not
another
race
case.
i'm
simply
trying
to
demonstrate
that
one
cannot
solve
this
question
of
strict
scrutiny
by
merely
applying
the
labels
of
the
first
amendment
and
racial
discrimination.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
by
strict
scrutiny,
i
mean
that
when
this
court
considers
the
justifications,
it
must
look
at
them
with
great
care
first
of
all.
secondly,
i
think
the
court
should
be
far
more
reluctant
to
some
possible--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
think
that's
fair
characterizatio.
you
search
for
compelling
state
reasons
but
your
search
perhaps
starts
from
a
different
end
of
the
spectrum
when
you're
dealing
with
the
more
typical,
economic
regulation
case,
you
say,
is
there
any
conceivable
state
of
facts
and
if
the
court
may
think
of
one
that
even
if
counsel
has
thought
of
one,
you
set
that
forth.
here,
the
search
is
just
more
careful,
it's
more
thorough
and
that
any
possible
factual
situation
that
can
be
suggested
i
believe,
is
not
sufficient
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
if
as
i
believe
--
well
here,
there
has
been
some
purpose
suggested
but
supposing
the
appellants
had
not
suggested
any
purpose
at
all,
no
purpose
is
found
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
and
so
all
the
court
is
left
with
is
the
classification
itself
and
now
i'm
suggesting
that
whether
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
everyone
can
see
the
reason
for
the
classification,
well
then,
one
simply
has
to
examine
at
that
point
the
constitutionality
of
that
reasoning.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
which
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
do
you
mean
if
the
classification,
if
the
justification
is
offered
by
the
state?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
if
the
justification
is
offered
by
the
state
and
i
think
then
the
court
really
has
to
do
two
things.
first,
it
obviously
must
examine
that
classification
and
see
how
it
comports
with
the
constitutional
things
that
the
state
would
constitutionally
do.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
suggest
that
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
burden
is
reversed.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
the
court
must
examine
very
closely
and
should
be
less
prone
to
simply
justifying
the
statute
on
some
ground
which
no
party
is
offered
because
it
might
conceivably
justify
the
law.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes,
i
do
--
i
believe
it
does
mr.
justice
fortas
because
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
of
course
the
majority
opinion
was
commerce
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
can
burden
commerce
or
not
burden
commerce
in
that
sense.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
would
say
no.
the
congress
could
not
act
such
a
--
enact
such
a
law
not
because
of
any
lack
of
power
that
congress
has
under
the
commerce
clause
because
presumably,
that's
plenary
and
it
can
either
inhibit
it
or
it
can
remove
inhibitions
but
i
think
that
edwards
cuts
much
further,
it
clearly
cuts
much
further
in
the
opinions
of
four
concurring
justices.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
think
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
corresponding
limitation
of
power
in
the
part
of
both
congress
and
the
states
in
that
area.
now,
i
think
edwards
as
i
was
saying,
obviously,
in
the
opinions
of
the
four
concurring
justices
but
even
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
cuts
much
deeper
than
merely
a
syllogistic
commerce
case.
people
of
commerce,
the
commerce
is
burdened.
so
that's
the
ball
game.
there's
much
law
there,
there's
all
the
discussion
about
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
think
that
that
simply
must
be
described
in
terms
of
the
national
--
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
of
movement
which
this
court
has
discussed
in
numerous
cases.
it's
not
wholly
clear
exactly
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
may
stem
from
but
of
course
in
kent
in
that
factor
and
in
guest,
in
other
cases
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes.
now,
it
was
mentioned
earlier
that
of
course
it's
not
in
terms
of
first
amendment
right.
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
but
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
that
factor
did
refer
to
it
as
akin
to
the
first
amendment
right.
in
any
event,
it's
obviously
a
very
important
fundamental
right.
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
numerous
occasions.
now,
so
much
for
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
not
say
that
under
no
circumstance,
congress
would
have
this
power
--
would
not
have
this
power.
obviously,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
facts.
i'm
simply
emphasizing
that
there's
a
right
here.
there's
a
right
that
goes
out
against
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
state
government
and
of
course
we'll
have
to
take
the
cases
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
exactly.
now,
i
also
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
briefly
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
strict
scrutiny
and
it's
clearly
treated
in
our
brief
and
that
is
when
the
disadvantaged
minorities
necessarily
feel
the
brunt
of
a
case.
now,
it's
obviously
seen
here
as
a
factual
matter.
now,
in
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
some
minority
always
is
mr.
justice
white
but
it's
not
always
a
minority
of
this
character.
now,
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
griswold,
i
think
that
you
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i'm
sure
you
have
it.
in
your
concurring
opinion
of
course
in
griswold,
you
specifically
mentioned
the
fact
of
the
special
burden
of
the
connecticut
law
on
four
people
who
have
to
depend
on
birth
control
clinics
and
again,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
or
constitutional
for
this
reason.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
terms
of
approach,
this
is
a
very
important
thing
and
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
think
i
have
to
be
right
on
this
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
be
right
on
strict
scrutiny
at
all
but
it
obviously
helps
me
a
great
deal.
now,
i
think
the
effect
of
this
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
want
the
court
to
affirm.
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
the
statute,
of
course,
we
detail
in
our
brief
again,
the
obvious
effect
on
what
we
term
the
right
to
life
and
that's
a
little
bit
too
dramatic
in
most
cases
and
i
admit
it
probably
is
nonetheless
in
terms
of
family
breakup,
sending
the
children
off
to
junior
village
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
the
after
the
gloria
brown
and
minnie
harrell.
this
statute
has
disastrous
effects
quite
similar
i
think
to
the
sorts
of
rights
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
griswold
for
instance
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
family
unit
and
as
far
as
the
effect
of
this
case
the
statute
has
on
movement
and
association,
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i'm
not
talking
about
that
effect
which
may
resolve
when
the
person
say
in
georgia
is
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
will
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
says,
well,
there's
a
residence
law,
i
guess
i
won't
go.
therefore,
travel
is
inhibited.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
that
may
happen
and
may
not
happen.
i
think
it's
factual.
i
don't
know.
what
i'm
talking
about
and
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
is
that
the
statute
imposes
a
penalty
on
a
person's
movement
and
a
person's
association
because
it's
saying
to
this
person
we're
denying
you
the
statutory
right
of
public
assistance
which
is
statutory
right
across
the
board
for
the
particular
category,
solely
because
you've
recently
moved
and
also
of
course
in
two
of
these
cases
at
least,
the
state
might
as
well
have
said
solely
because
you
decide
to
move
because
you
wanted
to
associate
with
your
family
here
and
so
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
in
section
2
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
hope
that
we
adequately
distinguish
that
sort
of
requirement.
there
are
compelling
justifications,
the
familiarity
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
it's
not
just
automatic.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
and
again,
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief,
we're
not
saying
that
one,
penalty
is
imposed,
two,
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
that
reason.
i
believe
i
suggest
from
the
footnote
that
that
might
be
one
possible
way
of
looking
at
it.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
gets
us
back
to
the
discussion
of
who
is
the
resident.
now,
in
my
view
if
a
person
is
a
resident
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
and
he
had
every
intention
of
resigning
every
six
months,
i
say
he
should
get
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
think
he
is
a
resident
here
and
he
ought
to
get
the
money
and
incidentally,
hew
would
require
that
because
under
hew
regulations,
they
require
the
states
to
construe
residence.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
require
the
district
of
columbia
to
pay
it
while
he
is
here
and
i
require
the
other
state
to
pay
it
while
he
is
residing
there
and
i'd
require
some
other
state
to
pay
it
if
he
then
decides
that
he
prefers
to
live
in
maine.
now,
if
i
could
briefly
turn
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
and
really
clenching
point
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
justifications
and
i
think
it's
well
to
point
out
initially
that
when
you're
talking
about
justifications
and
searching
for
purposes,
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
on
allied
stores
versus
bowers,
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissenting
opinion
in
martin
v.
walton,
mr.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
griswold.
when
a
purpose
is
offered
up
by
the
state,
by
the
legislative
history
or
by
departing
defending
the
law,
that's
what
you
look
at
and
after
all,
that's
only
reasonable
because
that
is
really
the
purpose
why
the
law
was
passed
for
the
court
to
consider
some
completely
different
purpose
and
uphold
the
law
on
that
basis
within
some
respects,
required
the
court
to
consider
matters
of
legislative
wisdom
and
so
on,
which
the
legislature
never
has
in
which
presumably
legislators
should
do.
now
the
purpose
is
there's
no
secret
about
the
purposes
here.
they've
been
offered
up
and
i
might
say
that
there's
almost
been
some
gamesmanship
around
the
country
in
the
last
six
months
as
you
know
in
numerable
cases
that
have
been
brought.
who
can
think
of
a
purpose
to
defend
their
law
that
is
not
unconstitutional
under
the
edwards
case?
and
several
had
been
served
up.
now,
the
one
which,
although
there
is
no
legislative
history
on
the
matter
for
the
reasons
we
suggested
in
our
brief
of
the
one
that
is
obviously
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
law.
the
basis
for
passing
this
law
is
the
old
settlement
concept
which
changes
somewhat
in
this
country
and
became
residents
and
i
think
the
fact
that
there
isn't
any
legislative
history
and
we
trace
it
back
to
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
have
come
in
into
the
district
in
an
afdc
in
1926.
it's
because
this
is
just
the
way
it's
always
been
and
this
matter
of
the
history
has
been
very
carefully
treated
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
center
on
social
welfare
policy
and
law
in
their
first
appendix.
now,
this
purpose
is
asserted
by
the
state
and
it
really
--
there
are
two
branches
of
it
but
i
think
it
boils
down
the
same
thing.
one,
you
keep
out
paupers
and
the
other
you
save
money
and
of
course
you
don't
do
the
first
just
for
the
devil
of
it.
you
do
it
because
you're
interested
and
not
having
to
take
care
of
these
people.
and
i
think
one
that
that's
just
been
settled
by
edwards.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
that's
just
not
a
legitimate
consideration
for
the
state.
it
simply
cannot
serve
that
up.
california
had
far
more
problems
back
in
the
30s
as
the
court
acknowledged
in
its
opinion
and
i'm
sure
washington
dc
has.
but
you
just
can't
offer
that
and
furthermore
as
we
pointed
out,
it's
extremely
speculative.
in
fact
the
district
court
founds
a
fact
that
it's
just
wasn't
so.
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
marshaled
by
either
side
in
the
court
below
and
the
court
here,
i
think
quite
decisively
shows
that
there's
no
problem
along
this
line
in
any
event
in
terms
of
people
migrating
so
they
want
to
get
money.
now,
the
second
point
which
the
court
made
or
rather
the
appellant
made
here
to
justify
is
this
argument
of
an
objective
test
of
residence.
our
answer
to
that
is
it's
not
unconstitutional
per
se
such
as
the
objectives
in
terms
of
edwards
but
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
sweeps
far
too
broadly
and
when
basic
rights
were
involved,
the
court
has
simply
--
the
state
is
simply
going
to
have
to
find
something
that's
a
little
more
specific
and
deals
with
the
specific
problem
in
terms
of
funding
residence
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
difficulty
in
finding
residents.
after
all,
anyone
here
replies
entries
being
here
more
than
a
year
to
undergo
some
routine
check
and
he
says
that
he's
a
resident
but
presumably
the
state
has
to
check
that
out
too
and
they
all
get
their
checks
within
a
month
as
they
required
to
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
would
accept
the
state's
definition
of
residence
so
long
as
our
definition
was
constitutional.
now,
we
pointed
to
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
residence
in
the
district
for
me
isn't
what
they're
serving
up
here,
it's
not
an
objective
test
which
must
be
one
year.
you
have
to
pay
taxes
if
you've
been
here
on
the
31st
of
the
year
and
you're
a
resident
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
in
fact
the
highest
court
of
district
of
columbia
in
an
opinion
which
we
cite
in
our
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
what
i
would
accept
is
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
what
i
accept
on
the
judicial
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
accept
--
what
i
accept
are
the
judicial
opinions
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
define
residence
generally
as
varies
from
case
to
case
but
generally
a
person
who
is
physically
here
and
has
an
intention
to
remain.
now,
if
a
state
had
a
general
law
which
said
nobody
in
the
state
for
any
purposes
a
resident
unless
he's
been
here
a
year,
i
think
that
would
be
open
to
constitutional
attack
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
that's
the
only
reason
why
a
person
does
not
get
benefits.
so
i
don't
think
and
i
also
want
to
just
refer
the
court
to
its
opinion
in
harman
versus
forssenius,
the
virginia
toll
tax
case
which
i
think
is
clearly
this
positive
of
using
objective
test
of
residence
in
this
sense
because
that's
what
virginia
was
saying.
we
want
to
use
this
just
to
determine
objective
test
of
residence
and
the
court
referred
to
that
as
a
remote
administrative
benefit
which
wasn't
go
in
to
get
in
the
way
of
constitutional
rights.
now,
the
only
other
purpose
that
has
served
up
is
really
not
a
purpose
at
all
but
one
which
says
you
don't
have
to
have
any
purpose
and
that's
this
right
privilege
argument
that's
a
fortuity
and
so
the
court
can
sort
of
look
at
anyway
it
wants,
it
doesn't
have
to
have
a
purpose
and
i
think
that's
just
been
thoroughly
rejected
by
sherbert
versus
verner
and
it's
just
foreclosed
here.
there
are
other
purposes
that
had
been
offered
not
in
this
case
and
therefore
i
don't
think
the
court
can
look
at
it
and
i
believe
that
those
are
treated
particularly
in
pennsylvania's
brief
that
we
also
mentioned.
therefore,
i
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
deeply
mention
the
facts
in
this
case
if
i
may,
because
i
think
they
make
it
somewhat
easier
to
understand
some
of
the
legal
arguments.
there
were
four
appellees;
one
as
the
court
knows
recently
passed
away,
three
of
them,
all
but
one
vera
barley
who
was
residing
in
st.elizabeth's
hospital
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
from
arkansas,
new
york,
south
carolina
respectively
for
reasons
which
are
elaborated
in
some
details
in
the
complaints
and
in
the
affidavits
to
support
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
is
part
of
this
record
and
we
referred
to
them
extensively
our
case.
these
people
came
here
for
the
reasons
we
think
that
people
do
move.
mrs.
harold
came
here
because
she
was
ill
with
cancer
and
she
had
three
children
and
she
wanted
to
be
assured
that
her
brother
and
her
sister
could
take
care
of
those
children
if
something
happened
to
her.
ms.
brown
had
been
here
on
a
numerous
occasions
before
had
gone
to
school
here
and
was
returning
here
for
very
good
reasons
because
she
was
unable
to
live
in
fort
smith,
arkansas
anymore
because
she
was
not
eligible
for
public
housing.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
show
two
things.
first
of
all
the
record
very
clearly
show
why
the
appellees
here
moved
and
motivation
and
so
on
and
i
think
the
second
thing
they
show
is
the
typical
reasons
why
people
move.
they
move
to
be
with
family.
they
move
to
seek
employment
and
new
horizons.
i
think
those
facts
need
to
be
kept
in
mind
as
we
analyze
the
issues
here.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
none
of
them
moved
here
for
the
purpose
of
getting
public
aid
mr.
justice
black.
two
of
them
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
i
was
referring
to
the
families.
they
have
families
here
and
those
families
could
take
care
of
their
children
in
the
case
of
mrs.
harold.
she
was
ill
with
cancer
and
if
she
die,
she
wanted
to
know
that
there
was
a
family
here
who
could
then
take
care
of
her
children
and
she
had
a
brother
and
a
sister
here
and
so
it
was
important
for
her
to
move
here
for
that
reason.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
one
of
the
reasons
according
to
her
affidavit,
it's
proper
to
remove
but
only
one
reason,
was
that
her
mother
left
arkansas
for
oklahoma,
had
give
up
public
housing
so
she
had
no
place
to
live
and
so
there
she
was,
wondering
what
to
do
and
it's
a
very
logical
thing
for
her
to
come
to
new
horizon
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
she
have
family,
where
she
could
come
with
her
children
and
where
she
could
seek
a
better
life.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
suppose
she
knew
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
reflects
that
she
knew
what
sort
of
housing
she
would
get
here.
she
didn't
know
that
she
have
relatives
here
that
she
could
stay
with
and
of
course
she
did
for
14
months
until
she
later
found
housing.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
fundamentally,
it
does
not
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
seem
to
have
troubled
a
number
of
counsels
in
these
many
cases
and
i
think
a
number
of
judges
is
the
gut
feeling
that
one
has
that
people
are
running
around
the
country
seeking
to
gain
public
assistance
and
if
that
really
were
so,
i
don't
suggest
that
constitutional
issues
would
be
different
but
i
think
one
needs
to
recognize
that
that
sort
of
underlying
feeling
is
involved
when
we
look
at
these
issues
and
i
think
largely
it's
not
completely,
it's
unsupportable.
now,
the
theory
of
our
case
is
equal
protection.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
classifications
here
or
rather
a
classification
of
two
groups.
the
first,
anyone
who
has
lived
here
more
than
a
year
and
the
second,
anyone
who
has
lived
here
less
than
a
year
and
i
might
emphasize
--
mr.
barton
mentioned
this
fact
that
the
district
statute
is
quite
difficult
here.
as
far
as
i
know,
connecticut
has
the
only
statute
that
has
this
subclassification
--
the
district
of
pennsylvania
that
you'll
hear
about
shortly
and
that
all
of
the
others
are
just
straight
forward,
once
year
residence
requirements
is
a
very
clear
classification.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
are
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
parties?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
in
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
one
of
the
appellees
would
be
seeking
aid
of
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
that
is
vera
barley,
the
one
who
resided
in
st.
elizabeth's
hospital,
all
the
others
seek
afdc,
aid
for
dependent
children.
in
the
case
of
connecticut
and
in
case
of
--
i
believe
there
are
two
appellees
in
pennsylvania.
they
are
all
seeking
afdc.
so
the
exception
of
the
person
who
is
residing
in
st.
elizabeth's
who
of
course
would
not
be
eligible
for
afdc.
they
are
all
seeking
the
same
kind
of
aid.
now,
as
i
indicated
i
think
the
classification
in
the
two
groups
is
clear.
now,
this
court
of
course
has
annunciated
that
long
ago
what
the
applicable
test
for
equal
protection
are.
in
the
gulf
case
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
and
many
cases
since
mclaughlin
and
so
on.
the
court
has
indicated
that
a
statue
will
violate
equal
protection
either
because
of
the
classification
itself
must
fall
and
we're
not
suggesting
and
our
theory
is
not
bad
here
or
if
the
classification
does
not
per
se
unconstitutional
or
perhaps
this
may
only
be
suspect
as
in
the
many
cases.
it
must
be
reasonably
related
to
lawful
governmental
purpose
and
i
upsize
two
things.
one,
reasonably
related
and
the
second,
a
lawful
purpose
because
as
i
will
demonstrate
shortly,
it
is
we
believe
in
some
respects
not
reasonably
related
to
some
purposes
and
in
other
respects,
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
purpose
i
believe
but
i
think
that
purpose
is
clearly
unconstitutional
per
se
so
it
must
meet
those
two
tests.
now,
i
think
the
lines
are
fairly,
clearly
drawn
here
on
the
question
of
the
approach
of
this
court.
mr.
barton
has
conceded
of
course
that
if
the
court
would
adjudge
the
statute
and
understand
this
strict
scrutiny.
now,
our
contention
is
that
this
case
should
be
judged
by
those
standards
and
i
would
not
concede
at
all
that
we're
judged
under
any
standards,
it
would
fall
because
i
think
it's
going
to
be
clear
that
they're
just
on
any
lawful
objectives
at
all
that
it
has
been
offered
or
that
can
be
drained
up.
in
any
event,
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
standards
that
should
apply
here
when
this
court
used
this
case
are
those
strict
standards.
now,
reference
is
made
to
first
amendment
cases
and
a
reference
was
made
to
cases
involved
in
racial
discrimination
but
that
factor
doesn't
stop
there.
the
court
supplied
it
in
other
areas
many
years
ago
in
skinner
versus
oklahoma
involving
the
fundamental
rights
appropriation
did
not
involved
racial
discrimination
and
it
did
not
involve
the
first
amendment
right.
griswold
versus
connecticut
although
parts
of
it
might
be
said
to
stem
from
emanations
of
the
first
amendment
basically,
that's
not
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
griswold?
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
which
opinion
you
focus
on
there
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
have
intended
mainly
to
focus
on
the
majority
of
the
several
concurring
opinions
and
i
understand
you
to
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that's
right.
i
understand
you
mr.
justice
white
to
put
it
clearly
on
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
personally
feel
that
it's
a
fifth
amendment
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
feel
it
is
due
process.
i
feel
abstention
of
liberty
from
what
my
personal
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
it's
obvious
that
this
case
involved
peculiar
situations.
the
fundamental
rights
of
merits
and
so
on
which
you
eluded
to
and
which
a
number
of
the
other
opinions
eluded
to
and
of
course
harper
versus
board
of
elections.
there's
language
in
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
which
squarely
states
that
when
this
sort
of
a
classification
is
involved,
we
must
use
a
strict
scrutiny.
racial
discrimination?
first
amendment?
it
was
an
equal
protection
case.
now,
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
the
voting?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
was
a
voting
case
and
that's
correct
but
of
course
that's
not
a
first
amendment
case
and
it's
not
another
race
case.
i'm
simply
trying
to
demonstrate
that
one
cannot
solve
this
question
of
strict
scrutiny
by
merely
applying
the
labels
of
the
first
amendment
and
racial
discrimination.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
by
strict
scrutiny,
i
mean
that
when
this
court
considers
the
justifications,
it
must
look
at
them
with
great
care
first
of
all.
secondly,
i
think
the
court
should
be
far
more
reluctant
to
some
possible--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
think
that's
fair
characterizatio.
you
search
for
compelling
state
reasons
but
your
search
perhaps
starts
from
a
different
end
of
the
spectrum
when
you're
dealing
with
the
more
typical,
economic
regulation
case,
you
say,
is
there
any
conceivable
state
of
facts
and
if
the
court
may
think
of
one
that
even
if
counsel
has
thought
of
one,
you
set
that
forth.
here,
the
search
is
just
more
careful,
it's
more
thorough
and
that
any
possible
factual
situation
that
can
be
suggested
i
believe,
is
not
sufficient
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
if
as
i
believe
--
well
here,
there
has
been
some
purpose
suggested
but
supposing
the
appellants
had
not
suggested
any
purpose
at
all,
no
purpose
is
found
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
and
so
all
the
court
is
left
with
is
the
classification
itself
and
now
i'm
suggesting
that
whether
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
everyone
can
see
the
reason
for
the
classification,
well
then,
one
simply
has
to
examine
at
that
point
the
constitutionality
of
that
reasoning.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
which
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
do
you
mean
if
the
classification,
if
the
justification
is
offered
by
the
state?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
if
the
justification
is
offered
by
the
state
and
i
think
then
the
court
really
has
to
do
two
things.
first,
it
obviously
must
examine
that
classification
and
see
how
it
comports
with
the
constitutional
things
that
the
state
would
constitutionally
do.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
suggest
that
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
burden
is
reversed.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
the
court
must
examine
very
closely
and
should
be
less
prone
to
simply
justifying
the
statute
on
some
ground
which
no
party
is
offered
because
it
might
conceivably
justify
the
law.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes,
i
do
--
i
believe
it
does
mr.
justice
fortas
because
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
of
course
the
majority
opinion
was
commerce
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
can
burden
commerce
or
not
burden
commerce
in
that
sense.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
would
say
no.
the
congress
could
not
act
such
a
--
enact
such
a
law
not
because
of
any
lack
of
power
that
congress
has
under
the
commerce
clause
because
presumably,
that's
plenary
and
it
can
either
inhibit
it
or
it
can
remove
inhibitions
but
i
think
that
edwards
cuts
much
further,
it
clearly
cuts
much
further
in
the
opinions
of
four
concurring
justices.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
think
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
corresponding
limitation
of
power
in
the
part
of
both
congress
and
the
states
in
that
area.
now,
i
think
edwards
as
i
was
saying,
obviously,
in
the
opinions
of
the
four
concurring
justices
but
even
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
cuts
much
deeper
than
merely
a
syllogistic
commerce
case.
people
of
commerce,
the
commerce
is
burdened.
so
that's
the
ball
game.
there's
much
law
there,
there's
all
the
discussion
about
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
think
that
that
simply
must
be
described
in
terms
of
the
national
--
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
of
movement
which
this
court
has
discussed
in
numerous
cases.
it's
not
wholly
clear
exactly
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
may
stem
from
but
of
course
in
kent
in
that
factor
and
in
guest,
in
other
cases
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes.
now,
it
was
mentioned
earlier
that
of
course
it's
not
in
terms
of
first
amendment
right.
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
but
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
that
factor
did
refer
to
it
as
akin
to
the
first
amendment
right.
in
any
event,
it's
obviously
a
very
important
fundamental
right.
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
numerous
occasions.
now,
so
much
for
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
not
say
that
under
no
circumstance,
congress
would
have
this
power
--
would
not
have
this
power.
obviously,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
facts.
i'm
simply
emphasizing
that
there's
a
right
here.
there's
a
right
that
goes
out
against
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
state
government
and
of
course
we'll
have
to
take
the
cases
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
exactly.
now,
i
also
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
briefly
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
strict
scrutiny
and
it's
clearly
treated
in
our
brief
and
that
is
when
the
disadvantaged
minorities
necessarily
feel
the
brunt
of
a
case.
now,
it's
obviously
seen
here
as
a
factual
matter.
now,
in
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
some
minority
always
is
mr.
justice
white
but
it's
not
always
a
minority
of
this
character.
now,
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
griswold,
i
think
that
you
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i'm
sure
you
have
it.
in
your
concurring
opinion
of
course
in
griswold,
you
specifically
mentioned
the
fact
of
the
special
burden
of
the
connecticut
law
on
four
people
who
have
to
depend
on
birth
control
clinics
and
again,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
or
constitutional
for
this
reason.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
terms
of
approach,
this
is
a
very
important
thing
and
i
believe
in
the
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
pardon.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
don't
think
i
have
to
be
right
on
this
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
be
right
on
strict
scrutiny
at
all
but
it
obviously
helps
me
a
great
deal.
now,
i
think
the
effect
of
this
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
want
the
court
to
affirm.
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
the
statute,
of
course,
we
detail
in
our
brief
again,
the
obvious
effect
on
what
we
term
the
right
to
life
and
that's
a
little
bit
too
dramatic
in
most
cases
and
i
admit
it
probably
is
nonetheless
in
terms
of
family
breakup,
sending
the
children
off
to
junior
village
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
the
after
the
gloria
brown
and
minnie
harrell.
this
statute
has
disastrous
effects
quite
similar
i
think
to
the
sorts
of
rights
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
griswold
for
instance
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
family
unit
and
as
far
as
the
effect
of
this
case
the
statute
has
on
movement
and
association,
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i'm
not
talking
about
that
effect
which
may
resolve
when
the
person
say
in
georgia
is
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
will
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
says,
well,
there's
a
residence
law,
i
guess
i
won't
go.
therefore,
travel
is
inhibited.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
that
may
happen
and
may
not
happen.
i
think
it's
factual.
i
don't
know.
what
i'm
talking
about
and
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
is
that
the
statute
imposes
a
penalty
on
a
person's
movement
and
a
person's
association
because
it's
saying
to
this
person
we're
denying
you
the
statutory
right
of
public
assistance
which
is
statutory
right
across
the
board
for
the
particular
category,
solely
because
you've
recently
moved
and
also
of
course
in
two
of
these
cases
at
least,
the
state
might
as
well
have
said
solely
because
you
decide
to
move
because
you
wanted
to
associate
with
your
family
here
and
so
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
in
section
2
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
hope
that
we
adequately
distinguish
that
sort
of
requirement.
there
are
compelling
justifications,
the
familiarity
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
it's
not
just
automatic.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
and
again,
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief,
we're
not
saying
that
one,
penalty
is
imposed,
two,
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
that
reason.
i
believe
i
suggest
from
the
footnote
that
that
might
be
one
possible
way
of
looking
at
it.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
gets
us
back
to
the
discussion
of
who
is
the
resident.
now,
in
my
view
if
a
person
is
a
resident
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
and
he
had
every
intention
of
resigning
every
six
months,
i
say
he
should
get
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
think
he
is
a
resident
here
and
he
ought
to
get
the
money
and
incidentally,
hew
would
require
that
because
under
hew
regulations,
they
require
the
states
to
construe
residence.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
require
the
district
of
columbia
to
pay
it
while
he
is
here
and
i
require
the
other
state
to
pay
it
while
he
is
residing
there
and
i'd
require
some
other
state
to
pay
it
if
he
then
decides
that
he
prefers
to
live
in
maine.
now,
if
i
could
briefly
turn
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
and
really
clenching
point
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
justifications
and
i
think
it's
well
to
point
out
initially
that
when
you're
talking
about
justifications
and
searching
for
purposes,
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
on
allied
stores
versus
bowers,
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissenting
opinion
in
martin
v.
walton,
mr.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
griswold.
when
a
purpose
is
offered
up
by
the
state,
by
the
legislative
history
or
by
departing
defending
the
law,
that's
what
you
look
at
and
after
all,
that's
only
reasonable
because
that
is
really
the
purpose
why
the
law
was
passed
for
the
court
to
consider
some
completely
different
purpose
and
uphold
the
law
on
that
basis
within
some
respects,
required
the
court
to
consider
matters
of
legislative
wisdom
and
so
on,
which
the
legislature
never
has
in
which
presumably
legislators
should
do.
now
the
purpose
is
there's
no
secret
about
the
purposes
here.
they've
been
offered
up
and
i
might
say
that
there's
almost
been
some
gamesmanship
around
the
country
in
the
last
six
months
as
you
know
in
numerable
cases
that
have
been
brought.
who
can
think
of
a
purpose
to
defend
their
law
that
is
not
unconstitutional
under
the
edwards
case?
and
several
had
been
served
up.
now,
the
one
which,
although
there
is
no
legislative
history
on
the
matter
for
the
reasons
we
suggested
in
our
brief
of
the
one
that
is
obviously
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
law.
the
basis
for
passing
this
law
is
the
old
settlement
concept
which
changes
somewhat
in
this
country
and
became
residents
and
i
think
the
fact
that
there
isn't
any
legislative
history
and
we
trace
it
back
to
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
have
come
in
into
the
district
in
an
afdc
in
1926.
it's
because
this
is
just
the
way
it's
always
been
and
this
matter
of
the
history
has
been
very
carefully
treated
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
center
on
social
welfare
policy
and
law
in
their
first
appendix.
now,
this
purpose
is
asserted
by
the
state
and
it
really
--
there
are
two
branches
of
it
but
i
think
it
boils
down
the
same
thing.
one,
you
keep
out
paupers
and
the
other
you
save
money
and
of
course
you
don't
do
the
first
just
for
the
devil
of
it.
you
do
it
because
you're
interested
and
not
having
to
take
care
of
these
people.
and
i
think
one
that
that's
just
been
settled
by
edwards.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
that's
just
not
a
legitimate
consideration
for
the
state.
it
simply
cannot
serve
that
up.
california
had
far
more
problems
back
in
the
30s
as
the
court
acknowledged
in
its
opinion
and
i'm
sure
washington
dc
has.
but
you
just
can't
offer
that
and
furthermore
as
we
pointed
out,
it's
extremely
speculative.
in
fact
the
district
court
founds
a
fact
that
it's
just
wasn't
so.
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
marshaled
by
either
side
in
the
court
below
and
the
court
here,
i
think
quite
decisively
shows
that
there's
no
problem
along
this
line
in
any
event
in
terms
of
people
migrating
so
they
want
to
get
money.
now,
the
second
point
which
the
court
made
or
rather
the
appellant
made
here
to
justify
is
this
argument
of
an
objective
test
of
residence.
our
answer
to
that
is
it's
not
unconstitutional
per
se
such
as
the
objectives
in
terms
of
edwards
but
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
sweeps
far
too
broadly
and
when
basic
rights
were
involved,
the
court
has
simply
--
the
state
is
simply
going
to
have
to
find
something
that's
a
little
more
specific
and
deals
with
the
specific
problem
in
terms
of
funding
residence
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
difficulty
in
finding
residents.
after
all,
anyone
here
replies
entries
being
here
more
than
a
year
to
undergo
some
routine
check
and
he
says
that
he's
a
resident
but
presumably
the
state
has
to
check
that
out
too
and
they
all
get
their
checks
within
a
month
as
they
required
to
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
i
would
accept
the
state's
definition
of
residence
so
long
as
our
definition
was
constitutional.
now,
we
pointed
to
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
residence
in
the
district
for
me
isn't
what
they're
serving
up
here,
it's
not
an
objective
test
which
must
be
one
year.
you
have
to
pay
taxes
if
you've
been
here
on
the
31st
of
the
year
and
you're
a
resident
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
in
fact
the
highest
court
of
district
of
columbia
in
an
opinion
which
we
cite
in
our
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
what
i
would
accept
is
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
what
i
accept
on
the
judicial
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
accept
--
what
i
accept
are
the
judicial
opinions
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
define
residence
generally
as
varies
from
case
to
case
but
generally
a
person
who
is
physically
here
and
has
an
intention
to
remain.
now,
if
a
state
had
a
general
law
which
said
nobody
in
the
state
for
any
purposes
a
resident
unless
he's
been
here
a
year,
i
think
that
would
be
open
to
constitutional
attack
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
that's
the
only
reason
why
a
person
does
not
get
benefits.
so
i
don't
think
and
i
also
want
to
just
refer
the
court
to
its
opinion
in
harman
versus
forssenius,
the
virginia
toll
tax
case
which
i
think
is
clearly
this
positive
of
using
objective
test
of
residence
in
this
sense
because
that's
what
virginia
was
saying.
we
want
to
use
this
just
to
determine
objective
test
of
residence
and
the
court
referred
to
that
as
a
remote
administrative
benefit
which
wasn't
go
in
to
get
in
the
way
of
constitutional
rights.
now,
the
only
other
purpose
that
has
served
up
is
really
not
a
purpose
at
all
but
one
which
says
you
don't
have
to
have
any
purpose
and
that's
this
right
privilege
argument
that's
a
fortuity
and
so
the
court
can
sort
of
look
at
anyway
it
wants,
it
doesn't
have
to
have
a
purpose
and
i
think
that's
just
been
thoroughly
rejected
by
sherbert
versus
verner
and
it's
just
foreclosed
here.
there
are
other
purposes
that
had
been
offered
not
in
this
case
and
therefore
i
don't
think
the
court
can
look
at
it
and
i
believe
that
those
are
treated
particularly
in
pennsylvania's
brief
that
we
also
mentioned.
therefore,
i
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
