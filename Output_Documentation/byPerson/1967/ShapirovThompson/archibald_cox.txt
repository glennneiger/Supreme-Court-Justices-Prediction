mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
there
are
other
arguments
presented
in
our
briefs,
i
suggest
that
in
the
final
analysis,
the
decisions
below
can
most
simply
and
should
be
affirmed
upon
the
very
familiar
principle
that
a
legislative
classification
which
discriminates
without
justification
against
those
who
exercise
a
fundamental
constitutional
liberty
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
certainly
applies
to
the
granted
benefits
and
privileges
as
well
as
to
regulation
or
taxation.
the
one-year
residence
requirement
here
and
connecticut's
requirement
also
divides
mothers
and
children
who
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
their
need,
their
desires,
and
in
every
other
conceivably
relevant
way
into
two
classes,
all
residents
who
are
granted
the
benefit
and
newer
residents
who
are
denied.
and
the
discrimination
operates
in
relation
to
the
most
fundamental
necessities,
the
very
rudiments
of
life.
the
classification
rest
not
only
on
an
invidious
distinction
against
newcomers
or
strangers
but
it
singles
out
as
the
sole
ground
for
that
hospital
treatment
the
exercise
of
a
long-recognized
constitutional
liberty
to
leave
one
residence
and
to
move
to
another
in
the
search
of
better
opportunities,
better
associations,
and
better
environment,
a
privilege
which
has
been
fundamental
relics
of
this
country's
whole
existence.
finally,
i
shall
show
that
if
one
examines
the
alleged
justifications
for
this
discrimination
which
is
prima
facie
invidious
for
the
reason
that
i
have
stated.
he
finds
that
none
of
them
will
stand
careful
examination
because
none
of
them
are
reasonably
related
to
any
of
the
permissible
or
legitimate
object
of
state
policy.
before
elaborating
those
propositions
which
are
the
heart
of
the
cases
i
proposed
to
argue
with,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
go
back
and
put
the
issue
in
its
proper
statutory
and
factual
background.
historically,
as
the
brief
for
the
center
of
study
of
welfare
policy
and
law
finds
out.
historically,
public
assistance
laws
go
back
to
the
elizabethan
poor
laws
if
not
earlier.
and
as
the
amicus
brief
traces
it
down
in
this
deed
as
this
court
did
in
edwards
and
california
and
then
the
chief
justices
raised
an
opinion
in
king
and
smith.
there
was,
at
that
time
in
an
age
when
many
of
the
idea
still
derived
from
feudalism
and
then
in
an
age
when
most
people
certainly
ordinary
poor
people
were
not
very
mobile,
a
notion
that
each
vicinage
should
take
care
of
what
mrs.
williams
calls
“our
people”
of
those
who
are
settled
in,
and
that
it
had
no
obligation
to
those
strangers,
those
outsiders
who
come
from
someone
else,
somewhere
else,
and
whom
we
don't
quite
know,
and
we
don't
quite
trust,
and
we
don't
quite
like,
and
we
don't
have
any
obligation
to.
now,
in
the
present
century
when
matters
as
pension
laws
and
other
forms
and
social
assistance
began
to
be
adapted
in
this
country,
the
combination
of
this
anachronistic
idea
plus
a
continuing
hostility
to
distrust
for
poor
strangers.plus,
i
suspect
an
opposition
to
making
any
larger
expenditure
as
then
you
could
possibly
withheld,
combined
to
produce
in
the
early
statutes
extraordinarily
strict
length
of
residence
or
prior
residence
requirements.
for
mothers
aid
many
states
had
laws
requiring
four
or
five-year
residence.
for
old
age,
the
requirements
in
various
states
run
up
to
15,
20,
in
the
one
state
even
35
years
prior
residence.
and
that
was
the
situation
when
congress
considered
the
social
security
act
in
1935.
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
statute
provided
for
federal
contributions
to
approve
state
plans
in
a
number
of
categories
of
assistance
the
most
important
being
aid
to
dependent
children
and
that's
clearly
the
most
important
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged
and
later
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
congress
was
faced
by
this
duration
of
residence
requirements
and
concluded
that
they
were
objectionably
long.
and
with
respect
to
each
category
of
assistance,
it
imposed
a
limit
and
the
duration
of
residence
that
the
state
might
impose
or
might
require.
taking
as
an
example,
the
adc
program,
we
quote
in
page
39
of
our
brief
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act.
and
when
i
say
“our
brief”
i
mean
our
supplemental
brief.
the
administrator
shall
approve
any
plan
which
fulfills
the
conditions
specified
in
subsection
a,
accept
that
he
shall
not
approve
any
plan
which
imposes
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
aid
to
dependent
children.
a
residence
requirement
which
denies
aid
with
respect
to
any
child
residing
in
the
state,
who
has
resided
there
for
one
year
who
are
--
who
was
born
within
the
preceding
year
if
the
parent
had
resided
there
for
one
year.
now,
our
view
is
that
the
role
of
section
402
(b)
was
to
outlaw
residence
requirements
of
more
than
one
year
leaving
the
situation
with
respect
to
residence
requirement
of
a
year
or
less
exactly
where
congress
found
it.
it
said
that
more
than
a
year
is
bad
and
it
said
nothing
about
the
rest,
one
way
or
other.
this,
i
submit,
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
form
of
the
statute
and
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
that
was
to
set
minimum
requirements
and
then
leave
the
rest
to
the
states.
now,
i
stress
the
point
because
it
means,
of
course,
that
the
courts
below
were
right
in
very
largely
ignoring
section
402(b).
it
drops
out
of
the
case
for
two
reasons,
first,
if
congress
didn't
express
any
judgment
on
residence
requirements
for
less
than
a
year,
then
certainly
there
is
no
question
of
the
judiciary
differing
to
the
legislative
judgment
the
congressional
judgment
that
a
residence
requirement
of
one
year
is
a
good
thing.
congress
didn't
have
to
address
itself
to
them
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
have
expressed
any
such
judgment.
second,
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
worry
about
invalidating
any
provision
of
the
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
that
directs
the
secretary
of
hew
to
approve
a
plan
which
includes
a
discrimination
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
no
i
think
--
i
think
not
because
i
think
congress
wasn't
really
addressing
it
to
the
south,
to
the
question
whether
it
is
our
judgment
that
these
are
not
inconsistent.
but
when
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
the
commerce
clause,
it
was
simply
saying
we
don't
say
anything
about
it.
but
of
course
on
the
approach
that
i
stated
at
the
outset,
and
i
think
each
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
approach
that
i
have
stated
at
the
outset,
one
doesn't
have
to
concern
himself
with
that
question
because
one
comes
back
and
pitches
this
case
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
--
i
don't
like
to
call
it
the
right
to
travel
because
it's
the
right
to
migrate
and
settle
in
a
new
place
and
to
seek
new
advantages
not
just
to
move
around
are
important
because
they
show
that
this
is
an
affirmative
constitutional
value.
but
we
are
not
concern.
was
there
more
technical
scope
or
with
that
--
just
what
body
they
apply
to
or
just
what
technically
is
the
source
the
right.
i
should
remind
the
court
as
we
might
have
in
our
brief
that
the
administrator
of
social
security
and
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health
education
welfare
has
often
refused
to
approve
state
plans
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
substantive
sense
not
because
he
concluded
they
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
necessarily
or
establishing
other
inequitable
classifications.
but
two
examples
have
come
quickly
to
mind
are
his
disapproval
of
a
plan,
which
would
have
excluded
indians
and
children
of
indians,
and
his
disapproval
of
a
plan
that
would
have
excluded
illegitimate
children.
both
of
those
under
the
equitable
classification
law
were
disapproved
by
the
secretary
even
though
they're
not
expressly
mentioned
in
section
402.
and
surely,
that
same
power
applies
to
giving
effect
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
eligibility.
i
add,
although
i
hope
it's
not
necessary,
that
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
reading
of
section
402(b),
then
of
course
we
say
that
section
402(b)
is
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason
that
we
say
that
the
state
laws
and
the
special
statute
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
thought
it
brought
up
to
bare,
justice
harlan,
only
to
the
point
of
saying
it's
not
so
bad
that
we
are
going
to
strike
it
down.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
quite
different
from
what
a
legislative
body
does
when
it
brings
its
judgment
to
bare
on
the
question
and
say,
“we
are
going
to
impose
this.”
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
excuse
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
you
were
saying
something
different
then
you
were
--
of
course
congress
brought
it's
quite
--
i
wouldn't
deny
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course
it
is.
i'm
very
sorry.
under
section
402(b)
which
i
certainly
can't
argue
outlaws
the
one-year
residence
requirement.
about
40
states
have
enacted
one-year
residence
requirements.
other
states
including
new
york,
rhode
island,
and
today
massachusetts,
maine,
hawaii,
and
a
few
others,
do
not
have
a
residence
requirement.
a
typical
residence
requirement
is
found
in
the
--
is
the
one
in
the
pennsylvania
case
which
you
will
find
on
page
1a
of
the
pennsylvania
brief.
it
provides
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“assistance
may
be
granted
only
to
or
on
behalf
of
a
person
residing
in
pennsylvania
which
resided
therein
for
at
least
one
year
preceding
the
date
of
application
or
who
has
resided
in
a
state
with
which
pennsylvania
has
a
reciprocal
agreement
making
residence
unnecessary.
i
mentioned
they
are
because
i
come
back
to
the
significance
of
that
alternative
later.
i
think
it
has
a
good
deal
of
bearing
on
what
are
the
purposes
of
this
legislature.
the
operation
of
the
statute
in
pennsylvania,
but
also
it
will
serve
for
other
cases,
is
illustrated
by
its
application
to
the
plaintiff
juanita
smith.
juanita
smith
lived
in
pennsylvania
with
a
family,
with
a
mother
and
father
who
had
lived
there
all
their
lives
forbearance
who
had
lived
there
earlier.
from
the
time
she
was
one
month
old
until
she
must
been
around
16
or
17,
until
she
was
old
enough
to
bare
children,
she
then
went
to
delaware
with
a
man
named
peter
where
they
lived
for
a
few
years.
she
came
back
with
five
children.
at
the
invitation
of
her
father
who
had
promised
to
help
--
help
peter
to
get
a
job
and
to
help
the
family
out
until
peter
did
get
a
job.
so
this
was
a
very,
in
a
real
sense,
a
matter
of
going
back
home
if
i
may
use
home
colloquially
in
the
family
sense
or
rather
than
in
any
technical
sense
of
domicile.
it
was
rejoining
the
family
and
going
to
the
family
to
get
help.
unfortunately,
peter
didn't
get
a
job
and
went
back
to
delaware
then
when
juanita
smith's
father
lost
his
job,
he
couldn't
take
care
of
her
and
the
five
children
anymore.
she
was
pregnant,
sick
with
a
very
bad
varicose
problem,
and
she
went
to
the
welfare
people.
the
welfare
people,
because
of
the
residence
requirement
had
no
solution.
the
only
thing
they
could
say
was,
“we'll
either
go
back
to
delaware,”
because
she
didn't
want
to
leave
her
family.
she
didn't
want
to
go
back
to
delaware
for
other
reasons.
or,
we'll
take
your
children
away
from
you
and
provide
institutional
care
which
might
run
anywhere
from
six
months
to
two
years.
and
this
at
least
will
provide
them
with
shelter.
but
there's
nothing
else
under
the
residence
requirement
we
--
they
could
do.
ms.
smith
was
taken
care
of
by
the
travelers
aid
society
which
agreed
to
provide
a
modicum
of
means
until
this
test
litigation
could
be
brought.
the
three
judge
district
court
granted
first
a
temporary
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
residence
requirement
which
then
did
provide
the
necessary
aid.
that
injunction
as
the
court
knows
was
later
made
permanent
and
the
cases
here.
the
decision
below,
i
may
recall,
rested
primarily
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
would
also
emphasize
that
the
decision
in
the
pennsylvania
district
court
was
one
of
far
there
are
many
decisions
by
three
judge
district
courts
all
over
the
country.
there
are
at
least
five
major
opinions
and
decisions
where
the
court
seems
genuinely
to
have
considered
the
case
itself
in
the
last
and
since
the
argument
in
this
case
in
the
opinion
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
in
the
court
which
circuit
judge
aldridge
presided
over.
there
are
also
a
raft
of
temporary
orders
which
i
don't
think
i
can
really
claim
as
authority
because
they
just
followed
what
had
happened
before.
but
nevertheless,
with
the
exception
of
one
case
there's
been
an
extraordinary
uniformity
of
opinions
to
which
i
think
this
court
would
wish
to
give
weigh.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
is
a
little
bit
different
from
that
of
pennsylvania
and
i
want
to
explain
some
of
the
idiosyncrasies
in
its
operation.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
appears
on
page
2
of
the
fattest
of
the
briefs,
the
first
brief
for
the
appellees
in
these
cases.
public
assistance
shall
be
awarded
to
or
on
behalf
of
any
needy
individual
who
either
(a)
has
resided
in
the
district
for
one
year
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
filing
his
application
for
such
assistance,
or
(b)
who
was
born
with
one
--
one
year
immediately
preceding
the
application
for
such
aid,
if
the
parent
or
other
relative
with
whom
the
child
is
living
has
lived
in
the
district
for
a
year.
three
of
the
four
plaintiffs
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
fall
into
the
familiar
--
if
one
is
familiar
with
these
cases'
pattern
illustrated
by
juanita
smith
of
whom
i
spoke
earlier.
that
is
to
say
they
are
mothers
of
dependent
children
without
present
husbands
who
moved
into
the
new
jurisdiction
either
to
go
back
home
for
the
most
part
or
rejoin
their
families
or
to
get
help
from
some
person
or
perhaps
to
get
a
job
and
then
who
are
left
absolutely
destitute
of
when
misfortune
occurs.
two
of
the
district
cases
show
the
--
what
i
call
the
idiosyncrasies
of
this
statute.
one
is
the
case
of
gloria
jean
brown
for
the
most
part
her
saga
is
like
that
of
juanita
smith
that
is
to
say
she
grew
up
in
washington
dc.
she
went
out
of
state
with
children
and
then
she
came
back
to
a
large
family.
i
mean
her
father
and
brothers
insisted
which
was
here.
when
she
was
coming
back,
she
left
the
two
children
she
had
taken
with
her
to
arkansas
there
for
a
month
or
two
while
she
came
back
and
reestablish
empennage
in
which
to
bring
them
up.
then
when
she
found
she
had
to
apply
for
assistance
and
when
her
oldest
child
who
was
here
and
she
both
receive
assistance
under
the
one-year
residence
law,
these
other
two
in
the
same
family
who
certainly
were
in
the
same
situation
and
who
certainly
have
the
same
ties
to
the
district
of
columbia
when
she
did,
were
denied
the
assistance
that
was
given
to
the
oldest
child.
and
the
--
worse
than
that,
the
little
baby
in
the
family
not
being
a
year-old
hadn't
resided
in
the
district
for
a
year
so
it
will
--
too
was
held
not
to
have
the
same
connection
as
its
mother
and
older
brother.
really
still
my
idiosyncratic
was
the
case
which
i
understood
counsel
just
to
withdraw
the
case
of
vera
barley
who
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
even
if
they
have
conceded
in
this,
it
shows
the
operation
of
these
laws
who
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
1943
and
she
was
coming
back
to
a
place
where
she
lived
before
so
not
for
very
long
even
then.
she
had
the
misfortune
to
become
incompetent.
she
was
confined
to
st.
elizabeth's.
she
was
in
st.
elizabeth's
for
29
years.
if
public
assistance
could
be
provided
to
her,
she
was
determined
by
the
doctors
to
be
competent
to
be
released
and
arrangements
were
made
to
--
for
her
living
in
a
nursing
home
here.
but
the
district
said
no,
she
hadn't
one
year's
residence,
so
she
had
to
stay
in
st.
elizabeth's.
a
good
deal
has
been
said
about
saving
money
in
these
cases.
it
costs
roughly
three
times
as
much
to
keep
her
in
st.
elizabeth
as
it
would've
kept
to
provide
the
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
let
her
go
to
a
home.
i
may
say
that
that
is
also
true
of
many
of
these
children
for
whom
the
only
future
under
the
one-year
residence
rule
was
going
to
institutional
care,
which
is
more
expensive
per
child
on
the
average
than
the
aid
under
the
adc
programs.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recall
that
being
stated
and
argued
as
a
general
matter.
but
we
do
not,
as
i
understand
it.
i
have
checked
this
afternoon.
but
i
believe
we
have
no
reliable
figures
indeed
no
figures
at
all
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
argument
--
the
argument
that
i
make,
i
would
remind
your
honor,
is
composed
of
three
parts.
one
is
the
discrimination
and
the
other
is
discrimination
aimed
at
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right
--
liberty,
the
liberty
of
travel,
and
three,
the
absence
of
any
justification
in
state
policy.
i
think
a
much
stronger
case
can
be
made
for
requiring
a
period
of
residence
in
a
state,
but
before
you're
permitted
to
take
part
in
its
affairs,
that
you
learn
what
the
issues
are,
learn
something
about
the
nature
of
the
community
or
learn
something
about
the
parties,
candidates
and
their
past
record.
therefore,
i
would
think
it
was
a
much
stronger
basis
for
arguing.
in
that
case,
that
the
differentiation
between
old
and
new
residence
serves
a
useful
purpose.
i
shall
argue
here
taking
them
up
one
at
a
time
that
none
of
the
justifications
advanced
for
this
statute.
stand
up
that
this
differentiation
not
only
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
is
discourages,
penalizes
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
liberty,
freedom
of
movement,
but
that
it
lacks
that
justification.
that
would
be
my
--
i
think
--
in
other
words,
each
residence
requirement
must
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
what
--
is
there
some
reasonable
basis?
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
your
voting
case
for
that
reason
is
quite
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
we're
--
you're
quite
right
and
i
stated
it,
i
think,
the
way
i
meant
to
in
the
beginning
that
this
divides
residence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
within
the
hew
definition
that
your
honor
referred
to
earlier
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
into
two
categories
and
that
we
say
is
the
invidious
classification.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
in
the
case
of
the
other
requirements
for
eligibility,
yes
precisely.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
connecticut
statute
very
briefly.
connecticut
statute
on
page
36
of
the
connecticut
brief
is
a
little
bit
different
from
the
pennsylvanian
district
statutes.
and
the
difference
is
worth
noticing
along
with
one
matter
of
fact.
the
connecticut
statute
is
the
very
last
page
in
the
brief
in
the
connecticut
case.
when
any
person
comes
into
this
state
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future
and
applies
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future,
and
applies
for
aid
to
dependent
children,
you'll
notice
this
applies
only
to
afdc
and
not
to
other
categories
of
the
system.
within
one
year
from
his
arrival,
such
person
shall
be
eligible
only
for
temporary
aid
or
care
until
arrangements
are
made
for
his
return.
under
the
regulations
of
the
connecticut
welfare
department,
the
requirement
of
visible
means
of
support
are
means
that
you
must
either
have
a
specific
job
offer
or
resources,
money
or
property
that
will
last
you
for
three
months.
or,
if
you're
able
to
get
and
keep
a
job
for
three
months,
that
too
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
now,
i
do
not
intend
to
go
into
the
case
of
the
connecticut
plaintiff
in
any
detail.
i
do
want
to
say
just
one
thing
and
that
is
that
it
was
clearly
stipulated.
it's
on
page
41a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
appellant.
because
of
her
pregnancy
and
her
responsibilities
to
her
son,
the
plaintiff
was
unable
to
seek
--
either
to
seek
gainful
employment
or
enroll
in
a
work
training
program.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
most
misplaced
in
this
case
to
talk
about
people
who
are
unwilling
to
enter
the
labor
force.
this
is
a
plaintiff,
who
at
the
time
when
this
claim
was
made,
was
unable
because
of
her
pregnancy
and
her
responsibilities
to
her
son
to
enter
the
workforce
or
seek
training.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
number
of
the
states
will
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
number
of
the
states
will
supply
aid
if
you
go
back
home
and
indeed
in
--
or
if
the
court
should
direct
itself
to
the
question,
“how
far
does
this
deter
taking
up
a
new
residence
as
distinguished
from
how
far
does
it
penalize
one
who
insist
on
doing
it
which
i
don't
think
is
important?”
but
should
one
go
into
that,
it's
significant
that
this
puts
pressure
on
people
to
go
back
to
the
other
state
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
connecticut
record,
i'm
afraid
i
have
forgotten
the
figure,
that
a
certain
number
of
people,
when
confronted
with
this
at
the
initial
interview,
having
nothing
else
to
do
or
being
destitute
are
in
effect
pressed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
to
go
back
where
they
came.
and
this,
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
it
was
true
of
all
states,
justice
fortas,
but
it's
a
characteristic
of
many
of
these
programs.
in
coming
back
now
to
my
legal
propositions,
i
shall
direct
myself
first
to
the
unqualified
one
year
prior
residence
requirement
and
then
deal
with
any
peculiarities
of
the
connecticut
case
further
on.
we
picture
our
case
ultimately,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
upon
the
preposition
that
the
one
year's
prior
residence
requirement
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
because
without
any
justification,
say
a
prejudice
against
strangers,
against
new
residence
who
are
poor,
it
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
between
two
groups
of
persons
who
are
otherwise
identically
situated,
let's
say
that
one
of
them
has
chosen
recently
to
exercise
the
fundamental
liberty
to
leave
an
old
environment
and
move
to
a
new
residence
in
search
of
preferred
associations,
opportunities
or
environment.
i
--
i
would
emphasize
that
that
proposition
embraces
three
elements.
first,
that
the
one
year
residence
requirement
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
between
two
classes
of
persons
who
are
identically
situated
in
terms
of
need
or
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
that
is
offered
or
any
other
thing
of
that
kind,
say
how
long
they've
been
there
or
where
they
came
from.
second,
the
sole
basis
of
classification
is
a
differentiation
between
the
new
and
the
old
residence
would
be
all
granted
assistance
and
the
new
denied.
that
discrimination
against
strangers,
against
new
comers,
against
those
who,
mrs.
williams
said
during
her
oral
argument
“are
not
our
people”
which
i
think,
with
no
offense
at
all
to
her
intent,
reveals
that
this
sort
of
rest
on
a
prejudice
against
the
outsiders.
it's
invidious
in
that
sense
like
racial
or
religious
discrimination.
but
it
also
penalizes
the
exercise
of
a,
what
i
take
to
be,
a
liberty
of
freedom
and
aspect
of
freedom
which
has
long
constitutional
recognition.
and
then,
the
third
element
is
that
the
classification
serves
as
no
substantial
relation
to
the
accomplishment
of
any
permissible
state
policy.
under
the
grab
bag
of
justifications
that
the
appellants
put
forward
here
in
their
briefs,
most
of
them,
testimony
to
the
ingenuity
of
counsel,
i
think
it'd
be
shown
really
not
to
stand
up
on
any
careful
analysis.
now,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
this
or
i
think
one
could
argue
that
we
do
argue
in
some
of
our
briefs
that
perhaps
someone
or
two
of
those
three
elements
in
the
case
would
be
enough
to
make
account
a
case
for
unconstitutionality.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
don't
need
to
go
that
far,
that
all
we
need
to
say
is
that
adding
all
three
together,
the
one
year's
prior
residence
requirement
is
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
then
we
developed
each
of
the
three
parts.
but
preliminarily,
i
ought
to
say
that
of
course
the
constitutional
guarantees
against
hostile
or
arbitrary
and
capricious
classifications
apply
to
legislation
conferring
advantages
or
opportunities
or
privileges
just
as
much
as
they
do
to
legislation
that
regulates
our
taxes.
the
obvious
example
would
be
a
state
granted
aid
program
that
discriminated
down
grounds
of
race
or
that
discriminated
down
grounds
of
religion
as
in
sherbert
and
verner.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
which
if
you
read
them
carefully
sustained
this
--
this
proposition
of
the
gerard
college
case
of
evans
and
milton,
simkins
and
moses
cone,
a
fourth
circuit
case
when
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
and
again
the
sherbert
and
verner.
i
think
all
show
that
there
is
nothing
new
in
this
suggestion.
now
on
the
first
of
the
three
elements,
we
suggest,
as
i
say,
that
the
one
year
prior
residence
rule
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
minimum
essentials
of
life
between
persons
who
are
identically
situated
except
for
their
residence.
the
proposition
is
perfectly
simple
and
i
don't
think
anyone
is
going
to
dispute
it.
but
quite
frankly,
i'm
a
--
a
little
worried
that
because
of
its
simplicity,
its
importance
make
it
overlooked.
that's
one
reason
i
stressed
the
facts
that
this
is
a
discrimination
in
regard
between
people
who
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
just
taking
them
one
at
a
time.
i
--
i
emphasize
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
like
to
dispose
of
a
couple
of
little
points.
first
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
all
classifications
are
invalid.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
is
not
--
i'm
suggesting
really
two
things
and
perhaps
i
didn't
state
them
very
well.
i'll
try
to
do
it
more
simply.
i'm
suggesting
that
this
isn't
a
discrimination
or
like
one
or
between
the
business
that
may
claim
it's
entitled
to
a
subsidy
for
$5
million
and
then
that's
unfair
as
compared
to
another
business
of
getting
a
subsidy
of
$20
million.
that
this
is
something
that
operates
in
relation
to,
not
only
the
rudiments
of
existence
in
a
monetary
sense,
but
in
relation
to
such
things
as
keeping
families
together.but
the
answer
to,
when
they
dismiss,
was
the
only
thing
we
can
do
is
put
your
children
in
institutional
care.
in
relation
to
vera
barley,
the
discrimination
operated
literally
in
relation
to
human
liberty.
and
i
think
that
those
aspects
of
it
are
important.
then
the
other
thing
that
i
was
seeking
to
emphasize
along
the
way
is
that
these
people
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
need
and
all
other
things
that
are
relevant
from
the
standpoint
of
the
purposes
of
this
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
resident.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
resident,
we
so
contend.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
hew
definitions,
as
soon
as
he
arrives
and
begins
to
abide
there
with
no
intention
to
leave,
no
intention
immediately
to
leave.
i
would
say
that
the
distinction
is
an
invalid
one
subject
to
the
matter
of
a
--
of
a
period
of
time
to
determine
whether
he
is
a
resident
and
i
would
say
that
the
state
has
no
sufficient
justification
for
discriminating
against
new
comer.
i
will
also
argue,
but
i
would
like
to
postpone
this
till
tomorrow
and
i
get
a
little
farther
on
my
argument.
but
i
will
also
argue,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
even
if
we
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
i
am
wrong
in
saying
that
it
has
no
power
to
take
any
steps,
i
will
argue
that
this
statute
is
overly
broad
for
reasons
i
will
explain
later
in
my
argument
and
that
the
state
could
deal
with
any
problem
which
might,
contrary
to
my
argument,
be
supposed
to
exist
by
an
hour
over
a
piece
of
legislation.
i've
--
i've
just,
if
i
may
to
take
the
one
minute
left,
i
was
emphasizing
that
these
plaintiffs
are
identically
situated
with
respect
to
need
and
anything
that
might
be
thought
relevant
to
determining
need
or
deserts
or
the
suitability
of
a
particular
kind
of
remedy.
the
other
reason
i
stressed
that
is
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
might
be
legitimately
concerned
if
we
were
pressing
it
to
pass
upon
the
reasonability
of
categories
of
aid
as
between
the
deaf
and
the
dumb
and
the
blind
or
as
between
the
widows
of
veterans
and
the
widows
of
civil
service
employee.
but
this
distinction
clearly
has
nothing
to
do
with
deciding
how
to
solve
one
problem
or
how
to
solve
another
problem
or
with
determining
what
is
the
nature
of
the
problem.
but
the
nature
of
the
problem
is
identical
in
the
case
of
the
new
residents
and
the
older
residents.
and
then
i
do
go
on,
justice
fortas,
in
the
morning
from
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
thought
the
show
that
the
classification
made
by
the
one
year
prior
residence
requirement.
between
old
residence,
on
the
one
hand
and
new
residence
on
the
other,
not
only
operates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities,
rudiments
of
life.
but
also,
that
it
is
utterly
unrelated
to
any
of
the
avowed
purposes
of
the
public
assistance
laws,
because
the
favored
and
the
disfavored
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
the
kind
or
extended
their
need
or
the
suitability
of
the
adc
program
for
parallel
programs
as
a
remedy.
in
the
absence
of
relation
to
some
irrational
relation
to
some
other
state
policy
therefore,
that
is
enough
to
make
--
re-submit
an
equal
protection
case
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
distinction
between
a
redheaded
man
and
brown
headed
man
or
any
other
capricious
classification.
now,
i
go
on
first
this
morning
to
point
out
that
our
case
is
stronger
still
because
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
has
singled
out
for
the
purposes
of
this
favor
hospital
treatment.
those
who
exercise
the
fundamental
liberty
of
moving
to
a
new
residence
in
pursuit
of
better
opportunities,
better
life
or
what
else
they
considered
to
be
an
advantage.
that
discrimination
we
say,
is
not
merely
capricious
but
it
is
invidious
in
the
same
sense
that
discrimination
on
grounds
of
race
or
religion
is
invidious,
and
it
also
operates
to
deter
the
exercise
of
a
right
which
underlies
a
number
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
of
course,
those
provisions
in
turn,
help
to
show
that
this
is
an
invidious
distinction.
that
is
one
that
our
fundamental
constitutional
principles
condemned.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
this
line
of
thought
brings
me
while
it
relies
on
the
constitutional
provisions
dealing
with
freedom
of
migration.
it
brings
me
back
ultimately
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
to
the
equal
protection
clause
cases.
i
stressed
that
because
i
think
this
analysis
eases
the
court's
problem
of
decision
and
makes
it
unnecessary
to
break
new
constitutional
ground
in
these
cases.
for
example,
one
does
not
have
under
these
circumstances
to
face
up
to
the
question,
what
exact
clause
of
the
constitution
do
you
find
this
in?
equally,
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia's
statute
is
involved
is
not
relevant
when
one
is
talking
about
a
classification
as
invidious
as
this.
whereas,
technically,
it
might
be
of
significance,
if
one
will
rely
on
article
4
section
2
alone
or
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
and
again,
one
does
not
have
to
consider
precisely
how
far
congress
is
entitled
to
define
or
limit
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
united
states
citizens
because
certainly
again,
it
is
subject
in
its
legislation
to
the
due
process
clause.
now,
we
find
the
constitutional
recognition
or
reflection
of
this
basic
liberty.
the
constitutional
condemnation
--
underlying
condemnation
and
discrimination
between
old
--
discrimination
between
old
and
new
residents
in
three
or
four
familiar
clauses
of
the
constitution.
the
first
is
article
4,
section
2,
which
guarantees
the
citizens
of
any
state
should
be
entitled
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
citizens
of
the
several
states.
in
blake
and
mcclung
this
court
pointed
out,
that
the
underlying
phases
of
that
clause
was
that
a
citizen
of
one
state
should
not
be
in
a
condition
of
alienage
when
he
is
within
or
when
he
removed
to
another
state.
i
suggest
the
old
notion
of
the
elizabethan
settlement
laws
was
precisely
that
one
is
in
the
condition
of
alienage
when
it
comes
to
the
new
community.
the
commerce
clause
as
interpreted
in
crandall
and
nevada
and
the
edward's
case
incorporates
or
reflects
at
least
to
some
extent
this
fundamental
notion.
indeed,
it
is
interesting
to
recall
that
while
in
the
edward's
case,
the
court
--
the
majority
opinion,
did
not
consider
how
far
a
state
was
under
an
obligation
to
a
court
the
same
benefits
to
immigrants
that
it
accorded
to
all
their
residents
because
that
was
in
front
of
it.
it
did
point
out
that
the
philosophy
of
the
elizabethan
settlement
laws
is
the
majority
of
opinions
that
is
no
longer
in
accordance
with
the
facts.
third,
we
find
this
basic
notion
again,
reflected
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
was
considerable
discussion
when
the
14th
amendment
was
under
deliberation
by
the
congress
about
the
right
to
move
freely
from
place
to
place,
freedom
of
locomotion.
i
am
not
aware
justice
fortas
although
i
haven't
recently
made
a
detailed
search,
i
must
confess.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
explicit
mention
of
going
from
one
state
to
another
the
discussion
clearly
did
take
place
in
terms
of
movement
where
you
will
and
i
should
supposed
that
fairly
interpreted
that
incorporated
going
from
one
state
to
another.
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
explicit
mention
of
this
before
the
slaughter-house
case.
there,
in
the
majority
opinion,
it
is
stated,
it
was
referenced
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
one
of
the
rights
is
this,
it
“is
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
can,
of
his
own
volition,
become
a
citizen
of
any
state
of
the
union
by
a
bona
fide
residence
therein,
with
the
same
rights
as
other
citizens
of
that
state”
and
in
the
sense
of
course,
this
is
history
because
the
opinion
was
written
within
the
memory
event
who
had
been
alive
and
taking
part
in
affairs
at
the
time
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
under
consideration.
and
finally,
i
recall
that
the
court
--
that
the
guarantee
of
liberty
in
the
due
process
clause
has
been
cited
by
such
distinguished
scholars
as
zechariah
chafee
or
as
a
source
of
the
right
to
move
from
state
to
state
and
as
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
curtail
that
right.
now
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
discrimination,
not
only
is
capricious
in
the
sense
that
i
argued
yesterday,
but
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
those
who
are
exercising
a
constitutional
liberty,
i
suggest
that
a
decision
condemning
that
discrimination
would
be
in
accordance
with
settled
constitutional
principles.
unless
of
course,
and
i
now
come
to
the
last
point,
unless
it
can
be
shown
to
bear
a
rational
relationship
to
some
state
objective
other
than
that
set
forth
in
the
legislation,
because
its
perfectly
clear
that
this
discrimination
does
not
fulfill
any
of
the
objectives
set
forth
in
the
legislation.
in
considering
the
various
justifications
that
have
been
advanced,
i
would
like
to
start
by
clearing
the
under
branch,
there
are
numbers
that
seemed
to
me,
to
one
can
dispose
of
very
quickly,
while
there
are
others
that
perhaps
requires
somewhat
further
discussion.
first,
it
is
said
that
this
one
year
is
delay;
this
discrimination
is
an
aid
in
budgeting
for
a
subsequent
year.
no
one
has
suggested
how
this
aid's
budgeting.
and
i
must
confess
although,
i
maybe
wrong
because
i
have
never
made
up
a
welfare
budget,
i
can't
see
how
it
would
aid
budgeting.
no
one
has
a
census
of
the
people
who
come
in
during
a
year,
who
may
go
on
welfare
which
they
can
later
use
as
a
basis
for
knowing
who
will
be
added
to
the
roads
for
next
year.
indeed
it
is
my
impression
that
no
one
has
a
census
of
the
number
of
people
who
move
in
to
a
state
in
any
particular
year
even
in
(inaudible)
at
least
not
ordinarily.
but
so
that
the
figures
that
might
make
the
projection
somewhat
easier
simply
aren't
available.
second,
there
are
other
elements
that
enter
into
the
prediction
of
the
sides
of
the
welfare
roads
such
as
the
value
of
employment
and
other
things
of
that
kind.
it
would
overwhelm
the
significance
of
this
relatively
small
figure
of
the
number
of
people
who
have
become
bona
fide
residents
who
haven't
been
there
a
year
and
finally,
i
suggest
that
under
carrington
and
rash
and
similar
decisions
of
this
court,
the
slight
administrative
aid
in
convenience
in
budgeting
even
if
it
existed
would
not
be
adequate
to
justify
discrimination
as
severe
and
hostile
as
this.
second
that
is
said,
that
this
discrimination
is
justified
because
it
will
prevent
people
from
presenting
fraudulent
claims
to
two
or
more
states.
there's
absolutely
no
showing
of
any
likelihood
of
this
kind
of
fraud.
the
total
errors
checks
indicate
in
the
adc
payments
for
all
kinds
of
eligibility
run
around
3%
while
a
number
of
errors
in
fraud
by
making
paid
claims
onto
a
state
would
be
fantastically
small
and
i
may
add
that
there
other
--
other
checks
and
sources
of
money
of
course
are
made
and
this
could
be
checked
along
with
that.
a
weight
of
deal,
i
think,
to
illustrate
how
farfetched
this
argument
is,
is
to
suppose
that
a
state
where
to
make
it
crime,
i
guess
it
is
to
seek
welfare
in
two
jurisdictions.
and
in
order
to
enact
the
subsection
saying,
whoever
applies
for
aid
within
one
year
of
moving
into
the
state
shall
be
presumed
to
be
committing
fraud
by
seeking
payments
from
two
states.
even
a
prima
facie
rebuttable
presumption
of
that
kind
without
unquestionably
be
struck
down
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
same
way
as
in
thought
against
the
united
states
and
other
cases
of
that
kind.
and
finally
on
this
point,
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
in
principle
squarely
the
kind
of
thing
that
oyama
forbids,
that
there
that
was
created
in
arbitrary
presumption
that
one
was
circumventing
the
california
laws
but
with
respect
to
who
may
hold
agriculture
premises
and
the
court
said
that
california
could
not
create
an
invidious
discrimination
against
the
american
citizens
of
japanese
decent.
in
order
to
deal
with
the
few
cases
of
fraud,
that
might
otherwise
be
involved.
third,
it
is
suggesting
that
this
rule
provides
an
objective
test
of
residence
over
this
in
the
district
of
columbia
brief
and
it
was
suggested
by
judge
holtzoff.
i
think
at
this
point
one
has
to
be
very
careful
about
what
he
means
when
he
says
that
the
requirement
of
one
year
residence
provides
an
objective
test
of
residency.
residence
under
the
social
security
laws
means
residence
means
presence
in
the
state,
living
there,
not
for
a
temporary
purpose.
in
other
words,
without
the
intention
of
going
somewhere
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
would
then
be
a
resident
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it
would
then
be
a
--
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
think
of
someone
doing
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
still
qualified
--
no,
oh
no,
and
--
and
still
qualify
for
aid
to
dependent
children,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
very
money
spent
going
back
and
forth.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i
suggest
it
is
in
the
common
thing
in
relation
to
the
types
of
people
we
are
talking
about
here
or
but
in
that
event,
i
would
say
that
if
the
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
its
--
perhaps
i
am
wrong
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i'm
--
i'm
prepared
to
answer
your
question
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
such
--
such
a
person
under
our
position,
i'm
going
to
answer
you
squarely.
such
a
person
under
our
position
would
be
entitled
to
aid
six
months
in
massachusetts
and
six
months
in
florida.
and
that
is
squarely
the
argument
that
we
made,
and
it
seems
to
be
me
that
that's
entirely
appropriate
effectively
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
quite.
and
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
case
that
falls
suitable
to
the
kind
of
aid
that
is
being
talked
about.
but
once
those
facts
appeared
as
justice
black's
states
them,
although,
i
think
that
will
be
the
most
extraordinary.
i
don't
mean
to
shriek
from
answering
you
but
they
would
be
entitled
to
aid
in
both
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
hope
not
mr.
justice.
the
part
that
i
want
to
emphasize
with
respect
to
this
test
of
residence
is
that
one
must
ask
what
is
it
that
you
are
trying
to
test.
i
think
that
it
lurks
behind
that
expression
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
came
out
in
mr.
barton's
argument
yesterday.
the
notion
that
we
are
really
asking
more
permanency
than
being
in
the
state
voluntarily
with
no
intention
of
living
and
if
to
the
extent
that
something
more
lurks
there
but
then
our
answer
is
simply
that
requiring
to
something
more
is
itself
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
classification.
to
the
extent
that
this
is
meant,
the
justification
is
alleged
as
being
and
just
providing
a
test
of
who
is
a
resident
in
the
sense
of
which
the
hew
uses
the
term
and
the
welfare
laws
use
the
term,
that
is
voluntary
presence
with
no
intention
to
go.
then
we
say,
again
this
is
--
it
isn't
a
good
test.
it's
utterly
--
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
say
that
whoever
has
lived
in
the
state
must
be
presumed
to
have
an
intention
of
presently
living
in
the
state.
we
just
know
that
isn't
so
and
of
course,
there
is
no
better
proof
that
isn't
so
in
many,
many
instances
than
these
records.
certainly
little
shawn
brown,
the
baby,
who
haven't
been
born
for
more
than
a
year
ago
had
no
greater
intention
to
live
the
district
of
columbia
than
his
mother
and
the
oldest
member
of
the
family,
who
qualified
for
the
aid.
certainly,
juanita
smith,
the
young
woman
who
had
--
who's
family
for
generations
had
lived
in
pennsylvania
got
away
for
a
few
years
and
then
came
back
to
rejoin
her
own
family,
which
she'd
promise
to
look
out
for
can't,
be
said
to
have
been
likely
to
be
planning
to
leave
pennsylvania
just
because
she'd
been
away
for
a
short
time.
i
mentioned
in
one
other
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
bear
out
this
point
but
illustrate
some
others.
the
other
plaintiff
from
the
pennsylvania
case
was
jose
foster.
she
had
four
children,
had
been
on
aid
in
pennsylvania.
the
reason
she
left
to
go
to
south
carolina
was
to
take
care
of
some
old
aged
and
sick
parents,
and
as
long
as
she,
which
incidentally
involved
to
cut
in
any
welfare
benefits.
after
they
reached
the
point
where
she
could
no
longer
help
them,
she
went
back
to
pennsylvania,
were
now
to
presume
because
she
hadn't
been
back
a
year
that
she
intended
to
live
again
is
i
submit
to
you,
utterly
absurd.
again,
i
think
if
this
was
stated
in
the
form
of
a
presumption,
it
should
be
presumed
that
any
person
who
hasn't
been
a
resident
for
a
year
intends
to
live
or
is
a
drifter.
that
one
would
say,
of
course,
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
it's
equally
arbitrary
and
capricious
when
it's
advanced
as
a
test.
i
would
add
two
more
points
although,
i
think
they're
unnecessary.
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
where
there
is
an
elaborate
process
of
verification
with
respect
to
other
conditions
of
eligibility
involving
not
only
elaborate
questionnaires
or
visits
to
the
home,
surveillance
in
many
jurisdictions,
checking
on
references.
if
that
can
be
done
with
the
respect
to
other
conditions
of
eligibility
but
it
certainly
can
be
done
with
equal
ease
with
respect
to
this
better,
of
whether
the
signs
of
the
person
intends
to
live,
and
so
again
i
suggest
that
the
cases
like
carrington
and
yet
rash
and
oyama
and
california,
harman
and
forssenius,
all
sustain
our
position
that
this
won't
do
as
a
justification.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
point
i
confess
your
honor,
i
hadn't
thought
of,
but
it
seems
to
me
and
to
be
entirely
valid,
it
also
does
recall
to
my
mind
another
point
and
that
is
of
course
the
person
who
does
the
leave
the
former
state.
if
this
rule
can
stand,
it's
likely
to
fall
into
a
gap,
and
not
get
welfare
anyway.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
retaining
your
rights
in
the
place
that
you
have
left.
the
last
of
the
arguments
that
i
regard
is
very
easily
brushed
aside
is
the
suggestion
that
the
purpose
is
to
limit
assistance
to
those
who
have
made
a
contribution
to
the
community
or
who
have
some
investment
in
the
community.
well
i
don't
how
we
measure
the
matter
of
contribution
or
investment
in
the
community.
i
suggest
that
this
is
really
a
euphemistic
way
of
expressing
the
same
discrimination
against
strangers
or
outsiders.
i
don't
see
how
in
the
brown
family,
anybody
can
say
that
one
of
the
children
and
the
mother
had
an
investment
in
washington
or
had
made
a
contribution
to
the
washington
and
the
others
haven't.
but
remember,
we're
talking
basically
here
about
the
aid
to
dependent
children
and
the
whole
notion
of
investment
in
the
community.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
said
before
to
be
simply
euphemism.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
voting?
eligibility
for
professions.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
presents
a
different
problem,
i
don't
mean
by
my
tone
of
voice
to
imply
that
they
are
all
constitutional
then
they've
been
held
unconstitutional.
i
haven't
thought
of
a
case
in
that
category
justice
stewart
where
this
would
be
a
permissible
consideration
but
maybe
that
there
is
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
a
knowledge
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we're
using
--
i
was
using
investment
in
more
in
the
sense
of
what
one
had
contributed
to
the
community
and
was
not
focusing
as
you
suggest
on
concern
for
the
community,
interest
in
the
character
of
the
community.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
in
the
latter
case
this
might
well
be
justifying
consideration.
but
i
suggest
it
is
not
relevant
here,
because
there
is
no
--
i
don't
think
one
can
use
this
kind
of
benefit
any
more
than
one
may
use
schools
or
fire
or
police
protection,
as
a
reward
for
what
people
have
been
supposed
to
contribute.
i
would
say
that
the
emphasis
was
on
the
knowledge
and
familiarity
with
the
problems
in
--
that
you
do
express
opinion
on
and
choose
candidates
to
deal
with
that
was
relevant
if
voting
the
residence
requirement
is
to
be
justified.
mr.
archibald
cox
precisely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
indeed,
we
would
stress
that
point
in
addition
to
the
one
that
has
already
been
mentioned.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
think
i
have
thought
to
stress
as
the
basic
right,
the
right
to
live
where
you
please.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
journey
or
to
make
a
pleasure,
to
swing
around
the
country
or
to
go
europe
is
a
--
raises
different
problems
and
is
a
lesser
right
i
would
think.
and
my
case,
your
honor,
emphasize
of
why
i
should
have
made
more
sharply
perhaps.
our
case
deals
with
the
right
to
live
where
you
please,
to
seek
better
opportunities.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
agree
indeed.
i
--
i
would
urge
that
that
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
our
submission.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
except
that
the
constitution
itself
introduces
that
distinction
that
it
occurred
to
and
perhaps
will
occur
to
your
honor
that
this
rather
like
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
connection
with
the
apportionment
cases
about
the
senate
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
is,
that
the
constitution
itself
says
that
qualification
to
vote
for
local
people
shall
be
the
standard
of
qualification
to
vote
for
the
president.
now
whether
the
congress
could
change
that
or
not,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
the
constitution
--
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
i
don't
that
i
can
argue
that
the
equal
protection
clause
repeals
the
provision
of
the
constitution,
dealing
with
the
qualifications
of
electives
for
the
presidency
and
the
constitution
itself
says,
that
those
who
should
be
qualified
to
vote
for
president,
shall
be
those
qualified
to
vote
for
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature.
and
in
terms
of
that
consideration,
as
suggested
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
stewart,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
an
argument,
i
don't
have
to
either
espouse
or
reject
it,
but
there
is
an
argument
not
present
here
that
goes
to
justify
the
rationality
of
the
classification
for
that
purpose
and
then
the
other
clause
about
qualifications
for
president
operates
on
it
automatically.
so
that
--
i
think
your
honor's
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
a
very
analogous
one
if
it
weren't
for
perhaps,
what
today
seems
like
an
odd
constitutional
query
and
my
answer,
were
it
not
for
that
quirk,
i
suspect
would
have
to
be
very
different
although,
i
don't
want
to
pin
myself
to
it.
now
there's
a
group
of
(inaudible)
that
i
want
to
lump
together
because
once
again,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
be
exact
about
in
our
terminology.
it
is
said
in
this
group
of
(inaudible)
that
the
state
might
protect
its
financial
possession
that
it
may
deter
the
poor
from
entering
the
state
and
that
it
may
prevent
the
movement
of
indigents
into
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
securing
welfare
payments.
again,
i
think
one
has
to
be
exact
about
what
it
means
to
the
extent
that
this
is
simply
an
argument
that
it
would
cost
us
traditional
money
to
give
welfare
to
residents
for
less
than
a
year.
but
the
answer
is
that
the
cause
won't
excuse
a
classification
which
otherwise
violates
the
constitution.
a
state
could
say
that
discrimination
against
black
mothers
and
children
would
save
us
money,
but
nobody
would
think
of
advancing
that
as
a
justification
for
the
invidious
and
hostile
classification
or
discrimination
on
grounds
of
religion
that
might
save
money,
probably
save
south
carolina
a
little
bit
of
money
in
sherbert
and
verner.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
except
again,
i
point
out
that
ours
isn't
barely
capricious,
it's
invidious
or
hostile.
but
the
point
your
honor
(inaudible),
of
course
true.
i
do
think
in
view
of
the
figures
that
have
been
cited
to
the
court
however,
it
might
be
pertinent
for
me
to
take
just
a
minute
to
say
something
about
the
matter
of
cost
here.
although,
i
don't
want
to
retreat
from
my
position,
that
it's
constitutionally
irrelevant.
i
think
in
view
of
the
arguments,
the
court
might
be
concerned.
the
effect
of
the
deletion
of
the
residence
requirements
obviously
will
differ
very
greatly
from
state
to
state
because
of
the
current
trends
of
migration.
and
i
must
also
make
it
very
clear
that
in
my
judgment
of
figures
on
this
are
hard
to
come
by
and
are
not
all
together
reliable.
i
don't
want
to
seem
to
be
saying
to
the
court
anything
more
than
here's
the
best
indication
we
have.
in
pennsylvania,
the
welfare
authorities
estimated
that
the
elimination
of
the
requirement
would
add
one
half
of
one
percent
in
public
assistance,
chiefly
adc.
a
point
of
fact
during
the
period
in
which
the
injunction
was
operating
and
therefore
the
requirement
couldn't
be
applied.
the
increase
i
am
told
will
grant
only
half
of
that,
one
quarter
or
one
percent.
in
connecticut,
the
figures
is
somewhat
more,
that's
a
state
where
--
what
they
and
other
concerns
advertise
very
widely
all
over
new
england
that
looking
for
people
to
work
there,
and
people
who
are
coming
into
connecticut
to
getting
jobs
and
then
encountering
misfortune.
there,
the
figures
seemed
to
be
slightly
less
than
two
percent,
1.7
on
one
period
of
time
when
connecticut
had
no
residence
requirement
and
1.9
on
another
set
of
figures.
illinois,
our
information
is
that
during
two
months
in
which
the
operation
of
the
residence
requirement
of
the
state
that
it
was
something
less
than
3%
of
the
applications,
not
the
people
on
the
roles
of
the
applications
which
would
be
a
much
lesser
figure
that
came
from
people
who
haven't
been
resident
for
a
year.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
applications
of
people
who
haven't
been
in
the
district
a
year
during
the
past
nine
months
have
run
in
the
neighborhood
of
8%,
a
little
over
8%.
so
that's
one
way
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
percentage
of
new
applicants
has
run
to
a
little
more
than
8%.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
have
the
exact
figures.
it
runs
to
--
it
would
take
me
a
minute
to
dig
it
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
--
it's
800
--
it's
running
about
a
thousand
a
year
but
this
is
out
of
the
total
new
applications
during
the
year,
is
8
and
a
fraction
percent.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they
were
put
together
very
recently.
i'd
be
glad
to
supply
them
or
you
can
find
them
in
the
morning
paper
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
we're
not
too
exact
with
the
general
figures.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
i
said
there
that
--
no
--
oh
no,
many
more
than
a
thousand
--
mr.
archibald
cox
many
more.
well
i
must
have
misspoke
myself.
i
meant
to
say
that
there
have
been
745
applications
from
those
who
have
not
been
resident
a
year
in
the
first
eight
months
of
1968.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
about
8%
of
all
new
applications
during
that
period
and
out
of
those
745,
about
half
were
approved.
now,
if
you
move
to
another
state,
maryland,
with
the
reported
figures
there
are
way
down
and
the
order
is
something
around
2%.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
any
for
those
states.
i
doubt
very
much
that
throughout
--
because
i
remember
these
figures
that
have
been
hastily
put
together
in
an
effort
to
make
a
guess
to
what
the
impact
of
this
would
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
my
--
we're
talking
i
think
about
two
different
sets
of
figures
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
your
honor
would
find
that
in
terms
of
people
who
end
up
with
adc
care,
that
it's
the
district
of
columbia
and
new
york
city
that
would
be
the
highest
states
or
because
there
the
flow
of
migration
of
the
people
who
end
up
with
adc
care
is
for
the
most
part
from
the
rural
areas
and
very
largely
from
the
south
into
those
areas.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
this
shows
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suggest
to
you
the
explanation
is
that
the
general
movement
of
population
is
not
the
same
as
the
movement
of
the
population
that
ends
up
or
as
i
put
it,
on
the
adc
role
that
these
had
indeed
--
i
can't
help
suggesting
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
character
of
this
discrimination
against
new
residents.
the
story
from
the
new
york
times,
it
was
distributed
by
counsel
for
the
appellees
yesterday,
has
as
its
headline,
south
fostering
relief
rise
here
and
i
think
the
implication,
the
effect
of
south
fostering
relief
rise
here
and
in
fact
the
connection
between
this
and
the
residence
requirement
in
many
jurisdictions
is
quite
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
there
was
a
different
case
but
my
answer
would
be
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
other
words,
i
do
recognize
the
difference
between
a
resource
that
is
fixed
and
there
can
be
only
so
many
that
i
can
imagine
cases
where
that
might
be
impermissible
consideration.
but
my
answer
has
replied
to
your
honor's
case
would
be
just
the
same
as
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
now
we're
getting
very
close
to
toomer
and
witsell
and
when
you
say
for
the
people
of
the
state,
your
honor
is
suggesting
the
distinction
that
we
are
concerned
with.
you're
suggesting
a
distinction
between
the
residents
and
non-residents,
we're
drawing
at
this
--
we're
saying
you
may
not
draw
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
residents.
but
the
state's
resources
and
keeping
the
state's
natural
resources
within
the
state
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
somewhat
different
problem.
i
think
our
case
is
more
like
the
case
put
by
justice
douglas
yesterday
of
saying,
“we're
going
to
exclude
the
children
of
new
comers
from
the
schools.”
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
the
out-of-state
tuition
differs
in
a
number
of
respects.
in
the
first
place,
you
are
dealing
not
with
one
of
the
basic
necessities
in
life,
college
education,
important
as
it
is,
isn't
quite
in
that
classification
yet.
but
second,
you're
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
just
think
that
whether
you
preserve
the
family
or
whether
people
have
food
or
shelter
over
their
heads
or
whether
they
go
free,
like
(inaudible)
is
more
fundamental,
more
important
to
human
existence
than
one
that
had
--
whether
one
has
the
benefit
of
a
college
education
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
suggest
that
it
may
be
although
i
don't
have
to
decide
the
college
education
case.
then
i
think
there
are
two
other
factors
in
the
college
education
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
generally.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
well
i
suggest
that
that
is
one
possible
distinction
and
it
entirely
tenable,
i
think
as
tenable
one,
i
think
the
constitution
is
concerned
with
differences
of
degree.
i
think
a
second
possible
distinction
is
that
when
you're
talking
of
college
students,
you're
talking
of
people
who
go
into
the
state.
it's
rather
likely
non-resident
hunter
that
justice
white
and
i
would
describe.
the
student
goes
in
simply
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
this
education.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
he
has
such
a
case,
and
there
are
students
who
have
such
case,
then
i
think,
he
may
well
be
able
to
attack
successfully
the
discrimination
against
him
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief
including
a
case
in
iowa
which
hold
that
that
kind
of
discrimination
is
unconstitutional.
but
that
is
different
from
the
man
who
goes
to
berkeley
or
ucla
or
harvard
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
education
(voice
overlap)
--
then
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
will
if
ever
we
have
them.
they're
--
they're
hard
to
come
by
and
i
know
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
right,
we
will
certainly
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
these
depends
the
availability
of
the
figures
we're
speaking
about
mr.
chief
justice.
we'll
try
to
get
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
depend
on
their
having
been
any
injunction,
staying
the
application
of
the
residence
requirement
and
then
on
the
people
having
kept
the
figures
in
the
welfare
agency.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
the
genuine
migrant
presented
a
different
problem.
but
here,
are
talking
about
someone
who
is
not
moving
from
place
to
place.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
your
honor
that
there
isn't
ground
for
a
constitutional
attack
in
those
cases,
but
i
do
suggest
that
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
what
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
if
we
were
to
lose
these
cases?
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
would
think
clearly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
think
clearly,
it
would
even
enable
connecticut
to
say
that
it
would
not
admit
to
the
schools
in
greenwich
and
other
places
near
new
york.
the
children
or
people
who
move
out
from
new
york
to
greenwich
because
there
are
better
schools
there.
now
i
do
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
related
to
the
school
system
which
i
am
familiar
with
where
perhaps
in
my
town,
i
don't
think
well
of
the
public
school
and
i
want
to
send
my
child
to
the
public
school
in
the
next
town
of
(inaudible)
but
there,
i
think
another
factor
comes
into
play
and
that
is,
that
the
--
in
that
case,
where
the
payment
may
be
regarded
--
or
as
and
this
is
another
application
of
the
college
case,
may
be
regarded
as
roughly
related
to
the
amount
of
contribution
that
i
and
my
family
would
make
directly
or
indirectly
in
texas
to
the
schools
in
wayland
and
i
ought
to
do
something
roughly
equal
if
i'm
going
to
send
my
child
to
(inaudible)
and
again
of
course,
it's
a
distinction
between
residents
and
non-residents
and
not
what
we
have
a
discrimination
between
residents.
but
i'll
make
since
my
time
has
jumped
ahead,
we
spent
so
much
time
on
the
figures.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
perhaps.
there
is
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
jumping
ahead.
we
argue
two
more
things
with
respect
to
this
poor
people
moving
into
the
state.
first,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
move
in
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
welfare
requirements.
and
if,
your
honors
as
we
look
at
this
newspaper
story
that
was
given
to
you
by
our
counsel
through
appellees.
you'll
see
that
the
main
points
it
stresses
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
do
not
move
for
that
purpose
mr.
archibald
cox
we
had
--
i
had
hoped
to
have
time
to
develop
the
figures.
all
the
evidence
we
have
tends
to
show
that
there
has
been
very
little
movement
for
this
purpose,
but
the
point
i
think,
the
important
point
to
emphasize
is
that
the
appellees
who
invoke
this
justification
have
nothing
to
support
and
i
suggest
that
in
dealing
with
a
discrimination
or
with
respect
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
and
it
runs
against
the
stranger
who
is
likely
to
be
the
victim
of
invidious
treatment
and
in
dealing
with
a
discrimination
against
those
who
are
outside
the
state
and
who
are
because
of
their
poverty
are
not
fully
represented
in
the
political
process.
it's
something
more
than
common
assertion
is
necessary
to
show
that
people
go
into
the
state
for
this
purpose.
i
would
like
for
--
i
may
to
say
just
two
more
sentences.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
additional
point
that
i
would
make
that
while
i
think
no
discrimination
can
be
justified
on
the
assumption
that
the
higher
relief
payment
operates
has
a
magnet
and
i
would
stick
on
that
ground.
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
if
it'd
be
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
a
state
might
deal
with
this
problem
in
an
appropriate
way,
that
this
way
of
dealing
with
it
is
unconstitutional
or
because
it
is
excessively
broad
and
not
to
measure,
at
least,
restrictive
of
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
liberty.
i
point
out
that
it's
excessively
broad
in
a
number
of
respects.
first,
it
applies
the
one
year
residence
requirement
even
to
people
who
have
come
from
states
with
lower
or
equal
benefit
levels.
even
to
people
who
have
come
from
states
with
higher
or
equal
benefit
levels
and
indeed
that
what
finds
the
residence
requirement
more
uniformly
in
the
states
that
have
the
lowest
benefit
levels.
second,
it
applies
to
people
who
come
for
reasons
that
demonstrably
are
unrelated
to
the
benefit
level
and
the
facts
to
these
cases
are
the
best
illustration
of
that.
well,
five
out
of
seven
were
coming
back
where
they've
lived
before,
another
five
out
of
seven
were
coming
to
join
families
and
of
course,
most
people
moved
for
hope
for
jobs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
with
this,
i
think
that's
true.
there's
no
--
no
doubt
that
is
a
political
matter
or
as
a
policy
matter
of
a
uniform
payment
would
be
highly
deserved.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
of
course
that
itself,
in
itself,
would
eliminate
any
problem
with
this
kind.
the
third
respect
in
which
i
suggest
that
this
particular
requirement
is
to
demonstratively
too
broad
is
that,
in
addition
to
the
other
two,
is
it
if
when
really
we're
concerned
with
this,
it
could
be
cured
by
saying
that
the
new
comer
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
only
the
benefits
of
the
state
from
which
he
came.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
fairly
undesirable.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
and
i
think,
if
the
problem
of
dealing
with
people
who
come
from
another
state
is
a
justification
for
classifications
which
would
otherwise
be
impermissible,
then
i
suggest,
that
it
will
justify
the
other
kind
of
classification
that
you
call
attention
to
and
is
not
as
severe
as
the
one
that
is
being
imposed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
comes
to,
but
if
i
assume
the
reverse
of
my
basic
contention,
i
do
suggest
seriously
that
this
is
a
(inaudible)
or
less
restrictive
measures
that
raises
no
other
constitutional
problem.
i'll
take
advantage
of
the
five
minutes
just
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
other
fact
but
also,
i
have
really
completed
my
argument.
there
was
a
talk
yesterday
about
the
welfare
freeze
that
takes
effect
with
respect
to
adc
aid
of
july
1,
1969
unless
it's
put
off
again
as
it
has
been
before.
without
going
into
all
the
complexities,
the
congress
made
two
exceptions
to
that.
one
was
to
cover
--
people
added
to
the
roles
because
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith
and
king,
king
against
smith.
and
second,
it
provided
an
exception
to
take
care
of
the
resident's
cases
in
the
event
that
the
judgments
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed,
but
so
that
there
is
no
problem
of
the
operation
of
the
freeze
and
the
decision
in
these
cases
of
creating
a
need
for
new
legislation.
also,
i
don't
think
really
that
would
justify
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
there
are
other
arguments
presented
in
our
briefs,
i
suggest
that
in
the
final
analysis,
the
decisions
below
can
most
simply
and
should
be
affirmed
upon
the
very
familiar
principle
that
a
legislative
classification
which
discriminates
without
justification
against
those
who
exercise
a
fundamental
constitutional
liberty
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
certainly
applies
to
the
granted
benefits
and
privileges
as
well
as
to
regulation
or
taxation.
the
one-year
residence
requirement
here
and
connecticut's
requirement
also
divides
mothers
and
children
who
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
their
need,
their
desires,
and
in
every
other
conceivably
relevant
way
into
two
classes,
all
residents
who
are
granted
the
benefit
and
newer
residents
who
are
denied.
and
the
discrimination
operates
in
relation
to
the
most
fundamental
necessities,
the
very
rudiments
of
life.
the
classification
rest
not
only
on
an
invidious
distinction
against
newcomers
or
strangers
but
it
singles
out
as
the
sole
ground
for
that
hospital
treatment
the
exercise
of
a
long-recognized
constitutional
liberty
to
leave
one
residence
and
to
move
to
another
in
the
search
of
better
opportunities,
better
associations,
and
better
environment,
a
privilege
which
has
been
fundamental
relics
of
this
country's
whole
existence.
finally,
i
shall
show
that
if
one
examines
the
alleged
justifications
for
this
discrimination
which
is
prima
facie
invidious
for
the
reason
that
i
have
stated.
he
finds
that
none
of
them
will
stand
careful
examination
because
none
of
them
are
reasonably
related
to
any
of
the
permissible
or
legitimate
object
of
state
policy.
before
elaborating
those
propositions
which
are
the
heart
of
the
cases
i
proposed
to
argue
with,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
go
back
and
put
the
issue
in
its
proper
statutory
and
factual
background.
historically,
as
the
brief
for
the
center
of
study
of
welfare
policy
and
law
finds
out.
historically,
public
assistance
laws
go
back
to
the
elizabethan
poor
laws
if
not
earlier.
and
as
the
amicus
brief
traces
it
down
in
this
deed
as
this
court
did
in
edwards
and
california
and
then
the
chief
justices
raised
an
opinion
in
king
and
smith.
there
was,
at
that
time
in
an
age
when
many
of
the
idea
still
derived
from
feudalism
and
then
in
an
age
when
most
people
certainly
ordinary
poor
people
were
not
very
mobile,
a
notion
that
each
vicinage
should
take
care
of
what
mrs.
williams
calls
“our
people”
of
those
who
are
settled
in,
and
that
it
had
no
obligation
to
those
strangers,
those
outsiders
who
come
from
someone
else,
somewhere
else,
and
whom
we
don't
quite
know,
and
we
don't
quite
trust,
and
we
don't
quite
like,
and
we
don't
have
any
obligation
to.
now,
in
the
present
century
when
matters
as
pension
laws
and
other
forms
and
social
assistance
began
to
be
adapted
in
this
country,
the
combination
of
this
anachronistic
idea
plus
a
continuing
hostility
to
distrust
for
poor
strangers.plus,
i
suspect
an
opposition
to
making
any
larger
expenditure
as
then
you
could
possibly
withheld,
combined
to
produce
in
the
early
statutes
extraordinarily
strict
length
of
residence
or
prior
residence
requirements.
for
mothers
aid
many
states
had
laws
requiring
four
or
five-year
residence.
for
old
age,
the
requirements
in
various
states
run
up
to
15,
20,
in
the
one
state
even
35
years
prior
residence.
and
that
was
the
situation
when
congress
considered
the
social
security
act
in
1935.
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
statute
provided
for
federal
contributions
to
approve
state
plans
in
a
number
of
categories
of
assistance
the
most
important
being
aid
to
dependent
children
and
that's
clearly
the
most
important
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged
and
later
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
congress
was
faced
by
this
duration
of
residence
requirements
and
concluded
that
they
were
objectionably
long.
and
with
respect
to
each
category
of
assistance,
it
imposed
a
limit
and
the
duration
of
residence
that
the
state
might
impose
or
might
require.
taking
as
an
example,
the
adc
program,
we
quote
in
page
39
of
our
brief
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act.
and
when
i
say
“our
brief”
i
mean
our
supplemental
brief.
the
administrator
shall
approve
any
plan
which
fulfills
the
conditions
specified
in
subsection
a,
accept
that
he
shall
not
approve
any
plan
which
imposes
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
aid
to
dependent
children.
a
residence
requirement
which
denies
aid
with
respect
to
any
child
residing
in
the
state,
who
has
resided
there
for
one
year
who
are
--
who
was
born
within
the
preceding
year
if
the
parent
had
resided
there
for
one
year.
now,
our
view
is
that
the
role
of
section
402
(b)
was
to
outlaw
residence
requirements
of
more
than
one
year
leaving
the
situation
with
respect
to
residence
requirement
of
a
year
or
less
exactly
where
congress
found
it.
it
said
that
more
than
a
year
is
bad
and
it
said
nothing
about
the
rest,
one
way
or
other.
this,
i
submit,
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
form
of
the
statute
and
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
that
was
to
set
minimum
requirements
and
then
leave
the
rest
to
the
states.
now,
i
stress
the
point
because
it
means,
of
course,
that
the
courts
below
were
right
in
very
largely
ignoring
section
402(b).
it
drops
out
of
the
case
for
two
reasons,
first,
if
congress
didn't
express
any
judgment
on
residence
requirements
for
less
than
a
year,
then
certainly
there
is
no
question
of
the
judiciary
differing
to
the
legislative
judgment
the
congressional
judgment
that
a
residence
requirement
of
one
year
is
a
good
thing.
congress
didn't
have
to
address
itself
to
them
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
have
expressed
any
such
judgment.
second,
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
worry
about
invalidating
any
provision
of
the
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
that
directs
the
secretary
of
hew
to
approve
a
plan
which
includes
a
discrimination
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
no
i
think
--
i
think
not
because
i
think
congress
wasn't
really
addressing
it
to
the
south,
to
the
question
whether
it
is
our
judgment
that
these
are
not
inconsistent.
but
when
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
the
commerce
clause,
it
was
simply
saying
we
don't
say
anything
about
it.
but
of
course
on
the
approach
that
i
stated
at
the
outset,
and
i
think
each
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
approach
that
i
have
stated
at
the
outset,
one
doesn't
have
to
concern
himself
with
that
question
because
one
comes
back
and
pitches
this
case
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
--
i
don't
like
to
call
it
the
right
to
travel
because
it's
the
right
to
migrate
and
settle
in
a
new
place
and
to
seek
new
advantages
not
just
to
move
around
are
important
because
they
show
that
this
is
an
affirmative
constitutional
value.
but
we
are
not
concern.
was
there
more
technical
scope
or
with
that
--
just
what
body
they
apply
to
or
just
what
technically
is
the
source
the
right.
i
should
remind
the
court
as
we
might
have
in
our
brief
that
the
administrator
of
social
security
and
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health
education
welfare
has
often
refused
to
approve
state
plans
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
substantive
sense
not
because
he
concluded
they
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
necessarily
or
establishing
other
inequitable
classifications.
but
two
examples
have
come
quickly
to
mind
are
his
disapproval
of
a
plan,
which
would
have
excluded
indians
and
children
of
indians,
and
his
disapproval
of
a
plan
that
would
have
excluded
illegitimate
children.
both
of
those
under
the
equitable
classification
law
were
disapproved
by
the
secretary
even
though
they're
not
expressly
mentioned
in
section
402.
and
surely,
that
same
power
applies
to
giving
effect
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
eligibility.
i
add,
although
i
hope
it's
not
necessary,
that
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
reading
of
section
402(b),
then
of
course
we
say
that
section
402(b)
is
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason
that
we
say
that
the
state
laws
and
the
special
statute
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
thought
it
brought
up
to
bare,
justice
harlan,
only
to
the
point
of
saying
it's
not
so
bad
that
we
are
going
to
strike
it
down.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
quite
different
from
what
a
legislative
body
does
when
it
brings
its
judgment
to
bare
on
the
question
and
say,
“we
are
going
to
impose
this.”
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
excuse
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
you
were
saying
something
different
then
you
were
--
of
course
congress
brought
it's
quite
--
i
wouldn't
deny
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course
it
is.
i'm
very
sorry.
under
section
402(b)
which
i
certainly
can't
argue
outlaws
the
one-year
residence
requirement.
about
40
states
have
enacted
one-year
residence
requirements.
other
states
including
new
york,
rhode
island,
and
today
massachusetts,
maine,
hawaii,
and
a
few
others,
do
not
have
a
residence
requirement.
a
typical
residence
requirement
is
found
in
the
--
is
the
one
in
the
pennsylvania
case
which
you
will
find
on
page
1a
of
the
pennsylvania
brief.
it
provides
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“assistance
may
be
granted
only
to
or
on
behalf
of
a
person
residing
in
pennsylvania
which
resided
therein
for
at
least
one
year
preceding
the
date
of
application
or
who
has
resided
in
a
state
with
which
pennsylvania
has
a
reciprocal
agreement
making
residence
unnecessary.
i
mentioned
they
are
because
i
come
back
to
the
significance
of
that
alternative
later.
i
think
it
has
a
good
deal
of
bearing
on
what
are
the
purposes
of
this
legislature.
the
operation
of
the
statute
in
pennsylvania,
but
also
it
will
serve
for
other
cases,
is
illustrated
by
its
application
to
the
plaintiff
juanita
smith.
juanita
smith
lived
in
pennsylvania
with
a
family,
with
a
mother
and
father
who
had
lived
there
all
their
lives
forbearance
who
had
lived
there
earlier.
from
the
time
she
was
one
month
old
until
she
must
been
around
16
or
17,
until
she
was
old
enough
to
bare
children,
she
then
went
to
delaware
with
a
man
named
peter
where
they
lived
for
a
few
years.
she
came
back
with
five
children.
at
the
invitation
of
her
father
who
had
promised
to
help
--
help
peter
to
get
a
job
and
to
help
the
family
out
until
peter
did
get
a
job.
so
this
was
a
very,
in
a
real
sense,
a
matter
of
going
back
home
if
i
may
use
home
colloquially
in
the
family
sense
or
rather
than
in
any
technical
sense
of
domicile.
it
was
rejoining
the
family
and
going
to
the
family
to
get
help.
unfortunately,
peter
didn't
get
a
job
and
went
back
to
delaware
then
when
juanita
smith's
father
lost
his
job,
he
couldn't
take
care
of
her
and
the
five
children
anymore.
she
was
pregnant,
sick
with
a
very
bad
varicose
problem,
and
she
went
to
the
welfare
people.
the
welfare
people,
because
of
the
residence
requirement
had
no
solution.
the
only
thing
they
could
say
was,
“we'll
either
go
back
to
delaware,”
because
she
didn't
want
to
leave
her
family.
she
didn't
want
to
go
back
to
delaware
for
other
reasons.
or,
we'll
take
your
children
away
from
you
and
provide
institutional
care
which
might
run
anywhere
from
six
months
to
two
years.
and
this
at
least
will
provide
them
with
shelter.
but
there's
nothing
else
under
the
residence
requirement
we
--
they
could
do.
ms.
smith
was
taken
care
of
by
the
travelers
aid
society
which
agreed
to
provide
a
modicum
of
means
until
this
test
litigation
could
be
brought.
the
three
judge
district
court
granted
first
a
temporary
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
residence
requirement
which
then
did
provide
the
necessary
aid.
that
injunction
as
the
court
knows
was
later
made
permanent
and
the
cases
here.
the
decision
below,
i
may
recall,
rested
primarily
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
would
also
emphasize
that
the
decision
in
the
pennsylvania
district
court
was
one
of
far
there
are
many
decisions
by
three
judge
district
courts
all
over
the
country.
there
are
at
least
five
major
opinions
and
decisions
where
the
court
seems
genuinely
to
have
considered
the
case
itself
in
the
last
and
since
the
argument
in
this
case
in
the
opinion
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
in
the
court
which
circuit
judge
aldridge
presided
over.
there
are
also
a
raft
of
temporary
orders
which
i
don't
think
i
can
really
claim
as
authority
because
they
just
followed
what
had
happened
before.
but
nevertheless,
with
the
exception
of
one
case
there's
been
an
extraordinary
uniformity
of
opinions
to
which
i
think
this
court
would
wish
to
give
weigh.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
is
a
little
bit
different
from
that
of
pennsylvania
and
i
want
to
explain
some
of
the
idiosyncrasies
in
its
operation.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
appears
on
page
2
of
the
fattest
of
the
briefs,
the
first
brief
for
the
appellees
in
these
cases.
public
assistance
shall
be
awarded
to
or
on
behalf
of
any
needy
individual
who
either
(a)
has
resided
in
the
district
for
one
year
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
filing
his
application
for
such
assistance,
or
(b)
who
was
born
with
one
--
one
year
immediately
preceding
the
application
for
such
aid,
if
the
parent
or
other
relative
with
whom
the
child
is
living
has
lived
in
the
district
for
a
year.
three
of
the
four
plaintiffs
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
fall
into
the
familiar
--
if
one
is
familiar
with
these
cases'
pattern
illustrated
by
juanita
smith
of
whom
i
spoke
earlier.
that
is
to
say
they
are
mothers
of
dependent
children
without
present
husbands
who
moved
into
the
new
jurisdiction
either
to
go
back
home
for
the
most
part
or
rejoin
their
families
or
to
get
help
from
some
person
or
perhaps
to
get
a
job
and
then
who
are
left
absolutely
destitute
of
when
misfortune
occurs.
two
of
the
district
cases
show
the
--
what
i
call
the
idiosyncrasies
of
this
statute.
one
is
the
case
of
gloria
jean
brown
for
the
most
part
her
saga
is
like
that
of
juanita
smith
that
is
to
say
she
grew
up
in
washington
dc.
she
went
out
of
state
with
children
and
then
she
came
back
to
a
large
family.
i
mean
her
father
and
brothers
insisted
which
was
here.
when
she
was
coming
back,
she
left
the
two
children
she
had
taken
with
her
to
arkansas
there
for
a
month
or
two
while
she
came
back
and
reestablish
empennage
in
which
to
bring
them
up.
then
when
she
found
she
had
to
apply
for
assistance
and
when
her
oldest
child
who
was
here
and
she
both
receive
assistance
under
the
one-year
residence
law,
these
other
two
in
the
same
family
who
certainly
were
in
the
same
situation
and
who
certainly
have
the
same
ties
to
the
district
of
columbia
when
she
did,
were
denied
the
assistance
that
was
given
to
the
oldest
child.
and
the
--
worse
than
that,
the
little
baby
in
the
family
not
being
a
year-old
hadn't
resided
in
the
district
for
a
year
so
it
will
--
too
was
held
not
to
have
the
same
connection
as
its
mother
and
older
brother.
really
still
my
idiosyncratic
was
the
case
which
i
understood
counsel
just
to
withdraw
the
case
of
vera
barley
who
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
even
if
they
have
conceded
in
this,
it
shows
the
operation
of
these
laws
who
came
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
1943
and
she
was
coming
back
to
a
place
where
she
lived
before
so
not
for
very
long
even
then.
she
had
the
misfortune
to
become
incompetent.
she
was
confined
to
st.
elizabeth's.
she
was
in
st.
elizabeth's
for
29
years.
if
public
assistance
could
be
provided
to
her,
she
was
determined
by
the
doctors
to
be
competent
to
be
released
and
arrangements
were
made
to
--
for
her
living
in
a
nursing
home
here.
but
the
district
said
no,
she
hadn't
one
year's
residence,
so
she
had
to
stay
in
st.
elizabeth's.
a
good
deal
has
been
said
about
saving
money
in
these
cases.
it
costs
roughly
three
times
as
much
to
keep
her
in
st.
elizabeth
as
it
would've
kept
to
provide
the
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
let
her
go
to
a
home.
i
may
say
that
that
is
also
true
of
many
of
these
children
for
whom
the
only
future
under
the
one-year
residence
rule
was
going
to
institutional
care,
which
is
more
expensive
per
child
on
the
average
than
the
aid
under
the
adc
programs.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recall
that
being
stated
and
argued
as
a
general
matter.
but
we
do
not,
as
i
understand
it.
i
have
checked
this
afternoon.
but
i
believe
we
have
no
reliable
figures
indeed
no
figures
at
all
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
argument
--
the
argument
that
i
make,
i
would
remind
your
honor,
is
composed
of
three
parts.
one
is
the
discrimination
and
the
other
is
discrimination
aimed
at
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right
--
liberty,
the
liberty
of
travel,
and
three,
the
absence
of
any
justification
in
state
policy.
i
think
a
much
stronger
case
can
be
made
for
requiring
a
period
of
residence
in
a
state,
but
before
you're
permitted
to
take
part
in
its
affairs,
that
you
learn
what
the
issues
are,
learn
something
about
the
nature
of
the
community
or
learn
something
about
the
parties,
candidates
and
their
past
record.
therefore,
i
would
think
it
was
a
much
stronger
basis
for
arguing.
in
that
case,
that
the
differentiation
between
old
and
new
residence
serves
a
useful
purpose.
i
shall
argue
here
taking
them
up
one
at
a
time
that
none
of
the
justifications
advanced
for
this
statute.
stand
up
that
this
differentiation
not
only
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
is
discourages,
penalizes
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
liberty,
freedom
of
movement,
but
that
it
lacks
that
justification.
that
would
be
my
--
i
think
--
in
other
words,
each
residence
requirement
must
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
what
--
is
there
some
reasonable
basis?
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
your
voting
case
for
that
reason
is
quite
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
we're
--
you're
quite
right
and
i
stated
it,
i
think,
the
way
i
meant
to
in
the
beginning
that
this
divides
residence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
within
the
hew
definition
that
your
honor
referred
to
earlier
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
into
two
categories
and
that
we
say
is
the
invidious
classification.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
in
the
case
of
the
other
requirements
for
eligibility,
yes
precisely.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
connecticut
statute
very
briefly.
connecticut
statute
on
page
36
of
the
connecticut
brief
is
a
little
bit
different
from
the
pennsylvanian
district
statutes.
and
the
difference
is
worth
noticing
along
with
one
matter
of
fact.
the
connecticut
statute
is
the
very
last
page
in
the
brief
in
the
connecticut
case.
when
any
person
comes
into
this
state
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future
and
applies
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future,
and
applies
for
aid
to
dependent
children,
you'll
notice
this
applies
only
to
afdc
and
not
to
other
categories
of
the
system.
within
one
year
from
his
arrival,
such
person
shall
be
eligible
only
for
temporary
aid
or
care
until
arrangements
are
made
for
his
return.
under
the
regulations
of
the
connecticut
welfare
department,
the
requirement
of
visible
means
of
support
are
means
that
you
must
either
have
a
specific
job
offer
or
resources,
money
or
property
that
will
last
you
for
three
months.
or,
if
you're
able
to
get
and
keep
a
job
for
three
months,
that
too
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
now,
i
do
not
intend
to
go
into
the
case
of
the
connecticut
plaintiff
in
any
detail.
i
do
want
to
say
just
one
thing
and
that
is
that
it
was
clearly
stipulated.
it's
on
page
41a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
appellant.
because
of
her
pregnancy
and
her
responsibilities
to
her
son,
the
plaintiff
was
unable
to
seek
--
either
to
seek
gainful
employment
or
enroll
in
a
work
training
program.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
most
misplaced
in
this
case
to
talk
about
people
who
are
unwilling
to
enter
the
labor
force.
this
is
a
plaintiff,
who
at
the
time
when
this
claim
was
made,
was
unable
because
of
her
pregnancy
and
her
responsibilities
to
her
son
to
enter
the
workforce
or
seek
training.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
number
of
the
states
will
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
number
of
the
states
will
supply
aid
if
you
go
back
home
and
indeed
in
--
or
if
the
court
should
direct
itself
to
the
question,
“how
far
does
this
deter
taking
up
a
new
residence
as
distinguished
from
how
far
does
it
penalize
one
who
insist
on
doing
it
which
i
don't
think
is
important?”
but
should
one
go
into
that,
it's
significant
that
this
puts
pressure
on
people
to
go
back
to
the
other
state
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
connecticut
record,
i'm
afraid
i
have
forgotten
the
figure,
that
a
certain
number
of
people,
when
confronted
with
this
at
the
initial
interview,
having
nothing
else
to
do
or
being
destitute
are
in
effect
pressed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
to
go
back
where
they
came.
and
this,
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
it
was
true
of
all
states,
justice
fortas,
but
it's
a
characteristic
of
many
of
these
programs.
in
coming
back
now
to
my
legal
propositions,
i
shall
direct
myself
first
to
the
unqualified
one
year
prior
residence
requirement
and
then
deal
with
any
peculiarities
of
the
connecticut
case
further
on.
we
picture
our
case
ultimately,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
upon
the
preposition
that
the
one
year's
prior
residence
requirement
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
because
without
any
justification,
say
a
prejudice
against
strangers,
against
new
residence
who
are
poor,
it
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
between
two
groups
of
persons
who
are
otherwise
identically
situated,
let's
say
that
one
of
them
has
chosen
recently
to
exercise
the
fundamental
liberty
to
leave
an
old
environment
and
move
to
a
new
residence
in
search
of
preferred
associations,
opportunities
or
environment.
i
--
i
would
emphasize
that
that
proposition
embraces
three
elements.
first,
that
the
one
year
residence
requirement
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
between
two
classes
of
persons
who
are
identically
situated
in
terms
of
need
or
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
that
is
offered
or
any
other
thing
of
that
kind,
say
how
long
they've
been
there
or
where
they
came
from.
second,
the
sole
basis
of
classification
is
a
differentiation
between
the
new
and
the
old
residence
would
be
all
granted
assistance
and
the
new
denied.
that
discrimination
against
strangers,
against
new
comers,
against
those
who,
mrs.
williams
said
during
her
oral
argument
“are
not
our
people”
which
i
think,
with
no
offense
at
all
to
her
intent,
reveals
that
this
sort
of
rest
on
a
prejudice
against
the
outsiders.
it's
invidious
in
that
sense
like
racial
or
religious
discrimination.
but
it
also
penalizes
the
exercise
of
a,
what
i
take
to
be,
a
liberty
of
freedom
and
aspect
of
freedom
which
has
long
constitutional
recognition.
and
then,
the
third
element
is
that
the
classification
serves
as
no
substantial
relation
to
the
accomplishment
of
any
permissible
state
policy.
under
the
grab
bag
of
justifications
that
the
appellants
put
forward
here
in
their
briefs,
most
of
them,
testimony
to
the
ingenuity
of
counsel,
i
think
it'd
be
shown
really
not
to
stand
up
on
any
careful
analysis.
now,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
this
or
i
think
one
could
argue
that
we
do
argue
in
some
of
our
briefs
that
perhaps
someone
or
two
of
those
three
elements
in
the
case
would
be
enough
to
make
account
a
case
for
unconstitutionality.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
don't
need
to
go
that
far,
that
all
we
need
to
say
is
that
adding
all
three
together,
the
one
year's
prior
residence
requirement
is
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
then
we
developed
each
of
the
three
parts.
but
preliminarily,
i
ought
to
say
that
of
course
the
constitutional
guarantees
against
hostile
or
arbitrary
and
capricious
classifications
apply
to
legislation
conferring
advantages
or
opportunities
or
privileges
just
as
much
as
they
do
to
legislation
that
regulates
our
taxes.
the
obvious
example
would
be
a
state
granted
aid
program
that
discriminated
down
grounds
of
race
or
that
discriminated
down
grounds
of
religion
as
in
sherbert
and
verner.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
which
if
you
read
them
carefully
sustained
this
--
this
proposition
of
the
gerard
college
case
of
evans
and
milton,
simkins
and
moses
cone,
a
fourth
circuit
case
when
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
and
again
the
sherbert
and
verner.
i
think
all
show
that
there
is
nothing
new
in
this
suggestion.
now
on
the
first
of
the
three
elements,
we
suggest,
as
i
say,
that
the
one
year
prior
residence
rule
discriminates
in
relation
to
the
minimum
essentials
of
life
between
persons
who
are
identically
situated
except
for
their
residence.
the
proposition
is
perfectly
simple
and
i
don't
think
anyone
is
going
to
dispute
it.
but
quite
frankly,
i'm
a
--
a
little
worried
that
because
of
its
simplicity,
its
importance
make
it
overlooked.
that's
one
reason
i
stressed
the
facts
that
this
is
a
discrimination
in
regard
between
people
who
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
just
taking
them
one
at
a
time.
i
--
i
emphasize
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
like
to
dispose
of
a
couple
of
little
points.
first
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
all
classifications
are
invalid.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
is
not
--
i'm
suggesting
really
two
things
and
perhaps
i
didn't
state
them
very
well.
i'll
try
to
do
it
more
simply.
i'm
suggesting
that
this
isn't
a
discrimination
or
like
one
or
between
the
business
that
may
claim
it's
entitled
to
a
subsidy
for
$5
million
and
then
that's
unfair
as
compared
to
another
business
of
getting
a
subsidy
of
$20
million.
that
this
is
something
that
operates
in
relation
to,
not
only
the
rudiments
of
existence
in
a
monetary
sense,
but
in
relation
to
such
things
as
keeping
families
together.but
the
answer
to,
when
they
dismiss,
was
the
only
thing
we
can
do
is
put
your
children
in
institutional
care.
in
relation
to
vera
barley,
the
discrimination
operated
literally
in
relation
to
human
liberty.
and
i
think
that
those
aspects
of
it
are
important.
then
the
other
thing
that
i
was
seeking
to
emphasize
along
the
way
is
that
these
people
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
need
and
all
other
things
that
are
relevant
from
the
standpoint
of
the
purposes
of
this
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
resident.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
resident,
we
so
contend.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
hew
definitions,
as
soon
as
he
arrives
and
begins
to
abide
there
with
no
intention
to
leave,
no
intention
immediately
to
leave.
i
would
say
that
the
distinction
is
an
invalid
one
subject
to
the
matter
of
a
--
of
a
period
of
time
to
determine
whether
he
is
a
resident
and
i
would
say
that
the
state
has
no
sufficient
justification
for
discriminating
against
new
comer.
i
will
also
argue,
but
i
would
like
to
postpone
this
till
tomorrow
and
i
get
a
little
farther
on
my
argument.
but
i
will
also
argue,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
even
if
we
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
i
am
wrong
in
saying
that
it
has
no
power
to
take
any
steps,
i
will
argue
that
this
statute
is
overly
broad
for
reasons
i
will
explain
later
in
my
argument
and
that
the
state
could
deal
with
any
problem
which
might,
contrary
to
my
argument,
be
supposed
to
exist
by
an
hour
over
a
piece
of
legislation.
i've
--
i've
just,
if
i
may
to
take
the
one
minute
left,
i
was
emphasizing
that
these
plaintiffs
are
identically
situated
with
respect
to
need
and
anything
that
might
be
thought
relevant
to
determining
need
or
deserts
or
the
suitability
of
a
particular
kind
of
remedy.
the
other
reason
i
stressed
that
is
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
might
be
legitimately
concerned
if
we
were
pressing
it
to
pass
upon
the
reasonability
of
categories
of
aid
as
between
the
deaf
and
the
dumb
and
the
blind
or
as
between
the
widows
of
veterans
and
the
widows
of
civil
service
employee.
but
this
distinction
clearly
has
nothing
to
do
with
deciding
how
to
solve
one
problem
or
how
to
solve
another
problem
or
with
determining
what
is
the
nature
of
the
problem.
but
the
nature
of
the
problem
is
identical
in
the
case
of
the
new
residents
and
the
older
residents.
and
then
i
do
go
on,
justice
fortas,
in
the
morning
from
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
thought
the
show
that
the
classification
made
by
the
one
year
prior
residence
requirement.
between
old
residence,
on
the
one
hand
and
new
residence
on
the
other,
not
only
operates
in
relation
to
the
fundamental
necessities,
rudiments
of
life.
but
also,
that
it
is
utterly
unrelated
to
any
of
the
avowed
purposes
of
the
public
assistance
laws,
because
the
favored
and
the
disfavored
are
identically
situated
in
relation
to
the
kind
or
extended
their
need
or
the
suitability
of
the
adc
program
for
parallel
programs
as
a
remedy.
in
the
absence
of
relation
to
some
irrational
relation
to
some
other
state
policy
therefore,
that
is
enough
to
make
--
re-submit
an
equal
protection
case
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
distinction
between
a
redheaded
man
and
brown
headed
man
or
any
other
capricious
classification.
now,
i
go
on
first
this
morning
to
point
out
that
our
case
is
stronger
still
because
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
has
singled
out
for
the
purposes
of
this
favor
hospital
treatment.
those
who
exercise
the
fundamental
liberty
of
moving
to
a
new
residence
in
pursuit
of
better
opportunities,
better
life
or
what
else
they
considered
to
be
an
advantage.
that
discrimination
we
say,
is
not
merely
capricious
but
it
is
invidious
in
the
same
sense
that
discrimination
on
grounds
of
race
or
religion
is
invidious,
and
it
also
operates
to
deter
the
exercise
of
a
right
which
underlies
a
number
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
of
course,
those
provisions
in
turn,
help
to
show
that
this
is
an
invidious
distinction.
that
is
one
that
our
fundamental
constitutional
principles
condemned.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
this
line
of
thought
brings
me
while
it
relies
on
the
constitutional
provisions
dealing
with
freedom
of
migration.
it
brings
me
back
ultimately
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
to
the
equal
protection
clause
cases.
i
stressed
that
because
i
think
this
analysis
eases
the
court's
problem
of
decision
and
makes
it
unnecessary
to
break
new
constitutional
ground
in
these
cases.
for
example,
one
does
not
have
under
these
circumstances
to
face
up
to
the
question,
what
exact
clause
of
the
constitution
do
you
find
this
in?
equally,
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia's
statute
is
involved
is
not
relevant
when
one
is
talking
about
a
classification
as
invidious
as
this.
whereas,
technically,
it
might
be
of
significance,
if
one
will
rely
on
article
4
section
2
alone
or
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
and
again,
one
does
not
have
to
consider
precisely
how
far
congress
is
entitled
to
define
or
limit
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
united
states
citizens
because
certainly
again,
it
is
subject
in
its
legislation
to
the
due
process
clause.
now,
we
find
the
constitutional
recognition
or
reflection
of
this
basic
liberty.
the
constitutional
condemnation
--
underlying
condemnation
and
discrimination
between
old
--
discrimination
between
old
and
new
residents
in
three
or
four
familiar
clauses
of
the
constitution.
the
first
is
article
4,
section
2,
which
guarantees
the
citizens
of
any
state
should
be
entitled
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
citizens
of
the
several
states.
in
blake
and
mcclung
this
court
pointed
out,
that
the
underlying
phases
of
that
clause
was
that
a
citizen
of
one
state
should
not
be
in
a
condition
of
alienage
when
he
is
within
or
when
he
removed
to
another
state.
i
suggest
the
old
notion
of
the
elizabethan
settlement
laws
was
precisely
that
one
is
in
the
condition
of
alienage
when
it
comes
to
the
new
community.
the
commerce
clause
as
interpreted
in
crandall
and
nevada
and
the
edward's
case
incorporates
or
reflects
at
least
to
some
extent
this
fundamental
notion.
indeed,
it
is
interesting
to
recall
that
while
in
the
edward's
case,
the
court
--
the
majority
opinion,
did
not
consider
how
far
a
state
was
under
an
obligation
to
a
court
the
same
benefits
to
immigrants
that
it
accorded
to
all
their
residents
because
that
was
in
front
of
it.
it
did
point
out
that
the
philosophy
of
the
elizabethan
settlement
laws
is
the
majority
of
opinions
that
is
no
longer
in
accordance
with
the
facts.
third,
we
find
this
basic
notion
again,
reflected
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
was
considerable
discussion
when
the
14th
amendment
was
under
deliberation
by
the
congress
about
the
right
to
move
freely
from
place
to
place,
freedom
of
locomotion.
i
am
not
aware
justice
fortas
although
i
haven't
recently
made
a
detailed
search,
i
must
confess.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
explicit
mention
of
going
from
one
state
to
another
the
discussion
clearly
did
take
place
in
terms
of
movement
where
you
will
and
i
should
supposed
that
fairly
interpreted
that
incorporated
going
from
one
state
to
another.
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
explicit
mention
of
this
before
the
slaughter-house
case.
there,
in
the
majority
opinion,
it
is
stated,
it
was
referenced
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
one
of
the
rights
is
this,
it
“is
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
can,
of
his
own
volition,
become
a
citizen
of
any
state
of
the
union
by
a
bona
fide
residence
therein,
with
the
same
rights
as
other
citizens
of
that
state”
and
in
the
sense
of
course,
this
is
history
because
the
opinion
was
written
within
the
memory
event
who
had
been
alive
and
taking
part
in
affairs
at
the
time
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
under
consideration.
and
finally,
i
recall
that
the
court
--
that
the
guarantee
of
liberty
in
the
due
process
clause
has
been
cited
by
such
distinguished
scholars
as
zechariah
chafee
or
as
a
source
of
the
right
to
move
from
state
to
state
and
as
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
curtail
that
right.
now
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
discrimination,
not
only
is
capricious
in
the
sense
that
i
argued
yesterday,
but
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
those
who
are
exercising
a
constitutional
liberty,
i
suggest
that
a
decision
condemning
that
discrimination
would
be
in
accordance
with
settled
constitutional
principles.
unless
of
course,
and
i
now
come
to
the
last
point,
unless
it
can
be
shown
to
bear
a
rational
relationship
to
some
state
objective
other
than
that
set
forth
in
the
legislation,
because
its
perfectly
clear
that
this
discrimination
does
not
fulfill
any
of
the
objectives
set
forth
in
the
legislation.
in
considering
the
various
justifications
that
have
been
advanced,
i
would
like
to
start
by
clearing
the
under
branch,
there
are
numbers
that
seemed
to
me,
to
one
can
dispose
of
very
quickly,
while
there
are
others
that
perhaps
requires
somewhat
further
discussion.
first,
it
is
said
that
this
one
year
is
delay;
this
discrimination
is
an
aid
in
budgeting
for
a
subsequent
year.
no
one
has
suggested
how
this
aid's
budgeting.
and
i
must
confess
although,
i
maybe
wrong
because
i
have
never
made
up
a
welfare
budget,
i
can't
see
how
it
would
aid
budgeting.
no
one
has
a
census
of
the
people
who
come
in
during
a
year,
who
may
go
on
welfare
which
they
can
later
use
as
a
basis
for
knowing
who
will
be
added
to
the
roads
for
next
year.
indeed
it
is
my
impression
that
no
one
has
a
census
of
the
number
of
people
who
move
in
to
a
state
in
any
particular
year
even
in
(inaudible)
at
least
not
ordinarily.
but
so
that
the
figures
that
might
make
the
projection
somewhat
easier
simply
aren't
available.
second,
there
are
other
elements
that
enter
into
the
prediction
of
the
sides
of
the
welfare
roads
such
as
the
value
of
employment
and
other
things
of
that
kind.
it
would
overwhelm
the
significance
of
this
relatively
small
figure
of
the
number
of
people
who
have
become
bona
fide
residents
who
haven't
been
there
a
year
and
finally,
i
suggest
that
under
carrington
and
rash
and
similar
decisions
of
this
court,
the
slight
administrative
aid
in
convenience
in
budgeting
even
if
it
existed
would
not
be
adequate
to
justify
discrimination
as
severe
and
hostile
as
this.
second
that
is
said,
that
this
discrimination
is
justified
because
it
will
prevent
people
from
presenting
fraudulent
claims
to
two
or
more
states.
there's
absolutely
no
showing
of
any
likelihood
of
this
kind
of
fraud.
the
total
errors
checks
indicate
in
the
adc
payments
for
all
kinds
of
eligibility
run
around
3%
while
a
number
of
errors
in
fraud
by
making
paid
claims
onto
a
state
would
be
fantastically
small
and
i
may
add
that
there
other
--
other
checks
and
sources
of
money
of
course
are
made
and
this
could
be
checked
along
with
that.
a
weight
of
deal,
i
think,
to
illustrate
how
farfetched
this
argument
is,
is
to
suppose
that
a
state
where
to
make
it
crime,
i
guess
it
is
to
seek
welfare
in
two
jurisdictions.
and
in
order
to
enact
the
subsection
saying,
whoever
applies
for
aid
within
one
year
of
moving
into
the
state
shall
be
presumed
to
be
committing
fraud
by
seeking
payments
from
two
states.
even
a
prima
facie
rebuttable
presumption
of
that
kind
without
unquestionably
be
struck
down
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
same
way
as
in
thought
against
the
united
states
and
other
cases
of
that
kind.
and
finally
on
this
point,
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
in
principle
squarely
the
kind
of
thing
that
oyama
forbids,
that
there
that
was
created
in
arbitrary
presumption
that
one
was
circumventing
the
california
laws
but
with
respect
to
who
may
hold
agriculture
premises
and
the
court
said
that
california
could
not
create
an
invidious
discrimination
against
the
american
citizens
of
japanese
decent.
in
order
to
deal
with
the
few
cases
of
fraud,
that
might
otherwise
be
involved.
third,
it
is
suggesting
that
this
rule
provides
an
objective
test
of
residence
over
this
in
the
district
of
columbia
brief
and
it
was
suggested
by
judge
holtzoff.
i
think
at
this
point
one
has
to
be
very
careful
about
what
he
means
when
he
says
that
the
requirement
of
one
year
residence
provides
an
objective
test
of
residency.
residence
under
the
social
security
laws
means
residence
means
presence
in
the
state,
living
there,
not
for
a
temporary
purpose.
in
other
words,
without
the
intention
of
going
somewhere
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
would
then
be
a
resident
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it
would
then
be
a
--
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
think
of
someone
doing
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
still
qualified
--
no,
oh
no,
and
--
and
still
qualify
for
aid
to
dependent
children,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
very
money
spent
going
back
and
forth.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i
suggest
it
is
in
the
common
thing
in
relation
to
the
types
of
people
we
are
talking
about
here
or
but
in
that
event,
i
would
say
that
if
the
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
its
--
perhaps
i
am
wrong
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i'm
--
i'm
prepared
to
answer
your
question
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
such
--
such
a
person
under
our
position,
i'm
going
to
answer
you
squarely.
such
a
person
under
our
position
would
be
entitled
to
aid
six
months
in
massachusetts
and
six
months
in
florida.
and
that
is
squarely
the
argument
that
we
made,
and
it
seems
to
be
me
that
that's
entirely
appropriate
effectively
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
quite.
and
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
case
that
falls
suitable
to
the
kind
of
aid
that
is
being
talked
about.
but
once
those
facts
appeared
as
justice
black's
states
them,
although,
i
think
that
will
be
the
most
extraordinary.
i
don't
mean
to
shriek
from
answering
you
but
they
would
be
entitled
to
aid
in
both
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
hope
not
mr.
justice.
the
part
that
i
want
to
emphasize
with
respect
to
this
test
of
residence
is
that
one
must
ask
what
is
it
that
you
are
trying
to
test.
i
think
that
it
lurks
behind
that
expression
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
came
out
in
mr.
barton's
argument
yesterday.
the
notion
that
we
are
really
asking
more
permanency
than
being
in
the
state
voluntarily
with
no
intention
of
living
and
if
to
the
extent
that
something
more
lurks
there
but
then
our
answer
is
simply
that
requiring
to
something
more
is
itself
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
classification.
to
the
extent
that
this
is
meant,
the
justification
is
alleged
as
being
and
just
providing
a
test
of
who
is
a
resident
in
the
sense
of
which
the
hew
uses
the
term
and
the
welfare
laws
use
the
term,
that
is
voluntary
presence
with
no
intention
to
go.
then
we
say,
again
this
is
--
it
isn't
a
good
test.
it's
utterly
--
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
say
that
whoever
has
lived
in
the
state
must
be
presumed
to
have
an
intention
of
presently
living
in
the
state.
we
just
know
that
isn't
so
and
of
course,
there
is
no
better
proof
that
isn't
so
in
many,
many
instances
than
these
records.
certainly
little
shawn
brown,
the
baby,
who
haven't
been
born
for
more
than
a
year
ago
had
no
greater
intention
to
live
the
district
of
columbia
than
his
mother
and
the
oldest
member
of
the
family,
who
qualified
for
the
aid.
certainly,
juanita
smith,
the
young
woman
who
had
--
who's
family
for
generations
had
lived
in
pennsylvania
got
away
for
a
few
years
and
then
came
back
to
rejoin
her
own
family,
which
she'd
promise
to
look
out
for
can't,
be
said
to
have
been
likely
to
be
planning
to
leave
pennsylvania
just
because
she'd
been
away
for
a
short
time.
i
mentioned
in
one
other
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
bear
out
this
point
but
illustrate
some
others.
the
other
plaintiff
from
the
pennsylvania
case
was
jose
foster.
she
had
four
children,
had
been
on
aid
in
pennsylvania.
the
reason
she
left
to
go
to
south
carolina
was
to
take
care
of
some
old
aged
and
sick
parents,
and
as
long
as
she,
which
incidentally
involved
to
cut
in
any
welfare
benefits.
after
they
reached
the
point
where
she
could
no
longer
help
them,
she
went
back
to
pennsylvania,
were
now
to
presume
because
she
hadn't
been
back
a
year
that
she
intended
to
live
again
is
i
submit
to
you,
utterly
absurd.
again,
i
think
if
this
was
stated
in
the
form
of
a
presumption,
it
should
be
presumed
that
any
person
who
hasn't
been
a
resident
for
a
year
intends
to
live
or
is
a
drifter.
that
one
would
say,
of
course,
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
it's
equally
arbitrary
and
capricious
when
it's
advanced
as
a
test.
i
would
add
two
more
points
although,
i
think
they're
unnecessary.
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
where
there
is
an
elaborate
process
of
verification
with
respect
to
other
conditions
of
eligibility
involving
not
only
elaborate
questionnaires
or
visits
to
the
home,
surveillance
in
many
jurisdictions,
checking
on
references.
if
that
can
be
done
with
the
respect
to
other
conditions
of
eligibility
but
it
certainly
can
be
done
with
equal
ease
with
respect
to
this
better,
of
whether
the
signs
of
the
person
intends
to
live,
and
so
again
i
suggest
that
the
cases
like
carrington
and
yet
rash
and
oyama
and
california,
harman
and
forssenius,
all
sustain
our
position
that
this
won't
do
as
a
justification.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
point
i
confess
your
honor,
i
hadn't
thought
of,
but
it
seems
to
me
and
to
be
entirely
valid,
it
also
does
recall
to
my
mind
another
point
and
that
is
of
course
the
person
who
does
the
leave
the
former
state.
if
this
rule
can
stand,
it's
likely
to
fall
into
a
gap,
and
not
get
welfare
anyway.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
retaining
your
rights
in
the
place
that
you
have
left.
the
last
of
the
arguments
that
i
regard
is
very
easily
brushed
aside
is
the
suggestion
that
the
purpose
is
to
limit
assistance
to
those
who
have
made
a
contribution
to
the
community
or
who
have
some
investment
in
the
community.
well
i
don't
how
we
measure
the
matter
of
contribution
or
investment
in
the
community.
i
suggest
that
this
is
really
a
euphemistic
way
of
expressing
the
same
discrimination
against
strangers
or
outsiders.
i
don't
see
how
in
the
brown
family,
anybody
can
say
that
one
of
the
children
and
the
mother
had
an
investment
in
washington
or
had
made
a
contribution
to
the
washington
and
the
others
haven't.
but
remember,
we're
talking
basically
here
about
the
aid
to
dependent
children
and
the
whole
notion
of
investment
in
the
community.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
said
before
to
be
simply
euphemism.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
voting?
eligibility
for
professions.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
presents
a
different
problem,
i
don't
mean
by
my
tone
of
voice
to
imply
that
they
are
all
constitutional
then
they've
been
held
unconstitutional.
i
haven't
thought
of
a
case
in
that
category
justice
stewart
where
this
would
be
a
permissible
consideration
but
maybe
that
there
is
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
a
knowledge
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we're
using
--
i
was
using
investment
in
more
in
the
sense
of
what
one
had
contributed
to
the
community
and
was
not
focusing
as
you
suggest
on
concern
for
the
community,
interest
in
the
character
of
the
community.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
in
the
latter
case
this
might
well
be
justifying
consideration.
but
i
suggest
it
is
not
relevant
here,
because
there
is
no
--
i
don't
think
one
can
use
this
kind
of
benefit
any
more
than
one
may
use
schools
or
fire
or
police
protection,
as
a
reward
for
what
people
have
been
supposed
to
contribute.
i
would
say
that
the
emphasis
was
on
the
knowledge
and
familiarity
with
the
problems
in
--
that
you
do
express
opinion
on
and
choose
candidates
to
deal
with
that
was
relevant
if
voting
the
residence
requirement
is
to
be
justified.
mr.
archibald
cox
precisely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
indeed,
we
would
stress
that
point
in
addition
to
the
one
that
has
already
been
mentioned.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
think
i
have
thought
to
stress
as
the
basic
right,
the
right
to
live
where
you
please.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
journey
or
to
make
a
pleasure,
to
swing
around
the
country
or
to
go
europe
is
a
--
raises
different
problems
and
is
a
lesser
right
i
would
think.
and
my
case,
your
honor,
emphasize
of
why
i
should
have
made
more
sharply
perhaps.
our
case
deals
with
the
right
to
live
where
you
please,
to
seek
better
opportunities.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
agree
indeed.
i
--
i
would
urge
that
that
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
our
submission.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
except
that
the
constitution
itself
introduces
that
distinction
that
it
occurred
to
and
perhaps
will
occur
to
your
honor
that
this
rather
like
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
connection
with
the
apportionment
cases
about
the
senate
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
is,
that
the
constitution
itself
says
that
qualification
to
vote
for
local
people
shall
be
the
standard
of
qualification
to
vote
for
the
president.
now
whether
the
congress
could
change
that
or
not,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
the
constitution
--
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
i
don't
that
i
can
argue
that
the
equal
protection
clause
repeals
the
provision
of
the
constitution,
dealing
with
the
qualifications
of
electives
for
the
presidency
and
the
constitution
itself
says,
that
those
who
should
be
qualified
to
vote
for
president,
shall
be
those
qualified
to
vote
for
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature.
and
in
terms
of
that
consideration,
as
suggested
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
stewart,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
an
argument,
i
don't
have
to
either
espouse
or
reject
it,
but
there
is
an
argument
not
present
here
that
goes
to
justify
the
rationality
of
the
classification
for
that
purpose
and
then
the
other
clause
about
qualifications
for
president
operates
on
it
automatically.
so
that
--
i
think
your
honor's
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
a
very
analogous
one
if
it
weren't
for
perhaps,
what
today
seems
like
an
odd
constitutional
query
and
my
answer,
were
it
not
for
that
quirk,
i
suspect
would
have
to
be
very
different
although,
i
don't
want
to
pin
myself
to
it.
now
there's
a
group
of
(inaudible)
that
i
want
to
lump
together
because
once
again,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
be
exact
about
in
our
terminology.
it
is
said
in
this
group
of
(inaudible)
that
the
state
might
protect
its
financial
possession
that
it
may
deter
the
poor
from
entering
the
state
and
that
it
may
prevent
the
movement
of
indigents
into
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
securing
welfare
payments.
again,
i
think
one
has
to
be
exact
about
what
it
means
to
the
extent
that
this
is
simply
an
argument
that
it
would
cost
us
traditional
money
to
give
welfare
to
residents
for
less
than
a
year.
but
the
answer
is
that
the
cause
won't
excuse
a
classification
which
otherwise
violates
the
constitution.
a
state
could
say
that
discrimination
against
black
mothers
and
children
would
save
us
money,
but
nobody
would
think
of
advancing
that
as
a
justification
for
the
invidious
and
hostile
classification
or
discrimination
on
grounds
of
religion
that
might
save
money,
probably
save
south
carolina
a
little
bit
of
money
in
sherbert
and
verner.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
except
again,
i
point
out
that
ours
isn't
barely
capricious,
it's
invidious
or
hostile.
but
the
point
your
honor
(inaudible),
of
course
true.
i
do
think
in
view
of
the
figures
that
have
been
cited
to
the
court
however,
it
might
be
pertinent
for
me
to
take
just
a
minute
to
say
something
about
the
matter
of
cost
here.
although,
i
don't
want
to
retreat
from
my
position,
that
it's
constitutionally
irrelevant.
i
think
in
view
of
the
arguments,
the
court
might
be
concerned.
the
effect
of
the
deletion
of
the
residence
requirements
obviously
will
differ
very
greatly
from
state
to
state
because
of
the
current
trends
of
migration.
and
i
must
also
make
it
very
clear
that
in
my
judgment
of
figures
on
this
are
hard
to
come
by
and
are
not
all
together
reliable.
i
don't
want
to
seem
to
be
saying
to
the
court
anything
more
than
here's
the
best
indication
we
have.
in
pennsylvania,
the
welfare
authorities
estimated
that
the
elimination
of
the
requirement
would
add
one
half
of
one
percent
in
public
assistance,
chiefly
adc.
a
point
of
fact
during
the
period
in
which
the
injunction
was
operating
and
therefore
the
requirement
couldn't
be
applied.
the
increase
i
am
told
will
grant
only
half
of
that,
one
quarter
or
one
percent.
in
connecticut,
the
figures
is
somewhat
more,
that's
a
state
where
--
what
they
and
other
concerns
advertise
very
widely
all
over
new
england
that
looking
for
people
to
work
there,
and
people
who
are
coming
into
connecticut
to
getting
jobs
and
then
encountering
misfortune.
there,
the
figures
seemed
to
be
slightly
less
than
two
percent,
1.7
on
one
period
of
time
when
connecticut
had
no
residence
requirement
and
1.9
on
another
set
of
figures.
illinois,
our
information
is
that
during
two
months
in
which
the
operation
of
the
residence
requirement
of
the
state
that
it
was
something
less
than
3%
of
the
applications,
not
the
people
on
the
roles
of
the
applications
which
would
be
a
much
lesser
figure
that
came
from
people
who
haven't
been
resident
for
a
year.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
applications
of
people
who
haven't
been
in
the
district
a
year
during
the
past
nine
months
have
run
in
the
neighborhood
of
8%,
a
little
over
8%.
so
that's
one
way
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
percentage
of
new
applicants
has
run
to
a
little
more
than
8%.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
have
the
exact
figures.
it
runs
to
--
it
would
take
me
a
minute
to
dig
it
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
--
it's
800
--
it's
running
about
a
thousand
a
year
but
this
is
out
of
the
total
new
applications
during
the
year,
is
8
and
a
fraction
percent.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they
were
put
together
very
recently.
i'd
be
glad
to
supply
them
or
you
can
find
them
in
the
morning
paper
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
we're
not
too
exact
with
the
general
figures.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
i
said
there
that
--
no
--
oh
no,
many
more
than
a
thousand
--
mr.
archibald
cox
many
more.
well
i
must
have
misspoke
myself.
i
meant
to
say
that
there
have
been
745
applications
from
those
who
have
not
been
resident
a
year
in
the
first
eight
months
of
1968.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
about
8%
of
all
new
applications
during
that
period
and
out
of
those
745,
about
half
were
approved.
now,
if
you
move
to
another
state,
maryland,
with
the
reported
figures
there
are
way
down
and
the
order
is
something
around
2%.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
any
for
those
states.
i
doubt
very
much
that
throughout
--
because
i
remember
these
figures
that
have
been
hastily
put
together
in
an
effort
to
make
a
guess
to
what
the
impact
of
this
would
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
my
--
we're
talking
i
think
about
two
different
sets
of
figures
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
your
honor
would
find
that
in
terms
of
people
who
end
up
with
adc
care,
that
it's
the
district
of
columbia
and
new
york
city
that
would
be
the
highest
states
or
because
there
the
flow
of
migration
of
the
people
who
end
up
with
adc
care
is
for
the
most
part
from
the
rural
areas
and
very
largely
from
the
south
into
those
areas.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
this
shows
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suggest
to
you
the
explanation
is
that
the
general
movement
of
population
is
not
the
same
as
the
movement
of
the
population
that
ends
up
or
as
i
put
it,
on
the
adc
role
that
these
had
indeed
--
i
can't
help
suggesting
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
character
of
this
discrimination
against
new
residents.
the
story
from
the
new
york
times,
it
was
distributed
by
counsel
for
the
appellees
yesterday,
has
as
its
headline,
south
fostering
relief
rise
here
and
i
think
the
implication,
the
effect
of
south
fostering
relief
rise
here
and
in
fact
the
connection
between
this
and
the
residence
requirement
in
many
jurisdictions
is
quite
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
there
was
a
different
case
but
my
answer
would
be
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
other
words,
i
do
recognize
the
difference
between
a
resource
that
is
fixed
and
there
can
be
only
so
many
that
i
can
imagine
cases
where
that
might
be
impermissible
consideration.
but
my
answer
has
replied
to
your
honor's
case
would
be
just
the
same
as
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
now
we're
getting
very
close
to
toomer
and
witsell
and
when
you
say
for
the
people
of
the
state,
your
honor
is
suggesting
the
distinction
that
we
are
concerned
with.
you're
suggesting
a
distinction
between
the
residents
and
non-residents,
we're
drawing
at
this
--
we're
saying
you
may
not
draw
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
residents.
but
the
state's
resources
and
keeping
the
state's
natural
resources
within
the
state
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
somewhat
different
problem.
i
think
our
case
is
more
like
the
case
put
by
justice
douglas
yesterday
of
saying,
“we're
going
to
exclude
the
children
of
new
comers
from
the
schools.”
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
the
out-of-state
tuition
differs
in
a
number
of
respects.
in
the
first
place,
you
are
dealing
not
with
one
of
the
basic
necessities
in
life,
college
education,
important
as
it
is,
isn't
quite
in
that
classification
yet.
but
second,
you're
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
just
think
that
whether
you
preserve
the
family
or
whether
people
have
food
or
shelter
over
their
heads
or
whether
they
go
free,
like
(inaudible)
is
more
fundamental,
more
important
to
human
existence
than
one
that
had
--
whether
one
has
the
benefit
of
a
college
education
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
suggest
that
it
may
be
although
i
don't
have
to
decide
the
college
education
case.
then
i
think
there
are
two
other
factors
in
the
college
education
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
generally.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
well
i
suggest
that
that
is
one
possible
distinction
and
it
entirely
tenable,
i
think
as
tenable
one,
i
think
the
constitution
is
concerned
with
differences
of
degree.
i
think
a
second
possible
distinction
is
that
when
you're
talking
of
college
students,
you're
talking
of
people
who
go
into
the
state.
it's
rather
likely
non-resident
hunter
that
justice
white
and
i
would
describe.
the
student
goes
in
simply
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
this
education.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
he
has
such
a
case,
and
there
are
students
who
have
such
case,
then
i
think,
he
may
well
be
able
to
attack
successfully
the
discrimination
against
him
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief
including
a
case
in
iowa
which
hold
that
that
kind
of
discrimination
is
unconstitutional.
but
that
is
different
from
the
man
who
goes
to
berkeley
or
ucla
or
harvard
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
education
(voice
overlap)
--
then
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
will
if
ever
we
have
them.
they're
--
they're
hard
to
come
by
and
i
know
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
right,
we
will
certainly
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
these
depends
the
availability
of
the
figures
we're
speaking
about
mr.
chief
justice.
we'll
try
to
get
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
depend
on
their
having
been
any
injunction,
staying
the
application
of
the
residence
requirement
and
then
on
the
people
having
kept
the
figures
in
the
welfare
agency.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
the
genuine
migrant
presented
a
different
problem.
but
here,
are
talking
about
someone
who
is
not
moving
from
place
to
place.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
your
honor
that
there
isn't
ground
for
a
constitutional
attack
in
those
cases,
but
i
do
suggest
that
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
what
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
if
we
were
to
lose
these
cases?
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
would
think
clearly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
think
clearly,
it
would
even
enable
connecticut
to
say
that
it
would
not
admit
to
the
schools
in
greenwich
and
other
places
near
new
york.
the
children
or
people
who
move
out
from
new
york
to
greenwich
because
there
are
better
schools
there.
now
i
do
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
related
to
the
school
system
which
i
am
familiar
with
where
perhaps
in
my
town,
i
don't
think
well
of
the
public
school
and
i
want
to
send
my
child
to
the
public
school
in
the
next
town
of
(inaudible)
but
there,
i
think
another
factor
comes
into
play
and
that
is,
that
the
--
in
that
case,
where
the
payment
may
be
regarded
--
or
as
and
this
is
another
application
of
the
college
case,
may
be
regarded
as
roughly
related
to
the
amount
of
contribution
that
i
and
my
family
would
make
directly
or
indirectly
in
texas
to
the
schools
in
wayland
and
i
ought
to
do
something
roughly
equal
if
i'm
going
to
send
my
child
to
(inaudible)
and
again
of
course,
it's
a
distinction
between
residents
and
non-residents
and
not
what
we
have
a
discrimination
between
residents.
but
i'll
make
since
my
time
has
jumped
ahead,
we
spent
so
much
time
on
the
figures.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
perhaps.
there
is
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
jumping
ahead.
we
argue
two
more
things
with
respect
to
this
poor
people
moving
into
the
state.
first,
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
move
in
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
welfare
requirements.
and
if,
your
honors
as
we
look
at
this
newspaper
story
that
was
given
to
you
by
our
counsel
through
appellees.
you'll
see
that
the
main
points
it
stresses
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
do
not
move
for
that
purpose
mr.
archibald
cox
we
had
--
i
had
hoped
to
have
time
to
develop
the
figures.
all
the
evidence
we
have
tends
to
show
that
there
has
been
very
little
movement
for
this
purpose,
but
the
point
i
think,
the
important
point
to
emphasize
is
that
the
appellees
who
invoke
this
justification
have
nothing
to
support
and
i
suggest
that
in
dealing
with
a
discrimination
or
with
respect
to
the
fundamental
necessities
of
life
and
it
runs
against
the
stranger
who
is
likely
to
be
the
victim
of
invidious
treatment
and
in
dealing
with
a
discrimination
against
those
who
are
outside
the
state
and
who
are
because
of
their
poverty
are
not
fully
represented
in
the
political
process.
it's
something
more
than
common
assertion
is
necessary
to
show
that
people
go
into
the
state
for
this
purpose.
i
would
like
for
--
i
may
to
say
just
two
more
sentences.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
additional
point
that
i
would
make
that
while
i
think
no
discrimination
can
be
justified
on
the
assumption
that
the
higher
relief
payment
operates
has
a
magnet
and
i
would
stick
on
that
ground.
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
if
it'd
be
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
a
state
might
deal
with
this
problem
in
an
appropriate
way,
that
this
way
of
dealing
with
it
is
unconstitutional
or
because
it
is
excessively
broad
and
not
to
measure,
at
least,
restrictive
of
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
liberty.
i
point
out
that
it's
excessively
broad
in
a
number
of
respects.
first,
it
applies
the
one
year
residence
requirement
even
to
people
who
have
come
from
states
with
lower
or
equal
benefit
levels.
even
to
people
who
have
come
from
states
with
higher
or
equal
benefit
levels
and
indeed
that
what
finds
the
residence
requirement
more
uniformly
in
the
states
that
have
the
lowest
benefit
levels.
second,
it
applies
to
people
who
come
for
reasons
that
demonstrably
are
unrelated
to
the
benefit
level
and
the
facts
to
these
cases
are
the
best
illustration
of
that.
well,
five
out
of
seven
were
coming
back
where
they've
lived
before,
another
five
out
of
seven
were
coming
to
join
families
and
of
course,
most
people
moved
for
hope
for
jobs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
with
this,
i
think
that's
true.
there's
no
--
no
doubt
that
is
a
political
matter
or
as
a
policy
matter
of
a
uniform
payment
would
be
highly
deserved.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
of
course
that
itself,
in
itself,
would
eliminate
any
problem
with
this
kind.
the
third
respect
in
which
i
suggest
that
this
particular
requirement
is
to
demonstratively
too
broad
is
that,
in
addition
to
the
other
two,
is
it
if
when
really
we're
concerned
with
this,
it
could
be
cured
by
saying
that
the
new
comer
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
only
the
benefits
of
the
state
from
which
he
came.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
fairly
undesirable.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
and
i
think,
if
the
problem
of
dealing
with
people
who
come
from
another
state
is
a
justification
for
classifications
which
would
otherwise
be
impermissible,
then
i
suggest,
that
it
will
justify
the
other
kind
of
classification
that
you
call
attention
to
and
is
not
as
severe
as
the
one
that
is
being
imposed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
comes
to,
but
if
i
assume
the
reverse
of
my
basic
contention,
i
do
suggest
seriously
that
this
is
a
(inaudible)
or
less
restrictive
measures
that
raises
no
other
constitutional
problem.
i'll
take
advantage
of
the
five
minutes
just
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
other
fact
but
also,
i
have
really
completed
my
argument.
there
was
a
talk
yesterday
about
the
welfare
freeze
that
takes
effect
with
respect
to
adc
aid
of
july
1,
1969
unless
it's
put
off
again
as
it
has
been
before.
without
going
into
all
the
complexities,
the
congress
made
two
exceptions
to
that.
one
was
to
cover
--
people
added
to
the
roles
because
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith
and
king,
king
against
smith.
and
second,
it
provided
an
exception
to
take
care
of
the
resident's
cases
in
the
event
that
the
judgments
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed,
but
so
that
there
is
no
problem
of
the
operation
of
the
freeze
and
the
decision
in
these
cases
of
creating
a
need
for
new
legislation.
also,
i
don't
think
really
that
would
justify
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
