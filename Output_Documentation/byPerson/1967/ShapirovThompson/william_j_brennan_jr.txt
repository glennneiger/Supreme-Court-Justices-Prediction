justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
want
to
suggest
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
i
gather
your
(inaudible)
of
state
remedies
available
for
this
purpose
and
that
one
year
reputation
makes
it
possible
to
take
care
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
other
states
have
provisions
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
so
many
dollars
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really?
are
you
saying
anything
more
than
that
if
connecticut
disqualifies
this
lady
for
no
reason
except
that
she's
not
been
in
the
state
for
one
year,
otherwise
she'd
be
qualified
as
everyone
else
who's
been
in
the
state
over
a
year
would
be
qualified.
constitutionally,
your
equal
protection
argument
is
that
cannot
be
done,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
really
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
nuances
of
what
is
residence
or
domiciliary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
total
exclusion.
no
and
in
fact
it
wasn't.
it
wasn't
total
exclusion.
in
fact,
the
act
was
directed
--
the
criminal
statute
was
directed
against
to
the
person
to
move
someone
in
and
not
the
person
who
is
coming
and
certainly
at
the
time
that
the
action
was
brought,
the
person
have
to
be
in
the
state
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
appellee
was
in
the
state
of
connecticut
when
this
action
was
brought
in.
and
the
court
made
it
clear
that
where
a
state
that
has
it
as
its
purpose
and
the
basic
effect
to
the
statute
is
to
exclude
indigent
persons
from
the
state
that
that
statute
is
impermissible.
now,
my
final
point
is
also
a
--
the
broader
equal
protection
argument
and
that
is
the
one
that
there
is
a
distinction
drawn
between
persons
who
have
been
here
for
one
year
and
the
persons
who
have
not
--
and
we
would
just
say
that
that
is
arbitrary
and
unsupportive
on
the
constitution.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
have
our
cases
suggested
that
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
the
right
to
travel
was
a
first
amendment
guarantee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
contrary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
because
it
is
--
there
is
a
broader
latitude
to
the
government
with
the
state
or
federal
to
regulate
the
right
travel
and
that
would
be
to
regulate
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech
--
is
that
your
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
also
said
i
think
that
ms.
brown,
is
that
her
name,
came
here
because
in
fort
smith,
arkansas
there
was
not
available
with
public
housing
that
would
be
available
here,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
i
gather
your
position
that
it
doesn't
rest
on
the
reasons
why
people
came
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
take
you
to
from
the
first
to
the
ninth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
you
mean
quite
by
strict
scrutiny.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
usually,
when
you're
talking
with
the
first
amendment
area,
you'll
talk
about
justifications,
terms
of
governmental
reasons
as
compelling
state
reasons.
that's
what
--
are
there
areas
where
you
don't
search
for
compelling
state
reasons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox,
you
mean
there
are
a
thousand
new
applications
a
year
and
since
the
suspension
of
the
directional
requirement
of
the
district
of
the
thousand
have
been
filed
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
i
couldn't
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
this
represents
8%
of
all
new
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
is
sort
of
that
where
their
real
purpose
and
they'd
be
unconstitutional
in
a
different
way
than
they
are
being
unconstitutional
right
now.

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
