mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
before
i
start,
the
state
of
connecticut
has
agreed
to
allot
seven
minutes
of
its
time
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa,
mrs.
lorna
williams.
now,
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
is
quite
simple
and
i
don't
think
they
are
particularly
in
dispute.
ms.
thompson,
the
appellee
who
was
receiving
aid
to
dependent
children
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
moved
into
connecticut
and
was
refused
public
assistant
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
residency
requirements
of
17-2d
and
i
think
that
the
only
question
facing
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
state
may
pass
a
reasonable
residency
requirement
in
the
field
of
public
assistance
particularly
aid
to
dependent
children,
a
law
that
is
clearly
not
racially
aimed.
a
law
that
has
no
permanent
effect
on
the
persons
aimed
at.
a
law
that
has
no
criminal
sanctions
and
one
that
involves
the
spending
of
state
tax
raised
funds
and
one
actually
that
encourages
new
migrants
into
the
state
of
connecticut
to
enter
the
labor
market
and
parenthetically,
if
i
notice
in
this
last
part
that
the
congress
in
h.r.
12080
of
the
social
security
amendments
of
1967
has
followed
connecticut's
very
good
lead
in
this
case
and
their
afdc,
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children
by
establishing
a
work
incentive
program
very
similar
to
the
regulations
and
policy
of
the
state
of
connecticut
set
up
and
the
residency
requirement.
i
noticed
it's
called
work
incentive
program
probably
the
nickname
for
that
would
be
wip
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
use
that
connotation
in
front
of
the
court
when
i'm
arguing
this
type
of
case.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
it's
the
--
this
is
h.r.
12080
your
honor
of
the
social
security
amendments
of
1967
and
actually
the
law
was
not
passed
until,
i
believe
december
15th
and
i
noticed
that
came
out
--
was
reported
out
in
apwa
washington
report
volume
2
number
7,
dated
december
22,
1967.
now,
it
was
always
in
my
belief
that
the
fundamental
and
central
historical
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
protect
persons
from
statutes
that
were
first
racially
aimed
and
that
seems
to
be
what
this
court
has
dealt
with
in
the
last
few
years
and
also
cases
involving
acquired
property
rights.
however,
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
has
been
used
to
paraphrase
dr.
samuel
jackson
as
the
last
refuge
of
the
constitutional
bankrupt.
it
has
been
used
when
the
appellees
could
find
no
true
legal
precedent
on
which
to
base
their
decision.
now,
judge's
smith
and
judge
blumenfeld
when
they
wrote
their
majority
opinion
in
the
thompson
case
was
a
vigorous
decent
from
judge
clary
conceded
that
the
purpose
of
section
17-2d
was
to
protect
the
public
purse
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
a
purpose
which
i
always
thought
was
wadable
but
they
didn't
went
on
to
indicate
that
the
state
of
connecticut
had
not
born
the
burden
of
proving
that
this
was
justifiable
purpose
or
that
the
classification
was
reasonable.
now,
since
when
does
a
state
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
their
statute
is
constitutional.
it
was
stated
in
that
darlington
case
every
possible
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
and
this
continues
until
the
contrary
is
shown
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
when
one
looks
at
the
memorandum
not
only
in
the
thompson
case
but
in
the
harold
case
and
the
smith
case,
the
companion
case
that
to
be
argued
here
today,
it
is
plainly
apparent
that
the
judges
based
their
decision,
however,
benevolent
and
well
meaning
that
it
might
be
on
their
own
personal,
social
philosophy
and
then
went
out
and
actually
looked
in
vain
for
any
cases
that
could
support
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
the
problem
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i'm
wondering
if
the
burden
rests
on
the
state
to
justify
any
--
it
seems
to
me
in
any
type
of
civil
matter
that
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
until
the
end.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
they
have
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
in
my
brief,
they
explained
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
think
that
they're
obliged
to
do
it
and
in
this
case,
they
said
--
they
thought
that
the
money
that
was
going
to
be
spent
should
be
spent
on
those
persons
who
first
had
helped
contribute
to
the
state's
economy.
this
certainly
isn't
an
unusual
statute.
it's
a
statute
that's
in
40
states
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
has
long
been
sanctioned
by
congress.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
your
honor.
in
fact
i
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
your
honor,
when
justice
cardozo
had
a
problem
fairly
similarly
in
this
event,
helvering
versus
davis
case,
he
didn't
have
any
problems
to
a
matter
of
common
sense,
talking
about
the
old
age
pensions
being
in
every
single
state.
in
fact,
he
said
that
it
would
seem
that
if
it
wasn't
put
in
every
single
state
--
that
the
states
that
did
put
them
in
would
be
haven
of
repulse
for
those
people
who
desire
to
go
there.
so
i
think
certainly
the
state
should
put
out
with
the
purposes
the
state.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
the
state
of
connecticut
from
this
case
when
they
said
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
in
that
case
that
it
might
well,
except
that
it's
a
question
that
seems
so
remote,
a
loaded
question
redheaded
people.
i
doubt
if
a
case
like
that
could
come
up.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
but
i
would
imagine
in
this
case,
the
court
could
put
a
marginal
--
a
rational
explanation.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
that
either
one
of
the
cases
is
that
--
particularly
where
states
like
connecticut
are
having
considerable
problems
in
the
amount
of
welfare
funds
they
raised.
in
fact
mr.
gladstone,
the
comptroller
of
the
state
of
connecticut
has
indicated
there
probably
be
a
$46
million
deficit
in
the
state
budget
because
connecticut
has
a
very
liberal
program
and
an
opening
budget.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
think
there's
a
big
difference
in
physically
restrained
persons
from
coming
in.
there
you
have
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
ultimate
impact
discourages
has
done
but
there's
still
a
difference
in
your
question.
one,
there's
a
natural
restraint.
the
other,
you're
saying
that
there
should
be
subsidized
travel
and
subsidized
settlement.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
of
course,
if
the
persons
move
in
knowing
that
they're
going
to
get
welfare
and
not
enter
the
labor
market,
it
would
seem
that
you
have
a
problem
then
on
subsidized
settlement
and
not
of
the
restraint
on
the
moving
in.
in
fact,
in
the
edwards
case,
mr.
slaff
pointed
out
what
the
real
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
in
his
brief.
he
said
the
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
it
had
a
tendency
to
threaten
under
the
guise
of
criminal
prosecution.
now,
where
the
17-2d
threatened
anybody?
it
certainly
didn't
threaten
ms.
thompson
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court,
she
was
eligible
for
welfare
and
she
drew
her
check
starting
in
july,
a
few
days
after
the
case
was
decided
and
she's
still
under
oath
so
i
don't
see
where
the
impact
of
17-2d
threatens
anybody.
i
would
imagine
any
--
many
laws
discouraged
people
from
doing
things
but
that
doesn't
mean
per
se
they
are
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
would
--
i
think
we
admitted
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
oh,
i
think
we
admitted
that
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
hide
it.
we
admitted
that
the
statute
was
discriminatory
and
there's
no
question
that
the
impact
of
the
statute
is
to
discourage
people
who
are
coming
to
the
state
where
a
substantial
factor
for
them
coming
to
the
state
is
get
on
the
welfare
rules
and
not
a
substantial
factor
when
coming
to
the
state
to
work
and
in
fact,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
the
facts
say
that
she
came
in
to
live
with
her
mother
but
i'm
wondering
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
it
isn't
and
in
fact
your
honor,
connecticut
does
not
have
residency
requirements
for
old
age
assistance
because
we
figure
that
people
have
lived
--
who
lived
in
the
state
years
ago
who
might
want
to
come
back
to
live
with
their
family
and
probably,
at
one
time
contributed
to
the
connecticut
economy
and
we
don't
have
it
an
aid
to
disable
but
my
argument
there
is
she
may
well
have
come
in
to
see
her
mother
but
a
substantial
factor
and
was
the
fact
that
welfare
--
she
could
get
welfare
and
we
question
whether
she
would
have
come
in
if
welfare
was
not
available.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
and
may
i
point
out
to
your
honor
before
i
get
to
that
question.
the
one
year
is
the
outside
limitation.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
the
only
thing
--
i
think
the
only
problem
in
the
state
of
connecticut
is
a
question
of
economics.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
so
many
dollars
available
and
in
fact
$46
million
projected
deficit
right
now
and
certainly,
one
of
the
results
i
think
of
an
adverse
decision
in
this
case
would
be
to
penalize
the
state
like
connecticut
which
the
right
at
least
is
fourth
in
the
type
of
grants
they
give
now
in
aid
to
dependent
children
and
with
the
new
cost
of
living
commission
may
well
be
first.
and
i
wonder
and
i
don't
think
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
imagination
to
wonder
if
the
connecticut
statute
is
struck
down.
the
other
ones
will
be
--
are
struck
down
whether
there'll
be
a
rush
by
the
states
to
see
who
can
reach
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
welfare
so
there
won't
be
anybody
coming
in
to
the
state.
now
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no.
i
realize
your
honor
that
we
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
anymore
than
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
support
some
of
the
so
called
objective
writers
in
the
field
of
the
poor
that
have
written
extensively
and
i
know
that
it's
quoted
liberally
by
my
brother
in
his
brief
and
which
unfortunate
practice
was
followed
by
the
amicus
briefs
for
the
appellee.
there's
no
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
no
question.
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i
imagine
how
judges
experience
on
hearing
a
case
like
this
has
no
difficulty.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
refer
to
your
honor
as
an
expert
in
the
field,
i
realize
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
and
nobody
questions
the
fact
that
this
is
a
difficult
problem.
i
don't
question
the
fact
that
it's
a
difficult
problem
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
was
going
to
answer
your
honor
this
way.
in
the
same
term
--
41
term
at
the
edward's
case
was
decided,
this
court
denied
certiorari
without
comment
in
the
case
of
sweeney
versus
board
of
public
assistance.
and
that
was
a
case
very
similar
to
this
case
in
which
a
person
and
pennsylvania
claim
that
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
public
assistance
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
denied
them
liberty
to
move
and
live
where
they
please
in
violation
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
and
the
case
went
up
from
the
district
court
without
comment
to
the
circuit
court
and
without
comment
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
judge
in
that
case
said
two
things
that
were
very
pertinent.
one
he
said,
there
is
no
arbitrary
restraint
here
to
the
plaintiffs
right
to
live
where
they
want.
the
restraint
is
imposed
only
if
they
want
to
receive
a
grant
of
public
assistance
from
the
state
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
and
it's
something
that
i
think
your
brother
mr.
justice
black
has
very
recently
said
in
his
carpenter
lectures
at
columbia,
"courts
will
proceed
with
great
caution
before
overthrowing
in
the
work
of
such
board
since
the
investigation
and
study
have
best
enabled
them
to
determine
what
regulations
will
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
and
this
is
the
fundamental
aim
of
democracy."
now,
i
say
certainly,
who
should
know
more
about
the
fiscal
problems
in
the
welfare,
problems
in
the
state
of
connecticut
than
the
elected
legislative
committee
that
recommended
the
statute?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
no
question
--
i
think
it's
just
a
problem
in
every
welfare
fields
your
honor.
i
think
your
honor
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
there's
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no
your
honor
but
i
think
the
residency
has
a
long
history
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
--
in
the
most
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
i
wouldn't
--
i
don't
intend
to
give
an
impression
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
residency
has
historical
phases.
the
question
of
--
and
i
--
if
you
have
to
divide
that
but
i
can't
think
about
any
other
way
that
it
can
be
done.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor
under
the
social
security
laws,
i
don't
think
with
this
federal
government
contribute
in
46%
than
any
of
the
state
would
do
it.
they
wouldn't
do
it
as
a
practical
economic
matter.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
some
states
if
not
connecticut
have
the
five
out
of
nine
year
residency
requirement
already
in
their
age
of
disabled
and
the
old
age
assistance
program.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
your
honor
if
--
superior
beauty
and
brains
i
hope.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i
don't
want
to
re-hash
the
arguments
that
we
went
into
last
spring.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
rather
unfortunate
consequences
if
the
lower
court's
decision
is
upheld.
one
consequence
that
was
not
raised
last
spring
would
be
the
very
harsh
impact
on
the
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
by
42
u.s.c.
603(d).
now
this
1967
social
security
amendment,
it's
the
so
called
“freeze
section”,
will
limit
federal
matching
funds
to
--
that
go
to
the
states
to
the
percentage
of
children
under
age
18
that
are
on
afdc
to
the
total
under
age
18
population
in
the
state.
in
other
words,
as
of
january
1,
1968,
if
the
afdc
population
under
age
18
increases
more
rapidly
than
the
under
age
18
population
as
a
whole,
this
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
will
not
get
one
nickel
more
of
federal
matching
funds
to
offset
this
increased
burden.
so
when
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
states
like
connecticut
that
give
decent
welfare
benefits
get
only
46%
matching
funds
as
against
the
poor
welfare
benefits
states
that
get
5-6
or
83%,
i
think
you'll
agree
this
is
a
rather
harsh
impact
indeed
and
it
follows
an
article
in
the
new
york
times
of
october
14,
1968.
on
page
28,
where
there
was
a
recent
study
by
the
citizens
budget
commission
on
what
this
influx
was
doing
to
the
liberal
welfare
benefits
states.
for
example,
in
the
last
eight
years
from
1959
to
the
beginning
of
1967,
connecticut's
afdc
caseload
has
increased
147%,
new
jersey's
287%.
the
10
most
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
have
found
their
afdc
caseloads
and
costs
skyrocketing
while
the
10
least
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
in
many
cases
have
actually
found
their
welfare
cases
decreasing.
this
study
further
pointed
out
a,
i
think,
a
very
fundamental
thing
that
said
a
low
persons
don't
necessarily
migrate
into
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
solely
to
get
on
the
afdc
roles.
it
was
a
prime
consideration
in
their
move
and
to
quote
a
humane
system
of
local
welfare
and
a
reasonably
adequate
amount
of
welfare
payments
was
an
important
consideration
in
the
movement
of
persons
to
the
liberal
benefit
states
and
i
think
this
observation
coincides
with
the
very
common
sense
observation
that
mr.
justice
cardozo
made
back
in
the
early
‘30s
in
the
helvering
case
where
he
said,
a
system
of
old
age
pensions
has
special
dangers
of
its
own
if
put
enforce
in
one
state
and
rejected
in
another.
the
existence
of
such
a
system
is
a
bait
for
the
needy
and
the
dependent
elsewhere
encouraging
them
to
migrate
and
seek
a
haven
of
repose
and
i
think
any
adverse
decision
by
this
court
would
have
the
effect
of
penalizing
every
liberal
welfare
benefit
state
by
putting
a
premium
on
the
poor
benefit
state
to
encourage
their
needy
and
dependent
to
migrate
to
greener
pastures.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
they
--
if
they
--
they
might
be
able
to
do
that
and
say
we're
going
to
put
a
--
have
a
limited
amount
of
money
and
this
is
the
budget,
so
that
you
won't
get
anymore.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
--
i
think
that
it's
--
when
it
involves
mainly
state
raise
funds
it
is.
it
should
be
these
--
these
are
state
programs
with
some
federal
matching
funds.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
pardon?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
the
big
problem
there
--
one
of
the
problems
weighed
--
i
believe
that
the
--
this
section
17-2d
should
be
found
constitutional.
mr.
justice
fortas,
it's
because
for
the
court
to
say
that
a
--
a
state
can't
do
that
is
an
invasion,
i
think
it
note
in
a
very
fundamental
legislative
function
as
the
raising
of
their
own
state
tax
funds
and
a
spending
of
them.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
--
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
written
for
that,
your
honor.
i
think
in
its
historical
context
and
this
court
has
recently
agreed
and
mclaughlin
versus
florida
case
that
the
historical
context
was
--
was
to
say
that
a
person
shouldn't
be
discriminated
on
a
basis
of
race.
so
if
a
state
had
a
very
poor
benefit
program
and
they
said
we're
only
going
to
appropriate
a
certain
amount
of
money
but
it
didn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
really
shouldn't
apply.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
pardon?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
think
it's
a
--
there's
a
little
difference,
your
honor,
between
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
what
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
was
considered
off
--
a
right
before
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
it
didn't
need
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
has
been
discussed
in
--
in
several
cases
including
the
edwards
case
but
i
don't
think
it
applies
here.
a
right
to
travel
across
a
state
line,
there's
a
little
difference
between
subsidized
settlement
and
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
edwards
case,
i
don't
think
the
edwards
case
applies
here
at
all.
in
the
edwards
case,
mr.
slaff
who
was
edwards
counsel
said
the
real
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
it
intimidated
on
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
and
certainly,
if
you
threatened
to
prosecute
a
person
who
was
coming
across
a
state
line,
it's
a
considerable
difference
in
the
--
if
you
say
--
if
you
come
across
a
state
line
as
the
connecticut
statute
says
and
you're
not
willing
to
work
or
at
least
train
for
work
or
have
assets
to
support
yourself
for
three
months,
you
may
have
to
wait
a
year
before
you
get
welfare.
i
--
there's
--
i
--
i
think
there's
a
considerable
difference
in
that
type
of
case
and
--
and
in
fact
in
the
edwards'
case,
mr.
tolan
for
the
select
committee
said
that
the
law
shouldn't
apply
in
that
case
to
person's
who
have
worked,
who
are
willing
to
work,
and
who
are
able
to
work
in
every
respect
except
they
are
temporarily
without
work
and
i
don't
think
the
facts
there
fit
ms.
thompson.
nobody
advocated
that
mr.
duncan
at
the
end
of
depression
should
come
into
california,
avoid
the
labor
market
and
get
a
welfare
check.
in
fact
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
byrnes
was
specific
on
that
question.
he
said
the
ability
or
right
of
the
--
the
california
to
support
--
their
obligation
to
support
was
not
involved.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
don't
assure,
your
honor.
all
i
know
was
that
the
--
that
their
welfare
rules
about
eight
years
have
gone
up
147%.
i
know
that
they
--
they
have
an
open-ended
budget
and
i
would
say
it
was
probably
for
the
size
of
the
state
one
of
the
most
liberal
in
united
states
and
last
spring
when
i
was
down
here,
they
had
a
$40
million
deficit
mainly
because
of
afdc
and
now
they
have
$73
million
deficit
in
welfare
early
this
fall.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
this
--
new
york
times
study
shows
that
it's
considerable.
it's
more
than
10%
of
the
population
have
--
have
shifted
into
the
liberal
--
the
10
most
liberal
welfare
benefit
states.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
it's
a
--
it
was
a
citizens
budget
commission
study
that
was
in
the
new
york
times
of
october
14,
1968
on
page
28,
your
honor,
and
i
--
i
gave
the
clerk's
office
nine
copies
so
the
court
could
use
it
--
be
available
to
them,
your
honor.
one
of
the
questions
that
bothered
the
court
the
last
time
i
was
here
was
the
--
what
reasons,
good
reasons,
can
connecticut
give
that
their
statue
17-2d
should
be
found
constitutional.
well,
the
first
basis
i
think
is
there
was
no
confident
evidence
produced
by
the
appellee
in
this
case
who
bore
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
connecticut
legislature
arrived
at
their
decision
wholly
by
caprice
and
without
any
reasonable
basis.
secondly,
the
connecticut
legislature,
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
were
concerned
with
the
rising
welfare
costs
could
not
give
decent
benefits
to
everyone.
they
had
their
choice
that
could
give
to
maintain
their
same
high
standard
with
some
cut
off
or
they
could
lower
their
standard
like
the
other
states
and
i
think
they
wisely
chose
to
follow
the
former.
i
think
thirdly
that
the
connecticut
statute
itself
--
self
has
a
very
laudable
and
salutary
purpose
of
encouraging
people
to
enter
the
labor
market.
the
connecticut
statute
is
unique
and
different
from
the
other
40
states
in
this.connecticut
says
if
you
come
in
the
--
the
connecticut
and
you
have
a
bona
fide
job
offer,
if
you're
willing
to
work
or
if
you're
willing
to
train
for
work
and
it
takes
a
whole
year
to
train,
if
something
happens
to
you
during
that
time,
connecticut
will
give
you
a
high
standard.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
our
deficit?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
can't
say
in
a
one
year,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
--
i'll
--
i'll
tell
you
your
honor
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
it's
on
60.
number
60
of
--
of
the
--
stipulation
of
facts
is
on
page
45a.
we
show
the
yearly
average
per
person
caseload
on
afdc
from
1960
to
1966
showing
how
it
went
up.
it
went
up
fantastically
every
year
until
it
passed
the
1965
statute
then
it
became
effective.
that
was
a
first
year
they
had
a
drop.
now
--
when
the
thompson
case
was
decided,
i
--
i
don't
have
any
statistics
except
general
knowledge
that
welfare
caseload
and
it
goes
to
town
using
people
coming
to
connecticut,
they
go
to
the
town
first
for
welfare,
that
the
towns
have
found
a
--
a
large
increase
again
of
people
come
out
on
welfare
rolls.
which
you
can
all
look
at
the
whole
picture
and
it's
no
question
that
the
connecticut
welfare
roll
is
next
to
new
jersey,
i
think,
that
new
york
have
increased
more
rapidly
than
any
state
in
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
--
i
think
your
honor
will
find
that
the
congress
and
not
adf
--
afdc
but
in
the
aid
to
disable
then
aid
to
the
--
an
old
age,
i
think
allow
a
five
out
of
nine
years.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
can't
speak
for
what
the
legislature
did,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
one
reason
they
didn't
raise
it
from
one
to
five
is
because
they
wouldn't
get
any
federal
grants
under
the
social
security
laws
which
could've
--
would
set
it
to
the
maximum
of
one
year,
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
practical
reason.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
practical
matter
and
in
ms.
thompson's
case,
she
was
able
to
get
by
and
there
was
no
proof
solicited
during
--
either
run
the
stipulation
of
facts
or
any
evidence
that
she
suffered
and
then
she's
still
on
the
--
she's
now
on
the
welfare
roll
to
get
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
so
i
--
so
that
--
and
--
and
no
evidence
presented
any
person
that
ever
came
in
connecticut
and
starved
because
of
the
one
year
residency
statute,
so
it
would
be
your
sheer
speculation
on
the
court
that
person
would
starve.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
money
and
i
think
that
--
and
as
i
said,
i
think
that
it
has
a
salutary
purpose.it
encourages
people
to
enter
the
labor
market.
in
fact,
congress
in
42
u.s.c.
607
in
the
work
incentive
program
is
also
attempting
to
encourage
people
again
by
offering
them
a
better
deal.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
think
if
he
came
to
connecticut
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
if
he
came
to
connecticut,
he
wouldn't
have
to
look
22
hours
a
day
for
a
job.
there's
plenty
of
them
there.
first,
and
secondly,
it
couldn't
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would've
imagined
that
any
state
with
a
--
with
--
where
there's
plenty
of
jobs
available,
a
person
wouldn't
have
to
work.
but
in
connecticut,
if
you
couldn't
find
a
job
they'd
train
them
and
give
them
welfare.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
he
has
60
days
in
which
he
can
look
for
a
job.
if
you
can't
find
a
job
within
the
60
days
and
he
goes
down
to
this
--
down
to
the
welfare
office
and
said,
“i
can't
find
a
job
because
i'm
not
qualified.”
they'll
--
they
have
--
there's
title
5,
that's
the
government
finance
and
their
state
programs,
where
they'll
say,
“good,
we'll
train
you.”
and
if
the
training
program
took
nearly
a
year,
they'd
still
support
him
all
during
that
time.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
--
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
we
got
people
in
--
working
for
the
state
of
connecticut
themselves
that
come
in
a
wheelchair
everyday.
in
fact,
there's
enough
jobs
around
in
the
state
training
schools
for
the
retarded
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
very,
very,
very
small
amount,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
again
to
the
edwards
case
which
i
noticed
that
was
raised
by
all
the
judges
and
of
lower
courts
and
in
all
the
briefs.
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
i
think
that
edwards
should
not
apply
here.
first,
it's
our
contention
if
duncan
came
into
connecticut
under
the
same
circumstances
he
came
to
california.
at
the
end
of
depression,
he'd
be
immediately
eligible
for
welfare.
but
the
second
case,
i
think
is
sweeney
versus
the
board
of
public
assistance
that
was
decided
by
the
same
court
in
the
same
term
as
edwards.
and
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
defendant
board
denied
her
the
right
to
live
where
she
pleased
and
it
was
a
clear
restrain
on
her
liberty
of
movement
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
i
think
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised,
same
claim
is
in
the
thompson
case.
the
district
court
in
that
case
which
was
upheld
on
appeal
stated,
“there
is
no
arbitrary
restraint
on
the
plaintiff's
right
to
live
where
they
please.”
and
this
court
when
out
to
say
something,
i
think
is
fundamental
in
this
case.
it
said,
“courts
will
proceed
with
great
caution
before
overthrowing
the
work
of
such
boards.
since
their
investigation
and
study
have
best
enabled
them
to
determine
what
regulations
will
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number,”
and
that
is
the
fundamental
aim
of
this
democracy.
now,
who
should
know
more
about
connecticut's
welfare
problems
than
the
duly
elected
legislative
subcommittee
that
recommended
17-2d
to
the
legislature
are
a
two-man
majority
of
the
three
judge
federal
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
yield
seven
minutes
of
my
time
to
argue
on
--
amicus
argument
and
the
remainder
of
the
time
to
mr.
sennett
from
pennsylvania
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
before
i
start,
the
state
of
connecticut
has
agreed
to
allot
seven
minutes
of
its
time
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa,
mrs.
lorna
williams.
now,
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
is
quite
simple
and
i
don't
think
they
are
particularly
in
dispute.
ms.
thompson,
the
appellee
who
was
receiving
aid
to
dependent
children
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
moved
into
connecticut
and
was
refused
public
assistant
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
residency
requirements
of
17-2d
and
i
think
that
the
only
question
facing
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
state
may
pass
a
reasonable
residency
requirement
in
the
field
of
public
assistance
particularly
aid
to
dependent
children,
a
law
that
is
clearly
not
racially
aimed.
a
law
that
has
no
permanent
effect
on
the
persons
aimed
at.
a
law
that
has
no
criminal
sanctions
and
one
that
involves
the
spending
of
state
tax
raised
funds
and
one
actually
that
encourages
new
migrants
into
the
state
of
connecticut
to
enter
the
labor
market
and
parenthetically,
if
i
notice
in
this
last
part
that
the
congress
in
h.r.
12080
of
the
social
security
amendments
of
1967
has
followed
connecticut's
very
good
lead
in
this
case
and
their
afdc,
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children
by
establishing
a
work
incentive
program
very
similar
to
the
regulations
and
policy
of
the
state
of
connecticut
set
up
and
the
residency
requirement.
i
noticed
it's
called
work
incentive
program
probably
the
nickname
for
that
would
be
wip
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
use
that
connotation
in
front
of
the
court
when
i'm
arguing
this
type
of
case.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
it's
the
--
this
is
h.r.
12080
your
honor
of
the
social
security
amendments
of
1967
and
actually
the
law
was
not
passed
until,
i
believe
december
15th
and
i
noticed
that
came
out
--
was
reported
out
in
apwa
washington
report
volume
2
number
7,
dated
december
22,
1967.
now,
it
was
always
in
my
belief
that
the
fundamental
and
central
historical
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
protect
persons
from
statutes
that
were
first
racially
aimed
and
that
seems
to
be
what
this
court
has
dealt
with
in
the
last
few
years
and
also
cases
involving
acquired
property
rights.
however,
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
has
been
used
to
paraphrase
dr.
samuel
jackson
as
the
last
refuge
of
the
constitutional
bankrupt.
it
has
been
used
when
the
appellees
could
find
no
true
legal
precedent
on
which
to
base
their
decision.
now,
judge's
smith
and
judge
blumenfeld
when
they
wrote
their
majority
opinion
in
the
thompson
case
was
a
vigorous
decent
from
judge
clary
conceded
that
the
purpose
of
section
17-2d
was
to
protect
the
public
purse
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
a
purpose
which
i
always
thought
was
wadable
but
they
didn't
went
on
to
indicate
that
the
state
of
connecticut
had
not
born
the
burden
of
proving
that
this
was
justifiable
purpose
or
that
the
classification
was
reasonable.
now,
since
when
does
a
state
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
their
statute
is
constitutional.
it
was
stated
in
that
darlington
case
every
possible
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
and
this
continues
until
the
contrary
is
shown
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
when
one
looks
at
the
memorandum
not
only
in
the
thompson
case
but
in
the
harold
case
and
the
smith
case,
the
companion
case
that
to
be
argued
here
today,
it
is
plainly
apparent
that
the
judges
based
their
decision,
however,
benevolent
and
well
meaning
that
it
might
be
on
their
own
personal,
social
philosophy
and
then
went
out
and
actually
looked
in
vain
for
any
cases
that
could
support
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
the
problem
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i'm
wondering
if
the
burden
rests
on
the
state
to
justify
any
--
it
seems
to
me
in
any
type
of
civil
matter
that
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
until
the
end.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
they
have
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
in
my
brief,
they
explained
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
think
that
they're
obliged
to
do
it
and
in
this
case,
they
said
--
they
thought
that
the
money
that
was
going
to
be
spent
should
be
spent
on
those
persons
who
first
had
helped
contribute
to
the
state's
economy.
this
certainly
isn't
an
unusual
statute.
it's
a
statute
that's
in
40
states
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
has
long
been
sanctioned
by
congress.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
your
honor.
in
fact
i
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
your
honor,
when
justice
cardozo
had
a
problem
fairly
similarly
in
this
event,
helvering
versus
davis
case,
he
didn't
have
any
problems
to
a
matter
of
common
sense,
talking
about
the
old
age
pensions
being
in
every
single
state.
in
fact,
he
said
that
it
would
seem
that
if
it
wasn't
put
in
every
single
state
--
that
the
states
that
did
put
them
in
would
be
haven
of
repulse
for
those
people
who
desire
to
go
there.
so
i
think
certainly
the
state
should
put
out
with
the
purposes
the
state.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
the
state
of
connecticut
from
this
case
when
they
said
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
in
that
case
that
it
might
well,
except
that
it's
a
question
that
seems
so
remote,
a
loaded
question
redheaded
people.
i
doubt
if
a
case
like
that
could
come
up.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
but
i
would
imagine
in
this
case,
the
court
could
put
a
marginal
--
a
rational
explanation.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
that
either
one
of
the
cases
is
that
--
particularly
where
states
like
connecticut
are
having
considerable
problems
in
the
amount
of
welfare
funds
they
raised.
in
fact
mr.
gladstone,
the
comptroller
of
the
state
of
connecticut
has
indicated
there
probably
be
a
$46
million
deficit
in
the
state
budget
because
connecticut
has
a
very
liberal
program
and
an
opening
budget.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
think
there's
a
big
difference
in
physically
restrained
persons
from
coming
in.
there
you
have
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
ultimate
impact
discourages
has
done
but
there's
still
a
difference
in
your
question.
one,
there's
a
natural
restraint.
the
other,
you're
saying
that
there
should
be
subsidized
travel
and
subsidized
settlement.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
of
course,
if
the
persons
move
in
knowing
that
they're
going
to
get
welfare
and
not
enter
the
labor
market,
it
would
seem
that
you
have
a
problem
then
on
subsidized
settlement
and
not
of
the
restraint
on
the
moving
in.
in
fact,
in
the
edwards
case,
mr.
slaff
pointed
out
what
the
real
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
in
his
brief.
he
said
the
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
it
had
a
tendency
to
threaten
under
the
guise
of
criminal
prosecution.
now,
where
the
17-2d
threatened
anybody?
it
certainly
didn't
threaten
ms.
thompson
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court,
she
was
eligible
for
welfare
and
she
drew
her
check
starting
in
july,
a
few
days
after
the
case
was
decided
and
she's
still
under
oath
so
i
don't
see
where
the
impact
of
17-2d
threatens
anybody.
i
would
imagine
any
--
many
laws
discouraged
people
from
doing
things
but
that
doesn't
mean
per
se
they
are
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
would
--
i
think
we
admitted
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
oh,
i
think
we
admitted
that
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
hide
it.
we
admitted
that
the
statute
was
discriminatory
and
there's
no
question
that
the
impact
of
the
statute
is
to
discourage
people
who
are
coming
to
the
state
where
a
substantial
factor
for
them
coming
to
the
state
is
get
on
the
welfare
rules
and
not
a
substantial
factor
when
coming
to
the
state
to
work
and
in
fact,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
the
facts
say
that
she
came
in
to
live
with
her
mother
but
i'm
wondering
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
it
isn't
and
in
fact
your
honor,
connecticut
does
not
have
residency
requirements
for
old
age
assistance
because
we
figure
that
people
have
lived
--
who
lived
in
the
state
years
ago
who
might
want
to
come
back
to
live
with
their
family
and
probably,
at
one
time
contributed
to
the
connecticut
economy
and
we
don't
have
it
an
aid
to
disable
but
my
argument
there
is
she
may
well
have
come
in
to
see
her
mother
but
a
substantial
factor
and
was
the
fact
that
welfare
--
she
could
get
welfare
and
we
question
whether
she
would
have
come
in
if
welfare
was
not
available.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
and
may
i
point
out
to
your
honor
before
i
get
to
that
question.
the
one
year
is
the
outside
limitation.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
the
only
thing
--
i
think
the
only
problem
in
the
state
of
connecticut
is
a
question
of
economics.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
so
many
dollars
available
and
in
fact
$46
million
projected
deficit
right
now
and
certainly,
one
of
the
results
i
think
of
an
adverse
decision
in
this
case
would
be
to
penalize
the
state
like
connecticut
which
the
right
at
least
is
fourth
in
the
type
of
grants
they
give
now
in
aid
to
dependent
children
and
with
the
new
cost
of
living
commission
may
well
be
first.
and
i
wonder
and
i
don't
think
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
imagination
to
wonder
if
the
connecticut
statute
is
struck
down.
the
other
ones
will
be
--
are
struck
down
whether
there'll
be
a
rush
by
the
states
to
see
who
can
reach
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
welfare
so
there
won't
be
anybody
coming
in
to
the
state.
now
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no.
i
realize
your
honor
that
we
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
anymore
than
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
support
some
of
the
so
called
objective
writers
in
the
field
of
the
poor
that
have
written
extensively
and
i
know
that
it's
quoted
liberally
by
my
brother
in
his
brief
and
which
unfortunate
practice
was
followed
by
the
amicus
briefs
for
the
appellee.
there's
no
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
no
question.
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i
imagine
how
judges
experience
on
hearing
a
case
like
this
has
no
difficulty.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
refer
to
your
honor
as
an
expert
in
the
field,
i
realize
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
and
nobody
questions
the
fact
that
this
is
a
difficult
problem.
i
don't
question
the
fact
that
it's
a
difficult
problem
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
was
going
to
answer
your
honor
this
way.
in
the
same
term
--
41
term
at
the
edward's
case
was
decided,
this
court
denied
certiorari
without
comment
in
the
case
of
sweeney
versus
board
of
public
assistance.
and
that
was
a
case
very
similar
to
this
case
in
which
a
person
and
pennsylvania
claim
that
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
public
assistance
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
denied
them
liberty
to
move
and
live
where
they
please
in
violation
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
and
the
case
went
up
from
the
district
court
without
comment
to
the
circuit
court
and
without
comment
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
judge
in
that
case
said
two
things
that
were
very
pertinent.
one
he
said,
there
is
no
arbitrary
restraint
here
to
the
plaintiffs
right
to
live
where
they
want.
the
restraint
is
imposed
only
if
they
want
to
receive
a
grant
of
public
assistance
from
the
state
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
and
it's
something
that
i
think
your
brother
mr.
justice
black
has
very
recently
said
in
his
carpenter
lectures
at
columbia,
"courts
will
proceed
with
great
caution
before
overthrowing
in
the
work
of
such
board
since
the
investigation
and
study
have
best
enabled
them
to
determine
what
regulations
will
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
and
this
is
the
fundamental
aim
of
democracy."
now,
i
say
certainly,
who
should
know
more
about
the
fiscal
problems
in
the
welfare,
problems
in
the
state
of
connecticut
than
the
elected
legislative
committee
that
recommended
the
statute?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
there's
no
question
--
i
think
it's
just
a
problem
in
every
welfare
fields
your
honor.
i
think
your
honor
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
there's
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no
your
honor
but
i
think
the
residency
has
a
long
history
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
--
in
the
most
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
no,
i
wouldn't
--
i
don't
intend
to
give
an
impression
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
residency
has
historical
phases.
the
question
of
--
and
i
--
if
you
have
to
divide
that
but
i
can't
think
about
any
other
way
that
it
can
be
done.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor
under
the
social
security
laws,
i
don't
think
with
this
federal
government
contribute
in
46%
than
any
of
the
state
would
do
it.
they
wouldn't
do
it
as
a
practical
economic
matter.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
some
states
if
not
connecticut
have
the
five
out
of
nine
year
residency
requirement
already
in
their
age
of
disabled
and
the
old
age
assistance
program.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
your
honor
if
--
superior
beauty
and
brains
i
hope.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i
don't
want
to
re-hash
the
arguments
that
we
went
into
last
spring.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
rather
unfortunate
consequences
if
the
lower
court's
decision
is
upheld.
one
consequence
that
was
not
raised
last
spring
would
be
the
very
harsh
impact
on
the
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
by
42
u.s.c.
603(d).
now
this
1967
social
security
amendment,
it's
the
so
called
“freeze
section”,
will
limit
federal
matching
funds
to
--
that
go
to
the
states
to
the
percentage
of
children
under
age
18
that
are
on
afdc
to
the
total
under
age
18
population
in
the
state.
in
other
words,
as
of
january
1,
1968,
if
the
afdc
population
under
age
18
increases
more
rapidly
than
the
under
age
18
population
as
a
whole,
this
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
will
not
get
one
nickel
more
of
federal
matching
funds
to
offset
this
increased
burden.
so
when
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
states
like
connecticut
that
give
decent
welfare
benefits
get
only
46%
matching
funds
as
against
the
poor
welfare
benefits
states
that
get
5-6
or
83%,
i
think
you'll
agree
this
is
a
rather
harsh
impact
indeed
and
it
follows
an
article
in
the
new
york
times
of
october
14,
1968.
on
page
28,
where
there
was
a
recent
study
by
the
citizens
budget
commission
on
what
this
influx
was
doing
to
the
liberal
welfare
benefits
states.
for
example,
in
the
last
eight
years
from
1959
to
the
beginning
of
1967,
connecticut's
afdc
caseload
has
increased
147%,
new
jersey's
287%.
the
10
most
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
have
found
their
afdc
caseloads
and
costs
skyrocketing
while
the
10
least
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
in
many
cases
have
actually
found
their
welfare
cases
decreasing.
this
study
further
pointed
out
a,
i
think,
a
very
fundamental
thing
that
said
a
low
persons
don't
necessarily
migrate
into
liberal
welfare
benefit
states
solely
to
get
on
the
afdc
roles.
it
was
a
prime
consideration
in
their
move
and
to
quote
a
humane
system
of
local
welfare
and
a
reasonably
adequate
amount
of
welfare
payments
was
an
important
consideration
in
the
movement
of
persons
to
the
liberal
benefit
states
and
i
think
this
observation
coincides
with
the
very
common
sense
observation
that
mr.
justice
cardozo
made
back
in
the
early
‘30s
in
the
helvering
case
where
he
said,
a
system
of
old
age
pensions
has
special
dangers
of
its
own
if
put
enforce
in
one
state
and
rejected
in
another.
the
existence
of
such
a
system
is
a
bait
for
the
needy
and
the
dependent
elsewhere
encouraging
them
to
migrate
and
seek
a
haven
of
repose
and
i
think
any
adverse
decision
by
this
court
would
have
the
effect
of
penalizing
every
liberal
welfare
benefit
state
by
putting
a
premium
on
the
poor
benefit
state
to
encourage
their
needy
and
dependent
to
migrate
to
greener
pastures.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
they
--
if
they
--
they
might
be
able
to
do
that
and
say
we're
going
to
put
a
--
have
a
limited
amount
of
money
and
this
is
the
budget,
so
that
you
won't
get
anymore.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
--
i
think
that
it's
--
when
it
involves
mainly
state
raise
funds
it
is.
it
should
be
these
--
these
are
state
programs
with
some
federal
matching
funds.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
pardon?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
the
big
problem
there
--
one
of
the
problems
weighed
--
i
believe
that
the
--
this
section
17-2d
should
be
found
constitutional.
mr.
justice
fortas,
it's
because
for
the
court
to
say
that
a
--
a
state
can't
do
that
is
an
invasion,
i
think
it
note
in
a
very
fundamental
legislative
function
as
the
raising
of
their
own
state
tax
funds
and
a
spending
of
them.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
--
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
written
for
that,
your
honor.
i
think
in
its
historical
context
and
this
court
has
recently
agreed
and
mclaughlin
versus
florida
case
that
the
historical
context
was
--
was
to
say
that
a
person
shouldn't
be
discriminated
on
a
basis
of
race.
so
if
a
state
had
a
very
poor
benefit
program
and
they
said
we're
only
going
to
appropriate
a
certain
amount
of
money
but
it
didn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
really
shouldn't
apply.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
pardon?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
think
it's
a
--
there's
a
little
difference,
your
honor,
between
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
what
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
was
considered
off
--
a
right
before
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
it
didn't
need
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
that.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
has
been
discussed
in
--
in
several
cases
including
the
edwards
case
but
i
don't
think
it
applies
here.
a
right
to
travel
across
a
state
line,
there's
a
little
difference
between
subsidized
settlement
and
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
edwards
case,
i
don't
think
the
edwards
case
applies
here
at
all.
in
the
edwards
case,
mr.
slaff
who
was
edwards
counsel
said
the
real
evil
of
the
california
statute
was
it
intimidated
on
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
and
certainly,
if
you
threatened
to
prosecute
a
person
who
was
coming
across
a
state
line,
it's
a
considerable
difference
in
the
--
if
you
say
--
if
you
come
across
a
state
line
as
the
connecticut
statute
says
and
you're
not
willing
to
work
or
at
least
train
for
work
or
have
assets
to
support
yourself
for
three
months,
you
may
have
to
wait
a
year
before
you
get
welfare.
i
--
there's
--
i
--
i
think
there's
a
considerable
difference
in
that
type
of
case
and
--
and
in
fact
in
the
edwards'
case,
mr.
tolan
for
the
select
committee
said
that
the
law
shouldn't
apply
in
that
case
to
person's
who
have
worked,
who
are
willing
to
work,
and
who
are
able
to
work
in
every
respect
except
they
are
temporarily
without
work
and
i
don't
think
the
facts
there
fit
ms.
thompson.
nobody
advocated
that
mr.
duncan
at
the
end
of
depression
should
come
into
california,
avoid
the
labor
market
and
get
a
welfare
check.
in
fact
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
byrnes
was
specific
on
that
question.
he
said
the
ability
or
right
of
the
--
the
california
to
support
--
their
obligation
to
support
was
not
involved.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
don't
assure,
your
honor.
all
i
know
was
that
the
--
that
their
welfare
rules
about
eight
years
have
gone
up
147%.
i
know
that
they
--
they
have
an
open-ended
budget
and
i
would
say
it
was
probably
for
the
size
of
the
state
one
of
the
most
liberal
in
united
states
and
last
spring
when
i
was
down
here,
they
had
a
$40
million
deficit
mainly
because
of
afdc
and
now
they
have
$73
million
deficit
in
welfare
early
this
fall.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
this
--
new
york
times
study
shows
that
it's
considerable.
it's
more
than
10%
of
the
population
have
--
have
shifted
into
the
liberal
--
the
10
most
liberal
welfare
benefit
states.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
it's
a
--
it
was
a
citizens
budget
commission
study
that
was
in
the
new
york
times
of
october
14,
1968
on
page
28,
your
honor,
and
i
--
i
gave
the
clerk's
office
nine
copies
so
the
court
could
use
it
--
be
available
to
them,
your
honor.
one
of
the
questions
that
bothered
the
court
the
last
time
i
was
here
was
the
--
what
reasons,
good
reasons,
can
connecticut
give
that
their
statue
17-2d
should
be
found
constitutional.
well,
the
first
basis
i
think
is
there
was
no
confident
evidence
produced
by
the
appellee
in
this
case
who
bore
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
connecticut
legislature
arrived
at
their
decision
wholly
by
caprice
and
without
any
reasonable
basis.
secondly,
the
connecticut
legislature,
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
were
concerned
with
the
rising
welfare
costs
could
not
give
decent
benefits
to
everyone.
they
had
their
choice
that
could
give
to
maintain
their
same
high
standard
with
some
cut
off
or
they
could
lower
their
standard
like
the
other
states
and
i
think
they
wisely
chose
to
follow
the
former.
i
think
thirdly
that
the
connecticut
statute
itself
--
self
has
a
very
laudable
and
salutary
purpose
of
encouraging
people
to
enter
the
labor
market.
the
connecticut
statute
is
unique
and
different
from
the
other
40
states
in
this.connecticut
says
if
you
come
in
the
--
the
connecticut
and
you
have
a
bona
fide
job
offer,
if
you're
willing
to
work
or
if
you're
willing
to
train
for
work
and
it
takes
a
whole
year
to
train,
if
something
happens
to
you
during
that
time,
connecticut
will
give
you
a
high
standard.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
our
deficit?
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
can't
say
in
a
one
year,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well
i
--
i'll
--
i'll
tell
you
your
honor
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
it's
on
60.
number
60
of
--
of
the
--
stipulation
of
facts
is
on
page
45a.
we
show
the
yearly
average
per
person
caseload
on
afdc
from
1960
to
1966
showing
how
it
went
up.
it
went
up
fantastically
every
year
until
it
passed
the
1965
statute
then
it
became
effective.
that
was
a
first
year
they
had
a
drop.
now
--
when
the
thompson
case
was
decided,
i
--
i
don't
have
any
statistics
except
general
knowledge
that
welfare
caseload
and
it
goes
to
town
using
people
coming
to
connecticut,
they
go
to
the
town
first
for
welfare,
that
the
towns
have
found
a
--
a
large
increase
again
of
people
come
out
on
welfare
rolls.
which
you
can
all
look
at
the
whole
picture
and
it's
no
question
that
the
connecticut
welfare
roll
is
next
to
new
jersey,
i
think,
that
new
york
have
increased
more
rapidly
than
any
state
in
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
it
--
i
think
your
honor
will
find
that
the
congress
and
not
adf
--
afdc
but
in
the
aid
to
disable
then
aid
to
the
--
an
old
age,
i
think
allow
a
five
out
of
nine
years.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
can't
speak
for
what
the
legislature
did,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
one
reason
they
didn't
raise
it
from
one
to
five
is
because
they
wouldn't
get
any
federal
grants
under
the
social
security
laws
which
could've
--
would
set
it
to
the
maximum
of
one
year,
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
practical
reason.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
practical
matter
and
in
ms.
thompson's
case,
she
was
able
to
get
by
and
there
was
no
proof
solicited
during
--
either
run
the
stipulation
of
facts
or
any
evidence
that
she
suffered
and
then
she's
still
on
the
--
she's
now
on
the
welfare
roll
to
get
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
so
i
--
so
that
--
and
--
and
no
evidence
presented
any
person
that
ever
came
in
connecticut
and
starved
because
of
the
one
year
residency
statute,
so
it
would
be
your
sheer
speculation
on
the
court
that
person
would
starve.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
money
and
i
think
that
--
and
as
i
said,
i
think
that
it
has
a
salutary
purpose.it
encourages
people
to
enter
the
labor
market.
in
fact,
congress
in
42
u.s.c.
607
in
the
work
incentive
program
is
also
attempting
to
encourage
people
again
by
offering
them
a
better
deal.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
--
i
think
if
he
came
to
connecticut
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
if
he
came
to
connecticut,
he
wouldn't
have
to
look
22
hours
a
day
for
a
job.
there's
plenty
of
them
there.
first,
and
secondly,
it
couldn't
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
well,
i
would've
imagined
that
any
state
with
a
--
with
--
where
there's
plenty
of
jobs
available,
a
person
wouldn't
have
to
work.
but
in
connecticut,
if
you
couldn't
find
a
job
they'd
train
them
and
give
them
welfare.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
he
has
60
days
in
which
he
can
look
for
a
job.
if
you
can't
find
a
job
within
the
60
days
and
he
goes
down
to
this
--
down
to
the
welfare
office
and
said,
“i
can't
find
a
job
because
i'm
not
qualified.”
they'll
--
they
have
--
there's
title
5,
that's
the
government
finance
and
their
state
programs,
where
they'll
say,
“good,
we'll
train
you.”
and
if
the
training
program
took
nearly
a
year,
they'd
still
support
him
all
during
that
time.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
i
--
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
we
got
people
in
--
working
for
the
state
of
connecticut
themselves
that
come
in
a
wheelchair
everyday.
in
fact,
there's
enough
jobs
around
in
the
state
training
schools
for
the
retarded
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
macgregor
very,
very,
very
small
amount,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
again
to
the
edwards
case
which
i
noticed
that
was
raised
by
all
the
judges
and
of
lower
courts
and
in
all
the
briefs.
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
i
think
that
edwards
should
not
apply
here.
first,
it's
our
contention
if
duncan
came
into
connecticut
under
the
same
circumstances
he
came
to
california.
at
the
end
of
depression,
he'd
be
immediately
eligible
for
welfare.
but
the
second
case,
i
think
is
sweeney
versus
the
board
of
public
assistance
that
was
decided
by
the
same
court
in
the
same
term
as
edwards.
and
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
defendant
board
denied
her
the
right
to
live
where
she
pleased
and
it
was
a
clear
restrain
on
her
liberty
of
movement
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
i
think
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised,
same
claim
is
in
the
thompson
case.
the
district
court
in
that
case
which
was
upheld
on
appeal
stated,
“there
is
no
arbitrary
restraint
on
the
plaintiff's
right
to
live
where
they
please.”
and
this
court
when
out
to
say
something,
i
think
is
fundamental
in
this
case.
it
said,
“courts
will
proceed
with
great
caution
before
overthrowing
the
work
of
such
boards.
since
their
investigation
and
study
have
best
enabled
them
to
determine
what
regulations
will
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number,”
and
that
is
the
fundamental
aim
of
this
democracy.
now,
who
should
know
more
about
connecticut's
welfare
problems
than
the
duly
elected
legislative
subcommittee
that
recommended
17-2d
to
the
legislature
are
a
two-man
majority
of
the
three
judge
federal
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
yield
seven
minutes
of
my
time
to
argue
on
--
amicus
argument
and
the
remainder
of
the
time
to
mr.
sennett
from
pennsylvania
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
