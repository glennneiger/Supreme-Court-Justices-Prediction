mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
second
of
the
three
related
cases
before
the
court
today,
dealing
with
the
constitutionality
of
residency
requirements
for
public
assistance.
this
case
i
think,
presents
the
question
in
a
little
cleaner
posture
than
the
case
which
has
just
been
heard
and
that
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
makes
a
classification
between
those
who
have
been
here
for
one
year
and
those
who
have
not,
clean
across
the
board
without
ifs,
ands
or
buts.
it
applies
to
all
five
classifications
or
categories
of
public
assistance.
it
is
unlike
the
connecticut
statute
in
that
way
and
the
statutes
of
many
other
states
that
have
subclassifications
within
the
single
classification
of
a
one
year
residency
requirement.
now,
of
course
residency
requirements
are
not
new.
46
of
the
50
states
have
a
residency
requirement
for
at
least
one
category
of
public
assistance.
many
of
them
as
the
district
of
columbia
have
a
residency
requirement
for
all
categories
of
public
assistance.
others
have
it
for
some
but
not
all.
there
are
of
course
all
set
of
residency
requirements
in
other
fields
of
law
voting,
holding
both
public
and
semi-public
office
entitlement
to
licensure
of
various
profession
and
colleagues
and
in
many
other
areas.
as
we
see
the
problem
presented
in
this
case,
it
turns
upon
what
standard
is
to
be
applied
in
judging
this
classification.
now,
this
court
over
the
years
has
have
run
out
to
general
standards
toward
judging
the
constitutionality
of
legislative
acts.
that
is
what
i
would
call
the
general
standard
which
is
applied
in
most
cases
and
under
that
standard,
the
court
has
said
that
legislatures
have
a
very
wide
scope
of
discretion
in
classifying
the
citizens
in
the
two
different
classes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
the
same
standards
--
the
two
standards
had
been
applied
in
various
different
constitutional
attacks
that
is
whether
a
particular
act
is
constitutional
or
not
and
it
has
been
applied
in
many
circumstances
in
which
the
contention
similar
to
those
that
is
equal
protection
contentions
are
made.
now
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
is
of
course
in
cases
where
preferred
first
amendment
rights
or
freedoms
are
concerned.
this
exception
also
applies
where
there
are
classifications
based
upon
race,
color,
nationality
and
so
forth.
but
except
where
a
preferred
first
amendment
freedom
is
concerned
or
where
there
is
a
classification
based
upon
the
race,
the
general
rule
which
has
been
applied
by
the
court
is
that
the
statute
itself
is
given
a
presumptive
constitutionality
and
it
may
only
be
held
unconstitutional
where
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
facts
or
circumstances
which
would
justify
the
classification.
if
the
court
can
conceive
of
any
possible
justification
for
the
classification
then
its
constitutionality
must
be
upheld.
now,
that
of
course
does
not
apply
in
the
exceptional
cases
where
first
amendment
freedoms
are
concerned.
the
shoe
is
always
on
the
other
foot.
the
government
is
required
to
show
a
compelling
reason
for
any
legislation
which
infringes
upon
preferred
first
amendment
rights.
and
furthermore,
the
remedy,
the
provisions
of
the
statute
can
be
no
wider,
no
broader
than
the
evil
which
they
are
sought
to
control
or
the
problem
which
is
presented.
that
is
of
course
the
over
breadth
argument
which
is
applied
in
that
classification
of
cases.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
my
argument
is
your
honor
that
the
court
below
here
clearly
applied
a
standard
for
judging
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
act
applicable
to
first
amendment
areas
only.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
and
that
is
as
we
see
it,
the
principle
vice
of
the
majority
opinion
below
that
the
court
apply
to
the
wrong
standard
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
act
of
congress.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
to
some
extent
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
one
of
the
legitimate
purposes
of
this
act
is
to
protect
the
local
fisc
that
is
a
conceivable
purpose.
now,
not
to
keep
indigent
people
out
of
the
state
as
such,
the
appellees
violates
except
to
this
or
perhaps
arguendo
as
a
conceivable,
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
say
that
it
is
just
nonexistent
factual
issue
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
such
legislation
as
this,
to
keep
indigent
people
out
of
the
district
of
columbia.
they
just
don't
come
here
for
that
purpose
that
people
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
at
least
for
purposes
unassociated
with
public
assistance.
they
don't
even
think
how
much
public
assistance
if
any
that
they
will
get
when
they
come
here.
but
i
think
congress
could
well
have
had
in
mind
a
extraordinary
circumstances
such
as
we
are
faced
right
of
this
moment
in
this
city
as
the
court
is
i'm
sure
aware
there
is
plan
and
has
been
for
some
time
and
would
probably
be
in
progress
right
now
but
for
the
untimely
death
of
dr.
martin
luther
king,
poor
people's
marched
on
washington
whereby
it
was
proposed
to
bring
up
to
100,000
poor
people
into
the
district
of
columbia
to
remain
here
indefinitely
until
they
obtain
the
rights
to
which
they
believe
they
were
entitled.
now,
let
us
assume
that
happens
and
it
is
certainly
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility
that
it
may
a
100,000
poor
people
suddenly
descend
upon
washington.
if
we
are
to
judge
their
eligibility
for
public
assistance
by
the
standard
that
the
court
below
said
was
proper,
number
one,
you
are
physically
present
in
the
district
of
columbia.
number
two,
you
have
an
intention
to
remain
here
indefinitely.
every
one
of
those
100,000
people
if
they
were
needy
would
be
eligible
for
public
assistance.
that
would
just
open
the
drain,
pull
the
plug
out
of
the
fiscal
bathtub
and
there
would
be
no
money
left
for
the
administration
of
the
program
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
that
that
could
have
been
a
conceivable
purpose
that
such
an
unusual
situation
such
as
this
could
have
come
about
that
congress
could
have
had
in
its
mind.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no
your
honor,
i
cannot.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
i
am
aware
of
that
would
support
the
proposition
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
poor
people's
march
on
washington.
there
is
i
think
mentioned
of
extraordinary
circumstances
but
not
anything
specific
like
this.
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act,
that
is
the
act
that
was
--
a
bill
that
was
enacted
as
this
act
is
rather
skimpy.
there
were
bills
introduced
in
prior
sessions
of
congress,
containing
almost
identical
provisions
upon
which
there
were
very
extensive
hearings
and
as
to
the
contention
incidentally
that
the
congress
just
threw
this
in
as
an
after
thought
without
giving
much
attention
to
it
or
without
really
considering
what
it
meant
or
what
its
purpose
was.
i
think
it
is
destroyed
by
the
hearings
on
the
prior
bills.
there
were
very
extensive
hearings
on
bill
as
2363
of
the
86th
congress,
second
session
and
before
the
committee
at
that
time,
every
conceivable
argument
against
the
residency
requirement,
i
think
it
was
advanced
upon
the
committee
and
upon
the
congress.
so
the
congress
was
familiar
with
every
one
of
these
arguments
against
it
and
they
still
enacted
a
one
year
residency
requirement.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
that
is
conceived
but
i
do
not
think
the
congress
or
the
district
of
columbia
could
consist
with
the
constitution
and
prevent
them
from
coming
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
just
because
of
edwards
but
i
think
that
the
constitutional
rights
to
travel
would
definitely
prevent
a
absolute
prohibition
against
coming
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
not
to
any
extent
which
infringes
upon
constitutional
--
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
to
some
extent
it
would.
that
is
if
someone
get
it
for
a
year
that
may
discourage
her
from
coming
here
but
of
course
we
have
similar
(audio
cut)--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
was
not
aware
of
that
specific
argument
but
of
course,
the
statute
involved
in
edwards
was
quite
different
from
this.
this
was
--
that
statute
was
close
to
our
prohibition
against
coming
in
at
least
a
criminal
penalized
anybody
who
assisted
an
indigent
from
entering
the
state.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
am
saying
that
and
i
think
i
have
to
go
beyond
that
your
honor
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
sufficiently
severe
restriction
upon
the
right
to
travel
to
infringe
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution
because
you
recall
in
guest,
the
justices
split
as
to
the
source
of
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel.
it
is
not
an
agreement
as
to
where
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
constitution
although
there
is
agreement
that
it
exist
but
whether
it's
in
the
commerce
clause
or
in
any
other
provision,
our
position
is
that
this
restriction
does
not
arise
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
think
that
the
congress
could,
consisted
with
the
constitution
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
public
assistance,
you
are
not
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
unless
you
have
been
here
for
one
year
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
outside
the
scope
of
them.
i
do
not
make
the
argument.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
specifically.
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act
is
somewhat
skimpy.
now
the
court
below
suggested
three
possible
grounds
or
reasons
fro
the
congress
enacting
this
particular
provision.
one
was
to
protect
the
local
fisc
that
we
have
already
discussed.
two
was
to
prevent
fraud
and
three
was
what
the
other
side
calls
administrative
convenience
that
is
there
are
all
kinds
of
difficult,
factual
and
legal
problems
which
can
arise
in
determining
whether
or
not
one
is
a
resident
in
various
context.
whether
or
not
--
of
course
you
have
to
be
physically
be
here
but
what
about
your
intention
to
permanently
remain
here
or
indefinitely
remain
here.
if
you're
here
just
to
treat
a
sick
relative,
you
meet
that.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
one
year
i
think
your
honor.
would
that
have
done
it?
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
congressional
history
that
i
know
of
that
they
acquitted
those
two.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
particular
act,
the
62
act,
there
were
other
acts
of
congress
covering
public
assistance,
separate
acts
as
to
each
category
and
each
category
had
a
different
residency
requirements.
some
of
them
are
up
to
five
years
and
above
all
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
shows
is,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
the
residency
requirement
for
each
classification
the
same
and
to
make
it
at
one
year.
now,
there
may
have
been
another
possible
reason
under
the
federal
legislation
which
funds
most
of
these
programs.
there
is
a
limitation
of
one
year
maximum
on
the
residency
requirement
of
a
state
that
is
in
order
to
receive
federal
funds,
you
have
to
have
an
approved
program
of
public
assistance
in
the
state,
and
the
program
will
not
be
approved
if
the
residency
requirement
exceeds
one
year.
so
the
congress
has
specifically
authorized
in
that
sense
all
states
to
establish
a
residency
requirement
of
up
to
one
year
but
no
more.
now,
the
state
of
course
is
not
required
to
accept
federal
funds
if
he
wants
to
conduct
a
program
entirely
of
its
own
funds,
it
can
do
so
and
have
any
residency
requirement
he
wants
to
as
far
as
that
legislation
is
concerned.
but
from
the
practical
standpoint,
the
states
want
the
federal
funds
so
they
have
cut
their
residency
requirement
down
to
one
year.
now,
that
--
it
may
have
been
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation
to
make
the
residency
requirement
which
it
was
permitted
of
all
states,
a
one
year
residency
requirement
the
same
as
that
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
again,
i
cannot
point
to
anything
specifically
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
support
that.
now,
there
is
the
contention
made
here
by
the
appellees.
it
has
been
made
in
the
other
three
cases
here
of
the
right
to
travel,
freedom
of
movement
argument.
now,
it
does
not
appear
that
the
majority
of
the
court
here
expressly
relied
upon
that
ground
and
declaring
this
statute
unconstitutional.
their
stated
ground
was
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection.
but
their
reliance
upon
such
cases
as
edwards
and
kent,
aptheker,
i
think
clearly
indicated
that
at
least
as
an
alternate
ground
or
perhaps
a
part
of
their
original
ground,
they
were
relying
upon
a
violation
of
the
right
to
travel.
now,
that
comes
back
to
the
appropriate
standard.
the
argument
is
made
here
that
the
standard
which
this
court
has
applied
in
first
amendment
cases
is
the
proper
standard
here.
and
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
if
the
court
is
to
judge
this
legislation
by
the
standards
that
it
applies
to
a
legislative
act
which
infringes
directly
a
first
amendment
right
of
association,
communication
religion
that
it
could
not
stand
out.
the
question
is,
is
that
the
appropriate
standard?
and
i
think
there
is
where
the
court
below
went
off
and
the
courts
in
the
other
cases
which
stricken
down
such
legislation
have
gone
off.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
as
i
say.
our
statute
has
the
same
one
year
residence
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
not
given
too
much
thought
to
that
distinction.perhaps,
there
are
distinction
between
old
age
assistance
and
the
others.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
our
statute,
you're
not
only
have
to
be
here
for
one
year
immediately
proceeding
the
date
of
your
application
for
old
age
assistance
but
you
had
to
have
lived
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
five
out
of
the
last
nine
years
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
old
age
assistance
is
the
only
category
which
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
other
four
categories
are.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
that
is
true.
it's
a
clear
classification
here
either
you
have
been
here
one
year
or
more
or
you
haven't
and
what
other
considerations,
age,
illegitimacy
or
anything
are
not
considered
but
the
point
about
the
right
to
travel
i
think
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
a
--
if
not
really
a
first
amendment
freedom
right,
at
least
something
so
akin
to
it
that
it
should
be
judged
by
the
same
standard
that
a
infringement
upon
a
first
amendment
right
is
judged
by.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no
your
honor,
in
zemel
versus
rusk
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
exactly
the
contrary
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
it
could
be
stated
that
way.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
would
say
the
court
should
and
could
test
the
case
here
by
the
proper
standards.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
standards
which
the
statute
should
be
judged
by
are
those
declared
in
mcgowan,
mclaughlin
and
so
forth.
and
if
judged
by
those
standards,
i
think
there
are
conceivable
rational
basis
for
this
particular
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
those
are
sufficient,
yes
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
getting
back
just
a
moment
to
the
standard
which
should
be
applicable
here,
i
think
the
case
of
nestor
versus
flemming
is
the
closest
case
that
we
have
in
this
court
to
the
problem
presented
here.
we
discussed
and
rely
upon
in
our
brief
that's
relegated
to
a
footnote
in
the
appellee's
brief.
their
argument
is
that
that
was
decided
way
back
in
1960.
it's
per
se
now
it's
on
law.
you
can't
pay
any
attention
to
it
nowadays.
there's
too
much
happened
since
then.
flemming
versus
nestor
dealt
with
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act
which
cut
off
assistance
benefits
to
any
person
who
is
deported.
now,
the
fund
from
which
the
payments
were
made
there
was
one
into
which
the
applicant
had
paid
funds.
it's
unlike
the
situation
here
where
you
have
a
pure
fortuity,
the
person
had,
well
something
close
to
a
contractual
interest
in
these
funds.
the
court
nevertheless
said,
particularly
when
we
deal
with
a
withholding
of
a
non-contractual
benefit
under
a
social
welfare
program
such
as
this,
we
must
recognize
that
the
due
process
clause
can
be
thought
to
interpose
a
bar
only
if
the
statute
manifest
patently
arbitrary
classification,
utterly
lacking
in
rational
justification.
now,
that
is
the
standard
which
we
ask
the
court
to
apply
to
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
that
is
flemming
versus
nestor.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
on
the
case
of
washington
versus
legrant
which
defers
in
some
respect
from
the
other
two
cases.
in
that,
first,
it
involves
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
as
distinguished
from
a
state
legislative
act
and
at
least
insofar
as
connecticut
is
concerned.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
differs
considerably
and
that
it
imposes
a
one
year
residence
requirement
across
the
board
to
all
categories
without
respect
to
how
much
money
you
may
have
had
when
you
came
into
the
jurisdiction
or
any
other
contingent
provision.
the
question
presented
is
of
course
whether
or
not
the
provision
of
the
district
of
columbia
act
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
made
apical
in
the
district
of
columbia
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that
the
statute
makes
a
classification
is
clear.
it
distinguishes
between
those
who
have
been
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
one
year
and
those
who
have
not
insofar
as
eligibility
for
public
assistance
is
concerned.
the
question
is
of
course
whether
or
not
this
classification
is
an
invidious
classification
to
use
the
word
that
this
court
has
many
times
used.
now,
i
think
in
answering
that
question,
it
is
necessary
to
determine
by
what
standard
this
classification
is
to
be
judged
and
this
court
over
the
years
has
hammered
out
a
standard
and
what
i
would
call
an
exception
to
that
standard
or
if
you
like
possibly
two
standards.
the
first
standard
which
is
the
traditional
standard,
the
standard
which
is
applied
to
legislative
classifications
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
provides
that
the
legislative
enactment
is
presumed
to
be
constitutional,
that
legislatures
have
a
broad
scope
of
discretion
in
making
classifications
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
challenging
or
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
classification
to
show
that
the
classification
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
any
conceivable
legislative
purpose,
and
that
every
fact
or
reason
which
could
support
the
classification
will
be
presumed,
and
further
that
whether
or
not
any
of
these
conceivable
or
possible
legislative
purposes
that
may
underlie
the
statute
where
the
ones,
in
fact,
which
prompted
their
legislature
to
enact
the
statute
or
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
of
course,
constitutionally
irrelevant.
now,
the
second
standard
or
what
i
would
call
the
exception
to
the
general
standard
is
that
which
has
been
applied
in
cases
where
the
classification
directly
infringes
upon
a
preferred
freedom
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
where
the
classification
is
based
upon
race,
color
or
national
origin.
now
under
that
standard,
the
classification
is
immediately
suspect.
i
think
something
very
close
to
a
presumption
upon
constitutionality
arises
and
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
reason
for
that
classification.
and
even
when
the
government
can
show
a
compelling
reason,
the
statute
can
go
no
further
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
legislative
purpose.
now,
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
here
is
--
depends
upon
by
which
standard
the
district
of
columbia
public
assistance
act
of
1962
is
to
be
judged.if
by
the
first
standard,
i
think
it
is
clearly
constitutional.
if
by
the
second
standard,
then
it
is
probably
unconstitutional.
now,
that
the
court
below
applied
the
exceptional
standard,
the
standard
which
this
court
has
applied
to
first
amendment
freedom
cases
and
classifications
based
upon
race
is
clear,
i
think,
both
from
the
opinion
itself,
from
the
statutes
or
from
the
cases
upon
which
the
court
relies,
and
is
of
course
recognized
by
appellees.
indeed,
they
urge
strongly
upon
the
court
that
that
is
the
correct
standard
and
that
under
that
standard,
the
statute
is
still
constitutional.
although,
they
do
later
retreat
to
the
position
that
even
if
the
general
standard
is
the
proper
one,
it
is
unconstitutional.
now,
what
conceivable
legislative
purposes
underlie
this
particular
classification?
the
court
below
discussed
various
possibilities.
we
would
submit
that
there
are
at
least
three
which
would
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
classification.
not
that
these
are
the
only
ones
or
that
this
is
exhausted.
the
first
of
this
is
to
permit
the
local
government
to
plan
its
fiscal
affairs
on
a
year-to-year
basis.
now,
that
has
been
argued
already
before
you
at
some
length.
but
i
think
that
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose
which
would
support
the
constitutionality
of
this
classification.
i
might
say
that
i
asked
the
budget
director
of
the
district
of
columbia
department
of
public
welfare
to
prepare
some
figures
and
projections
as
to
how
the
injunction
under
which
the
welfare
authorities
have
been
since
the
latter
part
of
last
year
was
affecting
the
district
of
columbia's
welfare
program.
and
the
budget
director
took
the
figures
both
by
an
average
caseload
basis
and
by
the
monetary
sums
for
the
first
10
months
of
--
first
eight
months
rather
of
1968
and
compared
those
to
the
first
10
months
of
1967.
and
the
figures
reflect
an
increase
in
the
budget
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
about
a
110%,
substantially,
more
than
double.
now,
some
of
that
of
course
may
due
to
a
backlog
but
that's
the
abolition
of
this
classification
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
least
will
result
in
a
very
substantial
increase
in
the
budget
is
clear.
the
district
would
then
have
to
do
either
one
of
two
things.
it
would
have
to
increase
its
budget,
find
more
money
or
cut
down
the
amount
of
the
grants
to
the
individual
recipients.
now,
the
second
proper
legislative
purpose,
which
we
would
say
underlies
the
statute,
is
the
protection
of
--
and
--
of
fraud,
the
prevention
and
detection
of
fraud.
now,
the
appellees,
as
i
understand
them,
concede
that
the
prevention
and
detection
of
fraud
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
they
concede
further
that
the
one-year
residency
requirement
is
an
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose.
they
argue,
however,
that
it
is
not
a
particularly
effective
aid.
it
is
not
in
their
view,
at
least,
the
most
effective
or
best
means
of
protecting
fraud.
and
they
invoke
again
the
argument,
which
has
been
applied
by
this
court,
only
to
cases
within
the
exception.
and
that
is,
they
say
that
even
if
this
is
true,
a
proper
legislative
purpose
and
that
this
serves
that
purpose,
it
goes
beyond
what
is
absolutely
necessary
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
now,
that
standard
applies
only
to
the
exceptional
first
amendment
cases
and
we
submit
it
not
to
this
type
of
case.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i'm
not
sure
we
have
anything,
mr.
justice
marshall.
perhaps,
nine
months
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
perhaps
one
month
but
that
is
a
determination
which
the
legislature
has
to
make,
we
submit.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
it
is
--
the
well
is
not
bottomless.
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
in
legislating
for
the
district
of
columbia
acts
as
a
local
legislature.
it,
of
course,
acts
as
a
federal
legislature
otherwise.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
that
would
be
up
to
congress.
the
congress
could
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
ask
the
court
to
say
--
say
that.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
or
appropriate,
find
a
source
of
additional
funds.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
is.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
the
money
would
be,
of
course,
appropriated
by
the
congress
and
by
taxing
the
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
their
property.
there
are
two
sources
of
income
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
some
from
taxes,
some
from
grants
or
money
appropriated
by
the
congress.
the
third
proper
legislative
purpose,
which
we
would
say
could
underly
this
statute,
relates
to
the
residency.determination
of
what
is
residency
or
a
bona
fide
resident.
i
think
it
is
conceded
that
a
state
legislature
or
the
congress
of
the
united
states
acting
as
such
for
the
district
of
columbia
can
condition
public
assistance
grants
on
residency
that
is
provide
grants
only
to
bona
fide
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
distinguished
from
those
who
may
be
temporarily
sojourning
in
the
district
of
columbia
passing
through
visiting
friends,
relatives
and
so
forth
here
or
just
wondering
about
the
country.
now,
how
do
you
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
a
community?
with
a
normal
individual,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
or
things
that
you
could
look
to.
he
buys
a
house.
he
opens
a
bank
account.
he
opens
charge
accounts.
those,
of
course,
could
not
generally
be
applied
to
the
indigent.
all
he
would
generally
have
was
their
word
on
here
and
i
intend
to
remain
here
indefinitely.
but
by
the
very
nature
of
their
indigency,
they
come
here.
they
look
for
a
job.
if
they
don't
find
it,
they
move
on
to
another
city.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
does
some
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
--requirements.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
there
are
other
standards
that
can
be
worked
out
but
we
would
submit
that
the
congress
here
has
used
this
one-year
residency
provision
as
an
objective
legislative
test
for
determining
residency.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
--
i
think
they
were
--
they
are
overlapping.
you
would
have
to
determine,
of
course,
residence
and
then
the
duration
if
you
are
involved
in
the
one-year
requirement
here.
but
under
this
requirement,
the
intention
of
the
person
coming
here
is
immaterial.
you
may
have
come
here
to
get
higher
grants
for
anyone
of
a
thousand
things.
if
he
has
been
here
for
one
year,
regardless
of
why
he
came
here,
he
is
entitled
public
assistance.
if
he
has
not
been
here
one
year,
then
he
is
not.
it
saves
the
district
of
columbia
welfare
officials
the
many
difficult
problems
of
determining
who
is
a
bona
fide
resident.
now,
intent
is
one
of
the
elements
why
a
person
came
to
a
jurisdiction.
his
purpose
in
coming
there
is
another
factor.
does
he
intend
to
remain
there
indefinitely
or
permanently?
many
indigent
people
just
can't
say
that.
i'm
here
and
i
don't
know
how
long
i'm
going
to
be.
if
i
get
--
find
a
good
job,
i
may
stay
indefinitely.
if
i
don't,
i
may
move
on.
now,
to
avoid
the
difficulties
which
would
arise
from
trying
to
determine
each
of
these
cases
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
the
congress
just
says,
“here's
one
standard
regardless
of
all
else,
your
purpose,
your
intention,
anything
else,
if
you've
been
here
one
year,
that's
it.
you
are
a
bona
fide
resident.
if
you
haven't,
you
are
not.”
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
at
least,
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia
is
concerned,
as
i
understand
it
as
the
law
is
here
administered.
if
you
have
been
physically
present
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
one
year,
then
you
are
eligible
for
public
assistance.
regardless
of
whether
when
you
initially
came
here
or
came
to
visit
my
relatives,
i
intended
to
go
back
in
a
month
of
two
or
three
months.
i
came
here
for
any
other
temporary
purpose
and
later
decided
to
stay
on.
that's
not
used
at
all.
if
you're
physically
present
here
for
one
year,
that's
it.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
an
argument
which
has
been
advanced
by
necessity
by
the
appellees.
because,
only
if
the
court
accepts
their
argument
that
this
statute
does
infringe
upon
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel.
and
their
further
argument
that
--
that
the
right
to
travel
is
equivalent
or
in
the
same
class
as
the
first
amendment
preferred
right.
and
if
the
court
accepts
both
those
arguments,
then
the
exceptional
standard
in
judging
those
classifications,
constitutionality
would
apply
here.
and
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
it
would
probably
be
unconstitutional
under
that
standard.
now,
that
this
statute
incidentally
and
indirectly
may
discourage
travel
i
think
is
apparent.
but
it
is
our
position
that
it
does
not
arise
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
the
extent
of
the
infringement
upon
it.
there
is
no
direct
infringement.
this
court
has
dealt
with
a
right
to
travel,
of
course,
in
edwards
versus
california
and
the
various
passport
cases
and
the
guest
case
arising
in
georgia
and
so
forth.
but
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
a
direct
infringement
upon
the
right
to
travel
not
as
here
a
mere
discouragement.
but
let's
explore
for
a
minute
what
would
be
the
affect
of
holding
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
infringement
of
the
right
to
travel
where
you
have
state
a
that
has
a
very
low
grant,
where
you
have
state
b
that
has
a
very
generous
grant.
we
have
an
individual
in
state
b
that
wants
to
go
to
state
a.
i
am
discouraged
from
traveling
to
state
a
says
the
individual.
because
if
i
go
there,
the
grant
is
only
one-quarter,
one-fifth
of
what
i
am
receiving
in
this
state.
now,
would
that
then
mean
that
the
state
with
a
low
grant
would
be
constitutionally
required
to
up
its
grant
to
that
of
the
most
generous
state
because
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
grants
and
state
displayed
is
tremendous.
and
you
could
make
this
argument
just
as
effectively
between
the
amounts
of
assistance
granted
as
a
discouragement
to
travel,
perhaps
moreso
than
you
could
the
residence
a
requirement
because
the
residency
requirement
is
all
over
in
one
year.
the
grant
of
public
assistance
extends
indefinitely
as
long
as
you
are
in
need
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
is.
of
course,
the
holding
of
the
court
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
well,
this
is,
of
course,
federal
legislation
and
the
congress
can
put
burdens
upon
interstate
travel.
so
insofar
as
this
act
is
concerned
as
distinguished
in
the
state
acts,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
for
the
reason
that
the
court
found
that
california
statute
in
edwards
unconstitutional
as
improper
infringement
upon
interstate
commerce.
this
is
an
act
of
the
federal
legislature.
but
the
same
argument,
i
think,
could
be
applied
and
extended
insofar
as
interference
with
the
right
to
travel
by
differences
and
licensure
in
one
state.
here
i'm
a
plumber,
a
brick
player,
whatnot.
i'm
working
in
this
state.
i
want
to
travel
to
another
state.
it's
requirements
of
licensure
as
such
that
i
cannot
meet
it.
now,
that
would
discourage
me
from
traveling.
but
would
that
make
the
license
statute
of
the
other
state
unconstitutional?
i
might
say
just
a
word,
if
i
may,
about
the
applicability
of
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act
to
this
situation.
appellees
in
their
supplemental
brief
on
page
42
suggests
that
the
congress
in
enacting
this
provision,
which
of
course,
provides
for
federal
grants
to
state
programs
but
with
a
condition
limiting
the
residency
requirement
to
one
year.
they
say
that
the
congress
did
not
face
the
question
whether
any
period
of
residence
should
be
required.
now,
that's
just
plain
not
true.
when
the
congress
enacted
this,
it
knew.
and
in
fact,
this
was
urged
on
it
by
per
--
those
who
thought
residency
requirements
were
unwise.
you
can
handle
this
whole
problem
by
just
saying
you
don't
get
any
federal
grant
if
you
have
any
residency
requirement.
and
had
the
congress
seem
fit
to
do
that
that
would
have
effectively
abolished
residency
requirements.
because
while
in
theory,
a
state
could
still
operate
its
own
welfare
program
without
federal
grants,
it
would
almost
certainly
not
do
so
since
overall
the
federal
grants
make
up
about
57%
of
the
welfare
monies.
if
i
may
say
just
one
word
as
to
the
vera
barley
case
which
is
the
case
involving
the
lady
who
is
in
st.
elizabeth's
hospital
and
who
applied
for
public
assistance
and
even
though
she
had
been
there
for
years
and
years
under
a
regulation
of
the
department,
she
was
found
to
be
ineligible
because
they
would
not
permit
residency
in
a
public
institution
such
as
st.elizabeth's
to
be
counted.
now,
the
court
below
in
footnote
19
struck
down
that
regulation.
we
do
not
challenge
their
ruling
on
that.
so
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
case
here,
i
think,
as
far
as
vera
barley
is
concerned,
as
whether
or
not
the
one-year
residency
requirement
would
apply
to
her.
i
will
say
one
word
about
the
various
amici
briefs
that
had
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
position
here
and
remind
the
court
what
it
has
so
often
said
before
that
our
concern
here
is
with
power
and
not
with
wisdom.
i
think
that
bear
stressing
because
i
think
almost
the
entire
argument
in
the
amici
briefs
on
behalf
of
appellees
position
and
a
great
deal
of
the
argument
of
appellees
themselves
go
to
the
question
of
wisdom
and
not
power.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
second
of
the
three
related
cases
before
the
court
today,
dealing
with
the
constitutionality
of
residency
requirements
for
public
assistance.
this
case
i
think,
presents
the
question
in
a
little
cleaner
posture
than
the
case
which
has
just
been
heard
and
that
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
makes
a
classification
between
those
who
have
been
here
for
one
year
and
those
who
have
not,
clean
across
the
board
without
ifs,
ands
or
buts.
it
applies
to
all
five
classifications
or
categories
of
public
assistance.
it
is
unlike
the
connecticut
statute
in
that
way
and
the
statutes
of
many
other
states
that
have
subclassifications
within
the
single
classification
of
a
one
year
residency
requirement.
now,
of
course
residency
requirements
are
not
new.
46
of
the
50
states
have
a
residency
requirement
for
at
least
one
category
of
public
assistance.
many
of
them
as
the
district
of
columbia
have
a
residency
requirement
for
all
categories
of
public
assistance.
others
have
it
for
some
but
not
all.
there
are
of
course
all
set
of
residency
requirements
in
other
fields
of
law
voting,
holding
both
public
and
semi-public
office
entitlement
to
licensure
of
various
profession
and
colleagues
and
in
many
other
areas.
as
we
see
the
problem
presented
in
this
case,
it
turns
upon
what
standard
is
to
be
applied
in
judging
this
classification.
now,
this
court
over
the
years
has
have
run
out
to
general
standards
toward
judging
the
constitutionality
of
legislative
acts.
that
is
what
i
would
call
the
general
standard
which
is
applied
in
most
cases
and
under
that
standard,
the
court
has
said
that
legislatures
have
a
very
wide
scope
of
discretion
in
classifying
the
citizens
in
the
two
different
classes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
the
same
standards
--
the
two
standards
had
been
applied
in
various
different
constitutional
attacks
that
is
whether
a
particular
act
is
constitutional
or
not
and
it
has
been
applied
in
many
circumstances
in
which
the
contention
similar
to
those
that
is
equal
protection
contentions
are
made.
now
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
is
of
course
in
cases
where
preferred
first
amendment
rights
or
freedoms
are
concerned.
this
exception
also
applies
where
there
are
classifications
based
upon
race,
color,
nationality
and
so
forth.
but
except
where
a
preferred
first
amendment
freedom
is
concerned
or
where
there
is
a
classification
based
upon
the
race,
the
general
rule
which
has
been
applied
by
the
court
is
that
the
statute
itself
is
given
a
presumptive
constitutionality
and
it
may
only
be
held
unconstitutional
where
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
facts
or
circumstances
which
would
justify
the
classification.
if
the
court
can
conceive
of
any
possible
justification
for
the
classification
then
its
constitutionality
must
be
upheld.
now,
that
of
course
does
not
apply
in
the
exceptional
cases
where
first
amendment
freedoms
are
concerned.
the
shoe
is
always
on
the
other
foot.
the
government
is
required
to
show
a
compelling
reason
for
any
legislation
which
infringes
upon
preferred
first
amendment
rights.
and
furthermore,
the
remedy,
the
provisions
of
the
statute
can
be
no
wider,
no
broader
than
the
evil
which
they
are
sought
to
control
or
the
problem
which
is
presented.
that
is
of
course
the
over
breadth
argument
which
is
applied
in
that
classification
of
cases.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
my
argument
is
your
honor
that
the
court
below
here
clearly
applied
a
standard
for
judging
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
act
applicable
to
first
amendment
areas
only.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
and
that
is
as
we
see
it,
the
principle
vice
of
the
majority
opinion
below
that
the
court
apply
to
the
wrong
standard
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
act
of
congress.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
to
some
extent
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
one
of
the
legitimate
purposes
of
this
act
is
to
protect
the
local
fisc
that
is
a
conceivable
purpose.
now,
not
to
keep
indigent
people
out
of
the
state
as
such,
the
appellees
violates
except
to
this
or
perhaps
arguendo
as
a
conceivable,
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
say
that
it
is
just
nonexistent
factual
issue
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
such
legislation
as
this,
to
keep
indigent
people
out
of
the
district
of
columbia.
they
just
don't
come
here
for
that
purpose
that
people
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
at
least
for
purposes
unassociated
with
public
assistance.
they
don't
even
think
how
much
public
assistance
if
any
that
they
will
get
when
they
come
here.
but
i
think
congress
could
well
have
had
in
mind
a
extraordinary
circumstances
such
as
we
are
faced
right
of
this
moment
in
this
city
as
the
court
is
i'm
sure
aware
there
is
plan
and
has
been
for
some
time
and
would
probably
be
in
progress
right
now
but
for
the
untimely
death
of
dr.
martin
luther
king,
poor
people's
marched
on
washington
whereby
it
was
proposed
to
bring
up
to
100,000
poor
people
into
the
district
of
columbia
to
remain
here
indefinitely
until
they
obtain
the
rights
to
which
they
believe
they
were
entitled.
now,
let
us
assume
that
happens
and
it
is
certainly
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility
that
it
may
a
100,000
poor
people
suddenly
descend
upon
washington.
if
we
are
to
judge
their
eligibility
for
public
assistance
by
the
standard
that
the
court
below
said
was
proper,
number
one,
you
are
physically
present
in
the
district
of
columbia.
number
two,
you
have
an
intention
to
remain
here
indefinitely.
every
one
of
those
100,000
people
if
they
were
needy
would
be
eligible
for
public
assistance.
that
would
just
open
the
drain,
pull
the
plug
out
of
the
fiscal
bathtub
and
there
would
be
no
money
left
for
the
administration
of
the
program
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
that
that
could
have
been
a
conceivable
purpose
that
such
an
unusual
situation
such
as
this
could
have
come
about
that
congress
could
have
had
in
its
mind.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no
your
honor,
i
cannot.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
i
am
aware
of
that
would
support
the
proposition
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
poor
people's
march
on
washington.
there
is
i
think
mentioned
of
extraordinary
circumstances
but
not
anything
specific
like
this.
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act,
that
is
the
act
that
was
--
a
bill
that
was
enacted
as
this
act
is
rather
skimpy.
there
were
bills
introduced
in
prior
sessions
of
congress,
containing
almost
identical
provisions
upon
which
there
were
very
extensive
hearings
and
as
to
the
contention
incidentally
that
the
congress
just
threw
this
in
as
an
after
thought
without
giving
much
attention
to
it
or
without
really
considering
what
it
meant
or
what
its
purpose
was.
i
think
it
is
destroyed
by
the
hearings
on
the
prior
bills.
there
were
very
extensive
hearings
on
bill
as
2363
of
the
86th
congress,
second
session
and
before
the
committee
at
that
time,
every
conceivable
argument
against
the
residency
requirement,
i
think
it
was
advanced
upon
the
committee
and
upon
the
congress.
so
the
congress
was
familiar
with
every
one
of
these
arguments
against
it
and
they
still
enacted
a
one
year
residency
requirement.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
that
is
conceived
but
i
do
not
think
the
congress
or
the
district
of
columbia
could
consist
with
the
constitution
and
prevent
them
from
coming
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
just
because
of
edwards
but
i
think
that
the
constitutional
rights
to
travel
would
definitely
prevent
a
absolute
prohibition
against
coming
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
not
to
any
extent
which
infringes
upon
constitutional
--
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
to
some
extent
it
would.
that
is
if
someone
get
it
for
a
year
that
may
discourage
her
from
coming
here
but
of
course
we
have
similar
(audio
cut)--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
was
not
aware
of
that
specific
argument
but
of
course,
the
statute
involved
in
edwards
was
quite
different
from
this.
this
was
--
that
statute
was
close
to
our
prohibition
against
coming
in
at
least
a
criminal
penalized
anybody
who
assisted
an
indigent
from
entering
the
state.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
am
saying
that
and
i
think
i
have
to
go
beyond
that
your
honor
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
sufficiently
severe
restriction
upon
the
right
to
travel
to
infringe
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution
because
you
recall
in
guest,
the
justices
split
as
to
the
source
of
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel.
it
is
not
an
agreement
as
to
where
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
constitution
although
there
is
agreement
that
it
exist
but
whether
it's
in
the
commerce
clause
or
in
any
other
provision,
our
position
is
that
this
restriction
does
not
arise
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
think
that
the
congress
could,
consisted
with
the
constitution
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
public
assistance,
you
are
not
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
unless
you
have
been
here
for
one
year
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
outside
the
scope
of
them.
i
do
not
make
the
argument.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
specifically.
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act
is
somewhat
skimpy.
now
the
court
below
suggested
three
possible
grounds
or
reasons
fro
the
congress
enacting
this
particular
provision.
one
was
to
protect
the
local
fisc
that
we
have
already
discussed.
two
was
to
prevent
fraud
and
three
was
what
the
other
side
calls
administrative
convenience
that
is
there
are
all
kinds
of
difficult,
factual
and
legal
problems
which
can
arise
in
determining
whether
or
not
one
is
a
resident
in
various
context.
whether
or
not
--
of
course
you
have
to
be
physically
be
here
but
what
about
your
intention
to
permanently
remain
here
or
indefinitely
remain
here.
if
you're
here
just
to
treat
a
sick
relative,
you
meet
that.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
one
year
i
think
your
honor.
would
that
have
done
it?
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
congressional
history
that
i
know
of
that
they
acquitted
those
two.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
particular
act,
the
62
act,
there
were
other
acts
of
congress
covering
public
assistance,
separate
acts
as
to
each
category
and
each
category
had
a
different
residency
requirements.
some
of
them
are
up
to
five
years
and
above
all
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
shows
is,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
the
residency
requirement
for
each
classification
the
same
and
to
make
it
at
one
year.
now,
there
may
have
been
another
possible
reason
under
the
federal
legislation
which
funds
most
of
these
programs.
there
is
a
limitation
of
one
year
maximum
on
the
residency
requirement
of
a
state
that
is
in
order
to
receive
federal
funds,
you
have
to
have
an
approved
program
of
public
assistance
in
the
state,
and
the
program
will
not
be
approved
if
the
residency
requirement
exceeds
one
year.
so
the
congress
has
specifically
authorized
in
that
sense
all
states
to
establish
a
residency
requirement
of
up
to
one
year
but
no
more.
now,
the
state
of
course
is
not
required
to
accept
federal
funds
if
he
wants
to
conduct
a
program
entirely
of
its
own
funds,
it
can
do
so
and
have
any
residency
requirement
he
wants
to
as
far
as
that
legislation
is
concerned.
but
from
the
practical
standpoint,
the
states
want
the
federal
funds
so
they
have
cut
their
residency
requirement
down
to
one
year.
now,
that
--
it
may
have
been
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation
to
make
the
residency
requirement
which
it
was
permitted
of
all
states,
a
one
year
residency
requirement
the
same
as
that
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
again,
i
cannot
point
to
anything
specifically
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
support
that.
now,
there
is
the
contention
made
here
by
the
appellees.
it
has
been
made
in
the
other
three
cases
here
of
the
right
to
travel,
freedom
of
movement
argument.
now,
it
does
not
appear
that
the
majority
of
the
court
here
expressly
relied
upon
that
ground
and
declaring
this
statute
unconstitutional.
their
stated
ground
was
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection.
but
their
reliance
upon
such
cases
as
edwards
and
kent,
aptheker,
i
think
clearly
indicated
that
at
least
as
an
alternate
ground
or
perhaps
a
part
of
their
original
ground,
they
were
relying
upon
a
violation
of
the
right
to
travel.
now,
that
comes
back
to
the
appropriate
standard.
the
argument
is
made
here
that
the
standard
which
this
court
has
applied
in
first
amendment
cases
is
the
proper
standard
here.
and
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
if
the
court
is
to
judge
this
legislation
by
the
standards
that
it
applies
to
a
legislative
act
which
infringes
directly
a
first
amendment
right
of
association,
communication
religion
that
it
could
not
stand
out.
the
question
is,
is
that
the
appropriate
standard?
and
i
think
there
is
where
the
court
below
went
off
and
the
courts
in
the
other
cases
which
stricken
down
such
legislation
have
gone
off.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
as
i
say.
our
statute
has
the
same
one
year
residence
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
not
given
too
much
thought
to
that
distinction.perhaps,
there
are
distinction
between
old
age
assistance
and
the
others.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
our
statute,
you're
not
only
have
to
be
here
for
one
year
immediately
proceeding
the
date
of
your
application
for
old
age
assistance
but
you
had
to
have
lived
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
five
out
of
the
last
nine
years
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
old
age
assistance
is
the
only
category
which
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
other
four
categories
are.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
that
is
true.
it's
a
clear
classification
here
either
you
have
been
here
one
year
or
more
or
you
haven't
and
what
other
considerations,
age,
illegitimacy
or
anything
are
not
considered
but
the
point
about
the
right
to
travel
i
think
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
a
--
if
not
really
a
first
amendment
freedom
right,
at
least
something
so
akin
to
it
that
it
should
be
judged
by
the
same
standard
that
a
infringement
upon
a
first
amendment
right
is
judged
by.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no
your
honor,
in
zemel
versus
rusk
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
exactly
the
contrary
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
think
it
could
be
stated
that
way.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
would
say
the
court
should
and
could
test
the
case
here
by
the
proper
standards.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
standards
which
the
statute
should
be
judged
by
are
those
declared
in
mcgowan,
mclaughlin
and
so
forth.
and
if
judged
by
those
standards,
i
think
there
are
conceivable
rational
basis
for
this
particular
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
those
are
sufficient,
yes
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
getting
back
just
a
moment
to
the
standard
which
should
be
applicable
here,
i
think
the
case
of
nestor
versus
flemming
is
the
closest
case
that
we
have
in
this
court
to
the
problem
presented
here.
we
discussed
and
rely
upon
in
our
brief
that's
relegated
to
a
footnote
in
the
appellee's
brief.
their
argument
is
that
that
was
decided
way
back
in
1960.
it's
per
se
now
it's
on
law.
you
can't
pay
any
attention
to
it
nowadays.
there's
too
much
happened
since
then.
flemming
versus
nestor
dealt
with
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act
which
cut
off
assistance
benefits
to
any
person
who
is
deported.
now,
the
fund
from
which
the
payments
were
made
there
was
one
into
which
the
applicant
had
paid
funds.
it's
unlike
the
situation
here
where
you
have
a
pure
fortuity,
the
person
had,
well
something
close
to
a
contractual
interest
in
these
funds.
the
court
nevertheless
said,
particularly
when
we
deal
with
a
withholding
of
a
non-contractual
benefit
under
a
social
welfare
program
such
as
this,
we
must
recognize
that
the
due
process
clause
can
be
thought
to
interpose
a
bar
only
if
the
statute
manifest
patently
arbitrary
classification,
utterly
lacking
in
rational
justification.
now,
that
is
the
standard
which
we
ask
the
court
to
apply
to
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
that
is
flemming
versus
nestor.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
on
the
case
of
washington
versus
legrant
which
defers
in
some
respect
from
the
other
two
cases.
in
that,
first,
it
involves
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
as
distinguished
from
a
state
legislative
act
and
at
least
insofar
as
connecticut
is
concerned.
the
district
of
columbia
statute
differs
considerably
and
that
it
imposes
a
one
year
residence
requirement
across
the
board
to
all
categories
without
respect
to
how
much
money
you
may
have
had
when
you
came
into
the
jurisdiction
or
any
other
contingent
provision.
the
question
presented
is
of
course
whether
or
not
the
provision
of
the
district
of
columbia
act
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
made
apical
in
the
district
of
columbia
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that
the
statute
makes
a
classification
is
clear.
it
distinguishes
between
those
who
have
been
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
one
year
and
those
who
have
not
insofar
as
eligibility
for
public
assistance
is
concerned.
the
question
is
of
course
whether
or
not
this
classification
is
an
invidious
classification
to
use
the
word
that
this
court
has
many
times
used.
now,
i
think
in
answering
that
question,
it
is
necessary
to
determine
by
what
standard
this
classification
is
to
be
judged
and
this
court
over
the
years
has
hammered
out
a
standard
and
what
i
would
call
an
exception
to
that
standard
or
if
you
like
possibly
two
standards.
the
first
standard
which
is
the
traditional
standard,
the
standard
which
is
applied
to
legislative
classifications
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
provides
that
the
legislative
enactment
is
presumed
to
be
constitutional,
that
legislatures
have
a
broad
scope
of
discretion
in
making
classifications
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
challenging
or
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
classification
to
show
that
the
classification
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
any
conceivable
legislative
purpose,
and
that
every
fact
or
reason
which
could
support
the
classification
will
be
presumed,
and
further
that
whether
or
not
any
of
these
conceivable
or
possible
legislative
purposes
that
may
underlie
the
statute
where
the
ones,
in
fact,
which
prompted
their
legislature
to
enact
the
statute
or
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
of
course,
constitutionally
irrelevant.
now,
the
second
standard
or
what
i
would
call
the
exception
to
the
general
standard
is
that
which
has
been
applied
in
cases
where
the
classification
directly
infringes
upon
a
preferred
freedom
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
where
the
classification
is
based
upon
race,
color
or
national
origin.
now
under
that
standard,
the
classification
is
immediately
suspect.
i
think
something
very
close
to
a
presumption
upon
constitutionality
arises
and
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
reason
for
that
classification.
and
even
when
the
government
can
show
a
compelling
reason,
the
statute
can
go
no
further
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
legislative
purpose.
now,
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
here
is
--
depends
upon
by
which
standard
the
district
of
columbia
public
assistance
act
of
1962
is
to
be
judged.if
by
the
first
standard,
i
think
it
is
clearly
constitutional.
if
by
the
second
standard,
then
it
is
probably
unconstitutional.
now,
that
the
court
below
applied
the
exceptional
standard,
the
standard
which
this
court
has
applied
to
first
amendment
freedom
cases
and
classifications
based
upon
race
is
clear,
i
think,
both
from
the
opinion
itself,
from
the
statutes
or
from
the
cases
upon
which
the
court
relies,
and
is
of
course
recognized
by
appellees.
indeed,
they
urge
strongly
upon
the
court
that
that
is
the
correct
standard
and
that
under
that
standard,
the
statute
is
still
constitutional.
although,
they
do
later
retreat
to
the
position
that
even
if
the
general
standard
is
the
proper
one,
it
is
unconstitutional.
now,
what
conceivable
legislative
purposes
underlie
this
particular
classification?
the
court
below
discussed
various
possibilities.
we
would
submit
that
there
are
at
least
three
which
would
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
classification.
not
that
these
are
the
only
ones
or
that
this
is
exhausted.
the
first
of
this
is
to
permit
the
local
government
to
plan
its
fiscal
affairs
on
a
year-to-year
basis.
now,
that
has
been
argued
already
before
you
at
some
length.
but
i
think
that
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose
which
would
support
the
constitutionality
of
this
classification.
i
might
say
that
i
asked
the
budget
director
of
the
district
of
columbia
department
of
public
welfare
to
prepare
some
figures
and
projections
as
to
how
the
injunction
under
which
the
welfare
authorities
have
been
since
the
latter
part
of
last
year
was
affecting
the
district
of
columbia's
welfare
program.
and
the
budget
director
took
the
figures
both
by
an
average
caseload
basis
and
by
the
monetary
sums
for
the
first
10
months
of
--
first
eight
months
rather
of
1968
and
compared
those
to
the
first
10
months
of
1967.
and
the
figures
reflect
an
increase
in
the
budget
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
about
a
110%,
substantially,
more
than
double.
now,
some
of
that
of
course
may
due
to
a
backlog
but
that's
the
abolition
of
this
classification
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
least
will
result
in
a
very
substantial
increase
in
the
budget
is
clear.
the
district
would
then
have
to
do
either
one
of
two
things.
it
would
have
to
increase
its
budget,
find
more
money
or
cut
down
the
amount
of
the
grants
to
the
individual
recipients.
now,
the
second
proper
legislative
purpose,
which
we
would
say
underlies
the
statute,
is
the
protection
of
--
and
--
of
fraud,
the
prevention
and
detection
of
fraud.
now,
the
appellees,
as
i
understand
them,
concede
that
the
prevention
and
detection
of
fraud
is
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
they
concede
further
that
the
one-year
residency
requirement
is
an
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose.
they
argue,
however,
that
it
is
not
a
particularly
effective
aid.
it
is
not
in
their
view,
at
least,
the
most
effective
or
best
means
of
protecting
fraud.
and
they
invoke
again
the
argument,
which
has
been
applied
by
this
court,
only
to
cases
within
the
exception.
and
that
is,
they
say
that
even
if
this
is
true,
a
proper
legislative
purpose
and
that
this
serves
that
purpose,
it
goes
beyond
what
is
absolutely
necessary
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
now,
that
standard
applies
only
to
the
exceptional
first
amendment
cases
and
we
submit
it
not
to
this
type
of
case.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i'm
not
sure
we
have
anything,
mr.
justice
marshall.
perhaps,
nine
months
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
perhaps
one
month
but
that
is
a
determination
which
the
legislature
has
to
make,
we
submit.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
it
is
--
the
well
is
not
bottomless.
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
in
legislating
for
the
district
of
columbia
acts
as
a
local
legislature.
it,
of
course,
acts
as
a
federal
legislature
otherwise.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
that
would
be
up
to
congress.
the
congress
could
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
ask
the
court
to
say
--
say
that.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
or
appropriate,
find
a
source
of
additional
funds.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
is.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
the
money
would
be,
of
course,
appropriated
by
the
congress
and
by
taxing
the
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
their
property.
there
are
two
sources
of
income
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
some
from
taxes,
some
from
grants
or
money
appropriated
by
the
congress.
the
third
proper
legislative
purpose,
which
we
would
say
could
underly
this
statute,
relates
to
the
residency.determination
of
what
is
residency
or
a
bona
fide
resident.
i
think
it
is
conceded
that
a
state
legislature
or
the
congress
of
the
united
states
acting
as
such
for
the
district
of
columbia
can
condition
public
assistance
grants
on
residency
that
is
provide
grants
only
to
bona
fide
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
distinguished
from
those
who
may
be
temporarily
sojourning
in
the
district
of
columbia
passing
through
visiting
friends,
relatives
and
so
forth
here
or
just
wondering
about
the
country.
now,
how
do
you
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
a
community?
with
a
normal
individual,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
or
things
that
you
could
look
to.
he
buys
a
house.
he
opens
a
bank
account.
he
opens
charge
accounts.
those,
of
course,
could
not
generally
be
applied
to
the
indigent.
all
he
would
generally
have
was
their
word
on
here
and
i
intend
to
remain
here
indefinitely.
but
by
the
very
nature
of
their
indigency,
they
come
here.
they
look
for
a
job.
if
they
don't
find
it,
they
move
on
to
another
city.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
it
does
some
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
--requirements.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
there
are
other
standards
that
can
be
worked
out
but
we
would
submit
that
the
congress
here
has
used
this
one-year
residency
provision
as
an
objective
legislative
test
for
determining
residency.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
--
i
think
they
were
--
they
are
overlapping.
you
would
have
to
determine,
of
course,
residence
and
then
the
duration
if
you
are
involved
in
the
one-year
requirement
here.
but
under
this
requirement,
the
intention
of
the
person
coming
here
is
immaterial.
you
may
have
come
here
to
get
higher
grants
for
anyone
of
a
thousand
things.
if
he
has
been
here
for
one
year,
regardless
of
why
he
came
here,
he
is
entitled
public
assistance.
if
he
has
not
been
here
one
year,
then
he
is
not.
it
saves
the
district
of
columbia
welfare
officials
the
many
difficult
problems
of
determining
who
is
a
bona
fide
resident.
now,
intent
is
one
of
the
elements
why
a
person
came
to
a
jurisdiction.
his
purpose
in
coming
there
is
another
factor.
does
he
intend
to
remain
there
indefinitely
or
permanently?
many
indigent
people
just
can't
say
that.
i'm
here
and
i
don't
know
how
long
i'm
going
to
be.
if
i
get
--
find
a
good
job,
i
may
stay
indefinitely.
if
i
don't,
i
may
move
on.
now,
to
avoid
the
difficulties
which
would
arise
from
trying
to
determine
each
of
these
cases
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
the
congress
just
says,
“here's
one
standard
regardless
of
all
else,
your
purpose,
your
intention,
anything
else,
if
you've
been
here
one
year,
that's
it.
you
are
a
bona
fide
resident.
if
you
haven't,
you
are
not.”
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
at
least,
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia
is
concerned,
as
i
understand
it
as
the
law
is
here
administered.
if
you
have
been
physically
present
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
one
year,
then
you
are
eligible
for
public
assistance.
regardless
of
whether
when
you
initially
came
here
or
came
to
visit
my
relatives,
i
intended
to
go
back
in
a
month
of
two
or
three
months.
i
came
here
for
any
other
temporary
purpose
and
later
decided
to
stay
on.
that's
not
used
at
all.
if
you're
physically
present
here
for
one
year,
that's
it.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
an
argument
which
has
been
advanced
by
necessity
by
the
appellees.
because,
only
if
the
court
accepts
their
argument
that
this
statute
does
infringe
upon
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel.
and
their
further
argument
that
--
that
the
right
to
travel
is
equivalent
or
in
the
same
class
as
the
first
amendment
preferred
right.
and
if
the
court
accepts
both
those
arguments,
then
the
exceptional
standard
in
judging
those
classifications,
constitutionality
would
apply
here.
and
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
it
would
probably
be
unconstitutional
under
that
standard.
now,
that
this
statute
incidentally
and
indirectly
may
discourage
travel
i
think
is
apparent.
but
it
is
our
position
that
it
does
not
arise
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
the
extent
of
the
infringement
upon
it.
there
is
no
direct
infringement.
this
court
has
dealt
with
a
right
to
travel,
of
course,
in
edwards
versus
california
and
the
various
passport
cases
and
the
guest
case
arising
in
georgia
and
so
forth.
but
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
a
direct
infringement
upon
the
right
to
travel
not
as
here
a
mere
discouragement.
but
let's
explore
for
a
minute
what
would
be
the
affect
of
holding
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
infringement
of
the
right
to
travel
where
you
have
state
a
that
has
a
very
low
grant,
where
you
have
state
b
that
has
a
very
generous
grant.
we
have
an
individual
in
state
b
that
wants
to
go
to
state
a.
i
am
discouraged
from
traveling
to
state
a
says
the
individual.
because
if
i
go
there,
the
grant
is
only
one-quarter,
one-fifth
of
what
i
am
receiving
in
this
state.
now,
would
that
then
mean
that
the
state
with
a
low
grant
would
be
constitutionally
required
to
up
its
grant
to
that
of
the
most
generous
state
because
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
grants
and
state
displayed
is
tremendous.
and
you
could
make
this
argument
just
as
effectively
between
the
amounts
of
assistance
granted
as
a
discouragement
to
travel,
perhaps
moreso
than
you
could
the
residence
a
requirement
because
the
residency
requirement
is
all
over
in
one
year.
the
grant
of
public
assistance
extends
indefinitely
as
long
as
you
are
in
need
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
is.
of
course,
the
holding
of
the
court
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
well,
this
is,
of
course,
federal
legislation
and
the
congress
can
put
burdens
upon
interstate
travel.
so
insofar
as
this
act
is
concerned
as
distinguished
in
the
state
acts,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
for
the
reason
that
the
court
found
that
california
statute
in
edwards
unconstitutional
as
improper
infringement
upon
interstate
commerce.
this
is
an
act
of
the
federal
legislature.
but
the
same
argument,
i
think,
could
be
applied
and
extended
insofar
as
interference
with
the
right
to
travel
by
differences
and
licensure
in
one
state.
here
i'm
a
plumber,
a
brick
player,
whatnot.
i'm
working
in
this
state.
i
want
to
travel
to
another
state.
it's
requirements
of
licensure
as
such
that
i
cannot
meet
it.
now,
that
would
discourage
me
from
traveling.
but
would
that
make
the
license
statute
of
the
other
state
unconstitutional?
i
might
say
just
a
word,
if
i
may,
about
the
applicability
of
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act
to
this
situation.
appellees
in
their
supplemental
brief
on
page
42
suggests
that
the
congress
in
enacting
this
provision,
which
of
course,
provides
for
federal
grants
to
state
programs
but
with
a
condition
limiting
the
residency
requirement
to
one
year.
they
say
that
the
congress
did
not
face
the
question
whether
any
period
of
residence
should
be
required.
now,
that's
just
plain
not
true.
when
the
congress
enacted
this,
it
knew.
and
in
fact,
this
was
urged
on
it
by
per
--
those
who
thought
residency
requirements
were
unwise.
you
can
handle
this
whole
problem
by
just
saying
you
don't
get
any
federal
grant
if
you
have
any
residency
requirement.
and
had
the
congress
seem
fit
to
do
that
that
would
have
effectively
abolished
residency
requirements.
because
while
in
theory,
a
state
could
still
operate
its
own
welfare
program
without
federal
grants,
it
would
almost
certainly
not
do
so
since
overall
the
federal
grants
make
up
about
57%
of
the
welfare
monies.
if
i
may
say
just
one
word
as
to
the
vera
barley
case
which
is
the
case
involving
the
lady
who
is
in
st.
elizabeth's
hospital
and
who
applied
for
public
assistance
and
even
though
she
had
been
there
for
years
and
years
under
a
regulation
of
the
department,
she
was
found
to
be
ineligible
because
they
would
not
permit
residency
in
a
public
institution
such
as
st.elizabeth's
to
be
counted.
now,
the
court
below
in
footnote
19
struck
down
that
regulation.
we
do
not
challenge
their
ruling
on
that.
so
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
case
here,
i
think,
as
far
as
vera
barley
is
concerned,
as
whether
or
not
the
one-year
residency
requirement
would
apply
to
her.
i
will
say
one
word
about
the
various
amici
briefs
that
had
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
position
here
and
remind
the
court
what
it
has
so
often
said
before
that
our
concern
here
is
with
power
and
not
with
wisdom.
i
think
that
bear
stressing
because
i
think
almost
the
entire
argument
in
the
amici
briefs
on
behalf
of
appellees
position
and
a
great
deal
of
the
argument
of
appellees
themselves
go
to
the
question
of
wisdom
and
not
power.
thank
you.
