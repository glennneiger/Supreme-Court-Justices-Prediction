mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice,
preliminarily
may
i
move
the
admission
of
mr.
thomas
gilhool,
counsel
for
appellee
in
this
case
pro
hac
vice
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
similar
to
the
other
two
which
this
court
has
already
heard
with
reference
to
the
residency
requirements
of
the
states
in
public
assistance
matters.
the
case
--
the
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
basically
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
may
i
preliminarily
point
out
to
this
court
as
has
been
indicated
previously
today
that
the
united
states
congress
and
the
legislatures
from
some
46
states
as
specifically
provided
for
residency
requirements
in
public
assistance
matters.
the
united
states
congress
in
the
legislation
which
enacted
the
social
security
law
allows
residency
requirement
to
be
enacted
by
the
states
of
up
to
one
year
in
duration.
relying
upon
that,
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
and
the
legislatures
of
some
45
other
states
have
determined
in
their
judgment
that
a
residency
requirement
is
proper
in
public
assistance
statute.
the
residency
requirement
in
pennsylvania,
applies
to
all
types
of
public
assistance
and
welfare
benefits
with
the
following
exceptions
and
i
believe
that
these
exceptions
are
important.
first
of
all,
under
the
recently
enacted
medical
assistance
program,
the
united
states
congress
has
provided
that
there
shall
be
no
residency
requirement
and
therefore
under
the
medical
assistance
program
in
pennsylvania,
pennsylvania
does
not
have
a
residency
requirement.
likewise,
pennsylvania
does
not
have
a
residency
requirement
with
reference
to
children
who
may
receive
aid
and
this
is
in
the
record
from
county
state
reimbursement,
children
who
are
dependent,
neglected
or
delinquent
and
those
children
for
example
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have
--
plaintiffs
will
happen
to
be
the
minor
children,
the
court
have
received
assistance
in
pennsylvania
through
the
county
board
of
assistance
in
philadelphia
without
any
residency
requirement.
likewise,
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have
received
medical
assistance
in
pennsylvania
under
both
the
federal
and
state
program.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
if
it's
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
there
are
--
first
of
all,
under
pennsylvania
assistance
regulations,
pennsylvania
has
entered
into
reciprocal
agreements
with
some
18
other
states
which
would
allow
us
to
provide
benefits
for
people
from
those
other
states
who
are
not
residents
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
with
reference
to
those,
we
will
make
arrangements
for
immediate
payments
to
them
in
order
to
allow
them
to
return
to
where
they
have
come
from,
plane
tickets
or
subsidence
while
they
remain
in
pennsylvania
subject
of
course
to
their
leaving
under
the
arrangements
which
the
department
of
public
welfare
will
make
for
them.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
in
the
event
that
they
don't
of
course
don't
want
to
leave,
they
do
run
a
file
of
the
residency
requirement
although
the
counties
in
pennsylvania,
individual
counties
of
course
would
have
the
ability
to
provide
benefits
for
them
in
county
homes
because
the
primary
responsibility
is
on
the
county.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
if
they're
physically
unable
to
go
home,
i
believe
they
would
qualify
for
medical
assistance
and
would
be
able
to
be
sustained
under
that
particular
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
also
would
wish
to
make
the
argument
which
has
been
made
here
today
that
the
standard
which
this
court
must
apply
in
this
particular
type
of
case
is
a
standard
which
the
court
has
set
forth
in
the
mcgowan
opinion
and
that
is
that
unless
the
classification
is
entirely
unreasonable,
entirely
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
shall
be
sustained.
now,
i
believe
there
are
sufficient
reasons
and
justifications
for
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
to
enact
the
statute
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
they
would
be
these.
first
of
all,
and
of
course
the
standard
is
under
any
set
of
circumstances
or
foreseeable
facts,
is
this
type
of
distinction
reasonable?
i
believe
that
the
purposes
which
the
general
assembly
would
have
in
enacting
this
type
of
legislation
and
which
this
court
could
find
would
first
of
all
be
the
fiscal
purpose
and
that
is
to
preserve
in
a
general
way
the
soundness
of
the
program
against
unforeseen
events
not
and
i
do
not
admit
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
or
the
purpose
of
our
public
assistance
policy
in
pennsylvania
is
to
keep
indigents
out
of
pennsylvania
because
first
of
all,
they
can
travel
in
as
they
have
in
this
particular
case.
secondly,
they
can
receive
other
benefits
as
i
have
described
to
this
court
and
also,
because
pennsylvania
has
entered
into
the
type
of
reciprocal
arrangements
with
some
18
other
states
to
provide
benefits
for
them.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
it's
not
welfare
payments
per
se
but
its
residence.
it
would
be
food
that
would
be
other
necessities
like
that,
clothing
and
shelter.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
it
used
to
be
called
for
houses,
they're
not
classified
as
being
county
homes
and
of
course
pennsylvania
has
a
modern
program
in
that
particular
respect.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
general
assembly
in
determining
that
it
will
maintain
a
sound
--
a
fiscally
sound
program
can
in
its
judgment
and
in
its
wisdom
protect
against
unforeseen
events
which
would
put
a
great
mass
or
people
into
pennsylvania
at
any
particular
time
for
whatever
purpose
and
they
would
then
become
--
they
would
then
be
available
for
this
public
assistance
benefits,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
suppose
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
suppose
a
natural
disaster
were
to
strike
a
neighboring
city
or
neighboring
--
a
city
and
neighboring
state
and
a
million
of
people
have
to
come
in
to
pennsylvania.
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
the
paramount
responsibility
would
be
on
the
federal
government
and
not
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
provide.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
but
if
this
type
of
legislation
that
is
struck
down
in
pennsylvania
would
be
called
upon
to
provide
that
type
of
relief.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
would
hope
they
would
not
be
excused
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
but
nevertheless,
the
responsibility
would
be
there
for
pennsylvania
to
do
this.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
think
any
type
of
disaster
or
for
other
reason
that
a
great
number
of
people
would
move
from
one
place
to
another
and
i
think
that
there
can
be
many
but
that's
only
the
first
reason
which
i
base
the
--
in
which
i
think
that
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
have
seen
fit
to
pass
this
type
of
statute.
the
second
is
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
you
mean
to
county
assistance?
mr.
william
c.
sennett
as
far
as
our
county
assistance
program?
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
50%
basically.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
it
does
that
because
of
the
consideration
which
the
federal
government
has
to
see
that
the
states
do
adopt
this
type
of
a
program
to
care
for
residence
of
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
every
state
that
has
a
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
basically,
all
of
them
i
believe
have
them.
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
believe
it
did.
the
second
justification
or
reason
behind
this
type
of
a
residency
requirement
is
that
it
serves
a
predictive
purpose
as
the
opinion
of
judge
colodner
in
a
companion
case
wagner
versus
rosen
which
is
another
three-judge
court
in
pennsylvania
and
that
opinion
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
statute.
judge
colodner
wrote
that
this
type
of
a
statute
is
necessary
because
it
serves
a
predictive
purpose.
in
other
words,
pennsylvania
as
to
all
of
the
states
operate
on
rather
strict
budgets
we
have
in
pennsylvania
a
budget
to
upright
the
state
government
of
approximately
$2
billion.
of
that
$2
billion,
some
$200
million
are
paid
in
welfare
in
this
type
of
payment,
assistance
payments.
now
certainly,
the
general
assembly
in
limiting
it
to
residents
who
have
been
there
within
a
year
has
a
genuine
concern
about
the
budget
under
which
the
general
assembly
must
operate
and
these
payments
must
be
made
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
so
that
the
statute
does
serve
a
predictive
purpose
to
that
extent.
thirdly,
as
a
policy
decision
i
submit.
as
a
policy
decision,
a
state
can
require
participation
in
the
community
prior
to
its
dispensing
welfare
programs
because
we
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
or
any
state
does
not
have
to
set
up
a
welfare
program.
and
i
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
general
assembly
can
require
participation
in
the
state
prior
to
dispensing
welfare
benefits.
of
course
in
pennsylvania
we
have
a
great
many
residency
requirements.
we
do
not
allow
for
example
county
officers
to
become
country
officers
unless
they
have
been
a
resident
for
one
year
prior
to
an
appointment.
we
do
not
allow
citizens
to
vote
in
pennsylvania
unless
they
have
been
a
resident
for
90
days.
we
do
not
allow
a
citizen
to
maintain
or
commence
a
divorced
action
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
unless
he
has
been
a
resident
for
one
year
preceding
the
petition.
and
we
have
other
similar
type
of
residency
requirements,
compensation
and
pension
of
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
90
days.
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
at
least
one
month
resided
in
the
state
90
days
and
in
the
election
district
for
60
days.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
this,
that
it
is
a
matter
for
the
general
assembly,
for
the
legislature
to
determine
as
to
what
the
length
of
residency
should
be
in
all
of
these
various
available
programs
for
benefits.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
a
voter
is
and
that's
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
time
is
only
90
days
in
pennsylvania
where
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
of
course,
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
general
assembly
has
determined.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
all
three
cases
are
basically
similar.and
i
see
no
need
to
review
them
at
this
time.
and
likewise,
counsel
have,
i
believe,
have
set
forth
the
legitimate
legislative
purposes
which
the
states
have
in
--
in
which
the
federal
congress
has
in
establishing
residency
requirements.
what
i
do
think
is
extremely
important
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislatures
of
some
40
states
together
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
determined
that
residency
requirements
are
lawful
in
welfare
situations.
and
i
would
review
what
this
court
just
briefly
the
types
of
requirements
in
the
various
welfare
statutes
that
congress
has
passed.
our
own,
of
course,
the
one
at
issue
here,
42
u.s.c.
402,
is
grants
to
states
for
aid
and
services
to
needy
families
with
children
which
was
first
enacted
with
the
residency
requirement
in
1935
and
thereafter
amended
many
times
without
deleting
the
residency
requirement
until
1962
through
1962.
in
addition
to
that
in
42
u.s.c
1202,
the
congress
has
provided
for
aid
to
the
blind,
originally
passed
in
1935
with
amendments
through
1964
and
a
residency
requirement
again
of
one
year
and
five
of
nine
years.
in
1935,
the
congress
passed
aid
to
permanently
and
totally
disabled.
it
was
amended
through
1965,
the
same
residency
requirements
appear,
five
of
nine
and
one
year
immediately
preceding.
in
42
u.s.c.
1382,
the
congress
enacted
aid
to
aged,
blind,
disabled,
and
a
medical
assistance
program
for
the
aged.
again,
a
residency
requirement
was
provided
five
of
nine
years,
one
year
preceding.
in
42
u.s.c.
302,
the
congress
provided
for
old
age
assistance
and
medical
assistance
to
the
aged.
it
originally
provided
for
five
of
nine
years
and
one
year
preceding.
and
then
in
1960,
with
reference
to
medical
assistance
for
the
aged,
the
congress
eliminated
the
one-year
residency
require
--
requirement.
and
later
in
1965
when
the
congress
passed
the
medical
assistance
program,
again,
the
congress
eliminated
the
residency
requirement
by
providing
that
the
states
could
not
have
any
residency
requirement
either
for
the
medical
assistance
program
or
for
the
old
age
assistance
program
to
the
aged.
i
believe
that
that
is
extremely
important
in
a
context
of
this
present
case
because
not
only
the
states,
not
only
the
legislatures
of
the
40
states
who
have
such
a
program
but
also
the
congress
has
determined
that
a
residency
requirement
is
a
valid
requirement
in
establishing
this
program
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
question.
but
that,
if
--
if
this
court
is
going
to
strike
down
the
residency
requirements
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
states
statutes,
it
also
has
to
face
very
clearly,
very
specifically
the
problem
raised
since
the
congress
in
enacting
section
402
has
also
provided,
required
the
legislative
--
the
--
the
administrator
to
accept
the
program
with
a
residency
requirement
therein.
now,
if
the
residency
requirement
is
unlawful,
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned,
this
court
then
also
has
to
say
that
the
federal
act
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
with
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
problem
and
whether
or
not
the
discrimination
in
this
particular
type
of
requirement
is
invidious,
i
believe
the
case
has
clearly
set
forth
the
area
in
which
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
can
go.
starting
with
mcgowan
versus
maryland,
this
court
determined
that
certain
sunday
closing
laws
in
the
state
of
maryland
although
they
were
discriminatory,
again,
certain
types
of
stores
were
nevertheless
lawful.
because
this
court
said
that
when
it
comes
to
a
consideration
of
the
equal
protection
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
states
are
allowed
a
wide
scope
of
discretion
in
enacting
laws
which
affect
some
group
of
citizens
differently
than
others
and
that
the
constitutional
safeguards
are
offended
only
if
the
classification
rest
on
grounds
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
achievement
of
the
state's
objective.
the
state
legislatures
are
presumed
to
have
acted
within
their
constitutional
power
despite
the
fact
that
their
laws
result
in
some
inequality
and
a
statutory
discrimination
will
not
be
set
aside
if
any
state
of
facts
reasonably
may
be
conceived
to
justify.
now,
mcgowan
was
followed
and
preceded
by
a
number
of
cases
both
in
this
court
and
in
some
of
the
circuit
courts
which
have
also
upheld
discriminatory
estate
statutes
in
various
areas
where
the
discrimination
was
not
invidious.
for
example,
in
drueding
versus
devlin,
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
maryland
residency
requirement
with
reference
to
voters
of
one
year
in
the
state
and
six
months
in
the
county
was
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
allied
stores
versus
bowers
in
1959,
this
court
held
that
an
ohio
tax
on
property
and
a
warehouse,
which
exempted
a
non-resident,
was
not
invidious
discrimination
since
the
state
was
presumed
to
have
acted
on
a
rational
basis
in
setting
up
its
tax
statutes.
in
carrington
versus
rash,
which
was
again
a
voting
case,
this
court
in
1965
when
considering
a
texas
statute
with
reference
to
residency
requirement
of
military
said,
“you
cannot
discriminate
--
you
cannot
discriminate
between
residents,
one
who
are
in
the
military
and
one
who
are
not
in
the
military,
but
you
certainly
can
establish
a
residency
requirement
for
voting.”
and
likewise
back
in
1948,
this
court
in
336
u.s.
railway
express
versus
new
york
in
considering
a
new
york
city
traffic
regulation
which
actually
forbid
advertising
on
trucks
other
than
that
of
the
owner
said
that
such
a
regulation
was
such
discrimination
was
not
invidious.
and
finally,
of
course,
in
flemming
versus
nestor
in
363
u.s.
603,
this
court
actually
considered
a
question
involving
old
age
survivorship
and
disability
insurance
benefits.and
there,
the
congress
had
not
just
established
a
residency
requirement.
there
the
congress
had
actually
taken
away
the
benefits
from
an
alien
who
became
eligible
in
1955
and
was
deported
in
1956
and
as
a
result
of
his
deportation,
benefits
were
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
the
residency
requirement
for
voting
in
pennsylvania
--
no,
that's
not
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
is
a
year
as
far
as
moving
from
out
of
the
state
into
the
state,
from
county-to-county
in
the
state
every
60
days.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
believe
so.
it
is
a
year
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
--
of
moving
outside
of
the
state
into
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
in
flemming
versus
nestor,
this
court
determined
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
that
particular
situation
where
the
congress
had
actually
taken
away
this
type
of
assistance
from
an
alien
who
was
deported.
and
this
court
established
that
there
are
many
different
requirements
in
the
social
security
act
that
there
are
no
accrued
property
rights
in
the
system,
and
that
congress
may
modify
the
statutory
scheme
so
long
as
congress
does
not
act
arbitrarily
and
so
long
as
a
due
process
is
not
offended.
i
think
it
is
not
worthy
that
to
indicate
that
even
in
the
dissent
in
flemming
versus
nestor,
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
clear
indication
in
specific
language
that
congress
could
limit
benefits
to
residents.
now,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
also
consider
with
the
court
briefly,
the
effect
of
the
congressional
of
congress
legislating
in
this
particular
type
of
case
and
establishing
a
residency
requirement
the
--
and
i
submit
that
following
this
court's
decision
in
bolling
versus
sharpe
which
affected
the
segregation
in
schools
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
followed
brown
versus
the
board
of
education,
that
in
that
case
this
court
declared
unconstitutional,
of
course,
the
segregated
school
case
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
at
the
same
time,
this
court
says
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
contain
an
equal
protection
clause
and
that
this
--
and
that
the
concepts
are
not
necessarily
the
same,
that
equal
protection
is
a
more
explicit
safeguard
of
prohibited
unfairness
than
due
process
of
law,
and
that
therefore,
we
do
not
imply
that
the
two
are
always
interchangeable,
but
as
this
court
has
recognized,
discrimination
may
become
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violative
of
due
process.
now,
as
--
as
counsel
from
the
district
of
columbia
has
indicated,
this
court
has
clearly
seen
that
there
is
a
double
standard
when
it
comes
to
the
type
of
discrimination
which
the
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
may
make
depending
upon
the
type
of
right
that
is
involved
because
bolling
versus
sharpe
was
clearly
a
discrimination
based
on
race
and
this
court
will
not
tolerate
discriminations
based
upon
that
particular
ground.
the
court's
opinion
in
bolling
versus
sharpe
refers
back
to
such
cases
as
detroit
bank
versus
the
united
states
where
a
federal
tax
statute
was
discriminatory
and
that
it
applied
to
one
type
of
property
and
not
to
the
other
but
nevertheless
was
upheld,
and
likewise,
to
currin
versus
wallace,
1939
supreme
court
case,
where
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
while
it
was
subject
to
fifth
amendment
principles,
nevertheless,
could
be
discriminatory.
so
that
i
think
when
we
consider
the
basis
on
which
this
court
must
consider
the
act
of
congress
which
is
here
in
question.
and
i
do
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
an
act
of
congress
in
addition
to
an
act
of
the
state
legislature
here
at
issue.
and
in
considering
the
act
of
congress,
the
court
will
consider
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
contain
an
equal
protection
clause.
and
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
not
always
interchangeable.
and
even
though
discriminatory
federal
action
may
be
so
unjustifiable
to
be
violative
of
fifth
amendment
due
process,
the
test
so
far
as
the
federal
action
is
concerned,
is
whether
the
alleged
discriminatory
feature
is
reasonably
related
to
any
proper
governmental
objective.
now
here,
the
proper
governmental
objective
which
the
congress
determined
was
to
have
a
program
in
which
the
states
would
participate.
the
congress
in
all
of
the
residency
requirements
so
fit
to
encourage
the
states
to
establish
programs
within
the
limit
set
forth
by
the
congress.
that
is
a
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no.
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
what
the
congress
did
here
was
a
--
a
--
was
to
establish
a
program
which
is
--
which
is
in
itself
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
encouraged
the
states
to
participate
in
that
program
after
first
having
established
the
standards.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
here,
the
legitimate
legislative
purpose
was
to
have
the
states
provide
this
type
of
programs.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
have
the
states
participate.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
that
violates
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no,
that
violates
the
--
the
article
1
privilege
and
--
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
discriminatory.
but
here
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
that
i've
been
able
to
find
that
type
of
case,
but
i
think
that
certainly
it
is
realistic
to
consider
in
this
case
that
here
the
congress
was
looking
at
all
of
the
different
state
statutes
and
all
of
the
different
residency
requirements.
some
of
which
went
up
as
high
as
15
and
20
years
in
different
types
of
programs.and
here
they
said,
“now
in
order
to
get
this
uniform,
we
will
establish
a
residency
requirement
of
one
year,
and
thereby
encourage
all
the
states
to
come
in
and
all
the
states
have
40,
at
least
forty
of
the
states
have
responded
to
the
congress
and
adapted
this
type
of
--
of
program.”
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
so.
as
my
position
that
congress
has
mandated
in
section
402
of
the
act
the
one-year
residency
requirement
and
in
order
to
strike
down
the
residency
requirement,
this
court
not
only
has
to
strike
down
the
--
the
statutes
of
the
various
states
but
also
in
section
402
of
the
social
security.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
some
states
do
not
have
residency
requirement.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
it
--
it
mandated
that
at
the
very
least
there
could
be
a
one-year
residency
requirement
and
if
this
court
says
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
--
that's
exactly
right.
but
if
this
court
strikes
down
the
residency
requirement,
it
will
be
telling
the
congress
that
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
residency
requirement.
and
of
course,
as
we
argued
at
some
length
in
the
last
argument
almost
all
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
in
the
lengthy
briefs
of
appellees
in
this
case
about
the
terrible
situation
of
this
particular
plaintiffs
and
that
they
are
not
able
to
obtain
care
and
so
on,
those
arguments
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress,
that
congress
in
providing
medical
assistance
has
seemed
to
not
to
adapt
the
residency
requirement,
that
congress
in
providing
other
types
of
welfare
has
seemed
to
not
to
adapt
the
residency
requirement.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
congress
or
other
states
such
as
new
york
already
has,
might
in
the
future
determine
that
they
will
not
have
a
residency
requirement.
but
i
submit
that
it
is
the
congress
which
makes
that
determination
and
the
state
legislation.
and
so
long
as
there
is
a
valid
purpose
and
the
purpose
here
clearly,
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned
has
been
explained,
as
far
as
the
congress
is
concerned,
is
to
establish
a
program
in
which
the
states
will
work
that
this
court
will
not
strike
down
either
the
state
statutes
or
the
congressional
determination.
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
understand
correctly
the
entire
meaning
and
scope
of
the
argument
which
has
been
presented
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case,
it
is
to
end
finally
and
completely
for
all
purposes
really,
residency
as
a
distinction
capacity
whereby
the
states
can
determine
who
can
and
who
cannot
qualify
in
certain
areas.
and
i
think
that
what
has
been
suggested
to
this
court
is
that
residency,
for
purposes
perhaps
of
voting,
residency
as
a
condition
before
a
person
may
file
a
complaint
for
divorce,
residency
as
a
condition
and
whereby,
certain
students
pay
tuition
to
public
schools,
universities
and
certain
do
not,
perhaps
even
residency
requirements
to
the
extent
that
a
state
has
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
who
is
going
to
be
a
hunter
and
who
can
operate
an
automobile
in
the
state
or
to
be
now
ended
because
that
certainly
is
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
argument
which
has
here
been
presented.
and
it
does
i
suggest
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right
and
durational
residency
has
been
and
historic
basis
whereby,
the
states
have
been
able
to
determine
who
can
and
who
cannot
participate
in
the
extent
that
they
can
participate
in
activities
within
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
law
as
the
federal
statute
suggests
that
there
is
residency
and
there
also
is
a
year
requirement.
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
suppose
if
under
certain
circumstances,
it
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
it
will
determine
that
you
were
not
a
resident.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
certainly,
the
administrators
of
the
federal
and
the
estate
programs
would
be
justified
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
a
person
who
had
been
there
a
year,
almost
in
all
circumstances
that
was
a
resident
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
would
qualify.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
if
that
person
has
not
resided
within
the
commonwealth
for
a
year,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
that
the
primary
purpose
for
which
the
law
was
passed
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
argument
which
has
been
presented
by
the
appellee
has
not
mentioned
at
all,
actually.
what
is
the
purpose?
what
--
what
was
the
legislative
purpose
for
enacting
these
welfare
statutes
in
the
first
place?
was
the
legislative
purpose
simply
to
give
out
money?
and
it
is
not.
the
legislative
purpose
as
it's
spelled
out
in
the
pennsylvania
law
is
of
course
to
encourage
self-respect,
self-dependency
and
the
desire
to
motivate
the
individual
to
be
a
good
and
useful
citizen
in
society.
it
is
to
encourage
him
to
go
work
and
not
simply
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that
is
the
judgment
which
both
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
the
states
have
made
that
one
year
is
an
adequate
time
in
order
to
determine
this
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
think
that
i
would
l
admit
that
that
is
the
primary
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
primary
purpose
is
what
i
have
just
indicated
that
the
legislature
has
determined
that
there
should
be
this
welfare
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
purpose
is
to
encourage
the
individual
who
comes
into
pennsylvania
to
be
a
citizen
and
contribute
to
the
society
of
the
state,
to
contribute
to
the
economy
of
the
state
and
to
become
a
permanent
part
of
that
state's
economy
and
social
life.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
that
--
that
is
what
the
legislature
has
determined.
now
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
admitted
that
the
state's
apparently
could
adopt
the
past
legislation
which
would
allow
them
a
reasonable
time
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
resident.
reasonable
time
--
what
is
a
reasonable
time?
is
this
court
now
going
to
say
that
a
state
could
have
a
reasonable
time
to
determine
residency?
and
that
that
reasonable
time
might
be
three
or
four
months
but
not
one
year
in
the
face
of
the
almost
unanimous
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
40
states
and
of
the
congress
that
one
year
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
what
i
was
saying
is
that
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
admitted
apparently
that
the
states
should
have
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
resident
and
they
admit
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
unreasonable,
capricious
and
arbitrary
for
the
states
to
say,
“because
a
person
hasn't
been
in
a
year,
that
welfare
--
that
these
payments
can
be
denied.”
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
inconsistent
position
and
that
inconsistency
should
not
be
the
basis
for
this
court's
determination
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
indicating
to
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
--
that's
exactly
right.
the
only
reason
that
i'm
mentioning
that
is
to
show
that
in
my
judgment,
it
is
inconsistent
on
the
one
hand,
this
side
of
the
state
should
have
a
reasonable
time
and
on
the
other
hand
to
say
that
a
one
year
is
completely
arbitration
or
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
--
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
states
do
have
a
legitimate
purpose
in
encouraging
people
to
participate
in
the
community
and
certainly,
the
legislatures
have
--
in
furthering
that
determined
that
an
individual
should
be
in
the
society
for
a
year
in
order
to
fulfill
that
particular
purpose.
that
is
a
purpose,
in
my
judgment,
which
goes
beyond
the
other
purposes
which
have
been
mentioned
here
today.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
through
the
--
through
the
general
appropriation
raising
measures.
it's
a
part
of
the
general
budget
or
welfare
which
money
is
raised
for
the
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
we
have
no
income
tax
in
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
--pennsylvania.
we
have
a
general
sales
tax,
a
corporate
income
tax
and
a
state
tax,
but
this
is
a
part
of
the
general
fund
budget
which
is
raised
in
the
general
revenue
raising
measures
in
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
on
a
year
by
year
basis.
one
year
at
a
time,
our
budget
is
for
one
year
at
a
time
only.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
it
is
--
the
amount
is
fixed,
for
example
for
the
fiscal
year
which
will
begin
july
1,
1969,
the
amount
will
be
fixed
by
the
general
assembly
in
the
early
part
of
1969
when
it
approves
the
budget
submitted
by
the
governor.
it
generally
runs
a
month
or
so
or
maybe
two
to
three
months
ahead
of
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year,
not
a
very
long
time.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
or
people
who
own
a
property
within
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
payable
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
payable
currently,
payable
in
the
year.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
since
we
don't
have
a

mr.
william
c.
sennett
property
tax
is
payable
at
different
times
throughout
the
year,
depending
upon
the
counties
in
which
you
reside.
there's
no
estate
or
real
property
tax
as
such.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no
real
property
tax.
personal
property,
corporate
income
tax
payable,
of
course,
in
the
year
in
which
the
budget
is
determined.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
--
the
corporate
income
tax
is
due
quarterly.
it's
paid
quarterly
the
same
as
federal
income
tax
returns,
paid
quarterly.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
in
advance.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
might
i
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
order
to
strike
down
the
statutory
determination
of
the
legislatures
in
these
cases.
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
as
i
indicated
to
strike
down
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act
and
i
refer
the
court
to
simkins
versus
moses
cone
memorial
hospital
in
which
the
circuit
court,
this
court
denied
sir,
in
which
the
circuit
court
had
under
consideration
stayed
regulations
in
a
federal
statute.
and
the
federal
statute
had
to
do
with
the
providing
by
the
federal
government
of
hill-burton
funds
for
hospitals
in
the
states.
and
the
federal
statute,
together
with
the
state
statute
and
the
regulations,
authorized
separate
but
equal
hospital
services
and
the
court
declared
the
federal
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
citing
bolling
versus
sharpe
and
the
course
declared
the
state
statute
and
regulations
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
again,
that
was
a
discrimination
case
based
upon
race.
and
i
mentioned
the
case
because
i
submit
it
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
where
we
have
as
in
this
case,
a
federal
statute
which
directly
authorizes
residency
requirements,
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
this
court,
not
only
to
strike
down
the
legislation
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
but
also
of
the
federal
congress.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
figures
--
the
last
figures
that
i
saw
mr.
justice
marshall,
where
the
40
states
have
residency
requirements.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
i
believe
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
certainly
if
a
state
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
say
that
a
state
cannot
have
a
residency
requirement
without
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
pennsylvania
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
our
judgment
is
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
certainly
prohibits
as
does
the
federal
statute
certainly
prohibits
granting
of
welfare
under
these
circumstances
--
if
the
residency
requirements
are
not
met.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no,
our
position
is
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
because
the
federal
statute
specifically
authorizes
pennsylvania
to
have
a
residency
requirement
and
moreover,
it
requires
the
administrator
to
accept
a
program
in
which
a
residency
requirement
is
included
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
requires
them
to
disperse
money.
now
certainly,
if
a
residency
requirement
is
not
to
be
allowed,
the
court
has
to
meet
the
mandate
of
that
statute
because
the
administrator
no
longer
can
do
what
he
is
now
required
to
do
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
of
course,
there
is
no
escaping
the
federal
statute
when
it
comes
to
the
district
of
columbia
case
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
congress
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
has
manifested
its
intention
to
--
has
clearly
authorized
residency
requirement
in
the
district
of
columbia
case.
these
two
statutes
are
therefore
analogous
in
my
judgment.
the
social
security
statute,
402,
carries
that
the
same
provision
into
effect
for
all
of
the
legislatures
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
it's
our
position
that
if
the
congress
has
spoken
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
all
of
the
states
in
this
manner,
that
the
court
cannot
escape
coming
to
grips
with
the
federal
statute
just
by
saying
that
the
states
have
done
something
wrong.
the
states
have
only
done
what
the
congress
has
said
they
could
do
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
because
i
think
the
standard
is
different
between
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
that,
first
of
all
this
court
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
that's
correct
justice
white
and
i
think
you
can
make
that
but
i
also
think
that
it
is
a
support
to
our
case
to
say
that
for
this
court,
first
of
all,
this
court
historically
has
said
it
will
give
greater
deference
to
acts
of
the
congress.
and
secondly,
i
think
that
test
as
to
discrimination
rises
higher
in
a
fifth
amendment
situation
than
it
does
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
finally,
it
just
let
me
say
that
as
we
point
out
in
the
very
last
two
pages
of
our
brief
that
the
logical
result
of
what
appellees
asked
this
court
to
do
is
to
end
all
type
of
discrimination
and
all
of
type
of
welfare
statutes.
remember,
all
of
the
statutes
that
we
mentioned
yesterday
with
regard
to
all
types
of
welfare
programs
have
residency
requirements
therein.
in
addition,
is
this
court
now
prepared
to
establish
that
welfare
really
is
a
right
and
that
in
making
a
program
to
carry
out
the
distribution
of
that
right
to
citizens
that
there
can
be
no
discrimination
at
all
that
persons
under
65
who
are
not
blind
or
disabled,
who
do
not
belong
in
families
with
dependent
children,
but
are
frequently
in
dire
need
must
--
the
states
now
provide
a
welfare
for
them?
what
is
the
result
of
ending
this
type
of
discrimination
and
i
suggest
that
the
entire
welfare
program
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
states
and
the
federal
congress
does
have
discrimination
included
therein.
we
don't
give
welfare
except
if
you
happen
to
meet
the
particular
requirements,
if
you
happen
to
be
blind
or
disabled
or
over
65,
but
what
about
the
people
who
are
not?
is
this
court
now
prepared
to
say
that
the
welfare
right
must
be
extended
to
everyone
without
any
discrimination
whatsoever?
i
don't
that
the
court
has
ever
gone
that
far.
i'm
sure
it
hasn't
and
i
suggest
it
will
do
so
in
this
case.
and
finally,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
katzenbach
versus
the
morgan
in
which
this
court
upheld
section
4(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
struck
down
the
new
york
statute.
but
at
the
same
time
admitted
that
section
4(e)
which
referred
to
american
flag
schools
was
in
itself
discriminatory,
nevertheless,
a
valid
exercise
of
legislative
prerogative.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
it
rest
on
both
grounds.
in
other
words,
we
have
spelled
out
that
one
of
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
a
budgetary
requirement
that
limited
resources
are
available
and
these
can
only
be
distributed,
should
only
be
distributed
in
a
certain
way
that
that
is
a
legitimate
purpose,
that
the
budgetary
requirements
of
the
commonwealth,
in
order
for
us
to
determine
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
available
for
welfare.
that
is
also
legitimate
purpose.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice,
preliminarily
may
i
move
the
admission
of
mr.
thomas
gilhool,
counsel
for
appellee
in
this
case
pro
hac
vice
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
similar
to
the
other
two
which
this
court
has
already
heard
with
reference
to
the
residency
requirements
of
the
states
in
public
assistance
matters.
the
case
--
the
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
basically
similar
to
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
may
i
preliminarily
point
out
to
this
court
as
has
been
indicated
previously
today
that
the
united
states
congress
and
the
legislatures
from
some
46
states
as
specifically
provided
for
residency
requirements
in
public
assistance
matters.
the
united
states
congress
in
the
legislation
which
enacted
the
social
security
law
allows
residency
requirement
to
be
enacted
by
the
states
of
up
to
one
year
in
duration.
relying
upon
that,
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
and
the
legislatures
of
some
45
other
states
have
determined
in
their
judgment
that
a
residency
requirement
is
proper
in
public
assistance
statute.
the
residency
requirement
in
pennsylvania,
applies
to
all
types
of
public
assistance
and
welfare
benefits
with
the
following
exceptions
and
i
believe
that
these
exceptions
are
important.
first
of
all,
under
the
recently
enacted
medical
assistance
program,
the
united
states
congress
has
provided
that
there
shall
be
no
residency
requirement
and
therefore
under
the
medical
assistance
program
in
pennsylvania,
pennsylvania
does
not
have
a
residency
requirement.
likewise,
pennsylvania
does
not
have
a
residency
requirement
with
reference
to
children
who
may
receive
aid
and
this
is
in
the
record
from
county
state
reimbursement,
children
who
are
dependent,
neglected
or
delinquent
and
those
children
for
example
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have
--
plaintiffs
will
happen
to
be
the
minor
children,
the
court
have
received
assistance
in
pennsylvania
through
the
county
board
of
assistance
in
philadelphia
without
any
residency
requirement.
likewise,
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have
received
medical
assistance
in
pennsylvania
under
both
the
federal
and
state
program.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
if
it's
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
there
are
--
first
of
all,
under
pennsylvania
assistance
regulations,
pennsylvania
has
entered
into
reciprocal
agreements
with
some
18
other
states
which
would
allow
us
to
provide
benefits
for
people
from
those
other
states
who
are
not
residents
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
with
reference
to
those,
we
will
make
arrangements
for
immediate
payments
to
them
in
order
to
allow
them
to
return
to
where
they
have
come
from,
plane
tickets
or
subsidence
while
they
remain
in
pennsylvania
subject
of
course
to
their
leaving
under
the
arrangements
which
the
department
of
public
welfare
will
make
for
them.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
in
the
event
that
they
don't
of
course
don't
want
to
leave,
they
do
run
a
file
of
the
residency
requirement
although
the
counties
in
pennsylvania,
individual
counties
of
course
would
have
the
ability
to
provide
benefits
for
them
in
county
homes
because
the
primary
responsibility
is
on
the
county.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
if
they're
physically
unable
to
go
home,
i
believe
they
would
qualify
for
medical
assistance
and
would
be
able
to
be
sustained
under
that
particular
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
also
would
wish
to
make
the
argument
which
has
been
made
here
today
that
the
standard
which
this
court
must
apply
in
this
particular
type
of
case
is
a
standard
which
the
court
has
set
forth
in
the
mcgowan
opinion
and
that
is
that
unless
the
classification
is
entirely
unreasonable,
entirely
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
shall
be
sustained.
now,
i
believe
there
are
sufficient
reasons
and
justifications
for
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
to
enact
the
statute
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
they
would
be
these.
first
of
all,
and
of
course
the
standard
is
under
any
set
of
circumstances
or
foreseeable
facts,
is
this
type
of
distinction
reasonable?
i
believe
that
the
purposes
which
the
general
assembly
would
have
in
enacting
this
type
of
legislation
and
which
this
court
could
find
would
first
of
all
be
the
fiscal
purpose
and
that
is
to
preserve
in
a
general
way
the
soundness
of
the
program
against
unforeseen
events
not
and
i
do
not
admit
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
or
the
purpose
of
our
public
assistance
policy
in
pennsylvania
is
to
keep
indigents
out
of
pennsylvania
because
first
of
all,
they
can
travel
in
as
they
have
in
this
particular
case.
secondly,
they
can
receive
other
benefits
as
i
have
described
to
this
court
and
also,
because
pennsylvania
has
entered
into
the
type
of
reciprocal
arrangements
with
some
18
other
states
to
provide
benefits
for
them.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
it's
not
welfare
payments
per
se
but
its
residence.
it
would
be
food
that
would
be
other
necessities
like
that,
clothing
and
shelter.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
it
used
to
be
called
for
houses,
they're
not
classified
as
being
county
homes
and
of
course
pennsylvania
has
a
modern
program
in
that
particular
respect.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
general
assembly
in
determining
that
it
will
maintain
a
sound
--
a
fiscally
sound
program
can
in
its
judgment
and
in
its
wisdom
protect
against
unforeseen
events
which
would
put
a
great
mass
or
people
into
pennsylvania
at
any
particular
time
for
whatever
purpose
and
they
would
then
become
--
they
would
then
be
available
for
this
public
assistance
benefits,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
suppose
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
suppose
a
natural
disaster
were
to
strike
a
neighboring
city
or
neighboring
--
a
city
and
neighboring
state
and
a
million
of
people
have
to
come
in
to
pennsylvania.
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
the
paramount
responsibility
would
be
on
the
federal
government
and
not
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
provide.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
but
if
this
type
of
legislation
that
is
struck
down
in
pennsylvania
would
be
called
upon
to
provide
that
type
of
relief.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
would
hope
they
would
not
be
excused
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
but
nevertheless,
the
responsibility
would
be
there
for
pennsylvania
to
do
this.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
think
any
type
of
disaster
or
for
other
reason
that
a
great
number
of
people
would
move
from
one
place
to
another
and
i
think
that
there
can
be
many
but
that's
only
the
first
reason
which
i
base
the
--
in
which
i
think
that
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
have
seen
fit
to
pass
this
type
of
statute.
the
second
is
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
you
mean
to
county
assistance?
mr.
william
c.
sennett
as
far
as
our
county
assistance
program?
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
50%
basically.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
it
does
that
because
of
the
consideration
which
the
federal
government
has
to
see
that
the
states
do
adopt
this
type
of
a
program
to
care
for
residence
of
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
every
state
that
has
a
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
basically,
all
of
them
i
believe
have
them.
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
believe
it
did.
the
second
justification
or
reason
behind
this
type
of
a
residency
requirement
is
that
it
serves
a
predictive
purpose
as
the
opinion
of
judge
colodner
in
a
companion
case
wagner
versus
rosen
which
is
another
three-judge
court
in
pennsylvania
and
that
opinion
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
statute.
judge
colodner
wrote
that
this
type
of
a
statute
is
necessary
because
it
serves
a
predictive
purpose.
in
other
words,
pennsylvania
as
to
all
of
the
states
operate
on
rather
strict
budgets
we
have
in
pennsylvania
a
budget
to
upright
the
state
government
of
approximately
$2
billion.
of
that
$2
billion,
some
$200
million
are
paid
in
welfare
in
this
type
of
payment,
assistance
payments.
now
certainly,
the
general
assembly
in
limiting
it
to
residents
who
have
been
there
within
a
year
has
a
genuine
concern
about
the
budget
under
which
the
general
assembly
must
operate
and
these
payments
must
be
made
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
so
that
the
statute
does
serve
a
predictive
purpose
to
that
extent.
thirdly,
as
a
policy
decision
i
submit.
as
a
policy
decision,
a
state
can
require
participation
in
the
community
prior
to
its
dispensing
welfare
programs
because
we
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
or
any
state
does
not
have
to
set
up
a
welfare
program.
and
i
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
general
assembly
can
require
participation
in
the
state
prior
to
dispensing
welfare
benefits.
of
course
in
pennsylvania
we
have
a
great
many
residency
requirements.
we
do
not
allow
for
example
county
officers
to
become
country
officers
unless
they
have
been
a
resident
for
one
year
prior
to
an
appointment.
we
do
not
allow
citizens
to
vote
in
pennsylvania
unless
they
have
been
a
resident
for
90
days.
we
do
not
allow
a
citizen
to
maintain
or
commence
a
divorced
action
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
unless
he
has
been
a
resident
for
one
year
preceding
the
petition.
and
we
have
other
similar
type
of
residency
requirements,
compensation
and
pension
of
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
90
days.
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
at
least
one
month
resided
in
the
state
90
days
and
in
the
election
district
for
60
days.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
this,
that
it
is
a
matter
for
the
general
assembly,
for
the
legislature
to
determine
as
to
what
the
length
of
residency
should
be
in
all
of
these
various
available
programs
for
benefits.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
a
voter
is
and
that's
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
time
is
only
90
days
in
pennsylvania
where
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
of
course,
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
general
assembly
has
determined.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
all
three
cases
are
basically
similar.and
i
see
no
need
to
review
them
at
this
time.
and
likewise,
counsel
have,
i
believe,
have
set
forth
the
legitimate
legislative
purposes
which
the
states
have
in
--
in
which
the
federal
congress
has
in
establishing
residency
requirements.
what
i
do
think
is
extremely
important
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislatures
of
some
40
states
together
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
determined
that
residency
requirements
are
lawful
in
welfare
situations.
and
i
would
review
what
this
court
just
briefly
the
types
of
requirements
in
the
various
welfare
statutes
that
congress
has
passed.
our
own,
of
course,
the
one
at
issue
here,
42
u.s.c.
402,
is
grants
to
states
for
aid
and
services
to
needy
families
with
children
which
was
first
enacted
with
the
residency
requirement
in
1935
and
thereafter
amended
many
times
without
deleting
the
residency
requirement
until
1962
through
1962.
in
addition
to
that
in
42
u.s.c
1202,
the
congress
has
provided
for
aid
to
the
blind,
originally
passed
in
1935
with
amendments
through
1964
and
a
residency
requirement
again
of
one
year
and
five
of
nine
years.
in
1935,
the
congress
passed
aid
to
permanently
and
totally
disabled.
it
was
amended
through
1965,
the
same
residency
requirements
appear,
five
of
nine
and
one
year
immediately
preceding.
in
42
u.s.c.
1382,
the
congress
enacted
aid
to
aged,
blind,
disabled,
and
a
medical
assistance
program
for
the
aged.
again,
a
residency
requirement
was
provided
five
of
nine
years,
one
year
preceding.
in
42
u.s.c.
302,
the
congress
provided
for
old
age
assistance
and
medical
assistance
to
the
aged.
it
originally
provided
for
five
of
nine
years
and
one
year
preceding.
and
then
in
1960,
with
reference
to
medical
assistance
for
the
aged,
the
congress
eliminated
the
one-year
residency
require
--
requirement.
and
later
in
1965
when
the
congress
passed
the
medical
assistance
program,
again,
the
congress
eliminated
the
residency
requirement
by
providing
that
the
states
could
not
have
any
residency
requirement
either
for
the
medical
assistance
program
or
for
the
old
age
assistance
program
to
the
aged.
i
believe
that
that
is
extremely
important
in
a
context
of
this
present
case
because
not
only
the
states,
not
only
the
legislatures
of
the
40
states
who
have
such
a
program
but
also
the
congress
has
determined
that
a
residency
requirement
is
a
valid
requirement
in
establishing
this
program
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
question.
but
that,
if
--
if
this
court
is
going
to
strike
down
the
residency
requirements
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
states
statutes,
it
also
has
to
face
very
clearly,
very
specifically
the
problem
raised
since
the
congress
in
enacting
section
402
has
also
provided,
required
the
legislative
--
the
--
the
administrator
to
accept
the
program
with
a
residency
requirement
therein.
now,
if
the
residency
requirement
is
unlawful,
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned,
this
court
then
also
has
to
say
that
the
federal
act
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
with
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
problem
and
whether
or
not
the
discrimination
in
this
particular
type
of
requirement
is
invidious,
i
believe
the
case
has
clearly
set
forth
the
area
in
which
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
can
go.
starting
with
mcgowan
versus
maryland,
this
court
determined
that
certain
sunday
closing
laws
in
the
state
of
maryland
although
they
were
discriminatory,
again,
certain
types
of
stores
were
nevertheless
lawful.
because
this
court
said
that
when
it
comes
to
a
consideration
of
the
equal
protection
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
states
are
allowed
a
wide
scope
of
discretion
in
enacting
laws
which
affect
some
group
of
citizens
differently
than
others
and
that
the
constitutional
safeguards
are
offended
only
if
the
classification
rest
on
grounds
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
achievement
of
the
state's
objective.
the
state
legislatures
are
presumed
to
have
acted
within
their
constitutional
power
despite
the
fact
that
their
laws
result
in
some
inequality
and
a
statutory
discrimination
will
not
be
set
aside
if
any
state
of
facts
reasonably
may
be
conceived
to
justify.
now,
mcgowan
was
followed
and
preceded
by
a
number
of
cases
both
in
this
court
and
in
some
of
the
circuit
courts
which
have
also
upheld
discriminatory
estate
statutes
in
various
areas
where
the
discrimination
was
not
invidious.
for
example,
in
drueding
versus
devlin,
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
maryland
residency
requirement
with
reference
to
voters
of
one
year
in
the
state
and
six
months
in
the
county
was
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
allied
stores
versus
bowers
in
1959,
this
court
held
that
an
ohio
tax
on
property
and
a
warehouse,
which
exempted
a
non-resident,
was
not
invidious
discrimination
since
the
state
was
presumed
to
have
acted
on
a
rational
basis
in
setting
up
its
tax
statutes.
in
carrington
versus
rash,
which
was
again
a
voting
case,
this
court
in
1965
when
considering
a
texas
statute
with
reference
to
residency
requirement
of
military
said,
“you
cannot
discriminate
--
you
cannot
discriminate
between
residents,
one
who
are
in
the
military
and
one
who
are
not
in
the
military,
but
you
certainly
can
establish
a
residency
requirement
for
voting.”
and
likewise
back
in
1948,
this
court
in
336
u.s.
railway
express
versus
new
york
in
considering
a
new
york
city
traffic
regulation
which
actually
forbid
advertising
on
trucks
other
than
that
of
the
owner
said
that
such
a
regulation
was
such
discrimination
was
not
invidious.
and
finally,
of
course,
in
flemming
versus
nestor
in
363
u.s.
603,
this
court
actually
considered
a
question
involving
old
age
survivorship
and
disability
insurance
benefits.and
there,
the
congress
had
not
just
established
a
residency
requirement.
there
the
congress
had
actually
taken
away
the
benefits
from
an
alien
who
became
eligible
in
1955
and
was
deported
in
1956
and
as
a
result
of
his
deportation,
benefits
were
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
the
residency
requirement
for
voting
in
pennsylvania
--
no,
that's
not
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
is
a
year
as
far
as
moving
from
out
of
the
state
into
the
state,
from
county-to-county
in
the
state
every
60
days.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
believe
so.
it
is
a
year
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
--
of
moving
outside
of
the
state
into
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
in
flemming
versus
nestor,
this
court
determined
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
that
particular
situation
where
the
congress
had
actually
taken
away
this
type
of
assistance
from
an
alien
who
was
deported.
and
this
court
established
that
there
are
many
different
requirements
in
the
social
security
act
that
there
are
no
accrued
property
rights
in
the
system,
and
that
congress
may
modify
the
statutory
scheme
so
long
as
congress
does
not
act
arbitrarily
and
so
long
as
a
due
process
is
not
offended.
i
think
it
is
not
worthy
that
to
indicate
that
even
in
the
dissent
in
flemming
versus
nestor,
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
clear
indication
in
specific
language
that
congress
could
limit
benefits
to
residents.
now,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
also
consider
with
the
court
briefly,
the
effect
of
the
congressional
of
congress
legislating
in
this
particular
type
of
case
and
establishing
a
residency
requirement
the
--
and
i
submit
that
following
this
court's
decision
in
bolling
versus
sharpe
which
affected
the
segregation
in
schools
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
followed
brown
versus
the
board
of
education,
that
in
that
case
this
court
declared
unconstitutional,
of
course,
the
segregated
school
case
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
at
the
same
time,
this
court
says
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
contain
an
equal
protection
clause
and
that
this
--
and
that
the
concepts
are
not
necessarily
the
same,
that
equal
protection
is
a
more
explicit
safeguard
of
prohibited
unfairness
than
due
process
of
law,
and
that
therefore,
we
do
not
imply
that
the
two
are
always
interchangeable,
but
as
this
court
has
recognized,
discrimination
may
become
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violative
of
due
process.
now,
as
--
as
counsel
from
the
district
of
columbia
has
indicated,
this
court
has
clearly
seen
that
there
is
a
double
standard
when
it
comes
to
the
type
of
discrimination
which
the
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
may
make
depending
upon
the
type
of
right
that
is
involved
because
bolling
versus
sharpe
was
clearly
a
discrimination
based
on
race
and
this
court
will
not
tolerate
discriminations
based
upon
that
particular
ground.
the
court's
opinion
in
bolling
versus
sharpe
refers
back
to
such
cases
as
detroit
bank
versus
the
united
states
where
a
federal
tax
statute
was
discriminatory
and
that
it
applied
to
one
type
of
property
and
not
to
the
other
but
nevertheless
was
upheld,
and
likewise,
to
currin
versus
wallace,
1939
supreme
court
case,
where
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
while
it
was
subject
to
fifth
amendment
principles,
nevertheless,
could
be
discriminatory.
so
that
i
think
when
we
consider
the
basis
on
which
this
court
must
consider
the
act
of
congress
which
is
here
in
question.
and
i
do
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
an
act
of
congress
in
addition
to
an
act
of
the
state
legislature
here
at
issue.
and
in
considering
the
act
of
congress,
the
court
will
consider
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
contain
an
equal
protection
clause.
and
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
not
always
interchangeable.
and
even
though
discriminatory
federal
action
may
be
so
unjustifiable
to
be
violative
of
fifth
amendment
due
process,
the
test
so
far
as
the
federal
action
is
concerned,
is
whether
the
alleged
discriminatory
feature
is
reasonably
related
to
any
proper
governmental
objective.
now
here,
the
proper
governmental
objective
which
the
congress
determined
was
to
have
a
program
in
which
the
states
would
participate.
the
congress
in
all
of
the
residency
requirements
so
fit
to
encourage
the
states
to
establish
programs
within
the
limit
set
forth
by
the
congress.
that
is
a
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no.
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
what
the
congress
did
here
was
a
--
a
--
was
to
establish
a
program
which
is
--
which
is
in
itself
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
encouraged
the
states
to
participate
in
that
program
after
first
having
established
the
standards.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
here,
the
legitimate
legislative
purpose
was
to
have
the
states
provide
this
type
of
programs.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
have
the
states
participate.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
that
violates
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no,
that
violates
the
--
the
article
1
privilege
and
--
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
discriminatory.
but
here
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
that
i've
been
able
to
find
that
type
of
case,
but
i
think
that
certainly
it
is
realistic
to
consider
in
this
case
that
here
the
congress
was
looking
at
all
of
the
different
state
statutes
and
all
of
the
different
residency
requirements.
some
of
which
went
up
as
high
as
15
and
20
years
in
different
types
of
programs.and
here
they
said,
“now
in
order
to
get
this
uniform,
we
will
establish
a
residency
requirement
of
one
year,
and
thereby
encourage
all
the
states
to
come
in
and
all
the
states
have
40,
at
least
forty
of
the
states
have
responded
to
the
congress
and
adapted
this
type
of
--
of
program.”
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
so.
as
my
position
that
congress
has
mandated
in
section
402
of
the
act
the
one-year
residency
requirement
and
in
order
to
strike
down
the
residency
requirement,
this
court
not
only
has
to
strike
down
the
--
the
statutes
of
the
various
states
but
also
in
section
402
of
the
social
security.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
some
states
do
not
have
residency
requirement.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
it
--
it
mandated
that
at
the
very
least
there
could
be
a
one-year
residency
requirement
and
if
this
court
says
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
--
that's
exactly
right.
but
if
this
court
strikes
down
the
residency
requirement,
it
will
be
telling
the
congress
that
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
residency
requirement.
and
of
course,
as
we
argued
at
some
length
in
the
last
argument
almost
all
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
in
the
lengthy
briefs
of
appellees
in
this
case
about
the
terrible
situation
of
this
particular
plaintiffs
and
that
they
are
not
able
to
obtain
care
and
so
on,
those
arguments
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress,
that
congress
in
providing
medical
assistance
has
seemed
to
not
to
adapt
the
residency
requirement,
that
congress
in
providing
other
types
of
welfare
has
seemed
to
not
to
adapt
the
residency
requirement.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
congress
or
other
states
such
as
new
york
already
has,
might
in
the
future
determine
that
they
will
not
have
a
residency
requirement.
but
i
submit
that
it
is
the
congress
which
makes
that
determination
and
the
state
legislation.
and
so
long
as
there
is
a
valid
purpose
and
the
purpose
here
clearly,
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned
has
been
explained,
as
far
as
the
congress
is
concerned,
is
to
establish
a
program
in
which
the
states
will
work
that
this
court
will
not
strike
down
either
the
state
statutes
or
the
congressional
determination.
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
understand
correctly
the
entire
meaning
and
scope
of
the
argument
which
has
been
presented
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case,
it
is
to
end
finally
and
completely
for
all
purposes
really,
residency
as
a
distinction
capacity
whereby
the
states
can
determine
who
can
and
who
cannot
qualify
in
certain
areas.
and
i
think
that
what
has
been
suggested
to
this
court
is
that
residency,
for
purposes
perhaps
of
voting,
residency
as
a
condition
before
a
person
may
file
a
complaint
for
divorce,
residency
as
a
condition
and
whereby,
certain
students
pay
tuition
to
public
schools,
universities
and
certain
do
not,
perhaps
even
residency
requirements
to
the
extent
that
a
state
has
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
who
is
going
to
be
a
hunter
and
who
can
operate
an
automobile
in
the
state
or
to
be
now
ended
because
that
certainly
is
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
argument
which
has
here
been
presented.
and
it
does
i
suggest
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right
and
durational
residency
has
been
and
historic
basis
whereby,
the
states
have
been
able
to
determine
who
can
and
who
cannot
participate
in
the
extent
that
they
can
participate
in
activities
within
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
law
as
the
federal
statute
suggests
that
there
is
residency
and
there
also
is
a
year
requirement.
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
suppose
if
under
certain
circumstances,
it
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
it
will
determine
that
you
were
not
a
resident.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
certainly,
the
administrators
of
the
federal
and
the
estate
programs
would
be
justified
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
a
person
who
had
been
there
a
year,
almost
in
all
circumstances
that
was
a
resident
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
would
qualify.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
if
that
person
has
not
resided
within
the
commonwealth
for
a
year,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
that
that
the
primary
purpose
for
which
the
law
was
passed
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
argument
which
has
been
presented
by
the
appellee
has
not
mentioned
at
all,
actually.
what
is
the
purpose?
what
--
what
was
the
legislative
purpose
for
enacting
these
welfare
statutes
in
the
first
place?
was
the
legislative
purpose
simply
to
give
out
money?
and
it
is
not.
the
legislative
purpose
as
it's
spelled
out
in
the
pennsylvania
law
is
of
course
to
encourage
self-respect,
self-dependency
and
the
desire
to
motivate
the
individual
to
be
a
good
and
useful
citizen
in
society.
it
is
to
encourage
him
to
go
work
and
not
simply
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that
is
the
judgment
which
both
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
the
states
have
made
that
one
year
is
an
adequate
time
in
order
to
determine
this
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
don't
think
that
i
would
l
admit
that
that
is
the
primary
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
primary
purpose
is
what
i
have
just
indicated
that
the
legislature
has
determined
that
there
should
be
this
welfare
program.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
purpose
is
to
encourage
the
individual
who
comes
into
pennsylvania
to
be
a
citizen
and
contribute
to
the
society
of
the
state,
to
contribute
to
the
economy
of
the
state
and
to
become
a
permanent
part
of
that
state's
economy
and
social
life.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
that
--
that
is
what
the
legislature
has
determined.
now
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
admitted
that
the
state's
apparently
could
adopt
the
past
legislation
which
would
allow
them
a
reasonable
time
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
resident.
reasonable
time
--
what
is
a
reasonable
time?
is
this
court
now
going
to
say
that
a
state
could
have
a
reasonable
time
to
determine
residency?
and
that
that
reasonable
time
might
be
three
or
four
months
but
not
one
year
in
the
face
of
the
almost
unanimous
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
40
states
and
of
the
congress
that
one
year
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
what
i
was
saying
is
that
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
admitted
apparently
that
the
states
should
have
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
resident
and
they
admit
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
unreasonable,
capricious
and
arbitrary
for
the
states
to
say,
“because
a
person
hasn't
been
in
a
year,
that
welfare
--
that
these
payments
can
be
denied.”
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
inconsistent
position
and
that
inconsistency
should
not
be
the
basis
for
this
court's
determination
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
indicating
to
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
--
that's
exactly
right.
the
only
reason
that
i'm
mentioning
that
is
to
show
that
in
my
judgment,
it
is
inconsistent
on
the
one
hand,
this
side
of
the
state
should
have
a
reasonable
time
and
on
the
other
hand
to
say
that
a
one
year
is
completely
arbitration
or
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
--
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
states
do
have
a
legitimate
purpose
in
encouraging
people
to
participate
in
the
community
and
certainly,
the
legislatures
have
--
in
furthering
that
determined
that
an
individual
should
be
in
the
society
for
a
year
in
order
to
fulfill
that
particular
purpose.
that
is
a
purpose,
in
my
judgment,
which
goes
beyond
the
other
purposes
which
have
been
mentioned
here
today.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
through
the
--
through
the
general
appropriation
raising
measures.
it's
a
part
of
the
general
budget
or
welfare
which
money
is
raised
for
the
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
we
have
no
income
tax
in
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
--pennsylvania.
we
have
a
general
sales
tax,
a
corporate
income
tax
and
a
state
tax,
but
this
is
a
part
of
the
general
fund
budget
which
is
raised
in
the
general
revenue
raising
measures
in
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
on
a
year
by
year
basis.
one
year
at
a
time,
our
budget
is
for
one
year
at
a
time
only.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
it
is
--
the
amount
is
fixed,
for
example
for
the
fiscal
year
which
will
begin
july
1,
1969,
the
amount
will
be
fixed
by
the
general
assembly
in
the
early
part
of
1969
when
it
approves
the
budget
submitted
by
the
governor.
it
generally
runs
a
month
or
so
or
maybe
two
to
three
months
ahead
of
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year,
not
a
very
long
time.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
or
people
who
own
a
property
within
the
state.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
payable
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
payable
currently,
payable
in
the
year.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well,
since
we
don't
have
a
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
property
tax
is
payable
at
different
times
throughout
the
year,
depending
upon
the
counties
in
which
you
reside.
there's
no
estate
or
real
property
tax
as
such.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no
real
property
tax.
personal
property,
corporate
income
tax
payable,
of
course,
in
the
year
in
which
the
budget
is
determined.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
--
the
corporate
income
tax
is
due
quarterly.
it's
paid
quarterly
the
same
as
federal
income
tax
returns,
paid
quarterly.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
in
advance.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes.
might
i
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
order
to
strike
down
the
statutory
determination
of
the
legislatures
in
these
cases.
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
as
i
indicated
to
strike
down
section
402(b)
of
the
social
security
act
and
i
refer
the
court
to
simkins
versus
moses
cone
memorial
hospital
in
which
the
circuit
court,
this
court
denied
sir,
in
which
the
circuit
court
had
under
consideration
stayed
regulations
in
a
federal
statute.
and
the
federal
statute
had
to
do
with
the
providing
by
the
federal
government
of
hill-burton
funds
for
hospitals
in
the
states.
and
the
federal
statute,
together
with
the
state
statute
and
the
regulations,
authorized
separate
but
equal
hospital
services
and
the
court
declared
the
federal
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
citing
bolling
versus
sharpe
and
the
course
declared
the
state
statute
and
regulations
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
again,
that
was
a
discrimination
case
based
upon
race.
and
i
mentioned
the
case
because
i
submit
it
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
where
we
have
as
in
this
case,
a
federal
statute
which
directly
authorizes
residency
requirements,
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
this
court,
not
only
to
strike
down
the
legislation
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
but
also
of
the
federal
congress.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
the
figures
--
the
last
figures
that
i
saw
mr.
justice
marshall,
where
the
40
states
have
residency
requirements.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
i
believe
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
certainly
if
a
state
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
oh,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
say
that
a
state
cannot
have
a
residency
requirement
without
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
pennsylvania
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
our
judgment
is
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
certainly
prohibits
as
does
the
federal
statute
certainly
prohibits
granting
of
welfare
under
these
circumstances
--
if
the
residency
requirements
are
not
met.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
no,
our
position
is
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
because
the
federal
statute
specifically
authorizes
pennsylvania
to
have
a
residency
requirement
and
moreover,
it
requires
the
administrator
to
accept
a
program
in
which
a
residency
requirement
is
included
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
and
requires
them
to
disperse
money.
now
certainly,
if
a
residency
requirement
is
not
to
be
allowed,
the
court
has
to
meet
the
mandate
of
that
statute
because
the
administrator
no
longer
can
do
what
he
is
now
required
to
do
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
of
course,
there
is
no
escaping
the
federal
statute
when
it
comes
to
the
district
of
columbia
case
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
congress
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
has
manifested
its
intention
to
--
has
clearly
authorized
residency
requirement
in
the
district
of
columbia
case.
these
two
statutes
are
therefore
analogous
in
my
judgment.
the
social
security
statute,
402,
carries
that
the
same
provision
into
effect
for
all
of
the
legislatures
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
it's
our
position
that
if
the
congress
has
spoken
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
all
of
the
states
in
this
manner,
that
the
court
cannot
escape
coming
to
grips
with
the
federal
statute
just
by
saying
that
the
states
have
done
something
wrong.
the
states
have
only
done
what
the
congress
has
said
they
could
do
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
because
i
think
the
standard
is
different
between
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
that,
first
of
all
this
court
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
well
--
mr.
william
c.
sennett
yes,
that's
correct
justice
white
and
i
think
you
can
make
that
but
i
also
think
that
it
is
a
support
to
our
case
to
say
that
for
this
court,
first
of
all,
this
court
historically
has
said
it
will
give
greater
deference
to
acts
of
the
congress.
and
secondly,
i
think
that
test
as
to
discrimination
rises
higher
in
a
fifth
amendment
situation
than
it
does
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
finally,
it
just
let
me
say
that
as
we
point
out
in
the
very
last
two
pages
of
our
brief
that
the
logical
result
of
what
appellees
asked
this
court
to
do
is
to
end
all
type
of
discrimination
and
all
of
type
of
welfare
statutes.
remember,
all
of
the
statutes
that
we
mentioned
yesterday
with
regard
to
all
types
of
welfare
programs
have
residency
requirements
therein.
in
addition,
is
this
court
now
prepared
to
establish
that
welfare
really
is
a
right
and
that
in
making
a
program
to
carry
out
the
distribution
of
that
right
to
citizens
that
there
can
be
no
discrimination
at
all
that
persons
under
65
who
are
not
blind
or
disabled,
who
do
not
belong
in
families
with
dependent
children,
but
are
frequently
in
dire
need
must
--
the
states
now
provide
a
welfare
for
them?
what
is
the
result
of
ending
this
type
of
discrimination
and
i
suggest
that
the
entire
welfare
program
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
states
and
the
federal
congress
does
have
discrimination
included
therein.
we
don't
give
welfare
except
if
you
happen
to
meet
the
particular
requirements,
if
you
happen
to
be
blind
or
disabled
or
over
65,
but
what
about
the
people
who
are
not?
is
this
court
now
prepared
to
say
that
the
welfare
right
must
be
extended
to
everyone
without
any
discrimination
whatsoever?
i
don't
that
the
court
has
ever
gone
that
far.
i'm
sure
it
hasn't
and
i
suggest
it
will
do
so
in
this
case.
and
finally,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
katzenbach
versus
the
morgan
in
which
this
court
upheld
section
4(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
struck
down
the
new
york
statute.
but
at
the
same
time
admitted
that
section
4(e)
which
referred
to
american
flag
schools
was
in
itself
discriminatory,
nevertheless,
a
valid
exercise
of
legislative
prerogative.
mr.
william
c.
sennett
i
think
it
rest
on
both
grounds.
in
other
words,
we
have
spelled
out
that
one
of
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
a
budgetary
requirement
that
limited
resources
are
available
and
these
can
only
be
distributed,
should
only
be
distributed
in
a
certain
way
that
that
is
a
legitimate
purpose,
that
the
budgetary
requirements
of
the
commonwealth,
in
order
for
us
to
determine
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
available
for
welfare.
that
is
also
legitimate
purpose.
thank
you.
