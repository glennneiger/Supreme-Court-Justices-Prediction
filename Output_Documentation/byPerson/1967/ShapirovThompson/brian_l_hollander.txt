mr.
brian
l.
hollander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
just
take
a
brief
moment
before
i
address
myself
to
the
case
at
hand
just
to
answer
the
arguments
made
by
the
married
counsel
from
iowa.
firstly,
as
i
understand
her
argument,
she
would
define
residents
somehow
differently
than
the
law
defines
it.
she
would
expect
that
a
person
would
have
to
be
--
establish
something
more
than
presence
in
the
state
and
does
intend
to
remain
in
the
state.
she
would
expect
that
a
person
would
have
to
somehow
have
a
burden
of
proving
that
she
really
wanted
to
be
a
member
of
the
community
of
that
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well
i
think
even
as
to
domicile
at
least
in
connecticut,
domicile
is
defined
the
same
way
as
resident
presence
and
intention
and
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
don't
think
that
if
the
court
upholds
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
then
in
anyway
interferes
with
the
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
you
have
to
be
a
resident
for
six
months
not
one
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
don't
think
that
connecticut
defines
resident
as
a
person
who
is
in
the
state
for
six
months.
connecticut
just
says
you
have
to
be
in
the
state
for
six
months
before
you
can
vote.
it's
somewhat
similar
to
the
duration
of
residence
law
and
issued
before
the
court.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
the
state
has
a
valid
purpose
in
the
support
of
that
law,
the
voting
law
and
i
don't
think
it's
put
in
issue
by
the
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
that
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
as
the
court
has
said
in
--
as
it
has
been
said
recently,
a
district
court
case
which
was
not
reviewed
by
this
court,
there
is
a
problem
of
potential
fraud
in
voting
and
also,
there
is
the
requirement
that
a
person
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts
so
that
they
can
cast
their
vote
in
a
reasonable
way
and
the
objectives
of
an
election
can
be
accomplished.
i
think
that
that
is
reasonable.
i
don't
think
that
--
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
the
whole
--
this
law
unconstitutional
in
anyway,
affects
the
constitutionality
of
that
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
did
you
say
that
it
would
not
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
because
massachusetts
at
this
time
--
at
that
time,
massachusetts
also
had
a
similar
residence
law.
so
for
purposes
of
receiving
public
assistance,
if
she
could
not
receive
assistance
in
connecticut
at
least
as
to
those
other
states
that
have
residence
requirements,
she
could
not
receive
assistance
there
and
specifically,
massachusetts
from
--
the
state
from
which
she
had
come?
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
one
year.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
connecticut
has
no
provision
like
iowa
has
with
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no.
i
personally
don't
know
of
any
other
states
that
do
another
--
maybe.
i
just
don't
know
that
--
on
the
ground
that
the
action
taken
by
the
state
welfare
department
was
illegally
--
we
requested
if
their
hearing
--
their
hearing
was
held
on
the
ground
that
she
had
not
met
the
residence
requirement
and
relief
was
denied.
the
three-judge
court
panel
was
compelled
and
the
action
was
brought
before
the
district
court.
now,
during
the
period
of
time
from
the
denial
of
benefits
by
the
state
of
connecticut
and
the
termination
of
benefits
from
the
hartford
department
of
public
welfare,
the
appellee
was
supported
by
private
agents
in
connecticut,
catholic
family
services.
now,
catholic
family
services
voluntarily
provided
assistance
at
a
level
below
the
level
that
the
appellee
would
have
received
from
the
state
of
connecticut
for
approximately
23
weeks.
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
that
it's
in
the
transcript,
the
part
of
the
unprinted
record
from
the
district
court
that
the
commission
of
welfare
in
connecticut
states
quite
clearly
that
this
is
a
unique
situation
that
private
charities
cannot
be
called
upon
to
render
this
type
of
assistance
today.
they
just
do
not
have
the
funds
to
do
this.
it
was
at
the
request
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
situation
that
the
private
charity
did
this.
now,
connecticut
has
a
basic
welfare
statute
which
is
17-85
which
provides
that
any
relative
having
a
dependent
child
who
is
unable
to
furnish
suitable
support
therefore
in
his
own
home
shall
be
eligible
to
receive
afdc.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
child
gets
the
benefits
derivatively
through
the
parent.
a
parent
must
apply.
the
child
has
no
status
to
apply
individually.
now,
this
means
that
if
you
turn
to
section
17-2d
that
even
though
a
person
is
without
--
is
unable
to
furnish
suitable
support
for
the
dependent
child
that
that
person
will
not
receive
assistance
for
the
period
of
the
duration
of
residence
law.
now,
on
its
phase,
section
17-2d
makes
ineligible
those
new
residents
who
arrive
in
the
state
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future.
now,
as
this
statute
has
come
to
be
administered,
pursuant
to
regulations
drafted
by
the
commission
of
welfare
and
these
regulations
are
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
in
the
printed
appendix,
benefits
are
denied
all
new
residents
in
connecticut
for
a
period
of
three
months
regardless
of
under
what
circumstances
they
have
to
the
stay
for
three
months,
they
are
denied
with
benefits.
now,
after
the
three-month
period
is
up,
the
person
who
enters
the
state
either
with
a
job
or
with
sufficient
personal
resources
to
have
supported
himself
and
his
family
for
a
period
of
three
months
is
then
eligible
to
receive
assistance.
now,
for
the
purposes
of
defining
resources,
the
state
excludes
moneys
which
come
from
relatives,
friends,
public,
private
or
voluntary
agencies.
so
what
it
boils
down
to
is
a
person
who
comes
into
the
state
and
has
saved
some
money
and
has
enough
money
saved
to
support
themselves
and
the
family
for
a
period
of
three
months
or
comes
into
the
state
with
the
job
that
that
person
is
eligible
for
assistance
after
three
months
have
elapsed.
as
to
all
other
persons,
they're
ineligible
for
one
year.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
this
applies
to
--
pursuant
to
the
statute
applies
to
afdc
and
to
what
they
call
general
assistance
which
is
the
temporary
assistance
program
administered
by
the
local
units.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
other
welfare
programs
applied
--
administered
by
the
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
it
does
not.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
testimony
in
the
transcript
makes
clear
that
both
as
to
the
local
units
and
as
to
the
state
that
at
the
time
that
an
applicant
who
is
subject
to
this
law
applies
for
assistance.
they
are
told
what
the
law
is
and
that
if
they
do
not
qualify
because
they
do
not
have
a
job
or
sufficient
resources
to
support
themselves
for
three
months
that
the
only
help
that
the
state
will
give
them
is
to
send
them
back.
now,
the
state
defines
this
as
voluntary
return
and
it's
true
that
connecticut
no
longer
has
a
mandatory
removal
law.
but
this
information
is
passed
on
initially
at
the
initial
interview.
now,
in
the
case
of
this
particular
appellee,
she
was
offered
money
to
return
to
massachusetts
and
she
turned
this
down
on
the
grounds
that
she
had
no
intention
to
return
to
massachusetts
that
her
intention
was
to
remain
in
connecticut
as
a
resident.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
appellee
applied
for
assistance,
she
was
pregnant
and
as
a
result
of
that,
as
stipulated
to
by
the
parties
in
the
lower
court,
she
was
unable
to
either
enter
a
job
training
program
or
to
go
to
work.
in
addition
to
being
pregnant,
she
is
a
mother
of
a
child
of
less
than
one
year
of
age
and
therefore
her
place
was
in
the
home.
this
is
also
directed
in
the
transcript
and
testified
to
by
the
commissioner
of
welfare
that
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
connecticut
welfare
department
to
separate
mothers
and
minor
children
at
that
age.
now,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
the
purpose
as
admitted
by
counsel
before
the
court
this
morning
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
if
you
enter
the
state
without
a
job
at
the
time
or
without
sufficient
personal
resources
to
support
yourself
for
three
months
then
you
have
to
wait
a
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
don't
think
there
is
any
justification.
i
think
that
the
only
justification
i
have
ever
heard
is
the
one
suggested
this
morning
and
that
is
that
this
is
the
way
that
connecticut
felt
that
it
could
best
protect
its
budget
and
that
somehow
this
would
accomplish
this.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
yes
your
honor.
that
is
certainly
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
i
think
that
highlights
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that
is
to
keep
people
out
and
then
connecticut
would
go
on
and
say
as
they
have
in
their
brief
that
because
they
will
give
assistance
to
persons
who
have
come
to
the
state,
wear
the
job
or
with
sufficient
resources
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
rationalize
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
make
sure
that
only
people
who
contribute
to
the
economy
perceive
assistance
but
i
think
to
see
that
that
is
merely
a
rationalization
and
really
not
the
fact.
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
basic
grant
to
persons
who
have
lived
there
longer
than
a
year
and
the
only
thing
they
have
to
prove
is
that
they
have
the
need
and
which
means
that
if
the
person
enters
the
state
with
enough
money
to
live
for
three
months
--
well,
enters
the
state
with
enough
money
to
live
for
a
year,
all
they
have
to
do
is
regardless
of
what
they
do
in
that
either
--
if
they
dissipate
the
funds,
if
they
just
sit
around
and
do
nothing
and
at
the
end
of
that
year
and
they
come
in
and
reply
for
welfare
like
anyone
else
who
has
lived
in
the
state
for
a
year
that
they
will
get
to
welfare
if
they
can
establish
the
need.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
with
a
sufficient
cash
stake,
you're
right.
that's
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
right.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
right,
and
the
only
thing
she
has
--
right.
the
only
thing
she
has
to
establish
is
need.
that's
the
only
thing.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
right
after
three
months.
after
three
months.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
must
wait
one
year
unless
of
course
they
work
--
they
are
interrelated
and
that
is
that
job
that
would
satisfy
the
statute
but
if
they
have
either
a
job
or
the
personal
resources
then
of
course
they
must
wait
for
the
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
am
not
sure
about
the
date
of
origin.
well,
this
particular
law,
they
have
had
for
--
this
is
the
third
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
the
law
like
this
goes
back
into
the
30's?
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
into
the
30's
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
the
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
a
different
kind
of
law.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
well,
i
think
the
origin
in
this
country
was
the
removal
statute
and
connecticut
has
a
removal
statute
from
1796
until
1965.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
a
removal
statute
provided
that
as
to
those
persons
who
were
resident
--
those
persons
who
belong
to
another
state
that
those
persons
could
be
forcibly
removed
from
connecticut.
now,
that's
the
forerunner
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true
and
they're
not
--
this
law
is
not
so
different
at
least
in
purpose.
now,
this
will
also
has
a
removal
provision
but
it's
a
voluntary
removal
and
they'll
say
to
you
that,
no,
you
can't
stay
here
because
you
can't
receive
assistance
for
a
year.
now,
if
you'd
like,
we'll
pay
your
way
back
and
we'll
be
happy
to
make
sure
that
you
go
back
to
where
you
came
from
and
they
couple
the
two
together,
the
fact
that
they
can't
receive
assistance
and
that
the
only
assistance
they
can
receive
is
voluntary
return.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
this
may
have
been
the
origin
your
honor.
i
think
it's
certainly,
the
purpose
was
to
keep
--
to
keep
out
those
persons
who
are
indigents,
right.
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
issue
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
edwards
case
and
i
think
that
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
loss
of
that
nature
have
no
place
in
our
present
system
and
the
court
explicitly
said
that
settlement
laws
or
laws
of
that
sort
of
a
nature
have
no
place
in
our
system
and
that
in
fact
is
the
basis
of
one
of
our
arguments
and
that
is
that
this
law
in
fact
breaches
the
right
to
travel
as
that
right
was
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
edward's
case.
and
in
that
particular
point,
we
would
rely
expressly
on
the
court's
theory
in
that
case
where
they
said
as
i've
stated
that
the
settlement
law
notions
no
longer
have
any
place
in
our
system
and
that
in
fact,
this
is
exactly
what
connecticut
is
trying
to
do.
they're
trying
to
keep
indigents
out
of
the
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
the
most
recent
connecticut
removal
statute
was
not
quite
that
forcible.
the
state
had
a
little
more
leeway
and
they
could
turn
the
certain
issues
in
deciding
whether
or
not
they
should
in
fact
remove
a
person
merely
because
the
person
was
poor
and
they
did
not
automatically
remove.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
think
that
if
the
state
can
give
no
better
reason
for
keeping
them
off
the
indigent
roles
and
connecticut
has
in
this
case,
i
think
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
receive
assistance
immediately.
for
instance,
if
the
state
said
that
it's
necessary
to
administer
its
laws
that
they
go
through
some
sort
of
an
investigatory
period.
i
would
say
that
the
certain
state
has
the
right
to
do
this
but
this
is
not
a
duration
--
what
i'm
suggesting
now
is
not
a
durational
period
but
a
period
which
would
enable
the
state
to
administer
its
laws
properly,
certainly,
that's
a
valid
purpose
but
connecticut
has
admitted
that
it
has
not
such
need.
now,
i
just
might
turn
to
my
legal
arguments.
the
statute
as
i
have
tried
to
describe
it
is
firstly
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
because
as
the
classifications
are
drawn
between
those
persons
who
have
resided
in
the
state
for
less
than
one
year
that
the
classification
is
unconstitutional
on
its
phase.
the
classification
is
drawn
--
clearly
drawn
in
the
basis
of
wealth.
it's
drawn
in
the
basis
of
when
the
person
has
a
job,
whoever
person
has
sufficient
resources
to
support
themselves
for
one
year
and
that
clearly
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
line
of
cases
emanating
with
griffin
that
that
is
clearly
a
classification
between
rich
and
poor.
now,
when
i
use
the
word
rich,
i
may
be
using
inadvertently
but
it
is
certainly
a
classification
drawn
in
the
basis
of
wealth.
everyone
is
certainly
poor
but
there
is
the
factor
of
wealth.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
look
once
again
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
find
that
she
was
unable
to
work,
she
was
unable
to
go
into
job
training.
she
was
a
resident
of
connecticut.
the
state
admits
this
under
any
definable
--
any
definition
which
connecticut
has
laid
down
for
residence
or
domicile,
she
qualifies
and
the
only
reason
why
she
was
denied
with
the
assistance
was
because
she
was
a
newly
arrived
indigent
without
the
sufficient
resources
to
satisfy
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
there
is
nothing
in
connecticut
law
which
says
that
the
standard
which
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
set
down
to
which
i
have
sighted
in
my
brief
applies
to
all
programs
and
for
all
purposes
but
it
is
clear
that
as
to
ponder
that
standard,
she
does
qualify
as
a
domiciliary.
now,
the
state
has
stipulated
that
she
is
a
resident.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
think
the
point
i'm
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
was
that
we
do
not
rely
on
that
fact.
that
is
not
essential.
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
think
that
if
connecticut
could
satisfy
itself
that
the
person
and
in
fact
was
not
a
resident
of
the
state
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
in
this
sense,
a
state
does
not
have
the
obligation
to
pay
benefits
to
a
person
in
a
neighboring
state
who
somehow
can
come
in
to
the
state
but
yet
remain
in
the
neighboring
state.
that
person
would
be
clearly
outside
the
state's
responsibility.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
that
can't
be
done.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
correct.
that's
right.
now,
we
make
a
right
to
travel
argument
in
the
brief
and
i
think
that
we
relied
solely
on
the
edward's
case
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
travel
that
the
tied
here
is
to
the
edward's
case
is
the
fact
that
basically
the
same
issues
are
being
pressed
here
by
connecticut
that
was
being
pressed
by
california
in
that
case.
california
had
a
tremendous
burden
financially
with
indigent
persons
who
are
coming
in
to
the
state
at
that
time.
probably
a
greater
burden
that
connecticut
currently
has
and
that
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
just
take
a
brief
moment
before
i
address
myself
to
the
case
at
hand
just
to
answer
the
arguments
made
by
the
married
counsel
from
iowa.
firstly,
as
i
understand
her
argument,
she
would
define
residents
somehow
differently
than
the
law
defines
it.
she
would
expect
that
a
person
would
have
to
be
--
establish
something
more
than
presence
in
the
state
and
does
intend
to
remain
in
the
state.
she
would
expect
that
a
person
would
have
to
somehow
have
a
burden
of
proving
that
she
really
wanted
to
be
a
member
of
the
community
of
that
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well
i
think
even
as
to
domicile
at
least
in
connecticut,
domicile
is
defined
the
same
way
as
resident
presence
and
intention
and
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
don't
think
that
if
the
court
upholds
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
then
in
anyway
interferes
with
the
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
you
have
to
be
a
resident
for
six
months
not
one
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
don't
think
that
connecticut
defines
resident
as
a
person
who
is
in
the
state
for
six
months.
connecticut
just
says
you
have
to
be
in
the
state
for
six
months
before
you
can
vote.
it's
somewhat
similar
to
the
duration
of
residence
law
and
issued
before
the
court.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
the
state
has
a
valid
purpose
in
the
support
of
that
law,
the
voting
law
and
i
don't
think
it's
put
in
issue
by
the
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
that
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
as
the
court
has
said
in
--
as
it
has
been
said
recently,
a
district
court
case
which
was
not
reviewed
by
this
court,
there
is
a
problem
of
potential
fraud
in
voting
and
also,
there
is
the
requirement
that
a
person
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts
so
that
they
can
cast
their
vote
in
a
reasonable
way
and
the
objectives
of
an
election
can
be
accomplished.
i
think
that
that
is
reasonable.
i
don't
think
that
--
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
the
whole
--
this
law
unconstitutional
in
anyway,
affects
the
constitutionality
of
that
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
did
you
say
that
it
would
not
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
because
massachusetts
at
this
time
--
at
that
time,
massachusetts
also
had
a
similar
residence
law.
so
for
purposes
of
receiving
public
assistance,
if
she
could
not
receive
assistance
in
connecticut
at
least
as
to
those
other
states
that
have
residence
requirements,
she
could
not
receive
assistance
there
and
specifically,
massachusetts
from
--
the
state
from
which
she
had
come?
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
one
year.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
connecticut
has
no
provision
like
iowa
has
with
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no.
i
personally
don't
know
of
any
other
states
that
do
another
--
maybe.
i
just
don't
know
that
--
on
the
ground
that
the
action
taken
by
the
state
welfare
department
was
illegally
--
we
requested
if
their
hearing
--
their
hearing
was
held
on
the
ground
that
she
had
not
met
the
residence
requirement
and
relief
was
denied.
the
three-judge
court
panel
was
compelled
and
the
action
was
brought
before
the
district
court.
now,
during
the
period
of
time
from
the
denial
of
benefits
by
the
state
of
connecticut
and
the
termination
of
benefits
from
the
hartford
department
of
public
welfare,
the
appellee
was
supported
by
private
agents
in
connecticut,
catholic
family
services.
now,
catholic
family
services
voluntarily
provided
assistance
at
a
level
below
the
level
that
the
appellee
would
have
received
from
the
state
of
connecticut
for
approximately
23
weeks.
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
that
it's
in
the
transcript,
the
part
of
the
unprinted
record
from
the
district
court
that
the
commission
of
welfare
in
connecticut
states
quite
clearly
that
this
is
a
unique
situation
that
private
charities
cannot
be
called
upon
to
render
this
type
of
assistance
today.
they
just
do
not
have
the
funds
to
do
this.
it
was
at
the
request
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
situation
that
the
private
charity
did
this.
now,
connecticut
has
a
basic
welfare
statute
which
is
17-85
which
provides
that
any
relative
having
a
dependent
child
who
is
unable
to
furnish
suitable
support
therefore
in
his
own
home
shall
be
eligible
to
receive
afdc.
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
child
gets
the
benefits
derivatively
through
the
parent.
a
parent
must
apply.
the
child
has
no
status
to
apply
individually.
now,
this
means
that
if
you
turn
to
section
17-2d
that
even
though
a
person
is
without
--
is
unable
to
furnish
suitable
support
for
the
dependent
child
that
that
person
will
not
receive
assistance
for
the
period
of
the
duration
of
residence
law.
now,
on
its
phase,
section
17-2d
makes
ineligible
those
new
residents
who
arrive
in
the
state
without
visible
means
of
support
for
the
immediate
future.
now,
as
this
statute
has
come
to
be
administered,
pursuant
to
regulations
drafted
by
the
commission
of
welfare
and
these
regulations
are
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
in
the
printed
appendix,
benefits
are
denied
all
new
residents
in
connecticut
for
a
period
of
three
months
regardless
of
under
what
circumstances
they
have
to
the
stay
for
three
months,
they
are
denied
with
benefits.
now,
after
the
three-month
period
is
up,
the
person
who
enters
the
state
either
with
a
job
or
with
sufficient
personal
resources
to
have
supported
himself
and
his
family
for
a
period
of
three
months
is
then
eligible
to
receive
assistance.
now,
for
the
purposes
of
defining
resources,
the
state
excludes
moneys
which
come
from
relatives,
friends,
public,
private
or
voluntary
agencies.
so
what
it
boils
down
to
is
a
person
who
comes
into
the
state
and
has
saved
some
money
and
has
enough
money
saved
to
support
themselves
and
the
family
for
a
period
of
three
months
or
comes
into
the
state
with
the
job
that
that
person
is
eligible
for
assistance
after
three
months
have
elapsed.
as
to
all
other
persons,
they're
ineligible
for
one
year.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
this
applies
to
--
pursuant
to
the
statute
applies
to
afdc
and
to
what
they
call
general
assistance
which
is
the
temporary
assistance
program
administered
by
the
local
units.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
other
welfare
programs
applied
--
administered
by
the
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
it
does
not.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
testimony
in
the
transcript
makes
clear
that
both
as
to
the
local
units
and
as
to
the
state
that
at
the
time
that
an
applicant
who
is
subject
to
this
law
applies
for
assistance.
they
are
told
what
the
law
is
and
that
if
they
do
not
qualify
because
they
do
not
have
a
job
or
sufficient
resources
to
support
themselves
for
three
months
that
the
only
help
that
the
state
will
give
them
is
to
send
them
back.
now,
the
state
defines
this
as
voluntary
return
and
it's
true
that
connecticut
no
longer
has
a
mandatory
removal
law.
but
this
information
is
passed
on
initially
at
the
initial
interview.
now,
in
the
case
of
this
particular
appellee,
she
was
offered
money
to
return
to
massachusetts
and
she
turned
this
down
on
the
grounds
that
she
had
no
intention
to
return
to
massachusetts
that
her
intention
was
to
remain
in
connecticut
as
a
resident.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
appellee
applied
for
assistance,
she
was
pregnant
and
as
a
result
of
that,
as
stipulated
to
by
the
parties
in
the
lower
court,
she
was
unable
to
either
enter
a
job
training
program
or
to
go
to
work.
in
addition
to
being
pregnant,
she
is
a
mother
of
a
child
of
less
than
one
year
of
age
and
therefore
her
place
was
in
the
home.
this
is
also
directed
in
the
transcript
and
testified
to
by
the
commissioner
of
welfare
that
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
connecticut
welfare
department
to
separate
mothers
and
minor
children
at
that
age.
now,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
the
purpose
as
admitted
by
counsel
before
the
court
this
morning
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
if
you
enter
the
state
without
a
job
at
the
time
or
without
sufficient
personal
resources
to
support
yourself
for
three
months
then
you
have
to
wait
a
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
don't
think
there
is
any
justification.
i
think
that
the
only
justification
i
have
ever
heard
is
the
one
suggested
this
morning
and
that
is
that
this
is
the
way
that
connecticut
felt
that
it
could
best
protect
its
budget
and
that
somehow
this
would
accomplish
this.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
yes
your
honor.
that
is
certainly
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
i
think
that
highlights
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that
is
to
keep
people
out
and
then
connecticut
would
go
on
and
say
as
they
have
in
their
brief
that
because
they
will
give
assistance
to
persons
who
have
come
to
the
state,
wear
the
job
or
with
sufficient
resources
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
rationalize
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
make
sure
that
only
people
who
contribute
to
the
economy
perceive
assistance
but
i
think
to
see
that
that
is
merely
a
rationalization
and
really
not
the
fact.
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
basic
grant
to
persons
who
have
lived
there
longer
than
a
year
and
the
only
thing
they
have
to
prove
is
that
they
have
the
need
and
which
means
that
if
the
person
enters
the
state
with
enough
money
to
live
for
three
months
--
well,
enters
the
state
with
enough
money
to
live
for
a
year,
all
they
have
to
do
is
regardless
of
what
they
do
in
that
either
--
if
they
dissipate
the
funds,
if
they
just
sit
around
and
do
nothing
and
at
the
end
of
that
year
and
they
come
in
and
reply
for
welfare
like
anyone
else
who
has
lived
in
the
state
for
a
year
that
they
will
get
to
welfare
if
they
can
establish
the
need.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
with
a
sufficient
cash
stake,
you're
right.
that's
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
right.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
right,
and
the
only
thing
she
has
--
right.
the
only
thing
she
has
to
establish
is
need.
that's
the
only
thing.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
right
after
three
months.
after
three
months.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
must
wait
one
year
unless
of
course
they
work
--
they
are
interrelated
and
that
is
that
job
that
would
satisfy
the
statute
but
if
they
have
either
a
job
or
the
personal
resources
then
of
course
they
must
wait
for
the
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
am
not
sure
about
the
date
of
origin.
well,
this
particular
law,
they
have
had
for
--
this
is
the
third
year.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
the
law
like
this
goes
back
into
the
30's?
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
into
the
30's
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
the
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
a
different
kind
of
law.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
well,
i
think
the
origin
in
this
country
was
the
removal
statute
and
connecticut
has
a
removal
statute
from
1796
until
1965.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
a
removal
statute
provided
that
as
to
those
persons
who
were
resident
--
those
persons
who
belong
to
another
state
that
those
persons
could
be
forcibly
removed
from
connecticut.
now,
that's
the
forerunner
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true
and
they're
not
--
this
law
is
not
so
different
at
least
in
purpose.
now,
this
will
also
has
a
removal
provision
but
it's
a
voluntary
removal
and
they'll
say
to
you
that,
no,
you
can't
stay
here
because
you
can't
receive
assistance
for
a
year.
now,
if
you'd
like,
we'll
pay
your
way
back
and
we'll
be
happy
to
make
sure
that
you
go
back
to
where
you
came
from
and
they
couple
the
two
together,
the
fact
that
they
can't
receive
assistance
and
that
the
only
assistance
they
can
receive
is
voluntary
return.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
this
may
have
been
the
origin
your
honor.
i
think
it's
certainly,
the
purpose
was
to
keep
--
to
keep
out
those
persons
who
are
indigents,
right.
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
issue
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
edwards
case
and
i
think
that
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
loss
of
that
nature
have
no
place
in
our
present
system
and
the
court
explicitly
said
that
settlement
laws
or
laws
of
that
sort
of
a
nature
have
no
place
in
our
system
and
that
in
fact
is
the
basis
of
one
of
our
arguments
and
that
is
that
this
law
in
fact
breaches
the
right
to
travel
as
that
right
was
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
edward's
case.
and
in
that
particular
point,
we
would
rely
expressly
on
the
court's
theory
in
that
case
where
they
said
as
i've
stated
that
the
settlement
law
notions
no
longer
have
any
place
in
our
system
and
that
in
fact,
this
is
exactly
what
connecticut
is
trying
to
do.
they're
trying
to
keep
indigents
out
of
the
state.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
exactly
true.
the
most
recent
connecticut
removal
statute
was
not
quite
that
forcible.
the
state
had
a
little
more
leeway
and
they
could
turn
the
certain
issues
in
deciding
whether
or
not
they
should
in
fact
remove
a
person
merely
because
the
person
was
poor
and
they
did
not
automatically
remove.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
think
that
if
the
state
can
give
no
better
reason
for
keeping
them
off
the
indigent
roles
and
connecticut
has
in
this
case,
i
think
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
receive
assistance
immediately.
for
instance,
if
the
state
said
that
it's
necessary
to
administer
its
laws
that
they
go
through
some
sort
of
an
investigatory
period.
i
would
say
that
the
certain
state
has
the
right
to
do
this
but
this
is
not
a
duration
--
what
i'm
suggesting
now
is
not
a
durational
period
but
a
period
which
would
enable
the
state
to
administer
its
laws
properly,
certainly,
that's
a
valid
purpose
but
connecticut
has
admitted
that
it
has
not
such
need.
now,
i
just
might
turn
to
my
legal
arguments.
the
statute
as
i
have
tried
to
describe
it
is
firstly
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
because
as
the
classifications
are
drawn
between
those
persons
who
have
resided
in
the
state
for
less
than
one
year
that
the
classification
is
unconstitutional
on
its
phase.
the
classification
is
drawn
--
clearly
drawn
in
the
basis
of
wealth.
it's
drawn
in
the
basis
of
when
the
person
has
a
job,
whoever
person
has
sufficient
resources
to
support
themselves
for
one
year
and
that
clearly
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
line
of
cases
emanating
with
griffin
that
that
is
clearly
a
classification
between
rich
and
poor.
now,
when
i
use
the
word
rich,
i
may
be
using
inadvertently
but
it
is
certainly
a
classification
drawn
in
the
basis
of
wealth.
everyone
is
certainly
poor
but
there
is
the
factor
of
wealth.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
look
once
again
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
find
that
she
was
unable
to
work,
she
was
unable
to
go
into
job
training.
she
was
a
resident
of
connecticut.
the
state
admits
this
under
any
definable
--
any
definition
which
connecticut
has
laid
down
for
residence
or
domicile,
she
qualifies
and
the
only
reason
why
she
was
denied
with
the
assistance
was
because
she
was
a
newly
arrived
indigent
without
the
sufficient
resources
to
satisfy
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
there
is
nothing
in
connecticut
law
which
says
that
the
standard
which
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
set
down
to
which
i
have
sighted
in
my
brief
applies
to
all
programs
and
for
all
purposes
but
it
is
clear
that
as
to
ponder
that
standard,
she
does
qualify
as
a
domiciliary.
now,
the
state
has
stipulated
that
she
is
a
resident.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
i
think
the
point
i'm
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
was
that
we
do
not
rely
on
that
fact.
that
is
not
essential.
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
i
think
that
if
connecticut
could
satisfy
itself
that
the
person
and
in
fact
was
not
a
resident
of
the
state
--
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
well,
in
this
sense,
a
state
does
not
have
the
obligation
to
pay
benefits
to
a
person
in
a
neighboring
state
who
somehow
can
come
in
to
the
state
but
yet
remain
in
the
neighboring
state.
that
person
would
be
clearly
outside
the
state's
responsibility.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
no,
that
can't
be
done.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
yes.
mr.
brian
l.
hollander
that's
correct.
that's
right.
now,
we
make
a
right
to
travel
argument
in
the
brief
and
i
think
that
we
relied
solely
on
the
edward's
case
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
there
is
a
right
to
travel
that
the
tied
here
is
to
the
edward's
case
is
the
fact
that
basically
the
same
issues
are
being
pressed
here
by
connecticut
that
was
being
pressed
by
california
in
that
case.
california
had
a
tremendous
burden
financially
with
indigent
persons
who
are
coming
in
to
the
state
at
that
time.
probably
a
greater
burden
that
connecticut
currently
has
and
that
--
