justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
of
the
pass
cases
that
you
mentioned
indicated
that
the
states
stay
completely
silent.
but
the
court
can
imagine
or
can
see
of
some
rational
basis
with
the
statute
that
it
should
sustain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
concede
that
if
the
court
couldn't
imagine
any
rational
basis
the
classification
and
the
state
offered
as
in
the
case
the
redheaded
people
the
statute
should
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
i
just
asked
you
about
the
redheaded
people.
if
the
state
can't
--
if
the
state
offered
no
explanation
and
the
court
can't
imagine
the
rational
basis
for
classifying
redheaded
people
differently,
would
you
say
the
statute
falls?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
case
here
before
us
and
the
allegation
is
that
there's
no
explanation
and
the
court
shouldn't
or
couldn't
imagine
an
explanation
just
like
the
redheaded
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
connecticut
tend
just
to
limit
movement
into
the
state
if
you
think
it
can
and
if
it's
empowered
to
do
this
one
way
or
another,
why
doesn't
you
do
it
the
direct
way
or
intend
to
do
it
(voice
overlap)
let
in
so
many
people
a
year
in
moving
into
connecticut?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
say
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
restrain
them
from
coming
in
or
discourage
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
subsidized
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
once
you
consider
this
statute
as
though
it
resided
that
it's
in
a
purpose
clause
and
the
purpose
here
is
to
discourage
movement
into
the
state
of
connecticut.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
the
counsel
suggested
that
connecticut
was
innocent
in
keeping
people
out
who
are
coming
there
only
for
the
welfare
payment.
and
if
they
came
there
for
jobs,
they
weren't
coming
for
that
purpose
and
even
if
they
loss
the
job
or
needed
the
payments
at
some
point,
they
could
get
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
point
as
to
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
other
possibility
when
you
entered
the
state
of
being
able
to
get
aid
at
the
end
of
three
months
instead
of
a
year
and
you
arrived
at
least
with
cash
stake?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
first
that
comes
in
with
enough
to
do
what?
support
him
and
his
children
or
her
children
in
three
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
runs
out
of
--
her
money
is
exhausted,
she
may
then
secure
adc
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
thing
that
she
needs
to
do
to
establish
that
is
to
just
run
fresh
out
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
person
who
came
in
without
any
money
at
all
can't
get
it
after
three
months
or
has
to
wait
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
the
lady
got
a
--
this
lady
had
come
to
connecticut
to
take
care
of
her
mother
for
--
during
an
illness
for
three
months
at
no
intention
of
staying
there
that
one
led
to
another
and
she
was
is
there
six
months
--
if
connecticut
wouldn't
have
to
furnish
adc
payments
during
that
period,
why
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
constitution
require
connecticut
to
make
payments
during
that
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
that's
a
different
equal
protection
standard
once
it
comes
into
play.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
court
below
applied
the
wrong
equal
protection
standard
in
casting
this
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
suggest
that
--
if
we
agree
with
you,
do
you
suggest
we
remand
it
or
then
do
we
say
that
we
should
then
test
the
law
here
against
the
right
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
then
given
us
the
--
what
that
right
standard
--
correct
standard
is
and
suggested
some
satisfactory
basis
for
this
classification?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
the
ones
that
the
court
below
suggested?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
with
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
are
sufficient
in
your
view
to
sustain
this
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'm
just
wondering
when
you
say
it
isn't
the
first
amendment.
i
wonder
what
you
thought
it
was.
justice
byron

white
due

justice
byron

do
you
think
any

that
you
want

(voice

the

justice

i
felt
the
drop
in

justice
byron

white
to
win
this

to

this

do
you?
justice
byron

white
you
want
me
to
right
on
this
to
win
this
case.
justice
byron

white
or
you
can
just
take
are
of
the
other
one
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
mr.
cox,
if
you
had
a
thousand
units
of
some
kind
of
a
relief
to
hand
out
to
20,000
people,
would
you
still
say
it
was
an
invidious
discrimination
to
use
as
one
of
the
divisions
between
the
new
comers
and
the
old
timers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
you
have
a
thousand
ilk
they
killed
a
year
you
(inaudible)
the
ilk
for
the
people
of
the
state
and
not
let
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you're
talking
about
residence,
are
you
talking
about
duration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
you
say
that
it
doesn't
--
in
pennsylvania,
the
residency,
so-called
residency
requirement,
when
it
says
that
since
it
may
be
granted
only
if
a
person
has
resided
there
for
one
year,
it
means
that
that
person
has
to
become
a
resident
in
the
sense
of
arriving
and
not
intending
to
leave.
then
he
has
to
remain
in
that
condition
for
a
year.
isn't
that
the
meaning
of
the
pennsylvania
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
be
there
a
year
and
still
not
get
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
to
be
a
resident?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event
--
in
any
event
(voice
overlap)--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
your
law,
a
person
could
prove
that
he
is
a
resident
and
he
still
is
entitled
to
benefits.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
i
gather
that
the
justifications
for
the
pennsylvania
law
that
you
offer
primarily
in
relation
to
limiting
the
necessary
appellate
for
adc?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
anything
to
do
with
checking
residency
or
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
assume
the
possibility
of
determining
your
residency
before
you're
there
a
year
because
you've
got
to
know
when
it
starts.
you
don't
only
have
to
reside
(inaudible)
be
a
resident,
but
then
you
have
to
stay
there
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
assumes
that
before
the
time
ever
starts
to
run,
you
determined
that
you're
a
resident.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you've
indicated
that
this
year's
residence
requirement
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
some
administrative
aid
in
determining
resident,
but
really
was
aimed
and
had
a
substantive
purpose
of
encouraging
people
to
go
to
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
requires
them
to
disperse
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
important
for
you
to
--
why
is
it
important
for
you
to
make
this
argument
about
the
necessity
for
coming
to
grips
to
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
really
what
the
point
you're
making
is
that
congress
itself
has
demonstrated
what
it
thought
was
consistent
with
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
point
you
want
to
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
make
that
without
insisting
the
federal
statute
be
declared
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
federal
statute
contains
this
kind
of
a
judgment.
you
could
still
say
whether
it's
an
issue
in
the
case
or
not
that
congress
has
made
a
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
well,
i
suppose
of

how
about

answer
to
my

justice

i

i
just
asked
you
about

redheaded

if
the

can't

benefits.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
i
gather
that
the
justifications
for
the
pennsylvania
law
that
you
offer
primarily
in
relation
to
limiting
the
necessary
appellate
for
adc?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
anything
to
do
with
checking
residency
or
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
assume
the
possibility
of
determining
your
residency
before
you're
there
a
year
because
you've
got
to
know
when
it
starts.
you
don't
only
have
to
reside
(inaudible)
be
a
resident,
but
then
you
have
to
stay
there
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
assumes
that
before
the
time
ever
starts
to
run,
you
determined
that
you're
a
resident.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you've
indicated
that
this
year's
residence
requirement
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
some
administrative
aid
in
determining
resident,
but
really
was
aimed
and
had
a
substantive
purpose
of
encouraging
people
to
go
to
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
requires
them
to
disperse
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
important
for
you
to
--
why
is
it
important
for
you
to
make
this
argument
about
the
necessity
for
coming
to
grips
to
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
really
what
the
point
you're
making
is
that
congress
itself
has
demonstrated
what
it
thought
was
consistent
with
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
point
you
want
to
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
make
that
without
insisting
the
federal
statute
be
declared
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
federal
statute
contains
this
kind
of
a
judgment.
you
could
still
say
whether
it's
an
issue
in
the
case
or
not
that
congress
has
made
a
judgment.

byron
