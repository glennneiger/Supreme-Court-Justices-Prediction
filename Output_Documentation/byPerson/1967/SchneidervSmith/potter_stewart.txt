you

anybody
who
(a),
as
a
member
of
a
semi-fashion
group
and
(b)
had
employment
in
a

in
this
case,
i'm
now
reading
from
the
letter
that
you
yourself
oath
on
page
23
of
the
joined
appendix,
you
said
that
you
advised
your
client
that
it
is
possible
for
him
to
answer
the
interrogatories,
you
are
saying.
and
that
without
any
doubt,
we
would
then
receive
a
certification
which
he
both
desired
and
needs
so
that
he
may
earn
a
living
in
his
chosen
field.
there's
no
such
absolute
and
flexible
impediment
of
this
man's
employment
unless
you
are
wrong
in
the
professional
advice
that
you
represented
him.
justice

did
you
advise

that
he
could
answer

and
that
if
he
did
so,
he
get
his

get
what

justice

that's
true
about
the
time
and
everything
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
[inaudible]
am
i
correct
in
my
recollection
that
this
court
has,
at
least
once,
and
perhaps
as
i
recollect
more
than
once,
declined
to
review
cases
arising
under
the
magnuson
act
in
which,
i
think
one
case
a
radio
operator
was
declined
the
certificate
because
he
was
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
looking
at
the
statute
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief
on
a-1,
what
part
of
that
is
the
1917
legislation,
what
part
of
it
is
the
magnuson
act?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
not
all
of
the
1917
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
under
the
first
paragraph,
it's
the
1917
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
does
the
1950
legislation
begin
with
--
within
the
territory
and
the
waters
of
the
canal
zone?
justice
potter
stewart
whenever
the
president
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
1950
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
all
of
it,
right?
(a)
and
(b)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
is
an
additional
paragraph
and
then
subparagraph
(e)
and
subparagraph
(d),
and
that
is
all
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
now
about
the
commandant
on
regulations?
justice
potter
stewart
about
how
many
organizations?
it
looks
like
a
couple
of
hundred
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
but
have
counted
how
many
there
are?
i
just
see
it
them
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
more
like
300?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
must
say
i
can't
be
persuaded
mr.
martin,
that
they
intended
as
you
suggest,
to
limit
this
to
organizations
on
the
list?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
martin,
this
is
one
of
those
lines,
that
--
i
know
that
you
didn't
cite
in
your
brief
and
i
quite
understand
why
shelton
against
tucker
case
in
the
374
-
364
u.s,
but
i
as
well
surprised
to
see
that
the
appellants
also
didn't
cite
that
name,
part
of
it
i
suppose
is
a
subjective
ego
damage
of
the
author
of
that
opinion,
but
do
you
think,
in
your
view,
if
you're
familiar
with
that
case,
do
you
think
that
decision
has
relevance
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
one
in
which
--
in
arkansas
they
asked
the
school
teachers
to
list
the
names
of
every
social
--
every
organization
that
which
the
school
teachers
had
belonged
over
a
period
of
five
years,
and
the
court
--
now
because
it
was
too
broad
inquiry,
even
though
the
governmental
purpose
of
arkansas
was
perfectly
legitimate.
