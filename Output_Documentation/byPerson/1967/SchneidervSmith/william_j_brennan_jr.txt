and
you
can
answer
mr.

fortas,
[inaudible]
he
was
talking
about
those
[inaudible]
associations

and
they
think
mr.
brown
is
maybe
a

of
an
affiliate
division,
as
he
pointed
out
in
the
question
six
that
the
original

speaks
of
being
a

an

with
[inaudible]
mr.

fortas
the
standards
which
govern
whether

is
inimical
and
so

are
those
in

and
i
noticed
that
he
said
membership
in

or
sympathetic
association
with
any

on
the
list,
[inaudible]
haven't
really
had
sympathetic

[voice

as
you
pointed
out
[voice

that
the
question
six
on
the
application
is
still
talking
about
associations
with
[inaudible]
now
you
tell
us
that
the
commandant
makes
his
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
standards
of
121.03
--
there
is
sympathetic
association
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
it
has
to
mean
something
different
on
membership
in
or
affiliations
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
third
thing
is
about
sympathetic
association
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

[inaudible]
out
under

there
is
no
[voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
is
not
the

of
dubois.
he
doesn't
have
to
fill
out,
making
a
hearing
on
[inaudible]
by
a
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
man
doesn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
went
to
justice,
mr.
martin,
did
you
have
to
fill
out
something
with
direct
reference
to
the
attorney
general's
list?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
never
[inaudible]
too,
is
it
mr.
martin,
that
there's
no
hearing
at
all
until
he
finally
answer
some
of
these
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
one
that
cites
me
that
we
haven't
thought
of
yet,
at
page
35
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
interrogatory
being
--
this
is
question
two
at
page
35,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
in
anyway
the
communist
party,
its
subdivisions,
subsidiaries,
or
affiliates?”
and
how
the
heaven
would
think
can
one
know
of
how
to
answer
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
one
know
about
[inaudible]
how
does
one
know
that
a
particular
organization
is
or
isn't
affiliated
with
the
communist
party?
if
he
himself
is
merely
affiliate,
was
an
affiliate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
didn't
ask
whether
he's
been
--
i'm
asking
only
whether
he's
been
a
member
of.
he's
asked
whether
he's
been
affiliated
with
an
affiliate
of
the
communist
party.
i
don't
know
how
long
you
would
answer
that
factor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
martin
do
you
suppose
going
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
are
we
going
to
interpolate
something
like
after
the
word
‘regulation'
as
he
may
regard,
that
is
the
president,
to
be
necessary,
then
drop
down
to
be
the
safeguard
against
discussion,
would
it
interpolate
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice

would
be
necessary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
so,
then
there
is
a
serious
question
of
whether
the
opinion
is
sufficiently
defined
delegation
to
the
president,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
getting
back
to
some
of
the
things
i
thought
in
the
robel
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
make
a
distinction
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
intend
any
[voice

nothing
i
said
to
robel
would

i
would
have
just
[voice

--
justice
william

that
was
a

you're
