correct?

the

there

another

to

the

and
if
there
is,
and
then
the
administrative
remedy
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
was
inquiring
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
there
wasn't
many?
i
thought
you
said
there
was
any
dispute
on
that
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
government
does
make
the
argument
that
this
is
a
premature
because
mr.
schneider
has
not
exhausted
in
this
administrative
remedy?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
say
that
--
if
the
government
concede
that
he
has
got
to
answer
the
interrogatory
--
justice
abe
fortas
--before
he
can
pursue
any
other
remedies?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
therefore
by
the
referent
of
the
word
such,
you
have
the
statute
before
you.
justice
abe
fortas
the
president
is
authorized
to
institute
such
major
–
institute
such
rules
and
regulations,
such
as
what?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
not
an
error,
that
you
have
omitted
any
thing
from
printing?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
surely
an
incomplete
sentence,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martin,
excuse
me.
these
organizations
are
all
on
the
attorney
general's

and
there's
no
organization
here
that
is
not
on
the
attorney

or
that
has
been
removed
from
the
attorney
general's

is
that
was
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
page
35
of
the
joint
appendix
on
their
response
to
–
the
commandant's
response
to
his
answer,
he's
asked
to
list
the
name
of
the
political
and
social
organizations
to
which
he
belonged
that
does
not
--
but
it
is
not
limited
to
the
attorney
general's
list.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he's
asked
to
make
a
contribution,
to
list
his
contributions
–
contributions,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
you
say
that
mr.
martin,
it
says,
with
respect
does
your
statements
involve,
that's
on
page
35
of
the
joint
appendix,
his
statement
above
said,
i
have
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
including
several
that
is
on
this
list
and
then
the
commandant
says,
“with
respect
to
your
statements
above,
list
the
names
of
the
political
and
social
organizations
to
which
you
belong,
et

justice
abe
fortas
but
let's
say
are
we
really
--
are
we
talking
here
about
government
employees?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
another
question?
apart
from
this
procedure,
the
certificates
for
--
a
mariner's
certificates
for
--
where
does
this
fall,
an
engineer?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
issued
by
the
coast
guard?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
was
a
special
requirement
and
added
to
the
usual
certification
procedures?
justice
abe
fortas
but
now
these
men
were
working
for
private
employers
and
privately
owned
vessels?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
united
states
says
--
passed
the
magnuson

currently
passed
the
magnuson

that
said
that
in
order
to
work
on
a

vessel,
you've
got
satisfy
these
requirements
and
subject
for
[voice

justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
think
there
are
any
limitations
on
what
can
be
asked
of
a
man
to
represent
under
oath
as
a
condition
of
private
employment
in
any
industry
in
which
is
vital
to
the
national
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
there
are
no
first
amendment
limitations
on
that
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
at
the
moment
--
what's
bothering
me
is
a
question
of
how
--
that
is
to
say
whether
there
are
some
limitations,
procedural
or
substantive
upon
how
the
government
may
go
about
it
and
i
hear
what
they
asked
this
man,
it
seems
just
offhand
--
it
seems
kind
of
impossible
to
answer,
and
they
required
him
to
answer
it
under
oath,
as
they
require
him
to
say
or
list
under
oath
his
political
and
social
organizations
and
how
much
money
he
gave
to
them,
what
his
contributions
had
been,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera
and
they
give
him
a
form
to
be
filled
out
before
a
notary
public
under
oath.
now,
there
is
some
[inaudible]
what
i'm
really
going
to
ask
here
is
--
do
you
think
there
are
any
--
do
you
think
there
are
any
limitations
on
the
power
of
the
government,
either
in
terms
of
the
method
that
it
requires
for
disclosing
information
or
in
terms
of
the
substance
of
the
information
that
it
requires
to
be
disclosed?
justice
abe
fortas
[voice

it
seems
to
me
you've
got
similar
thing
as
to
establish
--
i
know
your
position
on
it,
i
am
not
suggesting
spending
a
time
on
it
--
establish
that
the
commandant
may
communicate
it
to
this
applicant
about
what
he's
talking
about,
and
certainly
i
think
we
all
agree
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
question
stated
by
the
commandant
in
response
to
the
first
filing
by
this
applicant.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
second
--
of
course,
the
second
thing
you
have
to
establish
is
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
--
these
questions
as
stated
not
merely
listing
membership,
not
merely
listing
whether
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
in
these
organizations
but
also
listing
contributions
and
all
the
rest
of
this
stuff
that's
in
here
as
a
reasonable
way
--
a
reasonable
part
of
a
procedure
which
let
us
assume
that
is
permissible
in
its
objective?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
your
question,
i
know
i'm
taking
more
of
your
time?
section
121.07
on
page
a14
of
the
appellant's
brief,
that
the
commandant
is
satisfied
that
the
character
and
habits
of
life
of
the
applicant
are
such
as
to
warrant
the
belief
that
his
presence
on
board
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
inimical
to
the
spirit
of
the
united
states,
on
directive
of
special
validation
endorsement
of
the
issue.
now,
that
is
the
ultimate
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
it's
the
standard
that
says
that
a
commandant
has
to
believe
that
the
presence
of
the
person
affirmatively,
that
the
presence
of
the
person
on
board
the
u.s.
vessels
would
not
be
inimical
to
the
security
of
the
united

is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
ascertain
that,
he
looks
at
the
character
and
the
habits
of
life
of
the
applicants,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
you,
those
standards
are
--
don't
raise
any
first
amendment
problems?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
guess
the
least
we
could
say
is
that
--
it
is
really
sad,
but
this
area
dealing
with
the
man
whose
livelihood
and
with
his
liberty
that
there
has
been
a
certain
--
we're
falling
quite
far
and
short
of
--
for
the
position
that
might
be
desired.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
the
question
is
little
more
refined
than
that.
the
question
is
can
they
do
it
this
way?
justice
abe
fortas
can
they
do
it
this
way?
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
martin?
do
you
know
whether
a
person
applying
for
a
position
with
let
us
say
the
atomic
energy
commission,
has
to
go
through
a
procedure
that
is
comparable
to
this
and
yet
he
has
to
fill
out
this
kind
of
a
questionnaire
with
reference
to
organizations
and
associations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
are
the
regulations
comparable
to
these,
does
the
word
sympathetic
--
the
phrase
sympathetic
association?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martin,
why
do
you
make
of
this
incomplete
sentence
as
i
see
it?
the
word
‘such'
is
generally
a
word
indicating
the
limitation
is
going
to
follow,
that
is
to
say
authorizing
the
president
to
institute
such
measures,
and
issue
such
rules
and
regulations,
and
ordinarily
that
would
be
followed
by
some
of
these
to
effect
as
maybe
essential
or
as
maybe
necessary
in
the
circumstances
and
like
that,
but
the
statute
apparently
uses
the
word
‘such'
and
that's
all.
justice
abe
fortas
[voice
overlap]
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking,
further
what
i
had
in
mind
and
it's
so
would
that
going
in
mind
whether
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
the
magnuson
act
to
authorize
this
highly
particularized
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
1917
act
that
would
indicate
this
kind
of
certification
of
persons
as
an
appropriate
procedure
regardless
of
what
they
would
do
[voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
such
referring
to
an
amorphous
course
of
conduct
that
says
further
also
feeding
them
chicken
once
a
week
and
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
--
let
me
ask
you
this
specifically.
there's
nothing
in
the
bills
preceding
drafts
of
the
legislation
that
would
indicate
what
such
--
what
was
supposed
to
follow
such
or
what
is
the
referent
to
that
word
“such”?
justice
abe
fortas
when
that
third
course
which
course
to
do
search
some
administrator
of
channels
set
fort
in
the
regulations.
justice
abe
fortas
when
the
appellee
and
you
are
in
conflict
on
that
term,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
the
appellee
argued
that
there
is
another
way
to
read
the
regulations
and
if
there
is,
and
then
the
administrative
remedy
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
was
inquiring
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
there
wasn't
many?
i
thought
you
said
there
was
any
dispute
on
that
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
government
does
make
the
argument
that
this
is
a
premature
because
mr.
schneider
has
not
exhausted

this
administrative

justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
say
that
--
if
the

concede
that
he
has
got
to
answer
the
interrogatory
--
justice
abe
fortas
--before
he
can
pursue
any
other
remedies?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
therefore
by
the
referent
of
the
word
such,
you
have
the
statute
before
you.
justice
abe
fortas
the

is
authorized

this

it's
surely
an

isn't

justice
abe
fortas
mr.

excuse
me.
these

is
that

you're

justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
page
35
of
the
joint

on
their
response
to

the

response
to
his

he's
asked

that

not

but
it
is
not

justice

then
he's
asked
to
make
a

to
list
his
contributions
–
contributions,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
you
say
that
mr.

it
says,
with
respect
does
your

involve,
that's
on

of

i
have

let's
say
are
we
really
--
are
we
talking
here
about
government
employees?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
another
question?
apart
from
this
procedure,
the
certificates
for

a
mariner's

for

where
does
this
fall,
an

justice
abe
fortas
are
those
issued
by

justice
abe
fortas
and
this
was
a
special
requirement
and
added
to
the
usual

justice
abe
fortas
but
now
these
men
were
working

justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
think
there
are
any

what
can
be

of
a

to
represent
under

as
a

justice

fortas
you
said
there
are
no

limitations
on
that
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
at
the
moment
--
what's
bothering
me
is
a
question
of
how
--
that
is
to
say
whether
there
are
some
limitations,
procedural
or
substantive
upon
how
the
government
may
go
about
it
and
i
hear
what
they
asked
this
man,
it
seems
just
offhand

it
seems
kind
of
impossible
to
answer,
and
they
required
him
to
answer
it

as
they

him
to

or
list
under

his

how
much

he

what

et

et

and
they
give
him
a

be
filled
out
before
a
notary
public
under

now,
there
is
some
[inaudible]
what
i'm
really
going
to
ask
here
is
--
do
you
think
there
are
any
--
do
you
think
there
are
any
limitations
on
the
power
of
the

either
in

that
it
requires

that
it
requires

justice

fortas
[voice

it
seems
to
me
you've
got
similar
thing
as
to
establish
--
i
know
your

i
am
not

establish

the

about
what
he's

and
certainly
i
think
we
all
agree
that
there
is
an

the
question
stated

in
response
to
the

justice
abe
fortas
and
the
second
--
of
course,
the
second
thing
you
have
to
establish
is
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
--
these
questions
as
stated
not
merely
listing

not
merely

whether
you
are

also

right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
ascertain
that,
he
looks
at
the
character
and
the
habits
of
life
of
the
applicants,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
you,
those
standards
are
--
don't
raise
any
first
amendment
problems?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
guess
the
least
we
could
say
is
that
--
it
is
really
sad,
but
this
area
dealing
with
the
man
whose
livelihood
and
with
his
liberty
that
there
has
been
a
certain
--
we're
falling
quite
far
and
short
of
--
for
the
position
that
might
be
desired.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
the
question
is
little
more
refined
than
that.
the
question
is
can
they
do
it
this
way?
justice
abe
fortas
can
they
do
it
this
way?
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
martin?
do
you
know
whether
a
person
applying
for
a
position
with
let
us
say
the
atomic
energy
commission,
has
to
go
through
a
procedure
that
is
comparable
to
this
and
yet
he
has
to
fill
out
this
kind
of
a
questionnaire
with
reference
to
organizations
and
associations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
are
the
regulations
comparable
to
these,
does
the
word
sympathetic
--
the
phrase
sympathetic
association?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martin,
why
do
you
make
of
this
incomplete
sentence
as
i
see
it?
the
word
‘such'
is
generally
a
word
indicating
the
limitation
is
going
to
follow,
that
is
to
say
authorizing
the
president
to
institute
such
measures,
and
issue
such
rules
and
regulations,
and
ordinarily
that
would
be
followed
by
some
of
these
to
effect
as
maybe
essential
or
as
maybe
necessary
in
the
circumstances
and
like
that,
but
the
statute
apparently
uses
the
word
‘such'
and
that's
all.
justice
abe
fortas
[voice
overlap]
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking,
further
what
i
had
in
mind
and
it's
so
would
that
going
in
mind
whether
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
the
magnuson
act
to
authorize
this
highly
particularized
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
1917
act
that
would
indicate
this
kind
of
certification
of
persons
as
an
appropriate
procedure
regardless
of
what
they
would
do
[voice
overlap]
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
such
referring
to
an
amorphous
course
of
conduct
that
says
further
also
feeding
them
chicken
once
a
week
and
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
--
let
me
ask
you
this
specifically.
there's
nothing
in
the
bills
preceding
drafts
of
the
legislation
that
would
indicate
what
such
--
what
was
supposed
to
follow
such
or
what
is
the
referent
to
that
word
“such”?
