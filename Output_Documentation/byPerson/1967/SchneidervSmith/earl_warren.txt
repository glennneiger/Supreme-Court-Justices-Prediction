--
versus

commandant,
united

coast
guard.
mr.
schroeter,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
published
by
the
communist
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
if
we
find
--
we're
to
find
that
the
regulation
is
over
broad
would
it
be
necessary
for
us
to
reach
the
executive
order
and
the
statute
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
martin,
i
thought
one
of
the
questions
was,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of,
or
affiliated,
or
associated
with,
in
anyway
any
of
the
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list
that
proliferates
to
a
very
great
degree,
doesn't
it,
to
say
or
associated
with
in
any
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
it
also
say
or
associated
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
was
asked
once
about
this,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin
i'd
like
to
refer
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
and
i'm
going
to
read
just
a
few
lines
from
the
appellant's
brief.
he
says,
“appellant
applied
to
the
coast
guard
for
the
required
special
validation
that
was
existing
merchant
mariner
documents.
as
a
part
of
this
application
for
this
special
validation,
appellant
was
required
to
answer
under
oath
the
question,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
or
associated
with
in
anyway
any
of
the”
and
the
rest
of
the
--
concerning
the
approximate
280
organizations
named
by
the
attorney
general
is
subversive
which
organizations
were
listed
in
the
application
ja
27
to
33?”
he
answered,
“yes”
and
that
would
an
explanation,
i
have
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
and
so
forth.
now,
i
told
--
i
thought
you
told
me
that
that
wasn't
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
this
is
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
do
we
get
ja
27
to
33?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
supposed
that
of
these
280
organizations,
all
having
them
proscribed
because
they
were
affiliated
in
some
way
with
the
communist
movement
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
many
of
these
organizations
could
in
some
way
be
affiliated
with
each
other,
and
now
without
a
member
of
one
of
them
having
any
idea
perhaps
of
what
that
affiliation
might
be
or
whether
there
was
any
affiliation.
still
you
require
--
you
require
this
man
to
say
under
oath
what
affiliation
any
of
those
organizations
might
have?
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
in
the
days
when
this
was
initiated
there
was
a
great
danger
of
a
man
going
to
the
penitentiary
if
he
misstated
any
of
those
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that,
i'm
talking
about
the
over
breadth
of
this
regulation
as
it
was
applied
to
this
man.
and
let
me
ask
you
this
also,
you
cited
that
the
--
our
action
in
the
dubois
case
yesterday.
there
is
some
difference
between
the
two
cases
in
there
because
in
the
dubois
case,
they
were
trying
to
avoid
all
the
entire
administrative
process
and
wanted
us
to
take
the
case
and
decide
it
on
the
merits
of
it.
in
this
case,
a
man
was
demanding
a
hearing
and
he
wasn't
given
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
did
he
say
it
in
the
--
in
his
application
answering
the
questions
that
they
were
propounded
to
him,
did
he
say,
“you
have
no
right
to
know?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
he
is
complaining
that
he
wasn't
given
a
hearing.
now,
do
they
have
a
right
to
compel
him
to
give
all
these
answers
to
the
extent
that
they
can
deny
him,
convict
him
on
what
he
says
before
they
give
him
a
hearing
or
is
he
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
at
which
witnesses
will
determine
the
truth
or
falsity
or
the
relevance
of
the
questions
that
are
asked
to
him
so
he
can
have
a
record
upon
which
to
obtain
judicial
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
in
your
opinion,
could
he
make
the
investigation
and
determine
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
it
and
deny
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
he
then
deny
it?
why
could
he
deny
this
man
on
his
application
and
that
let
him
--
let
him
demand
a
hearing
if
he
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
say
that.
he
didn't
say
that
here.
he
filed
answers
to
all
of
the
questions
that
were
asked.
they
might
not
have
been
sufficient.
they
might
not
have
satisfied
the
commandant.
why
couldn't
the
commandant
say,
“i
deny
your
certification”
and
then
the
man
as
you
say
is
entitled
to
demand
a
hearing
and
he
would
be
given
a
hearing,
but
why
shouldn't
they
do
that
instead
of
saying,
“no
you
never
can
have
a
hearing
until
you
give
us
answers
to
questions
that
are
not
in
regulations
that
are
propounded
by
us
and
until
you
answer
that
we
won't
give
you
a
hearing”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
couldn't
he
say?
why
couldn't
he
say,
“your
answers
to
our
questions
are
not
sufficient
for
us
to
determine
whether
you
are
qualified
for
this
position
or
not.
your
application
is
denied.”
then
as
you
say,
if
it's
denied
in
that
way
he
has
a
right
to
demand
a
hearing.
now,
why
couldn't
that
be
done
in
order
that
the
man
could
get
his
judicial
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
say
he
wanted
to
deny
him,
deny
him
the
right
to
have
that
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know?
how
do
a
commandant
know
that
that's
all
that
will
happen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
would
come
in
and
say,
“well,
now
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
resigned
a
long
time
ago
and
i'm
no
longer
interested
in
it.
but
i
think
what
i
read
in
the
newspapers
is
my
personal
business
and
i
don't
propose
to
answer
that
because
they're
invasion
of
my
first
amendment
rights,
i
don't
propose
to
answer
this
question
and
that
question
because
i
believe
it's
an
invasion
of
my
rights,”
then
they
could
take
whatever
action
they
wanted
and
the
man
is
entitled
to
judicial
review,
but
when
the
commandant
says,
“well,
[inaudible]
we
won't
give
you
a
hearing
until
you
answer
all
the
questions
that
we
want
to
propound
to
you”.
the
man
is
never
in
the
position
as
you
claim
here
to
come
in
and
have
any
judicial
review.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
jurisdictional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
that
be
the
question
when
they
haven't
given
him
a
hearing
where
he
can
assert
his
reasons,
why
he
doesn't
want
to
ask
--
answer
particular
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
all
to
be
done
and
wrapped
up
and
the
man
convicted
before
he
has
a
hearing
even?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
forced
him
to
–
you
forced
him
into
those
things
because
you
won't
give
him
a
hearing
on
which
he
can
have
a
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
concede
that
this
man
should
have
been
given
a
hearing
and
that
we
should
say
--
sent
it
back
and
say
that
he
should
be
given
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
do
you
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
not
only
what
did
he
belonged
to
but
what
organizations
that
he
belonged
to
that
were
affiliated
with
any
other
organization
that
was
prescribed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
the
basic
question
of
the
application?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
you
will
not
question
a
man
who's
charged
with
affiliations
in
this
situation.
i
notice
that
the
fourth
or
fifth
name
on
the
list
of
attorney
general
says
american
christian
nationalist
party.
now
suppose
the
man
did
not
belong
to
that
organization,
but
he
did
belong
to
the
church
from
which
the
members
that
came
and
from
which
the
organization
--
the
party
was
organized,
would
you
say
that
the
man
have
to
answer
whether
he
belonged
to
the
church
because
in
other
--
it
might
--
while
he
was
not
a
member
of,
he
might
be
affiliated
in
some
way
with
it
[voice

this
item
six,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
in
anyway,
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
mean
by
that
they
could
set
up
an
organization
that
would
include
the
same
members
under
another
name
and
they're
affiliated
closely
with
it
and
that
if
they
were
not
on
this
list,
he
wouldn't
have
to
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
that
he
would
not
have
to
mention
the
church
that
was
affiliated
with
this
organization
and
from
which
this
organizations
sprang,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
concerning
the
communist
party,
he
didn't
belonged
to
the
communist
party
but
he
belonged
to
some
other
organization
called
the
xy
social
club,
and
that
was
affiliated
with
the
--
in
some
way
with
the
communist
party,
would
you
say
you
have
to
list,
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
it
is,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
how
do
you
distinguish
these
two
organizations
that
i've
been
mentioning
to
you?
chief
justice
earl

[voice

belonged

chief

chief

mr.

i'd

“yes”
and
that
would

i

so

now,
i
told
--
i
thought
you
told

that
that
wasn't

chief
justice
earl

you
say
this
is

chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
do
we
get
ja
27

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
supposed
that
of
these
280

all

still

you

what

any

might

[voice

chief

chief

warren
i
understand
that,
i'm
talking
about
the
over
breadth
of
this
regulation
as
it
was
applied
to
this
man.
and
let
me
ask
you
this
also,
you
cited
that
the
--
our
action
in
the
dubois
case
yesterday.
there
is
some
difference
between
the
two
cases
in
there
because
in
the

they
were

avoid

and
wanted

to

in

a

was

chief

did

chief

earl
warren
[voice

did
he
say
it
in
the
--
in
his
application
answering
the
questions
that
they
were
propounded
to
him,
did
he
say,
“you
have
no
right
to
know?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
he
is
complaining
that
he
wasn't
given
a
hearing.
now,
do
they
have
a
right
to
compel
him
to
give
all
these
answers
to
the
extent
that
they
can
deny
him,
convict
him
on

he

he

chief

then
in
your

could
he
make
the
investigation
and
determine
that
he
was
not
entitled
to

and
deny
it?
chief
justice
earl

why
can't
he
then
deny
it?
why
could
he
deny
this
man
on
his
application
and
that
let
him
--
let
him
demand
a
hearing
if
he
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
say
that.
he
didn't
say
that
here.
he
filed
answers
to
all
of
the
questions
that
were
asked.
they
might
not
have
been
sufficient.
they
might
not
have
satisfied
the
commandant.
why
couldn't
the
commandant
say,
“i
deny
your
certification”
and
then
the
man
as
you
say
is
entitled
to
demand
a
hearing
and
he
would
be
given
a
hearing,
but
why
shouldn't
they
do
that
instead
of
saying,
“no
you
never
can
have
a
hearing
until
you
give
us
answers
to
questions
that
are
not
in
regulations
that
are
propounded
by
us
and
until
you
answer
that
we
won't
give
you
a
hearing”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
couldn't
he
say?
why
couldn't
he
say,
“your
answers
to
our
questions
are
not
sufficient
for
us
to
determine
whether
you
are
qualified
for
this
position
or
not.
your
application
is
denied.”
then
as
you
say,
if
it's
denied
in
that
way
he
has
a
right
to
demand
a
hearing.
now,
why
couldn't
that
be
done
in
order
that
the
man
could
get
his
judicial
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
say
he
wanted
to
deny
him,
deny
him
the
right
to
have
that
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know?
how
do
a
commandant
know
that
that's
all
that
will
happen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
would
come
in
and
say,
“well,
now
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
resigned
a
long
time
ago
and
i'm
no
longer
interested
in
it.
but
i
think
what
i
read
in
the
newspapers
is
my
personal
business
and
i
don't
propose
to
answer
that
because
they're
invasion
of
my
first
amendment
rights,
i
don't
propose
to
answer
this
question
and
that
question
because
i
believe
it's
an
invasion
of
my
rights,”
then
they
could
take
whatever
action
they
wanted
and
the
man
is
entitled
to
judicial
review,
but
when
the
commandant
says,
“well,
[inaudible]
we
won't
give
you
a
hearing
until
you
answer
all
the
questions
that
we
want
to
propound
to
you”.
the
man
is
never
in
the
position
as
you
claim
here
to
come
in
and
have
any
judicial
review.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
jurisdictional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
that
be
the
question
when
they
haven't
given
him
a
hearing
where
he
can
assert
his
reasons,
why
he
doesn't
want
to
ask
--
answer
particular
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
all
to
be
done
and
wrapped
up
and
the
man
convicted
before
he
has
a
hearing
even?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
forced
him
to
–
you
forced
him
into
those
things
because
you
won't
give
him
a
hearing
on
which
he
can
have
a
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
concede
that
this
man
should
have
been
given
a
hearing
and
that
we
should
say
--
sent
it
back
and
say
that
he
should
be
given
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
do
you
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
not
only
what
did
he
belonged
to
but
what
organizations
that
he
belonged
to
that
were
affiliated
with
any
other
organization
that
was
prescribed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
the
basic
question
of
the
application?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
you
will
not
question
a
man
who's
charged
with
affiliations
in
this
situation.
i
notice
that
the
fourth
or
fifth
name
on
the
list
of
attorney
general
says
american
christian
nationalist
party.
now
suppose
the
man
did
not
belong
to
that
organization,
but
he
did
belong
to
the
church
from
which
the
members
that
came
and
from
which
the
organization
--
the
party
was
organized,
would
you
say
that
the
man
have
to
answer
whether
he
belonged
to
the
church
because
in
other
--
it
might
--
while
he
was
not
a
member
of,
he
might
be
affiliated
in
some
way
with
it
[voice

this
item
six,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
in
anyway,
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
mean
by
that
they
could
set
up
an
organization
that
would
include
the
same
members
under
another
name
and
they're
affiliated
closely
with
it
and
that
if
they
were
not
on
this
list,
he
wouldn't
have
to
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
that
he
would
not
have
to
mention
the
church
that
was
affiliated
with
this
organization
and
from
which
this
organizations
sprang,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
concerning
the
communist
party,
he
didn't
belonged
to
the
communist
party
but
he
belonged
to
some
other
organization
called
the
xy
social
club,
and
that
was
affiliated
with
the
--
in
some
way
with
the
communist
party,
would
you
say
you
have
to
list,
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
it
is,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
how
do
you
distinguish
these
two
organizations
that
i've
been
mentioning
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
belonged
to
the
church?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
going
right
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[voice
overlap]
you
don't
have
to
answer
of
any
of
them,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
schroeter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
do
that
submitting
to
us
that
questionnaire
that
you
have,
with
the
statement
as
to
where
it
was
--
as
to
where
it
was
used.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
there
is
response
needed
you
may
make.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
