mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
with
the
court's
permission,
mr.
caughlan
is
before
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
briefly
answer
a
couple
of
questions
and
then
talk
explicitly
about
what
really
i
think
is
importance
suggestion
as
to
methods
by
which
this
case
may
perhaps
be
disposed
of
which
your
honors
have
asked
a
number
of
times
and
mr.
martin
and
i
have
some
ideas
concerning
it.
first,
relating
to
question
that
--
well,
i
like
to
first
apologize
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
horrified
at
the
omission
of
shelton.
the
only
apology
i
have
is
that,
you
really
cited
that
fully
in
cramp,
and
we
thought
we
sort
to
covered
the
waterfront
by
referring
to
an
argument,
very
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
i
understand.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
no,
we
are
impressed
with
the
reasoning
and
applicability
of
it,
really.
secondly,
the
question
that
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
just
asked,
is
similar
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
earlier
that
i
just
briefly
like
to
comment
upon.
whatever
the
coast
guard's
understanding
of
the
question
was,
it
was
mr.
schneider's
understanding
and
mine
that
it
included
every
organization
that
you
ever
belonged
to.
and
part
of
the
problem
we
had
among
other
things
is
that
--
or
had
affiliations
with,
mr.
schneider's
family
had
come
over
from
the
old
country.
they
were
jewish
and
they
belong
to
a
number
of
groups
that
automatically
merged
into
the
jewish
people's
fraternal
order
on
that
list,
with
the
(inaudible)
society
on
the
list,
mr.
schneider
as
a
child
had
grown
up
in
this
kind
of
thing
which
was
rather
peculiar
to
ghetto
culture
when
jews
came
over
to
this
country.
do
we
list
them?
do
we
not
list
them?
did
he
belong?
didn't
he
belong
to?
we
talked
about
what
he
belonged
to
when
he
was
four
years
old
don't
we?
that's
enough
to
drive
a
lawyer
to
drink.
i
mean
you
have
no
idea
what
to
advice
him
or
not
advice
him,
that
was
really
perfectly
horrible.
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
because
that
--
well,
we
did
say
and
i
call
your
attention
to
page
22,
in
my
letter
i
said
look,
mr.
schneider
doesn't
--
have
no
objections
whatsoever
to
privately
discussing
his
past
or
present
political
attitude,
he's
not
ashamed
of
anything.”
i
said
in
the
letter,
“we
offered
to
go
with
the
coast
guard
and
talk
to
them
privately”.
now,
the
only
thing
they
could
have
found
out
is
that
he
belonged
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
jewish
community
center
for
the
past
15
years,
it
wasn't
anything
we
were
worried
about.
but
we've
done
--
we'll
work
and
say
it
under
oath,
we
just
felt
that
this
was
an
absurd
to
have
to
write
all
these
essays
under
oath,
to
have
to
answer
questions
that
were
simply
not
capable
of
being
answered
adequately.
if
the
coast
guard
want
--
had
any
real
question
about
this
man,
they
could've
asked
it
which
goes
of
course
to
the
total
position
of
the
government.
the
government,
the
helpless
united
states
government
has
no
way
to
know
anything
about
mr.
schneider
even
though
for
five
months,
the
fbi
had
had
the
file,
even
though
whatever
of
these
organizations
are
still
alive,
have
more
fbi
agents
than
they
do
people,
for
heaven's
sake
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
probably
in
the
clan
too.
i
suspect
so.
there's
just
no
question,
the
government
knows
more
about
schneider
than
schneider
knows
about
schneider.
and
for
five
months,
they've
had
ample
opportunity
to
go
to
their
ibm
records
on
him
and
talking
to
them,
we
knew
they
knew
the
whole
story
about
him.
i
thought
the
coast
guard
people,
they
knew
everything
about
schneider
and
they
come
up
with
this
pious
nonsense
that
he
has
to
answer
the
questions
so
they
have
a
basis
to
go
ahead,
that's
simply
factually
false.
they
knew
everything
about
him.
what
they
were
seeking
to
do
is
to
make
him
conform
by
answering
questions
under
oath
that
were
unanswerable.
and
if
there's
any
question
that
this
is
still
what
they're
up,
which
is
what
mr.
brennan
asked,
what
kind
of
question
do
they
ask?
i
have
in
my
hand
a
questionnaire
that
we
received
two
weeks
ago
from
a
man
in
which
they
say,
“in
1949,
were
you
a
member
of
the
progressive
party
of
washington
in
1950
and
1951
and
1952?
did
you
attend
a
bazaar
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
people's
world
for
the
purpose
of
raising
funds?”
they
asked,
“did
you
attend
any
meetings?”
now,
listen,
“did
you
attend
any
meetings
with
an
official
of
the
communist
party,
you
know,
give
dates
and
places
of
such
of
meetings
and
what
officials?”
well,
who
knows
whether
they
attend
meetings
on
and
on
and
on.
and
mister
--
it
is
suggested
by
the
government
that
this
is
relevant
by
a
set
of
standards
that
the
government
adopts
that
this
is
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
character
and
habits
of
this
man
are
inimical
for
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
this
particular
man?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
mr.
schneider
or
the
man
who
got
this?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
mr.
schneider
simply
has
never
managed
to
go
to
sea
for
three
years
despite
his
deep
desire
to
do
so.
he
is
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
that's
right
as,
i
indicated
he
had
decided
in
1964,
when
his
children
were
right
on
age,
so
they
didn't
mind
being
away
from
home
so
much,
that
he
would
ship,
he
has
continued
in
a
land
job
in
which
he
makes
substantially
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
which
he's
had,
and
he's
some
kind
of
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
no.
on
a
private
industry,
just
this,
this
is
a
private
industry.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
now,
this
of
course
--
the
relevance
of
these
questions,
it
seems
to
me
is
critical
and
it
really
gets
to
what
to
me
is
the
heart
of
the
whole
case.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
and
appellant
i
think
agree
about
is
the
high
desirability
that
you
look
at
the
entire
program.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
we've
denied
cert
in
other
case
that's
similar,
have
we
not,
and
there
are
--
mr.
justice
warren
has
asked
questions
about,
“well,
can
we
limit
this
to
the
regulations?
can
we
send
it
back
and
say,
give
the
man
his
hearing?”
i
suggest
to
you
that
implicit,
what
i
tried
to
suggest
yesterday,
implicit
in
the
heart
of
this
program,
is
its
defect.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
is
capable
of
regulating
the
program
that
would
deal
sensitively
with
the
minds
and
hearts
and
feelings
of
people
who
had
to
go
through
this.
i
don't
think
he
is
capable
of
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
separation
of
powers
would
permit
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
device
reasonably
at
least
they've
been
notoriously
unsuccessful,
devise
a
program
that
could
possibly
meet
the
feelings
of
this
court
about
such
matters.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir,
but
the
vice
of
the
matter
and
this
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
i
don't
know
who
ultimately
rights
the
regulation.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
right.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
i
don't
think
constitutionally,
we
reach
beyond
that.
practically
what
happens,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
our
argument
reaches
that,
yes
sir.
and
with
respect
to
that
particular
point,
i
think
this
court
can
easily
decide
this
question
by
simply
saying
and
we
have
read
everything
in
your
library,
mr.
caughlan
and
i,
that
we
can
find,
there
isn't
a
shred
of
a
word
that
suggests
that
in
language
or
otherwise,
a
screening
program,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
nothing
in
the
executive
order.
we
don't
get
a
screening
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
well,
there
was
not
such
a
program
in
world
war
i
as
far
as
i
can
make
out.
if
there
was
a
program
in
world
war
ii,
it
comes
from
some
knowledge
that
is
not
found
in
the
courts
of
this
--
the
library
of
this
court.
now,
it
is
my
knowledge
from
asking
people
not
from
this
that
there
was
a
kind
of
a
program
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
program
there
is
here,
nor
was
it
administered
by
the
coast
guard.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
right
[voice
overlap],
yes,
fascinatingly
at
the
time
when
he
was
a
member
of
communist
party.
that's
the
time
when
he
was
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
there
were
some
kind
of
a
very
loose
form
of
screening
program,
but
the
heart
of
this
is
and
to
me
the
heart
of
the
issue
before
this
court
and
it's
this
--
that
this
court
can
and
has
said
many
things
for
many
years
about
programs
of
this
kind
and
i
need
to
reiterate
this
court's
decision.
and
this
court
recognizes
they
are
multiple
ways
in
which
you
can
decide
this
question,
but
is
this
a
proper
occasion,
this
kind
of
a
case,
for
the
exercise
of
judicial
limitation?
i
suggest
not
and
i
suggest
not
because
the
central
problem
of
our
society
it
seems
to
me
is
not
that
this
court
does
not
articulate
magnificently
what
the
constitution
is
all
about.
that
isn't
our
problem.
the
problem
is
that
it
is
implemented
in
seattle,
and
schenectady,
and
in
albuquerque,
and
in
albany,
we
don't
get
the
views
of
this
court
adequately
indicated.
we
have
here
the
last
vestige
really,
a
full-blown
what
is
i
think
properly
called
institutionalized
mccartneyism.
this
program
almost
without
change,
despite
17
years
of
existence,
for
17
years,
this
court
has
more
or
less
articulated
points
of
view
which
i
could
spell
out
extensively,
but
i
think
need
not
which
are
at
war
with
the
program
of
this
kind,
yet
this
program
in
its
heart
permits
questionnaires
such
as
this,
that
is
still
be
asked
in
november
1967,
and
it
does
so,
not
only
because
a
program
of
this
kind
violates
the
concept
to
separation
of
powers
essentially
as
it
does,
because
it
over
delegates,
because
it
may
well
be
a
bill
of
attainder
and
seeks
to
punish
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
an
improper
delegation
to
the
executive,
from
an
overbroad
statute
which
really
causes
--
necessitates
him
to
answer.
i
note
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
simply
urge
this
court
to
view
this
as
a
totality
of
program,
making
it
clear
that
programs
of
this
kind
--
why
in
the
face
of
dealt
needs
of
our
society
in
terms
of
the
maintenance
of
values
that
i
think
we
all
share.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
can
i
just
hand
it
up
to
you
now?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
alright,
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
with
the
court's
permission,
mr.
caughlan
is

you.
mr.

no,
we

the

people,
they
knew
everything
about
schneider
and
they
come
up
with
this
pious
nonsense
that
he
has
to
answer
the
questions
so
they
have
a
basis
to
go
ahead,
that's
simply
factually
false.
they
knew
everything
about
him.
what
they
were
seeking
to
do
is
to
make
him
conform
by
answering
questions
under
oath
that
were
unanswerable.
and
if
there's
any
question
that
this
is
still
what
they're
up,
which
is
what
mr.
brennan
asked,
what
kind
of
question
do
they
ask?
i
have
in
my
hand
a
questionnaire
that
we
received
two
weeks
ago
from
a
man
in
which
they
say,
“in
1949,
were
you
a
member
of
the
progressive
party
of
washington
in
1950
and
1951
and
1952?
did
you
attend
a
bazaar
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
people's
world
for
the
purpose
of
raising
funds?”
they
asked,
“did
you
attend
any
meetings?”
now,
listen,
“did
you
attend
any
meetings
with
an
official
of
the
communist
party,
you
know,
give
dates
and
places
of
such
of
meetings
and
what
officials?”
well,
who
knows
whether
they
attend
meetings
on
and
on
and
on.
and
mister
--
it
is
suggested
by
the
government
that
this
is
relevant
by
a
set
of
standards
that
the
government
adopts
that
this
is
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
character
and
habits
of
this
man
are
inimical
for
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
this
particular
man?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
mr.
schneider
or
the
man
who
got
this?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
mr.
schneider
simply
has
never
managed
to
go
to
sea
for
three
years
despite
his
deep
desire
to
do
so.
he
is
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
that's
right
as,
i
indicated
he
had
decided
in
1964,
when
his
children
were
right
on
age,
so
they
didn't
mind
being
away
from
home
so
much,
that
he
would
ship,
he
has
continued
in
a
land
job
in
which
he
makes
substantially
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
which
he's
had,
and
he's
some
kind
of
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
no.
on
a
private
industry,
just
this,
this
is
a
private
industry.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
now,
this
of
course
--
the
relevance
of
these
questions,
it
seems
to
me
is
critical
and
it
really
gets
to
what
to
me
is
the
heart
of
the
whole
case.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
and
appellant
i
think
agree
about
is
the
high
desirability
that
you
look
at
the
entire
program.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
we've
denied
cert
in
other
case
that's
similar,
have
we
not,
and
there
are
--
mr.
justice
warren
has
asked
questions
about,
“well,
can
we
limit
this
to
the
regulations?
can
we
send
it
back
and
say,
give
the
man
his
hearing?”
i
suggest
to
you
that
implicit,
what
i
tried
to
suggest
yesterday,
implicit
in
the
heart
of
this
program,
is
its
defect.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
is
capable
of
regulating
the
program
that
would
deal
sensitively
with
the
minds
and
hearts
and
feelings
of
people
who
had
to
go
through
this.
i
don't
think
he
is
capable
of
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
separation
of
powers
would
permit
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
device
reasonably
at
least
they've
been
notoriously
unsuccessful,
devise
a
program
that
could
possibly
meet
the
feelings
of
this
court
about
such
matters.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir,
but
the
vice
of
the
matter
and
this
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
i
don't
know
who
ultimately
rights
the
regulation.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
right.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
i
don't
think
constitutionally,
we
reach
beyond
that.
practically
what
happens,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
our
argument
reaches
that,
yes
sir.
and
with
respect
to
that
particular
point,
i
think
this
court
can
easily
decide
this
question
by
simply
saying
and
we
have
read
everything
in
your
library,
mr.
caughlan
and
i,
that
we
can
find,
there
isn't
a
shred
of
a
word
that
suggests
that
in
language
or
otherwise,
a
screening
program,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
nothing
in
the
executive
order.
we
don't
get
a
screening
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
well,
there
was
not
such
a
program
in
world
war
i
as
far
as
i
can
make
out.
if
there
was
a
program
in
world
war
ii,
it
comes
from
some
knowledge
that
is
not
found
in
the
courts
of
this
--
the
library
of
this
court.
now,
it
is
my
knowledge
from
asking
people
not
from
this
that
there
was
a
kind
of
a
program
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
program
there
is
here,
nor
was
it
administered
by
the
coast
guard.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes,
right
[voice
overlap],
yes,
fascinatingly
at
the
time
when
he
was
a
member
of
communist
party.
that's
the
time
when
he
was
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
there
were
some
kind
of
a
very
loose
form
of
screening
program,
but
the
heart
of
this
is
and
to
me
the
heart
of
the
issue
before
this
court
and
it's
this
--
that
this
court
can
and
has
said
many
things
for
many
years
about
programs
of
this
kind
and
i
need
to
reiterate
this
court's
decision.
and
this
court
recognizes
they
are
multiple
ways
in
which
you
can
decide
this
question,
but
is
this
a
proper
occasion,
this
kind
of
a
case,
for
the
exercise
of
judicial
limitation?
i
suggest
not
and
i
suggest
not
because
the
central
problem
of
our
society
it
seems
to
me
is
not
that
this
court
does
not
articulate
magnificently
what
the
constitution
is
all
about.
that
isn't
our
problem.
the
problem
is
that
it
is
implemented
in
seattle,
and
schenectady,
and
in
albuquerque,
and
in
albany,
we
don't
get
the
views
of
this
court
adequately
indicated.
we
have
here
the
last
vestige
really,
a
full-blown
what
is
i
think
properly
called
institutionalized
mccartneyism.
this
program
almost
without
change,
despite
17
years
of
existence,
for
17
years,
this
court
has
more
or
less
articulated
points
of
view
which
i
could
spell
out
extensively,
but
i
think
need
not
which
are
at
war
with
the
program
of
this
kind,
yet
this
program
in
its
heart
permits
questionnaires
such
as
this,
that
is
still
be
asked
in
november
1967,
and
it
does
so,
not
only
because
a
program
of
this
kind
violates
the
concept
to
separation
of
powers
essentially
as
it
does,
because
it
over
delegates,
because
it
may
well
be
a
bill
of
attainder
and
seeks
to
punish
--
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
an
improper
delegation
to
the
executive,
from
an
overbroad
statute
which
really
causes
--
necessitates
him
to
answer.
i
note
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
simply
urge
this
court
to
view
this
as
a
totality
of
program,
making
it
clear
that
programs
of
this
kind
--
why
in
the
face
of
dealt
needs
of
our
society
in
terms
of
the
maintenance
of
values
that
i
think
we
all
share.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
can
i
just
hand
it
up
to
you
now?
mr.
leonard
w.
schroeter
alright,
thank
you.
