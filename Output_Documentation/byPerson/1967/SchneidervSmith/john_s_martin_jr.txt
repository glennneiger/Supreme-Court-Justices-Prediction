mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
view
of
the
war
and
varied
attacks
which
the
appellant
here
has
launched
against
the
statute,
executive
orders
and
regulations
involved,
it's
important
to
know
that
the
outset,
the
exact
procedural
posture
of
this
case
at
the
administrative
level
because
i
think
this
makes
it
clearer,
the
government's
position
as
to
which
issues
are
really
ripe
for
consideration
at
this
time
and
which
we
consider
are
premature.
in
october
of
1964,
the
appellant
applied
for
special
validation
of
his
mariner's
documents.
at
that
time,
he
filled
out
and
submitted
to
the
coast
guard
an
application
and
in
an
answer
to
the
question
concerning
his
activities
in
the
organization
which
had
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general,
each
of
which
was
set
forth
in
the
application
form,
he
responded
as
follows.
the
answer
appears
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
“and
i
have
been
a
member
of
many”,
--
answer,
“i
have
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
including
several
named
on
the
list.
i
cannot
remember
the
names
of
most
of
them”
and
could
not
be
specific
about
any.
to
the
best
of
knowledge,
i
have
not
been
a
member
or
participated
in
the
activities
of
these
organizations
for
10
years.”
that
was
the
extent
of
his
answer
on
this
question.
thereafter,
the
commandant
acting
in
conformity
with
the
regulation
which
provide
that
when
an
application
does
not
provide
sufficient
information
upon
which
he
can
make
a
determination.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
he
requested
additional
information
in
the
form
of
interrogatories.
those
interrogatories
are
set
forth
at
page
34
and
35,
36
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
interrogatories
asked
him
specific
questions,
referred
first
to
his
answer
on
the
original
application
and
asked
him
that's
set
forth
to
list
the
names
of
the
organizations
on
the
list
to
which
he
belonged,
to
furnish
the
dates
of
membership,
and
the
particulars
concerning
his
membership
in
that
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
these
are
organizations
that
were
listed
on
the
questionnaire,
organizations
which
have
on
the
attorney
general's
list
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
organizations
that
were
listed
on
the
questionnaire,
organizations
that
have
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
there
are
a
substantial
number.
but,
again
i
point
out
that
these
were
organizations
--
he
was
not
--
the
organizations
were
set
forth
for
him
so
that
he
could
go
through
them
to
determine
which
organizations
he
might
have
belonged
to
that
were
on
that
list.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
have
not,
i
believe
somebody
figured
--
280
or
290
is
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
very
long
mr.
justice
black
for
this
reason.
i
have
no
idea
at
this
time
how
many
of
these
organizations
he
belonged
to.
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question
--
to
mr.
schroeter
before
or
to
mr.
caughlan
concerning
the
people's
world
he
was
not
asked
to
give
his
opinions
on
the
articles
that
appeared
therein.
he
was
asked
only
--
if
you
look
at
page
35
to
state,
“have
you
ever
subscribed
to
that
paper?”
if
he
answer
is
yes,
give
the
dates.
then
he
was
asked,
“have
you
engaged
in
any
activities
of
behalf
of
that
paper?”
i
take
it
and
i
think
it's
the
only
reasonable
way
to
read
that
question
means
did
you
ever
work
for
it,
did
you
ever
write
for
it,
did
you
ever
act
someway
on
behalf
of
the
paper.
this
is
not
an
answer
that
calls
for
him
to
say
what
he
thought
on
what
appeared
in
it.
now,
it
was
at
this
point
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
fortas.
now,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
--
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
at
the
outset
it's
very
important
to
get
what
we're
involved
with
here
because
the
question
to
which
you
refer
sir
is
the
one
that
is
set
forth
in
the
original
questionnaire
and
that
is,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been,
it's
question
six
at
page
27
--
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
or
affiliated
with
in
any
way
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below?”
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
as
i
read
the
question,
it
says,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
in
any
way
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below?”
then
when
he
answered
that
as
he
did
in
the
answer
that
i
read
to
you
mr.
chief
justice,
the
interrogatories
that
came
back
called
for
him
to
list
the
names
of
the
political
and
social
organizations
to
which
you
belonged
using
the
word
“belonged.”
he
wasn't
asked
at
this
point
whether
he
was
affiliated
with
any
of
these.
so,
that
is
--
these
are
the
questions
that
we
were
dealing
with.
these
are
the
questions
that
he
refused
to
answer,
the
one
set
forth
in
the
interrogatories.
not
--
he
had
answered
the
question
on
the
questionnaire.
the
commandant
felt
that
those
answers
did
not
give
him
enough
information
and
he
then
set
forth
the
interrogatories.
those
are
the
questions
t
which
the
appellant
refused
to
answer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
that
if
you
read
these
interrogatories
the
outset
referred
back
to
the
application
that
he
made
and
he's
being
asked
in
connection
with
those
organizations
to
list
the
names.
now,
i
think
the
other
thing
that
it
is
important
to
recognize
at
the
outset
here
is
the
response
that
was
made
to
this.
the
response
was
not
i
find
these
questions
vague
and
i
cannot
answer
them.
the
response
was
not
that
i
feel
these
questions
would
tend
to
incriminate
me
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
the
question
called
--
the
original
question
called
only
for
his
answer
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
what
the
commandant
was
interested
in
obtaining
and
what
he
meant
and
i
think
the
interrogatories
indicate,
they're
referring
back
to
question
six,
and
that
that's
the
type
of
information
that
they're
looking
for.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
they
appear
only
in
his
answer.
it
says,
are
you
--
question
six
says
only,
“are
you
now,
have
you
ever
been
a
member
or
affiliated
with
the
organization?”
he
chose
to
answer
that
by
referring
to
the
fact
the
political
and
social
--
they
apparently
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
interrogatories,
yes.
these
were
sent
out
in
response
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
--
these
were
sent
out
after
his
application
have
been
screened
and
they
determined
they
want
to
find
out
this
additional
information
and
it
was
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
i
believe
that
since
these
all
refers
back
to
the
original
question
that
he
was
asked
which
was
strictly
limited
to
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
perhaps
present
in
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
now
going
outside
the
attorney
general's
list.
i
think
that
their
intention
was
to
referring
to
the
organizations
that
they
had
referred
to
in
the
original
question,
and
that
was
really
all
their
interested
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
think
--
i
do
think
i
would
have
read
that
one
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
again
i
don't
think
this
is
the
issue
because
the
response
to
this
was
not
to
the
commandant.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
i
find
it
vague,
the
response
was
as
was
pointed
out
yesterday,
if
mr.
schroeter's
lawyer
would
said,
“i
have
advised
mr.
schneider
that
it
is
possible
for
him
to
answer
the
interrogatories
you
have
sent
him.
so,
the
question
was
not
one,
of
whether
or
not
the
interrogatories
were
vague,
they
would
put
this
man
in
jeopardy
to
answer.
the
question
was
essentially
this
and
i
think
this
is
the
issue
that
is
certainly
we
do
not
intend
that
anything
other
than
right
to
consideration
by
this
court.
that
is
when
the
government
adopts
a
program,
a
screening
program
for
an
area
which
it
considers
to
be
essential
to
the
national
defense
effort,
does
the
government
at
that
time
have
the
right
to
ask
an
applicant
for
such
position
about
his
past
associations.
do
they
have
a
right
to
inquire?
now,
i
think
in
treating
this
question,
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
does
become
important
because
he
is
not
--
these
questions
are
asked
not
obtain
answers
which
will
then
per
se
exclude
him
from
employment.
they
are
the
starting
point
of
an
investigation.
this
is
the
same
as
with
any
application
for
any
type
of
employment,
for
any
type
of
clearance,
this
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
about
government
employees
in
this
case
but
i
do
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
a
second
assistant
engineer.
i
think
that
was
--
he
was
qualified
for
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
mariner's
document
is
basically
one
that
relates
to
technical
ability
[voice
overlap]
that
he
is
--
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
is
qualified
as
a
second
assistant
engineer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
basically
what
we
were
involved
in
here
a
determination
by
congress
that
our
maritime
industry
is
a
vital
part
of
our
national
defense
effort.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
our
experience
in
the
two
world
wars
we've
had
clearly
indicates
how
important
the
maritime
industry
is
to
the
free
flow
of
raw
materials
in
time
of
national
emergency.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
doubted.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
what
can
be
asked
of
an
individual
for
employment
of
any
industry
which
is
determined
to
be
an
industry
which
is
involved
into
our
national
defense
are
questions
that
are
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
individual
is
going
to
use
that
position
in
a
way
that
will
be
inimical
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
has
to
be
a
standard
of
relevance.
i
think
that
is
the
determination
that
has
to
be
made.
i
think
that
certainly
--
in
monday's
decisions
in
the
robel
case
that
this
court
recognized
that
the
government
does
have
the
right
to
exclude
from
sensitive
areas,
those
who
would
use
their
positions
in
those
areas
--
adverse
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
question
then
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
would
agree
with
you
that
there
are
limitations.
i
think
that
there
are
limitations
in
the
questions
that
can
be
asked
and
the
procedures
that
must
be
followed.
i
think
this
court
made
that
clear
in
robel.
you
cannot
just
adopt
the
rule
that
says,
some
particular
membership
of
a
particular
organizations
going
to
exclude
you
from
such
a
job.
you
have
to
have
a
procedure
which
will
as
you
have
here
which
will
allow
the
party
to
see
what
the
charges
are
against
him,
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him,
and
to
have
an
opportunity
to
explain,
to
indicate
what
the
extent
of
his
membership
was.
but
i
do
think
that
a
relevant
starting
a
point
for
this
type
of
investigation
is
membership
in
organizations
which
has
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general
according
with
--
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
securities
activities
control
act.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
with
regard
to
your
first
question
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
ambiguous
and
i
think
that
that
was
not
the
response
that
was
made.
two,
if
that
is
the
case,
the
remedy
here
is
not
the
remedy
that
this
petitioner
asks
for,
but
to
remand
the
case
with
directions
for
the
commandant
to
limit
his
questions
to
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
with
regard
to
your
second
part
of
your
question,
i
do
think
that
contributions
and
number
of
meetings
are
relevant
considerations.
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
that
people
can
innocently
belong
to
such
organizations
without
knowing
the
full
extent
of
the
organizations
activities.
how
do
you
determine
what
person
belongs
innocently
and
what
person
belongs
with
full
knowledge
of
the
organization's
activities.
you
have
to
determine
the
extent
of
his
participation.
did
he
only
attend
one
or
two
meetings?
what
do
you
know
--
what
does
the
government
know
about
the
meetings
that
he
attended?
maybe
that
there
were
a
number
of
meetings
held
by
these
organizations
that
did
not
reveal
their
illegal
purposes.
there
maybe
certain
meetings
of
this
organization
that
did
reveal
fully
in
which
the
participants
at
those
meetings
set
forth
the
full
extent
of
the
organization's
purpose
and
activities.
the
government
can't
make
a
reasonable
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
fact
of
membership
should
preclude
this
man
from
the
employment
which
he
seeks
unless
they
know
the
full
extent
of
his
participation
in
the
organization,
and
how
he
feels
and
felt
at
the
time
about
that
organization's
activities.
did
he
subscribe
to
the
purpose
of
the
communist
party
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?
if
he
did,
then
i
think
that
that
is
a
fact
on
which
you'd
certainly
exclude
him,
if
he
still
retains
that
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
that
is
the
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
those
are
the
language,
that
is
the
language.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
those
standards
have
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
standards
set
forth
in
section
121.03
which
relate
to
the
information
that
maybe
considered
which
are
listed
and
advocacy
which
give
the
nature
of
the
information
that
they're
concerned
with,
advocacy
of
the
overthrow,
or
alterations
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
unconstitutional
means,
commission
of
or
attempts
or
preparations
to
commit
an
act
of
espionage,
sabotage,
sedition
--
sedition
or
treason,
or
conspiring
with,
or
aiding
or
abetting
another
to
commit
such
an
act.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
getting
there
is
this.
i
think
the
standards
do
clarify
what
is
meant
by
inimical
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
case
involving
the
same
statute,
inimical
is
not
a
word
that
does
not
have
meaning
as
back
--
a
word
which
this
court
used
in
aptheker,
in
referring
to
the
activities
that
could
be
governed.
here
again
i
think
the
--
another
important
consideration
that
goes
into
this
entire
consideration
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
standard
which
is
to
be
used
in
conjunction
with
a
procedure
that
provides
for
a
hearing
to
the
applicant
at
which
he
will
be
given
the
right
to
confront
--
first
to
be
notified
for
the
reasons
why
the
commandant
feels
he
should
be
denied
an
application,
a
hearing
at
which
he
will
be
entitled
to
be
present,
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel,
he
will
be
entitled
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him,
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
now,
in
this
connection
it
is
our
position
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
understanding
mr.
justice
black
is
that
those
--
that
after
the
decision
of
this
court
at
the
anti-fascist
refugee
case
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
this
list
does
not
contain
any
organization
that
has
not
been
listed
according
to
the
procedures
adopted
after
the
anti-fascist
refugee
case,
and
that
these
procedures
were
designed
to
comply
what
this
court
said
in
that
case,
that
they
would
provide
procedures
which
gave
the
organization
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
really
sure
as
--
i
believe
that
is
correct
[voice
overlap],
but
the
procedures
were
made
available
to
the
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
admit
that
isn't
in
the
standard,
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
if
there
was
any
confusion
on
that.
i
was
responding
to
a
question
that
asked
him
about
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
--
what
it
means
i
think
is
that
a
party
associates
himself
with
an
organization,
knowing
its
purposes
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that
it
has
to
refer
to
some
type
of
association
with
the
organization.
but
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
this
is
a
determination
that
is
made
and
it
can
be
made
in
conjunction
with
a
hearing.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
question
which
i
think
should
not
--
as
this
court
said,
monday
in
the
dubois
club
case,
it
should
not
be
decided
in
a
vacuum.
it
should
be
decided
in
a
context
where
there
has
been
a
hearing
at
which
the
evidence
has
been
produced
and
which
the
--
the
court
can
then
judge
on
a
factual
record
such
exited
in
the
case
of
the
boyd
v.
roland
which
was
taken
to
the
courts
and
we
do
not
contend
for
a
moment
that
when
this
hearing
is
held
this
man
will
have
an
opportunity
to
take
the
case
to
the
court
and
having
the
action
of
the
commandant
reviewed
judicially.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
i
definitely
would
stress
again.
i
mean
that
is
the
real
question
here
for
decision.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
the
issue
i
think
that
is
really
before
the
court,
it's
does
the
government,
when
a
man
comes
to
apply
for
position
which
the
government
believes
is
a
position
in
an
industry
vital
to
the
national
defense,
in
which
some
effort
should
be
made
and
taken
to
protect
that
industry
against
sabotage,
what
can
they
inquire
of
that
individual
for
the
position?
can
they
ask
him
about
his
past
association?
can
man
present
himself
for
such
a
position
and
say,
my
name
is
john
martin
and
i
want
a
job?
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
this
is,
i
think,
a
fairly
standard
form.
i
think
it's
a
form
very
similar
to
one
filled
out
when
i
came
to
the
department
--
i
came
to
the
department
of
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of.
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
exactly
what
the
standards
are
in
the
various
programs
and
how
they
are
administered.
i
do
know
that
there
are
any
number
of
screening
programs
in
various
departments
of
the
government,
in
the
industrial
screening
programs
that
are
used
by
the
defense
department
in
connection
with
defense
related
contracts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
no
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
black.
[laughter]
they
didn't
nor
did
i
inform
them
that
i'd,
at
any
time,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
they
had
no
occasion
to
inquire
further
as
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sure
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
reason
why
the
applicant
should
have
become
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
question
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
give
the
same
answer.
i
think
that
the
question
is,
if
the
man
has
belonged
to
the
communist
party
and
he
has
admitted
that,
the
commandant
is
faced
with
the
determination,
“should
i
make
that
fact
that
he
belonged
to
the
communist
party,
something
that
will
exclude
him
from
employment
or
should
i
not?”
now,
the
only
way
i
can
make
that
determination
is
to
know
--
have
some
idea
as
to
what
the
man's
participation
was,
what
is
the
nature,
and
what
is
his
adherence
to
their
beliefs?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
do
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i
wouldn't
--
that
i
don't
think
he
should
be
required
to
answer
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
my
answer
to
you
is
correct
and
i'm
sure
that
is
probably
just
an
error
that
was
made
in
printing
because
i
thought
--
now
this
is
what
is
the
questionnaire
which
is
set
forth
and
perhaps
the
counsel
might
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
there
might
have
been
some
type
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
there
is
some
language
to
that
nature
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that's
the
joint
appendix
here
and
that
is
where
the
answer
i
read
to
you,
in
the
joint
appendix
which
is
brown
covered
volume.
that's
not
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
a
substantial
difference
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
here
again,
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
when
he
answered
that
question,
the
question
that
was
then
subsequently
posed
to
him
when
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
decided
the
additional
information
is
to
list
the
question
--
the
organizations
to
which
he
belonged.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
it
is
that
question
which
he
refused
to
answer.
it's
that
question
which
he
says,
they
have
no
right
to
ask.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
his
answer
indicated
that
he
had
some
problem
with
the
question.
the
reply
to
that
was
not
the
answer
to
that
question.
it
was,
tell
us
those
to
which
you
belonged.
that
is
the
question
which
he
did
not
answer.
that
is
the
question
that
the
commandant
is
waiting
to
have
answered.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
--
you
know
i
--
all
i'm
saying
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
entirely
on
that
preposition
that
the
question
is
in
this
man
has
every
right
to
bring
this
question
to
the
court,
is
does
the
commandant
have
the
right
to
require
him
to
answer
the
questions
before
he
passes
on
the
application.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
dubois
has
anything
to
do
with
that
question.
what
i
am
directing
myself
to
is
that
the
appellant
make
several
contentions
that
the
hearing
maybe
inadequate
because
witnesses
against
him
may
not
be
produced.
that
the
standard
--
the
burden
is
going
to
be
cast
on
him
to
prove
that
he
has
a
bad
fifth
amendment
--
a
good
fifth
amendment
character.
i
think
that
these
questions,
the
other
question
is,
that
he
raised
which
i
think
also
is
going
to
be
effective
only
by
a
hearing
is
the
extent
to
which
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
any
other
organization
may
preclude
granting
of
a
special
validation
because
all
of
these
questions
were
going
to
be
developed
at
the
hearing,
i
think
you'll
find
that
after
a
hearing
has
had
that
many
of
these
questions
are
going
to
drop
out
of
the
case.
i
have
been
informed
by
the
coast
guard
that
they
now
take
the
position
that
four
witnesses
will
be
produced
at
the
hearing.
so
that
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
--
the
question
left
open
in
other
case
in
this
court
--
whether
you
can
at
any
time
rely
on
information
not
produced,
will
not
be
a
factor
in
this
case
because
i
feel
that
this
is
an
advice,
that
this
goes
to
a
hearing,
or
witnesses
will
be
produced.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
intended
to
do
that,
but
before
i
do,
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
fact
in
relation
to
the
hearing
and
that
is
that
we
--
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
i
do
think
that
again
this
is
something
that
will
--
if
there
is
a
hearing
in
this
case
that
will
prove
to
be
no
issue
because
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
commandant
has
taken
the
position
that
it
is
the
government's
burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
a
special
validation
should
issued
so
that
--
i
just
--
these
problems
those
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
i
think
that
this
is
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
certainly
man
knows
whether
or
not
he
has
been
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
i've
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
i
have
not
been
a
member
to
any
other
organizations
which
is
affiliated
with
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
if
there
is
problem
with
the
particular
question,
the
answer
is
perhaps
to
attack
a
particular
question
to
say
that
i
cannot
answer
that
and
i
think
if
that
have
been
the
answer
you'd
be
dealing
with
a
different
problem.
this
man
has
said
according
to
his
attorney's
letter
that
he
could've
answered
the
questions,
but
the
government
has
no
right
to
inquire.
so,
that's
why
i
think
we're
not
concerned
here
so
much
with
specificity
of
the
question
because
had
there
been
a
challenge
to
the
specificity
of
the
question,
then
yes
the
commandant
should
have
come
back
and
been
specific
as
he
was
with
the
organization
to
which
he
belonged.
that
is
certain
with
something
that
can
be
handled
administratively
at
that
point.
this
is
a
man
who
just
said
you
have
no
right
to
know.
that's
the
issue.
do
we
have
a
right
to
know?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
he
said
that
in
his
letter
--
mr.
schroeter's
letters
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
said
nothing
to
those.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
answer
came
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
mr.
chief
justice
before
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
i
think
that
the
commandant
does
have
a
right
to
ask
him
to
provide
information
about
himself
which
will
enable
the
commandant
under
take
an
investigation
to
lead
to
the
determination
initially
whether
or
not
the
special
validation
should
be
issued.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
could
initially
deny
it,
at
which
point
if
he
took
that
action
this
man
would
be
entitled
to
the
hearing.
the
man
will
always
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
always
be
entitled
to
judicial
review
except
in
the
cases
where
he
refuses
to
supply
information
which
is
relevant.
that
is
question
before
the
court,
here
again,
i
want
to
stress
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
position
of
the
commandant
is
that
he
cannot
--
the
commandant
cannot
bring
himself
to
a
position
where
he
has
enough
information
about
the
man
to
present
at
a
hearing
until
certain
factors
or
certain
answers
that
are
given
by
the
applicant.
to
use
the
example
i
used
before
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
were
to
show
up
that
the
coast
guard
station,
ask
for
a
special
validation
and
they
--
let's
say,
“my
name
john
martin
and
i
want
a
special
validation”,
and
they
say
well,
you
know,
they
started
asking
me
some
questions,
i
said,
“no,
i
will
not
answer
any
of
your
questions.”
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
reason
for
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
i
think
because
before
the
commandant
can
participate
meaningfully
in
a
hearing,
he
has
to
know
something
about
the
individual
which
will
enable
him
to
determine
to
make
some
findings,
to
gather
evidence
as
to
the
nature
of
this
man's
character.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
then
what
would
happen
at
the
hearing.
this
man
would
come
in
and
he
would
testify
that
i
am
a
person,
his
counsel
has
represented,
that
mr.
schneider,
i'm
a
loyal
person
in
the
united
states.
the
commandant
is
in
no
position
at
that
point,
having
no
information
about
the
man
to
contest
that
fact
this
purpose
of
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
does
not
want
to
deny
--
he
does
not
want
to
deny
the
man
the
right
to
have
that
hearing.
but
he
does
feel
and
i
think
reasonably
that
before
the
commandant
can
participate
meaningfully
in
the
hearing
as
a
represent
to
the
government
they
have
to
have
some
information
about
the
individual
because
all
the
hearing
would
come
out
to
as
this
man
coming
in
and
say,
"i'm
a
person
loyal
to
the
united
states”.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
assumed
that
if
he
is
not
going
to
answer
questions
about
his
--
this
is
the
assumption
in
which
the
regulations
have
based,
that
if
a
man
is
not
going
to
furnish
the
information
that
they
need
to
make
the
determination
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
hope
--
let
me
try
to
make
myself
clear
on
that.
i
do
think
that
this
action
is
properly
brought
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
commandant
had
the
right
to
ask
the
questions
and
require
this
man
to
answer
those
questions.
if
this
court
determines
that
the
first
amendment
gives
a
man
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
about
his
past
associations
even
when
he
is
applying
for
a
position
in
national
defense
related
industry,
certainly
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
the
only
thing
that
i
said
about
the
hearing
is
that
certain
other
arguments
which
he
made
concerning
what
is
going
to
take
place
at
the
hearing.
should
he
wait
the
hearing?
we
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
he
had
absolute
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
determination
not
to
proceed
further
with
the
application.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
have
--
we
do
not
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
any
aspect
to
hear
if
the
case
relating
to
the
question,
can
the
commandant
require
a
man
to
answer
questions
about
his
past
affiliations?
what
we
said
that
it
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
his
answer
was
contained
on
his
attorney's
letter
when
he
said
we
had
no
right
--
the
commandant
had
no
right
to
ask
the
questions.
the
commandant
insists
that
he
does
have
the
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
that
certainly
the
remedy,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
this,
that
this
manner
is
--
that
the
commandant
did
not
have
the
right
to
ask
--
withhold
the
action
and
in
receipt
of
his
answer
just
to
order
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
it's
to
grant
him
the
application
which
he
seeks
which
is
the
relief
he
sought
in
the
district
court,
but
i
do
think
that
would
be
the
proper
remedy
in
that
case.
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
concede
that
much,
no
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
feel
that
--
the
question
that
he
dispose
is
does
the
commandant
have
a
right
to
ask
these
questions
and
get
these
answers?
this
man
said
no.
it's
our
position
that
the
commandant
does
have
a
right
to
ask
questions
concerning
the
organizations
on
this
list.
now,
it
maybe
that
a
particular
question
could
be
more
precise,
it
might
be
proper
to
order
that
a
question
be
made
more
specific
if
the
commandant
insists
on
an
answer
to
that.
but
if
there
are
certain
questions
which
are
quite
precise
what
organizations
did
the
man
belonged
to?
now,
he
just
said
that
we
had
no
right
to
ask
any
of
these
questions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
certainly
that
particular
question
is
not
precise
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
basic
question
started
with
the
first
one
which
asked
him
initially
about
the
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list
and
then
the
first
question
on
the
interrogatory
which
asked
him
which
organizations
he
belonged
to,
i
think
that's
the
basic
question.
i
think
that
this
is
an
answer
--
this
is
a
question
to
which
the
commandant
has
the
right
to
expect
an
answer
so
that
he
can
make
the
reasonable
investigation
of
this
man
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
special
validation
should
be
issued.
i
think
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
now,
i
would
like
if
i
my
at
this
point
to
turn
briefly
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
concerning
the
delegation
of
a
power
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
magnuson
act
authorized
this
type
of
program
that
we
have
here.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
did.
i
think
the
congress
was
acting.
unfortunately
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
because
this
was
an
amendment
to
existing
legislation
that
was
passed
during
the
korean
crises,
but
there
is
some
history
which
i
think
is
significant.
this
is
an
act
which
was
passed
amending
existing
legislation
and
under
to
that
existing
legislation
there
had
been
during
world
war
ii,
screening
program
from
merchant
seaman
which
had
been
enforced.
at
the
time
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate,
senator
magnuson
informed
the
senate
that
the
purpose
of
this
bill
was
to
allow
the
president
to
institute
security
measures
similar
to
those
adopted
during
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii.
so
i
think
that
fact
indicates
that
congress
contemplated
some
type
of
screening
procedure
similar
to
that
used
during
world
war
ii.
second,
i
think
that
in
the
use
of
the
words,
the
president
has
delegated
the
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations,
to
prevent
sabotage
and
espionage.
how
do
you
--
what
rules
and
regulations
do
you
adopt,
why
does
the
common
sense
meaning
of
those
phrases
when
put
together.
it
seems
that
to
prevent
sabotage
and
espionage,
you
have
to
do
two
things.
you
have
to
deny
access
to
those
places
that
maybe
subject
to
those
activities;
one,
to
the
people
who
might
engaged
in
it
and
two;
to
the
materials
that
might
be
used
to
carry
out
those
activities.
so,
i
think
that
just
on
a
reading
of
the
language
that
it
contemplates
that
rules
and
regulations
are
going
to
be
adopted
to
exclude
people
from
areas
where
sabotage
and
espionage
could
be
engaged
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
i
do
have
somewhat
difficulty
with
it.
i
think
it
may
come
into
this
statute
in
view
of
the
fact
that
again
we're
dealing
now,
a
paragraph
to
which
you
refer
is
the
beginning
of
the
amending
legislation.
they
were
concerned.
they
were
adopting
an
amendment
that
maybe
that
they
would
refer
back
to
types
of
rules
and
regulations
that
could've
been
adopted
under
the
first
part,
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there's
some
indication
that
it
was
because
as
i
pointed
out
that
this
is
the
type
of
procedure
that
have
been
used
during
world
war
ii.
that's
what
they
were
driving
at.
they're
trying
to
give
the
power
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
it
can
take
on
some
meaning
from
the
fact
that
this
is
what
they
were
doing
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
in
this
original
act
and
it
was
something
that
was
brought
to
the
congress'
attention.
i
think
this
also
gives
meaning
and
the
counsel
correctly
pointed
out,
and
i
will
apologize
for
briefly
not
making
clear
enough
the
fact
that
--
we
referred
you
to
the
fact
that
the
president
was
also
given
a
power
to
exclude
people
from
vessels
that
was
in
connection
here
in
subsection
(a)
which
dealt
with
the
foreign
vessels
in
our
waters,
but
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
there
is
none.
i'm
just
--
i
can't
be
sure
of
--
i
don't
recall
any.
but
i
do
think
that
when
the
president
was
given
the
power
to
exclude
persons
from
vessels
of
foreign
nations
in
our
waters,
it's
implicit
and
that
is
that
congress
recognized
that
he
would
certainly
have
at
least
that
power
and
draw
the
powers
when
dealing
with
our
own
merchant
marines
which
is
much
more
vital
to
our
national
defense
and
to
which
our
power
is
so
much
greater
to
regulate.
we
must
have
greater
power
to
regulate
our
own
shipping
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
intent
of
congress,
it's
to
give
the
president
the
power
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right,
they
also
think
that
they
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
again
several
factors
are
there
on
that,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
read
your
--
the
decision
of
the
court
very
carefully
in
the
robel.
i
do
think
there
are
many
factors
that
distinguish
this
case.
the
most
particular
being,
if
one
that
--
this
is
not
as
in
robel
case,
we're
dealing
with
the
screening
program
and
not
a
criminal
statute
itself,
but
more
importantly
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
must
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
find
it
--
although
(inaudible)
the
opinions
favorable
to
themselves
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes
and
but
i
do
think
that
an
important
consideration
is
that
you
don't
have
here
what
you
had
in
greene
v.
mcelroy.
we
contend
and
submit
that
the
procedure
is
established
here,
for
processing
these
applications
do
mean
that
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment,
to
that
reason
that
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
type
of
problem
that
you
had
in
robel
where
there
are
no
procedures
and
i
think
your
opinion
makes
it
clear
because
you're
feeling
there
was
no
review
available
in
any
way,
whereas
here,
we
do
have
a
hearing
procedure
which
does
mean,
we
submit,
that
requirements
of
due
process,
and
the
--
from
which
there
will
be
an
adequate
opportunity
before
this
appellant
to
pursue
his
judicial
remedies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
they
have
a
right
--
certainly,
to
inquire
of
a
man
concerning
the
activities
during
his
adult
life.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
certain
now
--
not
to
preclude
him
sir
from
the
activity,
but
as
a
starting
point
for
an
investigation,
these
are
questions
which
i
think
--
somebody
comes
looking
for
employment
and
you
want
to
see
if
he
is
qualified
for
that
employment
for
a
reason,
you
have
to
deal
with
his
past
life
and
what
part's
of
his
past
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
it
certainly
goes
back
for
a
reasonable
time.
now
if
the
man
is
80
years
old
and
maybe
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
the
--
they
have
the
right
to
ask
what
those
organizations
were
so
they
can
pursue
the
investigation
and
determine
among
other
things,
the
truthfulness
and
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
would
–
again,
i
just
point
out
that
these
are
our
--
when
you
read
the
question
[voice
overlap]
referring
back
to
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
always
considered
--
i
never
consider
church
of
a
social
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
that
term
were
used
in
a
vacuum
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan
that
would
be
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
that's
a
matter
of
reading
the
question
that
might
have
been
--
the
prime
question
which
i
can
argue
about.
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
is
what
you
think
is
the
defect
in
this
case,
again,
the
remedy
is
one
that
the
commandant
to
correct
the
form
,
it's
not
to
either
--
you
know,
to
grant
him
the
license
--
the
validation
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
am
having
--
to
be
honest
your
honor,
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
with
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
agree
that
they
can
be
--
i
certainly
agree
that
they
can
be
broad
areas
in
which
you
can
inquire
to
our
contention
in
this
case
that
were
ruminated
to
the
what
we
feel
and
i
understand
if
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
court
with
our
reading
of
that
question,
that
when
you're
limiting
your
inquiry
to
organizations
that
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
were
that
list
is
being
used
is
not
per
se
to
exclude
the
person,
but
solely
for
the
purpose
of
starting
an
investigation
which
will
lead
eventually
to
determination,
whether
or
not
that
person
is
presently
qualified,
and
he
presently
presents
possible
danger
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances,
certainly
the
inquiry
is
reasonable.
i
would
agree
wholeheartedly
that
if
a
question
that
was
asked,
you
know
what
church
do
you
belonged
to,
is
not
a
proper
matter
of
inquiry
in
this.
but
i
do
think,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
organizations
here
involved
and
limited
to
that,
that
that
is
a
proper
starting
point
for
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
believe
that
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
black
and
to
a
certain
extent
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
reasonable
starting
place.
the
attorney
general
has
made
some
investigation.
he
has
made
a
determination
as
an
agent
of
the
government,
that
these
organizations
are
organizations
which
have
engaged
in
acts
which
are
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
a
manner
which
would
be
unconstitutional
or
they
have
their
purposes
for
such
activity.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
you
have
--
i
can't
say
that
it
doesn't
carry
with
it
some
proof
of
fact
that
this
is
a
reasonable
starting
place
for
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
approve
the
list.
i
think
what
you
have
to
approve
is
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
for
the
commandant
to
use
this
list
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
can
vary
on
the
use
which
that
information
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
if
the
government
is
going
to
make
a
determination
that
a
person
is
--
is
or
is
not
someone
who
would
jeopardize
the
interest
of
the
government,
if
you're
allowed
to
be
a
sensitive
position,
it
has
to
determine
some
method
and
arriving
on
its
conclusion
that
he
is
or
is
not
person
who
would
use
that
position
improperly.
it
has
to
look
to
his
past
activity
and
has
to
make
some
judgment
on
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
what
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
form
certain
standards
as
to
what
past
activities
might
provide
on
this
person's
present
character
and
if
it
determines
whether
or
not
by
means
of
a
published
list
or
anything
else,
if
the
government
initially
determines
that
certain
activities
and
certain
organizations
are
engaged
in
activities
which
are
engaged
in
errands
to
unconstitutionally
overthrow
our
government,
then
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
want
to
believe
in
this,
but
i
think
the
difference
between
this
is
to
whether
or
not
how
there
--
if
they
are
using
it
to
prove,
they're
not.
our
contention
is
that
they
are
using
this
as
a
starting
point
of
an
investigation,
and
when
they
go
through
that
investigation
and
come
to
a
hearing,
if
they
say
to
this
appellant
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
abc
organization
which
is
designated
by
the
attorney
general's
as
that
being
communist
action
organization
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
fine.
he
is
still
going
to
have
the
opportunity
at
that
point.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but,
i
think
the
important
thing
mr.
justice
black
is
that
if
--
when
they
say
to
him,
because
that
organization
is
listed
by
whoever
you
wanted
to
say
listed,
he's
got
the
right
to
commend
at
a
hearing
and
say
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
--
again
we're
in
--
i
just
don't
believe
that
the
government
is
using
it.
i'm
saying
they're
taking
this
as
a
starting
point
to
the
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
no
--
i'm
saying
that
we
have
made
our
investigation
on
this
organization
and
we
find
that
he
is
engaged
in
activities
which
if
you
were
part
of
would
indicate
to
us
that
you
are
not
the
type
of
person
who
can
be
granted
a
sensitive
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
bill
of
attainder.
i
can't
assume
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
find
it
impossible
to
take
your
assumption.
i
don't
think
it
is
because
what
you're
dealing
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
assume
something
as
a
bill
of
attainder
when
what
you're
doing
is
trying
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
can't
answer
on
that
assumption.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
attorney
general's
list
is
a
bill
of
attainder?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
it's
still
can
be
--
could
be
used
because
i
think
that
--
again,
we're
looking
towards
a
present
determination
of
a
character
of
a
particular
man.
there
is
no
other
way
you
can
tell
than
by
looking
at
his
past
acts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i'm
saying
this.
i've
find
difficulty
with
your
assumption
to
begin
with
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
say
that
the
government
has
to
do
something.
the
man
has
presented
himself
to
be
issued
a
special
validation.
what
is
the
government
to
do?
it's
got
to
investigate
the
man.
it
has
got
to
look
to
his
past
activities
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely,
i
would
disagree
with
you.
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
couldn't
be
used,
but
i
think
the
government
has
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
for
this
purpose,
i
think
the
government
has
to
make
its
investigation
of
two
things.
one,
what
activities
first,
indicate
that
a
man
belonged
to
them
and
participated
in
them
would
be
a
danger
to
the
government.
now,
whether
they
do
that
by
a
published
attorney
general's
list
whether
they
take
that
action
on
their
own
which
is
circulated
to
the
department
--
by
an
agency
in
government
makes
an
investigation
and
says
that
we
have
determined
from
our
investigation
that
these
organizations
are
engaged
in
unconstitutional
efforts
to
overthrow
the
government.
with
that,
they
had
then
made
the
determination
that
there
are
certain
activities
that
a
man
if
he's
engaged
in
unknowingly,
make
it
quite
likely,
that
he
is
not
the
type
of
person
who
should
be
granted
access
to
any
sensitive
position.
the
next
part
of
the
investigation
is
to
look
--
to
see
if
this
man
belonged
to
that
type
of
organization
and
if
he
did,
what
was
the
extent
of
his
participation
in
them?
then
you
can
come
to
the
fact
where
you
inform
the
man
that
we
have
come
to
a
determination
that
you
belong
to
these
organizations
which
we
believe
are
acting
in
a
manner
that
would
--
to
take
unconstitutional
action
to
overthrow
our
government,
and
for
that
reason
you
should
be
denied
your
special
validation.
at
that
point
he's
got
the
right
to
come
back
in
and
say,
one
of
--
several
things.
one,
i
don't
belonged;
two,
i
belonged,
i
did
not
know
of
its
activities;
three,
i
belonged
knowing
full
well
of
its
activities
and
you
are
all
wrong
because
that
is
not
the
activity
to
be
engaged
in,
and
if
he's
got
an
act
--
if
they're
not
engaged
at
any
unconstitutional
activity,
and
he's
got
a
right
to
litigate
those
issues.
so
i
don't
think
viewing
the
entire
process
that
the
question
of
where
you
start
is
necessarily
determined.
i
think
the
government
has
the
right
to
start
at
some
way.
they
have
made
--
the
government
has
made
the
investigation
and
has
determined
in
its
mind,
that
at
least
by
face
these
organizations
are
engaged
to
the
activities
designed
overthrow
the
government.
and
i
think
that
they
can
use
that
as
the
starting
point
to
investigate
an
individual's
activity
to
determine
whether
he
should
be
granted
the
access
to
any
sensitive
position
that
he
seeks.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
would
have
to
answer
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
i
don't
think
that
is
what
is
the
court's
question
is
directed
to.
it's
whether
you're
affiliated
with
the
organization.
it
doesn't
say
in
that
context,
are
you
affiliated
with
an
organization
that
is
somehow
affiliated
with
that,
because
you
were
putting
it
with
that
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
questions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
question
propounded
by
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
when
you're
talking
about
--
certainly
that
question
is
phrased
in
--
if
you're
talking
about
the
communist
party,
it's
phrased,
“are
you
affiliated
with
an
organization?”
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
if
that
question
had
been
asked
with
respect
to
the
church
group,
the
christian
group
that
you
mention
then
i
suppose
of
that
question
would
call
for
the
answer,
yes.
i
think
that
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
is
a
question
i
do
not
have
to
answer,
because
it
deals
with
my
religious
affiliation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
you
know
i
think
that
there
are
questions
that
can
legitimately
be
asked
and
which
a
person
can
be
expected
to
answer,
that
there
are
certainly
there
areas
which
go
beyond,
but
i
don't
think
that's
we're
faced
within
this
case,
and
that
is
a
position
that
government
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
view
of
the
war
and
varied
attacks
which
the
appellant
here
has
launched
against
the
statute,
executive
orders
and
regulations
involved,
it's
important
to
know
that
the
outset,
the
exact
procedural
posture
of
this
case
at
the
administrative
level
because
i
think
this
makes
it
clearer,
the
government's
position
as
to
which
issues
are
really
ripe
for
consideration
at
this
time
and
which
we
consider
are
premature.
in
october
of
1964,
the
appellant
applied
for
special
validation
of
his
mariner's
documents.
at
that
time,
he
filled
out
and
submitted
to
the
coast
guard
an
application
and
in
an
answer
to
the
question
concerning
his
activities
in
the
organization
which
had
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general,
each
of
which
was
set
forth
in
the
application
form,
he
responded
as
follows.
the
answer
appears
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
“and
i
have
been
a
member
of
many”,
--
answer,
“i
have
been
a
member
of
many
political
and
social
organizations
including
several
named
on
the
list.
i
cannot
remember
the
names
of
most
of
them”
and
could
not
be
specific
about
any.
to
the
best
of
knowledge,
i
have
not
been
a
member
or
participated
in
the
activities
of
these
organizations
for
10
years.”
that
was
the
extent
of
his
answer
on
this
question.
thereafter,
the
commandant
acting
in
conformity
with
the
regulation
which
provide
that
when
an
application
does
not
provide
sufficient
information
upon
which
he
can
make
a
determination.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
he
requested
additional
information
in
the
form
of
interrogatories.
those
interrogatories
are
set
forth
at
page
34
and
35,
36
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
interrogatories
asked
him
specific
questions,
referred
first
to
his
answer
on
the
original
application
and
asked
him
that's
set
forth
to
list
the
names
of
the
organizations
on
the
list
to
which
he
belonged,
to
furnish
the
dates
of
membership,
and
the
particulars
concerning
his
membership
in
that
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
these
are
organizations
that
were
listed
on
the
questionnaire,
organizations
which
have
on
the
attorney
general's
list
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
organizations
that
were
listed
on
the
questionnaire,
organizations
that
have
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
there
are
a
substantial
number.
but,
again
i
point
out
that
these
were
organizations
--
he
was
not
--
the
organizations
were
set
forth
for
him
so
that
he
could
go
through
them
to
determine
which
organizations
he
might
have
belonged
to
that
were
on
that
list.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
have
not,
i
believe
somebody
figured
--
280
or
290
is
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
very
long
mr.
justice
black
for
this
reason.
i
have
no
idea
at
this
time
how
many
of
these
organizations
he
belonged
to.
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question
--
to
mr.
schroeter
before
or
to
mr.
caughlan
concerning
the
people's
world
he
was
not
asked
to
give
his
opinions
on
the
articles
that
appeared
therein.
he
was
asked
only
--
if
you
look
at
page
35
to
state,
“have
you
ever
subscribed
to
that
paper?”
if
he
answer
is
yes,
give
the
dates.
then
he
was
asked,
“have
you
engaged
in
any
activities
of
behalf
of
that
paper?”
i
take
it
and
i
think
it's
the
only
reasonable
way
to
read
that
question
means
did
you
ever
work
for
it,
did
you
ever
write
for
it,
did
you
ever
act
someway
on
behalf
of
the
paper.
this
is
not
an
answer
that
calls
for
him
to
say
what
he
thought
on
what
appeared
in
it.
now,
it
was
at
this
point
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
fortas.
now,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
--
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
at
the
outset
it's
very
important
to
get
what
we're
involved
with
here
because
the
question
to
which
you
refer
sir
is
the
one
that
is
set
forth
in
the
original
questionnaire
and
that
is,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been,
it's
question
six
at
page
27
--
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
or
affiliated
with
in
any
way
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below?”
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
as
i
read
the
question,
it
says,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
in
any
way
any
of
the
organizations
set
forth
below?”
then
when
he
answered
that
as
he
did
in
the
answer
that
i
read
to
you
mr.
chief
justice,
the
interrogatories
that
came
back
called
for
him
to
list
the
names
of
the
political
and
social
organizations
to
which
you
belonged
using
the
word
“belonged.”
he
wasn't
asked
at
this
point
whether
he
was
affiliated
with
any
of
these.
so,
that
is
--
these
are
the
questions
that
we
were
dealing
with.
these
are
the
questions
that
he
refused
to
answer,
the
one
set
forth
in
the
interrogatories.
not
--
he
had
answered
the
question
on
the
questionnaire.
the
commandant
felt
that
those
answers
did
not
give
him
enough
information
and
he
then
set
forth
the
interrogatories.
those
are
the
questions
t
which
the
appellant
refused
to
answer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
that
if
you
read
these
interrogatories
the
outset
referred
back
to
the
application
that
he
made
and
he's
being
asked
in
connection
with
those
organizations
to
list
the
names.
now,
i
think
the
other
thing
that
it
is
important
to
recognize
at
the
outset
here
is
the
response
that
was
made
to
this.
the
response
was
not
i
find
these
questions
vague
and
i
cannot
answer
them.
the
response
was
not
that
i
feel
these
questions
would
tend
to
incriminate
me
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
the
question
called
--
the
original
question
called
only
for
his
answer
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
what
the
commandant
was
interested
in
obtaining
and
what
he
meant
and
i
think
the
interrogatories
indicate,
they're
referring
back
to
question
six,
and
that
that's
the
type
of
information
that
they're
looking
for.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
they
appear
only
in
his
answer.
it
says,
are
you
--
question
six
says
only,
“are
you
now,
have
you
ever
been
a
member
or
affiliated
with
the
organization?”
he
chose
to
answer
that
by
referring
to
the
fact
the
political
and
social
--
they
apparently
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
interrogatories,
yes.
these
were
sent
out
in
response
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
--
these
were
sent
out
after
his
application
have
been
screened
and
they
determined
they
want
to
find
out
this
additional
information
and
it
was
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
i
believe
that
since
these
all
refers
back
to
the
original
question
that
he
was
asked
which
was
strictly
limited
to
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
perhaps
present
in
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
now
going
outside
the
attorney
general's
list.
i
think
that
their
intention
was
to
referring
to
the
organizations
that
they
had
referred
to
in
the
original
question,
and
that
was
really
all
their
interested
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
think
--
i
do
think
i
would
have
read
that
one
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
again
i
don't
think
this
is
the
issue
because
the
response
to
this
was
not
to
the
commandant.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
i
find
it
vague,
the
response
was
as
was
pointed
out
yesterday,
if
mr.
schroeter's
lawyer
would
said,
“i
have
advised
mr.
schneider
that
it
is
possible
for
him
to
answer
the
interrogatories
you
have
sent
him.
so,
the
question
was
not
one,
of
whether
or
not
the
interrogatories
were
vague,
they
would
put
this
man
in
jeopardy
to
answer.
the
question
was
essentially
this
and
i
think
this
is
the
issue
that
is
certainly
we
do
not
intend
that
anything
other
than
right
to
consideration
by
this
court.
that
is
when
the
government
adopts
a
program,
a
screening
program
for
an
area
which
it
considers
to
be
essential
to
the
national
defense
effort,
does
the
government
at
that
time
have
the
right
to
ask
an
applicant
for
such
position
about
his
past
associations.
do
they
have
a
right
to
inquire?
now,
i
think
in
treating
this
question,
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
does
become
important
because
he
is
not
--
these
questions
are
asked
not
obtain
answers
which
will
then
per
se
exclude
him
from
employment.
they
are
the
starting
point
of
an
investigation.
this
is
the
same
as
with
any
application
for
any
type
of
employment,
for
any
type
of
clearance,
this
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
about
government
employees
in
this
case
but
i
do
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
a
second
assistant
engineer.
i
think
that
was
--
he
was
qualified
for
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
mariner's
document
is
basically
one
that
relates
to
technical
ability
[voice
overlap]
that
he
is
--
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
is
qualified
as
a
second
assistant
engineer.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
basically
what
we
were
involved
in
here
a
determination
by
congress
that
our
maritime
industry
is
a
vital
part
of
our
national
defense
effort.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
our
experience
in
the
two
world
wars
we've
had
clearly
indicates
how
important
the
maritime
industry
is
to
the
free
flow
of
raw
materials
in
time
of
national
emergency.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
doubted.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
what
can
be
asked
of
an
individual
for
employment
of
any
industry
which
is
determined
to
be
an
industry
which
is
involved
into
our
national
defense
are
questions
that
are
relevant
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
individual
is
going
to
use
that
position
in
a
way
that
will
be
inimical
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
has
to
be
a
standard
of
relevance.
i
think
that
is
the
determination
that
has
to
be
made.
i
think
that
certainly
--
in
monday's
decisions
in
the
robel
case
that
this
court
recognized
that
the
government
does
have
the
right
to
exclude
from
sensitive
areas,
those
who
would
use
their
positions
in
those
areas
--
adverse
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
question
then
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
would
agree
with
you
that
there
are
limitations.
i
think
that
there
are
limitations
in
the
questions
that
can
be
asked
and
the
procedures
that
must
be
followed.
i
think
this
court
made
that
clear
in
robel.
you
cannot
just
adopt
the
rule
that
says,
some
particular
membership
of
a
particular
organizations
going
to
exclude
you
from
such
a
job.
you
have
to
have
a
procedure
which
will
as
you
have
here
which
will
allow
the
party
to
see
what
the
charges
are
against
him,
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him,
and
to
have
an
opportunity
to
explain,
to
indicate
what
the
extent
of
his
membership
was.
but
i
do
think
that
a
relevant
starting
a
point
for
this
type
of
investigation
is
membership
in
organizations
which
has
been
listed
by
the
attorney
general
according
with
--
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
securities
activities
control
act.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
with
regard
to
your
first
question
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
ambiguous
and
i
think
that
that
was
not
the
response
that
was
made.
two,
if
that
is
the
case,
the
remedy
here
is
not
the
remedy
that
this
petitioner
asks
for,
but
to
remand
the
case
with
directions
for
the
commandant
to
limit
his
questions
to
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
with
regard
to
your
second
part
of
your
question,
i
do
think
that
contributions
and
number
of
meetings
are
relevant
considerations.
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
that
people
can
innocently
belong
to
such
organizations
without
knowing
the
full
extent
of
the
organizations
activities.
how
do
you
determine
what
person
belongs
innocently
and
what
person
belongs
with
full
knowledge
of
the
organization's
activities.
you
have
to
determine
the
extent
of
his
participation.
did
he
only
attend
one
or
two
meetings?
what
do
you
know
--
what
does
the
government
know
about
the
meetings
that
he
attended?
maybe
that
there
were
a
number
of
meetings
held
by
these
organizations
that
did
not
reveal
their
illegal
purposes.
there
maybe
certain
meetings
of
this
organization
that
did
reveal
fully
in
which
the
participants
at
those
meetings
set
forth
the
full
extent
of
the
organization's
purpose
and
activities.
the
government
can't
make
a
reasonable
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
fact
of
membership
should
preclude
this
man
from
the
employment
which
he
seeks
unless
they
know
the
full
extent
of
his
participation
in
the
organization,
and
how
he
feels
and
felt
at
the
time
about
that
organization's
activities.
did
he
subscribe
to
the
purpose
of
the
communist
party
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?
if
he
did,
then
i
think
that
that
is
a
fact
on
which
you'd
certainly
exclude
him,
if
he
still
retains
that
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
that
is
the
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
those
are
the
language,
that
is
the
language.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
those
standards
have
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
standards
set
forth
in
section
121.03
which
relate
to
the
information
that
maybe
considered
which
are
listed
and
advocacy
which
give
the
nature
of
the
information
that
they're
concerned
with,
advocacy
of
the
overthrow,
or
alterations
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
unconstitutional
means,
commission
of
or
attempts
or
preparations
to
commit
an
act
of
espionage,
sabotage,
sedition
--
sedition
or
treason,
or
conspiring
with,
or
aiding
or
abetting
another
to
commit
such
an
act.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
getting
there
is
this.
i
think
the
standards
do
clarify
what
is
meant
by
inimical
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
case
involving
the
same
statute,
inimical
is
not
a
word
that
does
not
have
meaning
as
back
--
a
word
which
this
court
used
in
aptheker,
in
referring
to
the
activities
that
could
be
governed.
here
again
i
think
the
--
another
important
consideration
that
goes
into
this
entire
consideration
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
standard
which
is
to
be
used
in
conjunction
with
a
procedure
that
provides
for
a
hearing
to
the
applicant
at
which
he
will
be
given
the
right
to
confront
--
first
to
be
notified
for
the
reasons
why
the
commandant
feels
he
should
be
denied
an
application,
a
hearing
at
which
he
will
be
entitled
to
be
present,
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel,
he
will
be
entitled
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him,
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
now,
in
this
connection
it
is
our
position
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
understanding
mr.
justice
black
is
that
those
--
that
after
the
decision
of
this
court
at
the
anti-fascist
refugee
case
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
this
list
does
not
contain
any
organization
that
has
not
been
listed
according
to
the
procedures
adopted
after
the
anti-fascist
refugee
case,
and
that
these
procedures
were
designed
to
comply
what
this
court
said
in
that
case,
that
they
would
provide
procedures
which
gave
the
organization
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
really
sure
as
--
i
believe
that
is
correct
[voice
overlap],
but
the
procedures
were
made
available
to
the
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
admit
that
isn't
in
the
standard,
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
if
there
was
any
confusion
on
that.
i
was
responding
to
a
question
that
asked
him
about
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
--
what
it
means
i
think
is
that
a
party
associates
himself
with
an
organization,
knowing
its
purposes
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that
it
has
to
refer
to
some
type
of
association
with
the
organization.
but
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
this
is
a
determination
that
is
made
and
it
can
be
made
in
conjunction
with
a
hearing.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
question
which
i
think
should
not
--
as
this
court
said,
monday
in
the
dubois
club
case,
it
should
not
be
decided
in
a
vacuum.
it
should
be
decided
in
a
context
where
there
has
been
a
hearing
at
which
the
evidence
has
been
produced
and
which
the
--
the
court
can
then
judge
on
a
factual
record
such
exited
in
the
case
of
the
boyd
v.
roland
which
was
taken
to
the
courts
and
we
do
not
contend
for
a
moment
that
when
this
hearing
is
held
this
man
will
have
an
opportunity
to
take
the
case
to
the
court
and
having
the
action
of
the
commandant
reviewed
judicially.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
i
definitely
would
stress
again.
i
mean
that
is
the
real
question
here
for
decision.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
the
issue
i
think
that
is
really
before
the
court,
it's
does
the
government,
when
a
man
comes
to
apply
for
position
which
the
government
believes
is
a
position
in
an
industry
vital
to
the
national
defense,
in
which
some
effort
should
be
made
and
taken
to
protect
that
industry
against
sabotage,
what
can
they
inquire
of
that
individual
for
the
position?
can
they
ask
him
about
his
past
association?
can
man
present
himself
for
such
a
position
and
say,
my
name
is
john
martin
and
i
want
a
job?
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
this
is,
i
think,
a
fairly
standard
form.
i
think
it's
a
form
very
similar
to
one
filled
out
when
i
came
to
the
department
--
i
came
to
the
department
of
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of.
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
exactly
what
the
standards
are
in
the
various
programs
and
how
they
are
administered.
i
do
know
that
there
are
any
number
of
screening
programs
in
various
departments
of
the
government,
in
the
industrial
screening
programs
that
are
used
by
the
defense
department
in
connection
with
defense
related
contracts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
no
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
black.
[laughter]
they
didn't
nor
did
i
inform
them
that
i'd,
at
any
time,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
they
had
no
occasion
to
inquire
further
as
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sure
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
reason
why
the
applicant
should
have
become
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
question
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
give
the
same
answer.
i
think
that
the
question
is,
if
the
man
has
belonged
to
the
communist
party
and
he
has
admitted
that,
the
commandant
is
faced
with
the
determination,
“should
i
make
that
fact
that
he
belonged
to
the
communist
party,
something
that
will
exclude
him
from
employment
or
should
i
not?”
now,
the
only
way
i
can
make
that
determination
is
to
know
--
have
some
idea
as
to
what
the
man's
participation
was,
what
is
the
nature,
and
what
is
his
adherence
to
their
beliefs?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
do
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
i
wouldn't
--
that
i
don't
think
he
should
be
required
to
answer
certainly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
my
answer
to
you
is
correct
and
i'm
sure
that
is
probably
just
an
error
that
was
made
in
printing
because
i
thought
--
now
this
is
what
is
the
questionnaire
which
is
set
forth
and
perhaps
the
counsel
might
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
there
might
have
been
some
type
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
there
is
some
language
to
that
nature
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that's
the
joint
appendix
here
and
that
is
where
the
answer
i
read
to
you,
in
the
joint
appendix
which
is
brown
covered
volume.
that's
not
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
a
substantial
difference
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
here
again,
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
when
he
answered
that
question,
the
question
that
was
then
subsequently
posed
to
him
when
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
decided
the
additional
information
is
to
list
the
question
--
the
organizations
to
which
he
belonged.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
it
is
that
question
which
he
refused
to
answer.
it's
that
question
which
he
says,
they
have
no
right
to
ask.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
his
answer
indicated
that
he
had
some
problem
with
the
question.
the
reply
to
that
was
not
the
answer
to
that
question.
it
was,
tell
us
those
to
which
you
belonged.
that
is
the
question
which
he
did
not
answer.
that
is
the
question
that
the
commandant
is
waiting
to
have
answered.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
--
you
know
i
--
all
i'm
saying
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
entirely
on
that
preposition
that
the
question
is
in
this
man
has
every
right
to
bring
this
question
to
the
court,
is
does
the
commandant
have
the
right
to
require
him
to
answer
the
questions
before
he
passes
on
the
application.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
dubois
has
anything
to
do
with
that
question.
what
i
am
directing
myself
to
is
that
the
appellant
make
several
contentions
that
the
hearing
maybe
inadequate
because
witnesses
against
him
may
not
be
produced.
that
the
standard
--
the
burden
is
going
to
be
cast
on
him
to
prove
that
he
has
a
bad
fifth
amendment
--
a
good
fifth
amendment
character.
i
think
that
these
questions,
the
other
question
is,
that
he
raised
which
i
think
also
is
going
to
be
effective
only
by
a
hearing
is
the
extent
to
which
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
any
other
organization
may
preclude
granting
of
a
special
validation
because
all
of
these
questions
were
going
to
be
developed
at
the
hearing,
i
think
you'll
find
that
after
a
hearing
has
had
that
many
of
these
questions
are
going
to
drop
out
of
the
case.
i
have
been
informed
by
the
coast
guard
that
they
now
take
the
position
that
four
witnesses
will
be
produced
at
the
hearing.
so
that
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
--
the
question
left
open
in
other
case
in
this
court
--
whether
you
can
at
any
time
rely
on
information
not
produced,
will
not
be
a
factor
in
this
case
because
i
feel
that
this
is
an
advice,
that
this
goes
to
a
hearing,
or
witnesses
will
be
produced.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
intended
to
do
that,
but
before
i
do,
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
fact
in
relation
to
the
hearing
and
that
is
that
we
--
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
i
do
think
that
again
this
is
something
that
will
--
if
there
is
a
hearing
in
this
case
that
will
prove
to
be
no
issue
because
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
commandant
has
taken
the
position
that
it
is
the
government's
burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
a
special
validation
should
issued
so
that
--
i
just
--
these
problems
those
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
i
think
that
this
is
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
certainly
man
knows
whether
or
not
he
has
been
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
i've
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
i
have
not
been
a
member
to
any
other
organizations
which
is
affiliated
with
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
if
there
is
problem
with
the
particular
question,
the
answer
is
perhaps
to
attack
a
particular
question
to
say
that
i
cannot
answer
that
and
i
think
if
that
have
been
the
answer
you'd
be
dealing
with
a
different
problem.
this
man
has
said
according
to
his
attorney's
letter
that
he
could've
answered
the
questions,
but
the
government
has
no
right
to
inquire.
so,
that's
why
i
think
we're
not
concerned
here
so
much
with
specificity
of
the
question
because
had
there
been
a
challenge
to
the
specificity
of
the
question,
then
yes
the
commandant
should
have
come
back
and
been
specific
as
he
was
with
the
organization
to
which
he
belonged.
that
is
certain
with
something
that
can
be
handled
administratively
at
that
point.
this
is
a
man
who
just
said
you
have
no
right
to
know.
that's
the
issue.
do
we
have
a
right
to
know?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes.
he
said
that
in
his
letter
--
mr.
schroeter's
letters
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
said
nothing
to
those.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
answer
came
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
mr.
chief
justice
before
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
i
think
that
the
commandant
does
have
a
right
to
ask
him
to
provide
information
about
himself
which
will
enable
the
commandant
under
take
an
investigation
to
lead
to
the
determination
initially
whether
or
not
the
special
validation
should
be
issued.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
could
initially
deny
it,
at
which
point
if
he
took
that
action
this
man
would
be
entitled
to
the
hearing.
the
man
will
always
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
always
be
entitled
to
judicial
review
except
in
the
cases
where
he
refuses
to
supply
information
which
is
relevant.
that
is
question
before
the
court,
here
again,
i
want
to
stress
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
position
of
the
commandant
is
that
he
cannot
--
the
commandant
cannot
bring
himself
to
a
position
where
he
has
enough
information
about
the
man
to
present
at
a
hearing
until
certain
factors
or
certain
answers
that
are
given
by
the
applicant.
to
use
the
example
i
used
before
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
were
to
show
up
that
the
coast
guard
station,
ask
for
a
special
validation
and
they
--
let's
say,
“my
name
john
martin
and
i
want
a
special
validation”,
and
they
say
well,
you
know,
they
started
asking
me
some
questions,
i
said,
“no,
i
will
not
answer
any
of
your
questions.”
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
reason
for
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
i
think
because
before
the
commandant
can
participate
meaningfully
in
a
hearing,
he
has
to
know
something
about
the
individual
which
will
enable
him
to
determine
to
make
some
findings,
to
gather
evidence
as
to
the
nature
of
this
man's
character.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
then
what
would
happen
at
the
hearing.
this
man
would
come
in
and
he
would
testify
that
i
am
a
person,
his
counsel
has
represented,
that
mr.
schneider,
i'm
a
loyal
person
in
the
united
states.
the
commandant
is
in
no
position
at
that
point,
having
no
information
about
the
man
to
contest
that
fact
this
purpose
of
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
does
not
want
to
deny
--
he
does
not
want
to
deny
the
man
the
right
to
have
that
hearing.
but
he
does
feel
and
i
think
reasonably
that
before
the
commandant
can
participate
meaningfully
in
the
hearing
as
a
represent
to
the
government
they
have
to
have
some
information
about
the
individual
because
all
the
hearing
would
come
out
to
as
this
man
coming
in
and
say,
"i'm
a
person
loyal
to
the
united
states”.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
assumed
that
if
he
is
not
going
to
answer
questions
about
his
--
this
is
the
assumption
in
which
the
regulations
have
based,
that
if
a
man
is
not
going
to
furnish
the
information
that
they
need
to
make
the
determination
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
hope
--
let
me
try
to
make
myself
clear
on
that.
i
do
think
that
this
action
is
properly
brought
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
commandant
had
the
right
to
ask
the
questions
and
require
this
man
to
answer
those
questions.
if
this
court
determines
that
the
first
amendment
gives
a
man
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
about
his
past
associations
even
when
he
is
applying
for
a
position
in
national
defense
related
industry,
certainly
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
the
only
thing
that
i
said
about
the
hearing
is
that
certain
other
arguments
which
he
made
concerning
what
is
going
to
take
place
at
the
hearing.
should
he
wait
the
hearing?
we
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
he
had
absolute
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
determination
not
to
proceed
further
with
the
application.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
have
--
we
do
not
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
any
aspect
to
hear
if
the
case
relating
to
the
question,
can
the
commandant
require
a
man
to
answer
questions
about
his
past
affiliations?
what
we
said
that
it
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
his
answer
was
contained
on
his
attorney's
letter
when
he
said
we
had
no
right
--
the
commandant
had
no
right
to
ask
the
questions.
the
commandant
insists
that
he
does
have
the
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
that
certainly
the
remedy,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
this,
that
this
manner
is
--
that
the
commandant
did
not
have
the
right
to
ask
--
withhold
the
action
and
in
receipt
of
his
answer
just
to
order
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
it's
to
grant
him
the
application
which
he
seeks
which
is
the
relief
he
sought
in
the
district
court,
but
i
do
think
that
would
be
the
proper
remedy
in
that
case.
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
concede
that
much,
no
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
feel
that
--
the
question
that
he
dispose
is
does
the
commandant
have
a
right
to
ask
these
questions
and
get
these
answers?
this
man
said
no.
it's
our
position
that
the
commandant
does
have
a
right
to
ask
questions
concerning
the
organizations
on
this
list.
now,
it
maybe
that
a
particular
question
could
be
more
precise,
it
might
be
proper
to
order
that
a
question
be
made
more
specific
if
the
commandant
insists
on
an
answer
to
that.
but
if
there
are
certain
questions
which
are
quite
precise
what
organizations
did
the
man
belonged
to?
now,
he
just
said
that
we
had
no
right
to
ask
any
of
these
questions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
certainly
that
particular
question
is
not
precise
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
basic
question
started
with
the
first
one
which
asked
him
initially
about
the
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list
and
then
the
first
question
on
the
interrogatory
which
asked
him
which
organizations
he
belonged
to,
i
think
that's
the
basic
question.
i
think
that
this
is
an
answer
--
this
is
a
question
to
which
the
commandant
has
the
right
to
expect
an
answer
so
that
he
can
make
the
reasonable
investigation
of
this
man
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
special
validation
should
be
issued.
i
think
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
now,
i
would
like
if
i
my
at
this
point
to
turn
briefly
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
concerning
the
delegation
of
a
power
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
magnuson
act
authorized
this
type
of
program
that
we
have
here.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
did.
i
think
the
congress
was
acting.
unfortunately
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
because
this
was
an
amendment
to
existing
legislation
that
was
passed
during
the
korean
crises,
but
there
is
some
history
which
i
think
is
significant.
this
is
an
act
which
was
passed
amending
existing
legislation
and
under
to
that
existing
legislation
there
had
been
during
world
war
ii,
screening
program
from
merchant
seaman
which
had
been
enforced.
at
the
time
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate,
senator
magnuson
informed
the
senate
that
the
purpose
of
this
bill
was
to
allow
the
president
to
institute
security
measures
similar
to
those
adopted
during
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii.
so
i
think
that
fact
indicates
that
congress
contemplated
some
type
of
screening
procedure
similar
to
that
used
during
world
war
ii.
second,
i
think
that
in
the
use
of
the
words,
the
president
has
delegated
the
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations,
to
prevent
sabotage
and
espionage.
how
do
you
--
what
rules
and
regulations
do
you
adopt,
why
does
the
common
sense
meaning
of
those
phrases
when
put
together.
it
seems
that
to
prevent
sabotage
and
espionage,
you
have
to
do
two
things.
you
have
to
deny
access
to
those
places
that
maybe
subject
to
those
activities;
one,
to
the
people
who
might
engaged
in
it
and
two;
to
the
materials
that
might
be
used
to
carry
out
those
activities.
so,
i
think
that
just
on
a
reading
of
the
language
that
it
contemplates
that
rules
and
regulations
are
going
to
be
adopted
to
exclude
people
from
areas
where
sabotage
and
espionage
could
be
engaged
in.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
i
do
have
somewhat
difficulty
with
it.
i
think
it
may
come
into
this
statute
in
view
of
the
fact
that
again
we're
dealing
now,
a
paragraph
to
which
you
refer
is
the
beginning
of
the
amending
legislation.
they
were
concerned.
they
were
adopting
an
amendment
that
maybe
that
they
would
refer
back
to
types
of
rules
and
regulations
that
could've
been
adopted
under
the
first
part,
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there's
some
indication
that
it
was
because
as
i
pointed
out
that
this
is
the
type
of
procedure
that
have
been
used
during
world
war
ii.
that's
what
they
were
driving
at.
they're
trying
to
give
the
power
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
it
can
take
on
some
meaning
from
the
fact
that
this
is
what
they
were
doing
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
in
this
original
act
and
it
was
something
that
was
brought
to
the
congress'
attention.
i
think
this
also
gives
meaning
and
the
counsel
correctly
pointed
out,
and
i
will
apologize
for
briefly
not
making
clear
enough
the
fact
that
--
we
referred
you
to
the
fact
that
the
president
was
also
given
a
power
to
exclude
people
from
vessels
that
was
in
connection
here
in
subsection
(a)
which
dealt
with
the
foreign
vessels
in
our
waters,
but
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
there
is
none.
i'm
just
--
i
can't
be
sure
of
--
i
don't
recall
any.
but
i
do
think
that
when
the
president
was
given
the
power
to
exclude
persons
from
vessels
of
foreign
nations
in
our
waters,
it's
implicit
and
that
is
that
congress
recognized
that
he
would
certainly
have
at
least
that
power
and
draw
the
powers
when
dealing
with
our
own
merchant
marines
which
is
much
more
vital
to
our
national
defense
and
to
which
our
power
is
so
much
greater
to
regulate.
we
must
have
greater
power
to
regulate
our
own
shipping
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
intent
of
congress,
it's
to
give
the
president
the
power
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right,
they
also
think
that
they
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
again
several
factors
are
there
on
that,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
i
read
your
--
the
decision
of
the
court
very
carefully
in
the
robel.
i
do
think
there
are
many
factors
that
distinguish
this
case.
the
most
particular
being,
if
one
that
--
this
is
not
as
in
robel
case,
we're
dealing
with
the
screening
program
and
not
a
criminal
statute
itself,
but
more
importantly
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
must
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
find
it
--
although
(inaudible)
the
opinions
favorable
to
themselves
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes
and
but
i
do
think
that
an
important
consideration
is
that
you
don't
have
here
what
you
had
in
greene
v.
mcelroy.
we
contend
and
submit
that
the
procedure
is
established
here,
for
processing
these
applications
do
mean
that
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment,
to
that
reason
that
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
type
of
problem
that
you
had
in
robel
where
there
are
no
procedures
and
i
think
your
opinion
makes
it
clear
because
you're
feeling
there
was
no
review
available
in
any
way,
whereas
here,
we
do
have
a
hearing
procedure
which
does
mean,
we
submit,
that
requirements
of
due
process,
and
the
--
from
which
there
will
be
an
adequate
opportunity
before
this
appellant
to
pursue
his
judicial
remedies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
they
have
a
right
--
certainly,
to
inquire
of
a
man
concerning
the
activities
during
his
adult
life.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
certain
now
--
not
to
preclude
him
sir
from
the
activity,
but
as
a
starting
point
for
an
investigation,
these
are
questions
which
i
think
--
somebody
comes
looking
for
employment
and
you
want
to
see
if
he
is
qualified
for
that
employment
for
a
reason,
you
have
to
deal
with
his
past
life
and
what
part's
of
his
past
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
it
certainly
goes
back
for
a
reasonable
time.
now
if
the
man
is
80
years
old
and
maybe
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that
the
--
they
have
the
right
to
ask
what
those
organizations
were
so
they
can
pursue
the
investigation
and
determine
among
other
things,
the
truthfulness
and
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
would
–
again,
i
just
point
out
that
these
are
our
--
when
you
read
the
question
[voice
overlap]
referring
back
to
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
always
considered
--
i
never
consider
church
of
a
social
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
that
term
were
used
in
a
vacuum
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan
that
would
be
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
that's
a
matter
of
reading
the
question
that
might
have
been
--
the
prime
question
which
i
can
argue
about.
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
is
what
you
think
is
the
defect
in
this
case,
again,
the
remedy
is
one
that
the
commandant
to
correct
the
form
,
it's
not
to
either
--
you
know,
to
grant
him
the
license
--
the
validation
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
am
having
--
to
be
honest
your
honor,
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
with
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
agree
that
they
can
be
--
i
certainly
agree
that
they
can
be
broad
areas
in
which
you
can
inquire
to
our
contention
in
this
case
that
were
ruminated
to
the
what
we
feel
and
i
understand
if
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
court
with
our
reading
of
that
question,
that
when
you're
limiting
your
inquiry
to
organizations
that
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
were
that
list
is
being
used
is
not
per
se
to
exclude
the
person,
but
solely
for
the
purpose
of
starting
an
investigation
which
will
lead
eventually
to
determination,
whether
or
not
that
person
is
presently
qualified,
and
he
presently
presents
possible
danger
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances,
certainly
the
inquiry
is
reasonable.
i
would
agree
wholeheartedly
that
if
a
question
that
was
asked,
you
know
what
church
do
you
belonged
to,
is
not
a
proper
matter
of
inquiry
in
this.
but
i
do
think,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
organizations
here
involved
and
limited
to
that,
that
that
is
a
proper
starting
point
for
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
believe
that
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
black
and
to
a
certain
extent
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
reasonable
starting
place.
the
attorney
general
has
made
some
investigation.
he
has
made
a
determination
as
an
agent
of
the
government,
that
these
organizations
are
organizations
which
have
engaged
in
acts
which
are
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
a
manner
which
would
be
unconstitutional
or
they
have
their
purposes
for
such
activity.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
you
have
--
i
can't
say
that
it
doesn't
carry
with
it
some
proof
of
fact
that
this
is
a
reasonable
starting
place
for
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
approve
the
list.
i
think
what
you
have
to
approve
is
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
for
the
commandant
to
use
this
list
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
can
vary
on
the
use
which
that
information
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
if
the
government
is
going
to
make
a
determination
that
a
person
is
--
is
or
is
not
someone
who
would
jeopardize
the
interest
of
the
government,
if
you're
allowed
to
be
a
sensitive
position,
it
has
to
determine
some
method
and
arriving
on
its
conclusion
that
he
is
or
is
not
person
who
would
use
that
position
improperly.
it
has
to
look
to
his
past
activity
and
has
to
make
some
judgment
on
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
what
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
form
certain
standards
as
to
what
past
activities
might
provide
on
this
person's
present
character
and
if
it
determines
whether
or
not
by
means
of
a
published
list
or
anything
else,
if
the
government
initially
determines
that
certain
activities
and
certain
organizations
are
engaged
in
activities
which
are
engaged
in
errands
to
unconstitutionally
overthrow
our
government,
then
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
want
to
believe
in
this,
but
i
think
the
difference
between
this
is
to
whether
or
not
how
there
--
if
they
are
using
it
to
prove,
they're
not.
our
contention
is
that
they
are
using
this
as
a
starting
point
of
an
investigation,
and
when
they
go
through
that
investigation
and
come
to
a
hearing,
if
they
say
to
this
appellant
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
abc
organization
which
is
designated
by
the
attorney
general's
as
that
being
communist
action
organization
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
fine.
he
is
still
going
to
have
the
opportunity
at
that
point.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but,
i
think
the
important
thing
mr.
justice
black
is
that
if
--
when
they
say
to
him,
because
that
organization
is
listed
by
whoever
you
wanted
to
say
listed,
he's
got
the
right
to
commend
at
a
hearing
and
say
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
--
again
we're
in
--
i
just
don't
believe
that
the
government
is
using
it.
i'm
saying
they're
taking
this
as
a
starting
point
to
the
investigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
no
--
i'm
saying
that
we
have
made
our
investigation
on
this
organization
and
we
find
that
he
is
engaged
in
activities
which
if
you
were
part
of
would
indicate
to
us
that
you
are
not
the
type
of
person
who
can
be
granted
a
sensitive
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
bill
of
attainder.
i
can't
assume
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
find
it
impossible
to
take
your
assumption.
i
don't
think
it
is
because
what
you're
dealing
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
assume
something
as
a
bill
of
attainder
when
what
you're
doing
is
trying
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
can't
answer
on
that
assumption.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
attorney
general's
list
is
a
bill
of
attainder?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
it's
still
can
be
--
could
be
used
because
i
think
that
--
again,
we're
looking
towards
a
present
determination
of
a
character
of
a
particular
man.
there
is
no
other
way
you
can
tell
than
by
looking
at
his
past
acts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i'm
saying
this.
i've
find
difficulty
with
your
assumption
to
begin
with
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do
say
that
the
government
has
to
do
something.
the
man
has
presented
himself
to
be
issued
a
special
validation.
what
is
the
government
to
do?
it's
got
to
investigate
the
man.
it
has
got
to
look
to
his
past
activities
and
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely,
i
would
disagree
with
you.
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
couldn't
be
used,
but
i
think
the
government
has
to
make
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
for
this
purpose,
i
think
the
government
has
to
make
its
investigation
of
two
things.
one,
what
activities
first,
indicate
that
a
man
belonged
to
them
and
participated
in
them
would
be
a
danger
to
the
government.
now,
whether
they
do
that
by
a
published
attorney
general's
list
whether
they
take
that
action
on
their
own
which
is
circulated
to
the
department
--
by
an
agency
in
government
makes
an
investigation
and
says
that
we
have
determined
from
our
investigation
that
these
organizations
are
engaged
in
unconstitutional
efforts
to
overthrow
the
government.
with
that,
they
had
then
made
the
determination
that
there
are
certain
activities
that
a
man
if
he's
engaged
in
unknowingly,
make
it
quite
likely,
that
he
is
not
the
type
of
person
who
should
be
granted
access
to
any
sensitive
position.
the
next
part
of
the
investigation
is
to
look
--
to
see
if
this
man
belonged
to
that
type
of
organization
and
if
he
did,
what
was
the
extent
of
his
participation
in
them?
then
you
can
come
to
the
fact
where
you
inform
the
man
that
we
have
come
to
a
determination
that
you
belong
to
these
organizations
which
we
believe
are
acting
in
a
manner
that
would
--
to
take
unconstitutional
action
to
overthrow
our
government,
and
for
that
reason
you
should
be
denied
your
special
validation.
at
that
point
he's
got
the
right
to
come
back
in
and
say,
one
of
--
several
things.
one,
i
don't
belonged;
two,
i
belonged,
i
did
not
know
of
its
activities;
three,
i
belonged
knowing
full
well
of
its
activities
and
you
are
all
wrong
because
that
is
not
the
activity
to
be
engaged
in,
and
if
he's
got
an
act
--
if
they're
not
engaged
at
any
unconstitutional
activity,
and
he's
got
a
right
to
litigate
those
issues.
so
i
don't
think
viewing
the
entire
process
that
the
question
of
where
you
start
is
necessarily
determined.
i
think
the
government
has
the
right
to
start
at
some
way.
they
have
made
--
the
government
has
made
the
investigation
and
has
determined
in
its
mind,
that
at
least
by
face
these
organizations
are
engaged
to
the
activities
designed
overthrow
the
government.
and
i
think
that
they
can
use
that
as
the
starting
point
to
investigate
an
individual's
activity
to
determine
whether
he
should
be
granted
the
access
to
any
sensitive
position
that
he
seeks.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
would
have
to
answer
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
i
don't
think
that
is
what
is
the
court's
question
is
directed
to.
it's
whether
you're
affiliated
with
the
organization.
it
doesn't
say
in
that
context,
are
you
affiliated
with
an
organization
that
is
somehow
affiliated
with
that,
because
you
were
putting
it
with
that
organization.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
questions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
question
propounded
by
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
when
you're
talking
about
--
certainly
that
question
is
phrased
in
--
if
you're
talking
about
the
communist
party,
it's
phrased,
“are
you
affiliated
with
an
organization?”
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
if
that
question
had
been
asked
with
respect
to
the
church
group,
the
christian
group
that
you
mention
then
i
suppose
of
that
question
would
call
for
the
answer,
yes.
i
think
that
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
is
a
question
i
do
not
have
to
answer,
because
it
deals
with
my
religious
affiliation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
you
know
i
think
that
there
are
questions
that
can
legitimately
be
asked
and
which
a
person
can
be
expected
to
answer,
that
there
are
certainly
there
areas
which
go
beyond,
but
i
don't
think
that's
we're
faced
within
this
case,
and
that
is
a
position
that
government
--
