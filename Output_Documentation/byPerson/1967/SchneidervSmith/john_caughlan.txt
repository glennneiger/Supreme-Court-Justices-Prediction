mr.
john
caughlan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
schroeter
yesterday
outlined
the
basic
societal
values
which
we
believe
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
first,
the
primacy
of
the
individual
embodied
in
concepts,
including
the
first
amendment;
secondly,
the
fairness
of
governmental
procedures
embodied
in
concepts
in
the
constitution
which
include
the
fifth
amendment.
one
additional
one
should
be
added
to
that
and
that
is
the
guarantee
of
governmental
integrity
which
is
embodied
in
the
concept
of
the
separation
of
powers
in
the
constitution.
we
feel
that
this
is
based
upon
fundamentally
the
societal
understanding
that
man
is
fallible,
that
power
corrupts,
and
consequently
includes
basic
principles
such
as
the
division
of
the
three
branches
of
government
and
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
including
bills
of
attainder,
a
prohibition
against
them,
recognizing
that
judicial
process
should
govern
any
question
of
punishment.
the
civilian
control
of
the
military
because
men
trained
in
authority
can
sometimes
to
be
insensitive
to
the
relationship
of
the
individual
in
exercise
of
their
rights
that
we
cherish.
and
finally,
that
the
power
of
the
governments
may
not
be
delegated
one
to
another
and
that
legislative
enactments
and
administrative
rules
carrying
out
those
enactments
must
have
the
clarity
and
precision
particularly
in
relations
in
touching
upon
these
other
fundamental
rights,
so
that
the
individual
can
understand
and
that
the
democratic
values
of
society
maybe
preserved.
with
respect
to
the
last,
we
believe
that
the
regulations
in
the
act
which
is
before
the
court
fails
in
every
particular
and
has
the
fatal
vice
of
vagueness
which
this
court
has
spoken
off
in
many
recent
decisions.
the
regulations
which
i
wish
briefly
again
to
refer
to
mr.
schroeter
did
yesterday,
the
regulations,
first
of
all,
and
these
appear
in
our
brief
on
page
a14,
the
ones
that
i'm
about
to
refer
to,
provide
that
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
determination
of
an
applicant
to
a
coast
guard
whether
he
can
receive
special
validation,
the
commandant
must
be
satisfied,
that
his
character
and
habits
of
life
justify
beliefs
that
he
will
not
be
inimical
to
security.
that's
--
an
additional
regulation
provides
that
if
the
inquires
that
the
commandant
makes
of
any
applicant
are
in
any
way
incomplete,
that
the
commandant
may
obtain
under
oath
additional
information.
and
finally
on
page
a14
regulation
12105
(d)
(2)
that
if
any
applicant
fails
to
furnish
such
additional
information
that
the
commandant
may
require,
he
may
hold
the
application
totally
in
abeyance.
this
is
the
situation
which
we
have
here
that
no
further
action
would
be
taken
and
in
each
case
that
the
mandatory
criteria
which
may
preclude
satisfaction
includes
the
satisfaction
of
the
commandant,
the
absolute
authority
in
him
to
determine
that
the
individual
is
not
inimical.
now,
under
this
procedure
mr.
schneider
was
submitted
a
questionnaire
which
was
referred
to
yesterday
which
required
him
in
effect
to
construct
his
own
loyalty
oath,
that
is
to
set
forth
in
detail
his
association
with
every
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
to
set
forth
in
detail
his
activities,
his
reading,
in
connection
with
the
people's
world,
and
to
detail
his
present
attitude
to
--
mr.
john
caughlan
it's
a
west
coast
newspaper,
a
daily
newspaper,
or
was
at
one
time
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
daily
newspaper
or
not.
it's
a
west
coast
newspaper.
the
--
mr.
john
caughlan
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
officially
sponsored
by
the
communist
party.
i
think
generally,
it
is
regarded
as
expressing
the
communist
party
point
of
view.
his
present
attitude
towards
the
communist
party
was
one
of
the
things
it
would
require
and
their
principles,
his
attitude
or
the
principles
and
objectives
of
that
party,
his
attitude
towards
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
for
the
reasons
that
are
already
been
stated
to
this
court,
mr.
schneider
having
and
feeling
it
was
impossible
to
have
an
idea
of
what
was
required,
refused
under
penalty
of
perjury
to
construct
in
effect
this
loyalty
oath.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
couldn't
imagine
your
honor.
it
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
who
read
a
paper
to
set
this
forth
in
any
reasonable
length
of
time
especially
during
periods
of
daily
paper
and
even
after
that.
so,
i
would
believe
mr.
justice
black
that
this
wouldn't
virtually
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
answer.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
paper
itself
has
15
to
20
volumes,
of
thick
ones
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
long
it
would
take
it,
i
believe
it
would
be
impossible.
although
this
question
--
these
inquiries
appeared
in
the
guise
of
a
questionnaire,
we
feel
that
they
are
indistinguishable
in
the
inner
impact
and
effect
from
the
construction
of
a
loyalty
oath.
and
indeed
a
loyalty
oath
that
is
far
broader
than
anything
has
ever
come
before
this
court
which
has
been
considered
in
the
teacher-public-employee
cases,
the
oath
required
public
workers
and
has
been
denounced
in
the
line
of
decisions
which
extend
from
cramp
to
shelton,
although
that
is
a
slightly
different
type
of
oath,
to
baggett,
to
elfbrandt,
to
keyishian,
and
the
case
decided
this
term
whitehill
versus
elkins.
the
underlying
purpose,
it
seems
to
us
of
each
of
these
procedures,
the
questionnaire
we
have
in
this
case,
the
teachers
and
public
employee
oath
that
we
have
in
the
other
cases
is
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
perhaps
well
meaning
that
we
believe
misguided
public
officials
and
legislatures
to
weed
out
dissidents,
persons
who
disagree
or
wish
to
disagree
with
the
status
quo.
it's
no
accident,
we
think
that
in
each
one
of
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court,
these
had
been
answered
previously,
the
actions
had
been
instituted
by
teachers
who
are
sincere
and
thoughtful
people
and
have
opportunity
and
time
and
consideration
to
understand
the
full
implications
of
this
oath.
and
perhaps
it's
no
accident
that
this
comes
up
before
--
this
case
come
before
the
court
from
a
seaman
who
we
believe
is
unquestionably
sincere
also,
but
who
is
not
in
the
status
of
a
teacher
who
wished
to
sail
and
who
therefore
attempted
his
best
to
meet
the
initial
procedures
until
he
has
submitted
the
questionnaire
which
is
before
the
court.
but
as
this
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
elfbrandt
case,
it
is
the
sincere,
the
persons
of
integrity
who
do
bring
these
cases
who
needs
oath
to
effect
because
others
can
construct
their
answer
false
oath
or
they
do
not
have
the
sort
of
integrity
and
sincerity
which
is
required,
or
which
persons
who
present
the
issue
for
public
consideration
and
consideration
by
this
court.
but
it's
precisely
the
same
compelled
conformity
which
is
before
the
court
in
every
instance,
and
here
we
have
clearly
a
situation
where
the
interrogatory
procedure
takes
the
place
of
the
oath
procedure
in
the
teacher
cases,
where
the
determination
here
is
whether,
if
i
can
put
it
this
way,
the
applicant
to
the
coast
guard's
point
of
view
has
what
we
would
call
a
bad
first
amendment
character
because
of
his
associations,
because
of
his
reading,
and
because
of
his
attitudes.
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
statement
ultimately
made
by
this
court
last
monday,
in
the
decision
to
the
robel
case,
is
particularly
applicable
here
that
it
would
be
ironic
if
the
name
of
national
defense,
we
would
sanction
subversion
of
those
liberties
which
we
cherished
and
which
make
the
defense
of
the
nation
worthwhile.
and
these
points
to
the
origin
of
the
vagueness
which
is
before
this
court
which
is
found
in
the
magnuson
act
itself
because
the
magnuson
act
authorizes,
in
it's
principle
amendment
to
previous
legislation,
was
to
authorize
rules
and
regulations,
to
authorize
procedures
by
the
president
when
he
found
that
the
country
was
endangered
by
subversive
activity
or
subversion.
this
word
itself
as
indicated
by
its
use
in
the
robel
decision
is
a
word
of
the
widest
meaning,
generally
it
means
bad
politics,
bad
from
who's
point
of
view,
bad
in
that
it
may
subvert
constitutional
principle,
bad
in
someone
else's
mind
because
subversion
may
mean
refusal
to
conform
to
the
status
quo.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there,
i
believe,
have
been
three
cases
--
the
barrow
case
and
the
two
others
involving,
in
each
case,
(inaudible)
in
which
petition
for
certiorari
or
yes
each
case
was
petition
for
certiorari
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
they
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief
your
honors.
we
believe
the
fact
--
mr.
john
caughlan
the
government
relies
on
the
position
that
the
--
mr.
justice
black
that
the
--
basically,
that
the
applicant
must
answer
the
questions,
but
under
the
regulations,
the
questions
must
include
answers
to
membership
in
each
one
of
the
280
and
more
organizations
that
are
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
in
this
amplified
by
the
interrogatories
which
require
the
applicant
to
explain
in
detail
his
relationship
to
any
organization
which
he
belongs
and
i
might
add
in
this
case,
this
includes
on
the
attorney
general's
list
which
had
promulgated
long
after
some
of
the
organizations
to
my
knowledge
had
become
defunct
such
as
the
washington
common
law
federation
which
in
the
state
of
washington
if
one
were
to
include
sympathetic
associates
of
that,
would
include
most
of
the
public
officials
during
one
period
of
time
or
many
of
them,
most
of
the
democratic
officials
that
included
such
organizations
as
the
labor
schools,
the
seattle
labor
school,
the
north
pacific
northwest
labor
school
which
was
facultied
by
numerous
teachers
at
the
university
of
washington,
it
includes
the
harry
bridges'
defense
committee
which
presumably
ceased
to
exist
after
his
defense
became
unnecessary.
but
these
all
appear
on
the
list
along
with
many,
many
other
organizations
and
i
would
assume
that
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
applicant
in
this
case
who
is
an
alert
person
and
was
aligned
during
the
period
of
time
when
this
happen,
must
have
had
not
only
membership,
but
sympathetic
association,
affiliation
or
even
sympathetic
association
with
these
organization
which
is
also
included.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
we
--
in
addition
your
honor
to
the
vagueness
argument
which
we're
making
at
the
present
time,
we
also
wish
to
discuss
the
list
as
used
in
this
case
and
on
its
face
as
a
plain
bill
of
attainder
which
we
believe
was
the
position
that
your
honor
took
about
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
case.
we
believe
that
it's
used
here,
it
is
a
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
john
caughlan
indeed
we
do.
mr.
john
caughlan
indeed
we
do.
if
i
may
anticipate
at
that
moment,
the
argument
we
intend
to
make
then
i
would
say
this.
with
respect
to
this
case,
this
isn't
all
--
we
see
it,
always,
as
if
this
had
come
before
the
court,
if
the
power
to
construct
these
regulations
at
all
exists,
this
case
comes
before
the
court
as
though
the
congress
had
written
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
is
authorized
to
deny
the
application
of
any
person
who
is
or
has
been
a
member,
sympathetically
associated
or
affiliated
with
any
of
the
organizations
on
that
list.
if
the
powers
are
delegated
to
do
that,
this
appears
before
the
court
in
that
respect.
now
the
only
difference
that
we
see
here
is
that
instead
of
saying
he
must
deny
the
application,
it
says
he
may
deny
the
application,
but
in
the
context
of
these
regulations
we
feel
that
it
is
most
unlikely
that
an
administrative
official
would
approve
an
application
of
someone
who
didn't
disclaim
present
sympathy
or
association
or
sympathetic
attitude
toward
any
of
these
organizations.
we
feel
that
the
commandant
would
feel
impelled
that
he
must
ask
the
question
under
the
regulations,
would
feel
that
any
sympathetic
relation
to
these
organizations
would
atomically
preclude
denial.
that
would
be
argued
no
doubt
that
he
may
approve,
but
we
believe
he
would
only
approve
if
the
applicant
had
somehow
disclaimed
knowledge
or
repudiated
the
organizations.
mr.
john
caughlan
precisely,
because
the
regulations
say
if
you
don't
answer
these
questions
we
postpone
any
further
consideration
of
your
case
until
you
have
answered
the
questions.
so
administrative
remedies
simply
do
not
exist
unless
you
throw
away
your
constitutional
rights
before
you
start
and
that's
the
reason
that
we
cannot
believe,
that
the
government
can
seriously
argue
that
there
can
be
any
problem,
exhaustion
in
the
administrative
remedies
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
caughlan
we
believe
that
the
executive
order
in
effect
sets
forth
the
basis
for
the
regulations.
of
course
the
regulations
are
over
broad.
we
will
present
arguments
since
we've
discussed
about
bill
of
attainder,
i
will
talk
about
it
this
time
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
this
statute,
though
clearly
vague
on
its
face
because
of
the
importation
into
it
of
this
concept
of
subversive
activity,
and
giving
authority
for
the
executive
order
only
on
the
basis
of
subversive
activity
that
the
statute
itself
doesn't
authorize
the
procedures
which
the
coast
guard
has
here
instituted
in
these
regulations.
now,
let
me
spell
it
out
on
some
detail.
the
magnuson
act
enacted
in
1950
is
simply
an
additional
two
paragraphs
to
an
already
existing
act,
the
act
of
june
15th,
1917
enacted
two
months
after
the
commencement
of
world
war
i.
this
--
the
first
two
--
the
first
paragraph
which
appears
as
appendix
a1
of
our
brief
authorizes
the
president,
in
case
of
war
or
national
emergency
with
proclamation,
declaration
of
war,
disturbance
of
international
relations
to
take
full
possession
of
all
foreign
or
domestic
vessels
and
remove
there
from
members
of
the
crew
who
aren't
especially
authorized
to
go
aboard.
it
is
clearly
and
unmistakably
a
war
power.
it's
one
of
some
13
titles
in
what
in
effect
is
the
war
powers
act
of
1917
and
applies
only
in
case
of
a
national
emergency
or
in
cases
of
a
proclamation
based
on
disturbance
of
international
relationships.
the
magnuson
act
adds
to
this
power
which
the
president
has
under
emergency
or
war
situations,
the
provision
that
whenever
the
president
finds
security
endangered
by
reason
of
subversive
activity,
he
maybe
do
two
things;
part
a,
with
respect
to
foreign-flag
vessels
only,
he
may
place
guards
there
on,
take
full
possession
of
the
vessels
that
he
wishes,
and
remove
all
persons
not
especially
authorized
by
him
to
go
aboard
those
foreign-flag
vessels.
secondly,
and
as
the
second
part
of
the
act
and
independent
from
this
and
separate
from
it,
it
gives
the
president
the
power
to
safeguard
against
destruction,
loss
or
injury
from
sabotage,
subversive
acts,
accidents
or
other
causes
of
similar
nature.
the
maritime
facilities
of
the
united
states,
and
it
was
indicated
by
senator
magnuson
and
no
doubt
of
course,
that
the
government
has
a
very
direct
interest
in
protecting
these
facilities,
just
pointed
out
that
no
authority
existed
to
protect
docks
and
so
forth
in
time
of
danger
and
in
the
argument
before
the
congress
which
is
set
forth
in
--
which
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
this
was
the
principal
basis
for
this
addition
of
the
magnuson
act.
it
says
nothing
about
removing
members
of
crews
and
we
believe
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
have
the
same
the
puzzle
with
that
your
honor.
i
have
read
this
a
dozen
times,
but
i
can't
make
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
caughlan
no.
we
have
been
puzzled
over
that
mr.
justice
fortas
that
we
just
can't
make
it
come
out
to
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
caughlan
yes
it
is,
yes
sir.
but
on
the
basis
of
we
believe
the
emergency
war
powers
which
do
--
which
existed
before
the
magnuson
acts
and
which
do
authorize,
we
could
say
screening
with
respect
to
domestic
vessels,
this
act
does
not,
the
new
part
of
the
act
does
not
apply
to
the
removal
of
crews
in
vessels
except
under
the
old
act
in
national
emergency
and
we
believe
that
the
government's
argument
in
this
respect
really
is
misleading
and
misleads
occur.
i'll
refer
to
what
is
said
in
the
government's
argument
on
pages
15
and
16
of
their
brief
in
which
they
imply
directly
that
the
act
provides,
if
the
president
finds
it
necessary,
in
order
to
protect
any
vessel
at
harbor
for
damage
or
injury,
he
may
take
full
possession
of
such
vessel
and
remove
them
from
--
the
officers
and
crews
from
it.
now,
this
applies
only
under
the
national
emergency
sections
so
that
as
far
as
our
reading
of
this
act
is
concerned,
no
authority
whatever
exists
for
the
program
which
the
coast
guard
have
used.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
first
full
paragraph
is
the
1917
legislation.
mr.
john
caughlan
oh,
this
is
the
only
one
of
13
titles,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
all
there
is
on
this
subject.
there
isn't
anything
more
that
refers
to
the
control
of
maritime
facilities
and
vessels.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
represents
two
little
amendments,
but
the
basic
1950
legislation
that
--
mr.
john
caughlan
--
begins
whenever
the
president
finds
the
security,
that's
the
magnuson
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
caughlan
and
that
is
all
of
it.
now
there
is
--
mr.
john
caughlan
but
there
is
one
additional
paragraph
which
we
haven't
included
which
provides
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
aboard
vessels
in
violation
of
the
national
emergency
provisions
of
the
first
paragraph.
in
other
words
the
original
act
does
not
--
mr.
john
caughlan
that's
correct.
may
we
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
john
caughlan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
schroeter
yesterday
outlined
the
basic
societal
values
which
we
believe
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
first,
the
primacy
of
the
individual
embodied
in
concepts,
including
the
first
amendment;
secondly,
the
fairness
of
governmental
procedures
embodied
in
concepts
in
the
constitution
which
include
the
fifth
amendment.
one
additional
one
should
be
added
to
that
and
that
is
the
guarantee
of
governmental
integrity
which
is
embodied
in
the
concept
of
the
separation
of
powers
in
the
constitution.
we
feel
that
this
is
based
upon
fundamentally
the
societal
understanding
that
man
is
fallible,
that
power
corrupts,
and
consequently
includes
basic
principles
such
as
the
division
of
the
three
branches
of
government
and
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
including
bills
of
attainder,
a
prohibition
against
them,
recognizing
that
judicial
process
should
govern
any
question
of
punishment.
the
civilian
control
of
the
military
because
men
trained
in
authority
can
sometimes
to
be
insensitive
to
the
relationship
of
the
individual
in
exercise
of
their
rights
that
we
cherish.
and
finally,
that
the
power
of
the
governments
may
not
be
delegated
one
to
another
and
that
legislative
enactments
and
administrative
rules
carrying
out
those
enactments
must
have
the
clarity
and
precision
particularly
in
relations
in
touching
upon
these
other
fundamental
rights,
so
that
the
individual
can
understand
and
that
the
democratic
values
of
society
maybe
preserved.
with
respect
to
the
last,
we
believe
that
the
regulations
in
the
act
which
is
before
the
court
fails
in
every
particular
and
has
the
fatal
vice
of
vagueness
which
this
court
has
spoken
off
in
many
recent
decisions.
the
regulations
which
i
wish
briefly
again
to
refer
to
mr.
schroeter
did
yesterday,
the
regulations,
first
of
all,
and
these
appear
in
our
brief
on
page
a14,
the
ones
that
i'm
about
to
refer
to,
provide
that
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
determination
of
an
applicant
to
a
coast
guard
whether
he
can
receive
special
validation,
the
commandant
must
be
satisfied,
that
his
character
and
habits
of
life
justify
beliefs
that
he
will
not
be
inimical
to
security.
that's
--
an
additional
regulation
provides
that
if
the
inquires
that
the
commandant
makes
of
any
applicant
are
in
any
way
incomplete,
that
the
commandant
may
obtain
under
oath
additional
information.
and
finally
on
page
a14
regulation
12105
(d)
(2)
that
if
any
applicant
fails
to
furnish
such
additional
information
that
the
commandant
may
require,
he
may
hold
the
application
totally
in
abeyance.
this
is
the
situation
which
we
have
here
that
no
further
action
would
be
taken
and
in
each
case
that
the
mandatory
criteria
which
may
preclude
satisfaction
includes
the
satisfaction
of
the
commandant,
the
absolute
authority
in
him
to
determine
that
the
individual
is
not
inimical.
now,
under
this
procedure
mr.
schneider
was
submitted
a
questionnaire
which
was
referred
to
yesterday
which
required
him
in
effect
to
construct
his
own
loyalty
oath,
that
is
to
set
forth
in
detail
his
association
with
every
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
to
set
forth
in
detail
his
activities,
his
reading,
in
connection
with
the
people's
world,
and
to
detail
his
present
attitude
to
--
mr.
john
caughlan
it's
a
west
coast
newspaper,
a
daily
newspaper,
or
was
at
one
time
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
daily
newspaper
or
not.
it's
a
west
coast
newspaper.
the
--
mr.
john
caughlan
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
officially
sponsored
by
the
communist
party.
i
think
generally,
it
is
regarded
as
expressing
the
communist
party
point
of
view.
his
present
attitude
towards
the
communist
party
was
one
of
the
things
it
would
require
and
their
principles,
his
attitude
or
the
principles
and
objectives
of
that
party,
his
attitude
towards
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
for
the
reasons
that
are
already
been
stated
to
this
court,
mr.
schneider
having
and
feeling
it
was
impossible
to
have
an
idea
of
what
was
required,
refused
under
penalty
of
perjury
to
construct
in
effect
this
loyalty
oath.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
couldn't
imagine
your
honor.
it
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
who
read
a
paper
to
set
this
forth
in
any
reasonable
length
of
time
especially
during
periods
of
daily
paper
and
even
after
that.
so,
i
would
believe
mr.
justice
black
that
this
wouldn't
virtually
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
answer.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
paper
itself
has
15
to
20
volumes,
of
thick
ones
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
long
it
would
take
it,
i
believe
it
would
be
impossible.
although
this
question
--
these
inquiries
appeared
in
the
guise
of
a
questionnaire,
we
feel
that
they
are
indistinguishable
in
the
inner
impact
and
effect
from
the
construction
of
a
loyalty
oath.
and
indeed
a
loyalty
oath
that
is
far
broader
than
anything
has
ever
come
before
this
court
which
has
been
considered
in
the
teacher-public-employee
cases,
the
oath
required
public
workers
and
has
been
denounced
in
the
line
of
decisions
which
extend
from
cramp
to
shelton,
although
that
is
a
slightly
different
type
of
oath,
to
baggett,
to
elfbrandt,
to
keyishian,
and
the
case
decided
this
term
whitehill
versus
elkins.
the
underlying
purpose,
it
seems
to
us
of
each
of
these
procedures,
the
questionnaire
we
have
in
this
case,
the
teachers
and
public
employee
oath
that
we
have
in
the
other
cases
is
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
perhaps
well
meaning
that
we
believe
misguided
public
officials
and
legislatures
to
weed
out
dissidents,
persons
who
disagree
or
wish
to
disagree
with
the
status
quo.
it's
no
accident,
we
think
that
in
each
one
of
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court,
these
had
been
answered
previously,
the
actions
had
been
instituted
by
teachers
who
are
sincere
and
thoughtful
people
and
have
opportunity
and
time
and
consideration
to
understand
the
full
implications
of
this
oath.
and
perhaps
it's
no
accident
that
this
comes
up
before
--
this
case
come
before
the
court
from
a
seaman
who
we
believe
is
unquestionably
sincere
also,
but
who
is
not
in
the
status
of
a
teacher
who
wished
to
sail
and
who
therefore
attempted
his
best
to
meet
the
initial
procedures
until
he
has
submitted
the
questionnaire
which
is
before
the
court.
but
as
this
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
elfbrandt
case,
it
is
the
sincere,
the
persons
of
integrity
who
do
bring
these
cases
who
needs
oath
to
effect
because
others
can
construct
their
answer
false
oath
or
they
do
not
have
the
sort
of
integrity
and
sincerity
which
is
required,
or
which
persons
who
present
the
issue
for
public
consideration
and
consideration
by
this
court.
but
it's
precisely
the
same
compelled
conformity
which
is
before
the
court
in
every
instance,
and
here
we
have
clearly
a
situation
where
the
interrogatory
procedure
takes
the
place
of
the
oath
procedure
in
the
teacher
cases,
where
the
determination
here
is
whether,
if
i
can
put
it
this
way,
the
applicant
to
the
coast
guard's
point
of
view
has
what
we
would
call
a
bad
first
amendment
character
because
of
his
associations,
because
of
his
reading,
and
because
of
his
attitudes.
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
statement
ultimately
made
by
this
court
last
monday,
in
the
decision
to
the
robel
case,
is
particularly
applicable
here
that
it
would
be
ironic
if
the
name
of
national
defense,
we
would
sanction
subversion
of
those
liberties
which
we
cherished
and
which
make
the
defense
of
the
nation
worthwhile.
and
these
points
to
the
origin
of
the
vagueness
which
is
before
this
court
which
is
found
in
the
magnuson
act
itself
because
the
magnuson
act
authorizes,
in
it's
principle
amendment
to
previous
legislation,
was
to
authorize
rules
and
regulations,
to
authorize
procedures
by
the
president
when
he
found
that
the
country
was
endangered
by
subversive
activity
or
subversion.
this
word
itself
as
indicated
by
its
use
in
the
robel
decision
is
a
word
of
the
widest
meaning,
generally
it
means
bad
politics,
bad
from
who's
point
of
view,
bad
in
that
it
may
subvert
constitutional
principle,
bad
in
someone
else's
mind
because
subversion
may
mean
refusal
to
conform
to
the
status
quo.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there,
i
believe,
have
been
three
cases
--
the
barrow
case
and
the
two
others
involving,
in
each
case,
(inaudible)
in
which
petition
for
certiorari
or
yes
each
case
was
petition
for
certiorari
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
they
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief
your
honors.
we
believe
the
fact
--
mr.
john
caughlan
the
government
relies
on
the
position
that
the
--
mr.
justice
black
that
the
--
basically,
that
the
applicant
must
answer
the
questions,
but
under
the
regulations,
the
questions
must
include
answers
to
membership
in
each
one
of
the
280
and
more
organizations
that
are
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
in
this
amplified
by
the
interrogatories
which
require
the
applicant
to
explain
in
detail
his
relationship
to
any
organization
which
he
belongs
and
i
might
add
in
this
case,
this
includes
on
the
attorney
general's
list
which
had
promulgated
long
after
some
of
the
organizations
to
my
knowledge
had
become
defunct
such
as
the
washington
common
law
federation
which
in
the
state
of
washington
if
one
were
to
include
sympathetic
associates
of
that,
would
include
most
of
the
public
officials
during
one
period
of
time
or
many
of
them,
most
of
the
democratic
officials
that
included
such
organizations
as
the
labor
schools,
the
seattle
labor
school,
the
north
pacific
northwest
labor
school
which
was
facultied
by
numerous
teachers
at
the
university
of
washington,
it
includes
the
harry
bridges'
defense
committee
which
presumably
ceased
to
exist
after
his
defense
became
unnecessary.
but
these
all
appear
on
the
list
along
with
many,
many
other
organizations
and
i
would
assume
that
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
applicant
in
this
case
who
is
an
alert
person
and
was
aligned
during
the
period
of
time
when
this
happen,
must
have
had
not
only
membership,
but
sympathetic
association,
affiliation
or
even
sympathetic
association
with
these
organization
which
is
also
included.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
we
--
in
addition
your
honor
to
the
vagueness
argument
which
we're
making
at
the
present
time,
we
also
wish
to
discuss
the
list
as
used
in
this
case
and
on
its
face
as
a
plain
bill
of
attainder
which
we
believe
was
the
position
that
your
honor
took
about
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
case.
we
believe
that
it's
used
here,
it
is
a
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
john
caughlan
indeed
we
do.
mr.
john
caughlan
indeed
we
do.
if
i
may
anticipate
at
that
moment,
the
argument
we
intend
to
make
then
i
would
say
this.
with
respect
to
this
case,
this
isn't
all
--
we
see
it,
always,
as
if
this
had
come
before
the
court,
if
the
power
to
construct
these
regulations
at
all
exists,
this
case
comes
before
the
court
as
though
the
congress
had
written
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
is
authorized
to
deny
the
application
of
any
person
who
is
or
has
been
a
member,
sympathetically
associated
or
affiliated
with
any
of
the
organizations
on
that
list.
if
the
powers
are
delegated
to
do
that,
this
appears
before
the
court
in
that
respect.
now
the
only
difference
that
we
see
here
is
that
instead
of
saying
he
must
deny
the
application,
it
says
he
may
deny
the
application,
but
in
the
context
of
these
regulations
we
feel
that
it
is
most
unlikely
that
an
administrative
official
would
approve
an
application
of
someone
who
didn't
disclaim
present
sympathy
or
association
or
sympathetic
attitude
toward
any
of
these
organizations.
we
feel
that
the
commandant
would
feel
impelled
that
he
must
ask
the
question
under
the
regulations,
would
feel
that
any
sympathetic
relation
to
these
organizations
would
atomically
preclude
denial.
that
would
be
argued
no
doubt
that
he
may
approve,
but
we
believe
he
would
only
approve
if
the
applicant
had
somehow
disclaimed
knowledge
or
repudiated
the
organizations.
mr.
john
caughlan
precisely,
because
the
regulations
say
if
you
don't
answer
these
questions
we
postpone
any
further
consideration
of
your
case
until
you
have
answered
the
questions.
so
administrative
remedies
simply
do
not
exist
unless
you
throw
away
your
constitutional
rights
before
you
start
and
that's
the
reason
that
we
cannot
believe,
that
the
government
can
seriously
argue
that
there
can
be
any
problem,
exhaustion
in
the
administrative
remedies
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
caughlan
we
believe
that
the
executive
order
in
effect
sets
forth
the
basis
for
the
regulations.
of
course
the
regulations
are
over
broad.
we
will
present
arguments
since
we've
discussed
about
bill
of
attainder,
i
will
talk
about
it
this
time
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
this
statute,
though
clearly
vague
on
its
face
because
of
the
importation
into
it
of
this
concept
of
subversive
activity,
and
giving
authority
for
the
executive
order
only
on
the
basis
of
subversive
activity
that
the
statute
itself
doesn't
authorize
the
procedures
which
the
coast
guard
has
here
instituted
in
these
regulations.
now,
let
me
spell
it
out
on
some
detail.
the
magnuson
act
enacted
in
1950
is
simply
an
additional
two
paragraphs
to
an
already
existing
act,
the
act
of
june
15th,
1917
enacted
two
months
after
the
commencement
of
world
war
i.
this
--
the
first
two
--
the
first
paragraph
which
appears
as
appendix
a1
of
our
brief
authorizes
the
president,
in
case
of
war
or
national
emergency
with
proclamation,
declaration
of
war,
disturbance
of
international
relations
to
take
full
possession
of
all
foreign
or
domestic
vessels
and
remove
there
from
members
of
the
crew
who
aren't
especially
authorized
to
go
aboard.
it
is
clearly
and
unmistakably
a
war
power.
it's
one
of
some
13
titles
in
what
in
effect
is
the
war
powers
act
of
1917
and
applies
only
in
case
of
a
national
emergency
or
in
cases
of
a
proclamation
based
on
disturbance
of
international
relationships.
the
magnuson
act
adds
to
this
power
which
the
president
has
under
emergency
or
war
situations,
the
provision
that
whenever
the
president
finds
security
endangered
by
reason
of
subversive
activity,
he
maybe
do
two
things;
part
a,
with
respect
to
foreign-flag
vessels
only,
he
may
place
guards
there
on,
take
full
possession
of
the
vessels
that
he
wishes,
and
remove
all
persons
not
especially
authorized
by
him
to
go
aboard
those
foreign-flag
vessels.
secondly,
and
as
the
second
part
of
the
act
and
independent
from
this
and
separate
from
it,
it
gives
the
president
the
power
to
safeguard
against
destruction,
loss
or
injury
from
sabotage,
subversive
acts,
accidents
or
other
causes
of
similar
nature.
the
maritime
facilities
of
the
united
states,
and
it
was
indicated
by
senator
magnuson
and
no
doubt
of
course,
that
the
government
has
a
very
direct
interest
in
protecting
these
facilities,
just
pointed
out
that
no
authority
existed
to
protect
docks
and
so
forth
in
time
of
danger
and
in
the
argument
before
the
congress
which
is
set
forth
in
--
which
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
this
was
the
principal
basis
for
this
addition
of
the
magnuson
act.
it
says
nothing
about
removing
members
of
crews
and
we
believe
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
have
the
same
the
puzzle
with
that
your
honor.
i
have
read
this
a
dozen
times,
but
i
can't
make
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
caughlan
no.
we
have
been
puzzled
over
that
mr.
justice
fortas
that
we
just
can't
make
it
come
out
to
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
caughlan
yes
it
is,
yes
sir.
but
on
the
basis
of
we
believe
the
emergency
war
powers
which
do
--
which
existed
before
the
magnuson
acts
and
which
do
authorize,
we
could
say
screening
with
respect
to
domestic
vessels,
this
act
does
not,
the
new
part
of
the
act
does
not
apply
to
the
removal
of
crews
in
vessels
except
under
the
old
act
in
national
emergency
and
we
believe
that
the
government's
argument
in
this
respect
really
is
misleading
and
misleads
occur.
i'll
refer
to
what
is
said
in
the
government's
argument
on
pages
15
and
16
of
their
brief
in
which
they
imply
directly
that
the
act
provides,
if
the
president
finds
it
necessary,
in
order
to
protect
any
vessel
at
harbor
for
damage
or
injury,
he
may
take
full
possession
of
such
vessel
and
remove
them
from
--
the
officers
and
crews
from
it.
now,
this
applies
only
under
the
national
emergency
sections
so
that
as
far
as
our
reading
of
this
act
is
concerned,
no
authority
whatever
exists
for
the
program
which
the
coast
guard
have
used.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
first
full
paragraph
is
the
1917
legislation.
mr.
john
caughlan
oh,
this
is
the
only
one
of
13
titles,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
all
there
is
on
this
subject.
there
isn't
anything
more
that
refers
to
the
control
of
maritime
facilities
and
vessels.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
represents
two
little
amendments,
but
the
basic
1950
legislation
that
--
mr.
john
caughlan
--
begins
whenever
the
president
finds
the
security,
that's
the
magnuson
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
caughlan
and
that
is
all
of
it.
now
there
is
--
mr.
john
caughlan
but
there
is
one
additional
paragraph
which
we
haven't
included
which
provides
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
aboard
vessels
in
violation
of
the
national
emergency
provisions
of
the
first
paragraph.
in
other
words
the
original
act
does
not
--
mr.
john
caughlan
that's
correct.
may
we
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
your
honor.
thank
you.
